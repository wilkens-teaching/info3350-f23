    "    * Features may be in conflict, in the sense that an object may have some features that are associated with one class and others that are associated with another class.\n",

    "* The latter part -- the underlying proabability of class $C$ and the probability of the feature values given class $C$ -- is what you learn from your training data.\n",
    "* You can then assign class labels in your test set on the basis of the class with the highest predicted probability given the evidence.\n",
    "* Note difference between Bernoulli, Gaussian, and multinomial NB (each of which is a different classifier type in `sklearn`): \n",
    "    * Bernoulli NB is for use with binary features (encoding the presence or absence of a word type in a document, for example). You would use this if you binarized your features at vectorization.\n",

    "    * Gaussian NB is for use with continuous variables, including TF-IDF weighted and/or normalized word counts.\n",

    "### Measuring classifier performance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture -- and for the next couple of weeks -- we'll talk about factors that affect classifier performance. But how should we *measure* performance? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we scored our classifiers on **accuracy**, that is, the fraction of all predictions that are correct. This can be fine, but it's not well suited to cases in which we have different-size classes and it doesn't capture whether we do equally well on any one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning tends instead to measure performance using **precision**, **recall**, and $F_1$. Here's what those terms mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Precision** is the fraction of positive predictions for a given class that are correct. In other words, when we predict that an object belongs to a class, how likely are we to be right about it?\n",
    "* **Recall** is the fraction of all positive instances in the data set that are predicted positive. In other words, from among all the objects we *should* have assigned to a class, what fraction of them did we catch?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that precision and recall tend to involve a tradeoff in real-world settings. You can achieve high precision if you're very conservative about labeling marginal cases. You can get high recall by being much more liberal with your labels. Consider two limit cases of a simple problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I ask you to bring me all the books by Toni Morrison that are held in the Cornell libraries. Favoring precision, you bring me just one book, a first-edition copy of _The Bluest Eye_ (great book, by the way) and nothing else. You're right that it's by Morrison, so your precision is perfect (1.0). But your recall is really bad. If there are 108 Morrison volumes in the library (which there are, for certain deifnitions of \"by\", \"in\", \"Cornell,\" \"libraries,\" and \"books\"), you have correctly retrieved less than 1% of them. Or maybe you favor recall, so you bring me every book in the library (about 8 million of them). Yikes. In this case, recall is perfect (you *did* bring me every book by Morrison), but your precision is terrible (of the 8 million books you labeled as \"by Toni Morrison,\" only 108 of them were correct (about 0.001%).\n",
    "\n",
    "* $F_1$ is one way to assess the combination of precision and recall. It's just the *harmonic mean* of those two numbers. A harmonic mean is a conservative estimate of the average value, because it is affected more by small values than by large ones. \n",
    "    * You don't really need to know how to calculate $F_1$, but it's not hard. You take the reciprocal of the (familiar, plain vanilla) arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of your observations.\n",
    "    * In the first Morrison example (high precision, low recall), precision = 1.0 and recall = 0.01 (rounding a bit). \n",
    "    * The regular (non-harmonic) mean would be about 0.5 ($=(1.0 + 0.01)/2$)\n",
    "    * $F_1$ is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$F_1 = \\left( \\frac{1.0^{-1}+0.01^{-1}}{2} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{2}{1 + 100} = 0.02$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_1$ for the high-recall case would be even worse, since precision in that case is even closer to zero. Most real-world cases aren't as extreme as these, but the idea is the same. $F_1$ avoids artificially inflated estimates of classifier performance. In general, it's what you (and other machine learning researchers) want to use as your accuracy/performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross validation\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll have noticed that we presented our scores above both with and without **cross validation**, and that the cross-validated numbers were lower. What's that about?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you train a classifier (or any other learning system), you're learning things about the structure of your data. You do that by associating feature values with expected outputs (such as class labels, numerical values, etc.). You measure the performance of the system by evaluating how often the predictions of the system are correct (or by how much they are incorrect).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you train and test on the same data, you're at risk of **overfitting**, that is, of learning very specific details of your training data that will not generalize to new data sampled from the same underlying population (but that is not identical to the training data). You run this risk because you never examine any new data for which you know the true labels, so you can't measure how your system performs on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wise approach, then, is to **hold out** some of your labeled data as a test set. You then train on the rest and evaluate the performance of the model on the held-out data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the data you've held out just happens to be non-representative of the full data set (as might happen if you don't have very much labeled data to begin with, or if its features are somehow unevenly distributed in ways unknown to you)? Or what if you just get (un)lucky with any particular **train-test split**? You can minimize that problem by performing multiple train-test splits (perhaps five or ten of them, say), each time holding out a different subset of the labeled data and training over the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating performance over multiple different train-test splits is called **cross validation**. It is always best practice to report the performance of a classifier (or any other learning system) using cross validation. At minimum, you should report the average performance across all splits (also called **folds**, as in *k*-fold cross validation). In a perfect world, you might perform very many randomized splits and report both the mean and some measure of dispersion (like standard deviation or a confidence interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "Always assume that you should perform cross validation for any supervised system, unless you have a very good reason not to. (Whatever reason you're thinking of, it's probably not good enough.)"
