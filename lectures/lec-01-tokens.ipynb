    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a token?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **smallest individually meaningful unit of a document.** Roughly, a word.\n",
    "* But ... as soon as you see \"meaningful,\" you know it's going to be a matter of interpretation.\n",
    "  * *Every single thing you do in text analysis is an interpretive intervention!*\n",
    "* Not all tokens are (single) words. For example:\n",
    "  * **Contractions**. `\"I'm\"` or `\"can't\"`. One token or two?\n",
    "  * **Phrases.** `\"San Francisco\"` or `\"Cornell University\"`. Two tokens or one?\n",
    "    * These are exampled of \"named entities.\" We'll revisit them later in the semester.\n",
    "  * **Punctuation.** Count it at all? Is `\"this\"` the same token as `\"this!\"`? Is `\".\"` or `\";\"` a token on its own?\n",
    "  * **Domain-specific terms.** `\"@user\"`, `\"COVID-19\"`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why tokenize?\n",
    "\n",
    "Words suggest meaning. This is the wager and the starting point of many text analysis methods.\n",
    "  * If we can identify words, we can count them.\n",
    "  * Words are small enough to recur, so not all counts are `1` (which isn't very informative)\n",
    "    * Hence we can compare word counts across contexts\n",
    "    * Compare to sentences (or paragraphs, or full documents), which are often globally unique\n",
    "  * If we we can count words, we can quantify (aspects of) a text that contains those words.\n",
    "  * **If we can quantify a text, we can compute with it.**\n",
    "  * **This is the most common way that text becomes data!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that quantifying a text isn't the same thing as being *correct* about what that text means, nor is meaning solely a function of word counts(!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is part of the more-or-less standard text-processing workflow. Other parts of that workflow might include:\n",
    "  * Case regularization/folding\n",
    "  * Punctuation removal\n",
    "  * Lemmatization or stemming\n",
    "  * Sentence segmentation\n",
    "  * and more ...\n",
    "  \n",
    "## State of the art\n",
    "\n",
    "A decade ago, using raw tokens for NLP tasks was the best we could do. Today, we generally use static or contextual word *embeddings* in place of tokens. We'll talk about this at length in the second half of the course, but the underlying idea is the same. Words and embeddings are proxies for meaning (which is what we ultimately care about, but is never directly accessible to us). Embeddings are just a way to capture more of the specific meaning of a word as it is used in a given language (static) or linguistic context (contextual).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenization can be domain-specific\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that today's reading assumed some special interests:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Twitter(like) texts\n",
    "* Sentiment as target phenomenon\n",
    "\n",
    "So it worked hard to capture Twitter handles, hashtags, smilies, URLs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"right\" way to tokenize depends on your project, on what is meaningful *in context*.\n",
    "If you have different data or different phenomena to investigate, you might tokenize differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: Split on whitespace\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple, naïve approach, workable for quick-and-dirty work with many Western languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cornell is a private, Ivy League university and the land-grant university for New York state.\n",
