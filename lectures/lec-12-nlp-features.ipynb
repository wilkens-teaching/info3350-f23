    "    * In this case, explainability is really important\n",
    "    * We need to understand how our features capture (or fail to capture) the concepts we care about\n",
    "* And sometimes, we want to incorporate **paratextual features**, that is, features that are *about* a book, but aren't *in* the book, strictly speaking\n",

    "    * ***n*-grams** and **noun phrases** capture multi-word sequences like \"best friend\" and \"New York\"\n",

Born English, now a naturalized American, I am the hinge in our harmonious household of three: I sleep with both men, they each sleep only with me.

I’ll never forget the stars piercing the darkness and the shadowy outline of the towering mountains.
