    "    * High-frequency words shared by many documents don't tell us (in many, but not all, cases) much about the similarities or differences between documents\n",
    "* But stopword lists are binary: a word is either a stopword (hence, removed) or it isn't\n",
    "* Can we define a continuous adjustment for \"stoppiness\" that we apply to *every* word, depending on how widely used it is?\n",
    "* One approach is \"term frequency-inverse document frequency\" (TFIDF) weighting. \n",
    "    * You can think of this as multiplying the count of each term in a document by the inverse of the fraction of all documents in which that word occurs (hence \"term frequency [multiplied by] inverse document frequency\"). It's a bit more complicated than that (see below), but that's the idea. This upweights words that occur in relatively few documents.\n",
    "    * The count of a word that occurs in every document would be multiplied by one, hence get no boost in each document. A word that occurs in just one document in a corpus of 100 documents would be multiplied by 100 in the one document that contains it.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Theory 1: Novels generally contain a fixed amount of character space. If a text allocates more space to characters of one type, it must necessarily allocate less space to characters of other types. This is a constraint imposed by what it means to tell a story.\n",
    "2. Theory 2: There is a (wide?) range of amounts of character space that a novel might use. Some novels spend a lot of time talking about their characters; others, very little. If we see a lot of one type of character, we're likely to see a lot of other character types, too.\n",

    "* In both cases, we'll normalize by book length (by dividing the count of each pronoun class by the total number of tokens in the book).\n",
    "* If theory 1 is correct, we'll expect to see fewer `she` pronouns in books that use more `he` pronouns. Ditto `he/they` and `she/they`.\n",
