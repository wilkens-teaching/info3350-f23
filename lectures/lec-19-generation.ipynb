        "\n",
        "In lecture 16, we saw how to **fine-tune** an existing pretrained language model by changing its weights in response to a new task. In contrast, the **zero-shot** paradigm leaves model weights untouched. This makes it much faster than fine-tuning, though zero-shot accuracy is sometimes lower.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the zero-shot paradigm, the main idea is to construct an input to the model and then compare which label is most likely, all without changing model parameters. And since there's no training (i.e. changing model parameters), there's no train/test split. All data is treated as evaluation data here.\n",

        "\n",
        "With zero-shot learning, we can't just feed examples into an LM the way we could with fine-tuning. We need to add additional text to the beginning and/or end of an example because the model's parameters are not being changed. The **prompt** (also called a **template**) is all the extra text that we add around an example in order to get a useful output from an LLM. We'll see several different prompts and prompting strategies below.\n",

Un genio assoluto, oltre alle incredibili capacita linguistiche (aveva imparato autonomamente tantissime lingue) aveva doti matematiche straordinarie tanto da tenere corsi di geometria euclidea ad Harward subito dopo essersi laureato cum laude ad appena 16 anni. La sua storia e veramente affascinante anche se non propriamente edificante, specialmente dal punto di vista umano. Un solo appunto all'autore che usa la tecnica dei continui salti temporali tra il Sidis adulto, adolescente e bambino che, a mio avviso, rende la narrazione troppo spezzettata. Diciamo che la quinta stella se l'e giocata con questo superfluo esercizio di stile piu adatto ad una rappresentazione cinematografica.\n",

That being said, the poems on Side A were sometimes unmemorable, and didn't pack the emotional punch a great poem can give.
