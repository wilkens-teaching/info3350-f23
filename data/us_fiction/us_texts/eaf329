B
CHAP. I.
An old
fashioned
Widow.
It
was about the middle of the fifteenth century
that the lovely and amiable
Isabelle
found
herself
a
widow, reduced from
ease
and affluence to a very
confined
income. Though her
circumstances
were altered;
her mind elevated, her
spirit
noble and independent,
was
still
the
same
.
Isabelle
was a native of Spain, of
noble parentage, expanded heart,
superior
sense
, and
highly
finished
education. The beauty and elegance
of her
person
, though
striking
, were but
secondary
objects
of the
esteem
and admiration
she
was
sure
to
excite
wherever
she
was
seen
or known.
In the prime of life, having
scarcely
reached her
35th year,
suddenly
deprived of a valuable and
beloved
husband
,
she
retired from a court of which
she
had been a principal ornament, to a
castle
romantically
situated
on the borders of Wales.
Amongst
her
husband
's
vast
possessions
, this only had
escaped
the
rapacious hand of his enemies. It was an antique
castle
which formerly had been
designed
for defence,
as well as a habitation; but the
fortress
had been for
many years totally neglected, and the
castle
itself
, in
many places, was fallen to decay. The ground
belonging
to it
consisted
of but a few acres, and
those
few were uncultivated and rude; a few clumps of old
oaks were here and there
scattered
on the
sides
of the
hill, on the
summit
of which the
castle
stood
; and
immediately
surrounding
it, was a
small
patch which once
had been
used
as a kitchen garden. The very trifling
value annexed to this
small
demesne
and its retired
solitary
situation
, made it no object to the enemies of
Arundel; and thither
Isabelle
, with her only child
Columbia, retired.
An old female
servant
, a native of South-America,
whose
name was Cora, and Matthias, a veteran
soldier
who had grown old in the
service
of her
husband
's
father, with a lively little girl particularly attached to
Columbia,
comprised
the whole of her
household
.
Mina was the daughter of a
peasant
in the
neighbourhood
of London. The little Columbia, when
quite a child, walking with her maid on the banks of
the Thames,
saw
Mina gathering
some
dry
sticks
, which
she
carefully tied in a bundle, and, dropping a
curtesy
as Columbia
passed
, cried,
Bless
you,
sweet
little
lady. Mina was
just
nine years of age, her
complexion
clear olive, a
profusion
of jetty hair waved in
glossy
ringlets over her neck, and partly
shaded
her
expressive
countenance; her full black eyes beamed
unutterable
softness
, as taking up her bundle of
sticks
she
gazed
after Columbia, and cried,
Bless
you, my
sweet
little
lady! And
bless
you, my pretty girl,
said
Columbia
;
why do you carry that heavy bundle? 'Tis
wood to make a fire for mammy who is
sick
. Where
does your mammy live? There, in that little
cottage
by the road
side
. Columbia, though not eight
years old,
possessed
a heart glowing with the
strongest
feelings of humanity;
she
darted forward, and in a
moment
was at the door of Mina's cottage. You
must
not go in,
Miss
,
said
the
servant
; if the woman
should
be
sick
of any contagious
disorder
, and you
should
catch
it, what would my lady
say
? What would
she
say
(replied the child) if I
passed
by the
house
without
inquiring what ailed the poor woman? I will go in,
and then I can tell my mother, who will, I am
sure
,
give me
some
money to bring to her to-morrow.
Opposition
was
useless
; the benevolent child entered the
cottage, and beheld a
scene
of
misery
, which, though
she
did not fully comprehend,
she
on her return home
sufficiently
explained to her mother, to obtain
immediate
relief for the poor cottager; and Mina was taken
into
the family and promoted to the honour of waiting
entirely on her little
benefactress
.
When the lady
Isabelle
retired to
Austenbury
Castle
, Columbia was eleven years old. It was her
mother's chief
amusement
to cultivate an
understanding
naturally good, but where
sometimes
the
shoots
of
female
vanity impeded the
progress
of
those
virtues, which
nature with a liberal hand had implanted in her heart.
Remarkably lovely in her
person
,
she
would frequently
decorate her hair with field flowers, at the
same
time
placing garlands of them in
fantastic
drapery about her
dress
; and then, having admired
herself
in the natural
bason
, which ornamented their little garden, fly to her
mother, and exclaim with
transport
, Only
see
how
beautiful! When Mina, who thought her young
mistress
almost
a divinity, would
rapturously
cry, Don't
she
,
my lady, look like an angel?
Isabelle
, though delighted to
observe
the unbounded
vivacity of her daughter, and the grateful affection of
her little dependant, was fully
sensible
of the
necessity
there was for checking
those
ebullitions of vanity,
which, if
suffered
to
pass
unnoticed, would effectually
throw a
shade
over the really valuable qualities of good
sense
, good nature, and benevolence, with which the
soul
of her daughter was amply
stored
. Her
reflections
on this
subject
were often painful in the extreme.
Secluded from the world,
she
had no friend with whom
she
could
advise
. Severity (
she
would
say
within
herself
)
will but teach my child to
consider
me as a frigid
monitress
, her heart will contract and hide its thoughts
from an eye that beams only with reproach! No; I
must
watch the favourable moment, and effectually
eradicate this error, by convincing her
understanding
of its folly. I would be the guardian of my child's
morals; I would be her friend, and direct her in the
way
most
likely to
secure
her
present
and future
happiness
;
but for the
universe
I would not forfeit the
exquisite
pleasure
of participating every thought, every
wish
of her innocent heart.No; let me not, by ill timed
harshness
, drive her
guileless
and
unsuspecting
nature
to mean
subterfuge
and artifice; had
she
a
thousand
errors,
she
is
still
my child, and though it is my duty
to correct, it is
also
my duty to conceal and palliate
faults, which reflection tells me, are but the offspring
of human nature.
It was ever the care of
Isabelle
to
impress
on the
mind of her daughter a proper
sense
of a
wise
,
benignant
,
overruling Power; to whom
she
was indebted
for her being, and to whom
she
was accountable for
her words and actions; but this was done more by
example
than precept. Calumny was a
stranger
to her
lips; to perform every good work of peace and mercy
was the delight of her heart. She
worshipped
her
Creator with
sincerity
and fervor; no appointed hour,
no
set
form of prayer; every
blessing
was received
with
thankfulness
, every correction
submitted
to with
patience.
Amongst
the
most
heinous offences
she
reckoned
the
misuse
or neglect of time, and the total
abuse
or
perversion
of God's good gifts. Every hour of her
life was
usefully
employed, and
she
dealt by every
human
being, as
she
wished
them to deal by her.
It was a fine evening in the middle of September,
when Columbia
asked
her mother to partake of
some
fruit in a neat arbour Matthias had
dressed
by the
side
of the pond. You forget, my dear mother, (
said
she
)
that this is the day I always devote to joy and
playfulness
.
This is the day on which you relieved poor
Mina's mother, and brought that good girl home to
live with me; and
she
has been
so
affectionate,
so
grateful
,
that to-day I am determined
she
shall
be queen of
the
feast
. You do not know how charming it will be!
Matthias has got us
some
peaches, and Cora has
provided
cream, with baked apples and wheat cakes; and
whilst
you
refresh
yourself
, Mina and I will
sing
and
dance to divert you.
Isabelle
clasped
the
interesting
child in her arms, and repaired to the appointed
scene
of infantile
festivity
.
After the collation was over, at which Mina was
made to
preside
, Columbia told her mother, that
she
could never repay the
pleasure
her
first
acquaintance
with that little girl had given her; For,
said
she
,
B 2
before I
saw
her
distress
, and you, my beloved
mother
,
gave me the means to relieve it, I had no idea of
happiness
beyond
myself
; but that
blessed
day taught
me, that to confer
happiness
on another, gave the
mind
sensations
a
thousand
times more
exquisite
than
any other enjoyment the world affords. She then,
with the
swiftness
and light bound of an antelope,
sprang
from her mother's embrace, and ran toward
the
castle
; but
soon
returned with Mina, decorated in
all the finery they could put together. The jetty hair
of Mina hung
loose
and unadorned about her neck and
shoulders
,
whilst
her little white jacket and petticoat
were richly ornamented with orange lilies, poppies and
blue iris.
The fine auburn
tresses
of Columbia were bound up
with a garland of corn flowers, and autumnal
daisies
,
whose
glowing tints vied with the colour,
whilst
the
consciousness
of their becoming effect gave an
additional
brilliancy to her eyes. Her
dress
, which was
composed
of light grey
satin
,
she
had lightly and
elegantly
ornamented with
festoons
of oak leaves,
whose
dark native green was at this period of the year
enlivened
by the bright yellow, and glowing
scarlet
hue,
they had caught from the chilly breath of autumn.
Light as the
gossamer
they bound over the turf,
dancing
to the notes of their own harmonious voices. The
evening was
serene
; the glowing
sun
just
touched with
his broad
disk
the
western
ocean,
whilst
as he
sunk
beneath
the
shades
of night, the moon, emerging from
her watry bed, reflected his departing beams, and
tinged the cold
eastern
sky
with
saffron
hue,
whilst
here
and there a
scattered
cloud, dark in
itself
, caught her
pale rays, and brightened by degrees to high-wrought
silver
.
Fatigued with the
exercise
of dancing, Columbia
paused
upon the margin of the
stream
; its
surface
was
smooth
and even as the
polished
mirror;her elegant
form, becoming
dress
, and angel countenance were
reflected
in the water. She
stopped
and gazed. A beam
of exultation
shot
from her eyes. It was the moment
Isabelle
had
so
long
wished
for.
And what does my child
so
intently gaze at?
(
said
she
, approaching her daughter.)
Mina
stood
at a little
distance
; her own beauty was
to
herself
unknown, her whole
soul
was wrapt in
admiring
the beauty of her young lady. When the lady
Isabelle
spoke
,
she
drew near and
listened
with
attention
.
She loved her with grateful affection, and
instruction
from her lips
sunk
directly to her heart.
And what does my child
so
intently gaze at?
said
Isabelle
, is it the lovely form with which
nature
has bountifully endowed her; and which the
unruffled
surface
of the water
so
beautifully reflects to her
admiring eyes? Alas, my child, if that is the object of
your admiration, how fragile is the
pleasure
you
receive
!
What is it you contemplate? A
shadow
; nay,
less
than a
shadow
; for beauty
itself
is but a
shadow
,
scarce
seen
before it is gone; and that fair
semblance
you there behold is but the
shadow
of a
shade
.
Behold
,
my child, continued
she
, throwing
something
into the water,
see
that beauteous figure, how
deformed
,
how
disgusting
; every trait of
loveliness
is
gone. Columbia turned from the
stream
with an
involuntary
shudder
.
Isabelle
continuedOr
see
, my
love,
these
flowers, with which but a few hours
since
you decorated your hair; they were then
fresh-blooming
and beautiful beyond
description
; behold them
now! their
sweets
are all exhaled, their vivid tints are
flown, and no longer valuable, you would throw them
from you with neglect and abhorrence. Even
so
, my
dear Columbia, is it with the frail beauty which you
so
ardently admire. One breath from the creative
Power that gave you being, might level you with the
dust
.
Sickness
, misfortune, poverty, might deprive
your eyes of their
lustre
, your
skin
of its
glossy
hue,
and
steal
the luxuriant
tresses
from your head. Nay,
even at this moment, the cold hand of death might
sink
you into nothing; and
those
who to-day looked at
you with admiration, would to-morrow turn from you
with
disgust
and terror. Like
these
poor flowers you
would be thrown upon the earth, be trod under foot
and forgotten.
Mina, dropping her garland on the ground,
seized
her young lady by the arm, as though
she
would
save
her from
so
disgraceful
an end. Columbia looked at
her with affection, gently freed
herself
from her
grasp
,
and, looking at the faded flowers, with eyes
streaming
with tears
asked
her mother, Am I, then, of no more
consequence
than
these
flowers, and may I be as
easily
destroyed
? Shall I be as
soon
reduced to nothing?
No, my beloved girl, (
said
Isabelle
) you are of a
thousand
times more value than the
fairest
flower that
ever bloomed, or the
richest
gem that ever decked the
brow of royalty. Look round, my love, behold this
vast
, this glorious
universe
; what beauty, what order!
How does the mind expand with wonder and delight
as we contemplate the fields of ripened grain, the
loaded
fruit trees, verdant plains and
majestic
mountains,
whose
summits
seem
to
kiss
the face of heaven.
Observe
how grand, how
strikingly
sublime
, appears the
orb of day,
just
sinking
in the
western
sky
, which flames
with
crimson
,
burnished
gold and purple; and
see
, as
he retires, the placid moon
assumes
her
silent
reign,
whilst
millions of
stars
compose
her
splendid
train, and
glitter in the
vast
expanse
of ether. Stupendous, great
and wonderful as
these
appear, believe me, my child,
one pure, virtuous human
soul
is of more value in the
sight
of the Creator, than all that you behold. They
shall
fade away,
shall
vanish
as a dream, and be no
more remembered; but the
soul
,
studious
to perform
its duty, beneficent to its fellow creatures, and glowing
with grateful, humble affection to the great
First
Cause
of all,
shall
stand
secure
amid the general ruin, and
rise
triumphant from a
sinking
world.
Thus did
Isabelle
endeavour to
inspire
her daughter
with a thorough contempt for all frivolous
pursuits
, and
to give her a
just
sense
of the value of mental
acquirements
.
From this time
she
fully comprehended of
how much more
consequence
was the
embellishing
of
the mind, than the trifling decorations of the
person
.
Besides
, having been informed of the
immortality
of the
soul
,
she
was anxious in inquiry for the means
by which
so
invaluable a
blessing
might be
preserved
;
and to hint to her the danger of forfeiting
so
great a
privilege, was always
sufficient
to deter her from any
thing that was wrong.
It cannot be imagined that a woman like
Isabelle
could
pass
at once from the court to the cottage, and
be
suffered
to glide unnoticed into
obscurity
.
Amongst
the friends and intimates of her days of
splendor
, were
some
, tenderly attached to her from principle, and
others
,
whom the united beauties of her mind and
person
had
inspired
with a
wish
, to lead her again to the altar
of Hymen. But
Isabelle
had drank too deeply of the
bitter cup of affliction to
suffer
love ever again to enter
her
bosom
. Faithful to the memory of her regretted
lord, her heart could receive no
second
impression
.
Our love,
she
would
say
, was unfortunate, but he
has left me an
inestimable
pledge behind;
shall
I give
the daughter of my adored Arundel another father, or
by extending my family duties have
less
time to
bestow
in rendering my child worthy of the name
she
bears?
No; the
sincerest
proof I can give of my affection to
her father, is to live a widow for her
sake
.
This
resolve
of
Isabelle
being once known, and
she
still
persisting
in
secluding
herself
from the world,
she
was
soon
forgotten,
almost
as much as if
she
had been
dead; for love cannot long
exist
without hope, and
the gay and
thoughtless
soon
forget
those
on whom
the
sun
of
prosperity
no longer
shines
. She was left
in peace to enjoy her retirement, and to cultivate
unmolested
the mind of her lovely daughter.
CHAP. II.
The Dangers of
Greatness
.
As
Columbia
increased
in years, her affection for
her mother daily
strengthened
. It was an
affection
actuated by the
enthusiastic
fervor of youth, yet
sweetly
tempered by a
friendship
which might have
become
maturer years.
Isabelle
was to her daughter,
mother,
sister
, friend; every tender connexion combined
in one. Never did child more love or fear a parent; yet
her fear did not proceed from the
apprehension
of
punishment
or
severe
correction. But to
see
her mother
frown, to be told
she
had offended her, and to be
spoken
to with
coldness
, gave her
such
inexpressible
anguish
,
that the thought at any time was
sufficient
to
fill her eyes with tears.
As
she
advanced towards womanhood,
she
could not
but
observe
the extreme
pensiveness
of her mother's
disposition
; the
pursuits
and
pleasures
of childhood
gradually
lost
their charms,
she
more frequently
sought
the
society
of
Isabelle
, and when
sometimes
she
surprised
her in tears,
she
would
sink
on her knees before her,
and, folding her arms round her
waist
, cry, Why, my
beloved mother, will you confine your
sorrows
to your
own
breast
, why not
repose
them in the
bosom
of your
child? Let me
share
them, my mother, and in
sharing
soothe
them.
Isabelle
would faintly
smile
at
these
effusions
of her daughter's
tenderness
, and as
she
kissed
the affectionate girl tell her, it was too early in life for
her to be acquainted with
sorrow
, though
she
could
feel it only from the
tenderness
of her nature, leading
her to
compassionate
the
sufferings
of others.
I am not
so
happy as I formerly was, my dear
Mina,
said
Columbia to her attendant one evening as
they were walking in the garden; I
see
my mother
daily
sinking
under the weight of afflictions I can
neither
comprehend or alleviate.
Yesterday
I tremblingly
asked
her, if I was the
cause
of her
sorrow
;
she
pressed
me to her heart and
said
, in
some
measure
I was.
Alarmed, I inquired what I had done to offend her.
Nothing,
she
replied; you are my only comfort, my
greatest
blessing
, and I cannot but lamentHer tears
at that moment impeded her words, and when
she
recovered
her voice,
she
bade me leave her. I obeyed;
but
still
I have a weight upon my heart, an anxious,
restless
wish
to know, how without offending I can
cause
her
so
much affliction.
Mina could not
satisfy
her young lady's
curiosity
:
she
could only
kiss
her hands, and in a voice rendered
exquisitely
soft
by grateful affection, declare it was
impossible
her dear little
benefactress
could offend any
one!
But though Mina was ignorant of the
cause
of
Isabelle's
tears, Cora, the Indian
servant
, was not equally
so
. She
saw
Columbia partook of her mother's
depression
,
without
understanding
the
cause
; and the
loquacity
naturally prevalent in
persons
of an advanced age,
made her eagerly watch for an opportunity to inform
the innocent girl of all
she
knew. The moment long
sought
at length arrived. Columbia had frequently
observed
her mother weeping over papers which
she
took
from a private drawer in an
escritoire
which
stood
in
her bed chamber, and which in no other part was
locked
,
except that which
she
most
wished
to explore. One
day coming
suddenly
into the room,
she
saw
her gazing
at a portrait which
she
pressed
to her lips,
raising
her
eyes toward heaven with a
sort
of reverential awe.
May I not, my dear mother,
said
she
, behold the
object that
seems
at once to excite both grief and
exultation
.
Isabelle
turned the portrait towards her; it was
an Indian maid habited in the manner of her country;
but in habiliments that
bespoke
her of elevated rank.
Her jetty hair, which flowed in
profusion
round her
face and over her neck, was ornamented with a coronet
of pearl and gold; her thin white robe was
clasped
at
the
bosom
with
studs
of the
same
valuable materials,
and her arms, which were naked to the
shoulders
, were
in
several
places bound with bands of
silver
and coral.
This,
said
Isabelle
, as
she
presented
it to her
daughter
,
is the portrait of your grandmother; by birth a
queen
, the only child of a monarch
whose
wealth had
no bounds, and who, far from the haunts of
those
who
call
themselves
civilized people, reigned
unmolested
, till
the adventurous
spirit
of your great
ancestor
Columbus
prompted him to
seekin
distant
seas
for unknown worlds.
Oh,
sublime
and too daring
spirit
,
she
continued,
whilst
her
raised
eyes
glistened
with the tear of extorted
remembrance
,
why wert thou endowed with qualities,
which
served
but to
stir
up in the
breasts
of thine enemies
the malignant fiend Envy. Why!
whilst
thou wert
labouring
to benefit and enlighten
posterity
, wert thou
sealing
thy own ruin!
The portrait dropped from her hand, and her head
rested
on the
shoulder
of her child. Oh! my
daughter
,
cried
she
enthusiastically
, as her tears
subsided
,
whilst
I glory in the qualities with which it has
pleased
Heaven to endow your mind and
person
, I cannot but
tremble for your future fate; for to
possess
superior
beauty,
sense
or genius, is but to excite the wonder of
the ignorant, and the envy of little minds,
whilst
those
who are
wise
, or great in their own conceit, will wound
your feelings with contempt or ridicule, which your
own good nature and
sensibility
will not permit you to
retaliate. I cannot proceed, my child; my powers
are not at
present
adequate to the
task
of recounting the
misfortunes of your family.
Isabelle
paused
for a
moment
,
then tenderly
kissed
Columbia, and leaving the
portrait in the hands of her child,
passed
from the
apartment
.
Sinking upon the
seat
her mother had left
unoccupied
,
one hand
supporting
her head as her elbow
rested
on
the
escritoire
, the other which held the portrait fell on
her knees, her eyes immoveably fixed on
those
of the
inanimate face
she
contemplated, Columbia
sat
immoveable
as a
statue
, till
roused
by the voice of Cora.
Look there,
said
she
, putting the miniature towards
the aged
servant
;
see
! my mother
says
it is the
picture
of my grandmother. It is, it is, cried Cora,
dropping on her knees and
kissing
the picture with
rapture
;
it is the figure of my queen, my
mistress
, in the
dress
she
wore on the day
she
was
espoused
by Don
Ferdinando. Oh fatal day! unhappy hour! by that
union
she
sealed
her own
wretchedness
, the ruin of her
father, the
slavery
of his people, and brought
destruction
on the heads of her adored
husband
and his
respected
parent! Ah! my
sweet
young
mistress
, I can no
longer forbear; I
must
tell you the fatal
story
of your
father's wrongs.
Do
so
,
said
Isabelle
, who at that moment returned
to her apartment; do
so
, my good Cora; and let it be a
warning to my child how
she
quits the quiet paths of
retirement to enter on the gay or
busy
scenes
of life.
Here, take this key; what your memory cannot
furnish
toward the recital, the papers you will
sind
in that
drawer will
assist
.
Listen
with attention, my dear child,
and learn that content builds her dwelling in
solitude
,
and peace
spreads
her pinions over the cottage of the
humble;
whilst
the paths of ambition are
strewed
with
thorns, and the dwellings of the great are the
habitations
of
misery
.
CHAP. III.
An Old Woman's Tale interrupted.
It
is many years ago,
said
Cora,
seating
herself
in an
easy
chair, her right hand
spread
out, as
commanding attention, and every feature of her aged
countenance beaming with the
satisfaction
which the
liberty of repeating tales of old times gave her; it
is a great many years ago, I was then
scarcely
eight
years old, when your great-grandfather Columbus
arrived
in our country; I never
shall
forget it: for I can
remember things which happened when I was a child
much better than
those
which
pass
now daily. Time
steals
away our memory, but
those
things which either
frightened, or
surprised
us when we were young, are
the
last
which we forget. So as I was
saying
Stay, my good Cora,
said
Columbia, let us
examine
the papers; there may be letters which may
serve
to
elucidate your relation, and explain events which
happened
antecedent to the time of your remembrance.
I do not think you will find any worth reading,
said
Cora, impatiently. We will
see
, replied Columbia,
mildly, as
she
opened the drawer. You may look,
cried Cora
somewhat
pettishly
, but I am
sure
there is
nothing worth attending to, till the time of Don
Ferdinando's
arrival in Peru and becoming enamoured of my
royal
mistress
Orrabella.
Hush
,
hush
, my kind friend,
said
Columbia. Here is a letter
signed
Columbus;
C
there are
several
in the
same
hand writing; they
must
contain facts
necessary
for me to know, or they would
not be thus carefully
preserved
. Be
silent
, and I will
read them to you. Cora
sat
herself
back in the
easy
chair, and
shutting
her eyes in token of attention,
remained
silent
. Columbia opened the letter.
Columbus to Beatina.
October, 1490.
I AM parted from you, my adored Beatina; but
painful as the parting is, I feel it is for our
suture
advantage
.
I am convinced, my beloved wife, that there are
worlds beyond the narrow bounds which our natural
philosophers
at
present
prescribe
. I have
studied
much,
my lovely friend, and am
almost
certain, that were I
supplied
with
vessels
, men,
provisions
, and every thing
necessary
, I
should
make
discoveries
that would
occasion
my name to be revered in after ages; and
those
who blamed my lovely Beatina for giving
herself
to her
Columbus,
shall
say
, You did right, Beatina;
Columbus
has an
enterprising
spirit
that will carve out a
fortune, even from a barren
waste
. For is not the
ocean a barren
waste
? and yet even from that do I
mean to carve out for my
soul
's idol an empire, where
she
shall
reign queen over all, as
she
does over my
heart.
Why, why, my
best
beloved, are you not endowed
with
strength
of frame, that your
friendship
might
increase
my fortitude in danger, and
share
the glorious
triumph of unexpected
success
? Yet why
should
I
wish
you to
lose
the
sweet
feminine
softness
which
first
won, and
still
holds captive my heart? I know not
what I
wish
, Beatina. You
so
entirely
possess
my
thoughts, that
whilst
I
search
this
vast
globe for
unknown
worlds, to lay them at your feet when found, I
would have the fame, the glory of the
discovery
all
your own. And will it not be yours? Yes!
surely
yes; for you
inspired
the thought, prompted the
search
, and are the magic charm that actuates all my
endeavours.
Tell our dear Ferdinando, that though I have by
my marriage with his mother deprived him of his
birthright as the only heir of an ancient and wealthy
marquis, I will toil to
recompense
to him the
sacrifice
his dear mother made to me. Sweet Beatina, do not
grieve at this our long
separation
; when I return, I
will return worthy of your love; I will make my
charmer
worshipped
by
those
who now hold her in
contempt. I am about to lay before the king of
Portugal a plan for making
those
discoveries
, you have
so
frequently heard me mention as more than
probable
.
If he
listens
to me, my fortune is certain; if he
treats my
proposals
as chimerical, the offspring of a
disordered
imagination, I will apply to
some
other
power.
Dearest
, have courage; the
persevering
spirit
must
in time conquer. Believe I but
exist
,
whilst
abfent
from you, and think that
existence
scarcely
worth
preserving
but for your
sake
. Heaven
bless
my
Beatina
.
C. COLUMBUS.
That letter was written before my remembrance,
said
Cora. Very likely, replied Columbia,
scarcely
noticing the date, in her
eagerness
to open another.
Columbus to Beatina.
January, 1491.
I HAVE been
disappointed
, my
sweet
friend, but
be not you
disheartened
. Thanks be to Heaven, I left
you and my darling boy in a
safe
retreat, where,
though not enjoying all the advantages your rank in
life might demand, you have at
least
all the comforts
necessary
to the real pleasures of life.
But think not, my beloved, my
esteemed
friend, I
would wander forth in
search
of adventures, and leave
the wife of my choice and the offspring of her affection
to
languish
out many years, nay, perhaps their whole
lives, in
obscurity
. No! no! Columbus labours not
for his own advantage, but for the advantage of
those
so
nearly,
so
dearly connected with him. I will leave
you, my love, whenever I quit my native land, in a
state
of honour and opulence, or my
scheme
shall
be
totally abandoned.
If I fail, if in this (generally thought) romantic
plan I
lose
my life, your father will no doubt be
reconciled
to you, nor
slight
the offspring of an only
child, on account of his affinity to an unfortunate man,
who, had he been monarch of the globe, would have
laid his crown at Beatina's feet.
I leave my native land to-morrow, in order to
solicit
Ferdinand of Spain to grant me the
vessels
and
supplies
necessary
for
prosecuting
my intended voyage. I am
told the court of Spain is more enlightened than any
other court in Europe.
I had, previous to my quitting you, found means to
lay my plans before the
British
throne; but I fear they
were treated as the project of a
visionary
; for though
my brother undertook the charge, I have received no
answer
. Alas! Beatina, how hard it is to combat
any received prejudice. The
wise
and learned men
of
past
ages have held it
impossible
for mariners to find
a
passage
, or proceed, without incurring immediate
death, beyond certain boundaries which their confined
knowledge has marked out. But I will not be
withheld
from the experiment. If I
succeed
, after ages
will revere my name; if I fail, it will
sink
quietly into
oblivion; or perhaps
some
future genius,
enterprising
and
sanguine
as
myself
,
shall
drop a tear to my
memory
,
and as he laments my fate, tremble for his own.
Adieu, my friend, my lovely comforter. I am more
yours than my own.
C. COLUMBUS.
After this,
several
letters were
perused
by Columbia,
which contained little more than a repetition of his
attachment
to Beatina, and accounts of his
unsuccessful
applications to Ferdinand, the then reigning king of
Spain. At length the following called up all her
attention.
Columbus to Beatina.
May, 1492.
CONGRATULATE me, my lovely friend; I am
at length
successful
! How have I counted the tedious
months that kept me from my
soul
's idol; and how
often have I feared that my
perseverance
would be of
no avail, and that I had
sacrificed
ages of real
happiness
(for hours are ages to the heart that loves as mine
does) to the
visionary
hopes of future
greatness
. But
I am
successful
. I
shall
explore
those
distant
seas
, with
which my
studies
have
so
well acquainted me, and in
some
unknown world
seek
out a kingdom of which my
Beatina
shall
be queen. Yes, you
shall
be queen; for
whatsoever
world I find, be it the
fairest
,
greatest
, or the
best
the
sun
ever
shone
on, no man
should
ever claim a
right to govern it. For it is to a woman I owe the
means of making the great attempt. I am
so
overjoyed
I cannot proceed methodically; yet I know you
languish
to learn every particular that concerns your
Columbus.
I have in former letters informed you of my hitherto
fruitless
solicitations
. Wearied by attendance on
ministers
and creatures, who hung about the king like bees
upon the
sweet
scabious
, draining it of its vital
moisture
till its very root decayed, when they returned to their
hives laden with the precious
store
,
regardless
of the
dying
state
of the flower from which they had extracted
both life and health;
disgusted
with their unmeaning
professions
, their
hypocrisy
and
stupidity
, I had nearly
relinquished
the undertaking, when I one morning
received
an order to attend the queen's private drawing
room. You may
suppose
I did not
hesitate
to obey the
summons
. The royal
Isabelle
received me with
affability
and encouraging
sweetness
;
she
condescended
to
confer with me on my intended voyage, and on the
studies
which led me to hope for
success
. She
listened
with attention to my
reasons
, and bade me attend
the levee next morning. I went. My royal
patroness
urged my
suit
to the king with all the
earnestness
of
persuasive
eloquence. He
listened
; but it was with
cold,
almost
contemptuous
silence
. Yet was
she
not
dismayed
; her fine features glowed with
enthusiasm
, as
she
expressed
a prophetic
assurance
of
success
. Her
intercessions
were
finished
with this heroic declaration:
If your
majesty
,
said
she
, conceives the plan too
wild, too eccentric to be countenanced, by ordering this
enterprising
man the
necessary
supplies
from the public
C 2
treasury
; and if your own private
purse
will not at
present
allow of
so
large a
disbursement
,
suffer
me to
raise
the money on my own
personal
jewels. I
beseech
your
majesty
do not
say
me nay. I want no ornaments
to render me
pleasing
to my
sovereign
, and will
cheerfully
part with them, to benefit his
subjects
, or add to
his territories.
Struck with the magnanimity of the
proposal
,
Ferdinand
could no longer
refuse
; he gave immediate
orders
for the equipment of a fleet, in which I am to
proceed
on my intended
discovery
; and a
sum
of money
is to be paid to me from the
treasury
, to provide every
necessary
for the voyage.
I fell at the feet of the royal
Isabelle
, and
kissed
, with
grateful
transports
, the hem of her garment. She
graciously
raised
me, and with a
smile
of heavenly
benignity
assured
me, that you, my Beatina, and our
darling
Ferdinando,
should
be taken under her immediate
protection.
Hasten
then, my
dearest
, on the receipt of
this;
hasten
to Spain, and let me introduce you to our
august
queen. I know you will partake my joy; and
if a tear does
start
at the thought of parting, I
also
know you will wipe it off
unseen
,
lest
it
should
unman
the heart of your adoring
COLUMBUS.
Undaunted
spirit
of my
ancestor
, cried
Columbia
,
as
she
closed
the letter, may you ever inhabit the
bosoms
of his
descendants
. But what is the next
letter?
said
Cora. She opened it, but it was only a
farewel to Beatina, when he was ready to
sail
from
Cadiz; and by it Columbia
disovered
that lady and
her
son
were retained in the
Spanish
court under the
immediate
protection of
Isabelle
. The next was a large
packet, and of
such
a nature as could not be
hastily
or
slightly
passed
over.
Isabelle, queen of Spain, to Beatina, wife to
Columbus.
February, 1493.
THOU
besom
friend of the
bravest
man that ever
lived, thy queen now claims thee as her friend and
sister
.
Isabelle
is in affliction, and calls on Beatina to
comfort her. Yet how can I
ask
comfort from you,
when I have none to offer in return? I cannot
see
you,
lest
you
curse
the hand that
supplied
the means
for this ill-
starred
voyage. Our Columbus, the man
whose
name
shall
be revered while time endures, is no
more! He
sleeps
in the
vast
ocean; but his memory
shall
live forever.
Did I
say
I had no comfort to offer? Alas! my
regrets for his
loss
were
so
great, I forgot that he
triumphed
ere he died. He found the wondrous
unknown
world he
sought
; but his own words will
best
tell his
success
. The
inclosed
was brought to our
court this morning by a
sea
captain, who,
whilst
yet
far from the
Spanish
coast
,
saw
something
floating on
the waves; and feeling an awakened
curiosity
prompt
him, went a little out of his
course
to take it up. It
was a
cask
painted white. On opening it, they
found this
sad
testimony
of our fatal
loss
,
inclosed
in a cake of wax, and
surrounded
by a quantity of
cork, in order, as is imagined, to facilitate its
swimming
.
I am inadequate to the
task
of adding more;
only to
say
, when you can
see
me without
distress
to
yourself
, come to me, and let us mingle our tears
together
.
Bring Ferdinando with you; henceforth he
is my
son
. Farewel.
ISABELLE.
Inclosed
in the foregoing.
Columbus to his royal Mistress.
At
sea
,
December, 1492.
Royal and revered Lady
,
THE
most
humble and grateful of your fervants
addresses
you at a moment, when he much fears he
shall
never again behold you. I am, with my little
convoy, in a
boisterous
and
almost
unknown
sea
, at a
season
of the year when
storms
prevail, and the
inclemency
of the weather renders our
safety
extremely
precarious. The clouds hang low; the
atmosphere
is
thick; the hollow murmuring
sea
, and bleak wind
that
whistles
through the rigging, portends an
approaching
storm
.
I
shall
not fulfil my duty to the
most
gracious of
sovereigns
, if I do not try
some
method to inform her,
whatever may be my fate, her
wishes
are fulfilled.
The new, the hitherto unexplored world, of which I
fondly dreamed
so
many anxious years, is at length
discovered
! I
shall
annex to this the
course
by which
I
steered
, the
soundings
as we approached the land,
and every
requisite
direction for mariners to find the
place where I have left a little colony of forty men.
Our voyage from Spain was tedious in the extreme,
and
those
who had not the
same
internal
assurances
,
which my
intense
study
had given me, of our being in
a right
course
, were
almost
tempted to mutiny, to
confine me, and, taking command of the fleet, return
to Spain; but to my
inexpressible
joy, when even my
own
spirits
began to fail, nor could I longer have
silenced
the fears of the mariners, on the morning of
the 12th of October, I
discovered
land. We made
for the
shore
, and on the 13th landed and took
possession
of a beautiful fertile
island
, in the name of your
august
consort
Ferdinand. I
kissed
the ground as I
landed, and called it St. Salvadora, in honour of my
gracious
patroness
; for her bounty relieved me when
I was in utter
despair
of ever making the attempt of
a
discovery
, and the
sight
of this
island
preserved
me
from the vengeance of a
disappointed
, terrified
set
of
seamen
, who thought I had
foolishly
dragged them
from their friends and country to
perish
on the ocean.
I found the inhabitants humane,
social
, and tractable;
and left our little colony in a
state
of greater comfort
than could have been expected. But the
impossibility
of obtaining proper
provisions
for the long voyage
before
us, and the very fragile
state
of our barques to
combat
seas
unusually
tempestuous
at this
season
,
renders
me fearful I
shall
never again
see
Spain, or kneel
at the feet of my royal
mistress
.
The
island
I have
discovered
yields plenty of gold
dust
; pearls are found in the rivers; and from what I
could
observe
, diamonds and other precious
stones
are
easily
procured. For the natives not only wear them
in their hair and about their necks, but decorate their
temples with them, intermixed with gold and
silver
.
These
temples are in general dedicated to the
Sun
,
which is their chief object of adoration. The
sacred
duties are performed by
priestesses
, who vow eternal
virginity. Their men are tall and well proportioned;
the women beautiful in the extreme.
Thus have I
slightly
touched on the many charms
to entice my
sovereign
to make this territory her own.
Oh may the wealth its mines contain, enrich her
above all her cotemporaries; may the colony
she
plants
increase
and
flourish
; there may
she
found a
new, a glorious world, that after ages
shall
at once
admire
and fear.
And now that life perhaps is near its
close
, will my
benignant queen permit her
servant
to recommend
once more to her protection, my wife and child?
Ferdinando
is now fifteen. When he attains the age of
manhood, let him
pursue
the path I have marked out,
and
finish
what his father but begun; and
should
his
searches
meet with the
success
my
spirit
prophesies
, let
the new world be called
Columbia
. It will unite the
name of Beatina with Columbus, perpetuating her
loved
name with mine.
I would have wrote to my beloved wife, but what
could I
say
? My heart bleeds for what
she
will
suffer
.
You, my gracious
mistress
, will not
forsake
her.
Comfort
her,
console
her; tell her that Beatina will be the
last
sound
that trembles on my lips. Pardon me,
sovereign
lady, my
style
grows familiar; but the grave
levels all
distinctions
, and I am now
standing
on its
brink. A few more hours, and I plunge into a
vast
eternity! If the
storm
increases
, my
vessel
cannot much
longer brave its fury; if mine cannot, what will
become
of the poor little caravels that accompany me?
Their fate is certain! Royal
Isabelle
, farewel. While
life lingers in this frail tenement, gratitude for thy
munificence can never be extinct in the heart of thy
servant
,
COLUMBUS.
Noble, brave commander, cried Columbia, giving
way to a flood of tears; and was this thy untimely
end? No, no,
said
Cora interrupting her; he made
several
voyages after that, or
elseshow
should
he carry
Don Ferdinando to Peru? He did not die till after the
birth of
Christopher
and a
sister
of your mother, who was
christened
Isabelle
, after the queen of Spain. He lived
to a good old age, and was hearty and well till
misfortune
overtook him; then he moped and pined; nay,
I have
seen
him weep like a baby, and he died at
last
broken hearted. More
shame
for
those
who could
wound a heart
so
noble,
said
Columbia,
whilst
resentment
,
as it
crimsoned
her cheek, dried up her tears; and
she
proceeded to the next letter. It contained an
account
of Columbus's
safe
return. After having
encountered
innumerable perils, he landed at Palos, in Spain,
on the 15th of March, 1493. After which,
several
other letters announce another voyage, in which he was
more
successful
than the
first
, returning laden with
ingots
of gold, with pearls, with diamonds, and
immense
plates of
silver
.
But his
success
and the homage the populace
seemed
inclined to pay him, awakened a
spirit
of envy in
those
who had at
first
opposed
, or treated as the chimeras of
a
disordered
fancy, his plans for the
discovery
of a
distant
continent. They had not time to bring their
plots to ripen, before he again embarked for America,
with a large company of volunteers, gentlemen of the
first
rank in Spain;
amongst
which was his own
son
,
Don Ferdinando. A farewel letter from this young
gentleman to his mother, was the
first
that awakened
Cora's attention. It was dated in June, 1498. That
was the time,
said
she
, that was the very voyage, which
I
so
well remember. Were you eight years old then,
Cora?
said
Columbia. Yes, I was indeed, replied
Cora, but I remember every
circumstance
, as well as
if it had
passed
but
yesterday
! Then do tell me, dear
Cora,
said
Columbia, tell me all; for in
listening
to the recital of a
person
who was
present
whilst
the
events they relate happened, it
seems
as if you were
transported
to the very
scene
, and
witness
to the
incidents
recited.
CHAP. IV.
New Scenes, new Men, new Manners.
It
was on the
first
of
August
,
said
Cora,
drawing
herself
forward,
whilst
memory
seemed
upon
the
stretch
to recal events
so
long
past
; it was, as near as
I can recollect, about the beginning of
August
, when my
mother, who was chief attendant about the royal
children
of Orrozombo, king of Peru, was ordered to
attend
the queen and her children to a palace newly built
on the
sea
coast
, a great
distance
from the capital. I
shall
never forget it; it was as fine a morning as ever
shone
.
The
princess
Orrabella was the
oldest
of five daughters;
for my royal
master
never had a
son
, and
she
was
looked
upon as our future queen. I was then, as I told
you, but eight years old, quite delighted with our new
habitation. I followed the
princess
, with whom I was
a great favourite, from one apartment to another, till
we reached the top. There, as we
stood
looking
toward
the
sea
, we
saw
a
monstrous
fish
or bird, for it
was
impossible
to tell which it was; its body was black,
its wings white; it was coming quick toward the
shore
.
The
princess
shrieked
. The king and queen had, from
a lower apartment,
observed
the
same
monster
hastily
approaching; and ordering forth the guards, bade them
draw up on the beach, and as it drew near
discharge
their arrows at it. But, Oh terrible, if I was to live a
thousand
years, I never
shall
forget how frightened
every
creature was, when the huge
monster
, drawing quite
near,
stopped
on a
sudden
, and dropping all its wings,
a
burst
of fire and
smoke
issued
from its
side
, with
tremendous
noise
. Many fell to the earth with terror, as
this dreadful phenomena was repeated three times.
When our fears were in
some
measure
abated, we
plainly
saw
living creatures move upon it, and
soon
a
smaller
fish
of the
same
kind, only without wings,
came from its
side
, and
several
men were borne by it
quite to the
shore
. The guards affrighted, dared not
discharge
their arrows, but let their bows fall, and
gazed
in
silent
wonder. The king, the queen, and all the
royal children were
standing
on the
shore
. The
princess
Orrabella was ever brave and undaunted;
she
stood
leaning on my mother's arm, the
foremost
of them all.
I had hid my face in her robe; but though afraid to look
long on the terrifying object, I now and then drew it
aside
to peep at a creature
so
wonderful.
But, my good Cora, cried Columbia, rather
impatient
at the old woman's prolixity, if you are thus
particular, you will never get to the end of your
story
.
This
monster
, as you
describe
it, I
suppose
was the
ship
that bore the great Columbus to the Peruvian
coast
;
and the little
fish
you mention was the boat in which he
landed.
Well, I know that, replied Cora, angrily; but
I like to tell a
story
my own way. If I am not
allowed
to tell all the particulars, I
shall
never be able to
tell it at all. Columbia
smiled
and was
silent
.
Cora again began, but
she
so
often interrupted
herself
telling the
same
incidents
several
times over, and
dwelling
on each with a
tiresome
minuteness
, that Columbia,
though anxious, could
scarcely
command her
attention
to the end of the
story
. From it
she
gathered the
following
circumstances
.
Columbus, though he had made two voyages before,
one when he
discovered
St. Salvadora, and another with
relief and
supplies
for the colony he had left there, had
not
discovered
the part of the American continent of
which Cora was a native, till his third voyage; when
many noblemen and cavaliers from the court of Spain
accompanied him in his expedition, in hopes of
sharing
at once the glory and emolument the
discoveries
were
likely to produce.
Amongst
the gallant group of
gentlemen
was Ferdinando, only
son
of Columbus. He
landed with his father, both richly habited and followed
by a train of cavaliers equally gay. With white flags
waving, and their drawn
swords
pointed towards the
earth, they advanced to the party
described
by Cora to
be
assembled
on the
shore
. Orrabella,
struck
with the
majestic
yet conciliating mien of Columbus, perhaps
more with the
personal
beauty and elegant deportment
of Ferdinando, who advanced at his right hand,
pressed
forward to meet them; and with a countenance at once
expressive
of wonder, admiration and timidity, her
right arm extended
seemed
a barrier to prevent their
approaching her parents and
sisters
,
whilst
laying
her left hand on her
breast
she
knelt to the ground,
raising
her fine eyes in token of
supplication
.
Ferdinando
raised
her, laid his
sword
at her feet, and
throwing
a
string
of beads about her neck, told her, in the
language of nature, which is alike
understood
in all
nations, that
she
had nothing to fear.
Orrozombo,
assured
of their friendly intentions,
received
them cordially, and
shewed
them every mark of
hospitality
. They
resided
on the continent many
months, collecting ingots of pure gold, bars of
silver
,
with pearls, diamonds and coral, forming the
most
wealthy cargo ever borne into a
Spanish
port.
During the time Columbus and his followers tarried at
the Peruvian court, Ferdinando had
numberless
opportunities
of improving the favourable
impression
his
first
appearance made on the lovely Orrabella. He
soon
instructed
her in the
Spanish
tongue; and with equal
facility, became
himself
a proficient in her native
language
.
He found her
possessed
of
strong
powers of
mind, quick perception, ready wit; in
short
, an
understanding
capable of the
highest
improvement. The
mutual
passion
that
subsisted
between them was early
discovered
, and encouraged by their parents.
Columbus
looked forward to the union as a mean of
insuring
wealth and power to his
posterity
, and Orrozombo
imagined
,
by
resigning
his daughter to this young
stranger
,
he
secured
to
himself
a powerful friend and ally in
Columbus
.
For the Spaniards had taught his
subjects
many of the
useful
arts; and Science, by their means,
began to unfold her beauties to the delighted monarch
and his court.
Upon their marriage, Orrozombo gave up part of his
territories to Columbus, as a portion for his daughter;
and a colony was begun, where every thing was
regulated
according to the
Spanish
form of government.
This being
settled
to the
satisfaction
of all parties,
the adventurers prepared to
revisit
their native land;
D
and the royal bride of Ferdinando determined to go
with her
husband
. Several of her attendants were
appointed
to accompany her;
amongst
whom was the
mother of Cora, who at the
princess
's
request
took her
daughter with her. With many tears did Orrabella
quit her parents and
sisters
; tears which
seemed
to
forebode they would never meet again. Alas! Avarice
had
discovered
this new world was an
inexhaustible
mine of wealth; and, not content to
share
its
blessings
in common with the natives, came with rapine, war and
devastation
in her train: And as
she
tore open the
bowels of the earth to gratify her
insatiate
thirst
for
gold, her
steps
were marked with blood.
CHAP. V.
Ingratitude and Perfidy.
The
ship
in which Ferdinando and his bride
embarked
was
destined
to proceed immediately to
Spain; but Columbus
himself
, in a
small
caravel,
determined
to
cross
over to
Hispaniola
, and
visit
a colony
which now began to wear a very
flourishing
appearance.
Many families had emigrated from Spain,
some
of
considerable
distinction
; and Columbus had, previous to
his embarkation,
solicited
the government of this
colony
for an indigent friend, hoping he might in the new
world retrieve his ruined fortunes. It was partly a
wish
to
see
how his intention
succeeded
, that prompted
him to
visit
Hispaniola
at this time. The reception he
met with, and the manner of his return to Spain,
Columbia
found in the following letter.
Columbus to his Son Ferdinando.
Cadiz Harbour,
1499.
THY father is returned, my dear
son
, returned to his
native land. But how? Not as an
enterprising
spirit
whose
plans had proved
successful
,
should
return;
but as a traitor to his king, loaded with
ignominious
chains. Oh! my brave boy, I
see
thy noble
spirit
fire at the intelligence. But beware; conceal
the workings of thy
honest
soul
. To
prosper
in this
ungrateful world, you
must
wear the
mask
of
hypocrisy
;
wear the
semblance
of humility,
honesty
,
patriotism
, till you have obtained
some
favourite point,
then throw them
aside
as
useless
, and glory in the
success
of your
stratagems
.
Pardon me, my
son
, I write from the
impulse
of a
broken heart. I know you would
scorn
such
advice if
seriously
given, even from a father; but I have
suffered
so
much from ingratitude and duplicity, and have
seen
those
who
practise
them
most
,
seem
to
succeed
the
best
, that I would willingly
shut
my eyes on the light
of day, and
sink
into eternal
rest
. My dear
Ferdinando
,
your father has received a wound no time can heal.
Surely we
must
hope, that in the
blest
abodes of
immortality
,
the
soul
retains no remembrance of what
passed
in this
sublunary
state
;
else
certain I am, that the
delights
of
paradise
itself
would be alloyed by the
retrospect
of the ignominy I have endured, and the chains I
have worn.
And what will that
treasure
of my
soul
, thy adored
mother,
say
? How will my Beatina bear the
degradation
of her Columbus? Will not her father, (but lately
reconciled to his child) again
spurn
her from him?
And will not her haughty brothers and
sisters
pour
their
insolent
reproaches on the wife of a
disgraced
, a
ruined favourite? Your lovely Orrabella too! Alas!
I greatly fear,
whilst
we were
hospitably
entertained at
her father's court, we were ungratefully paving the
way for the introduction of war, rapine and
destruction
.
Yet
witness
, ye immortal Powers, I am
innocent
.
I
sought
not new worlds for
conquest
, or for
power; I felt, forcibly felt, the
blessings
of
Christianity
,
the comforts
resulting
from a commercial
intercourse
with other nations. I vainly thought
those
blessings
through my means might be extended, and
earnestly
wished
them participated by the whole world.
But I am venting the
sorrows
of my agonize
soul
,
and forget you are a
stranger
to what has
caused
them. Oh! ever, ever, may you remain a
stranger
to
such
anguish
. May my
son
never experience how
far beyond all other
miseries
which malice can inflict,
or human nature
suffer
, is the torture
occasioned
by
the
poisoned
sting
of ingratitude. But to my
sad
tale.
Light
pleasant
gales, and a
smooth
sea
quickly bore
the caravel in which I embarked to
Hispaniola
. A
certain emblem of the
vicissitudes
of human life; for
how often does the
sun
of
prosperity
gild the horizon,
and its delightful airs play around and
fascinate
the
senses
,
whilst
the
storms
of
adversity
hang
unobserved
,
ready to
burst
on our devoted heads.
Roldan (whom you
must
remember was appointed
through my
intercession
to the government of this
coloony
)
received me with the
gratest
marks of
respect
,
and a
profusion
of compliments. I ought to have
been upon my guard and
suspected
his
excessive
adulation
.
His
professions
of gratitude and attachment
pained me; but as I knew the
present
affluent
state
of
himself
and family originated from my
friendship
, I
attributed all to the
noblest
motives, nor once
suspected
,
that as I held him to my
bosom
I was enfolding a
serpent
that waited but an opportunity to
sting
me to the
heart.
The morning after my arrival the natives thronged
in crowds to
see
me, and in the
most
tumultuous
manner
expressed
their joy at my return. Roldan, with an
insidious
smile
, warned me to beware of giving them
too much encouragement. They are,
said
he, an
encroaching
set
of wretches, and will torment you
with complaints, which, as they
exist
only in their
own imaginations, it is not in your power to
redress
.
You had better
speak
to them a little
sternly
, and
dismiss
them to their homes.
How?
said
I, rather
surprised
, I do not rightly
understand
you. What privilege can
these
people
solicit
from you or me, which they have not a right to
demand? Is not this continent theirs by right of
nature
?
and is not the privilege of living here
unmolested
enjoyed by us through their
unsuspecting
good
nature
,
and the confidence they place in our
honest
intentions
?
and
shall
we
abuse
this confidence, repay
their
hospitality
by infringing their natural rights?
Heaven forbid! If they have complaints to make, it
is our duty to hear, and to the
utmost
of our power
redress
them.
As I
spoke
with fervor, I
observed
the countenance
of Roldan change. A livid
paleness
overspread
his
face; his eyes gleamed, his lips trembled, and every
features
expressed
a rage which he in vain attempted to
conceal by a haggard
smile
.
All is not as it
should
be,
said
I mentally; I
will inquire into the nature of the complaints he
seems
so
anxious to evade. If Roldan has made an
unjust
use
of his power, it is not our
past
friendship
shall
screen
him from my reproach, or lead me to
continue
him in a
station
he appears inadequate to fill.
Full of
these
thoughts, I immediately
set
an inquiry
on foot concerning the general conduct of Roldan and
his officers. I found they had
grossly
abused
the
power
intrusted
to them; that they had
distressed
and
treated the natives in many
cases
with the
utmost
barbarity
!
and that this arbitrary governor had
supported
the Spaniards in every act of
injustice
or enormity they
chose
to commit.
Having traced
these
grievances to their
source
, I
requested
a council might be called; and then, in the
most
forcible language I could think of, yet with
temper
and
mildness
, I
represented
to them all the iniquity
of their proceedings, conjured them to
redress
the
injuries
they had committed, and to reform the
government
.
Some few
seemed
pleased
with my
remonstrance
,
but the greater part heard me in
sullen
silence
.
Roldan thanked me with a
sarcastic
smile
for my
advice; but at the
same
time told me he held his
office
by a
commission
from the royal Ferdinand, and
to him only was accountable for his actions. I was
thunderstruck
by his
speech
and manner, and left the
council room in a perturbation of mind not
easily
described
.
Amongst
the officers under the command of
Roldan
in this
settlement
, was a young man of
dissolute
D 2
manners, named Diego. He was younger
son
son
to
a noble family; but having
dissipated
a
considerable
fortune, and from being at
first
only weak and
foolish
,
having become vicious, his friends thought proper to
solicit
employment for him in the new
settlement
, and
he was accordingly appointed third in command.
This man I found the
bosom
confidant and privy
counsellor
of Roldan. His rapacity knew no bounds;
his
passions
were his only
master
; and hurried by
them to dreadful
excesses
, he committed crimes at
which humanity at once
blushed
and trembled.
Though the very little knowledge I had of Diego had
by no means prejudiced me in his favour, I could not
have
supposed
he would have perpetrated crimes of
the
blackest
die without compunction, or that Roldan
would have openly dared to
sanction
his
licentiousness
;
but I was at length fatally convinced, that when vice
and folly are leagued together, there is no
wickedness
,
however horrible, at which they will
hesitate
.
Bruna was the only child of a venerable Indian,
whose
possessions
were
extensive
and valuable. I had
cultivated a
friendship
with the father of Bruna, when
first
the
settlement
was formed; and both
myself
and
followers experienced from him the
kindness
and
attention
which nature, when unadulterated by art, is ever
ready to offer to the
friendless
, or the
stranger
. His
dwelling was at our
service
; he
supplied
us plentifully
with goat's milk, the
flesh
of deer, dried maize, and
other comforts of life, which, to men who had
experienced
a tedious and
wearisome
voyage, were real
luxuries.
Bruna at this time was a lovely child of about
twelve years old;
she
was wild and untutored; but
there was
something
so
engaging in her manner,
so
fascinating
in her vivacity, that I could not
see
her
daily without becoming
insensibly
attached to her.
Her
curiosity
was unbounded; and the
surest
way to
become a favorite with her, was by gratifying a
propensity
which in general was directed to laudable
objects
.
I was charmed with her
artless
thirst
for
knowledge
,
and employed my
leisure
moments in
instructing
her. But thought eager to learn, that very
eagerness
counteracted her
wishes
. She was too
hasty
and
impetuous
to allow
herself
sufficient
time to become a
proficient in any thing; therefore all my attention
could do, was to give her a trifling knowledge of the
Spanish
language. For when I
spoke
to her of the
customs
and manners of the European world,
she
would laugh, and declare her own country manners
were
best
; for
she
could not
possibly
think any duty
obliged us to conceal our thoughts, or that any
custom
whatever could make it laudable to
speak
one
thing and think another. I give you this
slight
sketch
of her character, that you might not be
surprised
at
what I have to relate concerning this Indian heroine.
It was about ten days after my arrival, as I was
walking a few miles from the plantation, and
remarking
the improvement agriculture had made on the face
of this beautiful fertile continent, when in a low-built
hovel I
saw
an ancient Indian
seated
on the ground;
his elbows
rested
on his knees, his hands
clasped
his
forehead, as his head reclined upon them. I
stopped
for a moment to contemplate a figure
so
striking
; and
as I
paused
, the
sighs
that broke from his agitated
bosom
, went to my very heart. The
noise
I
undesignedly
made as I moved neaxer the hovel,
occasioned
him to
raise
his head. I was amazed; it was the
father of Bruna! He gazed for a moment eagerly upon
me; then
springing
forward, fell on his knees,
kissed
my hands, my
seet
, the very hem of my garments.
In vain I attempted to
raise
him; he
prostrated
himself
on the earth, and laid my hand upon his head, in
token of owning me for his
master
.
Pray
rise
, my worthy friend,
said
I, and tell me
what is the meaning of this humiliation? who has
caused
the change I perceive to have taken place in
your
circumstances
?
Christians
!
Christians
! replied he with
vehemence
,
gnashing
his teeth as he
spoke
, they have
plundered me of my wealth, torn my child from my
arms; but you are come, and I
shall
be revenged.
The confidence this poor Indian
seemed
to have in my
integrity, filled my eyes with tears.
Yes,
said
I, tell me who has treated you thus
barbarously
; and if I have the power, you
shall
have
ample
restitution
. Alas! cried the old man, of
what avail will be the
restitution
of my wealth,
unless
you can
restore
my child, my darling to my arms
pure and
unspotted
?
He then informed me that
soon
after the arrival of
Roldan at the
settlement
, an entire change took place
in the government; vice was tolerated, private
property
not in the
least
regarded, but every thing
subjected
to the
lawless
power of the new governor and his
favourite.
Diego
saw
Bruna; her beauty kindled in his
bosom
an unholy flame; he
solicited
her love and was rejected.
He dared attempt her
chastity
, and was
repulsed
with
scorn
. That moment
sealed
the ruin of her father.
Diego complained to Roldan, that the father of Bruna
refused
to
submit
to the
Spanish
laws, and had even
treated him with contempt and
derision
, who had
endeavoured
to enforce them. Roldan, glad of an
opportunity
to gratify his ruling
passion
, which was avarice,
gave ear to the complaint of his favourite; and
driving
the unoffending Indian from a home he had
inherited
from his
ancestors
,
seized
on all his valuable
property,
ostensibly
in the name of the
Spanish
King,
but in reality to enrich his own private coffers.
Bruna, unknowing to what danger
she
exposed
herself
,
and thinking this piece of
injustice
was entirely the
act of Diego, flew to the governor for
redress
. Her tears,
her innocent
supplications
, had no effect on the
obdurate
heart of Roldan! he inhumanly rejected her
suit
,
detained her
person
, and gave her into the power of
Diego. This horrid
scene
was acted but the day
before
my arrival.
You
shall
have
justice
, old man,
said
I; come
with me. He followed me to the
house
of the
governor
.
At
sight
of him, Roldan
started
and turned pale;
but
soon
recovering
himself
, he
asked
him, in a
stern
voice, what he did there. He comes for
justice
,
said
I, he comes to demand
restitution
of his
property
,
of which he has been robbed, and his daughter,
who is
unjustly
detained from him. The artful
wretch has
imposed
on you,
said
Roldan fiercely,
but go,
slave
, turning to the Indian, get from my
sight
, and be thankful your
insolence
does not
cost
you
your life. I was preparing to reply in a proper
manner to this inhuman tyrant, when Bruna
rushed
into the apartment, her hair
dishevelled
her garments
disordered
, and her eyes wild with terror. She threw
herself
into her father's arms, and gave way to a
violent
gush
of tears; but the
tenderness
that
seemed
to
overcome her was but momentary. She recovered
herself
, and
raising
her head, looked round with a
kind of
sullen
dignity. Her eyes met mine.
Perceiving
she
knew me, I offered her my hand, and was
proceeding to comfort her; but with a rejecting
motion
,
she
put back my
prossered
hand, and covering
her face with both her own, turned from me. I
instantly
comprehended the extent of the injury
she
had
sustained
, and my
soul
shuddered
within me.
Roldan's agitation was too great to
escape
notice;
he attempted twice to
speak
, but words were denied
him. His pale countenance betrayed his guilty heart.
At length he
hesitatingly
told Bruna, if that was
her father, and
she
had forcibly been detained from
him,
she
was now at liberty to return home. The
poor girl
stood
for a moment the image of mute
despair
;
then
raising
her hands and eyes to heaven, cried,
Home! No! never! Bruna is the daughter of the
chaste
Lilah, and was
instructed
by the
wise
precepts
of her father, to prize her honour above her life. Their
mansion
was the dwelling of innocence, piety, and
virtue
;
and never will their wretched daughter carry
pollution
thither. Then turning toward her father,
she
made as though
she
would have embraced him; but
with a kind of involuntary
shudder
,
shrunk
again from
him, and drawing a dagger
she
had concealed in her
bosom
, plunged it in her heart.
This
sudden
, unexpected event threw the governor
and all his attendants into the
utmost
confusion
.
The
servants
, terrified, opened the doors; and a
concourse
of people, Spaniards as well as natives,
rushed
in. The bleeding form of the lovely Bruna, the
agonizing
sorrow
of her father, acted like a
talisman
on the minds of the people; and in a few hours the
whole
settlement
was in a
state
of
insurrection
.
Justice
!
justice
! was the cry: Deliver up Diego to our
power, or we will extirpate the race of
Christians
from
amongst
us. Roldan in this exigence applied to me
to quiet the enraged multitude. I
spoke
to them; I
promised
they
should
have ample
justice
! I
soothed
them
by
speaking
of the virtues of Bruna, and execrating
the author of her ruin, and
consequent
death; and at
length
persuaded
them to depart quietly to their homes;
assuring
them that Diego was in confinement, and
should
be made to
suffer
, to the extent of the law, the
punishment
due to his crimes.
After a day of
such
unusual
agitation, I retired to
my apartment. Fatigued in body, and
distressed
in
mind,
sleep
was a
stranger
to my eyes, and I was
ruminating
on the
best
means to
appease
the irritated natives,
when a band of Roldan's guards entered my
chamber
,
and
arrested
me as a traitor to my king,
accused
me of being
disaffected
to his government, and
inflaming
the minds of his
subjects
in
Hispaniola
to
rebellion
.
Resistance
or
remonstrance
was vain; they were
the tools of arbitrary power, and I
submitted
in
silence
.
They manacled my hands and feet, and putting a
gag in my mouth, conveyed me on board a
vessel
lying
in the harbour. Yes, Ferdinando, your father
was chained, and
sent
to his native country as a traitor.
As
soon
as I was on board, and the guard departed,
I found, by the motion of the
vessel
, we were under
way; the wind was fair, and
she
left the
shores
of
Hispaniola
with rapidity.
About two hours after daylight, the captain entered
the cabin where I was, and entreated my pardon for
having been obliged to act contrary to his inclinations.
I am but a
servant
,
said
he, and
must
obey
those
whom the king has
set
over me. I am ordered to
keep you a
close
prisoner
till our arrival in Spain;
but here I
shall
dare to
transgress
my orders
so
far as
to
release
you from your chains. He then advanced
to take off the
insulting
badges of my
disgrace
, but I
forbid him. No, Don Sancho,
said
I, if I am
guilty, I will
suffer
the
sentence
my
sovereign
may
think proper to
pass
on me with
resignation
. If I
have been
unjustly
accused
, to him do I look for
redress
;
into his
presence
will I go, loaded with
these
ignominious bonds, and when my innocence is proved,
from his hands only will I accept of liberty.
Hasten
then, my dear
son
, on the immediate receipt
of this, to my royal
mistress
and
patroness
; deliver
to her own hand the
inclosed
few lines; and
should
she
condescend
to
request
it, lay the contents of this
letter before her. Comfort and
console
your angel
mother ere you leave her. Embrace your charming
wife for me.
Whilst
I live, you
share
my heart
amongst
you. The
strong
sense
I have of my
present
injuries,
is only for your
sakes
? for of what
consequence
would
the
smiles
or frowns of princes be to me, were not my
wife and children to be involved in my
disgrace
, or
exalted
by my
success
and honour.
Hasten
, my
son
,
after
you have fulfilled this
commission
, to the arms of
your father; come, my brave boy, and by a filial tear
heal the
anguish
, which at
present
corrodes the heart of
COLUMBUS.
CHAP. VI.
Retribution.
Columbia
could only
pause
for a moment to
wipe off the tears which,
spite
of her endeavours
to
suppress
them, would
rush
to her eyes. She then
proceeded to the next letter.
Ferdinando to his Mother.
HAD I a conveyance,
swift
as my own impatience,
to forward to my revered mother the joyful tidings of
my father's triumph over his enemies, the wings of
the wind would be too tardy to bear this to your hands.
Yes, my dear mother, Columbus, the great, the
enterprizing
Columbus, is
restored
to all his former dignity,
and even
fresh
honours are heaped upon him. But I
know you
wish
me to be particular; and how can I
be more
pleasingly
employed than in recounting the
noble conduct of a father, and obeying the commands
of the
best
of mothers?
When in obedience to my father's mandate I
repaired
to court, and
requested
an audience with the
royal
Issabelle
, I was, within a few hours after the
Iabelle">Issabelle
, I was, within a few hours after the
re-request
was made, admitted. An
unusual
gloom,
almost
approaching to
severity
, was
cast
over a
countenance
,
which heretofore had only on me beamed
smiles
of benevolence. It chilled me to the heart. I
approached
with extreme agitation; and, bending one knee
to the ground,
presented
the
sealed
paper which was
inclosed
in my father's letter. The queen
paused
for a
moment,
seemingly
irresolute
whether or not to break
the
seal
. My agitation
increased
, my knees trembled,
my heart beat violently. My
disorder
did not
pass
unnoticed. Calm your fears, Ferdinando,
said
Issabelle
,
as
she
at length opened the letter; your
father
has, it is true, powerful enemies; but if his
innocence
is apparent, he will ever find in me a
steady
,
powerful friend. I bowed in grateful
acknowledgement
of her
goodness
, and
she
in
silence
perused
the
letter. A
crimson
glow
overspread
her face as
she
read;
it
seemed
the glow of
resentment
, as folding the paper
she
unlocked a
small
cabinet, and
deposited
it
amongst
some
other writings.
You have a letter from Columbus,
said
she
,
permit me to
see
it. I
presented
it. Go,
said
she
, taking it from me, retire in peace; the
success
of
my hero has awakened the envy of
those
who had not
courage to follow his example, he has been traduced
to the king; but
Isabelle
will not
suffer
a man,
whose
merit
she
esteems
and
whose
cause
she
espouses
, to be
injured with impunity.
Charmed by
these
condescending
expressions
, I
bowed
and retired. In about two hours, I received a
mandate
signed
by the queen's hand, ordering me to repair
immediately to the port, and conduct my injured
father
to her
presence
. Take off his chains, were the
words, and let him come to his
sovereign
, attended
with all the
respect
and honour a man
deserves
, who,
whilst
he was adding new territories to our crown,
whilst
he had it in his power to heap up mines of wealth
for his own coffers, forgot not the
cause
of humanity,
and rather than countenance one act of tyranny,
hazarded
the
displeasure
of his king, the
loss
of his fortune,
nay even life
itself
. But his
sovereign
shall
reward him.
Her
majesty
's own
servants
and mules attended my
commands; and quick as it was
possible
, I
pursued
my
journey, and flew to the arms of my father. Our
meeting was beyond
description
. The agitation of his
mind had affected his health; his countenance was pale
and dejected; his
person
neglected. I offered to take off
his fetters,
shewed
him the queen's mandate, but in
vain. I will go to my royal
mistress
,
said
he, but
I will go as I am. When he
saw
the
servants
that
attended
to conduct himPoor pageantry,
said
he,
pitiful
recompense
for the injuries I have received!
No! no! I will have no attendants. I am a
disgraced
man, and will enter the metropolis with as little
noise
as
possible
;
obscurity
and
silence
suits
best
with
dishonour
.
But mark me, my
son
, as my
disgrace
has
been public,
so
shall
be my
justification
. There was
such
majesty
in his manner,
such
fixed
resolution
in his
looks, I dared not
oppose
him. I
dismissed
the retinue
that attended; and with only my own
servant
,
accompanied
my father, by the
most
unfrequented roads, to
the court of Ferdinand and
Isabelle
.
It was about twelve o'clock when we arrived, and
orders were given for our immediate
admission
. Never
shall
I forget the countenance of the royal
Isabelle
,
when
she
beheld her hero enter thus encumbered with
the
testimonies
of his
disgrace
. The king and queen were
seated
at the upper end of the
presence
chamber,
attended
by many noblemen and cavaliers, tried friends
of my father, and
some
whom I knew to be his
enemies
.
Columbus entered the door a few
steps
, then
E
making a full
stop
, bent his knee to the ground, and
raising
his manacled hands, attempted to
speak
; but
pride,
resentment
, wounded honour,
swelled
his brave
heart nearly to
bursting
; and,
spite
of his endeavours
to
suppress
them, the
scalding
tears rolled down his
pale face. It was a reproach more poignant than
words could have conveyed.
Isabelle
rose
from her
seat
, her own eyes
glistening
with the dew of
sensibility
; and advancing to my
father,
raised
him.
Rise
, my brave admiral,
said
she
, and let thy queen take off
these
fetters, of which
she
has more
cause
to be
ashamed
than you have.
Then leading him to the king, Royal Sir,
said
she
,
how
shall
we
recompense
this worthy man for the
undeserved
humiliation he has received?
Columbus
,
said
Ferdinand, I
blush
for the indignities
offered
you in the
person
of my
representative
; but
you
shall
have ample revenge. Go to your wife and
friends, indulge awhile in
case
, and recruit your
strength
and
spirits
; in the mean time, I will give
orders
for the preparation of a fleet
superior
to any you
have yet commanded; in it you
shall
return to our new
colonies, of the whole of which I from this moment create
you viceroy, giving you unlimited power to create or
displace
officers, and
distribute
rewards and
punishments
at
pleasure
. I know it is a power you will not
abuse
. Go, valiant chief, and reign over a people,
whom you have conquered by
practising
humanity,
not the arts of war. But take
those
fetters from my
sight
, continued he; that Columbus ever wore
them, will
cast
a
lasting
shade
on my memory; and
ages yet unborn, when they
shall
hear the tale
related
,
will
accuse
Ferdinand of ingratitude.
Pardon me, gracious
sire
,
said
my father,
placing
his foot on the chains as one of the guards
attempted
to remove them;
these
fetters are mine. I
purchased
them with fatigue and danger, went through
many perils by
sea
and land to obtain them, nor will I
lightly part with them. Wherever I go, they
shall
go with me; I will contemplate them every day,
lest
prosperity
should
make me forget, on what a frail
tenure
I hold my
happiness
. I will look at them; and
whilst
I recollect the
anguish
I felt when they were
imposed
on me, learn to be cautious how I attempt to
inflict
the
same
misery
on a fellow creature. When I
am unhappy, I will cheer my heart by the
remembrance
,
that the moment when my royal
mistress
took
these
fetters off my hands, was the
most
transporting
moment
of my life; for it
reinstated
me in the good
opinion
of my
sovereign
, gave my friends
cause
for
exultation
,
and covered my enemies with
consusion
.
Ferdinand was
silent
.
Isabelle
smiled
; it was a
smile
of triumph. You
must
do as you
please
,
said
she
. Then turning to the guard, convey them to
wherever Columbus orders; his intrepid
spirit
can
convert even fetters into badges of
distinction
.
Their
majesties
then left the chamber followed by
the court, and in a moment I was locked in the arms
of my father, and mingled with him
some
of the
most
delicious tears I ever
shed
. Tell my lovely Orrabella,
in a few hours after
she
receives this, I
shall
be at her
feet. Yes, my revered mother, I
shall
behold once
more all the
dearest
objects of my affections united in
one family circle. I
shall
see
your dear countenance
beam with heartfelt
satisfaction
;
see
my father happy
in the
bosom
of his family; and in the
smiles
of my
Orrabella and her
sweet
infant, enjoy every felicity of
which human nature is capable. Farewel till we
meet.
FERDINANDO.
The next paper Columbia opened had the
appearance
more of a
manuscript
than a letter. It
consisted
of
several
sheets
of paper wrote on all
sides
; it was
from the wife of Columbus,
addressed
to her
granddaughter
Isabelle
.
Beatina to Isabelle.
Valladolid,
1520.
AS the
perusal
of the
inclosed
letters and papers
will no doubt awaken in the
bosom
of my dear
Isabelle
,
a
curiosity
to learn the events that followed this
triumph
of Columbus over his enemies; and as I think
it
necessary
to inform her, not only of her
descent
from
the native kings of Peru, but
also
of the
sate
of her
parents, who now, alas! are no more, I have taken
up my pen to trace every
circumstance
that may tend
to prove your right to the
sovereignty
of Quito, and
the
surrounding
territories, if hereafter you
should
think
it worth contending for. But as I leave you, my dear
child, in the protection of my own family; and am
fully
sensible
that my nephew, the marquis Guidova, will
take
such
care of your fortune, (now ample) that by
the time you are of age to
peruse
these
papers, you
will be one of the
richest
heiresses
in Spain; I fondly
hope you will not
suffer
the vain ambition of bearing
the empty title of queen to influence your conduct, or
tempt you to throw away the real
blessings
of life in
pursuit
of
shadows
and toys.
I am old, my dear
Isabelle
, and have lived to bury
all my
dearest
affections in the
silent
grave, except the
kindly lambent flame that warms my languid heart
when I behold your innocent
smiles
, and
listen
to your
lively prattle. You are now
scarcely
five years old;
I cannot therefore expect to live to
see
you enter on the
busy
stage
of life. Let me entreat you then (and think,
as you
peruse
this, your grandmother
speaks
to you
from the grave) let me entreat you to pay the
strictest
attention to the advice of your uncle and his amiable
wife. Certain I am, they will never
impose
harsh
commands
;
and to them I leave the full power of
controlling
and directing you during the dangerous period of
youth.
One thing I think it proper you
should
know, in the
choice of a partner for life, (though I would
wish
you
to
consult
those
dear friends,) you are entirely your
own
mistress
. At the age of 21, your fortune will be
put in your own power; but,
Isabelle
, remember the
royal race from whence you
sprang
, and do not
disgrace
it by an ignoble alliance. It is not wealth, it is not
titles
,
I would have you
seek
! no, my child;
seek
courage
,
honour, good
sense
, and
polished
manners.
These
constitute
true nobility; it was
these
so
eminently
distinguished
the great Columbus; made him the
delight
of our
sex
, the envy of his own.
I
say
you are your own
mistress
; in every point but
one you are
so
. I charge you,
Isabelle
, as you value
your eternal peace, unite not your fate with that of a
heretic. Should you unhappily feel a growing
inclination
for one of
those
impious innovators on the rights
and ceremonies of our holy mother church, repel it
with your
utmost
power; for in that
case
your
guardian
has my authority peremptorily to
refuse
his
sanction
to your union. And
should
you form
such
a
connexion
in defiance of his
absolute
commands, your
fortune, on the
instant
of your marriage, becomes
forfeit
,
and will go to the marquis's
eldest
son
. My
wishes
to
see
you not only temporally but eternally
happy, have led me to make this point
indisputable
;
but I
trust
it is a
needless
caution,
since
you will be
brought up in the true religion, in the religion of your
ancestors
; and will feel a
just
abhorrence for
those
licentious wretches, who arrogantly
style
themselves
reformers. Of all the European courts, none are
so
infested
with this
sect
as the
English
. Beware, then;
and when you behold a gay,
accomplished
Englishman
,
and many
such
visit
the court of Spain, before
you venture too nearly to contemplate his
seeming
virtues and graces,
say
within
yourself
, May not this
man be tinctured with the principles I am cautioned
to avoid? Think thus, avoid him, and be happy.
CHAP. VII.
Return to the new World.
Alas
,
said
Columbia, laying down the paper,
I now
see
the
source
from whence
sprang
all
my dear mother's
sorrow
. She was bred in the
Catholic
persuasion
, and my father tempted her to
disobey
the rigid commands of her guardian, forfeit her
fortune
,
embrace his faith, and, leaving all her
connexions
E 2
in Spain, follow him to England. Poor,
bigoted
Beatina, little did you think, when making your
will, that you
signed
the mandate for your grandchild's
misery
. For what might not avarice tempt the
son
of the marquis Guidova to do? Might not he wink
at a marriage that was to
invest
him with all the
vast
wealth of the unfortunate
Isabelle
? But perhaps I
injure him; he may be innocent of
such
an intention;
my
misguided
parents
themselves
may be alone to
blame. Yet knowing and adoring them as I do, how
can I believe that
possible
? Thus was Columbia
bewildered with conjecture. At length, thinking the
manuscript
might
satisfy
her
curiosity
, and remove
her doubts,
she
again
addressed
herself
to the
perusal
of it.
It was the beginning of the year 1500,
that the great Columbus embarked on board
the fleet which Ferdinand had ordered to be equipped
for his
service
, (with all the attendance, ceremonies,
&c.
customary
on
such
occasions
,) as viceroy of the
new-
discovered
continent. Ferdinando was appointed
governor of the
settlements
in Peru.
Myself
, the
princess
Orrabella, and her
son
Christopher
, embarked
with them. The king, queen, and all the court
attended
us to the water
side
; a
vast
concourse
of
people
crowded the
shore
, wearying Heaven with prayers
for our
happiness
whilst
absent
, and our
safe
return.
At parting from his
august
patroness
, Columbus knelt
to
kiss
her hand. She
raised
him, and throwing a
gold chain over his neck, by which her own portrait
was
suspended
, Go, my invincible hero,
said
she
, go, and enjoy the reward of your labours.
And if we never meet again on this
side
eternity, let
my memory ever be dear to you; for
whilst
you live,
Columbus, you will never find a truer friend than you
have found in
Isabelle
. As
she
sinished
speaking
,
she
inclined her head towards him; he
respecfully
saluted
her cheek. Heaven ever
bless
and defend
my royal
mistress
and her
august
consort
,
said
Columbus
.
And protect my hero, added the queen.
Then turning
hastily
to hide her tears,
she
rushed
into
the
midst
of her attendants, and retired. Yes, my
child, the good, the noble-hearted, royal
Isabelle
retired
;
and we
saw
her no more. Before we returned,
she
slept
in peace; but her name
shall
be revered to
after ages. The brave and worthy will remember it
with gratitude; and the pious tears of millions yet
unborn,
shall
sanctify
her memory to all eternity.
It was determined at our departure, that the
whole fleet
should
accompany Ferdinando and
Orrabella
to her native
coast
; and having
seen
him
safely
settled
in his government, proceed to
Hispaniola
, and
send
Roldan and his licentious
associates
home in the
same
disgraceful
circumstances
in which he had before
ungratefully involved Columbus. A fine
season
favoured
our voyage; and in
less
than two months from
our embarkation, we
saw
the fertile
shores
of Peru
rise
upon our
sight
. The joy of Orrabella as
she
beheld
her native land was beyond all bounds. I
shall
see
my
father and mother,
said
she
, and embrace my dear
sisters
; I
shall
sit
beside
them for hours, and relate to
them the wonders I have
seen
in your world; and
only
that they know my lips abhor
falsehood
, they would
think
some
of the
strange
things I have to relate were
nothing more than fictions. Then
caressing
her child,
she
would talk of the joy of her father's
subjects
when
they
should
behold her offspring, whom
she
fully
believed
was born to
sway
the
sceptre
of Peru.
It was on the
second
day after we had
discovered
land, that we reached the
desired
harbour. But as we
drew near no
shouts
of joy welcomed our approach;
no king, no guards, no exulting
subjects
appeared to
greet us. All was
silent
, all was
desolate
. Our hearts
sunk
within us. They are at Quito,
said
Orrabella
;
but her pallid countenance and tremulous voice
betrayed that
she
hardly dared hope what
she
asserted
.
We will land, however,
said
Columbus; accordingly
the boat was
hoisted
out, and we proceeded to the
shore
.
When within a few yards of the beach, a party of
armed
men appeared. Their
dress
, their arms,
bespoke
them Spaniards. Our fleet bore the
standard
of Spain,
we could not fear our countrymen as foes. Columbus
addressed
them from the boat in terms of amity; they
returned a haughty
answer
. However, they permitted
us to land. But Oh!
Isabelle
, what were our feelings,
when we
discovered
this beautiful continent had been
invaded by a party of freebooters; its
hospitable
inhabitants rifled of all their
treasures
, many of
them
massacred
, and the remainder driven
into
the interior parts of the country. The palace
of Orrozombo was converted into a den for
these
robbers, where riot and intemperance reigned
without control. The
settlers
left by Columbus,
adhering
to the
interest
of the king and natives, were
driven with them to
seek
an
asylum
in the woods and
mountains.
The chief of
these
banditti was named Garcias,
fierce, cruel and vindictive. He received Columbus
with a gloomy
haughtiness
of demeanor, and when
questioned
as to his right in
these
dominions, he
scornfully
replied, By the right of
conquest
; not by a
ridiculous family compact with a
savage
. Orrabella
was
present
when Garcias thus
insulted
her family.
Insolent
Spaniard,
said
she
, her eyes darting
lightning
,
her fine face and
person
uncommonly animated
by the fire of
resentment
;
insolent
Spaniard, the
king my father, though you term him a
savage
, was
your
superior
in every virtue! What though
unpolished
,
he had but nature for his guide? that nature taught
him humanity, honour, patience, fortitude, and
Orrozombo
would have died rather than deceive a friend,
or
insult
a fallen foe. Oh my father! my father!
continued
she
,
bursting
into an agony of tears, where
are you now? Where is my revered mother, my poor
defenceless
sisters
? Tell me, barbarian, have you entirely
extirpated the race of the children of the
sun
, or do you
hold the lawful king of this territory in bondage,
whilst
you
usurp
his rights, and riot in the
spoils
of his
devoted
subjects
? If
so
, Oh lead me to the dungeon where
you have confined him, that I may weep in his arms,
and die with grief to
see
my king, my father, a
slave
to the nation he had vainly hoped to have held in
eternal bonds of
friendship
, and gave his child as a
hostage
of his faith towards them. Alas! what
hostage
did he require to
insure
their faith to him? None; his
noble heart harboured not deceit, nor could
suspect
it in
another.
From
these
pathetic
remonstrances
and lamentations
of Orrabella, we perceived
she
suspected
Columbus
and Ferdinando were knowing to the voyage and
consequent
invasion
of Garcias and his
lawless
band;
but in this
she
was
soon
undeceived. For Columbus,
irritated
by the
insolence
of Garcias, threatened him with
speedy
vengeance
unless
he informed him where
Orrozombo
and the royal family were. Garcias laughed at
his menaces, but on being informed that Columbus was
deputed viceroy of all the new-
discovered
lands on that
side
the globe, and being
requested
to do homage to him
as the
representative
of his royal
master
Ferdinand,
or expect the
punishment
due to a pirate, a traitor
and a robber, he became more humble, and many
of his followers,
understanding
the dangerous
predicament
in which they
stood
, declared
themselves
ready
to
support
the new viceroy in the
discharge
of his duty
as the king's delegate, and as
such
swore
allegiance to
him.
It was then we learnt that Garcias Du Ponty, a
Castilian
by birth, young,
dissolute
and ambitious, having
heard of the
success
of Columbus, and the
vast
treasures
himself
and followers had brought from the new world,
resolved
to make an experiment
himself
; and having, by
promises
of large future reward, and
some
rich
presents
artfully
bestowed
, won over an experienced
mariner
(who had been the
last
voyage with your
grandfather
,
and returned in the
ship
with Orrabella) to
undertake to navigate his
vessel
, and give directions to
the pilots of the
rest
of the fleet how to follow him;
Garcias prevailed on a number of young
Castilian
noblemen and gentlemen to embark on the expedition.
They applied for no letters of leave from Ferdinand;
for had they, it is
most
probable they would have been
prevented
pursuing
this (in the end) ruinous voyage.
A large fleet collected from the different ports of
Spain, met in the Mediterranean
sea
many other
mariners
who
wished
to
pursue
their good fortune, and,
not being content to wait till another fleet
should
be
sent
out by the king's orders, were eager to embark
with
these
licentious noblemen, and direct their
course
to the land where they imagined they were to become
petty princes, and revel in all the luxuries which
nature
could afford, or unbounded wealth
supply
.
This fleet was on the ocean at the time Columbus
returned from
Hispaniola
. They had a more
speedy
voyage than their inhuman
designs
deserved
; but
Heaven often permits the wicked for a while to
prosper
,
that the
success
of their
lawless
plans may
become
their
punishment
, and the
reverse
of fortune
coming unexpected, may fall the heavier on them.
And thus it proved with Garcias Du Ponty and his
followers.
On their arrival on the
coast
of Peru, they found
the king with his family, as was their
custom
,
spending
the
summer
at their palace on the banks of a river
that mingles its waters with the ocean. Garcias and
his party landed. Orrozombo, and indeed the
Spanish
settlers
, believed them to be a party
sent
by
Columbus
to bring
supplies
to the colony, and received
them with open arms and every mark of affection.
But alas, they were too fatally undeceived, when
these
invaders of the rights of nature and the law of nations
assumed
the authority of
masters
, exacting enormous
sums
as tribute from the king, and forcing his
subjects
to labour in the mines, often rewarding
those
labours
(when the produce of them was not equal to the
inordinate
avarice of their
desires
) with death.
Orrozombo, wearied by their repeated
insolence
,
and terrified by their rapacity, entreated them to leave
the continent, offering them
immense
treasures
. But
they were not thus to be
satisfied
. They proceeded
from one
step
to another, till neither age nor
sex
became
a
safeguard
from their cruelties. The
chaste
wife and the pure virgin were violated in the
presence
of their parents and protectors, who, confined by
these
inhuman
monsters
, had not the power to
rescue
or
avenge them.
Human nature, however patient, could not tamely
endure
such
enormities. The natives and the
Spaniards
united their forces to endeavour to expel the
invaders
;
but it was too late. They had
sent
a part
of their company to
search
the interior country for
mines.
These
returned,
boasting
of the ravages they
had commited, and
displaying
the
spoils
they had
gleaned. They had plundered every village through
which they
passed
, and then
set
fire to it.
Thousands
of innocent families, thus deprived of their homes and all
means of
support
, fled into the mountains, where many
perished
through famine, and the
rest
dragged on a
wretched life, living on wild fruit, and what game
their bows and arrows produced,
sleeping
in caves or
recesses
of the rocks, and too often their
miserable
existence
was terminated by the fangs of the tyger or the
lion.
Flushed
with
success
, the
Castilians
meditated
only
how to make an entire
conquest
of the country.
Undisciplined
in the arts of war, and though
experiencing
its effect every hour,
still
unsuspecting
of
treachery
,the
Peruvians were at this time, by the art of
the Spaniards, induced to throw
aside
their arms, and
agree to terms of peace with Garcias, who
assumed
a
graver demeanor, and made
some
slight
concessions
to
Orrozombo for the
misconduct
of his companions, who
by a few weeks of quiet regular behaviour lulled him
into
security
; then, when in full confidence of the faith
of their enemies, the Peruvians, who had been
celebrating
the annual
feast
of the
sun
at which
these
strangers
had been admitted to participate; then, when parting
from them in amity they tranquilly
sunk
to
rest
; then
did the blood-
thirsty
Garcias and his
detested
crew
rush
on the
defenceless
victims, and
massacre
them without
mercy and without
remorse
.
Oh thou Power eternal,
whose
name is a tower of
strength
, and
whose
mercy is as infinite as thy
wisdom
!
what
shall
we
say
, that
these
barbarians
should
call
themselves
thy
servants
, and bear the glorious
appellation
of
Christians
? Alas,
mistaken
men, the God you
serve
delighteth not in blood; his precept and example
taught peace, mercy and good will to all mankind.
But the Peruvians were idolaters! cries the
misguided
enthusiast
; and
so
was Garcias and his followers; their
idols were avarice, ambition, luxury, and
lawless
passion
;
to them they bent the knee, and on their altars did
they
sacrifice
millions of innocent people.But I
digress
.
Du Ponty, though the wretch his actions proclaim
him, was
handsome
in his
person
, gay, lively and
gallant
;
his fair
outside
attracted the notice of Alzira,
the
youngest
sister
of Orrabella. Alzira was equally
lovely as her
sister
, but
she
possessed
not that
greatness
of
soul
, that intrepid
firmness
which characterized your
mother. By nature
soft
, gentle and complying, when
the
subtle
Castilian
, who read her
passion
in her
admiring
eyes,
sued
for
some
token of her favour,
she
hesitated
not to own her love, and
confess
, could her father
be brought to approve it, to be the wife of Du Ponty
would
constitute
her chief felicity.
But Garcias had not an idea of an honourable union;
he meant to conquer her father's kingdom; and had
it in contemplation to degrade the fair Alzira to the
station
of a
slave
, for the
amusement
of his
looser
hours.
On the night of the horrid
massacre
, Garcias was
purposely
in the apartment of the
princess
, where he
was frequently privately admitted after her parents
were retired to
rest
. Alzira, who was listening to the
adulating voice of her lover, did not at
first
attend to
the
confused
murmur that ran through the palace on
the entrance of the Spaniards; but a
sudden
shriek
,
that
seemed
to come from the apartment of her mother,
roused
her dormant
senses
. She
started
, and would have
run to the
assistance
of her parents, whom
she
imagined
were
suddenly
taken ill, but reiterated
shrieks
which now
issued
from every room in the palace, made her
pause
,
and
she
became a
motionless
statue
of horror.
The palace is
beset
, cried Garcias, let me bear
you, lovely Alzira, to a place of
safety
; I will then
return
to the
assistance
of your father. Oh no! now,
now
rescue
him, or let me die with him, was all
she
could
say
, before Du Ponty bore her in his arms, out of
the chamber, and down the
stairs
. At the foot of
these
stairs
she
saw
(by the light of torches which were every
where flaming round) her father dragged by the hair
of his head;
whilst
an inhuman wretch,
regardless
of
his grey hairs and
defenceless
state
, plunged a poniard
in his
bosom
. Alzira, driven
almost
to
madness
at the
sight
,
sprang
from the arms of Garcias, and threw
herself
into
those
of the dying monarch. He knew his
child,
pressed
her to his
bosom
, faintly articulated a
blessing
on her, and expired.
Alzira's
senses
forsook
her. In that
state
she
was
borne to the tent of her betrayer. The
scene
that
followed
is too horrid for repetition! Morning dawned,
and the ill-fated
princess
awoke to a perfect
sense
of all the
miseries
of her
situation
. She
wished
for death, but all
means of accelerating that period was removed from
her. She once conceived the thought of
refusing
all food,
but had not
resolution
to
persist
. Garcias was
attentive
and kind; pretended to mourn with her the fate
of her parents: She, not fully acquainted with his
treachery,
listened
to his
soothings
, was
consoled
, and
endured life for his
sake
. But uninterrupted
possession
brought on
satiety
, and at length indifference and
disgust
.
Du Ponty neglected and treated her
harshly
.
She felt her
situation
, but
she
was now a mother, and
more than ever attached to the father of her child;
she
dragged on a wretched
existence
, without joy,
without
hope, without even a dawn of comfort.
The natives of Peru who had
escaped
the
swords
of
the
Castilians
on that memorable night, failed not to
attribute their misfortunes to their unhappy
sovereign
Orrozombo; he had been
slack
in the
observance
of
some
of the ceremonious devotions directed to be paid to
their deity, the Sun; he had even doubted whether
their religion was the true religion; he had
refused
to
dedicate one of his daughters to the
service
of their
god; he had married the
heiress
of his crown and
kingdom to a
stranger
, who
absolutely
denied the
divinity
of the power they
worshipped
, and called their
rites and ceremonies,
absurdities
and
superstitions
;
and had
suffered
this
stranger
to carry her with him
to a
distant
land.
These
, in the eyes of the
unenlightened
F
Peruvians, were heinous offences, and had drawn
down the wrath of their deity upon them; and thus,
for the crimes of an individual, did they
foolishly
imagine
a whole nation was
punished
.
It was at this period our fleet arrived, but the name
of Spaniard and of
Christian
had become hateful to the
ears of the natives; not one therefore appeared to
espouse
the
cause
of Columbus, imagining no doubt that
they
should
but expel one tyrant to make room for
another. Some few ventured by
stealth
to come and
see
their
princess
; but their
spirits
were
depressed
, and
their
expressions
of love and duty
consequently
cold
and languid. When
she
presented
her
son
to them as
their rightful king, they would
shake
their heads, and
cry emphatically, He is a
Christian
and a Spaniard.
Whilst
Columbus was ardently labouring to reduce
the Spaniards to
some
degree of
subjection
and order, at
the
same
time
striving
to draw the natives back to the
duty and allegiance they owed the
princess
, the
treacherous
Du Ponty, who had for
some
time worn the
mask
of
friendship
in combination with
some
of the
leaders of the banditti, had laid an infernal plot to burn
our fleet, and then, having the few that might at the
time be on
shore
entirely in their power, oblige them
to
submit
to whatever terms they
pleased
to offer.
But this plot was providentially
discovered
by a
young Peruvian maid, who, detained in the palace by
Garcias to attend on Alzira, though too young to
become a prey to any of his officers or
associates
, was
yet old enough to
detest
their actions, weep over the
ruin of her native country, and pray for
some
propitious
hour to arrive, when its enemies might be
punished
.
She had overheard Du Ponty
discoursing
with one of
his comrades on their intended plan, on the very night
before it was to be put in execution; and, waiting
till all was wrapt in
silence
,
she
stole
from her
apartment, and came to our tent. Having
disclosed
what knowledge
she
had obtained of their
designs
,
Orrabella
told her
she
should
stay
with us, and become
one of her attendants; but
she
laid her hand on her
heart and cried, No! I cannot; then looking
earnestly
in the face of the
princess
,
she
cried, Poor
Alzira
!
she
is alive;
she
is
miserable
! I will live or
die with her. Alive! my
sister
alive!
said
Orrabella
,
starting
from her
seat
; lead me to her; I will
deliver her, or
share
her fate.
The impatience of the
princess
was only to be
stayed
by the
remonstrance
of her
husband
and his father.
Your precipitancy, my love, cried Ferdinando,
may ruin all. Our enemies are now wrapt in
sleep
;
the time is favourable; we
must
repay treachery with
treachery; fall upon them
whilst
they are unprepared,
and make them
prisoners
.
This
resolution
taken, Ferdinando took a
small
boat, and, going to the
ships
, ordered from them a
number of men, who were landed at different times,
in
several
boats. The officers were informed of
Garcias's
intended treachery; the private
soldiers
and
sailors
were not told of it, left the
spirit
of revenge
might be more powerful than the
respect
they bore
their commander, and tempt them in the
first
moment
of
passion
to commit outrages at which they would
have
cause
to
blush
hereafter. Columbus
dispatched
parties to the dwellings of the principal officers;
these
parties he took the command of
himself
. Ferdinando
was appointed with a
strong
guard to
invest
the
palace
,
which Du Ponty had made his own
residence
ever
since
the night, when he put its unoffending
inmates
to the
sword
. Ferdinando knew every
apartment
,
every
secret
room in it; and the private entrance
by which the ill-fated Alzira
used
to admit her lover,
was pointed out by the Indian girl.
No
persuasions
, however urgent, could prevail on
Orrabella not to accompany her
husband
, who,
anxious
for her
safety
, and more
so
on account of her
situation
, (for
she
almost
daily expected to
present
him with another pledge of mutual affection)
earnestly
entreated her not to go,
promising
to conduct her
sister
in
safety
to herbut in vain. Orrabella was not
easily
to be
persuaded
from doing what
she
conceived
a duty. As I found her determined to go, I
resolved
to accompany her.
Through a
small
gate, at the
utmost
extent of the
garden, we were all admitted, and about twenty yards
from the
house
entered a door that appeared to be
fixed
in the
side
of a green
sloping
bank; this opened
into
an arched
passage
, which led to the cellars of the
palace, which we
traversed
with no little perturbation;
and,
ascending
a flight of
stairs
, found
ourselves
in a
spacious
hall; when the young Indian, taking hold
of Orrabella's hand, led her to the left, placing her
singer
on her mouth, in token of
silence
. I followed;
and, entering a room in the
midst
of which glimmered
a pale lamp, perceived by its
seeble
beams, an elegant
female habited in the Peruvian
dress
, kneeling on the
floor
beside
a bed, on which lay a
sleeping
infant.
Her long hair hung negligently over her neck and
shoulders
; her arms were
crossed
on the bed, and her
head
rested
between them. At the moment we
entered
,
her
sorrows
were lulled into
forgetfulness
. At
the
noise
we made, (though it would have been
scarcely
perceptible to another ear, yet
misery
is
wakeful
,
and
starts
at every
sound
)
she
raised
her languid
head, gazed
earnestly
at Orrabella, who
sunk
on her
knees
beside
her.
Sister
!
sister
!
said
she
; and,
throwing
herself
into her arms, fainted on her
bosom
.
Whilst
we were
busied
with Alzira, Ferdinando and
his followers made good
use
of their time. The
inhabitants
of the
castle
were in a deep
sleep
, partly the
effects of intemperance;
so
profound were their
slumbers
,
that many of them felt the chains on their hands
and feet, before they could recover
sense
sufficient
to
know who had put them on. Some few made a faint
resistance
; but
these
were
soon
intimidated into
silence
;
and in
such
quiet did every party proceed,
that before the dawn of day all the leaders, and a
great number of their followers, were in confinement,
and at the mercy of Columbus.
In the morning, the incidents of the night
spread
terror and
consternation
through all the
Castilian
party
;
and
those
who were
still
at liberty, readily vowed
submission
to the viceroy, in hopes by
so
doing to
secure
their lives and fortunes, as they imagined Du
Ponty and his officers would be immediately
executed
,
and their
treasures
seized
on as public property.
But in this they were
mistaken
; Columbus
wished
to
secure
his own and followers lives and properties, but
he did not arrogate to
himself
the right of plunging
a multitude of human beings into eternity,
because
they
opposed
his plans, or had been blindly led by an
unprincipled commander to perpetrate actions their
better
reason
would have
shuddered
at.
During the remainder of this eventful night, Alzira
informed her
sister
of the
circumstances
I have already
related to you. Orrabella's
soul
was in a flame at the
thought of her
sister
's
dishonour
. She
finished
her
melancholy recital in
these
words; When I heard of
your arrival, my dear
sister
, a gleam of joy
shot
through
my
bosom
; but reflection told me I had little
reason
to rejoice, for I was
dishonoured
,
stained
! and could
I hope to be
pressed
to the
chaste
bosom
of Orrabella?
Oh no! I knew I had
forseited
all right to your affection,
and I
resolved
sedulously
to
seclude
myself
from your
sight
,
suffering
you to believe I had been
sacrificed
on
the
same
night with my parents and
sisters
. Would
to Heaven you had,
said
Orrabella, fervently; for
it is a
thousand
times more afflicting to my heart to
see
you thus, dragging on a
miserable
life, with public
loss
of honour, than to
see
you covered with wounds,
and breathing out your
soul
in agony. Oh! my poor
ruined Alzira, where was the
spirit
that was wont to
animate the children of the
sun
when the wretch
first
disclosed
his impious
proposal
? Why had not my
sister
raised
her arm, and
struck
the
monster
dead?
Alas! replied the weeping
princess
, I loved him
with
such
enthusiastic
fervour, that I would have given
my own life to
preserve
his. And pity me, Orrabella;
for cruel as he has been to me and mine, I
still
do love
him
almost
to
madness
. I
struggle
with my
passion
, I
strive
to teach my heart obedience to the dictates of
reason
; but in vain. Weak, unhappy girl, cried
Orrabelia, with a
stern
look, if your heart is
so
refractory
,
ensorce
its obedience with this;
presenting
her with a dagger, which
she
always wore in her girdle.
F 2
Rash
woman,
said
I,
snatching
the dagger from
her,
just
as the trembling Alzira had extended her hand
to receive it;
rash
woman, what is it you do? Have
you forgot that the precepts of the
Christian
religion
forbid
self
-
destruction
? So, (
she
replied haughtily)
does it forbid murder, rapine, fraud, perjury, and
oppression
.
Du Ponty, I think,
professes
Christianity
.
Oh! madam! madam! the
professors
of your religion
must
practife
themselves
what they would teach others,
before you can hope to make
sincere
converts. The
argument was
unanswerable
, and I remained
silent
.
Tranquillity was now in a great
measure
restored
; it
was
resolved
the leaders of this
lawless
expedition
should
be
sent
immediately home to Spain.
Those
of their
followers
,
who
chose
to
submit
to the laws put in force
by the viceroy and governor, were to be permitted to
stay
; and when all was
established
with
some
degree
of permanency, your grandfather was to depart for
Hispaniola
. But
whilst
we were laying
these
plans, it
pleased
Heaven, by an awful and unexpected
visitation
,
to break our
measures
, and
hasten
our departure
from a
coast
, where, from our
first
landing, we had
been
surrounded
only by terror, vexation and
disappointment
.
CHAP. VIII.
Beatina's Narrative continued.
Whilst
preparations were making for two of
the fleet to return to Europe, that Garcias
and his followers might, from the
justice
of a
regular
court of judicature, receive their
sentence
, your
mother
presented
Ferdinando with a daughter, who
(by
promise
given to the queen of Spain on our
leaving
that kingdom) was
christened
Ifabelle. It
received
the
baptismal
benediction when but four days
old; for the
distress
of mind under which your mother
had laboured, had affected the health of the infant,
and its life was very doubtful.
It was nearly a fortnight from the birth of this
daughter, when as Alzira, your father, and
myself
,
were
sitting
in the apartment of Orrabella, an
unusual
drowsiness
seemed
to affect us all. The
atmosphere
had been for
some
days heavy and
oppressive
, which
at this time had
increased
to
such
degree as to
occasion
something
like a
sense
of
suffocation
; the heat too
was
intense
, though in general the climate is temperate
and
pleasant
. A torpor
seized
our
senses
, and we
sat
gazing at each other, without power to
speak
, and
with fearce the faculty of thinking. From this
stupor
we were
aroused
by a tremendous
noise
, like the
howling
of a mighty wind, the
rushing
of waters, and the
crash
of thunder. In a moment the palace
shook
to
its foundation, and in
less
than ten minutes all was
again profound
silence
. One
shock
is
past
, cried
Alzira, in
breathless
agony; another, and all is
lost
.
Oh Garcias! beloved Garcias! let me
save
you
whilst
I can. She caught up her child, who was
playing on the floor, and
rushed
toward the wing of
the palace where Du Ponty was confined.
Ferdinando
,
who had learnt from his wife the nature of
these
convulsions
of the earth, caught her in his arms; and
bidding me
haste
and follow him, bore her with
precipitation
from the palace. The two children,
Chriftopher
and
Isabelle
, were in an adjoining apartment
with their attendants. I ran to the door in hopes to
snatch
them from impending death, when the
house
again began to totter. I
saw
the apartment fall that
held the precious babes, and heard their cries as they
were
crushed
beneath the ruins. At that moment,
my
son
, who had borne his wife to an open field,
returned
,
and carried me through the falling fabric,
which nodded horror on every fide, to the
same
place
of comparative
safety
.
Two hours of
such
tremendous threatenings from
gleaming meteors,
bursts
of thunder, and contortions
of the earth, as could hardly be
supported
by human
nature, we
passed
fitting on the ground, expecting
every
moment it would open and
swallow
us, when at
length nature became more
composed
; the dark
mists
which had
obscured
the face of heaven began to
diffipate
,
and the
setting
fun darted his watery beams
across
the harbour. What then were our
sensations
, when,
added to our terror at
seeing
the whole fave of the
country a
universal
wreck, we beheld the harbour
empty, not one
vessel
to be
seen
? Columbus had gone
on board that afternoon, to give
some
orders
preparatory
to our departure for
Hispaniola
, and we imagined
that the hurricane, attendant on the earthquake, had
buried him and his companions in the waves. We
cast
our eyes towards the place where lately
stood
the
tents and dwellings of our friends and
associates
; nor
tent nor dwelling appeared; all was
silence
, all was
desolation
. A
vast
cavity was
seen
where once the
dwellings were, through which
impetuously
rushed
a
foaming torrent; which, as it roared along, bore on
its
surface
trees,
shrubs
, ruins, and bodies of wild
beasts
which had
perished
in the
tempest
.
Oh! what a night of agony we
past
. Yet this rude
shock
had not affected
universal
nature. The dews
fell as kindly, the zephyrs blowed as
refreshing
, and the
sun
arose
with as much
splendor
, as though the night
had
passed
in its
usual
tranquillity. And why not?
The whole world is but an atom floating in infinite
space
, and we who crawl on its
surface
but as emmets,
thousands
of which might be accidentally
crushed
beneath the foot of the
passenger
, without deranging,
in the
least
, the beauty, order and
symmetry
of
the
universal
whole.
When we beheld the
desolation
which
spread
far
and wide on every
side
,
despair
had nearly
seized
our
minds; but as the morning advanced, we
descried
four of our
vessels
coming with a gentle breeze into
the harbour. Columbus landed, and our meeting was
speechless
ecstacy
.
From the
devastation
of the night, about forty
souls
had
escaped
, and
these
entreated to be allowed to
embark
and quit the
coast
immediately. Columbus
having
assented
to their
request
, and had us conveyed
on board his own
ship
, put immediately to
sea
. He
then informed us, that hearing the hurricane roar
before
it came upon him, he cut the cables of his
ship
,
and ordering the
sails
to be
loosed
, prepared to put
before it, whichever way it
should
drive, as the only
hope of
saving
his
vessel
. Several others followed his
example; and providentially the
tempest
bore directly
out of the harbour.
Those
who caught the
first
moment
to put to
sea
, were
saved
; three
ships
remained
in port, and were
swallowed
in the general ruin.
Garcias and his whole party were in this dreadful
night hurried out of time into eternity. Of all the
princess
Orrabella's attendants, only Cora and her
mother were
saved
. Poor Alzira, with the virtuous
Peruvian maid who
saved
us from the vile
schemes
of the
Castilians
, were buried in the ruins of the palace.
On our arrival in
Hispaniola
, Columbus
shewed
his
commission
and authority to
displace
Roldan and his
officers, and to take upon
himself
the reins of
government
.
The natives, and indeed the inhabitants in
general, received him with acclamations of joy, and
followed the degraded Roldan to the water
side
when
he embarked, with
curses
,
shouts
and
hisses
.
Two years from this period
passed
on in the
utmost
tranquillity. The only alloy to our
happiness
at this
period, was the ill health of your mother,
whose
delicate
frame had received a
shock
almost
beyond her
strength
to
support
. But time by degrees weakened
the remembrance of her
severe
losses
; and as her
spirits
began to regain their wonted tone, health
faintly
tinged her cheeks, and enliyened her grief-
swoln
eyes.
It was at the
close
of the year 1504, that we
received
the afflicting intelligence of the death of
Isabelle
of
Spain. When Columbus was informed of an event
so
distressing
to us all, but to him in particular, he
pressed
her portrait (which he ever wore about his
neck) to his lips; Oh! my royal
mistress
,
said
he,
in the grave, with thy virtues, lies buried the
same
, the
honour, the
happiness
of Columbus. He
spoke
prophetically
;
for within
six
months from the death of the queen,
your grandfather was recalled; and Davilla, a
creature
of the king's, and an intimate of Roldan's, was
appointed to
succeed
him as viceroy. Your father,
offended at the indignity offered his parent,
resigned
all his offices, and we returned to Spain together.
Columbus never
visited
the court; but immediately
on landing retired to an
estate
he
possessed
in
Valladolid
.
Ferdinando attended the levee of the king
several
times, but he was either entirely overlooked, or
addressed
in
such
terms of chilling
coldness
, that his high
spirit
could not brook it, and he followed his father
into retirement.
Perhaps your inexperienced mind will wonder how
Roldan, but a few years
since
poor, and dependent on
the
friendship
and bounty of Columbus, could have
interest
sufficient
to
displace
that valiant commander,
and place a favorite of his own in his office. But, my
dear girl, the neglected Roldan was poor, the
returning
governor was rich. And they who in the former
situation
treated him with contemptuous neglect, or at
best
with cold,
supercilious
civility, now received him with
open arms, applauded every word he
spoke
, and, like
summer
flies round a
vessel
which contains honey,
swarmed
with a fond, officious, greedy hum, in hopes
to
share
the
sweets
that it contains.
Roldan was a man of the world; he heard them,
received their
caresses
,
smiled
internally at their
duplicity
,
made them
subservient
to his
purposes
, and then
retaliated on them the contumely and
scorn
which he
well remembered once to have received. Added to
this,
Isabelle
was dead; and Ferdinand, who never
cordially loved Columbus, eagerly caught at any
opportunity
,
however frivolous, to
disgrace
a man
whose
unexpected
successes
were a
constant
reproach to him.
Possessed
of a princely fortune, beloved by his friends,
and (even fallen as he was from power)
still
feared by
his enemies,
surrounded
by a loving and beloved
family
,
Columbus might have been expected to enjoy many
years of uninterrupted tranquillity. But, alas! his
noble heart was wounded
past
cure. It was not
power
he had coveted from the
first
; wealth he
despised
;
titles were beneath his notice; it was honour,
untarnished
and unfullied
same
, he
sought
. The one had
been twice involved in
suspicion
, and the other was
threatened to be
wrested
from him; for many of the
creatures that
infested
the court of Ferdinand,
pretended
that the
diseovery
of the
vast
continent now
called America, was nothing extraordinary; and that
many had
spoken
of it as a thing more than
possible
long before Columbus attempted it.
Besides
this, a
report was
spread
that the continent had been
formerly
discovered
by
some
mariners who were
shipwrecked
on its
coast
, and providentially returned to their native
country; that the chief of
these
mariners, being
entertained
at the
house
of Columbus's father
whilst
he
was yet a boy, he had
listened
attentively to the
descriptions
he gave of its
situation
, latitude, and
computed
distance
from Europe; that he had
treasured
this in his memory, and the old mariner dying
soon
after, Columbus had
imposed
the
discovery
on the
world as his own, the fruit of indefatigable
application
,
and
intense
study
.
These
reports, which were
maliciously
circulated by
his enemies, preyed on his
spirits
. His health daily
declined; his appetite
forsook
him, and
rest
was a
stranger
to his pillow. He
shunned
the
society
even of his
nearest
connexions; he would
spend
whole days in his
closet
, where he had carefully
preserved
his chains, and
I have often
surprised
him weeping over them like an
infant. Life became a burthen to him, grievous to
support
, and it
pleased
Heaven to
release
him from it
on the 20th of May, 1506.
What my
sufferings
were, thus deprived of my
first
and
dearest
friend and companion, it is
impossible
to
give you any idea of. For many months, I
shut
myself
from the fight of all; even the
presence
of your
father and mother were painful to me. Their
affliction
was
scarcely
less
poignant than mine, and the
most
luxurious moments any of us knew, were when we were
recounting the virtues, and weeping over the memory
of our departed hero. But from
these
tender
indulgencies
we were
aroused
by a furious war breaking
out between Spain and the Ottoman Empire.
Numbers
of volunteers, gentlemen of the
first
rank,
prepared
to repel
these
invading Moors.
Ferdinando inherited the
spirit
of his father; his
country required his aid, and
unasked
, he offered it.
During a war of
seven
years, your mother and
myself
(who remained retired in Valladolid)
saw
him but
three times. His
visits
were always
short
, and our
fears for his
safety
were
so
great and multiplied, that
the pain of parting more than counterbalanced the
pleasures
of meeting. His
last
recess
from arms was
four months, during the winter of 1514. At parting,
he tenderly embraced me. On taking leave of his
wife, who after
so
many years again gave him hopes
of becoming a father, he entreated her,
should
he not
return before the birth of his child, and it
should
prove
a girl, that
she
would have it
christened
Isabelle
. It
was the with of our late royal
mistress
,
said
he, that
one of our children
should
bear her name. She is
now no more; but the
smallest
wish
of the
patroness
of my departed father will ever be a command to me.
And to me,
said
Orrabella; if my child is a
female
,
Isabelle
shall
be her name. Your father again
embraced us,
blessed
us, and departed.
The war continued with unabated fury on both
sides
. Ferdinando was in
constant
and dangerous
service
. Six months
passed
, and no hopes of his
return
;
at the expiration of that period, you, my dear
child, were born; and in ten days after, you were
baptized
by the name of
Isabelle
.
Your mother had not left her apartment, when one
day as we were
sitting
by the window, we perceived a
courier riding full
speed
up the avenue that led to the
house
. I left the room to take the
express
, my heart
foreboding fatal tidings, and
wishing
to conceal
them as long as
possible
from your mother. But as
I went down the front
stairs
, a
servant
, who had
received
the packet from the
messenger
, ran up the
back way, and delivered it into the hands of the
unfortunate
Orrabella. She opened it,
she
read.
Ferdinando
was no more, and I returned to the
apartment
just
time enough to
save
her from falling to the
floor. Violent
convulsions
succeeded
each other; and
before morning, my poor little
Isabelle
was an orphan.
How I
supported
myself
through
such
accumulated
misery
, Heaven (who no doubt
assisted
me) alone can
tell.
It was many days before I could
summon
resolution
to examine the fatal packet particularly. When
I did, I found my brave
son
had fallen
gloriously
in
single
combat with the heir to the Ottoman
sceptre
;
that he
saw
his
antagonist
fall, and died triumphing in
the excellency of his own religion, and exhorting all
around him to
persevere
to the end. I wept at the
loss
of my child, but I gloried in his faith, valour and
constancy
in the
Christian
cause
.
From that time, my life has been a continued blank.
I have
seen
but little company. My nephew, the
marquis Guidova,
son
to a brother of mine, the
offspring
of a marriage that my father contracted after
my union with your grandfather, with two amiable
young women his
sisters
, and a charming creature
whom he had made his wife, were the only
society
that afforded me any
satisfaction
. I endure
ceremonious
visits
, it is true; but I always feel them
insupportably
tedious, and impatiently look for the moment
when the departure of my
guests
would
release
me,
and I might either unbend my mind in
observing
your
innocent
sports
, or in deep
solitude
, by reflection and
hope, be again united to
those
departed objects of my
affections, Columbus, Ferdinando and Orrabella.
In
less
than a twelvemonth after the death of your
parents, I made my will. For the contents and
meaning
of that
will
, I refer you to the beginning of this
long
epistle
, which, at hours when my
strength
and
spirits
would permit the employment, I have been
nearly three months in writing. And now, my dear
Isabelle
, I bid you adieu. May you
possess
all the
virtues of your father and grandfather, all the beauty
and fortitude of your mother, and be ever exempt
from the
sorrows
that have lacerated the heart of
BEATINA.
G
Your chief attendant was your mother's
favourite
Indian
servant
, Cora. Should
she
live till you
reach the years of maturity, be to her a firm friend;
her attachment to your parents, and affection for
yourself
, has been unbounded; let your gratitude be
the
same
.
Columbia had read, and
paused
, and wept, and
read again, till, in her anxiety for the fate of
Orrabella
,
she
had forgot what
she
so
earnestly
had
wished
to know, concerning the marriage of her mother.
The
conclusion
of the
manuscript
, however, brought it
fresh
to her memory. She turned the paper on all
sides
; no farther intelligence was to be gleaned from
that. But Cora, Cora had been particularly
mentioned
,
as
strongly
attached to the lady
Isabelle
. No
doubt
she
could inform her of all
she
wished
to know.
She had no
sooner
conceived the idea, than, folding
the papers which
she
replaced in the
escritoire
,
she
locked the drawer, and
hastily
sought
the apartment
of her aged
servant
.
CHAP. IX.
Supplication, Rejection, Compliance.
I have
read all the papers,
said
Columbia,
seating
herself
beside
Cora, who was taking her
evening's
repast
; I have read them all, but they do not
give me any account of my father, or how he became
acquainted with the lady
Isabelle
. I did not
suppose
they would, replied Cora,
sipping
with affected
unconcern
some
milk which
stood
before her, and then
breaking into it the remainder of a
slice
of brown
bread, which lay
beside
it.
Well, but dear Cora,
said
Columbia, laying her
right arm over her old
servant
's
shoulder
, and looking
with
smiling
earnestness
in her face; but dear Cora,
I dare
say
you could tell me all about it. Oh!
not I,
she
replied, putting from her with a rejecting
motion the lovely arm that encircled her neck; not
I, indeed. I tell a
story
so
badly, and make
so
many
repetitions, and am
so
tedious and minute, you would
have no patience to
listen
;
so
you and Mina may go
and walk, and I'll go to bed, and then, you know, we
shall
both be
satisfied
.
Nay but, dear, dear Cora, now don't be angry.
Pray forgive me if I was a naughty girl, and
impatiently
would not give you leave to tell the
story
your
own way. Only inform me how my mother became
acquainted with, and afterwards married to, an
Englishman
,
and a
Protestant
, and I will
promise
not to
interrupt you from the beginning of your
story
to the
end.
Aye, to be
sure
,
said
Cora, we are mighty
condescending
now. O my
conscience
, there is nothing
like
curiosity
to make a young lady gentle and
complying
.
This morning it was, Be quiet, Cora, and
pray hold your tongue. Hold my tongue indeed;
why I warrant I could have told you every thing
that happened, as well as
those
letters. But you
liked reading the letters
best
then, and
so
mayhap
you may find
some
more to-morrow that will tell you
every thing you
wish
to know.
'Tis well,
said
Columbia,
somewhat
haughtily,
I will go to my mother. She referred me to you;
but
since
you do not
choose
to comply with her
desires
,
I will from her mouth
request
a recital of events,
which, however the recollection of them may make
her own heart bleed
afresh
,
she
will, I am
sure
,
recount
,
to gratify the laudable
curiosity
of her child.
You, Cora, may go to bed and
rest
; your lady, the
daughter of the
princess
Orrabella, and her
unfortunate
offspring, will
pass
the night in
sorrow
. She in
tears of bitter remembrance, and I in lamenting
afflictions
I cannot but feel, though I have not the
power
to alleviate.
This was attacking Cora in the
most
vulnerable
part. Stay,
said
she
, catching hold of Columbia's
robe,
stay
, my dear young lady, but a few
moments
,
and I will tell you all. That's my good
Cora,
said
she
,
kissing
her cheek with affection; I
will now go and take leave of my mother for the
night. You
shall
go to bed, Mina, and I will come
and
sit
beside
you. We will put out the candle. For
you know the moon
shines
full into your chamber,
and I always think a
story
doubly
interesting
when it
is told by moonlight.
This arrangement made, Columbia went to the
apartment of her mother, and partook of a
slight
repast
. But little
conversation
passed
between them.
Isabelle
was buried in reflection, and the mind of her
daughter fully occupied by the events
she
had been
so
lately made acquainted with, mixed with a
restless
impatience
to repair to the chamber of Cora. Supper
finished
,
she
requested
leave to retire; and Mina, being
dismissed
from her attendance on the lady
Isabelle
,
they
seated
themselves
on the
side
of Cora's bed, who
eagerly began the
promised
recital.
The old lady Beatina died when your mother was
not
seven
years old, and
so
the Marquis Guidova
thought it
best
only to leave a few people
just
to take
care of the
house
and
pleasure
grounds in Valladolid;
and
discharging
the
rest
of the
servants
, take my young
lady with him to Madrid, where he for the
most
part
lived. He was a good gentleman, and his lady,
Heaven
bless
her, was as kind a gentlewoman as ever
breathed. They were as fond of your mother as
though
she
had been their own child; but who could
help loving her? She was
so
condescending
,
so
benevolent
,
so
good-natured, and more than that,
so
beautiful
.
So there was
masters
hired to teach her every
thing, that ladies of quality generally learn, and they
used
to
say
they had no trouble in teaching her; for
she
understood
every thing they told her in a minute,
and never forgot what
she
had once learnt.
Many cavaliers and gentlemen
sought
her for
their bride before
she
was fifteen. Not a family in
the Court of Spain but would have thought it a high
honour to have had her for a daughter-in-law. The
young King of Spain
used
to call her a
star
of the
first
magnitude; a gem fit for the crown of a prince, and
many other
such
pretty names. But
she
,
sweet
lady, was never made proud or conceited by
these
praises
, but was always the
same
humble, affable
creature
as ever. Then
she
was
so
pious! Ah, when
shall
I
see
her equal? Her behaviour was an example,
admired
by all, but I am afraid followed by very few.
Well, as I was
saying
, many noble gentlemen
fought to win her love, but
she
was indifferent to them
all; and at the age of eighteen, was
still
unmarried.
At that time, Sir Thomas Arundel arrived at the
Spanish
Court. He was travelling to
finish
his
education
,
and came with a
design
of
passing
a few months
in Madrid. Ah! he was a brave gentleman.
Yes,
said
Columbia exultingly, my father was
a brave man, a worthy man, an honour to human
nature.
Aye, but, replied Cora, he was much
handsomer
then,
so
tall and graceful,
such
fine blue eyes,
and
such
a complexion,
so
fair and ruddy, and his
beautiful dark brown hair fell in
such
becoming
ringlets
round his face and
shoulders
, that he looked like
something
more than mortal.
Why, Cora,
said
Mina, laughing, you
describe
his
person
with
such
rapture, that I do believe you
fell in love with him
yourself
. Heaven help me!
cried the old woman, that would have been a fine
story
truly! No, no, I knew my
station
better.
Besides
,
I was old enough to be his mother. I could
not
shut
my eyes, you know, and I hope there was no
harm in admiring what I
saw
.
No, to be
sure
,
said
Columbia, and I dare
say
my dear mother admired him as much as you did.
Indeed
she
did, replied Cora; he was
introduced
to the Marquis by the Duke de Medina, and
invited
by him to a
splendid
entertainment which he
gave to all the foreigners of
distinction
at that time
resident
at the Court of Spain. Oh! how beautiful
did my dear lady
Isabelle
look on that day; her
dress
was always plain, but it was always becoming, and
more than
usually
so
at that time. No wonder the
G 2
young
Englishman
was captivated at
first
sight
. I
could have gazed at her for the whole day without
being tired; what then
must
he feel, who had never
before
seen
a woman
so
charming? For to excel her,
I am
sure
would be
impossible
. A ball was given in
the evening; Arundel danced with your mother.
Every eye was turned upon them as they gracefully
and lightly followed the
music
. Every tongue
murmured
their
praise
.
When the lady
Isabelle
retired for the night,
she
asked
me if I had
seen
the
accomplished
cavalier
Arundel, and whether I did not think him very
handsome
.
I have been deaf to all my lovers as yet,
said
she
,
smiling
; but I believe, Cora, if Arundel
should
ask
my hand, I
should
not long withhold it. The
next morning, as
she
was
rising
, the whole of her
discourse
was on the gallant
Englishman
; and
she
could
not help
wishing
to
see
him again, and wondering
whether he thought of her as much as
she
did of him.
Whilst
she
was prattling on in her lively innocent
manner, the
Marchioness
Guidova entered the
apartment
.
Isabelle
, my love,
said
she
, I have
some
papers
in my
possession
, which I blame
myself
for not having
earlier
entrusted
to your
perusal
. Here are
some
confidential
letters which
passed
between your father and
his parents; and here is a packet
addressed
to you, my
love. It was written by your grandmother during
the
last
years of her life. It will inform you of
some
particulars in her will, which it is
necessary
for you
to know. You are there
strictly
forbid to unite
yourself
to a man who
prosesses
the reformed religion.
The Marquis and
myself
could not but
observe
last
night the pointed attentions, and
undisguised
admiration
,
with which Sir Thomas Arundel
addressed
you;
and I think it is not unlikely but he may
request
you in
marriage. Now, my dear
Isabelle
, Arundel is a
strict
Protestant
. This, you are
sensible
, will place an
insurmountable
barrier between you. And fearful that
my dear girl might let her heart be allured by an
agreeable
person
and
insinuating
address
before
she
knew the fatal
consequences
that
must
result
from
such
an indulgence, I would no longer delay
requesting
you to give a few hours
serious
attention to the
papers I here leave with you, particularly that
written
by your grandmother.
When the
Marchioness
had thus
spoke
,
she
embraced
the lady
Isabelle
, who had not once attempted
an
answer
; and laying the papers on the table, left
the apartment.
While the
Marchioness
was
speaking
, I had
retired
,
out of
respect
, to a window at the
most
distant
part of the room; but I now approached my young
lady, and found her pale, trembling, and her eyes
brimfull of tears. My fate, I fear, is fixed, Cora,
said
she
. My heart has hitherto been
insensible
to
the admiration and love I heard numbers daily
profess
for me; but though
so
lately acquainted with
him, I had,
almost
unknown to
myself
,
suffered
a
wish
to
rise
, that Arundel might be the man
designed
to be
my
husband
. It is true, I never
saw
him till
yesterday
;
but to his character I am no
stranger
. Fame
speaks
highly of his honour, integrity and
wisdom
.
But I am told our fates can never be united. If
so
,
a convent
shall
be my choice, and I will
shut
myself
from a world that will, I greatly fear, contain no
charms for me, when deprived of the hope of
sharing
the fate of Arundel.
She then
hastily
finished
dressing
, and
dismissed
me;
nor did I
see
the dear lady again, till noon. Oh! how
her
sweet
countenance was altered
since
the morning.
She was bathing her eyes in water, in hopes to take
off the
redness
; but it was in vain. The traces of
her tears
still
remained upon her cheeks, and her eyes
were
sunk
and heavy. The papers lay open on the
table before her;
she
spoke
but little to me; and
though when
she
did
speak
,
she
forced a
smile
, I
could
see
her poor heart was
almost
breaking.
The Marquis had rightly judged, that Arundel
was enamoured of my lady; for on the very next
day, he took an opportunity to call, when he knew
the Marquis was at the levee, and going into the
garden
,
as he
said
to
amuse
himself
till the Marquis's
return
,
he
sent
one of the
servants
to
desire
I would
grant him a few minutes'
conversation
. I went, you
may be
sure
; for I
guessed
his errand, and thought
it no harm to pity him, and hear what he had to
say
on the
subject
. So as I was
saying
, I went, and he
asked
me a
thousand
questions
about the lady
Isabelle
;
as whether
she
was engaged, whether
she
had ever
mentioned him, and whether it was with
dislike
or
approbation. Oh!
Miss
Columbia, he was a fine
spoken
man; it would have done your heart good to
have heard him.
Your lady is an angel, Cora,
said
he; and I
should
think
myself
but too happy to be permitted to wear
out my life in her
service
. I mean to
ask
her of her
guardian; but as I would
first
be
assured
, that by
so
doing I offer no violence to her heart, I have written
to her. Take this letter, then, my good Cora, and
deliver it into the hands of your divine
mistress
.
To-morrow
I will expect an
answer
, and my future
conduct
shall
be regulated by her commands. Be not
alarmed, (for I drew back as he offered me the letter)
be not alarmed; I
swear
to you, I have nothing but
honour in my thoughts. He then forced the letter
into my hand, and with it his
purse
, containing about
twenty ducats; and at that moment hearing the
Marquis's
voice in the garden inquiring for Arundel, I
could neither return his
present
, nor tell him of how
little effect his letter would be;
since
my lady was
restricted
from marrying a
Protestant
. But the exact
terms of the
restriction
I did not then know. So, as
I
said
, hearing the Marquis coming, I was glad to
avoid meeting him;
so
turned into another walk, and
made the
best
of my way to the
house
.
When I gave your dear mother the letter,
she
chid
me for bringing it,
she
hesitated
for
some
time; but
when I told her he
promised
to be guided by her
commands
,
she
opened and read it. Then bidding me
bring her pen and ink,
she
wrote an
answer
, frequently
stopping
to wipe off the tears that
gushed
into her
eyes.
From this time for above a fortnight, letters
passed
between them every day. My poor lady grew
pensive
, languid, and avoided company;
spent
great
part of every night in writing; and in the day time,
every moment when
she
thought nobody
observed
her,
she
would read over the letters of Arundel.
At length
she
told me one evening, that
she
had
promised
to give him an interview. He
sups
here
to-night,
said
she
, and after
supper
will retire to the
alcove on the
east
side
of the garden, and thither I
have
promised
to go to meet him; and you, Cora,
must
go with me.
I felt as though it would be right to
persuade
her
not to go, but did not know how to begin; nor could
I rightly comprehend how (as they both
worshipped
the
same
God) the differing in a few trifling forms
and ceremonies could make it
such
a crime for
them to marry. I thought perhaps the Marquis and
his lady might be angry at
first
, but that they loved
her
so
well they would
soon
be reconciled. After
this interview, the whole of which I did not hear, and
what I did hear I did not fully
understand
, only this
I know, that Sir Thomas Arundel
spoke
so
finely, that
he made me cry more than once; the lady
Isabelle
told him, that by marrying a
Protestant
she
should
forfeit
her whole fortune. And what of that, my
lovely
Isabelle
,
said
he, I have fortune enough for us
both, it is your invaluable
self
I adore; you flatter
me; I am not indifferent to your generous heart;
why then does my charmer
hesitate
? Let me call
this dear hand mine; and my wealth, which is more
than enough for all the comforts, nay, even the
elegancies
of life, will be happily employed, if it can
procure
a moment's
satisfaction
for the idol of my
soul
.
Take me not thus by
surprise
, replied your
mother
;
give me a few days to reflect
seriously
, and your
generous
proposal
shall
have an ingenuous and candid
answer
. Believe me, Arundel, I will examine my
heart with the
minutest
scrutiny
; and if I find its
attachment
to you unconquerable, I will not
insult
the
majesty
of Heaven by making
professions
with my lips
which my
soul
would
refuse
to ratify. I will then
openly, in the face of the world, avow my choice; and
if I do
so
, we will not have different
interests
in
so
serious
a concern as our
everlasting
peace in
suturity
.
No, Arundel, if I become your wife, I embrace your
religion. Your faith
shall
be my faith, your God my
God.
She then
suffered
him to
kiss
her hand, and
leaning
on my arm, returned to her apartment.
I
say
, after this interview, my lady became more
composed
; in
some
measure
regained her wonted
cheerfulness
, and the Marquis was
pleased
to perceive
a
sadness
wearing off, the
source
of which he had been
afraid to inquire into.
It was about ten days from this time, that my lady
asked
me if I would go with her to England. For
I am
resolved
, Cora,
said
she
, to
share
the fate of
Arundel. This day I mean to avow my
designs
to
my guardian, and
relinquish
my
estates
to my
cousin
.
Will you, then, follow the ruined fortunes of your
poor
mistress
?
Will I?
said
I, throwing my arms round her;
can any thing but death ever
separate
me from you?
It was towards the evening of this day, that the
lady
Isabelle
sent
me to
request
the Marquis, his lady,
and their
eldest
son
, would grant her half an hour's
conversation
. They returned for
answer
, that they
were perfectly at liberty, and awaited her
presence
in
the
saloon
. She then bade me go into the garden, where
she
knew Arundel was waiting, and bid him come to
her. He obeyed the
summons
, and they entered the
saloon
together. It was then your noble mother
declared
to her guardian and his family the
resolution
she
had taken. Had you
entrusted
me,
said
she
,
earlier with the contents of my grandmother's will, I
might have been upon my guard; but my heart was
irrevocably
gone before I knew it was a crime to love a
Protestant
. Having made my election, I do not
scruple
to
confess
, that, deprived of Arundel, I would
never
unite with any other man.
Seclusion
from the
world would have been my next choice; but
reason
and religion told me, that a heart throbbing with all
the anxieties of a
disappointed
passion
, is not a fit
sacrifice
to be offered to a Being of infinite purity. My
fortune I
resign
to my
cousin
, and
wish
him as much
happiness
in the enjoyment of it as I feel in
relinquishing
it. My
personal
ornaments I imagine are my
own. To-morrow I
shall
bestow
them and
myself
on
Arundel; and in becoming his wife, I embrace the
Protestant
persuasion
.
When my lady had
finished
speaking
,
she
gave
her hand to your father, who
spoke
something
very
handsome
, though I can't remember what. But I
know the old Marquis raved, his
son
looked quite
happy
,
the
Marchioness
cried. One moment embracing
lady
Isabelle
, and entreating her to remember her
grandmother's
last
injunctions, and not forfeit her
eternal
peace by quitting the
bosom
of the holy mother
church; then
she
would entreat her
son
not to enforce
the will to its full extent, but to be content to divide
the fortune with his
cousin
. Oh! dearee me, it was
a terrible night; for what with the rage of the one
and the tears of the other, my poor lady was
almost
distracted
.
Well,
sure
enough the next morning
she
was
married
,
and in a few days they
set
off for England. On
our arrival in London,
she
publickly abjured the
Romish
religion, and would have had me do the
same
;
but I thought changing my religion once in my life
was enough. I was taught by the good lady Beatina,
to
worship
one God, and to look for eternal
salvation
through the merits of a Redeemer; to be humane
and charitable to all mankind; and to the extent of
my weak power, I have endeavoured to
practise
what
she
taught. And I hope I
shall
, when I die, go to
heaven as well as if I had changed my religion
twenty
times.
You cannot change for the better, my good
Cora
,
said
Columbia; yet you
must
not blame my
mother.
Blame, cried Cora,
hastily
; no indeed; the
lady
Isabelle
never did any thing that
deserved
blame.
She had
sense
and education to
understand
what
she
was doing; but I was weak and ignorant, and feared
by renouncing one error, I might perhaps fall into a
greater.
Well but, Cora, what was the
cause
of my father's
ruin? He was a man of family and fortune, and though
I perfectly remember him, and recollect that I had
not
seen
him for
some
months before, I
lost
him forever.
I
shall
never forget the day on which I was told he
died. My dear mother, who had been
absent
some
days, was brought home in a
state
almost
bordering
on
distraction
. She embraced me, called me her dear
orphan girl, wept, wrung her hands, and then
clasping
them, cried, Oh! my Arundel, you are
lost
to me,
but I
trust
you are reaping the heavenly reward of
your faith,
constancy
and fidelity. She then
sent
me
from her, and a few weeks after we came to this old
Castle
. I did not half like it, Cora, nor am I quite
reconciled to it now.
Those
old ruins at the
west
end, the long gallery that leads to it, the great arched
gate-way that looks ready to fall down, and the
nasty
moat full of green water, fill me with terror and
disgust
;
and if it was not for the little garden that
Matthias
has done up
so
cleverly, and the pond where we
go to
fish
, I
should
be ready to die with melancholy.
And
so
should
I,
said
Mina, and with fear too;
for they people about here.
Now do be quiet, Mina,
said
Columbia, for it
grows late, and I want Cora to
finish
telling about my
father.
Mina was
silent
, and Cora continued. Ah! my
dear
Miss
,
these
were
sad
times indeed; it was then
your dear mother was plunged into poverty; for you
know your father was a
Protestant
. Well, he was a
favourite with our young King Edward the VIth. and
greatly beloved by the Protector Duke of
Somerset
.
They favoured the reformers very much. And there
was that wicked
Bishop
Gardiner, who was for
burning
and hanging every body that did not
say
their
prayers
just
as he did. He hated your father; and
so
he, and
several
others as wicked as
himself
, laid a
plan to take away the life of the good Duke of
Somerset
.
They
said
he had laid a plan to murder the
young King, and
accused
my worthy
master
, Sir
Thomas Arundel, of being an accomplice; and they
threw them into
prison
, and a great many more good
men were confined. And then Gardiner, and the
Duke of Northumberland, and others of his enemies,
pretended to have a regular trial. But what
sort
of
a trial was that, when the men that
accused
them were
the judges? So they condemned them all to
suffer
death, and all their
substance
was forfeit to the crown,
as they called it; but I warrant
these
righteous judges
had pretty pickings out of them. So your dear father
was beheaded on Tower Hill, and all his
estates
seized
on by
these
robbers. For I am
sure
they
deserve
no
better name; for Northumberland only took away
the life of the good Duke of
Somerset
, that he might
supply
his place about the
person
of the King, and lay
a plan for his own advantage. For he
persuaded
the
King to make a will, and appoint the lady Jane Grey,
daughter to the
Marchioness
of
Dorset
, his
successor
;
and this he pretended to do out of love to the
reformed
religion; but it was only
because
she
was
married
to his
son
, the Lord Guilford Dudley. But
Heaven
punished
him for his
wickedness
, in the ruin
and death of
those
beloved and charming children.
Oh! what a heavenly creature lady Jane was;
your mother loved her dearly. She,
sweet
soul
, did
not
wish
to be a queen; and when, on the death of
King Edward, they offered her the crown, I pray
you pardon me, my friends,
said
she
, and
suffer
me
to decline this honour; it is too much for me, frail
mortal that I am. I would
seek
an eternal, not a
temporal
crown; and much I fear the cares and anxieties
attendant on the one, will prove a hindrance to my
doing
my duty
necessary
for the obtaining of the other;
and when urged to comply,
she
bowed her head in
token
of
assent
. She
said
to
those
who knelt to do her
homage, Pray
rise
, my friends, this is mockery. You
think I am
ascending
a throne; but I
see
clearer, and
perceive it is a
seaffold
. Heaven pardon me this
H
usurpation
, for I feel I have no right to
these
honours,
and
shall
be ready, when called upon, to
resign
them
to my rightful queen.
When Northumberland told her it was for the good
of the
Protestant
cause
that
she
should
assume
the
reins of government,
she
replied, The God of the
Protestants
is all-
sufficient
for their protection; he will
not
suffer
them to be
punished
or
persecuted
,
unless
it
be for his own wife
purposes
, to prove their faith, and
bring home more to the fold. He needs not the
assistance
of my feeble arm. However, my good lord
Duke, if you think you are in the way of your duty in
heaping
these
unrequired honours upon me, I
submit
;
and Heaven forgive us both.
I have heard Matthias, who was in London at
the time, repeat her words
so
often, that I cannot be
mistaken
in repeating them again. So the
sweet
, good
lady was proclaimed queen, and nine days after,
she
was
seized
, with her
husband
and her father-in-law,
and
sent
to the tower, and
soon
after they were all
beheaded
.
And
so
I have no doubt but the wicked Duke
repented, before he died, of his malice to the good
lord Protector and your dear father; and when he
came to lay his own head upon the block, I dare
say
he
wished
he never had been the means of bringing
so
many innocent people there. The lady Jane left one
son
by lord Dudley; he was
christened
Henry; but
he bears neither the title, nor inherits the fortune of
his father, more
shame
for them that have wronged
him of it.
Here Cora
ceased
speaking
; but Columbia was
unable
to thank her, or articulate a
single
word. The
unmerited
accusation
and ignominious death of her
father, the untimely fate of the lovely and pious lady
Jane, had
so
oppressed
her heart, that it was only by
the indulgence of tears
she
could
save
herself
from
fainting. At length
she
recovered
some
degree of
composure
,
kissed
Cora, bade her good night, and
taking
Mina's hand, retired to her own apartment.
CHAP. X.
An Adventure.
It
was now near midnight. The moon, which had
shone
so
bright on the beginning of the evening,
was now enveloped in black clouds. The wind
whistled
hollow through the branches of the half-naked
trees, and the turrets of the old
Castle
echoed its
melancholy
notes. A cold rain beat
against
the
casements
,
that
shook
in their frames from the violence of
the
rising
tempest
, and every thing wore a dreary,
sombre
appearance.
I declare,
said
Columbia,
shuddering
, my
spirits
are
so
depressed
, and the apartment looks
so
gloomy
,
I
almost
wish
I had not put out the candle.
And I'm
sure
so
do I,
said
Mina, for I can't
get
those
stories
out of my head, that the people, who
live round about, tell of this old
Castle
; for I do
assure
you they wonder how we can live in it, and often
ask
if we never hear or
see
any thing.
What
should
we hear or
see
,
said
Columbia,
more than our own family? But
she
shuddered
involuntarily, and drew nearer to Mina,
casting
a
fearful
glance round the room.
Nay, I don't know, replied Mina, I never give
much ear to
such
stories
; but they do
say
the
Castle
is
haunted; and that a great Baron, who owned it a
good many years ago, killed his brother here, that he
might win the love of his lady, whom he afterwards
seduced
, and then
sent
her beyond
sea
, where
she
was
never more heard of. And they
say
the young
Baron's
ghost
often is
seen
about the
western
ruins; and
that he walks round the garden, and even
sometimes
through the long gallery and up the winding
staircase
that leads to the turret that joins this range of
apartments.
I dare
say
it is all fancy,
said
Columbia, getting
into bed, and covering her face with the bed-clothes.
Very likely,
said
Mina; for you know we
never
saw
or heard any thing.
No, nor, I will
answer
for it, never
shall
, replied
her young lady,
so
good night, Mina, for I'm
sleepy
.
Mina began to
say
, Good night; but
stopping
short
, was
seized
with a
universal
shivering
; her heart
beat violently, and
she
trembled
so
that the bed
shook
under her.
Oh heavens,
said
Columbia, what's the
matter
?
Hush
, replied Mina,
listen
. In trembling
silence
they both
raised
their heads from the pillow, and
distinctly
heard human
steps
ascend
the
stairs
, which
led to the turret, and which winded on the
side
of
their apartment immediately
against
the head of the
bed.
Perhaps Matthias is not gone to bed,
said
Columbia
.
Oh! but I'm
sure
he is, replied Mina,
I
saw
him take the candle and go into his own room.
Besides
, what
should
he do up in the old turret at
this hour, on
such
a
dismal
stormy
night?
Well, I do believe,
said
Columbia, it was only
imagination.
Just
as
she
spoke
, they heard the
same
noise
repeated, but it was the
sound
of a
person
descending
;
and
presently
a man's voice was heard, but
not loud enough to
distinguish
what he
said
.
At the
same
instant
they both
sprang
out of bed,
and
rushed
into Cora's apartment; there, as they
stood
trembling and trying to awake her, they
discerned
through a window, that looked towards the entrance
that led to the long gallery, two figures come from
the door; and by the pale glimmer of the moon
perceived
that one, by his beaver which appeared
ornamented
with feathers, was a gentleman of rank, the
other
seemed
habited like a
servant
.
There, there,
said
Mina, do you
see
? Yes,
said
Columbia; but there are two figures. Aye,
to be
sure
, replied Mina; I dare
say
that was his
faithful
servant
, who was killed endeavouring to
preserve
his
master
.
Columbia, terrified as
she
was, could
scarcely
help
smiling
at the
readiness
of her young attendant in
thus explaining every thing according to her own fancy.
They followed the two figures with their eyes, till they
seemed
to
vanish
amongst
the
western
ruins; and then
waking the old
servant
, and creeping into her bed, one on
one
side
and one on the other, related the wonderful
appearance
they had
seen
, and the
sounds
they had heard.
Cora was
strongly
tinctured with the
superstition
so
prevalent at that period in
almost
every rank. She
fully believed that they had
seen
supernatural
beings,
and related, as
she
lay trembling between them,
so
many
horrible
stories
, that the terrified girls were afraid to
open their eyes, left
some
ghastly
spectre
should
meet
their view.
At length the clock in the great hall chimed three;
and Cora, believing that at that hour
spirits
of every
kind returned to their graves,
composed
herself
to
sleep
,
as did her young companions.
But the
spirits
of Columbia had been
so
harassed
,
that her
sleep
was
disturbed
by frightful
visions
, and
she
awoke before the
sun
had cheered the face of day.
Glad to behold returning light,
she
arose
, dejected and
unrefreshed
; and throwing a mantle over her
shoulders
,
walked into the garden, in hopes the morning air
would revive her, and take off the appearance of
languor
which the want of
rest
had given her, and which
the was
sure
would alarm her mother. There, as
she
wandered through a walk of filbert trees which had
been planted by Matthias near the margin of the pond,
she
endeavoured to
persuade
herself
, that the terrors
they had experienced in the night, were merely the
effects of an imagination
previously
weakened by
melancholy
recitals, and tinctured by the
gloominess
of
the weather. The
storm
was now
past
; the
sun
was
above the horizon; the
sky
was
serene
; the air
just
sharp
enough to brace the nerves, and give
elasticity
to the
spirits
. Columbia, enlivened by its vivifying
power, had nearly
assumed
her
usual
cheerfulness
and
serenity
, when turning out of the walk towards the
house
, from an arch-way in the ruins
she
saw
,
advancing
H 2
towards her, the
same
figures
she
had faintly
perceived
cross
the court yard in the night. She
shrieked
,
drew her mantle over her face, and fell fainting to the
earth.
When
she
recovered,
she
found
herself
supported
in
her mother's arms, the
stranger
standing
beside
her.
The alarming
mystery
was now
soon
dissolved
. This
phantom, who had
so
alarmed Columbia and her
attendant
,
was a material
substance
, Sir Egbert
Gorges
by name; who, with his
servant
, flying from the
persecution
of Mary (that cruel
oppressor
and tyrant
of her
Protestant
subjects
) to the
coast
of Wales, in
hopes to
seek
in
some
foreign land that liberty of
conscience
denied him in his own, was benighted, and had
lost
his way.
Sir Egbert, thus weary and
disconsolate
, wandering
over the dreary heath, drenched by the
storm
, fatigued,
cold and hungry, made up to
Austenbury
Castle
,
which he perceived at a
small
distance
. The ruinous
appearance of the
western
wing, which, being next
the path he had taken, he
first
entered, gave him little
hope to find inhabitants in it. He made his way
through the mouldering apartments into the court
yard, which he
crossed
; and in the hope of finding
some
room more habitable than any through which
he had
passed
, he
ascended
the
stairs
which lead to the
turret. But
disappointed
in his
wishes
, he
said
to his
servant
as he came down, This is certainly a
desolated
ruin, and we had better return to the
most
comfortable
place we can find on the other
side
the court
yard. For this old turret is more
dismal
and
shattered
than any thing we have yet
seen
.
These
were
the
footsteps
and voices that had
so
alarmed Columbia.
And according to this
resolution
, they were returning
to the
western
wing, when the terrified lady and her
servant
saw
them from the window.
Sir Egbert, and his man Rawlins, having led their
horses
into a place of comparative
shelter
,
sought
for a
room that might be
best
calculated to guard
themselves
from the damp nocturnal air. Finding one
less
shattered
by the hand of time than the
rest
, they
stretched
themselves
on the floor, and
resting
their heads on
their
saddles
,
composed
themselves
to
rest
. Hard as
the bed was, Sir Egbert, worn out with fatigue and
anxiety,
soon
dropped into a profound
slumber
; nor
was Rawlins long in following his
master
's example.
From this
state
of
insensibility
they did not awake till
day light
stared
them in the face, and the all-cheering
fun darted his beams through the high-arched
windows
.
Having
seen
that their
horses
were
safe
, they were
preparing to explore the whole of the
Castle
, which
they now perceived contained
some
apartments which
wore a face of comfort, and
seemed
as though lately
repaired; when as they came from the ruin, the
first
object that met their eyes was Columbia.
Surprise
riveted them to the
spot
. But her terror on beholding
them, her
shrick
, and
consequent
fall, made them
hurry
to her
assistance
; when
just
as they had
raised
her
from the ground, Matthias appeared at the farther
end of the garden. He
hastened
towards them,
helped
to
support
his dear young lady, and by his loud
cries
soon
alarmed Mina and Cora. The fainting
Columbia was borne into the hall, and the lady
Isabelle
,
hurrying to her
assistance
, had
just
taken her in
her maternal arms, when
she
recovered
sense
and
recollection
.
The
confusion
of this
scene
had been too
great to allow of any explanations on one
side
, or
questions
on the other; but Sir Egbert
seeing
the
young lady now free from alarm, related, in as
concise
a manner as
possible
, the foregoing
circumstances
,
entreating leave to
rest
for a few days in the
Castle
,
whilst
he
sent
Rawlins to the
nearest
sea
-port to inquire
for a
vessel
bound for Holland or Germany.
To this
Isabelle
assented
; and in the
course
of the
day Columbia, half
ashamed
of her terrors, related to
her mother and her
guest
the adventures of the night.
Cheerful and
unrestrained
conversation
begets
confidence
;
and before the hour of
rest
arrived, Sir Egbert
had informed his fair
hostess
of the real
cause
of his
hasty
flight from London, and his
resolution
to quit the
kingdom.
Isabelle
was
astonished
at the account he
gave of the dreadful
persecutions
under which the
Protestants
suffered
, from the bigotry and cruelty of
Mary, and
those
tools of her power, Gardiner and
Bonner. Secluded as
she
was from the world, though
she
knew they had great difficulties to
struggle
with,
yet
she
had no idea to what height they carried their
barbarity, and that burning,
starving
, hanging, and
sometimes
drawing the victims of their
misguided
zeal
in quarters, was the method taken to bring back the
heretics (as they were called) to the ceremonies and
superstitions
of the church of Rome.
Ah! my dear child,
said
she
to Columbia, how
much gratitude ought we to feel toward the divine
Disposer
of all events, that it has
pleased
him, with a
correcting hand, to lead us into this happy
obscurity
,
where we can enjoy that liberty of
conscience
which
calms and fortifies the
soul
, and fits it for all events.
Alas! Columbia, had your dear father lived to this
day, we might all have
suffered
at the
stake
together.
Then let us be humble and
submissive
to the
judgments
of our Creator,
since
followed by the invaluable
blessings
of peace, life, and the liberty of
worshipping
him in
security
, according to the dictates of our
consciences
.
Sir Egbert was charmed with the
polished
manners
and unaffected piety of the lady
Isabelle
. But the
youth, beauty, innocence and vivacity of Columbia
had
fascinated
his
senses
. The harmonious trio parted
for the night, mutually
pleased
with each other;
Isabelle
reflecting, in pious gratitude, on her
present
happy
seclusion
from a court which
seemed
a
scene
of
murder, and where, perhaps, the morals and principles
of her darling child might have been tainted by the
bigotry and
superstition
of the times, Sir Egbert to
ruminate
on the
interesting
figure, and
sweet
simplicity
of manner that characterized Columbia, and Columbia
herself
to chat with Mina about the
handsome
Sir
Egbert Gorges.
CHAP. XI.
Girlish
Chat, Maternal Advice, Departure of a Lover.
Do
you not think our
visitor
very
handsome
?
said
Columbia. Yes, indeed I do,
said
Mina; and his man is a clever kind of body.
And you think him very
handsome
too, Mina?
No, not very
handsome
; but he has a great deal to
say
; and Cora
says
he
must
have travelled, for he
knows all about her country as well as if he had been
there. But that may be from reading, Mina; for
my mother told me to-day, that her father,
Ferdinando
Columbus, wrote a full account of her
grandfather's
voyages, during the two years they lived
retired
at Valladolid. And that at the time my father's
papers were
seized
by his enemies, the
manuscript
was
found, and it has
since
been printed.
And
so
, madam, this fine
stranger
, this Sir Egbert,
is going away to live
amongst
the Dutch people,
Rawlins
tells me. I'm
sure
, if I was as him, I would
stay
where I was. But that would be improper, Mina;
my mother could not
possibly
entertain a
strange
knight
here above a day or two, as
she
has neither
husband
or
son
to bear him company.
Well, if
she
has no
son
or
husband
,
she
has a
daughter; and I warrant Sir Egbert would
excuse
the
deficiency of the one for the
sake
of the other.
How wildly you talk, Mina; I
shall
be angry with
you
presently
. What, madam, for
supposing
the
handsome
young knight is
pleased
with you; nay, now,
I don't think you would be very much out of humour
if a
storm
was to detain him at the
Castle
a week or
so
; for then you know there would be
some
excuse
for his
staying
. Pho! you talk like a
simpleton
,
Mina; I
wish
you would go to
sleep
.
Well, I wonder how
some
folks can be
so
insensible
;
for my part, as
soon
as I
saw
him this morning, and
found he was real
flesh
and blood, I
said
to
myself
,
Well, he is a charming cavalier, and if he would but
fall in love with my lady Columbia, and
she
with
him, we
should
have a wedding, and there is always
rare doings at a wedding; and then we
should
go away
from this old
Castle
. And now, if you won't be angry,
I'll tell you the truth. I never do
say
my prayers,
but what I pray that we may
soon
go away from this
shocking
old place. Why the arch, at the entrance
of the great gate, looks as if it would fall whenever
the gate is opened; but to be
sure
that a'nt very
often, we are not much, troubled with
horsemen
,
except
when Matthias comes from market, with the old
blind crippled creature that brings home our
provisions
.
And then one never
sees
a young man. I
declare, I
blessed
my eye-fight when I
saw
Mr.
Rawlins
:
for what with Matthias's
stories
about the wars,
and Cora's earthquakes, and
shipwrecks
, and
storms
,
and
so
forth, I am heart
sick
.
And I'm
sure
,
so
am I, Mina, to hear you talk
such
a parcel of
nonsense
. However, if you are tired
of
staying
in the
Castle
, you are at liberty to leave it
whenever you
please
.
Me leave it, madam? No indeed, madam; if it
was ten times more frightful than it is, I would not
leave it without you, and my dear lady your mother,
for the whole world. No; I meant that if you were
married to this
handsome
Sir Egbert, we
should
go
to London again, and have fine
dressing
and balls and
feasting
.
You don't know what you
wish
for, Mina.
London
is no place for
Protestants
. London is now the
seat
of every enormity which is
practised
under the
mask
of religion. Queen Mary is determined that
every one of her
subjects
shall
think as
she
thinks, and
those
who
hesitate
to obey her, are burnt at the
stake
.
And pray, madam, why don't the people burn
her? She is but one, and
she
has multitudes of
subjects
.
She is their queen, Mina, and they dare not lift
the hand
against
her.
Queen indeed! Well, I am but an ignorant girl,
to be
sure
; but I can't
see
why a queen
should
commit
murder without being
punished
for it, any more
than other people.
But it is not called murder, when a
person
is
executed for acting contrary to a queen's commands.
They may call it what they
please
; but if a
person
is innocent of any real crime, and is only
accused
of not thinking as the queen does, or perhaps they
don't preach and pray
just
as
she
would have them;
I do
say
, and will
stand
to it, if
she
orders them to
be hanged or burnt, it is murder. Aye, and I fancy
her cruel
queenship
will find that out, when
she
dies.
You are a
strange
girl, Mina, and are now
talking
on a
subject
we neither of us are competent to
speak
upon; therefore let me beg you to
say
no more.
Let us
say
our prayers, and be thankful we are, by
our
seclusion
from
society
, and our
distance
from the
metropolis,
secure
from any fear of her power. And
so
, Mina, good night.
Columbia
spoke
this in
so
reserved
a tone, that Mina
did not dare to proceed, though
she
never felt
less
inclined
to
sleep
. Yet
she
endeavoured to obey her
young lady,
said
her prayers, and
addressed
herself
to
sleep
.
The next morning, Rawlins was
dispatched
to the
nearest
sea
-port, to inquire for a
vessel
, and from
some
unforseen
accidents, he was detained nearly a week.
During this interval, the daily, nay,
almost
hourly
opportunities Sir Egbert had of
conversing
with
Columbia
,
and
observing
her
mildness
,
modesty
, and
understanding
, which had been highly cultivated by
the tender and careful hand of maternal affection,
inspired
him with a
passion
ardent as it was
sincere
;
and he could not repel the
rising
wishes
of his heart,
that this lovely creature might be ordained his
partner
,
to
smooth
the rugged path of life.
Columbia had not been
insensible
to the many
virtues
and graces of Sir Egbert; but
she
had not learnt
to
disguise
her thoughts from her
best
and only friend.
She
considered
it no crime to love a worthy and
accomplished
man, and her mother became the
confidant
of her
passion
almost
as
soon
as
she
discovered
it
herself
.
I cannot blame you, my child,
said
this indulgent
parent, for the admiration and
esteem
you feel for Sir
Egbert Gorges; but I would
wish
my dear Columbia
had
seen
a little more of the world, before
she
selected
a partner for life. You are yet
scarcely
eighteen, and
Sir Egbert is
almost
the
first
man you have
seen
above
the rank of a clown. It is to be hoped, my love, we
shall
not always be
secluded
in this
solitary
Castle
. I
understand
from Sir Egbert, that queen Mary's health
is in a declining
state
. Should
she
die without
issue
,
her
sister
Elizabeth is next heir to the throne.
Elizabeth
is
herself
a
Protestant
, and will no doubt
encourage
all the
professors
of that religion. I
shall
in that
case
, for your
sake
, my child, repair to court, and
petition
for a
restitution
of your father's lands. I have
also
another duty to fulfil. A dear friend of mine,
who
suffered
death a few years after your father, in
her
last
moments recommended her infant
son
to my
care. Should
so
fortunate an event take place as the
princess
Elizabeth's
accession
to the throne, I
shall
to
her protecting care recommend this
last
branch of an
unfortunate family, the innocent part of which have
been the
sufferers
for the guilty ambition of the
rest
.
I apprehend madam,
said
Columbia, that you
mean the offspring of the Lord Guilford Dudley and
lady Jane. Cora informed me of their unfortunate
exaltation and confequent death; and I have no doubt
but the royal Elizabeth will,
should
she
ever have the
power,
restore
to him his rank and the fortunes of
his
ancestors
.
Heaven grant that I may
see
the day,
said
Isabelle
. And now, my dear child, though I would
not put any
restraint
on your inclinations, I could
wish
you to decline a union with Sir Egbert Gorges, till
quieter and more
prosperous
times. Enter into no
serious
engagements with him, which hereafter may
cause
you much
uneasiness
. Mix
first
with the world.
The heart is apt to be deceived in its
first
emotions,
when little knowledge of the world, and
seclusion
from
society
, prevents a free election; and the object who,
when the only one, appeared to have every attraction,
to
prossess
every virtue, when compared with others of
more
shining
talents,
loses
the charm that had at
first
engaged the affections. The
disappointment
then
becomes
intolerable, and the unfortunate victim of
inexperience
passes
a life of
unceasing
regret and
fruitless
repining. I will
confess
to you, that Sir Egbert has
spoken
to me on this
subject
, and I then
advised
him,
as I now
advise
you; and I hope my dear child will
not find a difficulty in following advice, that can
have no other end in view than her
happiness
.
I cannot
hesitate
a moment, my dear mother,
said
Columbia, to
promise
that your
wishes
, which
to me are commands, will ever be
observed
as laws.
Think not, beloved parent, that your child was
so
weary
of your
society
, as to renounce it for that of a
stranger
, whom
she
had
scarcely
known a week. Oh
no! however partial my heart may be, I could
wish
to be better
assured
of the merits of the object, before
I gave my future
happiness
into his keeping. Let Sir
Egbert
pursue
his intended voyage; if at
some
future
period he
should
return
still
constant
to me, I think
I can
answer
for the
stability
of my affections.
Make no
rash
promises
, my dear child,
said
Isabelle
,
Columbia bowed her head
assentingly
, and remained
silent
.
Rawlins now returned, with intelligence that a
vessel
for
Amsterdam
would be ready to
sail
in the
course
of three days. On the morning of the
second
day,
therefore, Sir Egbert, and his faithful Rawlins,
departed
;
the former having, with many thanks for her
hospitality
, taken leave of his fair
hostess
, and
entreated
her
permission
for Columbia to accept a
small
diamond
ring in remembrance of him; which, as it was
of trifling value,
she
allowed, at the
same
time
presenting
him with a plain gold one from her own
finger
,
saying
, I know you will
condescend
to accept
this in token of amity, for trifles become valuable when
we
esteem
the giver.
I
Mina had, at parting from Rawlins, received from
him a
small
silver
coin, on which with his knife he
had marked the initials of his name, and over the
letters
were two hearts. A puncture was made near the
extremity, and a
string
being
passed
through it, Mina
suspended
this pledge of affection round her neck.
But Mina, though
she
fancied
herself
in love
past
cure, and that
she
should
be
constant
through long
absence
and trials of every kind, was a
stranger
to her
own heart. She was by nature a coquette, fond of
admiration, and
pleased
with
those
gave it. She
loved Rawlins,
because
he had
prosessed
to love her.
But, alas! poor Mina, when
she
used
daily
pathetically
to lament the
absence
of her lover, had
she
but
searched
her heart thoroughly,
she
would have
discovered
that it was the flattery
she
missed
; and that food
of female vanity, artfully
administered
by any other
person
, would
soon
have effectually
banished
the
remembrance
of Rawlins, and dried up her tears for his
departure.
Far differently affected was the heart of Columbia.
Her partiality to Sir Egbert was fanctioned by the
voice of
reason
. She felt that, was
she
his
wise
,
she
could brave every
hardship
with him without
repining
.
For his
sake
she
would then have faced
persecution
,
poverty, famine, nay, death
itself
. But at the
same
time
she
forcibly felt, that to
descend
in the
smallest
legree from the
respect
she
owed
herself
, from
that
necessary
pride and dignity of manner which is
the
safeguard
of female honour, would be no longer
to
deserve
him. When engaged in
studies
that
enriched
her mind and expanded her
understanding
,
she
thought
such
employment would render her a more
pleasing
companion to Sir Egbert. He was
seldom
from her thoughts in her waking hours, and
frequently
visited
her dreams; and in her daily devotions
were mingled
constant
prayers for his
safety
.
Yet Columbia was not totally
divested
of that
vanity
,
which in her
childish
years had formed
so
striking
a trait in her character; but it had been
so
judiciously
repelled and corrected by her mother, that no
more of it remained than
served
as a foil to her virtues.
She knew
she
was
handsome
, and
she
studied
to
set
off
that beauty by humility, benevolence,
simplicity
and
candour.
CHAP. XII.
Confusion
,
Distress
, unexpected Journey.
A bove
eighteen months after the departure of
Sir Egbert
passed
in the
usual
way, in which
time Rawlins had twice been to
Austenbury
Castle
with letters from his
master
. But the enemies of
Gorges
,
encouraged by Mary,
pursued
him with
such
unrelenting
fury, that he dared not
himself
venture to
England.
It was in the
summer
of 1558, that an event took
place which had nearly put a period to the life of
lady
Isabelle
, and involved her daughter in
accumulated
misery
. A report had been circulated, that the
child of lady Jane and lord Guilford Dudley was in
existence
, and in the protection of a
Protestant
family.
The furious zeal of Mary
inspired
her with the
idea, that by getting this infant into her power, and
having him educated in the Catholic religion,
she
should
render Heaven an acceptable piece of
service
, and
entirely atone to the child for the death of his parents,
the
signing
of
whose
death-warrant
sometimes
lay
heavy
on her
conscience
; and in
those
fits of gloomy
remorse
,
she
always had
recourse
to her
ghostly
confessor
for
spiritual
advice and comfort, who upon
these
occasions
did not fail to inflame her mind, and render
her bigotry more
obstinate
.
This man, who was in the confidence of Gardiner,
bishop
of
Winchester
, encouraged the queen in her
defire
to get young Dudley into her power; and
accordingly
,
diligent inquiry was made after the place of
his
seclusion
. At length, accident
discovered
what
they had begun to
despair
of. Sir James Howard, a
younger branch of the
house
of Norfolk, (a family
renowned
for their attachment to the Catholic
persuasion
,)
a man in high favour with the queen, and in
habits of
strict
intimacy with Gardiner, Bonner, and
the
rest
of the
persecuting
party, having received an
invitation to
spend
the decline of the
summer
in Wales,
at the
seat
of Sir Owen Langwylling, and partake of
the
diversions
of hunting and
shooting
, in the
beginning
of
August
, repaired to the antique
mansion
of
his friend.
Sir Owen was young, gay, and fond of
dissipation
and
expensive
pleasures
, which the
smallness
of his
paternal
inheritance would not permit him to enjoy to
the extent he
wished
. Howard was rich in money, as
well as in court favour; and Sir Owen invited him
into Wales, in hopes the youth and beauty of his only
sister
, Winifreda, might catch his affections, and at
once
secure
an honourable alliance for
herself
, and a
powerful friend for him.
It was during this
visit
, that Howard, tired one
evening with the rude and turbulent mirth of his
host
and his
Welsh
associates
, left them to
finish
their
usual
libations to Bacchus; and mounting his
horse
, on
whose
neck he
suffered
the reins to
rest
, giving a
loose
to reflection, and intending only to
escape
from
disgusting
society
, and enjoy the
pleasures
of retirement
and contemplation, he permitted the animal to take
what
course
he
pleased
. Nor was his attention
aroused
as to the time he had been
absent
, till, coming
suddenly
out of a wood into a wide-extended heath, he
perceived the
sun
was drawing near the
western
horizon
;
and turning his
horse
with a
design
to
measure
back the path he had trod on the
summit
of a hill, he
saw
Austenbury
Castle
. The parting beams of the
sun
shone
full on the venerable ruin, and his rays gave
an uncommon
richness
to the
surrounding
prospect
.
Curiosity
urged him on, and once more turning his
steed
, he proceeded at a good pace up the hill.
It has been
observed
, that the
most
ruinous part of
this
Castle
was that which fronted the heath; and
Howard, having led his
horse
over a broken
drawbridge
,
which appeared as though it had not been
raised
for more than a century
past
,
fastened
his bridle to
a ring which had formerly
supported
a
swing
gate, or
private entrance to the fortified part of the
Castle
, and
proceeded through an aperture in the wall immediately
into the garden, the
neatness
and cultivation of which
convinced him there were inhabitants in the
Castle
.
He went forward, and at the extremity of the garden,
in the arbour before mentioned as the
scene
of
Columbia's
childish
sports
and
festivity
, he
saw
a female,
tying
up a bunch of reeds in the form of a wheat
sheaf
,
and a boy
standing
beside
her, apparently about five
years of age. As he approached nearer, the beauty of
Mina
struck
him with
surprise
. For it was
she
who
had been walking with young Dudley, who was now
become an inmate at the
Castle
, and who wanted to
go into the water after the reeds, that he might play
at reaping. She had gathered a few to divert him,
and was employed in binding them up, when
Howard
approached them. He
spoke
before
she
saw
him.
She
started
from her
seat
, and the blood mounted to
her cheeks. But Howard was young,
handsome
, and
addressed
her with
such
an air of gallantry, that
she
soon
recovered
herself
, and felt more inclined to be
pleased
than alarmed at his
intrusion
.
Night was now rapidly approaching, and our knight
was chagrined at it. He
wished
to have entertained
the pretty,
blushing
Mina with
expressions
of his
admiration
and wonder, to
see
so
much
loveliness
thus
buried in
solitude
; but time would not permit. He
asked
, however, a few
trisling
questions
, ventured to
take her hand and
kiss
it,
caressed
the child, and
presenting
Mina with a jewel which he took from his
beaver, and which he had
observed
she
eyed with
attention
,
requested
her to meet him there again early
the next morning.
But be
sure
, pretty creature,
said
he, you do
not mention having
seen
me to your father and
mother
.
I have no father and mother, Sir,
said
Mina.
Well, then, to your uncle, or aunt, or
grandmother
.
La! Sir,
said
Mina, with
simple
earnestness
,
I 2
I have no relations; I am only poor Mina, and live
here in the old
Castle
with my lady. And who is
your lady? The lady
Isabelle
Arundel.
Well, you need not tell her, or any body, that you
have
seen
me; I have a particular
reason
for it. I
will be here by
six
o'clock to-morrow morning.
Mina
promised
silence
, and dropping a curtefy,
wished
him a good night.
The thoughts of this
simple
girl were agitated and
confused
, as
she
proceeded towards the
house
. She
was
resolved
not to mention the
stranger
; but then
Henry, he might tell the lady
Isabelle
. But to prevent
this, immediately on her entering the
Castle
,
she
put
the child to bed, and then repairing to her lady, gave
as a
reason
for having done
so
, that he was tired with
his walk.
The
usual
avocations of the evening
so
entirely
occupied
Mina, that
she
had no time to think, till the
hour of retirement. No
sooner
was
she
in her own
apartment, than, drawing the jewel from her pocket,
she
compared it with the
silver
token of Rawlins'
honest
love. It is much finer,
said
she
, delighted with
its
lustre
; but then what will poor Rawlins
say
, if I
should
prove
false
-hearted? A deep
sigh
, as this
reflection
passed
through her mind,
seemed
to tell her,
the
assignation
she
had made with the gallant
stranger
was improper. But Mina
possessed
that unfortunate
position
of
disposition
, that unfits its
possessor
for
opposition
of any kind. Her inclination to keep her
appointment was
strong
, and the courtly manner,
handsome
person
, and rich
present
of Howard, had
such
an effect upon her deluded
senses
, as to lead her
to imagine
she
had never loved Rawlins half
so
well,
as
she
found
she
was inclined to love him.
Had the lady Columbia been
present
,
she
would no
doubt,
notwithstanding
her
promise
to the contrary,
have confided to her the
intrusion
of the
stranger
, and
her
promise
to
see
him again in the morning. Indeed,
full of her own
praises
which
she
had heard from his
lips, and occupied entirely in reflecting on his fine
person
and rich
dress
,
she
wished
for nothing more
ardently
than an opportunity to repeat it all to her young
lady. But Columbia now
slept
in an apartment by
herself
, and the young Dudley partook of Mina's bed;
so
the
secret
was of
necessity
confined to her own
bosom
.
Its importance in her ideas, was
sufficient
to
banish
sleep
from her eyes; and
she
impatiently
counted
the clock till it
struck
four. Well, two hours
will be
soon
past
,
said
she
, and immediately began to
dress
herself
. But quick as her impatient
wishes
led
her to imagine they might
pass
, when
she
was
anxiously
counting every minute,
she
thought the period an
eternity.
Having
dressed
herself
,
she
descended
to the great
hall, and thought to be
sure
it
must
be near five; but
poor Mina was deceived in her calculation, and found
it but a quarter
past
four. She
listened
,
she
watched
the hand,
she
could
scarcely
perceive it move; it had
certainly
stopped
; her lady would be up,
she
should
be prevented meeting the
stranger
. Impelled by this
idea,
she
had walked more than a dozen times from
the hall to the arbour and back again, and
still
it was
scarcely
half-
past
five.
At length the long expected
stranger
was
seen
approaching
;
for he had been impelled by a
curiosity
,
as
restless
as the new born
passion
of Mina, to repair
early to the place of
assignation
.
As he had
leisurely
walked his
horse
homeward the
evening before, he had reflected on the name of Mina's
lady. Arundel! It was
surely
the widow of Sir
Thomas
Arundel; if
so
, the intimate friend of lady Jane
Grey. Might not that boy be the long-
sought
offspring
of Dudley? If
so
, how would it elevate him in
the queen's favour, to inform her where the boy might
be found! Let no one blame Howard; he thought
it right to endeavour to
snatch
the child from the
dangers of what he termed an heretical education; he
acted from principle; and it were well for every one,
who courts the favour of the great, if they could lay
their hands on their hearts, and with truth
assert
the
same
.
In his
conversation
with the
artless
and infatuated
Mina, he drew from her every
circumstance
he
wished
to know. Her inexperienced heart,
fascinated
with
his flattery, and thinking him all that was amiable on
earth, could not imagine him a Catholic. She thought
he
professed
the
same
religion with her lady and
herself
.
He perceived her error, and
suffered
it to
continue
,
till he made
himself
acquainted with every
particular
within the knowledge of Mina; and in the end
triumphed in the
spoils
of her innocence.
For three weeks, an illicit
intercourse
was carried on
between them; during which period Howard had
sent
intelligence to his friend Gardiner, that the object
of their hitherto
fruitless
search
was now within their
reach. At the name of Arundel, Gardiner felt all
his hatred revive towards the widow and child of his
departed enemy; and, glad of an opportunity to wreak
on them the vengeance which the blood of the
husband
and father had not
sated
, eagerly flew to the queen,
and obtained from her an order to oblige the lady
Isabelle
,
and her daughter Columbia, with their young
charge Henry Dudley, to repair immediately to
London
;
and in
case
of
hesitation
and reluctance, to bring
them away by force.
It was morning;
breakfast
had been removed;
Isabelle
and Columbia were employed at their needles.
Mina was reading (as was the
custom
of that lady to
make either her daughter or her attendant do every
morning)
some
extracts from a book of devotion. A
violent knocking at the gate alarmed them.
Matthias
,
with all the
haste
his advanced age would permit,
went to open it. In a moment the court was filled
with
horsemen
,
solders
and friars, and at their head
was Sir James Howard, who was appointed to
command
the party, and conduct the
prisoners
to London.
Mina's heart leaped within her. She thought her
lover
was come with this noble train, to claim her as his
bride, (as he had frequently
promised
he would) and
take her with him to London. Lady
Isabelle
turned
pale.
Lost
! ruined! undone! were all the words
she
could articulate, and
she
sunk
almost
lifeless
on the
nearest
seat
.
The little Dudley was playing in the hall, when
Howard and Sir Owen entered.
Unused
to danger,
unacquainted with fear, he ran to the brave
gentlemen
,
as he called them, admired their waving
plumes and laced doublets; and hanging on the hilt
of Howard's
sword
, told him he remembered when he
came through the broken wall into the garden. This
circumstance
, which a variety of other
childish
amusements
had contributed to efface, had lain dormant in
his youthful mind, till the appearance of Howard;
who happening to wear the
same
dress
then, as when
the child
first
saw
him, brought it
fresh
to his memory.
Howard took the child in his arms; and, followed
by Sir Owen and a number of other gentlemen,
entered
the apartment of lady
Isabelle
. Though nearly
overcome by her fears, the widow of Arundel had
still
a dignity of manner, a
chaste
severity
of countenance,
that awed even the
most
ferocious. Sir Owen
Langwylling
,
a man neither celebrated for his
politeness
or
sensibility
, was a proof of this. He met the glances
of her penetrating eyes, and
sunk
abashed
behind
Howard
,
mingling in the
thickest
of the crowd, his beaver
off, and his eyes bent to the earth.
Isabelle
arose
from her
seat
at their entrance, and
bowing gracefully,
requested
to be informed of the
cause
of their
visit
. Howard was
confused
; he
hesitated
as he attempted to
speak
, and at that moment
catching the eye of Mina, who
stood
trembling behind
Columbia
,
he bowed low, to conceal the agitation that
prevented
his articulating a
single
sentence
. At length
recovering, and
obstinately
fixing his eyes in
such
a
manner as not to be able to catch a
glimpse
of Mina,
he thus
addressed
the lady
Isabelle
.
Our
august
sovereign
Mary, queen of England,
hearing that Henry Dudley,
son
and heir to the lord
Guilford Dudley, (who
suffered
with his unfortunate
lady for their attempt upon the
British
crown) is
under
your
ladyship
's protection, and
wishing
to
compensate
to the child for the enforced rigour with which
she
was obliged to treat his parents, has
commissioned
me,
James Howard, in conjunction with
these
noblemen
and
ecclesiastics
, to bring the boy to her court, that
the may
restore
to him the title and
estates
of his
father
,
and have him educated in the principles of that
holy religion, which alone leads to
salvation
.
The full conviction of the imprudence
she
had been
quilty of, and the duplicity Howard had
practised
,
how
flashed
on the mind of Mina. She gave a faint
cream, and
sunk
lifeless
to the floor.
Cora, whom the general
confusion
had brought to
the apartment,
assisted
to
raise
her, and
she
was borne
into the open air. It was not till
she
was quite out of
the room, that the lovely form of Columbia attracted
the notice of Howard. He beheld her following, with
books of the
tenderest
sensibility
, the apparently
lifeless
form of her
servant
, and in a moment every other
object
was obliterated from his mind. He
seemed
attentive
to the lady
Isabelle
as
she
spoke
, but his ears
drank not one word of what
she
uttered; nor was he
awakened from his trance of admiration, till
she
ceased
speaking
, and prepared to lead her daughter from
the room. He then endeavoured to recollect
himself
,
and
asked
, If
she
would not accompany her young
charge to London?
I thought I had
expressed
my intention
so
to do,
replied
Isabelle
, with a look of
surprise
; if you, Sir
James, did not
understand
me, I here repeat that I
will go with him. Not to
resign
my precious charge
to the queen, but to
assert
my prior right, the right
of
friendship
,
sealed
by a
most
solemn
vow, that
Henry
Dudley
should
be educated in the religion of his
patents
.
I know you will tell me there are tortures to
enforce
obedience to the queen's will; but I have learnt
to
despise
them.
Happiness
and I have long been
separated
,
nor do I hope ever to
taste
it more, till, in the
realms of
bliss
, I am again united to my martyred
friends and
husband
. Think not, then, the threats of
death can terrify me. Death is the only period I can
look forward to with
camlness
, hope and comfort.
She then
slightly
bowed her head, and taking
young Dudley in her right hand, and leaning on
her daughter with her left,
she
passed
into an inner
apartment.
In half an hour's time,
she
sent
a
message
,
intimating
that
she
would be ready to attend their orders by
four o'clock the
ensuing
morning. In the mean time,
she
requested
they would make
themselves
welcome to
whatever her poor habitation afforded.
It was late in the day before Mina was
sufficiently
recovered to be able to quit her apartment. The
weather had been
sultry
, the anxiety of her mind had
countributed to enervate her frame; and as
she
attempted
to walk, the
universal
debility and
weakness
which
she
experienced alarmed her. She thought the
air might
refresh
her.
Passing
from her chamber
through the hall the garden, the
first
object that
met her view as
she
descended
the
steps
, was Rawlins.
She trembled,
she
gasped
for breath; but
she
recalled
her fleeting
senses
, and
hastily
gliding down the
steps
,
catching his hand, in
silence
hurried him to an
obscure
part of the garden. There, as
soon
as the
tumultuous
throbbings of her heart would permit her to
speak
,
in a few words
she
unfolded to him the unhappy
situation
of her lady and family; but
shame
prevented
her revealing the unfortunate part
she
had
unintentionally
had in their ruin.
If you have any letters,
said
she
, give them
me quick, and then fly and conceal
yourself
in the
western
ruins till I can bring you
answers
, which you
must
with all
speed
convey to your
master
.
Rawlins gave her the letters, and would have
embraced
her; but
conscious
guilt made her
shrink
from
him, and covering her face with her hand,
she
waved
him toward the place of concealment, and returned to
the
house
. She
passed
unobserved
to the apartment
of her lady, and delivered the packet to the hands of
Columbia.
Fortunately Rawlins had not been
seen
by any of
Howard's party; and
Isabelle
, having
assured
herself
of this, determined by his means to
send
Henry
Dudley
into Holland, to Sir Egbert Gorges. She even
urged Columbia to fly with the child from the
perfecution
that awaited them. But that heroic girl
refused
to
desert
her mother in the hour of
distress
.
Besides
,
said
she
, the
safety
of Henry will be more
certain, when Rawlins has no woman with him, with
her fears and her
weakness
, to impede his journey.
Isabelle
, anxious to put her plan in execution, at
night-fall
sent
a
message
to Howard and his followers,
craving their
excuse
, that the preparations for the
morning's journey would not permit her to
see
them
again that night; but that
she
hoped they would not
spare
her poor
provisions
, and as early in the morning
as they
pleased
,
she
would commence her journey.
Mina, who delivered this
message
to them as they
were taking their
repast
in the great hall, led young
Dudley by the hand round to bid them all good-night;
then through an apartment, which by a private door
communicated with the
western
wing,
she
conveyed
him immediately to Rawlins, who waited till
midnight
;
and then mounting his
horse
, with the child
before him, proceeded with all
possible
speed
to the
nearest
sea
-port, where the bark he had come over in
laying ready, he went immediately on board, and
prevailed
on the
master
, by
promises
of a large reward, to
put directly to
sea
.
The fortitude Mina had been obliged to exert in
the execution of this plan was
almost
too much for her
frame to
support
. The facing the perjured Howard,
and delivering to him a
message
from her lady, the
taking what
she
firmly believed to be a
last
farewel of
Rawlins, were excruciating trials. But
she
thought
the
severest
sufferings
were too little to atone for the
mischief
she
had brought on the
house
of Arundel;
and the
consolatory
reflection that
she
had been the
means of
saving
one innocent victim from the power
of Mary, having
shed
a temporary calm over her
soul
,
she
enjoyed a few hours
repose
, which in
some
degree
enabled her to
support
the
confusion
of the
ensuing
day.
By three o'clock, Howard and his followers were
in motion.
Isabelle
heard them, and awaking
Columbia
and Mina, who that night both
slept
in her chamber,
they equipped
themselves
for their journey. Their
clothes had been
previously
packed the night before,
and
sent
down
stairs
.
As the clock
struck
four, the widow of Arundel,
with her daughter and attendant,
descended
the great
stair
-
case
into the hall. Howard received them at the
foot of the
stairs
; but not perceiving the child,
eagerly
inquired for him. He is gone,
said
Isabelle
,
with a dignified
composure
; but that he has
escaped
is not your fault. I have
sent
him out of the reach of
bigotry and cruelty, and am now ready to go and
answer
to the queen for my crime. It is I, I only, that
am guilty, if guilt it can be termed. And I do
entreat
you, Sir James Howard, and you, holy fathers,
whose
profession
is peace and mercy,
suffer
not
these
children to be
insulted
or
punished
for my faults. To
you, Sir James, I
solemnly
commit the
safety
of my
daughter; that young woman is her attendant.
Attached
to her from
almost
infancy, I do
beseech
you
let them not be
separated
. Your family is noble, you
wear the badge of a
soldier
; I
should
hope you would
neither
disgrace
the one or the other by injuring
unprotected
women, whom ill fortune only has thrown
into your power. Now I am ready to
set
forward,
and Heaven be my
support
.
The
majesty
of her manner as
she
spoke
, awed them
into
silence
. Sir James Howard, confounded by the
pointed rebuke
she
had innocently given him, when
she
recommended her daughter to his protection, had
not power to
answer
; nor was it till they had
proceeded
a
considerable
way on their journey, that they
began to
consider
the very
foolish
appearance they
should
make at the court of Mary without Henry
Dudley, who had been the chief object of their
excursion
.
During the journey, which the
badness
of the roads
and the heat of the weather rendered fatiguing and
tedious in the extreme, Howard let no opportunity
K
pass
in which he thought he could effectually pay his
court to Columbia. But the
confession
of Mina (who
on the
first
night after their departure from
Austenbury
Castle
, had on her knees to her
astonished
ladies
revealed the whole of her imprudence, and Howard's
seductive
arts) would have effectually
steeled
her heart
against
him, had there been no other motive for her
rejection. But with
such
a woman as Columbia, the
levity and unmeaning gallantry of Sir James Howard
could make no
impression
on her heart;
especially
when it is remembered
she
had been
previously
awakened
to
sensibility
by the
intrinsic
merit of Sir Egbert
Gorges.
Isabelle
and her daughter bore the journey better
than could have been expected, and on the tenth day
from the commencement of it, they arrived in
London
.
Mina had drooped from the beginning, and was
on their arrival
so
ill, from
satigue
and grief, that
there
seemed
but little hopes of her recovery.
The old
servants
, Cora and Matthias, were left in
the
Castle
, heart-broken for the departure of their kind
and beloved
mistress
. Their
solitary
days were
passed
in enumerating her virtues, and in offering up
prayers
for her
safe
and
speedy
return.
CHAP. XIII.
RevolutionTranquillity
restored
.
On
the arrival of
Isabelle
and her daughter in
London, they were committed to
close
consinement
;
though by the care of Howard,
whose
power
kept the
ecclesiastics
at a
distance
, they were treated
with
respect
.
The
ensuing
morning
Isabelle
was ordered to attend
the queen. With a
most
threatening
aspect
did Mary
interrogate her on the
subject
of Henry Dudley's
escape
,
and demanded to know where
she
had
sent
him.
The widow of Arundel was inflexible. She only
replied
,
that
she
had
sent
him to a place of
safety
; that
in
so
doing
she
only conceived
she
had performed her
duty,
since
, being
herself
convinced of the errors of
the Catholic
persuasion
,
she
had given by letter a
solemn
promise
to his dying mother, that
whilst
she
lived,
Henry
should
be carefully
instructed
in the tenets of
the reformed religion.
Irritated beyond
expression
by the noble
firmness
,
which the termed
obstinacy
, of the lady
Isabelle
, Mary
commanded her from her
presence
; at the
same
time
giving orders for her to be put to the torture, to force
a
confession
from her. But Gardiner, who was
present
,
and conceived this would be an impolitic
measure
of the queen's, humbly entreated a few days might be
allowed for reflection. Perhaps,
most
gracious
sovereign
,
said
the
designing
prelate, your royal
clemency
may have a more powerful effect on the
generous
mind of lady Arundel, than rigour; and the
power of gratitude may draw from her a
secret
,
which the
most
cruel tortures might not effect.
Isabelle
was preparing to
speak
again, but
Howard
,
who feared
she
might too far irritate the queen,
and trembling for the fate of Columbia, hurried her
out of the
presence
. Having committed her to the
guards, who waited to
reconduct
her to prion,
he returned to the queen, and informed her of his
passion
for the daughter of the haughty
Isabelle
.
She is young, royal madam,
said
he, and if I can
judge of her
disposition
by her countenance, might be
easily
converted to the true religion; for
she
appears
all compliance, affability and
gentleness
. Permit
me to try to bring her over to our party. When
once convinced of the errors of the faith
she
now
professes
,
it will become a point of
conscience
with her
to retrieve young Dudley from his
present
lost
state
.
I
suppose
this girl is
handsome
?
said
Mary.
I
should
call her
superlatively
so
, had I never
seen
your
majesty
, replied Howard, bowing profoundly.
Mary, though at this period
past
her forticth year,
naturally plain in her
person
, and now more than ever
so
from the ravages of a
desease
which daily gained
ground and began to give
some
very alarming
symptoms
,
was
still
open to the voice of
stattery
. The
compliment of Howard had an
instantaneous
effect on
her temper. She
smiled
, and told him
she
would
see
this paragon. I will
converse
with her
myself
,
said
she
, and endeavour to draw her by
persuasive
arguments to the true faith. But if I fail, let her and
her proud mother beware. Her beauty
shall
not
save
them; they
shall
submit
to the
punishment
appointed
for
obstinate
heretics.
Columbia had
suffered
almost
a martyrdom in the
absence
of her mother; a
thousand
fears had
distracted
her. Sometimes
she
imagined
she
should
never
see
her again; that the furious queen, provoked by her
refusal
to
discover
the retreat of Henry Dudley,
would doom her immediately to the
stake
; then
would
she
wring her hands, and utter the
most
piercing
lamentation, in which
she
was joined by Mina,
whose
distress
was the more poignant, as it was mingled with
self
-
accusation
. At length
she
beheld her return, and
her joy was for a few moments as wild as had been
her
sorrow
.
Isabelle
was convinced within her own mind, that
the hour drew near in which
she
would be called upon
to
seal
her faith with her blood, and endeavoured to
arm
herself
with patience and fortitude for the
expected
trial. Every
hasty
step
she
heard, every
unusual
noise
that
issued
from the
street
,
she
imagined was
the
messenger
of her fate. But
she
carefully concealed
these
thoughts from her daughter, thinking to
save
her the
misery
of hourly expecting an event that
would leave her an unprotected orphan, and which,
however
she
might lament,
she
had no power either
to prevent or retard.
They partook but
sparingly
of a
repast
that was
brought them, when
Isabelle
endeavoured to divert
her own and Columbia's melancholy by
conversation
;
at the
same
time
selecting
those
subjects
which might
tend to
strengthen
and fortify their minds
against
impending
misfortune.
The afternoon was not more than half worn, when
Howard arrived with the queen's mandate for
Columbia
to repair forthwith to the palace. It was then the
tender mother had need of all her fortitude. In vain
she
pleaded to be permitted to go with her child; it
was contrary to the commands of Mary.
Finding entreaty
fruitless
,
she
embraced her with
tenderness
, and
said
, Remember, my child, thy
mother's
happiness
depends on thee. Oh beware! Suffer no
temptation, however great, to draw thee from thy
duty
to thy Creator. No, Columbia, not even to
save
the life of thy mother, let thy faith be
shaken
. If I
must
suffer
, let me at
least
have the
consolation
of
reflecting
,
in my
last
hours, that my child preferred
misery
to
apostacy
.
Fear me not, beloved parent, replied Columbia,
returning
her embrace, I can never forget the noble
examples of
firmness
and
resolution
set
me by my
ancestors
;
and if the remembrance of
those
should
fail to
animate me, I will think that my failure in
so
important
a point would call a
blush
into the face of my
mother; and that would give me
strength
to
withstand
all temptation, however alluring, and
desy
all
threats, all tortures, however terrible to human nature.
Pray for me, my mother, pray for your poor child. She
sell
on her mother's neck, and
sobbed
aloud.
Howard
re-
assured
them, by pledging his
solemn
word, that
no evil was intended; and taking her reluctant hand,
led her from her mother into the
presence
of the
queen.
Columbia, though endowed with all the rigid
virtues
that
so
eminently adorned her mother, yet had
an appearance of more
softness
; and the awe a young
person
, totally unacquainted with the forms of courts,
as well as of the world in general, might be
supposed
to feel on finding
herself
in the
presence
of her
sovereign
,
and that
sovereign
incensed
against
her, gave
her an air of timidity and humility highly gratifying
to the pride of Mary.
The queen
questioned
her concerning the departure
of young Dudley. He went away with a
servant
K 2
belonging to a particular friend of my mother's,
said
she
, who
wished
me to have gone too, but my love
for the
best
of parents, and my
conscience
, which told
me I
should
be wanting in filial duty, prevented my
embracing the
proposal
.
Conscience
?
said
Mary, fiercely, the
conscience
of a heretic cannot be
supposed
very tender; tell me,
are you not a heretic?
I do not
understand
the meaning of the
appellation
,
replied Columbia mildly.
I will endeavour to explain it to you,
said
the
queen; come, child, be not alarmed. I will talk
with you a little on religious matters. Your
ignorance
is really pitiable, but it is more your misfortune
than your fault.
I humbly pray your
majesty
to pardon me,
replied
Columbia; I am a weak girl, and totally
inadequate
to the
task
of
speaking
on
so
reverend a
subject
,
especially
before a
person
of your
majesty
's
superior
understanding
and
extensive
erudition I have
hitherto lived a peaceful, happy life, unknowing and
unknown; where, to the extent of my abilities, I have
endeavoured,
strengthened
as I was by the example
of a
respectable
mother, to
discharge
my duty both to
my Creator and my fellow creatures. I
beseech
your
majesty
,
suffer
me to return to that calm retirement,
where the remainder of my days may glide on in
obscurity
,
and my name
pass
quietly into oblivion.
I fear,
said
Mary, you entertain erroneous ideas
of your duties, both moral and religious. Your faith
and mine are different. Columbia was
silent
. I
will appoint
some
holy men to
visit
your mother in
her retirement, continued the queen, and they
shall
also
instruct
you in the tenets of our holy church.
Are you willing to be
instructed
and converted?
I am willing to be
instructed
by wife and good
persons
, replied Columbia; I will
listen
to them
with patience; and if my
reason
is convinced
It
must
, it will be convinced,
said
the queen,
eagerly,
unless
you wilfully
shut
your eyes and ears.
And that I hope I never
shall
do,
said
Columbia
,
fervently,
against
the light of truth.
Mary was
satisfied
, and
dismissed
her, and
she
was
conveyed by the guards to the arms of her impatient
and anxious mother.
Both Howard and the queen from this interview
entertained
sanguine
hopes of converting Columbia.
They did not perceive that all her
answers
were
ambiguous
,
and might have been explained in a very
different
sense
than the one they took them in.
Howard
seized
the favourable moment of the
queen's good humour, to
request
the charge of the
prisoners
might devolve on him. I have a
house
,
most
gracious
sovereign
,
said
he, not far from
London
;
some
of the apartments have heretofore been
used
as a
state
prison
. Suffer me to convey the widow
of Arundel and her daughter thither; I will
answer
for their being kept in
safe
custody
, with my life. In
the mean time, my
confessor
, with whatever other
ecclesiastic
your
majesty
may
please
to appoint, can
visit
them every day.
I
see
,
said
the queen with a half
smile
, you
wish
to have an opportunity of
prosecuting
your
suit
to the
fair daughter of Arundel without interruption. Well,
be it as you
desire
; into your charge I commit them,
and at the hazard of your head, continued
she
,
sternly
,
be they forth coming whenever I demand them.
For by the crown of my
ancestors
I
swear
, they
shall
not
escape
my vengeance,
unless
they renounce their
heretical opinions, and give up young Dudley to my
power.
Howard,
pleased
that by this manuvre he had got
the
person
of Columbia entirely in his power, thanked
the queen for her
condescension
, reiterated
promises
of
not permitting them to
escape
, and
hastened
to the
place of their
consinement
, where he informed the lady
Isabelle
and her daughter, that he had prevailed on
the queen to let him remove them to a
mansion
of his
own, not far from London. You will there,
said
he, have the benefit of the air, and the indulgence of
sometimes
exercising
yourself
in the garden. But I
have obtained this favour at the hazard of your
displeasure
;
for I have
promised
the queen that you will
daily
converse
with
ecclesiastics
of the Catholic
persuasion
.
Your patience one moment, dear lady,
seeing
Isabelle
was about to reply, it is what you
must
submit
to if you remain here. Let me on my knees
entreat you, then, to
suffer
me to convey you, and
this angel your daughter, out of the reach of the
tyranny
of Mary.
Whilst
you remain
secluded
in her
palace, the
instruments
of her power may, in the dead
of night,
rush
in and
sacrifice
you to her vengeance;
put under my roof you will at
least
be
secure
from
sudden
insult
and
surprise
, and
should
she
menace your
precious lives, I will
preserve
them at the hazard of
my own.
Howard,
said
Isabelle
, I would
sain
believe
your
professions
are
sincere
; but when I remember who
betrayed us into the power of the queen, how can I?
This was the
first
moment Howard had
suspected
that Mina had
discovered
his frequent
visits
at
Autenburg
Castle
. He had
strove
several
times, during
their journey, to draw her apart from her ladies, but
in vain. She had always carefully avoided him. But
this he thought proceeded from her fears of awakening
suspicion
; nor did he once imagine
she
would confide
an
intercourse
, that would appear
so
much to her
disadvantage
,
to the ear of a woman
so
rigidly virtuous
as
Isabelle
. It is true,
Isabelle
was rigid in her own
practice; but
she
always made a
just
distinction
between
the errors incident to human nature, and
premeditated
guilt. For the folly of Mina,
she
found an
excuse
in her
simplicity
, and ignorance of the world;
but for the art and
seduction
practised
by Howard,
she
felt only contempt and horror.
What reliance, continued
she
,
stedsastly
fixing
her eyes on his face, what reliance can I place on
the word of a man, who by flattering
promises
drew
an
artless
, innocent girl to her ruin,
whilst
from the
openness
of her
unsuspecting
nature, he learnt
secrets
, the
divulging of which has plunged her only friends and
benefactors in unavoidable
destruction
?
The cheel of Howard glowed with the
crimson
tint
of
shame
. The penetrating eye, the forcible voice of
Isabelle
,
sunk
to his heart.
I have been to blame,
said
he, in accents
scarcely
audible, but do not too
hastily
condemn me.
Allow
something
to the
impetuosity
of youthful
passion
;
and if, betrayed by an
enthusiastic
partiality to
the religion in which I was educated, I
hastened
to
inform
my
sovereign
where
she
might find the offspring
of Dudley and lady Jane, let it be
some
expiation of
my error, that I am
severely
punished
in having
unintentionally
involved two ladies in misfortune, who, to
every grace that can excite admiration, unite every
virtue that
should
command
esteem
. Let not, I
beseech
you, the
discovery
of my errors blind you to
what is
absolutely
necessary
to your own
interest
and
safety
, nor, by
obstinately
refusing
the
asylum
I offer,
heap
fresh
guilt upon me, by making me in a manner
accessory
to your death, and that of your lovely
daughter. The beauty and innocence of the fair
Columbia
have already awakened in the
breast
of Mary
a malignant
spirit
, which
she
will be glad to gratify
by
sacrificing
her to her pretended zeal; for your
daughter has already
expressed
her attachment to the
reformed religion, in terms too pointed to be
overlooked
.
Another interview with the queen, and
she
will be
lost
beyond recovery.
Howard
paused
for an
answer
. The mind of
Isabelle
was in a
state
of agony. Her own life would
have been nothing;
she
would have
despised
the
protection
of Howard, and undauntedly braved the
power
of the queen; but her child, her darling Columbia,
her fate, perhaps, hung on her
answer
. She was
within
the reach of the bigotted queen, Howard might
protect
,
might
save
her. What mother, in
such
a
case
,
could
hesitate
?
Isabelle
bowed her head, and, in a voice tremulous
through fear and
stifled
indignation,
assented
to his
proposal
. A
short
time
sufficed
for preparation, and
that very night they
slept
in the
house
of Howard,
at
Hamstead
, if
sleep
it could be called, when to their
other anxiety was added the
disappearance
of Mina.
She came with them to the
house
, retired after they
had taken
some
refreshment
, and when the hour of
rest
arrived, was not to be found. Howard was
suspected
by
Isabelle
, but Howard had departed with the
setting
sun
, and could not be
questioned
.
At the
first
appearance of day, Columbia
arose
;
and for the
first
time, eagerly counted the hours that
would
most
probably intervene before
she
could hope to
see
Howard. The morning wore heavily away;
Isabelle
was dejected and
uneasy
; her daughter endeavoured
to hide her own painful
sensations
, that
she
might
divert
the anxiety of her mother.
About noon, their attention was
aroused
by the
entrance
of two
ecclesiastics
, who were appointed by
the queen to
visit
, exhort, and endeavour to convert
the two
priseners
.
Isabelle
heard them in
silence
.
Columbia was
several
times on the point of replying;
but a reproving look from her mother
repressed
her
thoughts before her lips could give them utterance.
At the
conclusion
of the conference, the widow of
Arundel ventured to inquire of
these
religious men
they had any knowledge of the fate of Mina; but
she
received from them a
stern
reproof, and was bid
to think more of eternal and
less
of temporal things,
as her
destiny
was as yet undetermined, and it
remained
with
herself
whether a few days would rein
state
her in her late
husband
's forfeited
estates
and
property, or
sign
the mandate for her death.
When the
priests
left her, the fortitude of
Isabelle
seemed
entirely to
forsake
her. She threw her arms
and the neck of her daughter, and gave way to an
involuntary
gush
of tears. Columbia, unprotected,
dependent on the bounty, and liable to be
ensnared
by
the artifice of Howard, was pictured to her
imagination
in colours
so
strong
, that
she
could not
support
the idea.
Thus
miserably
did day after day wear on,
diversified
only by the tedious exhortations of the monks,
and the agonizing feelings of
suspense
and
apprehension
.
A fortnight was now
past
, and they had not
once
seen
Howard. They were attended with
respectful
assiduity
; they had but to name a
wish
, and it
was
instantly
complied with. And only that they
were not permitted to
pass
the boundaries of the
garden
wall, their
situation
might have been thought
enviable
.
The charms of autumn were now beginning to fade,
and winter was rapidly approaching, when one
evening
,
after a chilly walk to the extremity of the
avenue
of ancient elms that fronted the
house
, as
Isabelle
and her daughter were
sitting
down to their
repast
,
experiencing
some
small
degree of comfort, in the
neatness
of their apartment, and the cheerful blaze of
a wood fire that glowed on the hearth, they were
startled
by a loud knocking at the gate, and in
less
than two minutes Howard
stood
before them. Spite
of the
reasons
they had for
disliking
him, yet their
long
seclusion
from all
society
, (except the
persecuting
zealots who daily
visited
and tormented them) the
many comforts they had through his means enjoyed,
and the
earnest
wish
they had to inquire after the fate
of Mina, gave to their countenances an air of
pleasure
that was not altogether foreign to their hearts.
Isabelle
arose
from her
seat
as he entered; Columbia
advanced
two or three
steps
towards him, and half
extended
her hand to welcome him.
These
tokens of
joy at his appearance, thrilled to the enraptured heart
of Howard. He eagerly
sprang
forward, caught the
half-reluctant hand, and, dropping on one knee,
imprinted
on it a fervent
kiss
. The action recalled their
momentarily forgotten dignity; the features of
Isabelle
assumed
their
usual
srigidity
. Columbia
blushed
scarlet
deep, and putting him from her with a rejecting
motion,
Rise
, Sir,
said
she
, nor, by affected
humility
,
insult
your
prisoners
.
Howard now
hastened
to inform them, that,
anxious
only for their
safety
, he had been
assiduous
in his
court to the queen, and, bribing the
priests
to conceal
the ill
success
of their endeavours, he had
persuaded
Mary that there was more than probable hopes of
their
conversion
. But I fear, continued he, I
shall
not long be able to elude her
suspicious
vigilance.
She this afternoon hinted
something
of recalling you
to London, examining you
herself
, and accordingly
as
she
found you inclined, either receive you into the
bosom
of the church, or give orders for your
immediate
execution.
Then our fate is inevitable,
said
Isabelle
, with as
much
firmness
as
she
could
assume
. Columbia
cast
a
look of unutterable
tenderness
at her mother, and,
gasping
to
suppress
the
anguish
of her heart, cried,
Yes, my mother, we will die together.
Not
so
,
said
Howard,
struck
with the
magnanimity
of the two charming women; not
so
. My
employment at court, which places me
almost
immediately
about the
person
of the queen, gives me an
opportunity of knowing her
designs
almost
as
soon
as
she
conceives them. I will attentively watch her;
not a command
shall
be
issued
forth of which I will
not learn the motive and intent; and
should
I find
her aim at the lives of my lovely, my
esteemed
prisoners
,
I will deliver them from her power, or die in their
defence.
Isabelle
ejaculated an
expression
of gratitude, and
Columbia, in tremulous accents, ventured to inquire
after Mina. But Howard, with a look of
surprise
,
protested
his entire ignorance of her
absence
in terms
so
positive
, that it appeared
impossible
any longer to
doubt his veracity.
The remainder of the evening was
spent
in
social
converse
. He inquired if they had all the
accommodations
they
wished
, and if their commands had been
readily obeyed by their attendants? On taking leave,
he
requested
them to be
constantly
ready for a
removal
,
as he
should
take care to give them early notice of
impending danger, and provide them with
horses
and
attendants to facilitate their
escape
.
After this
visit
, their time was
passed
in the
usual
way, till the morning of the
seventh
of November;
when,
just
before day, Howard arrived, attended by a
numerous retinue, and, hurrying
Isabelle
and
Columbia
from their beds, told them the moment
so
long
dreaded was at hand, and nothing but immediate
flight could
save
them. They
arose
with
precipitation
,
and mounting the
horses
that
stood
ready for
them, proceeded, with all the expedition their
strength
would permit, to the borders of the kingdom next the
sea
on the
coast
of Suffolk, where, in a mutilated
fortress
,
(a very
small
part of which was habitable)
Howard
requested
them to
repose
, till, as he
said
, a
vessel
should
arrive, the
master
of which had orders to meet
them there, to convey them in
safety
to Holland,
Germany
,
or
some
place of
security
.
Fatigued,
dispirited
, and ill,
Isabelle
attended but
little to the
desolate
appearance of their habitation, or
the few accommodations they were likely to meet with
in this
solitary
place. A numerous
assemblage
of
male
domestics
had attended them on their journey;
but they
saw
only one female throughout the whole
dreary
mansion
, and
she
was
almost
insensible
through
age and infirmity, being quite deaf and nearly blind.
However,
she
performed the
most
menial offices, and
Isabelle
was too intent on the
miseries
of her
situation
,
and the danger to which Columbia would be
exposed
,
should
they be
discovered
and forced back to the court
of Mary, to feel any of
those
inconveniencies, which
in her more
prosperous
days would have appeared
intolerable
.
All hope of a departure from England during the
winter
season
soon
vanished
; the weather became
uncommonly
tempestuous
, the
snow
fell in great
quantities
,
and the
frost
was
intense
. Howard was the
constant
inmate of their gloomy
mansion
; for, under
pretence that his life was in danger on account of his
having aided their
escape
, he
secluded
himself
with
them, and declared his intention to accompany them,
whenever the weather would permit them to depart.
During the dreary months of December and
January
,
he endeavoured, by
amusing
conversation
, and a
display
of the various
accomplishments
of which he
was
master
, at once to divert the melancholy of the
lady
Isabelle
, and awaken the attention of Columbia.
But he
presently
perceived his endeavours were
inefeffectual
;
L
the
despondency
of the mother daily
increased
,
till it
almost
bordered on
despair
, and every
tender emotion of the daughter's heart was excited by
hope, fear, and
constant
anxiety for the fate of the
absent
Sir Egbert Gorges.
This
discovery
once made, it became the
business
of
Howard to undermine a
passion
which militated
so
powerfully
against
his
success
. To this end, he
frequently
pretended to receive private news from
London
,
and
amongst
other incidents, related one day, in
a
seemingly
careless
manner, that a number of heretics
had been executed, naming
several
, and at
last
Sir
Egbert.
Columbia was
present
; he eyed her attentively.
She did not
shriek
,
she
did not faint; but the blood
forsook
her lips and cheeks, her heart beat violently,
she
raised
her
sweet
eyes mournfully to his face, and
attempted to
ask
a confirmation of the fatal tidings.
But the words died upon her tongue;
she
struggled
in
vain to give them utterance; her voice was
inarticulate
.
She
clasped
her hands, leaned her head on her
mother's
shoulder
, and large tears rolled in
slow
and
silent
succession
down her cold cheeks. Such mute
grief,
such
signs
of real
anguish
, moved the heart of
Howard. He attempted to comfort her; but
Isabelle
waved him from the apartment; when taking her
daughter tenderly in her arms,
she
soothed
,
consoled
,
and
sympathized
with her, till her tears flowed more
freely, and by degrees
she
became
composed
.
Howard had always been open in his declaration of
love for Columbia; it was therefore not
surprising
that
he continued his
suit
, or that, being thus
constantly
in
her
society
, he
should
plead his
passion
with more than
common fervour. She in general heard him in
silence
;
but if
pressed
to
answer
, her reply was always
that her heart was dead to affection.
He applied to
Isabelle
;
she
urged the difference of
their religions, even was Columbia inclined to favour
him. He
promised
she
should
never be
disturbed
in
the free
exercise
of her religious duties, according to
what
she
thought right; and
Isabelle
, worn out by
constant
anxiety, feeling her health daily decline,
firmly believing Sir Egbert Gorges dead, and
wishing
to
secure
for her child a noble and powerful protector,
at length
seemed
inclined to
listen
to him, and to plead
his
cause
with Columbia.
The advice and
reasonings
of her mother ever had
due weight with this amiable girl; and though
whenever
her parent mentioned, that in all human
probability
,
a few months would put a period to her
existence
,
she
would mentally offer up a prayer, that her
own life might terminate in the very
same
moment
with that of her maternal friend. Yet as
she
saw
her
mother
secretly
wished
to
see
her united to Howard,
she
endeavoured to
dispose
her mind for
such
a union,
tacitly
consented
to
listen
to his
suit
, and at the
commencement
of the
ensuing
summer
, to give him her
hand.
With
slow
and tardy
steps
winter receded; and
spring
began to
show
her
smiling
face, and wreath her
modest
brows with
snow
-drops,
crocuses
, and
primroses
.
All nature
seemed
to wear a cheerful
aspect
;
but the heart of Columbia partook not of the hilarity
the vernal
season
was ever wont to
inspire
. If at any
time
she
seemed
to enjoy a gleam of
satisfaction
, it
was when
she
was wandering through the woods,
remarking
the daily
increase
of the foliage, or
seated
on
a rock by the
sea
-
shore
,
listening
to the
sullen
murmur
of the waves, or watching them as they
constantly
succeeded
each other,
dashing
against
the rude crags
that hung frowning over their
source
.
It was about the middle of May; the lady
Isabelle
had declined walking, though the evening was
remarkably
fine. Howard had been
absent
from the
Castle
two days; his
absence
was a relief to the
dejected
spirits
of Columbia. She took her
solitary
ramble through the wood. The fragrance of the
evening air, the
serenity
of the
sky
, the melody of the
feathered race who were chanting their
vesper
song
of
thankfulness
, awakened in her
bosom
something
like
cheerfulness
. She
strayed
to her
usual
seat
by the
sea
side
, and indulged in the
pleasurable
sensations
the
surrounding
prospect
inspired
.
Pleasure
had long been a
stranger
to her heart, and
she
welcomed her return,
though in
so
slight
a degree, with an emanation of
gratitude to the benignant Power, who had ordained
that time
should
weaken and meliorate the
severest
affliction.
Entirely occupied by her own reflections,
she
did
not
observe
any
person
near her till a young woman
addressed
her, and inquired the way to the
Castle
. I
want to
see
our
master
,
said
she
, for the young lady
he put to live with mother be very
sick
, and mother
says
she
do think
she
will die.
I am going to the
Castle
,
said
Columbia,
rising
,
and will
shew
you the way.
Where does your mother live? continued
she
;
and how does it happen, that as you call Sir James
Howard your
master
, you do not know the way to his
dwelling?
Why
daisy
me, replied the young woman,
nobody
never lived in that there old place
since
I can
remember, till
master
cum'd here
last
winter; and to
be
sure
, mother
said
,
seeing
as how Sir James was a
single
man, and
wildish
or
so
, it was
best
for brother to
go when the lady wanted to
send
for him; but brother
never went only into the kitching, and
so
never
knowed
whether there was any ladies there; but mayhap
you be cum'd here lately.
How far from the
Castle
do you live, my dear?
said
Columbia, planning in her mind a
visit
to the
sick
lady.
About two miles, replied her companion, down
in a valley near the
sea
; it be but a poor place, full of
rocks, and nobody lives there but
fishermen
. But
father was afear'd to
stay
in town,
cause
as how queen
Mary had ordered all the heretics to be burnt; and
father and mother be both heretics, and
so
we cum'd
and lived here; and we had like to a gotten into
trouble
there. For Sir James be one of Mary's folks; but
that's no matter now,
seeing
that
she
be dead, and I
hope
she
repented of all her cruelty before
she
died.
Before who died?
said
Columbia; who are
you talking about, my good girl?
Why about queen Mary, madam.
Is queen Mary dead?
Laws
daisy
, yes;
she
died
last
November; and
then we
should
have gone home, only father was took
sick
and died, an
so
mother
The girl might have run on for an hour.
Columbia
would not have interrupted her. Mary dead
dead
so
long, and Howard
still
detaining her mother
and
self
in that
solitary
place, gave her an idea that
his
designs
were not laudable or honourable; and then
a ray of hope darted into her mind, that he had
deceived
her in reporting the death of Gorges. She
quickened her
steps
;
she
longed to cheer her mother
with this new-born hope.
Besides
, if Mary was dead,
no doubt her
sister
Elizabeth filled the throne. She
asked
the
question
, and was
answered
in the
affirmative
.
Her heart bounded at the tidings;
she
scarcely
touched the ground,
so
light and
swiftly
did
she
pass
over it. She left her young companion below with
the old
servant
, and flying to her mother, imparted to
her all
she
had heard, all
she
suspected
, and all
she
fondly hoped.
CHAP. XIV.
Change of Scene, Weddings, Burials, and
Christenings
.
Isabelle
joined her daughter in
severely
censuring
the conduct of Howard, by comparing the
time of their departure from
Hamstead
with that of
the late queen's death. They found they were
removed
on the morning following the night
she
died.
We are, I fear, in the power of a villain,
said
Isabelle
, but we
must
exert
ourselves
to
shake
off
this bondage in which he, contrary to the laws of his
country, detains us. I will
seek
the protection of my
sovereign
, nor longer
persuade
my child to give her
L 2
hand
opposed
against
her heart. Howard is
still
absent
,
nor do I think he will return to-night. We will
leave his dreary
prison
, and, conducted by the young
woman you mention,
seek
an
asylum
amongst
the
poor
fishermen
; they may perhaps procure us a
conveyance
to
some
neighbouring town from whence we
may get to London.
Alas! my dear mother,
said
Columbia, you
forget that we have no money.
I have a trifle, my child,
she
replied, and we
must
summon
all our fortitude to brave even
hardship
and danger without
shrinking
. We are women,
it is true, and ought never to forget the delicacy of
our
sex
; but real delicacy
consists
in purity of thought,
and
chastity
of words and actions; not in
shuddering
at an accidental
blast
of wind, or
increasing
the
unaviodable
evils of life by affected
weakness
and
timidity
.
How many of our
sex
are obliged by hard and
daily labour, to procure for
themselves
and children
the bare means of
existence
! How many brave the
severities
of the
most
inclement
seasons
, with hardly
covering
sufficient
to keep them from
perishing
! I
allow that you and I, my beloved child, have been
accustomed
to tenderer
usage
; but we are
particularly
called upon at this time, to exert the
strength
and
faculties of both mind and body, with which nature
has bountifully endowed us.
Oh! my adored mother,
said
Columbia, taught
by your bright precept and example, I feel
myself
equal to
almost
any trial. But ill as you are, to
undertake
so
long,
so
fatiguing a journey, without the
means of procuring either comforts or conveniencies,
if you
should
sink
under it, who then would
advise
,
console
and direct your orphan Columbia?
Courage, my love, replied
Isabelle
; I am not
so
ill as your tender anxiety leads you to think I am.
Believe me, the agitation of the mind weakens and
enervates the whole
system
. The heart,
eased
of
a load of
anguish
, beats lighter, gives a freer play to
the lungs, and a
swifter
circulation to the blood.
What is more conducive to health than change of air
and
exercise
?
Besides
, I have now
some
object in
view, which will give
constant
employment to my
thoughts. Employment naturally begets
cheerfulness
.
Nothing is more pernicious to the health of
mind or body, than indolence and inaction. The
faculties
become torpid; even the chords of
sensibility
lose
their fine tone, and the heart
itself
grows cold and
inanimate as marble. Keep the hands employed, and
the mind occupied in
some
laudable
pursuit
, and a
sweet
serenity
will
diffuse
itself
over the
soul
. The
day
passes
without our noticing the hours, the night
brings peaceful and
refreshing
slumbers
, and by
throwing
the golden chain of
industry
over the wings of
pleasure
, we take the little
sleeting
phantom
prisoner
,
and make it our own forever.
Columbia felt the full force of her mother's
argument
;
for, being
busied
in putting a few
necessaries
together for their journey,
she
was
so
wholly occupied
by the
pleasures
of anticipation, that every
obstacle
seemed
to
vanish
. Heaven in its mercy guard and
support
my dear mother,
said
she
mentally, and
for
myself
I have no fears.
The young woman,
whose
name was Cicely,
undertook
to conduct them to the cottage of her mother.
For the lady
Isabelle
said
, as Sir James was not at
home,
she
would
herself
visit
the
sick
lady, and
administer
such
consolation
as
she
might find needful. The
last
tints of day were fading in the
western
sky
, and
the moon, in full
majestic
splendour
, tipped with her
silver
beams the lofty and antique trees that
surrounded
the
mansion
of Howard, when
these
two
interesting
women, accompanied by Cicely, entered the wood
through which they were obliged to
pass
in their way
to her mother's habitation.
In
silence
they
pursued
their way. Columbia and
her mother could
converse
but on one
subject
, and on
that one, prudence forbade them to
speak
in the
presence
of a third
person
; and Cicely, though
so
communicative
to the daughter, was awed by the
presence
of the
mother.
At length they reached the cottage; it was
small
and meanly
furnished
, but withal
so
clean and neat,
that it
seemed
the habitation of comfort and content.
A middle aged woman, decently clad in home-
spun
stuff
, met them at the door, and looking at the
strangers
with an air of
surprise
, eagerly
asked
for Sir James.
Isabelle
did not give her little guide time to reply,
but
answered
for her, that Sir James being from home,
and
she
being his particular friend and
guest
, had
come to
visit
the
sick
lady, and
see
if any thing could
be done to help her.
Alack a day, my lady,
said
the woman, I
believe
she
be
past
help; I did not think
she
would have
lived till now; but walk into the next room, I believe
she
is quite
sensible
yet, and
seems
to have
something
heavy on her mind. I do think the poor
soul
would
die
easier
, if
she
could tell
somebody
her troubles.
As the loquacious landlady
finished
speaking
,
she
opened the door of the adjoining apartment, and
Columbia
,
with trembling impatience, approached the
bed, and
softly
put back the curtain. The light,
which
stood
on the table by the
beside
,
shed
its rays
full on the face of the invalid, and
discovered
the
features
of Mina. A momentary
slumber
had lulled her
in
forgetfulness
.
Beside
her lay an infant, to all
appearance
but a few hours old.
My heart foreboded this,
said
Isabelle
.
Columbia's
eyes
streamed
as
she
hung over the pale form of
her beloved Mina;
she
sobbed
aloud, but was unable
to
speak
. The dying
sufferer
unclosed
her eyes,
she
saw
, and
instantly
recollected her lady and dear
benefactress
.
Then my prayers are heard,
said
she
, faintly;
I
shall
leave my child, the wretched offspring of
shame
and folly, to the care of an angel.
Oh! my poor Mina, cried Columbia,
sinking
on
her knees by the
bedside
, and endeavouring to
stifle
her grief. Unfortunate creature,
said
the lady
Isabelle
,
taking the cold, damp hand of her
servant
;
severely
hast
thou
suffered
for thy deviation from the
path of rectitude; but do not
despond
, my child.
Your
present
weak
state
, and the
depression
naturally
attendant on your
situation
, makes you think
yourself
near your end; but we will hope
Hope!
said
Mina,
raising
her languid eyes; yes,
I do hope that my
sufferings
are nearly at an end, and
that they have in part made atonement for my errors.
I did not, believe me, I did not leave your protection
voluntarily. I was forced away and brought to this
place; I was taught to believe that you had left
England
.
I have
sometimes
,
since
my
seclusion
here,
seen
the author of my ruin; but could not learn from
him, that he knew aught concerning you. I was
particularly
anxious to
see
him to-night; for
sure
I am,
my dear lady, I
shall
never again view the light of
day. And I
wished
to have with my own hands
committed
his child to his care; but I can with more
confidence
leave it to your protection.
Here a
sudden
fainteness
, made her
pause
. A few
drops
administered
,
some
what revived her, and
she
proceeded:A few
struggles
more, and I
shall
be
at peace. My heart, my heart is broken. Yet
trust
me, it is not my own
sufferings
, the
slights
of the man
for whom I
sacrificed
all, or the
scorn
of a
contemning
world under which I have
sunk
. No! it was the
consciousness
of
lost
innocence; it was the reflection
that my
lapse
from virtue had involved my
kindest
,
best
friends in ruin, which penetrated deep into my
soul
. Sleeping or waking, you were
present
to my
thoughts, and I have died a
thousand
deaths, in daily
anticipating yours.
The lady
Isabelle
endeavoured to
soothe
and
compose
the affectionate, penitent Mina;
assured
her that
what was in her power
she
would cheerfully
promise
to perform; that
she
would look on her child as an
infant given to her protection by the immediate
agency
of Heaven; and though
she
should
think it a duty
to endeavour to awaken in the
breast
of Howard the
feelings of a father towards the
helpless
innocent, yet
it would be her care to
see
that his health and morals
were in no ways neglected.
Yes, my dear Mina,
said
Columbia, he
shall
be
my charge. Come,
compose
yourself
; endeavour to
rest
. When you are better, we will
nurse
the little
rogue together, and I warrant I
shall
prove the better
nurse
.
Blessed
blessed
said
Mina,
grasping
the hand
of Columbia (which from her
first
awaking,
she
had
held in her's). Her eyes were ardently turned
upward
;
they gradually
closed
; her fingers relaxed
their hold, and her head
sunk
upon the pillow.
She is dropped
asleep
,
said
Columbia, I hope
it will
refresh
her. It will, replied her mother,
drawing her from the bed-
side
;
she
will awake relieved
from all her pain.
Do you think
so
indeed! my dear mother.
Yes, my child,
most
assuredly
; for in this world
she
will awake no more.
The feelings of
such
a heart as Columbia's, on
such
an
occasion
, cannot be
described
. The
soul
alive to
sensibility
, can
easily
conceive them; and to the
unfeeling
,
a repetition of her complaints and
sorrows
would be tedious and
uninteresting
. She took the
poor
motherless
infant in her arms, and
sitting
down
in one corner of the room, baptized it with her tears.
The
scene
became too painful for the lady
Isabelle
;
and
whilst
the landlady and her daughter,
assisted
by
a
servant
, prepared the body of the departed Mina for
her
last
resting
place,
she
walked in a little garden
before
the door,
seeking
, from the cool evening air, a relief
from that
oppression
on the heart, which the recent
scene
had
occasioned
.
The air in a
slight
degree had the
desired
effect.
She returned to the
house
, and approached the door
that led to the apartment of death. The
lifeless
body
was now
stretched
upon the bed, on the
side
of which
sat
Columbia
still
weeping, and
clasping
the infant to
her
besom
. Her
sorrow
was too
sacred
, the
lesson
was too important, for her mother to interrupt her.
The
sound
of
footsteps
called the attention of
Isabelle
from her daughter. She turned to
see
from whence
the
sound
proceeded, and beheld
just
entering the
house
, Howard.
The lady
Isabelle
,
said
he, with a look of
astonishment
,
by what miracle do I
see
you here? and
where is my charming Columbia?
She is here
also
, replied
Isabelle
, with a
solemn
voice. Follow me; I will lead you to her.
They entered the apartment together. Columbia
raised
not her eyes. The heart of Howard beat quick,
as, leading him toward the bed,
Isabelle
drew the
covering
from the death-
stamped
face of Mina, and
pointing
to her,
said
emphatically, Behold the works of
thy hands, Howard! Here contemplate the fruits of
seduction
!
At the name of Howard, Columbia
started
;
she
read the emotions of his
soul
in his
expressive
countenance
.
Rising
from her
seat
,
she
presented
the infant
to him, and laying her right hand on his arm, called
his attention from the pale
corse
of her lamented
servant
.
Gaze not there, Howard,
said
she
; the
injuries of the mother are
past
redress
; but behold
your child, make reparation here!
Howard, the gay, the
thoughtless
,
dissipated
Howard
was
struck
to the heart. He
saw
the once lovely,
blooming, cheerful Mina, an inanimate
mass
.
Those
sparkling
eyes, that
first
awakened the licentious
passion
,
were
closed
in death; that heart, that had but
too much
sensibility
, too much
sincerity
for its own
peace, was cold and
still
. His
seductive
powers had
hurried an amiable creature out of the world, and
introduced
into it a
helpless
being, who,
should
he live,
through life would
blush
for the frailty of his mother,
and execrate the
licentiousness
of his father. He took
the infant from the arms of Columbia,
pressed
the
hand which
she
had laid on his arm, attempted to
speak
, but his voice died away in inarticulate
sounds
.
The bitter tears of
self
-
accusation
rushed
down his
cheeks; he returned the child to her; and throwing
himself
beside
the
lifeless
Mina, gave a
loose
to the
anguish
of his heart.
Isabelle
led her daughter from the room; but
during
the whole night Howard never left it for a
moment
,
and
small
was the protion of
repose
which any
of the inhabitants of the cottage
tasted
.
By the dawn of day,
Isabelle
wished
to begin her
journey towards London. She
sent
in a
request
to
Howard, that he would grant her a few moments
audience
.
He complied. When he entered the
apartment
,
she
thus
addressed
him. I
sent
for you not,
Sir James, to irritate your
sensibility
by
unseasonable
reproaches, nor to inquire what injury I had ever done
you, that you have thus wantonly heaped
misery
on
me and mine. I
wish
but to tell you, that I am fully
sensible
how
unjustly
and on what
false
pretences
you have detained me here; and that, knowing
myself
perfectly free, and
safe
in the protection of my
queen, and the laws of my country, I may travel
without
molestation
whithersoever
I
please
. I
shall
immediately proceed towards London. I
also
wish
to inform you, that the poor departed victim, in her
dying moments, recommended her infant to my care,
and died in the full confidence of my protection and
tenderness
being extended towards it during its years
of
helpless
infancy. I am
sensible
of your prior right;
the right of nature is incontrovertible; and I have
still
so
good an opinion of your heart (when left to
the dictates of
reason
and religion) as to think you
will
discharge
the duty of a parent with
conscientious
strictness
. But I have to
request
, you will
suffer
me
to be informed where the child may be placed, that in
case
of
indisposition
, I may have it in my power to
visit
and
see
that he is properly
nursed
and attended.
Howard was for a moment
silent
. His proud
spirit
was humbled to the
dust
. But Howard, when
convinced
of an error, knew how to make atonement
without
descending
from the dignity of man.
Noble lady,
said
he, I have been highly
culpable
.
My heart tells me at this moment, I have
forfeited
all right to the protecting power of an
Omnipotent
,
by
abusing
his good gifts, and
debasing
the
noblest
work of his hands. But I am not
so
far
lost
to
virtue, as to
persist
in error
against
the conviction of
reason
. I have injured you, lady Arundel, I have
wounded the heart of your lovely daughter, by a
false
tale of the death of her lover; but, thank Heaven,
reparation
here is not beyond my power. My
servants
shall
attend you; my
horses
are at your command;
depart when you
please
. You
shall
have
safe
conduct
to the court of the royal Elizabeth, where you will
meet Sir Egbert Gorges, rich in every virtue as well
as in the favour of his
sovereign
. Your
request
in
regard
to the
hapless
offspring of
indiscretion
,
shall
gladly
be complied with; his infant wants I will take care
shall
be amply
supplied
; I will endeavour, by
tenderness
toward him, to atone for the injuries I have done
his mother. But your
friendship
and attention, in
directing
my cares to a proper channel, will be a
valuable
acquisition
to him, and an act of
condescension
toward
me. I will
see
the
lost
Mina
repose
on her
last
bed, and then conduct my child and his
nurse
to
London
,
where, making ample
provision
for his
support
through life, I will leave him to your protection, and
seek
, in the
clash
of arms and the
pursuit
of glory, to
lose
the remembrance of
circumstances
which tend at
once to my
dishonour
and
disquiet
.
Early in the day,
Isabelle
and her daughter
commenced
their journey toward the metropolis. Though
the
spirits
of Columbia had received a
severe
shock
from the death of her favourite Mina, yet the bright
prospects
that opened to her, in her recovered liberty
and the certainty of Sir Egbert's life and
safety
,
contributed
in a great degree to
dissipate
her melancholy; and
as they drew near the
conclusion
of their journey, her
heart vibrated with the
most
pleasurable
sensations
.
A
sudden
thunder
shower
, which obliged them to
stop
when within a few hours ride of London,
impeded
their journey, and they were
necessitated
unwillingly
to
sleep
another night on the road. After an early
repast
, they retired to their apartment, when
just
as
Columbia was going into bed,
she
missed
her ring from
off her finger. Oh! madam,
said
she
, I have
lost
my ring; and yet I am
sure
I
saw
it on my
finger
M
just
before we went to
supper
. Every part of
the bed-chamber was now
searched
, every article of
her attire carefully
shaken
, her pockets turned
inside
out, but all in vain.
Perhaps,
said
Isabelle
, you may have dropped
it in the room below. The
hostess
was
summoned
,
and
requested
to look for it,
whilst
Columbia, too
anxious to think of
resting
, had (
almost
unknown to
herself
) again put on her clothes. The
hostess
returned
.
I have been very fortunate,
said
she
; a
gentleman
who has been
seeking
game in the
neighbouring
forest
, being overtaken by night
sooner
than he
expected, entered the
house
just
as you came up
stairs
,
and being
shewn
into the apartment you had left, has
found the ring, and here it is.
Columbia eagerly extended her hand to receive it;
but overcome with joy and
astonishment
,
she
gave a
sudden
exclamation of
pleasure
, and
springing
toward
the door, was
instantly
folded in the arms of Sir
Egbert
Gorges.
It was he, who with Rawlins had been in
pursuit
of
game in the adjacent woods. Entering the
apartment
Columbia had
just
left, he
saw
something
glitter
on the floor, and
stooping
, picked up the identical
ring which he had placed on her finger at parting.
His
surprise
was
excessive
; he had heard that the lady
Isabelle
and her daughter had been in the power of
Mary, and it was
universally
believed they had,
through Howard's means,
escaped
; that they were
at that moment under the
same
roof with him, he had
not the
most
distant
idea; but the
person
who dropped
the ring might probably give him
some
information
concerning her. He was gazing at it,
lost
in
conjecture
,
his
bosom
throbbing with anxiety to learn her
fate, when the
hostess
entered the room.
I beg pardon,
said
she
, but I come to look for
a ring which a lady thinks
she
has dropped here; I
hope if you have
seen
it, gentlemen, you will
restore
it; for indeed the poor young lady
seems
in a
sad
taking
about it.
A young lady?
said
Sir Egbert.
Aye, a young lady, replied our loquacious
hostess
;
and as
sweet
a young lady as eye ever looked
on. I warrant it is
some
love token. Oh! if you
had but
seen
her
earnestness
, when
she
entreated me
to come and look for it.
I have found the ring,
said
Sir Egbert, his heart
throbbing
so
violently as to render
respiration
difficult
;
here, take it to the young lady, and as you
give it her,
suffer
me to
see
her; leave the door partly
open as you go in. A golden argument, with which
Sir Egbert enforced his
request
, prevented objections,
and taking the plain gold ring from his own finger,
he
sent
it to Columbia.
It may
easily
be
supposed
, that
so
happy,
so
unexpected
a meeting,
banished
sleep
effectually from the
eyes of all.
Isabelle
and her daughter returned to the
parlour, where inquiry, recital, and
unreserved
confidence
on both
sides
, occupied the remainder of the
night. They learnt that young Dudley was
safe
in
the protection of Elizabeth, who had
restored
to him
the title and
estates
of his father, and
promised
to be
his friend and
patroness
.
Nor was Mina forgot; Rawlins
seized
the
first
pause
in their
interesting
conversation
to inquire after the
object
of his
sincere
affection.
Isabelle
hesitated
;
she
read his
tenderness
in the
emotions of his countenance. At length the fatal
truth was
disclosed
, and the piece of
silver
which
Columbia
had taken from around her neck after her
decease
,
was
restored
to him.
He took it; he gazed on it in
silence
. His manly
features were tinged with the pale hue of death. He
raised
his eyes to the face of Columbia. The look
was
expressive
; it
seemed
to
say
, You loved her
lady
;
do you not lament her? Columbia breathed
a
sigh
of
commiseration
. His
heartstrings
, which
were drawn
almost
to breaking, were
softened
by its
balmy influence. He
passed
his hand
across
his eyes
to
dissipate
the tear, the mournful
catastrophe
of his
beloved Mina had extorted, and putting the piece of
silver
into his
bosom
,
hastily
left the apartment.
The ruddy morn peeped through the
eastern
gates,
before this happy trio thought of
separating
.
Isabelle
and Columbia at length retired to their chamber; but
Morpheus was flown beyond recall. Unfeeling deity!
he makes his
longest
visits
to the ignorant and
insensible
.
The
peasant
,
whilst
he labours
amongst
the corn
he
sows
,
strews
the
somnific
poppy; and in return, the
leaden-winged power collects its
sweets
, and
sheds
them
on his pillow. From the couch bedewed with tears
he takes his flight, and when
ecstatic
joy has
strung
each nerve, and the exhilarated
spirits
mount toward
heaven, he
stands
aloof and
shakes
his heavy wings,
nor for one moment will impede the tide of
bliss
,
though courted
earnestly
by weary nature, who
languishes
for
rest
from each extreme, whether of grief or
pleasure
.
Presented
at the court of Elizabeth, Columbia
shone
conspicuous
. Her beauty
struck
the admiring
eye; her affability, good
sense
and virtue captivated
the heart. Her delighted, happy mother
bestowed
her hand on Sir Egbert Gorges with unfeigned
satisfaction
;
and remaining in the capital till Columbia
was mother to a
son
christened
Ferdinando, and a
daughter named Elizabeth,
she
retired to
Austenbury
Castle
.
Her old
servant
Cora was no more. Matthias was
in his
second
childhood; but he experienced all the
pleasure
of which human nature in its
last
stage
is
capable
,
in the return of his revered lady. The autumn
following, he
slept
in peace; and before the
ensuing
spring
had called forth the
primrose
, or decked the
almond tree in
blushing
sweets
, the lady
Isabelle
, the
descendant
of the great Columbus, the daughter of the
Peruvian
princess
Orrabella
, gently declined into the
vale of years, and
rested
in the
house
appointed for
all living.
Columbia on this
occasion
visited
the
scene
of her
juvenile
pleasures
. Her feelings on the departure of
her mother were
indescribable
. Her tears again
consecrated
the memory of the unfortunate Mina; and
having given orders that the court yard, the filbert
walk, the tower and
eastern
wing of the
Castle
should
be kept in
constant
repair,
she
returned to London,
where
she
continued for many years to
shine
eminently
in the characters of wife, mother, and
mistress
of a
family.
She died in the fiftieth year of her age, after
having
given birth to five children; Ferdinando, heir to
his father's title and
estate
; Elizabeth, who was
married
to lord Henry Dudley; Jane, who died in her
infancy; Edward, who, embracing the
service
of his
country in a nautical
profession
, and in the year 1585
embarking with the brave and enterprizing Sir
Francis
Drake,
perished
in the attack
against
St. Domingo;
and Beatina, who married into the ancient and
respectable
family of the Penns.
Sir Egbert Gorges
himself
lived to a good old age;
and dying, bequeathed his title and
estates
to a
son
,
who thought hereditary honour of little value to the
possessor
unless
supported
by humanity,
justice
and
mercy.
Sir Ferdinando Gorges regarded the honour of
ancestry
in no other light than as a
stimulus
to
praiseworthy
actions. My father,
said
he, was
beloved
and
esteemed
for his virtue, honour and integrity;
I will not fully the name I bear, by any action
derogatory
to the character of a MAN and a
CHRISTIAN
.
Sir Ferdinando Gorges was a gentleman of the old
world;
should
the character appear unnatural to any
of the
present
time, let them remember that they are
reading a tale of old times, and exculpate the
author
from the charge of romance and improbability.
A certain modern author, a noble author too, (if
inheriting a title
constitutes
nobility) has been at
infinite
trouble to explain the
requisites
necessary
to form
the character of a fine gentleman; unfortunately, he
forgot humanity, truth and religion. Sir Ferdinando
Gorges imagined, that to love and
worship
his
Creator
,
to
scorn
to
assert
a
falsehood
, and to do as he
would be done by in the
most
minute particular, was
to
deserve
the
distinguished
rank he inherited from
M 2
his
ancestors
; and it is a moral certainty, that Sir
Ferdinando was perfectly right in his ideas of the
character
of a real gentleman.
CHAP. XV.
A Century when
past
is but as a Moment.
Sir
Ferdinando Gorges took but a
small
share
in
the active
scenes
of life, till the unfortunate Earl
of
Essex
, favourite to Elizabeth, incurred the
censure
of his
sovereign
by neglecting her commands, and
hurried
by the
impetuosity
of his
passion
,
instigated
the
populace (ever eager for novelty) to arm in his
support
and defence, which called forth the aid of the loyal
subject
in behalf of the queen's
disputed
power. It was
then Sir Ferdinando
started
into notice; he
asserted
the prerogative of royalty, and enforced the
commands
of his
sovereign
, not as the will of a
despotic
tyrant, but as the laws of a well-regulated
government
,
necessary
to be
supported
, for the peace,
interest
and
security
of millions who lived under their
protection
.
He was a man remarkable for public
spirit
; it was
the main
spring
that actuated all his
pursuits
. Every
wish
of his heart, every undertaking in which he
engaged
,
was
designed
to promote the general welfare.
About the year 1624, a number of
persons
having
formed
themselves
into a company for planting and
settling
a colony in New England, North-America,
Sir Ferdinando was appointed by royal authority one
of the directors, and expended great part of his
paternal
inheritance in promoting the
design
. The
spirit
of his great and
enterprising
ancestor
seemed
to revive
in him, and nothing but his advanced age prevented
him from
crossing
the Atlantic
himself
, in
search
of
discoveries
that might enrich or enlighten the
rising
generation.
Sir Ferdinando had married, at an early age, a
lady of family and fortune; but
she
lived only to give
birth to a daughter; and Sir Ferdinando was
so
firmly
attached to her
whilst
living, and
so
sincerely
regretted
her untimely departure, that he thought no other
woman could
supply
her place. His
sister
Elizabeth
was nearly at the
same
period left a widow, with only
one child, a boy about five years old. To whom
could Sir Ferdinando apply to take the charge of his
infant daughter,
so
well as to lady Dudley? And where
could the young, the lovely widow find
herself
so
safe
,
so
secure
from reproach, as in the family and under
the protection of her brother?
As the children grew up, Henry regarded his little
cousin
Isabelle
with more than fraternal affection; but
the tenets of the reformed religion forbidding a union
between two
persons
so
nearly related by the ties of
blood, neither Sir Ferdinando nor lady Dudley
encouraged
an affection, which in their ideas was a crime;
and with a
design
to prevent its
progress
, at the age
of nineteen, Henry was
sent
to travel, and
finish
his
education by gaining a competent knowledge of
foreign
courts and manners.
Though
Isabelle
Gorges, at the departure of her
cousin
for the continent, was
scarcely
fourteen years
old, yet Henry was fully
sensible
of the nature of the
emotions he felt in her favour;
whilst
she
, the pure
child of
simplicity
, had no idea but that
she
might
love him beyond all other
terrestrial
beings, and
confess
it with impunity. She hung upon his neck at
taking leave,
besought
him not to forget her, and
spent
the whole day in tears. Every
ensuing
day
seemed
still
to make his
absence
more intolerable.
She thought of him
incessantly
,
spoke
of him often,
and when a letter arrived, would hang over her
father's
shoulder
with delighted attention
whilst
he read
the contents.
Henry Dudley was a man exactly calculated to do
honour to the noble race from whence he
sprang
; the
letters of his governor to his mother were filled with
his
praises
. To a brave, undaunted
spirit
he united a
soul
alive to all the finer feelings of humanity. With
an ardent
thirst
for knowledge, he
possessed
an
understanding
that directed his
studies
and
researches
to the
most
useful
, laudable objects; from the
gentleness
of
his nature liable to error, but open to conviction, and
ever ready to make atonement.
He has but one fault,
said
his governor in one of
his letters, and that is an
impetuosity
of
disposition
when in
pursuit
of any favourite object; his affections
are ardent in the extreme, and his
passions
, or rather
his
excessive
sensibility
, hurry him often beyond the
bounds of
reason
and
discretion
. But this error is like
a
spot
on the
sun
, which may be
discernible
whilst
his beams are weakened by the
mists
of the morning,
but when he
shines
in full meridian
splendour
will
become imperceptible.
Dear, beloved Henry! exclaimed
Isabelle
, as
she
listened
to her aunt
whilst
she
read the
passage
. Oh!
why is he not my brother? I am
sure
though, if he
were my brother, I could not love him better than I
do now; and you, my charming aunt,
she
continued,
throwing her arms round the neck of lady Dudley,
I think I could not love you more than I do now,
but yet I
should
like to call you mother. I never
knew my own mother; you have amply
supplied
her
place. Let me call you mother, dear! dear! mother.
Oh! there is
something
so
delightful in the word,
that my heart overflows with tender
transports
as I
utter it. What a happy girl I
should
be if I could
say
, My father, my mother, and my brother Henry.
The lady Dudley perceived that the innocence of
Isabelle
was equal to her
tenderness
, and that in
wishing
to call her mother,
she
meant no more, than that
by her being
so
, Henry would become her brother.
Henry continued his travels till he had reached his
twenty-third year; it was then thought
necessary
to
call him home; and as in his letters he had never
mentioned
Isabelle
only as a relation, Sir Ferdinando
hoped
absence
, and a variety of
scenes
, had totally
eradicated the youthful predilection he had conceived
in her favour. But in this he was
mistaken
; the
passion
which began in childhood had
increased
with his
years; and though during his travels various other
pursuits
had contributed to keep it dormant, it
still
remained
in his heart, and waited only for a re-union
with
Isabelle
, to blaze anew with more than its former
ardency.
During his
residence
at the court of France, Henry
Dudley formed an acquaintance with Howard
Fitz-Howard
,
grandson
to the unfortunate Mina.
Sir James Howard had
conscientiously
performed
his
promise
, in providing
splendidly
for the education
of his
son
, whom he had
christened
James
Fitz-Howard
;
but as he left him in charge with an
ecclesiastic
of the
Romish
religion, in order to his being brought
up in that faith, the lady Arundel could do no more
than
sometimes
visit
him during his infancy. His
father died abroad before he was fifteen. Leaving
him a very large
share
of his
estates
,
soon
after this
event his governor removed him to Paris; and from
that period, the family of Sir Egbert Gorges were
totally
unacquainted with his welfare or
pursuits
.
The
priest
to
whose
care he had been
entrusted
,
was a man of
strict
probity; he paid the
utmost
attention
to his education, and, uniting the friend and
companion
with the
instructor
, made him love virtue for its
own
sake
; for, beholding its effects in the
conversation
and manners of his
respected
tutor, he grew
emulous
to copy what appeared
so
amiable. His father
had been well-known to
some
of the
most
noble
families
in France, and Fitz-Howard, at an early age,
found
himself
in a very elevated circle,
caressed
and
esteemed
by all. He married the daughter of a rich
farmer-general, and Howard Fitz-Howard was the
only
surviving
fruit of the union.
This young man was a character
composed
of
contrarieties
,
at once
versatile
as the wind, and
boisterous
as the waves. With
scarcely
a trait of his father's
virtues, he inherited the vices of his grandfather, with
all that imbecility of mind, that
heedless
credulity,
which had been the
cause
of the ruin of his
grandmother
.
Eager in the
pursuit
of
pleasure
, a
passiomate
admirer of female beauty, and
master
of an
affluent
fortune, uncontrolled by any, he
lavished
it with a
prosuse
hand on
those
who flattered his follies,
careless
whether they were
deserving
favour or contempt.
It may be thought
strange
, that a young man like
Henry Dudley could form an intimacy with
such
a
character. But youth is ever
unsuspecting
, and the
generous nature of Dudley could not imagine the
gaiety and vivacity of Fitz-Howard was
almost
the
only recommendation he
possessed
.
At the time Henry was recalled home,
Fitz-Howard
expressed
a
wish
to accompany him to England.
Madame Fitz-Howard had never, from his infancy,
ventured to contradict any
wish
of her darling; and,
unwilling as
she
was to part with him,
she
at length
consented
to his going, on condition that the
visit
was
limited to
six
months. Accordingly the two friends,
attended by their
respective
governors, arrived in
England
about the middle of November, and with all
the
speed
the mode of travelling then in
use
would
allow, proceeded immediately to London. The
last
rays of daylight glimmered in the
west
as they
crossed
the Thames, and before they reached the
mansion
of
Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the family were quietly
settled
to the employments of the evening.
Sir Ferdinando was reading to his wife and
daughter
,
who were employed in embroidering a
dress
, in
which
Isabelle
was to be
presented
at the court of
James the
First
, who now filled the throne of the
deceased
Elizabeth; uniting, by his
accession
to the
British
crown, the two kingdoms of England and
Scotland
in one. (This monarch was
son
to the
unfortunate
Mary, queen of Scots, who was beheaded at
Fotheringay
Castle
during the reign of Elizabeth,
after having been detained a
prisoner
there upwards of
fifteen years.)
Isabelle
Gorges was now eighteen. Her features
were regular, but not at
first
view
strikingly
handsome
.
The radiance of her mild blue eyes did not dart at
once upon the heart, taking the
astonished
senses
captive
;
but through the
softening
shade
of long, dark,
silken
lashes
,
stole
imperceptibly on the
soul
, and made
it all her own. Her
stature
was above the middle
size
, yet not
so
tall as to render her
person
masculine
.
Her limbs were round, and
sinely
proportioned. A
chaste
dignity, tempered by the
most
winning
softness
,
informed her manners, and rendered her
irresistibly
charming.
It
must
be remembered, that Dudley had not
seen
her for above four years. Imagine, then, what
must
be his feelings, when he
saw
the lively, affectionate
girl, transformed into the elegant, dignified woman!
Isabelle
had been hourly expecting her
cousin
, and
was too much occupied in anticipating the
pleasures
of their meeting, to be very attentive to her father's
reading; nay, even the work in which
she
was
engaged
,
though it continued to employ her fingers, did
not for a moment occupy her thoughts. Every
noise
in the court yard, every quick
step
ascending
the
stairs
,
made her heart beat quick, and her eyes would glance
eagerly toward the door.
A
confused
murmur in the great hall had made Sir
Ferdinando
pause
. He is come,
said
Isabelle
,
dropping
her work and
starting
from her feat. The door
opened, and Dudley was in a moment at the feet of
his mother.
Released
from the maternal embrace,
he turned toward his lovely
cousin
, and received a
welcome, which filled the
breast
of Fitz-Howard with
envy. Recovered from the momentary delirium that
ever pervades the too
sensible
system
upon a re-union
with beloved friends, Dudley
presented
his new friend,
who was received with cordiality, and immediately
invited to take an apartment in the
house
of Sir
Ferdinando
,
during his
residence
in London.
A very few days
served
to convince the father of
Isabelle
, that the
absence
Henry had been obliged to
submit
to, from his
cousin
, had acted in the
same
manner
as a
small
quantity of water does when thrown
on a fierce fire, gave a momentary damp to its
progress
,
only that it might
burst
forth with double
violence
,
destroying
every object that attempted to
oppose
its fury.
Isabelle
,
modest
, timid, and tremblingly alive to
feel the
smallest
infringement on the delicacy of her
fex, was yet
susceptible
of a pure, ardent
passion
for
her
cousin
. Fitz-Howard, an immate in their family,
read the workings in the minds of all; for each
strove
to hide from the other their real
sentiments
. The lady
Dudley, and her brother Sir Ferdinando,
saw
with
concern the
passion
which
consumed
their children;
but they endeavoured to conceal that knowledge even
from each other,
still
labouring, by various
schemes
,
to divert the attention of
Isabelle
and Henry different
ways.
Henry, when
conversing
with Fitz-Howard, would
speak
with rapturous eloquence in
praise
of his
cousin
;
but if his friend at any time
accused
him of being too
partial, he would
say
, Is it not natural for brothers
to be partial to their
sisters
? Surely, replied
Fitz Howard, but do you love
Isabelle
Gorges no
more than you would love a
sister
? No more, on
my honour, Dudley would reply, and immediately
change the
conversation
.
Lady Dudley, thinking to
sathom
the
sentiments
of
Isabelle
in regard to her
son
, would
speak
of him in
her
presence
. At the
smallest
encomium
bestowed
on
Henry by his mother, the eyes of
Isabelle
would beam
with
pleasure
; a brighter glow would ornament her
cheeks; and her coral lips, half
unclosed
by the
smile
of innate
satisfaction
,
displaying
her pearly teeth,
would give that
chaste
animation to her whole
countenance
,
as rendered it
scarcely
a degree below angelic.
When on the contrary,
should
she
hear a
syllable
of
disapprobation
escape
her aunt, her lips would
tremble
,
her cheek
lose
its carnation hue; and her eyes
half filled with tears, her brow contracted by the
oppression
of her heart, would
seem
to
say
, Do not
speak
harshly
of him, I am certain he does not
deserve
it. And when lady Dudley has remarked that
Henry
was an uncommon favourite,
she
would reply,
Certainly
he is, and can you blame me? Is he not your
son
? Surely I may love him for your
sake
, and you
will not contemn me.
Thus every
person
that
composed
the family of Sir
Ferdinando, endeavoured to conceal their real feelings;
but Fitz-Howard read them all. From his
first
introduction
,
he had felt his heart
strongly
drawn
toward
Isabelle
. At
first
, he imagined an
insuperable
objection would
arise
from the
passion
of Dudley; but
when from various
circumstances
he learnt that the
parents of neither party approved that
passion
, he
conceived
the idea of ingratiating
himself
with lady
Dudley
,
and leading her, by imperceptible degrees, to
approve
his own
pretensions
. He
foresaw
that the
difference
of religion would prove an
almost
insurmountable
obstacle
; but Fitz-Howard had not been
educated
in a manner, that would lead him to think either
religion or morality was of any very great
consequence
,
when
opposed
against
his own inclinations.
In order to
accomplish
this
desired
end, he in turn
made
himself
the friend and confidant of all. He
listened
attentively to Sir Ferdinando's account of new
discoveries
, and approved all the plans he had
formed
for the extending of the
blessings
of navigation and
commerce over the whole habitable globe. With
Dudley, he joined in extolling the beauty, virtue and
accomplishments
of
Isabelle
, and without pretending
to perceive the extent of his attachment, encouraged
the affection he
seemed
to
disapprove
.
To the lady
Isabelle
he was another character;
talked of the different opinions that were adopted by
the people of England in regard to religious matters;
mentioned his own faith, not as
opposing
it to the
faith of the pious,
enthusiastic
lady Elizabeth; but
appearing
to
wish
instruction
in the right way, as
desiring
to have his own errors corrected. Nor was this
conduct entirely the
result
of art; it was chiefly the
effect of nature. For Fitz-Howard could never
maintain
his own opinion
against
strong
argument.
Indeed
,
he could hardly be
said
to have an opinion of
his own; and had he
conversed
four
successive
days
with
persons
of four different religions, he would, at
N
the end of that period, have been
persuaded
that he
with whom he
conversed
last
, was certainly
most
right.
Thus
versatile
by nature, it cannot be wondered at,
that, finding this
versatility
likely to forward his
most
favourite views, he took no pains to correct it, but
gave free indulgence to a
disposition
, which,
whilst
it
rendered him agreeable to every
separate
branch of
the family,
promised
him ample gratification in the
favour of the aunt of
Isabelle
.
To
Isabelle
herself
he was tender,
assiduous
; in
short
, all that love could
inspire
, or
friendship
wish
.
She rode,
she
walked,
she
danced and chatted with
Fitz-Howard without
restraint
; though at the
same
time
she
would have preferred the company of
Dudley. But if his company gave her
most
pleasure
,
it was a
pleasure
so
mixed with anxiety,
such
fear of
offending,
such
trembling
apprehension
and
embarrassment
,
that it became no longer
desirable
, and
she
evidently avoided giving him any opportunities of
entertaining her, except in the
presence
of her father
and lady Dudley.
Fitz-Howard
possessed
but little penetration, but a
very competent
share
of vanity
supplied
its place. He
imagined that the apparent preference
Isabelle
shewed
him, was the effect of real liking, and that
she
was
captivated by his
person
, manners and fortune.
Buoyed
up by
these
ideas, he made
proposals
to her father,
offered to become a
proselyte
to the reformed religion,
and in every other
respect
his alliance was
unexceptionable
.
Sir Ferdinando, flattering
himself
that
Isabelle
was
not altogether
averse
to the union, referred
Fitz-Howard
to his
sister
for a final
answer
; and lady Dudley,
prepossessed
in his favour by his
specious
manners,
eager
to confirm him a convert to the
Protestant
cause
,
and
wishing
to put an end at once to the hopes of her
son
, approved his
suit
; and that very evening, as they
were
sitting
conversing
together in an
unconstrained
,
confidential manner, declared to her niece the
approbation
she
had given to the
proposals
of Fitz-Howard,
and
advised
her
seriously
to think of him as the man
destined
to become her
husband
.
Astonishment
for
some
moments kept her
silent
; at
length
she
told her aunt, that
she
was by no means
partial to the man
she
so
warmly recommended, nor
did
she
wish
to alter her
state
;
she
was perfectly
contented
with her
present
condition. Happy in the
affection
of her father and lady Dudley,
she
wished
not
to quit their protection for that of a
stranger
, and
begged leave to decline the
proposed
union.
I am much afraid,
Isabelle
,
said
that lady, that
you
nourish
improper, nay, criminal
wishes
. I fear
you indulge chimerical hopes of a future union with
Henry Dudley. But do not deceive
yourself
, my
child;
whilst
I live,
those
hopes can never be realized,
without incurring the
severest
malediction of an
offended
parent.
If I know my own heart, madam,
said
Isabelle
,
somewhat
piqued by her aunt's peremptory
prohibition
,
it never yet has indulged improper hopes or
criminal
wishes
. Its every emotion has been
regulated
by your precepts, and I
trust
it will never
dishonour
its noble
instructress
. But if to love and
prefer
your
son
above all other human beings
constitutes
guilt, I am in
some
measure
guilty. I am
sensible
of
the barrier
custom
, and perhaps you will
say
, religion, has
placed between us; I have no
wish
to break through
that barrier; but
whilst
I am
satisfied
with loving
him only as a brother, I
see
no
reason
why I
should
be compelled to become the wife of another.
Nor
shall
you be compelled, my
dearest
cousin
,
said
Dudley, who being in the adjoining apartment
(the door of which had been accidentally left ajar)
had overheard the whole
conversation
; no divine
ordinance forbids our union; then why
should
superstition
impose
such
shackles
on us? Have we not
reason
to direct us? Why then
should
we
submit
blindly
and implicitly to the opinions of others? Madam,
look not thus angry on me, continued he, turning
toward his mother. You have heard from her own
lips the preference with which my charming
cousin
honours me; then give her to me freely, and with
her
bestow
your maternal benediction. For here, in
the
sight
of Heaven, I vow
solemnly
to have no wife
but her, to live but for her
sake
, and may that
moment
put a period to my
existence
, in which
she
is
separated
from me.
It was in vain lady Dudley attempted to interrupt
him before the
solemn
vow had
passed
his lips; in vain
she
entreated him to recal it. He repeated it with a
vehemence
that made her tremble; and turning from
him in
displeasure
,
she
took the hand of the affrighted
Isabelle
, and led her from the apartment.
Disguise
had now become
useless
to all parties.
Isabelle
, daily
tormented by the
assiduities
of Fitz-Howard,
admonished
by her aunt and threatened by her father, felt
existence
a burthen. The time
she
was obliged to
pass
in company
she
laboured under the
most
cruel
constraint
, and her hours of retirement were
spent
in
sighs
, tears, and unavailing complaints.
Dudley no longer made one of the family. He had
removed to a
house
of his own, where he had
solicited
his mother to
preside
; but her affection for her brother
had prompted her at
first
to decline the
proposal
, and
the
reason
may
easily
be conceived, why Henry now
ceased
to urge his
request
. Fitz-Howard too had
quitted the
house
of Sir Ferdinando, for apartments
where, being
himself
master
, his actions were not
so
strictly
scrutinized
as they were liable to be in the
family of a man virtuous from principle, and
sincerely
pious, without being either a bigot or an
enthusiast
.
Though Dudley was no longer an inmate in the
family, he was a daily
visitant
at the
house
of his
uncle
,
and found
sufficient
opportunities to forward his
suit
with
Isabelle
;
persecuted
on one
side
, and
earnestly
solicited
on the other, where is the wonder that
she
should
listen
to the
syren
voice of honourable love,
and,
bestowing
her hand on him who had long
possessed
her heart, become the wife of Dudley? Secretly,
and by his own chaplain, was the ceremony
performed
.
They waited a favourable moment to
supplicate
a paternal
blessing
, and, fearful of a premature
discovery
,
became more
circumspect
in their behaviour
towards
each other; their interviews were conducted
with the
utmost
caution, and
suspicion
was again
lulled
asleep
. But Fitz-Howard
still
persisted
in his
addresses
, though treated with the
most
contemptuous
coldness
by the object of his adoration.
The
spring
was now rapidly advancing, and the
lady
Dudley removed with her niece to an elegant seat
she
possessed
near
Windsor
. Sir Ferdimando, fully
occupied
in the laudable
design
of extending the
blessings
himself
enjoyed, to
distant
, unenlightened nations,
seldom
quitted the capital, except for an hour or two,
to breathe the
fresh
air, and enjoy the
pleasure
of
beholding
his beloved child.
In this retirement, Dudley often
visited
his wife;
and unfortunately, Fitz-Howard, who had taken up
his
summer
residence
at
Windsor
,
saw
him come from
the garden of lady Dudley one morning at four o'clock.
That a
son
should
be
seen
coming from the dwelling
of his mother, was in
itself
nothing
surprising
; but
Fitz-Howard know there was a
coolness
between
them, and
shrewdly
suspected
to whom
these
early
visits
were paid. His chief knowledge of the
sex
being
formed from his acquaintance among the
most
unworthy
part, he had always affirmed that every
woman
may be won, however
seemingly
virtuous.
Impressed
with this idea, he imagined
Isabelle
had forgot
the
respect
due to
herself
, and,
whilst
his
breast
swelled
with envy at the
supposed
good fortune of Dudley, he
resolved
to
share
her favours with him.
To this end he became more
assiduous
in his
visits
;
and one evening having followed her into the garden,
informing her
first
with his knowledge of Henry's
visits
,
he
addressed
her in terms that made the
chaste
soul
of
Isabelle
congeal to an icicle. Swelling
resentment
for a moment kept her
silent
, and when her words
found vent, that laudable
resentment
added
keenness
to her reproof. Her pointed rebukes, which
should
have effectually
repulsed
his
passion
,
served
but to
inflame
it; he caught her in his arms;
she
shrieked
;
her voice caught the ear of her
husband
, who had
just
entered the garden by a private door, to keep an
appointment
he had made with her the preceding day. Again
N 2
she
shrieked
; he redoubled his
speed
, and entering the
arbour,
struck
the
assailer
of his honour to the earth,
before his
step
had been heard approaching.
Isabelle
was a woman
possessed
of
strong
fortitude;
but terror, joy,
apprehension
at once
assailed
her, and
she
sunk
fainting upon the earth. Her
husband
stooped
to
raise
her, and the cowardly Fitz-Howard,
meditating
only revenge, recovered from the blow which
had for a moment
stunned
his faculties,
snatched
a
stiletto
from his
side
, where he
constantly
wore it, and
plunged it into the
bosom
of Dudley.
The cries of
Isabelle
had reached the ear of her
aunt, and
she
had
sent
out
servants
in
quest
of her.
They approached the arbour with torches, at the very
moment this bloody deed was perpetrated, and in the
confusion
that
ensued
, Fitz-Howard
escaped
. The
apparently
lifeless
bodies were
raised
, and borne into
the
house
.
Isabelle
in a few moments recovered, but
the
soul
of Dudley was fled forever.
The
despair
of his mother was great, yet was it not
to be compared with the
anguish
of heart under which
the unfortunate
Isabelle
suffered
; for to the
loss
of the
being
she
prized
most
on earth, was added the
reproaches
of her aunt, and the
resentment
of her father.
In the
first
moments of her
sorrow
she
disclosed
the
secret
of their marriage, and lady Dudley, far from
blaming
herself
as the author of the fatal
catastrophe
,
told the heart broken
Isabelle
, it was a
just
punishment
(no doubt
sent
from Heaven) for her
disobedience
and
unlawful love.
Sir Ferdinando forbade her his
presence
, and
she
was driven from the
house
of her aunt by repeated
taunts and upbraidings. As the widow of Dudley,
she
was in affluent
circumstances
; but of what value
is wealth to the
possessor
,
When each fond affection is fled,
And each
sense
of
pleasure
lies cold.
She could not be
said
to live; it was barely
existence
;
existence
not worth
preserving
, yet obliged to
be endured.
At length
she
became a mother, and the
tenderness
,
the cares and
pleasures
naturally attendant on the
maternal
character, awakened her dormant
sensibility
.
Her feelings were not dead, only benumbed; as the
limpid
stream
,
arrested
in its
course
by the chilly hand
of winter, becomes
stagnant
, nay,
almost
an
impenetrable
mass
, till the infant
spring
, with genial warmth,
gradually
dissolves
the frigid
spell
; when it again
proceeds in its
usual
meanders, beautifying and
fertilizing
every meadow through which it
passes
. So
the mind of
Isabelle
, awakened from its torpid
state
by her infant
son
, expanded to receive the new-born
pleasure
of rearing and
instructing
him. Every fond
affection of her
soul
centered in him, and if
she
studied
to improve her mind, it was ever with the
delightful
hope of
transmitting
that improvement to the mind
of her child.
From the day of Henry's death, the lady Dudley
had declined, and
she
died without forgiving
Isabelle
.
Sir Ferdinando's
resentment
had been powerful,
but his affection towards his daughter was greater;
and when there was no longer any one to keep the
former awake, it grandually died away, and the latter
revived with all its primitive
servor
. He
sent
for his
daughter, was reconciled to her, and breaking up his
own
household
, became an inmate in her
mansion
. His
grandson
amused
his
solitary
hours, and made the
chords of
sensibility
vibrate in delicious harmony;
whilst
Isabelle
, with cheerful, unaffected, filial piety,
softened
the pillow of declining age, and
strewed
the
path that leads but to the grave, with flowers
so
sweet
,
its rude
descent
was
scarce
perceptible; nor did one
thorn or briar appear, to impede the journey or to
wound the
soct
, that
must
per force
pass
over it.
Young Dudley was
christened
Edward; For
alas!
said
his mother, Henry was an unfortunate
name.
Caressed
,
almost
idelized by his grandfather,
and educated immediately under his own eye, Edward
almost
imperceptibly imbibed the enterprizing
spirit
that had characterized his
ancestors
.
He delighted in
conversing
with Otooa, a native
of North-America, who was a
servant
to Sir
Ferdinando
.
His little heart would bound with
transport
at the
description
of
vast
oceans,
immeasurable
continents
,
and climes as yet unexplored by Europeans;
and,
seized
with an
irresistible
desire
to
visit
the new
world in America, in the year 1632, embarked for
New-England. His inquiring nature found ample
gratification, in
observing
in this novel
seene
, the
various
flowers, plants,
shrubs
, infects, birds and animals,
to which the European world were
strangers
. Simple
in his manners, rational in his opinions, and truly
sincere
in his
professions
of piety, Edward Dudley became
a favourite in the colony. And when the death of
his grandfather called him home, he was parted with
unwillingly, and with
sincere
regret.
He married in the year 1644 the lady Arrabella
Ruthven; and the troubles in England
soon
after
increasing
,
on account of the
persecution
of
dissenters
,
whose
religious tenets Dudley favoured, he
sold
his
estates
; and,
purchasing
a
vessel
, which he loaded
with
provisions
, farming
utensils
, and
some
merchandize
,
himself
and lady, (who from that time was
styled
dame Arrabella) with an
extensive
household
,
embarked
for New-
Hampshire
, and landed, after a
fatiguing
voyage, in October, 1645, in tolerable health, and
most
excellent
spirits
.

Bidding the tranced fancy fly
O'er oceans
vast
from
shore
to
shore
.
Dudley
and his fair companion having
transported
over, in the
vessel
with
themselves
, the
frame, and every material
necessary
to form a
complete
habitation, immediately on landing, employed
workmen to
set
it up; but the cold coming on more
rapidly than they expected, but little
progress
could
be made that winter, and Arrabella
suffered
much
inconvenience
from the want of
those
indulgencies to
which, from her birth,
she
had been
accustomed
. But
she
was not a woman to complain for trifles, or, having
once embarked in a
cause
,
easily
to be frighted from
pursuing
it.
The inclemency of the winter was accordingly
passed
over with patience, and as
soon
as the enlivening
sun
relaxed
the
springs
and called the tender herbage forth,
two apartments in their new
house
being rendered
habitable
,
she
exerted her
utmost
endeavours to add a
degree
of
neatness
and elegance to what was
absolutely
necessary
for comfort. All the
accomplishments
she
possessed
, were at her
leisure
hours exerted to
embellish
and render their dwelling
pleasant
. It was
situated
above ten miles from the
sea
.
Dudley had, on his
first
arrival,
purchased
a large
tract of uncultivated land. Having got a
small
portion
of it clear, immediately
surrounding
his
habitation
,
Arrabella, both by her
taste
, and knowledge in
agriculture,
assisted
in rendering it at once
pleasant
and
serviceable
. Part of it was converted into a
kitchen garden, to the cultivation of which Arrabella
was particularly attentive. With her own hands
would
she
weed, water, or
transplant
the young
vegetables
;
and having
sown
a few flower
seeds
which
she
had brought with her from Europe, the watching a
plant as it advanced in growth, or a bud as it
gradually
disclosed
the opening flower, afforded her the
most
innocent
satisfaction
; and from this
constant
attention
to her garden,
she
gleaned at once
employment
,
health and
amusement
.
But Arrabella did not neglect her needle; and
when the
ensuing
year produced them a
small
quantity
of flax from their own land, with what exulting
pride did
she
purchase
a wheel, and
set
about
manufacturing
it into linen for her family
use
!
Delightful age of primitive
simplicity
, when the
mother of a numerous family did not
blush
(though
surrounded
by affluence) to
set
the example of
industry
to her daughters; when
she
would
preside
amongst
them,
whilst
they were converting the produce of
their father's flocks and fields into clothing for the
family. And with what a laudable pride did
she
look
round on her
husband
, her children and
servants
, and
say
, That cloth, that linen,
those
gowns, are all of
our own manufacturing.
Their wants were few, and
those
few were amply
supplied
; plenty
presided
at their board, and
cheerfulness
was a
constant
inmate in their dwellings. But
indolence introduced luxury with her innumerable
train of artificial wants. Though at
first
repulsed
,
still
would the
forceress
return, varying her
shape
to
gain her favourite point; to pride,
she
took the form
of
necessity
; to the voluptuous,
she
wore the
semblance
of indulgence; to each
she
appeared in
some
seductive
form, and none but the truly
industrious
hand and
contented heart could bid defiance to her arts. Alas!
the number was but
small
that
escaped
the contagion
she
spread
through all ranks of people, till at length
the
fascination
became
universal
. By her magic
power
she
threw a
mist
over the
discerning
optics of even
the
most
rational; they
saw
not the deformity
she
concealed under her gorgeous robe, but blindly
worshipped
,
whilst
she
led them to the very brink of ruin.
A few years rendered the habitation of Dudley and
Arrabella extremely delightful, and, added to other
numerous comforts and
blessings
which they enjoyed,
was a
rising
family of beautiful children. How did
this family at once
increase
the
pleasures
and the cares
of their
respectable
mother! Anxious not only for their
present
but future
happiness
,
she
laboured to cultivate
their
understandings
, and point out to them
sources
of
mental
pleasure
, that would delightfully fill up every
moment when employment
paused
.
The morning walk, the evening ramble,
still
afforded
something
to
instruct
and improve. Non was the
winter evening
sterile
or unprofitable. Edifying
conversation
,
books and needle-work, charmingly
diversisied
the
scene
, blending the
useful
with the agreeable.
It was in the
summer
of 1661, the
eldest
child of
Dudley, a
son
named William, who was about fifteen
years old, and his
youngest
, a daughter called Rachel,
scarcely
two, when
some
disagreements
having fallen
out between the native Indians and the
English
settlers
,
the former frequently made inroads on the latter,
plundering
and burning their habitations, and either
massacreing
the inhabitants, or taking them
prisoners
and
carrying them up the country, where they often
exercised
on them the
most
wanton barbarity;
scalping
,
maiming and disfiguring them, if at
last
they
suffered
them to
escape
with life. But what could be
expected
from the untaught
savage
,
whose
territories had
been invaded by
strangers
, and who perhaps had
suffered
,
from the cruelty of the invaders, in the
person
of a father, brother,
son
, or
some
near connexion.
Revenge is a principle inherent in human nature, and
it is only the
sublime
and heavenly doctrine of
Christianity
that teaches us to repel the
impulse
, and return
good for evil.
The morning was fine. Cheerful had Arrabella
arose
, and,
surrounded
by her little family, joined with
their father in their morning adorations to the Giver
of all good. This
indispensable
duty performed,
Dudley
went to
superintend
his mowers; and his wife,
calling her girls, to the number of five, together, began
the
usual
task
of
instruction
. But the little Rachel
was not inclined to be quiet;
she
was more inclined
for play than
sitting
still
. She climbed up in her
mother's lap,
kissed
her, and in
childish
sport
threw
the book on the floor.
It is
impossible
to attend
seriously
to any thing,
said
her mother,
whilst
this little mad-cap is here.
Do, William, take her into the garden. William
obeyed, and from the garden
strayed
into an adjoining
wood, where, intent on a book which his father had
desired
him to
peruse
with attention, he
suffered
the
little prattler to play round, pluck flowers, and catch
grasshoppers
.
Arrabella was
pursuing
her employment, with all
the delight a fond mother can feel, who marks the
daily improvement of her children, and
sees
them
eagerly
striving
who
should
foremost
reach the goal of
perfection, when an old
servant
, the only male then
about the
house
,
rushed
into the apartment,
exclaiming
,
with looks of horror, The natives! the natives!
Starting from her
seat
with precipitation,
she
turned
towards the window, and
saw
a band of
savages
crossing
through a field of corn, not very far from the
house
. Fly! fly! my children,
she
cried, taking
the two
youngest
by the hand; and followed by the
eldest
, they
rushed
out of a door that led a contrary
way to the road the
savages
were coming.
There was in the very wood where William had
wandered with his infant
sister
, a cavern formed by
the cunning hand of nature, the
recesses
of which
Arrabella
had in days of
happiness
frequently explored.
Her
presence
of mind in this terrifying exigence did
not
forsake
her. With
hasty
, yet trembling
steps
,
she
led her children thither; nor was it till
resting
on the
ground in its
remotest
winding, when
she
felt her five
children hanging about her, that
she
recollected
William
and Rachel.
Oh! my children! my children! exclaimed
she
,
suddenly
starting
up. We are all here, mother,
they
answered
with united voices.
But where! Oh where! cried
she
franticly,
is your brother William, and your
sister
Rachel?
Oh! my poor brother, my dear,
sweet
little
sister
,
said
the children
severally
; let us go back, mother,
let us go back and look for them.
No, my darlings, no!
she
replied,
sinking
again
on the ground, and drawing them
closer
towards her;
that would indeed be to
suffer
you to run into the
very claws of the
destroyer
. The great God of
heaven
and earth
inspired
me with the thought of
bringing
you here for
safety
; he will, I
trust
, protect us;
and his power to protect and
save
, even from the jaws
of death, is equal throughout this wide-extended
universe
.
He can guard all your brothers, your
sister
,
and your father too. Let us kneel, my children, and
implore his mercy.
At the mention of their father, and the recollection
of their brothers, Charles, James and
Christopher
, who
were in the field with him, the girls wept aloud.
Arrabella
poured forth her
soul
in fervent prayer, and
the kneeling innocents, in broken accents,
sobbed
amen
.
The female
servants
, terrified at the approach of
the
savages
, in their
eagerness
to elude them ran
directly
into their power, and
instantly
became victims
to their fury. They
dispatched
them with their
tomahawks
,
and,
stripping
off their
scalps
, kept them as
proofs of their endeavours to extirpate the
English
from
amongst
them. The man who had alarmed his
mistress
ran out of the
house
by the
same
way
she
had
taken; but thinking it would be right to alarm his
master
,
instead
of following her, made the
best
of his
way to the field where the mowers were at work.
The
savages
having rifled the
house
of
provisions
,
wearing apparel, and every thing which they
conceived
would be any ways
serviceable
to
themselves
,
set
fire to it, and then departed, with horrid yells of
exultation
at having done all the
mischief
in their power
to an
English
family. William was, at the moment
the flames
burst
forth,
just
returning with his little
sister
. His father's
house
on fire, and a band of
Indians
in frantic rage
hastening
towards them, was
a
sight
that filled with the
most
horrid
presages
the
breast
of William. He
saw
there would be no way
to
escape
them;
so
,
clasping
the infant Rachel in his
arms, he knelt on the ground, fear
almost
suspending
every faculty.
One of the
foremost
of the
savage
troop had
raised
his tomahawk to
dispatch
the boy; but the child, with
one arm clinging to her brother's neck, extended the
other little innocent hand as if to ward off the blow,
and
screaming
, cried, Don'tee, don'tee. At that
moment a
squaw
, who held a
papouse
at her
breast
,
threw
herself
before the
suppliant
children, and
said
in
their own language, You
shall
not kill the infant.
The attempt
seemed
to have been the
impulse
of the
moment, for it required but little
persuasion
to turn
the Indian from his
purpose
; he dropped the
instrument
of death; William
started
from the ground, ran
to the kind hearted woman,
kissed
her hands, bathed
O
them with his tears, and pointing to the
sky
, gave her
to
understand
, that the Power who dwelt above that
azure firmament would reward her. Her own infant
being
returned to her back, (the mode in which the
Indian
women in general carry their children)
she
took
Rachel in her arms; and William being made to
assist
in carrying their plunder, they proceeded on
their march; a weary march it was to the poor little
captives.
Otawee, for that was the name of their
protectress
,
did all
she
could to make little Rachel
easy
, but
she
continued at intervals to cry for her mother; and
William, his feet lacerated by the
sharp
flints and
thorns he encountered in the rugged paths through
which he was obliged to
pass
, his heart bleeding for
what he thought
must
have been the fate of his
beloved
parents, brothers and
sisters
, proceeded as well as
he could till towards the evening of the
second
day,
when, overcome with fatigue, grief and long
fasting
,
(for he could not eat the food they offered him) he fell
fainting to the earth. Fortunately they were now
near the end of their march, or it is more than
probable
the unfortunate boy would have been left to
perish
in the woods. As it was, two young Indians bore
him between them to the water-
side
, put him in a
canoe
,
and Otawee
sitting
down
beside
him, threw
water
on his face,
raised
his head on her knee, and
forcing
him to
swallow
a little
spirits
, he by degrees
recovered
.
This party of plunderers were natives of
Narhaganset
.
Two or three unprincipled and licentious
Europeans having made
incursions
amongst
them,
plundering their little
settlements
, burning their
wigwams
,
and
practising
other enormities, as
must
certainly
awaken a
spirit
of revenge in the
bosom
of
persons
better regulated than
those
of untutored
savages
;
several
families who had been particularly injured,
formed
themselves
into a party, and embarking in their
canoes, proceeded up Connecticut river, landing
wherever
they thought there was no fear of
opposition
,
and wreaking their vengeance on the unguarded and
innocent inhabitants.
Dudley had, from his
first
settlement
, been a man
of
peace;
happy in his family, fully employed in
cultivating
and improving his little domain, he
stepped
not out of his own
domestic
concerns, except it was to
assist
a neighbour, (for any European family,
settled
within twenty miles, was at that early period termed
a neighbour) or to
instruct
a new
settler
in the
best
mode of clearing his lands; to which
instructions
he
ever readily added any help his
servants
,
horses
, oxen,
or even
himself
could give.
Such a man could hardly be
supposed
an object of
enmity to any; but his habitation had been marked
by an Indian who had
strayed
from his companions.
Its lonely
situation
, its
flourishing
appearance, which
promised
plenty of plunder without fear of
opposition
,
determined them to attack it; but when they had
committed this outrage on a quiet,
inoffensive
family,
they well knew it would not be long before they were
pursued
. They accordingly made all the
haste
they
could to the place where they had left their canoes,
and embarking with the plunder they had obtained,
proceeded immediately home. On their way thither,
meeting with a party who came from the more
eastern
parts; and, fearful that the young captives they had,
might, if
seen
, betray them to the
English
, they
sold
them, and William and Rachel were carried to a
greater
distance
than it could hardly be believed
possible
for the Indians to proceed in their little birch
canoes
.
When being landed on a very wild and totally
uncultivated place, they were marched three days
journey from the
sea
-
shore
, and
presented
to the
squaw
of their
sachem
for
servants
.
Otooganoo was a man naturally gentle, fond of
peace, and eager in his endeavours to promote the
welfare of his people. He had ever recommended to
them to treat the
strangers
who were come to
settle
amongst
them with
hospitality
; but it was not in his
power to
restrain
the
impetuosity
of youth, or to curb
the licentious hand of the rapacious. When the
young captives were brought to his wigwam, he
rebuked
those
who brought them, and bade William to
banish
all his fears; for he would be a father to him,
and, if ever opportunity offered,
restore
him to his
natural parent. His wife was particularly
pleased
with little Rachel, and the
kindness
of
these
two good
Indians rendered the lives of the brother and
sister
as comfortable as the nature of their
situation
would
admit of.
CHAP. XVII.
Real Afflictions.
At
the alarm given by the
servant
mentioned in
the preceding chapter, Mr. Dudley,
accompanied
by his labourers and little
sons
, made all
possible
haste
to the
house
; but who can
describe
his feelings,
when he beheld the
mansion
where he had taken his
morning's
repast
in all the
security
of
conscious
innocence
of heart, and in which he had left
those
treasures
of his
soul
, his wife and
seven
children, a heap of
smoking
ruins? When he beheld,
stretched
on the earth,
the mangled bodies of his female
servants
, the
fortitude
of the man was
lost
in the
anguish
of the
husband
and father. He
raised
his hands and eyes in agony
towards heaven, his heart was too much
oppressed
to
allow even the relief of tears, and he fell
lifeless
to the
ground. His three
sons
endeavoured to
raise
him,
they called repeatedly on his name, and finding he
remained
totally
insensible
, wrung their hands, and wept
with
convulsive
violence.
At length nature, which had been only
stunned
by
the
suddenness
and
greatness
of the affliction, in
some
measure
revived. He
raised
his eyes, he
cast
them on
his weeping boys, and as if, at the
sight
of them,
recollecting
that it was a
signal
mercy that they were
saved
from the general wreck, he endeavoured to
repel
the
sensibility
that had overpowered him, and
summon
resolution
to
search
round the garden, fields and
out-
houses
,
some
of which had
escaped
the fury of the
Indians.
But in vain he
sought
, in vain he repeatedly called
on Arrabella and her children; not a
vestige
of them
could he find. That they
escaped
out of the
house
before the
savages
entered, the
servant
had informed
him; but their
weakness
from age and
sex
, he
imagined
,
would prevent their going far. They might be
overtaken in their flight. They might be carried
into
captivity. A
thousand
conjectures
presented
themselves
to his
distracted
thoughts, but none of them
glanced towards the right. At length, weary and
heart-broken, he was
persuaded
by his
servants
to go,
with the remains of his family, to the
nearest
European
settlement
. Accordingly, they put the children
in a cart, and Mr. Dudley mounting a
horse
, the
labourers
followed in the
best
manner they were able,
and late at night they arrived at Plymouth; where
the relation of the
sad
events of the day filled the
whole
settlement
with alarm. Every one was ready
to
sympathize
with the
respected
Dudley, and their
sympathy
was doubly cordial, as in pitying him, each
father of a family felt it might have been his own
case
.
But to return to the afflicted mother and her
daughters
.
Never was a day and a night
passed
in more
agony, never did day and night appear
so
tedious;
the mother, trembling for the fate of her children, and
in her own mind certain that her
husband
and their
father had fallen victims to their
savage
foe,
shuddered
at every
blast
of wind that howled through the
dreary cavern, thinking it was the yell of the Indians.
And if, during the long, long night, weary nature
paused
in momentary
forgetfulness
,
she
would
start
with
redoubled terror, and call on her children
severally
,
fearing,
whilst
she
had
ceased
to watch, they might
have been
snatched
from her.
Several times did
she
venture
almost
to the mouth
of the
recess
; but the
rustling
of the trees, the
sound
of animals' feet, which
she
mistook
for human, would
make her run back; and nothing but the
most
pressing
O 2
calls of hunger, which her children began to
express
by loud and impatient cries, could have driven her at
last
from her retreat.
She ventured at
last
entirely to quit it, and with
feeble
steps
led her
almost
famished
little group towards
the place where their
mansion
had
stood
; but alas!
no
mansion
was there. Faint and
dispirited
,
she
sat
down on a rock, and gave free vent to the agony of
her
soul
.
Do not cry
so
, mother,
said
the
eldest
girl, her
own voice
almost
choked with
sobs
. I am very
hungry,
said
a younger one.
Oh! my children! my children! cried the
distracted
mother, we
must
all
perish
together. Your
father is no more; your mother has neither bread to
give you, or where to
shelter
you from the inclemency
of the weather,
unless
we return to the cavern, and I
fear we are too much
exhausted
to reach even that
asylum
again to-night.
There is the corn-barn, mother,
said
one of them,
let us go there. Arrabella
consented
; they
entered
it, and
some
few grains of Indian corn being
scattered
here and there, the children gathered them up,
and ate them with avidity. But it was a kind of
food, however faint and
exhausted
, their mother could
not
swallow
. From the ruins of the
house
they
brought part of an earthen pan; this they took to the
spring
,
washed
it clean, and took it full of water to
her. She drank, and was in
some
small
degree
refreshed
.
Arrabella had it in contemplation to go to
Plymouth
;
but her own
increasing
weakness
, and the
extreme
youth of two of her girls, made her reject the
idea as impracticable; added to which, in the
afternoon
was a heavy
tempest
of thunder, lightning, rain
and wind, which would have made
such
a journey
almost
impossible
, even in the
best
circumstances
.
During the whole night, the
tempest
continued;
and in the morning this unfortunate mother was
so
reduced
by
anguish
of heart and continued
fasting
, added
to the damp of the floor on which
she
lay, which had
given her a violent cold and
stiffened
all her limbs, as
to find
herself
totally unable to
rise
. She firmly
believed
her
last
hour was at hand, and recommending
her children to the protection of the Almighty,
she
lay in
silent
and uncomplaining expectation of
terminating
a life, in which
she
had enjoyed a very large
share
of
happiness
, and which, deprived of its chief
comfort in the
chosen
friend and partner of her heart,
had now no longer any charms for her.
The elder girls, by
searching
abroad, had procured
some
little
sustenance
from the fields and hedges;
and this they would have gladly
shared
with their
sisters
;
but alas! poor innocents, they were too far
exhausted
to be revived by the participation. They lay
on the floor
beside
their mother, and a faint moan,
expressive
of their
sufferings
, was the only
sign
they
gave of
existence
.
The third morning dawned from the time of the
enemy's
invasion
, and
still
no hope of relief
presented
itself
to the mind of Arrabella; and indeed to
such
a
state
was
she
reduced, that hope, fear, every lively
sentiment
was extinct, and a torpid
despair
had taken
entire
possession
of her
soul
.
Dudley, from
excessive
anxiety, was
so
very ill as
to be unable to leave his bed. The three boys were
stationary
in his chamber; they hung over him, they
administered
every
nourishment
or medicine the
doctor
prescribed
.
Whilst
he
slept
, they waited in
trembling
silence
, and when he awoke, eagerly
strove
who
should
receive his
first
request
, and fly to comply
with it.
But the old
servant
and one of the labourers, after
taking the matter over one evening,
resolved
upon
visiting
the
scene
of
desolation
the
ensuing
morning, to
see
if any thing worth
preservation
could be found
amongst
the ruins. It need hardly be mentioned,
that in
those
early days,
superstition
, (the natural
attendant
on ignorant minds and contracted educations)
pervaded the
understandings
of
almost
every
class
of
people.
During the walk of old Philip and his companion,
from Plymouth to the demain of Dudley, their
conversation
had turned chiefly on
spirits
, haunted
houses
,
and
supernatural
appearances of every kind. Philip
affirmed, that it was his belief, innocent blood was
never
spilt
, but that the
spirit
of the departed, nightly
visited
the
spot
where it had been driven from its earthly
tabernacle, and called for vengeance on the murderer;
nor would it be at peace till that vengeance was
executed
.
And for my part, continued he with great
earnestness
, his
astonished
auditor (who not knowing
how to read and write his own name, looked upon
Philip, who could, as a wonder of learning)
listening
with
astonishment
, for my part, I would no more go
to
these
ruins after
sunset
, than I would put my hand
into a burning fire; for I have no doubt but my poor
mistress
and her dear little ones And here he
paused
to give vent to a
gush
of tears, and then, as if
thinking
such
weakness
in a man required an
excuse
,
he added, She was a good
mistress
; we all loved her
like a mother.
Yes, that we did, replied his companion; I
shall
never
see
the likes of her.
Don't
say
that, replied Philip; I hope there be
many as good; but I am morally certain it be an
unpossibility
to find a better. But as I was
saying
, I
dares to
say
,
she
do walk over the ruins every night,
and with her dear little girls. Oh! mercy on me,
what's that? Only that it be noon-day, or I
should
think
As I am a
sinner
,
said
the other, I do
see
summat
as like little Eliza.
They
stopped
, they gazed upon what at the
moment
they believed a
vision
; it was the
eldest
daughter
of Dudley, who, having
strayed
toward the road
in the hope of
seeing
some
human being, of whom
she
might
solicit
help for her dying mother and
sisters
,
she
saw
Philip approaching, and
instantly
knew him.
The
excess
of her joy had nearly proved fatal to her,
and
she
sunk
down
amongst
some
bushes
, which
instantaneously
concealing her, the
simple
clowns
imagined
she
had
vanished
.
Well, could not you have
sworn
you
saw
her?
said
Philip.
Yes, indeed, replied the other, I would take
my bible oath of it.
They had now got nearly
opposite
the
shrubs
which
concealed her. The poor child had not entirely
fainted
;
but her languid frame, overcome by the
sudden
flood of
transport
that
rushed
on her heart at the fight
of a human creature, and one
she
knew, had
occasioned
a momentary
suspension
of her faculties. She heard
their
steps
as they approached nearer, and
raising
herself
on her knees, cried, Philip, dear, good Philip!
at the
same
time extending her hand towards him.
Philip trembled,
stood
aghast
, and
struggled
for
breath. His companion covered his face with his hat,
and fell on his knees. But Eliza
soon
dissipated
their
fears, by coming feebly towards them, again
repeating
,
Philip, dear Philip! Then
earnestly
clasping
her hands,
she
added, Come, come, and
save
my
mother.
Fearful conjecture was now
lost
in joyful certainty.
It is Eliza
herself
, cried Philip, catching her up in
his arms. She is alive! Oh! thank God! thank
God! And my
mistress
too. How did you
escape
the Indians? Oh! this will cure my
master
; this
will make him forget his other
losses
; they are
nothing
.
A man may build another
house
, but where
could he find another wife like my worthy madam
Dudley
?
They now, directed by Eliza, had reached the place
where,
scarcely
existing
, lay the
despairing
Arrabella.
One child lay on her left arm, its head
resting
on her
bosom
; another lay at her feet, to all appearance
inanimate
;
a third was
seated
at a little
distance
,
supporting
in her feeble arms a younger
sister
.
Oh merciful!
said
Philip; good father, what's
here? My
mistress
and my
sweet
little ladies all dying.
Go run, turning to the labourer, run back to town,
tell them to
send
a cart, to
send
victuals and drink,
and a
nurse
and a doctor, with bed and a
bedstead
,
and every thing. Good Sirs, what
shall
I do? Why
don't you run? What do you
stand
for?
In this manner did Philip exclaim, walking
backward
and forward in wild
disorder
; one moment
stopping
to gaze at the pale and
almost
inanimate form
of Arrabella, and the next running from one child to
the other,
sometimes
weeping,
sometimes
bidding
them to be hearty, and frequently
searching
his
pockets
,
as though he could in them find
something
to
satisfy
their hunger.
Extreme
sensibility
is often not only painful to the
possessor
, but prejudicial to
those
whom we may
wish
to
serve
. Philip, with a
soul
exquisitely
formed to
dictate all the
soft
offices of humanity, was not
so
capable
of rendering a real
service
to his
distressed
mistress
,
as was the labourer, who,
simply
comprehending
the
necessity
of immediate relief being obtained,
exerted his
utmost
speed
to return to Plymouth, where,
explaining the nature and urgency of his errand, a
short
time only
elapsed
before, with an
easy
conveyance
,
restorative
cordials, and
several
women, he again
reached the
desolated
mansion
of Dudley.
The meeting between Arrabella, her
husband
and
children, was too pathetic to admit of
description
.
The joy
such
an unexpected meeting
occasioned
, would
have been too
exquisite
for human nature to
support
,
had it not been allayed by the certainty that William
and Rachel were
lost
beyond hope of recovery. With
hearts overflowing with
transport
, they
blessed
God
that eight of their children were living; and though
they acutely felt the
loss
of two, yet gratitude
tempered
affliction, and prevented their repining at the
decrees of Him,
whose
judgments ever go hand in
hand with his mercies.
When Dudley's health was in
some
measure
restored
,
he began to think of preparing another habitation
before the approach of winter; but no
persuasion
could prevail on him to
suffer
another
house
to be
erected on the
spot
where he had formerly lived. He
even took a
dislike
to the whole colony of
New-Hampshire
,
and
selling
his lands, he joined a number of
persons
,
at that time about to make a
settlement
at
Casco-Bay
.
It was in vain Arrabella
represented
to him the
difficulty
of clearing and cultivating a new
spot
; his
mind had never regained its
firmness
after the
shock
it had received, and he
persisted
in removing, from
the
bosom
of his friends, to an uncultivated
wilderness
.
But Arrabella was no longer in her prime. The
brilliant genius and
industrious
hands which had
contributed
to improve and
embellish
their former
dwelling
,
debilitated by
sickness
and
sorrow
, had
sunk
into
inanity.
For fifteen years, Dudley and his wife
suffered
almost
every
species
of affliction which human nature
can endure and live. The throat-
distemper
raged,
and in ten days
swept
off all their children; the cold
Arrabella had contracted in the cavern, and
sleeping
on the damp floor of the corn-barn, had given her a
rheumatic complaint, which often confined her eight
months out of the twelve. Dudley
sought
, in the
society
of his neighbours, a relief from reflection; and
his intellectual faculties were
so
weakened, that he
easily
became the dupe of the artful or avaricious,
and his
sixtieth
birth-day beheld him poor in
purse
,
depressed
in
spirit
, and devoid of health.
And if virtue, piety and integrity are thus
overwhelmed
with
misery
, (
asks
the man who
professes
infidelity) who can believe in an over-ruling Power,
who
punishes
the evil doer, and rewards the good
according
to their works?
All
must
, all do, who do not wilfully harden their
hearts, and
shut
their eyes
against
the light of
Heaven
,
replies the humbly hoping
Christian
; for as
the
mansion
of an earthly king is adorned by gold
seven
times tried,
silver
purified by fire, and precious
stones
, which, ere they attain a proper brilliancy,
must
submit
to the knife, the
saw
, or
chissel
of the
artist
;
so
must
those
souls
,
destined
to
shine
in the
everlasting
mansion
of the King of kings,
pass
through the
fiery ordeal of affliction, be purified, and
polished
by
the correcting finger of the great Source and
First
Cause
of all
symmetry
and beauty.
CHAP. XVIII.
William and Rachel.
In
the year 1674, the war between the native
Americans
and the European
settlers
raged with
uncommon
fury. William Dudley, who had, with his
little
sister
, been carried into captivity in 1661, had
now become a
personage
of great
consequence
amongst
them. Otooganoo, the
sachem
to whom he had been
presented
,
possessing
talents naturally good, and
thirsting
for knowledge, yet unable to attain it,
soon
learnt,
from his
conversations
with William, that he could in
some
measure
gratify this very laudable
desire
to be
instructed
. William, though young, had, by
attention
to the documents of his father and the milder
instructions
of his mother, obtained a very decent
knowledge
of reading, writing, arithmetic, geography and
history
.
Otooganoo no
sooner
made this
discovery
, than
William became to him the
most
valuable thing he
possessed
. I will certainly
restore
him to his
European
friends,
said
he, but he
shall
first
teach me all
he knows. In the mean time, I will be kind to him,
nor
shall
his little
sister
ever want a friend or
protector
;
as
soon
as he has imparted to me his
stock
of
knowledge, I will certainly
send
him to his friends.
Thus argued Otooganoo. But, alas! human
nature
will be human nature; and when the period
arrived
that he had gleaned all the knowledge poor
William had to impart, his heart was
so
attached to
him, his
society
had afforded him
so
many days,
months, years of real felicity, that he made to his own
conscience
daily
fresh
excuses
for not
sending
him from
him.
William
himself
, though he frequently
spoke
of
them, and
expressed
a
wish
to
see
his parents, no
longer
felt that ardent
desire
to return to them, which he
experienced in the early days of his captivity. He
had become
insensibly
attached to Otooganoo; and
as, from the effects of his
instructions
, his protector had
made rapid advances towards civilization, had entirely
lost
his natural ferocity, and attained
such
a degree of
rational information as made him a
pleasant
companion
,
William felt that attachment daily
increase
.
Otooganoo had a daughter. Oberca was full five
years younger than William;
she
was tall,
straight
,
and finely formed. She was, at the time of his
arrival
amongst
them, a lively girl of ten years old,
wild as the rein-deer, that with fleet
steps
bounds
over the frozen plains of Lapland, and untutored as
it is
possible
for a human being to be. Her looks, her
words, her actions, were the genuine
impulses
of
nature
.
As the little Rachel
increased
in years, it was the
employment of her brother's
leisure
hours, to
instruct
her in the
English
language in the
best
manner
possible
.
The book he had with him, on the morning of
his capture, was of infinite
assistance
to him, as by
looking at that, he was enabled to form a very tolerable
alphabet upon bark,
using
some
of their
strong
dye
instead
of ink; and this alphabet
served
alike,
Otooganoo
,
Rachel and Oberea, who delighted in partaking
their
lessons
, and profited daily by his
instructions
.
Educated under the immediate eye of a woman like
Arrabella, it may naturally be
supposed
, William,
though young, had imbibed very
strong
and
just
ideas
of female delicacy and decorum, and
these
ideas he
laboured
incessantly
to
impress
on the mind of his
sister
. Oberea
listened
attentively, and
treasured
every
sentence
he uttered in her heart. She had heard him
tell his
sister
, that his country-women were the
most
charming women in the world, and Oberea early
formed
the
wish
of being thought charming in the eyes of
William. This
wish
was a powerful
talisman
to
correct
the bad effects of habit, and at the age of
seventeen
,
P
she
was
so
much
superior
in manner to her
uncivilized
associates
, that William, without being aware
of it, adored the lovely
statue
his art had animated.
He was not
sensible
of the
excess
of his
tenderness
for the charming Indian, till an accident, by nearly
depriving him of her, convinced him at once how
necessary
she
was to his
happiness
. Some Indians, who
dwelt in the town with them, having by traffic with
the Europeans, who inhabited the
sea
-
coasts
,
procured
two or three
musquets
, one was brought and
presented
to Otooganoo, who being mightily
pleased
with
the
present
, loaded it, with a
design
of going out in
pursuit
of game; but not putting his
design
in
immediate
execution, it was left
standing
in one corner of
the wigwam. A young
savage
, particularly attached
to Oberea, took it up to examine it, and not
understanding
how to handle it properly, touched the
trigger
.
It went off, and the contents were lodged in
the right
side
of Oberea.
William heard the report, and the
instant
cries of
his
sister
; he flew to them, and entering,
saw
both his
sister
and her he now found he loved equal with her,
lying on the ground, which was covered with blood.
The young man, frantic at what had happened, told
what he had done, and that he feared he had killed
both the girls; but Rachel's fall was the effect of
sudden
surprise
, and it was
soon
discovered
she
was not
in the
least
hurt. But Oberea wounded, to all
appearance
dying, was an object
distracting
to William.
He
raised
her in his arms, called aloud for help, and
having
assisted
his
sister
and an old
squaw
, to
staunch
the blood, and bind up the wounds, which were
chiefly
in the
fleshy
part of the arm, and having
seen
her
open her eyes, and
sign
to him that
she
knew him, he
walked backwards and forwards, watching her as
she
dozed,
sometimes
applying a feather to her mouth to
be
satisfied
she
still
breathed, and often kneeling down
to
kiss
her hand, which lay
motionless
on the
outside
of the bed.
Otooganoo, during the time
she
was thought in
danger,
observed
the extreme
solicitude
of William,
and when
she
was perfectly recovered, thus
addressed
him. You have been to me, young
Englishman
, a
friend, a companion, an
instructor
, now above eight
years. I love you with
sincerity
, and I believe you
love me.
Do you doubt?
asked
William eagerly.
No, I do not for a moment doubt your
sincerity
.
But I have
also
discovered
that you love my
daughter
.
Your
counsels
and
instructions
have rendered her
unfit to match with any of her own countrymen; you
are now
almost
become one of us; take her, then, to
wife; and when age, infirmity or death
shall
occasion
me to
cease
from the cares of life,
supply
my place,
govern my people, direct them by your
wisdom
, teach
them the real value of well-
constructed
laws,
encourage
them in
studying
the arts of war; yet lead them,
by your example and forbearance, to cultivate a
social
and commercial
intercourse
, and to
preserve
peace
with your countrymen, who are become their
neighbours
,
as long as they can
preserve
it with honour.
William, weaned from his natural friends, tenderly
attached to Oberea, perhaps not altogether
insensible
to the charms of power, and harbouring a fond hope,
that by this union with the family of a
sachem
, he
might promote the
interests
of his countrymen in
general
,
and be the cement to bind them in bonds of
lasting
amity,
listened
with delighted attention, plighted
his vows of love and
constancy
to Otooganoo, and in
a few days ratified
those
vows, by binding
himself
, by
the
most
sacred
of all ties, to protect and love through
life his charming Oberea.
Otooganoo lived to
see
his
son
-in-law equally
beloved
and
respected
with
himself
, to embrace a
grandson
whom William called Reuben: For,
said
he, I
have been a bondman and a
servant
unto my wife's
father, and this my
first
born
shall
pay my
ransom
.
As the old
sachem
felt his hour approaching, he
called his chiefs, and the
oldest
men of his tribe, about
him; and taking the little Reuben in his arms,
whilst
Oberea, William and Rachel
stood
on his right hand,
thus
addressed
them:
Warriors and Chiefs, Natives and undoubted
Lords of this
vast
country,
listen
to your departing
father. I have ruled over you now above forty years;
I have ever found you obedient to my commands, and
affectionate to my family. But the great Spirit
whose
throne is on the
loftiest
mountain, and
whose
breath
passing
over the great lake, can make it rage even as
the wild tyger, when,
suddenly
springing
from his
secret
hiding-place, he tears and mangles his
defenceless
prey; or
softly
moving over its broad
surface
,
renders
it
smooth
, beautiful and enticing as is the
syren
,
who charms but to
destroy
; this wondrous,
incomprehensible
Spirit, who gave me life and motion,
recals
the precious gift, and in a
short
time I
shall
be
dust
.
Otooganoo
paused
; his whole
soul
was filled with
the
sublimity
of the BEING of whom he had been
speaking
, and a moment was given to feelings beyond
expression
exquisite
. Recovering the
firmness
of his
voice, he thus proceeded:
Friends, Countrymen, Children, had I a
son
, I
well know your unanimous
consent
would nominate
him my
successor
. Behold, then, the
son
of my
choice, the friend of my
soul
, the
husband
of my
daughter. He is brave, he is wife, he is humane!
alike competent to
prosecute
war with vigour, or
preserve
peace with honour. He is, you will
say
, a
son
of our invaders, of our common enemy. But
consider
them as enemies no longer. Bury the
warhatchet
twenty feet under ground, and
smoke
the
great pipe of peace,
whose
fragrance may
ascend
even
to the heaven of heavens. Hail
these
Europeans as
brethren, and follow henceforth their precept of doing
as you would be done by.
We will! we will! they all exclaimed; when
Otooganoo thus continued:
Chiefs, Elders and brother Warriors, in
recommending
to your choice this young man, I mean not
to
relinquish
the affection you have ever
shown
my
family. No. Behold this child, the
son
of my
daughter
;
in him you
see
your rightful
sachem
. But I am
passing
from this world to the land of
spirits
, and this
infant is incompetent to
supply
my place. Who then
so
able, who
so
worthy as his father, to govern and
direct
you, and
instruct
the young
sachem
how to guard
your liberties, and
preserve
your love inviolate.
Otoogano
ceased
, and an old warrior thus replied:
The offspring of Otooganoo, the
son
of Oberea, will
ever be honoured and
respected
. We are content to
receive, during his childhood, the
Englishman
William
,
and to adopt the new faith thou
hast
lately taught
and
practised
. As the Europeans deal by us,
so
deal
we by them, and the great Spirit judge us both.
Otooganoo
survived
this conference but a few days;
he
passed
(to
use
his own
expression
) to the land of
spirits
, and William Dudley was
chosen
sachem
in his
stead
, by the unanimous voice of the whole tribe.
As the Europeans deal by us,
so
deal we by them,
and the great Spirit judge us both. This was the
oath they took, and
most
religiously
did they keep it.
But if the
professors
of
Christianity
practise
not
themselves
what they would teach to others, who can blame
the
savage
, who (in
seeking
his own gratification, or
promoting his own
interest
, regards not the
happiness
or
interest
of a fellow creature) follows but the
example
set
him?
The new
settlers
made daily encroachments on the
native inhabitants, drove them from their lands,
robbed
them of their wives, and made their children
prisoners
.
Was it in human nature to bear
these
injuries
tamely? No; they
resented
them. And even
William
himself
, though his heart bled at what
must
be
the
consequence
, could not attempt to repel the
spirit
of
just
vengeance that actuated the minds of all. War
was declared on both
sides
, and
pursued
with
unremitting
fury.
Amongst
the young warriors that lived under the
government of William, was Yankoo. He was
intrepid
,
bold, and daring. He hated the Europeans; yet,
spite
of that hate which
seemed
inherent in his nature,
his heart was
susceptible
of
tenderness
for one of the
race. The beauty of Rachel had penetrated his
soul
.
P 2
He loved, revealed his love, and found it was
returned
.
The war continuing to rage it became neceary
for the fachem in peron to quit his home, and head his
warriors. The undaunted Oberea would follow her
huband to the field, and Rachel, though naturally
more timid, yet having her nerves new-trung by
affection
,
accompanied her. They encamped near the
ea-hore. By the morning's dawn they expected the
enemy.
Yankoo paed a few hours the preceding evening
in the wigwam of Oberea. "Oh! my friend," aid
Rachel, as he was parting from him, "be careful of
your own life for my ake; and if at any time your
tomahawk hould be raied againt an ancient
Englishman
,
paue for a moment, and think, perhaps it may
be the father of Rachel, and let the idea diarm your
rage."
"It would do o," replied Yankoo, "did I not at
the ame time remember, that every Englihman is
the enemy of my country."
"Would you not pare my father then?" aid
Rachel
.
"No! not even my own father in uch a caue,"
answered
the warrior, and broke from her embrace.
Rachel retired to her bed, and paed the night in
tears.
CHAP. XIX.
Long looked for come at lat--Reuben and Rachel born
THE ituation or feelings of William Dudley were
at this period by no means enviable. Ruler
over a nation of avages, who by their attachment
and fidelity had conciliated his aection, his principles
would by no means uffer him to deert their caue in
the hour of danger; yet remembering that his natural
parents were Europeans, and the tendernes he once
experienced for them not being extinct in his
bosom
,
he felt his heart divided between two
separate
interests
;
and if at any time a
skirmish
took place, he would
think that, perhaps,
amongst
the killed or wounded of
the enemy, he might have to lament a father or a
brother. And
whilst
he was publickly obliged to
appear
rejoiced at the
success
of the Indians, he would
privately lament the defeat of his own countrymen.
The
soul
of Rachel was equally agitated. Alas!
who can
describe
the feelings of a heart thus divided?
She dared not pray, for to which party could
she
wish
success
? Oh!
save
, protect and
support
my father,
she
would cry; then in a moment recollecting,
she
would wring her hands and cry, Oh! poor
Yankoo
.
It is
anguish
only to be felt, it is
impossible
to
convey the
smallest
idea of its excruciating tortures,
to any who have not experienced the agonizing effects
of divided affection.
The
English
had been driven to the very borders of
the
sea
; the Indians had
pursued
them with
unremitting
fury, ravaging the habitations, and, giving the
unoffending inmates a quick
passport
to eternal
rest
with their tomahawks, nor command nor entreaty
could
restrain
their
impetuosity
.
William had followed a party led by Yankoo, to a
house
situated
in a deep wood. As they approached,
a cry of terror
issued
from the dwelling. The heart
of William throbbed with anxiety; he quickened his
steps
, and arrived at the door
just
as Yankoo had
dragged forth by his venerable locks, a man, whom
he no
sooner
beheld than he recognized the features of
his father. The arm was
raised
that was meant to
destroy
him.
Hold,
monster
! barbarian! exclaimed William,
and throwing
himself
on the body of his father,
received
the falling weapon on his own
shoulder
. It fell
heavy, it
sunk
deep, and the blood
issued
in a torrent
from the wound.
Yankoo recoiled with horror; he beheld his ruler,
his friend, and more than
those
, the brother of Rachel,
weltering in gore, wounded even unto death, and by
his hand. He knelt upon the ground, he took his
hand. Oh! brave warrior,
said
he, why did
you throw
yourself
in my way? William
raised
himself
,
and pointing to old Mr. Dudley, cried, To
save
a father.
The old gentleman, in
some
measure
relieved from
his fright, endeavoured to
rise
from the earth; but
hearing the
expression
of father from the lips of one
whom he
supposed
an Indian chief, the truth began
to dawn upon his mind. He knelt
beside
the dying
sachem
, and taking his hand, looked
earnestly
in his
face, and cried, Is it indeed
possible
? are you my
son
?
Your own
son
William, replied the bleeding
warrior.
But alas!
said
the old man, you are, I fear,
mortally wounded.
And if I am, replied the heroic William, it is
a glorious wound; for I give my life to
preserve
the
life of him from whom I received it.
As he
finished
these
words, he fell back and his eyes
closed
. The whole party were now
assembled
round
their wounded chief; they
raised
him from the earth,
and bore him into his father's cottage, where,
confined
by infirmity, was the unfortunate patient Arrabella.
She had heard the exclamations of her
husband
; her
heart had not yet become callous to
misery
. The
beholding
her long-
lost
son
, was double agony,
since
she
but beheld his
closing
scene
. He recovered a moment
after they had laid him on the bed, gazed on the
countenance
of his mother, faintly articulated her name,
and his
last
breath
passed
in imploring a
blessing
on
her.
The news of their
sachem
's death, and by whom,
soon
reached the tribe William had governed, and
they repaired to the place of his
decease
, vowing
revenge
on his murderer; for in that light they looked
upon Yankoo. But when they
rushed
furiously
into
the
house
, intending to wreak their vengeance on him,
the mute
sorrow
depicted on his face, as with his arms
folded on his
bosom
he
stood
contemplating the
mangled
form of his departed friend, for a moment
disarmed
their rage. He
saw
them enter, and
advancing
intrepidly towards them,
Friends, Countrymen, and brother Warriors,
said
he, with a firm voice, that I have incurred your
hatred, that your rage is
justly
excited, is a truth I
pretend not to evade or deny. I have
deserved
death
at your hands, and behold, here I
stand
prepared to
meet it. Strike; I will not flinch; or lead me forth,
and let me experience the
most
cruel tortures, I will
not complain; nor
sigh
nor groan
shall
escape
my lips.
Alas! if torture could wring them from me, how
loud would my lamentations now be! The chief
whom we all loved, the man we all revered, is gone
to the land of
spirits
; is gone to that Father, that
great
First
Cause
, of whom we have
so
often heard
him
speak
. He is
passed
from us, and my hand gave
the
passport
,
signing
it with his blood.
He
paused
, and his untamed
spirit
swelled
even to
his eyes; but he repelled the tokens of his
sensibility
,
that were
almost
bursting
from the
glistening
orbits,
and
struggling
for a moment to recover the
firmness
of his voice, proceeded:
Thou art gone, brave chief! (turning as he
spoke
towards the body of his friend) thou art gone; and
where
shall
thy equal be found to
supply
thy place?
Thou wert bold and daring as the young lion, and like
him, generous and noble, exerted not thy power
against
the feeble and
defenceless
. Firm and
unshaken
in
asserting
the rights of innocence, as the mountain
whose
foundation is in the centre of the earth, and
whose
top
reacheth unto the clouds; yet gentle as the
south
-
west
breeze on an evening in the
blossom
season
, and
complying
as the willow, that inclines its head as the
breeze
passes
. Thy voice was the voice of
wisdom
.
Thy words taught
lessons
, which thy example enforced.
But thou art gone! and where
shall
thy equal be
found to
supply
thy place? Thou wert glorious as
the
sun
at his
uprising
, mild and beautiful as the beams
of the moon, when it dances on the
bosom
of the lake
which the wind gently agitates. In the
chase
, fleet
as the young
stag
, and the arrow from thy bow never
missed
its aim. Thou
didst
speak
, and none could
refuse
to believe; thou
didst
command, and none but
were eager to obey. The bad loved,
whilst
they
feared
thee; the good adored, and endeavoured to imitate
thee. Under thy
wise
government we
rested
in peace,
on matts made of ofiers; our wigwams were
improved
,
our bows better
strung
, our corn was multiplied
an hundred fold, and our
skins
dried with more care.
In peace thou wert as the dew of the evening,
refreshing
and invigorating all who lived beneath thy
influence
;
and in war terrible as the
tempest
that breaks
the tall pine, roots up the
stubborn
oak, and makes the
forest
tremble, as it
rushes
with tremendous fury through
it. Thy enemies beheld thee, and fear
shook
their
souls
; thou wert the father of thy people, Oh!
valiant
sachem
. But thou art goneby my hand gone!
and where
shall
thy equal be found to
supply
thy
place?
The numerous affecting images he had called
together
,
whilst
speaking
the eulogium of the
deceased
,
had now awakened feelings too powerful to be
repressed
.
The afflictions of his heart
burst
forth in loud
lamentations. The rage of his countrymen was
totally
subdued
. They dropped their tomahawks, and
joined him in piercing cries and groans, repeating at
intervals, Our chief, our warrior, our friend is gone,
and who can
supply
his place?
Arrabella had not lived
so
many years in the very
bosom
of America, at different times obliged to have
some
kind of
intercourse
with the natives, without
attaining
a
considerable
knowledge of their language.
She
listened
whilst
Yankoo was
speaking
, and as he
enumerated
the virtues of her
son
,
she
felt that,
amongst
the
tears of regret that fell for his death, were
some
of
exultation that he had
deserved
such
an eulogium, and
her heart was
consoled
.
But who can paint the
anguish
, the
distress
of
Rachel
,
or the
distraction
of Oberea? When they heard
the fatal tidings, they
sought
the body of their
Husband
,
Brother, Chief. But here nor tears, nor cries
declared their
sorrow
. When the
soul
is too full,
language
is of little
use
. There are no words capable of
expressing
real affliction.
Oberea led her
son
Reuben (now nearly
six
years
old) to the bed on which lay the
corse
of his father,
and pointing to the body, pronounced in a tone deeply
mournful, Behold!
My father!
said
the boy, and, terrified at his
ghastly
appearance,
clasped
his arms round his
mother
,
and hid his face in her
bosom
. She
seated
herself
on the
side
of the bed, folded her arms round her
child, and
resting
her head on his
shoulder
, appeared
the mute image of
despair
.
The feelings of Rachel would have been equally
poignant, had they not been directed to another
channel
.
She had, as
she
entered the apartment, faintly
articulated the word
brother
. Arrabella caught the
sound
, and calling her daughter by name, Rachel was
folded in a moment to her
bosom
, and in the embrace
of a new-found mother, felt a relief from her
sorrows
.
Dudley
kissed
his daughter with
tenderness
, but the
lively affection he had once experienced towards his
children was now
almost
extinct. It had indeed for a
moment revived when he heard the voice of William,
but the icy finger of death had
silenced
that voice
forever
,
and the heart of Dudley could no more vibrate
with the
exquisite
delights
springing
from paternal
love.
By the united efforts of Rachel and Arrabella,
Oberea
was at
last
aroused
from that
state
of apparent
insensibility
into which
she
had fallen. Rachel
released
her arms from the neck of her child, and drew
her gently towards her mother, who
soothed
,
caressed
,
and called her her dear daughter, the relic of her
beloved
William.
At the name of William,
she
started
. Arrabella
perceived
she
had awakened her attention, and from
her own
son
, made a quick
transition
to the
son
of
Oberea. She begged her to call forth her fortitude,
to exert the faculties of her mind, and as
she
loved
her
husband
, for his
sake
, live, to protect and
instruct
his
son
.
I am his mother,
said
she
; have I not
reason
to lament the
loss
of a
son
so
worthy? But that he
was worthy is my comfort.. Had he not a
thousand
virtues? and will you not
strive
to live, to teach his
son
to emulate his father, to be as good, as great, as
wise
as he was?
Oberea
cast
her eyes on her child, then
suddenly
covering her face with part of her garments,
she
wept
aloud. The
desired
end was now attained. Acute
sensibility
being relieved by the
effusion
, Arrabella was
silent
, and leaving nature to its
course
, waited till the
first
rude
shock
was
past
before
she
attempted, by
reasoning
,
to convince her of the inutility of grieving.
Alas! it was a
lesson
(hard as it was) which Arrabella
had long
since
learnt; but it is what the children of
sorrow
all learn. Repeated
disappointment
first
blunts the
keenness
of our feelings; corroding
sorrow
, from
overstraining
,
weakens the chords of
sensibility
, and at
length age and infirmity, creeping by chilling yet
almost
imperceptible degrees through the whole
system
,
totally relaxes every fibre,
whilst
the heart becomes
cold and impenetrable as the ice on the
highest
summit
of the Andes.
The Indians mourned with
sincerity
for their
departed
sachem
. The chiefs and elders
assembled
,
declared
that Reuben, when of a proper age,
should
fill
the
seat
of government, till when they entreated
Dudley
to take the charge of his education. In the mean
time, they prepared to inter the remains of their chief,
with every mark of
respect
and honour. But on the
very day when the
solemnity
was to be performed,
the Europeans made an unexpected
sally
on them,
routed the main body, killed many, and took the
remainder
prisoners
.
Amongst
those
who fell was
Yankoo
.
He fought, defending the
house
where lay the
body of William, and died exhorting his companions
to conquer or die.
Dudley, his wife and daughter, with Oberea and
Reuben, were conducted to an
English
settlement
,
where the former
sunk
into a
state
of debility nearly
approaching
second
childhood, and in a few months
rested
from all his
sorrows
. When this event took place,
Arrabella determined to return to England, partly
from the hope of her native air acting as a
restorative
to
her health, and partly in the
wish
of
securing
to
Reuben
the
estates
of his great-grandfather, Sir
Ferdinando
Gorges;
besides
which,
she
knew that in Europe
she
could procure him to be properly educated, which
the very imperfect
state
of literature in America, at
that early period, would not allow her to hope,
should
she
continue there. Rachel of
consequence
accompanied
her mother; and Oberea, attached to them by
every tender tie, would not be left behind. The
mother and the
son
of my William,
said
she
, I will
follow to the
furthermost
part of the earth.
It was early in the
spring
of 1680, when the widow
Arrabella Dudley, her daughter, daughter-in-law and
grandson
arrived in England, from which
she
had been
absent
about thirty-four years. Internal feuds and
discontents
had driven
herself
and
husband
at
first
from
their native land, and
these
feuds in
some
measure
still
continued.
Arrabella found it would be in vain to
solicit
for
any part of the property of Sir Ferdinando.
Himself
and family in general had been attached to the royal
party, and during the years Dudley had been
absent
from England, the
estates
had
passed
through
so
many
different hands, that it was
almost
impossible
to trace
them; or could
she
have done
so
,
she
would have found
it difficult to make Reuben be received as the heir.
His dark complexion, the nature of his father's
marriage
with Oberea, which in law would have been
termed illegal, all militated
against
success
,
should
any
suit
be commenced
against
the
present
possessors
; and
Arrabella
wisely
determined to
consider
them as
inevitably
lost
.
She
herself
inherited, from the
bequest
of an aunt,
a
small
estate
in
Lancashire
, and thither
she
retired,
where, devoting one half of its produce to the
education
of Reuben,
she
made the other half
serve
all the
Q
purposes
of life; and this
estate
was worth but three
hundred pounds per annum. Yet Arrabella was
contented
,
and enjoyed not only the
necessaries
, but the
comforts of life. Her own appearance and that of her
daughters was always neat, always
respectable
; and
their countenances ever
serene
, if not cheerful. But
their hands were
constantly
employed, and indolence
and luxury were alike
strangers
in their dwelling.
A return to her native climate, added to the
tranquillity
she
enjoyed, in a great
measure
restored
the
health of the widow Arrabella.
Rachel, true to the
first
impulse
of her heart,
refused
to marry, though her beauty and
sweetness
had
attracted many
suitors
. I may,
she
would
say
,
find men more
accomplished
, who will talk with
more eloquence, are more
polished
in their manners;
but where
shall
I find the equal to Yankoo for
sincerity
?
Rachel preferred a
state
of
single
blessedness
.
Oberea lived to
see
her
son
attain his twenty-third
year, to
see
him beloved and
respected
by all who knew
him;
she
then fell a victim to an autumnal fever. She
had lived beloved, and died
universally
lamented.
About eighteen months after the
decease
of his
mother, Reuben became acquainted with
Cassiah
Penn.
Cassiah
was tall, well
shaped
, not
so
fair as to be pale,
nor dark enough to be termed brown; it was a
beautiful
mixture of the white
rose
and carnation that
glowed
on her forehead, tinted her cheeks, and gave
animation
to her dark hazel eyes. Her face, which was
elegantly
striking
, without being regularly beautiful,
received much improvement from a few curls of bright
chesnut
hair, which
escaped
, here and there, from the
confinement of a pinched cap (for
Cassiah
was a
Quaker
.)
Reuben
saw
and loved the fair maiden. An
intimacy had taken place between their parents, and
by
conversation
it was
discovered
, that the father of
Cassiah
was a
descendant
from Beatina Gorges, the
youngest
daughter of Sir Egbert and Columbia. It
was a kind of
relationship
that
sanctified
friendship
in
the elder branches of the family, and encouraged the
affection of the younger.
Reuben wooed, and was
successful
. He threw
aside
the habit of vanity, and
assumed
the
dress
and faith of
his beloved. Their hands were joined in the face of
the church, and Arrabella, about three months after
this event which gave her much
pleasure
, went to the
mansions
of the
blest
.
Cassiah
was young. Reuben
wished
his aunt
Rachel
to
stay
in the family and manage his
household
.
It was the very thing her heart
wished
for. My
sister
,
said
she
,
smiling
, will have enough to do to
nurse
and educate her children. But, awelladay!
aunt Rachel was wrong in her predictions; for
Reuben
was married above ten years before he had the
least
prospect
of a young family.
At length his beloved
Cassiah
bid fair to make him
a father.
Universal
joy pervaded the whole family;
but, alas! how
transient
! The eagerly
wished
for,
the long expected hour at length arrived.
Cassiah
gave birth to two infants, a boy and a girl. She
heard
she
was a mother,
blessed
her children, and
recommended
them
strongly
to the protection of their
father, and the care of aunt Rachel.
Will you name them, my love?
said
her
husband
,
bending over the bed with affection.
They
shall
be called after the two beings I love
most
,
said
she
, extending a hand to her aunt and
husband
. Call them Reuben and Rachel. A
sudden
faintness
seized
her as
she
spoke
. Gently, and
without pain, her pure
spirit
passed
from its earthly to
its eternal
mansion
.
END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.Columbus to Beatina.
October, 1490.
I AM parted from you, my adored Beatina; but
painful as the parting is, I feel it is for our
suture
advantage
.
I am convinced, my beloved wife, that there are
worlds beyond the narrow bounds which our natural
philosophers
at
present
prescribe
. I have
studied
much,
my lovely friend, and am
almost
certain, that were I
supplied
with
vessels
, men,
provisions
, and every thing
necessary
, I
should
make
discoveries
that would
occasion
my name to be revered in after ages; and
those
who blamed my lovely Beatina for giving
herself
to her
Columbus,
shall
say
, You did right, Beatina;
Columbus
has an
enterprising
spirit
that will carve out a
fortune, even from a barren
waste
. For is not the
ocean a barren
waste
? and yet even from that do I
mean to carve out for my
soul
's idol an empire, where
she
shall
reign queen over all, as
she
does over my
heart.
Why, why, my
best
beloved, are you not endowed
with
strength
of frame, that your
friendship
might
increase
my fortitude in danger, and
share
the glorious
triumph of unexpected
success
? Yet why
should
I
wish
you to
lose
the
sweet
feminine
softness
which
first
won, and
still
holds captive my heart? I know not
what I
wish
, Beatina. You
so
entirely
possess
my
thoughts, that
whilst
I
search
this
vast
globe for
unknown
worlds, to lay them at your feet when found, I
would have the fame, the glory of the
discovery
all
your own. And will it not be yours? Yes!
surely
yes; for you
inspired
the thought, prompted the
search
, and are the magic charm that actuates all my
endeavours.
Tell our dear Ferdinando, that though I have by
my marriage with his mother deprived him of his
birthright as the only heir of an ancient and wealthy
marquis, I will toil to
recompense
to him the
sacrifice
his dear mother made to me. Sweet Beatina, do not
grieve at this our long
separation
; when I return, I
will return worthy of your love; I will make my
charmer
worshipped
by
those
who now hold her in
contempt. I am about to lay before the king of
Portugal a plan for making
those
discoveries
, you have
so
frequently heard me mention as more than
probable
.
If he
listens
to me, my fortune is certain; if he
treats my
proposals
as chimerical, the offspring of a
disordered
imagination, I will apply to
some
other
power.
Dearest
, have courage; the
persevering
spirit
must
in time conquer. Believe I but
exist
,
whilst
abfent
from you, and think that
existence
scarcely
worth
preserving
but for your
sake
. Heaven
bless
my
Beatina
.
C. COLUMBUS.Columbus to Beatina.
January, 1491.
I HAVE been
disappointed
, my
sweet
friend, but
be not you
disheartened
. Thanks be to Heaven, I left
you and my darling boy in a
safe
retreat, where,
though not enjoying all the advantages your rank in
life might demand, you have at
least
all the comforts
necessary
to the real pleasures of life.
But think not, my beloved, my
esteemed
friend, I
would wander forth in
search
of adventures, and leave
the wife of my choice and the offspring of her affection
to
languish
out many years, nay, perhaps their whole
lives, in
obscurity
. No! no! Columbus labours not
for his own advantage, but for the advantage of
those
so
nearly,
so
dearly connected with him. I will leave
you, my love, whenever I quit my native land, in a
state
of honour and opulence, or my
scheme
shall
be
totally abandoned.
If I fail, if in this (generally thought) romantic
plan I
lose
my life, your father will no doubt be
reconciled
to you, nor
slight
the offspring of an only
child, on account of his affinity to an unfortunate man,
who, had he been monarch of the globe, would have
laid his crown at Beatina's feet.
I leave my native land to-morrow, in order to
solicit
Ferdinand of Spain to grant me the
vessels
and
supplies
necessary
for
prosecuting
my intended voyage. I am
told the court of Spain is more enlightened than any
other court in Europe.
I had, previous to my quitting you, found means to
lay my plans before the
British
throne; but I fear they
were treated as the project of a
visionary
; for though
my brother undertook the charge, I have received no
answer
. Alas! Beatina, how hard it is to combat
any received prejudice. The
wise
and learned men
of
past
ages have held it
impossible
for mariners to find
a
passage
, or proceed, without incurring immediate
death, beyond certain boundaries which their confined
knowledge has marked out. But I will not be
withheld
from the experiment. If I
succeed
, after ages
will revere my name; if I fail, it will
sink
quietly into
oblivion; or perhaps
some
future genius,
enterprising
and
sanguine
as
myself
,
shall
drop a tear to my
memory
,
and as he laments my fate, tremble for his own.
Adieu, my friend, my lovely comforter. I am more
yours than my own.
C. COLUMBUS.Columbus to Beatina.
May, 1492.
CONGRATULATE me, my lovely friend; I am
at length
successful
! How have I counted the tedious
months that kept me from my
soul
's idol; and how
often have I feared that my
perseverance
would be of
no avail, and that I had
sacrificed
ages of real
happiness
(for hours are ages to the heart that loves as mine
does) to the
visionary
hopes of future
greatness
. But
I am
successful
. I
shall
explore
those
distant
seas
, with
which my
studies
have
so
well acquainted me, and in
some
unknown world
seek
out a kingdom of which my
Beatina
shall
be queen. Yes, you
shall
be queen; for
whatsoever
world I find, be it the
fairest
,
greatest
, or the
best
the
sun
ever
shone
on, no man
should
ever claim a
right to govern it. For it is to a woman I owe the
means of making the great attempt. I am
so
overjoyed
I cannot proceed methodically; yet I know you
languish
to learn every particular that concerns your
Columbus.
I have in former letters informed you of my hitherto
fruitless
solicitations
. Wearied by attendance on
ministers
and creatures, who hung about the king like bees
upon the
sweet
scabious
, draining it of its vital
moisture
till its very root decayed, when they returned to their
hives laden with the precious
store
,
regardless
of the
dying
state
of the flower from which they had extracted
both life and health;
disgusted
with their unmeaning
professions
, their
hypocrisy
and
stupidity
, I had nearly
relinquished
the undertaking, when I one morning
received
an order to attend the queen's private drawing
room. You may
suppose
I did not
hesitate
to obey the
summons
. The royal
Isabelle
received me with
affability
and encouraging
sweetness
;
she
condescended
to
confer with me on my intended voyage, and on the
studies
which led me to hope for
success
. She
listened
with attention to my
reasons
, and bade me attend
the levee next morning. I went. My royal
patroness
urged my
suit
to the king with all the
earnestness
of
persuasive
eloquence. He
listened
; but it was with
cold,
almost
contemptuous
silence
. Yet was
she
not
dismayed
; her fine features glowed with
enthusiasm
, as
she
expressed
a prophetic
assurance
of
success
. Her
intercessions
were
finished
with this heroic declaration:
If your
majesty
,
said
she
, conceives the plan too
wild, too eccentric to be countenanced, by ordering this
enterprising
man the
necessary
supplies
from the public
C 2
treasury
; and if your own private
purse
will not at
present
allow of
so
large a
disbursement
,
suffer
me to
raise
the money on my own
personal
jewels. I
beseech
your
majesty
do not
say
me nay. I want no ornaments
to render me
pleasing
to my
sovereign
, and will
cheerfully
part with them, to benefit his
subjects
, or add to
his territories.
Struck with the magnanimity of the
proposal
,
Ferdinand
could no longer
refuse
; he gave immediate
orders
for the equipment of a fleet, in which I am to
proceed
on my intended
discovery
; and a
sum
of money
is to be paid to me from the
treasury
, to provide every
necessary
for the voyage.
I fell at the feet of the royal
Isabelle
, and
kissed
, with
grateful
transports
, the hem of her garment. She
graciously
raised
me, and with a
smile
of heavenly
benignity
assured
me, that you, my Beatina, and our
darling
Ferdinando,
should
be taken under her immediate
protection.
Hasten
then, my
dearest
, on the receipt of
this;
hasten
to Spain, and let me introduce you to our
august
queen. I know you will partake my joy; and
if a tear does
start
at the thought of parting, I
also
know you will wipe it off
unseen
,
lest
it
should
unman
the heart of your adoring
COLUMBUS.Isabelle, queen of Spain, to Beatina, wife to
Columbus.
February, 1493.
THOU
besom
friend of the
bravest
man that ever
lived, thy queen now claims thee as her friend and
sister
.
Isabelle
is in affliction, and calls on Beatina to
comfort her. Yet how can I
ask
comfort from you,
when I have none to offer in return? I cannot
see
you,
lest
you
curse
the hand that
supplied
the means
for this ill-
starred
voyage. Our Columbus, the man
whose
name
shall
be revered while time endures, is no
more! He
sleeps
in the
vast
ocean; but his memory
shall
live forever.
Did I
say
I had no comfort to offer? Alas! my
regrets for his
loss
were
so
great, I forgot that he
triumphed
ere he died. He found the wondrous
unknown
world he
sought
; but his own words will
best
tell his
success
. The
inclosed
was brought to our
court this morning by a
sea
captain, who,
whilst
yet
far from the
Spanish
coast
,
saw
something
floating on
the waves; and feeling an awakened
curiosity
prompt
him, went a little out of his
course
to take it up. It
was a
cask
painted white. On opening it, they
found this
sad
testimony
of our fatal
loss
,
inclosed
in a cake of wax, and
surrounded
by a quantity of
cork, in order, as is imagined, to facilitate its
swimming
.
I am inadequate to the
task
of adding more;
only to
say
, when you can
see
me without
distress
to
yourself
, come to me, and let us mingle our tears
together
.
Bring Ferdinando with you; henceforth he
is my
son
. Farewel.
ISABELLE.
Inclosed
in the foregoing.Columbus to his royal Mistress.
At
sea
,
December, 1492.
Royal and revered Lady
,
THE
most
humble and grateful of your fervants
addresses
you at a moment, when he much fears he
shall
never again behold you. I am, with my little
convoy, in a
boisterous
and
almost
unknown
sea
, at a
season
of the year when
storms
prevail, and the
inclemency
of the weather renders our
safety
extremely
precarious. The clouds hang low; the
atmosphere
is
thick; the hollow murmuring
sea
, and bleak wind
that
whistles
through the rigging, portends an
approaching
storm
.
I
shall
not fulfil my duty to the
most
gracious of
sovereigns
, if I do not try
some
method to inform her,
whatever may be my fate, her
wishes
are fulfilled.
The new, the hitherto unexplored world, of which I
fondly dreamed
so
many anxious years, is at length
discovered
! I
shall
annex to this the
course
by which
I
steered
, the
soundings
as we approached the land,
and every
requisite
direction for mariners to find the
place where I have left a little colony of forty men.
Our voyage from Spain was tedious in the extreme,
and
those
who had not the
same
internal
assurances
,
which my
intense
study
had given me, of our being in
a right
course
, were
almost
tempted to mutiny, to
confine me, and, taking command of the fleet, return
to Spain; but to my
inexpressible
joy, when even my
own
spirits
began to fail, nor could I longer have
silenced
the fears of the mariners, on the morning of
the 12th of October, I
discovered
land. We made
for the
shore
, and on the 13th landed and took
possession
of a beautiful fertile
island
, in the name of your
august
consort
Ferdinand. I
kissed
the ground as I
landed, and called it St. Salvadora, in honour of my
gracious
patroness
; for her bounty relieved me when
I was in utter
despair
of ever making the attempt of
a
discovery
, and the
sight
of this
island
preserved
me
from the vengeance of a
disappointed
, terrified
set
of
seamen
, who thought I had
foolishly
dragged them
from their friends and country to
perish
on the ocean.
I found the inhabitants humane,
social
, and tractable;
and left our little colony in a
state
of greater comfort
than could have been expected. But the
impossibility
of obtaining proper
provisions
for the long voyage
before
us, and the very fragile
state
of our barques to
combat
seas
unusually
tempestuous
at this
season
,
renders
me fearful I
shall
never again
see
Spain, or kneel
at the feet of my royal
mistress
.
The
island
I have
discovered
yields plenty of gold
dust
; pearls are found in the rivers; and from what I
could
observe
, diamonds and other precious
stones
are
easily
procured. For the natives not only wear them
in their hair and about their necks, but decorate their
temples with them, intermixed with gold and
silver
.
These
temples are in general dedicated to the
Sun
,
which is their chief object of adoration. The
sacred
duties are performed by
priestesses
, who vow eternal
virginity. Their men are tall and well proportioned;
the women beautiful in the extreme.
Thus have I
slightly
touched on the many charms
to entice my
sovereign
to make this territory her own.
Oh may the wealth its mines contain, enrich her
above all her cotemporaries; may the colony
she
plants
increase
and
flourish
; there may
she
found a
new, a glorious world, that after ages
shall
at once
admire
and fear.
And now that life perhaps is near its
close
, will my
benignant queen permit her
servant
to recommend
once more to her protection, my wife and child?
Ferdinando
is now fifteen. When he attains the age of
manhood, let him
pursue
the path I have marked out,
and
finish
what his father but begun; and
should
his
searches
meet with the
success
my
spirit
prophesies
, let
the new world be called
Columbia
. It will unite the
name of Beatina with Columbus, perpetuating her
loved
name with mine.
I would have wrote to my beloved wife, but what
could I
say
? My heart bleeds for what
she
will
suffer
.
You, my gracious
mistress
, will not
forsake
her.
Comfort
her,
console
her; tell her that Beatina will be the
last
sound
that trembles on my lips. Pardon me,
sovereign
lady, my
style
grows familiar; but the grave
levels all
distinctions
, and I am now
standing
on its
brink. A few more hours, and I plunge into a
vast
eternity! If the
storm
increases
, my
vessel
cannot much
longer brave its fury; if mine cannot, what will
become
of the poor little caravels that accompany me?
Their fate is certain! Royal
Isabelle
, farewel. While
life lingers in this frail tenement, gratitude for thy
munificence can never be extinct in the heart of thy
servant
,
COLUMBUS.Columbus to his Son Ferdinando.
Cadiz Harbour,
1499.
THY father is returned, my dear
son
, returned to his
native land. But how? Not as an
enterprising
spirit
whose
plans had proved
successful
,
should
return;
but as a traitor to his king, loaded with
ignominious
chains. Oh! my brave boy, I
see
thy noble
spirit
fire at the intelligence. But beware; conceal
the workings of thy
honest
soul
. To
prosper
in this
ungrateful world, you
must
wear the
mask
of
hypocrisy
;
wear the
semblance
of humility,
honesty
,
patriotism
, till you have obtained
some
favourite point,
then throw them
aside
as
useless
, and glory in the
success
of your
stratagems
.
Pardon me, my
son
, I write from the
impulse
of a
broken heart. I know you would
scorn
such
advice if
seriously
given, even from a father; but I have
suffered
so
much from ingratitude and duplicity, and have
seen
those
who
practise
them
most
,
seem
to
succeed
the
best
, that I would willingly
shut
my eyes on the light
of day, and
sink
into eternal
rest
. My dear
Ferdinando
,
your father has received a wound no time can heal.
Surely we
must
hope, that in the
blest
abodes of
immortality
,
the
soul
retains no remembrance of what
passed
in this
sublunary
state
;
else
certain I am, that the
delights
of
paradise
itself
would be alloyed by the
retrospect
of the ignominy I have endured, and the chains I
have worn.
And what will that
treasure
of my
soul
, thy adored
mother,
say
? How will my Beatina bear the
degradation
of her Columbus? Will not her father, (but lately
reconciled to his child) again
spurn
her from him?
And will not her haughty brothers and
sisters
pour
their
insolent
reproaches on the wife of a
disgraced
, a
ruined favourite? Your lovely Orrabella too! Alas!
I greatly fear,
whilst
we were
hospitably
entertained at
her father's court, we were ungratefully paving the
way for the introduction of war, rapine and
destruction
.
Yet
witness
, ye immortal Powers, I am
innocent
.
I
sought
not new worlds for
conquest
, or for
power; I felt, forcibly felt, the
blessings
of
Christianity
,
the comforts
resulting
from a commercial
intercourse
with other nations. I vainly thought
those
blessings
through my means might be extended, and
earnestly
wished
them participated by the whole world.
But I am venting the
sorrows
of my agonize
soul
,
and forget you are a
stranger
to what has
caused
them. Oh! ever, ever, may you remain a
stranger
to
such
anguish
. May my
son
never experience how
far beyond all other
miseries
which malice can inflict,
or human nature
suffer
, is the torture
occasioned
by
the
poisoned
sting
of ingratitude. But to my
sad
tale.
Light
pleasant
gales, and a
smooth
sea
quickly bore
the caravel in which I embarked to
Hispaniola
. A
certain emblem of the
vicissitudes
of human life; for
how often does the
sun
of
prosperity
gild the horizon,
and its delightful airs play around and
fascinate
the
senses
,
whilst
the
storms
of
adversity
hang
unobserved
,
ready to
burst
on our devoted heads.
Roldan (whom you
must
remember was appointed
through my
intercession
to the government of this
coloony
)
received me with the
gratest
marks of
respect
,
and a
profusion
of compliments. I ought to have
been upon my guard and
suspected
his
excessive
adulation
.
His
professions
of gratitude and attachment
pained me; but as I knew the
present
affluent
state
of
himself
and family originated from my
friendship
, I
attributed all to the
noblest
motives, nor once
suspected
,
that as I held him to my
bosom
I was enfolding a
serpent
that waited but an opportunity to
sting
me to the
heart.
The morning after my arrival the natives thronged
in crowds to
see
me, and in the
most
tumultuous
manner
expressed
their joy at my return. Roldan, with an
insidious
smile
, warned me to beware of giving them
too much encouragement. They are,
said
he, an
encroaching
set
of wretches, and will torment you
with complaints, which, as they
exist
only in their
own imaginations, it is not in your power to
redress
.
You had better
speak
to them a little
sternly
, and
dismiss
them to their homes.
How?
said
I, rather
surprised
, I do not rightly
understand
you. What privilege can
these
people
solicit
from you or me, which they have not a right to
demand? Is not this continent theirs by right of
nature
?
and is not the privilege of living here
unmolested
enjoyed by us through their
unsuspecting
good
nature
,
and the confidence they place in our
honest
intentions
?
and
shall
we
abuse
this confidence, repay
their
hospitality
by infringing their natural rights?
Heaven forbid! If they have complaints to make, it
is our duty to hear, and to the
utmost
of our power
redress
them.
As I
spoke
with fervor, I
observed
the countenance
of Roldan change. A livid
paleness
overspread
his
face; his eyes gleamed, his lips trembled, and every
features
expressed
a rage which he in vain attempted to
conceal by a haggard
smile
.
All is not as it
should
be,
said
I mentally; I
will inquire into the nature of the complaints he
seems
so
anxious to evade. If Roldan has made an
unjust
use
of his power, it is not our
past
friendship
shall
screen
him from my reproach, or lead me to
continue
him in a
station
he appears inadequate to fill.
Full of
these
thoughts, I immediately
set
an inquiry
on foot concerning the general conduct of Roldan and
his officers. I found they had
grossly
abused
the
power
intrusted
to them; that they had
distressed
and
treated the natives in many
cases
with the
utmost
barbarity
!
and that this arbitrary governor had
supported
the Spaniards in every act of
injustice
or enormity they
chose
to commit.
Having traced
these
grievances to their
source
, I
requested
a council might be called; and then, in the
most
forcible language I could think of, yet with
temper
and
mildness
, I
represented
to them all the iniquity
of their proceedings, conjured them to
redress
the
injuries
they had committed, and to reform the
government
.
Some few
seemed
pleased
with my
remonstrance
,
but the greater part heard me in
sullen
silence
.
Roldan thanked me with a
sarcastic
smile
for my
advice; but at the
same
time told me he held his
office
by a
commission
from the royal Ferdinand, and
to him only was accountable for his actions. I was
thunderstruck
by his
speech
and manner, and left the
council room in a perturbation of mind not
easily
described
.
Amongst
the officers under the command of
Roldan
in this
settlement
, was a young man of
dissolute
D 2
manners, named Diego. He was younger
son
son
to
a noble family; but having
dissipated
a
considerable
fortune, and from being at
first
only weak and
foolish
,
having become vicious, his friends thought proper to
solicit
employment for him in the new
settlement
, and
he was accordingly appointed third in command.
This man I found the
bosom
confidant and privy
counsellor
of Roldan. His rapacity knew no bounds;
his
passions
were his only
master
; and hurried by
them to dreadful
excesses
, he committed crimes at
which humanity at once
blushed
and trembled.
Though the very little knowledge I had of Diego had
by no means prejudiced me in his favour, I could not
have
supposed
he would have perpetrated crimes of
the
blackest
die without compunction, or that Roldan
would have openly dared to
sanction
his
licentiousness
;
but I was at length fatally convinced, that when vice
and folly are leagued together, there is no
wickedness
,
however horrible, at which they will
hesitate
.
Bruna was the only child of a venerable Indian,
whose
possessions
were
extensive
and valuable. I had
cultivated a
friendship
with the father of Bruna, when
first
the
settlement
was formed; and both
myself
and
followers experienced from him the
kindness
and
attention
which nature, when unadulterated by art, is ever
ready to offer to the
friendless
, or the
stranger
. His
dwelling was at our
service
; he
supplied
us plentifully
with goat's milk, the
flesh
of deer, dried maize, and
other comforts of life, which, to men who had
experienced
a tedious and
wearisome
voyage, were real
luxuries.
Bruna at this time was a lovely child of about
twelve years old;
she
was wild and untutored; but
there was
something
so
engaging in her manner,
so
fascinating
in her vivacity, that I could not
see
her
daily without becoming
insensibly
attached to her.
Her
curiosity
was unbounded; and the
surest
way to
become a favorite with her, was by gratifying a
propensity
which in general was directed to laudable
objects
.
I was charmed with her
artless
thirst
for
knowledge
,
and employed my
leisure
moments in
instructing
her. But thought eager to learn, that very
eagerness
counteracted her
wishes
. She was too
hasty
and
impetuous
to allow
herself
sufficient
time to become a
proficient in any thing; therefore all my attention
could do, was to give her a trifling knowledge of the
Spanish
language. For when I
spoke
to her of the
customs
and manners of the European world,
she
would laugh, and declare her own country manners
were
best
; for
she
could not
possibly
think any duty
obliged us to conceal our thoughts, or that any
custom
whatever could make it laudable to
speak
one
thing and think another. I give you this
slight
sketch
of her character, that you might not be
surprised
at
what I have to relate concerning this Indian heroine.
It was about ten days after my arrival, as I was
walking a few miles from the plantation, and
remarking
the improvement agriculture had made on the face
of this beautiful fertile continent, when in a low-built
hovel I
saw
an ancient Indian
seated
on the ground;
his elbows
rested
on his knees, his hands
clasped
his
forehead, as his head reclined upon them. I
stopped
for a moment to contemplate a figure
so
striking
; and
as I
paused
, the
sighs
that broke from his agitated
bosom
, went to my very heart. The
noise
I
undesignedly
made as I moved neaxer the hovel,
occasioned
him to
raise
his head. I was amazed; it was the
father of Bruna! He gazed for a moment eagerly upon
me; then
springing
forward, fell on his knees,
kissed
my hands, my
seet
, the very hem of my garments.
In vain I attempted to
raise
him; he
prostrated
himself
on the earth, and laid my hand upon his head, in
token of owning me for his
master
.
Pray
rise
, my worthy friend,
said
I, and tell me
what is the meaning of this humiliation? who has
caused
the change I perceive to have taken place in
your
circumstances
?
Christians
!
Christians
! replied he with
vehemence
,
gnashing
his teeth as he
spoke
, they have
plundered me of my wealth, torn my child from my
arms; but you are come, and I
shall
be revenged.
The confidence this poor Indian
seemed
to have in my
integrity, filled my eyes with tears.
Yes,
said
I, tell me who has treated you thus
barbarously
; and if I have the power, you
shall
have
ample
restitution
. Alas! cried the old man, of
what avail will be the
restitution
of my wealth,
unless
you can
restore
my child, my darling to my arms
pure and
unspotted
?
He then informed me that
soon
after the arrival of
Roldan at the
settlement
, an entire change took place
in the government; vice was tolerated, private
property
not in the
least
regarded, but every thing
subjected
to the
lawless
power of the new governor and his
favourite.
Diego
saw
Bruna; her beauty kindled in his
bosom
an unholy flame; he
solicited
her love and was rejected.
He dared attempt her
chastity
, and was
repulsed
with
scorn
. That moment
sealed
the ruin of her father.
Diego complained to Roldan, that the father of Bruna
refused
to
submit
to the
Spanish
laws, and had even
treated him with contempt and
derision
, who had
endeavoured
to enforce them. Roldan, glad of an
opportunity
to gratify his ruling
passion
, which was avarice,
gave ear to the complaint of his favourite; and
driving
the unoffending Indian from a home he had
inherited
from his
ancestors
,
seized
on all his valuable
property,
ostensibly
in the name of the
Spanish
King,
but in reality to enrich his own private coffers.
Bruna, unknowing to what danger
she
exposed
herself
,
and thinking this piece of
injustice
was entirely the
act of Diego, flew to the governor for
redress
. Her tears,
her innocent
supplications
, had no effect on the
obdurate
heart of Roldan! he inhumanly rejected her
suit
,
detained her
person
, and gave her into the power of
Diego. This horrid
scene
was acted but the day
before
my arrival.
You
shall
have
justice
, old man,
said
I; come
with me. He followed me to the
house
of the
governor
.
At
sight
of him, Roldan
started
and turned pale;
but
soon
recovering
himself
, he
asked
him, in a
stern
voice, what he did there. He comes for
justice
,
said
I, he comes to demand
restitution
of his
property
,
of which he has been robbed, and his daughter,
who is
unjustly
detained from him. The artful
wretch has
imposed
on you,
said
Roldan fiercely,
but go,
slave
, turning to the Indian, get from my
sight
, and be thankful your
insolence
does not
cost
you
your life. I was preparing to reply in a proper
manner to this inhuman tyrant, when Bruna
rushed
into the apartment, her hair
dishevelled
her garments
disordered
, and her eyes wild with terror. She threw
herself
into her father's arms, and gave way to a
violent
gush
of tears; but the
tenderness
that
seemed
to
overcome her was but momentary. She recovered
herself
, and
raising
her head, looked round with a
kind of
sullen
dignity. Her eyes met mine.
Perceiving
she
knew me, I offered her my hand, and was
proceeding to comfort her; but with a rejecting
motion
,
she
put back my
prossered
hand, and covering
her face with both her own, turned from me. I
instantly
comprehended the extent of the injury
she
had
sustained
, and my
soul
shuddered
within me.
Roldan's agitation was too great to
escape
notice;
he attempted twice to
speak
, but words were denied
him. His pale countenance betrayed his guilty heart.
At length he
hesitatingly
told Bruna, if that was
her father, and
she
had forcibly been detained from
him,
she
was now at liberty to return home. The
poor girl
stood
for a moment the image of mute
despair
;
then
raising
her hands and eyes to heaven, cried,
Home! No! never! Bruna is the daughter of the
chaste
Lilah, and was
instructed
by the
wise
precepts
of her father, to prize her honour above her life. Their
mansion
was the dwelling of innocence, piety, and
virtue
;
and never will their wretched daughter carry
pollution
thither. Then turning toward her father,
she
made as though
she
would have embraced him; but
with a kind of involuntary
shudder
,
shrunk
again from
him, and drawing a dagger
she
had concealed in her
bosom
, plunged it in her heart.
This
sudden
, unexpected event threw the governor
and all his attendants into the
utmost
confusion
.
The
servants
, terrified, opened the doors; and a
concourse
of people, Spaniards as well as natives,
rushed
in. The bleeding form of the lovely Bruna, the
agonizing
sorrow
of her father, acted like a
talisman
on the minds of the people; and in a few hours the
whole
settlement
was in a
state
of
insurrection
.
Justice
!
justice
! was the cry: Deliver up Diego to our
power, or we will extirpate the race of
Christians
from
amongst
us. Roldan in this exigence applied to me
to quiet the enraged multitude. I
spoke
to them; I
promised
they
should
have ample
justice
! I
soothed
them
by
speaking
of the virtues of Bruna, and execrating
the author of her ruin, and
consequent
death; and at
length
persuaded
them to depart quietly to their homes;
assuring
them that Diego was in confinement, and
should
be made to
suffer
, to the extent of the law, the
punishment
due to his crimes.
After a day of
such
unusual
agitation, I retired to
my apartment. Fatigued in body, and
distressed
in
mind,
sleep
was a
stranger
to my eyes, and I was
ruminating
on the
best
means to
appease
the irritated natives,
when a band of Roldan's guards entered my
chamber
,
and
arrested
me as a traitor to my king,
accused
me of being
disaffected
to his government, and
inflaming
the minds of his
subjects
in
Hispaniola
to
rebellion
.
Resistance
or
remonstrance
was vain; they were
the tools of arbitrary power, and I
submitted
in
silence
.
They manacled my hands and feet, and putting a
gag in my mouth, conveyed me on board a
vessel
lying
in the harbour. Yes, Ferdinando, your father
was chained, and
sent
to his native country as a traitor.
As
soon
as I was on board, and the guard departed,
I found, by the motion of the
vessel
, we were under
way; the wind was fair, and
she
left the
shores
of
Hispaniola
with rapidity.
About two hours after daylight, the captain entered
the cabin where I was, and entreated my pardon for
having been obliged to act contrary to his inclinations.
I am but a
servant
,
said
he, and
must
obey
those
whom the king has
set
over me. I am ordered to
keep you a
close
prisoner
till our arrival in Spain;
but here I
shall
dare to
transgress
my orders
so
far as
to
release
you from your chains. He then advanced
to take off the
insulting
badges of my
disgrace
, but I
forbid him. No, Don Sancho,
said
I, if I am
guilty, I will
suffer
the
sentence
my
sovereign
may
think proper to
pass
on me with
resignation
. If I
have been
unjustly
accused
, to him do I look for
redress
;
into his
presence
will I go, loaded with
these
ignominious bonds, and when my innocence is proved,
from his hands only will I accept of liberty.
Hasten
then, my dear
son
, on the immediate receipt
of this, to my royal
mistress
and
patroness
; deliver
to her own hand the
inclosed
few lines; and
should
she
condescend
to
request
it, lay the contents of this
letter before her. Comfort and
console
your angel
mother ere you leave her. Embrace your charming
wife for me.
Whilst
I live, you
share
my heart
amongst
you. The
strong
sense
I have of my
present
injuries,
is only for your
sakes
? for of what
consequence
would
the
smiles
or frowns of princes be to me, were not my
wife and children to be involved in my
disgrace
, or
exalted
by my
success
and honour.
Hasten
, my
son
,
after
you have fulfilled this
commission
, to the arms of
your father; come, my brave boy, and by a filial tear
heal the
anguish
, which at
present
corrodes the heart of
COLUMBUS.Ferdinando to his Mother.
HAD I a conveyance,
swift
as my own impatience,
to forward to my revered mother the joyful tidings of
my father's triumph over his enemies, the wings of
the wind would be too tardy to bear this to your hands.
Yes, my dear mother, Columbus, the great, the
enterprizing
Columbus, is
restored
to all his former dignity,
and even
fresh
honours are heaped upon him. But I
know you
wish
me to be particular; and how can I
be more
pleasingly
employed than in recounting the
noble conduct of a father, and obeying the commands
of the
best
of mothers?
When in obedience to my father's mandate I
repaired
to court, and
requested
an audience with the
royal
Issabelle
, I was, within a few hours after the
Iabelle">Issabelle
, I was, within a few hours after the
re-request
was made, admitted. An
unusual
gloom,
almost
approaching to
severity
, was
cast
over a
countenance
,
which heretofore had only on me beamed
smiles
of benevolence. It chilled me to the heart. I
approached
with extreme agitation; and, bending one knee
to the ground,
presented
the
sealed
paper which was
inclosed
in my father's letter. The queen
paused
for a
moment,
seemingly
irresolute
whether or not to break
the
seal
. My agitation
increased
, my knees trembled,
my heart beat violently. My
disorder
did not
pass
unnoticed. Calm your fears, Ferdinando,
said
Issabelle
,
as
she
at length opened the letter; your
father
has, it is true, powerful enemies; but if his
innocence
is apparent, he will ever find in me a
steady
,
powerful friend. I bowed in grateful
acknowledgement
of her
goodness
, and
she
in
silence
perused
the
letter. A
crimson
glow
overspread
her face as
she
read;
it
seemed
the glow of
resentment
, as folding the paper
she
unlocked a
small
cabinet, and
deposited
it
amongst
some
other writings.
You have a letter from Columbus,
said
she
,
permit me to
see
it. I
presented
it. Go,
said
she
, taking it from me, retire in peace; the
success
of
my hero has awakened the envy of
those
who had not
courage to follow his example, he has been traduced
to the king; but
Isabelle
will not
suffer
a man,
whose
merit
she
esteems
and
whose
cause
she
espouses
, to be
injured with impunity.
Charmed by
these
condescending
expressions
, I
bowed
and retired. In about two hours, I received a
mandate
signed
by the queen's hand, ordering me to repair
immediately to the port, and conduct my injured
father
to her
presence
. Take off his chains, were the
words, and let him come to his
sovereign
, attended
with all the
respect
and honour a man
deserves
, who,
whilst
he was adding new territories to our crown,
whilst
he had it in his power to heap up mines of wealth
for his own coffers, forgot not the
cause
of humanity,
and rather than countenance one act of tyranny,
hazarded
the
displeasure
of his king, the
loss
of his fortune,
nay even life
itself
. But his
sovereign
shall
reward him.
Her
majesty
's own
servants
and mules attended my
commands; and quick as it was
possible
, I
pursued
my
journey, and flew to the arms of my father. Our
meeting was beyond
description
. The agitation of his
mind had affected his health; his countenance was pale
and dejected; his
person
neglected. I offered to take off
his fetters,
shewed
him the queen's mandate, but in
vain. I will go to my royal
mistress
,
said
he, but
I will go as I am. When he
saw
the
servants
that
attended
to conduct himPoor pageantry,
said
he,
pitiful
recompense
for the injuries I have received!
No! no! I will have no attendants. I am a
disgraced
man, and will enter the metropolis with as little
noise
as
possible
;
obscurity
and
silence
suits
best
with
dishonour
.
But mark me, my
son
, as my
disgrace
has
been public,
so
shall
be my
justification
. There was
such
majesty
in his manner,
such
fixed
resolution
in his
looks, I dared not
oppose
him. I
dismissed
the retinue
that attended; and with only my own
servant
,
accompanied
my father, by the
most
unfrequented roads, to
the court of Ferdinand and
Isabelle
.
It was about twelve o'clock when we arrived, and
orders were given for our immediate
admission
. Never
shall
I forget the countenance of the royal
Isabelle
,
when
she
beheld her hero enter thus encumbered with
the
testimonies
of his
disgrace
. The king and queen were
seated
at the upper end of the
presence
chamber,
attended
by many noblemen and cavaliers, tried friends
of my father, and
some
whom I knew to be his
enemies
.
Columbus entered the door a few
steps
, then
E
making a full
stop
, bent his knee to the ground, and
raising
his manacled hands, attempted to
speak
; but
pride,
resentment
, wounded honour,
swelled
his brave
heart nearly to
bursting
; and,
spite
of his endeavours
to
suppress
them, the
scalding
tears rolled down his
pale face. It was a reproach more poignant than
words could have conveyed.
Isabelle
rose
from her
seat
, her own eyes
glistening
with the dew of
sensibility
; and advancing to my
father,
raised
him.
Rise
, my brave admiral,
said
she
, and let thy queen take off
these
fetters, of which
she
has more
cause
to be
ashamed
than you have.
Then leading him to the king, Royal Sir,
said
she
,
how
shall
we
recompense
this worthy man for the
undeserved
humiliation he has received?
Columbus
,
said
Ferdinand, I
blush
for the indignities
offered
you in the
person
of my
representative
; but
you
shall
have ample revenge. Go to your wife and
friends, indulge awhile in
case
, and recruit your
strength
and
spirits
; in the mean time, I will give
orders
for the preparation of a fleet
superior
to any you
have yet commanded; in it you
shall
return to our new
colonies, of the whole of which I from this moment create
you viceroy, giving you unlimited power to create or
displace
officers, and
distribute
rewards and
punishments
at
pleasure
. I know it is a power you will not
abuse
. Go, valiant chief, and reign over a people,
whom you have conquered by
practising
humanity,
not the arts of war. But take
those
fetters from my
sight
, continued he; that Columbus ever wore
them, will
cast
a
lasting
shade
on my memory; and
ages yet unborn, when they
shall
hear the tale
related
,
will
accuse
Ferdinand of ingratitude.
Pardon me, gracious
sire
,
said
my father,
placing
his foot on the chains as one of the guards
attempted
to remove them;
these
fetters are mine. I
purchased
them with fatigue and danger, went through
many perils by
sea
and land to obtain them, nor will I
lightly part with them. Wherever I go, they
shall
go with me; I will contemplate them every day,
lest
prosperity
should
make me forget, on what a frail
tenure
I hold my
happiness
. I will look at them; and
whilst
I recollect the
anguish
I felt when they were
imposed
on me, learn to be cautious how I attempt to
inflict
the
same
misery
on a fellow creature. When I
am unhappy, I will cheer my heart by the
remembrance
,
that the moment when my royal
mistress
took
these
fetters off my hands, was the
most
transporting
moment
of my life; for it
reinstated
me in the good
opinion
of my
sovereign
, gave my friends
cause
for
exultation
,
and covered my enemies with
consusion
.
Ferdinand was
silent
.
Isabelle
smiled
; it was a
smile
of triumph. You
must
do as you
please
,
said
she
. Then turning to the guard, convey them to
wherever Columbus orders; his intrepid
spirit
can
convert even fetters into badges of
distinction
.
Their
majesties
then left the chamber followed by
the court, and in a moment I was locked in the arms
of my father, and mingled with him
some
of the
most
delicious tears I ever
shed
. Tell my lovely Orrabella,
in a few hours after
she
receives this, I
shall
be at her
feet. Yes, my revered mother, I
shall
behold once
more all the
dearest
objects of my affections united in
one family circle. I
shall
see
your dear countenance
beam with heartfelt
satisfaction
;
see
my father happy
in the
bosom
of his family; and in the
smiles
of my
Orrabella and her
sweet
infant, enjoy every felicity of
which human nature is capable. Farewel till we
meet.
FERDINANDO.Beatina to Isabelle.
Valladolid,
1520.
AS the
perusal
of the
inclosed
letters and papers
will no doubt awaken in the
bosom
of my dear
Isabelle
,
a
curiosity
to learn the events that followed this
triumph
of Columbus over his enemies; and as I think
it
necessary
to inform her, not only of her
descent
from
the native kings of Peru, but
also
of the
sate
of her
parents, who now, alas! are no more, I have taken
up my pen to trace every
circumstance
that may tend
to prove your right to the
sovereignty
of Quito, and
the
surrounding
territories, if hereafter you
should
think
it worth contending for. But as I leave you, my dear
child, in the protection of my own family; and am
fully
sensible
that my nephew, the marquis Guidova, will
take
such
care of your fortune, (now ample) that by
the time you are of age to
peruse
these
papers, you
will be one of the
richest
heiresses
in Spain; I fondly
hope you will not
suffer
the vain ambition of bearing
the empty title of queen to influence your conduct, or
tempt you to throw away the real
blessings
of life in
pursuit
of
shadows
and toys.
I am old, my dear
Isabelle
, and have lived to bury
all my
dearest
affections in the
silent
grave, except the
kindly lambent flame that warms my languid heart
when I behold your innocent
smiles
, and
listen
to your
lively prattle. You are now
scarcely
five years old;
I cannot therefore expect to live to
see
you enter on the
busy
stage
of life. Let me entreat you then (and think,
as you
peruse
this, your grandmother
speaks
to you
from the grave) let me entreat you to pay the
strictest
attention to the advice of your uncle and his amiable
wife. Certain I am, they will never
impose
harsh
commands
;
and to them I leave the full power of
controlling
and directing you during the dangerous period of
youth.
One thing I think it proper you
should
know, in the
choice of a partner for life, (though I would
wish
you
to
consult
those
dear friends,) you are entirely your
own
mistress
. At the age of 21, your fortune will be
put in your own power; but,
Isabelle
, remember the
royal race from whence you
sprang
, and do not
disgrace
it by an ignoble alliance. It is not wealth, it is not
titles
,
I would have you
seek
! no, my child;
seek
courage
,
honour, good
sense
, and
polished
manners.
These
constitute
true nobility; it was
these
so
eminently
distinguished
the great Columbus; made him the
delight
of our
sex
, the envy of his own.
I
say
you are your own
mistress
; in every point but
one you are
so
. I charge you,
Isabelle
, as you value
your eternal peace, unite not your fate with that of a
heretic. Should you unhappily feel a growing
inclination
for one of
those
impious innovators on the rights
and ceremonies of our holy mother church, repel it
with your
utmost
power; for in that
case
your
guardian
has my authority peremptorily to
refuse
his
sanction
to your union. And
should
you form
such
a
connexion
in defiance of his
absolute
commands, your
fortune, on the
instant
of your marriage, becomes
forfeit
,
and will go to the marquis's
eldest
son
. My
wishes
to
see
you not only temporally but eternally
happy, have led me to make this point
indisputable
;
but I
trust
it is a
needless
caution,
since
you will be
brought up in the true religion, in the religion of your
ancestors
; and will feel a
just
abhorrence for
those
licentious wretches, who arrogantly
style
themselves
reformers. Of all the European courts, none are
so
infested
with this
sect
as the
English
. Beware, then;
and when you behold a gay,
accomplished
Englishman
,
and many
such
visit
the court of Spain, before
you venture too nearly to contemplate his
seeming
virtues and graces,
say
within
yourself
, May not this
man be tinctured with the principles I am cautioned
to avoid? Think thus, avoid him, and be happy.Reuben and Rachel;
OR,
Tales of Old Times.
VOLUME SECOND.

Q 2
CHAP. I.
Tales by
Comparison
modern, by the
same
Rule ancient;
or, Tales of Old Times continued.
To
lose
the partner of the heart, and not feel
acutely, would be
justly
termed
stupidity
. To
attempt to delineate
those
feelings, might with equal
justice
be called
presumption
. The
first
year of our
hero and heroine's
existence
must
therefore be
passed
over in
silence
. At the end of that period we behold
their father combating, by the efforts of
reason
and
constant
employment, the barbed
shafts
of affliction.
The very attempt to repel them weakened their force;
by repeated
resistance
they became entirely
harmless
,
and fell, totally bereaved of point or power, to the
ground.
Reuben Dudley regained his
serenity
; his affections,
his hopes, his
fondest
wishes
were now centred in his
children. Regret for the mother was
swallowed
up
in expectation of the children's future virtues and
happiness
.
Aunt Rachel
presided
over the
household
,
and
superintended
the
nursery
.
Reuben and Rachel were by no means
superior
to
the generality of children of their age and condition.
Rachel was a lively brown girl, and both
she
and her
brother very
soon
discovered
, that by crying
vociferously
they could obtain
almost
any thing. Aunt
Rachel would not
suffer
the dear creatures to be
crossed
,
and papa thought them, without exception, the
sweetest
,
most
charming children in the
universe
. Alas!
cries affected
wisdom
, how
foolish
the
supposition
;
but
reason
,
unbiassed
by prejudice, declares it is only
nature, pure,
undisguised
nature.
Nature! dear
goddess
! how beautiful thou art,
when,
chaste
and unadorned, thou
appearest
in the
vestments
of
simplicity
; when the undeviating
features
portray but the feelings of the heart; when the
tongue, uncontaminated by vice,
unversed
in the
practice
of deception, gives utterance only to what
those
feelings dictate; then, who can
resist
thy eloquence?
then, who can
listen
to thy voice, or behold thy
beauties
unmoved? The
philosopher
gazes at thee with
rapture; the
stoic
cannot
investigate
thy charms and
retain his apathy; forgetting his affected
insensibility
,
he beholds with wonder, admiration and love, thy in
obstrusive
excellence, and joins involuntarily in the
exclamation
of the
enthusiast
, Oh Nature! dear
goddess
!
how beautiful throu art.
The children were neither
strikingly
beautiful, or
remarkably brilliant. Health,
cheerfulness
, and
dispositions
naturally good, rendered them engaging;
but their minds, like the minds of
most
infants, were
perfect blanks, on which the hand of education might
impress
whatever characters the
instructor
pleased
.
As they were educated in the
strictest
principles of
Quakerism
, neither trouble nor
expense
was
bestowed
on the ornamental parts, though every thing
useful
was attended to with the
utmost
care.
As they advanced in years, their characters
naturally
developed
themselves
. Reuben was open,
generous
,
unsuspecting
, and
possessed
a
firmness
of temper,
almost
approaching to
obstinacy
.
Enthusiastic
in his
attachment to his
sister
, from
earliest
infancy his
actions
had declared, that to
see
her contented and
happy
,
made him
so
.
Rachel was
modest
,
unassuming
, meek, timid and
affectionate.
Possessed
of a good
understanding
, a
quick and clear perception, and a
strong
memory, the
task
of
instructing
her was
most
delightful. Daily,
nay,
almost
hourly did her mind unfold
some
new,
some
unexpected beauty. Her love of literature, and
the rapid
progress
she
made in every
study
in which
she
engaged, at once charmed and
astonished
her aunt
and father. But her extreme diffidence prevented her
excellencies from being
universally
known, and it was
only by a long and intimate acquaintance her
intrinsic
worth could be
discovered
. Yet Rachel was not
faultless
. The
meekness
of her temper was
such
, that
resentment
was a
stranger
to her
bosom
. An injury
was no more remembered than as it had given pain to
her heart, and that heart, moulded by the hand of
pure innocence, was credulous in the extreme. Her
excessive
anxiety to
see
others happy, made her
inattentive
to the means of promoting or
preserving
her
own
happiness
; and if any one
professed
to love her,
though but a moment before they had held a dagger
to her
breast
,
she
would have forgot the intended
injury
,
and never doubting their
sincerity
, admitted them
to her confidence and
friendship
. Her affection for her
brother was equal to his for her. To
separate
them,
though but for an hour, was to give them the
severest
uneasiness
. They were parted with tears, and met
again with
superlative
satisfaction
.
Such were Reuben and Rachel at ten years of age.
Their father doted on them with the
tenderest
affection
,
and aunt Rachel thought they were the
most
superior
beings in the whole
universe
. She would
sometimes
talk to them about America,
describe
the
vast
woods,
boundless
plains,
majestic
rivers, and
extensive
lakes of that great continent. Reuben would
listen
with rapture, and
say
, When I am a man, aunt, I
will go there. I
should
like to go too, Rachel
would
say
, but I am
sure
I
should
be afraid to go to
sea
.
It was on a winter's evening, as their father was
overlooking
some
papers, old deeds, &c. that had lain
mouldy in an old trunk for many years, (intending to
destroy
those
that were
useless
) that Reuben
espied
a
fearlet plume, or rather coronet of feathers, which had
been thrown with
some
other
rubbish
in a heap, in
order
to be burned. He
seized
it, examined it with
attention
,
and at length, conceiving the
purpose
for
which it had been made, tied it round his head, and
marching up to his father, cried, Look at me, Sir.
Upon my word, Sir, replied his father,
smiling
,
why you look like a
sachem
indeed now.
Why, father, did the
sachems
of the Indians wear
such
things on their heads?
asked
Reuben.
Yes, replied his father, that was your
grandfather's
coronet.
My grandfather, Sir!
Yes, child; he became a
sachem
by marrying the
daughter of an Indian chief; but I thought your aunt
had told you that long ago.
No indeed, Sir; will you tell us all about it, how
it came to happen, now?
No; it is a long
story
, and I am
busy
.
Curiosity
is perhaps the
strongest
impulse
of the
human
mind. In extreme youth its power is
irresistible
.
The children felt theirs awakened, and
softly
opening
the door of their father's
study
, they
slipped
out, and
ran into the parlour to aunt Rachel. Aunt Rachel
was, it is true, an old maid.
Full fifty winters, as they
pass
'd, had
shed
Their
silver
honours on her rev'rend head;
But
still
her heart its
pristine
warmth retain'd;
The days were
past
, but mem'ry
still
remain'd.
Still the lov'd form of the lamented youth,
His faith, his love, his
constancy
, his truth,
Were
treasur
'd there.
The coronet that bound the brows of Reuben,
recalled
a
thousand
tender recollections. Her dear
brother
William
seemed
to
stand
in miniature before her.
The form of Yankoo
arose
to her remembrance.
Oberea
too
seemed
present
; and when the boy
asked
her if
she
knew
whose
crown that was, her feelings were
so
powerful
as for a moment to
suspend
her
answer
.
It was my brother's,
said
she
in a mournful tone,
taking it from the child's head and laying it on her
own knee; I have
seen
him wear it often.
He was a great man in America, aunt,
said
Reuben.
He was more than great, my love, he was good.
Pray, aunt,
said
Rachel, do you remember my
grandmother?
Perfectly.
Was
she
an Indian?
Yes.
What, quite a wild
savage
?
No, my dear,
she
was what is in general
erroneously
termed
so
; but her heart was as gentle, as
compassionate
,
as full of virtue and piety, as that of the
most
enlightened
Christian
.
Was
she
black, aunt?
No; dark brown, or rather copper. But the
complexion of her face was like that of her mind.
Its charms and imperfections were
discoverable
at one
glance, and it was ever beautiful,
because
invariable.
But was my grandfather a
sachem
?
He was.
What is a
sachem
?
It is a title given to a chief
amongst
the Indians,
and is the
same
as governor with us.
How came he to be a chief of the
savages
, aunt?
I will tell you, replied aunt Rachel.
It was a
subject
on which
she
delighted to expatiate.
She
stirred
up the fire, folded up her work, and placing
the attentive children on each
side
of her, began.
But my readers already know the whole
story
, and
repetitions are ever tedious and
uninteresting
. Aunt
Rachel was minute in her recital. At the account of
her capture, Rachel wept; but Reuben
started
from
his
seat
, his countenance glowing with
resentment
,
and cried, I
wish
I had been there.
And what could you have done, my love?
said
his aunt.
Have
rescued
you, or died, replied our hero.
Charming, undaunted
spirit
, exclaimed his aunt,
and then continued her narrative.
When
she
recounted the death of Otooganoo, and
the
solemn
manner in which he recommended their
father (then an infant) to the care of the chiefs, Good
old man,
said
Rachel, in the
most
expressive
accent
of affection, what a pity he
should
die.
Then my father is a
sachem
,
said
Reuben; and
the
seeds
of ambition which nature had implanted,
but which till that moment had lain dormant in his
bosom
,
started
into life. At the account of their
grandfather's death, the children both
sobbed
audibly.
I will! I am determined I will! go to
America
,
said
Reuben,
first
suppressing
his emotions.
What, without me, brother?
asked
Rachel, in a
mournful voice.
No, no, he replied, not without you, but when
I am a man we will go together; we will find out our
grandfather's government, and
discover
ourselves
to
his people; I dare
say
they would be glad to
see
us,
since
they loved him
so
well.
But what
should
we go there for, brother? I am
sure
we are very happy here, and papa would not be
willing to part with us, and aunt Rachel too would
miss
us.
Well, then, I will go, and leave you with them,
and when I have
settled
myself
in my government, I
will
send
for you all. Oh! what a fine
house
I will
have, and then what a number of
servants
, and
horses
,
and coaches.
Aunt Rachel
smiled
, to hear how eagerly the fancy
of youth catches at the hope of future
greatness
, and
how readily they connect the ideas of grandeur,
affluence
,
and numerous attendants, to the
possession
of a
title. She gazed for a moment with
pleasure
on his
intelligent countenance, which the emotions of his
little
swelling
heart had lighted up with uncommon
animation
;
and
paused
, unwilling to throw a damp on
those
delightful
sensations
he appeared to enjoy. At
length, What would you
say
, cried
she
, if I were
to tell you that your grandfather had no attendants
except a few warriors, who, from voluntary
attachment
to his
person
, followed to protect him from
danger
;
that he had neither
horse
nor carriage; that his
palace was chiefly
composed
of the bark of trees; that
his bed was the
skins
of wild
beasts
, and his
seat
of
state
the trunk of an old tree, hewn into
something
resembling
a chair, covered with beaver and other
skins
,
and its ornaments the teeth of tygers,
polished
shells
and
fish
bones?
But he was good,
said
Rachel, and
consequently
happy.
And he was brave and
wise
,
said
Reuben
exultingly
,
and every body loved him.
Sweet children,
said
aunt Rachel,
those
are
consequences
which ought ever to follow
goodness
,
bravery and
wisdom
. But, alas! they are not always
certain.
What, then, are not all good
persons
happy?
Not always in their outward
circumstances
; but
they enjoy internal peace.
And are not the brave and the
wise
always
esteemed
?
By
those
who have
sense
and
discernment
they in
general are; but unfortunately, great and
shining
qualifications, of either mind or
person
, excite in
general
more envy than love.
What is envy, aunt?
A
passion
, my dear Rachel, to which I hope you
will ever remain a
stranger
. With this
wish
the good
old lady
kissed
the children, and
dismissed
them to
bed.
CHAP. II.
Education may
polish
the Manners, but Human Nature
will be
still
the
same
.
Though
the father of our hero and heroine
was a man moderate in his
wishes
, and of that
reasonable
cast
of mind that preferred mediocrity to
affluence; yet he conceived it an
indispensable
duty to
endeavour to improve his fortune for the
sake
of his
children. He had retained
some
faint idea of the
beauty
and fertility of the American continent; he
also
felt an
irresistible
impulse
to
visit
once more the place
of his nativity; and a number of families, of his own
persuasion
, about this period emigrating to the colony
of
Pennsylvania
,
amongst
whom were
some
of his
wife's
nearest
relations, he collected together all the
ready money he was
master
of, and turning it into
such
merchandize as was
most
likely to be productive
of emolument, embarked with a
design
of
purchasing
land, building a
house
, and putting the whole in
such
a
state
of cultivation, as might render it at once a
pleasant
and profitable habitation for his children,
when arrived to the age of maturity.
How naturally do we expect our children, or
those
in
whose
welfare we are
interested
, to adopt the
sentiments
most
congenial to our own feelings, without
considering
that nature is as various in the formation
of the minds of men, as of their faces; and
those
pursuits
and acquirements, which to one will give the
most
superlative
delight, to another would bring only
misery
. Thus the father of Rachel and Reuben,
being
himself
a man of peace, fond of retirement and the
study
of agriculture, thought he could not render
them a more acceptable
service
, than to prepare them
a habitation, where they might enjoy uninterrupted
quiet; where plenty would
preside
at the board, and
the
study
of nature, in all her varieties and beauties,
enliven
solitude
.
He placed his
son
at a public
school
to
finish
his
education, and making proper arrangements for the
support
of his family during his
absence
(which he
imagined would be about two years) he
entrusted
Rachel
to the care of her aunt, with
instructions
, that in
case
of death
she
should
remove to the
house
, and
submit
to the direction of her maternal uncle, Hezekiah
Penn.
Reuben and Rachel were in their thirteenth year
when this
separation
took place. Their tears fell at
the idea of being parted from their father; but when
the brother and
sister
were informed that, during a
period of two years, they
must
not expect to meet
only
R
at each returning
Christmas
, their grief was beyond
expression
.
When the carriage came to the door that was to
convey Reuben from her, Rachel
burst
into an agony
of tears. My brother! my dear, dear brother!
she
cried, hanging round his neck.
God
bless
you, my charming
sister
! my dear,
amiable
sister
! cried he.
Aunt Rachel drew her niece from the door, from
the parting embrace of her brother (who was led to
the carriage by his father) and by degrees
composed
and
consoled
her.
It cannot be
supposed
that their father was an
unmoved
spectator
of this affecting
scene
. No! he felt
and
compassionated
their
sufferings
; but he knew that
a maiden aunt and
sequestered
mansion
, would in no
wise
prepare his
son
for the active
scenes
of life in which
(however contrary to his own
wishes
) he would
most
likely hereafter engage.
His family concerns being now
settled
to his
satisfaction
,
he embarked for
Pennsylvania
. His
commercial
plans were executed with great
success
, his
intended
purchase
made on very advantageous terms, and
at the
close
of the third year from his
first
arrival, he
prepared again to
visit
England. Mr. Dudley had
taken from Europe with him a
distant
relation of his
wife's, a young man, of whom, as he will make a
considerable
figure in the
ensuing
pages, it may not be
thought an
unnecessary
digression
to give
some
account.
The mother of Jacob Holmes was niece to the
father
of
Cassiah
Penn. She had been left an orphan in
early infancy; but the
loss
of parents was amply
supplied
by her benevolent uncle and aunt. She was
nearly of the
same
age with their own daughter, and,
brought up with her, received the
same
benefit of
education
.
When
Cassiah
married the father of our
hero
and heroine, Mary Holmes continued with her
aunt, and by tender
assiduity
endeavoured to prevent
her feeling too acutely the privation of her daughter's
society
. Mary was naturally
sincere
and
artless
; but
Mary was
handsome
, and loved to be told of her
beauty
.
She
possessed
what is in general termed one of
the
best
dispositions
in the world,
because
she
seldom
took the trouble to contradict any one. Her
easiness
might, without much exaggeration, have been termed
indolence; and her extreme good-nature, folly and
want of feeling. To
praise
her beauty, was to win
her heart; and being often extolled for her
sweetness
and
evenness
of temper,
she
conceived, that to be
perfectly
passive
was to be perfectly amiable; and Mary,
with a face extremely lovely, and a form captivating,
possessed
neither
expression
of countenance, nor
sensibility
of heart; but like
some
kinds of tropical fruits,
which, when ripe, are
so
sweet
as to be
insipid
, and,
though beautiful to the eye, have neither poignancy
or flavour to delight the
taste
. She had loved her
cousin
Cassiah
with as much
tenderness
as her nature
was capable of;
she
thought her the
most
perfect of
human beings; and
whilst
Cassiah
was her
constant
companion, Mary was free from error.
In the neighbourhood of the dwelling of Obadiah
Penn, was the ancient
seat
of the family of the
Fitzgeralds
.
Arthur Fitzgerald was an only child; his
father had been dead many years; his mother's
indulgence
had been unbounded; and at the age of
twenty-five, Arthur had
scarcely
ever known what it was
ro be contradicted. Heir at once to the
estates
of his
father and the hereditary honours of his mother; a
descendant
of the
house
of Aumerle, of which he was
the
last
male branch, Arthur thought the chief end of
his
existence
was
pleasure
; and though
possessed
of a
good
understanding
, and a not naturally corrupt
heart, he often performed actions which did honour to
humanity; yet unlimited indulgence and unclouded
prosperity
, by degrees rendered
those
divine
impulses
of nature,
compassion
and benevolence, weaker and
weaker, till at length his heart
ceased
to be influenced
by either.
His mother, lady Allida, chiefly
resided
at the
Pinery
,
the name the
seat
had taken from its being
surrounded
by a deep wood of pine trees. Mrs. Pinup
was lady Allida's chief attendant, and
superintendant
of her
household
in general. Though it might be
supposed
, that the
vast
distance
pride places between
the family of a woman of quality in actual
possession
of eight
thousand
pounds a year, and expectant of
twice the
sum
, and that of a
simple
country
gentleman
,
whose
whole annual income did not exceed eight
hundred, did not allow of any
intercourse
between
lady
Allida Fitzgerald, and the wife of Obadiah Penn;
but the
servants
of
those
families
sometimes
met, and
Mrs. Pinup, in the extreme
condescension
of her heart,
and
likewise
having her mind fixed on
some
excellent
raspberry
brandy (which the old lady kept as a
wholesome
stomachic
)
sometimes
paid a
visit
to dame Prue,
upper
servant
in Mr. Penn's family.
In
some
of
these
visits
, Mrs. Pinup had often
seen
both
Cassiah
and Mary; but there was always a
modest
dignity in the manner of the former, that repelled
any approach to familiarity from
persons
whose
education
,
manners and
station
rendered them unfit
companions
;
yet it was a dignity no ways tinctured with
haughtiness
. She was ever gentle and affable,
so
much
so
as to be a
universal
favourite, from the
highest
to the
lowest
.
But Mary would laugh with the maids; and though
respect
for her as their
master
's niece, kept the
menservants
in
some
awe,
she
endured from them familiar
praises
of her beauty, not only without
resentment
, but
even with
such
an apparent degree of
satisfaction
as
encouraged, rather than repelled their freedom.
Sometimes, when Mrs. Pinup was there,
she
would go
down
stairs
purposely
to chat with her,
ask
a
thousand
questions
about lady Allida, the
house
, the
quetions">questions
about lady Allida, the
house
, the
pleasure-grounds
,
and other more
insignificant
subjects
,
such
as
her
dress
, the
fashion
of it; for Mary Holmes was no
Quaker in her heart, and would often pull off her
close
mob, and let her hair, which was very fine, fall
loosely
over her
shoulders
. But if the more
sedate
Cassiah
ever beheld any of
these
signs
of vanity,
she
would
mildly reprove them, and as Mary feared to offend
her, the would ever
restrain
them in her
presence
.
Mrs. Pinup, ever communicative, and wonderfully
eloquent in the
praise
of lady Allida, would expatiate
for hours on her grandeur, her rich clothes, her
house
,
her plate, and jewels; nay,
she
often
asked
dame Prue
to come and bring the young ladies to
see
all
these
fine things.
Cassiah
uniformly
refused
these
invitations,
but Mary, though
submissive
to the
superior
wisdom
of her
cousin
,
secretly
wished
to accept them.
On the marriage of
Cassiah
, her mother
accompanied
her home, and remained with her as a
visitor
nearly
a month. During this time, the
heedless
Mary,
unable to combat her inclinations, though
she
knew
they were wrong, yielded to the
solicitations
of dame
Prue, and accompanied her to the Pinery. Lady
Allida
was
absent
for the day. Mrs. Pinup led her
guests
through the antique and
superbly
furnished
apartments. The rich velvet canopies, the
stately
beds, the
massy
silver
cups, large marble tables with
burnished
supporters
, China
vases
, large
looking-glasses
,
and beautiful
tapestry
, were gazed on by Mary
with wonder and delight. Plenty,
unrestrained
by
parsimony
,
presided
over every department of the
household
economy of Obadiah Penn. His furniture was
excellent in its kind, but it was plain.
The wardrobe was next
displayed
. The rich
tissue
,
brocaded or velvet
suits
were in turns the object of
her admiration and
desire
. The fine lace pinners, the
diamond earings, necklace, and other ornamentsOh!
how fine! how beautiful! how elegant! was
repeated
a hundred times.
Well,
said
Mary, I wonder how I
should
look,
dressed
in
some
of this finery?
Look! why like an angel, I'm
sure
,
said
Mrs.
Pinup. Oh! there is nothing like
dress
, to
set
off a
pretty face; and if you look
so
handsome
in that
brown
padusuoy
gown and plain
muslin
cap, how do
you think you would look in a full
dress
suit
?
Mary was holding a rich blue
silk
robe in her hand
at the moment;
she
held it up
against
her
side
. The
delicacy of the colour was exactly
suited
to her
complexion
;
the effect it had gave an additional
flush
to
R 2
her cheek. It was a
loose
robe, made with open
sleeves
, and
fastened
at the
bosom
with a diamond
clasp
. The ground was blue, but it was
superbly
embroidered
with
silver
, and round the neck and
sleeves
was a net of
silver
thread.
Put it on,
said
Mrs. Pinup.
The
fashion
of the
dress
was
such
as partly to
expose
the neck. The neck of Mary was covered with
a fine cambrick handkerchief. Mrs. Pinup took it
off; and then,
slipping
the robe over her other clothes,
fastened
it at the
bosom
,
released
her luxurious flaxen
hair from the confinement of the cap, and turning her
to the
glass
,
said
, What do you think of
yourself
now?
Dame Prue
sat
by, a
silent
spectatress
of this
scene
.
She was too good-natured to condemn, and too
wise
wholly to approve. Mary gazed and
smiled
, walked
along the room to admire
herself
at full length in the
glass
, and
said
, in a tone
expressive
of mortification,
Well, I
shall
never like
myself
in my Quaker
dress
again.
With this
expression
,
she
turned with a
design
of
throwing off her borrowed plumes, when
she
beheld a
young man,
whose
dress
bespoke
him of
consequence
,
entering the apartment. He
stopped
for a moment; he
looked unutterable admiration; then exclaimed, in an
accent of wonder, Angel!
goddess
! bright divinity!
Covered with
confusion
, Mary would have
escaped
through the
opposite
door; but he
saw
her
design
,
and
seizing
her hand,
besought
her not to be alarmed.
Compose
yourself
, lovely creature,
said
he, I
meant not to frighten you.
I did not know you were in the
house
, Sir,
said
Pinup, in evident
confusion
.
I have not been in ten minutes,
said
he. I
intended
to
dress
and join my mother at lord Aumerle's,
but while Le Beau was
settling
my peruke, he
informed
me, if I would come up into my mother's
dreing-room
,
I
should
see
, one of the
prettiest
Quakers in the
world. But I
see
a
celestial
being. A Quaker! what!
shall
those
lovely
tresses
be concealed, that enchanting
form be
disfigured
by their puritanical, formal
dress
?
Forbid it, all ye loves and graces.
Mary had neither
sensibility
nor
discernment
sufficient
to comprehend the
insult
to which
she
had
exposed
herself
, in thus
associating
with the
servants
of a
family, who, if her
superior
in point of fortune, was
not of a more elevated
descent
. But the feelings of
Mary were never very
troublesome
to her, and the
Lethean draught of flattery her ears had drank,
intoxicated
her
senses
and perverted her
understanding
.
Instead
of
resenting
the freedom of Fitzgerald's
address
,
she
was
silent
, and her heart
secretly
exulted at having
excited his admiration.
Instead
of
insisting
on going
immediately home,
she
threw
aside
her
sumptuous
and
imprudently
assumed
ornaments, and in her own
simple
attire
descended
to the
housekeeper
's apartment, where
refreshments
were
served
, of which Arthur partook.
The evening approached. Dame Prue
arose
to
depart
.
I will
see
you
safe
through the Pinery,
said
Arthur. The moon was
rising
in full, unclouded
majesty
.
The evening was calm, mild and inviting.
My lady will not return till late,
said
Pinup; I
think I will go a little way with them
myself
, and not
trouble you, Sir.
I thought you knew, Pinup,
said
Arthur, that
I never do any thing that I conceive a trouble. You
shall
accompany the old gentlewoman, and I will
offer
my arm to the young divinity.
How
silver
-
sweet
found lovers' tongues by night,'
says
our immortal
Shakespeare
; and who
so
well
understood
human nature, its
weakness
, its virtues, its
passions
; who
so
well delineate?
The extent of the Pinery was a mile and a half;
yet the meadow, the
stream
that watered it, and the
hill on the
side
of which
stood
the
mansion
of
Obadiah
,
appeared to view before they thought they had
walked half way. For Arthur Fitzgerald talked of
love, and Mary Holmes, though incapable of
seeling
a
real
passion
,
listened
in delighted
silence
to the voice
of adulation.
Dame Prue was confident Mrs. Dudley would not
greatly approve her own
visit
to the Pinery, much
more, that
she
should
have taken her niece with her.
She therefore
desired
Mary to be
silent
on the
subject
.
Mary was not inclined to
speak
upon it to any one. Had
Arthur taken no methods to
see
this weak girl again,
in all probability, the
transient
liking
she
had
conceived
for him would have died away; but Arthur,
unaccustomed
to put any
restraint
on his
passions
, and
being greatly charmed with the beauty of the fair
Quaker, without once
considering
the
consequence
of
seducing
so
young,
so
lovely a creature from the paths
of rectitude, wrote to her in a
style
of
submissive
adoration
,
and implored her, if
she
wished
to
save
him
from
despair
, to meet him at the margin of the brook
in the meadow. Mary complied; repeated
interviews
ensued
, and
she
fell a victim, not to
sensibility
or
passion
No; Mary Holmes was the victim of
vanity
and too great pliability of temper.
Conscious
of
her deviation from virtue, the
presence
of her virtuous
aunt became painful to her; yet did
she
not experience
the laudable kind of
uneasiness
which leads to
repentance
and amendment.
Indifference is the lethargy of the
soul
; it is the
grave of virtue and excellence. Indifference acts upon
the mental faculties, as indolence does on the body;
for as the man who indulges in inactivity can never
expect to
rise
into notice,
secure
or amend his fortune,
so
the
soul
incrusted
in indifference is incapable of
inciting
one great or glorious action. It conceives not
the beauty of virtue, nor the real deformity of vice.
Its affections are cold; its
pleasures
so
languid, they
scarce
deserve
the name. Its pains are few indeed.
But then what
satisfaction
does the
possessor
lose
! The
beauties of creation are unfolded to him in vain; in vain
the gorgeous canopy of heaven
displays
ten
thousand
thousand
moving worlds, that, as they roll in the
expanse
of ether, contribute to
embellish
, cheer and warm
the globe which we inhabit; in vain the teeming earth
brings forth her fruit; nor field of ripened grain, nor
opening flower, nor flock, nor herd, afford one joy for
him. He gazes at them all with
stupid
vacuity of
thought, and wonders at the grateful tear that
springs
to the eye from the heart of
sensibility
.
The
history
of poor Mary is
soon
finished
. She left
the protection of her uncle, and accompanied
Fitzgerald
to London.
Disspation
of every kind was
rushed
into with avidity. Her
purse
was liberally
supplied
by her
seducer
; her
house
was elegant; her
equipage gay; her
dress
always
splendid
, and not
seldom
capriciously
extravagant. But though beauty
may
fascinate
the
senses
, prudence, virtue, and a good
understanding
, are
necessary
to make the charm
powerful
and
lasting
. Fitzgerald grew weary of her folly
and
profusion
; he
forsook
her; yet not
ungenerously
.
He
settled
sufficient
on her to procure all the comforts
and
some
of the elegancies of life. But, alas! Mary
was
still
young,
still
lovely, and
still
indifferent. The
opinion of the world was of little
consequence
to her;
nor
scarcely
one individual in it was more regarded
than another. Adulation
she
sought
, and it was
poured in upon her from every quarter. She regretted
not the
desertion
of Fitzgerald; another and another
spoiler
came; and Mary Holmes
sunk
into the
lowest
abyss
of guilt and
shame
.
CHAP. III.
We all know what we are, but we know not what we
may be
.
That
misery
is ever the certain concomitant of
guilt, is
universally
allowed an incontrovertible
fact. Mary Holmes, with as little reflection or feeling
as it is
possible
for a rational being to
possess
, was a
proof of the truth of this
assertion
.
Dissipation
,
whilst
it had the charms of novelty, intoxicated her
senses
,
and kept her mind in
such
continued employment, that
her generous uncle Obadiah, her affectionate
cousin
Cassiah
, home, the brook, the meadow, and the Pinery,
were all forgotten in the
constant
vortex of folly. But the
same
scene
, however
fascinating
at
first
, by continual
repetition
loses
its charms, and becomes
insipid
and
disgusting
.
So Mary, often in the
midst
of
noisy
mirth and
tumultuous
pleasure
, would
cast
a
wishful
, though
transient
thought, towards her uncle's quiet parlour, and the
tranquil
happiness
that was ever her companion there.
Seven years had
passed
, and Mary was no longer
followed, courted and admired. She had
lost
her
most
powerful charm. Her cheek was no longer
suffused
with the
crimson
of timidity, nor her manners
attractive
from that feminine
bashfulness
, which renders even
a plain woman agreeable; and a beautiful woman on
whose
brow
sits
modest
bashfulness
, enthroned in native
purity, ever is, ever will be,
irresistible
. But, alas!
when virtue has
forsaken
the heart, the vermillion of
chastity
ceases
to
visit
the cheek, and beauty without
it, however
exquisite
, can catch even the eye but for a
moment. Charmed with the
most
finished
workmanship
of nature, we look for the
soul
that
should
inform
it. But we find it blotted!
disgraced
!
lost
!
Admiration
ceases
; pity
succeeds
; and
whilst
we
wish
to
reform, we cannot but
despise
.
Mary had arrived at this
last
stage
.
Forsaken
by
the men, her vanity was no longer gratified; and to
enliven her home, where could
she
find,
amongst
the
unhappy females with whom
she
had been
accustomed
to
associate
, one
whose
conversation
could either
amuse
or
instrust
her.
Unaccustomed
, even in her
happiest
days, to
seek
amusement
within
herself
, it cannot be
supposed
,
when
sin
and
shame
had laid all
waste
,
she
could find
pleasure
in reflection.
The life of Mary was a continued blank; unloving,
unloved.
Joyless
passed
her days; nor
wish
, nor
hope, nor fear
diversified
it; all was inanimation.
At this period
she
found
herself
in the
most
interesting
situation
a female can experience. She was about
to become a mother. If Mary ever was
sensible
of
any thing like
remorse
, it was on this
occasion
. She
wished
she
had not
swerve
from the path of rectitude;
she
wished
her child had not been the offspring of
shame
.
It was about the middle of April. The meadows
began to
assume
a cheerful appearance; the fruit trees,
rich in
blushing
sweets
,
scented
the air with
persume
,
more grateful to the
sense
than the
most
costly
compound
of art. Mary's health had been impaired, by
midnight vigils, riot and intemperance. She
sought
,
from the
freshness
of the country air, a
reinstatement
of it, and a relief from that
lassitude
and inanity which
weighed upon her
spirits
; a neat cottage but a few
miles from London became her refidence.
Late one evening, as
she
was preparing to retire to
rest
, the
sound
of a carriage driving
hastily
by,
attracted
her attention. In a moment the
noise
of the wheels
ceased
; a
sudden
shriek
was heard, and then all was
silent
.
Why, as
sure
as can be, ma'am,
said
the
servant
who was helping her to
undress
, the carriage is either
broke down or
overset
.
I hope not, Dolly,
she
replied, going to the
window
to
listen
. Before
she
had time to unbar the
shutters
and
raise
the
sash
, a loud ring at the gate
announced
an unexpected
visitor
. It was the
person
who drove the carriage; it had been overturned; a
lady in it was hurt, and her
husband
had
sent
him to
request
they might be permitted to
repose
for the
night in her
house
, as the carriage had been
so
damaged
as to render it
impossible
for them to proceed on
their journey.
Mary was not deficient in the knowledge, nor
backward
in the performance of the rites of
hospitality
.
The
strangers
shall
be welcome,
said
she
, to
every accommodation my humble
mansion
affords.
The lady had fainted; for her arm was
dislocated
,
and the pain had overcome her natural fortitude.
A gentleman,
assisted
by his
servant
, bore her into the
house
; their
dress
struck
on the heart of Mary. She
went to the
sofa
on which the fair
insensible
was laid,
with a
design
of
administering
volatiles and a
restorative
cordial. She
raised
her head, which was reclined
on her
husband
's
shoulder
, and beheld the features of
Cassiah
. Her hands trembled, her cheek turned pale.
My
cousin
!
said
she
. Mr. Dudley looked at her
with attention, and, though decorated in the
habiliments
of vanity, recognized the conntenance of Mary
Holmes.
But little now remains to be told. The hurt
Cassiah
had received, confined her above a week, during
which time Mary was delivered of a
son
. The advice
and admonitions of her friends determined her to
abjure
a way of life, into which
she
had been
first
seduced
by want of
resolution
, and in which, want of
resolution
alone could have induced her to continue.
Business
of importance had brought Dudley from
the country; and, prompted at once by affection for
her
husband
, and a
wish
to
see
the capital,
Cassiah
was
induced to accompany him. The
desired
ends fully
accomplished
, they prepared to return.
Come, Mary,
said
Cassiah
, throw off
these
trappings
of vanity; they become not the penitent.
Assume
the
dress
of
simplicity
and purity, in which thou
wert wont to appear. Return with a noble
firmness
,
to the man who
seduced
thee, the wages of thy guilt, the
price of thy
dishonour
. I pray thee, Mary Holmes,
return to the
bosom
of thy friends, to the paths of
innocence
and virtue. Albeit thy good uncle Obadiah
is no more, yet I and my brother Hezekiah are his
representatives
. Had he been living, and thou
hadst
returned repentant, he would have exceedingly
rejoiced
;
would have killed the
satted
calf, and have bid his
friends and neighbours to come and welcome thee.
And
shall
not we perform the will of our
deceased
father? Yea, verily will we,
since
in
so
doing we
shall
also
perform the will of our Father who is in heaven.
Dear Mary, turn not a deaf ear to my prayer; for
the ways of truth are the ways of
pleasantness
, and
where innocence dwells, dwells
also
peace
forevermore
.
Mary
must
have been
insensible
indeed to have
rejected
the
earnest
solicitations
of her amiable relation.
Every feeling of the force and beauty of virtue was
now powerfully awakened and called into action. She
returned the
settlement
she
had received from
Fitzgerald
,
and accompanied Dudley and
Cassiah
into
Lancashire
,
where a few years put a period to her
existence
.
Mr. Dudley had from his birth adopted her
son
Jacob Holmes; and when he embarked for
America
,
Jacob accompanied him, was
witness
to every
transaction
on that
side
the Atlantic, enjoyed his
unlimited
confidence, and when he
proposed
returning to
Europe, Jacob was
entrusted
with a copy of his will,
the title-deeds of the newly
purchased
estate
, and left
in
possession
of it, with directions to
spare
neither
cost
nor pains to improve, cultivate and beautify it.
CHAP. IV.
Things as they were, as they are, and as they ever will be.
Reuben
and Rachel had, during the
absence
of
their father,
increased
in
stature
, and improved
in mental acquirements. Their
persons
were much
altered for the better. Rachel was now approaching
womanhood; tall,
straight
, and well-proportioned.
An intelligent animation lighted up her countenance,
which
prepossessed
the beholder, at
first
sight
, in her
favour. It was that kind of
honest
countenance in
which you might read every emotion of the heart, and
seemed
to
say
, I cannot deceive you, if I would.
Reuben
almost
idolized his
sister
, and when the
holidays
permitted his annual
visit
, never were three
human
beings more
superlatively
happy, than the brother,
sister
, and aunt Rachel. It was in one of
these
visits
,
as they were
socially
seated
round their fire, their
family
party enlivened by the company of a
Miss
Oliver,
who was
passing
the winter with her grandmother, in
the neighbourhood, when a letter was brought. It
is from your father,
said
aunt Rachel; take it,
Reuben, and read it. Reuben broke the
seal
, and
read as follows.
S
IT is with
satisfaction
of the
purest
kind, that I
take up my pen to inform my dear aunt Rachel and my
beloved children, that the
business
which brought me to
this place is at length
finished
, and the completion of
it is equal to my
most
sanguine
expectations.
The
purchase
of the land, (which is delightfully
situated
on the banks of the Schuylkill, within a
pleasant
ride of Philadelphia) the building of the
house
,
barn,
stable
, &c. in
such
a
style
as might unite a
degree
of
simple
elegance with convenience, the
stocking
the farm, and other contingencies, have led me
rather to exceed the
sum
I
first
sat
out with, though
that was greatly augmented by trade; and I have
been
necessitated
to give bills on England for five
hundred
pounds; but they are at
such
a date as will
enable
me to reach home before they become due, or
should
I not, I have given my agent, Mr. Atkins,
instructions
to
sell
part of the
Lancashire
estate
, if he has
not in his hands money
sufficient
to pay the bills
without
.
You will, therefore, without
hesitation
,
acquiesce
in whatever arrangements he may make for that
purpose
.
I intend embarking for England about the end of
October, and hope to
see
you all before the new year
commences.
I
suppose
my darlings, Reuben and Rachel, are
almost
grown out of knowledge. I would have
answered
their letters, but time
presses
. I am
pleased
with their evident improvement in writing and
orthography
.
Tell Reuben here will be an ample field for
his
aspiring
and
inquisitive
genius. Tell him, at the
same
time, I
wish
him ever to
aspire
to be eminently
good; for that only can render him eminently great.
Tell my
dearest
Rachel, that if
she
emulates the
virtues
and perfections of her
sainted
mother,
she
will be
every thing that is amiable. Fare thee well. May
the Creator and
Preserver
of the
universe
guard,
protect
,
and keep you all.
R. DUDLEY.
P. S. I
shall
leave Jacob Holmes in care of my
estate
here. I
shall
also
leave him a trifle to put him
in a little way of
business
, that by prudence and
industry
he may render
himself
independent. The man
who depends for the
necessaries
of life on a patron,
can never
assert
that freedom of
spirit
which is the
natural prerogative of every human being. Jacob is
serious
,
assiduous
, and
serupulously
conscientious
in all
his dealings. I have placed an unlimited confidence
in him, and am firm in the belief that he will never
abuse
it. Once more, God
bless
you.
So then,
said
Reuben, his fine eyes beaming with
pleasure
,
so
then, my father intends that we
shall
all
go to America. Well, I always
earnestly
wished
to
go, and I find I
shall
be gratified.
But brother,
said
Rachel, look at the date of
my father's letter, and remember what he
said
about
sailing
in October: why, my dear brother, he will be
home very
soon
.
He may arrive in a few days,
said
aunt Rachel.
A few days! cried Reuben eagerly, why he
may arrive this very night.
Oh dear! dear Reuben, do you think
so
?
Yes; and perhaps in
six
weeks or two months
time we may be all on the Atlantic ocean.
Bless
me!
Miss
Oliver, are you not well?
This
question
and exclamation, which Reuben
addressed
to their fair
visitor
, was extorted by
sudden
surprise
.
He had
casually
glanced his eye towards her
as he was
speaking
, and beheld her
interesting
countenance
pale as
ashes
.
What is the matter,
Jessy
Oliver?
said
Rachel,
whose
attention was awakened by her brother's
question
;
is the room too warm?
No! no! my dear,
said
Jessy
in tremulous
accents
;
only! only! indeed I don't know what ails
me; but I was
seized
With a
sudden
sickness
at the mention of the
Atlantic
ocean,
said
Hezekiah Penn, who had been
smoking
his pipe in one corner of the room.
The dry manner in which he
spoke
, the look he
cast
towards her, recalled the
roses
to the cheeks of
Jessy
.
She affected to laugh at the idea; but it was not the
laugh of nature. Her heart was full, and her eyes
had nearly betrayed its feelings. Reuben was at
first
surprised
; but he looked on the
confused
fair one,
and an idea
crossed
his mind which gave birth to a
sentiment
which could not be
extinguished
but with
life.
Jessy
Oliver was two years older than our hero and
heroine; extremely lovely in her
person
,
accomplished
in her manners, and endowed with an
understanding
far
superior
to the generality of her
sex
. She was
sedate
beyond her years; but that
sedateness
was the
offspring of
sorrow
,
occasioned
by the
loss
of her
mother
when
she
was about twelve years old;
soon
after
which, her father unthinkingly united
himself
with a
young, volatile woman of quality, who, though
she
brought him a very ample fortune, yet by her
extravagance
,
threatened him with ruin, and by her
levty
,
with
dishonour
.
Jessy
had a brother, one year younger than
herself
.
Archibald Oliver was
classmate
with Reuben, and had
twice invited him to his father's country-
house
, which
was in
Oxfordshire
, to
pass
a few days in the
midsummer
vacation. This
friendship
between the young
men naturally led to an intimacy with the
sister
; and
Jessy
, without a thought which
she
would
blush
to own,
was tenderly attached to Reuben.
Her
situation
at home became
disagreeable
in the
extreme. Fond of reading, drawing, needle-work,
and every elegant
domestic
employment; without
affectation
;
delicate in her manners and
conversation
,
and
sincerely
pious; it cannot be imagined that
Jessy
could find
pleasure
in the
society
of a woman,
ignorant
,
dissipated
and irreligious.
To her maternal grandmother
she
wrote, in
confidence
,
the
miseries
of her
situation
, and received from
her an invitation to
pass
the winter with her in
Lancashire
.
Perhaps the
visit
was not anticipated with
less
satisfaction
because
in the neighbourhood of the
family of Reuben Dudley. Not that
Jessy
was
conscious
of being too partial to him; but that
she
expected
much
pleasure
from the
society
of his
sister
and
aunt, of whom
she
had often heard him
speak
with
enthusiasm
.
She was charmed with the unaffected
naivette
of
Rachel, and the more
she
knew of her the more
she
loved her; and though unperceived by
herself
, the
friendship
she
conceived for the
sister
strengthened
her
partiality for the brother. Their
persons
were alike,
as much
so
as it was
possible
for a face truly feminine,
strikingly
to
resemble
one
whose
features are more
marked, more manly, more
expressive
of character.
Jessy
looked at Rachel with admiration. How much
you are like your brother,
she
would
say
. Alas!
poor
Jessy
;
she
was
unconscious
, that it was that
resemblance
which chiefly drew her heart, with
irresistible
power, towards her new friend. The mind of
Jessy
was as pure as the
chaste
dew which glitters in an
April morn upon the
bosom
of a half-blown
snowdrop
;
and when with
undissembled
joy
she
flew to
meet him on his arrival in
Lancashire
, and
presented
her hand and
smiling
mouth to greet him, it was with
the
sensations
of a
seraph
who welcomes a kindred
spirit
to the
mansions
of the
blest
.
Oh why! why! is this pure, this
unimpassioned
intercourse
between the
sexes
,
so
rare, as to be
almost
incredible
?
Alas! it is a humiliating truth to own;
but human nature is
so
weak,
so
liable to error, that
its
purest
emotions may be
construed
into guilt, and,
conscious
of our own imbecility, we tremble for the
firmness
of another.
Besides
, wherever beauty,
sense
,
or merit dwells, there envy hovers round, with
haggard
eye, and pale,
distorted
brow; the
poison
falling
from her baleful tongue
discolours
every object, and
casts
on even innocence
itself
a
sallow
, doubtful hue.
Oh! how happy, how
superlatively
happy, is the
youthful, inexperienced, yet
susceptible
bosom
!
Charm'd with each object that it meets,
Blythe as the vernal morn,
It from the
rose
inhales the
sweets
,
Nor feels nor dreads the thorn;
When hope, unfetter'd, pure as light,
Free as the
passing
wind,
S 2
Bounds forward
still
with
chaste
delight,
Nor
sees
the
storm
, nor heeds the night,
That threatens
close
behind.
Thus pure, thus
susceptible
, thus
fearless
of evil,
were the hearts of Reuben, Rachel, and their fair friend
Jessy
Oliver; when on the evening
just
mentioned, the
reception of the letter, the
eagerness
Reuben
expressed
to embark for America, and the remark uncle
Hezekiah
made on the
sudden
sickness
of
Jessy
, awakened
new ideas in the
breasts
of all.
Reuben had folded up his father's letter, returned it
to his aunt, and
seated
himself
beside
Jessy
, took her
passive
hand, and
seemed
for a moment
busied
in
counting over and over again, the beautifully white
and finely tapering fingers. Rachel
seated
herself
on
the other
side
, and
asked
, with innocent
earnestness
,
if
she
was not better now.
Yes, replied
Jessy
,
almost
unconscious
that
she
spoke
at all.
I thought you were,
said
Rachel, with the
greatest
simplicity
; for the colour is returned to your lips
and cheeks.
The remark did not make her paler. And when
uncle Hezekiah,
adjusting
his broad-brimmed beaver,
and putting on his great coat, bade Reuben talk no
more of the Atlantic ocean, America, and
such
frightful
things, the lily was entirely exchanged for the
carnation
.
Hezekiah went to the door, with a
design
to go
home; his
horse
had been
previously
brought out.
But he opened the door, and ordering the poor
beast
back to the
stable
, returned to the parlour, and
protested
that it
stormed
tremendously
.
Does the wind blow very hard uncle?
said
Rachel.
Yes, replied Hezekiah, deliberately
seating
himself
,
and filling another pipe.
And does it blow on
shore
?
said
aunt Rachel,
who, having experienced the dangers of the
sea
herself
,
felt more
sensibly
the perils to which her nephew
might be
exposed
,
should
he be coming near the land
on
such
a
stormy
night.
It blows
strongly
from the
sea
,
said
Hezekiah,
drawing in a
vast
quantity of
smoke
, and then
suffering
it gradually to evaporate, as it
escaped
in
small
curling clouds from his mouth.
As he
spoke
, a
sudden
gust
rushed
impetuously
by
the
house
, and
shook
the apartment in which they were
sitting
.
Does it
snow
or rain, brother?
said
Rachel.
It
snows
,
said
Hezekiah, not giving Reuben
time to reply; it
snows
, and is very dark indeed.
At that moment, the
discharge
of a
distant
cannon
was heard; and Hezekiah,
dashing
his pipe on the
hearth,
started
from his
seat
, and exclaimed, There
is
some
ship
in
distress
. Before any one could reply,
another and another gun was heard, and the
servant
and
carriage arriving for
Miss
Oliver, they were informed
that a
ship
had been
seen
in the offing, before dark, as
it was
supposed
, endeavouring to make the port of
Liverpool; but that
she
appeared much
disabled
in
her
masts
, yards and rigging, and it was imagined
she
was now on
shore
, or in imminent danger.
It was not the
remonstrances
or entreaties of his
friends, that could now
restrain
the
impetuosity
of
Reuben. He was
prepossessed
with the idea that his
father was in the
vessel
, and he would
set
off
immediately
for Liverpool. He might be enabled to
send
relief
to the
distressed
mariners.
Oh! my dear brother, it is
impossible
,
said
Rachel
;
only hear how the wind roars.
I do hear it, he replied mournfully, and every
blast
seems
to
say
, Reuben, thy father is
perishing
.
A momentary
silence
now
ensued
, when Hezekiah
proposed
going with his nephew. I do not think,
said
he, that we can render them any
service
; but
suspense
is painful, and we may at
least
learn earlier
intelligence
of the fate of the
vessel
and her unfortunate
crew;
discover
from whence
she
came, and what
passengers
were on board.
Then
promise
you will not attempt to go off in
a boat, my dear Reuben,
said
Rachel.
Oh heavens! he will not
surely
think of
such
a
thing, exclaimed
Miss
Oliver.
Silly children,
said
Hezekiah, do not
raise
imaginary
miseries
to afflict
yourselves
with. If he was
so
mad as to
wish
to do
so
, he would not find any one
mad enough to carry him.
The
horses
were now at the door. Reuben handed
Miss
Oliver to her carriage, and then, accompanied by
Hezekiah, made all
possible
speed
to Liverpool;
whilst
aunt Rachel and her niece
passed
the night in
traversing
the apartment,
listening
to the
storm
, and
ejaculating
fervent prayers for the
preservation
of the
unhappy
sailors
,
whose
perils (they were
assured
by the
repeated
discharge
of guns)
still
continued. Neither
of them attempted to
rest
; they
spoke
but little, but
each in
silence
indulged her own melancholy thoughts.
Aunt Rachel had, added to the anxiety
she
felt for
her nephew's
safety
, a
presentiment
that,
should
any
thing happen to him, his children would be involved
in very
disagreeable
circumstances
. Mr. Dudley had
not
entrusted
her with the exact
situation
of his affairs
previous to his leaving England. He had told her
she
might draw on his agent, Atkins, for two hundred
pounds each year, and that Atkins had
also
orders to
pay for Reuben's education, and defray all his
expenses
;
but
she
knew that the
last
half year of
Reuben's
board remained unpaid, and
she
had
herself
received
a letter, recommending prudence to her, and
hinting,
should
Mr. Dudley extend his
stay
abroad
another
six
months, he, Atkins,
should
not be able to
supply
the money
necessary
for
house
-keeping.
This had
previously
given birth to many
uneasy
reflections
;
and now that
she
found he had drawn for
so
large a
sum
, and given Atkins unlimited power to
sell
or mortgage part of the
Lancashire
estate
,
she
feared
,
should
any fatal accident prevent his reaching
England, Reuben and Rachel might be
severe
sufferers
,
in more ways than the
loss
of a father.
For
herself
,
she
had no fears; and though the half
of that
estate
constituted
the whole of her worldly
possessions
,
yet
such
was the native philanthropy of her
mind,
so
little was
self
regarded, and with
such
enthusiasm
did
she
regard the offspring of her lamented
brother William, that to
supply
the
smallest
of their
wants,
she
would have cheerfully
divested
herself
of
even the common
necessaries
of life.
Aunt Rachel was now nearly approaching her
sixty-fifth
year; but temperance,
cheerfulness
, and a
decent
competence, joined to a
constitution
firm by
nature
,
had given even to this advanced period,
strength
of intellect, hilarity of
spirits
, and uncommon
personal
vigour.
In reflections like
those
just
mentioned on her part,
and
earnest
prayers for her father's
safety
and her
brother's return on the part of Rachel, was the
wearisome
night
passed
. Towards morning the
storm
abated
,
and the
sun
arose
in a clear, unclouded horizon;
but the ravages of the
tempest
were to be
seen
;
several
trees were lying on the ground, torn from their
roots by the violence of the wind. A barn had been
unroofed during the night, and the chimney of a
neighbouring
cottage blown down.
I wonder my brother don't return,
said
Rachel.
I
wish
he may bring us good news when he does
come, replied her aunt.
From the
rising
of the
sun
, till it
passed
the
meridian
,
Rachel
scarcely
for a moment quitted the window
that looked towards the road. At length, about three
o'clock,
she
saw
her brother
slowly
winding down the
hill.
Ah! my dear aunt, here comes Reuben, cried
she
.
But he comes not like the
messenger
of joy,
replied
aunt Rachel.
He is weary, aunt. The affectionate
sister
ran
to open the door, and receive her brother.
What news, my dear Reuben?
said
she
eagerly,
as he led her into the parlour.
The
vessel
is
lost
! he replied.
And the crew?
All
perished
.
Did you learn where
she
is
supposed
to be from?
said
aunt Rachel.
A pilot boat, that
passed
her
yesterday
morning,
brought intelligence
she
was from America, but not
what particular port.
Had they no pilot on board?
Yes, and he has
perished
with them.
The tears
started
into Renben's eyes as he
spoke
;
Rachel wept audibly. Their aunt took a hand from
each.
Weep not, my children,
said
she
, but
trust
in
God. If it has
pleased
him to deprive you of your
father, he is able to
supply
his place. Look up to
him, my children;
worship
him,
serve
him, obey him,
in
sincerity
of heart. He may of his infinite
wisdom
afflict; but remember, and let it fill your
souls
with
humble hope and comfort, that his
chastisements
are
but temporal, but his rewards to
those
who love him,
eternal.
Then you think we are orphans?
said
Rachel.
I think, replied her aunt, that it is more than
probable your father was in the
ship
which was
last
night
lost
.
Two days from this
passed
, and no certain
intelligence
could be procured. Sometimes they
encouraged
a dawn of hope, and then again
relapsed
into
despair
. Rachel was the
earliest
riser
in the family;
she
had been up above an hour when the
newspaper
was brought, as it was
customary
twice a week from
Liverpool. She took it from the
servant
, and as
she
held it to the fire to dry, the following paragraph met
her eyes.We are at length certain, that the
large
ship
which was
lost
on Monday night
last
,
endeavouring
to get into this harbour, was the Aurora,
of London, from Philadelphia. Two men, who
providentially
escaped
, brought the melancholy
intelligence
of the captain, mate, ten hands and fourteen
passengers
having
perished
;
amongst
the latter was
Mr. Reuben Dudley.
Rachel read no more. The paper fell from her
hands, and
sense
, feeling,
almost
life
itself
, was for a
while
suspended
. She
sunk
on the floor, her head
rested
on the elbow of her aunt's
easy
chair, her eyes
were open, but
she
was as devoid of
speech
and
motion
as a
statue
. In this
situation
her brother found
her. My
sister
! my dear Rachel! he exclaimed,
eagerly
raising
her. His voice recalled her fleeting
senses
. She threw her arms round his neck, faintly
articulated, Our father! our beloved father! and
nature relieved her
bursting
heart by a violent
gush
of tears.
Aunt Rachel was prepared for the intelligence;
her heart had
presaged
it from the
first
. She bore it
with the fortitude of a
Christian
, though
she
felt it as
acutely as her niece. But
she
had learnt to
repress
her feelings, and to bow with
resignation
to the will
of an all-wife Providence.
CHAP. V.
Soft as the
silver
dews that
rest
On flow'rs that
scent
the morning air;
So
soft
,
so
sweet
, to
sorrow
's
breast
,
Is
Friendship
's
smile
and Pity's tear.
It
may naturally be
supposed
, that when the heavy
misfortune Reuben and Rachel had
sustained
was
universally
known, condolements of form and
fashion
poured in upon them, and
some
few offered
consolation
with
sincerity
, and participated in their afflictions
with feelings truly philanthropic.
Amongst
the
latter
class
was
Miss
Oliver. She wass
so
sensibly
affected
by the
loss
they had experienced in the death of
their father, that nearly a week
elapsed
before
she
could
summon
fortitude
sufficient
to enable her to pay them a
visit
. At length, her
wish
to
administer
comfort
triumphed
over the fear
she
had entertained of the
anguish
she
must
necessarily
encounter in the interview.
She
arose
with a
resolution
of
passing
the day with
Rachel, took an early
breakfast
, and by nine o'clock
was at her habitation.
Anguish
of heart had
so
enervated the mental
faculties
of our heroine, that
she
no longer
arose
with the
lark,
sought
employment with avidity, or
pursued
it
with alacrity. Why
should
I work?
she
would
say
; I have no expectation now to cheer me; no
fond hope of a returning father's
smiles
and
approbation
rewarding my labours. Her mind occupied by
reflections
such
as
these
, Rachel gave more hours to
her pillow than was her
usual
custom
; not that
she
found there the
rest
she
sought
; but there
she
could
weep
unrestrained
, there
she
could uninterruptedly
indulge
in contemplation. And if haply
sleep
for a few
hours
steeped
her
senses
in
forgetfulness
,
she
blessed
the
sweet
oblivion, and courted its return. She was
seated
at the
breakfast
table when
Miss
Oliver entered.
Jessy
!
said
the mournfully, and half
rising
to
present
her hand; but overcome by the
sensations
which
rushed
on her
soul
,
she
sunk
again on her
seat
.
Miss
Oliver took the proffered hand,
pressed
it
tenderly
,
seated
herself
beside
her, but was
silent
. Yet
her
speaking
eye met the glance of Rachel's; its
expression
conveyed more than was in the power of
words; it
said
, in the
most
intelligent language, Dear
Rachel, I feel, I participate your
sorrows
.
It was the
consolation
most
congenial to the
soul
it
meant to
address
. Rachel felt its
sincerity
, its
energy
,
and was relieved. Oh!
said
she
mentally, how
far preferable is this to the
profusion
of words, with
which the unfeeling attempt to
console
me. She
returned
the
pressure
of
Jessy
's hand; a few tears
escaped
from her eyes; Reuben
kissed
them off, and
seating
himself
opposite
the two charming young women,
contemplated them till his own eyes were
suffused
;
and the
suffusion
did honour to his heart, to nature,
to
reason
, to manhood!
How long this
silence
might have continued, is
uncertain
;
but it was abruptly interrupted by aunt
Rachel
,
who entered the apartment, followed by a
diminutive
figure habited in a grey coat, black
waistcoat
and breeches, an
immense
and not very
fashionable
peruke, high boots, a very deep pair of ruffles, and
a long neckcloth
twisted
through the fourth
button-hole
of his
waistcoat
.
This extraordinary
personage
appeared to be about
fifty years old. His black eyes, which were not the
less
penetrating for being extremely
small
, darted their
glances at the three
interesting
figures that
presented
themselves
in the
persons
of Reuben, Rachel, and
Miss
Oliver.
He bowed profoundly on entering. Rachel
rose
from her
seat
. Her
sorrows
seemed
to retire within
her heart, and a dignified
composure
took
possession
of
her features, as
she
received and returned his
compliments
.
This gentleman comes from Mr. Atkins,
said
aunt Rachel, as pointing to the
sofa
on which Reuben
had
sat
,
she
motioned for him to be
seated
. His
name, I
understand
, is
Allibi, at your
service
,
said
he, bowing again,
and recovering
himself
with an air of
consequence
; as
if he had
said
, I believe I am pretty
universally
known.
Mr. Dudley, I
presume
, turning toward Reuben,
and
Miss
Dadley, his charming
sister
, (bowing to
Rachel) if I may judge from your mourning habits.
Give me leave to condole with you on the
unfortunate
catastrophe
of our mutual friend. But man is
born to die;
so
regret is
useless
. Permit me,
therefore
,
to congratulate you on your
accession
to his
fortune
.
The mention of her father had called forth the
smothered
sensibility
of Rachel; but the
conclusion
repelled it by
rousing
her indignation.
Congratulate?
said
she
, in a voice
scarcely
articulate
.
Congratulate? echoed Reuben, and his fine
countenance glowed, his eyes darted
resentment
. Sir,
we are the children of Mr. Dudley, his natural
offspring
,
reared by his care, nurtured by his love, and
T
taught by his
wisdom
. Who then
shall
dare
insult
us? And he
rose
from his
seat
, laid one hand
on his
breast
, and with the other motioned as though
brandishing
a weapon. Who
shall
dare
insult
us by
congratulation for his death? Oh! my father!
My dear,
lost
father! repeated Rachel.
My afflicted friends,
said
Miss
Oliver,
softly
.
It was a
scene
so
new, the manners and
sentiments
of the young trio were
so
elevated, as to be
almost
unintelligible
to Allibi. He figetted on his
seat
,
hemmed
at
least
half a dozen times, and at length he
began
with
hesitation
I beg pardon. I
protest
I did not meanthat
is, I did not know. But as I was
saying
, young Mr.
Reuben Dudley, and his
sister
Miss
Rachel Dudley,
being twin brother and
sister
, and in the eye of the
law joint heirs of the
possessions
and
estates
, of what
kind
soever
, that is to
say
, of money, plate, jewels,
landed property,
houses
, merchandize, or what not,
belonging or appertaining to their late father, Reuben
Dudley,
deceased
Oh heavens!
said
Rachel, folding her hands
across
her
breast
, as if to accelerate her breathing,
which was evidently laboured.
My dear creature!
said
Miss
Oliver, in the
accent
of
commiseration
.
Good Sir, be expeditious in explaining the nature
of your
business
,
said
Reuben; and he walked to the
other end of the room to conceal his own emotions.
Allibi with the
same
sang
froid
proceeded.You
being, as I have before
said
, co-heirs, do thereby
stand
answerable
for all debts contracted by, or owing from
the
said
Reuben Dudley,
deceased
.
Granted,
said
Reuben,
hastily
. Pray come to
your
conclusion
.
The
conclusion
is,
said
Allibi, deliberately
drawing
forth his pocket-book, that you
must
of
consequence
pay this bill of five hundred pounds, which
your father drew previous to his leaving America, on
my client Andrew Atkins. Now he, Andrew Atkins,
having no property whatever in his hands wherewith
to
discharge
this demand, and being empowered by
your father before the late fatal
catastrophe
to
sell
,
mortgage, or
otherwise
dispose
of the
Lancashire
estate
,
in order to liquidate this and other debts he had
contracted, I am
sent
by him, my client, the
said
Andrew
Atkins, to inquire when it will be convenient
for you to
discharge
the bill; or in
case
of non-ability
on your part, I am empowered to take
possession
of
the
said
estates
on the part of my client, the
said
Andrew
Atkins, in order that he may mortgage,
sell
, or
otherwise
dispose
of it, to enable him to
answer
this
and other demands which may be made on him.
I
suppose
,
said
aunt Rachel, you know that
half the
estate
is mine.
Pardon me, madam,
said
the man of law, I
know no
such
thing. The late Mr. Reuben Dudley
inherited from his grandmother, the lady Arrabella
Ruthven, wife to Edward Dudley, who went to
America
in the year 1645; and as the
said
Reuben was the
only male
descendant
of the
said
Arrabella, and
she
dying
intestate
Sir,
said
Reuben
hastily
, the
estate
is half my
aunt's; we
wish
not to
contest
it. It is, it
must
be
her's, by all the rules of
justice
.
I know nothing of
justice
,
said
Allibi; the
law, the law, Sir, is my
profession
.
I thought, Sir, law and equity were
synonimous
terms.
You are a very young man, Mr. Dudley, very
young, very inexperienced; when you are older, you
will be
wiser
.
Reuben could not
answer
; a look of pointed
contempt
fully
expressed
his
sentiments
. Allibi continued:
And
so
, Sir,
yourself
and
sister
being minors, it is
necessary
to throw the
estate
into Chancery, when,
after
your father's debts are
discharged
, the
residue
will
be paid to you when of age.
And in the mean time how are we to live,
said
Rachel.
Oh! my dear young lady, you have friends,
wealthy relations. You have
also
youth, beauty, and
may command a home in twenty different families, and
in
so
doing confer a favour. Well, Mr. Dudley, I
presume
from your
silence
that you cannot pay
these
five hundred pounds?
Reuben bowed his head.
I imagined it would be
so
, and have brought down
people to take
possession
of the
house
, plate,
stock
,
farming
utensils
, &c. and
must
beg you will remove
as
soon
as may be convenient. With your leave,
(
rising
and putting on his hat) I will take an
inventory
of the family plate which I
saw
in the beaufet in
the next room.
He drew forth his pen, ink, and folded paper, and
without waiting for the leave he had
requested
,
walked
into the adjoining apartment.
Alas! alas! cried Rachel, whither
shall
we
go? Who will receive us? Where
shall
we find either
home or
support
?
Had I a home I could call my own,
said
Jessy
Oliver, you
should
not have
occasion
to repeat the
question
.
And poor aunt Rachel too, what will become of
her?
said
Rachel, tenderly taking her hand, which
hung
passively
over the arm of her chair, as
lost
in
painful thought
she
leaned her head
against
the
side
of it.
What will become of her?
said
Reuben with
energy, why I will labour to
support
you both.
Yes, continued he, fervently
clasping
his hands, and
dropping on his knees before them; yes, here in the
sight
of Heaven, I vow to dedicate my life to her and
you. I will cheerfully work to procure you
sustenance
.
Industry
shall
supply
our wants, innocence and
content
make our dwelling, however humble, the abode
of
pleasure
; and I will protect you from the
scorn
and
insults
of the world at the hazard of my life.
As Reuben
arose
and folded his
sister
in his arms,
Hezekiah Penn entered the room. He was
soon
informed
of their
disagreeable
situation
. But Hezekiah
knew
so
very little of the world and its concerns, that
he could not offer advice; all he could do was to bid
them cheer up, and hope for better times.
In truth, my dear
kinsman
,
said
he, I do
commiserate
your
sufferings
much; but I know not how,
young as you are, you can extricate
yourselves
from
your
present
difficulty. Come, then, home to my
house
; abide there till we can fix on
some
feasible
plan for your future well-doing. I am not
overcharged
with the good things of this world; but come and
partake of
such
as I have, and take with it a
hearty welcome. I pray thee, Rachel Dudley, be not
down hearted, but come to my
mansion
; bring
these
children with thee, and He who feedeth the young
ravens
will provide the means of
subsistence
.
The heart of Hezekiah overflowed with the milk
of human
kindness
; he meant all he
said
, and felt
more, much more, than he could find words to
express
.
His friendly offers, and the endearing
kindness
of
Miss
Oliver, healed the bleeding hearts of
Reuben
and Rachel, and even aunt Rachel was revived by
their influence. That very night they removed from
their own habitation to that of the benevolent
Hezekiah
,
and left the loquacious Mr. Allibi in full
possession
of the
premises
, in behalf of his client Mr.
Andrew
Atkins.
CHAP. VI.
Death of old Friend
Acquisition
of a Lover
Formality
personified
.
Soon
after this arrangement took place,
Miss
Oliver was recalled home. With many tears
she
took leave of our heroine, told her, if ever fortune
should
put it in her power to offer her an
asylum
,
she
might freely command her
purse
, her
house
, her
unbounded
friendship
in every particular. When
she
had again embraced Rachel,
she
turned towards
Reuben
.
T 2
Mr. Dudley,
said
she
, the
friendship
of a girl
like me is an offering of
so
trifling a nature, I hardly
know whether you will think it worth accepting. You
are
advised
by your friends to
visit
America, to look
after and
secure
the property your father
possessed
there. It will probably be many years before we meet
again; and what changes may take place during this
separation
, it is
impossible
now to determine. Accept
my
most
ardent
wishes
for your
prosperity
. I know
you will often write to my brother; in
those
letters
perhaps you will
sometimes
remember me.
Oh! doubt it not, charming
Miss
Oliver,
said
he,
pressing
her hand to his lips; while
she
, fearful
that
she
had
said
more than the exact line of
propriety
she
had
prescribed
to
herself
rendered allowable,
hurried to her carriage, to hide emotions
she
found
it
impossible
to
stifle
.
Atkins having now taken the management of the
estate
eutirely into his own hands, pretended to
advance
money
himself
for the liquidation of Mr.
Dudley's
debts, and at the end of three months laid before
Hezekiah Penn, Reuben and aunt Rachel, a
statement
of accounts, which, to the minds of
these
three
inexperienced
,
honest
children of
simplicity
, made it appear
as
so
involved, that it would be a long term of years
before it could even clear
itself
. In the mean time,
how were the orphans and their venerable relation to
be
supported
?
Letters were written to Jacob Holmes, a proper
time allowed, and no
answer
being returned,
Hezekiah
persuaded
Reuben, who was now nearly eighteen,
to
visit
that continent and make inquiry
himself
concerning
his father's effects.
Your
sister
,
said
Hezekiah,
shall
stay
with me
till you return. She
shall
not want a home nor a
father
whilst
I live.
A voyage to the
western
continent had ever been
the primary
wish
of Reuben's heart; he hoped he
knew not what, but that hope led him on; and even
to part with his
sister
was thought of with more
composure
,
since
, if he amended his own fortune,
she
was
to be the partaker of it.
Jessy
Oliver too was
foremost
in the happy group his
sanguine
imagination
portrayed
as eagerly flying to welcome his return to England.
Nay, fancy would
so
powerfully take
possession
of his
mind, that
she
would
sometimes
carry him a
second
time
across
the Atlantic ocean, and place him
tranquilly
in the habitation his father had
described
,
surround
him with a blooming offspring, and give them
Jessy
Oliver for a mother, his
sister
too heightening
by partaking their felicity; and even provide a
snug
corner and
easy
chair for aunt Rachel.
Uncle Hezekiah, he would
say
, will not be
persuaded
to quit Old England, or
else
what a charming
family party we
should
make.
Oh! how delightful are
those
day-dreams of youth;
like the
shadows
of a magic lantern, that
pass
before
the admiring eye in quick
succession
, each one as it
comes forward more
pleasing
than the
last
. But
sorrow
,
disappointment
, poverty, throw a damp upon the
fire of youth, which had given
brightness
to the
picture
;
the brilliant tints grow pale; the figures are
scarcely
perceptible; they
pass
before us
almost
unnoticed
;
when age entirely
extinguishes
the flame,
and all is
darkness
,
undistinguishable
chaos.
Spurred on by the native
impulse
of his mind, which
incited him to activity, and
inspired
him with the
most
sanguine
presentiments
of future
prosperity
, Reuben
took leave of his friends in
Lancashire
, and embarked
for Philadelphia.
Previous to his departure, he had thrown off both the
habit and manners of a Quaker. Hezekiah
remonstrated
,
but Reuben would reply, Nay, uncle, can
you believe it is of any
consequence
to our eternal
welfare, whether we wear a plain drab coat or a
scarlet
one? or do you not think I
should
commit more
sin
in continuing the habit, when I cannot
submit
to
the tenets of the Friendly
system
? I admire their
primitive manners, and the
simplicity
of their
language
;
but I am a young man, uncle, and have to
make my way through the world.
Besides
, I feel that
within me that tells me,
should
my king or country
require
my
assistance
, I
should
readily draw a
sword
in
their defence. What, my dear uncle, if we were all
men of peace, who would protect us from the
encroachments
of our enemies? No; you
shall
pray for
peace, and if the haughty foe is not inclined to grant
it, I will
assist
my brave countrymen to force them
to it.
Perhaps Hezekiah did not
say
so
much as he might
have done, had he not recollected that Reuben's father
had only become one of the
sect
in compliance with
the
wish
of his wife; and Hezekiah had charity enough
to think that a man might be a very good
Christian
,
though he wore a button to his hat, and ruffles to his
shirt
.
From the time of Mr. Dudley's unfortunate death,
aunt Rachel's
spirits
flagged. She was no longer the life
of every
society
in which
she
mixed. The
loss
of her
little independence, the being obliged to the hand of
charity for her daily bread,
depressed
her generous
mind. The
destitute
situation
too of her darlings,
Reuben and Rachel, was a heavy affliction.
Rest
and
appetite
forsook
her. Reuben's departure for
America
was the
finishing
blow. The anxiety
she
suffered
for his
safety
brought on a
slow
nervous fever, and
gradually undermined her
constitution
. Rachel
watched
over her with unremitting
tenderness
and
attention
;
administered
every medicine; read to her,
prayed
by her; endeavoured to cheer her by affected
serenity
when
she
was awake, and wept over her with
agony when
she
slept
.
But care, affection, prayers and tears were alike
ineffectual
.
Aunt Rachel departed this life, and our
heroine felt, as the
last
breath lingered on the lips of
her maternal friend, that in
losing
her
she
should
become
forlorn, unconnected, and be left to
struggle
through a world with which
she
was totally
unacquainted
,
without a comforter,
adviser
, or protector.
Reuben
still
lived, to be
sure
, but Reuben was far,
very far from her; and
should
she
stand
in need of
advice or protection,
she
might be
lost
, and Reuben
not even hear of her
distress
till
she
was
past
the reach
of relief or
assistance
.
Occupied by reflections
such
as
these
, Rachel would
often
strey
into the rural church-yard, where,
resting
on the lap of earth, lay the remains of her mother
and her lamented aunt.
It was
midsummer
. The days were extremely
long, and at half-
past
eight o'clock in the evening,
just
enough of the twilight remained, as threw over the
face of nature that
modest
,
dusky
veil,
so
congenial
to the contemplative mind. Rachel
seated
herself
on
the fragment of a broken tomb-
stone
, and
casting
her
eyes upon a new-made grave, where that very
afternoon
a youth had been interred, the only
son
of a
farmer in the neighbourhood,
she
,
almost
unknown to
herself
, audibly repeated the following
stanzas
.
Rest
, gentle youth, here
rest
in peace,
Secure from vanity and
noise
;
For here thy earthly
sorrows
cease
,
From hence commence thy heavenly joys.
Short was thy
span
; 'tis
past
! 'tis gone!
Early thou'
st
reach'd the appointed goal;
Freed from its clog, and upwards flown,
Angels receiv'd thy
spotless
soul
.
Here in thy quiet
mansion
rest
,
Safe from all
anguish
, pain or care;
Light fit the turf upon thy
breast
,
Nor weed nor briar
flourish
there.
And when the chilling arms of death
Shall
sold
this fragile frame of mine,
May my
last
sigh
of parting breath
Pass
tranquil and
resign
'd as thine.
My lovely
moralist
,
said
a voice, as Rachel
finished
the
last
sentence
, if you
sit
here much longer,
you will
stand
a chance of
soon
being as tranquil as
that poor youth. His
disorder
was a cold, and you
are taking the right method to catch one.
Rachel
rose
, turned her head, and beheld the
apothecary
of the village. Dr. Lenient was a man nearly
fifty years old, very humane, very learned, very
skilful
in his
profession
; but with regret it
must
be added,
not very rich. For if he attended a family
whose
wants were great and means
small
, when the
journeyman
inquired if he
should
make out the bill, as was
customary
, at
Christmas
, he would
say
, Pho, pho, tear
out the account and burn it; if I
send
it in, they can't
pay it. It is only my own time
lost
; and the few
drugswhat did they
cost
me? Nothing worth
talking
of. Oh! burn it! burn it! If the poor man has
got a trifle beforehand, why he wants it, in this
season
of hilarity, to provide a good large plumb-pudding
for his little ones.
With
sentiments
such
as
these
, though the Doctor's
practice daily
increased
, yet it did not greatly augment
his revenue. However, he
supported
his family with
comfort and
something
more than decency.
Our heroine was a great favourite with the good
man. Studious from her infancy, of an inquiring
genius, eager in the
pursuit
of knowledge, and
attentive
to the
conversation
of
those
who had the power
to impart it, Rachel at the age of twelve had
prefered
a
conversation
with the doctor, to a ride or a ramble
with her young companions. Charmed by her ardent
thirst
for
instruction
, the old gentleman would
answer
her
questions
, correct her errors, direct her
studies
,
and labour to give her an unaffected turn for
literature
and the polite arts.
When Rachel painted or worked flowers, the Doctor
would
assist
her in arranging her
shades
with
propriety
;
describing
, as he
sat
beside
her while
she
worked,
the natures, properties and
use
of every plant,
shrub
or flower. If
she
read, he corrected her pronunciation,
and taught her how to convey the full
sense
of what
she
read to her auditors, by a
pleasing
modulation of
voice. If
she
wrote, he would point out the errors in
her
style
, and often has been heard to
say
, It was a
great pity
she
could not
speak
and read Latin.
Come, my good girl,
said
he, you
shall
go home
with me. You are too melancholy of late, and
indulge
too much in
solitary
walks and gloomy
contemplations
.
And let me tell you, my young friend, you
are
insensibly
falling into an error, which, if indulged,
will
increase
and grow upon you, till it becomes
guilt.
Rachel
started
. What mean you, Sir?
said
she
.
I mean, replied the Doctor, that you are
sinking
into torpor and inactivity; you are
suffering
the
functions of your
soul
to be entirely locked up by
grief, and you are
distrusting
the power of a Divine
Providence, in giving way to immoderate affliction.
Alas! my dear Sir,
said
Rachel, have I not
cause
to be afflicted? am I not a
most
unhappy
creature
?
My parents dead, my brother at an
immense
distance
from me, my good uncle Hezekiah in a very
infirm
state
, and the only
source
from whence I could
look for
support
entangled in the law!
All this is true, I
must
allow,
said
the Doctor
gravely, but yet,
Miss
Dudley, you have a firm,
unalterable
friend, who has
said
, (and his word is truth
itself
) Though thy father and thy mother
forsake
thee, yet will not I
forsake
thee. And this friend,
my dear, has endowed you with wonderful
qualifications
of both mind and
person
; he has given you
good
sense
, genius, and the benefit of improving
those
qualities by education; and all he requires of you is,
not ungratefully to bury the talent
entrusted
to your
keeping, but exert
yourself
to improve it to the
utmost
,
depending on him to
second
your endeavours,
and he will amply reward your faith, patience and
industry
.
Cheered and comforted by
conversation
such
as this,
the melancholy cloud began to
disperse
from the brow
of Rachel. Her features
assumed
a
sweet
, an
interesting
composure
; and, arrived at the dwelling of the
good Doctor,
she
consented
to go in and partake of his
supper
. For the
house
of Hezekiah Penn was within
five minute's walk of the Doctor's, and a lad was
dispatched
to inform him that Rachel was
safe
, but would
sup
out.
This little
necessary
business
was
settled
in the
garden
that fronted the
house
, where the lad was
busied
in watering
some
pots of curious flowers; and the
Doctor then led his fair companion through the
shop
into a back parlour, where they
usually
sat
.
I have brought you a welcome
visitor
,
sister
,
said
he, as he opened the door. Mrs. Auberry
rose
from her
seat
, and taking the hand of Rachel, cried,
Welcome indeed. Then turning to an elegant
young man in military uniform,
she
continued, My
dear Hamden, give me leave to
present
you to
Miss
Dudley. This,
Miss
Dudley, is my
son
Hamden
Auberry
,
of whom you have often heard me
speak
.
The majectic figure, the
soft
, melancholy
countenance
of Rachel, rendered more
striking
by her deep
mourning habit, (for Rachel was not Quaker enough
to neglect that outward token of
respect
to the memory
of departed friends) made her appear in the eyes of
the young
soldier
almost
divine. She bowed her head,
and
presented
her hand with a grace peculiar to
herself
.
There was
something
in the action
nouvelle
, and
irresistibly
charming in the eyes of Hamden. He took
the
snowy
pledge of amity, and bowed low upon it;
and if his fingers did contract
closer
than the frigid
rules of
politeness
render
admissible
,
surprise
and
admiration
must
plead his
excuse
. Rachel was
sensible
of the
pressure
, and life's warm fluid,
rushing
impetuously
to her heart, from thence
sprang
to her cheeks,
and gave uncommon animation to her
expressive
countenance
.
Dr. Lenient was an old bachelor.
Himself
and
sister
were nearly of an age. She had, in her
youth, united
herself
to a young man, who, being a
younger
son
though of the united families of Hamden
and Auberry, had nothing but a
commission
and the
interest
of his father to depend on. Joanna Lenient
was poor in every thing,
save
personal
beauty and a
good heart. Young Auberry
saw
her, loved her, and
bidding defiance to every
suggestion
of prudence, in
direct
opposition
to the will of his father, married her.
His father renounced him, and he never
rose
above the
rank of captain. He
sought
preferment in the field of
action, fought bravely under the gallant Marlborough,
and fell in the memorable battle on the plains of
Bleinhem
.
His wife had never been acknowledged by his
family
,
and after his death
she
retired, with her infant
son
,
then only fifteen months old, to the village where her
brother
resided
. He had
just
entered upon the
busy
scenes
of life, had a
pleasant
house
, a
considerable
degree
of employment; but no
social
companion to
render
the
fireside
cheerful, or
preside
at the temperate
meal. He invited his
sister
to come and
increase
his
comforts by
sharing
them. She complied, and his
home from that hour became her's. Her
pension
was
devoted to the education of young Hamden, and the
supply
of her own pocket
expenses
; and the Doctor
found
himself
so
happy in her
sisterly
affection, her
economy in managing his family, her good humour,
sincerity
, and
study
to
please
, that every other woman
of his acquaintance
lost
something
in his opinion, when
compared with his
sister
Auberry.
It happened that when Hamden was about
seven
years old, the maid-
servant
of Dr. Lenient
requested
leave to go to a neighbouring fair, and take little
master
with her. Hamden joined his
solicitations
with
Susan
's, and was permitted to go. The brother of
Susan
was the head-waiter of an inn, in the town to
which they went, and thither the girl (after having
paraded through the fair with
some
of her companions,
and
purchased
for
Master
Auberry a gun and a drum)
repaired, in order to procure
some
refreshment
.
Hamden
,
satiated
with cakes, fruit and
sugar
-plumbs, left
her to take her
repast
in quiet,
whilst
, taking his little
musket
on his
shoulder
, and
slinging
his drum before
him, he paraded in the court before the front of the
house
,
supporting
his gun with his left hand, and
beating
the drum with his right.
Hamden was a remarkably
handsome
boy; his
complexion at once fair and florid, his eyes large and
expressive
, of the
finest
sapphire
hue, and his forehead
shaded
by innumerable ringlets of beautiful flaxen
hair; tall of his age, and
sufficiently
robust
to prevent
an appearance of effeminacy. Such a boy
so
employed
,
U
could not fail to attract notice. A lady, who in
passing
to her country-
seat
had
stopped
to take dinner
in this place, had
observed
his martial air and
step
, as
he marched before the windows, and throwing up the
sash
, called him to her.
So you have been to the fair, I
see
, my pretty
boy,
said
she
.
Yes, ma'am, and
Susan
gave me this gun; a'nt it
a pretty one? and the drum too; only hear how loud
I can beat it. She wanted to give me a fiddle and a
coach, but I
chose
the gun, and next fair I will have
a
sword
.
You
shall
have a
sword
now, my
sweet
boy; here
is a
shilling
to buy one.
No, thank you, ma'am,
said
Hamden; mamma
gave me money enough, and
she
would be angry if I
took any from
strangers
.
You are a charming fellow; will you go with
me?
If mamma
pleases
, and you will
promise
to make
me a
soldier
.
Why do you
wish
to be a
soldier
?
Because
papa was a
soldier
. He was killed at the
battle of Bleinhem, and I
should
like to know how to
fight, that I might kill the man that killed my father.
The lady felt her eyes fill with tears; the
undaunted
spirit
of the boy delighted her.
What is your name, my love?
said
she
.
Hamden Auberry, he replied; 'tis a great
name, my mamma
says
, and for the
sake
of my father's
relations I
must
be careful not to
disgrace
it, though
they never owned me, nor noticed me.
At the name of Auberry, the lady had
sunk
agitated
on the window-
seat
. Come into the room, my
dear,
said
she
. Hamden obeyed, and was
instantly
folded in her arms, while her tears bedewed his face,
as
she
tenderly
saluted
him.
It was lady Anne Auberry, the
eldest
sister
of
Hamden's
father. Struck by the innocent reproach his
natural and
spirited
replies had given, not only to
herself
,
but all the family, for their wilful neglect of
so
promising
a branch of it,
she
made inquiries
concerning
the
situation
of his mother, ordered her carriage,
took the child home, and from that moment adopted
him as her own
son
. At that period
she
was verging
upon forty, was
still
unmarried, and remained
so
at
the time Hamden, returned from a tour he had been
making on the continent, was introduced to our
heroine
.
Lady Anne had
spared
no
cost
in completing his
education. She never forgot the
promise
he had
innocently
extorted from her at the moment
she
first
conversed
with him, and before he was
sixteen
purchased
for him an
ensigncy
in a regiment upon the
home
establishment
. He was now only twenty-two,
but what cannot
interest
and money procure?
Hamden
Auberry, without once having been in actual
service
,
was advanced to the rank of Major.
When lady Anne thus
lavishly
poured upon her
nephew every advantage which wealth could
bestow
,
she
in her mind
purposed
making him her heir;
indeed
,
she
looked upon him as the heir of the family.
Her
eldest
brother's children were all puny beings,
and her
second
brother had never married. She
therefore looked forward with the hope of one day
seeing
Hamden one of the
first
men in the kingdom.
One of the preliminaries
she
had
settled
for his
advancement
was a marriage with
some
woman of
splendid
rank and fortune. Perhaps lady Anne was not
quite
so
anxious about beauty, grace, good
sense
, and
good humour, as Hamden
himself
thought was
absolutely
necessary
; for
she
had pointed out three
several
women of quality, who,
she
assured
him, would be
happy to receive his devoirs, and
whose
alliance would
do him infinite honour. But unfortunately one was
upwards of forty years old, another had a hump on
her back,
coarse
, unmeaning features, and a
disposition
that was the very counterpart of her form; and
the third, though formed by the
tenderest
care of
young love, yet
so
vacant,
so
totally devoid of
mental
endowments,
And when the beauteous idiot
spoke
,
Forth from her coral lips
such
nonsense
broke,
That Hamden, though an
enthusiast
in his
admiration
of female beauty, could
scarcely
command
patience
sufficient
to
listen
with an appearance of
common
civility.
His heart had remained untouched, and it was for
our heroine alone to call its tender
sentiments
into
action
.
The
artless
, unaffected manner of Rachel,
afforded
him the
most
delicate
pleasure
,
whilst
beholding
and
conversing
with her; for it was
so
apparent
in every word, look,
smile
of her's, that
she
was
unconscious
of her own charms, that
those
charms
became
the more
striking
, the more
fascinating
. About
half
past
ten, he waited on Rachel to the door of her
uncle's
mansion
, and then returned to tell his mother
she
was the only woman he had ever
seen
, who in the
least
appeared to him in every particular what a
woman
ought to be.
Hezekiah had been married very early in life, but
his wife lived only a few years; and from the time
of her
decease
, his
household
concerns had been
superintended
by a
distant
relation of his mother's,
whose
tall, thin figure, and
austere
visage
, attired in the
close
mob black hood, and other plain habiliments
usually
worn by the
sect
, looked, as much as it is
possible
to
conceive any thing to look, like formality
personified
.
Nor was her
dress
and
person
more
stiff
and
forbidding
than was her manners. Ignorant in the
highest
degree,
she
valued
herself
on that ignorance;
she
understood
nothing of polite literature; and whenever
she
saw
our heroine engaged in any book, whether of
instruction
or
amusement
it mattered not, by her they
were all termed vanity and vexation of
spirit
. The
productions of the
best
poets were called
blasphemy
.
History
was of no
use
; for of what
consequence
was
it to her what was done in the world before
she
was
born? And works of fancy, however excellent in
their kind, were all a pack of
nonsense
, and
served
only
to fill young people's heads with proclamations.
To be
seen
with a book on any day except Sunday,
was highly
against
her creed. For in her opinion
needle-work,
spinning
, and attending to the culinary
concerns of the family, were
sufficient
to occupy every
hour of the day. Her pickles and
preserves
were
excellent
in their kind, and for good
substantial
roast
and boiled
dishes
, with
solid
plumb-puddings, and large
family mince-pies, Tabitha would not give place to
any woman in England. Hezekiah thought, with all
her oddities,
she
had his
interest
sincerely
at heart, and
therefore continued
passive
, and
suffered
Tabitha to
rule the family as
she
pleased
. But the maidens of
the
household
unanimously
declared, that
she
ruled
with a rod of iron.
CHAP. VII.
Journey to London.
When
Hamden Auberry had
seen
Rachel to
her uncle's door and rapped at it,
politeness
obliged him to wait till it was opened, which it was
by Tabitha
herself
. She glanced her eye at the
scarlet
coat and the lace which decorated it, nor did
she
entirely overlook the
handsome
form and face of him
who wore it. But when, without noticing Tabitha,
Hamden bowed to our heroine, and
kissing
her hand
with an air of gallantry,
wished
her a good night,
she
became troubled in
spirit
that Rachel
should
have
submitted
to
such
an abomination quietly.
With upright head, her long,
scraggy
neck
stretching
to its
utmost
extent, from a
consciousness
of her
own purity, in
silent
solemnity
Tabitha
stalked
into the
parlour, where
sat
Hezekiah
almost
dozing in his
easy
chair. She
deposited
the candle on the table, and
seated
herself
on his right hand. Rachel
sat
down on
the other,
side
, and affectionately bending over the
chair,
asked
her uncle how he was.
U 2
Why tired
almost
to death, thou
mayest
be
sure
,
said
Tabitha, not giving Hezekiah time to reply.
Then it was a pity my uncle did not go to bed,
said
Rachel innocently.
Thou art both an unthinking and an unfeeling
girl, Rachel Dudley,
else
wouldest
thou know that
anxiety for thy
safety
kept him up. But he has had
so
many of
those
uneasy
hours
since
thou
hast
been in
his dwelling, that I can
foresee
it will hurry him to
his grave. Oh! Rachel! Rachel! thou art turned
to vanity, to folly, to abomination. Thou art
wilfully
running into the
snares
of the wicked one. Thou
dost
love to
consort
with the children of
disobedience
;
thou
delightest
to behold their
vestments
,
shining
with
gold, and red in the blood of Jezebel.
Bless
me,
said
Rachel, what can you mean?
Uncle, pray
speak
to me. I hope I have not given
you any
cause
for
uneasiness
. I
sent
word that I
should
sup
at Dr. Lenient's; had you
sent
by the boy for me
to come home, I
should
have returned
instantly
.
Hezekiah had taken her hand, which in her
earnestness
she
had laid on his knee, gave it a gentle
pressure
, and was beginning to
speak
; but Tabitha
interrupted
him, and he knew it would be in vain to
attempt
being heard, when
she
was inclined to talk.
So he
relinquished
his intention, leaned back in his
chair,
shut
his eyes, and inwardly
wished
he could
shut
his ears
also
.
Thou
didst
send
word, it is true,
said
the
persecuting
Tabitha, but thou
didst
not
send
word that a
stranger
would walk with thee; that thou
wouldest
lean on his arm, and
suffer
him to
kiss
thy hand, in a
manner not becoming a maiden who
wisheth
to
preserve
her reputation. And this
stranger
was clothed
in
scarlet
and gold, and eats the bread that is
purchased
by murdering his fellow-creatures. Verily, I
say
, my
spirit
waxeth wroth when I think the
daughter
of
Cassiah
Penn turneth from the
worship
of her
father's
house
, and runneth after
strange
gods, and
delighteth to dwell in the tents of idolaters.
I beg your pardon,
said
Rachel tartly; my
father
despised
both formality and
hypocrisy
.
Oh thou offspring of a generation of vipers, cried
Tabitha,
dost
thou call our pure and undefiled faith
hypocrisy
?
No! Heaven forbid I
should
, replied our
heroine
mildly; it is only the uncharitable and
insensate
wretch, who, having neither heart to conceive,
nor
understanding
to enjoy, the innocent
pleasures
with which a bountiful Creator has enriched the world,
proudly arrogate to
themselves
the right to judge
and contemn their fellow-creatures; and
surely
it is
the height of
hypocrisy
to pretend to
deserve
the
divine
appellation of
Christian
, and yet harbour in the
bosom
envy, hatred and malice.
Rachel! Rachel! child of folly, daughter of
disobedience
,
exclaimed Tabitha
vociferously
, her
meagre
features flaming with rage, as though the fire
within
shone
through her
skinny
cheeks and hollow
eyes; child of
darkness
, hear me; thou art going
blindfold into the pit; thou art walking barefoot over
burning
ploughshares
; but the
soles
of thy feet, like
thine eternal
soul
, is callous and
insensible
to the
danger
that
surrounds
thee. Had thy mother lived unto
this day
Oh! would to Heaven
she
had! cried Rachel,
her
spirits
no longer able to
support
her
against
the
absurd
accusations
of Tabitha. Oh that
she
were
alive at this moment;
she
would not
suffer
her
innocent
child to be thus
grossly
insulted
.
Here
she
gave way to an involuntary
gush
of tears;
but
suppressing
them as quick as
she
could,
she
kissed
her uncle with affection, Good-night! God
bless
you, my dear Sir,
said
she
; the unhappy Rachel
will not long be a trouble to you.
God
bless
you, my love,
said
Hezekiah, and
grant us both patience according to the burthens it
may
please
him to lay upon us.
Amen,
said
Rachel
servently
, darting an
indignant
look at Tabitha; then
rising
and taking the
candle
from the table,
she
went towards the door; but
the natural philanthropy of her mind would not
suffer
her to part in enmity with any one. She turned
towards
Tabitha. Good-night,
said
she
in a
softened
accent, and Heaven forgive us both as we forgive each
other. Tabitha was
sullenly
silent
, and Rachel
retired
to her
solitary
apartment, wept a few moments,
knelt, and commended
herself
to the protection of
Heaven; was
composed
and comforted by the action,
retired to bed, and
sunk
into the arms of
repose
.
Sweet, heavenly
sweet
, are the
slumbers
of the
innocent
.
Rachel's heart was uncontaminated; envy,
hatred,
jealousy
, were equal
strangers
to it. Her
sleep
was
undisturbed
and
refreshing
; her dreams the
visitation
of
ministering
angels.
When Rachel left the parlour, Tabitha began
speaking
to Hezekiah, but he
arose
from his
seat
. My
head aches,
said
he, I can
sit
up no longer. Then
taking his own candle, which
stood
ready on the
table
,
he bade Tabby good-night and retired to his
apartment.
I will alter my will to-morrow,
said
Hezekiah,
as he laid his head on the pillow; (for,
some
years
previous to the death of Mr. Dudley, this will had
been made highly in Tabitha's favour) I will alter
my will,
said
he, it will not be right to leave my
fair and good
kinswoman
Rachel, dependent on a
person
whose
understanding
is weak, and
whose
heart is
contracted.
In the morning he
arose
with the
same
determination
,
and
dispatched
a
person
for the
most
eminent
attorney of the neighbouring market town. He
walked
himself
to Dr. Lenient's,
wishing
to
consult
with
him, and to have him a
witness
to his new will. But
unfortunately the attorney was gone to London on
particular
business
, and Dr. Lenient had been called to
Liverpool to
visit
a patient, who, having found benefit
from his
prescriptions
whilst
on a
visit
in the country,
wished
to have
those
prescriptions
continued.
At dinner, Hezekiah ate
less
than
usual
,
complained
of an acute pain
across
his temples, and a
coldness
down the
spine
of his back.
Why
dost
thou not partake of that boiled
soal
?
said
Tabitha; the
shrimp
sauce
is good, I can
assure
thee, for I made it
myself
.
I have no appetite for
fish
, he replied,
pushing
the plate gently from him.
Let me change your plate, dear uncle,
said
Rachel
,
removing the one before him and
setting
one in
its place on which
she
had
previously
laid the wing of
a chicken.
Hezekiah drew the plate towards him, cut a
mouthful
and
raised
it to his lips. But the effort was vain;
his countenance changed; he
sunk
back. It was a
kind of paralytic affection. He
struggled
to
speak
,
but could not articulate. By the order of Tabitha,
he was put into a warm bed, and Dr. Lenient being
just
returned, attended on the
first
summons
. He
ordered
the
usual
applications, and waited to
observe
their effects. All the night he continued
speechless
;
but towards morning, by a violent exertion, he
spoke
so
as to be
understood
.
Desiring
to be
raised
in the
bed, he in faltering accents thus began:
I called on you, my good friend, this morning,
to
ask
your advice and opinion.
I
wish
I had been at home,
said
the Doctor,
we might perhaps have prevented this
severe
attack.
That is not my meaning,
said
Hezekiah. My
time is come, and,
skilful
as you are, my good
Doctor
,
I do not think you can ward off the
stroke
of
death.
I do not think I could,
said
the Doctor gravely.
Tabitha,
said
the
sick
man, reaching out his hand
towards her, I am much indebted to you for the
unwearied
attention you have for many years
shewn
me,
and the care you have taken of my temporal
interest
.
It has grieved me to
see
the little
dissensions
which
have of late taken place between you and my niece
Rachel, who, though younger, livelier, more free from
prejudice than
yourself
, is
nevertheless
one of the
best
and
most
unoffending creatures in the world. Let
me
see
you friends, continued he, taking Rachel's
hand and joining it with Tabitha's.
Rachel could not
speak
, Tabitha would not, and
Hezekiah continued:
You will find on the opening of my will, Dr.
Lenient, that I have not forgot the
services
I have
received
from my ancient
kinswoman
; but I am
sorry
I meant to alterI
wish
her to give His voice
again faulteredto give her
said
he with
extreme
difficulty.
Fifty or
sixty
guineas, cried Tabitha,
interrupting
him.
No, exclaimed the dying man; then
struggling
violently, he at length articulated, Give her half.
They were his
last
words. In a few moments he
sunk
again into
insensibility
, and before evening expired.
Now the good-hearted Doctor fully comprehended
what Hezekiah meant when he
said
, Give her half.
But Tabitha wilfully
misconstrued
the
expression
; and
when the will was read, which gave the
house
, land,
cattle, plate, furniture, &c. to Tabitha
Holdfast
, in
consideration
of her more than
sisterly
kindness
, Dr.
Lenient intimating, that he expected
she
would make a
fair and equitable
division
of the whole with Rachel, in
compliance with what he
understood
to be the intention
of the
testator
from his
last
words,
she
calmly replied.
Friend Lenient, I am not accountable for what
thou
mayest
have
understood
. I am certain our dear
departed brother Hezekiah And here the
handkerchief
visited
her eyes; but it returned
Dry as the chaff, which, flitting in the wind,
Too light to be
depress
'd by trifling
showers
,
Defies the
blast
, and flutters o'er the heath;
Or, like the downy plumage of the
swan
,
White and
unsullied
.
I am certain,
she
continued, he meant not the
participation
thou
wouldest
insinuate
; for when (ever
eager
to interpret and prevent his
wishes
) I mentioned
giving her fifty or
sixty
guineas, he
said
, Give her
half; and by his dying words I
shall
most
surely
abide.
He meant to
say
, cried the Doctor vehemently,
that you
should
give her half of all he died
possessed
of.
It may be to thy advantage, friend, (
said
she
sneeringly
)
to have his
last
will
so
understood
. The
singular
attentions of one of thy relatives to Rachel has
not
passed
unnoticed; and I think thy family is
remarkable
for promoting its own
interest
at the
expense
of others.
It was a reproach too pointed to be
misunderstood
;
but it
sprung
from a mind
so
debased
, that it was
beneath
notice. The Doctor took his hat, and
wished
Tabitha a good night. Rachel
arose
to light him to
the door.
My good, dear girl,
said
he, I would
sain
have
procured from this woman a
small
independence for
you; but it is in vain to flatter you with the idea. But
this give me leave to
say
, Should you not hear from
your brother, and your
residence
with dame Tabitha
becomes painful, I have a home. My
sister
and
myself
both
possess
hearts, which I thank God are not
yet quite
petrisied
. Saying which, he
shook
her
hand and left her.
Rachel
soon
perceived the full extent of her
unhappy
situation
. The morning after the interment of her
uncle, Tabitha paid her thirty guineas, and from that
moment
she
found that
she
was looked upon as an
intruder
in the family.
Rachel was not of a
spirit
to brook the cold hauteur
of Tabitha. Nor could
she
think of availing
herself
of
the kind offer of Dr. Lenient. For,
besides
that
she
shrunk
from the weight of obligation,
she
also
felt there
would be an impropriety in her
seeking
an
asylum
in
the family of Hamden Auberry. She was not
insensible
to his merit, nor had
she
listened
unmoved to the
expressions
of attachment that had
sometimes
accidentally
escaped
his lips. For Hamden knew he
should
have many
obstacles
to encounter,
should
he give way
to a
passion
for a woman in the
state
of life in which
fortune had placed Rachel. Lady Anne would never
be brought to approve of his allying
himself
to a
person
,
who had neither rank or wealth to recommend her.
Rachel
saw
the
struggle
of his mind, and, attributing
that to pride which was only the effect of caution,
resolved
never to intrude
herself
into a family which would
look upon her connexion as degrading to its principal
branch.
Having therefore formed a plan for her future
conduct
,
Rachel took an affectionate leave of the worthy
Doctor and his
sister
, and a very cool one of Tabitha,
and departed in the
stage
-coach for London,
resolving
to
consult
and
advise
with her friend Jeffy Oliver, in
regard to her executing the
scheme
she
had thought of
for her
subsistence
till
she
should
hear from Reuben.
Mrs. Auberry gave her a letter to a reputable family,
with whom
she
proposed
to board. Hamden was
absent
at the time of Rachel's departure on a
fishing
party, and on his return, his mother merely informed
him that
Miss
Dudley was gone to London; but
wishing
to put a
stop
to any further intimacy between
them,
she
did not mention with whom
she
would
reside
,
or how long her
stay
might probably be in the
metropolis
;
and as he was engaged to
pass
the autumn with
lady Anne in Scotland, he was not
so
inquisitive
as he
might
otherwise
have been.
Rachel got
safe
to the end of her journey without
meeting with any adventure on the road. But
unaccustomed
to travelling,
she
was greatly fatigued; and
when
she
entered the
busy
streets
of London, the
noise
,
confusion
and hurry made her head giddy; the
disagreeable
effluvia too, which
assailed
her olfactory herves
as
she
alighted from the coach in a very
close
lane in
the city, turned her extremely
sick
, and
she
would
have fallen, had not a
spruce
young man, who was
waiting for another coach to arrive, caught her by the
arm, and led her into the
house
, where a few drops and
water revived her, and
she
began to inquire for a
conveyance
in which
she
might proceed to her lodgings.
A hackney-coach was
sent
for, and while
she
waited
for it, the young man re-entered the parlour where
she
was
sitting
, introducing a middle-aged woman,
dressed
to the extremity of the
fashion
.
Walk in and
sit
down,
Miss
La Varone,
said
he,
I will order the negus immediately. Then
turning
to our heroine, he continued, And how do you
find
yourself
now, ma'am?
Much better, Sir, I thank you,
said
Rachel.
Have you been
sick
, ma'am?
said
Miss
La
Varone.
I am not
used
to travelling, and was rather faint
when I
first
alighted; but it was only fatigue, and the
air of London is not quite
so
pure as that I have been
accustomed
to from my infancy.
Oh dear me! I don't wonder, ma'am, if you
never
were in London before, that it made you
sick
.
Then this lane is
so
close
; and I
protest
it made me
as
sick
as could be. But pray, ma'am, to what part
of the town are you going? Perhaps one coach will
serve
us both.
Rachel looked at the direction in her memorandum
book, and
Miss
La Varone exclaimed, Well, as I'm
alive, we are both going to the
same
place. Mr.
Spriggins, this young lady is going to your aunt's.
Rachel knew but little of the world in general, and
less
of London than
almost
any other place; yet there
was a
something
within her, a kind of native rectitude,
that told her not to be too
easy
in agreeing to the
proposal
of the
strangers
who
said
they would all go to Mrs.
Webster
's together. Yet her
politeness
and
good-nature
was
such
, as would not
suffer
her to
repulse
them
rudely.
Besides
, there was
something
in the
appearance
of La Varone, however familiar her
address
had
been, that
prepossessed
her in her favour. She was a
small
, delicate woman; her pale countenance, the
features of which were extremely regular, was
ornamented
by an animated pair of black eyes, and long,
dark eye-
lashes
. Her
dress
, it is true, was in Rachel's
opinion rather too gay; but
she
was totally
unacquainted
with the
style
of
dress
that might be
fashionable
in London, and therefore
passed
this
circumstance
the more
easily
over.
W
Finding it
impossible
to
separate
herself
from her
new acquaintances,
she
contented
herself
with giving
the hackney-coachman particular
instructions
where
to carry her, and in
less
than half an hour found
herself
at Mrs.
Webster
's, in Dartmouth-
street
,
Westminster
.
Mr. Spriggins, (who was
shopman
to a
silk
mercer
in the vicinity of St. James's Park) boarded with
his aunt, and
Miss
La Varone occupied the
second
floor of the
house
.
Rachel begged an early cup of tea, and then retired
to the apartment prepared for her; where wearied
nature
was
refreshed
by
several
hours of profound
sleep
.
But the fatigue which had accelerated her
repose
,
gradually giving way to its effects, her
slumbers
became
lighter, and about three o'clock,
she
became
sensible
of the (to her)
unusual
noises
that
surrounded
her. The hollow voices of the watchmen, the
rattling
of coaches and carts, the riotous mirth of
intemperate
wretches of both
sexes
, who, under the black
veil of night, prowled through the
streets
in
search
of
prey; all together
struck
on the
astonished
ears of our
heroine, who, not immediately recollecting where
she
was,
sprang
out of bed, exclaiming, Heavens! what
is the matter? However, as Rachel was not
troubled with weak nerves, and had in general great
presence
of mind,
she
presently
grew collected,
remembered
she
was in London, returned to her bed, and
endeavoured
to obtain another
visit
from the
viit">visit
from the
leaden-winged
god. He
listened
, and was propitious to her
entreaties, and at eight o'clock the following morning
she
continued
still
locked in his embraces.
CHAP. VIII.
Visits
Curiosities
.
The
scene
of life into which Rachel had now
entered
was every way new to her. Her
intentions
in avoiding the family of Dr. Lenient on account
of young Auberry were laudable; but her open and
ingenuous nature,
fearless
of guile,
because
intending
none, was not competent to the
task
she
had
undertaken
.
Humane, generous, and credulous in the
extreme
,
she
felt that every human being had a claim
upon her affection; and willingly allowing that claim
to others,
she
readily believed every
profession
of
friendship
made to
herself
.
Mrs.
Webster
was a woman of moderate
understanding
,
devoid of knowledge, and with a very
small
share
of
curiosity
, and being a widow with
three girls, the
eldest
of which was but
sixteen
,
she
had to work extremely hard at her
business
, which
was that of a hoop-petticoat maker, to
support
her
family. From
such
a woman, Rachel had nothing
either to hope or apprehend. She enjoyed from the
effects of her care a very neat apartment, and regular
decent meals; but as to any idea of a companion, it
was entirely out of the
question
. The daughters were
young, and their minds totally uninformed; they
were of
consequence
unfit
society
for her. To whom
therefore could
she
look to enliven her
solitude
by
cheerful
conversation
?
Miss
La Varone had read a
great deal, though not in
most
instructive
authors.
She had a
considerable
degree of
superficial
knowledge
,
was chatty, good-humoured, and
studious
to
render
herself
agreeable. She became the
constant
companion
of Rachel, and was unfortunately the
most
improper
companion
she
could have
chosen
.
Miss
La Varone was the daughter of a
Swiss
valet,
who, having
saved
a
considerable
sum
of money in the
service
of a nobleman, and received a legacy at his
death, married the lady's maid, and opened a
perfumery
and toy-
shop
, in which he
succeeded
extremely
well;
especially
when his daughter grew old enough
to attend the
customers
, her pretty face and lively
manner acting as a
talisman
to draw young men of
fashion
thither.
But human
happiness
is futile! A fire broke out
in the neighbourhood, and their
house
was
consumed
amongst
a number of others, and as their property
was not
insured
, a few hours reduced them from a
state
of competence to
absolute
beggary. The old
man received a hurt, in endeavouring to
save
part of
his
stock
, which he did not long
survive
. The
mother
again went to
service
, and procured employment
for her daughter in the
same
family. The
eldest
son
of this family was
pleased
with her; offered her a
settlement
;
and at the age of eighteen, La Varone
quitted
the protection of her mother, to accept that of a
libertine. Her mother had perhaps a higher
sense
of
virtue than
persons
in her
situation
are in general
supposed
to
possess
. She
remonstrated
, entreated,
endeavoured
by every
possible
means to reclaim her;
but finding all equally ineffectual, renounced her.
And though
she
had, without murmuring, returned
to her original way of life, and
submitted
patiently to
the privation of
those
comforts
she
had many years
enjoyed
,
and which had been the fruits of her own
industry
,
yet
she
could not meet
shame
without
repining
.
Her child's
dishonour
sunk
deep into her heart,
and in a very
short
time put a period to her
existence
.
La Varone continued with her admirer till he
married
;
she
then removed from all her former
connexions
,
into the
house
where our heroine was now
become
an inmate. She had been an
easy
conquest
; her
settlement
was
consequently
not large. However,
she
kept up a genteel appearance, and frequently received
visits
from an elderly gentleman, a
cousin
, who was a
member of parliament. She
saw
but little company
besides
; but
she
would expatiate for an hour on the
charms of retirement;
so
her living
so
recluse
was not
surprising
. Her favourite
amusement
was a play, and
sometimes
little
excursions
in the country, where
she
would
stay
four or five days at a time.
The day after Rachel's arrival in London was
devoted
to
rest
.
Miss
La Varone was extremely
attentive
,
invited her to take tea in her apartment, where
Mr. Spriggins
also
attended, and the elder
Miss
Webster
.
Here they talked of the many
curiosities
to be
seen
in London.
Westminster
Abbey, St. Paul's
Cathedral
,
the Monument, the Tower, the Palace; all
which
Miss
La Varone
said
they
must
positively
visit
,
and the gentleman offered very politely to be their
gallant.
Rachel was not devoid of
curiosity
. She had come
up to the metropolis with the
best
resolutions
in the
world, and Mrs. Auberry, when
she
recommended
her to Mrs.
Webster
's to board, thought
she
had
rendered
her young friend a very acceptable piece of
service
.
But
she
never reflected, that twenty-five years
make a
most
amazing difference in the manners and
disposition
of a
person
,
especially
if in that period they
have
suffered
much affliction, and from narrow
circumstances
being unavoidably thrown into the
society
of people,
whose
educations having been
circumscribed
,
are often the
slaves
of contracted, low ideas and
illiberal
prejudices; and it frequently happens, that
those
who are obliged to work
incessantly
for the
support
of their families, being wholly occupied in the
hope of bettering their fortune, become inattentive to
appearances, and overlook actions, which earlier in
life would have
struck
them with horror. This was
literally the
case
with Mrs.
Webster
. The Mrs.
Webster
whom Mrs. Auberry knew
so
many years
since
,
and
she
to
whose
care
she
now recommended her
young friend, were as
opposite
in
person
, manner, and
way of thinking, as if it had not been the
same
, but
two
distinct
people.
The
second
morning, Rachel took a hackney-coach,
and drove to the
house
of Mr. Oliver, in the vicinity
of St. James's. She was
still
in mourning; a grey
tabby night-gown, with black cuffs and robins, a plain
lawn cap, apron, handkerchief, and ruffles, was the
dress
in which
she
prepared to
visit
her friend
Jessy
.
But a woman thus habited and in a hackney-coach
was not likely to challenge much attention from the
gay lackeys who waited in the hall of Mr. Oliver.
Is
Miss
Oliver at home, friend?
said
she
to the
footman who came to the door. A
surly
No!
was
all the
answer
she
received, and the man was again
shutting
the door.
W 2
Is
she
expected home
soon
?
said
she
, putting her
hand out to prevent it from
closing
.
I know nothing about it,
said
the fellow.
Rachel had
descended
from the carriage before the
coachman had knocked for admittance, and was
standing
on the upper
step
of a flight of
stone
stairs
which
led up on each
side
from the
street
. Her figure had
attracted the eyes of Archibald, who was at home at
this time, and
seated
in a front parlour window, killing
time with a political pamphlet. Hearing her voice at
the door, and
understanding
from the tone of the
servant's
voice that he was not
answering
in a very civil
manner, he opened the parlour door
just
as
she
was
turning to
descend
the
steps
.
You were inquiring for
Miss
Oliver, madam,
said
he;
she
is at
present
out of town, but I expect
to
see
her to-morrow. Who
shall
I tell her did her
the honour to call?
My name is Dudley,
said
Rachel.
Dudley! is it
possible
; the
sister
of my friend
Reuben
?
The
same
!
How happy I am,
Miss
Dudley! Give me leave
to wait on you to your place of
residence
. I
wish
to
ask
after your brother; I have
also
some
interesting
intelligence to communicate to you concerning my
sister
. He
said
this as he handed her to the coach.
Then calling for his hat, before Rachel could collect
herself
sufficiently
to
refuse
or accept his
proposal
, he
was
seated
in the carriage
beside
her, and inquired
where he
should
order it to be driven.
Perhaps, my dear
Miss
,
said
young Oliver as the
coach drove off, you may think it particular that I
did not
press
you to enter my father's
house
. But to
confess
a mortifying truth, neither
Jessy
nor
myself
are
allowed to take any more liberties there than we
should
be in the
house
of an entire
stranger
. My poor father
is ruled entirely by Mrs. Oliver, and his children have
but a
secondary
place in his affections.
Pray make no apologies, Mr. Oliver,
said
Rachel
,
having a little recovered from the flutter into
which his apparently odd conduct had thrown her;
apologies are quite
needless
. I had no
wish
to enter
the
house
except my dear
Jessy
had been an inmate of
it. But you
said
you had
some
interesting
intelligence
.
True, but before I enter on it, tell me, when did
you hear from your brother?
I have not received the
least
intelligence from him
since
he left England; and
sometimes
I fear
Rachel's eyes filled; her
bosom
heaved.
Oh do not fear,
said
Oliver,
respectfully
taking
her hand: Letters may
miscarry
; you will no doubt
hear
soon
. But apropos of
Jessy
; has
she
not written
to you lately? I
understood
you
corresponded
.
We did; but I have not received a letter from her
for nearly two months
past
.
Poor
Jessy
,
she
had nothing
pleasant
to employ
her pen, and
she
always had an
aversion
to
endeavouring
to lighten her own
sorrows
by
imposing
a recital of
them on the attention of others.
He then proceeded to inform her, that his
sister
had
unfortunately (as it proved) been
singled
out by a
nobleman
of elevated rank and
splendid
fortune, as the
person
with whom he
wished
to
share
those
advantages
.
He
solicited
her hand, was encouraged by both
Mr. and Mrs. Oliver, but
resolutely
rejected by
Jessy
herself
.
My father, continued he, who (as I mentioned
before) has no will but his wife's, has
sent
the poor
girl into the country, debarring her of all
society
, and
declaring
she
shall
stay
there till
she
accepts his
Lordship
;
and I, who know her
disposition
, think that
sentence
is tantamount to
saying
she
shall
stay
there as
long as
she
lives.
She is right to
persevere
in rejecting him,
said
Rachel, if
she
does not feel her heart
sufficiently
attached
to him to incline her to
share
his pains and
pleasures
through life. For of all the
miseries
that can
be endured by a human being,
sure
none can be
so
severe
as being obliged to
submit
to the whims and
caprices
(for we all have them) of a
person
to whom we
are perfectly indifferent.
Oliver gazed at her, as
she
thus, with unaffected
freedom, delivered her
sentiments
on a
subject
, which
the generality of
those
young women with whom he
was acquainted would have
blushed
only to have heard
mentioned. But Rachel was entirely free from
affectation
of every kind;
she
had no idea, but that a
woman might
speak
on the
subjects
of love and
marriage
,
without
simpering
,
blushing
, and fifty other
little
foolish
prettinesses
. Nor did
she
feel the
least
embarrassed
in
conversing
with a
person
of the
opposite
sex
; for it had never entered her head, that every
man who
saw
her
must
fall in love with her, or that
they could not
pass
an hour in her company without
entertaining her with
praises
of her wit and beauty, and
complaints of their own
hopeless
passion
.
When the coach therefore
stopped
, and Rachel
asked
him to walk in, he eagerly availed
himself
of the
invitation; and after
sitting
with her till
she
was
summoned
to dinner, left her,
impressed
with
so
high an
opinion of her
understanding
, that he thought her the
most
superior
woman he had ever known. She had
promised
to
entrust
him with a letter to her friend
Jessy
,
and he was determined to call for it
himself
, that
he might enjoy another half hour of her
society
. But
in this he was
disappointed
; for immediately after
dinner, Rachel wrote her letter, and leaving it with
Mrs.
Webster
in
case
it
should
be
sent
for before her
return,
she
took one of the little girls with her, and
walked to the
house
of Mr. Andrew Atkins, in
Lincoln's-Inn
,
hoping to hear
some
tidings of Reuben,
and
also
to inquire how long it would be before
she
might expect to receive any money on account of the
estate
in
Lancashire
.
Being
shewn
into a parlour, and having
sent
up her
name, the was
desired
to wait till Mr. Atkins had
dined
,
when he would wait on her immediately. In about
an hour, he appeared, accompanied by the identical
Mr. Allibi who had
visited
herself
and brother in the
country.
Rachel
rose
from her
seat
.
Servant,
Miss
,
said
Mr. Atkins,
slightly
bowing,
and without
asking
her to
resume
her
seat
. Pray
what may be your commands with me?
I
wish
to know whether you have had any
intelligence
from my brother
since
his departure from
England
.
Intelligence? No indeed! I wonder you
should
think of my hearing from him; his going to America
was a wild-
goose
scheme
. What does he expect to
get there?
He expects to take
possession
of his father's
estate
,
which he
purchased
in
Pennsylvania
.
Pshaw
!
pshaw
! Dudley made no
purchase
there
worth inquiring after. An uncultivated tract of land,
with a paltry
house
upon it, which my very good
friend and
correspondent
, Mr. Jacob Holmes, has
informed
me is entirely fallen down.
Jacob Holmes, did you
say
? cried Rachel in
breathless
agitation. Why that is the very man my
father mentions in his letter to have left in charge of
his
estate
. He was brought up in my father's
house
.
Can he advance
such
an untruth, when he
must
be
conscious
?
Come, come,
Miss
Dudley, don't
speak
against
Mr.
Holmes; he is a very worthy,
honest
man. Your
father lived in a very
expensive
style
in Philadelphia,
spent
a great deal of money, more a great deal than
he ought. Even the trifling
purchase
he did make of
land was not half paid for.
Sir! Sir! cried Rachel, waving her hand with
dignity, I
must
not hear the memory of my father
treated with
disrespect
. You may have been taught
to believe what you now
assert
; or, perhaps, (darting
an indignant look at him) your
profession
accustoms
you confidently to
assert
what you do not believe to be
true. Be that as it may, I
see
my brother and
myself
are two unprotected orphans. Here her cheeks
assumed
a pallid hue, her lips trembled, and
she
was
unable
to proceed; and though the unfeeling Atkins had
kept her
standing
while he
spoke
to her, her agitation
was now
so
great, that
she
was obliged to
sit
down, or
she
would have fallen.
As I would
wish
to
save
you the
unnecessary
trouble
of calling on me again, I have brought Mr. Allibi,
who fortunately was dining with me, to give you any
information you may require concerning the
Lancashire
business
.
I am
sorry
, my fair lady,
said
Allibi, that it is
not in my power to give you
such
information as you
may perhaps expect; but
so
many unexpected
demands
have been made, that I hardly think the
estate
will ever be able to recover
itself
. I have here (
drawing
a memorandum book from his pocket)
some
few
memorandums of the
state
of the affairs at
present
.
Whenever you
shall
require it,
Miss
Dudley, I will lay
a regular
statement
of the accounts before you, and
submit
the whole of our proceedings to your
investigation
.
Rachel felt that this
seeming
integrity was an
insult
to her
understanding
.
Assuming
, therefore, an
appearance
of fortitude that
she
was far from feeling,
she
exerted
herself
to
rise
from her
seat
.
Good Mr. Allibi,
said
she
, conveying as much
acrimony into her looks and manner, as it was
possible
for her voice and features to
express
, of what
service
will it be for me to examine or
investigate
those
accounts? Did you, or your
respectable
client, Mr.
Andrew Atkins, imagine me competent to the
task
,
you would never have
so
readily offered it. But I am
a womanan orphan; young, inexperienced,
unprotected
;
and even
supposing
I could
discover
errors,
who is there to
support
my
assertions
? I am poor,
and I can plainly perceive, you have inclination as
well as
reasons
for keeping me
so
. Oh that my
injured
brother were but here!
You
speak
pointedly,
Miss
Dudley,
said
Atkins.
I
speak
as I feel, replied Rachel.
But you are too warm, my fair lady,
said
Allibi.
Pardon me, cried Rachel, I do not think I am
warm enough. Oh! that I could find words
adequate
to the indignation of my
soul
! Do not
misunderstand
me; for
myself
I am but little concerned.
I have an innocent mind that can be humble when
required
,
and hands that are not
useless
. But my
brother
is in a
strange
land; for him I feel a
thousand
fears.
My father's memory has been traduced; on that
subject
,
my feelings are too powerful for utterance. If
my
rash
judgment wrongs you, gentlemen, Heaven
pardon the error. For I leave you in the full
persuasion
,
that on whichever
side
the wrong is, the great
Redresser
of injuries, the righteous Father of the
oppressed
,
will impartially judge between us. By his
sentence
we
must
abide, and to him in humble
confidence
I
submit
my
cause
.
As
she
finished
speaking
,
she
hurried out of the
house
, to prevent their being
witness
to emotions which
she
was unable longer to
suppress
; and
she
found
herself
in the
square
opposite
Newcastle
house
, before
she
was
sufficiently
collected to remember to what part of
the town
she
was going. Polly
Webster
, who had
shewn
her the way to Atkins's, had left her at the
door, as
she
had
some
errands to execute for her
mother
in the Strand. Our heroine had imagined
she
should
easily
find her way home again; but when
she
found
herself
in a place with which
she
was wholly
unacquainted
,
and endeavoured in vain to recover
recollection
sufficient
to guide her to the right road,
she
began
to be
uneasy
. She
wished
for a coach, but there was
not one came near her but what was
previously
occupied
.
She walked
straight
forward through a narrow
passage
, which
she
imagined
she
had
passed
through
before; it took her into High-Holborn. The throng
of people, the multitude of carriages, and appearance
of the
shops
, led her to think
she
was in the Strand;
and turning to the right hand,
she
pursued
her way,
expecting every moment to reach Charing-
Cross
. But
as
she
proceeded,
she
began to perceive the difference
of the
surrounding
objects, and became
seriously
alarmed
.
A heavy
shower
appeared threatening in the air,
and even at Holborn-Bars, Rachel could not procure
a coach. The lightning had for
some
time gleamed
in the horizon; the thunder which had rolled
distantly
now came nearer, and an
universal
war of elements
seemed
approaching. Rachel looked round with
increasing
apprehension
. The
tempest
now
burst
forth
at once; wind, thunder, hail, and
sheets
of liquid fire,
rendered the
scene
tremendous. To avoid the fury of
the
storm
, Rachel ran up an entry which led to a large
old-
fashioned
mansion
, and though not
easily
terrified,
the late incidents had
so
oppressed
her
spirits
, that
she
sat
down on the
steps
, and
burst
into an
hysterical
flood
of tears.
What is the matter, woman?
said
a man who
was coming from the
house
.
The brutal tone of this
address
, the ferocious
appearance
of the fellow that uttered it, was an additional
cause
of terror. She
rose
, endeavoured to
speak
, but
could not; and when
she
attempted to walk, her limbs
failed her, and
she
sunk
again upon the
step
.
Why,
mistress
, you have taken a little too much
cordial to-day,
said
the
same
man; but come, I'll
lead you down the
passage
, and then you
must
go on
as well as you can; for you can't
stay
here.
Rachel, though overcome with terror, was perfectly
sensible
. She heard the remark made on her apparent
helplessness
, endeavoured to repel the violence of her
emotions, and exert that fortitude of which
she
was
possessed
.
I merely came here for
shelter
from the
storm
,
said
she
; and if I could procure a coach
Well,
mistress
,
said
a dirty, ragged boy, if you
will give me a
shilling
, I will call you one.
Rachel readily agreed to the
proposal
, and was
putting
her hand to her pocket, when there was a cry in
the crowd that was now gathered, that a pick-pocket
was
amongst
them. A young naval officer
said
he
had
lost
his watch and
purse
. `Keep all in, keep all
in,' was the cry, and the throng
rushed
up the
passage
,
so
that Rachel found
herself
in an
instant
surrounded
by
a motley group of people, the chief part of which but
to have been obliged to
speak
to, would have filled her
at once with terror and
disgust
. But what were her
sensations
,
when, putting her hand again to her pocket,
she
found a
strange
purse
hanging partly out, and felt a
watch actually within it. Before
she
could
speak
, a
woman
seized
her arm, and holding her hand
so
that
she
could
not withdraw it,
she
cried that
she
had found the thief,
Rachel's
strength
and
spirits
now at once
forsook
her;
she
fetched a deep
sigh
, and fell
senseless
into the arms
of the
person
who had been robbed.
The poor creature is ill,
said
he;
stand
away,
ruffians, and let her have air. Then carrying her to
the entrance of the
passage
, he
pushed
back her hat,
and untied her cloak. Her extreme youth, her beauty,
the
neatness
of her apparel, all
conspired
to
prepossess
him in her favour.
Had you not better
send
for a
constable
?
said
the wretch who had pretended to detect her.
No,
said
the officer; I do not think
she
can be
guilty; or if
she
is, extreme
necessity
alone could have
driven her to
such
an expedient. How are you,
ma'am?
seeing
Rachel begin to revive.
She looked wildly round her, put her hand to her
head as though endeavouring to recollect why or how
she
came there. At length the
circumstances
recurring
to her memory,
she
looked
stedfastly
on the
officer
,
and then on her
accuser
.
You have been robbed, Sir,
said
she
, and your
property found in my
possession
. How it came there,
Heaven knows; but as I
stand
in the
sight
of Him
who rules the heavens, I do
protest
I am innocent.
The
solemnity
of the appeal, the
conscious
innocence
of her heart, which beamed from her eyes and
informed
every feature of her face, rendered the truth of her
assertion
indisputable
.
I do believe you,
said
the officer; but even had
I thought you guilty, what is the
insignificant
value of
these
trifles, when put in competition with the life of a
fellow-creature, whom
distress
urges to actions from
which the
soul
recoils.
X
The
storm
was by this time much abated, and
Rachel
having
sent
again to procure a coach, the officer
said
he would not leave her till he delivered her in
safety
to her friends. He was
standing
at the entrance
of the
passage
, holding the hand of our heroine, when
a
post
chariot, that was driving
hastily
through
Holborn
,
being for a moment impeded by a number of
carts and carriages,
stopped
directly
opposite
where
they
stood
. The
glass
was let down, and Rachel
saw
distinctly
Hamden Auberry,
seated
beside
an elderly
lady. She
also
was certain, that he both
saw
and
recognized
her. The blood for a moment
forsook
her
cheeks, and then returned with
impetuosity
, dying
them of the
deepest
crimson
. Scarcely was there time
to exchange the glance of recognition, before the
chariot moved forward again, and a hackney-coach
drawing up to the door,
she
stepped
into it, and,
accompanied
by her protector, drove towards
Dartmouth-street
.
On their arrival at Mrs.
Websters
, Rachel found the
family in great
consternation
at her long
absence
(for
Polly having returned without her, had been
dispatched
again by her mother, who
seared
Rachel might
lose
her way; and learning that
she
had been gone
some
time from Atkins's, had returned as quick as
she
could, in the hope of finding her
safe
at home).
Miss
La Varone welcomed her with tears of joy,
and Mrs.
Webster
said
she
was glad to
see
her
safe
.
Courtney, (the name of the young officer) without
particularly mentioning the
circumstances
,
said
she
had been
disagreeably
situated
, and he had been
fortunate
enough to be of
service
to her. But Rachel
would explain the whole; her new friend,
Miss
La
Varone,
sympathized
with her, trembled with terror,
glowed with indignation, or melted with gratitude,
as the recital proceeded; and in the end,
said
so
many
obliging things to Lieutenant Courtney, that he began
to think her more than agreeable; and overlooking
the charms of our heroine, which had nothing but
nature
and
simplicity
to recommend them, he was
powerfully
attracted by the artful lures thrown out by La
Varone.
The
situation
of Rachel, in regard to reputation,
was now as dangerous as it was
possible
; for
Courtney
claimed the privilege of
visiting
her; and
Archibald
Oliver, when he returned from the country,
and his
sister
, called to deliver the
answer
to the
letter
he had taken, and one
visit
led to another, till
scarcely
a day
elapsed
without his
passing
some
hours
in her company.
Rachel's intentions, when
she
first
came to London,
were to apprentice
herself
to
some
person
who
could
instruct
her in
some
laudable employment,
whereby
she
might render
herself
independent. For
in her opinion, the
person
who by the exertion of
any talent, or the
exercise
of
industry
, could
support
themselves
, was in every
sense
of the word as
independent
as they who inherited wealth or titles from their
ancestors
. But
these
praiseworthy
resolutions
were
from time to time put off, and her attention diverted
to other objects, till
she
began to perceive the
small
sum
of money
she
brought with her to London was
very
visibly
diminished
, and yet no plan put in
execution
,
by which it could be
replenished
. `I
must
do
something
to-morrow,'
said
Rachel every night as
she
laid her head on her pillow. But to-morrow came,
and La Varone had ever
some
new
scheme
of
pleasure
to
propose
. Juvenile
indiscretion
united with
curiosity
,
and a love of
amusement
, natural to youth, led
her on from one day to another, till the
last
ten pound
note was broken in upon.
Forbear, ye rigid, ye experienced matrons, to blame
our heroine; it is the particular
blessing
of youth to
be enabled to enjoy the
present
moment, forgetful of
the
past
, nor fearing the future. Then
censure
not
those
who eagerly gather the
roses
, unmindful of the
briars that
surround
them, or who, delighted with
their beauty and fragrance, forget, in the enjoyment
of their
sweets
, the pain they
suffered
in gathering them.
Jessy
Oliver had written to her, had endeavoured
to
advise
and comfort her; but
Jessy
stood
in need of
advice and comfort
herself
; and our heroine, though
conscious
that
she
was not acting exactly right, could
not
summon
resolution
sufficient
to combat
inclination
;
but one party of
pleasure
succeeded
another,
till
she
almost
lost
the
desire
of employment, or the
wish
for independence.
CHAP. IX.
Variety
Courtship
ElopementLetters.
When
Hamden Auberry
first
saw
Rachel at
the entrance of the
passage
in Holborn, he
hardly could
trust
his
senses
; but on letting down the
glass
and looking intently, he perceived it was no
illusion
,
but in reality the woman whom he had thought
the
most
faultless
, the
most
perfect of her
sex
. His
heart
shuddered
; he dared not
stop
the chariot in
which was his aunt, or he would have immediately
jumped out, and learnt from her own lips the
reason
of her being in
such
a place; but before he could form
any
plausible
pretext for quitting the carriage, it
moved
forward again with rapidity, and looking out of
the open window, he
saw
her go into the
hackney-coach
,
accompanied by Courtney.
If he at
first
had imagined Rachel had voluntarily
deviated from the path of rectitude, a moment's
serious
reflection made him reject the idea; and he began
to be
apprehensive
that her innocence and
inexperience
might have betrayed her into
society
and places,
not altogether proper for a woman of character.
But how could he
satisfy
himself
? Or
should
she
be
surrounded
with danger, how could he
discover
her? how
advise
, or, if
necessity
required, protect her?
Had he known where to find her, he would have
ventured
even to entreat his aunt to take her under her
protection; but he had not the
least
clue by which to
trace her place of
residence
. He thought of writing
to his mother, for information; but lady Anne
purposed
staying
in London but two days, and it was
impossible
to obtain an
answer
in that time. However,
he did write, mentioning what he had
seen
, and
requesting
to be informed under
whose
protection
Miss
Dudley
was, hinting that he feared it was not what it
ought to be, or
she
could never have been in the
situation
in which he
saw
her.
On the day appointed, he accompanied his aunt into
Scotland; where,
situated
on the fertile banks of the
Clyde, was an antique family
mansion
of lord
Montmorill
,
her elder brother.
Whilst
there, he received a
letter from his mother, which
slightly
mentioned that our
heroine was well, and that the
circumstance
he had
observed
,
proceeded from her
standing
up to avoid a
shower
.
She hurried over the
subject
as lightly as
possible
;
for
she
saw
the growing
passion
of Hamden, and
knowing from experience the implacable tempers of
the family,
wished
to
discourage
hopes which
she
saw
he entertained, though
against
his own better
reason
.
Rachel
herself
was far from being
easy
when
she
thought of the incident, on the
first
night after
seeing
.
Hamden; (for
she
seldom
was allowed a moment for
thought, except in the hours devoted to
rest
)
she
felt
a
pleasure
in reflecting he was in town. I can
see
him now,
said
she
, without incurring the illiberal
reproofs of Tabitha.
The heart of Rachel harboured not a
wish
or thought
but what might have been made public to the whole
world; and while
she
was
conscious
of its rectitude,
she
felt proudly
superior
to the little prejudices of vulgar
minds. She could not
understand
why
she
might not
converse
with or entertain a
friendship
for
persons
of
an
opposite
sex
, as well as with
those
of her own. She
therefore indulged the hope, that Hamden would
visit
her during his
stay
in London; but when day after
day
passed
on, and he did not appear,
she
again thought
pride had prompted the neglect, and calling all her
own
self
-
consequence
to her aid,
she
endeavoured to
think as little of him as he apparently thought of her.
Young Courtney, the officer who under
such
favourable
circumstances
was introduced to the reader
X 2
in the preceding chapter, was the only
son
of his
mother
,
and
she
was a widow. He had two
sisters
also
,
lovely, innocent and
helpless
; their father had been a
veteran
sailor
, commander of a
first
-rate man of war,
in defending which from the enemy he
lost
his life.
The
pension
of a captain's widow at that period was
very precarious, and at the
best
but trifling, to
maintain
three women who had been
accustomed
to
ease
and elegance.
Courtney gave them all the
assistance
in his power,
and had often thought he would never marry until
his
sisters
were
settled
in the world; and then if he
could meet with a woman who could and would
supply
their place in attention to his mother. But
unfortunately
,
a few days acquaintance with
Miss
La
Varone, made him waver in his
resolutions
. She
could
assume
any character
she
pleased
. She
discovered
that her
personal
charms had attracted the
inexperienced
sailor
. She
wished
to marry, that
she
might with
impunity launch into extravagancies, which at
present
the fear of a jail alone debarred her from.
La Varone, with a heart extremely depraved,
possessed
one virtue in an eminent degree. She was what
the world in general calls extremely
prudent
, careful
to
preserve
appearances, and where her own
personal
safety
or
interest
was concerned, cautious not to incur
the
smallest
degree of danger. By nature fond of
luxury,
show
, and
expensive
pleasures
,
she
had the art
to
seem
frugal, retired, and
studious
. She was
sensible
that at thirty years old, the
season
for
conquest
was
past
, and though
she
did not own to more than five
and twenty, and by particular attention to her
complexion
and
dress
, was not
suspected
to be more; yet
she
thought if
she
could
secure
a permanent
establishment
for
herself
before old age and neglect overtook
her, it would be the
wisest
step
she
could
possibly
take.
The name of Courtney was honourable, his
person
handsome
, his manners agreeable, and his family
unexceptionable
.
It was a
conquest
worth
some
pains.
La Varone artfully drew forth his
sentiments
in
regard
to the woman he might prefer for a wife, and
appeared the very character his warm imagination
and unadulterated heart had conceived as
most
charming
.
She
spoke
of his mother with
respectful
affection
,
of his
sisters
with all the
servour
of
enthusiastic
friendship
; but if he mentioned her
visiting
them
previous
to their marriage,
she
contrived to evade his
solicitation
;
yet with
such
modesty
, alleging
such
delicate
motives for her
resusal
, that
whilst
it
opposed
his
wishes
increased
his love.
Our heroine was equally with Courtney the dupe
of La Varone, and rejoiced in the affection that
subsisted
between them; looking forward to their union, as
a period that would at once
insure
their felicity, and
secure
to
herself
two
sincere
friends, in
whose
protection
she
should
feel
herself
perfectly
safe
till the
arrival
of her brother.
During this interval of time, Rachel was frequently
visited
by Archibald Oliver. He had at
first
beheld
her with admiration,
listened
to her with delight, and
every
ensuing
interview had heightened
those
sensations
to a degree which
almost
might be termed
adoration
.
But Archibald
possessed
not a doit
independent
of his father, and that father he knew was, by his
wife's extravagance, nearly ruined.
Though volatile in his temper, eccentric in his ideas,
and violent in his
passions
, young Oliver was
scrupulously
honourable; and he would have deemed it the
height of cruelty to engage the affections of a woman
he could not with prudence marry, or to marry her
when he could neither provide for her
support
, or for
those
helpless
innocents of which he might become the
father. And fearing to
forseit
the highly valued
privilege
of
visiting
her, he confined his feelings within his
own
bosom
. She loves me now, he would
say
,
like a brother;
shall
I then, by claiming more,
lose
even the affection I
possess
? No; I will adore her in
silence
, and pray that her felicity may be complete,
though at the
expense
of my own.
One morning he entered the parloun (where La
Varone and our heroine
usually
sat
at work) and
seating
himself
beside
the latter, told her he came to make
her a partaker of his own
uneasiness
. Our dear
Jessy
, continued he, has left her father's protection,
nor have we any idea whither the beloved fugitive is
fled. Here is a note
she
left for me;
inclosed
is a
letter
for you,
Miss
Dudley. The
persecutions
the
sweet
girl has lately undergone, I have concealed from you,
because
, as you could not alleviate them, I
wished
not
to make you participate. But
disguise
must
now be
at an end. This was to have been her wedding day;
but early in the morning it was
discovered
she
was not
in her apartment. The
confusion
this
discovery
occasioned
,
reached me as I was preparing, with a
desponding
heart, to accompany the devoted victim to the
altar
;
and as I was
rushing
out to inquire the
cause
(for
my mind foreboded
something
fatal) the girl who
usually
attended on
Jessy
, came into my
dressing
-room,
and in agitated
silence
put
these
papers into my hand,
retiring the
instant
she
delivered them. I
hastily
tore
my letter open; but it contained, as you will
see
,
nothing
satisfactory
. I learnt that a note had been
delivered
to my father, and
wishing
equally to avoid him,
Mrs. Oliver, and the
disappointed
bridegroom, I took
a coach and drove directly here. The letter to
Archibald
was as follows.
To
ARCHIBALD OLIVER,
Esq
.
WHEN the altar is decorated, the
priests
at hand,
and the knife is
raised
, that will terminate
existence
,
who can blame the poor victim devoted to
sacrifice
, if
it break the chain by which it is held,
asserts
the
privilege
of nature, and, bounding over the plain,
secures
at once both life and liberty? Brother, beloved
brother
,
they have prepared the altar, but the
destined
victim
will
escape
their
snares
.
Deliver the
inclosed
to the friend of my
soul
, Rachel
Dudley; if
she
contemn me, I will return a voluntary
sacrifice
. For
so
pure is her mind,
so
unprejudiced
her opinions,
soaring
so
far above the common herd,
that I would abide by her
decision
even in a
cause
of
life and death.
Dearest
Archibald, though I am driven to the
dreadful alternative of marrying the man I
despise
, or
quitting the paternal roof, do not you
forsake
our
father
.
I
solicit
, I conjure you, my brother, in the name
of our
sainted
mother,
forsake
not our only remaining
parent. I fear he will
soon
, very
soon
,
stand
in need
of a comforter. I will be
constant
in my inquiries
concerning his welfare, and whenever I find my
presence
necessary
to his peace or comfort, I will appear.
Any thing but truth I would have
sacrificed
for his
sake
. Could you
see
my heart at this moment, you
would pity the
anguish
I feel in bidding you adieu,
perhaps forever.
JESSY OLIVER.
Rachel wiped off the tear this letter had extorted,
and proceeded to
peruse
the one
addressed
to
herself
.
To
Miss
DUDLEY.
WILL my dear friend pardon me that I intrude
myself
upon her, and by explaining my
sorrows
, make
her a party in my concerns? I have
suffered
much
persecution
, dear Rachel,
since
we parted; and to
avoid
rushing
at once into guilt and
misery
, I have
taken a
step
for which the world will
censure
me. But
what is the world to me? Had I voluntarily
assumed
the
splendid
shackles
prepared for me, had I become a
titled wretch, and
promised
faith and truth to one
man,
whilst
every
wish
, every tender thought of my
heart was devoted to another, would the approving
smiles
of that misjudging world, the adulation it is ever
ready to pay to
splendor
and nobility, have
compensated
for the
sacrifice
I
should
have made of internal
peace, of
conscious
integrity? No.Admired,
courted
,
envied, I
should
still
have been
miserable
. The
baseness
of my conduct would be my daily reproach;
I
should
have
sought
to
banish
reflection by
dissipation
,
and who can tell where the career of guilt and folly
might have
stopped
?
I have endured both
stern
commands and
soft
entreaties
;
I have been
soothed
and threatened
alternately
.
That I might with more
security
follow the
plan I had
previously
adopted for my future conduct,
I pretended (Heaven pardon the deceit) to accept the
husband
my
dissolute
and ambitious mother-in-law had
provided for me, and to-morrow morning I am
expected
to put on the Hymeneal yoke, and become a
countess
. But before the appointed hour arrives, I
shall
be far, far out of the reach of their tyranny. Let
not my
sweet
friend,
whose
bosom
is the
sacred
temple
of purity,
sear
that I
shall
forget what is due to
myself
.
That I am
strongly
attached to a worthy youth,
I
seruple
not to
confess
; but he is a
stranger
to my
passion
, and in all human probability will ever remain
so
; for never will
Jessy
Oliver offer
herself
unsolicited
to the acceptance of any man. My affections are pure
as they are ardent; but the name of the object of them
shall
never
pass
my lips, or
escape
my pen. I fly from
proffered wealth and grandeur, to
obscurity
; even
from you, my dear Rachel, I will
seclude
myself
.
Were I happy or affluent, you
should
be my
chosen
companion, the partner of my heart. But I am the
reverse
, and will
suffer
alone. If you will
condescend
to receive and
answer
the letters of a fugitive, I have
formed a plan by which we may regularly
correspond
;
but do not flatter
yourself
that by that means you can
trace me; nor do not, I entreat you,
suffer
my brother
to know the means by which my letters are conveyed.
And now, my
dearest
Rachel, adieu! Fear not for
me. I will never
dishonour
the name of my father,
or forget the virtue of my
sainted
mother. Perhaps
(my heart
sinks
at the idea, but perhaps) I
shall
never
see
you again. If
so
, may Heaven
shower
its
choicest
blessings
on you, and
inspire
me
with patience and
fortitude
to
submit
, without repining, to an affliction
which would lacerate the heart of
JESSY OLIVER.
When Rachel had
finished
this letter,
she
imparted
to Archibald as much of the contents as
she
thought
necessary
; but to all his entreaties of being permitted
to
peruse
it
she
continued inexorable. She admired
the
resolution
of
Jessy
, and had
so
good an opinion of
her heart and
understanding
, that
she
felt confident of
her
strict
adherence to truth and rectitude.
In all their
past
hours of friendly confidence,
Miss
Oliver had never
suffered
a
syllable
to
escape
her lips
by which Rachel could
guess
at her partiality to
Reuben
;
and at the time when they were
most
together,
our heroine was too inexperienced to
discover
the
passion
of her friend by looks and
gestures
. Perhaps,
had
she
conversed
much with
Jessy
after her own
acquaintance
with Hamden Auberry,
she
might have
been more clear-
sighted
.
Soon after this
circumstance
, young Oliver, weary
of home,
dissatisfied
with
himself
, and more than ever
in love with Rachel, felt there was a
necessity
for
tearing
himself
from her
society
.
Besides
, he hoped, in
travelling through the northern counties of England,
to be enabled to learn
some
tidings of his
sister
. A
distant
relation of his mother's
resided
in the beautiful
little town of Alnwick, in Northumberland; thither
he repaired on a
visit
. Its romantic
situation
pleased
him; the
society
of
several
agreeable families in its
vicinity delighted him; and if we add that a lovely
and
interesting
woman,
whose
fortune was large and
independent, beheld him with affection, and
suffered
that affection to become
manifest
, it is to be hoped the
fair reader will not blame him, if he lengthened his
stay
at Alnwick, and every day thought
less
and
less
of Rachel.
After the marriage of Lieutenant Courtney with
Miss
La Varone, our heroine felt
somewhat
disappointed
that
she
had not been
pressed
to accompany
the new Mrs. Courtney into the country. The
Lieutenant
had, to be
sure
,
solicited
her company; but the
bride did not, even by a
single
monosyllable
,
second
those
solicitations
;
so
Rachel
saw
them depart,
fervently
wished
them hourly
increase
of felicity, and
then
sat
down to reflect on her own
situation
in
London
,
without friends, without employment, and with
only eight guineas in her pocket.
I have done wrong, (
said
she
mentally) very
wrong. I
must
take more care,
must
endeavour to
be more prudent for the future.
As
she
ruminated on the
past
, felt no
satisfaction
in
the
present
, and looked with fear and
despondency
toward
the future,
she
heard a
confusion
in the adjoining
apartment, and the voice of Polly
Webster
, who was
her favourite, entreating a woman to have patience,
who by her
expressions
and manner
seemed
a total
stranger
to that virtue. She opened the door, and
learnt that Mrs.
Webster
was indebted to this woman
for tea,
sugar
, &c. (for
she
kept a chandler's
shop
in
the neighbourhood) nearly five pounds.
Now five pounds, to a
person
in abject
circumstances
,
is a debt of as much
consequence
as five
thousand
would be to one who keeps high company, a carriage,
horses
,
servants
,
dresses
gay, and, as it is generally
termed, lives in
style
; nay, perhaps, ten times more.
For the poor being, who for the
absolute
necessaries
of life has incurred a
small
debt, may be dragged by
a
remorseless
creditor to die in a
prison
, unknown,
unpitied
;
while he who, to indulge in luxury and
superfluity
,
had deceived the expectations of
honest
industry
,
deprived the laborious mechanic of his due, or
duped the unwary
tradesman
, is
suffered
to proceed
with impunity. Nay, even
those
who criminate his
conduct, will flatter his vices, eat at his table, take
him by the hand, and
smile
in his face,
whilst
in their
hearts they laugh at his
absurdity
, pity his
weakness
,
or condemn his depravity. Not but there are
those
,
who,
discriminating
between the
embarrassments
of
necessity
, and
those
of wilful extravagance, pity the
one and
despise
and execrate the other. Yes, there are in
this world hearts to
commiserate
misfortune,
whilst
they
dictate to the tongue comfort, and to the hands relief
to the
sufferer
. And
those
chosen
,
those
superlatively
happy few,
must
surely
be the favourites of Heaven.
For the
blessing
they delight to confer on others, will
return a
thousand
-fold into their own
bosoms
.
But I
digress
. To return to Mrs.
Webster
: She
could not pay the demand, and was threatened with
the law. Rachel had but eight guineas; but
she
could pay this demand and have three left. She
stayed
not to inquire what was prudent;
she
felt what
would be humane. She followed the heavenly
precept
of doing as
she
would be done by;
she
paid
the money.
The heart of Mrs.
Webster
dilated with gratitude;
and the pain Rachel had endured from the departure
and
coldness
of Mrs. Courtney, was forgot in the
transport
of the
present
moment;
so
true is it, that real
happiness
must
be the
result
of the knowledge and
practice of virtue.
Mr. Spriggins, the nephew of Mrs.
Webster
, though
awed by her
superior
sense
and the dignity of her
manner
,
was an ardent admirer of our heroine; but he had
never yet breathed a word that could lead her to
suspect
his
passion
. La Varone, young Oliver, and
Lieutenant
Courtney, had contributed to
impose
silence
on
him, and keep him at a
distance
. But now they were
gone, he could offer any civility to her without the
fear of having his endeavours to
please
entirely
frustrated
,
by
officiousness
or rivalry.
The
second
day after their departure, he came, and
requested
the
Miss
Websters
and Rachel would
accompany
him to the play. He
foresaw
that the young
ladies would not be permitted to go without
Miss
Dudley
,
and
also
that her good-nature would not
suffer
her to decline his invitation, as by
so
doing
she
would
deprive the juvenile party of a rational and (to them)
rare
amusement
. His expectations were realized;
and at an early hour they were all at the pit door of
Drury-Lane Theatre. The performance was a
tragedy
and pantomime, both excellent in their kind.
Rachel,
whose
sensibility
often
usurped
dominion
over her rational faculties,
banishing
the milder reign of
reason
, was, during the tragedy,
so
entirely
absorbed
by the
sufferings
of the hero and heroine, that the
splendid
circle that
surrounded
her in the boxes was totally
unnoticed. But between the play and entertainment,
she
looked round on the glittering throng; and in the
stage
-box,
conversing
with attentive
carnestness
with
Y
an elegant and very young lady,
she
saw
Hamden
Auberry.
The lady laid her hand on his
shoulder
. Rachel
discovered
that her
seat
was uncomfortable.
Hamden
,
as he
conversed
,
twisted
a curl of her luxuriant
auburn
tresses
round his fingers.
I declare I am out of patience, cried Rachel.
At what, ma'am? cried the officious Mr.
Spriggins
.
At the players,
said
she
; they are
so
tedious.
Yes, ma'am, replied Spriggins, they are to be
sure
a long while.
At that moment Hamden had taken the hand of
his fair companion and
pressed
it to his lips.
I cannot endure it any longer, cried Rachel,
the pit is
so
crowded, and it is
so
hot. Rachel
was not
easily
overcome; but her heart was more
attached
to Hamden Auberry than
she
was aware of.
It is
so
oppressive
, repeated
she
, unwilling to
acknowledge
even to
herself
the
cause
of her
uneasy
sensations
.
I
must
really quit the
house
,
said
she
,
gasping
for breath. And then, before any effort could
be made to get her through the crowd, a
sudden
mist
came over her eyes, and
she
fainted.
The young
Websters
were frightened, and Spriggins
was entirely occupied in
supporting
her,
so
that no
method was taken to recover her. But an elderly
gentleman, who
sat
near them,
observed
if they could
lift her up,
so
that
she
might be above the crowd, it
would accelerate her return to life. Accordingly, he
humanely
stepped
up on the
seat
, and
raised
her in his
arms. A
smelling
bottle was now applied, and
some
lavender rubbed on her temples.
The
bustle
this incident had
occasioned
in the pit,
attracted the notice of the company in the boxes; and
as the old gentleman
raised
the declining head of
Rachel
that
she
might receive the more benefit from the
air of
several
fans, Auberry
saw
and knew her. Like
lightning he
sprang
over the front of the box, and
rushing
through the company, was by the
side
of our
heroine
,
when returning life began to animate her lips
and cheeks; and when
she
opened her eyes, Auberry
was the
first
object that met them. The tender
solicitude
of his looks and manner,
whilst
he inquired into
the
cause
of her
disorder
, contributed to
restore
her
entirely; and having thanked the old gentleman for
his care, and made room for Auberry to
sit
between
herself
and Polly
Webster
, as he held her hand, and
spoke
to her of his mother, Dr. Lenient, and the
rest
of their acquaintance in
Lancashire
,
she
entirely
forgot
both her
indisposition
and its
cause
.
Though the
impulse
of the moment had urged
Hamden Auberry, in direct
opposition
to every rule
of
politeness
or even propriety, to quit his company
and
spring
into the pit, when he beheld the
lifeless
form of Rachel, yet when he now
saw
her perfectly
recovered, he remembered the
necessity
of immediately
returning to them, and apologizing for the
abruptness
of his conduct.
I do not feel altogether
satisfied
, my charming
Miss
Dudley,
said
he in a low voice, that the
society
in which, perhaps, you are obliged to mix, is
proper
or congenial to your feelings. Who are
these
young
women, and the young man who attends them?
I am not indeed,
said
Rachel,
situated
exactly
as I could
wish
; but I know not how to better
myself
.
Where
shall
I call on you,
said
Hamden; I
cannot now
stay
to
say
all I think. I
must
return to
my
cousin
, lady Lucy.
Is that your
cousin
?
said
Rachel, glancing her
eye upon the young lady in the box.
Yes; I came to town by my aunt's
desire
merely
to accompany her;
she
is come upon a
visit
to a friend
of her mother's, and is going with her to make a
short
tour on the continent.
And do you accompany her?
said
Rachel; but
she
dared not
raise
her eyes to his face as
she
made
the interrogation; for
she
felt that her own was
suffused
with a
blush
.
No; I
shall
only go with them as far as Dover.
But as we do not
set
forward till Saturday, I
shall
hope to
pass
a few delightful hours in your
society
previous to my journey. At what time will you be
at
leisure
to-morrow morning?
I am always at
leisure
to
see
my friends, replied
Rachel, with a
fascinating
smile
.
Hamden's countenance
expressed
his gratitude, and
the
pleasure
her
frankness
gave him, and
pressing
her
hand, he
wished
her a good night, returned to the
box, and a few moments afterwards, the whole party
in which he was engaged left the theatre.
The remainder of the performance was entirely
lost
upon our heroine. Her
person
was
present
, and
she
saw
the figures that
passed
and
repassed
before her;
but her mind was totally
absent
, and
she
might as well
have gazed upon vacancy. She was
dissatisfied
with
herself
;
she
had
discovered
that
she
was too much
interested
in whatever concerned Hamden Auberry;
she
feared too that he had
discovered
her
weakness
.
These
reflections entirely employed her thoughts.
When the performance was ended,
she
mechanically
followed her party out of the
house
. When freed
from the hurry of coaches, chairs, orange-women,
link-boys, and the crowd that had
just
immerged from
the play-
house
,
she
took hold of Polly's arm, and in
silence
pursued
her walk home. When
she
entered
the parlour
she
asked
for a candle, and would have
retired to her chamber; but Mrs.
Webster
had
prepared
some
little delicacy for her
supper
, and
she
had
too much good-nature and
politeness
to
refuse
sitting
up to partake of it.
The
curiosity
of Spriggins and the two elder
Websters
was excited by the behaviour of Hamden
Auberry
.
They had talked it over as they walked home
together
,
and all agreed that he was certainly a lover.
The company he was with declared he was of a
superior
rank in life; but they had not been quite
pleased
that our heroine had neglected to introduce them.
He is a
monstrous
handsome
man,
said
Belle, the
second
daughter.
He is well enough,
said
the
eldest
, but he
seems
so
proud and
self
-conceited.
We'll joke
Miss
Rachel a little about him at
supper
time,
said
Spriggins.
I wonder what made her faint,
said
Belle.
Why lawk, Belle! replied the
sister
, you know
she
has always lived in the country, and
so
I
suppose
the lights, and the
noise
, and the heat
Just
then they arrived at home, and in a few
minutes
they were all
seated
round the
supper
table.
Miss
Dudley has been very ill at the play,
mamma
,
said
Polly.
Yes, indeed, cried the
eldest
,
she
fainted quite
away, and there was
such
a fine gentleman jumped
out of the box and came to her, I believe he is an old
acquaintance.
I believe
so
too,
said
Belle, laughing; for he
seemed
monstrous
anxious, and looked
so
happy when
she
began to recover.
He is an old acquaintance,
said
Rachel, at once
distressed
and flattered by the manner in which his
anxiety and
assiduity
was mentioned; it was Major
Auberry, madam,
addressing
herself
to Mrs.
Webster
;
the
son
of our
respected
friend.
Indeed! Well, I have not
seen
him
since
he was
an infant; and
besides
, if he even remembered me, he
is
so
much
amongst
the great folks, it would be
beneath
him to notice me, or any of my family, though
his mother and I, when girls, were
just
like
sisters
.
Yes, yes, cried Spriggins,
whose
self
-
consequence
had been lowered by his being entirely overlooked by
the Major; yes! when folks get up in the world,
they generally forget their poor friends.
But I dare affirm Major Auberry is not one of
those
kind of people,
said
Rachel; he intends calling
on me to-morrow, and I have no doubt but he will
rejoice
in being introduced to Mrs.
Webster
and her family.
Well, we
shall
see
! cried Spriggins; but I am
sure
he is not overburthened with good manners, or he
would have
said
good night, or your
servant
, or
some
such
like, to me, when he went away; for though
mayhap I am not
so
grand, nor
so
fine, nor
so
learned,
I thinks I
understands
good-breeding as well as any
Y 2
body. And for the matter of that, a man is but a
man, and I don't
see
why wearing a laced coat, or
being
called Sir, or My Lord, or Your Grace, makes
one man a bit better than another.
Rachel found that it would be in vain to attempt
defending Hamden
against
the complaints and
prejudices
of Spriggins,
whose
contracted mind and very
small
portion of
understanding
, would not
suffer
him
to comprehend
those
nice
distinctions
which, allowing
for the natural equality of man,
still
preserves
that
respect
,
that
necessary
subordination
, due from inferiors
to
persons
of
shining
abilities, liberal education, and
superior
understanding
; and the ignorant,
self-opinionated
being who prates of equality, never once
conceives
the
cause
of the
distinction
, which education
(more than any other
cause
) makes between man and
man.
Persons
of large fortunes are enabled to enjoy
the benefits of
instruction
in its
most
extended
sense
;
and they who have cultivated their minds with care,
whose
tastes
and manners are highly
polished
, feel
as great a repugnance to the
society
of the vulgar
ignorant, in whom mean pride,
obstinacy
and vanity
in general combine, as the pure and uncontaminated
mind would feel in being forced into an
intercourse
with the vicious. But Rachel knew
these
arguments,
if advanced, would have no effect on Spriggins;
she
therefore
listened
in
silence
to the end of his harangue,
then
wishing
them all a good night, retired to her
apartment.
CHAP. X.
Matters of
Consequence
.
The
next morning by ten o'clock, Hamden
Auberry
was in Dartmouth-
street
. He was
introduced
to Mrs.
Webster
and her daughters; to the
former
,
as the friend of his mother, he was uncommonly
respectful
, and he
spoke
to the girls with
such
freedom
,
politeness
and affability, that when they went
into the adjoining room, Belle declared he was a
most
captivating man.
Polly
said
she
hoped, if he was going to marry dear
Miss
Dudley, that he was as good as he was
handsome
.
For if he was a king, he could not be too good
for her.
Marry,
said
the
eldest
, putting up her lip, I
dare
say
he would be frightened to hear you
say
such
a thing. No! no! young men of his rank and
fashion
don't often marry poor girls; if they did, I
don't
see
why
some
folks might not
stand
as good a
chance as others. And
she
cast
a
sly
glance at the
looking-
glass
, which hung directly
opposite
to where
she
was
sitting
.
Hamden, in this interview with our heroine, felt his
admiration
increase
. Every
circumstance
that had
taken place during her
residence
in London,
she
recapitulated
to him, with an ingenuous freedom that
captivated his heart,
whilst
his
reason
applauded the
involuntary tribute of admiration and
respect
, her
manners and
sentiments
exacted.
When
she
had
finished
her
artless
recital, (which
was drawn forth by his inquiries, not voluntarily
obtruded
on his attention) You are, I fear, improperly,
as well as uncomfortably
situated
,
said
he with
energy
.
I acknowledge it, replied Rachel, but I
must
bear it with patience; there is no remedy.
What do you mean, my dear
Miss
Dudley? You
surely
have friends.
I dare
say
I have, Sir, many friends; but I
should
be
sorry
to
trespass
on their
goodness
.
Is it
possible
Miss
Dudley can imagine He
was proceeding, but
she
stopped
him.
Do not
misunderstand
me, Major Auberry; I do
not think meanly of my friends, but I am
conscious
of
my own defects; I am too proud to live in a
state
of
servile
dependence.
Good heavens! what do you mean?
Nothing very extraordinary. My brother is
absent
;
my late dear father's agent, I greatly fear, is
difhonest
;
and perhaps I
shall
find it
necessary
to be
industrious
,
in order to continue in
some
degree
respectable
.
She
said
this without
embarrassment
, and with a
cheerful
smile
. She felt no degradation in the idea of
exerting her talents to procure
support
.
Hamden was
silent
; a certain
something
struck
cold
upon his heart. No wonder; it was the cold, hard
drop that turns whatever it falls upon to
stone
.
Poverty
has a
most
unaccountable petrifying quality;
many a heart has it rendered impenetrable as adamant;
many a
bosom
has it
incased
in marble, or enveloped
in ice,
so
firmly congealed, that only the
sun
of
prosperity
,
riding in full meridian, could
soften
or relax
it. Hamden felt the cold chill run trembling through
every nerve; but his heart defied its frigid power, and
glowed with more fervour. He
said
but little after
this explanation, and
soon
took his leave.
On his return to his lodgings, he thus inquired of
himself
. Do I love Rachel Dudley?
Most
assuredly
,
beyond all other women. Does
she
return my
passion
?
That is a
question
yet to be determined. If I might
judge from the intelligence of her eyesBut hope
may be
presumption
. Would I marry her? Yes, with
delight and
transport
, if
she
would accept me. What?
in defiance of my aunt's
wishes
and injunctions?
Here was a moment's
pause
. At length he
proceeded
in his
questions
. Would I be willing to
relinquish
all hope of future affluence, honour, title, and
devote my life to
obscurity
and Rachel Dudley? I
fear not. I
should
repine at the advantages I had
relinquished
,
and embitter her life by my own
fruitless
regret. Then is it honourable, by indirect attentions,
to lead her to
suppose
she
has an
exclusive
preference
in my
bosom
, or to awaken expectations, which will
end only in
disappointment
? Certainly no.
After thus
closely
interrogating his own heart,
Hamden
determined to avoid
visiting
Rachel again; but
on the morning following, he received a letter from his
mother; it would be but kind to call and let
Miss
Dudley
know her friend Dr. Lenient was well, and that Tabitha
Holdfast
had taken to
herself
a help-mate of one of
the faithful.
He accordingly went; one
visit
produced another.
Prudence on one
side
, and pride on the other, were for
a while forgotten. Hamden talked of love, and
Rachel
listened
with complacency.
It was on a fine evening in the beginning of
September
,
as wandering on the banks of the Thames, where
a row of young willows drooped their pendent
branches
over the
softly
gliding
stream
, that Hamden (on
whose
arm Rachel reclined with the confidence of
fraternal
affection)
spoke
of the happy
intercourse
of
congenial
minds.
Dear, charming Rachel!
said
he, it
seems
as
though our
souls
were formed at the
same
moment,
and partake of congenial particles.
Our
sentiments
are certainly much alike in
most
things,
said
Rachel.
And why not in every thing, cried Hamden
eagerly
.
Why, my lovely friend, loving as we love
each other, (for you do not deny though you
hesitate
to avow your affection) why do we not
sanctify
that
affection by the
most
solemn
vows?
You have an aunt, Hamden Auberry,
said
Rachel
with
firmness
, and on her depends your future
fortune. She will not approve of the untitled,
unportioned
Rachel for your wife.
Do not name her. I will renounce her favour.
I will henceforth live but for you.
Hamden,
said
Rachel, and her features
assumed
a
serene
solemnity
that was
almost
celestial
,
Hamden
,
I have not
expressed
the feelings of my
soul
,
because
I was
sensible
of the
impossibility
of our ever
being
united with the
consent
of your aunt; and know,
though you were dearer to me than life
itself
, I will
never intrude
myself
into a family, who would think
themselves
degraded by the alliance. That I am an
unconnected being, is certain; no one has a right to
say
, Rachel, why
dost
thou
so
? But I have a heart
that tells me when I err. To the reproaches of this
trusty
,
silent
monitor, I will never
subject
myself
; to
the contumely and
consures
of the world I am
invulnerable
;
they too often misjudge and condemn the
innocent unheard.
Sweet, charming
moralist
, whither
wouldst
thou
lead me?
said
Hamden.
To
happiness
, I hope,
said
Rachel
smiling
.
That I feel my heart glow with
esteem
to you,
continued
she
, is a truth I
wish
not to deny; but
that
esteem
is pure; nor
personal
interest
, nor hope of
future aggrandizement, will ever bias me. You
ask
me for a wife; here is my hand; let us
sanctify
our
loves in the face of Heaven. Enable me to
satisfy
my dear Renben, when he returns, that I have not
dishonoured
the name of Dudley; and for the
indiscriminating
,
curious, idle multitude, let them think as they
may. Happy in your affection, their
smile
or their
frown will be alike
inconsequential
.
The gratitude of Hamden was
manifested
in wild,
enthusiastic
expressions
of
everlasting
love. But
Hamden's
pride
still
predominated, and he accepted the
title of
husband
to an amiable woman,
whose
virtue
and
understanding
would have done honour to a
diadem
;
yet, fearing to forfeit the paltry
distinctions
of
wealth and title, he
suffered
her to bear the ignominy
of
suspicion
, and the
bitterness
of reproach, from
those
who neither comprehended or could
estimate
her merit.
They were married in St. John's Church,
Westminster
;
and Rachel removed to a lodging provided for
her by her
husband
in the neighbourhood of
Mary-lebone
.
When Rachel
proposed
removing from Mrs.
Webster's
,
she
found no
small
difficulty in
satisfying
her
inquiries
respectting
the
cause
of her removal. She had
imprudently acquainted Mrs.
Webster
with the
diminished
state
of her finances; when therefore on the
morning of her marriage, which took place a little
after eight o'clock; for Rachel, though
she
had now
been
some
months in London, continued the
ome">some
months in London, continued the
health-giving
custom
of early
rising
, and frequcntly walked
before
breakfast
,
so
that it was nothing extraordinary
for her to be abroad
so
early; when, in
consequence
of this union,
she
prepared to quit her lodging, and
gave Mrs.
Webster
a bank bill for forty pounds,
requesting
her to get it changed, the old lady looked at
her with a
scrutinizing
eye; and though not apt to
make remarks, could not avoid
speaking
to our
heroine
in the following words:
It is no
business
of mine, to be
sure
,
Miss
Dudley;
but I am afraid you are going to do a very
imprudent
thing. To your family and connexions I am a
total
stranger
; but for the
sake
of my friend, Mrs.
Auberry, I could
wish
you had conducted
yourself
with
more
circumspection
.
In what, madam?
said
Rachel indignantly,
have I
transgressed
the laws of prudence?
You have received the
visits
of
several
young men.
Mr. Oliver, I concluded, was your lover for
some
time; but after
visiting
, taking you on parties of
pleasure
,
and being as attentive as man could be,
whisk
he
goes off into the country, and there's an end of the
matter.
Rachel could not help
smiling
as
she
repliedMr.
Oliver, I believe, madam, never thought of me in any
other light than as a friend. I am
so
happy as to be
esteemed
by his
sister
, and for her
sake
he
shewed
me,
whilst
he
stayed
in town, more than common
respect
.
Well, it may be
so
; but it had a very odd
appearance
though. Then came Mr. Courtney. I made
quite certain that he would be the happy man, when,
behold!
instead
of you, he marries
Miss
La Varone.
To be certain,
she
was a clever
sort
of a body; but
then one would have thought a young man would
not be at a
loss
to
choose
between you and her.
Well, you find he was not at a
loss
,
answered
Rachel rather petulantly.
And now, continued Mrs.
Webster
, not noticing
her reply, now here has been Major Auberry,
dancing
attendance above a month
past
. I am afraid he
means no good; he is, as one may
say
, one of the
quality folks; and his aunt, lady Anne, would no
more agree to his marrying a poor girl, than
she
would
to his going to
Jerusalem
. What then does he
design
?
Take care,
Miss
Dudley, do not let him make you his
dupe. You are going from me; for what
purpose
,
or into
whose
protection, you have not thought proper
to tell me; however, that is neither here nor there.
As I
said
before, it is no
business
of mine. But when
I think, that not a fortnight
since
you
shewed
me the
contents of your
purse
, which were very trifling, and
declared it was all you
possessed
in the world, and that
I now
see
you in
possession
of forty pounds, I cannot
help thinking all is not as it
should
be.
I thank you, madam, for your care and anxiety
on my account,
said
Rachel, who perceived, in Mrs.
Webster
's manner, more of
curiosity
than real
solicitude
for her welfare, but to quiet your
apprehensions
,
permit me to
assure
you, I
shall
be careful never to
offend
against
virtue and morality. My conduct may
incur
censure
, but
shall
never be criminal.
Whilst
my dear brother is from England, I hold
myself
accountable
to no one for my actions; and
whilst
my
own heart acquits me of any breach of my duties
either moral or religious, I am perfectly indifferent as
to what opinion the world in general may form
concerning
me.
Thus argued Rachel; but her ideas were erroneous,
and
she
found, when too late, it is not only
necessary
to be virtuous, but to appear
so
. Alas! pity it is, but
the
semblance
is often more
respected
than the reality.
I
suppose
we
shall
see
you
sometimes
,
Miss
Dudley
?
said
Mrs.
Webster
with a
sneer
, as
she
took leave
of her.
Rachel
slightly
answered
in the affirmative,
shook
hands with her and Belle,
kissed
the affectionate little
Polly (who
stood
sobbing
by the window) and put a
guinea into her hand; then ordering her trunk to be
placed in a hackney-coach that waited at the door,
she
stepped
in, drew up the
glass
, and a few moments
conveyed
her to her new lodgings, where her
husband
was ready to receive her.
The attachment of our heroine to Major Auberry
was pure as it was ardent.
Accustomed
from infancy
to confine her affections within a narrow circle,
she
would have felt no repugnance to
seclude
herself
from
all other
society
, could
she
have been certain by
so
doing to
insure
his eternal love and
sidelity
. She had
asked
leave of Hamden to inform
Jessy
Oliver, with
whom
she
regularly
corresponded
, of the change in her
circumstances
; but he
sorbade
her. She
acquiesced
in
silence
.
It had never entered her mind, that an unknown
indrividual
like
herself
, could excite the
curiosity
of her
neighbours. She was the
least
inquisitive
of any
human
being. Of what
consequence
,
she
would
often
say
, is the
business
,
pleasures
or
pursuits
of
others
to me. I harbour no ill will towards any; and
have I a right to
scrutinize
their actions? No.
Hamden Auberry,
still
the
slave
of pride, and
fearing
to forfeit the favour of lady Anne,
suffered
his
wife to go by the
assumed
name of Dacres. Our
heroine
too was equally the
slave
of the
same
passion
, but
it was of a more laudable kind. He
sacrified
the
reputation of a virtuous woman, rather than
relinquish
the
insignificant
distinction
wealth and power could
give; and
she
nobly (though romantically) braved
the
censures
of the world, to evince her thorough
contempt
of both.
CHAP. XI.
Across
the Atlantic.
As
Variety is
said
to be the
sascinating
charm that
intrances the
senses
, awakens attention, and,
displaying
her many coloured wings in a
thousand
different
lights,
obscures
from our view the
scythe
and
glass
of Time, and
suffers
him to
pass
unheeded by;
at her
shrine
I kneel, her aid I invoke. Come,
enchanting
phantom, who, as thou
passest
momentarily,
assumest
some
new
some
charming form. Whether
as
pleasure
, tripping lightly forward, thy temples
wreathed with
roses
, and thy hands
striking
with
sportive
Z
lay the dulcet lyre; or whether, in the robe of
sonrow
clad, with pale, cold cheek, and uplift, tearful
eye; or cheerful
industry
, with placid
smile
, with
bosom
tranquil, and with moderate
scrip
,
stored
with
life's comforts, not its
superfluities
; or as meek
patience
,
bowing with
submission
before the keen
blast
of
undeserved
calamity; whatever
shape
thou
dost
assume
,
to me thou art welcome.
Haston
then, for
with thee ever comes the
Muse
. Her
vestments
white
clasped
by a golden zone, her
buskined
leg half bare,
her auburn
tresses
floating in the wind; her veil,
which part conceals her beauteous face, and part plays
loosely
in the breeze, wrought with devices
strange
and rare;
History
, Poetry, Fiction and Truth,
blended
so
soft
as to relieve each other; ethereal
vision
, come; I wait thee here. For many is the
painful hour thou
hast
soothed
; many the
heartache
thou
hast
lightened.
Weariness
has fled at thy
approach, and the
still
hour of night has been as
cheerful
as the full blaze of day.
`But, madam, if you
please
, we would prefer a
little
less
of the figurative, and a little more plain matter
of fact.'
Pardon me, gentle reader. I forgot I was writing
the
history
of Reuben and Rachel, and was giving you
the
history
of my own
seelings
.
A poor
substitute
, you
say
. I acknowledge the
truth of the
observation
, and therefore return to my hero.
After a
passage
of thirty days, Reuben Dudley
arrived
safe
in the Delaware, and on the thirty-
second
day after his departure from Liverpool, landed in the
city of Philadelphia. He had with him
several
letters of,
what is called, recommendation from merchants in
Liverpool, to their
trans
-atlantic
correspondents
; but
they contained nothing more than a general mention
of his family, and that his character and morals had
been hitherto unimpenched.
I will not inquire out the gentlemen to whom
these
letters are directed, till I have
seen
my good
friend Jacob Holmes,
said
Reuben to
himself
, as he
walked up the main
street
. He will, without doubt,
accompany me, when I
wish
to
visit
them. How glad
will he be to
see
me, continued he mentally. His
natural love to my
sister
and
self
, his gratitude to my
father
At the remembrance of his father, Reuben's heart
became full; and when he
seated
himself
in the tavern
to which he had been recommended, and began to
reflect
seriously
upon where he was, and that it was more
than probable his father might have been in that very
house
, in that very room, nay, he might have
rested
on
the identical chair he was now
seated
on, the
fulness
of his heart overflowed at his eyes, and he indulged in
the
effusion
without
restraint
.
He had ordered
some
supper
. As the
master
of
the
house
came in with it, Reuben
asked
him if he had
ever known one Mr. Dudley, who had
resided
in
Philadelphia
between two and three years.
The landlord had, previous to the
question
being
asked
, drawn a chair to the
opposite
side
of the table
to that where our hero was
seated
, and when he heard
the interrogation,
answered
it by another.
I expect he is
some
relative of yours, by your being
so
inquisitive
about him.
He was,
said
Reuben mournfully, a very near
and dear relative.
So I expect, replied the landlord. Pray where
is he now?
In heaven,
said
Reuben,
raising
his eyes,
whilst
every
pulsation
vibrated in exulting confidence of his
father's worth.
You
must
not be too
sure
of that,
said
the
landlord
.
Had you known him, Sir,
said
Reuben with a
firm and
earnest
manner, you would have no more
doubt of his
present
happiness
than I have.
I did know him, replied the
host
.
Then you knew one of the
best
men that ever
lived
.
Yea, he was good in the worldly acceptation of
the word; he did alms, told no lies, hated no one,
paid every man, yea, more than his due; but all this
is vanity, filthy rags, unclean
vestments
. He was not
one of the
chosen
; he was in a
lost
state
.
Here a
dispute
ensued
, in which Reuben evidently
lost
ground with his
antagonist
; for Reuben argued
with
coolness
, and took
reason
for his monitor;
whereas
his opponent was wild,
enthusiastic
, and extremely
ignorant. He had adopted
some
eccentric ideas in
regard to religion, and he
asserted
that his opinions
were right,
because
they were, and that all who
did not think exactly as he did, were in the high road
to
destruction
, for the
same
unanswerable
reason
,
because
they were.
Before Reuben had
finished
his
supper
, the landlord
left him, to impart to his
spouse
all he had learnt
concerning
the
stranger
. The
curiosity
of Jael was not
satisfied
with this intelligence of her helpmate's.
Thou
hast
learned nothing, Zekell,
said
she
; I
will go and
question
the young man
myself
.
Jael entered the parlour.
You are
just
arrived,
said
she
,
sitting
down in the
place her
husband
had
just
left.
Yes,
just
landed.
From England?
Yes.
What part?
Liverpool.
Liverpool?
Yes.
I expect you have got
some
kinsfolks in the city.
Not that I know of.
No friends, no acquaintances?
Oh yes! Do you know Jacob Holmes?
Yes, to be
sure
I do.
Master
has
reason
to know
him; he is a dire hard man to deal with.
What
business
does he follow?
Business
! Well, I expect you don't know much
about him, to
ask
that
question
. Why Jacob Holmes
is one of our
grandest
men, for all he be a Quaker.
And then he married
such
a grand woman; why I
expect
she
had a matter of five hundred pounds to her
fortin.
Mr. Holmes is married then?
What, did not you know that? Well, I thought
you were a
boasting
sort
of fellow, pretending to know
folks who you never
saw
'd.
How long has he been married?
said
Reuben.
Why I expect it is about a year and a half ago.
So long?
Yes,
so
long; and madam Holmes has got a
sweet
little baby, about three months old.
Reuben
paused
a moment, and then without
reflection
exclaimed, Why he
must
have married
immediately
after my father's departure for England.
And pray what may be your name?
said
Jael,
placing both her elbows on the table, and
resting
her
chin on her hands,
whilst
her large blue
glass
eyes
were fixed on the face of our hero with a
most
unmeaning
stare
.
My name is Dudley, replied Reuben.
So I expected,
said
she
, and
something
like low
cunning informed her broad and
inexpressive
features.
And
so
you are cum'd to look ater the fortin
squire
Dudley left?
Even
so
, replied Reuben,
pushing
from him the
plate that contained his
almost
untasted
supper
. How
far from Philadelphia does the late Mr. Dudley's
estate
lay, and which is my
nearest
road to it?
Ah, young man!
said
Jael, I expect you be
cum'd on a fool's errant. It matters not to you where
it lies; he never paid for it; and cording to counts
that we have heard, the
squire
owed a pretty deal
before
he cum'd from home.
Reuben
started
. Of whom are you
speaking
?
said
he.
Of
squire
Dudley.
What Dudley? what was his
Christian
name?
Name! name! I can't
just
now
say
; but I expect
it was a bible name.
Was it Reuben?
asked
our hero eagerly.
I do expect it was,
said
the woman,
rising
without
the
least
emotion, and beginning to remove the
supper
from the table.
Z 2
Oh! my dear father! exclaimed Reuben, and
his
respiration
became
so
difficult that he was obliged
to walk to the window and throw up the
sash
.
Jael replaced the
dish
upon the table, and with a
look and manner to which no
description
can do
justice
,
thus
addressed
him:
If
squire
Dudley was your father, I wonder how
you got
safe
over
sea
. Nobody was
surprised
when they
heard he was
cast
away and drownded; for he was as
great a reprobate as ever lived.
Reprobate! repeated Reuben with vehemence,
and his eyes
flashed
resentment
,
whilst
his heart
swelled
almost
to
bursting
.
Yes, reprobate, repeated Jael, and I expect you
will find a pretty many folks in Philidelphy that will
tell you as how here he comed over
sea
, and
pretended
to be a
vast
rich man.
'Tis
false
! cried Reuben; I would
stake
my
existence
upon his probity. My father would have
scorned
to pretend to any thing more than he could
make appear reality.
But I
say
he did though,
said
Jael; giving
away his
interest
as a body may
say
,
selling
his goods
at half-price, that, as he
said
, the poor might buy as
well as the rich. Then if he
saw
a man that wanted,
he never inquired whether he was a
Christian
or a
Papish
,
but lent or gav'd him what he axed.
And a
just
and beneficent God will reward him
for it,
said
Reuben,
raising
his eyes fervently. He
is now, I
trust
, reaping the reward of his
philanthropy
.
It mought a been all very well, continued Jael,
not noticing the ejaculation of our hero, had he only
given away his own; but to deal
so
hardly as he did
by that pious young man, Jacob HolmesOh! it was
a wicked thing.
Reuben approached a few
steps
towards his
hostess
,
and then
stopped
, fixed in
curiosity
and amazement;
amazed at the malignity with which this ignorant
woman endeavoured to
asperse
the memory of his
father, (
whilst
every
sentence
till the
last
,
must
appear
in the eye of pure religion and candour as his
highest
culogium) and curious to know from what
source
this
malignity proceeded;
whilst
Jael, leaning over the
back of the chair from which
she
had
arisen
, her
features
still
fixed and without
expression
, in the
same
monotonous tone of voice proceeded:
It is a
serious
thing, young man, a very
serious
thing, for one to be left gardeen to a wealthy child.
Oh! it is a trying matter, a grand
snare
, laid by
Satan
,
the mighty tempter, the great deceiver. Money
is the root and
spring
of all evil; it is the bait the
wicked one makes
use
of to draw the children of
vanity
astray
, as he did thy father. Oh! it was an
abomination
for him to keep Jacob Holmes as he did,
without
even pocket money,
whilst
he was throwing away
his
interest
by handfuls.
I do not
understand
you,
said
Reuben; Jacob
Holmes was an orphan child, adopted, brought up
and educated by the charity of my father.
Ah! that was the
story
squire
Dudley told, when
he
first
comed here; but we knows better things now.
It was the money of the good Jacob Holmes on which
he was living; for I expect if it had been his own he
would a been more careful of it. But thy father,
young man, has wronged the orphan of his right, and
made
himself
rich at the
expense
of the
son
of the
widow, and the
curses
of the widow and the orphan
will
rest
upon him and his children.
So be it, cried Reuben; I fear no judgment
for my father's actions. Oh that I may be enabled to
emulate his virtues, to tread his
footsteps
But I feel
I am to blame in
listening
to one,
whose
aim is to
caluminate
the memory of him who gave me being.
What could he have done to
deserve
thy hatred, that
even his
sacred
dust
cannot
rest
in peace? Did he ever
wrong thee or thy family?
No, not he; I expect he was the means of my
getting a matter a twenty pounds or
so
, that I
should
a
lost
; but then, though it did me a
kindness
, it did
not tell much to his credit, though (as
master
said
)
we got our money, and what matter was it to us who
paid it?
True, cried Reuben, that could be of but
little
consequence
indeed; but pray tell me, how came
my father to render you this
service
?
Why I expect it is
so
long a
story
, you will be
tired.
Tell it as
concisely
as
possible
,
said
Reuben; I
will
answer
for my patience; and even
should
it be
more lengthy than I expect, when a father's good
deeds are the theme, what
son
could be weary or feel
his attention flag?
Jael looked at him, with mouth and eyes extended.
She comprehended nothing more than that he
desired
to hear how his father happened to pay her twenty
pounds;
so
,
still
leaning over the back of the chair,
she
began:
I expect it's a matter a three years agone, a
woman
comed over in a
ship
from London, an
she
said
as
how
she
comed ater her
husband
. She was as pretty
a body, I expect, as one mought
see
in a hundred.
Master
and I was
just
married, and got into this here
house
. So
she
comed an wanted to board with us,
an
she
had a baby with her about
six
months old. So
she
had plenty of money, an a golden watch, an a
power of fine clothes;
so
we let her have our
best
room, an hired a girl to wait on her.
Plenty of money, a gold watch, and fine clothes,
said
Reuben mentally, and he turned from the
selfish
narrator to hide his indignation and contempt.
Well, ater a while,
she
continued, we found as
how the
parson
she
cum'd ater was not her
husband
;
he had kept her company, and I expect,
promised
to
marry her; but he would neither own her nor her
child when he
saw
'd her here. So
she
did nothing but
cry, and cry, and
kiss
her little girl;
she
was too proud
to work, and
so
, when her money was
spent
, and her
golden watch
sold
,
she
said
she
wished
to die.
Poor, unfortunate girl,
said
Reuben in a tone of
commiseration
, how I pity her!
Pity her indeed,
said
Jael, a creeter! When I
told her
she
mought get a good living by going out to
sarvice
,
she
said
she
knew not how to labour for bread;
them was her very words, an
so
she
would not eat nor
drink, an
used
to go night ater night with her clothes
on,
sitting
on the floor, and
resting
her head on a chair
or the window-feat. She at
last
grew
so
weak, that
she
was not able to walk;
so
I went and axed her
what
she
meant by going on
so
; for
she
know'd as
how
she
owed me above twelve pound;
so
she
only
answered
me, `
she
meant and
wished
to die, and at
once
release
me and
herself
.' But then
she
would
hug her baby, and cry, `Poor little wretch! what
will become of you? It were better we both died
together
.
Reuben's eyes
glistened
with the dew of
sensibility
,
but he was
silent
.
So at
last
she
fell into a
consumption
; I expect it
was all owing to her pride that was
so
humbled and
mortified. So
seeing
as how
she
was like to become a
trouble to
master
, I told her how
she
must
go about
her
business
; for I wanted my room to let to
somebody
else
.
Did you tell the poor dying creature
so
?
said
Reuben, in a tone
expressive
at once of anger and
commiseration
;
did you tell her
so
?
Yes, I did,
said
Jael; for you knows
self-preservation
is the
first
law in nature, and 'tis but right
one
should
christen
their own child
first
. So madam
got up, and with her child in her hand crawled down
stairs
; and when
she
got into the kitchen,
she
fainted
away. So
squire
Dudley was in the next room, and
he heard the
bustle
in the kitchen, and came out to
axe what was the matter;
so
when I told him, he
threw me the money
she
owed me; but he called me
a very bad name. Then he got two men to carry the
sick
body to his own lodging in an arm chair, an there
he had her tended and doctored; but that did no good,
for
she
died. An there he took the child, and had it
put out to
nurse
, though every body
said
he ought to
be
ashamed
of
himself
for doing any thing for
such
a
sort
of woman.
Oh my father! my father! exclaimed Reuben,
ought not thy
son
to exult that thy character was
such
, that even the
aspersions
of thy enemies are thy
highest
praise
?And where is the poor child?
addressing
himself
to the woman.
Dead; for ater the
squire
went away, Jacob
Holmes would not pay for its being
nursed
; and who
can blame him? There had been enough of his
interest
wasted
already.
I tell thee, woman,
said
Reuben, Jacob Holmes
never had any property whatever but what he enjoyed
from the beneficence of my father.
I expect that
story
won't do you much good
here,
said
Jael; but
howsoever
, you axed about the
child, an
so
as I was
saying
, it went to the poor-
house
,
and there it died.
As Jael
finished
this
history
,
she
took the
dish
and
plate from the table, and left the room, and Reuben
shortly
after retired to bed, but not to
rest
. To find
his father's memory traduced, to find Jacob Holmes
in actual
possession
of his
estate
, and believed
universally
the lawful owner of it, was a
shock
he had never
dreamed of receiving, and knew not how to
support
.
As he had imagined he
should
, without the
least
difficulty
,
take immediate
possession
of the effects his father
had left in Holmes's care, and as he knew there
must
be
considerable
money in his hands,
arising
from the
sale
of merchandize with which he had been
entrusted
,
our hero had taken but a very
small
sum
of money
with him from England. Indeed his finances in
general
were in
so
confined a
state
, that he could not
command
a
sum
of any
consequence
. It was therefore no
small
addition to his
uneasy
sensations
, that he was in
a
strange
land, with very little money, and without a
single
friend. However, he determined the next
morning
to
visit
Jacob Holmes; for,
still
unwilling to
believe
human nature could be guilty of
such
depravity,
or that a man, adding
dishonesry
to ingratitude, would
return the benevolence of the father by wronging the
son
, he indulged a feeble hope, that his reception would
be better than from what he had heard he had a right
to expect.
After a
restless
and perturbated night, he
arose
with
the
earliest
dawn, and having inquired for a
horse
, was
preparing to
visit
Jacob, when, as he went to the door
with the
design
of mounting, he
saw
the identical
person
he was going in
search
of
just
alighting. Spite of
the intelligence he had received from Jael, Reuben's
heart warmed with affection, when he beheld a
person
who had been
so
dear to his father, and who had borne
himself
and
sister
in his arms a
thousand
times. He
darted forward, and took his hand. Jacob,
said
he, in a tone of fraternal
tenderness
, Jacob, how are
you?
Well, I thank thee, young man, replied Jacob,
coldly withdrawing his hand, and
stalking
with
upright
formality into the
house
.
Though chilled by his frigid manner, Reuben felt
his heart contract, yet he followed him into the parlour,
and laying his hand upon his
shoulder
, cried, Don't
you know me, Jacob?
No, really, young man, thou
hast
greatly the
advantage
of me; I do not recollect ever to have
seen
thee before.
Nearly
six
years had
elapsed
since
Jacob had left
England, and a period of that length might naturally
be
supposed
to make a material alteration in the
person
of a youth, whom it had transformed, as it
past
,
from a cheerful, blooming boy, to the graceful,
well-informed
man. But
still
there was
sufficient
in his
manner, voice and features, to inform Jacob Holmes,
at one glance, who it was
addressed
him. But Jacob
had found a
short
memory very
useful
on many
occasions
,
and was determined to try its efficacy on this;
and therefore boldly
asserted
he had never, to his
recollection
,
seen
Reuben before.
Look at me again, friend Jacob,
said
our hero,
you
surely
cannot totally forget the face of
Reuben
Dudley, the
son
of your friend, Mr. Dudley, of
Laneashire
.
I do remember thee now,
said
Jacob; but how
is it, young man, that I
see
thee in the garb of the
children
of vanity? thy father wore it not.
Reuben was now
struck
by
observing
the very
formal
and primitive appearance of Jacob. I hope I
am not the
less
pious,
said
Reuben with a
smile
,
because
my coat is not cut in the
same
fashion
as thine,
or my hat quite
so
large. I am come to inquire after
my father's effects, and to
release
you from the
trouble
you have
so
long had, of attending to concerns
which may interfere with your own
business
and
pursuits
.
Thou art welcome to Philadelphia, friend
Reuben
,
said
Jacob,
assuming
some
small
degree of
cordiality
;
I
shall
be ready to give an account of my
stewardship
whenever thou
shalt
demand it. In the
mean time, go home with me, and
sojourn
till thou
canst
suit
thyself
better. I am going
across
the river
on
some
little matter of
business
; when I return, we
will go together to my
house
.
Ah!
said
Reuben, after Jacob had left him, I
fear this man has a
dishonest
heart; but I will not
judge too
hastily
.
Towards evening, Jacob returned, and with our
hero proceeded to the
house
of Mr. Dudley, which
he now claimed as his own. It was
situated
on the
declivity of a hill, that,
rising
gradually behind it,
sheltered
it from the wintry
blasts
, and
whose
sides
were covered with a variegated wood; the
spreading
pine, the cedar, the wild walnut, the hiccory, the birch,
the oak, were intermingled, and beautifully
diversified
the foliage,
whilst
here and there the
parsimon
tree
displayed
its tempting but deceitful fruit, which, like
the frivolous
pleasures
of the world, are lovely to the
eye when viewed at a
distance
; but when
tasted
,
disappoint
the expectation, and its
harsh
acidity is
rejected
with
disgust
. Here too, in native beauty, bloomed
the
laurestinus
, and here innumerable wild flowering
shrubs
, gave
richness
and
fascination
to the
scene
,
whilst
the mild
south
-
west
breeze
wasted
their delicious
odours to the
senses
,
refreshing
and invigorating
nature
.
From the front of the
mansion
, the green banks
sloped
gently to the margin of the Schuylkill, and
displayed
the advantages of cultivation. Here were
fields of ripened grain; here were
pastures
, where the
sheep
and cattle
reposed
in
safety
, and
feasted
on
luxuriant
verdure. To a mind
so
pure,
so
every way
formed to conceive and enjoy the beauties of nature
as was that of our hero, the
scene
was enchanting;
he rode on, wrapt in contemplation and delight. At
length perceiving the
house
, which
just
peeped from
between the
surrounding
trees, he
asked
, Is that my
father's
house
?
That is my
house
,
said
Jacob.
And how far from hence is my father's place?
This is the place the
designed
to
purchase
.
Designed
?
Yes, but he went away before he concluded the
bargain, and I have
since
made it mine.
They had now reached the
house
, entered a large
gate and
dismounted
, when Jacob, with affected
solemnity
and humility, welcomed Reuben to his
homely
dwelling, and
presented
him to his wife Dinah, a
pretty Quaker,
whose
heart was naturally good, but
whose
understanding
was
scarcely
above mediocrity,
and had been cramped by prejudice, and
whose
knowledge
of the world extended not beyond her own
immediate
family concerns. She loved Jacob
sincerely
;
he was in her eyes the
first
of human beings; and
when
she
presented
her hand to welcome Reuben, it
was with an air of friendly cordiality; for he was the
friend of her
husband
she
thought, and as
such
, claimed
the
first
place in her
esteem
, and was entitled to every
mark of
respect
and attention. She was more than
commonly careful that her
supper
should
be good in
its kind, and
served
with
neatness
. A chamber was
prepared for him by her orders, and thither he retired
at an early hour, to reflect on his own uncomfortable
situation
, and lament the ingratitude and
dishonesty
of
Jacob Holmes.

CHAP. XII.
Settlement of AccountsA Campaign.
The
next morning after
breakfast
, Reuben
requested
to
see
a
statement
of his accounts, that
he might be a judge of what he ought to do; but
Jacob
told him he expected his wife's father the
ensuing
day, and as he had been confidentially
entrusted
with
the mutual concerns between Mr. Dudley and
himself
,
he thought he would be a proper
person
to be
present
at the final
adjustment
of their accounts.
To this delay Reuben with reluctance
consented
,
and the day
passed
on heavily enough; for
notwithstanding
the novelty, beauty and variety of the
surrounding
objects, his mind was too much occupied in
reflections on his own
sorlorn
situation
, and from
thence reverted to the inconveniencies and misfortunes
to which his beloved
sister
might be
subject
,
should
he
be detained from England, and by the fraud of Jacob
Holmes rendered incapable of remitting her any
pecuniary
assistance
.
On the following morning, Jacob's father-in-law
arrived
,
and he, with great formality bringing out a
heap of papers, began to read over to our hero long
accounts of money paid.
And pray,
said
Reuben, where is the account
of the
sales
of the merchandize from whence this
money
arose
? My father left very confiderable property
in your hands, and I have every
reason
to imagine the
estate
he
purchased
here was entirely paid for, as he
drew large
sums
from his agent in England for that
purpose
.
Thou
canst
not prove what thou
dost
affert,
said
Jacob, with a look of malignant
satisfaction
; and I
believe thou wilt find it difficult to
dispossess
me of an
estate
, the title deeds of which are all made out in my
name; and to prove my right thereto, I have the
receipts
given to me for various
sums
of money, paid
by me at different times, till the whole was paid for.
But tell me,
said
Reuben,
whose
property was
the money with which you made
these
payments?
Was it not my father's.
Reuben fixed his penetrating eyes on the face of
Jacob
,
as he made this interrogation,
whose
eye fell
beneath
the
scrutinizing
glance; he dared not meet the
honest
look; his cheek turned pale, his lips trembled,
and his tongue
saltered
, as
stooping
, with a pretence
of replacing
some
papers in a box, but in reality to
hide emotions he could not
suppress
, he replied, that
the money was his own.
Oh Jacob!
said
Reuben, how
canst
thou
assert
such
a
falsehood
? Does not thy heart
smite
thee
whilst
thou art thus deliberately planning to rob the orphans
of their
just
due? His heart
swelled
; he could not
proceed.
Friend Simcox, the father-in-law of Jacob, took
upon
him to
answer
:
It was thy father, young man, who endeavoured
to wrong the orphan of his
just
due; it is thou
hast
occasion
to
blush
for his evil deeds. This worthy
young man has improved the trifle of property
Reuben
Dudley left behind him, and all demands
against
him
discharged
, there remains a
sum
amounting to
about fifty or
sixty
guineas, which Jacob is ready to
pay whenever thou
shalt
demand it; and I would
advise
thee to return home in the
first
ship
that goes.
A
conversation
now
ensued
, which convinced our
hero that he had little hope of ever obtaining his right;
for was he even to apply to the law, money would be
wanting to
prosecute
his
suit
, or to prove his right to
the
estate
, which was called Mount
Pleasant
. Mr.
Dudley had with him, at the time he was
lost
, all the
original papers
necessary
to be produced, the
duplicates
of which were in the hands of Jacob. That all
the papers were irrecoverably
lost
, Reuben had
informed
this unworthy
steward
of by letter, immediately
after
the fatal
catastrophe
.
There was another
circumstance
, which militated
much
against
him, and with which he was not
informed
till that hour. Mr. Dudley had ever placed an
unbounded
confidence in Jacob Holmes; he was a man
of
easy
disposition
, fond of agriculture, and
such
pursuits
as might ultimately tend to benefit the country
of which he was about to become an inhabitant, and
to render his new
purchase
at once beautiful and
beneficial
.
He had therefore, after having
surveyed
the
land, and had one
conversation
with the
person
of
whom he was about to
purchase
it,
entrusted
the whole
management of the
business
to Jacob. The whole of
the payment not having been made before he left
Philadelphia
,
he had never had the deeds properly
executed
,
and the news of his being drowned arriving before
they were completed, Jacob conceived the idea of
having
them filled up in his own name. He had, from
their
first
arrival in Philadelphia, been artfully
undermining
the reputation of his benefactor, by
representing
himself
as a youth of fortune
entrusted
to his
guardianship
;
and whenever he made a payment, he
always
gave the
person
to
understand
that it was his
own money that he was advancing to
serve
his friend
Dudley. This idea having been artfully propagated,
and
universally
credited, and Mr. Dudley and
himself
being equally
strangers
in the place, Jacob found no
difficulty in procuring the
estate
to be
secured
to
himself
.
He found it much more difficult to
silence
the
admonitions of his
conscience
. But the heart
naturally
ungrateful, by
easy
gradations may be habituated
to admit, and even approve, every other vice.
Gratitude
is the foundation and
source
of all the moral
virtues
.
For if we receive the many great and good
gifts of our beneficent Creator without a grateful
sensibility
,
we no longer love him; and whom we do
not love, we become indifferent, whether we obey or
serve
.
Jacob
stifled
the
remonstrances
of
conscience
; and
even when he
saw
our hero, could he have done it
without fear of the law, would
scarcely
have
hesitated
to give him a quick
passport
from this to a better
world.
The accounts
adjusted
according to the plan Jacob
had concerted, and which old friend Simcox never
scrutinized
,
because
he
wished
not to be undeceived,
the paltry
sum
of fifty-
seven
guineas was offered to
our hero, for which he was
requested
to give a
general
acquittal of all demands whatever, on the
person
or property of Jacob Holmes.
When this money and this curious acquittal were
presented
to Reuben, the one for his acceptance, the
other for his
signature
, his indignation
arose
beyond the
bounds within which he had endeavoured to confine
it. He
rose
from his
seat
,
pushing
, with an indignant
motion, the proffered money from him.
Add not
insult
to injury,
said
he, Jacob Holmes;
I would recapitulate who and what you are; but there
are
several
forcible
reasons
that oblige me to
silence
.
And
first
You, Jacob, are not
answerable
for the
faults of
those
,
whose
memories the grave has
consigned
to eternal oblivion; nor dare I
speak
of
obligations
;
for well I know he who conferred them, ever
made it a rule to fix the
seal
of
silence
on his own
good deeds, and the faults of his fellow-creatures. As
to taking the money you offer and
signing
this
acquittal
,
they are alike repugnant to my feelings. I have
no demand on your property, Jacob; I
ask
but for my
own; the property of my late dear father is mine and
my
sister
's. For
myself
, I value it not. I am young,
unencumbered, have hands to labour, or an arm to
fight. I cannot want bread. But my
sister
, lovely,
innocent, unacquainted with the world,
must
she
be
dependent?
Must
she
court the
smiles
of that world?
Must
she
submit
to the contumely of the haughty, the
slights
of the unfeeling, or the more humiliating pity
of affected
sensibility
, and in return procure the
scanty
means of bare
existence
? No! I cannot tamely give
up her right, however I might
relinquish
my own.
I do
assert
, Jacob Holmes, and you, friend Simcox, bear
witness
to the
assertion
, that this
estate
, this
house
, this
land, the
stock
and all appertaining to it, is the joint
property of
myself
and
sister
Rachel, inherited from
our father, Reuben Dudley; nor will I
relinquish
the
claim
whilst
I have
existence
.
A a 2
He took his hat, and walked towards the door;
then turning, he added
Jacob, poor as thou
hast
, by thy
dishonesty
, made
me, I pity thee. Yes, Jacob Holmes, I pity thee.
Thou
hast
reduced me to poverty, and
thyself
to
misery
.
Dinah, Jacob's wife, had overheard the
conversation
;
not at
first
intentionally, but
passing
through the
parlour that adjoined the room in which they were, and
catching a word that awakened her
curiosity
,
stopped
.
Curiosity
, when once awakened, is hard to be repelled,
at
least
in women,
say
the
opposite
sex
. Whether we
are more troubled with the
impulse
than our fathers,
brothers, or
husbands
, I will not now
dispute
; it is a
certainty Dinah
stopped
to
listen
to a
conversation
which had powerfully excited her's.
It has been remarked, that Dinah's
understanding
was not of the
most
brilliant kind; but
she
possessed
that plain, natural
sense
which enabled her to have a
full and clear perception of right and wrong. Her
wishes
were moderate, her wants few. She was
equally
a
stranger
to avarice, luxury and ambition. She
listened
to the
accusation
of Reuben, and all that
she
possessed
of
sensibility
was awakened; not that
she
feared to be deprived of part of the comforts and
conveniencies
she
at
present
enjoyed; but the man whom
she
thought the
first
and
best
of all God's creatures,
had been
accused
of fraud; if innocently, her
indignation
would fall on his
accuser
; if
justly
, then Jacob
Holmes was no longer the perfect being
she
had ever
believed him; and if guilty of
dishonesty
, Dinah felt
she
could no longer
respect
him. Yet
she
was
unwilling
to believe aught to his prejudice;
she
therefore
approached our hero as he left the apartment.
Thou
must
not leave us in anger, Reuben
Dudley
,
said
she
, laying her hand on his arm as he
attempted
to
pass
her; if Jacob has done thee wrong,
I dare affirm it was not wilfully; and if thou
canst
make it appear, he will make thee ample
restitution
.
Do not detain me, madam,
said
he, gently
freeing
himself
from her hold; I am in
haste
to depart;
but I part not in
displeasure
with you. God
bless
you, and make you as happy as you are innocent.
Then
kissing
the child, which
she
held in her arms, he
went
hastily
to the
stable
,
saddled
his
horse
, and
without
any
opposition
, mounted and proceeded to
Philadelphia
.
Dinah entered the room where her father and
husband
were
sitting
. Good Jacob,
said
she
, let not
the young man leave us in anger. I do remember
his father; I have heard him
speak
of thee with
affection
,
as though thou
hadst
been his own child. I
verily
believe he did love thee, Jacob; for his
sake
, let
me call back the young man.
No, cried Jacob, with a
stern
look,
stay
where
you are (for
she
was about to quit the room); the
youth has behaved
unseemly
,
refuses
the money which
I have tendered him, and lays claim to my whole
estate
.
And art thou
sure
, quite
sure
, Jacob Holmes,
said
she
, and her countenance
expressed
fear and doubt,
art thou quite
sure
that he has no lawful claim upon
thy property? In good truth, I thought he
spoke
as
though he were
assured
of his right.
Dinah,
said
Jacob, thou art a good woman;
thou
dost
understand
thy
household
concerns; they
are
sufficient
for the extent of thy capacity. I pray
thee, Dinah, trouble not
thyself
with what is beyond
thy
comprehension
. Thou art a
stranger
to the
world, totally unacquainted with the arts and
deceptions
with which it abounds.
Verily thou
sayest
right,
she
replied mildly, but
as I could not
assert
a
falsehood
without
hesitating
,
nor claim what was the right of another, without
blushing
,
I judged by the firm voice and
unembarrassed
manner of the young man.
If thou
didst
judge of him by
thyself
, Dinah,
said
her father, thou
didst
wrong.
Perhaps
so
, father; I am
simple
, and
uninstructed
.
But I hope I am not equally wrong in judging
of my
husband
's heart by my own; for I think,
Jacob
,
continued
she
, and
she
laid her hand
affectionately
on his arm, I think I would rather be poor and
honest
, than rich at the
cost
of another;
wouldst
not
thou, Jacob?
Jacob could not reply, nor even lift his eyes to the
face of his wife; he rather unkindly
shook
off the hand
she
had laid on his arm, and the child
just
then
beginning
to cry, he bade her take away the
noisy
boy,
for it
disturbed
him. Dinah obeyed in
silence
,
repaired
to a
distant
apartment, and as the infant drew
from her
bosom
life's
nourishing
fluid,
she
hung
fondly
over him and wept.
Our hero in the mean time returned to
Philadelphia
.
His mind was
harassed
, his
spirits
depressed
;
he endeavoured to
compose
himself
, and to form
some
plan for his future conduct; but, inexperienced as he
was, he wanted a friend to
advise
and direct him.
To-morrow,
said
he, I will deliver the letters I
brought with me.
Reuben was elegant in his appearance, though
perfectly
plain in his
dress
; but there was an air of
superiority
,
not pride or
self
-
consequence
; it was that
native
dignity of manner, which is ever
inspired
by
conscious
rectitude of heart and unimpeached integrity.
His
person
was
striking
, and what would in general be
termed
handsome
. It will naturally be
supposed
he
was therefore received with
politeness
, and would have
prepossessed
almost
every one in his favour, but that
almost
all whom he
conversed
with were prejudiced
persons
, who conceived that Jacob Holmes's
interest
had been much injured by the extravagance and folly
of his father.
From
several
to whom he delivered letters, (which
letters were nothing more than a
simple
annunciation
of his name and family) he received invitations to
their
houses
; but when his
circumstances
began to be
suspected
, and indeed the
openness
of his
disposition
led him rather to
expose
than endeavour to conceal
them; when it was
discovered
he wanted friends who
would be farther
serviceable
than merely giving him
a dinner, or a bed for a few nights; he found, by
their
distant
, frigid manner, that he was no longer
welcome, that he was thought an intruder. His
independent
spirit
took fire; he no longer
visited
, he
shut
himself
in his apartment, lived
sparingly
, and
revolved
a
thousand
different plans by which he hoped
to immerge from
obscurity
, and
rescue
from oblivion
the name of Dudley. He had applied to
several
professors
of the law to give him advice and
assistance
for
the recovery of his right; but his poverty was known
to be certain, his claims were
supposed
very doubtful;
no one would undertake the
cause
.
Can any
situation
be more
distressing
, than that of
a young man, of brilliant
understanding
,
aspiring
genius
,
laudable ambition and uncorrupted heart, thus
deprived of every means of improving his fortune,
or exerting his talents, in
such
a manner as might at
once be advantageous to
himself
and
society
in
general
?
In a large and
flourishing
town, without a friend,
without even an
associate
towards whom he felt the
smallest
degree of affection, how forlorn, how totally
devoid
of comfort were his days! A
solitary
individual,
who looked on the
surrounding
multitude, whom
business
or
pleasure
had drawn together, and
saw
not one
with whom the feelings of his
soul
could claim
kindred
,
not one who conceived or
commiserated
his
sufferings
,
or,
should
sickness
overtake him, would feel
interested
for his recovery, or drop a tear of regret
over his bier,
should
it
please
Heaven to put a period
to his
existence
.
Depressed
by his own
situation
, and tortured by
reflections
on what might
possibly
be the
distresses
of his
sister
, Reuben had not courage even to write to her.
Why
should
I torment her, he would
say
, by an
account of my ill
success
? Why write, when I have
not one comfortable idea to
transmit
? No, I will
suffer
her to
suppose
I am no more; my
silence
will
lead her to imagine I have paid the debt of nature.
She will grieve, but time will
soothe
and
lessen
her
affliction, which even at the
first
will not be half
so
poignant, as the knowledge of my
existing
in a
state
of
obscurity
, without money, without credit, without
friends would
occasion
.
Jessy
Oliver too, would
sometimes
intrude on his
thoughts; but he endeavoured to
banish
hopes, which,
spite
of
reason
, would often
arise
. She is
lost
to
me, he would
say
; I
shall
never
see
her more, or
should
I, will my ruined fortune entitle me to the hand
of a woman of her rank? But
Miss
Oliver is above
valuing a man for the paltry
distinctions
of wealth.
Then ought I not to repel, with the
utmost
force of
honour, every
selfish
passion
that would
inspire
a
wish
to degrade her by a union with my humble
destiny
?
These
were the hourly reflections of our hero.
Night came, and he,
cheerless
,
sought
the pillow of
repose
, courting oblivion in the arms of
sleep
. But
the
somnific
power was deaf to his
solicitations
; or if,
perchance, he paid a
transient
visit
,
sealing
his weary
eyes for a few hours, Memory,
still
wakeful, would
represent
past
scenes
, or fondly paint
illusive
present
joys.
Rachel and
Jessy
were the objects of his dreams.
Sometimes he
saw
his
sister
on the brink of a
precipice
,
from the edge of which a horrid
spectre
strove
to
precipitate her, when, as
she
fell,
Jessy
appeared with
arms extended to catch and
save
her from plunging
into the dreadful
abyss
that yamned beneath.
Sometimes
his fancy
represented
his
sister
and
Miss
Oliver
embarked in a
small
and ill-accommodated
vessel
, on a
tempestuous
ocean; the
sky
lowered, the winds
howled
,
and glaring meteors
shot
along the horizon; the
waves
rose
tremendous, broke on the little barque,
and
she
disappeared
. Then in a moment he
saw
the
fair form of
Jessy
leading his fainting
sister
up the
beach, when, as they
strove
to avoid the encroaching
tide, their feet would
slip
, and
succeeding
waves again
immerse
them in the foaming flood; and then again
an
instantaneous
change (for the
visions
of
sleep
are
wild and unconnected) would
represent
those
dear
objects
of his
fondest
solicitude
seated
in an arbour of
evergreens, twined round with myrtle flowers and
roses
. He
saw
them, talked to them;
sweet
smiling
infants
seemed
to play around them. Archibald
Oliver
too was there, and a
stranger
of noble mien. But
suddenly
some
new terror would
arise
; he
started
,
awoke, and all the
fascinating
vision
fled. Sleep thus
agitated and
disturbed
afforded but little
refreshment
,
and in a few weeks our hero was but the
shadow
of
his former
self
.
About this period the natives, who had been driven
back into the Allegany Mountains, and who had
pitched
their habitation, in different tribes, upon the
furthermost
banks of the
Susquehannah
, Allegany and
Mohawk rivers, made frequent
descents
into the new
settled
parts of the country, plundering, burning and
destroying
with impunity every European
settlement
within their reach.
In
consequence
of the treachery and rapacity of
these
savages
, it became
necessary
to
send
a military
force to repel them, and guard the lives and
properties
of the
inoffensive
settlers
; and Patrick Gordon,
Esq
. who at that time governed the colony,
proposed
raising
a volunteer company for this
service
. Proper
officers were accordingly appointed, and the company
increased
daily.
The
noise
this
occasioned
in the city awakened
Reuben
from his lethargy of
despondency
. The native
spark
of ambition, which had
so
long lain dormant,
was fanned to a flame, and with the
sanguine
ardour
ever
inseparable
from youth, vainly imagining to
deserve
was to
insure
preferment, he offered
himself
to the
Governor, and was accepted.
His candour in
speaking
of
himself
and
circumstances
;
his youth, his manners, his open,
unembarrassed
air, and intelligent, manly countenance,
spoke
volumes in his favour, and procured him the
honourable
appointment of
standard
bearer.
Early in the
spring
, they began their plan of
operations
,
and marched towards the margin of the
Susquehannah
.
During the
spring
and
summer
months,
they had
several
rencounters with the Indians, and
being
in general victorious, they had driven and
pursued
them a farther
distance
into the country than they
imagined, and the weather began to grow cold before
they thought of returning. At length the officers
having
unanimously
agreed that it would be
hazardous
,
as well as of little
use
, to
pursue
their retreating
soe
any farther, preparations were made for their
gaining
good quarters before the inclement
season
should
be too far advanced. The main body had began their
march, and our hero, (who was now promoted to the
rank of lieutenant) with a
small
party, was left to
follow
the next morning with the baggage.
Amongst
the party of which Reuben was
second
in
command, was an
Irish
youth, who particularly
attached
himself
to our hero. O'Neil was ignorant, but
honest
.
Like an
unpolished
diamond, his outward
appearance
was uncouth and rough; but within was a jewel
of
inestimable
price. Simplicity, integrity and
humanity
were the
characteristies
of his
soul
. This young
man was
so
pointed in his attentions to our hero, that
it could not
pass
unnoticed. One day, when he had
been voluntarily performing
some
little menial office,
Reuben thus
addressed
him:
By what good fortune, O'Neil, is it, that I am
so
particularly favoured with your kind offices?
Arrah, my
swate
master
,
said
O'Neil, by no
great matter of good fortune, only that your Honour
happened to have a father.
Did you know my father, O'Neil?
Och! and did you think I did not know him?
Many is the time I havent
served
him, to be
sure
; and
while Pat O'Neil lives, he will
serve
any that wears
the name of Dudley, for his
sake
; aye, by night or by
day, fair weather or foul, all's one for that. And did
you think now I could ever forget how he paid the
money for that
swate
crater, Madam Juliana, and how
he had her
nursed
, and
It now
struck
Reuben that he might, through
O'Neil, learn
some
further intelligence concerning a
circumstance
, which he had often thought of
since
the
information he received from Jael, on the
first
day of
his arrival; for he naturally
supposed
that the Juliana
he talked of was the unfortunate woman,
whose
sorrows
his father had alleviated. He put
several
questions
to his humble friend, and gleaned from him a
tale which cannot be better related than in his own
simple
language.
It was in dear Ireland,
said
he, about fifteen
miles from Dublin's
swate
city, that my honoured
master
had a
house
; I would tell you his name, but
that I can't,
because
, you
see
, I
promised
Madam
Juliana never to breathe a
syllable
of the matter. She
was all the child he had; and he thought
she
was too
good for the
sun
to
shine
on, and
so
she
was; but
she
was not quite
so
good neither, that is to
say
,
she
might
a done better than to
listen
to a
spallpeen
of a lord that
was an
Englishman
, only that he was born in Dublin.
So he
saw
her one day when
she
was riding out, and
he
spoke
to her, and rode home with her; and when
my
master
saw
who he was, he turned him out of the
house
, and never
asked
him into it; and I heard him
tell Madam Juliana at
supper
-time, that he was no
better
than he
should
be, an if he had
said
not half
so
good, he would have
said
more in his favour than he
deserved
. I was a boy,
please
your Honour, then,
and half a guinea tempted me to take a letter and give
it to her. Och! the remembrance of that makes my
heart ache very often; for if I had not been
so
easily
persuaded
, my good
master
and my
swate
lady might
a been alive and happy together now. So
she
did not
mind what her father
said
, but wrote to him, and met
him; and one evening he brought a
chaise
and four
horses
. It was after
sunset
, and the new moon gave
but little light;
so
she
said
, Patrick, will you walk
with me as far as the Mill-Bridge?
Now it was October, and the wind was
sharp
. So
says
I, `It is cold, my lady,'
says
I.
A little or
so
,
said
she
, and her voice
seemed
to
tremble. It is a little cold, Patrick, but here is
something
to keep you warm;
so
she
put a crown piece
into my hand. So we went out together, and as I
opened the gate,
she
turned and looked up at the
windows
of her father's
study
; for there was a big row of
trees from the
house
to the gate, and his
study
windows
were right
opposite
. So
she
looked at them,
B b
and lifted up her hands and wrung them, and I heard
her
sob
.
You had better go back,
Miss
,
said
I; but
she
made me no
answer
, only walked very
fast
forward;
and when I
saw
the lord and the
chaise
, my mind
misgave
me, and I
said
, Och!
Miss
July, what are you
going to be after doing?
Do not be frightened, my good lad,
said
she
,
but go back and take this letter to my father.
Go back?
said
I, no! no! Pat O'Neil does
no
such
thing; I could not bear to
see
my poor old
master
die of the heart-break, or go crazy for your
loss
.
But you
must
go back,
said
the lord.
But I won't,
said
I; I will follow my
mistress
to the end of the world, and farther too if needs
must
.
Och! your Honour, I cannot tell how I felt when
I thought they were going away without me. He
had lifted my poor lady in, who
seemed
almost
dying;
so
I caught hold of her gown, and hung upon the
step
of the
chaise
, and
swore
never to quit my hold till
my hands were cut off.
Let him go with us, poor fellow,
said
my lady.
He will betray us,
said
the lord.
No, I will not,
said
I; let me go with my
mistress
, and I will not
speak
a word to nobody; but
I will protect her, fight for her, die for her.
Get up behind,
said
he.
I
sprung
up in a giffey, and away we went. Well,
that night we went aboard a packet, and failed away
to England, and there a Roman Catholic
priest
married
them; but the
false
-hearted lord never meant the
thing that was right all this while; for in a week or
two he grew cool, and at
last
told her he was no
Catholic
,
and therefore not her
husband
, and that to
provide
for her during her life, he had got her a
husband
,
and when
she
was married,
she
might go back to her
father. So a captain
used
to come with him, and I
don't know how they managed; but Madam Juliana
was married to him, and I thought the next day
she
would have gone
distracted
. She tore her beautiful
flaxen hair, and wrung her hands, and cried and
sobbed
.
So then, in a little while her
husband
went away
over
sea
, and then after Madam lay in,
she
followed
him, and when
she
came to Philadelphia, he would not
own her, and
she
pined and pined, till at
last
Here the voice of poor O'Neil failed. His
honest
heart
burst
forth at his eyes.
Spare
yourself
, Patrick,
said
Reuben, for I think
I know the
rest
.
Not quite all, your Honour,
said
Patrick; for
on the day before
she
died, your good father, Heaven
bless
him for it, let me
see
her. She was
almost
gone,
and
spoke
so
low, I could
scarce
hear her.
Patrick,
said
she
, I want to thank you for your
steady
attachment to me. I would fain leave you
something
as a remembrance; but I have nothing
left of any value.
My dear,
swate
, angel lady,
said
I, you will
leave me the remembrance of your precious
self
. I
never! no, never!
shall
forget you.
I
sent
for you,
said
she
, to tell you, Patrick,
that,
should
you ever
see
my father, he may know from
you that I have been
punished
,
justly
, I own, though
very
severely
, for my
disobedience
to the
best
of parents.
I leave my child an orphan, in a
strange
land; but
my benefactor has
promised
to take care of it. You,
I know, will, to the
utmost
of your power, protect it.
She fainted before
she
had
finished
; they took me
out of the room, and I never
saw
her again. Och!
your Honour,
she
is
surely
in heaven; for to die
heart-broken
,
and in poverty, in a
strange
land, without any
friendsDo you not think
she
is in heaven? do you
not think her
sins
were pardoned?
We will hope
so
,
said
Reuben; but
disobedience
to parents is certainly a deep offence
against
the
commandments of our Creator.
But
she
was very penitent,
said
O'Neil. Reuben
was
silent
.
After this
conversation
, there
seemed
a kind of
social
bond formed between Reuben and the young
Irishman
;
the latter performing all the offices of a
servant
,
the other
practising
all the
kindness
and benevolence
of the
best
of
masters
. The autumn nights were cold;
O'Neil would watch till he
saw
our hero in a
slumber
,
then, adding his own blanket to the
slight
covering of
Reuben's bed, he would wrap
himself
as well as he
could in his great coat, and lie down on the ground
beside
him.
The baggage being placed in order ready for an
early march, the
soldiers
and officers were retired to
rest
. O'Neil had, as
usual
, thrown his blanket over
his
master
(as he delighted to call him) and the air
being more than
usually
sharp
, he found it
impossible
to
sleep
. He
arose
, and raking together the dying
embers
of a fire by which they had
dressed
their
supper
,
began to re-kindle it. As he was thus employed, he
thought he heard a
rustling
amongst
the trees; and
turning half round, perceived, by the
saint
light the
fire
cast
around, the faces of two Indians peeping from
behind a large tree. He gave a loud cry; the
Indians
uttered the war whoop; a
scene
of
confusion
and
horror
ensued
, and in a few moments part of the little
corps were
slain
, the
rest
wounded and made
prisoners
.
Amongst
the latter was our hero, and his faithful
adherent, Patrick O'Neil.
CHAP. XIII.
Another
Visit
to
savage
Habitations.
There
had,
some
little time previous to this
event, been
several
of the Indian chiefs taken
prisoners
by the Europeans, and it was to this
circumstance
those
, who were taken
prisoners
by the natives,
owed the
preservation
of their lives, as the
savages
entertained
hopes that by means of
these
they might
procure the liberty of their captured brethren.
Their route lay
across
the country, and before they
had reached their place of
destination
, a very heavy
fall of
snow
rendered the woods
almost
impenetrable;
but the Indians, inured from their infancy to cold,
hunger, every
species
of
hardship
, felt little or no
inconvenience
from the
severity
of the
season
,
whilst
the
Europeans
sunk
under their accumulated
sufferings
;
and of twelve who were taken
prisoners
,
seven
died by
the way.
Reuben had been
slightly
wounded, and O'Neil had
received a
scratch
, as he called it, in endeavouring to
preserve
his
master
, from the tomahawk of an Indian.
But Reuben was by nature intrepid, and O'Neil was
callous to every calamity that affected only
himself
.
They mutually comforted and
supported
each other,
and were
amongst
the few who
survived
at the end of
their
wearisome
,
pedestrain
journey.
The morning after their arrival at the Indian
settlement
,
the five
surviving
captives were
presented
to the
sachem
, Wampoogohoon. His wigwam was larger
and more commodious than
those
of his
subjects
. It
was well lined with
skins
of various wild
beasts
, and
on a kind of throne, covered with the
same
materials,
sat
the
sachem
. At his left hand
sat
a woman,
whose
complexion
spoke
her of European
descent
, and behind
them
stood
a young female, in appearance about
seventeen
years old. Her
skin
was a
shade
darker than
that of the woman's; her eyes were of that kind of
dark grey, which may
almost
be termed blue, and yet,
from the
shade
of long black
eyelashes
, may
sometimes
be
mistaken
for black. Their
expression
was at once
soft
and animated, and her dark auburn hair, which
did not really curl, but hung in waves down her back
and over her
shoulders
, was ornamented with a few
glass
beads, and a tuft of
scarlet
feathers,
sancifully
arranged, and not entirely devoid of
taste
. The
rest
of her
dress
, though greatly
similar
to the other
women
,
had a
something
of delicacy, in its formation and
method of being put on, that was particularly
pleasing
to Europeans. Her figure was above the middle
size
, yet not
robust
enough to be thought
masculine
,
though every feature glowed with ruddy health, every
limb
displayed
the
strength
and
firmness
of her frame.
B b 2
She
stood
with her right hand leaning on the
sachem
's
shoulder
, in her left
she
held an unbraced bow, and a
quiver full of arrows was
slung
across
her back.
Wampoogohoon received the captives with a kind
of
sullen
dignity. He
spoke
to them in very bad
English
,
but they
understood
sufficient
to comprehend
that he mean to detain them till the captured Indians
were returned in
safety
.
During the time he was
speaking
, Reuben looked
attentively at the two women, who from their places,
and the
universal
respect
paid them, he concluded
were the wife and daughter of the chief. The
pensiveness
manifest
in the countenance of the elder, the
beauty
and
majesty
of the younger, awakened in his
bosom
a
wish
to be acquainted with their
story
; for he was
certain they were of European extraction, though of
what nation he could not determine, as they had neither
of them
spoke
.
At length, when the conference was ended, and the
sachem
waved his hand for them to depart, his wife
arose
, and
spoke
to him in the Mohawk tongue.
Reuben
perceived, from the
soft
tone of her voice and her
earnest
manner, that it was a
supplication
. He
answered
,
but not with the
gentlest
accent;
she
laid her
hand on his arm, and repeated her
request
, in which
she
was joined by Eumea, his daughter. He looked
irresolute
for a moment, then
seeming
to
acquiesce
in
their demands, arofe from his
seat
, and taking his bow
and arrows, was followed by his attendants out of the
wigwam.
The two
interesting
females now came forward,
and the
eldest
,
whose
name was Victoire,
addressed
our
hero in very tolerable French:
Stranger, I am
sorry
for your captivity, though
my
situation
amongst
these
Indians makes me appear
your enemy.
Yourself
and companions are no doubt
surprised
, to
see
a
person
of my complexion
so
intimately
connected with one of theirs; my
story
may
be told in a few words. My mother, a native of
France, being of a
protestant
family, and
apprehending
persecution
, emigrated to this new-found world,
in company with her
husband
, a man of
strict
piety
and principles. Their portion of worldly goods was
not large; they
purchased
a wild, uncultivated
spot
upon the borders of the Allegany, and by five years
of
indesatigable
labour, rendered their little hut and
surrounding
garden, together with one field, tolerably
comfortable; but
just
when they began to
taste
some
small
degree of
happiness
, which would
searcely
have
deserved
the name, but by being
contrasted
with the
excess
of
hardship
they had endured in clearing and
rendering their little
demesne
fit for cultivation; then,
at the moment when they hoped to reap the reward of
their labours, a party of Mohawks came down upon
them, rifled and
destroyed
their dwelling, murdered
my father and two little brothers, and carried my
wretched mother and
myself
, then only a year old,
into
captivity.
Victoire
paused
;
she
seemed
affected; a tear
glistened
in the
expressive
eyes of Eumea. At length the
former proceeded:
My mother was a convincing proof of the
excess
of
misery
the human mind can
suffer
;
she
survived
the
loss
of a
husband
tenderly beloved, and two
children
.
I was her comfort, her
stay
, which held her to
this world; for my
sake
she
bore captivity without
murmuring, for my
sake
she
wished
and
strove
to
preserve
her
existence
;
she
lived till I was fourteen years
old, and gave me every
instruction
which memory
furnished
,
for
she
had no
assistance
from books. She
instilled
into my young mind a knowledge and love of
a
supreme
, benignant Being, and taught me to place my
whole dependence on him,
whose
goodness
was equal
to his power.
Wampoogohoon was the
youngest
son
of the
sachem
,
who at that time governed this tribe; he
offered
me his protection. My mother, in a dying
state
,
rather than leave me
exposed
to
insult
,
advised
me to
accede to his
proposal
, and I became his wife. His
father and brothers are
since
dead, and you behold
him a chief of the Mohawks. He is not unkind to
me, and as the father of my children, I feel an
affection
for him. Eumea is the only
surviving
child I
have of
six
; for her
sake
, I
wish
for
some
intercourse
with the Europeans, that her mind, which is not a
barren
soil
, may receive the culture of education. To
this end, I have
requested
my
husband
to permit you
to have a wigwam to
yourselves
, where you may dwell
in quiet, till we hear of the
safety
of
those
Indians who
have been detained by your party. In return, I only
request
you to exert your abilities to
instruct
, in your
language,
customs
, manners and religion, my child
Eumea.
Saying this,
she
presented
the Indian maid to
Reuben
,
who
assured
Victoire he would do all in his
power
to return the obligation
she
had conferred.
He was then, with his companions,
shewn
to a
habitation
that wore a trifling appearance of comfort; in
it were three or four bear
skins
, a quantity of clean
dry
straw
,
some
dried
fish
,
venison
and maize, and
without was plenty of fuel.
Here our hero indulged
himself
in reflection; and
often would his thoughts revert to his grandfather,
William Dudley, who was for many years in a
situation
somewhat
similar
. But Reuben had
seen
too much
of
savage
men and manners to have a
wish
to remain
amongst
them, even though he might have been
elevated
to the
highest
seat
of dignity.
It was at once a comfort and
amusement
to
Reubeh
,
that he was obliged, for
several
hours every day,
to employ his mind, in order to cultivate that of his
pupil Eumea. He contrived, by boiling the
shumak
berries, to make a liquid with which he could write on
white birch bark. In this manner, he made an
alphabet
,
which
she
presently
learnt; and
seeming
to
delight
in attending to his
instructions
, he experienced a
double
satisfaction
in endeavouring to expand and
inform
her
understanding
. She was
soon
able to read
short
sentences
, which he
composed
for her; his hand
being generally employed, and his mind often totally
occupied in
striving
to recollect what might be of the
most
service
to his lovely
scholar
, he had little time for
reflection.
O'Neil laboured
incessantly
to keep their dwelling
warm and tight; and
sometimes
he went out with his
gun, and brought home
some
kind of game which
served
to
diversisy
their
scanty
repasts
; and often
Victoire
would accompany her daughter to their wigwam,
and on
those
occasions
generally carried
something
which they thought a delicacy,
such
as noa-cake,
omanny, or
succatash
, viands
composed
of maize and
dried beans; and thus wore away a very long and
intensely
severe
winter. Reuben had been a
prisoner
above
six
months, and yet no news had arrived that
could
raise
his hopes of
speedy
liberation; and we
must
leave him
amongst
these
children of nature, and
return to our heroine, whom we left married to
Hamden
Auberry, but living in the vicinity of
Mary-lebone
,
under the
assumed
name of Dacres.
CHAP. XIV.
ScandalSeparation
Jealousy
.
It
has been already remarked, that Rachel had as
little
curiosity
in her
composition
as any woman
existing
:
she
was
also
by nature of a retired, quiet
turn of mind, though
easily
led into
scenes
of
dissipation
,
in which, as
she
generally mixed to gratify
others
,
she
took but little
satisfaction
. She therefore
spent
the chief of her time at home, either employed
at her needle, or reading. Hamden was fond of
music
;
he had procured her a
spinnet
and a
master
. She
had a
considerable
taste
for drawing; Hamden was
a proficient in the art; he directed and improved her
judgment; pointed out proper
subjects
for the
exercise
of her genius, and with her book, her pencil, her
necdle
,
music
, and
some
few
domestic
concerns,
she
so
sweetly
diversified
her time, that not one moment
hung heavy on her hands. Indeed, Rachel had, from
her childhood, been taught that
most
useful
, and to
those
who
practise
it, that
most
pleasant
of all
lessons
,
constant
employment; that it is better to be engaged
in trifling
pursuits
(if innocent) than
suffer
the mind
to
sink
into inanity for want of
exercise
.
Hamden remained in London about a month or
six
weeks after their marriage. He then left her to return
to his aunt, who was
still
in Scotland; and at the
time he bade his dear Rachel adieu, he
purposed
returning
to her within the
space
of two months.
After the departure of her
husband
, our heroine
continued the
same
regular
course
of life. But
calumny
,
who has a hundred ears, a
thousand
eyes, and ten
thousand
tongues, not one of which is ever
suffered
to
slumber
for an
instant
, could not permit her to enjoy
her favourite and
inoffensive
employment
unmolested
.
Though Rachel had imagined that the uniform
tenor
of her conduct was
such
, as might defy even the
prying eyes of malice and envy, yet
she
felt there
was
something
wrong in her appearance. She went
by an
assumed
name; yet, confident that
she
was in
reality the wife of Aubevry
she
also
felt that though
she
had
transgressed
the bounds of prudence,
she
had
strictly
adhered to the rules of virtue and morality;
and this internal
assurance
gave her great comfort.
And when retiring for the night,
she
would reflect
that her heart was in
universal
charity with all her
fellow-creatures, that her
pursuits
were altogether
harmless
, and in
some
degree laudable; a
sweet
serenity
would
diffuse
itself
through her
bosom
, and
offering
up her prayers for the
safety
of her beloved
Reuben, and her
almost
adored
husband
,
she
would
sink
into a
slumber
, as
composed
and
refreshing
as her
own mind was pure and uncontaminated.
The heart that is
itself
a
stranger
to guilt
suspects
it not in another. Such was the heart of Rechel;
without
enthusiasm
pious, without oftentation
charitable
,
and innatcly virtuous, without an idea that there
was any particular merit in being
so
;
since
, without
being
insensible
to the inevitable
misery
that
must
and
ever will follow the forfeiture of that
inestimable
jewel,
chastity
,
she
wondered how
so
many
heedless
women
fell into an error
so
repugnant to her own feelings.
As Major Auberry was certain he could not remain
long with his wife, when he
secured
her a
handsome
and
convenient place of
residence
, he was not forgetful of the
pleasure
that would naturally
result
from a companion
of her own
sex
being under the
same
roof with her. In his
search
after lodgings or a ready
furnished
house
, chance
directed him to Mrs. Varnice, the widow of an attorney,
whose
pride would not
suffer
her to leave the
house
her
husband
had engaged but a
short
time before his
death, and who would, to
support
that pride, (the real
origin of which was
meanness
, not real dignity of
soul
)
submit
to any thing but labour.
At the time Major Auberry applied for the upper
part of her
house
,
she
knew him, and that his name
was not Dacres. But he will pay me well,
said
she
mentally;
so
she
concealed her knowledge, and
agreed to our heroine's becoming the
mistress
of the
apartments.
When Rachel was
first
introduced to her,
she
observed
her lovely,
majestic
form, and
sweetly
intersting
countenance. Mrs. Varnice was
short
, rather too
much
em bon point
, dark complexioned, and on the
wrong
side
of forty; but her eyes, which were of jetty
hue, and
whose
brilliancy
she
endeavoured to
increase
by an artful tinge of rouge on her high cheek-bones,
were animated and
expressive
, and
she
was not
without
hope that
some
future
conquest
might
secure
to her
a
second
matrimonial
establishment
. To
such
a
woman
,
the
first
appearance of our heroine was by no
means
prepossessing
.
She is certainly
handsome
(
said
she
, on the day
Rachel took
possession
of her new lodgings)
she
is
handsome
, I
must
own; but your pretty women have
seldom
much to recommend them
besides
their
beauty
.
This remark was made to a poor relation, who
was dependent on Mrs. Varnice for bread; an
unfortunate
being, who, from want of education, and
extreme
poverty,
possessed
a mind as abject as her
circumstances
.
Education,
spirit
of light, being of the
first
order,
who in thy right hand
dost
hold a magic mirror,
displaying
to the
astonished
sense
of youth the wondrous,
fascinating
charms of nature; who,
still
receding as
we
pursue
, yet
still
displaying
something
strange
and
charming,
invitest
the admiring pupil
still
to follow;
whose
left hand holds a tablet, on which is written all
that was learnt from thy
instructive
mirror; who as
thou
passest
, giving place to age, who hangs his head
and droops that thou
canst
charm no more,
presentest
the tablets, whence fond memory gleans
something
to
cheer the
last
cold eve of life, and being
transmitted
to the
rising
age, incite them to attend thy
earliest
call,
follow thee through thy
most
intricate labyrinths, that,
as thou
dost
ascend
the hill of fame, holding before
them
still
the
instructive
glass

Rachel had received a good, though not a brilliant
education; her mind was therefore free from
prejudice
.
Mrs. Varnice and her
cousin
Lettuce were
totally
uncultivated, and
superstition
and prejudice were
easily
admitted and encouraged. The former of
these
women, therefore, concluded our heroine to be a
deluded
victim to inexperience and affection. She
thought the infatuation (as
she
called it) of Hamden
would not
last
long, and
wisely
imagined, by paying
the
most
marked attention to him, by giving up her
own opinion whenever it was in
opposition
to his, and
in a hundred different forms, which
she
conceived to
be the height of
complaisance
, but which to Auberry
himself
appeared to have partook more of abject
servility
,
to
supplant
her in his good opinion;
however
,
as he imagined her, in the main, a
good-natured
,
inossensive
woman, he encouraged her
advances
to an intimacy with Rachel. He knew the
purity of our heroine's mind, and native good
sense
would prevent her receiving any ill
impressions
, or
contracting
any low ideas from
conversing
with a woman
every way
so
infinitely her inferior, and at the
same
time thought her knowledge of the world might guard
the inexperienced Rachel from
impositions
.
If the
first
fight of our heroine awakened in the
bosom
of Mrs. Varnice the malignant fiend envy, her
manners and
conversation
assisted
to heighten it, and
in
less
than a fortnight Mrs. Varnice pronounced her
to be proud, conceited,
foolish
, in
short
, every thing
that was the direct
opposite
to her real
disposition
.
Yet
she
concealed her opinion, and would take
opportunities
to admire her
understanding
,
praise
her
shape
,
her complexion, even the tone of her voice. Rachel
was not greedy of flattery; but where is the human
being that can at all times turn a deaf ear to its
adulating
voice, or
steel
their hearts to its
insinuating
qualities?
When Anberry left his wife to go to his aunt in
Scotland, Mrs. Varnice had not an idea that he meant
to return, and felt
somewhat
mortified that all her arts
to attract his notice had proved ineffectual; but as
she
found it would be to no
use
to repine,
she
turned her
thoughts to what advantage might be made of our
heroine.
The parting between Major Auberry and his lady
had been extremely painful on both
sides
. Rachel's
heart
sunk
within her, and as the
chaise
drove from
the door, her emotions became
so
violent, that Mrs.
Varnice was obliged to lead her into her own parlour,
and give her a
glass
of drops and water.
Come, come, my dear Madam,
said
she
, as
Rachel
endeavoured to
suppress
her tears, you
must
not give way to this immoderate
sorrow
; Mr. Dacres,
I dare
say
, will
soon
come back again; I
suppose
he
is not gone very far.
Four hundred miles,
said
Rachel, appears to
me an
immense
distance
; and I know not how to
account
for it, but I feel
such
an
oppression
at my heart,
it
seems
as though I had beheld him for the
last
time,
and yet I know he will return as early as
possible
.
C c
O! to be
sure
he will; he
promised
to come back
soon
, did not he?
He will come as
soon
as he can, I know; but the
length of his
stay
does not depend entirely on
himself
.
However, he has
promised
I
should
hear from him
very often, and I
shall
count the moments with
impatience
till I can hope to receive a letter. I have been
very
troublesome
to you, Madam, continued
she
,
rising
to quit the parlour; pray pardon my
childish
behaviour; I will retire and endeavour to attain
fortitude
to bear this
first
(and I hope in Heaven it will
be the
last
)
separation
.
Her eyes filled again as
she
spoke
, and
courtesying
hastily
,
she
repaired to her own apartment; and
having
disburthened
her heart by giving a free
course
to
her tears,
she
composed
her
spirits
; and
asserting
that
understanding
which was ever ready at her call,
she
began to employ
herself
on a piece of embroidery, the
pattern for which was drawn by Hamden; from that
she
went to her
spinnet
, and played as well as
she
could
a trifling air which he had taught her.
These
employments
amused
and
soothed
her. She became
composed
,
and determined, during this enforced and
painful
absence
, to occupy
herself
in acquiring
those
accomplishments
which
she
knew would be
most
agreeable
to her
husband
. Every trace of the primitive
puritan
was now entirely
abolished
, except that
she
was
extremely neat in her
dress
, and
simple
in her
manners
.
She followed
fashion
as far as
she
thought it
consistent
with propriety, but no farther; and though
strangers
would pronounce her perfectly elegant at
the
first
glance, were they to
scrutinize
the
several
articles
that
composed
her apparel, they would be at a
loss
to
say
what particularly
constituted
that elegance.
In
short
, Rachel was the kind of woman who gives
taste
and
fashion
to every thing
she
wears, however
plain its formation, however common the materials of
which it is made.
The
state
of her mind, after the departure of her
husband
was
such
, as precluded every idea of
seeking
society
during the day. She attempted, but the
attempt
was vain, to partake of a meal which the care
of Lettuce had provided (for Lettuce had performed
the office of attendant on the
person
of our heroine
from the
first
day of her
residence
in the
house
of Mrs.
Varnice); but towards evening
she
began to reflect,
that the
solicitude
and attention of her
hostess
demanded
some
return;
she
therefore
requested
she
would
come and take tea in her apartment.
It was now the middle of October, and the twilight
at that period
soon
closes
; it was
six
o'clock, when
the tea things were placed on the table; a cheerful
fire illumined the hearth, two wax candles lent their
rays to enliven the
scene
, the windows were
closed
,
the curtains let down, and perfect
silence
reigned in
the apartments. The
house
was as retired as though
twenty miles from London, and not a
sound
interupted
the tranquillity of the
surrounding
scene
,
save
now
and then the rattle of a
solitary
carriage
passing
to and
from the environs of the city.
If there is a moment in which the human mind is
more inclined to unbend, and place an unlimited
confidence
in
those
who
profess
a
friendship
, it is, when
fully comprehending the charms of
solitude
, we find
that
solitude
may be enlivened by being participated
by one who enters into all our feelings, and
smiles
or
weeps as the colour of our fate or
expression
of our
sentiments
excites the
opposite
emotions. Such was
the moment we have
just
described
, nor was our
heroine
insensible
to its influence.
I am glad to
see
you
so
much recovered,
said
Mrs. Varnice,
seating
herself
at the tea-table, and
drawing the tea-board towards her, which Lettuce
had
just
brought in;
shall
I
save
you the trouble and
make the tea?
Rachel acknowledged her
goodness
, and
acquiesced
in the
proposal
.
I
suppose
Mr. Dacres,
said
she
with a
sigh
, is
now many miles
distant
from me; and
suppose
he
writes at the
first
post
town, when may I expect to
hear from him?
That I cannot tell,
said
the artful Mrs. Varnice,
unless
I knew what road he took.
The High North-road.
Well, you may hear from him
sooner
, but I do not
imagine he will write till he gets to York. He is a
beautiful man, taking a miniature in her hand that
hung by a ribbon round Rachel's neck, a very
handsome
man indeed; and I think there is
something
in
your countenances very much alike, very much
indeed
,
just
about the eyes and the mouth; that pretty
dimple,
just
at the left corner. Well, you were
certainly
relations.
No indeed, we were not, I never
saw
him till
within eight months of our union.
Indeed! Well, I could have
sworn
you had been
cousins
. Where were you married, in London?
In
Westminster
.
In
Westminster
? what at the Abbey?
No.
At St. James's Church?
No.
Oh! you were married at St. Margaret's?
No, I was not.
Bless
me, then what church was it?
Pardon me, I am not at liberty to
say
.
Mrs. Varnice
smiled
. Ah! I
understand
now;
it was a
stolen
match?
Not entirely
so
.
What, I
suppose
your friends knew it?
I have no friends in England.
None?
No, not one. I have a brother, a dear,
respectable
,
worthy brother; but he is in America.
In America? Dear me; what all
amongst
the
blacks and the wild Indians?
Rachel could not
suppress
an inclination to
smile
,
whilst
she
answered
, No, Madam,
amongst
the
European
settlers
, who have, within the
last
century,
emigrated
into the new world, which I
understand
is a
fertile continent extending from north to
south
, and
constituting
one entire quarter of the habitable globe.
And
so
, your brother is gone over
sea
to
those
strange
parts. And what could tempt him to leave
dear little England?
To inquire after property my father left there.
Dear well, how odd! And
so
your father died
abroad.
No, he was
lost
on his
passage
home, even when
in
sight
of his native
shores
.
Oh dear! how unfortunate! So you have no
friends in London?
In London? No, nor in England, except my
husband
.
Dear me! Well, I hope he will prove a faithful,
good
husband
to you.
I have no doubt of his faith or
tenderness
.
Oh dear no! I dare
say
not; though men are
strange
,
inconstant
beings, will
profess
much without
meaning any thing, marry women under
assumed
names, and never care for them after a little while.
There may have been
such
things,
said
Rachel;
but for the honour of human nature, I could
wish
not to believe them
possible
till my
senses
convince
me.
Sweet innocent! I
wish
you may never be
convinced
,
said
Mrs. Varnice pointedly.
This exclamation awakened
something
in the
bosom
of Rachel, that could not rightly be termed either
jealousy
or
curiosity
, but it was a mixture of both; and
the artful Varnice led her on, till
she
had gleaned from
Rachel (only that names were concealed) every
circumstance
relating to
herself
, her brother and her
husband
.
After a day or two
past
in that kind of
uncomfortable
,
unconnected manner, which every
person
of
sensibility
must
have experienced when
separated
from the
chosen
friend of their hearts, Rachel began again to
resume
her
usual
avocations. Her needle employed
the
earliest
hours of morning, after which
she
dressed
,
and walked into the fields for air and
exercise
. Her
dinner
past
,
she
employed the intermediate hours
between
that and evening with a book, her pencil, or a
lesson
on her
spinnet
; and the evenings were
usually
passed
in reading to,
conversing
and working, or
playing
picquet with, Mrs. Varnice.
C c 2
But during this period, it
must
not be imagined
that
she
was entirely forgotten by her quondam friends,
the
Websters
. They had been indefatigable in their
inquiries, till they found out her lodgings, and hearing
that
she
went by the name of Dacres, they were
persuaded
that
she
had forgot the
respect
due to
herself
,
and become the
mistress
of Hamden Auberry.
Mr. Spriggins, though at
first
mortified and
disappointed
by her
sudden
departure from his aunt's
house
,
soon
found
consolation
, by transferring his devoirs to
his
eldest
cousin
, by whom they were very favourably
received; and an old uncle having left him a decent
house
,
shop
and
stock
in trade, in a market town in
Northumberland, he
soon
obtained the
assent
of Mrs.
Webster
, and took her fair daughter, to
shine
forth in
all the airs and finery of a London bride, and to
set
the
fashions
for three months to come, to all the
tradesmen's
wives and daughters in a little country town.
His
shop
too was newly painted and decorated in the
London
style
, and Mr. Spriggins
himself
was
so
polite
,
so
obliging, that he
soon
attracted a large
number
of
customers
.
Beginning the world thus, not only without
embarrassments
,
but with a
small
sum
of ready money in
hand, this young couple found, in a very
short
time,
that they were in a fair way to accumulate a fortune.
The wife, though proud, vain, and fond of finery, was
meanly
parsimonious
, and would
stint
her family in
necessaries
, in order to buy a finer gown, or give a
more
expensive
treat than her neighbours. Belle
Webster
was
sent
for to be her companion, and
set
her cap at
some
of the
smart
young men, in hopes of
an
establishment
for life; while little Polly was left to
assist
and
console
her mother for the
loss
of her two
eldest
daughters.
When Hamden Auberry reached his uncle's
seat
,
he was received with
such
affectionate tokens of joy
by lady Anne, that he was
almost
tempted, in that
moment of
tenderness
, to throw
himself
on her mercy,
and
confess
his marriage. Happy had it been, both
for
himself
and our heroine, had he followed the
impulse
;
but he took time to
consider
, and that
false
pride, which was his only foible,
represented
to him,
that he was
secure
of the
person
and heart of Rachel,
bound to her by the
most
irrevocable vows; he
hazarded
nothing, therefore, by longer concealment. But
to avow his engagements with a woman in
respect
to
rank and fortune
so
diametrically
opposite
to what
lady
Anne
desired
, might forfeit her regard forever;
nay, this very pride flattered him that it was for the
sake
of his wife he
still
wished
to conceal their union,
and that the wealth and
consequence
in lady Anne's
power to
bestow
were only valued by him, as, by
possessing
them, he could elevate the woman of his choice
to a rank
she
was born to adorn. Alas! this was
false
reasoning
; it was in reality an
unwillingness
to
give up the
respect
, the parade, the
ease
and
conveniencies
,
wealth is ever certain to
insure
.
Two days after his arrival in Scotland, the family
were
surprised
by the
sudden
and unexpected
appearance
of lady Lucy. The tour to the continent had
been
shortened
by an untoward incident, and
she
having
,
on her return, landed at Harwich,
she
proceeded
immediately north, without going to London. Lady
Anne was not
displeased
by the return of her niece;
she
looked upon Hamden as the certain
successor
to
the title and
estates
of his late grandfather, but
she
thought a union with lady Lucy might by no means
retard the completion of her
wishes
, which were to
see
him at the head of her family.
It was the evening after the arrival of this lady,
that,
sitting
in a family way with only her aunt and
cousin
,
and diverting them with her vivacity and innocent
prattle, when, turning
suddenly
to Hamden,
she
cried,
Oh! by the bye, Coz, how does your pretty Quaker
girl do?
Hamden's face was but a trifle paler than his coat.
He
hesitated
, attempted to
answer
; but finding
himself
at a
loss
for words, affected a laugh.
You may laugh, cried
she
, but I declare I
thought her very pretty.
Who are you
speaking
of?
said
lady Anne,
fixing her eyes on the glowing face of Hamden.
Oh! he knows, continued the
thoughtless
girl,
and now I have the
scene
full in my mind, I'll tell
you, aunt. You
must
know we went to the play.
Nay, dear Lucy,
said
Hamden, gaily catching
her hand, how can you remember
such
ridiculous
trifles?
Your
servant
,
cousin
Hamden; it was no trifle
at the time. Now, aunt, I'll tell you how it was.
Between the play and farce, I had
observed
a very
pretty,
interesting
Quaker, who
sat
in the pit looking
very
earnestly
at Mr. Hamden. I
suppose
she
had
seen
him before. Eh,
cousin
?Well, dear aunt, the
house
was very full, and the pretty Quaker fainted;
when behold ye, my gentleman here takes a leap over
the front of the box, and
rushing
through the crowd,
flew to her
assistance
. But if you had
seen
when
she
recovered
A little moderation, if you
please
, lady Lucy,
cried Hamden, eagerly interrupting her; you paint
the
scene
in
such
lively colours, that my aunt will
suppose
the bagatelle of
consequence
.
And your manner, Hamden, does not contradict
the
supposition
,
said
lady Anne pointedly. Pray
who was this fainting
damsel
?
It was a
Miss
Dudley,
said
Hamden, in a
hurried
accent; I was introduced to her when I
last
visited
my mother.
Indeed!
said
lady Anne,
sarcastically
.
Yes,
she
was a great favourite of my mother's;
but I
understand
she
is lately married to an old crony
of mine, one Dacres. I am
sure
, aunt, you
must
remember
what friends Tom Dacres and I were when
boys.
And are you friends now?
said
Lucy with a
half
smile
and a
sly
glance at her aunt.
Lady Anne was
struck
with the evident
embarrassment
of Hamden;
she
therefore put an end to the
conversation
by
rising
and
desiring
him to attend her
to her
closet
. Here a
conversation
ensued
, which
convinced
Auberry, that the moment his aunt
should
be
assured
of his having formed a family connexion with
our heroine, would be the
last
of her favour.
I
must
dissemble
longer,
said
he. Alas!
dissimulation
is
seldom
necessary
, can never be laudable,
and was in this
case
despicable
.But we will
return
to our heroine.
The
first
six
weeks of her
husband
's
absence
she
bore
with tolerable patience; when a month more
passed
over, and no hope of his return,
she
murmured at the
delay; but when, at
last
, week after week glided on,
and Auberry did not appear,
she
began to
despond
.
Mrs Varnice was not
surprised
; it was what
she
had
expected. She by flow and
almost
imperceptible
degrees
endeavoured to undermine the principles of our
heroine; but Rachel, though not quick at
discerning
evil (
because
almost
a
stranger
to its baneful qualities)
at
last
discovered
her aim, and
repulsed
her with the
scorn
she
merited.
But innocence is ever inadequate to
oppose
, with any
degree of
success
, the united powers of envy and
cunning
.
In revenge for the contempt with which
she
had been treated, Mrs. Varnice
suppressed
the next
letter with which Lettuce was
entrusted
to carry to
the
post
, opened, read it, and committed it to the fire.
By the tenor of this letter,
she
comprehended that
Rachel
fully believed
herself
the wife of Auberry; but this
she
knew before, and inwardly laughed at what
she
supposed
to be the credulity of a fond,
unsuspecting
girl.
Having once began to interrupt the
correspondence
,
she
did not
hesitate
the next
post
-night to make
Lettuce
keep watch at the
street
door, and prevent the
rap of the
post
-man, which would have immediately
called our heroine down
stairs
. The
stratagem
succeeded
;
she
took the expected letter from the
postman's
hand, paid the
postage
, and retired to her own
apartment to read it.
It has often been
said
, that envy is its own
punisher
,
and in this
case
the adage was completely verified; for
when from this letter
she
discovered
that Hamden
really
was, and freely acknowledged
himself
, the
husband
of our heroine, her heart overflowed with
rancour
,
and
she
determined to
hesitate
at nothing which
might be likely to
poison
the
happiness
of one
she
at
once envied and hated.
One act of guilt leads but to the
commission
of
another
;
it is in vain the human heart may think only
this one little deviation, and I will
stop
. As the ball
precipitated from the
summit
of a hill
pauses
not, but
rushes
with amazing velocity till it reaches the very
lowest
part of the vale beneath,
so
the human
soul
,
giving way to temptation,
sinks
from error into guilt,
nor
pauses
till plunged in the
lowest
abyss
of depravity.
Another and another letter from Hamden was
opened
by Mrs. Varnice,
whilst
those
from Rachel (
whose
heart now began to throb with fear, doubt, and a
thousand
anxieties, which none but
those
who are
united to, and
suffering
an early
separation
from, the
man of their choice can conceive)
suffered
the
same
fate. At length one arrived
inclosing
a bank bill for
a hundred pounds. At the
sight
of it, Mrs. Varnice
turned pale; fear was the
first
emotion of her
bosom
.
But not even Lettuce was privy to the receipt of this
letter. Mrs. Varnice was not very economical; a
hundred pounds would relieve her from
some
few
embarrassments
.
She looked at it,
paused
for a moment,
at length, committing the letter to the fire,
she
deposited
the note in her pocket-book, and on the
ensuing
morning exchanged it at a
silk
mercer's where
she
purchased
a gown of
rose
-coloured tabby.
This note would have been very acceptable to
Rachel
;
for
she
began to be
sensible
of the
decrease
of
her finances, and to experience the
solicitude
and
pleasing
cares of maternal
tenderness
; and to prepare for
the reception of a little
stranger
,
she
had nearly
exhausted
the whole of the money Hamden had given
her at parting.
It cannot be
supposed
that the mind of Hamden
was in a much
easier
state
than that of our heroine;
but as he was now on a party of
pleasure
with his
uncle
,
lady Anne and lady Lucy, making
excursions
from one part of Scotland to another, and
staying
but
a few days in each place, he reconciled
himself
to not
hearing from his wife, under the idea that her letters
might not follow him as he directed, and that he
should
get them all together when he returned to
Glasgow
.
But when he returned, and found not a
single
letter
waiting for him, he felt the
utmost
impatience, and
would have
set
off immediately for London, but that
his aunt was attacked with an alarming fever, and to
leave her at
such
a period, would be the height of
ingratitude
.
She lingered long, and even when
pronounced
out of danger,
still
hovered as it were on the
brink of the grave for many weeks, and at length
change of climate was ordered as the only chance of
perfect
restoration
.
Hamden,
whose
mind was now tortured
almost
beyond
sufferance
, finding that he
should
be obliged to
attend his aunt to
Lisbon
,
whilst
preparations were
making for the voyage,
dispatched
his confidential
servant
to London, to make inquiries for and bear
remittances
to our heroine. Though this man may
justly
be termed confidential, yet
so
fearful had Hamden
been of having his marriage known, that even he was
not
entrusted
with the
secret
, and Rachel was
humiliated
even in the eyes of her
husband
's
servant
. But
her manners were
such
as had ever
secured
respect
from
James, and the
honest
fellow, often when he thought
of her
situation
, pitied her, and blamed his
master
.
Nearly
seven
months had now
elapsed
since
the
marriage
of our heroine, above five of which
she
had been
separated
from her
husband
, and half of that period
had
passed
in the continual
distress
of alternate
expectation
and
disappointment
.
I have been deceived,
she
would
say
,
whilst
tears
of
anguish
stole
down her cheeks; Hamden no
longer
loves, no longer thinks of me, and,
forsaken
of him,
who is there in this
vast
universe
, (for Heaven alone
can tell whether my dear brother is in
existence
) who
then is there that cares for the unhappy Rachel? And
forlorn,
forsaken
, wretched as I am, I
shall
give life to
a
helpless
innocent,
whose
father will perhaps
blush
to
own him.
Rachel's days were
joyless
, and the tear of
anguish
fell nightly on her pillow. The
rose
no longer
bloomed
on her cheeks, nor did the animated beam of health
and internal peace dance in her
expressive
eyes; pale,
languid, heart-broken,
she
suffered
in
silence
; for to
whom could
she
complain?
Mrs. Varnice had
exposed
to her, her true
character
,
and Rachel would not hold communication with
a woman
she
despised
. She
nursed
her grief in
solitude
.
If
she
endeavoured to
amuse
the heavy hour,
by her pencil or
music
, every flower
she
drew was
moistened
by her tears, and the chords of the
instrument
reverberated but the
strains
of melancholy.
It was a fine morning in the beginning of March,
that,
still
considering
it a duty to
use
every method to
preserve
health, (though life was no longer valuable)
Rachel walked to the green park. It was an early
hour;
she
did not fear being met by any one who
knew her; there were but few by whom
she
would
be recognized, and
those
few
seldom
visited
the park
except on a Sunday evening, to
see
and be
seen
. As
with
slow
step
she
paced along the margin of
Rosamond's
Pond,
she
was
startled
by a voice which
suddenly
exclaimed, Heavens and earth!
Miss
Dudley
!
She
raised
her eyes, and beheld Archibald
Oliver. A
sudden
emotion,
something
like
shame
,
rushed
upon her heart;
she
just
articulated his name,
extended her hand towards him, and, tottering to a
seat
that was near,
she
sunk
on it
almost
fainting.
Good God! my dear
Miss
Dudley, to what am I
to attribute
these
emotions?
My name is Dacres, Sir,
said
Rachel; but her
voice faltered, and the carnation
visited
her cheeks as
she
remembered her very apparent
situation
.
You are married then?
Yes.
May you be happy, happy as you
deserve
. But
why thus alone? it is not
surely
proper. Where is
Mr. Dacres?
The
sormer
intimacy that had
subsisted
between
Oliver
and our heroine could alone have
excused
these
abrupt interrogations; but Rachel had ever
considered
him as a brother, and new ties, new affections, had
made him behold her now only in the endearing light
of a
sister
.
My
husband
is in Scotland,
said
Rachel,
whither
he was called by
business
of
consequence
; but
come (continued
she
, forcing a
smile
) if you are
disengaged
,
walk home with me, and I will tell you all you
wish
to know, and in return be very
inquisitive
concerning
your
happiness
.
Then, with that innocent freedom that gave a charm
to all her actions,
she
passed
her hand through his arm,
and they
pursued
their way to her lodgings, engaged
in
such
interesting
chat, that they had reached the door
before either imagined they were half way.
During their walk, Rachel told as much of her own
story
as could be done without infringing the vow
she
had voluntarily made to Auberry never to divulge his
real name and family till authorized by him; and in
return,
she
learnt that Oliver had experienced a very
tolerable
share
of
happiness
in his matrimonial
connexions
,
that his
wise
was then in town, and had
just
made him a father. Of
Jessy
he could give her no
information, and
since
our heroine's marriage, that
young lady had declined the
correspondence
of Rachel,
alleging, as
she
no longer
shared
her
considence
,
she
would not intrude her letters where
she
must
suppose
them unwelcome. This had at the time given Rachel
much pain; but as Hamden would not allow her to
explain her
situation
to her friend,
she
was forced to
relinquish
a
correspondence
so
dear to her heart, and
with it all
intercourse
with the only woman
she
had
ever known whom
she
thought really
deserved
the name
of friend.
Oliver could not on that morning
set
above half an
hour with our heroine; but on the
ensuing
day he
called
,
and drank tea with her. After this,
scarce
a day
passed
but he inquired after her health. He
saw
there
was
something
of
mystery
enveloped her; he
saw
she
D d
was not happy; and though his knowledge of her
heart,
understanding
and principles made him reject
the idea whenever it intruded
itself
, he
sometimes
almost
seared
she
had been imprudent.
To the afflicted heart, the voice of
friendship
is a
soothing
cordial. Rachel had not heard its
adulating
sound
for
several
months previous to her meeting
with Oliver. She dreamt not of impropriety, and,
unconscious
of evil, dreaded not
censure
. His
visits
were always welcome, and the day
passed
drearily in
which
she
saw
him not.
It has been already remarked, that the
greatest
and
almost
only
sault
of our heroine was a too great
openness
of
disposition
, in regard to her own
circumstances
or
business
;
she
never thought of concealment, and
nothing but the
most
unbounded affection for Auberry
could have prompted her to enter into engagements
which would involve her conduct in apparent
mystery
,
and oblige her to wear for a while the veil of
concealment
.
To Oliver, therefore, only concealing his real
name and family,
she
was explicit in regard to her
fears for the health and life of her
husband
;
she
also
,
without
hesitation
, mentioned the
embarrassed
state
of
her
sinances
. Oliver offered her money; but, though
she
sought
consolation
from the
soothings
of
friendship
,
her
spirit
rose
above pecuniary obligation. She
was grateful for the offer, but firm in her
refusal
to
avail
herself
of it.
On the evening when this explanation took place,
Oliver had
supped
with Rachel, and the
hoarse
voice
of the watchmen proclaiming half
past
eleven o'clock,
was the
first
thing that reminded them it was time to
break off their
interesting
conversation
. They had
talked of Reuben, of
Jessy
, and the doubtful
sate
of
those
dear relatives had drawn tears from both their
eyes.
I
must
leave you, Mrs. Dacres,
said
he,
rising
and taking his hat.
Rachel rang the bell; but no one
answering
,
she
took one of the candles from the table, and
descended
the
stairs
to light him out.
Good night, my dear Madam,
said
he; do not
come to the door, you will take cold.
Good night, Mr. Oliver,
said
Rachel; and as
he pulled the door after him,
she
turned the key, put
the chain
across
, and turned to re-
ascend
the
stairs
,
when, to her
surprise
, the parlour door opened, and
Mrs. Varnice appeared.
Bless
me,
said
Rachel, I thought you were all
in bed.
Oh! I dare
say
you did, and hoped it too.
Hoped, Madam! I neither hoped, nor cared;
only
I rang the bell for Lettuce to light Mr. Oliver out,
and as
she
did not
answer
it
I would not let her
answer
it; and let me tell
you, Mrs. Dacres, (if that is your name) I think your
conduct very unwarrantable; and if you
must
have
gentlemen
visiting
you in your
husband
's
absence
, and
staying
till twelve or one o'clock, you
must
get
another
lodging; for I will have no
such
goings on in
my
house
. Mr. Dacres, (as you call him) if he is
your
husband
, will have no great
reason
to be
pleased
with your conduct; and if he is not, why, my
house
is a
house
of good repute, and the
sooner
you quit it
the better.
Petrified with
astonishment
, Rachel could not
answer
for the
space
of a minute; at length,
resentment
conquering her
sensibility
,
she
replied:
Had I
supposed
you entertained
such
humiliating
ideas of me, Madam, I would not
so
long have
remained
an inmate in your habitation; but, painful as
it is to me, I
shall
be
necessitated
to
stay
some
little
time longer till I can
discharge
my account with you.
I
shall
not leave a
house
whilst
I am indebted to the
mistress
of it.
No, I'll take care of that,
said
Mrs. Varnice, with
a malicious grin; I
shall
hardly let you go in my
debt when I can detain any valuable property to the
amount. But I
shall
say
no more to-night,
to-morrow
you
must
look out for another place, and pay me
how you can; for paid I will be, or you
must
take
the
consequence
, and
so
good-night.
Rachel would have
said
good-night, but the words
stuck
in her throat;
she
slightly
inclined her head, and
passing
hastily
up
stairs
,
sunk
almost
sainting
on the
nearest
seat
. Lettuce, who had been tutored by Mrs.
Varnice, followed her up, pretended to blame her
cousin
, and take the part of our heroine.
I will not
stay
in the
house
,
said
Rachel, but
how to
raise
money to pay her.
Dear! that would be no difficult matter,
said
Lettuce,
so
many pretty trinkets as you have!
Those
bracelets now
Rachel looked on them and
sighed
.
I cannot part with them,
said
she
, they were
the
first
present
I received from my
husband
.
Well, but you have
such
a
vast
number of pretty
things, your watch and your etwee!
This
conversation
let our heroine into a
secret
with
which
she
was before entirely unacquaintedthat
she
could
raise
a
sum
of money on
these
baubles without
entirely parting with them; and
she
went to bed with
a full determination to quit the
mansion
where
she
had been
so
much
insulted
, the
ensuing
morning. It
may well be
supposed
she
slept
but little;
short
moments
of
forgetfulness
, and
those
interrupted by
horrid
visions
, were all
she
could obtain.
At the dawn
she
arose
, and
so
earnestly
did
she
set
about a removal, that by twelve o'clock,
she
had paid
the exorbitant demands of Mrs. Varnice, and was
seated
in her new lodgings; though to
accomplish
this point
she
had
disposed
of
almost
every thing of
value
she
possessed
, not excepting the bracelets, for which
she
had
expressed
so
much regard.
Two days after this removal, James arrived,
commissioned
by his
master
to make inquiry after our
heroine
.
The tale told by the arch-
siend
, Mrs. Varnice,
filled his
honest
heart with horror.
Receive the
visits
of gentlemen, obliged to leave
the lodgings in which his
master
had placed her, and
go into others, on account of keeping bad hours, and
other
disorderly
behaviour. Good Sirs,
said
James,
I can hardly believe it;
she
was
so
good,
so
modest
,
so
mild. It made one's heart glad to look at her; and
to hear her talk, would a made an old man young again.
Body o' me! there
must
a been
some
witchcraft
used
to make her change
so
all of a
sudden
.
But to all James's inquiries of where
she
was
removed
to, they pleaded ignorance; and he being
restricted
in the time allowed him to make the journey, could
not
stay
so
long as he
wished
to make inquiries in the
neighbourhood. With a heavy heart, he
set
forward
on his return to his
master
; but near Berwick, the
carriage was
overset
in which he was travelling, and
his right arm broken.
Hamden, agonized
almost
to
distraction
by his long
absence
, the
cause
of which he was not acquainted
with, (as a
sever
and delirium, which immediately
succeeded
the accident, provented James from taking
any method to let his
master
know his
situation
) was
obliged to embark with his aunt, without receiving
the
least
intelligence of the
sate
of Rachel.
`She has forgotten me,
she
repeants her union with
me,' he would
say
, `and
seeks
for an opportunity to
break
those
engagements which I have
hesitated
to
announce to the world.'
In
these
moments he would be ready to reveal all
to his aunt; but the fear that Rachel no longer loved
him, or perhaps was no longer worthy of his affection
for her, always withheld him; and the voyage to
Lisbon
,
though in
itself
extremely
pleasant
,
seemed
to
the unhappy Hamden to teem only with vexation, and
when landed, and the
first
bustle
of
seeking
a lodging,
&c. was over, he walked through the
streets
like a
discontented
shade
; indeed, it was but the
shadow
of
Hamden Auberry, for his better part was flown to the
shores
of Albion, where it hovered round the
mansion
in which he imagined
still
dwelt the object of his
dearest
affection.

CHAP. XV.
Sorrows of the Heart.
In
the mean time, the afflictions of our heroine
daily
increased
. Oliver had left London;
she
was
without friends and without money, and to
increase
the
sorrows
of her heart,
she
became the mother of a
fine boy about the middle of June. Before her
confinement
,
she
entrusted
her
hostess
with the real
state
of her
sinances
, and to retrench her
expenses
, had
taken
a room on the
second
story
, where
she
suffered
in
silence
all the
miseries
of
disappointed
love, added to
the poignant
sting
of poverty. Once
she
wrote to
Mrs. Auberry; had
she
addressed
the letter to Dr.
Lenient,
she
had done right. But Mrs. Auberry had
received a letter from Mrs.
Webster
, which had
prejudiced
her
against
Rachel;
she
therefore did not
mention
to her brother that
she
had heard from her, and
threw the letter into a draw, without deigning to give
our
distressed
heroine the comfort of one line in
answer
.
During her
consinement
,
she
was told by the
woman
who attended her, that a very fine lady had
taken the range of apartments on the
first
floor, which
consisted
of a dining-room, drawing-room, and
bedchamber
;
that
she
had taken them only for a few
weeks,
whilst
her own
house
was
finished
and properly
furnished
. She is a charming lady,
said
the
talkative
old woman, and keeps her chariot, her own
maid and footman.
All this intelligence appeared of
so
little
consequence
to our heroine, that
she
scarcely
heard a
syllable
of the whole harangue; but the next day, as
she
was
passing
from the bed to the
sofa
at the other end
of the room,
she
cast
her eyes
casually
out of the
window
;
an elegant chariot drew up to the door, and to
her utter
astonishment
she
saw
Mrs. Courtney
descend
from it.
Lost
in amazement,
she
sat
down; that her eyes
had not deceived her,
she
was certain. To what could
she
attribute this
sudden
elevation of fortune? This
was a riddle
she
had not power to unravel; but
whatever
was the
cause
,
she
rejoiced at the effect, and,
forgetting
the
coldness
she
had experienced from La
Varone
immediately after her marriage with Lieutenant
Courtney,
conscious
only of a
pleasurable
sensation
,
to find a
person
with whom
she
had formerly lived in
habits of intimacy
so
near her,
she
wrote with a
pencil
on a
slip
of paper,
Dear Mrs. Courtney, your friend Rachel is again
an inmate of the
mansion
you inhabit, and flatters
herself
you will give her the
pleasure
of your company
for half an hour.
This billet
she
sent
by the
nurse
, and in a few
moments
Mrs. Courtney entered the apartment. The
attendant withdrawn, and a few common-place
inquiries
past
,
You cannot think, my dear Madam,
said
our
heroine, what real
pleasure
it gives me to find Mr.
Courtney's
prospects
so
much amended,
since
your
marriage.
Yes, he is made a Captain;
besides
, a particular
friend of mine, whom I had not
seen
for many years,
has
settled
on me a very
handsome
income, which
makes me quite independent.
How fortunate!
said
Rachel in the
simplicity
of
her heart. And where is Captain Courtney?
Gone to India.
Is either of your
sisters
, or your mother-in-law in
town with you?
Oh dear no.
They are well, I hope?
Yes, quite well; that is, I believe
so
, for I have
heard nothing to the contrary, but I have not
seen
them lately.
No?
No, not for
these
three months
past
. But come,
tell me, my demure friend, what changes have taken
place in your
sate
since
we parted.
With a look of mingled
confusion
and candour, in
the
simple
language of truth did Rachel explain to
Mrs. Courtney every
circumstance
of her marriage
and
consequent
uneasiness
,
still
concealing the real
name of her
husband
.
She
spoke
to a woman
whose
heart was impure,
and who
scrupled
not to judge of others by
herself
.
Besides
, Mrs. Courtney had been to
visit
Mrs.
Webster
,
and had learnt from her the manner of our
heroine's
departure from her
house
, and with whom it was
supposed
she
resided
. She laughed at the affliction
Rachel appeared to experience from her
husband
's
neglect, called her agony of heart ideal
misery
, told
her the honey moon could not
last
forever, bid her
keep up her
spirits
, and, promifing to
see
her again in
the evening, left her. Accordingly, in the evening
she
again
visited
her.
I have been thinking, Mrs. Dacres,
said
she
with
a half
smile
, and looking
sidelong
from under her dark
eyelashes
, that change of
scene
and air would be of
service
to you. I am going into Northumberland, to
visit
our old acquaintance, Mrs. Spriggins; what
say
you to a jaunt? You will travel at your
ease
with me
in the chariot, Pelham will help take care of the child,
and I dare
say
the journey will not be the
less
agreeable
because
it will take you near the borders of
Scotland
.
A tinge of carnation
passed
over the languid cheek
of Rachel, as
she
said
she
should
like
such
an
excursion
,
but it was not in her power to take it.
What, for want of money, I
suppose
?
Pshaw
!
nonsense
! you cannot be wholly
destitute
; a
trisle
will
serve
, and you
surely
wish
to be nearer the Major than
you are at
present
.
Rachel's heart beat quick, as
she
attempted to
reply
.
Mrs. Courtney put her hand before her mouth,
Come, don't deny it; I have found out your
secret
,
but I won't betray you. Perhaps, when you are
within a day's journey, he may be able to
visit
you.
London is at a
vast
distance
from the banks of the
Clyde.
There is nothing more difficult to a
person
of
natural
veracity than to be under the
necessity
of
afferting
a
salsehood
. Rachel
selt
the
impossibility
of
doing
it, and remained
silent
. In
short
, her innocence,
her credulity, her ardent
wish
to be near her
husband
prevailed, and
she
consented
to accompany Mrs.
Courtney
into Northumberland. But, however liable to err
from the
frankness
and candour of her temper, Rachel
had
still
that pride of
soul
which could not
condescend
to tell Mrs. Courtney that three guineas, and a few
clothes,
constituted
the whole of her worldly
possessions
.
Part of
those
clothes, with
some
very
sine
laces, were
disposed
of to pay the
nurse
and other contingent
expenses
;
and with a mere trifle in her
purse
, our
heroine
departed with her unworthy affociate from London.
Mrs. Courtney was deceived when
she
invited
Rachel
to take, this journey with her; but it was the
depravity
of her own heart had deceived her, and before
the reached Northumberland,
she
discovered
that the
mind of our heroine was
still
uncontaminated,
still
pure, and
shrunk
from vice with
disgust
, turned from
immorality with abhorrence.
On their arrival at Mr. Spriggins's, Mrs. Courtney
was received with a
profusion
of compliments,
whilst
Rachel was
scarcely
noticed. She was
shown
to an
upper apartment, and, weary as
she
was with the
journey
,
suffered
to
undress
the child
herself
, and put him
to bed. She laid him on the pillow of
repose
, and,
kneeling
beside
the bed, poured forth her afflicted
soul
to her Maker. Her cheek
rested
on the
same
pillow
with that of her infant, and her tears flowed without
restraint
. She
selt
that the pretended
friendship
of
Mrs. Courtney was only
ostentation
;
she
feared
she
had more to
susser
than
she
should
be able to
support
.
She prayed for
resignation
to the will of Heaven, and
her tears continued to
slow
, not from impatience, they
were the
effusions
of an afflicted
spirit
.
After a few weeks
residence
in the family of Mrs.
Spriggins, Rachel perceived that not even a
shadow
of
respect
and attention towards
herself
remained in the
manners of the whole family. At meals,
she
was
suffered
to take the
lowest
seat
at the table, where
she
was
sometimes
so
totally overlooked, as not to be helped
till every one
else
had begun their dinner; and then
she
was
insulted
by an affectation of friendly
familiarity
,
such
as,
Bless
me, Mrs. Dacres, I had forgot
you; but why don't you
speak
? you are at home you
know.
At
these
moments, Rachel's heart would
swell
to
her eyes, and in
struggling
to
suppress
her tears, the
food
she
attempted to
swallow
seemed
almost
to choak
her.
Mrs. Courtney
disagreed
with and
discharged
her
woman, and the next day
requested
our heroine to
rise
from her
seat
, and fetch her work from the other end
of the room. Had Rachel been independent,
she
would without
hesitation
have complied with the
request
;
but Rachel was poor, and
she
felt the
request
an
insult
.
I am not qualified to
supply
the place of your
servant
, Madam,
said
she
haughtily.
Why I do not
suppose
you are,
said
Mrs.
Courtney
,
yawning indolently; but indeed, child,
circumstanced
as you are, I do not know what you could do
better than endeavour to get a place; though to
be
sure
your child is an objection.
The
expressive
eyes of our heroine
flashed
indignation
,
at the
insolent
manner and
proposal
of her
oftentatious
friend; but
she
disdained
to
answer
. `I am
not yet fallen quite
so
low as that,' thought
she
, and
rose
to quit the apartment.
I really am
sorry
for you, child, continued Mrs.
Courtney, detaining her, but painful as it is for a
person
who is
so
much
interested
for your welfare as I
am to
speak
disagreeable
truths, I really
must
tell you,
that the haughty airs you give
yourself
are very
unbecoming
;
you
must
learn humility.
I hope I
shall
in time,
said
Rachel indignantly,
if I do not, I
shall
profit but little by your
endeavours
.
Come, come, you
misunderstand
me; if you do
not incline to do
something
for a livelihood, I really
think it would be
adviseable
for you to go on to
Scotland
to your
husband
. I expect a friend of mine here
in a few days, with whom I am going to make a tour
through the northern counties; if you
choose
to go
with me in quality of a companion, and take the care
of my clothes,
assist
me to
dress
and
undress
, I will
pay you twenty guineas a year; but then you
must
leave your child here at
nurse
.
No, Mrs. Courtney,
said
Rachel, if I am obliged
to eat the the bread of
servitude
, I will earn it of
strangers
,
not of one who once thought
herself
honoured
in being called the friend of Rachel Dudley. I will
be the humble companion (or rather a
slave
on which
ill humour may be
lavished
with impunity) to no one.
I would gladly embrace your
first
proposal
of
seeking
my
husband
, but you know I have not the means of
prosecuting
the journey, even by the
cheapest
conveyance
.
Heavens and earth! replied Mrs. Courtney,
with a look of well-affected
surprise
, is it
possible
you
can have come into this
strange
place without any
money? And what do you mean to do, child?
To be no longer
troublesome
to you, Madam,
said
Rachel. I thank you, Madam, continued
she
,
for the
shelter
your roof has
so
long afforded me,
turning to Mrs. Spriggins, who had
sat
a
silent
and
insensible
spectatress
of the
scene
, but will no longer
intrude; but this very night remove to a habitation
better
suited
to my
present
humble condition.
She then
hastily
left the room. On the
stairs
she
met Belle
Webster
.
What is the matter, Mrs. Dacres?
said
she
; for
the tears, which a laudable pride had
restrained
whilst
she
was in the
presence
of her
insolent
hostess
and her
companion, wounded
sensibility
forced in a torrent
from her eyes the moment
she
had
shut
the door.
What is the matter?
said
Belle.
Nothing, replied our heroine, only I have
stayed
here too long.
Dear! I'm afraid
sister
has been vexing you;
well, don't mind her, you know
she
never was very
good natured.
I do not mind either her or her
associate
,
said
Rachel; but I
wish
to
release
them from an
unwelcome
intruder, and
shall
leave the
house
immediately.
Do me the favour,
Miss
Webster
, to
request
one of the
servants
may take my trunk to the inn.
Dearee me! I hope you are not in
earnest
?
In very
earnest
, I
assure
you.
Well, now I'm quite
sorry
.
I thank you,
Miss
Webster
. Will you
ask
the
favour I
request
?
Oh! to be
sure
I will; but you won't go before
tea?
Before another hour,
said
Rachel firmly.
Belle was not overburthened with
understanding
;
she
did not perfectly comprehend the delicacy of our
heroine's feelings, nor did
she
give
herself
the trouble
to think much about it;
so
wishing
her health,
she
descended
the
stairs
, and
sent
up a boy to take her trunk.
It was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon,
when Rachel, taking her dear boy in her arms, and
followed by the lad with her parcels, left the
house
of
Mr. Spriggins, and went to
seek
a lodging in a town,
to
almost
every inhabitant of which
she
was a perfect
stranger
. She knew that the public inns afforded
lodgings to travellers, and to one of the
most
reputable
of
these
she
directed her
steps
. Her
purse
was but
slenderly
provided, but
she
augmented her little
store
by
the
sale
of a gold locket, the
last
thing of value which
she
possessed
, and from which
she
took a lock of plaited
hair; for it was the hair of Hamden Auberry, and to
her a
thousand
times more precious than the metal
in which it had been
enshrined
.
On the following morning,
she
inquired after a
private
lodging, and was recommended by the woman
who kept the inn, to a mean apartment in one of the
most
unfrequented
streets
in the town. To this
humble
asylum
she
retired, and felt a degree of
melancholy
pleasure
that
she
could indulge her tears
without
restraint
.
It may
occasion
some
degree of
surprise
, that
Spriggins
,
who had formerly been an admirer of our
heroine
,
would
suffer
her to leave his
house
without either
friends or money; but the heart by nature contracted,
and
whose
chief object has been
self
, is
sensibly
affected
by an appearance of
slight
; it can never either
forget
or forgive it; and
such
a heart languidly moved
in the
bosom
of Spriggins.
But
those
visitors
, who had
seen
Rachel in the
family
,
and now
missed
her, felt an awakened
curiosity
to
know what was become of her. To
these
interrogatories
had the
Mesdames
Spriggins and Courtney
simply
answered
, that
she
was gone home;
curiosity
would
have died, but they felt they had done wrong in
driving
her, poor and unprotected as
she
was, from their
house
; and in palliation of
so
inhuman an action,
threw
aspersions
on her character. Not content with
depriving her of the protection of their own roof, they
prevented her obtaining that protection from any
other
,
whose
inmates were in the
smallest
degree
respectable
.
That the human heart is liable to error, and that
on the eternal record our crimes and follies are
enrolled
,
and will one day appear in dreadful judgment
against
us, is a
solemn
truth, which no
person
of
common
sense
will attempt to deny; yet we are led to
hope, that the tear of
unseigned
penitence will blot
those
offences out. But the crime of
slander
is of
so
soul
a die, its
sable
hue
stains
the
sacred
page, and
only
mercy infinite can purify it. Oh thou Giver of life,
guard, I
beseech
thee, my heart from ingratitude,
and my lips from
slander
; and for the
rest
, thy will
be done.
During the period of
these
vicissitudes
, Rachel had
never omitted writing every week to her
husband
,
only
at the time when the birth of her
son
prevented her.
These
letters, written after
she
left the
house
of Mrs.
Varnice, all lay at the place where he had
desired
them to be
addressed
; and when James was
sufficiently
recovered to follow his
master
, he made them into
a parcel, and took them with him.
But words are inadequate to
describe
the feelings
of Hamden, when he by turns
listened
to the account
E e
which James gave him, and read the pathetic letters
of his wife;
sometimes
love,
sometimes
resentment
predominated. But when he read that he was a
father
,
and that his once loved Rachel, in that
season
of
sickness
, was without the means to
purchase
the
necessary
accommodations and comforts to render the
situation
in
some
measure
supportable
, he determined to
hazard every thing, own his marriage, and fly to her
relief and comfort.
Hamden was ever impetuous; he
resolved
one
moment
,
and the next put the
resolve
in execution.
Lady
Anne heard him with more
calmness
than he had
expected; but that apparent calm was deceitful;
when he had
finished
,
she
upbraided him with his
duplicity
,
imprecated
misery
on both
himself
and his wife,
and with a determined air renounced him forever.
In vain was every endeavour to
soften
her
resentment
,
and Hamden embarked for England, without the
smallest
hope of being
reinstated
in her affection, or of
ever being the better for her fortune.
Mortified pride, love and
jealousy
corroded in his
bosom
during his
short
voyage; and on his arrival in
London, he repaired immediately to the
house
of Mrs.
Varnice; for though Rachel had mentioned her
removal
,
yet
she
had forgot to mention the name of the
street
to which
she
had removed; and though
she
was
displeased
with Mrs. Varnice, yet, as
she
did not know
the extent of that woman's
vileness
,
she
spoke
of her
no farther than to
say
she
had
reason
to think both
Hamden and
herself
had been
mistaken
in her
character
.
This was not
sufficient
to deter Hamden from
going to her
house
,
especially
as he conceived it the
only probable means of finding Rachel. But this
visit
did not
serve
to conciliate his affection, or awaken
returning
tenderness
. Mrs. Varnice told her own tale.
Our poor heroine was
represented
as imprudent, if not
guilty, in regard to Oliver; extravagant and
thoughtless
,
in her
expenses
.
Why indeed,
said
Auberry, I thought I left
her
sufficient
to defray every
expense
till my return;
and when I found my
stay
protracted beyond my
expectations
,
I forwarded her a hundred pounds.
Well, who could have thought it?
said
Mrs.
Varnice; before
she
left me,
she
, to my certain
knowledge,
raised
money on her watch, rings,
bracelets
.
Bracelets?
said
Hamden.
Oh yes! Lettuce pledged them for her.
Cruel, unkind Rachel!
Dear! don't let it
distress
you
so
; I
suppose
her
young friend Oliver helped her off with
some
of the
money.
Damn him!
said
Hamden. Oh! Rachel,
Rachel, why have you
used
me thus? Oh! Mrs.
Varnice, if you knew how I loved her, how I adored
her! how at this moment her
fascinating
image twines
around every chord, every fibre of my heart! you
would wonder how
she
could be
so
ungrateful,
so
vile,
so
barbarous.
Alas! weak, credulous Auberry, had you
instead
of
listening
to this woman's infamous
aspersions
,
treated
them with
scorn
, and boldly
asserted
the innocence
of your wife, and your full confidence in her truth and
honour, her
accuser
,
conscious
of her own guilt and
duplicity, would have retired intimidated within
herself
, and
shrunk
from a
scrutiny
, from whence
she
must
have been
assured
her own
falsehood
would
stand
detected. But who will
espouse
the
cause
of an
injured
wife, when he who has
solemnly
sworn
to
protect
her from all evil,
listens
with avidity to the voice
that defames her, and joins with her
worst
enemies to
precipitate her into the
abyss
of ignominy.
From the
house
of Mrs. Varnice, Hamden went to
the lodging
she
had
last
occupied, and there, from a
conversation
with the woman of the
house
, learnt the
route Rachel had taken, and with whom; but
unfortunately
,
he
also
learnt that
she
had been
visited
almost
daily by Oliver, during the period of his
stay
in London. Tortured
almost
to
madness
, he
resolved
to follow her, upbraid her with her perfidy and cruelty,
oblige her to
relinquish
the care of the child to him,
and take an
everlasting
leave of her.
In the mean time, our heroine was drinking very
deeply of the cup of affliction; poverty was her
constant
companion. The trifle
she
possessed
, at the time
she
left the
house
of Spriggins, was
soon
expended,
and by degrees the remains of her wardrobe dwindled
away, till two cotton gowns, with a change of linen,
were the whole of her earthly
possessions
. She had
inquired for work, but could get none. The dearth
of
amusement
in a country town makes every trifle,
if wearing the appearance of novelty, become of
consequence
;
and what
spreads
faster
than a tale of
scandal
?
The
circumstance
of our heroine's coming from
London to Mr. Spriggins, and quitting the
house
so
abruptly, had been talked over in
almost
every family
in the place, told a hundred different ways, and each
narrator adding or altering
some
circumstance
, poor
Rachel was looked upon, even by the woman of whom
she
rented her
small
apartment, as a
suspicious
character
;
and had
she
been inclined to partake the
pleasures
of
society
,
she
would have found the doors of
almost
every
class
of people
shut
against
her. But
she
had
still
the
consolation
of an innocent heart, and a
firm faith and reliance on an
omniscient
Deity, who
would not
suffer
her eventually to
perish
. She
submitted
to her afflictions as to the wife
dispensations
of
his providence, and prayed daily for a more humble,
more unrepining
spirit
. She was entirely ignorant
also
, that any
stigma
had been thrown on her
reputation
,
and
conscious
of not
deserving
,
she
feared not
the
censures
of a world, which, though
she
would not
wilfully offend,
she
was but little
solicitous
to
please
.
The neglect of Auberry
sunk
the
deepest
into her
heart, when her thoughts reverted to the few happy
weeks
past
in his
society
immediately after their
marriage
.
The tear of bitter remembrance would
gush
from her eyes, and as
she
pressed
her infant to her
heart, it bled at every vein, that he, as well as
herself
,
should
be
so
totally abandoned by his father.
It was one evening in
August
, when Rachel,
having
lulled her darling to
sleep
, the twilight
still
giving
sufficient
light, took her tablets from her pocket, and,
as
she
leaned over a window
she
had
just
opened to
gaze at the
serenity
of an evening, that
seemed
to give
pleasure
to the whole creation but her forlorn,
unhappy
self
, wrote with her pencil the following lines:
When the frame to the earth is bent low,
By
sickness
or
sorrow
opprest
;
When the moments drag
pensive
and flow,
And the heart it lies cold in the
breast
;
When each
social
comfort is fled,
Nor friend nor companion is near;
When
rest
has
forsaken
the bed,
And the pillow is
stain
'd with a tear:
Ah! then, what avails each gay
scene
Which Nature unfolds to our
sight
?
In vain Phebus
rises
serene
,
Or Cynthia enlivens the night!
In vain is you canopy
spread
Thus gorgeous, with
sapphire
and gold,
When each
sense
of
pleasure
is fled,
And each fond affection lies cold!
Haste
, Apathy,
haste
thee, and bring,
With poppies
infused
in the bowl,
A draught from the Lethean
spring
To
steep
in oblivion my
soul
.
Thy fable
stole
pass
'fore mine eyes,
That when pale affliction I view,
No
shades
of
past
pleasures
may
rise
To
sharpen
her arrows anew.
But come, with thy
sense
-numbing power,
Assist
me
those
arrows to brave;
Nor leave me till that happy hour,
When I
sink
to
repose
in the grave!
When
she
had
finished
, the full
sense
of her own
deplorable
situation
rushed
upon her mind;
she
rested
her head upon her hand, and, unable to weep, a kind
of
stupor
pervaded all her
senses
; and
so
entirely
absorbed
E e 2
was
she
in her own agonizing reflections, that
she
was as perfectly
lost
to every
surrounding
object
as if
she
had been no longer in
existence
. From this
reverie
she
was
aroused
by the cry of her child, and in
her
haste
to let down the window,
she
dropped her
tablets. It was an awkward
circumstance
; for the
window looked into a garden belonging to a genteel
house
that was in another
street
. It was therefore
impossible
to regain them that night; but
she
resolved
to go early the
ensuing
morning to inquire for them;
for they had formerly belonged to her mother, and
were on that account highly valued by Rachel.
Accordingly, the next morning, as
soon
as
she
imagined
she
could gain admittance,
she
took her child
in her arms, and walked round to the front of the
house
. The door was opened by a decent young
woman, and Rachel was beginning to
speak
, when,
turning her eyes toward a parlour, the door of which
stood
partly open,
she
saw
Archibald Oliver,
dressed
in deep mourning,
sitting
at a
breakfast
table, and
holding the identical tablets
she
came to inquire for,
in his hand. She was
surprised
she
was
silent
.
Did you
wish
to
see
my
mistress
, Ma'am?
said
the young woman.
Yes!
said
Rachel, hardly
conscious
that
she
had
answered
at all.
There was
something
in the air and manner of our
heroine, that, had
she
been clothed in the
meanest
apparel
,
would
still
have commanded
respect
. The young
woman
passed
before her, and
courtesying
as
she
pushed
open the parlour door,
desired
her to walk in, and
she
would call her
mistress
immediately. At the
sound
of approaching
steps
, Oliver
raised
his eyes.
Good God! Mrs. Dacres! exclaimed he.
Rachel was fluttered;
she
could not
speak
. A
languid
smile
illumined her pallid countenance as
she
extended
her hand towards him. But the
expressive
tear that
burst
from its
glistening
orbit, contradicted
the appearance of tranquillity the
smile
was meant to
convey.
How is it, Mr. Oliver,
said
she
, when
she
could
command her voice, that I
see
you here?
A very unhappy
circumstance
brought me and
still
detains me here, he replied. Rachel glanced
her eye over his fable
dress
.
Jessy
darted into her
mind.
Your
sister
!
said
she
eagerly.
Is well, interrupted he, at once comprehending
her fears, at
least
I have no
reason
to think to the
contrary; but Mrs. Oliver is no more.
His voice faltered; Rachel was
silent
;
she
knew
the folly and impertinence of common-place
consolation
.
Oliver recovered
himself
, and having learnt
from our heroine every occurrence that had taken
place
since
he
saw
her in London, he in return
informed
her, that
friendship
for a very particular
acquaintance
of her's had brought him to that place
An acquaintance of mine?
said
Rachel.
Yes, Lieutenant Courtney.
Courtney! You
astonish
me; I thought he was
gone to India.
He had an appointment of that kind, which was
procured him by lord M; but
some
discoveries
which he made after he had even joined his
ship
, and
had received
sailing
orders, compelled him to quit his
appointment, throw up his
commission
, and follow his
unprincipled wife to this place. Lord M. has a
seat
at Alnwick, which is only a
short
ride from hence,
and Courtney having obtained
sufficient
testimony
of
her depravity and his own
dishonour
, came to me,
and
asked
my advice in what manner he
should
proceed
.
See your wife,
said
I, and
remonstrate
with
her. I will go with you. He
seemed
inclined to
follow
my advice, and we rode together toward this
place. When we had proceeded a few miles, we
saw
a chariot and four driving
suriously
along; the
liveries
bespoke
it the equipage of lord M. Courtney no
sooner
saw
it, than, clapping
spurs
to his
horse
, he
gallopped
from me, and before I could get up with him,
had
stopped
the carriage in which was Mrs.
Courtney
and his
Lordship
. The irritated, impetuous
husband
had dragged the ignoble peer from the carriage,
and, drawing a
case
of
pistols
,
presented
him one,
whilst
with the other he prepared to defend
himself
,
when one of the footmen
struck
him
across
the head
with the end of a whip, and he fell
lifeless
to the
ground. Lord M.
sprang
into his carriage again and
drove off, leaving me with my
servant
to take what
care we could of poor Courtney. We were nearer
this place than we were to Alnwick, and placing him
on the
horse
before John, with great difficulty we got
him here. This
house
is kept by a woman who
nursed
my wife; and as I thought he would be quieter
and better attended here than in a public inn, I had
him brought hither. The wound on his head is deep,
but the
surgeon
does not think him in
so
much
danger
from the effect of that as from the violent
perturbation
of his mind.
Rachel
listened
with
astonishment
to this detail, and
was
so
entirely
absorbed
in reflection on the
strange
incidents Oliver related, that when the
mistress
of the
house
entered, and
requested
to know what her
commands
were,
she
had totally forgotten the
circumstance
that had brought her to the
house
. She
hesitated
,
blushed
; at length,
casting
her eyes on the
breakfast
table,
she
saw
the object of her inquiry; but
the
consciousness
of her
embarrassed
, awkward
appearance
,
so
increased
her
confusion
, that the inquiries
she
made for her tablets had more the appearance of
subterfuge
than truth. However, the maid having
mentioned
that Mr. Oliver had picked them up in the
garden
,
they were delivered to our heroine, who, having
expressed
a
desire
to
see
Courtney, and
promised
to
return
in the afternoon for that
purpose
, took her leave.
Now, though Rachel did not know five
persons
in
the neighbourhood where
she
dwelt, even by
sight
, yet
she
was
herself
known by every individual in it; and
her
embarrassed
and
hesitating
manner, added to a
knowledge of the evil reports which were circulated
concerning her, led the woman where Oliver lodged,
to imagine
she
came to
visit
him, or Courtney, as
she
seemed
so
perfectly acquainted with both.
In the afternoon, Rachel determined to
see
Courtney
.
She had no idea that impropriety could be
annexed
to a
visit
which
she
conceived to be an act of
duty; and when
she
found him
so
extremely ill as to
need the
most
constant
and tender attention; when
she
discovered
that it was in her power to
soothe
his
afflicted heart, and
smooth
the bed of pain, by an
exertion
of friendly
assiduity
; forgetting every thing but
that
she
had once been under obligations to him,
she
resolved
herself
to be his attendant till he
should
recover
strength
sufficient
to enable him to return to his
mother and
sisters
. Thus every morning
she
repaired
to the chamber of the
sick
man,
nursing
him with
the affection of a
sister
, and
administering
to him the
consolation
of a friend.
Mrs. Spriggins and her unprincipled
guest
were
mean enough to employ their
servants
to inquire in
the neighbourhood after our heroine, and be
constant
spies
upon her actions. That
she
was often, nay,
almost
continually at the
house
where Oliver was, and
where Courtney lay
sick
, they were
assured
of; and
though they knew that
she
constantly
returned to her
solitary
apartment to her meals, which were
scanty
enough, and that
she
was always at home at an early
hour in the evening, yet they failed not to attribute to
motives the
most
degrading to the
sex
, a conduct which
was the
result
of pure benevolence, and did honour to
her heart, however it proved, that her head was not too
much
stored
with worldly prudence and knowledge.
Things were exactly in this
situation
, when
Hamden
Auberry arrived in
search
of a woman, whom,
one moment, he was ready to kneel and
worship
, and
the next, to call down
everlasting
wrath upon her.
It may
easily
be imagined, that the
story
told by
Mrs. Spriggins, Mrs. Courtney and family did not
tend to
soften
his heart towards her;
so
far from it,
he poured forth a torrent of execrations, and vowed
never to
see
her more. But when he had returned to
his inn, and
mused
a few moments, he thought he
would
see
her once more, upbraid her, and bid her an
everlasting
farewel; he had learnt in what quarter of
the town
she
lodged, and at the
dusk
of the evening
went to the
house
and inquired for her. She was not
at home. At eight o'clock he called again;
still
she
was not returned. Having obtained a direction to
the
house
where he was told
she
spent
every day, and
having
assured
himself
that was the
residence
of Oliver,
he determined to keep watch before the door, and
be
himself
an eye-
witness
of her leaving it, and at
what hour. Long and
wearisome
was the night, and
horrible were the feelings of Auberry. About twelve
o'clock, he determined to leave her to her fate, and
return with all
speed
to London; but before he had
reached the inn,
desire
of revenge impelled him to
return
.
`I will tear her from the arms of Oliver,'
said
he, `and wreak my vengeance on both her and her
paramour;' but then the memory of his child
crossed
his imagination, and with it the fond recollection of
what the mother was when he
first
knew her; a flood of
tenderness
rushed
over his
soul
, and he wept like an infant.
In this
distracted
manner did Auberry
pass
the night,
and the dawn of day found him
sitting
on the
steps
of a
door
opposite
to the lodgings of Oliver. He
rose
from
the cold, damp
seat
, and with a heavy heart was
giving
a
last
look at the
house
, when the door opened
gently, and Rachel
herself
, with her child in her arms,
came out.
Though during the whole night Hamden had
supposed
his wife was there, yet
something
like hope had
sometimes
led him to think he might have been
deceived
,
and
she
might
still
be innocent; but this ocular
proof was beyond all doubt. He reeled
against
a
post
,
staggered
and fell.
Rachel
saw
him; but, wrapped in a
coarse
great
coat which he had borrowed at the inn, with his hat
flapped, it was
impossible
, by the faint glimmer of the
twilight,
she
should
know him;
she
imagined it to be
an inebriated
person
,
just
endeavouring to return
home; and fearful,
should
she
be
observed
by him at
that early hour, that he might in
some
respect
or other
be rude to her,
she
quickened her
steps
, and before
Auberry was
sufficiently
recovered to
speak
or
rise
from the ground,
she
was out of
sight
, and in a few
moments reached her own habitation. A little girl,
who was up on
some
particular
occasion
, let her in,
and
she
threw
herself
on the bed, in hopes to obtain
some
repose
, while Auberry returned to the inn,
penned
a
hasty
letter to her, which he left, with orders that
it
should
be
sent
by eight o'clock in the morning. He
then ordered a
chaise
and four, and proceeded with
all the rapidity of
such
a conveyance to London,
seldom
stopping
even for
refreshment
, as though he
thought, by the velocity of the movement, to leave
his cares behind, or
lose
the remembrance of them, by
attending to the various objects that
passed
in quick
succession
before him.
In the mean time, Rachel had enjoyed about two
hours
sleep
, and felt
herself
greatly
refreshed
; for the
fatigue and anxiety of the night had
exhausted
both
her
spirits
and
strength
. She had attended as
usual
the day before at the
bedside
of Courtney; towards
noon he had
arisen
, and was removed for the benefit
of the air into an adjoining apartment, and placed in
an
easy
chair near the window. The
noise
of
horses
drew his attention towards the
street
. He looked out,
and
saw
his wife, accompanied by lord M. on
horseback
,
attended by two
servants
in rich liveries. She
raised
her eyes,
saw
the emaciated figure of her
husband
,
pointed him out to her
dissolute
companion,
and both
burst
into a loud laugh. Courtney was
unequal to the
shock
; he attempted to
speak
, but his
voice failed him; he
gasped
, groaned, and fell to the
floor. Alarming faintings
succeeded
each other, and
he was reduced to
such
a
state
of
weakness
, that the
medical gentleman who attended him imagined it
almost
impossible
that he
should
live through the night.
Was it
possible
for Rachel in
such
a
situation
to leave
him? No! She had not been treated with
sufficient
respect
by the
mistress
of the
house
where
she
lodged,
to make her think it
necessary
to
send
any
message
to
her concerning her
staying
out, or her
reasons
for
so
doing.
Towards morning, Courtney fell into a quiet
sleep
,
and Oliver entreated Rachel to retire, and endeavour
to take
some
repose
. Acting from motives the
most
pure and even commendable, without a thought or
wish
in the
smallest
tittle derogatory to virtue, Rachel
had no
apprehension
of incurring
censure
from any.
How
surprised
was
she
then, on awaking in the
morning
,
to read the following note, which was brought
to her by the little girl who had let her in.
Misstress
Dakirs, ater the adventer of
last
nite, you
cant
suppos
I will
suffer
you to
stay
any longer in my
ouse
, wich is a
onest
ouse
; and furdermore, I does
not expect you to go without paying me every fardin
of what you oes me. You
must
go meditly, as I does
not want women of your
sort
in my
ouse
no longer.
Rachel was really
so
totally
unconscious
of evil,
that
she
was at a
loss
to think what the woman meant
by the adventure of
last
night; but going to her to
inquire, was
so
overwhelmed with
abuse
, that, weeping,
trembling,
almost
fainting,
she
retreated from the
house
leaving every thing behind her to
satisfy
the
rapacity
of her inhuman landlady.
As
she
was going out of the door,
she
met the porter
with her
husband
's letter. She took it, broke the
seal
, and read that he had been there, that he had
seen
her, that he believed her
lost
to virtue, and that he
abandoned her forever. Overcome by
sensations
the
most
agonizing,
she
sat
down on the
steps
of the door.
The letter remained open in her hand; her eyes were
riveted to it, and only that
she
breathed,
she
might
have been taken for a
statue
of fixed and mute
despair
.
How long
she
would have remained in this
situation
is uncertain, or whether,
sinking
into
insensibility
,
she
would not have
lost
all
consciousness
of her
misery
,
had not the woman with the diabolical malice of a fiend
opened the door, and bade her begone from the
step
.
Aroused
from her lethargy of grief,
she
arose
, folded
her child to her
bosom
, and bowing her head in meek
resignation
, the
sorrows
of her heart found vent at her
eyes, and
she
obeyed in
silence
.
And what was there, in this moment of
anguish
, to
support
the
sinking
spirits
of our afflicted heroine?
Conscious
innocence! And
whilst
humbled to the
very
dust
,
she
could look up with hope and confidence
to Him who is a rock of defence to the injured, a
sure
help to
those
who
trust
in him.
Wounded pride would have
first
impelled her to
hide
herself
from Oliver, as
she
discovered
, from the
unconnected
scrawl
left by Auberry, that it was of
him he was jealous, and had it been only for
herself
that
she
was
interested
,
she
would
most
likely have
suffered
every degree of
misery
before
she
would have
asked
relief of any one; but her child, the
son
of
Auberry
,
the lawful heir to large
possessions
, for his
sake
she
was
resolved
to
stifle
her feelings, and endeavour
to convince his cruel father that he had injured her in
the
most
unwarrantable manner.
She therefore went immediately to his lodgings,
and calming her perturbed
spirits
as much as
she
possibly
could, thus
addressed
him:Mr. Oliver, I
am
necessitated
to
request
the loan of a few guineas,
at the
same
time that I tell you it is more than
probable
I may never be able to repay you. Something
has taken place this morning, which obliges me in
future
to forbear
seeing
you, or giving any farther
attendance
on our unfortunate friend.
Good heavens!
said
Oliver,
struck
with her pale
countenance,
swollen
eyes and evident agitation;
what can be the matter? Wherever you are going,
do not
refuse
me the
satisfaction
of knowing, that I
may be able to
assist
, protect, comfort, be a brother to
you.
It is
impossible
,
said
she
, the world will not
suffer
it.
He comprehended the meaning of her words, and
without reply tendered her his
purse
. She took five
guineas from it, and then
requesting
to
see
Courtney,
of whom
she
took a
silent
leave,
she
departed, leaving
Oliver
astonished
and affected at her conduct. He
mused
a few moments, and then thinking, however
rigid propriety might forbid her to
visit
the
house
he
F f
inhabited, or receive
visits
from him, yet it did not
forbid
him following and
discovering
her retreat, where
he might
supply
her with all the
necessaries
and
comforts
of life. He
snatched
his hat, and
rushed
into the
street
; but he was too late; Rachel was no longer in
sight
, nor could he
discover
which way
she
had gone.
Our heroine walked to a poor cottage about a mile
from the town, inhabited only by an old woman and
her daughter. Here
she
agreed to board at a very
low rate for a few days, and then
sat
down to write
to her
husband
. She endeavoured to explain
circumstances
that appeared
suspicious
; but to think that
Auberry
suspected
her honour, gave her
such
inexpressible
anguish
, that
she
was frequently obliged to
lay down her pen and weep. At length
she
finished
,
earnestly
conjuring, if not for her own, yet for his
child's
sake
, he would
send
her
some
relief, nor
suffer
them to expire with want, or
languish
out their lives
in poverty and
obscurity
.
This letter
she
directed to a coffee-
house
in London,
which
she
knew he frequented, and
requesting
an
answer
to be directed to the
post
-office at Newark,
she
left her infant in the charge of her old
hostess
, went
herself
and put her own letter in, inquiring at the
same
time when
she
might expect an
answer
.
When
she
returned to her humble home, fatigue,
anguish
of heart, and the violent emotions
she
had
experienced
during the day, had
so
far overcome her,
that
she
went to bed much
indisposed
, and after a
night of
restless
agitation,
she
awoke from a
short
slumber
so
ill, as to be unable to
rise
.
From that time, a period of three weeks was a
total
blank to Rachel. A fever, accompanied by a
delirium
,
brought her to the verge of the grave; but the
tenderness
of her good old
hostess
and her daughter,
co-operating with a naturally good
constitution
, and
the attendance of a
skilful
man of medicine, at length
triumphed over the
disorder
, and
she
returned to life
and a renewed
sense
of her
sorrows
.
The
first
thing
she
thought of was her expected
letter. She
dispatched
the young cottager to
Newark
to inquire for it;
she
returned empty handed;
there was no letter there. Thus day after day
passed
on. The five guineas Rachel had borrowed of
Oliver
were totally expended during her
illness
, and no
letter arriving from her
husband
,
she
was once more
pennyless
, but not totally
friendless
. The poor
inhabitants
of the cottage were
Christians
. Had
she
been
stained
with a
thousand
errors, they would not have
thought it right to remember them when
she
was
bowed
to the earth by affliction. Their whole
possessions
were, the cottage, a
small
garden, a cow and two
spinning
wheels; but they dried the tear from her eyes by
the voice of
kindness
, and told her
she
should
be
welcome
to
share
their humble fare till returning health
enabled her to join their labours for
subsistence
, if
nothing better offered. During her
illness
, the old
cottager had found Auberry's letter, and
wishing
to
gain
some
intelligence concerning her family, had
perused
it.
She may be guilty,
said
she
, but I have no
right to judge her. She is
sick
and afflicted; it is
therefore my duty to
nurse
and comfort her. She
then returned the letter to the pocket from whence
she
took it, nor even after Rachel's recovery did
she
suffer
her to imagine, by any word, look or hint, that
she
had
seen
it.
As
soon
as Rachel had gathered
strength
sufficient
to enable her to attempt it, with
slow
and uneven
steps
she
proceeded to Newark, determined to make
inquiry
herself
concerning a letter; for
she
thought it
impossible
for Auberry to abandon her and his child to
absolute
want.
She went to the office, and was told no
such
letter
was there. Are you certain, Sir?
said
she
; it
must
have been here
some
time, if it is here at all.
Pray look
amongst
the letters that lay in the office;
it is of more
consequence
to me than you can
imagine
.
It is directed to Mrs. Dacres, to be left here till
called for.
A young man hearing her repeat the name of
Dacres
,
turned over a parcel of letters, and
presented
to
the trembling hands of our heroine the long-expected
epistle
from her
husband
.
Rachel opened it; a hundred pound bank note
dropped from it! She attempted to read it, but a
mist
came over her eyes;
she
reeled, and would have
fallen, but the young man caught her. He called
for water, and an interior door opening, a young
woman, very plainly habited,
rushed
out,
supported
and
pressed
to her
bosom
the
lifeless
, inanimate form,
calling on her to revive by the tender name of friend,
her dear, unhappy Rachel. Life
soon
revisited
her
lips and cheeks;
she
opened her eyes, and found
herself
in the arms of
Jessy
Oliver.
Leaning on the arm of this dear friend, and hardly
daring to
trust
her
senses
lest
it
should
prove an
illusion
,
Rachel retired into a
small
, neat parlour, where
she
soon
regained
sufficient
composure
to
peruse
her
letter. It was
short
, and the
conclusion
of it
almost
annihilated her. It was as follows.
My adored Rachel
,
THERE is
such
an appearance of candour and
sincerity
throughout your whole letter, that I cannot
but believe you innocent; prove
yourself
so
, and on
the receipt of this come immediately to London, and
prepare to follow my fortunes to foreign climes. Our
marriage is no longer a
secret
; my aunt has
discarded
me. I have
sold
my
commission
, and in the
despair
I felt at your perfidy, have taken
passage
on board
a
vessel
bound for Philadelphia. If you love me as
you
say
, and as I would fain think you do, you will
not
hesitate
to leave England forever,
since
it is for
my peace of mind that I
should
do
so
. I cannot
submit
to live in it below the rank I have been
accustomed
to fill. If your affection leads you to be the
companion
of my voyage, the
sharer
and
soother
of all my
cares, I
shall
regret neither fortune nor country. If
not, if
some
stronger
attachment binds you to this
spot
,
Oh Rachel! I cannot bear the thought; but
should
it be
so
, why the farther we are divided the better.
Inclosed
I imagine is a
sum
sufficient
to
discharge
any debts you may have contracted, and bring you to
London. If you come, I
shall
expect to
see
you in
ten days from the date of this letter. If not, farewel
forever; we meet no more on this
side
eternity, and
I will
strive
if
possible
to forget you.
HAMDEN AUBERRY.
Rachel referred to the date of the letter; it had been
written near a month. Then he is gone! left me
forever! and thinks me the
most
depraved of women,
said
she
; and her emotions became
so
violent, that in
her
present
debilitated
state
,
Miss
Oliver feared
she
would have fallen into fits; at any rate,
she
thought
it
necessary
to take her home, and procuring a
carriage
,
she
herself
accompanied her to her lowly
habitation
.
By the way
she
talked her into
something
like
composure
;
she
learnt every
circumstance
that
had taken place
since
their
separation
.
Convinced of the purity of our heroine's heart, that
her motives had been always right, though her
conduct
had been
sometimes
directly contrary to the rigid
rules of prudence,
she
felt all her affection for her
revive
;
and taking her hand when
she
had
finished
her
detail,
she
cried, Well, Mrs. Auberry, (as we
shall
henceforth call Rachel) in return for the confidence
you have
reposed
in me, I will tell you my
story
. It
is a very
simple
one, without one romantic or
extraordinary
incident.
When I left London, I recollected an old
school
fellow I had at this place, of
whose
sense
and
discretion
I had a very high opinion; to her I repaired, and
through her means
settled
the method of
corresponding
with you and Archibald,
also
the means of
receiving
a
small
yearly income, which I
possessed
independent
of my father. I then threw
aside
the fine
lady entirely,
assumed
the plain attire you
see
me now
wear, and with it a
simplicity
of manners that might
be likely not to betray my real rank in life. I then
procured an apartment at a farm-
house
, that is
situated
in a
most
delightful though very
solitary
valley,
F f 2
about three miles from hence. I
purchased
a few
books, with materials for needle-work, and
diversified
my time with reading, working, and taking
necessary
exercise
. The productions of my needle, through my
friend were
sent
to London and
sold
,
increasing
my
little income in
such
a manner as to afford me all the
comforts of life. I heard of my brother's marriage,
and of his
residence
so
near me. I longed to
see
him;
but was too proud to think of throwing
myself
on the
liberality of his wife, for I knew that Archibald
himself
was as poor as I was. I therefore continued my
retirement and avocations. I have frequently thought
of you, and from
some
accounts which accidentally
met my ears, was led
sometimes
to blame but oftener
to pity you.
But
should
I ever return to the gay world, my
young
associates
will, I have no doubt, be
surprised
that I
should
have eloped from my father's
house
,
changed my name, and
secluded
myself
above a year
and a half in a cottage, yet never have met with a
single
adventure, or made one
conquest
; nay, if you
will believe me, the impenetrable
rustics
have entirely
overlooked my beauty and
accomplishments
; and
though I have appeared regularly every Sunday, when
the weather permitted, at the
parish
church, the Squire
has not once noticed me, and I have remained entirely
unmolested
.
But I am weary of this dull
sameness
of
scene
,
and you and I will now
set
out together in
search
of
adventures. This mad brained, harum-
scarum
husband
of yours, though I think he little
deserves
such
attention from us, yet we will e'en go after him. For
if we
should
not find him, we may perhaps find
somebody
else
that will be glad to
see
us.
Rachel comprehending that
Jessy
meant Reuben,
replied with additional
pensiveness
, Alas! my dear
girl, I have never heard from my brother
since
he left
England.
So I
understand
,
said
Jessy
,
still
forcing a
smile
,
while her eyes were brimfull of tears; but I cannot
repress
a fond hope, which
almost
amounts to a belief,
that he is
still
in
existence
, and that we
shall
one day
meet again. As to Archibald, it will not be proper
to let him know of our
design
till it is too late for him
to overtake and accompany us; for that would
overthrow
my whole plan of reconcilement between you
and Auberry. And
should
the
worst
come to the
worst
, there is
still
my little annuity; we will live
together
,
my dear Rachel, in humble, but contented
independence
.
What our income will not procure,
industry
shall
supply
. We will
study
to fulfil the duties
of our lowly
station
, and, enjoying the
sweet
consolation
of an approving
conscience
, hold the trifling
multitude
,
that is in general termed the
world
, in
so
little
estimation
, as neither to court its
smiles
or fear its
censures
.
This was a plan too agreeable to the feelings of
Rachel
not to be immediately
closed
with. This
re-commencement
of
friendship
, with a
person
so
dear to her
heart as
Jessy
Oliver,
seemed
to
ease
her
bosom
of half
its load. A very
short
time
sufficed
for the
settlement
of every concern, either of
Miss
Oliver or our
heroine
,
and on the
second
morning after their meeting
they were on their road to London. Rachel left
ample
testimony
with her aged
hostess
at the cottage,
that whatever her other errors might have been,
she
was not guilty of the
sin
of ingratitude. Arrived in
London, they made every inquiry after Auberry, and
learnt that he had been departed above a fortnight,
and it was
universally
believed to America.
It was late in the
season
for
vessels
to
cross
the
boisterous
Atlantic ocean; the two fair friends could hear
of none likely to
sail
to the port they
wished
, under a
month or
six
weeks. This appeared to the anxious
and impatient Rachel an eternity; and being
informed
that a
ship
would go from Liverpool in the
course
of ten days, they
pursued
their journey for that place,
and arrived
just
in time to
secure
a
passage
, as the
vessel
was to
sail
the following morning.
Reduced as our heroine was by
illness
, this long
journey was almost too much for her
strength
; but
Jessy
Oliver had fine
spirits
, and a
constitution
which,
though not
robust
, could
support
great fatigue
without
sinking
under it. They alighted at the inn, and
resolved
to indulge in a few hours
rest
before their
embarkation
,
where we will leave them and make
some
little inquiry after Auberry.
When he had
dispatched
his letter with the money
to Rachel, he waited with the
utmost
impatience the
arrival of the time in which he might expect her. He
had in the
first
hurry of
jealousy
, rage and
disappointment
sold
his
commission
, and taken a
passage
on
board a
ship
bound to Philadelphia, determined never
more to
visit
his native country, where every bright
prospect
of his youth had been untimely
blasted
. The
reception of his wife's letter awakened all his
tenderness
for her. Rachel in want,
depressed
,
sick
,
brokenhearted
,
was ever before his eyes. `She may yet be
innocent,' cried he; the very
supposition
seemed
to
give him comfort; `yet the proofs of her depravity
were
so
incontestable
' here his heart glowed with
resentment
; `I will at
least
send
her the means of
coming immediately to me. If
she
comes, I will
receive
her with affection, if not, I will endeavour to
forget
that I ever knew her.' In this frame of mind he
wrote the letter which conveyed the money to our
heroine
.
But when day after day
passed
, and no tidings of
her neither by letter or any other means, he
concluded
she
was totally abandoned, and in
despair
of ever
knowing peace again, he embarked on his intended
voyage. But
tempestuous
weather
ensuing
, and the
brig in which he embarked being rather ancient,
sprung
a leak, and they put into Liverpool to refit;
where Auberry, giving way to the
despair
that
preyed
upon his mind,
sunk
into a
state
of inanity. Both
mind and body became debilitated; a hectic fever
slowly
undermined his
constitution
; and when the
vessel
was ready to depart, he was too ill to make the
voyage, and
suffered
her to go without him. He
had gone to his mother immediately on his arrival in
Liverpool, where he explained to her all his
cause
for
sorrow
, and felt every wound bleed
afresh
as he
perused
some
letters from Belle
Webster
, which tended
highly to criminate his wife. Doctor Lenient was
absent
at the time of his arrival; a
small
estate
had been
left him in Ireland, and he had
crossed
the channel in
order to take
possession
and
settle
some
very material
business
.
When Hamden had been with his mother about
three weeks, the Doctor returned,
surprised
to
see
his
nephew, and more
surprised
at his very rueful
appearance
.
He inquired what he had been doing to alter
himself
so
. I have been ruining
myself
,
said
Auberry
.
Odso
! I hope not, replied the good-hearted
Doctor
,
What, have you been gambling?
Yes, in the lottery of life, and have drawn a blank.
In
short
, my dear uncle, I have married a woman
without
either family or fortune, and am
discarded
by my
aunt; but that I could have borne, had my wife been
faithful.
Odds my life!
said
the Doctor, matrimony
seems
no improver of
happiness
; for this is the
second
tale of
misery
I have heard to-day. What think you,
sister
?
just
as I landed from the packet, I
saw
two
women
standing
on the
shore
, ready to
step
into a boat
that was waiting. One countenance I knew
instantly
;
for though pale and greatly emaciated, there was
still
that character of
sensibility
and virtue
impressed
upon
it for which I
used
to admire it. It was our
unfortunate
young friend Rachel Dudley.
Hamden
gasped
for breath, but he
suffered
the
Doctor
to proceed without interruption. She had a fine
boy in her arms, continued the Doctor, apparently
about four months old, and
spite
of all we have heard,
I felt
myself
impelled to
speak
to her. Her
companion
was
Miss
Oliver, whom we heard had eloped from
her father's
house
, and who has not been heard of by
her family for above a twelvemonth.
Well, Sir, cried Auberry impatiently, but
what of Rachel.
Why I'll tell you,
said
the Doctor, taking off
his wig and deliberately putting on his
crimson
velvet
cap, and without noticing the emotions of Hamden;
when I went up to her, and
asked
her how
she
did,
she
laid her hand on her
bosom
, and with a look I
shall
never forget,
answered
, Neither well nor happy,
Doctor.
I am
sorry
, my poor girl,
said
I, for
some
circumstances
that I
understand
have taken place, and
knowing your extreme
sensibility
, cannot be
surprised
that they have injured both your health and peace of
mind. But where are you going now?
To America,
said
she
, in
pursuit
of my
husband
.
You are married, then,
said
I.
Yes,
she
replied, and fixing her eyes on my face,
did you not know it?
No, how
should
I? I have been in Ireland
these
two months
past
.
Just
then the
sailors
called to her
to get into the boat. She tendered me her hand.
God
bless
you, my good Doctor,
said
she
. I
shook
her hand, helped her in, and
And
she
is really gone, then, cried Hamden
frantickly.
The Doctor
raised
his eyes; the agitated
countenance
of his nephew alarmed him. Yes, I believe
so
,
said
he in a doubtful tone; but why does it
affect
you thus?
Why does it affect me? Oh! Sir, I am the
husband
of Rachel! It is me
she
is gone in
pursuit
of.
I have
deserted
, abandoned,
forsaken
her; I thought
her depraved; I was told
Yes, and
so
have I been told,
said
the Doctor
with vehemence,
striking
his hand on the elbow of his
chair; but after beholding her meek,
expressive
countenance, where candour and purity are
stamped
on
every feature; after
seeing
her emaciated frame, and
hearing her tremulous, plaintive accents, I would not
believe the
smallest
tittle to her
disadvantage
, though
millions joined to affirm it! Young man, you have
been
hasty
, and blinded by
passion
; have thrown away
a pearl of
inestimable
price.
Hamden's feelings were now too great for utterance.
His mother
soothed
him; but Dr. Lenient, who hated
family pride, blamed the whole of his conduct; and
though before he went to bed he
prescribed
something
to
compose
the agitated
spirits
of Auberry, yet when
retired, his thoughts were wholly occupied by Rachel,
wandering without a proper protector, in
search
of a
man who had wantonly
sacrificed
her
happiness
and
reputation on the altar of ambition and
interest
.
CHAPTER LAST.
Where heaven-born Freedom holds her court
Let me erect my humble
shed
;
Where all the arts with joy
resort
,
And Science rears her laurell'd head.
We
left Reuben in captivity, employing every
leisure
moment in expanding the mind and
cultivating the talents of Eumea. In this manner
six
weary months
passed
on, and
still
no hope of
emancipation
.
At the end of this period, tidings arrived
that the Indian chiefs had been guilty of a breach of
the European laws, and in
consequence
had
suffered
death. The
sachem
called a council of his elders and
chiestains
, and it was determined that Reuben and his
unhappy companions
should
on the
ensuing
morning
be bound to the
stake
, and
suffer
those
inhuman
tortures
which none but
savages
could inflict, and none
but
savages
submit
to, without an endeavour to be
avenged of
those
who inflict them.
Eumea was in the wigwam at the time this horrid
sentence
was
passed
; her heart
sunk
; there were but
a few hours to intervene before it was to be put in
execution
.
In the dead of night,
she
entered the
wigwam
of our hero.
Englishmen
,
said
she
, awake, get up; danger
and death are at hand;
haste
, quit this place, flee into
the woods that
skirt
the mountains, and the God of
the
Christians
go with you. In a few words
she
explained
to them the
necessity
of their immediate flight,
and directing their
steps
to a cavern in a hollow glen,
she
threw her arms round the neck of Reuben, bathed
his cheek with her tears,
pressed
her cold trembling
lips to his, and
sobbing
, Adieu! returned to her
restless
bed to weep and pray for his
safety
.
Innumerable were the
hardships
endured by
Reuben
and his companions,
skulking
in caves, or deep
woods, feeding on wild fruit, and even glad to make
a meal of acorns; terrified by the
rustling
of the
leaves, or the
steps
of wild though
inoffensive
animals,
natives of the uncultivated tracts through which they
were obliged to
pass
.
After three weeks
wearisome
journey, they at length
arrived at a European
settlement
; but
so
reduced
through famine and fatigue, that it
seemed
as though
they were only arrived at a place of
safety
that they
might
rest
from all their cares in death. Even the
strength
and
spirits
of O'Neil began to flag, and he
bitterly regretted that he was no longer able to cheer,
attend and comfort his dear
master
.
But what was the
surprise
of Reuben, when, the day
after his arrival at this place, he
saw
Eumea enter the
apartment where he was. He
raised
himself
from the
bed on which he was reclining, and in a voice that
expressed
at once
surprise
and
pleasure
, exclaimed,
Eumea
here! what
strange
incident! She
stopped
him,
took hold of his hand, and looking
earnestly
in his
face
Is it
strange
that I
should
follow you; (
said
she
)
were not you my
instructor
, my more than father, my
friend, and was it
possible
Eumea could
stay
behind
you and live? Do not look angry; I know I have
done wrong; for you taught me to love,
respect
, and
never
forsake
my father and mother. I tried to
remember
your precepts, I tried to obey your
injunctions
;
but, alas! the
silent
night was
witness
to my
anguish
, and the
rising
sun
could not dry the dew from
my eyelids. If I
slept
, I
saw
you,
listened
to you,
and was happy. Fleeting joy! that but embittered
the moment of awaking! The flowers you had
gathered
for me the day before you left me, I bound upon
my
breast
next my heart; I have worn them there
ever
since
; they withered and dried, but every day I
refresh
them with my tears. One morning,
just
as
the day appeared, I
arose
, took my bow and arrows,
and
resolved
to follow you. My mother was
still
asleep
; I looked at her, I knelt
beside
her; but I
dared
not
kiss
her
lest
she
should
awake. I would have
prayed, but you had told me that an undutiful child
could never be a favourite of our heavenly Father;
so
I
pressed
my hands on my heart, which throbbed
so
loud, it
seemed
to
say
, Oh! God of the
Christians
,
bless
my mother! God knows every thought of the
heart, and though I dared not pronounce his
sacred
name with my lips, perhaps its
silent
petition may be
read and
answered
.
Eumea
paused
; Reuben would have
answered
, but
he was at a
loss
what to
say
. O'Neil, weak and ill
as he was, had moved towards her, and
sitting
at her
feet, leaning one hand on her knees, his head
rested
on it, and his languid eyes were fixed on her face, as
he
listened
to her with profound attention.
It is my belief,
said
he, that God Almighty
never turns away from the prayers of an innocent
heart; and then to be
sure
he knows all we want,
when we can't
speak
to
ask
for even a
morsel
of brend.
Oh! if we were only to have what we
deserved
, we
should
find but poor accommodations, in our journey
through this world; but you
see
he was
so
good as to
send
people before us, to make every thing
comfortable
;
and all he requires is, that we
shall
in return
make things
pleasant
and agreeable for them that
come after us.
Reuben could not help
smiling
at O'Neil's
morality
.
Eumea
seemed
lost
in thought, and
scarcely
to
have attended to what he
said
; but when
she
found
he was
silent
,
she
again
addressed
our hero.
So you
see
here I am; but what have I gained
by following you? Nothing! for now all that I
sufered
before for your
absence
, I now feel on account
G g
of my mother. But I will not return. No; I could
not
support
my father's
unkindness
, and my mother's
reproaches, which would be the more painful
because
mingled with affection. I will follow you, my dear
instructor
, I will be your handmaid, and love and
serve
you to the
last
hour of my life.
And
so
will I,
said
O'Neil, and I'll well
serve
you too, my beautiful Indian lady, every day and all
the day, and by night too, if
so
be there be
necessity
.
And how did you know that you
should
find me
here?
said
Reuben.
I knew,
she
replied, that this was the
nearest
settlement
, and had I not found you here, I
should
have travelled onward to Philadelphia; and had you
not been there, I
should
have thought you had died
by the way, and would have
sought
you in a better
world, the world of
spirits
.
You would not, I hope, Eumea, have dared to
rush
unbidden into eternity?
said
Reuben.
I fear I
should
,
she
replied; for why
should
we
endure life, when the nights are
past
in
anguish
, and
every day is a day of
sorrow
? When the wintry
blasts
howl, when the
snow
falls, and the
frost
binds up the lakes:
then, when confined to the wigwam, there is no comfort
within, but the
tempest
of the
passions
rages more furious
than the gale that bows the tall cedars, and
shakes
to the
roots the
stately
oak; why
should
we not
sleep
with
the infect or the reptile tribes, that
pass
the dreary
season
in
insensibility
? And when the warm
southern
breeze
dissolves
the ice, and bids the trees be green,
the
blossom
come; when the blackbird
whistles
merrily
,
and the robin begins to
dress
his plumes; if then
nor fragrant
blossom
, nor cheerful bird, nor
flowerspeckled
field delight the
sense
, or
soothe
the tortured
soul
, were it not better to
seek
repose
in other climes,
more
suited
to our feelings? Or when the deer
seeks
the deep woods, and pants though lying on the
river's
brink, when the
scorching
sun
dries the
grass
and
parches up the ground, where is the harm if, plunging
in the wave, we quench the fever that
consumes
us,
or from our veins let out the blood, that
rushes
with
such
fury through our frame,
swelling
the heart till
it is near to
bursting
? Or even when the
season
of
corn arrives; when
clusters
of wild grapes hang on
the bending vines; when the berries, blackened by the
sun
, peep through the half-faded leaves; when the
cool,
soft
breeze of evening, and the
sweet
air of the
morning, affords
refreshing
slumbers
to the eyelids, or
uncloses
them to
pleasing
prospects
, that, being
surveyed
,
makes the heart dance with joyAh! then,
if the eyes are dimmed with tears and the heart
oppressed
with
sorrow
; is it a
sin
to
seek
that happy
place where we can neither weep nor
suffer
more?
You have profited but little by my
instructions
,
Eumea,
said
Reuben, if you can argue thus.
I will follow you, then,
said
she
emphatically,
and endeavour to improve.
In about a fortnight, our hero and his companions
were enough recovered to continue their journey. It
was in vain he entreated Eumea to return to her
mother,
she
persisted
in following him. It was
without
effect that he
represented
to her, that in
accompanying
him
she
would be looked upon with
disrespect
by the European women; her
resolution
was taken
and was not to be
shaken
.
The appearance of Reuben and his followers was
miserable
in the extreme when they entered
Philadelphia
;
and what added to their
misery
was, that
amongst
them all they had not a
single
copper, nor any friends
to whom they could apply for
assistance
. The
forlorn
group had
crossed
the Schuylkill, and with weary
steps
were approaching the city, when a venerable
man of the
society
of Friends, riding out for
exercise
and air,
surveyed
them with an eye of
compassion
,
and
stopping
his
horse
Friend,
said
he,
addressing
Reuben, both thou and thy companions
seem
fatigued
,
and appear to have taken a long journey;
from whence
dost
thou come?
From captivity,
said
Reuben.
Yes, cried O'Neil, who, having recovered his
usual
spirits
,
pushed
forward to
speak
for
himself
;
yes, we have been obliged to pay a pretty long
visit
to the copper-coloured gentlefolks, and if we had not
come away as we did, they would have
scalped
us and
roasted
us, and then a pretty figure we
should
have
cut! But this dear creature, who, though
she
is a
little
darkish
or
so
, has a heart as beautiful as an angel;
so
she
told us what they were about going to do.
Said
she
, Get up, my lads, and run away
whilst
you
can; for to-morrow you will have no legs to run with.
So away we came, and a fine
trampoose
we have had.
And now we have got here, I don't know that we are
much better off; for if they had
roasted
us, we
should
not a lived to be
starved
to death; for a devil a penny
have we got to buy bread.
Nevertheless
,
said
the benevolent friend, thou
shalt
not
starve
. I am not rich; but Heaven forbid
that I
should
suffer
a fellow-creature to want while I
have a
morsel
to give him, or a blanket to
spare
to
shelter
him from the inclemencies of the weather. I
have a
house
on the banks of the Delaware, but a very
short
distance
from the city, and its doors were never
shut
against
the unfortunate; come home with me,
then, and bring the good Indian maiden with thee.
It matters not to what nation, kindred or people they
belong who are in affliction; I feel they are my
brethren
,
and as
such
, I will gladly
share
my own comforts
with them.
They heard with delight the genuine
effusions
of
mercy and benevolence flow from the lips of the man
of peace, and being directed by him,
pursued
their way
to the habitation of
hospitality
.
A
small
mansion
, built by frugality and
furnished
by
simplicity
,
situated
on the banks of the Delaware,
and
surrounded
by a large and well-cultivated garden,
was the dwelling of
Stedfast
Trueman. Elizabeth his
wife was not
handsome
, but there was
something
in
her look, voice and manner, more charming than
beauty. Her
house
, her children,
herself
, were pure
emblems of
neatness
, innocence and
industry
. She
heard that
some
poor
guests
were arrived, directed to
their friendly roof by her
husband
, came into the
kitchen to bid them welcome, and with her own hands
assisted
to
set
forth
refreshment
. The children came
round them,
some
eagerly curious and
inquisitive
, and
others timidly
standing
aloof, to
observe
the
strange
dress
and appearance of the travellers.
In this
asylum
, Reuben and his companions
soon
recruited both health and
spirits
. Their benevolent
friend
supplied
them with
some
coarse
clothing, the
joint product of his farm and his wife's
industry
. In
the
course
of
conversation
our hero mentioned his
father's
name.
Dudley,
said
friend Trueman; I knew him
well; a more worthy,
honest
man never
existed
.
If thou art his
son
, thou
hast
, I fear, been greatly
wronged by the man Jacob Holmes. I have
reason
to
believe thy father was a man of
strict
integrity, and
that he would not premeditatedly
assert
a
falsehood
.
He did declare to me in confidence every particular
of his
past
life, and though he did not
boast
of his
good deeds, yet I gathered enough to believe that
Jacob
was the child of his bounty. But the man has
since
so
boldly and
solemnly
contradicted that belief,
that I dare not judge too
rashly
; and Heaven forbid
that I
should
condemn him; for,
just
or
unjust
, he is
gone to give an account of his
stewardship
before
Him, who, requiring but humility,
justice
and mercy
from his
servants
toward their fellow-creatures, will in
no
wise
excuse
those
who
slight
his
counsels
, or break
his commandments.
Reuben was
surprised
. Is Jacob Holmes then
dead?
said
he.
Verily he
sleepeth
with his fathers,
said
Trueman
.
He was greatly hurt about three months
since
, by a fall from his
horse
; the
bruise
was
internal
,
brought on a
spitting
of blood, which baffled all
medical aid, and he went off
suddenly
, when he
supposed
himself
mending. Indeed, I was told he never
believed
himself
in danger. More is the pity; the rod
of affliction, that warns us of approaching
dissolution
,
is a
salutary
and
necessary
judgment, that as we bow
under the correcting hand, we may implore that
mercy
which is never withheld from the penitent
sinner
.
G g 2
And who inherits his
estate
?
said
Reuben.
His infant
son
, who with his mother,
still
resides
in the
house
.
Mrs. Holmes is a worthy woman,
said
Reuben,
and
possesses
an
honest
simplicity
of heart extremely
interesting
. Oh bounteous
Disposer
of events,
continued
he, and his
soul
expanded as he
spoke
,
visit
not, I humbly
beseech
thee, the
sins
of the father upon
the child; but may he live to be a comfort to his
mother, a friend to the worthy, and thy faithful
servant
to a good old age.
Thy pious prayers, good young man,
said
Trueman
,
return tenfold on thy own head.
The unfortunate participators of Reuben's captivity
being recruited, departed in
search
of employment;
but
himself
, O'Neil and Eumea were detained in the
habitation of friend Trueman, who
wished
to place our
hero in
some
reputable employ, meant to detain O'Neil
in his own
service
, and thought the food and raiment
necessary
to render the Indian maid comfortable, would
never be
missed
by his own family. The inquiries he
set
on foot for employment for our hero made it
universally
known that he was returned to Philadelphia.
One morning, as he
sat
conversing
with Trueman,
he was
surprised
by the entrance of Mrs. Holmes. She
advanced to him with a firm but eager
step
, and
presenting
her hand, I am glad to
see
thee, friend
Reuben
,
said
she
; I did not hear of thy return till
yester
even, or I
should
have come to
visit
thee before.
Our hero cordially
shook
her proffered hand, led
her to a
seat
, and told her he was happy in an
opportunity
to renew their acquaintance.
I expect thou
dost
know already that Jacob Holmes
is gone home,
said
she
, her
bosom
heaving and her
eyes
swimming
in tears. Reuben bowed
assent
.
Thou
hast
no right to regret his departure,
continued
she
, but he was the
chosen
friend of my heart,
the father of my child, the
support
of his family; his
loss
to me is irreparable. She
paused
a moment. I
have,
since
his departure,
she
continued, recovering
her voice,
discovered
amongst
some
old papers, which
I do dope and believe he had never
inspected
, the
attested
copy of a will, and other accounts of
consequence
to thee. Here they are; thou wilt find by
them that thou art the real
possessor
of Mount
Pleasant
.
I am
sure
I could not be happy to detain it
from the lawful owner, and I here
relinquish
all claim
to it, and throw both
myself
and child upon your
benevolence
.
She then untied a handkerchief, and
delivered
the papers into the hands of Reuben,
whose
feelings on the
occasion
cannot
easily
be
described
.
Our hero, thus
raised
almost
instantaneously
from
extreme poverty to a
state
of
ease
, and indeed (what
in
those
days of moderation was termed) affluence,
made it his
first
care to place Mrs. Holmes and her
son
in a comfortable habitation, and to
settle
upon
them one third of all his father died
possessed
of. He
placed Eumea with her, who
assiduously
endeavoured
to conform to the European
dress
,
customs
and
manners
;
but
she
pined at being
separated
from Reuben,
and if more than two days
elapsed
without her
seeing
him,
she
would give way to the
most
violent affliction.
Our hero had, previous to his campaign
against
the
Indians, frequently written to his
sister
; but
these
letters
being directed to the care of Mr. Andrew Atkins,
were never forwarded to our heroine; indeed, after
the
first
, he might have pleaded in
excuse
that he did
not know where to find her.
Reuben made every inquiry at the
post
-office, and
of the
masters
of
vessels
then arriving from England,
for letters, but could hear of none
addressed
to
himself
;
and he meditated a voyage to his native place,
in order to bring his
sister
over, and
sometimes
indulging
the fond hope, that
Jessy
Oliver might accompany
her. But as he had much to
settle
previous to
taking
so
long a voyage, he deferred it till the
ensuing
spring
.
His friend,
Stedfast
Trueman, had made a
purchase
of
some
land
situated
in New-
Jersey
, near the mouth
of the Delaware; he thought it
necessary
to
visit
it
this autumn, and plan out the improvements he meant
should
take place in the
spring
. He invited Reuben
to accompany him on this
excursion
, and he,
wishing
to
see
a little of that part of the country,
assented
.
Their journey was extremely
pleasant
; but on the
day preceding that they had
settled
for their return to
Philadelphia, a cold
storm
,
such
as often precedes or
accompanies the
sun
's autumnal
passage
across
the
equinox, commenced, and they
resolved
to tarry till
its fury was abated. On the evening of the
second
day, it was
increased
to a tremendous degree, not
blowing
steadily
, but in
gusts
, that threw the ocean into
horrible
convulsions
, heaping up
vast
mountainous
waves that
seemed
to threaten heaven, and leaving
hollow
chasms
, in which the
vessels
(which they could
plainly
descry
from the windows of the
house
they
were in)
seemed
often to be
lost
, though in a moment
after they appeared again on the
summit
of the
highest
wave.
Friend Trueman and our hero were greatly
affected
at the evident
distress
in which
several
small
barks
appeared; they
stood
anxiously
watching them, till
the curtain of night
shut
them from their view. The
house
they were in was
situated
at the entrance of Great
Egg-Harbour; and as the
storm
abated in
some
trifling
degree towards morning, Reuben and his friend
arose
with the
earliest
dawn, to
see
if any
signs
of
wrecks were apparent, or if they could be of any
service
to the
suffering
mariners, who might, if luckily
they
escaped
such
a
catastrophe
, be in want of friends
and
assistance
. They wrapped
themselves
in their
great coats, and walked towards the
sea
, where they
presently
descried
a
ship
dreadfully
shattered
,
endeavouring
to make the harbour. Her
foremast
and
foremat">foremast
and
main-top-mast
were gone;
some
of her
sails
, torn in atoms,
were fluttering in the wind, and the few
she
could
expand
were
scarcely
manageable.
Long they laboured, for
some
hours
opposed
both
by wind and tide; at length the latter turned in her
favour, and
she
fetched in, but not without making
repeated
signals
of
distress
; and it was very evident, as
she
approached the
shore
, that
she
laboured heavily in
the water, and all the
spectators
concluded
she
was in
danger of
sinking
. The
sea
ran
so
high, no boat
could, without imminent
risk
, go to the
assistance
of
the wretched crew. At length a
fishing
boat
ventured
off. The people on board had thrown out an
anchor
,
but
she
dragged it, and the wind
setting
across
the harbour,
she
was making
stern
foremost
to the
shore
.
Just
as the boat reached her,
she
struck
, and
the cries of the affrighted
sailors
and
passengers
reached
the ears of
those
who
stood
on the
shore
, waiting
in
suspense
and horror to behold the fate of
so
fine a
ship
and her unfortunate company. Several women
were
seen
on the deck, and the
spectators
seemed
as
though they could have given their own lives to
preserve
the lives of the
sufferers
.
When the boat reached the
ship
, the people
rushed
over the
sides
into her; the women were helped in,
and in a few moments their
situation
was as perilous
from having overloaded the boat, as it had been
before
in the
vessel
. However, they put off, and made
towards the
shore
; the wind favoured them, and the
spectators
exultingly cried, In five minutes they will
be all
safe
; but in a much
less
time, a
sudden
flaw
took the
sails
; from the number of
persons
on board,
the
fishermen
could not flack the
sheets
in time, and
she
overset
.
All the aim of
those
on
shore
was now to
save
, if
possible
, the lives of
some
, who, borne by the foaming
surge
,
seemed
almost
to reach the land, when the
receding
wave would
dash
them back into the dread
abyss
of waters. Spars
fastened
by ropes were thrown
into the
sea
, while a number of men on
shore
stood
ready to drag them to land,
should
any
despairing
wretch
seize
them as the means of deliverance.
Reuben
was
busied
in this humane endeavour, when he
heard a
shout
of exultation from a group of men
employed
in the
same
manner at a little
distance
. They
waved
also
for more help. He therefore quitted his
own party, which was more numerous, and ran to
their
assistance
, when he perceived that two women
had been already
snatched
from a watery grave, and
several
men were, by the help of the
spars
, near the
shore
.
Here,
said
the
master
of the
house
at which they
lodged, here, take this poor infant, and carry it to
the
house
, bid my dame make up a large fire in every
room, and get all the beds ready. You
must
sleep
on
the floor to-night, Sir.
Reuben
clasped
the poor little dripping infant to
his naked
breast
, wrapped his coat round it, and was
delighted to find, by a faint moaning
noise
it made,
that in all probability it would recover. He ran to
the
house
, gave the child into the care of a kind
hearted
Negro wench, and then returned to help the two
women. One was entirely
senseless
, for
she
had
dropped
on the very moment
she
reached the
shore
; the
other was unable to walk or
speak
, but yet could make
signs
that her
senses
were perfect. Reuben
assisted
to
carry them in, gave them in charge to the women of
the
house
, and then returned to the
sea
side
; but
soon
perceiving nothing more was to be done, he came
back to inquire after the little traveller.
The women are both recovered,
said
a man, as he
entered the
house
.
I am glad of it,
said
Reuben; might I be
admitted
to
speak
to them; they are no doubt
English
women, and will rejoice to find a countryman
so
near
them, who is willing and ready to render them any
service
.
This
message
was carried to the ladies, and in a
moment
he was admitted. They were in
separate
beds
in the
same
room. Reuben drew near that which was
next the door; the
person
who occupied it
raised
herself
partly, and exclaiming, It is! it is my
brother
!
threw
herself
into his arms, which,
sinking
on the
bed
beside
her, he had extended to receive her; for the
moment he beheld her face, he recognized his
sister
,
and the exclamation of `Dear Reuben!' `beloved
Rachel
!'
mutually
escaped
their lips as they
burst
into a
flood of tears.
And what were the feelings of
Jessy
Oliver at this
moment? they were
indescribable
. She folded her
hands over her face, and the
silent
tears trickled
through her fingers. Rachel recovered articulation
first
. Reuben,
said
she
, there is a dear friend of
both yours and mine; 'tis
Jessy
Oliver, who has been
my friend, my
supporter
, my more than
sister
.
Reuben left his
sister
, and dropping on his knees by
the
bedside
of
Jessy
, drew her hands from her face,
and feeling more at that moment for her
kindness
to
his
sister
, than from any other motive,
pressed
them to
his heart, and cried, May Heaven forever
bless
you.
The
ensuing
scene
may be conceived, but cannot be
described
. Reuben
discovered
, from the lamentations
of his
sister
, that it was her infant he had brought to
the
house
(
she
had dropped it at the moment of
landing
when her
senses
failed her, and imagined it
drowned
)
and he had the
exquisite
pleasure
of
restoring
it to
her arms.
A few days
reinstated
their health and
spirits
, and
our hero, with his friend
Stedfast
Trueman,
escorted
the happy Rachel and
Jessy
to Philadelphia. The
former
explained every
circumstance
of her marriage,
and its
subsequent
consequences
; and the latter when
solicited
to become
mistress
of Mount
Pleasant
, did
not frown or threaten to be obdurate. They arrived
at friend Trueman's
house
about midday, and after
taking a
slight
refreshment
, Reuben, with his
sister
and
her charming friend, proceeded to Mount
Pleasant
.
They were met at the gate by O'Neil.
Och! my dare
master
,
said
he, I'm mighty
glad you are come back, for here has been a
strange
sort
of a gentleman here, and for the matter of that
he is here now, in our
house
, but he is
sick
;
so
as he
seemed
to love your honour, and talk kindly of my
good lady your
sister
that I have heard your honour
speak
of, I put him into the
best
chamber, and
sent
for
a doctor, and I hope your honour won't be angry,
because
you
see
I did as if I had been in your honour's
place.
O'Neil would have gone on, had he not
seen
a
chaise
approach (for Reuben was on
horseback
). And
be
these
visitors
?
said
he.
Yes, replied our hero, and the very
sister
you
spoke
of, and a charming lady, who I hope will
soon
become your
mistress
, O'Neil.
The
honest
, affectionate O'Neil
stayed
not to reply;
he darted forward, and
seemed
as if he would have
helped the
horse
that drew the
sister
of his beloved
master
. When the carriage
stopped
, he waited not
for ceremony; but as
Jessy
stood
on the
side
of the
chaise
ready to alight, he
seized
her in his arms, and
bore her into the
house
; then running back, took the
child from Rachel, (whom Reuben had helped out of
the
chaise
)
almost
devoured it with
kisses
, and leaping,
dancing and capering, cried, Yes! yes! he will be
happy after all, I knew he would, I was always
sure
he would. O that my dear
Mistress
Juliana was but
alive now!
Perhaps the reader has before this
surmised
, that the
strange
,
inquisitive
,
sick
gentleman was no other than
Hamden Auberry, who had embarked for
Philadelphia
immediately after his knowledge of our heroine's
seeking
him in that place; but the
ship
in which he
embarked being a
fast
sailer
, and
steering
a different
course
to that
pursued
by the one in which was his
wife, arrived
safe
in the port of Philadelphia the very
night before the commencement of the
storm
in which
poor Rachel
suffered
so
much, and
so
nearly
escaped
with life. His
first
inquiries were for Reuben, and he
was directed to Mount
Pleasant
; on his arrival there,
he learnt that Rachel was not arrived, and that
Reuben
was
absent
from home. Change of climate, the
fatigues of a long voyage, and the
anguish
of mind he
had endured for
six
months
past
, had
so
enervated
his frame and
shook
his
constitution
, that when he
attempted
to remount the
horse
that brought him, he
turned
so
faint as to be obliged to return to the
house
,
where he grew
so
much
worse
, that O'Neil (as he
had told his
master
)
advised
him to go to bed, and
sent
for a doctor.
The meeting between our heroine and her
husband
was all that real affection and
sensibility
can imagine.
Rachel wept, and regretted the pain
she
had
unintentionally
given him,
whilst
he implored her pardon for
that
false
pride, which had
first
exposed
her to the
suspicions
and
insults
of
those
who, envying her
superior
merit, rejoiced in an opportunity to level her with their
own contaminated ideas.
About
six
weeks after this happy meeting, Reuben
received the hand of
Jessy
Oliver. It was a day of
festivity
. The gates of Mount
Pleasant
were thrown
open, and every
visitor
made welcome. To add to
their mirth, a dance in the evening was to
finish
the
entertainment.
A
social
meal,
dispensed
with
cheerfulness
, and
partaken
with a true
spirit
of hilarity, had been
just
removed
,
when the parlour door
hastily
opened, and
Eumea
entered. Her hair hung
loose
about her
shoulders
;
her eyes were wild, aud her voice broken. She
rushed
toward Reuben and
Jessy
, and taking a hand
from each, joined them; then
pressing
them to her
bosom
,
raised
her eyes to heaven
God of the
Christians
,
said
she
fervently, make
them forever happy. Wife of Reuben, thou art a
happy
woman, for thy
husband
is a man of honour. He
saw
the
weakness
of a poor, unprotected Indian maid,
he pitied her folly, but took no advantage of it.
Jessy
was affected by the
simple
yet fervent
address
.
Reuben took the hand of Eumea, and would have
made her
sit
down, but
she
refused
.
No! no!
said
she
, Eumea will
rest
no more,
know peace no more. I had
raised
a deity of my own,
built an altar in my
bosom
, and daily offered the
sacrifice
of a fond, an affectionate heart; but the days
are
past
, I can
worship
no longer without a crime.
Farewel,
said
she
,
enthusiastically
elasping
her hands,
do not quite forget the poor, poor Eumea!
She then left the
house
, and Reuben
sent
a
person
to follow and
see
that
she
came to no ill. She went
home, but continued not long there; a young woman,
who from her wild looks and incoherent language
imagined her mind to be
disordered
, endeavoured to
detain her, but in vain. About the
dusk
of the
evening
she
went out, and all inquiry for her was
fruitless
H h
till three days after, when as Reuben was giving
some
orders to O'Neil, in that part of his ground that lay
on the verge of the Schuylkill, they
discovered
something
floating on the water; the garments
bespoke
it
a woman. Reuben's heart
shuddered
; they dragged
it to the
shore
; it was the
corpse
of poor Eumea.
Reuben
sighed
,
raised
his eyes to heaven, but was
silent
.
Not
so
O'Neil. He fell on his knees
beside
the pale
corse
, and his
honest
heart
burst
in a torrent from his
eyes.
Och! my flower of the
forest
,
said
he, and art
thou gone, and was it love that made thee leave us?
Beautiful, good,
sweetest
of
savages
O! thy poor
O'Neil can pity thee. And what
shall
he do now thou
hast
closed
thine eyes? Thou
hast
murdered thy
sweet
self
, and what is there now in the world that he cares
for?
Reuben was
struck
with the fervency and humility
that was at once
expressed
by O'Neil; for it
spoke
as
plain as words could
speak
, `I loved her, but I never
dared to tell my love,
lest
it
should
offend her.'
Our hero by degrees drew him from the
contemplation
of the melancholy object, and proper forms being
gone through in regard to the body, it was buried in
a field near the margin of the river. O'Neil banked
up the grave,
twisted
osier
twigs and fenced it round;
at the head he planted a weeping willow, and at the
foot a wild
rose
tree. Of a night when his labour was
finished
, he would
visit
the
spot
,
sing
old ditties, and
weep
whilst
he
sung
; and though he lived to good old
age, O'Neil never knew another love.
After this period, our heroine for many years
enjoyed
an uninterrupted
series
of felicity. Auberry,
entirely
occupied by the cares of a mercantile life, into
which he had
successfully
entered, and giving every
leisure
moment to the
assisting
of Rachel in the education
of a beautiful
rising
family, was entirely cured of
jealousy
and ambition, and wondered he could have ever
doubted the faith of his wife, or have
risqued
losing
so
vast
a
treasure
forever, rather than
relinquish
the hope of being rich and great.
Reuben and
Jessy
were patterns of conjugal felicity,
and that felicity was
increased
in the
course
of a few
years, by the arrival of old Mr. Oliver, Archibald and
Courtney. The former had
saved
a trifle from the
wreck of his fortune, which had been
almost
dissipated
by a
worthless
woman. Archibald brought with him
an amiable bride in the
person
of Courtney's
sister
.
The abandoned Mrs. Courtney had met the fate her
vicious
course
of life merited, and died abroad,
neglected
by all her pretended lovers, a victim to
disease
,
poverty and
remorse
.
It was in the
seventh
year of our hero and heroine's
happy
settlement
in Philadelphia, that the latter was
told one morning that a gentleman from England
desired
to
see
her. She went into the parlour, and
beheld
,
to her infinite
surprise
, Mr. Allibi.
Mrs. Auberry, I
presume
,
said
he, bowing
profoundly
.
I am happy, Madam, to be the
first
to
wish
you joy on a very great and unexpected
accession
of
fortune. Your
husband
's relation, lady Anne, is dead;
also
her brother the Earl, and I may now
salute
you
Countess
of Montmorill. Moreover, continued he, not
giving her leave to
speak
, I am to inform you, by
order of Mr. Andrew Atkins, that
yourself
and
brother
,
Mr. Reuben Dudley, being the only
descendants
of the lady Arrabella Ruthven, who married about
the year 1644-5, with Edward Dudley,
son
of Henry
Dudley,
descendant
of the unfortunate lady Jane Grey,
and who
relinquishing
her title, embarked with him
for America; as I
say
,
yourself
and brother being the
only legitimate
descendants
of that marriage, you are
acknowledged joint heirs to the titles and
immense
estates
of the
house
of Ruthven. And I am
commissioned
by my very good friend, Mr. Andrew Atkins,
to receive your orders in what manner he
shall
proceed
in regard to
said
estates
, and to inform you, your
Lancashire
estate
is now, through his care, entirely free
from incumbrances.
Rachel, overwhelmed by the rapidity with which
Allibi related all this good news, and
scarcely
crediting
what
she
heard, yet
understanding
sufficient
,
perfectly
to comprehend the mean
finesse
of Allibi and his
dirty employer, in thus informing her of her
accession
of fortune, and making a merit of
relinquishing
the
Lancashire
estate
, in hopes of being made agent and
steward
to
those
of much greater value, could
scarcely
command her temper,
whilst
she
interrogated him
concerning
the extraordinary intelligence he conveyed.
However, being
ascertained
of the truth of his
assertions
,
and received from him
some
papers of
consequence
,
with a long,
fulsome
, congratulatory letter
from Mr. Andrew Atkins,
she
appointed him to call
the
ensuing
morning, when her brother and
husband
would be
sure
to meet him.
On the following morning, therefore, at a little
past
eight o'clock, Mr. Allibi entered the
breakfast
parlour,
where he found Reuben, Rachel, Mr. Auberry and
Mrs. Dudley
assembled
to
breakfast
. After partaking
a
social
meal, and delivering and
attesting
to every
necessary
paper, both in regard to their new
acquisitions
and the
Lancashire
estate
, he was
somewhat
astonished
to hear Reuben
address
him in the
following
words:
You may think, Mr. Allibi, that by bringing us
this intelligence you have greatly heightened our
felicity
;
and in one
respect
you have, as it extends our
power of
serving
our fellow-creatures. As to titles,
both my brother Auberry and his wife Rachel, join
with me to renounce them; they are
distinctions
nothing
worth, and
should
by no means be introduced into
a young country, where the only
distinction
between
man and man
should
be made by virtue, genius and
education. Our
sons
are true-born Americans, and
while they
strive
to make that title
respectable
, we
wish
them to
possess
no other. Let the titles then go, and
such
of the
estates
as are annexed to them, to more
distant
branches of our
several
families, or in
case
of
default of heirs, let them
sink
into oblivion. Of the
immense
property of which we are become
possessors
,
we
shall
retain no more than will
set
our
sons
forward
in
business
, and give our daughters moderate portions;
the
residue
shall
be equally divided
amongst
the
indigent
relatives of both families.
Allibi brightened at
these
words, thinking he
should
be
constituted
agent in this
business
; but Reuben
continued
:
I am obliged to you for the trouble you have
taken
on my account, and hold
myself
your debtor for
the
expenses
of your voyage and other contingencies,
which, whenever you
please
, I
shall
be ready to
discharge
;
and when you return, I will trouble you with
a letter to Mr. Andrew Atkins, informing him he will
be no farther troubled with my affairs, but will
please
to
settle
all accounts with Mr. Courtney, a gentleman
who has kindly undertaken to go to England for that
purpose
.
The poor,
disappointed
Allibi could
scarcely
breathe
at the
conclusion
of this
speech
; he
shuffled
on his
seat
,
attempted to recommend
himself
by reprobating the
conduct of Atkins, but a look of marked contempt
from Reuben
silenced
him; and, mortified beyond
endurance
,
he
rose
hastily
and took his leave.
In a
short
time, Courtney embarked for England,
settled
every thing according to the directions of
Reuben
and Auberry, made many an orphan glad, and
many a
disconsolate
heart leap for joy. He liberated
the poor debtor,
assorded
relief to
depressed
merit, and
wiped away the tear from the eye of
suffering
virtue.
The
incense
of gratitude
ascended
towards heaven,
and was returned in
blessings
on the heads of Reuben,
Rachel, and their
posterity
.

.S
IT is with
satisfaction
of the
purest
kind, that I
take up my pen to inform my dear aunt Rachel and my
beloved children, that the
business
which brought me to
this place is at length
finished
, and the completion of
it is equal to my
most
sanguine
expectations.
The
purchase
of the land, (which is delightfully
situated
on the banks of the Schuylkill, within a
pleasant
ride of Philadelphia) the building of the
house
,
barn,
stable
, &c. in
such
a
style
as might unite a
degree
of
simple
elegance with convenience, the
stocking
the farm, and other contingencies, have led me
rather to exceed the
sum
I
first
sat
out with, though
that was greatly augmented by trade; and I have
been
necessitated
to give bills on England for five
hundred
pounds; but they are at
such
a date as will
enable
me to reach home before they become due, or
should
I not, I have given my agent, Mr. Atkins,
instructions
to
sell
part of the
Lancashire
estate
, if he has
not in his hands money
sufficient
to pay the bills
without
.
You will, therefore, without
hesitation
,
acquiesce
in whatever arrangements he may make for that
purpose
.
I intend embarking for England about the end of
October, and hope to
see
you all before the new year
commences.
I
suppose
my darlings, Reuben and Rachel, are
almost
grown out of knowledge. I would have
answered
their letters, but time
presses
. I am
pleased
with their evident improvement in writing and
orthography
.
Tell Reuben here will be an ample field for
his
aspiring
and
inquisitive
genius. Tell him, at the
same
time, I
wish
him ever to
aspire
to be eminently
good; for that only can render him eminently great.
Tell my
dearest
Rachel, that if
she
emulates the
virtues
and perfections of her
sainted
mother,
she
will be
every thing that is amiable. Fare thee well. May
the Creator and
Preserver
of the
universe
guard,
protect
,
and keep you all.
R. DUDLEY.
P. S. I
shall
leave Jacob Holmes in care of my
estate
here. I
shall
also
leave him a trifle to put him
in a little way of
business
, that by prudence and
industry
he may render
himself
independent. The man
who depends for the
necessaries
of life on a patron,
can never
assert
that freedom of
spirit
which is the
natural prerogative of every human being. Jacob is
serious
,
assiduous
, and
serupulously
conscientious
in all
his dealings. I have placed an unlimited confidence
in him, and am firm in the belief that he will never
abuse
it. Once more, God
bless
you.To
ARCHIBALD OLIVER,
Esq
.
WHEN the altar is decorated, the
priests
at hand,
and the knife is
raised
, that will terminate
existence
,
who can blame the poor victim devoted to
sacrifice
, if
it break the chain by which it is held,
asserts
the
privilege
of nature, and, bounding over the plain,
secures
at once both life and liberty? Brother, beloved
brother
,
they have prepared the altar, but the
destined
victim
will
escape
their
snares
.
Deliver the
inclosed
to the friend of my
soul
, Rachel
Dudley; if
she
contemn me, I will return a voluntary
sacrifice
. For
so
pure is her mind,
so
unprejudiced
her opinions,
soaring
so
far above the common herd,
that I would abide by her
decision
even in a
cause
of
life and death.
Dearest
Archibald, though I am driven to the
dreadful alternative of marrying the man I
despise
, or
quitting the paternal roof, do not you
forsake
our
father
.
I
solicit
, I conjure you, my brother, in the name
of our
sainted
mother,
forsake
not our only remaining
parent. I fear he will
soon
, very
soon
,
stand
in need
of a comforter. I will be
constant
in my inquiries
concerning his welfare, and whenever I find my
presence
necessary
to his peace or comfort, I will appear.
Any thing but truth I would have
sacrificed
for his
sake
. Could you
see
my heart at this moment, you
would pity the
anguish
I feel in bidding you adieu,
perhaps forever.
JESSY OLIVER.To
Miss
DUDLEY.
WILL my dear friend pardon me that I intrude
myself
upon her, and by explaining my
sorrows
, make
her a party in my concerns? I have
suffered
much
persecution
, dear Rachel,
since
we parted; and to
avoid
rushing
at once into guilt and
misery
, I have
taken a
step
for which the world will
censure
me. But
what is the world to me? Had I voluntarily
assumed
the
splendid
shackles
prepared for me, had I become a
titled wretch, and
promised
faith and truth to one
man,
whilst
every
wish
, every tender thought of my
heart was devoted to another, would the approving
smiles
of that misjudging world, the adulation it is ever
ready to pay to
splendor
and nobility, have
compensated
for the
sacrifice
I
should
have made of internal
peace, of
conscious
integrity? No.Admired,
courted
,
envied, I
should
still
have been
miserable
. The
baseness
of my conduct would be my daily reproach;
I
should
have
sought
to
banish
reflection by
dissipation
,
and who can tell where the career of guilt and folly
might have
stopped
?
I have endured both
stern
commands and
soft
entreaties
;
I have been
soothed
and threatened
alternately
.
That I might with more
security
follow the
plan I had
previously
adopted for my future conduct,
I pretended (Heaven pardon the deceit) to accept the
husband
my
dissolute
and ambitious mother-in-law had
provided for me, and to-morrow morning I am
expected
to put on the Hymeneal yoke, and become a
countess
. But before the appointed hour arrives, I
shall
be far, far out of the reach of their tyranny. Let
not my
sweet
friend,
whose
bosom
is the
sacred
temple
of purity,
sear
that I
shall
forget what is due to
myself
.
That I am
strongly
attached to a worthy youth,
I
seruple
not to
confess
; but he is a
stranger
to my
passion
, and in all human probability will ever remain
so
; for never will
Jessy
Oliver offer
herself
unsolicited
to the acceptance of any man. My affections are pure
as they are ardent; but the name of the object of them
shall
never
pass
my lips, or
escape
my pen. I fly from
proffered wealth and grandeur, to
obscurity
; even
from you, my dear Rachel, I will
seclude
myself
.
Were I happy or affluent, you
should
be my
chosen
companion, the partner of my heart. But I am the
reverse
, and will
suffer
alone. If you will
condescend
to receive and
answer
the letters of a fugitive, I have
formed a plan by which we may regularly
correspond
;
but do not flatter
yourself
that by that means you can
trace me; nor do not, I entreat you,
suffer
my brother
to know the means by which my letters are conveyed.
And now, my
dearest
Rachel, adieu! Fear not for
me. I will never
dishonour
the name of my father,
or forget the virtue of my
sainted
mother. Perhaps
(my heart
sinks
at the idea, but perhaps) I
shall
never
see
you again. If
so
, may Heaven
shower
its
choicest
blessings
on you, and
inspire
me
with patience and
fortitude
to
submit
, without repining, to an affliction
which would lacerate the heart of
JESSY OLIVER.My adored Rachel
,
THERE is
such
an appearance of candour and
sincerity
throughout your whole letter, that I cannot
but believe you innocent; prove
yourself
so
, and on
the receipt of this come immediately to London, and
prepare to follow my fortunes to foreign climes. Our
marriage is no longer a
secret
; my aunt has
discarded
me. I have
sold
my
commission
, and in the
despair
I felt at your perfidy, have taken
passage
on board
a
vessel
bound for Philadelphia. If you love me as
you
say
, and as I would fain think you do, you will
not
hesitate
to leave England forever,
since
it is for
my peace of mind that I
should
do
so
. I cannot
submit
to live in it below the rank I have been
accustomed
to fill. If your affection leads you to be the
companion
of my voyage, the
sharer
and
soother
of all my
cares, I
shall
regret neither fortune nor country. If
not, if
some
stronger
attachment binds you to this
spot
,
Oh Rachel! I cannot bear the thought; but
should
it be
so
, why the farther we are divided the better.
Inclosed
I imagine is a
sum
sufficient
to
discharge
any debts you may have contracted, and bring you to
London. If you come, I
shall
expect to
see
you in
ten days from the date of this letter. If not, farewel
forever; we meet no more on this
side
eternity, and
I will
strive
if
possible
to forget you.
HAMDEN AUBERRY.
