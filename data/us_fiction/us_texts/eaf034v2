LETTER XXIX.
Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
I AM
sometimes
mortified to find
the books which I recommend to your
perusal
, are not always applicable to the
situation
of an
American
lady. The general
observations
of
some
English
books are the
most
useful
things contained in them; the
principal parts being chiefly filled with local
deseriptions
, which a young woman here is
frequently at a
loss
to
understand
.
I SEND you a little work, entitled
A Lady
of Quality's Advice to her Children
which,
though not altogether free from this
exception
,
is highly worthy of your attention. A
parent who is
represented
struggling
with the
distress
of a lingering
illness
, bequeaths a
system
of education to her offspring. I do
not recommend it to you as a Novel, but as
a work that
speaks
the language of the heart
and that inculcates the duty we owe to
ourselves
,
to
society
and the Deity.
DIDACTICK
essays
are not always capable
of engaging the attention of young ladies.
We fly from the laboured precepts of the
essayist
, to the
sprightly
narrative of the
novelist
.
N
Habituate your mind to remark the
difference between truth and fiction. You
will then always be enabled to judge of the
propriety and
justness
of a thought; and
never be
misied
to form wrong opinions, by
the meretricious
dress
of a
pleasing
tale. You
will then be capable of deducing the
most
profitable
lessons
of
instru
ction, and the
design
of your
reading
will be fully
accomplished
.
HENCE you will be provided with a key to
the characters of men: To unlock
these
curious
cabinets is a very
useful
, as well as
entertaining
employment. Of
those
insidious
gentlemen, who plan their advances towards
us on the
Chesterfieldian
system
, let me
advise
you to beware. A prudent commander
would place a double watch, if he
apprehended
the enemy were more
disposed
to take the
fort by
secresy
and undermining, than by an
open
assault
.
I CANNOT but
smile
sometimes
, to
observe
the ridiculous figure of
some
of our young
gentlemen, who affect to
square
their
conduct
by his
Lordship
's principles of
politeness
they
never tell a
story
unless
it be very
short
they talk of decorum and the
etiquette
they
detest
every thing vulgar or
common
they
are on the rack if an old man
should
let fall a proverband a
thousand
more trifling affectations, the ridicule of
which
arises
, not
so
much from their putting
on this foreign
dress
, as from their
ignorance
or vanity in pretending to imitate
those
rules which were
designed
for an
English
nobleman
Unless
, therefore, they have a
prospe
ct of being called by
Congress
to
execute
some
foreign negociation, they ought
certainly to be minding their
business
.
THIS affectation of fine breeding is
destru
ctive
to morals.
Dissimulation
and
insincerity
are connected with its tenets; and
are mutually inculcated with the art of
pleasing
.
A PERSON of this character grounds his
motives for
pleasing
on the
most
selfish
principleHe is polite, not for the honour
of obliging you, as he endeavours to make
you believe, but that he
himself
might be
obliged.
Suspe
ct him, therefore, of
insincerity
and treachery, who
sacrifices
truth to
complaisance
, and
advises
you to the
pursuit
of an object, which would tend to his
advantage
.
ALWAYS
distinguish
the man of
sense
from the coxcomb. Mr.
Worthy
is
possessed
of a good
understanding
, and an exact
judgment
.
If you are united with him, let it
be the
study
of your life to
preserve
his love
and
esteem
. His amiable character is
adorned
with
modesty
and a
disposition
to
virtue and
sobriety
. I never anticipate your
future
happiness
, but I contemplate this
part of his character with
pleasure
. But
remember the fidelity of a wife alone, will
not always
secure
the
esteem
of a
husband
;
when her
personal
attractions do not
continue
to delight his eye,
she
will flatter his
N 2
judgment. I think you are enabled to
perform
this,
because
you are
solicitous
to
supply
your mind with
those
amiable qualities
which are more durable than beauty. When
you are no longer
surrounded
with a
slattering
circle of young men, and the world
shall
cease
to call you beautiful, your company
will be courted by men of
sense
, who know
the value of your
conversation
.
I AM
pleased
with the conduct of fome
agreeable
girls, and the return of civility and
attention they often make to the conceited
compliments of a certain
class
of beaux.
These
ladies
wisely
consider
them as the
butterflies
of a day, and therefore generally
scorn
to break them on a wheel!
WHEN you are in company, where the
vain and
thoughtless
endeavour to
shew
their ingenuity by ridiculing particular
orders
of men, your prudence will dictate to
you not to countenance their
abuse
The
book I have
just
mentioned, intimates, that
there are a great many things done and
said
in company which a woman of virtue
will neither
see
nor hear.To
discountenance
levity, is a
sure
way to guard
against
the
encroachment of temptation; to participate
in the mirth of a buffoon, is to render
yourself
equally ridiculous. We owe to
ourselves
a
detestation
of
solly
, and to the world, the
appearance
of it. I would have you avoid
coquetry
and affectation, and the
observance
of
my maxims will never make you a prude
Pretend, therefore,
should
a vain youth throw
out illiberal
sarcasms
against
Mechanicks,
Lawyers,
Ministers
, Virtue, Religion, or any
serious
subje
ct, not to comprehend the
point of his wit.
I HAVE
seldom
spoken
to you on the
importance
of Religion, and the veneration due
to the characters of the Clergy. I always
supposed
your good
sense
capable of
suggesting
their
necessity
and eligibility. The
Ministers
of no nation are more remarkable
for learning and piety than
those
of this
country. The fool may pretend to
scorn
,
and the irreligious to contemn, but every
person
of
sense
and reflection
must
admire
that
sacred
order,
whose
business
is to
inform
the
understanding
, and regulate the
passions
of mankind. Surely, therefore, that
class
of men, will continue to merit our
esteem
and affection, while virtue remains
upon
earth.
I AM always
pleased
with the
reasonable
and amiable light in which the Clergy are
placed by the author of the
Guardian
The light,
says
he, in which
these
points
should
be
exposed
to the view of one who is
prejuced
against
the names,
Religion, Church,
Priest
, or the like, is to
consider
the Clergy
as
so
many
Philosophers
, the Churches as
Schools, and their Sermons as Lectures for the
improvement and information of the
audience
.
How would the heart of
Tully
or
Socrates
have rejoiced, had they lived in a
nation where the law had made
provision
for
philosophers
to read lectures of
philosophy
,
every
seventh
day, in
several
thousands
of
schools
, erected at the publick charge,
throughout the whole country, at which
lectures, all ranks and
sexes
, without
distinction
,
were obliged to be
present
, for their
general improvement?
YOU may, perhaps, think this letter too
serious
, but remember that virtue and
religion
are the foundation of education.
Adieu!
LETTER XXX.
Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
You
will
observe
, my dear
friend, that
most
of the letters I have written
to you of late, on female education, are
confined
to the
subjec
t of
study
. I am
sensible
of the ridicule
sometimes
levelled at
those
who are called learned ladies. Either
these
ladies
must
be uncommonly pedantick, or
those
who ridicule them, uncommonly
ignorant
Do
not be
apprehensive
of acquiring
that title, or
sharing
the ridicule, but
remember
that the knowledge which I
wish
you to
acquire, is
necessary
to adorn your many
virtues
and amiable qualifications. This
ridicule
is evidently a
transatlantick
idea, and
must
have been imbibed from the
source
of
some
English
Novel or MagazineThe
American
ladies of this
class
, who come
within
our knowledge, we know to be
justly
celebrated
as ornaments to
society
, and an
honour to the
sex
. When it is
considered
how many of our countrywomen are capable
of the
task
, it is a matter of regret that
American
literature
boasts
so
few productions
from the pens of the ladies.
SELF complacency is a
most
necessary
acquirementfor the value of a woman will
always be
commensurate
to the opinion
she
entertains of
herself
. A celebrated
European
wit, in a letter to a lady, concenters much
good advice in one
short
rule of conduct:
REVERENCE THYSELF.
I WAS this morning reading
Swift
's letter
to a very young lady, on her marriage.
Although
this famous writer is not celebrated
for delicacy or
respec
t towards us, yet I
wish
some
of his
observations
contained
less
truthIf you are in company,
says
this
writer, when the
conversation
turns on the
manners and
customs
of remote nations, or
on books in
verse
or
prose
, or on the nature
and limits of virtue and vice, it is a
shame
for a lady not to
relish
such
discourses
, not to
improve by them, and endeavour by reading
and information, to have her
share
in
those
entertainments, rather than turn
aside
, as is
the
usual
custom
, and
consult
with the
woman
O
who
sits
next her, about a new cargo of
fans.
HE then
descends
to particulars, and
insists
on the
necessity
of orthography. Is it not a
little hard, continues he, that not one
gentleman's
daughter in a
thousand
should
be
brought to read or
understand
her own natural
tongue, or be judge of the
easiest
books that
are written in it; as any one may find, who
can have the patience to hear them mangle a
Play or a Novel?
IF there be any of your acquaintance
to whom this
passage
is applicable, I hope
you will recommend the
study
of Mr.
Webster
's
Grammatical
Institute
, as the
best
work
in our language to facilitate the knowledge
of Grammar. I cannot but think Mr.
Web
ster
intended his valuable book for the benefit
of his countrywomen: For while he delivers
his
rules
in a pure,
precise
, and elegant
style
,
he
explains
his meaning by
examples
which
are calculated to
inspire
the female mind
with a
thirst
for emulation, and a
desire
of
virtue.
NO
subjec
t has been more
exhausted
than
that of education. Many
Utopian
schemes
have been delineated, and much
speculation
employed. When I
peruse
these
labours,
and am
persuaded
the intention of their
authors
is to promote our welfare, I feel
myself
prompted to a prudent and amiable
demeanour
;
and I
suppose
every woman of
reason
and reflection feels the
same
inclination to
virtue, and the
same
sensations
of gratitude,
in reading the works of
those
writers, the
charac
teristicks
of whom, are
sentiment
,
morality and benevolence.
WHAT books do you read, my dear? We
are now
finishing
Barlow's
Vision
of
Columbus
,
and
shall
begin upon
Dwight
's
Conquest
of
Canaan
in a few days. It is very agreeable
to read with one, who points out the beauties
of the author as we proceed. Such an one
is
Worthy
.Sometimes Mr.
Holmes
makes
one of our party, and his notes and references
to the ancient poets are very entertaining.
Worthy
is delighted with the
ease
and
freedom
with which we live here. We have
little concerts, we walk, we ride, we read, we
have good companythis is
Belleview
in all
its glory!
ADIEU
ADIEU, my dearI
shall
continue this
subjec
t no longer, though I flatter
myself
you
would receive my hints with
satisfac
tion,
because
you
must
be
persuaded
I love you, and
so
interest
myself
in your welfareI need
not add that I think your conduct worthy of
you. You are
such
a good girl that I know
not in what to direct you; for you leave
me no room for advicecontinue to
anticipate
the
desires
of my heart, and to
secure
the high opinion you have there obtained.
Your friend forever!

LETTER XXXI.
Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
If
the affair of your brother and
Harriot
be
serious
, and matrimony is really
on the tapis, do not fail to make me
previously
acquainted with itI very much
doubt the evidence of the
verses
they
weigh
in my mindand he is
easily
excused
for
sending
them to
so
fine a girl as
Harriot
.
YOUR
observations
on her dependence on
Mrs.
Francis
do honour to your heart
virtue
does not
consist
in affluence and
independence
nor
can it be reflected on us by
the glory of our connexions
those
who
pride
themselves
on it, make but an
indifferent
figure; for in the
estimation
of all
sensible
peopletrue merit is
personal
.
HOWEVER, my dear friend, as one who
wishes
for your welfare and the
happiness
of
your family, I
advise
you to
discourage
the
proposed
connexionand if you cannot
undertake this
disagreeable
task
with a
certainty
of
success
, do not fail to acquaint me of
it
speedily
.
Adieu!
LETTER XXXII.
HARRINGTON to WORTHY.
BOSTON.
What
ails my heart? I feel
a void hereand yet I verge towards my
happiness
for a few days makes
Harriot
mine
Myra
says
I had
better not marry her
.
What could prompt her to
use
such
an
expression
?
Better not marry her
. She has
repeated
it
several
timesand with too much
eagerness
I give no heed to itand yet
why
should
it affect me in this manner?
Is it an artifice to fathom the depth of my
love? Such
schemes
are my utter
aversion
it
disturbs
meI hate
such
artificeYou
cannot imagine how it touches my heart.
Adieu!
LETTER XXXIII.
Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
It
is the duty of friends to be
interested
in all the concerns of one another
to join in their joys and to avert the
stroke
of danger. It is the duty of a centinel to
give the alarm at the approach of what he
may think
such
and if the
result
does not
prove to be a real evilhe has but
performed
his duty, and the action is meritorious.
IF your exertions to countermine the
connexion
of your brother with
Harriot
should
prove ineffectual (and do not fail to acquaint
me with it either way)
I have a tale to
unfold
which may
possibly
forbid the
bans.
LETTER XXXIV.
HARRINGTON to WORTHY.
BOSTON.
I find
my temper grow
extremely
irritablemy
sensibility
is wounded at
the
slightest
neglectI am very tenacious of
every thing, and of every body.
A PARTY was made
yesterday
to go on
the water; I was omitted, and the neglect
hurt me. I inquired the
cause
, and what
think you is the
answer
? I am no com
panyI am
asked
a
question
and return
nothing to the pointI am
absent
---I am
strangely
altered within a few days---I am
thinking of a different
subje
ct when I
ought to be employed in
conversation
---I
am extravagant in my
observations
---I
am no company.
THEY would
persuade
me that I am little
better than a mad man---I have no patience
with their
nonsensical
replies---Such
nonenical">nonsensical
replies---Such
wifeacres
do not
deserve
my pity.
Farewel!
LETTER XXXV.
MYRA to Mrs. HOLMES.
BOSTON.
Your
letter is filled with
such
ambiguous
expressions
, that I am utterly at
a
loss
to
discover
your meaning.
I HAVE, however,
sounded
him on the
article of marriage, and the
result
is---he
loves
Harriot
most
passionately
---and on
account
of my father's
aversion
to early
marriages
,
will marry her privately in a few
days.
THE oftener I read your letter, the more
I am perplexed and
astonished
: YOU HAVE
A TALE TO UNFOLD---For Heaven's
sake
shen
unfold it, before it be too late---and as
you dread the
consequence
of keeping it
secret
,
by
disclosing
it to me, you will prevent
the
mischief
, you
so
much deprecateI
am all impatience.
Adieu!
LETTER XXXVI.
HARRINGTON to WORTHY.
BOSTON.
I have
just
left
Harriot
---but
how have I left her? In tears. I
wish
I
had not gone. Mrs.
Francis
had
intrusted
Harriot
with
some
trisling
commission
---It
was not done---
she
had not had time to
perform it.
Harriot
was reprimanded
Yes! by Heaven---this Mrs.
Francis
had
the
insolence
to reprimand
Harriot
in my
presence
---I was mortified---I walked to
the window---my heart was on fire---my
blood boiled in my veins---it is
impossible
to form an idea of the
disorder
of my nerves
Harriot
's were equally agitatedMrs.
Francis
saw
our
consusion
and retired
she
left
P
me
so
completely out of temper that I was
forced to follow her example. I
kissed
away
the tear from the cheek of
Harriot
and
withdrew
to my chamber.
HERE let me forget what has
passed
my
irritability will not permit itmy feelings
are too
easily
set
in motion to enjoy long
quietness
my nerves are delicately
strung
;
they are now out of tune, and it is a hard
matter to harmonize them.
I FEEL that I have a foul
and every man
of
sensibility
feels it within
himself
. I will
relate a
circumstance
I met with in my late
travels through
Southcarolina
I was always
susceptible
of
touches of nature
.
I HAD often remarked a female
slave
pass
by my window to a
spring
to fetch water.
She had
something
in her air
superiour
to
thoe of her
situation
a fire that the damps
of
slavery
had not
extinguished
.
AS I was one day walking behind her,
the wind blew her tattered handkerchief from
her neck and
exposed
it to my
sight
I
asked
her the
cause
of the
scar
on her
shoulder
She
answered
composedly
, and with an
earnestness
that proved
she
-was not
ashamed
to declare itIt is the mark of the whip,
said
,
she
, and went on with the
history
of it,
without my
desiring
her to proceed---my
boy, of about ten years old, was unlucky
enough to break a
glass
tumbler---this crime
was immediately inquired into---I trembled
for the fate of my child, and was thought to
be guilty. I did not deny the charge, and
was tied up. My former good character
availed nothing. Under every affliction, we
may receive
consolation
; and during the
smart
of the whip, I rejoiced
because
I
shielded
with my body the
lash
from my
child; and I rendered thanks to the
best
of
beings that I was allowed to
suffer
for him.
HEROICALLY
spoken
!
said
I, may
he whom you call the
best
of beings
continue
you in the
same
sentiments
may thy foul
be ever
disposed
to SYMPATHIZE with thy
children, and with thy brethren and
sisters
in
calamity---then
shalt
thou feel every
circumstance
of thy life afford thee
satisfa
ction;
and repining and melancholy
shall
fly from
thy
bosom
---all thy labours will become
easy
---all thy burdens light, and the yoke
of
slavery
will never gall thy neck.
I WAS
sensible
relieved as I pronounced
these
words, and I felt my heart glow with
feelings of
exquisite
delight, as I anticipated
the happy time when the
sighs
of the
slave
shall
no longer expire in the air of freedom.
What delightful
sensations
are
those
in
which the heart is
interested
! In which it
stoops
to enter into the little concerns of
the
most
remote ramification of Nature!
Let the vain, the giddy, and the proud
pass
on without deigning to notice themlet
them cheat
themselves
of
happiness
these
are
circumstances
which are important only
to a
sentimental
traveller.
HALL

Sweetener of the joys of
life! Heaven has implanted thee in the
breasts
of his childrento

of the afflictedto mitigate the wounds of

Away, ye
seekers
of powerye
boasters
of wealthye are the
Levite
and the
Pharisee

the hand of charity from the
indigent, and turn with indignation from the

MYRA to Mrs. HOLMES.

Accept
my
warmest
acknowledgment
,
my good friend, for your
kindness
Your letter
sufficiently
explains your
former anxietyit has removed all
ambiguities
.
YOUR
servant
entered
hastily
with the
letter
and
gave it me with evident tokens of
its containing a matter of importance.My
father was
present
I broke it open, not
without agitationI read itbut the
shock
was too
severe
it fell from my hands, and I
sunk
into the chair.
MY sainting was not of any duration. I
opened my eyes and found my father
supporting
mebut the idea of
Harriot
was
still
engraven deeply in my heartI
inquired
for my
sister
the tear rolled down his
cheekit was a
sufficient
answer
to my
inquiry
He
said
nothingthere was no
necessity
of his
saying
a word.
COULD I
ask
him to explain your letter?
Nomy heart anticipated his feelings
the impropriety
struck
me at once.
You
have a tale to unfold
. Do not delay to
unfold
it.
Adieu!
LETTER XXXIX.
Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
I readily
undertake to give
you a
sketch
of the
history
of
Harriot
. Her
mother's name was
Maria Fawcet
; her
person
I yet recollect, and forgive me if I drop
a tear of pity at the recital of her
misfortunes
.
MY mother and Mrs.
Holmes
were
remarkable
friends, and the intimacy, you
know, was maintained between the two
families
.
I was on a
visit
with my mother
when the
destiny
of
Maria
led her to
Belleview
.
I was frequently there during her
illness
and was with her in her
lasst
moments
.
IT was the
custom
of Mrs.
Holmes
to
walk in the garden towards the
close
of the
day. She was once indulging her
usual
walk, when
she
was alarmed by the
complaints
of a woman which came from the
road. Pity and humanity were ever peculiar
chara
cteristicks
of my amiable parent---She
hastened
to the place from whence the
sound
issued
and beheld a young woman, bathed
in tears,
sitting
upon the ground. She
inquired
the
cause
of her
distress
, with that
eager
solicitude
to relieve, which a
sight
so
uncommon would naturally
occasion
. It was
sometime
before the
distressed
woman could
return an intelligible
answer
, and then
she
with difficulty proceeded: Your
goodness
,
Madam, is unmerited---you behold a
stranger
,
without home---without friends---and
whose
misery
bears her down to an
untimely
grave---Life, truly is a
blessing
---but my
life is become
burthensome
, and were the
Almighty this moment to command me to
the world of
spirits
, methinks I could gladly
obey the
summons
, and rejoice in the
stroke
which bade me depart from
sorrow
and
the world. Moderate your grief, my
dear woman, repine not at the will of
Providence
,
nor
suffer
yourself
to
despair
,
however
severe
your misfortunes.
THE unfortunate woman was at length
prevailed on to accompany Mrs.
Holmes
into
the
house
,
she
partook of
some
refreshment
and retired to
sleep
. In a few days
she
appeared to be better; but it was a
temporary
recovery;
she
then told her
story
, with
frequent interruptions, in
substance
as
follows
:
History of Maria
.
I DATE the
rise
of my misfortunes,
said
Maria
, at the beginning of my
acquaintance
with the Honourable Mr.
Harrington
.
But
for his
solicitations
I might
Q
still
have lived in peacea
sister
would not
have had
occasion
to
blush
at the
sound
of
my namenor had a mother's pillow been
steeped
in tears, too
sondly
prone to
remember
a
graceless
but repenting child---We
lived happily together in the days of my
father
,
but when it
pleased
Providence to
remove
him, we no longer
asserted
our
pretentions
to that rank of life which our
straitened
finances were unable to continue
A young woman in no eligible
circumstances
,
has much to apprehend from the
solicitations
of a man of affluence. I am now
better
persuaded
of this truth, than I ever
was beforefor this was my unhappy
situation---I
always entertained a predilection
for Mr.
Harrington
he urged his
passion
with
protestations
of
sincerity
and affection
---he found my heart too
slightly
guarded
---he
strove
he triumphed.
MUST I proceed!
A SMILING female was the offspring of
our illicit connexionAh! my little
Harriot
!
continued
Maria
, as
she
wiped away
a tear from her eye,
mayest
thou enjoy that
happiness
which is denied to thy mother.
OUR amour was not fated to
last
long
I
discovered
his gay temper to be
materially
alteredhe was oftentimes thoughtful and
melancholy, and his
visits
became
suddenly
shorter
, and
less
frequent.
I AFTERWARDS thought this change
of conduct owing to
jealousy
for he once
asked
me if a gentleman had called upon me
I
persisted
in avowing my abhorrence of
his ungenerous
suspicion
---He left me
abruptly
,
and I
saw
nothing of him after.
A STROKE
so
unexpected fell heavy on
my heartit awakened me to the
state
of
misery
into which my imprudence had
hurried
me.---What
recompense
could I
expect
from my Seducer?---He had been
married two years---From the inflexibility
of his temper I had little to hope, and I
formed a determination of leaving town, for
I had now indubitable
testimony
of his
affection
being
estranged
from mehalf
frantick
,
I immediately
set
out---but whither I
knew not---I walked with precipitation
until
Providence directed me to your
hospitable
door: To your
goodness
, Madam, I am
indebted
for prolonging my
existence
a
few
days
: For
amidst
the
kindness
and civilities
of
those
around me, I feel
myself
rapidly
verging towards the grave. I prepare
myself
for my approaching fate---and daily
wait the
stroke
of death with trembling
expectation.
SHE wrote to Mr.
Harrington
about a
week before her
decease
---I
transcribe
the
Letter:
The Hon. Mr.
Harrington
.
TO the man for whom my bleeding
heart yet retains its wonted affection, though
the author of my guilt and
misery
, do I
address
my feeble complaint---O!
Harrington
,
I am verging to a long eternity---and
Q 2
it is with difficulty I
support
myself
while
my trembling hand traces the dictates of
my heart.
Indisposed
as I am---and
unable
as I feel to
prosecute
this
task
---I
however
collect all my powers to bid you a long
---a final
farewell
.
OH!
Harrington
, I am about to depart
---for why
should
. I tarry here? In bitter
tears of
sorrow
do I weep away the night,
and the returning day but augments the
anguish
of my heart, by recalling to view
the
sad
sight
of my misfortunes. And
have I not
cause
for this
severe
anguish
, at
once the
sorrow
and
disgrace
of my family?
Alas! my poor mother!Death
shall
expiate
the crime of thy daughter, nor longer
raise
the
blush
of indignation on thy
glowing
cheek.Ought I not therefore, to
welcome
the hand of death?
BUT what will become of my poor
helpless
infant, when its mother lies forgotten
in the grave? Wilt thou direct its feet in
the path of virtue and rectitude?Wilt
thou
shelter
it from the ride
blasts
of
penury
and want?Open your heart to
the
solicitude
of a motherof a mother
agonizing
for the future welfare of her child.
Let me intreat you to perform this
request
by the love which you
professed
for thy
Maria
by her life which you have
sacrificed
.
AND wilt thou not drop a tear of pity
in the grave of thy
Maria?
I know thy
soul
is a
soul
of
sensibility
; but my
departure
shall
not grieve theeno, my
Harrington
,
it
shall
not
wrest
a
sigh
from thy
bosom
rather let me live, and defy the malice and
misery
of the worldBut can
tenderness
can love atone for the
sacrifices
I have
made?Will it blot out my errours from the
book of memory? Will love be an
excuse
for my crime, or hide me from the eye of
the malignantNo, my
Harrington
, it will
not. The
passion
is unwarrantable. Be
it thine, gentle
Amelia
be it thine to
check the obtruding
sigh
, and wipe away the
tear from his facefor thou art his wife, and
thy
soul
is the
seat
of
compassion
Butfor
me
Farewelfarewel forever!
Maria
.
SHE
survived
but a
short
timeand
frequently
expressed
a concern for her child
but Mrs.
Holmes
quieted her fears by
promising
to protect it. She accordingly made
inquiry after itand it is the
same
Harriet
who was educated by her order, and whom
she
afterwards placed in the family of Mrs.
Francis
.
THE
assurances
of my mother were like
balm to the broken hearted
Maria
I
shall
now,
said
she
, die in peace.
THE following is a copy of a letter written
by the Rev. Mr.
Holmes
to the Hon.
Mr.
Harrington
:
BELLEVIEW.
SIR,
WE have a
scene
of
distress
at our
house
peculiarly pathetick and affecting, and of
which you, perhaps, are the
sole
authorYou
have had a criminal connexion with
Miss
Fawcet
you have turned her upon the world
inhumanlybut chancerather let me
say
Providence, hath directed her
footsteps
to my
dwelling, where
she
is kindly entertained,
and will be
so
, as long as
she
remains in this
wilderness
world, which is to be, I fear, but
a
short
time---And
shall
she
not, though
she
hath been decoyed from the road that
leadeth
to peace, long life and
happiness
---
shall
she
not, if
she
return with tears of
repentance
and contrition, be entitled to our
love and charity? Yes---this is my doctrine
---If I behold any child of human nature
distressed
and forlorn, and in real want of the
necessities
of life,
must
I
restrain
or withhold
the hand of charity---
must
I
cease
to recal
the departing
spirit
of them that are ready to
perish
, until I make diligent inquiry into
their
circumstances
and character? Surely,
my friend, it is a duty incumbent on us by
the ties of humanity and fellow feeling, and
by the duty
imposed
on us by our holy
religion
,
equally to extend the hand of relief
to
all the
necessitous
however they may be
circumstanced
in the great family of
mankind
.
THE crime of
Maria
is not the
blackest
in the annals of human turpitude; but
however
guilty
she
might have been, the tears of
penitence do certainly make atonement
therefor.
THUS much have I thought proper to
say
in vindication of my conduct---in
sheltering
under my roof a poor wandererwho
hath
strayed
, but not wantonly, and who
hath now happily returned.
ONE would imagine, there was little
necessity
of making
such
a vindication to you;
but my
sentiments
always flow from the
abundance of my heart, and I am willing the
whole world
should
judge of
those
which
influence my conductNow, though
some
men,
whose
charity is contracted, and
who may be denominated
prudes in virtue
,
might deem wrongfully of my attention to
the calamity of this frail womanyet let
me appeal to the hearts and
understandings
of all men, and
these
in particular, if I have
erred, whether it be not an errour on the
side
of humanity. Would to God
such
amiable errours were more frequent!In
as much, my friend, as there is joy in heaven
over one
sinner
that repenteth, I may
say
with
assurance
that I have felt an emanation
of this heavenly joy animate my heart, in
beholding this woman delighting to
steer
her
course
heavenward.
FROM the unhappy condition of
Maria
,
I have been led to reflect on the
mischievous
tendency of SEDUCTION. Methinks I
view the
distressing
picture in all its horrid
colours.
R
BEHOLD the youthful virgin arrayed
in all the delightful charms of vivacity,
modesty
and
sprightliness
Behold even while
she
is
rising
in beauty and dignity, like a lily
of the valley, in the full
blossom
of her
graces,
she
is cut off
suddenly
by the rude
hand of the Seducer. Unacquainted with
his
beseness
and treachery, and too ready to
repose
confidence in him
she
is deluded
by the
promises
and flattery of the man who
professes
the
greatest
love and
tenderness
for
her welfare:But did
she
understand
the
secret
villainy of his intentionswould
she
appear thus elate and joyous? Would
she
assent
to her ruin? Would
she
subscribe
her name to the catalogue of infamy? Would
she
kiss
the hand of the atrocious
dastard
,
already
raised
to give the final wound to her
reputation and peace?
O! WHY is there not an adequate
punishment
for this crime, when that of a
common
traitor is marked with its
deserved
iniquity
and abhorrence!
IS it
necessary
to depicture the
slate
of
this deluded young creature after her fall
from virtue? Stung with
remorse
, and
frantick
with
despair
, does
she
not fly from the
face of day, and
secrete
her
conscious
head in
the
bosom
of eternal
forgetfulness
?
Melancholy
and guilt transfix her heart, and
she
sighs
out her
miserable
existence
the prey
of poverty, ignominy and reproach!
Lost
to the world, to her friends, and to
herself
,
she
blesses
the approach of death in whatever
shape
he may appear, that terminates a life,
no longer a
blessing
to its
possessour
, or a joy
to
those
around her.
BEHOLD her
stretched
upon the
mournful
bier!Behold her
silently
descend
to the
grave!Soon the wild weeds
spring
afresh
round the
little hillock
, as if to
shelter
the
remains
of betrayed innocenceand the
friends of her youth
shun
even the
spot
which
conceals her relicks.
SUCH is the
consequence
of SEDUCTION,
but it is not the only
consequence
. Peace
and
happiness
fly the nuptial couch which is
unattended by love and fidelity. The mind
no longer enjoys its quiet, while it
ceases
to
cherish
sentiments
of truth and gratitude.
The
sacred
ties
of connubial duty are not to
be violated with impunity; for though a
violation of
those
ties
may be overlooked by
the eye of
justice
, the heart
shall
supply
a
monitor
, who will not fail to correct
those
,
who are hardy enough to
burst
them
asunder
.I
am, &c.
W.
Holmes

TO this Letter, Mr.
Harrington
returned
the following
Answer
.
Hon. Mr. Harrington to the Rev. Mr.
Holmes.
PERMIT me, my ever honoured
friend, to return you thanks for your late
favours
need
I addan acknowledgment
for your liberality? Noyour heart
supplies
a
source
of
pleasure
which is
constantly
nourished
by your
goodness
and
universal
charity.
THE picture you have exhibited of a
ruined
female is undoubtedly
just
, but that the
R 2
rude
spoiler
has his
share
of
remorse
is
equally
so
The
conclusion
of your letter is a real
picture of the
situation
of my heart.
PERHAPS you was always ignorant of
the real motives that influenced me, and
gave a particular bias to my conductAt
an early period of my life, I adopted a
maxim
,
that
the
most
necessary
learning was a
knowledge
of the world
, the
pursuit
of which,
quadrating
with a volatility of
disposition
,
presented
a variety of
scenes
to my heated
imagination
.
The
eclat
of my companions
gratifying my vanity and
increasing
the gale
of
passion
, I became
insensibly
hurried down
the
stream
of
dissipation
. Here I
saw
mankind
in every point of viewfrom the
acme of the
most
consummate
refinement,
to the
most
adject
stage
of degradation. I
soon
became a ready proficient in the great
school
of the worldbut an alteration of
conduct was
soon
after
necessary
I was
compelled to it, not
so
much from the
world's abhorrence of a
dissolute
course
of
life, as the dictates of my own heartIt
was, indeed, my policy to flatter the world,
and exhibit a fair
outside
for I was in love
with
Amelia
My licentious amour with
Maria
was
secret
she
was affectionate and
tenderher manners were
pleasing
, but
still
I was unhappy.
MY career of
dissipation
, however
alluring
it
struck
my vitiated fancy, left little
satisfaction
on the mindReflection had its
turnand the
happiness
I had
promised
myself
in a connexion with the amiable
Amelia
,
I fully enjoyed in our marriage. A
course
of uninterrupted tranquillity
ensued
, but it
was of
short
duration. The volatility of
my temper, and the folicitude of my old
associates
,
induced me at
subsequent
periods
to fall again into my old vagaries. The
taverns frequently found me engaged in
meannesses
derogatory to the character of
a gentleman.
These
things I perceived
affected
the foul of
Amelia
she
was all
meekness
,
gentleness
and
compassion
, and
she
never once upbraided me with my illiberal
conduct:
But let concealment, like a worm in the bud,
Feed on her
damask
cheek.
BLESSED he that power who has
implanted
within us that
consciousness
of
reproach
,
which
springs
from
gentleness
and
love!Hail
sensibility
! Ye eloquent
tears
of
beauty!
that add dignity to human nature
by correcting its foiblesit was
these
that
corrected my faults when recrimination
would have failed of
success
it was
these
that opened every avenue of contrition in
my heart, when
words
would have dammed
up every fluice of repentance.
IT was now I appeared fully
sensible
that my conduct had hitherto been a
course
of
disorder
, and that
systems
of
reformation
,
however well planned, had
been overturned by the breath of
adulation
,
before they had been thoroughly
carried into executionthat I had been
drifting upon a
sea
of
inconsistency
, without
exercising
my judgment; like a
ship
without
a rudder, buffetted on the
bosom
of the
ocean
,
the
sport
of winds and waves.
THE criminality of my connexion with
Maria
appeared with the
most
aggravated
circumstances
; it
stung
me with
remorse
and I
instantly
determined, however fevere
the conflict, to tear her from my
bosom
to
see
her no more.But how was I to inform
her of it?In what manner was I to bring
about
such
a
task
?
Maria
must
be
sacrificed
to the
happiness
of
Amelia
. This was
all I had to performit was a
short
lesson
,
but it was a hard one for me to execute.
WITH this determination, however, I
entered the apartment of
Maria
Duty to
Amelia
and gratitude to
Maria
interchangeably
agitated methe contention was
dubious
but
duty prevailed, and I adhered to my
former
resolution
yet how was I to tell her
this would be the
last
visit
?
Conscious
she
had ever acted in conformity to my
wishes
how could I
accuse
her, without
accusing
myself
?I threw out a few
inconsiderate
,
and ungrateful hints of
jealousy
, and left the
room abruptly. The feelings of
Maria
must
have been injuredbut however her
sensibility
was affected, mine was doubly
so
;
I felt for herI felt for our infant, and
these
feelings were added to the afflictions
which had already
burst
upon my devoted
head. A few days
consideration
, however,
convinced me of the impropriety and
ingratitude
of my behaviour to
Maria
I
hastened
to tell her of itto place her in a
situation
that
should
screen
her from penury and
malice
and
to make
provision
for the child
but,
she
was not to be found. I was
informed
that
she
had
suddenly
disappeared
, and
that a countryman had, by her order, called
and taken away the child but a few hours
before. This information
burst
upon my
head like the voice of
sudden
thunderI
stood
motionless
, but my agitation was too
violent to be of any long duration.
A natural tear I
shed
, but wip'd it
soon
.
IT was your
goodness
, and the
humanity
of your family, that
sheltered
the wretched
Maria
, and provided for the
helpless
Harriot
Your feelings are your reward.
FROM all the variegated
scenes
of my
past
life, I daily learn
some
new
lesson
of
humanity
.
Experience hath been my tutor
I now take a
retrospe
ct of my
past
conduct
with deliberation, but not without
some
serious
reflection: Like a
sailor
escaped
from
shipwreck
, who
sits
safely
on the
shore
and
views the
horrors
of the
tempest
; but as
the gale
subsides
, and the waves hide their
heads in the
bosom
of the deep, he beholds
with greater concern the
mischief
of the
storm
and the dangers he hath
escaped
.
From what innate principle does this
arise
,
but from the
God within the mind!
I
assert
it for the honour of human nature, that no
man, however
dissolute
but comes back to
the hour of reflection and
solemn
thoughtfulness
S
when the actions that are
passed
return upon the mind, and this
internal
monitor
sits
in judgment upon them, and gives
her verdict of approbation or
dislike
.
HE who
listens
to its call, views his
character
in its proper lightI have attended to
its cry, and I
see
my deformityI recal my
mispent
time, but in vainI reflect on the
misery
of
Maria
, and I
curse
my temerity
I reflect on the
state
into which I have
plunged
a once happy female, and am eager to
apply a
speedy
remedy, but this is vain
also
:
Can I
restore
her that virtuethat innocence
that peace, of which I have unmanfully
robbed her?Let us leave the
melancholy
subje
ct.
I WILL not
so
far
supersede
the fruit of
your benevolence, as to
presume
to offer you
any other
recompense
, than my
sincere
prayers for your
happiness
.
I have the honour to be,
With
respe
ct,
Your &c.
J. Harrington
.
THE
disorder
of
Maria
was fatal and
rapidbut I
hasten
to the
last
scene
of her
lifeit has, though I was young, made an
impression
on my mind that time cannot
efface. I went to her, as
she
was
seated
on
the bedvirtue and harmony were blended
in her
aspe
ct
she
was
serene
and
composed
and her mien, while it
expressed
a
consciousness
of
superiour
worth and dignity,
exhibited
in one view, a
striking
picture of the
grandeur
of the human
soul
patient, though
afflictedof a
spirit
broken, and borne down
by
severe
distress
, yet
striving
to
surmount
all, and
aspire
to heaven. In what words
shall
I paint to you, my dear
Myra
, her
heroism
and
greatness
of mind? Weep not
for me,
said
she
, perceiving my emotion
Death has nothing
shocking
to meI have
familiarized
myself
to his terroursI feel
the gradual decay of mortality; and
waiting
with confidence in the father of mercy,
I am prepared to
resign
this mortal breath
I
resign
it in firm
assurance
of the
soul
's
blessed
immortalityDeath I view as freeing me
from a world which has
lost
its
relish
as
opening new
scenes
of
happiness
But a
few moments, continued
she
,
clasping
my
hand, and the
scene
of life is
closed
forever---Heaven
opens on my
soul
---I go
where all tears
shall
be wiped away---I
welcome
death as the angel of peace.She
uttered
these
words with a placid
smile
of
resignation
---her head
sunk
down on the
pillow---and the next minute
she
was an
angel.
SOUL of the

LETTER XL.
Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
Having
presented
you with
several
observations
on Seduction, I think it
will not be
mal apropos
to
consider
the
question
in another point of view, and
discover
how a woman may be
accessary
to her own
ruin---It is hardly worth while to contend
about the difference between the meaning
of the terms
accessary
and
principal
. The
difference, in fact, is
small
; but when a
woman
,
by her imprudence,
exposes
herself
,
she
is
accessary
; for though her heart may be
pure, her conduct is a tacit invitation to the
Seducer.
EDUCATED in the
school
of luxury and
pride, the female heart grows gradually
torpid
to the fine feelings of
sensibility
the
blush
of
modesty
wears offthe charms of
elegant
simplicity
fade by degreesand the
continual hurry of
dissipation
supersedes
the
improvement of
serious
reflection.
Reflection
is a kind of relaxation from frolicking
it encourages the
progress
of virtue, and
upholds
the heart from
sinking
to depravity.
WE may lay it down as a principle, that
that conduct which will bear the
test
of
reflection
,
and which creates a
pleasure
in the mind
from a
consciousness
of acting right, is
virtuous
:
And
she
whose
conduct will not bear this
test
, is
necessarily
degenerating, and
she
is
assenting
to her
destruction
LET a lady be liberal or even magnificent,
according to her
circumstances
or
situation
in life; but let the heart remain uncorrupt,
let her not be contaminated by wealth,
ambition
or
splendour
. She may then take a
happy
retrospe
ct of her conducther heart
cannot upbraid herand the
suffrage
of her
own mind is a convincing proof that
she
has not
strayed
from the path of virtue.
HAPPY they who can thus reflectwho can
recal to view the
scenes
that are
passed
, and
behold their actions with reiterated
satisfaction
they
become ambitious of excelling in
everything virtuous,
because
they are certain
of
securing
a continual reward: For as a
mighty river fertilizes the country through
which it
passes
and
encreases
in magnitude and
force until it empty
itself
into the ocean: So
virtue fertilizes or improves the heart, and
gathers
strength
and vigour by continual
progression
, until it centre in the
consummation
of its
desires
.
DAZZLED by the glitter of
splendour
, and
unmindful of the real charms of economy
and
simplicity
, the female heart
sighs
for the
enjoyment of
fashion
, and flutters to join the
motley train of
pleasure
. But how is it
deluded
by empty deceptions! Like the fruit
which
sprang
up in the infernal regions,
beautiful to the eye, but which left upon the
taste
bitter
ashes
, and was followed by
repentance
A
great quantity of this kind of
fruit
presents
itself
to my
rashly
judging
sex
;
and it frequently happens that their hearts
have as little inclination to
resist
the
temptation
,
as our general parent to
refuse
the
fatal apple.
WE do not
rouse
to our aid fortitude to
enable us to
surmount
the temptation, but
yield
ourselves
to a kind of voluntary
slavery
.
Hence it is
observable
, that a woman is often
unhappy in the
midst
of
pleasures
and
petulent
without
cause
that
she
is trifling in
matters of the
highest
importance; and the
most
momentous concern is
considered
futile
,
as whim and caprice may chance to
dictate.
THE
progress
of female luxury, however
flow it may appear,
unless
timely checked,
works with infallible and
destru
ctive
advances
.
The rule we at
first
adopted might
perhaps
answer
this check; for by the
examination
there recommended, we behold the
dangers of a continuation of
such
conduct
Ruin and contempt, the invariable
concommitants
of vice and immorality, proclaim
their denunciations on a
prosecution
of it.
LET us examine the gradual
steps
, and
the
consequence
of female luxury.A
desire
to be admired is the
first
. Behold a woman
surrounded
by her
worshippers
, receiving the
sacrifice
of adulationwhat was given her
at
first
as compliment,
she
now demands as
her due. She finds
herself
disappointed
, and
is mortified. The
first
desire
still
predominating
,
she
attaches
herself
to the votaries
of pride, who direct their feet in the paths of
extravagance and irreligion. Thus
sunk
into effeminacy and
meanness
,
she
forfeits her
virtue rather than her pride
. Thus
terminates
the career of a woman,
whose
mind is
debilitated, and
whose
life is expended in
the
pursuit
of vanity.
IT is
said
of
some
species
of
American
serpents
,
that they have the power of charming
birds and
small
animals, which they
destine
for their prey. The
serpent
is
stretched
underneath
a treeit looks
stedfastly
on the
birdtheir eyes meet to
separate
no more
the charm begins to operatethe
fascinated
bird flutters and hops from limb to limb,
till unable any longer to extend its wings,
it falls into the voracious jaws of its enemy:
This is no ill emblem of the
fascinating
power
of
pleasure
. Surrounded with
temptation
,
and
embarrassed
in her
circumstances
,
a woman of
dissipation
becomes
less
tenacious
of her honourand falls an
easy
prey
to the
fascinating
power of the
SEDUCER
.
HAVING traced to you, my dear
Myra
,
the
rise
, advancement and termination of
pleasure
and pride in the female heart, it
appears
almost
unnecessary
to remark that this
conduct cannot bear the
test
of reflection and
serious
examination. We may, however,
observe
on the contrary, that a woman who
advances a few
steps
, often hurries on
still
further to prevent thought. This bars the
way to a return to that conduct which
can
give
pleasure
on recollection. She behaves
to
herself
as the populace did formerly to
women
suspe
cted of witchcraftthey were
T
tied neck and heels and thrown into the
river; if they
swam
they were hung for
witchesif they
sank
they were acquitted of
the crime, but drowned in the experiment:
So when we only
suspect
our hearts of an
errour, we plunge
still
deeper into the
sea
of
dissipation
, to prevent the trial of that
conduct
which impartial
reason
and judgment
would approve.
notwithstanding
I give this
instance
as an encouragement for virtue; yet in all
those
I have mentioned is a woman
accessary
to her ruin.
DO not imagine, my dear
Myra
, that I mean
to argue
against
all
pleasure
Many of us
set
out on a principle of
false
delicacy and
destructive
rivalship
; we cannot behold a
fine woman without
wishing
to appear finer.
A laudable emulation in the conduct of all
women is extremely
praiseworthy
it
stimulates
them in the line of their duty
increases
vivacity and good humour; and ambition,
thus directed and
pursued
, I beg leave to
designate
a female virtue,
because
it is
productive
of the
most
happy
consequences
.
BUT it
sometimes
happens that particular
virtues
loose
themselves
in their
neighbouring
vices, and this laudable emulation
degenerates
into
destru
ctive
rivalship
.
A GENTEEL,
handsome
woman,
deservedly
shares
the
esteem
and admiration of all
men; but why
should
this
esteem
and
admiration
,
justly
paid to merit, give us
disquiet
?
the
answer
is ready. That
desire
to
be admired,
so
predominant in all females,
by degrees works
itself
into the ruling
passion
,
and precludes from the mind the
particular
virtue of emulation; for why a woman
who merits the love of the world,
should
draw on her the
disapprobation
of many of
her own
sex
, can be accounted for, by no
other principle, than the mean, pitiful
passion
of envy.
THIS may
possibly
give
rise
to defamation.
It is
astonishing
how this practice prevails
among a
few
persons
because
it is known
by experience, to prove
subversive
of its very
intention.The arrows of envy recoil upon
herself
.
HOW
foolish
must
that woman appear who
depreciates the merit of another, that
she
may appear unrivalled! She
raises
up the
dykes of ill nature, and inundates the land
with a flood of
scandal
, but unhappily
drowns
herself
in the event.
I LEAVE it to the
result
of your
observation
,
my dear
Myra
, whether the woman
who is
first
to develope her
stores
of
defamation
,
and through
false
emulation, the
first
to traduce a woman of real merit and
virtue
,
is not
also
the
first
who becomes a
scandal
to
herself
, and
consequently
the
first
that
is contemned.
HOW
opposite
are the
pursuits
and rewards
of her who participates in every rational
enjoyment
of life, without mixing in
those
scenes
of
indiscretion
which give pain on
recollection!
Whose
chymical genius leads
T 2
her to extract the
poison
from the
most
luxuriant
flowers, and to draw honey even from
the weeds of
society
. She mixes with the
world
seemingly
indiscriminately
and
because
she
would
secure
to
herself
that
satisfaction
which
arises
from a
consciousness
of
acting right,
she
views her conduct with an
eye of
scrutiny
. Though her temper is free
and
unrestrained
, her heart is
previously
secured
by the precepts of prudencefor
prudence
is but another name for virtue. Her
manners are unruffled, and her
disposition
calm, temperate and
dispassionate
, however
she
may be
surrounded
by the temptations
of the world.

LETTER XLV.
MYRA to Mrs. HOLMES.

In
what words
shall
I
describe
to
you, my dear friend, the
misery
that has
suddenly
overwhelmed us! It is
impossible
to
communicate the
distressed
situation
of
Har
U
riot
---
Expression
is inadequate to give you
an idea of our meeting---I called her my
friend---my
sister
---She always loved me---
but joy and affection gave way to
passion
---
Her
speech
refused
its office---
Sorrow in all its pomp was there,
Mute and magnificent without a tear.
SHE had gained a
sister
---
she
had
lost
a
lover---a
burst
of joy would
suddenly
break
from her, but it was of
short
duration---and
was
succeeded
by pangs of
exquisite
distress
---nature was unable to
support
it, and
she
sainted
under the weight of the
severe
conflict.
Her
constitution
at
best
is
seeble
; her
present
illness
is therefore attended with
more danger---
Unless
a
speedy
alteration
should
take place, the
physician
has little
hopes of her recovery.Heaven
preserve
us!

I might have known ithow

Here was all the horrour of

sudden
floods of tearsThe
scene
was too
much for my heart to bearI bade her

myself
from her and retired.
WHAT is human
happiness
? The prize
for which all
strive
, and
so
few obtain; the
more eagerly we
pursue
it, the farther we
stray
from the object: Wherefore I have
determined within
myself
that we
increase
in
misery
as we
increase
in ageand if there
are any happy they are
those
of
thoughtless
childhood.
I THEN viewed the world at a
distance
in
perspe
ctive. I thought mankind appeared
happy in the
midst
of
pleasures
that flowed
round them. I now find it a deception,
and am tempted
sometimes
to
wish
myself
a
child again. Happy are the dreams of
infancy
,
and happy their
harmless
pursuits
! I
saw
the
ignis
satuus
, and have been running
after it, but now I return from the
search
. I
return and bring back
disappointment
. As
I reflect on
these
scenes
of infantine
ignorance

I feel my heart
interested

sensibly
affectedand however
sutile

LETTER XLIX.
The Hon. Mr. HARRINGTON to the Rev.
Mr. HOLMES.
BOSTON.
Accumulated
sorrows
continue to break over my devoted head.
Harriot
is at times deprived of her
reason
,
and we have no expectation of her
recovery
my
son
is deeply affectedhe
seems
strangely
disordered
.
REVOLVING in my mind all thefe things,
and the unhappy affair that led to them,
the whole train of my
past
life returned
fresh
upon my mind. Pained with the
disagreeable
picture, and
oppressed
with the weight
of my afflition, I funk down to fleep:
These
circumstances
had
so
strongly
impressed
my imagination that they produced the
following DreamMy blood is chilled with
horrour as I write.
METHOUGHT I
suddenly
found
myself
in
a large, open field,
waste
and uncultivated
here I wandered in a
solitary
manner for
some
time
gries
seized
my heart at the
awful
appearance of the place, and I cried
aloud
How
long
shall
I travel here, alone
and
friendless
a
dusky
mist
swims
before
my fight, and the
obscure
horizon
seems
only
to
inclose
this
dismal
wild! Having
advanced
a few
steps
, I thought a light at a
distance
appeared to my doubtful view. Faint
with fatigue, I approached it, and had the
satisfa
ction to behold a
person
of the
most
benign
aspe
cta quiet ferenity was painted
on his brow, and
happiness
ineffable
beamed
from his divine countenanceJoy
leaped
in my
bosom
, and in the
ecstacy
of
passion
I endeavoured to
clasp
the
blessed
spirit
to my heart; but it
vanished
in my
embrace
.
TEACH me,
blessed
shade
,
said
I, with
a trembling voice teach me to find the
habitations of menWhat do I here?
Why am I doomed to explore the barren
bosom
of this baleful
desert
?
This
,
returned
the
spirit
, in a voice, which, while it
commanded veneration and love,
struck
awe and terrour into my
soul
this
is not
the habitation of the
sons
of mortalityit is
the place appointed to receive the
souls
of all
men, after they have
resigned
the bodies they
animated on earth.
Those
who have
violated
the laws of
reason
, humanity, religion,
and have
dishonoured
their God, here meet
the
punishment
due to their crimes.
ATTEND me, therefore, and view the
condition of
those
thoughtless
souls
, who, a
few days ago, were upon earth immerfed in
pleasure
, luxury and vice
Regardless
of
futurity
,
and unprepared for their eternal
summons
to another worldand who
persisted
in the delight of their own eyes in
opposition
to the divine law, and deaf to the voice of
reclaiming virtue.
These
, the
sons
of folly
and riot, are
smitten
by the angel of death,
while they are yet drinking of the bowl of
vicewhile the words of
blasphemy
yet
well upon their tongues. And when
their unhappy
spirits
sink
to
these
infernal
regions, their
surviving
companions
rehearse
their funeral panegyricksthe
praise
of one is, that he could drink the longeft
the merit of another, that he could
sing
a
good
song
a third
secures
his
same
by
being
excellent in mimickry and
bussoonery
How unhappy
must
he be, who leaves no
other
testimony
of his
usefulness
behind
him!
HOW different is the fate of the good
man: While upon earth his life is
employed
in the
cause
of virtueThe
happiness
he
bestows
on
those
around him is reflected back
with tenfold reward; and when he takes
rank in that happy place, where there is
fulness
of joy, and leaves the world of
mankind
,
what numbers are joined in the
general
concern for his
loss
The aged, while
they prepare for the fame journey, delight to
dwell on his good actionsthe virgin
strews
flowers on his grave, and the poet
consumes
the midnight oil to celebrate his virtues.
THERE was
so
much benignity in every
word and action of my attendant, that I
found
myself
imperceptibly attached to him.
My attention to his
discourse
had prevented
me from
observing
the
progress
we had made
for we had arrived at a place encircled
with high wallsa great gate, at the
command
of my guide,
instantly
flew open
Follow me,
said
heI tremblingly
obeyed
.
W
MY ears were
instantaneously
filled with
the faint cries of
those
here doomed to
receive
the rewards of their demerits.
Looking
earnestly
forward, I beheld a group of
unhappy wretchesI
observed
a
person
who
was continually tormenting themhe held
in one hand a whip, the
lashes
of which
were
composed
of adders, and the
stings
of
scorpions
; and in the other a large mirrour,
which, when he held up to the faces of the
tormented, exhibited their crimes in the
most
flagrant colours, and forced them to
acknowledge
the
justness
of their
punishment
.
These
,
said
my guide, who are
scourged
with a whip of
scorpions
, and who
start
with horrour at the reflection of their deeds
upon earth, are the fouls of the Gambler
the Prodigalthe
Duelist
, and the Ingrate.
THOSE whom you see yonder,
continued
he,

wasted
, emaciated
spirits
,

souls

most
beautiful fruit,

punishment
is adjuded them
because
most
of
those
vile
passions
, by which men
suffer
themselves
to be ruled, bring real evil, for
promised
good.
FOR this
reason
the
allwise
Judge hath
ordered the
same
passions
still
to inflame
those
ghosts
, with which they were
possessed
on earth
Observe
you
despicable

ghosts

pleas

ure; and with a
ghastly
smile
, brood over
their imaginary riches. Unable to carry
their wealth about with them, they are
confined
to one
spot
, and in one
position
. This
infernal joy is the
source
of their tortures,
for behold them
start
at every
sound
, and
tremble at the flitting of a
shade
. Thus
are they doomed to be their own
tormentors
to
pore over their gold with immortal
fear,
apprehension
, and
jealousy
, and to
guard their ideal wealth with the tears of
care, and the eyes of eternal
watchfulness
.
BEHOLD here, continued my guide;
the
miserable
division

repining
at the ills of life,

LETTER L.
HARRIOT to HARRINGTON.
BOSTON.
Must i
then forget the
endearments
of the lover, and call you by the
name of brother? But does our
friendship
remain upon this foundation? Is this all
that unites us? And has there
subsisted
nothing
more tendera
sentiment
more
voluntary
in our hearts? My feelings affirm that
there has. At the hour of our
first
interview
I felt the
passion
kindle in my
breast
:
Insensible
of my own
weakness
, I indulged its
increasing
violence and delighted in the flame
that fired my
reason
and my
senses
. Do you.
remember our walks, our
conversations
, our
diversions
?The remembrance of
these
things fill my mind with inconceivable
torture
they
seem
to reproach me with
unmerited
criminalityI deprecate, I
detest
all
these
scenes
of gaity and frivolityyet I have
preserved
my innocence and my virtuewhat
then have I to deprecate, what have I to
detest
?
ALAS! how have we been forming
schemes
of
happiness
, and mocking our
hearts with
unsubstantial
joys. Farewel!
farewel! ye gilded
scenes
of imagination.
How have we been deluded by
visionary
prospe
cts, and idly dwelt upon that
happiness
which was never to arrive. How
fleeting
have been the days that were thus
employed
!when
anticipation threw open the
gates of
happiness
, and we vainly
contemplated
the approach of
bliss
;when we
beheld
in
reversion
, the
pleasures
of life, and
fondly
promised
ourselves
, one day to
participate
in them;when we beheld in the
magick mirrour of futurity, the lively group
of loves that
sport
in the train of joy. We
observed
in
transports
of delight the dear
delusion
, and
saw
them, as it were, in bodily
form
pass
in review before us; as the fabled
hero views the region of pr
existant
spirits
,
and beholds a race of men yet to be born.
SUCH was our hope, but even this fairy
anticipation was not irrational. We were
happy in idea, nor was the reality far behind.
And why is the
vision
vanished
? O! I
sink
,
I die, when I reflectwhen I find in my
Harrington
a brotherI am penetrated with
inexpressible
griefI experience uncommon
sensations
I
start
with horrour at the idea
of
incest
of ruinof predition.
HOW do I lament this fatal
discovery
, that
includes the termination of a faithful love!
I think of him to whom I have
resolved

how often have I
resolved
it in my
heart. I indulge, in idea, the recollection of
his
caresses
of his
protestations
, and of his
truth and
sincerity
I become
lost
in a
wilderness
, and
still
I travel on, and find
myself
no nearer an
escape
. I
cherish
the dear
idea of a loverI
see
the danger and do not
wish
to
shun
it,
because
, to avoid it, is to
forget
itAnd can I, at one
stroke
,
erase
from
my mind the remembrance of all in which
my heart
used
to delight? Ah! I have not
the fortitudeI have not the virtue, to
forget
myself
to marble. On the contrary, I
strive
no longer to remember our
present
connexion. I endeavour to forgetI
curse
the idea of a brothermy hand
refuses
to
trace the word, and yet
The name appears
Already written; blot it out my tears!
AH, whence this
sorrow
that
invests
my
soul
! This gloom that darkensthis fire
of
impassioned
grief, that involves all my
thoughts! why do I rave, and why do I
again abandon
myself
to
despair
! Come, O
Harrington!
be a friend, a protector, a
brother
be
him, on whom I could never yet
call by the tender, the endearing title of
parent
. I will reverence him in whom all
the charities of life are unitedI will be
dutiful
and affectionate to you, and you
shall
be unto me as a fatherI will bend on the
knee of
respe
ct and love, and will receive
your
blessing
.
WHY did you go away
so
soon
? Why
leave me when I was incapable of bidding
you adieu? When you
pressed
my cheek
with the
kiss
of love, of fraternal affection,
what meant its
conscious
glow? What meant
the ebullition of my veins, the
disorder
of
my nerves, the intoxication of my brain, the
blood that mantled in my heart? My hand
trembled, and every object
seemed
to
swim
X
before my doubtful view---
Amidst
the
struggle
of
passion
, how could I pronounce
the word---how could I call you by the title
of brother. True---I attempted to
articulate
the found, but it died upon my tongue,
and I fank motionlefs into your arms.
ALLIED by birth, and in mind, and
fimilar in age---and in thought
still
more
intimately
connected, the fympathy which
bound our fouls together, at
first
fight, is lefs
extraordinary. Shall we any longer wonder
at its
irrefistible
impulfe?---Shall we
strive
to
oppofe the
link of nature
that draws us to
each other? When I reflect on this, I
relapse
into
weakness
and
tenderness
, and become a
prey to warring
passions
. I view you in two
distin
ct characters: If I indulge the idea of
one, the other becomes annihilated, and I
vainly imagine I have my choice of a
brother or
I am
for a while calm---but alas! how
momentary is that
calmness
; I dwell with
rupture on what fancy has reprefented; but
is the choice regulated by virtue? Is it
prompted by reafon? I recollect
myself
, and
endeavour to roufe my prudence and
fortitude
;
I abhor my conduct, and
wish
for
obscurity
and
forgetfulness
. Who can bear
the torment of fluctuating
passion
? How
deplorable is the
contest
? The head and the
heart are at variance, but when Nature pleads,
how feeble is the voice of
Reason
? Yet, when
Reason
is heard in her turn, how criminal
appears every
wish
of my heart? What
remorse
do I experience? What horrours
surround
me? Will my feeble frame, already
wasted
by a lingering decline,
support
these
evils? Will the
shattered
, frail bark outride
the
tempest
, and will the waves of affliction
beat in vain? Virtue,
whose
precepts I have
not forgotten, will
assist
me---if not to
surmount
,
at
least
to
suffer
with fortitude and
patience.
OH! I fear, I fear my decaying health
If I
must
depart, let me
beseech
you to
forget meI know the
strength
of your
passion
, and I dread the fatal confequences
my departure may
occasion
you.
ONCE more let me intreat you, my dear
friend, to arm
yourself
with every virtue
which is capable of
fustaining
the
heaviest
calamity. Let the impetuofity of the lover's
passion
be forgotten in the
undisturbed
quietness
of the brother's affection, and may
all the bleffings that life can
supply
be
yoursSeek for content, and you will find
it, even though we
should
never meet again
in this world.
Adieu!

LETTER LIII.

Ingratitude
is a
predominant
principle in the conduct of man.
The perfidious , who owes to me his
reputation and fortune, and with whom I
intrusted
a great part of my property, has
deceived me. This affair will materially
retard my
business
.
TO be unfortunate in trade is not worth a
fighto receive inattention and incivility
does not merit a frown; but
Ingratitude
it
is this that cuts to the quick. Yet I freely
give him my pity; for what man, who
considered
for a moment the
inconfistency
of the
human heart, would hurl the thunderbolt of
indignation at the head of an ingrate? What
an important little thing is man! he
contrives
to overreach his neighbour, and mount
to the enjoyment of riches, ambition and
splendour
; but remembers not the period of
enjoymentthat his life is a day, and his
space
a point!
NATURALISTS inform us of infects
whose
term of
existence
is confined to a few hours
What is the
business
and importance of
such
a life?
WOULD not a being,
whose
circle of living
is
immensity
of ages, inquire with equal
propriety
,
What is the importance of
man
What actions can he performWhat
happiness
can he enjoy,
whose
insignificant
life is
circumscribed
to
seventy
years?
In this point of view I behold the tinfel, the
vanity and
noise
of the world, and the little
plots and cunning artifices of mankind to
cheat and ruin one another.
INGRATITUDE, then, is
constitutional
,
and
inseparable
from human nature, but it
ought not to fill us with
surprize
,
because
it
is no new
discovery
It has ever been
invariably
the chara
cteristick
of man. Is not
the page of antiquity
distained
with the
blood of
those
who ought to have received
honour and adoration? Behold the brilliant
race of the world's benefactors:
Consider
their benevolent actions, and regard their
ungrateful
return
these
benefactors, who have
been
sent
from heaven to inform and
entertain
mankind, to defend the world from the
arm of tyranny, and to open the gates of
salvation
,
have been
despised
, and
banished
, and
poisoned
and crucified.
BEHOLD the
support
of the
Roman
power,
the invincible
Belifarius!
who protected
his country from the ravage of the
Huns
,
and
displayed
the
Roman
eagle in every
quarter
of the globe! Behold him fall a
sacrifice
to malice, to faction and ingratitude! Behold
him
cast
out by the country he had
defended
,
and for which he had
wasted
his
life to protect and honour, and left alone to
deplore his unfortunate condition, when he
was old, and blind, and naked and
miserable
!
UNFORTUNATE is the man who
trusts
his
happiness
to the precarious
friendship
of the
worldI every day become more of a
misanthrope
,
and
see
nothing to
increase
my
desire
of living, but your
esteem
and affection.
I want advice, but am too proud to let the

obligation to any one
else

You
argue as if your
reason
were
pervertedLet your mind be employed, and
time will wear out
these
gloomy ideas; for
it is certainly a truth, that
the love of life in
creases
with age
Your letters, therefore, are
predicated on the
most
erroneous
principles
.
REMEMBER the
story
of the old man, who
had been buried in a dungeon the greater
part of his life, and who was liberated at an
advanced age. He viewed, once more, the
light of the
sun
, and the habitations of men
he had come into a new order of beings,
but found their manners
distasteful
In the
midst
of the
sunshine
of the world, he
remembered
the
prison
, where he had
wasted
his life, and he
sighed
to be again immured
within its walls.
SUCH is our
passion
for life; we love it
because
we know it; and our attachment
becomes
the more riveted, the longer we are
acquainted
with itOur
prison
grows familiar
we contemplate its horroursbut
however
gloomy the walls that
surround
us,
there is not one but
sets
a full value on his
dreary
existence
there is not one but finds
his partiality for his dungeon
increase
, in
proportion
to the time he hath occupied itfor
among the race of human beings confined
to this narrow
spot
how few are they who
are hardy enough to break their
prison
?
LET us watch over all we do with an eye
of
scrutiny

not

I thank
you for your letters,
but I
wish
you had
something
better for the
subje
ct of themthe
sad
repetition of your
feelings and
sorrows
, pains me exceedingly
I
promise
to be with you
soon
perhaps
before you can receive this letter.
WHATEVER concerns my friend,
most
sensibly
affects meYou,
Harrington
, are
the friend of my heart, and nothing has
so
much grieved me as the
story
of your
misfortunes
.
IT is a maxim well received, and
seems
to be admitted an article in the moral creed
of mankind, that the enjoyments of life
do not
compensate
the
miseries
. Since,
then, we are born to
suffer
, and pain
must
attend us in all the
stages
of our journey,
let us
philosophically
welcome our
companion
.
The
most
eligible plan we can adopt,
is to be contented in the condition that
Providence
hath
assigned
us. Let us
trust
that
our burden will not be heavier than we can
bearWhen we adopt this plan, and are
sensible
we have this
trust
, our
lesson
is
complete
we
have learned allwe are arrived
to the perfection of
sublunary
happiness
.
DO not think I am preaching to you a
mere fermon of moralitylet me
impress
your mind with the folly of repining, and the
blessing
of a contented mind.
LET me intreat you not to puzzle your
brain with vain
speculations
if you are
disposed
to argue, do not put
foolish
cases
that never
existed
take the light of facts,
and
reason
from them.
WHEN we are
surrounded
with the
miseries
of
lifethe
baseness
of
false
friendsthe malice
of enemieswhen we are inveloped in
those
anxious fears, the
result
of too much
sensibility
,
human nature feels a degree of
oppression
,
which, without a manly exertion of
reason
and this practical
philosophy
, would be
intolerable. I have heard you mention
St.
Evremond
, as a
philosopher
of this kind.
Arm
yourself
with his prudence and
fortitude
he,
though in exilethough reduced
almost
to penury, and labouring under the
disadvantages
of a bad
constitution
, lived to
be a very old man; he
established
a
course
of rational
pleasures
for when the mind is
employed, we regret the
loss
of timewe
become avaricious of life.
WHEN misfortunes come upon us
without
these
consolations
, it is hard, I
acknowledge
,
Z 2
to buffet the
storm
it is then
human
frailty is
most
apparentthere is
nothing
left to hope
Reason
is taken from the
helm of lifeand Nature
helpless
,
debilitated
Nature
lost
to
herself
, and every
social
duty,
splits
upon the rocks of
despair
and
suicide
. We have
seen
several
examples of
thisBy exploring, and therefore
shunning
the
causes
, let us avoid the
catastrophe
.
THE
pensive
and melancholy will
muse
over the ordinary accidents of life, and
swell
them, by the power of imagination, to the
heaviest
calamities. Hence we find a
treacherous
friend will
sensibly
affect
some
men,
and a capricious
mistress
will
destroy
a real
lover: Hence people in misfortune frequently
construe
the
slightest
inattention into
neglect
and
insult
, and deem their
best
friends
false
and ungrateful. The
sting
of
ingratitude
deeply pierces the heart of
sensibility
.
THE
passions
and affections which
govern
mankind are very
inconsistent
. Men,
confined to the humble walks of life,
sigh
for the enjoyment of wealth and power,
which, when obtained, become loath
some
The mind
unaccustomed
to
such
an
easy
situation
,
is
discontented
, and longs to be
employed
in
those
things in which it was
formerly
exercised
.
THE
greatest
rulers and potentates become

wish
for the charms of
solitude
and retirement, which, when attained,
become more
irksome
than their former
condition

the Fifth, of

to
taste
the
pleasures
of a
recluse
life, by
abdicating
the thronehe
soon
found his
imagination had deceived him, and repented
of the
step
he had taken. This lazy life,
when compared to the
business
and grandeur
of a court, became
tasteless
and
insipid
.
The day,
says
a
historian
, he
resigned
his
crown to his
son
, was the very day in which
he repented making him
such
a
present
.
IT is a great art to learn to be happy in
the
state
in which we are placedI
advise
you to mingle in the concerns of your
acquaintances
be
cheerful and
undisturbed
,
nor give
yourself
up to
those
gloomy ideas,
which tend only to make you more wretched
If
such
obtrude
themselves

LETTER LXV.
WORTHY to Mrs. HOLMES.
BOSTON.
We
have
surmounted
the
performance
of the
last
scene
of our tragedy,
with
less
difficulty and
distress
than I
imagined
.
Great numbers crouded to
see
the
body of poor
Harrington
; they were
impressed
with various emotions, for their
sympathizing
sorrow
could not be concealedIndeed a
man without
sensibility
exhibits no
sign
of a
soul
. I was
struck
with admiration at the
observations
of the populace, and the
justness
of the character they drew of the
deceased
.
Alas!
said
onepoor youth,
thou art gone. Thou
wast
of a
promising
genius, of violent
passions
, thou
wast
possesied
of a too nice
sensibility
, and a dread of
shame
. It is only
such
an one who would
take the trouble to kill
himself
. Ah! poor
well natured, warm hearted, hot headed
youthhow my heart bleeds for you! We
consider
thee as the dupe of Nature, and the
sacrifice
of Seduction.The old father
hears this, and becomes overwhelmed with
shame
and
sorrow
.
THE jury which
sat
upon the body of our
friend, after mature
consideration
, brought in
their verdict SUICIDE. The rigour of the
law was not executedthe body was
privately
taken away, and I
saw
it
deposited
by
the
side
of his faithful
Harriot
.
I SEND you
inclosed
a copy of the
Monumental
Inscription
, as written by
Harrington
.
I found it with many
loose
papers. It
contains
the
story
of our unfortunate friends, and
a profitable moral is deduced from it.
THOUGH a few weeks begin to
spread
a
oalm over our
passions
, yet the recollection
of our misfortunes will
sometimes
cause
a
momentary agitation, as the ocean retains
its
swell
, after the
storm
subsides
.
Adieu!
Monumental
Inscription
.
THOU who
shalt
wander o'er
these
humble plains,
Where one kind grave their
hapless
dust
contains,
O
pass
not onif merit claim a tear,
Or dying virtue
cause
a
sigh
sincere
.
Here
rest
their heads,
consign
'd to parent earth,
Who to one common father ow'd their birth;
Unknown
Unknown this unionNature
still
presides
.
And Sympathy unites, whom Fate divides.
They
see
they lovebut
heaven
their
passion
tries
Their
love
sustains
it, but their
mortal
dies.
Stranger! contemplate well before you part,
And take this
serious
counsel
to thy heart
Does
some
fair female of
unspotted
fame,
Salute thee,
smiling
, with a father's name,
Bid her
detest
the fell Seducer's wiles,
Who
smiles
to winand murders as he
smiles
.
If ever wandering near this dark
recess
,
Where gaurdian
spirits
round the ether
press
;
Where, on their urn,
celestial
care
descends
,
Two lovers come, whom fair
success
attends,
O'er the pale marble
shall
they join their heads,
And drink the falling tears each other
sheds
Then
sadly
say
, with mutual pity
moved
,
0! may we never love as
these
have
loved
.
The END.The Hon. Mr.
Harrington
.
TO the man for whom my bleeding
heart yet retains its wonted affection, though
the author of my guilt and
misery
, do I
address
my feeble complaint---O!
Harrington
,
I am verging to a long eternity---and
Q 2
it is with difficulty I
support
myself
while
my trembling hand traces the dictates of
my heart.
Indisposed
as I am---and
unable
as I feel to
prosecute
this
task
---I
however
collect all my powers to bid you a long
---a final
farewell
.
OH!
Harrington
, I am about to depart
---for why
should
. I tarry here? In bitter
tears of
sorrow
do I weep away the night,
and the returning day but augments the
anguish
of my heart, by recalling to view
the
sad
sight
of my misfortunes. And
have I not
cause
for this
severe
anguish
, at
once the
sorrow
and
disgrace
of my family?
Alas! my poor mother!Death
shall
expiate
the crime of thy daughter, nor longer
raise
the
blush
of indignation on thy
glowing
cheek.Ought I not therefore, to
welcome
the hand of death?
BUT what will become of my poor
helpless
infant, when its mother lies forgotten
in the grave? Wilt thou direct its feet in
the path of virtue and rectitude?Wilt
thou
shelter
it from the ride
blasts
of
penury
and want?Open your heart to
the
solicitude
of a motherof a mother
agonizing
for the future welfare of her child.
Let me intreat you to perform this
request
by the love which you
professed
for thy
Maria
by her life which you have
sacrificed
.
AND wilt thou not drop a tear of pity
in the grave of thy
Maria?
I know thy
soul
is a
soul
of
sensibility
; but my
departure
shall
not grieve theeno, my
Harrington
,
it
shall
not
wrest
a
sigh
from thy
bosom
rather let me live, and defy the malice and
misery
of the worldBut can
tenderness
can love atone for the
sacrifices
I have
made?Will it blot out my errours from the
book of memory? Will love be an
excuse
for my crime, or hide me from the eye of
the malignantNo, my
Harrington
, it will
not. The
passion
is unwarrantable. Be
it thine, gentle
Amelia
be it thine to
check the obtruding
sigh
, and wipe away the
tear from his facefor thou art his wife, and
thy
soul
is the
seat
of
compassion
Butfor
me
Farewelfarewel forever!
Maria
.BELLEVIEW.
SIR,
WE have a
scene
of
distress
at our
house
peculiarly pathetick and affecting, and of
which you, perhaps, are the
sole
authorYou
have had a criminal connexion with
Miss
Fawcet
you have turned her upon the world
inhumanlybut chancerather let me
say
Providence, hath directed her
footsteps
to my
dwelling, where
she
is kindly entertained,
and will be
so
, as long as
she
remains in this
wilderness
world, which is to be, I fear, but
a
short
time---And
shall
she
not, though
she
hath been decoyed from the road that
leadeth
to peace, long life and
happiness
---
shall
she
not, if
she
return with tears of
repentance
and contrition, be entitled to our
love and charity? Yes---this is my doctrine
---If I behold any child of human nature
distressed
and forlorn, and in real want of the
necessities
of life,
must
I
restrain
or withhold
the hand of charity---
must
I
cease
to recal
the departing
spirit
of them that are ready to
perish
, until I make diligent inquiry into
their
circumstances
and character? Surely,
my friend, it is a duty incumbent on us by
the ties of humanity and fellow feeling, and
by the duty
imposed
on us by our holy
religion
,
equally to extend the hand of relief
to
all the
necessitous
however they may be
circumstanced
in the great family of
mankind
.
THE crime of
Maria
is not the
blackest
in the annals of human turpitude; but
however
guilty
she
might have been, the tears of
penitence do certainly make atonement
therefor.
THUS much have I thought proper to
say
in vindication of my conduct---in
sheltering
under my roof a poor wandererwho
hath
strayed
, but not wantonly, and who
hath now happily returned.
ONE would imagine, there was little
necessity
of making
such
a vindication to you;
but my
sentiments
always flow from the
abundance of my heart, and I am willing the
whole world
should
judge of
those
which
influence my conductNow, though
some
men,
whose
charity is contracted, and
who may be denominated
prudes in virtue
,
might deem wrongfully of my attention to
the calamity of this frail womanyet let
me appeal to the hearts and
understandings
of all men, and
these
in particular, if I have
erred, whether it be not an errour on the
side
of humanity. Would to God
such
amiable errours were more frequent!In
as much, my friend, as there is joy in heaven
over one
sinner
that repenteth, I may
say
with
assurance
that I have felt an emanation
of this heavenly joy animate my heart, in
beholding this woman delighting to
steer
her
course
heavenward.
FROM the unhappy condition of
Maria
,
I have been led to reflect on the
mischievous
tendency of SEDUCTION. Methinks I
view the
distressing
picture in all its horrid
colours.
R
BEHOLD the youthful virgin arrayed
in all the delightful charms of vivacity,
modesty
and
sprightliness
Behold even while
she
is
rising
in beauty and dignity, like a lily
of the valley, in the full
blossom
of her
graces,
she
is cut off
suddenly
by the rude
hand of the Seducer. Unacquainted with
his
beseness
and treachery, and too ready to
repose
confidence in him
she
is deluded
by the
promises
and flattery of the man who
professes
the
greatest
love and
tenderness
for
her welfare:But did
she
understand
the
secret
villainy of his intentionswould
she
appear thus elate and joyous? Would
she
assent
to her ruin? Would
she
subscribe
her name to the catalogue of infamy? Would
she
kiss
the hand of the atrocious
dastard
,
already
raised
to give the final wound to her
reputation and peace?
O! WHY is there not an adequate
punishment
for this crime, when that of a
common
traitor is marked with its
deserved
iniquity
and abhorrence!
IS it
necessary
to depicture the
slate
of
this deluded young creature after her fall
from virtue? Stung with
remorse
, and
frantick
with
despair
, does
she
not fly from the
face of day, and
secrete
her
conscious
head in
the
bosom
of eternal
forgetfulness
?
Melancholy
and guilt transfix her heart, and
she
sighs
out her
miserable
existence
the prey
of poverty, ignominy and reproach!
Lost
to the world, to her friends, and to
herself
,
she
blesses
the approach of death in whatever
shape
he may appear, that terminates a life,
no longer a
blessing
to its
possessour
, or a joy
to
those
around her.
BEHOLD her
stretched
upon the
mournful
bier!Behold her
silently
descend
to the
grave!Soon the wild weeds
spring
afresh
round the
little hillock
, as if to
shelter
the
remains
of betrayed innocenceand the
friends of her youth
shun
even the
spot
which
conceals her relicks.
SUCH is the
consequence
of SEDUCTION,
but it is not the only
consequence
. Peace
and
happiness
fly the nuptial couch which is
unattended by love and fidelity. The mind
no longer enjoys its quiet, while it
ceases
to
cherish
sentiments
of truth and gratitude.
The
sacred
ties
of connubial duty are not to
be violated with impunity; for though a
violation of
those
ties
may be overlooked by
the eye of
justice
, the heart
shall
supply
a
monitor
, who will not fail to correct
those
,
who are hardy enough to
burst
them
asunder
.I
am, &c.
W.
Holmes
.Hon. Mr. Harrington to the Rev. Mr.
Holmes.
PERMIT me, my ever honoured
friend, to return you thanks for your late
favours
need
I addan acknowledgment
for your liberality? Noyour heart
supplies
a
source
of
pleasure
which is
constantly
nourished
by your
goodness
and
universal
charity.
THE picture you have exhibited of a
ruined
female is undoubtedly
just
, but that the
R 2
rude
spoiler
has his
share
of
remorse
is
equally
so
The
conclusion
of your letter is a real
picture of the
situation
of my heart.
PERHAPS you was always ignorant of
the real motives that influenced me, and
gave a particular bias to my conductAt
an early period of my life, I adopted a
maxim
,
that
the
most
necessary
learning was a
knowledge
of the world
, the
pursuit
of which,
quadrating
with a volatility of
disposition
,
presented
a variety of
scenes
to my heated
imagination
.
The
eclat
of my companions
gratifying my vanity and
increasing
the gale
of
passion
, I became
insensibly
hurried down
the
stream
of
dissipation
. Here I
saw
mankind
in every point of viewfrom the
acme of the
most
consummate
refinement,
to the
most
adject
stage
of degradation. I
soon
became a ready proficient in the great
school
of the worldbut an alteration of
conduct was
soon
after
necessary
I was
compelled to it, not
so
much from the
world's abhorrence of a
dissolute
course
of
life, as the dictates of my own heartIt
was, indeed, my policy to flatter the world,
and exhibit a fair
outside
for I was in love
with
Amelia
My licentious amour with
Maria
was
secret
she
was affectionate and
tenderher manners were
pleasing
, but
still
I was unhappy.
MY career of
dissipation
, however
alluring
it
struck
my vitiated fancy, left little
satisfaction
on the mindReflection had its
turnand the
happiness
I had
promised
myself
in a connexion with the amiable
Amelia
,
I fully enjoyed in our marriage. A
course
of uninterrupted tranquillity
ensued
, but it
was of
short
duration. The volatility of
my temper, and the folicitude of my old
associates
,
induced me at
subsequent
periods
to fall again into my old vagaries. The
taverns frequently found me engaged in
meannesses
derogatory to the character of
a gentleman.
These
things I perceived
affected
the foul of
Amelia
she
was all
meekness
,
gentleness
and
compassion
, and
she
never once upbraided me with my illiberal
conduct:
But let concealment, like a worm in the bud,
Feed on her
damask
cheek.
BLESSED he that power who has
implanted
within us that
consciousness
of
reproach
,
which
springs
from
gentleness
and
love!Hail
sensibility
! Ye eloquent
tears
of
beauty!
that add dignity to human nature
by correcting its foiblesit was
these
that
corrected my faults when recrimination
would have failed of
success
it was
these
that opened every avenue of contrition in
my heart, when
words
would have dammed
up every fluice of repentance.
IT was now I appeared fully
sensible
that my conduct had hitherto been a
course
of
disorder
, and that
systems
of
reformation
,
however well planned, had
been overturned by the breath of
adulation
,
before they had been thoroughly
carried into executionthat I had been
drifting upon a
sea
of
inconsistency
, without
exercising
my judgment; like a
ship
without
a rudder, buffetted on the
bosom
of the
ocean
,
the
sport
of winds and waves.
THE criminality of my connexion with
Maria
appeared with the
most
aggravated
circumstances
; it
stung
me with
remorse
and I
instantly
determined, however fevere
the conflict, to tear her from my
bosom
to
see
her no more.But how was I to inform
her of it?In what manner was I to bring
about
such
a
task
?
Maria
must
be
sacrificed
to the
happiness
of
Amelia
. This was
all I had to performit was a
short
lesson
,
but it was a hard one for me to execute.
WITH this determination, however, I
entered the apartment of
Maria
Duty to
Amelia
and gratitude to
Maria
interchangeably
agitated methe contention was
dubious
but
duty prevailed, and I adhered to my
former
resolution
yet how was I to tell her
this would be the
last
visit
?
Conscious
she
had ever acted in conformity to my
wishes
how could I
accuse
her, without
accusing
myself
?I threw out a few
inconsiderate
,
and ungrateful hints of
jealousy
, and left the
room abruptly. The feelings of
Maria
must
have been injuredbut however her
sensibility
was affected, mine was doubly
so
;
I felt for herI felt for our infant, and
these
feelings were added to the afflictions
which had already
burst
upon my devoted
head. A few days
consideration
, however,
convinced me of the impropriety and
ingratitude
of my behaviour to
Maria
I
hastened
to tell her of itto place her in a
situation
that
should
screen
her from penury and
malice
and
to make
provision
for the child
but,
she
was not to be found. I was
informed
that
she
had
suddenly
disappeared
, and
that a countryman had, by her order, called
and taken away the child but a few hours
before. This information
burst
upon my
head like the voice of
sudden
thunderI
stood
motionless
, but my agitation was too
violent to be of any long duration.
A natural tear I
shed
, but wip'd it
soon
.
IT was your
goodness
, and the
humanity
of your family, that
sheltered
the wretched
Maria
, and provided for the
helpless
Harriot
Your feelings are your reward.
FROM all the variegated
scenes
of my
past
life, I daily learn
some
new
lesson
of
humanity
.
Experience hath been my tutor
I now take a
retrospe
ct of my
past
conduct
with deliberation, but not without
some
serious
reflection: Like a
sailor
escaped
from
shipwreck
, who
sits
safely
on the
shore
and
views the
horrors
of the
tempest
; but as
the gale
subsides
, and the waves hide their
heads in the
bosom
of the deep, he beholds
with greater concern the
mischief
of the
storm
and the dangers he hath
escaped
.
From what innate principle does this
arise
,
but from the
God within the mind!
I
assert
it for the honour of human nature, that no
man, however
dissolute
but comes back to
the hour of reflection and
solemn
thoughtfulness
S
when the actions that are
passed
return upon the mind, and this
internal
monitor
sits
in judgment upon them, and gives
her verdict of approbation or
dislike
.
HE who
listens
to its call, views his
character
in its proper lightI have attended to
its cry, and I
see
my deformityI recal my
mispent
time, but in vainI reflect on the
misery
of
Maria
, and I
curse
my temerity
I reflect on the
state
into which I have
plunged
a once happy female, and am eager to
apply a
speedy
remedy, but this is vain
also
:
Can I
restore
her that virtuethat innocence
that peace, of which I have unmanfully
robbed her?Let us leave the
melancholy
subje
ct.
I WILL not
so
far
supersede
the fruit of
your benevolence, as to
presume
to offer you
any other
recompense
, than my
sincere
prayers for your
happiness
.
I have the honour to be,
With
respe
ct,
Your &c.
