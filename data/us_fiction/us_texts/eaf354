MARTIN FABER.
CHAPTER I.
This is a fearful precipice, but I dare
look upon it. What, indeed, may I not
darewhat have I not dared! I look
before
me, and the prospect, to most men full
of terrors, has few or none for me.
Without
adopting too greatly the spirit of cant
which makes it a familiar phrase in the
mouths of the many, death to me will prove
a release from many strifes and terrors. I do
not fear death. I look behind me, and though
I may regret my crimes, they give me no
compunctious apprehensions. They were
among the occurrences known to, and a
necessary
sequence in the progress of time and
the world's circumstance. They might have
been committed by another as well as by
myself
.
They must have been committed! I
was but an instrument in the hands of a power
with which I could not contend.
Yet, what a prospect, does this backward
glance afford! How full of colors and
characters
How
variously dark and bright. I
am dazzled and confounded at the various
phases of my own life. I wonder at the
prodigious
strides which my own feet have taken
and as I live and must die, I am bold to
declare
,in
half the number of instances,
without
my own consciousness. Should I be
considered
the criminal, in deeds so committed?
Had not my arm been impelledhad not my
mood been prompted by powers and an
agency
apart from my own, I had not struck the
blow. The demon was not of me, though
presiding over, and prevailing within, me. Let
those who may think, when the blood is
boiling
in their temples, analyze its throbs and the
source of its impulses. I cannot. I am a
fatalist. Enough for me that it was written!
My name is Martin Faber. I am of good
familyof German extractionthe only son.
I was born in M village, and my
parents
were recognized as among the first in
respectability and fortune of the place. The
village was smallnumbering some sixty
families
;
and with a naturally strong and shrewd,
and a somewhat improved mind, my father,
Nicholas Faber, became the first man in it.
The village of M, was one of those that
always keep stationary. The prospect was
slight, therefore, of our family declining in
influence
.
My father, on the contrary, grew
every day stronger in the estimation of the
people. He was their oracletheir counsellor
his word was law, and there were no rival
pretensions set up in opposition to his
supremacy
.
Would this had been less the case!
Had Nicholas Faber been more his own, than
the creature of others, Martin, his son, had
not now obliterated all the good impressions
of his family, and been called upon, not only
to recount his disgrace and crime, but to pay
its penalties. Had he bestowed more of his
time in the regulation of his household, and
less upon public affairs, the numberless
vicious
propensities, strikingly marked in me
2*
from childhood up, had, most probably been
sufficiently restrained. But why speak of
this? As I have already saidit was written!
The only child, I was necessarily a
favorite
.
The pet of mama, the prodigy of papa,
I was schooled to dogmatize and do as I
pleased from my earlier infancy. I grew
apace, but in compliance with maternal
tenderness
,
which dreaded the too soon exposure
of her child's nerves, health and sensibilities, I
was withheld from school for sometime after
other children are usually put in charge of a
tutor. When sent, the case was not very
greatly amended. I learned nothing, or what
I learned was entirely obliterated by the
nature
of my education and treatment at home.
I cared little to learn, and my tutor dared not
coerce me. His name was Michael Andrews.
He was a poor, miserable hireling, who having
a large and depending family, dared not offend
by the chastisement of the favorite son of a
person of so much consequence as my father.
Whatever I said or did, therefore, went by
without notice, and with the most perfect
impunity
.
I was a truant, and exulted in my
irregularities, without the fear or prospect of
punishment. I was brutal and boorish
savage
and licentious. To inferiors I was
wantonly
cruel. In my connexion with superiors,
I was cunning and hypocritical. If, wanting
in physical strength, I dared not break ground
and go to blows with my opponent, I,
nevertheless
,
yielded not, except in appearance. I
waited for my time, and seldom permitted the
opportunity to escape, in which I could revenge
myself with tenfold interest, for provocation
or injustice. Nor did I discriminate between
those to whom this conduct was exhibited. To
all alike, I carried the same countenance. To
the servant, the schoolmaster, the citizen, and
even to my parents, I was rude and insolent.
My defiance was ready for them all, and when,
as sometimes, even at the most early stages
of childhood, I passed beyond those bounds of
toleration, assigned to my conduct, tacitly, as it
were, by my father and mother, my only rebuke
was in some such miserably unmeaning
language
as this`Now, my dearnow Martin
how can you be so bad'or, `I will be
vexed with you, Martin, if you go on so.'
What was such a rebuke to an overgrown
boy, to whom continued and most unvarying
deference, on all hands, had given the most
extravagant idea of his own importance. I
bade defiance to threatsI laughed at and
scorned reproaches. I ridiculed the soothings
and the entreaties of my mother; and her gifts
and toys and favors, furnished in order to tempt
me to the habits which she had not the
courage
to compel, were only received as things
of course, which it was her duty to give me.
My father, whose natural good sense,
sometimes
made him turn an eye of misgiving
upon
my practices, wanted the stern sense of
duty which would probably have brought
about a different habit; and when, as was
occasionally
the case, his words were harsh and
his look austere, I went, muttering curses,
from his presence, and howling back my
defiance
for his threats. I was thus brought up
without a sense of proprietywithout a
feeling
of fear. I had no respect for authority
no regard for morals. I was a brute from
education
,
and whether nature did or not,
contribute
to the moral constitution of the creature
which I now appear, certain, I am, that the
course of tutorship which I received from all
around me, would have made me so. You
will argue from this against my notion of the
destinies, since I admit, impliedly, that a
different
course of education, would have brought
about different results. I think not. The
case is still the same. I was fated to be so
tutored.
CHAPTER II.
There was at the school to which I went,
a boy about twelve, the same age with myself.
His name was William Hardinghe was the
only child of a widow lady, living a retired
lifeof blameless character, and a disposition
the most amiable and shrinking. This
disposition
was inherited by her son, in the most
extravagant degree. He had been the child
of affliction. His father had been murdered
in a night affray in a neighbouring city, and
his body had been brought home to the house
and presence of his lady, when she was far
advanced in pregnancy. The sudden and
terrible
character of the shock brought on the
pains of labour. Her life was saved with
difficulty
,
and, seemingly by miraculous
interposition
,
the life of her infant was also preserved.
But he was the creature of the deepest
sensibility
.
His nervous organization was
peculiarly
susceptible. He was affected by
circumstances
the most trifling and casual
trembled
and shrunk from every unwonted breeze
withered beneath reproach, and pined under
neglect. So marked a character, presenting
too, as it did, a contrast, so strikingly with my
own, attracted my attention, at an early period
of our school association. His dependence,
his weakness, his terrorsall made him an
object
of a consideration which no other character
would have provoked. I loved himstrange
to sayand with a feeling of singular power.
I fought his battlesI never permitted him to
be imposed upon:and hecould he do less?
he assisted me in my lessons, he worked my
sums, he helped my understanding in its
deficiencies
,
he reproved my improprietiesand
II bore with and submitted patiently on most
occasions to his reproofs. William Harding
was a genius, and one of the first order; but
his nervous susceptibilities left him perfectly
hopeless and helpless. Collision with the
world of man would have destroyed him; and,
as it was, the excess of the imaginative quality
which seemed to keep even pace with his
sensibilities
,
left him continually strugglingand
as continually to the injury and overthrow of
the latterwith the calm suggestions of his
judgment. He was a creature to be loved and
pitied; and without entertaining, at this period,
a single sentiment savoring of either of these,
3
for any other existing being, I both loved and
pitied him.
One day, to the surprize of all, William
Harding appeared in his class, perfectly
ignorant
of his lesson. The master did not
punish
him with stripes, but, as the school was
about to be dismissed, commanding the
trembling
boy before him, he hung about his neck
a badge made of card, on which was
conspicuously
printed, the word `idler.'With this
badge he was required to return home,
re-appearing
at school with it the ensuing afternoon.
A more bitter disgrace could not, by any
ingenuity, have been put upon the proud and
delicate spirit of this ambitious boy. I never
saw dismay more perfectly depicted upon any
countenance. His spirit did not permit him
to implore. But his eyeit spoke volumes
of appealit was full of entreaty. The old
man saw it not. The school was dismissed,
and, in a paroxysm of grief which seemed to
prostrate every faculty, my companion threw
himself upon the long grass in the
neighbourhood
of the school-house, and refused to be
comforted. I sought him out, and curious to
know the cause of an omission which in him
was remarkable, and should therefore have
been overlooked by our tutor, I enquired of
him the reason. The cruelty of his
punishment
was now more than ever, apparent to
my eyes. His mother had been ill during the
whole previous night, and he had been
keeping
watch and attending upon her. I was
indignant
,
and urged him to throw aside the card
beneath the trees, and resume it upon his
return
to the school. But he would not descend
to the meanness of such an act, and resolutely
determined to bear his punishment. I was of
a different temper. Grown bold and confident
by the frequent indulgencies which had so
often sanctioned my own aberrations, I had
already
assumed the burdens of my comrades,
escaping myself, while effecting their escape.
Should I now hesitate, when a sense of
justice
,
and a feeling of friendly sympathy
coalesced
towards the same end, both calling upon
me for action. I did not. I seized upon the
accursed tablet. I tore it from his bosom, and
hacking it to pieces of the smallest dimensions,
I hurled them to the winds, declaring, at the
same time, his freedom, with a shout. He
would have resisted, and honestly and
earnestly
endeavored to prevent the commission
of the act. But in vain, and with a feeling of
the truest satisfaction, I beheld him return home
to his suffering parent. But my turn was to
come. I had no fears for the consequence,
having been accustomed to violate the rules of
school, with impunity. Harding appearing
without his badge, was questioned, and firmly
refused to answer. I boldly pronounced my
handiwork, no one else venturing to speak,
fearing my vengeance, though several in the
school, had been cognizant of the whole affair.
At the usual hour of dismissal, I was
instructed
to remain, and when all had departed, I was
taken by the master, into a small adjoining
apartment, in which he usually studied and
kept his books, and which formed the passage
way from his school-room to his
dwelling-house
.
Here I was conducted, and
wondering
and curious, at these preliminaries, here I
3*
awaited his presence. I had been guilty of
insubordination and insurrection, and was not
altogether sure that he would not proceed to
flog me. But not so. He spoke to me like a
fatheras my father had never spoken to me
his words were those of monitorial kindness
and regard. He described the evil
consequences
to his authority if such conduct were
tolerated; and contented himself with
requiring
from me a promise of apology before the
assembled school on the ensuing morning. I
laughed in his face. He was indignant, as
well he might be, and, under the momentary
impulse, he gave me a smart blow with his
open hand upon my cheek. I was but a boy
some thirteen or fourteen years of age,but,
at that moment, I measured with my eye the
entire man before me, and though swelling
with fury, coolly calculated the chances of
success in a physical struggle. Had there
been a stick or weapon, of any description at
hand, I might not have hesitated. As it was,
however, prudence came to my counsel. I
submitted, though my heart rankled, and my
spirit burned within me for revenge;and I
had ityears afterwards I had ita deep, a
dreadful revenge. For the time, however, I
contented myself with one more congenial
with the little spirit of a bad and brutal boy.
In school-boy phrase, he kept me inhe took
from me my freedom, locking me up safely in
the little study, into which I had been
conducted
.
While in that room shut up, what were my
emotions! The spirit of a demon was
working
within me, and the passions acting upon
my spirit nearly exhausted my body. I threw
myself upon the floor, and wepthot, scalding
and bitter tears. I stamped, I raved, I swore.
On a sudden I heard the voice of Harding
mournfully addressing me through the
partition
which separated the school room from my
dungeon. He had come to sympathize, and,
if possible, to assist me. But I would not
knowI would not hear him. The gloomy
frend was uppermost, and I suddenly became
silent. I would not answer his inquiriesI
was dumb to all his friendly appeals. In vain
did the affectionate boy try every mode of
winning me to hear and to reply. I was
stubborn
,
and, at length, as the dusk came on, I
could hear his departing footsteps, as he had
slowly and sorrowfully given up his object in
despair. He was gone, and I rose from the
floor, upon which I had thrown myself. The
first paroxysms of my anger had gone off, and
their subdued expression gave me an
opportunity
more deeply to investigate my injuries,
and meditate my revenge. I strode up and
down the apartment for sometime, when, all
of a sudden, I beheld the two large, new and
beautiful globes, which my teacher had but
a little while before purchased at a large price,
and not without great difficulty, from his little
savings. He was a philosopher, and this
study was one of his greatest delights. My
revenge stood embodied before me. I felt
that I too could now administer pain and
punishment
.
Though small in proportion to what,
it appeared to me, my wrongs required, I well
knew that to injure his globes, would be
almost
the severest injury I could inflict upon
their owner. I did not pausethe demon
was impatient. I seized the jug of ink that
stood upon the shelf below them, and carefully
poured its contents upon the beautifully
varnished
and colored outlines of the celestial
regions. They were ruinedirreparably
ruined
;
and where the ink, in its course, had
failed to obliterate the figures, I took care that
the omission should be amended by
employing
a feather, still further to complete their
destruction. This, you may say, is quite too
trifling an incident for record. No such thing.
The child's the parent of the man. In one
sense, the life of the child is made up of
trifles; but the exercises of his juvenile years
will at all times indicate what they will be
when he becomes old. The same passions
which prompted the act just narrated, would
move the grown incendiary to the firing of his
neighbor's dwelling. The same passions
prompted me in after years to exaggerated
offences. How could it be otherwise? They
were my fate!
Vainly would I endeavor to describe the
rage, the agony of wrath, which came over the
face of my tutor upon discovering what I had
done. It is fresh in my memory, as if the
occurrence
had taken place but yesterday. I
was in the study, where he had left me, upon
his return. Indeed, I could not effect my
escape
,
or I had certainly done so. The room
was dark, and for some time, walking to and
fro, and exhorting me in the most parental
manner as he walked, he failed to perceive his
globes or the injury they had sustained. In
this way, he went on, speaking to me, in a
way, which, had not my spirit been acted on
by the arch enemy of man, must have had the
effect of compelling me to acknowledge and to
atone, by the only mode in my power, for my
errors and misconduct. I had, indeed, begun
to be touched. I felt a disposition to regret
my act, and almost inclined to submission and
apology. But on a sudden, he pausedthe
globes caught his eyehe approached and
inspected
them narrowly. Passing his hands
over his eyes, he seemed to doubt the
correctness
of his vision; but when he
ascertained
,
for a truth, the extent of the evil, tears
actually started from the decaying orbs, and
rolled as freely as from the eyes of childhood,
down his lean and wrinkled face. Then was
my triumph. I gloated in his suffering, and,
actually, under the most involuntary impulse,
I approached, and keenly watched his
suffering
.
He beheld my approachhe saw the
demon look of exultation which I wore; and
human passion triumphed. He turned shortly
upon me, and with a severe blow of his fist,
he smote me to the ground. I was half
stunned
,
but soon recovered, and with a degree of
unconsciousness, perfectly brutish, I rushed
upon him. But he was too much for me. He
held me firmly with one hand, and, his anger
now more fully provoked by my attack, he
inflicted
upon me a very severe flogging
almost
the only one which I had ever received.
It was certainly most richly deserved; but I
thought not so then. I looked upon myself as
the victim of a most unjustifiablea most
wanton persecution. I did not, for a moment,
consider the vast robbery I had made from
4
that poor old man's small stock of happiness
and enjoyment. My feelings were all
concentrated
in self; and my ideas of justice, where
my own interests or emotions were concerned,
were in no degree abstract. I knew but one
being in the world, whose claims were to be
considered, and that individual, was, of course,
myself.
I was now dismissed, and sore and smarting
in body and mind, I returned to my home. I
showed my bruises; I fabricated a story of
greater wrongs and injuries. I dwelt upon the
unprovoked aggression; taking care to
suppress
all particulars which might have
modified
the offence of my teacher. The flogging
he had given me, had been a most severe one
and, the cause not being heard, would seem
to have been most brutal. This was another
part of my revenge, and it had its consequences.
A solemn convocation of the chief men of the
village, of whom my father was the dictator,
incensed at the indignity, as it met their
senses, and relying upon my
ex parte
representation
,
determined, without further hearing,
upon the offence. Michael Andrews lost his
school with every circumstance of ignominy;
and in a most pitiable condition of poverty, in
a few weeks, was compelled to leave the place.
I was yet unsatisfiedmy revenge was not
altogether completeboy as I wasunless I
could actually survey it. I went to see him
depart. I watched him, as in a miserable
wagon
,
containing all his household gear, he
drove into the adjacent country, attended by a
wife and four young children. I exulted in
the prospect; as, from a little hillock which
overlooked the road they were compelled to
travel, I looked down upon their departure.
They beheld me, and the faces of all were
immediately turned away. There is a
dignified
something in decent sorrow, and
suffering
borne in silence, which places it above,
while it forbids anything like the spoken taunt
or triumph;I had otherwise shouted my
cry of victory in their ears. As it was, they
proceeded on their way into the country. I
was, at length, satisfied with my revenge, and
did not care to follow them.
CHAPTER III.
Under the direction of a more supple tutor
than the first, I finished my education, if so
we may call it. William Harding was still
my associate. He was still the same nervous,
susceptible, gentle youth; and though, as he
grew older, the more yielding points of his
character became modified in his associations
with society, he nevertheless did not vary in
his mental and moral make, from what I have
already described him. Though disapproving
of many of my habits and propensities, and
continually exhorting me upon them, he yet
felt the compliment which my spirit,
involuntarily
,
as it were, rendered to his; and he was
4*
not at any time averse to the association which
I tendered him. Still he was like me in few
respects, if any. It is the somewhat popular
notion that sympathy in pursuit, and opinions
and sentiments in common, bring about the
connexions of friendship and love. I think
differently. Such connexions spring from a
thousand causes which have no origin in
mutual
sympathies. The true source of the
relationship
is the dependence and weakness on
the one handthe strength and protection on
the other. This, I verily believe, was the fact
in our case.
With little other society than that of
William
Harding, years glided away, and if they
brought little improvement to my moral
attributes
they,
at least, bringing no
provocation
,
left in abeyance and dormancy, many of
those which were decidedly immoral. My
physical man was decidedly improved in their
progress. My features underwent
considerable
change for the bettermy manners were
far less objectionableI had suppressed the
more rude and brutal features, and, mingling
more with societythat particularly of the
other
sexI had seen and obeyed the necessity of
a gentlemanly demeanor. But my heart
occupied
the same place and characterthere was
no change in that region. There, all was
stubborness
and selfishnessa scorn for the
possessions
and claims of othersa resolute and
persevering impulse which perpetually sought
to exercise and elevate its own. The spell of
my fate was upon itit seemed seared and
souredand while it blighted, and sought to
blight the fortunes and the feelings of others,
without any sympathy, it seemed
nevertheless
,
invariably, to partake of the blight. In
this respect, in the vexation of my spirit at this
strange inconsistency of character, I used to
curse myself, that I was not like the serpent
that I could not envenom my enemy, without
infecting my own system, with the poison
meant only for his. To this mood, the want of
employment gave activity if not exercise and
exhibition. The secretions of my malignity,
having no object of development, jaundiced
my whole moral existence; and a general
hostility
to human nature and the things of society,
at this stage of my being, vented itself in idle
curses, and bitter but futile denunciations. I
lived only in the night timemy life has been
a long night, in which there has been no
starlight
in
which there have been many
tempests
.
Talk not of Greenland darkness, or
Norwegian ice. The moral darkness is the
most solidand what cold is there like that,
where, walled in a black dungeon of hates and
fears and sleepless hostility, the heart broods
in bitterness and solitude, over its own
cankering
and malignant purposes.
Many years had now elapsed since my
adventure
with Michael Andrews, my old
school-master
.
I had grown up to manhood, and my
personal appearance, had been so completely
changed by the forming hand of time, that I
had not the same looks which distinguished
me at that period. One morning, pursuing a
favorite amusement, I had wandered with my
gun for some distance, into a part of the
country
,
which was almost entirely unknown to
me. The game, though plentiful, was rather
shy, and in its pursuit, I was easily seduced
to a greater distance from our village, and on
the opposite side of a stream, which though
not a river, was yet sufficiently large,
particularly
when swollen by freshets,a not
unfrequent
eventto make something like a
barrier
and dividing line between two divisions of
the country. The day was fine, and without
being at all conscious of the extent of my
wanderings, I proceeded some fourteen or
fifteen
miles. My way led through a close and
umbrageous forest. A grove of dwarf or scrub
oaks, woven about with thick vines and
sheltering
foliage, gave a delightful air of
quietness
to the scene, which could not fail
altogether
in its effect on a spirit as discontented and
querulous even as mine. Wandering from
place to place in the silent and seemingly
sacred
haunt of the dreamy nature, I perceived,
for the first time, a clear and beautifully
winding
creek, that stole in and out, half sheltered
by the shrubbery growing thickly about it
now narrowing into a thin stream, and almost
lost among the leaves, and now spreading
itself
out in all the rippling and glassy beauty
of a sylvan and secluded lake. I was won
with its charms, and pursued it in all its
bendings
.
The whole scene was unique in
loveliness
.
The hum of the unquiet breeze, now
resting among, and now flying from the slowly
waving branches above, alone broke, at
intervals
,
the solemn and mysterious repose of that
silence, which here seemed to have taken up
its exclusive abode. Upon a bank that jutted
so far into the lake by a winding approach, as
almost to seem an island, the trees had been
taught to form themselves into a bower; while
the grass, neatly trimmed within the
enclosure
,
indicated the exercise of that art, whose
hand has given life to the rock, and beauty to
the wilderness. I was naturally attracted by
the prospect, and approaching it from the
point most sheltered, came suddenly into the
presence of a tall and beautiful girl, about
fifteen
years of age, sitting within its shade,
whose eyes cast down upon some needlework
which she had in her hands, enabled me to
survey, for sometime before she became
conscious
of my presence, the almost singular
loveliness of feature and person which she
possessed. She started, and trembled with a
childish timidity at my approach, which not a
little enhanced the charm of her beauty in my
eyes. I apologized for my intrusion; made
some commonplace inquiry and remark, and
we soon grew familiar. The cottage in which
her parents resided, was but a little way off,
and I was permitted to attend her home.
What was my surprize to discover in the
person
of her father, my old tutor. But,
fortunately
for me, he was not in a condition to
recognize
me. His mind and memory were in
great part gone. He still contrived,
mechanically
as it were, to teach the `accidence' to
three white-headed urchins, belonging to the
neighborhood, and in this way, with the
industry
of his daughters, the family procured a
tolerable livelihood. I was treated kindly by
the old people, and had certainly made some
slight impression on Emilythe maiden I
had accompanied. I lingered for some hours
in her companyand, though timid,
uneducated
5
and girlish in a great degree, I was
fascinated
by her beauty, her gentleness, and the
angelic smile upon her lips.
It was late in the day when I left the house
of old Andrews. He had heard my name,
and showed no emotion. He had evidently
forgotten all the circumstances of my boyhood
in connexion with himself. I could then
venture
to returnto repeat my visitsto see
once more, and when I pleased, the sweet
object
,
whose glance had aroused in my bosom
an emotion of sense and sentiment entirely
unknown
to it before. We did meet, and each
returning day found me on the same route.
Our intimacy increased, and she became my
ownshe was my victim.
CHAPTER IV.
That girl was the most artlessthe most
innocent of all God's creatures. Strange! that
she should be condemned as a sacrifice to the
wishes of the worst and wildest. But, it was
her fate, not less than mine! Need I say that
Iwhose touch has cursed and contaminated
all whose ill fortunes doomed them to any
connexion with meI blighted and blasted
that innocence, and changed the smile into the
tear, and the hope into the sorrow, of that fond
and foolishly confiding creature. We were
both, comparatively, children.She was,
indeed
,
in all respects a childbut II had
lived yearsmany years of concentrated
wickedness
and crime. To do wrong was to be
myselfit was natural. That I should
deceive
and dishonor, is not therefore matter of
surprize; but that there should be no
guardian
angelno protecting shield for the unwary
and the innocent, would seem to manifest an
unwise improvidence in the dispenser of things.
A few months of our intimacy only had
elapsed
.
In the quiet and secluded bower where
we had first met, she lay in my arms. I had
wrought her imagination to the utmost. With
a stern sense and consciousness, all the while,
of what I was doing, I had worked
industriously
upon the natural passions of her bosom.
Her lips were breathing and burning beneath
my own. Her bosom was beating violently
against mine. My arm encircled and
clasped
her closely. There was a warm languor
in the atmospherethe trees murmured not
the winds were at reposeno warning voice
rose in the woodsno tempest blackened in
the skythe shrill scream of a solitary bird
at that moment might have broken the spell
might have saved the victim. But the scream
came notthe fates had decreed itbody and
soul, the victim was mine. She was no
longer
the pure, the glad, the innocent and
unstained
angel I had first known her. Her
eyes were now downcast and fearfulher
frame trembled with all the consciousness of
guilt. She gave up all to her affection for
one so worthlessso undeserving as myself:
yet had she not my affections, though loving
me, even as the young and morning flower
may be seen to link and entwine itself with
and about the deadly and venomous
nightshade
?
5*
Our intercourse was continued in this way
for several months. The consequences now
began to threaten Emily with exposure, and
she hourly besought me to provide against
them by our marriage, as I had already
frequently
promised her to do. But I had no
idea of making any such sacrifice. The
passion
which had prompted me at first, had no
longer a place in my bosom. I did not any
longer continue to deceive myself with the
belief
that she either was or could be any thing
to me. She had few attractions now in my
sight, and though still beautiful, more
touchingly
so, indeed, from an habitual sadness
which her features had been taught to wear,
than ever,I had learned to be disgusted and
to sicken at the frequency of her complaints,
and the urgency and extravagance of her
requisitions
.
Still, I could not yet desert her
entirely. I saw her frequently, and in
various
ways sought, not merely to evade her
entreaties, but to soothe and alleviate her
distresses
.
To full manhood I had now attained, and it
was thought advisable by my father, that, as I
had nothing else to do, I should employ
myself
in addressing a lady whom he had already
chosen, as worthy to be the consort of so
hopeful
a son. And she was so. Constance
Claiborne
was not merely young, beautiful and
wealthyshe was amiable and accomplished.
Our parents arranged the matter between
them, before either of the parties most
interested
,
knew or suspected any thing of what
was going on. I had as yet heard nothing of
the affair. But that was no objection. It
proved none with me. I was not unwilling,
for many reasons, that the marriage should
take place. It will be sufficient to name one
of these reasons. Though liberal, the
allowance
of money for my own expenditure, which
I received from my father, had, for a long time
past, been inadequate to the wants which my
excesses necessarily occasioned. I had got
largely into debt. I was harrassed by
creditors
;
and had been compelled to resort to
various
improper expedients, to meet my
exigencies
.
My more recent habits rendered a
still further increase of stipend essential, for
though, for some months, I had given my time
chiefly to Emily, I had not yet so entirely
divested myself of my old associates as to
do with less money. My pride too, would
not permit her to want for many things, and I
had contributed, not a little towards the
improvement
of the condition of her family.
It is well perhaps, that, in a chronicle of
crime, almost unvarying, I should not
altogether
overlook those instances of conduct,
which, if not praiseworthy, were, at least, not
criminal. The marriage was therefore
determined
upon. Constance was an obedient
child, and, without an affection existing, she
consented to become my wife. Still, though
making up my determination, without scruple
on the subject, I confess I was not altogether
at ease when my thoughts reverted to the
condition of the poor girl I had dishonored.
But what was that condition. In pecuniary
matters, I could make her better off than
everand, so far as caste was concerned
she could suffer no loss, for she had known
no society. I never thought of the intrinsic
value and necessity of virtue. My
considerations
were all selfish, and tributary to
conventional
estimates. With regard to our
connexion
,
I saw no difficulty in marrying the
heiress
,
and still enjoying, as before, the society
of Emily. Matrimonial fidelity was still less
a subject of concern; and, adjusting, in this
way, the business and relations of the future,
I hurried the arrangements and prepared
assiduously
for the enjoyments of the bridal.
CHAPTER V.
A sense of cautionor it may be of shame
determined me to keep the marriage, as long
as I well could, from the knowledge of the one
being whom it most injured. A few days
before
that assigned for the event, I proceeded
to the place of usual rendezvous. I had not
seen her for several days before; and her looks
indicated sickness and suspicion. The latter
appearance, I did not seem to observe, but
her indisposition called forth my enquiries and
regrets. I still strove to wear the guise of
affection
,
but my words were cold, and my
manner
,
I feel assured, wore all the features of
the most confirmed indifference. You look
unwell, Emily, I observed, putting my arms
around heryou have not been so, have
you?
Can you ask, was her reply, as her eyes
were mournfully riveted upon my own;
could I continue well, and not see you for
three days? alas! Martin, you little know
how long a period in time is three whole days
to me in your absence. Where have you been
have you been sickyou look not as you
are wont to look. You are troubled and
something
afflicts you.
Her manner was tender in the extreme
the suggestion even by herself of
indisposition
as a cause of my absence, seemed to
awaken all her solicitude, and to make her
regret her own implied reproaches.
I have been slightly unwell, Emily, was
my reply, in a tone gravely adapted to indicate
something of continued indisposition; and
the possibility that this was the case, brought
out all her fondness. How like a childa
sweet confiding child she then spoke to me.
With what deep and fervid devotionand,
yet, at the very moment that the accents of
her voice were most touching and tender, I
had begun to hate her. She was in my way
I saw how utterly impossible it was, that,
feeling for me as she did, she could ever
tolerate a connexion with me, shared at the
same time with another.
Butthere is one thing, Martinone
thing of which I would speakand, hear me
patiently, and be not angry, if in what I say, I
may do you injustice and may not have heard
6
rightly. Say, now, that you will not be
angry
with your Emilythat you will forgive her
speech if it seem to call in question your
integrity
,
for, as I live, Martin, I think you
intend me no wrong.
And as she spoke, her hand grasped my
arm convulsively, while one of her own, as
if with a spasmodic effort, wound itself about
my neck. I saw that the time for stern
collision
was at handthat busy tongues had
been about her, and I steeled myself
stubbornly
for the struggle and the strife.
And, what do they say, Emilyand who
are they that say, that which calls for such a
note of preparation? Speak outsay on!
I will, Martinbut look not so upon me.
I cannot bear your frownany thing but
that.
Now thenwhat is said. What would
you have, Emily?
There have been those to my mother,
Martinwho have doubted your love for me,
and, ignorant of how much importance it is to
me now, who say, you are only seeking to
beguile
and to mislead me.
They do me wrong, Emilythey speak
false, believe me, as I live.
I knew it, MartinI knew that they did
you wrong, and I told them so, but they
sneered and laughed, and so they left me.
But, Martinthey will speak to others, when
I shall not be there to defend you, and we
shall both suffer under their suspicions.
She paused here, and her eye sunk under
the penetrating gaze of mine, but suddenly
recovering, and hurrying herself, as if she
feared the loss of that momentary impulse
which then came to sustain hershe
proceeded
I knew that I should suffer from you no
injusticeI could not think it possible that
you could wrong the poor girl, who had
confided
to you so far;but Martindo not smile
at my follya something whispers me I have
not long, not very long, to live, and I would
be your wifeyour married wifebefore the
time comes when my sin shall stand
embodied
before me. Let me have the
peace
the
peace,
Martin, which our lawful union will
bring with it; for now I have none. You have
promised me frequentlysay now that we
shall be married this weeksay on Thursday,
Martinon Thursday next that it shall take
place.
I started as she concluded the sentence, as
if I had been stung with an adder. Thursday
was the day appointed for my marriage with
Constance. Had she heard of this. I fixed
my eyes attentively and searchingly upon her
own; but though filled with tears, they
quailed
not beneath my glance. On the contrary
her gaze was full of intenseness and
expression
.
They conveyed, in dumb language the
touching appeal of her subdued and
apprehensive
,
though seemingly confident and
assured
,
spirit. Disappointment, and the hope
deferred that maketh the heart sick, had worn
her into meagreness. Her cheeks were pale
her look was that of suppressed
wretchedness
,
but these things touched me not. I had
no notion of compliance, and my only thought
was how to break off a connexion that
promised
6*
to be so excessively troublesome. I had
now become completely tired of her, and told
her peremptorily that it was impossible, for a
variety of reasons, to grant her request. She
imploredshe made a thousand appeals to
every supposed impulse and emotion of
manhood
and affection; to my pride, to my honor,
to my love. I was inflexible; and finally, when
she continued to press the matter with a warmth
and earnestness natural to one in her
situation
,
particularly as I had given no reason for
my refusal, I grew brutally stern in my replies.
I repulsed her tendernesses, and peevishly at
length, uttered some threat, I know not what
of absence, or indifference, or anger.
She retreated from me a pace, and
drawing
her hands over her eyes, seemed desirous
of shutting out the presence of a character so
entirely new and unexpected, as I now
appeared
to her. For a moment she preserved this
attitude in silencethen suddenly again
approaching
,
in subdued accents, she spoke as
at first.
Your words and look, Martin, just now
were so strange and unnatural that I was
almost
afraid of you. Do not speak so again
to your Emily, but oh, grant her prayerher
last prayer. I do not pray for myself, for
though I could not live without your affections,
I shall not need them long, but I pray you
to give a name, an honorable name, to the
little innocent of this most precious burthen.
Let it not, if it lives, curse the mother for the
boon of a life which its fellows must despise,
and speak of with scorn and ignominy.
I stood even this appeal. My heart was
steeled within me, and, though I spoke to
her less harshly, I spoke as hypocritically as
ever. She saw through the thin veil which I
had deemed it necessary to throw over my
dishonesty, and a new expression took the
place of tenderness in her features.
It is all true then, as they have said, she
exclaimed passionately. Now, O God, do
I feel my infirmitynow do I know my sin.
And this is the creature I have lovedthis is
the thingwanting in the heart to feel, and
mean enough in soul to utter falsehood and
prevaricatethis is the creature for whom I
have sacrificed my heartfor whom I have
given up, hopelessly and haplessly, my own
soul. Oh, wretched fooloh, miserable, most
miserable folly. Yet think not, and as she
turned upon me, she looked like the Priestess
upon the tripod, influenced with inspiration
Think not, mean traitor, as thou artthink
not to triumph in thy farther seduction. Me
thou hast destroyed,I am thy victim, and I
feel the doom already. But thou shalt go
no farther in thy way. I will seek out this
lady, for whose more attractive person, mine
and my honor and affections, alike, are to be
sacrificed. She shall hear from me all the
truth. She shall know whether it be
compatible
with her honor and happiness, or the
dignity
of her character, to unite herself, in such
bonds with a man who has proved so deadly,
so dishonorable to her sex. And, oh, God
she exclaimed, sinking fervently on her knee
if it shall so happen that I save one such as
I, from such a folly as mine, may it not
expiate
in thy sight, some portion of the sad offence
of which I have been guilty.
She rose firmly and without a tear. Her
eyes were red, her cheeks were burning with
the fever of her whole frame, and she
seemed
,
in all respects, the embodiment of a divine,
a glorious inspiration. I was awedI was
alarmed. I had never before seen her exhibit
any thing like daring or firmness of purpose.
She was now the striking personification of
both. She approached and sought to pass by
me. I seized her hand. She withdrew it
quickly and indignantly.
Begone she exclaimedI scorn, I
despise
you. Think not to keep me back. You
have brought death and shame among my
people in devoting me to both. You shall
pollute me no more. Nay, speak not. No
more falsehood, no more falsehood, for your
own soul's sake. I would not that you should
seem meaner in my sight, than you already
are.
I seized her hand, and retained it by a fierce
grasp.
Emily, I exclaimed, what would you do
why is this? I ask but for delay, give me
but a month, and all will be wellyou shall
then have what you askyou shall then be
satisfied.
Falsefalse! These assurances, sir,
deceive
me not nowthey deceive me no more.
My hope is gone, forever gone, that you will
do me justice. I see through your hypocrisy
I know all your villainy, and Constance
Claiborne shall know it too. Ha! do you
start when her name is but mentioned. Think
you, I know it not allknow I not that you
have been bought with moneythat, vile and
mercenary as you are, you have not only sold
me, and this unborn pledge of your dishonesty
and my dishonor, but you have sold yourself.
Seek not to keep me back. She shall hear it
all from these lips, that thenceafter shall
forever
more be silent.
She struggled to free herself from my grasp,
and endeavored to pass by me, with a
desperate
efforther strength was opposed to mine,
and in the heat of the struggle I forgot that
victory in such a contest would be the
heaviest
shame. Yet, I only sought, at first, to
arrest
her progress. As I live, I had then no
other object beyond. I certainly did not intend
violence, far less further crime. But the fate
was upon me;she persisted in her design,
and in the effort to prevent her passage, I
hurled her to the ground. I paused, in a
deadly stupor, after this. I was no longer a
reasoninga conscious being. She looked
up to me imploringlythe desperate feeling
which heretofore had nerved and
strengthened
her, seemed utterly to have departed. The
tears were in her eyes, and, at that moment,
she would have obeyed as I commanded
she would have yielded to all my requisitions
she would have been my slave. She met
no answering gentleness in my eyes, and with
a choking and vain effort at speech, she
turned
her face despairingly upon the still dewy
grass, and sobbed, as if the strings of her
heart were breaking in unison with each
convulsion
of her breast. At that moment, I know
not what demon possessed me. There was
7
a deada more than customary silence in all
things around me. I felt a fury within me
a clamorous anxiety about my hearta
gnawing
something that would not sleep, and could
not be silent; and, without a thought of what
I was to do, or what had been done, I knelt
down beside her. My eyes wandered wildly
around the forest, but at length, invariably
settled
,
in the end, upon her. There was an
instinct
in all this. She had the look of an
enemy
to the secret and impelling nature within
me, and, without uttering a single word, my
fingers with an infernal gripe, were upon her
throat. She could not now doubt the
desperate
character of my design, yet did she not
strugglebut her eyes, they spoke, and such
a language! A chain which I myself had
thrown about her neckthat neck all
symetry
and whitenesswas in my way. I sought,
but vainly, to tear it apart with my hands, and
could only do sowith my teeth. In stooping
for this, she writhed her head round and
lifted
her lips to mine. I shrunk, as from the
fang of a serpent. They had a worse sting,
at that moment, in my eyes. Mournfully, as
she saw this, she implored my mercy.
Spare, forgive, dearest Martin, I will never
vex you againspare me this time, and I will
be silent. Kill me notkill me notmore
wildly she exclaimed as my grasp became more
painfulI am too young to dieI am too
bad to perish in my sins. Spare mespare
me. I will not accuse youIGod! Oh,
God!and she was deaddead beneath my
hands!
CHAPTER VI.
I breathed notI lived not for a minute.
My senses were gonemy eyes were in the
air, in the water, in the woods, but I dared
not turn them, for an instant, to the still
imploring
glance of that now fixed and terrifying
look of appeal. Still it pursued me, and I
was forced to seeit was impossible that I
could turn from the horrible expressionthe
dreadful glare, which shot from them through
every muscle of my frame. The trees were
hung with eyes that depended from them
like leaves. Eyes looked at me from the
water that gushed by us; and, as in a night
of many stars, the heavens seemed
clustering
with gazing thousands, all bent down
terrifically
upon me. I started to my feet in
desperation; and by a stern impulse I could
not withstand, I pronounced audibly the name
of my crime.
Murder!
Ten thousand echoes gave me back the
sound. Tongues spoke it in every tree, and
roused into something like demoniac
defiance
,
I again shouted it back to them with
the energies of a Stentorthen leaned
eagerly
forth to hear the replication. But this
mood lasted not long. I was a murderer! I
whispered it, as if in terror, to myself. I
desired
some assurance of the truth.
I am a murderer!
Spoken, however low, it still had its echo.
7*
Murderer!was the response of the trees,
which had now tongues, as well as eyes.
The agony grew intolerable, and a lethargic
stupor came to my aid. I approached the
corpse of my victim. Resolutely I
approached
it. How different was the aspect which
her features now bore. She looked forth all
her sweetness, and there was somethingso
I fanciedlike forgiveness on her lips. Was
it I that had defiled so pure an imagewas it
my hand, that, penetrating the sanctuary of
life, had stolen the sacred fire from the altar?
Oh, strange! that man should destroy the
beauty which charmsthe life that cheers
and gladdensthe affection which won and
nourishes him.
Deep in the centre of that forest stood an
ancient rock. It was little known to the
neighborhood, and its discouraging aspect and
rude and difficult access had preserved it
from frequent intrusion. I, however, whom
no sterility could at any time deter, had
explored its recesses, and it now suggested
itself to my mind, as the place most
calculated
to keep the secret of my crime. A large
natural cavity in one of its sides, difficult of
approach, and inscrutable to research,
seemed
to present a natural tomb, and the
suggestion
was immediately seized upon. I took
her in my armsI pressed her to my heart
but in that pressure I maddened. I had not
yet destroyed, in her death, the distinct
principle
of life which she carried within her. I
felt the slight but certain motion of her child
of my childstruggling as it were for
freedom
.
I closed my eyesI suppressed the
horrible thoughts which were crowding upon
my brain, and hurrying on my way, sought out
the cavity assigned for her repose. But a
single plunge, and she was gone from sight,
from reach. The rock was silent as the grave
it had no echoesfor, at that place and
moment
,
I had no speech.
Will it be believed, the stride I had taken in
crime, contributed largely to the sense of my
own importance. I had never before doubted
my capacity for evilbut I now feltfor I
had realizedI had exercisedthis capacity.
There is something elevatingsomething
attractive
to the human brute, in being a
destroyer
.
It was so with me. There was an
increased vigor in my framethere was new
strength and elasticity in my treadI feel
assured
that there was a loftier, a manlier
expression
in my look and manner. But, all was
not so in my thought. There every thing
was in uproar. There was a strange
incoherence
,
an insane recklessness about my heart,
where, if I may so phrase it, the spirit
seemed
prone to wandering about precipices and
places of dread and danger. I kept
continually
repeating to myself, the name of my crime.
I caught myself muttering over and over the
word Murder, and that, too, coupled with
my own name. Murderer, and Martin
Faber, seemed ever to my imagination the
burden of a melody; and its music, laden with
never ceasing echoes, heard by my own ears,
was forever on my own lips.
CHAPTER VII.
I left the rock, slowly and frequently
looking behind me. Sometimes my fancies
confirmed to my sight the phantom of the
murdered
girl, issuing from the gaping aperture,
and with waving arms, threatening and
denouncing
me. But I sternly put down these weak
intruders. Though the first crime, of so deep
a dye, which I had ever committed, I felt that
the thoughts and feelings which came with
the act, had been long familiar to my mind.
The professional assassin could hardly look
upon his last murder, with more composure,
than I now surveyed the circumstances of my
first. I was indeed a veteran, and in a past
condition of society, I should have been a
hero
the
savior or the destroyer of a nation.
To be precipitate, was to be weak; so
thought I even in that moment of fearful
circumstances
.
I went back with all possible
composure to the spot in which the crime had
been committed. I examined the spot
carefully
took
with my eye the bearing and
distances
of all the surrounding objects in their
connexion with the immediate spot on which
the deed had been done. In this
examination
,
I found the pocket handkerchief of
Emily
,
with her name written in Indian ink upon
it. I carefully cut it into shreds, dividing
each particular letter, with my pen-knife, and
distributing the several pieces at slow
intervals
upon the winds. Where our feet
together
had pressed the sands, with a handful of
brush, I obliterated the traces; and in the
performance
of this task, I drew off my own
shoes, leaving, only, as I proceeded, the
impression
of a naked foot. While thus
engaged
,
I perceived for the first time, that I had
lost a rich, and large cameo, from my bosom.
The loss gave me no little concern, for, apart
from the fact of its being generally known for
mine, the intials of my name were engraven
on the gold setting. How and where had it
been lost. This was all important, and with
indefatigable industry, I examined the grass
and every spot of ground which I had gone
over in the recent events. But in vainit was
not to be found, and with a feeling of
uneasiness
not
to describe my anxiety by a stronger
epithetI proceeded on my way home.
The poverty of Emily's family; the
insulated
position which they held in society; their
inability to press an inquirywere all so many
safeguards and securities in my favor. There
was some little stir, it is truebut I had so
arranged matters that I passed unsuspected.
The inquiry was confined to the particular
part of country in which she resideda
lonely
and almost uninhabited regionand, but a
distant rumor of the crime reached our village
in which, the connexion existing between us
was almost entirely unknown. The family
had but few claims upon society, and but
little
interest was excited by their loss. In a
little while all inquiry ceased; and with a
random and general conclusion that she had
fallen into the river, the thought of Emily
Andrews
gradually passed from the memories of
those who had known her.
8
CHAPTER VIII.
The night came, appointed for my marriage
with the beautiful and wealthy Constance
Claiborne. Attended by William Harding,
who, strange to say, in spite of the manifest
and radical differences of character existing
between us, was yet my principal companion,
I was punctual to the hour of appointment.
Every preparation had been made by which
the ceremony should be attractive. A large
company had been assembled. Lights in
profusion
rich
dressesgayly dressed and
decorated
apartments, and the most various
music
,
indicated the spirit of joy and perfect
harmony with which our mutual families
contemplated
our union. I have already said,
the bride was beautiful. Words cannot
convey an idea of her beauty. She was
emphatically a thing of light and love
Which seen, becomes a part of sight.
In grace, one knew not with what, save
herself
,
to institute a comparison. In
expression
,
there were volumes of romantic, and
interesting
poetry, embodied in each feature of
her face; and the steel of my affections, stern
as it was, wherever she turned, even as the
dutiful
needle to the pole, turned intuitively
along with her. Such was the maiden,so
much after the make and mould of heaven,
whom a cruel destiny was about to link with
one formed in spirit after the fashion of hell.
The ceremony was begun. We stood up
with linked hands at the altar. The priest
went on with his formula. The bride's hand
trembled in mine, and her eyes were
commercing
only with the richly carpeted floor. I
was about to answer the question which
should have made us one, when a cold wind
seemed to encircle my body. My bones
were numbed, and a freezing chill went
through my whole system. My tongue
refused
its office, and, instinctively, as it were,
bending to the opposite quarter of the
apartment
,
my eyes fell upon a guest whom none
had invited. There, palpable as when I had
last seen her, stood the form of Emily
Andrews
.
A pale and melancholy picture, and
full of a terrible reproach. I was dumb, and
for a moment, had eyes only for her. She
was motionless, as when I had borne her to
the unhallowed grave in which she did not
rest. I felt that all eyes were upon methe
bride's hand was slowly withdrawn from mine,
and that motion restored me. Mine were
terrible
energies. I seized her hand with a
strong effort, and with a voice of the sternest
emphasis, my eye firmly fixed upon the
obtrusive
phantom, I gave the required
affirmative
.
With the word, the figure was gone.
I had conquered. You will tell me, as
philosophers
have long since told us, that this was
all the work of imaginationa diseased and
excited fancy, and in this you are probably
right. But what of that? Is it less a matter
of supernatural contrivance, that one's own
spirit should be made to conjure up the
spectres
which haunt and harrow it, than that the
8*
dead should actually be made to embody
themselves, as in life, for the same providence?
The warning sound that chatters in my ear
of approaching death may be, in fact,
unuttered
;
but if my spirit, by an overruling fate, is
calculated for the inception of such a sound,
shall we hold it as less the work of a
superior
agency? Is it less an omen for that?
This was not all. At midnight, as I
approached
my chamber, the same ghastly
spectre stood at the door as if to guard it
against my entrance. For a moment I
paused
and faltered; but thought came to my
relief
.
I knew that the energies of soul,
immortal
and from the highest as they are,
were paramount, and I advanced. I stretched
forth my hand to the key, and all was
vacancy
again before me. If my fancies
conceived
the ghost, my own energies were adequate
to its control. In this I had achieved a new
conquest, and my pride was proportionately
increased and strengthened. I was thus taught
how much was in my own power, in making
even destiny subservient to my will!
CHAPTER IX.
I need not say that no happiness awaited
me in my marriage. Still less is it necessary
that I should tell you of the small amount of
happiness that fell to the lot of my wife. I
did not ill-treat herthat is to say, I employed
neither blows nor violence; but I was a
wretched discontent, and when I say this I
have said all. She suffered with patience,
however, and I sometimes found it
impossible
,
and always difficult, to drive her beyond
the boundary of yielding and forgiving
humility
.
She loved me not from the first, and
only became my bride from the absence of
sufficient firmness of character, to resist the
command. The discovery of this fact, which
I soon made, offended my pride. I did not
distrust, howeverI hated her; and, with a
strange perversity of character, which, let
philosophers
account for as they maywhen I
found that she could love, and that feelings
were engendered in her bosom for another,
hostile to her affection for me, though not at
variance with her dutiesI encouraged their
growth. I nursed their developement. I
stimulated
their exercise; and strove, would you
believe it, to make her the instrument of my own
dishonor. But her sense of pride and
propriety
was greater than mine. Though conscious
that her heart was another's, she unerringly held
her faith to her husband, and my anger and
dislike
were exaggerated, when I discovered that
my vice, even when allied to and assisted by
her own feelings, could gain no ascendancy
over her virtue.
She was won by the gentleness, the talent,
the high character of my old friend, William
Harding. She listened to his language with
unreluctant and unconcealed pleasure. She
delighted in his society; and with a feeling
which she had never dared to name to herself,
she gave him a preference, in every thought,
in every emotion of her being. Norboy as
he wassensitive and easily wrought upon
by respect and kindnesswas he at all
insensible
to her regards. He became, as an
acquaintance, almost an inmate of our house.
He was always with usand with the
openness
of heart common to such a character, he
unreservedly sought for the society of
Constance
.
I soon discovered their mutual
propensities
,
for, at an early period, I had learned,
with singular felicity, to analyze character.
At first, and while she was yet a charming
creation in my sight, and before I had learned to
disregard and be indifferent to the admiration
which she excited in others, this predilection
gave me not a little concern. I was for a
season the victim of a jealous doubtnot so
much the result of a fear of offended honor,
as of a weak pride and vanity, that was vexed
at the preference given to him over myself, in
the bosom of one, I strove to have exclusively
my own. But this feeling went with the
season
.
I grew indifferent at first, then pleased
with their association, and finally it became
an object with me, so to encourage it, as to
give me a sufficient excuse and opportunity
for a dreadful and overwhelming revenge.
But they were both honesthonest as I had
never beenas I never expected man or
woman
to have been! Twining and
intermingling
,
hourly in spirit, the most jealous
scrutiny
,
the most bitter hate and hostility, could
never detect the slightest feature of
impropriety
in their conduct. Many were the modes
which I chose to stimulate their passionsto
influence their desiresto put their spirits
into flame; and many were the opportunities
with which I sought, in hurrying them to
crime, to provide myself with victims. They
went through the ordeal like angelswithout
one speck of earth; and pining with
suppressed
and strong affections, I beheld the
cheek of Constance grow paler, day by day,
and saw, at every visitthe increased
wildness
of lookthe still exaggerated emotions
struggling for utterance and life, in the bosom
of the young and susceptible Harding.

CHAPTER X.
Some months had now elapsed since our
marriage; and in this time, my house and
young wife had lost most of their attractions.
My favorite habit, and one which contributed
not a little to my mood of sternness, was to
take long walks into the neighboring country;
and with my fowling-piece on my shoulder as
apologetic for my idle wanderings, the
neighboring
forests for ten or fifteen miles round,
soon became familiar to my survey.
Sometimes
,
on these occasions, Harding would
become
my companion; and as he was highly
contemplative in character, his presence did
not at all interfere with the gloominess of my
mood. It was on one of these occasions,
while traversing a dense wood, thickly sown
with undergrowth, and penetrable with
difficulty
,
that we sat down together upon the
trunk of a fallen tree, and fell into
conversation
.
Our dialogue was prompted by the
circumstances
of our situation, and
unconsciously
I remarked
Harding, this is just such a spot, which
one would choose in which to commit a
murder
!
Horrible! was his reply, what could
put such a thought into your head? This, is
just the spot now which I should choose for
the inception of a divine poem. The awful
stillnessthe solemn gloomthe singular and
sweet monotony of sound, coming from the
breeze through the bending tree tops, all
seem well calculated to beget fine thoughts,
daring fanciesbold and striking emotions.
You talk of taking life, as if it were the
crowning crimeit appears to me an error of
society by which the existence of a being,
limited
to a duration of years, is invested with so
much importance. A few years lopt from the
life of an individual is certainly no such loss,
shortening as it must, so many of his cares
and troubles; and the true standard by which
we should determine upon a deed, is the amount
of good or evil which it may confer upon the
person or persons immediately interested.
That is not the standard, was his reply
since that would be making a reference to
varying and improper tribunals, to determine
upon principles which should be even and
immutable
.
But, even by such a standard,
Martin, it would be a crime of the most
horrible
complexion, for, leave the choice to the
one you seek to murder, and he will submit,
in most cases, to the loss of all his worldly
possessions, and even of his liberty, in
preference
to the loss of life.
What would you say, William if you
knew I had been guilty of this crime?
Say! he exclaimed, as his eyes shot
forth an expression of the deepest horror
say!I could say nothingI could never
look upon you again.
I looked at him with close attention for a
moment, then, placing my hands upon his
shoulder with a deliberation which was
significant
of the deepest madness, I spoke:
Lookyou shall look upon me again. I
9*
have been guilty of this same crime of taking
life. I have been, and am, a murderer.
He sprung upon his feet with undisguised
horror. His face was ashen palehis lips
were parted in affright; and while I held one
of his hands, the other involuntarily was
passed
over, entirely concealing his eyes. What
prompted me to the narration I know not. I
could not resist the impulseI was compelled
to speak. It was my fate. I described my
crimeI dwelt upon all its particulars; but
with a caution, strangely inconsistent with the
open confidence I had manifested, I changed
the name of the victimI varied the period,
and falsified, in my narrative, all the localities
of the crime; concluding with describing her
place of burial beneath a tree, in a certain
ground which was immediately contiguous,
and well known to us both.
He heard me out with wonder and
astonishment
.
His terror shook his frame as with
an ague, and at the conclusion he tried to
laugh, and his teeth chattered in the effort.
It is but a story, he said chokingly, a
horrible
story, Martin, and why do you tell it me?
I almost thought it true from the earnest
manner
in which you narrated it.
It is true, Williamtrue as you now
stand before me. You doubt, I will swear
Oh, swear notI would rather not believe
yousay no more, I pray youtell me no
more.
With a studied desperationa malignant
pleasure, increasing in due proportion with the
degree of mental torture which he appeared
to undergo, I went again over the whole story
as I had before told ittaking care that my
description of each particular should be made
as vivid as the solemn and bold truth
certainly
made it.
I am a murderer! William Harding!
May God forgive you, Martinbut why
have you told me thiswould you murder
me, Martin? Have I done any thing to offend
you?
His excessive nervousness, at length, grew
painful, even to myself. Nay, fear not, I
would not harm you, William, for the world.
I would rather serve and save you. But keep
my secretI have told it you in confidence,
and you will not betray me.
Horrible confidence! was his only reply,
as we took our way from the forest.
CHAPTER XI.
Several days had passed since this
conference
,
and, contrary to his custom, Harding, in
all this time, had kept out of my sight. His
absence was felt by both Constance and
myself
.
He had been, of late, almost the only
companion known to either of us. Why I
liked him I knew not. His virtues were
many, and virtues were, at no time, a subject
of my admiration. That he was loved by
Constance, I had no question; that he loved
her I felt equally certainbut it was the
passion
of an angel on the part of both; and it
may be that knowing the torture which it
brought with it to both of them, my malignant
spirit found pleasure in bringing them
together
.
It was not a charitable mood, I am
satisfied
,
that made me solicitous that he should
be as much as possible an inmate of my
dwelling.
He came at last, and I was struck with his
appearance. The change for the worse was
dreadfully obvious. He looked like one, who
had been for many nights without sleep. He
was pale, nervous in the last degree, and
awfully
haggard.
I am miserable, said he, since you
breathed that accursed story in my ears.
Tell me, I conjure you, Martin, as you value
my quiet, that you but jested with methat
the whole affair was but a fabricationa
fetch of the nightmarea mere vision of the
fancy.
Will it be believed, that having thus an
opportunity
,
even then, of undoing the impression
I had created, I took no advantage of it. I
persisted in the storyI was impelled to do
so, and could not forbear. There was an
impulse
that mastered the willthat defied the
cooler judgmentthat led me waywardly, as
it thought proper. You have read that strange
poem of Coleridge, in which the Auncient
Marinere is made, whether he will or no, and
in spite of every obstacle, to thrust his terrible
narrative into the ears of the unwilling listener.
It was so with me; but though I was thus
compelled to denounce my crime, the will had
still some exercise, and I made use of it for my
security. I changed the particulars so
materially
from the facts, as they really were, that
inquiry must only have resulted in my
acquittal
.
The state of mind under which Harding
labored, was of melancholy consequence, to
him, at least, if not to me. Sad and
disappointed
,
he left me without a word, and for
some days more I saw him not. At length he
came to me looking worse than ever.
I shall go mad, Faber, with this infernal
secret. It keeps me awake all night. It fills
my chamber with spectres. I am haunted
with the presence of the girl, you accuse
yourself
of having murdered.
Go towill you be a child all your life.
Why should she haunt you?it is not you
who have murdered hershe does not trouble
me.
Nevertheless, she does. She calls upon
me to bring you to justice. I awake and she
is muttering in my ears. She imploresshe
threatensshe stands by my bed side in the
darknessshe shakes the curtainsI hear
the rustling of her garmentsI hear her
words; and when I seek to sleep, her cries
of Murder,! Murder! Murder! are shouted,
and ring through all my senses, as the sound
of a sullen, swinging bell in the wilderness.
Save me, Martinfrom this visionsave me
from the consequence of your own imprudence
in telling me this story. Assure me that it is
untrue, or I feel that I shall be unable to keep
the secret. It is like a millstone around my
neckit makes a hell within my heart.
What! and would you betray mewould
you bring me to punishment, for an offence
which I have told you was involuntary, and
which I unconsciously committed? Your
sense of honor, apart from your feeling of
10
friendship, alone, should be sufficient to
restrain
you. I cannot believe that you would
violate your pledgethat you can betray
the confidence reposed in you.
Silenced, but not satisfied, and far more
miserable than ever, the poor youth, whose
nerves were daily become more and more
unsteady
and sensitive under these exciting
influences
,
went away;but the next day, he
came againhis look was fixed and resolute,
and an air of desperate decision marked
every
feature.
I am about to go to the Justice, Martin, to
reveal all this story, precisely as you have
told it to meI cannot bear a continuance of
life, haunted as I have been, by innumerable
terrors, ever since I heard it. But last night,
I heard the distinct denunciations of the
murdered
girl, couched in the strongest language,
emphatically uttered in my ears. The whole
scene was before me, and the horrors of the
damned, could not exceed those which
encompassed
my spirit. I fled from the chamber
from the house. In the woods I have passed
the whole night in the deepest prayer. My
determination is the result of the soundest
conviction of its necessity. I can keep your
secret no longer.
I paused for a moment, and having
prepared
myself for all difficulties by a
consideration
of all the circumstances, I simply bade
himGo thenif he was determined upon
the betrayal of his friend and the forfeiture of
his honor.
Reproach me not thus, Martinwas his
reply. Forgive me, but I must do so. I
must either disclose all or commit
self-murder
.
I cannot keep within my bosom that
which makes it an tnawhich keeps it
forever
in flame and explosion. Forgive
forgive
me! Thus speaking, he rushed from
my presence.
CHAPTER XII.
I was cited before the Justice, and the
testimony
of William Harding delivered with
the most circumstantial minuteness, was taken
down in my presence. Never did I see a
more striking instance of conscience
struggling
with feelingnever had I conceived of
so complete a conquest of one over the other.
I denied all. I denied that I had ever made
him such a statementthat we had ever
had any such conversation; and with the
coolness
and composure of veteran crime,
wondered
at the marvellous insanity of his
representations
.
He was dumb, he looked
absolutely
terrified. Of course, however, in such
an examination, my own statements were
unavailing
;
and his were to be sustained by a
reference to the localities and such of the
details
which he had made, as might ostensibly
contribute to its sustenance or overthrow.
Search was made under the tree where my
victim was alledged to have been buried.
The earth appeared never to have been
disturbed
from the creation  upon digging,
nothing
was found. So, with all other particulars.
Harding's representations were confuted. He
was regarded by all as a malignant wretch,
who envied the felicity, and sought to sting
the hand of him who had cherished and
befriended
him. The public regard feel away
from him, and he was universally avoided. I
affected to consider him the victim of
momentary
hallucination,
and the christian charity
thus manifested, became the admiration of all.
I almost dreaded that I should be deified
made a deacon in life, and a saint after death.
Poor Harding sunk silently to his den.
Sensitively alive to public opinion, as well as
private regard, his mind reeled to and fro, like
a storm troubled vessel, beneath a shock so
terrible and unexpected. He had lived upon
the breath of famehe was jealous of high
reputationhe was tremblingly alive to those
very regards of the multitude, which were
now succeeded by their scorn and hisses.
What a blow had I given himbut he was
not yet to escape me. I suffered a day or
two to elapse, and then sought him out in his
chamber. I entered, and looked upon him
for several minutes unobserved. His head
was between his hands, and his chin rested
upon the table. His air was that of the most
woful
abandon
. The nature of his feelings
might be inferred, along with his personal
appearance
,
from the nature of the companions
beside, and the general condition of things
around him. One boot was thrown off, and
lay upon the floorthe other, as if he had
grown incapable of further effort, was
permitted
to remain upon his foot. The mirror
lay in the smallest pieces about the room;
the contemplation of his own features,
blasted
as they had been with the shame of his
situation, having prompted him, as he came
from the place of trial, to dash his hand through
it. On the table, and on each side of him, lay
strangely associatedhis bible and his
pistols
.
He had been about to refer to one or to
the other of them for consolation. It was in
this situation, that I found him out. I brought
increased tortureswhile the people, who
saw and wondered, gave me credit for
christian
benevolence. How many virtues would
put on the most atrocious features, could
their true motives be pursued through the
hive of venomous purposes that so frequently
swarm and occupy the secret cells and
caverns
of the human heart!
He saw me at length, and, as if the
associations
which my presence had called up, were
too terrible for contemplation, he buried his
head in his hands, and again thrust them on
the table. As I approached, however, he
started from this positiona mood entirely
new, appeared to seize upon him, and
snatching
the pistol which lay before him upon the
table, he rushed to meet me. He placed it
upon my bosom, and deliberately cocked it,
placing his finger at the same moment upon
the trigger. A glare of hellish desperation,
flowed out from his eyes, as with words that
seemed rather shrieked than articulated, he
exclaimed
And what is there that keeps me
from destroying you? What should stay my
handwhat should interpose to protect you
from my just revengewhat should keep you
from the retributive wrath, which you have
roused into fury?
I made no movementprecipitation, or any
act or gesture, on my part, at that moment,
would have been instant death. He would
have felt his superiority. I maintained my
position, and without raising a finger, I
replied
with the utmost deliberation:
What should keep you from taking my
life! What a question! Would you be
answered
?Your
own fears.You know that I
would haunt you.
The pistol dropped from his hands, and he
trembled all over. I proceeded.
You should have no peaceno moment of
repose secure from my intrusionno single
hour you should call your own. I should link
myself to you, as Mezentius' dead, to his
condemned
and living victim. I would come
between
you and your dearest joys, nor depart
for a solitary moment from a share in all the
unavoidable duties and performances of life.
We should sit, side by side, at the same table
sleep in the same couch,dwell in the same
dwelling. Would you rise to speak in the
council, I should prompt your wordsI should
guide your action. Would you travel, I would
mount the box and impel in the direction of
my caprice. Would you love, I would figure
in your courtshipgo between yourself and
mistress, and assist in your bridal. Your own
wife should not have one half of the
communion
I should enjoy with you!
He was paralyzed with his agony.
Terrible man! he exclaimed, What
would you do with me; why am I made
your victimwhy do you persecute me?
I have not wronged; I have not sought to
wrong you. You, on the contrary, have
destroyed
me, and yet would pursue me further.
You have been my evil genius.
I know itI deplore it!
You deplore it! Horrible mockery! How
shall I believe your speech after what has
happened. Why deny the story, yourself
poured into my ears as the truth.
It was the truth!
Yet you swore it was false!
Life is sweetlife is necessary, if not to
human joys, at least, to the opportunities of
human repentance. Would you have me give
myself to an ignominious death upon the
scaffold
disgracing
my family, dishonoring
myself
,
and dooming all who shared in my
communion
to a kindred dishonor with myself?
Why then did you tell me of this crime?
I could not help it. The impulse was
native
and involuntary, and I could not disobey
it. It would not be resisted. It burned in
my bosom as it has done in yours, and, until
I had revealed it, I could hope for no relief.
11
Dreadful alternative! Hear me, Martin
Faberhear me and pity me. You know my
historyyou know my hopesmy
pretensions
my
ambition. You know that for
years, from my boyhood up, in despite of
poverty
,
and the want of friends and relatives, I
have been contending for gloryfor a name.
You know that the little world in which we
live, had begun to be friendly to my
aspirations
that
they looked on my progress with
sympathy and encouragementthat they
pointed to me as one likely to do them honor
to confer a name upon my country as well as
upon myself. You know that for years, in
solitude
,
and throughout the long hours of the
dark and wintery night, I have pursued my
solitary toil for these objects. That I have
shrunk from the society that has been wooing
methat I have denied myself all the
enjoyments
which are the life of other menthat I
have, in short, been sacrificing the present for
the future existencethe undying memory of
greatness, which it had been my hope, to leave
behind me. This you knewthis you know.
In one hour, youwithout an objectto
satisfy
a wanton capriceyou have overthrown all
these hopesyou have made all these labors
valuelessyou have destroyed me. Those
who loved, hate methose who admired,
contemn
those
who praised, now curse and
denounce
me as a wanton and malicious enemy,
seeking the destruction of my friend! I am not
only an exile from my speciesI am
banished
from that which has been the life-blood of
my beingthe possession of a goodly, of a
mighty name! I have no further use in life.
All is trueyou have said but the truth.
I am conscious of it all.
Oh, speak not, I conjure youI need not
your assurances in my confirmation. I do not
ask your voice. Hear me in what I shall say,
and if you can, heal as far as you may heal,
the wounds you have inflicted.
Speak on!
I will seek to reconcile myself to the
condition
to
the exile to which you have driven
me. I will struggle to give up the high hopes
which have prompted and cheered me, through
the unalleviated and unlighted labors of my
lifeI will struggle to benothing! All I ask
is that you should give me peacepermit me
to sleep once more. Say that you have not
committed the crime, of which you have
accused
yourself. Give me this assurance, and
free me from this gibbering and always
present
spectre, that, roused for ever by my
fancies
,
refuses to be gone !
How easy to have granted this request ! How
impossible, indeed, would it appear, to have
refused an appeal, urged under such
circumstances
.
But I did refuse  I reiterated the
story of my crime, as I had uttered it before,
without any variation, and the nervously
susceptible
youth sunk down before me, in
despair
,
upon the floor. In a moment, however,
he arose, and  smile was upon his lips.
There was a fearful energy in his eye, which
had never marked it before, and which it
surprised
me not a little to survey. With a strong
effort, he approached me.
I will be no longer a child  I will shake off
this fever of feeling which is destroying me.
11*
I will conquer these fanciesI will not be
their slave. Shall I possess a mind, so
soaring
and absolute, to bow down to the tyrant of
my own imaginings? I will live for better
things. I will make an effort!
I applauded his determination, and
persuaded
him to go with me, as before, to my
residence
.
This, though good policy with me,
was the height of bad policy with him. The
world looked upon me as the most forgiving
and foolishly weak philanthropista
benevolent
creation of the very finest water. The
readiness with which Harding again sought
my hospitality, after his charges against me,
was, of course, still further in evidence, against
the honesty of his intentions. They
looked
upon his depravity as of the most
heinous
character, and numberless were the
warnings
which I hourly received, of the thousand
stings which theso-calledserpent was
treasuring up for my bosom. But, I affected
to think differently. I put all in his conduct
down to a momentary aberration of intellect,
and urged the beauty and propriety of christian
forgiveness. Was I not of a most saint-like
temper? They thought so.
CHAPTER XIII.
It is strange, that, with my extended and
perfect knowledge of human character, and
my great love of mental and moral analysis,
I should have suffered myself to be taken in
by these external shows on the part of my
victim. Strange, that so suddenso
unlooked
for, an alteration from his wonted habit had
not aroused my jealousymy suspicion of
some hidden motive. But, my blindness was
a part of my fate, or, how should it have been
that a creature so weak, so utterly dependent
as Harding had ever been, should have
deceived
a spirit so lynx-eyed as mine. Led to
consider
him too greatly the victim of the nervous
irritability, boy which, indeed, his every action
and impulse was distinguished, I had not
looked
for the exercise, in his mind, of any of that
kind of energy, which would carry him
undeviatingly
and perseveringly to the attainment of
any remote or difficult object, or to the
accomplishment
of a far and foreign purpose. I had
neglected entirely to allow for the stimulating
properties of a defeat, to a mind which had
only lived for a single object. I had refused to
count upon the decision of character, which,
might, by probability, arise in a mind, however
in all other respects, variable and vascillating,
when concentrating itself upon the attainment
of a single end, and that, too, of a kind, so
absorbing
,
so all impelling as the attainment of
fame. I did not recollect that Harding had
himself acknowledged the existence of one
only passion, in his bosom; or, I should have
seen that his present change of manner, was but
a thin veil disguising and concealing some
ulterior
project, subservient to the leading
passion
of his spirit. I failed, therefore,fool that
I wasto perceive the occult design, which
of a sudden had so completely altered all the
obvious characteristics of my companionhis
habits, his temper, and his hopes. Folly to
suppose, that with the loss of public
estimation
,
he would be content with life unless with
a desperate effort to regain his position. And
how could he regain that position? How, but
by establishing my guilt, and his innocence of
all malevolent intention. And such was his
design. Assured, as he now was, that I
was in truth a criminalthat I had committed
the murder of which I had accused myself,
and that I had only so varied the statement of
its particulars as to mislead and defeat enquiry
and looking forward to the one single
object
,that
of restoring himself to the popular
regards of which I had deprived himhe was
determined, of himself, to establish my crime
to trace the story from the very imperfect data
I had myself given him, and by perpetual
associations
with myself, and a close
examination
into my moral make, to find out the
materials
of evidence which should substantiate
his now defeated accusations. How blind was
I not to have perceived his objectnot to see
through his unaccustomed artifices! The
geniusthe gigantic genius of his mind, will
be best comprehended from this curious and
great undertaking, and from the ingenuity and
indefatigable industry with which he pursued
it. Nor, from this fact, alone, but coupled, as
under existing circumstances was the pursuit
adopted, his strength of character and
firmness
of mind, are of the most wonderful
description
.
The task was attended with an
association
,
which, for a protracted period of
time, still further exposed him to the scornful
execrations and indignation of those, for whose
good opinion, alone, he was voluntarily about
to undergo all this additional load of obloquy.
Under these aspects the effort was a
high-souled
and sublime one, and furnished one of
the best proofs of the moral elevation of his
genius. I regard it now, when too late to
arrest its exercise and progress, with a
sentiment
little short of wonder and admiration.
All these occurrences, had, of course, been
made known to my wife; and shocked and
terrified as she had beentorn and distracted
between a sense of duty to myself, and a
feeling
of deep, but unexpressed regard for my
accuserwhen, for the first time after the
trial, I brought him to the house, with a highly
proper spiritseeing the affair as she had seen
itshe declined making her appearance. I
insisted
upon it:
How can you require such a thing? was
her very natural inquiry. Whatever may
have been his motive, has he not sought your
life. Has he not brought a foul and false
accusation
against you, making you a criminal
of the darkest dye?
Look at me, Constance, I said in reply,
as I took one of her hands in mineI am
the criminalI committed the crime he
charged
upon me, and which I myself had revealed
12
to him. His accusation, so far as he was
concerned, was neither foul nor false!
And wherefore did I tell her this? Why
should I have multiplied the evidence against
mewhy put myself at the mercy of another?
It might be enough to say that I did not fear
that Constance would betray me. As she
was a pure and delicate woman, her love for
himtreasured up in secret, and a source of
trembling and self-reproach, as I knew it must
be, to her heartwas my sufficient security.
She would not have linked her testimony with
his, however she might have hated me and
loved him, fearing that her motives might be
subject to the suspicion of others, as she
herself
would have suspected them. This
consideration
would have left me without fear, in
that quarter, but this was not a consideration
with me, in telling her the story. I could not
refrain from telling itin spite of myself I was
compelled to do soit was my fate.
I shall not attempt to describe her horror.
She was dumb, and in silence descended with
me to the apartment in which Harding had
been left. To him this was a moment of
fearful
ordeal. The woman he loved, though
hopelessly, he had struck, through her husband.
He was not to know that I had most
effectually
acquitted him, to her, of the offence, for
which he anticipated her scorn and hatred.
His anxiety and wretchedness were again
manifest until she relieved him, as with a
boldness of spirit which I had never before
seen her manifest, she walked forward, took
his hand, and welcomed him as if nothing had
happened. He looked first to me, then to her
and silently, with a tearful eye, and frame
violently
agitated, he carried her hand to his lips.
She retreated, and was deeply confused by
this act. I saw her inmost soul, at that
moment
in her face. Why had she not loved
me as she loved him? Why, oh, why?
That night, in my chamber, I said to her
You love this youthspeak notI would
not have you deny it. I will tell you more
would you know it?he loves you too, and
there are few persons in the world more
deserving
the love of one another. Were I dead
to-morrow you would most probably make the
discovery, and
Oh, Martin Faber, I see not why you should
torment me in this manner. For heaven's
sake, let me have peace. Make not all
miserable
about you; or, if you are bent on making
me so, let not your malice exercise itself on
this unhappy youth, whose life you have
already
embittered, whose prospects you have
blightedand to whom every hour of
association
with yourself, must work additional evil.
Persuade him, for the repose of all, to leave
the country.
Would you fly with him! Beware,
woman
!
Think not to deceive meI see into
your heart, and understand all its sinuosities.
Look that your interest in this enthusiast gets
not the better of your duty.
She turned her head upon the pillow, and
sobbed
bitterly:yet, how wantonly had I uttered
these reproaches. The angels were not more
innocent in spirit than was she at that moment
when I had inflicted upon her the tortures of
the damned.

CHAPTER XIV.
I am now rather to narrate the labors of
another
than of myself, and to record the
progress
of Harding in the newly assumed duties
of his life, of which, to their termination, I had
little, if any suspicion.
In accordance with his design, and in this
respect, my own habits and disposition favored
him largely, he was with me at all hourswe
were inseparable. He pretended a taste for
gunning, and though a poor sportsman,
provided
with the usual accoutrements, he would
sally forth with me, day after day, in the
pursuit
of the game, in which the neighboring
country was plentifully supplied. Day by
day, at all hours, in all places, we were still
together, and seemingly in the same pursuit;
yet, did we not always hunt. We chose fine
ramblespleasant and devious windings of
country, secluded roads, hills and dales and
deep forests, in which a moody and reflective
spirit might well indulge in its favorite
fancies
.
Of this make were we both. To-day
we were in one directionto-morrow in
another
,
until the neighboring world and woods,
for an extent in some quarters of twenty miles,
became familiar to us in our excursions. I was
struck with Harding's new habit of
observation
.
In our rambles before he had seen,
or appeared to see, nothing. Now nothing
escaped his notice and attention. Tree and
stumphill and valewood and waterall
grew familiar, and a subject of large and
narrow
examination. He seemed particularly
solicitous
of the true relations of thingsof
parallel
distancesobjects of comparative size,
and the dependencies of a group, in the
compass
of his survey. Having great fondness
for landscape drawing and some skill in the
art, I put these peculiarities down to the
account
of this propensity, and gave myself no
concern about it; but not unfrequently,
turning
suddenly, would I detect the fixed gaze of
his eye, fastened inquiringly upon my own.
On such occasions he would turn aside with
a degree of confusion, which, did not,
however
,
provoke my suspicions. There was no
object in these wanderings that seemed too
humble for his survey. He peered into every
cup of the hillsinto hollow treesgroped
his way through the most thickly spread and
seemingly impervious undergrowth, and
suffered
no fatigue, and shrunk back from no
difficulty
.
Having hit upon a new spot, which
looked impervious or dark, he would, before
its examination, closely watch my progress
the direction which I took and the peculiar
expression of my face. These practices were
not unseen by me then, but I regarded them
as having no objectI was certainly blind to
their true one. It is only now that the
mystery
of his mind is unveiledthat his
new-born
daring is accounted forthat he now
appears
the rational and strong spirit I had not
then regarded him.
We had now, in these rambles, taken, with
the exception of a single one, every possible
route, leading into the neighboring country.
Bold and daring as I was, I had always
avoided the path which led to the little islet
and the scenes of my crime, though, certainly
without exception, the most beautiful and
attractive
among them. This had not escaped
his attentionthough he had so contrived it,
as not to appear to have a care or even to be
conscious, what route we were to pursue. It
now happened, however, that we were called
upon to retread spots which had grown
familiar
,
and more than once my companion would
exclaim
Have we not been here beforecan we
not take some new direction?
Still I avoided the route too well known to
me, and still he had not ventured to propose
taking it. He would not alarm me by a
suggestion
,
though one which would have been
so perfectly natural. He took another mode
to effect his purpose, and one day, just as we
were about to pass the little hollow in the
woods, which led directly upon the path I so
much wished to avoid, he saw, or pretended
to see, some game upon which to exercise his
skill, and, without saying more, he darted into
the avenue. I was compelled to follow, and,
slowly, and with feelings I was ashamed to
possess, but could not control, I prepared to
call up the whole history of crime and terror,
already sufficiently vivid to the eye of
memory
.
We pursued the devious route, and once
more I found myself retracing a region, which
though for months untrodden, was still as
freshly in my recollections, as when I made it
the field of exercise for all the black and
blasting
passions running then riot in my soul. On
we went from point to point, of all the places
in my memory, each of which had its distinct
association, and spoke audibly to my spirit of
some endearment or reproach, some sorrow
or delight. Here was the little lake,here
the islet where I first discovered her. Here
the scene of her dishonor and of my triumph
here the place of our usual meeting, and here
the spot upon which she perished under my
hands. I strove not to look. I felt all things
too vividly in my soul, and though I closed
my eyes, I could not shut out the images of
terror which were momentarily conjured up
by my imagination. I strove to look in all
quarters but in that which witnessed our
struggle and my crime, but my eyes
invariably
turned at last and settled down on the one
spot, where, I beheld, at length, the distinct
outline of her figure, as it had, at the time,
appeared before me. Slowly it seemed to
rise from its recumbent posture, and, while I
breathed not, I beheld it proceed along the road
which I had taken, when bearing the
inanimate
burden from which that now guiding
spirit had forever departed, to its place of
final slumber in the body of the rock, which
stood rigidly in the distance. I followed it,
unconsciously, with my eyes. My
respiration
had utterly ceasedmy hair was moist
and activemy lips were colorless and cold,
and my cheeks were ashen. A palsying wind
seemed to penetrate my bones, and though
not a joint trembled, yet they were all
powerless
.
I became conscious at last of my
condition
and appearance, from discovering the
eyes of Harding anxiously bent upon mine
and following the direction of their gaze.
13
There was something so expressiveso
earnest
in his look, that, though yet utterly
unsuspicious
of his design, I was nevertheless not
a little offended at his seeming curiosity. I
recovered myself on the instant of making
this discovery, and turned round abruptly
upon him. As if detected in some
impropriety
,
his eyes fell from the look which I gave
him in evident confusion; and, without a
word, we prepared to proceed in our ramble.
Not willing to suggest a solitary movement
while in this region, which should prompt
doubt or inquiry, I left the choice of road to
himself, and saw with some concern that we
were now taking the direct route to the
cottage
of old Andrews, the father of Emily. I
had no fear of exposure from any such
interview
,
for, I had so contrived it, that all
suspicion
was diverted from myself in the minds
of the family. I had busied myself in the
little inquiries that had been made into her
fatehad pretended not a small portion of
sorrow and regrethad made sundry presents,
which in the depressed condition in which
they lived, had readily contributed still more
to their blindness; and never having been
recognized
,
in the dotage of the old man, as the
boy who had contributed to his first great
misfortune
,
I had escaped all imputations on the
subject of the second. Besides, I had taken
care to visit them frequently, though privately,
for a short period of time after the event, and
felt secure that I had no other position in their
regard, than that of confiding and friendly
consideration
.
But the subject had become
irksome
,
and, in addition to this fact, I had, for
the first time, perceived in my mind the
possibility
that my companion, coupling the
conversation
of the family, which would most
probably turn upon the fate of their daughter,
with my own story, might be enabled to gather
from the particulars such information as would
open the trail, and prepare the way for further
evidence. But the cautious policy of Harding
silenced my alarm, and indeed, my great error
from the first, consisted in the humble estimate
I had been taught to make of his character for
firmness. There is no greater mistake, than in
despising him to whom you have given a
reason
to become an enemy. Where there is
mind, contempt will engender malice, and
where there is malice, there is a ceaseless
prompter, which one day will couple the
venom
with the sting. Self-esteem in exaggerating
my own strength to myself, had also taught me
to undervalue that of othersin this way, I
assisted
his pursuit, and helped him to his object.
We came soon upon the cottage. The old
man sat glowering in idiotic abstraction in a
corner chair, which he kept in a continual
rocking motion. His mind seemed utterly
gone, and though he spoke to both, he
appeared
to recognize neither of us. His wife was
glad to see me, and thanked me repeatedly for
some articles of dress which I had sent her
some months before, since which period, until
then, I had not seen her. An unavoidable
association
called up the memory of Emily, and
the tears of the old woman were again
renewed
.
Harding with an air of common-place
inquiry
,
and a manner of the most perfect
indifference
,
almost amounting to unconsciousness,
13*
inquired into the story to which she had
referred
,
and while she told it as far as it was known
to herself, busied himself in plaiting into
something
like form, the remains of a handful of
osiers which he had plucked on the way. His
very indifference, had not my fate otherwise
ordained, should have alarmed my
watchfulness
,
so utterly different did it appear from the
emotion which he usually expressed when
called to listen to a narrative so sorrowful and
touching. But he heard it, as if in a dream.
His mind seemed wandering, and I was lulled
into the most complete security. Never was
indifference so well enactednever had mortal
been more attentive to a history than Harding
to this. All its details had been carefully
treasured
up, and where the old lady had associated
me with the adventures of her daughter, his
mind had taken deep note, and the record in his
memory was ineradicably written. Over the
chimney place stood a rude portrait of the
murdered
girl, to which, when the old lady called
for his attention to her beautiful features, he
scarcely gave a glance; and he, whom destiny
selected to bring the murderer of her child to
punishment, provoked openly the anger of the
mother, by his glaring inattention to the story of
her supposed fate. We left the cottage after a
somewhat protracted visit. I had no concern
not the slightest apprehension, so completely
had my companion played his part in the
transaction
but
he had not lost a word, not a look
not an action, in all the events of that morning.
His eye was forever upon mehis thoughts
were dissecting mine, and the most distant
association
of cause and effect, drawn vividly
together
by his intellect, quickened into sleepless
exercise and energy by the influences acting
upon it, supplied him with the materials for
commencing the true history of my crime.
We passed the rock on our return. I could
not keep my eyes from it; and his eyes were
on mine. He saw the same ashy paleness of
my cheek and look, and he saw that this rock
had something to do with my history. In the
analysis of a story like mineso terribly
romantic
as it washis imagination became a
prime auxiliar, and with its aid, where a dull
man would have paused for fact, with the
felicity
of truth, it supplied them, and he grew
confident and strong in each hour of
progression
in his labor.
CHAPTER XV.
A week from this had not gone by, when,
while under the hands of our village
hair-dresser
,
I beheld a picture crowded among the
hundred
upon his walls, which filled me with
astonishment
,
and awakened in my mind some
moving apprehensions. I beheld the scene of
my crime truly done to nature, and just by the
little copse upon which the deed had been
committed
,
stood a female form, pale and shadowy,
and with a sufficient resemblance to Emily,
to have been considered a portrait. You may
guess my emotion. Having recovered from
the first shock, I inquired, as if without the
desire
for an answer, where he got and who had
painted it, and was told in reply that an old
lady had brought it there for salethe lady was
unknown. Finding the price lowmerely
nominal
,
indeed, he had readily bought it;
relying
on the merits of the piece to insure it a
ready sale. I affected to be pleased with it
and paid him his price. Having secured it in
possession, I examined it closely, and was
confirmed
in the opinion that the whole was copied
from events in my own history. Beyond this
I could perceive nothing farther. The
preparation
of the piece was a mystery, and I had
not the courage to seek its developement. I
cut up the tell-tale fabric with my knife, and
witnessed its destruction, fragment by
fragment
,
in the flames. Fool that I was, I did not
dream that the artist had yet other copies.
And so it wasanother and another, to the
number of three, appeared in the crowded
shop of the hair-dresser. I was too sagacious,
however, to purchase any more. I had begun
to tremble! Still I had not the slightest
suspicion
of the author, and though my thoughts
were restlessly employed upon the subject,
they wandered to all persons and conjectured
all things but the right. Still, daily, did
Harding
and myself pursue our rambles, and, each
day, through his adroit ingenuity, yielded
something
more to the stock of that evidence which
was to overwhelm me. By degrees, he had
penetrated in all directions of that fatal wood;
and, at length, our footsteps were bent, as in
the most casual manner, up the steep sides of
the rock, and over the very path, which,
burdened
with the dead body of Emily Andrews,
I had once journeyed alone. My eyes were
again riveted upon that fearful chasmI heard
the dead fall of her delicate form, as it struck
from side to side in its passage downI heard
the clattering of the loosened stones which
had accompanied and followed her; and, at
length, the same subtle imagination which
had revived all the circumstances vividly
before
one sense, arrayed her reanimated form
as vividly before another. I saw her arise
from the chasm, pale and ghastly as when I
had seen her descend. For a moment the
spell of terror fixed every faculty, and in that
moment, the searching glance of my
companion
,
had gathered much towards the formation
of his testimony. He had followed the
direction
of my glance, and the chasm, half
concealed
in the umbrage, and not very obvious
to the gaze, grew distinctly before him. I
recovered
from the trance which had for a time
stupified me, and we returned to the village.
In a few days more, and another scene, to me
full of fearful meaning was in the shop of my
hair-dresser. There was the rockthere the
chasm, and just above, in a dim haze that made
vague the expression and outline, but did not
impair the features, stood the phantom person
of Emily, as my imagination had borne it to
my sight but a few days before. Who was it,
that, with so much felicity, could embody my
imaginings. I was thunderstruck, and, through
the means of an agent, I secured this new
accuser
,
and destroyed it in like manner with
the former. But another self made its
appearance
,
and, in despair, I gave up the hope
of arresting, in this way, the progress of that
inquiry, which, taking so equivocal a form, and
14
pursuing a course so mysterious, was doubly
terrible. But Harding, for he was the artist,
did not alone content himself with probing
the secrets of my soul, by exercising my fears
and fancies. He privately took his way to the
family of the murdered girl. He ascertained
the day and date of her absencehe took
careful
note of our associationof the expectations
that had been formed in their minds, not less
than in the mind of Emily herself, from the
attentions I had paid her; and though the
true nature of our connexion had been totally
unsuspected by the parents, our intimacy
had been such as to warrant a belief, that,
in the progress of events, something must
necessarily grow out of it. He found that
we had been almost in the daily habit of
meeting, and in the very wood in which
he had first perceived my terrors. He
learned
,
that, in dragging the stream in its
neighborhood
,
no traces had been found of the
victimthat a search, made shortly after she
had been missing, and on the same day,
throughout the country, for many miles, had
been ineffectual. He was conscious that few
places of concealment offered themselves in
the circuit so examined, except in the cavity
of rock to which his mind had already
adverted
;
and, associating the ill disguised
apprehension
and horror which I had exhibited while
upon it, he came to the rapid conclusion that
the mystery was to be developed there. Yet
how was he now to proceed? There was still
something wanting to unite together the
several
links in the chain of testimony which he
had so assiduously and singularly woven.
The circumstances, though strong, were not
at all conclusive against me; and, having
succeeded so poorly in the first instance,
and with the public prejudice so strongly
against him, he might well dread the overthrow
of his design, in the event of any premature
and partial development. Though
perfectly
satisfied that the chasm contained the
remains of the murdered girl, he was yet well
convinced how little the mere development
of the body would avail, unless with some
identifying circumstance, fixing the crime
upon me. Accordingly, he devoted himself
busily to the task of tracing in the details of
the mother, all the particulars of my intimacy
with the daughter. In this scrutiny he
happened
upon, read carefully, and copied a
single note having my initials, merely, but
without date, which I had sent her,
enclosing
some ornaments for her person and
engaging
to meet her on some day in the ensuing
week. The style of expression was guarded
in the extreme, and indicated the feelings of
one who esteemed the individual he
addressed
,
with a respectful consideration, which
though not love itself, might in time, become
so. The absence of a date, alone, presented a
difficulty, which was only overcome, by a single
passage which the note contained. It spoke
of pressing engagements for a term of some
weeks which would so occupy the attention
of the writer as to leave him no
opportunity
of seeing her for that period unless that
which the note suggested was embraced.
What engagements were there of so pressing
a character upon me? Harding knew as well
14*
as myself the nature of my employments, and
felt assured that the assertion was either false,
or that the note had been written at the time,
when my marriage arrangements had been
made; the only circumstance he conceived
likely to have been looked to in my mind, as
calculated to interfere with the pursuit of any
humbler object. This was conjectural,
however
,
yet the conjecture furnished him with
an additional clue which he suffered not to
escape him. The old lady could say nothing
as to the period when the note had been
received
but
the jewels were shown him, and
carefully noting down their kinds and
qualities
,
he proceeded to the several shops of our
village in which such articles were sold. He
inspected all of corresponding description, and
submitting those in question, he at length found
out to whom and when they were sold. The
dates were supplied, and were so far found to
correspond with events, that it was indubitable
that but four days after their purchase by
myself
,
Emily Andrews had been lost to her
family
.
The circumstances were now almost
embodied
in the estimation of the law; and
assured
,
but still unprecipitate, Harding
prepared
calmly and quietly the whole narrative, and
awaited impatiently the operation of looked
for events, to unfold the entire history. And
the time came!
CHAPTER XVI.
Fate had me in its power, and I was blind.
If I were not weak enough, of myself, to reveal
the secrets of my soul, and its crimes, I was
not less the creature of a destiny, which, in the
end, set at nought my profoundest cunning,
and proved my wisdom to be the arrantest
folly
.
I look back now with wonder at my own
stupidity. A single survey into existing things,
as in all other concerns I had certainly made
it, and I should have laughed all inquisition to
scorn. Now, I am its victimthe shallow
victim of a most shallow design. Thus it is,
however, that the wisest suffer defeat through
a self-esteem which leads them into wrong, not
merely in their estimate of themselves, but in
their estimate of others. Thus was it with
me; and well, from my own experience, may
I exclaim with the ancient,
fata viam
invenient
.'
Yet was I not unwarnedunthreatened. I
had a presentiment that something was to
happen
I
was uneasy, discontentedwandering.
My spirits were dreadfully depressed, and but
half conscious, I took my way to the secluded
cottage of Harding. Unannounced, I entered
his study, and found himon his knees, at
prayer. A strange feeling possessed me, and
I was almost tempted to kneel down beside
him. But I dared notI had never been
taught to worshipI had never been taught to
bend the knee, and tones of supplication were
foreign to my sense and unfamiliar to my lips.
Could I have knelt at that moment and
fervently
prayed for the grace I had not, I feel
satisfied the heart of my companion would have
relented of all its purposes. He would not,
at that moment, have arrested the new-born
exercises of a spirit so redeeming and atoning.
The moment of indulgence was permitted to
escape, and the fiat had gone forth. The
doom was upon me!
We sallied forth, as had been, for so long a
period, our morning custom. A grave
solemnity
marked the expression of Harding's
countenance
,
mixed, at intervals, as we grew more
and more communicative, with a faltering
hesitation
of manner, indicating a relaxing of
purpose
.
I can now comprehend all his feelings
and emotions. His position was, indeed, a
strange and sad one. Under a sense of duty
the most sacred, not merely to the
community
,
but to himself, he had undertaken the
punishment of a criminal with whom he was
in the daily habit of close communionto
whom, in worldly matters, he was somewhat
indebted, and in whose welfare, he had at heart,
and sincerely, a deep interest. The task of
hypocrisy which he assumed, sufficiently
painful
to a mind like his, was doubly irksome
under
the operation of such circumstances; and,
I am assured that could he, at that moment,
have been persuaded of a change of heart in
mehad I given him the slightest reason to
believe that my crimes were regretted, and
that it was my fixed purpose to become a
better
man,he would, even then, just as the
curtain was about to be drawn, which would
unveil the whole catastrophe, have stayed his
uplifted handhe would have rather suffered
the tortures of his imagination, and the rebukes
of his ambition, than have cut off the penitent
in his first approaches to pardon and
atonement
.
But, at this moment, I uttered some
vile jestdiscreditable to manhood and
morality
,
alikeand the spell was broken. He
was strengthened in his purpose, and
solemnly
he led the way, I following, unconsciously,
to my own sacrifice.
A sudden turn brought us directly upon the
scene of my crime, and there, to my surprise, a
goodly company were assembled.
What is this! was my exclamation. Why
are so many of the villagers here. Know you
what is meant by this assemblage?
We shall see! was his somewhat sudden
and stern reply, as we continued to approach.
My heart trembled, and leapt convulsively to
my mouthmy knees faltered, but there was no
retreat. We came up to the company before
whom my appearance had scarcely been made,
when, wildly from the group, rushed forth the
mother of Emilyshe seized me by my arm.
Give me back my daughter was her
frenzied
exclamationyou will not keep her
from me. My daughtermy poor sweet
Emily
.
They dragged her back to the spot, where,
feebly and with an expression of subdued
idiocy
,
old Andrews incessantly shook his stick in
the direction where I stood, while his palsied
head maintained a corresponding motion. I
recovered myself, but my tones were husky
and thick, and I am satisfied not so coherent
as I could have wished them.
15
What does all this mean, my friends; why
this charge upon mewhy this gathering
was my inquiry.
This gentleman will explain said the
Justice
,
pointing to Harding who had by this time
taken a place midway between the company
and myself, you are charged, continued the
officer, with having first seduced, then
spirited
away the daughter of these old people, one
Emily Andrews; and for your sake, Mr. Faber,
I sincerely hope that you may be able to
establish
your innocence in spite of the strong
circumstances which will be brought against
you.
I looked to HardingI sought to crush him
with that lookbut he was untroubled,
unappalled
beneath it; and, though trembling with
emotion, as seemingly determined in intention,
as the martyr, fortifying if not establishing his
faith, by the free offering of his blood. He
proceeded, modestly, but confidently to his
narration. He recounted the history of our
intimacydescribed once more the
circumstances
of the revelation which I had made, in
his ears, of my crime. How it had burned in
his heart like so many living coals. How
he had come in his agony to me, and how
finally, in order to escape from the
suggestions
of torture inflicted by conscience and
imagination, he had revealed it as it had before
been heard, to the officers of justice. He
showed how he had been overthrown by the
search made in accordance with the story
how, writhing under the reproaches of the
public and crushed in their opinion, he had
been on the verge of madness and suicide
how I had sought him out in his closet
repeated
my story, and how he had again
believed
it. A certain something, he said,
assured
him that I had told the truth, but not the
whole truththat I had suppressed and
altered
,
so as to defeat inquiry; but that, though
the causes which had led me to disclose so
much unnecessarily, were unknown and
unaccountable
,
he was taught to believe in the
commission
of the crime. A desire to regain his
station in societyto show that nothing of
malice had prompted him in the first instance,
inspired him with the design, which, carried
out perseveringly and properly, had resulted in
his being able, he thought, most satisfactorily
to prove the murder of Emily Andrews by
Martin Faber, and accordingly, he proceeded
to the development of his particulars. How
did I wonder at my own blindness as he
proceeded
in his narration. How did I wonder at
the ingenuity with which, without any clue, he
had unravelled, as with my own fingers, all
my secret. He had watched all my
motions
all
my looksall my words. He had
suffered not a glancenot a whisper to
escape
him. With the assistance of his mother,
who, herself, in disguise had sold them to the
barber, he had carried on the affair of the
pictures
he
discovered who had bought them,
and conjecturing for what purpose, he defied me
to produce them. He described the
involuntary
terrors which my face had exhibited on
approaching the spot upon which we stood
how the same emotion, so exhibited, had led
him to suspect that the rock to which he
pointed
had also some connexion with the
transaction
.
15*
The facts gathered from the
conversations
with the family, leading to the final, and,
as he thought, conclusive proof, in reference to
the jewelry he next dwelt upon; and, with a
brief but compact summary, he so concentrated
the evidence, that, though strictly speaking,
still inconclusive, there was not an individual
present but was persuaded of my guilt.
And now, said he, there is but one more
witness for examination, and this is the rock
of which I have spoken. I am persuaded
that the body of Emily Andrews lies there.
The expression of Faber's eyethe whole
look with which he surveyed the chasm,
could not have come from nothing. That
rock, in some way or other, is associated with
his crime. I have made arrangements for its
examination and we shall soon judge.
Placing a little ivory whistle to his lips, a
shrill sound went through the forest, and after
the lapse of a moment, a sudden flash
illuminated
,
and a loud explosion shook the earth
around us. We proceeded to the spot, and
when the smoke had cleared away, a shout
from those who traversed the fragments, torn
from the fissure which had been split by
gun-powder
,
announced the discovery of the
victim
,
and in her handsconclusive evidence
against metorn from my bosom without my
knowledge, while in the last convulsion of
death,lay the large brooch, the loss of which
had given me so much concern at the time,
and, on its back, chased finely in the gold
setting, were the initials of my name.
CHAPTER XVII.
He came to me in my dungeonhe, my
accusermy enemymy friend. In the first
emotions of my wrath, I would have strangled
him, and I shook my chains in his face, and I
muttered savage curses and deep threats in his
ears. He stood patiently and unmoved. His
hands were clasped, and his eyes were dim,
and for a while he had no language, no
articulations
.
Think not, at last he spokethink not
I have come to this work with a feeling of
satisfaction
.
I have suffered more agony in its
progress than I can well describe or you
understand
I
will not attempt it. If you
cannot
,
from what you know of my character,
conceive the grief and sickness of heart which
must have come over me, during the long
period
and regular and frequent succession of
hours, in which I was required to play the
hypocriteI cannot teach it you. I come not
for this. I come to ask your forgivenessto
implore your better opinionand that you
may attribute to a necessity which gave me
no other alternatives than death or shame, the
whole of this painful episode in my life!
He was a noble creature, and so I could not
but think at that very moment; but, I was of
the earth, earthy! I was a thing of
comprehensive
malignity, and my impulses were
perpetually
warring with the suggestions of my
sense.
My death be upon your headmy
ignominy
be yoursthe curses of all of mine be
on youmay all things curse you. Talk of
my being a murderer, are you less so? Have
you not hurried me to deatha shameful
deathdishonoring myself, dishonoring my
family, when I might have atoned for the error
of my youth, in the progress and better
performances
of my age? Hypocrite, that you
are, begone! Come not falsely now to
extenuate
what you may not excuseyour
priestly cant about forgiveness does not
deceive
me. AwayI curse you to the last!
and his head sunk upon his breast, and his
hands were clasped in agony, and I exulted in
the writhing and gnawing of that heart, whose
over-delicate structure, I well knew, could
never
sustain such reproaches.
Spare me, spare me! As I live you do me
wrong. Be not so mercilessso unforgiving.
Fame, and the world's good opinion, were to
me the breath of life. I could not have done
other than I did and livedI could not.
Looked you then to me to do it? Was
the world's good opinion nothing to me? Had
I nothing to live for? Had I no aim in life?
Ohaway! I sicken but to see you!
Patiently, amidst all my reproaches, he
persisted
in the endeavour to conciliate my
fiendish
mood, suggesting a thousand excuses and
reasons, for the obvious duty which I myself
felt he had done to himself and to society
but I rejected them all, and, in despair, he was
about to retire, when a sudden thought came
over me.
Stay, Hardingthere is one thingthere
is one way in which I can be assured that your
motive was not malicious, and that you have
been stimulated as you say, solely by a belief
in the necessity of what you have done!
Speaksay, any thing, but grant me your
forgivenessgive me your good opinion!
Ridiculous! the good opinion of a
murderer
the
hated, the despised of the
community
;of
what good is it to you or to any body?
Truetrue!but even with the murderer
I would be at peaceI would not have him
die with an ill feeling towards me. But there
is yet another thought which prompts the
desire
in his case. It is from my associate
and companion that I would have forgiveness,
for the violation of that confidence which grew
out of that association. For this I would have
your forgiveness!
The distinction is somewhat nice, but you
shall have what you askcheerfully have it
upon one condition!
What is that, say onI will gladly serve
you.
Justice demands a victim and I must die;
but it is not necessary to justice that I should
die in a particular manner. I would not die
by the rope, in the presence of a gaping
multitude
you
must provide me with a dagger
a knife, any thing by which I may free myself
from the ignominy of such a death.
Impossible! that will be wrongit will
be criminal. Justice, it is true, may not care
whether the rope or the steel shall serve her
purposes, but she requires that her officer, at
16
least, shall do it; otherwise it is not her act.
It is your will, not hers, that would be
performed
her
claim would be defeated.
Shallow sophistry!this then is your
friendshipbut I knew it would be so
away, and may
He stopped me in my curse.
Stay!he exclaimed hurriedly, and with
terrorany thing but that. I will do as you
require.
CHAPTER XVIII.
The day of retributionof a fearful trial,
is come!Horrible mockery!the sunlight
streams through the iron grating, and falls upon
the straw of this accursed dungeon. How
beautifullyhow wooingly it lookslovelier
than ever, about to be forever lost! Do I
tremble
would
I yet live and linger out the years
in a life of curses, among those who howl
their denunciations forever in my ears? Could
I survive this exposure, this infamy, and
cherish
life on any terms and at all hazards! I
would not dienot thus, not thuson that
horrible scaffolding, I shudder but to think on.
Yet what hope would I rely upon? I have
none to whom in this perilous hour, I would
turn in expectation. No fond spirit now
labors
,
unsleepingly, for my relief. I have not
lived for such an interestI have not sought
to enlist such affectionsnone hopenone
seek my escapenone would assist in its
consummation! I am aloneI must die!
and what,horrible thought!if he should
not bring the weapon?if his shrinking and
woman-like conscience should scruple, thus,
to interfere with the decree of justice, and I
should be led out in the accursed cart, through
the jeering multitude, and go through all the
trials of that death of shame and muscular
agony!let me not think of it. Let me not
think!
And I closed my eyes as if to shut out
thought, and rushed to the extremest corner
of my cell, despairing of the appearance of
Harding with the dagger he had promised.
But a few hours were left, and the sharp and
repeated strokes of the hammer, at a little
distance, indicated the rapid progress of the
executioner in his preparations for the terrible
performance of his office. I groaned in my
agony of thought, and buried my head still
deeper in the meshes of my couch.Thanks,
thanksthe fates be praisedhe comesthe
bolts shoot backthe doors are unbarredhe
is here! I live againI shall not stand then on
that fearful fabric. He brings me that which
shall enable me to give it my defiance, and
disappoint the gaping multitude, already
beginning
to assemble. I shall defeat them
still!
16*
Oh, HardingI had almost given you up
I had begun to despondto despair. I
dreaded that the weakness of your spirit had
yielded to your conscience, and that you had
forgotten your pledge. God of terror! what a
horrible agony the thought brought along with
it. It is well you came; I had else cursed
you with spectres that would have fastened on
you like wolves. They would have drained
the blood, at the same moment, from all the
arteries in your system. Give me the knife.
It is here, and, oh, MartinI have had a
terrible struggle with my own sense of what
is right in the performance of this office. I
have resisted the suggestions of conscience
I have overcome the rebukes of my own mind
I have done wrong, and do not seek to
excuse
myselfbut I have brought you what
you desired. Here, take it, take it at once
and quickly before I repent me of having so
weakly yielded in the struggle.
I have itI have it! I shouted wildly
shaking the naked blade as if in defiance, in
the direction of the scaffold. I am secure
from that shameI shall not be the capped
and culprit thing of ignominy which they
would make me, in the eyes of that morbid
rabble. I am free from the dishonor of such
a death. Ah, Harding, thou hast almost
redeemed
thy faultthou hast almost taught me
to forgive thee for thy offending. NayI
could almost forbear to howl my curses in thy
ears, and avoid saying to thee, as I domay
the furies tug at thy vitals, like snakes, in all
hours
Forbear, forbear! he shriekedoh, cruel;
wantonly cruel as thou artwhere is thy
promise, Martinwhere is thy honorwilt
thou deceive me?
Ha! ha! ha!fool that thou artdidst
thou not deceive and betray me? Where was
thy honor, false hypocritewhere was thy
forbearing mercy? Wert thou not cruel,
wantonly cruel then? Hell's curses be upon
theeI would have thee live forever to enjoy
themthou shouldst have an eternity of
torment
thou
shouldst have an exaggerated
sense of life for its better appreciation.
Forbearance
,
indeed! NoI would invent a
curse for thee thatand ha! thou art come in
season, at the fit moment, to be my help in
imprecation. Come forwardthou has lips
would make an oath telland tell to the quick.
Come hither, come hither, my Constance!
And he dragged forward the young and
terrified
wife, who had just then made her
appearance
in the dungeon, and forcing her upon
her knees before him, he stood over her,
waving
the gleaming dagger in her eyes.
Thou shalt kneel, Constance!it is a
solemn moment, and thou hast that to perform
which requires that word and action should
well suit its solemnity. Ay, fold thy hands
upon thy breastyet I ask thee not to pray
thou must curse and not pray. Speak then
as I tell theespeak and palter with me not,
for, doomed as I am to death, and hopeless of
escape, as I have nothing now to hope, I have
nothing now to apprehend from man. Speak
after me, then, as thou hast a love for lifeas
thou hast a leading and a lasting terror of a
horrible death!
Agonized with the situation of Constance,
Harding advanced to interfere, but with a
giant-like strength, the criminal hurled him
back with a single arm, while he threatened, if
he again approached, to bury the weapon in
the bosom of the kneeling and terror-stricken
woman. On a sudden, she recovered her
energies, and in coherent but feeble tones, she
called upon her husband to proceed.
It is well thou art thus docile. Thou art
wise, Constancethou art obedient, as thou
hast ever been. Keep thy hands folded, and
speak after mesay, in thy wonted manner to
thy Godbid him hearken to thy prayerbid
him, in tenderness and love for thee, to grant
it as thou makest it. Promise him largely of
thy increased love and obedience for this.
Promise him thy exclusive devotionsay
thou wilt live only for him; and strive to
forget
all the other attractions, whatever they
may be, of life and society. I care not if thou
keepest these pledges, it is enough for me
that thou makest them.
She did as she was required. She
implored
the Father, fervently to sanction the
prayer she was about to makeshe vowed
her whole love and duty, in return, so far as
her poor capacities would permit, entirely to
him. She spoke in the fullness of
accumulated
feelings, and with a devotion as deep and
touching, as it was tearless and dignified.
Wellthat is enough. Thou hast been
as liberal in promises, as I could well desire
thee; and now for the prayer and petition thou
hast to offer. Look on this manthe
murderer
of thy husbandthe wretch, who,
wouldst thou believe it, my Constance, has
the audacity to have a love even for thee, in
his cruel heartthe wretch, whomthou wilt
be slow to think so, my Constance, but it is
truewhom thou dost love
She looked up to him, as he proceeded, with
a most imploring expressionbut he had no
touch of pity in his soul. He proceeded
It is true, and you dare not deny it, my
Constance. You love the wretch who has
murdered your husband, and, perhaps, when
my bloody grave, which his hands have dug,
has been well covered over, you will take
shelter in his bosom
The wretched woman shrieked in agony,
and fell at length upon the floorbut he
allowed
her no respite. After a few moments,
making her resume her position upon her
knees, he continued
Him, thou must curse! Say after me
God of heaven and earth, if thou be, as thou
art said to be, just in thy provisions Say
on!
She repeated: He went on.
If the power be in thee, as I believe, to do
the will of thy creatures on earth
She repeated.
If thou canst curse and blessbuild up and
destroyyield pleasure or painmake happy
or miserable
She repeated.
I call upon thee, with thy agents and
ministering
powers to curse with thy eternal
wrathto blister with thy unceasing
severities
to
17
torture with thy utmost varieties of
painto make sore the bodyto make bitter
the lifeto make wretched the spiritto
pursue
at all seasons and in all lands, with thy
unceasing and most aggravated asperities, this
bloody man, the destroyer of my husband.
The youth, upon whom this imprecation
was to fall, rushed forward
Speak it not! oh, speak it not, lady!in
charity speak it not. I can bear with the
curse from his lipsfrom any lipsbut thine.
Sanction not, I pray you, this wantoness of
crueltypardon rather, and forgive me that I
have been the unwilling, and, in all times, the
sad instrument of Providence in this
proceeding
.
Back, back, William Hardingthe curse
must be utteredit must be feltit must be
borne. Speak on, Constance Faberspeak
onas I have told it thee. She looked up in
his face with the calm resignation of a saint
and, as one entering upon the pilgrimage of
martyrdom, she proceeded regularly in the
formula, sentence after sentence, which he
had prescribed; while he, standing above,
muttered
his gratification as every added word
seemed to arouse new agonies in the bosom
of the denounced. But, as she reached the
part assigned to the application of the curse,
she entreated these curses upon the head of
Constance Faber, if she should ever teach
her lips to invoke other than blessings upon
any being of the human family, whatever, in
the sight of heaven or of earth, his offence
might be! The glare from the eyes of the
disappointed criminal was that of a hyena,
robbed of his prey. A malignant shriek burst
from his lips, as, with uplifted arm and furious
stroke, he aimed the weapon at her bosom.
Harding sprang forward, but the weapon, as
she swooned away from the blow, had
penetrated
her side. The youth, with unlooked for
power, tore her from his grasp, before his blow
could be repeated, and bore her out of his
reach to the opposite part of the cell. The
keeper and his assistants rushed in upon the
prisoner. As they approached, he aimed the
bloody dagger at his own bosom, but, at that
instant, fear came over his heartthe fates had
paralyzed himhe was a coward! he shrunk
back from the stroke and the dagger fell from
his hands. Without difficulty he was in a
moment secured. Constance was but slightly
wounded, yet happily, enough so, to be
entirely
ignorant of the horrors of the scene so
malignantly forced upon her. In his cell, the
wretch howled over the unperforming
weakness
of his hand, which had not only failed to
secure him his victim, but had left him
without
the ability to defeat his doom.
* * * * * * * *
The hour is come! O cursed weakness, that
I should fail at that moment of escapeBut
the fates had written itI must fulfil my
destiny
.
My eyes grow dimI fail to see any
longer the crowdall is confused and terrible.
What spectres are these that surround me? It
is Emily,and why does the old father shake
his palsied hand in my facewill no one keep
off the intruders?they have no concern here.
I have ravedbut now all is before me. What a
multitudedoes this suffering of a fellow
creature
18
give them pleasure! Should I askI who
have lived in that enjoyment! Would I had also
been weak; I should have escaped this
exposure
this
pain. It is but for a moment,
however
but
a momentary thrill; and thenfate
will have no secrets. I shall no longer be its
blind victimits slave. There is an old man
at the foot of the scaffold, that I would not see
there! It is old Andrews. Would he were
goneor that I could look elsewhere. But no
matterit will soon be over. I would I had
a God at this momentbetter to have believed
on earth there is nothing for mesuch a
faith, though folly, had been grateful. But
nownow it is too late. The hour is come!
The sunlight and the skies are gonegone
gonegone.
