LETTER XL.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Oak-hall
,
May
17
th
, 1781.
This
is a charming romantic place, my
dear Celia. There is room for
solitude
and deep reflection. Oak-hall is
situated
in
a very retired part of the country, and has
been the family
mansion
of the
Rooksby
's
from time immemorial. The
house
is
antique
,
and
inspires
one's mind with the true
spirit
of the days of chivalry. You cannot
think, how often I
amuse
myself
with
surveying
its antique battlements, the
massy
gates, and deep moat, that
surround
it;
and while I gaze with a kind of reverential
awe, I fancy, I am perhaps retracing the
steps
of many a gallant knight and beauteous
dame who formerly have been inhabitants
of this ancient dwelling. I am a great
admirer
of every thing, that wears the face of
antiquity not that I would, were I
possessed
of ever
so
large a fortune, lay out my money
in
purchasing
a heap of trumpery, that are
really of no
intrinsie
value, only as the fancy
of the
virtuoso
stamps
them with the
appellation
of excellence,
because
they were made
some
hundred years before we were born.
I cannot deny, that I like to examine any
little piece of antiquity, which tends to
shew
us the
progress
of the arts or manufactures,
and when I enjoy the benefit of any thing
useful
or convenient I feel a kind of
veneration
for the genius, who
first
invented it,
let it be ever
so
mean or trifling.
May
20
th.
Mr.
Rooksby
arrived
yesterday
and has
this morning, not to my
surprize
, but to my
infinite regret, made me an offer of his hand
and fortune. It is not, my dear Celia, that
I am
stoic
enough to pretend, I have an
aversion
to being
raised
from a
state
of
dependence
A 2
to be
mistress
of
seven
thousand
pounds a year: but I feel, I
shall
never
regard
Mr.
Rooksby
with the affection, which,
in my opinion, is
absolutely
necessary
, to
make the married
state
comfortable, though
Mrs.
Rooksby
tells me, that in this I am
mistaken
, as
she
was perfectly happy while
her
husband
lived; and yet
she
declares
she
acceded to the union merely in compliance
with the
desires
of her parents. It may be
so
, Celia, but I am certain I
should
never be
happy with a man, whom I regard with
indifference. But I will give you an account
of a
conversation
, I had this morning with
this invader of my peace (I
must
call him
so
,
for had it not been for him I
should
have
felt
myself
quite happy in my
present
situation
.)
We had
just
finished
breakfast
, when
a
servant
informed Mrs.
Rooksby
a poor
woman
desired
to
speak
with her. The good
old lady is benevolent and humane to all her
poor neighbours, and the
honest
industrious
when
oppressed
by misfortune are always
sure
of meeting a friend in her.
I had not been alone with Mr.
Rooksby
before,
since
my
residence
in the family and
to tell you the truth, I would gladly have
walked ten miles to have avoided it now.
But there was no flying;
politeness
obliged
me to
sit
still
;
besides
I thought it would
look
so
like being afraid of the man,
so
childish
to run away as
soon
as his mother
left the roomthat I
sat
very
composedly
and took up my work, which opportunely
was in the room.We were
silent
near ten
minutes, when at length he
spoke
.
May I venture to enquire how
Miss
Howard likes the
situation
of my mother's
house
?
I think it extremely
pleasant
,
sir
. It
suits
the turn of my mind; I am fond of
solitude
and
should
be quite happy were I
certain of never wandering from this
delightful
spot
, to the gay regions of
fashion
,
folly, and what is in general termed
pleasure
.
How blind are you to your own merits,
my dear
Miss
, if you
wish
thus to hide in
obscurity
, beauty and virtue, that would do
honour to a court.
You make me
smile
, Mr.
Rooksby
, how
would your gay companions ridicule you
could they hear you thus
lavishly
complimenting
an humble dependant of your
mother's
.
And let them laugh, my dear
Miss
Howard, for did they know as I do the true
value of your worth, they would like me,
adore it.
This, my dear Celia, was not to be
answered
:
so
I was obliged to be content with
remaining
silent
and looking like an idiot.
While he continued, I am fully
sensible
of
my own
unworthiness
in
presuming
to
become
a candidate for
Miss
Howard's favour.
I know how full of error my
short
career of
life has been; but I
trust
your benevolent
spirit
will pardon my
past
follies; and could
I
presume
to hope you would
condescend
to
accept my hand and fortune, I am certain
by a
constant
contemplation of the
goodness
it would
strive
to immitate, my heart
would
soon
be an offering worthy of your
acceptance.
Dear Celia, how extremely
embarrassing
was my
situation
? I felt my face glow. I
dared not look up: at length I
summoned
sufficient
courage to
speak
.
I hardly know,
sir
, in what manner to
reply. If the offer you have
just
made be
seriously
meant.
If it be
serious
,
Miss
Howard, can you
suppose
I would trifle on
so
important a
subject
, with any woman, much more with
one
so
truly amiable as
yourself
. Believe
me, my charming girl, there is no event
could render me
so
happy, or convey
such
unmixed felicity to the
bosom
of my mother,
as to
see
you become a part of a family
which may derive honour from, but can
confer none by the alliance.
Your polite and generous
proposal
,
sir
,
demands a candid
answer
. I feel
myself
infinitely
obliged by the regard with which
you are
pleased
to honour me; at the
same
time I am under the
necessity
of declining
your offer. I hope you will believe I am
not ungrateful for the
esteem
and
friendship
I have fortunately met with in your mother's
family, and permit me to add, I
shall
always
regard her as an affectionate parent and you
as a brother: but as to any nearer tie, it
never can take place between us.
Never,
Miss
Howard. Do not
say
never
Time
and
constant
assiduity
will I hope
influence your heart in my favour: for
without that
sweet
hope I
must
be
miserable
.
Indeed, Mr.
Rooksby
I cannot flatter
you. It is at
present
my fixed
determination
,
never to alter my condition: but were
that not the
case
Your choice would not fall on me. I
am
satisfied
Some more happy man.
Pardon me, you are in an error. I am
indifferent to all the
sex
.
Then why not allow me to
strive
to
awaken the
sensibility
of your heart.
Believe
me your
happiness
should
be the whole
study
of my life.
Mr.
Rooksby
, I will be explicit. Were
I ever
so
partial to your virtues, I could not
overlook one glaring error in your conduct,
an error which not only
tarnishes
your own
reputation, but preys upon your mother's
peace of mind.
You mean my connection with Clara.
I do.
Will you permit me,
Miss
Howard, to
enter into a little detail of my conduct
through the whole of this unhappy
connection
.
Unhappy! I
must
always call it, not
only from the
reasons
you have
just
alledged,
but
because
I
foresee
my want of fortitude
has involved an amiable woman in infamy
and ruin; for had I
repulsed
the
first
overtures
of the unhappy Clara's
passion
,
affronted
pride would have
assisted
in combating
her attachment, and
she
might at this
moment
have been happy in the
esteem
and
love of her
husband
and family. I have often
wished
to explain this affair to my mother
and engage her
friendship
in behalf of Clara,
but whenever I attempt to
speak
,
she
brands
the poor girl with the epithets of artful, vile,
enticing
siren
. Alas,
Miss
Howard, the
unfortunate
Clara's
greatest
error is, a too
tender attachment to me.
Ah man! man!
said
I mentally, how
easily
does thy vanity, dupe thy
reason
,
Mr.
Rooksby
continued
It may appear odd, that I
should
wish
to enter upon this
subject
to you, but I am
certain you will judge with candour and
represent
Clara to my mother in
such
a light
as may lead her to befriend a woman, who
has
sacrificed
fame,
happiness
, and honour to
me. You will
ask
, perhaps, why I do not
marry her, as her
husband
is lately dead,
I would
answer
, that
she
is not a woman
calculated to make me happy. Her temper
is impetuous, and though her form is lovely
and
she
has received a
polished
education,
she
possesses
not that true femenine
softness
and delicacy which in my opinion alone can
render a woman really amiable. My
acquaintance
with her commenced about four
years
since
, while I was completing my
studies
at Oxford. At that time her
husband
Mr. Millar was a
counsellor
residing
at that
city. He invited me frequently to his
house
.
I
saw
Mrs. Millar, and admired her as a
lovely
accomplished
woman; nay more, I
pitied her, for I
saw
she
was not happy.
Her
sister
,
Miss
Ramsay
, who
resided
in the
house
with her, told me, their father had
been a lieutenant in the navy: but age and
infirmities obliging him to retire upon his
half pay, they found their
circumstances
greatly
straitened
. At this time, Mr.
Millar
paid their father a
visit
. He was
struck
with the beauty and innocence of Clara,
and though at that time near fifty years old,
he had the vanity to think he could render
himself
agreeable to a girl of
seventeen
.
Perhaps,
said
I, it was a benevolent
wish
to lighten the expences of his friend
and place the young lady in a
state
of
independence
which urged him to make the
offer of his hand.
It might be
so
,
she
replied, but
whatever
his motives might be, gratitude and
filial love incited Clara to accept the offer,
and
sacrifice
herself
to the man
she
disliked
;
to
secure
ease
and affluence to her father
and
sister
: but he lived not long to enjoy
the fruits of her
kindness
. A
slow
decline
carried him off about a year after his
daughter's
marriage. At this time I was
introduced
into Mr. Millar's family. Clara was
just
become a mother; her
husband
seemed
to idolize her;
she
could not breathe a
wish
which was not
instantly
gratified. Yet
she
was far from happy, and I often
saw
her turn
aside
to conceal tears, which
seemed
to flow
from an
oppressed
heart. One afternoon,
Mr. Millar was from home, her
sister
sitting
at the other end of the room reading. Clara
rose
from her
seat
on pretence of reaching
something
from the chimney piece, and
stooping
, picked up a paper which
she
presented
to me,
saying
, you drop your letters
about very
carelessly
. I took the paper and
perceived it was a
sealed
letter. I will not
shock
your delicacy,
Miss
Howard, by
repeating
the contents of this letter. I can
perceive by your countenance, that you
think it a
sufficient
error for a married
woman
to entertain an inclination for any other
man than her
husband
without daring to
avow her
passion
. I am
sensible
, Clara acted
with imprudence; but who can
answer
for
the emotions of a heart, under the influence
of its
first
tender attachment? And however
culpable,
she
might be, I think
myself
more
so
. I
should
have never more entered Mr.
VOL. III. B
Millar's
house
, when I found how
detrimental
my
presence
was, both to his honour and
happiness
. I
should
have avoided the
society
of the fair
seducer
, and confined
myself
more than ever to my
studies
. I am
conscious
this
should
have been my conduct;
but, alas! it was quite the
reverse
. I
sought
every opportunity of being in her company.
I encouraged her growing
tenderness
.
Private
enterviews
ensued
, and honour,
gratitude
,
and
friendship
were all forgotten.
Though our
entercourse
continued, during
the whole time I remained at Oxford, Mr.
Millar never
suspected
his injuries. The
sister
was in our confidence, and
she
always
contrived our meetings in
such
a manner,
that they appeared the effect of chance.
Just
before I left Oxford, Clara was
confined
with her
second
child. This
prevented
my taking a
personal
leave. I wrote,
informing
her of the
necessity
of my removal,
assured
her of my grateful affection and that
I would take frequent opportunities of
visiting
her in future. This I
said
, merely to
quiet her anxiety; for
reason
had began to
operate; the
mist
of
passion
was
dissipated
and I was determined to put an end to a
connection
,
at once
so
dishonourable
and
unjust
.
I
chose
to take the opportunity of her
consinement
for my departure, as I knew how
ill I could
support
taking a
personal
leave,
where tears, faintings, and
hysterics
would
effectually unbend my
best
resolutions
. I
therefore
entrusted
my letter to the
sister
,
without-informing her of the contents, and
set
forward immediately for London. I had
not been in town above a fortnight, when
one morning, as I
sat
at
breakfast
, I heard
a
chaise
stop
at the door, and in a moment
Clara
rushed
into the parlour where I was
sitting
.
Good God,
said
I, Mrs. Millar what
has brought you to town.What,
she
replied, what but your cruel defertion of
me. Unkind, ungenerous
Rooksby
, did
you think I would live
separated
from you.
My dear Clara,,'
said
I,
consider
how
your reputation will
suffer
when this
rash
step
is knownWhat is reputation to
me, cried
she
, if I am deprived of your
love I
lose
all that can make life valuable.
Where are your children, Clara,
I left them too, for your
sake
,
Rooksby
;
and is this cold, unkind reception all the
return I am likely to meet.You call
me cold, and unkind; but believe me, you
wrong me, I feel all, nay much more than
I ought for you, but I am very
sorry
to find
you have
so
little regard for
yourself
as thus
to incur the
censure
of the world by
following
a man who has it not in his power to
offer you an honorable protection.You
throw me from you, then. You will not
receive me (cried
she
,
starting
up, and
wildly
clasping
her hands,) Oh
Rooksby
this
is more than I can bearI am
bursting
My heart is
swollen
so
large; it choaks me.
Be calm, I
beseech
you, my dear Clara,
I do not
refuse
to receive you; no, my poor
girl, I feel
myself
bound to protect you;
for I know it was I
first
drew you from your
duty; but I am
sensible
, how little
recompence
it is in my power to make for the
many comforts and
blessings
I have robbed
you of. Oh
Rooksby
,
said
she
, let
me enjoy your
society
, and be
blessed
with
your love, and I
shall
not regret any
sacrifice
I have made.
What could I do,
Miss
Howard,
continued
Mr.
Rooksby
.There was but one
way. I offered to take her a
house
a little
way out of town and
visit
her
occasionally
.
She acceded to the
proposal
and changed her
name. Soon after her
sister
came to town,
and with her brought the two children, whom
she
said
Mr. Millar had in his
resentment
turned out of doors.I now
considered
myself
as bound to provide for
these
unfortunate
children; but I had no idea of making
myself
a
resident
in the
same
house
with their
mother. But when I went over to France
this
last
autumn,
she
followed me, and with
such
earnestness
declared
she
would
sooner
die than be
separated
from me for one week,
that I was unable to
refuse
the
request
she
made to accompany me abroad. While we
were on the continent we heard from her
sister
, that Mr. Millar was dead.From that
time, Clara
earnestly
pressed
me to marry
her; but I told her not to form any
such
vain expectation, as that was an event, which
never could take place; however I
promised
always to be her friend, and in
consideration
of her then evident pregnancy,
consented
that on our return to England, I would take
a
house
in London and
reside
with her.
Alas! my dear young lady, I knew not what
inconveniencies I was bringing upon
myself
:
Her expences far outran the annual
sum
I had allotted her;
she
is never happy but
when I am with her, and even when I devote
almost
my whole time to her,
she
is
peevish
,
dissatisfied
and
constantly
complaining of my
altered carriage towards her. Alas, I know
I am changed; but I am
also
certain I never
failed in tender
solicitude
, and attention to
her welfare. I never did love her. Vanity,
gratitude
,
and the wild
impulses
of youth have
been
mistaken
for that
passion
. I am now
convinced
of my error. My heart now vibrates
with a true and ardent affection. I will never
suffer
Clara to know want; but the future
B 2
happiness
or
misery
of my life
must
depend
entirely upon
Miss
Howard.
I had
listened
attentively, during this
recital
.
I found much to blame in Clara.
Indeed
,
they had both been guilty of errors
of
such
magnitude, that in my opinion they
deserved
the appellation of crimes: but it
was not for me to condemn. I knew from
fatal experience, how imprudent were the
dictates of a youthful heart. And though
I felt a
secret
horror at the recital of
Rooksby's
cruel perfidy, to his kind,
unsuspecting
friend Mr. Millar, yet he appeared innocent
in
comparison
with Clara. Her
husband
loved her
almost
to adoration; he had
raised
her from poverty to affluence; he had
cheared
the
last
hours of her father, and offered
an
assylum
to her orphan
sister
. He was
the father of her children, Celia. Yet could
she
ungratefully betray the honour he had
confided to her care;
forsake
this kind,
indulgent
husband
,
desert
her innocent
children
,
in that
helpless
state
, when they require
all a mother's fond
solicitude
and anxious
maternal care.And for this inhuman
conduct
she
pleads love. Celia! real love
never
yet incited its votaries to
base
or
dishonourable
actions. I am certain, I never
could like Clara. She appears to me an
artful
designing
woman, and from
Rooksby's
account, I think,
interest
has been the
main
spring
of her actions. Indeed, that
alone urged her to follow him; for had
she
regarded him with real affection,
she
would
have
shrunk
from the idea of becoming a
burthen to him: and do not, my dear Celia,
think I am turning rigidly
censorious
, if I
say
, I
suspect
she
was not really the wife of
Mr. Millar; though that takes but little from
her guilt, as
she
certainly had received many
tokens of affection from him, and had been
received and
respected
as his wife by all the
families who lived in their neighbourhood.
All
these
reflections had
passed
rapidly thro'
my mind, while Mr.
Rooksby
was
speaking
.
When he
paused
, I found
myself
necessitated
to
answer
.
You
say
,
sir
, your heart is very
deceitful
:
it has once betrayed you into actions
and connections you now heartily repent.
May it not do
so
again.
Trust
not to its
impulse
: call in the aid of
reason
and
reflection
,
and you will find your
present
inclination
will prove as great a
delusion
as
the former.
Impossible
! he replied, vehemently,
impossible
, I can never alter my opinion in
regard to
Miss
Howard.
And believe me,
sir
,
said
I, gravely,
it is equally
impossible
I can ever alter
mine in regard to you.
I then attempted to leave the room; but
he caught my hand. Stay, my dear girl,
only one moment; let me intreat you, only
to recall that cruel word never. Give me
but the
most
distant
ray of hope and I will
endeavor to be
satisfied
.Well, Sir,
said
I
smiling
, if you remain of the
same
opinion you are now, forty years hence, I
will talk with you further on the
subject
.
He
released
my hand and turned from me
in
sullen
silence
. I embraced the
opportunity
,
and immediately quitted the
appartment
.
But here was a
fresh
scene
of
persecution
to encounter. Mrs.
Rooksby
met
me, as I went
across
the hall, and taking
hold of my arm, we walked into the garden.
I
see
, my dear Meriel,
said
she
, you are
not
pleased
; poor Clement has little to hope:
but come tell me, have you given him a
positive
refusal
?My dear Madam, you
already know my
sentiments
on that
subject
,
I have no inclination for matrimony, I
wish
to remain
single
; for I am certain I
should
never have patience
sufficient
to
submit
to
all the whims and caprices of
those
lords of
the creation. I am afraid Meriel, you
deceive
yourself
, and that under the idea of
a
disinclination
for marriage, you
nourish
a
hopeless
and
destructive
passion
. I know my
dear girl how nobly you have conducted
yourself
in regard to Mr. Kingly. My niece
has informed me of the whole: but my good
girl, while you are thus
studiously
promoting
the
happiness
of others, why neglect your
own, why
sacrifice
the bloom and
spring
of
life to a
passion
, which however well placed,
is now no longer innocent.
Oh! Madam, I replied, do not
suspect
me of
cherishing
so
improper a
desire
;
can I not be
suffered
to
pass
quietly through
the remainder of my life, without forming
any other connection than
friendship
? Why
must
I be obliged to undertake duties I am
so
very unable to perform? Or why do you
wish
a heart long
since
dead to
pleasure
,
from whom every tender tie is now
severed
,
to have its
sensibility
again awakened, to
have new affections; to make it again fond
of life, only perhaps to experience again the
acute pangs of
losing
the beloved objects that
had called
those
affections forth?My
dear Meriel, you
must
not argue thus; we
are all born to encounter trouble.Alas!
Madam, my
share
has already been
almost
beyond my weak power to
support
; for
from the day in which I left the Convent till
the
present
, I have not experienced one
so
happy that I could
wish
it to return, yet
heaven knows I do not complain; but I
wish
not to engage in new
scenes
.
You
must
consider
,
Miss
Howard, it
is not for us to mark out the path we
wish
to tread, and cry I will not deviate from it.
We are not
sent
into the world to
pass
thro'
it in indolence. Remember my love that
life which is not in
some
measure
serviceable
to our fellow-creatures, is not acceptable to
our Creator. You in particular are
sent
into
the world, endowed with abilities to
shine
in the
respective
characters of Wife, Mother,
and the
mistress
of a family, and will you
be the unprofitable
servant
and hide
those
talents
intrusted
to your care, for the
comfort
of your friends and the benefit of
mankind
in general
But Clara, madam. I hope you will
allow that is an
obstacle
?It is only
so
in your opinion: To me it is the great
motive
of my
earnest
wish
to
see
Clement
united
to youClara
shall
be amply provided
for
And her child?We will take it
home,
should
it be born alive, and I will
see
it
shall
be properly educated and a
handsome
provision
made for its future
support
. Now
my dear Meriel, I think all your objections
are removed. You
must
, dear madam,
give me time for
consideration
, before I can
determine on
so
important a
subject
.
You
shall
not be hurried, my love,
only
let me have your leave to bid Clement
hope.
Oh! do not I
beseech
you,
raise
fallacious
hopes. It may not be in my power
to realize them.Well then,
said
she
,
I will remain
silent
, till I have your leave
to
speak
. She then turned into another
walk and I returned to the
house
.And,
now my dear Celia, how would you
advise
me to act. I fear, turn which way I will, I
am
still
in an error. Ah! my
sweet
friend,
I cannot teach this
stubborn
heart
indifference
toward Kingly, and
sure
I am,
whilst
I remain
single
, my partiality will be ever
the
same
. Should I marry, other ties and
the important duties of my
station
will call
my mind from this dangerous object: But
then to give my hand and vow obedience
to a man, whom my heart
refuses
to love,
is certainly an error; and what is
worse
,
the irrevocable words, once
past
, there will
be no flying from my fate, however
repugnant
it may be to my feelings. I will write
to my dear Amelia on the
subject
;
also
to
to Mrs. Kingly. Their opinions
shall
decide
my fate. Yet, my dear Celia, believe
me, my
soul
shrinks
from an union with
Rooksby
. I know not why, but whenever
I think of it, a cold chill runs through
my veins, and my heart
sinks
within me:
but I am grown
strangely
fanciful of late.
I am greatly altered
since
we parted.
Methinks
,
I am but the
shadow
of my former
self
, the
serenity
of temper I once
boasted
to
enjoy is entirely
lost
, and I am like a
froward
child. Adieu, I am changed in every
thing but
friendship
to you.
MERIEL.

I have
wrote to my friends and received
their
answers
. Amelia
wishes
me to
accept
Mr.
Rooksby
's offer. She
says
it is
the only way to
restore
tranquility to my
heart. Mrs. Kingly
desires
me to
study
my
own
happiness
, but at the
same
time, I think
she
would rejoice in my union with her
cousin
.
But I will give you both their letters,
and you will better conceive how their
minds are inclined.
VOL. III. C
LETTER XLII.
MRS. KINGLY to MISS HOWARD.
Plymouth
,
June
4
th
, 1781.
You
tell me, my dear
Miss
Howard,
that my
cousin
has, to your
surprize
,
declared a
passion
for you: it is your
diffidence
alone
occasions
that
surprize
, as I
foresaw
it was a
circumstance
that would
certainly follow your
residing
in the
family
:
but, though my lovely friend, I
should
greatly rejoice to rank you in the number
of my relations, I would by no means
desire
that gratification, if it is to be
purchased
at the expence of your peace of mind.
Clement has, it is true, an independent
fortune
;
but his mind is not formed for the
approbation of one
so
delicate as yours. I
should
be
pleased
to
see
you
raised
to a
station
you was formed to adorn; but I
cannot
avoid the remembrance of your
gentleness
of
spirit
which
seeks
not in grandeur
for content. Oh! my dear Meriel, I know
there never was but one man worthy of
your affection, and I have
stepped
between
you and
happiness
.
I informed Mr. Kingly, as you
desired
,
of my
cousin
's offer. Her mind,
said
he,
must
be
strangely
altered, if
she
can find
the
least
congenial particle in his; but
she
is altogether an inexplicablee riddle. Vexed
to hear him
speak
so
slightingly
, I was
almost
tempted to betray my
trust
and tell
him how vilely you had
slandered
yourself
,
but
shall
I
confess
the truth,
self
-love
prevailed
.
I could not bear to think he might
perhaps be angry at my long concealment;
and much as I
esteem
and venerate my dear
Miss
Howard, I could not
consent
he
should
love even her, better than me. I will not
give my opinion concerning your future
conduct; though you
condescend
to
ask
it.
Of this I am
satisfied
, whatever your own
good
sense
shall
resolve
upon, that will
undoubtedly
be right. Accept my
best
wishes
for your
happiness
and
prosperity
, and
belive
you have not a
sincerer
friend than
M. KINGLY.
LETTER XLIII.
MISS SIDNEY to MISS HOWARD.
London
,
June
3
d
, 1781.
And
so
my little
sentimental
Meriel is
really and
seriously
deliberating,
whether
she
shall
accept a man with
seven
thousand
a year,
shine
forth in all the
magnificence
of bridal finery, or remaining a
chaste
vestal
, breathing pure vows to the
consecrated
flame of her
first
love, continue in a
state
of dependence to the end of her life.
I charge you,
Miss
Howard, deliberate no
longer. Make
haste
and
send
us
some
wedding
favours, and next winter, let me have
the
pleasure
of pointing out your elegant
equipage, as it
passes
my window, to
some
of my
inquisitive
acquaintance, and
saying
,
that is my friend Mrs.
Rooksby
's carriage.
Then how
shall
I exult to receive a
curtesy
from a
side
box when you are as fine as
hands can make you, and poor humble me
as plain as
possible
,
sit
almost
opposite
you
in the pit. In the pit you
say
,
bless
me
Amelia, I
should
blush
to death to be thought
to know any one in the pit. Pardon me,
dear Meriel, I know your good little heart
so
well, I am certain the friend you
esteemed
would always be recognized while
she
continued
deserving
of your notice, though
poverty and
distress
were
strongly
marked
by her appearance. And now to be
serious
concerning your letter, Mr.
Rooksby
appears
to me a weak young man; but there
seems
great
goodness
of heart in him and I
think it would be a charitable action to
snatch
him from ruin.for inevetable ruin
must
follow his connection with Clara. I
am informed her
stile
of living is the
most
extravagant immaginable, and
such
splendid
preparations are making for her
accouchment
,
that you would think her a
dutchess
of the
first
rank. And now I am
speaking
of charitable actions, let me
represent
to my
friend the many aching hearts it will be in
her power to relieve when
she
is
mistress
of
such
an ample fortune, as Mr.
Rooksby
offers
to her acceptance. And again, my
love,
consider
what a relief it will be to the
generous Mrs. Kingly to
see
you
so
well
settled
.
Even Kingly
himself
will be happier
when you are married, for
trust
me while
you remain
single
he will
nourish
the idea
that your partiality for him is the
occasion
C 2
of your preferring a
state
of celibacy.
That you will be happier in
yourself
, I am
well convinced. New
scenes
will open to
your imagination,
past
sorrows
will be
forgotten
and the afflictions of the daughter
shall
be amply repaid by the felicity of the
mother. Ah! my dear Meriel, you
must
marry, if it be only to experience the
superlative
happiness
of having a daughter,
whose
soul
shall
be the exact model of your
own. Methinks too, my friend, you will
feel your
bosom
dilate with
pleasure
, when
you can call Mrs.
Rooksby
by the endearing
name of mother. A heart like yours,
so
formed for all the endearing ties of life when
deprived of its natural relation,
seeks
some
one on whom to
rest
its affection. Accept
then my dear girl, the offered good that
awaits you, let your heart expand to receive
all
those
delightful
sensations
which
result
from a felicitous matrimonial union, and
while you are alternately
addressed
by the
endearing titles of mother and daughter;
while the man whom you
shall
bless
with
your hand, reveres, admires, adores you,
the
disappointments
of your youth
shall
be
no more remembered, except it is with a
kind of
smiling
wonder at their ever having
made you
uneasy
. My mother bids me tell
you
she
wishes
you may be as truly happy
as you
deserve
, and you will then be
superlatively
so
and
so
says
your
AMELIA SIDNEY.
MERIEL to CELIA.
IN CONTINUATION.
When
I had read
these
letters, my
mind
still
wavering and
irresolute
, I
repaired to Mrs.
Rooksby
's
dressing
room.
I found her weeping. Meriel,
said
she
,
as I entered, you are come in good time
to comfort me. Clement has
just
been with
me. He leaves us to-morrow.
To-morrow, Madam, that is much
sooner
than he at
first
intended.
Yes, Meriel, and he leaves us with an
intention that
almost
deprives me of
reason
.
You
surprize
me, what intention can
he have formed, that gives you
so
much
anxiety.
He is determined to marry Clara
immediately
on his arrival in London, that
his child may be legetimated.
Marry Clara,
said
I, with an emotion
of
astonishment
.
It is even
so
my dear; he
just
now told
me he found it was in vain to hope any
thing from you, and being deprived of
the hope of your affection he knew love
could have no part in any other union, he
was determined that the claims of honour
should
be attended to, and his innocent
child have not future
cause
to
curse
the
author
of its being,
since
that being would,
if he did not marry Clara, inherit infamy
as its birth-right.
I cannot think, I replied, that
honour
by any means obliges him to marry that
woman. She certainly forfeited all claim
to an honourable protector, when
she
fled
from Mr. Millar. I
wish
she
was well
provided
for, and far from Mr.
Rooksby
, for
I am cartain that inevitable
misery
and ruin
must
ensue
from a continuation of his
present
connection with her. What then
would bethe
consequence
of an
indissoluble
union? I tremble to think of it.
You will
see
him,
Miss
Howard, before
he leaves Oak-hall. Let me beg of you,
my dear girl, to exert all your eloquence,
to
persuade
him from
so
fatal a
step
. Give
some
hope, even if it
should
be but
fallacious
,
and I make no doubt, but we
shall
retain him with us a little time longer, and
who knows what time may do.
I cannot deceive any
person
, my dear
madam. If I am tempted to hold out hope
to draw your
son
from this
destructive
resolution
,
be
assured
, I
shall
one day mean to realize
them.
Blessings
on you my
sweet
Meriel, you will then relent; I
shall
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
my
son
preserved
from ruin, and obtain a daughter who
must
be admired and
esteemed
by all, who are
so
happy as to know her.
I did not
absolutely
say
so
, madam. I
will
see
Mr.
Rooksby
previous to his
intended
departure. I will
use
every argument in
my power to prevail with him to give up his
design
in regard to Clara; if I find every
other argument ineffectual, I will
promise
some
future day to give him my hand. But
let me
request
my dear friendly Mrs.
Rooksby
to attribute this
resolution
to its proper
cause
.
I will not deceive your
son
with
professions
of affection which I do not feel. I have
received
many favours from you and your
amiable niece Mrs. Kingly, and I think it
will be to your mutual
satisfaction
, to
see
me
married. I am
sensible
, it is a duty
also
which I owe
myself
, as,
whilst
I continue
single
, I
shall
always be
suspected
of
nourishing
an improper affection for Mr. Kingly,
and as it is my
earnest
wish
to
preserve
my
own reputation unfullied and to promote as
much as
possible
the
happiness
of others, I
will unite
myself
to Mr.
Rooksby
, but alas,
I have nothing to offer in return for his
generous
affection but
esteem
and
friendship
.
Enough my love, cried Mrs.
Rooksby
embracing me, I have no doubt of
Clement's
happiness
, when
blest
with the
esteem
of
so
amiable a companion.
At dinner we all met as
usual
. Mr.
Rooksby
was in his travelling
dress
. Are you for
riding this afternoon,
sir
,
said
II think
of
setting
forward for London,
Miss
Howard,
I have an affair of infinite
consequence
to
transact
there, and I fear delays may be
dangerous
.You
must
not leave us to-night,
however, Clement,
said
his mother
smiling
.
I did not
understand
you intended
leaving
Oak-hall till to-morrow,
said
I.I
would willingly
stay
here for ever, he replied,
but I am
sensible
my
presence
is
detrimental
to the tranquility of one
whose
happiness
I would promote at the hazard of my life.
This was a compliment, my dear Celia,
which I could not take entirely to
myself
, as
he might have meant Clara's
happiness
was
disturbed
by his remaining at Oak-hall, I
therefore remained
silent
, and little more
was
said
, till the cloth was removed. I then
arose
to leave the room with Mrs.
Rooksby
,
who generally retires to her
dressing
room
after dinner, and as if often the
case
with
elderly people, indulges
herself
with a nap.
As I
arose
Mr.
Rooksby
took my hand.
Permit me,
Miss
Howard, before I take my
leave to
request
the honour of a few minutes
conversation
. I
curtesied
assent
and
reassumed
my
seat
; he continued.
It is with infinite regret, my dear
young lady, that I leave this place, as by
so
doing I
relinquish
every hope, which I had
fondly
cherished
of obtaining an
interest
in
your
bosom
. I
see
my
presence
is painful
to you, it encroaches on that tranquillity you
would
otherwise
enjoy, in a place
so
agreeable
to your
disposition
. I hope you will
believe, your
happiness
is an object of far
greater moment to me than my own. I go
from hence with a fixed
resolution
to repair
the injuries I have done Clara; but to
convince
you how near your
interest
is and ever
will be to my heart, I
must
beg you will
consider
yourself
from this moment
independent
.
In this (
presenting
me a
small
box)
you will find a writing, which conveys to
you and yours for ever an
estate
worth
two hundred pounds a year,
situated
in
Glamorganshire
. I will not be either
interrupted
or contradicted (
seeing
I was about
to
speak
.) You
must
accept this as from a
brother, who though his own future days
will have
scarce
a dawn of
pleasure
to
enliven
them, will always have the comfort of
reflecting the
most
amiable woman in the
world will be no more reduced to
situations
at once
so
unworthy her merits, and
painful to her feelings.
Overcome by this generous conduct I was
unable to
speak
. Tears involuntarily
burst
from my eyes and
seeing
him about to leave
the room,
almost
unknowing what I did, I
caught his hand to detain him.
Do not
distress
me, my dear
Miss
Howard
,
said
he,
those
tears are too precious to
be
shed
on
such
a trivial
occasion
.
Trivial,
said
I, Oh! Mr.
Rooksby
,
I cannot accept this noble donation. It
oppresses
me beyond
measure
. I have no way
of
discharging
the
vast
debt of gratitude.
My
sweet
girl,
said
he,
kissing
my
hand. Remember me ever with a
friendly
affection and I
shall
think
myself
a
thousand
times repaid.
I cannot take it,
sir
, indeed I cannot.
But let me prefer one
request
to you. Do
not leave us this afternoon, remain a few
days longer to oblige me.
No, my dear Meriel, I
see
the generous
drift of your
design
. You pity me, you
wish
to make me happy and to oblige my
mother would
sacrifice
your own felicity;
but, my dear friend, if I have nothing to
hope from affection, I will not be indebted
to gratitude or
compassion
.
But, dear Mr.
Rooksby
,
consider
how
you will
distress
your mother by thus
precipitately
giving your hand to Mrs. Millar;
You
must
pardon me,
sir
, but indeed I do
not think her altogether worthy
such
an
honour.
Such a
severe
expression
from
miss
Howard is
something
extraordinary; but
vol. iii. D
women (added he
smiling
) are not always
the
most
candid judges of each other. You
my dear
Miss
behold in Clara only a frail
woman, who forgetful of the rigid dictates
of honour and virtue
sacrificed
reputation,
friends, every valuable
consideration
to an
unhappy
passion
. I behold her as a lovely,
unfortunate creature, who has made
those
sacrifices
for me. I
also
consider
that,
perhaps
,
had it been her fate to be united to the
man of her heart,
she
would at this moment
have been a
respectable
member of
society
;
and if I reflect, that I only am the
cause
,
that
she
is not
so
, can I do
otherwise
than
repair as much, as is in my power, the
injuries
her reputation has
suffered
on my
account
.
I think, Mr.
Rooksby
, you argue
perfectly
right, nor
should
I have entered on
this
subject
, had it not been at the
earnest
request
of your mother. She
shudders
at
the idea of your introducing into the family
a woman of light fame. She has been
informed
that Mrs. Millar is a very faulty
woman
in more
respects
than one. She
wishes
to have her amply provided for, but cannot
endure to think
she
must
be the wife of her
darling
son
.
I
saw
,
Miss
Howard, from the
first
that
it was at my mother's
desire
you
so
chearfully
assented
to this
conversation
. She knew
the
generosity
of your
disposition
. She
naturally
supposed
you would exert
yourself
to
prevail with me to
relinquish
my
design
. She
foresaw
the generous
concessions
you would
make in my favour: but
she
knows not the
heart of her
son
, if
she
imagines affection
like his could be
satisfied
with any thing
less
than affection in return.
I am
sorry
, I
shall
be able to give no
better
account of my undertaking; but,
however
,
Mr.
Rooksby
, permit me to decline,
this obligation (returning the writings). I
am perfectly
satisfied
with my
situation
in
your mother's family, and
must
insist
on
your receiving this again.
He
refused
to take it. I laid it on the
table and
hastily
left the room.
So you
see
, my dear Celia, while I was
consulting
my friends whether I
should
accept
or reject this man, he has
hastily
formed
the
resolution
of leaving me to wear the
willow and
bestowing
himself
on another.
Seriously
my friend I feel
myself
greatly
obliged by the delicate manner in which he
declined accepting a hand when he was
certain
the heart would not immediately follow,
and were it not that I fear he will be
extremely
unhappy in an union with Clara, I
should
rejoice in being
released
from his
importunities
.
Mrs.
Rooksby
is in great
affliction
.
I try all I can to comfort her; but
I really believe
she
will feel as much, when
she
fees her
son
mount his
horse
to leave the
Hall, as
she
would were
she
attending him
to the
silent
receptacle of his
ancestors
.
When this dreaded wedding is over
she
will,
I make no doubt, feel
easier
, and the birth
of her grandchild will naturally awaken
some
degree of affection towards its
mother
.
You will, perhaps, my dear Celia, blame,
me for
so
obstinately
refusing
Mr.
Rooksby
's
generous
present
; but my dear girl I am the
worst
in the world to receive an obligation.
It
oppresses
me; it
sinks
me to the earth,
especially
when I have no power to return
it. While I have my health, I have no
doubt of always finding a
situation
, where
I may render
myself
in
some
measure
useful
,
in return for my
subsistence
, and
should
sickness
, age or any infirmity, to which
mortality
is
subject
, overtake me,
whilst
I
remain
in what is generally termed an
unprotected
state
, I have
still
the
same
beneficent
Providence to rely on, who never yet
suffered
me to
sink
under affliction.
Adieu my friend,
MERIEL.
LETTER XLII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Oak-hall
,
August
12th, 1781.
We
have had fine
bustling
and
confusion
I
assure
you, my dear Celia,
since
I wrote you
last
; and if you knew all,
you would
say
, we are likely to have much
more,but not to go on with my
intelligence
too
fast
.
The morning after I concluded my
last
,
Mr.
Rooksby
set
off for London. His
mother
D 2
would not take leave of him at his
departure
,
and I was obliged to
consent
that a
correspondence
should
be commenced
between
us; for
she
had
absolutely
declared
all
intercourse
with her
must
cease
, from
the moment he married Clara. Accordingly
on the fourth day after his departure I
received
a letter, informing me he had arrived
too late for his
purpose
: for Clara had been
in bed two days, and little
master
was as
fine a boy as ever was
seen
, and in perfect
health. Mrs.
Rooksby
greatly rejoiced, that
any thing had happened to
postpone
the
wedding, and flattered
herself
the
connection
would by
some
means or other be
broke off. It was near
six
weeks before we
had any farther tidings of him, though I had
answered
his letter immediately. It was at
the
close
of evening; Mrs.
Rooksby
was
reclined
on a
sopha
; for the weather was
extremely
hot, and I was playing on the
harpsichord
which I accompanied with my voice.
The evening was remarkably
still
, the moon
with
silver
crescent
saintly
illumined the
sky
,
encreasing
the beauty of the night by
her
presence
, without
eclipsing
by too much
radience the
lesser
glories of the
stars
. I had
just
begun that charming
song
from Milton's
Penseroso
.
Sweet bird that
shun
'
st
the
noise
of folly,
When we were interrupted by the
sound
of
horses
coming up the avenue, and in a
few minutes Mr.
Rooksby
rushed
into the
room, pale and to all appearance worn out
with fatigue. He
spoke
not at entering, but
throwing
himself
into his mother's arms,
burst
into tears.
Clement,
said
she
, my dear Clement
what is the matter. Good God! you weep,
your hands are hot. You are very ill.
Oh! mother, he replied, forgive me.
I know it is unlike a man, but the
shock
I
have received.Is Clara dead then,
said
she
.Clara, did you
say
, Oh the
siren
,
name her not, I cannot
trust
myself
to
speak
of her,
she
isbut come we will not
talk about her.
You come upon us rather unexpected,
said
I, advancing towards him.
I came,
said
he, as
fast
as a
repeated
change of
horses
would bring me,
for I knew there was no other place, where
I could find comfort. You, my dear
Miss
Howard will comfort me, and you will
prevail
with my mother, to receive under her
protecting roof
some
poor little orphans who
will arrive to-morrow to claim her care.
You are
sensible
, Clement, that every
child of affliction is welcome to me. I will
protect and
serve
them to the
utmost
of my
power. How much greater then will be
their claim on my humanity, when they
come recommended by you.
And when one of them is my child,
cried he vehemently,my dear mother,
that woman, whom I had intended to make
my wifebut no matter,
she
is gone. She
has
forsaken
her poor little innocents; but
I will not
suffer
them to know want.
You are not married then?No
Thank heaven, my dear Clement, thank
heaven, your honour will not
suffer
by this
cruel defertion, and let the vile mother go,
we will protect the unoffending children.
After
supper
, Mr.
Rooksby
was more
composed
. He told us, that on his arrival
in London he
hastened
to Clara and found
her as he had informed us, the mother of a
fine boy and likely to do well. He told her
with what intention he had hurried to town,
and
said
, if
she
desired
it, a
special
licence
should
be procured and the ceremony
performed
in her own chamber. This
she
fortunately
refused
alledging, that, as her
disgrace
had been public,
she
desired
the
reparation
might be public
also
. To this he
assented
and preparations were making for the
public performance of the ceremony. He
had
presented
her with a magnificent
set
of
jewels, and with money to the amount of
three
thousand
pounds. A day was
appointed
for the union: the articles,
settlements
,
&c. were all ready for
signing
: When the
evening preceding the appointed morning
he called at her
house
and was informed
she
was gone to a private ball
some
few miles
out of town. He thought it
somewhat
strange
, but knowing the volatility of her
disposition
and how extremely fond of every
thing that wore the
semblance
of
pleasure
,
it did not
so
much
surprize
him. The next
morning he repaired to her at the time
appointed
,
a new equipage,
servants
in new
liveries with white and
silver
favours arrived
at the door. The
guests
began to appear
when enquiries were made for the bride.
Mr.
Rooksby
went up to
hasten
her. She
was not in her
dressing
-room. He called for
her woman:
she
was not to be found. At
length a groom ventured, trembling into
the
presence
of the
disappointed
, enraged
bridegroom and delivered him a
sealed
billet.
He broke the
seal
with precipitation: it
contained
these
words:
TO MR. ROOKSBY.
You thought to have deceived me, but
you are
mistaken
. I have been informed of
all your late
dishonourable
conduct. Would
your mother's humble companion have
accepted
your hand, it would never have been
offered to me: but though you have been
a dupe to me I will not become one to you.
I know, you will, at the reception of this,
rave and
curse
your evil genius which has
induced you to make
yourself
the laughing
stock
of your acquaintance. I am far
beyond
the reach of your revenge, and enjoy
in idea, the ridiculous figure you will, at the
moment you are reading this appear,
surrounded
by your friends decked in the
trappings
of nuptial finery and
deserted
by the
intended bride. I have left the brats.
They would have been
troublesome
on the
long journey I mean to take; you may
either provide for them or
send
them to the
work-
house
; either way will be equally
agreeable
to me. I have accepted the
protection
of a noble lover, and mean to make
with him the tour of Europe. You
must
now offer
yourself
again to
Miss
Howard,
and I
wish
she
may
serve
you as I have done.
CLARA.
It is
easy
to conceive the
passion
this
infamous
scrawl
created in the
bosom
of
Rooksby
. He was in the
first
paroxysms
of
rage for putting an immediate period to his
existence
. Shame, vexation, and
disappointment
drove him to the verge of
distraction
.
At length he recollected the child
of whom he is extremely fond. He called
for it, declared that the mother's guilt
should
never be revenged on her innocent offspring,
and in
caressing
the little cherub, in
some
measure
composed
the perturbation of his
spirits
. The company
dispersed
, he
sent
away his chariot, and returned to his lodging
in a hackney-coach, where he
undressed
and
ordering
post
horses
,
set
forward
immediately
for Oak-hall, leaving his own man to
follow with the
nurse
and children. The
eldest
, who is a girl, I am told is at
school
in a village near Oxford, where Mr.
Rooksky
has every
reason
to be
satisfied
with the care taken of her education and
morals. He means, he
says
, that
she
shall
have a
useful
education, and will
settle
on her
a
thousand
pounds, the
interest
of which is
to be appropriated to her
support
. The
two boys, he will bring up together and by
a liberal education fit them for one of the
genteel
professions
, the choice of which
shall
remain with
themselves
. To them
also
he will give a
thousand
pounds each; but
they are both to be called by the name of
Millar. This is certainly a noble
spirited
young man. It is a pity he has not more
firmness
of temper; but he is as weak as an
infant and as
easily
persuaded
by
persons
who rightly
understand
his
disposition
.
Awaken
his gratitude or make a claim upon his
honour, and you may lead him as you
please
. This is far from the kind of
temper
that I like. Were I ever
so
much
attached
to Mr.
Rooksby
, I
should
be afraid
of
professing
it,
least
it
should
be
supposed
I meant to take an undue advantage of his
easy
nature, and I
should
, if married to
such
a man, avoid
shewing
a
thousand
little
kindnesses
,
least
I
should
seem
to demand more
than
similar
attentions from him. There is
another trait in his character, which I have
lately
discovered
. He is vain and rather
addicted to
jealousy
; and I can perceive
there is no part of Clara's conduct hurts him
more
severely
, than finding her
so
totally
indifferent
and
when he imagined her
strongly
attached to
himself
, to know her capable
of eloping with another.
And yet, my dear Celia, this very man
with all his errors, they have
some
how
or other among them drawn me into a
sort
of
promise
to marry. Mrs. Kingly wrote
and my dear Amelia wrote too.Mrs.
Rooksby
pleaded, and Clement
himself
,
looked
such
eloquent things, that what with
the grateful remembrance of his
generosity
,
toward me, which I forgot to tell you his
mother
insisted
on my accepting, and a
sort
of pity for his late
disappointment
, I
experienced
a kind of
sentiment
which I know
not how to
distinguish
. It is more lively
than
esteem
, and yet I am
sure
it is not
love. However, be it what it may, the die
is
cast
, and I believe
Rooksby
will be the
man with whom I am
destined
to
pass
my
life. The
settlements
, &c. prepared for
Clara, his mother declares
shall
remain for
me, as blanks had been left for the names.
I do not agree to this point; as I think the
settlement
by far too large. I think it very
necessary
a proper
provision
should
be made
in
case
of a large family, but as I have no
fortune, it would be
unjust
as well as
ungerous
to accept a
settlement
of
seven
hundred
a year. This I am
resolved
to over rule.
Three hundred will be more than
sufficient
.
On this condition alone, will I give him my
hand, for it
shall
never be
said
the poor
Meriel Howard aggrandized
herself
at the
expence of the
Rooksby
family. For here are
ill natured people in all families and no doubt
many of Mr.
Rooksby
's relations will think
themselves
degraded by this alliance.
VOL. III. E
In about a month from this time, my dear
friend, my fate will be decided. Contrary
to my inclination, the old lady will have a
public wedding, and all the family to the
third and fourth generation are to be invited.
The old
mansion
is put into
such
a
commotion
:
here is
such
fitting up and pulling
down, with
such
wife and
busy
faces, popping
about from one apartment to another,
while I, who am the
cause
of all the
confusion
,
am as calm and
composed
as
possible
.
At
least
, my countenance and demeanor
say
so
; but I have many
serious
thoughts, and
many a tear and many a
sigh
is given to the
memory of the time when I looked forward
to the nuptial hour with different
sensations
;
but that
must
be forgotten. My dear Celia,
pray for for your
MERIEL.
LETTER XLIII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Oak-hall
,
Sept.
20
th
, 1781.
It
is
past
, my friendand I am now the
wife of Mr.
Rooksby
. It is
just
a week,
since
at the altar, I pledged my faith to love
and honour him to the
latest
period of his
existence
. Well Celia, I will keep this
vow
most
religiously
; at
least
I will
esteem
him and love no other, and
whilst
his
conduct
is
such
as demands honour, I will
honour
him. Should he ever fail in any of
the grand moral duties, I will bear it with
meekness
, pity him and endeavour to
reclaim
him. I will be a faithful wife in every
sense
of the word.
The day on which I gave him my hand,
was indeed to me a tremendous one.
Kingly was
present
, nay he even gave me to
his
cousin
. I trembled when he took my
hand, a
saint
sickish
sensation
come over
me: but I rallied my
spirits
and went through
the ceremony tolerably well. My dear
Amelia
,
whom you might
suppose
would be
present
on this important
occasion
, kept up
my
spirits
during the
rest
of the day. Mrs.
Kingly looked happy, but it was a kind of
satisfaction
tempered with fear.I hope
said
she
,
pressing
my hand, I hope the
ra of your felicity may be dated from this
propitious day.
Most
certainly it will,
cried Amelia, for who ever heard of
misery
in a coach and
six
.Oh! replied
Mrs. Kingly, with great energy, there is
much greater
misery
in them than
those
who
lack the goods of fortune will readily
imagine
,
aye, my dear
Miss
Sidney, and the
worst
kind of
misery
too,
such
as wealth
cannot relieve or grandeur alleviate.
Well,
said
Amelia, laughing, I declare
we have
chosen
a brilliant topic for a wedding
day, but pray let us change it. I was
always
more inclined to become a
disciple
of
the laughing, rather than the weeping
philosopher
.
When it drew near dinner time and I
found I
must
descend
into the drawing
room, I trembled from the idea of being
presented
to about half a hundred
strangers
,
who would compliment, and
criticise
at a
most
unmerciful rate; the one to my face,
the other behind my back, and believe me
I would
sooner
listen
to the latter than the
former: for compliments have in general
little or no meaning and of
course
are mere
insipid
trifles. Now in
listening
to the
criticisms
of our friendly neighbours, who
perhaps did not intend we
should
over hear
them, we
discover
our faults, and may learn
how to amend them; but the misfortune is,
few will take the trouble to point out our
errors to us, while every one is ready to
flatter our
self
love, by commending us for
qualifications to which we have little or no
pretensions
, and, if they think, we believe
their
assertions
, the moment we quit them
they will laugh at our credulity. Well!
my dear Celia, I never could bring
myself
to make compliments, or fine
speeches
to
people, whom I did not think
deserved
them.
But to return to my
subject
I got through the day tolerably well, and
now our
guests
begin to think of returning
to their
respective
homes. It is
proposed
,
that we
stay
at Oak-hall till the latter end of
November. Mrs.
Rooksby
has prevailed
on Mrs. Sidney to remain with her, during
the winter, while Amelia accompanies me
to town. I am
vastly
pleased
with the
arrangement
,
as the
society
of that dear girl
E 2
will be a great comfort to me. I find
Rooksby
has given orders for a
house
to be fitted
up in a
stile
of the
utmost
elegance, as he
intends we
shall
always
pass
the winters in
town and the
summers
with his mother at
the Hall. He talks of much grandeur and
gaity. I am
sorry
for it, I think his
taste
very
expensive
; but it is not my place to
speak
. I am determined to regulate my own
expences, by the
strict
rule of economy, void
of
parsimony
. Even was the wealth my
own, I have no right to
squander
it away in
unnecessary
trifles, and as it is not, I
must
be
still
more careful. My allowance for
pocket money, cards, &c. is extremely
liberal
,
and I hope always to order it in
such
a manner as to have a
sufficient
sum
by me,
to
assist
depressed
merit, or
rescue
suffering
innocence from
oppression
. I hope, my dear
Celia, elevated as my
present
situation
is,
I
shall
never forget the
useful
lessons
taught
me in the
school
of
adversity
; and
surely
,
whilst
the remembrance of my own
sufferings
are retained, my heart will never be rendered
callous to the
sufferings
of others. Oh! my
beloved friend, dearly indeed
should
I
purchase
the
smiles
of fortune, if I am to
lose
my humanity. Benificent Ruler of the
Universe
, teach me to value the
blessings
bountifully
showered
upon me, by
constantly
remembering my own
deserts
; and
whenever I meet an afflicted fellow-creature,
let my heart
shew
its gratitude to Thee, by
dropping the tear of
sympathy
, and granting
the tribute of relief.I am certain,
Celia, they who have never known
adversity
,
cannot truly enjoy
prosperity
. I forgot
to tell you, that Kingly left us the day after
we were married. Mrs. Kingly
stays
, till we
all go to London. When we are
settled
there, I will write you again; but you
must
not expect any great variety in my letters;
I
must
, I
suppose
, at
first
enter into the
gaities
of the metropolis, but I am determined
not to be
so
infatuated as to give up my
whole time to them. I will have my hours
of peace and retirement: for in my opinion
the life that is
spent
in a continued round of
insipid
pleasures
, is not only entirely
useless
to
society
, but in
some
measure
guilty, as
we can have no time for the performance of
those
duties, which are incumbent on every
professor
of
Christianity
; nor do I think
as many do, that people of a certain rank
in life may
pass
their time in any way
most
agreeable to
themselves
, and that they
are not accountable for it to any one. We
certainly are
answerable
to one, who will
demand an account of our
stewardship
at a
time, when no
evasion
whatever will
serve
our turn: and the more elevated our
station
,
the more careful we
should
be to
set
examples worthy the imitation of our
inferiors. Examples that may
inspire
all,
who know us with a love of virtue, be an
honour to
ourselves
, and a benefit to
society
in general.
Mr.
Rooksby
asked
me, to whom I was
writing. To the friend of my early days,
I replied. We were educated in the
same
convent.
Miss
Shelburne
chose
to take the
veilI was of a different religion, and have
been called into the
busy
scenes
of life, but
the affections of our youth are always
remembered
with peculiar
pleasure
;
especially
,
when
reason
approves the election our
hearts had made in the days of childhood.
I am certain, my dear Meriel,
said
he,
she
must
be amiable, or
she
would not be
honoured
with your
esteem
.
You are a flatterer,
said
, I
smiling
, but if
you knew Celia half
so
well as I do, you
would know
she
was worthy of the love of
every good heart. I will not repeat his
reply
,
my friend, as it would favour too
much of vanity, if he is as gallant and
tender
twelve months hence, I may perhaps,
stand
a good chance for claiming the
flitch
of bacon
. He bids me
present
his
best
wishes
to you. Amelia
also
requests
to be
remembered
;
but it is
impossible
that either
of them can love and
esteem
you with the
tenderness
and
sincerity
of
MERIEL.
LETTER XLIV.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Harley St.
Dec.
19
th
, 1781.
I have
been in town above a week; but
could not command an hour to devote
to
friendship
and Celia. Indeed, I have
been
so
taken up with mantua-makers,
milliners
and toymen, I hardly know what
account
to give of the
last
seven
days; then
what with here and there a particular friend,
who
requested
to be admitted, before my
appearance at court gave the
signal
for the
whole town to come and
pass
their opinion
on my
house
-furniture, &c. I have been
wearied to death with a
constant
succession
of impertinant
visitors
, who are thus over
polite, for no other
reason
than the eager
desire
they have to report the
discoveries
they
make in regard to my
person
,
dress
and
manner, to the whole circle of their
acquaintance
;
but in this they have been
sadly
disappointed
,
for I have received them all in
a
small
back drawing-room, and have never
yet varied my
dress
from a neat
dishabille
.
I am now
summoned
to the drawing
room:
some
new
set
of
inquisitives
, I
suppose
,
well, I
must
attend; for people of
fashion
live not for
themselves
, but others.
They are afraid to perform any action, if
unfashionable
, though ever
so
right,
least
they
should
be laughed at: and for the very
same
cause
dare not
refuse
to do any thing to
which
fashion
gives a
sanction
, though
reason
tells them it is wrong, and
should
be
avoided.
I
must
leave you Celia.
And who do you imagine my
visitors
were?
Now would I venture to lay a
considerable
wager, your mind would glance over the
whole circle of my acquaintance, without
being able to
guess
the right. So to
save
you the trouble of conjecture, I will at once
inform you. They were no other than my
kind aunt
Mossopand
her two amiable
daughters
.
I do declare, Celia, when I
saw
them
in the drawing room I
absolutely
blushed
for
them. However, they did not
seem
to
experience
any
embarrassment
; but paid their
compliments with the
same
easy
air, as if
nothing had ever interrupted our intimacy;
only with this difference, their language and
manner was more
respectful
.
You have been very
sly
, my dear,
said
my aunt, never to let us know where you
were all this time, and then to blaze upon
us all at once a
splendid
bride.
I thought, madam, after the death of
my father, you would feel but little
interested
about the fate of his daughter, for
whom you never appeared to have any great
degree of partiality.
Bless
me, Mrs.
Rooksby
, you are
vastly
mistaken
. I was always extremely partial
to you, and I am
sure
Hester
and
Susan
have
talked of you many times,
since
last
we had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you. We wondered
what had become of you.
I have
seen
a variety of
scenes
,
said
I,
nor would it have been in the
least
probable
should
meet with
so
advantageous a
settlement
as I have, had it not been for the
friendship
of a young lady, whom I have
once or twice
seen
at your
house
, and who
at
present
does me the honour to make one
of my family. I then rang the bell, and
desired
the
servant
to inform
Miss
Sidney
we
requested
the favour of her company.
I
saw
my
cousins
look at each other when
Amelia's name was mentioned, Mrs.
Mossop
changed countenance.
Bless
me,
said
Hester
,
I was thinking of
Miss
Sidney, the other
day: but we have been in town
so
very
little
while, we have
seen
nobodythis is
positively
the
first
visit
we have made. When
Amelia entered the room, I
saw
she
was
astonished
: I
also
saw
the
constraint
and
confusion
which my
visitors
vainly
endeavoured
to hide under the
mask
of extreme
pleasure
at the accidental meeting.
However
,
as I imagined, my
cousins
courted my
notice merely in the hope of
sometimes
being
of my parties, and throwing
themselves
in the way of men of rank and
fortune
,
I gave them a general invitation
to my
house
, and I
sincerely
wish
the event
may
answer
their
sanguine
expectations, as
it would give me great
satisfaction
to
see
them married to worthy men,
possessed
of
fortunes capable of
supporting
them in the
manner to which they have been
accustomed
,
and which I fear they could not continue,
was their father to die before they are
settled
;
as he could not leave them a large
fortune, having in general lived up to the
extent of his income. Young
Mossop
is, I
find, in the
West
-Indies.Is it not
strange
,
my dear Celia, that I have heard nothing of
my brother
these
two years
past
. However
he has forgot me. I often think of him; I
pray for his health and
prosperity
, and
should
rejoice to
see
him return with an
independence
sufficient
to place him in a
respectable
situation
.Oh Celia, this continual
round of
visitors
, by no means
suits
the
taste
of your friend. I am called away again.
MERIEL.

[1]
Between this and the preceding letter,
several
are omited, as they contained only the common
events of life. During this time Mrs.
Rooksby
informs
her friend
she
is become the mother of a
daughter
.
The reader may therefore
suppose
, more than a
year and a half has
clapsed
,
since
the marriage of our
heroine.
MERIEL to CEILA.
Oak-hall
,
June
10
th
, 1783.
My
little Clementina, is grown the
finest
girl you can imagine; and I
assure
you, grandmamma is not a little
proud of her darling. I
wished
the dear
little charmer to have been called Frederica,
but I dared not
say
so
,
least
it
should
be
thought improper.
Last
night, my dear
Amelia arrived: her
spirits
are greatly
depressed
by the death of her excellent mother,
but as
she
will be happy in the
friendship
and protection of Mrs.
Rooksby
, I hope
soon
to
see
her
chearfulness
restored
. I have
got
such
a habit of
seizing
every
leisure
moment to
scribble
to my Celia, that I often
take up my pen, when I have really nothing
to
say
. You rejoice, you tell me to find my
happiness
increase
. Indeed, my dear friend
I experience a much larger
share
than
some
years
since
, I could have imagined would
have ever fallen to my lot. Mr.
Rooksby
is
still
the kind, the attentive
husband
, and
the birth of my little girl
seems
more
strongly
to cement our union.
You cannot think, how
surprised
I was
a few days before we left town. Mr.
Rooksby
had been out in the morning, and on
his return told me he had met with an old
friend whom he had invited home to
dinner
.
He is a man,
said
he, with whom
I formed an acquaintance when we were
both boys at the
same
school
together, I
have not
seen
him for
some
time, but I
always
thought him a worthy fellow, and am
now happy in the renewal of our intimacy.
He did not mention the name of his friend.
You may judge therefore what was my
astonishment
, when
just
before dinner a
servant
announced Mr. Belger. I know
not why it was, but I felt
myself
strangely
embarrassed
while he was paying his
compliments
.
Mr. Belger too was
surprised
,
and looked
abashed
at the unexpected
rencounter
,
for I had not
seen
him
since
the
cold wet night when we parted at the
end of
Kensington
. However, I
immediately
accosted
him by name and turning
to Mr.
Rooksby
endeavoured at a
smile
,
while I
said
, This is an old acquaintance
of mine too, though I dare
say
Mr. Belger
had not the
most
distant
idea of
seeing
me
here. I then enquired after Mrs. Belger
and Emma.
Emma is abroad in a convent, madam,
he repliedand, her motherHe
hesitated
,
and I at that moment perceiving he
was
dressed
in
second
mourning,
instantly
understood
his meaning. I felt my eyes fill.
I remembered her
gentleness
and affection,
and I
also
remembered how ill that affection
had been requited.
And pray, my dear,
said
Mr.
Rooksby
,
where were you acquainted with my friend
Belger?At
Kensington
, I replied.
At
Kensington
!
said
he with
visible
emotion
Did you know many
persons
there.
Very few, indeed; for at that time I was
not in a
situation
to receive many
visitants
.
I did not
choose
, my dear Celia, to
mention
having known Mrs. Moreton; as
she
was
undoubtedly a woman of light character,
the being
supposed
, an intimate of
such
a
woman, would by no means contribute to
raise
me in Mr.
Rooksby
's opinion, I
therefore
endeavoured to give the
conversation
a
different turn, and dinner being
soon
after
announced, it
assisted
my
design
, and we
spoke
afterwards only on indifferent
subjects
.I
am by no means
pleased
with Belger's being
on an intimate footing in our family, he is
not a proper companion for
Rooksby
, I am
certain he is of libertine principles, fond of
gaming and
dissipated
in his manners, yet
greatly as I
dislike
him, I dare not mention
it to Mr.
Rooksby
, as he
seems
extremely
fond of him and places the
most
implicit
confidence in his honour, and has actually
invited him to
pass
some
weeks this
summer
with us here, I am mortified and vexed,
Amelia laughs at me, when I mention my
anxiety and
says
, he will now be fearful of
insulting
me by any mention of his love.
While I was unprotected he could treat me
with
disrespect
, without fear of being called
to an account, now it is quite a different
affair.Indeed, Celia, this is not what I
dread, but I think if Mr.
Rooksby
should
by any means hear how intimate we once
were, he would be
displeased
, and it might
be the
cause
of great
uneasiness
between us,
I
shall
take particular care to avoid all
opportunities
of being entertained alone by this
F 2
man, and feel happy in the reflection that
while I am in the country I
shall
have Amelia
constantly
with me.
22d.
Since I began my letter I have been
so
agitated and
distressed
I found
myself
totally
unequal to the
task
of
finishing
it. Now I
have
sat
down for that
purpose
, I hardly
know how to arrange the extraordinary
events that have happened within
these
last
twelve days, nor am I certain that you, my
dear Celia, will entirely approve of my
conduct
;
yet
sure
you will not greatly condemn
me: for your gentle heart is benevolence
itself
. On the evening of the day on which
I began my letter, I could not but
observe
that Mr.
Rooksby
was extremely thoughtful
and grave, a thing with him very uncommon,
as his
usual
demeanor is chearful, and his
conversation
lively.Once or twice, I
thought (for I
observed
him narrowly,)
I
saw
the tears
start
in his eyes, he
sighed
deeply and often. His mother remarked his
want of
spirits
and inquired if he was well.
His
answer
was, yes madam, very well, but
rather out of
spirits
, I
shall
be better
to-morrow
,
do not pay any attention to it.I
thought it was
best
not to
speak
,
least
urgent
inquiries might
encrease
rather than relieve
his evident
depression
; and in
case
any family
affair had
occasioned
his
uneasiness
I was
sensible
he would not
choose
to mention it
before his mother and Amelia.I therefore
determined to let it
rest
, if he thought it
right that I
should
be informed of the
cause
,
he would the
first
convenient opportunity
communicate it; if not, it would I naturally
supposed
only
increase
his vexation to be
teized with impertinent inquiries. When
we retired he
spoke
but little,
seemed
buried in thought, and I am certain,
slept
little all night. This was too muchI felt
my heart partake of his
uneasiness
, though
I was ignorant of its origin. I longed to
lighten his anxiety by participation;
Yet, feared to be
troublesome
.After
breakfast
perceiving his dejection rather
increase
than
diminish
, I followed him into
the
shrubbery
, and finding him
sitting
in a
melancholy,
musing
posture
,
seated
myself
beside
him, and laying my hand on his arm,
said
with a voice, that evidently
spoke
my
tender
solicitude
Rooksby
you are not happy.
I am not, indeed, my dear Meriel, I am
very far from it; but do not let it interrupt
your tranquillity. The
cause
of my
present
dejection will
soon
be removed, and then I
shall
again enjoy with
pleasure
the
society
of the
best
of wives; but at
present
, my
love, I
must
request
you to leave me, as
I am unfit for
conversation
.
And can you,
Rooksby
, think me
worthy
of the flattering appelation you
just
now gave me, and yet
suppose
me
capable
of
preserving
my tranquillity while I
see
you unhappy.
You know, my
sweet
girl, I think you
all, that is good and amiable in woman,
and it is for your peace of mind I would
endeavour to hide my
unhapiness
.
But as you connot hide it from the eye
of affection, then
refuse
me not the
pleasure
,
my dear
Rooksby
of at
least
participating
.
If I cannot alleviate your anxiety,
surely
you cannot fear to place a confidence
in the
chosen
friend of your heart.
Oh no! but I know it will give you
no
pleasure
to be informed, nay, I fear it
would rather make you unhappy in an
eminent
degree.
Then it is
something
of great
consequence
either to your honour or
interest
,
or perhaps to both: if
so
, I
must
one day
know it, and
sure
the tidings will not give
me
so
much pain from you, as from the
lips of another.
Oh! my gentle love, do not
press
me,
you have no idea of what my heart at this
moment
suffers
, while I
refuse
to gratify
your laudable
curiosity
. Yes, my dear
Meriel
I
know the only incentive to be thus
pressing
, is a generous
wish
to relieve my
anxiety; but believe me, you cannot form
the
remotest
idea of the
cause
. If you
could, you would look on me with a
mixture
of horror and
disgust
.
Say not
so
,
Rooksby
; do not think
so
meanly of your wife as to
suppose
her
capapable
of thinking of you a moment
without
affection, without an ardent
wish
to
see
you as perfectly happy, as it is
possible
for
mortal to be.
Can, my
dearest
-life, think of no
incident
that might happen, that would
weaken
her affection towards me.
None.Were it
possible
, (but I know
it not) that forgetful of your vows, you
could prove
false
to your Meriel
she
could
never forget that you had
raised
her from
indigence! that you were her
husband
!
and the father of her child!
Dearest
,
best
of womankind
false
to
thee! Norather
should
my heart
cease
to
beat. I
see
your heroic
spirit
is adequate
to any trial; no longer will I keep you in
suspense
. I have
seen
Clara.
And, is that all!fye!
Rooksby
, fye!
could you think that would give me a
moments
pain. Believe me were it in my
power
to be of the
least
service
to Mrs. Millar,
I would
instantly
fly to do it.
Angelic
goodness
! but could you
indeed
forgive her.
I have no right to call her too account,
my dear
Rooksby
, for her errors: but tell
me, is
she
in
distress
. If
so
, I know
she
is my fellow creature, and it is my duty to
relieve her.
Meriel, (
said
he catching me in his arms)
while tears of exultation
burst
from his eyes,
you
surpass
even the elevated idea I had
formed of your prudence and virtue, Clara
is in
distress
, I met her
yesterday
, with
scarcely
cloaths to
shield
her from the inclemency
of the weather. She told me
she
had
past
the two
last
nights in the open air,
exposed
to nocturnal damps; that lovely form that
once was
shielded
by a tender
husband
from
even the
most
trifling inconvenience, had
nought to
rest
upon but the cold earth, no
canopy but heaven,and two days had
past
since
she
had
tasted
food.
Merciful heaven,
said
I, (while my eyes
overflowed,) why have I been kept thus long
in ignorance, were is
she
, let us go, my dear
Rooksby
,
shall
I quietly enjoy the luxuries
of life while poor Clara is in want of even
the
necessaries
.
I relieved her at the time, my love. Do
not feel
so
acutely, I even
promised
again to
see
her; but my heart
smote
me, I thought
should
it reach your ears, you would think
me the
besest
of mankind.
I
should
think you
so
, indeed, were you
capable of beholding unmoved the
miseries
of a woman, with whom you once lived on
terms of the
greatest
familiarity: but we
are
losing
time. Let us
hasten
to the poor
sufferer
. Who knows, but we may lead
her back to the paths of virtue? But hold!
you
shall
go alone,
Rooksby
. She may
consider
my
presence
as an
insult
.
She
must
, if
she
reflects at all, my dear
Meriel, think it the
highest
condescention
;
and if you will be
so
generous as to
visit
and
promise
her your protection, I will
write her a note to prepare her for the
interview
,
and you
shall
see
her in the
afternoon
.
You will accompany me then?
No, dear girl, I will not. After what
has
past
, it is
impossible
to doubt either
your delicacy or
generosity
. You
shall
act
entirely as your own heart directs. I am
sure
by leaving you to its dictates, Clara
will have no
reason
to complain: but let
me intreat you not to mention this affair,
either to my mother or
Miss
Sidney. I am
sure
they would blame the generous ardour
with which you
espouse
the
cause
of the
unfortunate
Clara.
I
promised
silence
, and we returned to
the
house
,
Rooksby
all life,
spirit
and
tenderness
;
and I planing fifty different
schemes
for Clara's future
support
. At
dinner Mrs.
Rooksby
was quite happy to
see
Clement's
chearfulness
returned; and
Miss
Sidney was too delicate and
considerate
to
ask
any
questions
concerning his late
dejection and
absence
of mind.
About five o'clock the chariot came to the
door, and
Rooksby
handed me in, telling me
the coachman knew where to drive, I
cannot
say
but during my little ride, I
underwent
great agitation of
spirits
, I am certainly
doing right, thought I, in offering my
protection
to the unfortunate Clara, and did not
humanity
point out my duty,
self
-
interest
would
urge me to a performance of it, for
should
I not
prove a friend to Clara,
Rooksby
undoubtedly
would; and
sensible
, as I was, of the undue
influence
she
once had over him, I could not
but fear, that influence might again be
exerted
to his ruin:
Besides
,
said
I, who knows
but Clara, had
she
been
blest
with friends
to direct her, and
counsel
her aright might at
this moment have been a
shining
member of
society
. Alas, it might have been my fate
to wander forlorn and unprotected thro' the
world, had it not been for the
interposition
of providence, who
so
wonderfully inclined
the heart of the friendly Mr. Welldon to grant
me
succour
and relief; and
shall
I who have
experienced
such
blessings
and
support
from
an All Governing power,
refuse
my feeble
assistance
to
raise
from
sorrow
and infamy, a
poor fallen
sister
. Oh no! That
same
benignant
Power has pointed out my duty in
the
clearest
manner, and I
trust
will not
suffer
me to be backward in the performance
vol. iii. G
of it.Fully occupied by
these
and
similar
reflections, I hardly perceived what route the
carriage had taken, till it
stopped
at the
door of a
small
neat cottage. A
wholesome
looking young woman
presented
herself
. I
enquired for Mrs. Millar and was
shewn
into
a parlour and informed
she
would wait on
me immediately. I was
scarcely
seated
when
the door opened, and (judge if
possible
my
surprize
,) Mrs. Moreton entered.An
exclamation of wonder
escaped
me. Oh!
Madam,
said
she
, and unable to articulate
more,
sunk
on the
nearest
chair, covered her
face with her hands and
burst
into tears.
Be not alarmed,
said
I, in the
gentlest
accent I could
assume
, you have nothing to
fear from me. But tell me do you live in
this
house
, and are you any ways connected
with the unfortunante Mrs. Millar.
Oh! dear lady,
said
she
, (
sinking
on her
knees and
raising
her
streaming
eyes to my
face) I am that unhappy wretch, I am that
ungrateful
monster
who have injured (though
Heaven knows involuntarily,) the very
woman
,
who now
generously
comes to
save
me
from
despair
.
I was greatly affected, my dear Celia, I
raised
the afflicted penitent, and bade her
be comforted.
Comfort! exclaimed
she
vehemently,
Alas! where can a wretch,
whose
crimes
are
so
multiplied as mine, find it?
It is never denied to the truly penitent:
and I hope you will experience its benign
influence.
I
shall
! I begin to feel it already dawn
on my benighted
soul
. It comes
adminitered
by an angel's hand.
I then made
some
enquiries concerning
her
present
situation
, and
requested
to be
informed, in what manner I could render
her
service
which would be
most
acceptable.
You cannot, my dear Madam,
said
she
, judge how far I am worthy your
compassion
,
unless
you will permit me to acquaint
you with the chief incidents of my
past
life.
I know at this moment, I appear to you an
unworthy unprincipled wretch. When I
think of the
situation
, in which I left you
at
Kensington
, I cannot but reflect how
little
I
should
expect from your hands. Nay
that my very life is in your power, but when
I
shall
inform how much I
suffered
for the
unintentional injury I did you, I flatter
myself
you will pity and forgive me.
But I
must
insist
,
said
I, that you
do not enter upon this detail till your
situation
is rendered more comfortable than it is
at
present
.
Permit me,
said
she
, interrupting me,
to remain at this cottage a few days. In
that time, I will endeavour to commit to
your
perusal
a written account of my
miserable
life, from the
earliest
period of
recollection
till now. I am
sensible
you will find
much to blamebut, alas! you will find
much more to awaken your
compassion
.
My crimes, though many, have not been
my own: but my afflictions are. I have
neither friend or relation to
console
,
comfort
,
or alleviate my
anguish
.
The agony her countenance
expressed
, as
she
uttered this, is not to be
described
. I
felt her
solitary
, forlorn
situation
, and while
the tear of
sympathy
trembled in my eye, I
breathed forth the accents of
connsolation
.
When
she
grew more
composed
, I
arose
to
take my leave;but was
sadly
at a
loss
how to offer the
assistance
I was
sensible
she
wanted, without hurting her feelings. At
length I ventured to draw forth my
purse
.
She laid her hand on my armThat is
entirely
needless
,
said
she
, Mr.
Rooksby
has been very liberal. Let me not be
thus
oppressed
with obligation, till
some
way is pointed out for me in
some
measure
to
show
my gratitude.Call it not an
obligation
,
said
I, It is only a debt due from
the happy to the unfortunate. I have one
request
to make, dear madam,
said
she
,
suffer
me then to decline this offered favour
in hopes you will grant me the one nearer
my heart.Name it,
said
I.It is,
she
replied, that you will forbear
mentioning
the
circumstances
that
past
at
Kensington
to Mr.
Rooksby
, till you have
received
my letter. After that you will think
of me with more clemency than you do at
present
.
I bade her be quite
easy
in that
respect
,
and leaving the
purse
on the table returned
to the Hall, where I found Mrs.
Rooksby
and Amelia wonderfully curious to know
where I had been. To keep a particular
appointment I
assure
you,
said
Clement,
and as I am the only
consident
, that is
trusted
in the affair, I beg you will not be
inquisitive
concerning it; for I have
promised
secrecy
.
He did not make any enquiry of what
had
passed
at our interview, but pointedly
avoided the
subject
. The next morning he
presented
me with two hundred pounds,
saying
,
G 2
My dear Meriel's expences may at
this time be greater than
usual
. Make
use
of this my love, and
should
you require
more, you know where to apply. This
sum
I
shall
look upon as the property of
Clara, and when we have
settled
some
plan
for her future
support
, it
shall
be
appropriated
entirely to her
use
. I was very impatient
for the
promised
letter, as I imagined it
almost
impossible
for her to extenuate a conduct
so
unjust
and cruel as hers had been toward me;
but
resolved
at all events to judge as candidly
as
possible
, and extend toward her a
friendship
,
which may awaken in her mind a
just
sense
of her
past
errors, and lead her
imperceptibly
to the love and practice of virtue.
At length the long expected packet
arrived
.
I
send
a copy for my dear Celia's
perusal
.
Oh! my friend, when you have
perused
it, you will like me,
shed
tears of
sympathy
over poor Clara's
sufferings
, till
her offences are blotted from your
remembrance
.Farewell,
my Celia.
Everyaffectionate
wish
for your
happiness
, flows from
the heart of your
MERIEL.
LETTER XLVI.
CLARA to MRS. ROOKSBY.
June
20
th
, 1783.
Though
I have taken up my pen to
address
the
most
benevolent woman on
earth, I
shudder
to think in what a
despicable
light I
shall
appear.Oh! Madam, the heart
not entirely rendered callous by guilt,
shrinks
from the
scrutinizing
eye of
superior
virtue,
yet painful as the
task
is, I feel it is a duty I
owe, to you, to
myself
, and to my dear
forsaken
children.I am not, madam, as my
sister
-in-law
represented
to Mr.
Rooksby
,
the daughter of a decayed officer; Alas! my
friendship
with this cruel
sister
, has been the
chief
cause
of all my guilt and
misery
. My
father was a gentleman of genteel fortune,
and
unsullied
reputation. I was his only
child, and at the age of thirteen having
lost
my mother was placed at a boarding
school
near Oxford, where I received a genteel
education
;
and to my utter regret formed an
acquaintance with Eleanor
Ramsay
,
she
was
five years older than
myself
and was a teacher
in this
school
,
she
had an
expensive
taste
for
dress
, and was
passionately
fond of gaiety and
pleasure
. My father made me a liberal
allowance
for my pocket
expenses
. Eleanor
was not
so
amply
supplied
,
she
told me that
her father had been dead for
some
years and
her mother's income was extremely confined
tho'
she
strained
it to the
utmost
in order
that
herself
and brother might have the
benefit of a liberal education.Young
Ramsay
was a genteel engaging youth, and at
that time employed in the
study
of the law.
He frequently came to
visit
his
sister
, and
sometimes
took her to places of public
entertainment
,
in which
excursions
I was
imprudently
allowed to accompany them.
Ramsay
pretended to be
struck
with my
person
; but
I have
since
been convinced the fortune my
father
possessed
and of which I was
supposed
heiress
, was the chief incentive to the
passion
he
so
ardently
prosessed
. Eleanor was plain
in her
person
, but artful and
insinuating
in
her manner. She
constantly
contrived
parties
of
pleasure
, in which I was included: and
in return I
supplied
her with money to
purchase
any article of finery which her own
narrow allowance would not afford.
In this manner we proceeded till I reached
my
sixteenth
year, when on receiving a
summons
from my father to prepare to quit
school
entirely,
Ramsay
and his
sister
shewed
such
marks of affliction at our approaching
separation
,
the former declaring his
existence
depended on my
constancy
and affection;
that giddy,
thoughtless
, and
easily
persuaded
,
I
consented
to an elopement and
accompanied
these
false
friends to Scotland, where
I
sealed
myself
the
most
wretched of
womankind
,
by uniting
myself
to an
unprincipled
wretch, in
whose
whole family there was
not one atom of honour or
generosity
.On
our return we
hastened
to my father and
humbly
requested
his pardon and
blessing
.
Alas! I had forfeited all claim to both. He
spurned
me from him, and declared he
would never
see
my face again.
Overwhelmed
with afflicton, I had now no
course
to take, but to repair with my
husband
to
London
to his mother and
sister
, who, I thought,
received me very coldly,
considering
how
eagerly
they had
strove
to promote the union.
Even
Ramsay
himself
was much altered in his
manner and I began to perceive, that they
considered
me as a burthen. I wrote a
most
penetential
letter to my father,
requesting
to be
received, and offering to quit a man, whom
I found my heart was by no means attached
to; but the
answer
I received was, that as
I had voluntarily quitted his protection for
that of a
husband
, and taken the liberty to
choose
for
myself
, without
consulting
him
on the propriety of my choice, I
must
take
the
consequence
of my precipitancy: but,
he feared, if I paid as little regard to the
duties of a wife, as I had done to
those
of a
daughter, my
husband
would
soon
have
reason
to repent our union. He
enclosed
me a
note for two hundred pounds, declaring it
was all I
must
ever expect, as he had made
his will in favour of a
sister
's
son
then abroad
in the navy. This money proved a
seasonable
relief, as Mrs.
Ramsay
's affairs were
greatly deranged; but it was
soon
expended
,
and I was again reduced to bear the
ill-nature
of all the family; for
Ramsay
never
entertained a thought of giving me even an
apartment to
myself
, nor indeed was it in
his power, as he had no employment by
which we could hope to be
supported
. We
had been married about a twelve-month,
when he received an offer of accompanying
a young gentleman abroad. This he
eagerly
accepted, and I was left with Mrs.
Ramsay
.
My
situation
was as uncomfortable as
you can
possibly
imagine, I had not money
even for
necessary
expences, and I could not
help perceiving, that even my food was
grudged by my mother-in-law. I thought
once more of making a
personal
application
to my father, but to my great affliction,
he at that time died
suddenly
, and all his
property devolved to the relation I have
already
mentioned. Though Mrs.
Ramsay
's
finances were very confined,
she
lived in an
expensive
manner, kept a good deal of
company
and went frequently into public. One
night being with her at the play, we were
accosted
by an elderly gentleman, who
sat
in the box with us,
shewed
us many civilities
during the evening, and when the
entertainment
was ended,
insisted
on
setting
us down
at our own door in his carriage, I thought
there was an impropriety in accepting
these
civilities from a perfect
stranger
; but as my
mother and
sister
acquiesced
, I knew it would
only be deemed prudery in me to
resist
.I,
therefore, followed their example, and
steped
into the carriage. When we arrived at
home, the gentleman
asked
permission
to
enquire after our health the
ensuing
morning,
which was granted. On our entering the
house
I began to rally Eleanor on the
conquest
she
had made, as I naturally imagined
these
civilities were intended for her, but
Mrs.
Ramsay
cried with more good humour
than I had heard her
speak
for
some
time.
s
No, no! my dear, Eleanor has no right
to the glory of the
conquest
, I fancy it is
you, my pretty Clara, who have attracted
the old gentleman's notice; Eleanor's
person
is not adapted for making
conquests
.I
hope you are
mistaken
, madam, I replied;
for I
should
greatly rejoice in any good
fortune which may happen to my
sister
. For
my own part, my lot is
cast
.
The next morning, Mr. Millar (for it was
he, who had
accosted
us the night before)
called, and after chatting
some
time on
indifferent
subjects
, offered to take us that
evening to Ranelagh. From this time an
intimacy
commenced, and I
soon
really
understood
,
that my unfortunate
person
had
been the object of his
pursuit
. It was in
vain I
remonstrated
on the impropriety of a
married woman
listening
to overtures of love.
Mrs.
Ramsay
treated the
remonstrance
as
folly and romance. What
shall
I
say
, my
dear madam, ill treated at home,
distressed
in my
circumstances
, no friend near to whom
I could apply for advice or
assistance
. I
insensibly
gave way to the
delusions
of
splendor
and affluence, and one evening at a
masquerade
consented
to my ruin.A few days
after
this fatal night, I went with Mr. Millar
to Oxford, which was the place of his
residence
.
Eleanor accompanied me and I
assumed
the name of Millar. As I had not
received a line from my
husband
since
his
departure from England, I imagined he had
totally forgot me and would be as happy to
be
released
from the burthen of maintaining
me, as he once pretended he
should
be in
obtaining my hand.
Mr. Millar was extremely fond of me, I
endeavoured as much as was in my power
to return this affection with gratitude; but
alas! madam, I was far from happy.
Conscious
guilt had fixed her fangs in my
bosom
and knowing
myself
unworthy the attentions
I daily received from the virtuous part of my
sex
. I began to envy a
superiority
, the
consciousness
of which had given me
so
much pain; but though I was far from
happy
I had not yet
tasted
the
misery
of loving
one object, while I felt
myself
bound to
another. That
superlative
excess
of
anguish
was
reserved
for me, 'till accident
introduced
Mr. Millar to Mr.
Rooksby
. I will not
repeat the
steps
I took, (tears of contrition
bathe my cheeks while I write it) to deceive
the worthy Mr. Millar, and indulge my
tenderness
for
Rooksby
. Suffice it to
say
I
gave a
loose
to love, and experienced its
effects with more violence, as it was the
first
time my heart had ever been
sensible
of
the
passion
; and certain it is, when we have
taken one
step
in guilt we never
pause
at a
second
or a third, when either
interest
or
pleasure
urges our
pursuit
. You have no doubt
been informed of my leaving Mr. Millar
and following Mr.
Rocksby
to town; I
VOL. III. H
shall
therefore
pass
over every
circumstance
that
ensued
until my acquaintance with you,
(then
Miss
Howard) at Mrs. La Cours, and
your
subsequent
removal to
Kensington
. At
that time I had
relinquished
the name of
Millar; but as I had an invincible
aversion
to that of
Ramsay
, and Mr.
Rooksby
refused
me his, I
assumed
my own maiden name
of Moreton. While I
resided
at
Kensington
,
I received Mr.
Rooksby
's
visits
very
privately, as he was anxious for me to
preserve
my character, and I
wished
to appear
to you in the light of an amiable woman.
I
saw
you regarded me with
esteem
, and I
knew your heart too well to
suppose
that
esteem
would be continued, if you knew
I was a
slave
to guilty
passion
.Believe me,
dearest
,
best
of womankind, I never
entertained
an idea to your
disadvantage
. I
wished
from my
soul
to promote your welfare,
and have taught my heart to rejoice in your
prosperity
, though that
prosperity
has torn
from my agonized heart every earthly good:
but to proceedThe day before I called on
you and
bespoke
the linen for my
sister
Eleanor
,
I had received a note from Mrs.
Ramsay
informing me that a particular relation
was come to town, and as they were
unacquainted
with my connection with Mr.
Millar
,
&c. and
still
regarded me as the wife
of her
son
,
she
wished
me to come to town
and make them a
visit
, taking the
eldest
child with me. On the morning preceding
the day on which this
visit
was to be paid,
Eleanor
let my watch fall, and without
acquainting
me with the
circumstance
sent
it to
have the damage repaired. You know
what followed. I went to town; but, alas!
on my arrival at my mother's, who
should
I meet but my unworthy
husband
. I now
too late
discovered
that my
sister
had been
in the plot to betray me. He
instantly
claimed me, as his lawful wife, and
insisted
on my accompanying him abroad, from
whence, he
said
, he had only returned to
fetch me; as he had through the
interest
of
his friend, obtained a very
respectable
place
under the French government. It was in
vain to
remonstrate
. I was was obliged to
comply, and early the next morning we
set
off for Dover, leaving the children with
Mrs.
Ramsay
. On our arrival in that place,
it was too late to think of
crossing
the
channel
that night. We therefore
bespoke
a
passage
on board a packet, and as it was to
sail
by five o'clock the next morning, we
retired early to bed. But judge, dear
madam
,
if
possible
, my
anguish
and
surprize
,
when awaking about
seven
o'clock, I found
my
husband
and
sister
had left me, and
taken
with them my trunks containing all my
clothes, jewels, money, &c. leaving me
nothing but about
six
guineas which I had
in my pocket.
I
arose
with a heavy heart, and ordered
some
breakfast
. While I was taking my
solitary
meal, I thought I heard a voice that
was familiar to my ears, and inquiring of
the maid who attended what company was
then in the
house
, I learnt that Mr.
Rooksby
was there on his way to France, and that
the packet he had taken for
himself
and
servants
did not
sail
till the next ride. I then
remembered his informing me at his
last
visit
, that he
should
be obliged to
visit
the
continent before he could
see
me again, and
overjoyed to find him in the
same
house
with me,
considered
the treatment I had
suffered
from my
husband
as a fortunate
circumctance
,
as it would probably procure me
the
pleasure
of accompanying my adored
Rooksby
abroad. Pardon, madam,
these
involuntary
expressions
of affection, I will
strive
to
restrain
my pen: but when the
heart has once been
strongly
attached, it is
hard to break it of its
usual
effusions
of
tenderness
. I bid the
servent
shew
me to
the room where he was, and
rushing
into it,
overcome with the various emotions, which
agitated my
bosom
, I fainted in his arms.
It will be
needless
to repeat our
conversation
.
I
must
only remark, that as I had
never informed him of my unfortunate
marriage
with
Ramsay
, and, as he had
always
supposed
me the wife of Mr. Millar,
I did not dare explain to him the real
cause
of my abrupt appearance at Dover. He
attributed
it
solely
to my affection to
himself
,
and I
blest
the chance which had led me to
him.
On our return from the continent, I made
many enquiries concerning my dear
Miss
Howard, for whom I had
suffered
many an
anxious hour; but could not by any means
learn where you had taken refuge after
the inhuman treatment you had
experienced
at
Kensington
. I make no doubt,
madam
,
but you are acquainted with every
circumstance
, preceding the time in which
I had hoped to be united to Mr.
Rooksby
.
I had
previously
wrote to Mrs.
Ramsay
,
requesting
,
she
would
use
her
interest
with her
son
to
relinquish
all claim to me as his wife,
and indeed, I had been informed I could
refute that claim by pleading infancy at the
time of my imprudent elopement. To
these
letters I received the
most
satisfactory
answers
,
signed
by both
Ramsay
and his
mother
,
declaring they were heartily weary of
the connection and would gladly renounce it,
on condition of my paying a
stipulated
sum
of
money, to which I readily agreed, and began
H 2
to look forward with hope to days of future
happiness
, and let me add innocence, for I felt
my heart
so
firmly attached to the generous
Rooksby
, as to render it
impossible
for me
ever to injure him even in thought. But, ah!
my dear madam, how
soon
were
these
bright
prospects
overclouded, how quickly was this
charming hope
snatched
from me, and, my
bosom
left a
chearless
and
desolate
chaos,
which peace or joy can never more enliven.
When I endeavour to retrace this
most
heart
rending period of my life:
such
agonizing
feelings overpower me, that my tears flow in
scalding
torrents down my cheeks; and
sighs
of acute
anguish
rend my
bosom
. I cannot
at
present
proceed in my recital.Oh!
heavens
,
that one who knows
so
well the
just
value of virtue,
should
be
irresistibly
impelled
to actions from which her
soul
shrinks
with horror. The innocent may pity, but
they cannot have the
remotest
idea of my
sufferings
.
IN CONTINUATION.
My heart is more at
ease
, tears are a
sweet
relief to the unfortunate, and when I
remembered
the words of
consolation
which I had
listened
to from the lips of angelic purity,
when the benevolent Mrs.
Rooksby
cheared
me with her
presence
, a
soothing
reflection,
something
like hope, pervaded my
bosom
,
and though tears
still
continued to fall, they
fell without pain. I will now proceed in my
narrative.
On the evening preceding the day on
which I flattered
myself
with becoming the
happiest
of my
sex
, I expected Mrs.
Ramsay
to receive the money which I had
promised
to pay her, and therefore,
desired
the
servants
to deny me, even to the
chosen
master
of my
affections. Unfortunate hour, of what
scenes
of
misery
wert thou the harbinger, but I will
not complain, I acknowledge I
deserved
it all,
for had I not deceived the
best
the
worhiest
of mankind, by daring to accept his
honourable
offers, when I knew
myself
already
sacrificed
(I will not
say
united) to a villain.
But what will not a woman do, who loves,
who doats to
madness
and fears to be
separated
forever from the object of her adoration,
what errors will not the heart involuntarily
commit when under the influence of
hood-winked
passion
?
It was about nine o'clock as I was
sitting
in the
nursery
, with my two dear boys, that
a
servant
informed me the
person
whom I
expected was below, I
kissed
my
sweet
cherubs
bade them good night and repaired to the
parlour, which I had appointed to receive
Mrs.
Ramsay
in; but how great was my
astonishment
on entering the room to
see
my
inexorable tormenter and his
sister
Eleanor,
with their mother. I gave a
shriek
and
sunk
trembling on the
nearest
chair.
Ramsay
approached me with feigned
tenderness
why
these
alarms, my dear Clara,
said
he why
should
you
start
thus to behold the
man who adores you, and who though you
have cruelly
deserted
and injured, is ready
again to receive you to his arms, and willing
to forget all that is
past
.would to
heaven
said
I, that every
past
action of my life
could be buried in eternal oblivion,
particularly
that to which I was artfully led by you
and your
insinuating
sister
, of giving you my
hand, when a moment's reflection would
have convinced me you had no
share
in my
heart.
It is well, madam,
said
he, you have
made a frank
confession
; but know it is amply
in my power to revenge the repeated
insults
and injuries I have received from you.You
flatter
yourself
it is in your power to annual
a marriage contracted in your minority, but
it is not; and
unless
you
consent
to make me
master
of all the money and jewels at
present
in your
possession
, and leaving this
house
accompany
me wherever I
choose
to go, I
will to-morrow follow you to the Church
and in the face of the whole congregation
expose
your infamous conduct, and claim my
prior right not only to your
person
, but to
all the wealth your infatuated lover has
heaped
upon you.What were my
sufferings
at this horrid moment. Turn either way,
infamy
stared
me in the face. I was unable
to determine what plan to
pursue
. To
remain
in London was
impossible
, after what
had
past
as I
should
undoubtedly have been
the
jest
even of my own
servants
. At length
I concluded, whatever might be my fate, the
generous
Rooksby
should
not be involved in
the
shame
that would
consequently
ensue
on
a public
exposure
of my guilt, I therefore
told
Ramsay
I was ready to accompany him
wherever he
pleased
; but as to the
presents
I had received from Mr.
Rooksby
, I did not
conceive I had any right to take them with
me.
This was not what the wretch wanted
Horrible menaces and threats were
used
to
prevail on me to give him my
cash
and jewels,
I was intirely in the power of
these
three
wretches, nor did I dare even to call for the
assistance
of my
servants
, as they all declared
my life
should
pay the forfeit of
such
an
attempt: and when they had gained their
point, and I attempted to go up
stairs
to fetch
the jewels, both Mrs.
Rainsay
and Eleanor
accompanied me. On returning to the
parlour
,
they
desired
me to
send
for a Hackney
Coach.Then it was, dear madam that my
innocent infants darted
across
my memory.
I
must
have my children,
said
I.
Indeed
,
said
the unfeeling
Ramsay
, but you
will not. The brats are none of mine; leave
them then to him who has a right to
maintain
them.
To
describe
my
anguish
at this cruel
speech
is
impossible
.You, madam, are a mother,
and it is only a mother can conceive my
sufferings
.
I knelt, I bathed his feet with tears,
and embraced his knees, but in vain. Too
much under the dominion of fear to exert
myself
to
insist
on their being taken with
me, I
suffered
myself
to be led more dead
than alive to the coach; and that very night
we all
set
out for Cornwall. What arts they
made
use
of to deceive my
servant
, I know
not; but before our departure from
London
my trunks were brought to Mrs.
Ramsay's
,
and one
small
one containing every
necessary
for travelling was opened that I
might
dress
myself
in a proper manner for
so
long a journey. I never could learn how
they had contrived this, but am rather led
to imagine they had bribed my own woman
to their
interest
.During my
comfortless
journey, all my thoughts were occupied by
my beloved children, who were left entirely
to the humanity of a man, whom I had
deceived
and injured in the
grossest
manner,
and who might avenge the mother's crimes
by
deserting
her offspring. I was
sensible
Rooksby
possessed
a benevolent heart, but
when I remembered the provocations I had
given himI trembled for the fate of my
poor infants,
whose
only birth-rights were
poverty,
shame
, and the contempt of the
world. It is
impossibe
for any one, who has
not been in the
same
situation
to judge of my
distress
. The anxiety of my mind affected
my health, and before we arrived at our
journey's end I was in a high fever. We
stopped
at a village near
Saltash
, where my
disorder
increased
to
such
a degree that it
was dangerous to think of removing me. A
delirium
ensued
and I raved (as I have been
since
informed)
incessantly
for
Rooksby
and
my children. At length, youth and a good
constitution
combated the
strength
of my
disorder
; and after a profound
sleep
of
many
hours, I awoke to perfect
reason
; but
Gracious Heaven! what were my feelings,
to learn when I enquired for
Ramsay
and
Eleanor, that they were gone, and with them
all my property. The clergyman of the
parish
a humane
sensible
man had frequently
visited
me, during my
illness
, and now
entered
the room with an intent to
see
if I yet
lived. It was to him I had been indebted
for all the attentions that had been
shewn
me: and when he found me capable of
reading
,
he put into my hands a letter which he
said
my brother had left for me. At the
word brother I
expressed
some
astonishment
:
but my
curiosity
and impatience to read the
letter would not then permit an explanation.
This was the letter
TO MRS. MORETON.
In your attempts to dupe others you have
been effectually duped
yourself
. Vain,
foolish
woman, who thought your
boasted
beauty
would
insure
you admirers in all who beheld
you.
Ramsay
is not your
husband
. He
was mine long before he
saw
you. From
the
first
moment he beheld you, I
saw
you
had
supplanted
me in his affections, and
therefore determined on revenge. I have
(thank my kind genius) amply effected it,
and reduced you to the
lowest
abyss
of
infamy
and
shame
. My mother exults in your
debasement
, and bids you go vaunt your
fancied
superiority
, and
see
if it will regain
the reputation you have
lost
.
You have no right to the name of
Ramsay
,
nor indeed, to any but that of
Moreton
,
which you have
shamefully
disgraced
.
Ramsay
, was my maiden name, and as my
marriage was a private one, my
husband
when
visiting
me always
chose
to
assume
that, and
pass
for my brother. I
enclose
you ten pounds, if you live it will be of
some
service
to you, if not, whoever opens this
may make
use
of it for
past
expences. I
sincerely
, and from my
soul
,
wish
your
recovery
,
as my triumph will not be
complete
,
unless
I know you have felt the
misery
,
in which I glory to have involved you.
ELEANOR.
Before I had
finished
this inhuman letter,
I fell into
strong
convulsions
, which
occasioned
a
relapse
of my
disorder
, and I was
again reduced to
insanity
.
The humane clergyman had me removed
to his own
house
, and by the kind
attentions
of
himself
and a daughter, I was in
time
restored
to health and a keen
sense
of
my deplorable
situation
.
As my
strength
returned, my afflictions
recurred to my mind with greater force
My dear
deserted
infants
perishing
for want,
VOL. III. I
or
exposed
to the
harsh
usage
experienced
by children left to the
parish
, were
constantly
before my eyes, and I
resolved
at
all events to return to London and learn
their fate. Ill as my benevolent
host
could
afford it, he lent me three guineas to help
me on my journey, and gave me a letter to
a poor woman, a late
parishioner
of his,
who was married and
settled
in London,
requesting
her to render me every
service
in
her power. With this
slender
sum
, I
sat
forward and after a
wearisome
journey,
sometimes
riding,
sometimes
walking, I arrived
safe
in town, and took up my abode with
the
person
just
mentioned. From the
enquiries
I made (for I had the temerity to
venture to Mr.
Rooksby
's
house
) I learnt
his happy marriage with the amiable
Miss
Howard, and inwardly rejoiced to think
that in
such
a union, his future
happiness
must
be
secure
. I
also
learnt, that my
children
were in
Devonshire
. The maternal
heart will yearn to pour forth its affection.
I had determined to walk to the environs of
Oak-hall and endeavour to gain a
sight
of
my beloved little ones, when a
most
untoward
accident prevented my putting my
designs
in execution. This was my kind
landlady falling ill, and as
she
kept a
shop
,
her
husband
earnestly
entreated me to
remain
with them till her recovery; to which
as I was under many obligations to them, I
could not but
assent
. Her
illness
was
painful
and lingering, and in the end terminated
her life. Soon after her
decease
, I
proposed
removing from the
house
, when the very
man, who had
so
earnestly
entreated my
stay
, now demanded payment for my board
and lodging. I had neither money nor
friends. What could I do? I thought once
of applying to Mr.
Rooksby
; but the fear
of giving you pain prevented me. I
submitted
to my hard fate in
silence
and was
conveyed to
prison
. Three months did
I linger in this wretched place, huddled
among the
most
abject and
miserable
of the
human race; and barely
existing
on the
scanty
pittance allowed me, and the charity of the
benevolent. At length, I was one day
recognized
by a
tradesman
, with whom I had
dealt in my days of affluence. He
commiserated
my condition,
generously
paid the
sum
for which I had been confined, and
gave me two guineas in my pocket. No
sooner
was I at liberty, than I
resumed
my
wish
of going to my children. I
set
forward
and
almost
begged my way to this place;
but alas! when here, what could I do for
support
, what door would open to receive
a poor wretch like me? I wandered every
day round the environs of the hall, and
once had the extatic
pleasure
of catching a
glance of my children: but I dared not
speak
to them, though I longed to fold
them to my maternal heart. My little
stock
of money was
soon
exhausted
, though I
lived
almost
upon bread and water, and at
night,
rested
my weary limbs on the damp
ground. But
conscience
told me it was all
right, and only a
just
punishment
for my
errors;
so
I bore it without complaint, and
watered my cold pillow with tears of
unfeigned
repentance. One afternoon, as I
was wandering in the adjacent fields,
overcome
by hunger and
distress
, I
sat
down
beside
a brook that ran along the
woodside
and after reflecting a few moments on the
horrors of my
situation
, I conceived the
impious
idea of putting a period to my
existence
.
I
arose
from my
seat
to put my
design
in execution, when hearing a
rustling
on the other
side
the hedge, I
started
; and
in a moment
saw
Mr.
Rooksby
come
across
a
stile
into the field where I was. I gave a
faint
scream
and
sunk
to the ground
oppressed
by
undescribable
emotions. Urged by
humanity, he approached and
raised
me
from the earth. I opened my eyes; but
dared not look at him.
Poor
soul
,
said
he, in the accent of
benevolence, you
seem
ill. Where
shall
I lead you, or what can I do to
serve
you.
Leave me, I replied, with a look and
voice of
destraction
Leave me
Rooksby
to the fate I merit.Gracious heaven!
said
he, is it
possible
, or do my
senses
deceive
me?Oh!
said
I,
clasping
my
hands, pity the wretched Clara, and leave
her to die in peace.
Clara, cried he,
slackening
the arm
that had
supported
me, poor infatuated
woman
,
how came you thus reduced?
I need not repeat what
answer
I made
suffice
it to
say
, I
saw
the tear of
compassion
sparkle
in his eye, and heard him declare, I
should
be permitted to
see
my children.
He gave me relief with a liberal hand, and
at parting,
desired
I would let him know
where to find me, that I might not be again
reduced to
such
misery
.
Thus, madam, have I retraced a life of
complicated guilt and
sorrow
. I am fully
sensible
of the benevolence and candor of
your heart, and I
trust
my unfeigned
penitence
joined to my
sufferings
will expunge
from your memory my faults. Teach me,
dear madam, how to convince you of my
gratitude for your great
condescension
in
interesting
yourself
in the fate of
so
worthless
a being as I am, and whatever plan your
I 2
goodness
shall
strike
out, I will invaribly
pursue
,
in hopes that my future life will convince
you, with what abhorrence I reflect on my
past
misconduct
. I have the honour to be,
&c. &c.
CLARA MORETON.
LETTER XLVII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Oak-hall
,
June 29th
, 1783.
I WAS obliged to
send
away my
last
in
such
a hurry, I had no time to make the
least
remark on Clara's letter. I will
confess
the
story
it contained did not
strike
me as
altogether
consistent
or probable; but I made
great allowances for that
self
love, which
urges us ever to extenuate as much as
possible
our errors; and endeavour to
set
our
conduct
in the
fairest
point of view. I
also
remembered
,
that whatever had been her
errors
,
she
was now penitent and in
distress
;
and
must
,
unless
some
friend
stepped
forward
to
save
her,
sink
into an untimely grave. I
did not
hesitate
in
resolving
to become that
friend, though I determined to keep the
whole affair concealed from Mrs.
Rooksby
and
Miss
Sidney, and, indeed, I inwardly
wished
that
Rooksby
might not
desire
to
see
Clara's
confession
, as by reading it he
must
discover
that I had known her before, which
would immediately bring on an explanation
of her cruel behavior to me, which he would
not be very ready to overlook or pardon.
Fortunately he never even
expressed
the
slightest
desire
to know what
she
had
said
.
I told him,
she
should
never want a friend,
while I had power to
assist
her; and he
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
of the
sincerity
of my
assertion
.
Accordingly I wrote to her,
informing
her if
she
would mention any place where
she
would like to
reside
, I would undertake to
pay her board and
besides
allow
something
handsome
for other
necessary
expences; but
recommended to her to fix her
residence
in
the country, where there would be fewer
allurements to draw her from the laudable
resolutions
she
had formed of amendment.
I received for
answer
, that the
fondness
of a
mother impelled her to
wish
her
residence
might be in the neighborhood of Oak-hall,
and that
she
was perfectly
satisfied
with the
family, with whom
she
then was; but if I
disapproved
of her remaining there,
she
was
ready to remove to any other place I might
think more
suitable
.
I am a mother
myself
, my dear Celia, and
I found it was
impossible
to deny her
request
.
She is now
settled
at the farm, and I have
ordered the two boys to be taken twice a
week to
see
her, though under this
restriction
,
that
she
does not betray
herself
to them,
as that would involve us all in
confusion
at
the hall, as I am certain my mother and
Miss
Sidney would be greatly
displeased
with my
taking any
interest
in her affairs, or
suffering
her to be
so
near our habitation;
she
continues
the name of Moreton, and as
she
lives
retired, and I would hope a truly penitent
and virtuous life. She does not excite any
enquiries that might lead to a
discovery
.
IN CONTINUATION.
August
3d
.
Last
night Mr. Belger arrived. I cannot
account for it, Celia, but the
presence
of
this man always
distresses
and alarms me. I
am never comfortable when he is in the
family
,
though it is only for a
visit
of a few
hours. How I
shall
support
his company for
six
weeks or two months, I cannot tell. It
is a long time
since
I have mentioned my
sweet
Clementina; believe me, were I to
give inclination the reins; I
should
fill a whole
sheet
with accounts of the dear little cherub's
daily improvement. But, though the theme
would be delightful for a fond mother to
expatiate
upon, I am
sensible
it would be but
insipid
, when offered to the
perusal
of one
who though
interested
in all my concerns,
never felt a mother's
tenderness
, anxiety and
solicitude
.
10th

You will be
surprized
, my dear Celia,
when I tell you, I am become the lady
Bountiful
of all our poor tenants and their families.
I walk round every morning or evening;
that the weather permits, and
administer
to
the
deseases
of both body and mind. In the
first
I am
assisted
by a worthy apothecary,
who having a large
share
of merit, Fortune
thought he had
sufficient
, and was therefore
extremely
sparing
of her favours;
so
that
the poor man with a great deal of knowledge
in his head, much benevolence in his heart,
and a large family in his
house
, had but very
little money in his
purse
. I heard of him
by accident, and not being extremely well,
sent
for him, though his unpowdered wig
and thread-bare coat would not have been a
recommendation, had I
consulted
his
appearance
only; but I chatted with him half an
hour
several
mornings
successively
, and found
his company more efficacious than his
medicines
;
for I was always better after his
visits
, the
reason
of which was, I thought the
doctor
himself
seemed
happier. So one
afternoon
,
Amelia and I took a
stroll
across
the
park, and
spent
an hour or two with his
wife and her
six
chubby,
rosy
cheeked
children
,
and at parting, contrived it
so
that at
the next
visit
the doctor came neither in an
unpowdered wig or thread-bare coat;
since
which time he has
constantly
been our
escorte
in our
visits
to the
sick
. I find money and
he finds
physic
, and I do
assure
you we are
both very well
pleased
with our
several
departments
.
Besides
you cannot think how
the doctor is
rising
in reputation,
since
his
appearance is
so
mended. He is now often
seen
coming out of the doors of the wealthy,
which I hope
presages
he will one day become
wealthy
himself
.
13th
.
I am extremely flurried and vexed, indeed
I think my evil genius prevailed, when
Rooksby
first
formed an acquaintance with
Belger. The man is an unprincipled
libertine
,
and Amelia was greatly
mistaken
,
when
she
imagined any tie however
sacred
,
would be
restriction
upon his licentious
passion
.
Rooksby
had rode out
last
evening, Amelia
was reading to Mrs.
Rooksby
, and I
imagining
Belger was with my
husband
, took a
book in my hand and
strolled
out to indulge
a contemplative mood, which at that time
prevailed over my mind. I rambled
farther
than I at
first
intended, and before
I was aware of it, the
shades
of night came
on.The evening was remarkably fine,
the moon
arose
veiled in a fleecy cloud,
which
served
only to
increase
the glory it
could not hide; a gentle zephyr
whispered
through the trees, and I felt a
sensation
of gratitude, wonder and delight pervade
my
soul
;
whilst
admiring, I beheld the
beauty of the
surrounding
scene
, at the top
of a walk at no great
distance
from the
house
,
but on a little eminence, there is a
summerhouse
greatly admired by all the family for
the charming view it commands of an
extensive
well cultivated country. In this place
I had been working in the morning, and in
passing
it, recollected I had left my
work-bag
there, in which was
something
I wanted.
I therefore
stepped
in with a
design
of
bringing
it away. The moon
shone
through the
windows full upon an organ which was
placed
there for me to entertain
myself
with,
and as I am fond of
solemn
music
, the
stillness
of the evening and the
serenity
of every
surrounding
object
inspired
me with a
wish
to touch the
instrument
. I therefore
sat
down, and following the
impulse
of my
soul
,
began the following Hymn to Gratitude:
Where'er I turn my
ravish
'd eyes,
New
scenes
of beauty round me
rise
,
My heart exulting glows;
And While I view the wond'rous whole,
To the Creative Power my
soul
,
With gratitude o'erflows.
You burning orbs, that round the pole,
In
solemn
grand
succession
roll,
Declare their Maker's power;
Then while
such
glories deck the
sky
,
Can
such
a weak frail worm as I
But
worship
and adore.
Father of all thou
dost
bestow
On us poor reptiles here below,
Each good we're taught to prize;
And tho'
sometimes
we feel thy frown,
The truly grateful heart
must
own
Thy judgments
just
and
wise
.
Hail, Gratitude,
celestial
guest
,
Come make thy
mansion
in my
breast
,
Thou
spark
of love divine;
Inspir
'd by Thee, tho' troubles
rise
,
My
soul
shall
mount toward the
skies
,
And heaven
itself
be mine.
I had
sung
it over once, and was
just
repeating
the
last
stanza
with all the real
fervour
which at that moment warmed my
soul
,
when hearing a
footstep
, I turned round
and
saw
Mr. Belger enter the
summer
house
.
So you are returned,
said
I,
rising
from
my
seat
; but pray where is
Rooksby
.
I have not been with him, replied
Belger, nor do I think he is returned. I
have been enjoying a far greater
pleasure
,
than any he can meet with abroad. I have
been
listening
to your charming voice, which
with
such
enthusiastic
fervour, has been
pouring
forth the grateful emotions of your
soul
.
I have been here
some
time,
said
I
carelessly
, and I believe it is getting late.
vol. iii. K
Pray do not let me interrupt your intended
ramble; but I am afraid of taking cold
should
I remain here any longer.
You
must
not go,
dearest
,
loveliest
of
women, I cannot
lose
this only opportunity
which I have had of
speaking
to you without
observation
. Hear me, pity me! From the
first
moment, that I beheld you, my heart
has known neither joy nor peace. In every
place, in every hour,
sleeping
or waking,
your image
still
pursues
me. I love, I doat
to
madness
and yet have only the hope of
exciting your
compassion
.
My contempt
sir
, you certainly excite,
by this unparalled effrontery. I thought Mr.
Belger had received my
answer
on this
subject
some
years
since
, and am
surprized
however
,
he then dared to
insult
an unprotected
girl, that he
should
suppose
he might with
impunity now repeat
those
insults
to the wife
of his friend.
He
listened
not to what I was
saying
, but
placing
himself
between me and the door,
forcibly
seized
my hands, and was
proceeding
to the
most
romantic
professions
of
platonic
love, when I
saw
Mr.
Rooksby
coming
up the walk. Agitated and
distressed
beyond
measure
, I cried cruel,
persecuting
Belger,
you have
exeposed
me to the
suspicions
of
my
husband
, who
must
suppose
a guilty
assignation
has been the
cause
of our being
alone here at this late hour. I had not time
to
say
more. Mr.
Rooksby
entered. why,
my dear Meriel
said
he, do you
stay
out
thus late
exposing
yoursef
to the dews of
the evening, then perceiving Belger, he
added, but you have company with you,
and, perhaps, I intrude on an agreeable
tete-a-tete
. I endeavoured to
compose
my
agitated
spirits
, and
answer
him in a
style
of
raillery; but it was
impossible
. I
discovered
by the manner in which he
spoke
, that the
unhappy
jealousy
of his temper was
awakened
,
and that it would not be an
easy
matter
to convince him, his
suspicions
were without
foundation, I trembled, as I took hold of his
arm; and we proceeded in
silence
to the
house
. When we entered, my mother
tenderly
expressed
her anxiety and fears of my
having taken cold, Amelia too gently chid
me for playing truant as
she
called it. I do not
know how I looked, but I am
sure
I felt very
disagreeably
. Indeed, the raillery of Amelia,
the cold
reserve
of
Rooksby
, and the
humiliating
glances of Belger
so
powerfully
affected
my feelings; that I pleaded
indisposition
and retired to my apartment, where I have
given vent to my tears, and in
some
measure
eased
my heart, by relating the
cause
of my
uneasiness
to my friendly Celia. I fear,
it will be long before
Rooksby
will again
look on me with
tenderness
; and when I
recollect, the manner of my leaving Mrs.
Rooksby
and Amelia, the length of time I
was
absent
, and my being found at
so
late
an hour in the
summer
house
with Belger,
who no doubt had
also
been rambling about
for
some
time, though we had but that
moment
met. All
these
circumstances
must
tend to make me appear guilty of
impropriety
,
if not imprudence. Again and again
I repeat it. Belger
seems
doomed to be the
bane of my
happiness
.
Amelia has
just
been with me. I informed
her of the
cause
I had for
uneasiness
. She
blamed me for retiring
so
early,
saying
it
gave me an appearance of
conscious
guilt,
though
she
was fully
sensible
that every
thought of my heart was purity
itself
;
she
bade me
assume
an air of
cheerfulness
, as
she
was afraid that the timid
embarrassment
that
modesty
and real innocence ever
discovers
,
when glanced on by the eye of
suspicion
,
would only tend to
encrease
the doubts
Rooksby
already harboured. But I hear
him coming. I
must
quit my pen and retire
to bed, though greatly I fear, not to
rest
.
14th.
When
Rooksby
entered the apartment, a
mixture of
sorrow
, anger and
distress
sat
on
his countenance.I thought, madam,
said
he, you were
indisposed
, as you retired
so
early; but I
see
you are not in bed yet;
but agreeable meditation is certainly more
pleasing
, than the company of
those
we
dislike
.
Pray do not let me
disturb
your
reverie
.You
speak
in riddles, Mr.
Rooksby
.
Whose
company did you
suppose
I fled from,
when I left the parlour. Solitude, indeed,
was more agreeable than to be in company,
and
witness
the frown of
displeasure
that
sat
on your countenance. It was not the
headach
impelled me to retire; it was a pain
more acute.I could not proceed, but
laying my hand on my
bosom
, the
involuntary
tear choaked my utterance.
My beloved Meriel,
said
he,
sitting
down by me, and
speaking
in a
softened
accent,
do not weep.
Those
precious tears would
melt a heart of adamant: think then, how
much they
must
distress
one who glows with
unutterable
tenderness
toward you.
Ah
Rooksby
, why, if you really
experience
such
tender emotions in my favour,
why have you wounded my heart, by
uttering
such
unkind, I may
say
, cruel
suspicions
.
Meriel,
said
he, looking at me
intently
,
did you not
confess
you knew Belger
some
time
since
at
Kensington
.
Most
assuredly
, I did.
And during the time of your
acquaintance
there, did he never
express
his
admiration
his
esteem
his love to you.
How can you
ask
such
a
question
? He
was at that time
Married, you would
say
, cried he,
interrupting
me, but I know he was not, and
I remember hearing him once
speak
of a
beautiful creature, he knew at that place,
who had more power over his heart than all
the
rest
of the
sex
put together.
And therefore, it follows,
said
I, that
I
must
be the
person
he meant (attempting
a
smile
.) My dear
Rooksby
, if you have
such
an opinion of your Meriel's attractions,
she
has a far more humble one of
herself
.
But you had certainly been indulging
him, this evening, with a long
tete-a-tete
.
You are
mistaken
, He had not been
in the
summer
house
above three minutes
before you joined us.
There is
such
an ingenuous
frankness
in your manner, dear girl, that it would
be
almost
a crime to doubt of your
sincerity
.
Yet when I reflect
In
saying
this, he
started
up and
striking
his forehead with his hand, he cried,
these
doubts will
unsettle
my
reason
I was
terrified
,
and
rising
from my
seat
endeavoured
to
sooth
him. He took my hand and
pressing
it to his lips,
said
, I cannot credit
aught to your
disadvantage
. Your
countenance
is
so
expressive
of innocence, that it
is
impossible
to believe you
otherwise
.
Forgive
my ungenerous conduct. It is the fault
of my nature. Forget it, and I will be
careful
how I offend again. You may be
sure
,
I was not backward in
promising
a total
forgetfulness
of this painful event: but I am
sensible
, my dear Celia, it is
impossible
to
keep my
promise
, for though we all met this
morning in the
same
social
manner as
usual
,
I felt
such
a
restraint
upon
myself
whenever
Belger
addressed
me, and
answered
the
most
trifling
questions
with
such
evident
imbarassment
,
that to even an indifferent
spectator
I
must
have appeared
strangely
agitated.
Indeed, my friend, I began to
wish
I had
not concealed from Mr.
Rooksby
any thing,
that
passed
during my
residence
at
Kensington
.
If I had informed him of Belger's
unprincipled
behaviour to me at that place he
might not have renewed his intimacy, but I
always have an objection to relating any tale
whereof I am
myself
the heroine, and in
this point I avoided it, fearing to incur the
imputation of vanity, and in
so
doing, I have
incurred that of guilt.To mention
these
circumstances
now would be
impossible
, as
it would only tend to confirm
Rooksby
's
suspicions
, perhaps engage him in a quarrel
with Belger and by making it a public affair,
cast
a
blemish
on my reputation, which no
future conduct will ever wipe off. But I think
through the whole
course
of my life I have
been particularly unfortunate in having my
most
innocent actions
misconstrued
, and
though my own
bosom
conceals not a
wish
which does not tend to the
universal
happiness
of mankind in general. I have never
wanted
enemies, who are ever ready to catch at
the errors, to which frail mortality is liable;
and magnify them into crimes.I have
however a
sweet
consolation
Celia. My heart
is
conscious
of its own integrity and relies on
that Power, who knows its innocence to
support
it through every trial, which in His
wisdom
He may
see
proper to lay upon it. This
is a
consolation
of which no afflicton,
however
severe
, can rob me.
Mrs.
Rooksby
is I fear, in a declining
state
of health. Age and its attendant
infirmities
bend her frame to the earth; but
her mind is
still
in full vigour. She is the
same
pious,
resigned
chearful
christian
, as
ever: and her company is equally
sought
by
the young as well as by
those
more nearly
of her own years. A journey to the
south
of France is judged
necessary
for her the
ensuing
winter. Mr.
Rooksby
does not
wish
to leave England;
so
I have not hinted my
desire
of accompanying her. Indeed, my
present
situation
would render travelling
dangerous
,
Amelia goes with her, and I mean
to invite
Susan
Mossop
to
spend
the winter
with me in town, not that I expect to reap
much
pleasure
from her
society
; but I think
a
residence
in my family may be of
service
to her; and
should
any proper match offer,
the want of a fortune
shall
not be an
obstacle
,
Adieu my friend, your's ever.
MERIEL.
LETTER XLVIII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Oak-hall
,
October
9
th
, 1783.
Surely
,
surely
, my friend, I was born
to be the
sport
of fortune; for truly
can I
say
with the Poet,
That e'er the cup of joy could reach my lips,
'Twas
dash
'd with gall.
I had but
just
began to
taste
the
supreme
felicity
of
domestic
happiness
, had began to
look forward to
rising
years of peace and
comfort, when this Belger, like a demon of
cruelty appears, and all my
pleasing
prospects
vanish
Like
some
poor traveller, whom Merlin leads
Thro' fragrant bowers and delicious meads;
And while his feet the magic paths
pursue
,
And while he thinks the fair
illusion
true
The
baseless
vision
melts in fluid air,
And woods and wilds and thorny ways appear.
Yes, my beloved friend, the
sweet
enchanting
scenes
of
happiness
now
sade
upon my
fight, and like the
delusive
vision
of a
disordered
imagination,
serves
only to make the
surrounding
desolate
prospect
, the more dark
and gloomy.
From the time of my
last
letter, Mrs.
Rooksby
's health has evidently become
worse
and
worse
every day;
so
that we were
obliged to
hasten
her departure for the
continent
,
as the
physicians
feared the cold
autumnal
blasts
would be too much for her
enervated frame to bear. We were
busy
in
preparing for her departure, when one
evening
just
as the
sun
was
set
, a little girl came
and informed me a poor tenant of our's
was taken
suddenly
ill, and
wished
very
much to
see
me.As Amelia was
busy
in her own apartment, I would not
interrupt
her to
request
her company; but
taking
some
cordials with me and bidding
Thomas follow, I took hold of the little girl
and bid her lead me to the cottage. When
I arrived the poor woman told me
she
had
been
seized
with a
sudden
fit, and imagining
herself
dying
she
had
sent
for me to
recommend
her children to my care; but as
she
now found
herself
much better,
she
humbly
hoped I would pardon the trouble
she
had
given me. As I had walked very quick, I
found
myself
somewhat
fatigued and
sat
down for a few moments to
rest
.
Whilst
I
sat
, I
busied
myself
in making enquiries
concerning the poor woman's family, and
learnt that
she
had
seven
children and a very
bad
husband
.I have been in a deal of
trouble, madam,
said
she
, Robin has
been very idle this
summer
and had gotten
himself
in debt; but we were relieved from
our
necessities
by a gentleman, who is I
believe
,
at the Hall; for the children
say
they
have
seen
him there. Oh! madam, he has
been the
preserver
of me and mine, and I
am bound to pray for his
prosperity
. She
was eagerly proceeding, when
casting
my
eye toward the window, I
saw
Belger open
the wicket, which
served
for a gate, and
come in.Here is your benefactor coming
good woman
said
I, and
slipping
two
guineas
into her hand, went toward the door,
but was not quick enough to
escape
, before
Belger entered.
Bless
me my fair
hostess
,
said
he, in an accent of
surprise
; who
could have thought of
seeing
you here; not
that it is
surprising
to
see
Mrs.
Rooksby
in
the cottage of poverty
sweetly
alleviating its
attendant evils, but the
lateness
of the hour
and to
see
her without
Miss
Sidney.
Amelia was engaged,
said
I
endeavouring
to
pass
him, and indeed, I did not
observe
how late it was.
You will permit me to
see
you home?
By no means Mr. Belger. I have my
servant
with me.
Do not,
dearest
madam, deny me the
selicity
of walking by your
side
and enjoying
a few moments uninterrupted
conversation
,
a
blessing
I cannot obtain at the hall.
Nor can I think,
sir
, you have any thing
to
say
to me, to which the whole world might
not be a
witness
, I
desire
you will
suffer
me
to go home alone. I have particular
reasons
.
I know your
reasons
,
most
lovely,
most
injured of women.
Rooksby
is jealous,
weary of the
possession
of the
most
inestimable
treasure
, he
seeks
by
accusing
your
spotless
purity to
excuse
his own errors.
Stop, Belger, I will
listen
no longer,
Rooksby
is too
just
to
suspect
the integrity
of a heart, with
whose
very emotion he is
acquainted. As to errors I neither
suspect
him capable of any; derogatory to his own
honour or prejudicial to our mutual
happiness
;
and know,
sir
, the
person
who would
endeavour to awaken
suspicion
in my
bosom
,
will be ever held as an object of contempt
and
detestation
.
VOL. III. L
I then darted at him a look
expressive
of
my
honest
indignation, and endeavoured to
quit the
house
: but he threw
himself
on his
knees before me, and forcibly taking my
hand
earnestly
requested
to be heard for only
one moment. From the
instant
Belger
first
entered, the woman had from a motive of
respect
left the room, and my
servant
was
without
side
the gate, waiting for my coming
out.
I was
hesitating
for an
answer
, by which
I might hope to make him
relinquish
his
design
;
when I heard my
husband
's voice
enquiring
of the
servant
, whom he was
waiting for?
My
miseress
,
sir
, replied the man.
Your
mistress
is here thenand who is
with her?
Mr. Belger went in a few moments
since
.
Damnation! exclaimed he, and
pushing
by the man with violence
instantly
rushed
into the
house
. How I looked, or what I
said
, I cannot pretend to determine, but of
this I am certain my feelings were
undescribable
.
It is well, madam,
said
he, I have
at length
discovered
the true
cause
of your
frequent rambles toward this cottage, and by
heavens.Rage choaked him, I
summoned
all my
resolution
and endeavoured to calm
his agitated
spirits
.
Frequent rambles, Mr.
Rooksby
, I do
not
understand
you; I never was at this
cottage
before, nor
should
have come now had
I not been
sent
for.
I know you were
sent
for. That is the
very thing that drives me to
madness
. Oh!
Meriel, to think on the very
last
evening
before
my mother and
Miss
Sidney leaves
England
,
you could quit them and taking
advantage
of my
absence
fly on the wings of love
to meet your abandoned
seducer
. But, this
is no time for argument; tell me, thou vile
reptile, who under the
mask
of
friendship
hast
dishonoured
me, what reparation can
you make for the peace you have
destroyed
,
for the purity you have fullied?
Dear
Rooksby
, (
said
Belger in a tone
of
dissembling
gentleness
,) you are carried
away by a wild ungovernable
passion
, I give
you my honour I had not been in the
house
ten minutes when you entered; nor had I
the
most
distant
idea of meeting Mrs.
Rooksby
here, you iujure her by
these
unjust
suspicions
,
and what ought to be at this time a
material
consideration
, you agitate her
spirits
,
impair her health and endanger her valuable
life.
Belger
said
my
husband
, with a voice
that made me tremble, you are both a
coward
and a villain.
You cannot mean what you
say
.
I do, reiterated
Rooksby
, fiercely.
Then,
sir
, to-morrow between five and
six
o'clock, I
shall
expect to
see
you in a
proper place to
settle
this difference. But
remember
Rooksby
, I warn you of the
remorse
that will
seize
you, when you
discover
how
injuriously
you have treated both your
wife and friend.
Belger,
said
I exerting all the
firmness
I was
mistress
of, and laying my hand on
his arm, as I
spoke
.If you are not
callous
to the voice of humanity, explain this
horrid
mystery
, for I am certain the accidents
of this night have been concerted to ruin me
in the opinion of my
husband
. You call
yourself
his friend. How well you
deserve
that title your own
conscience
can
best
inform
you, that and the all-
seeing
eye of a
just
providence
knows my innocence, and I
trust
,
it will hereafter, be made appear clear as the
noon day
sun
. In the mean time, dare not
as you value your eternal welfare, to lift
your impious hand
against
the life of
Rooksby
;
or, by throwing
yourself
in the way of
danger, run the hazard of
rushing
unprepared
into the
presence
of your offended Maker,
for let honour give it what
false
gloss
it will,
the man, who wantonly throws away his life
is as much guilty of
suicide
, as the wretch
who ends his
existence
with a loaded
pistol
.
And in the
case
of duelling
vanquish
or be
vanquished
, you are equally a murderer. Go,
leave us, would to heaven, I could
say
to
that peace which was uninterrupted, till your
arrival here.Return to London, or go any
where;
so
as I may not have the weight of
bloodshed
to drag my
almost
broken
spirit
to the earth.
Rooksby
started
up with fury and
snatching
my hand from off Belger's arm, cried
by heavens you tremble only for him. So
as he is
safe
you care not what becomes of
me. But come, madam, let us return, it
is
almost
dark. As he
said
this, he pulled
me redely from my
seat
. I attempted to
walk; but terror had unnerved my limbs.
I
sunk
down again on the chair, and had
L2
not a flood of tears relieved me, I
must
have
fainted. He was alarmed and called the
woman to bring
some
water, and
saying
he
would
send
the carriage to fetch me as I was
unable to walk,he went out, followed by
Belger in
sullen
silence
. When he was gone,
my agitation became
so
great, it threw
me
almost
into
hysterics
. I was not
sufficiently
mistress
of my recollection to
ask
the
woman any
questions
, but gave vent to my
overcharged heart in a torrent of
unrestrained
affliction, and when the carriage arrived,
threw
myself
into it
almast
distracted
with
the violence of my emotions, where, to my
great comfort, I found my kind
soothing
friend Amelia. I related to her what had
just
happened;
she
comforted me all that
lay in her power, and told me Belger had
retired to his apartment immediately on
entering the
house
, and that
Rooksby
went
to the library, where he was
busy
writing.
She
said
she
would endeavour to
see
the
former
before
she
went to
rest
, and
persuade
him to
set
off for London, entreated me to
hide my
uneasiness
from Mrs.
Rooksby
, as
her weak
state
of health would but ill
support
the
shock
of
such
intelligence, when
she
supposed
us the
happiest
of the hymenial
votaries, and lamented her being obliged to
leave me in
so
disagreeable
a
situation
.
I thanked the dear friendly girl; but
entreated
her not to be
uneasy
;
said
she
could
not perform to me a more acceptable
service
than by attending to the welfare of my
mother
,
promised
to be guided by her advice
and bear my afflictions with patience.
And
so
I will, my dear Celia; for have I
not
conscious
innocence for my
support
, and
is it not my duty to
submit
without repining,
to the will of Him, who never lays on his
creatures the rod of affliction but for
some
wife
purpose
. He can humble the frail body
to the
dust
the more to exalt the
soul
. He
can
cause
the bones that he has broken to
rejoice, and heal the broken heart. I feel
his mercies at this moment abound in the
comforts of an approving
conscience
. I
acknowledge
his judgments
just
, and pray only
for
meekness
and
resignation
to bear his
dispensations
as I ought.
Celia, I
must
break off, I am ill; when
able I will again continue my narrative,
beaven
bless
you.
MERIEL.
LETTER XLIX.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
Nov.
29
th
, 1783.
I have
been extremely ill
since
I
last
addressed
my dear Celia,
occasioned
by the
violent agitation my
spirits
had undergone.
The morning after the
disagreeable
rencounter
mentioned in my
last
, I found
myself
much
indisposed
; but as it was the day intended
for Mrs.
Rooksby
's departure, I
arose
at the
usual
time and endeavoured to appear as
chearful as
possible
, that the dear old lady
might not perceive the
distress
of my mind.
Rooksby
seemed
inspired
with the
same
wish
and though he had not
spoken
to me during
the whole night, yet at
breakfast
assumed
his
usual
tenderness
of manner. It was with
infinite
pleasure
I learnt that Belger had
set
out for town long before any of the family
were
stirring
, leaving only a card to my
mother pleading urgent
business
as his
excuse
for
so
precipitate a departure, and
wishing
her intended journey might have the
desired
effect and
restore
her to perfect health. At
twelve o'clock the chariot drew up to the
doorI felt my
spirits
sink
. I looked
first
at my dear Amelia, then at my mother, and
taking a hand from each,
pressed
them to
my heart and
burst
into tears. It was in
vain any longer to hide my
sorrows
I
saw
these
invaluable friends departing from me
at the very moment when I
most
wanted their
soothing
attentions. I looked on my
generous
benefactress
, perhaps, for the
last
time.
Her wan cheek and emaciated frame, too
plainly announced her approaching
dissolution
.
I threw my arms round herI
endeavoured
to articulate an adieubut words
were denied me.God
bless
you, my dear
child,
said
she
. Clement, be tender of
hercomfort her
study
her felicityand
may Heaven
shower
its
choicest
blessings
on
you both. She then took up my little
Clementina, and letting fall a tear as
she
pressed
the
smiling
Cherub to her
bosom
,
cried emphatically, Oh thou
sweet
angel!
Heaven grant that you may live to be an
honour to your father and a
blessing
to your
mother
mayest
thou be endowed with all
her virtues without any of his faults. She
then once more embraced me and went to
the carriage. Amelia
stayed
behind a
moment
to comfort and re-
assure
me. She bid
me keep up my
spirits
and
trust
in that
Power
for
support
, who never yet
forsook
the
innocent.
Rooksby
accompanied them
some
miles
on
horse
back. I followed the chariot with
my eyes as long as I could, and then
retiring
to my chamber, threw
myself
on the
bed, and gave a
loose
to unutterable
sorrow
.
However the
spirit
may be afflicted, nature
exhausted
by various conflicts will
insensibly
sink
under the balmy influence of
sleep
.
This was my
case
: I
slept
about two hours,
but awoke
unrefreshed
, and in acute pain.
My head ached, my tongue was parched,
and I had every
symptom
of an approaching
fever. However I endeavoured to
rise
and
dress
, to be ready to receive
Rooksby
, as
he
proposed
returning to dinner: but to this
task
I was unequal. My head was giddy and
my limbs trembled.
Hester
, my woman,
was alarmed. She rang for the
house
-maid,
who
just
came in time to help to
support
me; for in attempting to go from my
bedchamber
to the
dressing
-room, I had fainted.
On recovering, I found much
worse
consequences
were to be apprechended, than I had
at
first
imagined. I
sent
immediately for
medical
assistance
and about four o'clock the
next morning, I was delivered of a dead
child. For
some
hours I was totally
insenble
,
and for more than a week my life was
despaired
of.
Rooksby
was frequent in his
enquiries after my health; but I could
plainly
perceive, he thought more of the
loss
of
his
son
than my evidently dangerous
situation
.
However it
pleased
Heaven to
restore
me, though by
slow
degrees, and the
moment
the
physicians
pronounced me able to
bear the fatigue of travelling, I
set
off for
London, vainly hoping that variety of
scenes
,
company and public
amusements
would
restore
in
some
measure
my
lost
chearfulness
;
at
least
I thought it would
banish
those
corroding
reflections which gnawed and goaded
my poor lacerated heart. Oh! my beloved
Celia,
Rooksby
no longer retains the
smallest
degree of affection for me. In company
he is polite, but
distant
; when by
ourselves
(which is indeed but
seldom
) he is cold,
unkind
,
and my Celia will hardly believe it, he
once on my gently
remonstrating
on this
painful change,
struck
me, nay
cursed
me,
and called me by a name, my
soul
shudders
to think on. That he hates and
despises
the
woman he once doated on is now become
too evident to be doubted; for he has never
returned to my apartment
since
my
illness
,
but occupies one in another part of the
house
.
Susan
Mossop
is with me. She is
possessed
of more
tenderness
and
goodness
of heart
than I at
first
suspected
. She labours
incesantly
to
amuse
me, and though I cannot
partake of her
chearfulness
, I am grateful
for her attention.
Hester
is married to a
man of genteel fortune, but from what I can
judge of the character of both, I think they
will
pass
that kind of
insipid
life
so
well
described
by Prior in his epitaph on
sauntering
Jack and idle Joan.
Nor
wished
, nor cared, nor laughed nor cried,
And
so
they lived, and
so
they died.
I am
just
returned from an airing in Hyde
Park, and have been greatly
astonished
to
see
Clara there, whom I left in
Devonshire
.
She was on
horse
-back, elegantly mounted
and attended by a
servant
in livery. A
confused
idea ran through my mind, when I
first
saw
her, yet
surely
she
can never add
ingratitude to infamy, by
seducing
the
affections
of the
husband
, when
she
has been
rescued
from want and
misery
by the wife,
yet, what can have brought her to town, or
how is it
possible
she
can afford to appear in
the manner
just
described
.
I am
satisfied
Rooksby
must
still
hold
some
intercourse
with Clara. We have
just
had
a
tete-a-tete
in which he
accused
me of
deceiving
him, of giving him my hand when
my heart was devoted to another; and of
having been long acquainted with Belger,
with whom it was well known, I had an
illicit
intercourse
.
Dearest
Celia, imagine
the agonizing feelings of my heart on being
subject
to
such
unjust
,
such
cruel
suspicions
.
It was in vain I attempted to
assert
my
innocence
;
he was well informed, he
said
, of every
incident that had
passed
during my
residence
at
Kensington
; that I had been the intimate
acquaintance of women of light characters;
that my own conduct in regard to Belger
was
notoriously
infamous, and that I was in
reality the exact
reverse
of what I had
speciously
appeared to his mother, or
she
never
would
so
strenuously
have
pressed
our union.
Oh! my friend, would to heaven, I had
trusted
to the dictates of my own judgment,
had been guided by the
impulse
of my heart
which
strongly
urged me to reject this man;
but
compassion
, gratitude, and the combined
wishes
of
those
whom I
most
loved and
respected
,
operated
so
powerfully on my
feelings
,
that I was unable to
withstand
their
solicitations
; and Heaven be my
witness
,
I have not in one
instance
since
I have been
united to
Rooksby
infringed the
smallest
duty incumbent on the
sacred
character of
wife. A letterit is from Amelia, Heaven
grant no ill news.Read it Celia, I
inclose
it for your
perusal
, and wonder not that
vol. iii. M
my
fast
salling
tears oblige me to bid you
adieu!
MERIEL.
LETTER L.
AMELIA to MERIEL.
Aix-la-Chapelle
,
Nov.
9
th
, 1783.
It
is with infinite regret, I take up my pen
to inform my dear friend, that the
flattering
appearance of Mrs.
Rooksby
's
returning
health, which had
so
elated my
spirits
are entirely
vanished
, and an
encreasing
debility of frame, baffles all the
skill
of the
physicians
and alarms us to an imminent
degree
.
My mind is in
such
a
state
of painful
anxiety, that I hardly know what I write.
When I am
present
with the dear invalid, I
endeavour to command my feelings and
appear
chearful, but the effort is vain, and
when I contemplate her pale, yet placid
countenance, the tears will involuntarily
burst
from my eyes. She, this morning,
observing
my emotions, called me to the
bedside
, (from which
she
is now
scarcely
able to
rise
, even while it is making) and
taking
my hand, my dear
Miss
Sidney,
said
she
, do not let my approaching
dissolution
give you pain.I
see
it draw near with no
other
apprehension
than what frail mortality
must
feel, when called from a temporal to an
eternal
state
, into the immediate
presence
of
the Creator of the
Universe
!I have had my
span
lengthened out far beyond what I had
ever expected.I feel no regret at leaving
this
transitory
life;for my only care was
centered in the
happiness
of my
son
, and him
I
shall
leave happy in the affection of the
best
,
the
worthiest
of her
sex
. I know my
beloved
Meriel will feel my
loss
: But time
will mitigate her affliction and
she
will bear
it with the fortitude of a
christian
. I have
one thing to mention, which nearly
concerns
your
happiness
. I have a nephew
here whom you have
seen
Captain
Onslow
is a man every way worthy the
esteem
of a
woman of
sense
. He is not
insensible
to the
merit of
Miss
Sidney, and has
requested
me
to plead his
cause
. I flatter
myself
you will
not
refuse
his
suit
.She
paused
. I was
silent
. I had frequently
seen
and admired
Captain
Onslow
: he is in the
East
-India
service
; for though a man of fortune, he
prefers a life of activity to one of
supine
indolence
.
An indifferent
state
of health,
brought him to Aix-la-Chapelle; but being
now perfectly recovered, he
proposed
rejoining
his regiment, which it is expected will
be ordered to Bengal the
ensuing
season
.
I
should
not be thus particular, but
knowing
from
some
disagreement
between Mr.
Rooksby
and the Captain, you were totally
ignorant that you had
such
a relation, and
therefore might
wish
some
information. I
had without vanity
reason
to
suspect
the
Captainss
partiality; nor can I with truth
assert
, that my
bosom
felt that indifference
toward him, which it had ever maintained
toward the
rest
of his
sex
. Yet Mrs.
Rooksby
taking me at a moment
so
unprepared,
I
hesitated
, and knew not what to
answer
.
She
saw
my
confusion
and then continued,
I have in my will left you a
small
token of
my regard, which if you
listen
to
Onslow
's
suit
, I
shall
insist
on
seeing
settled
on
yourself
,
if it is not painful, my dear Amelia,
I could
wish
to hear your candid
sentiments
on this
subject
, and it would give me
infinite
satisfaction
to
see
you united to
so
worthy a man before I breathe my
last
; as the
welfare of every one dear to my charming
daughter-in-law
must
ever
interest
my
fondest
solicitude
. I thanked the generous woman
in terms of heartfelt gratitude,
assured
her I
was perfectly happy in my
present
situation
,
but that if it was my fate to change, I knew
of no
person
I
should
prefer to Captain
Onslow
.
My only objection would be the
difference
subsisting
between him and Mr.
Rooksby
, as I feared it would prevent that
social
intercourse
that I
must
ever
wish
to
continue uninterrupted between Mrs.
Rooksby
and
myself
. I will obviate that objection
my dear,
said
she
, for it
shall
be my
last
request
to Clement that all
animosity
be
laid
aside
, as he values my
blessing
. And
now, continued
she
, with a faint
smile
,
there remains nothing to be done but for
you to take your pen and bid my
son
and
his amiable wife to your nuptials. The
jaunt will be of
service
to Meriel after her
late
illness
, and
she
will have the double
pleasure
of
seeing
her beloved friend enter into
an honourable and happy marriage, and me
into a
state
of
everlasting
bliss
; and tell her
from me
she
should
celebrate the two events
as equally joyful. Oh! my dear madam,
said
I, in an agony of grief, do not talk
thus, I hope you will recover.
Impossible
,
said
she
, waving her hand
with a
solemn
yet benignant look, I have
M 2
enquired of the
physicians
how long they
suppose
I can remain. They informed me,
yesterday
, I may
possibly
continue three
weeks or a month longer; but that is the
utmost
; therefore my dear Amelia,
lose
no
time. I could
wish
to
see
my dear children
once more, and I am certain the bare
mention
of that
wish
will be
sufficient
to bring
them eagerly to me.
Thus, my dear Meriel, have I executed
the
desire
of my
almost
expiring
benefactress
;
hasten
to me my friend that we may pour
our affliction into each others
bosom
, and
by participation lighten the burthen that will
press
so
heavy on our hearts. I flatter
myself
the death-bed of an amiable and
respected
parent will have a good effect on the mind
of your unkind truant, and bring him back to
a
sense
of the
happiness
he is wantonly trifling
away. I
trust
you will
use
all
possible
expedition
.
I have agreable to Mrs.
Rooksby
's
desire
wrote to her
son
requesting
his immediate
acquiescence
with her
wish
. Oh! my dear
Meriel, my mind is
sorely
oppressed
, I
shrink
from the thought of uniting
myself
to Captain
Onslow
at the very moment, when tears of
real
sorrow
will dim the
lustre
of the
hymenial
torch: but your better judgment
shall
in this and every particular direct that of
your
AMELIA SIDNEY.
LETTER LI.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Paris
,
January
29
th
, 1784.
From this great theatre of
dissipation
and
folly does Meriel once more
address
her friend
but why am I not permitted to
see
you?
why in the
same
kingdom does
indispensible
duties keep me from flying to you, and in
your peaceful
cloister
burying
myself
at once
from the world and all its
sorrows
? Alas I
too plainly feel that even there I could not
now be at peace: for thither
should
I carry
corroding thought, the pangs of
disappointed
love, the remembrance of
abused
confidence,
ingratitude and ill requited
friendship
.
Strange
scenes
have
passed
, my friend,
since
I
wrote you
last
; I have hovered on the brink
of eternity, from whence I was only
snatched
to be the victim of future
misery
; but let
me
pursue
some
method in my narrative and
carry you back to the time when the receipt
of Amelia's letter hurried us to proceed as
expeditiously
as
possible
to Aix to catch
the parting
sigh
and receive the dying
blessing
of my
last
dear parent, my more than
mother. Every preparation
necessary
for
our departure was
soon
made, when the
evening
previous to the day on which we were to
set
out,
Rooksby
came into my
dressing
room, where I was
busy
in making
some
necessary
arrangements with the
housekeeper
,
and bidding her quit the room
sat
down
beside
me, and looking with more complacency
than he had lately done, when
addressing
me,
said
, I have unknown to you Meriel
made a little addition to our party to the
continent, and flatter
myself
it will not be
disagreeable
.I believe I looked
surprized
when I replied, had our journey been one
of
pleasure
I could certainly have no
objection
to any
person
, whom he
should
think
proper to join us, but on
so
mournful an
occasion
I
must
suppose
the
presence
of a
stranger
It is not a
stranger
,
said
he (
interrupting
me eagerly,) it is poor Clara.
Clara,
sir
? in a tone of angry
surprize
.
Yes, my dear, he
answered
hesitatingly
,
She is in a bad
state
of health; I met her
lately by accident. She cannot well afford
so
long a journey; and it is a good
opportunity
.
Rooksby
said
I, fixing my eyes upon his
face: I think you know me well enough to
be certain that if Clara is really ill and in
want,
she
has a claim to every tender office
of humanity from me as a fellow-creature,
but
Nay, Meriel, no buts:
surely
(affecting
a
smile
) you are not jealous?No,
sir
,
you may
rest
quite
easy
on that head. I
cannot
think
so
meanly of you as to
suppose
after
what had
passed
you would again be the
dupe of an artful woman; for however my
compassion
may have been awakened toward
Clara, I cannot help thinking her a woman
capable of the
basest
duplicity.
She is going to be married to Belger,
said
he, endeavoring to hide his evident
embarrassment
under the
mask
of
carelessness
.
But I hope,
sir
, he is not to join us!
said
I, reddening with indignation at the
remembrance
of
past
injuries, which I could
now trace to their right
source
.
No, he will follow Clara to Aix, and
if my mother dies, we
shall
all
spend
the
winter
in Paris.
The evident
composure
with which he
mentioned
such
an afflicting
circumstance
,
cut me to the
soul
.You
speak
of your
mother with great indifference,
said
I, and
the tears
gushed
from my eyes.
Indifference, no, indeed I am extremely
sorry
; but you know, my dear,
she
is an
old woman, and we
must
expect it, and that
you know prepares us for the
stroke
, and
prevents the
shock
we
should
otherwise
feel. I have been thinking, continued he
after a little
pause
, that I
shall
have the
Hall pulled down next
summer
and built in
a more modern
stile
.
I turned from him with
silent
contempt
and
resting
my cheek upon my hand gave a
loose
to melancholy reflections. Celia I have
been deceived in this man. He has no heart,
no
sensibility
; every feeling of his
soul
is
absorbed
in
self
. Why, why was my fate
united to
such
a man. I was
roused
from
my reverie by a loud knock at the door.
That is Clara,
said
he,
starting
up. I
desired
she
would
sleep
here, that we might
be ready to
set
off together in the morning.
I felt a faint
chillness
seize
me as he
spoke
.
I believe my voice faultered as I
said
, go
down then and receive her; I will
just
take
one more look at my dear little girl and join
you immediately. When he had left the
room I
sunk
motionless
the
sopha
. Good
heaven,
said
I, and is it come to this. Can
it be
possible
, that the man whom I have
promised
to love and honour
should
thus forget
what is due to me, to his child and to
himself
?
But I will not judge too
rashly
,
continued
I,
rising
and drying my eyes.
Perhaps
they may not be guilty.
Jealousy
magnifies
every object, and
construes
even laudable
actions into crimes. I then
visited
the
nursery
and having
passed
a few minutes in
caressing
my little Clementina, I
descended
to the
drawing room where I found Clara
negligently
seated
on a
sopha
by
Rooksby
, and
Susan
Mossop
playing on the Piano Forte. Clara
rose
from her
seat
, coloured and
hesitatingly
said
something
about
intrusion
. I
confess
I
was not
less
embarrassed
myself
; however I
paid her the civilities
necessary
as being my
guest
and we immediately went to
supper
,
soon
after which I retired on pretence of
making
some
further preparations, and having
given orders about an apartment for Clara,
I
sat
down and wrote a few lines to
Susan
requesting
,
as
she
intended
staying
in town,
till
she
heared from us the
result
of our voyage
and whether we returned or
past
the winter
on the continent, that
she
would be
particularly
attentive to the child, and in
case
of
her father's
sending
for her begged
she
would
accompany her to Paris. This I did by
letter
,
being
sensible
I
should
have no time to
speak
to her in the morning; and I did not
think proper to
send
for her up
stairs
at that
time. Early in the morning our
post
coach
was at the door, and by
six
o'clock Mr.
Rooksby
, Clara,
myself
and
Lester
my
woman
were
seated
in it; and we proceeded
with all imaginable
speed
to Dover.
Rooksby
immediately on our arrival
sent
to
speak
to
the
master
of a Packet. We found it was
impossible
to think of embarking till the next
morning, and were informed by the man that
a gentleman and lady
just
arrived from
town had taken their
passage
on board his
vessel
. While we continued talking, a
gentle
tap at the door interrupted us, and on
its being opened who
should
enter but Mrs.
Kingly. It was a
most
agreeable
surprize
to me, though I believe not
so
to
Rooksby
.
Well met my dear
cousin
,
said
she
,
affectionately
saluting
me, it is fortunate
that we
should
both be travelling the
same
way. I
saw
your livery in the yard and
immediately
made my enquiries. Kingly is
gone out,
so
you
see
I took the opportunity
and eloped to you; but when he returns I
am
sure
he will be as happy as
myself
to pay
you his
respects
. While
she
was
speaking
she
did not notice who was in the room, and,
indeed, Clara
sat
in an
obscure
corner by the
fire, but as
she
finished
the
last
sentence
,
turning
hastily
round
she
saw
her; but not
recognizing her immediately cried, I fear
I am guilty of
rudeness
, you have company.
No one particular,
said
I. It is only
Mrs. Moreton. Clara was now under the
necessity
of
rising
; Mrs. Kingly
started
and
curtsying
formally, while
she
gave
Rooksby
a
most
expressive
look,
said
she
could not
have expected to
see
Mrs. Moreton in this
party, not knowing we were acquainted. I
really felt for Clara; her colour varied from
red to pale and from pale to red, till I thought
she
would have
sunk
.
Rooksby
looked
mortified
,
and I only
slightly
said
, that Mrs.
Moreton
having but indifferent health
wished
to try
the air and weather of Aix, and we having an
empty
seat
in the coach I had offered it to her.
Mrs. Kingly looked
inquisitive
, as much as
to
say
, do you know who
she
is. But
she
repressed
the
impulse
of
curiosity
and
made enquiries after my dear mother, whom
she
did not know till then, was in
so
dangerous
a
state
.
In about an hour Kingly came in, when
after the
first
salutations
were
past
, he
began
to recognize Clara, I think it would
be
impossible
to give you an adequate idea
of the anger and contempt that agitated his
expressive
countenance, her
presence
was
a
restraint
upon us all, it checked
conversation
,
we were for
some
moments
silent
and
embarrassed
she
saw
it and
guessing
the
vol. iii. N
cause
, complained of
weakness
and fatigue
and ringing for a light retired to her
chamber
.
She was no
sooner
gone than Kingly cried
why Mrs.
Rooksby
, how long have you
been acquainted with that woman.
Some time, I replied affecting as much
ease
as
possible
.
Had you any knowledge of her before
you were married?
O yes, I knew her very well; come I
know what you would
say
, but I
shall
stop
you at once; her former errors are nothing
to me; at
present
she
is in
distress
. It was
in my power to render her a trifling
service
,
and I only followed the dictates of
humanity
.
Neglecting
those
of common prudence,
interrupted he tartly.
Pshaw
!
nonsense
, I replied laughing,
do not let us talk any more about her.
You are the
most
unaccountable
woman
,
said
he, that ever
existed
, I declare
if
almost
half your life is not an inexplicable
riddle.
My dear,
said
Mrs. Kingly, to turn
the
conversation
, my
cousins
have taken
their
passage
in the
same
packet with us;
so
we
shall
cross
the channel together. This
had the
desired
effect; we
insensibly
fell into
mutual enquiries concerning the motives of
our intended voyage: the
conversation
became
by degrees cheerful, and Clara was for
the moment forgot. I found that Mr. and
Mrs. Kingly were merely on a jaunt of
pleasure
,
and that we
should
have their company
no farther than Calais, as they intended to
proceed to
Brussels
. But, my dear Celia,
vain are the appointments of man; we look
forward to many coming years, we mark out
plans of future
pleasure
and enjoyment: and
cry, Thus we will do, and thus. When
suddenly
the unexpected
blasts
of
adversity
pass
over us, the beauteous
vision
fades before
our
sight
, while
darkness
clouds and
tempest
shut
the expected joys forever from our view,
and hurl them far beyond our reach.
Like
some
poor hind, who during the
fatigues
of the day, had looked often
wishfully
toward a
distant
shady
grove, where he might
repose
from the
scorching
noon-day
sun
.
When my daily
task
is ended,
says
he,
I will retire there, and as I
rest
my weary
limbs, enjoy the cool
refreshing
breezes as
they
pass
over the banks of flowers.
These
reflections
sweeten
his toil, and he
tastes
a
thousand
times by anticipation the
pleasures
he expects to enjoy. At length the hour
arrives, he quits his labour and
hastily
flies
to the
scene
of fancy,
promised
bliss
. How
delightful is the cooling
shade
, he cries, as
he draws near the grove; how charming
the gurgling of the clear
stream
that glides
over the pebbles and falls into a
bason
formed
by nature; how delicious the fruit that hangs
from the trees and courts the hand to gather
them. Oh! I could live and die in
so
sweet
a place. How happy I
shall
be, when I reach
it, and
stretch
my weary limbs on the
soft
grassy
turf.Alas! poor
swain
,
dost
thou
not
see
the
sun
is
sunk
beneath the hills, the
gloom of evening comes on apace, and e'er
thou
canst
reach thy
desired
haven, the clouds
of night will
obscure
its beauties from thy
view, and the chilly dews prevent your
taking
the
repose
you
so
ardently
wish
for.
My dear Celia, I am at
present
unable to
proceed; when I recover my
spirits
, I will
again
resume
my pen, till then farewel.
MERIEL.
LETTER LII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
IN CONTINUATION.
Paris
,
January
30, 1784.
We
passed
the night as
proposed
at
Dover
,
and at an early hour were called
to go on board the packet, the wind and tide
both favouring us. We embarked before it
was well light, and the wind
freshening
as we
proceeded we were
soon
obliged to retire to
our cabins, being
seized
with the
sickness
incident to
those
, who are
unused
to the
boisterous
element.For
some
time we
were too ill to pay much attention to the
motion of the
vessel
, but at length I thought
it was very violent, and enquired of Kingly,
if it was
usual
to be
so
much
tossed
about in
crossing
the channel; his reply alarmed me;
the wind is changed,
said
he, and the
clouds threathen a
boisterous
day; we
shall
make good
sailors
of you all, for I do not
N 2
think you will reach Calais to-day, at
least
not till late in the evening.
Soon after this the wind
increased
to a
tremendous degree, and I
saw
by Kingly's
countenance that he was
uneasy
. He went
frequently upon deck; then returned to the
cabin, endeavoured to chear us, and
said
he
had
advised
the
Master
to turn back as the
wind was
so
much
against
us, and we
should
not feel the
surges
so
much, when we went
before it. Happy would it have been for us
all, if this advice had been taken while
day-light
remained; but the man was
obstinate
,
and continued beating about till nearly the
close
of day; then finding it
impossible
to
make his intended port, attempted to return
to Dover. As night came on, the
storm
increased
, and though
so
late in the
season
was attended with the
most
vivid lightning
and heavy claps of thunder; the
sea
was
unusually
agitated, the wind varying
almost
every
instant
and
resting
at no
settled
point.
It is
impossible
, my dear Celia, to give you
an adequate idea of the horrors of our
situation
in
so
small
a
vessel
, driving about at
the mercy of the waves and wind in a night,
the pitchy
darkness
of which was only
alleviated
by lightning, which
served
to give
us momentary views of the
surrounding
dangers
.
And how
shall
I tell my dear Celia,
that in the
midst
of this
distress
and terror,
I had one pang to encounter more acute by
far than the near approach of expected death.
Rooksby
attached
himself
entirely to Clara.
All his care, all his anxious
solicitude
was
expressed
for her. We had all
risen
from
our beds, Kingly
supported
his wife in his
arms. My dear boys,
said
she
,
Heaven
protect them.Heaven will
protect
us all, I hope my love,
said
he,
passing
his hand
across
his eyes.
Rooksby
sat
in a
distant
corner of the
cabin
beside
Clara, who
rested
her head
upon
his
shoulder
. Sad and
solitary
, I
supported
myself
against
a table, that was
fastened
to the cabin floor, and
resigning
myself
to that Power, who could in an
instant
either
rescue
us from impending death, or
plunge us at once into eternitythus gave
the reigns to reflection. Through every
scene
of my
past
life, how large has been
my portion of
misery
, and how
small
comparatively
,
my allotment of joy: then why,
coward
soul
,
dost
thou
shrink
from the
friendly
stroke
, that will
set
thee free from
the heavy clog of mortality, and lift thee
above
these
regions of
transitory
, fading
joys, to one where
pleasure
will be
immutable
,
unchangeable and can never end!Oh!
Almighty Father of the
Universe
, weary as
my pilgrimage has been, I acknowledge thy
mercies have been ever beyond my
deserts
;
to thee then do I commit
myself
do with
me as thou wiltonly; Oh! benignant
Creator
,
grant me a portion of
meekness
and
resignation
equal to my afflictions. Thou art
the Father of the
fatherless
; under thy
protecting
care my child will ever be
secure
.
Do thou never
forsake
her in the hour of
trial, and of thy mercy, grant
she
may never
forget thee. Forgive my manifold offences,
as from my
soul
I pardon every offence I
may have received from my fellow-creatures.
As
these
reflections
passed
through my mind,
I felt a calm
serenity
take
possession
of my
soul
. I looked with an eye of complacency
on Clara and
Rooksby
,
whose
horrors were
depicted
on their pale countenances, I even
wished
them peace of mind and fortitude to meet
the impending danger as they ought. This
world
seemed
fleeting from before my eyes,
and I looked forward with humble hope, to
that which was to come.
Chearily! chearily! my dear
cousin
,
said
Kingly, taking my hand, which hung
motionless
by my
side
, come, come, we
are worth half a dozen dead folks yet.
'Tis a tight little
vessel
my life for it, we
weather the
storm
, and this will be a
seasoning
for you. You will not be
easily
frightened
after this.
My dear Mrs.
Rooksby
,
said
Mrs.
Kingly, laying her hand on that of mine,
which her
husband
held, how much
reason
you have, to hate me, and all my
family
.
Hush
,
said
I, (frightened,
least
she
was going to reveal my
secret
) believe me,
I love and
respect
all of your family, whom
I have ever known.
Do not
say
so
, thou much injured
woman
,
look there, (pointing to
Rooksby
)
You cannot
esteem
that wretch, and yet
you are linked to him for life, while the
only man capable of rewarding virtue like
yours: but no matter, 'tis I have done it
all, and I
deserve
to be unhappy.
I was greatly
distressed
to hear her talk
in this manner. But before I could
interrupt
her,
she
thus continued.
We are now, my dear
cousin
, hovering
on the brink of eternity. Which of us, or
whether any may
escape
the horrors of this
awful night, heaven alone can tell; but we
have both children.
Promise
me then my
friend,
should
you
survive
, to be a mother to
my poor babes, while they
shall
require a
mother's tender care: and
should
it be my
fate to
escape
and yours to
perish
; here in
my Maker's
sight
, I
swear
to
consider
your
Clementina as my own child.
She had hardly
spoke
, when a
severe
shock
which the
vessel
received convinced us
we had
struck
on
some
rocks, and
immediately
from the deck
issued
a
confused
noise
of
lost
! gone! all is over!
Rooksby
started
from his
seat
and
clasping
Clara in his arms,
rushed
upon the deck:
Kingly did the
same
by his wife. The love
of life
still
prevailed over the
sense
of
misery
and I followed them as well as I was able,
crawling on my hands and knees up the
steps
.
Kingly met me
just
as I had reached the top
and taking me in his arms carried me to his
wife. Here a new
scene
of horror
discovered
itself
; the day had begun to dawn
just
enough to
shew
us that we were on a reef
of rocks which ran a
considerable
distance
from the
shore
, and that the rage of the
breakers, while the wind continued
so
violent
would prevent any boat from coming to our
assistance
.
See, cried Mrs. Kingly, there is no
hope. I could not
answer
.We
sunk
upon
the deck folded in each others arms, Kingly
knelt
beside
and endeavoured to
support
us,
and thus in
silent
agony, we waited the
expected
shock
when our
vessel
would fall to
pieces.
But it was near two hours before this
event took place. At length unable to
withstand
the repeated
shocks
,
she
parted and I
saw
Rooksby
and Clara plunged into the
waves.
My terrors and grief here became too
great for human nature to
support
and I
lost
all
sense
of my
sufferings
. How long I
remained
insensible
I cannot tell, but on
recovering
my recollection, I found
myself
alone on the wreck,
slightly
fastened
to it by
a
small
cord, that was
passed
round my
waist
and tied to a ring on the remaining part of
the deck.
The terrors which at that moment took
possession
of my mind, are
still
too
fresh
in
my memory to
suffer
me to proceed.
Adieu,
MERIEL.

MERIEL to CELIA.
IN CONTINUATION.
Paris
,
Feb. 2d.
1784.
I continued
in this
situation
but a few
momentswhen I heard a faint voice
call Meriel, I turned my head and
saw
Kingly emerging from the
sea
and holding
by part of the wreckOh, Heavens!
said
I, are you alive then, and is there any
chance of
escaping
?Some little chance,
said
he, coming near me and beginning to
nutie the cord that was round me.
But where is Mrs. Kingly?Safe,
I hope, he replied, I have conveyed
her on board a
coasting
vessel
, which you
may
see
at no great
distance
from us; but
which cannot come nearer on account of the
wind blowing
strong
in
shore
, and the
sea
running
so
high a boat could not live in it.
Come, my dear Meriel, throw off the
most
cumbrous part of your
dress
, the chance of
saving
you is but very
small
; yet,
should
I
be
so
happy, I
shall
esteem
myself
blest
beyond
expression
, and
should
I fail, I
shall
at
least
have the
satisfaction
of dying with
the only woman I ever loved with ardency
and
sincerity
.
No, Kingly,
said
I, if my life can
only be
preserved
at the hazard of your's,
leave me, I
beseech
you, to my fate. I am
a poor forlorn creature of no
consequence
to any one:here let me lay down the
burthen of painful
existence
!Do you
return to your amiable wife. You may
alone
survive
the fury of the waves; but
encumbered
with me, it will be
impossible
.
Go, my kind, my dear friend, be a father
to my child, and
sometimes
think on her
unhappy mother.
Cease
, dear Meriel,
cease
, thus to
wound my heart, and trifle with the
precious
moments in which I may
snatch
you
A 2
from impending death. I once had fondly
hoped to live only to render you happy;
but
since
fate has ordered it
otherwise
, I
will
preserve
your life or
perish
in the
attempt
.
Oh Kingly, I replied, leave me, let
me die while I am innocent. This
generous
conduct awakens all the
softness
of my
soul
, and
should
I live, I
shall
live only to
endure the tortures of
hopeless
love,
rendered
doubly agonizing by the pang of
conscious
guilt.
Dearest
,
best
of women,
said
he, let
me but
preserve
you, and certain I am that
the rectitude of the heart that can harbour
such
fears will ever
preserve
you from the
guilt it dreads.
The wind now
seemed
a little to abate.
I plainly
saw
the
vessel
coming nearer
Now is the time,
said
he,
almost
forcibly
tearing off my upper garments, and
binding a long
shawl
tight round my
waist
,
he
fastened
it to his arm, and catching me
up plunged into the water. I now became
once more
insensible
, nor do I remember the
least
circumstance
that followed, till I awoke,
as it were, from a profound
sleep
, and found
myself
in a bed on board a
small
dirty
vessel
.
I
raised
my head from the pillow and
the
first
object which met my eyes, was
Kingly on the
opposite
side
of the cabin,
apparently
dead.Mrs. Kingly with a pale
haggard countenance hanging over him; and
stretched
on a
mattress
, which was
spread
on the cabin floor, lay Clara and
Rooksby
just
recovering from a
state
of
insensibility
.
Weak as I was I
desired
to be lifted from
the bed and crawling to that on which my
preserver
lay, I began to enquire what means
had been
used
for his recovery. I found
every
proper, every probable method had been
tried without effect; they
also
informed me,
that he was alive, when they took us up, but
immediately on his getting on board,
nature
exhausted
with the exertions he had
made to
save
me, had given way at once,
and he
sunk
lifeless
on the deck. Tortured
almost
to
madness
by this account, I
entreated
them to renew their applicationsnay,
weak and
exhausted
as we were, both Mrs.
Kingly and
myself
joined our endeavours,
while
Rooksby
and Clara drank a little
brandy
and water, and being covered up warm,
fell into a profound
sleep
. For more than
two hours we continued our applications
without the
least
appearance of
success
; at
length I was convinced I felt a faint
palpitation
of the heart. I mentioned my hopes
to his wife, who thought the
same
. This
gave us
fresh
courage, and in
less
than
another
hour we had the
superlative
felicity of
seeing
him open his eyes. The rapturous
expressions
of joy that
burst
from Mrs.
Kingly on this token of returning
animation
are better imagined than
described
, nor
was mine far
short
of what
she
expressed
.
No
sooner
were we
ascertained
of perfect
success
by his gently
pressing
our hands and
faintly articulating, God
bless
you both,
than
bursting
into tears of the
most
exulting
rapture, we
sunk
on our knees, and as
we wept on each others
bosom
, poured
forth our thanks to that benignant Power,
who had crowned our humble exertions
with
success
.
Never Celia! no never! till that moment
did I fully comprehend what real joy was:
the tide of delight that
rushed
upon my heart
when I heard him articulate the words God
bless
you, more than
compensated
for all
the
anguish
I had ever endured. The
vessel
which had taken us up, was bound to Calais,
whither it now bent its
course
; the elements
growing much calmer, and the wind
becoming
more favourable, and we were once more
safe
on Terra Firma by three o'clock the
next day.
I find the place, on which we were
wrecked
is a dangerous reef on the Suffex
coast
,
fortunately, only one life was
lost
and that
was poor
Lester
, as the
vessel
which
preserved
us
seeing
our
distress
came as near as they
possibly
could in hopes of rendering us
some
assistance
;
Rooksby
is an expert
swimmer
and
Clara a woman of intrepid
spirit
.
We
resolved
on
staying
a day or two at
Calais to recruit our
spirits
. Indeed we all
found
ourselves
astonishingly
recovered after
a good nights
rest
, except Mrs. Kingly, who
appeared weak and languid, was unable to
sit
up and in the
course
of the day was
seized
with alarming faintings. Medical
assistance
was called in, but they declared her frame
had received
so
severe
a
shock
that in all
human probability
she
would fall into a rapid
decline; however change of
scene
, chearful
company, and invigorating medicines might
prove great
restoratives
.This was a heavy
stroke
to poor Kingly. We were unable to
stay
any longer than the next day with him
and it was evident that his Margaret would
not be able to travel
so
early. But there was
no alternative; my mother's danger
pressed
us to
pursue
our journey, and accordingly
the next morning we took leave of the
drooping
patient angel, and her afflicted
husband
,
and
set
forward for Aix, flattering
ourselves
that a few days would bring them to join us.
On our arrival at Aix, Clara left us, and
we proceeded to my mother's. Amelia met
us at the door. Is
she
yet alive?
said
I
eagerly
pressing
forward. She is, replied
Amelia, but greatly
distressed
. We heard a
packet was
lost
and feared it was the one in
which you had embarked.Before I could
answer
I found
myself
in Mrs.
Rooksby
's
chamber. The dear woman held out her
hand to me as I entered; but was unable to
speak
.
Rooksby
approached her bed-
side
,
took her other hand, and
pressed
it to his
lips with reverence; but we all remained
silent
,
I was
pleased
to
see
he
still
retained
sensibility
enough to be
shocked
at his
mother's
altered appearance. When
she
was
a little recovered, my dear children,
said
she
,
pressing
our hands, it
diffuses
a
transient
gleam of
pleasure
over my heart to
see
you once more, and to
see
you
safe
and happy;
how have you left my
sweet
Clementina,
was
she
well? does
she
remember her
grandmother
?I
assured
her
she
was in health,
and if any thing could remain on her infant
mind, it
must
be the
sense
of her
grandmother's
kindness
and affection.She
smiled
approbation, then turning to
Rooksby
Clement,
said
she
, you are arrived in
good time to
close
my eyes and to
smooth
my
passage
to the grave, by
passing
an act of
amnesty
with your amiable relation Captain
Onslow
. Come,
promise
me that the
trifling
cause
of your
dispute
shall
be no more
remembered, and that you will rank him
among the
choicest
of your friends. I know
he longs to convince you, that his affection
toward you is unaltered.
Your
wish
, my dear madam, he
replied
,
must
be to me a law. All our former
differences are from this moment forgotten.
'Tis well,
said
she
; then to-morrow
I hope to
see
my dear
Miss
Sidney exchange
the name of virgin for that of wife. I
shall
then have nothing more to
wish
in this world.
Amelia made no affected objections to this
proposal
, and that evening Captain
Onslow
took his tea with us. When the articles
were
signed
, in which he
settles
on my dear
Amelia, five
thousand
pounds, which was
the
bequest
Mrs.
Rooksby
mentioned to have
made in her will; he
also
presented
her with
a very
handsome
watch, a pair of bracelets
sat
with brilliants and a pair of diamond
earings. The next morning
she
accepted
his hand at the altar with that
modest
reserve
,
free from every
prudish
affectation of
bashfulness
, which ever
distinguishes
the
real woman of
sense
.
From that time no material occurrence
took place for three or four days; only that
I
observed
my mother
seemed
more chearful,
and I flattered
myself
that our united
attentions
might contribute to her
restoration
, I
carefully concealed not only from her, but
even from Amelia, the
cause
I had for
sorrow
,
as I knew it would pain their friendly
hearts, without in the
least
relieving the
anguish
of my own; though I knew by the
frequent and long
absences
of
Rooksky
, that
the chief part of his time was devoted to
Clara
.
But why, thought I,
should
I give my dear
Amelia a bad opinion of a
state
, into which
she
had
just
entered, by revealing to her the
art, the duplicity cruelty and perfidy of which
man is capable. Will it not lead her to fear
a future change in the
husband
, who is now
so
fondly attached to her. Was not
Rooksby
once as fond of me, Oh! had he been like
Kingly, hither tended all my reflections on
the
subject
, I was terrified to find
myself
making
these
comparisons
and
strenuously
endeavoured to
chase
from my mind the
only object on which it could dwell with
delight
and grateful
tenderness
.
But
these
ideas were
soon
interrupted by
the
intrusion
of
some
still
more painful. My
dear Mother was one morning
seized
with a
fit of coughing and expired before I could
reach her apartment, though I was called the
instant
the attendants perceived her danger,
though her death was hourly expected by
those
about her, I had vainly
slattered
myself
she
might recover; I therefore felt her
sudden
departure the more
severely
, and as if my
heart was not already overcharged with
affliction
on the
second
day after her
decease
,
Amelia entered my apartment with a letter
open in her hand. There was an air of
melancholy
and
surprise
about her countenance,
which awakened my
curiosity
. My thoughts
instantly
reverted to England and my child.
Is Clementina illcried I, eagerly,
snatching
at the letter.No!
she
replied
,
folding it up and putting it in her
pocket
,
while
she
calmly
seated
herself
beside
me, the letter is not from England.
Are you
sure
of that Amelia,
said
I,
looking at her with a
scrutinizing
eye.
Perfectly
so
, my dear Meriel, but have you no
other friends, in
whose
welfare you are
interested
beside
those
you left in England.
Perhaps it is from Kingly?You are
right,
she
replied, and the contents are
so
much
less
dreadful than your mind
forboded
,
that I think I may commit it to your
perusal
.
Poor Margaret is
worse
, I fear,
said
I, as I took the letter. She made me no
answer
,
and I read it with a
composure
at
which I have
since
been
astonished
. I
send
VOL. IV. B
you a copy, and believe me, Celia, every
line as I retraced it, has been wet with my
tears.
Farewell, my dear girl, methinks you
must
be weary of a
correspondent
who writes
only on melancholy themes.Ah! my
Celia
,
the
miserable
know no luxury equal to
that of dwelling on their
sorrows
, and
weeping
over their
source
. In this you have
ever indulged me, and it is a privilege I
shall
not
easily
forego.Adieu! God
bless
you.

LETTER LIV.
MR. KINGLY to MISS SIDNEY.
[1]
[1]
He did not know of her marriage with Captain
Onslow
.
Calais
,
Jan.
13
th
, 1784.
Miss sidney
is the friend of Meriel
Howard (for I will not call that dear
woman by the name of her unworthy
husband
;)
to her then I may
address
myself
and
pour forth the
sorrows
that lie heavy at my
heart.
Oh, Amelia!
unless
you could for a
moment
place
yourself
in my
situation
, you
can have no idea of my
wretchedness
. My
wife! my friend! my lovely! and beloved!
Margaret is no more. I have taken up my
pen to inform you of her placid, her
heavenly
end:but I feel I am unequal to the
task
.I
must
pause
.My tears will flow.
in
such
a
cause
the
bravest
need not
blush
to
indulge their
sensibility
.
I am more
composed
I have gazed
on the
serene
countenance of my departed
angel, and gathered fortitude from the
remembrance
of her virtues; from that
blessed
assurance
, that the
stroke
which pierces my
heart has
secured
to her felicity which will
never end.
The
disorder
which alarmed us
so
much,
by its appearance, before
Rooksby
left
Calais
,
terminated in an inflammation on the
lungs and a putrid
sore
throat
occasioned
by
the cold the dear creature had taken and
the agitation her
spirits
had undergone. It
made rapid advances. She knew her own
danger, and
seemed
resigned
to quit the
world, only that her heart yearned for her
children: but even when
she
thought of
them, her pious
soul
extracted
consolation
from the reliance
she
placed on a divine
guardian and protector to whom
she
solemnly
recommended them.
Just
before the
last
awful
scene
was
closed
,
she
called me to her bed
side
, Kingly,
said
she
, I am going.Four years of
superlative
felicity is as much as humanity can
expect. I am
resigned
to my fate, and
humbly
thank my bountiful Creator that I have
not lived to know the privation of your
affection
.
That, my dear Frederic, I fear
would have been a trial to which my
fortitude
would have proved unequal. I need
not recommend my children to your care.
I am
satisfied
you will never forget you are
a father.
I
assured
her of my
constant
attention and
undeviating affection to
those
dear pledges
of our love, and begged
she
would not too
much
exhaust
herself
by talking.
I
must
speak
, my love,
said
she
, Alas!
in a few hours that power will be denied
me. I have
something
of importance to
say
.
You have been vilely deceived. Mrs.
Rooksby
ever loved you.She is truth and purity
itself
.
She was proceeding, when a kind of
convulsion
seized
herand
she
recovered only
to
speak
in incoherent
sentences
Be
the unalterable friendShe is worthy
In my cabinet you willShe
endeavoured to
finish
the
sentence
, but in
vainher eyes
closed
her gentle
spirit
sled
forever!
The
anguish
of my heart is better
imagined
than
described
. Though I ever
endeavoured
B 2
to promote the
happiness
of my
Margaret
;
yet, when I reflect that I did
undoubtedly
love another, and that however,
by the
most
grateful attention, I
endeavoured
to veil my feelings from her, yet
she
knew the
situation
of my heart, and knew
the worth of the object. I cannot but fear
it hurt her
sensibility
and preyed upon her
spirits
.
I
shall
immediately return to England to
attend her remains to their
last
dreary
mansion
,
settle
my children,
dismiss
my
servants
and
solicit
immediate employment; for
idleness
will only be the
nurse
of affliction, and
it is my duty to live and endeavour to
recover
my
spirits
that I may attend to the
dear
bequests
of my Margaret, be father!
mother! every dear relation to her children,
and the firm friend ofI need not write
her name. I have
sometimes
thought her
capricious and
inconsistent
, but the words
you have been viley deceived, have
awakened
sentiments
in my
bosom
, which it is
improper
to indulge, tell her, my dear madam
that while I live, I
shall
consider
myself
as
bound to
support
! honour! and protect her!
Alas! what right have I to protect her? is
she
not the wife of another?Yes
she
is,
but that other is a villain, as
such
every man
of honour and
sensibility
has a right to
step
forward in her defence.
She is purity
itself
true but that
purity
cannot excel the pure the friendly
affection
that glows in my
breast
. A
person
who
looks not beyond the
surface
of things, may
think that
these
expressions
are an
insult
, a
sure
mark of
disrespect
, to the memory of
my departed Margaret, but you my dear
madam will
consider
them as they are meant
a proof of my
considence
in her veracity, a
wish
to fulfil her
last
desire
. Meriel is the
wife of
Rooksby
.My
soul
ever abhorred
seduction
of any kind; but to
seduce
a wife!
a mother! horror! infamy!the wealth of
Indus, the joys of
paradise
would not tempt
me to
such
a
measure
. No, Margaret no!
my beloved partner. Meriel may be the
adopted mother of your children, may
implant
in their minds
those
virtues which have
supported
her under all her afflictons, but for
me, I will
seek
employment abroad, and fly
from trials, which might be too powerful
for me.
I have
just
received
Rooksby
's letter
informing
me of the death of his mother, and
your union with Captain
Onslow
. May
heaven
shower
its
choicest
blessings
on you;
may
costancy
love and peace crown your
nuptials, and may you never know the pangs
which at this moment rends the heart of
FREDERIC KINGLY.
LETTER LV.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Paris
,
February
7
th
, 1784.
My
dear Celia may perhaps be
surprized
that we did not attend the remains of
our revered mother to England: but the
obstinacy
of
Rooksby
was not to be
overcome
,
and I was afraid to leave him
lest
by
my
absence
I
should
appear to give a
sanction
to a connection which though I could not
entirely prevent, I was determined as much
as
possible
to interrupt. My friendly Amelia
and her
husband
were returning to England,
and
proposed
seeing
the
last
duties fulfilled
to my beloved parent, while I heavily and
unwillingly attended
Rooksby
to Paris, where
we were
soon
joined by Clara and Belger,
the former of whom has now thrown
aside
all
restraint
, appearing publicly as the
mistress
of
Rooksby
. Her
house
and
establishment
are elegant;
she
gives
splendid
entertainments
,
and though her infamy is well
known,
she
is courted, followed and
caressed
by the
fashionable
world; while I am
left a poor
solitary
creature, in the
midst
of a
busy
multitude, without friend or
comforter
.
The parting with Amelia was like
severing
soul
and body. I felt as if in
losing
her, I
lost
all
support
, for though I am
sensible
,
that you, my dear Celia,
compassionate
all my
sufferings
, yet
secluded
as you
are from the world, you cannot participate
the
sorrows
of which you have no idea. I
remember, once in the moment of exulting
happiness
, I condemned the torpid gloom
of a
monastic
life. Alas! have I not
since
had
sufficient
cause
to
wish
, that torpor, that
insensibility
had been mine. Yet why
should
I repine? why utter
so
ungrateful a
wish
,
since
had I never mingled in the active
scenes
of life though I might have
escaped
the
knowledge of a Clara, Belger, or
Rooksby
, I
should
also
never have known the
transcendent
worth of Amelia Sidney and Frederic
Rainsforth.
Rooksby
proposes
remaining here till June,
I could
almost
wish
time would double the
rapidity
of his motion and
hasten
the hour when
I
shall
again embrace my Clementina.
Heaven
protect my child, and
shield
her from the
afflictions that have
almost
bowed to the
earth her unhappy mother. Oh! my friend,
hard as the
task
would be, I would
sooner
resign
her to him who gave her being, than
see
her live to be a prey to
sorrows
, which,
though
sympathy
may
soften
, nothing but
death can relieve.
Adieu,
MERIEL.
LETTER LVI.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Paris
,
March
19
th
, 1784.
I fear
my dear friend that
Rooksby
is
in the high road to ruin, Clara
sets
no
bounds to her extravagance. She gives
splendid
balls, concerts
composed
of the
first
performers
,
and pretends to countenance all the
literati of the age;
besides
she
is an amateur
in painting, and it is
almost
incredible what
sums
she
squanders
, in
these
pursuits
. My
dear little girl has now been with me three
weeks.
Susan
Mossop
came over with her,
Susan
is a lively girl and immediately
attracted
the notice of Belger. It gave me pain to
see
it, as I was too well acquainted with the
principles of the man to think he meant an
honourable attachment, and in a friendly
manner warned her to beware. Would you
believe it? my attention to her
happiness
was
construed
into
jealousy
, and from that
moment
she
has treated me with contempt
and
insolence
.
I am
just
informed a gentleman
desires
to
speak
with me. It is
something
unusual
for
me to have a
visitor
especially
a male one. It
may be
some
English
acquaintance I
must
leave you my Celia for a
short
time.
Oh heavens! how hard are my trials:
when will the throbbings of my
bosom
cease
!
When I left my pen and
descended
into
the drawing room, the door of which
stood
partly open, I
saw
sitting
with his back
toward
me, a gentleman in deep mourning.
He
arose
as I entered. Conceive my
surprize
.It
was Kingly.
Mr Kingly,
said
I, endeavouring at a
look of
composure
, while my pale
countenance
and tremulous voice betrayed my
emotions
.He
took my hand, led me to a
sopha
and
seating
himself
beside
me endeavoured in
vain to
restrain
the tears that trembled in his
expressive
eyes.
I have obtained an appointment, my
dear
Cousin
said
he recovering
himself
and
in a few months
shall
sail
on a three years
station
to America: but I could not leave
Europe, without taking a
personal
leave of
the
best
of women and recommending to her
care my dear boys, Heaven only knows what
may be the fate of their father. Say,
should
I never return, will you be their mother,
their
counsellor
, their friend?
Surely Kingly,
said
I eagerly, you
cannot doubt my
readiness
to render them
every
service
, within the narrow
compass
of
my power. The
friendship
I bore their
departed
mother,
s
And is there nothing due to the
affection
with which you once honoured their
unhappy father. Ah Meriel! your
laudable
deception is now of no avail: in my
dear Margaret's cabinet I found a letter
written by her own hand and
addressed
to me, in which
she
explains every part
of your conduct, which had before appeared
so
mysterious
. Yes my
constant
, my
adored
Meriel, I am now
satisfied
, that you
must
have thought me the
basest
of mankind, as
I at one time believed you the
most
capricious
of women: but I can
easily
trace the
black
mischief
to the fountain head.
Hester
Mossop
, had frequently made me
advances
,
which it was
impossible
to
mistake
.
s
Need I tell you I
slighted
her. Ah! my
vol. iv. C
beloved Meriel, how amply has her arts
revenged
her
slighted
beauty.
He caught my hands, while I in vain
endeavoured
to
suppress
my tears; but unable
to command my voice
sufficiently
to
answer
him, I continued
silent
and he proceeded.
My own
disappointment
, my own
sufferings
I have learned to bear without
complaining
;
but your's, dear Meriel, torture
me beyond imagination. I
see
you married
to a man, who ungratefully throws from
him a gem, which might add
splendor
to a
diadem. I
see
you unhappy; and feel I
have not the power to alleviate your
sorrows
.
Your friendly anxiety,
said
I does me
honour; and while I
possess
the
esteem
of
my friends I can never think
myself
totally
unhappy. But you
mistake
, in thinking
Mr.
Rooksby
Pardon me Meriel, I know you would
endeavour to draw a veil over his vices; but
they are too glaring. All the world
must
see
how you are injured!Would to
Heaven,
Rooksby
was not your
husband
,
or that there was any way to oblige him to
do you
justice
without iujuring your fame,
which I would die to
preserve
unspotted
.
Ah, Kingly!
said
I, your life is too
precious to be lightly thrown away.
Consider
your childrenfor their
sake
, for the
sake
of your friends,
preserve
it.
And may I rank Mrs.
Rooksby
among
those
friends, who are
interested
in my
safety
?
Do you doubt it Kingly? who is there
on earth
so
dear?I
paused
I
recollected
I was a wifeI was a mother!
The glow of
self
-reproach,
crimsoned
my
face. He
sunk
on his knees before me.
Oh!
most
adored of womankind! am
I
still
dear to thy heart?Speak!
finish
the
blessed
sentence
!
say
you
still
love me!
and I will live in the
sweet
hope that
some
happy moment may arrive, when every
barrier
will be removed!He
pressed
my
hands to his
bosom
: my head
sunk
upon
his
shoulder
and my tears flowed without
restraint
. Oh, my Celia! let the prude,
the rigidly virtuous blame me: the affection
of my heart at that moment triumphed! I
looked back to the time when to love him
was no crime! the felicity I might, have
enjoyed in his
society
arose
to my view! I
felt, that
spite
of all
resistance
, I
still
loved
him, and was
still
ardently belovedbut at
the
same
moment, I remembered I could
never be his.
Believe me,
said
I, my heart has
never wandered.
Ten
thousand
thanks! cried he,
wildly
kissing
my hands. At that moment the
door opened and
Rooksby
entered. To
describe
the
scene
that
ensued
would be
impossible
.
I felt I had been to blameI dared
not
assert
my innocence, though I had
forgotten
myself
but for a moment.
Detested
villian,
said
he, darting a fierce look
at Kingly; and you prevaricating wretch,
where now is your
boasted
virtue?He at
the
same
time
seized
me rudely by the arm:
Kingly
interposeds
Dare not to treat your
wife
injuriously
she
is an angel.
An angel of
darkness
, I believe,
said
he,
contemptuously
, but I
shall
expect to
settle
this matter in another place.
Rooksby
,
said
Kingly, with an air of
dignity, you are the
husband
of Meriel
Howard. I believe you do not doubt my
courage: but worlds
should
not tempt me
to lift my hand
against
your life.
Base
subterfuge
cowardly villain!
cried the enraged
Rooksby
, and
struck
him.
I
saw
no more.
Sense
forsook
me and when
I recovered, I found they had left the
house
together. I am dreadfully agitated: Six
hours have I
past
in the
most
agonizing
suspence
;
during which time, I have at
intervals
endeavoured to
compose
my perturbed
spirits
by writing:But, alas! I can no
longer proceed.
Interested
in the fate of
both,
should
they fight, I am
destined
to
be unhappy.
Rooksby
is returnedKingly is
dangerously
wounded, and in a few hours my
husband
sets
off for Italy. I return to England
with my child; but
Susan
Mossop
forsakes
me in my
distress
and goes to Clara, where
ruin and infamy, I fear, will
soon
overtake
her. I
shall
write no more on this
side
the
channel. Heaven grant that Kingly may
recover, and
Rooksby
awaken to a
sense
of
his errors. Then may the pale
messenger
of
peace beckon me from this vale of
sorrow
to
that
blessed
mansion
, where the tear
shall
cease
to
slow
, and the heart be
eased
of its
anguish
.

LETTER LVII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Glamorganshire
,
August
27
th
, 1784.
The
hasty
scrawl
I wrote on my
first
arrival in England,
[2]
[2]
Does not appear.
informed you of
my
safety
; but there are many other things
you no doubt
wish
to know, as you
must
have been
surprized
at my long
silence
. A
variety of incidents have contributed to make
me appear neglectful of my friend; but they
are now all
past
, and I am
settled
in a little
neat retreat far from the
busy
scenes
of life,
where my chief occupation is the care of my
sweet
girl. I think my Celia, after buffeting
as I have done the wayes of
adversity
, the
calm
serenity
of my little dwelling
diffuses
a
degree of comfort over my heart, to which
it has long been a
stranger
.
On my arrival in England, I went
immediately
to our
house
in Harley-Street, where
I
spent
a week in the
most
torturing
suspence
expecting every day to hear of Kingly's
death, as I had
desired
a gentleman in Paris
to inform me of that event immediately, if
it
should
happen, or in
case
of his recovery,
to let me know when he was out of danger.
My dear Amelia came to me the day after
my arrival and every tender attention, which
friendship
could
bestow
, I experienced from
her and Captain
Onslow
. At length the long
expected letter arrived and I read, to my
surprize
and joy, that Kingly was in a fair
way of recovery. This was an infinite
relief
to my mind, and I began to regain
some
degree of
composure
, which was only
interrupted
by the idea of parting with my friend
Mrs.
Onslow
, who was on the point of
accompanying
her
husband
to India; but the
privation of her
society
was an event I was
prepared to expect from the day of her
marriage; I lamented it in
silence
, and only
congratulated the dear woman on the
felicitous
prospects
that
seemed
to await her,
without damping her
spirits
by a mention of
my
sorrows
of which her departure from
England was not the
least
.
She had not been gone above a month,
when I was alarmed and terrified by an
execution coming into the
house
, and on
enquiring into my
husband
's affairs, learned
that his folly and Clara's profligacy had
involved
him in irretrievable
embarrassments
;
that he had mortgaged or
sold
almost
all his
property and could not command a
thousand
pounds clear in the world, except the
estates
which had been
settled
on me at my marriage
and the
small
one in
Glamorganshire
, which
he had
presented
to me previous to our union.
I
consulted
with Mr. le Sage, a particular
friend of
Rooksby
's whether any thing could
be done to relieve him, and offered to cancel
my marriage
settlement
; but of this he would
not hear. However I determined to retrench
every
superfluous
expense
in my
house-keeping
,
to
discharge
my
servants
and lay down
my carriage. Having made this
resolution
,
I
instantly
set
about the execution of it,
called
in all my accounts and paid to the
utmost
of my power every thing due, I then told
Mr. le Sage that I
should
leave London and
did not
wish
my place of
residence
to be
known to many of my acquaintance; but
that I
should
esteem
it a favour if he would
inform me, whenever he heard of
Rooksby
,
and forward to me any letters that might
come from the continent. I then with only
two
servants
set
forward for
Glamorganshire
.
I found the journey very fatiguing
especially
when I drew near its
conclusion
. My income
was now very confined yet I thought two
hundred a year would be a
sufficient
support
for
myself
and child with economy, and
would be a certain refuge for her, whenever
I
should
be no more. As to my marriage
settlement
I did not
consider
it as my own,
but held it merely with a view of being
serviceable
to my
husband
in any future
emergency
.
Do not think, my dear Celia, I
mean to
insinuate
that affection for
Rooksby
led me to act thus. No, that had long been
extinct, gratitude had at one time awakened
in my
bosom
an affection pure and tender,
if not ardent, but his conduct
since
has
entirely
extinguished
it, and whatever I do
now proceeds from a motive of duty, and
a
consciousness
of right. He is the father
of my child. He is the man I have
solemnly
promised
to prefer to all his
sex
. Oh!
Celia! what an awful
state
is marriage and
yet how
thoughtlessly
do many
rush
into it.
How ought we to reflect before we take a
promise
it may not be in our power to keep.
While I live I hope my actions will ever be
the
result
of principle, and that principle
rectitude. Let me perform my duty
chearfully
,
and leave the event to heaven. But I
am wandering. When I drew near the
house
which
stands
on my little farm, I was
shocked
to
see
how very
desolate
it appeared, it
had been untenanted two years and only a
young man and his mother lived in one
part of it; the one looked after the farm;
and the other milked the cows, made the
butter and
sent
it to market. Part of the
garden was cultivated but the
largest
half
was over-run with weeds.
Rooksby
had not
seen
it for
seven
years
past
, and in that time
it had been
sadly
neglected,
so
that though
its original value had been two hundred
pounds per year, it did not now produce
half that
sum
. A cold
chillness
sezied
my
spirits
as we drove up to the gate; the
woman
had been taught to expect me for I wrote
to the young man, that a couple of bed-rooms
might be prepared and well aired; the coach
stopped
, the door was opened and from the
house
comejudge who, my dear Celia.
Why no other than my dear old
nurse
,
Deborah
Ellis. I do really believe, I
screamed
with joy when I
saw
her. She, poor old
soul
,
had no remembrance of me; but
stood
curtsying
,
and fearing my
ladyship
was very
much fatigued. I followed her into the
house
a
small
parlour wore the appearance
of comfort; a table was covered with a clean
coarse
cloth, and in a few moments
Deborah
brought in a couple of boiled chickens,
a bottle of current wine, and every other
appurtenance for dinner. I could not now
withhold from
discovering
myself
: but
stopping
her as
she
was about to leave the room,
Deborah,
said
I, have you forgot me
Deborah. A
silent
look of enquiry and
surprize
was her only reply. Surely,
said
I, you
must
remember your poor little
Meriel.Meriel madam! what my dear
Miss
Meriel Howard?Yes Deborah,
your own Meriel, pray
speak
to me, I am
Meriel Howard.She laid her hand on my
arm and looking
earnestly
in my face the
large drops of joy
chased
each other down
her aged countenance.
I think you are like her,
said
she
, but
you are altered, you did not
used
to be
so
thin nor
so
pale. Then
clasping
me in her
arms
she
continued, I know you now, for
well I remember you was the child of
affliction
.
I then told her in as
concise
a manner as
possible
every occurrence that had
passed
since
my removal to London,
still
carefully
concealing
every thing that might lead to the
subject
of my leaving
so
abruptly Woodbine
cott, and the unhappy
consequences
that
preceded
it. But I can plainly
discover
she
too
well
guesses
the
cause
of that elopement.
She comforted and
consoled
me under my
present
circumstances
, and declared
she
would never again be
seperated
from me. I
learnt from her, that the mother of the young
man who managed the farm, was her
sister
,
that
she
was lately dead, and that
she
herself
had come by her nephew's
desire
to get
the rooms ready for his lady's coming; but
she
had, no thought of finding in that lady
the dear little girl, whom
she
had
nursed
,
and loved like a child of her own.
You will readily imagine, my dear Celia,
that the
presence
of Deborah greatly
contributed
to my comfort. I
soon
got
settled
,
discharged
my man
servant
, whom I had
only
engaged to accompany me on my journey,
and with Deborah and Lucy, a young woman
whom I had engaged to wait on
myself
and
attend Clementina, I entered on an entire
new way of life; and believe me, when I
say
, it is by far the
most
comfortable I have
experienced for many years. Colin,
Deborah's
nephew,
superintends
the farm, which
I flatter
myself
, will
soon
be in a
flourishing
state
. My old
fashioned
casements
are
overun with
jesmine
and honey-
suckle
, and
before my door, are a variety of
roses
, pinks,
sweet
-williams, and other flowers, which,
though common are not
less
sweet
, than the
rare and
expensive
exotics that
flourish
in
the green-
houses
of the
first
noblemen in
England. My parlour and dining room are
ormamented with pots of myrtle, geranium,
mignionet, and balm of giliad; the furniture
consisting
only of plain oak tables and neat
matted chairs. My bed chamber and that
of my child, is
furnished
with white dimity,
but made as plain as
possible
. Before I left
London, I went to
see
Kingly's two
children
.
They are in perfect health, and
placed
where I think they will meet with
every
tenderness
and attention. I engaged the
lady under
whose
care they are placed, to
write frequently and inform me of their
welfare; for
should
illness
attack them, I
should
not
hesitate
a moment to fly to their
assistance
.
The world might perhaps, blame
me, yet
surely
, my Celia, the world
must
be more unfeeling than I have even yet
found it,
should
the conduct of a woman
incur its
censure
, who having a child of
her own, loves and
compassionates
those
who
are deprived of a mother's
tenderness
.
In this retreat then, my friend, I hope to
pass
some
few years in tranquillity. Even
if
Rooksby
returns to England, he will be
accompanied by Clara and I
should
be only
thought a
troublesome
intruder; therefore,
unless
he requires it, I will not leave my
retirement
.
Could I be of any
service
to ward
off any impending misfortune, or comfort
him under affliction;
should
a declining
state
of health require the kind attention of a
nurse
, then will I fly on the wings of duty,
and prove
myself
a wife and friend. But
alas! I fear he may perhaps even quit the
world without my either
seeing
him or
knowing
VOL. IV. D
where he is; for he has not wrote to
me
since
we parted at Paris, and knowing
as I do his impetuous temper, I am
sensible
,
especially
connected as he is with
such
a
woman
as Clara, he may be drawn into
dangerous
quarrels. But I grow tedious on
this
subject
, which is ever
uppermost
in my
thoughts, and cruel as he has behaved to
me, I daily offer up a prayer for his
safety
.
Nay,
sometimes
I fear,
least
I have not loved
him as I ought. Perhaps love
so
ardent as
his, was quick
sighted
and could
discover
the difference between
passion
and
friendship
:
yet, from the
first
of our
acquaintance
,
I never attempted to deceive him or
feign a
tenderness
I could not feel. Clara,
I am certain has been the chief and only
cause
of alienating his affection from me.
I remember when I
first
knew her as Mrs.
Moreton at
Kensington
, I told her in the
unsuspected
openness
of my heart every
circumstance
of my my life, my
sincere
attachment to
Rainsforth, my misfortunes, my
rash
and
imprudent
step
to relieve my mother.
These
,
perhaps, with aggravated
circumstances
have
been repeated to
Rooksby
, and he has
imputed
my union with him to
interested
motives.
Nay, he might even think the reluctance I
shewed
to it at
first
was the effect of art.
These
reflections often lead me to think
more favourably of his conduct than perhaps
others will
say
it
deserves
. While I ever
behaved
to him in one uniform manner,
tender
,
attentive, but calm and
serene
. Clara
has no doubt affected the
most
impetuous
passion
and by this means has gained that
ascendency
over him which I greatly fear
will end but in his total ruin or death.
August
29
th
.
I have
just
received a letter from Kingly.
He is going on a three years
station
to
America
.
May the God of Battles defend him.
He had heard of
Rooksby
's misfortunes and
sent
me a letter of credit on his banker; but
of this no
necessity
whatever,
should
tempt
me to avail
myself
. No, Celia, I feel my
heart too much
oppressed
already with the
weight of obligation. I am already but too
apt to make
comparisons
of what is, and
what might have been my fate, and this
shall
be the
last
time I will indulge
myself
in writing of him to you. Speak of him,
I cannot, as no
person
here knows him;
and I will endeavour not to think of him, for
when I remember that there is
such
a man,
I
must
also
remember that it was he
first
taught my heart affection, it was he who
saved
my life
almost
at the
expense
of his
own, and that
possessed
as he is of every
amiable quality, he is unhappy.Oh!
human nature, how weak thou art!
Poor
unstable
beings that we are,
conscious
of our errors, we
suffer
reason
to take the
reins for a moment, and renounce them!
But,
scarce
has the renunciation
past
our
lips, perhaps in the very
instant
of
self
applause
,
some
trifling
circumstance
will
awaken
the feelings of our hearts, and we,
imperceptibly
,
return to
those
very follies, the
remembrance of which, had covered us
with
confusion
!
Adieu!dear Celiaremember me in
your pious
oraisons
, and continue to let me
hear from you. I
shall
write, but my
letter
will contain only the
insipid
detail of
what
passes
at my
solitaty
habitation, or
the, perhaps, not
less
insipid
encomiums a
fond mother will
bestow
in enumerating the
growing perfections of a darling child.
Oh! may that child live to be my
comforter
.
I will hide her from the world, and all
its allurements: So, may
she
never! never!
feel its excruciating pains!I will make my
will, Celia, and leave this idol of my
soul
to your care, in
case
it
should
please
Heaven
to deprive her of her mother. You, I
know, will teach her that in the
bosom
of
retirement,
she
alone can find peace. Oh!
how
blest
the heart
whose
sensibility
has
never been awakened, who, though dead
to all the joys of love or
friendship
, feels
not the pang of
disappointment
, or the
piercing
sting
of ingratitude!Once more,
Adieu!May Heaven ever
bless
you.
MERIEL.
Between this letter and the next there are
several
omitted, which Mrs.
Rooksby
wrote to her friend
during her
residence
in the country, where
she
continued
four years, unnoticed by her
husband
and
forgotten by a world, where her virtues had never
been
esteemed
as they
deserved
. As
these
letters
contain
nothing material it was not judged
necessary
to
print them. Mr.
Rooksby
's return to England
called
her again into the
busy
scenes
of life, and as her
distressing
situations
are
most
feelingly
described
by
her own pathetic penwe here again take up the
correspondence
.
D 2
LETTER LVIII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
Dec.
13
th
, 1788.
Have
you never heard, my dear Celia,
that mariners, who are
accustomed
to
the
vicissitudes
of the
unstable
element, never
experience a long
succession
of calm
serene
weather, but they hold
themselves
prepared
for a heavy
storm
. The
sea
is deceitful and
the inexperienced
sailor
may be
lost
e'r he is
aware of danger. This has been my
case
.
Lulled into
security
by the calm I had been
allowed to enjoy I fondly flattered
myself
that
I
should
sink
quietly into oblivion, forgetting
and forgotten by the world. The accounts
I heard of my
husband
were vague and
improbable
.
I was at a
lost
to think how he
subsisted
. I was told he had
sunk
into the
detested
character of a
sharper
and gambler.
He never wrote to me, never enquired for
me; nay, I was once informed that he had
spread
a report of my death. A few days
after my
last
to you as I was
instructing
my
little darling in the
first
rudiment of the
English
language, a letter was brought me which
I
enclose
for your
perusal
.
MR. LE SAGE to MRS. ROOKSBY.
MADAM,
IT is with infinite regret I take up my
pen to inform you of what I am
sensible
will
give you the
most
lively affliction and
disturb
that tranquillity, which through the
exertions of your own good
sense
you have
for
some
time enjoyed.
Mr.
Rooksby
is in England. He arrived
at my
house
last
night, extremely ill both
in body and mind; he informed me in a few
almost
incoherent words, that he had killed
a man at
Brussels
, where he has
resided
for
some
time, that in the fray he met with a
slight
wound in his
shoulder
, which had
never
been properly
dressed
, as his
servant
had
hurried him to England with the
utmost
rapidity
,
and that he
himself
was unwilling to
stop
after
crossing
the channel till he arrived
in London.
I found he was very much fatigued, and
from the agitation of his
spirits
and
anguish
of the wound, very
feverish
. We
persuaded
him to go to bed and
sent
for a
surgeon
, who examined the wound and
pronounced it
slight
; but in a bad way from
being neglected. He was very
restless
all
night, and towards morning I thought rather
wild in his
discourse
, I
asked
him if I
should
send
for you,
send
for who
said
he,
raising
himself
hastily
, for Mrs.
Rooksby
?
for which of them,
said
he, wildly I have
two wives.I thought this was a certain
indication of delirium and forbore to
answer
him, but he caught hold of my hand
and obliging me to
sit
down thus continued,
if you mean Meriel, I have injured her too
much to expect
she
will come, and as to
Harriet, or ClaraOh! do not tell Clara
where I am!He then appeared
violently
agitated and
soon
after raved in a very
incoherent manner. I thought, madam, it
was
necessary
you
should
be informed of his
unhappy
situation
, and therefore
send
an
express
off with this immediately,
requesting
you will
set
off for town as quick as
possible
;
your
presence
may in
some
measure
calm his
perturbed
spirits
, and be the means of a
recovery
,
which I believe the
Physician
considers
at
present
very doubtful. Fearing
you might not be accommodated with
cash
for
so
long a journey, I have taken the liberty
of
inclosing
a fifty pound note, which you
can repay at your own convenience.
I am Madam,
with great
respect
,
your humble
servant
,
EDWARD LE SAGE.
Welbeck Street
,
Sept.
9
th
, 1788.
MERIEL, IN CONTINUATION.
YOU will readily believe, that when the
shock
my
spirits
had received was a little
subsided
, I
sat
about
hasty
preparations for
my journey: I took Lucy with me and
left Clementina in the care of Deborah.
I made but
short
stoppages
on the road,
taking
but little
refreshment
, and no
rest
till
I arrived in town. Anxiety kept me up,
nor was I
sensible
of the fatigue I had
undergone
:But
when I alighted in
Welbeck
Street, and attempted to walk up
stairs
, I found the exertion was beyond
my
strength
, and I
sunk
almost
insensible
on the landing place. Mr. Le Sage was
very attentive and friendly, as was
also
his
amiable daughter; and by their
kindness
I
soon
found
myself
able to enquire after
poor
Rooksby
. They told me he was
better
,
that he knew I was expected, and, that
he was impatient to
see
me. I rellied my
spirits
, and having at the
request
of my
kind
host
taken a
glass
of wine, I
proceeded
to the
sick
chamber. I approached the
bed
cautiously
.Good Heavens!what
havoc has intemperance and
sickness
made
in his
person
? How little
should
I have
known him for the blooming elegant
Clement
Rooksby
, whom only
seven
years before
I had accepted as my
husband
. Pale,
emaciated
,
and haggard was his countenance;
his words
so
weak they could not be
understood
.
He fixed his eyes for an
instant
on
me; his lips moved, he
stretched
one hand
out toward me and with the other covered
his face. I took the offered hand;
compassion
overpowered
resentment
; I
raised
it
to my lips and wet it with my tears.
Oh! thou dear generous woman,
said
he faintly, I have not
deserved
this
tenderness
I
am a wretch, unworthy of your
notice: but you are an angel of mercy come
to
whisper
pardon to my
soul
that I may
die in peace.
You will live many years yet,
said
I,
many years in comfort and health.
Never,
said
he, eagerly, I do not
wish
to live. Health may return: but my
heart will never know peace nor joy again;
therefore. 'twere well, if it were cold and
motionless
. But, oh! my belovedI do
not
deserve
to live and I am afraid to die!
Here the
nurse
interposed
, and I was
forced to leave him; for while I
stayed
, he
persisted
in talking to me, which irritated
the
disorder
. I had not left him long, when
he
sent
to know if I had brought
Clementina
with me; and
seemed
greatly
disappointed
when he found I had not. His anxiety
to
see
the child,
pleased
me, and tempted
me to write to Deborah to come with her to
town immediately. The tender
assiduity
,
which inclination prompted me to
show
my
poor
Rooksby
, accelerated his recovery and
in about
six
weeks I had the
pleasure
of
seeing
him able to bear a removal to a
small
house
we had taken at Pimlico. I had
carefully
avoided
suffering
him to dwell on
past
disagreeable
circumstances
and endeavoured
by every means I could
devise
, to direct the
melancholy I
saw
daily
increasing
; but my
attempts were vain, and indeed had I known
the real
source
of that melancholy, my own
heart would have been equally
oppressed
.
We had been in our new habitation, but
a fortnight, when one morning as we were
at
breakfast
; two men entered and
arrested
Rooksby
for a debt of five
thousand
pounds.
which he told me was a gaming debt, and
the
same
which had involved him in the
unlucky
quarrel at
Brussels
as he
suspected
the
person
who won it of him, did not win
it fairly. I cannot tell you what I felt. Weak
and low as he was, it was death to
see
him
conveyed to a
prison
, yet that I knew
must
be the inevitable
consequence
of the
arrest
,
as I had no means to extricate him from that
and
several
others of a
similar
nature, for
which he had been draw in to give his note.
With a heart
almost
breaking I
saw
him
depart
,
and then immediately
sent
for a lawyer,
whom I determined to
invest
with power to
sell
the little property we
possessed
, I did not
consult
Mr. Le Sage. I knew his cold
Philosophy
would
strongly
oppose
my giving up
my
settlements
. Yet
sure
, my dear Celia,
I
should
have been wrong to
hesitate
a
moment
,
or out of a pretended care for the
future welfare of my child to
suffer
her
father
oppressed
with
sickness
and tortured
by
remorse
,
forsaken
by
those
gay triflers,
who once called
themselves
his friends, to
waste
the remainder of his wretched life in
a
prison
.
When I had given every proper
direction
for the
raising
what money we could,
and endeavouring to bring the
unjust
holders
of his notes to
some
composition
, I
visited
him in his
sad
abode and endeavoured to
chear and comfort him. That duty
fulfilled
,
I returned to my
solitary
home and taking
my dear girl on my lap gave a free vent to
tears which flowed from real
anguish
of
heart.
Deborah brought in my tea. She
shut
the windows,
stirred
the fire and twice
attempted
to
speak
; but the
honest
creature's
own feelings were too acute to permit her
to comfort me.
My poor Clementina, from
sympathy
had
laid her dear head on my
bosom
and mixed
her tears with mine Mamma is
sick
,
Deborah
,
said
she
. Deborah took her
silently
from me, wiped off the tears that trickled
down her innocent face; once more
attempted
to
speak
, but unable to articulate turned
hastily
from me and wept aloud. How long
vol. iv. E
this
scene
of mute
sorrow
would have
continued
I know not; but we were
aroused
from it by a coach
stopping
and a loud rap
at the door. I trembled, I knew not why;
I
wished
not to
see
any
visitors
, yet had not
presence
of mind to forbid any one being
admitted, and before I could
compose
my
countenance or wipe away the traces of
sorrow
from my face the door opened and a
most
lovely young woman entered. Her
dress
was
second
mourning, neat in the
extreme
,
and
she
was
visibly
pregnant. Her
looks were
characteristic
of
modesty
and
truth. Her manners at once attractive and
commanding,
such
as
she
appeared to me at
that moment, fancy now
represents
her to
my mind, and I find,
sorrowful
as my heart
is, it has yet a vulnerable part that feels for
her afflictions.
She
curtsyed
and with a look and voice
humility entreated pardon for the
intrusion
,
she
had hoped to have found Mr.
Rooksby
at home. He will not be at home to-night
madam,
said
I, as I entreated her to be
seated
, but if you will favour me with your
commands I will
serve
you to the
utmost
of
my power.
Pardon me, madam,
said
she
,
commands
are not for the unfortunate, I came
not to command but entreat.To entreat
Mr
Rooksby
will call to his rememberance
an unhappy woman, who deprived of his
frienship
must
be forever
lost
.
If you mean Mrs. Millar, madam,
said
I with
some
surprize
. I am
astonished
she
could employ
so
respectable
a
person
on
so
very improper a
message
.
Alas! madam I do not know Mrs.
Millar, I have indeed heard of her and that
she
had
used
Mr.
Rooksby
extremely ill,
but it is not for her I would plead, it is for
myself
.
Yourself
, cried I, in
breathless
agitation
.
Does he owe you money.
Oh no! no! he owes me
succour
and
support
, I am his wife! and he has
forsaken
me. I believe the
wildness
of my looks
terrified
her; for
she
caught hold of my hand and
thus proceeded.Dear madam, do not be
angry, you perhaps are his
sister
, you blame
the unequal alliance. I was poor, madam;
but indeed, I will never
disgrace
the name he
has honoured me with.
She might have proceeded longer without
interruption. A
sudden
stupefaction
seemed
to deprive me of
sense
or feeling. This
agravation
of my calamities was more than I could
bear, and nature
sunk
under the
shock
. She
was alarmed and
hastily
rung the bell. The
entrance of Deborah and the child awakened
me to
sensibility
, and the tears which the
dreadful
discovery
I had
just
made had
suspended
,
now
gushed
forth
afresh
. I gave
them free vent, and thanked heaven for the
relief they gave my heart. When I became
a little
composed
, I reflected on the
sad
intelligence
I had to communicate to my
unfortunate
guest
. At one moment I
resolved
in
compassion
to her
situation
to hide the
truth from her; yet on reflection that
appeared
impossible
. My next care was how
to break it to her in the
tenderest
manner;
I invited her to partake my
repast
, and
soothed
her by the
kindest
attention; yet by
degrees
hinted to her that all was not as it
should
be, that I feared her expectations would be
greatly
disappointed
, that
Rooksby
was in
trouble, and I would
advise
her at that time
not to attempt to
see
him.
But if he is in affliction, madam, is it
not my duty to fly to him, though he has
forsaken
me.I fear, my dear, you
would meet a
shock
,
should
you attempt to
see
him. He at
present
could not with
propriety
receive you.Could not,
perhaps
you think he would not?I do
not mean
so
. I never heard him mention
you; but I know there are very forcible
reasons
against
his receiving you;
reasons
which make it altogether
impossible
for you
to be with him.Yet do not be alarmed
though Mr.
Rooksby
cannot I will be your
friend.
It
seemed
as at one moment
she
had
comprehended
the extent of her misfortune, for
starting
hastily
from her
seat
she
cried Oh!
I
see
it all, you, you madam, are not his
sister
,
you are his wife, and I am undone forever!
To give a proper force to the
scene
during
the
rest
of the evening would be
impossible
.
I detained her with me and in the language
of the
purest
simplicity
,
she
told a tale that
for a moment
stole
me from my own
sorrow
,
to lament hers. I have
requested
her to
commit it to writing that I might
transmit
it to you. She has complied and bid me
tell you if
she
can
save
enough from the
wreck of her little fortune to pay her entrance
she
will come and in your convent bury her
shame
and her misfortunes. Oh! my Celia,
should
she
come, receive her with the
kindness
of a
sister
, and
strive
to alleviate the
sorrows
of her heart. She is innocent,
unsuspecting
,
and full of
sensibility
. Comfort
L 2
her then, and think in
so
doing you are
chearing
the heart of your
MERIEL.
P. S. I will continue my melancholy tale
the next packet. At
present
neither my
strength
or
spirits
are equal to the
task
of
writing more;
besides
my adored
Clementina
is far from well, and I have
also
with me
Clara's two boys who, neglected at the
school
where they were left, had been very ill
treated
.I
have but little for
myself
, but while
that little
lasts
, the grand-children of my
revered
Mrs.
Rooksby
, the relations of the
sainted
Margaret Kingly,
shall
share
with my
own child the
morsel
kind heaven
bestows
.
LETTER LIX.
MERIEL to CELIA.
December
29
th
, 1788.
I resume
my melancholy narrative,
though God knows my heart bleeds at
every vein, and the only
consolation
I have
left, is, that you will pityyou will pray for
memy childmy belovedmy only
comfort
:but
Heaven's will be done.
Array'd in robes of white,
In yonder fields of light
She dwells in
presence
of the eternal king
Plac'd on a throne divine;
Round which
resplendent
orbs of fire
Forever glowfor ever
shine
!
Hark! hark!methinks I hear her
sing
,
And with a rapt, a grateful
soul
, admire
The
verlasting
joys that round her
spring
.
She was
sweet
as the
roses
that bloom,
And perfume the breath of the May,
But, alas! to my
sorrow
as
soon
,
She faded and withered away.
Bring me lilies that grow in the vale,
And
springs
from the
jessamine
spray
,
They are
sweet
tho' they're
sickly
and pale
She was fairer and
sweeter
than they.
Her
soul
like the lily was pure,
Like the
Jessamine
fair to the eye,
Was her formbut, alas! when I tho't her
secure
,
'Twas decreed
she
should
sicken
and die!
And now in the coldcoldgrave
she
lies
No more
she
glads my heart, or chears my eyes.
But I'll
rise
with the morn!
To
visit
the turf
That o'er the
blest
seraph
is
spread
;
Whilst
I pluck from the earth
Nettle,
thistle
or thorn!
That unknowing her worth
May,
spring
o'er her innocent head.
For in her
breast
, no
boist
'rous
passion
dwelt
She never envy knew; or malice felt.
But pure as angelsfrom this world
she
fled
To yonder realms!
so
exquisitely
fair
She
sleeps
the cherub
sleeps
she
is not dead!
She will awake to joys eternal there.
And that we may all awake there, is my
earnest
prayer. Poor Clementina!I laid
her by the
side
of my dear mother. Oh,
Celia! the one was not more innocent,
more worthy a place in the
mansions
of the
blest
, than was the other:I am poor!
Celia
very
poor!there is no monument:
no, not even a
stone
, to tell where their
beloved
ashes
repose
but
sacred
be the
dust
that covers them! They who knew
their worth, will revere the
spot
where they
rest
and none who love their memories,
as I do, will
pass
it without a tear!
I took up my pen to write: I know not
whyfor I have nothing to
say
only that
this is a
sad
very
sad
world to live in.
For if we love any thing we are
sure
to
lose
it.
God forgive me, I often complain, when I
have no right to do
so
for we were all
born to
suffer
.Oh! my dear Celia,
I
wish
you more patience than I have: for
I am very impatient
sadly
impatient:
but then indeed I am veryvery
wretched!
LETTER LX.
FREDERIC KINGLY, ESQ. to COL. ONSLOW.
London
,
Jan.
20
th
, 1789.
I arrived
in England, dear
Onslow
,
just
in time to
administer
relief to the
most
amiable,
most
lovely of her
sex
. When
I went to
visit
my dear boys, I enquired
when they had
seen
Mrs.
Rooksby
. They
told me that for
some
time
past
they had
neither
seen
or heard from her. I then
repaired
to Le Sage, who I knew was
Rooksby's
banker. From him I learned that
Rooksby
was in
prison
, and the dear
worthy
Meriel in
distress
for even the common
necessaries
of life. Her child, her beloved
Clementina had been ill with the
measles
,
and was even then in the
utmost
danger
from a
disorder
which had
settled
on her
lungs. I
hastened
to
seek
her out, and
found her,
Onslow
, in a
small
lodging up
three pair of
stairs
, in the vicinity of the
King's bench
prison
, where her unworthy
husband
was confined. When I entered the
room,
she
was kneeling by the bed-
side
, her
face, her hands, elevated towards that
Heaven
whose
mercy
she
supplicated
in behalf
of her dying child.
Beside
her knelt two
lovely
interesting
boys, whom I afterwards
learned were the children
Rooksby
had by
Clara. I
spoke
to her. She took but little
notice of me, for the feelings of a mother
had
absorbed
every other. She
signed
for
me to
sit
down, and pointing to her
daughter
looked unutterable
anguish
. I enquired
whether
she
had proper advice and
assistance
;
her
answer
cut me to the heart. She
had not the means to procure proper
medical
advice!Every thing of value
had been
disposed
of to
support
her
husband
.I
did not remain long with this
dear
suffering
angel!But
sent
a
Physician
and a
nurse
to her, telling the
latter
,
I would defray every expencefor
will you believe it,
Onslow
, the dear
creature
,
though reduced to the
utmost
distress
,
had never availed
herself
of the letter of
credit
I
sent
her previous to my departure from
England. On the third day after this
arrangement
,
I called to enquire how
she
was
and found her
sweet
little girl had
just
breathed her
last
. That was not a time to
offer
consolation
. I took the two boys
from her, and gave orders for the funeral.
She had a very decent woman with her,
whom
she
called Deborah, and who I
saw
was both
respectful
and affectionate in her
behaviour. I thought my company at that
time might be more
intrusive
than welcome;
besides
I was
sensible
the world was ever ready
to
censure
an unhappy woman, who in
distress
met with
friendship
, however
disinterested
from our
sex
. I therefore determined
to wait till the funeral was over, before I
attempted to
see
my dear afflicted Meriel;
but on the very evening that the child was
buried, I received a
message
from Deborah,
saying
her
mistress
was extremely ill, and
she
wished
I would come to her
immediately
.
I had been told that my adored girl
had once before from the effect of a very
heavy affliction,
lost
her
senses
for
some
days(though what that affliction was, I
never learned.)But from this intelligence,
I was prepared to find the
same
misfortune
had befallen her. I was not deceived. She
was writing when I entered the room, to a
Miss
Shelburne, with whom
she
spent
the
early part of her life in a convent at
Bologne
,
such
a letter,
Onslow
, as would melt
the
most
obdurate heart. I waited till
she
voluntarily
resigned
her pen, which
she
soon
did, when folding her letter and
speaking
to me, as though I was her
servant
she
hade me make
haste
with it to the
Post
or I
should
be too late. It was by
stratagem
I got her to accompany me home, where I
provided medical and other
assistance
.
Deborah
has faithfully attended her, and I am
told
she
is now in a fair way of recovery,
though her
senses
are
still
wandering.
During her confinement I have taken care
that
Rooksby
should
want for nothing;
because
I believe it is the
first
wish
of the dear
creature's heart. But I cannot bring
myself
to
see
or
converse
with a man, who has
reduced
so
noble a mind as Meriel Howard's
to
insanity
; for
sure
I am, her mental
faculties
must
have been greatly weakened by
prior afflictions or
she
would not
so
powerfully
have felt the
loss
of her child. Her
pious
soul
, if in the unimpaired
use
of her
reason
, would have
severely
felt the privation
but
still
submitted
with patience.
Deborah
sends
for me. May it be good
tidings from her, who is all in all to me,
and who though the wife of another,
possesses
my
tenderest
affection. Blame me not, my
right was prior to his, and believe me my
affection is pure as the
soul
of her who
inspires
it.
She is
restored
to
reason
, thanks be to
heaven for it, I have not yet
seen
her, nor
does
she
know in
whose
house
she
is; but I
VOL. IV. F
am all joy at the fair
prospect
of her
returning
health. Tell your lovely amiable wife
that every exertion
necessary
for the
restoration
of her friend
shall
be
used
, and that I
hope my next letter will inform you of her
perfect recovery. God
bless
you. May I
see
my dear Meriel in health before I am
ordered
again to leave England and I
shall
go
without regret. Adieu,
Yours in
friendship
,
F. KINGLY.
LETTER LXI.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
March
16
th
, 1789.
Once
more
snatched
from death, or what
is to a thinking mind far
worse
, a total
deprivation of
reason
; I have next to an
almighty
providence, to render thanks and
bless
the hand of Kingly. Why am I doomed
to be thus obliged, where I have no power
to return the obligation but by grateful
prayers and tears; I have
some
faint
recollection
of having wrote you a letter after the
death of my beloved Clementina; but I fear
it was very incoherent and hardly intelligible;
but I will now endeavour to go back to the
period when the poor young creature whom
my
husband
had
so
vilely deceived came to
my
house
at Pimlico. I
resolved
to prevent
her, if
possible
, from
seeing
Rooksby
, as I
knew it would only irritate his
sufferings
,
without in the
least
alleviating her own; I
therefore prevailed on her to remain with
me till I could form
some
plan that might
be of
use
to her; and as I every day expected
Kingly in England, I thought he might
render
himself
of
service
to her, without
subjecting
her to the
unjust
censures
, which
would be
cast
on me
should
I accept favours
from his hands.
My time
passed
wretched enough for three
weeks. At the end of that time I perceived
that Harriet, which was the name of my
Proteg
appeared
somewhat
more chearful
and on enquiring the
cause
,
she
informed me
that
she
was certain
she
had
seen
her mother's
brother
pass
our
house
frequently, that
she
had inquired his name and learned it was the
same
she
had thought it to be, that he lived in
the neighbourhood and was a wealthy
widower
without children. From this information
Harriet had conceived the idea of writing
to him and faithfully explaining her unhappy
circumstances
. She
shewed
me the copy of
a letter
she
had prepared, which as it
contained
the chief events of her life, I
requested
leave to
send
to you. I
inclose
it, and as it is
necessary
you
should
read it before I proceed
I
shall
here break off.
LETTER LXII.
[INCLOSED IN THE FOREGOING.]
HARRIET VENABLES TO GEORGE PREVOTT, ESQ.
December
24
th
, 1788.
Perhaps
, my dear and honoured uncle
will be both
surprized
and offended to
receive a letter from one whom no doubt he
has heard, conducted
herself
in a manner
that has thrown an odium on her family, I
have been to blame, greatly to blame, but
not
so
very culpable as you and perhaps all
the world imagine.
I am fully
sensible
of the many
disadvantages
I labour under, while
addressing
you,
yet when I remember that out of a numerous
family you were the only one, who
shewed
a
friendship
for my poor mother when her
union with my father
so
highly offended all.
When I recollect the many
instances
of your
affection I have
myself
witnessed
when I was
but a child, I cannot but hope you will not
turn away from the daughter of that once
loved
sister
.Oh! why was I
so
early
deprived
F 2
of her maternal affection, or why
did not the
same
stroke
that
snatched
her
from the world take
also
her unhappy
daughter
;
for
surely
of all the forlorn beings
the world contains a girl deprived of her
mother is the
most
pitiable. She may, it is
true, meet with relations or friends that will
in
some
measure
supply
her place, but alas!
they will not have the watchful care, the
fond
solicitude
of a mother. Had I never
lost
that dear parent I
should
not have been the
unfortunate
creature I am; for there is a fort of
talismanic
virtue in the very name of
mother
,
that while it fills our hearts with
sensations
undescribably
delightful, is tempered with
such
awe,
such
fear of giving pain or
incurring
displeasure
, that it
must
be a very
insensible
daughter who would wilfully do either.
My dear father was the
tenderest
, the
fondest
of parents, and
strained
, to the
utmost
,
his little income, to procure for me
an education
besitting
a gentlewoman. He
placed me as a boarder in a convent near
Abbeville, his place of
residence
, that he
might keep a watchful eye upon my
conduct
;
for the honour of his family and that
of my mother's were ever dear to his heart,
and he often
said
that he would
sooner
see
me in my coffin,
whilst
a child, than have
me live to fully the name I bore and the
family I
sprung
from. My life
passed
in
uninterrupted tranquillity, 'till I was
seventeen
,
at which period a
Mademoiselle
St.
Farr was going to leave the convent and
marry. She had ever conceived a great
esteem
for me, was five years older than
myself
and had
resided
in the convent from the
death of her father, which happened when
she
was very young. She was a woman of
an enlightened
understanding
, lovely in her
person
and elegant in her manners. She
ever
preserved
that dignity, which
renders
our
sex
respectable
, yet mixed it with
such
charming vivacity,
such
sprightly
wit
and unaffected good humour that
she
at once
commanded
respect
and conciliated
affection
.
I have been thus minute in my
description
of
Mademoiselle
St. Farr, that you
might not be
surprised
at my father's
ready
compliance with a
request
she
made, that
I
should
accompany her to
Brussels
, and
remain with her during the winter
season
.
Young and volatile my heart bounded at
the
prospect
of the liberty and
pleasure
I
hoped to enjoy under her protection. Her
husband
Monsieur
Melville was a gallant
man, and from the day of their marriage,
promoted every entertainment that he
imagined
could give
pleasure
to a young
beautiful
woman,
just
emerged from the gloom
of a convent. But Madame Melville was a
woman of too much
discernment
to
suffer
dissipation
and folly to have a moments
ascendency
over her mind. After
sharing
in
the
amusements
of
Brussels
a few weeks,
she
expressed
a
wish
of living in a more
domestic
manner, and retired to an elegant
chatheaux
,
which her
husband
possessed
on the
banks of the Seine. Thither I
accompanied
her: but, alas!
sir
, my weak mind had
been
fascinated
with the
pleasures
of the gay
world, and I had
lost
all
taste
for retirement,
and rational
society
. The account in
some
measure
for this change I
must
candidly
inform
you, that during my
stay
at
Brussels
I
had formed an acquaintance with an
English
gentleman of the name of
Rooksby
.
He was a man of fortune, lived in an
expensive
stile
, and (I
blush
while I own it,)
at that very time lived publicly with a
woman
of an abandoned character.
But, he had paid me
numberless
attentions
and a
profusion
of compliments,
so
fascinating
to the inxeperienced female heart,
that I fancied, (fatal
mistake
!) had he an
affectionate wife, whom he loved;
she
might
reclaim him from the follies of which he
seemed
so
fond. He had often
professed
a
passion
for me, but not openly, and there my
errors commenced; for at his
request
I
forbore
to mention his
pretensions
to
Monsieur
or Madame Melville. That lady
soon
discovered
the alteration in my
spirits
, after
my leaving
Brussels
, and inquired into the
cause
. I evaded her kind
questions
: and
soon
after her brother coming to their
chatheaux
on a
visit
brought
Rooksby
with him.
My chagrin
vanished
; I was again chearful
and happy. A change
so
visible
could not
escape
Madame Melville's penetration;
she
imagined it might be the attractions of her
brother (who was in every
respect
her
counterpart
)
which had made an
impression
on
my heart. With a
smile
she
entreated my
confidence; but by the
unembarrassed
air
with which I
answered
her interrogations
she
discovered
her error. The
smile
was
changed
to a look of
apprehension
. I hope
Harriet,
said
she
, you have not
listened
to
any flighty tales from that young
Englishman
.
I do not like his character. My
brother brought him here from a motive of
friendship
to endeavour to detach him from
a
set
of gamblers, who in combination with
a very vile woman, are leading him
blindfold
to ruin. He is a very weak young
man, and
possesses
no
stability
.
After this
conversation
she
kept a very
strict
eye upon me, and
soon
discovered
enough to make her think it
necessary
to
send
me back to the convent
sooner
than
she
at
first
intended.
Rooksby
followed meI
had not attempted to conceal from him the
sentiments
he had
inspired
me with. We
found means to
correspond
: he laid a plan
for my
escape
from the convent, I followed
his pernicious councils, and we were
privately
married; but under a
strict
injunction
never to divulge our marriage till he
should
give me leave. Imagining that
obedience
to him was now become my
first
duty
,
I took a
most
solemn
oath, never to
reveal
our union, though by
so
doing, I could
avert the
heaviest
misfortune. Gracious
Heaven! how little did I
suspect
the
dreadful
calamity, which then hovered over my
head? Happy as I was, in having, as I then
thought,
secured
him to
myself
, I
still
felt
a
considerable
alloy from the reflection that
I had acted undutifully to my dear father;
that I planted a dagger in his heart,
perhaps
incurred his
heaviest
malediction, yet
dared not
sue
to him for pardon. Another
source
of
disquiet
was, that whenever Mr.
Rooksby
was
absent
for any length of time,
I
suspected
he was with Clara the woman he
had
so
publicly kept. To divert the
melancholy
,
these
fears
occasioned
, he
proposed
going for a few weeks to Paris, and
thither
I accompanied him. I had been there
but ten days when one night, as I was at
the opera,
dressed
in the
gayest
stile
and in
company with a woman to whom he had
introduced me.
Just
as the performance
began, I
saw
Madame Melville enter a box
opposite
to me, led by a gentleman
whose
face was from me. Judge, my dear
sir
, if
possible
, my emotions, when he turned
round to
seat
himself
, I
discovered
my
father
.
His pale dejected countenance
struck
me with horror, an involuntary
shriek
escaped
me, he
raised
his eyes, he
saw
!he
know me!Great God!
said
he,
clasping
his hands, and
sunk
from the
seat
in a
state
of
insensibility
. What my feelings
were at that moment, I will not, I cannot
pretend to
describe
; nor can I tell how I
got round from the box where I
sat
to the
one that contained my father. All was
confusion
;
but the
distraction
of my brain
prevented
my attending to any thing, but my
parent, whom I
saw
before me to all
appearance
dead!And, alas! bitter reflection,
murdered by my ingratitude and
disobedience
!
When he began to recover, madame
Melville
hurried him out of the
house
, and I
followed them
almost
unknowingly into the
carriage. My father
suffered
me to hold
his hands in mine, but did not
speak
to me
during the time we were going to Madame
Melville
house
. When we alighted, I
percieved
he trembled
so
he could
scarcely
stand
. I followed him into a parlour, where
he
sunk
upon a
sopha
. I fell on my knees
before him. Forgive me, father, dear father,
forgive me.
Harriet,
said
he, what am I to think
from your appearance.tell me, tell me
instantly
and without prevarication.Are
you married?
Do not
ask
me, I cannot
answer
.
Enough,
said
he, I
understand
my
dishonour
.Oh!
my father, will you not
pronounce my pardon?
Yes,
said
he feebly, may heaven
eternally
bless
you and forgive you as I do
now. When I heard of your departure
from the Convent it was like a bolt of ice
shot
through my heart. Oh! child, I have
not had a moments peace
since
; but, if my
pardon can give you comfort, from my
soul
I pardon youBut you are
dishonoured
.
Oh! my child, how have you forgot what
was due
He was proceeding; but his voice
faultered
and his head
sunk
on my
shoulder
,
I thought it was a return of his
faintness
,
and
shrieked
for help. Alas! how
shall
I
proceed. The horrors of that moment will
never be blotted from my memory. We
raised
and laid him on the
sopha
, we
strove
to revive him; but in vain. His noble
soul
had never known
dishonour
, and the
springs
of life before
exhausted
by
sickness
and many
afflictions gave way at once under the
pressure
of a calamity he was not prepared to bear.
Oh!
sir
, when I reflect on that night, when
I remembered it was my folly, viper that I
was, that
stung
him to the heart, my brain
turns round, and only that he forgave me,
with his parting breath, the very idea would
deprive me of
reason
.
Madame Melville
suffered
me to remain
at her
house
till the
last
duties ware paid to
his beloved remains; but as my character
was now become equivocal,
she
forbore ever
after to
shew
me any countenance. I
sincerely
lamented the privation of her
friendship
,
and the more as I found it was an
example
that was followed by every woman of
character with whom
she
was acquainted.
My
situation
on that account became
extremely
painful, and I mentioned to Mr.
Rooksby
, my
desire
of returning to
Abbeville
,
to take
possession
of the
small
patrimony
my father had left me. He
acquiesced
,
and we
set
forward immediately.
vol. iv. G
Three months, three little months,
passed
on in tranquillity, when my
husband
informed
me he had particular
business
which
called
him to
Brussels
, that it would be
impossible
for him to return, and he thought it
most
expedient to
sell
off what furniture, &c.
we
possessed
, and to
settle
at that place.
Alas! my dear
sir
, fond of his
society
, and
having no will but his, I
hesitated
not to
comply.
At
Brussels
, a new
scene
presented
itself
;
a
scene
which gave me a pain,
impossible
to
describe
! and which no one but a wife
who loved as I did can
possibly
conceive.
Mr.
Rooksby
renewed his connection with
a
set
of gamblers and
swindlers
, who live on
the follies of the unwary.He became
their dupe and in a few months was a very
beggar.It was one hot afternoon, in
the middle of
August
last
, when overcome by
the weight of the
atmosphere
, and
oppressed
by my own reflections, I had retired to
an arbour, which terminated the
small
space
of garden belonging to the
house
we
occupied
,
and was endeavouring to divert my
sorrow
, by the
perusal
of an
English
novel,
which had been recommended to my
notice
.
I was deeply
interested
in the
sorrows
of the
Welsh
Heiress
, (who never
having known the
pleasures
of maternal ten
derness
, felt her heart expand towards
those
whose
affection
supplied
the place of a
mother
.)
My mind was occupied, my heart
softened
, the tears
stole
from my eyes, but
they were tears that flowed from a
source
so
pleasing
, I
wished
not to
stop
their
course
:
for while
sympathy
for poor Anna's
distresses
awakened my
sensibility
, I felt the
most
exquisite
delight in the remembrance that
there was an author, a female author
[3]
[3]
Mrs. Bennett, author of
Juvenile
Indiscretions
,
&c.
, who
in conjunction with a Burney and Lee would
snatch
the
British
novel from oblivion,
and future ages
should
with
pleasure
peruse
the productions of her pen. Pardon me,
sir
,
but with
such
fervour do I revere
those
superlatively
happy few, who to a brilliant
cultivated
understanding
, add a fertile natural
genius, an elegant refined
taste
, and great
sensibility
, all other
subjects
are forgotten,
and I am like a rapt
enthusiast
, all wonder
and veneration. But to return to
myself
,
I was employed in the
perusal
of the
Welsh
Heiress
, when
Rooksby
with a hurried
step
and
embarrassed
air entered the arbour: he
sat
down
beside
me,
struck
his hand
against
his forehead, and breathed a
sigh
that
seemed
to come from his heart. My dear uncle
must
have a bad opinion of my heart, if he
thinks fictitious
distress
could longer
engross
my thoughts, and though he had been from
me then above a fortnight, yet as I knew
he was my
husband
I
also
knew it was
my duty to receive him on his return
with a
smile
, and, if
possible
, alleviate the
afflictions which
seemed
to
oppress
him. I
threw
aside
my book and taking his hand
inquired the
cause
of this
visible
dejection.
He told me he was ruined
past
redemption,
that he had even
lost
more than he
possessed
the means to pay.Unexperienced, my
heart overflowing with affection, I
endeavoured
to
sooth
his
sorrows
; and to calm
the immediate perturbation of his mind, I
put into his hands
almost
the whole of my
worldly
possessions
: for I thought the
most
abject poverty preferable to
seeing
him
labour
under
such
dejection of
spirits
. He
left me
soon
after and I,
visionary
like,
amused
myself
with the hope of
seeing
him
return (after he had paid his debts of
honour
)
a true penitent, and that
some
little
might be left from the wreck of his fortune,
on which we might live in decent
competence
retired from the world, and yet enjoy
all the real
blessings
of life.
But, alas!
sir
,
these
pleasing
,
delusive
hopes
lasted
but a
short
time. Night
advanced
,
and
Rooksby
did not return! Day
after day
passed
, and I
saw
him not! I
sent
to inquire after himhe was
still
with his
dissolute
companions!A fortnight
passed
in the horrors of the
most
torturing
suspense
at
the expiration of which, the
following
inchorent
scrawl
was put into my
hand.
HARRIETI am
lost
.I have killed
a manI am wounded
myself
, yet flying
from the hand of
justice
.I am a wretch,
a very wretch! and what is
still
worse
, dear
injured Harriet, I am a villain!!!
Forget mefor you will never
see
me
more.
ROOKSBY.
I know I
deserve
it, yet do not, dear
Harriet, do not,
curse
me.
The
perusal
of this horrid billet threw me
into a
state
of
insensibility
, and when I
recovered
the power of thinking, it was too
late My
husband
was
set
off for England.
I would have followed; but a fever
occasioned
by the agitation of my
spirits
,
consined
me to my bed. Long and doubly
tedious
G 2
were the hours of
sickness
, as they
prevented
my following and even in
prison
attending him. The anxiety of mind
retarded
my recovery, and I
selt
myself
much
hurt and neglected at receiving no tidings
from Mr.
Rooksby
. At one moment, I
thought him dead! at another,
languishing
on a bed of
sickness
. At length, I heard
by accident, that he was recovered from the
consequence
of his wound, and this
intellgence
in
some
measure
relieving my anxiety,
I began to regain my health, and when I was
able
set
forward for England. On my
arrival
in London, I went to a Mr. Le Sage,
whom I had often heard Mr.
Rooksby
mention
was his banker. By him I was
directed
to Pimlico.But, Oh! my dear
sir
I cannot proceed.I am not his wife!
There is another aprior claim to mine!
He has a wifeangelic creature! I am now
under her protection. She has held forth
to me the hand of benevolencethough,
much I fear,
she
has
scarcely
the means to
support
herself
, as
she
told me the other
day that
she
must
leave the
house
she
was
then in, and
discharge
her
servants
, as her
income would afford nothing but the
necessaries
of life; yet added
she
, with a
smile
of friendly attention,
small
as my power
is, you
shall
be welcome to
share
with me
the little I have left.
Oh! my dear uncle, let me intreat you
to extend your
kindness
towards me. All I
request
is means to return to France, and
spend
the remainder of my days as a
pensioner
in a convent, where by a
constant
course
of penitence and prayer I may in
some
measure
atone for my offences.One thing
more. I hardly know how to write it; but
a few months will make me a mother.
Should this unfortunate child of affliction
prove a girl; with me
shall
the be buried in
the
shades
of
obscurity
: if a boy to your
care I
must
commit him, for alas! I have no
means to
support
him, and may you, dear
sir
,
teach him to avoid the vices of his father,
and whenever he
sees
a wretched
forsaken
woman, to pity and endeavour to comfort
her, in remembrance of the
sorrows
of his
mother.In hopes of your pardon and
protection, I beg leave to
stile
myself
your
Dutiful Niece.
HARRIET VENABLES.
MERIEL, IN CONTINUATION.
It
was not long after this letter was
dispatched
before Mr. Prevott came and
personally
offered to Harriet an
asylum
in
his
house
. Their meeting was tender I
shared
her joys as far as my own unhappy
situation
would permit, but cordial as was the offered
friendship
of her uncle I could perceive he
felt,
severely
felt, poor Harriet's
dishonour
.
I was greatly relieved by her having found
so
able,
so
proper a protector; for indeed,
my dear Celia, I was reduced very low, and
two days after
she
left me I removed from
the
house
at Pimlico and which we had taken
ready
furnished
. I
discharged
my
servant
and
would have
persuaded
good Deborah to
return
to Wales to her friends, offering to pay
her
expenses
home. But this was attempting
an
impossibility
. She told me I might
send
her from my
presence
; but no power
should
force her from London. She would remain
near me, nay,
she
would
serve
me while
she
had life. Such a proof of
disinterested
sidelity
awakened all my gratitude, and from that
moment I took her for my companion, my
friend, my
adviser
, and we removed together
to a
small
lodging near the King's bench
prison
, where poor
Rooksby
was by this
time removed; for his
distresses
were
so
complicated and his affairs in
such
a
distracted
state
it was
impossible
to procure his
enlargement
.
Here it was I
first
began my
letter to you, in which I meant to have
included
the whole account of my
sad
change,
but my dear girl
sickened
with the
measles
,
and after
languishing
near a month was
taken to eternal
bliss
. I fear, my beloved
Celia, I behaved in a manner unbecoming a
Christian
, I did not
submit
as I ought I gave
way to
despair
and was
punished
by the
loss
of
reason
, for
several
weeks. In this
situation
Kingly once
morestepped
forward to
preserve
and
rescue
me from the horrors of a mad
house
; for to that dreadful
state
, or perhaps
worse
to that of a poor wandering lunatic
destitute
and forlorn, I might have been
reduced
but for his timely
interposition
. He
had me removed to his own lodgings,
attended
by the
best
Physicians
, nay, he even
extended his benevolence to my unfortunate
husband
,
whose
feelings had been
strongly
awakened by the death of his child. But
those
feelings were
soon
overcome, and his
heart again become calous. When I
first
began
to recover my recollection, it was carefully
concealed from me where I was. Deborah
by degrees informed me of all that had
passed
and told me Kingly
requested
to
see
me. I
was too weak in mind and body to
resist
,
and for
some
time I was
accustomed
to
pass
an hour or two with him every day, I
saw
not the danger, the impropriety of my
situation
,
till
roused
from my dream of
security
by
the following
circumstance
.
I was well enough to leave my apartment
for the adjoining room, where I had dined
for the
first
time with Kingly, who, as he
said
, to
surprize
me agreeably had
sent
for
his dear boys from
school
, and
also
Clara's
two children, whom he has taken under his
protection. At the
first
sight
of the children
my
sorrows
all revived and I gave wayto a
violent
burst
of tears, which relieved the
oppression
that
seemed
like a cord to be bound
round my heart. I wept plentifully, nor did
any one attempt to prevent me. The dear
children had all by degrees drawn nearer to
me, and the
youngest
boy climbing on my
lap, wiped off my tears with his frock,
whilst
he
kissed
me and bade me not cry any more.
I know not how it was; but the
anguish
of
my heart gradually
subsided
. I am not
destitute
of comfort
said
I mentally;
these
dear children, the
friendship
of Kingly, is
something
yet! how many at this moment,
a
thousand
times more
deserving
, are more
wretched, more forlorn than I am. During
dinner
these
reflections occupied my mind.
I
spoke
little, but I felt a degree of
serenity
pervade my
breast
, to which it had long
been a
stranger
. When the
desert
was
removed
,
the boys growing rather
boisterous
in their play were
dismissed
to another
apartment
.
Kingly
seated
himself
next me. We
were for
some
moments
silent
.
I hope,
said
Kingly, my dear Mrs.
Rooksby
, you will now
soon
be able to reap
the benefit of
fresh
air, and go for a
short
time into the country. It will be of great
service
to you.
I hope I
shall
, replied I,
soon
be able
to go out; for then I can go to poor
Rooksby
,
for I
wish
to
see
him and learn how he is
accommodated; I fear he has been very
uncomfortable
during my
illness
.Surely
my dear creature,
said
he, fixing his eyes
on my face with a look of
expressive
tenderness
,
surely
you cannot mean to return to
that man.
Why not, Mr. Kingly. He certainly
wants a friend and comforter under his
present
uneasy
circumstances
.
But are not his
present
calamities the
fruit of his own folly; and has he not behaved
in the
basest
manner to you? has he not
forfeited
all right
Not to my duty and attention,
said
I,
eagerly interrupting him, if he has forgot
his duty, it is no rule for me to neglect
mine.
But
should
you leave him, all the world
would acquit you.
Yes Kingly; but I
must
be acquitted by
a higher, a more
sacred
tribunal than the
world. I
seek
the approbation of my own
conscience
, and the continued protection
of a Being;
wise
! as he is great and
merciful
.
But
surely
, my dear Meriel, as you have
done your duty, nothing more can be
expected
from you.
Yes Kingly, yes while I live, and
Rooksby
is in
existence
I know my marriage vow
is in full force; and may I
soon
be able to
fulfill the
sacred
engagements I entered
into.
Oh! Meriel you
surely
love,
spite
of his
errors this ungrateful
Rooksby
.
Nono,
mistake
me not, I mean not
to arrogate to
myself
the merit of a virtue to
which I have no claim. I pity him from my
soul
, nay would
sacrifice
my own peace; to
restore
his tranquillity; but did I love him;
Oh! gracious heaven, did I love him, I could
not live and retain my
reason
under my
present
circumstances
.
Then, why Meriel, why will you
sacrifice
your own peace, to a chimerical notion
of duty? If you love him not, why return to
him: why fly from a man, who not only
loves, but
almost
adores you? Then
stay
with me, thou beloved of my
soul
,
share
my fortune and be the friend of my
bosom
;
Rooksby
shall
enjoy all the comforts, nay
if you require it, all the elegancies of life.
Shall I tell you, my friend,
shall
I
confess
that
strong
as was my
sense
of
rectitude
,
I felt my
resolution
slacken
. My
treacherous heart even debated whether I
should
not
stand
excused
, if I accepted his
offer.Oh, God! pardon the
weakness
of
frail humanity, if for a moment, I forgot
what was due to the Deity I
served
the
religion I
professed
. Yes, Celia, I
listened
,
I thought
myself
convinced, and had
consented
to leave the man to whom I had
promised
love and obedience to the
latest
period
of our lives.
vol. iv. H
Kingly, though ardent in his
wishes
for
me to be
seperated
from my
husband
, was
respectful
in his behaviour and we
passed
the
evening in a friendly
conversation
, which
would not have called a
blush
on the cheek
of a brother and
sister
. Deborah had during
my
illness
always.
slept
in my apartment.
But a few nights preceding the one I have
mentioned, we had prevailed on her to go
to another room and
suffer
one of Kingly's
servants
to occupy her place on a
mattress
by
my bed-
side
.
When I was retired to
rest
, when I no
longer
saw
the
expressive
countenance, or
heard the
persuasive
tongue of Kingly,
reflection
returned with double force, and I
perceived
I was
standing
on the brink of a
precipice
,
from which if I receded not in time,
I
must
plunge into
everlasting
ruin. Weak
as I
still
was from the effects of my
disorder
,
I
resolved
to fly, while I had
sufficient
reason
left to direct me from the dangerous
temptations which
surrounded
me.
Forsaken
,
injured by my
husband
, and under
the immediate protection of the man, who
first
taught my heart to beat with affection,
who had conferred on me obligations I
could never repay, who
still
loved:And,
Oh! my dear Celia, (the glow of
confusion
covers me as I write it,) who
still
was
beloved by me.
To deliberate a moment; was to be
lost
,
another
such
an interview as the
last
, and I
might
rush
on irretrievable
destruction
.
The
servant
who
slept
in the room with
me, wearied by the employments of the day
enjoyed a
sound
and
undisturbed
repose
.
The clock had
struck
three, when convinced
of the danger of remaining longer under his
roof, I
resolved
to fly from Kingly. A
candle
was always burning in my room: I
arose
with as little
noise
as
possible
, wrapping
myself
as warm as I could and tying up a
change of linen in a handkerchief, I glided
softly
down
stairs
, and opening the
street
door ventured into the
street
. I knew
there were coaches employed in the night
as well as the day, and did not fear but I
should
soon
find one to convey me to the
house
where I had lodged, previous to the
death of my ever regretted Clementina, and
where I knew I
should
be received and might
remain till the hour when I could be
admitted
into the
prison
to my
husband
.
You will, perhaps, blame me, for
leaving
the protection of Kingly, in
so
abrupt a
manner. Perhaps you will
say
why not
stay
till the morning, and then inform him of
my
resolution
.Alas! my friend, I dared
not
stay
. I was
sensible
of the
weakness
of
my heart, and had he intreated! had he
looked unhappy! I know it would not have
been in my power to
persevere
.
His lodgings were in
Westminster
near
the park, and I found no
stand
of coaches
near. Add to this, my
weakness
and the
penetrating
keenness
of the night air, made
my head
swim
, and I
staggered
like a
person
intoxicated. I was proceeding as well as I
was able toward
Westminster
bridge, when
a cry of thieves and a watchman's rattle
arrested
my attention. I was then near the
end of Parliament-
street
, and before I had
time for a moments thought found
myself
surrounded
by a number of watchmen,
constables
and other
strange
looking people,
who one and all,
persisted
that I was an
accomplice
with a gang of thieves, who had,
by the
assistance
of the
housekeper
, broke
in and robbed a lady's
house
in
Georgestreet
.
I attempted to
speak
; but had not the
power. A cold
chillness
seized
me, and my
limbs failed, though I
still
retained my
senses
and felt the horrors of my
situation
in
their full force!Imagine, my dear
Celia
,
for a moment what my feelings were.
I feared my
reason
would again wander:
but it
pleased
Heaven to
preserve
me from
that dreadful calamity. They conveyed me
without
resistance
to the watch-
house
, where
they threw me like a
beast
upon the floor,
imagining my inanimation to proceed from
the effects of liquor. Though unable to
speak
, I groaned
pitiously
and felt the tears
gush
in torrents from my eyes: but
still
I was
unnoticed by all, except a young creature
who I am
sure
could not have counted above
sixteen
years, and who habited in a white
bedgown, a tattered
silk
petticoat, and a
pair of old
sattin
shoes
that would
scarcely
save
her feet from the ground,
sat
in a
corner
of the place near where they had thrown
me down; and as I then verily believed,
where I was to end my days. For the
sudden
shock
that had deprived me of the power
of
speech
and motion
seemed
like the
stroke
of death, and I
listed
up my
soul
to that
Power
who I thought was calling me to
himself
from a world, where from a child, I had
experienced
little
else
but
sorrow
.
The poor girl, whom I heard them call
Peggy, knelt down
beside
me
raised
my
head on her knee and put a
small
glass
of
warm punch to my mouth, which the
constable
had
just
given her.Let her alone
H 2
Peggy,
said
he,
she
has had enough already.
She is
so
drunk
she
can neither
speak
nor
stand
.
Poor
soul
, cried Peggy, in an accent
of the
softest
compassion
. She is ill I can
see
she
is, and may die for want of
assistance
.
Come, continued
she
,
swallow
a
drop of this. It may revive you.
Celia, the love of life is
so
strongly
impressed
on human nature, that though
bending
beneath the weight of
almost
insupportable
afflictions we
struggle
still
to
preserve
existence
. I
swallowed
the offered
refreshment
,
Peggy chaffed my hands and laid my
head upon her
bosom
; my
spirits
revived,
my
strength
began to return and in
less
than
half an hour I could articulate my thanks to
my
preserver
. Till ten the
ensuing
morning
I remained in this
miserable
place, nor
was I even able to procure the
least
accommodation
for
myself
or companion in
sorrow
;
for they had not only taken my
bundle
from me but even
risled
my pockets of
a guinea and a half, which was all that I
possessed
in the world. At ten o'clock a
coach was called and with
several
others I
was carried to a
justice
's for examination;
for it was alledged that I was the woman,
who had opened the door to the thieves and
that having got what booty I could
myself
,
I was making off when they
stopped
me; in
evidence of which they produced my little
bundle which contained two
shifts
a
petticoat
two
muslin
handkerchiefs and a linen
gown. The
constable
also
swore
that I had
more property about me; but that I had
thrown it away when they
pursued
me and
they could find nothing but a gold watch
chain which they had picked up, and which
they immediately produced wrapped in a fine
cambrick handkerchief. Judge my
surprize
,
Celia, when on opening the handkerchief I
saw
my own watch chain, to which was
fixed
a miniature of my departed child
set
round
with pearls, and on which I had
desired
Deborah to
raise
some
money, I imagine the
faithful creature had deceived me and
raised
the money on
something
of her ownyet
how the chain could be dropped by me was
a
mystery
,
unless
as I have
since
reason
to
think it was with the gown I had packed up
and might drop from the bundle. During
my examination, a coach
stopped
at the
door and an elderly lady entered. It was
the lady,
whose
house
had been attempted.
The moment
she
saw
me
she
pronounced me
not guilty.
I never
saw
her before,
said
she
, with
visible
emotion, and even had
she
lived in my
house
. I could not have
suspected
her.
I cannot, my dear Celia,
describe
this lady
to you
such
as
she
appeared to me. There
was a mixture of
majesty
and
condescension
in her manner, her countenance beamed
benignity
,
and it appeared a countenance
rendered
grave by affliction rather than that by
nature. Several other
persons
were now
brought in, who had been apprehended by
other watchmen, and from a variety of
evidences
I was acquitted; when I heard
those
words
pass
the
justice
's lips, I was
hastily
leaving the place, but a man
stopped
me and
told me I could not go till I had paid all
fees.Indeed
sir
,
said
I, in a voice
scarcely
audible, I have no money; that
watch chain I think was mine, yet how it
came here I know not nor dare I demand it.
Permit me to go and if ever it is in my
powerI
shall
do no
such
thing,
mistress
,
said
the man, either pay the fees
or
stay
in our
custody
till you can.
I could not
answer
, but
raising
my hands
and eyes to heaven was returning in
silent
agony when the lady advanced and
inquired
the
cause
of my new
distress
.
And are
these
your
British
laws
said
she
, that when a
person
is
falsely
accused
and their innocence made perfectly appear,
are they to be detained from their families
for the paltry
consideration
of a few
shillings
?
She then put her hand in her pocket
and
presented
me with two guineas, at the
same
time
asking
if
she
could be of any further
service
to me; I would have thanked her, but
my feelings were too powerful to permit me
to
speak
,
she
saw
my gratitude,
she
perfectly
comprehended from my looks more than
words would convey.You
interest
me,
said
she
, can you not tell me how I may
serve
you. Oblige me, madam; make me
your friend I will not
abuse
your confidence;
but pardon me, I am to blame. This is no
place for
conversation
. Do me the favour
to wait till I have
finished
the
disagreeable
business
that brought me here, and then
give me leave to take you to any place you
wish
to go to in my carriage.I
curtsyed
my
assent
to this humane
proposal
, for
indeed
Celia, I was unable to walk, and could
but ill afford to procure a coach.
Harrassed
as my
spirits
had been, my
strength
was
exhausted
and I was
almost
sinking
with
faintness
.
When the lady had ended her
business
,
she
desired
me to follow her,
just
as we were
stepping
out of the door, poor Peggy who
was
just
released
,
passed
us on the
steps
.
Forgive me, madam,
said
I, if I
presume
to
share
with this benevolent girl, the
bounty of your hand. She did all in her
power
last
night for me, I fear I
should
have
perished
, but for her humanity.I then
gave her the remainder of the guinea I had
changed to pay the fees of the office. God
bless
you,
said
she
,
pressing
the hand that
offered her the money, while the tears
started
in her fine blue eyes. And was
she
kind to you?
said
the lady. I repeated
the
circumstance
of the preceding night.
Good girl,
said
she
, have you any
friends?
addressing
Peggy.
Oh! no Madam, I am a poor, guilty,
forlorn creature:
lost
to every thing but a
sense
of my own
misery
.
So young, and yet
accuse
yourself
of
guilt. Alas Madam, I was involved in
guilt before I knew the value of virtue.
The lady
answered
not; but giving her a
card, bade her call on her in the afternoon,
and
she
would do
something
for her.
And now,
said
she
, as
she
seated
herself
in her carriage, tell me where you
wish
to go.
To the Kings bench
prison
, madam.
To a
prison
, good heavens! have you
friends there?
My
husband
, madam, is confined there.
Have you any children?
I had, madam, one, a
sweet
girl:
butI could not proceed. I turned
my face from her, and we both remained
silent
for
several
minutes.
I too,
said
the lady,
starting
as it
were from a deep reverie. I too, once had
a childa girlnay, perhaps have
still
; but for many! many! years,
she
has
been
lost
to me.
When we drew near to the end of our little
journey,
she
told me
she
felt inclined to be
my friend, and if I would do her the favour
to call at her
house
and point out the means,
she
would readily exert her
utmost
abilities
to alleviate the afflictions, which
seemed
to
press
so
heavily upon me. She then told me
her name was Harcourt and
wished
me a
good morning.
Weak,
oppressed
, dejected my trembling
limbs being
scarce
able to
support
me, I
slowly
ascended
the
stairs
, which led to the
apartment
occupied by
Rooksby
. The door was
opened. I was
just
entering, but a
sight
met
my eyes that
almost
annihilated me. It was
Rooksby
seated
beside
his infamous Clara,
with tea and coffee on the table before them.
From their own
dishabille
and the appearance
of the room, I perceived they were but
just
risen
. I know not what I
said
in the
first
moment of
surprize
, but I remember
clasping
my forehead hard with both my hands
and exclaiming, grant me patience
heaven
.
As I ran down
stairs
, my brain
seemed
whirling in perpetual motion and
had I not been detained by one of the keepers
of the
prison
I fear I
should
have
rushed
into
the
street
in a
state
little
short
of
insanity
.
The recollection of what I then
suffered
is too much for my weak
spirits
. I cannot
proceed in my narrative. Adieu, my
friendly
Celia, I am now in a place of
safety
and
will, when I am able, inform you of every
occurrence down to the
present
time.
Heaven
bless
you.
MERIEL.
LETTER LXII.
FREDERIC KINGLY, ESQ. to COL. ONSLOW.
March
7
th
, 1789.
I hardly
dare take up my pen to write
to the worthy
Onslow
: for I have
rendered
myself
totally unworty of his
friendship
.
Will you and your amiable Amelia
believe it? No you will think it
impossible
,
that II, who
so
often have
sworn
to
protect
her,
should
act in
so
thoughtless
a
manner
as to drive the lovely Meriel from my
house
. Yes,
Onslow
,
she
left my
house
in
the night, unattended and
rushed
into
dangers
,
of which her delicate mind could form
no idea; and my folly was the
cause
. I
forgot what was due to her honour and my
own, and dared to
solicit
her to quit her
husband
and remain with me. Oh! fool,
madman that I was, when I knew the
dignity
of her mind, to think
she
would
suffer
such
a thought to harbour in her
bosom
for
a moment. She once loved me;yes, and
I
with a voice
soft
as harmony, yet with looks
and manners
chaste
as Diana, has
she
lately
confessed
she
still
does and ever
shall
love
me. But did I not know the heart of Meriel
Howard. Was I not
sensible
, that with all
her
sexes
softness
she
possessed
the
firmness
and intrepidity of a Spartan matron? But
I am tormenting you with
suspense
while I
am writing an eulogium on her, with
whose
virtues you are already well acquainted.
The dear creature had recovered
so
far as
to be able to leave her apartment, when
the
conversation
passed
between us, which
frightened her from the protection I had
vainly hoped would have henceforth
sheltered
her from all the ills of life. She had
supped
with me, and on retiring,
wished
me a good night with a look and voice
so
full of
tenderness
, that I longed to
press
her
to my heart: but I forbore and only
kissed
her hand. Early the next morning, I was
awakened by poor Doborah, who
asked
me
if I knew where her lady wasfor
she
was
not in her apartment, nor had the
servant
who
slept
in her room
seen
her. Terrified,
least
her unfortunate malady
should
have
returned
,
I
hastily
arose
and inquired of
every
person
in the
house
if they had
seen
her;
but to no
purpose
. The
street
door was
found unlock'd and on
searching
her
apartment
her hat and cloak with a few
necessaries
were
missing
. It then
rushed
into
my mind that her own
sensibility
and
strict
sense
of rectitude had driven her from my
protection. Where could
she
go? Her
friends or rather
those
who had once
stiled
themelves
so
, had all
forsaken
her in her
misfortunesto whom then could
she
go?
Distracting
as the thought was, I concluded
she
was gone to her
base
treacherous
husband
.
Impressed
with this idea, I went
immediately
to the
prison
; but
she
had not
been there. I did not attempt to
see
Rooksby
,
I could not have
spoken
to him with
calmness
. I returned home
almost
deprived
of
reason
, nor had I any tidings of the dear
fugitive, till late in the afternoon, when
I received the following note.
MRS. ROOKSBY. to F. KINGLY, ESQ.
You
are no doubt
uneasy
; let this
calm your fears, I am
safe
.
Reason
told me I
must
not remain any longer with
you. I came to my
husband
; but
something
has occurred, which I cannot now explain,
and which makes it
impossible
for me to
remain with him. We have parted, I
believe
,
forever.But I charge you, Kingly,
endeavour not to find me out,I
wish
not
to
see
you again. It is meddling world.
They have been already too
busy
with our
names.Think me not ungrateful for
your
friendship
: it will never be obliterated
from my mind while I have life; but it is
fit, it is proper we
should
meet no more.
I know my faithful Deborah will
wish
to
come to me. Bid her come with the bearer
of this, who waits. But oh! Kingly,
unless
you
wish
to add another weight to my already
insupportable
afflictions, make no attempt to
see
me.Heaven
bless
you, forever
bless
you, I cannot
express
all I
wish
; perhaps
did I feel
less
, I could write with more
eloquence.As my
last
request
I intreat you
not to withdraw your bounty from the
children
of Clara. They are innocent, whatever
are the crimes of their parents. Oh Kingly,
if you could
see
my heart, you would
see
it
bleed with real
anguish
, while I tell you we
must
not cannot meet again. Once more,
God
bless
you, and reward you for your
kindness
to the wretched
MERIEL.
Though I
earnestly
desired
to
see
the
suffering
angel, her commands, her pathetic
entreaties to me were
sacred
; I
sent
for
Deborah and giving her ten guineas bade
her
hasten
to her
mistress
and to let me know
when
she
wanted more
cash
. The faithful old
woman
sobbed
with joy when I told her that
her lady was
safe
; and left the room
almost
with the alacrity of a girl, when
she
was told
to follow the
messenger
who brought the
letter.
The next morning, the money was
returned
in a
small
parcel, which I received and
opened without knowing from whence it
came. On the inner paper were
these
words.
Dear generous Kingly, I am already
overwhelmed
with obligations from you. Pardon
me, I can receive no more. There was no
name annexed; but I knew the dear characters
had been traced by the hand of Meriel.
Resolved
, if
possible
,
still
to
serve
her, even
against
her inclination, I went to my agent
and
desired
him to go to the bench, make
inquiry for Deborah and pretend to pay
some
money that was owing to old Mr. Howard.
But here I failed; for when my agent
returned
,
he informed me that Mrs.
Rooksby
had been with her
husband
that
she
remained
only a
short
time and where
she
was gone
no one could tell. He
also
informed me
I 2
that
Rooksby
had a woman in the apartment
with him, who had been thrown into
prison
about three weeks before by a Mercer, to
whom
she
was indebted upwards of a hundred
pounds, and that both of them expected
soon
to be
released
. From his
description
of the
woman's
person
, I
should
suppose
it to be the
infamous Clara; but think it
almost
impossible
,
as I was informed
she
was living at
Brussels
only a
short
time
since
in great
splendor
with a man of the
first
rank and
fortune
.
Should it prove
so
, I
shall
pronounce
him a blacker villain than I ever thought
him: and how like an angel will the villainy
of the one and the ingratitude of the other
make Meriel appear, who in the very
moment
that
she
was
so
cruelly treated by them
could recommend their children to my care.
I will obey her,
Onslow
. They
shall
share
the education of my own boys, and I make
no doubt of being able to provide for them
either in the army or navy.
Every inquiry after Meriel is vain. She
has hid
herself
so
effectually as to elude the
strictest
search
; I can no longer
stay
in
England
I have
solicited
employment in the
West
Indies and
shall
soon
sail
. I have
commissioned
my agent to continue his
search
for Mrs.
Rooksby
and
should
he
discover
the place of
her retreat to
supply
her with
cash
, without
suffering
her even to
suspect
from whom it
comes. I am certain wherever
she
is,
she
is
in
necessity
. Good heavens, that I
should
live to
say
, while I am in
possession
of all the
superfluities
of life, Meriel Howard, the
first
choice of my heart, the woman I love and
revere above all her
sex
, is perhaps
languishing
for want of the means to
support
existence
.
I will write no more I am
almost
devoid of
reason
when I think for a moment
on the
subject
.
I hardly dare
desire
my remembrance to
your Amelia. I know how
she
loved and
esteemed
Meriel, and I have
some
faint
hope that
she
will hear from the dear
sufferer's
own hand how
she
has
disposed
of
herself
;
for certain I am, that while life warms
the heart of Meriel Howard, it will glow
with grateful affection for Amelia Sidney.
And while I live, I
shall
remain your's in
friendship
.
F. KINGLY.
LETTER LXIII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
May
20
th
, 1789.
I broke
off abruptly in my
last
, for
I found my
spirits
were unequal to the
task
of retracing
scenes
which had given me
so
much
uneasiness
. I informed you of
my
discovery
of Clara in the
prison
with
Rooksby
; but I am yet to inform you that
when, by the humanity of one of the
keepers
,
I was prevailed on to go into a room
and endeavour to
compose
myself
, I
received
a verbal
message
from my cruel tyrant,
desiring
me to leave him to his fate and
return
to my favourite Kingly, with whom he
knew I had publicly lived for
several
weeks in
defiance of
shame
. A
message
so
injurious,
so
unjust
,
roused
my
resentment
, and I
demanded
to
see
the cruel man, who could
thus dare to
insult
me.
I once more
ascended
the
stairs
to his
apartment
,
and knocking at the door, entered
with as much
resolution
, as I could
assume
.
He received me with a mixture of
confusion
and contempt, and Clara, without
deigning to
rise
from her
seat
; gave a
slight
inclination of the head: but at that
moment
I felt
myself
a wife, an innocent
injured
wife! and
resentment
conquered every
other feeling!
Rooksby
!
said
I,
seating
myself
opposite
to him, and regarding him with a
fixed attention, I come to inquire by
what action of my life, I have incurred the
unjust
censures
you have thrown upon me,
or in what I have forfeited my claim to
your regard,
since
I have been your wife.
By your vile connection with Belger,
before you were my wifeand your
still
more infamous intrigue with Kingly
since
!
said
he, in a kind of hurried accent, as
though
conscious
he did not
himself
believe
what he
asserted
.
By all my hopes of future felicity,
Rooksby
,
I replied, I am innocent of what
you
accuse
me, as was the infant I bore
and who, I
trust
, is now an angel in the
mansions
of the
blest
!At the recollection
of my child, tears, in
spite
of my efforts to
suppress
them,
burst
from my eyes.
Rooksby
was affected.
Poor Clementina,
said
he,
rising
and
coming toward me, I
should
have liked to
have
seen
her once more, before
she
was
gone forever.
Clara,
saw
she
was
losing
ground;
so
rising
in great
haste
,
she
told him that when he had
settled
the difference that had been between
us, perhaps,
she
might look in and
congratulate
us; that content was a great
blessing
,
and a forgiving temper, a
sure
sign
of a
good
christian
; that for her part,
she
had
good
reason
to
suppose
both Mrs. Belger and
Mrs. Kingly fell victims to my art, for their
hearts were broken by their
husbands
,
whose
affections I had exerted
myself
to obtain,
and had effectually drawn from them.
If,
said
I with more
firmness
than I
believed
myself
capable of, if every
woman
in the world was as free from the crime
of
seducing
the affection of a
husband
from
his wife as I am, it would be well for many.
But, be not
mistaken
, Clara, I come not
to
sue
to my
husband
, or endeavour to
regain
his heart, I am at length convinced I
never
possessed
it, and as it would have been
happy for us, had we never met; I am
determined
that we will here part forever!!!
Forever, Meriel,
said
Rooksby
, leave
me forever?
Clara's countenance brightened, and
she
resumed
her
seat
.
I am well convinced,
Rooksby
, I
replied
,
that
so
far from having it in my
power to
serve
or oblige you, my
presence
is painful to you, and I am
considered
a
burthen.The pain, the burthen
shall
therefore be removed.
And you will return to Kingly?
No!
Rooksby
.Here in the awful
face of Heaven, I
swear
, I never have, nor
ever will
dishonour
the name of your
revered
mother: a name, which at her
request
I
received from you. And, that Heaven is
my
witness
, was the chearful
discharge
of
my duty a
source
of
happiness
to you, as no
power on earth
should
seperate
me from
you!I would remain with you in the
most
abject
distress
comfort you
nay, even labour for your
support
! but
as it iswe
must
part!!!I forgive
you from my
soul
, every injurynot
only
you! but,
those
who have been the
cause
of your errors!I will pray for your
happiness
and forget, if
possible
how
cruelly and how often you have wronged
me!
I am villain!
said
he,
rising
and
striking
his forehead with vehemence.
Before we part
Rooksby
, cried I,
laying
my hand on his arm, I
solemnly
conjure
you as the
last
and only
request
I
shall
ever make,
seek
not to palliate your own
faults by taxing me with guilt. I am
conscious
of my own innocence, and feel not
the
sharpness
of the
accusation
; but it
increases
your own offences in the
sight
of
Heaven!I forgive every thing that has
past
only, throw not an odium on my
character, and I will
bless
you forever!
You are, you
must
be innocent,
said
he, I believe you are pure as an angel.
You are a
treasure
too great for me to
possess
.
I have voluntarily thrown you from me, and
though I know your worth,
some
strange
fatality ever
pursues
me, and the
weakness
of my nature hurries me to actions which I
know are wrong.
Farewel!
said
I, turning to leave the
room.
But whither are you going, Meriel, I
fear you are in want. My affairs begin to
wear a better
aspect
. I have had a few
thousands
left me by a relation. Let me know
where to
send
to you that you may
share
in
my fortune, though I can never hope again
to
possess
a place in your heart.His voice
faultered and he actually
shed
tears. Celia,
Rooksby
is a man
so
weak
so
unstable
in his
nature that the
impulse
of the moment ever
hurries him away: and perhaps
just
then he
would have
sued
for a reconciliation and had
he been
master
of the world offered to divide
it with me. And the
first
moment Clara
had an opportunity to exert her art,
she
would have revived all his
suspicions
and I
should
again been ill treated, vilified, nay,
perhaps
thrust
like an abandoned wretch
from his
house
.
Sensible
of this
versatility
of temper I
wished
not to prolong our interview,
besides
I was
faint and
exhausted
. The
spirits
which
resentment
had
roused
were now begining to
subside
and when I
considered
his errors and the
weakness
of his nature I only
considered
him
as an object of
compassion
. The
presence
of Clara too was
insupportably
painful, I,
vol. iv. K
therefore,
almost
forcibly tore
myself
from
him and hurring down
stairs
immediately
left the
prison
, and went to the lodgings I
had occupied before.
The woman of the
house
received me
kindly. After I had taken
some
refreshment
I lay down and endeavoured to procure a
little
rest
; but the effort was ineffectual.
The
scenes
I had been engaged in the
preceding
night and day entirely occupied my
thoughts; the idea of Kingly's
surprize
and
uneasiness
when he
should
discover
my
having
left him; the
sorrow
of my affectionate
Deborah, my own forlorn
situation
, and
dreary future
prospect
, all
conspired
to
banish
from my eyes the balmy comfort of
sleep
.
I
arose
, and procuring pens and paper, wrote
a few lines to my
husband
informing him
where I was, that he might not
say
I had
prevented his
assisting
me by not letting
him know where to
send
. I
also
wrote to
Kingly in a manner which I knew would
effectually prevent his endeavouring to
see
me; but
desired
him to
send
Deborah back
with the
person
, who brought the letter.
I
passed
the night in a very
restless
manner
,
and in the morning was unable to
rise
.
A fever, want of appetite, and great
lassitude
,
hung upon me for above ten days.
Indeed, I thought I was going into a rapid
dicline; but the care of Deborah, who
nursed
me with
incessant
tenderness
, and
parted
even with
some
of her apparel to
procure
me proper and
nourishing
food,
restored
me to
some
degree of my wonted
strength
.
During this time, I heard nothing from
Rooksby
: though perfectly
satisfied
, that
his
sickle
disposition
had operated as
usual
,
and that no longer
seen
, I was no longer
remembered, yet
something
prompted me
to
send
to the bench and inquire after him.
Deborah was my
messenger
;
she
returned
and told me he had been
released
above a
week. I then
sent
to Le Sage; but without
letting him
suspect
who made the inquiry,
and learned that my
husband
, (Oh, Heavens!
happy had I been, had he never borne that
title!) had left England in company with
Clara; for I particularly
desired
the
person
who inquired, to
ask
, wherever he was, if
he was alone.
It was now time to think of
some
means
of
support
, Gratitude
also
required that I
should
call on the benevolent Mrs. Harcourt.
I
dressed
myself
as neat as the
scanty
state
of my wardrobe would allow and repaired
to her
house
. At my approach, I
saw
the
shutters
of the upper part were
closed
; my
heart
sunk
; but yet I ventured to knock
at the door. A woman
servant
opened it.
I inquired for Mrs. Harcourt. She is at
Bath, replied the woman. Has
she
been ill then?Yes,
she
caught cold on
the night her
house
was robbed, which
added
to the fright, brought on the gout in
her
stomach
. She was taken ill the next
evening and for
several
days was thought in
great danger; but
she
is now better, and
yesterday
morning
set
off for Bath.
I thanked the woman for her information
and was going from the door, when who
should
I
see
cross
the hall but Peggy. She
saw
and
instantly
recollected me: an exclamation
of joy and
surprize
escaped
her and
she
ran
to the door to
speak
to me. She informed me
that Mrs. Harcourt had taken her into the
house
as an
assistant
to the
housekeeper
that
the kind lady had mentioned me previous to
her departure, and
desired
if I called I
would leave word where I might be
found. I told Peggy I was not
settled
in any
place at
present
; but I would call again in
the
course
of a fortnight when I hoped to
hear of Mrs Harcourt's perfect recovery.
On my return, I
consulted
with Deborah,
what we could
possibly
do to earn a
subsistence
.
The affectionate creature could think
of nothing. She could only weep that I was
obliged to have
recourse
to work. After
revolving
many various
schemes
in my mind,
I at length fixed on one, that I thought was
seasible
It was to
send
Deborah to the
woman, who had formerly
supplied
me with
millinery, and to
desire
her to inquire in my
name whether
she
could give employment
to a reputable young woman, who was in an
ill
state
of health and only able to work at her
own apartment. Deborah executed the
commission
faithfully and on her return told me
she
had procured employment for me at a
great
warehouse
, where
she
had been
recommended
by the
person
to whom I
sent
her.
But dear madam,
said
she
, the prices are
so
very
small
, you will never be able to live
on what you earn.This did not deter me.
I removed to a room near the
warehouse
for
which I was to work; that our time might
not be taken up in going backwards and
forwards
.
Deborah procured the work and I
executed it. I gave great
satisfaction
and had
as much as
myself
and Deborah could
possibly
do, yet with the
most
indefatigable
industry
,
we could
scarcely
earn eighteen or
twenty
shillings
a week. The
close
application
to my employment did not agree with
my health, and I was obliged to devote an
hour every day to
exercise
, nor did even this
answer
the
desired
end, and I was in a
short
K 2
time
so
pale and thin that you would
scarcely
have believed me to have been the Meriel
Howard you once knew. Ill as I was, I
still
continued my employment as well as I was
able; but
weakness
and fatigue often
overcame
me and I was obliged to give up hours
to
rest
, and
sometimes
whole days.
My
weakness
encreased
, and my income
proportionally
decreased
. I
saw
famine
advancing
with
hasty
strides
, and to add to
my affliction I knew the affection of
Deborah
had involved her in my
distresses
.
My lodging was in Oxford-
street
, and I
sometimes
walked into the fields which are
adjacent
to the
parish
of
Bloomsbury
. One day,
as with
slow
uneven pace I took my
accustomed
walk,
just
as I had reached
Gowerstreet
,
I
saw
a
splendid
equipage
pass
me and
stop
at a
house
which
seemed
newly
sitted
up. I cannot account for the
curiosity
that
seized
me; but I inquired of a man who had
the appearance of a Butler; to whom the
house
and carriage belonged.
To Mr. Howard
said
the manMr.
Howard; what Howard?
I don't know, he replied, what his
Christian
name is, but he is lately returned
from India.
Astonishment
rendered me
silent
, and the
man proceeded.
He came over about two months
since
,
and took that
house
. I then lived the next
door and knew all that
passed
in the family.
He brought a young lady over with him,
who is very pretty; but
seems
unhappy.
She is very young indeed; and he is going
to marry her; but I think it is
against
her
inclination: for though I have heard the
servants
say
she
seemed
to
respect
him,
she
often
declares
she
can never love him.
I
mused
upon what the man had told me
and was determined to inquire farther about
this Mr. Howard. It might be my brother,
and the
sums
I had advanced it might now be
in his power to return; not that I intended
to
ask
him for them but, methought,
natural
affection would certainly operate in his
bosom
in behalf of a
sister
who had
shared
all her property with him and was now bent
to the earth with
sickness
and
sorrow
.On
farther inquiry I learned that his name was
Richard Howard. Determined to make at
least
a trial of him, I learned at what hour
it would be
most
likely to
see
him, for as he
was become a great man, I readily
conceived
my only being his
sister
and in
distress
would but poorly plead my
excuse
for going
at an
unseasonable
time. Far be it from me,
my dear Celia, to
say
this is the
case
with
all, there are
some
glorious ornaments of
the creation who never turn from the
cry of affliction, and who never
consider
it
intrusive
;
whose
hearts are ever open and
whose
hands are ever ready to
dispense
to
those
who are in want, a part of
those
blessings
which a bounteous Providence has
showerd
on
themselves
:but the thorough
knowledge I have of the human heart led
me to reflect, that when a
person
has
unexpectedly
risen
to opulence from
obscurity
,
his feelings grow callous he forgets and
totally
neglects
those
branches of his family
who, though perhaps they have been
equally
industrious
with
himself
, have not been
equally the favourites of fortune.
At ten o'clock one morning, I knocked
at Mr. Howard's door; and was
requested
by the
servant
to
send
up my name, I did
so
, adding that I had particular
business
with him. After waiting about ten minutes
(for I
suppose
my
dress
had not
prepossessed
the man in my favour.) I was told I might
come up.My limbs trembled as I entered
the room. The
first
glance convinced me
it was my brother, though he is greatly
increased
in bulk, being now a very
stout
man,
and when we parted he was but a
slender
lad, yet his features were the
same
. He was
sitting
at
breakfast
with a very young lady,
who appeared dejected and unhappy. I
imagined
this to be the
person
of whom the
servant
spoke
.
He gave a
slight
inclination of the head
as I entered, the
servant
brought forward a
chair and left the room.
Now madam,
said
the haughty
master
of the
house
, what is your
pleasure
?
Is it
possible
,
said
I, looking
earnestly
at him, that you can have no recollection
of me?
Not the
least
, I do not recollect that I
ever
saw
you before.
You had once a
sister
,
sir
.
Yes I had, but
she
was always a
strange
eccentric girl;
she
ran through a very good
fortune, and I
understand
has
disgraced
her
family in the
most
shocking
maner.
Brother,
said
I, emphatically, and
I felt my eyes
gush
out with tears.
He
sat
down the cup, which he was
raising
to his lips, and with a look of mingled anger
and
astonishment
, cried, why
surely
you
can never be Meriel Howard.
I am your
sister
, I am all that remains
of Meriel Howard, but I no longer bear
that name.
I was told you had
assumed
the name
of a gentleman with whom you lived
some
years, but he has left you through your own
folly.
And who could
assert
such
a
falsehood
,
brother?
My Aunt
Mossop
told me, and
so
did
Hester
, who is well married.
Susan
wrote
them word that you behaved in
such
a
manner
some
few years
since
upon the continent,
as
occasioned
the
person
you lived with to
fight a duel on your account: that you
seperated
then and had never lived together
since
.
The flight, the cutting indifference of my
brother, wounded me to the
soul
. I was
debilitated in mind and body, yet I could
hardly
restrain
the
fulness
of my heart;
being
unable to
support
the interview any
longer, I
arose
to depart; for he had
neither
asked
me to eat or drink. The young
lady looked at me, and I
saw
the tear of
compassion
start
in her eyes.
I am very
sorry
, Meriel,
said
my
brother
,
that you are in
such
indifferent
circumstances
as your appearance
seems
to
bespeak
, if a couple of guineas
No,
sir
!
said
I, putting back the
hand extended with the money, if I am
unworthy
to be received as your
sister
, I am
unworthy of your
assistance
:
besides
,
brother
,
I came in hopes to find an
affectionate
relative, a friend,
whose
heart would
compassionate
my
sufferings
.
Disappointed
in thatI am too proud to accept a
donation
from your bounty!As you
please
,
madam! bowing coldly, had you
conducted
yourself
in a manner becoming my
sister
Brother, had I come to your door in a
splendid
equipage, perhaps, you would not
have inquired
so
strictly
into my conduct.
In that
case
even the errors of which I am
now
accused
, would have been overlooked;
but poverty is a fault the opulent can
seldom
pardon. I am happy, brother, to
see
the advancement of your fortune; but,
should
you ever experience a
reverse
, you
will then
discover
, that
those
who now
caress
and flatter you, nay, even would creep
into your favour by vilifying me, would be
the
first
to turn from you; and blame you
for misfortunes you could neither avoid nor
avert!
I
see
Meriel,
said
he, with a
sneer
,
you at
least
retain one
striking
trait in
your character, you are as good a preacher
as ever.
I will take care to retain every trait,
I replied, for which I have been
respected
.
I have now
lost
the name of Howard, and
can no longer
disgrace
it by my poverty;
and I hope my affluent brother will never
let that name be
dishonoured
by him.
I then bade him good morning,
without
being
requested
to renew my
visit
. I
was now
so
accustomed
to
disappointment
that I felt not this behaviour of my brother
so
severely
as I
should
have done
some
few
years
since
. Indeed, my dear friend, I think
my heart grows hard and
insensible
, and
seems
turning into
stone
, for it is cold and
inanimate. I can no longer exult in the
happiness
, or
sympathize
in the
miseries
of
my fellow creatures. The world appears
one
universal
blank, nay even when I think
of you and my Amelia, it
still
beats but
languidly
,
its emotions are no longer
exquisitely
pleasant
or painful; but like the faint rays
of an expiring taper now and then emits a
flash
of light that for a moment chears the
gloom of a
solitary
apartment, and after a
few
struggles
is entirely
extinguished
. So
my heart, which feels a degree of kindly
warmth play round it, when I think of your
affection, will perhaps a little longer
struggle
to illumine this frail tenement; then
sink
to
peace in the dark
mansion
of the grave.
But why
should
I
infest
you with my
melancholy
?
I fear I am an ungrateful wretch;
for I have found a friend when I
least
expected
it, and one who exerts his power to
preserve
a life that is no longer of value to
me;
because
it is entirely
useless
to
society
.
My poor Deborah too,
she
is
still
faithful
and affectionate. I have
still
much to be
thankful for; but
such
is the frailty of
human
nature, we remember our
sorrows
with
a repining mind, while we forget the
benefits
of which we we are unworthy
partakers
.
I have written this at various
opportunities
when my time and
strength
would
permit
.
I
shall
now
dispatch
it, as you are I
am
sure
ever anxious to hear from me, I will
write again
soon
, and believe, till my heart
vol. iv. L
is devoid of all
sensation
, it will ever love
you and pray for your
happiness
.
Adieu!
MERIEL.
LETTER LXIV.
MERIEL to CELIA.
August
19
th
, 1789.
My
dear friend, I have once more
set
down to
address
to you, to tell you
I every day draw nearer and nearer the
goal, to which we are all
hastening
, where
I
shall
again embrace my dear Clementina,
and be parted from her no more!I told
you, in my
last
, that I had unexpectedly
found a friend, who had
used
his
utmost
endeavours
to
serve
me. It was Mr.
Friendly
,
the gentleman to
whose
care, my
regretted
benefactor, Mr. Weldon,
so
strenuously
recommended me before he left England.
I was one morning at the
warehouse
, from
whence I had employment, when he came in
and with him a woman extremely gay in her
appearance; but many years younger than
himself
. She was what might by many
have been called pretty; but to me there
appeared nothing in her features that could
deserve
that name. It was an unmeaning
countenance, devoid of
sensibility
, and if it
had any character, it was that of pride and
impetuosity
.
She
purchased
some
very
expensive
articles
,
for which he
stopped
to pay, and
she
went off in the chariot, to make, as
she
said
,
some
morning
visits
. From what I
saw
, I feared the good old gentleman had
entered the matrimonial pale with a
person
no ways qualified to make him happy; and
the event proved I was not
mistaken
in my
conjectures. As I was
so
greatly altered in
person
, as not to be recollected by a
brother
,
I could not
suppose
Mr. Friendly
would know me; but I was
mistaken
; for
as I was
speaking
to the
person
who was
giving
me out my work, he turned round
hastily
and looked at me as though
endeavouring
to recollect my features.
There are but
small
remains of the
person
,
said
he, coming toward me, but I
could
almost
swear
that was the voice of
Miss
Howard. You know, Celia, I have
often been remarked for the
softness
of my
voice, and I believe many, who would not
otherwise
recollect me, know me the
moment
I
speak
. I
curtsyed
, acknowledged
he was right, and left the
shop
. I had not
proceeded many paces before he overtook
me, and offering me his arm, with the
solicitude
of a father, inquired into my
circumstances
.
He had heard I was well
married
,
but nothing more; my
present
appearance
did not confirm the report; he
wished
to know if he could
serve
me.
Before
I could
satisfy
his laudable
curiosity
, we
had reached the door of the
house
where I
lived.
I have an hour to
spare
,
said
he, may
I be admitted, I cannot leave you till I
know how you are
situated
. I am
perfectly
acquainted with the
goodness
of your
heart; but I know with all your virtues,
you have
weaknesses
more prejudicial to
your
interest
and
happiness
than
some
which
are called vices. You are credulous; and
you let a
sense
of duty
sometimes
hurry you
to actions which are not
strictly
right. Let
me know how you are
situated
; tell me
yourself
what has
seperated
you from your
husband
.
Shall I
confess
, my dear Celia,
shame
at
the mean apartment I occupied, for a
moment
crimsoned
my cheek; and made me
hesitate
to admit him up
stairs
; but
gratitude
for the kind
solicitude
he
expressed
, a
reverential remembrance of the noble
spirited
Weldon,
whose
friend he was:
conspired
to conquer this
unseasonable
emotion of
pride, and I led the way to my little garret,
(for
such
it literally is.) Deborah looked
surprised
at my introducing a man into an
apartment, which
constituted
our dining
room, drawing room, bed chamber, and
kitchen. But when
she
heard me mention
Mr. Weldon,
whose
name
she
knew I
respected
,
and
whose
friends I
should
ever
consider
as mine,
she
was perfectly
satisfied
;
and when
she
found the good old gentleman
meant to prove his
friendship
to Weldon,
by his attention to me, I thought
she
would
have gone wild with joy. She drew a chair
close
to his, nor could all my endeavours to
the contrary, prevent her informing him of
all
she
knew, concerning
Rooksby
; and
when
she
mentioned my drawing my
subsistence
L 2
from labour, and my evident ill
state
of health;
she
took his hand and
pressed
it
to her heart; while the tears rolled in big
drops down her aged face. I could not
see
her emotions unmoved: I
arose
from my
seat
and pretended to look after the dinner,
which Deborah, from her friendly anxiety
to promote my
interest
, had totally
neglected
;
and
unseen
, gave a
loose
to
sensations
which
almost
overpowered me.
Mr. Friendly would not leave me, till
he had prevailed with me to give up my
employment
,
to leave the place I then
inhabited
,
and go to apartments, which he would
provide a little way out of town.You
shall
not be obliged,
said
he, for I know
that is what would
most
afflict your proud
spirit
. You think you are humble, (added
he with a
smile
) but I know you better.
You ever was and ever will be very proud:
but I like you the better for it. It is the right
sort
of pride; it is a pride, which
shrinks
from the weight of obligation which it has
not power to return.Now to obviate
that, you have it in your power to oblige
me. I have taken a young creature under
my protection, (for I am quite a knight
errant
in the
cause
of the ladies,)
she
is, I
believe
,
a girl of good fortune, and
strictly
virtuous, but very unfortunate. Now if
you will take her for your companion and
teach her, as I know you
possess
abilities,
how to
amuse
at once her time and enrich
her mind, I will
supply
you with the means.
Some other time you may learn how I came
to take her under my care. Perhaps,
she
herself
, when
she
perceives the
gentleness
of
your nature, will confide more to you, than
from the difference of our
sex
she
possibly
could to me.
As to the means of your
support
, I have
some
connections, in the
island
of St. John's
in America, who
send
to me for thick cloaks,
&c. fit for the climate; now it
strikes
me
that you might make
those
garments, at a
good profit for
yourself
, and yet leave a
sufficient
for me.
When I found, he did not
wish
me to
receive
obligations from him, without
some
means to repay them, I was willing to
listen
to his plan, and in
less
than ten days
from the time I
first
saw
him, I was
removed
to apartments in
Islington
, where he
sent
the young lady to me, whom he had taken
under his protection. It was evening when
she
arrived; I was ill, I was fatiguedhad
retired to bed and
saw
her not till the next
morning. Oh! Celia, I am very ill now
my head is giddyI can proceed no farther
perhaps I may never
resume
the pen.
Let me tell you then, while I have power.
This lovely girl isI can no more
all is darkand
It was only a
faintness
. I am very
subject
to them lately,I am
something
better
to-day
and will, while Deborah permits me,
pursue
my narrative.
The young lady
intrusted
to my care is the
person
whom I
saw
at my brother's; and
who, to avoid an union with him, has left
his protection for that of a
stranger
's. She
tells me her name is Alton: that
she
was
born in England, but went over to India
whilst
an infant; that her mother being
obliged to go with a lady up into the
country
left her with a friend, who before her
mother's return was forced to retire from the
ravages of war: The friend to
whose
care
she
was
intrusted
had no child of her own
and at her death left her
heiress
to a very
handsome
fortune; the gentleman, who was
executor to the will, and guardian to
Miss
Alton
intrusted
her to the care of my
brother
that
she
might be brought home to
finish
her education. Struck with her
person
and the more powerful charms of twenty
thousand
pounds, he has left no means
untried
,
by which he could hope to win her
affection and draw her into a marriage; but
she
has ever regarded him, as
she
says
, with
more horror than any other
sensations
, when
she
has
considered
him as a man
designed
to
be her
husband
. He was extremely kind
and attentive to her, and in return,
she
respected
him and would do any thing to
promote
his
happiness
, except
sacrifice
her own.
She knew
so
little of the world, that
she
had
actually formed a
scheme
of working for her
bread, and did not even think
she
could
oblige my brother to do her
justice
or place
her at a proper
school
, and pay the
sum
her
guardian allowed both for her education and
pocket. She had not confided her real
situation
to Mr. Friendly, to whom I found
chance had introduced her. Poor innocent,
in
such
a place as London, how
soon
might
she
have been decoyed, by
seeming
friends
to ruin and infamy.
This
faintness
again. I declare I am as
weak as a child, every exertion overcomes
me.Deborah will let me write no longer.
God
bless
you.
MERIEL.
LETTER LXV.
DEBORAH ELLIS to MISS SHELBURNE.
Bristol
,
Oct.
9
th
, 1789.
MADAM,
Since
my lady
dispatched
her
last
letter
to you,
she
has been daily declining
and the faintings
she
mentioned
encreased
in
a
most
alarming manner. Mr. Friendly did
every thing in his power to make her
comfortable
,
and the young lady he placed with
her was very affectionate and tender; at one
time I was in hopes
she
would recover. But
a
circumstance
happened, that affected her
spirits
so
much as to make the
physicians
think it
necessary
to hurry her to this place
for the benefit of the waters. Mr. Friendly
generally called on her about twice a week,
and though to prevail on my dear lady, to
accept
assistance
from him, he frequently
talked and
consulted
her about work; yet
he never
sent
any to do, always making
ent">sent
any to do, always making
some-excuse
about its not being ready. He was,
however, fond of talking to her and
sometimes
he would bring the
newspaper
and
read to her, and whenever he gave her
money
said
it was for the board of
Miss
Alton.
It was one afternoon about
six
weeks ago,
as he
sat
at tea with the two ladies, a
chariot
stopped
at the door, a very fine lady
came out of it, and without any ceremony
threw open the dining room door, where they
were all
sitting
: and flying at my dear lady
abused
her in the
grossest
manner,
accused
her of being kept by her
husband
; for I
presently
found, madam, that this
dreadfully
passionate
lady was Mrs. Friendly, who
had traced her
husband
to the place where
he
so
often
visited
, and finding only two
women there,
she
immediately thought one
of them
must
be her
husband
's
mistress
, and
though my poor dear lady was
so
ill as might,
one would have thought, prevented any
such
suspicion
from being believed, yet did
she
insist
upon it. Mr. Friendly,
she
said
could maintain her there for no other
purpose
.
She called her every vile name, broke
the china and was only withheld by her
husband
from
striking
the innocent object of her
jealousy
, who
sat
as it were
stupified
with
terror, her hands were
clasped
and
rested
on her knees and her eyes were fixed on the
floor; but
she
spoke
not one word. Mr.
Friendly endeavoured to prevail on his wife
to go home; but
she
was deaf to his
entreaties
,
till he
promised
to accompany her.
Just
as
she
was going out,
she
turned round and
wished
my lady might
starve
and die in
prison
,
if ever
she
encouraged her
husband
to
come there again. I
should
like to
see
it,
said
she
, and if I
saw
you dying, I would
not give you a farthing to
save
you. You
have had enough from my poor, credulous,
foolish
husband
already and I hope the next
bit of bread you eat that is bought with his
money will choak you.
I do
suppose
, madam,
she
would have gone
on much longer, if her
husband
had not
almost
forced her into the carriage, which
drove
instantly
away. When they were
gone, my dear lady
raised
her eyes and
clasped
hands to Heaven, for what new
trials am I
reserved
!
said
she
, Poor
Miss
Alton was crying ready to break her heart,
and I
should
have been very glad to
see
my
poor
mistress
do the
same
: but
she
did not
shed
a
single
tear. She looked the very
picture
of uncomplaining
sorrow
. I was
frightened
to
see
her look
so
composed
, and as I
feared, her faintings which had kept off for
a few days before, now returned with
double
violence.
The next day, a gentleman came from
Mr. Friendly,
saying
, that for family
reasons
,
he could not
visit
her; but
desired
she
might want for nothing. This gentleman
waited, till the Doctor
visited
my lady, and
when he heard his opinion, that
Bristol
might be of
service
to her, he
desired
me to
make
instant
preparations for the journey.
I chearfully complied, as I found not only
the people, who kept the
house
, where we
lodged, but even the neighbours, had learned
something
of the
visit
of Mrs. Friendly, and
both my lady and
Miss
Alton were
considered
as bad women.
We travelled here by
easy
stages
, my lady
was greatly fatigued, and for many days I
did not expect her to live. The place
revived
in her mind the
loss
of her
Godmother
,
who died here about
sixteen
years ago, when my lady
first
left the
convent
.
The
physicians
here, comfort me,
by
saying
, they do not think
she
is in a
confirmed
consumption
; but that her
disorder
is chiefly on her
spirits
, and could that
depression
under which
she
evidently labours
be removed,
she
might yet recover, and
would undoubtedly, in a rapid manner.
Though I fear, madam,
she
will never
lose
that
depression
; yet I cannot but flatter
myself
something
may yet turn out to comfort

her. Surely it were a great pity
so
good
a lady
should
be cut off in the very flower
of her age, and that
she
, who never
wilfully
gave pain to any
person
,
should
be
dying
of a broken heart. Indeed, madam it
almost
breaks my old heart to think of it.
She is
some
days
so
well, as to be able
to walk to the pump room; but
she
has
herself
no idea, that
she
shall
ever leave this
place. She is perfectly
resigned
. She
desired
me to write to you and to tell you,
she
thinks
she
shall
never be able to write
herself
again. She offers you every kind
wish
and bids you pray for her
everlasting
peace.
Those
are her own words. One thing I was
desired
not to mention; but I cannot
conclude
without doing it. I have written twice
to Mr. Friendly,
since
we have been here:
but received no
answer
. Our money is
almost
gone, and
should
he
forsake
us, what
will become of my dear lady and poor
Miss
Alton, God knows; as for
myself
, I am
old, and could not hope to live much
longer
;
but for them, they have but
just
entered
the world as it were. Pardon me,
madam, for writing
so
much; but I am
very
uneasy
and have no one to complain to
or
advise
with. My lady
said
to me
yesterday
,
Deborah, I think I am better: we
will
dismiss
the
physician
to-morrow. Poor
lady, I knew her motive:
she
thinks her
money will not
last
long, and that
she
cannot
afford to pay him. I
wish
to Heaven,
Mrs.
Onslow
was in England or Mr.
Kingly
.
Oh! madam that my dear
blessed
lady
had been the wife of
such
a man as Mr.
Kingly, how happy would
she
have been;
and
she
might have lived years and years,
blessing
and
blessed
by all. But now
she
is
broken hearted,
forsaken
by the world and
with all her virtues will die unpitied and
unlamented
by all, except a few, who know how
good
she
is; and among which, none will
grieve with more
sincerity
than her and your
humble friend and
servant
,
DEBORAH ELLIS.
LETTER LXVI.
MERIEL to CELIA.
December
22
d
, 1789.
Strange
and
inscrutable
are the ways
of Heaven. Once more, my dear
Celia
,
I am permitted to
address
you, and I
have a tale of wonder to unfold, which even
at this moment, though I am
sensible
that I
live, I breathe, that all around me is
reality
,
yet, my
astonished
senses
can hardly,
credit!Celia, the
heaviest
afflictions may
lead to the
most
desirable
events. We
ought not to complain: every trial,
however
painful to be borne is inflicted for
some
wise
purpose
. Gracious Heaven! when I
think, how I have
nourished
one
secret
sorrow
;
how even in my
happiest
moments
have I brooded over it? but it is now
removed
.
That horror, that
inexpressible
horror, which for
so
many years has laid upon
my mind, is no more. I have been afflicted
'tis true: but I
trust
I am now
safe
at
least
from poverty. My health daily returns,
and I can enjoy the heart-felt
pleasure
of
relieving the
distressed
. But how, you will
say
, how have
these
changes taken place?
My dear friend, when the tumult of my
heart will permit me, I will tell you that I
am no longer the
friendless
,
distressed
creature
,
I was not long
since
. I have a
mother
living! I have a father too!
Blessed
!
blessed
words! and
those
whom I ever
considered
as my parents were only relations.
Mrs. Howard was
sister
to my mother.
But let me tell my tale with
some
coherence:
for I think my Celia will imagine me
wandering
from
reason
, and that I am writing
her the
effusions
of a
distempered
fancy.
While I was at
Bristol
, as long as I was
able, I went every morning to the pump
room.
Miss
Alton always accompanied me.
I there had
several
times an opportunity of
seeing
and
conversing
with Mrs. Harcourt,
who was detained there by the ill
state
of
her
husband
's health, who I found was at
Bath at the time I
first
saw
her, which was
the
occasion
of her attending the
examination
of the
persons
suspected
of robbing
her
house
. She frequently made me offers
of
friendship
, at the
same
time entreating
my confidence: but my
spirits
were not at
that time, in a
state
to permit me to relate
the incidents of my life,
most
of which had
M 2
been
so
extremely painful, that I
endeavoured
as much as was in my power to
banish
them from my memory.
Mr. Friendly, from family
reasons
, I
imagine
was deterred from inquiring for me,
after I left London, and the allowance he
had made me on account of
Miss
Alton's
being with me, till he could hear from her
friends abroad, entirely
ceased
when we had
been about a month in
Bristol
,
so
that I
became
again in very
necessitous
circumstances
,
which added to my having declined the
attendance of the
physician
, and omitted
going to drink the waters, on account of
my
slender
finances,
encreased
my
disorder
and I
soon
was confined to my bed.
Miss
Alton is a tender and affectionate girl and
would have confined
herself
to my
bedside
,
had I not
insisted
, that
she
should
sometimes
walk out. In one of
these
walks
she
met
Mrs. Harcourt, who inquired after me.
The friendly girl expecting every hour to
lose
me,
burst
into tears at the
question
,
described
my
situation
to Mrs. Harcourt and
entreated her to come and
see
me. Her own
humanity impelled her to comply, and that
very afternoon
she
came to my apartment.
She
seated
herself
by my
bedside
, took my
hand, and was beginning to
speak
; when
Deborah entered the room with
some
toast
and water which
she
had been down
stairs
to procure. Mrs. Harcourt
started
. The
glass
fell from Deborah's hand; for their
eyes met in the
same
moment. Good
gracious!
said
Deborah, am I awake
are you!no,it can't be!I
thoughtbut 'tis
impossible
!
Mrs. Harcourt had a little recovered
herself
.
Yes, Deborah,
said
she
, it is
possible
.
I am alive
still
, though
so
many years
thought dead.But tell meI
almost
fear to
ask
yet tell me, where is my
child?
Deborah came near. She took my hand
and put it into Mrs. Harcourt's,
pressed
them together, but remained
silent
.
Oh! gracious heaven!
she
exclaimed,
and is it indeed
so
? Then falling on the
bed, and throwing her arms round me,
she
cried, my child! my darling child! have
I found you then, only to
lose
you?Full
of
astonishment
and wonder, I could
scarcely
ask
the meaning of what I heard and
saw
.
How madam,
said
I, can I be your
child? Alas! my dear mother has been
many
years in the
silent
grave.You have
heard her mention a
sister
she
once had?
Yes, but I always
understood
she
was
dead before I was born.Dead to the
world I was,
she
replied, for many
years, and from a few weeks after your birth,
my
sister
never heard from me. Many
vicissitudes
have I experienced, far from
England
,
unable to hear from you, and above
ten years in captivity. When I again
saw
my native land and made inquiry for my
child and
sister
, I was told they were both
dead: Nor did I ever think to have been
so
blest
as this; but I
must
inquire my beloved
Meriel, when you are able to
answer
me. I
must
know how you have been
so
long hid
from me, and why it was reported you were
dead. Are my brother and
sister
Howard
both dead?
She might have proceeded in her
questions
uninterrupted; for
astonishment
had
deprived me of the power of
speech
. Yet
perfectly conceiving in a moment the
extreme
felicity of having a mother! a mother
who loved me, my heart
also
felt lightened
of a load of
anguish
. He, who had
attempted
my
seduction
was not my father;
he was no relation, only by marriage.
Celia
,
my beloved Celia, cannot you perfectly
comprehend the rapture that thought
conveyed
to my
soul
. Oh! my friendI am
certain, it is utterly
impossible
: for you are
unacquainted with guilt. The very idea of
it
inspires
you with horror; then, what
must
have been my feelings on the reflection, that
I had kindled a guilty
passion
, from which
nature
shrinks
back
aghast
!But human
nature, with all its frailties, could never
sink
into
such
depravity.Unable to
articulate
a
single
word, I threw my arms
round her neck and overpowered by the
pleasing
sensations
that
rushed
over my
heart, I
sunk
into
insensibility
. How long
I remained
so
, I cannot even conjecture;
but when I recovered, I
seemed
as though
awaking from a deep
sleep
, and was full of
the idea of a delightful dream.How
charmingly was that dream realized, when
putting back the curtain I
saw
my mother!
my kind affectionate mother,
sitting
by my
bedside
.How are you, my child,
said
she
, in an accent of the
softest
maternal
kindness
.
I was extremely faint, and could
scarcely
answer
, but yet I felt better and I told her
so
. From that hour I began to amend, and
was in the
course
of a few days able to be
removed to my mother's
house
, where I
was introduced to my father. Oh!
blessed
thought, that I
should
live to
say
I have a
father!a noble! honourable! father!
whose
every action of his life, is an eulogium
on the
goodness
of his heart; reflects a
credit on the nation of which he is a native,
and the religion of which he is not only a
professor
, but a
strict
follower of its
precepts
.
When I was taken from the lodgings
which I then occupied, to my dear mother's
house
, a new
source
of
astonishment
presented
itself
. My mother had a
person
with
her, whom I had often heard her mention
as an
esteemed
friend and companion. The
day after I was
settled
in her family, I was
introduced to this lady and
discovered
in her,
tho' greatly altered the
person
of Mrs. Talbot,
whom you may remember Mr. Howard kept
in a very unbecoming manner, even in the
house
with his wife, my dear, though
so
rigid
aunt.
She went abroad with a lady, who was
following a
husband
, whom
she
loved, and
who, from
necessity
, being an officer in the
army, had been
separated
from her. When
Mrs. Talbot left Woodbine-cott,
she
did
not know her own
situation
; but about
six
months after,
she
became the mother of a
girl. This girl
she
left in the care of a Mrs.
Alton, while
she
herself
accompanied her
lady
up the country in
search
of her
husband
.
A variety of incidents,
unnecessary
here to
relate, detained them
several
years from the
place where
she
left her child. On her
return
,
neither friend nor child were to be
found. Celia, do you not already know
that this child is the very
Miss
Alton, whom
my brother, as I have been
accustomed
to
call him, would have married. My
soul
shudders
, when I think of the
escape
he has
had. This
Miss
Alton, is his
sister
, the
natural
daughter of his father. Good
Heavens
!
to what
sins
are mortals led, as it
were blindfold; by the vices of their
parents
.
The meeting between the mother
and the daughter was very affecting. Mrs.
Talbot has retained
those
good
resolutions
,
with which
she
has been
pleased
to
say
I
first
inspired
her. She
lost
the friend whom
she
accompanied to India, when
she
had been
there about
six
years, and was
soon
after
recommended
to the notice of that excellent
woman, whom I have now the honour to
call mother! with whom
she
has
continued
ever
since
, as a companion, a friend,
and the
superintendent
of her family.
When I am more
composed
, and my
strength
will better permit me, I will give
you a few particulars of the life of this dear,
this new found parent; but at
present
, I am
not permitted to devote above an hour out of
the four and twenty to writing, and this letter
has been the fruit of
several
efforts. I am
called away.Adieu!
Your's while I live.
MERIEL.
LETTER LXVII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
January
15
th
, 1790.
In
my
last
, I
promised
a few of the
particulars
of my mother's life, and I
will now give them without further preface.
She was
several
years younger than Mrs.
Howard; and when her
sister
was married,
was
still
at
school
. At the early age of
sixteen
,
she
became acquainted with Mr. Harcourt, the
only
son
of a wealthy
East
-India merchant,
with whom
she
entered into the
most
sacred
bonds before any part of either family even
suspected
there was an intimacy
subsisting
between them. Her father died
soon
after
this union had taken place, died
uninformed
of itand her mother followed him
before
she
had an opportunity to
disclose
the
secret
of her
situation
: for Mr. Harcourt
dreaded the anger of his family,
should
they
discover
that he had married a woman with
so
small
a fortune as two
thousand
pounds.
My aunt Howard, whom I
so
long
considered
as my parent, was then
settled
, and was
the only friend my mother had, to whom
she
dared impart her marriage, and to this
disclosure
she
was driven by
necessity
; for
she
found
herself
likely to become a mother.
Mr. Howard was at that time on a
visit
to a
friend
some
hundred miles from Woodbine
cott, and my aunt offered her
sister
an
asylum
,
there, till
she
should
be
released
from her
burthen
.
It was there I was born, and on the
very day of my birth
intrusted
to the care of
the faithful Deborah, who had been brought
up by my grandmother and married from
her
house
. She
solemnly
vowed never to
divulge the
secret
of my birth; and when
three weeks after, my aunt Howard was
delivered
of a child, who expired in a few
days, it was determined that
she
should
adopt
vol. iv. N
me and ever take care of me as her own, till
it
should
be in the power of my parents to
claim and acknowledge me.Deborah
alone, was privy to the
imposture
, and
worthy
has
she
proved
herself
of the confidence
placed in her. My father's friends having
cause
to
suspect
he had formed
some
attachment
,
which did not altogether coincide
with the plans they had formed for his
future
establishment
in life, had
sent
him off
on a commercial plan to Bengal,
whilst
my
mother was lying in.
Distracted
by this
intelligence
,
as
soon
as her
strength
permitted
,
she
resolved
to follow him; and
leaving
me in the care of Mrs. Howard,
she
embarked for India; but on her arrival at
Bengal learnt that her
husband
had
executed
his
commissions
at that place, and was
gone with
some
English
factors up the
country
:
impelled by a pure and ardent
affection
,
she
followed the route he had taken,
but in vain. War began to advance with
horrid
strides
, followed by
devastation
and
famine, and
whilst
searching
for her
husband
,
my mother fell into the hands of the
enemy. Lovely in her
person
, ornamented
with all the charms of youth,
she
was
considered
as a valuable prize among the
captives
,
and was
sold
to a merchant, who
purchased
slaves
for the Grand Segnior. By
long and
tiresome
journies
she
reached
Constantinople
and was
presented
to the royal
Turk, but fortunately her
person
did not
please
him, and
she
was only
purchased
,
merely to fill up the number of his wives;
without once receiving a
visit
from him, or
being
solicited
to entertain him in an
improper
manner. Ten years was
she
detained
in this place, where
she
says
her time would
have
past
pleasantly
enough, had it not been
for the remembrance of my father and
myself
;
but the thought of what might have
become of us, prevented her being happy or
receiving the
least
satisfaction
from the
various
scenes
of luxury and
amusement
that
daily
surrounded
her. In the
summer
season
,
the Grand Segnior
sent
his wives and
all the female part of his family in large
parties to the different
houses
he had in the
country: and in one of
these
excursions
my
mother was
struck
with the appearance of a
slave
, who
used
to walk on a terrace before
the windows of the apartments appointed
for the women, apparently in a very ill
state
of health. In the party of woman of which
my mother made one was a beautiful turk,
who was
sister
to the Grand Signior, her
name was Zayde. She had ever
shewn
a
visible
partiality to my mother, and
cultivated
her
friendship
with the
utmost
care. She
endeavoured to attain from her
instructions
some
knowledge of the
English
language,
and
listened
with attention, when
she
strove
to
instruct
her in the precepts of the
Christian
religion.
This young
princess
perceiving one day,
that my mother regarded the
sick
slave
with
fixed attention, took an opportunity to tell
her, the
slave
was hers, that he was a
favourite
,
and had made an
impression
on her
heart.
I love him,
said
she
, but I have
never told him
so
. I only endeavour to
make his
servitude
less
painful by
shewing
him every
kindness
in my power; but
whenever
I tell him I am
sorry
to
see
him
so
unhappy
,
and
wish
I could remove the
cause
of his affliction, he
answers
, that his
sorrows
can never be
less
, till he is
restored
to
liberty and the love of a beautiful
Christian
,
who alone can render either life or liberty
desirable
. Thus much, continued
she
, I can
understand
; but as I cannot
fully
comprehend his meaning, I
wish
you
would
see
and talk to him
some
evening,
when, if you can learn from him, what will
be
most
conducive to his
happiness
, I will
exert my
utmost
power to procure it for
him.My mother complied with the
request
of Zayde, and one evening in the
middle
of July
she
accompanied her into the
garden
to give the
Christian
slave
the
promised
meeting.
The moon was at the fullbut the
atmosphere
was cloudy, and though it was
possible
to
distinguish
objects, yet the light was
not
sufficient
to permit a
discrimination
of
features.
She
addressed
the
slave
in
English
, told
him how much Zayde was
interested
in his
behalf, and begged to learn from him,
what could be done to comfort his mind,
and
assist
in the
restoration
of his health.
I might
say
, replied the
slave
, that
liberty would
restore
me to all I
so
feelingly
regretbut, alas! lady, I have
lost
what
it is not (I greatly fear) in the power of
fate to
restore
.Married in early youth
to a lovely woman, who, to the charms of
an engaging
person
, added all the
fascinating
beauties of a pure and elevated mind,
and
separated
from her in the very moment
when the delicacy of her
situation
most
required
a
husband
's
tenderness
and fond
solicitude
,
think what I
must
suffer
from an
absence
of eleven years, without having once heard
whether either
herself
or child are living.
Sent from England by the cruel,
pretended
tenderness
of parents, who valued wealth
N 2
above every other earthly
consideration
thrown by the chance of war into a
slavery
,
from whence I can never hope to
escape
; I
am, I feel am,
lost
to the world and dead
to every thing but a remembrance of what I
have been and what I now am.
Alas! it is very
sad
, replied my
mother
,
bending forward to wipe off the tears
she
felt trickling from her eyes.
Just
then the moon broke from the cloud
that had
obscured
her
brightness
and
shed
her beams full on the face of the
person
with whom
she
was
conversing
. A
scream
of mingled
surprise
and joy
escaped
her.
It was her
husband
, who under the
same
master
, for the
same
term of years had
endured
slavery
, and yet no lucky chance had
ever brought them together. Nay, even
when
she
had
observed
him on the terrace,
his
visage
was ever bent toward the earth,
and his hat pulled over his eyes, and
she
had no opportunity to
discover
features,
which however altered by
sickness
and
sorrow
were
still
fresh
in her memory,
still
dear to her heart.
They candidly revealed their
situation
to
the generous Zayde, who was indefatigable
till
she
had contrived the means for their
efcape
.And
will not you accompany us,
said
my mother, when
she
informed her
of the plan
she
had laid, and gave into their
hands the means of putting it in
execution
.
No,
she
replied, you my dear friend
have taught me the foundation of the
Christian
religion; it teaches us to
compassionate
and relieve the
distresses
of our fellow
creatures
;
but it
also
teaches us never to
forsake
our parents. I have a mother living, who
is old. She
says
, I am her only comfort.
It will be wrong to leave her, to deprive
her of what
constitutes
her whole felicity.
Go then, my friends, embrace this
opportunity
of emancipating
yourselves
from
slavery
: leave me to the performance of my
duty: and pray for me, that though I do
not, perhaps,
pursue
the right
Christian
mode of
worship
, yet, that the offerings of
a
sincere
and grateful heart may be accepted
at the throne of mercy.
With eyes and hearts overflowing with
gratitude and affection did my parents take
leave of this fair benevolent Mahometan;
but though they regained their liberty,
various
incidents prevented their return to
England
,
till within
these
four years
last
past
.
They had frequently written to inquire after
me; but never received any
answer
; and
when they arrived were informed from many
people that all Mr. Howard's family were
dead, except the
son
, who was abroad.
Mr. Harcourt found that his own family,
except
some
distant
branches, were entirely
extinct, and that a large fortune waited only
his appearance and proper claim. This he
is now
master
of, and to this I am now the
acknowledged
heiress
.
Caressed
by my
parents
,
respected
once more by the world,
who now again behold me
surrounded
by
affluence, my health and
spirits
daily
returning
,
what have I more to
wish
for?
Alas! Celia, we are never content, and I
most
ardently
desire
my poor
Rooksby
's
reformation
to complete my felicity.Kingly
too, I could
wish
to hear that he was well
and happy. But I will offer the
sacrifice
of
thanksgiving
for the
blessings
I have received,
and for futurity
trust
entirely to a
wise
and
bountiful Providence, who has never yet
forsaken
me, and who I humbly hope never
will.
I have been once to
see
Kingly's children;
my mother went with me: they are both well.
Clara's children are at the
same
school
and
enjoy the
same
advantages. Generous Kingly
may heaven reward you for the
disinterested
kindness
you have
shewn
these
poor orphans,
for indeed they are literally
so
, being
forsaken
by both father and mother.
My dear Celia, pray for me, that I may
support
this unexpected, this wonderful
elevation
of fortune as I ought, that while I
share
the
pleasures
of affluence I may never
forget the pangs of poverty or turn a deaf
ear to the cry of affliction.
Adieu!
MERIEL.
LETTER LXVIII.
FREDERIC KINGLY, ESQ. to COL. ONSLOW.
April
16
th
, 1790.
I am
returned to England once more; for
my mind was
so
harassed
by the thoughts
of what might be the fate of my beloved
Meriel, that my health declined, and I was
advised
to
solicit
an exchange and return to
my native place; where the air might
restore
me. I complied with the advice of my
friends, not from any opinion of my own
that I was in danger, for the complaints of
the mind are
so
far
superior
to
those
of the
body, that I was not
sensible
of my own
declining
state
. Meriel, in affliction, without
friends, without
support
, continually
haunted
my imagination.
On my arrival in England, I went
immediately
to my agent. He had heard no
tidings
of her. His heart was not
interested
;
he had therefore made only a few inquiries
and finding them
fruitless
, had given up the
search
.I determined to remain a few days
in London to
rest
after the fatigues of my
voyage and then
visit
my dear boys.My
time hung heavy on my hands and I
sauntered
into a coffee
house
towards the
close
of evening. A brother officer
accosted
me;
we chatted a few moments on indifferent
subjects
, and he
proposed
going to the
play. I accompanied him
just
to while away
the time, rather than from any hope of
amusement
.
Just
before the curtain
rose
,
an elderly gentleman entered the box
opposite
to that in which I was
sitting
,
leading
a lady, whom at the
first
glance, I
knew to be my adored, my lovely Meriel.
Health again adorned her countenance and
sparkled
in her eyes; yet there was
impressed
on her features a
sort
of
pensive
shade
, which
seemed
to
say
,
she
might
be happier. Her
dress
though,
sweetly
simple
,
and becoming, yet
bespoke
the wearer
in affluent
circumstances
, and the
assidious
attention of the gentleman, who
accompanied
her, was evidently the
effusions
of
tenderness
. She received them with
complacency
;
nay, returned them with looks
beaming
expressive
affection.
A young man in the box with me
observed
the emotions in my counteance,
whilst
I
regarded
her.Do you know that lady,
said
he,I think I do
sir
, I have
some
idea that her name is
Rooksby
.
I don't know her name,
said
he, but
she
is a damn'd pretty creature, and that
old fellow
deserves
to be gibbetted for
monopolizing
her.
A chill of horror ran through my heart;
can Meriel Howard,
said
I, mentally, be
sunk
from that eminence of virtue, which
ever
distinguished
her, into
so
low,
so
pitiable
a character, as to
exist
on the wages
of
prostitution
? Does
she
live with that
gentleman?
said
I, to my intelligencer.
'Tis thought
so
, he replied,
she
is
quite a new face. I have
seen
her often in
public with him, and
she
seldom
is
accompanied
by any one but an old woman, who
looks like a convenient.
And is that all the
reason
you can give
said
I fiercely, for injuring the character
of a woman that ever was, and I
trust
ever
will be free from
blemish
.
Oh! no,
said
he, when I
first
saw
her,
it was at the opera; and I was told
she
was
a woman of that
stamp
; for
she
left her
husband
about a year and a half ago and lived
with a young officer of the name of Kingly.
I was going to
answer
with great warmth
and inquire the name of the
person
, who
had thus dared to
sport
with my character;
but my friend
interposed
and obliged me to
quit the play-
house
without any farther
information
.
This
transient
glance of my dear Meriel,
added to the villainous
assertions
of the
impertinent
coxcomb, who vilified her name,
had
such
an effect on my
spirits
, that
rest
was a
stranger
to my eyes. I had not
inquired
the name of the gentleman with whom
I
saw
her: it was therefore
impossible
to trace
her out. For many evenings I frequented
the theatres, the opera-
house
every place
of public
amusement
; but was
still
unsuccessful
.
She was not at any, or if there,
was effectually concealed from me.
Unhappy
,
ill,
disgusted
with every object that
surrounded
me, I determined one morning
to
visit
my children, who I had
previously
heard, were well, and endeavour to
lose
my
chagrin in their innocent
caresses
. The
school
they were at is about twenty-five miles from
town. I took a
post
chaise
and arrived at
the place about eleven o'clock. An elegant
carriage
stood
at the gate, which drew off to
VOL. IV. O
give me room to alight. I
asked
the
servant
who opened the gate, for my boys. They
are in the parlour,
said
he; I followed him,
in fancy anticipating their dear embraces.
He threw open the parlour door. I
advanced
and
saw
,
seated
at the upper end of the
room,
surrounded
by the four boys, (for
Clara's children are there)
distributing
to
them, toys and fruit, the
interesting
figure
of Mrs.
Rooksby
.
Astonishment
riveted me
to the floor. She looked toward me; joy
flashed
from her eyes. An exclamation of
surprise
escaped
her, and before either of us
had time for reflection, I found I had
seated
myself
beside
her and
clasped
her in my arms,
while the dear children were climbing round,
each
striving
to be the
first
to
share
my
caresses
.
However joy had for a moment made
her forget
herself
,
she
soon
recovered her
usual
air of cautious timidity and
disingaging
herself
from my embrace,
she
presented
me to an
elderly lady, whom till then I had not
observed
;
and whom
she
addressed
by the
endearing
title of mother. They
proposed
taking the children home with them and
dismissing
my
chaise
to take a
seat
in their
coach and all return to town together.
During our ride,
she
unfolded to me a tale
of wonder,
unnecessary
here to repeat;
because
she
informed me
she
has written your
Amelia a full account of it.
I am a frequent
visitor
at Mr. Harcourt's
and enjoy her
society
undisturbed
by the
fears of the world's
censure
; for under the
shelter
of paternal protection, who
shall
dare
to arraign her conduct? She informs me
she
has not heard from her
husband
,
since
his
release
from the King's bench: but imagines
he is wandering abroad with the wild Clara.
You will hardly believe it
possible
, that
young Howard, who
refused
to
assist
or
even acknowledge the dear Meriel, when
she
was in
distress
and he thought her his
sister
, has been to pay his
respects
to her
since
he has
discovered
she
is a wealthy
relative
.
She received him politely; but did
not
ask
him to repeat his
visit
. He is
affluent
,
said
she
, he does not want
assistance
,
and I do not
wish
to be
pestered
with
his company.
Far different was her conduct to
Hester
Mossop
, who is now a widow with three
children and in very indigent
circumstances
.
She met Mrs.
Mossop
by accident at a
perfumer's
shop
, and judging from her
appearance
that
she
was no longer the wealthy,
haughty woman, who had never known
distress
,
accosted
her in a manner, that
encouraged
her to make her a
visit
; nay,
she
entreated
her to do
so
. From her
she
learned
Hester
's
necessities
, and
hesitated
not a
moment
to exert her benevolence to remove
them. She inquired after
Susan
. Tears
were the only
answer
she
received.Alas!
poor
Susan
!
seduced
by Belger, led into all
manner of folly by Clara,
she
fell from one
degree of vice to another, till
oppressed
by
the complicated evils of infamy,
disease
and
a broken heart,
she
sunk
into an untimely
grave, in her
last
hours in want of the
common
necessaries
of life. Meriel gave a tear
to her memory and to
sooth
the affliction of
the mother immediately formed a plan for
Hester
's
support
. She advanced money for
her to take a
shop
furnished
well with
haberdashery
and
hosiery
; and by the many
recommendations
of Mrs. Harcourt,
she
is
likely
to gain a very decent
subsistence
. Young
Mossop
is married to a rich
heiress
; but
they live in
some
town very
distant
from
London, and he found it quite inconvenient
to write and inquire after his mother and
sisters
.
I hope, now, we
shall
soon
see
you in
England: I feel uncommonly happy, and I
wish
you to
see
and
share
my
happiness
.
Methinks, the wheel of fortune has gone
its round: and we who have been thrown to
the very bottom, are now beginning to
rise
.
I
see
my dear Meriel enjoying all the
comforts
,
all the elegances of life
caressed
,
beloved
,
esteemed
by all, and I cannot help
indulging the flattering hope, (call it not
chimerical) that I
shall
one day call her
mine! Oh!
Onslow
when that
blest
hour
arrives! (if
such
an hour Heaven has in
store
for me) when I
shall
see
the affection
of her faithful heart beam from her
expressive
eyes, unchecked by fear, I
shall
think
myself
at the very
summit
of human felicity!
My
kindest
remembrances and
best
wishes
attend your Amelia.
Ever your's,
F. KINGLY.
P. S. Previous to Mrs.
Rooksby
's
assisting
Hester
, the poor creature made the
humiliating
confession
, that it was her artifices,
to which
she
was
instigated
by her mother,
that
first
separated
me from my beloved
Meriel
;
but that noble minded woman
frankly
forgave her; never witheld her
friendship
from her, and has never once
since
mentioned the
circumstance
.
O 2
LETTER LXIX.
MRS. ONSLOW to MISS SHELBURNE.
November
10
th
, 1790.
You
will perhaps be
surprized
, my
dear madam, to receive a letter from
a
person
to whom you are a
stranger
; but
though I never was honoured with the
acquaintance
of
Miss
Shelburne, yet
she
has no
doubt heard of Amelia Sidney, who has been
so
highly honoured by the
friendship
of our
equally beloved Mrs
Rooksby
.
That lady from a variety of incidents has
been prevented from writing to you for
several
months
past
; and I am now
desired
by her to inform you that
she
is in health;
but totally inadequate to the
task
of relating
to you the
scenes
in which
she
has been
lately engaged.I know her motive for thus
declining a
task
which
she
ever
considered
pleasurable
, that of writing to her
esteemed
Celia is delicacy:
she
cannot inform you of
what has lately occurred, without making
mention of her own magnanimity. Her
fortitude has ever been
conspicuous
, it has
sustained
her under
some
of the
heaviest
trials to which the human heart is incident;
but in this
last
she
has
risen
almost
above
humanity. Pardon the
expression
; for I am
fully
sensible
how much the human heart is
capable of, it is tempered by a great, an all
wise
Being, who will never inflict trials
beyond
our power to
support
;but we daily
see
such
instances
of depravity that we look
with a kind of wonder on
those
who through
life maintain that dignified conduct, that
purity of manner and
universal
benevolence
which is the true
characteristic
of
Christianity
.But
I intrude on your patience,
and defer the
interesting
narrative. To
proceed
then.
On my arrival in England after an
absence
of
six
years I was both
surprized
and
pleased
to
see
the alteration which had taken place
in the
circumstanes
of our friend. She had
regained all that
softness
, that delicacy of
countenance, for which
she
has been
universally
admired; but which
sickness
and
sorrow
had when I left her faded into langour.
She was chearful and apparently happy;
but
still
some
hours of painful reflection
would intrude; for
she
was totally ignorant
of the fate of her
husband
. He might
return to England, he might demand her
from her father and mother, when he found
her the affluent
heiress
of a large fortune.
These
ideas continually haunted her, and
sometimes
interrupted her
most
chearful
hours. Mrs. Harcourt had invited me to
spend
a few weeks with them at a
seat
of
their's
situated
on the banks of the Thames,
near
Windsor
. I accepted the invitation,
and had been there near three weeks, when
Mrs.
Rooksby
entered my appartment one
morning, pale and ready to
saint
. She
could not
speak
, but put a note into my
hands, which
she
had
just
received. It was
from Claraand in a few incoherent lines,
represented
Rooksby
in a
most
wretched
situation
,
dying and in the
utmost
distress
.
I had known
so
many
instances
of Clara's
art, that I endeavoured to
persuade
Mrs.
Rooksby
from the
resolution
,
she
had
formed
of going immediately to town and
administering
relief to her
husband
: but all
I could
say
, joined to the united entreaties
of her parents, could not prevail, and all I
could do was to accompany her. She
ordered
the coachman to
set
her down
according
to the direction contained in Clara's
billet
.
It was at a mean
house
in an
obscure
street
in
Westminster
. We enquired for her
husband
by the name of Moreton, and was
shewn
up two pair of
stairs
into a
small
back
room, where on a bed without hangings,
lay all that remained of the once elegant
affluent
Rooksby
, worn to a
skeleton
, and in
the very
last
stage
of a decline, (for he had
never recovered the effects of the wound)
and riot and intemperance had
hastened
the
period of his
existence
.
Beside
the bed,
(
supporting
his head on her arm, the tears
flowing from her eyes)
sat
Clara: but I
could never have conceived it to be the
lovely
Clara, who had
stolen
the heart of
Rooksby
from our dear friend, for her
appearance
was
squallid
and
miserable
. Sunk
eyes, pale cheeks, every indication of
disease
and poverty was marked upon her
person
.
She turned her eyes towards us as we
entered
,
but without changing her attitude.
She has very fine eyes and in
spite
of their
languor
still
retained
sufficient
expression
, to
inform us, that
she
was equally
oppressed
by the
situation
of the poor
sufferer
on the
bed, and
shame
at appearing in the
presence
of the woman
she
had injured beyond
reparation. Our excellent Meriel
advanced
,
(checking the powerful feelings of her
heart) and as with one hand,
she
took one
of her dying
husband
's,
she
extended the
other towards Clara: and in accents
scarcely
audible, bade her be comforted. Struck
by
such
an uncommon proof of
benevolence
,
the poor
suffering
criminal
sunk
on
her knees. She
clasped
the hand extended
towards her,
raised
her
streaming
eyes;
but could not give vent to the
fullness
of
her heart by words.
Go, cried our magnanimous Meriel,
go, my poor penitent Clara, and
compose
yourself
: I will
stay
and attend my
husband
:
then turning to me,
she
continued,
Shall I entreat you Amelia to return and
inform my parents that you have left me in
the performance of my duty: that you have
left me attending the
sick
bed of a
husband
,
who
raised
me from
obscurity
to an elevated
fortune: tell them, I remember not his
errors
they
were the children of human
nature:but his benevolence will never
be obliterated from my mind.That
was the offspring of Heaven.As
she
spoke
,
she
waved her hand; I found it was
impossible
to
disobey
her, and retired from
the apartmentbut not from the
house
. I
dispatched
a
short
note to Mrs. Harcourt and
then exerted
myself
to obtain for
Rooksby
,
and my dear rigidly duteous friend, every
assistance
which money could procure.It is
a
sad
thing to acknowledge, but
so
it was,
those
very people who had
suffered
Rooksby
and Clara to want even the means to
support
existence
,
whilst
they thought them
destitute
of friends and money, no
sooner
saw
them
visited
by
persons
, who were
supposed
wealthy
,
and beheld the contents of my
purse
,
which fortunately was amply
supplied
, than
they were ready to run! to fly! to
perform
any dirty, or painful work for which
they expected to be well paid. But I mean
not to make human nature
despicable
by this
observation
.
These
people were poor.And
God knows we may all yield to temptations,
when poverty is the
strong
incentive.
I heard from my friend every hour, though
she
herself
imagined I was returned to her
father and mother. About midnight I heard
an extraordinary
bustle
up
stairs
, and on
inquiring the
cause
, found that
Rooksby
who had never been able to
speak
to his
angelic wife more than
monosylables
,
since
her arrival, had been
seized
with a kind of
fit, and was expected every moment to
expire
.
I thought it improper for Mrs.
Rooksby
to be left in
such
a
situation
to the entire
care of
strangers
, and therefore
sent
up word
that I was returned from the country with a
message
from her mother, and if
she
pleased
would come up. She
said
,
she
would be
happy to
see
me. When I went into the
room I found her
seated
on the bed,
supporting
her dying
husband
, who was at that time
easy
and
seemingly
dozing. His right arm
was encircling her
waist
, his head
rested
on
her
bosom
,
she
pointed to a chair by the
bedside
, but did not
speak
. On the
opposite
side
of the bed,
stood
a woman with volatiles
which they had been applying to the
nose
and temples of the expiring man; and at
the foot was Clara on her knees her eyes
elevated, her hands,
clasped
, and her whole
countenance bearing
testimony
to the
anguish
that rent her
soul
. In my life, I never
saw
a more
interesting
scene
, nor never I hope
shall
I
witness
such
another.I
sat
down
in
silence
, and in a few moments the
Physician
,
whom Mrs.
Rooksby
had
sent
for
arrived. He pronounced the patient
past
all hope, and a few hours confirmed the
sentence
. It was near
seven
o'clock, when
starting
as it were from
sleep
, he gazed
ardently
on his wife.
Oh Meriel,
said
he, I dreamt I was
in the realms of
bliss
and you conducted me
there.
Blessed
woman, if you forgive me,
if you pray for my enterance into that
place of eternal peace; I
shall
, I know
I
shall
, be received.Oh!
said
she
,
with fervour, May Heaven
so
forgive my
offences as I pardon every offence of yours
toward me.But Clara, cried he,
poor guilty Clara!I will be her
friend, replied Mrs.
Rooksby
. Enough,
said
he, may every
blessing
crown you
here, and
everlasting
joysHe could
not
finish
the
sentence
, but remained
silent
and
almost
inanimate for the
space
of half an
hour. He then moved and took a cordial
which
she
offered him. I prevailed on her
to quit her painful
situation
at the head of
the bed and let him lye down. She did
so
, but he
still
retained her hand.
Just
before the final
scene
closed
, he
raised
himself
a little, and looking
earnestly
in her
faceMy children, he cried, my dear
boys.Are they not mine,
she
replied in
an accent to which no words can do
justice
.
Oh! what a wretch I have been!!!
said
he.His head
sunk
on her
shoulder
,
he endeavoured to throw his arms around
her, but Death had
arrested
their power.
He groaned
struggled
for the power of
utteranceand in that
struggle
expired.
I knew the extreme
sensibility
of the
heart with which I had to deal. I
attempted
not to
console
her, I rather encouraged
her to give a
loose
to her feelings, and in a
few hours
she
became
sufficiently
composed
to
submit
to my direction, and
suffer
herself
to be conveyed to her father and mother:
vol. iv. P
but not 'till
she
had given proper directions
for the future
support
of Clara. This
unhappy
woman
confessed
in the
anguish
of her
heart, that at the very moment when our
incomparable friend gave her
assistance
and
countenance in
Devonshire
,
she
was ploting
her ruin, that the chief part of the letter
she
wrote to her, and of which you have had a
copy was the invention of her own brain,
and that from a very child
she
has been the
offspring of folly.
Mrs.
Rooksby
heard her
confession
without
any emotion,
save
that of
compassion
,
and when
she
had
finished
, bade her not
despair
but
resolve
on a new
course
of life,
and
trust
in that bounteous Creator for
pardon
,
who never turned from the truly
penitent
.She
has
sent
this unfortunate and I
may
say
guilty woman into Wales, were
she
has become
responsible
for her board, and
allows her ten pounds a year for her pocket
and extra expences. The children
she
has
taken entirely under her own care.
My dear
Miss
Shelburne, I cannot help
now indulging the
most
sanguine
hopes,
that I
shall
see
this worthy woman rewarded
for all her
sufferings
;
shall
see
her
soon
united to the man to whom for many years
she
has been
sincerely
attached, and from
whom only the
most
cruel treachery could
have
separated
her;for
Hester
Mossop
has
confessed
that
she
was the author of
those
letters which prevented her union with
Rainsforth. We do not let Mr. Harcourt
know that
Hester
has made this
confession
,
for he would never forgive her, and I much
fear would
insist
on Mrs.
Rooksby
's
with-drawing
her
friendship
entirely from her.
Mrs.
Rooksby
bid me
say
she
will write
as
soon
as
she
is able, and in the mean time
desires
you will believe
she
can never be
otherwise
than your friend, and in the
same
rank begs leave to be placed,
Your obliged
AMELIA ONSLOW.
LETTER LXX.
MERIEL to CELIA.

Several letters between this and the preceding,
are omitted.
Sept.
29
th
, 1791.
I have
foreborn to write;
because
I
knew my dear Amelia had informed
you of every material occurrence. I knew
she
had told you that I had
promised
after
my year of mourning was expired, to give
my hand to the man, who
first
possessed
my
heart. That year was ended on this very
day, and I am now the wife of Kingly. I
could
almost
find it in my heart to renounce
the name and
say
, I am the wife of
Rainsforth
.
My dear Celia, pray for me, that the tide
of joy, which now
rushes
on my heart, may
not impair my gratitude, or lead me through
my adoration of the creature to forget the
Creator, to whom only adoration is due.
Oh, Heavenly Providence! am I indeed
thus happyyes, it is a
blest
reality. I can
look up to a father to whom it is an honour
to be allied. I can
see
the
sweet
effusions
of
maternal
tenderness
beam on me from a
beloved
mother's eyes. I am united to the
man of my heart, I am the adopted mother
of his children.Where! where! is there a
human being as
superlatively
happy as
myself
?
happier they cannot be. I can lay my
hand on my heart and fervently pray even
for the felicity of my enemies. Enemies did
I
say
, I will forget I ever had any,
past
scenes
of
sorrow
shall
be obliterated from my
memory
,
and remembering only the
present
happiness
I will endeavour to
deserve
its
continuation, by exerting the abilities with
which I am amply endowed to chear the
desponding
heart,
sooth
the afflicted
spirits
and
soften
the bed of pain!Whatever injuries
I have received, I will repay with
kindness
!
and looking round the world with a
smile
of tranquillity,
wish
every being as
transcendently
happy as
myself
!
Mrs.
Onslow
desires
remembrances to you.
My
husband
bids me
say
,
should
the
commotions
which at
present
agitate the Gallic
shore
,
disturb
you in your religious retreat;
remember, you have a home, to which you
can with confidence repaira home, where
you will be received with
transport
, and
where you may
consider
yourself
in the
mansion
of a
sister
! Heaven
bless
and protect
you, is the ardent prayer of your friend in
sincerity
.
MERIEL KINGLY.
THE END.
