EDGAR HUNTLY;
OR,
MEMOIRS OF A SLEEP-WALKER.
CHAPTER XI.
Next
morning I stored a
small bag with meat and bread, and
throwing an axe on my shoulder, set
out, without informing any one of my
intentions, for the hill. My passage
was rendered more difficult by these
incumbrances, but my perseverance
surmounted
every impediment, and I gained,
in a few hours, the foot of the tree, whose
trunk was to serve me for a bridge.
In this journey I saw no traces of the
fugitive.
A new survey of the tree confirmed
my former conclusions, and I began my
work with diligence. My strokes were
repeated by a thousand echoes, and I
paused at first somewhat startled by
reverberations
,
which made it appear as if not
one, but a score of axes, were employed
at the same time on both sides of the gulf.
Quickly the tree fell, and exactly in the
manner which I expected and desired.
The wide-spread limbs occupied and
choaked up the channel of the torrent,
and compelled it to seek a new outlet
and multiplied its murmurs. I dared not
trust myself to cross it in an upright
posture
,
but clung, with hands and feet, to
its rugged bark. Having reached the
opposite cliff I proceeded to examine the
spot where Clithero had disappeared. My
fondest hopes were realised, for a
considerable
VOL. II. A 2
cavity appeared, which, on a
former day, had been concealed from
my distant view by the rock.
It was obvious to conclude that this
was his present habitation, or that an
avenue, conducting hither and
terminating
in the unexplored sides of this pit,
was that by which he had come hither,
and by which he had retired. I could
not hesitate long to slide into the pit. I
found an entrance through which I
fearlessly
penetrated. I was prepared to
encounter obstacles and perils similar to
those which I have already described,
but was rescued from them by
ascending
,
in a few minutes, into a kind of
passage, open above, but walled by a
continued rock on both sides. The sides
of this passage conformed with the utmost
exactness to each other. Nature, at some
former period, had ccasioned the solid
mass to dispart at this place, and had thus
afforded access to the summit of the hill.
Loose stones and ragged points formed
the flooring of this passage, which rapidly
and circuitously ascended.
I was now within a few yards of the
surface of the rock. The passage opened
into a kind of chamber or pit, the sides
of which were not difficult to climb. I
rejoiced at the prospect of this
termination
of my journey. Here I paused, and
throwing my weary limbs on the ground,
began to examine the objects around me,
and to meditate on the steps that were
next to be taken.
My first glance lighted on the very
being of whom I was in search. Stretched
upon a bed of moss, at the distance of a
few feet from my station, I beheld
Clithero
.
He had not been roused by my
approach, though my foot-steps were
perpetually
stumbling and sliding. This
reflection gave birth to the fear that he
was dead. A nearer inspection dispelled
my apprehensions, and shewed me that
he was merely buried in profound
slumber
.
Those vigils must indeed have been
long which were at last succeeded by a
sleep so oblivious.
This meeting was, in the highest
degree, propitious. It not only assured
me of his existence, but proved that his
miseries were capable to be suspended.
His slumber enabled me to pause, to
ruminate on the manner by which his
understanding might be most
successfully
addressed; to collect and arrange
the topics fitted to rectify his gloomy
and disastrous perceptions.
Thou knowest that I am qualified
for such tasks neither by my education
nor my genius. The headlong and
ferocious
energies of this man could not be
repelled or diverted into better paths by
efforts so undisciplined as mine. A
despair
so stormy and impetuous would
drown my feeble accents. How should
I attempt to reason with him? How
should I outroot prepossessions so
inveterate
;
the fruits of his earliest education,
fostered and matured by the observation
and experience of his whole life. How
should I convince him that since the
death of Wiatte was not intended, the
deed was without crime; that, if it had
been deliberately concerted, it was still
a virtue, since his own life could, by no
other means, be preserved; that when
he pointed a dagger at the bosom of his
mistress he was actuated, not by avarice,
or ambition, or revenge, or malice. He
desired to confer on her the highest and
the only benefit of which he believed
her capable. He sought to rescue her
from tormenting regrets and lingering
agonies.
These positions were sufficiently just
to my own view, but I was not called
upon to reduce them to practice. I had
not to struggle with the consciousness of
having been rescued by some miraculous
contingency, from embruing my hands
in the blood of her whom I adored; of
having drawn upon myself suspicions of
ingratitude and murder too deep to be ever
effaced; of having bereft myself of love,
and honour, and friends, and spotless
reputation; of having doomed myself to
infamy and detestation, to hopeless exile,
penury, and servile toil. These were the
evils which his malignant destiny had
made the unalterable portion of Clithero,
and how should my imperfect eloquence
annihilate these evils? Every man, not
himself the victim of irretreivable
disasters
,
perceives the folly of ruminating
on the past, and of fostering a grief
which cannot reverse or recall the
decrees
of an immutable necessity; but
every man who suffers is unavoidably
shackled by the errors which he
censures
in his neighbour, and his efforts to
relieve himself are as fruitless as those
with which he attempted the relief of
others.
No topic, therefore, could be
properly
employed by me on the present
occasion. All that I could do was to
offer him food, and, by pathetic
supplications
,
to prevail on him to eat. Famine,
however obstinate, would scarcely
refrain
when bread was placed within sight
and reach. When made to swerve from
his resolution in one instance, it would
be less difficult to conquer it a second
time. The magic of sympathy, the
perseverance
of benevolence, though silent,
might work a gradual and secret
revolution
,
and better thoughts might
insensibly
displace those desperate suggestions
which now governed him.
Having revolved these ideas, I placed
the food which I had brought at his
right hand, and, seating myself at his
feet, attentively surveyed his
countenance
.
The emotions, which were
visible
during wakefulness, had vanished
during this cessation of remembrance
and remorse, or were faintly discernible.
They served to dignify and
solemnize
his features, and to embellish those
immutable lines which betokened the
spirit of his better days. Linaments
were now observed which could never
co-exist with folly, or associate with
obdurate guilt.
I had no inclination to awaken him.
This respite was too sweet to be
needlessly
abridged. I determined to await
the operation of nature, and to prolong,
by silence and by keeping interruption
at a distance, this salutary period of
forgetfulness
.
This interval permitted new
ideas to succeed in my mind.
Clithero believed his solitude to be
unapproachable. What new expedients
to escape inquiry and intrusion might
not my presence suggest! Might he not
vanish, as he had done on the former
day, and afford me no time to assail his
constancy and tempt his hunger? If,
however, I withdrew during his sleep,
he would awake without disturbance,
and be, unconscious for a time, that his
secrecy had been violated. He would
quickly perceive the victuals and would
need no foreign inducements to eat. A
provision, so unexpected and
extraordinary
,
might suggest new thoughts, and
be construed into a kind of heavenly
condemnation of his purpose. He would
not readily suspect the motives or person
of his visitant, would take no precaution
VOL. II. B
against the repetition of my visit, and, at
the same time, our interview would not
be attended with so much surprise. The
more I revolved these reflections, the
greater force they acquired. At length,
I determined to withdraw, and, leaving
the food where it could scarcely fail of
attracting his notice, I returned by the
way that I had scarcely
reached home, when a messenger from
Inglefield arrived, requesting me to spend
the succeeding night at his house, as
some engagement had occurred to draw
him to the city.
I readily complied with this request.
It was not neccessary, however, to be
early in my visit. I deferred going till
the evening was far advanced. My way
led under the branches of the elm which
recent events had rendered so
memorable
.
Hence my reflections reverted to
the circumstances which had lately
occurred
in connection with this tree.
I paused, for some time, under its
shade. I marked the spot where Clithero
had been discovered digging. It shewed
marks of being unsettled, but the sod
which had formerly covered it and which
had lately been removed, was now
carefully
replaced. This had not been done
by him on that occasion in which I was
a witness of his behaviour. The earth
was then hastily removed and as hastily
thrown again into hole from which
it had been taken.
Some curiosity was naturally excited
by this appearance. Either some other
person, or Clithero, on a subsequent
occasion
,
had been here. I was now likewise
led to reflect on the possible motives that
prompted the maniac to turn up this earth.
There is always some significance in the
actions of a sleeper. Somewhat was,
perhaps, buried in this spot, connected
with the history of Mrs. Lorimer or of
Clarice. Was it not possible to ascertain
the truth in this respect?
There was but one method. By
carefully
uncovering this hole, and digging
as deep as Clithero had already dug, it
would quickly appear whether any thing
was hidden. To do this publickly by
daylight
was evidently indiscreet. Besides, a
moment's delay was superfluous. The
night had now fallen, and before it was
past this new undertaking might be
finished. An interview was, if possible,
to be gained with Clithero on the morrow,
and for this interview the discoveries
made on this spot might eminently
qualify
me. Influenced by these
considerations
,
I resolved to dig. I was first,
however, to converse an hour with the
house-keeper, and then to withdraw to
my chamber. When the family were all
retired, and there was no fear of
observation
or interruption, I proposed to rise
and hasten, with a proper implement,
hither.
One chamber, in Inglefield's house,
was usually reserved for visitants. In
this chamber thy unfortunate brother
died, and here it was that I was to sleep.
The image of its last inhabitant could not
fail of being called up, and of banishing
repose; but the scheme which I had
meditated
was an additional incitement to
watchfulness. Hither I repaired, at the
due season, having previously furnished
myself with candles, since I knew not
what might occur to make a light
necessary
.
I did not go to bed, but either sat
musing by a table or walked across the
room. The bed before me was that on
which my friend breathed his last. To
rest my head upon the same pillow, to lie
VOL. II. B 2
on that pallet which sustained his cold
and motionless limbs, were provocations
to remembrance and grief that I desired
to shun. I endeavoured to fill my mind with
more recent incidents, with the disasters
of Clithero, my subterranean adventures,
and the probable issue of the schemes
which I now contemplated.
I recalled the conversation which
had just ended with the house-keeper.
Clithero had been our theme, but she had
dealt chiefly in repetitions of what had
formerly been related by her or by
Inglefield
.
I inquired what this man had left
behind, and found that it consisted of a
square box, put together by himself with
uncommon strength, but of rugged
workmanship
.
She proceeded to mention
that she had advised her brother, Mr.
Inglefield, to break open this box and
ascertain its contents, but this he did not
think himself justified in doing. Clithero
was guilty of no known crime, was
responsible
to no one for his actions, and might
sometime return to claim his property.
This box contained nothing with which
others had a right to meddle. Somewhat
might be found in it, throwing light upon
his past or present situation, but curiosity
was not to be gratified by these means.
What Clithero thought proper to conceal,
it was criminal for us to extort from him.
The house-keeper was by no means
convinced by these arguments, and at
length, obtained her brother's permission
to try whether any of her own keys would
unlock this chest. The keys were
produced
,
but no lock nor key-hole were
discoverable. The lid was fast, but by
what means it was fastened, the most
accurate
inspection could not detect. Hence
she was compelled to lay aside her
project
.
This chest had always stood in the
chamber which I now occupied.
These incidents were now
remembered
,
and I felt disposed to profit by this
opportunity of examining this box. It
stood in a corner, and was easily
distinguished
by its form. I lifted it and
found its weight by no means
extraordinary
.
Its structure was remarkable.
It consisted of six sides, square and of
similar dimensions. These were joined,
not by mortice and tennon; not by nails,
not by hinges, but the junction was
accurate
.
The means by which they were
made to cohere were invisible.
Appearances on every side were
uniform
,
nor were there any marks by which
the lid was distinguishable from its other
surfaces.
During his residence with Inglefield,
many specimens of mechanical ingenuity
were given by his servant. This was
the workmanship of his own hands. I
looked at it, for some time, till the desire
insensibly arose of opening and
examining
its contents.
I had no more right to do this than the
Inglefields, perhaps indeed this curiosity
was more absurd, and the gratification
more culpable in me than in them. I was
acquainted with the history of Clithero's
past life, and with his present condition.
Respecting these, I had no new
intelligence
to gain, and no doubts to solve.
What excuse could I make to the
proprietor
,
should he ever reappear to claim
his own, or to Inglefield for breaking
open a receptacle which all the maxims
of society combine to render sacred.
But could not my end be gained
without
violence. The means of opening
might present themselves on a patient
scrutiny. The lid might be raised and shut
down again without any tokens of my
act; its contents might be examined, and
all things restored to their former
condition
in a few minutes.
I intended not a theft. I intended to
benefit myself without inflicting injury
on others. Nay, might not the
discoveries
I should make, throw light upon
the conduct of this extraordinary man,
which his own narrative had withheld?
Was there reason to confide implicitly
on the tale which I had heard.
In spite of the testimony of my own
feelings, the miseries of Clithero appeared
in some degree, phantastic and
groundless
.
A thousand conceivable motives
might induce him to pervert or conceal
the truth. If he were thoroughly known,
his character might assume a new
appearance
,
and what is now so difficult to
reconcile
to common maxims, might prove
perfectly consistent with them. I desire
to restore him to peace, but a thorough
knowledge of his actions is necessary, both
to shew that he is worthy of compassion,
and to suggest the best means of
extirpating
his errors. It was possible that
this box contained the means of this
knowledge.
There were likewise other motives
which, as they possessed some influence,
however small, deserve to be mentioned.
Thou knowest that I also am a mechanist.
I had constructed a writing desk and
cabinet, in which I had endeavoured to
combine the properties of secrecy,
security
,
and strength, in the highest possible
degree. I looked upon this therefore
with the eye of an artist, and was
solicitous
to know the principles on which it
was formed. I determined to examine,
and if possible to open it.
EDGAR HUNTLY;
CHAPTER XII.
I surveyed
it with the
utmost
attention. All its parts appeared
equally solid and smooth. It could not
be doubted that one of its sides served
the purpose of a lid, and was possible to
be raised. Mere strength could not be
applied to raise it, because there was no
projecture which might be firmly held
by the hand, and by which force could
be exerted. Some spring, therefore,
secretly existed which might forever
elude the senses, but on which the hand,
by being moved over it, in all directions,
might accidentally light.
This process was effectual. A touch,
casually applied at an angle, drove back
a bolt, and a spring, at the same time, was
set in action, by which the lid was raised
above half an inch. No event could be
supposed more fortuitous than this. An
hundred hands might have sought in
vain for this spring. The spot in which
a certain degree of pressure was
sufficient
to produce this effect, was of all, the
last likely to attract notice or awaken
suspicion
.
I opened the trunk with eagerness.
The space within was divided into
numerous
compartments, none of which
contained
any thing of moment. Tools of
different and curious constructions, and
remnants of minute machinery, were all
that offered themselves to my notice.
My expectations being thus
frustrated
,
I proceeded to restore things to
their former state. I attempted to close
VOL. II. C
the lid; but the spring which had raised
it refused to bend. No measure that I
could adopt, enabled me to place the lid
in the same situation in which I had
found it. In my efforts to press down
the lid, which were augmented in
proportion
to the resistance that I met with,
the spring was broken. This obstacle
being removed, the lid resumed its proper
place; but no means, within the reach of
my ingenuity to discover, enabled me to
push forward the bolt, and thus to restore
the fastening.
I now perceived that Clithero had
provided not only against the opening
of his cabinet, but likewise against the
possibility of concealing that it had been
opened. This discovery threw me into
some confusion. I had been tempted
thus far, by the belief that my action
was without witnesses, and might be
forever
concealed. This opinion was now
confuted. If Clithero should ever
reclaim
his property, he would not fail to
detect the violence of which I had been
guilty. Inglefield would disapprove in
another what he had not permitted to
himself, and the unauthorized and
clandestine
manner in which I had behaved,
would aggravate, in his eyes, the
heinousness
of my offence.
But now there was no remedy. All
that remained was to hinder suspicion
from lighting on the innocent, and to
confess, to my friend, the offence which
I had committed. Meanwhile my first
project was resumed, and, the family
being now wrapt in profound sleep, I left
my chamber, and proceeded to the elm.
The moon was extremely brilliant, but I
hoped that this unfrequented road and
unseasonable hour would hinder me from
being observed. My chamber was above
the kitchen, with which it communicated
by a small stair-case, and the building to
which it belonged was connected with
the dwelling by a gallery. I extinguished
the light, and left it in the kitchen,
intending
to relight it, by the embers that
still glowed on the hearth, on my return.
I began to remove the sod, and cast
out the earth, with little confidence in the
success of my project. The issue of my
examination of the box humbled and
disheartened me. For some time I found
nothing that tended to invigorate my
hopes. I determined, however, to
descend
,
as long as the unsettled condition
of the earth shewed me that some one
had preceded me. Small masses of
stone were occasionally met with, which
served only to perplex me with
groundless
expectations. At length my spade
struck upon something which emitted a
very different sound. I quickly drew
it forth, and found it to be wood. Its
regular form, and the crevices which were
faintly discernible, persuaded me that it
was human workmanship, and that there
was a cavity within. The place in which
it was found, easily suggested some
connection
between this and the destiny of
Clithero. Covering up the hole with
speed, I hastened with my prize to the
house. The door, by which the kitchen
was entered, was not to be seen from the
road. It opened on a field, the farther
limit of which was a ledge of rocks, which
formed, on this side, the boundary of
Inglefield's estate and the westernmost
barrier of Norwalk.
As I turned the angle of the house,
and came in view of this door, methought
I saw a figure issue from it. I was startled
at this incident, and, stopping, crouched
close to the wall, that I might not be
discovered
.
As soon as the figure passed
VOL. II. C 2
beyond the verge of the shade, it was
easily distinguished to be that of
Clithero
!
He crossed the field with a rapid
pace, and quickly passed beyond the
reach of my eye.
This appearance was mysterious.
For what end he should visit this
habitation
,
could not be guessed. Was the
contingency to be lamented, in
consequence
of which an interview had been
avoided? Would it have compelled me
to explain the broken condition of his
trunk? I knew not whether to rejoice
at having avoided this interview, or to
deplore it.
These thoughts did not divert me
from examining the nature of the prize
which I had gained. I relighted my
candle and hied once more to the
chamber
.
The first object, which, on entering
it, atracted my attention, was the cabinet
broken into twenty fragments, on the
hearth. I had left it on a low table, at
a distant corner of the room.
No conclusion could be formed, but
that Clithero had been here, had
discovered
the violence which had been
committed
on his property, and, in the first
transport of his indignation, had shattered
it to pieces. I shuddered on reflecting
how near I had been to being detected
by him in the very act, and by how
small an interval I had escaped that
resentment, which, in that case, would
have probably been wreaked upon me.
My attention was withdrawn, at length,
from this object, and fixed upon the
contents of the box which I had dug up.
This was equally inaccessible with the
other. I had not the same motives for
caution and forbearance. I was
somewhat
desperate, as the consequences of my
indiscretion could not be aggravated, and
my curiosity was more impetuous, with
regard to the smaller than to the larger
cabinet. I placed it on the ground and
crushed it to pieces with my heel.
Something was within. I brought it
to the light, and, after loosing numerous
folds, at length drew forth a volume.
No object, in the circle of nature, was
more adapted than this, to rouse up all my
faculties. My feelings were anew
excited
on observing that it was a manuscript.
I bolted the door, and, drawing near the
light, opened and began to read.
A few pages was sufficent to explain
the nature of the work. Clithero had
mentioned that his lady had composed
a vindication of her conduct towards her
brother, when her intercession in his
favour was solicited and refused. This
performance had never been published,
but had been read by many, and was
preserved by her friends as a precious
monument of her genius and her virtue.
This manuscript was now before me.
That Clithero should preserve this
manuscript, amidst the wreck of his
hopes and fortunes, was apparently
conformable
to his temper. That, having
formed the resolution to die, he should
seek to hide this volume from the profane
curiosity of survivors, was a natural
proceeding
.
To bury it rather than to burn,
or disperse it into fragments, would be
suggested by the wish to conceal, without
committing what his heated fancy would
regard as sacrilege. To bury it beneath
the elm, was dictated by no fortuitous or
inexplicable caprice. This event could
scarcely fail of exercising some influence
on the perturbations of his sleep, and
thus, in addition to other causes, might
his hovering near this trunk, and
throwing up this earth, in the intervals
of slumber, be accounted for. Clithero,
indeed, had not mentioned this
proceeding
in the course of his narrative;
but that would have contravened the end
for which he had provided a grave for
this book.
I read this copious tale with
unspeakable
eagerness. It essentially agreed
with that which had been told by Clithero.
By drawing forth events into all their
circumstances, more distinct impressions
were produced on the mind, and proofs
of fortitude and equanimity were here
given, to which I had hitherto known no
parallel. No wonder that a soul like
Clithero's, pervaded by these proofs of
inimitable excellence, and thrillingly alive
to the passion of virtuous fame, and the
value of that existence which he had
destroyed, should be overborne by horror
at the view of the past.
The instability of life and happiness
was forcibly illustrated, as well as the
perniciousness of error. Exempt as this
lady was from almost every defect, she
was indebted for her ruin to absurd
opinions
of the sacredness of consanguinity,
to her anxiety for the preservation of a
ruffian, because that ruffian was her
brother. The spirit of Clithero was
enlightened and erect, but he weakly
suffered the dictates of eternal justice to
be swallowed up by gratitude. The
dread of unjust upbraiding hurried him
to murder and to suicide, and the
imputation
of imaginary guilt, impelled him
to the perpetration of genuine and
enormous
crimes.
The perusal of this volume ended
not but with the night. Contrary to my
hopes, the next day was stormy and wet.
This did not deter me from visiting the
mountain. Slippery paths and muddy
torrents were no obstacles to the purposes
which I had adopted. I wrapt myself,
and a bag of provisions, in a cloak of
painted canvass and speeded to the
dwelling
of Clithero.
I passed through the cave and reached
the bridge which my own ingenuity had
formed. At that moment, torrents of rain
poured from above, and stronger blasts
thundered amidst these desolate
recesses
and profound chasms. Instead of
lamenting the prevalence of this tempest,
I now began to regard it with pleasure.
It conferred new forms of sublimity and
grandeur on this scene.
As I crept with hands and feet, along
my imperfect bridge, a sudden gust had
nearly whirled me into the frightful abyss
below. To preserve myself, I was
oblidged to loose my hold of my burthen
and it fell into the gulf. This incident
disconcerted and distressed me. As soon
as I had effected my dangerous passage, I
screened myself behind a cliff, and gave
myself up to reflection.
The purpose of this arduous journey
was defeated, by the loss of the
provisions
I had brought. I despaired of
winning the attention of the fugitive to
supplications, or arguments tending to
smother remorse, or revive his fortitude.
The scope of my efforts was to consist
in vanquishing his aversion to food; but
these efforts would now be useless, since
I had no power to supply his cravings.
This deficiency, however, was easily
supplied. I had only to return home
and supply myself anew. No time was
to be lost in doing this; but I was willing
to remain under this shelter, till the fury
of the tempest had subsided. Besides,
I was not certain that Clithero had again
retreated hither. It was requisite to
explore the summit of this hill, and
ascertain
whether it had any inhabitant. I
VOL. II. D
might likewise discover what had been
the success of my former experiment,
and whether the food, which had been
left here on the former day, was consumed
or neglected.
While occupied with these
reflections
,
my eyes were fixed upon the
opposite
steeps. The tops of the trees, waving
to and fro, in the wildest commotion, and
their trunks, occasionally bending to the
blast, which, in these lofty regions, blew
with a violence unknown in the tracts
below, exhibited an awful spectacle. At
length, my attention was attracted by the
trunk which lay across the gulf, and
which I had converted into a bridge. I
perceived that it had already somewhat
swerved from its original position, that
every blast broke or loosened some of
the fibres by which its root was connected
with the opposite bank, and that, if the
storm did not speedily abate, there was
imminent danger of its being torn from
the rock and precipitated into the chasm.
Thus my retreat would be cut off, and
the evils, from which I was endeavouring
to rescue another, would be experienced
by myself.
I did not just then reflect that Clithero
had found access to this hill by other
means, and that the avenue by which he
came, would be equally commodious
to me. I believed my destiny to hang
upon the expedition with which I should
re-cross this gulf. The moments that
were spent in these deliberations were
critical, and I shuddered to observe that
the trunk was held in its place by one or
two fibres which were already stretched
almost to breaking.
To pass along the trunk, rendered
slippery by the wet, and unsteadfast by
the wind, was eminently dangerous. To
maintain my hold, in passing, in defiance
of the whirlwind, required the most
vigorous exertions. For this end it was
necessary to discommode myself of my
cloak, and of the volume, which I carried
in the pocket of my cloak. I believed
there was no reason to dread their being
destroyed or purloined, if left, for a few
hours or a day, in this recess. If laid
beside a stone, under shelter of this cliff,
they would, no doubt, remain unmolested
till the disappearance of the storm should
permit me to revisit this spot in the
afternoon
or on the morrow.
Just as I had disposed of these
incumbrances
,
and had risen from my seat,
my attention was again called to the
opposite steep, by the most unwelcome
object that, at this time, could possibly
occur. Something was perceived moving
among the bushes and rocks, which, for
a time, I hoped was no more than a
racoon or oppossum; but which presently
appeared to be a panther. His grey
coat, extended claws, fiery eyes, and a
cry which he at that moment uttered, and
which, by its resemblance to the human
voice, is peculiarly terrific, denoted him
to be the most ferocious and untamable
of that detested race
*
*
The grey Cougar.
This animal has all the essential
characteristics
of a tyger. Though somewhat inferior in size and
strength, these are such as to make him equally formidable to
man
.
The industry of our hunters has
nearly banished animals of prey from
these precincts. The fastnesses of
Norwalk, however, could not but afford
refuge to some of them. Of late I had
met them so rarely, that my fears were
seldom alive, and I trod, without
caution
,
the ruggedest and most solitary
haunts. Still, however, I had seldom
been unfurnished in my rambles with the
means of defence,
VOL. II. D 2
My temper never delighted in
carnage
and blood. I found no pleasure
in plunging into bogs, wading through
rivulets, and penetrating thickets, for
the sake of dispatching wood-cocks and
squirrels. To watch their gambols and
flittings, and invite them to my hand,
was my darling amusement when
loitering
among the woods and the rocks.
It was much otherwise, however, with
regard to rattlesnakes and panthers.
These I thought it no breach of duty
to exterminate wherever they could be
found. These judicious and sanguinary
spoilers were equally the enemies of man
and of the harmless race that sported in
the trees, and many of their skins are
still preserved by me as trophies of my
juvenile prowess.
As hunting was never my trade or
my sport, I never loaded myself with
fowling-piece or rifle. Assiduous
exercise
had made me master of a weapon
of much easier carriage, and, within a
moderate distance, more destructive and
unerring. This was the Tom-hawk.
With this I have often severed an oak
branch and cut the sinews of a
cato'mountain
,
at the distance of sixty feet.
The unfrequency with which I had
lately encountered this foe, and the
incumbrance of provision, made me
neglect, on this occasion, to bring with
me my usual arms. The beast that was
now before me, when stimulated by
hunger
,
was accustomed to assail whatever
could provide him with a banquet of
blood. He would set upon the man
and the deer with equal and irresistible
ferocity. His sagacity was equal to his
strength, and he seemed able to discover
when his antagonist was armed and
prepared for defence.
My past experience enabled me to
estimate the full extent of my danger.
He sat on the brow of the steep, eyeing
the bridge, and apparently deliberating
whether he should cross it. It was
probable
that he had scented my foot-steps
thus far, and should he pass over, his
vigilance could scarcely fail of detecting
my assylum. The pit into which Clithero
had sunk from my view was at some
distance. To reach it was the first
impulse
of my fear, but this could not be
done without exciting the observation
and pursuit of this enemy. I deeply
regretted the untoward chance that had
led me, when I first came over, to a
different
shelter.
Should he retain his present station,
my danger was scarcely lessened. To
pass over in the face of a famished tyger
was only to rush upon my fate. The
falling of the trunk, which had lately
been so anxiously deprecated, was now,
with no less solicitude, desired. Every
new gust, I hoped, would tear asunder
its remaining bands, and, by cutting off
all communication between the opposite
steeps, place me in security.
My hopes, however, were destined to
be frustrated. The fibres of the prostrate
tree, were obstinately tenacious of their
hold, and presently the animal scrambled
down the rock and proceeded to cross it.
Of all kinds of death, that which now
menaced me was the most abhorred. To
die by disease, or by the hand of a
fellow-creature
,
was propitious and lenient in
comparison with being rent to pieces by
the fangs of this savage. To perish, in
this obscure retreat, by means so
impervious
to the anxious curiosity of my
friends, to lose my portion of existence
by so untoward and ignoble a destiny,
was insupportable. I bitterly deplored
my rashness in coming hither
unprovided
for an encounter like this.
The evil of my present circumstances
consisted chiefly in suspense. My death
was unavoidable, but my imagination
had leisure to torment itself by
anticipations
.
One foot of the savage was slowly
and cautiously moved after the other.
He struck his claws so deeply into the
bark that they were with difficulty
withdrawn
.
At length he leaped upon the
ground. We were now separated by an
interval of scarcely eight feet. To leave
the spot where I crouched, was
impossible
.
Behind and beside me, the cliff
rose perpendicularly, and before me was
this grim and terrific visage. I shrunk
still closer to the ground and closed my
eyes.
From this pause of horror I was
roused by the noise occasioned by a
second spring of the animal. He leaped
into the pit, in which I had so deeply
regretted that I had not taken refuge,
and disappeared. My rescue was so
sudden
,
and so much beyond my belief or
my hope, that I doubted, for a moment,
whether my senses did not deceive me.
This opportunity of escape was not to be
neglected. I left my place, and
scrambled
over the trunk with a precipitation
which had liked to have proved fatal.
The tree groaned and shook under me,
the wind blew with unexampled violence,
and I had scarcely reached the opposite
steep when the roots were severed from
the rock and the whole fell thundering
to the bottom of the chasm.
My trepidations were not speedily
quieted. I looked back with wonder on
my hair-breadth escape, and on that
singular concurrence of events, which
had placed me, in so short a period, in
absolute security. Had the trunk fallen
a moment earlier, I should have been
imprisoned on the hill or thrown
head-long
.
Had its fall been delayed another
moment I should have been pursued; for
the beast now issued from his den, and
testified his surprise and disappointment
by tokens the sight of which made my
blood run cold.
He saw me, and hastened to the verge
of the chasm. He squatted on his
hindlegs
and assumed the attitude of one
preparing to leap. My consternation was
excited afresh by these appearances. It
seemed at first as if the rift was too wide
for any power of muscles to carry him
in safety over; but I knew the
unparalleled
agility of this animal, and that his
experience had made him a better judge
of the practicability of this exploit than
I was.
Still there was hope that he would
relinquish this design as desperate. This
hope was quickly at an end. He sprung,
and his fore-legs touched the verge of
the rock on which I stood. In spite of
vehement exertions, however, the surface
was too smooth and too hard to allow
him to make good his hold. He fell, and
a piercing cry, uttered below, shewed that
nothing had obstructed his descent to the
bottom.
Thus was I again rescued from
death. Nothing but the pressure of
famine could have prompted this savage
to so audacious and hazardous an effort;
but, by yeilding to this impulse, he had
made my future visits to this spot exempt
from peril. Clithero was, likewise,
relieved from a danger that was
imminent
and unforeseen. Prowling over
these grounds the panther could scarcely
have failed to meet with this solitary
fugitive.
VOL. II. E
Had the animal lived, my first duty
would have been to have sought him
out, and assailed him with my
Tomhawk
;
but no undertaking would have
been more hazardous. Lurking in the
grass, or in the branches of a tree, his
eye might have descried my approach,
he might leap upon me unperceived, and
my weapon would be useless.
With an heart beating with unwonted
rapidity, I once more descended the
cliff, entered the cavern, and arrived at
Huntly farm, drenched with rain, and
exhausted by fatigue.
By night the storm was dispelled;
but my exhausted strength would not
allow me to return to the mountain.
At the customary hour I retired to my
chamber. I incessantly ruminated on
the adventures of the last day, and
inquired into the conduct which I was
next to pursue.
The bridge being destroyed, my
customary
access was cut off. There was no
possibility of restoring this bridge. My
strength would not suffice to drag a fallen
tree from a distance, and there was none
whose position would abridge or
supersede
that labour. Some other expedient
must, therefore, be discovered to pass
this chasm.
I reviewed the circumstances of my
subterranean journey. The cavern was
imperfectly explored. Its branches might
be numerous. That which I had hitherto
pursued, terminated in an opening at a
considerable distance from the bottom.
Other branches might exist, some of
which might lead to the foot of the
precipice, and thence a communication
might be found with the summit of the
interior hill.
The danger of wandering into dark
and untried paths, and the
commodiousness
of that road which had at first
been taken, were sufficient reasons for
having hitherto suspended my
examination
of the different branches of this
labyrinth. Now my customary road was
no longer practicable, and another was
to be carefully explored. For this end,
on my next journey to the mountain, I
determined to take with me a lamp, and
unravel this darksome maze: This
project
I resolved to execute the next day.
I now recollected what, if it had more
seasonably occurred, would have taught
me caution. Some months before this a
farmer, living in the skirts of Norwalk,
discovered two marauders in his field,
whom he imagined to be a male and
female panther. They had destroyed
some sheep, and had been hunted by the
farmer, with long and fruitless diligence.
Sheep had likewise been destroyed in
different quarters; but the owners had
fixed the imputation of the crime upon
dogs, many of whom had atoned for
their supposed offences by their death.
He who had mentioned his discovery of
panthers, received little credit from his
neighbours; because a long time had
elapsed since these animals were
supposed
to have been exiled from this
district, and because no other person
had seen them. The truth of this
seemed now to be confirmed by the
testimony
of my own senses; but, if the
rumour were true, there still existed
another of these animals, who might
harbour in the obscurities of this desert,
and against whom it was necessary to
employ some precaution. Henceforth
I resolved never to traverse the
wilderness
unfurnished with my tom-hawk.
VOL. II. E 2
These images, mingled with those
which the contemplation of futurity
suggested
,
floated, for a time, in my brain;
but at length gave place to sleep.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XIII.
Since
my return home, my mind
had been fully occupied by schemes and
reflections relative to Clithero. The
project suggested by thee, and to which
I had determined to devote my leisure,
was forgotten, or remembered for a
moment and at wide intervals. What,
however, was nearly banished from my
waking thoughts, occurred, in an
incongruous
and half-seen form, to my dreams.
During my sleep, the image of
Waldegrave
flitted before me. Methought
the sentiment that impelled him to visit
me, was not affection or complacensy, but
inquietude and anger. Some service or
duty remained to be performed by me,
which I had culpably neglected: to
inspirit
my zeal, to awaken my remembrance,
and incite me to the performance of this
duty, did this glimmering messenger,
this half indignant apparition, come.
I commonly awake soon enough to
mark the youngest dawn of the morning.
Now, in consequence perhaps of my
perturbed sleep, I opened my eyes before
the stars had lost any of their lustre.
This circumstance produced some
surprise
,
until the images that lately hovered
in my fancy, were recalled, and furnished
somewhat like a solution of the problem.
Connected with the image of my dead
friend, was that of his sister. The
discourse that took place at our last
interview
;
the scheme of transcribing, for
thy use, all the letters which, during
his short but busy life, I received from
him; the nature of this correspondence,
and the opportunity which this
employment
would afford me of contemplating
these ample and precious monuments
of the intellectual existence and moral
pre-eminence of my friend, occurred to
my thoughts.
The resolution to prosecute the task
was revived. The obligation of
benevolence
,
with regard to Clithero, was not
discharged. This, neither duty nor
curiosity would permit to be overlooked
or delayed; but why should my whole
attention and activity be devoted to this
man. The hours which were spent at
home and in my chamber, could not be
more usefully employed than in making
my intended copy.
In a few hours after sun-rise I
purposed
to resume my way to the mountain.
Could this interval be appropriated to a
better purpose than in counting over my
friend's letters, setting them apart from
my own, and preparing them for that
transcription from which I expected so
high and yet so mournful a gratification.
This purpose, by no violent union,
was blended with the recollection of my
dream. This recollection infused some
degree of wavering and dejection into
my mind. In transcribing these letters
I should violate pathetic and solemn
injunctions frequently repeated by the
writer. Was there some connection
between this purpose and the incidents
of my vision. Was the latter sent to
enforce the interdictions which had been
formerly imposed?
Thou art not fully acquainted with
the intellectual history of thy brother.
Some information on that head will be
necessary to explain the nature of that
reluctance which I now feel to comply
with thy request, and which had
formerly
so much excited thy surprise.
Waldegrave, like other men, early
devoted to meditation and books, had
adopted, at different periods, different
systems of opinion, on topics connected
with religion and morals. His earliest
creeds, tended to efface the impressions
of his education; to deify necessity
and universalize matter; to destroy the
popular distinctions between soul and
body, and to dissolve the supposed
connection between the moral condition
of man, anterior and subsequent to
death.
This creed he adopted with all the
fulness of conviction, and propagated
with the utmost zeal. Soon after our
friendship commenced, fortune placed us
at a distance from each other, and no
intercourse was allowed but by the pen.
Our letters, however, were punctual and
copious. Those of Waldegrave were
too frequently devoted to the defence
of his favourite tenets.
Thou art acquainted with the
revolution
that afterwards took place in his
mind. Placed within the sphere of
religious
influence, and listening daily to
the reasonings and exhortations of Mr.
S..., whose benign temper and
blameless
deportment was a visible and
constant
lesson, he insensibly resumed the
faith which he had relinquished, and
became the vehement opponent of all
that he had formerly defended. The
chief object of his labours, in this new
state of his mind, was to counteract the
effect of his former reasonings on my
opinions.
At this time, other changes took
place in his situation, in consequence of
which we were once more permitted to
reside under the same roof. The
intercourse
now ceased to be by letter, and
the subtle and laborious argumentations
which he had formerly produced against
religion, and which were contained in a
permanent form, were combatted in
transient
conversation. He was not only
eager to subvert those opinions, which
he had contributed to instil into me, but
was anxious that the letters and
manuscripts
,
which had been employed in
their support, should be destroyed. He
did not fear wholly or chiefly on my
own account. He believed that the
influence of former reasonings on my
faith would be sufficiently eradicated by
the new; but he dreaded lest these
manuscripts might fall into other hands,
and thus produce mischiefs which it
would not be in his power to repair.
With regard to me, the poison had been
followed by its antidote; but with
respect
to others, these letters would
communicate
VOL. II. F
the poison when the antidote
could not be administered.
I would not consent to this sacrifice.
I did not entirely abjure the creed
which had, with great copiousness and
eloquence, been defended in these
letters
.
Beside, mixed up with abstract
reasonings, were numberless passages
which elucidated the character and
history
of my friend. These were too
precious to be consigned to oblivion, and
to take them out of their present
connection
and arrangement, would be to
mutilate and deform them.
His intreaties and remonstrances
were earnest and frequent, but always
ineffectual. He had too much purity of
motives to be angry at my stubbornness,
but his sense of the mischievous
tendency
of these letters, was so great, that
my intractability cost him many a pang.
He was now gone, and I had not
only determined to preserve these
monuments
,
but had consented to copy them
for the use of another: for the use of one
whose present and eternal welfare had
been the chief object of his cares and
efforts. Thou, like others of thy sex,
art unaccustomed to metaphysical
refinements
.
Thy religion is the growth
of sensibility and not of argument. Thou
art not fortified and prepossessed against
the subtleties, with which the being and
attributes of the deity have been assailed.
Would it be just to expose thee to
pollution
and depravity from this source? To
make thy brother the instrument of thy
apostacy, the author of thy fall? That
brother, whose latter days were so
ardently
devoted to cherishing the spirit
of devotion in thy heart?
These ideas now occurred with more
force than formerly. I had promised,
not without reluctance, to give thee the
entire copy of his letters; but I now
receded from this promise. I resolved
merely to select for thy perusal such
as were narrative or descriptive. This
could not be done with too much
expedition
.
It was still dark, but my sleep
was at an end, and, by a common
apparatus
,
that lay beside my bed, I could
instantly produce a light.
The light was produced, and I
proceeded
to the cabinet where all my
papers and books are deposited. This
was my own contrivance and
workmanship
,
undertaken by the advice of
Sarsefield
,
who took infinite pains to foster
that mechanical genius, which displayed
itself so early and so forcibly in thy
friend. The key belonging to this, was,
like the cabinet itself, of singular
structure
.
For greater safety, it was
constantly
placed in a closet, which was
likewise locked.
The key was found as usual, and the
cabinet opened. The letters were bound
together in a compact form, lodged in
a parchment case, and placed in a secret
drawer. This drawer would not have
been detected by common eyes, and it
opened by the motion of a spring, of
whose existence none but the maker
was conscious. This drawer I had
opened before I went to sleep and the
letters were then safe.
Thou canst not imagine my
confusion
and astonishment, when, on opening
the drawer, I perceived that the pacquet
was gone. I looked with more attention,
and put my hand within it, but the space
was empty. Whither had it gone, and
by whom was it purloined? I was not
conscious of having taken it away, yet
no hands but mine could have done it.
VOL. II. E 2
On the last evening I had doubtless
removed it to some other corner, but
had forgotten it. I tasked my
understanding
and my memory. I could not
conceive the possibility of any motives
inducing me to alter my arrangements
in this respect, and was unable to
recollect
that I had made this change
What remained? This invaluable
relique had disappeared. Every thought
and every effort must be devoted to the
single purpose of regaining it. As yet I
did not despair. Until I had opened
and ransacked every part of the cabinet
in vain, I did not admit the belief that
I had lost it. Even then this persuasion
was tumultuous and fluctuating. It had
vanished to my senses, but these senses
were abused and depraved. To have
passed, of its own accord, through the
pores of this wood, was impossible; but
if it were gone, thus did it escape.
I was lost in horror and amazement.
I explored every nook a second and a
third time, but still it eluded my eye and
my touch. I opened my closets and
cases. I pryed every where, unfolded
every article of cloathing, turned and
scrutinized
every instrument and tool, but
nothing availed.
My thoughts were not speedily
collected
or calmed. I threw myself on
the bed and resigned myself to musing.
That my loss was irretreivable, was a
supposition not to be endured. Yet
ominous
terrors haunted me. A whispering
intimation that a relique which I valued
more than life was torn forever away by
some malignant and inscrutable destiny.
The same power that had taken it from
this receptacle, was able to waft it over
the ocean or the mountains, and condemn
me to a fruitless and eternal search.
But what was he that committed the
theft? Thou only, of the beings who
live, wast acquainted with the existence
of these manuscripts. Thou art many
miles distant, and art utterly a stranger
to the mode or place of their
concealment
.
Not only access to the cabinet,
but access to the room, without my
knowledge
and permission, was impossible.
Both were locked during this night.
Not five hours had elapsed since the
cabinet and drawer had been opened, and
since the letters had been seen and
touched, being in their ordinary position.
During this interval, the thief had
entered
,
and despoiled me of my treasure.
This event, so inexplicable and so
dreadful, threw my soul into a kind of
stupor or distraction, from which I was
suddenly roused by a foot-step, softly
moving in the entry near my door. I
started from my bed, as if I had gained
a glimpse of the robber. Before I could
run to the door, some one knocked. I
did not think upon the propriety of
answering the signal, but hastened with
tremulous fingers and throbbing heart
to open the door. My uncle, in his
night-dress, and apparently just risen
from his bed, stood before me!
He marked the eagerness and
perturbation
of my looks, and inquired into
the cause. I did not answer his
inquiries
.
His appearance in my chamber
and in this guise, added to my surprise.
My mind was full of the late discovery,
and instantly conceived some connection
between this unseasonable visit and my
lost manuscript. I interrogated him in
my turn as to the cause of his coming.
Why, said he, I came to ascertain
whether it was you or not who amused
himself so strangely at this time of night.
What is the matter with you? Why are
you up so early?
I told him that I had been roused by
my dreams, and finding no inclination
to court my slumber back again, I had
risen, though earlier by some hours than
the usual period of my rising.
But why did you go up stairs? You
might easily imagine that the sound of
your steps would alarm those below,
who would be puzzled to guess who it
was that had thought proper to amuse
himself in this manner.
Up stairs? I have not left my room
this night. It is not ten minutes since I
awoke, and my door has not since been
opened.
Indeed! That is strange. Nay, it
is impossible. It was your feet surely
that I heard pacing so solemnly and
indefatigably across the
long-room
for
near an hour. I could not for my life
conjecture, for a time, who it was, but
finally concluded that it was you. There
was still, however, some doubt, and I
came hither to satisfy myself.
These tidings were adapted to raise
all my emotions to a still higher pitch.
I questioned him with eagerness as to the
circumstances he had noticed. He said
he had been roused by a sound, whose
power of disturbing him arose, not from
its loudness, but from its uncommonness.
He distinctly heard some one pacing to
and fro with bare feet, in the long room:
This sound continued, with little
intermission
,
for an hour. He then noticed
a cessation of the walking, and a sound
as if some one were lifting the lid of the
large cedar chest, that stood in the corner
of this room. The walking was not
resumed, and all was silent. He listened
for a quarter of an hour, and busied
himself in conjecturing the cause of this
disturbance. The most probable
conclusion
was, that the walker was his
nephew, and his curiosity had led him
to my chamber to ascertain the truth.
This dwelling has three stories. The
two lower stories are divided into
numerous
apartments. The upper story
constitutes
a single room whose sides are the
four walls of the house, and whose
ceiling is the roof. This room is
unocupied
,
except by lumber, and imperfectly
lighted by a small casement at one end.
In this room, were foot-steps heard by my
uncle.
The stair-case leading to it
terminated
in a passage near my door. I snatched
the candle, and desiring him to follow me,
added, that I would ascertain the truth
in a moment He followed, but observed
that the walking had ceased long enough
for the person to escape.
I ascended to the room, and looked
behind and among the tables, and chairs,
and casks, which, were confusedly
scattered
through it, but found nothing in
the shape of man. The cedar chest,
spoken of by Mr. Huntly, contained old
books, and remnants of maps and charts,
whose worthlessness unfitted them for
accommodation elsewhere. The lid was
without hinges or lock. I examined this
repository, but there was nothing which
attracted my attention.
The way between the kitchen door,
and the door of the long-room, had no
impediments. Both were usually
unfastened
but the motives by which any
stranger to the dwelling, or indeed any
one within it, could be prompted to
chuse this place and hour, for an
employ-of
this kind, were wholly
incomprehensible
.
VOL. II. G
When the family rose, inquiries were
made but no satisfaction was obtained.
The family consisted only of four
persons
,
my uncle, my two sisters, and myself.
I mentioned to them the loss I had
sustained
,
but their conjectures were no less
unsatisfactory on this than on the former
incident.
There was no end to my restless
meditations. Waldegrave was the only
being, beside myself, acquainted with
the secrets of my cabinet. During his
life these manuscripts had been the
objects of perpetual solicitude; to gain
possession, to destroy, or secrete them,
was the strongest of his wishes. Had he
retained his sensibility on the approach
of death, no doubt he would have
renewed
,
with irresistable solemnity, his
injunctions to destroy them.
Now, however, they had vanished.
There were no materials of conjecture;
no probabilities to be weighed, or
suspicions
to revolve. Human artifice or
power was unequal to this exploit.
Means less than preternatural would
not furnish a conveyance for this
treasure
.
It was otherwise with regard to this
unseasonable walker. His inducements
indeed were beyond my power to
conceive
,
but to enter these doors and ascend
these stairs, demanded not the faculties
of any being more than human.
This intrusion, and the pillage of my
cabinet were contemporary events. Was
there no more connection between them
than that which results from time? Was
not the purloiner of my treasure and the
wanderer the same person? I could not
reconcile the former incident with the
attributes of man, and yet a secret faith,
not to be outrooted or suspended, swayed
me, and compelled me to imagine that
the detection of this visitant, would
unveil the thief.
These thoughts were pregnant with
dejection and reverie. Clithero, during
the day, was forgotten. On the
succeeding
night, my intentions, with regard to
this man, returned. I derived some
slender
consolation from reflecting, that time,
in its long lapse and ceaseless
revolutions
,
might dissipate the gloom that
environed
me. Meanwhile I struggled to
dismiss the images connected with my
loss and to think only of Clithero.
My impatience was as strong as ever
to obtain another interview with this
man. I longed with vehemence for the
return of day. I believed that every
moment added to his sufferings,
intellectual
and physical, and confided in the
efficacy of my presence to alleviate or
suspend them. The provisions I had
left would be speedily consumed, and
the abstinence of three days was
sufficient
to undermine the vital energies.
I, some times, hesitated whether I ought
not instantly to depart. It was night
indeed, but the late storm had purified
the air, and the radiance of a full moon
was universal and dazling.
From this attempt I was deterred by
reflecting that my own frame needed
the repairs of sleep. Toil and
watchfulness
,
if prolonged another day, would
deeply injure a constitution by no means
distinguished for its force. I must,
therefore
,
compel, if it were possible, some
hours of repose. I prepared to retire to
bed, when a new incident occurred to
divert my attention for a time from these
designs.
VOL. II. G 2
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XIV.
While
sitting alone by the
parlour fire, marking the effects of
moonlight
,
I noted one on horseback coming
towards the gate. At first sight,
methought
his shape and guise were not
wholly new to me; but all that I
could discern was merely a resemblance
to some one whom I had before seen.
Presently he stopped, and, looking
towards
the house, made inquiries of
a passenger who chanced to be near.
Being apparently satisfied with the
answers
he received, he rode with a quick
pace, into the court and alighted at the
door. I started from my seat, and, going
forth, waited with some impatience to hear
his purpose explained.
He accosted me with the formality of
a stranger, and asked if a young man, by
name Edgar Huntly, resided here. Being
answered in the affirmative, and being
requested to come in, he entered, and
seated himself, without hesitation, by
the fire. Some doubt and anxiety were
visible in his looks. He seemed
desirous
of information upon some topic, and
yet betrayed terror lest the answers he
might receive should subvert some hope,
or confirm some foreboding,
Meanwhile I scrutinized his features
with much solicitude. A nearer and more
deliberate view convinced me that the
first impression was just; but still I was
unable to call up his name or the
circumstances
of our former meeting. The
pause was at length ended by his saying,
in a faltering voice:
My name is Weymouth. I came hither
to obtain information on a subject in
which my happiness is deeply
concerned
.
At the mention of his name, I started.
It was a name too closely connected with
the image of thy brother, not to call up
affecting and vivid recollections.
Weymouth
thou knowest, was thy brother's
friend. It is three years since this man
left America, during which time no
tidings had been heard of him, at least,
by thy brother. He had now returned,
and was probably unacquainted with the
fate of his friend.
After an anxious pause, he continued
....Since my arrival I have heard of an
event which has, on many accounts,
given me the deepest sorrow. I loved
Waldegrave, and know not any person in
the world whose life was dearer to me
than his. There were considerations,
however, which made it more precious
to me than the life of one whose merits
might be greater. With his life, my own
existence and property were, I have
reason
to think, inseparably united.
On my return to my country, after
a long absence, I made immediate
inquiries
after him. I was informed of his
untimely death. I had questions, of
infinite moment to my happiness, to decide
with regard to the state and disposition of
his property. I sought out those of his
friends who had maintained with him the
most frequent and confidential
intercourse
,
but they could not afford me any
satisfaction. At length, I was informed
that a young man of your name, and living
in this district, had enjoyed more of
his affection and society than any other,
had regulated the property which he left
behind, and was best qualified to afford
the intelligence which I sought. You, it
seems, are this person, and of you I must
make inquiries to which I conjure you to
return sincere and explicit answers.
That, said I, I shall find no
difficulty
in doing. Whatever questions you
shall think proper to ask, I will answer
with readiness and truth.
What kind of property and to what
amount was your friend possessed of at
his death?
It was money, and consisted of
deposits
at the bank of North America. The
amount was little short of eight thousand
dollars?
On whom has this property devolved?
His sister was his only kindred, and
she is now in possession of it?
Did he leave any will by which he
directed the disposition of his property?
While thus speaking, Weymouth fixed
his eyes upon my countenance, and
seemed anxious to pierce into my inmost
soul. I was somewhat surprised at his
questions, but much more at the manner
in which they were put. I answered
him, however, without delay...He left
no will, nor was any paper discovered, by
which we could guess at his intentions.
No doubt, indeed, had he made a will
his sister would have been placed
precisely
in the same condition in which she
now is. He was not only bound to her
by the strongest ties of kindred, but by
affection and gratitude.
Weymouth now withdrew his eyes
from my face, and sunk into a mournful
reverie. He sighed often and deeply.
This deportment and the strain of his
inquiries excited much surprise. His
interest in the fate of Waldegrave ought
to have made the information he had
received, a source of satisfaction rather
than of regret. The property which
Waldegrave left was much greater than
his mode of life, and his own professions
had given us reason to except, but it was
no more than sufficient to insure to thee
an adequate subsistence. It ascertained
the happiness of those who were dearest
to Waldegrave, and placed them forever
beyond the reach of that poverty which
had hitherto beset them. I made no
attempt to interrupt the silence, but
prepared
to answer any new interrogatory.
At length, Weymouth resumed:
Waldegrave was a fortunate man, to
amass so considerable a sum in so short
a time. I remember, when we parted,
he was poor. He used to lament that
his scrupulous integrity precluded him
from all the common roads to wealth.
He did not contemn riches, but he set
the highest value upon competence; and
imagined that he was doomed forever
to poverty. His religious duty
compelled
him to seek his livelihood by
teaching a school of blacks. The labour
was disproportioned to his feeble
constitution
,
and the profit was greatly
disproportioned
to the labour. It scarcely
supplied the necessities of nature, and
was reduced sometimes even below that
standard by his frequent indisposition.
I rejoice to find that his scruples had
somewhat relaxed their force, and that
he had betaken himself to some more
profitable occupation. Pray, what was
his new way of business?
Nay, said I, his scruples continued
as rigid, in this respect, as ever. He
was teacher of the Negro free-school
when he died.
Indeed! How then came he to
amass so much money? Could he blend
any more lucrative pursuit with his duty
as a school-master?
Vol. II H
So it seems.
What was his pursuit?
That question, I believe, none of his
friends are qualified to answer. I thought
myself acquainted with the most secret
transactions of his life, but this had been
carefully concealed from me. I was not
only unapprised of any other
employment
of his time, but had not the
slightest suspicion of his possessing any
property beside his clothes and books.
Ransacking his papers, with a different
view, I lighted on his bank-book, in
which was a regular receipt for seven
thousand five hundred dollars. By what
means he acquired this money, and even
the acquisition of it, till his death put us
in possession of his papers, was wholly
unknown to us.
Possibly he might have held it in
trust for another. In this case some
memorandums or letters would be found
explaining this affair.
True. This supposition could not
fail to occur, in consequence of which
the most diligent search was made among
his papers, but no shred or scrap was
to be found which countenanced our
conjecture.
You may reasonably be surprised,
and perhaps offended, said Weymouth, at
these inquiries; but it is time to explain
my motives for making them. Three
years ago I was, like Waldegrave,
indigent
,
and earned my bread by daily
labour. During seven years service in a
public office, I saved, from the
expences
of subsistence, a few hundred dollars.
I determined to strike into a new path,
and, with this sum, to lay the foundation
of better fortune. I turned it into a bulky
commodity, freighted and loaded a small
vessel, and went with it to Barcelona in
Spain. I was not unsuccessful in my
projects, and, changing my abode to
England, France and Germany, according
as my interest required, I became finally
possessed of sufficient for the supply of
all my wants. I then resolved to return
to my native country, and, laying out my
money in land, to spend the rest of my
days in the luxury and quiet of an
opulent
farmer. For this end I invested the
greatest part of my property in a cargo
of wine from Madeira. The remainder
I turned into a bill of exchange for
seven thousand five hundred dollars. I
had maintained a friendly
correspondence
with Waldegrave during my
absence
.
There was no one with whom
I had lived on terms of so much intimacy,
and had boundless confidence in his
integrity. To him therefore I determined
to transmit this bill, requesting him to
take the money into safe keeping until
my return. In this manner I endeavoured
to provide against the accidents that
might befall my person or my cargo in
crossing the ocean.
It was my fate to encounter the worst
of these disasters. We were overtaken
by a storm, my vessel was driven ashore
on the coast of Portugal, my cargo was
utterly lost, and the greater part of the
crew and passengers were drowned. I
was rescued from the same fate by some
fishermen. In consequence of the
hardships
to which I had been exposed,
having laboured for several days at the
pumps, and spent the greater part of a
winter night, hanging from the rigging
of the ship, and perpetually beaten by
the waves, I contracted a severe disease,
which bereaved me of the use of my
limbs. The fishermen who rescued me,
carried me to their huts, and there I
Vol. II. H 2
remained three weeks helpless and
miserable
.
That part of the coast on which I
was thrown, was, in the highest degree,
sterile and rude. Its few inhabitants
subsisted precariously on the produce of
the ocean. Their dwellings were of mud,
low, filthy, dark, and comfortless. Their
fuel was the stalks of shrubs, sparingly
scattered over a sandy desert. Their
poverty scarcely allowed them salt and
black bread with their fish, which was
obtained in unequal and sometimes
insufficient
quantities, and which they ate
with all its impurities and half cooked.
My former habits as well as my present
indisposition required very different
treatment
from what the ignorance and penury
of these people obliged them to bestow.
I lay upon the moist earth, imperfectly
sheltered from the sky, and with neither
raimentor fire to keep me warm. My hosts
had little attention or compassion to spare
to the wants of others. They could not
remove me to a more hospitable district,
and here, without doubt, I should have
perished had not a monk chanced to
visit their hovels. He belonged to a
convent of St. Jago, some leagues farther
from the shore, who used to send one of
its members annually to inspect the
religious concerns of those outcasts.
Happily this was the period of their
visitations
.
My abode in Spain had made me
somewhat conversant with its language.
The dialect of this monk did not so
much differ from Castilian, but that, with
the assistance of Latin, we were able to
converse. The jargon of the
fishermen
was unintelligible, and they had
vainly endeavoured to keep up my spirits
by informing me of this expected visit.
This monk was touched with
compassion
at my calamity, and speedily
provided the means of my removal to his
convent. Here I was charitably
entertained
,
and the aid of a physician was
procured
for me. He was but poorly skilled
in his profession, and rather confirmed
than alleviated my disease. The
Portuguese
of his trade, especially in remoter
districts, are little more than dealers in
talismans and nostrums. For a long
time I was unable to leave my pallet,
and had no prospect before me but that
of consuming my days in the gloom of
this cloister.
All the members of this convent, but
he who had been my first benefactor, and
whose name was Chaledro, were
bigotted
and sordid. Their chief motive for
treating me with kindness, was the hope
of obtaining a convert from heresy. They
spared no pains to subdue my errors,
and were willing to prolong my
imprisonment
,
in the hope of finally gaining
their end. Had my fate been governed
by those, I should have been immured in
this convent, and compelled, either to
adopt their fanatical creed or to put an
end to my own life, in order to escape
their well meant persecutions. Chaledro,
however, though no less sincere in his
faith and urgent in his intreaties, yet
finding me invincible, exerted his
influence
to obtain my liberty.
After many delays, and strenuous
exertions
of my friend, they consented to
remove me to Oporto. The journey was
to be performed in an open cart over a
mountainous country, in the heats of
summer
.
The monks endeavoured to
dissuade
me from the enterprize, for my own
sake, it being scarcely possible that one in
my feeble state, should survive a journey
like this; but I despaired of improving my
condition by other means. I preferred
death to the imprisonment of a
Portuguese
monastery, and knew that I could
hope for no alleviation of my disease, but
from the skill of Scottish or French
physicians
,
whom I expected to meet with in
that city. I adhered to my purpose with
so much vehemence and obstinacy, that
they finally yielded to my wishes.
My road lay through the wildest and
most rugged districts. It did not exceed
ninety miles, but seven days were
consumed
on the way. The motion of the
vehicle racked me with the keenest
pangs, and my attendants concluded
that every stage would be my last. They
had been selected without due regard to
their characters. They were knavish and
inhuman, and omitted nothing, but actual
violence, to hasten my death. They
purposely
retarded the journey, and
protracted
to seven, what might have been
readily performed in four days. They
neglected to execute the orders which
they had received, respecting my
lodging
and provisions, and from them, as
well as from the peasants, who were sure
to be informed that I was an heretic, I
suffered every species of insult and
injury. My constitution, as well as my
frame, possessed a fund of strength of
which I had no previous conception. In
spite of hardship and exposure and
abstinence
,
I, at last, arrived at Oporto.
Instead of being carried, agreeably
to Chaledro's direction, to a convent of
St. Jago, I was left, late in the evening,
in the porch of a common hospital. My
attendants, having laid me on the
pavement
and loaded me with imprecations,
left me to obtain admission by my own
efforts. I passed the live-long night
in this spot, and in the morning was
received into the house, in a state which
left it uncertain whether I was alive or
dead.
After recovering my sensibility, I
made various efforts to procure a visit
from some English merchant. This was
no easy undertaking for one in my
deplorable
condition. I was too weak to
articulate
my words distinctly, and these words
were rendered by my foreign accent,
scarcely intelligible. The likelihood of
my speedy death made the people about
me more indifferent to my wants and
petitions.
I will not dwell upon my repeated
disappointments, but content myself with
mentioning that I gained the attention
of a French gentleman, whose curiosity
brought him to view the hospital.
Through him, I obtained a visit from
an English merchant, and finally gained
the notice of a person, who formerly
resided in America, and of whom I had
imperfect knowledge. By their kindness
I was removed from the hospital to a
private house. A Scottish surgeon was
summoned to my assistance, and in seven
months, I was restored to my present
state of health.
At Oporto, I embarked, in an
American
ship, for New-York. I was destitute
of all property, and relied, for the
payment
of the debts which I was obliged to
contract, as well as for my future
subsistence
,
on my remittance, to Waldegrave.
I hastened to Philadelphia, and was soon
informed that my friend was dead. His
death had taken place a long time since
my remittance to him, hence this disaster
was a subject of regret chiefly on his own
account. I entertained no doubt but
that my property had been secured, and
that either some testamentary directions,
or some papers had been left behind
respecting this affair
VOL. II I
I sought out those who were formerly
our mutual acquaintance, I found that
they were wholly strangers to his affairs.
They could merely relate some
particulars
of his singular death, and point out
the lodgings which he formerly occupied.
Hither I forthwith repaired, and
discovered
that he lived in this house with
his sister, disconnected with its other
inhabitants. They described his mode
of life in terms that shewed them to be
very imperfectly acquainted with it. It
was easy indeed to infer, from their aspect
and manners, that little sympathy or
union could have subsisted between them
and their co-tenants, and this inference
was confirmed by their insinuations, the
growth of prejudice and envy. They
told me that Waldegrave's sister had gone
to live in the country, but whither or for
how long, she had not condescended to
inform them, and they did not care to ask.
She was a topping dame whose notions
were much too high for her station.
Who was more nice than wise, and yet
was one who could stoop, when it most
became her to stand upright. It was no
business of theirs, but they could not
but mention their suspicions that she had
good reasons for leaving the city, and
for concealing the place of her retreat.
Some things were hard to be disguised.
They spoke for themselves, and the
only way to hinder disagreeable
discoveries
,
was to keep out of sight.
I was wholly a stranger to
Waldegrave's
sister. I knew merely that he
had such a relation. There was nothing
therefore to outbalance this
unfavourable
report, but the apparent malignity
and grossness of those who gave it. It was
not, however, her character about which
I was solicitous, but merely the place
where she might be found, and the
suitable
inquiries respecting her deceased
brother, be answered. On this head,
these people professed utter ignorance
and were either unable or unwilling to
direct me to any person in the city who
knew more than themselves. After
much discourse they, at length, let fall
an intimation that if any one knew her
place of retreat, it was probably a country
lad, by name Huntly, who lived near the
Forks
of Delaware. After Waldegrave's
death, this lad had paid his sister a visit,
and seemed to be admitted on a very
confidential footing. She left the house,
for the last time, in his company, and he,
therefore, was most likely to know what
had become of her.
The name of Huntly was not totally
unknown to me. I myself was born
and brought up in the neighbouring
township of Chetasco. I had some
knowledge of your family, and your name
used often to be mentioned by
Waldegrave
,
as that of one who, at a maturer
age, would prove himself useful to his
country. I determined therefore to apply
to you for what information you could
give. I designed to visit my father who
lives in Chetasco and relieve him from
that disquiet which his ignorance of my
fate could not fail to have inspired, and
both these ends could be thus, at the same
time, accomplished.
Before I left the city, I thought it
proper to apply to the merchant on whom
my bill had been drawn. If this bill
had been presented and paid, he had
doubtless preserved some record of it,
and hence a clue might be afforded,
though every other expedient should
fail. My usual ill fortune pursued me
upon this occasion, for the merchant had
lately become insolvent, and, to avoid the
VOL. II. 4 2
rage of his creditors, had fled, without
leaving any vestige of this or similar
transactions behind him. He had, some
years since, been an adventurer from
Holland, and was suspected to have
returned thither.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XIV.
I came
hither with an heart
desponding of success. Adversity had
weakened my faith in the promises of the
future, and I was prepared to receive just
such tidings as you have communicated.
Unacquainted with the secret motives of
Waldegrave and his sister, it is impossible
for me to weigh the probabilities of their
rectitude. I have only my own assertion
to produce in support of my claim. All
other evidence, all vouchers and papers,
which might attest my veracity, or sanction
my claim in a court of law, are buried in
the ocean. The bill was transmitted just
before my departure from Madeira, and
the letters by which it was accompanied,
informed Waldegrave of my design to
follow it immediately. Hence he did not,
it is probable, acknowledge the receipt of
my letters. The vessels in which they
were sent, arrived in due season. I was
assured that all letters were duly
deposited
in the post-office, where, at present,
mine are not to be found.
You assure me that nothing has been
found among his papers, hinting at any
pecuniary transaction between him and
me. Some correspondence passed
between
us previous to that event. Have
no letters, with my signature, been found?
Are you qualified, by your knowledge of
his papers, to answer me explicitly? Is
it not possible for some letters to have
been mislaid?
I am qualified, said I, to answer your
inquiries beyond any other person in
the world. Waldegrave maintained
only general intercourse with the rest of
mankind. With me his correspondence
was copious, and his confidence, as I
imagined
,
without bounds. His books and
papers were contained in a single chest,
at his lodgings, the keys of which he had
about him when he died. These keys
I carried to his sister, and was authorized
by her to open and examine the contents
of this chest. This was done with the
utmost care. These papers are now in
my possession. Among them no paper,
of the tenor you mention, was found, and
no letter with your signature. Neither
Mary Waldegrave nor I are capable of
disguising the truth or committing an
injustice. The moment she receives
conviction of your right she will restore
this money to you. The moment I
imbibe
this conviction, I will exert all my
influence, and it is not small, to induce
her to restore it. Permit me, however, to
question you in your turn. Who was the
merchant on whom your bill was drawn,
what was the date of it, and when did the
bill and its counterparts arrive?
I do not exactly remember the date
of the bills. They were made out,
however
,
six days before I myself embarked
which happened on the tenth of August
1784. They were sent by three vessels,
one of which was bound to Charleston
and the others to New-York. The last
arrived within two days of each other,
and about the middle of November in
the same year. The name of the payer
was Monteith.
After a pause of recollection, I
answered
,
I will not hesitate to apprise you
of every thing which may throw light
upon this transaction, and whether
favourable
or otherwise to your claim. I
have told you among my friends' papers
your name is not to be found. I must
likewise repeat that the possession of
this money by Waldegrave was wholly
unknown to us till his death. We are
likewise unacquainted with any means
by which he could get possession of so
large a sum in his own right. He spent
no more than his scanty stipend as a
teacher, though this stipend was
insufficient
to supply his wants. This
Bank-receipt
is dated in December 1784, a
fortnight, perhaps, after the date that
you have mentioned. You will perceive
how much this coincidence, which could
scarcely have taken place by chance, is
favourable to your claim.
Mary Waldegrave resides, at
present
,
at Abingdon. She will rejoice, as
I do, to see one who, as her brother's
friend, is entitled to her affection. Doubt
not but that she will listen with
impartiality
and candour to all that you can
urge in defence of your title to this
money. Her decision will not be
precipitate
,
but it will be generous and just,
and founded on such reasons that, even
if it be adverse to your wishes, you will
be compelled to approve it.
I can entertain no doubt, he answered,
as to the equity of my claim. The
coincidences
you mention are sufficient to
convince me, that this sum was received
upon my bill, but this conviction must
necessarily be confined to myself. No
one but I can be conscious to the truth
of my own story. The evidence on
which I build my faith, in this case, is
that of my own memory and senses; but
this evidence cannot make itself
conspicuous
to you. You have nothing but
my bare assertion, in addition to some
probabilities flowing from the conduct of
Waldegrave. What facts may exist to
corroborate my claim, which you have
forgotten, or which you may think proper
to conceal, I cannot judge. I know not
what is passing in the secret of your
hearts; I am unacquainted with the
character
of this lady and with yours. I have
nothing on which to build surmises and
suspicions of your integrity, and nothing
to generate unusual confidence, the
frailty of your virtue and the strength
of your temptations I know not.
However
she decides in this case, and
whatever
opinion I shall form as to the
reasonableness
of her decision, it will not
become me either to upbraid her, or to
nourish discontentment and repinings.
I know that my claim has no legal
support: that, if this money be resigned
to me, it will be the impulse of
spontaneous
justice, and not the coercion of law
to which I am indebted for it. Since,
therefore, the justice of my claim is to
be, measured not by law, but by simple
VOL. II. K
equity. I will candidly acknowledge, that
as yet it is uncertain whether I ought
to receive, even should Miss
Waldegrave
be willing to give it. I know my
own necessities and schemes, and in
what degree this money would be
subservient
to these; but I know not the
views and wants of others, and cannot
estimate the usefulness of this money
to them. However I decide upon your
conduct in withholding or retaining it,
I shall make suitable allowance for my
imperfect knowledge of your motives
and wants, as well as for your
unavoidable
ignorance of mine.
I have related my sufferings from
shipwreck and poverty, not to bias your
judgment or engage your pity, but merely
because the impulse to relate them
chanced to awake; because my heart is
softened by the remembrance of
Waldegrave
,
who has been my only friend, and
by the sight of one whom he loved.
I told you that my father lived in
Chetasco. He is now aged, and I am
his only child. I should have rejoiced
in being able to relieve his grey hairs
from labour to which his failing strength
cannot be equal. This was one of my
inducements in coming to America.
Another was, to prepare the way for a
woman whom I married in Europe, and
who is now awaiting intelligence from
me in London. Her poverty is not less
than my own, and by marrying against the
wishes of her kindred, she has bereaved
herself of all support but that of her
husband. Whether I shall be able to
rescue her from indigence, whether
I shall alleviate the poverty of my father
or increase it by burthening his scanty
friends by my own maintenance as well
as his, the future alone can determine.
I confess that my stock of patience
and hope has never been large, and that
my misfortunes have nearly exhausted
it. The flower of my years has been
consumed in struggling with adversity,
and my constitution has received a shock
from sickness and mistreatment in
Portugal
,
which I cannot expect long to
survive...But I make you sad (he
continued
.)
I have said all that I meant to
say in this interview. I am impatient
to see my father, and night has already
come. I have some miles yet to ride to
his cottage and over a rough road. I
will shortly visit you again, and talk to
you at greater leisure on these and other
topics. At present I leave you.
I was unwilling to part so abruptly
with this guest, and intreated him to
prolong his visit, but he would not be
prevailed upon. Repeating his promise
of shortly seeing me again, he mounted
his horse and disappeared. I looked
after him with affecting and complex
emotions. I reviewed the incidents of
this unexpected and extraordinary
interview
,
as if it had existed in a dream.
An hour had passed, and this stranger
had alighted among us as from the
clouds, to draw the veil from those
obscurities
which had bewildered us so long,
to make visible a new train of disastrous
consequence flowing from the untimely
death of thy brother, and to blast that
scheme of happiness on which thou
and I had so fondly meditated.
But what wilt thou think of this
new born claim? The story, hadst
thou observed the features and guize of
the relater, would have won thy implicit
credit. His countenance exhibited
deep traces of the afflictions he had
endured and the fortitude which he had
exercised. He was sallow and
emaciated
,
K 2
but his countenance was full of
seriousness and dignity. A sort of
ruggedness
of brow, the token of great
mental exertion and varied experience,
argued a premature old age.
What a mournful tale! Is such the
lot of those who wander from their
rustic homes in search of fortune. Our
countrymen are prone to enterprize, and
are scattered over every sea and everyland
in pursuit of that wealth which will not
screen them from disease and infirmity,
which is missed much oftener than
found, and which, when gained, by no
means compensates them for the
hardships
and vicissitudes endured in the
pursuit.
But what if the truth of these
pretentions
be admitted? The money must
be restored to its right owner. I know
that whatever inconveniences may follow
the deed, thou wilt not hesitate to act
justly. Affluence and dignity, however
valuable, may be purchased too dear.
Honesty will not take away its keenness
from the winter blast, its ignominy and
unwholesomeness from servile labour,
or strip of it charms the life of elegance
and leisure; but these, unaccompanied
with self-reproach, are less deplorable
than wealth and honour, the possession
of which is marred by our own
disapprobation
.
I know the bitterness of this sacrifice.
I know the impatience with which your
poverty has formerly been borne, how
much your early education is at war
with that degradation and obscurity to
which your youth has been condemned,
How earnestly your wishes panted after
a state, which might exempt you from
dependence upon daily labour and on
the caprices of others, and might secure
to you leisure to cultivate and indulge
your love of knowledge and your social
and beneficent affections.
Your motive for desiring a change
of fortune has been greatly enforced
since we have become known to each
other. Thou hast honoured me with
thy affection, but that a union, on which
we rely for happiness, could not take
place while both of us were poor. My
habits, indeed, have made labour and
rustic obscurity less painful than they
would prove to my friend, but my
present condition is wholly inconsistent
with marriage. As long as my exertions
are insufficient to mantain as both, it
would be unjustifiable to burthen you
with new cares and duties. Of this
you are more thoroughly convinced than
I am. The love of independence and
ease, and impatience of drudgery, are
woven into your constitution. Perhaps
they are carried to an erroneous extreme,
and derogate from that uncommon
excellence
by which your character is, in
other respects, distinguished, but they
cannot be removed.
This obstacle was unexpectedly
removed by the death of your brother.
However justly to be deplored was this
catastrophe, yet like every other event,
some of its consequences were good.
By giving you possession of the means
of independence and leisure, by enabling
us to complete a contract which poverty
alone had thus long delayed, this event
has been, at the same time, the most
disastrous and propitious which could
have happened.
Why thy brother should have
concealed
from us the possession of this
money; why, with such copious means
of indulgence and leisure, he should
still pursue his irksome trade, and live
in so penurious a manner, has been
a topic of endless and unsatisfactory
conjecture between us. It was not
dfficult
to suppose that this money was held
in trust for another, but in that case it
was unavoidable that some document or
memorandum, or at least some claimant
would appear. Much time has since
elapsed, and you have thought yourself
at length justified in appropriating this
money to your own use.
Our flattering prospects are now
shut in. You must return to your
original poverty, and once more depend
for precarious subsistence on your needle
You cannot restore the whole, for
unavoidable
expenses, and the change of
your mode of living, has consumed
some part of it. For so much you must
consider yourself as Weymouth's debtor.
Repine not my friend, at this
unlooked-for
reverse. Think upon the merits
and misfortunes of your brother's friend,
think upon his aged father whom we
shall enable him to rescue from poverty;
think upon his desolate wife, whose
merits are, probably, at least equal to
your own, and whose helplessness is
likely to be greater. I am not insensible
to the evils which have returned upon
us with augmented force, after having,
for a moment, taken their flight. I know
the precariousness of my condition,
and that of my sisters, that our
subsistence
hangs upon the life of an old
man. My uncle's death will transfer
this property to his son, who is a stranger
and an enemy to us, and the first act
of whose authority will unquestionably
be to turn us forth from these doors.
Marriage with thee was anticipated
with joyous emotions, not merely on my
own account, or on thine, but likewise
for the sake of those beloved girls, to
whom that event would enable me to
furnish an asylum.
But wedlock is now more distant
than ever. My heart bleeds to think
of the sufferings which my beloved
Mary is again fated to endure, but
regrets are only aggravations of calamity.
They are pernicious, and it is our duty
to shake them off.
I can entertain no doubts as to the
equity of Weymouth's claim. So many
coincidences could not have happened by
chance. The non-appearance of any
letters
or papers connected with it is indeed
a mysterious circumstance, but why
should Waldegrave be studious of
preserving
these? They were useless
paper
,
and might, without impropriety, be
cast away, or made to serve any
temporary
purpose. Perhaps, indeed, they
still lurk in some unsuspected corner.
To wish that time may explain this
mystery in a diffierent manner, and so
as to permit our retention of this money
is, perhaps, the dictate of selfishness.
The transfer to Weymouth will not be
productive of less benefit to him and to
his family, than we should derive from
the use of it.
These considerations, however, will
be weighed when we meet. Meanwhile
I will return to my narrative.
VOL. II. L
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XV.
Here,
my friend, thou must
permit me to pause. The following
incidents
are of a kind to which the most
ardent invention has never conceived a
parallel. Fortune, in her most wayward
mood, could scarcely be suspected of an
influence like this. The scene was
pregnant
with astonishment and horror. I
cannot, even now, recall it without
reviving
the dismay and confusion which I
then experienced.
Possibly, the period will arrive when
I shall look back without agony on the
perils I have undergone. That period
is still distant. Solitude and sleep are
now no more than the signals to summon
up a tribe of ugly phantoms. Famine,
and blindness, and death, and savage
enemies, never fail to be conjured up by
the silence and darkness of the night. I
cannot dissipate them by any efforts of
reason. My cowardice requires the
perpetual
consolation of light. My heart
droops when I mark the decline of the
sun, and I never sleep but with a candle
burning at my pillow. If, by any chance,
I should awake and find myself immersed
in darkness, I know not what act of
desperation
I might be suddenly impelled to
commit.
I have delayed this narrative, longer
than my duty to my friend enjoined.
Now that I am able to hold a pen, I will
hasten to terminate that uncertainty with
regard to my fate, in which my silence
has involved thee. I will recall that
series of unheard of and disastrous
vicissitudes
which has constituted the latest
portion of my life.
I am not certain, however, that I shall
relate them in an intelligible manner.
One image runs into another, sensations
succeed in so rapid a train, that I fear, I
shall be unable to distribute and express
them with sufficient perspicuity. As I look
back, my heart is sore and aches within
my bosom. I am conscious to a kind of
complex sentiment of distress and
forlornness
that cannot be perfectly pourtrayed
by words; but I must do as well as I can.
In the utmost vigour of my faculties, no
eloquence that I possess would do justice
to the tale. Now in my languishing and
feeble state, I shall furnish thee with
little more than a glimpse of the truth.
With these glimpses, transient and faint
as they are, thou must be satisfied.
I have said that I slept. My memory
assures me of this: It informs of the
previous circumstances of my laying
aside my clothes, of placing the light upon
a chair within reach of my pillow, of
throwing myself upon the bed, and of
gazing on the rays of the moon reflected
on the wall, and almost obscured by
those of the candle. I remember my
occasional relapses into fits of incoherent
fancies, the harbingers of sleep: I
remember, as it were, the instant when
my thoughts ceased to flow, and my
senses were arrested by the leaden wand
of forgetfulness.
My return to sensation and to
consciousness
took place in no such tranquil
scene. I emerged from oblivion by
degrees so slow and so faint, that their
succession cannot be marked. When
enabled at length to attend to the
information
which my senses afforded, I was
VOL. II. L 2
conscious, for a time, of nothing but
existence. It was unaccompanied with
lassitude or pain, but I felt disinclined
to stretch my limbs, or raise my eye-lids.
My thoughts were wildering and mazy,
and though consciousness were present,
it was disconnected with the loco-motive
or voluntary power.
From this state a transition was
speedily
effected. I perceived that my posture
was supine, and that I lay upon my
back. I attempted to open my eyes.
The weight that oppressed them was too
great for a slight exertion to remove.
The exertion which I made cost me a
pang more acute than any which I ever
experienced. My eyes, however, were
opened; but the darkness that environed
me was as intense as before.
I attempted to rise, but my limbs were
cold, and my joints had almost lost their
flexibility. My efforts were repeated, and
at length I attained a sitting posture. I
was now sensible of pain in my shoulders
and back. I was universally in that state
to which the frame is reduced by blows
of a club, mercilessly and endlessly
repeated; my. temples throbbed and my
face was covered with clamy and cold
drops, but that which threw me into
deepest consternation was, my inability
to see. I turned my head to different
quarters, I stretched my eye-lids, and
exerted every visual energy, but in vain.
I was wrapt in the murkiest and most
impenetrable gloom.
The first effort of reflection was to
suggest the belief that I was blind; that
disease is known to assail us in a moment
and without previous warning. This
surely was the misfortune that had now
befallen me. Some ray, however fleeting
and uncertain, could not fail to be
discerned, if the power of vision were not
utterly extinguished. In what
circumstances
could I possibly be placed, from
which every particle of light should, by
other means, be excluded.
This led my thoughts into a new
train. I endeavoured to recall the past,
but the past was too much in
contradiction
to the present, and my intellect was
too much shattered by external violence,
to allow me accurately to review it.
Since my sight availed nothing to the
knowledge of my condition, I betook
myself to other instruments. The element
which I breathed was stagnant and cold.
The spot where I lay was rugged and hard.
I was neither naked nor clothed, a shirt
and trossars composed my dress, and
the shoes and stockings, which always
accompanied these, were now wanting,
What could I infer from this scanty garb,
this chilling atmosphere, this stony bed?
I had awakened as from sleep, What
was my condition when I fell asleep?
Surely it was different from the present.
Then I inhabited a lightsome chamber,
and was stretched upon a down bed. Now
I was supine upon a rugged surface and
immersed in palpable obscurity. Then
I was in perfect health; now my frame
was covered with bruises and every
joint was racked with pain. What
dungeon or den had received me, and
by whose command was I transported
hither?
After various efforts I stood upon
my feet. At first I tottered and
staggered
.
I stretched out my hands on
all sides but met only with vacuity. I
advanced forward. At the third step my
foot moved something which lay upon
the ground, I stooped and took it up, and
found, on examination, that it was an
Indian Tom-hawk. This incident
afforded
me no hint from which I might
conjecture my state.
Proceeding irresolutely and slowly
forward, my hands at length touched
a wall. This, like the flooring, was of
stone, and was rugged and impenetrable.
I followed this wall. An advancing
angle occurred at a short distance, which
was followed by similar angles. I
continued
to explore this clue, till the
suspicion occurred that I was merely
going round the walls of a vast and
irregular apartment.
The utter darkness disabled me
from comparing directions and distances.
This discovery, therefore, was not made
on a sudden and was still entangled with
some doubt. My blood recovered some
warmth, and my muscles some elasticity,
but in proportion as my sensibility
returned my pains augmented.
Overpowered
by my fears and my agonies
Idesisted from my fruitless search, and sat
down, supporting my back against the
wall.
My excruciating sensations for a time
occupied my attention. These, in
combination
with other causes, gradually
produced
a species of delirium. I existed
as it were in a wakeful dream. With
nothing to correct my erroneous
perceptions
,
the images of the past occurred in
capricious combinations, and vivid hues.
Methought I was the victim of some tyrant
who had thrust me into a dungeon of his
fortress, and left me no power to determine
whether he intended I should perish
with famine, or linger out a long life in
hopeless imprisonment: Whether the
day was shut out by insuperable walls,
or the darkness that surrounded me, was
owing to the night and to the smallness
of those cranies through which day-light
was to be admitted, I conjectured in vain.
Sometimes I imagined myself buried
alive. Methought I had fallen into
seeming
death and my friends had consigned
me to the tomb, from which a
resurrection
was impossible. That in such a
case, my limbs would have been confined
to a coffin, and my coffin to a grave,
and that I should instantly have been
suffocated, did not occur to destroy
my supposition: Neither did this
supposition
overwhelm me with terror or
prompt my efforts at deliverance. My
state was full of tumult and confusion,
and my attention was incessantly
divided
between my painful sensations and
my feverish dreams,
There is no standard by which time
can be measured, but the succession of
our thoughts, and the changes that take
place in the external world. From the
latter I was totally excluded. The
former made the lapse of some hours
appear like the tediousness of weeks and
months. At length, a new sensation,
recalled my rambling meditations, and
gave substance to my fears. I now felt
the cravings of hunger, and perceived
that unless my deliverance were speedily
effected. I must suffer a tedious and
lingering death.
I once more tasked my understanding
and my senses, to discover the nature of
my present situation and the means of
escape. I listened to catch some sound.
I heard an unequal and varying echo,
sometimes near and sometimes distant,
sometimes dying away and sometimes
swelling into loudness. It was unlike
any thing I had before heard, but it was
evident that it arose from wind sweeping
through spacious halls and winding
passages
.
These tokens were incompatible
with the result of the examination I had
made. If my hands were true I was
VOL. II. M
immured between walls, through which
there was no avenue.
I now exerted my voice, and cried as
loud as my wasted strength would admit.
Its echoes were sent back to me in broken
and confused sounds and from above.
This effort was casual, but some part of
that uncertainty in which I was involved,
was instantly dispelled by it. In passing
through the cavern on the former day,
I have mentioned the verge of the pit at
which I arrived. To acquaint me as far
as was possible, with the dimensions of
the place, I had hallooed with all my
force, knowing that sound is reflected
according to the distance and relative
positions of the substances from which it
is repelled.
The effect produced by my voice on
this occasion resembled, with remarkable
exactness, the effect which was then
produced
.
Was I then shut up in the same
cavern? Had I reached the brink of the
same precipice and been thrown
headlong
into that vacuity? Whence else
could arise the bruises which I had
received
,
but from my fall? Yet all
remembrance
of my journey hither was lost. I
had determined to explore this cave on the
ensuing day, but my memory informed me
not that this intention had been carried
into effect. Still it was only possible to
conclude that I had come hither on my
intended expedition and had been thrown
by another, or had, by some ill chance,
fallen into the pit.
This opinion was conformable to
what I had already observed. The
pavement
and walls were rugged like those of
the footing and sides of the cave through
which I had formerly passed.
But if this were true, what was the
abhorred catastrophe to which I was now
reserved? The sides of this pit were
inaccessible
:
human foot-steps would never
wander into these recesses. My friends
were unapprised of my forlorn state. Here
I should continue till wasted by famine.
In this grave should I linger out a few
days, in unspeakable agonies and then
perish forever.
The inroads of hunger were already
experienced, and this knowledge of the
desperateness of my calamity, urged me
to phrenzy. I had none but capricious
and unseen fate to condemn. The author
of my distress and the means he had
taken to decoy me hither, were
incomprehensible
.
Surely my senses were
fettered or depraved by some spell. I
was still asleep, and this was merely a
tormenting vision, or madness had seized
me, and the darkness that environed and
the hunger that afflicted me, existed only
in my own distempered imagination.
The consolation of these doubts could
not last long. Every hour added to the
proofs that my perceptions were real. My
hunger speedily became ferocious. I
tore the linen of my shirt between my
teeth and swallowed the fragments. I
felt a strong propensity to bite the flesh
from my arm. My heart overflowed
with cruelty, and I pondered on the
delight I should experience in rending
some living animal to pieces, and
drinking
its blood and grinding its quivering
fibers between my teeth.
This agony had already passed beyond
the limits of endurance. I saw that time,
instead of bringing respite or relief,
would only aggravate my wants, and that
my only remaining hope was to die before
I should be assaulted by the last extremes
of famine. I now recollected that a
Tom-hawk was at hand, and rejoiced in
the possession of an instrument by which
VOL. II. M 2
I could so effectually terminate my
sufferings
.
I took it in my hand, moved its edge
over my fingers, and reflected on the
force that was required to make it reach
my heart. I investigated the spot where
it should enter, and strove to fortify
myself with resolution to repeat the
stroke a second or third time, if the first
should prove insufficient. I was sensible
that I might fail to inflict a mortal wound,
but delighted to consider that the blood
which would be made to flow, would
finally release me, and that meanwhile
my pains would be alleviated by
swallowing
this blood.
You will not wonder that I felt some
reluctance to employ so fatal though
indispensable a remedy. I once more
ruminated on the possibility of rescuing
myself by other means. I now reflected
that the upper termination of the wall
could not be at an immeasurable distance
from the pavement. I had fallen from
an height, but if that height had been
considerable, instead of being merely
bruised, should I not have been dashed
into pieces?
Gleams of hope burst anew upon my
soul. Was it not possible, I asked, to
reach the top of this pit. The sides were
rugged and uneven. Would not their
projectures and abruptnesses serve me as
steps by which I might ascend in safety.
This expedient was to be tried without
delay. Shortly my strength would fail
and my doom would be irrevocably
sealed.
I will not enumerate my laborious
efforts, my alternations of despondency
and confidence, the eager and
unwearied
scrutiny with which I examined
the surface, the attempts which I made,
and the failures which, for a time,
succeeded
each other. An hundred times,
when I had ascended some feet from the
bottom, I was compelled to relinquish
my undertaking by the
untenable
smoothness
of the spaces which remained to be
gone over. An hundred times I threw
myself, exhausted by fatigue and my
pains, on the ground. The consciousness
was gradually restored that till I had
attempted
every part of the wall, it was
absurd to despair, and I again drew my
tottering limbs and aching joints to that
part of the wall which had not been
surveyed
.
At length, as I stretched my hand
upward, I found somewhat that seemed
like a recession in the wall. It was
possible
that this was the top of the cavity,
and this might be the avenue to liberty.
My heart leaped with joy, and I
proceeded
to climb the wall. No
undertaking
could be conceived more arduous
than this. The space between this verge
and the floor was nearly smooth. The
verge was higher from the bottom than
my head. The only means of ascending
that were offered me were by my hands,
with which I could draw myself upward
so as, at length, to maintain my hold
with my feet.
My efforts were indefatigable, and at
length I placed myself on the verge,
when this was accomplished my strength
was nearly gone. Had I not found space
enough beyond this brink to stretch
myself
at length, I should unavoidably have
fallen backward into the pit, and all my
pains had served no other end than to
deepen my despair and hasten my
destruction
.
What impediments and perils
remained
to be encountered I could not judge.
I was now inclined to forbode the worst.
The interval of repose which was
necessary
to be taken, in order to recruit my
strength, would accelerate the ravages
of famine, and leave me without the
power to proceed.
In this state, I once more consoled
myself that an instrument of death was
at hand. I had drawn up with me the
Tom-hawk, being sensible that should
this impediment be overcome others
might remain that would prove
insuperable
.
Before I
employed it
, however, I
cast my eyes wildly and languidly around.
The darkness was no less intense than
in the pit below, and yet two objects
were distinctly seen.
They resembled a fixed and obscure
flame. They were motionless. Though
lustrous themselves they created no
illumination
around them. This
circumstance
,
added to others, which reminded
me of similar objects, noted on former
occasions, immediately explained the
nature of what I beheld. These were
the eyes of a panther.
Thus had I struggled to obtain a
post where a savage was lurking, and
waited only till my efforts should place
me within reach of his fangs. The first
impulse was to arm myself against this
enemy. The desperateness of my
condition
was, for a moment, forgotten. The
weapon which was so lately lifted
against my own bosom, was now raised to
defend my life against the assault of
another.
There was no time for deliberation
and delay. In a moment he might spring
from his station and tear me to pieces.
My utmost speed might not enable me
to reach him where he sat, but merely
to encounter his assault. I did not reflect
how far my strength was adequate to
save me. All the force that remained
was mustered up and exerted in a throw.
No one knows the powers that are
latent in his constitution. Called forth
by imminent dangers, our efforts
frequently
exceed our most sanguine belief.
Though tottering on the verge of
dissolution
,
and apparently unable to crawl
rom this spot, a force was exerted in this
throw, probably greater than I had ever
before exerted. It was resistless and
unerring. I aimed at the middle space
between these glowing orbs. It penetrated
the scull and the animal fell, struggling
and shrieking, on the ground.
My ears quickly informed me when
his pangs were at an end. His cries and
his convulsions lasted for a moment and
then ceased. The effect of his voice,
in these subterranean abodes, was
unspeakably
rueful.
The abruptness of this incident, and
the preternatural exertion of my strength,
left me in a state of languor and sinking
from which slowly and with difficulty I
recovered. The first suggestion that
occurred was to feed upon the carcass
of this animal. My hunger had arrived
at that pitch where all fastidiousness and
scruples are at an end. I crept to the
spot...I will not shock you by relating
the extremes to which dire necessity had
driven me. I review this scene with
loathing and horror. Now that it is past
I look back upon it as on some hideous
dream. The whole appears to be some
freak of insanity. No alternative was
offered, and hunger was capable to be
appeased, even by a banquet so
detestable
.
If this appetite has sometimes
subdued
the sentiments of nature, and
compelled
the mother to feed upon the flesh
VOL. II. N
of her offspring, it will not excite
amazement
that I did not turn from the yet
warm blood and reeking fibres of a brute.
One evil was now removed, only to
give place to another. The first
sensations
of fullness had scarcely been felt
when my stomach was seized by pangs
whose acuteness exceeded all that I ever
before experienced. I bitterly lamented
my inordinate avidity. The excruciations
of famine were better than the agonies
which this abhorred meal had produced.
Death was now impending with no less
proximity and certainty, though in a
different
form. Death was a sweet relief
for my present miseries, and I vehemently
longed for its arrival. I stretched
myself
on the ground. I threw myself
into every posture that promised some
alleviation of this evil. I rolled along
the pavement of the cavern, wholly
inattentive
to the dangers that environed
me. That I did not fall into the pit,
whence I had just emerged, must be
ascribed to some miraculous chance.
How long my miseries endured, it is
not possible to tell. I cannot even form
a plausible conjecture. Judging by the
lingering train of my sensations, I should
conjecture that some days elapsed in this
deplorable condition, but nature could
not have so long sustained a conflict like
this.
Gradually my pains subsided and I
fell into a deep sleep. I was visited by
dreams of a thousand hues. They led
me to flowing streams and plenteous
banquets
,
which, though placed within my
view, some power forbade me to approach.
From this sleep I recovered to the
fruition
of solitude and darkness, but my
frame was in a state less feeble than
before. That which I had eaten had
produced
tomporary
distress, but on the
whole had been of use. If this food
had not been provided for me I should
scarcely have avoided death. I had
reason therefore to congratulate myself
on the danger that had lately occured.
I had acted without foresight, and
yet no wisdom could have prescribed
more salutary measures. The panther
was slain, not from a view to the relief
of my hunger, but from the
self-preserving
and involuntary impulse. Had I
fore-known the pangs to which my
ravenous
and bloody meal would give birth,
I should have carefully abstained, and
yet these pangs were a useful effort of
nature to subdue and convert to
nourishment
the matter I had swallowed.
I was now assailed by the torments
of thirst. My invention and my courage
were anew bent to obviate this pressing
evil. I reflected that there was some
recess from this cavern, even from the
spot where I now stood. Before, I was
doubtful whether in this direction from
this pit any avenue could be found, but
since the panther had come hither there
was reason to suppose the existence of
some such avenue.
I now likewise attended to a sound,
which, from its invariable tenour,
denoted
somewhat different from the whistling
of a gale. It seemed like the murmur
of a running stream. I now prepared to
go forward, and endeavoured to move
along in that direction in which this sound
apparently came.
On either side and above my head,
there was nothing but vacuity. My
steps were to be guided by the pavement,
which, though unequal and rugged,
appeared
,
on the whole, to ascend. My
safety required that I should employ both
hands and feet in exploring my way.
VOL. II. N 2
I went on thus for a considerable
period. The murmur, instead of
becoming
more distinct, gradually died
away. My progress was arrested by
fatigue, and I began once more to
despond
.
My exertions, produced a
perspiration
,
which, while it augmented my
thirst, happily supplied me with
imperfect
means of appeasing it.
This expedient would, perhaps, have
been accidentally suggested, but my
ingenuity
was assisted by remembering
the history of certain English prisoners
in Bengal, whom their merciless enemy
imprisoned in a small room, and some of
whom preserved themselves alive merely
by swallowing the moisture that flowed
from their bodies. This experiment I
now performed with no less success.
This was slender and transitory
consolation
.
I knew that, wandering at
random, I might never reach the outlet
of this cavern, or might be disabled, by
hunger and fatigue, from going farther
than the outlet. The cravings which
had lately been satiated, would speedily
return, and my negligence had cut me
off from the resource which had recently
been furnished. I thought not till now
that a second meal might be
indispensable
.
To return upon my foot-steps to the
spot where the dead animal lay was an
heartless project. I might thus be placing
myself at an hopeless distance from
liberty. Besides my track could not be
retraced. I had frequently deviated
from a straight direction for the sake of
avoiding impediments. All of which I
was sensible was, that I was travelling
up an irregular acclivity. I hoped
sometime
to reach the summit, but had no
reason for adhering to one line of ascent
in preference to another.
To remain where I was, was
manifestly
absurd. Whether I mounted or
descended, a change of place was most
likely to benefit me. I resolved to vary
my direction, and, instead of ascending,
keep along the side of what I accounted
an hill. I had gone some hundred feet
when the murmur, before described,
once more saluted my ear.
This sound, being imagined to
proceed from a running stream, could
not but light up joy in the heart of one
nearly perishing with thirst. I proceeded
with new courage. The sound
approached
no nearer nor became more distinct,
but as long as it died not away, I was
satisfied to listen and to hope.
I was eagerly observant if any the
least glimmering of light, should visit
this recess. At length, on the right
hand a gleam, infinitely faint, caught my
attention. It was wavering and unequal.
I directed my steps towards it. It
became
more vivid, and permanent. It
was of that kind, however, which
proceeded
from a fire, kindled with dry
sticks, and not from the sun. I now heard
the crackling of flames.
This sound made me pause, or at
least to proceed with circumspection.
At length the scene opened, and I
found myself at the entrance of a cave.
I quickly reached a station when I saw
a fire burning. At first no other object
was noted, but it was easy to infer that the
fire was kindled by men, and that they
who kindled it could be at no great
distance
.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XVI.
Thus
was I delivered from my
prison and restored to the enjoyment of
the air and the light. Perhaps the chance
was almost miraculous that led me to this
opening. In any other direction, I might
have involved myself in an inextricable
maze, and rendered my destruction sure:
but what now remained to place me in
absolute security? Beyond the fire I
could see nothing; but since the smoke
rolled rapidly away, it was plain that on
the opposite side the cavern was open
to the air.
I went forward, but my eyes were
fixed upon the fire; presently, in
consequence
of changing my station, I perceived
several feet, and the skirts of blankets. I
was somewhat startled at these
appearances
.
The legs were naked, and scored into
uncouth figures. The
mocassins
which
lay beside them, and which were adorned
in a grotesque manner, in addition to
other incidents, immediately suggested
the suspicion that they were Indians.
No spectacle was more adapted than this
to excite wonder and alarm. Had some
mysterious power snatched me from the
earth, and cast me, in a moment, into the
heart of the wilderness? Was I still in
the vicinity of my paternal habitation, or
was I thousands of miles distant?
Were these the permanent inhabitants
of this region, or were they wanderers
and robbers? While in the heart of
the mountain I had entertained a vague
belief that I was still within the
precincts
of Norwalk. This opinion was
shaken for a moment by the objects
which I now beheld, but it insensibly
returned; yet, how was this opinion to
be reconciled to appearances so strange
and uncouth, and what measure did a due
regard to my safety enjoin me to take?
I now gained a view of four brawny
and terrific figures, stretched upon the
ground. They lay parallel to each other,
on their left sides; in consequence of
which their faces were turned from me.
Between each was an interval where lay
a musket. Their right hands seemed
placed upon the stocks of their guns, as
if to seize them on the first moment of
alarm.
The aperture through which these
objects were seen, was at the back of
the cave, and some feet from the ground.
It was merely large enough to suffer an
human body to pass. It was involved
in profound darkness, and there was no
danger of being suspected or discovered
as long as I maintained silence, and kept
out of vew.
It was easily imagined that these
guests would make but a short sojourn
in this spot. There was reason to suppose
that it was now night, and that after
a short repose, they would start up and
resume their journey. It was my first
design to remain shrowded in this covert
till their departure, and I prepared to
endure imprisonment and thirst
somewhat
longer.
Meanwhile my thoughts were busy
in accounting for this spectacle. I need
not tell thee that Norwalk is the
termination
of a sterile and narrow tract, which
begins in the Indian country. It forms
a sort of rugged and rocky vein, and
continues upwards of fifty miles. It is
VOL. II. O
crossed in a few places by narrow and
intricate paths, by which a
communication
is maintained between the farms
and settlements on the opposite sides of
the ridge.
During former Indian wars, this
rude surface was sometimes traversed by
the Red-men, and they made, by means
of it, frequent and destructive inroads
into the heart of the English settlements.
During the last war, notwithstanding
the progress of population, and the
multiplied perils of such an expedition,
a band of them had once penetrated
into Norwalk, and lingered long enough
to pillage and murder some of the
neighbouring inhabitants.
I have reason to remember that event.
My father's house was placed on the
verge of this solitude. Eight of these
assassins assailed it at the dead of night.
My parents and an infant child were
murdered in their beds; the house
was pillaged, and then burnt to the
ground. Happily, myself and my two
sisters were abroad upon a visit. The
preceding day had been fixed for our
return to our father's house, but a storm
occurred, which made it dangerous to
cross the river, and by obliging us to
defer our journey, rescued us from
captivity
or death.
Most men are haunted by some
species
of terror or antipathy, which they
are, for the most part, able to trace to
some incident which befel them in their
early years. You will not be surprized
that the fate of my parents, and the sight
of the body of one of this savage band,
who, in the pursuit that was made after
them, was overtaken and killed, should
produce lasting and terrific images in my
fancy. I never looked upon, or called
up the image of a savage without
shuddering
.
I knew that, at this time, some
hostilities
had been committed on the
frontier
;
that a long course of injuries and
encroachments had lately exasperated
the Indian tribes; that an implacable
and exterminating war was generally
expected. We imagined ourselves at
an inaccessible distance from the
danger
,
but I could not but remember
that this persuasion was formerly as
strong as at present, and that an
expedition
,
which had once succeeded, might
possibly be attempted again. Here was
every token of enmity and bloodshed.
Each prostrate figure was furnished with
a rifled musquet, and a leathern bag tied
round his waist, which was, probably,
stored with powder and ball.
From these reflections, the sense of
my own danger was revived and
enforced
,
but I likewise ruminated on
the evils which might impend over others.
I should, no doubt, be safe by remaining
in this nook; but might not some means
be pursued to warn others of their
danger? Should they leave this spot,
without notice of their approach being
given to the fearless and pacific tenants
of the neighbouring district, they might
commit, in a few hours, the most horrid
and irreparable devastation.
The alarm could only be diffused in
one way. Could I not escape,
unperceived
,
and without alarming the
sleepers
,
fom this cavern? The slumber of
an Indian is broken by the slightest noise;
but if all noise be precluded, it is
commonly
profound. It was possible, I
conceived, to leave my present post, to
descend into the cave, and issue forth
without the smallest signal. Their
supine posture assured me that they were
VOL. II. O 2
asleep. Sleep usually comes at their
bidding, and if, perchance, they should
be wakeful at an unseasonable moment,
they always sit upon their haunches, and,
leaning their elbows on their knees,
consume
the tedious hours in smoking. My
peril would be great. Accidents which
I could not foresee, and over which I
had no command, might occur to awaken
some one at the moment I was passing
the fire. Should I pass in safety, I might
issue forth into a wilderness, of which I
had no knowledge, where I might wander
till I perished with famine, or where my
foot-steps might be noted and pursued,
and overtaken by these implacable foes.
These perils were enormous and
imminent
;
but I likewise considered that I
might be at no great distance from the
habitations of men, and, that my escape
might rescue them from the most
dreadful
calamities, I determined to make
this dangerous experiment without
delay
.
I came nearer to the aperture, and
had, consequently, a larger view of this
recess. To my unspeakable dismay, I
now caught a glimpse of one, seated at
the fire. His back was turned towards
me so that I could distinctly survey his
gigantic form and fantastic ornaments.
My project was frustrated. This
one was probably commissioned to watch
and to awaken his companions when a
due portion of sleep had been taken.
That he would not be unfaithful or
remiss in the performance of the part
assigned to him was easily predicted. To
pass him without exciting his notice,
and the entrance could not otherwise be
reached, was impossible. Once more I
shrunk back and revolved with
hopelessness
and anguish, the necessity to which
I was reduced.
This interval of dreary foreboding did
not last long. Some motion in him that
was seated by the fire attracted my
notice. I looked, and beheld him rise
from his place and go forth from the
cavern. This unexpected incident led
my thoughts into a new channel. Could
not some advantage be taken of his
absence
?
Could not this opportunity be
seized for making my escape? He had
left his gun and hatchet on the ground.
It was likely, therefore, that he had not
gone far, and would speedily return.
Might not these weapons be seized, and
some provision be thus made against the
danger of meeting him without, or of
being pursued?
Before a resolution could be formed,
a new sound saluted my ear. It was a
deep groan, succeeded by sobs that
seemed struggling for utterance, but
were vehemently counteracted by the
sufferer. This low and bitter
lamentation
apparently proceeded from some one
within the cave. It could not be from
one of this swarthy band. It must then
proceed from a captive, whom they
had reserved for torment or servitude,
and who had seized the opportunity
afforded by the absence of him that
watched, to give vent to his despair.
I again thrust my head forward, and
beheld, lying on the ground, apart from
the rest, and bound hand and foot, a
young girl. Her dress was the coarse
russet garb of the country, and bespoke
her to be some farmer's daughter. Her
features denoted the last degree of fear
and anguish, and she moved her limbs in
such a manner as shewed that the
ligatures
by which she was confined,
produced
,
by their tightness, the utmost
degree of pain.
My wishes were now bent not only
to preserve myself, and to frustrate the
future attempts of these savages, but
likewise
to relieve this miserable victim.
This could only be done by escaping
from the cavern and returning with
seasonable
aid. The sobs of the girl were
likely to rouse the sleepers. My
appearance
before her would prompt her to
testify
her surprise by some exclamation or
shriek. What could hence be predicted
but that the band would start on their
feet, and level their unerring pieces at
my head!
I know not why I was insensible to
these dangers. My thirst was rendered
by these delays intolerable. It took from
me, in some degree, the power of
deliberation
.
The murmurs which had drawn
me hither continued still to be heard.
Some torrent or cascade could not be far
distant from the entrance of the cavern,
and it seemed as if one draught of clear
water was a luxury cheaply purchased
by death itself. This, in addition to
considerations
more disinterested, and which
I have already mentioned, impelled me
forward.
The girl's cheek rested on the hard
rock, and her eyes were dim with tears.
As they were turned towards me,
however
,
I hoped that my movements would
be noticed by her gradually and without
abruptness. This expectation was
fulfilled
.
I had not advanced many steps
before she discovered me. This moment
was critical beyond all others in the
course of my existence. My life was
suspended, as it were, by a spider's
thread. All rested on the effect which
this discovery should make upon this
feeble victim.
I was watchful of the first movement
of her eye, which should indicate a
consciousness
of my presence. I laboured,
by gestures and looks, to deter her from
betraying her emotion. My attention
was, at the same time, fixed upon the
sleepers, and an anxious glance was cast
towards the quarter whence the watchful
savage might appear.
I stooped and seized the musquet
and hatchet. The space beyond the fire
was, as I expected, open to the air. I
issued forth with trembling steps. The
sensations inspired by the dangers which
environed me, added to my recent
horrors
,
and the influence of the moon,
which had now gained the zenith, and
whose lustre dazzled my long benighted
senses, cannot be adequately described.
For a minute I was unable to
distinguish
objects. This confusion was
speedily
corrected, and I found myself on the
verge of a steep. Craggy eminences arose
on all sides. On the left hand was a
space that offered some footing, and
hither I turned. A torrent was below
me, and this path appeared to lead to it.
It quickly appeared in sight, and all
foreign cares were, for a time, suspended.
This water fell from the upper regions
of the hill, upon a flat projecture which
was continued on either side, and on part
of which I was now standing. The path
was bounded on the left by an
inaccessible
wall, and on the right terminated at
the distance of two or three feet from
the wall, in a precipice. The water was
eight or ten paces distant, and no
impediment
seemed likely to rise between us.
I rushed forward with speed.
My progress was quickly checked.
Close to the falling water, seated on the
edge, his back supported by the rock, and
his legs hanging over the precipice, I
now beheld the savage who left the cave
VOL. II. P
before me. The noise of the cascade
and the improbability of interruption, at
least from this quarter, had made him
inattentive to my motions.
I paused. Along this verge lay the
only road by which I could reach the
water, and by which I could escape. The
passage was completely occupied by this
antagonist. To advance towards him, or
to remain where I was, would produce
the same effect. I should, in either case,
be detected. He was unarmed; but his
outcries would instantly summon his
companions to his aid. I could not hope
to overpower him, and pass him in
defiance
of his opposition. But if this were
effected, pursuit would be instantly
commenced
.
I was unacquainted with the
way. The way was unquestionably
difficult
.
My strength was nearly
annihilated
:
I should be overtaken in a moment,
or their deficiency in speed would be
supplied
by the accuracy of their aim. Their
bullets, at least, would reach me.
There was one method of removing
this impediment. The piece which I held
in my hand was cocked. There could
be no doubt that it was loaded. A
precaution
of this kind would never be
omitted by a warrior of this hue. At a
greater distance than this, I should not
fear to reach the mark. Should I not
discharge it, and, at the same moment,
rush forward to secure the road which my
adversary's death would open to me?
Perhaps you will conceive a purpose
like this to have argued a sanguinary
and murderous disposition. Let it be
remembered, however, that I entertained
no doubts about the hostile designs of
these men. This was sufficiently
indicated
by their arms, their guise, and the
captive who attended them. Let the fate
of my parents be, likewise, remembered.
I was not certain but that these very
men were the assassins of my family,
and were those who had reduced me and
my sisters to the condition of orphans
and dependants. No words can describe
the torments of my thirst. Relief to
these torments, and safety to my life,
were within view. How could I
hesitate
?
Yet I did hesitate. My aversion to
bloodshed was not to be subdued but by
the direst necessity. I knew, indeed,
that the discharge of a musquet would
only alarm the enemies which remained
behind; but I had another and a better
weapon in my grasp. I could rive the
head of my adversary, and cast him
headlong, without any noise which
should be heard, into the cavern.
Still I was willing to withdraw, to
re-enter the cave, and take shelter in the
darksome recesses from which I had
emerged. Here I might remain,
unsuspected
,
till these detested guests should
depart. The hazards attending my
reentrance
were to be boldly encountered,
and the torments of unsatisfied thirst
were to be patiently endured, rather
than imbrue my hands in the blood of
my fellow men. But this expedient
would be ineffectual if my retreat should
be observed by this savage. Of that I
was bound to be incontestibly assured.
I retreated, therefore, but kept my eye
fixed at the same time upon the enemy.
Some ill fate decreed that I should
not retreat unobserved. Scarcely had I
withdrawn three paces when he started
from his seat, and, turning towards me,
walked with a quick pace. The shadow
of the rock, and the improbability of
meeting an enemy here, concealed me
for a moment from his observation. I
VOL. II. P 2
stood still. The slightest motion would
have attracted his notice. At present,
the narrow space engaged all his
vigilance
.
Cautious foot-steps, and attention
to the path, were indispensable to his
safety. The respite was momentary, and
I employed it in my own defence.
How otherwise could I act? The
danger
that impended aimed at nothing less
than my life. To take the life of another
was the only method of averting it. The
means were in my hand, and they were
used. In an extremity like this, my
muscles would have acted almost in
defiance
of my will.
The stroke was quick as lightning,
and the wound mortal and deep. He
had not time to descry the author of his
fate; but, sinking on the path, expired
without a groan. The hatchet buried
itself in his breast, and rolled with him
to the bottom of the precipice.
Never before had I taken the life of
an human creature. On this head, I
had, indeed, entertained somewhat of
religious scruples. These scruples did
not forbid me to defend myself, but they
made me cautious and reluctant to
decide
.
Though they could not withhold
my hand, when urged by a necessity
like this, they were sufficient to make
me look back upon the deed with remorse
and dismay.
I did not escape all compunction in
the present instance, but the tumult of
my feelings was quickly allayed. To
quench my thirst was a consideration by
which all others were supplanted. I
approached the torrent, and not only
drank copiously, but laved my head,
neck, and arms, in this delicious element.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XVII.
Never
was any delight
worthy
of comparison with the raptures
which I then experienced. Life, that
was rapidly ebbing, appeared to return
upon me with redoubled violence. My
languors, my excruciating heat, vanished
in a moment, and I felt prepared to
undergo
the labours of Hercules.
Having
fully supplied the demands of nature
in this respect, I returned to reflection
on the circumstances of my situation.
The path winding round the hill was
now free from all impediments What
remained but to precipitate my flight? I
might speedily place myself beyond all
danger. I might gain some hospitable
shelter, where my fatigues might be
repaired by repose, and my wounds be
cured. I might likewise impart to my
protectors seasonable information of the
enemies who meditated their destruction.
I thought upon the condition of the
hapless girl whom I had left in the
power of the savages. Was it
impossible
to rescue her? Might I not relieve
her from her bonds, and make her the
companion of my flight? The exploit was
perilous but not impracticable. There
was something dastardly and
ignominious
in withdrawing from the danger, and
leaving an helpless being exposed to it.
A single minute might suffice to snatch
her from death or captivity. The parents
might deserve that I should hazard or
even sacrifice my life, in the cause of
their child.
After some fluctuation, I determined
to return to the cavern, and attempt the
rescue of the girl. The success of this
project depended on the continuance of
their sleep. It was proper to approach
with wariness, and to heed the smallest
token which might bespeak their
condition
.
I crept along the path, bending
my ear forward to catch any sound that
might arise. I heard nothing but the
half-stifled sobs of the girl.
I entered with the slowest and most
anxious circumspection. Every thing was
found in its pristine state. The girl noticed
my entrance with a mixture of terror and
joy. My gestures and looks enjoined
upon her silence. I stooped down, and
taking another hatchet, cut assunder the
deer-skin thongs by which her wrists and
ancles were tied. I then made signs for
her to rise and follow me. She willingly
complied with my directions; but her
benumbed joints and lacerated sinews,
refused to support her. There was no
time to be lost; I therefore, lifted her in
my arms, and, feeble and tottering as I
was, proceeded with this burthen, along
the perilous steep, and over a most
rugged
path.
I hoped that some exertion would
enable her to retrieve the use of her
limbs. I set her, therefore, on her feet,
exhorting her to walk as well as she was
able, and promising her my occasional
assistance. The poor girl was not
deficient
in zeal, and presently moved along
with light and quick steps. We
speedily
reached the bottom of the hill.
No fancy can conceive a scene more
wild and desolate than that which now
presented itself. The soil was nearly
covered with sharp fragments of stone.
Between these sprung brambles and
creeping vines, whose twigs, crossing
and intertwining with each other, added
to the roughness below, made the
passage
infinitely toilsome. Scattered over
this space were single cedars with their
ragged spines and wreaths of moss, and
copses of dwarf oaks, which were only
new emblems of sterility.
I was wholly unacquainted with the
scene before me. No marks of
habitation
or culture, no traces of the
footsteps
of men, were discernible. I
scarcely
knew in what region of the globe I
was placed. I had come hither by means
so inexplicable, as to leave it equally in
doubt, whether I was separated from
my paternal abode by a river or an ocean
I made inquiries of my companion.
but she was unable to talk coherently.
She answered my questions with
weeping
,
and sobs, and intreaties, to fly from
the scene of her distress. I collected
from her, at length, that her father's
house had been attacked on the
preceding
evening, and all the family but
herself
destroyed. Since this disaster she
had walked very fast and a great way,
but knew not how far or in what
direction
.
In a wilderness like this, my only
hope was to light upon obscure paths,
made by cattle. Meanwhile I
endeavoured
to adhere to one line, and to
burst through the vexatious obstacles
which encumbered our way. The ground
was concealed by the bushes, and we
were perplexed and fatigued by a
continual
succession of hollows and
prominences
.
At one moment we were nearly
thrown headlong into a pit. At another
we struck our feet against the angles of
stones. The branches of the oak
rebounded
in our faces or entangled our legs,
and the unseen thorns inflicted on us a
thousand wounds.
VOL. II. Q
I was obliged, in these arduous
circumstances
,
to support not only myself
but my companion. Her strength was
overpowered by her evening journey,
and the terror of being overtaken,
incessantly
harrassed her.
Sometimes we lighted upon tracks
which afforded us an easier footing, and
inspired us with courage to proceed.
These, for a time, terminated at a brook
or in a bog, and we were once more
compelled to go forward at random.
One of these tracks insensibly became
more beaten, and, at length, exhibited
the traces of wheels. To this I adhered,
confident that it would finally conduct us
to a dwelling.
On either side, the undergrowth of
shrubs and brambles continued as before.
Sometimes small spaces were observed,
which had lately been cleared by fire.
At length a vacant space of larger
dimensions than had hitherto occured,
presented itself to my view. It was a
field of some acres, that had, apparently,
been upturned by the hoe. At the
corner of this field was a small house.
My heart leaped with joy at this
sight. I hastened toward it, in the
hope that my uncertainties, and toils,
and dangers, were now drawing to a
close. This dwelling was suited to the
poverty and desolation which surrounded
it. It consisted of a few unhewn logs
laid upon each other, to the height of
eight or ten feet, including a
quadrangular
space of similar dimensions, and
covered by thatch. There was no
window, light being sufficiently admitted
into the crevices between the logs.
These had formerly been loosely
plastered
with clay, but air and rain had
crumbled and washed the greater part
of this rude cement away. Somewhat
like a chimney, built of half-burnt bricks,
was perceived at one corner. The door
was fastened by a leathern thong, tied to
a peg.
All within was silence and darkness.
I knocked at the door and called, but no
one moved or answered. The tenant,
whoever he was, was absent. His leave
could not be obtained, and I, therefore,
entered without it. The autumn had
made some progress, and the air was
frosty and sharp. My mind and muscles
had been, of late, so strenuously
occupied
,
that the cold had not been felt.
The cessation of exercise, however,
quickly restored my sensibility in this
respect, but the unhappy girl complained
of being half frozen.
Fire, therefore, was the first object
of my search. Happily, some embers
were found upon the hearth, together
with potatoe stalks and dry chips. Of
these, with much difficulty, I kindled a
fire, by which some warmth was imparted
to our shivering limbs. The light enabled
me, as I sat upon the ground, to survey
the interior of this mansion.
Three saplins, stripped of their
branches, and bound together at their
ends by twigs, formed a kind of
bedstead
,
which was raised from the ground
by four stones. Ropes srtetched across
these, and covered by a blanket,
constituted
the bed. A board, of which one
end rested on the bedstead, and the other
was thrust between the logs that
composed
the wall, sustained the stale
fragments
of a rye-loaf, and a cedar bucket
kept entire by withs instead of hoops.
In the bucket was a little water, full of
droppings from the roof, drowned insects
and sand, a basket or two neatly made,
and an hoe, with a stake thrust into it
VOL. II. Q 2
by way of handle, made up all the
furniture
that was visible
Next to cold, hunger was the most
urgent necessity by which we were now
pressed. This was no time to give ear
to scruples. We, therefore,
uncerimoniously
divided the bread and the water
between us. I had now leisure to bestow
some regards upon the future.
These remnants of fire and food
convinced me that this dwelling was
usually inhabited, and that it had lately
been deserted. Some engagement had
probably carried the tenant abroad. His
absence might be terminated in a few
minutes, or might endure through the
night. On his return, I questioned not
my power to appease any indignation he
might feel at the liberties which I had
taken. I was willing to suppose him
one who would readily afford us all the
information and succour that we needed.
If he should not return till sunrise, I
meant to resume my journey. By the
comfortable meal we had made, and the
repose of a few hours, we should be
considerably
invigorated and refreshed, and
the road would lead us to some more
hospitable tenement.
My thoughts were too tumultuous,
and my situation too precarious, to allow
me to sleep. The girl, on the contrary,
soon sunk into a sweet oblivion of all her
cares. She laid herself, by my advice,
upon the bed, and left me to ruminate
without interruption.
I was not wholly free from the
apprehension
of danger. What influence
his boisterous and solitary life might
have upon the temper of the being who
inhabited this hut, I could not predict.
How soon the Indians might awake, and
what path they would pursue, I was
equally unable to guess. It was by no
means impossible that they might tread
upon my foot-steps, and knock, in a few
minutes, at the door of this cottage. It
behoved me to make all the preparation
in my power against untoward
incidents
.
I had not parted with the gun which
I had first seized in the cavern, nor
with the hatchet which I had afterwards
used to cut the bands of the girl. These
were, at once, my trophies and my
means of defence, which it had been
rash and absurd to have relinquished.
My present reliance was placed upon
these.
I now, for the first time, examined
the prize that I had made. Other
considerations
had prevented me till now,
from examining the structure of the
piece, but I could not but observe that
it had two barrels, and was lighter and
smaller than an ordinary musquet. The
light of the fire now enabled me to
inspect it with more accuracy.
Scarcely had I fixed my eyes upon
the stock, when I perceived marks that
were familiar to my apprehension. Shape,
ornaments, and cyphers, were evidently
the same with those of a piece which I
had frequently handled. The marks
were of a kind which could not be
mistaken
.
This piece was mine; and when
I left my uncle's house, it was deposited,
as I believed, in the closet of my
chamber
.
Thou wilt easily conceive the
inference
which this circumstance suggested.
My hairs rose and my teeth chattered
with horror. My whole frame was
petrified
,
and I paced to and fro, hurried
from the chimney to the door, and from
the door to the chimney, with the
misguided
fury of a maniac.
I needed no proof of my calamity
more incontestible than this. My uncle
and my sisters had been murdered; the
dwelling had been pillaged, and this
had been a part of the plunder.
Defenceless
and asleep, they were assailed by
these inexorable enemies, and I, who
ought to have been their protector and
champion, was removed to an
immeasurable
distance, and was disabled, by
some accursed chance, from affording
them the succour which they needed.
For a time, I doubted whether I
had not witnessed and shared this
catastrophe. I had no memory of the
circumstances that preceded my awaking
in the pit. Had not the cause of my
being cast into this abyss some
connection
with the ruin of my family? Had
I not been dragged hither by these
savages, and reduced, by their malice,
to that breathless and insensible
condition
?
Was I born to a malignant
destiny never tired of persecuting?
Thus had my parents and their infant
offspring perished, and thus completed
was the fate of all those to whom my
affections cleaved, and whom the first
disaster had spared.
Hitherto the death of the savage,
whom I had dispatched with my hatchet,
had not been remembered without some
remorse. Now my emotions were totally
changed: I was somewhat comforted in
thinking that thus much of necessary
vengeance had been executed. New
and more vehement regrets were excited
by reflecting on the forbearance I had
practised when so much was in my
power. All the miscreants had been at
my mercy, and a bloody retribution
might, with safety and ease, have been
inflicted on their prostrate bodies.
It was now too late. What of
consolation
or of hope remained to me? To return
to my ancient dwelling, now polluted with
blood, or perhaps, nothing but a smoking
ruin, was abhorred. Life, connected
with remembrance of my misfortunes
was detestable. I was no longer anxious
for flight. No change of the scene but
that which terminated all consciousness,
could I endure to think of.
Amidst these gloomy meditations
the idea was suddenly suggested of
returning, with the utmost expedition, to
the cavern. It was possible that the
assassins were still asleep. He who was
appointed to watch and to make, in due
season, the signal for resuming their
march, was forever silent. Without this
signal it was not unlikely that they would
sleep till dawn of day. But if they
should be roused, they might be
overtaken
or met, and, by choosing a proper
station, two victims might at least fall.
The ultimate event to myself would
surely be fatal; but my own death was
an object of desire rather than of dread.
To die thus speedily, and after some
atonement was made for those who had
already been slain, was sweet.
The way to the mountain was difficult
and tedious, but the ridge was distinctly
seen from the door of the cottage, and
I trusted that auspicious chance would
lead me to that part of it where my prey
was to be found. I snatched up the
gun and tom-hawk in a transport of
eagerness. On examining the former,
I found that both barrels were deeply
loaded.
This piece was of extraordinary
workmanship. It was the legacy of an
English officer, who died in Bengal, to
Sarsefield. It was constructed for the
purposes not of sport but of war. The
VOL. II. R
the artist had made it a congeries of
tubes and springs, by which every
purpose of protection and offence was
effectually served. A dagger's blade
was attached to it, capable of being
fixed at the end, and of answering the
destructive purpose of a bayonet. On
his departure from Solebury, my friend
left it, as a pledge of his affection, in
my possession. Hitherto I had chiefly
employed it in shooting at a mark, in
order to improve my sight; now was I to
profit by the gift in a different way.
Thus armed, I prepared to sally
forth on my adventurous expedition.
Sober views might have speedily
succeeded
to the present tempest of my
passions. I might have gradually
discovered
the romantic and criminal
temerity of my project, the folly of
revenge
,
and the duty of preserving my life
for the benefit of mankind. I might have
suspected the propriety of my
conclusion
,
and have admitted some doubts as to
the catastrophe which I imagined to have
befallen my uncle and sisters. I might,
at least, have consented to ascertain their
condition with my own eyes; and for this
end have returned to the cottage, and have
patiently waited till the morning light
should permit me to resume my journey.
This conduct was precluded by a new
incident. Before I opened the door I
looked through a crevice of the wall,
and perceived three human figures at the
farther end of the field. They
approached
the house. Though indistinctly
seen, something in their port persuaded
me that these were the Indians from
whom I had lately parted. I was startled
but not dismayed. My thirst of
vengeance was still powerful, and I
believed that the moment of its
gratification
was hastening. In a short time
they would arrive and enter the house. In
what manner should they be received?
I studied not my own security. It
was the scope of my wishes to kill the
whole number of my foes; but that
being done, I was indifferent to the
consequences
.
I desired not to live to relate
or to exult in the deed.
To go forth was perilous and useless.
All that remained was to sit upon the
ground opposite the door, and fire at
each as he entered. In the hasty survey
I had taken of this apartment, one object
had been overlooked, or imperfectly
noticed. Close to the chimney was an
aperture, formed by a cavity partly in
the wall and in the ground. It was the
entrance of an oven, which resembled,
on the outside, a mound of earth, and
which was filled with dry stalks of
potatoes
and other rubbish.
Into this it was possible to thrust
my body. A sort of screen might be
formed of the brush-wood, and more
deliberate and effectual execution be
done upon the enemy. I weighed not
the disadvantages of this scheme, but
precipitately threw myself into this cavity.
I discovered, in an instant, that it was
totally unfit for my purpose, but it was
too late to repair my miscarriage.
This wall of the hovel was placed
near the verge of a sand-bank. The
oven was erected on the very brink.
This bank being of a loose and mutable
soil, could not sustain my weight. It
sunk, and I sunk along with it. The height
of the bank was three or four feet, so that,
though disconcerted and embarrassed, I
received no injury. I still grasped my
gun, and resumed my feet in a moment.
What was now to be done? The
bank screened me from the view of the
VOL. II. R 2
savages. The thicket was hard by,
and if I were eager to escape, the way
was obvious and sure. But though
single, though enfeebled by toil, by
abstinence and by disease, and though
so much exceeded in number and
strength, by my foes, I was determined
to await and provoke the contest.
In addition to the desperate impulse
of passion, I was swayed by thoughts
of the danger which beset the sleeping
girl, and from which my flight would
leave her without protection. How
strange is the destiny that governs
mankind
!
The consequence of shrouding
myself in this cavity had not been
foreseen. It was an expedient which
courage, and not cowardice suggested?
and yet it was the only expedient by
which flight had been rendered
practicable
.
To have issued from the door
would only have been to confront, and
not to elude the danger.
The first impulse prompted me to
re-enter the cottage by this avenue, but
this could not be done with certainty
and expedition. What then remained?
While I deliberated, the men approached,
and, after a moment's hesitation, entered
the house, the door being partly open.
The fire on the hearth enabled them
to survey the room. One of them
uttered
a sudden exclamation of surprize.
This was easily interpreted. They had
noticed the girl who had lately been
their captive lying asleep on the blanket.
Their astonishment at finding her here,
and in this condition, may be easily
conceived
.
I now reflected that I might place
myself, without being observed, near the
entrance, at an angle of the building,
and shoot at each as he successively
came forth. I perceived that the bank
conformed to two sides of the house,
and that I might gain a view of the
front and of the entrance, without
exposing
myself to observation.
I lost no time in gaining this station
The bank was as high as my breast. It
was easy, therefore, to crouch beneath
it, to bring my eye close to the verge,
and, laying my gun upon the top of it
among the grass, with its muzzles pointed
to the door, patiently to wait their
forthcoming
.
My eye and my ear were equally
attentive to what was passing. A low
and muttering conversation was
maintained
in the house. Presently I heard
an heavy stroke descend. I shuddered,
and my blood ran cold at the sound. I
entertained no doubt but that it was the
stroke of an hatchet on the head or
breast of the helpless sleeper.
It was followed by a loud shriek.
The continuance of these shrieks proved
that the stroke had not been instantly
fatal. I waited to hear it repeated, but
the sounds that now arose were like
those produced by dragging somewhat
along the ground. The shrieks,
meanwhile
,
were incessant and piteous. My
heart faltered, and I saw that mighty
efforts must be made to preserve my
joints and my nerves stedfast. All
depended
on the strenuous exertions and
the fortunate dexterity of a moment.
One now approached the door, and
came forth, dragging the girl, whom he
held by the hair, after him. What
hindered me from shooting at his first
appearance, I know not. This had been
my previous resolution. My hand
touched
the trigger, and as he moved, the
piece was levelled at his right ear.
Perhaps the momentous consequences
of my failure, made me wait till his
ceasing to move might render my aim
more sure.
Having dragged the girl, still
piteously
shrieking, to the distance of ten
feet from the house, he threw her from
him with violence. She fell upon the
ground, and observing him level his piece
at her breast, renewed her supplications
in a still more piercing tone. Little did
the forlorn wretch think that her
deliverance
was certain and near. I rebuked
myself for having thus long delayed. I
fired, and my enemy sunk upon the
ground without a struggle.
Thus far had success attended me
in this unequal contest. The next shot
would leave me nearly powerless. If
that, however, proved as unerring as the
first, the chances of defeat were lessened.
The savages within, knowing the inten
tions of their associate with regard to the
captive girl, would probably mistake the
report which they heard for that of his
piece. Their mistake, however, would
speedily give place to doubts, and they
would rush forth to ascertain the truth.
It behoved me to provide a similar
reception
for him that next appeared.
It was as I expected. Scarcely was
my eye again fixed upon the entrance,
when a tawny and terrific visage was
stretched fearfully forth. It was the
signal of his fate. His glances cast
wildly and swiftly round, lighted upon
me, and on the fatal instrument which
was pointed at his forehead. His
muscles
were at once exerted to withdraw
his head, and to vociferate a warning
to his fellow, but his movement was too
slow. The ball entered above his ear:
He tumbled headlong to the ground,
bereaved of sensation, though not of
life, and had power only to struggle and
mutter.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XVIII.
Think
not that I relate these
things with exultation or tranquility. All
my education and the habits of my life
tended to unfit me for a contest and a
scene like this. But I was not governed
by the soul which usually regulates my
conduct. I had imbibed from the
unparalleled
events which had lately happened
a spirit vengeful, unrelenting, and
ferocious
.
There was now an interval for flight.
Throwing my weapons away, I might
gain the thicket in a moment. I had no
ammunition, nor would time be afforded
VOL. II. S
me to re-load my piece. My antagonist
would render my poniard and my speed
of no use to me. Should he miss me as
I fled, the girl would remain to expiate,
by her agonies and death, the fate of his
companions.
These thoughts passed through my
mind in a shorter time than is demanded
to express them. They yielded to an
expedient
suggested by the sight of the gun
that had been raised to destroy the girl,
and which now lay upon the ground. I
am not large of bone, but am not
deficient
in agility and strength. All that
remained to me of these qualities was
now exerted; and dropping my own piece,
I leaped upon the bank, and flew to seize
my prize.
It was not till I snatched it from the
ground, that the propriety of regaining
my former post, rushed upon my
apprehension
.
He that was still posted in the
hovel would mark me through the seams
of the wall, and render my destruction
sure. I once more ran towards the bank,
with the intention to throw myself below
it. All this was performed in an instant;
but my vigilant foe was aware of his
advantage, and fired through an opening
between the logs. The bullet grazed
my cheek, and produced a benumbing
sensation that made me instantly fall to
the earth. Though bereaved of strength,
and fraught with the belief that I had
received a mortal wound, my caution
was not remitted. I loosened not my
grasp of the gun, and the posture into
which I accidentally fell enabled me to
keep an eye upon the house and an hand
upon the trigger. Perceiving my
condition
,
the savage rushed from his covert
in order to complete his work; but at
three steps from the threshold, he received
my bullet in his breast. The uplifted
tom-hawk fell from his hand, and,
uttering
a loud shriek, he fell upon the body
of his companion. His cries struck upon
my heart, and I wished that his better
fortune had cast this evil from him upon
me.
Thus I have told thee a bloody
and disastrous tale. When thou
reflectest
on the mildness of my habits, my
antipathy to scenes of violence and
bloodshed
,
my unacquaintance with the use
of fire-arms, and the motives of a soldier,
thou wilt scarcely allow credit to my
story. That one rushing into these
dangers, unfurnished with stratagems or
weapons, disheartened and enfeebled by
hardships and pain, should subdue four
antagonists, trained from their infancy
to the artifices and exertions of Indian
warfare, will seem the vision of fancy,
rather than the lesson of truth.
I lifted my head from the ground
and pondered upon this scene. The
magnitude of this exploit made me
question its reality. By attending to my
own sensations, I discovered that I had
received no wound, or at least, none of
which there was reason to complain.
The blood flowed plentifully from my
cheek, but the injury was superficial. It
was otherwise with my antagonists. The
last that had fallen now ceased to groan.
Their huge limbs, inured to combat
and
war-worn,
were useless to their own
defence, and to the injury of others.
The destruction that I witnessed was
vast. Three beings, full of energy and
heroism, endowed with minds strenuous
and lofty, poured out their lives before
me. I was the instrument of their
destruction. This scene of carnage and
blood was laid by me. To this havock
VOL. II. S 2
and horror was I led by such rapid
footsteps
!
My anguish was mingled with
astonishment
.
In spite of the force and
uniformity
with which my senses were
impressed by external objects, the
transition
I had undergone was so wild and
inexplicable; all that I had performed;
all that I had witnessed since my egress
from the pit, were so contradictory to
precedent events, that I still clung to the
belief that my thoughts were confused by
delirium. From these reveries I was at
length recalled by the groans of the girl,
who lay near me on the ground.
I went to her and endeavoured to
console her. I found that while lying
in the bed, she had received a blow
upon the side, which was still productive
of acute pain. She was unable to rise
or to walk, and it was plain that one or
more of her ribs had been fractured by
the blow.
I knew not what means to devise
for our mutual relief. It was possible
that the nearest dwelling was many
leagues distant. I knew not in what
direction to go in order to find it, and
my strength would not suffice to carry
my wounded companion thither in my
arms. There was no expedient but to
remain in this field of blood till the
morning.
I had scarcely formed this resolution
before the report of a musquet was heard
at a small distance. At the same
moment
,
I distinctly heard the whistling of
a bullet near me. I now remembered
that of the five Indians whom I saw in
the cavern, I was acquainted with the
destiny only of four. The fifth might
be still alive, and fortune might reserve
for him the task of avenging his
companions
.
His steps might now be tending
hither in search of them.
The musquet belonging to him who
was shot upon the threshold, was still
charged. It was discreet to make all
the provision in my power against
danger. I possessed myself of this gun,
and seating myself on the ground, looked
carefully on all sides, to descry the
aproach of the enemy. I listened with
breathless eagerness.
Presently voices were heard. They
ascended from that part of the thicket
from which my view was intercepted by
the cottage. These voices had
something
in them that bespoke them to
belong to friends and countrymen. As
yet I was unable to distinguish words.
Presently my eye was attracted to
one quarter, by a sound as of feet
trampling
down bushes. Several heads were
seen moving in succession, and at length,
the whole person was conspicuous. One
after another leaped over a kind of
mound which bordered the field, and
made towards the spot where I sat.
This band was composed of ten or
twelve persons, with each a gun upon
his shoulder. Their guise, the moment
it was perceived, dissipated all my
apprehensions
.
They came within the distance of
a few paces before they discovered me.
One stopped, and bespeaking the
attention
of his followers, called to know
who was there? I answered that I was
a friend, who intreated their assistance.
I shall not paint their astonishment when,
on coming nearer, they beheld me
surrounded
by the arms and dead bodies
of my enemies.
I sat upon the ground, supporting
my head with my left hand, and resting
on my knee the stock of an heavy
musquet
.
My countenance was wan and
haggard, my neck and bosom were died
in blood, and my limbs, almost stripped
by the brambles of their slender
covering
,
were lacerated by a thousand
wounds. Three savages, two of whom
were steeped in gore, lay at a small
distance
,
with the traces of recent life on
their visages. Hard by was the girl,
venting her anguish in the deepest
groans, and intreating relief from the
new comers.
One of the company, on approaching
the girl, betrayed the utmost
perturbation
.
Good God! he cried, is
this a dream? Can it be you? Speak!
Ah, my father! my father!
answered she, it is I indeed.
The company, attracted by this
dialogue, crowded round the girl, whom
her father, clasping in his arms, lifted
from the ground, and pressed, in a
transport of joy to his breast. This
delight was succeeded by solicitude
respecting her condition. She could
only answer his inquiries by
complaining
that her side was bruised to pieces.
How came you here?... Who hurt you?
... Where did the Indians carry you?
were questions to which she could make
no reply but by sobs and plaints.
My own calamities were forgotten
in contemplating the fondness and
compassion
of the man for his child. I
derived new joy from reflecting that I
had not abandoned her, and that she
owed her preservation to my efforts.
The inquiries which the girl was unable
to answer, were now put to me. Every
one interrogated who I was, whence I
had come, and what had given rise to
this bloody contest.
I was not willing to expatiate on my
story. The spirit which had hitherto
sustained me, began now to subside.
My strength ebbed away with my blood.
Tremors, lassitude, and deadly cold,
invaded me, and I fainted on the
ground.
Such is the capricious constitution of
the human mind. While dangers were
at hand, while my life was to be
preserved
only by zeal and vigilance, and
courage, I was not wanting to myself.
Had my perils continued or even
multiplied
,
no doubt my energies would
have kept equal pace with them, but
the moment that I was encompassed by
protectors, and placed in security, I grew
powerless and faint. My weakness
was proportioned to the duration and
intensity of my previous efforts, and the
swoon into which I now sunk, was no
doubt, mistaken by the spectators, for
death.
On recovering from this swoon, my
sensations were not unlike those which
I had experienced on awaking in the
pit. For a moment a mistiness involved
every object, and I was able to
distinguish
nothing. My sight, by rapid
degrees, was restored, my painful
dizziness
was banished, and I surveyed
the scene before me with anxiety and
wonder.
I found myself stretched upon the
ground. I perceived the cottage and
the neighbouring thicket, illuminated
by a declining moon. My head rested
upon something, which, on turning to
examine, I found to be one of the slain
Indians. The other two remained upon
the earth at a small distance, and in
the attitudes in which they had fallen.
Their arms, the wounded girl, and the
troop who were near me when I fainted,
were gone.
VOL. II. T
My head had reposed upon the
breast of him whom I had shot in this
part of his body. The blood had ceased
to ooze from the wound, but my
dishevelled
locks were matted and steeped
in that gore which had overflowed and
choaked up the orifice. I started from
this detestable pillow, and regained my
feet.
I did not suddenly recall what had
lately passed, or comprehend the nature
of my situation. At length, however,
late events were recollected.
That I should be abandoned in this
forlorn state by these men, seemed to
argue a degree of cowardice or cruelty,
of which I should have thought them
incapable. Presently, however, I
reflected
that appearances might have easily
misled them into a belief of my death:
on this supposition, to have carried me
away, or to have stayed beside me,
would be useless. Other enemies might
be abroad, or their families, now that
their fears were somewhat tranquilized,
might require their presence and
protection
.
I went into the cottage. The fire still
burned, and afforded me a genial warmth.
I sat before it and began to ruminate
on the state to which I was reduced, and
on the measures I should next pursue.
Day-light could not be very distant.
Should I remain in this hovel till the
morning, or immediately resume my
journey? I was feeble, indeed, but by
remaining here should I not increase
my feebleness? The sooner I should
gain some human habitation the better;
whereas watchfulness and hunger would
render me, at each minute, less able to
proceed than on the former.
This spot might be visited on the
next day; but this was involved in
uncertainty
.
The visitants, should any come,
would come merely to examine and bury
the dead, and bring with them neither
the clothing nor the food which my
necessities demanded. The road was
sufficiently discernible, and would,
unavoidably
,
conduct me to some dwelling.
I determined, therefore, to set out
without
delay. Even in this state I was not
unmindful that my safety might require
the precaution of being armed. Besides
the fusil, which had been given me by
Sarsefield, and which I had so
unexpectedly
recovered, had lost none of its value
in my eyes. I hoped that it had escaped
the search of the troop who had been
here, and still lay below the bank, in the
spot where I had dropped it.
In this hope I was not deceived. It
was found. I possessed myself of the
powder and shot belonging to one of
the savages, and loaded it. Thus
equipped
for defence, I regained the road,
and proceeded, with alacrity, on my
way. For the wound in my cheek,
nature had provided a styptic, but the
soreness was extreme, and I thought of
no remedy but water, with which I
might wash away the blood. My thirst
likewise incommoded me, and I looked
with eagerness for the traces of a spring.
In a soil like that of the wilderness
around me, nothing was less to be
expected than to light upon water. In
this respect, however, my destiny was
propitious. I quickly perceived water
in the ruts. It trickled hither from the
thicket on one side, and, pursuing it
among the bushes, I reached the
bubbling
source. Though scanty and
brackish
,
it afforded me unspeakable
refreshment
.
VOL. II. T 2
Thou wilt think, perhaps, that my
perils were now at an end; that the blood
I had already shed was sufficient for my
safety. I fervently hoped that no new
exigence would occur, compelling me to
use the arms that I bore in my own
defence
.
I formed a sort of resolution to
shun the contest with a new enemy,
almost at the expense of my own life. I
was satiated and gorged with slaughter,
and thought upon a new act of
destruction
with abhorrence and loathing.
But though I dreaded to encounter
a new enemy, I was sensible that an
enemy might possibly be at hand. I
had moved forward with caution, and
my sight and hearing were attentive to the
slightest tokens. Other troops, besides
that which I encountered, might be
hovering
near, and of that troop, I
remembered
that one at least had survived.
The gratification which the spring
had afforded me was so great, that I was
in no haste to depart. I lay upon a rock,
which chanced to be shaded by a tree
behind me. From this post I could
overlook the road to some distance, and,
at the same time, be shaded from the
observation of others.
My eye was now caught by
movements
which appeared like those of a
beast. In different circumstances, I
should have instantly supposed it to be
a wolf, or panther, or bear. Now my
suspicions were alive on a different
account, and my startled fancy figured
to itself nothing but an human
adversary
.
A thicket was on either side of the
road. That opposite to my station was
discontinued at a small distance by the
cultivated field. The road continued
along this field, bounded by the thicket
on the one side, and the open space on
the other. To this space the being who
was now descried was cautiously
approaching
.
He moved upon all fours, and
presently
came near enough to be
distinguished
.
His disfigured limbs, pendants
from his ears and nose, and his shorn
locks, were indubitable indications of a
savage. Occasionally he reared himself
above the bushes, and scanned, with
suspicious vigilance, the cottage and the
space surrounding it. Then he stooped,
and crept along as before.
I was at no loss to interpret these
appearances. This was my surviving
enemy. He was unacquainted with the
fate of his associates, and was now
approaching
the theatre of carnage, to
ascertain
their fate.
Once more was the advantage afforded
me. From this spot might unerring aim
be taken, and the last of this hostile troop
be made to share the fate of the rest.
Should I fire or suffer him to pass in
safety?
My abhorrence of bloodshed was not
abated. But I had not foreseen this
occurrence. My success hitherto had
seemed to depend upon a combination
of fortunate incidents, which could not
be expected again to take place; but now
was I invested with the same power.
The mark was near; nothing obstructed
or delayed; I incurred no danger, and
the event was certain.
Why should he be suffered to live?
He came hither to murder and despoil
my friends; this work he has, no doubt,
performed. Nay, has he not borne his
part in the destruction of my uncle and
my sisters? He will live only to pursue
the same sanguinary trade; to drink the
blood and exult in the laments of his
unhappy foes, and of my own brethren.
Fate has reserved him for a bloody and
violent death. For how long a time
soever it may be deferred, it is thus that
his career will inevitably terminate.
Should he be spared, he will still
roam in the wilderness, and I may again
be fated to encounter him. Then our
mutual situation may be widely
different
,
and the advantage I now possess
may be his.
While hastily revolving these thoughts
I was thoroughly aware that one event
might take place which would render all
deliberation useless. Should he spy me
where I lay, my fluctuations must end.
My safety would indispensably require
me to shoot. This persuasion made
me keep a stedfast eye upon his
motions
,
and be prepared to anticipate his
assault.
It now most seasonably occurred to
me that one essential duty remained to
be performed. One operation, without
which fire arms are useless, had been
unaccountably omitted. My piece was
uncocked. I did not reflect that in
moving
the spring, a sound would necessarily
be produced, sufficient to alarm him.
But I knew that the chances of escaping
his notice, should I be perfectly mute and
still, were extremely slender, and that, in
such a case, his movements would be
quicker than the light; it behoved me,
therefore, to repair my omission.
The sound struck him with alarm.
He turned and darted at me an inquiring
glance. I saw that forbearance was no
longer in my power; but my heart sunk
while I complied with what may surely
be deemed an indispensable necessity.
This faltering, perhaps it was, that made
me swerve somewhat from the fatal line.
He was disabled by the wound, but not
killed.
He lost all power of resistance, and
was, therefore, no longer to be dreaded.
He rolled upon the ground, uttering
doleful shrieks, and throwing his limbs
into those contorsions which bespeak the
keenest agonies to which ill-fated man
is subject. Horror, and compassion, and
remorse, were mingled into one
sentiment
,
and took possession of my heart.
To shut out this spectacle, I withdrew
from the spot, but I stopped before I
had moved beyond hearing of his cries.
The impulse that drove me from the
scene was pusillanimous and cowardly.
The past, however deplorable, could not
be recalled; but could not I afford some
relief to this wretch? Could not I, at
least, bring his pangs to a speedy close?
Thus he might continue, writhing and
calling upon death for hours. Why
should his miseries be uselessly
prolonged
?
There was but one way to end them.
To kill him outright, was the dictate of
compassion and of duty. I hastily
returned
,
and once more levelled my piece
at his head. It was a loathsome
obligation
,
and was performed with
unconquerable
reluctance. Thus to assault
and to mangle the body of an enemy,
already prostrate and powerless, was an
act worthy of abhorrence; yet it was, in
this case, prescribed by pity.
My faltering hand rendered this
second
bullet ineffectual. One expedient,
still more detestable, remained. Having
gone thus far, it would have been
inhuman
to stop short. His heart might easily
be pierced by the bayonet, and his
struggles
would cease.
This task of cruel lenity was at
length finished. I dropped the weapon
VOL. II. X
and threw myself on the ground,
overpowered
by the horrors of this scene.
Such are the deeds which perverse nature
compels thousands of rational beings to
perform and to witness! Such is the
spectacle
,
endlessly prolonged and
diversified
,
which is exhibited in every field of
battle; of which, habit and example, the
temptations of gain, and the illusions of
honour, will make us, not reluctant or
indifferent, but zealous and delighted
actors and beholders!
Thus, by a series of events
impossible
to be computed or foreseen, was the
destruction of a band, selected from their
fellows for an arduous enterprise,
distinguished
by prowess and skill, and equally
armed against surprize and force,
completed
by the hand of a boy, uninured to
hostility, unprovided with arms,
precipitate
and timerous! I have noted men
who seemed born for no end but by
their achievements to belie experience,
and baffle foresight, and outstrip belief.
Would to God that I had not deserved
to be numbered among these! But what
power was it that called me from the sleep
of death, just in time to escape the
merciless
knife of this enemy? Had my
swoon continued till he had reached the
spot, he would have effectuated my death
by new wounds and torn away the skin
from my brows. Such are the subtile
threads on which hangs the fate of man
and of the universe!
While engaged in these reflections, I
perceived that the moon-light had began
to fade before that of the sun. A dusky
and reddish hue spread itself over the
east. Cheered by this appearance, I once
more resumed my feet and the road. I
left the savage where he lay, but made
prize of his tom-hawk. I had left my
own in the cavern; and this weapon
added little to my burden. Prompted
by some freak of fancy, I stuck his
musquet
in the ground, and left it standing
upright in the middle of the road.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XIX.
I moved
forward with as quick
a pace as my feeble limbs would permit.
I did not allow myself to meditate. The
great object of my wishes was a dwelling
where food and repose might be
procured
.
I looked earnestly forward, and
on each side, in search of some token of
human residence; but the spots of
cultivation
,
the
well-pole,
the
worm-fence,
and
the hay-rick, were no where to be seen. I
did not even meet with a wild hog, or a
bewildered cow. The path was narrow,
and on either side was a trackless
wilderness
.
On the right and left were
VOL. II. X 2
the waving lines of mountainous ridges
which had no peculiarity enabling me to
ascertain whether I had ever before seen
them.
At length I noticed that the tracks
of wheels had disappeared from the path
that I was treading; that it became more
narrow, and exhibited fewer marks of
being frequented. These appearances
were discouraging. I now suspected
that I had taken a wrong direction, and
instead of approaching, was receding
from the habitation of men.
It was wisest, however, to proceed.
The road could not but have some origin
as well as end. Some hours passed away
in this uncertainty. The sun rose, and
by noon-day I seemed to be farther than
ever from the end of my toils. The
path was more obscure, and the
wilderness
more rugged. Thirst more
incommoded
me than hunger, but relief was
seasonably afforded by the brooks that
flowed across the path.
Coming to one of these, and having
slaked my thirst, I sat down upon the
bank, to reflect on my situation. The
circuity of the path had frequently been
noticed, and I began to suspect that
though I had travelled long, I had not
moved far from the spot where I had
commenced my pilgrimage.
Turning my eyes on all sides, I
noticed a sort of pool, formed by the
rivulet, at a few paces distant from the
road. In approaching and inspecting it,
I observed the foot-steps of cattle, who
had retired by a path that seemed much
beaten; I likewise noticed a cedar bucket,
broken and old, lying on the margin.
These tokens revived my drooping
spirits
,
and I betook myself to this new
track. It was intricate; but, at length,
led up a steep, the summit of which was
of better soil than that of which the flats
consisted. A clover field, and several
apple-trees, sure attendents of man, were
now discovered. From this space I
entered a corn-field, and at length, to my
inexpressible joy, caught a glimpse of an
house.
This dwelling was far different from
that I had lately left. It was as small
and as low, but its walls consisted of
boards. A window of four panes
admitted
the light, and a chimney of brick,
well burnt, and neatly arranged, peeped
over the roof. As I approached I heard
the voice of children, and the hum of a
spinning-wheel.
I cannot make thee conceive the
delight which was afforded me by all
these tokens. I now found myself, indeed,
among beings like myself, and from whom
hospitable entertainment might be
confidently
expected. I compassed the house,
and made my appearance at the door.
A good woman, busy at her wheel,
with two children playing on the ground
before her, were the objects that now
presented themselves. The uncouthness
of my garb, my wild and weather-worn
appearance, my fusil and tom-hawk,
could not but startle them. The woman
stopt her wheel, and gazed as if a spectre
had started into view.
I was somewhat aware of these
consequences
,
and endeavoured to elude
them, by assuming an air of supplication
and humility. I told her that I was a
traveller, who had unfortunately lost his
way, and had rambled in this wild till
nearly famished for want. I intreated
her to give me some food; any thing
however scanty or coarse, would be
acceptable
.
After some pause she desired me,
though not without some marks of fear,
to walk in. She placed before me some
brown bread and milk. She eyed me
while I eagerly devoured this morsel.
It was, indeed, more delicious than any
I had ever tasted. At length she broke
silence, and expressed her astonishment
and commiseration at my seemingly
forlorn
state, adding, that perhaps I was
the man whom the men were looking
after who had been there some hours
before.
My curiosity was roused by this
intimation
.
In answer to my interrogations,
she said, that three persons had lately
stopped, to inquire if her husband had
not met, within the last three days, a
person of whom their description seemed
pretty much to suit my person and dress.
He was tall, slender, wore nothing but
shirt and trowsers, and was wounded on
the cheek.
What, I asked, did they state the
rank or condition of the person to be?
He lived in Solebury. He was
supposed to have rambled in the
mountains
,
and to have lost his way, or to
have met with some mischance. It was
three days since he had disappeared, but
had been seen, by some one, the last
night, at Deb's hut.
What and where was Deb's hut?
It was a hut in the wilderness,
occupied
by an old Indian woman, known
among her neighbours by the name of
Old Deb. Some people called her
Queen Mab. Her dwelling was eight
long
miles from this house.
A thousand questions were
precluded
,
and a thousand doubts solved
by this information.
Queen Mab
were
sounds familiar to my ears; for they
originated with myself.
This woman originally belonged to
the tribe of Delawares or Lennilennapee.
All these districts were once comprised
within the dominions of that nation.
About thirty years ago, in consequence
of perpetual encroachments of the
English
colonists, they abandoned their
ancient
seats and retired to the banks of
the Wabash and Muskingum.
This emigration was concerted in a
general council of the tribe, and obtained
the concurrence of all but one female.
Her birth, talents, and age, gave her
much consideration and authority among
her countrymen; and all her zeal and
eloquence were exerted to induce them
to lay aside their scheme. In this,
however
,
she could not succeed. Finding
them refractory, she declared her
resolution
to remain behind, and maintain
possession
of the land which her
countrymen
should impiously abandon.
The village inhabited by this clan
was built upon ground which now
constitutes
my uncle's barn yard and orchard.
On the departure of her countrymen,
this female burnt the empty wigwams
and retired into the fastnesses of
Norwalk
.
She selected a spot suitable for
an Indian dwelling and a small plantation
of maize, and in which she was seldom
liable to interruption and intrusion.
Her only companions were three
dogs, of the Indian or wolf species.
These animals differed in nothing from
their kinsmen of the forest, but in
their attachment and obedience to their
mistress. She governed them with
absolute
sway: they were her servants and
protectors, and attended her person or
guarded her threshold, agreeable to her
directions. She fed them with corn and
VOL. II. Y
they supplied her and themselves with
meat, by hunting squirrels, racoons, and
rabbits.
To the rest of mankind they were
aliens or enemies. They never left the
desert but in company with their
mistress
,
and when she entered a
farmhouse
,
waited her return at a distance.
They would suffer none to approach
them, but attacked no one who did not
imprudently crave their acquaintance,
or who kept at a respectful distance
from their wigwam. That sacred asylum
they would not suffer to be violated, and
no stranger could enter it but at the
imminent
hazard of his life, unless
accompanied
and protected by their dame.
The chief employment of this woman,
when at home, besides plucking the weeds
from among her corn; bruising the grain
between two stones, and setting her
snares, for rabbits and apossums, was to
talk. Though in solitude, her tongue was
never at rest but when she was asleep; but
her conversation was merely addressed to
her dogs. Her voice was sharp and shrill,
and her gesticulations were vehement
and grotesque. An hearer would
naturally
imagine that she was scolding; but,
in truth, she was merely giving them
directions. Having no other object of
contemplation or subject of discourse,
she always found, in their postures and
looks, occasion for praise, or blame, or
command. The readiness with which
they understood, and the docility with
which they obeyed her movements and
words, were truly wonderful.
If a stranger chanced to wander near
her hut, and overhear her jargon,
incessant
as it was, and shrill, he might
speculate
in vain on the reason of these sounds.
If he waited in expectation of hearing
some reply, he waited in vain. The
strain, always voluble and sharp, was
never intermitted for a moment, and
would continue for hours at a time.
She seldom left the hut but to visit the
neighbouring inhabitants, and demand
from them food and cloathing, or
whatever
her necessities required. These
were exacted as her due: to have her
wants supplied was her prerogative, and
to withhold what she claimed was
rebellion
.
She conceived that by remaining
behind her countrymen she succeeded
to the government, and retained the
possession
of all this region. The English
were aliens and sojourners, who
occupied
the land merely by her connivance
and permission, and whom she allowed
to remain on no terms but those of
supplying
her wants.
Being a woman aged and harmless,
her demands being limited to that of
which she really stood in need, and
which her own industry could not
procure
,
her pretensions were a subject of
mirth and good humour, and her
injunctions
obeyed with seeming deference
and gravity. To me she early became
an object of curiosity and speculation.
I delighted to observe her habits and
humour her prejudices. She frequently
came to my uncle's house, and I
sometimes
visited her; insensibly she seemed
to contract an affection for me, and
regarded me with more complacency
and condescension than any other
received
.
She always disdained to speak
English
,
and custom had rendered her
intelligible
to most in her native language,
with regard to a few simple questions. I
had taken some pains to study her jargon,
and could make out to discourse with
her on the few ideas which she possessed.
VOL. II. Y
This circumstance, likewise, wonderfully
prepossessed her in my favour.
The name by which she was
formerly
known was Deb; but her
pretensions
to royalty, the wildness of her
aspect and garb, her shrivelled and
diminutive
form, a constitution that seemed to
defy the ravages of time and the influence
of the elements; her age, which some did
not scruple to affirm exceeded an
hundred
years, her romantic solitude and
mountainous haunts suggested to my
fancy the appellation of
Queen Mab
.
There appeared to me some rude analogy
between this personage and her whom
the poets of old-time have delighted to
celebrate; thou perhaps wilt discover
nothing but incongruities between them,
but, be that as it may, Old Deb and
Queen Mab soon came into
indiscriminate
and general use.
She dwelt in Norwalk upwards of
twenty years. She was not forgotten
by her countrymen, and generally
received
from her brothers and sons an
autumnal visit; but no solicitations or
entreaties could prevail on her to return
with them. Two years ago, some
suspicion
or disgust induced her to forsake
her ancient habitation, and to seek a
new one. Happily she found a more
convenient habitation twenty miles to the
westward, and in a spot abundantly
sterile and rude.
This dwelling was of logs, and had
been erected by a Scottish emigrant,
who not being rich enough to purchase
land, and entertaining a passion for
solitude
and independence, cleared a field
in the unappropriated wilderness, and
subsisted on its produce. After some
time he disappeared. Various
conjectures
were formed as to the cause of his
absence. None of them were
satisfactory
;
but that which obtained most credit
was, that he had been murdered by the
Indians, who, about the same period,
paid their annual visit to the
Queen
. This
conjecture acquired some force, by
observing
that the old woman shortly after
took possession of his hut, his
implements
of tillage, and his corn-field.
She was not molested in her new
abode, and her life passed in the same
quiet tenour as before. Her periodical
rambles, her regal claims, her guardian
wolves, and her uncouth volubility, were
equally remarkable, but her circuits were
new. Her distance made her visits to
Solebury more rare, and had prevented
me from ever extending my pedestrian
excursions to her present abode.
These recollections were now
suddenly
called up by the information of
my hostess. The hut where I had
sought shelter and relief was, it seems,
the residence of Queen Mab. Some
fortunate
occurrence had called her away
during my visit. Had she and her dogs
been at home, I should have been set
upon by these ferocious centinels, and,
before their dame could have interfered,
have been, together with my helpless
companion, mangled or killed. These
animals never barked, I should have
entered unaware of my danger, and my
fate could scarcely have been averted by
my fusil.
Her absence at this unseasonable
hour was mysterious. It was now the
time of year when her countrymen were
accustomed to renew their visit. Was
there a league between her and the
plunderers
whom I had encountered?
But who were they by whom my
foot-steps were so industriously traced?
Those whom I had seen at Deb's hut
were strangers to me, but the wound
upon my face was known only to them.
To this circumstance was now added
my place of residence and name. I
supposed them impressed with the belief
that I was dead; but this mistake must
have speedily been rectified. Revisiting
the spot, finding me gone, and obtaining
some intelligence of my former condition,
they had instituted a search after me.
But what tidings were these? I was
supposed to have been bewildered in
the mountains, and three days were said
to have passed since my disappearance.
Twelve hours had scarcely elapsed since
I emerged from the cavern. Had two
days and an half been consumed in my
subterranean prison?
These reflections were quickly
supplanted
by others. I now gained a
sufficient
acquaintance with the region that
was spread around me. I was in the
midst of a vale, included between ridges
that gradually approached each other,
and when joined, were broken up into
hollows and steeps, and spreading
themselves
over a circular space, assumed
the appellation of Norwalk. This vale
gradually widened as it tended to the
westward, and was, in this place ten
or twelve miles in breadth. My devious
foot-steps had brought me to the foot of
the southern barrier. The outer basis
of this was laved by the river, but, as
it tended eastward, the mountain and
river receded from each other, and one
of the cultivable districts lying between
them was Solebury, my natal
township
.
Hither it was now my duty to return
with the utmost expedition.
There were two ways before me.
One lay along the interior base of the
hill, over a sterile and trackless space, and
exposed to the encounter of savages,
some of whom might possibly be lurking
here. The other was the well frequented
road, on the outside and along the river,
and which was to be gained by passing
over this hill. The practicability of the
passage was to be ascertained by
inquiries
made to my hostess. She pointed
out a path that led to the rocky summit
and down to the river's brink. The path
was not easy to be kept in view or to be
trodden, but it was undoubtedly to be
preferred to any other.
A route, somewhat circuitous, would
terminate in the river road.
Thenceforward
the way to Solebury was level
and direct; but the whole space which I
had to traverse was not less than thirty
miles. In six hours it would be night,
and, to perform the journey in that time
would demand the agile boundings of a
leopard and the indefatigable sinews of
an elk.
My frame was in miserable plight.
My strength had been assailed by
anguish
,
and fear, and watchfulness; by
toil, and abstinence, and wounds. Still,
however, some remnant was left; would
it not enable me to reach my home by
night-fall? I had delighted, from my
childhood, in feats of agility and
perseverance
.
In roving through the maze
of thickets and precipices, I had put my
energis both moral and physical,
frequently
to the test. Greater
achievements
than this had been performed,
and I disdained to be out-done in
perspicacity
by the lynx, in his sure-footed
instinct by the roe, or in patience under
hardship, and contention with fatigue,
by the Mohawk. I have ever aspired
to transcend the rest of animals in all that
is common to the rational and brute, as
well as in all by which they are
distinguished
from each other.
