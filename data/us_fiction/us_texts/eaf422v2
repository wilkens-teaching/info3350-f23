CHAPTER XXXIV.
THE SURRENDER.
If nothing more than purpose in thine power,
Thy purpose firm is equal to the deed;
Who does the best his circumstance allows,
Does well, acts noblyangels could no more.
Young
.
The
rocky precipice which now sheltered
these few hardy gleanings of so many
desperate
fights, was within a few paces of the river's
margin; but not a boat was there to receive them.
In this extremely painful situation they remained
many minutes, when they found themselves
suddenly
surrounded by more than five times their
number; and knowing that a further resistance
would produce an useless effusion of blood, they
reluctantly complied with their leader's advice,
who sighed in the performance of what had now
become a necessary duty, for the prevention of a
greater sacrifice. They threw down their arms
in sullen despondency, which Scott, with a
graceful
dignity peculiar to himself, tendered his sword
to his more fortunate opponent.
Wadsworth, who, with his faithful followers,
had been a sharer in the dangers and glory of five
victorious conflicts, was also compelled to
participate
in the reverses of the day. The remaining
militia under his command, amounting to one
hundred
and fifty men, relinquished their well-tried
arms to the enemy, and became prisoners of
war.
After the surrender, an Indian advanced to
Scott, surveyed him very attentively for some
time, and then addressed himYou are not
born to be shot. So many times(holding up
all the fingers of both hands, to count ten)so
many times have I levelled and fired my rifle at
you. Scott was in full uniform, and being
remarkable
for his stature, was evidently a fair
mark for a sharp-shooter.
Under the rocks and fissures of the precipice,
were upwards of one hundred militia, whose
constitutional
scruples
had been so far overcome as to
permit them to cross the river, but they had not
ventured to ascend the precipice, or appear in
sight of the enemy! What a mortifying discovery
must this have been to those brave fellows who
had now sought shelter there, almost exhausted
with fatigue, from a contest of eleven hours with
no ordinary enemy, either for numbers or
courage
!
I sincerely lament that the duty of a
faithful
historian compels me to record this fact. But
to return.
During the short cessation of slaughter which
succeeded the fall of Brock and the dispersion of
26*
his followers, the wounded received such
attentions
as situation and circumstances would
permit
.
The bullet which had entered the thigh of
ensign Willoughby, was easily extracted on the
opposite side, it having glanced the bone, and
passed almost through; when, as soon as the
bleeding was stanched, he insisted on resuming
his former position in the line, where he
continued
during two furious assaults of the enemy, who
was defeated in each. In the third, however,
which terminated the contest, George had become
so exhausted with fatigue and loss of blood, that
he fainted a moment before the Americans gave
way, and fell among a promiscuous heap of
friends and foes, who had met in the arms of
death.
When he recovered his recollection, a gigantic
savage was standing over him, rifling the pockets
of his coat, which had been stripped from his
body. In a moment the miniature of Catharine
caught his eyeit had been torn from his neck,
and was now suspended at the Indian's girdle.
Our hero took no time for reflection, but starting
on his feet, seized the unguarded and astonished
savage by the throat, and threw him on the
ground, where he was just on the point of
regaining
his lost treasure, when his arm was arrested,
and he found himself surrounded by a dozen
more, with suspended tomahawks, and looks less
expressive of vengeance than of wonder, at his
daring temerity.
Knowing that he must now, in all human
probability
,
fall a sacrifice to their fury, he only
thought of selling his life as dearly as possible.
But he was unarmed; the bandage had broken
loose from his wound, which was bleeding afresh,
and he felt that his newly-recovered strength was
rapidly declining. He looked round upon his
enemies in despair, and again sank nerveless on
the ground.
Two of the savages immediately raised him,
and after venting a fiend-like laugh at their fallen
comrade, each seized an arm of our hero, and
forced him along between them through the scene
of carnage which the hill presented. Here many
of these merciless monsters were engaged in
stripping and scalping the dying and the slain.
George recognised the lifeless bodies of several
of his friends, stripped even of their linen,
scalped
,
and horribly mangled; some, who had only
received a shot-wound in the limbs, and had
fallen
through weakness, now presented scalpless
sculls cloven entirely in two by the hatchets of
these barbarous wretches. He shuddered at the
contemplation of a fate which his sudden
recovery
had certainly deferredperhaps wholly
averted.
They descended the western declivity of the
hill, and George was delivered into the hands of
the English. He could have thanked the savages
for their unexpected clemency, but the jewel of
which they had rifled him suddenly darted across
his recollection, and he exclaimed, in a tone of
frenzyMonsters! restore me my treasure!
His exclamation, however, excited no attention;
and he was consigned to the care of a surgeon,
after receiving a very flattering encomium from
the British officers for his conspicuous bravery
during the active duties of the day. It gives me
pleasure to add, upon the best authority, that the
treatment which the wounded prisoners received
from the English officers and surgeons on this
occasion
,
was marked with proper delicacy,
tenderness
,
and respect.
CHAPTER XXXV.
AN EVENING IN BOSTON.
As softest metals are not slow to melt,
So pity soonest runs in gentle minds.
Dryden
.
The
blustering van of Winter's advancing
forces pressed hard upon the rear of retreating
Autumn, whose yellow plumes and banners had
already disappeared from the frost-crusted plains
of New-England, and were waving in more
southern
climes. The pioneers of the frigid tyrant
had stripped the fields of herbage, wasted the
meadows, and covered every stream with a
crystalline bridge. It was a boisterous evening
in the month of November, and the streets of
Boston were covered with rain and sleet, when a
happy little party, around Orville's parlour fire,
were suddenly thrown into consternation by the
heart-appalling cry of
murder!
almost
immediately
under the window. Orville and Morse flew
into the street, and at their approach three
ruffians
took to their heels, and effected their
escape
,
leaving their bleeding victim prostrate in
the gutter.
He lives! exclaimed Morse, raising the
poor wretch's head upon his knee, while he felt
the blood gushing on his hand; Heaven grant
that his scull be not fractured.
I hope not, returned Orville, as he assisted
in lifting him from the ground; a surgeon must
be instantly called.
Lights were now brought, but scarcely any
symptoms of life were discernable in the object
of their care, whom they now discovered to be a
sailor, whose sun-burnt countenance was
marked
with many an honest scar. He was
immediately
conveyed into the house, and laid on a sofa,
while Morse departed for a surgeon, and Ellen
assisted Amelia in washing the clotted blood from
his temples, and cutting the gory locks from
a wound on the side of his head. In a short time
he recovered so far as to swallow a cordial, and
express his gratitude for the kind attention of his
fair nurses; he complained of an excruciating
pain in the left hip, which he feared had been
dislocated
in the fall, as he felt it impossible to
move.
The surgeon now entered with Morse, and
having
examined the patient, found a severe
contusion
on his hip, which was much swelled and
inflamed
;
but neither fracture nor dislocation had
been produced. The wounds were then
properly
dressed, the necessary medicines
administered
,
and the grateful tar conveyed to a chamber
hastily prepared for his reception, where a
faithful
domestic was directed to watch by him during
the night.
Having thus assisted in performing the sacred
rites of humanity, Amelia and Morse were
preparing
to depart, when a rattling peal from the
knocker arrested their attention, and in the next
moment George Washington Willoughby was
locked in his sister's arms.
It was some time before the mutual rapture of
this unexpected meeting could be articulated in
words, or expressed in any other way than by
tears and unfinished exclamations. A more
tranquil
joy, however, succeeded, and their
reciprocal
inquiries were made and answered in a more
intelligible manner. At length the whole party
became composed, and took seats around the
social
hearth. Refreshments were introduced, and
Ellen resuming a tone of gaiety peculiar to
herself
,
exclaimed
But tell us, my hero George, to what
miracle
do we owe the happiness of this meeting; and
who is the adventurous knight that has again
unriveted
your fetters, and restored you to the arms
of friendship, liberty, and love?
I have returned on parole, my gay cousin,
and am doomed to renounce the service of Mars
until a British ensign can be found on this side
the lines, to break the spell of honor which binds
me. Did my sister receive a letter from
Queenston
?
I did, answered Amelia, and we were all
extremely happy that its contents furnished no
grounds to support the rumor of your having
been wounded in that unfortunate affair.
Knowing that your affectionate fears would
aggravate a mere scratch to something more
serious
and alarming, I forebore to mention it, and
was soon able to walk, when we were all
conducted
to Quebec as prisoners of war. Before
I left Queenston, I recovered the trinket
mentioned
in my letter as having been stolen by an
Indian, and it is to the generous interference of
a British officer that I am indebted for its
restoration
.
At Quebec, the brave Scott obtained his
parole, as did several others, among whom I was
one. We embarked in a cartel, and without any
accident arrived in this port a few hours since.
I have only been landed long enough to drop a
how d'ye at my uncle's, and flew immediately
hither. And now, tell me something of my
father
.
Who has heard from him?
I have this day received a long letter from
him, answered Morse, which you shall read
in due time.
And Amelia has also received a long letter
from
her
wild correspondent, added Ellen, with
an arch smile; but it contains no mysterious
postscript, and consequently you can possess no
curiosity to see it.
George turned an eager beseeching look on his
sister, and exclaimedTell me, Amelia, how
fares mymy father?
Our friends
at
and
near
Mulberry-Grove, are
all well, replied his sister; male and female
old and young. Let that content you until
to-morrow
.
In the mean time, permit me to
introduce
to your acquaintance a relation whom you
have never seen. So saying, she rose, and led
her brother to a recess where stood a cradle, in
which a beautiful infant was sleeping. There,
she continued, lies your little cousin, George
Cushing Orville, who has this day completed two
months of life's little pilgrimage.
George took the infant in his arms, raised
its soft cheek to his lips, and after caressing it for
a few minutes, returned it to the cradle; then
casting an inquiring look at his sister, said
Perhaps there is also another little stranger who
may be still more nearly related to me.
Short-sighted simpleton! cried Ellen; but
before he could ask an explanation, a servant
burst into the room, with a countenance in which
terror and alarm were strongly depicted, and
begged that one of the gentlemen would hasten
up stairs, and endeavour to quiet the wounded
sailor, who was raving like a madman. Orville
and Morse immediately ascended to the chamber,
and without pausing to make any inquiries, our
hero darted after them.
Shall we follow? said Amelia, advancing
to the door.
Not for the world, answered Ellen; who
could answer for the consequences of such a
scene on the delicate nerves of one who is
as
women wish to be who love their lords?
If
feminine
assistance is necessary, I will go by
myself
.
When the three gentlemen entered the sick
man's chamber, they found their patient sitting
up in bed, with clenched fists, and eyes rolling
in wild frenzy, swearing to annihilate a host of
enemies, whom he imagined were ready to assail
him. Fortunately he did not mistake his real
friends. Come on, shipmates! he exclaimed,
as they approached the bed; I've wing'd the
lieutenant. Cut down that lubber! Follow up
the blow!down with 'em!Never submit to a
tyrannical press-gang!They give way!press
on!Victory!huzza! On finishing this
strange rhapsody, (which was very thickly
interlarded
with coarse oaths and other
technical
phraseology
)
he made a desperate effort to leap out of
bed, but was caught by our hero, and sank
exhausted
in his arms. His whole frame glowed,
and his burning hands and face seemed ready to
burst with the fever that raged in his veins.
Being again laid on his pillow, he was quiet
for some minutes, and in that interval George
was made acquainted with the adventure which
had introduced the poor sufferer under this
hospitable
roof.
Scarcely was the brief recital finished, when
its subject again started; but his eyes now
continued
closed, and without rising from his pillow,
or using any extravagant gestures, he pursued
another theme, in broken sentences, and in a
much lower tone:
Hist! Now is the timethe darknesshe's
not an owlhe can't see the mainmasthist!
one at a timechicken-hearted lubber! the
sharks are on boardshiver my timbers if I back
out!Now for itAh! ah! comfortable
comfortable
.
He was again silent, and every muscle seemed
to labor in some arduous exercise. Great drops
of sweat started from every pore, and he began
to breathe more easy; his full high-bounding
pulse began gradually to subside, and in less than
an hour he awoke with no delirium, and quite free
from fever.
Having received a draught of some cooling
medicine from the hand of Orville, he again
expressed
his thanks for such kindness to a
stranger
,
and regretted that he had become so
troublesome
.
Orville entreated him to give himself no
uneasiness on that score; and perceiving that he
was disposed to sleep, recommended him to the
particular care of the attendant, and descended
to the parlour, where the happy party separated
for the night.
In the course of the following day the sailor
found himself so much better, that he was able
27
to sit up and converse freely; when, at the
request
of his humane host, he related all that he
knew respecting the fracas which had reduced
him to the perilous situation from which he had
been so providentially extricated.
He had just been paid off and discharged from
a merchant ship that had lately arrived from
France, and was proceeding to his lodgings,
when he observed that he was closely followed
by two or three suspicious-looking fellows,
armed
with heavy sticks. Being unconscious of
having
deserved an enemy, he naturally concluded,
that if he was the object of their pursuit, it must
be for the purpose of robbing him of his
hard-earned
money. He turned several corners, and
they still continued to dog him, until he
concluded
to make a stand and demand the cause of this
singular pursuit. Instead of answering his
inquiry
,
they seized him by the throat, and
endeavoured
to stop his mouth with a handkerchief.
By a desperate struggle, however, he disengaged
himself from their grasp; and finding escape
impossible
,
cried out murder. He could recollect
no more, until he found himself on the sofa,
attended
by the ladies. Both the pockets of his
jacket were turned inside out; but fortunately he
had secured his money in a morocco purse, which
was concealed in the facing of his vest; and the
timely interference of Orville and Morse had
prevented
a further search.
In the mean time, our hero had been
devouring
the contents of his sister's letter from
Catharine
,
in which she had ingenuously confessed to
Amelia the present state of her affections, with
an artless little history of the rise and progress
of a passion which she esteemed the happiness of
her life. The catastrophe at Richmond was not
forgotten; the meeting in the meadow was
delicately
painted; and their subsequent
engagements
,
and parting interview, accurately
described
.
What a treat for a lover!
Did I not know you so well, my brother,
said Amelia, as she gave him the letter, did I
not believe your bosom to be the seat of the
purest honor, I would not expose you to the
intoxicating
influence of this cordial. Prove
yourself
worthy of so sacred a trust.
The concluding paragraph of this letter I have
been permitted to transcribe, and is in the
following
words:
But O, my dear friend! after confiding so
much to the sanctity of your breast, how will you
believe me, when I assure you that poor
Catharine
is still unhappy? Think me not childish or
capriciousbut how can I feel happy when the
hazardous profession which this angelic being
has chosen may, in one fatal moment, blast my
little paradise of hope, and render all the world
to me a dreary desert of misery? How soon may
that manly form lie bleeding on the cold ground,
and those lovely limbs be mangled by trampling
horses, or hewed to pieces by the still more
merciless
savages. A bullet or a sword may pierce
that generous heart which throbs with the noblest
ardor for his country, and the purest affection for
his friends. This is the only reflection that can
ever shake my implicit trust in the providence of
Heaven. I fear, Ameliaindeed I fear, that such
a trial of my strength would find me sadly
deficient
.
Pray for me, that I may never encounter
it. Foolish, selfish girl! to forget that I am
addressing
the sister of
such
a brother! Let us then
mingle our prayers to avert an event, the effects
of which would be so fatally extensive.
To be worthy of such affection, said
George, as he returned the letter to Amelia,
shall be the study of my life; and never can I
be sufficiently grateful to my sister for her
generous
confidence. Did the dear writer of that
epistle know the happiness that has been thus
clandestinely imparted to her absent friend, she
would surely overlook the means, and excuse the
agent.
I would not willingly put her friendship to
the test, answered Amelia; so enjoy your
happiness
,
but forget the medium through which you
received it.
The light-hearted George now endeavored to
collect his thoughts for a perusal of his father's
letter to Morse, which the reader will find
recorded
at large in the next chapter.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
THE LETTER.
Can we call conquest ours?
Shall man, this pigmy, with a giant's pride,
Vaunt of himself, and say
thus have I done this?
O vain pretence to greatness! Like the moon,
We borrow all the brightness which we boast;
Dark in ourselves, and useless. If that hand
That rules the fate of battles, strike for us,
Crown us with fame, and gild our clay with honor,
'Twere most ungrateful to disown the benefit,
And arrogate a pride that is not ours.
Rowe's Tam
.
Mulberry-Grove, Ohio
,
October
22, 1812.
Your
last, my son, is now before me, and
every sentence yields me pleasure, except that in
which you mention Amelia's fears on my account.
Assure her from me, that the moment any real
cause of alarm presents itself, I shall not be
backward
in providing for the safety of myself and
those under my protection. It grieves me that
she should make herself unhappy in anticipating
evils that may never arrive. Let me intreat her,
through you, to banish every fear for the safety
of her father, and repose her trust in that
merciful
Being who, in the operations of his
providence
,
never permits an evil to take place but for
the ultimate good of his creatures; and it is our
duty to submit without a murmur. I do not wish
it to be understood that the ordinary human
means of shunning an impending danger are to
be neglected: so far from it, I should conceive
that I was tempting the Almighty, to remain in a
place of danger, when I could retreat
consistently
with duty. I repeat, that I will remove from
Mulberry-Grove the moment I apprehend any
27*
danger from staying. Were it a tenable fortress,
the case would be different. Let this assurance
restore peace to the bosom of my child.
I have just received an account of the
unprofitable
contest at Queenston, and I lament to
add, that your brother George is again a prisoner
of war. A letter from Lewiston assures me that
my noble boy behaved in a very gallant manner
throughout the whole affair, and this in some
measure
reconciles me to his renewed captivity. I
received a letter from him while at Buffalo,
giving
an account of the fortunate enterprize which
restored him to liberty, with above thirty others,
only five days before the Queenston affair; but
as you must already be in possession of the
particulars
,
perhaps from his own pen, I shall pass
them over unnoticed.
You wish me to continue a regular detail
of war events on the western frontier. Indeed,
you enjoin on me a hard task; for the situation of
Mulberry-Grove is not the most eligible for a
political
observatory. I am sometimes indebted to
a Boston newspaper for accounts of events
passing
in this state. But I will comply with your
request
as far as practicable, and give you a brief
account of every interesting occurrence in the
order I receive them.
On the nineteenth of September, general
Harrison, pursuant to orders from the war
department
,
relinquished the command of the
Northwestern
army to brigadier-general Winchester, a
gentleman of great respectability and merit, but
who does not appear to possess the confidence of
the Kentuckians like Harrison. Great discontent
and murmuring were produced among the troops
when they were informed of the change; but on
being addressed by Harrison, they appeared
better
satisfied. An express from the seat of
government
,
however, has since reached him, with
dispatches from the same department, appointing
him to the command of all the troops which have
been called into service from the western states.
He has, therefore, again taken the command of
the Northwestern army, and, it is expected, will
immediately adopt the most efficient measures to
regain Detroit and proceed into Upper Canada.
Among the volunteers from Kentucky, now
under Harrison, are the following members of
congress: Samuel Hopkins, major-general;
Richard
M. Johnson, commanding a battalion of
mounted rangers; John Simpson, captain;
William
P. Duval, captain; Samuel M`Kee, private;
Thomas Montgomery, private. To the honor of
that patriotic state, I can also add, that numbers
of the most wealthy and respectable private
citizens
are in the ranks, who endure all the
privations
necessarily attendant on a military life, with
a degree of subordination never exceeded by
regular
troops.
During the attack on Fort Wayne by the
Indians
,
mentioned in my last, it is said that the
commander, captain Rhea, proposed to
surrender
;
but his subalterns threatened to put him to
instant death if he made the proposition again.
It was supposed he intended to surrender the fort
and make his escape to Detroit. The moment
general Harrison arrived, captain Rhea was
arrested
,
and given liberty to resign, or to stand his
trial. He chose the former. The firmness of
these officers, no doubt, saved the garrison from
indiscriminate massacre.
Some particulars respecting another
expedition
against that post, have just come to my
knowledge
.
About the middle of September, two
Indians
arrived at Detroit with a letter, which they
found on an express whom they had intercepted
and killed, and which had been sent by the
commander
of Fort Wayne to general Harrison,
requesting
succors, and stating that his situation
was critical. The British commander, on the
receipt
of the letter, immediately sent about
one
thousand Indians
, who had arrived at Detroit
since its surrender, with a few regulars, to attack
the fort; who proceeded until they came within
sixteen miles of an American army, which they
learned, from a prisoner their spies took, to be
Harrison's. They then precipitately retreated,
leaving much of their ammunition, &c. on the
ground.
Harrison, I understand, is now employing
himself with the greatest zeal, in arranging
depots
of provisions, clothing, and ammunition;
opening roads, building boats, erecting
block-houses
,
&c. preparatory to his march to the
borders
,
whither he shortly proposes to proceed.
Several of the Miami and other Indians have
come in to him, and thrown themselves on the
mercy of the government, agreeing to abide by
the decision of the president in relation to them,
whatever that may be.
The accounts from Detroit are not very
agreeable; almost every day furnishes instances
of dishonorable conduct in British officers, who
openly and shamefully violate the articles of
capitulation
.
The inhabitants are daily plundered
of their private property, and robbed of every
thing to which their haughty oppressors take a
liking. But the barbarities of the Indians are
shocking beyond belief; even the sanctity of the
tomb is violated, and dead bodies have been
unearthed
and stripped of their scalps, which these
unprincipled wretches have then sold to their
more unprincipled employers; thus at once
robbing
the dead and cheating the living! The
British
have almost disrobed Detroit of every thing
valuable, and carried it within their lines. They
have no expectation of being able to hold the
place, and are therefore removing the cannon and
ammunition. The fort is now garrisoned by one
hundred British regulars.
I can now positively and safely contradict
the report that I hinted at in my last, of the
defeat
and massacre of a detachment from general
Perkins' command at the river Huron. The
circumstances
,
which I have since learned, and
which may be depended upon, are as follows:
General Perkins had detached captain Cotton,
with a party of ninety men, to the peninsula of
Sandusky, to secure some salt said to be there.
On the arrival of the party, they discovered some
Indians, whom they immediately attacked; the
Indians retired until they were joined by another
party, when a brisk fight took place; and had it
not been for some misunderstanding of the orders,
it is probable the whole of the Indians would
have been killed or taken, as the Americans had
outflanked and nearly surrounded them. It is,
however, satisfactory to add, that the Indians
were beaten; and, though the number killed
could not be correctly ascertained, there is no
doubt but their loss greatly exceeded ours, which
was six killed and ten wounded, none of them
dangerously. Captain Cotton has returned to
camp.
Captain Elliott is making great exertions to
secure the command of Lake Erie, for the
attainment
of which important object a great number
of ship-carpenters are put in requisition. May
Heaven crown their labors with success, and
make them instrumental in restoring a speedy
peace.
You request some further observations on
the subject of war, and seem not to be entirely
satisfied with my attempts to reconcile it with
religion
.
Perhaps you do not sufficiently keep in
view the ground on which I found my argument
viz.
the present degenerate state of man
. Evil
is
in the world; how it gained a footing here, does
not belong to the present subject. It is sufficient
for my purpose to know, that all the operations
of Providence tend to its removal; it was for this
purpose alone that revelation was given, and it is
for this purpose alone that wars, pestilences,
famines
,
&c. are permitted to ravage the earth.
There never were but two ways or methods
by which the operations of Providence have been
carried on: the one by extraordinary, the other by
ordinary means; the former may be termed
miracles
the
latter, natural occurrences. Miracles
have long since ceased, because they interfere
with the free will of man, forcing an
acquiesence
from the understanding, without reforming
his heart. The only possible manner, then, in
which evil can be gradually removed from the
world, (consistently with that freedom of will
which makes us men) is by spiritual
instruments;
and, as it would be out of order for good spirits to
be employed in such dirty work, and as evil
spirits
always stand ready to do such work, the
Almighty
permits them, under proper restraints, to
stir up nation against nationset the great
cauldron
boiling, and take the scum for their trouble.
But you will ask, if the removal of evil is all
that is intended in the permission of wars,
pestilences
,
famines, and the rest, how happens it that
the good suffer equally with the bad?
To this I answerThe good are permitted
to be thus afflicted in order to make them still
better
,
by increasing their patience, humility, and
dependence on Heaven. And when they are
finally removed from this life by one of these
same
instruments
, they enter into a state of
never-ending
felicity, where these instruments can no
more reach them or afflict them. With the
wilfully
wicked the case is different; by permitting
them to be cut off, the hereditary love of evil
which they derived from their parents, (and which,
instead of combatting and subduing, they have
increased by unrestrained indulgence) is thus
arrested
and prevented from descending to a
numerous
progeny, who might in their turn
transmit
the accumulated load to the next generation,
until the world would be again reduced to that
state which once caused its destruction by a
deluge
.
But, admitting all this, you may then ask
How can good men conscientiously assist in this
work of devils, for the performance of which
there are, alas! too many instruments instigated
by passions altogether suitable for the diabolical
employment?
This brings us to the main point of the
subject
,
and will lead me to notice a very nice
distinction
.
No good man can, conscientiously and
voluntarily
,
take up arms in an
offensive
war, unless
he do so to prevent the still greater evil of
disobeying
those in authority, (which we are
expressly
forbidden by religion to do) and thereby
promote civil dissentions. But in a war
altogether
defensive
, like the one in which we are now
engaged, every good man, I believe, may safely
take a part, and do so from the purest motives. I
must insist upon it, that in our present low state
of goodness, means correspondingly low must be
resorted to, to defend our just and unalienable
rights. Were we without sin, other means would
doubtless be provided by Providence; as we are
not, we have no right to expect them. It is
surely
justifiable self-defence to strike a weapon from
the hand of an assailant; or, if that weapon is
raised against us, to strike off the arm that wields
it. Canada is that armthe Indian scalping
knife is the weapon it wields. If we cannot
repel
the weapon, let us attempt to cut off the arm.
I have already given you the substance of a
conversation I once had on this subject with
general
Brown, before he had entirely discarded
the prejudices of the sect in whose tenets he was
educated. He was then a quaker, and I believe
a most excellent man; nor is he the less so for
being now in the field, ready to chastise the
enemies
of freedom. It is possible that some
people
might draw from that conversation a mistaken
inference, and imagine that I was combatting
the principle of peace itself, when I was only
contending against the enthusiastic delusions
which men have fallen into by mistaking the
genuine
sense and meaning of our religion. If a
Millenium is ever to bless the world, or the
Saturnian
age to return, I am confident that it will
not be brought about exclusively by Quakers;
it must be effected by a radical change and
reform
in the heads and hearts of mankind. When
such a reform becomes so extensive as to find its
way into our political bodies, its effects will be
exhibited in the sphere of politics. Politicians
will then forget all party distinctions, and the
friends of peace will discard that enthusiasm
which assumes credit for ideal virtues that
cannot
be practised. They will be men on a
proper
level with the business of the world in which
they live, and, therefore, Christians, truly sane
and efficient.
The Quakers all profess to be the disciples
of
Peace
; and, in order not to be mistaken by
the world on this point, have assumed a peculiar
garb, speech, and manners. But is it not highly
probable that many among them may be merely
externally
friends; men who indulge their
unbridled
passions in the political contests around
them, their bosoms burning like a fiery furnace,
with every malignant and furious passion that is
common to the wicked? If there are such, what
will the external garb of peace avail them, while
they have no peace within? What can avail the
cut of their coat, the nicety of their grammar, or
the peculiarity of their calendar? To such I would
say, Assume the military uniform of your
country
;
in that character you may become useful;
let your furious passions, your subtle selfish
cunning
,
operate against the open enemies of your
country, rather than expend their malignant
influence
on your neighbors and fellow-citizens. Ye
are cut-throats internallyyou may as well be
so externally: your damnation would not be
more certain.
28
The creed or discipline that gives no
latitude
for the exercise of private judgment, is a
wrong one; for the soul that is panting for war,
should no more be restrained by the discipline of
his sect from taking the field, than one of a
contrary
disposition should be compelled to go into
it. The man who shoulders his musket
conscientiously
,
may be a faithful christian. The man
who cheerfully pays others because he thinks
that they are fitter than himself, by nature or
education
,
for such purpose, may also be a good
christian. The quakers say, he only who resists
not, but trusts to Heaven for protection, is a good
christian.
Whatever be a man's religious or political
creed, if he be honest and peaceable,
uncontroled
by selfish interests, prejudice, and bigotry, an
observer of the golden rule, and a lover of
usefulness
every
good christian ought to hail him
as a brother, whether his coat be
drab
or
scarlet
whether he has conscientiously taken up arms,
or conscientiously refused to take up arms.
The sect of the quakers tacitly declare to all
others,
you must join, or fight for us
. Now, it
may happen, and indeed does actually happen,
that very many do not approve of the creed and
discipline of the quakers; the option then seems
to be rather a hard one, and inconsistent with the
general principles of justice; for if, in order to
avoid war, we go into society, we must violate
conscience; if we do not go in, but go out to war,
we are reprobated as anti-christians, even when
fighting their battles, which they unjustly refuse
to do; so that we appear in a dilemma, from
which there are no means of release but in
breaking
down the creed itself.
When we speak of a man trusting in Heaven
for protection, we should always think of a
protection
according to the proper and regular order
established by law, not in an imaginary state of
things, taking rise in delusions. On this point
we have an excellent lesson from Scripture, where
Satan, by an
affectation
of such a trust, desires
the Redeemer to cast himself from the pinnacle
of the temple; the reply to which should be
always
present to every christian, for it expressly
forbids us thus to
tempt
the Almighty, by any
improper
or eccentric departure from the
established
order even of external or natural things.
The true state of the case is this: when the
necessity for war shall cease, then war will cease,
and not before; for whilst there are bad men to
commit aggressions, the best of men must defend
themselves, and by carnal weapons too, if
necessary
.
A contrary doctrine is just as absurd as
for a shepherd to go home with his dog, and trust
to Providence to protect the sheep, when
surrounded
by wolves.
But I shall trespass on your patience, and
therefore adieu for the present.
EDWARD WILLOUGHBY.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
THE SAILOR'S STORY.
The strange vicissitudes of human fate,
Still altering, never in a steady state;
Good after illand after pain, delight;
Alternate, like the scenes of day and night.
Then since each man who lives is born to die,
And none can boast sincere felicity;
With equal mind, what happens let us bear,
Nor joy nor grieve too much for things beyond our care.
Dryden
.
In
the afternoon our hero visited the wounded
son of Neptune, whom he found sitting up in his
chamber, and apparently much better. He
seized
George by the hand as he approached him,
and requested that he would grant him half an
hour's conversation, if his engagements would
permit. This request was very cheerfully
complied
with.
You see, I am no longer on my beam-ends,
said he, as our hero took a seat by his side;
thanks to the humanity and kindness of those
who made the enemy sheer off, and saved me
from foundering when overpowered and beaten
by superior force. I hope to be refitted and
afloat again in a day or two, when I have it in
contemplation to evince my gratitude in the only
way I can. I owe my life to the humanity of
Americans, and though I can make no suitable
return
to these hospitable individuals in particular,
I may serve them by being a benefit to the nation
at large. I will therefore enter the American
navy, and spend the last drop of my blood in
their service. On this subject I wished to have
your opinion, as I shall be a fellow-laborer with
yourself, though on a different element.
But do you feel no repugnance to taking up
arms against your own country?
I have no country! he returned, with a sigh.
You may perhaps conjecture, from my speech,
that I was born in Ireland, and so I was; but
Ireland has lost its rank among the nations of the
earth; it groans in vassalage, and its inhabitants
are trodden under foot by British tyranny. Ireland
is enslaved, and many Irishmen are compelled to
fight the battles of their oppressorsperdition
seize the scoundrel who does it from choice! I
owe no allegiance to England. If such a tie ever
existed, it was cut with the heart-strings of my
father's family, who met destruction for daring
to express their abhorrence of the tyranny they
could not approve. Many long years of misery
have I dragged out in the service of England,
until an excellent constitution has become
broken
,
and, what is still worse, a noble spirit
debased
the
manners and sentiments of a
gentleman
degraded and contaminated by the vulgar
servile inmates of an English forecastle! You
look surprised, sir.
I am, indeed. You are no common sailor.
I was never designed for one. My father,
(who had two sons and one daughter) was not
rich, but an opulent maternal uncle took the
charge of our education, and spared neither
pains nor expense to render it complete. My
brother graduated at Trinity College, and was
studying law under the immortal Emmett, when
that inflexible patriot raised his hand and voice
in the cause of suffering Ireland. You know the
fate of that godlike man, and most of his
compatriots
my
poor brother's was sealed by the
same merciless cut-throats. My uncle fled; and
his estate was confiscated.
28*
I was then but fourteen years of age, and
just preparing to commence a collegiate course of
studies, when these afflicting events plunged us
all in ruin, reduced my father to beggarybroke
my mother's heart! Young as I was, I felt too
indignant
at these unmerited sufferings to submit in
silence. I spoke my sentiments, and expressed
my hatred of the scorpions that had stung me.
With an idea of pity worthy of the base-minded
parasites of tyranny, they thought to ameliorate
the fate which they said my rashness had
incurred
,
and insultingly told me, that `out of a
tender
regard for my extreme youth, I should only
be punished by serving
for life
in his majesty's
navy!' Damnable clemency! Ten thousand times
rather would I have died on the scaffold with my
brother, in the sacred cause of patriotism, than
have served one hour in their floating hells.
The history of your family, observed
George, bears a strong resemblance to that of
another, whose surviving members are now
residing
in this country, in the state of Ohio.
I know not what became of my father, after
I was dragged from his arms; it is more than
probable that he has followed my mother to the
grave. My sister, thank Heaven, was happily
married to a man whom prudence kept neutral,
though his heart was always with the patriots. I
have not heard a syllable from them since my
incarceration
on board the Majestic, and perhaps
never shall. Bowed down with misery, my
father
was then but the spectre of a mana
walking
shadow; and, though offered an asylum in
the house of his son-in-law, insisted on
supporting
himself by giving lessons on the harp, of
which he was a perfect master.
Can there be such a remarkable
coincidence
?
cried George; or is it possible that
William O'Hara effected his escape from the
Macedonian
at Norfolk?
It was now the sailor's turn to be surprised;
he stared at George some moments, and then
replied
My name
is
William O'Hara, and I
did
escape
from the Macedonian while that frigate was
lying in Hampton Roads, previous to the war.
What became of your companions?
Two of them, I have heard, reached the
shore in safety; while another, with myself, were
picked up by the barge of the revenue-cutter,
which, owing to the darkness of the night, ran
on us before we perceived her approach. The
bargemen cordially congratulated us on our
fortunate
escape, and, on reaching the cutter,
furnished
us with dry clothes and snug births until
morning, when they set us on shore. Being
entirely
destitute of money and clothes, we
immediately
shipped on board the Neptune, which was
taking in a cargo for Bordeaux. But not liking
the captain, I procured my discharge in France,
and went on board a ship just ready to sail for
Boston, and here we arrived last week.
Mysterious Providence! exclaimed George,
who can fathom or comprehend thy wonderful
operations! How many would attribute to chance
what is thus brought about by the unseen agents
of infinite love and wisdom! Yes, my friend, had
it not been for the villainous attack on your life
and property (an event which we all so naturally
lament) and had not the scene of that outrage
been in front of this house, you might never have
met a human being to direct you to the arms of a
sistera niece
What do you tell me?
Your brother-in-law, Fleming, with your
sister
and their daughter, now reside in Ohio,
within
a mile of my father's house.
And my father
You have supposed him deadsuppose so
still; but O fly, the moment you are able, and
comfort your poor sister, who mourns at once the
loss of father and brother. She believes you to
be dead.
Bountiful Heaven! accept a sailor's thanks,
that he has been shipwrecked in the very harbor
of happiness! I shall again see the most amiable
and affectionate sister that a brother could ever
boast. I will set out for Ohio as soon as I am
able to travel.
O'Hara now pressed his questions with so much
eagerness, that he soon drew from George all the
circumstances attending his father's death.
That is the last and most afflicting blow of
all, he exclaimed. Brothermotherfather
all stabbed by England! But I will not vent my
feelings in unavailing complaints and windy
words; my arm can reach her; and English
blood shall yet bathe the hand that has been
hardened
in her service. Vengeance will be
sanctified
by such a cause, and vengeance shall be mine!
I will visit my sister, and thenO, my poor
father
,
blind and broken-hearted! the tears you
have shed shall be paid, drop for drop, in the
vital
blood of your savage murderers!
Be calm, my friend, interrupted George, in
a soothing tone; revenge will not remedy the
evil, and is a passion that should ever be
discarded
from the human breast.
Would
you
be calm, sir, under the load of
wrongs I have suffered? Were the savages of
your frontier to break into your father's house
and lay the whole family bleeding at your feet
then drag you into captivity, and compel you to
wear out the years and strength of youth in
odious
servitude, laboring for the very monsters that
had robbed you of liberty, home, family, and all
would you be calm under such circumstances?
or would you not rather wreak vengeance on the
murderers, were such vengeance in your power?
I should probably experience a combat in
my bosom between feeling and duty, answered
our hero; but duty would forbid revenge.
Never
should the sword be drawn from such a
motive
;
and I should not dare to face death in the
field of battle with such a demoniac passion in
my bosom, as to wish the death of a
fellow-creature
.
I wish to carry with me into the other
world as few evil desires as possible, if it were
only to disappoint those infernal spirits who
would be pleased to see me arrive, freighted with
a sufficient load to sink me down among them.
No, my friend, we ought to love our enemies, even
while duty compels us to be their executioners.
However I may revere the mild precepts of
religion, replied O'Hara, I never shall be
able to reduce this one to practice. I cannot love
the English, and it would be dastardly hypocrisy
in me to say that I do. Indeed I cannot conceive
how your theory and practice is to be reconciled
you preach forbearance, and yet shoot your
enemies!
A humane surgeon, replied George, will
perform a dreadful operation with firmness,
although
his heart may bleed for the pain which
duty compels him to inflict. Is it not genuine
mercy to destroy a few to save the many from
destruction
?
Is it not mercy to the public to
punish
the murderer? and cannot this be done
without
revenge in the breast of him whose duty it is
to inflict this punishment? It is an old maxim, (and
not the worse for being so) that `it is wise to
make choice of the
least
of two evils.' The
degradation
of our country, the infringement of her
rights, and the enslaving or murdering of her
citizens
,
is a great evil; but we must either choose
to submit to this great evil, or else choose the
lesser one of drawing the sword, and, by slaying
a few, deter the rest from repeating the
aggressions
.
Even though
one third
of our own
countrymen
perish in the contest, still if the
two thirds
are thereby rescued from the vassalage and
misery
that would otherwise have been entailed on
the whole, the sacrifice is proper. Does a parent
feel revenge in correcting a vicious son? or does
he not rather summon all his firmness to support
him in a painful duty, the performance of which
may save its object from ruin, and his family from
disgrace? Revenge forms no part of a soldier's
dutyhe can chastise the enemies of his country
without it.
I do not comprehend the distinction,
replied
O'Hara; and we will not disagree about
words. Were I convinced that my present
feelings
towards England were wrong, I would strive
to subdue them. Yet
But you might slaughter thousands of
innocent
men, interrupted George, without ever
drawing blood from a being that has injured you,
and thus revenge would never attain its object.
Remember that the soldiery and sailors of Great
Britain are not accountable for the atrocities of
her ministers; and the very men on which you
might wreak your vengeance, would, perhaps,
have been the first to commiserate your sufferings
and denounce the authors.
Will not the same remark apply with equal
force to yourself? asked the sailor. In the
course of your professional duties, may you not
also slaughter innocent men?
Most undoubtedly, answered George; but
here lies the differenceto me that would be a
most painful dutywhereas, to one whose soul
is breathing revenge, it would yield the greatest
delight, and make him appear so much like a
devil
,
that the infernals might mistake him for one
of their own fraternity, should he chance to leave
the world in that horrid state. I have no
objection
to your fighting the enemy if patriotism
carries
you to the field; but it is for your own sake,
(not the enemy's) that I wish you to discard all
feelings of revenge.
Wellwell cried O'Hara; I will fight
them, that I am resolved upon, and I promise you
to do it from the best motives I can. In the
mean time I am grateful for your advice, and will
endeavor to believe it correct.
George gave him his hand with a smile, and
soon after took his leave, promising to call again
the next morning.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
AMERICAN HEROISM.
Hail, gallant heroes! bright your glory lives;
Nor shall malignant envy dare assail;
Receive the laurel which your country gives,
And share her triumphs while she tells the tale.
Anon
.
In
a few days O'Hara declared himself
sufficiently
recovered to commence his intended
journey
,
and many were the pens which this
declaration
put in motion. Few messengers of government
were ever charged with more numerous or (in
the estimation of those concerned) more
important
dispatches. George wrote to his father and
to CatharineAmelia did the same. Cushing and
Morse both wrote to the major, and Ellen added
a
postscript
to each of their letters. With all
my exertions, however, I have not been fortunate
enough to procure copies of these important
documents
;
the following brief extract from that
written
by Morse, being all I have been able to obtain.
After granting a general assent to the major's
opinion on the subject of
defensive war
, the
writer
proceeds to give the outlines of a few
important
occurrences which could not have yet reached
his correspondent's ear; and this he does in the
following words, and under the following head
WAR EVENTS.
Another dazzling blaze of glory, my dear
sir, encircles the stripes and stars of
Freedom
.
On the thirteenth of October, the sloop of
war Wasp, commanded by captain Jones, sailed
from the Delaware, and on the eighteenth of the
same month, after a long and heavy gale, she fell
in with a number of strongly armed
merchantmen
,
under convoy of his Britannic majesty's
sloop of war Frolic, which was captured by the
Wasp, after a very desperate and sanguinary
conflict of forty-three minutes.
The first lieutenant on board the Wasp, whose
name is Biddle, is a young gentleman to whom
captain Jones has been long attached by the
strong tie of friendship, arising from sympathy of
taste, profession, and valor. They served
together
in the Mediterranean, and for twenty
tedious
months were fellow-captives in the
dungeons
of Tripoli. They are now rewarded with
never-fading wreaths of fame.
In four or five minutes after the commencement
of the action, the maintopmast of the Wasp was
shot away, and in falling, with the yard
attached
to it, across the foretopsail braces,
rendered
her head sails totally unmanageable during
the rest of the action. In two or three
minutes
more her gaft and mizen-top-gallant-sail
fell before the fire of the enemy, but still she
continued the contest with unabated ardor. The
sea was so rough that the muzzles of their guns
were frequently in the water. At length the
Wasp shot ahead of her opponent, raked her and
then resumed her position on her larboard bow.
In a few minutes they closed with a most severe
concussion, when the jib-boom of the enemy
crossed
the deck of the Wasp, directly above the
heads of Jones and Biddle, who were at that
moment
standing together near the capstan. The
Frolic now lay so fair for raking, that they
decided
to give her a closing broadside, and then
29
board. In loading for this broadside, the two
vessels
were so near each other, that the rammers
of the American guns were pushed against the
Frolic's bows. Two of the Wasp's guns
entered
the enemy's bow ports, and swept the whole
length of her deck.
American valor is confined to no rank. A
common sailor of the Wasp, called Jack Lang,
(a native of New-Brunswick, in the state of
New-Jersey
,
who had been once impressed by a
British
man of war) at this moment mounted a gun,
and, with a cutlass in his hand, sprang upon the
Frolic's bowsprit. Jones called to him to desist,
as he wished to give the enemy another
broadside
;
but the gallant tar's impetuosity could not
be restrained, and the whole crew were panting
to follow him. Unwilling to check such laudable
ardor and enthusiasm as his men evinced, Jones
consented to their wishes. Biddle mounted on
the hammock-cloth, and the crew followed; but
his feet got entangled in the rigging of the
enemy's
bowsprit, and midshipman Baker, in his
ardor
to get on board, laying hold of his coat,
Biddle
fell backwards on the deck of the Wasp.
He sprang up, and as the next swell of the sea
brought the Frolic nearer, he got on her bowsprit,
passed Lang and another American seaman on
her forecastle, and was astonished to find not a
single man alive on the Frolic's deck, except the
seaman at the wheel, and three officers. The
deck was slippery with blood, and strewed with
the bodies and limbs of the dead. As he
approached
the officers, on the quarter deck, they
threw down their swords, making at the same
time an inclination of the body indicating their
surrender. At this moment the colors were still
flying, and were now hauled down by Biddle, in
exactly forty-three minutes from firing the first
broadside.
The Frolic's deck, and indeed every part of
her, presented a most shocking spectacle; the
birth-deck, particularly, was crowded with dead,
and wounded, and dying; there being but a small
proportion of her crew who had escaped. Jones
instantly sent on board his surgeon's mate, and
Biddle directed all the purser's blankets and
slops to be brought up for the use of the
wounded
;
every exertion that humanity could dictate,
was made to alleviate their sufferings.
It now appeared that the Frolic was superior
in force to the Wasp, by exactly
four
twelve
pounders; her sails, masts and rigging, suffered
less than those of the Wasp; consequently the
enemy possessed superior advantages in
manuvring
,
and his loss compared to ours, was on his
own estimate more than six to one killed, and
nearly twelve to one wounded. The exact
number
of the enemy's killed and wounded could not
be ascertained; but it is not less than thirty
killed
and fifty wounded. The commander, captain
Whinyates, and his second lieutenant, were
wounded, and two other officers were killed. The
Wasp had five men killed, and five slightly
wounded
.
Soon after taking possession of the prize,
both her masts fell by the board, covering
the mangled bodies on deck, rendering the most
horrid confusion still worse confounded, and
she lay a complete wreck, exposed to the tossings
of the turbulent billows.
All hands were now employed in clearing
the deck, burying the dead, and taking care of
the wounded, when Jones sent orders to Biddle
to steer for Charleston, or any southern port of
the United States; and as there was a suspicious
sail to windward, the Wasp would continue her
cruise. The ships then parted, and the
supsicious
sail approached very fast. It proved to be
the Poictiers, of seventy-four guns, commanded
by captain Beresford; and as the situation of
both vessels precluded every hope of escape or
resistance, both were surrendered and sent into
Bermuda.

[1]
See Analetic Magazine and Port Folio.
Our cousin Aylwin is again on the ocean, in
the Constitution, but not under Hull, that hero
having been appointed to succeed Chauncey in
the command of the port and harbor of
New-York
.
Bainbridge now commands the
Constitution
,
and he sailed on the twenty-sixth day of last
month. That frigate has already made a lasting
impression on the minds of Englishmen, and this
cruise may perhaps produce a second edition.
Hull `bears his blushing honors thick upon
him;' wherever he goes, rich testimonials of
public
approbation are heaped upon him in the most
splendid profusion. In this town he was
honored
with a public dinner, at which nearly six
hundred
of the most respectable gentlemen of both
political parties united to pay a tribute of
gratitude
and respect to American valor and skill. In
New-York
, a fund has been raised for the
purpose
of purchasing superb swords, to be
presented
to captain Hull and the officers under his
command
.
The corporation of New-York have also
presented him with the freedom of that city, in a
gold box, with an appropiate inscription; and as
an additional tribute of respect, have requested
the captain to favor them with a sitting for his
portrait, to be deposited in the Picture-Gallery of
the City-Hall. In
Philadelphia
, at a general
meeting of the citizens, it was resolved, that a
piece of plate of the most elegant workmanship,
with appropriate emblems, devices and
inscriptions
,
be presented to captain Hull, and that a
like piece of plate be presented to lieutenant
Morris
,
in the name of the citizens of Philadelphia,
as a testimony of esteem and respect for their
gallant conduct; and also, that such other tokens
of esteem be presented to the other officers and
crew of the Constitution, as a committee
appointed
for that purpose might deem proper.
Hull, however, is only one bright star in a
constellation of heroes about to rise in the west,
to the astonishment of all the eastern world.
Indeed
,
sir, I feel confident that the present contest
will produce as many conspicuous naval heroes
as we have vessels afloat, and elecit flashes of
heroism from men of all ranks, unequalled for
brilliancy in the history of the world. Aylwin
assured
me, that in the heat of the action with the
Guerriere, one of the crew of the Constitution,
perceiving
that the flag at the foretopmast head had
been shot away, went up and lashed it in such a
manner as to make it impossible for a shot to take
it away without taking the mast with it. I
understand
that the Secretary of the Navy intends
taking suitable notice of this heroic act.
Among the heroes engaged in this brilliant
event, with whom I have the honor of being
acquainted
,
is lieutenant Morris, who received a
shot through his body, and for some time was not
expected to recover. He has since received the
promotion which his courage and good conduct
29*
so eminently deserve, and has been appointed to
command the frigate Adams, now fitting at
Washington
.
Like most of our naval officers, he made
his
debut
on the Mediterranean station, where he
served several years. By his correct conduct,
his gentlemanlike demeanor, and his unremitted
attention to his duty, he obtained the confidence
of all the commanders with whom he sailed, and
the universal esteem of his brother officers.
Among the chosen few, selected by lieutenant
(now commodore) Decatur, to accompany him in
his gallant expedition to burn the Philadelphia
frigate, midshipman Morris was one. He
followed
lieutenant Decatur in boarding the ship, and
during the conducting of that masterly
achievement
,
manifested many proofs of the dauntless
bravery and intrepid spirit which he is well
known to possess.
Lieutenant-colonel Miller, of the United
States army, who commanded the gallant fourth
regiment in the west, has been exchanged for
captain Dacres of the Guerriere. The colonel is
to join the sixth infantry, commanded by colonel
Simonds, on the Canada frontier.
Admiral sir J. B. Warren arrived at Halifax
on the twenty-seventh September, on board the
San Domingo, of seventy-four guns, in company
with the Poictiers of seventy-four guns, and an
armed brig. The admiral expressed much
surprise
to learn that the United States was still
continuing the war. It was generally believed
in England, that the repeal of the Orders in
Council
would immediately produce a cessation of
hostilities
.
The admiral is not clothed with powers
to treat with the American government.
Captain Porter has sailed on another cruise,
which will probably be long and hazardous, as
his cruising ground is said to extend along the
whole coast of South America, perhaps into the
Pacific ocean. He commands a brave crew of
American tars, and is himself a most daring and
enterprising officer, as you will perceive from the
following facts. He commenced his naval
career
on board the Constellation, captain
Truxton
,
during the short contest we had with France.
In the action with the French frigate the
Insurgent
,
Porter was stationed in the foretop, and
distinguished himself by his good conduct. Want
of friends prevented his promotion at that time;
and to his merit alone he was finally indebted for
a commission. He afterwards signalized himself
in several gallant little affairs on the West-India
station, and also in the Mediterranean, where he
was first lieutenant of the Enterprise, captain
Stewart. In this cruise they encountered a
Tripolitan
corsair of very superior force; a severe
battle ensued, in which the enemy suffered great
slaughter, and was compelled to surrender, while
the Americans received but little injury. In this
brilliant action Porter acquired much reputation
from the conspicuous part he acted. In another
engagement with the enemy, in the harbor of old
Tripoli, where he was sent to destroy some
vessels
laden with wheat, he acquired fresh laurels,
and received a musket ball through his left thigh.
Shortly after recovering from his wound, he
was transposed to the Philadelphia, commanded
by Bainbridge, and was made a captive with the
whole crew in the harbor of Tripoli, the frigate
having grounded and could not be got off.
When peace was at length made, the
captives
were restored from their long and dismal
confinement, and Porter was soon after appointed
to command the Enterprise. While at anchor
in the port of Malta, an English sailor came along
side, and insulted the officers and crew by very
abusive language; Porter overhearing him,
ordered
a boatswain's mate to seize him, and give
him a flogging at the gangway; which order was
promptly obeyed. The governor of Malta,
affected
to consider this a daring outrage, and gave
orders that the forts should not permit the
Enterprise
to depart. No sooner was Porter informed
of it, than he got his vessel ready for action,
weighed anchor, and with lighted matches, and
every man at his station, with the avowed
determination
of firing upon the town if attacked, sailed
between the silent batteries, and departed
unmolested
.
Shortly after this occurrence, in passing
through the Straits of Gibraltar, he was attacked
by twelve Spanish gun-boats, who either
mistook
,
or pretended to mistake his vessel for a
British brig. The calmness of the weather, the
weight of their metal, and the acknowledged
accuracy
of their aim, made the odds greatly against
him. As soon, however, as he was able to near
them, they were assailed with such rapid and
well-directed vollies, as quickly compelled them
to sheer off. This affair took place in sight of
Gibraltar, and in presence of several ships of
the British navy; it was, therefore, a matter of
notoriety, and spoken of in terms of the highest
applause.
Such is the man who has now gone to shake the
southern hemisphere with Freedom's awful thun
der. Can he do otherwise than maintain the honor
of our flag, and reap laurels for himself? He has
already acquired the honor of taking the first
prize in the present war, and sent the first
British
flag to the seat of government.
The British packet Swallow, of eighteen guns,
(bound from Jamaica to Falmouth, with the mail
and specie to the amount of two hundred and
sixty thousand dollars) has arrived at Baltimore,
a prize to commodore Rodgers. The specie was
taken on board the President.
Of transactions on the Niagara, I presume
you possess later accounts than I have seen. The
invasion of Canada, from that quarter, I believe,
remains
in status quo
, since the battle of
Queenston
.
Van Rensselaer has resigned his command
to Smyth, who has issued a very pompous
address
to the men of New-York, inviting them to
join his standard, and promising to lead them to
conquest and glory. There has been some
skirmishing
on the northern frontier, and several
successful
little incursions into the enemy's territory,
particularly by the enterprising Forsyth, whose
affair at Gananoque, in Leeds, you are
undoubtedly
acquainted with, and also the more recent
success of the gallant major Young at St. Regis.
[2]
[2]
Captain Forsyth, with seventy riflemen, entered the village of
Gananoque, a little before sunrise, on the twenty-first of
September
,
and, after a warm contest with one hundred and forty-five
regulars
,
they compelled the enemy to fly, took a number of prisoners,
sixty
stand of arms, two barrels of fixed ammunition, one barrel of
powder
,
one barrel of flints, and several other articles; with which they
returned, (after setting fire to his majesty's store-house) with the loss
of only one man, while the enemy had above a dozen killed, and many
wounded. Major Young crossed the lines on the twenty-first of
October
,
and entered the village of St. Regis early the next morning,
where, after a short contest, in which five of the enemy were killed,
Young succeeded in taking forty prisoners, with their arms,
equipments
,
etc. one stand of colors, and two batteaux, without an
American
being hurt.
General Brown has given a practical
comment
on the subject of
self-defence
.
Ogdensburgh
,
I understand, has been bombarded three
times, and most gallantly defended by that
friend
of liberty.
In your next, I shall expect some information
from the southwest, and your opinion of the
present
situation of that frontier, which from all the
intelligence that has reached us, appears to be a
very critical one. Both Spaniards and Indians
have assumed a menacing attitude; and many
dreadful outrages have been committed. The
Creeks were to hold a grand Council on the
twenty-second of October, to which they invited
the Choctaws, the Chickasaws and the
Cherokees
.
It is possible that the elation produced by
Indian successes in the north, may vanquish the
wavering, and arm the cowardly with a
momentary
courage. If so, the times will be dreadful
to the settlements on the waters of the Mobile,
which lie insulated in the midst of an extensive
wilderness, between Georgia and the Mississippi,
and between Florida and the state of Tennessee.
News from the northern confederacy of the
surrender
of Hull, reached the Creek nation by Indian
expresses, almost as soon as it was carried by the
American mail, and no doubt had considerable
influence on the minds of the Indians at the
general council.
By an act of Congress of the United States,
passed on the twenty-ninth of May last, the town
of Mobile is declared to be a part of the
Mississippi
territory, to be governed by the laws thereof,
and by the laws and ordinances of the United
States relating thereto. But the people of
Mobile
,
though generally anxious to become
American
citizens, do not yet feel a conviction that it
is the intention of our government to make them
such; and there is some reason to apprehend
that, unless this part of the Mississippi territory
be speedily in the occupancy of an American
force, it will not be taken without a bloody
struggle. Adieu.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
THE INTERVIEW.
She fed within her veins a flame unseen:
The hero's valor, acts, and worth, inspire
Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire.
His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart,
Improve the passion, and increase the smart.
Dryden's Virg.
On
the day after our hero's arrival at Boston,
he reported himself to the war department by
letter, and wrote to several of his friends in
Washington. In answer to one of these private
cpistles, he received a most pressing invitation
to make a visit to the seat of government, with
which he determined to comply; and accordingly
commenced his journey for that city on Friday
the twentieth day of November. The Sunday
following he passed with his old acquaintances in
Newport. Perry was not there, having been
several months before promoted to the rank of
master and commander, and ordered to the
command
of the flotilla of gun-boats stationed at the
harbor of New-York, in which duty he was then
engaged.
It perhaps seldom happens that an officer is
first recommended to the notice and favorable
regards of his government by his misfortunes.
Such, however, had been the case with Perry;
a very serious disaster which had befallen him
(subsequent to his short acquaintance with our
hero) had drawn from the secretary of the navy
a complimentary letter, not only acquitting him
of all blame, but highly applauding the
judgment
,
intrepidity, and perseverance he had
displayed
on the unfortunate and trying occasion,
the particulars of which are theseHe had
received
orders to survey the harbor of Newport,
repair to New-London, and from thence
survey
all the intermediate coast. In the
execution
of this duty, he sailed from Newport late in
the evening, with an easterly wind accompanied
by a fog. In the morning he found himself
enveloped
in a thick mist, with a considerable swell
going. In this situation, without any possibility of
ascertaining where he was, the pilot not being
sufficiently acquaintanted with the soundings, the
vessel was carried on a reef, and went to pieces.
On this occasion Perry gave proofs of a most
admirable
coolness and presence of mind. He used
every precaution to save the guns and property,
and was in a great measure successful. He got off
all the crew in perfect safety, and was himself the
last to leave the wreck. His conduct in respect
to this disaster underwent examination by a court
of inquiry, at his own request, by which he was
acquitted with the most honorable testimonials of
their approbation. From that hour he had
become
a favorite in the navy department, and had
probably thus laid the foundation of future
celebrity
in his misfortunes.
A letter on this subject from the navy
department
to commodore Rodgers, contained the
following
sentences:
Having attentively examined the
proceedings
of the court, I derive much satisfaction from
perceiving that it is unnecessary to institute any
further proceedings in the case. With respect
to lieutenant Perry, I can only say, that my
confidence
in him has not been in any degree
diminished
by his conduct on this occasion. The loss
of the Revenge appears to be justly chargeable
to the pilot.
This accident will no doubt present
to lieutenant Perry considerations that may be
useful
to him in future command. An officer, just to
himself, will not be depressed by defeat or
misfortune
;
but will be stimulated by either cause to
greater exertion
.
If there should be any situation in the
squadron
,
to which you can appoint lieutenant Perry,
that may be consistent with his just pretensions,
and not interfere with the rights of others, you
will appoint him to it; if not, he is to be
furloughed
,
waiting the further orders from this
department
.
On Monday, George departed for New-York,
where he arrived on the morning of the
twenty-fifth
,
amidst the ringing of bells and firing of
cannon, in celebration of the day on which the
British troops evacuated the city, after the
revolutionary
war. On the summit of every public
edifice, and on the masts of every vessel in the
harbor, Freedom's bright streaming banners were
gaily displayed, flashing in the sun-beam as they
fluttered in the blast. Martial music was heard
in all directions; the clattering hoofs of the
prancing
cavalry responded to the notes of the soul
30
inspiring bugle; and numerous corps of
volunteers
,
regulars, and militia, were paraded in the
public squares. Our hero instantly forgot the
fatigues
of a long and rapid journey, (during which
he had been assailed by a most furious storm,
that had scattered trees, chimneys and fences in
his road
[3]
[3]
The destructive storm which occurred on Tuesday morning,
November
24, 1812, is probably well remembered. Many vessels were
shipwrecked in the Sound, and a church-steeple in Orange county
was blown down.
) and catching the general glow of
patriotic
enthusiasm that pervaded the city, entered
at once into the festive enjoyments of the
occasion
.
About mid-day the troops had formed a line,
and were reviewed by his excellency the
governor
,
and generals Armstrong and Morton. The
third regiment of the state artillery were then
inducted
into the fortress which they were destined
to garrison,
Fort Gansevoort.
where a national salute was fired.
A sumptuous dinner had been prepared for the
officers of this beautiful regiment, at Mechanic
Hall, and among the invited guests were the
governor
,
generals Armstrong and Morton,
adjutant-general
Paulding, and several United States
officers
of inferior grade, of whom ensign
Willoughby
was one.
After the cloth was removed, patriotic toasts
were mutually pledged in flowing bumpers,
interspersed
with odes, songs, and national airs by an
excellent band of musicians. Among the
sentiments
given on this occasion, the following was
peculiarly grateful to more than one officer
present
:
Our brave brethren in arms who so nobly
sustained the unequal contest at Queenston
. It
was received by the company with rapturous
acclamations
,
which were answered from the
orchestra
in the lofty strains of a full martial
chorus
.
On the approach of evening the company
began
to retire, and our hero accompanied several
officers to the theatre, which was brilliantly
illuminated
in honor of the anniversary. He
entered
amid a gay group of plumes and epaulets, and
took a seat in the second row of boxes, directly
opposite the stage. The house, which was
rapidly
filling when they entered, soon became
crowded, and (as usual on the evening of a
holiday
)
extremely noisy.
The curtain drew up, and a short but very
pleasing prelude was performed, entitled
All
in Good Humor
, and he must have been indeed
a most surly cynic who could witness its
representation
without being charmed into the feeling
which the title expresses. The whole house
appeared
in the best of humors.
When the curtain fell at the conclusion of the
prelude, master Whale, better known as the
infant
vestris, performed a
naval hornpipe
, in a
style that drew reiterated peals of approbation
from the admiring audience.
The play which succeeded was the celebrated
Point of Honor
, or
School for Soldiers
, and
many were the sympathetic tears which silently
applauded the performance. When the amiable
and unfortunate Durimel appeared on the stage
as a convicted deserter led to the place of
execution
;
when blind-folded he kneeled to meet his
fate; and when the word to
fire
was given by his
own father, who in the same instant threw
himself
before his son, to receive the fire and die with
him, convulsive sobs could be distinctly heard in
every direction. The command to
fire
was
instantaneously
succeeded by the word
hold!
thundered in the voice of an officer who rushed in
with a reprieve, and with his sword struck up the
levelled muskets before a trigger could be
pressed
.
The effect on the audience was electrical,
and just such as the reality of such a scene might
be supposed to produce. The soft contagion
ran through every bosom, and appeared in every
eye, whether in gallery, pit, or boxes.
A short interlude then followed, entitled
Huzza
for the Constitution
, written by a citizen of
New-York in honor of Hull's victory over the
Guerriere. The scene represented the lower end
of Broadway, Bowling-Green and Battery, and in
the distance appeared the forts, and entrance to
the harbor. A countryman entered, who, in a
short soliloquy on the political relations of his
country, was suddenly interrupted by the entrance
of a sailor in whom he recognised his own son.
After many embraces and noisy congratulations
on the happiness of the meeting, Jack, (who it
seemed belonged on board the Constitution)
proceeded
to give his father an account of the
engagement
,
in a style truly technical and animated.
The old man appeared highly delighted with his
son's unpolished relation, and so perhaps did every
person in the house. The afterpiece of Timour
the Tartar concluded the evening's
entertainments
,
and that character was supported in a most
excellent style by Mr. Simpson.
Although our hero never entered the theatre
for any other purpose than that of seeing and
enjoying
the performance, he was still not
insensible
to the attractions of a splendid auditory; and,
between the acts, was always agreeably
employed
in surveying the human face divine, or in
conversing with any accessible being around him,
male or female. On the present occasion his
curiosity
had been considerably excited by the
appearance
of a lady in the adjoining box, whose
eyes were continually directed to himself. Two
or three times, in the course of the evening, he
changed his position, in order to ascertain
whether
his person was or was not the subject of such
uninterrupted scrutiny. Being at length
convinced
that this was the case, he took the earliest
opportunity
of crowding to that side of the box which
adjoined hers, where he was in fact literally
seated
by the side of the fair stranger. He now
attempted
to draw her into conversation:
determined
,
if possible, to discover the motive which
could induce her to honor him with such
particular
notice. As soon, however, as she perceived
him approach, she suddenly withdrew her eyes,
and pulling a veil over her face, remained
totally
silent to all our hero's observations, nor even
regarded him with a look.
When the curtain fell on the last scene of the
play, an elderly gentleman, who sat by her side,
arose, and whispering something in her ear to
which she bowed assent, left the box. She
followed
him with her eyes until he entered the
lobby
,
then turning to our hero, she uttered in a low
voiceFor Heaven's sake, Mr. Willoughby,
speak no more to me
here;
I will explain the
reason if you will call to-morrow morning at No.
William-street. Fail not for the world, for I
have a thousand things of the utmost importance
to communicate. At eleven o'clock precisely I
shall expect you.
30*
Although this address convinced George that
he had not been squandering so many words on a
stranger, he was still ignorant of her name and
quality. He could not recollect when, or where,
but was sure he had somewhere before met the
gaze of the sharp black eye which was now
fixed
on his. The rest of her features were
concealed
by her veil.
You must not fail to come, added she with
great earnestness, but in the same low tone.
Who shall Ienquire for? he would have
said, but she interrupted him, and in a hurried,
embarrassed manner, whisperedHush! say
not another wordI beg of youI command
you! Only remember to-morrow, at eleven.
Our hero was silent, and in a moment the
elderly
gentleman returned to her side, and
presented
her with some fruit, which she accepted.
The curiosity of George was on tip-toe, but
having
been forbidden to speak, there was no way of
gratifying it. But why his conversation with an
acquaintance should depend on the exit or
entrance
of a third person, he could not conceive
strangers they could not be, because she had
addressed
him by his name, and requested an
interview
.
As they were passing through the crowded
lobby to leave the house, George purposely kept
close to her right side; the elderly gentleman,
under
whose protection she evidently moved,
retaining
his position on the left. But her face
being
still enveloped in her veil, our hero gained
nothing by the intrusion but an ardent pressure of
the hand, which was probably intended to remind
him of his engagement the next day, and to which
he answered in the same silent language(plain
as a hand could speak)I shall not forget it.
The lady, with her conductor, entered a coach
at the door, and our hero repaired to his
lodgings
at the City-Hotel, where he forgot himself,
the world, and his engagement, until eight o'clock
the next morning.
The last stroke of eleven had not resounded
from St. Paul's, as George knocked at the door to
which he had been invited. He was received
by a female servant, who ushered him into the
parlor, and left him with observing that her
mistress
would be ready to receive him in a few
minutes. While he was amusing himself in
surveying
some beautiful paintings with which the
walls of the room were decorated, the messenger
returned, and requested him to walk up stairs.
He immediately complied, and followed his fair
conductor to a corresponding room in the second
story, where, on a sofa near the fire, sat the
object
of his visit, apparently absorbed in grief. As
her visitor approached, she arose, and removing a
handkerchief from her eyes, displayed a lovely
countenance, glowing with blushes and bathed in
tears, through which a most fascinating smile
shone like the sun in an April shower. She gave
him her hand, and our hero exclaimed with
unaffected
surpriseIs it possible!Sophia
Palmer
?
And did you not know me last evening?
asked she with a sigh; You knew that I was in
this city?
Indeed, I did not. The shortness of my
stay in Boston prevented my learning the
situation
of half my friends. You are here on a visit.
I presume.
Did you not hear a single word of me?
inquired
she, with great earnestness. Was
my name never mentioned in your hearing?
It was not, Sophia, if I can trust my
recollection
.
And you made no inquiriesforgetting, I
suppose, that there was such a being in existence.
But come,added she in a more cheerful tone
I forgive you; take a seat here by my side;
we have but one hour to converse, and I have a
hundred thousand things to sayand yetI
know not how to begin.
For a few moments both were silent; at length,
without raising her eyes, she asked if he had
forgotten
the masquerade.
I shall never forget it, he exclaimed,
thinking
of the
Mysterious Chief
.
You have forgotten the little
Gipsey?
but
she has never forgottenthe
Minstrel
.
George
had
forgotten the little Gipsey; but
the character now recurred to his mind with all
the attending circumstances.
And was it, then, the lovely Sophia who so
kindly told my fortune?
And whom you so
unkindly
refused to meet in
the pavilion. O George! George!do not
despise
meI amindeed, I am very,
very
unhappy
wretchedmiserable! Here she was again
silent, with her face concealed in her
handkerchief
,
and reclined on the arm of the sofa.
I am surprised and shocked to hear it,
replied
George. But if you think me worthy of
your confidence, unfold to me the cause of your
grief; and, if it lies within the compass of my
poor ability to alleviate your sufferings, I swear
to do it.
She raised her head, and gazing at him through
her tears, replied
O, you will break your oath.
George felt hurt at an insinuation that implied
a doubt of his friendship, or his sincerity; he
therefore ardently exclaimed
Never! So help me God!
It
is
in your power to afford me reliefto
wipe all these tears from my cheeks, and make
this poor heart dance in my bosom for joy. It
is
in
your
power, but you will never do it; you
alone can save me, and yet I shall be lost!
As she uttered this she unconsciously leaned
towards
the embarrassed George; her right hand
was on his arm, and her left pressed to her own
heart. Her look was tender and supplicating, and
her whole frame extremely agitated. Our hero
became apprehensive that she would fall from the
seat, and therefore supported her with his arm;
when she gently, and almost imperceptibly, slid
to his bosom, and there hid her face, moistening
his ruffles with her tears, while her arm was
thrown over his shoulder. He could distinctly feel
the violent throbs of her heart against his breast,
and the lengthened throes of her bosom laboring
with half-suppressed sobs. His situation was
becoming
more embarrassing, but he knew not how
to change it. At length she spake
Are you aware of the full extent of your
oath?
Tell me the nature of your afflictions. What
has made you unhappy?
Love.
Love! How can love be productive of
misery
?
How can love make Sophia unhappy?
If you can ask such a question, said she,
starting suddenly from his bosom, I have no
hope from your oath. Appeal to your own heart
but, did you ever love?
George was silent; but his blushes answered
in the affirmative. Sophia continued
If ever you are doomed to love without hope,
as I have doneas I now doyou will then, and
not till then, know how to feel forhow to pity
me. Whole nights of sleepless agony have I
passed since last we met, steeping my pillow in
tears, or breathing my sighs to the midnight moon
almost cursing the day that I was born. Many
a summer hour have I spent in the deepest
recesses
of a wood, there to weep unseen, and tell
my sorrows to the listening trees; catching the
mere shadow of consolation in hearing the
distant
echoes repeat a name which only in such
profound
solitude I would venture to pronounce
the name of the dear youth whose image will for
ever dwell in this afflicted breast. But why
should I attempt to describe all I have suffered?
why compel you to share sorrows which
nothing
can remove? You cannotyou will not
impart
comfort to my heart; but it will soon break
with its own griefs, and then poor Sophia will find
peace in the grave!
What would you have me do, Sophia?
asked
the compassionate George, now almost melted
into tearshis tone and aspect expressive of
the tenderest pity. How
can I
afford you
comfort
?
Shall I intercede with the object of your
affections
,
and endeavor to kindle in his bosom a
reciprocal passion?
Do so, and I will for ever bless you. This is
what you
can
do, and this you are bound by an
oath to perform.
Who is he? I am ready and eager to fulfil
the engagement. Where is he?
In my arms, exclaimed she, throwing herself
on his bosom, and encircling him in a most
tender
embrace. Though you may despise me
for the confessionthough you may spurn me
from you with contemptyet still will I cling to
you thus, until I have discharged a load from my
heart which will otherwise burst it. It is
yourself
and
you only that I love with the most
unbounded
affection. It is for you that I have
watched, and prayed, and wept. It is your image
alone that fills my bosom, and lives there night
and day. In your arms alone can I hope to find
happinesshere is paradisethe only heaven I
covet. All without is miserydespairthe
only
hell I deprecate.
Damnable strumpet! exclaimed a voice of
thunder, and in the same instant Sophia was
dragged by the hair from our hero's arms, who
started on his feet, and recognised the elderly
gentleman whom he had seen at the play. With
a blow that covered her lovely face with blood,
he struck the shrieking Sophia to the floor, and
as George was darting to her assistance, seized
him by the collar. Our hero dashed away his
hand, and pushing him ungently aside, flew to
the prostrate fair, whom he tenderly raised in
his arms, and placed on the sofa, bleeding and
insensible; then turning to the enraged assailant,
demanded, in rather a haughty tone, by what
authority he thus presumed to ill-treat a lady who
was mistress of her own actions.
Indeed! exclaimed the German, (for such
his accent declared him to be) But I find she
has deceived you, as well as all the rest of her
friends. I am her husband, sir, and know how
to chastise any scoundrel who dares intrude on a
husband's rights.
The first part of this address almost petrified
George with astonishment; but the concluding
words kindled in his bosom a different sentiment,
which blazed in lightning from his indignant eye,
as he exclaimed
You dare not apply that epithet to me, sir;
nor implicate me in the false aspersion.
I darebut do not, replied the German, in
a lower tone. You forget, sir, how much
appearances
are against you. But I am more just
I have been (though unintentionally on my part)
an invisible auditor of this accursed
tete-a-tete
,
and acquit you of any intentions hostile to my
honor. That traitress alone is guiltyand
severely
shall she atone for it.
Unhappylost Sophia! exclaimed George,
turning towards the beautiful insensible; into
what an abyss of misery has your indiscretion
plunged you! How will your worthy parents
your amiable sister, sustain the affliction which a
knowledge of this event would entail upon them!
Let me entreat you, sir, to forget this aberration
of her youthful heart, and by your generous
forbearance
make it again yours. Your forgiveness
will saveyour severity lose her for ever.
Your compassion is misplaced, sir, and you
plead in vain. Have I not just heard her declare
that her heart was wholly yours, and you ask her
husband to win it by forgiveness! I cannot at
present command my feelingsoblige me by
withdrawing.
Not till you promise
Beware, sir, interrupted the enraged
husband
,
how you tempt me to retract my opinion
of your own honor.
At least, replied George, suffer her to
receive
medical assistance. She is bleeding from
the effects of your resentmentshe may never
recover---You would not be her executioner?
Comply, for your own sake, with my request, and
I take my leave.
Her health shall be attended to, and when
you wish to see me, send your address. Adieu!
With feelings which it would be difficult to
describe
,
our hero proceeded to his lodgings. He
was unhappy without being guilty; a very
common
case in this wicked world, where happiness
does not altogether depend upon the rectitude of
our own conduct. Where, then, is the
consolation
?
It follows---
How much more unhappy
would George have been, had he been guilty!
After
a little reflection, he felt the full force of the
sentiment, and regained his composure.

CHAPTER XL.
FURTHER PARTICULARS.
Force, and the will of our imperious rulers,
May bind two bodies in one wretched chain;
But minds will still look back to their own choice.
So the poor captive, in a foreign realm,
Stands on the shore and sends his wishes back

Rowe's Fair Pen
.
When
George Willoughby left Boston with his
father, in December, one thousand eight hundred
and eleven,
[4]
[4]
See vol. i. p. 164.
he carried with him the unguarded
heart of Sophia Palmer, but was altogether
unconscious
of the prize. Sophia drooped in
despondency
,
without communicating the cause of
her unhappiness. All the effects of her
unfortunate
passion were accurately described by
herself
in the foregoing chapter. Her parents were
alarmed at the change in the disposition of their
youngest daughter, but had no suspicion of the
real cause. They attributed it to the same
constitutional
languor which appeared to affect her
sister, and applied physical remedies. On the
following summer their anxious father took them
both to Ballston, in the state of New-York, to
try the efficacy of the waters; but, after
continuing
there a month, perceived no change for the
better
in the health of his darling girls. It was here
that he received a private account of the battle of
Maguago, in which ensign Willoughby was
reported
to have been slain. The alarming effects
which this intelligence produced on the mind of
Sophia betrayed the secret wound which was
rankling
in her bosom.
Previous to this, a rich German, with whom
they became acquainted at the springs, had
declared
himself her admirer. His name was
Kreutzer; he was a merchant of some
eminence
in the city of New-York, and though old
enough to be the father of Sophia, found a
powerful
advocate for his suit in her avaricious parent.
Sophia, however, continued peremptory in
rejecting
the addresses of such a lover, while she
could cherish a hope connected with the object of
her ardent attachment. But all hope was
annihilated
by the account of his death; and,
incessantly
harassed by the importunities of the lover, the
expostulations of her father, and the intreaties of
all her friends, spiritless and almost
broken-hearted
,
she at length yielded a reluctant consent to
become the wife of Kreutzer, who led her, a
passive
victim, to the hymenial altar. A few weeks of
a kind of negative enjoyment succeeded this legal
prostitution, when a letter from Boston undeceived
her with respect to the death of George
Willoughby
,
and plunged her at once into a gulf of
wretchedness
and despair. Filled with unavailing
regret
for the precipitancy of the step she had been
induced to take, she grew unguarded in giving
utterance to her feelings, and thus at once
embittered
the felicity of her doating husband, and
rendered
her own life completely miserable.
Acquainted with the world, and well versed in
the study of human nature, Kreutzer soon
perceived
sufficient grounds for believing that he
had gained a hand without a heart. A spirit of
jealousy succeeded, and many were the anxious
hours he passed in watching the movements of
his wife, while she believed him to be engaged
abroad.
His suspicions, however, were rapidly
declining
for want of any food that could yield them
support, when she unfortunately saw the object
of all her thoughts at the theatre. The passion
which had been smothering in her bosom
without
a breath of hope to revive it, now kindled
like lightning to an irresistible blaze, fed by a
whirlwind of unhallowed wishes. The few seeds
of virtue that had been scattered on the surface
of her uncultivated mind, were now swept like
chalf before the tempest of passion, and totally
disappeared. Sophia was resolved to fall.
In forming this fatal resolution, she displayed
some symptoms of embarrassment that did not
escape
the notice of her husband. These, with
some subsequent trifles, light as air, induced
him to resort to an old, and hitherto unsuccessful
plan. He was under a previous engagement to
visit a sick friend at Westchester, on the
following
day, and at ten o'clock took leave of his wife
for that purpose. Instead, however, of leaving
the house, he ascended, unperceived, to his study,
adjoining the apartment to which Sophia was
confined under the plea of indisposition. With
all that followed the reader is acquainted.
Our hero passed the remainder of the day in
solitude and uneasiness. At one moment he
condemned
theatrical establishments as the primary
cause of all human misery; in the next he
upbraided
himself for acquiescing in so mysterious
an assignation. A train of calm reflection,
however
,
soon convinced him that neither the theatre
nor himself were in fault; that the lovely, the
frail Sophia alone was culpable, and she alone
deserved to suffer. But was her fault
commensurate
with its punishment? Was not her crime
involuntary? Could she help loving him?
George pitied, but could not excuse the
unfortunate
fair one whose crime consisted not in
loving
him, but in deceiving her husband and
harboring
thoughts in her bosom inimical to
virtue
and his honor; in passively yielding to an
enemy, instead of resisting and opposing him.
There is no sin in being tempted, for the Saviour
of the world was tempted at
all points
as we
are, and was yet without iniquity; the sin
consists
in yielding to, instead of opposing, the
passion
which tempts us.
Sophia could and ought to have avoided
instead
of seeking an interview so hostile to her
peaceso hazardous to her honor. She had
plighted her nuptial faith in the presence of
Heaven
,
and if this had been done while she knew that
her heart was not in her disposal, the sacrifice of
feeling to duty was the least atonement she could
make for the crime. It was a grievous fault, and
grievously Sophia has answered it.
Such were the reflections which naturally arose
in the mind of George, and warranted him in
acquitting
both himself and the theatre of all blame
respecting the event he lamented. He felt the
liveliest gratitude to Heaven for his own
deliverance
from evilhis rescue from a temptation
that had convinced him of the frailty of his
nature
.
He had been providentially snatched from
the brink of a precipice to which he had been
unwittingly
and innocently drawn, and on the
dizzy
verge of which he had actually tottered.
Grateful for the interposition to which he owed
his safety, and well aware that his interference
31*
would not tend to soften the rigor of Sophia's
fate, he resolved to prosecute his journey, and
leave the event to Providence. His anxiety,
however, to ascertain the state of her health,
would not permit him to leave the city without
first seeking another interview with her husband;
and he accordingly, on the third day, dispatched
a servant of the Hotel with a letter containing
his address, and a request that Kreutzer would
favor him with a few minutes conversation at his
lodgings. But the messenger returned without
delivering the note, stating that the house was
shut up, and the family removed to the country.
After spending the whole day in fruitless
inquiries
respecting the place of their destination,
he relinquished the pursuit, and on the following
morning departed for Washington.
CHAPTER XLI.
A NAVAL BALL.
Thy birth, Columbia, sons so brave,
Thy waters, forests, all proclaim
Thy destin'd course is o'er the wave,
And ocean is thy field of fame.
Anon
.
Among
the naval heroes who were now at the
seat of government, were Hull, Morris, and
Stewart
;
the latter commanding the Constellation,
which had been undergoing repairs at the navy
yard, and was nearly ready for sea. Although
Stewart had not yet signalized himself in the war
with England, he was not destitute of naval
renown
.
During the rupture with France he had
distinguished
himself in several little brilliant affairs
on the West-India station, while commanding the
Enterprise, a schooner of twelve guns.
When the American government found it
necessary
to chastise the insolence of the Tripolitans,
the Mediterranean became a theatre of naval
enterprise
.
Stewart commanded the Syren in
Preble's
squadron, and performed many valuable
and hazardous services for his country. During
the blockade of Tripoli, he captured a Maltese
brig of twelve guns, and a Greek ship, for
attempting
to enter the harbor; and afterwards led
the attack against two of the enemy's forts,
westward
of the town, which were silenced and
completely
demolished, without the loss of a single
American. In the first bombardment of Tripoli,
on the third day of August, one thousand eight
hundred
and four, Stewart rendered himself
conspicuous
by his heroic conduct. It was on the
occasion
of this splendid victory that the pope is said
to have exclaimed
the Americans have done
more for Christendom in one battle, than all
Europe
in a century
.
In a few days after this affair Stewart received
a commission of master and commander, and in
every subsequent operation against the enemy
proved himself worthy of the promotion.
On the commencement of hostilities with
England
,
he had been appointed to the command of
the Constellation, which required so much repair,
that the greatest exertion and industry had now
been exercised for several months, under the
superintendance
of Stewart, to render her
competent
for service.
On the twenty-sixth day of November,
however
,
her repairs were completed, and she was
only waiting for a few additional hands to
proceed
to sea. Arrangements had been previously
made by her polite commander for giving on that
day a splendid entertainment on board the frigate,
to terminate with a grand ball, to which several
hundred ladies and gentlemen were specially
invited
.
The President of the United States, heads
of departments, and most of the members of
congress
,
were present on the occasion; besides Hull,
Morris, and many other naval officers.
In return for this fanciful and brilliant aquatic
fete, the principal citizens of Washington
determined
to treat the gallant Stewart with a
Naval
Ball
on shore, and the evening of the eighth of
December had been pitched upon for that
purpose
,
when our hero arrived in the city and was
immediately honored with a card of invitation.
The preparations and arrangements for this
fete exhibited a taste and splendor befitting the
occasion. The rooms were fancifully decorated
with appropriate ornaments, interspersed with
nautical emblems, national banners, and trophies
of naval victory. The colors of the Guerriere and
Alert were displayed on the walls, beneath the
festoons of striped bunting suspended from the
cornices. Nothing had been omitted on the part
of the managers that could please the eye,
exhilarate
the fancy, or gratify the taste.
But an unexpected zest awaited this
entertainment
,
calculated to elevate the usual serene glow
of festive joy, to a paroxysm of enthusiastic
rapture
.
Towards evening, while many an ardent
fancy was enjoying in anticipation the promised
pleasures of the approaching scene, private
letters
from New-York announced the glorious news
of
another Naval Victory
, which a printed
handbill
(issued from the press of the Intelligencer)
soon circulated through the city, amid the most
lively demonstrations of joy. The sum of this
vivifying intelligence was this
Commodore
Decatur, of the frigate United States, had
captured
and brought into port, the British frigate
Macedonian
,
after an action of seventeen minutes; and
that lieutenant Hamilton, son to the secretary of
the navy, was on his way to the seat of government
with the official account of the engagement
.
Every face that entered the ball-room was
dressed in smilesevery bosom bounded with
delight, and the sprightly dancers seemed to
tread on air. A large and very respectable
company soon assembled, among whom were the
first characters in the nation; the beauty, taste,
fashion, and virtue, of Columbia District, were
here concentred in one festive mansion. All
was joy and gaiety, such as could scarcely admit
of augmentation; and yet it was destined to be
increased.
About nine o'clock, as our hero was engaged
in conversation with the amiable sisters of
lieutenant
Hamilton, whom he was felicitating on the
safety of their gallant brother, and the pleasure
of a speedy meeting, a rumor ran through the
assembly
that the young hero had already arrived,
bearing the colors of the Macedonian and
dispatches
from his commodore to the secretary.
The effect was electrical. He is come!
reiterated the affectionate sisters--He is come!
exclaimed the delighted fatherthe tears of a
doating mother expressed her silent joy. The
gentlemen rushed out of the room and crowded
down the stairs to meet the herald of victory,
who was received with loud acclamations and
repeated huzzas; every shout vibrated through
some tender bosoms in the festive hall. The
crowd are now heard reascending the stairs
eyes glistenbosoms palpitate; they enter the
hall, and young Hamilton flies into the extended
arms of a fond father, mother, sisters! It was a
scene more easily conceived than described.
The hall, as before intimated, was decorated
with the trophies of naval victorythe colors of
the Guerriere and the Alert, displayed on the
walls, roused the proud feelings of patriotism, and
had revived in every mind the recollection of the
bravery which won them. The flag of the
Macedonian
alone was wanting to complete the
group. It was now produced, and borne into the
hall by Hull, Stewart and others, amid the loud
acclamations of the company, and greeted with
national music from the band. The amusements
of the evening were suspended from the arrival
of Hamilton, until the fervor of the moment had
in some degree subsided. Mutual gratulations
went round the room; a general expression of
the tribute due to skill and valor, involuntarily
broke from the lips of all; and the smile of
beauty
,
the meed of valor, was liberally bestowed on
the brave defenders of their country's rights.
Subsequently at the supper table, a toast was
given
by one of the managers---
Commodore
Decatur
and the officers and crew of the frigate United
States
---and received with the greatest
enthusiasm
,
and repeated plaudits.
The following is a copy of the despatches
which young Hamilton delivered to his father:
U. S. F. United States, at Sea
,
October
30, 1812.
The Hon.
Paul Hamilton
,
Sir
I have the honor to inform you, that on
the 25th inst. being in the lat. 29 N. long. 29, 30,
W. we fell in with, and, after an action of an hour
and an half, captured his Britannic Majesty's ship
Macedonian, commanded by captain John
Carden
,
and mounting forty-nine carriage guns (the
odd gun shifting.) She is a frigate of the largest
class, two years old, four months out of dock, and
reputed one of the best sailors in the British
service
.
The enemy being to windward, had the
advantage of engaging us at his own distance,
which was so great, that for the first half hour we
did not use our carronades, and at no moment
was he within the complete effect of our
musketry
and grapeto this circumstance and a heavy
swell, which was on at the time, I ascribe the
unusual length of the action.
The enthusiasm of every officer, seaman and
marine on board this ship, on discovering the
enemy
their
steady conduct in battle, and
precision
of their fire, could not be surpassed. Where
all met my fullest expections, it would be unjust
in me to discriminate. Permit me, however, to
recommend to your particular notice, my first
lieutenant, William H. Allen.
[5]
[5]
See vol. i. p. 75.
He has served with
me upwards of five years, and to his unremitted
exertions in disciplining the crew, is to be
imputed
the obvious superiority of our gunnery
exhibited
in the result of the contest.
Subjoined is a list of the killed and wounded on
both sides. Our loss, compared with that of the
enemy, will appear small. Amongst our
wounded
you will observe the name of lieutenant Funk,
who died in a few hours after the actionhe was
an officer of great gallantry and promise, and the
service has sustained a severe loss in his death.
The Macedonian lost her mizen-mast, fore and
main-top-masts and main yard, and was much cut
up in her hull. The damage sustained by this ship
was not such as to render her return into port
necessary
,
and had I not deemed it important that
we should see our prize in, should have
continued
our cruise.
With the highest consideration and respect, I
am, sir, your obedient humble servant.
(Signed) STEPHEN DECATUR.
In the above affair there were but five
Americans
killed and seven wounded, while the British
suffered a loss of
thirty-six killed
and
sixty-eight
wounded!
In a letter to his father, George gave a detailed
account of all the foregoing circumstances, and
then proceeded in the following manner:
So much for Carden's confidence in his own
experience
, and in the superiority of the
Macedonian
.
Experience is a dear school; but in
no other, it seems, would this gentleman become
convinced of his error. The largest frigate in
the British navy, has been dismasted and
compelled
to surrender, with one third of her crew
killed and wounded, by an American frigate which
Carden (in my hearing in Norfolk) pronounced
inferior to his own ship; adding, that from
experience
he felt satisfied he could take the
United
States with the Macedonian!
[6]
[6]
See vol. i. p. 193.
What a
gratification will this news be to Aylwin!
But even Americans are astonished at the
unparalleled effects of Decatur's fire. His ship
was literally enveloped in flames, which drew
repeated
shouts from the British, who supposed her
to be actually on fire. When the Macedonian
struck, she had nothing standing but her fore and
main masts, and fore-yard. The fore and main
masts were badly wounded, and every spar, even
to the smallest, cut. She received nearly one
hundred shots in her hull, several of which were
between wind and water. All her boats were
rendered useless, excepting a small one, which
was veered out astern before the action
commenced
.
But, so little was the United States
impaired
,
that in five minutes after she had possession
of the Macedonian, she was completely ready for
another action.
When captain Carden came on board the
United States to present his sword to commodore
Decatur, the commodore saidSir, I cannot
receive
the sword of a man who has so bravely
defended
his ship, but I will receive your hand.
You can easily imagine what must have been the
impression produced by this noble reception of a
vanquished enemy.
I have been favored with the perusal of a
letter
from an officer of the United States to his
friend, from which I copy the following:
After securing our prisoners, I was sent on
board the prize to assist in fitting her out, which
we did in a few days, under jury masts. I assure
you, the scene she exhibited just after the action
was distressing to humanity; fragments of the
dead were distributed in every directionthe
decks covered with bloodone continued
agonizing
yell of the unhappy wounded victims; a
32
scene so horrible of my fellow-creatures, I assure
you, deprived me very much of the pleasure of
victory.
I have seen an extract from the muster-roll
found on board the Macedonian, after her
capture
,
from which it appears that there were
seven
impressed Americans
on board of that frigate at the
time of the action, who were compelled to fight
against their own countrymen! Two of them
(John Card and John Wallis
[7]
[7]
See vol. i. p. 204.
) were
killed
in the
contest! and another (William Thompson) had
been
drowned at sea while compelled to assist in
boarding a vessel of his own country!
As these
men were O'Hara's shipmates, you will not fail to
communicate their melancholy fate to himif he
has yet arrived.
Decatur now stands pre-eminent among the
Champions of Naval Freedom, for he has not
only
conquered the enemy, but added a valuable
ship to our rising navy. This victory, however,
was not wanting to stamp him a hero. The fame
he acquired in the Mediterranean during the war
with Tripoli is an inheritance of which nothing
can deprive him; even a
defeat
, instead of the
recent victory, would (like a spot in the sun) have
been lost in the unfaded splendor of his former
achievements. Perhaps you may have forgotten
the event to which I allude, and therefore I will
briefly relate the circumstances attending it.
The Philadelphia frigate, commanded by
Bainbridge, in chasing the Tripolitans, ran
aground in or near the harbor of Tripoli, and
fell into the hands of the enemy. As soon as
Decatur (then a lieutenant) heard of the unfortu
nate event, the idea immediately presented itself
to his mind of attempting her recapture or
destruction
;
and, with some difficulty, he obtained
the permission of commodore Preble to
undertake
the daring enterprise. Having selected for
the expedition a ketch (the Intrepid) which he
had captured from the enemy a few weeks before,
and having manned her with seventy volunteers,
chiefly from his own crew, he sailed from
Syracuse
for the harbor of Tripoli, accompanied by
the Syren, commanded by the gallant Stewart,
(on whose account the late ball was given) who
was to aid with his boats, and to receive the crew
of the ketch, in case it should be found expedient
to use her as a fire-ship.
[8]
[8]
See Analectic Magazine, vol. i. p. 503.
After fifteen days of very tempestuous
weather
,
they arrived at the harbor of Tripoli, a little
before sunset. It had been arranged between
Decatur and Stewart, that the ketch should
enter
the harbor about ten o'clock that night,
attended
by the boats of the Syren. On arriving
off the harbor, the Syren, in consequence of a
change of wind, had been thrown six or eight
miles without the Intrepid. The wind at this time
was fair, but fast declining, and Decatur
apprehended
that, should he wait for the Syren's boats
to come up, it might be too late to make the
attack
that night. Such delay might be fatal to the
enterprise, as they could not remain long on the
coast, their provisions being nearly exhausted.
For these reasons he determined to venture into
the harbor alone, which he did at about eight
o'clock.
An idea may be formed of the extreme
hazard
of this enterprise from the situation of the
frigate. She was moored within half gun-shot of
the bashaw's castle, and of the principal battery.
Two of the enemy's cruisers lay within two
cables'
length, on the starboard quarter, and their
gun-boats within half gun-shot on the starboard
bow. All the guns of the frigate were mounted
and loaded. Such were the immediate perils
which this hero ventured to encounter with a
single
ketch, beside the other dangers that abound
in a strongly fortified harbor.
Although from the entrance to where the
frigate
lay was only three miles, yet, in
consequence
of the lightness of the wind, they did not
get within hail of her until eleven o'clock. When
they had approached within two hundred yards,
they were hailed and ordered to anchor, or they
would be fired into. Decatur ordered a Maltese
pilot, who was on board the ketch, to answer that
they had lost their anchors in a gale of wind on
the coast, and, therefore, could not comply with
their request. By this time it had become
perfectly
calm, and they were about fifty yards from
the frigate. Decatur ordered a small boat that
was alongside of the ketch, to take a rope, and
make it fast to the frigate's fore chains. This
being
done, they began to warp the ketch alongside.
It was not until this moment that the enemy
suspected
the character of their visitor, and great
confusion immediately ensued. This enabled
the adventurers to get alongside of the frigate,
when Decatur immediately sprang aboard,
followed
by midshipman Morris, (who, you know,
was wounded in the action with the Guerriere and
now commands the Adams.) These two were
nearly a minute on deck, before their companions
could succeed in mounting the side.
Fortunately
the Turks were not sufficiently recovered from
their surprise to take advantage of this delay.
They were crowded together on the quarter-deck,
perfectly astonished and aghast, without making
any attempt to oppose the assailing party. As
soon as a sufficient number of Americans had
gained the deck, to form a front equal to that of
the enemy, they rushed in upon them. The
Turks stood the assault but a short time, and were
completely overpowered. About twenty were
killed on the spot, many jumped overboard, and
the rest fled to the main deck, whither they were
pursued and driven to the hold.
After entire possession had been gained of
the ship, and every thing prepared to set fire to
her, a number of launches were seen rowing
round the harbor. This determined Decatur to
remain in the frigate, from whence a better
defence
could be made than from on board the ketch.
The enemy had already commenced firing upon
them from their batteries and castle, and from two
corsairs that were lying near. Perceiving that
the launches did not attempt to approach, he
ordered
that the ship should be set on fire, which
was done, at the same time, in different parts.
As soon as this was completely effected, they left
her; and such was the rapidity of the flames,
that it was with the utmost difficulty they
preserved
the ketch. At this critical moment a
most propitious breeze sprang up, blowing
directly
out of the harbor, which, in a few
minutes
,
carried them beyond the reach of the
enemy's guns, and they made good their retreat
without the loss of a single man, and with but
four wounded.
32*
For this gallant and romantic achievement,
lieutenant Decatur was promoted to the rank of
post-captain, there being, at that time, no
intermediate
grade. This promotion was
particularly
gratifying to him, inasmuch as it was done with
the consent of the officers over whose heads he
was raised.
In the bombardment of Tripoli, on the
ensuing
spring, Decatur commanded one of the
divisions
of gun-boats, and captured one of the
enemy's boats by boarding. As he was about
to proceed out with his prize, a boat which had
been commanded by his brother came under his
stern, and informed him, that they had engaged
and captured one of the enemy; but that her
commander, after surrendering, had
treacherously
shot his brother, and pushed off with the boat,
and was then making for the harbor.
The feelings of the gallant Decatur, on
receiving
this intelligence, may more easily be
imagined than described. Every consideration
of prudence and safety, was lost in his eagerness
to punish so dastardly an act, and to revenge the
death of a brother so basely murdered? He
pushed within the enemy's line with his single
boat, and having succeeded in getting alongside
of the retreating foe, boarded her at the head of
eleven men, who were all the Americans he had
left.
The fate of this contest was extremely
doubtful
for twenty minutes. All the Americans
except
four were now severely wounded.
Decatur
singled out the commander, as the peculiar
object of his vengeance. The Turk was armed
with an espontoon, Decatur with a cutlass; in
attempting
to cut off the head of the weapon, his
sword struck on the iron, and broke close to the
hilt. The Turk at this moment made a push,
which slightly wounded him in the right arm and
breast. He immediately seized the spear and
closed with him. A fierce struggle ensued, and
both fell, Decatur uppermost. By this time, the
Turk had drawn a dagger from his belt, and was
about to plunge it in the body of his foe, when
Decatur caught his arm, and shot him with a
pistol
,
which he had taken from his pocket. During
the time they were struggling on the deck, the
crews rushed to the aid of their commanders,
and a most sanguinary conflict took place,
insomuch
,
that when Decatur had dispatched his
adversary, it was with the greatest difficulty he
could extricate himself from the killed and
wounded that had fallen around him.
During the early part of the struggle,
Decatur
was assailed in the rear by one of the enemy,
who had just aimed a blow at his head with his
sabre, that must have been fatal. At this fearful
juncture, a noble-hearted tar, who had been so
badly wounded as to lose the use of his hands,
seeing no other means of saving his commander,
rushed between him and the uplifted sabre, and
received the blow on his own head
, which fractured
his scull. The generous fellow survived, and
now receives a pension from government.
Decatur succeeded in getting with both of
his prizes to the squadron, and on the next day
received the highest commendation, in a general
order, from commodore Preble.
Such are the achievements by which this
gallant
officer had rendered himself immortal,
previous
to the capture of the Macedonian. May
he long live to enjoy his well-merited honors.
CHAPTER XLII.
AN UNSUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISE.
'Tis not in mortals to command success.
Cato
.
On
Monday, the fourth day of January, one
thousand eight hundred and thirteen, ensign
Willoughby
received official notice from the war
department, that he had been included in an
exchange
of prisoners which had been recently
effected. This information was accompanied
with a lieutenant's commission, bearing date
from the battle of Queenston, and orders to
proceed
to Albany, and report himself to general
Dearborn.
The blaze of glory which now streamed from
the ocean, had scattered the mists of prejudice
from the eyes of many politicians, who had
heretofore
opposed an increase of the naval
establishment
.
The eyes of Congress were at length
opened to the true interests of the nation, and an
act was immediately passed for building and
equipping four
seventy-fours
and six
forty-fours
.
Another act immediately followed for the further
increase and more perfect organization of the
army, which was to be augmented by an indefinite
number of regiments, whose term of service was
limited to twelve months. Many other measures
were also adopted by government, at the
commencement
of this year, for promoting the
success
of the American arms, both by sea and land.
When our hero arrived at the head-quarters of
the Northern army, he found that no operations
were on foot against the enemy. The troops on
the Niagara, under Smyth, (called the army of
the centre) after several fruitless attempts to
cross the river, had retired into winter-quarters,
and the volunteers had returned home, venting
their imprecations on their general, whom they
considered a vaporing braggart, destitute of
those talents which were necessary to lead an
army to conquest and glory. The Northern
army were also in winter-quarters, consisting of
less than six thousand men, including infantry,
cavalry, artillery, and militia. The only army
now in the field, was that under Harrison, who
continued to brave the inelemencies of a winter
campaign, determined to take no repose until
they had regained Detroit, and found
winter-quarters
in the enemy's country.
An unfortunate disaster, however, befel this
army on the twenty-second day of January, as
the reader will perceive by the following letter
from Major Willoughby to his son, which he
received on the tenth of February.
Mulberry-Grove
,
January
29, 1813.
MY DEAR BOY,
Yours
of the fifteenth December came
duly to hand, and has yielded me indescribable
pleasure. The unparalleled achievements of
our gallant sailors, must convince every man, not
blinded by prejudice, of the importance of a
respectable
naval establishment. This is a point
to which the strength and resources of our
country
can be directed with advantagewith honor
with complete success. Congress will become
convinced of this without a very long study in
that
dear school
you speak of.
O'Hara arrived here, after a journey of
twenty
days. The unexpected meeting had like to have
proved as fatal to his affectionate sister, as the
report of his death proved to his poor debilitated
father. His return has dressed the whole family
in smiles, which are at times, however, a little
overclouded by his expressing a determination
to enter on board the squadron, which is to be
established on Lake Erie.
When I wrote you last, every thing in the
Northwest was going on prosperously, and I had
no doubt but that my next would contain the
pleasing
intelligence of Harrison having recovered
all that Hull lost. But my present task is a less
pleasing one, for I am to announce a disaster,
which will long be felt and mourned by our
bleeding
country.
I think I told you, in my last, that the army
was proceeding from Fort Defiance towards the
Lake; but I forgot to mention a previous
circumstance
which I know will be interesting to
you
,
and which shall therefore be noticed in this place.
It is in some measure connected with the event I
allude to, and you will come to the melancholy
catastrophe soon enough.
Ever since the commencement of hostilities,
our old friend Logan (whom Hull, in his official
despatch represented as an enemy) has been
very solicitous to espouse the cause of the United
States,
[9]
[9]
In General Hull's official communication to
the Secretary of
War, giving his reason for surrendering Detroit
with the army to the
enemy, he says, Among the vast number of
chiefs who led the
hostile bands, Tecumseh, Marplot,
Logan

notwithstanding the flattering offers of
the British, which he had uniformly rejected and
spurned with contempt. Several other chiefs
who were wavering, and stood ready to lead
their followers to either standard, as
circumstances
might invite, entertained so much respect
for the opinions and example of Logan, that they
agreed to be governed by his decision. Of this
the British were well aware, and spared no
exertions
to win over to their cause a chieftain of
such acknowledged bravery and extensive
influence
.
But Logan possessed too much integrity to be
seduced into a cause which his soul condemned,
or to sell the services of his faithful followers to
support injustice and unwarrantable aggression.
Many a feudal lord in Christendom has, on a like
occasion, evinced less of the Christian spirit than
this heathen. He repeatedly solicited Harrison
to accept of his services; who, after
considerable
hesitation on the part of government, was
finally permitted to give him employment, and
he joined the American army, in September last,
when marching to relieve Fort Wayne, which,
you know, was then closely besieged. The army
approached that place on the evening of the
twelfth, when the invaders fled with precipitation.
Logan went forward with about seven hundred
of his men, raised an Indian yell, and pursued
the retreating tribes. The signal was answered
by them, at the distance of about one hundred
and fifty yards; but the intervention of the river,
and several other obstacles, prevented the
pursuit
being attended with effect.
Having thus raised the siege of Fort Wayne,
[10]
[10]
Fort Wayne is situated at the confluence of St.
Joseph's and
St. Maty's rivers, whose waters united form the river
called the
Miami of the Lakes, which empties into Erie. Two hundred
miles
below this fortress, stands Fort Defiance, (or, as it has
lately been
called, Fort Winchester) which is built on the point of
land formed by
the confluence of the
Aux
Glaize
with the Miami, about half way
between Fort Wayne and
Fort Meigs; the latter stands near the
rapids
of this river, and consequently not a great distance from
the
Lake.
Harrison and Winchester immediately made
preparations
for marching a sufficient number of
troops down the bank of the river, to relieve the
intermediate garrisons between that place and
Detroit. Through the exertions of our worthy
and patriotic governor,
[11]
[11]
His excellency R. J. Meigs, who was
afterwards appointed
PostMaster-General
of the United States.
every necessary supply
was forwarded with the greatest despatch to the
army, and Winchester advanced with about two
thousand men down the river towards Fort
Defiance
,
while Harrison fixed his head-quarters at
St. Mary's, about sixty miles apart. On
approaching
his place of destination, after a tedious
march of seven days, Winchester found the fort
in possession of the enemy, who were so strong
that he thought it imprudent to proceed; he
therefore sent to Harrison for reinforcements,
who immediately proceeded with general
Tupper's
mounted men, to the assistance of his friend.
The British and Indians, however, did not wait
to receive him; but, as soon as they heard of his
approach, evacuated the Fort, and took the
cannon
with them down the river towards the rapids.
A considerable period of inactivity
succeeded
this event. Harrison had departed to join the
right wing of the army, and to concentrate the
whole at an appointed rendezvous. Until this
concentration
could be effected, any further
movements
would not tend to promote the end in view.
But during this interval, Logan was sighing
for more active employment. Such deliberate
operations were not exactly congenial to his ideas
of carrying on the war; he wished to be in the
field with the enemy in front. While thus
goaded
by his own impatient ardor to act, a rumor had
reached his ears that the American officers had
expressed doubts of his boasted courage and
skill in war, as he had been so long with the
army
and done nothing. Logan either
fears
or
loves
the enemy. This was too much for
Logan
.
Stung to the soul, he immediately
demanded
employment, when Winchester permitted him
to take two of his followers, and proceed down
the river bank to examine the movements of the
enemy. In executing this service they had to
pass a narrow defile in the forest, from which an
ambuscade darted so suddenly upon them that
they were instantly made prisoners.
What must have been the feelings of Logan,
who, so far from having redeemed the reputation
which he imagined had been tarnished, was now
perhaps forever deprived of the power! The
party
which had captured them consisted of five
mounted warriors, under the command of the
celebrated
Wynemack
. Nothing but a stratagem
could rescue the prisoners, and Logan's ready
invention
quickly contrived one. He addressed
himself
to Wynemack, expressing much surprise at
such hostile treatment of men who had risked so
much in coming to join them. Since you see we
are friends, (he added) there is no time to be lost;
follows us, and an encampment of white men can
be surprised and destroyed. The credulous
victors believed him, and permitted their three
captives to lead them on to the anticipated
massacre
.
33
Logan having communicated to his
comrades
his determination to rescue himself, or
perish
in the effort, they wheeled suddenly on their
enemy, and each brought his man to the ground:
Wynemack being one of the fallen. The
remaining
three instantly returned the fire, (which
wounded Logan and one of his men) and then
made off. Logan exchanged the shot,
notwithstanding
his wound was mortal; and springing
with his wounded companion, upon the horses of
two of those whom they had just killed, whilst his
third man protected him in his retreat, he
returned
to the fort. This happened on the
twenty-second
of November; on the twenty-eighth he
expired
,
with the firmness of a brave warrior,
sincerely
regretted by the whole garrison.
Thus has our faithful, generous friend split
his life's blood in the cause of American freedom;
being the second of the name whom the history of
our country will notice for his attachment to her
cause. His brave and enterprising son, who is
now in the field, will be the third; be forever
grateful, George, that you was made the
instrument
of preserving a life which will always be
devoted
to the defence of our country.
Some time after the foregoing event, the left
wing of the army, under Winchester, marched
from Fort Defiance down to the rapids, in
conformity
to the order of Harrison, who had removed
his head-quarters to Upper Sandusky. In the
mean time, from the movements of the enemy, the
inhabitants of Frenchtown, on the river Raisin,
became so seriously alarmed, that they solicited
Winchester to march immediately to their
protection
,
although the troops at that time under his
command were far inferior in numbers to the
collected
force of the British and Indians by whom
the village was menaced. In compliance with
this earnest solicitation, but without the authority
or knowledge of the commander in chief,
Winchester
determined upon marching, with his small
force, (then reduced to eight hundred men, by
the discharge of those regiments whose term of
service had expired) to prevent, if possible, the
destruction of the village, and the massacre of
the inhabitants. Very wrong as a soldier, but
very right as a man.
Colonel Lewis marched first, with his
detachment
,
which was to be joined on the way by that
of lieutenant-colonel Allen, and followed by the
main body under Winchester himself. On
approaching
Frenchtown, Lewis was informed that
about five hundred of the enemy were already
encamped
in the village; and, without hesitation,
determined to attack them. The charge was
impetuous
and successful; he carried the picketing
of their right wing with ease, dislodged both
British
and Indians, and drove them into the woods.
Allen, with his detachment, made a simultaneous
attack on the left, with the same success. Twice
did the enemy rally, and renew the contest with
desperation, and thrice were they compelled to
retreat in disorder, and were finally entirely
dispersed
.
In this conflict much blood was spilt on
both sides.
Lewis encamped on the same ground which
had been occupied by the enemy, and was, in two
days after, joined by Winchester with the
remainder
of his troops, now amounting in all to
about seven hundred and fifty effective men. Six
hundred were posted in pickets, and the rest
encamped
in an open field.
On the morning of the twenty-second instant,
at revellee, Proctor and Tecumseh, at the head of
above two thousand men, attacked the
encampment
so suddenly that many of the Americans
were literally cut to pieces. They were soon
formed, however, and after repelling the
assailants
for some time with unparalleled coolness
and intrepidity, the combatants closed in a
promiscuous
fray. The contest was now long,
obstinate
,
and sanguinary; but more like a
massacre
than a regular battle. Winchester's quarters
were several hundred yards from the
encampment
,
to which he had scarcely arrived when he
was taken prisoner. Seeing his brave
countrymen
desperately contending with such superior
force, and covering the field with their slain,
Winchester
sent a flag to the field and advised a
surrender
,
which advice was complied with. The
loss of the Americans was
two hundred and
ninety-seven
men killed and missing
, twenty-two of whom
were officers. Only twenty-five were wounded,
which shows the desperate valor with which the
contest was maintainedevery wound was a
death, with this trifling exception. The loss of
the enemy was not less, but could not be
ascertained
,
as they resorted to their usual means of
preventing a discovery, by removing the
bodies
,
&c.
But the most horrid part of my story is yet
to be told. The express conditions of the
surrender
werethat the Americans should be
protected
from the fury of the savages; that private
property should be respected, and that the
sidearms
of the officers should be returned. Not one
of these conditions was complied with. No
sooner
had the Americans relinquished their arms,
than they were robbed of every thing, under
uplifted
tomahawks and scalping-knives, and
stripped
even of their personal apparel. Every
prisoner
whose wounds rendered him unable to
march to Malden, was murdered and scalped on
the spot, and all who gave out on the way,
shared
the same bloody fate. Many of the houses in
Frenchtown were wantonly burnt, and several
defenceless
inhabitants, who had not been in the
engagement
,
inhumanly butchered without
provocation
.
To be sure, all these atrocities were
committed by Indiansbut their white allies did
not raise a finger to prevent them. The blood
rests on British heads.
The barbarities of the enemy, (both white
and red) are shocking beyond conception; and,
as judge Woodward told Proctor, will one day
meet the steady and impartial eye of history.
Dr. M`Keehan, surgeon's mate to the second
regiment
of our Ohio militia, was sent to Malden
under
the protection of a flag, to attend to the sick and
wounded prisoners. But regardless of the
sanctity
of his flag, he was fired upon by the enemy,
near the rapids, his companion killed, himself
wounded, and he is now in close confinement as a
spy!
General Armstrong, I understand, has been
appointed secretary of war, in the room of
Eustis
,
who has resigned. Write often, and
believe
me to be, as ever, your affectionate father,

CHAPTER XLIII.
A BRILLIANT SET-OFF.
And all the
clouds

In the deep bosom of the
ocean
buried.
Shakspeare

PARAPHRASE.
All the gloomy clouds that hover
O'er the cheerless Western plain,
Shall Atlantic billows cover,
Ocean wash out every stain.
On
the twentieth day of February, our hero,
(who had written to Morse an account of
Winchester's
defeat, as recorded in the foregoing
chapter) received the following answer, a copy of
which he immediately forwarded to his father.
Boston, Mas.
February
16, 1813.
I hasten, my dear brother, to furnish an
antidote
to the melancholy which the writing of your
last must have occasioned.
Another British frigate has been captured
and sunk by the staunch old Constitution; but
our friend and cousinthe amiable Aylwin,
sleeps with
the brave, who sink to rest,
With all their country's honors blest.
This will, of course, be a drawback on your
pleasure
;
but when you reflect (as I know you will)
that his short life was marked with every trait of
virtue and honor, that he fell in the service of his
country, covered with glory, and that to those
who have lived like Aylwin, death is only the
commencement of a more glorious lifeI say
when you reflect on these things, you may with
me regret the loss of his society, but will not be
so selfish as to wish to recall him. His virtues
belonged to his immortal part, and can never die.
His friendship we shall still enjoy, and to his
society
we shall one day be restored.
A friend, when dead, is but removed from sight,
Sunk in the lustre of eternal light;
And when the parting storms of life are o'er,
May yet rejoin us on a happier shore.
The Constitution arrived at this port
yesterday
,
and lieutenant Ludlow has proceeded to the
seat of government with Bainbridge's official
despatch
to the secretary of the navy, and the colors
of the vanquished enemy; which was his
Britannic
majesty's frigate Java, of forty-nine guns and
four hundred and fifty men. I conversed a few
minutes with Ludlow, who gave me the following
account:
The action took place on the twenty-ninth of
December, (the very day on which captain Hull,
the former Commander of the constitution, was a
guest at the dinner given by the corporation and
citizens of New-York, in honor of the exploits of
our naval heroes) in latitude thirteen, about ten
leagues from the coast of Brazil, and lasted one
hour and fifty-five minutes; in which time the
Java
was made a complete wreck, having her
bowsprit
and every mast and spar shot out of her.
The Constitution had nine killed and twenty-five
wounded. The Java had sixty killed and about
a hundred wounded. Among the latter was her
commander, Lambert, a very distinguished
officer
,
mortally. From a letter written by one of
her officers whilst on board the Constitution, it is
evident that the wounded must have been
considerably
greater, and many must have died of their
wounds previous to removal. The letter states
sixty killed and a hundred and seventy wounded.
Aylwin commanded the forecastle division,
and Ludlow assured me that his bravery and
marked coolness throughout the contest, gained
him the admiration of his commander, and all who
had an opportunity of witnessing him. When
boarders were called to repel boarders, he
mounted
the quarter-deck hammock cloths, and, in the
act of firing his pistols at the enemy, he received
a ball through the same shoulder in which he was
wounded before. Notwithstanding the serious
nature of his wound, he continued at his post
until
the enemy had struck; and even then did not
make known to the surgeon his own situation, nor
until all the wounded had been dressed. His zeal
and courage did not forsake him in his last
moments
:
for a few days after the action, although
laboring under considerable debility, and the
most excruciating pain, he left his state-room, and
repaired to quarters, when an engagement was
expected with a ship, which afterwards proved
to be the Hornet. He bore his pain with great
and unusual fortitude, and expired, without a
groan, on the twenty-eighth of January.
A dauntless soul erect, who smiled on death.
The Java was rated at thirty-eight guns, but
mounted forty-nine. She was just out of dock,
and fitted in the most complete manner to carry
out lieutenant-general Hislop, governor of
Bombay
,
and his staff; captain Marshal, a
commander
in the British navy, and a number of naval
officers going to join the British ships of war in
the East Indies. Besides these, and having her
own complement of officers and men complete,
she had upwards of one hundred supernumeraries
of petty officers and seamen for the admiral's ship
and other vessels on the East India station. She
also had despatches from the British government
for St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and
every
British establishment in the East Indies and
China seas, and had copper on board for a
seventy-four
gun ship and two sloops of war, building
at Bombay, and it is presumed many other
valuables
,
all of which were blown up in her on the
thirty-first of December, when she was set on fire.
The Constitution was considerably cut in her
spars, rigging, and sails; but not so much injured
but that she could have commenced another
action
immediately after the capture of the Java,
which latter vessel was made a perfectly
unmanageable
wreck.
A seaman on board the Constitution, named
John Cheeves, was mortally wounded, and whilst
lying on the deck apparently dying, the word was
passed that the enemy had struck. He raised
himself up with one hand, gave three cheers, fell
back, and expired! Heroic specimen of the
genuine patriotism of American tars! His brother
was also wounded, and has since died. They
have left an aged and helpless mother at
Marblehead
,
who depended entirely on the fruits of their
industry for a subsistence.
The news of this third achievement of our
favorite Constitution was announced from the
stage by Mr. Powell, the manager, last evening,
and was received with repeated acclamations.
Rodgers and Hull, with their ladies, and several
other officers of the navy, were present, and
received
congratulations on the event.
Gentlemen who have been on board the
Constitution
,
which still lies in the lower harbor,
mention
having learnt that Bainbridge received two
wounds in the action, one by a musket ball, the
other by langrage; that the Java was well fought
and bravely defended; and though the
Constitution
could have been prepared for another battle
immediately, she was very considerably injured
in her spars, sails, bulwarks, &c.
The Constitution has on board part of the
cargo of the schooner Helen, from London for St.
Salvador, captured by the Hornet, captain
Lawrence
,
off the latter port; the schooner was given
up.
The Java touched at St. Jago, Cape de
Verds, and learned that the Essex, captain Porter,
had been thereand supposing the Constitution
to be that frigate, with carronades only, kept at
long shot, which prolonged the action. They
learned by the officers of the Java that the Essex
had captured a sloop of war, and four rich prizes.
The Hornet was left off St. Salvador,
watching
the British sloop of war Bonne Citoyenne,
said to have on board one million seven hundred
thousand dollars. Captain Lawrence had
challenged
the British captain to come out and try the
fortune of war with him, but the wary
Englishman
declined the combat. They begin to
respect
Yankee cock-boats.
All the officers and seamen taken in the Java,
were paroled by commodore Bainbridge, and
landed on the third of January at St. Salvador,
Brazils.
Honors are now lavished on Decatur and
Jones similar to those which Hull has received.
Bainbridge's turn comes nextand who next?
Perhaps Rodgers; he strives hard to find the
enemy, and would no doubt give a good account
of them should he meet them. He arrived at this
port on New-Year's day, at the same hour the
Macedonian entered the harbor of New-York,
through the Sound. Admiral Warren has arrived
off that port, with a considerable squadron, and
has expressed his determination to lay the whole
coast, south of New-York, under a most strict and
rigorous blockade. Our privateers are doing
wonders.
Your friends here are all enjoying good
health, and Amelia desires to be particularly
remembered
to her dear brother. You have
been an
uncle
above six weeks, and Amelia
insists
upon calling the infant Catharine. You
know how to appreciate this compliment. Adieu.
EDGAR MORSE.
CHAPTER XLIV.
THE FIFTH NAVAL GARLAND.
Be it my country's richer glory far
With deeds of love to blunt the rage of war;
Her sonsdread demons to the opposing foe
Angels of mercy, o'er a chief laid low.
Such are the wreaths Columbia's brows that twine,
And much I glory that I call her mine.
Smith's Heroes of the Lake
.
It
was now determined by government that
the next operations against the enemy, should be
an attack on Little York, the capital of Upper
Canada, followed (if successful) by another on
Kingston, and both to be succeeded by the
capture
of Fort George, Erie, and their
dependencies
.
To effect these grand objects, Dearborn
immediately
commenced the most rigorous
preparations
.
Reinforcements of regulars from every
recruiting district were continually arriving, and
the necessary supplies of provisions and military
equipments were forwarded to the army with the
greatest celerity.
General Brown was with his family at
Brownsville
,
and Ogdensburgh was commanded by the
enterprising Forsyth, who had several times
repeated
his successful visits to the enemy's public
store-houses, magazines, and military depots. On
the twenty-first of February, however, the
exasperated
enemy appeared before Ogdensburg, with
a force of twelve hundred men; and, after an
obstinate
contest, compelled Forsyth to evacuate the
post, after losing twenty men in killed and
wounded
.
The loss of the enemy was three times that
number. The British commandant at Fort George
was so elated with this trifling affair, that, in the
pride of his heart, he sent a message to colonel
M`Feely, the American commandant of Fort
Niagara
,
informing him that a salute would be fired
the next day at twelve o'clock, in honor of the
capture of the American village. No immediate
reply was made to this insulting message; but in
the course of the same evening the news of
Bainbridge's
victory reached the American
commandant
,
who dispatched a message to the exulting
Englishman, with the compliments of colonel
M`Feely, and the information that a national
salute
would be fired at the same hour,
in honor of
the capture and destruction of his Britannic
majesty's
frigate Java, by a Yankee cock-boat
.
On the twenty-seventh of March, our hero
received
a letter from Morse, which commenced in
the following manner:
Boston
,
March
21, 1813.
Another Naval Victory
, my dear George,
has rewarded the courage and enterprise of
American
sailors, and the name of
Lawrence
is now
inscribed with those of Hull, Decatur, Jones, and
Bainbridge, on an imperishable pillar of glory.
On the twenty-fourth day of February last,
while cruising off Demarara, the American sloop
of war Hornet, commanded by captain Lawrence,
fell in with the British brig Peacock, captain
Peake, and captured her, after a sanguinary
action
of
fourteen minutes
. The contest
commenced
within half pistol shot, and so tremendous was
the fire of the Americans, that when she
surrendered
she was an absolute wreck, in a sinking
condition, displaying a signal of distress.
Notwithstanding
every exertion was made to keep
34
her afloat until the prisoners could be removed,
she sunk with thirteen of her crew, and three
brave American tars, who thus nobly perished in
relieving a conquered foe.
The slaughter on board of the Peacock was
very severe; among the slain was found the body
of her commander, captain Peake. He was twice
wounded in the course of the action; the last
wound proved fatal. His body was wrapped in
the flag of his ship, and laid in the cabin to sink
with her; a shroud and sepulchre worthy so brave
a sailor.
It is a fact worthy of note, and in the highest
degree honorable to our brave tars, that on the
day succeeding the destruction of the Peacock,
the crew of the Hornet made a subscription and
supplied the prisoners (who had lost almost every
thing) with two shirts and a jacket and trowsers
each.
It is singular, that in this action, when the first
broadsides were exchanged at half pistol shot,
the pendant on the mainmast of the Hornet was
shot away, one man was killed in the top, and the
upper rigging much injured, but no mark of a
ball was seen below the main-top. The Hornet's
fire had quite a different effect on the Peacock;
it was so well directed, that several of the shot
pierced the hull of the Peacock through and
through, killed a number of men, and, in a
measure
,
decided the contest.
This victory (says a morning paper) will
excite
afresh the wonder of the world! The sinking
the British sloop of war Peacock, by the United
States sloop of war Hornet, in
fifteen
minutes, will
fill England with amazement and dismay. The
Peacock was as large a vessel as the Hornet, and
carried more guns. To cut this ship to pieces,
to kill and wound between thirty and forty of
her men, while the American ship lost but
one
killed and two wounded
, is a circumstance so
extraordinary
,
that it impresses the minds of our
countrymen with an exultation mixed with
solemnity
!
Is it merely our prowessor is it the
finger of Heaven pointing to the path of our
future
glory? These successes fill not the mind with
a noisy and giddy joy, but with a solemn and
grateful sentiment towards that Power which
controls
the world, and giveth us the victory, by
teaching our hands to war, and our fingers to
fight!
But enough, for the present, of `blood
stained
glory.' Accompany me, for a few minutes, in
the humbler walks of civil and domestic life, and
let the subject of our contemplation be
Woman
,
`Heaven's last, best gift to man.' Harriet
Palmer
,
whose gentle manners, amiable disposition,
and unassuming excellence, had secured her the
love of all her acquaintancehas gone to taste the
fruits of virtue in `another and a better world.'
Amelia and myself have just returned from
paying
the last sad duties to her mortal part, which
has just been committed to its kindred earth.
Her affectionate parents are in the deepest
affliction
,
having previously received some
distressing
intelligence respecting Sophia, who married
the old German, in New-York, where she has
since resided. I am ignorant of the particulars,
but believe that the connexion is not productive
of the promised felicity. It was a
money match
,
and they are seldom happy. This circumstance,
it is believed, hastened the death of Harriet
Yet other secret griefs had she,
O pillow! only told to thee:
Say, did not hopeless love intrude
On her poor bosom's solitude?
Be this as it may, her little earthly drama is
concluded, and the curtain dropped. Her
character
was amiable, chaste, and correctand for
filial affection and domestic virtues, she has not
left her equalnor will the slightest blemish ever
be discovered on the spotless purity of her fame.
Whatever may have been her secret sorrows, she
is now (I have no doubt) a happy angel in that
permanent world of which this is but an
imperfect
shadow, like the broken image of a beautiful
landscape reflected from the trembling surface of
a troubled lake.
All, all on earth is shadowall beyond
Is substance; the reverse is folly's creed.
How solid all where change shall be no more!
Who can be ashamed to pay homage to a
virtuous woman? It should be our ambitionour
pride. She is the purest abstract of Deity that
can be found in all his works. She is the image
of love, of purity, and truthand she lives and
moves in the person of Amelia.
Woman
ever has been, still is, and always
will be, the main spring, the
primum mobile
of
every masculine achievement, from the hero to
the clownfrom the man to the stripling; and
whether she fire a Troy, or excite emulation in a
game at marbles; whether she influence a court
or rule in a dairy, the end, cause, and effect, are
still the same. We may talk of Patriotismwe
may prate of Fame; but who could feel the one,
or seek the other, but for the sake of woman?
In every character WOMAN is interesting,
though not always amiablewe may not love, but
we must admire. Whether as the venerable
matron
,
or the blooming maid; the chaste wife, or the
affectionate mistress; the tender sister, or the
blushing bride; old or young, married or
unmarried
,
virtuous or viciousstill she will
command
our admiration, and influence our actions.
You will not condemn me for enthusiasm, for
you
are no stoic. I know that there are some
hearts, cut by capricious Fate from the icy
coagulations
of the poles, or moulded from the frozen
snow-drifts of Siberia, that are not susceptible of
softening in the brightest rays that emanate from
celestial beauty. There
are
such heartsbut
let their possessors forbear to boast of them; they
are the mere abortions of Naturethe eternal
foes of genius; mere thistles and night-shade in
the garden of creation.
For them no fancy consecrates the scene.
You know the rest of this beautiful passage in
Campbell's `Pleasures of Hope,' ending thus:
And say, without our hopes, without our fears,
Without the home that plighted love endears;
Without the smile from partial beauty won;
O what were man? A world without a sun.
Blest with their smiles, this world becomes a
heavenwithout them, heaven itself would lose
half its charms. O that you could have
witnessed
Amelia at the death-bed of Harriet Palmer!
Never before did she appear so lovelyh in my
eyes. Day after day, and night after night, has
she watched by the pillow of her friend,
administering
34*
her medicine, sustaining her head on her
bosom, and wiping the clammy dews of death
from her sunken cheeks. O George, it is in such
a scene that lovely woman shines, and until I saw
your sister thus employed, I did not half
appreciate
the treasure I possess in that angel of
humanity
.
Heaven grant me grace to be duly
thankful for the gift.
Playful and artless, on the summer wave,
Sporting with buoyant wing, the fairy scene
With fairest grace adorning; but in wo,
In poverty, in soul-subduing toils,
In patient tending on the sick man's bed,
In ministerings of love, in bitterest pangs,
Faithful and firm;in scenes where sterner hearts
Have crack'd, still cheerful and still kind.
Our hero had scarcely finished reading this
letter
,
when a lad entered his apartment, and
advancing
timidly forward, with a very modest
deportment, inquired
Is lieutenant Willoughby in want of an
attendant
,
during the approaching campaign?
George (who was now folding a letter which
he had written previous to receiving Morse's)
was on the point of answering in the negative;
but on contemplating the applicant a moment, he
was struck with something peculiarly interesting
in his melancholy countenance and diffident
manners
,
which induced him to prolong the interview.
He therefore asked him
Who wants a situation in that capacity?
Myself, sir; replied the lad; and if I am
permitted to serve
you
, the gratitude I shall feel
will always be a spur to my duty.
Have you ever served as an officer's waiter?
No, sir; but I feel fully competent to
discharge
the duties of one, and shall study
diligently
to become acquainted with them.
I am much deceived, replied George, or
you possess education and talents superior to the
situation you are seeking. What then can be
your object?
I feel an enthusiastic predilection for a
military
life, sir, but am too young for a soldier. To
be the personal attendant of a brave officer,
during
one campaign, will at once gratify my taste,
and gradually initiate me into a profession I am
determined to adopt. Will you employ me?
How old are you?
A little more than fourteen.
What is your name?Who are your
parents
?
My name is Reuben, and I am an orphan.
My education has been good, and my prospects
in life were brilliant; I looked forward to nothing
but happiness. A mercenary relation, however,
under whose protection I was placed, actuated by
motives of avarice only, bound me an apprentice
to a trade I hated and a master I despised. With
him, servitude was slavery, and I yet bear the
marks of his cruelty on my person. I at length
became wearied of existence, and determined to
leave him; and he, suspecting my intention,
watched me so very narrowly, that it was some
time before I could elude his vigilance, and make
my escape, which I at length effected in the night,
and immediately set out for the army, determined
to seek you, and solicit your protection.
Why
me?
asked George; Do you know
me?
Only by reputation, sir, answered Reuben;
though I have frequently seen you in Boston.
Our hero thought the countenance and voice
were both familiar to him; but he could not
recollect
the person of the lad. It was very
probable
,
however, that he had seen him in Boston.
He surveyed him a moment in silence, and then
asked
What are your terms?
Just such as you please to propose.
I will employ you. When do you wish to
commence?
Immediately, replied Reuben with alacrity,
while his countenance brightened with a smile of
pleasure.
To-day? asked our hero.
This moment, if you please.
Content. Take this note to the quarters of
lieutenant Cooke, and leave it without waiting for
an answer.
Reuben was overjoyed at his success, and
expressed
his gratitude and affection by kissing the
hand from which he received the letter; then,
making a graceful bow, he flew to execute his
commission.
CHAPTER XLV.
THE ENEMY IN VIEW.
There is a solemn hour, whose tremor dread
May reach the heart, and not affect the head;
But 'tis not when the ambush's loudest cry,
In sudden onset, rolls along the sky;
It comes not mid the battle's mingled roar,
It comes,
the silent interval before
;
When all the powers that solemnize the soul
In awful calmness o'er the future roll;
Survey with pain the unnatural strife of death,
And count the victims doom'd to yield their breath:
Behold the widow's tears that o'er them flow,
And hear the helpless orphan's cry of wo.
Smith's Heroes of the Lake
.
Every
preparation was now completed, and
the squadron being in readiness to transport the
American troops across the lake to the enemy's
country, they began to embark, at Sacket's
Harbor
,
on Thursday the twenty-second day of April.
This expedition was conducted by Dearborn,
who had about seventeen hundred men under his
command. The execution of that part of the plan
which applied immediately to the attack upon
York, was confided to general Pike, a gentleman
who had recently been promoted, for his merits,
from the rank of colonel to that of
brigadier-general
.
Almost from his cradle, Pike had been trained
to a military life, having entered the army while
a boy, and served some time as a cadet in his
father's company, then stationed on the western
frontiers. At an early age he obtained the
commission
of ensign, and shortly after that of
lieutenant
of infantry. With no other education than
such as is afforded by the most ordinary village
school, he commenced his military career; but by
his own industry and perseverance, without the
aid of a teacher, he had acquired the Latin,
French, and Spanish languages, and a competent
knowledge of mathematics.
At the age of twenty-two, he married the
amiable
Miss Clarissa Brown, of Cincinnati, and for
several years afterwards reposed in the bosom of
domestic felicity; panting, however, for an
opportunity
of gratifying his ruling passion, the love
of a military life and a thirst for glory.
One little circumstance which will tend to throw
some light on the amiable character of this gallant
officer, shall here be noticed. A short time after
his marriage he presented his wife with a little
pocket volume of the conomy of Human
Life, in the blank pages of which he had been
in the habit of inserting such maxims of morality,
or sentiments of honor, as occurred in his reading,
or were suggested by his own reflections. Among
other articles of this description, was the
following
:
Should my country call for the sacrifice of
that life which has been devoted to her service
from early youth, most willingly shall she receive
it. The sod which covers the
brave
, shall be
moistened by the tears of
love
and
friendship;
but
if I fall far from my friends and from you, my
Clara
,
remember, that `the choicest tears which are
ever shed, are those which bedew the unburied
head of a soldier'and when these lines shall
meet the eyes of our young son, let the pages of
this little book be impressed on his mind, as a
gift of a father who had nothing to bequeath but
his honor: and let these two short maxims be ever
present to his mind, as he rises from youth to
manhood
:
1.
Preserve your honor free from blemish
.
2.
Be always ready to die for your country
.
When Pike had been married about four years,
he was employed by government to explore the
Mississippi to its source, which perilous
expedition
he commenced, with a few faithful and
enterprising
soldiers, and executed in eight months
and twenty-two days; during which period the
party were continually exposed to hardships and
dangershunger and cold. He returned in April,
one thousand eight hundred and six, having
honorably accomplished every part of the trust
confided to him.
In the July following, he commenced a similar
tour up the Missouri and Osage rivers; which he
successfully accomplished, after much privation
and suffering, in little less than twelve months;
when he received the thanks of his government
for these important services, and a rapid
promotion
in the army of his country.
Having served through every gradation of
rank, from a private to a general, and acquired
reputation in each, he now possessed the full and
entire confidence of his commander in chief, the
love of the soldiers, and the respect of all ranks
and classes of men. He was in the full vigor of
life and health, of tried and approved courage,
and intimately acquainted with all the minut of
discipline. No wonder, that in such a man the
discernment of Dearborn should discover every
requisite of an able leader, admirably calculated
to head the expedition he had undertaken.
On the evening before the squadron sailed,
Pike addressed an affectionate letter to his father,
which contained the following sentences:
I embark to-morrow in a fleet from Sacket's
Harbor, at the head of a column of fifteen
hundred
choice troops, on a secret expedition. If
success attends my steps, honor and glory await
my nameif defeat, still shall it be said we died
like brave men, and conferred honor, even in
death, on the American name.
Should I be the happy mortal destined to
turn the scale of war, will not you rejoice, O my
father? May Heaven be propitious and smile on
the cause of my country! But if we are destined
to fall, may my fall be like Wolf'sto sleep in
the arms of victory.
Pike's principal aid, on this expedition, was
ensign Fraser, a young gentleman whose name
will be transmitted to posterity with honor, in
every history of that war, the events of which
I have here undertaken to record.
[12]
[12]
The particular friend of Fraser, (alluded to in the note on page
107) was distinguished for his gallantry and patriotism on a very
important
occasion during the late war, as noticed in the proper place.
His name is Bartholomew Delapierre.
From the
course of reading to which he had accustomed
himself, he imbibed an early propensity for a
military life, and had been lieutenant of a rifle
company in Philadelphia, and an ensign in a
corps of the same description in New-York,
previous
to his entering the regular army. At the
age of twenty-one, he found his country involved
in a contest for her rights, and, therefore,
obtained
an ensign's commission (in the regiment of
which Pike was then colonel) that he might
assist
in chastising the haughty enemies of
American
freedom and independence.
Here his zeal, and his attention to discipline,
could not fail to attract the notice of his
commander
,
who appointed him police-officer to the
regiment
,
and complimented him highly in regimental
orders. Pike afterwards selected him for his
secretary
,
and on being promoted to the rank of
brigadier-general
,
announced ensign Fraser as his
aid-de-camp, and as such, he was now about to
embark with his general on an important and
hazardous expedition.
Lieutenant Willoughby, having addressed a
short letter to his father, and a long one to his
Catharine, and having taken leave of his friends
at the Harbor, went on board the fleet, on
Saturday
evening, the twenty-fourth of April, attended
by his faithful and affectionate Reuben, to whom
he had gradually become so strongly attached,that
he now loved him as a brother, and treated him
more like a companion than a servant. They
set sail the next morning, with a fair wind, and
soon lost sight of the American shore.
On Monday evening, the town of Little-York
appeared in view, when the squadron shortened
sail, and laid to for the night. The plan of
attack
was formed by Pike himself, and clearly and
minutely detailed in his general orders, which
were directed to be read at the head of every
corps; every field officer was also directed to
carry a copy of them, in order that he might at
any moment refer to them,and give an explanation
to his subordinates. Every thing was arranged,
and every probable exigency provided for, with
admirable method and precision.
35
The following extract from these orders,
breathes so much of the spirit of an American, that
the reader will never regret its being inserted in
this history:
No man will load until ordered, except the
light troops in front, until within a short distance
of the enemy, and then charge bayonets; thus
letting the enemy see, that we can meet them with
their own weapons. Any man firing or quitting
his post without orders, must be put to instant
death, as an example may be necessary.
Platoon
officers will pay the greatest attention to the
coolness and aim of their men in the fire; their
regularity and dressing in the charge. The field
officers will watch over the conduct of the whole.
Courage and bravery in the field do not more
distinguish
the soldier, than
humanity after victory;
and whatever example the savage allies of our
enemies may have given us, the general
confidently
hopes, that
the blood of an unresisting or
yielding enemy, will never stain the weapons of the
soldiers of his column
.
The unoffending citizens of Canada are
many
of them our own countrymen, and the poor
Canadians have been forced into the war. Their
property, therefore, must be held sacred; and any
soldier who shall so far neglect the honor of his
profession as to be guilty of plundering the
inhabitants
,
shall, if convicted, be punished with death.
But the commanding general assures the troops,
that should they capture a large quantity of
public
stores, he will use his best endeavors to
procure
them a reward from his government.
Every arrangement being completed, the
approach
of morning was awaited in the most
anxious
suspense. How many in this little fleet
were to see the rising sun, who were never to
behold
it set! How many were now gazing at the
spangled firmament of heaven, whose eyes were
to be soon forever closed on all material things!
Such reflections could never disgrace a hero, and
such reflections were indulged by the veteran
Dearborn, the valiant Pike, the intrepid Fraser,
the gallant Willoughby, and many other brave
spirits, who were gazing on the shore which was
so soon to be drenched with the mingled blood of
friends and foes.
Our hero, who felt no inclination to quit the
deck, was awakened from a profound reverie, by a
deep-drawn sigh, succeeded by half-stifled sobs;
and advancing to the spot from whence the sounds
proceeded, he found Reuben, leaning over the
vessel's side, and dimpling the waves with his
tears. He was evidently embarrassed at his
master's
approach, and endeavored to conceal his
disorder.
Not drooping, I hope? inquired George,
with an affectionate tone, at the same time taking
his hand. Cheer up, my lad, and think of the
glory that awaits us to-morrow!
Reuben found it difficult to return any answer,
without betraying an agitation he would gladly
have concealed. At length, however, he
assumed
sufficient composure to reply
Think not, my dear sir, that I feel any fear
on my own account; but, oh, sir, if the result of
to-morrow's engagement should deprive me of
your friendship and protection, what would
become
of me?
It is not wise, Reuben, to anticipate evil,
but to meet it like a man when it comes; who
would capitulate to a distant enemy? It is
certainly
soon enough when he demands a surrender.
If I should fall, to-morrow, we shall be a short
time separated; but while you are virtuous you
will never want for a friend or protectorGod
will be your friendwhat evil can then befall
you?
I cannot dispute your observations, replied
Reuben, but it affords me no consolation. I
know of no friend but you, and I would so repine
to lose you, that I should forfeit all claims to the
friendship and protection of Heaven.
Come, come, my little friend, replied our
hero
,
banish despondency, and trust to
Providence
for the event of our present enterprise.
Recollect that you have chosen the profession of
arms, and the soldier who doubts, is damned.
There are only two classes of soldiers who can
ever be useful to their countrythey who confide
solely in Providence, and they who place all
confidence
in themselves. The former fight from a
sense of duty--the latter from a thirst of fame or the
meaner passions of revenge, hatred, or gain. The
former are always serene, cool, deliberate, and
collected; the same in victory or defeat, in
success
or disaster, in life or death. The latter are
demons in battle, tyrants in victory, blasphemers
in defeat, and cowards in death. The former
know and acknowledge that the result of every
contest will be ordered by Heaven for the best
the latter think that no result can be good but
what tends to the gratification of their own selfish
wishes. The former are ever ready, the latter
ever eager to be led to the fray. Both fight well,
but from very different motives. To one of these
classes, must my Reuben belong, if he ever
acquires
military fame; for all others are negative
soldiers, lukewarm cowards, that only disgrace
an army and retard its operations. Let me
entreat
you to study faithfully the two characters I
have mentioned, and choose the former for your
model. Begin the lesson now, by convincing
yourself, as you easily can, from reason and
Scripture, that the Judge of all the earth does
right, and that not even a sparrow can fall to the
ground without the permission of that Being who
permits nothing (not even evil) but for the
promotion
of ultimate good. We ought, therefore, to
feel proud that the death of such insignificant
beings
as we are, can be instrumental of furthering
the plans of Providence, the object and end of
which is the good of his creatures.
While this conversation was passing between
our hero and his timid young friend, Fraser was
receiving from his general a private and delicate
commission. It was a sealed letter, with this
injunction
Neither
of us can foresee the fate of
to-morrow's contest; therefore, should I fall, and
you survive, hand this
yourself
to Mrs. Pike.
Fraser received the sacred trust, and Pike
resumed
the examination of a map which was spread on
the table before him.
The letter which he had thus entrusted to the
care of his aid, had just been written, and the
exercise
had in some measure lightened a sullen
weight that hung upon his minda painful
presentiment
of evil, which all the busy
arrangements
of the evening had not tended to dissipate.
It was addressed to his wife, and the following is
a literal transcript of the original copy:
35*
My dear Clara
,
We are now standing on and off the harbor
of York, which we shall attack at day-light in
the morning. I shall dedicate these last moments
to you, my love, and to-morrow throw all other
ideas but my country to the winds. As yet I
know not if general Dearborn lands; he has
acted
honorably so far, and I feel great gratitude to
the old gentleman: my sword and pen shall both
be exerted to do him honor. I have no new
injunction
no
new charge to give you; nor any
new idea to communicate; yet we love to
commune
with those we love, more especially when
we conceive it may be the last time in this world.
Should I fall, defend my memory: and only
believe
,
had I lived, I would have aspired to deeds
worthy of your husband. Remember me with a
father's lovea father's care, to our dear
daughter
,
and believe me to be, with the warmest
sentiments
of love and friendship, your
MONTGOMERY.
Heaven avert so disastrous an event!
silently
ejaculated Fraser, as he consigned the
letter
to his pocket-book; and when I take it
hence, may it be to return it into the writer's
victorious
hand. If I fallhe thought of his
parents

Every circumstance recorded in these pages respecting this
gallant
young officer, is copied from a
biographical sketch
, handed me
by one of his most intimate friends and companions, who, having
fought by his side, was a witness of his valor, and is desirous of
having
it placed on permanent record. The author, in speaking of
Fraser
,
has endeavored to adopt such a style as he conceived would
be least likely to give offence to the delicacy of a friend, who shuns
ostentation, and whose modesty is almost equal to his courage.
Major
Fraser is a native of the city of New-York.

CHAPTER XLVI.
SUCCESSFUL INVASION.
But the horrors of that fight,
Were the weeping muse to tell;
O'twould cleave the womb of night,
And awake the dead that fell.
Then the mighty pour'd their breath,
Slaughter feasted on the brave,
'Twas the carnival of Death!
'Twas the vintage of the grave.
Montgomery
.
The
approach of the American fleet had been
discovered by the watchful enemy, and at
day-light
the shore was lined with armed troops (
British
and Indians) to receive their invaders. The
wind was so high that the fleet could not assume
such a position as to cover the landing, and the
Americans had to approach the shore in boats,
exposed to a shower of musket-balls and leaden
slugs, which fell like hail around them, lashing
the lake into a frightful foam. The youthful hero
who had so long been the scourage of the
Canadian
border, the daring Forsyth, with his
well-tried
corps of riflemen, led the advance, in
batteaux
.
They pulled vigorously towards the
point proposed, but were forced by the wind
to a considerable distance above it. The enemy
were masked by a thick copse, within a few feet
of the water, and their fire was galling and
incessant
.
Forsyth, therefore, desired his men to rest
a moment on their oars, while his riflemen
returned
the shot.
Pike was at this moment standing on the ship's
deck, hurrying the infantry into the boats; when
observing the pause in the advance, he leaped
into his barge, accompanied by Fraser,
Willoughby
,
and the officers of his staff; and ordering
three companies to follow him instantly, under
major King,
[14]
[14]
King had previously distinguished himself in one of Smyth's
partial
invasions of the enemy's country, opposite Black-Rock, on the
Niagara river, on the twenty-eighth day of November, preceding,
where success and glory would have attended the American arms had
King been properly supported. As it was, with a little band of
followers
he stormed the enemy's principal battery, and after a
desperate
battle with three times their number, drove the enemy from the
field. In the mean time, colonel Boerstler, a very brave officer,
attacked
and dispersed the enemy, lower down the river, and every
battery between Chippewa and Fort Erie was soon carried, and the
cannon spiked or destroyed. Smyth would not permit the army to
cross, and King was captured.
was himself rowed into the thickest
of the fire, from which Willoughby received a
slight wound in the hand. Reuben was ordered
to remain on board, and stood watching the
departure
of his friend with the most painful
solicitude
.
Before Pike could reach the shore, Forsyth had
effected a landing, and was hotly engaged with
a host of British and Indians, (under the
immediate
command of general Sheaffe) who were
disputing
the possession of a high bank a short
distance
from the beach, which the Americans were
determined to ascend, in the face of a torrent of
death which was poured down upon them from
muskets and rifles. The remainder of the
Americans
now landed in rapid succession, and, as
soon as they were formed in order of battle, were
gallantly led to the charge by Pike himself. The
shock was not to be withstoodthe British
grenadiers
gave way, and retired in disorder, while
the Americans gained the summit of the bank, and
were soon masters of the field. The bugles of
Forsyth sounded the signal of victory, and the
Indians, sending forth a horrid yell of dismay,
fled in every direction. The British, however,
with their accustomed bravery and cool
intrepidity
,
again rallied, and presented a new front;
but, after an obstinate resistance, were
compelled
to retire within their fortifications.
These fortifications were to be taken by storm,
and for this purpose the column advanced towards
them with as much velocity as the streams and
ravines (which intersected the road) would
permit
.
After a slight resistance, the English
abandoned
their first battery, and retired to the
second
,
and soon after retreated to the citadel or
garrison.
Pike had ordered Fraser to proceed to the
right of the battery, in order to discover how
many
men were in the works. He had performed
this service, and now reported the number to his
general, and that they were spiking their guns.
Pike immediately ordered captain Walworth,
with his company of grenadiers, to make the
assault
,
when the enemy fled in the utmost confusion,
leaving several of their wounded comrades on the
ground.
The firing had now ceased on all sides, and the
victors were momentarily expecting a flag of
surrender
from the citadel, when its magazine was
blown into the air with an explosion so
stupendous
and awful, as appalled the stoutest heart!
The earth apparently shook to its centre, and the
air was darkened with the flying fragments of
earth, stone, and broken iron, descending in
dreadful ruin on the devoted heads of the
victorious
column.
Pike had just aided in removing a wounded
man to a safer position, and was at this moment
questioning a British sergeant, (who had been
captured) on the position and strength of the
enemy.
[15]
[15]
The conversation which on this occasion took
place between
general
Pike and the prisoner, is worthy of being recorded. I regret that
it is not in my
power to announce the name of so brave an
Englishman
to his countrymen.
This
prisoner was a British sergeant, had been slightly wounded in
the
shoulder by a rifle ball, and was sent by major Forsyth to the
general, who thus accosted him:
Pike
. Who
commands your troops?
Prisoner
. Sir Roger
Hall Sheaffe.
Pike
. Where is the main body
of your army?
Prisoner
.
Theretherethere(pointing in different
directions,
to evade a direct answer.)
Pike
. (
impatiently
) What is
your whole strength, and where are
the regulars?
Prisoner
. Sir, I am a British soldier! (placing his
right hand on
his breast, and intimating by his manner that he would
give no
information
.)
Pike
. You are a brave fellow(and was about to
proceed, when
the explosion took place, which proved fatal both to
the examiner and
examined.)
He was seated on a stump, with the
prisoner before him, Fraser on one side, and
captain
Nicholson (his volunteer aid) on the other,
when the explosion took place, and the group
were precipitated like lightning to the earth.
The English sergeant breathed no more, a large
stone having struck him on the head, and his
corpulent
body was so forcibly thrown upon Fraser,
that the latter lay crushed beneath him, severely
bruised, and for a time unable to move. Pike
and Nicholson were mortally wounded.
Sensible that he should survive but a short
time, Pike faintly exclaimed,
Push on my brave
fellows, and avenge your general!
The troops
replied with three cheers, and rushed like
bloodhounds
upon their prey. Pike and his wounded
aids were immediately removed from the field,
but had not proceeded far towards the shore,
when their ears were saluted by a tremendous
shout. Pike turned an inquiring look to one of
his supporters, who replied
The British
unionjack
is coming down, general; the stars are going
up!
He heaved a sigh of extacy, and smiled
amidst the anguish of his wounds. Shortly after
he had arrived on board the commodore's ship,
the trophy of his victory, the British flag, was
brought into his cabin, when he made a sign to
have it placed under his head, and expired without
a groanliterally reposing on the pillow of
victory
.
In the mean time, the command on shore
devolved
on colonel Pearce, who was pushing
rapidly
forward from the ruins of the citadel, (on
which the American banner was now flying)
towards
the town, when he was met by several
British
officers, with terms of capitulation. During
the discussion of these terms, (which was
purposely
prolonged by the proposers) general
Sheaffe was employed in destroying all the
military
stores, and the new ship on the stocks, which
was nearly ready for launchingremoved
whatever
could be easily transported, and then
effected
his escape with all his regulars, contrary to
the articles of capitulation, which considered them
and him prisoners of war. At four o'clock in the
afternoon the Americans were in possession of the
town, and reviewed by Dearborn, who had
landed
immediately after the unfortunate explosion.
It was now fully ascertained that the explosion
at the citadel was not the result of accident, as
many had at first imagined. It was a deep-laid
plan (contrived by an enemy who had shrunk
from an inferior force in the open field) to destroy
the army he had vainly though bravely opposed.
Had not Pike fortunately halted at the second
battery, the horrid contrivance would have
succeeded
to the extent of its projector's wishes; the
whole column must have been destroyed.
Five hundred barrels of powder, a vast number
of large stones, an immense quantity of iron shells
and shot, and a great variety of destructive
combustibles
,
were arranged for the purpose; the
train was skilfully laid, and the whole so
contrived
as to produce the most dreadful effect.
Two hundred and sixty Americans were either
killed or wounded by the explosion, among whom
were many officers of high rank and exalted
worth. About sixty of the enemy were also
involved
in the same terrible fate.
Fraser had been severely bruised in the
general
crash, and was probably preserved by the
corpulency
of the British sergeant, whose body was
thrown upon him, and became a shield to screen
him from the deluge of ruin which was poured
upon
the whole group. Such was the
instrumental
cause by which was preserved an existence so
useful to his countryso dear to patriotismso
precious to friendship.
Lieutenant Willoughby had not escaped, but
received a severe contusion in the breast, which
disabled him for the rest of the action, and he was
conveyed on board the fleet, when the sight of his
wound almost deprived the tender-hearted
Reuben
of all sensation. His affection, however,
enabled
him to subdue his terrors, and officiate as
nurse; his tender assiduities and unwearied
attention
were finally crowned with success, and he
again beheld in health the master he lovedthe
friend he almost adored.
CHAPTER XLVII.
FURTHER SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS.
To arms again our heroes fly,
And, leading on their lines,
Columbia's banner, in the sky,
The star of conquest shines.
Montgomery---altered
.
On
the first day of May, Dearborn's victorious
army evacuated York, and embarked on board
the fleet; and on the eighth, set sail for the
American
shore. Having another expedition in
contemplation
,
the vicinity of Fort Niagara, near the
head of the lake, was pitched upon as the most
eligible position for making the necessary
arrangements
;
to that place the squadron, therefore,
proceeded
,
where the troops were landed, when part
of the fleet was ordered to Sacket's Harbor for
reinforcements. The intrepid Scott, who was
made a prisoner at Queenston, had been lately
exchanged
,
and now joined Dearborn, in capacity
of adjutant-general to the northern army.
Having procured the necessary reinforcements,
which increased his army to near five thousand
men, Dearborn determined on attempting the
reduction of the peninsula on the opposite side of
the straits, where was situated a strong fortress
called Fort George. The necessary arrangements
were all completed on the twenty-sixth of May,
and on the following night, at one o'clock, the
whole army embarked, on Lake Ontario, about
three miles east of Fort Niagara. It was
arranged
in six divisions of boats; the first of which
contained the advance guard, under colonel Scott,
who was specially selected for this command.

This was followed by colonel Porter, with the
field train, the brigades of Boyd, Winder, and
Chandler, and a reserve under colonel M`Comb.
On the preceding day Chauncey had
reconnoitred
the position for landing the troops; he
sounded the shore in the night, and placed buoys
to mark the stations of the small vessels.
Captain
Perry (who, for some months, had been
employed
at Erie, in superintending the building
and equipping vessels for the service of that
lake, to the command of which he had been
appointed
)
arrived in the vicinity of Fort Niagara,
to procure seamen for his squadron, just as the
army were about to embark on their present
expedition
.
He immediately volunteered his
services
,
which were promptly accepted by
Dearborn
and Chauncey, who cheerfully confided to
his management the conducting of the divisions,
which was an operation of some difficulty, in
consequence
of the winds and a strong current,
together
with the tremendous fire of the enemy. In
the discharge of this duty, Perry was present at
every point where he could be useful, under
showers of musketry, and rendered very
essential
services to the advance guard, which he
accompanied
nearly to its point of attack. The
squadron took a position to open their fire upon
the British batteries, while a heavy discharge from
Fort Niagara was also directed against them. In
ten minutes they were nearly all silenced, and
soon after abandoned by the enemy.
Scott effected his landing in good order, near
one of the silenced forts, under a severe and
galling
fire of musketry, which was poured upon him
from a high bank like a parapet, on which the
English stood to receive their invaders. Scott
formed his line on the beach, and then gallantly
scaled the bank (fifteen feet in height) against a
row of fifteen hundred bayonets which fringed its
summit. The assault was brisk and vigorous,
but twice repeated without success. At this
moment
,
Boyd landed with his brigade, and the
united troops advanced with such determined
bravery, that the enemy gave way, and the bank
was occupied by the Americans. Boyd was the
senior officer on shore, and as such commanded
both brigades. He was the first man who
reached
the top of the bank, where he proclaimed his
success by three cheers. In a few minutes,
however
,
the British rallied, and returned to the
charge, when a most desperate and destructive
conflict ensued, which continued for about fifteen
minutes, and terminated in the total rout of the
enemy at every point, who, during their retreat,
were exposed to a tremendous shower of grape
and canister from the squadron. Above one
hundred
of them bit the dust on the summit of the bank.
The retreating foe was closely pursued for
above five miles up the river, and the greater part
of them would have probably been made
prisoners
,
had not the light troops under colonel Scott
and colonel Miller, been injudiciously called in
from the pursuit, and for the second time,
permitted
a beaten enemy to escape from their
conquerors
.
As the Americans advanced towards Fort
George, (the bulwark of the peninsula) it was
perceived that the garrison were in the act of
abandoning it, the shot from Fort Niagara being
so accurately thrown as to render it untenable.
Two companies were immediately ordered
forward
to prevent this movement, who succeeded
in making several prisoners, but the rest escaped.
When within eighty paces of the abandoned fort,
one of its magazines was blown up with a
tremendous
explosion. The front gate was instantly
forced, and Scott was the first to enter, and with
his own hands struck the British flag which was
yet waving on the works. Trains had been laid
by the retreating garrison to three other
magazines
,
and the matches were almost burnt to the
fatal mark, when the Americans entered the fort.
Lieutenant Willoughby (who entered the gate
with captains Hindman and Stockton,
immediately
behind Scott) sprang forward and snatched one
of the matches from the train, while the other two
were with equal alacrity secured by Hindman and
Stockton; thus by the coolness and presence of
mind of these gallant officers, the lives of many
hundreds were saved, and a formidable fortress
preserved from destruction.
The British loss of regular soldiers, in killed,
wounded, and prisoners, was three hundred and
eighty-six, and five hundred militia prisoners,
who were paroled, making their total loss amount
to
eight hundred and eighty-six
. Colonel Myers,
who commanded them, was wounded and taken
prisoner. The American loss in killed and
wounded was one hundred and fifty.
Among the champions of freedom who
particularly
distinguished themselves on this occasion,
posterity will meet the names of Boyd, Scott,
Winder
,
Lewis, M`Clure, M`Comb, Chandler, Fraser,
(now Chandler's aid) Willoughby, Porter,
Armistead
,
Forsyth, Riddle, Hindman, Totten,Stockton,
King, Arrowsmith, Steel, Roach, and Swearingen,
of whom the five last were wounded. Among the
heroes attached to the squadron, it is but just to
mention, after their gallant commander,
lieutenants
Macpherson, Brown, Pettigrew, Smith,
Osgood
,
Trant, Mix, and Stevens. Chauncey was
indefatigable in his co-operations with the army,
in all its important movements, and much of that
day's success and glory is attributable to his
judicious
plans and unremitting exertions in their
execution.
On the day after the battle, Perry departed for
Lake Erie, taking with him fifty seamen for his
little squadron on those waters. Two brigs had
been launched at Erie, and two or three small
schooners had been purchased for the service.
His present object was to take his fifty seamen to
Black Rock, to take five vessels from the river
Niagara into the lake. Previous to his
departure
,
however, he had an interview with our hero,
when a reciprocal relation of adventures took
place, to the mutual satisfaction of both the young
heroes.
Perry had, it seems, become weary of
commanding
gun-boats; for his enterprising and
active
mind required a less contracted theatre for
the exercise of his aspiring talents. Every
situation
will become irksome to a brave man which
affords no opportunity of being useful to his
country
,
or of acquiring honor to himself. Perry,
therefore, applied to the navy department for an
appointment on the Lakes, and the application
was successful.
[16]
[16]
See Analetic Magazine and Port Folio.
So attached to him were the
brave tars of his gun-boat squadron, that they
cheerfully volunteered to follow his new fortunes,
and accompany him to the lakes.
In a few days he was ready to depart, and
tearing
himself from the comforts of home, and the
36*
endearments of a young and beautiful wife and
blooming child, he set off with his generous and
hardy followers, on his expedition to the
wilderness
.
The rivers being completely frozen over,
they were obliged to perform the journey by land,
in the depth of winter. The greatest order and
good humor, however, prevailed throughout the
little
band of adventurers, to whom the whole
expedition
seemed a kind of frolic, and who were
delighted with what they termed a land cruise.
He proceeded, with his men, to Sacket's
Harbor
,
and reported himself to Chauncey, who
immediately
detached him to Lake Erie, to take the
command of the squadron on that station, and to
superintend the building of additional vessels.
The British, at this time, held the entire and
exclusive
possession of this lake, and to Perry was
confided the important duty of creating a fleet, in
the face of a proud and insolent foe. He had not
only to contemplate the day as extremely dubious
and distant when he should meet his enemy on
fair and honorable terms on the bosom of the lake,
but likewise to guard against surprise, and run the
risk of having his navy destroyed on the stocks.
But to a mind like his, obstacles only added
ardor
and excited perseverancehe was
determined
to succeed. Perry and Willoughby parted
with mutual regret, both sincerely wishing that
they had been destined to serve their country on
the same element.
On the day following the capture of Fort
George, Dearborn received information that the
retreating enemy had made a stand at a place
called Beaver Dams, about eight miles from
Queenston; he therefore immediately ordered
general Lewis to march to that place with
Chandler's
and Winder's brigades, the light artillery,
dragoons and riflemen, to cut off their retreat.
The English, however, although considerably
reinforced
,
would not risk another battle, but broke
up their encampment on the approach of the
Americans, and fled with precipitation along the
mountains, towards Lake Ontario. Lewis moved
on, and took possession of every British post
between
Fort George and Fort Erie, the latter of
which had been abandoned by the panic-struck
enemy, and was now occupied by
lieutenant-colonel
Preston. Thus the whole peninsula between
the two lakes was brought under the controul of
the Americans, and the navigation of Niagara
river
secured to their vessels. An important
preliminary
step to the operations of Perry.
Finding no enemy to contend with, Lewis
returned
to Fort George; but intelligence had
reached Dearborn that Proctor's army was on a
rapid march from the Northwest to join that of
Vincent, and retrieve the misfortunes of the
British
arms; he therefore ordered Winder and
Chandler to proceed with their brigades towards
Burlington Bay, (the most western point of Lake
Ontario) in order to prevent a junction of the
British
generals. Vincent had already made a stand
on Burlington Heights, about fifty miles from Fort
George, when these two brigades encamped in
his vicinity. The chief command of the
Americans
on this expedition had been assigned to
Chandler, and the whole encamped, on the
evening
of the fifth of June, at a place called Stony
Creek.
A little after midnight, captain Van Vechten,
who commanded the advance guard, was alarmed
by several deep groans near him, as of a person
in the agonies of death, but before he had time to
form a conjecture on the subject, his guard was
surrounded by the British, and the whole with
himself made prisoners. The enemy had
approached
in the most profound silence,
effectually
screened by the darkness of the night; had
despatched
the sentinels with their bayonets, and
now seizing five pieces of light artillery,
instantly
turned them upon the encampment, before any
alarm could be given, and poured their contents
in among the sleeping troops.
A scene of dreadful confusion ensued, the
halfwaked
Americans not being able to distinguish
friends from foes, but desperately assailed each
other in the dark. Not being aware that the
artillery
in front was in the hands of the British,
Chandler and Winder flew to the battery to
change the direction of its fire, and were both
made prisoners. Of this event the other officers
were ignorant, and every one chose his own plan
of resisting the assailants, not knowing where to
look for orders.
Towson's artillery was stationed more in the
rear, and he now opened its fire on the enemy with
such effect that the confusion and dismay was
suddenly transferred from the American to the
British ranks. This gallant officer was soon
supported
by spirits born to conquer; Hindman,
Nicholas
,
Burn, Milton, Steele, Willoughby,
Chrystie
,
Eldridge, Fraser, Biddle, Archer, M`Chesney,
M`Donough, Armstrong, Riddle, and others as
brave, carried death in every direction. Their
fire was irresistible. The enemy were dispersed
at all points, but again returned to the contest.
Several desperate attempts were made to
retake
the artillery, but without success; till, at
length, lieutenant M`Chesney (with a gallantry
that will immortalize his name) dashed into the
thickest of the enemy, hewed a bloody path to
the nearest piece, and succeeded in restoring it
to the original possessors. His bravery also
saved several other pieces from falling into the
enemy's power.
The dawn of day now enabled the troops to
distinguish each other, when colonel Burn took
command of the Americans, and proceeded to
form the yet disordered line, the conflict still
continuing
with the most desperate fury on both sides.
Never rose the astonished sun
On so obstinate a fight.
The American dragoons at length made a
tremendous
and effectual assaultthe enemy could not
withstand the impetuosity of the charge, but broke
and fled in every direction. Their commanding
officer was missing some time before, and was not
found by his troops until the following day, when
he was discovered about four miles from the scene
of action, destitute of a hat, without a horse, and
almost famished. During the retreat of the
British
,
lieutenant M`Donough very gallantly
recovered
another field-piece, which they were
attempting
to carry off with them.
The total loss of the Americans in this affair,
(which was trifling in comparison with that of the
British) was one hundred and fifty-four, including
killed, wounded, and missing, while the British
missing
alone must have been nearly equal to that
number, as above a hundred of them were sent
as prisoners to Fort George. Fraser (who acted
as aid to Chandler) was slightly wounded, and
narrowly escaped sharing the captivity of his
general.
On the second day after the battle, as the army
were encamped on the borders of the lake, about
ten miles from the scene of action, (where they had
been joined by Boyd and Lewis, the latter
having
the command) they were summoned to
surrender
by Sir James Yeo, the commander of the
British squadron, which had arrived in the night,
and was now stationed abreast of the encampment,
within a mile of the shore. No notice was taken
of this insolent demand, and as Dearborn had sent
an express to recall the troops to Fort George,
Lewis prepared to retire in obedience to this
order
,
and the army returned accordingly.
While these transactions were passing in the
enemy's territory, an event of some importance
occurred on the American shore of Ontario. The
defenceless state in which Sacket's Harbor was
necessarily left, (by employing the army and the
squadron in the foregoing expedition) induced
the British to attempt its reduction, and thereby
secure to themselves the mastery of the Lake.
Dearborn was apprised of this intention, and
therefore wrote to general Brown, requesting him
to repair immediately to that important post, with
as much militia force as he could collect, and
assume
the command there.
[17]
[17]
See Analetic Magazine, vol. v, p. 294.
Brown, knowing that
colonel Backus, a regular officer of character and
experience, was then in command at that place, at
first hesitated. But the request being again
repeated
,
and urged by Backus himself, he finally
yielded, and immediately set out for that post,
where he arrived with a small body of militia
early
on the morning of Friday the twenty-eighth
day of May. At day-break, the next morning,
Sir George Provost landed at the head of one
thousand picked men, under cover of a heavy fire
from his gun-boats. Brown, depending chiefly
upon the well known superiority of the American
musketry, had posted five hundred of his militia
to receive the enemy on their landing, with
orders
that they should lie close, and reserve their
fire until the enemy had approached so nigh that
every shot might hit its object. But the
trepidation
and confusion of the moment excited one of
those sudden panics to which undisciplined
volunteers
are so subject, and the whole line fired
at the very instant of the enemy's landing, and
then fled in disorder. Brown threw himself
among them to stop their flight, and having
rallied
about a hundred men, he gained a position
on the enemy's left flank, and harassed them by
a galling fire, by which they were held in check,
until they were met by the regular troops under
colonel Backus. Brown now hurried to this
point of action, and found the gallant Backus
dangerously
wounded, and the battle still raging, but
with very evident advantage on the American
side. After a short conflict he was completely
victorious, and Prevost retreated rapidly to his
ships, leaving a number of men and several
officers
killed and wounded on the field.
On the first of June Chauncey returned to
Sacket's Harbor with the squadron, and Brown
once more retired to his farm and ordinary
occupation
.
But his military reputation was now
established, and public expectation was anxiously
turned towards him as one to whom the fortunes
and honor of the American arms might be
confidently
entrusted; all wishing that his rank was in
the regular army instead of the militia.
CHAPTER XLVIII.
THE JOURNAL.
An honest tale speeds best, being plainly told.
Shakspeare
.
During
the foregoing operations, Dearborn
was very severely indisposed, being a great part
of the time confined to his bed, from whence he
issued his orders. His indisposition had now
increased
to such an alarming degree, that he found
himself totally unfit for active duty, and therefore
resigned his command, and sought that peaceful
retirement which was more fitted to his advanced
years and war-worn constitution. General
Lewis
had repaired to Sacket's Harbor, to act in
concert
with Chauncey, and the command of the
American army in Canada therefore devolved on
the hero to whose military skill and personal
gallantry
the possession of the British Peninsula was
principally owing. I mean the gallant Boyd,
whose exalted worth and pre-eminent services
have not (from some unaccountable fatality)
received
the reward they so richly merit.
Partiality
or prejudice have precipitately placed unfading
chaplets on less-deserving brows; but the steady
and unerring hand of Truth shall yet inscribe the
name of Boyd on the brightest column in the
temple
of Fame. Blind to his superior merits,
notwithstanding
their recent brilliant display, the
secretary
of war affected to consider him merely as
a substitute for a more able commander; and at
once placed a veto on any future exhibition of
his talents, by forbidding him to engage the
enemy
,
if possible to avoid it.
[18]
[18]
The following is the copy of a letter from the
Secretary of War
to general Boydfrom which the above
inference can be fairly
drawn:
War Department
,
July
7,
1813.
Sir
General Dearborn being
about to withdraw from the
command
of the army, until his health shall be re-established, this trust
will
devolve upon you, as the senior officer,
until
the arrival of
some
person to whom it will
be
specially assigned. During
this
period
,
you will pay the utmost attention to the
instruction and discipline of
the troops, and engage in
no
affair with the enemy, that can be
avoided
.
The orders of Generals Hampton and Lewis, you will obey.
I am, sir, with
great respect, your most obedient servant,
JOHN
ARMSTRONG.
Brig. Gen. Jno. P. Boyd, Fort
George
.
Many other disadvantages attended his
command
;
Dearborn and Lewis had never seen fit to
consult a subaltern, and Boyd was, consequently,
destitute of any information relative to the
campaign
.
Still, however, he was determined to
discharge
his
duty, as far as his superiors would
condescend
to entrust him with a knowledge of it,
and leave the result to Providence. While he
could be useful to his country, he was resolved
that no
personal
motives should induce him to
abandon her cause.
The American force in Canada was now daily
diminishing by sickness, and
surprises
, while that
of the enemy was rapidly increasing by
reinforcements
of regulars, militia, and Indians. Five
hundred
American infantry and twenty light
dragoons
,
under the command of colonel Boerstler, together with forty-four mounted riflemen, under
major Chapin, had been
surprised
on their march
from Fort George to Beaver Dams, by a combined
force of British and Indians, who lay concealed in
the woods near the road they were passing. The
contest was maintained with great bravery for
some time, but terminated in the surrender of the
37
Americans. As a division of the prisoners were
conducted towards Kingston by water, the daring
Chapin resolved on effecting his escape, which he
did, (with twenty-eight men, and two boats) by
disarming the guard, consisting of sixteen men,
and making them prisoners. They arrived at
Fort Niagara in safety on the thirteenth of July.
Many of the officers at Fort George were so
severely indisposed as to be unfit for duty, and
disease was making serious havoc in the ranks.
Lieutenant Willoughby had been for several days
under the doctor's care, and nursed by the
attentive
and faithful Reuben, but was now so far
recovered
as to be able to write, and accordingly
devoted the eleventh of July to that employment
bringing up his journal to that date. In
recording
the events of that horrible night in which the
camp of Chandler had been
surprised
, he gave a
loose to his poetic fancy, and inserted the
following
song, which I have thought proper to copy:
THE BUGLE.
Deep murmuring down the lonely dell,
The dull tattoo, with drowsy swell,
Had bid the march-worn soldier rest,
With armor buckled on his breast.
But, hark! what cry alarms?
The foe at hand!to arms!
And, darting from the ground,
The slumbering veterans bound,
While the Bugle sounds the CHARGE, rousing echo with
the sound.
And now the cannon's sullen roar
Deep rolls along Ontario's shore,
While Freedom's sons surprised remain,
Their watch-word stoletheir pickets slain.
In vain the trump alarms,
In vain the cry, to arms!
The foe from ambush springs,
Their yell the welkin rings,
While the Bugle sounds RETREAT, adding speed to
terror's
wings.
Shall Freedom's veterans fly the field,
Her heroes shrinkher chieftains yield?
Say, where's the spirit of the brave
Who bled, Columbia's rights to save?
It lives! it breathes! it warms!
Roused by the clash of arms,
Vengeance, with eye of flame,
Fires with a love of fame,
While the Bugle sounds the RALLY, until victory we
claim.
Having completed his task, and still having
time and inclination to continue the employment,
he sincerely regretted that the lengthened silence
of his correspondents had left many chasms to
fill up in his journal; but while he was
expressing
this regret to Reuben, a sergeant entered and
handed him a packet of letters which had just
been received at the encampment (among many
others) by a vessel which had arrived with
hospital
stores; these letters contained the very
particulars
he desired. One of them was from his
father, another from Morse, two others from his
correspondents at Washington, a fifth from
Norfolk
,
and a sixth from New-York.
Although I have permission, I do not deem it
necessary to lay all or any of these letters before
my readers. The following is a brief synopsis
of their contents, as
journalized
by our hero
himself
.
March
4, 1813. James Madison, who has
been elected President of the United States for
a second term of four years, was this day
installed
according to law, at the capitol, in the city of
Washington, in presence of both houses of
Congress
,
and a vast concourse of spectators.
Congress
adjourned, to meet again on the
twenty-fourth
day of May.
March
8. The emperor of Russia, through
his ministers, has offered to the United States and
Great Britain, his mediation, with a view to
promote
peace between the two countries. A
communication
to this effect has been received by the
American government, and the proposition
cordially
acceded to. Ambassadors are to be
immediately
appointed to proceed to Europe for
the purpose of commencing the negociation with
others appointed by Great Britain.
March
11. The privateer general Armstrong,
captain Champlin, had a long and sanguinary
engagement
with a British frigate, and finally
effected
her escape, after being much cut up in sails
and rigging, and having seven killed and sixteen
wounded. A great many Englishmen were
killed
,
and thrown overboard in sight of the
Americans
.
March
20. Commodore Beresford, of the
British
blockading squadron in the river Delaware,
made an insolent demand on the chief magistrate
of Lewis, a small town on the river bank, for
twenty
live bullocks, with a proportionate quantity of
vegetables and hay, for the use of his Britannic
majesty's squadron. This demand was
promptly
and spiritedly refused, notwithstanding the
commodore's
threat of destroying the town in case of
a refusal.
April
6. Beresford commenced an attack on
Lewis, and then renewed his demand, expressing
his grief for the fate of the women and children in
case he should be compelled to destroy the town.
The reply was very laconicColonel Davis is
a gallant man, and has already taken care of the
ladies. The attack was immediately renewed,
and continued for twenty hours, during which
time upwards of six hundred shot, shells, and
Congreve
rockets, were discharged from the
squadron
.
The shells did not reach the town, the
rockets passed over it, and the shot did but
little
damage; and so the affair ended.
April
26. Fort Meigs was on this day closely
invested by an immense force of British and
Indians
.
Harrison had been expecting this event,
and had used every exertion to put the fort in the
best possible state of defence. On the
appearance
of the enemy he dispatched an express to
general Clay, of Kentucky, who arrived with his
brigade on the ninth day of May to relieve the
garrison; when a desperate battle took place, in
which colonel Dudley's detachment drove all
before
them; until, led on by an impetuous ardor
in pursuing the retreating foe, they were drawn
into the woods, where an ambuscade surprised
and destroyed nearly the whole detachment. The
remainder of the brigade, seconded by a sortie
from the fort, carried the enemy's works, spiked
his cannon, and compelled him to raise the siege,
which had continued thirteen days. During this
period, eighteen hundred shells and cannon balls
had been thrown into the fort, and a continual
discharge of small arms had been kept up; yet
the American loss was only eighty-one killed, and
one hundred and eighty-nine wounded, a great
proportion of which occurred in the sortie of the
last day. Dudley's body was found shockingly
37*
mangled by the savages. Among the Americans
who signalized themselves on this occasion, were
colonel Miller, majors Ball, Alexander, Todd,
Sodwick, Ritzer, and Johnson; captains Wood,
Croghan, Hamilton, Langhan, Bradford, and
Nearing; lieutenants Gwynne and Campbell.
May
3. Havre-de-Grace, a small town on the
Susquehannah river, near its junction with the
waters of the Chesapeake, was bombarded by
the British, the houses burnt, and the inhabitants
plundered. On this occasion, an old citizen,
named O'Neill, signalized himself by his courage
and perseverance. He was at length taken
prisoner
,
and detained several days, but finally given up
on demand of the magistrates of that place. This
burning and robbing excursion was conducted by
admiral Cockburn in person, who permitted his
followers to commit the most wanton excesses
without restraint. Horses were killed, carriages
demolished, furniture destroyed, church-windows
broken, and every dwelling house burnt except
one, to which all the terrified women and children
had fled for shelter. Thus these peaceful and
defenceless villagers were left without houses,
property, or clothesthe men abusedthe
females
insultedevery one plundered! How
different
the Americans! Were there a wretch in
the army which now occupies the British
Peninsula
in Canada, base enough to plunder the
defenceless
inhabitants, he would expiate the
offence
with his life.
May
16. The ship Neptune sailed from
New-Castle
,
having on board the embassy to Russia,
and their suite. They carry with them the news
of the capture of York, which, it is apprehended,
will be as efficient in the negociation as any
thing they can take out.
May
24. The frigate United States,
commodore
Decatur; frigate Macedonian, captain
Jones; and sloop of war Hornet, captain Biddle,
proceeded from the harbor of New-York into the
Sound, with the intention of going to sea, but were
chased by a British squadron into New-London,
and blockaded there.
June
1. The Chesapeake frigate was
captured
by the British frigate Shannon, after a
sanguinary
conflict, in which every officer on the
upper
deck of the Chesapeake was either killed or
wounded. Lawrence, who had already
immortalized
himself in capturing the Peacock, had been
appointed (very much against his wishes) to
command
the Chesapeake. While lying in the
lower
harbor of Boston, nearly ready for sea, the
Shannon appeared off the harbor, and made
signals
expressive of a challenge. The brave
Lawrence
was not to be vainly defied, but
immediately
determined to proceed to sea and give battle
to the haughty challenger, although he was
conscious
of the great disparity between the two
ships.
On seeing him come out, the Shannon bore
away, and the Chesapeake followed. The
action
commenced within pistol shot, and the firing
on both sides was tremendousthat of the
Shannon peculiarly fatal; not only making great
slaughter among the Chesapeake's men, but
cutting
down some of the most valuable officers, and
wounding the commander. Three men were
successively
shot from the helm, each taking the
wheel as the other fell, and this circumstance so
affected the steering of the ship, that she fell foul
of the Shannon, and became grappled by the fluke
of her anchor. In this situation, while the
Americans
were swept from their stations by a
terrible
raking fire, the enemy succeeded in
boarding
.
Lawrence had received a mortal wound,
and was borne bleeding from the deck,
exclaiming
to his officers
dont give up the ship!
But
the enemy had gained possession of the
quarter-deck
,
and were soon masters of the frigate.
Lawrence expired on the fifth day after the
battle, and was buried in Halifax with the honors
of war, as was, also, his first lieutenant,
Augustus
C. Ludlow, a young gentleman who had
rendered
himself admired for his bravery and
beloved
for his virtues. The American loss was forty
killed and more than one hundred wounded. The
British loss was perhaps not so great.
June
20. The Creek Indians have
commenced
hostilities against the United States, by
making
war upon those Indians who are friendly to the
American cause.
June
25. The town of Hampton, in Virginia,
about eighteen miles from Norfolk, was burnt and
plundered by Cockburn's banditti, and the
conflagration
was followed by several instances of
rape
and murder, committed by the profligate
soldiery!
July
8. Two of the out-posts of the American
encampment at Fort George, were this day
attacked
by the combined force of British and
Indians
.
Adjutant lieutenant Eldridge, was
ordered
to proceed to the scene of action with a small
detachment of thirty-nine men, and support his
countrymen until a more formidable body could
arrive, which was to follow him, under major
Malcolm. In the ardor of contest, the gallant
Eldridge was drawn into an ambuscade, and his
brave little band, after a desperate fight,
compelled
to surrender, when they were all immediately
massacred and scalped; their sculls were cloven
in twain, their bosoms rent open, and their
quivering
hearts torn out, by these merciless
savages
.
Eldridge shared the same fate, and only
five of the party escaped. A more gallant
soldier
than lieutenant Eldridge, the army could not
boast.

Anon.
Among
several officers who had lately become
attached to the American army in Canada, was
captain
Sandford
. At the commencement of
the war he was stationed on the Niagara frontier,
and was at Black Rock when the gallant Elliott
surprised and captured the Detroit and
Caledonia
,
by which event young Willoughby was
restored
to liberty. Our hero's sudden departure for
Lewiston, however, at that time, prevented an
interview
with Sandford, who soon after obtained a
furlough to visit Boston and take possession of a
considerable fortune to which he had become heir
by the recent death of his mother. By various
plausible excuses he had contrived to extend this
furlough to above nine months, which he had
passed
in the most profligate extravagance and
dissipation
;
till having expended all his ready cash,
and drawn largely on the credit of his real estate,
he began to dread the clamor of his creditors
more than the thunder of the enemy's artillery,
and therefore took a
hasty
leave of Boston, and
proceeded to join the army.
Willoughby and Sandford first recognised each
other on parade, and the embarrassment of the
latter was so visible that it did not escape the
notice
of several officers, who were, of course,
ignorant
of the cause. George informed him by a
look that he knew him; Sandford had
heard
of
his couragehe had
felt
his prowesshe knew
that he had injured him, or at least attempted it.
His reflections, during the day, were far from
being
enviable; and in the evening, when he
received
a letter from the hand of Reuben, who
informed
him that it was from lieutenant
Willoughby
,
he had scarcely resolution to break the seal.
What effect its contents produced on his mind will
appear hereafter. He read as follows:
Friday Evening, July
16, 1813.
To Captain Thomas Sandford
.
Sir
Pity alone has prompted me to take
this method of relieving an embarrassment which
must not only be very painful to your feelings,
but which (judging from what I this day
witnessed
)
will so impede the performance of your
professional
duties, as to endanger your reputation.
But, sir, you may discard all
apprehensions
from
your mindI shall
never
molest you. You know
the word of George Washington Willoughby is
sacredit was never yet violated
I shall not
condescend to chastise a being whose meanness has
sunk him so far below my resentment
. I know
what you might reasonably expect from many of
our young officers, were they placed in my
situation
.
But it is well known to you that my notions
of honor are altogether different. You have
never
injured me, because
it was not in your power
.
But even if your despicable attempts had
succeeded
had
you robbed me of my greatest
earthly treasure, your blood would no more tend
to wash away the injury, than that which daily
flows in the meanest butcher's shambles.
Entertain
no fears, then, for your life; I shall
never
seek to deprive you of a gem so tarnished with
corruption, and yet, so dear to its possessor.
But, sir, though I harbor no resentment
against you, and shall meet you on duty with
perfect
indifference, yet, do not seek my society; for
our dispositions are so diametrically opposite,
that no happiness can result from intercourse.
No intimacy, therefore, must ever exist between
us, until I have evident and incontrovertible
proofs of a thorough reformation in your morals,
and a radical change in your life and disposition.
Then (but not till then) will I take you cordially
by the hand, and ask no apology for the past.
G. W. WILLOUGHBY.
The first sensation which Sandford experienced
on reading the foregoing letter, was pleasure for
the dissipation of his personal fears; the next was
rage at its cavilier and contemptuous style; the
last was determined hatred and revenge. He
well knew our hero's deep-rooted abhorrence of
that species of cool-blooded murder called
duelling
they had debated the subject largeIy at
college, where George had often declared that he
would never hesitate a moment in the choice
to be
engaged in a duel
, or to be
posted for a
coward
.
It was always his maxim, that in choosing
between a
sin
and a
shame
, the latter was a lesser
evil of the two. Sandford remembered all this,
and was now convinced that George had not
changed his opinion. He therefore resolved to
establish his own reputation for courage, by
challenging
lieutenant Willoughby to single combat;
and satisfy his revenge, by proclaiming him a
coward.
It may be recollected, that when Sandford
entered
the church at Cleveland, as recorded in the
twenty-fifth chapter of this history,
[19]
[19]
See volume i, page 206.
he was
accompanied
by another officer with whom the
reader was not then made acquainted. This man
(whose name was Smith) was Sandford's most
particular friend, had always been his companion
in profligacy, his partner at the gaming table, and
his associate in debauchery. In one respect,
however, he was greatly Sandford's superior
he possessed courage, and had repeatedly
distinguished
himself in the field of battle. But,
with the exception of Sandford, there was scarcely
an officer in the army whom Smith could call his
friend; he was considered a
bully
, and his
society
was rather avoided than courted.
Our hero had a slight acquaintance with Smith,
but had shown no disposition to increase it; he
was, consequently, not a little surprised at
receiving
an early visit from that officer, on the morning
following his communication to Sandford. Smith
haughtily announced the nature of his embassy,
and delivered a note from Sandford, demanding
of lieutenant Willoughby immediate satisfaction
for the unwarrantable insults contained in his
letter
of last evening.
Our hero read the note with a smile, then coolly
returned it to the bearer, with this verbal
message
Tell
captain Sandford, that if he wishes
to try the strength of his nerves, the enemy will
probably soon afford him an opportunity. I have
sufficient confidence in my own, already.
Smith
. This is
no answer
, sir.
George
. This is
my answer
, sir.
Smith
. And you refuse to give captain
Sandford
the satisfaction due to a gentleman?
George
. I refuse to give captain Sandford an
opportunity of making himself appear ridiculous,
which I know would be the case did I accede to
his mad proposal. He would sooner beg my
pardon
,
sir, on parade, than meet me as an enemy.
Such a humiliation he richly merits, but I will not
violate my duty even to inflict that.
Smith
. Where your ungenerous insinuations
against the honor of my friend, founded on fact,
sir, would he have thus invited a meeting? Let
me request you, sir, to be consistent. This note
was written by captain Sandford.
George
. And captain Sandford, sir, would
sooner have eaten his fingers than written that
note to me, did he not hold my written pledge that
I would take no step hostile to his personal safety.
It is upon that pledge alone that he thus presumes.
Smith
. I am not authorised, sir, to receive any
explanations, nor do I ask any. I wish to return
my friend a definitive answer. Will you, or will
you not, meet captain Sandford?
38
George
. Never, as an
enemy
never as a
friend
,
until he reforms his morals.
Smith
. Then, sir, I am authorised to inform
you that my friend Sandford will find himself
reduced
to the necessity, not only of proclaiming
you to the army and the world for a cowardly
paltroon, but of treating you as such whenever he
meets you.
George
. Your friend Sandford, sir, loves
himself
too well to put his threat in execution; and I
hope his friends will not so jeopardize their
reputation
as to become his agents.
Smith
. What, sir, if I do?
George
. You will proclaim yourself a liar,
and forfeit the confidence of all honest men.
Smith
. This language is very singular, sir,
and such as I did not expect from an officer of
your standing and reputation. You cannot,
surely
,
be ignorant of the customary course to be
pursued
in such cases? Captain Sandford feels
himself
injured by you, and demands redressan
honorable reparation. What can be more
reasonable
than such a demand on his part, or more
just than a compliance on yours?
George
. I never injured any man. If any man
thinks, or like your friend Sandford, affects to
think that I have wronged him, let him invite a
meeting of accommodation in presence of a
certain
number of gentlemen whom he himself may
choose, and whatever be their decision, on
hearing
both sides of the question, I will willingly
abide by. Ask your friend to submit his cause to
such a test, and he will blushif he be yet
susceptible
of shame. He dare not thus expose the
meanness and duplicity of his past conducthe
dare not exhibit the letter on which his present
insolence is predicatedhe would almost as soon
fight. Tell him, however, that I retain a copy of it.
Smith
. Although I act as the friend of captain
Sandford in this affair, I know nothing of the
merits of the case. He seeks the meeting, and
has commissioned me to see that it be conducted
on fair and honorable principles. It is not my
business
to inquire whether his injuries are real or
imaginary. The pledge you mention
George
. (
Rising with dignity
) Does not extend
to his friends, sir; and I wish no further
communion
with a man who can so far forget the dignity
of his nature as to espouse a cause in any
controversy
,
while he confesses he is ignorant of its
merits. You have heard my answer to your
principal
my
time is too valuable to be thus
dissipated
.
Good morning, sir.
Smith
. You will hear again from
me
, sir.
George
. It will give me no pleasure, sir,
unless
I hear that you have adopted sentiments more
congenial with virtue and genuine honor. Once
more, good morning.
Sandford had been awaiting his friend's return
in the most anxious suspense. More than once
he wished to recal the note of defiance he had
written, lest it should be accepted, and he be
compelled to fight, or become an object of
contempt
and ridicule. The solemn promise of
Willoughby, however, added to his established
and undisguished principles, had set his mind at
rest on that score, and he was contemplating the
triumph which awaited him, when Smith entered
his quarters, and related
verbatim
his
conversation
with Willoughby.
Sandford
did
blush, and bite his lips, too, till
they bled, during the recital. He began to feel
that he did indeed love himself too well to
proclaim lieutenant Willoughby a coward to an
army that almost adored him for his generous
gallantry
to
officers who (of every grade) were
ambitious of his society and conversation, and
zealous in emulating his courage, manners, and
fascinating accomplishments. Sandford was well
aware that Willoughby had numerous friends in
the camp who were brave as himself, and not
bound by those correct principles of reason and
religion, by which George was governed; he
therefore reasonably concluded, that to announce
himself as the enemy of lieutenant Willoughby,
would be to expose himself to the indignation of
too many rash spirits. He finally determined to
let the matter drop, content with having proved
his spirit, in the eyes of Smith at least, whom he
requested to pursue the affair no further, nor
expose
either of them to an arrest for having
violated
an order of the war department, forbidding the
sending or bearing a challenge.
But with respect to Smith's opinion of his
courage, Sandford was mistaken. The hints of
Willoughby, and the present conduct of
Sandford
,
created suspicions in the mind of Smith not
very honorable to his friend; he therefore
replied
with this observation:
Then I am to understand, sir, that you are
satisfied?
Sandford
. Yesno, sirnot satisfied; but if
the scoundrel refuses to meet me, what step can
be taken?
Smith
. Cane him, kick him, pull his nose.
Sandford
. Why, to be surebut would not
that be descending to the level of a blackguard?
I think, sir, we had better let it drop, at least for
the present. I shall find some opportunity of
taking satisfaction.
Smith
. Now, sir, show me the letter
mentioned
by Willoughby and alluded to in this note. I
wish to see the nature of an insult that you can
so easily pocket.
Sandford
. That letterO, that letter, sir, is
mislaid; but it is not worth your inspection: it is
a low piece of studied insolence, amounting in
its nature to a challenge, and as such he no doubt
intended it; but finding me ready to meet him,
he consults his own safety, and declines.
Smith
. Beware, captain Sandford, how you
trifle with
me!
If my suspicions be well founded,
and you have presumed to make me an actor in a
farceeternal woes rest upon you! Better had
you been dashed down the falls of Niagara than
thus
incur my resentment!
At this moment, before Sandford could
sufficiently
recover from his astonishment to reply, a
sudden
alarm was spread through the encampment,
the bugles rang, and the drums beat to arms. An
outpost of the army was attacked, by a large
body of British and Indians, and Scott was
ordered
out with a detachment to oppose them.
I shall volunteer; cried SmithIf you
have
courage, Sandford, do the same. So
saying
he rushed out, and the detachment with many
volunteers, were soon on the march. The enemy
were numerous, and the conflict obstinate.
Willoughby
and Smith fought side by side, and their
conduct was particularly applauded by the
gallant
Scott. In less than an hour the assailants
were dispersed with considerable loss, while that
of the Americans was comparatively trifling. This
affair, though small, served to test the merits of
38*
the officers engaged, and more ardor was never
displayed on a similar occasion. Vandeusen,
Madison, Cummins, Birdsall, and Towson, all
distinguished themselves in the performance of
their several duties. The brave Towson was
wounded in the hand, while voluntarily bearing
Scott's orders to officers of detachments.
As the victors were returning to camp, Smith
seized our hero by the hand, and with an oath
threatened to make that man eat his words who
should hereafter in his hearing express a doubt
of Willoughby's courage. George begged him,
with a goodnatured smile, to give himself no
trouble on his account, assuring him that he was
ever ready to forgive any man for merely
expressing
an erroneous opinion.
CHAPTER L.
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED.
Oh! she has deck'd his ruin with her love,
And made perdition pleasing.
Dryd. All for Love
.
It
was a delightful evening: the noxious
impurities
of a sultry atmosphere had just been
dissipated
by the red artillery of heaven, whose
receding murmurs were still heard at a distance,
in the east; the sun had sunk in golden splendor
behind the Canadian mountains, while the bow
of promise seemed to span the far-extended
territory
of freemen. The air was balmy, cool, and
refreshing; the moon-beam played on the
ever-restless
bosom of Niagara, and sparkled in the
rain-drops with which every leaf was freighted.
Both George and Reuben had (as usual, in a
summer evening) disencumbered their persons of
every martial habiliment, and were loosely attired
in light mantles of India calico.
Our hero had just finished a very tender epistle
to his Catharine, and arose to enjoy the beauties
of the evening scene, when he observed that
Reuben
was also busily employed with his pen. This
was not a circumstance so unusual as to excite
any surprise or curiosity in the mind of George,
had not his attendant, on this occasion, exhibited
evident tokens of embarrassment on being
discovered
,
and attempted to conceal the paper.
No treason, Reuben, I hope? asked George,
with one of his irresistible smiles of inquiry; no
intercourse with the enemy?
O, no, sir.
With a sweetheart, perhaps? Well
I
shall
not chide you.
The modest lad blushed deeply; and, after a
moment's hesitation, replied
I only write for amusement, sir.
What amuses Reuben in
writing
, replied
George might entertain his friend in
reading
if you think him deserving such confidence.
O sir, I have no single thought that I wish to
conceal from
you
. This is nothing secret; but I
am apprehensive that so accomplished a scholar
and poet as yourself, will be too severe a critic on
the simple effusions of my brain.
Is it
poetry
, then? I shall esteem the
privilege
of its perusal a fresh token of your
friendship
.
Come, Reuben, be under no
apprehensions
of severity from
me
. When has my
severity
ever given you pain?
Never, sir, replied Reuben, and therefore
I tremble to encounter it. It would break my
heart.
You shall never encounter itfaithful,
affectionate
boy! exclaimed George. I love you
as a brother, and in me you shall always meet a
brother's tenderness and affection.
And will you permit me to call
you
brother?
eagerly enquired Reuben.
Let the appellation be reciprocal. And now,
my little brother, on what subject have you been
exercising your poetic talent?
You must not laugh at me, stammered
Reuben
;
butyou have often commended a lively
little song, beginning
While in camp my soldier lives
and have been pleased to praise my voice, and
style of singing it. This has induced me to make
an attempt to adapt new words to the same air;
and, if you will excuse my vanity, I will submit
them to your inspection.
Your vanity, Reuben, will never be
obtrusive
,
while connected with your present modesty.
But now I must beg the favor of your singing this
productionand then, I am certain I shall be
pleased with it.
After a little hesitation, Reuben complied, and
sung the following words, in a faultless and
fascinating
style. If there was any imperfection in
the execution, it was attributable to the extreme
youth of the performer, which rendered his voice
rather too effeminate, though peculiarly sweet.
LOVE IN CAMP.
Sounds of war were swelling wild,
Fearful notes the bugle blew;
Infant
Love
, a timid child,
Trembled at the rat-tat-too.
But inspired by
Valor's
breath,
Love with war familiar grew,
Fearless view'd the strife of death,
Smiled to hear the rat-tat-too.
Swift a shaft at
Valor's
heart,
From the infant's bow-string flew;
Valor
heeded not the dart,
List'ning to the rat-tat-too.
Yet that dart was tipp'd with red,
Ella's heart-blood lent the hue:
But in vain had
Ella
bled,
Valor
loved the rat-tat-too.
Through the camp the infant stray'd,
Hope receding now from view;
Secret griefs his sighs betray'd,
Mingling with the rat-tat-too.
Valor
will not yield to Love,
Hope to Ella bids adieu;
Sad, desponding, widow'd dove,
Listless to the rat-tat-too.
The performance far exceeds my
expectation
,
said George, as Reuben concluded; but
I confess I do not understand the plot. Who is
this
Ella
?
The story is old, answered Reuben.
Ella
loved a young hero whose mistress was Glory;
and so eager was he in the pursuit of military
fame, that he was totally insensible to the charms
of beauty. She followed him to camp, disguised
in male attire, enjoyed his society, but never had
the courage to discover herself; till, languishing
and drooping with a hopeless passion, in the
hour of death she disclosed, at once, the secret of
her sex, and the consuming flame that preyed
upon her existence. Oh! my brother, would
you
not have pitied the unfortunate Ella?
Who could withhold his pity? But you tell
this story with the pathes of a lover. Is it
possible
that my brother Reuben has felt this
consuming
flame? Can the infant deity have
pierced
a bosom so young as
this?
As our hero spoke, he placed his hand on the
shrinking Reuben's palpitating heart, and started
with amazement. With eager haste he tore open
the ruffled cambric that veiled a female bosom,
and exclaimed
Rashimprudent girl! Who are you?
The counterfeit Reuben fell prostrate at the
feet of our hero; then clinging to his knees, and
raising a pair of streaming eyes, implored his
forgiveness
.
Oh! do not hate me, my brother! uttered
a feminine voice almost stifled with convulsive
sobs. You have allowed me the privilege of
calling you brotherOh! do not retract itit is
all the bliss I aspire to. Do not abandondo
not despisedo not murder with reproaches, one
whose only fault is loving you! To live in your
presenceto hear your voiceto meet your
smilesthis is all I askall I hopeOh! do not
deny me that! Pity, at least, the lost Sophia!
Lost, indeed! exclaimed the thunderstruck
George. Dreadfulfatal infatuation!
O think what must have been the extent of
my love! For that have I abandoned a husband
who adored me!parents, whose existence was
bound up in mine!broke a sister's heart!
forfeited the respect and esteem of the virtuous!
encountered the hardships of a camp!risked
the dangers of war! and, what I value most of all,
risked your displeasure!all for love!for the
sake of being near to youto hear you speak
to see you smileto nurse you in sicknessto
serve you in health! And will you hate me for
this, my brother? Oh! rather stab me to the
heart at once, and take that life which is devoted
to youa life which knows no joy but what it
derives from your friendship! Rather let your
sword pierce this bosom, and end my miseries by
death.
As Sophia uttered these last words, she rose
upon her knees, and throwing open her loose
attire
,
displayed a bosom heaving with agitation
and doubtful hopeswhite as alabaster
beautiful
beyond description. Her black eyes,
suffused
with tears, were fixed with a melting
fondness
on those of George, and through them she
poured her very soul, emanating in the dazzling
rays of love. George was bewilderedshe saw
her advantageand, suddenly rising, threw
herself
into his arms.
Through her parting robe, the alternate breast
With youth wild-throbbing, on his dazzled gaze
In full luxuriance rose.He drew
Such madd'ning draughts of beauty to the soul,
As for a while o'erwhelm'd his raptured thought
With luxury too daring.
Our hero had frequently stood firm and unmoved
when assailed by a host of British invincibles
conquerors in Egypt, Spain, and France; he had
heard unappalled the savage war-whoop, and
encountered all the terrors of an Indian fight,
without suffering a nerve to quivera joint to
tremble. But now, his nerves quiveredhis
joints trembledhis bosom palpitated. He was
closely, warmly pressed in the arms of an
amorous
,
melting beauty, whose soul was dissolved in
love:
Loose, unattired, warm, tender, full of wishes.
I have never asserted that my hero was
more
than a man. Sophia conquered.
Let fastidious virtue close the volume. I write
nothing but truth.
CHAPTER LI.
REMORSE AND REPENTANCE.
Consideration, like an angel, came,
And whipt the offending
Adam
out of him;
Leaving his body as a Paradise;
To envelope and contain celestial spirits.
Shakspeare
.
At
the conclusion of the thirty-ninth chapter of
this history,
[20]
[20]
See page 60, of this volume.
I asserted that our hero (on the
occasion
there mentioned) was unhappy without
being guilty; which assertion was followed by
this exclamation
How much
MORE
unhappy
would George have been, had he been guilty!
This reflection alone, at that time, had a tendency
to remove his uneasiness, and restore his
composure
.
But now, alas! George had no such balm
for his wounded mind. He was now guilty
unhappy
miserable;
nor could all the fascinations
of the frail Sophiaher boundless love, or her
lavished caresses, banish the gnawing worm of
remorse from his bosom. Every returning
morning
witnessed his contrition, and the formation of
good resolutions, which every returning evening
dissolved into air. Trembling lest habit should
at length entirely strip Vice of that haggard
deformity
which had always kept him aloof from
her haunts, (but which was now daily becoming
less odious to his view) he resolved and
re-resolved
to cast off the rosy yoke which debased
him, and no longer endure the goading thorns it
concealed. But again the Syren charmedagain
the victim fell; resistance grew weaker at every
trial, and the foul fiend whisperedO, who
would stand, when 'tis so sweet to fall!
Once moresighed the bewildered George,
only
once more
will I taste the intoxicating cup,
and then dash it forever from my lips! Rash,
imprudent, infatuated youth! His Satanic
majesty
has not a more crafty minister in his whole
court, than this dangerous, insinuating
Once
More
. While you admit him at your
counsel-board
,
true Repentance (the only guide to
reformation
)
is kept aloof, and cannot enter.
As George was sitting one evening, in his
quarters, suffering rather than enjoying the
caresses
of his amorous inamorato, who hung upon
his neck with growing fondness, tenderly
complaining
of his coldness, and pressing her
glowing
lips to his as if she'd pluck up kisses by
the rootshis eye accidentally (as 'tis called)
rested on a letter, directed to his father, which
had for more than a week remained neglected in
his card-rack. It was the envelope of that which
he had addressed to Catharine on the fatal
evening
39
which witnessed his first aberration from the
path of innocence. A letter for Catharine had
always heretofore been hurried to the
post-office
,
after receiving a kiss on the seal, which
was there to remain in torpidity until
resuscitated
by the warmth of her own lips. But now a
most tender epistle had been written, enclosed in
the usual envelope, and thenforgotten! A train
of reflections now rushed across the mind of our
hero, which so powerfully affected him, that he
started on his feet, clasped his hands in
convulsive
agony, and involuntarily exclaimed, with a
vehemence that terrified the guilty fair one from
whose circling arms he had torn himself
Oh! Catharine!Catharine! How have I
damn'd myself!
With this exclamation, he rushed out,
leaving
Sophia drowned in tears. The night was
extremely dark, except when the lightning broke
at intervals through a black heavy cloud in the
southern horizon; the rain descended in torrents,
and George was without his hat and coat, with a
thin mantle streaming behind him in the breeze,
as he flitted along like the genius of the tempest,
heedless of the path he took, and insensible to his
situation. The sudden challenge of a sentinel
awoke him from his reverie, and was repeated
before
he could recollect the countersign. The
name of the immortal Pike secured him a pass,
and in a few minutes he found himself on the
river bank. Here he threw himself on the wet
ground, and gave free and audible vent to his
self-reproaches.
Oh! that I could recal the last accursed
week! he exclaimed with bitternessand
regain
my lost peace! The foulthe monstrous
crime of
adultery!
O, my God! why was I
reserved
for this! Why called to a trial so far
beyond
my feeble strength!
Then starting upon his feet, and looking
wildly
about him, he continued
Is
this
George Washington Willoughby!
this
the
son
of Edward Willoughby!the
brother
of that image of love, purity, and truth, that
moves in the person of Amelia?
[21]
[21]

these
the limbs which she fears
may be mangled in battle? Would to Heaven
they
had been
hewn to pieces, before they
encircled
a wanton
adultress!
Better had this form
been trampled to atoms in the field of honor, than
to lie panting with guilty rapture on the bosom
of lasciviousness! But here, on my knees, I
swear
Swear not! uttered a low and solemn voice
almost in his ear. Add not the crime of
perjury
to that of adultery.
George started from the posture he was
assuming
,
and beheld by his side a tall dark figure. At
that moment a bright flash of lightning dissipated
for a moment the gloom, and he recognised the
Mysterious Chief
. Silent and abashed, George
stood like a guilty culprit awaiting a heavy
sentence
;
he dared not raise his eyes, but kept them
fixed on the warrior's feet.
Swear notbut repent; uttered the chief,
after a moment's pause. Wish not to recal the
past
, seek rather to prevent the
future
. What is
once done, can never be undone. The stain is
fixed, and oceans of tears can never efface it. You
never can be the same Willoughby that you have
been. But though the stain of your crime is
indelible
,
as yet it rests upon the surface, and has
not contaminated the interior. You can never
wash it from the
skin
, but you
can
prevent its
pervading
the vitals; and unless you
do
prevent it
wo be unto your soul!
How can I prevent it?enquired George,
timidly raising his eyes.
By repentance.
Have you not just witnessed the bitterness of
my repentance?the poignancy of that remorse
which makes me hate and detest myself?
It is not repentance.
Not repentance!
Remorse is sometimes an inducement to the
work of repentance, but it is not repentance itself.
Genuine repentance is not a mere sorrow or
regret
for having committed certain offences; but
it is
the abstaining from committing such offences
.
The Almighty has summed it up in these four
words
Cease to do evil
. Ceasing to commit
a sin, is the only way to overcome the propensity
to its commission; and without overcoming
it
, it
will overcome
you
, and become the ruling love of
your soul. No soul can be happy whose ruling
love is evil.
I hate my crime! exclaimed George,
detest
and abominate it. I hate myself for being
guilty of it.
I know you do, replied the chief, and
therefore I said the stain was yet on the surface.
But, beware of repetition! Every addition to the
stain sinks deeper and deeper, and its progress to
the pure temple of divinity within, increases in
geometrical
progression. If evil enters there, the Lord
of the temple
must
depart, and it will soon become
a den of thieves. Your hate and detestation of
adultery was less yesterday, than it was eight
days before; repeat the crime, and it will be still
less to-morrow; in a short time, what now tears
your bosom with remorse, would scarcely agitate
it with a sighinstead of hating, you would soon
contemplate the crime with complacency, and
afterwards love it. Then would the fatal stain
have reached the soul, and marked it for an
associate
of devils.
I would have swornI will now most
solemnly
affirm never to
Make no resolutions, interrupted the chief,
if you found them on the basis of self-sufficiency.
Place not too much confidence in your strength
independent of divine assistance. You ask why
you was called to a trial beyond your strength?
Every trial is beyond the strength of a man who
trusts to his own powers aloneno trial is beyond
his strength if he is always careful gratefully to
bear in mind the source from whence that strength
proceeds. You had forgotten this important truth,
though it has been so often inculcated by your
virtuous father, and you was permitted to fall, in
order to have it more deeply impressed on your
mindto become fully convinced of your own
weakness, when not upheld by the hand of mercy.
You had become self-confident, grown vain of the
good propensities which had been lent you,
forgotten
from whom you derived them, and said
they are my own. You renounced the society
of others, until
they
reform their
morals!
Now let
my pupil reform his ownor he will hear the
voice of his Mentor no more.
39*
Your pupil
will
reform; replied George
with energy. You know my heartis it not
sincere?
Learn to know it yourself. You are at this
moment entertaining a resolution to abstain from
sin. Beware how you rob Heaven by calling that
resolution your own. It is a spiritual dictate, and
will only become yours so far as you obey it.
Think it your own, and it vanishes. Ask for it
in sincerity, and it will come again.
With Heaven's assistance, I will be all you
wish, uttered George, with tears of gratitude in
his eyes; and for such assistance will I daily
apply; I will also pour out my soul in gratitude
for the peculiar privilege I enjoy in your friendly
counsel; he who would not become good with
such a monitor, must be lost indeed!
If your privilege in this respect is peculiar,
it is the fault of man that it is so. Every human
being
might
enjoy a
superior
privilege, if each
one would move in the orbit for which he was
designed. You was rapidly descending from
yours, and would soon have lost me.
Kind being! to catch me in the fall.
That was not in my power. Divine mercy
arrested your fall, and held your suspended by the
thread of reflection. Then it was my province to
step in, and admonish you to reclimb the slender
web by which you hung, and regain your lost
footing in the skies.
Accept my gratitude.
It is due to Heaven alone. Never again
forget
this short precept
Do your duty, and leave
the result to Heaven
.
I will ever endeavor to bear it in mind, and
regulate my future conduct by it.
To-morrow will call for an exercise of the
precept. The bearer of important news is at
handreceive it as you ought, and be a man.
Do
your
dutyand place your trust in
Providence
.
So saying, the
Mysterious Chief
walked
deliberately
away towards the American camp, and
was soon lost to our hero's view.
The rain had now ceased, and the moon broken
forth; and although our hero was wet to the skin,
he continued to stroll along on the river bank,
until the Newark clock told the hour of two; he
then directed his course towards the camp, and
proceeded to his quarters. Sophia was still
watching, almost distracted with grief for his
absence
,
and fears for his safety.
O George! cried she, clinging to his
bosom
you
do not love me!
I have never deceived you, Sophia, with any
assurances that I did love you.
But does not love like mine deserve some
return
?
Is it kind, George, is it grateful to chill it
with such coldness? Let the happy Catharine
be your wife, but O, do not spurn poor Sophia
entirely
from you. No wife can love with affection
like that I feel for you. Think you that Catharine
would sacrifice for you what I have sacrificed?
If she did, I should pity
her
as I now pity
you
.
Sophia! you have been successful in rendering
me the most miserable of beings, and the cause of
this effect you call
love!
Dreadful profanation of
that sacred word! You have made me wretched!
and the only way that I can recover the peace
which you have banished from my soul, is to
banish
you from my arms. I will not become the
slave of a vice that I detest.
Kill me, my love! cried Sophia, throwing
herself on her knees before him, and clasping his
in her arms, kill me here at your feetbut, Oh!
do not banish me from your bosom! Call not the
mutual bliss we have tasted by so harsh a name.
Can that (continued she rising and throwing her
arms around his neck) be vicious which makes
us happy? If you would but consent to be as
happy in my arms as I am in yoursif you
would discard these cold prejudices which have
made the world wretched, and give up your whole
soul to love as I do, you would, like me, know no
other care but the sweet pain of a short
separation
,
which only increases the coming rapture of
the next meeting; you would permit no fears of
the future to mar the present bliss, nor thus fly
from my fond embrace, to wander about in
solitude, darkness, and rain, until you become
drenched and chilled, as your whole frame now is.
Come, my love, discard that frown, and let me
thaw that frozen cheek in my warm bosom, where
the flame of love forever burns.
Sophia!there's fascination, madness, death
in your embrace! I must notcannotwill not
again be the victim of its witchcraft! Unhappy
girl! you are cheating yourself with a delusive
phantom, which will soon vanish like a morning
dream, and leave you awake to the keenest
despair
a
guilty, wretched creaturewith no
present
peaceno future hopes! Are you so
infatuated
as to risk eternal pain for momentary
pleasure
?
If you areI will notso help me
Heaven
!
be any more a sharer in the guilt. Let me
conjure you to return to
To whom shall I return? interrupted the
wretched girl. Oh! George! I have no home
no friends! A husband's vengeance would
pursue
mea parent's curse overwhelm me. Every
door is shut against me. To whom then can I
return? O, George! to no one; with you I must
remain, until you kill me with unkindness, or
compel
me to kill myself, by abandoning me to
despair
.
You came to me unsolicited, Sophia;
imposed
yourself on me for a boy, and in that character
stole my affections; and then, in one fatal,
unguarded
moment, robbed me of innocence, and
destroyed my happiness. But the robbery shall
be no further extended. Whatever pangs my
pity for your wretchedness may inflict. I deserve
them all, and will endure them. However
severe
the trial,
we must part!
If you tax me with
cruelty, I cannot help it; I
will
do
my
duty, and
look to Heaven for the result. Let me conjure
you, then, Sophia, to repent of the past, and live
in future so as to regain the lost respect of
mankind
,
the esteem of your friends, and the
approbation
of Heaven. The extent of your
transgression
is a secret to all but myself. The crime of
deserting a jealous husband may be overlooked
by the worldyour virtue may never be
suspected
,
and thus many obstacles are removed from
the path of reformation. Return a penitent to
your father, and I know that he will forgive you.
I know the path of repentance winds up a steep
and thorny hill; but by perseverance you may
yet reach the summit, and again find peace and
happiness. This I adviseI conjure you to do;
no pecuniary obstacle shall interrupt or deter
you, for my father's liberality will enable me to
supply you with every comfort.
Sophia remained sunk on a chair in a
speechless
,
tearless agony, during the latter part of this
address. She could not weep, and her blood-shot
eyes stared with a terrific wildness on the speaker.
When he ceased, she attempted to reply, but
labored some time as if choked for utterance.
Both her hands were prest on her heart, and her
bosom heaved in tumultuous agitation. At length
she spoke
No, no, it will not break! Its juices are
turned
to gall. You have tugged at the vital cords,
till harmony is changed to discord, bliss to wo,
love to hate. Were my slighted kisses poison,
could my lips but emit the scorpion's venom, I
would once more, in spite of your resistance, press
them to yours, till yours became cold in death.
You have driven an angel from my bosom, and a
devil has usurped its seat.
Sophia! are you mad!
Yes!raving. My brain's on fire! You have
trampled on my heart, and converted the nectar
of love to wormwood. I hate you more than ever
I loved youI risked the loss of Heaven for my
loveI would willingly incur certain damnation,
to make you feel my hate. Willingly would I
plunge into the burning centre of hell, could I
drag you thither with me. Hark! the reveillee
beats! I know my instrumentand shall have
my revenge.
Before the astonished George could reply, she
rushed past him, and disappeared; while he
proceeded
to dress for the review, with more
composure
than he had for some time experienced.
CHAPTER LII.
THE FORTUNE OF WAR.
Know that true valor soars above
What this world calls misfortune and affliction;
These are not
real
, but
apparent
ills,
That give the mind occasion to exert
Its hidden strength, and throw out into practice
Virtues which shun the day, and lie concealed
In the smooth seasons and the calms of life.
Addison's Calo.
When
George reached his quarters, after the
parade was over, he was surprised to find an
Indian
awaiting his return; and his surprise was
not lessened when, in the graceful warrior, he
recognised
the youthful Logan. Without making
any answer to the eager inquiries of our hero,
Logan hastily delivered him a letter, saying
That paper will speak every thinglook
look! George knew his father's hand, and
tearing
it open, read as follows:
Cleveland, Ohio
,
July 20th
, 1813.
Call all your native fortitude to your aid, my
son, for the intelligence I have to communicate
is afflicting. Catharine Fleming is safe under
my protectionwould I could say she was well.
Her amiable mother has joined the rest of her
unfortunate family in a better world. Fleming
is a prisoner of war, and their house is in ashes.
Mulberry Grove exhibits nothing but a black
heap of smoking ruins. First recover that
and then thou shalt hear further.
Before George reached the last sentence, the
characters swam before his eyeshis limbs
tottered
,
and he was obliged to cling to the door for
support. Logan helped him to a seat, and after
a powerful struggle with his feelings, he
regained
sufficient composure to proceed.
In my last I informed you that the
depredations
of the savages were extended along the
shores of this lake, and that many of the
inhabitants
had been killed or made prisoners. But a
severe check which they afterwards received
from the gallant colonel Ball, had lulled our fears
to rest, in this vicinity.
On Sunday morning, the eighteenth instant,
young Logan arrived at the Grove, and informed
me that he had been solicited to join a party of
Seneca and Tuscorora Indians, whom Boyd had
consented to receive into the American service,
and that he was then on his way to Fort George
for that purpose. On learning that you was at
that encampment, he consented to stop until I
could prepare a letter and a small remittance for
you, which I knew could be safely confided to so
trusty a messenger. When night came, Logan,
as usual, spread his blanket in the porch, and
slept with his rifle in his hand.
About midnight I was awakened by the
report
of fire-arms, and springing from my bed,
found my chamber illumined by a bright light
that shone through my window, and before I
could slip on my clothes, Logan flew into the
room and informed me that a party of Indians had
fired the stable, and were now approaching the
house. The alarm had now spread through the
house, and the shrieks of the housekeeper and
her two daughters, added not a little to the general
consternation.
While my laborers were hurrying on their
clothes and seizing their rifles, which we always
kept loaded, I took a position to reconnoitre the
enemy, and by the light of the conflagrated
outhouses
,
(which by this time were all participating
in the fate of the stable) I ascertained their force
to be not more than twenty, and that a retreat was
open for the women through the garden. They
wanted no urging to fly, and I directed them to
conceal themselves in the woods until the danger
was over. They had scarcely left the house,
when a volley of rifle slugs was poured against it,
which did no other damage, however, than
shatter
the windows, and perforate the wall.
Our force was but twelve men, including
myself. Five of them followed Logan through
the garden to attack their rear, while the rest of
us made a sortie on their front. We met them on
the platform, as they were loading their pieces,
and came upon them so suddenly that it threw
them into disorder, they having no idea that my
house was a garrison. Every rifle dropped its
man, in front and rear. The survivors returned
our fire, and then retreated with their customary
yell. We followed up the advantage we had
gained, and a second discharge so diminished
their numbers, that we imagined the contest was
terminated; when, turning my eyes towards
Fleming's, I saw his habitation in flames, and a
band of about thirty savages rapidly
approaching
the Grove.
Three of our little band were badly wounded,
but no one was dismayed. I hastily posted them
behind the stone wall which separates the little
orchard from the road, with orders to reserve
their fire until the advancing savages (with whom
the fugitives had now formed a junction) were
passing the muzzles of our pieces. One of our
40
party, however, imprudently, fired too soon, and
totally defeated the object of my arrangement.
The savages paused a moment, and then assailed
our little breast-work with such fury that it was
soon carried, while our fire was wasted at
random
.
Our party was surrounded, and nearly
cut to pieces; Logan fought like a blood-hound,
beating down the foe with the but end of his rifle,
until the stock was shivered in his hands; he
then seized a hatchet from a fallen chief, and
literally cut a path through the enemy, by which
three of us effected our retreat; the remainder
were either slain, or made prisoners. Logan,
myself, and a young Irishman whom I had lately
employed, were all that escaped the contest, and
we precipitately fled across the meadow towards
Cleveland, leaving the enemy masters of the field.
When we reached the road, we ventured to pause,
and looking back, saw the flames just bursting
through the roof of our habitation. A horrid yell
of the savages announced their hellish joy at the
sight, and we could now see them preparing to
decamp, several of the painted devils being
mounted on my horses.
The sound of an approaching bugle now
saluted
our ears, and in a few minutes a small corps
of mounted riflemen met us on the road from
Cleveland. The alarm had extended to that
village
,
and these brave fellows had immediately
assembled to pursue the barbarous enemy. I
gave their leader every necessary direction, and
the little company again set forward on a gallop.
The day was now dawning, and I determined
to seek some intelligence respecting the family of
Fleming. With the most fearful presentiments I
approached that once happy seat of virtue and
hospitality. The ruins of the dwelling-house
were still blazing, but the barn had not been
fired. As we approached that building, Logan
directed my attention to a track of blood on the
ground, and my own curdled with horror. I
rushed
forward determined to know the worst.
The barn door was open, and we entered,
when a sight met our view, calculated to melt the
stoutest heart with pity, and nerve the weakest
with courage. On the cold bare floor sat
Catharine
,
supporting on her knees the head of her
mother
,
and endeavoring to stanch with her linen
the blood that issued from a wound in that
mother's
breast. Unfortunately Logan first met the
eye of Catharine, who uttered a piercing shriek,
and sunk lifeless on the bleeding bosom of her
mother. Mrs. Fleming raised her languid eyes
to me, and attempted to speak. Fly for
assistance
!
I exclaimed to Logan, who disappeared
at the word. Assisted by Patrick, I succeeded in
removing the females to a crib of straw, spread
over them our outside garments, (for both of them
were in their night-frocks) and screened them
from the morning air as well as circumstances
would permit. Catharine soon recovered from
her swoon, but wept so excessively that I trembled
for her heart. I now examined the wound in her
mother's bosom, and shuddered on discovering
that it was made with a rifle ball! She observed
my consternation, and faintly uttered, as she
pressed my hand
I know itI know it. I am sensible that my
hour is almost come, and I am resigned to my
fate. But, O, protect and comfort poor
Catharine
me
you cannot help. O, my poor husband!
what may be his fate! Should Catharine be
indeed
an orphan, you will not desert her?
A short captivity, I replied, is, I trust, the
worst fate that my friend is doomed to suffer from
the enemy. In any event, however, I solemnly
promise to be a friend and father to Catharine.
Logan now entered, with several persons of
both sexes, whom he had met flying towards the
scene of devastation, to furnish every assistance
in their power. A litter was procured for Mrs.
Fleming, on which she was gently placed, and
borne by four men to Cleveland. Fleming's
family
waggon followed, with the almost distracted
Catharine, supported between two of her female
friends, assisted by myself. On our arrival, a
surgeon was procured, who immediately
pronounced
the wound of Mrs. Fleming to be mortal;
and, in an hour afterwards, she expired.
The mounted riflemen who pursued the
Indians
,
succeeded in driving them into the woods,
killed two, and made one prisoner. I directed
Logan to examine this Indian, and from his report
I am convinced that Fleming has fallen into their
hands alive and unhurt. Four of my little band
were left lifeless in the orchard along with seven
of the savages, who were all buried last evening
in the spot where they fell. Most of the prisoners
are severely wounded. Those who fell on the
platform, are buried in the smoking ruins of the
house.
Of the horrid transactions at Fleming's, I can
give you no account, until Catharine becomes
sufficiently
composed to relate what passed under
her observation. The body of Susan (who was
married, soon after you left us, last summer, to a
very worthy laborer on Fleming's plantation) was
found at some distance from the barn, mangled in
a manner too horrid for descriptionan unborn
infant, which had been torn from her womb, lay
near her feet, cloven nearly in two by a
tomahawk
!
The unhappy husband is probably a
prisoner
with Fleming. The females of my family,
who remained concealed in the woods until after
sunrise, have arrived in safety at Cleveland.
The bodies of Mrs. Fleming and Susan, will
be buried to-morrow, and will be followed by a
larger procession of real mourners, than this place
has ever exhibited on any former occasion.
Catharine is, at present, inconsolable; but
God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb. I
have communicated the melancholy event to her
uncle, William O'Hara, who has joined Perry's
squadron at Erie, and holds some respectable
office on board the commodore's brig.
To-morrow
I shall write to my friend Harrison,
requesting
him to exert his influence to procure the
release
of the prisoners on parole; or, at least, that
of Fleming, whose presence would tend, more
than any thing else, to restore the tranquility of
Catharine's mind.
Logan will make no delay in flying to his
preserver with this letter. If he can serve you
in any thing, make him happy by employing him.
A remittance, you must not expect; but if you
are absolutely in want, draw on your uncle in
Boston, and the draught will be duly honored.
My loss is severe, as not a single article was
saved at Mulberry Grove; but this is a loss which
can soon be repaired. My crops bid fair to be
excellent, and as I have now no barns, I shall sell
them on the field.
40*
I shall write again soon, when you may
expect
further particulars. In the mean time,
forget
not to place a due reliance on Providence,
who orders all things for the best; and still believe
me to be, as ever, your affectionate father,
E. WILLOUGHBY.
For several minutes after reading this letter,
George paced the floor in silence; then, pausing
suddenly, he raised his clasped hands in agony
towards Heaven, and while the big tear trembled
in either eye, with faltering voice he fervently
ejaculated
Save her! Almighty God! O, pity
me
, and
save her! Then suddenly dropping his hands,
and fixing his eyes on the ground, he added in a
mournful tonethat is an impious prayer. A
wretch like
me
to ask so great a blessing!a
devil pleading for an angel!and not pleading
for
her
happiness, but for
my own!
O, take her,
righteous Heaven! if it be thy will, take her to
thyself! Let her be happy, and I will kiss the
rod. It was through her pure bosom alone, that
the blow could reach my heart, and thus the
innocent
suffer with the guilty. And shall I wish her
unmerited sufferings to be prolonged? O no, the
will of Heaven be done. And yet, to
lose
her
to forfeit the bliss anticipated for years!But I
deserve it all---I am not worthy of such
excellence
.
At that dreadful hour, while she,
surrounded
with horrors, was supporting a bleeding,
dying mother, I was in the arms of guilt! 'Tis
just'tis just! I will not complain. The storm
is subsidedthe will of Heaven be doneI am
resigned.
This resignation was, in a few days, rewarded
by the following letter from his father:
Cleveland, Ohio
,
July 25
, 1813.
I am happy, my dear boy, to inform you, that
by a courier, who is travelling express from
Harrison's
head-quarters to Erie, I have received a
letter from Fleming, written on board an English
gun-boat in Sandusky Bay, just preparing to sail
for Malden. He is anxious to learn the fate of his
family, and fears the worst. Catharine herself
has undertaken to relieve this suspense, by
writing
immediately, and as flags are frequently
passing
between the two armies, there will be no
difficulty
attending its conveyance, except the
customary
inspection of its contents, which is of no
consequence. I am sensible of Harrison's
disposition
to oblige me, and he has promised to
exert
his influence in procuring Fleming's release.
May the choicest blessings of Heaven rest upon
the hero's head.
The certainty of yet possessing a father,
although
in captivity, has produced a happy effect
on the mind of Catharine, whose grief has now
subsided into a pensive calm. Her meek and
humble reliance on the love and wisdom of her
Heavenly Parent, has diffused a gentle quiet
through her soul, which has already exhibited its
beneficial influence on her bodily health. Such,
my son, are the delightful effects of a genuine
christian faith. As you value happiness, both
here and hereafter, never lose sight of this beacon
to the soul; and always bear in mind, that
no
faith can be genuine, which is not connected with a
good moral life
.
One of Harrison's reconnoitring or scouting
parties fell in with the savages, (after our
mounted
men had driven them into the woods) killed
four of their number, and retook two prisoners;
the remainder escaped to the lake shore, where a
large body of the enemy was assembled.
One of the re-captured prisoners is M`
Dougal
,
husband of the murdered Susan. From his
statement, combined with that of Catharine, and
both taken in connexion with Fleming's letter, the
following must be a tolerable correct account of
the transactions at Fleming's, on that disastrous
night:
The savages had fired the house, before any
alarm was given; and the whole family
narrowly
escaped perishing in their beds. Each one
flew, as fear impelled. Mrs. Fleming had
fainted
with terror, and her husband was bearing her
in his arms towards the barn, when a shot passed
under his left armpit, and entered her bosom; of
this, however, he was ignorant, until he felt
himself
covered with blood. Scarcely had he entered
the barn, when he was seized by the savages, who
tore the bleeding sufferer from his arms, and
dashed her on the cheerless floor. Raving like a
fury, Fleming scuffled until he was completely
overpowered; he was then forced away, and saw
neither wife nor daughter more.
Catharine had fled some distance, but
perceiving
that none of her friends followed, she
paused, and then as swiftly retraced her steps.
The savages were retreating, the house wrapped
in flames, and not a friend to be seen! O, George!
what must have been the mental anguish of that
poor girl! Shivering in the night air, from which
she was protected only by her linen tunic;
appalled
by the yell of triumph which was
reiterated
ed by the painted monsters, as they departed in
the full blaze of her burning mansion, and in
total
ignorance as to the fate of her parents!
While she stood aghast and horror-struck,
gazing on the maddening spectacle before her, a
deep groan issuing from within the barn (against
which she was now leaning) attracted her
attention
.
She immediately entered the
building
,
and by the light of the flames, which
shone through the expanded door, she
recognised
her dying mother, weltering in her own blood!
Why did not the distressed girl's heart-strings
crack at such a sight? Because God always
gives strength equal to the task imposed.
She raised her mother's head on her knees,
and endeavored to stanch the wound at which
her life's blood was issuing---it was all she could
do. Speak to me, my dear mother, O, speak
to your poor Catharine! she several times
exclaimed
.
Her mother opened her eyes, pressed
her daughter's hand, and then faintly asked for
her husband; but of his fate Catharine was also
ignorant. Fly, and leave me, Catharine; the
flames will reach the barn. Then we will both
die together, my mother, was the sweet angel's
reply---there are no assassins in Heaven. The
Indians are gone, and I fear not the fire. Such
was their situation, when we found them.
M`Dougal and his wife were seized as they
issued from the house; she was struck on the
head with a hatchet, but her husband was
fortunately
forced away too quickly to witness the
subsequent barbarities inflicted on the wife of his
bosom.
Fleming has a sister, who emigrated to this
country with her family, some years before him
self, and who is now a widow, residing in the
village of Ithaca, in the state of New-York.
Although
she married in Belfast, her husband was
an American, and owned several valuable estates
on the shores of Cayuga Lake. His name was
Woodcock; he has been dead about two years,
and has left one son to inherit the bulk of his
fortune
.
Mrs. Woodcock has repeatedly requested
her brother to permit Catharine to spend a
summer
with her at Ithaca, urging that as there was
but one daughter in the family, her time ought to
be divided between the brother and sister. Mrs.
Fleming, however, could not endure the thought
of a separation from her daughter, and so the
request
of the aunt has never been complied with.
But at Catharine's request, I have now written to
Mrs. Woodcock on the subject, and given a
history
of our recent misfortunes; I have requested
her answer to be directed to me at Erie, to which
place I shall take her niece in a few days, as I
think a change of scene and air will contribute to
her restoration. As soon as I have settled my
business here, and procured a suitable lad to drive
my carriage, I shall depart; so, if you intend to
write soon, direct to that place, also, as I shall
spend several days there with our cousin
Latamore
.

From Ithaca, I shall proceed to Boston,
and there reside, until the safety of these shores
is secured, either by victory or peace. Adieu.

CHAPTER LIII.
A FURLOUGH.
Walk hence with that,
And manage it against despairing thoughts
Shakspeare
.
The
army at Fort George was now in a state
of inactivity, (excepting some trifling affairs of
outposts) and George had much time for
reflection
;
but his reflections were not always of the
most pleasing kind. The counterfeit Reuben
had disappeared, and no one knew what had
become
of him. Anxious to save from deeper ruin
this infatuated victim of a criminal passion, our
hero was indefatigable in his enquiries; and, at
length, began to fear that the waves of Niagara
had received the self-devoted wretch, whose
parting
words, he recollected, were,
I know my
instrument
,
and shall have my revenge
.
Had George deliberately studied, planned,
and executed a scheme of seductionhad he, by
specious promises, obtained the affections and
confidence of an artless girl, and basely violated
her honor---had he initiated her into the paths of
vice, and then cruelly withdrawn his protection,
abandoning her to shame and povertyhad this
been the case, the self-immolation of his unhappy
victim would have been
revenge
indeed---the
severest
wound in her power to inflict; a wound
that could hardly fail
To bring repentance to her lover,
And wring his bosom.
But this was not the case; George had not been
thus deeply guilty; and yet the bare idea that
such might be the fate of the frail Sophia, filled
his bosom with no very enviable sensations. He
had sufficient cause for self-reproach; he
consented
to her ruin, without making an attempt to
save her. Had he manfully resisted temptation,
and set her a pattern of heroic virtue, she might
have lived to thank him for the lesson. But,
instead
of supporting, he, alas! had fallen with her!
In order, if possible, to divert such unpleasant
reflections, he obtained a short furlough, to visit
his father at Erie. I will not positively assert,
that, in taking this step, he thought
only
of his
father; of this, the reader is at liberty to judge
for himself. I only know that he travelled to
Erie with an expedition that would have done
honor to an express courier.
It would be difficult to determine which
exhibited
the greatest degree of surprise at the meeting,
the major, at seeing his sonor his son at
not
seeing Catharine. The latter had departed
several
hours before, in company with her aunt and
cousin, and was now far distant, on the road
to Mayville, in the state of New-York. Our
hero's velocity in travelling had actually
prevented
the interview he so ardently desired; he
having
passed the carriage which contained
Catharine
,
too precipitately for either party to
recognise
each other. He was now almost tempted to
pursue them, and accompany them to Ithaca; but
the half-formed resolution was soon dissipated by
reflection, and his chagrin quickly yielded to the
native gentleness of his disposition.
The major now proceeded to inform our hero,
that as soon as his letter had reached Ithaca, Mrs.
Woodcock, (accompanied by her son in his own
carriage) set out immediately for Erie, and
arrived
but three days later than the major himself.
As their carriage was much more comfortable
than that in which he had travelled from
Cleveland
,
he cheerfully resigned his fair charge to such
protectors, and concluded to tarry a week longer
in Erie. Catharine (he added) is much
improved
in health and spirits since the date of my
last letter. Could she again embrace her father,
she would be comparatively happy. Nothing, my
son, but genuine piety could have supported her
under trials so peculiarly severe.
Perry's squadron was now lying in the harbor,
having returned from a short cruise to receive
reinforcements
.
Major Willoughby had received
an invitation to dine with the commodore, on
board the Lawrence, and his son resolved to
accompany
him. This was an unexpected pleasure
to Perry, as it was also to the gallant Elliot, who
had just arrived from Sacket's Harbor with one
hundred volunteers for the squadron. Elliot had
been appointed to the command of the Niagara,
a vessel of equal force with the Lawrence; and
besides these two brigs, which carried twenty
guns each, there were in the harbor six others of
inferior force. The whole were now completely
manned and equipped, and every soul on board
was panting to meet the enemy.
After the cloth was removed, and the wine had
begun to circulate, several toasts were given by
different officers present. The major was
solicited
for a sentiment, and gave the following:
The hero who voluntarily risks his own life, to
preserve that of an individual, would think it no
sacrifice to die for his country
. George knew
not how to understand this sentiment, but the
scarlet blush that mantled on the cheek of one
41
young officer at table, evinced to the whole
company
that it was not unintelligible to
him
. No
notice, however, was taken of the circumstance,
and the modest midshipman soon after retired.
On reaching their lodgings, (to which they
were accompanied by O'Hara) George requested
an explanation of his father's toast, which was
given by the major in the following words:
Yesterday evening, towards sunset, the
weather
being remarkably fine, Mrs. Latamore and
myself prevailed on Catharine to accompany me
in a little excursion on horseback, an exercise of
which she is extremely fond, and which we now
recommended as beneficial to her health. Her
aunt approved the motion, and Catharine
consented
.
We proceeded, at a gentle pace, on the
Erie turnpike, about three miles. On our return,
the report of a fowling-piece in an adjacent field,
so frightened the animal on which Catharine was
seated, that he became totally unmanageable, and
after rearing and plunging a moment, set off
towards
the town with a speed truly alarming, and
which the feeble Catharine was unable to check.
Almost distracted for her safety, I urged on my
more tardy beast, but was at some distance in the
rear, when I observed a foot-passenger dart into
the middle of the road, and, at the imminent hazard
of his life or limbs, seize the bridle of her steed
with one hand, while he caught the precipitated
Catharine in the other armfree from injury, save
the effects of her fright. This was the noble
youth alluded to in my toast, and he was present
at table.
That young midshipman?
The same.
May he become admiral of the whole
American
navy! cried O'Hara, with an oath.
What would I not give to be that
midshipman
!
exclaimed Georgeand then blushed, as
he met his father's smile.
Come, come, my son, said the majordo
not compel me to chide you for selfishness. You
have already had the privilege of saving Miss
Fleming once, from even greater danger. Will
not that suffice?
Who is the happy fellow?
All in good time, my son. On coming up to
them, I sprang from my horse, and assisted in
supporting the trembling girl, who assured me
that she was perfectly safe and unhurt. She then
turned to her deliverer, and thanked him with a
grace peculiar to herselfpossibly
you
may
conceive
of it, if she has ever thanked you for being
the instrument of her deliverance at Richmond.
George again blushed.
I eagerly united with her, continued the
major
,
in expressing our grateful sense of the
obligation
under which his gallantry had laid us;
but he modestly declined every idea of merit in
the achievement, said he could claim no gratitude
for merely performing his duty, and begged us to
inform him in what manner he could be of farther
service. Catharine would not again trust herself
on horseback, and, as the distance was small, she
chose to proceed on foot. The young stranger
then requested her to accept his right arm, while
I supported her with my left, and throwing my
bridle over the other shoulder, we commenced our
march, with Catharine in the centre. As for her
horse, he had not the politeness to await the
result
of his mad frolic, but was by this time, at his
owner's stable in the borough. In this manner
we reached our quarters, where the gallant officer
took his leave.
I must become acquainted with him,
exclaimed
George. Who is he?
He merely informed me that his name was
Webster; and I have learned from others, that he
is a nephew of Noah Webster, esq. the
celebrated
etymologist of New-England. But if the
squadron should not sail to-morrow, you may yet
be introduced to him.
The conversation now turned upon the affairs
of O'Hara, and his unfortunate relatives. The
brave Irishman could hardly command his
feelings
while the subject was spoken of.
You recollect our conversation in Boston?
said O'Hara to George; you then attempted to
convince me that my resentment against Great
Britain was wrong; and, in conformity to your
advice, (which, I have no doubt, was well
intended
)
I have endeavored to soften and suppress it.
What is the consequence? `To whet my almost
blunted purpose,' Heaven found it necessary to
inflict another blow. That cruel blow has now
been struck by the agents of England, and if I
ever forgive her, may Heaven never forgive me!
We shall soon meet them on Lake Erie, and then
my motto shall be
Revenge or Death
. Should
my courage faulter, or my ardor flag, one glance at
our family picture will rekindle both into a blaze
of fury. The shades of a murdered sistera
heart-broken fathera martyred brothershall
pass in succession before my mental view, and
nerve my bosom with a tiger's rage!
Finding him in a humour to chide the thunder,
if at him it grumbled, our hero made no attempts
to restrain the violence of his feelings, by any
arguments
or observations, but sought to change the
subject. When the indignant sailor had given
free vent to the fulness of his heart, he became
more calm, and shortly after took his leave.
The squadron sailed on the following day, and
George was consequently deprived of the
anticipated
introduction to Webster. Early the next
morning the major and his son departed for
Buffalo
,
where they safely arrived on the third day of
their journey.
Major Willoughby spent several days with his
son, which they occupied in visiting the different
military works on the borders of Niagara; George
pointed out to his father the various scenes of
attack
and defence, in the several skirmishes which
had occurred during the obstinate contention for
the possession of this river; explained the
positions
and manuvres of the two vessels which
Elliot surprised under the guns of Fort Erie, and
the operations of the gallant Scott in affording
them protection. George then directed his
father's
attention to the opposite shore, where the
brave Boerstler, King, and Angus, effected their
landing, on the twenty-eighth of November
preceding
,
with a small body of sailors and soldiers.
[23]
[23]
See note to page 115, of this volume.
This intrepid, but unfortunate little party,
continued George, crossed the river under the
impression that the main body of Smyth's army
was to follow, as soon as the enemy's batteries
were carried. They landed, yonder, at about
three o'clock in the morning, under a severe fire
of musketry and grape. Lieutenant Angus
headed
the gallant tars, who were armed with pikes
and cutlasses, and he was assisted by captain
41*
Craig, lieutenant Dudley, midshipman Graham,
and sailing-master Watts; the latter, you
recollect
,
distinguished himself in re-capturing the
Caledonia.
[24]
[24]
See vol. ip. 270.
Samuel Swartwout, esq. of
New-York
,
who happened to be here at the time,
volunteered
his services on that occasion, and
behaved
like a soldier. Sixty regulars and fifty
sailors, composed the whole of the American
force; but bravery supplied the deficiency of
numbers; and, after an obstinate contest, they
succeeded in dispersing the enemy, storming his
works, spiking the cannon, and making about
fifty prisoners.
Every battery between Chippewa and Fort
Erie, was now silent, and the Canadian shore, for
more than fifteen miles, completely open for the
reception of the American army, and yet they
were not permitted to cross!the boats therefore
returned with the wounded and the prisoners,
leaving the victorious King and twelve men, who
would not be persuaded that the army were to be
prohibited from coming over to their support, and
they were consequently made prisoners by the
enemy.
Out of twelve naval officers who were
engaged
in this enterprise, nine of them, with more
than half their brave sailors, were killed or
wounded. Watts fell at the head of his division,
as he was gallantly leading them on. Captain
Dox, who took a distinguished part in this affair,
was severely wounded; as was, also, captains
Morgan and Sproull, and lieutenant Lisson.
Angus
now commands the United States flotilla in
the river Delaware.
My friend Graham, (a brave young
midshipman
,
whose private virtues have secured him the
love of all that know him) was so severely
wounded
in the leg as to render amputation necessary,
which painful operation he endured with the
calmness of a stoic. Indeed, sir, you must excuse
me, if the love and admiration I express for my
amiable friend, amount to enthusiasm; did you
know him as I do, this apology were
unnecessary
.
Who is the father of this brave youth?
Colonel John A. Graham, of the city of
New-York
;
a gentleman well known as a scholar and
a patriot. Some time last winter, the
George
Clinton Society
of New-York, resolved, by a
unanimous vote, to present midshipman John A.
Graham with an elegant SWORD, as a testimony of
their high respect for his gallant conduct on the
occasion I have mentioned; and this resolution
was carried into effect on the fifth of April last.
I will, if you please, read part of a letter on the
subject, which I received from a correspondent
who is a member of that Society, on the day
before
we sailed for Little York. The writer thus
expresses himself:
Monday evening last had been previously
appointed by our Society, for presenting an
elegant
sword to our mutual friend Graham, in honor
of his gallant conduct, on the night of the
twenty-seventh
of November last, in spiking the enemy's
cannon, &c. on the shore opposite Black Rock.
The meeting was, consequently, uncommonly
numerous
,
and honored with the presence of most of
the principal characters in the city. The sword
was accompanied by a complimentary address
from the president, (Osgood) to which our friend
made an appropriate replymodest, but dignified
and patriotic. It was, indeed a most interesting
spectaclea subject worthy the pencil of West.
Figure to yourself the venerable father, with a
youthful son on each side, one of them (supported
on crutches from the loss of a limb in his
country's
service) receiving from the hands of his
fellow-citizens
,
a memorial of their approbation of
his valor. The goddess of Liberty might be very
aptly introduced, decorating with laurels the
brow of her favorite votary. Every person
present
evinced the most lively sentiments of respect
for the young hero, mingled with emotions of pity
for his misfortune. The presence of his patriotic
father, added not a little to the dignity of the
scene. The mingled emotions of patriotism and
paternal pride, were visibly depicted in his
countenance
,
and I could scarcely help exclaiming
aloud
Who would not be a father!
I hope,
my dear Willoughby, to see yourself the hero of
a scene exactly similarwith the exception of
the crutches. Instead of such appendages, be
attended by your heroic father with but one hand;
this would be an excellent substitute in the
picture
,
and equally interesting. Adieu,
D. H. REINS.
On the following day George accompanied his
father to visit the celebrated falls of Niagara.
Thence they proceeded to Lewiston, about nine
miles below, just at the foot of the northern
terrace
,
as those sudden declivities are called which
descend towards Lake Ontario. Some authors
are of opinion that the great fall must, in former
ages, have been at this place, and has since
gradually
worn away the rocky precipice down which
it rushes, until it has travelled eight miles
further
south. A pleasant ride of six miles north of
Lewiston, brought them to the village of
Niagara
,
over which frown the battlements of a
fortress
bearing the same name. The river now
only
separated them from the American
encampment
at Fort George, and the village of Newark,
of which they enjoyed a full view.
This fort (observed George, as they were
viewing the outworks of Niagara) is perhaps one
of the most important military posts in our
country
;
and nothing but cowardice or treachery will
ever change its flag. While we were embarking
at Lewiston to attack Queenston, last October,
the British opened a tremendous fire upon this
place, from the opposite batteries, and continued
to throw red-hot shot into these works for
several
hours. The compliment was, I assure you,
returned with interest, although the garrison here
was, at that time, but a handful of men. Several
houses in Newark were set on fire by our shot,
some of which were entirely consumed. The
south battery (which you perceive is a very
commanding
one) was then commanded by captain
M`Keon, who distinguished himself by his skill
and firmness during the bombardment. The
enemy
,
however, soon commenced throwing shells,
and there being no defences against such
intruders
,
and one of the principal batteries being
nearly destroyed by the bursting of a cannon,
which killed two men, the commandant (captain
Leonard) ordered a retreat. But the garrison had
scarcely left the fort, when the movements of the
enemy indicated an intention to cross the river,
and take possession; upon which the brave
M`Keon immediately returned, with about twenty
men, determined to defend or perish in the fort.
The enemy, however, remained under the
protection
of their own batteries, and the next
morning
the remainder of our garrison rejoined their
undaunted countrymen within the works.
A private belonging to this garrison, named
Doyle, was made a prisoner with the rest of us at
Queenston. His wife had in vain petitioned to have
him paroled, and being incensed at the refusal of
the British, she determined to perform her
husband's
duty against them, the next time these
works should be assailed. An occasion soon
offered
,
for at six o'clock on the morning of the
twenty-first of November following, they
commenced
a bombardment of this fort from five
detached
batteries, two of them mounting
twenty-four
pounders. The garrison here had been
reinforced
,
but was not sufficiently supplied with
artillery
and ammunition. Colonel M`Feely had the
command, and acquired great honor by his
conduct
on the occasion. Our Amazon was as good
as her word, and attended the six-pounder on the
mess-house, yonder, (which was commanded by
Dr. Hooper) with hot shot from the furnace,
regardless
of the shells which were falling around
her, and did not once quit her station during the
whole affair.
In the course of the day the enemy threw two
thousand red hot balls, and one hundred and
eighty shells. Several of those buildings about
the works were fired, but soon extinguished by
the vigilance of the officers and men. Several
houses were also fired on the opposite shore, and
a British schooner was sunk at the wharf. Both
officers and men, on this occasion, acquitted
themselves with honor, but the distinguished
ardor of a few will never be forgotten. I
particularly
allude to colonel M`Feely, colonel Gray,
major Armistead, captains Mulligan, M`Keon, and
Leonard; lieutenants Wendal, Gansevoort,
Harris
,
Thomas, and Reesthe two last of whom
were wounded.
When they had finished their survey, our hero
accompanied his father to their lodgings in the
village, within a few paces of which they passed
an officer walking with a lady. A second look
almost petrified George with astonishmentfor
it was Sophia, supported by the arm of Sandford!
The recognition was mutual, but silent, and
George entered his lodgings deeply ruminating
on so singular an incident.
On the following morning, major Willoughby
took leave of his son, and departed for Albany,
while George crossed the Niagara, entered the
American encampment, and reported himself to
the commandant.
CHAPTER LIV.
THE ENEMY REPULSED.
They yieldthey breakthey fly!
The victory is won!
Behold!they faintthey fallthey die!
O stay!The work is done.
Spirit of Vengeance, rest!
Sweet Mercy cries forbear!
She clasps the vanquish'd to her breast,
Thou wilt not pierce them there!
Montgomery
.
On
our hero's return to camp, he learned that,
during his absence, Chauncey's squadron had
come up the lake, received on board about three
hundred regulars, under the command of Scott,
and then proceeded to Little York, where Scott
landed his men, and captured or destroyed all
the public property and military stores which the
enemy had deposited at that place since its first
capture; they burnt the barracks, and took off all
the sick and wounded prisoners surrendered by
colonel Boerstler, at the battle of Beaver Dams.
[25]
[25]
See p. 132 of this volume.
They then re-embarked, and had returned,
unmolested
,
to Fort George. Chauncey had again
sailed in pursuit of the enemy's squadron.
During the same period, the British had made
a descent on Plattsburgh, a beautiful village,
situate
on the western margin of Lake Champlain,
where they destroyed all the public property and
military stores; but, not content with that, they
had also wantonly burned several
private
ware-houses
,
and carried off an immense quantity of
property belonging to individuals.
Sandford was stationed in Fort Niagara, and
had not yet fleshed his maiden sword. Young
Logan had already distinguished himself in a
successful
attack on a body of Indians who had
approached
the pickets of Fort George. His little
party succeeded in capturing and bringing in
twelve of the British Indians, and several of their
white allies, who were all treated with the
greatest
humanity by their generous captors.
In a few days after our hero's return to the
army, he received the following letter from
O'Hara, whose merits had already been
discerned
by his commodore, and rewarded with an office
of no inconsiderable trust and responsibility on
board the Lawrence. This letter was dated
United States brig Lawrence,
Off Sandusky Bay
,
Aug.
18, 1813.
Dear Sir
,
We arrived at this place on the evening of
the thirteenth instant. By a pilot-boat, which was
sent out for observation, a British sail was
discovered
at anchor near one of the islands, and
the signal for chase was immediately made. By
dark, we were almost within gunshot of the
enemy
;
one hour more of day light, and she would
have been captured. A very severe storm came
on, and for fear of getting the squadron separated,
we anchored for the night. Captain Richardson
has gone on shore to proceed to Harrison's
head-quarters
at Seneca, and accompany the general
down to the fleet. General Clay, the
commandant
at Fort Meigs, has received orders from
Harrison
to reduce the compass of that fort in such a
manner as to enable three hundred men to hold
it, and then march with the balance of his force to
42
head-quarters, at Seneca. Preparations are
accordingly
making to convey the stores,
ammunition
,
and cannon, to Cleveland and Seneca, which
it will take about ten days to accomplish. After
these arrangements are completed, a force of five
thousand troops, regulars and militia, will embark
on board this squadron, and be conveyed to
Malden
,
where Harrison will retrieve all that Hull
lost. Previous to the embarkation, however, you
may expect to hear that we are masters of the
lake.
On the second instant, an affair took place
at the head of this bay, which will immortalize a
youthful hero, who is scarcely out of his teens.
Captain Croghan, who you know has several
times signalized himself in the Northwestern
army
,
(particularly in the successful sortie from
Fort Meigs, in May last) has recently been
promoted
to the rank of major, and appointed to the
command of Fort Stephenson, formerly called
Fort Sandusky, situated on Sandusky river, about
twenty miles from our present anchorage. The
situation of this post was considered by Harrison
to be so defenceless and exposed, that he
directed
Croghan to evacuate it immediately on the
approach of any considerable force of the enemy,
after destroying the public property.
This gallant youth, however, ventured to
disobey his commander, and saw his little
garrison
(of one hundred and sixty men) surrounded
by an immense army of British and Indians, who
had proceeded up the bay in gunboats, under the
command of Proctor and Tecumseh. There was
now no possibility of retreat, even if he had been
so disposed, and Croghan determined to defend
the fort to the last, in which determination he was
supported by every officer and man.
The fort was encircled by a deep ditch, nine
feet in width, which the enemy had to enter
before
he could approach the pickets, through the
heads of which bayonets were driven in a
horizontal
direction.
After directing a tremendous cannonade, for
several hours, against one angle of the fort,
without
producing a breach, the enemy determined to
storm; and a close column of three hundred and
fifty regulars was led on by a colonel Short,
assisted
by lieutenant Gordon, to make an attack on
the bombarded angle.
O for that pen with which Miss Porter
described
the desperate contest on Dumbarton
walls, that I might give you a just idea of this
tremendous assaultthis unparalleled defence.
But as I am not in possession of
her
pen, I will do
the best I can with my own.
The gallant Short advanced in the very face
of death, while his followers were, more than
once, thrown into confusion by the American fire.
But again they rallied, and with accelerated
motion
,
again pushed forward to the attack. In
vain a `leaden hailstorm' beat upon the
advancing
phalanx; in vain the horrid engines of
destruction
vomited death from their iron throats:
like a mighty torrent, the assailants still rushed
onwards, scattering the dead and wounded in
their crimsoned path.
For a moment they paused on the steep brink
of the deep-yawning trench that encircled the
fortress. Leap the ditch! exclaimed the
intrepid
leader of this undaunted column; cut
down the pickets! give no quarter! advance!
Instant, on the word, they poured down the bank
like a mountain cataract, whose sounds are
whispers
to the clashing of their jostling arms. The
ditch was filled, and a bristling row of iron pikes,
fixed in the heads of the pickets, impaled several
of the impetuous assailants. Again the voice of
their leader urges them forward: Scale the
pickets, and show no quarter! Storm!
This order was distinctly heard by the little
Spartan band which those pickets protected.
At this moment, what had appeared to the
assailants
a blank bastion, flanking the ditch,
suddenly
exhibited the blazing throat of ordnance,
from which so tremendous a shower of leaden
slugs and musket balls descended upon the
storming
column, that scarcely a man escaped without
a wound. The ditch ran with blood, and was
piled with mangled heaps of the slain and the
wounded.
Quarter! Quarter! exclaimed the colonel,
who had, a moment before, exhorted his men to
give none; but he called too late. Another
shower
of death swept through his disordered ranks,
and he fellwaving in his hand a symbol of the
mercy he claimed; and by his side fell the
gallant
Gordon. In vain did the surviving officers
without the ditch exert themselves to bring on a
reinforcement; both columns fled in disorder
before
the destructive tempest that pursued them,
and with their redoubtable leaders, Proctor and
Tecumseh, sought for safety in the adjacent
woods.
The din of battle now gradually subsided,
until
no sound was heard by the besieged but the
distant yell of the savage, and the shricks and
groans of the miserable wretches in the ditch;
the latter were sounds which could not fail to melt
with pity the brave hearts of American soldiers.
They were well aware of the fate which the
enemy
had prepared for them, and to which they
must have submitted, had the fortress been
carried
;
but the dreadful situation of the
vanquished
softened the resentment of the victors.
Americans
can
be subdued by the
sufferings
not by
the
prowess
of their enemies. Frequent attempts
were made to afford them assistance from the
walls of the fort; but the humane intention was
as often defeated by their own red allies, who had
been left by their commander, scattered at a
distance
round the fort, to revenge the loss of their
comrades, by chance-shots from the deadly rifle.
Night had now thrown her sable mantle round
the scene of blood, when the groans of anguish,
and cries for water, from dying wretches without
the pickets, grew so loud and distressing, that all
fears of danger or treachery were banished from
the humane bosoms of Croghan and his gallant
associates. The extreme darkness of the night,
and the uncertain position of the enemy,
rendered
it impossible to afford the unhappy sufferers
such succor as their situation required. All that
could be done for their relief, was to furnish them
water to allay the parching fever of death; and
this was let down to them in buckets and bottles.
Thus this little handful of heroes, after being on
severe duty for thirty successive hours, without
refreshment, willingly hazarded their lives to
alleviate
the sufferings of those who had sought, not
only their defeat, but their entire destruction.
On the following day, the enemy decamped
by the way they came, leaving one hundred and
fifty of their number to be interred or cured by
42*
the Americans; besides seventy stand of arms,
several brace of pistols, and a boat, containing
much clothing and military stores. Harrison has
expressed the warmest approbation of Croghan's
conduct, and recommended him to government
for still higher promotion.
The moment you receive any intelligence of
Fleming, fail not to communicate it to me, and to
all others interested in his fate. I wish to hear
that my drooping niece is restored to health and
happinessthe latter, however, cannot be soon
expected.
If we meet the enemy, depend upon it we
shall give a good account of them. A braver
man than Perry never stepped on the
quarter-deck
of a ship; and I will venture to affirm that
every officer and man in the squadron, is as brave
as himself. We will all become meat for the
fresh-water fishes, before we suffer the American
flag to be dishonored. I shall write again as soon
as I have any intelligence to communicate; till
then, adieu.

BRIGHTENING PROSPECTS.
Land of my fathers!resplendant with glory,
Thy genius shall rise o'er the ruin of time;
Immortal thy fame, thou shalt live in the story,
Splendid in peaceand in battle sublime!

Again like a meteor the war-beacon streams;
Deep are the thunders that roll from thy mountains,
Martial the lustre on ocean that gleams.

encampment at Fort George was now
closely invested by a combined army of British
and Indians, under the command of sir George
Prevost, and skirmishes were almost daily taking
place between the pickets of the two armies, of
trifling consequence to either party. But at
day-break
,
on the twenty-fourth of August, the whole
line of American outposts were attacked at the
same instant, and driven in. Captain Vandalsem,
who commanded a small guard on Butler's road,
was surrounded, and cut off from the camp by the
enemy; but instantly rallying his little party, he
forced his way through a superior body, and
brought his guards safely into the garrison. The
enemy continued to advance, and was soon in
possession of the village of Newark, but did not
venture within musket-shot of the American
entrenchments
,
his object being to draw the
Americans
out into the woods. Finding, however, that
they would only act on the defensive against
such superior force, and being now convinced
that their position was much stronger than he
had contemplated, he soon retreated beyond the
reach of the American cannon, and again
retired
to his strong holds. The enemy lost
fifteen killed and several wounded, besides a
captain and ten privates who were made
prisoners
by the gallant captains Davenport and
Delano
.
The loss of the Americans in this affair
was five killed, and about thirty wounded and
missing.
The command of the Northern army had been
recently assigned to general Wilkinson, with
whom the secretary of war was now concerting a
plan of operations to be immediately set on foot
against the enemy's principal towns on the river
St. Lawrence. To make arrangements for
carrying
this plan into execution, the general left
Sacket's Harbor, (at which place the war
department
was now established) and proceeded to Fort
George, where he arrived on the fifth of
September
;
but was prevented by indisposition from
making any immediate preparations for the
contemplated
enterprise.
In the mean time, Chauncey was traversing the
lake in every direction, attempting, in vain, to
decide the question of superiority, by bringing
the enemy's squadron to a general action. But
such a step was not agreeable to their politic
commodore
,
sir James Yeo. The wary knight was
sensible that a definitive contest with Chauncey,
would be virtually playing for the possession of
Upper Canada, and he was not so rash a
gamester
as to risk a stake which was his own already.
He therefore carefully avoided a general
engagement
,
keeping the American squadron continually
in pursuit, and thereby preventing all
co-operation
between the navy and army. By adhering
to this policy he intended to lengthen out an
inactive
campaign, and keep the Americans in check,
until the approach of winter should render their
intended operations abortive.
On the ninth of September Wilkinson formally
assumed the command of Fort George and its
dependencies
,
and only awaited the result of
Chauncey's
movements to commence the execution of
his plan against Kingston and Montreal. A
proposition
was now made to Wilkinson by general
P. B. Porter, general M`Clure, and colonel
Chapin
,
that these three gentlemen should be
permitted
to raise a volunteer force of one thousand men,
exclusive of Indians, and add to it as many of the
militia on duty as would be willing to join them;
that they should be furnished with four pieces of
field artillery, with experienced officers and men
to fight them, and that with this force they should
be authorised to invade the enemy's country.
This proposition was accepted, and these three
patriots immediately commenced the organization
of a volunteer force, with which they were to
maintain the peninsula during the absence of
Wilkinson.
Our hero, with no inconsiderable satisfaction,
now began to anticipate, a scene of activity in
which he would be permitted to participate; and
impatiently looked forward to the day when the
main body of the army was to move from Fort
George on the contemplated enterprise. The
summer had passed away, and no essential
advantage
had been acquired over the enemyno
laurels had been gathered by the armythe
autumn
,
he hoped, would produce a plentiful
harvest
.
While he was banqueting on this hope, he
received the following letter from his father:
Boston
,
September
10, 1813.
My dear Boy
,
The last eastern mail has brought us the
welcome
news of
Another Naval Victory
, the
particulars
of which I will relate as far as they have
been made public, before I descend to local and
domestic subjects.
On the fifth instant, the United States brig
Enterprise sailed from Portsmouth under the
command
of lieutenant Burrows, a young officer who
served in the Mediterranean with honor and
success
,
during our contention with the Barbary
powers. On the next day, which was Sunday,
she fell in with an English brig of equal force,
called the Boxer, commanded by captain Blythe,
who immediately ordered his colors nailed to the
mast, fired a shot as a challenge, and bore down
upon the Enterprise. The action commenced
within half-pistol-shot, and was obstinately
maintained
for about three quarters of an hour, when
the enemy cried for quarter, declaring that their
colors were nailed, and could not be struck.
The gallant Burrows had been mortally
wounded, by a musket ball, at the
commencement
of the battle, but refused to be taken from
the deck, where he continued during the whole of
the action, exhorting his officers to do their duty,
and never suffer the flag to be struck. When the
sword of his brave enemy was presented to him,
he clasped his hands together and exclaimed
I am satisfiedI die contented. He was then
carried below, and shortly after expired. Captain
Blythe, of the Boxer, was also killed, being
struck with a cannon ball. This gallant officer
was one of the pall-bearers at the funeral of the
unfortunate Lawrence, in Halifax.
After the fall of Burrows, the command of
the Enterprise devolved on lieutenant M`Call,
whose cool and determined courage throughout
the action, has received the warmest approbation
of every officer on board. He conducted the prize
into Portland on Monday last, and on the
following
day, the bodies of Burrows and Blythe were
intombed with military honors. Burrows was in
the twenty-eighth year of his age, and has left
two amiable sisters to lament his loss.
The bodies of captain Lawrence, and
lieutenant
Ludlow, arrived at the navy-yard, (in
Charleston, near Boston) on the third instant,
having been brought from Halifax by captain
Crowninshield, of Salem, at his own expense, for
the purpose of bestowing on them funeral honors
in their native country. On captain
Crowninshield's
return to Salem with the bodies of these
heroes, they were publicly interred with every
honor that a grateful town could bestow. In the
mean time, Edward N. Coxe, esq. brother-in-law
of Lawrence, proceeded to Salem for the purpose
of receiving and conveying to New-York, the
remains
of that beloved and universally lamented
hero.
On arriving at the Navy-Yard, the bodies
were placed in covered waggons, and proceeded
by land to New-York. This mode of conveyance
became necessary, in consequence of the refusal
of captain Oliver, who now commands the British
squadron off New-London, (commodore Hardy
having sailed for Halifax) to comply with the
request
made by commodore Decatur, that the
bodies might be permitted to proceed round to
New-York from Salem, in the cartel which brought
them from Halifax. Such refusal was unworthy
a brave enemy, and forms a striking contrast to
the generous magnanimity which has
characterized
our naval commanders during the present
war.
I arrived in this town on the thirtieth ultimo,
after a very pleasant journey. On parting with
you at Niagara, I proceeded to Batavia, where I
tarried that night, and on the night following slept
at Bloomfield, about thirty-six miles further. The
next day at sunset, I crossed Cayuga Ferry, and
took lodgings in the village, which is beautifully
situated on the eastern margin of Cayuga lake.
On taking a survey, the next morning, of the
delightful
scenery which surrounds this lake, I felt
a strong desire to enjoy a sail on its pure and
limpid bosom. This inclination for an aquatic
excursion, was not, I assure you, much diminished
by recollecting that the village of Ithaca was
situated at the southern extremity of this inviting
sheet of water, which is about forty miles in
length, varying from one to four in breadth.
I soon struck a bargain with the owner of a
handsome little pleasure-boat, who agreed to take
me and my baggage to the head of the lake, while
my young Jehu was directed to proceed to Ithaca
with the waggon, along the Aurora turnpike, on
the eastern shore. The wind was fair, and the
day fine. We set sail about eight o'clock, and a
more charming excursion I think I never enjoyed.
The shore of this lake is considerably indented,
and pleasingly irregular; in some places
terminating
in pecipices, but in general about ten or
twelve feet high, with unbroken acclivities that
rise from one to two hundred feet in about half a
mile from the lake. The scenery, on each side,
is beautifully picturesque, and is interspersed with
little thriving villages that give it a very pleasing
effect. I noticed Romulus and Ovid on the west,
and Scipio, Aurora, Levana, and Genoa, on the
east. In the town of Scipio, on the lake shore,
stands the old Cayuga castle, the residence of the
Cayuga Indians. Each of these villages, I was
informed by the boatmen, contain a respectable
academy, and a well selected library, and either
of them must be an eligible situation for the
education
of youth, being far retired from the
fascinations
and luxuries of a city life, and blest with
every charm within the gift of nature.
I discharged my boat, and entered Ithaca
about four o'clock in the afternoon, waited on
Mrs. Woodcock immediately, and found
Catharine
much improved in health. The roses were
again beginning to bloom on her cheek, but are, I
presume, frequently watered from her eyes. Her
whole countenance was lighted with pleasure on
seeing me, and she confessed that she had not,
since the death of her mother, felt so happy as she
did for the two days I tarried in Ithaca.
On taking leave of the hospitable family
under
whose protection Catharine remains, I
proceeded
to Homer, in the county of Cortland;
thence to Sherburne, in Chenango county, and
from thence to Cherry-Valley, in Otsego county.
This village is beautifully situated in the principal
vale of a large township bearing the same name,
and is most romantically environed by high hills.
Almost all the principal roads in the state of
New-York
intersect each other at this village, which
gives it a great amount of trade and opulence.
On leaving Cherry-Valley, I passed through
Sharon
,
Cobelskill, Duanesburg, and Albany. Then
took the great eastern road through Greenbush,
43
New-Lebanon Springs, and entered my native
state in the town of Hancock. I then proceeded
through Pittsfield, Northampton, Worcester and
Cambridge, to Boston, where I arrived in safety,
and found all our friends in good health.
While I was at Ithaca, Mr. Woodcock related
to me a circumstance that deserves recording in
your journal, if you have not already noticed it.
You have doubtless heard Fleming mention a
relative
of his family named O'Fling, who assisted
in establishing our independence, by serving
through the revolutionary war as a
private soldier
,
from motives of patriotism alone. Some time last
January, he repaired to a rendezvous at Batavia,
with
four
of his sons, who all enlisted (together
with their father) as privates in the United States
army, for five years.
This instance of disinterested patriotism, is
not, however, without a parallel. About a month
after the foregoing event, one of the venerable
heroes of Saratoga and his four sons presented
themselves at the rendezvous of lieutenant
Loring
,
in Burlington, (Vt.) for the purpose of
enlisting
under the banners of their country. `I
thought,' says the aged veteran, `that we had
taught Britain a lesson that she would not have
forgotten in my day, but we will show her that a
nation of freemen is irresistible. I was then what
my boys are now, yet am still able to push a
bayonet in defence of my injured country!'
Heath is the name of these worthies. They all
resided in Johnstonthe eldest son is thirty-one,
the youngest nineteen years of age.
Spare no pains to obtain some intelligence of
Fleming. Write often, and believe me to be, as
heretofore, your affectionate father.
E. WILLOUGHBY.
While George was reading the foregoing letter,
a courier arrived at the encampment, with
advices
to Wilkinson of a very important nature,
being no less than accounts of a decisive battle
having been fought on Lake Erie, in which the
Americans were completely victorious, having
captured every vessel belonging to the British
squadron.
As soon as this intelligence was permitted to
transpire, a loud hum of joy ran through the camp,
and heartfelt gratulations were mutually
interchanged
among both officers and men. In two
days afterwards our hero received the following
letter from O'Hara:
Sandusky Bay
,
Sept.
16, 1813.
You was right, my dear Willoughby
Revenge
will not remedy the evil
. British blood
has flowed in torrents, and still I am the last
remaining
twig on our family tree; nor can all the
blood that flows in English veins, resuscitate the
other branches, or restore my lost happiness.
We have had a battle, and hundreds of
Englishmen
are laid lowmany of them beneath the
waters
of Erie. The survivors are our prisoners,
and I have conversed with many of them who
would willingly die for their country, but who
loudly condemn the conduct of those ministers
whose ambition has plunged them into a war
with their brethren. It is the blood of such men,
the blood of our brethren, that has so lavishly
crimsoned the waves of this lake, and their
blood will cry for vengeance on those ambitious
wretches who guide the counsels of England.
You was rightthese men, whom I have been so
eager to destroy, do `commiserate my sufferings,
and denounce the authors of them.' Every
English groan that has saluted my ears since the
battle, has caused me to confess`that was not
the voice which decreed my brother's death; that
man had no hand in dragging me on board a
British ship; he never employed an Indian to
murder my sister; why then should I rejoice at
his
sufferings?' I do not; I am a convert to your
doctrine, and my present tenderness to those poor
wounded men who are placed under my care,
shall in some measure atone for my former error.
On the tenth instant, early in the morning,
while we were lying in Put-in-Bay, a man from
the mast-head cried out
a fleet!
The signal
was immediately made for getting under weigh,
and our squadron then beat out of the bay, to
meet the enemy's, which we perceived consisted
of two ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one
sloop, with their larboard tacks on board,
standing
to the south, under easy sail. The wind was,
at this time, about south-west, and we manuvred
in such a manner as to preserve the weathergage
of the enemy. At ten o'clock the signal was
made for forming in line of battle, when the
Lawrence
led the van, with the schooners Ariel and
Scorpion, on our weather bow. We were
followed
in succession by the Caledonia, Niagara,
Porcupine, Somers, Tigress, and Tripp. The
ship Detroit led the enemy's van, followed by
the Hunter, Queen Charlotte, Lady Prevost,
Chippeway, and Little Belt.
All was now profound silence on board both
squadrons; the wind was light, and we slowly
approached each other in awful majesty.
Suddenly
,
(and unexpectedly to every man in the
squadron except a few officers on board our brig)
a large Union Jack was run up to our mast head,
on which could be distinctly read throughout the
fleet, the dying words of that hero whose name
this vessel bears
Don't give up the ship
.
At sight of it, such a burst of feeling arose from
every bosom, as might almost have been heard
from Erie to Malden.
At about eleven o'clock the exhilirating
notes of a bugle sounded from the enemy's van
ship, which was followed by reiterated huzzas
from the crews of the different vessels in their
squadron.
About noon we had approached within a
mile and a half of each other, when the Detroit,
which mounted long guns, opened a heavy fire
upon the Lawrence, which we were unable to
return, owing to the shortness of ours. Without
waiting for the schooners, which now fell astern,
our commodore kept on his course in such a
gallant
and determined style, that the enemy
supposed
it was our intention to board. Having gained
a nearer position, Perry directed us to return the
enemy's fire; but the length of their guns gave
them greatly the advantage, enabling them to
place a shot just where they pleased, while ours
fell short of them; thus the poor Lawrence was
pierced through and through, with a third of her
crew disabled, before we could make the enemy
feel a single shot.
It now evidently appeared, that the plan of
the British commodore was to destroy this ship,
and thus throw the squadron into confusion. For
that purpose the fire of all his heaviest guns
was directed at the Lawrence alone, leaving our
other vessels unmolested. Signal was now made
for closing with the enemy, but this ship soon
became
so crippled that she was perfectly
unmanageable
,
43*
every brace and bowline being cut
away, and in this situation we sustained the fight
for above two hours, and for a great part of that
time, could only get three or four guns to bear
upon the foe. In the mean time, our men were
rapidly cut down at their quarters, while others
stept into their places, to share the same fate.
The wounded were carried below, but the dead
remained where they fell. Our ship was reduced
to a mere wreck; the decks were streaming with
blood, and covered with mangled limbs and dead
bodies. One gun after another was dismounted,
and the commodore himself assisted to work the
last that could be fired.
Finding, at length, that we could no longer
annoy the enemy from this ship, the gallant
commodore
directed a boat to be lowered from the
stern, and manned; he then ordered his union
jack to be hauled down, which he deliberately
placed under his arm, gave the command of the
Lawrence to lieutenant Yarnell, and sprang into
the boat, directing his men to pull for the Niagara,
which was then hotly engaged. He first,
however
,
called to the pilot, and told him that he
might either accompany him or remain on board
the Lawrence. I will stick by you to the last!
exclaimed the brave fellow, and leaped into the
boat after his commander. Pull away, my brave
boys! exclaimed the hero, gallantly waving his
sword, standing erect in the stern of the boat,
while the balls whistled around him like a shower
of hail. An old sailor, who had been in both
battles of the Constitution, entreated him to be
seated, and finally forcibly pulled him down from
his elevated situation. For a moment the enemy's
fire was diverted from this devoted ship, and
directed against the little bark which we now
watched in breathless anxiety. But in vain were
whole broadsides levelled at itin vain the whole
musketry of two vessels were poured around it
that little bark contained a greater than Csar,
and passed through a shower of shot without
receiving
one on board. In a few minutes we hailed
with transport his inspiring flag hoisted at the
mast-head of the Niagara, and beheld that noble
brig, dash, like a demon of vengeance, through
the enemy's line, raking right and left as she past,
pouring destruction on every side. In the next
moment she was lying yard-arm and yard-arm
with the British commodore. The smaller vessels
followed in order, under the direction of Elliot,
and the contest began to assume a more
promising
aspect.
In the mean time, the Lawrence (having
sustained
the whole fury of the enemy) was wholly
incapable of any further defence, and a show of
resistance was only drawing destruction on the
relics of our mangled crew, many of whom were
killed in the steerage while under the surgeon's
hands. The brave Yarnell, therefore, ordered
our flag to be struck, and our brig hauled out of
the line; but the enemy being now too closely
engaged to take possession of us, our flag was
again hoisted, while the red-cross of England
descended, in succession, on board of every vessel
in the enemy's squadron, except two small ones
who attempted to escape, but were chased and
brought back by two of our small craft.
Thus, by the unparalleled skill and bravery
of Perry, (whom every officer and seaman
acknowledges
to be the saviour, under Heaven, of
the American squadron) we find ourselves in
possession
of the ship Detroit, of twenty guns, large
twenty-four pounders; ship Queen Charlotte, of
nineteen guns; brig Hunter, of ten guns; schooner
Lady Prevost, of twelve guns; schooner
Chippeway
,
of one gun; and the sloop Little Belt, of
two guns. So that the American squadron is
increased
by the addition of six vessels and
sixty-four
guns, while the enemy have not a single gun
afloat on this lake.
The engagement lasted about three hours,
and never was victory more decisive and
complete
.
The captured squadron, you perceive,
exceeds ours in number of guns as well as weight
of metal; their crews were more numerous, and
more prisoners were taken than we had men to
guard them. The loss on both sides is severe;
scarcely a man on board this brig has escaped
unhurt. I have, myself, however, fortunately
come off with a mere scratch in the breast, where
a splinter struck me. On board the Lawrence
there were twenty-two killed and sixty-one
wounded, although thirty-one of our crew were
on the sick list, and unfit for duty. Our total loss
throughout the squadron is twenty-seven killed,
and ninety-six woundeda pretty strong
evidence
that our brig bore the brunt of the action.
The day before the action, there were one
hundred
and sixteen men in the squadron reported
unfit for duty.
I am unable to state the loss of the enemy; it
must, however, have been immense, as several of
their vessels are literally cut to pieces; so much
so, that the masts of the two ships were all carried
away by the board, in a slight gale after the battle,
owing to their being so severely wounded in the
action. Barclay, the British commodore, has done
himself great honor by the gallant manner in
which he fought his squadron. Twice was he
carried below on account of his wounds, and as
often returned again upon deck. Little did I
think, when compelled to fight under this same
brave officer, in the battle of Trafalgar, that I
should ever fight against him. But so it is
There is a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will.
I was also in an engagement with him afterwards,
with a French ship, when he lost his arm. He is
a fine-looking officer, about thirty-six years old,
and has seen much service. A shot from our ship
deprived him of his remaining hand.
The first care of our humane commodore, after
the battle, was to attend to the comfort of the
suffering crews of both squadrons. The sick and
wounded are taken care of in the most tender
manner, and the officers who have fallen on both
sides, were buried last Sunday morning with the
honors of war, on an island in the lake.
The prisoners have been landed at Sandusky,
and Perry has requested Harrison to have them
marched to Chilicothe, until the pleasure of
government respecting them is known. Perry is
now on board the Ariel, and Yarnell has been
directed to take the Lawrence to Erie, with all
the wounded of our fleet, as this ship is so cut up,
that it will not be safe to keep her on the lake
until repaired.
By this time I suppose you are anxious to see
the names of those who have distinguished
themselves
on this occasion. Well, then, attend.
Next to the god-like Perry, (whose exalted merits
are far above the reach of any commendation my
humble pen can bestow) stands the gallant Elliott,
and the greatest praise that can be bestowed on
either of these heroes, is to say, that each of them
was himself
he that is more, is more than man.
When Perry arrived on board of the Niagara,
after leaving his own ship, Elliott discovered
that an important part of the fleet had assumed
improper positions, and immediately
volunteered
his services to pass the whole of the enemy's
line, bring up these vessels, and place them in a
position better calculated to annoy the enemy.
The gallant offer was accepted; and Elliott
passed down the whole line, in a small boat,
while the enemy's fire was so incessant, that his
clothes were wet by the water which was dashed
on him by the balls that fell around his boat. In
this manner he proceeded to our gun-boats, and
ordered them to make sail, and follow him; they
did so, and he placed them under the sterns of
the enemy's two heaviest ships, which placed the
latter between two raking fires, and accelerated
their surrender.
His eye was every where, and he soon
observed
that the guns of the Somers were not well
served nor properly pointed; he therefore went
on board that vessel, and fired the
thirty-two-pounder
three times himself, while Perry had
brought the Niagara into the midst of the
enemy's
line, where she was spouting fire from both
sides at once. These manuvres decided the
contest.
Next to Elliott, I will mention the undaunted
Yarnell, who, though several times wounded,
refused
to quit the deck. The officers, generally,
wore short-jackets, to prevent their being picked
off by the enemy's sharp shooters; and Yarnell
was also dressed as a common sailor. A red
bandanna
handkerchief was tied round his neck, and
another round his head, to stanch two wounds he
had received. From these the blood trickled
down his face, and a splinter having passed
through his nose, it had swelled to a hideous
magnitude
.
In this frightful plight, looking like
the very genius of carnage and ill luck, he came
up to Perry, in the hottest and bloodiest of the
fight, and announced to him that all the officers
of his division were killed. Perry ordered others
in their place. Shortly after, Yarnell returned
with a repetition of the dismal tidings, that all
the officers were shot down: `Then, sir,' said
Perry, `you must endeavor to make out by
yourself
.
I have no more to furnish you.' Perry
escaped unhurt, as did also his brother, a young
midshipman on board the Lawrence.
Webster, as I predicted, `acted well his part,
and there all the honor lies.' He acted as sailing
master on board the Niagara, and in breaking the
enemy's line, no officer ever excelled him. Even
the enemy have extolled the gallant style in which
the Niagara was brought into close action, and the
name of Webster has been publicly commended
by the commodore. The young hero now acts
as lieutenant, and Perry has assured him that the
first mail from Washington will furnish him with
a commission bearing date the tenth of this month.
Thus may bravery ever be rewarded.
The following officers are spoken of as
having
signalized themselves on this brilliant
occasion
:
lieutenants Brooks, Smith, Edwards,
Turner
,
and Packet; midshipmen Forest, Lamb,
Clarke, Claxton, and Swartwout; sailing master
Taylor and Champlin; pursers M`Grath and
Hambleton; and captain Brevoort, of the army,
who acted as a volunteer, in the capacity of a
marine officer, on board the Niagara, and did
great execution with his rifle. Brooks, Lamb,
and Clarke, are fallen, no more to rise.
Hambleton
,
who volunteered his services on deck,
was severely wounded, late in the action.
Claxton
and Swartwout are also badly wounded.
So much for officersbut heroism is not
always
distinguished by an epaulet. A seaman
named Hall, in one of the gun-boats, observing
the last remaining sponge fall overboard, without
which the long gun would have been useless,
plunged into the waves and caught ithis
comrades
seized the end of the sponge and drew him
on board, and then again poured away into the
enemy.
James Bird, son of J. Bird, of Exeter, in
the state of New-Hampshire, was on board the
Lawrence, and did his duty like a hero. His
comrades fell thick around him, but he stood at
his post firm and undismayed. At length a
canister
shot struck him on the shoulder, as he was
stooping to his gun, and he was instantly covered
with blood. His officer ordered him below, but
he ventured to disobey, preferring to do his duty
while he had life, to abandoning his post. The
blood flowed so fast, that another order was issued
to go below; when he ran down, got a hasty
bandage on the wound, and returned again upon
deck. Although his left arm was now useless,
yet he handed cartridges, and performed every
service in his power, with his right, until the stars
and stripes waved gloriously over the foe.
Two Indian Chiefs had been stationed in the
tops of the Detroit, to pick off our officers with
their rifles. No sooner, however, did the ships
come into close action, than they were dismayed
by this new and tremendous species of battle,
and slunk into the hold. When the ship was
taken, they anticipated cruel treatment, if their
nation was discovered, and therefore borrowed
sailors' clothes, that they might pass for
Englishmen
.
Thus disguised, they lay in close
concealment
for two days, when word was brought to
Perry, that two Indians were concealed below,
who had not tasted food for eight-and-forty hours.
He had them brought up on deck, where they
made a most uncouth and ludicrous appearance,
with their borrowed garments bagging about
them. They expected nothing less than to be
butchered and scalped; but, notwithstanding,
preserved the most taciturn inflexibility of muscle.
Perry, however, after putting a few good
humoured
questions to them, ordered them to be taken
away and fed; a degree of lenity which seemed
to strike them with more surprise than their stoic
natures are apt to evince.
Our surgeon relates an anecdote which may
serve to show the cool intrepidity of our seamen,
and their propensity to extract amusement from
the most frivolous incidenteven amid the
horrors
of a sanguinary battle. That part of the
Lawrence which was appropriated for the
purpose
of a cockpit, was exposed to the enemy's
shot, and there the wounded and dying lay strewn
about in such numbers, that the feet of the surgeon
sank in blood and gore, which had acquired the
consistency of mud. We had a dog on board, and
confined him to this place during the action, that
44
he might not be in the way on deck. At every
new discharge of the enemy's guns, he howled
most pitiously for mercy; but as soon as a partial
silence succeeded, he would growl and bark
defiance
at the enemy. A shot at length opened
day-light
on that scene of gloom and horror, when the
dog immediately thrust his head through the
shot-hole
and howled for quarters. The strange
conduct
of this terrified animal, the surgeon assures
me, so diverted the wounded and dying, that they
burst into loud and intemperate peals of laughter.
Your relation, Mr. Latamore, of Erie, is now
on board this vessel; he sets out on his return
home to-morrow, and has promised to forward
this letter to you with all convenient haste. We
proceed for the same place immediately, but as
the wind is ahead, he will
outsail
us on horseback.
He informs me that young Croghan has been
rewarded
for his gallantry at Fort Sandusky, in the
best possible way that a young hero could wish
to be rewardedby the fair. The ladies of
Chilicothe, it appears, have presented him an
elegant sword, as a testimony of their respect for
his bravery and patriotism; and government has
promoted him to the rank of colonel. Adieu.
WILLIAM O'HARA.
CHAPTER LVI.
THE FORAGING PARTY.
O Woman! Woman! Woman! All the Gods
Have not such power of doing good to man,
As you of doing harm!
Dryden's All for Love
.
Among
the few noble spirits to whom our hero
had become strongly attached during his service
on the peninsula, was an officer named Cummins,
who had several times rendered himself
conspicuous
for his heroism and military skill,
[26]
[26]
Particularly on the 17th of July and 17th of August, 1819.
and who
was at once admired for his bravery, respected
for his talents, and beloved for his virtues. His
morals were exemplary, his deportment dignified,
and his address insinuating. Although lieutenant
Willoughby was a general favorite in the army,
yet he had but few
friends
and Cummins was
one of the chosen few.
Affairs between pickets, of greater or lesser
magnitude, were daily occurring, and foreging
could only be accomplished within the limits of
the enemy's line, and at the hazard of continual
contests; for the force which invested Fort
George, was at this time greatly superior to that
of its defenders.
In one of these foraging excursions, our hero
and his friend Cummins, being closely engaged
in an interesting conversation, imperceptibly
drew off from their party into the woods, and
suddenly
found themselves near a farm-house, before
they were fully aware of their aberration. No
enemy was in view, and as our adventurers were
well armed, they were determined to dismount,
and, if possible, obtain some refreshment in the
cottage. Having fastened their horses to a tree,
and carefully reconnoitred the passes which led
from the house, they advanced to the door, and
knocked for admittance; but no one appearing
to answer the summons, they lifted the latch, and
entered the rustic mansion
sans ceremonie
.
They now found themselves in a narrow hall,
at the farther extremity of which was a flight of
stairs to the garret, and on either hand a door
opening into a ground apartment. They entered
first one and then the other of these doors,
without
discovering a human being; but as they were
about leaving the second, a low murmur of voices
saluted their ears from a room beyond; and what
they had at first taken for a curtained window,
they now conjectured to be a sash-door leading
to the apartment which contained the speakers.
Be on your guard, whispered Cummins, as
they softly approached the door; there may be
too many for us.
George made no reply, but advanced to the
door, and applied his ear to the key-hole to listen.
Several different voices could be distinguished,
but in so low a key, that the subject of their
conversation
could not be gathered. He thought,
however, that the tone of one, (who mentioned
the words
Niagara, De Rottenberg
,
[27]
[27]
A general officer in the British army which invested Fort George.
Kingston
and some others, loud enough to be understood
by the listener) were familiar to his ear. While
George was thus engaged, his friend gently
removed
one corner of the curtain, and obtained a
distinct view of the room and the party within it.
He immediately touched our hero on the arm, and
drew him gently from the door.
There is treason hatching, whispered
Cummins
.
A dozen British officers are tampering
with a deserter.
British officers!
Yesin disguise; but the laced collar of one
of them is visible above his cloak, and I presume
that they are all of a kidney. Our
cue
is, to
retreat
.
How know you that they have a deserter with
them? asked George, in a whisper, as they
cautiously proceeded towards the hall.
I saw him, returned Cummins, and knew
him instantly. It is your truant servant boy,
whose sudden and extraordinary disappearance
has excited so much surprise.
Who!
Reuben.
Impossible! replied George. I must have
a peep, if it costs my life.
It is rashness to venture, whispered
Cummins
.
Let us retreat while it is in our power.
I feel no disposition, just at this time, to be
introduced
to the magnanimous gentlemen within.
George was alike deaf to the advice of his
friend, and to the suggestions of prudence. His
curiosity was inflamed, and had there been no
other way of gratifying it, he would have pounced
into the room and trusted to fortune for the rest.
Fortunately, however, he gained a rapid survey
of the groupe, without being detected. A youth
was standing with his back towards the door,
holding a folded paper in his hand, and earnestly
addressing several gentlemen, whose persons
44*
were enveloped in cloaks or great coats. The
manner of the speaker was earnest and his
gestures
animated, while he gracefully turned to the
right and left as if appealing to his auditors for
the correctness of his sentiments. Suddenly he
ceased, and after delivering the folded paper, so
changed his position as to afford our hero a full
view of his face. It was Sophia, in the
character
of Reuben.
George continued in this perilous situation so
long, that Cummins became seriously alarmed,
and returned to urge his departure. Completely
absorbed in wonder, he suffered himself to be led
to the hall in silence. The moment they entered
it, a hard featured middle-aged man was
descending
the stairs, and he started with unaffected
surprise
on thus unexpectedly encountering the
livery of his enemy. After a moment's hesitation,
he edged towards the door from which our
adventurers
had just issued, who suspecting his
intention
was to betray them, darted before him, and
presenting their pistols at his breast, assured him
that an audible breath should be his last.
The sturdy Englishman was not, however, to
be thus intimidated; he dashed the pistols from
him, right and leftbroke through his opponents
with the strength of a giant, and flew towards the
interior apartment, calling loudly for assistance.
The alarm being given, no time was to be lost.
Our adventurers were on horseback in a moment;
and, after discharging their pistols in the faces of
the enemy, set off on a full gallop through the
woods, and soon rejoined their comrades in a field
beyond. The waggons were now loaded with
forage, and the party returned to camp
unmolested
.
But, the mysterious Reubenwhat could be
the object of his interview with British officers,
and what could that folded paper contain? Was
there a treasonable plot on foot?Could
Sandford
be concerned in it?How was the
circumstance
to be reconciled with the well-known
vigilance
of the American pickets? What was the
extent of the plot?How many might be
concerned
in it?How could it be circumvented?
These, and a thousand other similar questions,
passed in rapid succession through the mind of
our hero, as he accompanied the party to camp;
but he could form no satisfactory conclusion on
the subject. For several days he thought of
nothing else, and the subject might have occupied
his mind for months, had not the busy
arrangements
which were now making for an important
enterprise, diverted his attention to other objects.
The health of Wilkinson being now partially
restored, the most active preparations were on
foot for the execution of his projected expedition
against Montreal. Grenadier Island, a point
between
Sacket's Harbor and Kingston, had been
determined upon as the most eligible place for a
rendezvous, to collect and concentrate the
different
regiments, previous to embarking them in the
batteaux which were to convey them down the
St. Lawrence. For this place, therefore, the
general embarked on the second day of October,
with the main body of the northern army;
leaving
a small garrison of regulars and militia to
occupy
Fort George and its dependencies, under
the command of Scott, who had directions to
march them to Sacket's Harbor, and there unite
with the grand expedition, as soon as general
M`Clure should arrive with his volunteers to
relieve
him on the peninsula.
In the mean time, the British army under De
Rottenberg retained its position, about four miles
from Fort George, and Scott had every reason to
apprehend an attack, as soon as the departure of
Wilkinson was known to the enemy. He
therefore
made the greatest exertions to strengthen his
defences, which were very incomplete at the time
he was left in command.
Instead of attacking him, however, the enemy
suddenly broke up their encampment, burnt and
destroyed all their camp equipage and many
stand of arms, in order to facilitate their
movements
towards Kingston, which was suspected to
be the first object of Wilkinson's expedition.
Scott's position was now perfectly safe, and his
duties consequently extremely light; but indolent
safety and inglorious ease, were not the objects
of his ambition. He was impatient to be relieved
at this post, that he might fly after Wilkinson and
share the dangers and glory which awaited the
American arms on the St. Lawrence.
In a few days his wishes were gratified. The
volunteers which had been raised by the patriotic
M`Clure, Porter, and Chapin, arrived at the
garrison
;
and, agreeably to his instructions, Scott
resigned his command to the former of these
heroes, and pressed forward with his brave
followers
by forced marches, towards Sacket's
Harbor
.
In the army which Wilkinson was
concentrating
for this expedition, the gallant Brown, (now a
brigadier in the regular service) held an
important
commandas did, also, the intrepid Boyd;
the former being appointed to lead the van, and the
latter to command the rear guard. The
ever-daring
Scott, the heroic Covington, and the brave
Swartwout, were to command their respective
brigades. Colonels Brearly, Porter, M`Comb,
and Preston, had proved themselves heroes on
the Niagara, and were now ready to confirm
their claim to the title on the St. Lawrence.
Pearce, who, after the fall of Pike, at Little York,
led on the Americans to victory and glory, was
now impatiently waiting to be led by Wilkinson
through the same perilous path to the same
glittering
goal. Forsyth was early at the
rendezvous
,
with his valiant corps of riflemen, who were
eager, once more, to exercise their well-tried
arms against the enemythose arms which had
been so successfully wielded at Gananoque,
Ogdensburg
,
Elizabethtown, Little York, and Fort
George. Cummins, Willoughby, Smith,
Whiting
,
Worth, and many other officers of
distinguished
merit, whose names shall be recorded in
another chapter, were also engaged in this
expedition
.
The whole army consisted of about eight
thousand men, and was to move under the
immediate
direction of Wilkinson, assisted by
major-general
Lewis.
On the twenty-fifth day of October, the troops
at Grenadier Island began to embark in boats
prepared for the purpose; and although the
autumnal storms were now raging with great
violence
on the lake, their gallant leader determined
to delay the enterprise no longer. Disease and
pain still hung about him, but the energy of his
mind rose superior to bodily infirmity, and he
superintended the embarkation most of the time,
exposed to the cold searching winds and
drenching
rains. As the boats were filled, he bade them
take advantage of the first momentary pause in
the storm to slide into the St. Lawrence, and
gain the next appointed rendezvous, which was a
place called French Creek.
On the day before the embarkation was
completed
,
colonel Randolph arrived at Grenadier
Island with two hundred and thirty men. As
Scott had not yet reached Sacket's Harbor with
his column, orders were left for him to proceed on
by land through Brownsville
[28]
[28]
This village was first settled by the enterprise and exertions of
general Brown, from whom it takes its name. See vol. i, page 39.
and Oxbow, to
Ogdensburg
,
and there join the army as it passed
down the St. Lawrence. The van, under Brown,
had already entered that majestic river, and the
commander in chief was hastening the departure
of the remaining brigades, whom he intended to
follow in his gig, accompanied by his passage
boat with his staff.
By the arrival of Randolph, our hero was
furnished
with a letter from O'Hara, which the
reader will find recorded in the next chapter.
CHAPTER LVII.
MICHIGAN RESTORED.
O'ershadowing laurels deck
The living hero's brows;
But lovelier wreaths entwine his neck,
His children and his spouse!
Exulting o'er his lot,
The dangers he has braved;
He clasps the dear ones, hails the cot,
Which his own valor saved.
Montgomery
.
Erie, Pa.
October
20, 1813.
Good news, my dear Willoughby! Detroit,
Sandwich, Maldenall that Hull and you lost,
and all that you might have takenis now in
possession
of the Americans. Tecumseh is slain,
Proctor fled, and the British army captured, with
all their camp equipage and their leader's private
baggage. Harrison is the hero who has achieved
all this, by the valor of the brave troops under his
command. I have just conversed with an officer
who served as a volunteer in this brilliant affair,
and he has furnished me with the following
particulars
:
As soon as Harrison was informed of our
victory
on the lake, he concentrated his whole army
at the mouth of Portage river, near Sandusky Bay,
at which place he was joined, on Friday, the
seventeenth of September, by the venerable
governor
of Kentucky (his excellency Isaac Shelby)
with four thousand well mounted volunteers. This
grey-headed veteran, now upwards of sixty-years
old, volunteered to serve under Harrison during
his intended expedition to Malden. Harrison
gratefully accepted the patriotic proposal, and
requested him to retain the command of his own
volunteers which should constitute the right wing
of the invading army. The works at Fort Meigs
being now reduced (as mentioned in my letter
dated the eighteenth of August) general M`Arthur
marched from that post with his brigade, and
joined
the main body also.
On Tuesday, the twenty-first ultimo, the army
began to embark on board the squadron, and in
the course of the week were all transported to a
cluster of islands within twelve miles of Malden;
where, on the Monday following, they were again
received by the American flotilla, consisting of
sixteen vessels of war and upwards of one
hundred
boats. In the afternoon of the same day the
troops were all landed in good order, on the
enemy's
shore, three miles below Malden. Colonel
R. M. Johnson, (who had signalized himself
during
the siege of Fort Meigs) had been previously
ordered to proceed with his regiment to Detroit
by land, where he arrived on Wednesday, the
twenty-ninth.
As soon as general Proctor was informed of
the approach of the American army, an event
which he expected after the battle on the lake, he
prepared to abandon Maldenand accordingly,
set fire to the fort, destroyed all the public
property
,
and retreated with his army along the
banks of the Thames, towards the interior of
Upper
Canada, accompanied by Tecumseh, with his
red forces. The ruins of the fort, barracks, and
other public buildings, were still smoking when
the American army entered Malden, and a
number
of females came out to meet the general as he
approached the town, and implored his
protection
.
It was not Cockburn to whom they thus
appealed. The violated females of Hampton
passed in rapid review through the hero's mind,
and he exclaimedYes, fair suppliants, I will
protect you with my life; instant death shall be
his fate who presumes to treat one of you with
disrespect. I have come to conquernot to
oppress
;
to disarm assassinsnot to assail the
peaceful. You may rely upon our protection.
Thus having secured the hearts of the ladies, the
men were easily prevailed upon to receive their
new masters. The inhabitants received every
indulgence that could be granted or wished.
The next day the Americans proceeded to
Sandwich, crossed the river, and entered Detroit,
which had been left by the British in possession
of the Indians, who now fled with the greatest
precipitation
.
Here they were received by the
distressed
inhabitants with the most rapturous
acclamations
of joy, and Harrison was hailed by them
as the angel of their deliverance. They had been
subjected to the caprice of tyrants of the worst
kind; their property had been at the disposal of
the British and Indians, and a word, or even a
look, would sometimes forfeit it. The bare
mention
of a rumor unfavorable to the British cause,
or the slightest interference in favor of their
unfortunate
countrymen in captivity, subjected them
to imprisonment in the guard-house or the
dungeon
to
banishment from their homes, or to
severities
of even a worse nature. No wonder,
then, that when the American troops landed, they
hailed them as their deliverers.
M`Arthur's brigade first crossed the river,
and there were, at that time, about six hundred
Indians encamped at the back of the town,
employed
in cooking victuals and jerking beef, all of
45
which they left in their haste to escape, and thus
the Americans were furnished with a supply of
provisions that lasted several days.
Colonel Johnson having now arrived with
his regiment, Harrison determined to pursue the
retreating enemy up the river Thames;
notwithstanding
he was then four days' march in
advance
.
He accordingly directed M`Arthur to
occupy Detroit with his brigade, and on Saturday,
the second of October, commenced the pursuit,
and marched thirty miles before he halted. The
patriotic Shelby led on his own brave mounted
volunteers; and the gallant Desha headed a
brigade
of infantry. Colonel Ball and major Wood,
who had both been promoted for their bravery in
the defence of Fort Meigs, were also engaged in
the present pursuit. Supported by such men,
could Harrison do less than conquer? But these
were not all. Perry, the hero of Erie, volunteered
his services as aid to the commander in chief, and
so did general Cass, who was once a colonel in
Hull's army. John Speed Smith and John
Chambers, esquires, also volunteered their
services
for the same purpose. Captain Todd and
lieutenant O'Fallon were the general's regular
aids-de-camp.
On Tuesday, the fifth, after some successful
skirmishes with the savages, who opposed their
advance, the eager Americans overtook their
retreating
enemy, whose progress had been retarded
by the baggage of their chief, who was so
over-loaded
with plunder that his carriage proceeded
very heavily along. Finding himself reduced to the
alternative of yielding or fighting, Proctor chose
the latter, as thereby he might possibly preserve
his pilfered booty, or at least save his own dear
person from captivity. For after his treatment
of the Americans in his power, he felt that he had
no right to expect mercy from them, should the
scale be turned against him.
He was now about four miles ahead of
Harrison
,
and had made a stand, in a very
advantageous
position, on an open field, approachable only
by a narrow plain between the river and a swamp.
Notwithstanding the fatigue which his army had
endured in forced marches, Harrison
determined
to make an immediate attack. Knowing that
the American
back-woods-men
ride better in the
woods than any other peoplethat a rifle or
musket
is no impediment to them, and that they can
fire as accurately on horseback as on foot, he
determined
to assail the enemy in a manner entirely
new, and, of course, to them entirely unexpected.
Having, therefore, arranged the mounted infantry
in suitable columns for making a
galloping
charge,
he ordered them to advance, receive the enemy's
fire, and then break his line, while the foot were
to follow, and support them in the conflict.
As they emerged from the wood, in front of
the British line, a general discharge of musketry
assailed them, which caused many of the horses
to recoil, and a temporary disorder was produced.
Another fire was received, and the noble animals
gained confidence, were soon put in motion, and
in a few moments the British line was pierced by
upwards of one thousand horsemen, armed with
muskets, who dashed through with irresistible
speed, striking down or trampling under foot all
opponents; and having killed and wounded
upwards
of fifty in the charge, instantly formed in
the rear, wheeled to the
right about
, and renewed
the attack. Such a panic did this novel mode of
modern warfare strike into the astonished
Englishmen
,
that all resistance was abandoned, and
four hundred and seventy-two soldiers threw
down their arms, and surrendered themselves
prisoners of war, together with three colonels and
two majors.
Proctor instantly perceived that the day was
lost; and (trembling for the fate which his
barbarities
merited) thought only of effecting his own
escape and the preservation of his private
baggage
.
He therefore left his followers to their
fate, and fled in his carriage, under a strong
escort
of dragoons.
Not so Tecumseh, who headed about twelve
hundred Indians on the left. His line had been
assailed in a similar mode, by two columns under
colonel Johnson, and still remained unbroken.
He disdained to fly or yield like his trembling
allies, and having posted his warriors in the best
possible positions to repulse an attack, firmly
maintained his ground. Johnson then ordered
his columns to dismount, and charge on foot, when
a most desperate and sanguinary conflict took
place; Tecumsch's line was broken, and his
undaunted
band were charged front and rear. The
Indians, however, were not dismayed, but quickly
collecting their principal strength upon the right,
they made an attempt to penetrate the line of
infantry under the gallant Desha. At that
moment
the venerable Shelby pressed forward with
a regiment to the support of his friend, and the
Indians were compelled to fall back.
Meanwhile, Johnson was in the hottest of the
fight, and his blood was gushing from him in five
different streams, dying with a crimson hue the
milk-white charger on which he was mounted.
Covered with blood, and faint with pain and
fatigue, he now encountered the redoubtable
Teeumseh
,
arm to arm.
Then came the tug of war.
The moment the savages beheld their chief
thus engaged, a shower of bullets was poured
upon his assailant, piercing his coat, hat, and
accoutrements
,
without, however, injuring his
person
.
Tecumseh levelled his rifle and firedhis
aim was unerring, but as he pulled the trigger his
opponent's horse plunged, and the ball whistled
harmless by him. The desperate warrior now
sprang forward with his tomahawkhis eye
flashed fire, and he seemed to increase in stature,
as he raised his arm, to throw the deadly weapon,
collecting all his energy into one dreadful effort.
At that moment his brave opponent's horse
received
a wound, and staggered back, while his
rider drew a pistol and shot Tecumseh through
the head. The victor fainted in the act, and both
fell together, mingling their streaming blood on
the ground.
But the wounds of the victorious colonel were
not mortal; he was speedily removed from the
scene of slaughter, while major Thompson
assumed
the command of his column, and the
battle
continued to rage for nearly an hour, when
the savages were put to flight, and the Americans
remained masters of the field. Harrison, who had
been in every part of the action, now gave orders
for the wounded of both armies to receive every
humane attention that situation and circumstances
would permit.
45*
When Proctor fled from the field of battle, he
was closely pursued by a squadron of horse; but
his superior knowledge of the country, and the
speed of his horses, enabled him to effect his
escape. His baggage, however, which was very
valuable, and all his private papers, fell into the
hands of his pursuers, and were brought to
Harrison
,
after the battle.
Among the trophies of this brilliant victory,
were six pieces of brass artillery, three of which
were the same pieces which Dearborn assisted in
taking from Burgoyne, at Saratoga, during the
revolutionary war, and which were surrendered
by Hull at Detroit, at the commencement of the
present. Harrison has also taken two iron
twenty-four
pounders, and upwards of five thousand
stand of small arms. The enemy had no
standard
in the field, or it would also have been taken.
Many officers distinguished themselves in
this battle. Colonel R. M. Johnson, I have
already
mentioned. Cass and Perry were at every
point where they could be useful. Shelby
exhibited
all the vigor of youth, the same ardent zeal
which distinguished him in the revolutionary war,
and the same undaunted bravery which he
manifested
at King's Mountain. Though the
governor
of an independent state, yet for the good of
his country, he voluntarily placed himself under
the command of an officer far his junior in years,
and was not more remarkable for his courage,
zeal, and activity, than for the promptitude and
cheerfulness with which he obeyed his general's
orders. Major-generals Desha and Henry, and
brigadiers Allen, Caldwell, King, Chiles, and
Trotter, all of the Kentucky volunteers, covered
themselves with laurels. General Adaip and
lieutenant-colonel
James Johnson, rendered
themselves
conspicuous by their bravery and skill;
as did, also, colonels M`Dowell, and Walker, of
Shelby's staff. Major Wood and previously
distinguished
himself at Fort Meigs, and on this
occasion
he added new laurels to his brow. Majors
Barry, Crittenden, Payne, and Thompson, were
both zealous and active in the discharge of every
hazardous duty assigned them; while captain
Butler, captain Todd, and lieutenant O'Fallon
were equally emulous in the discharge of theirs.
Harrison has expressed his warmest approbation
of the conduct of Smith and Chambers, the two
gentlemen who volunteered as his aids. In short,
sir, every man did his duty, and every man is
entitled
to a share of the glory which was on that
day so brilliantly shed on the American arms.
The fifth of October should hereafter be kept by
Americans as a festival.
When my informant left Malden, Harrison
was about to embark for Buffalo, with all his
disposable
force, and you may expect him at Fort
George by the first of November. Adieu.
WILLIAM O'HARA.
The pleasure which our hero derived from the
contents of the foregoing letter, was not in the
least diminished by the perusal of another,
handed
him also by colonel Randolph. This last was
from the secretary of war, (then at Sacket's
Harbor
)
and enclosed a captain's commission, to
which rank lieutenant Willoughby had been
previously
brevetted, for his good conduct and
conspicuous
gallantry on the twenty-fourth of August,
when the encampment at Fort George was
attacked
by the whole British army.
CHAPTER LVIII.
THE GRAND EXPEDITION.
Once more they glitter in refulgent arms,
Once more the fields are filled with dire alarms.
Pope's Homer
.
When
De Rottenberg withdrew so suddenly
from the peninsula, he led his army by forced
marches to Kingston, under the impression that
Wilkinson's movements were directed against
that place. To keep this impression alive, and
thereby confine the enemy's operations to the
protection of that place only, Wilkinson chose
French Creek for his next rendezvous, as being
directly opposite the point at which the British
might reasonably suppose he would land. The
van of the army, under Brown, had already
reached
this rendezvous, after a very boisterous
passage
from Grenadier Island, during which many of
the boats were driven on shore, and much
provisions
and clothing lost.
The vigilant enemy had observed this
movement
,
and determined, while the army was thus
divided, to attack the van. They accordingly
approached French Creek, on Monday, the first
day of November, with a squadron of two brigs,
two schooners, and a number of boats loaded with
infantry; and, about sunset, commenced a furious
attack on Brown's detachment. Such, however,
was the judicious arrangement and heroic
conduct
of that leader, assisted by the artillery of
M'Pherson and Fanning, that the assailants were
compelled to retire; and, on renewing the attack
the next morning, were completely repulsed. In
a few hours afterwards Chauncey's squadron
entered
the St. Lawrence, and took a position to
command the north and south channels, so that
during the following day, the rear of the army
reached the general rendezvous in safety. But
the commander in chief was now so severely
indisposed
,
that he was obliged to be carried on
shore, and lodged in a tent; while the further
advance of the army was suspended for
four-and-twenty
hours, in order to effect the necessary
arrangements
.
On Friday morning they again moved forward.
The storm had subsided, the river was placid,
the day delightful, and the health of the general
improved. More than three hundred boats,
crowded with troops, and arranged in martial
order, moved gracefully down the stream,
propelled
along by the current and a gentle breeze.
They proceeded unmolested, although their
motions
were closely watched by the enemy during
the whole day. The sun was setting as the rear
of the flotilla passed Elizabethtown, an English
village in the county of Leeds, on the left bank of
the river. Our hero's attention was directed to
the spot by Cummins.
We are now, observed the latter,
opposite
the scene of Forsyth's successful gallantry;
the field where he plucked the first sprig of those
laurels with which he has since so profusely
decked
his brows.
You allude to his affair at Gananoque?
[29]
[29]
See note to page 44 of this volume.
Not to that alone, replied Cummins. About
four months after that affair, he honored
Elizabethtown
with a similar visit, (which is situated in
the same county.)It was on the sixth of
February
last, previous to his promotion, while he was
commandant at OgdensburgBrown being in
winter-quarters with his family. He left
Ogdensburgh
with about two hundred volunteers, part
from his own company, part from captain Lydle's
volunteers, and the remainder citizens, among
whom was colonel Benedict, besides several other
gentlemen of distinction. The detachment
proceeded
in sleighs up the river to Morristown,
here on our right, where they formed, and at
three o'clock in the morning crossed over to
Elizabethtown
,
surprised the guard, took fifty-two
prisoners, among whom were major Carley, three
captains and two lieutenants; also one hundred
and twenty muskets, twenty rifles, two casks fixed
ammunition, &c. but no private property was
either taken or destroyed. All was effected
without
the loss of a single man.
I now recollect the circumstance, answered
George. He was led to the measure in
retaliation
of the repeated aggressions of the British,
who had been in the habit of crossing the river
and taking deserters, sixteen of whom they had
confined in the jail at Elizabethtown, whom they
threatened to shoot. Forsyth succeeded in
liberating
them.
And that part of his success I lament,
rejoined
Cummins.
Why so?
Because, so long as wars are necessary, the
crimes of desertion and treachery
must
be
capitally
punished; and did belligerents refuse
countenance
to such crimes in their enemies, they would
soon cease to exist.
I have long been of the same opinion,
replied
Willoughby; and have frequently wished
that it were established as a law of nations, to
profit by the treachery, but to hang the traitor.
The remedy may seem to be the greater evil;
but, be assured, it would soon work its own
cure.
There can be no doubt of it, answered
Cummins
;
and had this been the case, you would,
before this time, have heard that your boy
Reuben
had danced in the air.
Our hero was visibly embarrassed; but, after
a moment's hesitation repliedNo, sir; had
such been the law of nations, Reuben had never
deserted; for then it would have been to seek
certain destruction.
And De Rottenberg would still have
remained
idle on the peninsula, instead of hanging here
on our rear.
Perhaps not idle, returned George. If
your conjectures are correct, and he really
learned
our destination from Reuben, that lad's
treachery may have been instrumental in saving
Fort George; for De Rottenberg would
certainly
have attacked Scott after our departure, had
not his attention been drawn another way. But,
understand mewhatever good may result from
intended evil, it does not in the least tend to
palliate the crime of the perpetrator.
Whatever good may have been produced on
the peninsula, observed Cummins, it is, I
think, pretty evident, that it will not extend to the
St. Lawrence; and I shall not be surprised if we
meet both De Rottenberg and Prevost at
Montreal
.
Then let us meet them, answered George.
But recollect, my friend, that we are first to
meet Hampton, with all his army; and it will go
hard, indeed, if our united forces are not a match
for theirs.
Where is this junction to take place? asked
Cummins.
That is more than we subordinates can
pretend
to know. But, being by birth a yankee, I
have a right to
guess
.
Well, as you
guess
.
At the mouth of the Chataugay river, which
empties into the St. Lawrence not many miles
this side of Montreal: for so Hampton's recent
movements certainly indicate.
His troops I understand are generally raw
and undisciplined, observed Cummins.
Yesbut they are commanded by officers of
tried and approved courage and talents. Besides
Izard, he has colonel Clark, who, for partizan
warfare, is another Forsyth. Then there is
Snelling
,
whose metal was tried on the banks of
the Wabash, and at Maguaga; Wool, who
distinguished
himself at Queenston; King, the
hero
of Black Rock, who was also conspicuous for
his bravery at Little York; Purdy, Parker, Finch,
Hamilton, Nash, and many others whom I cannot
at present recollect.
During this conversation, the shades of evening
had fell upon the surrounding landscapes; the
moon (now nearly at her full) slowly ascended,
like a silver target, in their front; and the cold
breath of expiring autumn sighed sadly as it
passed
.
The American village of Morrisville had
just faded from their view in the rear, when the
preconcerted signal-gun was heard from the van,
and the flotilla approached the American shore,
where the troops landed and encamped for the
night.
On the following morning, the commander in
chief had so far surmounted his malady, as to
advance
down the river in his gig, to reconnoitre;
and, on his return, ordered every man to be
landed
,
(except a sufficient number to navigate the
boats) and on the approach of evening to
commence
their march by land, in order that they
might pass the batteries at Prescott under cover
of the night. The flotilla were to proceed at the
same time, under the superintendance of Brown,
who was the general officer of the day, with
orders
to receive the troops at an appointed
rendezvous
two miles below Prescott.
The commander in chief now wrote an
order
to general Hampton to form a junction with
the army, at St. Regis or its vicinity. This
order was to have been dispatched the next
day by express, but as it was preparing, colonel
King, (Hampton's adjutant-general) fortunately
arrived at the rendezvous, and immediately
departed
with the same. At about eight o'clock in
the evening, the river was enveloped in so heavy
a fog, that it was thought the flotilla might pass
the enemy's batteries unperceived; and
accordingly
orders were given for the troops to march
and the flotilla to advance at the same moment.
But before they reached Prescott, the wind
freshened
,
the fog dispersed, the moon broke forth, and
they were in full view of the enemy. The
general
,
in his gig, proceeded ahead, followed by his
passage boat and staff, and succeeded in order
by the whole flotilla.
46
No sooner were they espied by their vigilant
enemy, than a heavy fire was opened upon them
from the batteries, and a great number of shot and
shells were thrown at the marching column, who
were discovered by their gleaming arms, which
reflected the moon-beams. But not a single shot
took effect, nor did the Americans sustain the
slightest injury. The batteries were passed by
the whole flotilla, except two schooners, loaded
with provisions, which sought for safety in the
river near Ogdensburgh, but were extricated the
next day. By ten o'clock, on Sunday morning,
every one had safely arrived at the appointed
rendezvous.
In the mean time, Scott was on his way from
Fort George to join the expedition; and after
a forced march of nineteen days, through rain
and mud, (during the whole of which time the
sun was not visible for twelve hours) he
learned
,
to his great mortification, upon his arrival in
the neighborhood of Sacket's Harbor, that the
expedition had already taken its departure. He
therefore left his column, and by a forced effort
of two days and one night, came up with the
army
and joined it the day before it passed
Prescott
and Ogdensburgh. He was immediately
assigned
to the command of a handsome battalion
in the van, under colonel M`Comb.
For the four succeeding days, as the army
continued
to descend the river, its rear was almost
incessantly harrassed by the artillery and
gunboats
of the enemy, who had followed it from
Kingston to Prescott, and from Prescott still
continued
the pursuit. Several times was it found
necessary to halt, land, and chastise this
insolence
;
till at length, on Thursday, the eleventh
day of the month, this skirmishing changed to the
form of a regular and well-fought battle,
between
the gallant Boyd's division, of thirteen
hundred men, and a detachment of the British
army
,
of two thousand five hundred men, under
lieutenant-colonel Morrison, aided by nine
gunboats
,
and seven pieces of artillery. The main
body of the American army, with all their
gunboats
,
were far in advance of the field of action,
which was on Chrystler's farm, in Williamsburg,
on the Canadian shore.
Wilkinson and Lewis were both too much
indisposed
,
during this affair, to leave their
cabins
,
and therefore the command devolved on
Boyd alone, who advanced upon the enemy in a
most gallant manner, with his detachment formed
in three columns. The brave Ripley was sent
forward to bring the enemy to action; and with
his undaunted regiment, he twice charged the
enemy's
advance, consisting of two regiments
united
,
(either of them more than equal to his own)
and succeeded in driving them over the ravines
and fences which intersected the field of battle,
now celebrated by the name of Chrystler's field.
Meanwhile, Covington, at the head of his
brigade
,
had advanced upon the enemy's right in a
style of such conspicuous gallantry, that he
attracted
the attention of a party of sharp shooters
stationed in Chrystler's house, one of whom too
fatally levelled his piece and shot the brave leader
from his horse.
Commission'd with the hero's doom,
Lightning wing'd a cruel ball
'Twas the herald of the tomb,
Covington obey'd the call.
For some time after losing their valiant leader,
this brigade continued to advance in the most
determined
manner, until the fire of the enemy's
artillery at length succeeded in breaking and
dispersing them. The battle, however,
continued
with obstinate resolution on both sides for
more than two hours, when the grand object of
the Americans was obtained, which was to
embark
and proceed down the river unmolested.
The enemy felt too sore to pursue them.
Many officers distinguished themselves on this
occasion, both previous and subsequent to the
fall of the immortal Covington. Preston was
severely
wounded, while nobly fighting at the head
of his regiment. The brave Cummins met with
a similar fate, while leading to a charge, and
undiscouraged
by the wound, continued to advance
until loss of blood obliged him to retire. His
friend Willoughby, who had volunteered his
services
as aid to Boyd, received a wound in the
foot as he was bearing his commander's orders
across the field. General Swartwout; colonel
Preston; majors Chambers and Noon; captains
Foster, Townsend, Myers, Campbell, and
Murdock
;
lieutenants Heaton, Williams, Lynch,
Brown and Crary, will all carry to their graves
honorable marks of their bravery on this
occasion
many
of their wounds were very severe.
Lieutenants Smith, Hunter, and Olmstead, fell
gloriously on the field, martyrs to the cause in
which they were engaged. Colonels Coles,
Pearce, Gaines, Ripley, Swift, Upham, Walback,
Johnson, and Aspinwall; majors Woodford,
Malcom
,
Morgan, Grafton, Gardner, and Bebee;
captain Irvin; lieutenants Whiting and Worth,
and many of the platoon officers, acquitted
themselves
with great honor on this occasion. The
total loss of the Americans was one hundred and
two killed, and two hundred and thirty-seven
wounded.
Early on Friday morning the American army
proceeded on its route, and, in the course of the
forenoon, reached Barnhart, near Cornwall,
where Wilkinson received a letter from Hampton,
informing him that many unfortunate
circumstances
would prevent his meeting him at St. Regis,
and that the only way in which he could effectually
co-operate with Wilkinson, would be to meet him
before Montreal, for which place Hampton would
immediately march by the way of Plattsburgh.
On receipt of this letter, Wilkinson consulted his
principal officers on the question of proceeding,
who determined that the expedition should be
immediately abandoned and the army quit the
Canadian side of the St. Lawrence, and go into
winter-quarters at French Mills, on Salmon
river
,
which it accordingly did on the thirteenth of
November, and thus closed the second campaign
of the northern army. The village of French
Mills is situated at the head of navigation of
Salmon
creek, in the township of Constable, county
of Franklin, state of New-York, about two
hundred
and thirty miles from Albany. Hampton's
army went into winter quarters about the same
time, and the command was resigned to
general
Izard.

CHAPTER LIX.
THE INVADERS INVADED.
While the lingering moon delay'd,
In the wilderness of night,
Ere the morn awoke the shade
Into loveliness and light
Britain's tigers, wild for blood,
Darted on our sleeping fold,
Down the mountains, o'er the flood,
Dark as thunder-clouds they roll'd.
Montgomeryaltered
.
While
the northern army was descending the
St. Lawrence, the militia and volunteers under
M`Clure were engaged in frequent skirmishes on
the peninsula; and as soon as the expedition
against Montreal was known to be abandoned, a
British force of fifteen hundred regulars, and
above seven hundred Indians, proceeded towards
Fort George with the determination of entirely
expelling the Americans from the Canadian shore
of the Niagara.
The situation of M`Clure was now extremely
unpropitious; the militia were daily deserting
him, the enemy rapidly advancing, and all was
confusion and dismay. Such was the posture of
affairs when the brave Fraser (the distinguished
aid-de-camp of Pike) arrived at the encampment
and offered his services to M`Clure in any
capacity
.
The general immediately made him his
aid, and gave him a command of Indians, who
were much attached to him, having been in
several
skirmishes with him during the command of
Boyd on the peninsula. Of this Indian corps,
young Logan was second in command.
The remainder of the militia having now
completed
the term of service for which they had
engaged
,
re-crossed the river, and returned to their
homes, with the exception of about one hundred
and fifty, among whom were a double portion of
officers. Those who did remain, could be relied
on, but they were too few to contend, with any
probability of success, against the advancing
enemy
.
A council of war was therefore called, on
the tenth of December, in which it was proposed
to burn Newark, and abandon the British side of
the Niagara; and to this proposition a majority
acceded.
But the enemy were advancing in great force,
and were now within twelve miles of the fort. To
burn the village at this time would hasten their
approach, and the artillery and baggage would
probably fall into their hands. What was then
to be done? Fraser proposed to send a flag of
truce, on some pretence, to the enemy, and thus
gain time until the sick, the baggage, and the
artillery
,
could be conveyed across the river, and
then set fire to the village. This proposition was
instantly adopted, and Fraser immediately
departed
with the flag, to meet the advancing foe,
accompanied by a major Bennet, who went in the
capacity of his servant, for the purpose of
ascertaining
,
if possible, the force of the enemy.
Owing to some misunderstanding, the village
was fired sooner than the hour previously agreed
upon, so that Fraser and Bennet narrowly
escaped
captivity, or even a worse fate; for they had
left the enemy's camp scarcely three minutes,
when the blaze of Newark burst in full splendor
upon the view of the British army, and highly
exasperated
their leader, who instantly ordered out
the dragoons in chase of the flag-bearer and his
companion.
But the same cause which alarmed the enemy,
had, at the same instant, admonished Fraser and
Bennet of their danger; and they consequently
succeeded in outrunning the pursuing troop.
Several of the best mounted were, however,
evidently
gaining on the fugitives, when they
crossed
a small bridge within three miles of the scene
of conflagration. The planks of which this bridge
was composed were laid loose upon cross beams,
and of this circumstance they determined to take
an advantage. The resolution was formed and
executed in a moment. One of them sprang from
his horse, and while his companion held the
bridle
,
threw six or eight of the loose planks into the
stream; then remounted, and again galloped
forward
.
The stream which this bridge covered was
narrow
,
but deep, and ran between two hills, one of
which Fraser and Bennet were ascending, as the
British dragoons were rushing furiously down the
other, towards the bridge, with their eyes fixed on
the objects of their pursuit, whom they now
considered
as certainly within their grasp.
Forward
!
exclaimed their leader. It was his last
exclamation, in the next moment both horse and
rider were precipitated through the timbers into
the stream; three of his followers shared the
same fate, and the rest narrowly escaped by
suddenly
checking their steeds. The pursuit was
then relinquished, while Fraser and Bennet
arrived
at the American camp in safety. The British
forces arrived only in time to find themselves
without shelter or batteries, and were obliged to
fall back to Queenston, from whence M`Clure in
vain attempted to dislodge them by the batteries
at Lewiston. The inhabitants of Newark had
twelve hours notice to remove their effects, and
those who chose to cross the river, were liberally
provided with all the necessaries of life.
It was now very reasonable to expect some
retaliatory
measure on the part of the enemy, and
to be in readiness to meet such measure was the
primary object of the American commander. He
therefore left captain Leonard in command of
Fort Niagara, with about one hundred and sixty
effective regulars, and pointed out verbally, and
particularly in a general order, how he should
prepare for an attack, which he assured him would
certainly take place. He then stationed colonel
Grieves' artillerists, consisting of about twenty
men, with two pieces of artillery, at Lewiston,
under the command of major Bennet, and made
them a present of four hundred dollars for
volunteering
their services three weeks. About forty
Canadian volunteers, who had previously
espoused
the American cause, he stationed at Schlosser,
under major Mallory, an officer of great merit,
and then transferred his head-quarters to Buffalo,
to provide for the safety of that place and Black
Rock, having first made arrangements for calling
out all the neighboring militia
en masse
.
Notwithstanding M`Clure's positive orders,
Leonard neglected to prepare for an attack, which
every one knew would shortly be made; and on
the evening of the eighteenth of December, he
left the fort, in company with Sandford, at about
eleven o'clock. Sandford crossed the river, and
Leonard took up his quarters at a farm-house,
two miles distant from the Fort, the principal
gate of which was left open.
At four o'clock the next morning, about four
hundred of the enemy, white and red, crossed
the river, and entered the fort so silently, that
the garrison was not alarmed until they had
complete
possession. The only resistance they met
with, was from a guard in one of the block-houses,
and a number of invalids in the hospital, who
defended themselves until they were
overpowered
and put to death by the bayonet. A most
horrid slaughter ensued, until above eighty of
the Americans were butchered, and nearly twenty
severely wounded. A non-commissioned officer
and twenty privates, made their escape by
scaling
the pickets at the first alarm. As soon as
the slaughter had ceased, and the survivors
secured
as prisoners, the private property in the
fort was given up to plunder, and not a single
article was restored to the owners. The women
of the garrison were stripped of their apparel,
and many of them wantonly killed; the persons
of the dead officers were treated with shocking
indignity.
After the enemy had become complete masters
of the fort, Leonard arrived, and was made
prisoner
.
The British flag was then unfurled, and
the enemy had the entire command of the mouth
of the Niagara.
Lewiston was attacked the same morning by
above seven hundred Indians, and bravely
defended
by the gallant Bennet, and his little
detachment
of militia, who resisted the assailants
until entirely surrounded. Bennet then
desperately
cut his way through the enemy's ranks,
and effected his retreat with the loss of eight
men. Lewiston, Youngstown, Manchester, and
the Indian Tuscarora, were all speedily reduced
to ashes, and many of the men, women, and
children
,
massacred as they fled from the
conflagration
.
The brave Mallory, who commanded the
forty Canadian volunteers at Schlosser, boldly
advanced against the Indians while they were in
the act of setting fire to Lewiston, and attacked
them with such impetuosity that they were
compelled
to fall back to the foot of the mountain.
The Indians, however, were soon reinforced, and
the gallant Mallory was in turn obliged to retire.
In the course of the same month, Buffalo also
shared the fate of Lewiston,and the whole Niagara
frontier was rapidly laid waste by the enemy,
and entirely depopulated. All the settlements in
a section of country forty miles square, and which
contained more than twelve thousand souls, were
effectually broken up. The roads were filled
with fugitives from the scene of devastation, of
every age, sex, and condition, many of whom
had been reduced from a state of competence
and fair prospects, to the last degree of want and
sorrow. Many of them had beheld their dearest
connexions fall beneath the tomahawk, and
horribly
mangled without distinction of sex or age.
With so much terror were they dispersed, that in
some instances, mothers found themselves
wandering
with strange children, while the fate of
their own offspring was altogether unknown to
them. The sympathy of their fellow-citizens
was soon awakened by their sufferings, and
such relief afforded them as their immediate
bodily wants demanded. But what relief could
reach their distressed minds? Who could restore
a murdered wifeinfanthusbandsister
brother
!
Scarcely a family had fled that would ever
again meet all its members in this world; for the
same violence which had reduced them to
beggary
,
and turned them naked into a northern
wilderness
,
in the dead of winter, had also severed
the ties which united them, by lopping from
every family-tree some of its most flourishing
branches.
The enemy had been obstinately opposed in
his advance against Buffalo, by two or three
hundred
raw and undisciplined militia, commanded
by colonel Blakeslie, who proved himself a hero
on the occasion, as did likewise all his officers,
among whom was the gallant Riddle, who
had previously distinguished himself at
Little-York
.
Fraser, who was now major of a
battalion of Indians,
[30]
[30]
These Indians cherished so great an affection for Fraser, that
they adopted him as one of the chiefs of their tribe, and gave him
the name of
The-Black-Wolf
, or
Walk-All-Night
.
was wounded in this affair,
after making several prisoners on the margin of
the village. After laying waste the country,
reducing
every village to ashes, and inflicting
unheard-of
cruelties on the defenceless inhabitants,
the enemy retired from every position he had
occupied in the American territory, except Fort
Niagara, which he put in a better state of
defence
,
and from it made frequent excursions,
which were generally attended by acts of
violence
and cruelty.
Stern Winter had now taken the field, with his
boisterous
northern
forces, and all military
operations
were for a time suspended between
belligerent
mortals. During this temporary truce, the
regular troops in the northern military district of
New-York were under the command of the heroic
Brown, who was laboriously and constantly
employed
in providing for their comfort and good
order, and in improving and familiarizing himself
in the theory and practice of modern tactics.
When a plan of the ensuing campaign was
adopted
by government, the execution of it on the
Niagara frontier was committed to Brown; he
was accordingly promoted to the rank of
major-general
,
and took the field early in the spring.
The gallant Scott spent a great part of the
winter at Albany. Early in March, he was
promoted
to the rank of brigadier-general, and joined
Brown there, on his route to the Niagara
frontier
,
early in the following April. Soon after,
Brown was recalled to Sacket's Harbor, and the
command in consequence devolved on Scott, who
immediately assembled the army, and established
a camp of instruction at Buffalo. Here, without
regard to rank, all the officers were rigorously
drilled by the commanding general in person;
these in their turn drilled the privates; in a short
time the army was perfectly organized, and, by
the unwearied exertions and example of Scott,
the strictest routine and discipline were
established
throughout the whole.
Fraser spent the winter with his friends, and
the following spring was appointed senior
lieutenant
in the third rifle regiment, and ordered to
the south; upon which he repaired to
Washington
and declined the appointment, preferring to
retain his old grade and to fight in company with
his old friends, to recruiting in the south. Porter
solicited the war-department for the services of
Fraser as his aid-de-camp, engaging to give him
a command of Indians whenever an opportunity
offered for employing them. The secretary of
war immediately conceded to the wishes of the
47
brave young officer, and promoted him in his own
regiment.
Captain Willoughby remained with the
northern
army in winter-quarters at French Mills;
and when off duty amused himself in writing to
his friends and completing his journal, an extract
from which shall be given in the next chapter.
He had received a letter from Fleming, dated at
Quebec, the fourth of November, who informed
him that he was there closely confined, and was
threatened to be detained as a British subject,
and tried for holding a commission in the
American
militia. This distressing intelligence,
George immediately communicated to his father,
but carefully withheld it from Catharine.

On
the fourth day of July, one thousand eight
hundred and thirteen, the anniversary of
American
independence was celebrated, as usual,
throughout the United States. It was also
celebrated
by a little guard of twelve Americans,
who occupied Fort Schlosser, near Niagara falls,
whose festive rites were unfortunately interrupted
by a nocturnal visit from the enemy, who
completely
surprised the guard, made them all
prisoners
,
and conveyed them across the river,
together
with one brass six-pounder, fifty-seven
stand of arms, a quantity of ammunition, salt,
tobacco
,
pork and whiskey.
July
11. The enemy crossed the river, and
made an attack on Black Rock, set fire to the
barracks
,
block-house, and other buildings, spiked
several pieces of cannon, and took off a quantity
of provisions. Whilst carying the property to
their boats, they were attacked by a force of
regulars
,
militia, and a few Indians, who poured
upon
them a very destructive fire, and compelled
them to take to their boats, with the loss of more
than fifty killed and wounded. General Porter
and major King were very active on this
occasion
.
July
21. Lieutenant Colonel Christie, of
New-York
,
who signalized himself at the battle of
Queenston, died at Fort George.
August
2. Fort Stephenson besieged, and
gallantly
defended by major Croghan, &c.
August
4. The privateer Decatur, captain
Diron, captured the British armed schooner
Dominico
,
captain Barrette, after the most obstinate
and bloody battle ever recorded in the annals
of naval warfare.
August
14. The United States brig Argus,
captain Allen, captured by the English sloop of
war Pelican, captain Maples, after a desperate
action of forty-five minutes, in the commencement
of which captain Allen received a mortal wound,
and expired on the fourth day after the battle. On
board the Argus there were six killed and
seventeen
woundedfive of the latter died soon after
the engagement. The loss of the Pelican was
only three killed and five wounded. In recording
the death of this gallant young officer, the
journalist
feels the tenderest sympathies of his nature
awakened. The deceased was his friend, and both
affection and patriotism prompt him to pay a
tribute
to his memory. He was a herofor the man
who bravely contends with a superior force, until
(finding defeat inevitable) he sacrifices his life for
his country, deserves all the plaudits to which
the more successful victor is entitled. Allen
signalized
himself in the action between the United
States and Macedonian, and was soon afterwards
appointed to command the Argus, and
conduct
the American minister to France; from
France he was to proceed to the Irish channel,
and there cruise for the enemy's merchant
vessels
.
This was a very perilous, and, at the same
time, a very invidious service to a young officer
thirsting for glory. His orders were to burn, sink,
and destroy the enemy's property; but in
performing
this duty, (to the amount of two millions
pounds sterling) he was careful to distinguish his
character from those who depredated for selfish
purposes only. The property of the passengers
was always held sacred as their persons. For
more than two months he continued in this
service
,
and while his enemies lamented their losses
through his vigilance, they all united in paying
the tribute due to the generosity, humanity, and
delicacy, which he exercised to all who fell into
his power. At length the Pelican was fitted out
expressly to capture him; she succeeded, and
took her prize into Plymouth. Allen had been
wounded in the leg, and had submitted to
amputation
above the knee, at sea; but the shattered
state of his thigh precluded all surgical aid. When
he was removed from the Argus to the hospital at
Plymouth, he cast his languid eyes on his faithful
comrades, and feelingly exclaimedGod bless
you, my lads!we shall never meet again.
He was sensible, at intervals, till within ten
minutes
of his dissolution, when he sunk exhausted,
and expired without a struggle. His lucid
intervals
were very cheerful; and he was satisfied and
fully sensible that no advice or assistance could
save his life. On Saturday, the twenty-first, he
was interred with the usual honors of war, at
Plymouth
,
together with midshipman Delphy, (who
had both legs shot from his body at the same
instant) and midshipman Edwards. This article
shall be closed with the following extract from
his last letter, addressed to his sister
When
you shall hear that I have ended my earthly ca
reer, that I only exist in the kind remembrance of
my friends, you will forget my follies, forgive
my faults, call to mind some little instances dear
to reflection, to excuse your love for meand

to proceed down the St. Lawrence, with a
small party, in three gigs, secret himself in some
of the islands, and watch a favorable opportunity
to surprise a brigade of store-boats belonging to
the enemy, and either bring them off, or destroy
them. The enemy, however, discovered him,
and sent a gun-boat in pursuit, when he instantly
formed the bold design to board her, which he
did, and carried her without losing a man, one
of the enemy being badly wounded. She proved
to be a fine gun-boat, manned with eighteen men,
chiefly chiefly royal marines. Gregory manned his
prize, and proceeded up the river, but was
pursued
by another large gun-boat, which
over-hauled
him fast. He kept possession of his prize
until the enemy threw their shot over him; he
then very reluctantly took out his prisoners,
scuttled
her, and effected his escape with all his
prisoners
.

a detachment of the enemy, from the post of La
Cole. The colonel made an attack, retreated,
and attempted to draw the enemy into an
ambuscade
;
but, in his zeal, discovered himself and
his party too soon, and an action commenced
before
the British were ensnared. After killing
seventeen of their number, Forsyth received a
48
wound in the neck, of which he died in a few
days after, and was buried with military honors
at Champlain. Thus ended the career of glory
in which this enterprising officer was engaged.
He had lived the terror of his enemies, and he
died deeply lamented by his friends. A braver
officer the army never lost.
June
28. The United States sloop of war
Wasp, captain Blakely, captured and destroyed
the English sloop of war Reindeer, captain
Manners

wounded; while the American loss was only five
killed and twenty-one wounded.
June
30. Lieutenant Gregory surprised the
British at Presque'Isle, on Lake Ontario, and
burnt a large schooner which was building there.
The foregoing is a brief sketch of the journal
kept by captain Willoughby, for one year. It is
probable that I may hereafter furnish my readers
with another extract from the same manuscript;
but at present I must request the favor of their
company to Ithaca, where the lovely, disconsolate
Catharine demands our attendance; and as I
shall convey them thither without the least trouble
or expense, I trust that they will have no cause
to regret the journey.
CHAPTER LXI.
AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY.
Sure some ill fate's upon me:
Distrust and heaviness sit round my heart,
And apprehension shocks my timorous soul.
Otway's Orphan
.
The
spirits of Catharine were, for some time,
supported by the hope of her father's speedy
restoration to liberty; which hope was
assiduously
cherished by her friends in Ithaca, and by the
letters of major Willoughby, Amelia, and George.
But, hope deferred maketh the heart sick, and
before the winter had half expired, the heart of
Catharine had become cheerless as the season.
A settled melancholy took possession of her soul,
blanched her sunken cheeks, and dimmed the
mild lustre of her humid eyes. In vain her
affectionate
aunt strove to impart comfort and
peace to her afflicted bosom; and equally
fruitless
were the assiduities of her gay young cousin.
She faintly smiled her thanks for their tender
exertions
,
and eagerly retired to that solitude in
which she could yield to the impulse of her
feelings
,
and weep unobserved.
About the middle of January, she was
deprived
of the enlivening society of her cousin, who
commenced a tour to the southward, for the
purpose
of consummating a matrimonial negociation
which had been commenced previous to the death
of his father, while the lover was a clerk in a
compting-house at New-Orleans. The object of
his attachment was the daughter of his employer,
an opulent merchant in that city, who most
cordially
approved his daughter's choice, and only
withheld his consent until the young gentleman
should become of age. This period had now
arrived, and young Woodcock, rich in wealth,
love, and honor, commenced the journey which
was to terminate in the bower of connubial
felicity
.
He was not expected to return short of a
twelvemonth.
As the spring approached, the health of Mrs.
Woodcock began to decline; until, at length, her
complaint assumed the alarming symptoms of a
confirmed dropsy; and before midsummer she
was unable to leave her chamber. Catharine
began now to fear that Heaven would spare her
no friends to console or protect her. The idea
of being soon thrown on the wide world, a
friendless
orphan, was ever present to her imagination,
and had not Hope still whispered the name of
Willoughby, she would have soon fallen a victim
to melancholy, and only looked, only asked for
peace beyond the grave.
Thus drooping in despondency, every image
presented to her imagination received a tincture
of gloom from the sombre medium through which
she beheld it, while the dmon of melancholy
sat like an Incubus on her heart, and retarded
the circulation of its fluids. Deprived of her
parentsdependent on the bounty of others, and
far distant from the dearest object of her
affections
,
she felt like an insulated, deserted being
an exile, friendless and alone. Nay, her gloomy
fancy even suggested doubts of that affection
with which the bosom of our hero so ardently
glowed.
If he really loved me, (thought she) would
he thus endure the anguish of so long a
separation
?
Would he not have abandoned every other
pursuit, and flown to give me comfort, when the
news of my sorrows first reached him? Alas! he
does notcannot love like me! Catharine may
sink under her afflictions, and George will then
too late lament his neglect and voluntary absence.
He will be very unhappy that he did not see me
before I died!
Such free indulgence did she give to these
melancholy
fancies, and so tenderly did she cherish
them, that they became established in her mind
for facts, and she actually wrote to her lover
bidding
him an affectionate adieu, and hoping to meet
him in that world to which she was rapidly
hastening
.
My readers shall have a peep at this
epistle in another place, if they will exercise a
little patience.
It was near the close of a beautiful day in the
beginning of July. Catharine was seated on a
sofa by the side of her aunt, whom she was
regaling
with a page of her favorite Hervey, when
the servant announced a gentleman who wished
to see Miss Fleming. Catharine's heart beat
very rapidly at that moment, but it sunk in
disappointment
when she saw a stranger enter the
room. His stature was a little below the
common
size, his features coarse and his manners
unpolished. He approached the ladies with a
bow, and then with a downcast look and
hesitating
voice, accosted Catharine
Miss Fleming, I am a messenger from your
father.
O, where is he? exclaimed they, both at
once. How is my father? Where is my
brother?
48*
Mr. Fleming is in New-Yorknot so well
in health as I could wishbut
Oh! he is dead! My poor father is dead!
exclaimed Catharine bursting into tears. I
know it by your mannerI can read it in your
looks. Oh! auntwe shall never see him more!
Your fears overstep the fact, replied the
stranger. He is not dead. True, he is ill
very ill; but he may yet recover. This letter,
though not written by his own hand, was dictated
by his own lips, and will explain the purport of
my embassy.
So saying, he delivered the letter to Catharine,
and took a seat near the sofa. The agitated girl
summoned all her little strength to break the seal,
and then read aloud as follows:
New-York
,
June
26
th
, 1814.
Be not alarmed, my daughter, that this letter
is not written by your father's hand. That hand
is, alas! too much enfeebled by disease to hold
a pen; I have, therefore, employed that of my
most excellent friend, captain Miller, who has
generously offered to make a journey to Ithaca
for the sole purpose of conveying to you the last
injunctions and blessing of your affectionate
father
.
O let me fly to him instantly! exclaimed
the distressed girl, rising and advancing to the
messenger. He will die among strangers, and
I shall never see him. Let us go immediately!
Be composed, my love, replied her aunt.
Your father may not be so dangerously ill as
you imagine. At any rate, you must not think
of undertaking such a journey alone, and you
know I am unable to accompany you.
Let me intreat you to be more composed,
Miss Fleming, said captain Miller,
affectionately
taking her hand. Endeavor to summon
sufficient
fortitude to finish reading that letter, and
then I will speak further of your father.
After a short struggle with her tears, Catharine
could again distinguish the characters on the
paper she held, and thus continued to read
My long captivity, close confinement, and
sorrow of heart, have all conspired to destroy
my constitution; and my health is now so much
impaired, that I have very little hopes of its
restoration. Several of your letters reached me
in Canada, and each of them afforded me
comfort
,
except that in which you mentioned the
illness
of my sister. But we must learn to be
resigned
to every event that may befal us, and hope
for our reward in another life.
Be attentive to your aunt, my child, while
she is spared to you, for I fear that you are
destined
to be an orphan. I dare not say how
ardently I wish to see you, because the journey
is of such prodigious length. Captain Miller,
(under whose hospitable roof I meet the most
delicate attention) insists upon visiting you in his
own carriage, and making you the companion of
his return. I have objected to laying any
member
of my family under such an immense
obligation
to a friend; but in this proposition he is so
earnestly seconded by his amiable sister, who
wishes to accompany him, that I have finally
consented
for them to make the journey, leaving it
to your own discretion, whether it will be
prudent
to undertake so arduous a task in the
present
state of your health.
Should we never again meet on earth, may
the choicest blessings of Heaven attend your
steps through life, and its mercy restore you to
the embraces of your parents in another world.
Adieu, my childadieu.
Henry Fleming
.
O, sir, let us depart instantlyanother
moment may be too late. I am resolved to
accompany
youdear aunt, make no
objections
it
is to see a dying fatherto close
his eyes
Choked with grief, she now sunk exhausted
on the sofa. The aunt was herself much
affected
,
and a tear trembled in the stranger's eye.
Where have you left your sister? asked
Mrs. Woodcock.
In the carriage at the door, ready to pay her
respects here, as soon as I had prepared the way
for an introduction. With your leave, I will now
show her up.
Captain Miller left the room, and in a moment
after returned with a very pretty female in the
plain dress of a quakeress, whom he introduced
as Julia Miller. Though small of stature, her
shape was symmetry itself; the flush of health
bloomed on her cheeks, the flash of vivacity
sparkled in her jet black eye, and her whole
countenance was expressive and animated. She
gracefully approached Catharine, took a seat by
her side, and in the most tender manner,
endeavored
to soothe her sorrows and inspire her with
hope and consolation. She so far succeded that
the latter began to make arrangements for her
departure with a considerable degree of
composure
.
At sunrise the next morning, the carriage of
captain Miller, containing himself, his sister, and
Catharine, was on the road to Owego, and before
dark arrived at Unadilla. Another day's journey
brought them to Bethel, a third to Goshen, and
a fourth to Peramus, a village in Jersey, on a
branch of the celebrated Passaic, about twenty
miles from New-York.
As they approached the city, the weeping
Catharine became more and more agitatedshe
trembled to encounter the moment which was to
dispel her doubts, and perhaps confirm her worst
fears. Still, however, she grew more impatient
of delay, and imagined that the last day's
journey
was very tardily performed. There was
indeed some grounds for such an idea, for the
driver
affirmed that one of the horses had sprained
a leg, and could not proceed with his usual speed.
They dined at Hackensack, and were obliged to
tarry two hours after dinner while a blacksmith
repaired some part of the carriage. This,
together
with some unavoidable subsequent delays,
so retarded their progress, that the sun was setting
when the carriage drove into the steam-boat at
Powles-Hook. In a few minutes more,
Catharine
found herself in the city where she had first
landed on her emigration to America, but where
she was now a total stranger.
The carriage rattled onward over the
pavements
of Cortlandt-street, and Catharine awaited
in silence the moment that it was to stop at the
door of captain Miller, which, Julia had
previously
informed her, was at No. 176 Chatham-square.
It was now quite dark, and her impatience
increased
;
her companions had become silent and
thoughtful, while her own reflections were of the
most gloomy cast. The crisis of her fate was at
handeither she was to find herself already a
helpless orphan, or had arrived in season to
receive
the verbal blessing and close the eyes of a
dying father. The carriage still rolled on, and
she wondered what remote corner of the city was
called Chatham-square.
At length they stopped in front of a genteel
looking house. Miller sprang from the carriage
and handed out the ladies, whom he conducted
into the house in silence. Courage, my dear,
said Julia to Catharine as she felt her tremble
while she supported her into the houseIn a
moment you will embrace your father.
Ah! if he be still living, replied Catharine.
An elderly lady now met them in the hall, to
whom Julia introduced Catharine, and who
informed
her that her father was much better.
O lead me to him instantly, cried
Catharine
.
Better or worse, I must see him while my
strength remains.
He has just fallen into a sweet sleep, replied
the lady, and I fear your agitation would
disturb
him. Compose yourself a few minutes, and
swallow some refreshments, which you very much
stand in need of, and then you shall be gratified.
Catharine felt that she did indeed require rest
and refreshment, and therefore suffered
herself
to be led by Julia and her mother into a
back parlor, where tea was already prepared,
and of which the young ladies partook without
changing their travelling dresses. During this
little repast, Catharine's mind received still more
relief than her exhausted frame, for the cheerful
old lady gave her such encouraging accounts of
her father's health, and assurances of his
convalescence
,
that Catharine's bosom bounded with
hope, and her countenance wore even an
occasional
smile.
His physician was here but a few moments
before you arrived, continued the good hostess,
and after administering an opiate, assured both
him and myself that nothing would prove so
great a restorative as sleep, and begged that he
might not be disturbed. He began to recover
four days ago, and has frequently expressed his
regret that he permitted his daughter to be
alarmed
by the steps that had been taken. He set up
to-day for several hours, appeared very cheerful,
and had a very flattering appetite. I
congratulate
you, my dear Miss Fleming, on the good
news it is my happiness to communicate. One
half hour more of sleep, will make a new man
of him.
In this manner the old lady ran on, as she
handed the tea and cake to the young ones, and
Catharine suffered the half-hour to expire with a
tolerable degree of patience. She then renewed
her request to be conducted to her father, whom
she promised not to disturb while he appeared
disposed to sleep; she only wished to sit by him
and watch his slumbers until he awoke.
The old lady now consented, and led her up
stairs to a chamber very elegantly furnished,
where a candle was burning.
There lies your father, said she in a
whisper
,
on that sofa. Take a seat by him, and in
a few moments Julia and I will rejoin you. Be
careful and not disturb him. Excuse me for a
few minutes.
Catharine approached the sofa, and for a
moment
hesitated, before she could summon sufficient
fortitude to raise the cloak which covered that
face she so much wished, yet so dreaded to
behold
.
Perhaps (thought she) it is so emaciated by
disease, that I shall not be able to trace the
features
;
how shall I support the shock which I
must experience on contemplating the ravages
of sickness in the countenance of the best of
fathers
.
With a trembling hand, she raised the
covering
,
but the arm of the sofa so shaded the visage
that its emaciated appearance was not visible.
She bent over him a moment in silence, and then
obeyed the irresistible impulse of her feelings,
by stooping down and imprinting on his lips a
kiss of filial affection.
CHAPTER LXII.
A DEVELOPMENT OF FACTS.
What is't a woman cannot do?
She'll make a statesman quite forget his cunning.
And trust his dearest secrets to her breast.
Otway
.
During
our hero's unfortunate connection
with Sophia, in her two characters, she had drawn
much more largely on his confidence than he
himself
was aware of. What he had withheld from
Reuben, had been obtained by the artful Sophia;
and that which it was improper to tell Sophia,
had been previously communicated to Reuben.
She knew the whole history of his attachment for
Catharine, his former connextion with Sandford,
and the cause of their present enmity. No
sooner
,
therefore, was she dismissed by Willoughby,
than she determined to make Sandford the
instrument
of her revenge; and accordingly repaired
immediately to his quarters, told her story, and
proposed an alliance, offensive and defensive,
which was immediately agreed to and ratified.
Sandford was soon afterwards ordered to Fort
Niagara, in the neighborhood of which he took
genteel lodgings for Sophia, who resumed the
habiliments of her sex, and unblushingly avowed
herself the mistress of Sandford.
But Sophia's favors were not exclusively
bestowed
on her nominal protector; officers of
superior
rank, whose reputation the breath of
suspicion
never sullied, secretly enjoyed her
caresses
,
and the mighty Achilles of the day, was
often
the melting Paris of the evening. Proud of
her conquests, and more ambitious of subduing
rank than of attracting beauty, she aspired to
assail
some of the most elevated objects within the
sphere of her fascinations, nor aspired in vain.
Revolutionary laurels were cast at her feet, while
age and infirmity reposed on her ambitious bosom.
Sandford was too well versed in the character
of fallen woman, to expect constancy in a
mistress
.
Feeling no affection for Sophia, he
winked
at her incontinence, and only retained her as
an apt instrument for which he hoped soon to find
employment in the schemes of vengeance he was
meditating against captain Willoughby. But
though it was the principal study of both to
discharge
the debt of hatred they owed our hero,
still no opportunity occurred of bringing any of
their diabolical plans to maturity; and the object
of their malice was daily rising in the estimation
49
of all, except such wretches as were concerting his
ruin.
The destination of the northern army
remained
a secret to the nationbut by some means or
other, this secret (among many others) found its
way to the bosom of Sophia, and was by her
imparted
to Sandford. The town of Kingston was
to be attacked, and in its then present state of
defence, must certainly fall before the American
arms. The object of Sandford's hatred would
here again signalize himself, and rise still higher
above him in reputationperhaps in rank. He
knew of no way to prevent the success of the
expedition
,
and could only vent his spleen in
curses.
The mother of Sandford was a native of
Kingston
,
and all his maternal relatives were still
British
subjects. His uncle Morris, with whom he
had been in the habit of corresponding previous
to the war, owned a very valuable farm on the
peninsula, a few miles from Newark, near the
lake shore, on which he still resided. This man
had, more than once, since the commencement of
hostilities, solicited his nephew to abandon the
American cause, and embrace that in which all
his maternal kinsmen were engaged. To these
solicitations Sandford paid little attention, until
they were renewed with a promise, on the part
of his uncle, to make him his heir, as he had no
child of his own.
He now began to reflect seriously on the
subject
,
and finally signified his resolution to comply,
as soon as he could sell his estates in
Massachusetts
,
and by some bold act of treachery render
his desertion of service to the British. The
estates
were soon sold by his agent, and the money
vested according to his directions. He now only
awaited a favorable opportunity of putting the
more hazardous part of his scheme into execution.
Ever ripe for mischief, Sophia readily entered
into the plan, and proposed such amendments
and improvements as filled Sandford with
admiration
at her ready invention and deep
discerning
subtilty. She had recently and suddenly
conceived a most mortal hatred against some
military character, which at that time stood high
in public estimation, and she determined, if
possible
,
to blast his prospects of approaching glory.
A consultation was held on the subject, and
Sandford
instantly perceived that the same weapon
which was to pierce a general, might also wound
a captain.
During a temporary absence of Leonard,
Sandford had command of the garrison at
Niagara
,
and in the following night dispatched a
boat on a short but secret expedition up the lake.
Reuben was a young officer who had volunteered
his services to enter the British camp as a spy,
and as not only his life, but also the success of
the American arms depended on secrecy, the
boatmen were charged to that effect. Their
instructions
were to proceed with muffled oars
about ten miles towards the head of the lake,
land the officer, and return with as much
expedition
as possible. Having the necessary
directions
,
Reuben proceeded from the shore to the
house of Morris, which was about two miles
from the head-quarters of De Rottenberg, and
announced himself as the messenger of Sandford.
He was of course received with a cordial
welcome
,
and on the following day, the interview
took place which was witnessed by Willoughby
and Cummins, as recorded in the fifty-sixth
chapter
of this history. Agreeably to instructions,
Reuben
tarried with Morris, until joined by Sandford
himself, which event did not take place until the
morning of the nineteenth of December, when
Fort Niagara was betrayed to the enemy. With
the subsequent events on that frontier, the reader
is already acquainted.
So disastrous a termination of the campaign,
filled every patriot bosom with surprise and
indignation
.
The representatives of the people
immediately demanded of the president the causes
of these disgraceful effects; and, in obedience
to this demand, the records of the
war-department
were submitted to public inspection.
But little light, however, was thrown upon the
subject from that quarter, and it still remained
enveloped in the gloom of doubt and uncertainty.
This cloud is finally removeda flash of
inspiration
from the historic muse, has at length
dissipated the illusive vapors of conjecture, and
the reader can now trace the whole concatenation
of disasters to the black eyes, and still blacker
heart of Sophia.
To repair the misfortunes and redeem the
honor of the American arms, was the grand
object
on which the congregated wisdom of the
nation
was now exercised; the first step to the
attainment
of this desirable end, was the
abandonment
of that system of
favoritism
to which the
recent disasters were thought to be attributable.
The materials of the army had now been
effectually
analyzed in a crucible well calculated to
separate the gold from the dross, and it only
required
the exercise of common discernment to
profit by the experiment. To borrow the lan
guage of an elegant writer on the same subject
The rude northern gales of the frontier had
swept away the painted insects which rise and
spread their glittering wings in the summer's
sun, but had served only to rouse and invigorate
those eagle spirits who, during the calm, cower
undisturbed in solitude and silence, but as
the tempest pises, burst from their obscurity, and
stem the storm, and sport themselves in the
gale.
[32]

Captain Treat commanded a picket-guard, which on its return
to camp, (at the commencement of the action) was assailed, in a
meadow of high grass, by a brisk discharge of musketry. One man
fell, severely wounded, and the rear of the guard broke and
retreated
.
Captain Treat's attempts to prevent the flight of the left of his
detachment, were mistaken for an intention to avoid the enemy; and
though be was ordered to a neighboring wood, his guard being first
collected in pursuit of the party that had attacked him, he was
immediately
after stripped of his command, upon the ground of cowardice,
in retreating before the enemy, and of misconduct, in abandoning the
wounded man to their mercy. This man had, however, been brought
in by captain Treat's orders, previously to his march in quest of the
enemy's party. Being resolved on a participation in some way or
other in the approaching battle, the captain entered as a volunteer,
in the same company which he had just before commanded; and the
senior officer of the 21st regiment, directed him to lead a platoon into
action. This act was considered as a manifestation of his courage
and patriotism, and the court martial before which he was tried,
dismissed
him with an honorable acquittal.
Thompson's Historical Sketches, p.
276.
Brown, Scott, Ripley, Gaines, Swift, Miller,
and some others of well-tried talents and
courage
,
now stood forth as the bulwark of their
countrythe real CHAMPIONS OF FREEDOM. Each
of them commanded the confidence of their
country
;
but, as commander in chief, the eyes of
every unprejudiced freeman were directed to
Brown, and government confirmed their choice
by elevating that hero to the rank of
major-general
.
Being thus selected by his admiring
countrymen
as their military chief on the Niagara
frontier, he lost no time in concentrating and
organizing
his army, determined to drive the British
from the peninsula, and regain possession of the
fortresses on both sides the river.
Captain Willoughby being destitute of a
command
,
volunteered his services as aid to the
general
,
who gladly accepted the assistance of an
officer in whose talents and courage he possessed
such implicit confidence. Fort Erie was to be
the first object of attack, and on the morning of
the second of July, the commander in chief
authorised the generals of brigades, to inform the
commandants of corps, that the army would cross
49*
the strait on the following night, so as to invest
that fortress as the next day dawned.
Every bosom now beat high with anticipated
glory, and all were anxious for the coming night.
Before the night came, however, the following
letter
was delivered to captain Willoughby.
Ithaca
,
June
29, 1814.
Adieu, my dearest, best friendadieu, until
we meet in that world where parting will be no
more. I should feel guilty of an unpardonable
neglect, did I longer delay to inform you that I
am rapidly sinking beneath the iron hand of
affliction
.
Grief for the loss of my parents has
made such havoc with my constitution, that my
health I fear can never be again restored. I shall
never cease to love youno, not even in heaven;
next to my Saviour's, your image will be the
object
which I shall contemplate with the greatest
delight, through the boundless ages of eternity.
My greatest earthly comfort is the perusal of your
affectionate epistlesthis is the first I have ever
written to youit will be the last you must ever
expectpreserve it as a legacy of my affection.
I will not concealfor why should I?that your
presence would soothe my dying hour, and
that the transition would be sweet from your
arms to those of my attendant angels, who are
waiting to receive me. But I will not drag you
from those higher duties to which you are called
by your God and your country. Continue to
serve both faithfully, and you will one day be
again restored to your ever faithful
Catharine
.
Catharine dying! exclaimed George,
before
he had finished the second line. Catharine
dying!and I not with her! My horse! Albert
Where's my horse?
Ready for embarkation, replied his man,
with those of the general's staff.
Ah! we cross to-night, replied George with
a sighand after gazing a moment on the ground,
resumed the perusal of his letter.
A severe struggle now took place in his
bosom
a
contest far more dreadful than any which
could await him on the peninsula. On one hand
Duty, Patriotism, Honor, urged their imperious
claimson the other stood weeping Love and
meek-eyed Pity, pointing in expressive silence to
the dying Catharine. To ask leave of absence at
that moment was worse than deathto lose his
Catharine without one parting look, was worse
than a thousand deaths. Another glance at the
letter decided the contest.
Nature triumphedand the rising sun which
beheld the banner of Freedom waving
triumphantly
on the walls of Fort Erie, saw captain
Willoughby outflying the wind, with his back
turned on the scene of glory. He had obtained
leave of absence, and entered the village of
Ithaca
,
just twelve hours after Catharine had left it.
In the mean time the capture of Fort Erie was
followed by a complete and decisive victory over
a division of the British army, consisting of two
thousand men, under the command of
major-general
Riall; and this victory was obtained by
one American brigade of twelve hundred men,
under the gallant Scott, who put the enemy to
flight before the main body of the army was
brought on the field. In this brilliant affair,
(which took place on the plains of Chippewa, the
fifth of July) the British loss was one hundred and
forty-eight killed, three hundred and twenty
wounded, and forty-six made prisoners. The
American loss was sixty killed, two hundred and
forty-nine wounded, and nineteen missing.
Scott's brigade covered itself with glory; and
Brown declared that its gallant leader was
entitled
to the highest praise his country could
bestow
.
Generals Ripley and Porter conducted on
this occasion as became officers of their exalted
reputation. Colonel Campbell was wounded
early in the action, while gallantly leading on his
regiment. Colonel Gardner and major Jones, of
the general's staff, yielded to none in honorable
zeal, courage, intelligence, and attention to duty.
Captains Austin and Spencer, who were aids to
the commander in chief, received his public
acknowledgments
for their bravery and active zeal.
Captain Willoughby, from whom he expected
much, was not present to share in the glory of the
day.
Majors Jessup, Camp, Leavenworth, Wood,
Hindman, and M`Niel; captains Towson, Daliba,
Harrison, King, and Read; lieutenants Palmer,
Barron, De Witt, Patchim, and Brimhall, (the
eight last of whom were woundedsome of them
severely) all rendered themselves conspicuous by
their heroic conduct; as did likewise captains
Treat,
[33]

, vol. iv. p. 476.
Ritchie, Ketcham, Crooker, Harris, and
Riddle. Lieutenants Worth, and Watts, who
were aids to Scott, together with Smith, M`
Donald
and Hall, signalized themselves by the cool
intrepidity with which they discharged their
various
duties in the field.
CHAPTER LXIII.
A LOVER'S RACE.
When love's well timed, 'tis not a fault to love;
The strong, the brave, the virtuous, and the wise,
Sink in the soft captivity together.
Addison's Cato.
It
was not quite sunset, when George knocked
at the door of the mansion which he believed
contained
the dear object of his precipitate journey
unless already relieved from her sufferings by
death. A little black girl received him at the
door, whom he followed, without ceremony, to the
chamber of her mistress. With a palpitating
heart he entered the room, where two or three
elderly
ladies were taking tea with Mrs. Woodcock,
whom he instantly recognized by the external
effects
of her malady. After throwing a timid
glance of enquiry round the room, he summoned
sufficient firmness to name Catharine.
Poor girl! exclaimed the aunt, wiping a
tear from her eye; we were just speaking of
hershe has gone a long and melancholy
journey
.
Our hero had no idea of any journey that
Catharine
could be supposed to have taken, except
that which every mortal is destined to perform.
His worst fears were therefore now verified, and
with a groan that seemed to rend his bosom, he
rushed out of the room, without waiting for any
further explanation, leaving the ladies to form
their own opinions on the state of his intellect.
His sudden entrance had not a little surprised
them, for he had forgotten to announce his name;
but his precipitate exit had heightened their
surprise
to wonder and astonishment.
After wandering about in solitude and
darkness
,
for more than two hours, George became
somewhat composed, and again entered Mrs.
Woodcock's apartment with as little
ceremony
as before. Her visiters had departed, and
the good lady was now in consultation with
her physician. For some moments our hero
stood before them speechless; but at length in a
faltering voice, he enquired
When did the dear angel take her
departure
?
My poor niece was taken away this
morning
at sunrise, replied the aunt; and then after
surveying George a moment, she addedHave
I not the pleasure, sir, of addressing captain
Willoughby
?
Pardon my rudeness, madam. Major
Willoughby
is my father. Now suffer me to take one
look at the form which enshrined so pure a soul.
Let me have the melancholy satisfaction of
beholding
all that remains on earth of the lovely
Catharine.
The good lady lost no time in undeceiving the
bewildered George as to the nature and occasion
of Catharine's long and melancholy journey, and
the reader is left to conjecture his feelings, for I
know of no language adequate to describe them.
But among the various sensations which agitated
his bosom, surprise was not the least. He had
travelled
a hundred and twenty miles in a few hours,
to obtain a parting look from a dying mistress, and
had arrived in season to learn that the object of
his journey had just commenced one herself of
twice the distance!
His pleasure, however, was fully equal to his
surprise, and early the next morning, (after
receiving
the address of captain Miller, which had
been left with Mrs. Woodcock) he departed for
New-York, and entered the steam-boat at
Powles-Hook
at the same time that Catharine landed at
the foot of Courtlandt-street. He proceeded
directly
to the City-Hotel, and took lodgings for
the night.
On the following morning he proceeded
directly
to Chatham-square, and sought for the No. 176;
but to his great surprise he perceived that there
must have been some mistake in the direction he
had received, as there was not so high a number
in the square. He next knocked at every door,
but no captain Miller was to be found. He then
applied, with no better success, at every house
and store in Chatham-street, from the Park to the
Bowery, and from Catharine-street to
Tammany-Hall
.
No captain Miller was to be heard of, nor
any one of that name in this part of the city,
except
William H. Miller, saddler, and John S.
Miller, broker.
Not yet discouraged, he procured Longworth's
Directory, and transcribed a list of all the
Millers
in the city, beginning with Aaron, the
lamp-lighter
,
and ending with Zephaniah, the
blacksmith
,
including Silvanus, the rev. Samuel, and
above ninety others, all of whom he called upon
in succession, without obtaining any intelligence
of his Catharine. Nothing now remained, but to
write an account of his ill-success to her aunt, and
wait for her answer, which might furnish him with
some clue to a discovery.
On the following evening as he was strolling
the promenade of the West Battery, he heard his
name mentioned by some one behind him, and on
turning his head encountered the eyes of Sophia,
in company with two elegant females and three
gentlemen, two of whom were in regimentals.
Although much surprised at this unexpected
meeting, George felt no inclination to address her,
and to avoid her accosting him (were she so
disposed
)
he immediately struck into another path
and continued his contemplative ramble.
In a few minutes, however, he met the same
party before he was aware of it, when Sophia
demanded
,
in an exulting tone
Where is Miss Fleming?
There was a fiend-like expression lurking in
the piercing eye of the speaker, that was visible
in the moon-beam, and almost made George
shudder
as it met his view. A horrid presentiment of
no definite shape or form flitted across his mind,
as he replied to her question, while her party
paused directly before him
If
you
know, have compassion on me, and
tell me.
I
will
tell you, answered she, while her
aspect
brightened with a demoniac pleasure. I
will
tell you, or my vengeance will not be
complete
.
Catharine Fleming is in the arms of your
friend
Sandford, and both are far beyond your
reach. Shall I extend my
compassion
, and tell
you who placed her there?
Born for your use, I live but to oblige you.
Know then, 'twasI.
I forged the letter, I contrived the journey,
I hated, I despised, and I destroy.
Did I not tell you that I knew my instrument and
that revenge should be mine? I am now
revenged
,
and you may go shoot yourself.
So saying she walked on with her party, who
seemed much delighted with her ready quotation
from Zanga. After a little hesitation our hero
turned to pursue them, hoping to gain some
information
that would remove the perplexing
doubts and fears that now occupied his mind.
Shall I introduce you, major? demanded
an officer at his elbow. I have the felicity of
being a satellite of this new planet that has just
arisen in our hemisphere, and if you wish to
revolve
in the same fashionable orbit, permit me to
present you as my friend.
George stared at the speaker a moment, and
then replied
I am as ignorant of your meaning, sir, as you
appear to be of my rank. I have not the honor
of being a major.
50
O, sir, I beg ten thousand pardonsI hope
no offence? I perceive my mistake now; but the
first glance by moonlight deceived meI took you
for the major of our battalionindeed I did.
Your error is quite excusable, sir, replied
George.
Thank you, sirthank you a thousand times,
but my mistake arose from your gazing so
wishfully
after the party which has just passed us.
Accept my arm, sir, and I will explain myself.
You must know, sir, that the offer I inadvertently
made to yourself, would have been highly
gratifying
to the major for whom I mistook you.
Although
a married man, he is a keen dog after
forbidden
gamewell known at the Hermitage.
Perhaps, sir, you are not acquainted at the
Hermitage
?
I am not, sir.
So much the better, because I shall have the
pleasure of introducing you. Mrs. Beacham is a
very accommodating ladyalways glad to see her
friends, of whom I have the honor to be one, sir,
and shall be very proud to present you as a friend
of mine.
You are very kind, sir, replied George,
and I entertain a due sense of the future honor
you intend me. But having a little taste for
astronomy
,
I should esteem it as a present favor, if
you would say something more of the new
planet
you mentioned. Is it now visible?
Goodvery goodexcellent!Where do
you buy your snuff, sir? The planet to which I
allude is now visibleour evening stara second
Venusshe has totally eclipsed all her
cotemporaries
,
and is at this moment in conjunction with
Mars. But to descend from metaphor, sir, I
mean that angel hanging to the colonel's arma
diamond of the first water, just imported from
nobody knows where
and come consigned to
nobody knows who
. It is, however, the general
opinion among
us
, that she dropped from the
heavens.
She must be a
fallen
angel, then, replied
George, fixing his eye on Sophia, behind whom
they continued to walk.
Good, sirvery goodexcellent!Where
do you buy your snuff, sir? She is indeed one of
the higher order of that fraternity; but entirely
newjust initiated. Shall I introduce you, sir?
Depend upon it, you may as well resign your
commission, as decline so fashionable an
acquaintance
.
You'll be thought nothing of, unless
you move in her circle, and you see that she has
nothing but plumes and epaulets in her train.
I feel properly grateful for your kind
intentions
,
sir, answered our hero, smiling at the
singular
manners of the stranger, but you must
excuse me, at present, for declining the honor.
Who are the others in company?
What, the females?You could not propose
a question I can more easily answer. In these
affairs, sir, I am a walking directory. One week
ago those two females were
goddesses
this
evening
they are something less than
women
.
And what has so suddenly reduced them?
Nothing else, sir, but the entrance of a new
character, to whom all worship is now directed.
She on the right, sometimes dashes through
Broadway, driving herself tandum, with a cypher
on her gig very much resembling an L. A certain
great man, who shall be nameless, is said to
employ
many of his leisure moments in studying
Harvey;
and that, you will say, is goodvery
goodexcellent!when I inform you that the
fair Cyprian's name is Sally Harvey. She on the
left, has been a great beauty, and much
caressed
by the higher ranks, but is now also in the
wane, from the cause aforesaid. Her name is
Harrieta very soft, pretty, poetical kind of a
name; but is coupled with one not quite so
smooth, and that is, Stagg. Once moresir, shall
I introduce you? No? Well, then I must bid you
adieu, for they are leaving the Battery, and I am
a satellite you know. Good night.
So saying, this military butterfly flew after the
party, who had just reached the gateleaving our
hero at once amused and surprised at the first
animal of the species he had ever met with.
The day had been sultry, and the sea-breeze
now felt peculiarly refreshing; our hero,
therefore
,
continued to pace the area between the
railing
and the verdant parapet, until the company,
which had been very numerous, gradually
disappeared
,
and he at length found himself in solitude
on this lately thronged promenade. The city
clocks struck eleven, and he reluctantly moved
from the delightful spot. As he turned the north
angle of the parapet, a tall figure stood before
him, in whom he instantly recognized his Mentor
the
Mysterious Chief
. With a respectful
inclination
of the body, George signified his
attention
,
while the chief thus accosted him:
M. C.
Where did we last confer?
George
. On the western bank of the Niagara.
M. C.
What were then my parting words?
You hesitate, but you have not forgotten them.
What was then your promise?
George
. To regulate my future conduct by the
precept you gave me.
M. C.
And have you kept that promise?
George
. I haveas far as my ability extended.
M. C.
You deceive yourself. The banner of
your country again waves over a fortress of your
country's enemy. Why did not your hand assist
to place it there? Why did George Washington
Willoughby desert the standard of Freedom at the
moment she required his services?
George
. Was there not a cause?
M. C.
No evil exists without one. But you
have abandoned the service of your country,
without serving any one. Your duty was plain,
but you neglected to perform it. How is such
conduct to be reconciled to my precept? You
should have performed
your
duty, and trusted to
Heaven for the rest. The
cause
you would plead
is no more a palliation of the fault, than that of the
adulterer or drunkard
It is painful to desist
.
So might the murderer say, and allude to his
thirst for revenge.
George
. And is my journey then a crime?
M. C.
Nobut the
selfishness
which prompted
it, is an enemy to your happiness, and must
therefore
be overcome and reduced to a state of
vassalage
.
Why have you not remembered my
counsel? While you stood on the ground
consecrated
by your brave father's blood, I cautioned
you against suffering a rival to engross those
affections
which were to be devoted to your
country
.
Patriotism, I told you, must rise superior to
all selfish considerations; and I assured you, that
if any object was suffered to stand between you and
dutysuch object should be removed;
for your
country claimed you, and must have you
undivided
entire.
Do you remember this?
George
. I do.
M. C.
Such object
is
removed.
George
. O, pity me, and tell me where.
50*
M. C.
You have this evening been toldand
the devil will utter truths when they promote his
ends.
George
. Then death alone can end my misery.
M. C.
Death cannot deprive you of that
self-love
which is the source of your misery, because
all loves are seated in the soul. Hope not, then,
to find a friend in death, until that enemy is
defeated
.
Learn to act as the
agent
of Providence,
and not as if you were yourself a god. Every
man who acts entirely from himself, without
remembering
(and continually acknowledging with
the heart) from whom he derives the powers of
action, makes himself a god, and commits
profanation
.
This is that forbidden fruit which
destroyed
our race, and the serpent which offers it
is self-love. But be persuaded to shun such
impiety
,
and you may yet be happy.
George
. Happy! and Catharine in the arms of
another! Never!never!
M. C.
Despair is impious, because it is the
annihilation of that confidence in the divine
providence
which Heaven commands us to cherish.
Be a man, and never again lose sight of this
confidence
.
Return to your duty
observe my
counsels
,
and you shall yet defeat a host. If you
strictly adhere to the precepts I have given you,
I pledge the word of him who never lied, that
where your general drives a hundred, you yourself
shall put a thousand to flight; that peace shall
follow your victories, and that happiness shall
wait on peace. Follow my adviceor we meet
no more.
Before George could reply, his Mentor had
disappeared
.
Deeply musing on a promise which
appeared extravagant (if not impossible to be
accomplished
)
our hero departed from the Battery,
and repaired to his lodgings. But sleep was a
stranger to his pillow, and he passed the night in
meditation; the result of which was, a
determination
to return immediately to the army,
commend
Catharine to the care of Heaven,
scrupulously
perform his duty, and throw every care
upon Providence.
Having founded this resolution on a genuine
basis, and applied to the proper source for
assisttance
in keeping it, our hero rose in the morning
with an almost supernatural mental energy, and
immediately commenced his journey to the
frontiers
,
where he arrived on the fifteenth of July.
Here he found a letter from O'Hara, in which the
writer stated that he had, at his own request,
been transferred to the squadron on Lake
Champlain
.
CHAPTER LXIV.
SECRETS WORTH KNOWING.
Wordswordswords.
Shakspeare
.
Sandford
appeared no more on the eastern
side of the river, after betraying Fort Niagara
into the hands of the enemy. Enriched with the
price of his infamy, he felt no inclination for the
duties and privations of a military life, although
offered a lieutenant-colonel's commission in the
British service. He passed the winter at
Kingston
,
dividing his time between Sophia and the
gaming-table, and was so uniformly successful at
play, that in the following spring he found
himself
worth eighty thousand pounds, independent
of the proceeds of his New-England estates. He
now began to think of retiring from business, and
devoting his future hours to luxurious indolence;
but to such a life, the climate of Canada was very
inauspicious; and his whole attention was, for a
long time, vainly employed in determining upon
one more congenial to his wishes.
At length, however, during an excursion to
Quebec, he fell in company and soon became
acquainted with the captain of a private armed
schooner from one of the West-India Islands, who
represented it to be an earthly Eden, and advised
Sandford to proceed thither and purchase a
plantation
,
when he could sink at once into the lap of
ease, and revel in a paradise of sensual delights.
This advice was so consonant to Sandford's ideas
of happiness, that he immediately determined to
adopt it; and finally purchased a share in the
privateer, and struck a bargain with the captain
to convey him to the land of promise.
While the necessary preparations were
making
,
Sandford and Sophia remained at Quebec,
the latter still supporting the character of Reuben.
Being one evening together in a coffee-house,
Reuben pointed out to him an article in a file of
newspapers which they were examining,
commencing
in the following manner:
Quebec, November
4, 1813.
On Friday and Saturday last, the following
American officers were conducted under an
escort of major Bell's volunteer cavalry, from
Beauport, were they were on parole, and lodged
in the jail of this city:
Major C. Van de VenterCaptains John
Machesney,
Henry Fleming
, Alex. M`Ewen,
&c.
A few enquiries at the prison convinced
Sandford
that the father of Catharine was there
confined
;
and, from that instant, he determined upon
the final execution of his long meditated scheme
of stabbing George through the bosom of
Catharine
.
Sophia had declined accompanying him
to the West-Indies; but, for a sufficient reward,
she engaged to furnish Catharine as a substitute!
As a preliminary step to the execution of this
contract, Reuben repaired to the prison, and with
some difficulty obtained an interview with
Fleming
,
to whom he announced himself as a young
drummer, who had just returned from
imprisonment
in the United States, where he had become
acquainted with captain Willoughby, who had
often spoken to him of his friend Fleming's
captivity
.
He had, therefore, taken the first
opportunity
,
on his return to Quebec, to seek him out,
and exert his influence to procure his parole.
During this, and a subsequent interview, it was
found that Fleming had no hope of a speedy
restoration to liberty; that he had just received
a letter from his daughter, the substance of which
he repeated; and that those he had written to his
friends in the United States, had probably been
suppressed, as he had never heard of their
reception
.
With this information, Sophia was ready to
commence her operations. Captain Miller was
easily induced to become an agent in the plot,
and for this purpose proposed to proceed with his
privateer to Long-Island Sound, and there cruise
under the protection of the British blockading
squadron off New-London, while Sandford and
Reuben were to land, and execute a plan they
had digested for getting Catharine into their
power. On arriving in the Sound, however,
Miller
agreed to become a still more active agent,
and with the result of his journey to Ithaca, (
accompanied
by Sophia as his sister) the reader is
already acquainted. The lips of Sandford
received
the kiss which Catharine intended for her
father. The too successful villain sprang from
the sofa, clasped her in his rude embrace, and
for some moments held the insensible sufferer
locked in his unhallowed arms, rifling her pallid
lips of their sweets.
It was so long before this horror-struck girl
recovered from her swoon, that her relentless
persecutor became alarmed for her existence,
fearing that death had deprived him of his
untasted
prey; he therefore rung a bell so furiously
that the old lady was at his elbow in a moment.
Monster! exclaimed she, what have you
done to the poor thing? Why you have frightened
her into a fit. Had you not wit enough to
proceed
gently?
Silence! old hell-cat! vociferated
Sandford
,
in a voice of thunder, and bring me some
sal volatile
, or something else to restore her
breath. Stayshe recoversNow leave the
room!
The old woman obeyed in silence, while
Catharine
slowly opened her eyes, and threw them
wildly round the room. In a moment they rested
on Sandford, and with a dreadful shriek she
darted towards the door, but was caught by the
arm before she reached it.
Not so fast, my lovely Hibernian, said he,
rudely seizing her round the waist. It is a long
time since you and I met in private, and I have
been at a damnable expense to obtain this
interview
.
Do not imagine then that I shall very
readily relinquish you.
O mercy! mercy! exclaimed she, falling
on her knees before the inhuman monster;
Pity a poor friendless orphan, and conduct me
to my dying father.
Make yourself easy on that score,
answered
he with a malicious smile; your father is alive
and well in Quebec. Now reward me for my
good news with another kind kiss.
By what right, sir, do you thus presume to
persecute and insult a poor unfortunate creature,
who has no one near to protect her? Why have
I been thus inveigled away from my friends and
detained against my inclination? Oh! my poor
father! why are you not permitted to protect
your child!
Be calm, lovely girl! replied Sandford;
and permit me to answer your questions by
proposing
a few others. Why was my hand
rejected
with disdain, when I once offered to make you
my wife? Why was I banished from your
presence
in disgrace, and exposed to the vengeance
of your father, for a fault which arose from an
excess of love alone? Why have you
represented
me to your favored lover in a light so odious
as forever to prevent a reconciliation between
us? When you can give a satisfactory answer to
these questions, I may be able to reply to yours.
Your own conscience will answer for me,
replied Catharine, if you will but listen to its
suggestions.
I now repeat my former propositions,
continued
Sandford, Consent to become my wife,
and you shall be immediately restored to your
friends, and your father shall be restored to you.
Detested wretch! exclaimed Catharine,
with an energy and dignity which startled her
inhuman persecutorConsent to become
your
wife! So help me Heaven, I will sooner perish
sooner suffer a death of ignominy, and even
accompany
my father to the scaffold, than so
debase
myself!
Then you must be content to become my
mistress, replied Sandford coolly. You are
caught in my toils, and no power on earth can
rescue you. Say, proud girl! are you content to
succeed the
amiable
and
virtuous
companion of
your journey from Ithaca, and occupy these arms
which have been so long the cradle of Julia
Miller
,
alias
Sophia Palmer? Content you may be,
for to that destiny are you fated, and this moment
shall initiate you into the delicious duties
appertaining
to that honorable office.
Sandford immediately proceeded to put his
threat in execution. Catharine shrieked loudly for
help, and struggled with a strength that astonished
her unfeeling assailant. Her voice was heard in
the street, and the house was soon beset with
watchmen, who threatened to break down the
door unless they were instantly admitted.
Sandford now perceived that not a moment
was to be lost. Catharine had swooned, and he
raised her in his arms, wrapped her in a large
cloak, and conveyed her down a private flight
of stairs into the back yard. Here he was
joined
by his friend Miller, with whose assistance he
bore her down an alley which led to the river,
where a barge was in waiting.
When Catharine recovered from her fit, she
found herself in the arms of Sandford, and
within
half a mile of Hurl-gate, hurried forward by a
fresh westerly breeze, and eight sturdy
oarsmen
.
CHAPTER LXV.
BRILLIANT ACHIEVEMENTS.
Again the warlike trumpet's loud alarms,
Excite to virtuous acts, and manly arms;
While coward Love avows his abject fear
On silken wings sublime he cuts the air,
Scared at the noble noise and thunder of the war.
Rowe's Tam
.
Our
hero stedfastly adhered to his good
resolutions
,
and suffered no consideration to divert
him from the path of duty. Not long after his
return
to the army, a general battle took place on
the peninsula, (near the mighty cataract of
Niagara
,
and within the sound of its terrific thunders)
which continued from five o'clock in the evening
until near nidnight, and terminated in the defeat
of the British army, although their force,
including
Indians, was more than double that of the
Americans.
The action was commenced by the gallant
Scott, with less than two thousand men under his
command, and continued for an hour and forty
minutes before he was supported by the reserve
under Brown. The British were commanded by
general Drummond, seconded by general Riall,
and their advance line was posted in great
strength on a very commanding eminence, near
Lundy's lane. A formidable battery of nine
pieces of artillery (two of which were brass
twenty-four
pounders) occupied the summit of this
eminence, supported by an extensive and heavy
line of infantry. This was the key of the whole
position, and gave the enemy such superior
advantages
,
that it was determined at once to seize
the artillery and occupy the height.
51
This hazardous duty was assigned to the brave
colonel Miller (the hero of Maguaga) who,
perfectly
aware of the mortal perils attending so
desperate
a service, cheerfully replied to his
general
,
I'll try, sir
,
[34]
[34]
See volume i, page 264.
and immediately advanced
with his regiment (seconded by that of the
intrepid
M`Farland) under a most rapid and
destructive
fire, which was poured down upon them from
every piece of artillery, and a heavy line of
musketry
.
M`Farland gallantly fell at the head of
his regiment, and was succeeded in command by
major Brooke, an officer of equal intrepidity and
valor. The undaunted Miller steadily and
silently
ascended the eminence, followed by his eager
countrymen, and after a short but bloody contest
on the summit, succeeded in carrying the whole
battery, drove the British down the hill, and
turned
the fire of their own cannon against them.
In the course of half an hour, however, the
enemy
being strongly reinforced from Fort George,
determined to return to the charge and regain his
artillery. Brown was informed that his broken
corps were rallied, and were advancing in good
order and great force. Doubting the
correctness
of this information, and wishing to
ascertain
the truth, he immediately passed with his
suite in front of the American line, and
discovered
by the faint light of the moon, a more extended
and solid phalanx, than had yet opposed him,
advancing rapidly to the charge. Captain
Spencer
,
without saying a word, put spurs to his horse,
and galloping up to the right of the advancing
line, demanded in a strong and firm voice
What regiment is that?
He was as promptly
answered,
The Royal Scots, sir
. Having
obtained
this information, the daring Spencer
rejoined
his commander-in-chief, who retired with
his suite behind the American line.
The enemy advanced slowly and firmly, while
the most perfect silence was preserved
throughout
the ranks of both armies. The muskets of the
Americans were levelled with a deadly aim, and
the ready lighted matches were suspended over
the well-directed cannon. A general discharge
was received from the advancing foe, and still no
American trigger was pressed, until the assailants
were within twenty paces of their muzzles, when
the word was given to
fire
, and most awful and
tremendous was the effect. The British sustained
their ground as long, perhaps, as ever men stood
such a deluge of destruction, and then retired in
confusion.
Three similar attempts, equally daring,
desperate
,
and unsuccessful, were made by the
exasperated
enemy to regain his cannon; in each
attempt
he was defeated with dreadful slaughter,
and finally relinquished the contest, and retired
beyond the borders of the field, which was thickly
strewed with the dead and wounded of both
armies
.
The Americans being now much exhausted by
fatigue, and faint for want of refreshments, retired
in good order to their camp, while every possible
attention was paid to the wounded of both armies.
Thus terminated the best fought battle which
ever took place on the American continent, in
which the Americans successfully contended with
more than twice their number, drove the enemy
from all his positions, stormed his batteries,
carried
his artillery, and after keeping possession of
the conquered field for three hours, retired to
camp without interruption. All this was
performed
by moon-light, while the hostile lines were
generally within twenty yards of each other, and
frequently so intermingled, that officers would
order an enemy's platoon.
But the loss of the Americans was severe,
being
one hundred and seventy-one killed, five
hundred and seventy-two wounded, and one
hundred
and seventeen missing. The British loss
was eighty-four killed, five hundred and fifty-nine
wounded, and two hundred and thirty-six missing,
one hundred and sixty-nine of whom were taken
prisoners. Among the enemy's wounded were the
generals Drummond and Riallthe latter was
taken prisoner by captain Ketchum of Jesup's
regiment, as was also his aid.
Brown was severely wounded through the
thigh, and in the side. Scott, who had as usual
exposed his person in the most dauntless manner,
was wounded in the right shoulder, and in the left
side; had two horses killed under him, and his
aid, lieutenant Worth, with his brigade major,
Smith, were both wounded by his side. More
than thirty officers of this brigade were killed or
wounded.
The following officers need no eulogium on
their conduct, for they all bear upon their
persons
the most honorable testimony of their
courage
and patriotismwounds, obtained in their
country's service, and which many of them will
carry to their graves: colonels Brady and
Dobbin
;
majors Leavenworth, M`Neill, Jesup, and
Wood; captains Biddle, Foster, Bliss, Pentland,
Foulk, Burbank, and Odell; lieutenants
Campbell
,
Schmuck, J. D. Smith, Worth, Fowle,
Browning, Fisher, Cushman, Hale, Cooper,
Stephenson, Culbertson, Ferguson, Armstrong,
Bean, Shaylor, M`Glassin, Giafford, Vasquez,
Bissel, Cilley, Fisk, Whiting, Ingersol, Tappan,
Abeal, Dietereich, Lamb, O'Fling, Dick, and
Webster; ensigns Thomas, Camp, J. P. Jacobs,
G. Jacobs, Blake, Bedford, Thompson, and
Jones. Captain Pentland and lieutenant
Webster
,
were made prisoners.
In this affair every man did his duty, every
officer
was a hero; and no one was distinguishable
from another, except by their good fortune in
being ordered into situations of peculiar peril.
Of this class were the following: generals Ripley
and Porter; colonels Miller, Dobbin, Nicholas,
Gardner and Wilcox, (the latter commanded the
Canadian volunteers); major Jesup, Hindman,
Jones, M`Ree, and Brooke; captains Austin,
Spencer, Ketchum, and Towson; and lieutenant
Randolph.
Adjutant Poe, major M`Farland, captains
Spencer
,
Ritchie, Hull, Kinney, Goodrich, and
Hooper
;
lieutenants Bigelow, Turner, and Burghard;
and ensign Hunter, all gloriously fell in the
contest
,
and swell the number of those names which
will ever be cherished in the remembrance of
their grateful and admiring countrymen.
The disabled Brown and Scott were conveyed
to Buffalo, while the command of the army
devolved
on the gallant Ripley, until the third of
August, when it was assumed by general Gaines.
In the mean time, the works of Fort Erie were
extended
,
and the original fort much strengthened.
In the foregoing affair, captain Willoughby was
not idle, but conducted himself with his
characterestic
coolness and intrepidity; as he did also
during the subsequent siege of Fort Erie, which
51*
commenced on the third of August, and
continued
until the seventeenth of September;
during
which period the post was assailed in the
most determined manner, and defended with
equal resolutionan almost unceasing
cannonade
being kept up between the besiegers and
besieged. Captain Biddle, lieutenant
Zantzinger
,
adjutant-lieutenant Watmough, and
lieutenant
Patterson, the heroes of many a desperate
conflict, were wounded, among many others, by
the shot and shells thrown from the enemy's
works.
On the morning of the fifteenth of August, the
British made a furious attempt to carry the place
by storm; and for this purpose attacked it at
three points in the same moment, their centre
column
being led by lieutenant-colonel Drummond.
The attack was expected by Gaines; who, not
knowing at what points it would be made,
prepared
to receive it at every one which was
thought assailable. The night was dark and
rainy, but the faithful sentinel slept not, and one
third of the American troops were at their posts.
At half past two o'clock the approach of the
enemy was distinctly heard; and a most
tremendous
fire of cannon and small arms immediately
opened upon him. Three times did he attempt
to mount the walls with scaling-ladders, and was
as often thrown back by the destructive tempest
that was poured upon him from the flaming
batteries.
After the third repulse, Drummond took
advantage
of the extreme darkness of the morning,
(which concealed all his movements from the
view of the garrison) and silently moved his
remaining
troops to an unexpected point, where
he repeated the charge. He ascended the
scaling-ladder
in the midst of his men, who
mounted
with such velocity as to gain footing on the
parapet before any effectual opposition could be
made. Here they were ordered to charge with
pikes and bayonets and
give no quarter!
Captains
Williams and Willoughby, with the brave
lieutenants
M`Donough and Watmough, fought arm
to arm with the assailants, and were all severely
woundedthe gallant Williams, mortally. M`
Donough's
wounds soon rendered him unable to
resist, when Willoughby threw himself before
him, and deeply dyed the sword of Washington
in the blood of his enemies, whom he kept at
bay until the blade snapped in twain, when he
received a cut on his head which threw him on
his wounded friend M`Donough, who now
reluctantly
demanded quarter.
Give no quarter!
exclaimed the tiger-hearted Drummond, and
darted forward to stab the fallen suppliant; who,
seizing a handspike, successfully defended
himself
against a numerous party that now rushed
upon him, until a pistol-shot from the hand of
Drummond terminated his existence. Our hero
had now recovered himself, and regained his
footing on the slippery platform, running with
blood, when seeing the fate of his friend, he
drew forth a pistol and shot his inhuman assassin
through the heart, and then effected his retreat
from the bastion.
The day now began to dawn, and never before
did it rise upon such a scene of human carnage
as this devoted bastion now exhibited. The
contest still continued with augmented fury, and
several desperate but unsuccessful charges were
made on the assailants by the Americans, led on
by the undaunted Birdsall, who was severely
wounded, and compelled to give back, while the
gallant Hindman, Hall and Foster, charged at
different points, with no better success.
A most tremendous assault was, however, just
on the point of being made by four hundred
Americans, who were resolved to turn the tide
of victory, or perish in the attempt, when a
dreadful explosion took place beneath the
platform
of the contested bastion, which destroyed
nearly all the British who occupied it, and at
once decided the fate of the conflict. The enemy
were now in a few moments entirely defeated,
taken, or put to flight, leaving on the field two
hundred and twenty-one killed, one hundred and
seventy-four wounded, and one hundred and
eighty-six prisoners. Fourteen officers were
among the killed, and seven among the prisoners.
The American loss in this affair, was seventeen
killed, fifty-six wounded, and eleven missing.
Among the killed, were the brave captain
Williams
and lieutenant M`Donough. Lieutenant
Watmough defended the contested bastion until
his wounds rendered him incapable of further
resistance; while the gallant Fontaine was thrown
from the walls, and fell into the hands of the
Indians
,
who, unlike their white allies, did not
refuse
quarter to a wounded and yielding foe.
Lieutenants Belknap, Brown, and Bushnell, and
ensign Cisna, were also severely wounded while
gallantly contending with the enemy.
Besides those already mentioned, the following
officers bore a conspicuous part in this desperate
contest, and made a brilliant display of that
chivalric
spirit which so eminently characterises the
American soldier, viz. Generals Ripley and
Porter
;
colonel Aspinwall; majors Trimble,
Hindman
,
Wood, M`Kee, Hall, and Jones; captains
Seymour, Towson, Chunn, Biddle, Fanning,
Foster
,
Boughton, Harding, Birdsall, Marston,
Ropes, and Harris; lieutenants Fraser, Gleason,
Jewitt, Larned, Bowman, Byrd, Riddle, Hall,
Zantzinger, Childs, Douglas, Cushman, Foot,
and Belton; ensigns Benn, Jones, Cummings,
Thomas, Keally, Green, and Blake.
Soon after the above affair, general Brown
was so far recovered of his wounds as to repair
to Fort Erie, and resume the command of the
army, which had been, in the mean time,
reinforced
by new levies of militia. He immediately
conceived a plan for dislodging the enemy from
his intrenched works, and communicated it in
the strictest confidence to the officers of his staff,
who gave it their most cordial approbation.
Fraser
and Riddle, being well acquainted with the
intervening woods, were consulted on the subject
of opening a road through them, by which the
works of the enemy might be assailed from an
unexpected point, and they readily undertook to
open such road in a direction hitherto deemed
the most inaccessible. Accordingly, on the
morning
of the sixteenth of September, they
proceeded
from Fort Erie with a fatigue party, and
penetrated the woods which surrounded the
enemy's
encampment, until they arrived within
pistol-shot
of his works. Here they determined to
commence their operations, and cut their way
back towards the fort. A messenger was
immediately
dispatched to inform Brown, that the
party were in readiness to begin, when a brisk
cannonade was opened upon the enemy's works,
in order to drown the sounds of the American
axes, while the whole party fell to work in felling
trees and filling morasses.
In the course of the day, a convenient road
was constructed, concealed from the enemy's
view only by a little thicket in front of his third
battery; and through this road, on the following
day, did Fraser and Riddle lead the advance of
the assailing columns, with so much rapidity and
secrecy, that the sentinel who was walking to
and fro in the area in front of the battery, was
surprised and slain before any alarm was given,
and the battery was instantly stormed in the most
gallant manner, and the cannon spiked.
Had the attention of the enemy been at all
directed to a point so admirably defended by
nature, the wary assailants might still have
anproached
unobserved; for a stratagem was
adopted
by their advance similar to that recorded by
Shakspeare of Macduff, in his march against the
tyrant of Scotland. Independent of a dress
corresponding to the color of the foliage through
which they proceeded, each man was so
enveloped
by branches stuck in his belt and other
parts of his body, that no semblance of a human
being could have been traced; and the
astonished
foe might have thought, like Macbeth, that a
forest was marching against him.
The assault was made at two points, by two
divisions of the American forcesone of them
commanded by Porter, and the other by Miller;
and with so much bravery and address was the
whole executed, that the British batteries were
all carried, one of his magazines blown up, his
cannon spiked, and above one thousand of his
troops either captured, killed, or desperately
wounded. The Americans lost eighty killed,
two hundred and fourteen wounded, and two
hundred and sixteen missing, which latter were
principally militia who lost their way in the
woods, and were captured after the regulars had
returned in triumph to the fort. The severity of
our hero's recent wounds prevented his sharing
in the glory of this enterprise.
During this brilliant sortie, the following
valuable
officers fell, while galiantly leading their
men to the charge; but their names and
examples
will live to guide the soldier in the path of
duty, so long as true heroism is held in
estimation
:
General Davis, colonel Gibson, and
lieutenant-colonel
Wood; captains Buel, Bradford,
Hale, and Armistead; ensigns O`Fling,
Blakesley
,
Brown, and Belknap.
The following heroes survived the contest, but
their blood has consecrated the soil on which that
conflict was sustained, and enriched it for the
growth of Freedomviz. Generals Ripley and
Porter; lieutenant-colonel Aspinwall; major
Trimble; captains Ingersol, Knapp, Gillet, Hale,
Cobb, Ramsey, and Bigger, (the latter of the
Canadian volunteers); lieutenants Bailey, Grant,
Stephenson, Clark, Hale, Brown, Childs, and
Crawford; ensigns Cummings and Neely. The
ever gallant Fraser, (who was Porter's
brigade-major
,)
received a shot in the leg, while spiking
one of the enemy's cannon, and his friend
Delapierre
,
[35]
[35]
In commemoration of this brilliant achievement, Miller's
regiment
afterwards wore this motto on their buttons
I'll try, sir
.
who was a volunteer aid to the general,
was also severely wounded. The brave Riddle,
with quarter-master Greene, of the volunteers,
as soon as the first battery was carried, descended
into the enemy's magazine, and after securing a
quantity of fixed ammunition, blew up the
magazine
,
and suffered severely from the explosion.
The patriotic conduct of major Hubbard, with
that of fourteen men exempted by age from
military
duty, who voluntarily served under him on
this occasion, will long be remembered by their
grateful country; while the bravery and patriotism
of twenty young gentlemen who volunteered from
Batavia, and followed captain Elliott in this
hazardous
enterprize, will excite an irresistible glow of
emulation in the bosom of every youthful soldier.
But it is impossible to do justice to all who
signalized
themselves on this occasion; it is
sufficient
that I record the names of all that can be
collected, for it will one day be the proudest boast
of many a father to his son, while opening his
tender mind to the sentiments of patriotism and
honor, to conclude his lesson with
Your father
was in the sortie from Erie;
and he will then
mention
with enthusiasm the names I have already
recorded, to which he will add those of Miller,
Ripley, Snelling, Gardner, Beedle, M`Donald,
Upham, M`Bee, Dobbin, M`Burney, Fleming,
Hopkins, Churchill, Crosby, Hall, Jones, Brook,
Chambers, Austen, Lee, Marcle, Wilson,
Lawrence
,
Burr, Dunham, Kellogg, Ganson,
Shortridge
,
Ballard, Dobbins, Bates, and Robinson
all of a rank superior to captain. Also, captains
Hull, Simms, Bradford, Fleming, Parker,
Chatfield
,
Richardson, and Kennedy; together with
lieutenants Lee, Goodall, Ingersol, Livingston,
Bissell, Armstrong, Shore, Kirby, Bridnot, Watts,
Holding, and Davis; and ensign Brant.
On the third day after this brilliant sortie, the
enemy raised the siege, broke up his
encampment
,
hastily retreated towards Fort George, and
rested under the protection of its cannon.
Our hero was still confined with the wounds he
received in the assault of the fifteenth, when the
following letter was handed him from O'Hara:
U. S. Ship Saratoga,
Plattsburgh Bay
,
Sept.
13, 1814.
It is my good fortune, my dear sir, to
announce
that I have for the second time, witnessed
the glorious sight of a whole British fleet
surrendering
to the superior skill and bravery of
American
seamen. Our gallant commodore, M`
Donough
,
will now vie with Perry, while the name of
M`Comb will be coupled with those of Harrison,
Brown, Scott, Boyd, Ripley, Porter, &c. The
eleventh
of September will also shine as bright on
the page of history, as the tenth. But I will
descend
to particulars.
The enemy, for some time past, has exhibited
a disposition to invade the state of New-York, by
the way of Champlain and Plattsburgh; and, on
the first instant, actually entered the former place
with an immense army of veterans (the most of
whom had immortalized themselves in Spain and
France, under lord Wellington) led forward, in
great style, by Prevost and De Rottenberg.
From Champlain they made gradual approaches
towards Plattsburgh, where M`Comb
commanded
52
a small remnant of the right wing of the
American
armythe main body, under Izard, having
been previously ordered to Sacket's Harbor.
On arriving in the vicinity of Plattsburgh, in
full view of the unfinished and half-garrisoned
fortifications of the Americans, the enemy made
a pause, and spent five days in throwing up
breastworks for the protection of his approaches.
All this time, our flotilla lay opposite
Plattsburgh
;
but had Prevost pushed immediately
forward
,
all our exertions could not have saved
M`Comb's little army from destruction. Prevost,
however, was studying a deeper game
considering
that the defeat of this handful of men under
M`Comb as an object of comparative
insignificance
,
he wished to include our squadron in the
victory, and therefore waited all this time for the
British fleet to come up and capture us, while he
conquered the army.
Well, siron Sunday, the eleventh instant,
the British fleet
did
come up, and instantly gave
us battle; while, at the same moment, Prevost
gave battle to M`Comb, on shore. The result
was, that victory crowned the American arms in
both contests; the whole British fleet
is ours
, and
the whole British army (or as many as could effect
their escape) retreated in confusion, leaving their
sick and wounded to the mercy of the victors, and
destroying their stores to facilitate their flight.
Our squadron carried eighty-six guns, and
the British ninety-five. We had fifty-two killed,
and fifty-eight wounded; while they had
eighty-four
killed, (including their commodore,
Downie
)
and one hundred and ten wounded.
The British army, on shore, was
fourteen
thousand strong
, composed of veterans; while
that of the Americans consisted of fifteen hundred
regulars, and less than three thousand raw and
undisciplined militia. The former have lost, in
killed, wounded and missing, about two thousand
five hundred; while the Americans, during the
whole siege, have only lost thirty-seven killed,
sixty-two wounded, and twenty missing.
Insert the following names on your journal,
for they all deserve to be recorded in letters of
gold on columns of marble, for their heroic
conduct
in contending against and defeating the
boasted invincibles of Lord Wellington:
Generals
Mooers and Wright, of the New-York militia;
colonels Smith, Appling, and Miller; majors
Wooll and Totten; captain M`Glassin, Sproull,
Brooks, Vaughan, Scoville, Grosvenor, and
Youngs(the latter commanded a small
detachment
of infantry on board the squadron, acting as
marines); lieutenants Root, De Russy, Trescott,
Smyth, Mountford, Cromwell, Sumpter, Harrison,
Turner, Taylor, and Runk. The four last were
woundedRunk mortally.
Captain M`Glassin had covered himself with
glory two days previous to the battle. With a
small detachment, he forded, at midnight, the
river which separated the two armies, and
attacked
a party of the enemy who were constructing a
strong battery that would have proved very
destructive
to the American ranks; he defeated
them with great loss, destroyed the battery,
spiked
the cannon, and then returned in safety to the
American camp.
On board the squadron, we lost two brave
and valuable officerslieutenants Gamble and
Stansbury; the latter was knocked overboard and
drowned. Your friend John H. Graham, who
immortalized himself in storming the British
batteries
opposite Black Rock, where he lost a leg,
was very active on this glorious occasion; and so
was another young hero, whose name I have often
heard mentioned with admirationI mean
Nathaniel

The following certificate from the gallant Porter, presented to
this patriotic young gentleman when the latter was about to sail for
Europe, is with pleasure recorded in this place:
Towards the close of the siege of Fort Erie, in September, 1814,
Mr. Delapierre visited the American camp, and remained several
days during that critical period, assisting and encouraging the
garrison
in the discharge of its arduous duties At the
sortie
, on the 17th
of September, which terminated the siege, he tendered his services
to me as volunteer aid-de-camp, and acquitted himself with great
gallantry on that occasion, and received a severe wound. So rare an
instance of patriotism and bravery, entitles this young gentleman to
the respect and consideration of every friend to his country.
New-York, July
6, 1815. P. B. PORTER.
On the
present
occasion, he volunteered his services to
M`Donough, and was very conspicuous for his
intelligence
,
activity, and courage.
Besides those I have already mentioned, the
following naval officers also distinguished
themselves
on the glorious ELEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER;
viz. Lieutenants Cassin, Valette, and Duncan
the latter was serving on shore, where he lost an
arm by a rocket; also, midshipmen Monteath,
Williamson, Platt, Thwing, and Baldwin.
Montgomery
received three trifling wounds.
As I concluded the account of Perry's
victory
with an anecdote of a dog, I will conclude that
of M`Donough with an anecdote of a game-cock,
which was on board this ship, the property of
your friend Graham. In the hottest of the battle,
this noble bird flew up the fore hatchway, and
lighted on the ship's bell, where he continued to
crow with all his might, until a cannon ball broke
the bell to pieces. He then flew up into the
rigging
,
and continued crowing until the action
ceased. This incident was hailed by the sailors
as an omen of success, and since the event has
verified
it, the bird is almost worshipped throughout
the squadron. A man might as safely kill one of
the sacred animals of the Hindoos, as to harm
Graham's game-cockan attempt of the kind
would almost raise a mutiny in the fleet.
Have you heard any thing further respecting
Fleming's detention at Quebec, and dare they try
him for treason? Write soon, and tell me
something
of my niece. Adieu.
WILLIAM O'HARA.
After the enemy had been compelled to raise
the siege of Fort Erie, nothing material occurred
during the remainder of the campaign, except an
affair which took place at Lyon's Creek, between
a detachment of nine hundred Americans, under
general Bissell, and eleven hundred British, under
the marquis of Tweedale, in which the latter were
defeated and driven into their intrenchments,
with a loss of nearly two hundred, in killed,
wounded, and prisoners. The American loss
was only twelve killed, and fifty-five wounded.
The action took place on the nineteenth of
October
;
captain Willoughby was engaged in it, and
with so much courage and address as to excite
the admiration of his brethren in arms. The
other officers who distinguished themselves on
this occasion, wereColonels Pinkney, Snelling,
and Pearce; majors Barnard, Barker, and
Grindage
;
captains Dorman, Irvine, and Allison;
lieutenants Horreil, Gassaway, Prestman, and
Anspack.
On the fifth of November, according to
previous
arrangements, Fort Erie was destroyed, and
the American army went into winter-quarters on
the eastern side of the Niagara.

CATHARINE WOODCOCK
.
[INCLOSED IN THE FOREGOING.]
New-Orleans
,
October
4, 1814.
Be happy, my dear mother, for I have good
news to communicate. Our cousin Catharine
Fleming is safe under my protectionthe same
innocent happy being, as when we were romping
together at Ithaca. Pause, while you freely
indulge
the rapturous tears of joy, and then proceed
to particulars.
On the eleventh of September, commodore
Patterson, of the American flotilla on this station,
sailed with a small squadron on an expedition
against a gang of pirates, who have long occupied
an island in lake Barrataria, about thirty miles
from this city, and committed great depredations
on the coastcapturing the vessels of all nations
indiscriminately, and murdering the crews and
passengers. Several vessels from this port, which
were supposed to have been lost at sea, have
increased
the booty of these outlawed wretches. A
detachment of eighty men, under colonel Ross,
also, went down by land, to make a simultaneous
attack, with the squadron, on the rendezvous of
these unprincipled freebooters.
You may perhaps be ignorant that such
a fraternity ever existed in civilized America.
But such is the fact, and in the course of this letter
I shall have occasion to give a brief history of its
leader. Let it suffice, for the present, that the
expedition against them was successfultheir
strong hold was taken, together with all their
armed schooners and feluccas, and a great
quantity
of booty. The captain of this banditti,
monsieur
La Fitte, effected his escape; but
Dominique
,
the second in command, with about one
thousand of his band, were taken prisoners.
On Saturday last, the first instant, I stood on
the levee, with many of the joyful citizens, to
welcome
the victorious Patterson and Ross, on their
return from the successful enterprise; when the
unexpected sight of an elegant female, leaning on
the arm of the colonel, attracted the attention of
every spectator. My curiosity was excited, and
I advancedwhen Catharine sprang forward
uttered my name with a shriekand fainted in
my arms.
The narrow limits of a letter will not allow me
to detail all the particulars of this happy
meeting
the
exclamationssensationsagitations
interrogationsexplanationscongratulations
with my tender bride's commiserationsall these
things must be deferred for verbal
communications
.
In the mean time, however, I will give you
a brief recital of our cousin's peregrinations, since
she parted from youat least, as far as the
agitated
state of her mind has permitted her to
relate
them.
Instead of being conveyed to her sick father,
as she expected to be, she was most
treacherously
betrayed into the power of a wretch who has,
at length, expiated his crimes by death. Her
father
was still a prisoner in Quebec, and the
companions
of her journey were the base minions of
that villainous Sandford who once pretended to
have saved her life at Richmond, and afterwards
insulted her with dishonorable proposals. While
she was fainting with terror, he bore her on
board an English privateer, of which he boasted
of being part owner, having deserted from the
American army, and espoused the British cause.
To what part of the world he intended to
convey her, Catharine could never understand.
as the greater part of the time she was on board
the privateer, she was suffering under a raging
fever, accompanied with fits of raving delirium,
during which she would suffer no one to approach
her but a black boy who waited on the captain.
However severe this additional calamity may
seem, it was probably permitted by Heaven to
secure her from the insults of her abandoned
persecutor
.
On the fifth of August, at about ten o'clock in
the morning, a thick fog, which had hung about
them for more than two days, suddenly broke
away, when they discovered two armed vessels,
under American colors, within musket shot. To
escape was impossible, and the privateer was
therefore cleared for action. A desperate and
sanguinary conflict now took place, which
continued
above three hours, when captain Miller
and his first lieutenant being both slain, the next
officer ordered the British flag to be struck, and
surrendered the privateer as a prize to the two
hostile schooners. She was immediately boarded
from both, and the cowardly Sandford, having
now crawled upon deck, tendered his sword to the
ferocious-looking officer who headed the
boarders
.
The weapon was received, and instantly
thrust through the wretched prisoner's heart, who
fell lifeless on the deck. This was the signal
for an indiscriminate slaughter, and every man
belonging to the privateer soon floated a
breathless
corpse in the deep. The black boy alone
escaped, who concealed himself in the hold, and
on being discovered after the massacre, was
permitted
to live.
Fortunately for Catharine, she was
insensible
to all these dreadful transactions, and
learned
them afterwards from the boy. On
recovering
her recollection, she found herself in bed on
shore, with a black woman and the boy
watching
by her pillow, who both testified the most
lively joy, on hearing her speak in a calm and
rational manner. Her fever was now broken,
but she was extremely weak, and it was several
days before her physician, who was also black,
would allow her to converse, although she was
laboring with the most painful curiosity to learn
the particulars of her situation. At length,
however
,
her nurse was permitted to answer her eager
inquiries, who informed her, with the greatest
caution, that she was on an island called
Barrataria
,
which was occupied by a band of outlaws,
who had declared war against a world that had
discarded them, and lived by committing
depredations
on the property of every nation without
distinction. In a word, Catharine found herself
a prisoner among a band of the most daring
pirates
that ever infested the ocean;who, within
thirty miles of New-Orleans, were in the habit of
capturing vessels, bound to and from that port,
and murdering every person on board, to prevent
a discovery.
Disagreeable as this information was to
Catharine
,
it was not so dreadful as her
compassionate
attendants had apprehended. She was out of
the power of Sandford, and every other situation
was comparatively happy. Besides, should her
health be restored, she did not despair of
prevailing
on the chief to send her to New-Orleans,
as he was represented to her as a paragon of
generosity and magnanimitya second Charles
de Moor.
Catharine's health gradually returned, and
she had so far recovered her strength as to be
able to walk, when she was one day honored with
a visit from Monsieur La Fitte himself; who,
after politely congratulating her on the partial
restoration of her health, begged her to inform
him in what manner he could serve her.
By conveying, or sending me to
New-Orleans
,
was Catharine's reply.
Were such a step compatible with my own
safety, answered he, I would not hesitate a
moment
.
But, madam, consider what a risk I should
incur by such a step. A price is set upon my
head by the governor of Louisiana, and several
fruitless attempts have already been made to
earn the reward; therefore am I obliged, in
self-defence
,
to destroy instead of preserving my
prisoners. Do your friends reside in
New-Orleans
?
Alas! no, sirthey are far distant. But if
I can once breathe my sorrowful story to a
christian
ear, I shall find protection until I can write to
my friends, who must be wretched at my
mysterious
disappearance.
Mysterious disappearance? said La Fitte;
Although my mode of life, madam, is not such as
can command a christian's confidence, still, if you
will consent to entrust your sorrowful story to my
ear, I pledge you the word of a soldier that you
shall never repent the condescension.
Catharine was willing to conciliate the being
in whose power she had been so providentially
placed, and therefore complied with his request,
and related all the particulars which were
necessary
to make him acquainted with the nature of
her extraordinary and forlorn situation. When
she had finished, La Fitte exclaimed---
Who shall say, then, that we are not the
legal
ministers of Heaven's eternal justice! My
hand slew the scoundrel you describe, and
avenged
the load of wrongs he has heaped upon you.
I now pledge myself that you shall be conveyed
in safety to New-Orleans the first favorable
opportunity
.
In the mean time rest confident of my
protection, and the respectful attentions of all
whom I command. I will now repay your
confidence
by relating some particulars respecting
my own history, and that of our fraternity, with
which the world are little acquainted.
I once held a commission under Bonaparte,
in whose victorious army I was a captain of no
inconsiderable reputation; and, but for one
unfortunate
circumstance, should probably have
arisen to an elevated grade. The circumstance
to which I allude will not interest you, and I shall
therefore pass it over in silence. Let it suffice
that I felt myself injured, and consequently
resigned
my commission and emigrated to America.
I landed in this country with a proud spirit, and
no adequate funds to support my dignity.
Being
an expert swordsman, I opened a fencing
school in New-Orleans, for a livelihood, and
acquired
considerable celebrity in the profession.
During the troubles in St. Domingo, a vast
number of the inhabitants took refuge in Cuba;
and when the late war between France and Spain
commenced, they were compelled to leave that
island, with the short notice of a few days.
Without
ceremony they entered the United States, and
most of them the state of Louisiana, with all the
slaves they had possessed in Cuba. They were
notified by the governor of this state of the clause
in the constitution which forbade the importation
of slaves; but at the same time, received the
assurance
of his excellency that he would obtain, if
possible, the approbation of the general
government
for their retaining this property.
I will not weary your patience with
particulars
.
I was not born for the dull pursuits of
civil
lifemy soul always aspired to lead an army,
but fate had forever blasted my hopes of military
glory. My fellow-beings had treated me with
ingratitude
and indignity, and I now declared war
against the whole despicable race. Sufficient
materials were at hand for the execution of my
scheme. Those very emigrants who had been
hospitably received by the citizens, and highly
favored by the government of their adopted
country
,
repaid this kindness by the blackest
ingratitude
,
which convinced me that they were
sufficiently
base for my purpose. I soon collected a
numerous band, and in 1811, strongly fortified
this island, which is as remarkable for its health
and fertility as for the delicious fish with which its
waters abound. I have continued here ever since,
with a formidable squadron at my command,
which has more than once compelled the United
States flotilla to retreat; I have, also, a large
military
force, and have dealt out large measures of
vengeance against the perfidious race whose
base ingratitude drove me to this extremity. The
strictest subordination exists in the island, both
among my military and naval subjects, who all
fear me for my courage, and love me for the
liberality
with which I relinquish to them my share
of the booty we capture. The prince regent of
53
England cannot boast the same, or he would have
fewer enemies among his own subjects.
About a year ago, the governor of Louisiana
advertised a reward of
five hundred dollars
for
my head, which pitiful offer I immediately
answered
by promising a reward of as many
thousands
for the head of his excellency, and my
advertisements
were posted on every corner in the city of
New-Orleans. A company (commanded by a man
who had once been my intimate friend) was
ordered
out to attack me here on my island, and
was suffered to approach very near before I chose
to make a display of our forces; when, on a
signal
given, he instantly found himself surrounded
by a numerous host of armed men, who
suddenly
emerged from the secret avenues which lead
into this bayou. And in what manner do you
imagine
that I treated this man, who came to destroy
my life and all that makes life desirable to me?
I treated him, madam, as became La Fitte, the
Great Bandit of BarratariaI spared his life
offered him that which would have made the
honest
soldier comfortable for the remainder of his
days, (which was nobly and indignantly refused)
and I then permitted him to return, with his
company
,
in safety to the city.
His excellency was now convinced that we
were too strong to be taken by land, and my navy
has hitherto been larger than that which the
government
has kept on this station.
After again assuring Catharine of his
protection
,
and promising to find her a conveyance
to this city, the generous pirate took his leave.
It was but a few weeks after this conference, that
his boasted army and navy were all captured by
the gallant Patterson and Ross.
And now, my dear mother, adieu for the
present
.
Your lovely daughter-in-law desires to be
remembered with affection, and you may expect
to embrace us all by the first of February.
D. WOODCOCK.
CHAPTER LXVII.
THE CONCLUSION.
Now have the happy lovers met,
Now Fate to Virtue pays her debt;
And, for their troubles, bids them prove
A lengthened life of peace and love.
Scottaltered
.
The
northern army was now idle, in
winter-quarters
,
and a furlough, at this time, could not
interfere with our hero's duty. He found no
difficulty in obtaining one, and set out
immediately
for New-Orleans, where he arrived about
the middle of December, and once more met the
happy Catharine.
The inhabitants of New-Orleans were in a
state of alarm and consternation, being in almost
daily expectation of the arrival of a formidable
expedition, which had been fitted out by the
British
for the express and avowed purpose of
reducing
that city, and taking possession of the
whole territory of Louisiana. In consequence
of this impending danger, the city was declared
to be under strict martial law, by general
Jackson
,
who was busily employed in making
arrangements
for its defence. On the eighteenth, he
reviewed
the militia of the city, which were in a
few days joined by about four thousand
Tennessee
and Kentucky troops, detachments of which
were immediately posted in different directions to
guard the defences of the city. Our hero now
volunteered his services to Jackson, in any
capacity
the general preferred, who thereupon
appointed
him one of his aids.
Commodore Patterson dispatched five
gunboats
,
under lieutenant Jones, to a favorable
position for watching the approach of the enemy,
who at length made his appearance, and after a
desperate conflict, succeeded in capturing this
flotilla. The hostile squadron consisted of
sixty
sail
, mostly of the line, on board of which was
an army of
sixteen thousand regular troops
, under
the command of Sir Edward Pakenham,
brother-in-law
of the Duke of Wellington.
As soon as his advance had captured the
American
flotilla, the enemy landed a division of five
thousand men, under major-general Keane, some
miles below the city, whose progress, however,
was speedily and effectually checked by about
two thousand backwoodsmen and city militia.
After this action, both armies continued to
throw up works, with little interruption, until the
twenty-eighth, when Pakenham, having landed
the reserve of his army, commenced throwing
bombs and rockets in a most vigorous and
tremendous style, at the same time gradually
advancing
towards the American line. He was at
length, however, compelled to retreat to his
works with great loss. On the first of January,
he made a similar attack with no better success.
Early on the morning of the eighth, Pakenham
led forward twelve thousand regulars and two
thousand seamen, who approached the American
works in two columns, under Generals Gibbs and
Keane, supported by a reserve, under general
Lambert. They advanced in the most
determined
manner, against a destructive fire, with
scaling ladders and fascines, determined to storm
Jackson's unfinished batteries, and push forward
to the city. But the American fire was too hot
it swept them from right to left, and compelled
them to recoil in confusion. The most active
efforts were immediately made to rally the
disordered
columns, and bring them up to a second
charge; in this act Pakenham was killed; and
though Gibbs and Keane succeeded in pushing
their divisions forward, the second effort was no
more fortunate than the first. Gibbs and Keane
were both severely wounded, the former mortally;
and the only general officer left on the field was
Lambert, who, after vainly attempting to rally
the attacking columns, succeeded in withdrawing
them from the field, and before the eighteenth
the expedition was abandoned, and the whole
army had evacuated the shore.
Jackson was now hailed as the saviour of the
city; and the distinguished part which our hero
took in this brilliant defence, drew upon himself
also no small share of public honor and applause.
The following officers also immortalized their
names by their conduct on this occasion:
Generals Coffee, Carrol, Adair, Morgan,
Villere
,
Humbert, and De Flanjac; colonels
Anderson
,
Perry, Haynes, Butler, Ross, M`Rea,
Savary
,
and De Laronda; majors Hinds, Planche,
Dagwin, Pierre, Catard, Kevanaugh, La Tour,
Carmac, Peyre, St. Geme, La Coste, Daquin,
Chotard, Davis, Hampton, and Tatum; captains
Reid, Baker, Humphrey,Beal,Ogden, Livingston,
53*
M`Mahan, Pace, Lefevre, Planchard, Smith, and
Griffin; lieutenants Spotts, Kerr, Alexis,
Cromford
,
and Leach; also, the generals' aid
Willoughby
,
Livingston, Duplissis, Davizac, De
Castra
,
Duncan, Butler, and Grymes; together with
doctors Kerr and Flood, and Messrs. Cheanveau,
Hiriart, La Trobe, Gilbert, Bosquet, Decoin, and
the Mexican field-marshal Don Juan de Anavar.
General Villere's son first gave information of the
enemy's landing, and was afterwards made
prisoner
.
Colonels Platt, Dyer, Gibson, Elliott,
and Lauderdale, were woundedthe latter
mortally
.
Major Nicks and lieutenant Dupuy, were
also wounded, and major Kavenaugh was made
prisoner.
Of the flotilla, the following officers
distinguished
themselves: Commodore Patterson,
captain
Henley, lieutenants C. C. B. Thompson,
Norris, Crowlie, and Grawlie; sailing-master
Johnson, master's-mate Livingston, and
Midshipman
Watkins; also purser Shields, and a Mr.
Walker.
Previous to the battle of the eighth, the pirates
of Barrataria, who had been held in custody,
were released by order of general Jackson, upon
condition that they would assist in defending the
city. In this battle they proved themselves
excellent
artillerists, and were very serviceable,
particularly two of their naval captains
Dominique
and Belluche. They all afterwards received
a full pardon from the president of the United
States, for their good conduct on this occasion.
To their wounded enemies, the citizens of
New-Orleans
paid every possible attention; in which
duty the nuns of the Urseline convent took the
glorious lead. Under the immediate
superintendance
of the Abbe Douburg, they threw open
their doors, and converted all their houses, except
the main building, into hospitals, where the
charitable
sisters, at their own expense and with
their own hands, took care of the sick and
wounded. The ladies of New-Orleans were also
employed in the same godlike acts of
benevolence
,
in which Catharine and her lovely new
cousin, liberally assisted.
In a few days after this brilliant affair, our hero,
Catharine, young Woodcock, and his blushing
bride, set out for New-York, where they arrived
on the twentieth of February. Here he met his
father, Fleming, and Fleming's agent, Dobson,
who had just returned from the East Indies, with
an immense fortune, and made ample restitution
to the man he had defrauded.
George led his Catharine to the Altar of
Hymen
,
on the very day that the ratification of the
treaty of PEACE was celebrated in the city of
New-York. The new married couple then
accompanied
their cousin Woodcock and his bride
to Ithaca, where they arrived in season to
receive
the blessing of his dying mother. As soon
as the funeral obsequies were over, George,
Catharine
,
and Fleming, accompanied major
Willoughby
to Boston, where they passed the
remainder
of the winter and the following spring;
enjoying
,
in the society of their friends, the purest
felicity that mortals ever tasted on earth. The
next summer the two fathers returned to their
estates in Ohio, which were soon restored to their
former beauty; and there, with our hero and his
Catharine, they both still reside, ever ready to
give the reader a cordial welcome, whenever he
or she will make a journey to Mulberry-Grove.
Sophia shone a few months in the circles of
vice, and in the following winter fell a victim to
disease. She ended her wretched existence in
the New-York Hospital, invoking curses on
herself
and all mankind. Her unfortunate husband
had died of a broken heart, shortly after her
elopement.
Our hero's Boston friends are all still living,
prosperous and happyMorse and Orville have
each of them a son and a daughter. O'Hara is
now sailing-master in the navy, and the
achievements
of Logan are celebrated by the Bards of
the Forest. Woodcock and his lovely wife, are
enjoying in Ithaca all the happiness that their
virtues merit.
Our hero had now completed his

As George recorded the last sentence, he raised
his eyes in extacy, and discovered the
Mysterious
Chief
at his elbow, who thus accosted him:
You have at length become all I can wish
you have adhered to my precepts, and defeated a
host of internal foes that were more dangerous to
your peace than the British were to your country.
You have conquered the former, by the assistance
of Heaventhe latter were defeated by me, as
the instrument of Heaven.
George

you!
M. C.
Yes, by me.
George
. What then am I to think of you?
M. C.
Think of me as an
ALLEGORY
and let it be recorded in your journal, that it is
the duty of every parent to believe that his
children
are
specially
destined by Heaven for a life
of
peculiar usefulness
in order that he may be
thereby induced to prepare them for such a life.
I repeatthat, as the instrument of Heaven, I
achieved every victory which graces your

Americans
would succeed, either in peace or war, their
counsels must be actuated and their heroes
inspired

THE END.Mulberry-Grove, Ohio
,
October
22, 1812.
Your
last, my son, is now before me, and
every sentence yields me pleasure, except that in
which you mention Amelia's fears on my account.
Assure her from me, that the moment any real
cause of alarm presents itself, I shall not be
backward
in providing for the safety of myself and
those under my protection. It grieves me that
she should make herself unhappy in anticipating
evils that may never arrive. Let me intreat her,
through you, to banish every fear for the safety
of her father, and repose her trust in that
merciful
Being who, in the operations of his
providence
,
never permits an evil to take place but for
the ultimate good of his creatures; and it is our
duty to submit without a murmur. I do not wish
it to be understood that the ordinary human
means of shunning an impending danger are to
be neglected: so far from it, I should conceive
that I was tempting the Almighty, to remain in a
place of danger, when I could retreat
consistently
with duty. I repeat, that I will remove from
Mulberry-Grove the moment I apprehend any
27*
danger from staying. Were it a tenable fortress,
the case would be different. Let this assurance
restore peace to the bosom of my child.
I have just received an account of the
unprofitable
contest at Queenston, and I lament to
add, that your brother George is again a prisoner
of war. A letter from Lewiston assures me that
my noble boy behaved in a very gallant manner
throughout the whole affair, and this in some
measure
reconciles me to his renewed captivity. I
received a letter from him while at Buffalo,
giving
an account of the fortunate enterprize which
restored him to liberty, with above thirty others,
only five days before the Queenston affair; but
as you must already be in possession of the
particulars
,
perhaps from his own pen, I shall pass
them over unnoticed.
You wish me to continue a regular detail
of war events on the western frontier. Indeed,
you enjoin on me a hard task; for the situation of
Mulberry-Grove is not the most eligible for a
political
observatory. I am sometimes indebted to
a Boston newspaper for accounts of events
passing
in this state. But I will comply with your
request
as far as practicable, and give you a brief
account of every interesting occurrence in the
order I receive them.
On the nineteenth of September, general
Harrison, pursuant to orders from the war
department
,
relinquished the command of the
Northwestern
army to brigadier-general Winchester, a
gentleman of great respectability and merit, but
who does not appear to possess the confidence of
the Kentuckians like Harrison. Great discontent
and murmuring were produced among the troops
when they were informed of the change; but on
being addressed by Harrison, they appeared
better
satisfied. An express from the seat of
government
,
however, has since reached him, with
dispatches from the same department, appointing
him to the command of all the troops which have
been called into service from the western states.
He has, therefore, again taken the command of
the Northwestern army, and, it is expected, will
immediately adopt the most efficient measures to
regain Detroit and proceed into Upper Canada.
Among the volunteers from Kentucky, now
under Harrison, are the following members of
congress: Samuel Hopkins, major-general;
Richard
M. Johnson, commanding a battalion of
mounted rangers; John Simpson, captain;
William
P. Duval, captain; Samuel M`Kee, private;
Thomas Montgomery, private. To the honor of
that patriotic state, I can also add, that numbers
of the most wealthy and respectable private
citizens
are in the ranks, who endure all the
privations
necessarily attendant on a military life, with
a degree of subordination never exceeded by
regular
troops.
During the attack on Fort Wayne by the
Indians
,
mentioned in my last, it is said that the
commander, captain Rhea, proposed to
surrender
;
but his subalterns threatened to put him to
instant death if he made the proposition again.
It was supposed he intended to surrender the fort
and make his escape to Detroit. The moment
general Harrison arrived, captain Rhea was
arrested
,
and given liberty to resign, or to stand his
trial. He chose the former. The firmness of
these officers, no doubt, saved the garrison from
indiscriminate massacre.
Some particulars respecting another
expedition
against that post, have just come to my
knowledge
.
About the middle of September, two
Indians
arrived at Detroit with a letter, which they
found on an express whom they had intercepted
and killed, and which had been sent by the
commander
of Fort Wayne to general Harrison,
requesting
succors, and stating that his situation
was critical. The British commander, on the
receipt
of the letter, immediately sent about
one
thousand Indians
, who had arrived at Detroit
since its surrender, with a few regulars, to attack
the fort; who proceeded until they came within
sixteen miles of an American army, which they
learned, from a prisoner their spies took, to be
Harrison's. They then precipitately retreated,
leaving much of their ammunition, &c. on the
ground.
Harrison, I understand, is now employing
himself with the greatest zeal, in arranging
depots
of provisions, clothing, and ammunition;
opening roads, building boats, erecting
block-houses
,
&c. preparatory to his march to the
borders
,
whither he shortly proposes to proceed.
Several of the Miami and other Indians have
come in to him, and thrown themselves on the
mercy of the government, agreeing to abide by
the decision of the president in relation to them,
whatever that may be.
The accounts from Detroit are not very
agreeable; almost every day furnishes instances
of dishonorable conduct in British officers, who
openly and shamefully violate the articles of
capitulation
.
The inhabitants are daily plundered
of their private property, and robbed of every
thing to which their haughty oppressors take a
liking. But the barbarities of the Indians are
shocking beyond belief; even the sanctity of the
tomb is violated, and dead bodies have been
unearthed
and stripped of their scalps, which these
unprincipled wretches have then sold to their
more unprincipled employers; thus at once
robbing
the dead and cheating the living! The
British
have almost disrobed Detroit of every thing
valuable, and carried it within their lines. They
have no expectation of being able to hold the
place, and are therefore removing the cannon and
ammunition. The fort is now garrisoned by one
hundred British regulars.
I can now positively and safely contradict
the report that I hinted at in my last, of the
defeat
and massacre of a detachment from general
Perkins' command at the river Huron. The
circumstances
,
which I have since learned, and
which may be depended upon, are as follows:
General Perkins had detached captain Cotton,
with a party of ninety men, to the peninsula of
Sandusky, to secure some salt said to be there.
On the arrival of the party, they discovered some
Indians, whom they immediately attacked; the
Indians retired until they were joined by another
party, when a brisk fight took place; and had it
not been for some misunderstanding of the orders,
it is probable the whole of the Indians would
have been killed or taken, as the Americans had
outflanked and nearly surrounded them. It is,
however, satisfactory to add, that the Indians
were beaten; and, though the number killed
could not be correctly ascertained, there is no
doubt but their loss greatly exceeded ours, which
was six killed and ten wounded, none of them
dangerously. Captain Cotton has returned to
camp.
Captain Elliott is making great exertions to
secure the command of Lake Erie, for the
attainment
of which important object a great number
of ship-carpenters are put in requisition. May
Heaven crown their labors with success, and
make them instrumental in restoring a speedy
peace.
You request some further observations on
the subject of war, and seem not to be entirely
satisfied with my attempts to reconcile it with
religion
.
Perhaps you do not sufficiently keep in
view the ground on which I found my argument
viz.
the present degenerate state of man
. Evil
is
in the world; how it gained a footing here, does
not belong to the present subject. It is sufficient
for my purpose to know, that all the operations
of Providence tend to its removal; it was for this
purpose alone that revelation was given, and it is
for this purpose alone that wars, pestilences,
famines
,
&c. are permitted to ravage the earth.
There never were but two ways or methods
by which the operations of Providence have been
carried on: the one by extraordinary, the other by
ordinary means; the former may be termed
miracles
the
latter, natural occurrences. Miracles
have long since ceased, because they interfere
with the free will of man, forcing an
acquiesence
from the understanding, without reforming
his heart. The only possible manner, then, in
which evil can be gradually removed from the
world, (consistently with that freedom of will
which makes us men) is by spiritual
instruments;
and, as it would be out of order for good spirits to
be employed in such dirty work, and as evil
spirits
always stand ready to do such work, the
Almighty
permits them, under proper restraints, to
stir up nation against nationset the great
cauldron
boiling, and take the scum for their trouble.
But you will ask, if the removal of evil is all
that is intended in the permission of wars,
pestilences
,
famines, and the rest, how happens it that
the good suffer equally with the bad?
To this I answerThe good are permitted
to be thus afflicted in order to make them still
better
,
by increasing their patience, humility, and
dependence on Heaven. And when they are
finally removed from this life by one of these
same
instruments
, they enter into a state of
never-ending
felicity, where these instruments can no
more reach them or afflict them. With the
wilfully
wicked the case is different; by permitting
them to be cut off, the hereditary love of evil
which they derived from their parents, (and which,
instead of combatting and subduing, they have
increased by unrestrained indulgence) is thus
arrested
and prevented from descending to a
numerous
progeny, who might in their turn
transmit
the accumulated load to the next generation,
until the world would be again reduced to that
state which once caused its destruction by a
deluge
.
But, admitting all this, you may then ask
How can good men conscientiously assist in this
work of devils, for the performance of which
there are, alas! too many instruments instigated
by passions altogether suitable for the diabolical
employment?
This brings us to the main point of the
subject
,
and will lead me to notice a very nice
distinction
.
No good man can, conscientiously and
voluntarily
,
take up arms in an
offensive
war, unless
he do so to prevent the still greater evil of
disobeying
those in authority, (which we are
expressly
forbidden by religion to do) and thereby
promote civil dissentions. But in a war
altogether
defensive
, like the one in which we are now
engaged, every good man, I believe, may safely
take a part, and do so from the purest motives. I
must insist upon it, that in our present low state
of goodness, means correspondingly low must be
resorted to, to defend our just and unalienable
rights. Were we without sin, other means would
doubtless be provided by Providence; as we are
not, we have no right to expect them. It is
surely
justifiable self-defence to strike a weapon from
the hand of an assailant; or, if that weapon is
raised against us, to strike off the arm that wields
it. Canada is that armthe Indian scalping
knife is the weapon it wields. If we cannot
repel
the weapon, let us attempt to cut off the arm.
I have already given you the substance of a
conversation I once had on this subject with
general
Brown, before he had entirely discarded
the prejudices of the sect in whose tenets he was
educated. He was then a quaker, and I believe
a most excellent man; nor is he the less so for
being now in the field, ready to chastise the
enemies
of freedom. It is possible that some
people
might draw from that conversation a mistaken
inference, and imagine that I was combatting
the principle of peace itself, when I was only
contending against the enthusiastic delusions
which men have fallen into by mistaking the
genuine
sense and meaning of our religion. If a
Millenium is ever to bless the world, or the
Saturnian
age to return, I am confident that it will
not be brought about exclusively by Quakers;
it must be effected by a radical change and
reform
in the heads and hearts of mankind. When
such a reform becomes so extensive as to find its
way into our political bodies, its effects will be
exhibited in the sphere of politics. Politicians
will then forget all party distinctions, and the
friends of peace will discard that enthusiasm
which assumes credit for ideal virtues that
cannot
be practised. They will be men on a
proper
level with the business of the world in which
they live, and, therefore, Christians, truly sane
and efficient.
The Quakers all profess to be the disciples
of
Peace
; and, in order not to be mistaken by
the world on this point, have assumed a peculiar
garb, speech, and manners. But is it not highly
probable that many among them may be merely
externally
friends; men who indulge their
unbridled
passions in the political contests around
them, their bosoms burning like a fiery furnace,
with every malignant and furious passion that is
common to the wicked? If there are such, what
will the external garb of peace avail them, while
they have no peace within? What can avail the
cut of their coat, the nicety of their grammar, or
the peculiarity of their calendar? To such I would
say, Assume the military uniform of your
country
;
in that character you may become useful;
let your furious passions, your subtle selfish
cunning
,
operate against the open enemies of your
country, rather than expend their malignant
influence
on your neighbors and fellow-citizens. Ye
are cut-throats internallyyou may as well be
so externally: your damnation would not be
more certain.
28
The creed or discipline that gives no
latitude
for the exercise of private judgment, is a
wrong one; for the soul that is panting for war,
should no more be restrained by the discipline of
his sect from taking the field, than one of a
contrary
disposition should be compelled to go into
it. The man who shoulders his musket
conscientiously
,
may be a faithful christian. The man
who cheerfully pays others because he thinks
that they are fitter than himself, by nature or
education
,
for such purpose, may also be a good
christian. The quakers say, he only who resists
not, but trusts to Heaven for protection, is a good
christian.
Whatever be a man's religious or political
creed, if he be honest and peaceable,
uncontroled
by selfish interests, prejudice, and bigotry, an
observer of the golden rule, and a lover of
usefulness
every
good christian ought to hail him
as a brother, whether his coat be
drab
or
scarlet
whether he has conscientiously taken up arms,
or conscientiously refused to take up arms.
The sect of the quakers tacitly declare to all
others,
you must join, or fight for us
. Now, it
may happen, and indeed does actually happen,
that very many do not approve of the creed and
discipline of the quakers; the option then seems
to be rather a hard one, and inconsistent with the
general principles of justice; for if, in order to
avoid war, we go into society, we must violate
conscience; if we do not go in, but go out to war,
we are reprobated as anti-christians, even when
fighting their battles, which they unjustly refuse
to do; so that we appear in a dilemma, from
which there are no means of release but in
breaking
down the creed itself.
When we speak of a man trusting in Heaven
for protection, we should always think of a
protection
according to the proper and regular order
established by law, not in an imaginary state of
things, taking rise in delusions. On this point
we have an excellent lesson from Scripture, where
Satan, by an
affectation
of such a trust, desires
the Redeemer to cast himself from the pinnacle
of the temple; the reply to which should be
always
present to every christian, for it expressly
forbids us thus to
tempt
the Almighty, by any
improper
or eccentric departure from the
established
order even of external or natural things.
The true state of the case is this: when the
necessity for war shall cease, then war will cease,
and not before; for whilst there are bad men to
commit aggressions, the best of men must defend
themselves, and by carnal weapons too, if
necessary
.
A contrary doctrine is just as absurd as
for a shepherd to go home with his dog, and trust
to Providence to protect the sheep, when
surrounded
by wolves.
But I shall trespass on your patience, and
therefore adieu for the present.

The Hon.
Paul Hamilton
,
Sir
I have the honor to inform you, that on
the 25th inst. being in the lat. 29 N. long. 29, 30,
W. we fell in with, and, after an action of an hour
and an half, captured his Britannic Majesty's ship
Macedonian, commanded by captain John
Carden
,
and mounting forty-nine carriage guns (the
odd gun shifting.) She is a frigate of the largest
class, two years old, four months out of dock, and
reputed one of the best sailors in the British
service
.
The enemy being to windward, had the
advantage of engaging us at his own distance,
which was so great, that for the first half hour we
did not use our carronades, and at no moment
was he within the complete effect of our
musketry
and grapeto this circumstance and a heavy
swell, which was on at the time, I ascribe the
unusual length of the action.
The enthusiasm of every officer, seaman and
marine on board this ship, on discovering the
enemy
their
steady conduct in battle, and
precision
of their fire, could not be surpassed. Where
all met my fullest expections, it would be unjust
in me to discriminate. Permit me, however, to
recommend to your particular notice, my first
lieutenant, William H. Allen.
[5]
[5]
See vol. i. p. 75.
He has served with
me upwards of five years, and to his unremitted
exertions in disciplining the crew, is to be
imputed
the obvious superiority of our gunnery
exhibited
in the result of the contest.
Subjoined is a list of the killed and wounded on
both sides. Our loss, compared with that of the
enemy, will appear small. Amongst our
wounded
you will observe the name of lieutenant Funk,
who died in a few hours after the actionhe was
an officer of great gallantry and promise, and the
service has sustained a severe loss in his death.
The Macedonian lost her mizen-mast, fore and
main-top-masts and main yard, and was much cut
up in her hull. The damage sustained by this ship
was not such as to render her return into port
necessary
,
and had I not deemed it important that
we should see our prize in, should have
continued
our cruise.
With the highest consideration and respect, I
am, sir, your obedient humble servant.

MY DEAR BOY,
Yours
of the fifteenth December came
duly to hand, and has yielded me indescribable
pleasure. The unparalleled achievements of
our gallant sailors, must convince every man, not
blinded by prejudice, of the importance of a
respectable
naval establishment. This is a point
to which the strength and resources of our
country
can be directed with advantagewith honor
with complete success. Congress will become
convinced of this without a very long study in
that
dear school
you speak of.
O'Hara arrived here, after a journey of
twenty
days. The unexpected meeting had like to have
proved as fatal to his affectionate sister, as the
report of his death proved to his poor debilitated
father. His return has dressed the whole family
in smiles, which are at times, however, a little
overclouded by his expressing a determination
to enter on board the squadron, which is to be
established on Lake Erie.
When I wrote you last, every thing in the
Northwest was going on prosperously, and I had
no doubt but that my next would contain the
pleasing
intelligence of Harrison having recovered
all that Hull lost. But my present task is a less
pleasing one, for I am to announce a disaster,
which will long be felt and mourned by our
bleeding
country.
I think I told you, in my last, that the army
was proceeding from Fort Defiance towards the
Lake; but I forgot to mention a previous
circumstance
which I know will be interesting to
you
,
and which shall therefore be noticed in this place.
It is in some measure connected with the event I
allude to, and you will come to the melancholy
catastrophe soon enough.
Ever since the commencement of hostilities,
our old friend Logan (whom Hull, in his official
despatch represented as an enemy) has been
very solicitous to espouse the cause of the United
States,
[9]
[9]
In General Hull's official communication to
the Secretary of
War, giving his reason for surrendering Detroit
with the army to the
enemy, he says, Among the vast number of
chiefs who led the
hostile bands, Tecumseh, Marplot,
Logan
, Walk-in-the-water,
Split-Log
,
etc. are considered theprincipals.
notwithstanding the flattering offers of
the British, which he had uniformly rejected and
spurned with contempt. Several other chiefs
who were wavering, and stood ready to lead
their followers to either standard, as
circumstances
might invite, entertained so much respect
for the opinions and example of Logan, that they
agreed to be governed by his decision. Of this
the British were well aware, and spared no
exertions
to win over to their cause a chieftain of
such acknowledged bravery and extensive
influence
.
But Logan possessed too much integrity to be
seduced into a cause which his soul condemned,
or to sell the services of his faithful followers to
support injustice and unwarrantable aggression.
Many a feudal lord in Christendom has, on a like
occasion, evinced less of the Christian spirit than
this heathen. He repeatedly solicited Harrison
to accept of his services; who, after
considerable
hesitation on the part of government, was
finally permitted to give him employment, and
he joined the American army, in September last,
when marching to relieve Fort Wayne, which,
you know, was then closely besieged. The army
approached that place on the evening of the
twelfth, when the invaders fled with precipitation.
Logan went forward with about seven hundred
of his men, raised an Indian yell, and pursued
the retreating tribes. The signal was answered
by them, at the distance of about one hundred
and fifty yards; but the intervention of the river,
and several other obstacles, prevented the
pursuit
being attended with effect.
Having thus raised the siege of Fort Wayne,
[10]
[10]
Fort Wayne is situated at the confluence of St.
Joseph's and
St. Maty's rivers, whose waters united form the river
called the
Miami of the Lakes, which empties into Erie. Two hundred
miles
below this fortress, stands Fort Defiance, (or, as it has
lately been
called, Fort Winchester) which is built on the point of
land formed by
the confluence of the
Aux
Glaize
with the Miami, about half way
between Fort Wayne and
Fort Meigs; the latter stands near the
rapids
of this river, and consequently not a great distance from
the
Lake.
Harrison and Winchester immediately made
preparations
for marching a sufficient number of
troops down the bank of the river, to relieve the
intermediate garrisons between that place and
Detroit. Through the exertions of our worthy
and patriotic governor,
[11]
[11]
His excellency R. J. Meigs, who was
afterwards appointed
PostMaster-General
of the United States.
every necessary supply
was forwarded with the greatest despatch to the
army, and Winchester advanced with about two
thousand men down the river towards Fort
Defiance
,
while Harrison fixed his head-quarters at
St. Mary's, about sixty miles apart. On
approaching
his place of destination, after a tedious
march of seven days, Winchester found the fort
in possession of the enemy, who were so strong
that he thought it imprudent to proceed; he
therefore sent to Harrison for reinforcements,
who immediately proceeded with general
Tupper's
mounted men, to the assistance of his friend.
The British and Indians, however, did not wait
to receive him; but, as soon as they heard of his
approach, evacuated the Fort, and took the
cannon
with them down the river towards the rapids.
A considerable period of inactivity
succeeded
this event. Harrison had departed to join the
right wing of the army, and to concentrate the
whole at an appointed rendezvous. Until this
concentration
could be effected, any further
movements
would not tend to promote the end in view.
But during this interval, Logan was sighing
for more active employment. Such deliberate
operations were not exactly congenial to his ideas
of carrying on the war; he wished to be in the
field with the enemy in front. While thus
goaded
by his own impatient ardor to act, a rumor had
reached his ears that the American officers had
expressed doubts of his boasted courage and
skill in war, as he had been so long with the
army
and done nothing. Logan either
fears
or
loves
the enemy. This was too much for
Logan
.
Stung to the soul, he immediately
demanded
employment, when Winchester permitted him
to take two of his followers, and proceed down
the river bank to examine the movements of the
enemy. In executing this service they had to
pass a narrow defile in the forest, from which an
ambuscade darted so suddenly upon them that
they were instantly made prisoners.
What must have been the feelings of Logan,
who, so far from having redeemed the reputation
which he imagined had been tarnished, was now
perhaps forever deprived of the power! The
party
which had captured them consisted of five
mounted warriors, under the command of the
celebrated
Wynemack
. Nothing but a stratagem
could rescue the prisoners, and Logan's ready
invention
quickly contrived one. He addressed
himself
to Wynemack, expressing much surprise at
such hostile treatment of men who had risked so
much in coming to join them. Since you see we
are friends, (he added) there is no time to be lost;
follows us, and an encampment of white men can
be surprised and destroyed. The credulous
victors believed him, and permitted their three
captives to lead them on to the anticipated
massacre
.
33
Logan having communicated to his
comrades
his determination to rescue himself, or
perish
in the effort, they wheeled suddenly on their
enemy, and each brought his man to the ground:
Wynemack being one of the fallen. The
remaining
three instantly returned the fire, (which
wounded Logan and one of his men) and then
made off. Logan exchanged the shot,
notwithstanding
his wound was mortal; and springing
with his wounded companion, upon the horses of
two of those whom they had just killed, whilst his
third man protected him in his retreat, he
returned
to the fort. This happened on the
twenty-second
of November; on the twenty-eighth he
expired
,
with the firmness of a brave warrior,
sincerely
regretted by the whole garrison.
Thus has our faithful, generous friend split
his life's blood in the cause of American freedom;
being the second of the name whom the history of
our country will notice for his attachment to her
cause. His brave and enterprising son, who is
now in the field, will be the third; be forever
grateful, George, that you was made the
instrument
of preserving a life which will always be
devoted
to the defence of our country.
Some time after the foregoing event, the left
wing of the army, under Winchester, marched
from Fort Defiance down to the rapids, in
conformity
to the order of Harrison, who had removed
his head-quarters to Upper Sandusky. In the
mean time, from the movements of the enemy, the
inhabitants of Frenchtown, on the river Raisin,
became so seriously alarmed, that they solicited
Winchester to march immediately to their
protection
,
although the troops at that time under his
command were far inferior in numbers to the
collected
force of the British and Indians by whom
the village was menaced. In compliance with
this earnest solicitation, but without the authority
or knowledge of the commander in chief,
Winchester
determined upon marching, with his small
force, (then reduced to eight hundred men, by
the discharge of those regiments whose term of
service had expired) to prevent, if possible, the
destruction of the village, and the massacre of
the inhabitants. Very wrong as a soldier, but
very right as a man.
Colonel Lewis marched first, with his
detachment
,
which was to be joined on the way by that
of lieutenant-colonel Allen, and followed by the
main body under Winchester himself. On
approaching
Frenchtown, Lewis was informed that
about five hundred of the enemy were already
encamped
in the village; and, without hesitation,
determined to attack them. The charge was
impetuous
and successful; he carried the picketing
of their right wing with ease, dislodged both
British
and Indians, and drove them into the woods.
Allen, with his detachment, made a simultaneous
attack on the left, with the same success. Twice
did the enemy rally, and renew the contest with
desperation, and thrice were they compelled to
retreat in disorder, and were finally entirely
dispersed
.
In this conflict much blood was spilt on
both sides.
Lewis encamped on the same ground which
had been occupied by the enemy, and was, in two
days after, joined by Winchester with the
remainder
of his troops, now amounting in all to
about seven hundred and fifty effective men. Six
hundred were posted in pickets, and the rest
encamped
in an open field.
On the morning of the twenty-second instant,
at revellee, Proctor and Tecumseh, at the head of
above two thousand men, attacked the
encampment
so suddenly that many of the Americans
were literally cut to pieces. They were soon
formed, however, and after repelling the
assailants
for some time with unparalleled coolness
and intrepidity, the combatants closed in a
promiscuous
fray. The contest was now long,
obstinate
,
and sanguinary; but more like a
massacre
than a regular battle. Winchester's quarters
were several hundred yards from the
encampment
,
to which he had scarcely arrived when he
was taken prisoner. Seeing his brave
countrymen
desperately contending with such superior
force, and covering the field with their slain,
Winchester
sent a flag to the field and advised a
surrender
,
which advice was complied with. The
loss of the Americans was
two hundred and
ninety-seven
men killed and missing
, twenty-two of whom
were officers. Only twenty-five were wounded,
which shows the desperate valor with which the
contest was maintainedevery wound was a
death, with this trifling exception. The loss of
the enemy was not less, but could not be
ascertained
,
as they resorted to their usual means of
preventing a discovery, by removing the
bodies
,
&c.
But the most horrid part of my story is yet
to be told. The express conditions of the
surrender
werethat the Americans should be
protected
from the fury of the savages; that private
property should be respected, and that the
sidearms
of the officers should be returned. Not one
of these conditions was complied with. No
sooner
had the Americans relinquished their arms,
than they were robbed of every thing, under
uplifted
tomahawks and scalping-knives, and
stripped
even of their personal apparel. Every
prisoner
whose wounds rendered him unable to
march to Malden, was murdered and scalped on
the spot, and all who gave out on the way,
shared
the same bloody fate. Many of the houses in
Frenchtown were wantonly burnt, and several
defenceless
inhabitants, who had not been in the
engagement
,
inhumanly butchered without
provocation
.
To be sure, all these atrocities were
committed by Indiansbut their white allies did
not raise a finger to prevent them. The blood
rests on British heads.
The barbarities of the enemy, (both white
and red) are shocking beyond conception; and,
as judge Woodward told Proctor, will one day
meet the steady and impartial eye of history.
Dr. M`Keehan, surgeon's mate to the second
regiment
of our Ohio militia, was sent to Malden
under
the protection of a flag, to attend to the sick and
wounded prisoners. But regardless of the
sanctity
of his flag, he was fired upon by the enemy,
near the rapids, his companion killed, himself
wounded, and he is now in close confinement as a
spy!
General Armstrong, I understand, has been
appointed secretary of war, in the room of
Eustis
,
who has resigned. Write often, and
believe
me to be, as ever, your affectionate father,
EDWARD WILLOUGHBY.Boston, Mas.
February
16, 1813.
I hasten, my dear brother, to furnish an
antidote
to the melancholy which the writing of your
last must have occasioned.
Another British frigate has been captured
and sunk by the staunch old Constitution; but
our friend and cousinthe amiable Aylwin,
sleeps with
the brave, who sink to rest,
With all their country's honors blest.
This will, of course, be a drawback on your
pleasure
;
but when you reflect (as I know you will)
that his short life was marked with every trait of
virtue and honor, that he fell in the service of his
country, covered with glory, and that to those
who have lived like Aylwin, death is only the
commencement of a more glorious lifeI say
when you reflect on these things, you may with
me regret the loss of his society, but will not be
so selfish as to wish to recall him. His virtues
belonged to his immortal part, and can never die.
His friendship we shall still enjoy, and to his
society
we shall one day be restored.
A friend, when dead, is but removed from sight,
Sunk in the lustre of eternal light;
And when the parting storms of life are o'er,
May yet rejoin us on a happier shore.
The Constitution arrived at this port
yesterday
,
and lieutenant Ludlow has proceeded to the
seat of government with Bainbridge's official
despatch
to the secretary of the navy, and the colors
of the vanquished enemy; which was his
Britannic
majesty's frigate Java, of forty-nine guns and
four hundred and fifty men. I conversed a few
minutes with Ludlow, who gave me the following
account:
The action took place on the twenty-ninth of
December, (the very day on which captain Hull,
the former Commander of the constitution, was a
guest at the dinner given by the corporation and
citizens of New-York, in honor of the exploits of
our naval heroes) in latitude thirteen, about ten
leagues from the coast of Brazil, and lasted one
hour and fifty-five minutes; in which time the
Java
was made a complete wreck, having her
bowsprit
and every mast and spar shot out of her.
The Constitution had nine killed and twenty-five
wounded. The Java had sixty killed and about
a hundred wounded. Among the latter was her
commander, Lambert, a very distinguished
officer
,
mortally. From a letter written by one of
her officers whilst on board the Constitution, it is
evident that the wounded must have been
considerably
greater, and many must have died of their
wounds previous to removal. The letter states
sixty killed and a hundred and seventy wounded.
Aylwin commanded the forecastle division,
and Ludlow assured me that his bravery and
marked coolness throughout the contest, gained
him the admiration of his commander, and all who
had an opportunity of witnessing him. When
boarders were called to repel boarders, he
mounted
the quarter-deck hammock cloths, and, in the
act of firing his pistols at the enemy, he received
a ball through the same shoulder in which he was
wounded before. Notwithstanding the serious
nature of his wound, he continued at his post
until
the enemy had struck; and even then did not
make known to the surgeon his own situation, nor
until all the wounded had been dressed. His zeal
and courage did not forsake him in his last
moments
:
for a few days after the action, although
laboring under considerable debility, and the
most excruciating pain, he left his state-room, and
repaired to quarters, when an engagement was
expected with a ship, which afterwards proved
to be the Hornet. He bore his pain with great
and unusual fortitude, and expired, without a
groan, on the twenty-eighth of January.
A dauntless soul erect, who smiled on death.
The Java was rated at thirty-eight guns, but
mounted forty-nine. She was just out of dock,
and fitted in the most complete manner to carry
out lieutenant-general Hislop, governor of
Bombay
,
and his staff; captain Marshal, a
commander
in the British navy, and a number of naval
officers going to join the British ships of war in
the East Indies. Besides these, and having her
own complement of officers and men complete,
she had upwards of one hundred supernumeraries
of petty officers and seamen for the admiral's ship
and other vessels on the East India station. She
also had despatches from the British government
for St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and
every
British establishment in the East Indies and
China seas, and had copper on board for a
seventy-four
gun ship and two sloops of war, building
at Bombay, and it is presumed many other
valuables
,
all of which were blown up in her on the
thirty-first of December, when she was set on fire.
The Constitution was considerably cut in her
spars, rigging, and sails; but not so much injured
but that she could have commenced another
action
immediately after the capture of the Java,
which latter vessel was made a perfectly
unmanageable
wreck.
A seaman on board the Constitution, named
John Cheeves, was mortally wounded, and whilst
lying on the deck apparently dying, the word was
passed that the enemy had struck. He raised
himself up with one hand, gave three cheers, fell
back, and expired! Heroic specimen of the
genuine patriotism of American tars! His brother
was also wounded, and has since died. They
have left an aged and helpless mother at
Marblehead
,
who depended entirely on the fruits of their
industry for a subsistence.
The news of this third achievement of our
favorite Constitution was announced from the
stage by Mr. Powell, the manager, last evening,
and was received with repeated acclamations.
Rodgers and Hull, with their ladies, and several
other officers of the navy, were present, and
received
congratulations on the event.
Gentlemen who have been on board the
Constitution
,
which still lies in the lower harbor,
mention
having learnt that Bainbridge received two
wounds in the action, one by a musket ball, the
other by langrage; that the Java was well fought
and bravely defended; and though the
Constitution
could have been prepared for another battle
immediately, she was very considerably injured
in her spars, sails, bulwarks, &c.
The Constitution has on board part of the
cargo of the schooner Helen, from London for St.
Salvador, captured by the Hornet, captain
Lawrence
,
off the latter port; the schooner was given
up.
The Java touched at St. Jago, Cape de
Verds, and learned that the Essex, captain Porter,
had been thereand supposing the Constitution
to be that frigate, with carronades only, kept at
long shot, which prolonged the action. They
learned by the officers of the Java that the Essex
had captured a sloop of war, and four rich prizes.
The Hornet was left off St. Salvador,
watching
the British sloop of war Bonne Citoyenne,
said to have on board one million seven hundred
thousand dollars. Captain Lawrence had
challenged
the British captain to come out and try the
fortune of war with him, but the wary
Englishman
declined the combat. They begin to
respect
Yankee cock-boats.
All the officers and seamen taken in the Java,
were paroled by commodore Bainbridge, and
landed on the third of January at St. Salvador,
Brazils.
Honors are now lavished on Decatur and
Jones similar to those which Hull has received.
Bainbridge's turn comes nextand who next?
Perhaps Rodgers; he strives hard to find the
enemy, and would no doubt give a good account
of them should he meet them. He arrived at this
port on New-Year's day, at the same hour the
Macedonian entered the harbor of New-York,
through the Sound. Admiral Warren has arrived
off that port, with a considerable squadron, and
has expressed his determination to lay the whole
coast, south of New-York, under a most strict and
rigorous blockade. Our privateers are doing
wonders.
Your friends here are all enjoying good
health, and Amelia desires to be particularly
remembered
to her dear brother. You have
been an
uncle
above six weeks, and Amelia
insists
upon calling the infant Catharine. You
know how to appreciate this compliment. Adieu.
EDGAR MORSE.Boston
,
March
21, 1813.
Another Naval Victory
, my dear George,
has rewarded the courage and enterprise of
American
sailors, and the name of
Lawrence
is now
inscribed with those of Hull, Decatur, Jones, and
Bainbridge, on an imperishable pillar of glory.
On the twenty-fourth day of February last,
while cruising off Demarara, the American sloop
of war Hornet, commanded by captain Lawrence,
fell in with the British brig Peacock, captain
Peake, and captured her, after a sanguinary
action
of
fourteen minutes
. The contest
commenced
within half pistol shot, and so tremendous was
the fire of the Americans, that when she
surrendered
she was an absolute wreck, in a sinking
condition, displaying a signal of distress.
Notwithstanding
every exertion was made to keep
34
her afloat until the prisoners could be removed,
she sunk with thirteen of her crew, and three
brave American tars, who thus nobly perished in
relieving a conquered foe.
The slaughter on board of the Peacock was
very severe; among the slain was found the body
of her commander, captain Peake. He was twice
wounded in the course of the action; the last
wound proved fatal. His body was wrapped in
the flag of his ship, and laid in the cabin to sink
with her; a shroud and sepulchre worthy so brave
a sailor.
It is a fact worthy of note, and in the highest
degree honorable to our brave tars, that on the
day succeeding the destruction of the Peacock,
the crew of the Hornet made a subscription and
supplied the prisoners (who had lost almost every
thing) with two shirts and a jacket and trowsers
each.
It is singular, that in this action, when the first
broadsides were exchanged at half pistol shot,
the pendant on the mainmast of the Hornet was
shot away, one man was killed in the top, and the
upper rigging much injured, but no mark of a
ball was seen below the main-top. The Hornet's
fire had quite a different effect on the Peacock;
it was so well directed, that several of the shot
pierced the hull of the Peacock through and
through, killed a number of men, and, in a
measure
,
decided the contest.
This victory (says a morning paper) will
excite
afresh the wonder of the world! The sinking
the British sloop of war Peacock, by the United
States sloop of war Hornet, in
fifteen
minutes, will
fill England with amazement and dismay. The
Peacock was as large a vessel as the Hornet, and
carried more guns. To cut this ship to pieces,
to kill and wound between thirty and forty of
her men, while the American ship lost but
one
killed and two wounded
, is a circumstance so
extraordinary
,
that it impresses the minds of our
countrymen with an exultation mixed with
solemnity
!
Is it merely our prowessor is it the
finger of Heaven pointing to the path of our
future
glory? These successes fill not the mind with
a noisy and giddy joy, but with a solemn and
grateful sentiment towards that Power which
controls
the world, and giveth us the victory, by
teaching our hands to war, and our fingers to
fight!
But enough, for the present, of `blood
stained
glory.' Accompany me, for a few minutes, in
the humbler walks of civil and domestic life, and
let the subject of our contemplation be
Woman
,
`Heaven's last, best gift to man.' Harriet
Palmer
,
whose gentle manners, amiable disposition,
and unassuming excellence, had secured her the
love of all her acquaintancehas gone to taste the
fruits of virtue in `another and a better world.'
Amelia and myself have just returned from
paying
the last sad duties to her mortal part, which
has just been committed to its kindred earth.
Her affectionate parents are in the deepest
affliction
,
having previously received some
distressing
intelligence respecting Sophia, who married
the old German, in New-York, where she has
since resided. I am ignorant of the particulars,
but believe that the connexion is not productive
of the promised felicity. It was a
money match
,
and they are seldom happy. This circumstance,
it is believed, hastened the death of Harriet
Yet other secret griefs had she,
O pillow! only told to thee:
Say, did not hopeless love intrude
On her poor bosom's solitude?
Be this as it may, her little earthly drama is
concluded, and the curtain dropped. Her
character
was amiable, chaste, and correctand for
filial affection and domestic virtues, she has not
left her equalnor will the slightest blemish ever
be discovered on the spotless purity of her fame.
Whatever may have been her secret sorrows, she
is now (I have no doubt) a happy angel in that
permanent world of which this is but an
imperfect
shadow, like the broken image of a beautiful
landscape reflected from the trembling surface of
a troubled lake.
All, all on earth is shadowall beyond
Is substance; the reverse is folly's creed.
How solid all where change shall be no more!
Who can be ashamed to pay homage to a
virtuous woman? It should be our ambitionour
pride. She is the purest abstract of Deity that
can be found in all his works. She is the image
of love, of purity, and truthand she lives and
moves in the person of Amelia.
Woman
ever has been, still is, and always
will be, the main spring, the
primum mobile
of
every masculine achievement, from the hero to
the clownfrom the man to the stripling; and
whether she fire a Troy, or excite emulation in a
game at marbles; whether she influence a court
or rule in a dairy, the end, cause, and effect, are
still the same. We may talk of Patriotismwe
may prate of Fame; but who could feel the one,
or seek the other, but for the sake of woman?
In every character WOMAN is interesting,
though not always amiablewe may not love, but
we must admire. Whether as the venerable
matron
,
or the blooming maid; the chaste wife, or the
affectionate mistress; the tender sister, or the
blushing bride; old or young, married or
unmarried
,
virtuous or viciousstill she will
command
our admiration, and influence our actions.
You will not condemn me for enthusiasm, for
you
are no stoic. I know that there are some
hearts, cut by capricious Fate from the icy
coagulations
of the poles, or moulded from the frozen
snow-drifts of Siberia, that are not susceptible of
softening in the brightest rays that emanate from
celestial beauty. There
are
such heartsbut
let their possessors forbear to boast of them; they
are the mere abortions of Naturethe eternal
foes of genius; mere thistles and night-shade in
the garden of creation.
For them no fancy consecrates the scene.
You know the rest of this beautiful passage in
Campbell's `Pleasures of Hope,' ending thus:
And say, without our hopes, without our fears,
Without the home that plighted love endears;
Without the smile from partial beauty won;
O what were man? A world without a sun.
Blest with their smiles, this world becomes a
heavenwithout them, heaven itself would lose
half its charms. O that you could have
witnessed
Amelia at the death-bed of Harriet Palmer!
Never before did she appear so lovelyh in my
eyes. Day after day, and night after night, has
she watched by the pillow of her friend,
administering
34*
her medicine, sustaining her head on her
bosom, and wiping the clammy dews of death
from her sunken cheeks. O George, it is in such
a scene that lovely woman shines, and until I saw
your sister thus employed, I did not half
appreciate
the treasure I possess in that angel of
humanity
.
Heaven grant me grace to be duly
thankful for the gift.
Playful and artless, on the summer wave,
Sporting with buoyant wing, the fairy scene
With fairest grace adorning; but in wo,
In poverty, in soul-subduing toils,
In patient tending on the sick man's bed,
In ministerings of love, in bitterest pangs,
Faithful and firm;in scenes where sterner hearts
Have crack'd, still cheerful and still kind.
Our hero had scarcely finished reading this
letter
,
when a lad entered his apartment, and
advancing
timidly forward, with a very modest
deportment, inquired
Is lieutenant Willoughby in want of an
attendant
,
during the approaching campaign?
George (who was now folding a letter which
he had written previous to receiving Morse's)
was on the point of answering in the negative;
but on contemplating the applicant a moment, he
was struck with something peculiarly interesting
in his melancholy countenance and diffident
manners
,
which induced him to prolong the interview.
He therefore asked him
Who wants a situation in that capacity?
Myself, sir; replied the lad; and if I am
permitted to serve
you
, the gratitude I shall feel
will always be a spur to my duty.
Have you ever served as an officer's waiter?
No, sir; but I feel fully competent to
discharge
the duties of one, and shall study
diligently
to become acquainted with them.
I am much deceived, replied George, or
you possess education and talents superior to the
situation you are seeking. What then can be
your object?
I feel an enthusiastic predilection for a
military
life, sir, but am too young for a soldier. To
be the personal attendant of a brave officer,
during
one campaign, will at once gratify my taste,
and gradually initiate me into a profession I am
determined to adopt. Will you employ me?
How old are you?
A little more than fourteen.
What is your name?Who are your
parents
?
My name is Reuben, and I am an orphan.
My education has been good, and my prospects
in life were brilliant; I looked forward to nothing
but happiness. A mercenary relation, however,
under whose protection I was placed, actuated by
motives of avarice only, bound me an apprentice
to a trade I hated and a master I despised. With
him, servitude was slavery, and I yet bear the
marks of his cruelty on my person. I at length
became wearied of existence, and determined to
leave him; and he, suspecting my intention,
watched me so very narrowly, that it was some
time before I could elude his vigilance, and make
my escape, which I at length effected in the night,
and immediately set out for the army, determined
to seek you, and solicit your protection.
Why
me?
asked George; Do you know
me?
Only by reputation, sir, answered Reuben;
though I have frequently seen you in Boston.
Our hero thought the countenance and voice
were both familiar to him; but he could not
recollect
the person of the lad. It was very
probable
,
however, that he had seen him in Boston.
He surveyed him a moment in silence, and then
asked
What are your terms?
Just such as you please to propose.
I will employ you. When do you wish to
commence?
Immediately, replied Reuben with alacrity,
while his countenance brightened with a smile of
pleasure.
To-day? asked our hero.
This moment, if you please.
Content. Take this note to the quarters of
lieutenant Cooke, and leave it without waiting for
an answer.
Reuben was overjoyed at his success, and
expressed
his gratitude and affection by kissing the
hand from which he received the letter; then,
making a graceful bow, he flew to execute his
commission.My dear Clara
,
We are now standing on and off the harbor
of York, which we shall attack at day-light in
the morning. I shall dedicate these last moments
to you, my love, and to-morrow throw all other
ideas but my country to the winds. As yet I
know not if general Dearborn lands; he has
acted
honorably so far, and I feel great gratitude to
the old gentleman: my sword and pen shall both
be exerted to do him honor. I have no new
injunction
no
new charge to give you; nor any
new idea to communicate; yet we love to
commune
with those we love, more especially when
we conceive it may be the last time in this world.
Should I fall, defend my memory: and only
believe
,
had I lived, I would have aspired to deeds
worthy of your husband. Remember me with a
father's lovea father's care, to our dear
daughter
,
and believe me to be, with the warmest
sentiments
of love and friendship, your
MONTGOMERY.Friday Evening, July
16, 1813.
To Captain Thomas Sandford
.
Sir
Pity alone has prompted me to take
this method of relieving an embarrassment which
must not only be very painful to your feelings,
but which (judging from what I this day
witnessed
)
will so impede the performance of your
professional
duties, as to endanger your reputation.
But, sir, you may discard all
apprehensions
from
your mindI shall
never
molest you. You know
the word of George Washington Willoughby is
sacredit was never yet violated
I shall not
condescend to chastise a being whose meanness has
sunk him so far below my resentment
. I know
what you might reasonably expect from many of
our young officers, were they placed in my
situation
.
But it is well known to you that my notions
of honor are altogether different. You have
never
injured me, because
it was not in your power
.
But even if your despicable attempts had
succeeded
had
you robbed me of my greatest
earthly treasure, your blood would no more tend
to wash away the injury, than that which daily
flows in the meanest butcher's shambles.
Entertain
no fears, then, for your life; I shall
never
seek to deprive you of a gem so tarnished with
corruption, and yet, so dear to its possessor.
But, sir, though I harbor no resentment
against you, and shall meet you on duty with
perfect
indifference, yet, do not seek my society; for
our dispositions are so diametrically opposite,
that no happiness can result from intercourse.
No intimacy, therefore, must ever exist between
us, until I have evident and incontrovertible
proofs of a thorough reformation in your morals,
and a radical change in your life and disposition.
Then (but not till then) will I take you cordially
by the hand, and ask no apology for the past.
G. W. WILLOUGHBY.Cleveland, Ohio
,
July 20th
, 1813.
Call all your native fortitude to your aid, my
son, for the intelligence I have to communicate
is afflicting. Catharine Fleming is safe under
my protectionwould I could say she was well.
Her amiable mother has joined the rest of her
unfortunate family in a better world. Fleming
is a prisoner of war, and their house is in ashes.
Mulberry Grove exhibits nothing but a black
heap of smoking ruins. First recover that
and then thou shalt hear further.
Before George reached the last sentence, the
characters swam before his eyeshis limbs
tottered
,
and he was obliged to cling to the door for
support. Logan helped him to a seat, and after
a powerful struggle with his feelings, he
regained
sufficient composure to proceed.
In my last I informed you that the
depredations
of the savages were extended along the
shores of this lake, and that many of the
inhabitants
had been killed or made prisoners. But a
severe check which they afterwards received
from the gallant colonel Ball, had lulled our fears
to rest, in this vicinity.
On Sunday morning, the eighteenth instant,
young Logan arrived at the Grove, and informed
me that he had been solicited to join a party of
Seneca and Tuscorora Indians, whom Boyd had
consented to receive into the American service,
and that he was then on his way to Fort George
for that purpose. On learning that you was at
that encampment, he consented to stop until I
could prepare a letter and a small remittance for
you, which I knew could be safely confided to so
trusty a messenger. When night came, Logan,
as usual, spread his blanket in the porch, and
slept with his rifle in his hand.
About midnight I was awakened by the
report
of fire-arms, and springing from my bed,
found my chamber illumined by a bright light
that shone through my window, and before I
could slip on my clothes, Logan flew into the
room and informed me that a party of Indians had
fired the stable, and were now approaching the
house. The alarm had now spread through the
house, and the shrieks of the housekeeper and
her two daughters, added not a little to the general
consternation.
While my laborers were hurrying on their
clothes and seizing their rifles, which we always
kept loaded, I took a position to reconnoitre the
enemy, and by the light of the conflagrated
outhouses
,
(which by this time were all participating
in the fate of the stable) I ascertained their force
to be not more than twenty, and that a retreat was
open for the women through the garden. They
wanted no urging to fly, and I directed them to
conceal themselves in the woods until the danger
was over. They had scarcely left the house,
when a volley of rifle slugs was poured against it,
which did no other damage, however, than
shatter
the windows, and perforate the wall.
Our force was but twelve men, including
myself. Five of them followed Logan through
the garden to attack their rear, while the rest of
us made a sortie on their front. We met them on
the platform, as they were loading their pieces,
and came upon them so suddenly that it threw
them into disorder, they having no idea that my
house was a garrison. Every rifle dropped its
man, in front and rear. The survivors returned
our fire, and then retreated with their customary
yell. We followed up the advantage we had
gained, and a second discharge so diminished
their numbers, that we imagined the contest was
terminated; when, turning my eyes towards
Fleming's, I saw his habitation in flames, and a
band of about thirty savages rapidly
approaching
the Grove.
Three of our little band were badly wounded,
but no one was dismayed. I hastily posted them
behind the stone wall which separates the little
orchard from the road, with orders to reserve
their fire until the advancing savages (with whom
the fugitives had now formed a junction) were
passing the muzzles of our pieces. One of our
40
party, however, imprudently, fired too soon, and
totally defeated the object of my arrangement.
The savages paused a moment, and then assailed
our little breast-work with such fury that it was
soon carried, while our fire was wasted at
random
.
Our party was surrounded, and nearly
cut to pieces; Logan fought like a blood-hound,
beating down the foe with the but end of his rifle,
until the stock was shivered in his hands; he
then seized a hatchet from a fallen chief, and
literally cut a path through the enemy, by which
three of us effected our retreat; the remainder
were either slain, or made prisoners. Logan,
myself, and a young Irishman whom I had lately
employed, were all that escaped the contest, and
we precipitately fled across the meadow towards
Cleveland, leaving the enemy masters of the field.
When we reached the road, we ventured to pause,
and looking back, saw the flames just bursting
through the roof of our habitation. A horrid yell
of the savages announced their hellish joy at the
sight, and we could now see them preparing to
decamp, several of the painted devils being
mounted on my horses.
The sound of an approaching bugle now
saluted
our ears, and in a few minutes a small corps
of mounted riflemen met us on the road from
Cleveland. The alarm had extended to that
village
,
and these brave fellows had immediately
assembled to pursue the barbarous enemy. I
gave their leader every necessary direction, and
the little company again set forward on a gallop.
The day was now dawning, and I determined
to seek some intelligence respecting the family of
Fleming. With the most fearful presentiments I
approached that once happy seat of virtue and
hospitality. The ruins of the dwelling-house
were still blazing, but the barn had not been
fired. As we approached that building, Logan
directed my attention to a track of blood on the
ground, and my own curdled with horror. I
rushed
forward determined to know the worst.
The barn door was open, and we entered,
when a sight met our view, calculated to melt the
stoutest heart with pity, and nerve the weakest
with courage. On the cold bare floor sat
Catharine
,
supporting on her knees the head of her
mother
,
and endeavoring to stanch with her linen
the blood that issued from a wound in that
mother's
breast. Unfortunately Logan first met the
eye of Catharine, who uttered a piercing shriek,
and sunk lifeless on the bleeding bosom of her
mother. Mrs. Fleming raised her languid eyes
to me, and attempted to speak. Fly for
assistance
!
I exclaimed to Logan, who disappeared
at the word. Assisted by Patrick, I succeeded in
removing the females to a crib of straw, spread
over them our outside garments, (for both of them
were in their night-frocks) and screened them
from the morning air as well as circumstances
would permit. Catharine soon recovered from
her swoon, but wept so excessively that I trembled
for her heart. I now examined the wound in her
mother's bosom, and shuddered on discovering
that it was made with a rifle ball! She observed
my consternation, and faintly uttered, as she
pressed my hand
I know itI know it. I am sensible that my
hour is almost come, and I am resigned to my
fate. But, O, protect and comfort poor
Catharine
me
you cannot help. O, my poor husband!
what may be his fate! Should Catharine be
indeed
an orphan, you will not desert her?
A short captivity, I replied, is, I trust, the
worst fate that my friend is doomed to suffer from
the enemy. In any event, however, I solemnly
promise to be a friend and father to Catharine.
Logan now entered, with several persons of
both sexes, whom he had met flying towards the
scene of devastation, to furnish every assistance
in their power. A litter was procured for Mrs.
Fleming, on which she was gently placed, and
borne by four men to Cleveland. Fleming's
family
waggon followed, with the almost distracted
Catharine, supported between two of her female
friends, assisted by myself. On our arrival, a
surgeon was procured, who immediately
pronounced
the wound of Mrs. Fleming to be mortal;
and, in an hour afterwards, she expired.
The mounted riflemen who pursued the
Indians
,
succeeded in driving them into the woods,
killed two, and made one prisoner. I directed
Logan to examine this Indian, and from his report
I am convinced that Fleming has fallen into their
hands alive and unhurt. Four of my little band
were left lifeless in the orchard along with seven
of the savages, who were all buried last evening
in the spot where they fell. Most of the prisoners
are severely wounded. Those who fell on the
platform, are buried in the smoking ruins of the
house.
Of the horrid transactions at Fleming's, I can
give you no account, until Catharine becomes
sufficiently
composed to relate what passed under
her observation. The body of Susan (who was
married, soon after you left us, last summer, to a
very worthy laborer on Fleming's plantation) was
found at some distance from the barn, mangled in
a manner too horrid for descriptionan unborn
infant, which had been torn from her womb, lay
near her feet, cloven nearly in two by a
tomahawk
!
The unhappy husband is probably a
prisoner
with Fleming. The females of my family,
who remained concealed in the woods until after
sunrise, have arrived in safety at Cleveland.
The bodies of Mrs. Fleming and Susan, will
be buried to-morrow, and will be followed by a
larger procession of real mourners, than this place
has ever exhibited on any former occasion.
Catharine is, at present, inconsolable; but
God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb. I
have communicated the melancholy event to her
uncle, William O'Hara, who has joined Perry's
squadron at Erie, and holds some respectable
office on board the commodore's brig.
To-morrow
I shall write to my friend Harrison,
requesting
him to exert his influence to procure the
release
of the prisoners on parole; or, at least, that
of Fleming, whose presence would tend, more
than any thing else, to restore the tranquility of
Catharine's mind.
Logan will make no delay in flying to his
preserver with this letter. If he can serve you
in any thing, make him happy by employing him.
A remittance, you must not expect; but if you
are absolutely in want, draw on your uncle in
Boston, and the draught will be duly honored.
My loss is severe, as not a single article was
saved at Mulberry Grove; but this is a loss which
can soon be repaired. My crops bid fair to be
excellent, and as I have now no barns, I shall sell
them on the field.
40*
I shall write again soon, when you may
expect
further particulars. In the mean time,
forget
not to place a due reliance on Providence,
who orders all things for the best; and still believe
me to be, as ever, your affectionate father,
E. WILLOUGHBY.Cleveland, Ohio
,
July 25
, 1813.
I am happy, my dear boy, to inform you, that
by a courier, who is travelling express from
Harrison's
head-quarters to Erie, I have received a
letter from Fleming, written on board an English
gun-boat in Sandusky Bay, just preparing to sail
for Malden. He is anxious to learn the fate of his
family, and fears the worst. Catharine herself
has undertaken to relieve this suspense, by
writing
immediately, and as flags are frequently
passing
between the two armies, there will be no
difficulty
attending its conveyance, except the
customary
inspection of its contents, which is of no
consequence. I am sensible of Harrison's
disposition
to oblige me, and he has promised to
exert
his influence in procuring Fleming's release.
May the choicest blessings of Heaven rest upon
the hero's head.
The certainty of yet possessing a father,
although
in captivity, has produced a happy effect
on the mind of Catharine, whose grief has now
subsided into a pensive calm. Her meek and
humble reliance on the love and wisdom of her
Heavenly Parent, has diffused a gentle quiet
through her soul, which has already exhibited its
beneficial influence on her bodily health. Such,
my son, are the delightful effects of a genuine
christian faith. As you value happiness, both
here and hereafter, never lose sight of this beacon
to the soul; and always bear in mind, that
no
faith can be genuine, which is not connected with a
good moral life
.
One of Harrison's reconnoitring or scouting
parties fell in with the savages, (after our
mounted
men had driven them into the woods) killed
four of their number, and retook two prisoners;
the remainder escaped to the lake shore, where a
large body of the enemy was assembled.
One of the re-captured prisoners is M`
Dougal
,
husband of the murdered Susan. From his
statement, combined with that of Catharine, and
both taken in connexion with Fleming's letter, the
following must be a tolerable correct account of
the transactions at Fleming's, on that disastrous
night:
The savages had fired the house, before any
alarm was given; and the whole family
narrowly
escaped perishing in their beds. Each one
flew, as fear impelled. Mrs. Fleming had
fainted
with terror, and her husband was bearing her
in his arms towards the barn, when a shot passed
under his left armpit, and entered her bosom; of
this, however, he was ignorant, until he felt
himself
covered with blood. Scarcely had he entered
the barn, when he was seized by the savages, who
tore the bleeding sufferer from his arms, and
dashed her on the cheerless floor. Raving like a
fury, Fleming scuffled until he was completely
overpowered; he was then forced away, and saw
neither wife nor daughter more.
Catharine had fled some distance, but
perceiving
that none of her friends followed, she
paused, and then as swiftly retraced her steps.
The savages were retreating, the house wrapped
in flames, and not a friend to be seen! O, George!
what must have been the mental anguish of that
poor girl! Shivering in the night air, from which
she was protected only by her linen tunic;
appalled
by the yell of triumph which was
reiterated
ed by the painted monsters, as they departed in
the full blaze of her burning mansion, and in
total
ignorance as to the fate of her parents!
While she stood aghast and horror-struck,
gazing on the maddening spectacle before her, a
deep groan issuing from within the barn (against
which she was now leaning) attracted her
attention
.
She immediately entered the
building
,
and by the light of the flames, which
shone through the expanded door, she
recognised
her dying mother, weltering in her own blood!
Why did not the distressed girl's heart-strings
crack at such a sight? Because God always
gives strength equal to the task imposed.
She raised her mother's head on her knees,
and endeavored to stanch the wound at which
her life's blood was issuing---it was all she could
do. Speak to me, my dear mother, O, speak
to your poor Catharine! she several times
exclaimed
.
Her mother opened her eyes, pressed
her daughter's hand, and then faintly asked for
her husband; but of his fate Catharine was also
ignorant. Fly, and leave me, Catharine; the
flames will reach the barn. Then we will both
die together, my mother, was the sweet angel's
reply---there are no assassins in Heaven. The
Indians are gone, and I fear not the fire. Such
was their situation, when we found them.
M`Dougal and his wife were seized as they
issued from the house; she was struck on the
head with a hatchet, but her husband was
fortunately
forced away too quickly to witness the
subsequent barbarities inflicted on the wife of his
bosom.
Fleming has a sister, who emigrated to this
country with her family, some years before him
self, and who is now a widow, residing in the
village of Ithaca, in the state of New-York.
Although
she married in Belfast, her husband was
an American, and owned several valuable estates
on the shores of Cayuga Lake. His name was
Woodcock; he has been dead about two years,
and has left one son to inherit the bulk of his
fortune
.
Mrs. Woodcock has repeatedly requested
her brother to permit Catharine to spend a
summer
with her at Ithaca, urging that as there was
but one daughter in the family, her time ought to
be divided between the brother and sister. Mrs.
Fleming, however, could not endure the thought
of a separation from her daughter, and so the
request
of the aunt has never been complied with.
But at Catharine's request, I have now written to
Mrs. Woodcock on the subject, and given a
history
of our recent misfortunes; I have requested
her answer to be directed to me at Erie, to which
place I shall take her niece in a few days, as I
think a change of scene and air will contribute to
her restoration. As soon as I have settled my
business here, and procured a suitable lad to drive
my carriage, I shall depart; so, if you intend to
write soon, direct to that place, also, as I shall
spend several days there with our cousin
Latamore
.

is secured, either by victory or peace. Adieu.
E. WILLOUGHBY.United States brig Lawrence,
Off Sandusky Bay
,
Aug.
18, 1813.
Dear Sir
,
We arrived at this place on the evening of
the thirteenth instant. By a pilot-boat, which was
sent out for observation, a British sail was
discovered
at anchor near one of the islands, and
the signal for chase was immediately made. By
dark, we were almost within gunshot of the
enemy
;
one hour more of day light, and she would
have been captured. A very severe storm came
on, and for fear of getting the squadron separated,
we anchored for the night. Captain Richardson
has gone on shore to proceed to Harrison's
head-quarters
at Seneca, and accompany the general
down to the fleet. General Clay, the
commandant
at Fort Meigs, has received orders from
Harrison
to reduce the compass of that fort in such a
manner as to enable three hundred men to hold
it, and then march with the balance of his force to
42
head-quarters, at Seneca. Preparations are
accordingly
making to convey the stores,
ammunition
,
and cannon, to Cleveland and Seneca, which
it will take about ten days to accomplish. After
these arrangements are completed, a force of five
thousand troops, regulars and militia, will embark
on board this squadron, and be conveyed to
Malden
,
where Harrison will retrieve all that Hull
lost. Previous to the embarkation, however, you
may expect to hear that we are masters of the
lake.
On the second instant, an affair took place
at the head of this bay, which will immortalize a
youthful hero, who is scarcely out of his teens.
Captain Croghan, who you know has several
times signalized himself in the Northwestern
army
,
(particularly in the successful sortie from
Fort Meigs, in May last) has recently been
promoted
to the rank of major, and appointed to the
command of Fort Stephenson, formerly called
Fort Sandusky, situated on Sandusky river, about
twenty miles from our present anchorage. The
situation of this post was considered by Harrison
to be so defenceless and exposed, that he
directed
Croghan to evacuate it immediately on the
approach of any considerable force of the enemy,
after destroying the public property.
This gallant youth, however, ventured to
disobey his commander, and saw his little
garrison
(of one hundred and sixty men) surrounded
by an immense army of British and Indians, who
had proceeded up the bay in gunboats, under the
command of Proctor and Tecumseh. There was
now no possibility of retreat, even if he had been
so disposed, and Croghan determined to defend
the fort to the last, in which determination he was
supported by every officer and man.
The fort was encircled by a deep ditch, nine
feet in width, which the enemy had to enter
before
he could approach the pickets, through the
heads of which bayonets were driven in a
horizontal
direction.
After directing a tremendous cannonade, for
several hours, against one angle of the fort,
without
producing a breach, the enemy determined to
storm; and a close column of three hundred and
fifty regulars was led on by a colonel Short,
assisted
by lieutenant Gordon, to make an attack on
the bombarded angle.
O for that pen with which Miss Porter
described
the desperate contest on Dumbarton
walls, that I might give you a just idea of this
tremendous assaultthis unparalleled defence.
But as I am not in possession of
her
pen, I will do
the best I can with my own.
The gallant Short advanced in the very face
of death, while his followers were, more than
once, thrown into confusion by the American fire.
But again they rallied, and with accelerated
motion
,
again pushed forward to the attack. In
vain a `leaden hailstorm' beat upon the
advancing
phalanx; in vain the horrid engines of
destruction
vomited death from their iron throats:
like a mighty torrent, the assailants still rushed
onwards, scattering the dead and wounded in
their crimsoned path.
For a moment they paused on the steep brink
of the deep-yawning trench that encircled the
fortress. Leap the ditch! exclaimed the
intrepid
leader of this undaunted column; cut
down the pickets! give no quarter! advance!
Instant, on the word, they poured down the bank
like a mountain cataract, whose sounds are
whispers
to the clashing of their jostling arms. The
ditch was filled, and a bristling row of iron pikes,
fixed in the heads of the pickets, impaled several
of the impetuous assailants. Again the voice of
their leader urges them forward: Scale the
pickets, and show no quarter! Storm!
This order was distinctly heard by the little
Spartan band which those pickets protected.
At this moment, what had appeared to the
assailants
a blank bastion, flanking the ditch,
suddenly
exhibited the blazing throat of ordnance,
from which so tremendous a shower of leaden
slugs and musket balls descended upon the
storming
column, that scarcely a man escaped without
a wound. The ditch ran with blood, and was
piled with mangled heaps of the slain and the
wounded.
Quarter! Quarter! exclaimed the colonel,
who had, a moment before, exhorted his men to
give none; but he called too late. Another
shower
of death swept through his disordered ranks,
and he fellwaving in his hand a symbol of the
mercy he claimed; and by his side fell the
gallant
Gordon. In vain did the surviving officers
without the ditch exert themselves to bring on a
reinforcement; both columns fled in disorder
before
the destructive tempest that pursued them,
and with their redoubtable leaders, Proctor and
Tecumseh, sought for safety in the adjacent
woods.
The din of battle now gradually subsided,
until
no sound was heard by the besieged but the
distant yell of the savage, and the shricks and
groans of the miserable wretches in the ditch;
the latter were sounds which could not fail to melt
with pity the brave hearts of American soldiers.
They were well aware of the fate which the
enemy
had prepared for them, and to which they
must have submitted, had the fortress been
carried
;
but the dreadful situation of the
vanquished
softened the resentment of the victors.
Americans
can
be subdued by the
sufferings
not by
the
prowess
of their enemies. Frequent attempts
were made to afford them assistance from the
walls of the fort; but the humane intention was
as often defeated by their own red allies, who had
been left by their commander, scattered at a
distance
round the fort, to revenge the loss of their
comrades, by chance-shots from the deadly rifle.
Night had now thrown her sable mantle round
the scene of blood, when the groans of anguish,
and cries for water, from dying wretches without
the pickets, grew so loud and distressing, that all
fears of danger or treachery were banished from
the humane bosoms of Croghan and his gallant
associates. The extreme darkness of the night,
and the uncertain position of the enemy,
rendered
it impossible to afford the unhappy sufferers
such succor as their situation required. All that
could be done for their relief, was to furnish them
water to allay the parching fever of death; and
this was let down to them in buckets and bottles.
Thus this little handful of heroes, after being on
severe duty for thirty successive hours, without
refreshment, willingly hazarded their lives to
alleviate
the sufferings of those who had sought, not
only their defeat, but their entire destruction.
On the following day, the enemy decamped
by the way they came, leaving one hundred and
fifty of their number to be interred or cured by
42*
the Americans; besides seventy stand of arms,
several brace of pistols, and a boat, containing
much clothing and military stores. Harrison has
expressed the warmest approbation of Croghan's
conduct, and recommended him to government
for still higher promotion.
The moment you receive any intelligence of
Fleming, fail not to communicate it to me, and to
all others interested in his fate. I wish to hear
that my drooping niece is restored to health and
happinessthe latter, however, cannot be soon
expected.
If we meet the enemy, depend upon it we
shall give a good account of them. A braver
man than Perry never stepped on the
quarter-deck
of a ship; and I will venture to affirm that
every officer and man in the squadron, is as brave
as himself. We will all become meat for the
fresh-water fishes, before we suffer the American
flag to be dishonored. I shall write again as soon
as I have any intelligence to communicate; till
then, adieu.

September
10, 1813.
My dear Boy
,
The last eastern mail has brought us the
welcome
news of
Another Naval Victory
, the
particulars
of which I will relate as far as they have
been made public, before I descend to local and
domestic subjects.
On the fifth instant, the United States brig
Enterprise sailed from Portsmouth under the
command
of lieutenant Burrows, a young officer who
served in the Mediterranean with honor and
success
,
during our contention with the Barbary
powers. On the next day, which was Sunday,
she fell in with an English brig of equal force,
called the Boxer, commanded by captain Blythe,
who immediately ordered his colors nailed to the
mast, fired a shot as a challenge, and bore down
upon the Enterprise. The action commenced
within half-pistol-shot, and was obstinately
maintained
for about three quarters of an hour, when
the enemy cried for quarter, declaring that their
colors were nailed, and could not be struck.
The gallant Burrows had been mortally
wounded, by a musket ball, at the
commencement
of the battle, but refused to be taken from
the deck, where he continued during the whole of
the action, exhorting his officers to do their duty,
and never suffer the flag to be struck. When the
sword of his brave enemy was presented to him,
he clasped his hands together and exclaimed
I am satisfiedI die contented. He was then
carried below, and shortly after expired. Captain
Blythe, of the Boxer, was also killed, being
struck with a cannon ball. This gallant officer
was one of the pall-bearers at the funeral of the
unfortunate Lawrence, in Halifax.
After the fall of Burrows, the command of
the Enterprise devolved on lieutenant M`Call,
whose cool and determined courage throughout
the action, has received the warmest approbation
of every officer on board. He conducted the prize
into Portland on Monday last, and on the
following
day, the bodies of Burrows and Blythe were
intombed with military honors. Burrows was in
the twenty-eighth year of his age, and has left
two amiable sisters to lament his loss.
The bodies of captain Lawrence, and
lieutenant
Ludlow, arrived at the navy-yard, (in
Charleston, near Boston) on the third instant,
having been brought from Halifax by captain
Crowninshield, of Salem, at his own expense, for
the purpose of bestowing on them funeral honors
in their native country. On captain
Crowninshield's
return to Salem with the bodies of these
heroes, they were publicly interred with every
honor that a grateful town could bestow. In the
mean time, Edward N. Coxe, esq. brother-in-law
of Lawrence, proceeded to Salem for the purpose
of receiving and conveying to New-York, the
remains
of that beloved and universally lamented
hero.
On arriving at the Navy-Yard, the bodies
were placed in covered waggons, and proceeded
by land to New-York. This mode of conveyance
became necessary, in consequence of the refusal
of captain Oliver, who now commands the British
squadron off New-London, (commodore Hardy
having sailed for Halifax) to comply with the
request
made by commodore Decatur, that the
bodies might be permitted to proceed round to
New-York from Salem, in the cartel which brought
them from Halifax. Such refusal was unworthy
a brave enemy, and forms a striking contrast to
the generous magnanimity which has
characterized
our naval commanders during the present
war.
I arrived in this town on the thirtieth ultimo,
after a very pleasant journey. On parting with
you at Niagara, I proceeded to Batavia, where I
tarried that night, and on the night following slept
at Bloomfield, about thirty-six miles further. The
next day at sunset, I crossed Cayuga Ferry, and
took lodgings in the village, which is beautifully
situated on the eastern margin of Cayuga lake.
On taking a survey, the next morning, of the
delightful
scenery which surrounds this lake, I felt
a strong desire to enjoy a sail on its pure and
limpid bosom. This inclination for an aquatic
excursion, was not, I assure you, much diminished
by recollecting that the village of Ithaca was
situated at the southern extremity of this inviting
sheet of water, which is about forty miles in
length, varying from one to four in breadth.
I soon struck a bargain with the owner of a
handsome little pleasure-boat, who agreed to take
me and my baggage to the head of the lake, while
my young Jehu was directed to proceed to Ithaca
with the waggon, along the Aurora turnpike, on
the eastern shore. The wind was fair, and the
day fine. We set sail about eight o'clock, and a
more charming excursion I think I never enjoyed.
The shore of this lake is considerably indented,
and pleasingly irregular; in some places
terminating
in pecipices, but in general about ten or
twelve feet high, with unbroken acclivities that
rise from one to two hundred feet in about half a
mile from the lake. The scenery, on each side,
is beautifully picturesque, and is interspersed with
little thriving villages that give it a very pleasing
effect. I noticed Romulus and Ovid on the west,
and Scipio, Aurora, Levana, and Genoa, on the
east. In the town of Scipio, on the lake shore,
stands the old Cayuga castle, the residence of the
Cayuga Indians. Each of these villages, I was
informed by the boatmen, contain a respectable
academy, and a well selected library, and either
of them must be an eligible situation for the
education
of youth, being far retired from the
fascinations
and luxuries of a city life, and blest with
every charm within the gift of nature.
I discharged my boat, and entered Ithaca
about four o'clock in the afternoon, waited on
Mrs. Woodcock immediately, and found
Catharine
much improved in health. The roses were
again beginning to bloom on her cheek, but are, I
presume, frequently watered from her eyes. Her
whole countenance was lighted with pleasure on
seeing me, and she confessed that she had not,
since the death of her mother, felt so happy as she
did for the two days I tarried in Ithaca.
On taking leave of the hospitable family
under
whose protection Catharine remains, I
proceeded
to Homer, in the county of Cortland;
thence to Sherburne, in Chenango county, and
from thence to Cherry-Valley, in Otsego county.
This village is beautifully situated in the principal
vale of a large township bearing the same name,
and is most romantically environed by high hills.
Almost all the principal roads in the state of
New-York
intersect each other at this village, which
gives it a great amount of trade and opulence.
On leaving Cherry-Valley, I passed through
Sharon
,
Cobelskill, Duanesburg, and Albany. Then
took the great eastern road through Greenbush,
43
New-Lebanon Springs, and entered my native
state in the town of Hancock. I then proceeded
through Pittsfield, Northampton, Worcester and
Cambridge, to Boston, where I arrived in safety,
and found all our friends in good health.
While I was at Ithaca, Mr. Woodcock related
to me a circumstance that deserves recording in
your journal, if you have not already noticed it.
You have doubtless heard Fleming mention a
relative
of his family named O'Fling, who assisted
in establishing our independence, by serving
through the revolutionary war as a
private soldier
,
from motives of patriotism alone. Some time last
January, he repaired to a rendezvous at Batavia,
with
four
of his sons, who all enlisted (together
with their father) as privates in the United States
army, for five years.
This instance of disinterested patriotism, is
not, however, without a parallel. About a month
after the foregoing event, one of the venerable
heroes of Saratoga and his four sons presented
themselves at the rendezvous of lieutenant
Loring
,
in Burlington, (Vt.) for the purpose of
enlisting
under the banners of their country. `I
thought,' says the aged veteran, `that we had
taught Britain a lesson that she would not have
forgotten in my day, but we will show her that a
nation of freemen is irresistible. I was then what
my boys are now, yet am still able to push a
bayonet in defence of my injured country!'
Heath is the name of these worthies. They all
resided in Johnstonthe eldest son is thirty-one,
the youngest nineteen years of age.
Spare no pains to obtain some intelligence of
Fleming. Write often, and believe me to be, as
heretofore, your affectionate father.
E. WILLOUGHBY.Sandusky Bay
,
Sept.
16, 1813.
You was right, my dear Willoughby
Revenge
will not remedy the evil
. British blood
has flowed in torrents, and still I am the last
remaining
twig on our family tree; nor can all the
blood that flows in English veins, resuscitate the
other branches, or restore my lost happiness.
We have had a battle, and hundreds of
Englishmen
are laid lowmany of them beneath the
waters
of Erie. The survivors are our prisoners,
and I have conversed with many of them who
would willingly die for their country, but who
loudly condemn the conduct of those ministers
whose ambition has plunged them into a war
with their brethren. It is the blood of such men,
the blood of our brethren, that has so lavishly
crimsoned the waves of this lake, and their
blood will cry for vengeance on those ambitious
wretches who guide the counsels of England.
You was rightthese men, whom I have been so
eager to destroy, do `commiserate my sufferings,
and denounce the authors of them.' Every
English groan that has saluted my ears since the
battle, has caused me to confess`that was not
the voice which decreed my brother's death; that
man had no hand in dragging me on board a
British ship; he never employed an Indian to
murder my sister; why then should I rejoice at
his
sufferings?' I do not; I am a convert to your
doctrine, and my present tenderness to those poor
wounded men who are placed under my care,
shall in some measure atone for my former error.
On the tenth instant, early in the morning,
while we were lying in Put-in-Bay, a man from
the mast-head cried out
a fleet!
The signal
was immediately made for getting under weigh,
and our squadron then beat out of the bay, to
meet the enemy's, which we perceived consisted
of two ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one
sloop, with their larboard tacks on board,
standing
to the south, under easy sail. The wind was,
at this time, about south-west, and we manuvred
in such a manner as to preserve the weathergage
of the enemy. At ten o'clock the signal was
made for forming in line of battle, when the
Lawrence
led the van, with the schooners Ariel and
Scorpion, on our weather bow. We were
followed
in succession by the Caledonia, Niagara,
Porcupine, Somers, Tigress, and Tripp. The
ship Detroit led the enemy's van, followed by
the Hunter, Queen Charlotte, Lady Prevost,
Chippeway, and Little Belt.
All was now profound silence on board both
squadrons; the wind was light, and we slowly
approached each other in awful majesty.
Suddenly
,
(and unexpectedly to every man in the
squadron except a few officers on board our brig)
a large Union Jack was run up to our mast head,
on which could be distinctly read throughout the
fleet, the dying words of that hero whose name
this vessel bears
Don't give up the ship
.
At sight of it, such a burst of feeling arose from
every bosom, as might almost have been heard
from Erie to Malden.
At about eleven o'clock the exhilirating
notes of a bugle sounded from the enemy's van
ship, which was followed by reiterated huzzas
from the crews of the different vessels in their
squadron.
About noon we had approached within a
mile and a half of each other, when the Detroit,
which mounted long guns, opened a heavy fire
upon the Lawrence, which we were unable to
return, owing to the shortness of ours. Without
waiting for the schooners, which now fell astern,
our commodore kept on his course in such a
gallant
and determined style, that the enemy
supposed
it was our intention to board. Having gained
a nearer position, Perry directed us to return the
enemy's fire; but the length of their guns gave
them greatly the advantage, enabling them to
place a shot just where they pleased, while ours
fell short of them; thus the poor Lawrence was
pierced through and through, with a third of her
crew disabled, before we could make the enemy
feel a single shot.
It now evidently appeared, that the plan of
the British commodore was to destroy this ship,
and thus throw the squadron into confusion. For
that purpose the fire of all his heaviest guns
was directed at the Lawrence alone, leaving our
other vessels unmolested. Signal was now made
for closing with the enemy, but this ship soon
became
so crippled that she was perfectly
unmanageable
,
43*
every brace and bowline being cut
away, and in this situation we sustained the fight
for above two hours, and for a great part of that
time, could only get three or four guns to bear
upon the foe. In the mean time, our men were
rapidly cut down at their quarters, while others
stept into their places, to share the same fate.
The wounded were carried below, but the dead
remained where they fell. Our ship was reduced
to a mere wreck; the decks were streaming with
blood, and covered with mangled limbs and dead
bodies. One gun after another was dismounted,
and the commodore himself assisted to work the
last that could be fired.
Finding, at length, that we could no longer
annoy the enemy from this ship, the gallant
commodore
directed a boat to be lowered from the
stern, and manned; he then ordered his union
jack to be hauled down, which he deliberately
placed under his arm, gave the command of the
Lawrence to lieutenant Yarnell, and sprang into
the boat, directing his men to pull for the Niagara,
which was then hotly engaged. He first,
however
,
called to the pilot, and told him that he
might either accompany him or remain on board
the Lawrence. I will stick by you to the last!
exclaimed the brave fellow, and leaped into the
boat after his commander. Pull away, my brave
boys! exclaimed the hero, gallantly waving his
sword, standing erect in the stern of the boat,
while the balls whistled around him like a shower
of hail. An old sailor, who had been in both
battles of the Constitution, entreated him to be
seated, and finally forcibly pulled him down from
his elevated situation. For a moment the enemy's
fire was diverted from this devoted ship, and
directed against the little bark which we now
watched in breathless anxiety. But in vain were
whole broadsides levelled at itin vain the whole
musketry of two vessels were poured around it
that little bark contained a greater than Csar,
and passed through a shower of shot without
receiving
one on board. In a few minutes we hailed
with transport his inspiring flag hoisted at the
mast-head of the Niagara, and beheld that noble
brig, dash, like a demon of vengeance, through
the enemy's line, raking right and left as she past,
pouring destruction on every side. In the next
moment she was lying yard-arm and yard-arm
with the British commodore. The smaller vessels
followed in order, under the direction of Elliot,
and the contest began to assume a more
promising
aspect.
In the mean time, the Lawrence (having
sustained
the whole fury of the enemy) was wholly
incapable of any further defence, and a show of
resistance was only drawing destruction on the
relics of our mangled crew, many of whom were
killed in the steerage while under the surgeon's
hands. The brave Yarnell, therefore, ordered
our flag to be struck, and our brig hauled out of
the line; but the enemy being now too closely
engaged to take possession of us, our flag was
again hoisted, while the red-cross of England
descended, in succession, on board of every vessel
in the enemy's squadron, except two small ones
who attempted to escape, but were chased and
brought back by two of our small craft.
Thus, by the unparalleled skill and bravery
of Perry, (whom every officer and seaman
acknowledges
to be the saviour, under Heaven, of
the American squadron) we find ourselves in
possession
of the ship Detroit, of twenty guns, large
twenty-four pounders; ship Queen Charlotte, of
nineteen guns; brig Hunter, of ten guns; schooner
Lady Prevost, of twelve guns; schooner
Chippeway
,
of one gun; and the sloop Little Belt, of
two guns. So that the American squadron is
increased
by the addition of six vessels and
sixty-four
guns, while the enemy have not a single gun
afloat on this lake.
The engagement lasted about three hours,
and never was victory more decisive and
complete
.
The captured squadron, you perceive,
exceeds ours in number of guns as well as weight
of metal; their crews were more numerous, and
more prisoners were taken than we had men to
guard them. The loss on both sides is severe;
scarcely a man on board this brig has escaped
unhurt. I have, myself, however, fortunately
come off with a mere scratch in the breast, where
a splinter struck me. On board the Lawrence
there were twenty-two killed and sixty-one
wounded, although thirty-one of our crew were
on the sick list, and unfit for duty. Our total loss
throughout the squadron is twenty-seven killed,
and ninety-six woundeda pretty strong
evidence
that our brig bore the brunt of the action.
The day before the action, there were one
hundred
and sixteen men in the squadron reported
unfit for duty.
I am unable to state the loss of the enemy; it
must, however, have been immense, as several of
their vessels are literally cut to pieces; so much
so, that the masts of the two ships were all carried
away by the board, in a slight gale after the battle,
owing to their being so severely wounded in the
action. Barclay, the British commodore, has done
himself great honor by the gallant manner in
which he fought his squadron. Twice was he
carried below on account of his wounds, and as
often returned again upon deck. Little did I
think, when compelled to fight under this same
brave officer, in the battle of Trafalgar, that I
should ever fight against him. But so it is
There is a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will.
I was also in an engagement with him afterwards,
with a French ship, when he lost his arm. He is
a fine-looking officer, about thirty-six years old,
and has seen much service. A shot from our ship
deprived him of his remaining hand.
The first care of our humane commodore, after
the battle, was to attend to the comfort of the
suffering crews of both squadrons. The sick and
wounded are taken care of in the most tender
manner, and the officers who have fallen on both
sides, were buried last Sunday morning with the
honors of war, on an island in the lake.
The prisoners have been landed at Sandusky,
and Perry has requested Harrison to have them
marched to Chilicothe, until the pleasure of
government respecting them is known. Perry is
now on board the Ariel, and Yarnell has been
directed to take the Lawrence to Erie, with all
the wounded of our fleet, as this ship is so cut up,
that it will not be safe to keep her on the lake
until repaired.
By this time I suppose you are anxious to see
the names of those who have distinguished
themselves
on this occasion. Well, then, attend.
Next to the god-like Perry, (whose exalted merits
are far above the reach of any commendation my
humble pen can bestow) stands the gallant Elliott,
and the greatest praise that can be bestowed on
either of these heroes, is to say, that each of them
was himself
he that is more, is more than man.
When Perry arrived on board of the Niagara,
after leaving his own ship, Elliott discovered
that an important part of the fleet had assumed
improper positions, and immediately
volunteered
his services to pass the whole of the enemy's
line, bring up these vessels, and place them in a
position better calculated to annoy the enemy.
The gallant offer was accepted; and Elliott
passed down the whole line, in a small boat,
while the enemy's fire was so incessant, that his
clothes were wet by the water which was dashed
on him by the balls that fell around his boat. In
this manner he proceeded to our gun-boats, and
ordered them to make sail, and follow him; they
did so, and he placed them under the sterns of
the enemy's two heaviest ships, which placed the
latter between two raking fires, and accelerated
their surrender.
His eye was every where, and he soon
observed
that the guns of the Somers were not well
served nor properly pointed; he therefore went
on board that vessel, and fired the
thirty-two-pounder
three times himself, while Perry had
brought the Niagara into the midst of the
enemy's
line, where she was spouting fire from both
sides at once. These manuvres decided the
contest.
Next to Elliott, I will mention the undaunted
Yarnell, who, though several times wounded,
refused
to quit the deck. The officers, generally,
wore short-jackets, to prevent their being picked
off by the enemy's sharp shooters; and Yarnell
was also dressed as a common sailor. A red
bandanna
handkerchief was tied round his neck, and
another round his head, to stanch two wounds he
had received. From these the blood trickled
down his face, and a splinter having passed
through his nose, it had swelled to a hideous
magnitude
.
In this frightful plight, looking like
the very genius of carnage and ill luck, he came
up to Perry, in the hottest and bloodiest of the
fight, and announced to him that all the officers
of his division were killed. Perry ordered others
in their place. Shortly after, Yarnell returned
with a repetition of the dismal tidings, that all
the officers were shot down: `Then, sir,' said
Perry, `you must endeavor to make out by
yourself
.
I have no more to furnish you.' Perry
escaped unhurt, as did also his brother, a young
midshipman on board the Lawrence.
Webster, as I predicted, `acted well his part,
and there all the honor lies.' He acted as sailing
master on board the Niagara, and in breaking the
enemy's line, no officer ever excelled him. Even
the enemy have extolled the gallant style in which
the Niagara was brought into close action, and the
name of Webster has been publicly commended
by the commodore. The young hero now acts
as lieutenant, and Perry has assured him that the
first mail from Washington will furnish him with
a commission bearing date the tenth of this month.
Thus may bravery ever be rewarded.
The following officers are spoken of as
having
signalized themselves on this brilliant
occasion
:
lieutenants Brooks, Smith, Edwards,
Turner
,
and Packet; midshipmen Forest, Lamb,
Clarke, Claxton, and Swartwout; sailing master
Taylor and Champlin; pursers M`Grath and
Hambleton; and captain Brevoort, of the army,
who acted as a volunteer, in the capacity of a
marine officer, on board the Niagara, and did
great execution with his rifle. Brooks, Lamb,
and Clarke, are fallen, no more to rise.
Hambleton
,
who volunteered his services on deck,
was severely wounded, late in the action.
Claxton
and Swartwout are also badly wounded.
So much for officersbut heroism is not
always
distinguished by an epaulet. A seaman
named Hall, in one of the gun-boats, observing
the last remaining sponge fall overboard, without
which the long gun would have been useless,
plunged into the waves and caught ithis
comrades
seized the end of the sponge and drew him
on board, and then again poured away into the
enemy.
James Bird, son of J. Bird, of Exeter, in
the state of New-Hampshire, was on board the
Lawrence, and did his duty like a hero. His
comrades fell thick around him, but he stood at
his post firm and undismayed. At length a
canister
shot struck him on the shoulder, as he was
stooping to his gun, and he was instantly covered
with blood. His officer ordered him below, but
he ventured to disobey, preferring to do his duty
while he had life, to abandoning his post. The
blood flowed so fast, that another order was issued
to go below; when he ran down, got a hasty
bandage on the wound, and returned again upon
deck. Although his left arm was now useless,
yet he handed cartridges, and performed every
service in his power, with his right, until the stars
and stripes waved gloriously over the foe.
Two Indian Chiefs had been stationed in the
tops of the Detroit, to pick off our officers with
their rifles. No sooner, however, did the ships
come into close action, than they were dismayed
by this new and tremendous species of battle,
and slunk into the hold. When the ship was
taken, they anticipated cruel treatment, if their
nation was discovered, and therefore borrowed
sailors' clothes, that they might pass for
Englishmen
.
Thus disguised, they lay in close
concealment
for two days, when word was brought to
Perry, that two Indians were concealed below,
who had not tasted food for eight-and-forty hours.
He had them brought up on deck, where they
made a most uncouth and ludicrous appearance,
with their borrowed garments bagging about
them. They expected nothing less than to be
butchered and scalped; but, notwithstanding,
preserved the most taciturn inflexibility of muscle.
Perry, however, after putting a few good
humoured
questions to them, ordered them to be taken
away and fed; a degree of lenity which seemed
to strike them with more surprise than their stoic
natures are apt to evince.
Our surgeon relates an anecdote which may
serve to show the cool intrepidity of our seamen,
and their propensity to extract amusement from
the most frivolous incidenteven amid the
horrors
of a sanguinary battle. That part of the
Lawrence which was appropriated for the
purpose
of a cockpit, was exposed to the enemy's
shot, and there the wounded and dying lay strewn
about in such numbers, that the feet of the surgeon
sank in blood and gore, which had acquired the
consistency of mud. We had a dog on board, and
confined him to this place during the action, that
44
he might not be in the way on deck. At every
new discharge of the enemy's guns, he howled
most pitiously for mercy; but as soon as a partial
silence succeeded, he would growl and bark
defiance
at the enemy. A shot at length opened
day-light
on that scene of gloom and horror, when the
dog immediately thrust his head through the
shot-hole
and howled for quarters. The strange
conduct
of this terrified animal, the surgeon assures
me, so diverted the wounded and dying, that they
burst into loud and intemperate peals of laughter.
Your relation, Mr. Latamore, of Erie, is now
on board this vessel; he sets out on his return
home to-morrow, and has promised to forward
this letter to you with all convenient haste. We
proceed for the same place immediately, but as
the wind is ahead, he will
outsail
us on horseback.
He informs me that young Croghan has been
rewarded
for his gallantry at Fort Sandusky, in the
best possible way that a young hero could wish
to be rewardedby the fair. The ladies of
Chilicothe, it appears, have presented him an
elegant sword, as a testimony of their respect for
his bravery and patriotism; and government has
promoted him to the rank of colonel. Adieu.
WILLIAM O'HARA.Erie, Pa.
October
20, 1813.
Good news, my dear Willoughby! Detroit,
Sandwich, Maldenall that Hull and you lost,
and all that you might have takenis now in
possession
of the Americans. Tecumseh is slain,
Proctor fled, and the British army captured, with
all their camp equipage and their leader's private
baggage. Harrison is the hero who has achieved
all this, by the valor of the brave troops under his
command. I have just conversed with an officer
who served as a volunteer in this brilliant affair,
and he has furnished me with the following
particulars
:
As soon as Harrison was informed of our
victory
on the lake, he concentrated his whole army
at the mouth of Portage river, near Sandusky Bay,
at which place he was joined, on Friday, the
seventeenth of September, by the venerable
governor
of Kentucky (his excellency Isaac Shelby)
with four thousand well mounted volunteers. This
grey-headed veteran, now upwards of sixty-years
old, volunteered to serve under Harrison during
his intended expedition to Malden. Harrison
gratefully accepted the patriotic proposal, and
requested him to retain the command of his own
volunteers which should constitute the right wing
of the invading army. The works at Fort Meigs
being now reduced (as mentioned in my letter
dated the eighteenth of August) general M`Arthur
marched from that post with his brigade, and
joined
the main body also.
On Tuesday, the twenty-first ultimo, the army
began to embark on board the squadron, and in
the course of the week were all transported to a
cluster of islands within twelve miles of Malden;
where, on the Monday following, they were again
received by the American flotilla, consisting of
sixteen vessels of war and upwards of one
hundred
boats. In the afternoon of the same day the
troops were all landed in good order, on the
enemy's
shore, three miles below Malden. Colonel
R. M. Johnson, (who had signalized himself
during
the siege of Fort Meigs) had been previously
ordered to proceed with his regiment to Detroit
by land, where he arrived on Wednesday, the
twenty-ninth.
As soon as general Proctor was informed of
the approach of the American army, an event
which he expected after the battle on the lake, he
prepared to abandon Maldenand accordingly,
set fire to the fort, destroyed all the public
property
,
and retreated with his army along the
banks of the Thames, towards the interior of
Upper
Canada, accompanied by Tecumseh, with his
red forces. The ruins of the fort, barracks, and
other public buildings, were still smoking when
the American army entered Malden, and a
number
of females came out to meet the general as he
approached the town, and implored his
protection
.
It was not Cockburn to whom they thus
appealed. The violated females of Hampton
passed in rapid review through the hero's mind,
and he exclaimedYes, fair suppliants, I will
protect you with my life; instant death shall be
his fate who presumes to treat one of you with
disrespect. I have come to conquernot to
oppress
;
to disarm assassinsnot to assail the
peaceful. You may rely upon our protection.
Thus having secured the hearts of the ladies, the
men were easily prevailed upon to receive their
new masters. The inhabitants received every
indulgence that could be granted or wished.
The next day the Americans proceeded to
Sandwich, crossed the river, and entered Detroit,
which had been left by the British in possession
of the Indians, who now fled with the greatest
precipitation
.
Here they were received by the
distressed
inhabitants with the most rapturous
acclamations
of joy, and Harrison was hailed by them
as the angel of their deliverance. They had been
subjected to the caprice of tyrants of the worst
kind; their property had been at the disposal of
the British and Indians, and a word, or even a
look, would sometimes forfeit it. The bare
mention
of a rumor unfavorable to the British cause,
or the slightest interference in favor of their
unfortunate
countrymen in captivity, subjected them
to imprisonment in the guard-house or the
dungeon
to
banishment from their homes, or to
severities
of even a worse nature. No wonder,
then, that when the American troops landed, they
hailed them as their deliverers.
M`Arthur's brigade first crossed the river,
and there were, at that time, about six hundred
Indians encamped at the back of the town,
employed
in cooking victuals and jerking beef, all of
45
which they left in their haste to escape, and thus
the Americans were furnished with a supply of
provisions that lasted several days.
Colonel Johnson having now arrived with
his regiment, Harrison determined to pursue the
retreating enemy up the river Thames;
notwithstanding
he was then four days' march in
advance
.
He accordingly directed M`Arthur to
occupy Detroit with his brigade, and on Saturday,
the second of October, commenced the pursuit,
and marched thirty miles before he halted. The
patriotic Shelby led on his own brave mounted
volunteers; and the gallant Desha headed a
brigade
of infantry. Colonel Ball and major Wood,
who had both been promoted for their bravery in
the defence of Fort Meigs, were also engaged in
the present pursuit. Supported by such men,
could Harrison do less than conquer? But these
were not all. Perry, the hero of Erie, volunteered
his services as aid to the commander in chief, and
so did general Cass, who was once a colonel in
Hull's army. John Speed Smith and John
Chambers, esquires, also volunteered their
services
for the same purpose. Captain Todd and
lieutenant O'Fallon were the general's regular
aids-de-camp.
On Tuesday, the fifth, after some successful
skirmishes with the savages, who opposed their
advance, the eager Americans overtook their
retreating
enemy, whose progress had been retarded
by the baggage of their chief, who was so
over-loaded
with plunder that his carriage proceeded
very heavily along. Finding himself reduced to the
alternative of yielding or fighting, Proctor chose
the latter, as thereby he might possibly preserve
his pilfered booty, or at least save his own dear
person from captivity. For after his treatment
of the Americans in his power, he felt that he had
no right to expect mercy from them, should the
scale be turned against him.
He was now about four miles ahead of
Harrison
,
and had made a stand, in a very
advantageous
position, on an open field, approachable only
by a narrow plain between the river and a swamp.
Notwithstanding the fatigue which his army had
endured in forced marches, Harrison
determined
to make an immediate attack. Knowing that
the American
back-woods-men
ride better in the
woods than any other peoplethat a rifle or
musket
is no impediment to them, and that they can
fire as accurately on horseback as on foot, he
determined
to assail the enemy in a manner entirely
new, and, of course, to them entirely unexpected.
Having, therefore, arranged the mounted infantry
in suitable columns for making a
galloping
charge,
he ordered them to advance, receive the enemy's
fire, and then break his line, while the foot were
to follow, and support them in the conflict.
As they emerged from the wood, in front of
the British line, a general discharge of musketry
assailed them, which caused many of the horses
to recoil, and a temporary disorder was produced.
Another fire was received, and the noble animals
gained confidence, were soon put in motion, and
in a few moments the British line was pierced by
upwards of one thousand horsemen, armed with
muskets, who dashed through with irresistible
speed, striking down or trampling under foot all
opponents; and having killed and wounded
upwards
of fifty in the charge, instantly formed in
the rear, wheeled to the
right about
, and renewed
the attack. Such a panic did this novel mode of
modern warfare strike into the astonished
Englishmen
,
that all resistance was abandoned, and
four hundred and seventy-two soldiers threw
down their arms, and surrendered themselves
prisoners of war, together with three colonels and
two majors.
Proctor instantly perceived that the day was
lost; and (trembling for the fate which his
barbarities
merited) thought only of effecting his own
escape and the preservation of his private
baggage
.
He therefore left his followers to their
fate, and fled in his carriage, under a strong
escort
of dragoons.
Not so Tecumseh, who headed about twelve
hundred Indians on the left. His line had been
assailed in a similar mode, by two columns under
colonel Johnson, and still remained unbroken.
He disdained to fly or yield like his trembling
allies, and having posted his warriors in the best
possible positions to repulse an attack, firmly
maintained his ground. Johnson then ordered
his columns to dismount, and charge on foot, when
a most desperate and sanguinary conflict took
place; Tecumsch's line was broken, and his
undaunted
band were charged front and rear. The
Indians, however, were not dismayed, but quickly
collecting their principal strength upon the right,
they made an attempt to penetrate the line of
infantry under the gallant Desha. At that
moment
the venerable Shelby pressed forward with
a regiment to the support of his friend, and the
Indians were compelled to fall back.
Meanwhile, Johnson was in the hottest of the
fight, and his blood was gushing from him in five
different streams, dying with a crimson hue the
milk-white charger on which he was mounted.
Covered with blood, and faint with pain and
fatigue, he now encountered the redoubtable
Teeumseh
,
arm to arm.
Then came the tug of war.
The moment the savages beheld their chief
thus engaged, a shower of bullets was poured
upon his assailant, piercing his coat, hat, and
accoutrements
,
without, however, injuring his
person
.
Tecumseh levelled his rifle and firedhis
aim was unerring, but as he pulled the trigger his
opponent's horse plunged, and the ball whistled
harmless by him. The desperate warrior now
sprang forward with his tomahawkhis eye
flashed fire, and he seemed to increase in stature,
as he raised his arm, to throw the deadly weapon,
collecting all his energy into one dreadful effort.
At that moment his brave opponent's horse
received
a wound, and staggered back, while his
rider drew a pistol and shot Tecumseh through
the head. The victor fainted in the act, and both
fell together, mingling their streaming blood on
the ground.
But the wounds of the victorious colonel were
not mortal; he was speedily removed from the
scene of slaughter, while major Thompson
assumed
the command of his column, and the
battle
continued to rage for nearly an hour, when
the savages were put to flight, and the Americans
remained masters of the field. Harrison, who had
been in every part of the action, now gave orders
for the wounded of both armies to receive every
humane attention that situation and circumstances
would permit.

When Proctor fled from the field of battle, he
was closely pursued by a squadron of horse; but
his superior knowledge of the country, and the
speed of his horses, enabled him to effect his
escape. His baggage, however, which was very
valuable, and all his private papers, fell into the
hands of his pursuers, and were brought to
Harrison
,
after the battle.
Among the trophies of this brilliant victory,
were six pieces of brass artillery, three of which
were the same pieces which Dearborn assisted in
taking from Burgoyne, at Saratoga, during the
revolutionary war, and which were surrendered
by Hull at Detroit, at the commencement of the
present. Harrison has also taken two iron
twenty-four
pounders, and upwards of five thousand
stand of small arms. The enemy had no
standard
in the field, or it would also have been taken.
Many officers distinguished themselves in
this battle. Colonel R. M. Johnson, I have
already
mentioned. Cass and Perry were at every
point where they could be useful. Shelby
exhibited
all the vigor of youth, the same ardent zeal
which distinguished him in the revolutionary war,
and the same undaunted bravery which he
manifested
at King's Mountain. Though the
governor
of an independent state, yet for the good of
his country, he voluntarily placed himself under
the command of an officer far his junior in years,
and was not more remarkable for his courage,
zeal, and activity, than for the promptitude and
cheerfulness with which he obeyed his general's
orders. Major-generals Desha and Henry, and
brigadiers Allen, Caldwell, King, Chiles, and
Trotter, all of the Kentucky volunteers, covered
themselves with laurels. General Adaip and
lieutenant-colonel
James Johnson, rendered
themselves
conspicuous by their bravery and skill;
as did, also, colonels M`Dowell, and Walker, of
Shelby's staff. Major Wood and previously
distinguished
himself at Fort Meigs, and on this
occasion
he added new laurels to his brow. Majors
Barry, Crittenden, Payne, and Thompson, were
both zealous and active in the discharge of every
hazardous duty assigned them; while captain
Butler, captain Todd, and lieutenant O'Fallon
were equally emulous in the discharge of theirs.
Harrison has expressed his warmest approbation
of the conduct of Smith and Chambers, the two
gentlemen who volunteered as his aids. In short,
sir, every man did his duty, and every man is
entitled
to a share of the glory which was on that
day so brilliantly shed on the American arms.
The fifth of October should hereafter be kept by
Americans as a festival.
When my informant left Malden, Harrison
was about to embark for Buffalo, with all his
disposable
force, and you may expect him at Fort
George by the first of November. Adieu.

Be not alarmed, my daughter, that this letter
is not written by your father's hand. That hand
is, alas! too much enfeebled by disease to hold
a pen; I have, therefore, employed that of my
most excellent friend, captain Miller, who has
generously offered to make a journey to Ithaca
for the sole purpose of conveying to you the last
injunctions and blessing of your affectionate
father
.
O let me fly to him instantly! exclaimed
the distressed girl, rising and advancing to the
messenger. He will die among strangers, and
I shall never see him. Let us go immediately!
Be composed, my love, replied her aunt.
Your father may not be so dangerously ill as
you imagine. At any rate, you must not think
of undertaking such a journey alone, and you
know I am unable to accompany you.
Let me intreat you to be more composed,
Miss Fleming, said captain Miller,
affectionately
taking her hand. Endeavor to summon
sufficient
fortitude to finish reading that letter, and
then I will speak further of your father.
After a short struggle with her tears, Catharine
could again distinguish the characters on the
paper she held, and thus continued to read
My long captivity, close confinement, and
sorrow of heart, have all conspired to destroy
my constitution; and my health is now so much
impaired, that I have very little hopes of its
restoration. Several of your letters reached me
in Canada, and each of them afforded me
comfort
,
except that in which you mentioned the
illness
of my sister. But we must learn to be
resigned
to every event that may befal us, and hope
for our reward in another life.
Be attentive to your aunt, my child, while
she is spared to you, for I fear that you are
destined
to be an orphan. I dare not say how
ardently I wish to see you, because the journey
is of such prodigious length. Captain Miller,
(under whose hospitable roof I meet the most
delicate attention) insists upon visiting you in his
own carriage, and making you the companion of
his return. I have objected to laying any
member
of my family under such an immense
obligation
to a friend; but in this proposition he is so
earnestly seconded by his amiable sister, who
wishes to accompany him, that I have finally
consented
for them to make the journey, leaving it
to your own discretion, whether it will be
prudent
to undertake so arduous a task in the
present
state of your health.
Should we never again meet on earth, may
the choicest blessings of Heaven attend your
steps through life, and its mercy restore you to
the embraces of your parents in another world.
Adieu, my childadieu.

Adieu, my dearest, best friendadieu, until
we meet in that world where parting will be no
more. I should feel guilty of an unpardonable
neglect, did I longer delay to inform you that I
am rapidly sinking beneath the iron hand of
affliction
.
Grief for the loss of my parents has
made such havoc with my constitution, that my
health I fear can never be again restored. I shall
never cease to love youno, not even in heaven;
next to my Saviour's, your image will be the
object
which I shall contemplate with the greatest
delight, through the boundless ages of eternity.
My greatest earthly comfort is the perusal of your
affectionate epistlesthis is the first I have ever
written to youit will be the last you must ever
expectpreserve it as a legacy of my affection.
I will not concealfor why should I?that your
presence would soothe my dying hour, and
that the transition would be sweet from your
arms to those of my attendant angels, who are
waiting to receive me. But I will not drag you
from those higher duties to which you are called
by your God and your country. Continue to
serve both faithfully, and you will one day be
again restored to your ever faithful

.U. S. Ship Saratoga,
Plattsburgh Bay
,
Sept.
13, 1814.
It is my good fortune, my dear sir, to
announce
that I have for the second time, witnessed
the glorious sight of a whole British fleet
surrendering
to the superior skill and bravery of
American
seamen. Our gallant commodore, M`
Donough
,
will now vie with Perry, while the name of
M`Comb will be coupled with those of Harrison,
Brown, Scott, Boyd, Ripley, Porter, &c. The
eleventh
of September will also shine as bright on
the page of history, as the tenth. But I will
descend
to particulars.
The enemy, for some time past, has exhibited
a disposition to invade the state of New-York, by
the way of Champlain and Plattsburgh; and, on
the first instant, actually entered the former place
with an immense army of veterans (the most of
whom had immortalized themselves in Spain and
France, under lord Wellington) led forward, in
great style, by Prevost and De Rottenberg.
From Champlain they made gradual approaches
towards Plattsburgh, where M`Comb
commanded
52
a small remnant of the right wing of the
American
armythe main body, under Izard, having
been previously ordered to Sacket's Harbor.
On arriving in the vicinity of Plattsburgh, in
full view of the unfinished and half-garrisoned
fortifications of the Americans, the enemy made
a pause, and spent five days in throwing up
breastworks for the protection of his approaches.
All this time, our flotilla lay opposite
Plattsburgh
;
but had Prevost pushed immediately
forward
,
all our exertions could not have saved
M`Comb's little army from destruction. Prevost,
however, was studying a deeper game
considering
that the defeat of this handful of men under
M`Comb as an object of comparative
insignificance
,
he wished to include our squadron in the
victory, and therefore waited all this time for the
British fleet to come up and capture us, while he
conquered the army.
Well, siron Sunday, the eleventh instant,
the British fleet
did
come up, and instantly gave
us battle; while, at the same moment, Prevost
gave battle to M`Comb, on shore. The result
was, that victory crowned the American arms in
both contests; the whole British fleet
is ours
, and
the whole British army (or as many as could effect
their escape) retreated in confusion, leaving their
sick and wounded to the mercy of the victors, and
destroying their stores to facilitate their flight.
Our squadron carried eighty-six guns, and
the British ninety-five. We had fifty-two killed,
and fifty-eight wounded; while they had
eighty-four
killed, (including their commodore,
Downie
)
and one hundred and ten wounded.
The British army, on shore, was
fourteen
thousand strong
, composed of veterans; while
that of the Americans consisted of fifteen hundred
regulars, and less than three thousand raw and
undisciplined militia. The former have lost, in
killed, wounded and missing, about two thousand
five hundred; while the Americans, during the
whole siege, have only lost thirty-seven killed,
sixty-two wounded, and twenty missing.
Insert the following names on your journal,
for they all deserve to be recorded in letters of
gold on columns of marble, for their heroic
conduct
in contending against and defeating the
boasted invincibles of Lord Wellington:
Generals
Mooers and Wright, of the New-York militia;
colonels Smith, Appling, and Miller; majors
Wooll and Totten; captain M`Glassin, Sproull,
Brooks, Vaughan, Scoville, Grosvenor, and
Youngs(the latter commanded a small
detachment
of infantry on board the squadron, acting as
marines); lieutenants Root, De Russy, Trescott,
Smyth, Mountford, Cromwell, Sumpter, Harrison,
Turner, Taylor, and Runk. The four last were
woundedRunk mortally.
Captain M`Glassin had covered himself with
glory two days previous to the battle. With a
small detachment, he forded, at midnight, the
river which separated the two armies, and
attacked
a party of the enemy who were constructing a
strong battery that would have proved very
destructive
to the American ranks; he defeated
them with great loss, destroyed the battery,
spiked
the cannon, and then returned in safety to the
American camp.
On board the squadron, we lost two brave
and valuable officerslieutenants Gamble and
Stansbury; the latter was knocked overboard and
drowned. Your friend John H. Graham, who
immortalized himself in storming the British
batteries
opposite Black Rock, where he lost a leg,
was very active on this glorious occasion; and so
was another young hero, whose name I have often
heard mentioned with admirationI mean
Nathaniel
Lawrence Montgomery, (cousin to the
immortal
Lawrence whose name he bears) who lost
a hand on board the frigate President during her
running fight with the Belvidere.

The following certificate from the gallant Porter, presented to
this patriotic young gentleman when the latter was about to sail for
Europe, is with pleasure recorded in this place:
Towards the close of the siege of Fort Erie, in September, 1814,
Mr. Delapierre visited the American camp, and remained several
days during that critical period, assisting and encouraging the
garrison
in the discharge of its arduous duties At the
sortie
, on the 17th
of September, which terminated the siege, he tendered his services
to me as volunteer aid-de-camp, and acquitted himself with great
gallantry on that occasion, and received a severe wound. So rare an
instance of patriotism and bravery, entitles this young gentleman to
the respect and consideration of every friend to his country.
New-York, July
6, 1815. P. B. PORTER.
On the
present
occasion, he volunteered his services to
M`Donough, and was very conspicuous for his
intelligence
,
activity, and courage.
Besides those I have already mentioned, the
following naval officers also distinguished
themselves
on the glorious ELEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER;
viz. Lieutenants Cassin, Valette, and Duncan
the latter was serving on shore, where he lost an
arm by a rocket; also, midshipmen Monteath,
Williamson, Platt, Thwing, and Baldwin.
Montgomery
received three trifling wounds.
As I concluded the account of Perry's
victory
with an anecdote of a dog, I will conclude that
of M`Donough with an anecdote of a game-cock,
which was on board this ship, the property of
your friend Graham. In the hottest of the battle,
this noble bird flew up the fore hatchway, and
lighted on the ship's bell, where he continued to
crow with all his might, until a cannon ball broke
the bell to pieces. He then flew up into the
rigging
,
and continued crowing until the action
ceased. This incident was hailed by the sailors
as an omen of success, and since the event has
verified
it, the bird is almost worshipped throughout
the squadron. A man might as safely kill one of
the sacred animals of the Hindoos, as to harm
Graham's game-cockan attempt of the kind
would almost raise a mutiny in the fleet.
Have you heard any thing further respecting
Fleming's detention at Quebec, and dare they try
him for treason? Write soon, and tell me
something
of my niece. Adieu.

CATHARINE WOODCOCK
.[INCLOSED IN THE FOREGOING.]
New-Orleans
,
October
4, 1814.
Be happy, my dear mother, for I have good
news to communicate. Our cousin Catharine
Fleming is safe under my protectionthe same
innocent happy being, as when we were romping
together at Ithaca. Pause, while you freely
indulge
the rapturous tears of joy, and then proceed
to particulars.
On the eleventh of September, commodore
Patterson, of the American flotilla on this station,
sailed with a small squadron on an expedition
against a gang of pirates, who have long occupied
an island in lake Barrataria, about thirty miles
from this city, and committed great depredations
on the coastcapturing the vessels of all nations
indiscriminately, and murdering the crews and
passengers. Several vessels from this port, which
were supposed to have been lost at sea, have
increased
the booty of these outlawed wretches. A
detachment of eighty men, under colonel Ross,
also, went down by land, to make a simultaneous
attack, with the squadron, on the rendezvous of
these unprincipled freebooters.
You may perhaps be ignorant that such
a fraternity ever existed in civilized America.
But such is the fact, and in the course of this letter
I shall have occasion to give a brief history of its
leader. Let it suffice, for the present, that the
expedition against them was successfultheir
strong hold was taken, together with all their
armed schooners and feluccas, and a great
quantity
of booty. The captain of this banditti,
monsieur
La Fitte, effected his escape; but
Dominique
,
the second in command, with about one
thousand of his band, were taken prisoners.
On Saturday last, the first instant, I stood on
the levee, with many of the joyful citizens, to
welcome
the victorious Patterson and Ross, on their
return from the successful enterprise; when the
unexpected sight of an elegant female, leaning on
the arm of the colonel, attracted the attention of
every spectator. My curiosity was excited, and
I advancedwhen Catharine sprang forward
uttered my name with a shriekand fainted in
my arms.
The narrow limits of a letter will not allow me
to detail all the particulars of this happy
meeting
the
exclamationssensationsagitations
interrogationsexplanationscongratulations
with my tender bride's commiserationsall these
things must be deferred for verbal
communications
.
In the mean time, however, I will give you
a brief recital of our cousin's peregrinations, since
she parted from youat least, as far as the
agitated
state of her mind has permitted her to
relate
them.
Instead of being conveyed to her sick father,
as she expected to be, she was most
treacherously
betrayed into the power of a wretch who has,
at length, expiated his crimes by death. Her
father
was still a prisoner in Quebec, and the
companions
of her journey were the base minions of
that villainous Sandford who once pretended to
have saved her life at Richmond, and afterwards
insulted her with dishonorable proposals. While
she was fainting with terror, he bore her on
board an English privateer, of which he boasted
of being part owner, having deserted from the
American army, and espoused the British cause.
To what part of the world he intended to
convey her, Catharine could never understand.
as the greater part of the time she was on board
the privateer, she was suffering under a raging
fever, accompanied with fits of raving delirium,
during which she would suffer no one to approach
her but a black boy who waited on the captain.
However severe this additional calamity may
seem, it was probably permitted by Heaven to
secure her from the insults of her abandoned
persecutor
.
On the fifth of August, at about ten o'clock in
the morning, a thick fog, which had hung about
them for more than two days, suddenly broke
away, when they discovered two armed vessels,
under American colors, within musket shot. To
escape was impossible, and the privateer was
therefore cleared for action. A desperate and
sanguinary conflict now took place, which
continued
above three hours, when captain Miller
and his first lieutenant being both slain, the next
officer ordered the British flag to be struck, and
surrendered the privateer as a prize to the two
hostile schooners. She was immediately boarded
from both, and the cowardly Sandford, having
now crawled upon deck, tendered his sword to the
ferocious-looking officer who headed the
boarders
.
The weapon was received, and instantly
thrust through the wretched prisoner's heart, who
fell lifeless on the deck. This was the signal
for an indiscriminate slaughter, and every man
belonging to the privateer soon floated a
breathless
corpse in the deep. The black boy alone
escaped, who concealed himself in the hold, and
on being discovered after the massacre, was
permitted
to live.
Fortunately for Catharine, she was
insensible
to all these dreadful transactions, and
learned
them afterwards from the boy. On
recovering
her recollection, she found herself in bed on
shore, with a black woman and the boy
watching
by her pillow, who both testified the most
lively joy, on hearing her speak in a calm and
rational manner. Her fever was now broken,
but she was extremely weak, and it was several
days before her physician, who was also black,
would allow her to converse, although she was
laboring with the most painful curiosity to learn
the particulars of her situation. At length,
however
,
her nurse was permitted to answer her eager
inquiries, who informed her, with the greatest
caution, that she was on an island called
Barrataria
,
which was occupied by a band of outlaws,
who had declared war against a world that had
discarded them, and lived by committing
depredations
on the property of every nation without
distinction. In a word, Catharine found herself
a prisoner among a band of the most daring
pirates
that ever infested the ocean;who, within
thirty miles of New-Orleans, were in the habit of
capturing vessels, bound to and from that port,
and murdering every person on board, to prevent
a discovery.
Disagreeable as this information was to
Catharine
,
it was not so dreadful as her
compassionate
attendants had apprehended. She was out of
the power of Sandford, and every other situation
was comparatively happy. Besides, should her
health be restored, she did not despair of
prevailing
on the chief to send her to New-Orleans,
as he was represented to her as a paragon of
generosity and magnanimitya second Charles
de Moor.
Catharine's health gradually returned, and
she had so far recovered her strength as to be
able to walk, when she was one day honored with
a visit from Monsieur La Fitte himself; who,
after politely congratulating her on the partial
restoration of her health, begged her to inform
him in what manner he could serve her.
By conveying, or sending me to
New-Orleans
,
was Catharine's reply.
Were such a step compatible with my own
safety, answered he, I would not hesitate a
moment
.
But, madam, consider what a risk I should
incur by such a step. A price is set upon my
head by the governor of Louisiana, and several
fruitless attempts have already been made to
earn the reward; therefore am I obliged, in
self-defence
,
to destroy instead of preserving my
prisoners. Do your friends reside in
New-Orleans
?
Alas! no, sirthey are far distant. But if
I can once breathe my sorrowful story to a
christian
ear, I shall find protection until I can write to
my friends, who must be wretched at my
mysterious
disappearance.
Mysterious disappearance? said La Fitte;
Although my mode of life, madam, is not such as
can command a christian's confidence, still, if you
will consent to entrust your sorrowful story to my
ear, I pledge you the word of a soldier that you
shall never repent the condescension.
Catharine was willing to conciliate the being
in whose power she had been so providentially
placed, and therefore complied with his request,
and related all the particulars which were
necessary
to make him acquainted with the nature of
her extraordinary and forlorn situation. When
she had finished, La Fitte exclaimed---
Who shall say, then, that we are not the
legal
ministers of Heaven's eternal justice! My
hand slew the scoundrel you describe, and
avenged
the load of wrongs he has heaped upon you.
I now pledge myself that you shall be conveyed
in safety to New-Orleans the first favorable
opportunity
.
In the mean time rest confident of my
protection, and the respectful attentions of all
whom I command. I will now repay your
confidence
by relating some particulars respecting
my own history, and that of our fraternity, with
which the world are little acquainted.
I once held a commission under Bonaparte,
in whose victorious army I was a captain of no
inconsiderable reputation; and, but for one
unfortunate
circumstance, should probably have
arisen to an elevated grade. The circumstance
to which I allude will not interest you, and I shall
therefore pass it over in silence. Let it suffice
that I felt myself injured, and consequently
resigned
my commission and emigrated to America.
I landed in this country with a proud spirit, and
no adequate funds to support my dignity.
Being
an expert swordsman, I opened a fencing
school in New-Orleans, for a livelihood, and
acquired
considerable celebrity in the profession.
During the troubles in St. Domingo, a vast
number of the inhabitants took refuge in Cuba;
and when the late war between France and Spain
commenced, they were compelled to leave that
island, with the short notice of a few days.
Without
ceremony they entered the United States, and
most of them the state of Louisiana, with all the
slaves they had possessed in Cuba. They were
notified by the governor of this state of the clause
in the constitution which forbade the importation
of slaves; but at the same time, received the
assurance
of his excellency that he would obtain, if
possible, the approbation of the general
government
for their retaining this property.
I will not weary your patience with
particulars
.
I was not born for the dull pursuits of
civil
lifemy soul always aspired to lead an army,
but fate had forever blasted my hopes of military
glory. My fellow-beings had treated me with
ingratitude
and indignity, and I now declared war
against the whole despicable race. Sufficient
materials were at hand for the execution of my
scheme. Those very emigrants who had been
hospitably received by the citizens, and highly
favored by the government of their adopted
country
,
repaid this kindness by the blackest
ingratitude
,
which convinced me that they were
sufficiently
base for my purpose. I soon collected a
numerous band, and in 1811, strongly fortified
this island, which is as remarkable for its health
and fertility as for the delicious fish with which its
waters abound. I have continued here ever since,
with a formidable squadron at my command,
which has more than once compelled the United
States flotilla to retreat; I have, also, a large
military
force, and have dealt out large measures of
vengeance against the perfidious race whose
base ingratitude drove me to this extremity. The
strictest subordination exists in the island, both
among my military and naval subjects, who all
fear me for my courage, and love me for the
liberality
with which I relinquish to them my share
of the booty we capture. The prince regent of
53
England cannot boast the same, or he would have
fewer enemies among his own subjects.
About a year ago, the governor of Louisiana
advertised a reward of
five hundred dollars
for
my head, which pitiful offer I immediately
answered
by promising a reward of as many
thousands
for the head of his excellency, and my
advertisements
were posted on every corner in the city of
New-Orleans. A company (commanded by a man
who had once been my intimate friend) was
ordered
out to attack me here on my island, and
was suffered to approach very near before I chose
to make a display of our forces; when, on a
signal
given, he instantly found himself surrounded
by a numerous host of armed men, who
suddenly
emerged from the secret avenues which lead
into this bayou. And in what manner do you
imagine
that I treated this man, who came to destroy
my life and all that makes life desirable to me?
I treated him, madam, as became La Fitte, the
Great Bandit of BarratariaI spared his life
offered him that which would have made the
honest
soldier comfortable for the remainder of his
days, (which was nobly and indignantly refused)
and I then permitted him to return, with his
company
,
in safety to the city.
His excellency was now convinced that we
were too strong to be taken by land, and my navy
has hitherto been larger than that which the
government
has kept on this station.
After again assuring Catharine of his
protection
,
and promising to find her a conveyance
to this city, the generous pirate took his leave.
It was but a few weeks after this conference, that
his boasted army and navy were all captured by
the gallant Patterson and Ross.
And now, my dear mother, adieu for the
present
.
Your lovely daughter-in-law desires to be
remembered with affection, and you may expect
to embrace us all by the first of February.
D. WOODCOCK.
