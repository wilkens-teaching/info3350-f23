In
Europe, dedications have
their price; and the author oftener
looks to the plenitude of the
pockets
,
than the brains of his patron.
The American author can hope
but little pecuniary emolument from
even the
sale
, and not any from the
dedication of his work. To adorn
his book with the name of
some
gentleman, of acknowledged merit,
involves his whole
interest
, in a
public
address
.
With this view, will you, Sir,
permit
a lover of the
Muses
, and a
biographer
of private life, to
address
to
you (a Poet and the Biographer of
a Hero) a detail of
those
miseries
of
slavery
, from which your public
energies
have principally conduced to
liberate hundreds of our fellow
citizens
.

ARGUMENT.
The Author giveth an Account of his gallant
Ancestor
, Captain John Underhill, his
Arrival in
Massachusetts
, and
Perecution
by the
first
Settlers
.
I derive
my birth from one
of the
first
emigrants to New England,
being lineally
descended
from Captain
John Underhill, who came into the
Massachusetts
in the year one
thousand
six
hundred and thirty; of whom honourable
mention is made by that elegant, accurate,
and
interesting
historian
, the Reverend
Jeremy Belknap, in his
History
of New
Hampshire
.
My honoured
ancestor
had early
imbibed
an ardent love of liberty, civil and
religious, by his
service
as a
soldier
among
the Dutch, in their glorious and
successful
struggle
for freedom, with Philip the
second
of Spain; when, though quite a
youth, he held a
commission
in the Earl
of
Leicester
's own troop of guards, who
was then
sent
to the
assistance
of that brave
people, by the renowned Queen
Elizabeth
of England.
The extravagant
passion
, which that
princess
was
supposed
to entertain for
various
male favourites, which
occasioned
the
disgrace
of one, and the
premature
death of another, while it has
furnished
a darling theme to the
novelist
, and
has been wept over in the tragic
scene
,
has never yet received the
sober
sanction
of the
historian
.
A traditional family anecdote, while it
places the affection of the queen for
Leicester
beyond doubt, may not be
unpleasing
to the learned reader, and may
benefit the
English
historiographer
.
It is well known that this crafty queen,
though repeatedly
solicited
, never
efficaciously
assisted
the Netherlanders, until
their affairs were apparently at the
lowest
ebb, and they in
such
desperate
circumstances
,
as to offer the
sovereignty
of their
country to her general, the Earl of
Leicester
. Captain Underhill carried the
dispatches
to England, and delivered them
at the office of Lord Burleigh. The
same
evening, the queen
sent
for the captain,
and, with apparent perturbation, inquired
of him, if he was the
messenger
from
Leicester
, and whether he had any private
dispatches
for her. He replied, that he
had delivered all his letters to the
secretary
of
state
. She appeared much
disappointed
,
and, after
musing
some
time,
said
,
So
Leicester
wants to be a king.
Underhill
,
who was in the general's
confidence
,
replied that the Dutch had indeed
made the offer of the
sovereignty
of their
country to her general
esteeming
it a
great honour, as they
said
, to have a
subject
of her grace for their
sovereign
. No,
replied the queen, it is not the Dutch;
they hate kings and their divine right;
it is the proud
Leicester
, who yearns to
be independent of his own
sovereign
, who
moves this
insolent
proposal
. Tell him,
from me, that he
must
learn to obey,
before
he is
sit
to govern. Tell him, added
the queen,
softening
her voice, that
obedience
may make him a
king indeed
.
Immediately
after Captain Underhill had
taken the public
dispatches
, the queen
sent
for him to her privy
closet
, recalled her
verbal
message
, delivered him a letter for
C 2
Leicester
, directed with her own hand,
and a
purse
of one hundred crowns for
himself
; charging him to
enclose
the
letter
in lead,
sink
it in
case
of danger in his
passage
by
sea
, and to deliver it privately.
On the receipt of this letter,
Leicester
was
violently agitated, walked his chamber the
whole of the
ensuing
night. Soon after, he
resigned
his command, and returned to
England, animated by the
brightest
hopes
of realizing the lofty
suggestions
of his
ambition. With him Captain Underhill
returned, and upon the
decease
of the
Earl of
Leicester
, attached
himself
to the
fortunes of the Earl of
Essex
, the
unfortunate
successour
to
Leicester
in the queen's
favour. He accompanied that gallant
nobleman in his
successful
attack upon
Cadiz, and
shared
his ill fortune in his
fruitless
expedition
against
Tyronne, the
rebel chief of the revolted clans of
Ireland
;
and, returning with the Earl into
England
,
by his attachment to that imprudent
nobleman,
sallying
into the
streets
of
London
in the petty
insurrection
, which
cost
Essex
his head, he was obliged to
seek
safety
in Holland, until the
accession
of
King James, in one
thousand
six
hundred
and three, when he applied for pardon
and leave to return to his native country.
But that monarch entertained
such
an
exalted
idea of the dignity of kings, and
from policy, affected
so
great a veneration
for the memory of his
predecessor
, that
no
interest
of his friends could procure
his pardon for an offence, which, in this
day and country, would be
considered
a
simple
rout or riot, and
punished
with a
small
fine, in that age of kingly glory was
supposed
to combine
treason
and
blasphemy
:
treason
against
the queen in
her political capacity, and
blasphemy
against
her as God's
representative
and
vicegerent on earth.
The Reverend Mr.
Robinson
, with a
number of other pious puritans, having
fled, from the
persecuting
fury of the
English
prelates, to Holland, in one
thousand
six
hundred and three, he dwelt and
communed
with them a number of years. He
was
strongly
solicited
to go with
Governour
Carver, Elder
Brewster
, and the
other
worthies, part of Mr.
Robinson
's
church, to the
settlement
of Plymouth,
and had partly engaged with them, as their
chief military officer; but, Captain Miles
Standish
, his brave fellow
soldier
in the
low countries, undertaking the
business
,
he declined.
How he joined Governour Winthrop,
does not appear, but he came over to New
England with him, and
soon
after we find
him
disciplining
the
Boston
militia, where
he was held in
such
high
estimation
that
he was
chosen
to
represent
that town in
the general court; but, his ideas of
religious
toleration being more liberal than
those
around him, he
lost
his popularity,
and was, on the twentieth of November,
one
thousand
six
hundred and thirty
seven
,
disfranchised
and eventually
banished
the
jurisdiction
of
Massachusetts
.
The writers of
those
times differ, as to
the particular offence for which he was
punished
. Some
say
that it was for
holding
the antinomian tenets of the
celebrated
Ann
Hutchinson
, others that the
charge
against
him was for
saying
,
That
the government at
Boston
were as zealous
as the
scribes
and
pharisees
, and as Paul
before his
conversion
. The
best
account,
I have been able to collect, is, that at the
time when the zeal of our worthy
forefathers
burned the ho
ttest
against
heretics
and
sectaries
, when good Roger Williams,
who
settled
Providence, the pious
Wheelwright
,
and others, were
banished
, he,
with about
sixty
other imprudent
persons
,
who did not believe in the then popular
arguments of fines,
imprisonment
,
disfranchisement
,
confiscation
,
banishments
, and
halters for the
conversion
of infidels,
supposed
that the
christian
faith, which
had
spread
so
wonderfully in its infancy,
when the
sword
of civil power was drawn
against
it, in that age,
surrounded
by
numerous
proselites
, needed not the
same
sword
unsheathed
in its favour.
These
mistaken
people
signed
a
remonstrance
against
the violent proceedings, which were
the order of that day. William
Aspinwall
and John
Coggeshell
, two of the
Boston
representatives
, who
signed
the
remonstrance
,
were
sent
home, and the town
ordered
to
choose
others in their room. Some
of the
remonstrants
recanted,
some
were
fined,
some
were
disfranchised
, and others,
among whom was Captain Underhill,
were
banished
.
It is
said
by
some
authors, that he was
charged with the heinous crime of
adultery
,
and that he even
confessed
it. The
candid American author, above named,
has fallen into this error. As I am
sure
it
must
have given him pain
to
speak
evil
even of the dead
,
so
I am certain he will
rectify this
mistake
in the next edition of
his invaluable
history
.
That author informs us, page forty three
of his
first
volume, That he, Captain
Underhill
,
was privately dealt with, on
suspicion
of adultery, which he
disregarded
, and
therefore on the next
sabbath
was
questioned
for it before the church; but the
evidence not being
sufficient
to convict
him, the church could only
admonish
him.Page forty five, He went to
Boston
, and in the
same
public manner
acknowledged his adultery. But his
confession
was mixed with
so
many
excuses
and extenuations, that it gave no
satisfaction
.
The unwary reader would perhaps
conclude
,
that actual adultery was intended, as
well as
expressed
, in
these
extracts. The
Reverend author
himself
did not advert to
the idea, that the moral law of
Boston
, in
one
thousand
six
hundred and thirty
seven
,
was not
so
lax as the moral law of the
same
place, in one
thousand
seven
hundred
and eighty four, as explained by the
practice
of its inhabitants. The rigid
discipline
of our fathers of that era often
construed
actions,
expressions
, and
sometimes
thoughts, into crimes; which actions
in this day, even the
most
precise
would
consider
either innocent, indifferent, or
beneath the dignity of official notice.
The fact is, that Captain Underhill,
so
far
from CONFESSING, was never charged
with committing actual
statute
book
adultery
.
At a certain lecture in
Boston
,
instead
of noting the referred texts in his
bible, according to the profitable
custom
of the times, this gallant
soldier
had fixed
his eyes
stedfastly
, and perhaps
inordinately
,
upon one
Mistress
Miriam
Wilbore
;
who it
seems
was, at that very time,
herself
in the breach of the
spirit
of an
existing
law, which forbad women to appear
in public with uncovered arms and necks,
by appearing at the
same
lecture with a
pair of wanton open worked gloves,
slit
at
the thumbs and fingers, for the
conveniency
of taking
snuff
; though
she
was
not charged with the latter crime of
using
tobacco. It was the ADULTERY OF
THE HEART, of which my gallant
ancestor
was
accused
, and
sounded
on that text of
scripture
,
Whosoever
looketh on a
woman
to
lust
after her, hath committed
adultery
with her already in his heart.

Hanserd Knollys

Greeting.
Worthee and Beloved
,
Remembrin my kind love to Mr.
Hilton

I now

some
note of my
tryalls at
Boston
.Oh that I may come
out of this, and al the lyke tryalls, as
goold
sevene
times puryfyed in the
furnice
.
After the rulers at
Boston
had fayled
to
fastenne
what Roger Harlakenden was
pleased
to call the damning errours of
Anne
Hutchinson
upon me, I looked to
be
sent
away in peace; but Governour
Winthrop
sayd
I
must
abide the
examining
of ye church; accordingly, on the
thyrd day of ye weeke, I was convened
before
them.Sir Harry Vane, the
governour
,
Dudley, Haines, with
masters
Cotton
,
Shepherd, and Hugh Peters
present
,
with others.They prepounded that I
was to be examined, touching a certain act
of adultery I had committed, with one
mistress
Miriam Wilbore, wife of
Samuel
Wilbore, for carnally looking to
luste
after her, at the lecture in
Boston
, when
master
Shepherd expounded.This
mistress
Miriam hath
since
been dealte with,
for coming to that lecture with a pair of
wanton open workt gloves,
slit
at the
thumbs and fingers, for the
purpose
of
taking
snuff
; for, as
master
Cotton
observed
,
for what end
should
those
vaine
opennings
be, but for the intent of taken
filthy
snuff
; and he quoted Gregory
Nazianzen
upon good works.
Master
Peters
said
, that
these
opennings were Satan's
port holes of firy temptatione.
Mistress
Miriam offerd in
excuse
of her vain attire,
that
she
was newle married, and appeared
in her bridall arraye.
Master
Peters
said
,
that marriage was the
ocasion
that the
Devil tooke to
caste
his firy darts, and lay
his pit falls of temptation, to catche frale
flesh
and bloode. She is to be further
dealt with for taken
snuff
. How the
use
of the good creature tobaccoe can be
an offence I cannot
see
.Oh my beloved,
how
these
prowde
pharisees
labour aboute
the minte and cummine. Governour
Winthrop
inquired of mee, if I
confessed
the
D 2
matter. I
said
I
wished
a coppy of there
charge.Sir Harry Vane
said
, there was
no neede of any coppie,
seeing
I knew I
was guiltee. Charges being made out
where there was an uncertantie whether
the
accused
was guiltie or not, and to
lighten the
accused
into the nature of his
cryme, here was no need.
Master
Cotton
said
, did you not look upon
mistress
Wilbore? I
confessed
that I did. He
said
then you are verelie guiltie, brother
Underhill
.
I
said
nay, I did not look at the
woman
lustfully
.
Master
Peters
said
,
why did you not look at
sister
Nowell or
sister
Upham?
I
said
, verelie they are not
desyrable
women, as to temporale graces
.
Then Hugh Peters and al cryed, it is
enough
,
he hath
confessed
, and
passed
to
excommunication. I
sayd
where is the
law by which you condemne me.
Winthrop
said
, there is a committee to draft
laws. Brother Peters are you not on that
committee, I am
sure
you have maide a law
againste
this cryinge
sin
. Hugh Peters
replyed that he had
such
a law in his
minde, but
had not
writtene it downe.
Sir Harry Vane
said
, it is
sufficient
.
Haynes
said
,
ay, law enough for

excuse
me to the candid

relinquished
the delights of
their native country,
crossed

ocean, penetrated a
savage
wilderness

encountered famine,
pestilence

and Indian warfare, and

to us their
sentiments
of independence,
that love of liberty, which under God

Farther
account of his
Ancestors
.
When
the
sentence
of
banishment
passed
on Captain Underhill, he
retired to Dover in New
Hampshire
,
and was elected governour of the
European
settlers
there; but,
notwithstanding
his great
service
to the people of
Massachusetts
,
in the Pequod wars, his
persecutors
in
Boston
would not allow him to
die in peace.
First
, by writing injurious
letters to
those
he governed; by threats
of their power; and
lastly
, by
determining
that Dover was within the
jurisdiction
of
Massachusetts
, they forced him to
slee
to Albany, then
possessed
by the
Dutch, under the name of Amboyna.
The Dutch were highly
pleased
with
the Captain, and after Dutchifying his
name into Captain Hans Van Vanderhill,
they gave him a command of one hundred
and twenty men, in their wars with the
natives. It is
said
that he killed one
hundred and fifty Indians on Long
Island
, and upwards of three hundred on
the Main. The laurels of the famous
Colonel Church wither in
comparison
.
The Dutch granted him fifty
thousand
acres
of land, then in their
possession
.
Although
the
English
, when they took
possession
of that country for the Duke of York,
afterwards James the
second
, had
promised
to quiet the claims of the
settlers
; yet
Captain Underhill, or his
posterity
, have
never availed
themselves
of the grant.
Mentioning this
circumstance
,
sometime
since
in Hartford,
some
gentlemen
immediately
offered to
raise
a company and
purchase
my right. I candidly
confessed
that I was not
possessed
of the title,
and knew not the particular
spot
where
the land lay, and
consequently
was
unwilling
to
sell
land without title or
boundaries
.
To my
surprise
they laughed at my
scruples
, and
observed
that they wanted
the land to
speculate
upon, to
sell
, and
not to
settle
. Titles and boundaries, in
such
cases
, I
understood
, were indifferent
matters, mere trifles.
My brave
ancestor
at an advanced age,
died in Albany, leaving two
sons
; the
youngest
of whom removed to the
mouth of
Hudson
, where
some
of his
posterity
flourish
respectably
to this day.
The
eldest
son
, Benoni, from whom I am
descended
,
some
years after his father's
decease
, after being the
subject
of various
misfortunes, returned in
impoverished
circumstances
to New
Hampshire
, where
the family have continued ever
since
.

ARGUMENT.
The Author's Birth, and a remarkable Dream
of his Mother:
Observations
on
foreboding
Dreams: The Author reciteth a
Dream of Sir William Phipps,
Governour
of
Massacbusetts
, and
resereth
small
Infidels to Mather's Magnalia
.
I was
born on the
sixteenth
of
July, Anno Domini, one
thousand
seven
hundred and
sixty
two. My mother,
some
months before my birth, dreamed that
she
was delivered of me; that I was lying
in the cradle, that the
house
was
beset
by
Indians, who broke into the next room,
and took me into the fields with them;
that, alarmed by their hideous yellings and
warhoops,
she
ran to the window, and
saw
a number of young tawny
savages
,
playing at foot ball with my head; while
several
sachems
and
sagamores
were
looking
on unconcerned.
This dream made a deep
impression
on
my mother. I well recollect, when a
boy, her
stroking
my flaxen locks,
repeating
her dream, and
observing
with a
sigh
to my father, that
she
was
sure
Updike
was born to be the
sport
of fortune, and
that he would one day
suffer
among
savages
.
Dear woman,
she
had the native
Indians in her mind, but never
apprehended
her poor
son
's
suffering
, many
years as a
slave
, among barbarians,
more cruel than the
monsters
of our own
woods.
The learned reader will
smile
contemptuously
,
perhaps, upon my
mentioning
dreams, in this enlightened age. I
only
relate facts, and leave the reader to his
own comments. My own opinion of
dreams I
shall
conceal, perhaps
because
I
am
ashamed
to
disclose
it. I will venture
to
observe
that, if we
inspect
the
sacred
scriptures
, we
shall
find frequent
instances
, both of direction to duty, and
forewarning of future events,
communicated
by Providence, through the
intervention
of dreams. Is not the modern
christian
equally the care of indulgent
Heaven, as the favoured Jew, or the
beloved
patriarch?
Many modern examples, of the
foreboding
visions
of the night, may be
adduced
.
William Phipps, a poor journeyman
ship
carpenter, dreamed that he
should
one day ride in his coach, and live in a
grand
house
near
Boston
common. Many
years afterwards, when he was knighted
by King William the third, and came from
England, governour of
Massachusetts
Bay,
this dream, even as to the
situation
of the
grand
house
, was literally and minutely
fulfilled. If the
insect
infidels of the day
doubt this fact, let them
consult
, for their
edification, the learned Doctor
Mather's
Magnalia, where the whole
story
, at
large,
is
minutely and amply related.
It
was the errour of the times of
monkish
ignorance
,
to believe every thing. It may
possibly
be the errour of the
present
day, to credit
nothing
.

ARGUMENT.
The Author is placed at a private School:
Parental Motives to a College Education:
Their
design
frustrated
by family
Mifortune
.
In
my childhood I was
sent
, as
is
customary
, to a woman's
school
, in the
summer
, and to a man's, in the winter
season
, and made great
progress
in
such
learning as my preceptors dealt in.
About
my twelfth year, our
minister
, who
made it his
custom
to
inspect
the
schools
annually, came to our
district
. My
master
,
who looked upon me as his
best
scholar
,
directed me to read a
lesson
in
Dilworth's
spelling
book, which I recited as
loud as I could
speak
, without regard to
emphasis
or
stops
. This
so
pleased
our
minister
, who prided
himself
on the
strength
of his own lungs, that, a
short
time after,
coming to my father's, to
dicker
, as they
stiled
it, about a
swop
of cattle, and not
finding my father
sharp
at the bargain,
he changed the
discourse
upon me;
observing
how delighted he was with my
performances at
school
. What a pity it
was
such
a genius was not encouraged.
Mr. Underhill, you
must
put Updike to
learning. My father pleaded poverty.
When I went to Harvard College, replied
the
minister
, I was poor indeed. I had
no father with a good farm to
assist
me;
but, with being butler's
freshman
, and
ringing the bell the
first
year, waiter the
three
last
, and keeping
school
in the
vacations
,
I rubbed through, and am now
what I am; and who knows, continued
he, but when Updike has completed his
education, he may make a
minister
, and
possibly
, when my
usefulness
is over,
supply
our very pulpit.
My mother here interfered. She was
a little
spare
woman. My father was a
large bony man; famous, in his youth,
for carrying the ring at
wrestling
; and,
in his latter years, for his
preseverance
at
town meetings. But,
notwithstanding
my
father's
success
in carrying points abroad,
my mother,
some
how or other, contrived
always to carry them at home. My father
never would acknowledge this; but, when
a
coarse
neighbour would
sometimes
slily
hint the old adage of the gray mare
being the better
horse
, he would
say
to
his particular friends that he always was
conqueror in his
domestic
warfare: but
would
confess
that he loved quiet, and
was of late tired of perpetually getting the
victory. My mother joined the
minister
;
observing
that Updike
should
have
learning, though
she
worked her hands to
the bone to procure it. She did not doubt,
when he came to preach, he would be as
much run after as the great Mr.
Whitfield
.
I always thought, continued
she
,
the child was a genius; and always
intended
he
should
go to college. The boy
loves books. He has read Valentine and
Orson
, and
Robinson
Crusoe
. I went,
the other day, three miles to borrow
Pilgrim's
Progress
for him. He has read it
through every bit; ay, and
understands
it too. Why, he
stuck
a
skewer
through
Apollyon's eye in the picture, to help
Christian
beat him. My father could
not
answer
my mother's argument. The
dicker about the oxen was renewed; and
it was concluded to
swop
even, though my
father's were much the likelier cattle, and
that I
should
go that week and
study
Latin
with the
minister
, and be fitted for college.
With him I
studied
four years,
labouring
incessantly
at Greek and Latin:
as to
English
grammar, my preceptor,
knowing nothing of it
himself
, could
communicate
nothing to me. As he was
enthusiastically
attached to the Greek, and
had delivered an oration in that language,
at the commencement at Cambridge, when
he took his
first
degree, by his direction,
I committed to memory above four
hundred
of the
most
sonorous
lines in
Homer
,
which I was called to repeat before
a number of clergymen, who
visited
him
at an annual convention, in our
parish
.
These
gentlemen were ever
pleased
to
express
astonishing
admiration at my
literary
acquirements. One of them
prognosticated
that I
should
be a general, from
the fire and force, with which I recited
Homer's battles of the Greeks and
Trojans
.
Another augered that I
should
be a
member of
congress
, and equal the
Adamses
in oratory, from my repeating the
speeches
,
at the councils of the heathen gods,
with
such
attention to the c
sura
. A
third was
sure
that I
should
become a
Witherspoon
in divinity, from the pathos,
with which I declaimed Jupiter's
speech
to all the gods. In fine,
these
gentlemen
considered
the
classics
the
source
of all valuable knowledge. With them
dead languages were more
estimable
than
living; and nothing more
necessary
to
accomplish
a young man for all, that is
profitable and honourable in life, than a
profound knowledge of Homer. One of
them gravely
observed
that he was
sure
General
Washington
read Greek; and
that he never would have captured the
Hessians
at Trenton, if he had not taken
his plan of operation from that of
Ulysses
and Diomede
seizing
the
horses
of
Rhesus
,
as
described
in the tenth book of the Iliad.
Thus flattered by the learned, that I
was in the high road to fame, I gulped
down daily portions of Greek, while my
preceptor made quarterly
visits
to my
father's
barn yard, for pay for my
instruction
.
In June, one
thousand
seven
hundred
and eighty, my father began
seriously
to think of
sending
me to college.
He called upon a neighbour, to whom he
had
sold
part of his farm, for
some
cash
.
His creditor readily paid, the whole
sum
due, down in paper money, and my father
found, to his
surprize
, that the value of
three acres paid him the principal and
interest
of the whole
sum
, for which he had
sold
seventy
five acres of land, five years
before. This was
so
severe
a
stroke
of ill
fortune, that it entirely
frustrated
the
design
of
sending
me to college.

ARGUMENT.
This Chapter containeth an Eulogy on the
Greek Tongue
.
What
added to the
misfortune
,
mentionedin the
last
chapter, aworthy
divine,
settled
in
Boston
,
passing
through
our town, told my father, ina private
conversation
,
that all the Greek I had
acquired
,
was of no other
service
than fitting me
for college. My father was
astonished
.
He was a plain unlettered man, of
strong
natural abilities. Pray, Reverend Sir,
said
my father, do they not learn this
Greek language at college? If
so
, why do
such
wise
men, as the governours of
colleges
,
teach boys what is entirely
useless
?
F
I thought that the
sum
of all good
education
was, to teach youth
those
things,
which they were to
practise
in after life.
Learning, replied our enlightened
visitor
,
has its
fashions
; and, like other
fashions
of this world, they
pass
away. When our
forefathers founded the college, at
Cambridge
,
critical knowledge in the mazes
and
subtleties
of
school
divinity was all
the mode. He that could give a new
turn to an old text, or detect a
mistranslation
in the
version
, was more admired
than the man, who invented printing,
discovered
the magnetic powers, or
contrived
an
instrument
of agriculture, which
should
abridge the labour of the
husbandman
.
The books of our faith, with the
voluminous commentaries of the fathers,
being originally written, in what are now
called, the dead languages, the knowledge
of
those
languages was then
necessary
, for
the
accomplishment
of the
fashionable
scholar
. The moderns, of New England,
have
ceased
to
interest
themselves
in the
disputes
, whether a civil oath may be
administered
to an unregenerate man; or,
whether
souls
,
existing
merely in the
contemplation
of Deity, are capable of actual
transgression
.
Fashion
has given a new
direction to the
pursuits
of the learned.
They no longer
soar
into the regions of
infinite
space
; but endeavour, by the aid
of natural and moral
philosophy
, to
amend
the manners, and better the
condition
of man: and the college, at
Cambridge
,
may be
assimilated
to an old beau,
with his pocket holes under his arm pits,
the
skirts
of his coat to his ancles, and
three
gross
of buttons on his breeches;
looking with contempt on the more
easy
,
useful
garb of the
present
day, for
deviating
from what was
fashionable
in his
youth.
But, inquired my father, is there not
some
valuable knowledge contained in
those
Greek books? All that is
useful
in
them, replied our
visitor
, is already
translated
into
English
; and more of the
sense
and
spirit
may be imbibed, from
translations
,
than
most
scholars
would be
able
to extract, from the originals, if they
even availed
themselves
of
such
an
acquaintance
with that language, as is
usually
acquired, at college.
Well
, replied my father, do you call
them dead languages. It appears to me
now, that confining a lad of lively genius
to the
study
of them, for five or
six
of the
most
precious years of his youth, is like
the ingenious cruelty of
those
tyrants, I
have heard of, who chained the living
and the dead together. If Updike went
to college, I
should
wish
he would learn,
not
bard wards
, but
useful
things
.
You
spake
of governours of
colleges
,
continued our
visitor
. Let me
observe
,
as an apology, for the concern they
may be
supposed
to have, in this
errour
,
that they are moral, worthy men,
who have
passed
the
same
dull routine of
education, and
whose
knowledge is
necessarily
confined to
these
defunct languages.
They
must
teach their pupils what they
know, not what they do not know. That
measure
, which was
measured
unto them,
they mete out,
most
liberally, unto others.
Should not the
legislature
, as the fathers
of the people, interfere, inquired my
father
?
We will not talk politics, at this
time, replied our
visitor
.
My father was now determined that I
should
not go to college. He concealed
this
conversation
from me, and I was left
to be proud of my Greek. The little
advantage
,
this
deceased
language has
since
been to me, has often
caused
me
sorely
to
regret the
mispense
of time, in acquiring
it. The French make it no part of their
academical
studies
. Voltaire,
D'Alembert
,
and Diderot, when they completed
their education, were probably ignorant
of the
cognata tempora
of a Greek verb.
F 2
It was
resolved
that I
should
labour on
my father's farm; but alas! a
taste
for
Greek had quite eradicated a love for
labour
.
Poring
so
intensely
on Homer
and Virgil had
so
completely filled my
brain with the heathen mythology, that I
imagined a Hamadryade in every
sapling
,
a Naiad in every puddle; and expected
to hear the
sobbings
of the infant Fauns,
as I turned the furrow. I gave Greek
names to all our farming tools; and
cheered
the cattle with hexameter
verse
. My
father's hired men, after a tedious day's
labour in the woods,
inspecting
our
stores
,
for
refreshment
,
instead
of the
customary
bread and
cheese
and brandy, found
Homer's
Iliad, Virgil Delphini and
Schrevelius's
Lexicon, in the
basket
.
After I had worked on the farm
some
months, having killed a fat heifer of my
father's, upon which the family
depended
for their winter's beef, covered it with
green boughs, and laid it in the
shade
to
putrify, in order to
raise
a
swarm
of bees,
after the manner of Virgil; which
process
,
notwithstanding
I followed
closely
the
directions
in the georgics,
some
how or
other, failed, my father
consented
to my
mother's
request
, that I
should
renew my
career of learning.

ARGUMENT.
The Author keepeth a country School: The
Anticipations,
Pleasures
and Profits of a
Pedagogue
.
By
our
minister
's
recommendation
,
I was engaged to keep a
school
, in
a neighbouring town,
so
soon
as our fall's
work was over.
How my heart dilated with the
prospect
,
in the tedious interval, previous to
my entering upon my
school
. How
often
have I
stood
suspended
over my dung
fork, and anticipated my
scholars
,
seated
in awful
silence
around me, my arm chair
and birchen
sceptre
of authority. There
was an echo in my father's
sheep
pasture
.
More than once have I repaired there
alone
,
and exclaimed with a loud voice,
is MASTER Updike Underhill at home?
I would
speak
with MASTER
Underhill
,
for the
pleasure
of hearing how my
title
sounded
.
Dost
thou
smile
,
indignant
reader,
pause
and recollect if
these
sensations
have not been familiar to thee,
at
sometime
in thy life. If thou
answerest
disdainfully
nothen I aver thou
hast
never been a corporal in the militia,
or a
sophimore
at college.
At times, I however entertained
less
pleasing
, but more rational contemplations
on my
prospects
. As I had been once
unmercifully whipt, for detecting my
master
in a
false
concord, I
resolved
to be mild
in my government, to avoid all manual
correction
,
and doubted not by
these
means to
secure
the love and
respect
of my pupils.
In the interim of
school
hours, and in
those
peaceful intervals, when my pupils
were engaged in
study
, I hoped to indulge
myself
with my favourite Greek. I
expected
to be overwhelmed with the
gratitude
of their parents, for pouring the
fresh
instruction
over the minds of their
children, and teaching their young ideas
how to
shoot
. I anticipated
independence
from my
salary
, which was to be
equal
to four dollars, hard money, per
month, and my boarding; and expected
to find
amusement
and
pleasure
among the
circles of the young, and to derive
information
and delight from the
classic
converse
of the
minister
.
In due time my ambition was gratified,
and I placed at the head of a
school
,
consisting
of about
sixty
scholars
. Excepting
three or four overgrown boys of eighteen,
the generality of them were under the
age of
seven
years. Perhaps a more
ragged
,
ill bred, ignorant
set
, never were
collected
,
for the
punishment
of a poor
pedagogue
.
To
study
in
school
was
impossible
.
Instead
of the
silence
I anticipated,
there was an
incessant
clamour.
Predominant
among the jarring
sounds
were,
Sir, may I read? May I
spell
?
Master
,
may I go out? Will
master
mend my
pen? What with the pouting of the
small
children,
sent
to
school
, not to learn, but
to keep them out of harm's way, and
the gruff
surly
complaints of the larger
ones, I was nearly
distracted
. Homer's
poluphlososio
thalasses
, roaring
sea
, was a
whisper
to it. My
resolution
, to avoid
beating of them, made me invent
small
punishments
, which often have a
salutary
impression
, on delicate minds; but they
were
insensible
to
shame
. The putting of
a paper fool's cap on one, and ordering
another
under my great chair, only excited
mirth in the
school
; which the very
delinquents
themselves
often
increased
, by
loud peals of laughter. Going, one
frosty
morning, into my
school
, I found one
of the larger boys
sitting
by the fire in my
arm chair. I gently
requested
him to
remove
.
He replied that he would, when
he had warmed
himself
; father finds
wood, and not you. To have my throne
usurped
, in the face of the whole
school
,
shook
my government to the centre. I
immediately
snatched
my two foot rule,
and laid it pretty
smartly
across
his back.
He quitted the chair, muttering that he
would tell father. I found his threats of
more
consequence
than I apprehended.
The
same
afternoon, a tall, rawboned man
called me to the door; immediately
collering
me with one hand, and holding a
cart whip over my head with the other;
with fury in his face, he vowed he would
whip the
skin
from my bones, if ever I
struck
Jotham again: ay, he would do it
that very moment, if he was not afraid I
would take the law of him. This was the
only
instance
of the overwhelming
gratitude
of parents I received. The next day,
it was reported all over town, what a cruel
man the
master
was. Poor Jotham came
into
school
, half frozen and near fainting;
master
had been
sitting
a whole hour by
the warm fire; he only begged him to let
him warm
himself
a little, when the
master
rose
in a rage, and cut open his head with
the tongs, and his life was
despaired
of.
Fatigued with the vexations of my
school
, I one evening repaired to the
tavern
,
and mixed with
some
of the young
men of the town. Their
conversation
I
could not
relish
; mine they could not
comprehend. The
subject
of race
horses
being introduced, I ventured to
descant
upon Xanthus, the immortal
courser
of
Achilles. They had never heard of '
squire
Achilles, or his
horse
; but they offered to
bet two to one, that Bajazet, the Old
Roan, or the deacon's mare, Pumpkin
and Milk, would beat him, and challenged
me to appoint time and place.
G
Nor was I more acceptable among the
young women. Being invited to
spend
an evening, after a quilting, I thought
this a happy opportunity to introduce
Andromache, the wife of the great
Hector
,
at her loom; and Penelope, the
faithful
wife of
Ulysses
, weaving her
seven
years
web. This was received with a
stupid
stare
, until I mentioned the long time the
queen of
Ulysses
was weaving; when a
smart
young woman
observed
, that
she
supposed
Miss
Penelope's yarn was rotted
in whitening, that made her
so
long:
and then told a tedious
story
of a piece of
cotton and linen
she
had
herself
woven,
under the
same
circumstances
. She
had no
sooner
finished
, than, to enforce
my
observations
, I recited above forty
lines of Greek, from the
Odessey
, and
then began a
dissertation
on the
cura
.
In the
midst
of my harrangue, a
florid faced young man, at the further
end of the room, with two large
prominent
foreteeth, remarkably white, began
to
sing
,
Fire upon the mountains, run boys, run;
And immediately the whole company
rushed
forward, to
see
who
should
get a
chance in the reel of
six
.
I was about retiring, fatigued and
disgusted
,
when it was hinted to me, that I
might wait on
Miss
Mima home; but as I
could recollect no word in the Greek, which
would
construe
into
bundling
, or any of
Homer's heroes, who
got the bag
, I
declined
.
In the Latin, it is true, that
neas
and Dido, in the cave,
seem
something
like a precedent. It was reported all over
the town, the next day, that
master
was a
papish
, as he had talked French two hours.
Disappointed
of recreation, among the
young, my next object was the
minister
.
Here I expected
pleasure
and profit. He
had
spent
many years in preaching, for
the edification of private families, and
was
settled
in the town, in a fit of
enthusiasm
;
when the people drove away a
clergyman,
respectable
for his years and
learning. This he was
pleased
to call an
awakening. He lectured me, at the
first
onset
, for not attending the conference
and night meetings; talked much of gifts,
and decried human learning, as carnal and
devilish
, and well he might, he certainly
was under no obligations to it; for a new
singing
master
coming into town, the
young people, by their
master
's advice,
were for introducing Dr. Watts's
version
of the
Psalms
. Although I argued with
the
minister
an hour, he remains firmly
convinced, to this day, that the
version
of
Sternhold and Hopkins is the
same
in
language, letter, and metre, with
those
Psalms
King David chaunted, in the city
of
Jerusalem
.
As for the independence I had
founded
,
on my wages, it
vanished
, like the
rest
of my
scholastic
prospects
. I had
contracted
some
debts. My
request
for
present
payment, was received with
astonishment
.
I found, I was not to
expect it, until the next autumn, and
then not in
cash
, but produce; to
become
my own collector, and pick up my
dues, half a peck of corn or rye in a
place.
I was
almost
distracted
, and yearned
for the expiration of my contract, when
an unexpected period was put to my
distress
.
News was brought, that, by the
carelessness
of the boys, the
school
house
was burnt down. The common cry now
was, that I ought, in
justice
, to pay for it;
as to my want of proper government the
carelessness
of the boys ought to be
imputed
.
The beating of Jotham, was
forgotten
,
and a
thousand
stories
of my want
of proper
spirit
circulated.
These
reports,
and even the
loss
of a valuable
Gradus
ad
Parnassum
, did not damp my joy. I
am
sometimes
led to believe, that my
emancipation
from real
slavery
in Algiers,
G 2
did not afford me
sincerer
joy, than I
experienced
at that moment.
I returned to my father, who received
me with
kindness
. My mother heard
the
story
of my
discomfitures
with
transport
;
as,
she
said
,
she
had no doubt that
her dream, about my falling into the
hands of
savages
, was now out.

ARGUMENT.
A
sure
Mode of
discovering
the Bent of a
young Man's Genius
.
I abode
at home the
remainder
of the winter. It was determined
that I
should
pursue
one of the learned
professions
. My father, with parental
pride and partiality, conceiving my
aversion
to labour, my inattention to farming
business
, and the tricks I had played him,
the preceding
season
, as the
sure
indications
of genius. He now told the
story
of the putrified heifer, with triumph; as
he had read, in the news papers, that
playing
with paper kites was the foundation
of Doctor Franklin's fame; that John
Locke, who
dissected
the human mind,
and
discovered
the circulation of the
soul
,
had, in the full
exercise
of his
understanding
,
played at duck and drake, on the
Thames, with his gold watch, while he
gravely returned the pebble
stone
, which
he held in his other hand, into his fob;
and, that the learned Sir
Isaac
Newton
made
soap
bladders with the funk of a
tobacco
pipe, and was, ever after,
so
enamoured
with his
sooty
junk, as to make
use
of the delicate finger of a young lady,
he courted, as a pipe
stopper
.
I was allowed the choice of my
profession
,
to
discover
the bent of my genius.
By the advice of a friend, my father put
into my hands, what he was told were
some
of the prime books, in the feveral
sciences
. In divinity, I read ten
funeral
,
five election, three ordination, and
seventeen
farewell

ARGUMENT.
The Author commences the Study of
Physic
,
with a celebrated
Physician
and
Occulist
:
A
Philosophical
Detail of the
Operation
of couching for the Gutta Serena,
by his Preceptor, upon a young Man,
born Blind
.
The
next
spring
, I entered
upon my
studies
, with a
physician
, not
more
justly
celebrated for his knowledge
of the materia medica, than for his
peculiar
dexterity and
success
, in couching for
the gutta
serena
, and
restoring
persons
,
even born blind, to
sight
. The account
of a cure he performed, after I had been
with him about a year, may not be
unacceptable
to the lovers of natural
research
.
The
subject
was a young man, of twenty
two years of age, of a
sweet
disposition
,
amiable manners, and oppulent
connexions
.
He was born
stone
blind. His
blindness
was in
some
measure
compensated
,
by the attention of his friends;
and the
encreased
power of his other
organs
of perception. His brothers and
sisters
enriched his mind, by reading to
him, in
succession
, two hours every day,
from the
best
authors. His
sense
of
feeling
was
astonishingly
delicate, and his
hearing, if
possible
, more acute. His
senses
of
taste
and
smelling
, were not
so
remarkable. After the
customary
salutation
,
of
shaking
hands, with a
stranger
,
he would know a
person
, by the touch of
the
same
hand,
several
years after, though
absent
in the interim. He could read a
book or news paper, newly printed,
tolerably
well, by tracing, with the tip of his
finger, the indents of the types. He
acquired
a knowledge of the letters of the
alphabet early, from the prominent
letters
on the gingerbread alphabets of the
baker. He was
master
of
music
, and had
contrived a board, perforated with many
gimblet holes; and, with the
assistance
of a
little bag of wooden pegs,
shaped
at top,
according to his directions, he could prick
almost
any tune, upon its being
sung
to
him. When in a large company, who
sat
silent
, he could
distinguish
how many
persons
were
present
, by noting, with his
ear, their different manner of breathing.
By the rarity or
density
of the air, not
perceivable by
those
in company, he
could
distinguish
high ground from low;
and by the motion of the
summer
's
breeze, too
small
to move the
loftiest
leaf,
he would pronounce, whether he was in
a wood or open country.
He was an unfeigned believer, in the
salutary
truths of
christianity
. He had
imbibed
its benevolent
spirit
. When he
spoke
of religion, his language was love to God,
and good will to man. He was no
zealot
,
but, when he talked of the wonders of
creation, he was animated with a glow of
enthusiasm
. You
observed
, the other
day, as we were walking on this plain,
my friend,
addressing
himself
to me, as I
was intimate in the family, that you knew
a certain
person
, by his gait, when at
so
great a
distance
, that you could not
discern
his features. From this you took
occasion
to
observe
, that you
saw
the
master
hand of the great Creator, in the obvious
difference that was between man and man:
not only the
grosser
difference between
the Indian, the African, the
Esquimeaux
,
and the white man; but that which
distinguishes
and defines accurately, men of
the
same
nation, and even children of
the
same
parents. You
observed
, that as
all the children of the great family of
the earth, were compounded of
similar
members, features, and lineaments, how
wonderfully it
displayed
the
skill
of the
H
Almighty
Artist
, to model
such
an infinite
variety of beings, and
distinctly
diversify
them, from the
same
materials. You
added, that the incident, you had noticed,
gave
fresh
instance
of admiration; for you
was now convinced that, if even all men
had been formed of
so
near
resemblance
,
as not to be
discerned
from each other,
when at
rest
; yet, when in motion, from
their gait, air, and manner, they might
readily be
distinguished
. While you
spoke
, I could perceive, that you pitied
me, as being blind to a wonderful
operation
of creative power. I too, in my turn,
could triumph. Blind as I am, I have
discovered
a
still
minuter, but as certain a
distinction
, between the children of men,
which has
escaped
the touch of your eyes.
Bring me five men, perfect
strangers
to
me; pair the nails of the
same
finger,
so
as to be even with the fingers ends, let me
touch, with the tip of my finger, the nails
thus prepared. Tell me each
person
's
name, as he
passes
in contact before me,
bring the
same
persons
to me one month
afterwards, with their nails paired, in the
same
manner, and I will call every one by
his right name. For, be
assured
, my friend,
that
artist
, who has denied to me that
thing called light, hath opened the eyes
of my mind, to know that there is not a
greater difference between the African
and the European, than what I could
discover
,
between the finger nails of all the
men of this world. This experiment he
afterwards tried, with uniform
success
.
It was
amusing
, in a gayer hour, to hear
him argue the
superiority
of the touch to
the
sight
. Certainly, the feeling is a
nobler
sense
, than that you call
sight
. I
infer
it from the care nature has taken of the
former, and her
disregard
to the latter.
The eyes are comparatively poor, puny,
weak organs. A
small
blow, a mote, or a
straw
may reduce
those
, who
see
with them,
to a
situation
as pitiable as mine; while
feeling is
diffused
over the whole body.
Cut off my arm, and a
sense
of feeling
remains
.
Completely
dismember
me, and,
while I live, I
possess
it. It is
coexistent
with life
itself
.
The
senses
of
smelling
and
taste
are but
modifications of this noble
sense
,
distinguished
,
through the inaccuracy of men,
by other names. The flavour of the
most
delicious
morsel
is felt by the tongue;
and, when we
smell
the aromatic, it is the
effluvia of the
rose
, which comes in contact
with the olfactory nerves. You, that
enjoy
sight
, inadvertently
confess
its
inferiority
.
My brother, honing his penknife,
the other day,
passed
it over his thumb
nail, to
discover
if the edge was
smooth
.
I heard him, and inquired, why he did
not touch it with his eyes, as he did other
objects. He
confessed
that he could not
discover
the gaps, by the
sight
. Here, the
superiority
of the
most
inaccurate
seat
of
the feeling, was
manifest
. To conclude,
he would archly add: in marriage, the
most
important concern in life, how many
miserable
, of both
sexes
, are left to deplore,
in tears, their dependence on this
treacherous
thing, called
sight
. From this
danger
,
I am happily
secured
, continued he,
smiling
and
pressing
the hand of his
cousin
,
who
sat
beside
him; a beautiful
blooming young woman, of eighteen,
who had been bred with him, from
childhood
,
and
whose
affection for him, was
such
that
she
was willing,
notwithstanding
his
blindness
, to take him as a partner for
life. They expected
shortly
to be married.
Notwithstanding
his accuracy and
veracity
upon
subjects
, he could comprehend;
there were many, on which he was
miserably
confused
. He called
sight
the touch
of the eyes. He had no adequate idea of
colours. White, he
supposed
, was like the
feeling of down; and
scarlet
he
resembled
to the
sound
of martial
music
. By
passing
his hands over the porcelain, earthern, or
H 2
plaister
of Paris images, he could readily
conceive of their being
representations
of
men or animals. But he could have no
idea of pictures. I
presented
him a large
picture of his grand father, painted with
oil colours on
canvass
; told him
whose
resemblance
it was. He
passed
his hand
over the
smooth
surface
and
mused
. He
repeated this; exclaimed it was
wonderful
;
looked melancholy; but never
asked
for the picture again.
Upon this young man, my preceptor
operated
successfully
. I was
present
during the whole
process
, though few
were admitted. Upon the introduction
of the couching
instruments
, and the
removal
of the film from the retina, he
appeared
confused
. When the operation was
completed, and he was permitted to look
around
him, he was violently agitated. The
irritability of the ophthalmic
muscles
faintly
,
expressed
the perturbation of his mind.
After two and twenty years of total
darkness
,
to be thus awakened to a new world
of
sensation
and light; to have
such
a flood
of day poured on his benighted eye ball,
overwhelmed him. The infant
sight
was
too weak, for the
shock
, and he fainted.
The doctor immediately intercepted the
light with the proper bandages, and, by
the application of volatiles, he was
revived
.
The next day, the
dressings
were
removed. He had fortified his mind,
and was more calm. At
first
, he
appeared
to have
lost
more than he had gained,
by being
restored
to
vision
. When blind,
he could walk tolerably well, in places
familiar to him. From
sight
, he collected
no ideas of
distance
. Green was a colour
peculiarly agreeable to the new born
sight
.
Being led to the window, he was
charmed
with a tree in full verdure, and extended
his arms to touch it, though at ten rods
distance
.
To
distinguish
objects within reach,
he would
close
his eyes, feel of them with his
hands, and then look
earnestly
upon them.
According to a preconcerted plan, the
third day, his bandages were removed, in
the
presence
of his parents, brothers,
sisters
, friends, and of the amiable, lovely
girl, to whom he was
shortly
to be
married
.
By his
request
, a profound
silence
was to be
observed
, while he
endeavoured
to
discover
the
person
of her, who was
the object of his
dearest
affection. It
was an
interesting
scene
. The company
obeyed his injunction. Not a finger
moved
,
or a breath
aspirated
. The bandage
was then removed; and, when he had
recovered
from the
confusion
of the
instant
effusion
of light, he
passed
his eye
hastily
over the whole group. His
sensations
were novel and
interesting
. It
was a moment of importance. For aught
he knew, he might find the
bosom
partner
of his future life, the twin
soul
of his affection, in the fat
scullion
wench, of his father's kitchen; or in the
person
of the
toothless
,
palsied
, decriped
nurse
, who held the
bason
of gruel at his
elbow.
In
passing
his eye a
second
time over
the circle, his attention was
arrested
, by his
beloved
cousin
. The agitations of her
lovely
features, and the
evanescent
blush
on
her cheek, would have at once betrayed
her, to a more experienced eye. He
passed
his eye to the next
person
, and
immediately
returned it to her. It was a
moment
big with expectation. Many a finger
was
raised
to the lips of the
spectators
,
and many a look,
expressive
of the
silence
she
should
preserve
, was
cast
towards her.
But the conflict was too violent for her
delicate frame. He looked more
intensely
;
she
burst
into tears, and
spoke
. At
the well known voice he
closed
his eyes,
rushed
towards her, and
clasped
her in
his arms. I envied them their feelings;
but I thought then, and do now, that the
sensations
of my preceptor, the
skilful
humane
operator, were more enviable. The
man who could
restore
life and
usefulness
,
to the darling of his friends, and
scatter
light in the paths of an amiable young
pair,
must
have known a joy never
surpassed
;
except, with reverence be it
spoken
,
by the
satisfaction
of our benevolent
Saviour
,
when, by his miraculous power, he
opened the eyes of the actually blind,
made the dumb to
sing
, and the lame and
impotent leap for joy.

ARGUMENT.
Anecdotes of the celebrated Doctor Moyes
.
Mentioning
the
subject
of the
last
chapter, to the celebrated
Doctor
Moyes, who, though blind, delivered
a lecture upon optics, and delineated the
properties of light and
shade
, to the
Bostonians
,
in the year one
thousand
seven
hundred
and eighty five; he exhibited a more
astonishing
illustration
of the power of the
touch. A highly
polished
plane of
steel
was
presented
to him, with a
stroke
of an
etching tool,
so
minutely engraved upon
it, that it was
invisible
to the naked eye,
and only
discoverable
with a powerful
magnifying
glass
; with his fingers he
discovered
the extent, and
measured
the
length of the line.
This gentleman
lost
his
sight
, at three
years of age. He informed me, that
being
overturned, in a
stage
coach, one dark
rainy evening, in England, when the
carriage, and four
horses
, were thrown
into
a ditch, the
passengers
and driver, with
two eyes a piece, were obliged to apply
to him, who had none, for
assistance
, in
extricating the
horses
. As for me,
said
he, after I had recovered from the
astonishment
of the fall, and
discovered
that I
had
escaped
unhurt, I was quite at home
in the dark ditch. The
inversion
of the
order of things was
amusing
. I, that was
obliged to be led like a child, in the
glaring
sun
, was now directing eight
persons
,
to pull here, and haul there, with all the
dexterity and activity of a man of war's
boatswain

ARGUMENT.
The Author
spouteth
Greek, in a Sea Port:
Its Reception among the Polite: He
attempteth
an Ode, in the Stile of the
Ancients
.
I passed
my time very
agreeably
,
with my preceptor; though I
could not help being
astonished
, that a
man of his acknowledged learning,
should
not,
sometimes
, quote Greek. Of my
acquirements, in that language, I was
still
proud. I attributed the indifference,
with which it was received in the town,
where I had kept
school
, to the
rusticity
and ignorance of the people. As I now
moved in the circles of
polished
life, I
ventured,
sometimes
, when the young
ladies had
such
monstrous
colds, as
that they could not, by the
earnest
persuasions
of the company, be prevailed on
to
sing
; when it had been frequently
observed
,
that it was quaker meeting, to
spout
a few lines from the Iliad. It is
true, they did not interrupt me with,
Fire upon the mountains, run boys, run;
But the
most
sonorous
lines of the
divine
blind bard were received with cold
approbation of
politeness
. One young
lady, alone,
seemed
pleased
. She would
frequently
ask
me, to repeat
those
lines
of
Wabash
poetry. Though once, in
the
sublime
passage
of the hero
Ulysses
,
hanging fifty young maidens, with his
own hands, in the
Odyssey
, I heard the
term, pedant, pronounced with peculiar
emphasis
, by a beau, at my back. If I
had taken the hint, and
passed
my Greek
upon my companions, for Indian, they
would have heard me with rapture. I
have
since
known that worthy,
indefatigable
missionary
to the Indians, the
Reverend
Mr. K, the modern Elliot,
entertain the
same
companies, for whole
evenings, with
speeches
in the aboriginal
of America, as unintelligible to them, as
my
insulted
Greek.
I was
so
pleased
with the young lady,
who approved the Greek heroics, that I
determined to make my
first
essay
, in
metre
,
in an ode,
addressed
to her, by name.
I accordingly
mustered
all the high
sounding
epithets of the immortal Grecian bard,
and
scattered
them with
profusion
, through
my ode. I
praised
her golden locks, and
assimilated
her to the ox eyed Juno;
sent
her a correct copy, and
dispersed
a
number
of others, among her friends. I
afterwards
found, that what I intended as
the
sublimest
panegyric, was received as
cutting
insult
. The golden
tresses
, and
the ox eyed epithet, the
most
favourite
passages
, in my poem, were very
unfortunate
;
as the young lady was remarkable,
for very prominent eyes, which
resembled
what, in
horses
, are called wall eyes.
Her hair was, what is vulgarly called,
carroty
.
Its
unfashionable
colour
she
endeavoured
,
in vain, to conceal, by the
daily
use
of a leaden comb.

ARGUMENT.
The Author in imminent Danger of his Life
in a Duel
.
The
very next morning, after
I had
presented
my ode, and before I had
heard of its reception, a young
gentleman
,
very genteelly
dressed
, entered our
drug room, where I was compounding a
cathartic, with my
spatula
; and, with a
very
stately
air, inquired for Mr. Updike
Underhill. Upon being informed that I
was the
person
, with two of the
most
profound
bows, I had ever
seen
, he advanced
towards me, and with
slow
and
solemn
emphasis
,
said
, then
sir
, I have the honour to
present
you with a billet, from my friend,
Mr.
Jasper
T. Two more bows, as
stately
and low as the former. I took the
letter, which was as big as a
governmental
packet; and, in the
midst
of a large
folio
sheet
, read the following letter, from
Mr.
Jasper
T, a
professed
admirer
of the young lady, to whom I had
addressed
my ode, after the manner of the
Greeks.
Dear Sir
,

a few charges of
powder with you on the morro morning
precisely
at one half hour before

rose
at the lower end of  wharff.

Thursday
A. M. ante
merry dying
.
Though I was engaged to watch that
night, with one of my preceptor's
customers
;
yet, as Mr.
Jasper
T,
seemed
so
friendly and civil, I could not find it
in my heart, to
refuse
him, and replied
that I would, with
pleasure
, wait upon
the gentleman. Sir,
resumed
the bearer,
you are a man of honour, every inch of
you, and I am your
most
obedient,
most
obsequious
, and
most
humble
servant
:
and then, making two profound bows, in
the
shop
, and one more at the door, he
retired
.
He was no
sooner
departed, than
I
sat
down, to
reperuse
this elegant and
very extraordinary billet. I had no
particular
acquaintance with Mr.
Jasper
T, and why he
should
write to me,
at all, puzzled me. The
first
part of the
letter, I doubted not, contained an
approbation
of my ode, and a
request
to be
indulged
with an explanation of
some
of its
peculiar beauties. I began to recollect
illustrations
and parodies, from
some
favourite
passages
in the Iliad. But, what
we were to do, in
wasting
a few charges of
powder, was utterly inexplicable. At
one time, indeed, I thought it an invitation
to
shoot
partridges, and bethought
myself
of
scouring
a long barrelled gun, which
had
descended
as an heir loom in our
family; and had, perhaps, killed Indians,
on Long
Island
, in the hands of my brave
ancestor
, Captain John Underhill. Then
again, I reflected, that the lower end of a
wharf, in a populous town, was not the
most
probable place, to
spring
a covey of
partridges. But what puzzled me
most
,
was his punctual attention to hours, and
even
seconds
. My doubts were all
cleared
,
by the entrance of a fellow
student
, to
whom I communicated the letter. He
was born in Carolina, and
understood
the
whole
business
. It is a challenge,
said
he.
A challenge! exclaimed I. For what?
Why only, repeated he cooly, to fight a
duel, with Mr.
Jasper
T, with
sword
and
pistol
. Pho! replied I, you banter.
Do look at the
conclusion
of the letter.
Will you make me believe that any man,
in his
senses
, would conclude, with all
these
expressions
of
esteem
and
friendship
,
an invitation to give him an opportunity
of cutting my throat, or blowing my brains
out? You have been bred in yankee land,
replied my fellow
student
. Men of
honour
are above the common rules of
propriety
and common
sense
. This letter,
which is a challenge, bating
some
little
inaccuracies of grammar and
spelling
, in
substance
, I
assure
you, would not
disgrace
a man of the
highest
honour; and,
if Mr.
Jasper
T acts as much the
man of honour, on the wharf, as he has
on paper, he will
preserve
the
same
stile
of good breeding and
politeness
there
also
.
While, with one hand, he, with a
deadly longe,
passes
his
sword
through
your lungs, he will take his hat off, with
the other, and bow gracefully to your
corps. Lord deliver me from
such
politeness
,
exclaimed I. It
seems
to me, by
your account of things, that the principal
difference between a man of honour, and
a vulgar murderer, is that the latter will
kill you in a rage, while the former will
write you
complaisant
letters, and
smile
in your face, and bow gracefully, while he
cuts your throat. Honour, or no
honour
,
I am plaguy
sorry
I accepted his
invitation
.
Come, continued my fellow
student
, you
consider
this little affair too
seriously
. I
must
indoctrinate you.
There is no more danger, in
these
town
duels, than in pounding our great
mortar
.
Why, I fought three duels
myself
in Carolina, before I was
seventeen
years
old; and one was for an affront offered to
the negro wench, who
suckled
me: and I
declare I had rather fight ten more, than
pass
once, in a
stage
waggon, over
Horse
Neck. I
see
your
antagonist
has offered
you to bring a
second
. I will go with
you. When you arrive on the ground,
we
seconds
shall
mark out your
position
,
to
stand
in, and to be
sure
, as in
case
of
blood
shed
, we
shall
come into difficulty,
we
shall
place you at a pretty
respectable
distance
. You will then turn a copper
for the
first
-fire; but I
should
advise
you
to grant it to him. This will give him a
vast
idea of your
firmness
, and contempt
of danger. Your
antagonist
, with
banishment
from his country, and the gallows
staring
him in the face, will be
sure
not
to hit you, on his own account. The ball
will
pass
, at
least
, ten rods over your head.
You
must
then
discharge
your
pistol
, in
the air, and offer him to fire again; as,
in the language of the
duellist
, you will
have given him his life,
so
it will be
highly
inconsistent
, in him, to again attempt
yours. We
seconds
shall
immediately
interfere, and pronounce you both men
of honour. The matter in
controversy
will be
passed
over. You will
shake
hands, commence warm friends, and the
ladies will adore you. Oh! Updike, you
are a lucky fellow. I cannot think,
said
I, why Mr.
Jasper
T,
should
have
such
bloody
designs
against
me. I never
intended to affront the young lady.
Lisp
not a word of that, replied my
instructer
,
as you value your reputation on
'change. When he has fired over your
head, you may
confess
what you
please
,
with honour; but however
inoffensive
you may have been, if you make
such
a
confession
before, you are a man of no
honour. You will be
posted
, in the coffee
K
house
, for a coward.
Notwithstanding
the comfortable
address
of my friend, the
thoughts of a premature death, or being
crippled for life,
distressed
me. Nor was
the fear of killing my
antagonist
, and of
what my poor parents would
suffer
, from
my being
exposed
to infamous
punishment
,
less
alarming. I
passed
some
hours
of dreadful anxiety; when I was relieved
from my
distress
, in a way I little
apprehended
.
My challenger, who had lived
some
years in town, as a merchant's clerk,
viewing me as a raw lad, from the
country
,
that would never dare accept his
challenge, when this
messenger
returned,
was petrified with
astonishment
. When
assured
that I had accepted his challenge,
as a man of courage and honour, his heart
died within him. His friend had no
sooner
gone to prepare the
pistols
, than
by communicating the
business
, as a great
secret
, to two or three female friends, the
intended duel was
noised
about town.
The
justices
,
selectmen
, and grand jurors,
convened. Warrants were
issued
, and
constables
dispatched
into all quarters.
I was apprehended, in the
sick
man's
chamber, where I was watching, by the
high
sheriff
, two deputies, three
constables
,
and eleven
stout
assistants
; carried, in the
dead of the night, before the
magistrates
,
where I met my
antagonist
, guarded by a
platoon of the militia, with a colonel at
their head. We were directed to
shake
hands, make friends, and pronounce, on
our honours, that we would drop an affair,
which we had, neither of us, any heart to
pursue
. My acceptance of the challenge,
however unintentional,
established
my
reputation, among the bucks and belles.
The former pronounced me a man of
spunk
and
spirit
; and the latter were
proud of my arm in an evening rural walk
on the paved
street
. None dared to call
me pedant; and, I verily believe that, if
I had
spouted
a whole Iliad, in the ball
room, no one would have ventured to
interrupt
me: for I had proved
myself
a
MAN OF HONOUR.
CHAP. XIII.
The flower of learning, and the bloom of wit.
Young
.
Argument.
The Author is happy, in the Acquaintance
of a Learned Lady
.
In
the circle of my
acquaintance
,
there was a young lady, of not the
most
promising
person
, and, of rather a
vinegar
aspect
, who was
just
approximating
towards thirty years of age.
Though, by avoiding married parties,
mingling with very young company,
dressing
airily;
shivering
in lawn and
sarcenet
,
at meeting, in December; affecting
a
girlish
lisp
,
blush
, and giggle,
she
was
still
endeavouring to ward off that invidious
appellation of old maid. Upon good
grounds, I am led to believe, that the
charity of the tea table had added to her
K 2
years;
because
, from a long acquaintance
with her, I could never induce her to
remember
any event, however trivial, which
happened before Lexington battle. The
girls, of my age,
respected
me, as a man of
spirit
; but I was more fond of being
esteemed
,
as a man of learning. This
young lady loved literature, and lamented
to me her ignorance of the Greek. I gave
her a decided preference to her rivals.
She borrowed books of me, and read
them with
astonishing
rapidity. From
my own little library, and from
those
of
my friends, I procured above
sixty
volumes
for her; among which were Locke
on Human
Understanding
,
Stackhouse
's
Body of Divinity, and
Glass
's works, not
on cookery, but the benignant works of
John
Glass
, the father of Sandiman, and
the Sandimanians; in which collection I
did not however omit Pope's Homer, and
Dryden's Virgil: and, to my
astonishment
,
though I knew that her afternoons
were devoted to the
structure
of caps and
bonnets,
she
perused
those
sixty
volumes
completely, and returned them to me, in
less
than a month. There was one thing
peculiarly
pleasing
to me, as a man of
letters
;
that
she
never made dog leaves, or
soiled
the books; a
slovenly
practice, of
which even great
scholars
are
some
times
guilty. I would, at times, endeavour to
draw her into a
conversation
, upon the
author
she
had recently
perused
. She
would
blush
, look down, and
say
that it
did not become a young girl, like her, to
talk upon
such
subjects
, with a
gentleman
of my
sense
. The compliment it
contained ever rendered the apology
irresistable
. One day,
she
asked
me to
lend her a dictionary. I immediately
procured
for her the great Doctor
Johnson
's,
in two volumes folio. About three days
afterwards,
she
offered to return them.
Knowing that a dictionary was a work,
to which reference was often
necessary
;
and, thinking it might be of
some
service
to evenalady of her learning, I
pressed
her
to keep it longer. When
she
replied,
with the
prettiest
lisp
imaginable, that
they were indeed very pretty
story
books; but,
since
I had lent them to her,
she
had read them all through twice; and
then inquired, with the
same
gentle
lisp
,
if I could not lend her a book, called
Rolling Belly Lettres. I was in
absolute
astonishment
. Virgil's traveller,
treading on the
snake
in the
grass
, was
comparatively in perfect
composure
. I
took a folio under each arm, and
skipped
out of the
house
, as lightly as if I had had
nothing heavier, than a late
antifederal
election
sermon
to carry. This learned
young lady was amazingly affronted, at
my abrupt departure; but, when the
cause
of it was explained to her,
some
months after,
she
endeavoured to
persuade
a journey man tailor, who courted
her niece, to challenge me to fight a
duel, who actually penned a challenge,
upon one of his
master
's
pasteboard
patterns
;
and, I verily believe, would have
sent
it, by his
second
, if he had not been
informed, that my character was
established
,
as a man of honour.

Argument.

Physic
: He
eulogiseth
the
Greek Tongue, and complimenteth the
Professors
of Cambridge, Yale, and
Dartmouth
;
and giveth a gentle Hint to
careles
Readers
.
Disgusted
with the
frivolity
of the young, and the deceit of the
antiquated, I now applied
myself
sedulously
to my
studies
. Cullen, Munroe,
Boerhaave, and Hunter, were my
constant
companions. As I
progressed
in
valuable
science
, my admiration of the Greek
declined. I now found, that Machaon and
Podalirious, the
surgeons
of Homer, were
mere quacks; ignorant of even the
application
of
plaisters
, or the eighteen tailed
bandage: and, in botany, inferiour to the
Indian Powwows; and that the green
ointment, of my learned friend, Doctor
Kitteridge, would have immortalized a
bone
setter
, in the Grecian era, and
translated
him, with
Esculapius
, to a
seat
among
the gods. In
justice
to that
venerable
language, and to the learned
professors
of Cambridge, Yale, and
Dartmouth
,
I will candidly
confess
, that my
knowledge of it, was now, in the
first
year
of my
apprenticeship
, of
some
service
to
me, in now and then finding the root of
the labels cyphered on our gallipots. I
shall
mention a little incident, which
happened
about this time, as it contains a
lesson
,
valuable to the reader, if he has
penetration
enough to
discover
it, and candour
enough
to apply it to
himself
. Though I
applied
myself
closely
to my books; yet,
as hours of relaxation were recommended,
by my preceptor, I
sometimes
indulged
in the dance, and in
sleighing
rides. The
latter being
proposed
, at a time when I
was without the means of paying my club,
I had retired, with
discontent
, to my
chamber; where I accidentally
cast
my
eyes upon a little old
fashioned
duodecimo
bible, with
silver
clasps
, in the corner
of my trunk, a
present
from my mother,
at parting; who had recommended the
frequent
perusal
of it, as my guide in
difficulty, and
consolation
in
distress
.
Young people, in perplexity, always think
of home. The bible reproached me. To
remove the
uneasy
sensation
, and for the
want of
something
more agreeable to do, I
took up the neglected book. No
sooner
had I
unclasped
it, than a guinea dropt
from the leaves, which had been
deposited
there, by the generous care of my
affectionate
mother; and, by my
inexcusable
inattention, had lain there
undiscovered
,
for more than two years. I
hastily
snatched
the brilliant prize, joined my
young companions, and
resolved
that, in
gratitude, I would read a chapter in the
bible, every remaining day of my life.
This
resolution
I then
persevered
in, a
whole fortnight. As I am on this
subject
,
I will
observe
, though no zealot, I have
since
, in the hours of
misery
and poverty,
with which the reader
shall
be acquainted,
in the
sequel
, drawn
treasures
of
support
and
consolation
, from that
blest
book,
more precious than the gems of
Golconda
,
or the gold of Ophir.

Argument.
The Author panegyrizes his Preceptor
.
In
June, one
thousand
seven
hundred and eighty five, I completed
my
studies
. My enlightened,
generous
preceptor,
presented
me with a
Dispensatory
, Cullen's
First
Lines,
and an elegant
shagreen
case
of
pocket
surgical
instruments
. As it is
possible
that
some
friend of his may
peruse
this work,
suffer
me to pay him
a little tribute of gratitude. He was an
unaffected gentleman, and a man of
liberal
science
. In him were united,
the acute
chymist
, the accurate
botanist
,
the
skilful
operator, and profound
physician
. He
possessed
all the
essence
,
without the parade of learning. In
the
most
simple
language, he would
trace the latent
disease
, to its
diagnostic
;
and, from his lips,
subjects
the
most
abstruse
, were rendered familiar
to the unlettered man. Excepting when
he was with his pupils, or men of
science
,
I never heard him
use
a technical
term. He
observed
once, that the bold
truths of
Paracelsus
delighted him;
but, it partook
so
much of the
speech
of our country practitioners, that he
was
disgusted
with the
pomposity
of
Theophrastus
Bombastus
. He was both
an
instructor
and parent to his pupils.
An
instructor
in all the depth of
science
he
possessed
, and a tender parent
in directing them, in the paths of
virtue
and
usefulness
. May he long live,
to
bless
his country with the healing
art; and, may he be hereafter
blest
himself
, in that world, which will open
new
sources
of intelligence, to his
inquiring
mind.

Having

, rendered
certain
merchants and lawyers' clerks, I
concluded
to make a
short
tour, to
Boston
,
for the
purpose
of
purchasing
a few
medical
authors and drugs. I carried letters
of introduction, from my preceptor, to
the late Dr.
Joseph
Gardner, and other
gentlemen of the faculty. The wit and
wine of this worthy man
still
relish
on
recollection. The remarks I made upon
this
hospitable
,
busy
, national, town born
people; my
observations
upon their
manners
,
habits, local virtues,
customs
, and
L 2
prejudices; the elocution of their
principal
clergymen; with anecdotes of
publick
characters, I deal not in private
foibles
;
and a comparitive view of their
manners, at the beginning, and near the
close
of the eighteenth century, are
pronounced
,
by the partiality of
some
friends,
to be original, and to
those
who know the
town, highly
interesting
. If this
homespun
history
of private life,
shall
be
approved
,
these
remarks will be
published
by
themselves
in a future edition of this
work. I quitted
Boston
, with great
reluctance
,
having
seventeen
invitations to
dinner,
besides
tea parties, on my hands.

On
my return, I
passed
through
Cambridge; and, by the peculiar
politeness
and urbanity of the then librarian,
I
inspected
the college
museum
. Here,
to my
surprise
, I found the
curiosities
of
all countries, but our own. When I
inquired for the natural
curiosities
of
New England, with
specimens
of the
rude arts, arms, and antiquities of the
original
possessors
of our
soil
, I was
shewn
,
for the former, an overgrown gourd
shell
,
which held, I do not recollect how many
gallons;
some
of the
shavings
of the
cannon
,
cast
under the
inspection
of Colonel
M; a
stuffed
wild duck, and the
curious
fungus of a turnip: and, for the
latter, a miniature birch canoe,
containing
two or three rag aboriginals with
paddles, cut from a
shingle
. This
last
article, I
confess
, would not
disgrace
the
baby
house
of a child, if he was not
above
seven
years of age. To be more
serious
, I felt then for the reputation of
the
first
seminary
of our land.
Suppose
a Raynal or Buffon
should
visit
us;
repair
to the
museum
of the
university
,
eagerly inquiring after the natural
productions
and original antiquities of our
country

what
must

of the
respectable
rulers of the college, to be
obliged to produce, to them,
these
wretched

specimens

Rabelais
.
Argument.
The Author mounteth his Nag, and
setteth
out, full Speed, to
seek
Practice, Fame,
and Fortune, as a Country Practitioner
.
In
the autumn of one
thousand
seven
hundred and eighty five, I returned
to my parents, who received me with
rapture. My father had reared, for me,
a likely pie bald mare. Our
saddler
equipped
me with
horse
furniture, not
forgetting
the little
saddle
bags, which I
richly
replenished
with drugs,
purchased
at
Boston
. With a few books, and my
surgeon's
instruments
, in my portmanteau,
and a few dollars in my pocket, I
sat
out,
with a light heart, to
seek
practice, fame,
and fortune, as a country practitioner.
My primary object was to obtain a
place of
settlement
. This I imagined an
easy
task
, from my own acquirements,
and the celebrity of my preceptor. My
first
stop
was at a new
township
, though
tolerably well
stocked
with a hardy
laborious
set
of inhabitants. Five
physicians
of eminence had, within a few years,
attempted a
settlement
in this place.
The
first
fell a
sacrifice
to
strong
liquor;
the
second
put his
trust
in
horses
, and was
ruined, by the
loss
of a valuable fire; the
third quarrelled with the midwife, and
was obliged to remove; the fourth
having
prescribed
, rather unluckily, for a
young woman of his acquaintance,
grievously
afflicted with a tympany, went to the
Ohio; and the
last
, being a prudent man,
who
sold
his books and
instruments
for
wild land, and
raised
his own crop of
medicine, was actually in the way of
making a great fortune; as, in only ten
years practice, he left, at his
decease
, an
estate
, both real and
personal
, which was
appraised
at one hundred pounds,
lawful
money. This account was not likely
to engage the attention of a young man,
upon
whose
education twice the
sum
had
been expended.
In the next town, I was
assured
I might
do well, as a
physician
, if I would keep a
grog
shop
, or let
myself
, as a labourer, in
the hay
season
, and keep a
school
in the
winter. The
first
part of the
proposition
,
I heard with patience; but, at the
bare mention of a
school
, I fled the town
abruptly. In the neighbouring town,
they did not want a
physician
, as an
experienced
itinerant doctor
visited
the
place, every March, when the people had
most
leisure
to be
sick
and take
physic
.
He
practised
with great
success
,
especially
in
slow
consumptions
, charged very low,
and took his pay in any thing and every
thing.
Besides
, he carried a mould with
him, to run pewter
spoons
, and was
equally
good at mending a kettle and a
constitution
.

Argument.
The Author encountereth Folly, Ignorance,
Impudence, Imbecility, and Quacks: The
Characters of a Learned, a Cheap, a Safe,
and a
Musical
Doctor
.
At
length, I fixed my
residence
in a town, where four
physicians
were already in full practice, of
such
contrariety
in theory, that I never knew any
two of them agree in any practice, but in
abusing
me, and decrying my
skill
. It
was however four months before I had
M
any practice, except the extracting of a
tooth, from a corn fed girl, who
spun
at
my lodgings, who
used
to look
wistfully
at me, and
ask
, if the doctorer did not
think the tooth ache a
sign
of love? and
say
she
felt dreadfully all over; and the
application of a young virgin, in the
neighbourhood
,
who
wished
to be favoured
with a private lecture upon the virtues of
the
savin
bush
. I verily believe I
might have remained there to this day
unemployed, if my landlord, a tavern
keeper, finding my payment for board
rather tardy, had not, by
sometimes
sending
his boy, in a violent
haste
, to call me
out of meeting, and always vowing I was
cute at the trade, at length drawn the
attention
of the people towards me.
I had now
some
opportunity of
increasing
my information, by
inspecting
the practice of my
seniors
. The principal
physician
had been regularly educated.
As I had been
likewise
, he affected to pay
me
some
attention, on
purpose
to mortify
those
three quacks, who, he
said
, had
picked up their knowledge, as they did
their medicine, by the way
side
. He was
a very formal man, in manners and
practice
.
He viewed
fresh
air highly noxious,
in all
diseases
. I once
visited
a patient
of his, in dog days,
whose
parched tongue
and acrid
skin
denoted a violent fever. I
was
almost
suffocated
, upon entering the
room. The windows were
closed
, and
the cracks
stuffed
with tow; the curtains
were drawn
close
round the patient's bed,
which was covered with a rug, and three
comfortable blankets; a large fire was
made in the room; the door
listed
, and
the key hole
stopped
; while the
Doctor
gravely
administered
irritating
stimulants
to allay the fever. He
carried
a favourite practical author, in his
bags, and after finding the patient's
case
, in the index, pulled out a pair of
money
scales
, and, with the
utmost
nicety,
weighed off the
prescribed
dose
, to the
decimal of a drachm. He told me, as a
great
secret
, that about thirteen years and
one day
past
, he had nearly
destroyed
a
patient, by
administering
half a drachm of
pill cochia more than was
prescribed
in the
books. He was called the learned doctor.
The practice of the
second
town
physician
was directly
opposite
. He
prescribed
large
doses
of the
most
powerful
drugs. If he had been inclined to weigh
his medicine, I believe it would have been
with
gross
weight, rather than troy.
He was an untaught
desciple
of the
English
Ratcliffe,
careless
, daring, and often
successful
. He was admirable in
nervous
cases
,
rose
cancers, and white
swellings
.
Upon the
first
symptoms
of
these
stubborn
disorders
, he would drive them,
and the
subjects
of them, to a
state
of
quiescence
.
He was called the cheap doctor;
because
he always
speedily
cured or
killed.
The third
physician
dealt altogether in
simples
. The only compound he ever
gave, or took, was buttered flip, for a
cough. It was
said
, that, if he did no good,
he never did any harm. He was called
the
safe
doctor.
The fourth
physician
was not
celebrated
for being learned,
safe
, or cheap; but
he had more practice than all the other
three together, for he was a
musical

Sketch of an Hereditary Doctor, and a
Literary
Quack: Critical Operation in
Surgery
.
There
was another
gentleman
in town, who had
some
pretensions
to the character of a
physician
: even the
same
pretensions
with the crowned heads
of Europe, to their
wisdom
, power, and
greatness
. He derived it from his birth;
for he was the
seventh
son
of a
seventh
son
, and his mother was a
doctress
. He
did not indeed bear the name or rank,
but I remember him with the learned;
as he was
sometimes
called to
visit
a
patient
,
at that critical,
interesting
period,
when the other
physicians
had given him
over; but his ordinary practice lay
wholly
among
sheep
,
horses
, and cattle. He
also
could
boast
of
astonishing
success
, and
was as proud and opinionated as the
best
of them; and, for aught I know, it was as
instructive
to hear him talk of his
ringtones
,
wind galls, and
spavins
, as to hear our
first
physician
deseant
upon his
paroxysms
and peripneumony.
Being
sent
for, one day, to attend a man
whose
leg was
said
to be broken, by a fall
from a frame at a
raising
, I found, upon
my arrival at the patient's, that a brother
of the faculty, from the vicinity, had
arrived
before me, and completed the
operation
.
He was celebrated for his
skill
in
desperatecases
; and
universally
allowed to
be a man of learning. He had
prescribed
a gill of burnt brandy, with a pepper pod
in it, to keep up the patient's
spirits
,
under
the operation, and took another
himself
,
to keep his hand
steady
. He
splintered
the fractured limb, with the bone of
two pair of old
fashioned
stays
, he had
caused
to be ript to pieces and bound
round the leg, with all the garters in the
neighbourhood. He bowed gracefully, as
I entered, and regretted extremely that he
had not my
assistance
in
setting
the bones;
and with a loud voice, and the
most
unparalleled
assurance
, began to lay the
case
before me, and amplify the operation he
had performed. Sir,
said
he, when I came
to view the patient, I had little hopes of
saving
his life. I found the two
lesser
bones of the leg, the
musa
and the
tristis
shivered
into a
thousand
splinters
. While
the larger bone, the ambobus, had
happily
escaped
unhurt. Perceiving I could
scarce
refrain from laughing, and was
about
to
speak
;
sir
,
said
he, winking upon
me, I perceive you are one of us men of
science
, and I
wish
you to
suspend
your
opinion, until a private
consultation
;
lest
our
conversation
may alarm the patient
too much, for you know, as the learned
Galen
observes
,
Omne quod exit in
Hum
,
seu
Grcum, five Latinum
Esse
genus neutrum,
sic
invariabile nomen.
By the way, nurse,
these
learned languages
are apt to make the
professors
of them
very
thirsty
. While the toddy was making,
he proceeded. When I pondered this
perilous
,
piteous, pertinacious,
pestiferous
,
petrifying
case
, I immediately thought of
the directions of the learned doctors
Hudibras
and Mc'Fingal, not forgetting, as
the wound was on the leg, the great
Crookshank
's church
history
. When we
had drunk our liquor, of which he took
four fifths, by his direction a new mug
was made a little
stronger
, and we retired
to our
consultation
.
I am much obliged to you,
said
he, for
not
discovering
my ignorance, to
these
people; though, it is ten to one, if I had
not rather convinced the blockheads of
yours, if you had attempted it. A
regular
bred
physician
,
sometime
since
,
attempted
this. He declared, over the
sick
man's bed, that I was ignorant, and
presuming
.
I replied that he was a quack; and
offered to leave our
pretensions
to
knowledge
,
to the company, which
consisted
of
a midwife, two experienced
nurses
, and
some
others, not
so
eminent for learning.
He quoted Cullen and
Chesselden
; and I
Tully and Virgil. Until at length, when
I had nearly
exhausted
my
stock
of cant
phrases
, and he was gaining the
attention
of our judges, I luckily bethought
me of Lilly's Grammar. I began Propria
qu maribus; and before I had got twenty
lines, the opinion of the audience was
apparently
in my favour. They judged
naturally enough, that I was the
most
learned man,
because
the
most
unintelligible
.
This
raised
the doctor's ire
so
much
that from
disputing
me, he began to
berate
them for a parcel of fools,
sots
, and
old women, to put their lives in the hands
of
such
an ignoramus as me. This
quickly
decided the
contest
in my favour. The
old
nurses
raised
their voices, the
midwife
her broom
stick
, and the whole
train of mob caped judges, their
skinny
fists
, and we drove him out of the
house
in triumph. Our victory was
so
complete
,
that, in the military
stile
, we did not
allow him to remain on the field to bury
his dead.
But it is time to tell you who I am.
Sir, I drink your health. In brief,
sir
, I
am the
son
of a
respectable
clergyman,
received a college education, entered into
merchandize, failed, and, by a train of
misfortunes, was obliged to commence
doctor, for
sustenance
. I
settled
myself
in this back country. At
first
I was
applied
to chiefly, in
desperate
cases
; where
no reputation is
lost
, if the patient dies,
and much gained, if he recovers. I have
performed
some
surprising
cures; but
how I cannot tell you, except it was by
allowing my patients
small
beer, or any
thing
else
they hankered after, which I
have heard was
sometimes
efficacious, in
the
crisis
of a fever. But talking of drink,
sir
, I
wish
your health. I believe I have
never injured any
persons
, by my
prescriptions
.
As powdered, burnt
crust
,
chalk, and juice of beets and carrots are
my
most
powerful medicines. We can
be of mutual
service
to each other;
nurse
,
another mug. We doctors find this a
very difficult
case
. As I have borne
down
these
country quacks, by
superiour
effrontery, I can recommend you to full
practice. I will call you to
consult
with
me, in difficult
cases
; for, as I was
saying
,
sir
, I
wish
your good health, mine are all
difficult
cases
; and you, in return,
shall
lend me books, and give me
such
instructions
as will enable me to do good, as well
as get
same
and bread. The
proposal
was
reasonable
. I
closed
with it. He
emptied the third mug, and we returned
to our patient. When the
dressings
were
removed, I
discovered
that there was not
the
slightest
fracture of the fibula or tibia;
but only a
slight
contusion
on the patula,
which would perhaps not have
alarmed
any other
person
, but our patient,
who was a rich old bachelor. I
recommended
an emollient, which my learned
brother
acquiesced
in,
saying
, with his
usual
air, that it was the very application he
intended, having applied the garters
and whalebone, merely to concoct the
tristis
, the
musa
and the ambobus firmly
together.
A young girl, at the door,
shewed
him
a wound on her elbow, which
she
had
received
in
struggling
about red ears at a
husking
; which he gravely pronounced
to be a
fistula
in ano. This gentleman
is really a man of abilities; has
since
made valuable acquirements in the
knowledge
of the human machine, and the
materia
N
medica. If he could be led to
substitute
the aquatic draughts of Doctor
Sangrado, as a
succedaneum
for the
diffusible
stimuli
of Brown, he would
become
useful
in the faculty, and yet
see
happy days.
The doctor kept his word. He read
my books, received my
instructions
, and
recommended me to his patients. But,
as I copied my preceptor, in the
simplicity
of my language I never attempted to
excite the fear of my patients, to magnify
my
skill
; and could not reduce three
fractured
bones in a limb, which contained
but two. My advice was little attended to,
except when backed with that of my
pupil
,
accompanied with frequent quotations
from Lilly. He obtained all the credit
of our
success
; and the people generally
supposed
me a young man of moderate
talents, whom the learned doctor might
make
something
of, in a
course
of years.

A Medical
Consultation
.
A merry
incident gave a
perfect
insight
into the practice of the
several
physicians
I have
just
eulogized. A
drunken jockey, having fallen from his
horse
, at a public review, was taken up
senseless
, and extended upon the long
table
of the tavern. He
soon
recovered
his breath, and groaned
most
piteously
.
As his head
struck
the ground
first
, it was
apprehended by
some
, unacquainted with
its
solidity
, that he had fractured his
skull
.
The faculty
hastened
, from all quarters,
to his
assistance
. The learned,
scrupulous
physician
, after
requesting
that the
doors and windows might be
shut
,
approached
the patient; and, with a
stately
air, declined giving his opinion, as he had
unfortunately left at home his Pringle
on
contusions
.
The cheap doctor immediately
pronounced
the wound a compound fracture,
prescribed
half a
dose
of crude opium, and
called for the trepanning
instruments
.
The
safe
doctor
proposed
brown
paper
,
dipped in rum and cobwebs, to
staunch
the blood. The popular
physician
,
the
musical
doctor, told us a jovial
story
; and then
suddenly
relaxing his
features
,
observed
, that he viewed the
groaning
wretch as a monument of
justice
: that
he, who
spent
his days in tormenting
horses
,
should
now, by the agency of the
same
animal, be brought to death's door,
an event, which he thought ought to be
set
home upon our minds by prayer.
While my new pupil,
pressing
through
the crowd, begged that he might
state
the
case
to the company; and, with an
audible
voice, winking upon me, began. The
learned doctor Nominativo Hoc Caput, in
his
treatise
on brains,
observes
that, the
seat
of the
soul
may be known, from the
affections of the man. The
residence
of
a wife man's
soul
is in his ears; a
glutton's
,
in his palate; a gallant's, in his
lips; an old maid's, in her tongue; a
dancer's, in his toes; a drunkard's, in
his throat. By the way, landlord, give us
a button of
sling
. When we learned
wish
to know if a wound endangers life,
we
consequently
inquire into the
affections
of the patient, and
see
if the wound
injures the
seat
of his
soul
. If that
escapes
,
however deep and
ghastly
the
wound, we pronounce life in no danger.
A
horse
jockey's
soul
gentlemen, I
wish
your healths, is in his heel, under the left
spur
. When I was
pursuing
my
studies
,
in the
hospitals
in England, I once
saw
seventeen
horse
jockies,
some
of whom
were noblemen, killed by the fall of a
N 2
scaffold
in Newmarket, and all wounded
in the heel. Twenty others, with their
arms, backs, and necks broken,
survived
.
I
saw
one noble jockey, with his
nominativo
caret, which is Greek for a nobleman's
head,
split
entirely open. His brains
ran down his face, like the white of a
broken egg; but, as his heel was unhurt,
he
survived
; and his judgment in
horses
is
said
not to be the
least
impaired. Come,
pull off the patient's boot, while I drink his
better health. Charmed with the
harrangue
,
some
of the
spectators
were about
following his directions, when the other
doctors interfered. They had heard him,
with
disdainful
impatience, and now each
raised
his voice, to
support
his particular
opinion, backed by his adherents. Bring
the brown papercompound fracture
cobwebs I
say
hand the trepanning
instruments
give
us
some
tod, and pull off
the boot, echoed from all quarters. The
landlord forbad quarrelling in his
house
.
The whole company
rushed
out, to form
a ring on the green, for the medical
professors
;
and they to a
consultation
of
fity
cuffs. The practitioner in
sheep
,
horses
,
and cattle, poured a
dose
of urine and
molasses
down the patient's throat; who
soon
so
happily recovered as to
pursue
his
vocation
,
swop
horses
three times, play
twenty rubbers of all fours, and get dead
drunk again before
sunset
.

gallipots
,

, empty; and my day book
full of items. To
present
a doctor's bill,
under
seven
years, or until my patients
died, in which I was not nigh
so
fortunate

complete
ruin to my future practice. To draw
upon my father, who had already done
for me beyond his ability, was
still

I had often heard the
southern

spoken
of, as the high road to fortune. I
was told that the inhabitants were
immensely

industry
of their New

brethren. By the advice of our
attorney

I lodged my accompt books in

He advanced me a

pay my travelling

my books and

sat
out, in the

condemning
the illiberality and ignorance of
our own people, which prevented the
due encouragement of genius, and made
them the prey of quacks; intending,

Anecdotes of Doctor Benjamin Franklin,
whom the Author
visits
in Philadelphia
.
I carried
a
request
to the
late Doctor Benjamin Franklin, then
president
of the
state
of
Pennsylvania
, for
certain papers, I was to deliver further
southward
. I anticipated much
pleasure
,
from the interview with this truly great
man: To
see
one, who, from
small
beginnings, by the
sole
exertion of native
genius, and indefatigable
industry
, had
raised
himself
to the pinnacle of politics
and letters; a man, who, from an
humble
printer's boy, had elevated
himself
to
be the
desirable
companion of the great
ones of the earth: who, from trundling
a wheelbarrow in bye lanes, had been
advanced to
pass
in
splendour
, through
the courts of kings; and, from hawking
vile ballads, to the contracting and
signing
treaties, which gave peace and
independence
to three millions of his fellow
citizens, was a
sight
interesting
in the
extreme
.
I found the doctor
surrounded
by
company
,
most
of whom were young people.
He received me with the attention due
to a young
stranger
. He
dispatched
a
person
for the papers I wanted;
asked
me politely to be
seated
; inquired after
the family I
sprang
from; and told me a
pleasing
anecdote of my brave
ancestor
,
Captain Underhill. I found, in the
doctor
,
all that
simplicity
of language, which
is remarkable in the fragment of his life,
published
since
his
decease
; and which
was
conspicuous
in my medical
preceptor
.
I have
since
been in a room a few
hours with Governour Jay, of New
York; have heard of the late Governour
Livingston
, of New
Jersey
; and am now
confirmed in the opinion, I have
suggested
,
that men of genuine merit, as they
possess
the
essence
, need not the
parade
of great knowledge. A rich man
is often plain in his attire, and the man,
who has abundant
treasures
of learning,
simple
in his manners and
stile
.
The doctor, in early life, was
economical
from principle; in his latter days,
perhaps from habit. Poor Richard held
the
purse
strings
of the
president
of
Pennsylvania
.
Permit me to
illustrate
this
observation
, by an anecdote. Soon after
I was introduced, an airy,
thoughtless
relation
,
from a New England
state
,
entered
the room. It
seems
he was on
a party of
pleasure
, and had been
so
much involved in it, for three weeks, as
not to have paid his
respects
to his
venerable
relative. The
purpose
of his
present
visit
was, to
solicit
the loan of a
small
sum
of money, to enable him to
pay his bills, and
transport
himself
home.
He preluded his
request
, with a detail of
embarrassments
, which might have
befallen
the
most
circumspect
. He
said
that
he had loaded a
vessel
for B, and as he
did not deal on credit, had
purchased
beyond
his current
cash
, and could not
readily
procure a draft upon home. The
doctor, inquiring how much he wanted,
he replied, with
some
hesitation
, fifty
dollars. The benevolent old gentleman
went to his
escritoir
, and counted him
out an hundred. He received them with
many
promises
of punctual payment, and
hastily
took up the writing implements,
to draught a note of hand, for the
cash
.
The doctor, who
saw
into the nature of
the borrower's
embarrassments
, better
than he was aware; and was
possessed
with the improbability of ever
recovering
his
cash
again,
stepped
across
the
O
room, laying his hand gently upon
his
cousin
's arm,
said
,
stop
cousin
, we
will
save
the paper; a quarter of a
sheet
is not of great value, but it is worth
saving
:
conveying, at once, a liberal gift
and gentle reprimand for the borrower's
prevarication and extravagance. Since
I am talking of Franklin, the reader may
be as unwilling to leave him as I was.
Allow me to relate another anecdote. I
do not recollect how the
conversation
was introduced; but a young
person
in
company, mentioned his
surprize
, that
the
possession
of great riches
should
ever
be attended with
such
anxiety and
solicitude
;
and
instanced
Mr. RM, who,
he
said
, though in
possession
of
unbounded
wealth, yet was as
busy
and more
anxious, than the
most
assiduous
clerk in
his counting
house
. The doctor took an
apple from a fruit
basket
, and
presented
it to a little child, who could
just
totter
about
the room. The child could
scarce
grasp
it in his hand. He then gave it
another, which occupied the other hand.
Then
choosing
a third, remarkable for its
size
and beauty, he
presented
that
also
.
The child, after many ineffectual attempts
to hold the three, dropped the
last
on the
carpet, and
burst
into tears. See there,
said
the
philosopher
; there is a little
man, with more riches than he can
enjoy
.

Religious
Exercises
in a Soutbern State
.
In
one of the
states
,
southward
of Philadelphia, I was invited, on a
sunday
,
to go to church. I will not
say
which, as I am loth to offend; and our
fashionable
fellow citizens of the
south
arm of the union may not think divine
service
any credit to them. My friend
apologized for inviting me to
so
hum
drum an
amusement
, by
assuring
me, that
immediately after
service
, there was to be
a famous match run for a
purse
of a
thousand
dollars,
besides
private bets, between
'Squire L's imported
horse
, Slammerkin,
and Colonel F's bay mare, Jenny Driver.
When we arrived at the church, we found
a brilliant collection of well
dressed
people
,
anxiously
waiting the arrival of the
parson
, who, it
seems
, had a
small
branch
of the river M to
pass
; and, we
afterwards
learned, was detained by the
absence
of his negro boy, who was to
ferry
him over. Soon after, our impatience
was relieved, by the arrival of the
parson
,
in his canonicals: a young man, not of
the
most
mortified countenance, who,
with a
switch
, called
supple
jack, in his
hand, belaboured the back and head of
the faulty
slave
, all the way from the
water
to the church door; accompanying
every
stroke
, with
suitable
language. He
entered the church, and we followed.
O 2
He
ascended
the reading
desk
, and, with
his face glowing with the
exercise
of his
supple
jack, began the
service
with, I
said
I
will take heed unto my ways, that I
sin
not
with my tongue. I will keep my tongue
as it were with a bridle, when I am before
the wicked. When I
mused
the fire
burned within me, and I
spake
with my
tongue, &c. &c. He preached an
animated
discourse
, of eleven minutes, upon
the practical duties of religion, from
these
words, remember the
sabbath
day, to keep
it holy; and read the fourth commandment,
in the communion. The whole
congregation
prayed
servently
, that their hearts
might be inclined to keep this holy law.
The
blessing
was pronounced; and
parson
and people
hastened
to the
horse
race.
I found the
parson
as much
respected
on
the turf, as upon the
hassoc
. He was
one of the judges of the race;
descanted
,
in the language of the turf, upon the
points of the two rival
horses
, and the
sleeve
of his
cassoc
was heavy laden, with
the principal bets. The confidence of his
parishioners
was not ill founded; for
they
assured
me, upon oath and honour,
that he was a gentleman, of as much
uprightness
as his grace the
archbishop
of
Canterbury. Ay, they would
sport
him
for a
sermon
or a
song
,
against
any
parson
in the union.
The whole of this extraordinary
scene
was novel to me.
Besides
, a certain
staple
of New England I had with me,
called
conscience
, made my
situation
, in
even
the
passive
part I bore in it,
so
awkward and
uneasy
, that I could not
refrain
from
observing
to my friend my
surprise
at the
parson
's conduct, in
chastising
his
servant
immediately before divine
service
. My friend was
so
happily
influenced
by the habits of
these
liberal,
enlightened
people, that he could not even
comprehend the tendency of my remark.
He
supposed
it levelled at the
impropriety
,
not of the
minister
, but the man; not
at the act, but the
severity
of the
chastisement
;
and
observed
, with warmth, that
the
parson
served
the villain right, and,
that if he had been his
slave
, he would
have killed the black
rascal
, if he was
sure
he
should
have to pay an hundred
guineas
to the public
treasury
for him. I
will note here, that the reader is
requested
,
whenever he meets with quotations of
speeches
, in the above
scenes
, excepting
those
during divine
service
, that he will
please
, that is, if his habits of life will
permit
,
to interlard
those
quotations with
about
as many oaths, as they countain
monosylables
.
He may
rest
assured
, that it
will render the
scene
abundantly more
natural. It is true, I might have
inserted
them
myself
, and
supported
thus
doing
,
by
illustrations
and parodies from
grave authors; but I never
swear
profanely
myself
, and I think it
almost
as bad
to oblige my readers to
purchase
the
imprecations
of others. I give this hint of
the introduction of oaths, for the benefit
of my readers to the
southward
of
Philadelphia
;
who, however they may enjoy a
scene
, which reflects
such
honour upon
their country, when
seasoned
with
these
palatable expletives, without them perhaps
would
esteem
it as
tasteless
and vapid,
as a game at cards or billiards, without
bets; or boiled veal or turkey, without
ham.

Success
of the Doctor's
southern
Expedition:
He is in
Distress
: Contemplates a School:
Prefers a Surgeon's Birth, on board a
Ship, bound to Africa, Via London
.
I found
the
southern
states
not more engaging, to a young
practitioner
,
than the northern. In the
sea
ports of both, the
business
was
engrossed
by
men of
established
practice and
eminence
.
In the interiour country, the
people
could not
distinguish
, or encourage
merit. The gains were
small
, and
tardily
collected; and, in both wings of the
union, and I believe every where
else
,
fortune and
same
are generally to be
acquired
in the learned
professions
,
solely
,
by a patient, undeviating application to
local
business
.
If
dissipation
could have afforded
pleaure
,
to a mind yearning after
professional
same
and independence, I might,
so
long as my money
lasted
, have been
happy
,
at the
southward
. I was often
invited
to the turf; and, might have had the
honour of being intoxicated frequently,
with the
most
respectable
characters. An
association
with the well educated of the
other
sex
was not
so
readily attained.
There was a haughty
reserve
, in the
manners of the young ladies. Every
attempt at familiarity, in a young
stranger
,
habituated to the
social
, but
respectful
intercourse
,
customary
in the northern
states
, excited alarm. With my New
England
ideas, I could not help viewing, in the
anxious efforts of their parents and relatives,
to repel every approach to innocent and
even
chastened
intercourse
, a
strong
suspicion
of that virtue, they were
solicitous
to
protect.
Depressed
by the gloomy view of my
prospects
; and determined never to face
my parents again, under
circumstances
,
which would be
burthensome
to them, I
attempted to obtain practice in the town
of F, in Virginia, but in vain. The
very decorum, prudence, and economy,
which would have enhanced my
character
at home, were here
construed
into
poverty of
spirit
. To obtain medical
practice, it was expedient, to
sport
, bet,
drink,
swear
, &c. with my patients. My
purse
forbad the former; my habits of
life the latter. My
cash
wasted
, and I
was near
suffering
. I was obliged to
dispose
of my books, for
present
subsistance
;
and, in that country, books were not the
prime articles of commerce. To avoid
starving
, I again contemplated keeping a
school
. In that country, knowledge was
viewed as a handicraft trade. The
school
masters
, before the war, had been
usually
collected from unfortunate European
youth, of
some
school
learning,
sold
for
their
passage
into America. So that to
purchase
a
school
master
and a negro was
almost
synonimous
: Mr. J n, and
some
other citizens of the world, who had
been
cast
among them, had by their
writings
,
influence, and example, brought the
knowledge of letters into
some
repute,
since
the revolution; but, I believe,
those
excellent men have yet to lament the
general inefficacy of their liberal efforts.
This
statement
, and my own prior
experience
in
school
keeping, would have
determined
me rather to have prefered
labouring
,
with the
slaves
on their
plantations
,
than
sustaining
the
slavery
and
contempt
of a
school
.
When reduced to my
last
dollar; and
beginning to
suffer
, from the
embarrassments
of debt, I was invited, by a
sea
P
captain, who knew my friends, to accept
the birth of
surgeon
, in his
ship
. Every
new
pursuit
has its flattering
prospects
.
I was encouraged by
handsome
wages,
and a privilege in the
ship
, to carry an
adventure
;
for the
purchase
of which, the
owners were to advance me, on account of
my pay. I was to be companion to the
captain, and have a fine chance of
seeing
the world. To quit my home, for all
parts of the union I
considered
as home;
to tempt the perilous ocean, and
encounter
the
severities
of a
sea
faring life, the
diseases
of torrid climes, and perhaps a
total
separation
from my friends and
parents
,
was melancholy; but the
desire
to
see
the world, to acquire practical
knowledge
,
in my
profession
, to obtain
property
,
added to the
necessity
of immediate
subsistance
, and the horrours of a jail,
determined
me to accept his offer. I
accordingly
entered
surgeon
, on board the
ship
Freedom, Captain Sidney
Russell
commander, freighted with tobacco, bound
to London, and thence to the
coast
of Africa. I had little to do in my
passage
to London. My
destination
, as a
surgeon
, being principally in the voyage
from that city to the African
coast
, and
thence to the
West
Indies; and, if I
had not
suffered
from a previous
nausea
or
sea
sickness
, the novelty of the
scene
would have rendered me tolerably
happy. In the perturbation of my
thoughts, I had omitted writing to my
parents of the places of my
destination
.
This
careless
omission
afterwards,
caused
them and me much trouble. We
arrived
safely
in the Downs.

I
shall
content
myself
, with mentioning
the
most
singular
curiosity
, I
saw
in
London
.
It was the celebrated Thomas
Paine, author of Common
Sense
, the
Rights of Man, and other writings,
whose
tendency is to overturn ancient opinions
of government and religion.
I met this
intersting
personage
, at the
lodgings of the
son
of a late patriotic
American
governour;
whose
genius, in the
fine art of
historical
painting,
whose
fortie

whose

leaders, both military and political, in our
glorious revolution; when the love of the
fine arts
shall

disseminated

will leave
posterity
to regret and admire
the imbecility of contemporary patronage.
Thomas Paine
resembled
the great
apostle
to the Gentiles, not more in his
zeal and
subtlety
of argument, than in
personal
appearance; for, like that fervid
apostle
, his bodily
presence
was both
mean and contemptible. When I
saw
him, he was
dressed
in a
snuff
coloured
coat, olive velvet
vest
, drab breeches,
coarse
hose
. His
shoe
buckles of the
size
of half a dollar. A bob tailed wig
covered
that head, which worked
such
mickle
woe to courts and kings. If I
should
attempt to
describe
it, it would be in the
same
stile
and principle, with which
the veteran
soldier
bepraiseth
an old
standard
: the more tattered, the more
glorious. It is probable that this was
the
same
identical wig, under the
shadow
of
whose
curls, he wrote Common
Sense
in
America, many years before. He was a
spare
man, rather under
size
;
subject
to
the extreme of low, and highly
exhilirated
spirits
; often
sat
reserved
in
company
;
seldom
mingled in common chit
chat. But when a man of
sense
and
elocution
was
present
, and the company
numerous
,
he delighted in advancing the
most
unaccountable, and often the
most
whimsical
, paradoxes; which he
defended
in his own
plausible
manner. If
encouraged
by
success
, or the
applause
of
the company, his countenance was
animated
,
with an
expression
of feature,
which, on ordinary
occasions
, one would
look for in vain, in a man
so
much
celebrated
for
acuteness
of thought; but if
interrupted by extraneous
observation
,
by the inattention of his auditory, or in
an irritable moment, even by the
accidental
fall of the poker, he would retire into
himself
, and no
persuasions
could induce
him to proceed upon the
most
favourite
topic.

Argument.
Curious Argument, between Thomas Paine
and the noted Peter Pindar: Peter
etteth
a Wit
Noose
, and catcheth Thomas,
in one of his own Logic traps
.
I heard
Thomas Paine once
assert
, in the
presence
of Mr. Wolcott,
better known, in this country, by the
facetious
name of Peter Pindar, that the
minority
,
in all deliberative bodies, ought,
in all
cases
, to govern the majority.
Peter
smiled
. You
must
grant me,
said
Un
common
Sense
, that the proportion of
men of
sense
, to the ignorant among
mankind
,
is at
least
as twenty, thirty, or even
forty nine, to an hundred. The majority
of mankind are
consequently
most
prone
to errour; and, if we would atchieve right,
the minority ought, in all
cases
, to govern.
Peter continued to
smile
archly. If we
look to experience, continued Paine, for
there are no
conclusions
I more prize
than
those
drawn, not from
speculation
,
but plain matter of fact, we
shall
find an
examination into the debates of all
deliberative
bodies, in our favour. To
proceed
no farther than your country, Mr.
Wolcott, I love to look at home.
Suppose
the
resolutions
of the
houses
of lords
and commons had been determined by
this
salutary
rule; why, the
sensible
minority
would have governed. George
Washington
would have been a private
citizen; and the United States of
America
mere colonies, dependent on the
Brittish
crown. As a patriotic
Englishman
,
will you not
consess
, that this would have
been better than to have
these
United
States independent, with the
illustrious
Washington
at their head, by their
wisdom
confounding the juggling efforts of
your
ministry
to embroil them; and to
have the comfortable
prospect
before you,
that from the extent of their territory,
their maritime
resource
, their natural
encrease
,
the
asylum
they offer to emigrants,
in the
course
of two centuries, Scotland
and Ireland, if the United States have not
too much real pride to attempt it, may
be reduced to the
same
dependence upon
them, as your
West
India
islands
now
have upon you: and even England,
haughty England, thrown in as a make
weight, in the future treaty between them
and the French nation. Peter, who had
listened
with great
seeming
attention, now
mildly replied. I will not
say
but that
your arguments are cogent, though not
entirely convincing. As it is a
subject
Q
rather out of my line, I will, for form
sake
, hold the negative of your
proposition
,
and leave it to the good company,
which is right. Agreed,
said
Paine, who
saw
himself
surrounded
by his admirers.
Well, gentlemen,
said
Peter, with all the
gravity of a
speaker
of the
house
of
commons
;
you, that are of the opinion that the
minority, in all deliberative bodies, ought,
in all
cases
, to govern the majority,
please
to
rise
in the affirmative. Paine
immediately
stood
up
himself
, and, as he had
foreseen
, we all
rose
in his favour. Then
I
rise
in the negative, cried Peter. I am
the
wise
minority, who ought, in all
cases
,
to govern your ignorant majority; and,
consequently
, upon your own
principles
,
I carry the vote. Let it be
recorded
.
This unexpected manuvre
raised
a
hearty laugh. Paine retired from the
presence
of triumphant wit, mortified with
being
soiled
at his own weapons.

Argument.
Reasonable
Conjectures upon the Motives,
which induced Thomas Paine to write
that little Book, called the Age of
Reaon
.
In
the frequent interviews I
had with this celebrated republican
apostle
,
I never heard him
express
the
least
doubt of, or
cast
the
smallest
reflection
upon revealed religion. He
spake
of
the glowing
expressions
of the
Jewish
prophets with fervour; and had quoted
liberally from the
scriptures
, in his
Common
Sense
. How he came to write that
unreasonable
little pamphlet, called the
Age of
Reason
, I am at a
loss
to
conjecture
.
The probable opinion attributes it
to his
passion
for paradox; that this
small
morsel
of infidelity was offered as a
sacrifice
to
save
his life from the devouring
cruelty of
Roberspierre
, that Moloch of
the French nation. It probably had its
desired
effect; for annihilating
revealed
religion could not but afford a
diabolical
pleasure
, to that ferocious wretch and
his inhuman
associates
, who could not
expect
a
sanction
for their cruelties, while the
least
vestige
of any thing
sacred
remained
among men.
When the reign of the
terrorists
ceased
,
an apology was expected; and, even
by the pious, yet catholic American,
would have been received. To the
offended
religion of his country no
propitiatory
sacrifice
was made. This
missionary
of vice has proceeded
proselyting
.
He has added
second
parts, and made
other, and audacious adjuncts to
deism
.
No might nor
greatness
escapes
him.
He has vilified a great prophet, the
saviour
of the Gentiles; he has railed at
Washington
, a
saviour
of his country. A
tasteful
, though irreligious
scholar
might
tolerate a
chastised
scepticism
, if
exhibited
by an acute Hume, or an eloquent
Bolingbroke. But one cannot
repress
the irritability of the fiery
Hotspur

one beholds the pillars of morality

Coast
of Africa:
Manner of
purchasing
Negro Slaves
.
On
the eighteenth of July,
one
thousand
seven
hundred and eighty
eight, I received orders, from my captain,
to join the
ship
in the Downs. I
accordingly
took
passage
in a
post
chaise
; and,
after a rapid journey of
seventy
four
miles, arrived, the
same
afternoon at
Deal; and the next morning entered as
surgeon
, on board the
ship
Sympathy, of
three hundred tons, and thirty eight men,
Captain Sydney
Russell
commander;
bound to the
coast
of Africa, thence
to Barbadoes, and to South Carolina with
a car go of
slaves
.
We were favoured with a clear
sky
and
pleasant
gales; and, after a
short
and
agreeable
voyage, we touched at Porto
Santo
,
one of the Madeira
isles
; where we
watered and
supplied
ourselves
with
fresh
provisions
in abundance, to which
the captain added, at my
request
, a
quantity
of Madeira,
malmsey
, and tent wines,
for the
sick
. We had a fine run, from
the Madiera to the Canary
isles
. The
morning after we
sailed
, I was highly
gratified with a full view of the
island
and
peak of Teneriff; which made its
appearance
the day before,
rising
above the
ocean, at one hundred miles
distance
.
We anchored off Fuertaventura one of
the Canaries, in a good bottom. I went
on
shore
, with the mate, to procure green
vegetables; as I ever
esteemed
them the
specific
for that dreadful
sea
disorder
, the
scurvy
. Before we had reached the
Madeiras
,
though I had
stored
our medicine
chest
with the
best
antiscorbutics
, and
we had a plenty of dried vegetables on
board, yet the
scurvy
had begun to infect
us. A plentiful
distribution
of green
vegetables
,
after our arrival at Porto Santo,
soon
expelled it from the crew. At
Fuertuventura
,
I was delighted with the wild
notes of the Canary bird, far
surpassing
the
most
excellent of
those
I had
seen
in
cages, in the United States.
I was anxious of
visit
the Cape de Verd
islands
; but, our
course
being too far
east
, we ran down to the little
island
of
Goree, to which the contentions of the
English
and French crowns have annexed
its only importance. The French officers
received us with
politeness
, and were
extremely
anxious for news, from their
parent
country. Soon after, we dropt
anchor
off Loango city, upon a
small
well peopled
island
, near the
coast
of
Congo or lower Guinea, in
possession
of
the
Portuguese
. Our captain carried his
papers on
shore
, and, the next day,
weighed
anchor and
stood
in for the continent.
All hands were now employed to unlade
the
ship
, and the cargo was
deposited
in
a
Portuguese
factory, at a place called
Cacongo, near the mouth of the river
Zaire
. The day after our arrival at
Cacongo
,
several
Portuguese
and Negro
merchants
,
hardly
distinguishable
however,
by their manners, employments, or
complexions
,
came to confer with the captain,
about the
purchase
of our cargo of
slaves
.
They contracted to deliver him two
hundred
and fifty head of
slaves
, in fifteen
days' time. To hear
these
men
converse
upon the
purchase
of human beings, with
the
same
indifference, and nearly in the
same
language, as if they were
contracting
for
so
many head of cattle or
swine
,
shocked
me exceedingly. But, when I
suffered
my imagination to rove to the
habitation of
these
victims to this
infamous
,
cruel commerce, and fancied that
I
saw
the peaceful
husbandman
dragged
from his native farm; the fond
husband
torn from the embraces of his
beloved
wife; the mother, from her babes;
the tender child, from the arms of its
parent
;
and all the tender, endearing ties of
natural and
social
affection rended by the
hand of avaricious violence, my heart
sunk
within me. I execrated
myself
, for
even the involuntary part I bore in this
execrable traffic: I thought of my native
land and
blushed
. When the captain
kindly inquired of me how many
slaves
I
thought my privilege in the
ship
entitled
me to
transport
, for my adventure, I
rejected
my privilege, with horrour; and
declared
I would
sooner
suffer
servitude
than
purchase
a
slave
. This
observation
was
received in the great cabin with repeated
bursts
of laughter, and excited many a
stroke
of
coarse
ridicule. Captain
Russell
observed
, that he would not
insist
upon my
using
my privilege, if I had
so
much of the yankee about me. Here is
my clerk, Ned Randolph, will jump at
the chance; though the rogue has been
rather unlucky in the trade. Out of five
and twenty negroes he
purchased
, he
never
carried but one alive to port; and that
poor devil was broken winded, and he
was obliged to
sell
him for half price in
Antigua.
Punctual to the day of the delivery,
the contractors appeared, and brought
with them about one hundred and fifty
negroes, men, women, and children. The
men were
fastened
together, in pairs, by a
bar of iron, with a collar to receive the
neck at each extremity; a long pole
passing
over their
shoulder
, and between each
two, bound by a
staple
and ring, through
which the pole was
thrust
, and thus
twenty, and
sometimes
thirty, were
connected
together; while their conductors
incessantly
applied the
scourge
to
those
,
who loitered, or
sought
to
strangle
themselves
,
by lifting their feet from the ground
in
despair
, which
sometimes
had been
successfully
attempted. The women and
children were bound with cords, and
driven forward by the whip. When
they arrived at the factory, the men were
unloosed
from the poles; but
still
chained
in pairs, and turned into
strong
cells,
built for the
purpose
. The dumb
sorrow
of
some
, the frenzy of others, the
sobbings
and tears of the children, and
shrieks
of the women, when they were
presented
to our captain,
so
affected me
that I was
hastening
from this
scene
of
barbarity, on board the
ship
; when I was
called by the mate, and
discovered
, to my
surprize
and horrour, that, by my
station
in the
ship
, I had a principal and active
part of this inhuman
transaction
imposed
upon me. As
surgeon
, it was my duty to
R
inspect
the bodies of the
slaves
, to
see
,
as the captain
expressed
himself
, that
our owners were not
shammed
off with
unsound
flesh
. In this
inspection
, I
was
assisted
by Randolph the clerk,
and two
stout
sailors
. It was
transacted
with all that unfeeling
insolence
,
which wanton barbarity can inflict
upon
defenceless
wretchedness
. The man,
the affrighted child, the
modest
matron
,
and the timid virgin were alike
exposed
to this
severe
scrutiny
, to
humanity
and common decency equally
insulting
.
I cannot reflect on this
transaction
yet without
shuddering
. I have
deplored
my conduct with tears of
anguish
;
and, I pray a merciful God, the
common parent of the great family of the
universe
, who hath made of one
flesh
and
one blood all nations of the earth, that
the

So goodly and erect, though faulty

,
To
such
unsightly

be
debased
Under inhuman pains?

Argument.
Treatment of the Slaves, on board the Ship
.
Of
one hundred and fifty
Africans
we rejected
seventeen
, as not
merchantable
.
While I was doubting which
to lament
most
,
those
, who were about
being precipitated into all the
miseries
of an American
slavery
, or
those
, whom we
had rejected, as too wretched for
slaves
;
Captain
Russell
was congratulating the
slave
contractors, upon the
immense
good
luck they had, in not
suffering
more by
this lot of human creatures. I
understood
that, what from wounds received by
some
of
these
miserable
creatures, at their
capture, or in their violent
struggles
for
liberty, or attempts at
suicide
; with the
fatigue of a long journey, partly over the
burning
sands
of a
sultry
climate, it was
usual
to
estimate
the
loss
, in the
passage
to the
sea
shore
, at twenty five per cent.
No
sooner
was the
purchase
completed
,
than
these
wretched Africans were
transported
in herds aboard the
ship
, and
immediately precipitated between decks,
where a
strong
chain, attached to a
staple
in the lower deck, was rivetted to the bar,
before
described
; and then the men were
chained in pairs, and
also
hand cuffed,
and two
sailors
with
cutlasses
guarded
every
twenty: while the women and
children
were tied together in pairs with
ropes, and obliged to
supply
the men with
provisions
, and the
slush
bucket; or, if
the young women were
released
, it was
only to gratify the brutal
lust
of the
sailors
:
R 2
for though I cannot
say
I ever was
witness
to an actual rape, yet the frequent
shrieks
of
these
forlorn females in the
births of the
seamen
, left me little charity
to doubt of the repeated
commission
of
that degrading crime. The eve after we
had received the
slaves
on board, all hands
were piped on deck, and ordered to
assist
in manufacturing and knotting cat o'nine
tails, the application of which, I was
informed
,
was always
necessary
to bring the
slaves
to their appetite. The night after
they came on board was
spent
by
these
wretched people, in
sobbings
, groans, tears,
and the
most
heart rending
bursts
of
sorrow
and
despair
. The next morning all
was
still
.
Surprised
by this unexpected
silence
, I
almost
hoped that providence, in
pity to
these
her
miserable
children, had
permitted
some
kindly
suffocation
to put
a period to their
anguish
. It was neither
novel nor unexpected to the
ship
's crew.
It is only the dumb
sit
come on, cried
every one. We will cure them. After
breakfast
, the whole
ship
's crew went
between
decks, and carried with them the
provisions
for the
slaves
, which they one
and all
refused
to eat. A more affecting
group of
misery
was never
seen
.
These
injured Africans, prefering death to
slavery
,
or perhaps buoyed above the fear of
dissolution
, by their religion, which taught
them to look with an eye of faith to a
country beyond the grave; where they
should
again meet
those
friends and
relatives, from
whose
endearments they
had been torn; and where no fiend
should
torment, or
christian
thirst
for gold,
had, wanting other means,
resolved
to
starve
themselves
, and every eye
lowered
the fixed
resolve
of this deadly
intent
.
In vain were the men beaten.
They
refused
to
taste
one mouthful; and,
I believe, would have died under the
operation
,
if the ingenious cruelty of the
clerk, Randolph, had not
suggested
the
plan of whipping the women and
children
in
sight
of the men;
assuring
the
men they
should
be tormented until all
had eaten. What the torments,
exercised
on the bodies of
these
brave Africans,
failed to produce, the feelings of nature
effected. The Negro, who could
undauntedly
expire under the
anguish
of
the
lash
, could not view the agonies of
his wife, child, or his mother; and, though
repeatedly encouraged by
these
female
sufferers
, unmoved by their torments, to
persevere
unto death; yet, though the
man
dared to die, the
father
relented, and
in a few hours they all eat their
provisions
,
mingled with their tears
.
Our
slave
dealers being unable to
fulfil
their contract,
unless
we tarried three
weeks longer, our captain concluded to
remove to
some
other market. We
accordingly
weighed anchor, and
steered
for
Benin, and anchored in the river
Formosa
,
where we took in one hundred and fifteen
more
slaves
. The
same
process
in the
purchase
was
pursued
here; and, though I
frequently
assured
the captain, as a
physician
,
that it was impracticable to
stow
fifty
more
persons
between decks, without
endangering health and life, the whole
hundred and fifteen were
thrust
, with the
rest
, between decks. The
stagnant
confined
air of this infernal hole, rendered
more deleterious by the
stench
of the f
ces, and violent
perspiration
of
such
a
crowd,
occasioned
putrid
diseases
; and,
even
while in the mouth of the
Formosa
, it
was
usual
to throw one or two Negro
corpses
over every day. It was in vain I
remonstrated
to the captain. In vain I
enforced the
necessity
of more
commodious
births, and a more free influx of air for
the
slaves
. In vain I
represented
, that
these
miserable
people had been
used
to the
vegetable diet, and pure air of a country
life. That at home they were
remarkable
for
cleanliness
of
person
, the very rites
of their religion
consisting
,
almost
entirely
,
in frequent ablutions. The captain
was, by this time, prejudiced
against
me.
He
observed
that he did not doubt my
skill
, and would be bound by my advice,
as to the health of
those
on board his
ship
,
when he found I was actuated by the
interest
of the owners; but, he feared, that
I was now moved by
some
yankee
nonsense
about humanity
.
Randolph, the clerk, blamed me in
plain terms. He
said
he had made
seven
African voyages, and with as good
surgeons
as I was; and that it was their
common practice, when an infectious
disorder
prevailed, among the
slaves
, to make
critical
search
for all
those
, who had the
slightest
symptoms
of it, or
whose
habits
of body inclined them to it; to tie
them up and
cast
them over the
ship
side
together, and thus, at one
dash
, to purify
the
ship
.
What
signifies
, added he, the lives
of the black devils; they love to die. You
cannot
please
them better, than by chucking
them into the water
.
When we
stood
out to
sea
, the rolling
of the
vessel
brought on the
sea
sickness
,
which
encreased
the filth; the
weather
being rough, we were obliged to
close
some
of the ports, which ventilated
the
space
between decks; and death raged
dreadfully among the
slaves
. Above two
thirds were
diseased
. It was affecting to
observe
the
ghastly
smile
on the
countenance
of the dying African, as if
rejoicing
to
escape
the cruelty of his
oppressors
.
I noticed one man, who gathered all his
strength
, and, in one
last
effort,
spoke
with great
emphasis
, and expired. I
understood
,
by the
linguist
, that, with his
dying breath, he invited his wife, and a boy
and girl to follow him quickly, and
slaken
their
thirst
with him at the cool
streams
of the fountain of their Great Father,
beyond
the reach of the wild white
beasts
.
The captain was now alarmed for the
success
of his voyage; and, upon my
urging
the
necessity
of landing the
slaves
, he
ordered the
ship
about, and we anchored
near an uninhabited part of the gold
coast
. I conjecture not far from Cape
St. Paul.
Tents were erected on the
shore
, and
the
sick
landed. Under my direction,
they recovered
surprisingly
. It was
affecting
to
see
the effect gentle
usage
had
upon
these
hitherto
sullen
,
obstinate
people
.
As I had the
sole
direction of the
hospital
, they looked on me as the
source
of this
sudden
transition
from the filth and
rigour of the
ship
, to the
cleanliness
and
kindness
of the
shore
. Their gratitude
was
excessive
. When they recovered
so
far as to walk out, happy was he, who
could, by picking a few berries, gathering
the wild fruits of the country, or doing
any menial
services
,
manifest
his affection
for me. Our
linguist
has told me,
he has often heard them, behind the
bushes
, praying to their God for my
prosperity
,
and
asking
him with
earnestness
,
why he put my good
black
soul
into a
white
body. In twelve days all the
convalescents
were returned to the
ship
, except
five, who
staid
with me on
shore
, and
were to be taken on board the next day.

Stripes and a dungeon.

Argument.
The Author taken Captive by the Algerines
.
Near
the
close
of the fourteenth
of November, one
thousand
seven
hundred
and eighty eight, as the
sun
was
sinking
behind the mountains of Fundia, I
sat
at the door of my tent, and perceived
our
ship
, which lay at one mile's
distance
,
getting under way, apparently in great
haste
. The jolly boat, about ten
minutes
before, had made towards the
shore
;
but was recalled by a
musket
shot
from the
ship
. Alarmed by this unexpected
manuvre
,
I ran to the top of a
small
hill, back
of the
hospital
, and plainly
discovered
a
square
rigged
vessel
in the offing,
endeavouring
to lock our
ship
within the land;
but a land breeze
springing
up from the
north
east
, which did not extend to the
strange
vessel
, and our
ship
putting out
all her light
sails
, being well provided with
ring
sail
,
scudding
sails
, water
sails
, and
driver, I could perceive
she
out
sailed
her.
It was
soon
so
dark that I
lost
sight
of
both, and I
passed
a night of extreme
anxiety, which was
increased
by, what I
conjectured to be, the
flashes
of guns in
the
south
west
; though at too great
distance
for me to hear the reports.
The next morning no
vessels
were to be
seen
on the
coast
, and the
ensuing
day
was
spent
in a
state
of dreadful
suspense
.
Although I had
provisions
enough with
me for
some
weeks, and was
sheltered
by
our tents, yet to be
separated
from my
friends and country, perhaps forever, and
to fall into the hands of the barbarous
people, which
infested
this
coast
, was
truly
alarming. The five Africans, who
were with me, could not conceal their
joy, at the departure of the
ship
. By
signs
they
manifested
their affection
towards
me; and, when I
signified
to them
that the
vessel
was gone not to return,
they clapped their hands, and pointing
inland,
signified
a
desire
to convey me
to their native country, where they were
sure
I
should
be happy. By their
consultation
,
I could
see
that they were
totally
ignorant of the way. On the third
day towards evening, to my great joy, I
saw
a
sail
approaching the
shore
, at the
prospect
of which my African
associates
manifested
every
sign
of horrour. I
immediately
concluded that no great blame
would
arise
, from my not detaining five
men, in the
absence
of the
ship
; and I
intimated to them that they might
conceal
themselves
in the
brush
and
escape
.
Four quitted me; but one, who made me
comprehend, that he had a beloved
son
among the
slaves
,
refused
to go, prefering
the company of his child, and
slavery
itself
,
to
freedom
and the land of his
nativity
.
I retired to
rest
,
pleased
with the
imagination of
soon
rejoining my friends,
and proceeding to my native country.
On the morning of the fourth day, as I
was
sleeping
in my tent with the
affectionate
negro at my feet, I was
suddenly
awakened, by the blowing of conch
shells
,
and the
sound
of uncouth voices. I
arose
to
dress
myself
, when the tent was
overset
, and I received a blow from the
back of a
sabre
, which levelled me to the
earth; and was immediately
seized
and
bound by
several
men of
sallow
and
fierce demeanour, in
strange
habits, who
spake
a language I could not
comprehend
.
With the negro, tents, baggage,
and
provisions
, I was carried to the boat,
which, being loaded, was immediately
pushed
off from the
shore
, and rowed
towards
a
vessel
, which I now, for the
first
time, noticed, and had no doubt but it was
S 2
the
same
, which was in
pursuit
of the
Sympathy. She was rigged differently
from any I had ever
seen
, having two
masts
, a large
square
main
sail
, another of
equal
size
,
seized
by the middle of a main
yard to her fore
mast
, and, what the
sailors
call, a
shoulder
of mutton
sail
abaft;
which, with top
sails
and two banks of
oars, impelled her through the water with
amazing velocity: though, from the
clumsiness
of her rigging, an American
seaman
would never have pronounced
her a good
sea
boat. On her main
mast
head was a broad black pennant, with a
half moon, or rather
crescent
, and a drawn
sabre
, in white and red, emblazoned in
the middle. The
sides
of the
vessel
were
manned as we approached, and a tackle
being
let down, the hook was attached to
the cord, which bound me, and I was
hoisted
on board in the twinkling of an
eye. Then, being unbound, I was carried
upon the quarter deck, where a man, who
appeared to be the captain, glittering in
silks
, pearl, and gold,
set
cross
legged upon
a velvet
cushing
to receive me. He was
nearly encircled by a band of men, with
monstrous
tufts of hair on their upper
lips,
dressed
in habits of the
same
mode
with their leader's, but of
coarser
contexture
,
with drawn
scimitars
in their hands,
and by his
side
a man of lighter
complexion
,
who, by the captain's command,
inquired
of me, in good
English
, if I was
an
Englishman
. I replied I was an
American
,
a citizen of the United States.
This was no
sooner
interpreted to the
captain than, at a
disdainful
nod of his
head, I was again
seized
, hand cuffed,
and
thrust
into a dirty hole in the fore
castle
, where I lay twenty four hours,
without
straw
to
sleep
on, or any thing
to eat or drink. The treatment we gave
the unhappy Africans, on board the
Sympathy, now came full into my mind;
and, what was the more mortifying, I
discovered
that the negro who was, captured
with me, was at liberty, and fared as well
as the
sailors
on board the
vessel
. I had
not however been confined more than
one half hour, when the interpreter came
to examine me privately
respecting
the
destination
of the
ship
, to which he
suspected
I belonged; was anxious to know
if
she
had her full cargo of
slaves
; what
was her force; whether
she
had
English
papers on board; and if
she
did not
intend
to
stop
at
some
other African port.
From him I learned that I was
captured
by an Algerine Rover, Hamed
Hali
Saad captain; and
should
be carried
into
slavery
at Algiers. After I had lain
twenty four hours in this
loathsome
place,
covered with vermin, parched with
thirst
,
and fainting with hunger, I was
startled
at a light, let through the hatchway, which
opened
softly
, and a hand
presented
me
a cloth, dripping with cold water, in
which a
small
quantity of boiled rice was
wrapped. The door
closed
again
softly
,
and I was left to enjoy my good fortune
in the dark. If Abraham had indeed
sent
Lazarus to the rich man, in torment,
it appears to me, he could not have
received a greater
pleasure
, from the cool
water on his tongue, than I experienced,
in
sucking
the
moisture
from this cloth.
The next day, the
same
kindly hand
appeared
again, with the
same
refreshment
.
I begged to
see
my benefactor. The door
opened further, and I
saw
a countenance
in tears. It was the face of the grateful
African, who was taken with me. I was
oppressed
with gratitude. Is this,
exclaimed
I, one of
those
men, whom we
are taught to vilify as beneath the human
species
, who brings me
sustenance
,
perhaps
at the
risk
of his life, who
shares
his
morsel
with one of
those
barbarous men,
who had recently torn him from all he
held dear, and
whose
base
companions
are now
transporting
his darling
son
to
a grievous
slavery
? Grant me, I
ejaculated
,
once more to
taste
the freedom of
my native country, and every moment of
my life
shall
be dedicated to preaching
against
this
detestable
commerce. I will
fly to our fellow citizens in the
southern
states
; I will, on my knees, conjure them,
in the name of humanity, to
abolish
a
trafic, which
causes
it to bleed in every
pore. If they are deaf to the pleadings
of nature, I will conjure them, for the
sake
of
consistency
, to
cease
to deprive
their fellow creatures of freedom, which
their writers, their orators,
representatives
,
senators
, and even their
constitutions
of
government, have declared to be the
unalienable
birth right of man. My
sable
friend had no
occasion
to
visit
me a third
time; for I was taken from my
confinement
,
and, after being
stripped
of the few
clothes, and the little property I chanced
to have about me, a log was
fastened
to
my leg by a chain, and I was permitted
to walk the fore
castle
of the
vessel
, with
the African and
several
Spanish
and
Portuguese
prisoners
. The treatment of
the
slaves
, who plied the oars, the
management
of the
vessel
, the order which
was
observed
among this ferocious race,
and
some
notices of our voyage, might
afford
observations
, which would be highly
gratifying to my readers, if the limits of
this work would permit. I will
just
observe
however that the regularity and
frequency
of their devotion was
astonishing
to me, who had been taught to
consider
this people as the
most
blasphemous
insidels
.
In ten days after I was captured, the
Rover
passed
up the
straits
of Gibralter, and I
heard the
garrison
evening gun fired from
that formidable rock; and the next
morning
hove in
sight
of the city of Algiers.

Hanserd Knollys
these
Greeting.
Worthee and Beloved
,
Remembrin my kind love to Mr.
Hilton
,
I now
send
you
some
note of my
tryalls at
Boston
.Oh that I may come
out of this, and al the lyke tryalls, as
goold
sevene
times puryfyed in the
furnice
.
After the rulers at
Boston
had fayled
to
fastenne
what Roger Harlakenden was
pleased
to call the damning errours of
Anne
Hutchinson
upon me, I looked to
be
sent
away in peace; but Governour
Winthrop
sayd
I
must
abide the
examining
of ye church; accordingly, on the
thyrd day of ye weeke, I was convened
before
them.Sir Harry Vane, the
governour
,
Dudley, Haines, with
masters
Cotton
,
Shepherd, and Hugh Peters
present
,
with others.They prepounded that I
was to be examined, touching a certain act
of adultery I had committed, with one
mistress
Miriam Wilbore, wife of
Samuel
Wilbore, for carnally looking to
luste
after her, at the lecture in
Boston
, when
master
Shepherd expounded.This
mistress
Miriam hath
since
been dealte with,
for coming to that lecture with a pair of
wanton open workt gloves,
slit
at the
thumbs and fingers, for the
purpose
of
taking
snuff
; for, as
master
Cotton
observed
,
for what end
should
those
vaine
opennings
be, but for the intent of taken
filthy
snuff
; and he quoted Gregory
Nazianzen
upon good works.
Master
Peters
said
, that
these
opennings were Satan's
port holes of firy temptatione.
Mistress
Miriam offerd in
excuse
of her vain attire,
that
she
was newle married, and appeared
in her bridall arraye.
Master
Peters
said
,
that marriage was the
ocasion
that the
Devil tooke to
caste
his firy darts, and lay
his pit falls of temptation, to catche frale
flesh
and bloode. She is to be further
dealt with for taken
snuff
. How the
use
of the good creature tobaccoe can be
an offence I cannot
see
.Oh my beloved,
how
these
prowde
pharisees
labour aboute
the minte and cummine. Governour
Winthrop
inquired of mee, if I
confessed
the
D 2
matter. I
said
I
wished
a coppy of there
charge.Sir Harry Vane
said
, there was
no neede of any coppie,
seeing
I knew I
was guiltee. Charges being made out
where there was an uncertantie whether
the
accused
was guiltie or not, and to
lighten the
accused
into the nature of his
cryme, here was no need.
Master
Cotton
said
, did you not look upon
mistress
Wilbore? I
confessed
that I did. He
said
then you are verelie guiltie, brother
Underhill
.
I
said
nay, I did not look at the
woman
lustfully
.
Master
Peters
said
,
why did you not look at
sister
Nowell or
sister
Upham?
I
said
, verelie they are not
desyrable
women, as to temporale graces
.
Then Hugh Peters and al cryed, it is
enough
,
he hath
confessed
, and
passed
to
excommunication. I
sayd
where is the
law by which you condemne me.
Winthrop
said
, there is a committee to draft
laws. Brother Peters are you not on that
committee, I am
sure
you have maide a law
againste
this cryinge
sin
. Hugh Peters
replyed that he had
such
a law in his
minde, but
had not
writtene it downe.
Sir Harry Vane
said
, it is
sufficient
.
Haynes
said
,
ay, law enough for
antinomians
.
Master
Cotton tooke a bible from
his coate and read
whoso
looketh on a

Description
of
his
Person
, Court and Guards:
Manner
of
selecting
the Tenth
Prisoner
.
We
saluted
the
castle
with
seven
guns, which was returned with
three, and then entered within the
immense
pier, which forms the port. The
prisoners
, thirty in number, were
conveyed
to the
castle
, where we were
received
with great parade by the Dey's
troops or cologlies, and guarded to a
heavy
strong
tower of the
castle
. The
Portuguese
prisoners
, to which nation
the Algerines have the
most
violent
antipathy
,
were immediately, with every
mark of contempt,
spurned
into a dark
dungeon beneath the foundations of the
tower, though there were
several
merchants
of eminence, and one young
nobleman
,
in the number. The Spaniards,
whom the Dey's
subjects
equally
detest
,
and fear more, were confined with me in
a grated room, on the
second
story
. We
received, the
same
evening, rations
similar
to what, we
understood
, were
issued
to the
garrison
. The next day, we were
all led to a
cleansing
house
, where we
were cleared from vermin, our hair cut
short
, and our beards
close
shaved
; thence
taken to a bath, and, after being well
bathed, we were clothed in
coarse
linen
drawers, a
strait
waistcoat
of the
same
without
sleeves
, and a kind of tunic or
loose
coat over the whole, which, with a
pair of leather
slippers
, and a blue cotton
cap, equipped us, as we were informed,
to appear in the
presence
of the Dey,
who was to
select
the tenth
prisoner
from
us in
person
. The next morning, the
dragomen or interpreters, were very
busy
in
impressing
upon us the
most
profound
respect
for the Dey's
person
and
power, and teaching us the
obeisance
necessary
to be made in our approaches to this
august
potentate. Soon after, we were
paraded; and Captain Hamed
presented
each of us with a paper, written in a
base
kind of Arabic,
describing
, as I was
informed
,
our
persons
, names, country, and
conditions in life;
so
far as our captors
could collect from our
several
examinations
.
Upon the back of each paper was
a mark or number. The
same
mark was
painted upon a flat oval piece of wood,
somewhat
like a painter's palette, and
suspended
by a
small
brass
chain to our
necks, hanging upon our
breasts
. The
guards then formed a hollow
square
.
We were blind folded until we
passed
the fortifications, and then
suffered
to
view the city, and the
immense
rabble,
which
surrounded
us, until we came to
the palace of the Dey. Here, after much
military parade, the gates were thrown
open, and we entered a
spacious
court
yard, at the upper end of which the Dey
was
seated
, upon an eminence, covered
with the
richest
carpeting fringed with
gold. A circular canopy of
Persian
silk
was
raised
over his head, from which
were
suspended
curtains of the
richest
embroidery, drawn into
festoons
by
silk
cords and
tassels
, enriched with pearls.
Over the eminence, upon the right and
left, were canopies, which
almost
vied in
B 2
riches with the former, under which
stood
the Mufri, his numerous Hadgi's, and
his principal officers, civil and military;
and on each
side
about
seven
hundred
foot guards were drawn up in the form
of a half moon.
The
present
Dey, Vizier
Hassen
Bashaw
,
is about forty years of age, five feet
ten inches in height, inclining to
corpulency
,
with a countenance rather comely
than commanding; an eye which betrays
sagacity
, rather than
inspires
awe:
the latter is
sufficiently
inspired
by the
sierce
appearance of his guards, the
splendour
of his attendants, the grandeur of
his court, and the magnificence of his
attire
.
He was arrayed in a
sumptuous
Turkish
habit. His feet were
shod
with
buskins
, bound upon his legs with
diamond
buttons in loops of pearl; round his
waist
was a broad
sash
, glittering with
jewels
,
to which was
suspened
a broad
scimitar
,
the hilt of which dazzled the eye
with brilliants of the
first
water, and the
sheath
of which was of the
finest
velvet,
studded
with gems and the
purest
gold.
In his
scarf
was
stuck
a poignard and
pair of
pistols
of
exquisite
workmanship
.
These
pistols
and poignard were
said
to
have been a
present
from the late
unfortunate
Louis the
sixteenth
. The former
was of pure gold, and the value of the
work was
said
to exceed that of the
precious
mettle two hundred times. Upon
the Dey's head was a turban with the
point erect, which is peculiar to the
royal
family. A large diamond
crescent
shone
conspicuous
in the front, on the
back of which a
socket
received the quills
of two large
ostrich
feathers, which
waved
in graceful
majesty
over his head.
The
prisoners
were directed by turns to
approach the foot of the eminence.
When within thirty paces, we were made
to throw
ourselves
upon the earth and
creep towards the Dey, licking the
dust
as
a token of reverence and
submission
. As
each captive approached, he was
commanded
to
rise
, pull of his
slippers
, and
stand
with his face bowed to the ground,
and his arms
crossed
over his
breast
.
The chieux or
secretary
then took the
paper he carried and read the
same
. To
some
the Dey put
questions
by his
drogoman
,
others were
dismissed
by a
slight
nod of his head. After
some
consultation
among the chief men, an officer
came to where the
prisoners
were
paraded
,
and called for three by the
number
,
which was marked on their
breasts
.
The Dey's prerogative gives him the
right to
select
the tenth of all
prisoners
;
and, as the
service
or
ransom
of them
constitutes
one part of his revenue, his
policy is to
choose
those
,
whose
friends
or wealth would be
most
likely to
enrich
his coffers. At this time, he
selected
two wealthy
Portuguese
merchants,
and a young nobleman of the
same
nation
,
called Don Juan Combri.
Immediately
after this
selection
, we were
carried
to a
strong
house
, or rather
prison
,
in the city, and there guarded by an
officer
and
some
of the crew of the Rover,
that had taken us. The remainder
of us being
considered
as private
property
,
another
selection
was made by the
captain and owners of the Rover; and
all
such
, as could probably pay their
ransom
in a
short
time, were removed
into a place of
safety
and
suffered
only a
close
consinement
. The remnant of my
companions being only eleven,
consisted
of the Negro
slave
, five
Portuguese
, two
Spanish
sailors
, an Italian fiddler, a
Dutchman
from the Cape of Good Hope, and
his Hottentot
servant
. As we could
proffer
no probability of
ransom
we were
reserved
for another fate.

The Slave Market
.
On
the next market day, we
were
stripped
of the
dress
, in which
we appeared at court A napkin was
wrapped round our loins, and a
coarse
cloak thrown over our
shoulders
. We
were then
exposed
for
sale
in the market
place, which was a
spacious
square
,
inclosed
by ranges of low
shops
, in different
sections
of which were
exposed
the
various
articles intended for
sale
. One
section
was gay with flowers; another
exposed
all the fruits of the
season
.
Grapes, dates, pomegranates, and
oranges
lay in tempting
baskets
. A third was
devoted to
sallads
and pot herbs; a
fourth to milk and cream. Between
every
section
was a
small
room, where
those
, who come to market, might
occasionally
refresh
themselves
with a pipe of
tobacco, a cud of opium, a
glass
of
sherbet
,
or other cooling liquors. Sherbet is
composed
of lemons, oranges,
sugar
, and
water. It is what we, in New England,
call beverage. In the centre of the
market
,
an oblong
square
was railed in,
where the dealers in
beasts
and
slaves
exposed
their commodities for
sale
. Here
were camels, mules,
asses
, goats, hares,
dromedaries, women and men, and all
other creatures, whether for appetite or
use
; and I
observed
that the
purchasers
turned from one article to the other, with
equal indifference. The women
slaves
were concealed in a latticed
shop
, but
the men were
exposed
in open view in a
stall
,
situated
between
those
appropriated
to the
asses
and to the kumrah, a
wretched
looking, though
serviceable
animal in
that country, propagated by a jack upon
a cow. I now
discovered
the
reason
of
the alternation in our
dress
; for, as the
people here, no more than in New
England
,
love to buy a pig in the poke, our
loose
coats were
easily
thrown open, and
the
purchaser
had an opportunity of
examining
into the
state
of our bodies. It
was
astonishing
to
observe
, how critically
they examined my
muscles
, to
see
if I was
naturally
strong
; moved my limbs in
various
directions, to detect any latent
lameness
or injury in the parts; and
struck
suddenly
before my eyes, to judge
by my winking, if I was clear
sighted
.
Though I could not
understand
their
language, I doubt not, they
spoke
of my
activity,
strength
, age, &c. in the
same
manner, as we at home talk in the
swop
of a
horse
. One old man was very
critical
in his examination of me. He made
me walk, run, lie down, and lift a weight
of about
sixty
pounds. He went out,
and
soon
returned with another man.
They conferred together, and the
second
was more critical in his examination than
the
first
. He obliged me to run a few rods,
and then laid his hand
suddenly
to my
heart, to
see
, as I conjecture, if my wind
was good. By the old man I was
purchased
.
What the price given for me
was, I cannot tell. An officer of the
market
attested
the contract, and I was
obliged
by the
master
of the
shop
, who
sold
me upon
commissions
, for the benefit of
the concerned in the Rover, to lie down in
the
street
, take the foot of my new
master
,
and place it upon my neck; making
to him, what the lawyers call, attornment.
I was then
seized
by two
slaves
, and led
to the
house
of my new
master
.
Perhaps the free citizen of the United
States may, in the warmth of his
patriotism
,
accuse
me of a
tameness
of
spirit
, in
Vol. II. C
submitting
to
such
gross
disgrace
. I will
not
justify
myself
. Perhaps I ought to
have
asserted
the dignity of our nation,
in
despite
of
bastinadoes
, chains, or even
death
itself
. Charles the twelfth of
Sweden
has however been
stigmatized
by the
historian
, as a madman, for
opposing
the
insulting
Turk, when a
prisoner
, though
assisted
by nearly two hundred brave men.
If any of my dear countrymen
censure
my
want of due
spirit
, I have only to
wish
him in my
situation
at Algiers, that he
may avail
himself
of a noble opportunity
of
suffering
gloriously
for his country.
CHAP. III.
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain
fantasy
,
Which is as thin of
substance
as the air,
And more
inconstant

Who woos
Even now the frozen
bosom
of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew dropping
south

The
higher his rank in
society
,
the further is man removed from
nature
.
Grandeur draws a circle round
the great, and often excludes from them the
finer feelings of the heart. The
wretched
are all of one family; and ever regard
each other as brethren. Among the
slaves
of my new
master
, I was received
with pity, and treated with
tenderness
,
bordering upon fraternal affection. They
could not indeed
speak
my language, and
I was ignorant of theirs; but, by dividing
the
scanty
meal,
composing
my couch of
straw
, and alleviating my more rugged
labours
,
they
spake
that
universal
language
of benevolence, which needs no
linguist
to interpret.
It is true, I did not meet, among my
fellow
slaves
, the rich and the noble, as
the
dramatist
and the
novelist
had taught
me to expect. To betray a
weakness
I
will
confess
that,
sometime
after I was
captured, I often
suffered
fancy to cheat
me of my weary moments, by
portraying
those
scenes
, which had often
amused
me in my
closet
, and delighted me
on the
stage
. Sometimes, I even
contemplated
with
pleasure
the company and
converse
of my fellow
slaves
. I expected
to find them men of rank at
least
, if not
of learning. I fancied my
master
's cook
an
English
lord; his valet an Italian
duke; his groom a knight of Malta; and
even his foot boy
some
little lively French
marquis. I fancied my future
master
's
head gardener, taking me one
side
,
professing
the
warmest
friendship
, and telling
me in confidence that he was a
Spanish
Don with forty noble names; that he had
fallen in love with my
master
's fair
daughter,
whose
mother was a
christian
slave
; that the young lady was equally
charmed with him; that
she
was to rob
her father of a rich
casket
of jewels, there
being no
dishonour
in
stealing
from an
infidel; jump into his arms in boy's
clothes that very night, and
escape
by a
vessel
, already provided, to his native
country. I
saw
in imagination all this
accomplished
. I
saw
the lady
descend
the rope ladder; heard the old man and
his
servants
pursue
;
saw
the lady carried
off
breathless
in the arms of her knight;
arrive
safe
in Spain; was
present
at the
C 2
lady's
baptism
into the catholic church,
and at her marriage with her noble
deliverer
.
I was
myself
almost
stifled
with the
caresses
of the noble family, for the part I
had borne in this perilous adventure; and
in fine married to Donna
some
body, the
Don's beautiful
sister
; returned into my
own country, loaded with beauty and
riches; and perhaps was
aroused
from my
reverie by a poor fellow
slave
,
whose
extreme
ignorance had
almost
blunted the
sensibility
of his own
wretchedness
.
Indeed,
so
sweet
were the
delusions
of
my own fancy, I am loth to
destroy
the innocent gratification, which the
readers
of novels and plays enjoy from the
works of a Behn and a Colman; but the
sober
character of the
historian
compels
me to
assure
my readers that, whatever
may have happened in the
sixteenth
century
,
I never
saw
during my captivity, a
man of any rank, family, or fortune
among
the menial
slaves
. The Dey, as I
have already
observed
,
selecting
his tenth
prisoner
from
those
, who would
most
probably afford the
richest
ransom
,
those
concerned in the captures are influenced
by the
same
motive. All, who may be
expected to be
ransomed
, are deprived
of their liberty, it is true; but fed,
clothed, and never put to manual labour,
except as a
punishment
for
some
actual
crime, or attempting to recover their
liberty
.
The menial
slaves
are generally
composed
of the dregs of
those
nations,
with whom they are at war; but, though
my fellow
slaves
were
grossly
illiterate, I
must
do them the
justice
to
say
, they had
learned well the kinder virtues:
those
virtues
,
which
schools
and colleges often fail
to teach, which, as
Aristotle
well
observes
,
are like a flame of fire. Light them up
in whatever climate you will, they burn
and
shine
ever the
same

Account of my
Master
Abdel Melic:
description
of his
House
, Wife, Country
House
, and
severe
Treatment of his
Slaves
.
The
name of my
master
was Abdel Melic. He had been
formerly
an officer in the Dey's troops, and, it
was
said
, had rendered the Dey's-father
some
important
service
in an
insurrection
,
and was therefore highly
respected
; though
at that time he had no publick
employment
.
He was an
austere
man; his
natural
severity
being probably
encreased
by
his employment as a military officer. I
never
saw
the face of any other
person
in
his family, except the male
slaves
. The
houses
of the Algerines are nearly all
upon
the
same
model;
consisting
of a building
towards the
street
of one or two
stories
, which
is occupied by the
master
and male
domestics
,
and which is connected by a gallery
upon
the ground, if the
house
is of one
story
;
if of two, the entrance is above
stairs
, to a
building of nearly the
same
size
behind,
which has no windows or lattices at the
side
, but only looking into a garden, which
is always
surrounded
by a high wall. In
these
back apartments the women are
lodged, both wives and
slaves
. My
master
had a wife, the daughter of a
principal
officer in the Dey's court, and, to my
surprise
, had only one. I found it to be
a vulgar errour, that the Algerines had
generally
more. It is true they are allowed
four by their law; but they generally
find, as in our country, one lady
sufficient
for all the comforts of connubial life; and
never take another, except family alliance
or
barrenness
renders it eligible or
necessary
.
The more I became acquainted
with their
customs
, the more was I
struck
with their great
resemblance
to the
patriarchical
manners,
described
in holy
writ. Concubinage is allowed; but few
respectable
people
practise
it, except for
the
sake
of heirs. With the Algerines
the
barrenness
of a
Rachel
is
sometimes
compensated
to the
husband
, by the
fertility
of a
Bilhah
. After I had lived in
this town
house
about three weeks,
during
which time I was clothed after the
fashion
of the country, my
master
moved,
with his whole family, to a country
house
on the river Saffran. Our journey,
which was about twelve miles, was
performed
in the evening. Two carriages,
resembling
our travelling waggons,
contained
the women. Only the bodies of
them were latticed, and
furnished
with
curtains
to cover them in the day time, which
were rolled up in the evening. Two
slaves
preceded the carriages. Abdel
Melic followed on
horseback
, and I
accompanied
a baggage waggon in the rear.
When we arrived at the country
house
,
the garden gates were thrown open, and
the carriages with the women entered.
The men were introduced to the
front apartments. I found here
several
more
slaves
, equally ignorant and equally
attentive and kind towards me, as
those
I had
seen
in the town. The next day,
we were all
set
to work in digging for the
foundation of a new wall, which was to
enlarge our
master
's gardens. The
weather
was
sultry
. The
soil
below the
surface
was
almost
a
quicksand
. I,
unused
to hard labour, found my
strength
soon
exhausted
. My fellow
slaves
,
compassionating
my
distress
, were anxious, by
changing places with me, to render my
share
of the labour
less
toilsome
. As we
had our
stint
for the whole party
staked
out to us every morning, it was in the
power of my kind fellow labourers to
favour
me much. Often would they
request
me, by
signs
, to
repose
myself
in the
shade
, while they encouraged each other
to perform my
share
of the
task
. After
a while, our
master
came to
inspect
the
work; and, conceiving that it did not
progress
as
fast
as he
wished
, he put an
overseer
over us, who, finding me not
so
active as the
rest
,
first
threatened and then
struck
me with his whip. This was the
first
disgraceful
blow I had ever received.
Judge you, my gallant, freeborn fellow
citizens, you, who rejoice daily in our
federal
strength
and independence, what
were my
sensations
. I threw down my
spade
with
disdain
, and retired from my
work, lowering indignation upon my
insulting
oppressor
. Upon his lifting his
whip to
strike
me again, I flew at him,
collared him, and threw him on his back.
Then,
setting
my foot on his
breast
, I
called upon my fellow
slaves
to
assist
me
to bind the wretch, and to make one
glorious
effort for our freedom. But I
called in vain. They could not
comprehend
my language; and, if they could,
I
spoke
to
slaves
,
astonished
at my
presumption
,
and dreading the
consequences
for me and
themselves
. After their
first
astonishment
, they ran and took me
gently
off from the
overseer
, and
raised
him
with the
greatest
respect
. No
sooner
was
he upon his feet than, mad with rage, he
took up a mattoc; and, with a violent
blow upon my head, levelled me to the
ground. I lay
senseless
, and was
awakened
from my
stupor
by the
severe
lashes
of his whip, with which the
dastardly
wretch continued to beat me, until his
strength
failed. I was then left to the
care of my fellow
slaves
, who could only
wash
my wounds with their tears.
Complaint
was immediately made to my
master
,
and I was
sent
to work in a
stone
Vol. II. D
quarry about two miles from the
house
.
At
first
, I rejoiced in
escaping
the malice
of this
merciless
overseer
, but
soon
found
I had made no advantageous exchange.
I was
surrounded
by the
most
miserable
objects. My fellow labourers had been
put to this place, as a
punishment
for
domestic
crimes, or for their
superiour
strength
,
and all were obliged to labour equally
hard. To break hard rocks with heavy
mauls, to
transport
large
stones
upon our
backs up the craggy
sides
of the quarry,
were our common labours; and to drink
water, which would have been delicious, if
cold, and to eat black barley bread and
onions, our daily fare; while the few
hours, allotted to
rest
upon our flinty
beds, were
disturbed
by the tormenting
insects
, or on my part by the more
tormenting
dreams of the dainties of my
father's
house
. There is a
spring
under a
rock upon my father's farm, which we
called the cold
spring
, from which we
used
to
supply
our family with water, and
prided
ourselves
in
presenting
it as a
refreshing
beverage, in
summer
, to our
visitors
.
How often, after working beyond
my
strength
, on a
sultry
African day, in
that horrid quarry, have I dreamed of
dipping my cup in that cold
spring
, and
fancied the waters eluding my
taste
as I
raised
it to my lips. Being
presented
with a tumbler filled from this
spring
,
after
my return, in a large circle of friends,
the agonies I had
suffered
came
so
forcibly
into my recollection, that I could not
drink the water, but had the
weakness
to
melt into tears.
How naturally did the emaciated
prodigal
,
in the
scripture
, think upon the
bread in his father's
house
. Bountiful
Father of the
Universe
, how are the
common
blessings
of thy providence
despised
.
When I ate of the bread of my father's
house
, and drank of his
refreshing
spring
,
no grateful return was made to him or
thee. It was
amidst
the parched
sands
and
flinty rocks of Africa that thou
taughtest
me, that the bread was indeed
pleasant
,
and the water
sweet
. Let
those
of our
fellow citizens, who
set
at nought the
rich
blessings
of our federal union, go like
me to a land of
slavery
, and they will then
learn how to appreciate the value of our
free government.
CHAP. V.
A
christian
is the
highest
stile
of man.
And is there, who the
blessed
cross
wipes off,
As a foul blot from his
dishonour
'd brow?
If angels tremble, 'tis at
such
a
sight
:
The wretch they quit,
desponding
of their charge,
More
struck
with grief or wonder, who can tell?

Argument.
The Author is encountered by a Renegado:
Struggles between Faith, the World, the
Flesh
, and the Devil
.
As I
was drooping under my
daily
task
, I
saw
a young man habited in
the
Turkish
dress
,
whose
clear
skin
and
florid cheek convinced me he was not a
native of the country;
whose
mild air
and manners betrayed nothing of the
ferocity
of the renegado. The
stile
of his
turban pronounced him a Mahometan;
but the look of pity, he
cast
towards the
D 2
christian
slaves
, was entirely
inconsistent
with the pious hauteur of the
mussulman
;
for
christian
dog is
expressed
as
strongly
by the features as the tongue of him, they
call a true believer. He
arrested
my
attention
.
For a moment I
suspended
my
labour
.
At the
same
moment, an
unmerciful
lash
, from the whip of the
slave
driver
,
recalled my attention to my work, and
excited his, who was the
cause
of my
neglect
.
At his approach, the
slave
driver
quitted me. The
stranger
accosted
me,
and in good
English
commisserated
my
distresses
, which, he
said
, he
should
deplore
the more, if they were
remediless
.
When a man is degraded to the
most
abject
slavery
,
lost
to his friends, neglected
by his country, and can anticipate no
rest
but in the grave, is not his
situation
remediless
,
I replied? Renounce the
Christian
,
and embrace the Mahometan faith;
you are no longer a
slave
, and the
delights
of life await you, retorted he. You
see
me. I am an
Englishman
. For
three years after my captivity, like you,
I groaned under the
lash
of the
slave
driver
;
I ate the
scanty
morsel
of
bitterness
,
moislened
with my tears. Borne down
by the complicated ills of hunger and
severe
labour, I was carried to the
infirmary
for
slaves
, to breathe my
last
, where I
was
visited
by a Mollah or Mahometan
priest
. He pitied the misfortunes of a
wretch, who, he
said
, had
suffered
a cruel
existence
, in this life, and had no rational
hopes of exchanging it for a better, in the
world to come. He opened the great truths
of the
mussulman
faith. By his
assistance
I
recovered my health, and was received
among
the faithful. Embraced and
protected
by the rich and powerful, I have now
a
house
in the city, a country
residence
on the Saffran, two beautiful wives, a
train of
domestics
; and a
respectable
place in the Dey's
customs
desrays
the
expense
. Come, added he, let me
send
my friend, the Mollah, to you. He will
remove your
scruples
, and, in a few days,
you will be as free and happy as I am.
I looked at him with
astonishment
. I
had ever viewed the character of an
apostate
as odious and
detestable
. I
turned
from him with abhorrence, and for
once embraced my burthen with
pleasure
.
Indeed I pity you,
said
he. I
sorrow
for your
distresses
, and pity your
prejudices
.
I pity you too, replied I, the tears
standing
in my eyes. My body is in
slavery
,
but my mind is free. Your body is at
liberty, but your
soul
is in the
most
abject
slavery
, in the gall of
bitterness
and bond
of iniquity. You have
sold
your God for
filthy lucre; and what
shall
it profit you,
if you gain the whole world and
lose
your
own
soul
, or what
shall
a man give in
exchange
for his
soul
. I
respect
your
prejudices
,
said
the
stranger
,
because
I have
been
subject
to them
myself
. I was born in
Birmingham in England, and educated a
rigid
dissenter
. No man is more
subject
to
prejudice than an
Englishman
, and no
sectary
more
obstinately
attached to his tenets
than the
dissenter
. But I have
conversed
with the Mollah, and I am convinced of
the errours of my education.
Converse
with him
likewise
. If he does not convince
you, you may glory in the
christian
faith;
as that faith will be then founded on
rational
preference, and not merely on your
ignorance of any other religious
system
.
Suggest
the
least
desire
to
converse
with
the Mollah, and an order from the Mufti
will come to your
master
. You will be
clothed and fed at the public
expense
;
be lodged one month in the college
of the
priest
; and not returned to your
labours, until the
priest
shall
declare you
incorrigible. He then left me. The
heat
increased
, and my
strength
wasted
.
The
prospect
of
some
alleviation
from labour, and perhaps a
curiosity
to
hear what could be
said
in favour of
so
detestably
ridiculous a
system
, as the
Mahometan
imposture
, induced me,
when I
saw
the
Englishman
again, to
signify
my
consent
to
converse
with the
Mollah.
CHAP. VI.

Argument.
The Author is carried to the
sacred
College
of the
Mussulman
Priest
: The
Mortifications
and
Austerities
of the Mahometan
Recluse
. The
Mussulman
mode of
Proelyting
.
The
next day, an order came
from the Mufti to my
master
, who
received
the order, touched his forehead with
the tefta
respectfully
, and directed me to
be
instantly
delivered to the Mollah. I
was carried to the college, a large gloomy
building, on the
outside
; but, within the
walls, it was an earthly
paradise
. The
stately
rooms,
refreshing
baths, cooling
fountains, luxuriant gardens, ample
larders
,
rich carpets, downy
sofas
, and
silken
mattresses
, offered with
profusion
all
those
soft
excitements to indolent
pleasure
, which the
most
refined
voluptuary
could
desire
. I have often
observed
that, in all countries, except
New England,
those
,
whose
profession
it is to decry the luxuries and vanities
of this world,
some
how or other,
contrive
to
possess
the
greatest
portion of
them.
Immediately upon my entering
these
sacred
walls, I was carried to a warm bath,
into which I was immediately plunged;
while my attendants, as if emulous to
cleanse
me from all the filth of errour,
rubbed
me
so
hard with their hands and
flesh
brushes
, that I verily thought they would
have flayed me. While I was relaxed
with the tepid, I was
suddenly
plunged
into a contiguous cold bath. I
confess
I
apprehended dangerous
consequences
,
from
so
sudden
a check of
such
violent
perspiration
; but I
arose
from the cold
bath highly invigorated.

[1]
The Indian of North America
surprised
the
European
physician
, by a
process
founded on
similar
principles. The patient, in the
most
violent
fever, was confined in a low hut, built of turf and
flat
stones
, which had been
previously
heated by
fire. When the
profusest
perspiration
was thus
excited, the patient was carried, and often, with
Indian fortitude, ran to the next
stream
, and
plunged frequently through the ice into the
coldest
water. This
process
, which Brhaave and
Sydenham would have pronounced deletery,
ever produced
pristine
health and vigour, when
prescribed
by the Indian
physician
or
Powwow
.
I was then
anointed
in all parts, which had been
exposed
to the
sun
with a preparation of a
gum, called the balm of Mecca. This
application
excited a very
uneasy
sensation
,
similar
to the
stroke
of the water pepper,
Vol. II. F
to which the liberal
shepherds
give a
grosser
name. In twenty four hours, the
sun
browned cuticle peeled off, and left my
face, hands, legs, and neck as fair as a child's
of
six
months old. This balm the Algerine
ladies procure at a great
expense
, and
use
it as a
cosmetic
to heighten their
beauty
.
After I had been clothed in the drawers,
slippers
,
loose
coat, and
shirt
of the country,
if
shirt
it could be called, which neck had
none; with a decoction of the herb
henna
,
my hands and feet were tinged
yellow
:
which colour, they
said
, denoted
purity of intention. I was lodged and
fed well, and
suffered
to
amuse
myself
,
and recover my
sanity
of body and mind.
On the eleventh day, as I was reclining
on the margin of a retired fountain,
reflecting
on my dear native country, I was
joined by the Mollah. He was a man
of about thirty years of age, of the
most
pleasing
countenance and engaging
deportment
.
He was born at Antioch, and
educated a
christian
of the Greek church.
He was
designed
by his parents for a
preferment
in that church, when he was
captured
by the Algerines, and
almost
immediately
,
conformed to the
mussulman
faith; and was in high
esteem
in the
sacred
college of the
priests
. As he
spoke
latin and
some
modern languages
fluently
,
was well
versed
in the bible and
christian
doctrines, he was often employed in
proselyting
the European
slaves
, and
prided
himself
in his frequent
success
.
He
accosted
me with the
sweetest
modulation
of voice; kindly inquired after
my welfare; begged to know if my
lodging
,
dress
, and fare, were agreeable;
assuring
me that, if I
wished
to alter either,
in
such
a manner as to bring them nearer
to the fare and modes of my native country,
and would give my directions, they
should
be obeyed. He
requested
me to appoint
a time, when we might
converse
upon the
great
subject
of religion. He
observed
that he
wished
me free from bodily
indisposition
,
and that the powers of my mind
would recover their activity. He
said
,
the holy faith, he offered to my embraces,
disdained
the
use
of other powers than
rational
argument; that he left to the church
of Rome, and its
merciless
inquisitors
, all
the honour and profit of
conversion
by
faggots, dungeons, and racks. He made
some
further inquiry, as to my
usage
in
the college, and retired. I had been
so
long
accustomed
to the
insolence
of
domestic
tyranny;
so
often groaned under
the whip and burthen;
so
often been
buffetted,
spurned
and
spit
upon, that I
had
steeled
my mind
against
the force and
terrour, I anticipated from the Mollah;
but was totally unprepared for
such
apparent
candour and
gentleness
. Though I
viewed his conduct as
insidious
, yet he
no
sooner
retired than, overcome by his
suavity
of manners, for the
first
time I
trembled for my faith, and
burst
into
tears.

Argument.
The Author confereth with a Mollah or
Mahometan
Priest
: Defendeth the Verity
of the
Christian
Creed, and
resigns
his
Body to Slavery, to
preserve
the Freedom
of his Mind
.
Upon
the margin of a
refreshing
fountain,
shadowed
by the fragrant
branches of the orange, date, and
pomegranate
,
for five
successive
days I
maintained
the
sacred
truths of our holy
religion
,
against
the
insidious
attack of the
mussulman
priest
. To be more
perspicuous
,
I have
condensed
our
conversation
,
and, to avoid
useless
repetition, have
assumed
the manner of a dialogue.
Mollah
. Born in New England, my
friend, you are a
christian
purified by
Calvin. Born in the Campania of Rome,
you had been a
papist
.
Nursed
by the
Hindoos, you would have entered the
pagoda with reverence, and
worshipped
the
soul
of your
ancestor
in a duck.
Educated on the bank of the Wolga the
Delai Lama had been your god. In
China
,
you would have
worshipped
Tien, and
perfumed Confucius, as you bowed in
adoration before the tablets of your
ancestors
.
Cradled with the
Parsees
of
Indostan
,
you had adored fire, and trembled
with pious awe, as you
presented
your rice
and your ghee to the adorable cock and dog.
A
wise
man adheres not to his religion,
because
it was that of his
ancestors
. He
will examine the creeds of other nations,
compare them with his own, and hold
fast
that, which is right.
Author
. You
speak
well. I will bring
my religion to the
test
. Compare it with
thethe
Mollah
. Speak out boldly. No
advantage
shall
be taken. You would
say
,
with the Mahometan
imposture
. To
determine
which of two revealed religions
is
best
, two inquiries are alone
necessary
.
First
, which of them has the
highest
proof
of its divine origin, and which inculcates
the
purest
morals: that is, of which have
we the
greatest
certainty that it came from
God, and which is calculated to do
most
good to mankind.
Author
. True. As to the
first
point,
our bible was written by men divinely
inspired
.
Mollah
. Our alcoran was written by
the finger of the Deity
himself
. But who
told you, your bible was written by men
divinely
inspired
.
Author
. We have received it from our
ancestors
, and we have as good evidence
for the truths it contains, as we have in
profane
history
for any
historical
fact.
Mollah
. And
so
have we for the
alcoran
.
Our
sacred
and profane writers all
prove the
existence
of
such
a prophet as
Mahomet, that he received the
sacred
volume
from the hand of Gabriel, and the
traditions of our
ancestors
confirm our
faith.
Author
. We know, the
christian
religion
is true, from its
small
beginnings and
wonderful
increase
. None but Deity
himself
could have enabled a few illiterate
fishermen
to
spread
a religion over the
world, and perpetuate it to
posterity
.
Mollah
. Your argument I allow to
be forcible, but grant us
also
the
use
of it.
Mahomet was an illiterate camel driver.
Could he, who could not read nor write,
have
published
a book, which for its
excellence
has
astonished
the world? Would
the learned of Medina and Mecca have
become his
disciples
? Could Omar and
Abubeker, his
successours
, equally illiterate,
have become the admiration of the world?
If you argue from the
astonishing
spread
of your faith, view our prophet, born five
hundred and
sixty
nine years, and dating
the promulgation of his doctrine
six
hundred
and twenty years after the birth of
your prophet. See the
extensive
countries
of
Persia
, Arabia, Syria, Egypt, all
rejoicing in its benign influence. See
our holy faith pouring its divine rays of
light into
Russia
, and Tartary. See it
received by enlightened Greece,
raising
its
crescent
through the
vast
Turkish
empire
,
and the African
states
. See
Palestine
,
and
Jerusalem
the birth place of
your prophet, filled with the
disciples
of
ours. See
Asia
and Africa, and a great
part of Europe acknowledging the unity
of God, and the
mission
of his prophet.
In a word, view the world. See two
mahometans
of a religion, which
arose
six
hundred and twenty years after yours, to one
christian
, computing
those
of all
denominations
,
and then give your argument of
the miraculous
spread
of religion its due
weight.
My blood boiled to hear this infidel
vaunt
himself
thus triumphantly
against
my faith; and, if it had not been for a
prudence, which in hours of zeal I have
since
had
cause
to lament, I
should
have
taken vengeance of him upon the
spot
. I
restrained
my anger, and
observed
, our
religion is
supported
by miracles.
Mollah
. So is ours; which is the
more remarkable, as our great prophet
declared
,
he was not
sent
into the world
to work miracles, but to preach the unity
of the
first
cause
, the
resurrection
of the
dead, the
bliss
of
paradise
, and the
torments
of the damned. Yet his whole life
was a miracle. He was no
sooner
born
than, with a voice, like the thundering of
Hermon, he pronounced the adorable
creed to his mother and
nurses
:
I
profess
that there is only one God, and that I am
his
apostle
. He was
circumcised
from all
eternity; and, at the
same
hour, a
voice of four mighty angels was heard
proclaiming from the four corners of the
holy
house
. The
first
saying
,proclaim
the truth is
risen
, and all lies
shall
return
into hell. The
second
uttering, now is
born an
apostle
of your own nation, and
the Omnipotent is with him. The words
of the third were,a book full of
illustrious
light is
sent
to you from God; and the
fourth voice was heard to
say
, O
Mahomet
,
we have
sent
thee to be a prophet,
apostle
, and guide to the world.
When the
sent
of God was about three
years old, the
blessed
child retired into a
cave, at the
basis
of mount Uriel; when
the archangel Gabriel, covering his face
with his wings, in awful
respect
approached
him
saying
,
Bismillahi
Rrahmani
Rrhahimi
;
in the name of the one Almighty,
Compassionate
, and Merciful, I am
sent
to
pluck from thy heart the root of evil; for
thy prayers have
shaken
the pillars of
eternal
decree. The infant prophet
said
,
the will of thy Lord and mine be done.
The archangel, then opened his
bosom
with a lancet of adamant, and, taking out
his heart,
squeezed
from it the black drop
of original
sin
; and, having
restored
the
heart,
sunk
gently into the
bosom
of the
Houri.
Do you
wish
for more miracles? Hear
how the prophet, in the dark night,
passsed
the
seven
heavens upon the
sacred
mule; of the mighty angel he
saw
, of
such
astonishing
magnitude, that it was twelve
thousand
days journey in the
space
between
his eye brows; of the years he
pent in
perusing
the book of
destiny
; and
how he returned,
so
speedily
that, the
mattress
was not cold, and he recovered
the pitcher at his bed
side
, which he had
overset
at his departure,
so
that not one
drop of water was
lost
.
Contrast
these
Vol. II. F
with
those
of your prophet. He then
vented a volume of reproach horrible to
hear, and too
blasphemous
to defile my
paper.
Author
. Our religion was
disseminated
in peace; yours was promulgated by the
sword
.
Mollab
. My friend, you
surely
have
not read the writings of your own
historians
.
The
history
of the
christian
church
is a detail of bloody
massacre
: from the
institution
of the
christian
thundering
legion
,
under
Constantine
the great, to the
expulsion
of the Moors out of Spain by
the ferocious
inquisition
, or the
dragooning
of the Hugonots from France, under
Louis the great. The
mussulmen
never
yet forced a man to adopt their faith.
When Abubeker, the caliph, took a
christian
city, he forbore to enter a principal
church, as he
should
pray in the temple
of God; and, where he prayed, the
building
would be
established
as a
mosque
by
the piety of the faithful. The
companions
and
successours
of the
apostle
conquered
cities and kingdoms, like other nations.
They gave civil laws to the conquered,
according to the laws of nations; but they
never forced the
conscience
of any
man. It is true, they then and we now,
when a
slave
pronounces the ineffable
creed, immediately knock off his
fetters
and receive him as a brother;
because
we read in the book of Zuni that
the
souls
of true believers are bound up in
one fragrant bundle of eternal love. We
leave it to the
christians
of the
West
Indies
,
and
christians
of your
southern
plantations
,
to baptize the unfortunate
African
into your faith, and then
use
your
brother
christians
as brutes of the
desert
.
Here I was
so
abashed
for my country,
I could not
answer
him.
Author
. But you hold a
sensual
paradise
Mollab
. So the doctors of your church
tell you; but a
sensual
heaven is no more
imputable to us than to you. When the
Most
Holy
condescends
to reveal
himself
to man in human language, it
must
be in terms
commensurate
with our
conception
.
The enjoyment of the Houri,
those
immortal virgins, who will attend
the beatified believer; the
splendid
pavilions
of the heavens, are all but types
and
significations
of holy joys too
sublime
for man in
flesh
to conceive of. In
your bible, I read, your prophet refers to
the time, when he
should
drink new wine
in his father's kingdom. Now would it
be candid in me to
hastily
brand the
heaven
of your prophet as
sensual
, and to
represent
your faithful in blils as a club of
wine bibbers?
Author
. But you will allow the
preeminence
of the morality of the
sacied
scriptures
.
Mollab
. Your
scriptures
contain many
excellent rules of life. You are there
taught to be kindly affectionate one
towards
another; but they recommend the
use
of wine, and do not forbid gaming.
The alcoran, by forbidding in
express
terms the
use
of either, cuts from its
follower
the two principal
sources
of
disquiet
and
misery
. Read then this
spotless
book. There you will learn to love
those
of
our faith, and not hate
those
of any other.
You will learn the
necessity
of being
virtuous
here, that you may be happy and not
miserable
hereafter. You will learn
refignation
to the will of the Holy One;
because
you will know, that all the events
of your life were, in the embryo of time,
forged on the anvils of Divine
Wisdom
.
In a word, you will learn the unity of
God, which,
notwithstanding
the cavil of
your divines, your prophet, like ours, came
into the world to
establish
, and every man
of
reason
must
believe. You need not
renounce your prophet. Him we
respect
F 2
as a great
apostle
of God; but
Mahomet
is the
seal
of the prophets. Turn
then, my friend, from
slavery
to the
delights
of life. Throw off the
shackles
of
education from your
soul
, and be
welcome
to the joys of the true believer.
List
your finger to the
immensity
of
space
,
and
consess
that there is one God, and
that Mahomet is his
apostle
.
I have thus given a few
sketches
of the
manner of this artful
priest
. After five
days
conversation
,
disgusted
with his
fables
,
abashed
by his
assurance
, and
almost
confounded by his
sophistry
. I
resumed
my
slave
's attire, and
sought
safety
in my
former
servitude
.

Argument.
The Language of the Algerines
.
The
very day, I was
dismissed
from the college of the
priests
, I was
returned
to my
master
, and the next
morning
sent
again to labour in the quarry.
To my
surprise
, no
harsh
reflections were
made upon, what
these
true believers
must
have
stiled
, my
obstinate
prejudice
against
the true faith; for I am
fensible
that my
master
was
so
good a
mussulman
as to
have rejoiced in my
conversion
, though
it might affect his
purse
. I experienced
the
extremest
contumely and
severity
;
but I was never branded as a heretic. I
had by this time acquired
some
knowledge
of their language, if language it could
be called, which bad defiance to modes
and
tenses
, appearing to be the
shreds
and clippings of all the tongues, dead and
living, ever
spoken
since
the creation.
It is well known on the
sea
coasts
of the
Mediterranean by the name of
Lingua
Franca
. Probably it had its
rise
in the
awkward endeavours of the natives to
converse
with
strangers
from all parts of
the world, and the vulgar people, calling
all foreigners
Franks
,
supplied
its
name
.
I the more readily acquired this jargon, as
it contained many Latin derivatives. If I
have conjectured the principle, upon
which the
Lingua Franca
was originally
formed, it is applied through all
stages
of
its
existence
: every
person
having good
right to introduce words and
phrases
from
his vernacular tongue, and which, with
some
alteration in accent, are readily
adopted
.
[2]
[2]
I well recollect, being once at a
loss
to name
a
composition
of boiled barley, rice and treacle, I
called for the HASTY PUDDING and MOLASSES.
The
phrase
was immediately adopted, and HASCHI
PUDAH MOLASCHI is now a
synonima
with the
ancient name: and, I doubt not, if a dictionary
of the Lingue Franca
shall
ever be compiled, the
name of the
staple
cookery of New England will
have a
conspicucus
place.
This medley of
sounds
is generally
spoken
, but the people of the higher
rank pride
themselves
in
speaking
pure
Arabic. My conference with the
Mollah
was effected in Latin, which the
priest
pronounced very differently from the
learned
president
and
professors
of
Harvard
college, but delivered
himself
with
fluency and elegance.

Argument.
The Author plans an
Escape
.
I found
many more
slaves
at work in the
stone
quarry, than when I
quitted it; and the labours and hard fare
seemed
, if
possible
, to be augmented. The
ease
and comfort, with which I lived for
some
weeks
past
, had vitiated my appetite,
softened
my hands, and relaxed my whole
frame,
so
that my
coarse
fare and rugged
labours
seemed
more
insupportable
. I
nauseated
our homely food, and the
skin
peeled from my hands and
shoulders
.
I made what inquiries I could, as to the
interiour geography of the country, and
comforted
myself
with theh ope of
escape
;
conceiving it, under my
desperate
circumstances
,
possible
to penetrate
unobserved
the interiour country, by the
eastern
boundaries of the kingdom of Morocco,
and then
pass
on
south
west
, until I
struck
the river Sanaga, and
coursing
that to its
mouth I knew would bring me to
some
of the European
settlements
near Goree or
Cape Verd. Preparatory to my
intended
escape
I had procured an old goat's
skin
, which to make into
something
like a
knapsack
, I deprived
myself
of many
hours of
necessary
sleep
; and of many a
scanty
meal to fill it with
provisions
. By
the
use
of my Lingua Franca and a
little
Arabic, I hoped to obtain the
assistance
of the
slaves
and lower orders of the
people, through whom I might journey.
The only
insurmountable
difficulty in my
projects was to elude the vigilance of our
overseers
. By a kind of roll call the
slaves
were numbered every night and morning,
and at meal times: but, very
fortunately
,
a probable opportunity of
escaping
unnoticed
soon
offered. It was announced
to the
slaves
that in three days time there
would be a day of
rest
, a holiday, when
they would be allowed to recreate
themselves
in the fields. This intelligence
diffused
general joy. I received it with
rapture. I doubled my diligence in my
preparations; and, in the afternoon
previous
to this fortunate day, I contrived
to place my little
stock
of
provisions
under
a rock at a
small
distance
from the quarry.
At
sunset
we were all admitted to bathe,
and I retired to my
repose
with bright hopes
of freedom in my heart, which were
succeeded
by the
most
pleasing
dreams of my
native land. That Beneficent Being, who
brightens the
slumbers
of the wretched
with rays of
bliss
, can alone
express
my
raptures, when, in the
visions
of that night,
I
stepped
lightly over a father's
threshhold
;
was
surrounded
by congratulating
friends and faithful
domestics
; was
pressed
by the embraces of a father; and with
holy joy felt a mother's tears
moisten
my
cheek.
Early in the dawn of the morning, I
was awakened by the congratulations of
my fellows, who immediately collected in
small
groups, planning out the intended
amusements
of the day. Scarce had
they portioned the little
space
alloted to
ease
, according their various inclinations,
when an
express
order came from our
Vol. II. G
master
that we
should
go under the
immediate
direction of our
overseers
,
to a plain, about five miles
distance
,
to be
present
at a publick
spectacle
. This
was a grievous
disappointment
to them,
and more
especially
to me. I buoyed up
my
spirits
however with the hopes that, in
the hurry and crowd, I might find means
to
escape
, which, although I knew I could
not return for my
knapsack
, I was
resolved
to attempt, having a little millet and two
onions in my pocket.

Argument.
The Author
present
at a Public
Spectacle
.
We
were
soon
paraded and
marched to the plain, to be
amused
with
the
promised
spectacle
, which,
notwithstanding
it might probably
frustrate
my
attempts for freedom, I anticipated with
a
pleasing
curiosity
. When we arrived
at the plain, we found,
surrounding
a
spot
,
fenced in with a
slight
railing, a large
concourse
of people, among whom I could
discern
many groups of men,
whose
habits
and
sorrow
indented faces
shewed
them
to be of the
same
miserable
order with us.
In the
midst
of this
spot
there was a frame
erected,
somewhat
resembling
the
stage
of
our pillories; on the centre of which a
pole or
strong
stake
was erected,
sharpened
at the end and pointed with
steel
. While
I was perplexing
myself
with the
design
of this apparatus, military
music
was
heard at a
distance
; and
soon
after a
strong
party of guards approached the
seaffold
and
soon
mounted upon the
stage
a
miserable
wretch, with all the agonies of
despair
in his countenance, who I learned
from his
sentence
, proclaimed by a
public
crier, was to be impailed alive for
attempting
to
escape
from bondage. The
consciousness
that I had been, one
moment
before, meditating the
same
act, for
which this wretch was to
suffer
so
cruelly
,
added to my feelings for a fellow
creature
,
excited
so
strong
a
sympathy
for
the devoted wretch, that I was near
fainting
.
I will not wound the
sensibility
of my
humane fellow citizens, by a minute
detail
of this fiend like
punishment
.
Suffice
it to
say
that, after they had
stripped
the
sufferer
naked, except a cloth around
the loins, they
inserted
the iron pointed
stake
into the lower termination of the
vertebr, and thence forced it up near his
back bone, until it appeared between his
shoulders
; with
devilish
ingenuity
contriving
to avoid the vital parts. The
stake
was then
raised
into the air, and the
suffering
wretch
exposed
to the view of the
assembly
, writhing in all the contortions
of
insupportable
agony. How long he
lived, I cannot tell, I never gave but one
look at him: one was enough to appal
a New England heart. I laid my head
on the rails, until we retired. It was
now obvious, it was
designed
by our
master
, that this horrid
spectacle
should
operate upon us as a terrifying example.
It had its full effect on me. I thought
no more of attempting an
escape
; but,
during our return, was
miserably
tormented
G 2
least
my
knapsack
and
provisions
should
be found and adduced
against
me,
as evidence of my intent to
desert
.
Happily
for me, I recovered them the next
day, and no
suspicions
of my
design
were
entertained.

Argument.
The Author feels that he is indeed a Slave
.
I now
found that I was
indeed
a
slave
. My body had been
enthralled
,
but the dignity of a free mind
remained; and the
same
insulted
pride,
which had impelled me to
spurn
the
villain
slave
driver, who
first
struck
me a
disgraceful
blow, had often excited a
surly
look of contempt upon my
master
, and
the vile
instruments
of his
oppression
;
but the terrour of the late execution, with
the unabating fatigue of my body, had
so
depressed
my fortitude, that I trembled at
the look of the
overseer
, and was meanly
anxious to conciliate his favour, by
attempting
personal
exertions beyond my
ability. The trite
story
of the
insurgent
army of the
slaves
of ancient Rome,
being
routed by the mere menaces and
whips of their
masters
, which I ever
sceptically
received, I now credit. A
slave
myself
, I have learned to appreciate the
blessings
of freedom. May my
countrymen
ever
preserve
and
transmit
to their
posterity
that liberty, which they have
bled to obtain; and always bear it
deeply
engraven upon their memories, that,
when men are once reduced to
slavery
,
they can never
resolve
, much more
achieve, any thing, that is manly,
virtuous
,
or great.
Depression
of
spirits
,
consequent
upon
my
blasted
hope of
escape
,
coarse
fare,
and
constant
fatigue reduced me to a mere
skeleton
: while over exertion brought on
an h
moptysis
or expectoration of blood,
and menaced an approaching hectic;
and
soon
after, fainting under my
burthen
,
I was taken up and conveyed in a
horse
litter to the infirmary for
slaves
, in
the city of Algiers.

Argument.
The Infirmary
.
Here
I was lodged
comfortably
,
and had all the attention paid me,
which good
nurses
and ignorant
physicians
could render. The former were
men, who had made a vow of poverty,
and
whose
prosession
was to attend the
couches of the
sick
; the latter were more
ignorant than
those
of my own country,
who had
amused
me in the gayer days of
life. They had no theory nor any
systematic
practice; but it was immaterial to me.
I had
cast
my
last
anxious thoughts upon
my dear native land, had
blessed
my
affectionate
parents, and was
resigned
to
die.
One day as I was
sunk
upon my bed,
after a violent fit of coughing, I was
awakened
from a doze, by a familiar voice,
which
accosted
me in Latin. I opened
my eyes and
saw
at my
side
, the
Mollah
,
who attempted to
destroy
my faith.
It immediately
struck
me that his
purpose
was to tempt me to
apostatize
in my
last
moments. The religion of my country
was all I had left of the many
blessings
, I
once enjoyed, in common with my fellow
citizens. This rendered it doubly dear
to me. Not that I was
insensible
of the
excellence and verity of my faith; no. If
I had been
exposed
to
severer
agonies than
I
suffered
, and had been flattered with all
the riches and honours,
these
infidels could
bestow
, I
trust
I
should
never have foregone
that faith, which
assured
me for the
miseries
,
I
sustained
in a cruel
separation
from
my parents, friends, and intolerable
slavery
,
a rich
compensation
in that future world,
where I
should
rejoin my beloved
friends, and where
sorrow
,
misery
, or
slavery
,
should
never come. I judged
uncandidly of the
priest
. He
accosted
me with the
same
gentleness
, as when at
the college,
commiserated
my deplorable
situation
, and, upon my
expressing
an
aversion
to talk upon religion, he
assured
me that he
disdained
taking any
advantage
of my
weakness
; nor would attempt
to deprive me of the
consolation
of my
faith, when he feared I had no time left
to ground me in a better. He
recommended
me to the particular care of the
religious, who attended the
sick
in the
hospital
;
and, having learned in our former
conferences that I was educated a
physician
,
he influenced his friend the
director
of the infirmary to
purchase
me, if I
regained my health, and told him I would
be
serviceable
, as a minor
assistant
. If
any man could have effected a change of
my religion, it was this
priest
. I was
charmed with the man, though I
abominated
his faith. His very
smile
exhilerated
my
spirits
and
infused
health; and,
when he repeated his
visits
, and
communicated
his plan of alleviating my
distresses
,
the very idea, of being freed from the
oppressions
of Abdel Melic, made an
exchange
of
slavery
appear
desirable
. I
was again attached to life, and
requested
him to procure a
small
quantity of the
quinquina or
jesuits
bark. This
excellent
specific
was unknown in the
infirmary
;
but, as the Algerines are all
fatalists
,
it is immaterial to the patient, who is his
physician
, and what he
prescribes
. By
his
kindness
the bark was procured, and
I made a decoction, as near to Huxham's,
as the ingredients I could procure would
admit, which I
infused
in wine; no
brandy
being allowed, even for the
sick
. In a
few weeks, the
diagnostics
were
favourable
,

and I recovered my
pristine
health;
and,
soon
after, the director of the

me of my late

I was appointed to the care of the

permission
to go into the
city for
fresh
supplies

The Author's Practice as a Surgeon and
Physician
, in the City of Algiers
.
My
circumstances
were now
so
greatly ameliorated that, if I could have
been
assured
of returning to my native
country in a few years, I
should
have
esteemed
them eligible. To
observe
the
customs
, habits, and manners of a people,
of whom
so
much is
said
and
so
little
known at home; and
especially
to notice
the medical practice of a nation,
whose
ancestors
have been
spoken
of with
respect
,
in the annals of the healing art, was
highly
interesting
.
After a marked and
assiduous
attention
of
some
months to the duties of my
office, I acquired the confidence of my
superiours
so
far, that I was
sometimes
sent
abroad in the city to examine a
patient
,
who had applied for
admission
into
the infirmary; and
sometimes
the
physicians
themselves
would
condescend
to
consult
me. Though they affected to
despise
my
skill
, I had often the
gratification
of
observing
that they
administered
my
prescriptions
with
success
.
In
surgery
they were arrant bunglers.
Indeed, their
pretensions
to knowledge in
this branch were
so
small
that my
superiour
adroitness
scarce
occasioned
envy.
Applications
,
vulgarly common in the
United
States, were there viewed with
admiration
.
The actual cautery was their only
method of
staunching
an external
hemorrhage
.
The
first
amputation, I operated,
drew all the principal
physicians
around
me. Nothing could equal their
surprize
,
at the application of the
spring
tourniquet
,
which I had
assisted
a workman to
make for the
occasion
, except the taking
up of the arteries. My friend the Mollah
came to congratulate me on my
success
,
and
spread
my reputation wherever he
visited
. A poor creature was brought to
the
hospital
with a
depressed
fracture
upon
the os frontis,
sunk
into a lethargy,
and died. I
proposed
trepanning, but
found
those
useful
instruments
unknown
in this country. By the care of the
director
,
I had a
set
made under my
direction
;
but, after having performed upon a
dead, I never could
persuade
the
Algerine
faculty to permit me to opperate
upon
a living
subject
. What was more
amusing
,
they pretended to improve the
aid of
philosophy
against
me, and talked
of the weight of a column of air
pressing
upon the dura mater, which, they
said
, would
cause
instant
death. Of all
follies the foppery of learning is the
most
H 2
insupportable
.
Professional
ignorance
and
obstinacy
were not all I had to
contend
with. Religious prejudice was a
constant
impediment to my
success
. The
bigotry of the Mahometan differs
effentially
from that of the Roman catholic.
The former is a
passive
, the latter an
active
principle. The
papist
will burn
infidels and heretics; the
Mussulman
never torments the unbeliever, but is more
tenaciously
attached to his own creed,
makes his faith a principle in life, and
never
suffers
doubt to
disturb
, or
reason
to overthrow it. I verily believe that, if
the alcoran had declared, that the earth
was an
immense
plain and
stood
still
,
while the
sun
performed its revolution
round it, a whole
host
of Gallileos, with
a Newton at their head, could not have
shaken
their opinion, though aided by all
the
demonstrative
powers of
experimental
philosophy
.
I was invited by one of the faculty to
inspect
the eyes of a child, which had
lost
its
sight
about three years; I
proposed
couching, and operated on the right eye
with
success
. This child was the only
son
of an opulent Algerine, who, being
informed
that an infidel had
restored
his
son
to
sight
,
refused
to let me operate on the
other,
protesting
that, if he had known
that the operator was an unbeliever, his
son
should
have remained blind, until he
opened his eyes upon the Houri of
paradise
.
He
sent
me however a
present
of
money, and offered to make my fortune,
if I would abjure the
christian
faith and
embrace
Ismaelism
, which, he
said
, he
believed, I
should
one day do: as he
thought that God never would have
decreed
that I
should
restore
his
son
to
sight
, if he had not
also
decreed that I
should
be a true believer.

Visits
a
sick
Lady
.
My
reputation
increased
, and
I was called the learned
slave
; and,
soon
after,
sent
for to
visit
a
sick
lady. This
was very agreeable to me; for, during my
whole captivity, I had never yet
seen
the
face of a woman; even the female
children
being carefully concealed, at
least
from the
sight
of the vulgar. I now
anticipated
much
satisfaction
from this
visit
, and hoped that, through the
confidence
,
with which a tender and
successful
physician
seldom
fails to
inspire
his
patient, I
should
be able to acquire much
useful
information upon
subjects
of
domestic
concern, impervious to travellers.
Preparatory to this
visit
, I had received a
new and better
suit
of clothes than I had
worn, as a
present
from the father of the
young lady. A gilt waggon came to the
gate of the
hospital
, which I entered
with our principal
physician
, and was
drawn by mules to a country
house
,
about
five miles from the city, where I
was received by Hadgi Mulladin, the
father
of my patient, with great civility.
Real gentlemen are the
same
in all
countries
.
He treated us with fruit and
sherbet
;
and,
smiling
upon me, after he had
presented
a bowl of
sherbet
to the
principal
physician
, he handed me another
bowl, which to my
surprise
I found
filled
with an excellent Greek wine, and
archly inquired of me how I liked the
sherbet
. Hadgi Mulladin had
travelled
in his youth, and was
supposed
to
have imbibed the libertine principles of
the
christian
, as it
respected
wine. This
was the only
instance
, which came to my
knowledge, of any
professed
Mussulman
indulging
himself
with wine or any
strong
liquor; and it was not unnoticed by the
principal
physician
, who afterwards
gravely
told me that Hadgi Mulladin would be
undoubtedly damned for drinking wine;
would be condemned to perpetual
thirst
in the next world, while the black
spirit
would
present
him with red hot cups of
scalding
wine. Exhilirated by the wine
and the comparitively free manners of
this Algerine, I was anxious to
see
my
patient. I was
soon
gratified. Being
introduced
into a large room, I was left
alone
nigh an hour. A
side
door was
then opened, and two eunuchs came
forward
with much
solemnity
and made
signs
for me to retire to the
farthest
part
of the room, as if I had been
infested
with
some
malignant
disorder
. They were, in
about ten minutes, followed by four more
of the
same
sex
, bearing a
species
of couch,
close
covered with double curtains of
silk
, which they
set
down in the
midst
of
the room; and every one drew a broad
scimitar
from his belt,
flourishing
it in
the air, inclined it over his
shoulder
, and
stood
guard at every corner of the couch.
While I was wondering at this parade,
the two
first
eunuchs retired and
soon
returned
;
the one bearing an ewer or
bason
of water, the other a low marble
stand
,
and
some
napkins in a China
dish
. I was
then directed to
wash
my feet; and,
another
bason
being produced, it was
signified
that I
must
wash
my hands, which I
did three times. A large thick
muslin
veil was then thrown over my head, I was
led towards the couch, and was
presented
with a
pulse
glass
, being a long
glass
tube graduated and terminated
below
with a hollow bulb, and filled with
some
liquid, which
rose
and fell like
spirits
in the thermometer. This
instrument
was
inserted
through the curtains, and
the bulb applied to the
pulse
of my
patient, and the other extremity put
under
my veil. By this I was to form my
opinion of her
disorder
, and
prescribe
a
remedy; for I was not allowed to
ask
any
questions
or even to
speak
to, much more
see
the lady, who was
soon
reconveyed to
her apartment. The two
first
eunuchs
now marched in the rear, and
closed
and
fastened
the doors carefully after them.
After waiting alone two hours or more, I
was called to give my advice; and never
was I more puzzled. To
confess
ignorance
would have ruined my reputation,
and reputation was then life
itself
. The
temptations to quackery were powerful
and overcame me. I boldly pronounced
her
disease
to be an intermittent fever,
prescribed
venesection
, and exhibited
some
common febrifuge, with directions to
throw in the bark, when the fever
ceased
.
My
prescriptions
were attended with
admirable
success
; and, if I had conformed
to their faith, beyond a doubt, I might
have acquired
immense
riches. But I
was a
slave
, and all my gains were the
property of my
master
. I
must
do him
the
justice
to
say
that, he permitted me to
keep any particular
presents
, that were
made to me. Frequent applications
were made to the director for my advice
and
assistance
to the
diseased
; and, though
he received generally my fee, yet it was
sufficiently
gratifiying to me to be
permitted
to walk abroad, to
amuse
myself
, and
obtain information of this extraordinary
people, as much of which, as the
prescribed
limits of this little work will admit, I
shall
now lay before my readers.

Sketch of the
History
of the Algerines
.
Much
antiquarian lore might
here be
displayed
, in determining
whether
the
state
of Algiers was part of the
ancient Mauritinia
Massilia
, or within
the boundaries of the republic of
Carthage
;
and pages of
fruitless
research
might
be
wasted
, in
precisely
ascertaining
the
era, when that portion of the
sea
coast
of Af
rica, now generally known by the name
of the Barbary
[3]
[3]
Bruce, an
Englishman
, who travelled to
collect
fairy tales for the
amusement
of London cits,
observes
that this territory was called
Barbaria
by
the Greeks and Romans from
Beber
,
signifying
a
shepherd
; and even the accurate compiler of the
American edition of Guthrie's Geography has
quoted the
observation
in a marginal note. We
cannot
expect that geographers
should
be
philologists
anymore than that every printer
should
be a
Webster
.
How the Greeks or Romans came by the word
Beber
, I leave Mr. Bruce to elucidate. The
former
had the term
barbaros
, a barbarian, which they
indiscriminately
applied to all foreigners; and,
when Greek literature became
fashionable
in
Roman
schools
, the latter adopted the term, and
barbarus
was applied by the Romans with the
same
soppish
contempt.
Shore, was
subdued
by the
Romans, or conquered by the Vandals.
The
history
of nations, like the
biography
of man, only
assumes
an
interesting
importance, when its
subject
is matured
into vigour. To trace the infancy of the
old world, we run into
childish
prattle and
boyish
tales. Suffice it then to
say
, that
the mixed multitudes, which inhabited this
country, were reduced to the
subjection
of the Greek emperours by the arms of the
celebrated
Belisarius
, and
so
continued,
until the
close
of the
seventh
century,
when they were
subdued
by the
invincible
power, and converted to the creed of
the ancient caliphs, the immediate
successours
of the prophet Mahomet, who
parcelled the country into many
subordinate
governments, among which was that
of Algiers; which is now bounded, on
the north, by the Mediterranean; on the
south
, by mount Atlas,
so
familiar to the
classic
reader, and the chain of hills, which
extends thence to the north
east
; on the
west
, by the kingdom of Morocco;
[4]
[4]
The common geography compilers add the
kingdom of Tefilet, I conjecture, upon the
authority
of Dr. Shaw, though I could never hear
of any
such
kingdom in Africa. The face of
many a country, which that learned writer
describes
,
differs as much from the truth, as his own
physiognomy
from the true line of beauty.
and,
on the
east
, by the
state
of Tunis. The
state
of Algiers is about five hundred
miles in length, upon the
coast
of the
Mediterranean, and from fifty to one
hundred and twenty miles in breadth, and
boasts
about as large an extent of
territory
,
as is contained in all the United States
proper, which lay to the north of
Pennsylvania
including the
same
.
It was nine hundred years after the
conquest
of the caliphs, and at the
beginning
of the tenth century, that the
Algerines
,
by becoming formidable to the
Europeans
,
acquired the notice of the
enlightened
historian
. About this time, two
enterprizing young men,
sons
of a potter,
of the
island
of Mytelene the ancient
Lesbos
,
I 2
called Horric and Hayraddin,
collecting
a number of
desperadoes
,
seized
upon
a brigantine and commenced pirates,
making
indiscriminate
depredations upon
the
vessels
of all nations. They
soon
augmented their force to a fleet of twelve
gallies,
beside
small
craft, with which they
infested
the
sea
coast
of Spain and Italy,
and carried their booty into the ports of
Barbary,
styling
themselves
the lords of
the
sea
, and the enemies of all
those
, who
failed upon it. European nations were
not then
possessed
of
such
established
and
formidable navies, as at the
present
day:
even the
English
, who
seem
formed for the
command of the
sea
, had but few
ships
of
force. Henry the eighth built
some
vessels
,
which, from their unmanageable bulk,
were rather
suited
for home defence
than foreign enterprize; and the fleet of
Elizabeth, which, in fifteen hundred and
eighty eight,
destroyed
the
Spanish
Armada
,
was principally formed of
ships
,
chartered by the merchants, who were the
general
resource
of all the maratime
powers
.
The fleet of
these
adventurers was
therefore formidable; and, as
Robertson
says
,
soon
became terrible from the
straits
of the Dardanelles to
those
of Gibralter.
The
prospects
of ambition
increase
, as
man
ascends
its
summit
. Horric, the
elder brother,
surnamed
Barbarossa
, as
some
assert
, from the red colour of his
beard,
aspired
to the attainment of
sovereign
power upon land; and a favourable
opportunity
soon
offered of gratifying his
pride. His frequent
intercourse
with the
Barbary States induced an acquaintance
with Eutimi, then king of Algiers, who
was then at war with Spain, and had made
several
unsuccessful
attacks upon a
small
fort, built by that nation on the Oran. In
his
distress
, this king
inconsiderately
applied
to
Barbarossa
, for
assistance
, who
readily embraced the invitation, and
conducted
himself
like more modern allies.
He
first
assisted
this weak king
against
his
enemy, and then
sacrificed
him to his own
ambition; for, leaving his brother
Hayraddin
to command the fleet, he entered
the city of Algiers, at the head of five
thousand
men, was received by the
inhabitants
,
as their deliverer,
assisted
them
against
the Spaniards, and then
arrested
and
disarmed
the principal people,
secretly
murdered the
unsuspecting
Eutimi, and
caused
himself
to be proclaimed king of
Algiers.
Lavish
of his
treasures
to his
adherents, and cruelly vindictive to
those
, he
distrusted
, he not only
established
his government, but dethroned the
neighbouring king of Temecien, and
annexed
his dominions to his own. But
the brave Marquis de Comeres, the
Spanish
governour of Oran, by the direction
of the Emperour Charles the fifth,
assisted
the dethroned king; and, after defeating
Barbarossa
in
several
bloody battles,
besieged
him in Temecien, the capital of
that kingdom, where this ferocious
adventurer
was
slain
in attempting his
escape
,
but fought his
pursuers
with a
brutal
rage, becoming the ferocity of his life.
Upon the death of
Barbarossa
, his
brother
Hayraddin
assumed
the
same
name,
and the kingdom of Algiers. This
Barbarossa
is better known to the European
annalist
for rendering his dominions
tributary
to the Grand Seignior. He
enlarged
his power with a body of the
Turkish
soldiers
; and, being promoted to the
command of the
Turkish
fleet, he
spread
the fame of the Ottoman power through
all Europe: for though obliged by the
superiour
power of the Emperour Charles
fifth to
relinquish
his
conquest
of Tunis,
which he had effected by a
similar
treachery
,
with which his brother had
possessed
himself
of Algiers; yet his being the
acknowledged rival of Andrew Doria,
the
first
sea
commander of his age, has
laurelled his brow among
those
, who
esteem
glory to
consist
in carnage. This
Barbarossa
built a mole for the protection
of the harbour of Algiers, in which, it is
said
, he employed thirty
thousand
christian
slaves
, and died a natural death, and
was
succeeded
by
Hassan
Aga, a
renegado
from Sardinia, elected by the
soldiers
,
but confirmed by the Grand Seignior,
who, taking an advantage of a violent
strom
, which wrecked the navy of the
Emperour Charles fifth, who had invaded
his territories, drove that proud emperour
from the
coast
, defeated the rear of his
army, and captured
so
many of his
soldiers
,
that the Algerines, it is reported,
sold
many of their
prisoners
by way of
contempt, at the price of an onion per
head. Another
Hassan
,
son
to the
second
Barbarossa
,
succeeded
and defeated
the Spaniards, who invaded his
dominions
under the command of the Count de
Alcandara, killed that nobleman, and
took above twelve
thousand
prisoners
.
But his
successour
, Mahomet, merited the
most
of his country, when, by
ingratiating
himself
with the
Turkish
soldiers
, by
incorporating them with his own troops,
he annihilated the
contests
of
these
fierce
rivals, formed a permanent body of brave,
disciplined
troops, and enabled his
successour
to renounce that dependence upon
the Grand Seignior, to which the
second
Barbarossa
had
submitted
.
In
sixteen
hundred and nine, the
Algerines
received a
vast
accession
of
strength
and numbers from the emigrant Moors,
whom the weak policy of Spain had
driven
to their dominions. Embittered by
christian
severity
, the Moors flocked on
board the Algerine
vessels
, and
sought
a
desperate
revenge upon all, who bore
the
christian
name. Their fleet was
said
to
consist
, at this period, of upwards of
forty
ships
, from two to four hundred
tons burthen. Though the French with
that gallantry, which
distinguished
them
under their monarchs, undertook to
avenge
the
cause
of Europe and
christianity
;
and, in
sixteen
hundred and
seventeen
,
sent
a fleet of fifty
ships
of war
against
them, who
sunk
the Algerine
admiral
and
dispersed
his fleet; yet this
bold people were
so
elated, by their
accession
of numbers and riches, that they
committed wanton and
indiscriminate
outrage, on the
person
and property of all
nations, violating the treaties made by
the Grand Seignior,
seizing
the
ships
of
those
powers, with which he was in
alliance
,
even in his own ports; and, after
plundering Scandaroon in Syria, an
Ottoman
city, they, in
sixteen
hundred and
twenty three, threw off their
dependence
on the
sublime
Porte. In
sixteen
hundred and thirty
seven
, the Algerine
rovers entered the
British
channel, and
made
so
many captures that, it was
conjectured
,
near five
thousand
English
were
made
prisoners
by them; and, in the
same
year, they
dispatched
Hali
Pinchinin
with
sixteen
gallies to rob the rich
chapel of our lady of Loretto; which
proving
unsuccessful
, they ravaged the
shores
of the Adriatic, and
so
enraged the
Venetians
,
that they fitted out a fleet of
twenty eight fail, under the command of
Admiral Cappello, who, by a late treaty
with the Porte, had liberty to enter any of
its harbours, to
destroy
the Algerine
gallies
.
Cappello was ordered by the
Venetians
to
sink
, burn, and
destroy
, without
mercy, all the
corsairs
of the enemy, and
he bravely and
successfully
executed his
commission
. He immediately overtook
and defeated Pinchinin,
disabled
five of
his gallies; and, this Algerine
retreating
to Valona and landing his booty,
where he erected batteries for its defence,
the brave Cappello manned his boats
and
small
craft, and captured his whole
fleet. In
these
actions, about twelve
hundred
Algerines were
stain
; and, what
Vol. II. K
was more
pleasing
,
sixteen
hundred
christian
galley
slaves
set
at liberty.
History
affords no
instance
of a people,
so
repeatedly
and
suddenly
recovering their
losses
,
as the Algerines. Within a few
years, we find them fitting out
seventy
sail
of armed
vessels
, and making
such
daring and
desperate
attacks upon the
commerce of nations, that the
most
haughty
maritime powers of Europe were more
anxious, to
shelter
themselves
under a
treaty and pay an humiliating tribute,
than to attempt nobly to reduce them to
reason
and humanity. But, after many
ineffectual attempts had been made to
unite the force of Europe
against
them,
the gallant French, by the command of
Louis fourteenth, again
roused
themselves
to
chasten
this intractable race. In
sixteen
hundred and eighty two, the
Marquis
du
Quesne
, with a large fleet and
several
bomb ketches, reached Algiers;
and, with his
sea
mortars, bombarded it
so
violently that, he laid
almost
the whole
city in ruins. Whether his orders went
no further, or the vice admiral judged he
had
chastised
them
sufficiently
, or
whether
a violent
storm
drove his fleet from its
moorings, does not appear. But it is
certain
,
that he left the city abruptly; and
the Algerines, to revenge this
insult
,
immediately
sent
their fleet to the
coast
of
France, and took
signal
reparation.
The next year, Du
Quesne
cast
anchor
before Algiers with a larger fleet; and, for
forty eight hours, made
such
deadly
discharges
with his cannon, and
showered
so
many bombs over this devoted city,
that the Dey
sued
for peace.
The French admiral with that
generosity
,
which is peculiar to his nation,
insisted
,
as an
indispensable
preliminary,
that all the
christian
slaves
should
be
sent
on board his
squadron
, with Mezemorto
the Dey's admiral, as a
hostage
for the
performance of this preliminary article.
The Dey
assembled
his divan, or council
of great officers, and communicated the
French demands. Mezemorto
immediately
collected the
sailors
, who had
manned
the ramparts, and with whom he was
a favourite; and,
accusing
the Dey of
cowardice, he
so
inflamed them that,
being
joined by the
soldiers
, they murdered
the Dey, and elected Mezemorto in
his
stead
. This was a
signal
for
renewed
hostility
, and never was there a
scene
of greater carnage. The French
seemed
to have
reserved
their fire for this
moment, when they poured
such
incessant
vollies of red hot
shot
, bombs, and
carcasses
into the city, that it was nearly all
in flames. The
streets
run blood, while
the politic and furious Mezemorto,
dreading
a change in the public mind, and
conscious
that another
cessation
of arms
would be attended with his death or
delivery
to the French, ran
furiously
round
the ramparts and exhorted the military to
their duty; and, to make his new
subjects
desperate
,
caused
all the French
slaves
to be murdered; and,
seizing
the French
consul
, who had been a
prisoner
among
them,
since
the
first
declaration of war, he
ordered him to be tied hand and foot, and
placed over a bomb mortar and
shot
into
the air towards the French fleet. The
French were
so
highly enraged, the
sailors
could
scarce
be prevented from attempting
to land, and
destroy
this barbarous race.
The vice admiral contented
himself
with
levelling their fortifications, reducing the
city to
rubbish
, and burning their whole
fleet. A fair opportunity now
presented
of preventing the Algerines from again
molesting
commerce. If the European
maritime powers had by treaty engaged
themselves
to
destroy
the
first
armed
galley
of the Algerines, which appeared
upon
the
seas
, and conjointly forbidden them
to repair their fortifications; this
people
might ere this have from
necessity
K 2
turned their attention to commerce; the
miscreants
and
outcasts
of other nations
would have no longer found refuge
among
them; and this people might at this
time have been as celebrated for the
peaceful
arts, as they are odious for the
constant
violation of the laws of nations and
humanity. This was
surely
the
common
interest
of the European powers;
but to talk of their common
interest
is idle.
The narrow politics of Europe
seek
an
individual not a common good; for no
sooner
had France humbled the
Algerines
than England thought it more for
her
interest
to enter into a treaty with
the new Dey, and, by way of douceur,
sent
to Algiers a
ship
load of naval and
military
stores
, to help them to rebuild
their navy and
strengthen
their
fortresses
;
while France, jealous
lest
the affections
of the
monster
Mezemorto, who
barbarously
murdered their fellow citizens,
should
be attached to their rival the
English
,
immediately patched up a peace
with the Algerines upon the
most
favourable
terms to the latter; and, to conclude
the farce,
sent
them another
ship
load of
similar
materials of
superious
value to
those
,
presented
by the
English
. This,
my readers, is a
small
specimen
of
European
policy.
The
latest
authentic account of any
attack
upon the Algerines was on the
twenty
third of June, one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seventy
five; when the
Spaniards
sent
the Count O'Reilly with a
respectable
fleet, twenty four
thousand
land
forces, and a prodigious train of artillery,
to
destroy
the city. The count landed
about two thirds of his troops, about a
league and an half to the
eastward
of the
city; but, upon marching into the
country
,
they were
opposed
by an
immense
army of natives. The Spaniards
say
, it
consisted
of one hundred and fifty
thousand
,
probably exaggerated by their
apprehensions
.
This is certain, they had
force
sufficient
, or
superiour
skill
to
defeat
the Spaniards, who retreated to their
ships
with the
loss
of thirteen cannon,
some
howitzers, and three
thousand
killed,
besides
prisoners
; while they
destroyed
six
thousand
Algerines. No
sooner
had
the treaty of Paris, in one
thousand
seven
hundred and eighty two, completely
liberated
the United States from their
dependence
upon the
British
nation than
that haughty,
exasperated
power, anxious
to
shew
their late
colonists
the value of
that protection, under which their
vessels
had heretofore navigated the
Mediterranean
,
excited the Algerines to capture
the
shipping
of the United States, who,
following from
necessity
the policy of
European nations, concluded a treaty
with this piratical
state
on the fifth of
September
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred and
ninety five.
Thus I have delineated a
sketch
of
Algerine
history
from actual information,
obtained upon the
spot
, and the
best
European
authorities. This dry detail of
facts will probably be
passed
over by
those
,
who read for mere
amusement
, but the
intelligent reader will, in this
concise
memoir
,
trace the leading principles of this
despotic
government; will account for the
avarice and rapacity of a people, who
live by plunder; perceive whence it
is that they are thus
suffered
to injure
commerce and outrage humanity; and
justify
our executive in concluding, what
some
uninformed men may
esteem
, a
humiliating
,
and too dearly
purchased
peace
with
these
free booters.

Description
of the City of Algiers
.
I cannot
give
so
particular
a
description
of this city, as I could
wish
,
or my readers may
desire
. Perhaps no
town contains
so
many places impervious
to
strangers
. The interiour of the Dey's
palace, and the female apartment of every
house
are
secluded
even from the natives.
No one approaches them but their
respective
masters
, while no
stranger
is permitted
to
inspect
the fortifications; and the
mosques
, or churches, are
scrupulously
guarded from the polluted
steps
of the
unbeliever
.
A poor
slave
, branded as an
infidel
,
would obtain only general information
from a
residence
in the
midst
of them.
Algiers is
situated
in the bay of that
name, and built upon the
sea
shore
, an
eminence, which
rises
above it, and which
naturally gave the
distinction
of the
upper
and lower city. Towards the
sea
, it
is
strengthened
with
vast
fortifications,
which are continued upon the mole,
which
secures
the port from
storms
and
assaults
. I never perambulated it, but
should
judge that, a line drawn from the
west
arm of the mole, and extended by
land, until it terminated on the
east
,
comprehending
the buildings, would
measure
about two miles. It contains one
hundred
and twenty
mosques
, two hundred
and twenty public baths, and
innumerable
coffee
houses
. The
mosques
are
large
stone
buildings, not lofty in
proportion
to their extent on the ground, and
have
usually
erected, upon their corners,
small
square
towers or minarets, whence
the inferiour
priests
call the people to
prayers. The baths are convenient
buildings, lighted on the top, provided
with cold and warm waters, which you
mingle at your
pleasure
, in
small
marble
cisterns
, by the
assistance
of
brass
cocks.
Every bather pays two rials at his
entrance
,
for which he is accommodated
with a
dressing
room, contiguous to the
bathing
cistern
, towels,
flesh
brushes
, and
other conveniences, a
glass
of
sherbet
, and
an
assistant
, if he
chooses
. The coffee
houses
or rooms are generally piazzas, with
an awning over them, projecting from
the front of the
houses
into the
streets
.
Here the inhabitants delight to loll, to
drink
sherbet
,
sip
coffee, and chew opium,
or
smoak
tobacco,
steeped
in a decoction
of this exhilarating drug.
I have already
sketched
a
description
of
the
houses
, and
shall
only add, that the
roofs are nearly flat with a
small
declivity
to
cast
the rain water into
spouts
.
Algiers
is tolerably well
supplied
with
spring
water, conveyed in pipes from the back
country; but the Algerines, who are
immoderately
attached to bathing, prefer
rain water, as
best
adapted to that
use
,
considering
it a luxury in
comparison
with
that, obtained from the
springs
or
sea
.
The inhabitants
say
, Algiers contains
twenty
thousand
houses
, one hundred
and forty
thousand
believers, twenty
two
thousand
Jews, and
six
thousand
christian
slaves
. I
suspect
, Algerine
vanity
has exaggerated the truth; but I
cannot
contradict it. Immediately before
the
census
of the inhabitants of the
United
States, I am told,
persons
, who
possessed
much better means of calculation,
misrated
the population of the principal
towns
most
egregiously

Argument.
The Government of the Algerines
.
It
has been noticed that
Hayraddin
Barbarossa
, in the beginning of the
sixteenth
century, rendered his kingdom
tributary to the Grand Seignior; and that,
in the year one
thousand
six
hundred and
twenty three, the Algerines threw off
their dependence on the
sublime
Porte.
Since that time, the
Turkish
court have
made
several
attempts to reduce the
Algerines
to their
subjection
; and, by
siding
with the numerous pretenders to the
regency,
so
common in this
unstable
government
,
they have, at times, apparently
effected their
design
: while the
Algerines
,
by
assassinating
or dethroning
those
princes,
whose
weakness
or wants have
induced
them to
submit
to extraneous power,
have reduced their dependence on the
sublime
Porte to a mere name. At
present
, the
Grand Seignior, fearful of
losing
the very
shadow
of authority, he has over them,
contents
himself
with receiving a tribute
almost
nominal;
consisting
chiefly of a
present
, towards defraying the
expenses
of the annual canopy, which is
sent
to
adorn
the prophet's tomb at Medina: while,
on the other hand, the Algerines,
dreading
the Grand Seignior's interference in
their popular commotions, allow the
sublime
Porte to confirm the election of their
Dey, and to badge his name, by affixing
and terminating it with
those
of the
principal
officers of the
Turkish
government.
Hence the
present
Dey,
whose
real name
is
Hassan
, is
styled
Vizier, which is
also
the appellation of the Grand Seignior's
first
minister
. As
Bashaw
, which
terminates
the Dey's name, is the
Turkish
title of their viceroys and principal
commanders
,
he makes war or peace,
negotiates
treaties, coins money, and performs
every other act of
absolute
independence.
Nor is the Dey
less
independent of his
own
subjects
. Though he obtains his
office frequently by the election of a
furious
soldiery
, and wades to the regency
through the blood of his
predecessor
; yet
he is no
sooner
invested
with the
insignia
of office, than, an implicit reverence is
paid to his commands, even by his
serocious
electors; and, though he often
summons
his divan or council of great
officers
,
yet they are merely
advisory
. He
conducts foreign affairs, at his own good
pleasure
; and, as to internal, he knows
no
restraint
, except from certain local
customs
,
opinions, and tenets, which he
himself
venerates, in common with his
meanest
subjects
.
Justice
is
administered
in his
name. He even determines
controversies
in his own
person
,
besides
being
supposed
virtually
present
in the
persons
of
his cadis or judges. If he inclines to
interfere
in the determination of a
suit
, upon
his approach, the authority of the cadis
cease
, and is merged in that of the Dey.
Some
customs
have been intimated, which
restrain
the Dey's
despotism
.
These
relate
principally to religion, property,
and females. He will not condemn
a
priest
to death; and, although
upon
the
decease
of a
subject
, his landed
property immediately
escheats
to the
reigning Dey, yet he never
seizes
it, in the
life of the
possessor
; and, when a man is
executed for the
highest
crime, the females
of his family are treated with
respect
:
nay, even in an
insurrection
of the
soldiery
,
when they murdered their Dey,
neither they nor his
successour
violated
the female apartments of the
slain
.
A mere love of novelty in the
soldiery
,
the
wish
to
share
the
largesses
of a new
sovereign
, the policy of his courtiers,
L 2
the ambition or popularity of his officers
or children, have not unfrequently
caused
the dethroning of the Dey; but the
more
systematic
cause
of his being
so
frequently dethroned
shall
be noticed in
our next chapter.

Revenue
.
The
Dey's revenue is
stated
by writers at
seven
hundred
thousand
dollars per annum. If the limits of this
work would permit, I think I could
prove it under rated, from a view of his
expenditures. It
arises
from a
slight
tax
upon
his
subjects
, a tribute from
some
Moors
and tribes of Arabs, in the interiour
country; a capitation tax upon the Jews;
prizes taken at
sea
;
presents
from foreign
powers, as the price of peace; annual
subsidies
from
those
nations, with whom he
is in alliance; and
customary
presents
,
made by his courtiers on his birth day.
To
these
may be added
sums
,
squeezed
from his
Bashaws
in the government of
the interiour provinces, and from the Jews,
as the price of his protection. With
these
supplies
he has to
support
the
magnificence
of his court, defray the
expense
of foreign
embassies
, pay his army,
supply
his navy, and repair his fortifications;
and, by frequent gratuities, if he is not
very
successful
and popular,
support
his
interest
among
those
, who have the power
to dethrone him. His proportion of the
prizes, captured at
sea
, and the
conciliatory
presents
, made by the commercial
powers, are the principal
sources
of his
revenue. It is
obviously
the policy of the
Dey, by frequently enfringing his treaties,
to augment his finances, by new captures
or
fresh
premiums for his
friendship
. A
pacific Dey is
sure
not to reign long; for,
beside
the
disgust
of the formidable body
of
sailors
, who are emulous of employ,
when the reigning Dey has once gone
through the routine of
seizing
the
vessels
,
receiving the
presents
, and concluding
treaties with the
usual
foreign powers, he
finds that the annual payments,
secured
by treaties, are
insufficient
for the
maintenance
of his
necessary
expenditures;
and is therefore
constrained
frequently
to declare war as a principle of
self
preservation
.
I have been told, the
present
Dey
condescended
to explain
these
principles
to an American agent in Algiers,
and grounded his capturing the
American
shipping
upon this
necessity
. I
must
,
said
the Dey, be at war with
some
nation,
and yours
must
have its turn. When
the Dey, from a pacific
disposition
or
dread of foreign power, is at peace with
the world, the
disgusted
sailor
and
avaricious
soldier
join to dethrone him;
having
established
it, as a maxim, that
all treaties expire with the reigning
Dey, and
must
be renewed with his
successour
. This is undoubtedly the
true
source
whence
spring
those
frequent
and dreadful
convulsions
, in the
regency of Algiers.

The Dey's Forces
.
There
are but few
vessels
actually belonging to the Dey's navy.
He has many marine officers, who rank
in the
sea
service
; but, except on great
expeditions, are permitted to command
the gallies of private adventurers; and it
is
these
picaroons, that make
such
dreadful
depredations on commerce. I can
give but a
slender
account of his land
forces.
Those
in
established
pay are
said
to amount to about eight
thousand
foot,
and two
thousand
Moorish
horse
. To
these
may be added four
thousand
inhabitants
of the city, who enrol
themselves
as
soldiers
, for protection in military
tumults
,
receive no pay, but are liable to
be called upon to man the fortifications
in emergency,
insurrection
, or
invasion
.
Perhaps there are more of this
species
in
the provinces. The
horse
are cantoned
in the country round the city, and do
duty
by detachments at the palace. Three
thousand
soot
are
stationed
in the
fortifications
,
and
marshalled
as the Dey's
guards. The
residue
of the land forces
are
distributed
among the
Bashaws
to
overawe
the provinces. But the
principal
reliance, in
case
of
invasion
, is the
vast
bodies of what may be
styled
militia
,
which the
Bashaws
, in
case
of
emergency
,
lead from the interiour country.

Algerines

The
men wear next to their
bodies a linen
shirt
, or rather
chemise
,
and drawers of the
same
texture. Over
their
shirt
a linen or
silk
gown, which is
girded about their loins by a
sash
, in the
choice of which they exhibit much fancy.
In this
dress
their legs and lower
extremity
of their arms are bare. As an outer
garment, a
loose
coat of
coarser
materials
is thrown over the whole. They wear
turbans, which are long pieces of
muslin
Vol. II. M
or
silk
curiously
folded,
so
as to form a
cap comfortable and ornamental.
Slippers
are
usually
worn, though the
soldiers
are provided with a
sort
of
buskin
,
resembling
our half boots. The
dress
of
the women, I am told, for I never had
the
pleasure
of
inspecting
it very
critically
,
resembles
that of the men, except that
their drawers are longer, and their out
side
garment is like our old
fashioned
ridinghoods
.
When the ladies walk the
streets
,
they are muffled with bandages or
handkerchiefs
of
muslin
or
silk
over their faces,
which conceals all but their eyes; and, if
toonearly
inspected
, will let fall a large vail,
which conceals them intirely. The men
usually
set
cross
legged upon
mattresses
, laid
upon low
seats
at the
sides
of the room.
They loll on
cushions
at their meals; and,
after their
repasts
,
occasionally
indulge
with a
short
slumber
. I have
such
a
laudable
attachment to the
customs
of my own
country, that I doubt whether I can
judge candidly of their cookery or mode
of eating. The former would be
unpalatable
and the latter
disgusting
to
most
Americans
;
for
saffron
is their common
seasoning
. They cook their
provisions
to rags or pap, and eat it with their
fingers
,
though the better
sort
use
spoons
.
Their
diversions
consist
in
associating
in
the coffee
houses
, in the city, and, in the
country, under groves, where they
smoke
and chat, and drink cooling not ine
briating
liquors. Their more active
amusements
are riding and throwing the dart,
at both which they are very expert.
They
sometimes
play at
chess
and drafts,
but never at games of chance or for
money
;
those
being
expressly
forbidden by
the alcoran.

Marriages and Funerals
.
It
is the privilege of travellers
to exaggerate; but I
wish
not to avail
myself
of this
prescriptive
right. I had
rather
disappoint
the
curiosity
of my
readers by
conciseness
, than
disgust
them
with untruths. I have no ambition to be
ranked among the Bruces and
Chastelreux
of the age. I
shall
therefore
endeavour
rather to improve the
understanding
of my reader, with what I really know,
man
amuse
him with
stories
, of which
my
circumscribed
situation
rendered me
necessarily
ignorant. I never was at an
Algerine marriage; but obtained
some
authentic information on the
subject
.
That extreme caution, which
separates
the
sexes
in elder life, is
also
attached to
the youth. In Algiers, the young
people
never collect to dance,
converse
, or
amuse
themselves
with the innocent gaities
of their age. Here are no theatres,
balls, or concerts; and, even in the
public
duties of religion, the
sexes
never
assemble
together. An Algerine
courtship
would be as
disagreeable
to the hale youth
of New England, as a common bundling
would be
disgusting
to the
Mussulman
.
No opportunity is
assorded
to the young
suitor
to
search
for
those
nameless
bewitching
M 2
qualities and attentions, which attach
the American youth to his
mistress
, and
form the
basis
of connubial
bliss
; nor is
the young Algerine permitted, by a
thousand
tender
assiduities
, to win the
affections
of the future partner of his life.
His choice can be only directed by the
rank or
respectability
of the father of his
intended bride. He never
sees
her face,
until after the nuptial ceremony is
performed
;
and even
some
days after
she
has been brought home to his own
house
.
The old people frequently make the
match, or, if it originates with the youth,
he confides his
wishes
to his father or
some
respectable
relation, who
communicates
the
proposal
to the lady's father.
If he receives it favourably, the young
couple are allowed to exchange
some
unmeaning
messages
, by an old
nurse
of the
family. The bride's father or her next
male kin, with the bridegroom, go before
the Cadi and
sign
a contract of marriage,
which is
attested
by the relatives on each
side
. The bridegroom then pays a
stipulated
sum
to the bride's father; the
nuptial
ceremony is performed in private,
and the bridegroom retires. After
some
days, the bride is richly arrayed,
accompanied
by females, and conveyed in a
covered coach or waggon, gaudy with
flowers, to her
husband
's
house
. Here
she
is immediately immured in the
women's
apartments, while the bridegroom
and his friends
share
a convivial
feast
.
After
some
ceremonies, the nature of
which I could not
discover
, the
bridegroom
enters the women's apartment,
and for the
first
time
discovers
whether
his wife has a
nose
or eyes. Among the
higher ranks, it is
said
, the bride, after
the expiration of a month, goes to the
public bath for women, is there
received
with great parade, and loaded with
presents
by her female relations,
assembled
on the
occasion
. The
bridegroom
also
receives
presents
from his
friends.
Within a limited time, the
husband
may break the contract, provided he will
add another item to that already given,
return his bride with all her
paraphernalia
;
and, putting the holy alcoran to his
breast
,
assert
that he never benefited
himself
of the rights of an
husband
.
Notwithstanding
the apparent
restraint
,
the women are under, they are
said
to be
attached to their
husbands
, and enjoy
greater liberty than is generally
conceived
.
I certainly
saw
many women in the
streets
,
so
muffled up, and
so
similar
from
their outward garment, that their
nearest
relatives could-not
distinguish
one from
another. The vulgar
slaves
conjecture
that the women take great liberties in this
general
disguise
.
Their funerals are decent but not
ostentatious
.
I
saw
many. The corps,
carried
upon a bier, is preceded by the
priests
,
chanting
passages
from the alcoran
in a dolorous tone. Wherever the
procession
passes
, the people join in
this dirge. The relatives follow, with
the folds of their turbans
loosened
.
The bodies of the rich are
deposited
in vaults,
those
of the poor, in graves.
A pillar of marble is erected over them,
with an unblown
rose
carved on the top
for the unmarried.
At certain
seasons
, the women of the
family join a
procession
in
close
habits,
and proceed to the tomb or grave, and
adorn
it with garlands of flowers. When
these
processions
pass
, the
slaves
are
obliged
to throw
themselves
on the ground
with their faces in the
dust
, and all, of
whatever rank, cover their faces.

The Religion of the Algerines: Life of the
Prophet Mahomet
.
In
describing
the religious
tenets
of the Algerines, the attention is
immediately
drawn to Mahomet or
Mahomed
,
the founder of their faith.
This fortunate
impostor
, like all other
great characters in the drama of life, has
been indignantly vilified by his
opponents
,
and as ardently
praised
by his
adherents
.
I
shall
endeavour to
steer
the
middle
course
of impartiality; neither
influenced by the biggoted
aversion
of
Sales and Prideaux, or the
specious
praise
of the
philosophic
Boulanvilleirs
.
Mahomet was born in the five
hundred
and
sixty
ninth year of the
christian
era. He was
descended
from the Coreis,
one of the
noblest
of the Arabian tribes.
His father, Abdalla, was a man of
moderate
fortune, and
bestowed
upon his
son
such
an education as a parent in
consined
,
if not
impoverished
circumstances
, could
confer. The Turks
say
, he could not
write;
because
they pride
themselves
in
decrying letters, and
because
the pious
among them
suppose
his ignorance of
letters
a
sufficient
evidence of the divine
original
of the book, he
published
, as
received
from and written by the finger of
Deity.
But when the Arabian authors record,
that he was employed as a factor by his
uncle
Abutileb, there can little doubt remain
but that he was
possessed
of all the
literary
acquirements,
necessary
to
accomplish
him for his
business
. He has been
stigmatized
as a mere camel driver. He
had the direction of camels it is true.
The merchandize of Arabia was
transported
to different regions by
carrivans
of
these
useful
animals, of a
troop of which he was conductor; but
there was as much difference between his
station
and employment, and that of a
common camel driver, as between the
supercargo
of an India
ship
in our days,
and the
seaman
before the
mast
. In his
capacity of factor, he travelled into
Syria
,
Palestine
, and Egypt; and acquired
the
most
useful
knowledge in each
country
.
He is
represented
as a man of a
beautiful
person
, and commanding
presence
.
By his engaging manners and
remarkable
attention to
business
, he became
the factor of a rich Arabian merchant,
after
whose
death he married his widow,
the beautiful Cadija, and came into the
lawful
possession
of
immense
wealth, which
awakened in him the
most
unbounded
ambition. By the venerable
custom
of
his nation, his political career was
confined
to his own tribe; and, the
patriarchal
being the prominent feature of the
Arabian government, he could not hope
to
surmount
the claims of elder families,
even in his own tribe, the genealogies of
which were accurately
preserved
. To
be the founder and prophet of a new
religion
would
secure
a glorious
preeminence
,
highly gratifying to his ambition,
and not thwarting the
pretensions
of the
tribes.
Mankind are apt to impute the
most
profound abilities to founders of religious
systems
, and other fortunate adventurers,
when perhaps they owe their
success
more
to a fortunate coincidence of
circumstances
,
and their only merit is the
sagacity
to avail
themselves
of that tide in
the affairs of men, which leads to wealth
and honour. Perhaps there never was a
Vol. II. N
conjuncture more favourable for the
introduction
of a new religion than that, of
which Mahomet availed
himself
. He
was
surrounded
by Arian
christians
,
whose
darling creed is the unity of the
Deity, and who had been
persecuted
by
the
Athenasians
into an abhorrence of
almost
every other
christian
tenet: by
Jews, who had fled from the vindictive
Emperour Adrian, and who, too
willfully
blind to
see
the
accomplishment
of
their prophecies in the
person
of our
Saviour
,
in the
midst
of exile were ready to
contemn
those
prophecies, which had
so
long deluded them with a
Messiah
, who
never
came: and by Pagans,
whose
belief in
a plurality of gods made them the ready
proselytes
of any novel
system
; and the
more
wise
of whom were
disgusted
with
the
gross
adsurdities
of their own
mythology
.
The
system
of Mahomet is
said
to
have been calculated to attach all
these
.
To gratify the Arian and the Jew, he
maintained the unity of God; and, to
please
the Pagans, he adopted many of
their external rites as
fastings
,
washings
,
&c. Certain it is, he
spoke
of
Moses
and
the patriarchs, as
messengers
from heaven,
and that he declared
Jesus
Christ
to be
the true
Messias
, and the exemplary
pattern
of a good life, a
sentiment
critically
expressing
the Arian opinion. The
slories
of Mahomet's having retired to a
cave with a monk and a Jew to compile
his book; and falling into fits of the
epilepsy
,
persuading
his
disciples
that
these
fits were trances in order to propagate his
system
more effectually,
so
often related
by geography compilers, like the tales of
Pope Joan and the nag's head
consecration
of the
English
bishops
, are fit only to
amuse
the vulgar. It is certain, he
secluded
himself
from company and
assumed
an
austerity
of manners, becoming the
reformer of a vicious world. In his
retirement
,
he commenced writing the al
coran. His
first
proselytes
were of his
own family, the next, of his near
relatives
.
But the tribe of Corei were
so
familiar
with the
person
and life of
Mahomet
that they
despised
his
pretensions
;
and, fearful
lest
what they
styled
his mad
enthusiasm
should
bring a
stigma
upon
their tribe, they
first
attempted to
reason
him out of his
supposed
delusion
; and,
this failing, they
sought
to
destroy
him.
But a
special
messenger
of heaven, who,
Mahomet
says
,
measured
ten million
furlongs
at every
step
, informed him of their
design
, and he
sled
to Medina, the
inhabitants
of which, being already
prepossessed
in favour of his doctrine, received him
with great
respect
.
[5]
[5]
This flight was in the
six
hundred and
twenty
second
year of the
christian
era, when
Mahomet
was fifty four years of age. The
Mahometans
of all
sectaries
commence their computation
of time from this period, which they
style
the
hegira
,
or flight.
He
soon
inspired
them with the
most
implicit confidence in the divinity of his
mission
, and confirmed their faith by
daily
portions of the alcoran, which he
declared
was written by the finger of God,
and
transmitted
to him immediately from
heaven by archangels,
commissioned
for
that important
purpose
. He declared
himself
the
Sent of God
, the
sword
of his
almighty power,
commissioned
to enforce the
unity of the divine
essence
, the
unchangeableness
of his eternal decrees, the future
bliss
of true believers, and the torment of
the damned, among the nations. He
boldly pronounced all
those
, who died
fighting in his
cause
, to be entitled to the
glory of martyrs in the heavenly
paradise
;
and, availing
himself
of
some
of the
antient
feuds among the neighbouring
tribes,
caused
his
disciples
in Medina to
wage war upon their neighbours, and
they invariably conquered, when he
headed their troops. The tribe of Corei
N 2
flattered by the honours, paid their
kinsman
,
and confounded by the repeated
reports of his victories, were
soon
proselyted
,
and become afterwards the
most
enthusiastic
supporters
of his power. In
six
hundred and twenty
seven
, he was
crowned fovereign at Medina, like the
divine
Melchisedec
, uniting in his
person
the high titles of prophet and king. He
subdued
the greater part of Arabia, and
obtained a
respectable
footing in Syria.
He died at Medina in the year
six
hundred
and thirty three, and in the
sixty
fourth year of his age. European
writers
,
who have
destroyed
almost
as many
great
personages
by
poison
as the French
have with the guillotine, have attributed
his death to a
dose
administered
by a
monk. But when we
consider
his
advanced
age and public energies, we need
not recur to any but natural means for
the
cause
of his death.

The Sects of Omar and Ali
.
Upon
the
decease
of the
prophet, his followers were
almost
confounded
.
They could
scarce
credit their
senses
. They fancied him only in a
swoon
, and waited in
respectful
silence
until he
should
again
arise
to lead them
to
conquest
and glory. His more
confidential
friends gathered around the
corpse
; and, being
impressed
with the
policy of immediately announcing his
successour
, they held a fierce debate upon
the
subject
. In the alcoran, they found
no direction for the election, nor any
successour
to the caliphate pointed out.
They agreed to
send
for his wives and
confidential
domestics
. The
youngest
of his wives produced
some
writings,
containing the precious
sayings
of the
prophet, which,
she
said
,
she
had
collected
for her own edification. To
these
were afterwards added
such
observations
of
the prophet, as his more intimate
associates
could recollect, or the policy of
those
in power invent.
These
were annexed to
the alcoran, and
esteemed
of equal
authority
.
This compilation was called
the book of the companions of the
apostle
.
In the writings, produced by his
favourite
wife, the prophet had directed his
great officers to elect his
successour
from
among them, and
assured
them that a
portion of his own power would
rest
upon
him. Abubeker, a friend and relative,
and
successful
leader of the forces of the
prophet, by the
persuasions
of
those
around
,
immediately entered the public
mosque
; and,
standing
on the
steps
of
the
desk
, from which the prophet
used
to
deliver his oracles, he informed the
multitude
that God had indeed called the
prophet to
paradise
, and that his kingly
authority and
apostolic
powers
rested
upon
him. To him
succeeded
Omar and
Osman
: while the troops in Syria,
conceiving
that Ali, their leader, was better
entitled to
succeed
than either, elevated
him
also
to the caliphate, though he
refused
the dignity until he was called by the
voice of the people to
succeed
Osman
.
Hence
sprang
that great
schism
, which
has divided the
Mussulman
world; but,
though divided, as to the
successour
of
the prophet, both parties were actuated
by his principles and adhered to his creed.
Omar and his
successours
turned their
arms towards Europe; and, under the
name of Saracens or Moors,
possessed
themselves
of the greater part of Spain
and the Mediterranean
isles
: while the
friends of Ali,
establishing
themselves
as
sovereigns
, made equal ravages upon
Persia
, and even to the great
peninsula
of
India.
The Algerines are of the
sect
of Omar,
which, like many other religious
schisms
,
differs more in name, than in any
fundamental
point of creed or practice from
that of Ali. The propriety of the
translation
of the alcoran into the
Persian
language
,
and the
succession
of the caliphate
seem
the great
standards
of their
respective
creeds.

Argument.
The Faith of the Algerines
.
The
Algerine doctors
assert
,
that the language of the alcoran is
so
ineffably
pure, it can never be rendered
into any other tongue. To this they
candidly impute the
miserable
, vitiated
translations
of the
christians
, who they
charge with having garbled the
sacred
book, and degraded its
sublime
alegories
and metaphors into
absurd
tales. This
is certain, the portions, I have heard
chanted at funerals and quoted in
conversation
,
ever exhibited the
purest
morality
and the
sublimest
conceptions of the
Deity. The fundamental doctrine of the
alcoran is the unity of God. The evil
spirit
,
says
the koran, is
subtly
deluding
men, into the belief that there are more
gods than one, that in the
confusion
of
deities he may obtain a
share
of
devotion
;
while the Supreme Being, pitying
the
delusions
of man, has
sent
Abraham,
Moses
, Soliman, breathed forth the
Messias
of the
christian
in a
sigh
of divine
pity, and
lastly
sent
Mahomet, the
seal
of
the prophets, to reclaim men to this
essential
truth. The next fundamental
points in the
Mussulman
creed are a
belief
in the eternal decrees of God, in a
resurrection
and final judgment to
bliss
or
misery
. Some hold with
christians
that
the future
punishment
will be infinite,
while others
suppose
that, when the
souls
of the wicked are purified by fire, they
will be received into the favour of God.
They adhere to many other points of
practical duty:
such
as daily prayers,
frequent
ablutions, acts of charity and
severe
fastings
; that of rhammadin, is the principal,
which is
similar
to the catholic lent, in
abstinence
,
for the penitent
abstains
only from
a particular kind of food, while he gluts
himself
with others perhaps more
luscious
.
The alcoran
also
forbids games
of chance, and the
use
of
strong
liquors;
inculcates a
tenderness
for idiots, and a
respect
for age. The book of the
companions
of the
apostle
enjoins a
pilgrimage
to his tomb, to be made by the true
believers once at
least
in their lives: but
though they view the authority, which
enjoined this tedious journey divine, yet
they have contrived to evade its rigour
by allowing the believer to perform it by
proxy or attorney.
Upon the whole, there does not appear
to be any articles in their faith, which
incite
them to immorality or can
countenance
the cruelties, they commit. Neither
Vol. II. O
their alcoran nor their
priests
excite them
to plunder,
inslave
or torment. The
former
expressly
recommends charity,
justice
, and mercy towards their fellow
men. I would not bring the
sacred
volume
of our faith in any comparative view
with the alcoran of Mahomet; but I
cannot help noticing it as extraordinary,
that the Mahometan
should
abominate
the
christian
on account of his faith, and
the
christian
detest
the
Mussulman
for
his creed; when the koran of the former
acknowledges the divinity of the
christian
Messias
, and the bible of the latter
commands
us to love our enemies. If each
would follow the obvious dictates of his
own
scripture
, he would
cease
to hate,
abominate, and
destroy
the other.

Argument.
Why do not the Powers in Europe
suppress
the Algerine Depredations? is a
Question
frequently
asked
in the United
States
.
I answer
, that this
must
be
effected by a union of the European
maritime
powers with the Grand Seignior; by
a combination among
themselves
; or by
an individual exertion of
some
particular
state
. A union of the European powers
with the Grand Seignior
most
probably
would be attended with
success
; but
this is not to be expected; as it never can
be the
interest
of the
sublime
Porte to
suppress
them, and the common faith of
the
Mussulman
has more influence in
uniting its
professors
than the creed of the
christian
, to the
disgrace
of the
latter
:
and, as the Grand Seignior's dominion
over the Algerines is little more than
nominal, he is anxious to conciliate their
favour by affording them his protection;
considering
prudently, that though
intractable
,
they are
still
a branch of the
Mussulman
stock
. Provoked by their
insults
, he has
sometimes
withdrawn his
protection, as was the
case
, when he by
treaty with the Venetians permitted their
fleet to enter the Ottoman ports, for the
express
purpose
of
destroying
the
Algerine
gallies; but, it is obvious, the
sublime
Porte meant merely to
chastise
not to ruin
them.
In the Grand Seignior's wars with the
Europeans, the piratical
states
have
rendered
signal
services
, and he
himself
not
unfrequently receives valuable douceurs
for exerting his
supposed
influence over
them, in favour of one or another of the
contending powers of Europe. In the
siege
of Gibraltar by the Spaniards,
during
the late American war, that
garrison
received frequent
supplies
of
provision
from the Barbary Shore; but, by the
application
of Louis XVI. to the
sublime
Porte, the Grand Seignior influenced the
Barbary
states
to prohibit
those
supplies
;
and the
English
consul
was
dismissed
from
one of them with the
most
pointed marks
of contempt. While the Grand
Seignior
reaps
such
solid
advantages from
them, it is
absurd
to predicate upon his
cooperation
against
them; neither can a
union of the European powers be more
fully anticipated.
Jealousy
as often
actuates
mighty nations, as weak individuals.
Whoever turns the pages of
history
with
profit, will perceive that
sordid
passion
is
the
impulse
of action to the
greatest
states
. Commercial
states
are
also
actuated
O 2
by avarice, a
passion
still
more
baneful
in its effects.
These
excite war, and
are the grand plenipotentiaries in the
adjustment
of the articles of peace. Hence
it is, that, while every European power is
solicitous
to enrich and aggrandize
itself
,
it can never join in any common project,
the
result
of which, it is jealous, may
advantage
its neighbour; and is content to
suffer
injury, rather than its rival
should
share
in a common good. Hence it is,
that
christian
states
,
instead
of uniting to
vindicate their
insulted
faith, join the
cross
and the
crescent
in unholy alliance,
and form degrading treaties with piratical
powers; and, as the acme of political
folly,
present
those
very powers, as the
purchase
of their
friendship
, weapons to
annoy
themselves
in the
first
war, that
their avarice or caprice
shall
wage. But,
if ever a confederacy of the European
powers
should
be formed
against
the
Algerines
,
experience affords us but
slender
hopes of its
success
; for, I will venture to
assert
, that from the confederacy of Ahab
and
Jehoshaphat
, when they went up to
battle to Ramoth Gilead, to the treaty of
Philnitz, there never was a combination
of princes or nations, who, by an actual
union of their forces, attained the object
of their coalition. If the political finger
is pointed to the war of the allies of Queen
Anne, and the
conquests
of the Duke of
Marlborough, as an exception, I
likewise
point to the
distracting
period, when that
conqueror was
superceded
by the Duke of
Ormond, and the treaty of Utrecht will
confirm the opinion I have advanced.
The detail of the
history
of the
Algerines
evinces, that the arms of individual
states
can be attended with no
decisive
success
. Indeed, the
expense
of an
efficacious
armament would defray the price
of the Dey's
friendship
for years; and
the powers of Europe
submit
to his
insults
and injuries from a principle of
economy
.
An
absolute
conquest
of the
Algerine territory cannot be effected but
by
invasion
from the interiour, through the
cooperation of the Grand Seignior or the
assistance
of the other Barbary
states
.
The former I have
shewn
cannot be
predicated
,
and the latter, for obvious
reasons
,
is as little to be expected. A
permanent
conquest
of the city and port of
Algiers cannot be effected, without the
subjection
of the interiour country.
Temporary
though
spirited
attacks, upon that
city and port, have never
answered
any
salutary
purpose
. They may be
compared
to the
destruction
of our
seaports
,
in our revolutionary war. The port
attacked
bore
so
small
a proportion to the
whole, that its
destruction
rather
served
to
irritate, than to weaken or
subjugate
. It
should
be
considered
,
likewise
, that the
houses
of the Algerines are built of
slight
and cheap materials; that upon the
approach
of an enemy the rich effects of
the inhabitants are
easily
removed
inland
,
while nothing remains but heavy
fortifications to batter, and buildings,
which can be readily
restored
, to
destroy
.
The following anecdote will
shew
how
sensible
the Algerines
themselves
are of
these
advantages. When the French
vice admiral, the Marquis de
Quesne
,
made his
first
attack on Algiers, he
sent
an
officer with a flag on
shore
, who
magnified
the force of his commander, and
threatened
to lay the city in
ashes
, if the
demands
of the marquis were not
immediately
complied with. The Dey, who
had, upon the
first
approach of the
enemy
,
removed the aged, the females and
his
richest
effects, coolly inquired of the
officer how much the levelling his city
to
ashes
would
cost
. The officer,
thinking
to
encrease
the Dey's admiration of
the power of the Grand Monarque,
answered
,
two millions of livres. Tell
your commander,
said
the Dey, if he
will
send
me half the money I will burn
the city to
ashes
myself
.

Argument.
An Algerine Law Suit
.
An
officer of police parades
the city at uncertain hours, and in all
directions
,
accompanied by an executioner
and other attendants. The
process
of his
court is entirely verbal. He examines
into all breaches of the
customs
, all frauds,
especially
in weights and
measures
, all
sudden
affrays,
disputes
concerning
personal
property, and compels the
performance
of contracts. He determines
causes
on the
spot
, and the delinquent is
punished
in his
presence
. The
usual
punishments
, he inflicts, are fines, beating
on the
soles
of the feet,
dismemberment
of the right hand; and, it is
said
, he has
a power of taking life; but, in
such
case
,
an appeal lies to the Dey. If complaint
is made to him of the military, the
priests
or officers of the court, navy, or
customs
,
or
against
persons
attached to the families
of the
consuls
, envoys, or other
representatives
of foreign powers, upon
suggestion
,
the
cause
is immediately reported to the
Dey, who hears the
same
in
person
, or
deputes
some
officer of rank to determine
it, either from the civil, military, or
religious
orders, as the nature of the
cause
may require. In fact, this officer of
police
seldom
judges any
cause
of great
importance
.
The object of his
commission
seems
to be the detection and
punishment
of common cheats, and to
suppress
broils among the vulgar; and, as he has
the power to adapt the
punishment
to the
enormity of the offence, he often
exercises
it
capriciously
, and,
sometimes
,
ludicrously
.
I
saw
a baker, who, for
selling
bread under weight, was
sentenced
to
walk the public market, three times each
day, for three days in
succession
, with a
small
loaf, attached by a ring to each of his
ears; and to cry aloud at
short
distances
bread for the poor
. This excited
the
resentment
of the rabble, who
followed
him with abundance of
coarse
ridicule.
Besides
this itinerant judge, there are
many others, who never meddle with
suits
,
unless
they are brought formally
before them, which is done by mere
verbal
complaint; they
send
for the parties
and
witnesses
, and determine
almost
as
summarily
as the officer of police. I
confess
that, when I left the United States,
the golden fee, the lengthy bill of
cost
,
the law's delay, and the writings of
Honestus
,
had taught me to view the judicial
proceedings of our country with a
jaundiced
eye; and, when I was made
acquainted
with the Algerine mode of
distributive
justice
, I yearned to
see
a
cause
determined in a court, where
instant
decision
relieved the anxiety, and
saved
the
purses
of the parties; and where no long
winded attorney was
suffered
to perplex
the judge with
subtle
argument or
musty
precedent. I was
soon
delighted with an
excellent
display
of
summary
justice
.
Observing
a collection of people upon a
piazza, I leaned over the rails, and
discovered
that an Algerine cadi or judge
had
just
opened his court. The cadi
was
seated
cross
legged on a
cushion
with a
slave
, with a whip and batten on one
side
;
and another with a drawn
scimitar
on the
other. The plaintiff came forward and told
his
story
. He charged a man, who was in
custody
, with having
sold
him a mule,
which he
said
was
sound
, but which
proved
blind and lame. Several
witnesses
were then called, who proved the
contract
and the defects of the mule. The
defendant was then called upon for his
defence. He did not deny the fact, but
Vol. II. P
pleaded the law of retaliation. He
said
,
he was a good
Mussulman
, performed all
the rites of their holy religion, had
sent
a
proxy to the prophet's tomb at Medina,
and maintained an idiot; that he never
cheated any man before, but was
justified
in what he had done, for, ten years before,
the plaintiff had cheated him
worse
in
the
sale
of a dromedary, which proved
broken winded. He proved this by
several
witnesses
, and the plaintiff could not
deny it. The judge immediately
ordered
the mule and the money paid for it to
be produced. He then directed his
attendants
to
seize
the defendant, and give
him fifty blows on the
soles
of his feet
for this fraud. The plaintiff at every
stroke
applauded the cadi's
justice
to the
skies
; but, no
sooner
was the
punishment
inflicted, than, by a nod from the judge,
the exulting plaintiff was
seized
and
received
the
same
number of blows with the
batten for the old affair of the broken
winded dromedary. The parties were
then
dismissed
, without
costs
, and the
judge ordered an officer to take the mule,
fell it at publick outcry, and
distribute
the
product, with the money
deposited
, in
alms to the poor. The officer proceeded
a few
steps
with the mule, and, I thought,
the court had
risen
, when the cadi,
supposing
one of the
witnesses
had
prevaricated
in his
testimony
, called back the
officer
,
who had charge of the mule,
ordered
the
witness
to receive twenty five
blows of the batten, and be mounted on
the back of the mule, with his face
towards
the tail, and be thus carried
through the city, directing the mule to
be
stopped
at every corner, where the
culprit
should
exclaim; before the
enlightened
,
excellent,
just
, and merciful
cadi Mir Karchan, in the trial of
Osman
Beker and Abu
Isoul
, I
spake
as I ride.
The people around magnified Mir
Karchan
for this exemplary
justice
; and I
present
it to my fellow citizens. If it is
generally
pleasing
, it may be
easily
introduced
among us. Some
obstinate
people
may be
still
attached to our
customary
modes of
dispensing
justice
, and think
that the advocates we fee, and the
precedents
they quote, are but guards and
enclosures
round our judges, to prevent
them from
capriciously
invading the
rights of the citizens.

A Mahometan Sermon
.
I once
had an opportunity
of approaching unnoticed the window of
one of the principal
mosques
. After the
customary
prayers, the
priest
pronounced
the following
discourse
with a dignified
elocution. It was received by his
audience
with a reverence, better becoming
christians
than infidels. It undoubtedly
suffers
from
translation
and the
sickleness
of my memory; but the manner, in which
it was delivered, and the energy of many
of the
expressions
made
so
strong
an
impression
,
that I think I have not
materially
P 2
varied from the
sentiment
. I
present
it to the candid reader, as a curious
specimen
of their pulpit eloquence; and as,
perhaps, conveying a more
satisfactory
idea of their creed, than I have already
attempted, in the account I have given of
their religion. The attributes of Deity
were the
subject
of the
priest
's
discourse
;
and, after
some
exordium, he elevated his
voice and exclaimed:
God alone is immortal
.
Ibraham

fathers, Cadijah the

all died. But God
most

are to
him, as the numerals of arithmetic to the

shall
vanish

destiny
;
but he liveth and reigneth forever.
God alone is omniscient

Michael

whose
wings are full of eyes, is
blind before him, the dark night is unto
him as the rays of the morning; for he
noticeth the creeping of the
small
pismire

stone
,
and apprehendeth the motion of an atom
in the open air.
God alone is omnipresent
. He
toucheth the
immensity
of
space
, as a
point. He moveth in the depths of
ocean
,
and mount Atlas is hidden by the
sole
of his foot. He breatheth fragrant
odours to cheer the
blessed
in
paradise
, and
enliveneth the pallid flame in the
profoundest
hell.
God alone is omnipotent
. He
thought, and worlds were created; he
frowneth, and they
dissolve
into thin
smoke
; he
smileth
, and the torments of
the damned are
suspended
. The
thunderings
of Hermon are the
whisperings
of his voice; the
rustling
of his attire
causeth
lightning and an earthquake; and
with the
shadow
of his garment he
blotteth
out the fun.
God alone is merciful
. When
he forged his immutable decrees on the
anvil of eternal
wisdom
, he tempered the
miseries
of the race of
Ismael
in the
fountains
of pity. When he laid the
foundations
of the world, he
cast
a look of
benevolence
into the
abysses
of futurity;
and the adamantine pillars of eternal
justice
were
softened
by the beamings of his
eyes. He dropt a tear upon the embryo
miseries
of unborn man; and that tear,
falling through the
immeasurable
lapses
of
time,
shall
quench the glowing flames of
the
bottomless
pit. He
sent
his prophet
into the world to enlighten the
darkness
of the tribes; and hath prepared the
pavilions
of the Houri for the
repose
of the
true believers.
God alone is just
. He chains the
latent
cause
to the
distant
event; and
binds them both immutably
fast
to the
fitness
of things. He decreed the
unbeliever
to wander
amidst
the whirlwinds of
errour; and
suited
his
soul
to future
torment
.
He promulgated the ineffable creed,
and the germs of
countless
souls
of
believers
,
which
existed
in the contemplation of
Deity, expanded at the
sound
. His
justice
refresheth
the faithful, while the damned
spirits
confess
it in
despair
.
God alone is one
. Ibraham the
faithful knew it.
Moses
declared it
amidst
the thunderings of Sinai.

pronounced; it and the

Surely there is one God, IMMORTAL,

Argument.
Of the Jews
.
I have
thus given
some
succinct
notices of the
history
, government,
religion
,
habits, and manners of this ferocious
race. I have
interspersed
reflections,
which, I hope, will be received by the
learned with candour; and
shall
now
resume
the thread of my more appropriate
narrative.
By unremitted attention to the
duties
of my office, and
some
fortunate
operations in
surgery
, I had now
so
far
ingratiated
myself
with the director and
physicians
of the infirmary, that I was
allowed
to be
absent
any hours of the day,
when my
business
in the
hospital
permitted
,
without rendering any
especial
reason
for my
absence
. I wandered into all
parts of the city, where
strangers
were
permitted to walk,
inspected
every object
I could, without giving umbrage. I
sometimes
strayed
into that quarter of the city,
principally inhabited by Jews. This
cunning
race,
since
their
dispersion
by
Vespasian
and Titus, have contrived to
compensate
themselves
for the
loss
of
Palestine
,
by
engrossing
the wealth, and
often the luxuries of every other land;
and, wearied with the expectation of that
heavenly king, who
shall
repossess
them
of the holy city, and put their enemies
beneath
their feet, now
solace
themselves
with a
Messiah
,
whose
glory is
enshrined
in their coffers. Rigidly attached to
their own
customs
, intermarrying among
themselves
, content to be apparently
wretched and
despised
, that they may
wallow
in
secret
wealth; and
secluded
, in
most
countries, from holding landed
property
,
and in
almost
all from filling
offices
of power and profit, they are
generally
received as meet
instruments
to do
the mean drudgery of
despotic
courts.
The wealth, which would render a
subject
too powerful, the
despot
can
trust
with an unambitious Jew; and confide
secrets
, which involve his own
safety
to a
miserable
Israelite
, whom he can
annihilate
with a nod. The Jews
transact
almost
all the Dey's private
business
,
besides
that of the negotiations of merchants.
Nay, if an envoy from a foreign power
comes to treat with the Dey, he may have
the parade of a public audience; but,
if he
wishes
to
accomplish
his
embassy
,
he
must
employ a Jew: and, it is
said
,
the Dey
himself
shares
with the Jew the
very
sums
paid him for his influence with
this politic
despot
. The Jews are
also
the
spies
of the Dey, upon his

home, and the channels of intelligence
from foreign powers. They are

and have frequently an influence
at the court of the Dey, with his great
officers, and even before the civil judge,
not to be accounted for from the morality
of their conduct. Popular prejudice is
generally
against
them; and the Dey
often
avails
himself
of it by heavy
amercements
for his protection. In the year
one
thousand
six
hundred and ninety,
he threatened to extirpate the whole
race in his dominions, and was
finally
appeased
by a large contribution
they
raised
and offered as an expiation
of a
supposed
offence. It was commonly
reported, that the Jews in Algiers, at that
time, had procured a
christian
child,
which they privately purified with much
ceremony, fattened and prepared for a
sacrifice
,
at their
feast
of the
passover
, as a
substitute
for the
paschal
lamb. This
horrid tale, which
should
have been
despised
for its
absurdity
and inhumanity,
the Dey affected to credit. He
appointed
several
Mahometan
priests
to
search
the habitations of the Jews,
immediately
before the
feast
of the
passover
,
who,
discovering
some
bitter herbs and
other
customary
preparations for the
festival
,
affected to have found
sufficient
evidence
against
them; and the mob of
Algiers, mad with rage and perhaps
inflamed
by the
usurious
exactions of
particular
Jews,
rushed
on
furiously
to pillage
and
destroy
the wretched
descendants
of
Jacob. Two
houses
were
demolished
, and
several
Jews
assassinated
before the arrival
of the Dey's guards, who quickly
dispersed
this outrageous rabble. The Dey, who
desired
nothing
less
than the
destruction
of
so
useful
a people, was
soon
appeased
by a large
present
, and declared them
innocent: and,
such
is the power of
despotic
governments, that the Jews
were
soon
received into general
favour
;
and the very men, who, the day
before, proceeded to
destroy
the whole
race, now
saw
, with tame inaction,
several
of their fellows executed for the
attempt
.

The arrival of other American Captives
.
Returning
from a jaunt
into the city, I was immediately
commanded
to retire to my room, and not to
quit it, till further orders, which it was
impracticable to do, as the doors were
sastened
upon me. The next morning, my
provisions
were brought me, and the
doors again carefully
secured
.
Surprised
at this
imprisonment
, I
passed
many
restless
hours in recurring to my
past
conduct
,
and perplexing
myself
in
searching
for
some
inadvertent offence, or in
dreadful
apprehension
,
lest
the
present
imprisonment
should
be a prelude to future and
Q 2
more
severe
punishment
. The
stone
quarry
came to my imagination in all its
horrours
,
and the frowns of Abdel Melic again
pierced my
soul
. I attempted in vain to
obtain from the
slave
, who brought me
provisions
, the
cause
of my confinement.
He was probably ignorant; my
solicitations
were uniformly
answered
by a
melancholy
shake
of the head. The
next day, the director of the
hospital
appeared
.
To him I applied with great
earnestness
; but all the information he
would give was, that it was by the Dey's
order I was confined; and that he, with
the
physicians
and my friend the Mollah,
were
using
all their influence to obtain
my
release
. He
counselled
me to
amuse
myself
in preparing and
compounding
drugs, and
promised
to
see
me again,
as
soon
as he could bring any good news.
About a week after, an officer of the court,
with a city judge, entered my apartment,
and informed me of the
cause
of my
imprisonment
.
From them I learned, that
several
American
vessels
had been
captured
;
and, it was
suspected
, I had been
conversing
with my countrymen; and,
from my
superiour
knowledge of the
country
,
I might
advise
them how to
escape
.
If a man is
desirous
to know how he loves
his country, let him go far from home; if
to know how he loves his countrymen, let
him be with them in
misery
in a
strange
land. I
wish
not to make a vain
display
of
my
patriotism
, but I will
say
, that my own
misfortunes, upon this intelligence, were
so
absorbed
in
those
of my unfortunate
fellow
citizens, thus delivered over to chains
and torment, many of them perhaps
separated
from the
tenderest
domestic
connexions
and homes of
ease
, that, I
thought, I could again have willingly
endured
the
lashes
of the
slave
driver, and
sink
myself
beneath the burthens of
slavery
,
to have
saved
them from an Algerine
captivity. I could readily
assure
the
Dey's officers, that I had not
conversed
with my
miserable
countrymen; but,
while I
spake
, the idea of embracing a
fellow citizen, a brother
christian
,
perhaps
some
one, who came from the
same
state
, or had been in the
same
town, or
seen
my dear parents,
passed
in rapid
succession
,
and I was determined, betide what
would, to
seek
them the
first
opportunity.
We were
soon
joined by the Mollah, who
repeatedly
assured
my examiners, that,
though an infidel, I might be believed.
By his
solicitation
, I was to be
released
;
but not until I would bind
myself
by a
solemn
oath,
administered
after the
christian
manner, that I would never
speak
to
any of the American
slaves
. When this
oath was
proposed
, I doubted whether to
take it; but, recollecting that, if I did
not, I
should
be equally debarred from
seeing
them, and
suffer
a grievous
confinement
,
which could do them no
service
,
I
consented
and bound
myself
never
directly or indirectly to attempt to
visit
or
converse
with my fellow citizens in
slavery
.
It was, at the
same
time,
intimated
to me, that for the breach of this oath
I might expect to be impaled alive.
Often, when I have drawn near the
places of their confinement and labours,
I have regretted my
submitting
to this
oath, and once was
almost
tempted to
break it, at
seeing
Captain O`Brien at
some
distance
.

.
After
I had taken this oath,
the officers departed, and I was liberated.
I was now more cautious in my rambles,
avoided the notice of the
Mussulmen
inhabitants
,
and made more frequent
visits
to that part of the city, inhabited by
Jews and foreigners.
Refreshing
myself
with a
glass
of
sherbet
in an inferiour
room, I was
accosted
by an old man, in
mean attire, with a pack of handkerchiefs
and
some
remnants of
silk
and
muslins
on his back. He
asked
me, if I was not
the learned
slave
, and
requested
me to
visit
a
sick
son
. I immediately
resolved
togo with him; rejoicing that Providence,
in my low
estate
, had left me the power
to be charitable. We
traversed
several
streets
and
stopped
at the door of a
house
, which, in appearance, well
suited
my conductor. It had but two windows
towards the
street
, and
those
were
closed
up with rough boards, the cracks of which
were
stuffed
with rags and
straw
. My
conductor looked very
cautiously
about,
and then, taking a key from his pocket,
opened the door. We
passed
a dark
entry
,
and, I
confess
, I
shuddered
, as the
door
closed
upon me, reflecting that,
perhaps
,
this man was employed to decoy
me to
some
secret
place, in order to
assassinate
me, by the direction of my
superiours
,
who might
wish
to
destroy
me in
this
secret
manner. But I had but little
time for
these
gloomy reflections; for,
opening another door, I was
startled
with
a blaze of light, let into apartments
splendidly
furnished
. My conductor now
assumed
an air of importance,
requested
me to
repose
myself
on a
silken
couch,
and retired. A young lady, who was
veiled, of a graceful
person
and
pleasing
address
,
soon
brought a plate of
sweetmeats
and a bottle of excellent wine.
The old man
soon
reappeared; but,
so
changed in his habit and appearance,
I could
scarce
recognize him. He was
now arrayed in drawers of the
finest
linen
,
an embroidered
vest
, and
loose
gown
of the
richest
Persian
silk
. He
smiled
at
my
surprise
,
shook
me by the hand, and
told me that he was a Jew;
assuring
me,
that he was with his brethren under the
protection of the Dey. The outward
appearance of his
house
, and the
meanness
of his attire abroad were, he
said
,
necessary
to avoid envy and
suspicion
.
But come,
said
he, I know all about you;
I can confide in you. Come
refresh
yourself
with a
glass
of this wine;
neither
Moses
nor your
Messiah
forbid the
use
of it. We ate of the collation,
drank our wine liberally; and then he
introduced
me to his
son
, whom I found
labouring under a violent ague. I
administered
some
sudorifics
, and left
direction
for the future treatment of my
patient
.
Upon my departure, the Jew put
a zequin into my hand, and made me
promise
to
visit
his
son
again;
requesting
me to
seat
myself
in the place, he had
found me, at the
same
hour, the next
day but one afterwards; and, in
passing
through the dark entry, conjured me not
to mention his
domestic
style
of living.
The name of this Jew was Adonah Ben
Benjamin. I
visited
his
son
, according
to appointment, and found him nearly
restored
to health. The father and
son
both
expressed
great gratitude; but the
former told me he would not pay me for
this
visit
in
silver
or gold, but with
something
more valuable, by his advice.
Come and
see
me
sometimes
; I know
Vol. II. R
this people well, and may render you
more
service
than you expect. I
afterwards
visited
this Jew frequently, and
from him obtained much information.
He told me, in much confidence, that
soon
after I was taken, a Jew and two
Algerines made a tour of the United
States, and
sent
home an accurate account
of the American commerce; and that
the Dey was
so
impressed
with the idea of
our wealth, that he would never permit
the American
slaves
to be
ransomed
under
a large premium, which
must
be
accompanied
with the
usual
presents
, as a
purchase
of peace, and an annual tribute.
Expressing
my anxiety to recover my
freedom, he
advised
me to write to
some
of the American agents in Europe. I
accordingly
addressed
a letter to William
Carmichael,
Esq
; charge des affairs from
the United States, at the court of
Madrid
,
representing
my deplorable
circumstances
,
and the
miserable
estate
of my
fellow
prisoners
; praying the
interference
of our government,
stating
the
probable mode of
access
to the Dey, and
enclosing
a letter to my parents. This
my friend, the Jew,
promised
to convey;
but, as I never received any
answer
from
Mr. Carmichael, and my letters never
found the way to my friends; I conclude,
from the known humanity of that
gentleman
,
my letters
miscarried
.
Some time after, I heard that the
United
States had made application, through
Mr. Lamb, for the redemption of their
citizens, and I had hopes of liberty;
intending
,
if that gentleman
succeeded
in
his negotiations, to claim my right to be
ransomed
, as an American citizen, but
his
proposals
were
scouted
with
contempt
.
I have
sometimes
heard this
gentleman
censured
for failing to
accomplish
the object of his
mission
, but very
unjustly
; as I well remember that I, who
was much
interested
in his
success
, never
blamed him at the time; and, I know,
the
ransom
, he offered the Dey, was
ridiculed
in the common coffee
houses
, as
extremely pitiful. The few Algerines,
I
conversed
with, affected to
represent
it
as
insulting
. It was reported, that he
was empowered to offer only two
hundred
dollars per head for each
prisoner
indiscriminately
, when the common price
was four
thousand
dollars per head for a
captain of a
vessel
, and one
thousand
four
hundred for a common fore
mast
sailor
.
When this
unsuccessful
attempt failed,
the
prisoners
were treated with greater
severity
;
doubtless
with a
design
to
affright
the Americans into terms, more
advantageous to the Dey.
Finding my hopes of
relcase
from the
applications of my country to
sade
, I
consulted
the friendly Jew, who
advised
me to endeavour to pay my own
ransom
,
which, he
said
, might be effected with my
savings
from my practice by the
mediation
of a rich Jew, his relation. I
accordingly
put all my
savings
into Adonah
Ben Benjamin's hands, which amounted
to two hundred and eighty dollars, and
resolved
to add to it all I could procure.
To this intent I hoarded up all I could
obtain; denying
myself
the
slender
refreshments
of bathing and cooling
liquors
,
to which I had been for
some
time
accustomed
. The benevolent Hebrew,
promising
that, when I had attained the
sum
requisite
, within two or three
hundred
dollars, he
himself
would advance
the remainder, no
miser
was ever more
engaged than I to
increase
my
store
.
After a tedious interval, my
prospects
brightened
surprisingly
. Some fortunate
operations, I performed, obtained me
valuable
presents
; one to the amount of
fifty dollars. My
stock
, in the Jew's
hands, had
increased
to nine hundred
dollars; and, to add to my good fortune,
the Jew told me, in great confidence, that,
R 2
from the
pleasing
account of the United
States, which I had given him, for I
always
spake
of the privileges of my native
land with fervour, he was determined to
remove with his family thither. He
said
he would make up the deficiency in my
ransom
, and
send
me home by the
first
European
vessel
, with letters to a Mr.
Lopez, a Jew, who, he
said
, lived in
Rhode
Island
or
Massachusetts
, to whom
he had a recommendation from a relation,
who had been in America. To Mr.
Lopez
he intended to confign his property.
He accordingly procured his friend,
whose
name I did not then learn, to agree about
my
ransom
. He concluded the contract
at two
thousand
dollars. My friends in
the
hospital
expressed
sorrow
at parting
with me; and making me
some
pecuniary
presents
, I immediately added them to
my
stock
, in the hands of the Jew. In
order to
lessen
the price of my
ransom
,
the contractor had told my
master
that
he was to advance the money, and take
my word to remit it, upon my return to
my friends. This
story
I confirmed. I
went to the Jew's
house
, who
honestly
produced all my
savings
; we counted
them together, and he added the
remainder
,
tying the money up in two large bags.
We
spent
a happy hour, over a bottle of
his
best
wine: I, in anticipating the
pleasure
my parents and friends would receive
in recovering their
son
, who was
lost
, and
the Jew in framing plans of commerce in
the United States, and in the enjoyment
of his riches in a country, where no
despot
should
force from him his
honest
gains; and, what added to my enjoyment,
was the information that a
vessel
was to
sail
for Gibraltar in two days, in which,
he
assured
me, he would procure me a
passage
. I returned to the
hospital
,
exulting
in my happy
prospects
. I was
quite
beside
myself
with joy. I capered
and danced as merrily, as my youthful
acquaintance
at a
husking
. Sometimes I
would be
lost
in thought, and then
burst
suddenly
into loud laughter. The next
day towards evening, I
hasted
to the
house
of my friend the Jew, to
see
if he had
engaged
my
passage
, and to gratify
myself
with
conversing
upon my native land.
Being intimate in the family, I was
entrusted
with a key of the front door. I
opened it
hastily
, and
passing
the entry,
knocked for admittance at the inner door,
which was
soon
opened. But,
instead
of
the
accustomed
splendour
, all was
gloomy
;
the windows darkened, and the
family
;
in tears. Poor Adonah Ben
Benjamin
had, that morning, been
struck
with
an apoplexy, and
slept
with his fathers.
I
soon
retired as
sincere
a mourner as the
nearest
kindred. I had indeed more
reason
to mourn than I conceived; for,
upon
applying to his
son
for his
assistance
in
perfecting my freedom, which his good
father
had
so
happily begun, he
prosessed
the
utmost
ignorance of the whole
transaction
;
declared that he did not know the
name of the agent, his father had
employed
,
and gave no credit to my account of
the monies I had lodged with his father.
I
described
the bags. He cooly
answered
,
that the God of his father Abraham
had
blessed
his father Adonah with many
such
bags. I left him,
distracted
with
my
disappointment
. Sometimes I
determined
to relate the whole
story
to the
director
of the
hospital
, and apply for legal
redress
to a cadi; but the
specimen
I had
of an Algerine law
suit
deterred me. I
had been
so
inadvertent, as to
countenance
the
story
that a Jew was to advance
the whole
sum
for me. If I had been a
Mussulman
, I might have
attested
to my
story
; but a
slave
is never admitted as
an evidence in Algiers, the
West
Indies,
or the Southern States. The
disappointment
of my hopes were
soon
known in
the
hospital
, though the hand Adonah
Ben Benjamin had in the contract
remained
a
secret
. The artful Jew, who
had contracted for my
ransom
, fearing he
should
have to advance the money
himself
,
spread
a report that I was
immensely
rich in my own country. This coming
to the ears of my
master
, he
raised
my
ransom
to
six
thousand
dollars, which the
wily
Israelite
declining to pay, the
contract
was
dissolved
. From my
master
I
learned his name, and waited upon him,
hoping to obtain
some
evidence of
Adonah's
having received my money, at
least
so
far as to induce his
son
to
restore
it. But
the Jew
positively
declared that Adonah
never told him other, than that he was to
advance the
cash
himself
. Thus, from
the
brightest
hopes of freedom, I was
reduced
to
despair
; my money
lost
; and
my
ransom
raised
. I
bless
a merciful
God that I was
preserved
from the
desperate
folly of
suicide
. I never
attempted
my life; but, when I lay down, I
often
hoped that I might never awake again,
in this world of
misery
. I grew dejected
and my
flesh
wasted
. The
physicians
recommended a journey into the country,
which my
master
approved; for,
since
the
report of my wealth in my native land, he
viewed my life as valuable to him, as he
doubted not my friends would one day
ransom
me at an exorbitant premium.

.
The
director
soon
after
proposed
,
that I
should
attend
some
merchants
,
as a
surgeon
in a voyage and
journey to Medina, the burial, and
Mecca
the birth, place of the prophet
Mahomet
;
assuring
me, that I
should
be
treated with
respect
, and indeed find
some
agreeable companions on the tour, as
several
of the merchants were infidels, like
myself
, and that any monies I might
acquire
,
by itinerant practice,
should
be my
own. I accepted this
proposal
with
pleasure
,
and was
soon
leased
to two
Mussulman
merchants, who gave a kind of bond
for my
safe
return to my
master
. I had
cash
advanced me to
purchase
medicines,
and a
case
of
surgeon
's
instruments
, which
I was directed to
stow
in a large leather
wallet. I took a kind leave of my
patrons
in the
hospital
, who
bestowed
many
little
presents
of
sweetmeats
, dates,
and oranges. I waited upon the good
Mollah, who
presented
me with fifty
dollars
.
I have charity to believe that this
man, though an
apostate
, was
sincere
in
his faith in the Mahometan creed. He
pressed
my hand at parting, gave me
many
salutary
cautions, as to my conduct
during the voyage; and
said
, while the
tears
started
in his eyes, my friend, you
have
suffered
much
missortune
and
misery
in a
short
life; let me conjure you
not to add the torments of the future to
the
miseries
of the
present
world. But,
added he,
pausing
, who
shall
alter the
decrees
Vol. II. S
of God? I flatter
myself
, that
the
scales
of natal prejudice will yet fall
from your eyes, and that your name was
numbered among the faithful from all
eternity.
Our company
consisted
of two
Algerine
merchants, or factors, twenty pilgrims,
nine Jews, among whom was the
son
of
my
deceased
friend Adonah, and two
Greek traders from Chios, who carried
with them
several
bales of
silks
and a
quantity of
mastic
, to vend at
Scandaroon
,
Grand Cairo and Medina. We
took
passage
in a Xebec; and,
coasting
the African
shore
,
soon
passed
the
ruins
of antient Carthage, the Bay of
Tunis
;
and, weathering cape Bona, and
steering
south
easterly
, one morning hove
in
sight
of the
Island
of Malta, inhabited
by the knights of that name, who are
sworn
enemies of the Mahometan faith.
I could perceive, that the
sight
of this
island
gave a
sensible
alarm to the crew
and
passengers
. But the captain, or
rather
skipper
, who was a
blustering
,
rough renegado, affected great courage,
and
swore
that, if he had but one
cannon
on board, he would run down and
give a broad
side
to the infidel dogs. His
bravery was
soon
put to the
test
; for, as
the
son
arose
, we could
discern
plainly
an armed
vessel
bearing down upon us.
She overhauled us
fast
, and our
skipper
conjectured
she
bore the
Maltese
colours.
All hands were now
summoned
to get out
some
light
sails
, and
several
oars were put
out, at which the brave
skipper
tugged
as
lustily
as the
meanest
of us. When
the wind lulled and we gained of the
vessel
,
he would run upon the quarters of
the Xebec, and hollow; Come on,
you
christian
dogs, I am ready for you.
I have
some
doubts, whether the
vessel
ever noticed us. If
she
did,
she
despised
us; for
she
tacked and
stood
to the
south
west
. This was no
sooner
perceived by
our gallant commander, than he ordered
the Xebec to lay too, and
swore
, that
he would
pursue
the
uncircumcised
dogs,
and board them; but he
first
would
prudently
ask
the approbation of the
passengers
,
who
instantly
determined one and
all that their
business
was
such
, that they
must
insist
upon the captain's making his
best
way to port. The captain
consented
,
but not without much grumbling at
his misfortune, in
losing
so
fine a prize;
and declared that, when he landed his
passengers
, he would directly quit the
port and renew the
chase
. After a
smart
run, we dropt anchor in the port of
Alexandria
,
called by the Turks Scandarcon.
This is the
site
of the antient
Alexandria
,
founded by Alexander the great;
though its
present
appearance would not
induce an opinion of
so
magnificent a
founder. It lies not far from the
westermost
branch of the river Nile, by which,
in ancient day, it was
supplied
with
water
.
The antiquarian eye may
possibly
observe
, in the
scattered
fragments of
rocks, the
vestiges
of the ruins of its
antient
grandeur; but a vulgar traveller,
from the appearance of the harbour,
choked
with
sand
, the
miserable
buildings, and
more wretched inhabitants of the town,
would not be led to conclude that this was
the port, which
rose
triumphant on the
ruins of Tyre and Carthage. We here
hired camels; and, being joined by a
number of pilgrims and traders,
collected
from various parts of the Levant, we
proceeded towards Grand Cairo, the
present
capital of Egypt; and, after
travelling
three days, or rather three nights, for
we generally
reposed
in the heat of the
day, which is
severe
from one hour after
the
sun
's
rising
until it
sets
, we came to a
pretty town on the
west
bank of the Nile,
called Gize, and hence
passed
over on rafts
to the city of Grand Cairo, called by the
Turks Almizer; the
suburbs
of which
S 2
extend to the river, but the principal
town commences its proper boundaries,
at about three miles
east
of the Nile. I
was now within a comparatively
short
distance
of two magnificent
curiosities
,
I had ever been
desirous
of beholding.
The city of
Jerusalem
was only about
five day's journey to the
south
east
, and I
had even caught a
glimpse
of the
pyramids
near Gize. I went with my
masters
and others to
see
a deep
stoned
pit,
in the
castle
, called
Joseph
's well; and
said
to have been dug by the direction of that
patriarch. I am not antiquarian enough
to know the particular
style
of
Joseph
's
well architecture; but the water was
sweet
and extremely cold. The Turks
say
that Potiphar's wife did not
cease
to
persecute
Joseph
with her love, after he
was
released
from
prison
, and advanced to
power; but the patriarch, being warned
by a dream to dig this well, and invite her
to drink of the water, which
she
had no
sooner
done, but one cup of it
so
effectually
cooled her
desires
, that
she
was ever
afterwards an eminent example of the
most
frigid
chastity
. In Grand Cairo,
we were joined by many pilgrims from
Palestine
, and the adjacent countries.
The third day, our carivan, which
consisted
of three hundred camels and
dromedaries
,
set
out for Medina, under the
convey of a troop of Mamaluke guards,
a tawny, raw boned, ill clothed people.
Some of the merchants, and even pilgrims
made a
handsome
appearance in
person
,
dress
, and equipage. I was
myself
well
mounted upon a camel, and carried with
me only my leather wallet of drugs, which
I
dispensed
freely among the pilgrims;
my
masters
receiving the ordinary pay,
while I collected many
small
sums
, which
the gratitude of my patients added to the
usual
fee. We
passed
near the north
arm of the red
sea
, and then
pursued
our
journey
south
, until we
struck
the
same
arm again, near the place where the
learned Wortley Montague has
concluded
the
Israelites
, under the conduct
of
Moses
, effected their
passage
. The
breadth of the
sea
here is great, and the
waters deep and turbulent. The infidel
may
sneer
, if he
chooses
; but, for my own
part, I am convinced beyond a doubt,
that, if the
Israelites
passed
in this place,
it
must
have been by the miraculous
interposition
of a divine power. I could
not refrain from reflecting upon the
infatuated
temerity, which impelled the
Egygtian
king to follow them. Well does
the Latin poet exclaim;
Quem Deus vult
perdere, prius dementat
. We then
travelled
east
, until we came to a
small
village, called Tadah. Here we filled
many goat
skins
with water, and laded
our camels with them. In addition to
my wallet, I received two goat
skins
or
bags of water upon my camel. The
weight, this
useful
animal will carry, is
astonishing
; and the facility and
promptitude
,
with which he kneels to receive his
rider and burthen,
surprising
. We now
entered the confines of Arabia Petrea,
very aptly denominated the rocky
Arabia
;
for, journeying
south
east
, we
passed
over many ridges of mountains, which
appeared of
solid
rocks, while the vallies
and plains between them were
almost
a
quicksand
. Not a tree,
shrub
, or
vegetable
is to be
seen
. In
these
vallies, the
sun
poured intolerable day, and its
reflections
from the land were
insupportable
.
No
refreshing
breeze is here
felt. The intelligent traveller often fears
the
rising
of the wind, which blows
such
sultry
gales, that man and
beast
often
sink
beneath them, never to
rise
again or, when agitated into a
tempest
,
drive the
sand
with
such
tumultuous
violence
,
as to overwhelm whole caravans.
Such indeed were the
stories
told me, as
I
passed
these
dreary plains. The only
inconvenience, I
sustained
,
arose
from
the
intense
heat of the
sun
, and the chills
of the night, which our thin garments
were not calculated to exclude. On the
third day, after we left Tadah, the water,
which we
transported
on our camels, was
nearly expended.
These
extraordinary
animals had not drank but once,
since
our departure. Near the middle of the
fourth day, I
observed
our camels
snuff
the air, and
soon
set
off in a
brisk
trot,
and
just
before night brought us to
water
.
This was contained in only one
deep well, dug, like a
reversed
pyramid,
with
steps
to
descend
on every
side
, to
the depth of one hundred feet; yet the
sagacity
of the camel had
discovered
this
water at perhaps twenty miles
distance
.
So my fellow travellers
asserted
; but I
have
since
thought, whether
these
camels,
from frequently
passing
this
desert
country
,
did not
discover
their approach to
water, rather from the eye, noting familiar
objects, than the actual
scenting
the water
itself
. A
horse
that has journeyed the
whole day, will quicken his
step
at night,
when, upon a familiar road, within
some
miles of an
accustomed
stable
. Our
escort
delighted in the marvellous. Many
a dreadful
story
did they tell of
poisonous
winds and overwhelming
sands
;
and of the
sierce
wandering Arabs, who
captured whole caravans, and eat their
prisoners
. Many a bloody battle had
they fought with this cruel banditti, in
which, according to their narratives, they
always came off conquerours.
Frequently
were we alarmed, to be in
readiness
to combat their
savage
free booters;
though I never
saw
but two of the
wild Arabs, in the whole of our journey.
They joined us at a little village,
east
of
Islamboul
, and
accosted
us with great
civility
.
They were
dressed
in blue frocks,
girded round the
waste
with
particoloured
sashes
, in which were
stuck
a
pistol
and a long knife. Their legs were bare,
and
sheepskin
caps covered their heads.
Their complexions were
sallow
, but their
garments and
persons
were clean.
Indeed
,
their
dress
and
address
evinced them
to be of a more civilized race than our
guards, who affected to treat them with
lofty hauteur; and, when they departed,
assured
us that they were
spies
, and that an
attack from their countrymen might now
be apprehended with certainty; if,
said
the leader of our
escort
, they are not
terrified
by finding you under our
protection
.

The Author is
blessed
with the Sight and
Touch of a
most
boly Mabometan Saint
.
When
we were within one
day's journey of Medina, we halted for a
longer time than
usual
;
occasioned
, as I
found, by the arrival of a
most
holy
saint
. As I had never
seen
a
saint
,
being
bred, in a land, where even the
relics
of
these
holy men are not
preserved
,
for I believe all New England cannot
produce
so
much as a
saint
's rotten tooth
or toe nail, I was
solicitous
to
see
and
converse
with this
blessed
personage
. I
soon
discovered
him, in the
midst
of
about
fifty pilgrims,
some
of whom were
devoutly touching their foreheads with
Vol. II. T
the hem of his garment, while others,
still
more devout,
prostrated
themselves
on
the ground, and
kissed
the prints of his
footsteps
in the
sand
. Though I was
assured
,
that he was filled with divine love,
and conferred felicity on all, who touched
him; yet, to outward appearance, he was
the
most
disgusting
, contemptible object,
I had ever
seen
. Figure to
yourselves
,
my readers, a little decrepit, old man,
made
shorter
by
stooping
, with a
countenance
,
which exhibited a vacant
stare
, his
head bald, his finger and toe nails as long
as hawks' claws, his attire
squalid
, his face,
neck, arms, and legs begrimed with dirt
and
swarming
with vermin, and you will
have
some
saint
idea of this
Mussulman
saint
. As I was too
reasonable
to expect
that
holiness
existed
in a man's exteriour,
I waited to hear him
speak
; anticipating,
from his lips, the
profoundest
wisdom
,
delivered in the honied accents of the
saints
in
bliss
. At length he
spake
; and
his
speech
betrayed him, a mere idiot.
While this
astonished
me, it
raised
the
respect
of his admirers, who
estimated
his
fanctity in an
inverse
ratio to the
weakness
of his intellects. If they could have
ascertained
, that he was born an idiot,
verily believe, they would have adored
him; for the Mahometans are taught by
their alcoran, that the
souls
of
saints
are
often lodged in the bodies of idiots
and
these
pious
souls
, being
so
intent on
the joys of
paradise
, is the true
reason
that the actions of their bodies are
so
little
suited
to the manners of this world.
This
saint
however did not
aspire
to the
sanctity
of a genuine idiot; though,
fancy, his
modesty
injured his
prefement
,
for he certainly had very fair
pretensions
.
It was
resolved
, that the
homan
should
go with us; and, to my
gremortification
and
disgust
, he was
mouned
behind me on the
same
camel; my
Mahometan friends probably conceived
that he would
so
far communicate his
sanctity
by contact, as that it might affect
my
conversion
to their faith. Whatever
were their faith. Whatever
were their motives, in the embraces of this
nauseous
being, with the people
prostrating
themselves
in reverence on each
side
, I
made my entry into the city of Medina.

the City of Medina:
Description
of the Prophet's Tomb, and
principal
Mosque
.
Medina
Tadlardh,
erroneously
called Medina Talmabi, is
situated
in Arabia
Deserta
, about forty five miles
east
from the borders of the red
sea
. To
this place, as has been before related, the
prophet fled, when driven from Mecca his
birth place; and here he was buried, and
his remains
still
are
preserved
, in a
silver
coffin, ornamented with a golden
crescent
,
enriched with jewels, covered with cloth
of gold,
supported
upon
silver
tassels
, and
shadowed
by a canopy, embroidered with
T 2
silk
and gold thread upon
silver
tissue
.
This canopy is renewed annually, by the
bashaw
of Egypt; though other
bashaws
,
and great men among the Turks, often
assist
in the
expense
, or augment the value
of the yearly
present
, by
silver
lamps and
other ornaments. The whole are
contained
in a magnificent
mosque
, in which
are
suspended
innumerable gold and
silver
lamps,
some
of which are kept
continually
burning, and all are lighted on
certain
public
occasions
; and even upon
the approach of
some
dignified pilgrim.
I had not acquired
sufficient
holiness
, from
my
blessed
companion, to be permitted to
enter this
sanctified
building. The
Arabians
are
profusely
extravagant, in the
titles
they
bestow
on the city of Medina;
calling it the
most
holy,
most
renowned,
most
excellent city; the
sanctuary
of the
blessed
fugitive; model of the refulgent
city in the
celestial
paradise
; and
some
of the great vulgar
suppose
, that when
the world
shall
be
destroyed
, this city,
with the prophet's remains, will be
transported
by angels, with all its inhabitants,
to
paradise
. We tarried there but a few
hours, as the great object of the devotions
of the pilgrims was Mecca.
Pilgrimages
are performed to both places; but
those
to Medina are not
indispensably
necessary
; being directed by the book of
the companions of the
apostles
, while
those
to Mecca are enjoined by the
alcoran
itself
. The former are
supposed
meritorious, the latter
necessary
to
salvation
.
I had the
curiosity
to inquire
respecting
the prophet's coffin being
suspended
in the air by a load
stone
, and
was
assured
that this was a mere
christian
obloquy, as no
pretensions
of any
such
suspension
were ever made.

The Author
visits
Mecca:
Description
of
the Al Kaaba, or
House
of God
.
Being
freed from my
blessed
companion, I had an agreeable journey
from Medina to Mecca, which is the
most
antient city in all Arabia;
situated
about
two hundred miles
south
east
of Medina,
twenty one degrees and forty five minutes
north latitude, and one hundred and
sixteen
degrees
east
longitude, from Philadelphia,
according to late American calculations. I
saw
the great
mosque
in the centre of
Mecca
,
which it is
said
, far
surpasses
in grandeur
that of Sancta Sophia in
Constantinople
. It
certainly is a very
august
building, the
roof of which is refulgent; but even the
inhabitants
smiled
at my credulity, when
I
observed
that I had read it was covered
with plated gold. This
mosque
contains
within its limits the grand object of the
Mussulman
's pilgrimage; the
Al Kaaba
,
or
house
of God,
said
to have been built
by the hands of the patriarch Abraham;
to confirm which the Arabian
priests
shew
a black
stone
, upon which they
say
Abraham laid his
son
Isaac
, when he had
bound him in preparation for his
intended
sacrifice
. This
stone
and building
were great objects of veneration, before
the
mission
of the prophet, and he artfully
availed
himself
of this popular prejudice,
in rendering the
highest
respect
to the
holy
house
, in his life time, and
enjoining
upon his followers, without
distinction
among males, to
visit
it once in their
lives. The advent of the prophet was
said
to be announced from the four
corners
of the
house
, which exhibit the four
cardinal points. Few pilgrims are
permitted
to enter this
sacred
, venerable
building; but, after travelling,
some
of
them perhaps a
thousand
miles, they are
content to
prostrate
themselves
in the
courts, which
surround
it. Few
Mahometans
perform this pilgrimage in
person
;
those
who do are highly
respected
.
This pilgrimage was enjoined, by the
prophet, to be performed in
person
; but,
when he laid this injunction, it is not
probable he anticipated the
extensive
spread
of his doctrines. So long as his
disciples
were limited by the boundaries
of Arabia, or had only extended
themselves
over a part of Syria, this pious
journey was practicable and
easy
; out,
when the
crescent
rose
triumphant on the
sea
coast
, and
most
of the interiour of
Africa
,
when it
shone
with
splendour
in
Persia
, Tartary, and Turkey, and even
adorned the
Moorish
minarit in Spain,
actual pilgrimage was deemed
impracticable
;
and the faithful were allowed to
visit
the Kaaba by deputy. The
ingenuity
of more modern times has alleviated
this religious burthen
still
further, by
allowing
the deputy to
substitute
other
attornies
under him. Thus for example:
the pious
Mussulman
in Belgrade will
employ a friend at
Constantinople
, who
will empower another friend at
Scandaroon
to procure a confidential friend at
Grand Cairo to go in the name of him at
Belgrade, and perform his pilgrimage to
Mecca. Certificates of
these
several
substitutions
are
preserved
, and the lazy
Mussulman
hopes by this
finesse
to reap
the rewards of the faithful in
paradise
.

The Author returns to Scandaroon: Finds
Adonah's Son
sick
: His Contrition: Is
restored
to Health
.
After
tarrying
sixteen
days
at Mecca, during which time my
masters
fasted
, prayed, performed their devotions
at the Kaaba, and
sold
their merchandize,
we retraced the
same
rout to Scandaroon.
Here we found the
son
of Adonah Ben
Benjamin, who had been detained in this
place by
sickness
,
so
weakened from a
tedious
slow
fever that his life was
despaired
of. He
expressed
great joy, at our
return
,
and begged my
professional
assistance
;
assuring
me, that he
esteemed
his
present
disorder
a judicial
punishment
from the
God of his fathers, for the injury he had
done me; candidly
confessing
, that he
knew of his father's having received my
money, which he would
restore
upon our
return to Algiers, if I would effect his
recovery
.
He prevailed upon my
masters
that I
should
abide in the
house
with
him, during their
absence
, as they
were engaged upon a trading tour to a
place called Ging, upon the river Nile.
I exerted all my
skill
, both as a
physician
and
nurse
. Perhaps my
attention
in the latter capacity,
assisted
by his
youth, was of more
service
than my
prescriptions
.
Be that as it may, he
recovered
rapidly, and in ten days was able to
walk the
streets
; but I could not help
noticing with
sorrow
, that as his
strength
increased
, his gratitude and
promises
to
refund my money
decreased
.

The Gratitude of a Jew
.
One
day, walking on the
beach, the Jew looked me
steadily
in the
face; and, laying his hand upon my
shoulder
,
said
I owe you my life, I owe you
money, which you cannot oblige me to
pay. You think, a Jew will always
deceive
in money matters. You are
mistaken
.
You
shall
not wait for your pay in
Algiers; I will pay you here in
Alexandria
.
I owe you one
thousand
dollars on
my father's account. Now, what do you
demand for
restoring
me to health?
Nothing replied I, overjoyed at his
probity
;
restore
me my money, and you are
welcome to my
services
. This
must
not
be,
said
the
son
of Adonah, I have done
wickedly, but mean not only to pay you,
but
satisfy
my own
conscience
. I will
allow you in addition to the one
thousand
dollars, two
thousand
more for your
assistance
,
as a
physician
; and then will
advance
three
thousand
more, which I will
take your word to repay me, when you
are able. I was
astonished
. I
seized
his
hand and felt his
pulse
, to
discover
if he
was not delirious. His
pulse
were
regular
,
and I knew his ability to perform his
promise
. We will meet here on the
morrow, and I will pay you. I met him
the next day, and he was not ready to
make payment. I now began to doubt
his
promises
, and blame
myself
for the
delusions
of hope. By his appointment I
met him the third day, on a retired part of
the beach,
westward
from the port. We
now
saw
a man approaching us. That
man,
said
the Jew, will pay you. You
well
understand
, my friend, that your
ransom
is fixed at
six
thousand
dollars.
Now, whoever gives you your liberty,
really pays you that
sum
. I have
engaged
the
person
, who is approaching, and
who is the
master
of a
small
vessel
, to
transport
you to Gibraltar, whence you
may find your way home. The man now
joined us and confirmed the words of the
Jew, for whom he
professed
a great
friendship
.
It was concluded, that I
should
come to that
spot
immediately after dark,
where I
should
find a
small
boat waiting
to carry me on board the
vessel
. The
master
of the
vessel
declaring, that he run
a great
risk
, in
assisting
in my
escape
;
but was willing to do it out of
commiseration
for me, and
friendship
for the Jew;
and reminded me, that I had better pack up
all my property, and bring it with me. I
hastened
home with the Jew, and
collected
all the property I could with propriety
call my own; which
consisted
of a few
clothes, and to the amount of three
hundred
and twenty dollars in
cash
. As
soon
as it was dark, the Jew accompanied me
to the beach, and then took an
affectionate
leave of me,
presenting
me with the
value of ten dollars, as a loan, gravely
remarking
,
that now I owed him three
thousand
and ten dollars, which he hoped I
would
transport
to him as
soon
as I
arrived
in America. The Jew quitted me,
and I
soon
discovered
the approach of
the boat, which I
stept
into with a light
heart, congratulating
myself
, that I was
again
A FREE MAN. The boat
soon
rowed
along
side
of a
vessel
, that was laying
to for us. I jumped on board, and was
directly
seized
by two men, who bound
me and hurried me below deck; and,
after
robbing me of all my property, left
me in the dark to my own reflections. I
had been
so
long the
sport
of cruel fortune,
that
these
were not
so
severe
, as my
sympathising
readers may conjecture.
Repeated
misfortunes blunt
sensibility
. I
U 2
perceived that I had been played a
villanous
trick, and exchanged a tolerable
slavery
, for one perhaps more
insupportable
;
but
should
have been perfectly
resigned
to my fate, if the dread of being
returned to Algiers and
suffering
the
dreadful
punishment
, already related, had
not
presented
itself
. In the morning, I
requested
to
see
the captain; and, by his
orders, was brought upon deck; to my
surprise
, it was not the
same
person
who
had decoyed me on board. I was
confounded
.
I intended to have
expostulated
;
but could I tell a
stranger
, a man,
who appeared a
Mussulman
by his garb,
that I was a runaway
slave
? While I was
perplexing
myself
what to
say
, the man,
who had decoyed me on board, appeared.
He was a
passenger
, and claimed me as his
slave
, having
purchased
me, as he
said
, for
four hundred zequins of a Jew, my
former
master
, and meant to carry me with
him to Tunis. I was now awakened to
all the horrours of my
situation
. I
dared
not irritate my new
master
by
contradictions
,
and
acquiesced
in his
story
in
dumb
despair
. On the eighth day, after
we departed from Scandaroon, the
vessel
made cape Bona, and expected
soon
to
anchor in the port of Tunis. My
master
had a
Portuguese
slave
on board, who
slept
in the birth with me. He
spoke
a
little broken
English
, having been
formerly
a
sailor
on board a
vessel
of that
nation. He gave me the
most
alarming
apprehensions
of the cruelty of our
master
,
but flattered me by
saying
that the
Tunise
in general were more mild with
their
slaves
than the Algerines, and
allowed
a freer
intercourse
with the European
merchants; and, by their interference,
we might obtain our liberty. While my
fellow
slave
slept
, I lay agonizing with
the dread of entering the port of Tunis.
Often did I
wish
that
some
friendly rock
or kindly leak would
sink
me, and my
misfortunes, in perpetual oblivion; and
I was nigh being gratified in my
desperate
wishes
; for, the
same
night, a
tremendous
storm
arose
, and the gale
struck
us with
such
violence, that our
sails
were
instantly
flittered into rags. We could
not
shew
a yard of
canvass
, and were
obliged
to
scud
under bare poles. The
night was
excessively
dark; and, to
increase
our
distress
, our
ballast
shifted
and
we were obliged to cut away our
masts
by the board, to
save
us from foundering.
The
vessel
righted, but being
strong
and
light, and the hatchways being well
secured
,
our captain was only fearful of
being driven on
some
christian
coast
.
The next night, the wind lulled; and
the morning after, the
sun
arose
clear, and
we found
ourselves
off the
coast
of
Sardinia
,
and within gun
shot
of an armed
vessel
. She proved to be a
Portuguese
frigate. To the
confusion
and
dismay
of
our captain and
passenger
, and to the great
joy of
myself
and fellow
slave
. The
frigate
hoisted
her colours, manned her boats,
and boarded us. No
sooner
was his
national
flag
displayed
, than the overjoyed
Portuguese
ran below and liberated me
from my fetters, hugged me in raptures,
and hauling me upon deck, the
first
man
we met was our
master
, whom he
saluted
with a kick, and then
spit
in his face. I
must
confess
that this
reverse
of fortune
made me feel for the wretched
Mussulman
,
who
stood
quivering with
apprehensions
of
instant
death; nor could I refrain
from preventing the
Portuguese
from
avenging
himself
for the cruelties, he had
suffered
, under this barbarian. The boats
soon
boarded us, and
secured
the
captain
and crew, whom they treated with
as much bitter contempt, as my fellow had
exercised
toward our late
master
. This
poor fellow
soon
introduced me to his
countrymen, with a brief account of my
country and misfortunes.

Argument.
Conclusion
.
The
Portuguese
officers
treated
me with
politeness
; and, when they
were rifling the
vessel
,
requested
me to
select
my property from the plunder. I
was then
sent
on board the frigate. The
captain
expressed
much joy, at being the
means of my deliverance, and told me,
that the
Portuguese
had a
sincere
regard
for the Americans; and that he had
received
express
orders to protect our
commerce
from the Barbary
corsairs
. The
prisoners
were brought on board and
confined below; and, after every thing
valuable was taken from the prize, the
ship
stood
for the
straits
of Gibraltar,
leaving a boat to fire the
Tunise
vessel
.
I never received more civility than from
the officers of this frigate. In compliment
to them, I was obliged to throw my
Mahometan
dress
over the
ship
's
side
; for
they
furnished
me with every
necessary
,
and many ornamental articles of
European
clothing. The
surgeon
was
particularly
attentive. I lent him
some
assistance
among the
sick
, his mate being unwell;
and, among other
presents
, he gave me a
handsome
pocket
case
of
surgical
instruments
.
After a
pleasant
voyage, we
anchored
in port Logos, in the
southern
extremity of Portugal. Here I received
the agreeable intelligence, that the
United
States were about commencing a
treaty
with the Dey of Algiers, by the
agency
of
Joseph
Donaldson
, jun.
Esq
; which
would liberate my unhappy fellow
citizens
,
and
secure
the American commerce
from future depredations. Without
landing, I had the good fortune to
obtain
a
passage
on board an
English
merchantman
,
bound for
Bristol
, Captain
Joseph
Joceline, commander. We had
a
prosperous
voyage to the land's end;
and, very fortunately for me,
just
off the
little
isle
of Lundy,
spake
with a
brigantine
,
bound to
Chesapeak
Bay, Captain
John Harris, commander. In thirty
two days, we made Cape Charles, the
north chop of the
Chesapeak
, and I
prevailed
upon the captain to
set
me on
shore
; and, on the third day of May,
one
thousand
seven
hundred and ninety
five, I landed in my native country, after
an
absence
of
seven
years and one month;
about
six
years of which I had been a
slave
. I
purchased
a
horse
, and
hastened
home to my parents, who received me
as one
risen
from the dead. I
shall
not
attempt to
describe
their emotions, or my
own raptures. I had
suffered
hunger,
sickness
, fatigue,
insult
,
stripes
, wounds,
and every other cruel injury; and was
now under the roof of the
kindest
and
tenderest
of parents. I had been degraded to
a
slave
, and was now advanced to a citizen
of the
freest
country in the
universe
. I
had been
lost
to my parents, friends, and
country; and now found, in the
embraces
and congratulations of the former,
and the rights and protection of the latter,
a rich
compensation
for all
past
miseries
.
From
some
minutes I
preserved
, I
compiled
these
memoirs; and, by the
solicitations
of
some
respectable
friends, have
been induced to
submit
them to the
public
.
A long
disuse
of my native tongue,
will apologize to the learned reader for
any inaccuracies.
I now mean to unite
myself
to
some
amiable
woman, to
pursue
my practice, as
a
physician
; which, I hope, will be
attended
with more
success
than when
essayed
with the inexperience and
giddiness
of youth. To contribute cheerfully
to the
support
of our excellent
government
,
which I have learnt to adore, in
schools
of
despotism
; and thus
secure
to
myself
the enviable character of an
useful
physician
, a good father and worthy
FEDERAL citizen.
My ardent
wish
is, that my fellow
citizens
may profit by my misfortunes.
If they
peruse
these
pages with attention
they will perceive the
necessity
of uniting
our federal
strength
to enforce a due
respect
among other nations. Let us, one and
all, endeavour to
sustain
the general
government
.
Let no foreign
emissaries
inflame
us
against
one nation, by raking
into
the
ashes
of long
extinguished
enmity
or delude us into the extravagant
schemes
of another, by recurring to fancied
gratitude
.
Our
first
object is union among
ourselves
. For to no nation
besides
the
United States can that antient
saying
be
more emphatically applied; BY
UNITING
WE STAND, BY DIVIDING WE FALL.
