ELLEN HART.
CHAPTER I.
The bell in the tower of the `Old South'
church was tolling heavily and loud the strokes
for nine o'clock, as a Watchman came upon
his `beat on the corner of W  Place. It
was a cold, cloudy night, late in November,
and his large box-coat was closely buttoned
up to his throat and his winter cap drawn low
over his ears and forehead. With his rattle
hanging upon his wrist and a short club in
his grasp he began to pace his round into
Summer street. The wind came howling
through the cross avenues of the town
westward
,
causing the passengers on the walks to
bend low to it and with the cape of the cloak
shield their faces from its piercing effects.
The street lamps burned more brightly than
usual in the clear atmosphere, but at
intervals
,
agitated by the wind which found its way
through the frame of the lantern, would flicker
and cast dancing shadows across the streets
and along the side-walks. Ashy-hued clouds
were driving along the gloomy sky, opening
now and then to let a star shine through
for an instaut and then disappear. Few
persons
were in the streets and the hacks and
cabs that passed, went at a furious rate over
the icy ground, as if the drivers were willing
to exchange as soon as possible their bleak
elevation for a seat in the warm bar-room
adjoining
their `stand.'
The watchman passed half-way up the
`Place,' and mid-way met his comrade
advancing
,
as warmly muffled against the cold
as himself.
`A stiff night, Maxwell,' said his
companion
.
`It will shut up the harbor! I have not
known so cold a snap at this season for years,'
responded the other.
`The poor will feel it.'
`Yes; and rogues will keep in, for they are
most of them too ill-clad to stand this
weather
;'
answered Maxwell with a laugh.
`The keenest will only be abroad and we
must keep the better watch.'
`The cold will keep me stirring,' growled
the other. `It is worth a man's life to sit
down five minutes. He'd never get up again!
See how comfortabte it looks in that parlor!
It's the rich this world was made for after all.
Now, that man who lives there, because he is
rich, can stay at home with his family and
enjoy himself, while we, because we are poor
men, must leave our wives and children and
be abroad in such a night as this to watch his
house! This is a rich man's world, and poor
folks have no business in it.'
`You have no cause to complain,' said
Echardt
,
with a German accent, `for your
situation
is much better than that of thousands in
this city. To hundreds of poor devils you
and I are rich and envied! Look at that poor
man and his wife now with their little girl!'
and he pointed to a miserably clad man
carrying
on his shoulder fragments of some old
fence, followed by a woman, her feet incased
in an old pair of men's boots and dressed in a
thin ragged gown accompanied by a
barefooted
little child, both tottering under a load
of miserable fire-wood gathered in vacant lots,
and both looking, as doubtless they were, half
frozen to death. Maxwell turned and looked
after them as they went shivering past, one
behind the other, and then replied,
`You are right, Echardt. I am wrong to
complain. My lot is a good one. That might
have been me, my wife and my child! God's
mercies we all ought to be thankful for!'
`So we ought; and if every man who was
discontented would feel so, there would be less
complaining and a great deal more
happiness
.
It is not riches or a large fine house, or
a carriage and such things that make men
happy. We must carry our happiness about
with us in our bosoms. A contented spirit is
better than Jacob Astor's wealth. Now, much
as you envy Mr. Hart, who lives in this
elegant
house,' he said, glancing at the windows
of the handsome mansion, the lights within
reflecting a rich crimson glow through the
closely drawn curtains, speaking of domestic
comfort combined with elegance, taste and
wealth; `happy as you think he is, I have no
doubt if we both knew the truth, we should
find that he was very far from being as happy
as you or I.'
`Perhaps not,' answered the other; `but
there is a poor shivering creature who has
seated herself on the steps as if she would get
warmth by gazing into the warm-looking
windows
.
I must start her up, or she will freeze
to stone there. Poor thing!'
`And so many housesso many roomsso
many bedsso many fire-places with plenty
of room around them as there are in this great
city, and yet here is a poor woman who has to
wander the streets. It is a shame to human
nature!'
`It is so; but it has always been so and
always
will be so! Go on your rounds. I will
take care of her, Echart,' said Maxwell. The
other watchman then continued his walk,
beating his feet to keep the blood in
circulation
,
while Maxwell approached the woman
who had seated herself on the steps of the rich
man's house.
`Come, come, good woman! You must'nt
sit here,' he said in a firm but kind voice.
`Have you no home to go to?' She was clad
in a calico gown, an old handkerchief and a
wretched hood! By the light of a street lamp
he saw that her naked feet were thrust into an
old pair of hotel slippers. He could not see
her features. He repeated his question.
`No,' she answered in a faint voice.
`Then go with me to the watch-house. You
will find at least a fire and a cot there!'
He took her by the arm and was about to
lead her away from the step when a gentleman,
enveloped to the eyes in the folds of a
Spanish
cloak, came up and pausing said,
`What is the matter, Maxwell, for I
believe
this is you!'
`A poor woman, Mr. Hart, who was sitting
on your steps where she would soon have got
stiff. She says she has no home and I am
taking
her to the watch-house.'
`Please, sir, give me a little something?
asked the woman.
`You are always at your post, Maxwell.
That's right, never let the vagabonds be
about!'
`Please, sir.'
`I have nothing for you,' he answered
coldly
;
and passing her by he entered his
dwelling
,
while the watchman led off the poor
woma
.
This uncharitable person was a merchant of
eminence. His name was Henry Hart. He
had been the maker of his own fortune, and
lived in a style of magnificence
commensurate
with his income. He had accumulated
his wealth on the miser's principle, that
pennies
grew to pounds. He never gave away
money, he loved it for itself and for the
consideration
it gave him among men. He was
nevertheless liberal in expenditure where
himself
and his family were interested. He had
an excellent wife, both lovely and
accomplished
.
At the time he is now introduced to
the reader he had been sixteen years married,
and had five children, the eldest being a
lovely
girl of fifteen with every advantage of
education
.
But we wlll enter his parlor with him
and witness the domestic scene, the idea of
which excited the envy of the watchman.
The merchant threw aside his cloak and
hat and listened a moment in the hall to the
sound of the pleasant voices of his children
which reached his ears. He sighed.
`Let them be happy now! They know not
at what expense of peace of mind I purchased
for them this enjoyment.' Mr. Hart, though
uncharitable and unfeeling when called upon
to administer of his wealth to the necessities
of others, was a kind and affectionate father.
Those who knew him only in his family
regarded
him as a most excellent husband and
parent, and a kind, pleasant man. He was so
ndeed, wherever money was not concerned.
When this was the subject present, he knew
neither friendship nor affection. `Business'
was the magic word which covered a
thousand
acts that were far removed from charity,
or honesty. But so long as the world knew
not the selfish and unlawful springs of action
he cared not the result upon others. He was
a merciless landlord and a hard creditor. But
this was all in the way of `business!'
So he had gotten rich, and men respected
him because he had gotten rich. His wife
moved in the `set' that became his
pretensions
and they belonged to the fashionable and
gay world, they and their children.
But all is not prosperity that seems so. Four
years previous to the present time of our story
Mr. Hart had been placed in a very critical
situation for his credit, through the failure of
a House for which he had endorsed heavier
than he should have done. The
announcement
of their failure and the notification that
their several notes to the aggregate sum of
sixteen thousand dollars had become due with
three days grace were simultaneous. He had
not a quarter of the sum at command and had
only the day before invested in a railroad all
the money he had of his own besides much
he had borrowed of the banks. His credit as
a merchant was in danger; and a merchant's
credit is his life. He thought of no way of
raising the money but by mortgaging one of
his houses, and this he feared to do lest it
should subject his soundness to suspicion. At
length he thought of a merchant who had
retired
from business of whom he might
possibly
borrow twelve thousand dollars for a few
days. He applied to him, but this gentleman,
though very opulent was not able to oblige
him, and declined loaning his note on the plea
that he already had it on so much paper in
Bank.
`Then if he has it on so
much
, it will be of
little consequence whether it is on another
note or not,' said Mr. Hart to himself, as he
left his dwelling full of the most agonising
anticipations
of the blow about to fall upon his
good name. Suddenly a temptation rose up
in his mind! It was a temptation to make
use of the rich man's name by
forgery
. Mr.
Hart did not at once reject the thought, but as
he walked along dwelt upon it; and each
moment
the idea of obtaining relief in this way
grew stronger.
`It will not be a forgery,' he said to himself,
`for I have the
intention
to take it up' He
said he hardly knew whose notes his name
was on, he had endorsed so many! Then I
have no fear of detection! Before its
maturity
or he received a Bank notice, I should
pay and destroy it! I see no other
alternative
!
It must not be that the house of Henry
Hart fails for inability to meet a sudden
payment
of sixteen thousand dollars! In a few
days I can command twice this sum, and shall
I now be ruined for want of half of it.'
Mr. Hart was alone in his counting room.
Before him on the desk lay a note in his
handwriting
.
It read as follows
Boston
,
April 20, 1839.
$12,000.
`Thirty days from date for value received I
promise to pay Henry Hart, or order, twelve
thousand dollars.'
He stood for some time with his pen in his
hand looking at what he had written. His
face was pale; his lips firmly compressed.
Three several times he had dipped his pen into
the leaden standish by his arm and each time
hesitated to copy the signature from an old
letter which he had imitated closely on a sheet
of paper he had just torn up and thrown into
the grate.
`It is but a dash of the pen! and there is
really no crimeand certainly no danger!
Yet I do not like to do it. But there is no
other means of safety! I would die rather
than be protested in bank! I know I can
take it up and Mr. Stebbins will never be the
wiser for the use that has been made of his
name! It
must
be done!'
He drew the note before him and then with
a slow but firm hand copied accurately the
signature, `Robert Stebbins,' at the bottom of
the note!
`It is done,' he cried, dashing the pen upon
the floor and crushing it with his foot. He
cast sand upon the forged name, endorsed his
own upon the back of the note, and then tak
ing his hat went out. At a merchant's in
street he stopped and readily obtained a
signature
.
`Been selling property to old Stebbins, Mr.
Hart?' asked the merchant.
`Yes'he answered coloring, and thus
sealing
his forgery with a falsehood.
The note was discounted without question,
as Mr. Hart well knew it would be. Some
days before it matured he took it up; and
when it was placed in his hands he felt a
degree
of relief that he had been a stranger to
for many days. Crime, when the breast of
the criminal alone holds the secret, makes the
heart of man ill at ease. The danger was now
over and Mr. Hart that night slept soundly.
But the consequences of the act he had
been guilty of remained in its effects upon his
own moral feeling. This had become less
sensitive
;
and there was now no assurance that
in a parallel emergency he who had once
resorted
to unlawful means to extricate himself
would not do so again and again.
Up to this time, however, when we meet
him in his front-hall listening to the merry
voices of his children he had not a second
time yielded to the temptation; for tempted
since he had often times been in the
vicissitudes
of his extensive and complicated
business
to relieve himself in this way. His
affairs
were now outwardly prospering, but his
circumstances were far from being
prosperous
.
He had met with heavy losses and had
been very much embarrassed by unsuccessful
speculations. Nearly all his real estate had
been privately sacrificed to make good the
amounts he had drawn from his business
capital
to meet their losses; for he had sold
property
instead of resorting to false notes. The
recollection of the state of mental suffering
he had undergone while the forged note lay in
the Bank out of his hands, was fresh and
vivid, and led him to make any sacrifice
rather than subject himself again to these
distressing
fears of detection.
Such was the character and condition of
Mr. Henry Hart, the wealthy merchant,
whose supposed happiness awakened the envy
of the watchman. But we will not keep him
longer in the hall.
He opened the door and the scene that met
his eyes was one familiar to him but not so to
the reader. The room was the front one of
two large and lofty apartments connected by
folding doors, which in summer were always
open. They were now closed and an elegant
piano stood against the polished doors; at
which, as he entered, a beautiful young girl of
fifteen was seated,
not
playing but laughing
and talking with a handsome youth of
nineteen
or twenty, who was bending gracefully
over her.
In the centre of the parlor was a large
round table supporting a bronzed astral lamp,
which shed a rich, subdued, yet clear light
throughout the apartment. Beneath it around
the table were seven or eight boys and misses
under twelve, playing at a game called `Dr.
Busby,' with printed and beautifully colored
cards; and as Mr. Hart entered they were
shouting out with laughter all around for the
`Black-Eyed Lover.' It was a merry and
happy party of them, and every little heart
was overrunning with happiness. Two of the
children, a boy of eight and a little girl of six
years, were the children of the rich merchant,
the others were little visiters for the evening
A few feet removed from the table sat in a
velvet rocking chair a handsome and very
lady-like
person sewing white fur upon a child's
pelisse. She was about thirty-eight, and yet
was youthful in her appearance. Her form,
however, was slight, and her health was
evidently
delicate At intervals she would
suspend
her work and look at the children around
the table with smiling interest in their
amusement
.
Often she would be referred to by
some one of the little people as authority
for such, and such modes of playing the game,
when she would give her opinion with a grace
and kindness than won their hearts.
Mrs. Hart was only happy in her children!
The rich crimson drapery of the windows,
the costly mirrors, the gorgeous carpet, the
expensive furniture and lavish ornaments of
the room in which she sat made no portion of her
enjoyment. She would have been as happy in
the humblest abode with her children gathered
around a pine table, in health, as she was now.
Her happiness, as Echardt would have said,
she drew from within, and was not dependent
for it on outward circumstances. It often
takes a whole life to learn this `wisdom of
life,' and few attain it, else there would be
fewer to complain of this world, as
`A dull and fleeting show;'
a pendulum `swinging between a smile and a
tear.'
On opening the door, the husband and
father
was greeted by half a dozen voices.
`There is pa!' said the mother rising and
meeting him with a smile. `We were all
just wishing, dear, you would be in by eight
o'clock!
`Oh, pa, how glad I am your come!' cried a
rosy little fellow of eight years, throwing up
his arms with glee, `we want you to come
and play Dr. Busby with us.'
`Dear papa!' exclaimed Grace, the little
maiden of six years, whose pelisse her ma was
trimming with warm fur for the cold winter;
and leaving her chair she ran to him to be
kissed.
He stooped and took her in his arms, and
lifting her high from the floor, kissed her rosy
mouth and then let her down again; her
ringlets
flying in the rapid descent above her
head like a thousand ringlets of gold. With
a light bound she recovered herself and flew
back to her play, shouting, `Dr. Busby's son,'
when all laughed merrily and loud, for Dr.
Busby's son was not the right card to be called.
The scene fell like moral sunshine upon the
merchant's clouded heart; for he had come
home with a dark, gloomy spirit, having been
all day perplexed with new difficulties that
had arisen in his affairs. His reception and
the joyous hearts and the demonstrations of
affection restored him to himself and caused
him to forget his anxieties.
`You are cold, dear father,' said Ellen, his
eldest daughter, folding his hand in both her's!
`There is your nice arm-chair been waiting
for you all the evening. But I forgot to
introduce
you to Edward Elmore. He has just
returned from college!' and Ellen blushed;
why, she did not know!
The young collegian shook Mr. Hart's
hand in a frank, yet respectful manner,
saying
`I suppose you must quite have forgotten
me, sir?'
`Are you not Dr. Elmore's son?
`Yes, sir.'
`I know you more, sir, by the likeness you
bear your father than from any recollection I
have of you as a boy before you went away.'
`Edward has altered very much,' said Mrs.
Hart, looking at his manly figure and fine
open countenance with kindly admiration.
`And sister Ellen says he has grown so
handsome too!' hallooed from the circle round
the table little Tommy, the rosy cheeked,
curly-headed lad of eight years old. `I 'spec'
she'll have him for a beau!'
`Why Tommy are you not ashamed?'
exclaimed
Ellen, running to him and pulling his
hair, as much to hide her blushes from
Edward
as to punish him for his mischievous
betrayal
of her opinion.
`Ellen, dear, you will order your pa's tea
in,' said her mother with a smile.
The confused maiden ran out of the room
glad to hide her embarrassment. Would she
have been embarrassed, my fair reader, if
telltale
little Tommy instead of minding his
game of `Dr. Busby' had not come near the
truth? Would she have blushed if she had
thought
nothing about him? And would he
have colored as he did and turned to the
piano
to admire very perseveringly the gilded
ornaments encompassing the name of the
maker, if he had not thought of the beauteous
Ellen with more particularity than he regarded
other young misses?
We leave the question unanswered. The
random words of the little Tommy, however,
made an impression upon the minds of both
parents and instinctively they looked at each
other and divined each other's thoughts.
Young Edward Elmore, though still very
young, and just graduated at Yale College,
was destined nevertheless to hold a position
in society through the wealth and influence of
his family, that rendered him even at this age
a `good match' in prospective in the eyes of
parents who were far-sighted; and such a
parent was Mr. Hart. The idea took
possession
of his mind, and was one that he received
with pleasure.
Dr. Elmore, the father of Edward, had been
a physician in London, of considerable
eminence
;
but marrying a Bostonian, and
having
inherited a handsome fortune, he
removed
to the United States. He now resided in
Boston, a retired gentleman, but with the
reputation
of being rich; Edward was his oldest
son; but he had two daughters, both older
than Edward. The knowledge that Dr.
Elmore
was related to a noble family in England
gave him and his children a consideration in
society extraneous from that conferred upon
him by his wealth.
The character of Edward was every thing
a judicious and fond father could desire. He
was manly, honorable and frank. Integrity
and uprightness of heart and feeling strongly
characterized him. His disposition was
generous
,
and his intellect of a superior cast.
His advantages had been closely improved,
and he now was entering life with the
brightest
prospect before him of usefulness and
honor
.
He had already commenced the study of
medicine with his father; for, though rich, he
wisely resolved to secure to himself a means
of independence that had a basis more stable
than money. In his boyhood he had known
Ellen Hart, and one of his first visits, on his
return, had been to her, whose lovely image
had often flitted over his pages among Greek
characters, and the cold outlines of
mathematical
demonstrations.
CHAPTER II.
The morning after the family scene
described
in the last Chapter, Henry Hart was in
his private Counting Room. The door was
closed and the key turned in the lock. He
was walking the floor with a quick, restless
step. His usually placid brow wore a cloud,
and his lips were compressed with energy or
nibbled by his teeth with vexation. At
intervals
he would pause before the window and
look out, but with a vacant gaze, as no object
but a lofty brick wall was visible; or he would
cast his eyes upon his green cloth covered
table
,
where lay a confused pile of papers
folded
and torn open, and several letters looking
as if they had just been received, and with a
muttered word or two expressive of mental
suffering to which the sight give rise, clench
his hands forcibly and turn away, and
continue
his walk with greater vehemence than
before
.
At length he stopped full before the
table
,
took the arm chair and drawing it
towards
him sat down. His face was pale; his
eyes cold and hard, and upon his high, bald
forehead stood a large drop of sweat which
some internal anguish had forced through the
pores of the skin. He laid his forehead in his
hand and a deep sigh escaped him. At his
elbow lay an open letter on which his gaze
rested with that hopeless look of despair with
which the victim of the guillotine may be
supposed to contemplate the axe.
`There is no alternativeno other resource,'
he said in a hollow voice, unconsciously
speaking
audibly; `I must before three o'clock
this afternoon obtain the money or I am
ruined
my
credit is gone and my family
beggared
!
Never did a merchant open so fatal a
morning's mail as this that lies upon my
table
.
Losses and ill-adventure have come
upon
me from every wind of heaven! And the
intelligence in this letter from Vera Cruz has
put the climax upon my misfortunes. The
ship in which I had invested half of my means,
taken by a party of Mexican Revolutionists
in the very port, rifled of her cargo and
lawlessly
converted into a war-vessel; and the
policy of Insurance has expired some days,
and is unrenewed. To this comes two notes
due to-day, one of four and the other of seven
thousand dollars, which must be paid. To
this comes the failure of my speculation in
Indian lands and the utter worthlessness of
the bonds I hold. Of full seventy-two
thousand
dollars invested in various ways, I find
I possess not a single dollar. Yet here is my
mercantile firm, who must be maintained. I
have in it, and in property unmortgaged in
the city, say thirty thousand dollars. But my
liabilities are every dollar of my lost
investments
,
if not more. I cannot owe in notes
less than seventy-five thousand dollars. I am
therefore forty thousand dollars worse than
nothing. I am bankrupt if the world did but
know it. But the world does
not
know and
shall not know
,' he said emphatically. `No
one knows that I am not insured in my
Mexican
affair but myself and Creech. That man
must be taken into my confidence. I must
not sink without a struggle. These evils
have come upon me, I have not brought them
upon myself. I will see Creech, and consult
with him!'
He rose, and going to the door unlocked it,
and called in an even tone of voice,
`Mr. Creech!'
He then returned and resumed his place at
the table. The call was responded by a
slender
,
thin faced man, about forty years of age.
His head was very narrow and very high
above the ears, and the whity yellow hair that
adorned it was cut very short and precise
Mr. Creech's eye-brows were yellow and very
bushy and he prided himself upon three or four
of the hairs composing each for their length,
being in length full an inch and a half. These
formidable eye-brows shaded a pair of small
lively, weasel-looking eyes, in which always
shone a little sparkling light expressive of
vivacity
and cunning. The color of Mr.
Creech's visual organs was a hue between a
light blue and dark grey; a color often found
in some men, but difficult to describe. Men
who have eyes like those of Mr. Creech are
shrewd and dangerons to be trusted. Mr.
Creech's nose was short, quite too short for
his face, which was very long, unreasonably
long. His mouth had no outward sign of
lips. It was a narrow slit in the vast space
between his snip nose and the end of his long,
pointed chin. It opened and shut like an
oyster with as fine an edge. The first Clerk,
for such was the position held by Mr. Creech
in the Commercial House of Mr. Hart was
also a cultivator of whiskers, some of which,
or which we will cut of courtesy, and for want
of another word, call such, graced the sides of
his white face. They were about the size of
his eye-brows, and of the same tarnished
yellow
hue. The first clerk had also very large
ears, with which, nature, anticipating his
profession
,
had kindly furnished him doubtless
for the use he made of themviz, a sort of
`becket' for pens; four or five of which he
always had sticking above each generous
member. We will finish the portrait of Mr.
Creech by adding a neck, short and thick, in
a white and pink cravat, a white and pink
plaid waistcoat, a brown tonnish coat with
velvet collar, and velvet cuffs, with the
corner
of a white pocket handkerchief sticking
out of the pocket; a Gen. Jackson's head in
a breast-pin; a pair of black pants, and boots
with heels of unusual height, and an
enormous
seal ring graved with the `Creech Arms'
on his little finger. Mr. Creech never
cleaned
his teeth nor kept his nails free from
certain
black lines that sometimes adorn the
extremities
of those useful appendages.
`Mr. Creech,' said Henry Hart without
raising his eyes.
`Mr. Hart,' answered the first Clerk, with
a first Clerk's smile.
`You may turn the key in the door if you
please.'
Mr. Creech very obligingly complied with
the request, performing the act with as little
noise as he could make, and then he returned
on tip-too towards the table.
`Sit down if you please,' said Mr. Hart.
The first clerk bowed and sat down, fixing
his little ferret eyes upon Mr. Hart as if to
pick out beforehand a little of the matter about
to be touched upon.
`Mr. Creech I have called for you to
confide
in you,' said Mr. Hart, speaking after
several
counter resolutions in his mind not to
entrust
his secret to any one. But his
knowledge
of Creech's foresight, tact, and cunning
in business, strengthened his first purpose.
He also knew, or rather suspected, Mr.
Creech not to be very precise in his no
tions of morals; `in a business way,' always
`I shall feel myself honored by your
confidence
,
Muster Hurt,' answered the first Clerk
who had a habit of giving to
a
the sound of
u
.
`I huv often hud yur cunfidence, sir, und I
flutter myself I huv never betray'd it.'
`I have always been satisfied, Mr. Creech,
said Henry Hart blandly. `But the matter I
am now about to confide in you is not an
ordinary
business operation.'
Seeing that his employer was silent, and
seemed to be waiting for him to say something,
the first Clerk bowed and said,
`In whutever uffuir it may please you to
entrust to me, whether dumestic ur
mercuntile
,
I hup you will find me equully wurthy
of your cunfidence.
`The matter is one of the deepest
importance
to the interest of the House, Mr. Creech.
It concerns its commercial stability.'
The first Clerk started and looked at his
employer as if uncertain whether he had
rightly understood him.
`Uffecting the credit of the House!
Impussible
,
Mr. Hurt.'
`Creech,' said Mr. Hart, `I think I
understand
your disposition and feelings with
reference
to me. You have been long in my
employ
,
and your interests have, in a manner
been identified with my own.'
`Yes, sir, I huv always lukt ufter your
interests
,
Mr. Hurt,' answered the first Clerk
with a satisfied manner.
`I think I can assure myself of your
co-operation
now.'
`Certainly, sir.'
`Read that letter, Mr. Creech,' said the
merehant, placing in his hands the letter
informing
him of the loss of his vessel and cargo.
He eyed him closely as he read it to see the
effect produced upon him.
`This is truly unfortunateus the voyage
wud huv been immensely prufitable, if it had
been successful, Mr. Hurt. But the insurance
will cover.'
`The Policy is run out.'
`And not renewed by you, sir!'
`No. I meant to have done it to-day.'
`It is not now too late! The uffices dunt
know uf the luss,' said Mr. Creech eagerly.
while his little sparkling eyes, betrayed the
artfulness of his character.
He spake quick and without reflection, for
unprincipled men sometimes do. He was
brought to reflection by the expression of Mr.
Hart's face.
`Would you have me do an act like that
you suggest, sir?' demanded Mr. Hart sternly.
`Pardon me, sir; I was unly regarding your
interests, Mr. Hurt,'
`I see I can trust you, Mr. Creech,' said
the merchant changing his tone. `Listen to
me! I am ruined. This letter is but one of
several that came to me this morning, all
containing
bad news. I have not enough
property
at this moment to pay all my obligations,
by the sum of forty thousand dollars! You
look astonished. You are aware that my name
is on paper to a very heavy amount.'
`And eleven thousand dollars comes due
to-day.'
`I am aware of it,' answered the merchant,
gloomily pointing to the bank notices that lay
before him. `The ship and cargo is a dead
loss at present. I may obtain something by
way of indemnification from the Mexican
Government
by appealing to my own. But the
process would require time. The emergency
is pressing. The proposition you have made,
I frankly confess occurred to me. I am
confident
the offices have not the news. But
they will get it, suspect perhaps, and then I
may be detected in taking out a Policy after
the loss.
`But whut cun be done, sir?' asked the
first Clerk with a very heavy countenance;
for he was thinking of his six month's salary
yet due him and of being out of place.
`Your interests are allied with mineit is
for your benefit to remain with me. My ruin
will affect you.'
`I will do ull I cun, Mr. Hurt, to udvise
you.'
`My plan is this, viz; To carry on business
as if nothing had occurred and all was
prosperous
,
as it seems to be. To do this, I must
take up these notes due to-day. It is true I
have now no means as a basis, but I have the
credit of my mercantile name, and on this I
will obtain the money. I will continue to do
so until I can see what is likely to be the
result
.
You must go out and get this money
for me.'
`But they will soon hear of the luss of your
vessel, Mr. Hurt,' said Creech
sagaciously
.
`True; but no one is aware she was not
insured
.
The tna office does not know at this
moment but that I have got a Policy out at
some other.'
`True,' answered Mr. Creech, smiling at
his employer's deep shrewdness. `We cun
burrow un your name, Mr. Hurt, us much
money us we shull wont fur the liubilities of
the next sixty days.'
`Yes. This method is my only present
resource
.
I rely on your aid, Creech. What
the result will be ultimately I cannot foresee.
It will at least give me time to reflect on
future
proceedings. My name must be
sustained
.
Let these two notes due now be
protested
,
and to-morrow I could not borrow five
dollars to save my family from the Alms
House.'
`It would be the blow to your ruin, sir.'
`I well know it. They must first be looked
after and paid, and then I can have time to
deleberate before another note day comes
round.'
`Forbes & Co's draft accepted by you for
eight thousand dollars, based on the two
hundred
and ten bales of cotton you bought of
them is the next.'
`When does it become due?'
`On the 16th19th.'
`And this is the ninth.'
`Yes, sir.'
`I cannot be ruined, Creech.'
`It will never do, sir.'
`I wish you to take my note for twelve
thousand dollars, which I will fill out and sign
in a moment to Grace, Frealy & Co., and get
their endorsement; also that of B. Pearce &
Co. I will make the note at sixty days. I
would go myself, but I fear that they might
discover from my countenance, which I
cannot
very well command, that all is not right.
You will do better.'
While Mr. Hart was speaking a singular
expression came over the warped features of
the first Clerk. It was a compound of
cunning
,
power, ambition, and self-gratification.
He looked thoughtful, and assumed a very
humble air.
`You are silent, Mr. Creech.'
`I wus thinking, sir.'
`Well, I hope you will think what is for
your own and my advantage. If I fall you
fall with me.'
`I know it, sir.'
`Something seems to be on your mind
`You just said I must think to my own
advantuge
,'
ventured the first Clerk.
`Well.'
`I was duing so,' answered Creech a little
more confidentially.
`Out with it,' cried Mr. Hart impatiently,
who saw he had some covert purpose.
`You say you are ruined, sir,' said Creech
boldly, `and these letters prove it. You wish
to sustain your credit awhile lunger un a faith
placed in you by uthers. You desire my
ussistunce
and huv mude me your cunfidunt.
You are pleased to say you depend un my
couperution
for success.'
`And do you intend to betray this confidence
and trust?' demanded Mr. Hart.
`No, sir.'
`Then why this enumeration?'
`To impress upon your mind your true
position
and that which you occupy.'
`You are impertinent, sir.'
`Pardun me, Mr. Hurt I meant-no uffence.
Perhaps I am not so clear as I wish to be. In
a word if you wish to engage me as a party in
a fraudulent trunsuction, you will best secure
your interests and my full co-uperation by
making me a partner.'
`A partner in my Housemy mercantile
House do you mean?' repeated the merchant
with surprise and indignation.
`Such wus my meaning, Mr. Hurt,'
answered
Creech cooly.
The merchant remained thoughtful a few
moments, rose from his chair and once or
twice walked the room.
`It is well. I will do it. I have no House
unless I can sustain myself. The papers shall
at once be drawn up. But on one
condition
.'
`Name it.'
`That you negotiate all money matters.'
`I consent.'
`We understand each other, then, Creech,'
`Yes, sir,' answered the new partner with
imperturable coolness. `We are to be
partners
in a business based on a fraud, and to
sustain each other in sustaining
our
House.'
`Yes,' answered the merchant with a
feeling
of contempt and shame, not unmingled
with an undefined apprehension of future evil.
But he who prefers crime to poverty must
reap the fruit of the harvest he sows.
The notes in bank were paid by means of
he endorsement of the two firms above named.
The next morning appeared in the papers the
following advertisement:
`Henry Hart having this day taken into
copartnership
of business, Crockett Creech, the
Firm will henceforth bear the designation of
`Hart and Creech.'
HENRY HART.
CROCKET CREECH.
CAAPTER
III.
Henry Hart
was only relieved from one
source of anxiety to be plunged into another.
In forming the co-partnership with his
unprincipled
Clerk, Crocket Creech, he had
sought a temporary purpose. This purpose
he had effected. His notes were all met, and
his credit remained unsuspected. The secret
of the means by which it had been sustained
was known only to himself and his partner.
But it was necessary not only to have money
to lift their notes as they came due, but also
for pursuing their business, and for their
mutual
maintainance. The expense of Mr.
Hart's family, in his style of living was five
thousand dollars per annum; and Mr. Creech,
though a bachelor, as an equal partner,
considered
himself entitled to an equal sum.
One morning the two met in their counting
room. It was just a month after their
criminal
copartnercy was formed; in consenting to
which, Mr. Hart felt that he had sold himself
to his unprincipled partner. Creech was
writing at the desk when Mr. Hart came in,
and silently sat down by the table to glance
over the morning papers. Creech paused in
in his writing, and after surveying the face of
his senior partner in the firm with penetrating
eyes, he laid aside the pen and approached the
table. Mr. Hart raised his eyes. They were
heavy and thoughtful. His brow looked care
worn. The frank and dignified bearing, the
open demeanor of the honest and upright
merchant
were gone. He felt himself criminal,
and looked one.
`Well, Mr. Creech,' he said gloomily; `any
thing unpleasant to communicate?'
`No, sir, I have a little business on my
mind, we had best talk over.'
`Well,' answered Mr. Hart in a sort of
despairing
tone of voice.
`The old notes are all paid in the Bank by
the new endorsements,' said Mr. Creech
cheerfully, and with a very well satisfied air.
`Our firm, under its present name, takes well.
Found no difficulty in getting the names I
asked. Everybody glad to oblige!' And Mr.
Creech looked precisely as if this universal
disposition to oblige was all owing to the
connection
of his name with the house.
`It was surely a great relief to get those
notes and drafts paid,' said Henry Hart,
looking
as if the means to which he had resorted
in conjunction with Creech, to meet them,
had left a heavier load on his mind than was
there before.
`It was. None of the new notes come due
under thirty-five days. Plenty of breathing
time, you see, Mr. Hart.'
The merchant sighed.
`You have too tender a conscience about
these matters, Mr. Hart,' said Creech, who
seemed to take to villainy with the greatest
facility in the world. `All we have done has
been in a business way. All fair and above
board till found out!'
`That is what troubles me! It will be very
difficult to conceal our operations long,'
answered
Mr. Hart, looking into his partner's
face, as if for that strength and confidence he
felt himself so deficient in. It is true he had
consented to a course of criminal duplicity to
sustain his credit, but now that his credit had
been sustained he felt that the sense of wrong
was heavier upon him than the satisfaction
which he expected would have followed. He
would have rather now endure all the fears of
mercantile ruin he before experienced than
bear the pains of conscience and sense of
self-degradation
which now pressed him to the
earth. He felt degraded, too, at his
association
with another, who now acted out his true
character without fear; a character perfect in
cunning and duplicity; and wholly superior
to the twinges of conscience, or the reflections
of remorse. To be linked, inseparably, with
such a person whom he felt would stop at
nothing, now that power was placed in his
hands, caused him each day increasing alarm
and unavailing regrets. He felt his
character
was wholly in his partner's hands; and
that if he chose he would make him the
instrument
of any depraved villainy his fertile
brain might conceive.
Creech, on the other hand, felt all the
advantages
of his connection with Mr. Hart.
His acute, plotting mind foresaw all the
benefits
that might accrue to himself from the
partnership
,
though on forming it l.e was well
aware Mr. Hart was not only not worth a
dollar
in the world, but several thousands worse
than nothing. But Creech was honest only
where it was his interest to be so. He was
ready to be dishonest if he could thereby make
it more for his advantage than to remain
honest
.
The situation of Mr. Hart's affairs, with
the guilty proposition this gentleman made to
him to enable the house to sustain its falling
credit, presented to his mind a fair opening
for an advantageous investment of his genius.
He saw at a glance all the privileges and all
the risks. His eye coolly surveyed the
dangers
that encompassed the path before him,
and his sagacity devised a way of escaping
their responsibility.
It has been seen with what art he effected
his purpose in becoming a partner in the
House. From this time seeming to act with
Mr. Hart, he acted only for himself. He made
Mr. Hart his instrument, even before that
gentleman had a fear awakened that he might
do so.
The endorsements to the notes to take up
the matured paper, were obtained personally
by Mr. Creech, from merchants with whom
he had mutually endorsed, but he in every
instance
bore from Mr. Hart a line, which he
persuaded him to write, addressed to the
Houses whose endorsements were to be
solicited
to this effect:
`Gentlemen,
Your endorsement upon the enclosed note
for  at  days will oblige,
Very truly yours,
HENRY HART.
Now of Firm of HART & CREECH.
Thus Mr. Creech felt that if discovery took
place the responsibility could be easily
removed
from his own shoulders to those of the senior
partner. Yet he felt he was not altogether
secure, and could not be too cautious.
`There can be no fear of detection, if we are
true to our own interests,' he said in reply to
the remarks of Mr. Hart.
Mr. Creech spoke significantly. The
merchant
looked at him with a troubled
countenance
.
`You do not understand me, Mr. Hart,' said
the junior partner, taking a pen from behind
his ear, opening his penknife and cooly nibbing
it upon his thumb nail.
`No. If it is any more endorsing on
nothing
I have done with it.'
`Pooh, pooh, sir, we have just began.'
`Just begun! Mr. Creech, I entered into
this matter with you, only for a specific end.'
`And is that end attained.'
`Yes. The notes are met, and the ruin that
menaced me postponed till I could have time
for reflection. I have reflected; and the
conclusion
I have come to is, that the fruit is not
worth the risk I have run.'
`You surprise me! You then would prefer
being a bankrupt, to your present fair credit.'
`I am a bankrupt.'
`Only to yourself and me! The world is
ignorant of it.'
`I would rather have been honestly ruined
a month ago, by the loss of my vessels and
the other misfortunes that I brought not upon
myself, than be at this moment as I am,
feeling
as I do. Then I should only have lost
my mercantile name, which would alone have
touched me. But now, detection of the
course I have resorted to will not only blast
my reputation as a merchant, but ruin my
character, and inflict upon my wife and
children
indelible infamy.'
`What do you propose to do, sir?' asked
Mr. Creech, surprised at the emotion and
positive spirit shown by Mr. Hart, who after
speaking, rose up and paced the
counting-room
with a highly agitated manner.
`Do?' he repeated sternly. `Stop where
we are.'
`And how will you meet the note with
Green & Kennedy's endorsement due in thirty
five days; and the other notes that all come
due within sixty days?'
`Not by getting other endorsements on false
paper,' answered Mr. Hart firmly.
`How then, sir?' asked the junior partner
quietly.
Mr. Hart was silent. He stopped in his
agitated walk and looked thoughtful.
`They must not be protested,' he said very
positively, his sensitiveness as a merchant
for the moment rising above every other
feeling
.
`It would bring inquiry and detection.'
`It may as well come first as last. I
expect
every moment when the news of my
losses
at sea will get into the papers; when, of
course, I shall be asked where I insured. If
I tell the truth my credit is impaired at once.
It is my intention, as soon as it is made
public
,
to use the news as a pretext for failing,
and it will be an excuse for not taking up the
notes due. Under color of it (as no one but
ourselves know of our having had letters,) I
can make an honest failure. I am tired of
this suspensethis state of alarmthis
continued
fear of detection.
`This is a very weak and idle course, Mr.
Hurt. Besides, it is one I shall by no means
consent to. It is not my intention, a month
after entering into partnership to fail when I
can sustain myself.'
`You have no certainty that you can.'
`I have. We only need to act togetherto
be bold and confident, and success and fortune
are ours.'
Mr. Hart stared with surprise at the
resolute
words and manner of his partner. After
a moment he slowly shook his head.
`Impossible. I dare not risk it. I have a
wifechildren who look up to me'
`True,' interrupted Creech, not giving him
time to complete his sentence; `it is for this
very reason you should now go on as we have
begun. You say you are willing to fail.
Will not this beggar those who look up to you
for support? Every thing will be taken, even
to your household furniture. You will be
turned into the street. You will have to rent
some wretched hovel. You will be
accountable
for all the evils your family may suffer in
their poverty and destruction.'
`You paint a dreadful picture,' said Mr.
Hart, shuddering. `I feel all its truth, But
what I meant was, that in your disgrace, if
detection follows, no one is involved but
yourself
.
In mine, my family are mingled.'
`So much the more need to be firm now,
that you may bring upon them neither
poverty
on one hand, nor disgrace on the other. I
I think I understand your feelings, Mr. Hart.
But your true position is this; on one hand
you are ready to surrender yourself as a
bankrupt
,
and become a beggar with your family!
On the other hand you have before you
certain
support for them in their present position
in society, with only a risk that your mode of
doing business may
possibly
be discovered,
and bring upon you and them disgrace. On
one side is positive beggary; on the other
scarcely possible detection and dishonor. In
a word, Mr. Hart, you have gone too far to
recede.'
`I fear I have,' he said bitterly. But if I
consent longer to pursue this criminal course,
what certainty is there that it will profit us
beyond putting off the evil day, Mr. Creech?
You know well we have no money. How are
we to realize ten thousand a year to be shared
between us, and pay the salaries of our clerks?
God knows how we are to realize the first
hundred! We have in store about eight
thousand dollars worth of merchandize on
commission, which is already bargained for.
Our commissions will be a mere nothing. We
have false notes due altogether in six weeks,
to the amount of thirty-four thousand dollars,
of which we cannot pay a dollar. I owe for
the rent of the store eight hundred dollars,
and clerk's salaries now due, amount to
twenty-one
hundred more. I owe heavy grocer's
accounts, and apothecary bills, and a hundred
other family debts. If you can tell me a
better
course than to fail at once, let me hear it.'
`Fail you shall not, with my consent, sir,'
answered the junior partner in a resolute and,
as Mr. Hart thought, a menacing tone. `I
have too much at stake lightly to suffer such
a step to be taken.'
`Do you dictate, sir?
`No, sir. Let us understand one another
perfectly, Mr. Hart. In making me the
confidant
of your affairs, you laid open to me the
duplicity of your character, because you
needed
me. In becoming your confidaut I
exposed
to you my own principles, which you see
are rather liberal. In a word, we
communicated
(for purposes founded on mutual
interest
)
each to the other our true characters.
We therefore mutually had a hold upon each
other. As partners in deception we are on
equal footiug. We are neither authorised to
dictate, and neither compelled, either, to
succumb
.
In this matter I am your equal. Now
tant I have let you see my character, I am not
going to part with the secret for nothing. I
must realise something by it.'
`In supposing me your equal in villainy,
sir,' said Mr. Hart with severe dignity, `you
labor under a great error. Your character, I
see is rotten thoroughly. My duplicity, of
which you speak, was caused by a sudden
reverse
,
and was only adopted to effect a
temporary
object. I am now willing to atone for
my error by embracing the condition, which,
by a criminal course, I have attempted to flee.'
`We are embarked together. Take one
step towards this purpose, and I betray you
from the beginning, Mr. Hart. You are in
error if you think you can now go back with
honesty. All your late notes can be proved
to have been drawn since you were informed
of your losses. There are, besides, proofs
that'
`Enough. I am in your toils, villain. Now
let me hear your plans!'
`You can call me names, Mr. Hart. I could
retort and apply them to you with equal force.
The consciousness of this is all the
satisfaction
I ask. The course of conduct I propose
adopting you ask me to explain to you. I will
do so.'
As the junior partner spoke he advanced to
the desk where he had been writing when Mr.
Hart came in; and taking a key from his
pocket opened with it a small drawer and took
out several slips of paper. He then returned,
and taking a chair familiarly near the
merchant
,
laid them on the table.
CHAPTER IV.
After
the Junior Partner had placed the
papers which he had taken from the drawer,
before Mr. Hart, he fixed a steady look upon
his face for an instant and then said, in an
under tone,
`By reading these you will see the outline
of my plan of operations, Mr. Hart.'
`What is this?' exclaimed the merchant
taking up one of the slips and intently
regarding
it. `A note for ten thousand dollars
signed by Dr. Elmore and made payable to
me! I have not had any transactions with
Dr. Elmore, at least money transactions for
several years.'
`Very probable,' answered Creech dryly;
`nevertheless here is his note for ten thousand
dollars.'
`How did you come by it?' demanded Mr.
Hart with surprise, after carefully
examining
it, and satisfying himself that it was all in
form.
`I will explain that in a moment. Be so
kind as to glance at the three other pieces of
paper, sir.'
`Another note drawn by Dr. Elmore in
favor
of our Firm for ten thousand dollars! One
for eight thousand drawn by Robert Stebbins,
and one for five thousand by Mr. Appleton,
late of the House of Appleton & Co? What
means all this, Mr. Creech?' cried Mr. Hart,
a momentary suspicion arising to his mind.
`That these notes only require our
endorsement
and that of another House to be
discounted
.
You see one is for 60 daysone for
90, and the other two at four months.
Ample
time for all our purposes.'
`Mr. Creech,' exclaimed the merchant
rising to his feet and speaking with indignant
emotion, `those four notes are forged. The
names are forgeries, sir! How dare you lay
such paper before me, and have the audacity
to demand my endorsement of the Firm.'
`They are forgeries, Mr. Hart,' replied the
Junior Partner calmly.
`And you contess it. Sir, with these
evidences
of your guilt in my possession,' he
cried, grasping the notes firmly and closely
within his hand, `I no longer fear you. You
are in
my
power, not I in yours! This
moment
consent to my wishes that all be at once
stopped where it is, or I will with these in my
hands, have you arrested.'
The Junior Partner remained perfectly
composed
in look and manner, during the
utterance
of his threat. Mr. Hart was surprised,
and seeing a smile at the corner of his mouth,
a misgiving came over him.
`You do not speak, sir.'
`I have nothing to say, Mr. Hart. If you
object to this step I am very sorry to have
displeased
you by suggesting it. But as you
had once before made use of Mr. Stebbin's
name, in a similar manner, I was not
prepared
for so decided a refusal.'
The merchant turned pale. He hung his
head in silent shame, not unmixed with alarm.
An act committed three years before, and
which he supposed unknown to every human
being, was not a secret to his Junior Partner.
He felt that he was indeed in his power. But
his vexation and alarm were not greater than
his astonishment at Creech's knowledge of
the fact to which he had alluded. He saw
now that there was no further use in
struggling
against the current, to which in an evil
hour he had committed himself, and that he
had opened before him for the future, a way
of guilt and crime he shuddered to
contemplate
.
He sat a few moments wholly
overcome
,
and with a countenance wearing the
pallor of the sepulchre. Large drops of sweat
stood upon his forehead and his nether lip was
tremulous with emotion. Creech stood
observing
him with a look of malicious triumph.
At length the merchant spoke but without
looking up,
`I see, Mr. Creech, we have nothing to
reproach
one another with. I was not aware
you knew this first wrong act of my
mercantile
life. May I ask you how a circumstance
became known to you, which I believed was
a secret locked in my own breast?'
`I learned it from Mr. Stebbens himself.'
`From
himself
! Impossible! Could he have
known my use of his name, and suffered it to
pass.'
`No. I was well aware of your
embarrassment
at the time, being your first Clerk;
indeed
you made no secret of it to me, and
wondered
where you could possibly obtain the
$12,000 you required, without impairing your
credit. The next day you handed me Mr.
Stebbins' note to take to the Bank for discount.
It was discounted and you received the money,
but I had at the time no suspicion that it was
a forgery.'
`And how did you discover it?' asked Mr.
Hart, throwing off some of his habitual
reserve
.
`In this way. A few days before it became
due I was in the bank. Mr. Stebbins himself
stood talking with another gentleman near
the Cashier. He was speaking of endorsing
in a manner that led me to suppose he had just
declined letting the gentleman have his name.
`I have not,' he said, `put my name to paper
in any shape for the last three months, and
shall not give it again to go into the bank. It
is on some paper of old date and I shall not
renew it at maturity. I have recently refused
Henry Hart and others.' `Your note bearing
Mr. Stebbins' signature I recollected had
been dated within forty days, and his remark
that he had refused you led me to suspect that
you had forged his name!'
Mr. Hart started and colored at the blunt
mode in which Mr. Creech spoke the words.
But he remained silent.
`This suspicion led me to examine the note
while in the hands of the bank, and I was
strengthened in my suspicion. But a singular
circumstance removed it beyond all doubt.'
`And what was this?' eagerly questioned
Mr. Hart, in a tone of the deepest surprise.
`The next day I was looking over your
blotting book for a slip of paper to write a
porter's order upon, when on one of the leaves
of the blotting paper I saw writing very boldly
impressed. It was inverted and reversed, and
I took out my pocket mirror to reflect it so
that I could read it; a thing that is often done
successfully. There has been many a secret
betrayed by blotting paper. To my surprise
I saw it was the form of Mr. Stebbins' note,
and his signature beneath it, all as clearly
legible as the original writing. It showed me
at once that the note and signature were
written
at the same time and dried together. I
knew Mr. Sebbins had not been in the
Countring-room
;
besides you had told me when you
brought me the note that he had signed it at
his house! Here is the blotting paper,' added
Creech, going and taking it from his private
drawer and exhibiting it to him, though
careful
not to let him have in his possession so
powerful an instrument over his fears.
`I find I have nothing to conceal from you,
Mr. Creech. But, if you have so long
possessed
this secret why did you not before avail
yourself of it for your own interests!'
`I was waiting my time.'
`And you have entrusted it to no one!'
`No, sir. Are you now ready, Mr. Hart, to
act with me and fully sustain me in my plans.'
`It is a risk; but I am in your power.'
`We must go on for our mutual safety.
Besides we must have ready money. These
notes before you on their receiving your
endorsement
will at once be negotiated.'
`Your endorsement for the Firm will
answer
equally well, Mr. Creech,' he said putting
aside the pen filled with ink, proffered to him
by his Junior Partner.
`Your hand-writing would inspire more
confidence in the bank than mine, Mr. Hart.'
`Very well. Are you sure we are alone?'
he said looking round with suspicion and
alarm.
`Quite so,' answered Creech, going to the
door and trying the lock, and then returning
to the table.
`How shall we provide for these notes, Mr.
Creech?' asked the fallen merchant, `before
they are due. The bank must not have time
to send notices to these persons whose names
we borrow.
`They will be provided for by other notes
drawn up in the same manner. In this way
we can carry on the business of the Firm and
sustain the credit of the House. You can
support your family in the style in which they
now live; and I shall be able to live in a
better
style than I have done as a clerkperhaps
take a wife,' added the Junior Partner
facetiously
.
`This is a dangerous business, but I see no
remedy,' answered Mr. Hart, taking the pen
Creech still held out.
With a tremulous hand the merchant
endorsed
one after another the notes with the
name of the Firm to which three were made
payable, the fourth being drawn in favor of
himself individually. He hesitated a moment
before he wrote his name on this, and after
doing so flung down the pen and covered his
face with his hands. Mr. Creech took up the
notes.
For God's sake do not dry the names with
blotting paper!' suddenly cried Mr. Hart.
`I always use sand, sir. I never leave
inverted
copies of notes and letters for Clerk's
to read with looking glasses.'
The notes were duly presented to the bank
and discounted, for better names than they
bore were not desired by the Directors. The
credit of the Firm of Hart and Creech was
sustained by the money thus obtained; and
Mr. Hart continued to live in his usual style;
and Mr. Creech took board at the most
fashionable
hotel, and kept a horse and buggy and
was altogether very magnificent. He
enjoyed
himself, for he had no conscience. But
Mr. Hart carried about with him a heavy
spirit and a clouded brow. On `Change men
gave his great business the credit for it,
supposing
it required much and constant thought.
His wife discovered the change in him, but
to all her solicitous inquiries he returned
vague and brief replies. This silence deeply
afflicted her, and foreboding of evil
depressed
her. His children felt the change in his
manner and tone of voice and shunned rather
than flew to him. Thus those whom he had
sacrificed every thing to make happy were in
all their outward prosperity made wretched
by him. Happiness was never yet the fruit
of guilt. It bears sorrow ever, and forever
sorrow will follow it. There are moral laws
and necessities as well as physical; and the
results of each are irresistably produced from
causes equally apparent. On the other hand
good will as certainly produce happiness and
peace. Evil never came of a good act, was
never the fruit of uprightness and integrity.
He who seeks a good by an evil way is sure
to be disappointed; not only in not attaining
the good he pursues, but in obtaining an evil
he did not expect.
These reflections passed through the mind
of Mr. Hart as he looked around him and saw
the untoward fruits of his iniquity. But like
a man whom error has made both weak and
blind he went forward anticipating every
hour when he should plunge into the gulf that
he saw yawned to receive him.
At length the time came he had looked
forward
to in sleepless nights and wretched days.
The three notes had been taken up by Creech,
by means of notes with the same names,
negotiated
a day or two before at other banks.
There remained but one more due, and this
was one of those forged on Dr. Elmore for
$10,000. Mr. Creech with his usual
foresight
had made arrangements to provide for it,
by drawing another note and forging the name,
presenting it to Mr. Hart for his signature,
who without a word always endorsed
whatever
was offered to him by the Junior Partner.
This new note, however, met with quite an
unlooked for fate. Creech had offered it the
day before discount-day at the Bank so that
the funds could be drawn in time to meet the
other, which would be at maturity the next
week. But it so chanced that on the
morning
of the day of discounting it was
discovered
that the Bank had been broken open, the
books mutilated, a large amount of money
taken
,
and the papers of the Bank thrown, as if
by design, into the most inextricable
confusion
.
The Directors, therefore, transacted no
business, and the note lay over with others till
the next discount day. But this would be too
late to use the money and Creech withdrew
the note, and set his wits to work what to do.
He thought of going to a broker with the
paper
,
but he feared that Dr. Elmore might
possibly
hear of his name being used on the
street and that a discovery would then be
inevitable.
The day of taking up the matured note at
length arrived and nothing had been done.
Every resource had failed them. The Junior
Partner could not resort to another expedient.
Mr. Hart, who, inspired by the near danger,
had greatly exerted himself, was almost in
despair. A protest would surely lead to a
detection of the forgery.
`We must try a broker, sir,' said Creech,
as the hand of the counting-house clock
pointed
silently to one o'clock. `There is but
little
time.'
`We must run this risk,' answered the
merchant
with an accent and look of calm
desperation
.
Mr. Creech took up his hat and
left the counting-room.
In a half an hour Creech re-entered with a
smiling face.
`It is done. Here are nine thousand and
nine hundred dollars. You have a hundred
in the safe.'
`Who did it?'
`W .'
`Did he question you?'
`No. I told him of the cause, the robbery
of the bank. He was satisfied.'
`If it can be kept from Dr. Elmore.'
`I think there is no fear. Indeed I told
W  not to let it be known he had done it
to the Dr., as he might not like to have a note
given for discount in bank, negotiated by a
broker.'
`I will go to the bank with the money and
take up the note myself,' answerd Mr. Hart.
As he spoke he took possession of the bank
notes and left the counting-room.
CHAPTER V.
Mr
. Hart, traversed the streets in the
direction
of the bank with a light step and a
feeling of great relief. He held in his hand
the money to take up the last forged note then
out, and in his inmost soul he resolved it should
be the last he would put his name to,
whatever
exposure his Junior Partner might see fit
to make in revenge.
`I am tired of this constant, harrassing
nervous
apprehension of detection. Cleepless
nights and feverish days! Carrying a weight
about me in my bosom like lead! In ten
minutes I shall have this last evidence of my
forgeries in my possession, and then I am free.
Creech will threaten, but I am persuaded he
will do nothing. He knows his own ruin will
be involved in mine. Let poverty come to
me and mine. The experience I have had of
the last few weeks has been enough to
convince
me that it is far more desirable than
competence and luxury sustained by crime.
So much for the first step in error taken four
years ago to save my credit. It may be called
a `fiction' in commercial phrase; but it is one
in which is involved the most fearful realities.
`Merchants have done it before,' says the
wily Creech; `it is no new thing to use names
of rich men in bank. They never know it if
the notes are taken up.' But the risk is
immense
as I have bitterly seen, and the guilt is
precisely that of the forger. A merchant that
will make a fictitious note in the manner that
I have done is to all purpose a
forger!
Such
oh, God! is my crime! I hold in my hand the
means of saving myself, but the guilt, because
I can prevent its discovery, is no less. Ah,
the bank is in my sight! In two minutes I
shall have this weight off my mind. Dr.
Elmore's
forged name will once more be in my
hands.'
Mr. Hart was just then turning the corner
of Kilby street. The bank was but a few rods
distant on the opposite side of the way. In
his hurry and anxiety and with his thoughts
so busily engaged he did not observe that the
walks in some places were covered with ice
which required great caution in traversing
them. He hastened across State street and
stepped without heed upon the curbstone
directly
before the Bank door. It was as
slippery
as glass. His foot slipped, he
endeavored
to recover himself with the other when it
also flew out from under him and he fell
headlong
into the very door way of the bank,
striking
his temples heavily against the stone
step.
He was immediately taking up insensible,
and conveyed into the Apothecary's at the
corner of Washington street, where the usual
means were made use of to restore him. They
were, however, only partially successful. He
partly opened his eyes and his lips moved with
scarcely audible sounds. The words were
`notes'`pocket book'`Bank'`two
o'clock'
`pay.'
No one understood the meaning of the
incoherent
phrases, which were scarcely
intelligibly
uttered. He was placed in a carriage;
and, accompanied by Dr. Blake, his physician,
who happened to be going into the Post Office
as he was being taken into the apothecary's
opposite, to his residence in  street. The
motion of the carriage revived him a little. He
opened his eyes and looked wildly around him.
He recognised his physician and the reality
of his situation seemed to come full upon his
mind.
He raised himself from the position in which
he had laid reclining against the back of the
coach, felt in his breast for his pocket book
and vehemently grasped the Doctor's arm.
`For God's sake stop the carriage, Doctor,'
he cried with vehemence.
`Be calm, my dear sir,' said the physician
soothingly. `You have been hurt and will
soon be at home where you can receive
attention
.'
`Home!' he repeated almost with a shriek
which led the Doctor to believe that his brain
had been seriously injured and that he was
deranged, `I have no home, if you do not stop
the carriage this instantno home but a
prisoner's cell,' he muttered in a deep,
painful
tone, that confirmed his physician's opinion
of his insanity.
`Will you not stop the coach, sir? Then
I
will!' he cried furiously. He was on the
back seat of the carriage, and as he spoke
threw himself forward and dashed his
clenched
hand through the front glass.
`Driver, stop the carriage this instant!,
`Mr. Hart,' said the physician grasping his
bleeding hand which he had cut with the
glass, and speaking firmly `you must be
seated
and be composed. In a few moments we
shall be at your house.'
`Shall I stop the coach intirely for the
madman
,
Docthur?' asked the coachman, who
had reined in his horses and was now
thursting
his face back through the broken pane.
`Nodrive on as rapidly as you can go!'
`If he does I will have your life, Doctor?'
fiercely cried the merchant, attempting to
seize the physician by the throat with his
disengaged
hand.
`You must be calm, Mr. Hart?'
`Calm! Tell me to be calm when infamy
and ruin hang over my head! What is the
hour?' he cried at the same time taking out
his watch. `Perhaps my fate is already
sealed
!'
He glanced at it.
It was twenty minutes
past the hour when his note should have been
paid
. He crushed the watch up in his
phrezied
grasp till the sharp pieces of glass
penetrated
the palm of his hand; when he
violently
dashed it upon the floor of the coach
and ground it beneath his heel. He threw
himself back in the carriage and covered his
face with his hands. The calmness of his
manner singularly contrasted with his
violence
the instant before. The Doctor made
no remark but watched him closely as he
would a maniac. Suddenly he threw out his
hands. A ray of hope lighted up his features
of despair.
`It is not too late. I can pay it without any
disgrace coming upon me, or discovery. My
fall will be taken as an excuse. It is known I
fell near the bankdidn't I Doctor? And
here is the money in my pocket-book. They
wont protest it! I will go now! They will let
me pay it and it will pass as if nothing had
happened. Doctor stop this carriage,' he said
in a tone of command.
`We are near your house now, Mr. Hart!'
`Hear me, sir! I am not mad, but I shall
be if you thwart me! I was going into the
bank to pay a note due at 2 o'clock, when it
seems I slipped and fell. I recollect falling.
It is now past the hour, but it may not be too
late, to save protest when it is explained that
I was going into the bank to pay the note
when I slipped. I have got the money here
and I insist, sir, in going at once to the bank.
My creditmy honorall is at stake, sir!
Do not countermand my order to the driver.'
`Do not trouble yourself to speak to him,
Mr. Hart. You shall be gratified. I can now
in some degree account for your manner.'
The Doctor gave the order to the driver to
turn back and proceed towards  Bank
in State Street. The carriage had arrived in
sight of Mr. Hart's house when the carriage
turned.
We will precede them to the bank. After
Mr. Hart had been taken up by some of his
friends, the merchants near, and conveyed to
the Apothecary and from thence had been
sent homeward under the care of his
physician
,
his fall was a few moments afterwards
the subject of a conservation by a group of
gentleman gathered in front of the bank.
Among them was a man about fifty, of a
dignified
,
courtly presence, and the air of an
highly accomplished person. He was
dressed
with great neatness, in an olive brown coat
with broad skirts, and wore ruffles in his
bosom; his grey head was covered by a broad
brimmed white hat, and he carried in his hand
a gold-headed cane well polished by use. On
the head was engraved `Dr. Elmore.'
`I fear Mr. Hart will not get over this very
soon,' said the President of an Insurance
company
to the others.
`It was a heavy fall,' was the reply of an
East India merchant; who in the same breath
turned and asked his friend how such a stock
stood.
`Falling,' was the reply.
`If Hart should not get over this,' said a
retired Kilby street importer, `his new
partner
,
Creech would have jumped into a fine
business.'
`I suppose Mr. Hart would leave his
family
quite independent?' remarked the cashier
of a bank to Dr. Elmore.
`I presume so, sir, though I know but
little
about his affairs of late.'
`There are rumors that he has met with
some bad speculations,' said the first
merchant
who had spoken. `But he keeps his
business affairs so close few know much about
it.'
`He seems to stand well in Bank. I see
he easily gets discounted what paper he
offers
,'
said a brokerthe same Mr. W
who had negotiated the note that morning
with Dr. Elmore's name forged to it, with the
amount of which in his possession Mr. Hart
had come to take up the other forged note,
when he met with his accident.
`I believe sothough there was a rumor
yesterday his ship and cargo that was seized
by the Mexican's was no where insured.'
`Is it possible?' exclaimed the broker.
`Mr. Felton of the  Insurance office
told me yesterday that his board had taken it;
but that the policy expired and that Mr. Hart
had not renewed it with them. That he
asked
him a day or two ago when the loss of the
vessel was made known through the papers,
where he was insured and his reply was at
Hartford and New London. But one of the
directors from Hartford was here yesterday,
and on being spoken to incidentally upon the
subject told me that there was no such policy
given from the office there, and that Mr. Hart
must have been misunderstood.'
`Doubtless he was, sir,' said Dr. Elmore. `I
have long known Mr. Hart and believe him
to be in every respect an honorable man.'
This opinion was assented to by all present,
and the individuals of the group moved
different
ways, forgetting Mr. Hart and his
concerns
.
Dr. Elmore remained standing by the bank
door alone, surveying the busy scene on
'Change, when he was rejoined by Mr. W
the broker who had just been into the
bank to make a deposit. As he came out the
clock struck two.
`I was just in time, Dr. Elmore.'
`Yes, sir.'
`Doctor,' he said after a moment's
hesitation
and embarrassnent, `suppose you had
offered a note to the  Bank which was
broken open, for discount, and the discount
business was suspended and your note came
back upon your hands would you object to
negotiating it with a broker? and for him to
use it?'
`With my name, on it, sir?'
`Yes, sir.'
`Certainly, sir. I, however, should not be
likely to offer such a note. I do very little
banking business and only for the purpose of
carrying through old business. I do nothing
new.'
`But you occasionally give your note in
payment when you purchase.'
`No, sir. I always pay by checks.'
`You give your endorsement to your friends
sometimes, and suppose one of them should
come into my hands would you object to my
making use of it in market?'
`I should object decidedly, sir. But I
have given my endorsement to no new
paper
for a long time, sir.'
`You mean '
`I mean, Mr. W, what I say. I have
not signed or endorsed my name for six
months past on any paper.'
`Can it be possible?' exclaimed Mr. W
looking at him with surprise and perplexing
doubt.
`Why are you so astonished, sir?'
At this moment a gentleman came forth
from the bank with a pen in his hand and
without his hat, and touched Dr. Elmore on
the shoulder.
`Doctor, one moment if you please.'
`Stay a moment, Doctor,' entreated Mr.
W.
`But an instant, sir,' said the notary.
Mr. W  not knowing what to make
of what Dr. Elmore had said, followed him
and the notary into the bank.
`I find here a note of your's, Doctor
Elmore
,'
said the notary, `endorsed by `Hart &
Creech' and `Gilman & Foster;' it is due to
day and unpaid. Not wishing to protest it, I
spoke to you at the door supposing you were
not aware that it was past the hour.'
As he spoke the Notary diplayed the note
before his eyes. Dr. Elmore took it in his
hands and surveyed it with a look of
incredulity
.
He read it, and his own name at the
bottom, with the endorsements `twice over;
and then quietly laid it upon the table, saying
in a voice of singular composure,
`Mr Notary, that note is a forgery.'
`A forgery,' exclaimed Mr. W, the
broker, who had glanced over the note and
seen that it was a counterpart to that he had
that morning discounted; and said
hurriedly
,
`Wait for me here an instant, Dr. Elmore,'
he hurried to his office for the note he had
negotiated
.
`And do you pronounce this name a
forgery
,
Dr. Elmore?' asked the astonished
Notary
,
placing his finger upon the forged
signature
.
`I do, sir,' answered Dr. Elmore firmly.
`Mr. Wnow re-entered and placed
his note before Dr. Elmore.
`Siris that note genuine?' he demanded
in a trembling voice and with a countenance
pale as death.
`No, sir,' answered Dr. Elmore, in a voice
of mingled indignation and astonishment.
`Do you say it is a forgery?'
`I do, sir. They are both base forgeries.
Till this moment I was not aware of the
existence
of either pieces of paper!'
`Both drawn up payable to the order of
`Hart & Creech,' and endorsed by them and
`Gilman & Foster,' said the Notary. `There
is mischief between them. Who do you
suspect
?'
he added, looking at Dr. Elmore, who
was walking up and down past the Cashier's
counter with a thoughtful and troubled
countenance
.
`I cannot tell, sir. Who offered the note
here, sir?'
`Mr. Creech,' answered the Cashier, whom
he addressed.
`And to you, sir?'
`Mr. Creech.'
`Thank God,' answered Dr. Elmore
fervently
.
`I feared it was Henry Hart. My
suspicions are removed. Mr. Hart,
whatever
be the event, is innocent of this crime, and
knows nothing of it be assured gentleman.'
At this moment a carriage drove rapidly
up before the bank and stopped, and out of it
leaped Mr. Hart with blood upon his
forehead
and a haggard and wild couutenance.
CHAPTER VI.
Mr. Hart
having descended from the
carriage
with nervous haste, entered the bank
followed by Dr. Blake. His eyes first fell on
Mr. W, the broker, who had the moment
before returned from his office and was now
holding the forged note at arm's length,
looking
at it the very picture of despair. From
the broker they rested on Dr. Elmore, who
stood talking with the cashier in a stern and
excited manner. The merchant's soul shrunk
within him. His heart failed him. His head
swam round. His limbs refused their office;
and with the agonizing assurance (for it was
certainty rather than suspicion) that all was
discovered, he staggered and caught by the
counter for support. There he stood with a
countenance like the hue of ashes and his gaze
fixed in hopeless despair upon the face of Dr.
Elmore who now turned to survey him. The
emotion of Mr. Hart now fully confirmed the
suspicions of the Cashier and the broker, who
had very freely declared their belief in the
guilt of Mr. Hart. But Dr. Elmore saw in
his weakness only the effect of his recent
accident
.
Although the circumstances were so
strong against him Dr. Elmore could not
believe
him a party to the forgery. In his own
mind he believed Mr. Hart to have been the
victim of Creech's avarice and guilt; for what
little intercourse Dr. Elmore had with this
latter
personage had by no means given him a
high estimate of his moral principle and
integrity
.
He therefore, now turned to Mr.
Hart, whom he, as well as the other
gentlemen
,
were astonished to see come in, with a
kindness and sympathy in his tones that fell
upon his bosom like the dew and the sunshine
upon the withered earth, and said,
`Is it possible, my dear sir, that you are so
much recovered from your fall as to return to
State Street. I am truly gratified to see you.
You are still very pale; and I would advise
you to return home as soon as your business
will permit.'
`I thank you, sir,' answered Henry Hart,
a great load removed from his mind; for such
was Dr. Elmore's manner, that in his heart he
whispered to himself the flattering unction,
`He does not suspect! I am safe! My fears
are groundless.'
`It is peculiarly fortunate Mr. Hart, that
you have been able to return to the bank just
at this crisis,' continued Dr. Elmore, `as a
discovery has just been made which seriously
interests you.'
Henry Hart felt as if all the blood in his
system was rushing to his head. He thought
he should sink to the floor. With a
superhuman
effort he commanded himself, and
attempted
to look Dr. Elmore calmly in the
face. But he could not lift his eyelids,
weighed
down with conscious guilt, from the floor.
His whole frame trembled exceedingly and
his physician placed a chair for him into
which he sank; but all the time struggling
with a great effort to appear calm and turn
aside from himself suspicion. That Dr.
Elmore's
words had reference to the forgeries
that the broker's presence there at that crisis
had connection with it, he was now
convinced
.
A most miserable man was Henry Hart
at that moment. If the floor had gaped
beneath
his chair and plunged him into some
dark cavern where the light of human eyes
could never penetrate his soul, where he
should be insensible to the infamy that was to
blast his name, it would have been a happy
relief to him from the fearful exposure he
dreaded.
`What has occurred?' he faintly
murmured
.
`A most unpleasant affair, I regret to say,
Mr. Hart,' said Dr. Elmore with gentleness.
`A strange, unaccountable occurrence, sir,'
said the broker with warmth, at the same time
approaching Mr. Hart's chair, and looking at
him with the most intense suspicion mingled
with impatience, the forged note held firmly
in one hand and the fore finger of the other
laid impressingly upon the name of the Firm
endorsed upon it.
`I fear Mr. Hart is at present too ill to
listen
to any exciting topic,' said his physician.
`It is best he should know it, sir. His
credit and good name are at stake,' answered
Dr. Elmore. You must prepare yourself, Mr.
Hart, to hear intelligence of no ordinary
import
.
It is painful and will try all your nerves
and self-possession. But in the first place let
me assure you of my full conviction of your
innocence and ignorance of the whole affair.'
Henry Hart, who had groaned once heavily
and covered his forehead with one hand, now
looked up with more confidence; but the
broker vented an ejaculation which seemed to
express a decided and very positive difference
of opinion from that given by Dr. Elmore.
Mr. Hart caught the broker's eye and his
own fell beneath it, while he said falteringly,
`It is true, Dr. Elmore, I am very ill. I
am not, I fear, quite myself. If you will go
into the carriage with me I will there hear
from you any thing you have to state
affecting
my honor and character.'
`I would do that with pleasure if I could,
sir; but it is necessary that the matter should
be settled here. In a word, Mr. Hart, I find
in Mr. Notary's hands here a note for ten
thousand dollars'
`And one in mine for, `interrupted the
impatient broker.
`Patience, Mr. W,' said Dr. Elmore,
checking the angry man, who, anticipating
the loss of nearly ten thousand dollars, was in
no very patient mood.
`I find here, Mr. Hart, a note for ten
thousand
dollars drawn ostensibly by me and
bearing
my name for signature, made payable to
your house, the endorsement of which it also
bears; as well as that of another House, the
head of which has been sent for and will be
here shortly. This is the note,' continued
Dr. Elmore holding before him the forged
paper, `and the signature I have declared and
now again pronounce it to be a
forgery!
'
Dr. Elmore elevated his voice and spoke
the last words with strong emphasis. Every
eye was turned full upon Mr. Hart. He sat
with his eyes upon the ground, one hand in his
vest, as if pressing upon his heart to confine
wild throbbing, the other supporting his
forehead
upon the arm of the chair. There was
a moment's impressive silence. Even Mr.
W, restrained his impatience awaiting a
reply.
`Go on, sir,' hoarsely said Henry Hart
without moving.
`Have you nothing to say, sir?' asked Dr.
Elmore with a countenance expressive of
surprise.
What could the guilty man say? His
thoughts were in a tumult. But the instinct
of self-preservation was lively and he resolved
to save himself.
`Yes, sir, I have something to say,' he
replied
,
rising from his chair and assuming a
face of indignant innocence. `It is that I
feel surprised and grieved that you should
suspect me of having forged a name to a note.'
`I have not suspected you, Mr. Hart,' said
Dr. Elmore warmly; `on the contrary I
expressed
my entire confidence in your
innocence
.
You do me injustice, sir.' And Dr.
Elmore for the first time began to feel
suspicion
.
`You were only questioned as any
other man would be, and would wish to be,
under circumstances so peculiar.'
`It is not surprising, gentlemen, that I
should
feel
, in a case like this,' he answered
with well feigned integrity. `The surprise at
the discovery has deeply moved me. I
pronounce
the note a forgery.'
`You confess it?' exclaimed Dr. Elmore.
`I have no doubt it
is
a forgery,' said the
broker in an ironical under tone.
`Confess itconfess the note? No, sir? Do
you mean to insult me, sir? I pronounce the
endorsement of my firm a forgery.'
`Who presented the note to the bank for
discount, Mr. Cashier?' asked Dr. Elmore.
`Mr. Creech, the Junior Partner.'
`Creech! Then, gentlemen there is no
mystery. I have long had my suspicions of
my partner. I hope you will do me justice to
believe me when I say that I have had till
today
no knowledge of the existence of this
note.'
`Nor of
this
, Mr. Hart?' demanded the
notary who now began to believe in Mr. Hart's
Innocence.
`Mr. Hart glanced at this well known note;
and, in spite of himself his face betrayed him
guilty
to the keenly observing eyes of the
Cashier, who during the whole time had been
watching its changing expressions.
`No, sir,' he faintly answered.
Too late to take up the first note he had
resolved
to deny all knowledge of the notes, and
thus retain the ten thousand dollars he held
in his pocket-book, for his own uses. He
believed
that he could successfully fasten the
whole guilt upon Creech and himself escape
from all suspicion. This idea gave him
confidence
and at the same time audacity.
`Then you pronounce these endorsements
forgeries, Mr. Hart?' asked Dr. Elmore,
exhibiting
the back of the note in his hand and
with his finger pointing to that held by the
broker.
`I do unhesitatingly.'
`And who do you believe to be the forger.'
Mr. Hart hesitated. But feeling that all
were intent upon his answer, he said,
`Who negotiated this note with you Mr.
W?'
`Mr. Creech,' answered the broker.
`Unpleasant as it is for a merchant to
suspect
his partner in business of a crime like
this, the fact that the notes were both offered
by my Junior Partner, Mr. Creech, and are
made payable to our Firm, I feel it my duty
to charge him with being the drawer of both
notes, and the forger of both signatures and
of the endorsements.'
`This is your belief, sir?' asked Dr. Elmore
seriously.
`It is,' answered Henry Hart, looking
round with confidence till meeting the eye of
the Cashier his own fell; and to his confusion
he saw that there was at least one present
who did not believe him innocent of the
forgery
.
At this moment Mr.  of the
Mercantile
House, the endorsement of which was
also on the notes with that of Hart & Creech,
entered the Bank. His surprise at the grave
aspects of the persons present was by no
means lessened when the Notary said,
handing
him the note,
`Mr.  will you have the kindness to
look at this endorsement. The note is already
due as you will perceive.'
The merchant looked at the endorsement
and then read the note. Without hesitation
he pronounced it a forgery. This the Cashier
believed he would do; for in his own mind he
had settled who was the guilty party; but
still in the minds of the rest there was
suspicion
that this house might possibly be the
drawers of the note. But the honest,
indignant
manner in which he pronounced the
endorsement
forged convinced all present that
he was ignorant of the existence of such a
note, and that a double forgery had been
executed
.
The broker now showed his note,
which he also declared a forgery. Suspicion
was now fixed upon Mr. Creech; and Dr.
Elmore and Mr  of the forged Firm and
the broker at once decided to send for an
officer
,
and arrest the Junior Partner at once. A
messenger was at once despatched to the
Police
for officer Clapp. He had been absent
but a few moments when, to the surprise of
all Mr. Creech himself opened the inner green
covered door, and appeared in person.
The long absence of Mr. Hart from the
Counting-House had made this precise, moral,
very conscientious little gentleman
exceedingly
nervous. He felt every thing depended
upon the safe payment of the bank note, to
secure which he had so vigilently exerted
himself and obtained the amount from Mr.
W, the broker. But half an hour had
passed, and Mr. Hart not returning he became
`fidgety,' to make use of a word which is quite
expressive of the state of mind and body the
junior partner was in. He kept repeatedly
going to the door to look up the street, and as
often returning to his desk. But to write was
quite out of the question. He could only
scribble over on a sheet of foolscap, `note,'
`Dr. Elmore,'`Bank,'`$10,000,' and other
words indicative of the current of his thoughts.
At every two minutes he would take out his
gold repeater and look at it. It seemed to him
to have stopped, and he could only assure
himself that it had not by holding it to his
ear. He was about to send a clerk to the
bank to see what had become of Mr. Hart, and
in his mind cursing him for not at once
returning
and relieving his fears as to the fate
of the note, when a merchant came in and
informed
him of Mr. Hart's accident.
`Fiends! when did it happen? How long
ago?' he demanded in consternation.
`It must be nearly twenty minutes ago. I
thought you must have heard of it, and am
surprised you have not learned it. But he
was at once taken to his house.'
`Where did it occur?'
`In the very door of  Bank!'
`Good Heavens! Had he been in?'
`He was crossing the street to the bank
when he fell. He was immediately taken
home in a hack.'
`Excuse me, sir. I must at once go to him.'
Mr. Creech seized his hat and flew towards
the house of his partner. He wanted to learn
from his own lips the fate of the note. He
did not dare to go to the bank. His fears
were in the ascendant. On reaching Mr.
Hart's house and ringing the bell, the servant
confounded him by saying Mr. Hart had not
been at home since morning.
`Has he not met with an accident?'
`We have not heard of it.'
`Was he not brought home in a carriage?'
`No, sir.'
`Strange, exclaimed Mr. Creech, staring
the man in the face. The next moment he
turned from the door leaving the servant to
communicate his words to the family, and up
on them inflict the first blow of the evils
thawere
soon to follow.
Mr. Creech hastened back to his store. On
his way he was more than once stopped by
inquiries after Mr. Hart. `Could it be
possible
that he had been taken to the Hospital
instead
of his house?' he asked himself; for
that he had met with an accident he was now
convinced. On reaching the store and
hearing
nothing from him, and receiving no
message
,
he resolved to relieve his apprehensions
respecting the note, to proceed at once to the
bank and learn it in person. He had a faint
hope that it might have been taken up. At
all events, its fate was by this time decided,
and the sooner he knew what it was the
better
.
He, therefore, assumed all the confidence
he could command and took his way to the
bank. He well knew it was shut for business,
but that he could enter, and from the Notary's
books ascertain how matters had gone, and
what became of his senior partner. He
expected
to find no one in but this person. His
surprise was apparent on coming suddenly
upon the party of persons assembled there.
He stopped full, with his hand on the door,
and rapidly glanced round upon them. The
Cashier was leaning across the bank counter
with a face grave and earnest; near him stood
the notary, in whose hand the junior partner
saw and recognised the forged note; standing
by a chair, supporting himself by the back,
stood Henry Hart, with a pale but hardened
look; and in front of him was Mr. W,
the broker, who held in his hand the note he
had but two hours before negotiated with him.
A few paces off was Dr. Elmore, walking
up and down the floor with a countenance
full of seriousness.
`It is all up,' was the remark Mr. Creech
made to himself, on discovering this aspect of
things. `I must get out of it the best way I
can. I see how it stands now. They have
charged him with it, and he has denied it and
accused me! I see that by his looks. I think
I know my way out now.'
What this way was, which the Junior
Partder
seemed to see so clearly before him in this
crisis of affairs, will be explained in the next
chapter.
CHAPTER VII.
`I am anticipated, I see gentlemen,' said
the Junior partner, speaking with
extraordinary
assurance, and walking up to the bank
counter.
`Anticipated? How do you mean, sir?'
asked Dr. Elmore, fixing his eyes upon him
sternly, while the others waited the result
with curiosity and impatience.
`A sad affair; very!' responded the Junior
Partner shaking his head and glancing out of
his eye towards Mr. Hart, and then looking
confidently round upon the faces of others.
`I was in hopes to be here in time to prevent
an exposure; but I see it is all out. I would
have saved the credit of the house if I could.
But it is too late, I see! Very sad affair,
gentlemen
!
Pray how did you discover it?'
Here the fluent Junoir Partner glanced his
eyes at the Cashier.
`If you speak of these forged notes, Mr.
Creech,' answered the Cashier, `the one held
by the bank was unpaid at the hour due; and
Dr. Elmore being near the notary spoke to
him about it before protesting it.'
`And you pronounced it a forgery, sir,'
inquired
Mr. Creech, turning full upon Dr.
Elmore
and addressing this gentleman with a
countenance filled with well conceived
indignation
at the forgery.
`Yes, sir,' answered Dr. Elmore, perfectly
surprised at the new position affairs seemed to
be tending to.
`You did perfectly right, sir, perfectly right.
I only regret, for the credit of the Firm, that I
did not learn the forgery sooner. As soon as
I discovered it I hastened at once to the bank
to lift the note. But I see it is too late
gentlemen
.'
`And you have only just discovered the note
to be a forgery, sir?' demanded Dr. Elmore,
showing him the note.
`Not ten minutes ago. It was by a mere
accident. A singular accident, very! You
must know, gentlemen, we have been a little
run of late, and have had to get notes
discounted
,
oftener than was safe. Well, you
see gentlemen, this morning we had this note
to pay, a note Mr. Cashier, I presented two
months since for discount. You recollect it
no doubt, that it was I that presented it, and
that I also drew the money.'
`Yes, sir,' answered the Cashier, his
confidence
in the integrity of Mr. Creech greatly
increased by the other's open, can did manner.
`Well, I did not know up to eleven o'clock
how we should meet this note. I knew all our
funds were invested. I asked Mr. Hart what
should be done? He made no reply; but
went out into his counting room. From his
gloomy looks, I was confident, gentlemen,
that he had made no provision to meet the
note. I trembled, I assure you for the credit
of the House of Hart & Creech. I did, I
assure you, gentlemen! A Protest, a Pistol!
That's my creed, gentlemen! I am too
honorable
to survive a protest!' Here the Junior
Partner laid his hand over his heart and
looked
round to receive the silent admiration he
felt they could not withold from a man who so
carefully regarded his honor.
`Well, gentlemen, I walked the store,
thinking
for about ten minutes, and then I went
into the counting-room determined to know
what was to be done. Said I, `Mr. Hart, if
you have made no provision to meet Dr.
Elmore's
note due to-day, why have you not let
me know sooner, so that I could look after it.
I entrusted it to you. He smiled and said to
me, `Mr. Creech, you can do so with entire
confidence. What is the amount of the note
due to-day?' `It is ten thousand dollars,'
said I.
`There is a note for the amount drawn by
the same name. Take it to W  and get
the money. The balance for the discount
will be found in the safe. Did you not say
so, Mr. Hart?'
Abruptly challenged in this manner, and
wholly confounded and overwhelmed by the
statement of Creech, Mr. Hart (who it will be
remembered said these very words to him)
remained
silent.
`I ask you, sir, did you not say these words
to me?'
`You are a villain, sir,' replied Mr. Hart,
looking ghastly and shaking his trembling fist
at him.
Creech smiled scornfully and looked round
in triumph.
`You see, gentlemen, he does not deny it.'
In the opinion of all present, Henry Hart
was the criminal. Mr. Creech was looked
upon as an honest man. Mr. Hart felt the
dark looks of all upon him and hung his head.
The boldness of his Junior Partner
overwhelmed
him. He sat as if a spell was upon
him. Mr. Creech then continued,
`He gave me the note, gentlemen, and I
went out to negotiate it. I took it to you, Mr.
W . You discounted it for me. I returned
with the money to the counting-room'
`A moment, if you please, sir,' said Dr.
Elmore
.
`Certainly, sir,' answered the Junior
Partner
,
bowing with easy and condescending
politeness
.
`Do I understand you that this was the
second
note bearing my signature for the sum
of ten thousand dollars; which you got
discounted
?'
`Yes, sir. The first here at the bank; and
the second to day with Mr. W .'
`And had you no suspicion that either of
the notes were forged?'
`None whatever, sir! I feel I ought to
regard
such a question as an insult, sir. But I
pardon it. When one's name is forged, there
is an excuse for unguarded words.'
`I meant no offence, Mr. Creech.'
`I have taken none, sir.'
`Go on if you please, will you?' exclaimed
the broker impatiently grinding his teeth
together
and darting savage glances towards
Mr. Hart, who felt that any efforts of his owu
towards arresting the tide of feeling in
Creech's favor and against himself would be
unavailing.
`I placed the money in Mr. Hart's hands,
who I saw was very solicitous to take up the
note in person. I could not account for it
then. It is now very plain. He left the
counting-house
a little before close of bank hours,
and said he was going to the bank to take up
the note. Half an hour afterwards I was
drying
a letter on the blotter when an impression
very legibly made upon it arrested my eye. I
took out a pocket mirror to glance at it lest it
should be something secret relating to the
Firm, and well knowing Clerks get a good
many secrets by reading the blotting book with
mirrors, when to my surprise I found it was
the impression of a note of hand signed by Dr.
Elmore, for some thousands of dollars. The
sum and date were not quite so legible as the
rest. Now I well knew Dr. Elmore had not
been in the counting-room and that Mr. Hart
told me he got the note signed at the Doctor's
residence. Now, said I, this this is strange.
How could a man write his name and dry it
on our blotter who has not been in the store:
and who, as Mr. Hart says, did not write it in
the store but at his house! The writing of
the note was in Mr. Hart's hand, but the
signature
that of Dr. Elmore. Yet both dried at
the same time. Now, said I, either Dr.
Elmore
was here and signed that this morning,
while Mr. Hart wrote it, or the signature is a
forgery.'
`But Dr. Elmore might have been there the
day before.'
`Not for six months before without my
seeing
him, or knowing it. I am always in the
counting-room. Dr. Elmore can answer that
question.'
`I have not been in Mr. Hart's
counting-room
for three years at least,' answered Dr.
Elmore, who had listened with the deepest
attention
to Creech's singular statement.
`And this blotting paper led you to suspect
that the note Mr. Hart had given you had
been drawn up and signed by himself?' asked
the Cashier.
`Yes. The instant this painful suspicion
flasbed upon me I thought of the note due in
Bankof Mr. Hart's anxiety to take it up in
person, and I could not but believe that it was
also a forgery! Judge my feelings,
gentlemen
!
A partner in a mercantile house
discovering
circumstances that lead him to suspect
the honesty of his co-partner. A most
delicate
and trying position. If they were
forgeries
,
there was my own name and reputation
involved! What proof could I bring of my
innocence of all participation? Such were
my reflections! While I was thinking upon
this subject a person informed me that Mr Hart
had fallen in the bank door and been removed
to his house insensible! My first thought was
`Had he paid the note?' I thought most,
gentlemen, of the honor of the House at that
moment. I flew hither to learn its fate. If
fortunately taken up to inform Mr. Hart of
my knowledge of his guilty proceedings, warn
him against their repetition and demand that
he should at once obtain funds to take up the
note held by Mr. W. Such was my
intention
,
gentlemen, in coming to the bank. If
I had found the note unpaid it was my
intention
to stop its protest for an hour or two till I
could raise money and get it into my
possession
.
On my entrance I found you all here.
The looks of both parties showed me at a
glance that I was too late! If possible,
gentlemen
,
let the affair rest between us!
Indignant
as I naturally feel I do not care to have
the matter blazed abroad. Mr. Hart's fall, no
doubt alone prevented him from lifting the
note. He has probably got the money about
him now which I obtained for the purpose.
Let me propose, that this be paid to the bank
for the note held; and that Mr. W take
the note of the Firm to secure him, with, if
he pleases, a mortgage upon Mr. Hart's
house.'
This last audacious proposition made Mr.
Hart, guilty and fallen as he felt, start with an
exclamation of indignant astonishment. He,
however, only half rose from his chair and
then sat down again muttering something
which no one understood.
`The Bank cannot receive money so
obtained
,
Mr. Creech,' said the Cashier.
`But
I
can receive it,' answered the broker.
`It is mine! I will have it! The note of
your firm you may give to the bank, if you
please!'
`Mr. Creech will not insult the bank by
offering the note of a house so dishonored,'
answered Dr. Elmore. `Pardon me, Mr.
Creech, in using this term I do not reflect
upon
you.'
`No, sir. Innocence never suspects! I
did not mistrust that you did, Dr. Elmore.
You speak truly. Our house
is
dishonored.
It shall be my first act to have cancelled the
papers of our co-partnercy. I cannot too soon
leave a position in which I am disgraced.'
`Mr. Hart give me up my money!'
demanded
the broker going towards the Merchant,
who, although Creech's account was rife with
falsehood, had felt there was too much truth
in it, for him to attempt to exculpate himself.
`Stay Mr. W ,' said Dr. Elmore
`There will be an officer here in a few
minutes
.'
`I will be my own officer,' answered the
broker, seizing Mr. Hart by the collar. `My
money, sir!'
`It is in this pocket-book, Mr. W' he
answered, placing it in the broker's hands.
With a smile of joy Mr. W flew to
the counter with it and began to run over the
amount. There was just ten thousand
dollars
,
which he announced to all. This
intelligence
corroborated the Junior Partner's
story
;
and the fact that with this sum in his
pocket
book he was coming to take up the forged
note, was a confirmation of his guilt and of
the truth of Mr. Creech's account. All
present
believed the latter innocent and the
former
alone criminal.
`Here is the amount of discount, sir,' said
the overjoyed broker on recovering his
money
;
and placing the hundred dollars back in
the pocket book he returned it to Mr. Hart,
transferring the nine thousand and nine
hundred
dollars to his own.
`You are satisfied now, Mr. W, I
trust?' asked Mr. Creech, smiling.
`Quite so, Mr. Creech,' replied the happy
broker laughing and heartily shaking the
Junior
Partner by the hand. `But a sad affair
this for poor Hart.'
`Very.'
At this moment an officer of Police came
into the bank. He was a stout built man of
the middle height, well knit together and of
compact frame. He wore a box overcoat and
fur cap. His face was florid full, and might
be called handsome. Its expression was of
mingled good feeling and determination;
courage
and gentleness combined!the very
compound
for a police officer, whom most people
(and themselves too sometimes) think must
be a brute.
The officer glancing round rested his eye
longest on Creech, which was an attention
this gentleman by no means felt flattered by.
But Police officers are physiognomists. In
his mind the officer set the Junior Partner
down as his man. He, however, walked strait
to the counter where stood the Cashier who
had sent after him.
`An unpleasant occurrence, Mr. Clapp.'
`What is it?' he asked, glancing again
penetratingly
at the Junior Partner.
`A forgery.'
`Who is the complainant? The criminal I
think I see here.'
`The Bank; and others also.'
`Did you bring a warrant with you?'
`Yes.'
`Dr. Elmore shall you prosecute?'
This gentleman was at that moment
painfully
regarding the unhappy Henry Hart;
who from the moment the police officer
entered
had sunk his head upon his breast and
sat with his hands clasped together the very
picture of hopeless despair. Dr. Elmore was
thinking of his family, and deeply
commisserating
them. He also was thinking upon his
wife, his childrenfor whom he had given his
hand to crime, with the bitterest agony that
could torture the human bosom.
`Shall you prosecute, Doctor Elmore?'
repeated
the Cashier.
`No,' he answered with feeling.
`And you Mr. ,' he asked of the
partner
of the house whose endorsement had been
forged.
`Most certainly we shall prosecute,
answered
Mr. W with great positiveness.
`The Bank will do so also, as it will be the
only loser by the forgery. Mr. Clapp you
will take into custody Henry Hart, now in
this room, and safely keep him until the will
of the Directors is known.'
`With what do you charge him, sir?' asked
the officer, looking towards Creech, who a
third time meeting the eye of the constable,
lost his audacity, looked really guilty.
`With a forgery.'
Mr. Hart was seated and partly hidden by
the form of Dr. Elmore, who had turned to
speak to him with reference to his family.
The officer did not therefore regard him on
whom the Cashier's eyes had turned; but
without hesitation walked strait up to Mr.
Creech and laid his hand upon his shoulder.
The Junior Partner started and turned pale.
`You mistake, sir,' he said trying to smile.
`There is your prisoner!' and he pointed to
Mr. Hart.
The officer looked towards the Cashier for
explanation.
`You are wrong, Mr. Clapp! The
gentleman
in the chair.'
The officer bowed an apology which the
Junior Parter graciously accepted, and
approaching
Mr. Hart, arrested him. The
merchant
moved not. With his face in his hands
he groaned heavily and then rose up.
`He is too ill to be taken to prison, sir,' said
his physician. `He has just received a
severe
fall and is still suffering from the effects
of it. Perhaps it could be arranged ao that
on could remain with him to-night at his
redence
.'
`This arrangement can be made,' answered
Dr. Elmore with praise philanthrophy.
The gentlemen present will consent to it.
desides it would be grateful to his poor wife
to have him with her a little longer. You can
keep him in safe custody there, Mr. Officer.'
`Yes.'
`You shall be well remunerated for your
time.'
`I only desire to do my duty. If the
physician
here says it would be dangerous to lodge
him in prison to-night, and the prosecutors
will give me permission to keep guard over
him in his own dwelling, I am perfectly
willinh
to comply with their wishes.'
The same carriage which had brought
Henry
Hart to the Bank, now departed with him
in the custody of a police officer and his
physician
,
to which said party Dr. Elmore also
added himself, that he might in person,
before
they entered the house, gently break to
his wife, the painful intelligence of her
husband's
fall from integrity and honor.
CHAPTER VIII.
We will briefly pass over the heart-rending
scene that took place in the house of Henry
Hart on his arrival there in the custody of an
officer of police. Gently as Dr. Elmore had
endeavored to prepare his wife for the blow,
it came upon her mind with such force that
she became nearly insensible. Devotedly
attached
to him who had always been to her a
kind husband and to his children a fond father,
she could not at first comprehend that he was
a criminal and in the hands of justiceshe
could not believe that he whom she had looked
upon as the very soul of honor, as the
model
for an honorable merchant, could have
fallen!
`Forged! forged a note? forged names of
others in Bank? Did you utter these words,
Doctor Elmore? Say I fancied I heard them!
Say I did not hear them. Tell me you did not
speak them!' and she caught both his hands
in hers and wildly, earnestly clasped them in
hers and gazed in his face as if she would
read there life or death.
`Be calm, madam, I entreat you. It is, alas,
too true!'
`True! oh, God!
true!
Tell me it is true
that my husband is a forger and then bid me
be calm! Where is he? Where is my
husband
?
Where is Henry? Have they dragged
him to prison?'
`No. He is in the hall with the officer.
But be calm! Be composed, dear madam, at
least for your children's sake!'
She rushed to the door of the drawing room,
Dr. Elmore had sent for her with the request
to see her there alone. She threw it nervously
open and beheld her husband. Regardless of
the presence of the officer and physician,
forgetful
of his crime, she bounded forward and
threw herself wildly into his arms.
Self-condemned
,
broken and degraded the miserable
husband hardly dared to return the embrace.
He stood passive, his face covered with the
palm of his hand, while she bathed the other
with tears and covered it wish kisses.
`Thisthis is too much!' he cried in a
sudden
burst of agony. `If you had spurned me
if you had hated me, Ann! I could have
borne it! But to be thus loved, guilty wretch
that I am, is too much for me to bear!'
These words were heard by Dr. Elmore and
his physician with surprise. Both had some
hopes yet of his innocence. But he had now,
under the impulse of his feelings made a
direct
confession of his criminality. Dr.
Elmore
turned away with a sad heart. The last
hope was gone. From his own mouth had
come the voluntary confession of his guilt.
His heart bled for the wifethe still young
and beautiful wife and mother, who clung to
the guilty man with a devotion which rose
superior to every consideration of
unworthiness
in the object. The love of a wife is like
the love of God. No crimeno
unworthiness
no
degree of moral guilt can move it
from its object.
There remained yet a new trial to the
merchant's
feelingsthe trial of his paternal
heart. The younger children, whom we have
introduced to the reader in the first chapter of
this truthful tale, to which they are desired to
refer, the curly headed handsome Tommy of
eight years, and the sylph-like Grace two
years younger, now came in from the nursery,
where an intelligent nurse performed also the
part of a governess to them. Hearing, in the
midst of their lesson the uplifted voice of their
mother in the hall, they ran down stairs in
alarm to learn the cause. Ellen, the eldest
daughter, also flew from her room where she
was engaged in coloring a landscape. The
younger children seeing their parents
overwhelmed
with grief, and unable to
comprehend
the cause, clung around them and
mingled
their cries with their tears. Ellen stood
a moment transfixed with surprise and painful
alarm as she saw the gentlemen gathered
round them. She recognized both Dr. Elmore
and the physician; and then she feared her
father had been hurt. It may be necessary to
observe here, in passing, that the servant whom
Mr. Creech had seen at the door, had been so
discreet as not to alarm the family by
reporting
Mr. Creech's words respecting the
accident
,
whom he believed had been misinformed,
knowing if Mr. Hart had really been hurt his
wife would hear of it full soon enough Her
father's paleness confirmed her in this idea,
and full of affectionate solicitude the
beautiful
girl flew towards him. She was arrested
by the gentle grasp of Dr. Elmore upon her
wrist. She turned a look of earnest inquiry
upon him.
`Ellen, my child! come with me a moment
into this room,' he said in a tone that sunk to
her heart.
She felt a weight oppress her very soul at
his words. She turned, she knew not why, a
look of timidity and awe towards her father
and then suffered him to lead her into the
parlor
.
She instinctively felt that some evil had
befallen the householdsome sorrow greater
than any accident to life or limb! The faces
of all aroundthe anguish of her mother
the gloomy and fallen countenance of her
father
all
were eloquent with some woe, her
young heart could not divinebut the
apprehension
of which made her tremble like a
leaf, as she gave her hand into that of the
benevolent
old gentleman. As she went with
him she met her mother's gaze! It was full,
all full of woe and pity!
He closed the door and led her to a seat.
She thought she should suffocate. The
shadows
of the cloud of woe fell darkly over her
spirit. He took a seat by her side. What
fearful communication was about to be made?
She clasped his hands and looked into his face
with the most pleading deprecating
expression
.
She could not speak; but her looks
said, `Oh tell me nothing evil! tell me noth
ing that will break my heart, as I know my
mother's heart is broken!'
Dr. Elmore understood her emotion. He
tried more than once to speak, but his feelings
overcame him. The tears trickled silently
down his venerable face and fell drop by drop
upon the golden head of his staff.
`Ellen, my sweet child, you must gather all
your energies and be firm!' he said in a voice
deeply moved.
`What fearful thing has happened? My
father
!it
is of him you would speak! Oh,
what is it, sir?'
`It makes my heart bleed to tell you, but it
is better you should know it and from me.'
`Tell me all! I can bear it! Is it that he
has lost his property? Oh, that is no evil,
such as some nameless one I seem to dread!
I can work and do much to support him! Tell
me all!
`Would it were but the loss of his property,
sweet child! In a word, your father has lost
his honor and good name!'
`My father dishonored? It cannot be,'
exclaimed
the daughter with a noble spirit
animating
her face.
`Alas, it is too true. He has been tempted
to use the names of merchants without their
permission,' said Dr. Elmore conveying to her
the father's crime as delicately as he could
`And is this a dishonor, sir? I do not quite
understand itbut it may be so, sir,' she said
thoughtfully. I do not know what it is to
use a merchant's name without his
permission
.'
Dr. Elmore saw that he had failed to
convey
to the young girl the idea he had
intended
.
`Your father is accused of
forgery
,' he said
as firmly as his emotion would permit. He
saw that she now perfectly comprehended him.
And painful indeed was the evidence which
assured him of the fact. She sat before him
without motion. Her eyes were fixed rigidly
upon his face, but there was no expression
there. They were as eyes of brilliant glass.
Her cheek at the word had changed to the
hue of marble. Her lips lost their color, but
moved tremulously with the mechanical
repetition
of the scarce audible word which had
acted so like an evil spell upon her. Doctor
Elmore gazed upon her with intense alarm.
He condemned himself for abruptness.
He spoke soothingly to her. She gave no
signs of intelligence. Only her lips moved
with the repetition of the fatal word that had
last fallen from his own.
`Ellen! dear child do not let this sad news
so deeply affect you!'
`Forgery! forgery! forgery! forgery!'
responded
continually the statue-like figure
before
him, the voice thrilling the very soul with
its low, touching pathos.
He took her hands; they were as cold as
those of the dead. He laid his hand upon her
temples, which burned with unnatural heat.
He raised her in his arms, and laying her
upon
the sofa, went to the door, and in an under
tone called to a servant to send Dr Blake to
him; those who were in the hall having gone
into the library, the door of which was closed.
On the physician's appearance, Dr. Elmore,
who himself had not practised for many years,
informed him briefly of Ellen's situation and
its cause. A vein was immediately opened in
the temples, friction applied to the hands, and
in a little while the alarming symptoms
disappeared
.
The rigid, unwinking eye fell and
gently closed, the lips ceased to move,
articulating
the fatal word, and a state of total
physical
prostration succeeded, attended with
partial
insensibility. It became necessary to
make known to the already sufficiently
wretch-wife
the condition of her child. Dr. Elmore
went for her. He found her in the library.
Henry Hart was laying utterly prostrated in
body and spirit, upon a settee. She had
placed
the softest pillows beneath his head; and
was now seated by him, soothing him with
words of devoted love, every one of which
pierced his soul like sharp steel, bathing his
feverish temples, and by every solace in her
power endeavoring to heal the bruised and
guilty spirit. He could only lay and hide his
face, and at intervals murmur an entreaty to
be forgiven by her.
`Think not of me, Henry,' she said `You
have erred. You have sinned. We are all
liable to be temptedall liable to fall! God
has seen fit to leave you to yourself. But he
has not deserted you! Your wife still loves
you. To her you can never be guilty, so long
as the guilty are pardoned by our Heavenly
Father! so long as remains on record this
promise, `if any man sin we have an Advocate
with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.'
`Do not speak so kindly! I cannot bear the
gentle tones of your voice, Ann!'
`It is because you feel your guilt, Henry!
This sense of unworthiness is the first step to
repentence.'
`I do sincerely repent. Not because I am
detectednot because I have a prison and a
trial before menot because I have made
myself
a by-word among men, but for the grief
and the woe and the anguish I have brought
upon youupon my dear children! I think
not of my own personal degredation. It is
swallowed up in the misery and disgrace my
conduct has brought upon those I most love.
And yet, I put my hand to this crime on your
accounton their account! I was
unfortunate
I
was bankrupt. I could not
contemplate
the poverty and loss of position in
society
which would be yours, if I made known
my affairs. I had not the courage to tell you
we must leave this fine mansion and take
humble lodgings; that you must sink to a
level with the poor and the humble? I could
not convey to your ears, Ann, intelligence so
painful.'
`Oh, that you had done so, Henry! You
would then have escaped crime! You need
not have feared for me? A wife who truly
loves her husband will listen to his tale of
sudden loss and poverty without any other
feeling than for her husband. She loves
herself
in him. She will only feel for him, think
of his unhappinessof his fall of pride. Her
heart will bleed for him; her sympathies will
all be awakened in his behalf. What to the
truly loving wife is money when her husband
is unhappy? Oh, Henry, I would have
listened
to your tale of poverty so far as myself was
concerned without any emotion or regret save
only on your account'
`Your children?'
`Our lot would become their's! And
Providence
would be nearer to us than before. The
poor have higher and holier claims on our
Father
who is in Heaven than the rich; hence
it is a blessing to be poor if we only knew it
and had faith and grace rightly to improve the
blessing. Oh, Henry, how greatly have you
erred in not coming to me from the very first.
If you had told me of your embarrassments,
I might have advised you. At least you would
not have fallen into this fearful temptation.'
`But, I did not think you understood any
thing about business. You could not have
comprehended my complicated business
arrangements
.'
Womenwives especially who feel
interested
in thier husband's happiness, have more
intelligence than men give them credit for.
They view a subject even so mysterious as a
merchant's business, in a calm, common sense,
unprejudiced light, which often form a variety
of causes he himself is unable to do. Besides,
there is no subject will not be regarded in an
entirely new aspect when for the first time
presented to a mother's mind. A hundred
avenues and ways and means which the
merchant
has overlooked may be discovered by
the clear, calm judgment and feminine
penetration
of his wife. Besides, all men need
advisers
,
and all sensible men feel the necessity
of a person with whom they can at all times
hold council. But few men are to be freely
trusted. Who then so appropriateso good
a counsellor as a wife? Who so likely to give
him honest council? You may say she has no
knowledge of business. True. But her love
and her devotion to her husband will be to her
both wisdom and understanding.'
`She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and
in her tongue is the law of kindness.
`She doeth him good and not evil all the
days of her life.
`
The heart of her husband doth safely trust
in her
.'
It was at this moment Dr. Elmore entered
the room. The officer was standing by a
distant
window looking out.
`I would speak with you a moment,
madam
,'
said Dr. Elmore in a low voice. A
sudden
paleness spread over her features. She
rose and silently left the room with him.
Henry Hart followed her with this eyes and
then covering his face groaned aloud,
`Incomparable woman! Wretch that I am!
Oh, that I had made a confident of my wife
from the first! I should at least have been
protected from crime! I am unworthy to be
the object of her love! I could curse myself
for my guilt! And my children! My sweet
angel, Ellen! She has not come to see me!
She avoids her father who has entailed upon
her infamy! And my little ones! They looked
upon me with fear and timidity and crept to
their mother, as if already they understood
that I was unworthy to be called their father!
They have taken them away! I am alonea
prisoner! I do not wish to see them again!
But Ellen!that she, my heart's child
should shun me is a blow heavier than I can
bear! But I deserve it! I am a
forger!
Should that pure innocent girl rest upon a
forger's bosom? Officer!'
`Sir.'
`Take me hence to prison! I shall go mad
here!'
`Is it your wish?'
`Yes. I cannot stay here surrounded by
my family At once take me away! Look me
in the darkest dungeon you can have access
to! Shut me out from the light of heaven!
What have I to do with the innocent and good
around me! What have I to do with the pure
sunshine!'
Dr. Elmore took Mrs. Hart by the hand as
he entered the hall, and said,
`Madam, I am grateful to God who has
endued
you with such strength at this trying
hour. Your fortitude surprises me and
commands
my respect. But you are yet called
upon to suffer additional grief. Your sweet
daughter on learning from me the painful
intelligence
was so overcome by the shock that
she now lies in a very critical state.'
`Where?' she asked with a calmness that
led him to suspect that it was unnatural and
the result of sensibility to the comprehension
of any heavier grief. She read his thoughts
and said with a gentle smile and upward
glancing
of her tearful eyes,
`It is Godand he sustains me!'
Dr Elmore bowed his silvery head before
the majesty of Christian faith, and preceded
her into the presence of her child.
CHAPTER IX.
We
have now brought our chief character
Henry Hart, to the crisis towards which his
career had been gradually and steadily
advancing
.
We have followed him from his
first act of duplicity and criminal secrecy
touching the deranged condition of his
mercantile
affairs, through all the subsequent acts
it gave rise to, till forgery crowned them and
detection and arrest followed. It is not our
intention to indulge in reflections upon his
moral turpitude, or dwell upon the danger of
a first act of criminal duplicity. This story
carries with it its own moral; and will
suggest
its own proper reflections in the mind of
the reader. We shall now proceed to show
the consequences of guilt, as affecting those
who are cannected with the guilty by the ties
of consanguinity. No man lives for himself,
more particularly the husband and the father.
When such fall, they pull down with them
many a bright head, crush in their descent
many a pure and guileless heart.
Henry Hart, from his magnificent mansion,
was removed to a prison. In the solitude of
his cell he had time for reflection; and
bitterly
did he lament his first act of deception.
The thought of the wretchedness and infamy
he had brought upon his wife and children
acted like fire in his bosom. He was tortured
which way soever his thoughts were turned.
He strove to drown reflection; but each
moment
the pale face of his noble wife bending
above him in silent agony, feeling more for
him than for herself; the shrieks of his
daughter
;
the wondering looks and timid gaze of
his children rose ever before his mind's vision
and drove him to madness!
Thus he passed the first night of his
incarceration
.
Scarcely less wretched was that
spent within his princely mansion. In vain
the gorgeous mirrors, the sumptuous tables of
marble, the splendid carpets, the costly
chandaliers
,
the lavish opulence and elegance of
the drawing rooms, to comfort and assuage
the grief of the stricken family. Yet to
preserve
this displaythis outward show, had
Henry Hart committed the crimes for which
he was that moment in prison. Each object,
on the contrary, as it met the hapless wife's
eyes, as she hung over her child's couch,
pierced her soul with pangs of distress. So
the night wore away! the poor wife now
weeping
over her daughter, who would not be
comforted
;
now mourning for her degraded
husband
torn from her by the stern power of
offended
justice.
What reader will not say from his heart.
`How much happier would this unhappy
family have been at this moment occupying a
single room in a poor tenement, with humble
but honestly earned fare, than surrounded as
they were by all the manifestations of wealth!'
Yet to escape this humble poverty Henry Hart
had put his hand to forged paper, and was now
the occupant of a felon's cell. In no instance
in the experience of mankind has a wrong act
brought the happiness for the attainment of
which it was committed; but on the contrary,
has placed the doer of it in a more painful
position
than he was at the first. This is a truth,
laid down by Holy Scripture and
corroborated
by the daily experience of evil doers. Let
men in business, let men out of business, bear
it well in mind? If Henry Hart had adopted
and believed this truth, he would not have
been, maybe a poor man, but he would have
been a poor
honest
man! He was now poor
but alas! poor and guilty!
We will briefly pass over the events
succeeding
his arrest. Dr. Elmore with noble
disinterestedness offered himself his bail,
which was set at the large sum of $10,000.
But Mr. Hart firmly refused to be bailed out.
`I have offended the laws. It is but just I
suffer the full penalty due to my crime!
Besides
what have I to do in the world? Men
have no more confidence in me! I am
unworthy
to be re-united with my injured family!
Let me remain here in prison! These walls
are in unison with my spirit.'
But confinement, reaction of long excited
feeling, united with deep remorse of
conscience
,
after a few days brought on a violent
attack of fever and delirium. Hour after hour
did his faithful wife stand over his low couch
in the prison, and administer to his wants.
While the daily press, and the groups in the
streets were loud in their condemnation and
unspairing in their epithets, she who suffered
most, murmured not, nor looked reproach. At
length his disease grew alarming and his
physicians
removed him to the jailor's dwelling,
where after suffering night and day for several
days his erring career terminated in death.
In the meanwhile his house and furniture
were attached and a few days after his burial,
were sold at auction to which flocked all the
fashionable ladies in the city who were
unfeeling
enough to forget at what sacrifice of
domestic happiness this mansion had been
laid open to the public eye? How few
sympathized
with the disgraced and widowed
Mrs. Hart, who, while her rooms were
thronged
with thoughtless purchasers, was with her
children occupying a room in the basement
bathed in tears. The same evening Dr.
Elmore
came for them in a carriage and took
them to a small but neat house in a humbler
part of the city, which with characteristic
delicacy he had fitted up and plainly
furnished
with every comfort, but without any
luxuries
.
Here, in the education of her children and
assisted by Ellen in giving lessons to a few
pupils whom her friend Dr. Elmore obtained
for her, Mrs. Hart endeavored to forget her
unhappiness and to find that solace in her
children of which she had been deprived in
her husband. None who knew her in her
prosperity now came nigh her, and this
neglect
was to her sensitive mind a great relief.
Her few acquaintances were formed among
the humble and contented neighbors around
her; and she sought to forget that she had
ever moved in any other sphere. Dr. Elmore,
whose name she taught her children to mingle
with their little prayers and for whom the
beautiful Ellen felt the affection of a child
towards
an honored father, used occasionally to
visit them. He had wisely refrained from
offering
her any assistance beyond that of his
first act of benevolence in placing them in
their new abode, and getting her pupils; and
he knew that such was the independent
character
of Mrs. Hart she would have refused
any pecuniary aid he might have offered.
Two years Mrs. Hart thus supported
herself
by teaching and her needle, assisted by
Ellen, who had now become a remarkably
beautiful girl of eighteen. There is, however,
no certain repose to any one in this life.
Changes chase each other like the clouds, and
vicissisitudes are as much the lot of man as
sunshine and showers. Dr. Elmore had,
doubtless, the intention in prospect in
making
his will to make such a bequest as should
enable Mrs. Hart to live more easily; and
perhaps settle upon her the tenement in which
she lived, which was his own and which he
had suffered her to occupy gratuitously. But
this intention was prevented from being
carried
into execution. Dr. Elmore with all his
benevolence of character and excellence as a
man and a christian had in common with
many men an undefined feeling of reluctance
to making a will while in good health; as if
from a secret fear that death would soon
follow
.
He, therefore, put it off from year to
year, anticipating a gradual decline which
should both forewarn him of approaching
dissolution
and give him time to arrange his
affairs
.
`But man proposes and God disposes.'
One pleasant spring morning as this
gentleman
was leaving his dwelling to make a visit
to Mrs. Hart, to inform her that he had
obtained
a very desirable situation for Ellen as
a governess, he fell upon the steps in an
apoplectic
fit, and being conveyed into the house
died in a few minutes.
The grief which the death of their
benefactor
caused the objects of his benevolence was
sincere and profound. He had been to them
like a fatherand a friend. He was the
centre
around which their affections entwined
themselves; the object of their purest
gratitude
.
Circumstances soon proved to them
how great a loss they had met with. Their
benefactor stepping from the very first
between
them and the cold world, had turned
aside its shafts from their breasts; and
guarded
by his friendly beneficence they had not
suffered from their sudden fall and deep
affiction
,
all that otherwise they would have
experienced
.
But now they were destined to feel deeply
and keenly the privations of friendless
poverty
;
to which is added the heartless
whisperings
of the reproving, who with utter want
of charity were disposed to heap upon the
wife and children the infamy of the husband
and father's act.
Dr. Elmore's estate fell into the hands of
administrators, his son Edward being at the
time of his decease absent in Europe where,
after completing his medical studies under his
father's eye, he had gone for the purpose of
completing his knowledge of surgery and me
dicine in the Hospitals of Paris.
Administrators, like corporations, are too
often without souls. The administrators on
the estate of Dr. Elmore were men of
substance
and respectability, business men, and
familiar with their duties They went to work
in a business way to settle up the estate. It
may truthfully be said of them as Scripture
said of the Pharaoh who ruled after Joseph's
death:
`And now there rose up a new king over
Egypt who knew not Joseph.' These men
knew not the widow of Dr Elmore's
beneficence
.
In the investigation of the real estate
the tenement occupied by Mrs. Hart was
found to be a portion of it. They learned that
it had been two years occupied by a Mrs. Hart
widow of the notorious Henry Hart, who
had been imprisoned for forgery and died
before
trial.
`Ah, I am surprised Dr. Elmore should
have rented a house to such a person,' said
Mr. Straitpurse, who was a man of money
being a bank-director; who was a man of
piety; being a church member and notorious
for long prayers at the monthly concerts; and
a man of feeling; for he
felt
for every poor
body, and all they got was feeling! `We
must see into it, and see if the rent has been
regularly paid on quarter day.'
`Suppose we call by as we go down to State
street. The house is in our way: and I should
like to see personally all the property that
comes under our control,' said Mr.
Straitbrim
;
who had been a wholesale grocer and
was now President of an Insurance
Compapany
.
Finding in his outset in life religion
convenient he passed for a quaker on the
faith of his grandfather, who had been of that
sect; and he therefore, wore a low strait
collar
to his coat and a white cravat tied very
precisely in a single bow in front; a white
hat something broad in the brim; and drab
pantaloons. Thus he let his garb go in the
world's eye in the place of religious
profession
;
and under the mark of rigid morality
enriched himself by ways and means that
would not stand very well the test that will
analyse human motives and actions at the
final judgement.
Such were the Pharisees into whose hands
Mrs. Hart had fallen. She was seated in the
lower back room of the little two story house
which Dr. Elmore's benevolence had
sheltered
her and her little ones in from the storms
of a heartless and finger-pointing world,
sewing
upon a garment she had taken to make,
and feeling deeply her loneliness, and the
entire
dependence of her children upon her
feeble
efforts; Ellen was in the same room
practising
,
with a sad heart, upon a piano, Dr.
Elmore
had hired for her, a piece of difficult
music she was to teach her pupils that
afternoon
.
Tommy and Grace, the first in his
eleventh year and the other nine, were at
public schoolthat noble institution of our
free land, which is the foundation of its
greatness
and power; where the poorest can
obtain
knowledge side by side with the rich; the
son of the wood-sawyer drink in wisdom and
strength at the same fountain with the `
merchant
prince!'
The room was furnished very plain but
perfectly
neat; and a few flower pots of rose
geranium
and heliotrope were in the windows.
Mrs. Hart though pale and serious had lost
none of her refined beauty, which was re
vived in her daughter, than whom few
maidens
in Boston were more lovely. Her
person
was singularly graceful, and though she
wore a calico dress, no one would have
noticed
that it was not of the richest cashmere;
for her face alone drew the attention of the
observer. It was refined in character, and
purity and gentleness dwelt there as if in
their native heaven! Her smile was full of
sweetness, and her fine blue eyes beamed with
intelligence and feeling. Her face was
intellectual
without being severe; it was
wisdom
blended with love. Her complexion was
brilliant, and the soft glow of her cheek
rivalled
the rose in delicacy of color. But the
chief beauty of Ellen Hart was her glorious
cloud of hair. Its hue was neither brown,
nor auburn, nor chesnut, but a blending of
the three with a golden radiance that played
richly upon it at every movement of her head.
It was not its hue alone that made it
beautiful
!
It was of the softest texture, and when
in sportiveness little Grace would come
behind
her as she sat at the piano and steal out
the comb that scarce held its rich weight, it
would fall like a mantle over her shoulders
and sweep the floor! She had worn it free on
her neck until she was fifteen, when its length
compelled her to bind it up.
It was now braided and tastefully
intertwined
,
braid within braid, fold within fold, and
fastened in a sort of quadruple bow, resting
low upon her neck; a style as tasteful as it
was graceful.
They were thus occupied, mother and
daughter, when a knock was heard at the
door.
CHAPTER X.
The knock on the door was heavy and
peremptory
.
It was one of those authoratative
knocks that are peculiar to landlords on poor
tenant's doors. Before Ellen could leave her
piano stool to answer it, the door opened and
in walked the two administrators, Mr
Straitpurse
first and Mr Staitbrim following him and
closing the door behind them. He walked
through the little entry into the small back
room without invitation, Ellen retreating from
before them in awe and curiosity. `Who could
those two cold stern looking men be? and
what could they want?' were her rapid,
alarmed self-inquiries. Mrs Hart at once
recognised
the former, having in her better days
been on terms of visiting with his lady. She
rose up with a fluttering heart, and that
instinctive
foreboding of evil which the
unfortunate
and unhappy are so quick to feel, and
with something of her former grace and
dignity
offered them chairs, all the while
wondering
to what circumstance she owed the
honor of their visit.
`Hum! ahem!' grummed and hemmed Mr
Straitpurse, as he looked frowningly around
the neat little apartment and upon the open
piano, the flower pots in the window, and one
or two small-framed pictures of Ellen's skill
and taste over the mantle. Mr Straitpurse
thought poor people of necessity must be
squalid
,
have every thing unpainted, discolored, dank
and uninviting; and generally the poor have
little heart to keep things neat, and have little
practical knowledge of economy. But to the
educated poor, neatness is as cheap as
untidiness
;
and over poverty good taste throws a
veil that not only conceals wretchedness but
gives a simple elegance. The comfort and
cleanliness of this little setting room; the
driven whiteness of the half curtains and the
white fringed diaper that covered the bureau;
the order and neatness in the furniture,
conveyed
to this gentleman the idea of
extravagance
and expenditure quite beyond what he
supposed the means of a woman who had not
paid rent for two years would authorise. He,
therefore, grummed and knitted his brows and
after frowning at the piano, the flowers, and
the pictures, he cast a frowning glance both
at Mrs. Hart and her daughter, and took the
chair she had so politely placed for him. Mr.
Straitbrim also looked round with a shrewd,
inquisitive eye upon the room and the inmates,
looked at Mr. Straightpurse, caught that
gentleman's
eye, and then both gentlemen `
ahemmed'
very significantly and decidedly.
Ellen in the meanwhile had retreated to her
piano-stool, from which she sat looking with
surprise and anxious alarm at the two
strangers
;
whose appearance cast a cloud over their
little home, and chilled her young heart with
sad forebodings. Mrs. Hart had seen their
glances around the room, their frowns, and
their interchange of looks. She resumed her
seat in the low rocking chair which she had
before occupied, with a chill at her heart. Mr
Straitbrim did not sit down. This gentleman
was of opinion that he spoke with more
authority
and power in a standing posture than
a setting one; and as he was a tall man he
certainly had the advantage of looking down
upon most to whom he spoke, especially
females
and small men, whom he took a special
pleasure in talking down to, I mean if they
were poor and in his power, or wanted
favors
of him.
`Ahem!hum-hu-hu-grumm!' commenced
Mr. Straitpurse looking across the narrow
space between himself and Mrs. Hart, and
trying to overawe this lady in the outset.
`Hum, hum, humguphum!' echoed Mr.
Straitbrim, increasing the emphasis of his
echo, by bringing his silver-headed cane down
upon the floor with a force that made Ellen's
heart jump to her mouth.
Mrs. Hart felt something was to follow these
premonitory signals, which would call upon
her for resolution and that christian patience
which had sustained her thus far through the
bitter trials which had been hers. She silently
sent a petition to heaven for strength to meet
whatever new evil might now be sent upon
her. She felt at once composed, and prepared
to listen.
`Madam, your name is Hart,' said Mr.
Straitpurse.
`Yes, sir.'
`Your husband was Henry Hart, the Forger?'
`Sir, I am the widow of Henry Hart,' she
answered with a calm dignity (while her heart
swelled) that had its effect upon the
interrogator
.
He colored and looked at Straitbrim, who
said boldly
`Madam, we did not expect to find you
retaining
any pride. Sorry to see it in your
condition. Henry Hart was a forger and died
in prison. You are his widow and it does you
little credit in the eyes of the respectable
members of the community to endeavor to
conceal it!'
Here Straitbrim looked at Straitpurse for
approval. Straitpurse nodded the expected
approving nod; for both were respectable
members of the community!
`Gentlemen, if you have called upon me
on business,' said Mrs. Hart with firmness,
while she keenly felt the insult, `I should be
happy to listen to you. But I cannot sit
here to have my feelings wounded.'
`Tut, tut, madam,' said Mr. Straitpurse
`you must not put on airs. A forger's widow
is a forger's widow! We
have
come to see
you on business. We are the administrators
on the estate of the late Dr. Elmore!'
At the mention of this venerated name
Mrs. Hart turned pale and sighed deeply.
`You knew him, madam?' asked, or rather
affirmed, Mr. Straitbrim, in a much stronger
voice than the simple words he spoke
required
.
But Mr. Straitbrim always spoke to
the poor and the unfortunate in a loud, strong
voice.
`Yes, sir, I owe to him every thing. He
was my best benefactor.'
`Humph! no doubt! This house is his in
which you are living?' and he glanced up at
the ceiling and around at the windows and
wainscoating.
`It is, sir,' answered Mrs. Hart with an
effort
;
for the sense of pending affliction
weighed heavier and heavier upon her soul.
`As administrators of Dr. Elmore's
property
it becomes us to look up all that belongs
to him and the debts and rents due him. We
would, therefore, ask you, madam, at what
rent you have hired this house of the late
Dr. Elmore, and if you are in arrears for rent
and how much?'
Mrs. Hart became paler still. `Rent, sir!
Indeed, gentlemen, I shall not be able to
answer
this question to your satisfaction. Dr.
Elmore charitably placed me and my family
in this house, after my husband's decease,
and bade me regard it as my own. This is
but one of his numerous acts of benevolence
of which I or mine have been the grateful
objects.'
`Dr. Elmore while living could do as he
pleased with his property,' answered Mr.
Straitbrim, looking down upon her with a
majestic frown; `but we, who are
administrators
,
have only one course to pursue.
Men, if they would have their own minds and
intentions carried out, must look after the
disposition of their property before they die.
Dr. Elmore, you say, said this. But have
you papers to show it?'
`No, sir.'
`How long have you tenanted the
premises
?'
`Two years next Saturday!'
`During this time what rent have you
paid?' asked Mr. Straitpurse emphatically.
`None, sir.'
`None?' repeated Mr. Straitbrim.
`None!' echoed Mr. Straitpurse.
`Two years and no rent,' exclaimed Mr.
Straitbrim.
`No rent in two years!' repeated Mr.
Straitpurse.
Then both gentlemen exchanged glances;
shook their heads, and ahemmed very
positively
.
The two administrator's having thus
expressed their mutual astonishment, bent
their two pair of eyes upon the widow, who
felt as if she were a criminal arraigned before
two judges. Ellen all the while sat upon the
piano-stool pale and attentive to all that
passed
.
`We see by the late Dr. Elmore's papers,
madam,' said Mr. Straitbrim, `that this
tenement
rented the year previous to your
occupying
,
at one hundred and seventy-five
dollars
per annum; a very pretty sum these hard
times. This for two years, amounts tolet me
see? twice 5 is 10; twice 7 is 14 and 1 to
carry
is 15; twice 1 is 2 and one is 3. It
amounts to just $350 for the two years rent
up to next Saturday, madam.'
`Exactly,' said Straitpurse. `A very
pretty
sum indeed these times.'
`Money is worth, too 1 1-2 per month.
`I got 2 per cent for it yesterday.
`Ah, did you! Now, madam, there is
interest
to be calculated which will make it
some $370, at a rough guess! This amount
we regard you as indebted to the estate of the
late Dr. Elmore unless you can show legal
instrument
from his hand quitting rent for this
period of time.'
`We are sorry, madam,' said Mr.
Straitpurse
,
seeing the lifeless cheek and trembling
agitation of the widow, `we are very sorry to
give you any trouble! No doubt Dr.
Elmore's
intentions were very good, and as you
say; but we are administrators, and as such,
have no discretionary power. Dr. Elmore,
as we just said, living could do as he
pleased with his property, but dead,
administrators
must do as the law says. Very sorry,
madam, very!'
`Very indeed, but it is our duty to find you
in this debt, and we shall be under the
necessity
of securing it, madam.'
`Gentlemen,' cried the widow, clasping
her hands in despair, `have mercy upon me!
I have no means to liquidate so fearful a debt!
Alas! that good Dr. Elmore's intentions
towards
the widow and the fatherless should be
thus dreadfully thwarted.'
`Tears and hand-wringing, madam, are of
no use,' said Straitbrim. `Women always do
this in trifles! It is their natural weapons?
This debt is a just one. You cannot avoid
paying it.'
`But I have no means!'
`Means! humph!' ejaaulated Straitpurse,
glancing at the piano, which Ellen had
deserted
to sit by her mother and take her hand,
partly as if for protection, partly to console
her. `You certainly seem to be living in good
style here for a woman who lives in a charity
house! That piano is an enormous luxury!
It will pay half the debt, madam.'
`Not quite, I should think, Mr. Straitpurse,'
said Straitbrim, walking up to it and
examining
it; `it seems some worn, and pianos are
cheaper than they were. It might bring a
hundred at auction. I gave five hundred for
that one of my daughter's; but then that was
a very different affair!'
`Gentlemen, the piano is also a mark of Dr.
Elmore's bounty. He hired it from a music
store and sent it here for my daughter!'
`Humph!' ejaculated both administrators.
`Dr. Elmore was a weak man in some
things,' said Straitbrim to Straitpurse. Mr.
Straitpurse nodded, and then both gentlemen
exchanged glances.
`A very unnecessary luxury, madam, for a
poor woman! You ought to have come down
in your notions by this time,' said Mr.
Straitbrim
.
`Your daughter would be better
employed
knitting stockings or working in a
factory.'
`She understood music well, gentlemen,
when Mr. Hart died, and Dr. Elmore sent this
piano to her to enable her to give lessons. He
also obtained several scholars for her! With
these she has greatly contributed to the
support
of herself and brother and sister.'
`There is furniture here that looks nice!
This is not hired too!' asked Straitpurse
sneeringly
.
`It is mine, sir. The wreck of my poor
husband's property,' she answered, too much
overcome with the prospect of wretchedness
before her to notice his tone.
`How much property do you think you have
in the world, Mrs. Hart?' asked Straitbrim,
after looking round the room.
`Certainly, gentlemen, all I am worth would
not sell for $100.'
`There is a parlor, is there not?' he asked,
opening the door into a neatly furnished room.
`Yes, sir. It was already furnished by Dr.
Elmore when I came into the house.'
`Oh, ah! very well! Then it can remain
with the house,' answered Straitbrim
ironically
,
and smiling at Straitpurse, who smiled
also very sagaciously and said,
`Very well, madam. As the house and all
the furniture is Dr. Elmore's we shall of course
claim it, as administrators. We were not
aware of this property before. So, if you
please, we will lock up the parlour? This
afternoon I will send for the furniture, unless
' here he stopped and looked very grave,
`unless you conclude to retain the house after
paying up arrears; in which case we can rent
you the furniture. Very sorry, madam.
Tears are easy shed and easily dried? We
are men of business, and must act
accordingly
.'
`Gentlemen,' cried the widow, clasping
her hands while the tears rolled down her
cheeks, `what, oh what are you to do? What
great evil is this that Dr. Elmore's death is to
bring upon me and my children?'
`We are very sorry? Can't do otherwise,
madam,' said Straitbrim. `As I said before,
we must do our duty. Can you pay this
arrears
of rent?'
`No, sir! I have but two dollars and a
quarter in money in the world! I earn
scarcely
three dollars a week and Ellen has but
five scholars at four dollars a quarter, and
this money has to clothe and support us. It
is our all
, save the little furniture and bedding
we possess! Gentlemen, I and mine are in
your power! I throw myself wholly upon
your mercy and kindness. I plead not for
myself, but for this weeping girlfor my two
young children! You have acknowledged
that you were satisfied that it was Dr.
Elmore's
intention to give me a gratuity of the
rent! Why will you not then at least carry
out, as his administrators, this intention! I ask
not for extension of clemency beyond this
time from
you;
I only implore to have the
weight of the debt you have laid upon me
removed
!
I will leave the house! I will seek
a humbler abode! Only let me not be crush
ed by a debt my benefactor never designed or
anticipated would come upon the objects of
his charities! You represent him! Oh, let
not your acts turn into curses what he
ordained
as blessings upon me and mine!'
As she ended this appeal, overcome by her
fears for her children, she threw herself upon
her knees before them!
`Madam,' said Straitpurse, `no doubt your
case is a hard one! But we see no way in
which we can remedy it. The debt is just!
We give you, also, formal notice to vacate
the premises before Sunday morning. You
need not trouble yourself to remove any thing
but your immediate personal effects, as we
shall consider it our duty to attach the
furniture
!
Good day, madam!'
`Good morning, marm,' added Straitbrim;
`sorry it is so! We, doubtless, appear severe
but business is business! No blame can
attach
to us! Good morning, marm!'
Thus speaking these two administrator's
whom we have drawn from life, and whose
names we can scarcely forbear writing out in
full, left the house. They stopped a moment
outside to survey its front and take a look at
its general situation, and then walked
together
down town. The
cant
of these rich,
heartless
men, that they were `administrators,'
that `they were doing their duty,' that `
business
was business?' was the argument of mean,
avaricious, contemptible and heartless men!
Both well knew that they could help it; that
though there might no paper exist securing
to the widow the gratuity of the rent, yet that
it was evidently Dr. Elmore's intention it
should be so, or he would have collected it, or
placed another tenant in it. Still, although
the Probate Court might call upon them in
their official capacity to account for this
arrears
of rent, in the absence of any paper
exempting
the tenant from liability, yet, when
they well knew Dr. Elmore's intention and
that she was recipient of his bounty, it was
their duty to have truly represented the case
to the Court or have paid over the debt
themselves
;
for they were both very rich men and
what better investment could they have made
of $350, than in carrying out so noble a
charity
as that of Dr. Elmore? For`he who
lendeth
to the poor lendeth to the Lord, and it
shall be paid him again.' Certainly it could
not be concealed from them that Mrs. Hart
was very poor, and a fit object for their
charity
.
But why do we reason, where such men as
Mr. Straitpurse and Mr. Straitbrim are the
parties?
To give
was not in their vocabulary!
To make, to take, to grasp, to grind, to bind,
to hoard, to heap, and to keep
, were words
engraven
on the palms of their hands, and cut
like the letters of a seal deep into their souls!
CHAPTER XI.
We
are now bringing this story to that
crisis
of events towards which it has been
gradually
tending from the first moment Henry
Hart began to depart from the ways of
integrity
and uprightness.
It was the afternoon of the day on which
Mrs. Hart had received the visits of the
administrators
.
The widow and Ellen, having
yielded to the first shock of grief, were now
more composed; and were calmly, though
with tears in their eyes, talking over their
gloomly prospects. Ellen was trying to be
calm to compose her mother; the mother
endeavoring
to set an example of resignation to
the child. Tommy and Grace, after their
return
from school at noon, had been sent again
after their frugal dinner, their hearts free from
the weight that oppressed their mother and
sister, who refrained from informing them of
the sad change that had befallen them all.
`What
shall
we do, dear mother?' said
Ellen
after a few moments thoughtful silence,
previous to which, every possible resource was
called up and discussed without the prospect
of giving them relief. What indeed should
they do? Prejudice would be against the
forger's
widow, and they dared not appeal to any
who had known Mr. Hart. To whom then
could they apply? Their mode of life the last
two years had been very retired; and Mrs.
Hart had sought no intimacies. She knew
none but the humble neighbors about her.
`You ask a question, my sweet child, that
God alone can answer,' answered the widow.
`These administrators may think they are
doing right, but right is not righteousness.
We are indeed wretched, Ellen. But let us
not despair. We have a prospect of going to
the almshouse, for there is nothing left to us!
no house open to us!' She covered her face
and wept.
`God is in the alms-house, dear mother!'
said Ellen in a tone of gentle faith; stooping
and kissing her forehead as she sat.
`Bless you, my child! That word has
strengthened me!
He
is in the alms-house!
and let us not forget it. I am cheerful again!
Let us not fear, `for the widow and orphan
are mine,' saith the Lord.'
At that moment the door opened and
Tommy
and Grace came in from school. Grace was
weeping, and she had her gown torn, and her
face was flushed; and Tommy's cheek was
bleeding, and his hand blood-stained; while
his features wore a very determined look of
defiance.
`What is the matter? What new evil has
befallen me in my children?' cried the mother,
running first to Grace and then drawing
Tommy
to her. Are you hurt?'
`I have been fighting,' said Tommy.
`And I helping him, because the big boy
was whipping him,' answered Grace.
`Henry Talbot, because I got above him in
the class, got angry and after school told me
my father was hanged for forgery. I told him
he lied: and then he struck me and we fought,
and I whipped him: then another boy said I
was a gallows-bird, and I struck him; and as
he was twice as big as I am, he would have
whipped me, as he got me down, if Grace
had'nt helped me out by pulling me his
hair! Didn't I do right, dear mother? To
call my father a forger and say he was hung,'
cried the excited, manly little fellow, from
whom Mrs. Hart had carefully guarded from
them the secret which would cast disgrace
upon her offspring.
Mrs. Hart made no reply. She gazed from
one to the other and then sunk into her chair.
exclaiming with anguish unspeakable,
`Oh God, oh God! This is more than thy
servant can bear! Oh Ellen, that the dear
children had been spared this fearful
knowledge
!
My heart will break!'
`Mother, this is indeed bitterness! But all
is rightly ordered. I feel as certain a trust in
God as I do in younay stronger, for I know
he can do what you cannot do! If you knew
with what filial child-like confidence my heart
is constantly going up to Him, knowing He
will make all things work for our good, you
would be as calm as I am! Do you suppose
He does not see at this moment! you seated
weeping in your chair, I kneeling by your side,
Tommy and Grace standing there with the
signs of their recent contest fresh upon them,
and knows not all has caused our sorrow?
Does he not know from the beginning each
event, and does he not know we are innocent,
though, alas, my poor father may have been
guilty! And will he suffer the innocent to
perish? No! Be assured that out of this
seeming evil of our lot He is preparing a good
for us.'
`You are a comforter, indeed, dear Ellen!'
said Mrs. Hart, removing the blood for
Tommy's
cheek. `I will at least imitate your
faith and fortitude, if I cannot possess them.
Ah, there is another knock? I start as if I
were a guilty thing. Yet I am only poor.
`There is no guilt in poverty. The poor
who trust in God are rich; for `the gold and
the silver,' He says `are His. I will open
the door.'
`It is, I fear, the officers!'
`Are we not prepared for them, dear
mother
,
whenever they come! Let us not forget
God is with us and will stand at our right
hand though the officers stand before us.'
The visiter was a short man with a light
complexion, whity yellow hair, bushy
eye-brows
,
small, thin mouth, scanty
half-whiskers
,
pink edged eyes, and a pink cravat, and
a striped pink and green vest; enormous ears;
hair cropped short; black teeth and nails; and
a very fashionable buckish white hat, green
coat and drab pantaloons. He sported a huge
cameo breast-pin of Napoleon's head, and a
huge seal ring on his little finger, which he
kept ungloved to display.
As Ellen opened the door he bowed,
simpered
and said,
`Ah, Miss Ellen how do you do?' He
extended
his hand to take hers, but she drew
back and politely, but gravely said,
`How do you do, Mr. Creech?'
Be it here observed that Creech had been
so successful as to turn aside from himself
all suspicion in the public mind of being a
party
to the forgeries of his partner Henry Hart;
but Dr. Elmore had suspected him, and also
one or two others. But nothing was said to
lead to any investigations of his conduct. He,
however, informed Mrs. Hart that he suspected
Mr. Creech had been the prime mover in the
forgeries; and that if Mr. Hart had lived the
trial would have revealed this to have been the
fact. Creech, after the excitement had a
little
subsided, and the affairs of the Firm were
adjusted, put a few hundreds he had saved
from the general wreck into a retail dry-goods
store in Hanover street, and began soon to
make a noise with flashy, puffy advertisements
in the newspapers. `
Creech
's, No.
Hanover street
,' with `
Great Bargains
,
selling lower than First Cost,' &c., &c., met
the eye in all the Dailies. He kept his
buggy
and boarded at a stylish Hotel.
Occasionally
he had seen Mrs. Hart in the street, but
he had forgotten her quite! But he hadn't
forgotten Ellen! He had his intentions
turned
towards the young and blooming girl even
when he was the partner of her father, and
hoped one day by gaining her hand to get a
position into the society to which, neither by
birth, education, nor manners, he well knew
he had no pretensions. Often since her
father's
fall he had passed her in the street and
bowed; but she never recognized him; for
she had been told by her mother that her
father
would not have been so erring a man if it
had not been for Mr. Creech. The young
and innocent heart of the child therefore
instinctively
revolted at the sight of the man.
A few weeks before Dr. Elmore's death
Creech met her, by accident, walking with
him, and a certain design he had formed of
calling on Mrs. Hart to cultivate the
acquaintance
of the beautiful Ellen: was promptly
given up by him; for Creech had a great
dislike
to any thing like an encounter, or chance
of an encounter, with Dr. Elmore, and he
was not ignorant that the family of his partner
was under his benevolent protection. We
shall let Mr. Creech now explain for himself
the reason of his present appearance.
`Is your mother at home, Miss Ellen?' he
asked, smiling as if to conceal his chagrin at
the coldness of his reception; and gazing
upon
her with impertinent admiration.
`She is, sir.'
`I will step in and see her, if you please.'
Ellen returned hastily to her mother and
mentioned Mr. Creech's name. She had
hardly done so before the Junior Partner
followed
her into the room. Mrs. Hart received
him as civilly as was in her power, yet with a
sinking of the spirit, for his presence seemed
to be the forerunner of some new evil.
`Sorry to hear the news, Mrs. Hart! Called
down to see what I could do in the premises,'
said the junior partner, taking a chair for him
self, while Ellen and Mrs. Hart stood. `I met
Mr. Straitpurse, and he told me how my late
partner's widow was circumstanced, said he
was very sorry, but it was all in the way of
business. And men `in the way of business,'
Mrs. Hart, you know have no knowledge of
friends! Straitpurse seemed very sorry, but
couldn't be helped. I am sorry too, I assure
you, marm! I came down soon as I could, to
see what I could do for you!'
`Thank you, Mr. Creech, you are very
kind,' said the widow gratefully! for Creech
really spoke and seemed very kind and
friendly
;
and she needed friendly words, poor
woman
.
They opened her heart at once.
`Not at all! I don't forget the widow and
orphans of my old partner, if he did commit a
slip of the pen! Accidents will happen to
the best of men, Mrs. Hart; and the Junior
Partner looked and seemed as if he thought in
the course of human affairs such an accident
might
happen to him. `I called to see if you
are really so bad off as Straitpurse said?' and
he looked round the room, and then at them,
inquiringly.
`Yes, Mr. Creech. I don't know that I
have any thing. This house and furniture
are the bounty of Dr. Elmore. What few
articles
I could otherwise call my own, I am
forbid to remove, as they are to be taken for
rent!'
Very,
very
sad affair,' said the Junior
Partner
shaking slowly his head, and glancing
wistfully under his shaggy eyebrows at the
beautiful Ellen. `I would be happy to serve
you, if I could marm! But I am not very
rich! I am, however, doing a little in the
money making way! You've doubtless heard
of Creech's store, No.  Hanover street! I
can't say I'm rich; but then a friend's widow
shall not suffer.'
Mrs. Hart remembered her children, and
her utter destitution, and forgot all her
prejudices
against Creech. Besides, he seemed to
feel so much.
`You are very good, Mr. Creech.
`Don't thank me, marm! I like to do
good without letting myself know it, if I
could do so! I can't bear thanks! So you
have no home?' he said with a sort of secret
exultation.
`No, sir; indeed, I have no home after we
leave this.'
`Nor no friends?'
`None but tho friend of the widow and the
fatherless!' she said with a glance of holy
faith upward.
`Humph!' ejaculated Creech; for he had
little christian faith himself; and would not
have lent the Lord a dollar by giving it to a
poor man. `This is bad,
very
bad, marm!
And you have no money?'
`But a couple of dollars, and seven due
Ellen by her scholars!'
`
Very
bad, indeed.'
Mr. Creech then looked down and was
very thoughtful; while mother and daughter
watched his features with anxiety, yet with
a want of perfect confidence in the man.
But to whom else should they look. What
other means of relief had they? And God
they knew worked by means. Might not
Mr. Creech be his instrument? Patiently
and nervously they waited the issue of his
meditations. At length he looked up and
smiling upon Ellen said,
`It mustn't be, Miss Ellen, that so lovely
a girl as you are should be turned into the
street! I always had a regard for you, when
you was a child! I will now prove it to you
and your mother! I have a small
comfortable
tenement which I had furnished for
myself
a few weeks ago to keep bachelor's hall
infor you know I am not a married man
yet, Mrs. Hart. This has three rooms, one
furnished as a parlor, one as a bed-room, and
the other as a kitchen. Now I am willing to
go back to the hotel and board, and give my
rooms up to you Mrs. Hart until you can do
better. It is only two squares from here and
you can move what you want from here over
there at any time. I will send a hand-cart
for your things. Now, don't thank me, it
confuses me.'
Here the Junior Partner looked modestly
down. Mrs Hart looked at Ellen with her
eyes full of grateful tears, and then said,
`Not to thank you would be more than I
could consent to, Mr. Creech! Your
kindness
penetrates my heart! You have, indeed,
proved yourself a friend at a time when most
needed!'
`I should have called on you long since,
Mrs. Hart, with offers of service, but I knew
you had Dr. Elmore your friend.'
`Alas, he was indeed a friend.'
`I hope I shall prove to be one also,' said
the Junior Partner, diffidently, and at the
same time looking tenderly towards Ellen,
who by no means regarded him with favor.
`I have no doubt you will, sir!'
`Then I may consider my offer as accepted?'
`Ireallyindeed, Mr. Creech, I am at a
loss how to reply! It is so great a favor
and I am so utterly beyond any way of
making
you a return!'
`Don't speak of such a thing, Mrs. Hart,'
said Creech disinterestedly. `It would make
me so happy to be of service to you.'
`Then I must for a while burden you, I
fear; for I have no other resource when I
leave here. To-morrow is Saturday, and the
last day on which I can remain here.'
`I will then send to-morrow for your things.
If you are so reluctant to be under an
obligation
,
I will charge you a trifling rent, which
Ellen can pay with her needle, and that will
make you feel independent.'
`You are very goodtoo kind, Mr. Creech.'
`So every body tells me, marm. But I
can't help it! Good evening Mrs. Hart.
Good evening Miss Ellen! Ah, my little
Grace and Tommy, you and I will yet be great
friends!'
The Junior Partner then tapped Tommy on
the head, kissed Grace, and smiling with a
tender glance and gallant bow towards Ellen,
he left the house. Mrs. Hart turned with
looks far brighter and mere cheerful than they
had been for some hours, to Ellen and said,
`I see, dear, we should never despair. Mr.
Creech is indeed a friend raised up by God!
You did not seem grateful enough, Ellen?'
`I don't know, dear mother, but I can't get
over my dislike to Mr. Creech.'
`He can't be so bad as he has been
represented
,
I think. What friend could have
come more promptly, or offered more aid?
He even gives up his own rooms.'
`Yes, mama!'
`And charges us but a triflle of rent, in
delicacy
to my feelings.'
`Yes, mama!'
`And will let us remain there till we can do
better.'
`Yes, mama.'
`Why, my dear child, what has possessed
you! You look really more sad than before
this sunshine.'
Ellen said nothing in reply. She seemed
instinctively to see a dark cloud ready to blot
out the sun-light, and pour upon their
devoted
heads a storm.
We shall briefly add in closing this chapter
that the next day an officer took possession of
Mrs. Hart's dwelling, and that Mr. Creech
sent a hand-cart and a back for her to remove
to his rooms. They found them cheerful and
genteel; and Mrs Hart was gratified to find
that in addition to the bed he had
considerately
added a trundle for the children. There
was bread, and butter, and flour, and tea, and
sugar, in the pantry: and potatoes and meat
in the larder; wood in the closet, and
crockery
and cooking utensils, and everything
needful, and that could contribute to their
comfort. Their hearts were full of gratitude,
and even Ellen's prejudices were removed.
In the evening Mr Creech came in to see how
they were fixed and to take tea with them;
and the board was a very social and happy
one. Mrs Hart was now more than ever
dependent
;
for she had
no
property not even
in a chair or table. The hard-hearted
administrators
,
Messrs. Straitbrim and Straitpurse,
had distrained on all her worldly goods! She
was now wholly dependent for house and
furniture
,
and home, on Mr. Creech. Poor Mrs
Hart! better would it have been for thee and
thine to trust to the street `where God is!'
than to the deceitful friendship of an
unprincipled
man. The succeeding, which will be
also the last chapter, will unfold the nature of
Mr. Creech's philanthropy.
CHAPTER XII.
We now carry our readers forward to a
period
three months later than the time at which
the last chapter closed. During this interval
the forger's widow had been an occupant of
the rooms of the Junior Partner. At first, Mr.
Creech would only call three or four times a
week to tea, or pass the evening. At such
times he used all his art to ingratiate himself
into the good opinion of Mrs. Hart, and the
good graces of Ellen. To Mrs Hart he made
the present of a new dress; to Tommy of a
new hat, and Grace a frock. Ellen firmly
refused
a gift of a beautiful pink hat he
purchased
for her in Tremont street. She could
not overcome her suspicions of her father's
partner. She felt grateful to him, but at the
same time a feeling of repugnance. He saw
he had made but slow progress in her favor;
and that while Mrs. Hart had in him every
confidence, and regarded him as her best
friend, she was cold and avoided his society.
Indeed he had never been able to be alone
with her. On some pretence or other she
would instantly rise and follow her mother, if
she were called out of the room. Mr Creech
became very much vexed and displeased; and
at length resolved he would make plainer
demonstrations
.
They had been three months, a quarter, in
his tenement, during which time they had
really been the dependents upon his bounty.
Ellen felt this keenly, and worked at her
needle night and day to earn money to
enable
them, at least, to eat one meal which was
not composed of articles given by Mr Creech.
Mrs Hart also worked early and late to be able
to pay up the rent he should charge.
One evening, three or four days after the
end of the first quarter, Mr Creech dropped
in upon his dependents. Mrs. Hart received
him with gratitude, yet with that feeling of
restraint which dependents can never
overcome
.
Ellen rose, bowed politely, but
without
meeting his eyes, and handed him a chair.
He looked for a moment round the room with
a sort of embarrassed air, turned his hat up
and looked at the marker's name with an
absent
manner, hummed a note or two and then
said
`Mrs Hart, will you be so kind as to get
me a glass of water.'
`Certainly, Mr Creech,' she answered,
rising
.
`No, I will go, mother!' said Ellen
springing
up.'
`No, Miss Ellen, let your mother go. I
would
rather
your mother would go for it!'
Mr Creech laid a sort of emphasis on the word
rather. Mrs Hart nodded her head with slight
reproval to Ellen, and left the room. Ellen
looked as if she was about to follow her.
`Excuse me, Mr Creech; my mother will
have to draw the water; and she is not strong
lately. I will help her!'
`Stay, Miss Ellen,' said Creech, taking her
hand. `I want an opportunity to say a word
to you. I have tried to see you alone, but you
seem to shun me. I wish to tell you that I
adore you and that if you wish you can make
me happy! I am well off! I can give you
every thing that you want! I will help your
mother, and brother, and sister! I will do
everything to make you and yours
comfortable
,
if you will consent to make me happy!'
Ellen was thunder struck. She trembled.
Her face grew pale as the marble! She
struggled to release her hand.
`I do not understand you, Mr Creech!' she
said with an effort.
`You cannot wish me to be plainer, Miss
Ellen,' he said looking upon her with a
significant
air. `You are pooryour mother is
poor and a dependant on my charity! You
are disgraced by your father's act, and altho'
you are beautiful you can never expect to get
a husband! You had better, therefore,
consent
to embrace the offer I am making you
and'
By this time the insulted maiden seemed to
comprehend his unprincipled proposition!'
'Till now she regarded him as seeking her
hand in marriage. She started back from him
as the infamous truth flashed upon her pure
mind; and with a flashing eye and a
heightened
cheek she cried with indignant spirit
`Monster! Do you dare to insult me thus?
I see that I have not feared you without true
instinct! Dare to speak to me again in this
manner, sir, and ' here she stopped, for
she felt her impotency.
`And
what
will you do? he asked with a
sneer.
`I will, as it is, sir, this very hour fly with
my mother from your guilty roof! Is it for
this that you have extended to wards us your
benevolence?'
`It
is
for this, Miss, answered Creech with
malignant triumph. `From the first,
enamored
of your charms, I resolved you should
be mine. I knew you would in your
destitution
fall to some one, and I resolved to be the
possessor of so rich a prize! You need not be
so proud and indignant! You must come to
this at last, Miss Ellen! And you can find
no one who will be so true a friend to you and
yours as I will be!'
Ellen stood silentinsultedgrievedand
overwhelmed with shame, confusion, and
resentment
!
Tears at length gushed in torrents
from her eyes, and covering her face she wept
freely and bitterly. Had she lived to be the
object of a proposition so vile! Had poverty
then become a curse to them. Had God de
serted them. Was their destiny in the hands
of a monster. Alas, she felt that she had no
more faithno more hope. She was in
despair
.
That hour she resolved to quit the roof
which had only sheltered her and her mother
as the price of her honor. `Oh God! to what
shame and confusion am I brought!' she cried
in her swelling heart.
Creech approached her; for she had placed
the breadth of the room between them! She
would have fled from it, but he stood by the
door.
`What answer am I to have, pretty one!'
`Sir, am I to be insulted thus! Let me
leave the room!'
`Not till I have an answer, Ellen!'
`Oh, that we had gone into the street,
rather
than trusted you, false and unprincipled
man, using the sacred veil of charity to cover
the most infamous intentions!'
`Nay you go not by me!' he said, arresting
her as she would have passed him. `Come,
you had better consent! This house shall then
be yours, and as much money and as many
fine dresses as you want. I will'
`Insult me no further, sir!'
`You look more beautiful than ever!'
And he approached her and would have
thrown his arm about her if she had not
retreated
.
He followed her. Her eyes fell on
his cane which stood by the table, and she
caught it up. In the quick act it flew apart,
leaving a long slender sword in her grasp.
Her eye lighted up with confidence and
triumph
!
`Approach me a step further, sir, and it shall
be at your peril! Though I am but a yonng
girl I can use this weapon, Heaven has given
me, in my defence!
At this moment Mrs. Hart returned. She
was overcome with astonishment and alarm at
seeing Ellen's attitude.
`Mother, I have been insulted! This
villain
has dared to make to me, in your absence,
a proposition which to think of kindles my
cheek with shame! He has acknowledged
that his charities were extended to you with
the view of having them remunerated in your
daughter's person!'
Mrs Hart stood petrified. The feelings of
the mother and the spirit of the woman came
to her assistance! She wanted no words from
Creech to corroborate this scarcely credible
statement. The attitude of both were enough.
His was bold and impudent, as if he resolved
to brass it out.
`Sir, leave my house!' said Mrs. Hart
trembling with indignation.
`Madam, I am in my own house!'
answered
Creech very positively.
`Ellen, come my child! she cried in a
heartbroken
voice. Ellen dropped the
swordcane
from her hand and cast herself, weeping
passionately, into her mother's arms. `Let us
go? God is in the street!' said Mrs Hart
choking
with her feelings.
`Madam, you are in my power! You go
not from hence till you pay me my rent!' cried
Creech furious with disappointment; for he
had not anticipated defeat. He had reckoned
on an easy conquest; because his victim was
utterly destitute and dependant. His was
one of those mean spirits that regard poverty
and degradation as synonymous! God help
us! if the rich are the only upright ones on
earth'
Mrs. Hart as she spoke became as pale as
death! She saw that she and hers were
indeed
in his power! Her eyes became dim,
her brain reeled and she gasped for air.
`Ellen, support me! I am broken now
broken in pieces! Ellen I am falling! I am
blind! Oh, God! is this death I feel! If it
is, have mercy on my little ones! Mercy on
my lambs, Heavenly Father!'
`Mother! mother! oh, my mother!'
shrieked
Ellen as the Forger's widow sank
insensible
upon the floor at her feet. `Mother, speak!
It is Ellen! Oh, speak,oh hear the voice
of your childof your Ellen!'
But in vain the voice and touching cries of
the distracted maiden! Her mother lay still
and colorless as the marble.
`Monster! demon! you have slain my
mother
!'
she cried, rising and looking round.
But the Junior Partner fearful and conscience
stricken, had fled.
Let us draw a veil over this painful scene.
That night the spirit of the Forger's widow
was released from its frail tenement, and, we
trust, borne on angel's wings to a happier
world, `where the wicked cease from troubling
and the weary are at rest.' Creech came not
near the house. The body was buried at the
expense of the city, and some charitable
person
passing by and seeing Ellen and the two
children about to follow on foot the lonely
hearse, called a carriage for them. After the
funeral the carriage returned with them to
their dwelling, and then drove away. Ellen
placed her hand on the knob to open it with
the intention of getting her brother's and
sister's
things, and then quitting it forever. She
found it locked! On looking up she saw a
placard affixed with these words:
`To
Let
`Apply at
Creech's
, No. Hanover street.'
Ellen's heart sunk within her. Nothing
could so forcibly have impressed her with the
feeling that she had now no home, as this
brief notice of the placard.
`Come, children, let us go!' she said in a
faint voice.
`Where, sister?' asked Grace, who it will
be remembered was a lovely little girl of nine,
Tommy being an intelligent boy of eleven.
`
Where
!' came like an echo from the very
depths of her heart.
`Sister, we are very wretched now,' said
Tommy, his eyes red with weeping for his
mother. `Why don,t good Mr. Creech come
and see us! He has not been here since the
night mother died?'
Creech, however, was watching them at
that very moment from the closed curtains of
a hack which was stopped a little ways up
the street! He had not yet given up all hopes
of Ellen's submission! He had expended too
much money to resign her lightly; and
especially
now that she was an orphan. He smiled
within his black heart as he thought she would
yet be in his power.
Modestly attired in a calico, wearing a plain
straw bonnet and green veil, and taking a
hand of each, Ellen walked slowly up the
street. She felt lonely and deserted, yet she
did not lose confidence in an overruling
Providence
.
As she turned away from the locked
door she said fervently`Heavenly Father,
thou hast promised to be with all thy children
in their in-goings and out-goings; and never
to leave nor forsake them! This promise I now
put my firm trust in; for my hope and
confidence
are in thee! My foot-steps now
wander forth without aim; but I know that
Thou art before me though I see thee not.'
What strength comes to the soul from
prayer
!
It is the nourishment of confidence! `A
word
to
God is a word
from
God! This
Ellen
at once felt forcibly She was calm and
cheerfully, save that grief for her mother's
loss was heavy at her heart. But she had no
fears for herself or the two who trusted in her.
She took the way down the street. It was
nearly dark, and she wished to find shelter for
them before night. Care for them caused her
to forget herself. They walked down that
street and then up another. It was a street of
handsome dwellingsthe abodes of the rich,
and she turned from it to a humbler one!
She knew charity was most active among the
poor, who have known suffering. It grew dark
rapidly. The lamplighter hurried past them
with his blazing torch, rapidly kindling the
lanterns
one after another Poor Ellen's heart
sunk within her, yet she lifted her soul in faith
to the invisible Guardian and Protector of all.
A poor black woman stood by a gate near a
wretched tenement She looked earnestly at
the three.
`Lor bress us all! if I don't think dat be
yung Tommy Hart!'
Tommy looked round and so did Ellen and
they recognized an old black woman who used
to be cook at their father's. Ellen shook hands
with her, and her heart swelled that even this
poor woman knew them and spoke kindly.'
`I declar, dis is a circumstans,' said the
woman
;
`I so glad to see you! How you be
growd Miss Grace; and you is quite a lady
Miss Ellen. I hear your marm died. I am
sorry for you, dear ones! Whar you lib? I
hant heer nothin' `bout you dis long time, sins
Dr. Elmore dead.'
`I am sorry I cannot tell you good, Jane,'
said Ellen sadly. `My mother owed rent, and
we have been denied admission into the house
since the funeral.'
`And whar yon goin' now?' asked the kind
old black woman in a tone of sympathy,
putting
her apron to her eyes.
`I really cannot tell you, Jane! I am going
where God opens a door for us!'
`Then God hab open dat door for you and
it stan' open,' said the Cook, pointing to the
open door of her one story cabin.
`Come, you must come in! I got two beds,
and you, and Tommy, and Grace shall hab one,
and I and Nancy 'll hab de oder. I got
someting
to make you nice supper, and now come
in, and don't break poor Jane's heart by
saying
no!'
Ellen could not reply. Emotion suffocated
her! Tears filled her eyes. She canght Jane's
hand, pressed it gratefully and followed her
into the low tenement. Though a wretchedly
poor place, it wore an air of neatness and
comfort. A cheerful fire was causing a tea
kettle smartly to sizzle over the coals, and a
white counterpane to one bed and a neatly
patched quilt to the other (for both beds were
in the same room! and there was but one room
to Jane's abode), gave it a homelike air.
For three weeks the orphans made their
home with the kind Jane. Ellen assisted her
to cook and wash and iron, for such was now
her means of living, though Jane would not
at first consent to it. Ellen was far from
entertaining
any feelings of superiority, but
cheerful and resigned, she with a beautiful
humility
becoming her condition, contributed
her labor to the common maintenance.
The fourth day a ter her abode there she
had received a note from Creech. Knowing
the hand, she erased her own name upon the
superscription and returned it unopened.
Tommy tried to get work by crying the daily
papers; but as he was evidently superior to
the boys, they conspired against him and drove
him from every stand he occupied. He
remained
at home, carrying water and going
after and returning with clothes for Jane. At
the end of the third week Jane fell sick, with
the rheumatism, and fever set in so that she
had to take to her bed!
Ellen did all her washing for her, ironed
and sent home the clothes, and there were
several dozen of them: and at the same time
cooked and took all the care of poor Jane;
rubbing her limbs and nursing her with
angelic
devotion and tenderness. But Jane's
fever increased, and after a week's suffering
the good woman died, and went to the
reward
awaiting those who have done deeds
of charity and mercy, whatever be the hue of
their skin.
The story of Ellen and the two orphans was
known to nearly all the neighborhood, which
was one of Africans, the friends and
acquaintances
of Jane. After the funeral some of
these persons stopped to see her, and to
condole
with her. Ellen's grief was sincere;
and she wept the loss of her friend with tears.
What was she now to do! The neighbors
had their own subsistence to look after, their
own cares and poverty. In a day or two she
was left to herself. She sent Tommy after
the washing as when Jane lived, and tried
to support herself and children; but Nance
the daughter of Jane, who inherited her
mother's
little effects, got a place out to work
and removed the furniture, even to the last
washing tub; for Nancy had no feeling; and
told Ellen that `white folks should support
white folks; niggers had as much as they
could do to get a livin' for demself.'
A cart came and carried off
everything
,
even to the beds. Ellen and Tommy and
Grace slept in each others arms that night
huddled together in a corner of the desolate
and unfurnished cabin In the morning she
gave them each the last piece of bread, and
then began to reflect upon what she should
do. Suddenly a shadow darkened the door.
It was the Junior Partner. He had never
suffered his intended victim to escape his
espionage! Nancy had been bribed by him
to act as she did! He now came like the
Tempter. It was an hour of darkness, of the
trial of Ellen's faith, almost of despair! But
Ellen's soul was buoyed up by faith which
no reverses could shake. The same sun
shone, the flowers bloomed; the birds sang!
God then still lived and was present. He
could see and know all! He would aid her
if it were for her good. Why then should
she despair?
`Miss Ellen, good morning! I am sorry to
see you reduced to this,' he said looking round
upon the bare walls and upon the earthen floor.
`But you may thank your own stubborness! I
offered you once, comfort and luxury. I have
now come to repeat the offer! I will do all for
you you can ask, for you and your brother and
sister! You will have to come to it at last!
Say that you consent and you shall at once
change this wretched hovel for rooms more
sumptuous than those you formerly occupied!'
Ellen could only articulate `Begone, sir!
Death is preferable to thy hatred presence!'
She looked deadly pale! Her very spirit felt
the wound this man's proposal inflicted upon
her maiden delicacy. She shed tears. They
fell upon her brother's cheek.
`Sir,' said Tommy, `you are making my
sister weep! She says you are a bad man! I
don't know what you are saying to her, but
her looks tells me she is both offended and
ashamed! I am aot a man, but you shall not
speak to her in this manner! You called her
stubborn! I do not like you, Mr. Creech! You
made my father do wickedly, and that brought
this misery upon us, his children. Go from
here, sir! Leave this house, sir!'
Creech was astonished. He drew back, for
base minds are always cowardly! Vice cannot
stand before virtue even in it weakest form!
Tommy's attitude was fearless and menacing.
`So this whelp can bark it seems,' he said
angrily. `Get out of the way, boy!' And he
rudely pushed him. Tommy clenched his
fist and flying in his face struck him a severe
blow, so that he staggered back. The next
moment he raised his cane and would have
felled the spirited boy if his own hand had not
been caught and himself hurled with
violence
to the opposite side of the hovel. He
recovered himself with a deep execration and
drawing the sword from his cane turned and
saw a tall, elegant young man with his eyes
flashing fire.
`So, villian! Have you not enough,' cried
the youth, at the same moment he seized
the ruffian's wrist and wrested the sword
from his hand, saying:
`Now sir, begone! Leave this city! For I
swear to you I will serve you precisely in this
manner whenever and wherever I fall in with
you in the streets! I will willingly pay one
hundred dollars for each satisfaction. So, if
you value your life leave the city forthwith!
But stay! I have not yet done with you!
Come here! Come hither, I say! There! Now
down upon your knees and ask the pardon of
this noble young person for the insulting words
I have heard you utter as I stood on the
outside
,
where I waited only that you might fill
up the cup of your audacity!
Down
, I say!
Both knees! Now ask humbly her pardon!
Speak! Louder! Very well! Now get thee
gone! Remember what I have told thee! if I
catch you again in the streets of this city
where your hated figure will offend the eyes
of this young lady, I will cowhide you, and I
shall carry one with me for the especial
purpose
.
Get thee gone! If you would like to
know who I am, my name is Edward Elmore,
son of Dr. Elmore, and the avenger of the
innocent
,
whom he loved and protected!'
Creech, astonished, confounded, beaten,
humbled, and full of rage, terror and physical
pain, crawled from the hut and made his
miserable way to the street.
In the meanwhile Ellen had stood as if an
angel had descended into the hut and
avenged
her! Tommy and Grace danced, cried and
laughed in the same breath at Creech's
chastisement
and humiliation. Ellen did not at
first recognise in the tall, handsome young
man, his heightened color, frowning brow and
flashing eye, her old acquaintance, Edward
Elmore. But gradually the resemblance
broke upon her, and she almost fainted for
joy! He had no need to mention his name to
her!
As the crest-fallen Creech disappeared he
turned to her, and with a tone and look of
tenderness
and delicate sympathy said,
`Pardon my rude entrance and conduct,
Miss Ellen, but I could not but the first thing
pay this fellow his deserts. You have not
forgotten me, I hope!'
Ellen covered her face with her hands and
wept she knew not why! She could hot have
spoken a word if her life had depended on it.
Her heart was too full, all too full of
happiness
and hope? He took one of her hands and
removed it, and said touchingly,
`Ellen, I know all your sad story! I have
come here to take you awayyou and those
you love! I arrived three days ago from Paris,
and my first inquiries were for youthe
friend of my youthwhose image has been
like an angel form going before me ever since
I left you! I was told your mother had died,
but no one knew your fate! Ah, how
wretched
you must have been! I sought youI
followed
you up step by step, day and night,
from the hour you left my father's tenement
till I found you here in this miserable abode!
Now come with me, dear Ellen! My carriage
is at the gate! Haste to quit this horrible spot!
We will talk further by and by.'
Ellen spoke not; But he saw gratitude and
happiness in her tearful eyes! In a few
moments
afterwards they were driving rapidly
towards the mansion of a married friend of
Edward Elmore's in Mount Vernon street,
where Ellen found from the beautiful wife of
his friend a sister's welcome.
We now bring our tale to a close. Edward
who had cherished abroad the warmest
attachment
for Ellen, which was unknown to
him reciprocal in her own breast, had often in
his letters to his father spoken of his
attachment
and his determination to seek her for his
wife. This knowledge of his son's
predelections
,
led Dr. Elmore, aside from his native
benevolence of character, to take the interest
he had done in the family; and frequent
earnest
letters received from Edward after he had
learned of her father's fate, led him to have an
especial regard for their happiness. On
hearing
of his father's death, Edward hastened to
the United States as soon as possible. His only
thought was Ellen. He found Messrs
Straitpurse
and Straitbrim,and having learned from
them their course of proceedings he
warmly
and indignantly expressed his surprise and
displeasure, told them plainly what he thought
of them, and began his search. It was a long
one. By mere accident he heard of them at
Creech's rooms, and of their having been
ejected. He sought Creech but was unable
to fall in with him, but learned enough of his
character from his neighbors as to lead him to
draw very conclusive evidences of the base
motives he had in view in giving protection
to Mrs. Hart and Ellen, and then of rejecting
them in the manner he did. From Creech's
he could obtain no clue to them. He went
from neighborhood to neighborhood inquiring
at the corner groceries, bakeries and other
places for a family of such persons as he sought.
By mere accident he inquired (after twice
passing it by) at a negro's groggery on the
corner of the lane on which Jane's house
house stood! Nancy was in the shop, and
instantly
answered that she knew; and when
he said he would give fifty dollars to find
those he sought, she instantly offered to
conduct
him. On the way he asked so many
questions that she saw he was deeply in
terested
in them and that they had at last a friend.
She then glibly told him all, how Ellen had
first come there, and took all the credit of
Jane's hospitaiity to herself. He thanked her
with great warmth, and promised to reward
her, if they should prove to be those he was
seeking. Seeing now that he was likely to
be a better friend than Creech and fearing to
implicated with him, she began to excuse
herself
for taking away the furniture, saying she
owed Creech and he seized it; and `that he
wanted to get the young Ellen into his power,
who said she had fled before from his
persecutions
.'
In this manner conversing, Edward
reached
the yard and passed on before Nancy, as he
wished to observe their true condition. He
thus overheard the scene we have described.
Thus had a Providence shown itself in the
final
event, at the very darkest hour! And thus
Providence sees often to wait, that we may
first do all we can, and that faith may be
tried.
The sudden change from utter destitution
to comfort, luxury, friends and affection, was
too great for Ellen immediately to realise!
The presence of the happy Edward, however,
assured her of her happiness; and in the
society
of one who had long had her heart and
whom in all her deepest afflictions she had
never ceased tenderly to remember, joy
returned
to her heart, the smile to her lip, and
the bloom to her cheek. Tommy and Grace
were also made as happy as they could be;
and the three orphans having known the
privations
of misery, knew how to partake of the
blessings which were now strewn around their
sunny path.
In a few weeks the following notice
appeared
in the Boston papers:
`Married, yesterday morning, at Trinity
Church, Summer street, by the R't Rev.
Bishop
Griswold, Edward Elmore. MD., son of
the late Dr. Elmore, to Miss Ellen Hart. We
learn that young Dr. Elmore inherits one of
the largest fortunes of any young man in New
England. Bright be the future career of the
noble bridegroom and lovely bride!'
We have nothing further to add; save to
inform
the reader that the sign of `
Creech
,
No  Hanover street,' came down the day
after his interview with Edward Elmore, and
that Creech disappeared to parts unknown.
As to Mr. Straitbrim and Mr. Straitpurse, we
leave them to be settled for at the Judgment
Day. No judgment we could bring them to
could in any way measure their iniquities;
such men prosper in this worldfattening
for damnation! Thus we end our tale,
leaving
the kind reader to make his own moral
reflections
thereupon.
