LETTER I.
MERIEL HOWARD to CELIA SHELBURNE.
Woodbine Cot
,
April
20
th
, 1775.
Will
you believe me, Celia, when I
tell you, I
wish
I was at Bologne
again; that I am
dissatisfied
and unhappy.
You are
surprised
. It is
nevertheless
certainly
true. We formed erroneous opinions of
the world; we thought it a
paradise
compared
to the
solemnity
and gloom of our
convent
.
Trust
me, my dear, I have as yet found
nothing, in this gay,
busy
world, half
so
pleasing
, as that
sweet
retirement. But I
forget that this is my
first
letter, and that
you naturally
wish
to know every incident
which has happened
since
our
separation
.
This innocent
curiosity
shall
be gratified, and
to begin:
During our journey, Mr. Verdome
informed
me that the
reason
of my being
sent
for
home
so
suddenly
, was to attend Mrs.
Mirvan
,
my godmother, who had been for a
long time ill, and was
supposed
to be in a
deep decline. She went to
Bristol
,
continued
he, a few days before I left England;
your mother accompanied her, your father
and Mrs. Talbot were to follow the
ensuing
week; we
shall
, therefore, on our arrival in
England,
set
forward immediately for that
place.
Who is Mrs. Talbot?
said
I.
She is, replied Mr. Verdome, a
widow
lady, who, being left in rather indigent
circumstances
, and being a
distant
relation
of the family, has accepted an
asylum
in
your father's
house
.
If
she
is an amiable woman,
said
I, my
mother
must
be happy in having
such
a
companion
.
She is
sensible
, well bred, and good
antured
,
he repliedand here the
conversation
dropped.
I was, as you may
easily
imagine, too
much taken up with the
disagreeable
sensation
of
sea
-
sickness
, to be able to reflect much,
while
crossing
the channel: but no
sooner
was I in the
chaise
, proceeding toward
Bristol
,
than I began to form a
thousand
different
ideas about meeting my parents, not
having
seen
either of them
since
I could
remember
.
I pictured them to
myself
, as very
amiable old peopleand, in fancy, felt their
embraces and
kissed
off the tears of joy I
saw
falling from their eyes. Celia, we children
of
simplicity
form
strange
enthusiastic
notions
.
In thinking of my dear Mrs.
Mirvan
,
I felt more lively
sensations
;
because
I
was certain if
she
lived, when I arrived, I
should
be received by her with heart-felt
satisfaction
,
and
should
I find her no more, my
own heart would experience the
most
acute
anguish
. You
must
remember how much I
am indebted to her
tenderness
and affection,
and how very happy I was whenever
she
visited
our convent.
At length we arrived at the end of our
journey. I trembled
so
, that I could
scarcely
support
myself
. Expectation, hope, fear,
by turns were predominant in my
bosom
.
When we
stopped
, a
handsome
man, in
appearance
about five and thirty or forty years
of age, handed me from the
chaise
, and
saluting
me,
said
to Mr. Verdome, faith
she
is a very fine girl. I
saw
Mr. Verdome
srown
; but had not time to make any
further
remarks, before I found
myself
in the
chamber of my godmother. Oh Celia! how
that dear woman was altered; her face pale,
eyes
sunk
and
so
reduced that
she
could not
rise
to meet me. She faintly
smiled
when I
entered the room, I could not
speak
. I
saw
nothing, thought of nothing, but her; and
running to her threw my arms round her
neck and
burst
into tears. Dear creature,
said
Mrs. Mirvan (embracing me) we have
surprised
her. She was not prepared to
see
me thus, but come, my love, dry your tears;
here is another lady, who indeed
should
have
been the
first
object of your attention. I
turned round and beheld the
most
beautiful
woman, you can conceive, bending over me,
her eyes full of tears. My child, my
beloved
Meriel,
said
she
, taking me in her arms;
have you no recollection of your mother?
Whilst
I was folded in her maternal embrace
the door opened, and my mother continued,
come Mr. Howard welcome your
daughter
.
I
raised
my head from my dear
mother's
bosom
, and was
surprised
to
see
the
B 2
same
gentleman, who had handed me from
the
chaise
. Your father, Meriel,
said
my
mother. I bent one knee to the ground
and
kissed
his hand. But
shall
I
confess
that
whilst
in that action, which
should
have
expressed
filial
respect
and love, I felt more of
terror than either.
Rise
girl,
rise
,
said
he, I have no
taste
for
these
fine romantic
scenes
. You knelt,
because
you were told it would be expected,
not from any genuine
impulse
of the heart.
My poor mother looked
distressed
. I hope,
said
I, in a faultering voice, I hope,
sir
,
my conduct will henceforth convince my dear
parents, that I am wanting in neither duty
nor affection. We
shall
see
,
said
he,
carelessly
. You women in general talk
well, but as to your obedience and
submission
,
when you are put to the trial you
always
fall far
short
of your
professions
. I
saw
the tears
stand
in my mother's eyes.
Oh! cried the unfeeling man, if you are for
a whimpering party, I
shall
leave you to
yourselves
, and go and
finish
my game at
piquet with Mrs. Talbot.
When he was gone, I felt
myself
relieved,
and entered into
conversation
with my
mother
and Mrs. Mirvan: though I could not
but
observe
the hard
struggle
my dear
parent
had to
repress
her tears; I dared not
notice her
distress
,
least
by
so
doing, I
should
increase
it:
besides
I judged, that however
palpable my father's errors might be, it
would be an ungrateful
subject
to her,
especially
from the lips of a child.
For the
first
sew
days after my arrival, we
flattered
ourselves
, that Mrs. Mirvan was
much better; but this enchanting
illusion
soon
vanished
. We had been one morning
chatting on her evident amendment, and
she
told me, when able to
support
the fatigue of
a journey,
she
would go to the
south
of
France, and I
should
accompany her. She
wished
my mother to go; but that dear good
woman,
says
she
, can never leave your
father
for
so
long a time, (and his fortune
being
but
small
will not allow the whole
family
to take
such
a journey.) At dinner time,
she
eat the wing of a chicken, and
seemed
to
cat with an appetite; after which
she
drank
a
glass
of Madeira; and in a
short
time
complaining
of
drowsiness
, laid down on the
sopha
;
my mother retired to her own room,
and I took up a volume of Pope's Homer, to
amuse
myself
. For
some
time, her
sleep
seemed
composed
, but
she
soon
grew
restless
,
breathed quick, and frequently
started
,
every
now and then fetching a deep
sigh
, which
terminated in a kind of
convulsive
groan. I
was alarmed and rang the bell, but before
any one
answered
it, I perceived my
beloved
godmother was in
strong
convulsions
; my
shrieks
brought the whole family to the
room; a
physician
was
sent
for, but alas!
nothing could be done. She was
immediately
put to bed; but never recovered her
senses
until a few moments before the final
scene
closed
. In that
short
interval,
she
beckoned
my mother towards her, and putting
my hand in hers, thus
addressed
me, though
with difficulty. Meriel, you are the only
comfort that dear
suffering
saint
possesses
; let
mutual
friendship
cement the bonds of
natural
affection; my child never
forsake
your
mother,
so
shall
the father of mercies never
forsake
you. I
clasped
my arms round my
weeping parent, and articulated a vow to
heaven, never to let her know a grief or
pain, it was in my power to remove. My
fortune, my peace of mind, my reputation,
my life, every thing but integrity of heart,
should
be
sacrificed
to
insure
her felicity.
Enough, my child, faintly cried Mrs.
Mirvan, the Creator of the
universe
has
heard, and accepts your vow. Oh Meriel!
continued
she
, after a
pause
, let it be thro'
life ever
present
to your memory, that you
must
one day be as I am now, trembling on
the verge of eternity. Love thy Maker
above all things, and thy fellow creatures as
thyself
; 'tis that alone can
support
.She
could articulate no more, but her lips
still
moved. She
clasped
her hands
earnestly
;
raised
her eyes toward
those
blissful
regions
to which her pure
soul
aspired
, and with a
placid
smile
sunk
to eternal
rest
.
Oh!
said
I, as I dropped on my knees
by her bed
side
, let me live a life of
purity
,
that my death may be like hers. Amen,
amen, cried my mother, as the
raised
me
from the ground. We retired to her
apartment
,
where
clasped
in each others arms,
we pour'd forth that tribute of affliction, the
merits of our
lost
friend demanded.
IN CONTINUATION.
April
24
th
.
I was
so
oppressed
by the melancholy
subject
,
that I could not for
some
time
resume
it. Pardon me, Celia, I do not mean to
tritrifle
with your friendly anxiety, I
shall
,
therefore
,
pursue
my narrative.
When we had attended all that remained
of the amiable Mrs. Mirvan to the grave;
our family returned to Woodbine Cot. I do
not
speak
of the conduct of my father
during
this melancholy period,
because
it could
neither excite my veneration or your
esteem
.
Mrs. Talbot conducted
herself
with great
propriety, exerted
herself
to comfort and
cheer my mother, tho' I cannot tell why
that dear woman did not receive her
attentions
with that grateful
sweetness
, which
she
ever
manifested
to others. I think Mrs.
Talbot a
most
engaging woman. She is not
so
handsome
as my mother, but has a great
deal more vivacity. She is tall, well made,
and has a very
expressive
countenance, is
affable, conciliating and extremely
sensible
;
she
is
so
kind as to
assist
and direct my
studies
.
You know I am very fond of
natural
history
. She frequently reads to me,
and afterwards we
saunter
thro' the
garden
,
fields and meadows in
search
of
subjects
to
illustrate
what we have read. In
these
rambles my mother accompanies us,
but it grieves me to
see
such
a
settled
melancholy
impressed
upon her countenance.
My brother Richard
yesterday
came from
school
for a few days. I can percieve he is
my father's favourite, indeed my mother is
extremely partial to him, tho' it is with pain
I remark many unamiable traits appear
evident
in his
disposition
, tho' as yet he has
seen
but thirteen years, being three years
younger than
myself
. His behaviour to me
was very ungracious, when we were
first
introduced
to each other. Tho' I had never
seen
him, yet as children of the
same
parents
I felt my heart drawn toward him by an
irresistable
impulse
. I therefore on hearing of
his arrival, ran down
stairs
and was going
to welcome him with a cordial embrace, but
the frigid
coldness
that his countenance
displayed
repressed
my ardour. He advanced,
just
touched my cheek and bowing
profoundly
,
wished
me joy of my fortune. Joy!
brother
said
I, indeed I have not thought of
any thing but regret, for the
sad
occasion
of
my becoming
mistress
of this fortune; would
to heaven! dear Mrs. Mirvan were
still
alive
to enjoy
those
few
thousands
, the
acquisition
of which cannot
compensate
to me for the
loss
of her valuable
society
. She was to
be
sure
a good old woman,
said
he,
carelessly
,
but you know
sister
,
she
was very infirm,
so
I think
she
is much happier out of the
world than in it. Come, come Richard,
said
my mother, with a look, half
smiling
,
half frowning, I
must
not hear you
speak
lightly of an event, which has
so
highly
distressed
us all.
Master
Richard
smiled
contemptuously
,
turned on his heel, hummed a
tune and walked out of the room. How
happens it, Celia, that the child of a woman
possessed
of
such
an excellent heart, and
such
exquisite
sensibility
should
be
so
very
unfeeling; perhaps you will
say
he cannot
resemble
both parents; true, too true, it is
a
just
remark; but oh how
superiatively
happy would be my lot if both
those
parents
resembled
each other.
We live very retired, my father's income
will not
suffer
him to
associate
with the
higher
class
of inhabitants of the village, and his
pride keeps him from
those
in the middling
or lower walks of life. We are, therefore,
visited
by very few, nor among
those
few
have I
seen
one, with whom my heart would
claim acquaintance. Surely, Celia, there
must
be women in the world, and young
women too, who are different from any I
have
seen
here. There are two families whom
my mother is permitted to
visit
, and there
are daughters in each family: but whenever
we meet, which indeed is but
seldom
; they
have
so
much to tell me concerning their
lovers, their
dresses
and their petty
differences
with each other, that we have not a
moment for rational
conversation
.
By this account you will naturally
suppose
my time cannot
pass
in the
most
agreeable
manner. I devote great part of my
mornings to reading, drawing,
music
, and
needle work, and had I but my Celia here
I could be tolerably
easy
; though I can
never
be happy, while I
see
my mother
oppressed
with
sorrow
, which I can neither
participate nor relieve. I have had little or
no
conversation
with my father; as he
still
continues the
same
indifference towards me
which I experienced at our
first
meeting. I
shall
continue to write to you my friend,
tho' I can
foresee
my letters will contain but
little variety: however it will be the means
of keeping alive that
friendship
, which is to
me
so
valuable, and a time may come when
I
shall
be again happy in your
society
. Till
then believe me in
sincerity
yours.
MERIEL HOWARD.

LETTER II.
MRS. TALBOT to LUCETTA ASKHAM.
May 2d
.
Meriel
is returned from the continent,
where
she
has been from a
state
of
infancy
immured in a gloomy convent. Mrs.
Howard did not think her own family a
proper
place for the tuition of a girl. She was
right: her
husband
is by no means a
brilliant
example, and I think, it would be a
fortunate
circumstance
for young Howard was
any thing to happen that might
seperate
him
from his father. Meriel is not what is
generally
termed a fine girl;
she
is rather
below
the middle
size
, and inclined to
en bon
point;
her face is not regularly pretty, but
she
has a lovely pair of hazel eyes, through
which you may read every emotion of her
soul
. She is fair, a fine glow of health
animates
her face, and a
smile
of good humour
plays about her mouth; a luxuriant
quantity
of
chesnut
hair hangs in ringlets down
her neck and
shades
a forehead that is
ornamented
with the
most
beautiful eye-brows I
ever beheld. Yet
she
is not
striking
at
first
sight
, indeed, you would rather be tempted to
say
she
was plain, but the moment
she
speaks
you
must
be charmed. I have heard women
sing
who have fine voices; but I would
rather
hear Meriel read a pathetic tale than
listen
to the
finest
singers
in England. The
melody of her voice, is
so
soft
that
she
makes
the
meanest
subject
interesting
; her
countenance
intelligent, her mind fraught with
every gentle, generous virtue, but withall
she
is the pure child of nature. I could not
have believed it
possible
for a girl of
sixteen
to be
so
artless
and innocent. An entire
stranger
to deception,
she
seeks
not to
disguise
one emotion of her heart. She loves
neither her father nor her brother. I
cannot
blame her, their
souls
are not
congenial
with her own. Yet does
she
strive
by
respect
and attention to attone for the
deficiency
.
I am
so
charmed with this dear girl,
who is a brilliant model of her mother's
virtues
;
with this difference, Mrs. Howard's
are
passive
virtues: Meriel's will prove active
ones. I am
so
captivated with her gentle
innocence that I find I can no longer remain
in the family: Lucetta aid me to fly from
infamy, from
shame
, from a black train of
evils that I
see
ready to
encompass
me. You
start
, you do not
understand
; nor can I at
present
assume
sufficient
courage to explain
my meaning. Oh! my
sister
, I am not
worthy
of your affection, I cannot
pursue
the
subject
.
Adieu, I will write again
soon
.
C. TALBOT.
LETTER III.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Woodbine Cot
,
May 3d
, 1775.
Celia
, if you value your own
happiness
never
desire
to quit the convent.
When I was there, I imagined my father
a worthy character. Had I never left it, I
had never been undeceived: indeed, it is a
sad
,
sad
thing to reflect on, but this man,
whom nature, religion, every
sacred
tie
obliges me to
respect
and love: this very
man is a libertine, and an infidel. He came
one Sunday morning into the library, where
I was reading. Well my pretty
rose
-bud,
said
he, for he generally calls me by
some
such
unaccountable name; What are
your
studies
? Rowe's letters, I replied.
What do you read
such
stuff
as that for?
cried he, pulling the book out of my hand,
'Tis time enough for you to read
such
serious
nonsense
some
forty or fifty years hence,
and here is that
stupid
fellow Harvey too,
continued he, taking up a book that lay
upon
the table. Why child,
these
ridiculous
books are enough to turn your head; they
might have done well enough in a convent,
but
surely
you may find
something
more
amusing
in this collection. I read
these
serious
authors by choice,
sir
,
said
I. You
have a
strange
taste
for a girl of your age
then, he replied, but I don't believe you
speak
as you think. Come tell me
honestly
,
Meriel, continued he
sitting
, down
beside
me, did you never get any novels or
romances
in the convent? You may
suppose
I
stared
at him, for you know we never
saw
a
book of the kind, during the whole time we
were together; of this I
assured
him: to
which he replied; then that
easily
accounted
for my
taste
. He then began to
speak
of religion, and the
sacred
writings in
a manner that made me tremble. At
first
,
I thought he meant only to try me; but
C 2
finding the more I
opposed
his
sentiments
, the
stronger
were the arguments he advanced
to confute, as he
said
, my
foolish
bigotry,
to a
subject
which was not worthy the
attention
of any but old women and children.
I
rose
from my
seat
and
bursting
into tears,
cried, oh!
sir
, if
these
are indeed your
sentiments
they
shock
me to the
soul
. Come
girl, come don't cry,
said
he, pulling me
toward him; you
must
try to get the
better of
these
superstitious
notions, and
learn to think and act for
yourself
,
unbiased
by the prejudices of others. I could not
answer
for my tears. He took me in his
arms and
kissed
me; but my
soul
shrunk
back
from his embrace. My mother
just
then
passing
the window, he left me and went
into
the garden to join her. I do not like
this Mrs. Talbot,
so
well as I did at
first
; I
saw
my father take a liberty with her
yesterday
when they thought they were
unobserved
.
There was an impropriety in it, which
made me
shudder
; and a thought darted
across
my mind which
almost
stunned
my
faculties:
surely
they cannot be
so
very
abandoned. Oh my poor mother! I fear,
this too well explains the
cause
of your
tears and dejection.
May
5
th
.
It is as I
suspected
, Mrs. Talbot is an
unworthy
woman. This morning, I
arose
earlier
than common, intending, the weather
being
sine
, to walk into the meadows, before
breakfast
,
passing
my mother's chamber door
I
saw
it was partly open; and, looking in, I
percieved my dear mother
raised
upon her
elbow in the bed, the tears
streaming
down
her face, and
sobbing
, as tho' her heart would
break. Unable to
restrain
myself
, I
rushed
into the room and ardently
requested
to
know the
cause
of her grief. She
hastily
endeavoured
to dry her tears and
compose
her
countenance,
assured
me that nothing
particular
was the matter, but that
she
often was
seized
with
those
involuntary
fits
of
weeping
,
for which
she
could
assign
no
cause
. Oh! my dear mother,
said
I, you cannot
thus deceive a child, who loves you as I do.
Long have I noticed the anxiety that weighs
heavy at your heart, and preys upon your
spirits
. Can you, do you think your
daughter
unworthy to be
trusted
with your
sorrows
.
Believe me I will
treasure
them in my
bosom
as a
sacred
deposit
, and having
eased
your labouring
breast
of the painful burthen
will pour into it the balm of
consolation
.
My dear girl, my only comforter,
said
my
mother;
seek
not to know what will only
make you unhappy, I cannot be more
so
than
I am already,
said
I, for how is it
possible
I
can be at peace when you are the victim of
concealed
anguish
? Oh! my child,
said
she
, I cannot explain to you the nature of
my
sorrows
, without
acusing
one, whom it
is your duty to
respect
, I
must
not make my
child
dispise
her father; I will not
despise
him, I replied. If he can injure
goodness
like your's I will pity and pardon him,
and pray to heaven to turn his heart. But
where is my father. He has been out all night
said
my mother. While you were at Mr.
Rowley's
yesterday
, he went out and has not
returned
since
.
Just
then I heard a
chaise
drive up to the door and looking out
saw
my
father alight and hand out Mrs Talbot; the
mystery
is unravelled
said
I; go,
said
my
mother, dry your eyes and appear at
breakfast
as
composed
as you can; do not let them
have the triumph of
seeing
how much they
distress
us. I did as I was
desired
, but when
I entered the
breakfast
parlour, I felt a glow
of indignation
flush
my cheek, and I could
hardly give them the compliments of the
morning with any
steadiness
of accent. Mrs.
Talbot fixed her penetrating black eyes
upon
my face; I darted at her a look of anger,
she
immediately
cast
them down, turned pale
and
seemed
much agitated; but whether it was
with anger or
sensibility
I cannot determine.
May 6th, 1775
.
This Mrs. Talbot is a wonderful woman:
her conduct is an inexplicable riddle; her
character
undefinable. With
some
of the
finest
sentiments
that can elevate human nature,
and with the power to act up to
those
sentiments
,
she
has
sunk
herself
upon a level
the
meanest
of her
sex
. I at one and the
same
moment admire, love, pity and
dispise
her: but I will inform you of the
cause
of
these
contradictory
sentiments
.
Yesterday
afternoon as my mother, Mrs.
Talbot and
myself
were at tea, my
father
came in from a walk and throwing a
folded paper into Mrs. Talbot's lap, told her
he had met with a travelling pedlar and
had brought her a
present
. She unfolded
the paper, and
seeing
a piece of fine chintz,
enquired if there was enough for two gowns.
No,
said
my father, I bought but one.
Then certainly, Sir, you did not mean it
for me; only your
politeness
leads you to
offer it; permit me to
resign
it to the
proper
owner, laying it on my mother's knee.
Then, you
refuse
my
present
, Kate,
said
my father
sternly
. I do indeed,
says
she
,
with
firmness
, and am
resolved
on no
account
whatever to accept another obligation
at your hands. I have too long forgot what
was due to this
respectable
family, to your
honour, and to
myself
. It is time to amend
and fly from errors, which originated in
duplicity
on one
side
, and
weakness
on the
other. I have wrote to my
sister
, that I
shall
leave Woodbine Cot to-morrow, and
nothing
shall
prevent my putting my
design
in execution. During the time Mrs.
Talbot was
speaking
, my father
stood
like
one petrefied; my mother's colour went
and came alternately red and pale. Indeed
I was afraid
she
would have fainted. At
length
she
assumed
sufficient
courage to
ask
with tolerable
composure
, how long
she
had
formed this
resolution
, which appeared as
sudden
as it was unexpected. Oh! my
dear madam,
said
she
, it is not a
sudden
resolution
, I have long had it in my mind,
but always wanted fortitude to execute my
resolves
; it is much
easier
to
rush
into guilt,
than to recede from it, and I have long
learnt to
detest
my own vices without
making
one attempt to eradicate them. This
dear young lady has compleated a
reformation
,
which your
gentleness
and virtue had
begun. Believe me, madam, had I
sooner
known, how very amiable you were, I
should
never have injured you; but I was a
stranger
to your
goodness
till it was too late to
recall my error. When
Miss
Howard
returned
from France, it was
impossible
to be
an inmate in the
house
with her and not
love her. From loving virtue in others we
by degrees
wish
to
possess
it
ourselves
;
because
we are
conscious
that without it we
cannot be
respected
or
esteemed
by the
worthy
part of mankind. I
wished
to obtain
Miss
Howard's
friendship
; but I knew I was
unworthy of the
blessing
. From that
moment
I determined, if I could not merit her
esteem
, I would at
least
avoid her
displeasure
and contempt; but alas! continued
she
,
I am too late;
she
already
despises
me,
and I feel I have not even a claim to her
pity.
For heaven's
sake
! what does all this
mean,
said
my father, who dares treat
you with contempt, or
insult
you with their
pity?
No one, Mr. Howard,
she
replied
calmly; I only
say
it is what I have a right
to expect; if you remember I told you a few
days
since
that I was determined no longer
to lead a life of infamy; you thought me
then in
jest
; perhaps you may think
so
still
;
believe me, 'tis of little
consequence
to me,
what opinion you may form of my conduct;
I am anxious only to obtain the pardon of
these
ladies, of
whose
merits I could
wish
you to be
sensible
, before you have
inevitably
destroyed
both their
happiness
and your
own. She then
rose
from her
seat
, and
taking one of my mother's hands, and one of
mine,
pressed
them alternately to her lips,
and
bursting
into a
fresh
flood of tears, left
the room. My father followed her, and I
heard them
speak
very high in the adjoining
apartment, but could
distinguish
nothing
that
past
excepting the words, never
whilst
I have life, which were pronounced by Mrs.
Talbot, as
she
went up
stairs
, where
she
locked
herself
into her own room. My
father
went immediately out, nor was he
returned
while I
sat
up with my mother, who
seemed
more melancholy than ever, and not
inclined for
conversation
. This morning
when we met at
breakfast
a heavy cloud
hung on my father's brow. Mrs. Talbot was
not come down. I went up to call her. The
door was open. I went into the room; but
found, by a letter which lay on the table,
that
she
had left the
house
at four o'clock in
the morning. The cloaths and other
presents
,
which
she
had received from my
father
,
were packed up in a
small
trunk and
directed for me. In her letter to my
mother
,
she
takes a long adieu, and
says
there
is not the
least
probability of our ever
meeting
again, as
she
should
leave England
almost
immediately. It is
impossible
to
describe
the
rage of my father, when he found
she
was
really gone. He
swore
we had treated her
ill, or
she
never would have taken
such
a
resolution
.
In vain we
protested
our innocence.
He vented his rage in the
most
ungentleman-like
terms, on my dear patient
mother
,
who could return nothing but tears.
He is now taking his
usual
walk. I hope,
when he returns, he will be calmer. I am
weary, my dear Celia, and can write no
more. Farewell. May good angels guard
you.
MERIEL.
LETTER IV.
MRS. TALBOT to LUCETTA ASKHAM.
Woodbine Cot
,
May
5
th
, 1775.
I found
myself
at the
conclusion
of my
last
letter, my dear
sister
, totally unable
to continue the
subject
, which I
just
hinted
to you. I
wished
you to conceive the whole
without
descending
to particulars, yet how is
that
possible
. At this moment you think me a
Vol. I. D
virtuous, but unfortunate woman; you
also
think Mr. Howard the
most
benevolent,
most
disintersted
of men: ah! my dear
sister
,
how have you been deceived. But to
make you
understand
more perfectly, I
must
go back to the time when I
lost
Mr.
Talbot.
A
stranger
in London, alone unconnected
with the world, deprived of the means of
support
by my
husband
's death. I was
revolving
in my mind what plan to
pursue
in
future; when chance introduced me to Mr.
Howard. My
dress
declared me a widow.
He paid me innumerable little attentions,
whenever we met at the
house
of an attorney,
with
whose
lady I was intimate, and at length
from having frequently called with my
friend, who was employed to
settle
my late
husband
's affairs, he
assumed
the privilege
of
visiting
by
himself
. To you, who know
him
so
well, I need not
describe
either the
graces of his
person
, or his
insinuating
address
.
Perfect
master
of the art of deception;
he conceals under the
mask
of integrity and
honour every vice which can
disgrace
human
nature: with that
versatality
of temper which
makes him appear every thing to every
body
;
with the religious he is grave and
solemn
;
with the gay cheerful and affable,
with the
splenetic
he can rail at the vices and
follies of mankind, and with the libertine
practice
those
vices
himself
: tho' where it is
his
interest
he can appear devout, yet no man
ever concieved a more contemptuous opinion
of religion, or
strove
with more diabolical
earnestness
to corrupt the young and
inexperienced
heart. When
first
I was
introduced
to him, I was told he was a married man.
What was my wonder, then, when after a
few
visits
he
professed
a
passion
for me. I
combated his
sophistical
arguments as well as
my weak
reasoning
would permit; but alas!
I
lost
ground in every argument. At length
he told me as a
secret
, which nothing but the
most
violent
passion
could have extorted
from him, that he never did, nor ever could
love his wife; that he had married her
solely
to oblige his father, who was
since
dead, and
that
she
was a cold, inanimate woman, fit
only
for the frigid rules, and
solemn
rites of a
convent. Then with the
most
solemn
affeverations
,
he called heaven to
witness
that I
was the only woman he ever loved; and
called down the
most
heavy maledictions on
his head, if he
should
ever
forsake
me.
Lucetta, I was infatuated; I thought him
the
tenderest
,
best
of men, and mourn'd a
fate which had united him to a woman he
could not love. Poverty and
distress
surrounded
me. Mr. Howard offered a
settlement
of fifty pounds a year and to take me
into his family, as a relation of his own. My
sister
, do you now concieve the depth of my
shame
. I accepted his offer, and a letter
was
dispatched
, to let Mrs. Howard know,
he had met with a relation,
whose
circumstances
were rather
embarrassed
and whom
he had invited home, as he thought
she
would prove an agreeable addition to their
family
.
The return of
post
brought
such
an
answer
as might be expected from a woman,
whose
chief
study
was to
please
and render
her
husband
happy. When I arrived at
Woodbine Cot, Mrs. Howard recieved me
with a mixture of
politeness
and affection.
Never
shall
I forget the
sensations
, which
pervaded my
bosom
, when entering a neat
parlour
she
rose
to welcome me.
Astonishment
riveted me to the
spot
; unable to
speak
or move, I
sunk
into the
nearest
chair, and
had nearly fainted. Figure to
yourself
, my
sister
, a woman,
scarcely
thirty years old,
elegantly
formed, with a countenance animated
and
prepossessing
; her fine blue eyes
beaming
tenderness
on the cruel betrayer of her
peace. Think you hear her in accents
soft
as the
music
of the
spheres
, by turns
cheering
and comforting the very woman who
had robbed her of her
husband
's affections.
And
surely
then, you will not wonder, if
unable
to
stifle
my emotions, I gave way to a
flood of tears. You are too much
affected
,
my dear madam,
said
Mrs. Howard,
taking my hand. Do not I
beseech
you
give way to immoderate grief: when
misfortunes
are irremidiable it is our duty to
submit
without repining: but I flatter
myself
,
the united attentions of my dear Mr.
Howard, and
myself
, will by degrees
restore
your tranquility. In the mean time, I hope
you will
consider
yourself
at home, and be
assured
, we
shall
think
ourselves
happy in
being able in the
least
to contribute to your
ease
or felicity. She then led me to an
appartment
,
which had been prepared for me,
and left me, to that
repose
which
conscious
guilt rendered me incapable of enjoying.
The more I knew of this amiable woman,
the greater
cause
I found for admiration and
respect
. She being naturally of an open
disposition
, I was in the
course
of our
intimacy
,
made acquainted with the
most
material
circumstances
of her life: and from her
I learnt that
she
had brought a very
handsome
fortune to Mr. Howard; and that they
had married contrary to the advice of their
friends on both
sides
, as they had formed
different views for them: but,
said
she
, with
a
sigh
, We thought love for each other
would
compensate
for the privation of the
society
of our other friends.
D 2
I had not been long in this family, before
I
discovered
, that I was not the only woman,
who
shared
Mr. Howard's attention. He was
neither careful to avoid
suspicion
, nor
delicate
in the choice of his companions, as
almost
every female
servant
in the family, who
was not proof
against
flattering vows and
presents
of finery, had at
some
time or other
attracted her
master
's notice. The amiable
suffering
wife bore all with angelic patience,
nor ever once breathed a murmur. I had
the
satisfaction
to find that my
remonstrances
had
some
effect, and he became
more
circumspect
in his behaviour. I could
also
at any time
restrain
him from the
pursuit
of any new amour by threatning to leave
him, and I flattered
myself
, that this in
some
measure
attoned to Mrs. Howard for the
injuries
I did her. In this manner I continued
in the family near three years, when I found
an evident alteration in the conduct of my
hostess
. Her manner was cold and
distant
;
she
often avoided my
society
and retired to
her apartment, where I have
surprized
her
weeping.
Conscious
guilt would not
permit
me to enquire the
cause
of her
uneasiness
,
as I naturally imagined
she
had
discovered
my improper intimacy with her
husband
:
but one day while we were at
Bristol
,
I overheard a
conversation
between them
which determined me to quit a life, at once
so
repugnant to honour, humanity and
religion
.
It was one morning, as I was
preparing
to enter the
breakfast
room, the door
of which was not quite
shut
, when I heard
Mr. Howard in a high key reproaching his
wife for not behaving
so
kindly as formerly
to me. I
wished
to know in what manner
Mrs. Howard
spoke
of me, and therefore
descended
to the
meanness
of
listening
. My
dear, Mr. Howard,
said
she
, how is it
possible
for me to behave with cordiality to a
woman
who I am well convinced has
usurped
my
place in your affections; and tho' I am
willing
acknowledge the many amiable traits in
her character, I cannot be blind to that one
error, which embitters every hour of my
life; nor am I
mistress
of
sufficient
dissimulation
,
to wear the face of
friendship
where
my heart feels only
dislike
, nay
almost
disgust
.
I will not
scruple
to
confess
, I once
did
esteem
her: but pardon the
expression
,
if I
say
, the heart that loves virtue for its own
sake
, can never form acquaintance with vice.
We may pity, but we
must
despise
.
Hold madam,
said
he, or I
shall
be
led to
suppose
you
despise
me.
No, Mr. Howard,
said
she
, with a
firm animated voice, you are the
chosen
friend of my heart, the father of my
children
,
the
husband
of my affections, I have
promised
to love, to honour, and obey you,
and heaven is my
witness
, I never have failed
in one of
those
points: to
cease
to love you
is
impossible
; to obey you is the
pleasure
of
my life: but, pardon me, if your own
conduct
has forced me unwillingly to own, I
can no longer honour you; my peace has
been broken by your ill humour, my fortune
dissipated
by your extravagance, nay
lavished
on the
most
disolute
of my
sex
, until your
family is reduced to the
most
mortifying
circumstances
:
my child, my beloved Meriel
obliged to be educated far from me;
because
her father's morals were too vitiated to be a
proper object for the contemplation of a
young and innocent mind.
Here
she
wept, and Mr. Howard not being
able to make a
just
defence, flew into a
violent
passion
, as was his
usual
custom
,
swore
she
was a
most
unacountabIe woman, and
wondered at his own patience in bearing
with her
so
long. This
undeserved
reproach
awakened her
stifled
passion
, and
she
answered
with intrepidity.
No,
sir
, it is my patience is to be
wondered
at, but do not irritate me, beyond the
possibility
of
submitting
any longer, I fear I have
been wrong in
so
long bearing my injuries in
silence
; perhaps, you think,
because
I
appeared
blind to your immoral conduct, I
countenanced it. Let me undeceive you.
Mrs. Talbot
should
not
so
long have
remained
under the
same
roof with me, had I not
feared, that by depriving her of an
asylum
,
I
should
injure her reputation and drive her
into an inhuman world, where one
false
step
is never forgiven, and
she
might have
sunk
into the
lowest
abyss
of vice and infamy. I
flattered
myself
my
gentleness
might have
reclaimed her. I knew, alas! too well, the
inconstancy
of your nature, and had
determined
that when
forsaken
by you,
she
should
not want a friend to
snatch
her from
everlasting
ruin.
I was
so
overcome by this generous
declaration
,
that I was forced to catch hold of
the
ballustrade
of the
stairs
, to prevent
falling
.
A
sudden
sickness
came over me, and
I could not
distinctly
hear the remainder of
their
conversation
; but, thank heaven, I
profited
so
much from what I had heard, that
I
resolved
no longer, by my
presence
, to
wound a heart
so
replete with benevolence
toward me. I did not enter the parlour;
but returned to my own apartment; and,
sending
an apology for not appearing at
breakfast
, revolved in my own mind a
variety
of
schemes
, for my future
subsistence
; but
could think on nothing that appeared in the
least
probable of
success
. That afternoon
Miss
Howard arrived from France. Had my
mind been ever
so
depraved it
must
have
returned to virtue after an acquaintance with
this dear girl; I therefore became more
firm in my
resolves
; and having formed an
acquaintance with an elderly lady, of
whose
sense
and
goodness
of heart I had a very
high opinion; I determined to
disclose
every
particular of my
situation
to her, and
ask
her advice in what manner I
should
proceed.
She heard me with attention, and was
friendly
enough not to attempt to paliate my
errors
.
She placed my conduct in a proper
light and encouraged the
remorse
which was
already awakened in my
bosom
. She then
opened a
scene
of comfort to my
distressed
imagination, and having
advised
me to
return
with the family to Woodbine Cot, to
prevent any ill natured remarks among our
acquaintance, and afterwards to
pursue
the
plan which
she
had laid down. Yet, will
you believe it, when I returned to this place
I felt my
resolution
slacken
, and found I was
relapsing
into my former errors; but this
morning the dear amiable Meriel has
awakened
my
sleeping
conscience
, and I am
determined
to leave the family immediately.
I went into the garden after
breakfast
and
found her weeping in a little arbour. In
tears, my dear little girl,
said
I. Have
I not
cause
for tears,
she
replied, is not
my beloved mother unhappy?
Unhappy!
said
I, with an accent of
surprise
, willing to try if
she
was acquainted
with the
cause
.
She fixed her
expressive
eyes on my face,
and replied emphatically;
surely
I need
not tell you, Mrs. Talbot, that
she
is very
unhappy; for you
profess
yourself
her friend,
and
friendship
is quick
sighted
in
discerning
the
sorrows
of the
person
esteemed
: true
friendship
is
also
eagerly anxious to remove
the
cause
of grief from the
bosom
of
those
they love, though by
so
doing, they plant a
thorn in their own.
I could not
answer
her; I did not even
attempt it; but
pressing
her hand in
silence
retired to another part of the garden.
On
Tuesday
morning, at four o'clock, I
shall
expect you will
send
a man and
horse
for me. I
shall
come but poorly provided
with
cash
, as I am
resolved
to leave my
settlement
behind me, as
likewise
every
present
of value, which I have received. I will not
impoverish
the family which I have already
irreparably injured. But do not think I
shall
come to throw
myself
on you for
support
.
No, my
sister
, I have the abilities
necessary
to
earn my
subsistence
, and they
shall
be
exerted
.
I
shall
stay
only one night with you, and
then proceed to my kind friend at
Bristol
.
As to the remainder of my plan, if I
succeed
to my
wish
, you
shall
again hear from me;
if not, I
shall
sink
at once into total oblivion.
Farewell, my
sister
, forget my errors;
remember
only my penitence, and let me
share
your prayers, that it may be
sincere
and
lasting
.
C. TALBOT.
LETTER V.
MERIEL HOWARD to CELIA SHELBURNE.
Woodbine Cot
,
May
7
th
, 1775.
My
father is more
composed
, than I
could imagine
possible
in the
absence
of Mrs. Talbot; but he is
still
gloomy and
unsocial
with my mother; however, I cannot
but flatter
myself
that time, and her
unwearied
assiduities
, will regain his affections; and
was that to be the happy
result
of her
patience
and forbearance, how great would be
our felicity.
Miss
Dolly Pringle has
just
called to
solicit
my mother's leave for my drinking tea
with her. It is but
seldom
I am permitted
to go without the boundaries of our garden,
except to accompany my father or mother
in a retired walk; but for a wonder, I am
this afternoon to be
trusted
unaccompanied
by either. I cannot think what my father
is afraid of, that he
should
be
so
averse
to
Vol. I. E
my taking any kind of innocent recreation.
I am
sure
, if I know my own heart, I have
no improper
wishes
lurking there; yet he is
always
saying
such
strange
things about love
and lovers that it
seems
he would be angry
if a man was only to
speak
civil to me. Dolly
knew this odd way of his, and
so
did not
tell him that her brother was expected to
come from London for a few days, and
most
likely would arrive this afternoon. I am
sure
,
said
she
to me, you will like Harry
vastly
, and if he is not
smitten
, I
shall
be
surprised
. Pray
Miss
, continued
she
, were
you never in love?
In love,
said
I; really I don't
rightly
comprehend what you mean by the
word.
La! that is
vastly
odd; but never mind
my dear; half an hour's
conversation
with
my brother will explain it better than I could
in a whole day.
But why
Miss
Pringle,
must
your
brother
talk to me of love; I
should
suppose
there were many more
interesting
subjects
.
La!
Miss
,
she
replied
something
tartly
,
you talk like a child I think; why
what
should
a gallant young man
say
to a
beautiful young lady, but that he adored
her; or when did you ever read of a young
gentleman being left to entertain a lady, for
half an hour, but he fell at her feet, called
her a divinity, and vowed to love her while
the vital fluid warmed his heart.
Bless
me!
said
I, I declare I never
read
such
a thing in my life.
Surely then,
she
replied with a look of
surprise
; you never read the divine
history
of lady Frances and lady Caroline, or the
loves of Edward and Harriet? No,
indeed
,
said
I, I have never even heard of
them.
Oh! my dear girl, then, cried
she
,
in a
sort
of
extasy
; you have a
pleasure
to come, of which at
present
you can form
no idea: I will lend you the books; but
you
must
not let your father
see
them.
And that you may believe me Celia, I
shall
not; for he is always ready enough to
abridge me of any thing that can afford me
pleasure
. As to my dear mother, I am
sure
she
will gratify every laudable
wish
of my
heart; and
sure
if
Miss
Pringle has
recieved
so
much
pleasure
in the
perusal
of them,
they cannot be improper books; at any rate,
when one hears a great deal about a thing,
one naturally longs to
see
it. But after all
it appears to me very odd that a man and
woman cannot
converse
together without
making love: I think it is a very
foolish
idea,
and in my opinion a very fallacious one;
for now I remember, Mr. Verdome travelled
all the way from Bologne with me, and
never
said
a
syllable
about love or adoration.
To be
sure
Mr. Verdome is
almost
fifty
years old; but I
should
not
suppose
that
would make any great difference.
May 8th
.
Well, to be
sure
I do begin to be a little
better
pleased
with the
society
of our
neighbours
than I was at
first
; indeed I feel my
heart much lighter
since
Mrs. Talbot left us,
for I
see
my dear mother looks happier; and
if
she
is happy I
shall
be
so
too. I
spent
a
very agreeable evening at Mrs. Pringle's,
whose
son
arrived,
just
as we had
sat
down to tea; I thought him a very
pleasing
young man. He is an
ensign
in the army,
and has a military, manly countenance. I
know not how it was, but whether from
what Dolly had
said
in the morning, or
whether
from my not being
accustomed
to the
society
of men; yet I felt
myself
awkward
and
embarressed
; however, as Mr. Pringle
did not
say
any thing particular, I
soon
recovered
myself
, tho' when Mrs. Pringle and
her daughter left the room for a few
moments
,
I was frightened to death left he
should
make love to me, and you know, if
he had I
should
not have known what to
say
to him. This fear, I am
sure
, made me look
like a fool; for I felt my face glow like
scarlet
. I dare
say
he thought me an idiot:
well, it is of little
consequence
to me what
he thought: only you know one don't like
strangers
to form an
unjust
opinion of our
mental faculties.
Miss
Pringle lent me the books which
she
promised
: I did not dare to read any
before
I went to bed, as my father often walks
round the
house
to
see
if all the lights are
out; and if he had caught me reading, he
would have immediately taken the books
from me, for he has lately taken it into
his head that I read too much, and that I
shall
be good for nothing, if I am
suffered
to
pore
so
much over a parcel of
musty
old
authors
.
So, I locked up my new
acquisitions
in my
closet
, and
arose
two hours earlier
this morning to
peruse
it. Realy, Celia,
these
young ladies who write
so
much, and
so
prettily to each other,
must
be very amiable
and lovely, for you
must
know the whole
book is in letters, it is indeed a charming
E 2
history
; you cannot think how much I
cried
whilst
I was reading. Surely,
said
I,
at one time, it
must
be a
sad
thing to be in
love; and yet unhappy as it makes many,
every body
seems
to be affected with this
strange
passion
; it appears to be their whole
business
. But my father is gone to walk
and my mother retired to her apartment,
which
she
does
almost
every afternoon;
so
,
I may now
snatch
an hour or two to read a
little more.
May 9th
.
Well, Celia, would you believe it, after
having cried
myself
almost
blind about the
the
distresses
of the dear ladies,
whose
history
I have been reading, I was agreeably
surprised
to find, in the end, all parties were
made happy. I declare I was very much
delighted
,
and cannot
say
but I
should
like to
go into more company, and
see
a little more
of life; for then perhaps I
should
meet with
some
such
charming women as lady Frances
and lady Caroline. Celia, I might
also
be
admired by
some
fine gentleman, as they
were; for I find country girls are as much
engaged with love and lovers as the great
ladies. I
wish
I could convey
these
books to
you, or that you could get
some
just
like
them. Perhaps
these
were the kind my
father
meant, when he talked about romances
and novels; but yet that cannot be, as this
is a real
history
, the characters drawn
from life.
Miss
Pringle has
promised
to lend
me
some
more of the
same
sort
, and
some
plays;
so
I think I
shall
pass
my time much
more agreeably than before; tho' do not
think I mean to neglect
those
authors our
dear
sister
Constance
so
strenuously
recommended
to my notice. No, no, my friend,
I will not neglect the
useful
studies
of
history
, geography, and far more
necessary
duty of public and private devotion; and
now I am on the
subject
of devotion, I
must
just
mention
something
in my father's
character
,
which is to me unaccountable. Tho'
he talked to me in the
prosane
stile
I have
related in a former letter, yet to my mother
and the families who
visit
us, he pretends to
have a high veneration for religion and
religious
subjects
, and as we live a
considerable
distance
from the church, he makes a
practice
of reading the morning
service
to the
family
;
tho' perhaps the moment he has
closed
the prayer book,
should
the
most
trisling
thing
happen to ruffle his temper, he will
burst
into
fits of ungovernable rage, and
swear
in
such
a horrible manner, that I
shudder
to
hear him. There is a little boy, whom he
has taken into the family, and whom he
takes great pains to teach his
catechism
, &c.
I have
seen
him whip the poor lad
unmercifully
for innocently humming a
song
tune on
a Sunday morning, when he
himself
lives in
the
constant
breach of
almost
every duty the
christian
religion lays days down for our
observation
and direction. Are not
these
inconsistencies
,
Celia? Surely the father of
children, the
master
of a family,
should
set
a good example, or he can never expect
others to attend to duties he
so
evidently
appears to
disregard
.
My dear old
nurse
, Deborah, arrived
yesterday
,
from a
visit
she
has been paying her
friends ever
since
our return from the
continent
.
She enquired when I had heard from
you;
desires
you will not forget her. Of
this I
assured
her,
she
need not be afraid.
Her return is another
source
of comfort to
me, as my mother
says
she
shall
continue in
the family as long as
she
pleases
, and you
know the affection I have contracted for her,
from her attendance on me the whole time
I was abroad, indeed I
consider
her
almost
in a maternal light, her fidelity and
attachment
to our family has been ever
unshaken
.
Miss
Pringle called this afternoon, and
we walked in the garden together near an
hour, during which time
she
told me her
brother was greatly
struck
with my
person
,
and that he had told his mother, if he
thought I would return his
passion
, he
should
immediately
relinquish
the idea he
had formed of marrying a woman, to whom
the whole family had the
greatest
dislike
, as
she
was ignorant, low born and without
fortune
.
How happy
shall
I be my dear
Miss
Howard,
said
she
, to call you
sister
.
Bless
me,
said
I, how can you talk
so
, you know I
must
not think of
listening
to a lover without my father's
permission
.
Your father indeed, cried
she
laughing,
I wonder what your dear little
simple
head
will fancy next: why child, he would forbid
me the
house
if he only
suspected
such
a
thing; and you know my dear Meriel,
(
she
continned in a
soft
soothing
accent)
you know, we are
bosom
friends and
sworn
sisters
and it would be very hard, you know,
to be
separated
, perhaps forever.
Indeed
Miss
Pringle,
said
I, my
heart feels grateful for the
friendship
you
profess
for me, and I
should
be very
sorry
to
be deprived of your
society
.
Well, then my dear,
said
she
, take
this letter and don't let either your father or
your mother
see
it. I would have
refused
the letter, as I feared it would be improper
to take it; but my father
just
then entering
the garden, I dreaded his anger which is
awakened at the
most
insignisicant
trifles,
and is always impetuous:
so
I
hastily
put it
in my pocket.
When we returned to the
house
and
Miss
Pringle was gone, he cried
pettishly
to my
mother; what does that girl do
so
often
here? I
shall
have Meriel
spoiled
by her
nonsensical
chatter;
besides
I will lay a
guinea
there is an intrigue of
some
sort
contriving
between them; I never knew two girls
allowed
to be
so
much together but they
hatched
mischief
. If you do not like
Dolly Pringle, replied my mother, we
will try to drop her acquaintance, but you
must
consider
, Mr. Howard, Meriel
must
have
some
society
. Why, pray what
society
would
she
have,
said
he, are not
you always with her, and has
she
not plenty
of needle-work to do? let her
stick
close
to
that, and
she
won't want to be gadding and
gossiping
:
she
is at
present
a
stranger
to the
world, and the
less
she
knows of it the
better
.
This
unkindness
does not grieve me
as it would if I loved him; but it gives me
pain to
see
how much it affects my mother.
I
sat
down to
supper
in
silence
, and when it
was
finished
, retired as
usual
to my own
room, where I
haistily
broke the
seal
of my
letter, and found it wrote in
such
a
charming
style
,
so
tender,
so
lively, I read it over
half a dozen times, but could not determine
whether to
answer
it or not. Good night
Celia, it is eleven o'clock, and I dare not
write a moment longer.
MERIEL.
LETTER VI.
MERIEL HOWARD to CELIA SHELBURNE.
Woodbine Cot
,
June
17
th
.
I have
been very unhappy, Celia,
since
I wrote
last
; indeed I did not know
whether
I
should
be permitted to write to you
again: nor could I now enjoy that
satisfaction
if good Deborah had not procured me
pens, ink, and
some
paper; which
she
did
on conditions of
seeing
all I wrote; and I
have left my bed at the early hour of four,
to pour forth my complaints to my dear
Celia. In my
last
I told you I had
recieved
a letter from Mr. Pringle, declaring
himself
my lover: I will own I was very much
pleased
with it. Tho' at
first
I
hesitated
to
answer
it, yet, when I read a few more books,
which
Miss
Dolly Pringle
sent
me by means
of our dairy maid, and I found that none of
the young ladies mentioned in them ever
hesitated
at
answering
their lover's letters; I
ventured to write a few lines in reply to one
which he
sent
me
requesting
me to meet
him one night after the family were in bed,
and in which he told me, Lettice the maid
would come and let me know, when all was
quiet in the
house
, and that
she
would go
with me to the place he had appointed for
our meeting. Indeed, Celia, I did not think
any harm;
so
I wrote and told him if his
sister
would come with him, I would meet him,
for I
wished
very much to
see
Dolly, and I
knew I
should
not have another opportunity
very
soon
.
When we met, his manner was
so
tender,
his language
so
pathetic, and the tender
attentions
of his
sister
so
like what I had read,
that I could not help
confessing
that I pitied
him, and that if it would in the
least
alleviate
his
suffering
, I would meet him there again.
We went on thus for
some
time, when
overpowered
one evening by his entreaties, I
consented
to go with him to London, where he
promised
to marry me. Dear, dear, Celia, I
tremble even now, when I think of what
followed
.
The next day we had
just
done
breakfast
,
when an elderly gentleman who has a
great regard for my father and mother called,
and telling the latter he had
something
very
particular to
say
to her, they walked
together
into the garden. When they returned,
I
saw
my dear mother, oh! I
shall
never
forget
it, I
saw
her look extremely angry, her
eyes darted at me
such
indignant glances,
that my very
soul
felt humbled within me,
I could have fallen at her feet and intreated
to know the
cause
of her anger: for indeed,
Celia, I did not think, if
she
had even
discovered
my
correspondence
with young
Pringle
,
that
she
would have been
so
very much
offended,
especially
as I could appeal for a
precedent, to the conduct of
so
many amiable
young ladies of even rank and fortune. But
the moment Mr. Sutten was gone,
she
asked
me in a tone that rent my very heart, how
I dared either to receive or write letters
without
her knowledge. Her anger overpowered
me;
something
rose
in my throat and
prevented
my
speaking
, I thought I
should
have
died with
sorrow
, when
she
thus continued:
Unkind, ungenerous Meriel, thus to
abuse
Vol. I. F
the confidence your mother had placed in
you. How, degenerate girl, have you dared
to violate the laws of female delicacy, by
openly avowing a
passion
for a man to whom
you are
almost
a
stranger
, and even to make
yourself
ridiculous by writing
such
letters
to him as renders you the
jest
of the whole
village. Oh! my dear mother,
said
I in a
voice
almost
choaked with
sobs
; indeed I
did not think any harm. Perhaps,
Meriel
,
said
she
, had you
stopped
here, I might
have forgiven you: but know,
false
disembling
girl, I have
discovered
all your illicit
plans, you have left your father's
house
at
hours, when
modesty
would have
shrunk
to
venture out, without a proper protector:
and, to compleat your imprudence, this very
night you had
designed
to quit a mother,
whom you have pretended to love and
respect
,
and to throw
yourself
intirely into the
power of a wretch, who regards you only
as a vehicle, thro' which he may come at the
possession
of your fortune.
I fell at her feet and would have taken
her hand; but
she
snatched
it from me, and
and
rising
from her
seat
left me weeping on
the ground.
Unworthy girl,
said
she
, as
she
left the
room, go hide
yourself
from my
sight
, for
you are become odious to me. Never, never,
child, can you regain the confidence you
have
lost
. I had flattered
myself
with
finding
in you a comforter and tender filial
friend; but you have added another wound
to a heart already lacerated by many
forrows
.
When my mother was gone, I laid my
head upon a chair and continued weeping.
In this
position
my father found me. So,
Miss
,
said
he,
sternly
, I find you were for
providing a
husband
for
yourself
; you were
resolved
to
lose
no time; but pray what will
you
say
when I tell you this fine lover of
your's is already married and has been
so
these
two years.
Married,
sir
! cried I,
raising
my head.
Yes child, married, though his friends
were unacquainted with it, but this morning
I hear his wife is arrived from London, with
one child, to
solicit
that
support
which he
has inhumanly
refused
her. I made no
answer
, but returning my head to its
reclining
posture
, continued weeping without
intermission
.
Ah! my poor little Meriel,
said
he, in a tone of voice more
soft
than
usual
, I am afraid this naughty man has
made great havock with your heart; but,
come, come, you
shall
not wear the willow
long, we will find another lover for you
soon
.
Indeed,
sir
, you
mistake
the
cause
of
my tears,
said
I. It is not the
loss
of all
the lovers in the world would grieve me half
so
much as the fear of having forever
forfeited
my dear mother's affection.
Well, well, he replied, don't let
that vex you; if
she
is unkind, I will
endeavour
to attone for it. To be
sure
,
she
is
very
rigid in her notions, but I dare
say
, when
she
sees
you heartily repent your fault,
she
will overlook it and love you as well as
ever.
He then left me, and I retired to my
apartment, where Deborah told me my
mother
had been, and had carried all my pens,
ink and paper away with her. Ever
since
she
has been cold,
distant
, nay
almost
unkind
.
Oh! my dear friend, what
shall
I do
to regain her affection, and convince her my
repentance is
sincere
. Indeed,
she
is to me
the
dearest
object upon earth, and her
happiness
shall
henceforth be my only
study
.
My father, when my mother is
present
,
treats me with equal rigour; but, when we
are alone, he is more gentle. Once or twice
he has come to my apartment when
she
was
out, and even brought me
some
books;
among which were
some
French novels.
Even my brother has heard of my
imprudence
,
and has wrote to my mother,
enquiring
the truth of the report; but he does not
write as if he
wished
it
false
. I do not think
he loves me; he had expected a legacy from
Mrs. Mirvan, but the whole of her fortune
being left to me, has created envy and
jealousy
in a
bosom
, which I had once flattered
myself
I
should
find warm with friendly and
fraternal love: and yet, Celia, if he did but
know my heart, he would
see
he had no
cause
to envy me, except he
should
envy
those
delightful
sensations
which I
shall
feel
when I come to the
possession
of my fortune,
in
saying
, brother, it is equally your's,
command
it to its
utmost
extent.
Deborah has
promised
me to get this
letter
conveyed to the
nearest
post
town. When
you write, direct under cover to Mrs.
Deborah
Ellis, to remain at the office till called
for, I dare not let my mother know I
correspond
with any one,
least
she
should
discover
by what means I got the materials for
writing
,
and poor Deborah would
suffer
for her
affectionate indulgence. I have no
employment
,
no
amusement
, half
so
agreeable as
F 2
scribling
to my Celia,
so
do not be impatient
at the length of my letters.
MERIEL.
LETTER VII.
DEBORAH ELLIS to CELIA SHELBURNE.
Woodbine Cot
,
July 24th
, 1775.
DEAR MISS,
I HOPE, you will pardon this freedom
in a poor old woman, who is
almost
broken
hearted, at an accident which has
distracted
the whole family. I hardly know
how to tell you,
because
I know you loved
and valued my dear young lady; and
so
indeed
must
every one who knew her merits,
tho'
since
she
has returned from France, I
have heard her ridiculed for virtues which
few, if any, endeavoured to imitate; and
have
seen
her drawn into errors, by
those
who, envying the
superior
qualities of her
heart, endeavoured to bring her more on a
level with
themselves
. She
shewed
me the
last
letter
she
wrote to you; for it was only
on condition of
seeing
all
she
wrote, that I
supplied
her with the means of following
her favourite
amusement
. The
sternness
of
her mother
still
continued; and the poor
young lady was abridged of the
pleasure
of
even walking beyond the limits of her
father's
garden. Mr. Howard's conduct,
towards the dear girl, was altogether
unaccountable
,
sometimes
harsh
, unfeelingly
reproaching her for her intended error;
a method, in my poor humble opinion, by no
means calculated to lead her to renounce the
attachment, which hurried her to
so
improper
a
step
. At other times, he turned the
whole affair into ridicule, and
conversed
with
his daughter in a gay familiar manner; but
tho'
she
trembled at his anger,
she
never
expressed
any
satisfaction
in his company when
good humoured; but rather
wished
to
indulge
in
solitude
and
study
. About ten days
since
my
mistress
was
sent
for, into Effex, to
a relation, who was extremely ill. Mr.
Howard did not accompany her:
she
set
off
in the afternoon, and he having procured a
chaise
took
Miss
Meriel out for a ride, an
indulgence
she
had never experienced
since
her
residence
at this place. When
she
returned
she
seemed
very melancholy, and
said
her
spirits
were much
oppressed
, and her
mind
harrassed
with terrors, for which
she
could by no means account. She
supped
with her father and retired at her
usual
hour. Mr. Howard
sat
up much later than
common, and to my great
surprise
, when I
carried in his candle, he
seemed
intoxicated,
tho' he had been alone and
seldom
gave way
to
excessive
drinking,
unless
he had been
led into it by company. I heard him go
into
his apartment, and then went to bed
myself
,
where the fatigue of the day
soon
made
me fall
asleep
. About two o'clock I was
awakened by
Miss
. Howard, who in a
shivering
voice
asked
me if I had not heard a
noise
in her chamber,
said
,
she
was greatly
frightened, and would, if I
pleased
,
stay
the
remainder of the night with me. I helped
her into bed;
she
was cold as death,
trembled
excessivly
, and
soonfell
into a
convulsive
hysteric
fit. Greatly alarmed, I called up
one of my fellow
servants
, and by repeated
applications of
hartshorn
, vinegar, &c.
brought her to
herself
;
she
would give no
account of the
cause
of her fright; but
seemed
to mourn
some
heavy misfortune, and
repeatedly
wished
herself
with you in the
convent
again. She
rested
but little all night,
and the next morning was
so
indisposed
as to be unable to
rise
, and was confined to
her room for
several
succeeding
days. One
day after
she
had ventured down
stairs
; I
asked
leave to go a few miles, on
some
particular
business
, where I was detained all
night, by
reason
of a violent
storm
.
Rising
early in the morning, and walking home
before
any of the family but the
house
maids
was
stirring
, I went up immediately to
see
how my dear
Miss
Meriel was, for I had
been very
uneasy
about her all night,
knowing
she
was terrified at thunder, and would
not dare to
express
her fears to her father,
who would only have ridiculed them. On
entering the room I was alarmed to find the
bed in great
disorder
; many of her cloaths
laying about the floor, the window open,
and my beloved
Miss
Howard gone.
Observing
the
sheets
fastened
to the bed-
post
, I
naturally imagined
she
must
have
slid
by
them into the garden, and looking out at
the window I
saw
one of her
shoes
lay on
the ground. Convinced now, of what
before
I had only conjectured, I gave a
scream
of terror which alarmed my
master
,
who came half
dressed
, pale and trembling
into the room, exclaiming, for God's
sake
what is the
noise
about. My young lady,
sir
,
said
I, pointing to the window.
Eloped
,
said
he, with that villain, Pringle; but
here I
sware
never again to
suffer
Oh,
sir
! cried I eagerly, do not
sware
to
renounce
her; I'd venture my life upon her
innocence; I am
sure
some
vile means have
been
used
to draw her thus from her duty.
She is a little hypocrite,
nurse
,
said
he,
and will make
herself
friends wherever
she
goes, till
she
is found out. I
suppose
she
will
trump up
some
fine
story
about ill
usage
, or
some
devilish
thing or other. I
wish
to my
soul
she
had never left the convent; this will
go near to break her mother's heart.
About noon Mrs. Howard returned. It is
impossible
to
describe
her
anguish
when
informed
of her daughter's
absence
(I will not
say
elopement)
because
I am
sure
, if the truth
was known, it would not
deserve
so
harsh
an
appellation. She
sent
immediately to Mrs.
Pringle's, where
she
heard that the young
gentleman went away, as he
said
, to join his
regiment the afternoon before. Thus does
this unlucky
circumstance
tend to make it
universally
believed, that
Miss
Howard and
Mr. Pringle are together; but, indeed
Miss
,
I do not think that is the
case
; for, certain I
am, that a purer heart never inhabited a
human
bosom
, and that
she
never would have
thought of eloping with a married man:
besides
,
I am convinced
she
was not greatly
attached
to him. He was the
first
man who had
ever
addressed
her;
she
is the pure child of
undisguised
nature, and being
pleased
with his
attentions which had the charm of novelty
to recommend them;
she
fancied
herself
in
love; but after her conduct had been placed
in a proper light, by her mother,
she
seemed
perfectly convinced of her error, and often
used
to
say
,
she
wondered how
she
could
imagine
she
loved a man, of whom
she
knew
so
little. I
should
think,
nurse
,
said
she
one
day, that this unfortunate affair in the end
would be greatly beneficial to me, as it will
make me, in future,
distrust
the emotions of
my heart, and be upon my guard
against
its
deceptions; but I fear it has irreparably
injured
me in the opinion of my mother; but
I
must
endeavour, by my future conduct, to
regain her confidence, and in the mean time,
submit
with patience to that
displeasure
I am
certain I have in a great
measure
deserved
.
Such
sentiments
as
these
, madam, do not
argue
a depravity of heart. Oh! no, my
sweet
Meriel is at this moment as free from guilt as
an angel. Three days are now
elapsed
since
her departure, during which time no
tidings can be gained concerning her. Oh!
Miss
, I fear we
shall
never
see
the dear
creature again:
some
dreadful
mystery
is
certainly concealed by her thus abruptly
leaving her father's
house
. Would to
heaven
I had the means of clearing it up, and
at the
same
time removing the cloud which
at
present
obscures
the reputation of the
most
innocent young lady that ever
existed
. I
will not
finish
this letter till to-morrow. If
we hear no tidings then, I
shall
give her up
as
lost
forever.
July
25
th
.
I
just
snatch
up my pen to inform you,
dear
Miss
, that
Miss
Howard is found, and
is at
present
in her father's
house
; but in
such
a
situation
that we have little hope of
her ever recovering her
senses
sufficient
to
give any regular account of the
cause
of her
flight, of this we are certain,
she
was not
with Mr. Pringle.
July
28
th
.
I am now
sitting
by my poor young lady's
bed
side
, who is
just
fallen into a
sweet
refreshing
sleep
, and
shall
seize
this
opportunity
to inform you, in what manner
she
was
discovered
and conducted home. A farmer
who lives about five miles from hence, at the
skirt
of a wood, having
occasion
for his
horse
to be brought from
pasture
early in the
morning, ordered a lad who lived as a
servant
with him, to go by four o'clock and
fetch it: the lad's way lay thro' the wood, and
when he returned he declared he had been
frightened
almost
to death by an apparition
of a woman,
dressed
all in white, whom he
saw
sitting
at the foot of a tree as he went; that
he heard her
sigh
and groan, and
said
he
supposed
it was the
spirit
of Fanny Summers,
who hung
herself
there
last
autumn, and he
was the more
positive
of this, as at his return,
he
saw
her walking too and fro with a child
in her arms and heard her talk to it. The
farmer laughed at the lad's tale, and rode
away without paying any farther attention to
it, but a young gentleman who has a
lodgings
at the farmers, on account of an ill
state
of health, having over heard the boy's
story
,
determined to
rise
immediately and go to the
wood to
investigate
the matter farther, as
he
supposed
it might be
some
unfortunate
human creature, rather than a
supernatural
being; and determined, if in his power,
to
rescue
her from
misery
, and, what
appeared
more than probable, a horrid and
untimely
end. He had not penetrated far into
the wood before he
discovered
, at the foot of
an old oak, a female form
stretched
on the
ground, and by her
side
a little
spaniel
,
whose
head lay on the woman's arm, and who at
frequent intervals
seemed
to make
most
pitious
moans. He approached and found the
unfortunate female was in a fit, he gently
raised
her from the ground,
supporting
her in
his arms
whilst
he
whilst
her temples with
Vol. I. G
volatiles, which, on account of his own weak
constitution
, he always carried in his pocket.
While he was thus employed, the dog
fawned
upon him licked his hand and
shewed
every token of gratitude in his power; at
length the lady began to move, and her
preserver
hearing the voices of labourers
passing
through the wood, hallowed to them for
assistance
.
When they came near, the dog flew
from his
mistress
to one of them, leaping,
bounding and howling for joy. What
Lubin
,
said
the clown, how come you here,
then drawing nearer to help
support
the
lady; he
started
back and cried, body
o'me, 'tis
Miss
Meriel, poor dear
soul
, how
could
she
get here, as
sure
as any thing
she
has been robbed and murdered.
Almost
smiling
at the fellow's
stupidity
, the young
gentleman bid him
cease
his wonder and
assist
in bearing her to the farm which was the
nearest
house
. The dear creaure never
spoke
during the whole time, indeed
she
seemed
totally incapable of uttering a word, when
they got her to the
house
she
drank a few
spoonfulls
of milk, which
somewhat
revived
her, but her voice was
still
so
weak they
were unable to
distinguish
what
she
said
, and
her eyes too plainly indicated that her mind
was
disturbed
, the good woman of the
house
had her put immediately to bed, and
Isaac
the labourer came home to let his
master
and
mistress
know were their daughter was.
When he told the melancholy tale, Mrs.
Howard
clasped
her hands and cried, my
child deprived of her
senses
!
she
had not
time for more, for Mr. Howard had fallen
on the floor in a fit. I cannot account for
this violent emotion in a man, who had
never
shewn
any great degree of
tenderness
towards his child, but I think I never
saw
the
fondest
parent more affected.
When the family became tolerably
composed
,
it was
proposed
that I
should
take a
chaise
and proceed to the farm, when if
Miss
Howard was able to bear the motion of the
carriage, I was to conduct her home; if
not, to remain with her; and her mother
would come to her in the morning. When
I arrived at the farm, and was
shewn
into the
room where my dear young lady was; my
agitation was
so
great I thought I
should
have died;
she
had on being
first
put to bed
fallen into a little doze, but
soon
started
and
awoke in great terror, and finding
herself
undressed
,
screamed
out, oh heavens! I
am betrayed, I am
lost
, he is here; I know
he is here, and I will not
stay
another
moment
.
She then
insisted
on being
dressed
.
The neighbouring apothecary had been
previously
sent
for; he felt her
pulse
and
declared
that the
disorder
lay entirely on her
spirits
; that every nerve
seemed
convulsed
,
and
she
also
appeared to be greatly
weakened
for want of proper
sustenance
. She was
prevailed on to eat a bit of bread, and drink
a little weak wine and water; after which
she
became a little more
composed
, and
had
sunk
into a profound
sleep
on the
side
of the bed. In this
situation
I found her;
the faithful Lubin laying on a chair that
stood
by the bed
side
, his head
stretched
out
to the pillow of his
mistress
, whom he had
not quitted for a moment
since
her entrance
into the
house
. This dog had been
missing
ever
since
Miss
Howard's
absence
, but our
minds had been occupied by thoughts of
so
much more
distressing
a nature that Lubin
was hardly remembered; he was greatly
attached
to her from her
first
return, and
she
remarkably fond of him. I
sat
down
silently
on the
side
of the bed, and looked at her
dear countenance which
so
lately wore the
bloom of youth and the
smile
of innocent
chearfulness
: alas! how changed, deadly
pale where her cheeks and lips, and only
that I percieved
she
breathed, I
should
have
thought
she
was no longer an inhabitant of
this world; my tears flowed plentifully.
Her
sleep
, tho' apparantly found, was not of
long continuance;
she
shrieked
, awoke, and
immediately
started
off the bed; I caught her
hand,
she
turned
hastily
round. Oh! it is
you Deborah, is it, well now we will go. If
you will accompany me,
say
so
at once, if not
I
must
go without you; for I cannot
stay
here another moment. But where is he
now, looking wildly round her, Who
are you talking of my dear,
said
I,
tenderly
.
Ah! there is the thing now, I thought
you would want to know his name, but I
cannot tell you
nurse
,
so
do not
ask
me; I
have made a vow, a
solemn
sacred
vow,
never
to wound the peace of my dear, adored,
mother. But my dear creature you have
almost
broken her heart by thus flying from
her protection and your father. Father,
said
she
, have I a father? Oh! that I
had never been born. She then began to
rave in a
most
incoherent manner, and
declared
she
would not
stay
another moment
in the
house
. I took this opportunity with
the
permission
of the apothecary to convey
her home: when the
chaise
stopped
at the
door
she
looked out, and clapping her hand
to her forehead, cried yes I
see
how it is,
well, well, it will not be long before I am
released
, and till then, I
must
be patient. I
assisted
her in alighting,
she
leaned on my
arm and walked
slowly
into the
house
; Mrs.
Howard was
so
overcome
she
was unable
to
rise
from her
seat
. Meriel looked for
a moment at her attentively, then
shaking
her head in a
most
sorrowful
manner,
she
G 2
cried, oh! I
see
I have afflicted you, but, alas!
my own heart is overwhelmed with
sorrow
;
and then when I think for a moment, there
are
some
remembrances which
must
be ever
buried in my heart, that torture me
so
, my
brain
seems
on fire. Mrs. Howard
attempted
to
speak
, but unequal to the
task
,
she
clasped
her hands in an agony, and
sobbed
aloud: Meriel
sunk
on her knees before
her, took both her hands, put them
first
to
her head and then to her heart; and
breathing
a deep
sigh
, fell
lifeless
on the floor. We
had her immediately conveyed to bed, where
she
soon
recovered; but a violent fever
come on, and
she
continued raving all night.
Mr. Howard has not yet
seen
her, he
says
if
the girl's
spirits
are in
such
perturbation, the
sight
of him, whom
she
must
be
conscious
she
has offended, would only irritate them
more, when
she
is better I will
see
her,
said
he, and forgive her, that will calm and
comfort
her.
A
physician
was
sent
for; he
said
quiet
and
tenderness
from
those
about her are the
chief things
requisite
to
restore
her. In the
mean time, my dear madam,
said
he, I will
send
her a
composing
draught; if when
she
recovers the
use
of her
reason
, you can
prevail
with her to unburthen her mind, which,
I am certain labours with
some
painful
secret
,
it would greatly
assist
and
hasten
her
recovery.
Thus far, my dear
Miss
, have I given you
an account of this
mysterious
affair. What
to think of her
sudden
departure, and being
found in
such
a
shocking
situation
, we are
all totally at a
loss
. It appears
she
has been
terrified and extremely ill
used
by
somebody
;
but even in the
most
violent
paroxisms
of
her delirium,
she
has never mentioned his
name. I have one thought that haunts me
continually; but that is
so
horrible I dare
not commit it to paper. Indeed, it is too
dreadful, too
shocking
to human nature, to
wear even the face of probability.
The medicines
prescribed
have taken the
desired
effect, and
she
has been in a
composed
sleep
above three hours. I will not conclude
till I can inform you how
she
appears on
awaking, as I know your affection for her
will make you extremely anxious.
She awoke tolerably calm,
instantly
recollected
where
she
was, but did not
seem
to
retain any idea of the late unhappy events.
It is late,
nurse
,
said
she
,
addressing
herself
to me is it not time to get up, then
pausing
a moment, I have had
such
a
horrid
dream. Oh! I would not
pass
such
another
night:
she
then attempted to
rise
;
but finding
herself
extremely weak,
she
continued
,
what is the matter; have I been
ill? Yes, my love,
said
I, you have
been very ill, and are far from well now.
Then perhaps it was not a dream,
said
she
,
putting her hand to her forehead, as if
trying
to recollect;
she
was
silent
for a few
moments
,
then caught hold my hand, and
bursting
into tears,
she
cried, alas! it was
all a reality.
I did not attempt to
stop
her tears, as I
thought they would relieve her. She
asked
for her mother;
seemed
pleased
to
see
her, but
was too weak to talk much. The
physician
has
just
seen
her, and declares her in a fair
way to do well. I hope,
Miss
, you will
excuse
all errors in this long letter, as I
thought you would be anxious to know
all the particulars, I have dwelt on the
subject
more than perhaps was
necessary
, but
will now no longer intrude.
I am, dear
Miss
,
Your very humble
servant
,
DEBORAH ELLIS.
LETTER VIII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Woodbine Cot
,
Sept.
10
th
, 1775.
Once
more, my beloved Celia, I am
permitted to
address
you; but I will
not
address
you in the voice of complaint,
because
I might have been far more
wretched
than I am. Much gratitude is therefore
due to that benignant power, who has
protected
me through many dangers, and
saved
me from an evil which I could hardly have
endured and lived. My
senses
too are
restored
,
my life
preserved
by
almost
a
miracle
;
and
shall
I,
surrounded
by
these
marvelous
blessings
, dare to repine
because
I do not
enjoy that tranquility of heart which young
women of my age and fortune in general
possess
.
I do not repine; I
submit
to the
chastening
hand of heaven, I hope with that
patience
,
which is the
Christian
's duty. I do
not even
presume
to enquire, why
these
things are permitted; but yet my heart bleeds
with my recent afflictions, and would fain
seek
ease
by pouring forth its
sorrows
to that
dear friendly girl, who will pity and
sooth
them. You
must
, long ere this, have
received
Deborah's letter, which has no doubt
filled you with amazement. It is my
sad
task
to explain to you the
mystery
that
invelopes
my conduct. To no other
person
breathing will I unfold my labouring heart:
no, not even to kind hearted Deborah, or my
my dear
suffering
mother: but to you, Celia,
to you
whose
thoughts are detached from
the world, to you who will
consider
this
confidence
as
sacred
: to you I will venture to
disclose
a
scene
, the remembrance of which,
even at this moment, chills the vital tide that
nourishes
my heart. But you, my gentle
friend, well I know, tho'
struck
with horror
at the tale I
shall
unfold, will join with me
in offering to the throne of grace, fervent
prayers for the author of my
sorrows
. Oh
thou Father, creator of the
universe
, look
down upon him, pardon his manifold
offences
,
touch his heart that he may
see
his
errors, and oh! of thy infinite mercy, blot
this
last
transgression
from the book of life.
This is my daily prayerbut to proceed in
my
sad
task
:
The day my mother went into Effex I
felt my
spirits
unusually
oppressed
, I rode
out in the afternoon with my father, he
was extremely gay in his
conversation
,
indeed
,
I thought too much
so
, as he treated
some
subjects
with a levity which greatly
shocked
me, and
some
expressions
escaped
him which wounded my delicacy, but this
did not
so
much
surprise
me as he had
frequently
indulged
himself
in very improper
conversation
, not only before me, but other
young women, who
visited
at the
house
, for
which my mother always reproved him, but
he in general turned it off with a laugh.
However, as I had no
person
with me in the
chaise
, his manner was extremely
embarassing
,
nay even
distressing
, for he
saluted
me
several
times, told me he was afraid of
shewing
much affection to me before my mother,
who in her heart hates me; but, that if I
was a good girl, he would not care for my
mother, but
shew
me every
kindness
in his
power; that I
should
go where I
pleased
, and
do whatever my inclinations led me to.
Astonished
at this
conversation
, I hardly knew
what to
answer
, and was extremely glad
when we got home. I would have retired
immediately to my appartment, but he
insisted
on my
staying
to
sup
with him,
saying
he had ordered a chicken on
purpose
for me.
I reluctantly complied. During
supper
he
drank very freely and would have had me
drink
several
glasses
of wine; which as I was
unaccustomed
to I
resolutely
refused
. When
I had
supped
he would have me play him a
tune, after which he
sung
a
song
more
adapted
to the
taste
of a libertine than the
chaste
ears of a daughter. At ten o'clock I retired,
and, tho' greatly
surprized
at my father's
conduct
,
yet having nothing particularly heavy
on my mind, I
soon
fell
asleep
, I never had
been
used
to lock my door, and you may
imagine my terror when being awoke by a
noise
in the room, I felt a man's hand take
hold of mine; I gave a faint
scream
, fright
deprived me of much power, but how were
my fears
increased
, when I heard my father
say
,
hush
! don't make a
noise
, it is only
me. You,
sir
, I replied,
starting
up,
and what can be the
cause
of your coming
here. I cannot remember his
answer
, Celia,
but I know he caught me in his arms. I
sprang
from him with a violent effort, and
quitting the bed, the
darkness
of the night
befriended me and I
rushed
out of the room
into Deborah's chamber. After this I kept
my apartment for
several
days, nor did I
intend to have left it again till my mother's
return, pretending
indisposition
; but he
wrote me a letter, in which he
asserted
that
he had
mistaken
my chamber for the
housemaid's
,
with whom he
confessed
he had an
intrigue. Oh Celia! what a humaliating
confession
from a father to a child,
sure
none but
an unprincipled rake could have brought
himself
to make it. He begged I would not
mention the
circumstance
to my mother, and
promised
amendment in future. Alas! I
was deceived by this letter and again
ventured
down to my meals. The day Deborah
had leave to go out I
spent
the chief part
below
,
he was remarkably
reserved
in his
behaviour
,
and
seemed
even indifferent and
inattentive to me,
scarcely
speaking
the whole
day. At
supper
I drank as
usual
one
glass
of wine and then retired; I felt an
unaccountable
drowsiness
come over me; but it had
been a
storm
all the evening, and the
almost
incessant
flashes
of lightning, with
distant
rumbling thunder, prevented my indulging
it. I had partly
undressed
myself
and was
sitting
on the
side
of the bed endeavouring
to
compose
myself
, (for I am greatly
terrified
at lightning,) when the door opened,
and my father entered; he immediately
shut
the door and turned the key. To
describe
my horror is
impossible
, or to give you the
most
distant
idea of the
scene
that
ensued
;
but never to the
latest
hour I have to breathe,
will it be
erased
from my memory. My
repeated
screams
were of no avail. Deborah
was from home, and the other maids
slept
too
far off to hear me. Oh! how often did I
wish
that the vivid lightning, which every
moment illumined the room, would
strike
me dead. At length a
most
tremendous clap
Vol. I. H
of thunder
burst
as it were directly over us.
It ennerved, even the arm of hardened guilt,
but it encouraged me. I
seized
the
opportunity
to fling open the window and declare,
if he did not
instantly
quit my chamber, I
would throw
myself
out, and
seeing
a
penknife
lay on the window
seat
, I
snatched
it
up: come not near me,
sir
,
said
I,
for the moment you lay your hand upon
me, this
shall
put an end to your
existence
.
my fury which had wrought me
almost
to a
state
of frenzy, intimidated him. Be
patient
,
Meriel,
said
he,
shut
the window and
get into bed, you will catch your death with
cold. Better be dead,
said
I, than
live with
dishonour
. I
swear
, he replied,
by all that is
sacred
, if you will go quietly
to bed I will quit the room immediately.
You
shall
quit it
instantly
,
said
I, in a
menacing accent; am I not your child,
and do you dare invade the virtue it is
your duty to protect? Celia, I felt at that
moment as tho' I could have encountered
almost
any thing; that I could have bared
my
bosom
to the
stroke
of death, and even
met the blow with
thankfulness
; he
saw
my
increasing
frenzy, and trembling unlocked
the door and left the room. The moment
he was gone I locked
myself
in, and
overcome
with horror and
distress
, fell
almost
lifeless
on the bed: how long I continued in
this
state
of torpor I cannot tell; but the
first
use
I made of my returning
senses
was
to think of
escaping
from the
house
, and in
this I was
resolutely
determined, when I
heard him again at the door demanding
admission
:
the candle was now gone out, and
the window
still
open; the thought was
momentary
:
I formed no plan for
support
, nor
even thought of a place where to
seek
an
asylum
; but,
starting
up, I pulled the
sheets
off the bed, and,
undressed
as I was,
slipped
by them into the garden. How I
escaped
,
unhurt, heaven alone can tell: the
moment I felt
myself
on the ground I
thanked
God for my deliverance, and going out
of the back garden gate, ran as
fast
as my
strength
would permit, as I imagined,
toward
a neighbouring village; but as the
day began to dawn, I found I had taken a
wrong road, and was at the entrance of a
large wood; I was afraid to return,
lest
I
should
meet my father; therefore, forcing
my way into the
thickest
part, I found a
little hovel, which had been made by
some
unfortunate wanderer, of branches and dry
leaves: into this poor
shelter
I crept, and
here
first
discovered
that my faithful Lubin
was with me. The little affectionate animal
crept
close
up to me, licking my hands and
face, as tho' he
wished
to comfort me; in
this
situation
, my cloaths wet, my
spirits
harrassed
, and nature overcome, I
sunk
into
a
slumber
. But here I
must
drop my pen,
for memory no longer bears any traces of
the
ensuing
scenes
, till I awoke in my own
bed and
saw
Deborah weeping by my
side
.
Farewell, I will write again
soon
.
MERIEL.
LETTER IX.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Woodbine Cot
,
Sept. 20th
, 1775.
My
lot is hard, Celia, very hard; but
I endeavour to keep up my
spirits
, as
well as I am able, and conduct
myself
in
such
a manner as my own heart may acquit me.
When I was quite recovered from my
illness
,
my mother called me one day into her
dressing
-room and
assured
me,
she
would
pardon
my elopement, on condition I would
inform
her of the
cause
, and by what means
I came in the
shocking
situation
already
described
.
You may be certain I felt
myself
greatly agitated, as I knew I could not give
this dear parent the
satisfaction
she
required,
without planting a dagger in her heart.
Indeed
,
my friend, I cannot but feel thankful,
that in my frenzy I did not
discover
the whole
horrid
secret
, as it would have only
involved
us all in much greater
distress
than we
experience at
present
.
I remained
silent
to my mother's
question
,
but could not
restrain
my tears. She
repeated
it; conjuring me, in the
most
solemn
manner, not to trifle with her, but to tell
her what urged me to
desert
my home and
friends.
Oh! my dear mother,
said
I, do
not
ask
, indeed I cannot tell you. Suffer me
to be
silent
on this
subject
; and, in every
future
action of my life, I will implicitly obey
you. I fear, Meriel,
said
my mother,
you have
some
unworthy
reasons
for this
concealment: tell me, then, who
advised
you
to this imprudent
step
, and who accompanied
you in your flight? No one,
said
I,
the
resolution
was
hastily
formed, and as
hastily
H 2
executed; but I had no
adviser
, no
companion
,
nor do I think I ever went farther
than the wood, where I was
discovered
.
Meriel! Meriel!
said
my mother, I
cannot believe you. It appears altogether
improbable, that a young woman, without
any apparent
cause
,
should
form a
hasty
resolution
of running away; that
she
should
chuse
a
tempestuous
night to make her
escape
, without a companion, and hide
herself
in a wood with a
design
to
starve
herself
to
death. Tell me, child, and tell me
sincerely
,
did you not once love Pringle? I
thought I did, but it was a
mistake
of the
heart.
I fear, Meriel, that
mistake
has led to
your ruin: he certainly accompanied you in
your flight, and my child is
lost
to honour
and to virtue. Is not this the
cause
of your
obstinate
silence
: do you not fear that the
villain, whom in your heart you
still
love,
should
be brought to
answer
for his
inhuman
desertion
of you.
Oh! no my dear mother,
said
I,
redoubling
my tears, indeed you wrong me,
I never entertained a thought that I
should
blush
to own, and if it was my
last
moment,
I could, with
safety
to my
conscience
,
declare
that neither Mr. Pringle, nor any of
his family knew of my going away.
Strange infatuation,
said
she
, angrily,
to
assert
such
falsehoods
. Oh Meriel! I
had hoped better from you; but I am
sorry
to
say
, in this
instance
, I can place no
confidence
in your veracity. Here my father
entered the room, and would you believe it
possible
, Celia, he repeated to me every
question
which my mother had
asked
before.
Astonishment
riveted my tongue. I could not
answer
. My
silence
was accounted
obstinacy
,
and my dear mother left me with
these
cruel words:
Dissembling
,
obstinate
girl,
I can never love you as I once did, though I
will
strive
to forgive you.
My father
scarcely
now ever
speaks
to me,
and
seems
in his heart to hate me, as he
takes every opportunity in his power of
mortifying me;
construes
my
most
innocent
actions into faults, and is continually
complaining
to my mother of my indolence, and
sulkiness
, as he inhumanely terms that want
of vivacity, for which he
so
well knows how
to account. This ill humour I could bear
patiently, but my mother's
unkindness
is
worse
than a dagger to my heart. I live in
greater
solitude
than ever; I never go out,
and when any company comes to the family,
I in general retire to my own room; for my
feelings are often hurt by the ignorant, I
had
almost
said
inhuman
questions
, that are
asked
me by people who have no other
interest
in my fate, than as it
serves
to gratify
their
curiosity
. Next week I expect my
brother
home from
school
; he does not return
again, but is to be articled apprentice to a
merchant in London. I
shall
not be
sorry
when he is gone, for I expect to
suffer
greatly
from his unfeeling taunts. Oh! Celia,
heaven and you know how little I
deserve
them; and that thought
shall
be my comfort
and
support
. Adieu my friend.
MERIEL.
LETTER X.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
December
19
th
, 1775.
You
are, no doubt
surprized
to
see
from whence this letter is dated, and
you will be much more
so
, when I inform
you of the great change that has taken place
in our
circumstances
,
some
little time after
I
last
wrote to you, as I was
sitting
in my
own room, indulging the
most
painful ideas,
I heard a great
confusion
below, and, among
the
rest
, my mother's voice repeatedly
screaming
for help. I ran down
stairs
into
the parlour, from whence the
noise
proceeded
,
and on entering
saw
two ill looking men,
one of which had
seized
my father by the
collar, and the other was
assisting
to drag
him away. What is the matter,
said
I,
to the men, what are you doing with my
father? Oh! we will do him no harm,
said
one of them; he
must
only come away
with us to my
house
, at Litchfield, till he has
paid five hundred pounds. Five
hundred
pounds,
said
I, why, dear madam,
turning to my mother, to whom does my
father owe
so
much money. Oh child!
said
he, your mother knows nothing
about the affair, I not only owe that, but
three times the
sum
; we are inevitably
ruined
,
and all by my own folly. I have been
bound for a friend of mine, a young man, at
Litchfield, who is gone off, and I
shall
have
all his debts to
discharge
. My poor mother
sat
weeping; and, on hearing this account,
lifted up her eyes in
speechless
agony. I
could not bear to
see
her
distress
. It is a
large
sum
to be
sure
gentlemen,
said
I, but
it
shall
be paid,
so
let my father remain, and
do you go away for to night; to-morrow we
will
send
you the money. Alas! Celia,
how very little I knew of the world. The
inhuman men laughed at me, and
asked
me,
when I ever heard of bailiffs letting go
their
prisoner
on the bare word of a girl.
If you will not take my word,
said
I,
leave my fahter and take me, for it will
break my dear mother's heart to have him
carried to
prison
; but, as to me, it matters
not what becomes of me. That won't
do neither,
Miss
,
said
they, we
must
either have the money or take the
gentleman
away. Alas!
said
I, turning to my
mother, what can I do? they will not
release
him. No my child,
said
my mother,
with more affection in her voice than I had
heard for
some
time, we
must
submit
as
patiently as we can till to-morrow, and then
see
what can be done. My father went
away
cursing
his evil genius. Why will
people
,
Celia, when they bring misfortune on
their own heads, rail at fate; yet you will
find it always the
case
, and the more
egregrious
have been their errors, the more
vehement
their compalints.
When they were gone, I exerted
myself
to
console
my mother, but her only
answer
was, Ah Meriel! what will become of us,
I
see
ruin approaching; I know of no way
to avoide it, and my poor boy, what will he
do. Let me intreat you my dear
mother
,
said
I, not to let this accident thus
distress
you: can you
suppose
, that while I
have the means of living in
ease
and comfort,
I would
suffer
my parent or my brother to
feel any
embarrassment
, which it is in my
power
to remove. Did I not
solemnly
promise
the dear departed
saint
, who made me thus
independant, never to
forsake
you?
But alas! Meriel, have you not already
broke that vow? Dear, dear madam,
forgive
,
forget, that involuntary
transgression
;
and believe me, there never was a heart that
glowed with more filial love, or greatful
tenderness
,
than mine does towards you. My
fortune is your's, I will
share
it with you and
my brother to the
last
shilling
; nay to
convince
you of my
sincerity
, I would freely
renounce
it all, and depend on my labour for
support
. My mother was affected, but it
was only for a moment,
she
again
assumed
a
look of
coldness
, and told me
she
feared I
often
suffered
the warmth of my
imagination
to hurry me into
expressions
and
promises
,
the nature of which I did not duly
consider
. She then bid me good night and
left me.
Grieved to be thought
so
very
unworthy
,
by the
person
on earth I
most
loved,
most
wished
to
see
happy, I could take no
rest
all night. As
soon
as day-light
appeared
I
arose
, and
dressing
myself
as plain as
possible
, borrowing a black bonnet of
Deborah
,
I determined to
set
out for Litchfield
on foot; but, fearing my mother might be
alarmed at my
absence
, I left a note
informing
her, in a few words, that I was gone to
endeavour to prove
myself
worthy of her
love. During my walk I revolved in my
mind what
steps
to
pursue
. Mr. Sutten was
joint guardian with my father: I had no
doubt he had been
sent
for on account of
the
arrest
, and hoped to prevail on him to
advance
sufficient
money to make my poor
mother
easy
in her mind. I therefore
determined
to go immediately to the
house
of the
bailiff, and learn at
whose
suit
my father had
been
arrested
. From thence I would go to
the creditor and endeavour to prevail with
him to take half the money now, and the
rest
when I became my own
mistress
, which,
according to Mrs. Mirvan's will, was to be at
eighteen years old. Here
busy
reflection
arose
, and told me how very unworthy of
my attention my father was, but he is my
father
still
,
said
I, and tho' he has forgotten
his duty towards me, it does not follow that
I am to neglect mine to him:
besides
,
religion
teaches us to reward evil with good;
and
surely
, if there is any way of awakening
the
person
who injures us, to a
sense
of their
guilt, it is by
shewing
them an example of
christian
charity, and good will;
besides
,
my mother and brother have not injured me,
and why
should
they
suffer
for the vices of
my father? Occupied by
these
reflections, I
entered Litchfield, and went directly to the
bailiff's
house
. My father was not up;
indeed
I did not
wish
to
see
him if he had,
so
I
only made the
necessary
enquiries, learnt
who the creditor was, and proceeded
directly
to the
street
where he lived. Mr.
Leeson
is a man, who, for many years,
served
a
nobleman
in London, as I have been told, tho'
Vol. I. I
in what capacity, I never heard. In his
service
,
he accumulated a
considerable
fortune,
and married a lady, a particular
friend
of his
lordship
's. Soon after he procured a
pension
,
with which he came down to Litchfield,
the place of his lady's birth, where he is now
reckoned a very great man. This was the
person
who had
occasioned
my father's
imprisonment
.
On knocking at the door a
servant
appeared yawning, and examining my
dress
with a
scrutinizing
eye,
asked
what I wanted.
I
wish
too
see
Mr.
Leeson
,
said
I, on
particular
business
. Humph,
said
the
fellow,
standing
with his back
against
the
wall, his hands in his breeches pockets,
you
must
wait a good while before you
can
see
him, for he is not up yet. Pray
friend,
said
I, give me leave to go in and
sit
down till your
master
does get up. You
may go down
stairs
,
said
he, if you will,
and when
master
is
stirring
, I will let you
know.
Humiliating, as it was, I went down
stairs
,
sat
down by the kitchen fire and dried my
feet, which were wet,
some
rain having
fallen
in the night; my petticoat was
also
plashed
with dirt. About nine o'clock, a
spruce
young woman, in a long white
bedgown
,
came into the kitchen, and looking
at me with a
sort
of contemptuous
sneer
,
cries,
servant
ma'am, pray who may you
want? Imagining, from her appearance,
and the manner in which
she
put the
question
,
that
she
might be
some
relation of
the family, I
rose
from my
seat
, and
answered
I had
business
of much importance
with Mr.
Leeson
. Aye Mrs. Bridget,
cried a footman, who was cleaning
some
silver
candlesticks
, at the
dresser
; when my
lady's bell rings, you
must
let
master
know,
this here young body has been waiting here
ever
since
eight o'clock. A young
lass
, in
appearance a menial
servant
, now appeared,
and
spreading
a fine napkin on the table,
brought the
breakfast
things,
toasted
some
oat cakes, and Mrs. Bridget and Mr. James
sat
very comfortably down to
breakfast
; but
during their
repast
, neither
asked
me if I would
partake, tho' they endeavoured to gratify
their
curiosity
, by
asking
, how far I had
walked, if I had been long in the country,
and many other
questions
, equally
impertinent
and
insignificant
; to all which I
answered
in little more than
monosyllables
.
At length the bell rang, and Mrs. Bridget
making a
hasty
finish
of her
breakfast
, ran
up
stairs
:
soon
after, the footman having
equip'd
himself
as a valet, went out of the
kitchen. I was now once more left to
myself
,
but had not indulged reflection long,
before the girl, who had prepared the
breakfast
,
came and
sat
down, in order to eat her
own. She pour'd out two cups of tea, got
up and held the oat cake (which was
almost
cold) to the fire, then
casting
a look,
first
at me, then at the table, in a mild accent,
as tho' fearful of giving offence,
said
, I am
afraid you have not
breakfasted
ma'am;
pray eat a bit, and take this cup of tea,
hoiding the plate and tea towards me.
Mrs. Bridget is very proud ma'am, and
Mr. James does nothing but what he thinks
she
will like; but I thinks your London
folks are all proud; they
serves
only to
make places uncomfortable. Do ma'am take
it; I
wish
it was hotter and better. It is
very good,
said
I, taking a bit; for the
poor girl's
goodness
of heart was
so
conspicuous
that I could not mortify her by a
refusal
.
She
smiled
, began drinking her own
tea, and continued: Mr. James was quite
a different
sort
of a body, I
assures
you ma'am
before he went to London
last
summer
with
my
mistress
; dear heart, he and I were
so
comfortable and happy, but when they
came home my lady brought Mrs. Bridget
with her, and ever
since
She
paused
; I
saw
her eyes
glisten
. Poor girl, thought I,
James is
false
hearted, he has
forsaken
thee
for Bridget; and yet, if he had but
discernment
to perceive the difference between the
two hearts, how gladly would he return to
one
so
gentle and tender. Here I was
interrupted
by Mr. James
himself
, who told
me his
master
desired
me to walk up. I
bade the kind hearted girl good morning,
and followed James into the
presence
of his
master
.
Well, young woman,
said
Mr.
Leeson
,
who was
standing
with his back to the
sire
, and his hands behind him. (Celia I
must
here
digress
to give you
some
small
idea of his
person
and manner.) A
person
rather above the middle
size
, a face, the
features
of which, might have been termed
regular
,
and even
pleasing
, had benevolence,
good humour or
politeness
been any way
discernable
in it,
instead
of which there was
an
insolent
pertness
, a
supercilious
,
self-approving
smile
, that to my idea portrayed
nothing but ignorance, pride and conceit.
Well, young woman,
said
he, what
may be your commands with me.
You are
sir
, I
understand
, the
person
who has
caused
Mr. Howard to be
arrested
.
He
answered
in the
assirmative
.
I waited on you,
sir
, to make
some
proposal
concerning this affair, in hopes of
being
the means of his obtaining his liberty.
I 2
What, do you belong to Mrs.
Belmour
?
Belong to who
sir
? in an accent of
surprize
.
To Mrs. Belmour; the woman for
whom Howard has thus involved
himself
.
I
understood
,
sir
, that he was bound
for a friend.
Well child,
she
was his friend, my
friend, any body's friend: why
sure
you
know her.
Indeed,
sir
, I never heard of her
before
:
I am Mr. Howards daughter.
Bless
my
soul
! Mr. Howard's
daughter
,
are you; well I have often heard of
you, tho' I never had the
pleasure
of
seeing
you before. I remember hearing of that
strange
affair of your running away after
Ensign
Pringle, and when he
refused
to have
any thing to
say
to you, being afraid to
go home again, you hid
yourself
in a wood,
and went out of your
senses
.
Celia, can you for a moment
suppose
what, at that
instant
, were my feelings;
unable
any longer to
support
myself
I
sunk
into
the
nearest
chair, (for I had been kept
standing
) and
burst
into tears.
'Pon honour,
Miss
,
said
he, I beg
pardon, I did not mean to make you
uneasy
;
but when one hears
such
strange
stories
, one
likes, you know, to come at the truth: 'pon
my
soul
I
wish
I had been in Pringles place,
I
should
not have driven
such
a pretty little
kind
soul
to
dispair
.
During this
speech
he had drawn nearer
to me and had taken one of my hands, which
I drew from him with
disdain
. Sir,
said
I, with as much
composure
as I could
assume
,
you have been totally
misinformed
about
that unhappy affair; and, pardon me, if I
say
, that it can be no
business
of your's, to
enquire, what were the motives of a conduct,
which, I find, has
cast
a fatal
shade
upon my
reputation; I do not think
myself
accountable
for my actions, to you or any other
indifferent
person
: it is
sufficient
that heaven
and my own heart acquits me of evil. I
came here, Mr.
Leeson
, to
consult
about
the liberation of my father; let me know
on what terms that can be obtained, and I
am ready to comply with them.
He cannot be liberated
Miss
,
said
he,
without the debts being
discharged
, and
costs
of
suit
being paid. Well,
sir
, and
to how much does that amount.
To five hundred and twenty pounds.
Well,
sir
, if I pay you three hundred
now, and bind
myself
by the
most
solemn
engagement to pay the other when I am
eighteen, will you
set
Mr. Howard at
liberty
.
There is the
interest
of the money,
Miss
, and then the hazard, this money
being
all advanced out of my own pocket,
Miss
, and you are only a minor you know.
I
sind
,
sir
,
said
I,
rising
from my
seat
,
that I am totally
unsit
to talk on
these
matters
,
being but little acquainted with the
world, or what is daily acting in it; I will
therefore take my leave, for the
present
,
and return in about two hours with Mr.
Sutten, my guardian, who will better
understand
how to
settle
the affair.
I now returned to the bailiff's
house
,
where I learnt Mr. Sutten was with my
father
.
I
desired
that he might be informed I
was there, and
wished
to
speak
with him; but
I
must
give you the
result
of our
conversation
in my next, as I have many things to attend
to
besides
writing to my Celia. Ah! my
dear girl, times are
strangely
altered, but, I
thank heaven, I have health and more
spirits
than could be well expected after the painful
scenes
I have gone through; but no doubt
I may have many more trials yet to endure.
Pray for me, my friend, that I may have
strength
of mind to bear them as I ought,
so
as not to
disgrace
the religion of which
I am a
professor
; and be
assured
, that every
kind
wish
of my heart is daily offered up
for your felicity; and that the remembrance
of the happy, happy hours we have
spent
together, is ever
present
to the mind of
your
MERIEL.
LETTER XI.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
January
3
d
, 1776.
I have
not had a moment to devote to
my dear Celia
since
I
dispatched
the
last
,
but as I know your friendly heart
shares
all
the
sufferings
of your Meriel, I will now
continue
my narrative.
When Mr. Sutten appeared, he was
greatly
surprised
to
see
me at Litchfield, and when
I told him of my
visit
to Mr.
Leeson
, he
appeared
very angry and
said
, with his good
will, I
should
not pay a farthing, and at any
rate I
should
not have the money, till I was
of age; for I might, if I attempted to
extricate
my father from his
present
difficulites,
soon
be reduced to beggary, and leave
myself
without the power of
assisting
my
mother
;
who was far more
deserving
my
affection
and duty.
It is on her account,
sir
,
said
I, that
I am thus anxious. Her
happiness
is bound
up with my father's, and while he is under
confinement
she
will be
miserable
;
besides
,
Mr. Sutten,
she
does not think I love her,
does not think me capable of doing a
worthy
action. Oh!
sir
, give me the power to
convince her, that my own
interest
and
happiness
is of little value when put in
competition
with her's.
My dear
miss
Howard,
said
he, you
must
confess
appearances have been
strangely
against
you. I will acknowledge I
myself
have had my doubts concerning the
rectitude
of your heart.
Oh! I know,
said
I, there is a fatal
mystery
involves my conduct, a
mystery
which I never can reveal.
Nor will I
desire
it, replied the humane
Mr. Sutten, I
see
at this moment
such
traits of genuine
goodness
,
such
proofs of
a mind,
impressed
with a
just
sense
of its
duty
,
that I
shall
always think you had
some
very
just
cause
for your
past
conduct, nor will
I believe it
possible
for a heart capable of
conceiving
such
noble,
disinterested
resolutions
,
to harbour inclinations derogatory to the
honour and dignity of a virtuous woman.
I thanked him for his good opinion, and
he proceeded: You
must
consider
,
Miss
Howard, that you are young, very young;
you know but little of the world, of
consequence
can form no
just
value of that
independence
,
which, believe me, can alone
secure
you friends. Beauty and merit, my dear
girl, are oftener a prejudice than a benefit to
the
posessors
; it is an object of envy to your
own
sex
; and,
sorry
I am to add, in general
excites no other ideas in the
bosom
of ours,
than to lead them to endeavour to vitiate
those
principles they pretend to adore; let me
intreat
you, therefore, to
set
a
just
value on that
independence, with which it has
pleased
heaven to
bless
you;
assist
your parents as
far as you can, without hurting
yourself
,
and remember, that to
secure
the
friendship
of others you
must
not need their
assistance
.
This, my dear Celia, was arguing like a
cold
philosopher
, and a man of the world;
but it was not
speaking
with the
spirit
of
christianity
, or with the
enthusiasm
of a
heart that glows with benevolence to all its
fellow creatures. The dear
lessons
which I
imbibed at Bologne taught me to regard
myself
but in a
secondary
light, when any thing
praise
-worthy was to be performed, and to
remember only the precepts of him who
taught us to do as we would be done by;
and, like the good Samaritan, to pour oil
and wine into the wounds of our
suffering
fellow
creatures; but to proceed:
Mr. Sutten
refused
to advance a
shilling
,
and I was forced to return to my mother,
disappointed
, dejected, and weary.
Two days after, an execution was
sent
to
Woodbine Cot; my poor mother and
myself
were obliged to remove to Litchfield,
where we took a
small
lodging near the
house
where my father was, where we remained
till the
estate
was
sold
and all paid away to the
last
farthing, nor was even that enough to
answer
all the demands that were continually
pouring in from all quarters;
besides
, when
the
estate
came to be
sold
, it was found
so
encumbered
with mortgages, &c. that it would
not
sell
for above half its value. When all was
settled
, and my father at liberty, it was
determined
that we
should
set
forward to
London
,
where my father
insisted
we could live
much cheaper than in the country, where
we were
so
well known. There was
still
the
interest
of my four
thousand
pounds,
which as it was at my own
disposal
, I
determined
to devote to the
support
of the family.
All our
servants
were
discharged
, poor
Deborah
too; you cannot think, Celia, what
I
suffered
on being
separated
from this
faithful
Vol. I. K
woman. She offered to
stay
with us
without being paid; but my mother would
not
consent
to reeicve an obligation from an
inferior. I thought the
resolution
savoured
of pride; but we all have our failings, and
perhaps pride in
some
degree, is laudable.
On our arrival in town, we took a
small
lodging and hired a young woman to do the
most
laborious part of our
domestic
business
;
the
rest
it is my province to perform; and,
believe me, I do it chearfully. It employs
my mind, prevents my taking melancholy
retrospects
, and I think contributes to
improve
both my health and
spirits
. We have
paid a
visit
to my father's
eldest
sister
. She
is married to a
counsellor
, who has made a
genteel independence by his
profession
. My
aunt is a woman
whose
character I do not
well know how to develope. She is in
general
affable,
condescending
, and chearful;
and in
conversation
, gives evident proofs of
a genteel education, and a brilliant
understanding
;
but, withall is
so
tinctured with
vanity
,
and tho' upwards of forty,
still
possesses
that
spirit
of coquetry, that in a great
measure
obscures
her good qualities. Her
daughters
,
Hester
and
Susan
, have had, what is
termed a
fashionable
education, that is, they
can daub a fan mount, jumble the keys of
the
harpsichord
, and jabber an unintelligible
jargon, which they call French. They are
realy lovely girls.
Hester
, in particular,
seems
calculated to
inspire
love and
respect
,
wherever
she
appears.
Susan
is more
volatile
,
but, withall can make
herself
extremely
agreeable. They are both
spoilt
by the
mother
,
who, having taken it into her head,
that their beauty will certainly recommend
them to men of rank and fortune, is
continually
filling the poor girls' minds with
that kind of vanity, and eager
desire
of
conquest
,
that in general fails of the
desired
effect, and repels the admiration, which it
is
designed
to attract. Their naturally good
dispositions
are by
these
means totally
preverted
,
and
instead
of being the engaging,
innoecnt, unaffected girls, which nature
form'd them, they appear, in a mixed
company
,
a combination of pride, vanity, and
self
-conceit.
Mr.
Mosop
, their father, is haughty,
distant
,
and forbidding in his manner,
posesses
a great deal, of what is called family pride:
has little feeling and
less
good nature, yet
on the whole is deemed a
respectable
character
.
He is
strictly
honest
in his
principles
,
pays every one their due to the
utmost
farthing, but will not
bestow
the
least
trifle
in charity,
because
he
considers
constantly
paying the poor rate to be a
sufficient
discharge
of that duty. The query with me,
is, whether he would pay that
sum
yearly
if not obliged to it; if not, where is the
merit of paying it now. Oh! Celia, how
do I hate
those
luke-warm hearts. You
may remember I always
shewed
a
dislike
to
the cool doctrines of
philosophy
. I could
never have a good opinion of a
person
who
regards every
surrounding
object with the
stoical
eye of apathy. I am
sure
they
must
possess
hearts, rendered impenetrable by
nature
to
those
fine feelings, which, tho' at
some
moments they may
distress
, in general
elevate
and expand the
soul
. For my own part,
Celia, I am as weak as an infant, whenever
a
scene
of
distress
or
happiness
meets my eye,
I have a tear of
sympathy
for the one, and a
smile
of gratulation for the other; and the
smile
and the tear, mingle
so
sweetly
with
each other, that every faculty is harmonized
by the union, and I am at a
loss
to tell which
sensation
is the
most
exquisitely
delightful.
Then let the unfeeling
boast
the
philosophic
calmness
of their tempers. I will not
scruple
to aver, that tho' they may
escape
many
an acute pang, that wrings the heart of
sensibility
,
they know not what true
pleasure
is.
But I am
strangely
digressing
from my
subject
.
You will wonder perhaps, how I
so
soon
comprehended the character of my
uncle's
family: believe me, Celia, it was not
by my own penetration that I
discovered
them. From my own
observations
, I
should
have
supposed
Mr.
Mossop
an agreeable man,
his wife a charming, amiable woman, and
the two young ladies the
sweetest
,
most
engaging
girls in the world; nay, at this very
moment, I feel
so
inclined to love the whole
family, that I think the
disagreeable
traits in
their characters have been exaggerated. It
was to a Mr. Rainsforth, that I was indebted
for this minute delineation of them. This
Mr. Rainsforth is an agreeable young man,
whom I have frequently
seen
at my uncle's,
and at
first
thought he was partial to my
cousin
Hester
, but I find I was
mistaken
in
this
supposition
, as his intimacy in the family
proceeds from his having been
school
-fellow
with young
Mossop
, whom I have as yet
seen
but little of.
Rainsforth is the
son
of a merchant, in
Plymouth. His mother died when he was
an infant, and his father has, within
these
few years, married a woman many years
younger than
himself
, by whom he has a
young family. Frederic has a
small
fortune
independent of his father, and is
besides
a
lieutenant in the navy. My father
seems
very partial to him; that, you will
say
, is
no great recommendation; but I flatter
myself
,
Celia, this unhappy father begins to
see
K 2
his errors, and will, in future atone for them.
I think, tho' our income is
circumscribed
,
and our
situation
greatly altered, my dear
mother is much happier than I ever
saw
her.
I cannot
boast
of much
happiness
myself
;
remembrance
,
painful rembrance, damps every
little
pleasure
or
amusement
that is offered
to my notice; yet, when I look round me,
and behold many who are perhaps my
superiors
in worth and virtue,
perishing
for want
of the common
necessaries
of life;
oppressed
with
sickness
;
surrounded
with children,
who look up to them for that
support
, which
they have not to
bestow
: when I
see
these
things, my friend, I lift up my heart in
humble
gratitude to that Providence, who has,
thro' life, given a portion into my hand, the
overplus of which may, in
some
little degree,
serve
to cheer the
sons
and daughters of
misery
.
You
smile
to hear me talk of having
any to
spare
from my little income. Oh!
my dear girl, had I but a
shilling
in my
pocket
,
I could not call it my own, if I
saw
a
fellow creature
whose
heart would be in the
least
lightened by
sharing
it with me.
My aunt has
promised
to take me to a play.
I am fond reading dramatic works, and form
great expectations of
amusement
from
seeing
a performance. I will certainly give you
some
account of my entertainment
whenever
I go. Till then, and ever, believe me
affectionately your's.
MERIEL.
LETTER XII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
March
3
d
, 1776.
I never
shall
get
used
to the ways of
London, and I am always bringing
myself
into difficulties, and
foolish
embarrasments
,
through my ignorance; then my
mother is angry, and what in reality
proceeds
from
simplicity
of my nature, is
construed
into art or levity.
I have been fretting
these
two hours
about a
circumstance
that has highly
offended
my dear mother; and, I am
sure
,
Celia, I did it without a thought of harm.
I had been out a little way
yesterday
, and
was returning in the
close
of the evening,
when I heard a very genteel looking elderly
gentleman enquiring the way to a
street
which lay in my way home; the
person
whom he
addressed
could not direct him,
and I,
unconscious
of any impropriety,
stepped
forward and told him, as it lay in my
way, I would
shew
him the place he
enquired
for: he
seemed
much obliged to me, and
said
, as we were going the
same
way I
might as well take hold of his arm; but
this, as he was quite a
stranger
, I
refused
to
do; however, I could not help
answering
some
civil
questions
, which he
asked
, and
when we arrived at the
street
he had
mentioned
,
he
insisted
on
seeing
me
safe
home:
this I
remonstrated
against
,
saying
,
besides
giving him
unnecessary
trouble, it
would make my mother very angry with
me. At this he declared he knew my
mother
very well, and he was not at all afraid
of her anger, as he was certain it lay in his
power to
appease
it. I was
surprised
, you
may imagine, and indeed very
uneasy
all the
rest
of the way, as I knew how offended
my mother would be, at
seeing
a
stranger
come home with me. When the
servant
opened the door he walked in without any
ceremony, and going into the parlour which
was occupied by the gentlewoman who
keeps the
house
, he thus
addressed
her,
Servant, my good madam, your lovely
daughter here, having kindly given me an
invitation home, I flatter
myself
we
shall
spend
a chearful evening, and you and I,
my good mother,
shall
not
disagree
, I
warrant
.
Mrs. Fermor
stared
, and I felt
ready
to
sink
into the earth.
You are under a
mistake
,
sir
,
said
I,
pray leave me. What, leave you,
my little dove, when you have been
so
very
kind, no, no! hardly
such
a fool as that;
come mother, what
shall
I order in for
supper
,
and what wine will you drink?
Miss
Howard,
said
Mrs. Fermor, I am
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
; how have you
dared to bring this gentleman here to
insult
me? Indeed madam, I replied,
terrified
beyond
measure
, I am innocent of
any intention to offend you; this
gentleman
Why,
I can tell the tale as well
as you my pretty one,
said
he,
interrupting
me: you
must
know, madam, I was
coming into
Westminster
, and did not
rightly
know my way,
so
, this pretty, kind
hearted
damsel
was
so
good as to
shew
me, that
is all, ma'am, and
so
in return, I am only
grateful, and would willingly treat you with
a good
supper
, and as far as ten guineas
would go.
At this moment my father came in, and
seeing
me
stand
trembling in the parlour, a
fresh
scene
of
confusion
insued
, which ended
in the whole family believing I had invited
the old gentleman home with me, merely
out of levity, and as Mrs. Fermor called it,
an
indiscreet
frolic. You may
suppose
how
rigorous my mother was, how angry my
father
;
for tho' in his heart, he has not the
least
regard for real virtue, he always
pretends
great attention to my conduct, and this
evening declared he would rather follow me
to the grave than
see
me
lost
to honour.
Oh! Celia, how my
soul
detests
his
hypocrisy
.
It gives me great
uneasiness
to find
just
as my mother began to have a better
opinion of me, I have again
lost
her
considence
;
am again abridged of my walks, and
at home
see
only the frown of
displeasure
,
sit
on that face which once beamed on me
the
smile
of maternal
tenderness
.
My brother is at length
settled
in an
eminent
merchants counting-
house
; I have
engaged
myself
to pay the
necessary
sum
, when
I am put in
possession
of my fortune; and,
to tell you the truth, Celia, I am
resolved
to
stay
in my father's family no longer than that
time; but, by
some
genteel employment,
endeavour to earn
subsistence
for
myself
,
as I am determined not to deprive my
mother
of
support
, by taking the money into
my own hands.
March
5
th
.
My aunt has
just
called, and after a great
deal of
persuasion
, has prevailed with my
mother to let me go to the play to-morrow
evening; I am to go out this afternoon with
my
cousins
, to
purchase
some
few articles of
dress
necessary
to my appearing at a public
place, as my aunt always takes my
cousins
to the
most
conspicuous
part of the theatre.
Well, it will be of little
consequence
to me,
where we
sit
; I go to
see
and not to be
seen
,
I
wish
to be
amused
myself
, but have not the
least
ambition to be the
amusement
of others,
either from my
person
,
dress
or manner.
Well, Celia, had I ever been vain of my
person
, I
should
now be perfectly cured of
so
ridiculous a vanity; but it is happy for
me, that I never thought my face more than
passable
; and as to my
shape
, I knew it had
not the
smallest
pretentions to either grace
or elegance; and, by having this humble
opinion, I have
escaped
a
severe
mortification
;
for you know, my Celia, the
severest
reflections
loose
their force, when we can
listen
to them with good humour, and
return
an
answer
with a
smile
.
I accompanied my aunt and
cousins
to a
milliner's; Mr. Rainsforth and young
Mossop
were of the party. I am
astonished
how
young men can
suffer
themselves
to be
dragged as it were to
such
places, and have
the patience to
listen
to a tedious
desertation
on gauzes, ribbons, lace and a hundred
other trifles,
almost
below the notice of a
rational
being. But, if I was
surprised
at that,
how much more was I to
see
a parcel of
powdered effeminate animals, for I will not
call them men,
stuck
up behind a counter,
measuring
a peny-worth of tape or a
smaller
quantity perhaps; telling you with the
gravity
of a
philosopher
, that
such
a ribond
become your delicate complexion;
such
a
cap
set
off your features to advantage, &c.
And, will you believe it
possible
, that one
morning being in a perfumer's
shop
, I
saw
an officer in the army,
purchasing
chicken
gloves, violet powder and cold cream, aye,
and for his own
use
too, for the
master
informed
me he had neither wife nor
sister
,
to whom
such
things might have been of
use
.
Well, to the milliner's we went, where
Hester
and
Susan
having
chosen
their caps.
I was
pleased
with the choice of the fomer,
and
said
I would have one like it. Lord,
my dear,
said
my aunt, how can you
think of
such
a thing, pretty women you
know may wear any thing, but
those
that
are plain
should
study
what will
most
become
them. Aye, cried young
Mossop
,
my
cousin
to be
sure
should
not wear
any thing that atrtacts general notice.
Here,
said
Susan
, here Meriel, is a
very
pretty cap, I think it will become you
vastly
. It was etremely plain, having no
ornament but a knott of white
sattin
ribbon.
You are quite right,
cousin
,
said
I,
this cap will certainly
suit
me
best
. I
never love to be fine, and what will be
becoming on you, will only appear an
affectation
of finery on me. I
said
this with
a
smile
, as I tried on the cap. Mr.
Rainsforth
told my aunt he thought true beauty
required few ornaments. Come, come,
you rally,
said
she
, you can't think
Meriel
handsome
. He made no
answer
, but
smiling
,
sung
the following
stanza
, which,
as it contained a delicate compliment, you
will pardon me if I here repeat it.
Vol. I. L
She is not fair, but yet I
swear
,
To me
she
has ev'ry grace,
Her lovely mind I always find,
Depicted in her face.
But, my Celia will
say
my letters begin to
be very
insipid
, when I can find no other
theme than the repetition of my own
praise
.
Forgive me, dear girl, this time, I will be
careful how I offend again.
March 7th
.
My entertainment
last
night, exceeded
my
most
sanguine
expectations; the
house
,
the lights, the brilliant and numerous
audience
,
on my
first
entrance, filled me with
silent
astonishment
; but my
cousins
declare
they never will go to the play with me again,
for at the pathetic and
interesting
parts, I
could not conceal my emotion. It was Jane
Shore. Long did I
struggle
to
suppress
my
tears; the effort was vain, and when in the
last
scene
, they drag the
just
reconciled
husband
from the arms of his dying wife, the half
smothered
sobs
burst
forth, and I fell back
in an
hysteric
. You cannot think, how I was
laughed at, and my
cousins
declare they were
so
shocked
at my behaviour, that they
shall
be
ashamed
to
shew
their faces at the
playhouse
again this
season
. One would think
child,
said
my aunt, in a
peevish
tone, as
I began to recover, you never had
seen
a
play in your life before. Well, you know
I never did,
said
I, aloud. This
compleated
my
disgrace
, and my aunt turning toward
the
stage
, noticed me no more the whole
evening.
I think if I were to go again, I
should
like
to
sit
in
some
unnoticed corner, where I
could give
sensibility
the reins, and
whilst
I
wept the woes of
those
whose
sorrows
now
rest
in the
silent
grave, I would
so
mould
my heart, as it
should
be ever ready to
partake
and alleviate the afflictions of
those
who
still
move on the
busy
stage
of life.
One thing, my
cousins
informed me of,
which
considerably
damped my
pleasure
during the evening. They
said
, that many
of the beautiful, elegant women, whom I
saw
in the boxes, were the
slaves
of vice, and
purchased
the gaudy trappings, by which
they were adorned, by the wages of guilt;
and that (but I can hardly think it
possible
)
some
of them are
so
lost
to every
sense
of
virtue
,
that they come to
those
public places with
no other view than to attract new lovers; and
what is
still
worse
, that in a few years; nay,
perhaps even in a few months, I may
see
those
lovely blooming women walking the
streets
,
subject
to the
insults
of every brutal
passenger
,
and
sinking
into an untimely grave, under
the complicated evils of poverty,
sickness
and
disgrace
. I felt my eyes fill as
Hester
concluded
;
and do you not pity them,
said
I:
La!
cousin
,
said
she
, you are the
strangest
girl; you make one laugh to
see
you
now, with that long
dismal
face, talking
about pity for
such
wretches. Perhaps,
said
I, they had no friend to teach them
better, and
surely
, tho' we may
shudder
with
detestation
at their vices, humanity
still
leads
us to pity their
sufferings
. You are as
old
fashioned
in your notions, Meriel,
said
my aunt, who had overheard us, as you
are in your
dress
and manner. You will
know better child when you have
seen
a
little
more of the world. I
must
now quit
my pen to
assist
in
some
necessary
domestic
business
. Believe me, Celia, there is no
pleasure
so
agreeable as writing to you.
MERIEL.
LETTER XIII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
March
30
th
, 1776.
Last
night, having
spent
the evening
with my father and mother, at my
uncle's
;
when we were coming home Mr.
Rainsforth
put a letter into my hand as he handed
me into the coach: I could not well return
it or I would,
so
was obliged to put it in my
pocket; however, I
resolved
not to open it
till I had
first
shewn
it to my mother. When
we got home, it was late, and all
immediately
retired to bed. I will
confess
it
cost
me
no little trouble to
stiflle
the
curiosity
that
prompted me to open the letter. I put it in
a drawer and turned the key; but,
just
then
recollecting that I wanted
something
that was
in that identical drawer, I unlocked it again,
took up the letter, read the
address
, looked
attentively if the wafer was dry; and, after
viewing it on every
side
near a dozen times,
L 2
resolution
at length repelled
curiosity
, I
returned
it to the drawer and locked it again,
without once recollecting why I had opened
it the
second
time.
In the morning I waited till we had done
breakfast
, and then putting the letter into my
mother's hand,
said
, I hope, my dear
madam
,
this will convince you I would not
willingly
be guilty of an impropriety, or have a
concealment of this nature from my
best
friend. She took it with a cold look of
suspicion
,
and having read it,
said
I
suppose
you know the contents. Indeed I do not,
was the reply. You can
guess
, I imagine,
said
she
; no gentleman would have had
the temerity to put a letter into a young
lady's
hand in
such
a
clandestine
manner, had
he not been pretty certain that it would not
be
refused
. Good heavens!
said
I,
bursting
into tears,
shall
I never regain
your confidence?
Must
every action,
however
innocent, be
misconstrued
or liable to
suspicion
. Why Meriel,
said
she
, will
you endeavour to
persuade
me, Mr.
Rainsforth
has never entertained you on the
subject
of love. If I may be believed
madam
,
said
I, with a firm voice, he never
uttered a
syllable
to me that could be
construed
into more than common
politeness
.
Well, child, read the letter then, and tell
me your opinion of the contents. I felt my
face glow as I
cast
my eye over the letter,
which contained a
profession
of ardent
affection
and an offer of his hand, if my father
approved the union.
You
ask
my opinion, dear mother,
said
I, and I will candidly give it; I think
Mr. Rainsforth a very amiable young man,
from what little I have
seen
, but it is
impossible
that I can form any
just
idea of his
character
,
from
so
short
an acquaintance; If
when upon a greater intimacy, I
should
find
him in reality
possessed
of
those
valuable
qualifications, honour and benevolence, and
my father and
yourself
have no objection,
I will not
hesitate
to
confess
, I could give
him my hand, not only without reluctance,
but with
pleasure
.
But
suppose
, Meriel, your father
should
object. If you, madam,
should
also
disapprove
,
I hope I know my duty too well
to complain;
since
your knowledge of
mankind
in general,
must
make you a much better
judge of what will be really conducive to
my
happiness
, than I can
possibly
be
myself
;
however, madam, if
such
objections
should
arise
, I hope you will inform me
soon
, that I
may early begin to teach my heart a
lesson
which,
some
little time hence, I may find a
difficulty in making it obey. My mother
made no
answer
, and
soon
after I left the
room; in the afternoon Mr. Rainsforth
called
;
I felt the colour
flush
to my face: when
he entered he glanced his eyes toward me;
but I believe they brought him no
intelligence
concerning the reception his letter
had met with. He had not been
seated
above ten minutes before my mother made
some
excuse
to
send
me out of the room; I
understood
her perfectly, and was not in
haste
to return; in about an hour I was
sent
for to make tea, but it was the
most
unsocial
meal I had ever partaken of, when
Rainsforth
was
present
: he was
silent
; I was
embarrassed
, and my father and mother,
as is in general the
case
,
spoke
to each other
but little. When tea was over he took his
leave, when my father acquainted me I had
his
permission
to recieve his
addresses
;
said
he believed him a man of honour, and, if his
friends
raised
no objection to the union, he
thought the
sooner
it was compleated the
better. Does not this
eagerness
to
dispose
of me,
shew
how painful my
presence
is to
him? Indeed I do not wonder at it, we
seldom
like to be much in company with
those
persons
whom we are
conscious
of having
injured.
And now, my dear Celia, you will
perhaps
wonder at my
so
readily
listening
to
an offer of marriage from a man with whom
I have
so
small
an acquaintance, but indeed
my
situation
at home is far from being
agreeable
.
My mother's affections
seem
totally
alienated from me, and
lavished
with
redoubled
tenderness
on my brother, who, I am
sorry
to
say
, repays it with ingratitude and
disrespect
.
He is continually teizing her for
money, and tho' he is
conscious
there is no
source
from whence that money can
proceed
,
except from me, yet he is continually
tormenting me by
some
ill natured trick or
other. If we are in a mixed company, every
word I utter is turned into ridicule. If I
sit
silent
, then
sister
is
studying
something
clever
to
say
; if I deliver my
sentiments
on any
subject
that excites my
sensibility
or
veneration
,
then
sister
is going to turn a
sentimental
actress
, or a
methodist
preacher; even
the
respect
I pay to my religious duties is an
object of ridicule, in which my pretty
cousins
always join. If I
express
my
dislike
of cards,
gadding, and its attendant
scandal
, and my
love of retirement,
study
and
domestic
employment
,
then he wonders what Mrs.
Mirvan
could mean by leaving me a fortune,
who could be
so
well content with
pounds three-
score
,
For meat and books, nor
ask
for more.
To which my aunt often replies, aye, Meriel
would make an excellent poor man's wife;
and
these
expressions
often
escape
them
before
people, who think it degrading to be
able to perform, for
themselves
, any of the
necessary
offices of life; and would
blush
to
death were they
supposed
to know how to
make or mend their own linen; for my
own part, I cannot help thinking, if
those
fine ladies had a little more
useful
employment
on their hands, they would not have
so
much time to
investigate
and
expose
the
actions of their neighbours.
You
must
imagine, my dear girl, that I
lead but an uncomfortable kind of life; and
Mr. Rainsforth always
shews
that attention
to me, and takes my part, with
such
delicacy
as
must
unavoidably awaken my gratitude,
if not my affection; and believe me, I now
begin to feel the difference between a real
attachment and the
illusive
wanderings of
the heart. I know how to value the virtues of
my lover, at the
same
time I feel a much
stronger
inclination to act in all things with
that propriety as may render me
respected
.
I feel now the true value of reputation,
honour
and virtue,
because
I entertain a hope of
being one day united to a man,
whose
character
would be injured by my want of either:
and, oh! my Celia, what a
blush
of
confusion
often
spreads
my cheeks, when I reflect on
the letters I wrote to Pringle; how do I
shudder
at the bare
possibility
of
those
letters
one day coming to the eye of Mr. Rainsforth.
Wrote, as they were, at a time when my
imagination was
so
strongly
tinctured with
the
style
of the books I had been reading,
that I
almost
involuntarily wrote the very
sentiments
which I had
just
embibed, with
all the
enthusiasm
of romantic affection.
Ah! Celia,
those
books drew very deceitful
pictures of human life, their
false
colouring
had
raised
my expectations and exalted my
ideas, of love and
friendship
, far above any
thing I can find in the little circle of
acquaintance
I have formed. Perhaps
those
elevated
sentiments
and actions may be
confined
to people of an elevated
sphere
of life,
for I never remember meeting with any hero
or heroine of a
story
, but either were at
first
,
or afterwards proved to be
persons
of rank
and fortune: but
those
are people
so
far
above me, I can never hope to form any
acquaintance with them. I
see
them daily
pass
me in their carriages,
surrounded
with
affluence
,
attended with
respect
; yet
surely
if I know my own heart, I do not envy them,
except, when I think of the power they
possess
to cheer the poor wretch humbled by
affliction, and to
cause
the broken heart to
rejoice. Envy, did I
say
, oh! no, it is not
envy, it is a
sentiment
I cannot find a name
for, it is a
wish
to enjoy
those
transporting
feelings
myself
, without taking from their
felicity; it is an
earnest
desire
to promote,
not
decrease
, the
happiness
of every human
being.
You, my Celia,
secluded
from the world,
in devout retirement, can form but a faint
idea of the many
miseries
with which this
variegated world abounds. Yes, my friend,
and there are
pleasures
too, but they are not
in general
suited
to my
taste
. I hate a crowd;
it may for a moment dazzle the
senses
, but
it leaves no
impression
on the heart. In my
opinion, we cannot experience real
pleasure
,
if we are devoid of
happiness
; and of this I
am certain,
happiness
can
seldom
be drawn
from external objects, but is
sure
to dwell
in the heart,
conscious
of performing its
duty. That
such
happiness
, may ever be
your's and mine, prays your
MERIEL.
LETTER XIV.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
May
17
th
, 1776.
Since
my
last
, few incidents have
happened
,
worthy the notice of my Celia,
except that Mr. Rainsforth, being my
declared
lover, has
astonished
all my uncle's
family. My mother
says
she
is
sure
Hester
and
Susan
are ready to
burst
with envy; I
cannot think it. That dear woman has met
with
so
many painful incidents, in her way
thro' life, that her naturally amiable temper,
is
soured
, and
she
views every thing with a
jaundiced eye. My
cousins
seem
highly
delighted with the idea of an approaching
wedding, and declare they will be my bride
maids. They are
mistaken
in thinking the
wedding will be
so
soon
, Mr. Rainsforth
being
obliged to join his
ship
, which belongs
to the grand fleet at Spithead, and I rather
wish
to remain
single
till this
summer
's
cruise
Vol. I. M
is
past
. If he returns
safe
, I need not tell you
with what joy I
shall
fulfill my engagements:
if not; if it be his fate to fall in the defence
of his country, I will come to you my
beloved
Celia, and become a
pensioner
in the
convent for life. My religion will not
permit
me to take the veil; but my vow of
celibacy will be as
sincere
, breathed from
my own heart to the great Judge of all our
actions, as tho' I made at the foot of the
altar
,
surrounded
by all the pomp of
monkish
superstition
. Pardon me, my beloved friend,
I mean no reflection on the religion you
profess
.
I think that it is not the form but the
heart that is an acceptable
sacrifice
: and the
soul
that humbles
itself
before its Maker, and
cries pardon my numerous
transgressions
,
I am but a worm before thee, the creature
of thy infinite power: if thou
shouldest
forsake
me, who will dare to be my friend;
difpose
of me as in thy
wisdom
thou
shalt
think
fit; I will not complain, but will take
the lot appointed, with
submission
. That
soul
, my Celia, let its form of
worship
be
what it may, will one day
shine
resplendent
in the
mansion
of its Creator. Oh! with
what rapture can we approach the throne of
mercy, when with a heart overflowing with
gratitude, we can
say
, in the words of our
admired Pope:
Teach me to feel another's woe,
To hide the fault I
see
;
That mercy I to others
show
,
That mercy
shew
to me.
But I know my Celia is as void of bigotry as
she
is of every other error.
As Mr. Rainsforth is now, I will not deny,
the
first
object of my
esteem
, I
must
inform
you of the
reasons
which have by degrees
conspired
to
raise
him thus in my opinion.
The day after that mentioned in my
last
letter
,
I received one from him, a copy of which
I have
enclosed
for your
perusal
,
also
my
answer
,
and his
second
letter. After you have
read them, I think you will not blame my
partiality.
MERIEL.
LETTER XV.
MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD,
(
Enclosed
in the foregoing.)
MADAM,
From
a
conversation
I had lately with
Mr. Howard, I find you have made your
parents the confidants of a
passion
, which I
hardly dared venture to
disclose
, even to the
dear object who had excited it; and pardon
me, if I
say
some
peculiarities in the manner
of both Mr. and Mrs. Howard, has been the
cause
of my not applying to them for leave
to
address
their lovely daughter; nor
indeed
,
did I think it quite
consonant
with the
idea of female delicacy, to apply for the
parents
approbation, before I could flatter
myself
that approbation would be entirely
agreeable
to the
person
,
whose
good will I am
most
solicitous
to obtain.
I thank you a
thousand
times, dear,
amiable
young lady, for the
sweet
hope you
have
authorised
your father to give me;
your conduct has, if
possible
,
raised
you in
my
esteem
; and I look forward with a
certainty
of felicity to the moment that
shall
unite us by
indissoluble
ties; for
sure
a
woman
who has
so
high a
sense
of filial duty,
must
ever retain a proper idea of the equally
incumbent duties which will
arise
from the
married
state
; her
husband
's honour will be
safe
in her hands; her children will look up
to her as their friend, and
blessings
will
attend
her
footsteps
wherever
she
appears.
Oh! beloved
Miss
Howard, my heart, that
perfectly
understands
your virtues, exults in
paying them the homage due. The
simplicity
of your manner
first
charmed me, and
pardon
me if I
say
, I
saw
not the charms of your
person
, till I had learnt to adore the
goodness
of your heart; to guard that heart from
every approaching evil,
shall
henceforth be
my
study
: if you will favour me with a few
lines from your own hand, to
say
you do not
refuse
me
so
charming a
guardianship
, and
to confirm me in the hope of being not quite
indifferent to you, it will be acknowledged
as the
highest
obligation, by your faithful
FREDERIC RAINSFORTH.
M 2
LETTER XVI.
MISS HOWARD to MR. RAINSFORTH.
SIR,
Gratitude
will not
suffer
me long
to remain
silent
or inattentive, to a
letter, the contents of which,
seem
to breath
only the
spirit
of
sincerity
; nor will I
hesitate
to
confess
, that the liberty my parents
have granted is perfectly
consonant
with the
feelings of my own heart. Every one who
is honoured with the acquaintance of Mr.
Rainsforth,
must
be
sensible
of his worth,
and to find
oneself
the object of the
tenderest
esteem
, to a truely worthy man,
must
certainly
awaken a degree of laudable pride, in
a
bosom
not devoid of
sensibility
. Accept
my
sincerest
thanks for the many obliging
sentiments
you have
expressed
in my favour,
and give me leave to mention a few
circumstances
with which you may be unacquainted,
but which, I think it highly proper, you
should
be informed of.
It is in general reported that I have four
thousand
pounds for my fortune. This
report
is
false
. I have only a fourth part of
the
sum
. My godmother, Mrs. Mirvan,
made the will in my favour, but with
these
restrictions
; that I
should
never
suffer
my
family
to feel the
necessities
of life. At that
time, Mr. Rainsforth, there was no
prospect
of their ever being reduced from a
state
of
competency, to a dependence on their child;
but
such
is the fluctuating
state
of human
affairs, that this is exactly now the
case
.
This
state
of dependence is extremely painful
to me, and I am
sure
must
be
so
to them. It
is, therefore, my fixed determination, when
I am of age, to
settle
the moiety of my
fortune
on my mother. I am under
engagements
for my father at
present
to the amount
of five hundred pounds, and the other five
hundred
must
be appropriated to the
use
of
my brother, during his
clerkship
, and to
help him forward a little when that is
expired
.
This
disposition
of my little fortune, may
make a material difference in your plans of
life for the future, and I thought it but
right to inform you, that no
interest
of my
own,
shall
ever induce me to alter my
resolution
.
If you think me
still
worthy of your
attentions, I am your's. Do not
smile
at my
frankness
, I have not yet learnt to
disguise
the feelings of my heart. Do not
hesitate
to give a candid
answer
. If the union is not
equally eligible with one, as it would have
been with four
thousand
pounds,
seek
not
to
excuse
yourself
for withdrawing your
addresses
, I will not even require an apology
for a conduct, to which I am certain,
nothing
but the
most
powerful
reasons
, could
have forced you.
I am, Sir, your friend
and humble
servant
,
MERIEL HOWARD.
LETTER XVII.
MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD.
Shall
I not chide you, my dear
Miss
Howard;
shall
I not tell you what I
felt at the reception of your dear unkind
letter
.
Dear it will ever be to my fond
bosom
,
because
in the
sincerity
of your language,
I could read the affection of your heart.
Smile at your
frankness
; how could
you think of
such
a thing. No, I adore you
for it, and
surely
the man who could
despise
a heart for its
sincerity
,
deserves
not to
possess
so
invaluable a
blessing
. May
Miss
Howard
never learn to
disguise
feelings which,
chastened
as they are, by honour and
feminine
delicacy, become an honour to the
heart; but
still
I
must
chide. What could
you think, when you
say
, if the union is
not equally eligible with one, as it would
have been with four
thousand
pounds.
Unkind Meriel, do you
suppose
millions
could
increase
my love, or could they make
you more valuable. No, they could not;
therefore,
dispose
of your fortune in any
manner you
shall
think fit, give me only
yourself
, and I
shall
think I
possess
a jewel,
which worlds could not
purchase
.
I am every day expecting orders to join the
fleet. Will you, my dear
Miss
Howard,
pardon
my impatience, if I
wish
to call you mine
before
these
orders arrive. I
shall
have a
thousand
doubts and fears if I leave you
before
we are irrevocably united. Perhaps
some
one more worthy; Oh! forgive my
suspicions
, but who can love and not fear to
lose
the object of their
fondest
hopes.
Methinks
could I once call you mine, the
thought would
inspire
me with courage.
Should I be called into action
against
the
enemy
of my country, honour, ambition,
thirst
of fame
should
all give way to love. For
you alone would I fight, for your
sake
alone
wish
to conquer, and your love
should
be
the reward of all my toils.
I will
spend
an hour with you to-morrow
evening. Oh! my
sweet
friend, let your
mild eyes tell me, at meeting, you cannot
refuse
the ardent prayer of your ever faithful
FREDERIC RAINSFORTH.
LETTER XVIII.
MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.)
But
I did
refuse
him, Celia, tho' my
little rebellious heart would have fain
played the traitor. Be
still
, little fool,
said
I,
Meriel will learn to be thy
mistress
: think
not, by thy flutterings and throbings, to
counteract
resolutions
which
reason
tells me
are right and laudable. So, my dear girl,
I
persevered
in the determination of not
giving
Rainsforth my hand, till the
summer
's
cruise
was over, and he was obliged to
submit
with as good a grace as he could, tho'
I
assure
you, he looked quite blank upon it.
And now, my dear girl, I will give you my
reasons
for thus
obstinately
opposing
the
proposed
union. You know I
shall
be eighteen
in September, when being
mistress
of my
fortune
,
I may
dispose
of it as I have already
designed
, without being
answerable
to any
one. Now, if I marry
first
, I certainly make
my
husband
master
, not only of
myself
, but
of all I
possess
; and how do I know what
objections
may
arise
on his part in the
course
of a few months. I do not mean, that I
doubt Rainsforth's
generosity
; but a change
of
circumstances
produces a change of ideas,
and I think it is
best
not to
trust
too much
to the
firmness
of our own hearts.
My aunt laughed the other day, and
said
she
questioned
if I
should
ever be married,
for
absence
and
salt
water are in general a
cure for love. It may prove
so
with
some
, but
I do not much fear the
constancy
of a man,
who braves even the
shaft
of ridicule, by
openly avowing me the woman of his choice;
for I can
see
many a
sneering
smile
, glance
from my aunt to her
son
, whenever they are
witness
to his attention to your Meriel.
My father and mother
seem
totally
regardless
,
whether I am married now, or when he
returns; and I believe, if the truth was
known, are very little concerned about my
future welfare. But yet, Celia, my
bosom
cannot forget its natural affections, or
divest
itself
of
those
strong
sensations
of duty, love
and veneration, which ever have warmed it,
since
my infant tongue
first
lisp
'd the tender
name of mother. As to my father, I cannot
say
I feel any emotions in his favour, nor
can it be expected I
should
, after the
scenes
which I have imparted to you, the horrors
of which will never be removed from my
mind. Alas! they often recur to my
imagination
and
cast
a gloom over every
rising
pleasure
. Yet, as a man
whose
happiness
is
nearly connected with my mother's; as the
man whom nature requires me to regard, I
will pay him every
necessary
respect
, and as
far as the narrow limits of my power will
permit, will promote his
interest
and felicity.
May
19
th
.
Celia, he is gone; I have this moment
bade him farewell. I feel there are moments
when all the fortitude, we
boast
,
sinks
into
nothing
opposed
to the
struggles
of nature;
would you believe it, at the moment when
I
saw
him
step
into the
chaise
, I would have
given worlds, had I
possessed
them, to have
been his wife, that I might have gone with
him, beheld him to the very
last
moment of
embarkation, and even then have
stood
on
the
shore
to catch a
last
look at the
expanded
sails
which bore him from me, till by
degrees
they
lessened
to my view, and at length
were
lost
in the
vast
horizon.
My aunt and
cousins
where with us
drinking tea; Rainsforth came in, when I
instantly
saw
something
was the matter.
The order is at length arrived,
said
I,
mentally
,
Vol. I. N
and he comes to bid me adieu; I
handed
him a cup of tea, he put it to his lips but
did not
taste
it. I am come
Miss
Howard,
said
he, to take my leave; the fleet
sails
in a few days. Do you go this evening,
said
my mother. In a few moments,
madam
,
said
he, I
just
recieved the letter,
and accidently met with two brother officers,
who were going in a
chaise
, and gladly
accepted
me as a third; we mean to take two
stages
to night, and
shall
be in
Portsmouth
by to-morrow noon. At that moment the
chaise
stopped
at the door. Rainsforth
rose
,
bowed to my aunt and
cousins
, thanked
them for all civilities,
wished
my father
and mother health, and then turned toward
me. My heart was full,
so
was his; we
neither
of us
spoke
; he
pressed
my hands to
his lips, bowed low to hide his emotions,
and was in the
chaise
in an
instant
. I knew
sensibility
would be deemed
weakness
by
those
who were
witness
to our parting; I
therefore
struggled
to
suppress
my
rising
tears, offered up a
silent
prayer for his
safe
return, and endeavoured at a look of
composure
,
that was very foreign to my heart.
What may be his fate, heaven alone can
tell; yet
sure
if worth is its peculiar care,
he will not only be protected in this, but in
every other danger. But alas! Celia, how
often do we
see
merit cut off in its full prime,
whilst
the unworthy are
spared
.
Surely, when the brave and good fall in
their country's
cause
, it
must
be that their
virtues merit
such
rewards as only heaven
can give. They are
suffered
to appear on
the
vast
theatre of life, to act a little while
bright
shining
parts, and then are called
home to receive the glorious mead of
heavenly
and
unceasing
joys. My mind
dwelling
on this
subject
the other evening, (you
know I am fond of indulging in little
effusions
of poetry,) and painting to
myself
the
situation
of a
soldier
's wife, who has
followed
her
husband
to the very
scene
of battle,
and in the morn,
sending
him forth to brave
the
hostile
foe, at night
sees
him covered with
wounds and in the agonies of death; I for
a moment fancied
myself
in her
situation
,
and wrote the following trifle. I
send
it to
my Celia without an apology,
because
trifles
become valuable when they proceed
from the friend we love.
MERIEL.
ANNA.
(
Enclosed
in the foregoing.)
THE day was
past
, the
ensanguin
'd plain,
O'
erspread
with many a valiant hero
slain
;
When Anna to her
breast
her infant caught,
And '
mongst
the
slaughter
'd heaps her Henry
sought
.
The pale moon
shed
a feeble ray of light,
Which added to the horrors of the night.
Trembling with
anguish
and
despair
,
To heaven
she
thus
address
'd her pray'r.
Just
power, who
saw
my Henry fall,
Conduct me where he lies,
And let me bath his wounds in tears,
And let me
seal
his eyes.
This morn, when he went forth, I pray'd
No evil might betide him,
But
since
he fell, oh guide me where,
And let me die
beside
him.
Henry tho' dying knew his Anna's voice,
Cried, dry
those
tears, my Anna and
rejoice
;
For tho' I'm
lost
to thee, yet future
story
,
Shall tell, thy Henry liv'd and died with glory.
And teach my boy the road to fame, he
cried,
Farewell! then faintly
graspt
her hand
and died.
Weeping
she
knelt and
kissed
the
breathless
clay,
And vow'd his
last
injunctions to obey.
Yes
matchless
youth, tho'
lost
to me,
By hope
inspir
'd, in thought I
see
On glory's wings thy
spirit
rise
,
And angles waft it to the
skies
.
I'll tell my
son
his father's deeds,
And tho' my heart with
anguish
bleeds,
I'll teach his
soul
, like thine to
soar
,
And mark the path thou'
st
trod before.
Then tho' like thee, he yields his breath,
I'll glory in my hero's death.
N 2
LETTER XIX.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
July
20
th
, 1776.
This
brother of mine is a
sad
lad. He
will not be content to remain where
he has been placed, but has taken it into
his
wise
head that he
must
go to
sea
;
nothing
else
will
suit
him, he cannot, he
says
,
be confined to the drudgery of a
counting-houe
,
where a
person
may toil all their lives
and
rise
to nothing above mediocrity. He
will go to
sea
, where, with one bold
push
, it
often happens that a man gains both honour
and fortune. The lad
seems
to be
possessed
of the
spirit
of ambition, yet not that
laudable
ambition which acts as a
stimulus
to
actions great and
praise
worthy. It is
power
and wealth he aims at, and be the
steps
ever
so
dirty, by which he
must
arrive at
the
desired
eminence, I much fear he would
not
hesitate
to wade thro' thick and thin.
However, as that is his fixed determination,
I
must
e'en be content with the
lost
of the
apprentice fee, tho' here is a
fresh
source
of
expense
in fitting him out as a
midshipman
,
for in that
situation
I find he can be
admitted
on board the
ship
where Rainsforth
is lieutenant. I
wish
to my
soul
an intimate
acquaintance with this worthy man, may
be of
service
to him, for we often
insensibly
imbibe the
sentiments
of
those
with whom
we
associate
.
My father, I fear, is running into his old
errors; he has formed an acquaintance with
a Mr. Dell, which in my opinion bodes no
good. Dell appears much of the gentleman
in his manner, but young
Mossop
says
he is
a
prosessed
gambler, and I am rather
inclined
to believe this
assertion
, as my father is
frequently out with him till three or four in
the morning, and has drained us
so
of
money
,
that we have not a
single
guinea for
house
expences; this will
occasion
our
getting
into debt, and I am afraid my father
has already borrowed money on the
strength
of my
promise
, in regard to my fortune; if
so
all my endeavours to
preserve
my mother
from want will be ineffectual. This Dell
has a wife, whom he once brought to
spend
an afternoon with us; I do not like her;
there was
something
in her
dress
and
manner
,
bold, forward and
disgusting
;
she
has
been pretty, and is vain enough to think
she
is
so
now. My mother does not admire her
any more than
myself
, and only that
she
thinks it would highly
disoblige
my father,
she
would by no means either recieve or
return
her
visits
.
Another
source
of
unhappiness
to this
dear
suffering
woman is my father's giving
way to a habit of drinking, for he is
almost
continually intoxicated, and
so
extremely
captious and ill natured that it is next to
impossible
to
say
or do any thing to
please
him.
Poor dear mother how my heart bleeds for
your afflictions; how many years have you
past
wherein you can
scarcely
say
, you have
seen
one happy hour; and could I, but lead
you to
repose
your
sorrows
on the
bosom
of
your child! but no, you think that child
unworthy of your love, unworthy your
confidence
;
and
she
dares not clear
herself
,
lest
by endeavouring to remove one
sorrow
from
your heart,
she
should
throw another on it
that would
crush
you with its weight.
I have heard from Rainsforth but once
since
the fleet
sailed
. Oh! Celia,
should
he
one day afflict my heart, by
harshness
,
cruelty
or infidelity; ah! my friend, if the
thought thus wrings my
bosom
, what would
the reality do; and yet, I would endeavour
to bear it with the
meekness
of a wife, and
the fortitude of a
christian
; but me thinks I
would
wish
to
sink
at once under the
dreadful
certainty; doubt and
suspicion
would
torture me to the very
utmost
of my
strength
to bear, but to be convinced I had out lived
his affection,
must
, I am convinced, be
instant
death or
madness
.
My letters have now nothing
interesting
in them; Indeed, Celia, I begin to think
every thing
insipid
and
tiresome
, that is not
concerning Rainsforth; even reading no
more
amuses
. If I read of a worthy
character
,
such
a one I cry is my Frederic; then
I drop the book to
muse
upon his virtues,
and if I take up my pen I can write but an
invocation to heaven for his
safety
. The
only
relief I find is in
constant
employment,
and therefore, I
seldom
pass
an idle hour,
my needle, my pencil, and my
domestic
concerns
,
pleasingly
variegate the
scene
, and
prevent my complaining of
lassitude
. I go
out but little, and
see
but few
visitors
, my
cousins
indeed frequently call, but as I do
not mix in the
same
gay circles they do, I
can join but little in their
conversation
; they
tell me many lively anecdotes that
amuse
me; I
listen
to their account of a ball, a
concert, or any other
fashionable
amusement
with a
smile
,
because
it gives me
pleasure
to
see
them happy. My mother
says
they give
me
these
accounts only to mortify me; if
so
, they greatly
miss
their aim; I feel no
inclination
to mix in the giddy throng of the
votaries to
pleasure
. Nature never
designed
me for
dress
,
bustle
, and parade; my
highest
wish
is to
steal
thro' life unnoticed, but
by the friends I love, and to die before I
know their
loss
or the privation of their
esteem
.
Adieu, my Celia. In your prayers
remember
the beloved of your
MERIEL.
LETTER XX.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
November

th
, 1776.
Celia
, you are happy. You never
formed
a
wish
beyond the narrow bounds
prescribed
by your
monastic
rules. Your
heart never vibrated with love, with hope,
with
sensations
undescribably
pleasing
, when
the object of that love returned in
safety
from
the
boisterous
elements, and
still
more
dreadful
fury of enemies. And is it, do you
ask
,
a
happiness
to be deprived of
those
sweet
sensations
?
Yes, my friend it is; for then you
cannot
suffer
the keen pang, which at this
moment
rends the heart of your friend. Read
the
enclosed
, which I have
just
received, and
tell me if you do not pity your
MERIEL.
LETTER XXI.
MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD,
(
Enclosed
in the preceding.)
Plymouth
,
November
13
th
, 1776.
Will
my dear Meriel believe that it is
with pain I take up my pen to
address
her; that I am at
loss
for words, yet
ardently long to pour out my
soul
before her.
I have braved the perils of the
sea
, my love, I
am
safe
arrived at my
destined
port, but not
within
sight
of
happiness
. Alas! that golden
dream which has buoyed me up, and
cheered
me
whilst
absent
from all my
soul
held
dear, is
vanished
. The lovely prize which I
thought would have rewarded all my
hardships
,
is
wrested
from me. Oh! beloved
Meriel, I am
lost
, forlorn, and wretched.
You never can be mine, Meriel: never! Oh
my heart, yet hold a little,
burst
not till I
have told my gentle love, how much this
resignation
costs
me. But I am a beggar, and
shall
I marry thee, my
dearest
girl, and bring
a wretched race of innocents into a life of
penury
and woe. Shall I lead my gentle
Meriel
to the altar, when I am certain our only
patrimony will be want and
misery
. Oh no!
humanity! honor! love! forbid it.
My father is a bankrupt, nor has he
saved
enough from the wreck of his fortune to
support
even for a few months, his wife and three
small
children: and
shall
not I, who
received
from him life, education, every valuable
gift:
shall
not I prefer his
happiness
to my
own? Yes, my adored Meriel, I will, dear as
thou art to this fond doating heart; I will
renounce
even thee, and devote my little
income
to the
support
of my father and his
family
.
Adieu my
sweet
love, may balmy peace,
with healing on her wing
descend
to thy
lovely
bosom
,
mayest
thou, (for it will be
necessary
to thy peace)
banish
the
hapless
Rainsforth from my mind; or think only of
him as one
lost
to thee, the world, and to
himself
.
And may you, with
some
happier,
worthier
youth, find every
blessing
, every
earthly
comfort: but be
assured
,
whilst
I retain
the
least
trace of memory, you, and you
only
,
shall
possess
the affections of my heart.
Vol. I. O
Whilst
life remains you will be the
dearest
object
of my fond
wishes
; and when called from
this
transitory
scene
, my
last
breath will be
spent
in a prayer for your
happiness
. Adieu,
dear amiable
Miss
Howard: may the
choicest
gifts of heaven be
showered
on you. Oh!
how my heart bleeds while I write.
Beloved
of my
soul
, farewell forever.
FREDERIC RAINSFORTH.
LETTER XXII.
MISS HOWARD TO MR. RAINSFORTH.
London
,
November
16
th
, 1776.
Adieu
, forever, did you
say
: no,
Rainsforth, no! we
shall
yet meet
many times, our
souls
are congenial; they
were animated the by
same
spark
of
intellectual
fire, and tho' we cannot claim a
nearer
tie, we
shall
be friends to the
latest
hour
of our
existence
.
My generous, noble friend, I do not
blush
to
say
my
esteem
, (nay call it love, if you
will) is
increased
by this proof of your
magnanimity
;
call it not a
resignation
, I am
your's I will never be another's;
unless
I
can find one your
superior
in every virtue,
that can exalt and dignify human nature,
and in
saying
that, I think I am irrevocably
bound to you. There may be men who
possess
equal
goodness
of heart, but there
can be none who can
boast
a
superiority
.
I am
sensibly
affected at your father's
misfortunes
;
would to heaven it was in my
power to remove every affliction far from
him. Not
so
much from the idea that his
troubles have interrupted my
happiness
;
but that I am certain your feeling heart
suffers
those
misfortunes doubly, in
seeing
them inflicted on one
so
deservedly
dear to
you. But let us look forward my friend;
the
prospect
is not
so
dark, but that the
sun
of
prosperity
may yet brake forth to enliven it;
you may yet live to
see
your father
reinstated
in the afluence, from which he is at
present
removed by an all-wife Providence,
only
to teach him the value of
past
blessings
.
We never know rightly, how to prize a
benefit
,
till we have known what it is to
lose
it; I write feelingly Rainsforth, for, I knew
not half your worth till the very moment that
I
saw
an
insuperable
barrier placed between us,
and now I
wish
I had
listened
to your
solicitations
,
for then at this moment I might have
administered
comfort to your drooping
spirits
,
and
assisted
in the delightful
task
of
soothing
the
sorrows
of your parents. But
why
should
I be
so
selfish
, the
pleasure
would
have been all my own; for
sure
I knew
your generous heart too well, to
suppose
it
would not have
suffered
from the idea of
my
sharing
in afflictions, which could not
have been prevented, and hardly admit of
any aleviation. To
say
I felt nothing when
I read your pathetic letter, would be to
pronounce
myself
insensible
. Believe me, I felt
all; nay, perhaps more than you could have
wished
; however, of this be
assured
, that
nothing but a total change in you can
occation
any alteration in my
sentiments
. If it
will be more conducive to your
happiness
;
here let the
correspondence
cease
, and
should
you hereafter meet a woman,
whose
merits
and fortune render her worthy your
attachment
;
may you be as happy in the union
as the lot of mortallity will allow. Adieu,
every kind
wish
of my heart is your's.
MERIEL HOWARD.
LETTER XXIII.

[1]
Between this and the foregoing letter, there are
several
omitted, which
passed
between
Miss
Howard and
her friend. As they contained nothing but complaints
of Mr. Howard's behaviour, and an account of young
Howard's going to India, on a three year's
station
. This
occasions
a
space
of eighteen months.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
May
6
th
, 1778.
It
is in vain to
strive
against
fate. My
father is
resolved
not to
pause
in his
career
of folly, till we are all involved in ruin.
2 O
The money I
presented
to my mother, when
I took
possession
of my fortune, is all
mouldered
away, and even the little capital I had
reserved
for
myself
, broke in upon. I know
you will
say
I am
pursuing
my notions of
filial duty now to imprudence; I fear I am,
and yet, my dear Celia, were you
situated
as I am, I
so
well know your heart,
that I am certain you would have conducted
yourself
exactly in the
same
manner.
About three days
since
, a gentleman
called
and
presented
a bill for payment, drawn
by my brother, who had given my mother
notice of his
design
; but
she
, fearful of
mentioning it, as
she
had no means of
answering
the demand, had kept it to
herself
.
It was for an hundred pounds. Ungenerous
lad! when he knew how narrow our
circumstances
were, and how much his
inconsistent
conduct had
embarrassed
us. When the
man brought the bill, my poor mother
turned
pale as
ashes
. What is the matter,
madam,
said
I. She called me into the
next room, and putting the bill into my
hand, (for it was
some
days after
sight
)
she
said
, what
must
I do. Indeed my dear
madam, I replied, I cannot tell. It is
not in my power to do any more, the bill
must
be
protested
, and I hope it will teach
him frugality in future. I am
sure
he
must
have been very extravagant, or he never
could have wanted money
so
soon
,
considering
the
sum
he took with him. She made
me no
answer
, but
bursting
into tears cried,
then all is over, my poor Richard. I
never
can
see
my mother in affliction, but my
heart yearns
spontaniously
to fly to her
relief
.
How then could I behold her tears
unmoved, how hold back that comfort
she
required, when
she
thus continued to
address
me. I know, Meriel, we have
almost
reduced
you to beggary, I am fully
sensible
how much we owe to your
generosity
.
Dear, dear mother, talk not
so
,
said
I,
throwing my arms about her, I have done
nothing but my duty, and I think it
still
my
duty to
preserve
the remainder of my
fortune
,
to comfort you in your declining age.
But think of your brother, Meriel, cried
she
eagerly, think my dear girl, what
straits
he may reduced to in a foreign land.
If this bill is not paid, my poor boy will be
thrown into
prison
, and be
lost
for want of
a friend to comfort him. Oh! Meriel,
refuse
not your mother this one
request
. And
ah! my Celia, may I never meet
such
another
trial. The dear woman knelt; yes,
my mother knelt to me before I had the
time or power to prevent her. Good
heavens!
said
I, this is too much, take
me, dear mother, do with me and mine as
you think proper, only I
beseech
you do
not let me be thus humiliated. 'Tis I
should
have knelt to you, oh!
rise
, and do not thus
distress
me. I will pay the bill.
The next day I took up money
sufficient
for that
purpose
, and
also
to
discharge
some
sew
debts in the neighbourhood,
so
that our
income is now
so
reduced that I
must
be
obliged to turn my thoughts towards
some
genteel employment, however repugnant it
is to my father and mother's inclinations.
In my opinion, the
person
who has talents,
health and
spirits
to earn a
subsistence
, is in
all
respects
independent, and there is
nothing
to me would be more painful, than to
eat the bread of indolence. Pride may
teach another
lesson
, but then it is not the
pride which elevates the human heart. It
shall
be ever my pride to keep free from
obligation
.
It is always a painful
sense
, but
more
especially
when we have no power to
return it. Let my habitation be ever
so
humble, and my fare ever
so
coarse
, if they
are the fruits of my own
industry
, they will
be
sweeter
, more comfortable by far, than
the
greatest
luxuries
purchased
by the cringe
of
servility
.
May
7
th
.
Rejoice with me, my dear Celia, the
prospect
once more brightens. I
yesterday
received
the following letter from Rainsforth.
TO MISS HOWARD.
MY ever loved, my
constant
Meriel will,
I am certain, rejoice to hear that my father
is again
restored
to affluence. A
distant
relation, lately dead, has bequeathed the
whole of his wealth, which is very
considerable
,
to our family. To me he has given
five
thousand
pounds. Then let me
hasten
to bid my beloved Meriel be prepared to
see
me; for this day week, I will come to
demand
her long
promised
hand, and
seal
myself
before the altar, her's eternally.
FREDERIC RAINSFORTH.
And
shall
I now ever dare to complain of
past
trials, my Celia? has not this proof of his
love and
constancy
endeared him more than
ever to my heart? Oh my friend, my
spirits
are
so
agitated, I cannot write or
speak
with
any coherence, I
must
throw
aside
my pen
and endeavour to
compose
my thoughts.
My
cousin
Hester
has
just
left me. I
shewed
her Rainsforth's letter in the
fullness
of
my heart, and claimed her
promise
of being
bride maid. I thought
she
did not look
pleased
and hurried away very
soon
after
she
had read the letter. I
shall
make but little
preparation
against
his arrival. I know he
regards me only for
myself
, and alas! that is
all I now have to
bestow
.
Two days more and I
shall
see
him; think
me not weak, if I tell you I
shall
count the
hours with impatience. After a
seperation
of
near two years, how
pleasing
to meet a friend
whom we know to be
so
worthy, and whom
we had given up as
lost
. Farewell, my dear
Celia, your
pleasures
are all of the calm
unruffled
kind, like the
smooth
stream
that
glides beneath a lofty bank, by which it is
defended from the rude
blasts
of wind. It
continues one gentle unvaried
course
, and its
charms can neither be
increased
or
diminished
.

MERIEL to CELIA.
London

I have
expected morning after morning
with hope, and each day as it arrived
brought with it only
disappointment
. I will
decieve
myself
no longer, nothing but death,
or extreme
illness
could have kept him from
me, tho' I have been told that he meant
from the
first
to decieve me, and that my
easy
fondness
has been a theme for ridcule
for him and his gay companions. But I
cannot believe it, Celia, if he is
false
, where
shall
we find a man worthy to be
esteemed
.
No, Rainsforth, there certainly
must
be
some
very urgent
cause
for this
absence
,
this, I had
almost
said
, cruel
silence
; but I
will not give up the opinion I have formed
of your integrity.
May
20
th
.
Celia, I am ill, very ill, my heart has
recieved
a
shock
it will never recover;
Rainsforth
is married! married to another, and
within a fortnight after the day appointed to
unite him to me.
My
cousin
Hester
called on me
yesterday
to take a walk; we called on a lady of her
acquaintance who has a
sister
married at
Plymouth, for
Hester
suggested
that through
her means we might gain
some
intelligence
concerning Rainsforth. After the
usual
ceremonies
,
when we were
seated
,
Hester
enquired
when
she
had heard from her
sister
,
I had a letter
yesterday
,
she
replied,
Kitty has been very gay, I
assure
you, they
have had great doings at Plymouth,
Miss
Kingly, the great
heiress
, was married
last
Monday, and Kitty was at the wedding.
And pray who is
she
married to?
said
Hester
. A young officer in the navy,
she
replied, whom
she
has been fond of
for
some
time; I really forget his name, but
there is the letter, you may read the whole
account.
I do not know how I
supported
myself
,
while I
cast
my eye over the letter, as
my
cousin
held it in her hand, but I caught
the name of Rainsforth; my head grew
giddy, I turned cold and faint; but by the
exertion of my
resolution
avoided making
myself
ridiculous. Upon my word,
cousin
,
said
Hester
without any regard to my
feelings, in
exposing
me to a
stranger
,
upon
my word, this is very unaccountable.
Why pray,
said
the lady, is it the
Mr. Rainsforth I have
seen
so
often with
you
Miss
Mossop
? The very
same
, and
will you believe it, he was under a
promise
of marriage to my
cousin
here; do you not
think it very
scandalous
behaviour?
Scandalous
indeed: if I was in
Miss
Howard's
place I would
sue
him for half his wife's
fortune
.
I
shall
not give either
myself
or him
that trouble, madam, (I replied with as
much
composure
as I could
assume
,) I think
since
he has proved
himself
of
so
fickle a
nature, he has done me a favour rather than
an injury, as it would have been much more
painful to me to
lose
the affection of a
husband
than a lover. Pride my dear
madam
added I with a forced
smile
) keeps up
our
spirits
on
these
occasions
.
I returned home from this
visit
with a
heavy heart, but
still
flattered
myself
there
might be
some
mistake
; but the receipt of
the letter I
inclose
for your
perusal
has
removed
every doubt.

MR RAINSFORTH SEN. to MISS HOWARD.
Plymouth

th
, 1778.
MADAM,
Looking
over
some
papers which were
lately in
possession
of my
son
, I found
some
letters which I think proper to return
to you; and am very
sorry
if any thing
has
passed
between you that may
occasion
you future
uneasiness
. I am obliged to
you for the very generous
sentiments
expressed
in
those
letters, towards my whole
family, and beg leave to inform you, that
your kind
wishes
,
respecting
my
son
's
happiness
,
are amply fulfilled, as he was
yesterday
married to a very amiable woman,
possessing
a fortune of twenty
thousand
pounds.
I am, madam,
your humble
servant
,
F. RAINSFORTH.
MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.)
WITH this letter, my dear Celia, came a
parcel containing all the letters I had ever
wrote to Rainsforth; and believe me, the
unfeeling tenor of his father's letter did not
hurt me half
so
much, as the idea of his
cruelty, in
suffering
his father
first
to
peruse
,
and then return them; my pride was
alarmed
,
my
sensibility
shocked
! a man in whom I
placed
such
implicit confidence; one whom
I thought endowed with every virtue. Celia,
I feel a painful void in my heart; I feel that
I
shall
never again place a confidence in any
man. My
cousin
Hester
has frequently told
me, that Rainsforth was decietful, that he
A 2
saw
my partiality and played upon it,
merely
for his own
diversion
; but I always
doubted
;
nay, to
such
a height was my
enthusiasm
raised
, I could not have believed it
possible
for one who wore
so
fair a
semblance
of virtue, to be
so
very
false
,
so
unaccountably
wanton in his cruelty towards an
inoffensive
girl,
whose
whole
soul
was
absorbed
in one affectionate
wish
for his felicity: why,
when I had taught my heart to
resign
him
without a murmur; why, when the
first
hard trial was
past
, and every hope was
extinguished
,
did he
seek
to awaken a
passion
,
which, tho'
reason
had in
some
measure
repelled
its violence, was
still
tender,
still
ardent
in my
bosom
. Oh! my friend, had he
without renewing the
correspondence
which
we had mutually agreed to drop, given his
hand to
Miss
Kingly, I
should
not have
complained
;
no, my Celia,
so
pure was my
love, that I
should
have exulted in his
felicity
,
and
whilst
I thought him worthy of every
blessing
, have rejoiced to
see
them placed
within his reach. But alas! he is not
worthy
,
and perhaps this poor gentle
affectionate
girl, for
such
I am told
she
is, may
soon
experience a change in his
sentiments
, when
she
has neither the power to leave him, nor
liberty to complain of his conduct.
May
20
th
.
I begin to be more
composed
; I am
resolved
to
despise
the whole
sex
; they may
wear a
semblance
of virtue, but the reality
of it is foreign to their hearts. Every
occurrence
of life will be now equally
indifferent
to me; I have vowed to devote
myself
to my mother while
she
lives, and whenever
heaven
pleases
to call her away, my
incessant
prayer
shall
be
soon
to follow; I do
not
wish
to go before her,
because
, I
see
her
only hope of
support
must
proceed from me;
and unboundedly grateful will be my heart,
if by any means whatever I can
preserve
her
from
misery
.
May
29
th
.
It was certainly a
wise
dispensation
of
Providence
,
that prevented my union with
Rainsforth; had I been
separated
from my
dear mother, where now would
she
have
found a comforter. My father is in
prison
Celia; my whole fortune is expended; but
thank heaven, I have
still
health and
strength
to work. I live in a
miserable
apartment
in the Fleet
prison
, I
sit
lost
as it were to
every thing but
misery
; but yet, my dear
Celia, I can look up to heaven with
gratitude
;
I am not a wife, I am not a mother,
I feel not the
strong
chords of maternal
affection
twining round my heart, and
wringing
it with unutterable
anguish
; I might
have been more wretched than I am: and
whilst
I can
say
that, let me
express
only
gratitude towards the great Ruler of the
universe
,
who has not tried me beyond my
strength
to
support
. Can you think, my
friend, that in this
miserable
situation
I have
yet one ray of comfort breaks on my
benighted
soul
; yes, Celia, I have: my dear mother
is at length convinced, that my love, my
dutiful
attentions, are the
result
of the feelings of
my heart. On me alone
she
now
rests
; to me
alone looks for comfort; her eyes once
more beam on me with affection; her heart
again is lift up to heaven for my felicity;
and who my dear friend, who that knows
the
just
value of maternal love, would not
gladly
resign
wealth, nay
almost
every
consideration
,
to enjoy
so
inestimable
a
blessing
.
I cannot at this time give you
particulars
;
indeed, I know not why I
should
write
to you at all, for
sure
my letters convey no
pleasure
to your friendly
bosom
, but I cannot
give up the
greatest
pleasure
of my life,
unless
you
expressly
desire
it. To you I can unfold
my thoughts; to you, tell the
sorrows
of my
heart; and as I write, fond fancy
represents
you as feeling for my afflictions: I
see
the tear
of
sympathy
tremble in your eye; I hear the
soft
cheering voice of
consolation
break
from your lips: I am
soothed
; I am
comforted
by the thought:
surely
, my Celia,
will not
refuse
, this
almost
only
consolation
to her afflicted
MERIEL.
LETTER XXVI.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Fleet
prison
,
June
10
th
, 1778.
I have
now
sat
down, to give you the
particulars of a
scene
, which, when I
last
wrote, I could not command
sufficient
composure
to deleniate. I had been out one
afternoon
on particular
business
; indeed to
look after
some
employment, whereby I
might conduce to the
support
of the family.
On my return I found my mother weeping
over a bit of paper, which
she
held in her
hand. I enquired the
cause
. She gave me
the paper, and I read on it, Barwell,
Sheriff's
officer, Carey-
street
. Your father
is
arrested
, Meriel,
said
she
. Gracious
heaven!
said
I, then we are all ruined:
but what is the
sum
; at
whose
suit
is he
arrested
. At the
suit
of that villain
Dell,
she
replied, for fifty pounds, which
he has lent him; no doubt at the gaming
table; he
also
threatens him with a
prosecution
for a criminal
correspondence
with
his wife. Oh heavens! continued
she
,
redoubling
her tears, when
shall
I die and
be at peace. It was in vain to offer
consolation
.
I did not even attempt it, but
resolved
,
if
possible
, to
see
if any thing could
be done, either to ward off the impending
blow, or to extricate us from the difficulties
attending it. I went immediately to an
attorney
,
made him acquainted with the
case
,
and
requested
his advice. He told me there
was no
redress
, that the money
must
be paid,
and in
case
of the
prosecution
, it was
most
likely he would be
cast
with damages. This
intelligence was an additional weight upon
my
spirits
. However, I proceeded to
Careystreet
,
where I found this
thoughtless
father
surrounded
by unfortunate men of the
lowest
class
, with a bowl of punch before him,
and in the very act of
singing
a drinking
song
. When he
saw
me, he looked
abashed
.
I
asked
if I coud
speak
to him in another
room, for my
soul
shrunk
from the
society
of
those
unhappy beings, with whom he
seemed
so
pleased
. When we were
accommodated
with another apartment, I
asked
him, how this debt was contracted, and by
what means he meant to
discharge
it. I
cannot
repeat to you the
answer
he made; it
was
so
replete with contradiction, that I
had
scarcely
patience to hear him out. When
he had
finished
, I enquired, if that debt was
paid, were there no others of the
same
sort
.
Consider
sir
,
said
I, it will not be long
I
shall
have it in my power to
answer
these
demands, and when my money is entirely
expended, where is my dear mother to find
support
. Ah Meriel,
said
he, you
are always more anxious about her than
me, you don't care what becomes of your
father. I
should
think,
sir
,
said
I with
some
warmth, that I had given
sufficient
proof of my attention to the
happiness
of both.
I am
sorry
to
use
any language to a father,
which may be deemed improper; but I
must
say
, had you paid as much attention to
your own
happiness
as was undoubtedly
your duty, many of the afflictions, if not all
which have fallen upon our family, might
have been avoided. I will pay this money
sir
,
and I hope you will not think I take too
great a liberty if I
advise
you, hereafter to
shun
such
unworthy acquaintance as Dell,
and
strive
rather to obtain
some
genteel
employment
,
by which
these
kind of
scenes
may in future be avoided.
You talk like a very unfeeling girl,
Meriel,
said
he. Do you imagine then it
is
so
easy
for a man, born and brought up a
gentleman, to
submit
to the drudgery of
servitude
:
no
Miss
; if your ideas are
so
mean,
mine are not, I will
starve
first
, and would
rather
see
you
starve
than have my family
disgraced
by your following any
servile
,
mean employment. Believe me, Celia,
when he uttered
these
sentiments
, I felt
so
irritated by his
foolish
pride, that had not the
idea of my
suffering
mother at that moment
obtruded on my mind, I
should
have left him
to his fate. However, I
stifled
my
rising
anger
,
and having given him a draught on my
banker to
discharge
the
arrest
, returned to
console
my mother. When I entered, I was
surprised
to
see
her grief more violent than
ever. She was wringing her hands and
weeping
with great
bitterness
. After many
fruitless
enquiries concerning this
fresh
torrent
of
sorrow
, I learnt that Mr.
Lesage
, the
banker
,
with whom I had placed the trifling
remnant
of my fortune, was declared a bankrupt.
To
describe
my feelings is
impossible
.
However
I
saw
my mother wanted comfort, and I
exerted my
utmost
power to
stifle
emotions,
which if indulged, would only
serve
to
increase
her
anguish
.
We
must
go to
prison
,
said
she
, we
must
all go to
prison
, and who is to
support
us there? Providence, my dear mother,
said
I, We will place our hopes on that
benign
power, who never
forsakes
those
, who,
in full confidence of
support
, exert their
utmost
abilities and rely on him only for
success
. Come, come, chear up, thank God,
I am healthy and able to work. She
gazed
on me for a moment; then throwing
her arms round me,
she
cried, oh! my
child, I will doubt your virtue no longer;
your heart
must
be pure, or you could not
thus rely on heaven for
support
; but oh!
my dear Meriel, it will wound my heart
severely
to
see
you obliged to labour for
subsistence
.
Do not think of it,
said
I;
let me
see
you but tolerably happy and I
shall
not regret any
hardship
, however
severe
:
I will never leave you, my beloved
mother; only let me be once more called
the child of your affection, and I
shall
think
myself
completely rewarded for every
suffering
it may
please
heaven to inflict. A few
days after this, my father was removed to
this
miserable
place: we
sold
the
best
part
Vol. II. B
of our furniture and cloaths to
discharge
the
debts owing among our trades people. My
mother then came to my father: I do not
sleep
in the
prison
, but come here every
morning; I perform all their
domestic
offices
,
go out for their
provision
, &c. but as
yet, have not been able to procure any
work. Indeed, I had hope of being
employed
by an embroiderer, but on being
asked
to give
security
, for the
safety
of
whatever
work I might be
entrusted
with; I
unfortunately
happened to mention, being
related
to Mr.
Mossop
's family; of
course
, the
master
of the
shop
applied to my aunt for
my character. Celia, this aunt denied any
knowledge of me,
said
she
had no relation
who was in
circumstances
to want
employment
of that kind, that
she
had
some
knowledge
of a young woman of the name of
Howard,
she
believed, I might be very
honest
but I was certainly no relation of her's.
Thus my dear girl, was my laudable
design
frustrated
; for the man naturally
enough
observed
if I could be guilty of
telling
a lie; I might be capable of
worse
actions
.
I hope, however, in a
short
time to
procure
something
to do; for our little
stock
of money
diminishes
very
fast
.
August
15
th
, 1778.
Of all the
scenes
through which we are
doomed to
pass
,
sure
none is
so
truly
painful
,
as that of being
witness
to the death of
those
whom nature has placed in a near
relation
to us; whom,
spite
of all their errors,
we cannot wholly
divest
our hearts of
tenderness
for; and to
see
them approach the
awful confines of eternity in a frame of mind,
that renders all offered comfort ineffectual,
to calm their doubts and fears, when the
retrospect
of their
past
lives fills them only
with horror; and the idea of futurity brings
nothing but
despair
. Such a
scene
I have
lately
past
; my father is no more: he is I
hope at peace; to think
otherwise
would be
an agony too great to bear: poor man, to
the very
last
he was addicted to the fatal
errors that had undone him. Few were the
hours he
spent
in the apartment with my
mother, being chiefly at a place, which they
call the tap, where he could drown his care,
as he vainly imagined, and where he was
frequently drawn in to play cards, tho'
sometimes
for the
last
six
-pence he had in his
pocket.
One evening, at this place he quarrelled
with his
antagonist
, and high words
ensued
;
from words they went to blows, and my
father
recieved a
stroke
on his temple, which
leveled him with the ground. He fell with the
back of his head
against
an iron fender which
cut him
severely
and fractured the
skull
;
all
assistance
was vain; he
languished
four
days, in all the complicated agonies of pain
of body and
distress
of mind; tho' I flatter
myself
he had
some
internal comfort in his
last
moments, as he
seemed
more
composed
for about two hours before his death. He
earnestly
requested
forgiveness
of both my
mother and
myself
, for the manifold injuries
he had done us; but to my great comfort,
mentioned no particulars: he
also
made a
declaration before
witnesses
that the man
who
struck
the unfortunate blow, was
entirely
guiltless
of intentional malice, as he
had been the
first
aggressor
himself
; and
the fall was entirely accidental. He
expressed
a
wish
to
see
his
sister
; in compliance
with his
earnest
desire
I went to her, told
her of the melancholy accident, and
earnestly
requested
she
would
visit
my dying father.
Upon my word Meriel,
said
she
, I
am extremely
sorry
for this
shocking
affair;
but you know child my
seeing
him will be
of no
use
; it will only be hurting my own
feelings, with out being of the
least
service
to
your father. I never can bear
scenes
of this
kind; my
sensibility
is
so
exquisite
, that,
was I to
see
my poor brother in this
situation
,
I
should
not recover it for a month.
Ah! poor man, he was always getting into
some
mischief
or other; he never
prospered
in any thing after his marriage with your
mother.
You cannot
suppose
, madam, that the
want of
prosperity
was to be attributed to
that union.
Why, I don't know, Meriel, my
brother
never loved your mother, but was
artfully
drawn in. By whom, madam?
By your grand mother,
Miss
, who
wished
to get a good
settlement
for her
daughter
.
Your mother too, pretended
such
a
violent affection for him, that he could not
refuse
some
little return of
kindness
, and
they never
ceased
their arts till they had
noosed
him
fast
.
You talk in riddles, madam, my mother
brought my father a genteel fortune.
It was nothing,
Miss
, to the fortune
he might have expected, if he had not
offended
his father; I always
said
no good
would come of the match. It is much
to be
wished
, indeed, madam,
said
I,
that
such
a union never had taken place;
it would have
spared
my dear mother many
B 2
years of
severe
anguish
, and my unfortunate
self
would never have
seen
the light. As
I
said
this my heart was
so
oppressed
I could
not refrain my tears.
Bless
me! my dear,
said
Mrs.
Mossop
, in an affected accent of
kindness
; I did not mean to vex you,
you are not to be blamed for your parents
faults.
If they have faults, madam,
said
I,
be
assured
I
wish
not to hear of them; it
would be a painful topic at any time, but
pardon me, if I
say
, at this particular
season
,
it is a cruel one. I come to intreat you to
visit
a brother, who is poor and dying in
prison
. I
should
think, had he millions of
faults, at this moment they would be all
forgotten
;
that you would remember only his
afflictions, and that he was your brother.
I
spoke
this with
some
warmth; my aunt
hesitated
for an
answer
; at length
she
told
me
she
would come the next morning. It
will be too late, madam,
said
I, it is
thought he cannot live the night out.
Dear, dear,
she
replied, it is
so
unfortunate
that I have a large party coming
this afternoon, but if they leave me in any
tolerable
season
I would hear no more,
but turning from her with a mixture of
contempt
and pity, I returned to the habitation
of mourning and death. When I entered
the room, my father enquired eagerly if
she
would come; I thought it would be wrong
to
disturb
his
last
moments, with an account
of her unfeeling conduct, I therefore only
told him,
she
was not able to come that
evening, but would be there early in the
morning. It will be too late then,
said
he,
I
must
write to her. It was in vain we
remonstrated
; he would be
raised
in the
bed, with a
design
to write; but his head
would not permit him to trace even a
single
letter: he was
seized
with faintings and
when he recovered
seemed
to have forgot
his
design
. He
spoke
but little afterwards,
was wholly taken up in prayer: tho' he
frequently cried out in agony, 'tis all in
vain, I cannot be forgiven. A worthy
well
disposed
clergyman prayed
besided
him,
and
said
a great deal to
compose
him, and
calm his doubts. It had in
some
measure
the
desired
effect: and about four o'clock
in the morning, he
resigned
his
soul
into
the hand of Him who gave it.
My mother's
sorrow
is not to be
described
.
All thought of our dreadful,
desolate
situation
was entirely
absorbed
in this heavy
affliction. I did not attempt to interrupt
her grief, as I thought, if
suffered
to take
its natural
course
, time would meliorate a
sorrow
, which, any attempt at
present
to
soften
, would but
increase
. In the
course
of the next day, we expected my aunt to
make the
promised
visit
; but as the day
passed
without
seeing
her, in the evening my
mother
desired
me to go to her again, and
inform him of our
loss
. I went, but was
suffered
to wait near an hour, before
she
appeared
;
nor did my
cousins
come near me,
tho' I heard them laughing and talking in
the next room. Ah!
said
I, mentally, the
afflicted are never admitted chearfully; they
are left to indulge their own
sad
thoughts
in
solitude
. Cruel
Hester
and
Susan
, had you
been in affliction, would not I have abridged
my own
pleasures
to comfort and
console
you.
When my aunt entered the room
she
began;
realy Meriel I have not been able to
visit
my brother before; but now I have half an
hour to
spare
, I will
send
for a coach, and
we will go together. Your
visit
will no
doubt be acceptable to my mother, dear
madam,
said
I, but my father is no
longer
in a
situation
.
He is dead then, cried
she
eagerly.
I bowed my head in
silence
.
Well, continued
she
, I rather
expected
it, and I am much obliged to you for
calling, to let me know, as I
should
have
been greatly
shocked
to have found him
dead, when I had called, as I certainly
should
,
either this evening or to-morrow morning.
My mother bid me
ask
your advice
concerning
the funeral madam, and not only
your advice, but your
assistance
.
Assistance
, for what child?
Could you advance us a little money?
Money,
Miss
Howard! You
astonish
me; it is
impossible
you can be in want of
money, when you came to
possession
of
so
handsome
a fortune within
these
two years.
I am very
sorry
madam, that you can
suppose
me capable of
suffering
my parents
to
languish
in
prison
for fifty pounds, if I
could have commanded
such
a
sum
.
Why as to that Meriel, I thought you
were acting like a prudent girl, and meant
to take care of
yourself
; for I know you
paid a great deal of money for your father,
and might have continued
so
doing till you
had ruined
yourself
.
I
should
certainly have paid this
last
debt, madam, had not the failure of Mr.
Lesage
put it entirely out of my power.
Oh I remember hearing, that you
lost
six
hundred pounds by his failure, but you
surely
had a larger
sum
by you than that.
Indeed aunt, that
six
hundred pounds
was all the dependence I had in the world.
Upon my word Meriel, I never was
more
astonished
in my life. How have you
contrived to run thro' all that money. Your
mother and
yourself
must
have been very
extravagant
,
and when that is the
case
, nothing
will
save
people from ruin. I am very
sorry
child, very
sorry
; but it is not in my
power
to help you; I have a large family, and
the education of my daughters is
expensive
.
As to my poor brother, why, my advice is,
that you have him buried as privately, and
with as little
expense
as
possible
. You will
remember me to your mother; tell her I
am really concerned at her trouble; but it
is entirely out my power to help her, nor
indeed, do I think it would be of any
use
;
for was
she
releived from
these
difficulties,
she
would
soon
be involved by her
imprudence
,
in others of the
same
sort
.
When I repeated this
conversation
to my
mother,
she
said
, it is no more than I
expected
,
my dear child; but I let you go to
make trial of her heart, that you might be
convinced, how little dependence is to be
placed on
professions
of
friendship
, made to
us in our
prosperity
; and how little
assistance
is to be hoped from relations. We
will
sell
every valuable of our cloaths and
plate, to lay your father decently in the
ground, and to pay the debt for which I
now am become liable. It will, I am
certain
,
leave us
almost
destitute
; but when
we have our liberty, we can perhaps gain
employment of
some
kind or other, I will
not mind how abject; for I would rather
hardly earn, or indeed beg my bread from
strangers
, than be
subject
to the
unkindness
of haughty, unfeeling relations.
This
resolution
was immediately
executed
,
and when all expences were
discharged
,
we found
ourselves
possessed
of five
guineas,
some
trifling
household
furniture,
and the
meanest
of our cloaths. With
these
we left that abode of
misery
, the Fleet
prison
,
and have taken a cheap lodging, on
the Surry
side
of Blackfriars bridge. I have
endeavoured to get
some
work, but as yet
without effect; and what adds to my
uneasiness
,
is, that my dear mother's health
daily declines. As I have no other
amusement
,
I
spend
a good deal of time at my
pen. I have wrote
several
little poems,
which I intend to correct and offer to
some
bookseller
. Perhaps by that means, I may
obtain
something
towards our
subsistance
.
I feel a
transient
ray of hope dawn upon my
mind. My mother
smiling
, tells me, I am
too
sanguine
; but my dear Celia, I always
was inclined to take the
brightest
side
of
the
prospect
, to hope for the
best
, and when
disappointment
arrives, to
submit
with as
much patience as I can. I am what is
generally
termed a
castle
builder; it is a
weakness
(if it
deserves
the appellation) from
which I derive
amusement
at
least
, and tho'
I know at the very moment I am indulging
those
sanguine
ideas, that my hopes have
no more foundation, than the bubble blown
from the pipe of a playful boy; yet I
cannot
help being
pleased
with the airy fabric
of my own creating, and as
soon
as one
vanishes
,
(to continue the
allusion
) I puff out
another, and
so
prevent
myself
from
becoming
a prey to
despair
. And, believe
me Celia, I
consider
this
disposition
, as one
of the
choicest
gifts of heaven. Adieu my
friend; may you be happier than your
MERIEL.
LETTER XXVII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
December
5
th
, 1778.
It
is now
some
months
since
I have taken
up my pen to
address
my dear Celia.
Several times lately I have
essayed
to do it,
but unable to bear a
retrospect
of my late
heavy affliction, have from time to time,
deferred
the painful recital, till I begin to fear
my dear friend will think I am either
numbered
with the dead, or become forgetful of
her
friendship
. I have a long tale to tell my
dear girl, a tale, which I fear, will
steal
many
a tear from your eyes as you
peruse
it. In my
last
I informed you of my mother's ill health,
and how unable we were to procure any
proper
advice or
assistance
. From that time her
malady daily
increased
. I
finished
my little
collection of poems and
presented
them to a
bookseller
; but he told me, I had
mistaken
my talents, and that the whole collection was
Vol. II. C
not worth a guinea.
Disheartened
and
dispirited
I returned to my mother, and now gave
up my whole time to watching and
attending
her. Her
disorder
increased
with
such
rapidity, that in the
course
of a few weeks
she
was
consined
to her bed. What a
prospect
had I now before me, a beloved parent
sinking
by
slow
degrees into the grave; when
I had no method of procuring the comforts,
and even the
necessaries
of life were denied.
I had parted with all our apparel, except a
change of linen, and had now
past
one whole
day without food. My mother made no
complaints; but her pale wan countenance,
was to me a
thousand
times more affecting
than unavailing exclamations. Our credit
had been long
lost
in the neighbourhood,
and I knew that in a few days we
must
inevitably
perish
for want. In this
situation
, I
took a
resolution
to go out in the
close
of the
evening and
solicit
the charity of the
benevolent
.
I told my tale of
sorrow
to many of
my own
sex
. They either heard me not, or
disbelieved
my
assertions
, and after
sauntering
through the
streets
near three hours, one
cold wet night in October, I at length
collected
about
six
-pence, and with it having
procured
some
trifling
nourishment
for my
almost
famished
parent, I returned, allowing
myself
only a halfpenny roll. When I
carried
my little
morsel
to her
bedside
,
she
anxiously
enquired how I had procured it.
Some charitable
disposed
person
,
said
I,
gave me the means; take it my mother,
eat and be comforted.
Sinking nature required
support
;
she
eat
the offered
morsel
, but
seasoned
it with tears
of heartfelt
anguish
.
The next day I determined again to try
my new employment, and for that
purpose
wandered out towards the park. It was
Sunday
,
the day was fine, I went in and
seating
myself
on a bench, looked at the gay throng
that crowded the mall, compared their
situations
with my own, and began to think
myself
the
most
unfortunate of human beings.
I knew I had never deviated from the path
of virtue; I had never committed any
action
deserving
such
abject
misery
, and I
saw
many women who had forfeited all claim to
honour and
respect
, enjoying all the luxuries
of life. At that moment
reason
, religion,
integrity
forsook
me; and I
wished
myself
in
the
same
situation
with
those
victims to vice,
if by
so
doing, I could procure
sustenance
for
my mother.
You will, perhaps
ask
, my dear Celia, if
we had no friends whatever, to whom we
could apply for relief; alas! my dear girl, you
know nothing of the world;
those
who have
drank deep of the cup of affliction can tell,
that poverty and
friendship
are utter
strangers
to each other. While I was indulging
these
painful reflections, an elderly
gentlewoman
,
seated
herself
beside
me, and
viewing
my
person
and
dress
with a
scrutinizing
eye, began
some
trifling
discourse
, and at
length
asked
me, if I was born in London.
From chatting at
first
on indifferent
subjects
,
we began to remark the different
appearances
of the
passing
multitude. The old lady's
remarks were
just
and pertinent; her
discourse
breathed the true
spirit
of
philanthropy
.
I imagined I had found a friend, and
without
reserve
unbosomed
myself
to her;
related my
story
of
past
and
present
distress
;
she
heard me with attention, and, me
thought, I
saw
a gleam of
compassion
pass
across
her features. I
seized
the propitious
moment, and in the
humblest
accent
petitioned
relief.
Poor child,
said
she
, I believe your
story
to be true; innocence and
simplicity
,
are indeliably marked upon your
countenance
;
what is in my power I will do for
you, tho' the means are but
small
. She
then drew forth her
purse
, and
presented
me with half a crown: it is only for
those
who have been in
similar
circumstances
to
concieve the tide of joy that
rushed
upon
my heart at the
possession
of this little piece
of
silver
; I eagerly
kissed
the hand that
conveyed it to me, and would have
spoke
,
but tears were the only thanks I could
return
;
they were the
sincerest
, for they came
warm from the heart.
I left my
seat
with precipitation, and was
preparing to return home; but my
benefactress
stopped
me.
Miss
Howard,
said
she
, I believe I have it my power to
serve
you; meet me here again to-morrow. I
promised
to meet her and returned to my
mother with a heart lightened of half its
sorrows
. No doubt,
said
I, this lady will
endeavour to extricate us from our
present
distress
, and put us in
some
way of earning
future
subsistance
.
Elated with
these
hopes, I repaired next
day to the appointed place; but after
having
waited two hours was obliged to return
without
seeing
my
benefactress
. Something
has detained her unexpectedly,
said
I,
she
will undoubtedly come to-morrow: but
to-morrow
passed
as
yesterday
had done, and I
was again
disappointed
.
The third morning, tho' I had
used
the
most
rigid economy, I found
myself
again
pennyless
.
C 2
However,
spiritless
and
miserable
as I
was, I determined once more to repair to the
park. My pace was
slow
, my looks dejected
and my eyes
streaming
with tears. I had
hardly proceeded half the length of the mall,
when I heard
myself
called, and turning
round perceived my
benefactress
.
My good girl,
said
she
, I
almost
feared I
should
not meet you, I have been
obliged to go into the country
since
I
saw
you,
but I had not forgot you; come dry your
eyes, I have met with a gentleman who will
be your friend, if you mind how you behave
yourself
. He has
sent
you half a guinea;
and if you will come this evening and
sup
at
my
house
, in Soho
square
, I will introduce
you to him.
Alas! madam,
said
I, my
appearance
at your
house
will only
disgrace
you;
nor can I
suppose
any gentleman will greatly
interest
himself
in behalf of a poor
unfortunate
girl, without requiring a return which
virtue and religion will not
suffer
me to
make.
Don't be
foolish
, child,
said
the old
lady, virtue and religion are very pretty
words; but pray tell me, will they keep your
mother from
starving
.
Oh! madam, I replied, will it not be
worse
than death to brand her name with
infamy
?
Alas! I never could bear the
scorn
of the world, and the reproofs of my own
conscience
,
oppressed
with guilt and
shame
.
Tempt me not, dear madam, to
forsake
the
path of rectitude; let me retain my
innocence
,
and come what may, I
shall
die in
peace.
This is fine talking,
Miss
Howard, but
let me tell you, it is a very
selfish
way of
arguing
.
You acknowledge, that the
loss
of
virtue would make you unhappy. Are you
not already unhappy in a
superlative
degree;
and does that
unhappiness
in the
least
contribute
to relieve your own or your mother's
wants. No, does not the
sight
of your
misery
rather
increase
hers? Come, then, my
dear girl, act the heroine, take this load of
sorrow
upon
yourself
, and
save
a parent,
whom you tenderly love, from
perishing
with
famine.
This was a
strange
way of arguing, Celia,
yet it had the
desired
effect, I thought it was
possible
to hide my infamy from my mother,
and confine my
misery
to my own
bosom
.
When the old woman found my
resolution
began to waver,
she
plied me with
sophistical
arguments,
described
in glowing colours
the gaiety and
splendor
in which many
women
of
loose
characters lived, and
contrasted
it
strongly
with my poor
miserable
apartment
,
where my
sure
attendants were
pinching
cold and hunger, and my only companion
a beloved parent
sinking
under the
complicated
evils of
sickness
and famine.
Oh!
save
me!
save
me! cried I
eagerly
,
from the dreadful thought, teach
me how to
snatch
her from impending
destruction
,
to
administer
support
to her
wasting
frame, and comfort her declining hours.
Do with me as you will;
save
, protect my
dear mother, and let me be the only
sacrifice
.
Having brought me to this horrible
resolution
,
and received my
promise
of coming
to her
house
in the evening;
she
left me,
and I repaired home; by the way procuring
a bottle of wine and
some
other
necessaries
for my mother. She had been anxious at
my long
stay
, and when I produced the
refreshments
,
again enquired how I had
purchased
them. A lie, (the
sirst
I had ever
told her) now
suggested
itself
; I
said
I had
performed a little work for a lady in the
neighbourhood, and
she
had liberally
rewarded
me; but when I mentioned going
out again in the evening, the pathetic
manner
in which
she
intreated me to guard my
honour, as my only
treasure
, and as I
wished
to
preserve
her heart from breaking,
almost
staggered
my
resolution
: but having
given her
some
refreshment
, I
saw
her
spirits
revive, and that by degrees
she
sunk
into
a
sweet
refreshing
slumber
. I determined
to
sacrifice
every other
consideration
rather
than
see
her reduced again to the extremity
of
misery
she
had
so
lately experienced.
Oh! ye rigidly virtuous of my own
sex
,
turn not from me with horror and contempt,
consider
my agonizing
distress
, glance with
an eye of
compassion
over the dreadful
resolution
,
and let a tear of pity blot the offence
from your memories.
Great and painful were the
struggles
of
my
soul
, while gazing on my
sleeping
parent
.
I knelt by the
bedside
, and would
have prayed, but, alas! that
consolation
was
denied me. How could I
address
a Being
of infinite purity, when I was going to offer
myself
a
sacrifice
at the
shrine
of guilt and
pollution. I thought I
should
have
sunk
under
the agonies I endured; once I
wished
for death, but then the thought of what my
poor mother would
suffer
, immediately
repelled
the impious
desire
; at length, I
clasped
my hands and
raising
my eyes to
heaven
,
cried, Father of mercy direct me, oh!
give me fortitude to bear thy
dispensations
as I ought, or pardon the
weakness
of an
afflicted mortal. I then
kissed
my
sleeping
mother, and with a heart
almost
broken
repaired
to Soho.
The old woman received me cordially, but
reproved my
pensive
countenance and
swolen
eyes;
she
made me drink
some
tea, and
then taking me up
stairs
,
insisted
on my
dressing
myself
in a brown
lutestring
nightgown
,
with a cap and linen
suitable
. We
then went into an elegant parlour, and in a
few moments Mr. Welldon was announced:
he was a man upwards of thirty, of a
comely
person
, polite
address
, and
insinuating
manner; he regarded me with
visible
attention
,
and when he
spoke
to me, it was with
a mixture of
respect
and polite freedom.
My feelings during
supper
were beyond
description
,
poignant: I could
scarcely
restrain
my tears, but the reproving looks of the
old woman told me how much they would
offend her: I therefore endeavoured to
stisle
my emotions; but when the cloth was
removed
and
she
arose
to quit the room, I
involuntarily
caught her hand, and with a look
which pleaded
strongly
for
compassion
burst
into tears.
Why, what does the girl cry for?
said
she
sneeringly
, was it not by your own
desire
you came here? come, Mr. Welldon, you
must
get the better of
these
pretty airs, tho'
perhaps, indeed you may think her the more
agreeable for them. Then
disengaging
her
hand from my
grasp
,
she
left the room.
Then I am inevitably
lost
, cried I,
clasping
my hands in a wild agony, and
redoubling
my tears. My
sweet
girl,
said
Mr. Welldon, this
distress
, which is too
acute, to be
construed
into affectation,
greatly
suprises
me. Was it not by your own
free will that you came here to meet me?
It was, it was,
said
I, but oh!
sir
, if
you only knew the
anguish
it has
cost
me,
to form the horrid
design
, you would pity
me, indeed you would
commiserate
my
sufferings
.
Dear creature,
said
he, drawing his
chair
close
to mine, you know not how
greatly your
sorrow
interests
me; tell me,
is there any thing within the
compass
of my
fortune, can
restore
peace to your agitated
bosom
;
say
how can I
serve
you, how
render
you happy?
Oh! there is one way, and only one
way,
said
I, by which you can promote
my
happiness
, and I dropped on my knees
before him.
Rise
,
rise
, my dear girl,
said
he, and do not
hesitate
to point out
this only way, by which I can prove
myself
your friend.
This humliating
posture
best
suits
me,
I replied, here will I remain till I move
your heart to
compassion
: indeed I am not
that vile creature you may perhaps think
me. I always avoided the inticements of
vice till this fatal night; but the
miseries
of
a beloved parent,
sinking
to the grave,
oppressed
by
sickness
and poverty drove me
to
sacrifice
my honour, to procure the
means of prolonging her invaluable
existence
:
if you are
sincere
in your
professions
of
friendship
, relieve my dear mother, and
oh! I
besceeh
you,
spare
the virtue of her
wretched daughter.
Rise
, then, my afflicted girl,
said
he,
you
shall
be convinced of my
sincerity
; I
will obey the dictates of humanity; we will
instantly
go to your mother. He then left
me for a few moments, when returning, he
led me to a coach, and taking my direction,
ordered the coachman to drive to our poor
habitation. I
hesitated
at going away in the
cloaths the old woman had made me put on,
but my deliverer told me he had paid for
them.
When we arrived at our lodging, a
mixed
sensation
of pain and
pleasure
dwelt upon
my mind, and as I ran up
stairs
my limbs
trembled
so
, they would
scarce
support
me;
Mr. Welldon followed me up: I opened
the door of the apartment, and
rushing
to
the
bedside
, cried
see
my dear mother,
the friend which heaven hath
sent
us. My
poor mother
raised
herself
feebly in the bed,
looked
first
at me, then at Mr. Welldon, then
pointing to my altered
dress
and crying
these
are the wages of infamy, all but this I could
have born patiently. She fell back in a fit.
I thought
she
was gone forever; frantic
with
despair
, I tore off the
dress
which had
so
much alarmed her, and throwing
myself
on
the bed
beside
her, vowed never more to
rise
,
but that my life
should
expiate my
intended
offence. Mr. Welldon had ran away for
medical
assistance
, and entered the room
with an apothecary,
just
as my mother gave
some
signs
of returning life. Proper
remedies
were immediately applied and Mr.
Welldon
soon
convinced my reviving parent,
that I had not entailed infamy on her latter
days, or
hastened
the period of her
existence
by guilt or
shame
.
Vol. II. D
Our generous benefactor, now
supplied
me with money, not only to procure every
necessary
, but every comfort of life; and
engaged the apothecary to attend my
mother
every day: but his care was all in
vain; her
disorder
daily gained ground, and
I
saw
her end rapidly approaching. One
day, when Mr. Welldon called to
see
us, my
mother beckoned him to the
bedside
. Sir,
said
she
, if the prayers of a poor dying
mortal are heard in heaven, you will
undoubtedly
be rewarded for your
benevolence
,
towards a
helpless
widow and orphan.
To your
generosity
I owe the honour of my
child: oh! may
she
never again be
tempted
to doubt the care of a watchful
providence
;
and to avoid a temporary evil,
rush
into
lasting
misery
. To your care Mr.
Welldon
I commit her, poor and
defenceless
as
she
is; I do not fear your integrity; for the
man, who in the gay hour of uncontrouled
passion
could
save
an innocent creature from
destruction
, will never lay a deliberate plan
for her
seduction
. Meriel, you
must
be
humble and
industrious
, and
trust
heaven
for
support
. Mr. Welldon
promised
he
would be my guardian and protector from
every evil. I place an implicit confidence
in your word,
said
my mother, and
shall
die in peace.
Oh! my dear Meriel, continued
she
,
faintly
grasping
my hand,
mayst
thou be
virtuous and happy, and may the
Omnipotent
preserve
thee thro' life.
Celia, I feel I am unable to proceed, the
moment that
severed
me from my dear
mother
will be always remembered as the
most
painful of my life. Adieu till I am more
composed
.
MERIEL.
LETTER XXVIII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
December
25
th
, 1778.
I again
sit
down to proceed in my
melancholy
narrative; a month from the
time of my dear mother's death
must
be
passed
over in
silence
; my affliction was
poignant
,
but time and the efforts of
reason
by
degrees
softened
it. Mr. Welldon
suffered
that time to
elapse
before he ventuted to
see
me; he had placed me with a friend of
his, who is a milliner, and tho' he
sent
every day to enquire after my health, he
avoided
visiting
me, fearing the
censure
of
the world might injure my reputation. My
grief being in a great
measure
abated, Mrs.
Lacour took an opportunity of
speaking
to
me concerning my future
prospects
in life:
Mr. Welldon,
said
she
, intends, if you
approve the plan, that you
shall
remain with
me till you have attained a competent
knowledge
of the millinery
business
, to be able to
support
yourself
without being any longer
troublesome
to your benefactor. I know,
Miss
Howard, continued
she
, that Mr.
Welldon does not think you an
incumbrance
,
and that you are in no danger of
any improper attempts from him; as I have
heard him
say
the innate
goodness
of your
heart has
raised
you
so
in his
esteem
, that he
regards you in the light of a
sister
; and as
such
will
serve
and protect you: but my
dear young lady, you are
possessed
of
strong
sensibility
and to
such
a heart as your's
dependance
must
be a heavy burthen. As
another motive for your endeavouring to
render
yourself
independent, I
must
inform
you that Mr. Welldon will in a few weeks
be married, and however innocent your
mind, believe me the world will readily
cast
illiberal
censures
on a young woman who
lived in a
state
of dependance on a married
man; and
should
it reach his lady's ears
might be the
source
of great
uneasiness
, if
not the
cause
of an irreparable breach
between
them.
I was convinced of the propriety of
these
arguments, and chearfully
acquiesced
, while
my heart overflowed with gratitude towards
my generous benefactor, and I breathed a
silent
prayer to heaven, that his felicity in
D 2
the married
state
might be equal to his
deserts
.
A few days after this, Mr. Welldon
called
.
I could not refrain my tears at
sight
of
this worthy man.
Past
scenes
of
sorrow
rushed
upon my mind, which joined to the
recollection of my then forlorn, dependant
situation
almost
overcame me. He
suffered
me to
ease
my full heart, and then gently
enquiring after my health, and how I liked
Mrs. Lacour's family, hinted at my
remaining
with her, till I had attained a competent
knowledge of her
business
.
I know, my dear
Miss
Howard,
said
he, that your education and
accomplishments
fit you to be placed in a more elevated
sphere
. But my good girl
must
consider
that
those
accomplishments
in her
present
circumstances
will be of no
use
. Nay, if
they are
suffered
to appear will only excite
the envy and ill nature of
those
with whom
she
is at
present
obliged to
associate
. I would
by no means have you neglect
those
brilliant
talents, with which nature has endowed you.
It is not to be doubted, but you will find
leisure
hours when the pen or the pencil will be
a happy relief to your mind, and prevent
your dwelling too intently on
past
melancholy
events. But let
those
hours of relaxation
be but few, above all things, be
careful
not to let your companions
discover
the
superiority
you certainly
possess
over them.
Educated, as you have been, perhaps you
may think, that with great propriety you
might undertake the education of children in
some
family of
distinction
, or become
companion
to
some
lady. I acknowledge, my
fair friend,
these
are the
situations
for which
you
seem
most
adapted, but here an
insurmountable
obstacle
arises
you have no
female
friend who can recommend you; and
the recommendation of a man, in
these
cafes,
in general injures the
person
they mean to
serve
. You
must
, therefore, apply
yourself
attentively to your new
profession
, and place
a firm reliance on Providence to reward your
industry
with
success
."
I had never attempted to interrupt Mr.
Welldon, during this friendly harrangue, but
finding he now continued
silent
, I
endeavoured,
as well as my tears would permit, to
convince him of my gratitude, by
promising
to do every thing which he had enjoined.
Mrs. Lacour was now
desired
to come in,
when all terms having been previously agreed
on, he paid my apprentice fee, and it was
determined I
should
remain with her twelve
months. Mr. Welldon then told me he had
provided me an apartment to
myself
, and
begged my acceptance of the furniture it
contained. This day three weeks,
Miss
Howard,
said
he, will make me the
happiest
of men in a union with a young lady
of great merit, on whom I have
deservedly
placed my affections. We
shall
set
off
immediately
on a
visit
to the continent to
see
some
relations, who
reside
constantly
in the
south
of France,
so
that it may be a long
time before I
see
you again. In this little
pocket-book you will find a trifle to
answer
your immediate expences, and a direction
to a gentleman, in the city, where in
case
of
any future exigencies, you may apply, and he
will give you both
assistance
and advice.
God
bless
you, my dear girl; you have my
best
wishes
, and may
rest
assured
of my
unalterable
friendship
. He then
saluted
me
with the affection of a brother, and took his
leave.
Soon after he was gone, Mrs. Lacour,
by way of diverting my mind from the gloom
our parting had
cast
over it,
asked
me if I
had no
curiosity
to
see
the apartment Mr.
Welldon had
furnished
for me. I followed
her up two pair of
stairs
, into a neat back
room, where was a tent bed, of
striped
Manchester
,
with every
necessary
apurtenance,
a
case
of drawers, a neat
dressing
case
, and
a
small
trunk, the key of which Mrs.
Lacour
gave me, and bidding me with a
smile
examine my
treasures
, went down
stairs
.
On opening the trunk I found it contained
a piece of grey
lutestring
, two pieces of dark
chintz, each enough for a gown, about ten
yards of
muslin
, and a piece of fine linen.
Removing
these
, I
discovered
at the bottom,
a neat edition of the
English
poets, together
with a bible and common prayer book; here
also
, I found a roll of drawing paper, which
led me to imagine I was
supplied
with other
materials for this elegant
amusement
, and on
opening the drawers, I found I had not been
deceived in my conjectures; for there I
found a box of crayons, pencils and colours,
and a leather writing
case
, in which was a
letter of truely brotherly advice. On
opening
a light
closet
that adjoined my bed
chamber
,
I
discovered
another mark of the
friendly
attention of my benefactor; for there
was a
small
piano forte, with a collection of
music
by the
best
masters
. My little
pocket-book
contained a bank note for fifty pounds.
Oppressed
by a
sense
of
these
numerous
obligations, my heart
almost
bursting
with
grateful emotions, I
sunk
on my knees by
the bed
side
, and poured forth my thanks
to the great
Disposer
of all things,
entreated
that the
choicest
of his
blessings
might
be
showered
on my benefactor, and prayed
his mercy ever to protect and direct me,
nor
suffer
me again,
impiously
to doubt his
power and watchful care.
The next morning, I entered on my new
employment with alacrity. It is an
employment
that keeps the mind continually
amufed
.
Mrs. Lacour is an amiable, chearful
woman, and
some
of her young people,
sensible
,
well informed girls. I do not like
Mr. Lacour: he appears to me a pert,
illiterate
coxcomb. But this does not give me
any great
uneasiness
, as I am not much in
his company, except at meal times. When
the
business
of the day is
finished
, I retire to
my own apartment, where writing, reading
or
music
,
sweetly
relaxes and chears my
mind: the time never hangs heavy; I feel
a charming
serenity
pervade my heart, and
Hope, that bright
celestial
guest
, again has
taken up her
residence
in my
bosom
. On
a Sundy evening, I never fail
visiting
the
dear
spot
, that contains all that was earthly
of my beloved mother. I cannot
describe
my
sensations
when I approach the place.
They are far from painful Celia, for the
remembrance of her piety and virtue is a
balm to my heart; and while my eye is
fixed on the grave where
she
lies, my mental
faculties behold her
blessed
spirit
beatified
,
and enjoying the
fullness
of heavenly
bliss
in that
mansion
, where, I
trust
, I
shall
one day again embrace her. When I
return
from
these
contemplations, my
soul
is
so
attuned to harmony, that I
sing
the hymns
or anthems
suited
to the day, with a
pleasure
undescribable
. I have wrote a few
lines, which you will find fully
expressive
of the frame of my mind. I cannot help
regreting, my
dearest
friend, the happy
days I
spent
with you in the convent, tho'
all-chearing Hope bids me look forward;
and while I take my
present
lot with
gratitude
,
humbly
aspire
to a
blessed
hereafter.
Enclosed
are the lines I mention; I
sing
it
to that
sweet
plaintive air, we were both
so
fond of. I
shall
sometimes
please
myself
with the thought, that we may perhaps after
you have received this, both
sing
it at the
same
moment. God
bless
you my dear
Celia.
MERIEL.
TO HOPE.
OH!
cease
, vain
busy
fancy
cease
To dwell on
scenes
long
past
,
When every hour was wing'd with peace,
With joy too great to
last
.
But come,
sweet
Hope,
celestial
pow'r,
Thy healing comfort bring;
Oh
sooth
my mind, and let me
soar
Upon thine airy wing.
When thro' the vaulted
aisle
I roam,
And breath the
sigh
sincere
,
Or o'er my mother's hallowed tomb
Drop the
sad
filial tear:
'Tis thou
canst
chear the
solemn
hour,
Canst
peace and comfort bring,
Elate my thoughts, and bid them
soar
,
Upon thine airy wing.
Methinks I hear thee
whisp
'ring
say
;
Mortal, thy tears give o'er,
Thy mother, thou in realms of day,
Shalt meet to part no more.
Sooth'd by thy words, benignant power,
My
soul
exulting
springs
,
And tow'rd the
sky
, with rapture
soars
Upon thine airy wings.
LETTER XXIX.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
January
10
th
, 1779.
There
is in this family a
Mademoiselle
Bagatelle, who is Mrs. Lacour's
forewoman
;
I do not like her, Celia,
she
dresses
in the extremity of the
fashion
, takes
snuff
,
rouges high, and is high in the good graces
of
Monsieur
Lacour. I can percieve they
perfectly
understand
each other, tho' the
prudent wife either does not, or will not,
see
the intimacy that
subsists
between them.
It has often been a
subject
of wonder to
me, how people,
whose
tempers and
dispositions
are the very
reverse
of each other,
could voluntarily put on the hymeneal yoke
together; and yet we daily
see
instances
of
sense
and folly; virtue and vice;
understanding
and ignorance;
politeness
and
vulgarity
;
youth and age; beauty and
deformity
,
Vol. II. E
being linked in the
same
chain: nay,
what is more
surprising
that both parties
eagerly put it on. How are we to account
for
these
inconsistencies
in human nature,
nothing can be more
opposite
than the
dispositions
of
Monsieur
and Mrs. Lacour, and
yet I have been told that it was a marriage
of inclination and on the lady's
side
, entirely
against
the approbation of her friends;
hence we
must
suppose
, that either love
throws a
mist
over the
discerning
optics of
its votaries, or that their is a fate in
marriage
,
which it is
impossible
to counteract.
You will, perhaps, wonder, my dear
Celia
,
that among the many long
epistles
I
have lately wrote to you, the name of
Rainsforth
has never
escaped
me: indeed, I have
had afflictions of
so
much heavier a nature,
than merely the
loss
of a lover, that
some
months
passed
in which I hardly remembered
there was
such
a
person
in being: however
in my
present
situation
, being more
easy
in
my mind, thought has frequently recurred
to the period when I expected to have been
united to him by
indissoluble
ties. When I
think of him, I am feelingly convinced that
my heart is
still
attached; I
almost
doubt
the intelligence of his infidelity, tho'
conveyed
to me by the hand of his father: I feel
a
restless
curiosity
to be informed of his
happiness
; I fancy,
sometimes
that he might
have heard reports to my
disadvantage
; he
might have been informed of my
unfortunate
elopement, of my
thoughtless
correspondence
with Pringle: every
circumstance
may have been exaggerated; and he may not
be
so
culpable as I at
first
thought him.
These
ideas often crowd my imagination.
But he is married, Celia, and let his virtues
be ever
so
briliant, he can be nothing to me.
I have heard by mere accident that my
brother is in a fair way of making his
fortune
in India; I have wrote to him
several
times, but recieved no
answer
; not even
a line has arrived from him,
since
the bill,
which I mentioned in a former letter, was
paid. Mr.
Mossop
's family are I find removed
into the country, and as to any of
those
who called
themselves
my friends in the day
of
prosperity
, if I meet them now they
stare
me confidently in the face, but do not in the
least
recollect me. Mrs. Lacour, tells me,
that when fortune removes friends to any
considerable
distance
from each other, the
party who is the favourite of the fickle
goddess
almost
immediately becomes
near-fighted
,
and is afflicted with a
short
memory.
January
19
th
.
I was
yesterday
sent
to wait on a lady with
some
caps, &c. in St. James's
square
. When
having waited about half an hour in a cold
empty parlour, I thought I heard a voice
that was familiar to my ears, but could not
recollect
whose
it was. I was
striving
to call
it to my memory in vain, when the door
opened, and who
should
I behold but
Miss
Pringle, and another young lady. Come
into this room young woman,
said
she
,
here is a fire, and we will look over your
trumpery. I went in my heart
sinking
as
I moved; for I knew enough of this once
affectionate friend to
suppose
she
would not
readily acknowledge an acquaintance with
a milliner's apprentice. I
saw
, the moment
she
cast
her eyes on me,
she
recollected
me; but as I did not
wish
to
shew
an
inclination
to renew our acquaintance, I
cast
down my eyes and remained
silent
,
thinking
that if
she
did not
choose
to take notice of
me,
she
might
settle
it within
herself
that I
did not know her. But the lady's
curiosity
was more predominent than her pride. She
looked at me
several
times and at length
cried if I did not think it
almost
impossible
I
should
say
your name was Howard.
My name is Howard, ma'am,
said
I
coldly
.
Why,
sure
as I am alive, it is Meriel
Howard. The very
same
,
Miss
Pringle.
La! my dear girl, why how came you in
this
situation
,
such
a fortune as you had left
you. We are all
subject
to
vicissitudes
of fortune,
said
I
smiling
, but I am
extremely
happy in my
present
situation
.
Happy!
said
she
, lifting up her eyes in
surprize
. I am
astonished
to hear you
say
so
, for my part I
should
be the
most
miserable
creature on earth, was I reduced to
carry
a band-box.
Happiness
and
misery
,
Miss
,
said
I, are in general the
result
of
our own ideas: if I am content in my
humble
station
, I am in my own mind as happy,
nay, perhaps happier than the woman, who
riding in a chariot and pair, envies one
whose
superior
fortune can command four or
six
horses
.
She did not
seem
to comprehend me, but
turning to the other lady,
said
, well I vow
sister
it is very
astonishing
; but this young
woman, only four years ago, had a fortune
of four
thousand
pounds, her father
lived
in the neighbourhood of our
country-houe
.
My brother was very fond of her
once, and I believe
she
did not altogether
dislike
him, did you Meriel? I fancy your
little heart never regained its liberty.
E 2
I rather
suppose
,
Miss
Pringle, that it
never was a captive. If at one time I was
foolish
enough to fancy
myself
in love with
your brother, it was before I had the power
of
distinguishing
a real from an ideal
passion
,
or before I was a competent judge of what
would be
most
conducive to my own
happiness
.
Aye,
said
she
, you can talk of it with
a great deal of
composure
now, but you
certainly
was very fond of him once or you would
not have
resolved
to run away with him;
nay, can you deny that you were out of your
senses
about him, when you heard he was
married.
This cruel reflection on my unfortunate
malady, which was
occasioned
by the
severest
affliction that ever child indured, was
more than my
spirits
could
support
, I turned
my face from her to to hide the tears that
trickled
fast
from my eyes; but could not
command
my voice to give her an
answer
, when
she
continued: Well, but where are Mr.
and Mrs. Howard, and
master
Richard?
My brother is in IndiaI have no parents.
Poor, dear girl,
said
the other young
lady, now
speaking
for the
first
time, that
is a dreadful thing. I know what it is to
have no parents. She took my hand, and
I
saw
her mild eyes
glisten
with
compassion
.
I
wished
to put an end to this painful
conversation
, and therefore
desired
to know
if they would keep any of the caps. Oh,
yes, I
shall
have
several
, but
stop
Meriel, I
must
let my mother know you are here.
Dear, how
she
will be
surprized
; and you
shall
go down to Baker,
she
will pay you,
and do have a
glass
of wine before you go,
and a bit of bride cake: you don't know I
am married.
I
wish
you much
happiness
madam,
said
I, coldly; but I cannot
stay
to take
any
refreshment
: I have been here much
longer than I ought to have
staid
. You
must
know, my dear Celia, that my pride
was hurt at the idea of
standing
first
to be
catechised
by the mother, and then be
dismissed
to the
house
-keeper for wine and
cake; and this treatment from a girl, who
once called
herself
my friend, and thought
herself
honoured by the title. However, I
could not
escape
; the mother was called,
and the bell rang for Mrs. Baker. I
answered
Mrs. Pringle's
questions
in as
short
a manner as
possible
; but
obstinately
refused
going down with the
house
-keeper.
Ah! poor girl,
said
Mrs. Pringle, in an
affected
whisper
to her daughter; let the
wine be brought up, my dear; you
see
she
cannot as yet
submit
to the alteration in her
situation
.
You are
mistaken
madam,
said
I,
I do not feel the
least
embarassment
from
the reflection that I owe my
support
to
industry
:
it is what many, more worthy than
myself
are obliged to do, it is by no means
humiliating. True dignity is
seated
in the
soul
, nor can any
situation
make me forget
the
respect
ever due to
myself
. I cannot
but reflect ladies, that I am the
same
Miss
Howard, whom
some
few years ago, you
were
so
extremely fond of, and eagerly
striving
which could
shew
her the
most
respect
.
Tho' I am now bereaved of that
fortune
,
which I percieve was the magnet
which attracted your attentions. I can make
proper
distinctions
; as a trades
person
, I
can
easily
submit
to be turned over to your
house
-keeper for payment; but
remembering
I have once been your companion, am
still
your equal, I cannot
submit
to be
placed on a level with your
servants
.
They could not
answer
. Shame and
astonishment
tied their tongues. I
curtsied
slightly
and followed Mrs. Baker out of the
room. While
she
was paying me, the
loquacious
house
-keeper informed me that her
master
had been married about three weeks;
that he never
saw
Miss
Pringle till within a
month of their union; that he danced with
her at a ball, and was
struck
with her
pleasing
person
, and
insinuating
manner; but
I can
see
, continued
she
, it will not be a
very happy union; and
Miss
Sally, poor
girl, will be more unhappy than ever. It
was a
sad
thing,
sir
John left her
dependant
on her brother. What then,
said
I, your
master
is a baronet? No,
said
she
, his father was a knight, but the
title died with him. He was a wealthy
citizen, and was knignted for carrying an
address
to the king on
some
particular
occasion
.
I had now recieved my money, and
not
wishing
to pry into the
secrets
of a
family
,
with whom I
desired
not to form any
connection, I
wished
Mrs. Baker a good
morning, and left the
house
. In the hall I
met
Miss
Sally. You will have a long
walk
Miss
Howard,
said
she
; had I any
command here, you
should
not carry that
heavy box.
It is not heavy,
Miss
,
said
I.
But it is
cumbersome
,
she
replied,
and you are not
accustomed
to
such
employment. She then opened the door
herself
, and
smiling
, with a
sweet
look of
benevolence,
wished
me a good morning. I
pitied the dear girl, for
sure
I am, if
she
is
dependant on her brother, her new
sister
will not contribute to make her life very
comfortable.
As I walked home, I could not avoid
reflecting
on this rencounter with
Miss
Pringle
;
nor did my heart entirely approve my
own conduct: there was too much pride in
the manner in which I
spoke
to her:
indeed
,
since
I have been poor, Celia, I have
discovered
that I am very proud, much more
so
than is becoming; I will endeavour to
correct this error, and in future adapt my
sentiments
to the
station
in which it has
pleased
Providence to place me.
I have met with many civilities from
some
of Mrs. Lacour's
customers
;
especially
a
Mrs. Moreton, who is a woman of very
genteel
fortune, at
least
, if I am to conjecture
from the manner in which
she
lives:
she
is
very fond of poetry, and has
advised
me to
endeavour to
raise
a
subscription
for the
publication
of
those
poems I formerly
mentioned
to you. Mrs. Lacour does not
disapprove
the plan, and I am by this indulging
woman, allowed more time to
pursue
my
favourite
study
, than I
should
have met with
in any other place. I have obtained
several
very
respectable
names to my
subscription
;
and have
some
cards of
proposals
printed
which I keep in the
shop
to
present
to the
ladies who
constantly
frequent it. I cannot
say
, Celia, but it would be much more
pleasing
to me, could I obtain a living by the
exertion
of any of my natural talents, than by
following the
straight
forward path of the
plodding woman of
business
;
besides
I was
never
designed
for a milliner, I cannot
flatter
,
I cannot tell a woman whom age, and
other natural defects, have rendered
extremely
plain, that a full
dress
cap with
artificial
flowers
small
handkerchief, and all
the gay trappings that belong to the
smiling
season
of eighteen, will become her face and
figure: and yet this is a very
necessary
ingredient
in the
composition
of a milliner.
I
wish
to my heart
some
other plan could
be
struck
out, where I
should
not be obliged
to
say
and
attest
things
so
directly contrary
to my own opinion. I am not
so
happy in
this family as I at
first
thought I
should
be,
Mr. Lacour pays me too much attention
lately; I hate the forward concieted fellow,
tho' were it only to mortify
Mademoiselle
I
could take a
pleasure
in
listening
to his
nonsense
;
but when I reflect that by
so
doing I
may wound the peace of a
deserving
woman,
who treats me with
tenderness
, and favours
me with her
esteem
, I feel
such
a mixture of
horror end
detestation
rise
in my heart, that
I frequently
answer
his
passionate
sallies
with
an acrimony, that makes him bite his lips
with vexation. I
shall
be glad when my time
is expired, tho' I have as yet thought of no
elligible plan to
pursue
in future. Adieu, my
friend, believe in every change of fortune
I am your's affectionately.
MERIEL.
LETTER XXX.
MERIAL to CELIA,
London
,
July
15
th
, 1780.
Again
, my beloved Celia, am I
cast
upon the world without a friend to
guide me;
scarcely
yet have I
seen
twenty
years, and what
vicissitudes
of fortune have
I experienced. In my
last
I mentioned my
design
of
publishing
some
poems by
subscription
;
but in that
design
I am
disappointed
,
as well as in every other from which I have
ever hoped to extract either
pleasure
or
comfort.
About a month
since
I recieved the
following
letter, from the gentleman to whom
Mr. Welldon gave me a direction; I
transcribe
it for your
perusal
, that you may
see
how unfortunate I am in having the
most
innocent actions of my life
wrested
in
such
a
manner as to be made to appear to my
disadvantage
.
Vol. II. F
TO MISS HOWARD.
Friday-
street
, May
3
d
.
MISS HOWARD,
WHEN your friend, Mr. Welldon, left
England he did not
propose
staying
above
six
weeks or two months at
most
; but
unfortunately
for him he has been detained on
the continent by a continued
series
of ill
health, and he is now at Aix-la-Chappelle
in a very dangerous
state
. When
last
I
saw
him he gave me a very particular account of
your
first
acquaintance with him, an account
which I
must
confess
raised
you both in my
opinion, as it proved the
goodness
of your
hearts: he
also
informed me in what manner
he had placed you with Mrs. Lacour, and
desired
I would frequently call and enquire
how you went on, and whether you were
satisfied
with the treatment you
received
.
Family
uneasiness
, and various
vexations
have prevented my fulfilling my
promise
,
till
last
Thursday
, when I called at Mrs.
Lacour's, and the
result
of that
visit
leads
me to trouble you with this letter; for as I
must
naturally feel
interested
in the welfare
of every one dear to Mr. Welldon, I think it
my duty to give you a little advice, and to
let you know in what light you are
considered
by the major part of the family where
you
reside
. At the time I made my
visit
you were out, waiting on
some
ladies: Mrs.
Lacour
spoke
of you in the
tenderest
manner
,
but
said
you were by no means
calculated
for the
business
Mr. Welldon had
placed you in; her
sensibility
is very great
sir
,
said
she
, and her notions
so
very refined
and delicate,
she
is totally unable to bear the
rude and often
insulting
manners of many
of our
customers
:
besides
,
sir
,
she
loves
study
too well ever to make any great
proficient
at her needle. Mrs. Lacour being
called
away, a pert, forward French woman
undertook
to
finish
your character:
she
threw
out the
most
malignant
aspersions
on your
conduct in general,
said
you had made
yourself
the laughing
stock
of the whole family,
that many of the ladies who frequented the
shop
,
distinguished
you by the appellation of
little
scribbler
: that you were
thoughtless
,
extravagant, proud, vain, and indolent: and
that you had by your artful conduct alienated
the affection of
monsieur
Lacour from his
wife, and in all
these
assertions
she
wss joined
by her companions, who
seemed
to
consider
you only as a fit object of ridicule.
Tho' I could not avoid
seeing
the motive
that
instigated
these
women was envy, yet
the reviewers call it
sad
trash
, and my lady
I
must
think you have not conducted
yourself
altogether in the prudent manner I
should
have expected from the character Mr.
Welldon gave of you.
Consider
Miss
Howard
,
industry
is the only hope you can have
of future
support
: let me conjure you
therefore
,
as a friend, to throw
aside
the pen,
and apply to your needle, and let your
inventive
fancy be exerted to decorate the
persons
of your fair country women.
Believe
me, the hill of
Parnassus
is too high
for you to climb,
unless
you had the hand
of independance to help you up; the
finest
turned poem will be entirely overlooked by
the world when
ushered
into it by an
obscure
author; while a
raphsody
of
nonsense
will be
universally
read and applauded when
the author is publicly known to be favoured
with the
smiles
of fortune. We will
suppose
,
my dear, that you had
finished
a
pleasing
elegant poem,
essay
, novel, or what not;
and that
some
bookseller
should
for a trifling
consideration
engage to introduce it to
public
notice; a new publication no
sooner
makes it appearance than the people of
fashion
enquire, who the author is. Have
you read the new poem my lady?
says
sir
Timothy Trifle. No not I, is it good for
any thing? 'Pon honour I don't know,
Pedegree told me it was wrote by a little
milliner, who lived at Lacour's,
Prithee, dear
sir
Timothy, no more, I
am quite
sick
already; what can a milliner's
girl know of litirature? Thus my dear,
you will find people of
fashion
will not give
your book a
perusal
: and tho' there are
some
few who may read it with
pleasure
,
and give it the encomiums its merit
deserves
,
they will be
ashamed
to avow an opinion
contrary to that of their
superiors
; while
the generality of the world
satisfied
with
the
sentence
already
passed
, will not be at
the trouble of reading and judging for
themselves
:
the
consequence
will be you will not
sell
enough to pay the expence of printing
and paper, and you will have the
mortification
to
see
your poems
used
as
waste
paper
,
to wrap up parcels, &c.
I flatter
myself
, your natural good
sense
will lead you to
consider
this letter in the
friendly light it was intended, that you will
do your
utmost
to cradicate from the minds
of your companions every idea they may have
formed to your
disadvantage
, that you will
drop all thought of
shining
in the literary
world, and apply
yourself
chearfully to that
employment by which you may hope to
pass
through life with comfort and
respectability
.
I am, your
sincere
wellwisher
,
H. FRIENDLY.
F 2
The reception of this letter made me very
uneasy
,
especially
the part which mentioned
the
illness
of my kind hearted benefactor:
I was grieved
also
to find what a bubble I
had been to
Mademoiselle
and all the
apprentices
,
as they had all pretended to be
greatly
pleased
with my writings, and had
often
said
it was a
thousand
pities,
so
bright
a genius
shonld
be buried in oblivion:
however
it opened my eyes to their deceit and
flattery; and I determined to be more
upon
my guard in future. I felt extremely
grateful to Mr. Friendly for the trouble he
had taken in writing to me,
answered
his
letter immediately,
promised
to profit by his
advice, and
reqnested
to be again favoured
with a few lines whenever he
should
hear
from Mr. Welldon.
From this time I applied
myself
with
great
assiduity
to my employment; tho' I
could not help noticing a
visible
alteration
in Mrs. Lacour's behaviour:
she
became
cold and
distant
, frequently
spoke
to me in
a tone of
displeasure
, and
seemed
carefully
to avoid my
conversation
, except what was
absolutely
necessary
in the
business
. The
apprentices treated me with
disrespect
, and
Mademoiselle
aimed at me the
most
pointed
sarcasms
. Things were in this
situation
,
when one day as I was
sitting
pensive
in a
little back parlour, where we
usually
breakfasted
,
I was
surprised
by the
sudden
entrance
of
Monsieur
Lacour, who began in
the
usual
strain
to
profess
his admiration,
and
audaciously
solicited
return of his illicit
passion
.
Your
insolence
sir
,
said
I, is
insufferable
,
I can no longer
submit
to it, and if
ever again you
shock
my ears with
such
infamous
solicitations
I will inform your much
injured wife of your intimacy with
Mademoiselle
.
I then would have left the room
but he threw
himself
between me and the
door, and
seizing
my hand, impudently
swore
, my threat proceeded only from
jealousy
.
But come my
sweet
creature,
said
he do not let that make you
uneasy
, I will
promise
never to
speak
to Bagatelle again.
He then fell on his knees with a look of
ludicrous
grimace, which at another time would
only have made me laugh: but at that time
I felt far different
sensations
. Unable to free
myself
from his
grasp
, and hurt at the mean
opinion he entertained of me, all my
fortitude
forsook
me, and I
burst
into tears. At
that moment the door opened, and in
rushed
Mrs. Lacour,
Mademoiselle
and Mr.
Friendly.
Oh Meriel! cried Mrs. Lacour; I
could not have believedShe would have
fallen to the ground, had I not
sprang
forward
to catch her as
she
fainted.
You
see
sir
,
said
Mademoiselle
to Mr.
Friendly, as we were
supporting
Mrs.
Lacour
to a chair. You
see
sir
, I told you
only the truth.
Monsieur
, in the general
confusion
walked
unobserved
away. My
distress
was very great to
see
Mrs. Lacour
in this
situation
. I feared it might be of
dangerous
consequence
, as
she
was far
advanced
in her pregnancy. I
supported
her
in my arms, chafed her temples with
Hungary
water, and on the
first
return of life,
begged her not to think me
so
guilty as I
appeared. She
shook
her head,
pushed
me
from her, and leaning on
Mademoiselle
's
arm, went out of the room.
I then
addressed
Mr. Friendly as a
stranger
;
for I did not at that time
personally
know him; and entreated he would
endeavour
to heal this breach between Mrs.
Lacour
and
myself
: indeed
sir
,
said
I,
she
is the only friend I have; I would
sooner
die than injure her. I then related briefly
every thing that had
past
, and fully
explained
the
cause
of the tears he
saw
me
shed
.
Appearances are undoubtedly
against
you
Miss
Howard,
said
he, but I am
willing
to believe you innocent. I am
extremely
sorry
there is any
dissention
between you
and Mrs. Lacour,
she
being as you have
just
remarked, your only friend. I
yesterday
received a letter from Mrs. Welldon,
informing me that her
husband
died about
a fortnight
since
. She mentions you as a
person
of whom Mr. Welldon
spoke
in his
last
moments, and
desires
me to give you
fifty pounds, to buy mourning; at the
same
time
she
bids me inform you it is the
last
you will receive from her.
I was
so
overcome, indeed I may
say
stupified
with grief, I was totally unable to
answer
.
He
saw
and I believe pitied my
distress
and thus continued. I have added to this
little
present
fifty pounds more; and would
advise
you to leave this family immediately,
and in
some
genteel neighbourhood open a
little
shop
, endeavour to gain employment; be
prudent and
industrious
, and I have no doubt
of your
success
; but prithee, good my girl,
burn your pens and paper, and believe me, a
woman makes as awkward a figure engaged in
literary
pursuits
, as a
counsellor
would do
seated
at a tambour frame or
busied
in
assorting
colours for embroidery. I
promised
to
remember his friendly advice, he paid me
the money and took his leave.
I was now anxious to
see
Mrs. Lacour but
all attempts to that
purpose
were
fruitless
. I
wrote a letter
protesting
my innocence and
received a verbal
answer
by one of the
aprentices
that the thing was too plain to admit of
any doubt, that
she
wished
me well but had
no
desire
ever to
see
me again. I retired to
my apartment with a heart overcharged
with
sorrow
. At any other time, the death
of my benevolent friend Mr. Welldon would
have been in
itself
a
sufficient
affliction: but
now I had the additional one of knowing I
had tho, unintionally, injured the health of
a woman, I
sincerely
esteemed
, incurred the
censures
of the world, and
cast
an indeliable
blemish
on my reputation, which it had ever
been my
study
to
preserve
unsullied
. In
these
melancholy reflections I
past
the day; in the
evening the
servant
brought me up a candle
and
some
supper
: but I was too much
agitated
to eat, and went early to bed, tho' I
was fully convinced that to
sleep
would be
impossible
.
About twelve o'clock I heard a great
bustle
below, and fearing for Mrs. Lacour I
jumped out of bed and opening my chamber
door to
listen
, plainly heard one of the young
women
say
,
she
cannot live, the doctor
says
it is
impossible
. Terrified beyond
measure
I put on a few cloaths and ran
hastily
down
stairs
, determined at all events to
see
this dear
sufferer
, and by convincing her of
my innocence
restore
her mind to peace.
The danger
she
was in had thrown the family
into
such
confusion
, that I found no
opposition
made to my entering the appartment.
The curtains were
close
drawn round the
bed, and there was little light in the room,
so
that
she
did not perceive me when I
entered
,
I found the agitation of her mind had
thrown her into a premature labour, and
that the
surgeon
imagined her life to be in
iminent danger. Every other thought was
now
absorbed
in my anxiety for her. I
beckoned
her
sister
who was
setting
by the
bedside
.
She came to me, I told her the
distress
of my mind and begged her to believe me
not guilty. Dear Meriel,
said
she
, I
never thought you
so
, nor would my poor
sister
have ever entertained an idea to your
prejudice, had it not been for the
insinuations
of Bagatelle, who has now plainly
discovered
the motive which led her
so
maliciously
to
asperse
your character: however no
one can now have a doubt of your
innocence
.
Mademoiselle
went out about eight
this evening, which greatly
surprised
us, as
my
sister
was
so
ill. As the evening
advanced
,
her
abscence
became more
astonishing
,
and about an hour
since
a
person
called
who had
seen
Bagatelle and the ungrateful
Lacour get into a
chaise
at an inn door and
drive off for Dover.
Tho' my heart bled for Mrs. Lacour, I
could not but rejoice that this proceeding of
theirs was a convicing proof of my
innocence
.
I inquired, if this unfortunate
woman
had been informed of their
persidy
,
and being
answered
in the affirmative, and
told that the intelligence had precipitated
her
illness
, I
asked
, if I might be permited
to
speak
to her. When
she
was informed
that I was in the room,
she
called me to her
with a faint voice, and taking hold of my
hand,
said
, Meriel, forgive me, I have
injured you; but I was
myself
decieved.
She could not
say
more, her pains became
excruciating, and after continuing many
hours in a
state
of
exquisite
torture,
she
resigned
her breath, having given birth to a
female infant who
survived
her mother but
a few moments.
Lacour's flight, and his wife's death was
soon
spread
abroad; and it was
discovered
that he had not only collected all the debts,
previous to his departure, but had
also
stripped
the
house
of every thing valuable,
so
that when the creditors brought in their
accounts
,
there was not
sufficient
property to
pay five
shillings
in the pound. Every
thing was immediately
seized
, and the
hapless
Mrs. Lacour would have been obliged
to the
parish
for a decent funeral, had not
her
sister
, tho' but in indifferent
circumstances
and
myself
borne the expence between
us. When I had paid every
necessary
respect
to the memory of this unfortunate
woman
,
I began to think of my own affairs.
You may remember my mentioning a Mrs.
Moreton, from whom I had recieved many
civilities. She lived at a
small
village a few
miles out of town. To her I applied for
advice
,
in my
present
embarrassing
situation
.
She received me with
politeness
, told me
she
would exert
herself
to the
utmost
to
serve
me and
said
she
thought I might make
my
business
answer
very well in
Kensington
,
where
she
had many friends to whom
she
could recommend me. To a heart formed for
all the endearing and
social
ties of life, how
every little
kindness
is received with
gratitude
,
and how does it feel the attentions
even of common civility. I feel
myself
growing
attached to this Mrs. Moreton, her
manner
is the
most
preposessing
, her form
ellegant
and and
she
posesses
the polite
accomplishments
in an imminent degree. She is
the wife of an officer now in India, by whom
Vol. II. G
she
has two lovely children, her
mansion
is
a little
terrestial
paradise
. Every thing about
it is neat, compact, and charming.
I have not as yet met with an apartment
to
suit
me, tho' I have
seen
several
, however
it is determined I
shall
not have a
shop
but
carry on my
business
as a chamber milliner.
My heart
almost
sinks
at the idea of a
young, unprotected creature like
myself
,
venturing upon
such
a plan, but what can
I do, convinced as I am of the
impossibility
of ever doing any thing in the literary way,
I
shall
never more renew my attempts.
I
must
remember the
last
words of my
dear mother, be humble, patient and
industrious
,
and rely on heaven for
support
.
Let me have your prayers, my beloved Celia.
But I need not
ask
them, I am
sure
my
sweet
benevolent friend looks round the whole
universe
with an eye of heavenly
complacency
,
and
wishes
every
bosom
as tranquil as
her own; and that your
happiness
may
never
be
diminished
, is the fervant prayer of
MERIEL.
LETTER XXXI.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Kensington
,
August
23
d
, 1780.
I am
now
settled
in a very neat
apartment
,
within about a half a mile of Mrs.
Moreton's
house
; the people with whom I
lodge appear obliging and friendly, and from
the
specimen
I have already had, I think I
shall
obtain a very genteel living, as I have
much more work than I can perform
myself
,
and am obliged to employ
several
young
women. My Sundays I always
spend
with
Mrs. Moreton, accompanying her to church
in the morning,
she
dines
so
late, it is
impossible
to go in the afternoon. She has
introduced me to the family of a Mr. Belger,
a man of great genius, and independent
fortune: Mrs. Belger is the
most
exquisitely
beautiful woman I ever beheld; but
she
has
no
accomplishments
, nor can I think
she
has
been even decently educated; indeed, I
have heard it
whispered
that
she
is not his
wife; however,
she
goes by his name, does
the honours of his table, and has by him a
sweet
little girl, the very image of her
beautiful
mother: this child has more firmly
knit the bonds that holds her faithful to
its father; but tho' every look, word and
action,
speaks
the ardency and purity of her
attachment: he treats her with a cold
respect
,
which I am
sure
must
cut her to the
soul
:
he is civil, polite, but
distant
. In this
family
I
spend
many agreeable hours; I think
Mr. Belger the
most
sensible
man I ever
conversed
with, indeed, the more I
converse
with him the more I am convinced of my
own ignorance; he kindly endeavours to
instruct
me, directs my
taste
in the choice of
authors, corrects my judgment, and takes
great
pleasure
in improving me in both
music
and drawing. To
confess
the truth, I
have but little time to
spare
for
these
persuits
;
but I
sometimes
steal
a few hours
from
rest
to perform my
necessary
employments
,
that I may the next day have a little
time to attend to Mr. Belger's
instructions
.
We cannot quite agree about religious
matters
,
but I
dispute
with him, nor have I any
doubt of making a convert of him; for at
present
, my dear Celia, this agreeable man
either is or pretends to be an infidel; I
rather
think it is the latter, for he
said
the
other evening he loved to hear my
sentiments
delivered with
such
charming
enthusiasm
,
tho' they were in direct
opposition
to
his own. I have had
some
doubt about the
propriety of continuing my intimacy in this
family, as Mrs. Belger is
supposed
to be
only
his
mistress
; but her whole conduct is
such
as may call a
blush
upon the cheek
of many an
insolent
woman, who looking
with
merciless
disdain
on her poor fallen
sisters
,
smiles
contemptously
and thanks
heaven
she
is virtuous. Mrs. Belger is a
tender
,
exemplary mother, a kind
mistress
to
her
servants
, a good
christian
, and a meek,
obedient, faithful, I had
almost
said
wife; but
the
mystic
words have not
passed
that can
render her character
respectable
in every
eye: you will therefore
say
, my dear Celia,
she
is an improper companion for a girl
whose
reputation has once been doubted, and
cannot
be regained by
associating
with a woman,
whose
character is
suspicious
: True, my dear
girl, but I feel
myself
so
attached to the family
so
grateful for the attentions
shewn
me, and
am
so
conscious
of my own
solitary
friendless
situation
, that my heart deprived of every
affection, every fond hope on which it once
rested
, naturally clings to
those
whose
kindness
sooths
its anxieties to
rest
.
G 2
September
16
th
.
I have been
so
frightened, my dear Celia,
that I believe it will be
sometime
before I
recover
myself
; and I cannot but
consider
it
a great mercy that I am alive and able to
relate
the
cause
of my terror. In the
apartment
adjoining the room where I
sleep
, the
maid of the
house
sleeps
with two of the
younger children, for they have a large
family
.
About four o'clock this morning, I
was awoke by a
sense
of
suffocation
, and
starting
up, perceived my chamber to be full
of
smoak
, I jumped out of bed and looking
round to fee that there was no appearance of
fire in the room, ventured to open one of
the windows a little way to
disperse
it. I
then opened the door, which led to the
childrens
room, here the
smoak
was more thick,
and I found the
smell
of fire grow
stronger
;
but what were my
sensations
, on going into
their apartment to
see
a
basket
of cloaths
which
stood
on a chair by the
bedside
all on
fire, and the curtains of the bed which were
fortunately of woolen
just
beginning to burn.
I had not an
instant
for
consideration
,
Providence
directed me; for I am
conscious
that
reason
was for a few moments intirely
suspended
,
I ran back to my own bed;
dragged
of a blanket and immediately threw it
over the burning
basket
, at the
same
time
pouring on it a large pan of water, which
stood
in the room, and had been placed
there for the
purpose
of
washing
the
children
.
I then awoke the
servant
, and took
the dear little innocents out of the bed;
they had been
so
nearly
suffocated
it was
with difficulty I awoke them, and when
brought into the air blood
gushed
from their
noses
: when I had a little recovered them
and laid them in my bed, I returned to the
other chamber,
sent
the maid down for
more water, and having entirely
extinguished
every appearance of fire, began to have the
use
of reflection: my own
almost
miraculous
escape
from
so
horrible a death, the
safety
of the children, nay, the
preservation
of the lives and property of the whole
family
,
impressed
my mind with
such
awful
gratitude
towards the Power, who had in
such
unexpected danger
inspired
and directed me,
that I threw
myself
on my knees and
burst
into tears of unfeigned
thankfulness
. Had
I not
discovered
it at the time I did, we
must
all have inevitably
perished
; for the
rest
of
the family lay in apartments built
distinctly
from this part of the
house
: the
apartments
I occupied were over the
shop
, and
this room really belonged to me, but as I
had no
use
for it I gave it up to the
servant
and children. The
master
,
mistress
, three
more children and two apprentices,
slept
on
the ground floor behind the
shop
,
so
that
the whole front of the
house
might have
been in flames, before they would have
discovered
it. I
asked
the girl how
she
imagined
the accident had happened;
she
said
she
often was obliged to
sit
up very late for
her
master
, that
she
had been up that night,
till near two o'clock, and being obliged to
work very hard in the day time,
she
was
very
sleepy
and weary; that
she
imagines
she
must
have left the candle burning on
the floor, and that it had caught
some
of the
linen that hung from the
basket
. You may
easily
suppose
I was not inclined to go to
bed again, I therefore
dressed
myself
, and
waited the
rising
of the family. When I
heard Mrs. Newtram up, I took the two
young children in my hand and went down.
You are up early,
Miss
Howard,
said
she
, I hope the children have not been
making a
noise
to
disturb
you. I was up
much earlier than you can imagine, I
replied
,
but believe me
these
little dears
have been very quiet and good, but I was
sadly
alarmed this morning at four o'clock.
Alarmed, my dear ma'am, at what? At
an accident which had like to prove fatal to
us all. Good God!
said
she
, what
can have been the matter? Come, come,
my good Mrs. Newtram,
said
I,
seeing
her
turn pale, there is no
occasion
for terror
now, the danger is
past
, you
see
your
children
are
safe
, but we have been all on fire
up
stairs
to night. Merciful heaven!
said
she
, that
careless
Betty. Do not
blame the girl Mrs. Newtram, fatigued as
she
is in the day time,
she
cannot be
supposed
capable of
sitting
up till two or three
o'clock in the morning,
especially
when we
recollect
she
in general
rises
at
six
, to
perform
her daily avocations; and I will
just
beg leave to mention that it is my
earnest
wish
she
may be forgiven:
she
has
suffered
enough already from her fright, do not,
therefore, reproach her, and I will be
answerable
such
an accident never happens
again in any place where
she
is. I then
took Mrs. Newtram up
stairs
, and
shewed
her the things that had been on fire. When
she
saw
the imminent danger to which her
children had been
exposed
,
she
caught them
in her arms and with all the
enthusiasm
of
maternal affection,
blest
heaven for their
preservation
. Oh!
Miss
Howard,
said
she
, how can we ever be grateful enough
for your quick recollection in
such
an
alarming
situation
; we are bound to
consider
you
as our guardian angel.
I
stopped
the good woman in the
midst
of
her acknowledgments, to renew my
entreties
for Betty's pardon, and that
she
might
be continued in her place. I can deny
you nothing,
said
she
; but I am afraid
Mr. Newtram will be inveterate
against
her.
That will be cruel indeed,
said
I, for
he was
himself
undoubtedly the prior
cause
of the accident, by keeping
such
very late
hours. She then went down
stairs
, and I
went to
breakfast
; which before I had half
finished
was interrupted by the entrance of
Mr. Newtram. He repeated every
acknowledgment
before made by his wife,
sealed
Betty's pardon, and declared he
wished
for
nothing more, than for
some
opportunity
to convince me of his gratitude, and that
he would
almost
lay down his life to
serve
me. Thus you
see
, my dear Celia, this
accident will in the end terminate for my
good, as it
seems
to have
secured
the
affection
and
friendship
of
those
, in
whose
house
I
reside
; and in
case
of future trouble
I make no doubt, but I
shall
find in
these
worthy people, a
kindness
nearly maternal.
Farewell my friend; your's ever.
MERIEL.
LETTER XXXII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
Kensington
,
December
5
th
, 1780.
MR. BELGER has frequently private
concerts at his
house
. I always am
one of the party. Sometimes I perform on
the piano forte;
sometimes
sing
, and
always
meet with
such
applause
, as
almost
makes me vain; indeed the
praises
of
Mr. Belger only, are
sufficient
for that
purpose
.
He is the only man I could ever
think perfectly agreeable,
since
the conduct
of Rainsforth gave me
so
very
despicable
an opinion of the whole
sex
. But of one
thing I am convinced; it is dangerous to
enter into arguments with
persons
who
have an improper opinion of religious
matters
.
I have had frequent
conversations
with Mr. Belger on this topic, and
instead
of
being able to convince him of his errors.
(You will tremble whem I tell you) I have
only imbibed his principles, and find doubt
arising
in my mind concerning the
most
sacred
parts of the holy writings. Oh! my
dear Celia, pray for your weak friend, that
she
may not be
lost
by
listening
to this
insinuating
man. I have indeed made
frequent
resolutions
to avoid his company, and
as frequently broke them. I take my heart
severely
to
task
. Surely Celia, after it has
suffered
so
much from the perfidy of the
sex
, it cannot be
so
weak, nay
so
wicked, as
to feel an attachment for a man who is
another's
right. Do not fear for me, my
beloved
friend; if I cannot command my feelings,
I can my actions. Should I at
some
future
period
discover
that Rainsforth is not the
capricious character, he at
present
appears,
I will never have the mortification to
reflect
,
I have rendered
myself
unworthy of
his
esteem
: if
otherwise
, it
shall
never be
in the power of any man to
boast
, that he
has triumphed over the virtue of Meriel
Howard. No Celia, I may be unfortunate,
but I never will be guilty.
Business
does not
answer
so
well as I
expected
.
Many, I believe, employed me at
first
from motives of
curiosity
, and that
being gratified, they return to
those
they
formerly dealt with; and I have now
scarcely
enough to employ
myself
, and one young
woman, whom Mrs. Moreton has
recommended
to me. However, I keep up my
spirits
as well as I can, and hope for better
times. My letters are few, you
say
lately.
Indeed I have nothing either new or
interesting
to write about. When I have, you
shall
hear from your
MERIEL.
LETTER XXXIII.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
February
9
th
, 1781.
What
a world this is, my friend,
and of what a medly of
strange
inconsistent
characters is it
composed
. Were
it not impious, I could
wish
I had never
entered
it. Some few years
since
, I believed
every heart glowed with humanity,
friendship
and
sincerity
toward each other. Yes,
Celia
,
at the time I left the convent
these
were
Vol. II. H
my ideas of the world. Nay it is but very
lately I began to perceive how erroneous my
opinion was; but believe me, the more we
know of mankind the
less
we find to admire
or
esteem
. The heart grows hardened by
repeated
disappointments
, and from having
an unbounded confidence in our
fellow-creatures
,
we begin to
suspect
every one of
hypocrisy
.
My dear friend, I am
still
the
sport
of
capricious
fortune. Deceived, betrayed by
those
I
most
loved and
trusted
, I have no
comfort left but my dependance on heaven,
(which thank God, I have regained) and the
conscious
integrity of my own heart.
Some little time after my
last
letter, Mrs.
Moreton called on me one morning, in her
way to town, and
asked
if I would take a ride
with her. She was in Mr. Belger's carriage.
I had nothing to prevent me and
immediately
complied. We proceeded to town,
and
stopped
at a
silk
mercer's. Mrs.
Moreton
ordered
some
silks
to be put up, but when
she
came to pay for them,
discovered
she
had
left her
purse
behind her. I had money
sufficient
about me, and therefore offered to pay
the amount of the bill. Do
so
, my dear,
said
she
, it will be all the
same
. I can pay
you again when we get home. It came to
upwards of ten pounds, as
she
purchased
a
piece of
silk
for a lady whom
she
expected out
of the country. When we returned the
expected
lady was arrived. She approved the
silk
, and after dinner took a walk to my
apartments
,
where
she
ordered
some
very elegant
linen to be made: the lace
she
chose
it to be
trimed with, was two guineas per yard. You
can get this done by Saturday afternoon,
said
Mrs. Moreton, for we are obliged to pay
a
visit
to very particular people, and this lady
would
wish
to have it to wear. As
soon
as they
were gone, I wrote to a laceman in town, to
send
me more of the lace; for the
handkerchief
,
apron, and ruffles were all to be full
trimed. As I had dealt with him before, he
did not
hesitate
. The
muslin
I had by me;
and on Saturday afternoon, according to
their
desire
, I took the whole
suit
home,
which, when
finished
, came to near fifty
pounds. They were much
pleased
with it,
and
desired
I would bring my bill on Monday
morning, about twelve o'clock. I had a
small
gold watch by my
side
, which was given me
by Mr. Welldon. It was of no great value,
but for the
sake
of the doner, it was highly
prized by me. Meriel, my love,
said
Mrs.
Moreton, I have
sent
my watch to be
cleaned; I
shall
be at a
loss
to know how
time goes: do lend me your's for this
evening
.
I
set
great
store
by it, madam,
said
I,
it was the gift of a
deceased
friend; but
I think you will be careful of it. As I
would of my own,
she
replied, as
she
took it.
Stay, madam,
said
I, there is a little
trinket to it which I have vowed never to part
with. (It was a
small
locket which
contained
a lock of my dear mother's hair).
She
suffered
me to take it off, and Mr.
Belger's
coach coming to the door to attend the
ladies, they
set
me down at my own lodging,
and proceeded to town.
The next day, being Sunday, I dined at
Mr. Belger's, where I was
surprised
to hear
that the ladies had
sent
home the carriage,
without returning
themselves
, and that Mrs.
Moreton's children were in town with her.
However I felt no
uneasiness
or
suspicion
,
and on Monday morning repaired to Mrs.
Moreton's with my bill: but to my utter
astonishment
found the
house
entirely
shut
up, and was informed by a neighbour, that
it was a ready
furnished
house
, which
she
had occupied near a twelve-month, and that
she
had
discharged
her
servant
on Saturday
morning; that they had every
reason
to
suppose
she
did not intend to come back again,
for
she
had not paid the
house
rent, and was
besides
in debt to every body in the
neighbourhood
,
who would
trust
her; and that
on going into the
house
, which the landlord
had done early this morning, they found
nothing in it that had ever belonged to her;
but
missed
a
considerable
quantity of linen,
which had been lent her when
she
took the
house
.
I was now fatally convinced that my
confidence
in Mrs. Moreton had been ill
placed
;
the linen I had made, the money I had
lent, had, altogether, greatly contributed to
reduce my finances, and I began to
see
the
difficulties, in which this ungenerous
conduct
would involve me. At
first
, it
struck
me, that Mr. Belger had been
accessary
to
her departure; but in this I was deceived,
for on calling there, I found they were as
greatly
surprized
as I had been, and that
her
specious
appearance had
so
far
imposed
on him, that he had lent her twenty guineas
only a few days before. Overwhelm'd with
this new affliction, I returned to my
lodging
;
but judge if you
possibly
can, of my
increased
anguish
, when, on entering my
bed-chamber, I
saw
my bureau had been
forced open, all my
cash
gone, and with it
a quantity of edging to a large amount.
Almost
ready to
sink
with the terror that
seized
my mind, I rang the bell violently,
and nobody immediately
answering
, I ran
down to Mrs. Newtram's apartments and
H 2
enquired after Kitty.
Bless
me,
Miss
Howard
,
said
Mrs. Newtram, did you not
discharge
her before you went out this
morning. No, indeed I had not the
most
distant
thought of
such
a thing.
Well, that's
strange
now; for you had
not been out above five minutes, before
she
came down crying, and begged one of the
apprentices to go for a coach,
said
you had
discharged
her at a moment's warning, but
she
would go directly home to her mother.
When the coach came, we helped her in
with her boxes, and
she
drove away,
ordering
the man to
stop
at the White
Horse
Cellar, Piccadilly.
I'm undone,
said
I, what will
become
of me; and
sunk
almost
fainting,
into a chair. Mrs. Newtram got me
some
hartshorn
and water, after which I began
to
shed
tears, which in
some
measure
relieved
me. Dear
Miss
, cried Mrs.
Newtram
,
what can have happened: have
you
lost
any of your friends? Oh!
said
I, I have no friends; I am the
most
unfortunate creature breathing, nor do I
know how to extricate
myself
from the
difficulties that
surround
me.
I then gave her an account of Mrs.
Moreton's
departure, of the money, &c. I had
trusted
her with, and concluded with the
discovery
I had
just
made of Kitty's
dishonesty
.
Why to be
sure
Miss
Howard,
said
she
, it is a
sad
loss
; but you
should
have
been upon your guard
against
Mrs.
Moreton
;
you certainly knew
she
was a woman
of dubious character; and to tell you the
truth, Mr. Newtram and I have often
said
it was a great pity,
so
sweet
a young lady
should
be
so
intimate, with a woman of that
kind: then there is Mrs. Belger, why all
the world knows
she
is no better than
she
should
be; and you can't think what ill
natured things have been
said
in the
neighbourhood
,
about your being
so
much with
them.
As to Mrs. Moreton,
said
I,
believe
me, I had not the
least
idea, but that
she
was a woman of
respectable
character;
and tho' I have heard
some
things, not quite
so
much to Mrs. Belger's advantage, I never
saw
a woman in my life
whose
whole
conduct
demanded more
respect
and
esteem
.
Upon my word
Miss
,
said
she
, I am
surprized
to hear you talk
so
, when you
know (drawing up her head) Mr. Belger
is not her
husband
; but that I have a very
good opinion of you, I
should
think you was
as bad as
she
.
I think, Mrs. Newtram,
said
I, as
you
seem
to know Mrs. Moreton's character
so
well it would have been but friendly to
have given me a little warning.
Why, la!
Miss
, you know it was no
business
of mine, and you told me
yourself
you knew her before you came to
settle
here: but, how do you mean to do? I
suppose
you have
some
friends to whom you
can apply; if you have any letter, or any
thing to
send
to town one of our young
men
shall
take it.
I tell you again Mrs. Newtram, I have
not a friend in the world; I am a poor
solitary
being, unconnected with the world, or
any one in it; and were I this moment to
leave it, not one tear of affection or regret
would be
shed
upon my grave.
Dear, now that's very odd,
most
people
have
some
friend or other, but I
suppose
you have offended all your's. They are
dead,
said
I, and
unless
you favour me
with your advice and
assistance
, I know not
to whom
else
to apply. To be
soure
, I'll
give you the
best
advice in my power, but
had you not better apply to Mr. Belger?
Oh no, I would
wish
to hide my
distress
from him in particular. You are
in debt? I
suppose
,
asked
Mrs. Newtram,
in a quick accent.
Yes, I owe above forty guineas.
Well, and there is a quarter's rent of the
lodging due, that's eight more, then there's
the
laundress
and the baker. True,
said
I, in an humble tone, but I
suppose
my furniture will
sell
for as much as will
pay them. And is that all your
dependance
?
then I
shall
take care that we
loose
nothing: here, Newtram, continued
she
,
opening a door that looked into the
shop
,
here,
step
here: when he came in,
she
told him my
situation
and concluded, then
you know, as that is the
case
, we had better
take care of
ourselves
, and be the
first
to
take the furniture.
That's true dame,
said
he,
so
d'ye
see
,
Miss
, we'll
send
for a man to '
praise
the
goods to-morrow.
Astonishment
almost
suspended
my
faculties
:
just
heaven!
said
I, is this
friendship
?
Friendship
,
said
she
, tartly, I have
a large family
Miss
, and all my
friendship
must
be exerted for my children: if I was
inclined to give you the eight guineas you
owe me I cannot do it in
justice
to
these
little innocents.
Celia,
she
pointed to the two children I
had
saved
from the fire: I fixed my eyes
on the unoffending infants, a
fresh
flood of
tears
burst
from them, I folded my hands
upon my
bosom
and remained
silent
.
It was now one o'clock and the
servant
brought in their dinner; they
sat
down to
table, but did not
ask
me to partake, I
should
not have noticed the impropriety of my
remaining
in their apartment, had I not been
roused
from my
stupefaction
by the
youngest
girl, who getting from her
seat
brought
her plate of victuals and laid it in my lap,
and taking up a bit put it towards my mouth
crying, there
Missy
eat
some
dinnee. I
kissed
the dear child, and apologizing for
my
intrusion
went up to my apartment;
where I vented my full heart, in an
unrestrained
slood
of tears.
Toward evening Betty came into my
room;
she
said
her
mistress
was gone out,
and
she
had
stolen
up unknown to her
master
to
see
if
she
could do any thing for me.
You have had no dinner,
said
the kind
girl, pray let me get you
some
tea.
She then made up the fire, and
presently
provided this
repast
, which however
disinclined
,
I forced
myself
to take, to
ease
poor Betty's anxiety. When
she
had
removed
the tea things and lighted a candle,
she
went down
stairs
again, and I
sat
pensive
and
solitary
, retracing the
past
events of my
life. Alas!
said
I, how very hard is my fate.
Possessed
as I am of a heart moulded to
compassion
,
glowing with
universal
affection
towards
my fellow creatures, I am
constantly
thrown among people,
whose
every
feeling
is
absorbed
in
self
. Yet
sure
humanity
is the child of nature; it is a heavenly
spark
of intellectual fire, implanted in our
souls
by the hand divine. Every heart is
endowed with it more or
less
; but an
intercourse
with the world contributes to blunt
those
keen
sensations
, till by degrees they are
entirely deadened, and we can look on a
scene
of
misery
without the
least
emotion, if
it interferes not with our own
interest
or
happiness
.
Yet I cannot think that I
shall
ever
arrive at that happy
state
of torpidity, for
sure
,
while I can feel my own
sorrows
, I
shall
never
be
insensible
to the woes of others; for never
yet did I
see
a
person
in affliction, but I made
their
case
my own, and my heart would
instantly
overflow with pity. But alas! no
heart melts with pity for me. Even Mrs.
Newtram
seems
to have forgot that
she
has
daughters, or
she
would
surely
compassionate
my
sufferings
, by reflecting that
those
darlings
of her heart may perhaps one day be in
the
same
situation
. I was
still
pursuing
this
melancholy train of thought, when I was
startled
by a gentle tap at the door. I
arose
and opened it, but was
surprised
to
see
Mr.
Belger
enter the room. Dear
Miss
Howard,
said
he, forgive this liberty. I have been
informed of your
distress
by your officious
landlady, whom I have left chattering to
to Mrs. Belger, while I
slipped
away to offer
any
assistance
in my power to my charming
little friend. I bowed my head, but could
not
answer
. I motioned towards a chair. He
seated
himself
and continued: My dear
Meriel, I have long feared what is now
realized
;
I knew from the
first
moment I
saw
you, that you were never
designed
for the
station
, in which you have lately moved. The
elegance of your manner, the delicacy of
your
sentiments
convince me you are far
superior
to
those
women with whom it has been
your misfortune to be obliged to
associate
.
Indeed, Mr. Belger,
said
I, I am
conscious
of that
superioty
in nothing but
misery
.
I look round me with a
desponding
eye,
and think the world does not contain
so
friendless
,
so
wretched a creature as
myself
.
From my
soul
do I pity you,
said
he,
taking my hand, and
wish
it was in my
power effectually to
serve
you without
offering
any thing that might alarm your
sensibility
;
but that is
impossible
. I know of but
one method, by which you can be extricated
from your
present
difficulties. Alas,
sir
,
I replied, I have not the
least
hope of
being
extreated. All my furniture will be
seized
to-morrow, and I
shall
turned from
this habitation without knowing how to
provide
another.
Not
so
, beloved girl,
said
he. You
cannot think I will
suffer
it. Long have
I adored your merits. You
must
have
seen
my ardent affection, which has
so
often
burst
thro' the thin veil, prudence
obliged me to throw over it; and if vanity
has not
misled
me, I flatter
myself
I am not
altogether indifferent to you; if
so
, my
dear creature, what remains, but that we
this night bid adieu to all
these
vexations?
Let us defy the malignant
censures
of the
world, and happy in each other's affections,
rise
superior
to the narrow bounds
imposed
by
priest
-craft and
superstition
; dare to
think and act for
ourselves
, and
seek
that
Vol. II. I
felicity on the continent, which a
concurrence
of untoward
circumstances
prevents
our enjoying in England.
Amazement had taken entire
possession
of me during this
speech
; I was
almost
dedeprived
of the power of utterance. At
length I exclaimed good God! how have
I
deserved
this
insult
? Ungenerous man,
have you forgot Mrs. Belger.
Dear Meriel,
said
he, do not
raise
imaginary
obstacles
. You as well as all the
rest
of the world know I am not married to
that woman.
But you are bound to her,
sir
, by every
tie of honour and gratitude.
Miss
Howard,
said
he, gravely, can
you lay your hand upon your heart, and
say
you do not regard me with a
sentiment
more
lively than
friendship
.
If I know that heart, Mr. Belger, it
will never love whom it cannot
esteem
.
And whatever may be its feeling I have
learnt to conquer. I could not
finish
what
I intended to
say
, my tears flowed
so
fast
they
almost
choaked me.
Dearest
,
gentlest
girl,
said
he, I
see
the
tenderness
you vainly
strive
to hide,
then come let us fly to France and
insure
at
once both your own
happiness
and mine.
What will become of your Emma,
said
I, Can you
resolve
to
forsake
your
child?
Thank you, my
sweet
girl, for the
remembrance
,
she
shall
be the companion of
our flight.
And
so
drive her poor mother to
distraction
.
No, Mr. Belger, never
shall
it be
said
of Meriel Howard, that
she
had by her
perfidy placed a dagger in the heart of an
innocent woman; nor
shall
you forget this
confiding, affectionate woman. Has
she
not
sacrificed
every
consideration
to you, friends,
reputation, all that can render life
desireable
.
If
she
is not your wife,
she
ought
to have been
so
long
since
. And tho' you
were dearer to me than the vital tide that
nourishes
my heart, that heart
should
break
rather than injure her. In the
midst
of
poverty
and
distress
, if I can
preserve
my
integrity
unshaken
, I
shall
still
have one
comfort
,
of which no earthly power can deprive
me. Leave me Mr. Belger, I
wish
to be
alone.
Unkind girl to treat me thus, when it
was my intention to extricate you from
these
impending difficulties and placed you in
affluence
.
You would have degraded me
to infamy, I thank your
generosity
.
By heavens!
Miss
Howard I will marry
you. No, Mr. Belger, that would be
only
using
the
sacred
ceremony as a cloak
to
persidy
and deceit. Leave me,
sir
, my
resolution
is
sixed
, and not the
cruelest
tortures poverty and its attendant evils can
inflict
shall
tempt me to alter it. I then
broke from him, and going into an inner
apartment
fastened
the door, and waited till
I was certain he had left the
house
.
Tho' I now found
myself
plunged in the
most
miserable
situation
, I felt a
secret
satisfaction
in reflecting I had acted with
propriety
in regard to Mr. Belger, as
reason
plainly
pointed out how little hope there could be
of felicity with a man, who could, guided
merely by the caprice of
passion
,
forsake
a
woman
so
faithful, and
so
tender as Mrs.
Belger. Religion
also
told me, how little
I
should
deserve
,
should
I be
so
selfish
as to
fix the
basis
of my own
prosperity
, on the
misery
of a fellow creature, Almighty
Father,
said
I,
assist
me with thy grace
that I may be enabled to
persorm
my duty
in every
state
of life, and allot me what
trials
thy infinite
wisdom
shall
think proper.
I breathed this
short
prayer as I retired to
bed, a
sweet
serenity
came over my mind,
and I enjoyed a profound
sleep
till near
eight the next morning. I will now
conclude
this long letter; be
assured
you
shall
not long wait for the
sequel
of my
melancholy
tale. Your's ever
MERIEL.
I 2
LETTER XXXIV.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
March
2
d
, 1781.
I judge
of my dear Celia's impatience,
by what I
should
feel where
she
in the
situation
in which I was, when I concluded
my
last
: I will not trifle with you, but
proceed
in my narrative. The next morning I
arose
and went down
stairs
to Mr. Newtram,
told him I was ready to admit the
persons
he
had mentioned into the apartment to
value
the furniture, and hoped there would be
more than
sufficient
to pay all I owed: I
was continuing to
speak
to him, when
turning
my head I
saw
the laceman enter the
shop
. He pretended not to know my
situation
,
tho' I am certain he had been
sent
for
by Newtram, and told me a long
story
, to
which I paid but little attention, about
having
a large
sum
to make up, &c. I
desired
him to wait a little while, and I made no
doubt but I
should
have
sufficient
to
discharge
his bill. Alas! my Celia, I did not at that
time think of the
vast
difference between
selling
and buying. I knew the little furniture
I
possessed
, together with what Mr. Welldon
had given me, had
cost
more than
sixty
pounds and were at
present
nearly as good as
new. But when the man had looked them
over, and taken an inventory, he offered me
only thirty five guineas for the whole, in
which was included my piano forte. I urged
how much more they had
cost
me, and how
little they had been
used
. He
answered
that
was nothing to him; he could afford to give
no more; there were
some
things would be
of no
use
to him; they would lay a dead
stock
upon his hands, and if I did not
choose
to
take that, it was all very well, he had rather
leave them than have them.
What could I do? I found I
must
either
sell
them or go to
prison
, and tho' I knew not
by what means to
support
life, liberty had
still
some
charms for me. I took the money,
and turning toward my creditors, for by this
time they were all
assembled
, laid the money
on the table, and
desired
Mr. Newtram to
pay them all as far as it would go; but they
were not to be
satisfied
with this. You
have good cloaths,
Miss
Howard,
said
Newtram
,
you cannot expect poor people will
set
down quietly with their
loss
, and
suffer
you to go off with a trunk full of finery.
Alas!
sir
,
said
I, the cloaths you
mention
are
so
few and
composed
of
such
indifferent
materials, I did not think they would
be of any value but to the owner. There are
some
few pices of edging,
sir
, continued I,
turning to the laceman, which I
must
beg
of you to take again. My trunks were now
brought down
stairs
. Mrs. Newtram
chose
out the
best
of my gowns, linen, &c. which
were
set
down at
less
than half their value:
the edgings were produced, when to my
utter
astonishment
, the laceman declared he
would not take them without an allowance
of one third of what I had paid him for them
only a few months before.
At length all demands were
discharged
,
my furniture taken away, and
myself
left
solitary
in the empty rooms: I went down
stairs
and delivered up the keys. I had done
nothing
but weep all day, and had taken no
kind of
nourishment
since
my
breakfast
, and
it was now four o'clock in the afternoon.
Mrs. Newtram did not
ask
me to
sit
down;
but when I left the parlour I felt
myself
so
sick
and faint that I was obliged to
sit
down
on the foot of the
stairs
, where my feelings
became
so
poignant that I thought I
should
have been
suffocated
. Poor Betty came to
me, and endeavoured to comfort me, but
her own
sobs
were
so
audible as to prevent
my
understanding
what
she
said
: In a few
moments Mrs. Newtram came out of the
parlour. Dear me,
Miss
Howard,
said
she
, you will make
yourself
quite ill with
fretting, and then, what is to become of
you; come, come, cheer up, all will be well
again, by and by; one of our young men
will call you a coach, you don't
consider
how
soon
it is dark this time of the year.
I don't want a coach,
said
I, there is
nothing very heavy to carry; I will tye up
a few things in a handkerchief and leave the
rest
till I have
some
settled
place of abode,
when I will
send
for them. But it's a wet
evening, child,
said
she
, and a long
walk to town. No matter, I will not
have a coach. Perhaps,
Miss
Howard,
you will be affronted, but if you cannot pay
for one, accept
these
five
shillings
.
Celia, this vile
ostentation
, this
shew
of
generosity
, after
she
had
stripped
me of
almost
every thing, awakened my
resentment
.
No, Mrs. Newtram,
said
I, if I am
obliged to borrow money, I have a few more
cloaths left, on which I imagine I can
raise
it; but at
present
I have a few
shillings
,
which is
sufficient
for this evening,
to-morrow
I will
send
for my cloaths. She flung
into the parlour, muttering
something
about
ingratitude, pride and poverty. It was a cold
rainy evening, the latter end of October,
when with a
small
bundle in my hand, and
a load of grief at my heart, I
set
forward on
foot from
Kensington
; I had not proceeded
far before I heard a quick
step
behind me,
and
presently
was
accosted
by Mr. Belger.
Where are you going my dear
creature
,
this cold, wet night? I am going
to town,
sir
, and am in
haste
. Where
shall
you lodge in town? Indeed, I do
not know. My dear
Miss
Howard, you
are I fear more
distressed
than you are
willing
to
confess
, believe me I am your friend,
conside
in me, I will not
suffer
you to want
any
assistance
in my power to give; but we
cannot conveniently
consult
what is
best
to
be done, thus in the open
street
;
step
into
this
house
, (we were
just
opposite
an
house
of entertainment,) I have ordered my
carriage
here to take me up, and when we have
had a cup of tea we will proceed to town
together.
No,
sir
,
said
I, it is to no
purpose
to
solicit
me, I am determined to go on to
town immediately. Than let me call a
coach, my dear girl, you
must
not be thus
exposed
to the inclemency of the weather.
Mr. Belger, if you
wish
me to believe
you my friend, leave me, nor thus
increase
my
almost
insupportable
load of
anguish
, by
making offers which I neither can nor will
accept. Then let me have the
pleasure
of
supplying
you with
cash
till it is in your
power to repay me. This too I
obstinately
refused
, and the rain
just
then
increasing
,
he
ceased
his
solicitations
after
saying
I
should
always find a friend in him, he left
me to
pursue
my uncomfortable walk. It
was near
seven
o'clock, when I arrived in
town, with only a few
shillings
in my pocket
no friend to apply to and entirely at a
loss
how to
dispose
of
myself
that night, as the
people in London are fearful of taking
strangers
into their
houses
, without a proper
recommendation
;
not having
sufficient
resolution
to apply to any
house
for a lodging I
kept walking on till I came to the
strand
,
where,
just
as I was
passing
a large
haberdasher's
shop
, a carriage overturned, the
horses
took fright, and I ran with many others into
the
shop
, for
safety
; I had not been there
above five minutes, before I heard a female
voice exclaim, good God! can it be? yes, I
am certain it is
Miss
Howard; the lady had
now come
close
up to me, and on
raising
my
eyes, I beheld Amelia Sidney a young lady
whom I had once or twice
seen
at my aunts.
Shall I
confess
, that
shame
at being
seen
in
so
draggled a condition was the
first
sensation
I felt, however, Amelia
soon
made
me forget that, when kindly taking my
hand in the
soft
voice of affection,
she
said
,
my dear
Miss
Howard, where have you
hid
yourself
all this time; then
observing
my wet cloak and bonnet,
she
continued:
You have been walking in the rain my
love, I have a coach waiting, give me leave
to
set
you down wherever you
wish
to go.
The
soothing
voice of
tenderness
as
soon
wrings tears from the afflicted heart, as
does the
churlish
voice of chiding, but then
the one drops gently, while the
softest
sensations
pervade the
soul
, the other is the
source
of
such
real
anguish
, that memory
will retain the pain they
occasion
for years
afterwards.
I could not
answer
the kind
miss
Sidney,
but followed her in
silence
to the coach,
when we were
seated
she
again renewed her
question
, where will you be
set
down?
The
anguish
of my heart now
burst
out,
and I cried, I have no home: all places
are alike to me, then you
shall
go home
with me,
said
Amelia. Oh
Miss
Sidney
,
said
I, do not think by thus
accpting
your kind offer of
stepping
into the
coach I mean to throw
myself
on your
benevolence
,
my only motive was to have an
opportunity of enquiring whether you could
recommend me to any place, where I might
lodge for a little time, till I could
consider
how to
dispose
of
myself
in future. Favour
me with your advice, dear lady, for indeed
I have no friends in the world, who
interests
themselves
the
least
in my welfare. She
pressed
my hand and after
softly
saying
, be
comfored, my dear, remained
silent
, till
the coach
stopped
,
she
then
assisted
me to
alight, and leading me up
stairs
left me a
few moments in the drawing room; but
soon
returned with her mother. Mrs. Sidney
received me with the chearful
smile
of an
old friend, and Amelia brought a change of
cloaths which
she
insisted
on my putting on.
Supper
soon
came in. The manner which
Mrs. Sidney and her daughter
observed
towards me, was delicate and attentive in the
extreme. Not a word
scaped
them that
had the
least
appearance of
curiosity
; they
seemed
to treat me as tho' I had been paying
an expected
visit
, and to
consider
my
company
as an obligation; when the cloath was
removed, I told my amiable
hostess
, I thought
it but right
she
should
know by what means
I became reduced to
so
distrest
a
condition
,
but Amelia
stopped
me. Dear
Miss
Howard,
said
she
, if it is in our power
to
serve
you, do not
hesitate
to point out
Vol. II. K
the way, and you will not find us backward
in performing it; but I
insist
that you do
not enter into explanations which may be
painful to you. You have no doubt been
unfortunate, as
such
and knowing the
excellence
of your heart, you have a claim
upon my
friendship
, I am ready to prove
myself
your
sincere
well
wisher
, but I have
no right to enter into a minute
investigation
of your
past
conduct. But, my dear
lady,
said
I, it is
absolutely
necessary
,
you
should
be acquainted with many
past
incidents
of my life, that you may better
concieve
my
present
situation
and be enabled to
favour me with your advice, for my future
conduct. Well, my dear,
said
Mrs.
Sidney
,
whatever you think proper, I
thank heaven madam,
said
I, tho' I
shall
shall
acquaint you with many errors,
some
of
which I tremble but to think on, (for at that
moment, Celia, I remembered my impious
despondency
, and the divine
interposition
of
providence which delivered me at the very
moment, when to avoid temporal
misery
I
was
rushing
into guilt.) Yet I have done
nothing to make me
ashamed
, and tho' my
reputation has been
sullied
. We have all
our errors,
Miss
Howard,
said
Amelia,
and we all hope to have
those
errors
forgiven, then
should
we not be always
ready
to forgive the errors of our fellow
creatures
.
Come my dear girl let me
persuade
you to drop the
subject
, whatever have been
your errors I am
sure
you now renounce
them, and whatever are your misfortunes we
will
strive
to aleviate, if we cannot entirely
remove them. You are very good,
Miss
Sidney, but give me leave to proceed, I will
not detain you long. I then in as few
words as
possible
comprised
the whole of my
sufferings
, not even endeavouring to veil my
errors, from the time of my father's
imprisonment
,
till the
present
day;
she
listened
with attention, and taking my hand
said
,
Conviction
sits
on your countenance, I
will not doubt your relation, my dear Meriel,
because
it has been delivered with
such
ingenious
frankness
that to hear is to believe;
but you have been
strangely
misrepresented
,
by
those
whose
duty it was to defend rather
than
asperse
your character. She then
informed
me that the
Mossops
had propogated
the
most
malignant
censures
against
me,
and from at
first
pointing me out as an
object
of ridicule to entertain their friends, at
length
represented
me as fit only for their
contempt. In
short
, folly, ignorance,
hypocrisy
,
and profligacy, had been
set
forward,
as the
most
striking
traits in my character,
and at the very moment when Amelia met
me,
she
supposed
me
sunk
into infamy and
shame
. But,
said
she
, I
saw
you was
unhappy, and I know it is our duty not to
remember the faults, when an opportunity
offers, wherein we may be of
service
to a
person
in
distress
, I am now more than ever
convinced of the propriety of
such
a mode
of conduct, for had I not acted thus, I
should
never have known how much
Miss
Howard had been injured, and how little
her unworthy friends
deserved
such
a
relative
,
but I beg, continued
she
, you will
consider
yourself
at home. Believe me, you
are as welcome as a
sister
, and whenever you
hear of a
situation
which you think will
suit
you, my mother and I will give you every
necessary
recommendation, but do not be in
a hurry to leave us, we
shall
not
soon
be tired
of your company.
She then
shewed
me to a neat bed-chamber
adjoining her own, and
wishing
me a good
nights
reposse
, left me. And who is this
benevolent
girl? methinks I hear you
say
. She is,
my dear Celia, the daughter of a man, who
by
industry
in a
respectable
line of
business
,
brought up a numerous family in a reputable
manner. He lived to
see
his
sons
well
settled
in the world, and had
saved
enough to leave
at his death, Mrs. Sidney and this, his only
daughter a comfortable independence.
Amelia
had a genteel, but yet
useful
education,
she
was equally qualified to
shine
in public or
private life,
she
preferred the latter. Her
mother's
happiness
constituted
her own,
she
read to her, worked with her, confidered
her peace as the main
spring
for all her
actions
,
and loved her with a tender
respect
bordering on devotion. Yet with a
pleasing
graceful
peron
,
a lively
disposition
, and a
large
share
of good
sense
, has this amiable
girl reached her twety-fifth year, without one
offer of marriage,
she
has had many lovers,
but
she
declares they all
deserted
their
colours, when they
understood
,
she
would
have no fortune till the death of her mother.
So you
see
, my dear,
said
she
, one day
smiling
I am
destined
to wear the willow
as long as I live. More
shame
for the male
world if
she
is, Celia, for I think I could
venture to pronounce him a happy man, who
should
be
so
fortunate as to obtain
such
a wife.
I have been in this kind family, now near
a month, but have not as yet heard of any
thing, that I think will
suit
, tho' I am
determined
to take
almost
any
situation
rather
than remain a burthen upon the benevolence
of Amelia and her mother; who, tho' they
have
sufficient
for all the comforts and
some
of the elegancies of life, I am
sure
, cannot
assord
to have me
constantly
with them. I
sent
for the
rest
of my cloaths the day after
I left
Kensington
, but received no
message
K 2
from thence, nor have I heard a
syllable
of
Mr. Belger, I hope you will grant me the
credit of not
wishing
it. I even gave the
person
who went for my things a
strict
charge,
not to mention in what part of the town I
resided
.
March
3
d
.
A lady called this evening at Mrs.
Sidney's
,
who
said
she
had heard of a place
which
she
thought would
suit
me: it is to be
companion to an elderly lady in the country,
to read to her, walk with her help entertain
her company and attend a little to the
domestic
concerns of the family. The
salary
,
I find, is but
small
, that
shall
be no objection,
I never was extravagant in
dress
, and I think
I
shall
hardly begin now. I am to go
to-morrow
morning at ten o'clock to
speak
to a
lady, who is a
distant
relation of Mrs.
Rooksby
,
and who has been
desired
by her to look
out for the kind of
person
she
wants. I
wish
I may be
so
lucky as to
succeed
in this
application
,
as I
trust
I could render
myself
agreeable to the old lady, and I would
likewise
exert
myself
to be
useful
. The mail goes
to-morrow, before I
shall
have time to write
again, but my Celia, may depend on my
seizing
the
first
opportunity, to let her know
my
success
. Adieu, my beloved friend, tho'
I can never love you
less
, you
must
be
henceforth
content, to
share
with the generous
truely benevolent Amelia the affections of
your
MERIEL.
LETTER XXXV.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
March
12
th
, 1781.
Celia
, my beloved Celia, when is my
heart to be at
rest
, when
shall
I
say
,
peace dwells in my
bosom
, its anxieties are
hushed
, doubt, fear, and incertitude, are no
more. Alas! I fear Meriel will never feel
that heavenly
satisfaction
, 'till
shuddering
on
the verge of eternity,
she
fixes her hope on
the verge of eternity,
she
sixes
her hope on
things immortal, immutable and
unchangeable
.
But forgive me my friend, when I took
up my pen, I meant not to complain, indeed
I did not, I am fully
sensible
if my
blessings
were
measured
only according to my
demerits
,
I
should
be poor indeed, but our
heavenly father, portions out our comforts
according to the
measure
of his love. Alas!
if our
deserts
were only
considered
, who
would dare abide the
decision
;
friendship
is
his
choicest
best
gift, and have I not found
that pure and un-alloyed in the
breasts
of
Celia and Amleia. As to love;
It is an empty
sound
,
The haughty fair one's
jest
On earth
unseen
or only found
To warm the turtles
nest
.
Oh yes there is love on earth;
sincere
,
tender, affectionate, faithful, ardent hearts,
but they were not formed for me, Celia; and
I
must
learn
submission
without repining, you
wonder what all this means, I cannot tell you
just
now; when I am more
composed
I will
resume
my pen. How
strange
does it appear
that I
should
be an object of malice or envy
to others, who never harboured a
wish
to the
prejudice, or envied the good fortune of any
one.
The morning after I
sent
off my
last
, my
dear Celia, I
dressed
myself
neat but very
plain, and at ten o'clock found
myself
at the
door of Mr. Kingly, in Golden
square
, the
servant
, who opened it, told me his lady was
not come down: he begged I would wait
in a parlour, where there was a fire, and
brought me a
newspaper
to
amuse
me. In
about twenty minutes, he returned and
defired
me to walk up
stairs
. I followed him
into a back drawing room, where an elegant
woman
sat
preparing to make tea, and a
nurse
was in the room with a very young
child. The lady
arose
and received me with
every mark of
politeness
; but I was
scarcely
seated
before a voice
struck
my ears, which
vibrated to my throbbing heart, I felt my face
glow, but had not a moment for thought,
before the door opened, and Rainsforth
entered
the room holding a boy about twelve
months old in his arms.
Surprise
threw me
entirely off my guard, I gave a
sudden
shriek
and fainted.
What
passed
during my
indisposition
I
cannot tell, but when I recovered, I found
the lady
sitting
beside
me on the
sopha
,
applying volatiles to my
nose
and temples,
while a maid
servant
stood
by with water,
but neither Rainsforth or the children were
in the room. Are you
subject
to
these
ill turns, my dear
miss
?
said
the lady. No
madam,
said
I, but
sudden
surprise
will
sometimes
serve
me thus. Do you know
Mr. Kingly? Was it his
presence
that
caused
such
violent emotions? Only that
you call him Kingly, madam, I
should
say
the
gentleman who came in
just
now was a Mr.
Rainsforth, of Plymouth. Is your name
Howard?
said
the lady
visibly
agitated.
I
answered
in the affirmative. Then,
said
she
, I can account for the exclamation
with which he left the room. You are right
in your conjectures
Miss
Howard,
Rainsforth
and Kingly are one and the
same
person
.
He took my name on our union, of
which I
suppose
you were unacquainted. I
was indeed, a
stranger
to it, madam, or I
should
not have
presumed
to have intruded
here; pardon the involuntary
confusion
I
have
occasioned
, and permit me to retire.
You are not as yet
sufficiently
recovered,
said
she
, to venture out. Pray,
stop
, and
compose
yourself
, and if it will not
occasion
a return of your
disorder
, we will
send
for
Mr. Kingly to take his
breakfast
. I was
beginning to apologize for the
disagreeable
interruption I had given, but
she
stopped
me.
I
shall
not
listen
to a
syllable
of
excuse
. I
am
sure
it was unintentional, but I will not
forgive it on any other terms than its never
being mentioned in future.
Kingly, as I
must
henceforth call him,
was now
summoned
to
breakfast
, I
endeavoured
to command my countenance; but
I fear to little effect; I attempted to
rise
,
when he entered the room, but my limbs
refused
their office. He bowed and took his
seat
in
silence
, a cup of tea was handed
him: his hand trembled
so
he could not
raise
it to his mouth. I did not dare lift
my eyes,
least
I
should
encounter his, I felt
my face alternately red and pale; and it
was with difficulty I could
restrain
my tears.
We were all
silent
for near five minutes.
Mrs. Kingly
seemed
the
least
embarrassed
of
the three, and at length ventured to
say
,
my dear Kingly you forget your
politeness
to day, pray help
Miss
Howard to
some
muffin. I believe,
said
he, it is by
some
other name we
must
address
this lady
now.
Surprise
at what he uttered tempted
me to
raise
my eyes with a kind of
inquisitive
look. My name is
still
Howard,
said
I, nor have the
least
intention of altering
it. Were you not on the point of being
married about two years
since
? I was
more
astonished
than ever at this
question
.
I knew not what to
answer
: to have
mentioned
any thing of my intended union with
Kingly before his wife, would perhaps have
only
served
to make her unhappy. At length
I
answered
, I was, it is true, near being
married
about that time, but I had every
reason
to
suppose
you, as well as the
rest
of my
acquaintance
,
knew the
cause
of the match
being broke off. I have never had a thought
since
of altering my condition. It is very
strange
,
said
he, and the
conversation
dropped
.
I then began to recollect the
reason
which had brought me to the
house
of a
man whom I
wished
, of all others,
most
to
avoid, and turning to Mrs. Kingly made the
necessary
enquiries concerning the place I
wanted to engage for. Having received
answers
greatly to my
satisfaction
, I
arose
to
take my leave, referring her to Mrs. Sidney
for my character. I dare
say
there will be
no
necessity
to make
those
enquiries,
said
she
, but if you will mention any day when
you will favour me with your company to
dinner, I will introduce you to my aunt, who
is fortunately now in town.
I told her if
she
would favour me
so
far, as
to give me a line to Mrs.
Rooksby
, I would
wait on that lady at any time
she
would
please
to appoint, but
must
beg leave to decline the
proposed
honour of dining with her, as I
feared it would not be
possible
to
disengage
myself
from the kind friends with whom I at
present
resided
, till an
absolute
settlement
obliged me to leave them. Indeed, my dear
Celia, I felt there would be a great
impropriety
in endeavouring to cultivate an intimacy
with Mrs. Kingly, for
should
she
not have
been acquainted with the connection that
formerly
subsisted
between her
husband
and
myself
, and
should
by any means hereafter
hear of it,
she
might naturally
suppose
I
cultivated
her acquaintance, that I might the
more
easily
enjoy her
husband
's
society
; and
if, as I
suspect
,
she
already knows how near
we were being united by the
tenderest
ties,
she
would certainly approve a conduct,
which would
shew
how much her
happiness
was preferred to my own gratification. I
will
consess
I
wished
for nothing more than
a
conversation
with Kingly, for I plainly
perceived
some
mystery
couched beneath the
few
sentences
that
passed
, while we were at
breakfast
: But this
wish
I was
sensible
would
be both improper and imprudent to
seek
to
gratify. Mrs. Kingly having therefore
named
a day, when
she
thought it would be
convenient
for her aunt to
see
me, and
mentioned
an hour when
she
would call and take
me to her, I took my leave. I
slightly
regarded
Kingly's countenance, as I
wished
him good morning, and
discovered
in it
strong
traits of wonder and impatience.
When I teturned to Mrs. Sidney's, Amelia
discovered
by my looks the agitation of my
mind. I thought it would be wrong to have
Vol. II. L
any concealments from
such
worthy friends,
I therefore briefly related all that concerned
Rainsforth, and my unfortunate rencounter
with him that morning. Upon my word,
Meriel,
said
she
, every word you utter
excites
fresh
wonder. I remember hearing
of the affair you mention, but it was always
spoken
of in
such
a ludicrous
strain
, that I
have
myself
frequently joined in the laugh
against
you,
considering
you as a poor, fond
girl, who fancied every man who but
spoke
a civil word was in love with you, and
returned
this imaginary
passion
with all the
enthusiastic
ardor of romantic affection. I
made
Miss
Sidney no
answer
, but going to
my trunk, returned with all the letters which
had
passed
between Rainsforth and
myself
.
This proof of your fortitude and
magnanimity
,
said
she
, when
she
had
perused
them, was only wanting to complete my
esteem
for your character; for, it is from
these
letters only, that I have learnt in what
manner you
disposed
of your fortune.
Generous
,
noble
spirited
girl, it is only for
such
hearts as yours to be tried in the ordeal of
affliction
;
but
surely
heaven has
some
future
reward in
store
, that will amply
compensate
the
sufferings
you are ordained to endure.
Oh! my dear Amelia,
said
I, have
I not already an ample
compensation
in your
friendship
and affection.
Praises
from your
lips are balm to my wounded heart: may I
never forfeit your
esteem
. That I am
sure
you never will. I only
blush
to think
how long I remained a
stranger
to your
merits
;
but the real diamond is always
enveloped
in a
crust
, thro' which it is only on
near
inspection
, we can
discover
its
intrinsic
value. Ah! flatterer,
said
I,
smiling
,
while the tear of grateful affection
stole
from
my eye. Oh! Celia, when I forget the
friendship
of Amelia Sidney, the benefits
received
from her hands, the
misery
from
which
she
snatched
me, may I be forgot by
that Providence to whom we can only look
for
support
.
Bless
her, all-bounteous
heaven
;
make her felicity as
boundless
as the
benevolence of her heart; let her comforts
be many, and her afflictions few: and when
this
transitory
scene
is
past
,
soft
and gentle
be her
passage
to the grave. May
she
Peaceful
sleep
out the
sabbath
of the
tomb,
And wake to raptures in a life to come.
Pope
.
And may you, my dear Celia,
share
the
same
envied fate. For me, I was born to
bustle
on a
sea
of trouble; and
so
as the
busfetting
waves do not deprive me of the
support
held out by the heavenly cherub
Hope, I have
still
a comfort remaining, that
will bear me up under all my troubles, and
lead me to a harbour of eternal
rest
. Adieu,
my friend, I will continue my narrative in a
few days.
MERIEL.
LETTER XXXVI.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London
,
March
14
th
, 1781.
Knowing
, my dear Celia's
impatience
to be informed of what followed
my interview in Golden-Square, I
shall
proceed
without any preface.
After the
conversation
I mentioned in my
last
, it
struck
Amelia that Kingly would
undoubtedly
endeavour to
see
me, as his mind
must
be in the
same
state
of painful
uncertainty
in regard to my conduct, as I was,
when I reflected on his. I told her I would
by no means
wish
to
see
him, and
requested
the
servant
might be permitted to deny me
in
case
any gentleman
should
call. Our
measures
were but
just
settled
when a knock
at the door announced a
visitor
, and by
listning
at the top of the
stair
-
case
, I plainly
heard Kingly's voice. He
seemed
much
disappointed
at not finding me at home, and
left word he would call at twelve o'clock the
next day: accordingly I wrote the
following
note to be delivered when he came.
TO MR. KINGLY.
MISS HOWARD's compliments to Mr.
Kingly;
requests
as a particular favour, he
will not give
himself
the trouble to call any
more, as Mr. Kingly cannot be ignorant,
that there are many forcible
reasons
existing
,
which renders it totally improper for
Miss
H.
to recieve his
visits
. She
desires
no
explanation
of
past
incidents;
sincerely
wishes
Mr. K. every felicity; but is certain any
intercourse
between them, will not tend to
promote it. It is that
reason
only, which
urges
Miss
H. to avoid an intimacy with
L 2
the very amiable Mrs. Kingly,
whose
happiness
,
she
devoutly prays may be
permanent
,
and of long duration.
When he came, this note was delivered
to him by the
servant
. He
asked
for pen
and ink, and left the following.
TO MISS HOWARD.
I AM convinced I have been decieved;
an explanation is
absolutely
necessary
to my
repose
. I find you are the
same
charming,
delicate girl, I once adored; nay, which
even at this moment I find dearer to my
heart, than aught the world contains
beside
.
Then, think not, I will
sit
tamely down,
while you
suppose
me an unfeeling,
capricious
monster
. There is one way, by which
I can clear
myself
; there is one, who can
plead my
cause
, and you not
refuse
to
listen
.
I
respect
that
sense
of propriety, which urges
you to
refuse
a
personal
interview; but I
must
be
restored
to your
esteem
, or be
wretched for ever. Your friend,
F. KINGLY.
The next morning Mrs. Kingly called as
she
had appointed, and took me with her
in the chariot to Mrs.
Rooksby
. This old
lady is extremely
pleasing
in her manner.
Her
person
, tho' advanced in years, retains
many traces of grace and elegance. She
expressed
her approbation of me, in the
politest
terms, and
said
,
she
should
consider
herself
extremely fortunate in the
acquisition
of
such
a companion. Her terms were
much more liberal than I had been led to
expect; and as we were
soon
agreed,
she
requested
me to appoint an early day for my
removal to her
house
.
Business
of a very
particular nature,
said
she
, required my
presence
in London, which I have not
visited
before for upwards of twenty years, nor
shall
I now remain in it long; but while I
do
stay
, I
shall
wish
to enter into a few of
its
amusements
, and I am certain I
shall
receive
double
satisfaction
from them all, when
I am favoured with your company. It was
then determined, that day week
should
be
the time of my removal, and we took our
leave. When I was again in the carriage
with Mrs. Kingly,
she
said
, it gives me
great
pleasure
to find my aunt is likely to
make
so
agreeable an addition to her family;
nor have I the
least
doubt, but you will be
satisfied
with your
situation
, as
she
is a
woman
of an
easy
, chearful
disposition
. And
now my dear
Miss
Howard, as we have
settled
this important
business
, you
must
give
me leave to execute a
commission
, I
yesterday
undertook. I have a letter for you,
continued
she
,
smiling
. You may perhaps
guess
from whom. Come, no drawing back,
I can
assure
you there will not be the
least
impropriety in your recieving it, and I
flatter
myself
I have
interest
sufficient
to
obtain
an
answer
. She then put the letter
into my hand. You may judge my
confusion
.
It was
impossible
to
speak
, for I was
utterly at a
loss
what to
say
. I believe, I
never looked more like a fool. Mrs.
Kingly
saw
my
embarrassment
, and kindly, did not
seem
to expect me to
speak
, but began a
conversation
on things quite foreign to the
subject
. When we arrived at Mrs. Sidney's
door,
she
refused
to alight; but
wishing
me
a good day,
said
,
she
should
expect to hear
from me
soon
.
I ran up
stairs
to Amelia, and putting the
letter into her hand, cried, open it, read it
for me, for indeed I have not
resolution
to
read it
myself
.
Enclosed
my dear Celia, is
a copy of the letter;
also
of one from Mrs.
Kingly, in which it was
enclosed
; when you
have
perused
them, I am
sure
you will
lament
with your poor friend, that
such
merit
as Rainsforth's, (for
still
I love that name,)
should
be
severed
from her, by the malice of
those
, who could really reap no advantage
from her
disappointment
. Whatever were
the motives, that
instigated
the
Mossops
to
practice
such
an
imposition
on us both, they
are undoubtedly
disappointed
; for from the
time of Rainsforth's marriage with
Miss
Kingly he carefully avoided all
intercourse
with the family; the
reasons
for which you
will find in his letter. I think when you
have read, you will admire Mrs. Kingly as
much as you pity your
MERIEL.
LETTER XXXVII.
MRS. KINGLY to MISS HOWARD.
March
9
th
, 1781.
I feel
, my dear
Miss
Howard, that I am
under an
indispensible
necessity
of
writing
to you, to
request
you will attend to the
explanation
so
ardently
desired
by Mr.
Kingly
;
and from which your rigid
sense
of
propriety, urges you to recede: but in what
manner
shall
I
address
you, dear, amiable
young lady, when I am
sensible
I have, tho'
unknowingly,
stepped
between you and
happiness
.
Often have I heard your name, oft
listened
to your commendations, from lips
which never
spoke
, but they conveyed
pleasure
to my heart.
My father's family lived in terms of the
greatest
intimacy with that of Mr.
Rainsforth's
;
Frederic and
myself
were nearly of
the
same
age, were frequently together, we
learnt to dance at the
same
school
, and at
our annual ball I was always
selected
for his
partner. Our infantine attachment was
noticed
by both our parents, and Frederic was
often
smilingly
called my little
husband
. As
we
increased
in years, this attachment grew
weaker on the part of Frederic, but in my
bosom
it gathered new
strength
; the many
good qualities
so
conspicuous
in the boy,
became dignified virtues in the
bosom
of
the man. I always wept when duty called
him from his native place, and rejoiced
unfeignedly
at his return. When my uncle
made me his
heiress
, my parents began to
shew
some
disapprobation
of my
visible
partiality
;
and when I repeatedly
refused
the
most
splendid
offers, treated my
passion
with
a rigour, which
served
only to make its
impression
on my heart more indeliable.
Just
before old Mr. Rainsforth met with the
misfortune
,
which was, I
understand
, the
first
cause
of your
separation
from his
son
. I
lost
both my parents within a very
short
period
of each other, and became my own
mistress
:
I know not how to proceed, I am at
a
loss
for words, in which I can
acknowledge
a
weakness
, which I fear you will
condemn
;
but anxious to
restore
peace to the
bosom
of Rainsforth and
prosperity
to his
family; and perfectly unacquainted with his
engagements to the amiable
Miss
Howard,
I
so
far
overstepped
the bounds
prescribed
our
sex
, as to write to him making a tender
of
myself
and fortune:
instead
of writing an
answer
to this letter, he came
himself
,
thanked
me in the
tenderest
manner for what he
termed my generous
designs
in his favour;
but declared his heart was under a prior
engagement. He then expiated largely on
the virtues of
Miss
Howard, and declared,
tho' for the
present
, fortune had placed
insuperable
barriers to
obstruct
your union,
he
should
ever hold
himself
as bound to you,
and while you remained
single
,
consider
himself
not at liberty to marry any other
woman
.
He
requested
that tho' unable to
accept
the offered honour of my hand, he
might not be deprived of my
friendship
, and
declared he
should
always think on me with
gratitude and affection.
From this time I
sedulously
endeavoured
to conquer a
passion
, which I found preyed
upon my peace of mind, and when I heard
of the fortune left his family flattered
myself
I had
succeded
: I
sincerely
rejoiced in
the
prospect
of his felicity in an union with
you, which he told me would now
soon
be
compleated: but one morning he came to
me in
visible
agitation, and taking my hand,
cried, dear Margaret, I am
disappointed
in
my
tenderest
hopes, Meriel Howard is
married
.
I tried to
persuade
him he had been
misinformed
; but he
said
there was no room
for doubt, as it had been confirmed by your
own hand. He now
visited
me every day,
and I will
confess
to you, I exerted
myself
to divert his melancholy; I in
some
measure
succeeded
; and one day as we were
chatting
together on indifferent
subjects
, he
suddenly
caught my hand and cried, if my
lovely friend would accept the offer of a heart
that was once devoted to another,
happiness
might yet be my portion; but I dare not
indulge
so
sweet
a hope. I will not repeat
to you,
Miss
Howard, the many
conversations
we had on this
subject
;
suffice
it to
say
we were
soon
united. From that happy
moment, his
tenderness
, his
assiduity
, has
every day
increased
: I
saw
his heart
still
beat true to its
first
attachment; but I
also
saw
his
struggles
to
suppress
its emotions.
He never indulged
himself
in talking of you,
carefully avoiding every place where he
might chance to hear your name mentioned.
The violent agitation, which you was thrown
into by his entering the room the other
morning
,
and an exclamation which broke from
him, as he caught you, when you were falling
to the ground, made me readily conceive who
it was I had the honour to entertain. I felt for
you both, more than I can
express
: I had long
been acquainted with your virtues, though a
Vol. II. M
stranger
to your
person
, and I
wished
earnestly
for power to aleviate
sufferings
, of
which I
considered
myself
the
cause
.
I
easily
understood
your generous motive
for declining
visiting
at my
house
. I
esteem
,
I venerate you for it, tho' I am certain no
ill
consequence
could
ensue
from an intimacy
between two hearts
so
chaste
,
so
much under
the guidance of religion and honour, as
your's and Mr. Kingly's. The day after I
first
had the
pleasure
of
seeing
you, I
perceived
Mr. Kingly to be melancholy and
absent
.
I
pressed
to know the
cause
. He was
at
first
embarrassed
; at length he candidly
told me he
wished
much for a
conversation
with you, to clear up
some
mysteries
which
at
present
tormented him beyond
measure
;
that he had called on you twice, but you
absolutely
refused
to
see
him. He then
shewed
me your note, and
asked
, if he were to
write a few lines, whether I would prevail
with you to read them, and grant him an
answer
.
I readily
promised
him to comply
with this
request
, and I hope, my dear
Miss
Howard, you will by an
answer
,
restore
peace
to his
bosom
; for I am well convinced, he
will never be happy while he imagines you
think him unworthy your regard. I am,
dear young lady, with every
sentiment
of
esteem
,
and every kind
wish
for your
happiness
,
Your friend in
sincerity
,
M. KINGLY.
LETTER XXXVIII.
MR. KINGLY to MISS HOWARD.
March
9
th
, 1781.
That
you are
still
unmarried, my dear
Meriel, is to me the
cause
of great
astonishment
;
that you are
depressed
in your
circumstances
, and obliged to
seek
by
servitude
the
necessary
means to
support
life,
gives the
accutest
pangs to a heart, that ever
wished
and would have rejoiced in your hap
piness
. I fear we have both been deceived;
but why that deceit has been
practised
against
us, I am at a
loss
to think. I know you
never
were a favourite with the
Mossop
's.
They envied virtues they had not
spirit
to
imitate; but why they
should
thus labour
to render two unoffending beings
so
completely
miserable
, is altogether
unaccountable
.
I have, my dear friend, (the
blush
of
shame
crimsons
my cheek while I write it)
but I have doubted your virtues. I have
thought you
false
, capricious, light and
undeserving
:
and much I fear, you have been
taught to think me the
vilest
of my
sex
. But
let me
hasten
to exculpate
myself
from
so
black a charge. Let me trace back to the
time that even at this moment my
soul
shudders
to think upon. Let me lead your ideas
back to the letter
[1]
[1]
See Vol, I. p. 152.
I wrote informing you of
the happy change in my father's fortune. I
was
hastily
preparing to come to London,
from which place unavoidable
business
had
detained me much longer than my
impatience
could well brook; when one morning
I met young
Mossop
, who at that time
belonged
to a
ship
lying at Plymouth. After
the
usual
salutations
, he
asked
me if I had
that morning any letters from London. I
replied, I had been from home all the
morning
.
You will, no doubt, on your return,
find letters,
said
he; for I have
just
heard
from
Hester
, who mentions having
seen
her
cousin
, and that
she
was employed in writing
to you. My heart
sunk
, my dear Meriel,
at this intelligence; for, as in my letter I
had mentioned the time I
should
leave
Plymouth
,
I did not expect an
answer
, and
naturally
thought, it
must
have been
something
particular had
occasioned
your writing.
I left
Mossop
and
instantly
returned home;
where I found a letter, the contents of which
had nearly fired my brain. It is indeliably
imprinted on my memory; it can never be
forgotten.
These
were the words:
SIR,
THE receipt of your
last
favour,
occasioned
a mixture of both pain and
pleasure
in
my
bosom
. I was extremely happy to hear
of your
increase
of fortune; but pained to
find you
still
retained your partiality for me.
Absence
, my good
sir
, and a variety of
incidents
,
has entirely obliterated from my
heart, every trace, of what I once called
love. But I find I was deceived, in
supposing
myself
actuated by that
passion
. I
shall
ever remember Mr. Rainsforth with the
most
grateful
esteem
; but my heart, and
M 2
all its
tenderest
affections, are devoted to
another object; to whom, to-morrow
morning
I mean to plight my faith, in the
most
solemn
manner. I imagined a knowledge
of this event, would prevent your intended
journey to the metropolis. I
should
be
greatly obliged, if you would
seal
up all my
letters and give them to my
cousin
Mossop
,
who will
send
them to town in a parcel to
his
sister
. At the
same
time,
please
to
inform
me whether you would
wish
yours to
be returned, or whether I have your
permission
to
consign
them to eternal oblivion.
I
sincerely
wish
you may meet with a
woman
,
more calculated to make you happy,
than was the woman, who now, for the
last
time,
signs
herself
,
MERIEL HOWARD.
I cannot give you the
least
idea of the
poignancy o my feelings, or the
madness
of
my actions, at this cruel,
insulting
letter. I
was
absolutely
frantic: my father
endeavoured
to
sooth
me. He had always
expressed
a
dislike
at my
proposed
union with you, tho'
for what
reason
I never could learn. He
told me I ought to rejoice at having
discovered
your light, changeable
disposition
,
before it was in your power to injure my
honour. I
listned
to him with reverence;
I knew he never yet had
expressed
a
wish
,
which did not ultimately tend to my good:
I endeavour to calm my
transports
, and
strove
to
persuade
myself
I
should
soon
hate
you. I wrote you a long letter, wherein I
gave vent to the
anguish
of my heart. I
then
sealed
up all the dear pledges of your
affection, and which till that moment had
been
preserved
as the
choicest
treasures
I
possessed
, and went to
seek
Mossop
.
You did not tell me,
said
I, your
cousin
Meriel was married. Dear
Rainsforth
,
said
he, I had not courage to
inform
you of her perfidy, as I knew you
loved
the unworthy girl. She has
desired
,
said
I, to have her letters returned;
here they are: you are to
send
them to your
sister
. Oh!
Mossop
, I could not have
believed
Meriel HowardI am
sorry
,
said
he, interrupting me, I had not
before
warned you of her
disposition
. She
always was of a fickle temper, I could have
told you of many
instances
of her levity of
heart, which
she
so
effectually hides under
an affectation of
sentiment
and
reserve
; but
you were
so
bigoted to her, you would not
have believed my
assertions
. He then told
me, you were once attached to a married man,
one Pringle, whom he was intimate with in
London; that you eloped from your
father's
house
, and it was to be feared you
had
reason
to repent your
rashness
.
Consummate
hypocrite,
said
I. But from
this moment I
erase
her from my heart; I
will never
suffer
myself
to mention her name;
I will be happy,
spite
of her cruel arts to
undermine my peace.
From that time I carefully avoided, even
the
society
of
Mossop
,
least
I
should
hear
your name, and be tempted to break my
resolves
; and in a very
short
time I yeilded
to the entreaties of my friends, and gave my
hand to the lovely, amiable woman, whom
you have
seen
, and whom I am
sure
you
love; for her
soul
is congenial with your
own. Meriel, I will not pretend to
say
I
had forgot you; but the engaging qualities
of my wife, the innocent beauties of my
children had in a great
measure
, filled that
void in my heart, which the
loss
of you had
occasioned
. Indeed, I had began to fancy
myself
happy, when your
presence
and
sudden
illness
, the other morning, awakened
my long
stifled
tenderness
, convinced me I
had been deceived, and that we both were
destined
to be
miserable
.
My wife, the
best
, the
kindest
of her
sex
,
see
's my
sufferings
, and
generously
pitties
them. Ah! my dear friend, how are
thosesufferings
augmented, when I reflect that
the
anguish
which
oppresses
me, is conveyed
to her gentle
bosom
, and
she
pines in
secret
at the want of that ardent affection, which
would
constitute
the whole
happiness
of her
life.
She has
promised
me, to deliver this to
your hands;
matchless
tenderness
! let her
soft
pleadings prevail my dear
Miss
Howard;
write to me, if it is but one line, to
say
you
do not quite
despise
me. Tell me
also
,
whether you wrote that cruel letter; and if
you did, what were your
reasons
for it.
But, ah! it is
impossible
, you are the
same
charming, amiable woman, I once adored
beyond life, and
whose
image only the pang
that
disolves
every tie of nature, can
erase
from my heart.
Oh! Margret, thou much
esteemed
woman
,
pardon
these
involuutary wanderings
of my pen, I would die rather than injure
you: this once forgive my wayward heart,
and henceforth my every hour of life
shall
be devoted to thee. Meriel, dear
lost
Meriel,
if you
wish
to
save
me from
distraction
,
write one line of comfort to the wretched
F. KINGLY.
MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.)
CAN you concieve, my dear Celia, the
poignancy of my feelings when I had read
this horrid detail of the
imposition
that had
been
practised
, thus to ruin the peace of
Kingly and
myself
.
Hester
Mossop
was the
person
, my
suspicions
rested
on, yet why
she
should
endeavour to undermine my
happiness
,
when it would by no means conduce
either to her
interest
or felicity remains
still
an inexplicable riddle. I cannot tell you
how often I read the dear letter which
undecieved
me, in regard to Kingly's conduct;
how often I
pressed
it to my heart, and
bathed
it in my tears: amiable youth, charming
engaging woman, cried I, as I alternately
read the letters of Frederic and his
Margaret
;
may your
happiness
be as complete as
you are
deserving
: never will Meriel
abuse
the confidence you have placed in her. My
resolution
in what manner to conduct
myself
was
soon
formed. I determined to
answer
Kingly's letter, and to commit it
unsealed
to
the care of his amiable wife; I laid my
projected
plan before the friendly Amelia, and
finding it met her approbation,
immediately
sat
down to put it in execution;
the following is a copy of my letter to
Kingly
.
MISS HOWARD to MR. KINGLY.
SIR,
HAD not the letter I have
just
perused
been written in your hand, and delivered to
me by Mrs. Kingly, I
should
be tempted to
think
some
whining
school
boy had tried the
extent of his genius in its
composition
. In
the name of common
sense
, my good friend,
to what do
these
piteous complaints tend, or
from whence do they proceed? are you not
the
husband
of a woman, every way
calculated
to make the connubial
state
a
state
of
bliss
? have you not two lovely children, the
pledges of her
tenderest
affections; and has
not Providence bountifully
showered
its
favours
on you? have you not health,
ease
and plenty? and yet
simple
mortal, that
you are, do you complain and
sigh
,
because
you were not permitted to unite your fate
with one, who, if you knew her half
so
well
as I do, you would find entirely
destitute
of
many of
those
amiable qualities which
so
eminently
distinguish
Mrs. Kingly. For
shame
Kingly, for
shame
, you
almost
tempt
me to laugh; your
present
conduct is like that
of a
spoilt
child, who having in his
possession
every valuable elegant toy his indulgent
parents
can procure him, by chance
discovers
an
insignificant
trifle, which at
some
past
period
had
amused
his fancy; but being now
out of his reach, he raves, blubbers and roars,
throws from him with wild
impetuosity
,
those
already in his
possession
, and with the
right, wayward
spirit
of contradiction
refuses
to be pacified. You are
mistaken
in
supposing
young
Mossop
decieved you in
regard
to my character; nature formed me
thoughtless
, volatile and capricious: It is
true, while you remained with me, I
restrained
my natural levity; but no
sooner
were
you
absent
than I
relapsed
into my former
folly, and innumerable are the giddy
inconsistent
actions I have committed; among
which, no doubt you will reckon my
writing
such
an unaccountable letter, merely to
try the
strength
of your
passion
; to be
sure
, I
did not think you would have
resented
it
so
highly; but when I found that my folly
was the means of promoting your
interest
,
I heartily rejoiced in your felicity, nor once
wished
to recall the
transaction
.
You are in another error in
supposing
me
unhappy. I am one of
those
thoughtless
,
inconsiderate
beings, who
seldom
lay any
thing long to heart. My fortune is gone,
it is true; but, it was
disposed
of in
such
a
way, as I can never repent. My health and
spirits
are
still
unimpaired; then
consider
,
my good friend, how little I have to regret,
how much to be thankful for. It has
struck
me,
since
our interview in Golden-Square,
that you might, perhaps, imagine my
illness
was
occasioned
by your
sudden
appearance.
Do not encourage that idea; it is a
false
one.
I am
sometimes
subject
to
those
kind of fits;
and they generally
seize
me without a
moment's
warning.
I flatter
myself
you will now be
satisfied
.
Be
assured
, there is nothing can give me
greater
pleasure
, than to
see
you and the
lovely woman to whom your fate is united,
enjoy uninterrupted felicity; for volatile and
giddy as I am, I have yet a heart that exults
in the
prosperity
of every
surrounding
object
.
Believe me, Kingly, true felicity is
placed within your reach, take the proffered
blessing
, and enjoy it with gratitude, nor let
your own
discontented
fancies
dash
with gall
the cup which Providence
presents
,
overflowing
with joy and peace. From the
tenor
of your letter, I
should
think you a hero
of romance, lamenting in pathetic
strains
the
disappointment
of his
first
love. Pr'ythee,
my good friend,
shake
off the boy,
assume
the man of
sense
, and learn to
estimate
true
happiness
, not by the
inconsistent
wishes
of
Vol. II. N
your wayward heart, but by its own
intrinsic
value. Adieu, and believe me your
sincere
well
wisher
.
MERIEL HOWARD.
I will not pretend to tell you, what pain it
cost
me, my dear Celia, to write a letter
so
foreign to my feelings: to be obliged, as it
were, to
accuse
myself
of folly and
inconsistency
;
that would render me contemptible
in the eyes of the only man, to whom I
wished
to appear amiable. But there was no
other way to
restore
his peace, there was no
other way to
preserve
the
happiness
of a
woman
,
who not only loved him with the
most
enthusiastic
passion
, but had placed an
unbounded
confidence in me, and
shewn
a
friendship
for me, which I
should
have
ceased
to
deserve
, could I once have been
so
mean
as to envy her the
possession
of the man, who
constituted
the whole of her earthly felicity.
But tho' I
wished
Kingly to remain in his
error, I could not bear to be thought
meanly
of by this dear woman; I therefore took
an opportunity, when I thought it
most
likely
he would not be at home, and waited on
Mrs. Kingly. I gave her the letter, but at
the
same
time told her, tho' I
wished
her
husband
to think my
assertions
true, I hoped
she
would kindly believe I was not indeed
the very
inconsistent
character I had
represented
myself
, I then
presented
to her a
paper
,
briefly containing every
circumstance
which had
passed
between Kingly and
myself
,
and
enclosing
the letter I had received,
as I imagined, from his father. She read
them with attention, and then declared it
was not old Mr. Rainsforth's writing;
said
she
knew his hand perfectly well, and
also
,
that he was a man incapable of writing
so
inhuman a letter. That there has been a
strange
deception
practised
, is very evident,
my dear madam,
said
I, but I make no
doubt you will join me in thinking, it will be
much better to conceal it from Mr. Kingly,
as he would undoubtedly think as an officer
and as a man of honour, he was under a
necessity
of
resenting
the ungenerous conduct
of Mr.
Mossop
. Dear,
considerate
girl,
said
she
, taking my hand, how do you
contrive
to
rise
every moment higher in my
esteem
.
It appears a degree of cruelty to
suffer
Mr. Kingly to retain
such
an erroneous
opinion of your conduct. But I
must
insist
, my dear madam,
said
I, on your
keeping my
secret
. Remember it was on the
promise
of inviolable
silence
alone that I
entrusted
you. But, cried
she
, tenderly,
I fear you are unhappy. Indeed, I am
not, I replied. Since
those
occurrences I
have
just
related to you, I have had
so
many
trials,
so
many heavy afflictions, that I had
seldom
thought on Mr. Rainsforth within
these
last
two years, except it was to rejoice,
that by not being united to me, he had
escaped
a large
share
of
sorrow
, as he would
unavoidably have taken a part in all my
afflictions
.
Ah! deceiver,
said
she
,
smiling
,
you cannot
persuade
me, that the
heart once tenderly attached to
such
a man
as Kingly, can
so
easily
regain its
tranquility
.
But you do not reflect, my dear
madam
,
that I thought him a
false
hearted
swain
, and
strove
with a laudable pride to
banish
him from my remembrance. True,
she
replied, but you are now undeceived.
Well, but believe me, it was too late to
awaken the long
stifled
passion
. My heart
is
just
in the
situation
it was before I
saw
him.
Nay, I really think it is
easier
; for I am now
convinced that he is not altogether
unworthy
the
happiness
that awaits him. I then
purposely
changed the
conversation
,
enquired
when
she
had
seen
her aunt, and how long
that lady thought of remaining in town.
I long to go into the country,
said
I,
for there never was a woman
so
passionately
fond of
still
life as I am; I doat on a
gloomy grotto; and a moonlight night,
with a nightingale under my window, and a
streamlet
just
near enough for its murmurs
to be agreeable, fills me with delight.
You are of a melancholy turn then,
said
she
.
By no means, I replied, I am the
chearfulest
creature breathing when free
from
noise
and
bustle
; but if you
wish
to
see
me completely
stupid
,
usher
me into a
crowded
drawing-room, my faculties immediately
take their flight, and I appear what I am in
reality, a mere cypher to fill up the number
of the company.
I
wish
,
said
she
, our
house
in
Devonshire
was near my aunt's, I
should
, I am
very
certain,
pass
many a happy hour in your
society
.
You are at a great
distance
from her
then? So far, that we
seldom
meet
above
once in a year. This information
pleased
me, you may be
sure
, my dear Celia,
for I
wish
not to be often in company with
Kingly. However, I did not
express
my
satisfaction
,
and Mrs. Kingly continued. Even
when I do
visit
Mrs.
Rooksby
, I take an
opportunity
when Mr. Kingly is from home:
for he has
such
an invincible
aversion
to her
son
, that he will never, if he can
possibly
N 2
avoid it,
spend
an hour in his company.
Does Mr.
Rooksby
live with his mother?
said
I.
Not in general, but in the
summer
season
he frequently makes her a
visit
of
some
months continuance,
especially
if his finances
run
short
. Clement, continued
she
, is
not a bad hearted lad, but he is
thoughtless
and extravagant; and what offends Mr.
Kingly
so
highly is, he has an intrigue with
a woman
supposed
to be married. Her
influence
over him is
astonishing
, and her
extravagance
knows no bounds; the
connection
,
I believe, has been of long duration;
but he has not publicly avowed it till within
these
two months.
Business
for his mother
took him to the continent, and when he
returned
she
accompanied him. It is a
great pity,
said
I. But at that moment
hearing Kingly's voice in the hall, I
arose
to
take my leave; and as he entered the room
I left it.
To-morrow, my dear Celia, I take leave
of the amiable, friendly Amelia, and her
worthy mother, and enter into Mrs.
Rooksby's
family. I am happy to find her
son
is
not much at home, as I have met with
so
many vexations from the unmeaning
assiduities
of the men, that I
wish
to avoid as much
as
possible
all
intercourse
with the
sex
: for
except Kingly, I can hardly believe there is a
good one in the world. There was another,
Celia, but he is now no more. Dear
shade
of the benevolent,
disinterested
Welldon, if
from thy
blissful
abode thou
couldst
, now
look down, and behold the heart thy virtue
snatched
from ruin, thou
wouldst
see
it
overflowing
with
such
grateful remembrance,
such
veneration and affection, as nothing but
the hand of death can
extinguish
. Adieu!
my dear Celia, I will write again when I can
tell you how I like my
situation
.
MERIEL.
LETTER XXXIX.
MERIEL to CELIA.
London,
April 20th,
1781.
I have
now been in this family nearly a
month, and feel
myself
as happy as you
can imagine, by
contrasting
my
present
with
my late
friendless
and
desolate
condition.
Mrs.
Rooksby
has
seen
a good deal of
company
since
I have been with her, and goes
frequently into public. I find, my dear
Celia
,
that
sensibility
is not always an object of
ridicule; for Mrs.
Rooksby
and Mrs. Kingly
can
shed
tears at a tragedy without
endeavouring
to conceal, or
blush
for their
weakness
.
I have received
several
very genteel
presents
from the
last
mentioned lady, and
whenever her aunt
spends
a day with her in
Golden-Square, I take that opportunity to
visit
Miss
Sidney, and
so
avoid a meeting
which I am
sensible
cannot be very
desirable
to any of the parties.
I have not as yet
seen
Mr.
Rooksby
, but
this evening his mother has a rout previous
to her leaving town, and
she
informs me he
will certainly be their. The good old lady
pathetically laments her
sons
unfortunate
attachment,
says
,
she
is certain, from good
information, that he is the dupe of an artful
designing
woman. She has caught him
in her deep laid
snare
,
said
she
, and he
holds
himself
bound to her by gratitude and
honour; for I am convinced real affection
had little or no
share
in
first
forming the
connection. He
first
became acquainted
with her at Oxford, where
she
passed
for the
wife of an old
counsellor
. Her form, I am
told, is very lovely, and it could not be
supposed
that a lad of nineteen,
should
repulse
,
or fly the advances of a beautiful
accomplished
woman. When he came to town
she
left
her
husband
and two lovely children, and
followed him, when a lodging was taking
for her a few miles from London. When
he went to the continent
she
met him at
Dover, and
insisted
on going with him, and
during their journey, the infatuated boy
consented
to her returning and living
publicly
with him in a
house
he has taken for
the
purpose
.
He has been acquainted with her
some
years, then,
said
I. It is above three
years,
she
replied,
since
he
first
saw
her.
It is really a
sad
thing, my dear Celia,
that an abandoned woman
should
prey upon
the fortune and
destroy
the peace of this
young man: yet if the tears and intreaties
of a fond mother cannot break the fatal
charm that holds him,
sure
every other
effort
will be ineffectual. But now my friend,
I
must
throw
aside
my pen, and be fine lady
enough to declare it is for the
purpose
of
dressing
, I begin to
wish
we were in the
country, I am already
sick
of parade,
shew
and farce; for really a
fashionable
life is
nothing better. How
tiresome
to be plagued
with the civil howdye's of fifty women,
who are
immensely
happy to hear you are
well, and would
say
, with the
same
sang
froid,
they were
immensely
sorry
if they were told
you were dead. Oh what a
miserable
figure
I
should
make in the
beau monde
.
21t.
Really this Mr.
Rooksby
is a very
tolerable
being, and if I did not begin to fear he
may be the
cause
of future vexation to me
I
should
like to
pass
an hour or two in his
company, now and then well enough. This
morning at
breakfast
Mrs.
Rooksby
said
how happy my dear
Miss
Howard,
should
I
be, if your charms and engaging qualities
were to draw Clement from his unhappy
engagement
;
I have indulged the
most
pleasing
hopes from
some
expressions
of admiration
and
surprise
, which broke from him on
being
introduced to you
last
night. They
were merely words of
course
, madam,
said
I,
smiling
, when he knew I was
honoured with your approbation, he could
not be
so
wanting in
politeness
as to
express
any
dislike
. But what will you
say
my
dear,
she
replied, when I tell you he has
absolutely
engaged
himself
to dine with me
to day, a favour he has not
vouchsafed
above
twice
since
I came to town. We will
hope, madam, he is returning to a proper
sense
of his duty.
Ah! Meriel, I
wish
he may entertain
a proper
sense
of your merit; how happy
should
I be in
such
a daughter; how certain
would he be of
happiness
, if
blessed
with
such
a wife. Dear madam, you over
power me; you over rate my merits, and
indeed I feel it is
impossible
I
should
ever
love any man
sufficient
to become his wife.
Come,
said
she
, be candid, you
cannot
forget Kingly. Indeed, madam, if I
know my own heart, it never yet harboured
an improper
wish
; I
esteem
both Mr. and
Mrs. Kingly, but I
should
be extremely
sorry
to
see
any misfortune
dissolve
their union,
but let us drop the
subject
, I
wish
to remain
single
; let me only enjoy your
friendship
my
dear madam, and I
shall
be the
happiest
creature on earth.
At dinner time Mr.
Rooksby
arrived. I
endeavoured to be
unembarrassed
in my
manner, but after what had
passed
in the
morning it was
impossible
. He was
attentively
polite; but I
saw
his dear mother
watch every look, and
smile
approbation,
whenever any thing
escaped
him that could
be
construed
into
tenderness
. She
pressed
me to play and
sing
:
some
little drawings
too, which
she
has honoured by hanging in
the drawing-room, were
submitted
to his
inspection
. They are
vastly
well
executed
,
said
he. Clara draws very prettily.
I hope,
said
his mother, you do not
make
comparisons
.
Assuredly
I do, he
replied
hastily
, but every
comparison
must
only convince me of
Miss
Howard's evident
superiority
, not only in every virtue, but in
every
accomplishment
. I hope, my dear
Celia, this young man will not take it into
his head to fancy
himself
in love with me.
I never can like him;
besides
, I am
determined
never to marry. Adieu, my dear
friend, I
wish
I was in the convent with you;
but it was not my fate to
pass
a
serene
,
unruffled
life, and I
must
be as patient as I can
till my hour of
rest
arrives. Every your's,
MERIEL.
