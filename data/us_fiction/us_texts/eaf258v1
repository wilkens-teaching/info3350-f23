PILGRIM OF OUTRE-MER.

THE
PILGRIM OF OUTRE-MER.
I am a Palmer, as ye se,
Whiche of my lyfe muche part have spent,
In many a fayre and farre cuntrie,
As pilgrims do of good intent.
The Four P's.
`
Lystenyth
ye godely gentylmen, and all
that ben hereyn!' I am a pilgrim benighted
on my way, and crave a shelter till the storm
is over, and a seat by the fireside in this
honorable
company. As a stranger I claim this
courtesy at your hands; and will repay your
hospitable welcome with tales of the countries
I have passed through in my pilgrimage.
This is a custom of the olden time. In the
days of Chivalry and romance, every baron
bold, perched aloof in his feudal castle,
welcomed
the stranger to his halls, and listened
with delight to the pilgrim's tale, and the song
of the troubadour. Both pilgrim and
troubadour
had their tales of wonder from a distant
land, embellished with the magic of oriental
exaggeration. Their salutation was,
`Lordyng lysnith to my tale,
That is meryer than the nightingale.'
The soft luxuriance of the eastern clime
bloomed in the song of the bard; and the wild
and romantic tales of regions so far off, as to be
regarded as almost a fairy land, were well suited
to the childish credulity of an age, when what
is now called the old world was in its
childhood
.
Those times have passed away. The
world has grown wiser and less credulous;
and the tales, which then delighted, delight no
longer. But man has not changed his nature.
He still retains the same curiositythe same
love of noveltythe same fondness for
romance
,
and tales by the chimney cornerand
the same desire of wearing out the rainy day
and the long winter evening with the illusions of
fancy, and the fairy sketches of the poet's
imagination
.It
is as true now as ever, that
`Off talys, and tryfulles, many man tellys;
Sume byn trew, and sume byn ellis;
A man may dryfe forthe the day that long tyme dwellis
Wyth harpyng and pipyng, and other mery spellis,
Wyth gle, and wyth game.'
The
Pays d'Outre-Mer,
or the Land
beyond
the Sea, is a name by which the pilgrims
and crusaders of old usually designated the
Holy
Land. I, too, in a certain sense, have been
a pilgrim of Outre-Mer; for to my youthful
imagination the old world was a kind of Holy
Land, lying afar off beyond the blue horizon of
the ocean; and when its shores first rose upon
my sight, looming through the hazy atmosphere
of the sea, my heart swelled with the deep
emotions of the pilgrim, when he sees afar the
spire which rises above the shrine of his
devotion
.
In this my pilgrimage I have passed many
lands, and countries, and searched many full
strange places. I have traversed France from
Normandy to Navarre;smoked my pipe in a
Flemish inn;floated through Holland in a
Trekschuit;
trimmed my midnight lamp in a
German university; wandered and mused
amid the classic scenes of Italy; and listened
to the gay guitar and merry castanet on the
borders of the blue Guadalquiver. The
recollection
of many of the scenes I have passed
through is still fresh in my mind; whilst the
memory of others is fast fading away, or is
blotted
out forever. But now I will stay the too
busy hand of time, and call back the shadowy
past. Perchance the old and the wise may
accuse
me of frivolity; but I see in this fair
company
the bright eye and listening ear of youth,
an age less rigid in its censure and more
willing to be pleased. To gentlewomen and
their loves is consecrated all the wooing
language
,
allusions to love-passions, and sweet
embracements feigned by the muse, mongst
hills and rivers;whatsoever tastes of
description
,
battell, story, abstruse antiquity, and
law of the kingdome, to the more severe critic.
To the one, be contenting enjoyments of their
auspicious desires: to the other, a happy
attendance
of their chosen muses.

THE
NORMAN DILIGENCE.
Crack, crack,crack, crack;what a fuss thou makest?as if it
concerned the good people to be informed, that a man with a pale face
and clad in black, had the honor to be driven into Paris at nine o'clock
at night, by a postillion in a tawny yellow jerkin, turned up with red
calamanco!

THE
NORMAN DILIGENCE.
The French guides, otherwise called the Postilians, have one most
diabolicall custome in their travelling upon the wayes. Diabolicall it
may be well called: for whensoever their horses doe a little anger them,
they will say in their fury
Allons diable,
that is, go thou divel. This
I know by mine own experience.
Coryat's Crudities
.
It was early in the leafy month of June,
that I travelled through the beautiful province
of Normandy. As France was the first foreign
country I visited, every thing wore an air of
freshness and novelty, which pleased my eye,
and kept my fancy constantly busy. Life was
like a dream. It was a luxury to breathe again
the free air, after having been so long cooped
up at sea: and, like a long-imprisoned bird let
loose from its cage, my imagination revelled in
the freshness and sunshine of the morning
landscape.
On every side, valley and hill were covered
with a carpet of soft velvet green. The birds
were singing merrily in the trees, and the
landscape
wore that look of gaiety so well
described
in the quaint language of an old romance,
making the sad, pensive, and aching heart to
rejoice, and to throw off mourning and
sadness
.
Here and there a cluster of chesnut
trees shaded a thatch-roofed cottage, and
little
patches of vineyard were scattered on the
slope of the hills, mingling their delicate green
with the deep hues of the early summer grain.
The whole landscape had a fresh, breezy look.
It was not hedged in from the highways, but
lay open to the eye of the traveller, and
seemed
to welcome him with open arms. I felt less
a stranger in the land: and as my eye traced
the dusty road winding along through a rich
cultivated country, and skirted on either side
with blossomed fruit trees, and occasionally
caught glimpses of a little farm-house resting
in a green hollow, and lapped in the bosom of
plenty, I felt that I was in a prosperous,
hospitable
,
and happy land.
I had taken my seat on top of the
Diligence
,
in order to have a better view of the
country. It was one of those ponderous
vehicles
,
which totter slowly along the paved
roads of France, laboring beneath a mountain
of trunks and bales of all descriptions, and, like
the Trojan horse, bore a groaning multitude
within it. It was a curious and cumbersome
machine, resembling the bodies of three
coaches
placed upon one carriage, with a cabriolet
on top for outside passengers. On the pannels
of each door were painted the
fleurs-de-lis
of
France, and upon the side of the coach
emblazoned
in golden characters: Exploitation
Gnrale des Messageries Royales des
Diligences
pour le Havre, Rouen et Paris.
It would be useless to describe the motley
groups, that filled the four quarters of this
little world. There was the dusty
tradesman
,
with green coat and cotton umbrella;
the sallow invalid, in skull-cap, and cloth
shoes; the priest in his cassock; the peasant
in his frock; and a whole family of squalling
children. My fellow travellers on top were a
gay subaltern, with fierce mustaches, and a
nut-brown village beauty of sweet sixteen.
The subaltern wore a military undress, and a
little blue cloth cap in the shape of a
cow-bell
,
trimmed smartly with silver lace, and
cocked on one side of his head. The
brunette
was decked out with a staid white
Norman
cap, nicely starched and plaited, and
nearly three feet high; a rosary and cross
about her neck; a linsey-woolsey gown, and
wooden shoes.
The personage who seemed to rule this
little
world with absolute sway, was a short
pursy
man, with a busy, self-satisfied air, and
the sonorous title of
Monsieur le Conducteur
.
As insignia of office, he wore a little round fur
cap, and fur-trimmed jacket; and carried in his
hand a small leathern port folio, containing his
way-bill. He sat with us on top of the
Diligence
,
and with comic gravity issued his
mandates
to the postillion below, like some petty
monarch speaking from his throne. In every
dingy village we thundered through, he had a
thousand commissions to execute and to
receive
:
a package to throw out on this side,
and another to take in on that: a whisper for
the landlady at the inn: a love-letter and a
kiss for her daughter: and a wink, or a snap
of his fingers for the chamber-maid at the
window. Then there were so many questions
to be asked and answered, while changing
horses! Every body had a word to say. It
was
Monsieur le Conducteur
!
here;
Monsieur
le Conducteur
!
there. He was in complete
bustle; till at length crying
en route!
he
ascended
the dizzy height and we lumbered away
in a cloud of dust.
But what most attracted my attention was
the grotesque appearance of the postillion and
the horses. He was a comical looking little
fellow, already past the heyday of life, with a
thin, sharp countenance, to which the smoke
of tobacco and the fumes of wine had given
the dusty look of wrinkled parchment. He
was equipped in a short jacket of purple velvet,
set off with a red collar, and adorned with
silken
cord. Tight pantaloons of bright yellow
leather arrayed his pipe-stem legs, which were
swallowed up in a huge pair of wooden boots,
iron-fastened, and armed with long, rattling
spurs. His shirt-collar was of vast
dimensions
,
and between it and the broad brim of his
high, bell-crowned, varnished hat, projected
an eel-skin queue, with a little tuft of frizzled
hair, like a powder-puff at the end, bobbing
up and down with the motion of the rider, and
scattering a white cloud around him.
The horses, which drew the Diligence, were
harnessed to it with ropes and leather, and in
the most uncouth manner imaginable. They
were five in number:black, white, and gray;
as various in size as in color. Their tails were
braided and tied up with wisps of straw; and
when the postillion mounted and cracked his
heavy whip, off they started, one pulling this
way, another that; one on the gallop, another
trotting and the rest dragging along at a
scrambling pace, between a trot and a walk.
No sooner did the vehicle get comfortably in
motion, than the postillion, throwing the reins
upon his horse's neck, and drawing a flint and
steel from one pocket, and a short-stemmed
pipe from another, leisurely struck fire, and
began
to smoke. Ever and anon some part of
the rope harness would give way;
Monsieur
le Conducteur
from on high would thunder
forth an oath or two; a head would be popped
2
out at every window: half a dozen voices
exclaim
at once, what's the matter? and the
postillion, apostrophizing the
diable
as usual,
thrust his long whip into the leg of his boot,
leisurely dismount, and drawing a handful of
packthread from his pocket, quietly set himself
to mend matters in the best way possible.
In this manner we toiled slowly along the
dusty highway. Occasionally the scene was
enlivened by a group of peasants, driving
before
them a little ass, laden with vegetables for
a neighboring market. Then we would pass a
solitary shepherd, sitting by the road-side,
with a shaggy dog at his feet, guarding his
flock, and making his scanty meal on the
contents
of his wallet; or perchance a little
peasant
girl, in wooden shoes, leading a cow, by a
cord attached to her horns, to browse along
the side of the ditch. Then we would all
alight to ascend some formidable hill on foot,
and be escorted up by a clamorous troop of
sturdy mendicants,annoyed by the ceaseless
importunity of worthless beggary, or moved
to pity by the palsied limbs of the aged, and
the sightless eyeballs of the blind.
Occasionally, too, the postillion drew up in
front of a dingy little cabaret, completely
overshadowed
by wide-spreading trees. A lusty
grape-vine clambered up beside the door; and
a pine bough was thrust out from a hole in the
wall, by way of tavern bush. Upon the front
of the house was generally inscribed in large
black letters; ICI ON DONNE A BOIRE ET A
MANGER
;
ON LOGE A PIED ET A CHEVAL; a sign
which may be thus paraphrased; Good
Entertainment
for man and beast; but which
was once translated by a foreigner, Here they
give to eat and drink; they lodge on foot and
on horse-back!
Thus one object of curiosity succeeded
another; hill, valley, stream and woodland
flitted by me like the shifting scenes of a
magic
lantern, and one train of thought gave place
to another; till at length in the after part of
the day, we entered the broad and shady
avenue
of fine old trees, which leads to the
western
gate of Rouen, and a few moments
afterwards
,
were lost in the crowds and confusion
of its narrow streets.

.
Je veux absolument un Lion d'Or; parce qu'on
dit, O allez-vous? Au Lion d'Or!D'o venez-vous? Du Lion d'Or!
O irons-nous? Au Lion d'Or!O y a-t-il de bon vin? Au Lion
d'Or!
La Rose Rouge.
This
answer of Monsieur Vinot must have
been running in my head, as the Diligence
stopped at the Messagerie; for when the
porter
,
who took my luggage, said;
O allez-vous, Monsieur?
I answered, without thinking, (for be it
said with all the veracity of a traveller, at that
time I did not know there was a Golden Lion
in the city)
Au Lion d'Or.
And so to the Lion d'Or we went.
The hostess of the Golden Lion received me
with a courtesy and a smile, rang the house-bell
for a servantand told him to take the
gentleman's
things to No. 35. I followed him up
stairs. Onetwothreefourfivesix
seven! Seven stories highby our Lady!
I counted them every one;and when I went
down to remonstrate, I counted them again;
so that there was no possibility of a mistake.
When I asked for a lower room, the hostess
told me the house was full; and when I spake
of going to another hotel, she said she should
be so very sorry, so
dsole,
to have Monsieur
leave her, that I marched up again to No. 35.
After finding all the fault I could with the
chamber, I ended, as is generally the case with
most men on such occasions, by being very
well pleased with it. The only thing I could
possibly complain of, was my being lodged in
the seventh story, and in the immediate
neighborhood
of a gentleman who was learning to
play the French horn. But to remunerate me
for these disadvantages, my window looked
down into a market-place, and gave me a
distant
view of the towers of the Cathedral, and
the ruins of the church and Abbey of
Saint-Ouen
.
When I had fully prepared myself for a
ramble through the city, it was already
sundown
;
and after the heat and dust of the day,
the freshness of the long evening twilight
was delightful. When I enter a new city, I
cannot rest till I have satisfied the first
cravings
of curiosity by rambling through its
streets. Nor can I endure a Cicerone, with his
eternal This way, Sir. I never desire to be
led directly to an object worthy of a traveller's
notice, but prefer a thousand times, to find my
own way, and come upon it by surprise. This
was particularly the case at Rouen. It was
the first European city of importance that I
visited. There was an air of antiquity about
the whole city, that breathed of the Middle
Ages; and so strong and delightful was the
impression, that it made upon my youthful
imagination
,
that nothing, which I afterwards
saw, could either equal or efface it. I have
since passed through that city; but I did
not stop. I was unwilling to destroy an
impression
,
which, even at this distant day, is as
fresh upon my mind, as if it were of yesterday.
With these delightful feelings I rembled on
from street to street, till at length after
threading
a narrow alley, I unexpectedly came out
in front of the magnificent Cathedral. If it
had suddenly risen from the earth, the effect
could not have been more powerful and
instantaneous
.
It completely overwhelmed my
imagination
;
and I stood for a long time
motionless
,
and gazing entranced upon the stupendous
edifice. I had seen no specimen of gothic
architecture
before, save the remains of a little
church at Havre; and the massive towers
before
methe lofty windows of stained glass
the low portal, with its receding arches and
rude statuesall produced upon my
untravelled
mind an impression of awful sublimity.
When I entered the church, the impression
was still more deep and solemn. It was the
hour of vespers. The religious twilight of the
placethe lamps that burned on the distant
altar
the
kneeling crowdthe tinkling bell
and the chaunt of the evening service, that
rolled
along the vaulted roof in broken and
repeated
echoesfilled me with new and intense
emotions. When I gazed on the stupendous
architecture of the churchthe huge columns,
3
that the eye followed up till they were lost in
the gathering dusk of the arches abovethe
long and shadowy aislesthe statues of saints
and martyrs, that stood in every recessthe
figures of armed knights upon the tombsthe
uncertain light, that stole through the painted
windows of each little chapeland the form of
the cowled and solitary monk, kneeling at the
shrine of his favorite saint, or passing
between
the lofty columns of the church,all I
had read of, but had not seen,I was
transported
back to the Dark Ages, and felt as I
shall never feel again.
On the following day I visited the remains
of an old palace, built by Edward the Third,
now occupied as the Palais de Justice; and the
ruins of the church and monastery of Saint
Antoine
.I
saw the hole in the tower where the
ponderous bell of the Abbey fell through;and
took a peep at the curious illuminated
manuscript
of Daniel d'Aubonne in the public
library
.
The remainder of the morning was
spent in visiting the ruins of the ancient Abbey
of St. Ouen, which is now transformed into the
Hotel de Ville, and in strolling through its
beautiful gardens, dreaming of the present and
the past, and given up to a melancholy of my
own.
At the
Table d' Hte
of the Golden Lion,
I fell into conversation with an elderly
gentleman
,
who proved to be a great antiquarian, and
thoroughly read in all the forgotten lore of the
city. As our tastes were somewhat similar,
we were soon upon very friendly terms; and
after dinner, we strolled out to visit some
remarkable localities, and took the
gloria
together
in the Chevalier Bayard.
When we returned to the Golden Lion he
entertained me with many curious stories of
the spots we had been visiting. Among others
he related the following singular adventure of
a monk of the Abbey of Saint Antoine, which
amused me so much, that I cannot refrain
from presenting it to my readers. I will not,
however, vouch for the truth of the story; for
that the antiquarian himself would not do. He
said he found it in an ancient manuscript of the
Middle Ages, in the archives of the public
library
,
and I give it as it was told me, without
note or comment.

MARTIN FRANC
AND
THE MONK OF SAINT ANTHONY.
Quoth hee, heer is a chaunce for the nones,
For heer hangeth the false Munk by cocks bones.
The Mery Jest of Dane Hew
.
In
times of old there lived in the city of
Rouen a tradesman, named Martin Franc,
who, by a series of misfortunes, had been
reduced
from oppulence to poverty. But poverty,
which generally makes men humble and
laborious
,
only served to make him proud and lazy:
and in proportion as he grew poorer and poorer,
he grew also prouder and lazier. He
contrived
,
however, to live along from day to day, by
now and then pawning a silken robe of his wife,
or selling a silver spoon, or some other trifle
saved from the wreck of his better fortune;
and passed his time pleasantly enough in
loitering about the market place, and walking
up and down on the sunny side of the street.
The fair Marguerite, his wife, was
celebrated
through the whole city for her beauty, her
wit, and her virtue. She was a brunette, with
the blackest eyethe whitest teethand the
ripest nut-brown cheek in all Normandy;her
figure was tall and statelyher hands and feet
most delicately mouldedand her swimming
gait like the motion of a swan. In happier days
she had been the delight of the richest
tradesmen
in the city, and the envy of the fairest
dames; and when she became poor, her fame
was not a little increased by her cruelty to
several substantial burghers, who, without
consulting their wives, had generously offered
to stand between her husband and
bankruptcy
,
and do all in their power to raise a worthy
and respectable family.
The friends of Martin Franc, like the
friends of many a ruined man before and since,
deserted him in the day of adversity. Of all
that had eaten his dinners, and drunk his wine,
and philandered with his wife, none sought the
narrow alley and humble dwelling of the
broken
tradesman, save one; and that one was
Friar Gui, the sacristan of the Abbey of Saint
Anthony. He was a little, jolly, red-faced
friar, with a leer in his eye, and rather a
naughty
reputation for a man of his cloth; but as he
was a kind of travelling gazette and always
brought the latest news and gossip of the city,
and besides was the only person that
condescended
to visit the house of Martin Franc,
in fine, for the want of a better, he was
considered
in the light of a friend.
In these constant assiduities, Friar Gui had
his secret motives, of which the single heart
of Martin Franc was entirely unsuspicious.
The keener eye of his wife, however, soon
discovered two faces under the hood. She
observed that the Friar generally timed his
visits so as to be at the house when Martin
Franc was not at home,that he seemed to
prefer the edge of the evening,and that as
his visits became more frequent he always had
some little apology ready, such as `being
obliged
to pass that way, he could not go by the
door without just dropping in to see how the
good man Martin did.'Occasionally, too, he
ventured to bring her some ghostly present
such as a picture of the Madonna and child,
or one of those little naked images, which
are hawked about the streets at the Nativity.
Though the object of all this was but too
obvious
,
yet the fair Marguerite perserved in
misconstruing the Friar's intentions, and in
dexterously
turning aside any expressions of
gallantry
that fell from his venerable lips. In this
way Friar Gui was for a long time kept at
bay; and Martin Franc preserved in the day
of poverty and distress, that consolation of all
this world's afflictionsa friend. But finally
things came to such a pass that the honest
tradesman opened his eyes, and wondered he
had been asleep so long. Whereupon he was
irreverend enough to tweak the nose of Friar
Gui, and then to thrust him into the street by
the shoulders.
Meanwhile the times grew worse and
worse. One family relic followed another;
the last silken robe was pawned:the last
silver spoon sold; until at length poor Martin
Franc was forced to `drag the devil by the
4
tail;'in other words, beggary stared him full
in the face. But the fair Marguerite did not
even then despair. In those days a belief in
the immediate guardianship of the saints, was
much more strong and prevalent than in these
lewd and degenerate times; and as there
seemed no great probability of improving
their condition by any lucky change, which
could be brought about by mere human
agency
,
she determined to try what could be done
by intercession with the patron saint of her
husband. Accordingly she repaired one
evening
to the Abbey of Saint Anthony, to place a
votive candle and offer her prayer at the altar,
which stood in the little chapel dedicated to
Saint Martin.
It was already sun-down when she reached
the church, and the evening service of the
Virgin had commenced. A cloud of incense
floated before the altar of the Madonna, and
the organ rolled its deep melody along the dim
arches of the church. Marguerite mingled
with the kneeling crowd, and repeated the
responses in Latin, with as much devotion, as
the most learned clerk of the convent. When
the service was over, she repaired to the chapel
of Saint Martin, and lighting her votive tapes
at the silver lamp, which burned before his
altar, knelt down in a retired part of the
chapel
,
and, with tears in her eyes, besought the
saint for aid and protection. Whilst she was
thus engaged, the church became gradually
deserted, till she was left, as she thought,
alone. But in this she was mistaken; for
when she arose to depart, the portly figure of
Friar Gui was standing close at her elbow!
A fair, good evening to my lady
Marguerite
,
said he significantly. Saint Martin has
heard your prayer, and sent me to relieve your
poverty.
Then, by the Virgin! replied she, the
good saint is not very fastidious in the choice
of his messengers.
Nay, good wife; answered the Friar,
not at all abashed by this ungracious reply;
if the tidings are good, what matters it who
the messenger may be?And how does
Martin Franc, these days?
He is well, Sir Gui; replied
Marguerite
;
and were he present, I doubt not
would thank you heartily for the interest you
still take in him and his poor wife.
He has done me wrong; continued the
Friar, without seeming to notice the
pointedness
of Marguerite's reply. But it is our
duty to forgive our enemies; and so let the
past be forgotten. I know that he is in want.
Here, take this to him, and tell him I am still
his friend.
So saying, he drew a small purse from the
sleeve of his habit, and proffered it to his
companion
.I
know not whether it were a
suggestion
of Saint Martin, but true it is, that the
fair lady of Martin Franc seemed to lend a
more willing ear to the earnest whispers of the
Friar. At length she said;
Put up your purse; to-day I can neither
deliver your gift nor your message. Martin
Franc has gone from home.
Then keep it for yourself.
Nay, Sir Monk; replied Marguerite,
casting down her eyes; I can take no bribes
here in the church, and in the very chapel of
my husband's patron saint. You shall bring
it to me at my house, an' you will, Sir Gui.
The Friar put up the purse, and the
conversation
,
which followed, was in a low and
indistinct
undertone, audible only to the ears for
which it was intended. At length the interview
ceased; and,O Woman! the last words that
the virtuous Marguerite uttered, as she glided
from the church, were;
To-night;when the Abbey clock strikes
twelve!remember!
It would be useless to relate how
impatiently
the Friar counted the hours and the
quarters, as they chimed from the ancient
tower of the Abbey, whilst he paced to and
fro along the gloomy cloister. At length the
appointed hour approached; and just before
the convent bell sent forth its summons to call
the friars of Saint Anthony to their midnight
devotions, a figure, with a cowl, stole out of a
postern gate and passing silently along the
deserted streets, soon turned into the little
alley, which led to the dwelling of Martin
Franc. It was none other than Friar Gui.
He rapped softly at the tradesman's door;
and casting a look up and down the street, as if
to assure himself that his motions were
unobserved
,
slipped into the house.
Has Martin Franc returned? enquired
he in a whisper.
No; answered the sweet voice of his
wife; he will not be back to night.
Then all good angels befriend us!
continued
the monk, endeavoring to take her hand.
Not so, Sir Monk, said she, disengaging
herself. You forget the conditions of our
meeting.
The Friar paused a moment; and then
drawing a heavy leathern purse from his girdle,
he threw it upon the table. At the same
moment
a footstep was heard behind him, and a
heavy blow from a club threw him prostrate
upon the floor. It came from the strong arm
of Martin Franc himself!
It is hardly necessary to say that his
absence
was feigned. His wife had invented the
story to decoy the lecherous monk, and thereby
to keep her husband from beggary and to
relieve
herself, once for all, from the
importunities
of a false friend. At first Martin Franc
would not listen to the proposition; but at
length he yielded to the urgent entreaties of
his wife; and the plan finally agreed upon
was, that Friar Gui, after leaving his purse
behind him, should be sent back to the convent
with a severer discipline than his shoulders had
ever received from any penitence of his own.
The affair, however, took a more serious
turn than was intended; for when they tried to
raise the Friar from the ground,he was dead.
The blow aimed at his shoulders fell upon his
shaven crown; and in the excitement of the
moment Martin Franc had dealt a heavier stroke
than he intended. Amid the grief and
consternation
,
which followed this discovery, the quick
imagination of his wife suggested an
expedient
of safety. A bunch of keys at the Friar's
girdle caught her eye. Hastily unfastening
the ring, she gave the keys to her husband,
exclaiming
;
For the holy Virgin's sake, be quick! One
of these keys unlocks the postern gate of the
convent garden. Carry the body thither, and
leave it among the trees!
Martin Franc threw the dead body of the
monk across his shoulders, and with a heavy
heart took the way to the abbey. It was a
clear starry night; and though the moon had not
yet risen, her light was in the sky, and came
reflected down in a soft twilight upon earth.
Not a sound was heard through all the long
and solitary streets, save at intervals the distant
crowing of a cock, or the melancholy hoot of
an owl from the lofty tower of the abbey.
The silence weighed like an accusing spirit
upon the guilty conscience of Martin Franc.
He started at the sound of his own breathing,
as he panted under the heavy burden of the
monk's body; and if perchance a bat flitted
near him on drowsy wings, he paused, and his
heart beat audibly with terror: such cowards
does conscience make of even the most
courageous
.
At length he reached the garden wall
of the abbey,opened the postern gate with
the key, and bearing the monk into the garden,
seated him upon a stone bench by the edge of
the fountain, with his head resting against a
column, upon which was sculptured an image
of the Madonna. He then replaced the bunch
of keys at the monk's girdle, and returned
home with hasty steps.
When the Prior of the convent, to whom
the repeated delinquencies of Friar Gui were
but too well known, observed that he was
again absent from his post at midnight prayers,
he waxed exceedingly angry; and no sooner
were the duties of the chapel finished, than he
sent a monk in pursuit of the truant sacristan,
summoning him to appear immediately at his
cell. By chance it happened, that the monk,
chosen for this duty, was a bitter enemy of
Friar Gui; and very shrewdly supposing that
the sacristan had stolen out of the garden gate
on some midnight adventure, he took that
direction
in pursuit. The moon was just
climbing
the convent wall, and threw its silvery light
through the trees of the garden, and on the
sparkling waters of the fountain, that fell with
a soft lulling sound into the deep basin below.
As the monk passed on his way, he stopped to
quench his thirst with a draught of the cool
water, and was turning to depart when his eye
caught the motionless form of the sacristan,
sitting erect in the shadow of the stone column.
How is this, Friar Gui? quoth the monk.
Is this a place to be sleeping at midnight,
when the brotherhood are all in their
dormitories
?
5
Friar Gui made no answer.
Up, up!thou eternal sleeper, and do
penance
for thy negligence. The prior calls for
thee at his cell! continued the monk, growing
angry, and shaking the sacristan by the
shoulder
.
But still no answer.
Then by Saint Anthony I'll wake thee!
So, so! Sir Gui!
And saying this he dealt the sacristan a heavy
box on the ear. The body bent slowly
forward
from its erect position, and giving a
headlong plunge, sank with a heavy splash
into the basin of the fountain. The monk
waited a few moments in expectation of
seeing
Friar Gui rise dripping from his cold
bath, but he waited in vain;for he lay
motionless at the bottom of the basinhis eyes
open, and his ghastly face distorted by the
ripples of the water. With a beating heart the
monk stooped down and grasping the skirt of
the sacristan's habit, at length succeeded in
drawing him from the water. All efforts,
however, to resuscitate him were unavailing.
The monk was filled with terror, not doubting
that the Friar had died untimely by his hand;
and as the animosity between them was no
secret in the convent, he feared that, when the
deed was known, he should be accused of
wilful
murder. He therefore looked round for an
expedient to relieve himself of the dead body;
and the well-known character of the sacristan
soon suggested one. He determined to carry
the body to the house of the most noted beauty
of Rouen, and leave it on the door stop so
that all suspicion of the murder might fall
upon the shoulders of some jealous husband.
The beauty of Martin Franc's wife had
penetrated
even the thick walls of the convent, and
there was not a friar in the whole Abbey of
Saint Anthony who had not done penance for
his truant imagination.Accordingly the dead
body of Friar Gui was laid upon the monk's
brawny shoulders,carried back to the house
of Martin Franc, and placed in an erect
position against the door. The monk knocked
loud and long; and then gliding through a
bylane
,
stole back to the convent.
A troubled conscience would not suffer
Martin Franc and his wife to close their eyes;
but they lay awake lamenting the doleful
events of the night. The knock at the door
sounded like a death-knell in their ears. It still
continued at intervals, rapraprap!with a
dull, low sound,as if something heavy were
swinging against the pannel; for the wind had
risen during the night and every angry gust
that swept down the alley, swung the arms of
the lifeless sacristan against the door. At
length Martin Franc mustered courage enough
to dress himself and to go down, whilst his wife
followed him with a lamp in her hand; but no
sooner had he lifted the latch, than the
ponderous
body of Friar Gui fell stark and heavy into
his arms.
Jesu Maria! exclaimed Marguerite,
crossing herself;here is the monk again!
Yes, and dripping wet, as if he had just
been dragged out of the river!
O we are betrayedbetrayed! exclaimed
Marguerite in agony.
Then the devil himself has betrayed us;
replied Martin Franc, disengaging himself from
the embrace of the sacristan; for I met not a
living being; the whole city was as silent as
the grave.
Holy Saint Martin defend us!
continued
his terrified wife. Here, take this
scapulary
to guard you from the evil one;and
lose no time. You must throw the body into
the river; or we are lost! Holy Virgin!
How bright the moon shines!
Saying this she threw round his neck a
scapulary
with
the figure of a cross on one end
and an image of the Virgin on the other, and
Martin Franc again took the dead Friar upon
his shoulders and with fearful misgivings
departed
on his dismal errand. He kept as
much as possible in the shadow of the houses,
and had nearly reached the quay, when
suddenly
,
he thought he heard footsteps behind
him.He stopped to listen; it was no
mistake
they
came along the pavement, tramp!
tramp! and every step grew louder and
nearer. Martin Franc tried to quicken his
pace;but in vain;his knees smote together,
and he staggered against the wall. His hand
relaxed its grasp; and the monk slid from his
back, and stood ghastly and straight beside
him, supported by chance against the
shoulder
of his bearer. At that moment, a man
came round the corner, tottering beneath
the weight of a huge sack. As his head
was bent downwards, he did not perceive
Martin Franc, till he was close upon him;
and when, on looking up, he saw two
figures
standing motionless in the shadow of
the wall, he thought himself waylaid, and,
without waiting to be assaulted, dropped the
sack from his shoulders, and ran off at full
speed. The sack fell heavily on the pavement,
and directly at the feet of Martin Franc. In
the fall the string was broken; and out came
the bloody headnot of a dead monk, as it
first seemed to the excited imagination of
Martin Franc,but of a dead hog!When
the terror and surprise caused by this singular
event had a little subsided, an idea came into
the mind of Martin Franc, very similar to what
would have come into the mind of almost any
person in similar circumstances. He took the
hog out of the sack and putting the body of the
monk into its place, secured it well with the
remnants of the broken string; and then
hurried
homeward with the hog upon his
shoulders
.
He was hardly out of sight, when the man
of the sack returned, accompanied by two
others. They were surprised to find the sack
still lying on the ground, with no one near it,
and began to jeer the former bearer, telling
him he had been frightened at his own shadow
on the wall. Then one of them took the sack
upon his shoulders, without the least suspicion
of the change that had been made in its
contents
,
and all three disappeared.
Now it happened that the city of Rouen
was at that time infested by three street robbers,
who walked in darkness like the pestilence, and
always carried the plunder of their midnight
marauding
to the Tte-de-Buf, a little tavern in
one of the darkest and narrowest lanes of the city.
The host of the Tte-de-Buf was privy to all
their schemes, and had an equal share in the
profits of their nightly excursions. He gave a
helping hand, too, by the length of his bills,
and by plundering the pockets of any chance
traveller, that was luckless enough to sleep
under
his roof.
On the night of the disastrous adventure of
Friar Gui, this little marauding party had been
prowling about the city until a late hour,
without finding any thing to reward their
labors
.
At length, however, they chanced to
spy a hog, hanging under a shed in a
butcher's
yard in readiness for the next day's
market
;
and as they were not very fastidious in
selecting their plunder, but on the contrary
rather addicted to taking whatever they could
lay their hands on, the hog was straightway
purloined, thrust into a large sack, and sent to
the Tte-de-Buf on the shoulders of one of the
party, whilst the other two continued their
nocturnal
excursion. It was this person, who had
been so terrified at the appearance of Martin
Franc and the dead monk; and as this
encounter
had interrupted any further operations of
the partythe dawn of day being now near
at hand,they all repaired to their gloomy
den in the Tte-de-Buf. The host was
impatiently
waiting their return; and, asking
what plunder they had brought with them,
proceeded
without delay to remove it from the
sack. The first thing that presented itself, on
untying the string, was the monk's hood.
The devil take the devil! cried the host,
as he opened the neck of the sack, What's
this?Your hog has got a cowl!
The poor devil has become disgusted
with the world, and turned monk! said he,
who held the light, a little surprised at seeing
the head covered with a coarse gray cloth.
Sure enough he has, exclaimed another,
starting back in dismay, as the shaven crown
and ghastly face of the Friar appeared. Holy
Saint Benedict be with us!It is a monk,
stark dead!
A dead monk, indeed! said a third,
with an incredulous shake of the head, How
could a dead monk get into this sack?No,
no: there is some
diablerie
in this. I have
heard it said, that Satan can take any shape
he pleases; and you may rely upon it, this is
Satan himself, who has taken the shape of
a monk to get us all hanged.
Then we had better kill the devil than
have the devil kill us!replied the host,
crossing himself. And the sooner we do it,
the better; for it is now near day-light, and
people will soon be passing in the street.
So say I; rejoined the man of magic;
6
and my advice is to take him to the butcher's
yard, and hang him up in the place where we
found the hog.
This proposition so pleased the others, that
it was executed without delay. They carried
the Friar to the butcher's house, and passing a
strong cord round his neck, suspended him to
a beam in the shed, and there left him.
When the night was at length passed, and
daylight began to peep into the eastern
windows
of the city, the butcher arose, and
prepared
himself for market. He was casting up
in his mind, what the hog would bring at his
stall, when looking upwardlo! in its place
he recognized the dead body of Friar Gui.
By Saint Dennis! quoth the butcher,
I always feared that this Friar would not die
quietly in his cell; but I never thought I
should find him hanging under my own roof.
This must not be; it will be said, that I
murdered
him, and I shall pay for it with my life.
I must contrive some way to get rid of him.
So saying he called his man, and showing
him what had been done, asked him how he
should dispose of the body, so that he might
not be accused of murder. The man, who was
of a ready wit, reflected a moment, and then
answered;
This is indeed a difficult matter; but
there is no evil without its remedy.We will
place the friar on horseback
What!a dead man on horseback?
impossible! interrupted the butcher. Who
ever heard of a dead man on horseback!
Hear me out, and then judge. We must
place the body on horseback, as well as we
may, and bind it fast with cords, and then set
the horse loose in the street, and pursue after
him crying out, that the monk has stolen the
horse. Thus all who meet him will strike him
with their staves, as he passes, and it will be
thought that he came to his death in that way.
Though this seemed to the butcher rather
a mad project, yet, as no better one offered
itself, at the moment, and there was no time
for reflection, mad as the project was, they
determined to put it into execution.
Accordingly
the butcher's horse was brought out, and
the Friar was bound upon his back, and with
much difficulty fixed in an upright position.
The butcher then gave the horse a blow upon
the crupper with his staff, which set him into a
smart gallop down the street, and he and his
man joined in pursuit crying;
Stop thief!Stop thief!The friar has
stolen my horse!
As it was now sunrise the streets were full
of people, peasants driving their goods to
market
,
and citizens going to their daily avocations.
When they saw the Friar dashing at full speed
down the street, they joined in the cry of Stop
thief!Stop that horse! and many, who
endeavored
to seize the bridle as the Friar passed
them at full speed, were thrown upon the
pavement
,
and trampled under foot. Others joined
in the halloo! and the pursuit; but this only
served to quicken the gallop of the frightened
steed, who dashed down one street and up
another like the wind, with two or three
mounted citizens clattering in full cry at his
heels. At length they reached the
market
place.The people scattered right and
left in dismayand the steed and rider
dashed onward, overthrowing in their course
men and women, and stalls, and piles of
merchandise, and sweeping away like a
whirlwind. Tramptramptramp! they
clattered
on; they had distanced all pursuit. They
reached the quay; the wide pavement was
cleared at a boundone more wild leapand
splash!both horse and rider sank into the
rapid current of the riverswept down the
streamand were seen no more!
THE
VILLAGE OF AUTEUIL.
Il n'est tel plaisir
Que d'estre  gsir
Parmy les beaux champs,
L'herbe verd choisir,
Et prendre bon temps.

THE
VILLAGE OF AUTEUIL.
Oyez-vous
Ce bruit tant doux
Dcliquer de la gorgette
Du geai mignot,
Du linot
Et de la frisque allouette?
Bonaventure
Desperriers
.
The
sultry heat of summer always brings
with it, to the idler and the man of leisure, a
longing for the leafy shade and the green
luxuriance
of the country. It is pleasant to
interchange
the din of the city,the movement of
the crowd,and the gossip of society, with the
silence of the hamlet,the quiet seclusion of
the grove, and the gossip of a woodland brook.
As is sung in the old ballad of Robin Hood,
In somer when the shawes be sheyn,
And leves be large and long,
Hit is full mery in feyre foreste,
To here the foulys song.
To se the dere draw to the dale
And leve the hilles hee,
And shadow hem in the leves grene,
Vnder the grene wode tre.
It was a feeling of this kind, that prompted
me during my residence in the north of France
to pass one of the summer months at Auteuil
the pleasantest of the many little villages
that lie in the immediate vicinity of the
metropolis
.
It is situated on the outskirts of the
Bois de Boulogne
a wood of some extent,
in
whose green alleys the dusty cit enjoys the
luxury
of an evening drive, and gentlemen meet in
the morning to give each other satisfaction in
the usual way. A cross road, skirted with
green hedge-rows, and overshadowed by tall
poplars, leads you from the noisy highway of
St. Cloud and Versailles to the still retirement
of this suburban hamlet. On either side, the
eye discovers old chateaux amid the trees, and
green parks, whose pleasant shades recall a
thousand images of La Fontaine, Racine, and
Molire; and on an eminence overlooking the
7
windings of the Seine, and giving a beautiful
though distant view of the domes and gardens
of Paris, rises the village of Passy, long the
residence of our countrymen Franklin and
Count Rumford.
I took up my abode at a
Maison de
Sant
;
not that I was a valetudinarian,but because
I there found some one to whom I could
whisper
,
`How sweet is solitude!' Behind the
house was a garden filled with fruit trees of
various kinds, and adorned with gravel walks,
and green arbors, furnished with tables and
rustic seats, for the repose of the invalid and
the sleep of the indolent. Here the inmates of
the rural hospital met on common ground, to
breathe the invigorating air of morning, and
while away the lazy noon or vacant evening
with tales of the sick chamber.
The establishment was kept by Dr.
Dent-de-lion
,
a dried up little fellow, with red hair,
a sandy complexion, and the physiognomy and
gestures of a monkey. His character
corresponded
to his outward lineaments; for he had
all a monkey's busy and curious impertinence.
Nevertheless, such as he was, the village
sculapius
strutted forth the little great man of
Auteuil. The peasants looked up to him as
to an oracle,he contrived to be at the head
of every thing, and laid claim to the credit
of all public improvements in the village:in
fine he was a great man on a small scale.
It was within the dingy walls of this little
potentate's imperial palace, that I chose my
country residence. I had a chamber in the
second story, with a solitary window, which
looked upon the street, and gave me a peep
into a neighbor's garden. This I esteemed
a great privilege; for, as a stranger, I
desired
to see all that was passing out of doors,
and the sight of green trees, though growing
on another man's ground, is always a blessing.
Within doors,had I been disposed to quarrel
with my household gods,I might have taken
some objection to my neighborhood; for on
one side of me was a consumptive patient,
whose grave-yard cough drove me from my
chamber by day,and on the other, an English
Colonel, whose incoherent ravings, in the
delirium
of a high and obstinate fever, often broke
my slumbers by night. But I found ample
amends for these inconveniences in the society
of those, who were so little indisposed as hardly
to know what ailed them, and those, who in
health themselves, had accompanied a friend or
relative to the shades of the country in pursuit
of it. To these I am indebted for much
courtesy
;
and particularly to one, who, if these
pages should ever meet her eye, will not, I
hope, be unwilling to accept this slight
memorial
of a former friendship.
It was, however, to the
Bois de Boulogne,
that I looked for my principal recreation.
There I took my solitary walk, morning and
evening; or, mounted on a little
mouse-colored
donkey, paced demurely along the
woodland
pathway. I had a favorite seat beneath the
shadow of a venerable oak, one of the few
hoary patriarchs of the wood, which had
survived
the bivouacs of the Allied Armies. It
stood upon the brink of a little glassy pool,
whose tranquil bosom was the image of a quiet
and secluded life, and stretched its parental
arms over a rustic bench, that had been
constructed
beneath it, for the accommodation of
the foot-traveller, or, perchance, some idle
dreamer like myself. It seemed to look round
with a lordly air upon its old hereditary
domain
,
whose stillness was no longer broken by
the tap of the martial drum, nor the discordant
clang of arms; and, as the breeze whispered
among its branches, it seemed to be holding
friendly colloquies with a few of its venerable
cotemporaries, who stooped from the opposite
bank of the pool, nodding gravely now and
then, and ogling themselves with a sigh in the
mirror below.
In this quiet haunt of rural repose, I used
to sit at noon,hear the birds sing, and
possess
myself in much quietness. Just at my
feet lay the little silver pool, with the sky and
the woods painted in its mimic vault, and
occasionally
the image of a bird, or the soft watery
outline of a cloud, floating silently through its
sunny hollows. The water-lily spread its broad
green leaves on the surface, and rocked to
sleep a little world of insect life in its golden
cradle. Sometimes a wandering leaf came
floating and wavering downward, and settled
on the water; then a vagabond insect would
break the smooth surface into a thousand
ripples
,
or a green-coated frog slide from the
bank, and plump!dive headlong to the
bottom
.
I entered, too, with some enthusiasm into
all the rural sports and merrimakes of the
village
.
The holidays were so many little eras
of mirth and good feeling; for the French
have that happy and sunshine temperament
that merry-go-mad character,which makes
all their social meetings scenes of enjoyment
and hilarity. I made it a point never to miss
any of the
Ftes Champtres,
or rural dances,
at the wood of Boulogne; though I confess it
sometimes gave me a momentary uneasiness to
see my rustic throne beneath the oak usurped
by a noisy group of girls, the silence and
decorum
of my imaginary realm broken by music
and laughter, and, in a word, my whole
kingdom
turned topsyturvy, with romping, fiddling,
and dancing. But I am naturally, and from
principle too, a lover of all those innocent
amusements, which cheer the laborer's toil,
and, as it were, put their shoulders to the wheel
of life, and help the poor man along with his
load of cares. Hence I saw with no small
delight
the rustic swain astride the wooden horse
of the
carrousel,
and the village maiden
whirling
round and round in its dizzy car; or took
my stand on a rising ground that overlooked
the dance, an idle spectator in a busy throng.
It was just where the village touched the
outward
border of the wood. There a little area
had been levelled beneath the trees,
surrounded
by a painted rail, with a row of benches
inside. The music was placed in a slight
balcony, built around the trunk of a large tree
in the centre, and the lamps, hanging from the
branches above, gave a gay, fantastic and fairy
look to the scene. How often in such
moments
did I recall the lines of Goldsmith,
describing
those kinder skies, beneath which
France displays her bright domain, and feel
how true and masterly the sketch
Alike all ages; dames of ancient days
Have led their children through the mirthful maze,
And the gay grandsire, skilled in gestic lore,
Has frisked beneath the burden of three-score.
Nor must I forget to mention the
Fte
Patronale
,
a kind of annual fair, which is held
at mid-summer in honor of the patron saint of
Auteuil. Then the principal street of the
village
is filled with booths of every description;
strolling players, and rope-dancers, and
jugglers
,
and giants, and dwarfs, and wild beasts,
and all kinds of wonderful shows excite the
gaping curiosity of the throng, and in dust,
crowds, and confusion the village rivals the
capital
itself. Then the goodly dames of Passy
descend into the village of Auteuil;then the
brewers of Billancourt, and the tanners of
Svres dance lustily under the greenwood tree;
and then, too, the sturdy fish-mongers of
Brtigny and Saint-Yon regale their fat wives
with an airing in a swing, and their customers
with eels and craw-fish;or as is more
poetically
set forth in an old Christmas Carol,
Vous eussiez vu venir tous ceux de Saint-Yon,
Et ceux de Brtigny apportant du poisson,
Les barbeaux et gardons, anguilles et carpettes
Etoient  bon march
Croyez,
A cette journe-l,
La, la,
Et aussi les perchettes.
I found another source of amusement in
observing the various personages that daily
passed and repassed beneath my window. The
character, which most of all arrested my
attention
,
was a poor blind fiddler, whom I first saw
chaunting a doleful ballad at the door of a small
tavern near the gate of the village. He
wore a brown coat out at elbows, the
fragment
of a velvet waistcoat, and a pair of tight
nankeens, so short as hardly to reach below
his calves. A little foraging cap, that had
long since seen its best days, set off an open,
good-humored countenance, bronzed by sun
and wind. He was led about by a brisk middle
aged woman, in straw hat and wooden shoes;
and a little bare-footed boy, with clear blue
eyes and flaxen hair, held a tattered hat in his
hand, in which he collected eleemosynary sous.
The old fellow had a favorite song, which he
used to sing with great glee to a merry, joyous
air, the burden of which ran
chantons
l'amour et le plaisir
!
let us sing of love
and pleasure. I often thought it would have
been a good lesson for the crabbed and
discontented
rich man, to have heard this remnant of
humanity,poor, blind, and in rags, and
dependent
upon casual charity for his daily bread,
singing, in so cheerful a voice, the charms of
8
existence, and, as it were, fiddling life away
to a merry tune.
I was one morning called to my window by
the sound of rustic music. I looked out, and
beheld a procession of villagers advancing
along the road, attired in gay dresses, and
marching merrily on in the direction of the
church. I soon perceived that it was a
marriage
festival. The procession was led by
a long orang-outang of a man, in a straw hat
and white dimity bob-coat, playing on an
asthmatic
clarionet, from which he contrived to
blow unearthly sounds, ever and anon
squeaking
off at right angles from his tune, and
winding
up with a grand flourish on the
guttural
notes. Behind him, led by his little boy,
came the blind fiddler, his honest features
glowing with all the hilarity of a rustic bridal,
and, as he stumbled along, sawing away
upon his fiddle till he made all crack again.
Then came the happy bridegroom, dressed in
his Sunday suit of blue, with a large nosegay
in his button-hole, and close beside him his
blushing bride, with downcast eyes, clad in
a white robe and slippers, and wearing a
wreath of white roses in her hair. The friends
and relatives brought up the procession; and
a troop of village urchins came shouting along
in the rear, scrambling among themselves for
the largess of sous and sugar-plums, that now
and then issued in large handfuls from the
pockets of a lean man in black, who seemed to
officiate as master of ceremonies on the
occasion
.
I gazed on the procession till it was out
of sight; and when the last wheeze of the
clarionet
died upon my ear, I could not help
thinking
how happy were they, who were thus to
dwell together in the peaceful bosom of their
native village, far from the gilded misery and
the pestilential vices of the town.
On the evening of the same day, I was
sitting
by the window, enjoying the freshness of
the air, and the beauty and stillness of the
hour, when I heard the distant and solemn
hymn of the Catholic burial service, at first so
faintly and indistinct that it seemed an illusion.
It rose mournfully on the hush of evening,
died gradually away,then ceased. Then it
rose again, nearer and more distinct, and soon
after a funeral procession appeared, and passed
directly beneath my window. It was led by a
priest, bearing the banner of the church, and
followed by two boys, holding long flambeaux
in their hands. Next came a double file of
priests in white surplices, with a missal in one
hand and a lighted wax taper in the other,
chaunting the funeral dirge at intervals,now
pausing, and then again taking up the
mournful
burden of their lamentation, accompanied
by others, who played upon a rude kind of
horn, with a dismal and wailing sound. Then
followed various symbols of the church, and
the bier, borne on the shoulders of four men.
The coffin was covered with a black velvet pall,
and a chaplet of white flowers lay upon it,
indicating
that the deceased was unmarried. A
few of the villagers came behind, clad in
mourning robes, and bearing lighted tapers.
The procession passed slowly along the same
street, that in the morning had been thronged
by the gay bridal company. A melancholy
train of thought forced itself home upon my
mind. The joys and sorrows of this world are
so strikingly mingled! Our mirth and grief
are brought so mournfully in contact! We
laugh while others weep,and others rejoice
when we are sad! The light heart and the
heavy walk side by side, and go about
together
!
Beneath the same roof are spread the
wedding feast and the funeral pall! The bridal
song mingles with the burial hymn! One goes
to the marriage bed; another to the grave;
and all is mutable, uncertain and transitory!
It is with sensations of pure delight, that I
recur to the brief period of my existence, which
was passed in the peaceful shades of Auteuil.
There is one kind of wisdom, which we learn
from the world, and another kind, which can
be acquired in solitude only. In cities we
study those around us; but in the retirement of
the country we learn to know ourselves. The
voice within us is more distinctly audible in
the stillness of the place; and the gentler
affections
of our nature spring up more freshly in
its tranquillity and sunshine,nurtured by the
healthy principle, which we inhale with the
pure air, and invigorated by the genial
influences
,
which descend into the heart from the
quiet of the sylvan solitude around, and the
soft serenity of the sky above.
JACQUELINE.
When thou shalt see the body put on death's sad and ashy
countenance
,
in the dead age of night, when silent darkness does encompass the
dim light of thy glimmering taper, and thou hearest a solemn bell tolled
to tell the world of it, which now, as it were, with this sound is struck
into dumb attention, tell me if thou canst then find a thought of thine
devoting thee to pleasure and the fugitive toys of life.
Owen Felltham's Resolves

JACQUELINE.
Death lies on her, like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
Shakspeare
.
Dear
mother,is it not the bell I
hear?
Yes, my child; the bell for morning
prayers. It is Sunday to-day.
I had forgotten it. But now all days are
alike to me. Hark! it sounds againlouder
louder. Open the window, for I love the sound.
There; the sunshine and the fresh morning air
revive me. And the church belloh mother,
it reminds me of the holy sabbath mornings
by the Loireso calm, so hushed, so beautiful!
Now give me my prayer-book, and draw the
curtain back that I may see the green trees
and the church spire. I feel better to-day,
dear mother.
It was a bright, cloudless morning in
August
.
The dew still glistened on the trees;
and a slight breeze wafted to the
sick-chamber
of Jacqueline the song of the birds, the
rustle of the leaves, and the solemn chime of
the church-bells. She had been raised up in
bed, and reclining upon the pillow, was
gazing
wistfully upon the quiet scene without.
Her mother gave her the prayer-book and then
turned away to hide a tear that stole down her
cheek.
At length the bells ceased. Jacqueline
crossed herself, kissed a pearl crucifix that
hung around her neck, and opened the silver
clasps of her missal. For a time she seemed
wholly absorbed in her devotions. Her lips
moved,but no sound was audible. At
intervals
the solemn voice of the priest was heard
at a distance, and then the confused responses
of the congregation, dying away in inarticulate
murmurs. Ere long the thrilling chaunt of
the Catholic service broke upon the ear. At
first it was low, solemn, and indistinct;then
9
it became more earnest and entreating, as if
interceding, and imploring pardon for sin;
and then arose louder and louder, full,
harmonious
,
majestic, as it wafted the song of praise
to heaven,and suddenly ceased. Then the
sweet tones of the organ were heard,
trembling
,
thrilling, and rising higher and higher,
and filling the whole air with their rich
melodious
music. What exquisite accords!what
noble harmonies!What touching pathos!
The soul of the sick girl seemed to kindle into
more ardent devotion, and to be wrapt away to
heaven in the full harmonious chorus, as it
swelled onward, doubling and redoubling, and
rolling upward in a full burst of rapturous
devotion
!Then
all was hushed again. Once
more the low sound of the bell smote the air,
and announced the elevation of the host. The
invalid seemed entranced in prayer. Her book
had fallen beside her,her hands were clasped,
her eyes closed,her soul retired within its
secret chambers. Then a more triumphant
peal of bells arose. The tears gushed from
her closed and swollen lids; her cheek was
flushed; she opened her dark eyes and fixed
them with an expression of deep adoration and
penitence upon an image of the Savior on the
cross, which hung at the foot of her bed, and
her lips again moved in prayer. Her
countenance
expressed the deepest resignation. She
seemed to ask only that she might die in peace,
and go to the bosom of her Redeemer.
The mother was kneeling by the window,
with her face concealed in the folds of the
curtain
.
She arose, and, going to the bed-side
of her child, threw her arms around her, and
burst into tears.
My dear mother, I shall not live longI
feel it here. This piercing painat times it
seizes me, and I cannotcannot breathe.
My child, you will be better soon.
Yes, mother, I shall be better soon. All
tears and pain and sorrow will be over. The
hymn of adoration and entreaty I have just
heard, I shall never hear again on earth. Next
sabbath, mother, kneel again by that window
as to-day. I shall not be here, upon this bed
of pain and sickness, but when you hear the
solemn hymn of worship and the
beseeching
tones that wing the spirit up to God,
think, mother, that I am there,with my
sweet sister who has gone before us,kneeling
at our Savior's feet, and happyoh, how
happy
!
The afflicted mother made no reply,her
heart was too full to speak.
You remember, mother, how calmly Amie
died. Poor child, she was so young and
beautiful
!I
always pray, that I may die as she
did. I do not fear death as I did before she
was taken from us. But ohthis painthis
cruel painit seems to draw my mind back
from heaven. When it leaves me I shall die
in peace.
My poor child!God's holy will be
done!
The invalid soon sank into a quiet slumber.
The excitement was over, and exhausted
nature
sought relief in sleep.
The persons, between whom this scene
passed, were a widow and her sick daughter,
from the neighborhood of Tours. They had
left the banks of the Loire to consult the more
experienced physicians of the metropolis, and
had been directed to the
Maison de Sant
at
Auteuil for the benefit of the pure air. But all
in vain. The health of the suffering, but
uncomplaining
patient grew worse and worse, and it
soon became evident that the closing scene was
drawing near.
Of this Jacqueline herself seemed conscious;
and toward evening she expressed a wish to
receive
the last sacraments of the church. A
priest was sent for: and ere long the tinkling of
a little bell in the street announced his approach.
He bore in his hand a silver vase containing
the consecrated wafer, and a small vessel filled
with the holy oil of the extreme unction hung
from his neck. Before him walked a boy
carrying a little bell, whose sound announced
the passing of these symbols of the Catholic
faith. In the rear, a few of the villagers,
bearing
lighted wax tapers, formed a short and
melancholy
procession. They soon entered the
sick chamber, and the glimmer of the tapers
mingled with the red light of the setting sun,
that shot his farewell rays through the open
window. The vessel of oil and the vase
containing
the consecrated wafers were placed
upon the table in front of a crucifix, that hung
upon the wall, and all present excepting the
priest, threw themselves upon their knees. The
priest then approached the bed of the dying
girl, and said in a slow and solemn tone;
The King of kings and Lord of lords has
passed thy threshold. Is thy spirit ready to
receive him?
It is, father.
Hast thou confessed thy sins?
Holy father, no.
Confess thyself, then, that thy sins may
be forgiven, and thy name recorded in the book
of life.
And turning to the kneeling crowd around,
he waved his hand for them to retire, and was
left alone with the sick girl. He seated
himself
beside her pillow, and the subdued whisper
of the confession mingled with the murmur of
the evening air, which lifted the heavy folds of
the curtains and stole in upon the holy scene.
Poor Jacqueline had few sins to confess,a
secret thought or two towards the pleasures
and delights of the world,a wish to live,
unuttered
,
but which to the eye of her
self-accusing
spirit seemed to resist the wise providence
of God;no more. The confession of a meek
and lowly heart is soon made. The door was
again opened;the attendants entered, and
knelt around the bed, and the priest proceeded;
And now prepare thyself to receive with
contrite heart the body of our blessed Lord
and Redeemer.Dost thou believe that our
Lord Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy
Spirit, and born of the Virgin Mary?
I believe.
And all present joined in the solemn
response
I believe.
Dost thou believe that the Father is God,
that the Son is God, and that the Holy Spirit
is God,three persons and one God?
I believe.
Dost thou believe that the Son is seated
on the right hand of the Majesty on high,
whence he shall come to judge the quick and
the dead?
I believe.
Dost thou believe that by the holy
sacraments
of the church thy sins are forgiven thee,
and that thus thou art made worthy of eternal
life?
I believe.
Dost thou pardon, with all thy heart, all who
have offended thee in thought, word or deed?
I pardon them.
And dost thou ask pardon of God and thy
neighbor for all offences thou hast committed
against them, either in thought, word, or deed?
I do!
Then repeat after me; O Lord Jesus, I
am not worthy, nor do I merit, that thy divine
Majesty should enter this poor tenement of
clay; but according to thy holy promises be
my sins forgiven, and my soul washed white
from all transgression.
Then taking a consecrated wafer from the
vase, he placed it between the lips of the
dying
girl, and while the assistant sounded the
little silver bell, said;
Corpus Domini nostri Jesu Christi
custodiat
animam tuam in vitam eternam
.
And the kneeling crowd smote their breasts
and responded in one solemn voice;
Amen!
The priest then took from the silver box on
the table a little golden rod, and dipping it in
holy oil, anointed the invalid upon the hands,
feet and breast in the form of the cross. When
these ceremonies were completed, the priest
and his attendants retired, leaving the mother
alone with her dying child, who, from the
exhaustion
caused by the preceding scene, sank
into a death-like sleep.
`Between two worlds life hovered like a star,
'Twixt night and morn upon the horizon's verge.'
The long twilight of the summer evening
stole on; the shadows deepened without, and
the night-lamp glimmered feebly in the sick
chamber; but still she slept. She was lying
with her hands clasped upon her breast,her
pallid cheek resting upon the pillow, and her
bloodless lips apart, but motionless and silent
as the sleep of death. Not a breath interrupted
the silence of her slumber. Not a movement
of the heavy and sunken eye-lid-not a
trembling
of the lipnot a shadow on the marble
brow told when the spirit took its flight. It
passed to a better world than this.
`There's a perpetual spring,perpetual youth;
No joint-benumbing cold, nor scorching heat,
Famine, nor age have any being there.'

THE
SEXAGENARIAN,
A SKETCH OF CHARACTER.
Youth is full of pleasure,
Age is full of care;
Youth like summer morn,
Age like winter weather;
Youth like summer brave,
Age like winter bare;
Youth is full of sport,
Age's breath is short;
Youth is nimble, age is lame;
Youth is hot and bold,
Age is weak and cold;
Youth is wild, and age is tame.
Shakspeare
.
THE
SEXAGENARIAN.
Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written
down old, with all the characters of age? Have you not a moist eye? a
dry hand? a yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg?
Shakspeare
.
There
he goes,in his long russet surtout,
sweeping down yonder gravel walk beneath
the trees, like a yellow leaf in Autumn, wafted
along by a fitful gust of wind. Now he
pauses
;now
seems to be whirled round in an
eddy,and now rustles and brushes onward
again. He is talking to himself in an
undertone
as usual; and flourishes a pinch of snuff
between his fore-finger and his thumb,ever
and anon drumming on the cover of his box by
way of emphasis, with a sound like the tap of
a wood-pecker. He always takes a morning
walk in the garden,in fact, I may say he
passes
a greater part of the day there, either
strolling up and down the gravel walks, or
sitting
on a rustic bench in one of the leafy
arbors
.
He always wears that same dress, too;
at least, I have never seen him in any other;
a bell-crowned hat,a frilled bosom, and
white dimity vest, soiled with snuff,light
nankeen
smalls,and, over all, that long and
flowing
surtout of russet-brown circassian, hanging
in wrinkles round his slender body, and toying
with his thin rakish legs. Such is his constant
garb, morning and evening; and it gives him a
cool and breezy look even in the heat of a
noon-day in August.
The personage, sketched in the preceding
paragraph, is Monsieur D'Argentville, a
sexagenarian
,
with whom I became acquainted
during my residence at the
Maison de Sant
of Auteuil. I found him there, and left him
there. No body knew when he came,he had
been there from time immemorial; nor when he
was going away,for he himself did not know;
nor what ailed him,for though he was
always complaining, yet he grew neither
better
nor worse, never consulted the physician,
and ate voraciously three times a day. At
table
he was rather peevish, troubled his
neighbors
with his elbows, and uttered the
monosyllable
pish!
rather oftener than good-breeding
and a due deference to the opinions of others
seemed to justify. As soon as he seated
himself
at table he breathed into his tumbler, and
wiped it out with a napkin; then wiped his
plate, his spoon, his knife and fork, in
succession
,
and each with great care. After this he
placed the napkin under his chin, by way of
bib and tucker, and, these preparations being
completed, gave full swing to an appetite,
which was not inappropriately denominated,
by one of our guests,
une faim canine
.
The old gentleman's weak side was an
affectation
of youth and gallantry. Though
written down old, with all the characters of
age, yet at times he seemed to think himself
in the hey-day of life; and the assiduous court
he paid to a fair Countess, who was passing
the summer at the
Maison de Sant,
was the
source of no little merriment to all but himself.
He loved, too, to recall the golden age of his
amours; and would discourse with prolix
eloquence
,
and a faint twinkle in his watery eye,
of his
bonnes fortunes
in times of old, and the
rigors, that many a fair dame had suffered on
his account. Indeed, his chief pride seemed to
be to make his hearers believe, that he had
been a dangerous man in his youth, and was
not yet quite safe.
As I also was a peripatetic of the garden,
we encountered each other at every turn. At
first our conversation was limited to the usual
salutations of the day; but ere long our casual
acquaintance ripened into a kind of intimacy.
Step by step I won my way,first into his
society
,then
into his snuff-box,and then into
his heart. He was a great talker, and he found
in me, what he found in no other inmate of the
house,a good listener, who never interrupted
his long stories, nor contradicted his opinions.
So he talked down one alley and up another,
from breakfast till dinner,from dinner till
midnight;at all times and in all places, when
he could catch me by the button, till at last he
had confided to my ear all the important and
unimportant events of a life of sixty years.
Monsieur D'Argentville was a shoot from
a wealthy family of Nantes. Just before the
Revolution he went up to Paris to study law at
the University; and like many other wealthy
scholars of his age, was soon involved in the
intrigues and dissipation of the metropolis. He
first established himself in the Rue de
l'Universit
;
but a roguish pair of eyes, at an
opposite
window, soon drove from the field such
heavy tacticians as Hugues Doneau and Gui
Coquille. A flirtation was commenced in due
form; and a flag of truce, offering to capitulate,
was sent in the shape of a billet-doux. In the
mean time he regularly amused his leisure
hours by blowing kisses across the street with
an old pair of bellows. One afternoon, as he
was occupied in this way, a tall gentleman
with whiskers stepped into the room, just as he
had charged the bellows to the muzzle. He
muttered something about an explanationhis
sistermarriageand the satisfaction of a
gentleman
!
Perhaps there is no situation in life so
awkward to a man of real sensibility, as that
of being awed into matrimony or a duel by the
whiskers of a tall brother. There was but one
alternative; and the next morning a placard at
the window of the Bachelor of Love, with the
words Furnished Appartment to let, showed
that the former occupant had found it
convenient
to change lodgings.
He next appeared in the Chausse-d'Antin,
where he assiduously prepared himself for
future
exigencies, by a course of daily lessons in
the use of the small-sword. He soon after
quarrelled with his best friend, about a little
actress on the Boulevard, and had the
satisfaction
of being jilted, and then run through the
body at the Bois de Boulogne. This gave him
new eclat in the fashionable world; and
consequently
he pursued pleasure with a keener
relish than ever. He next had the
grande
passion
,
and narrowly escaped marrying an
heiress
of great expectations, and a countless
number
of chateaux. Just before the catastrophe,
however, he had the good fortune to discover,
that the lady's expectations were limited to his
own pocket, and that as for her chateaux, they
were all
Chateaux en Espagne
.
About this time his father died; and the
hopeful son was hardly well established in his
11
inheritance, when the Revolution broke out.
Unfortunately he was a firm upholder of the
divine right of kings, and had the honor of
being
among the first of the proscribed. He
narrowly
escaped the guillotine by jumping on
board a vessel bound for America, and arrived
at Boston with only a few francs in his pocket;
but as he knew how to accommodate himself
to circumstances, he continued to live along
by teaching fencing and French, and keeping
a dancing-school and a milliner.
At the restoration of the Bourbons he
returned
to France; and from that time to the
day of our acquaintance had been engaged in
a series of vexatious law-suits, in the hope of
recovering a portion of his property, which had
been entrusted to a friend for safe keeping, at
the commencement of the Revolution. His
friend, however, denied all knowledge of the
transaction, and the assignment was very
difficult
to prove. Twelve years of unsuccessful
litigation had completely soured the old
gentleman's
temper, and made him peevish and
misanthropic; and he had come to Auteuil,
merely to escape the noise of the city, and to
brace his shattered nerves with pure air and
quiet amusements. There he idled the time
away, sauntering about the garden of the
Maison
de Sant,
talking to himself, when he could
get no other listener, and occasionally
reinforcing
his misanthropy with a dose of the
Maxims
of La Rochefoucauld, or a visit to the
scene of his duel in the Bois de Bologne.
Poor Monsieur D'Argentville! What a
miserable life he ledor rather dragged on
from day to day!A petulant, broken-down
old man, who had outlived his fortune, and his
friends, and his hopes,yea, every thing but
the sting of bad passions, and the recollection
of a life ill-spent!Whether he still walks the
earth, or slumbers in its bosom, I know not;
but a lively recollection of him will always
mingle with my reminiscences of Auteuil.
PRE LA CHAISE.
Death levels all things in his march;
Nought can resist his mighty strength;
The palace proud,triumphal arch,
Shall mete their shadow's length.
The rich, the poor, one common bed
Shall find in the unhonoured grave,
Where weeds shall crown alike the head
Of tyrant and of slave.
Marvel
.
PRE LA CHAISE.
Our fathers find their graves in our short memories, and sadly tell us
how we may be buried in our survivors.
Oblivion is not to be hired. The greater part must be content to be
as though they had not been, to be found in the register of God, not in
the record of man.
Sir Thomas Brown's Urn-Burial
.
The
cemetery of Pre La Chaise is the
Westminster Abbey of Paris. Both are the
dwellings of the dead; but in one they repose
in green alleys and beneath the open sky;in
the other their resting place is in the
shadowy
aisle and beneath the dim arches of an
ancient abbey. One is a temple of nature
the other a temple of art. In one the soft
melancholy
of the scene is rendered still more
touching by the warble of birds and the shade
of trees, and the grave receives the gentle visit
of the sunshine and the shower;in the other
no sound but the passing foot-fall breaks the
silence of the place; the twilight steals in
through high and dusky windows; and the
damps of the gloomy vault lie heavy on the
heart, and leave their stain upon the
mouldering
tracery of the tomb.
Pre La Chaise stands just beyond the
Barrire d' Aulney,
on a hill side, looking
towards
the city. Numerous gravel walks,
winding through shady avenues and between
marble monuments, lead up from the principal
entrance to a chapel on the summit. There is
hardly a grave that has not its little enclosure
planted with shrubbery; and a thick mass of
foliage half conceals each funeral stone. The
sighing of the wind, as the branches rise and
fall upon it,the occasional note of a bird
among the trees, and the shifting of light and
shade upon the tombs beneath, have a soothing
effect upon the mind; and I doubt whether any
one can enter that enclosure, where repose the
dust and ashes of so many great and good men,
without feeling the religion of the place steal
over him, and seeing something of the dark and
gloomy expression pass off from the stern
countenance
of death.
It was near the close of a bright summer
afternoon, that I visited this celebrated spot for
the first time. The first object, that arrested
my attention on entering, was a monument in
the form of a small gothic chapel, which stands
near the entrance, in the avenue leading to the
right hand. On the marble couch within are
stretched two figures carved in stone, and
dressed in the antique garb of the Middle Ages.
It is the tomb of Ablard and Hlose. The
history of these unfortunate lovers is too well
known to need recapitulation; but perhaps it
is not so well known how often their ashes
were disturbed in the slumber of the grave.
Ablard died in the monastery of Saint-Marcel,
and was buried in the vaults of the church.
His body was afterwards removed to the
convent
of the Paraclet, at the request of Hlose,
and at her death her body was deposited in the
same tomb. Three centuries they reposed
together
;
after which they were separated to
different sides of the church to calm the
delicate
scruples of the lady Abbess of the convent.
More than a century afterwards, they were
again united in the same tomb; and when at
length the Paraclet was destroyed, their
mouldering
remains were transported to the church
of Nogent-sur-Seine. They were next
deposited
in an ancient cloister at Paris; and
now repose near the gate-way of the
cemetery
of Pre La Chaise. What a singular
destiny
was theirs!that after a life of such
passionate
and disastrous lovesuch sorrows, and
tears, and penitencetheir very dust should
not be suffered to rest quietly in the grave!
that their death should so much resemble their
life in its changes and vicissitudesits partings
and its meetings,its inquietudes and its
persecutions
!
that mistaken zeal should follow
them down to the very tomb,as if earthly
passion could glimmer, like a funeral lamp,
amid the damps of the charnel-house, and even
in their ashes burn their wonted fires!
As I gazed on the sculptured forms before
me, and the little chapel, whose gothic roof
seemed to protect their marble sleep, my busy
memory swung back the dark portals of the
past, and the picture of their sad and eventful
lives came up before me in the gloomy
distance
.
What a lesson for those who are
endowed
12
with the fatal gift of genius!It would
seem, indeed, that he who tempers the wind
to the shorn lamb, tempers also his
chastisements
to the errors and infirmities of a weak
and simple mind,while the transgressions of
him upon whose nature are more strongly
marked the intellectual attributes of the deity,
are followed, even upon earth, by severer tokens
of the divine displeasure. He who sins in the
darkness of a benighted intellect, sees not so
clearly, through the shadows that surround
him, the countenance of an offended God;
but he who sins in the broad noon-day of a
clear and radiant mind, when at length the
delirium
of sensual passion has subsided, and the
cloud flits away from before the sun, trembles
beneath the searching eye of that accusing
power, which is strong in the strength of a
godlike intellect. Thus the mind and the heart
are closely linked together, and the errors of
genius bear with them their own chastisement,
even upon earth. The history of Ablard and
Hlose is an illustration of this truth. But at
length they sleep well. Their lives are like a
tale that is told; their errors are folded up
like a book; and what mortal hand shall
break the seal that death has set upon them!
Leaving this interesting tomb behind me, I
took a path-way to the left which conducted
me up the hill-side. I soon found myself in
the deep shade of heavy foliage, where the
branches of the yew and willow mingled,
interwoven
with the tendrils and blossoms of the
honey-suckle. I now stood in the most
populous
part of this city of tombs. Every step
awakened a new train of thrilling recollections;
for at every step my eye caught the name of
some one, whose glory had exalted the
character
of his native land, and resounded across
the waters of the Atlantic. Philosophers,
historians
,
musicians, warriors, and poets slept
side by side around me; some beneath the
gorgeous monument, and some beneath the
simple head-stone. There were the graves of
Fourcroi and Hay;of Ginguen and
Volney
;of
Grtry and Mhul;of Ney, and
Foy, and Massna;of La Fontaine, and
Moli
re,
and Chnier, and Delille, and Parny.
But the political intrigue, the dream of science,
the historical research, the ravishing
harmony
of sound, the tried courage, the
inspiration
of the lyre,where are they? With the
living, and not with the dead! The right hand
has lost its cunning in the grave; but the soul,
whose high volitions it obeyed, still lives to
reproduce
itself in ages yet to come.
Among these graves of genius, I observed
here and there a splendid monument, which
had been raised by the pride of family, over
the dust of men, who could lay no claim either
to the gratitude or remembrance of posterity.
Their presence seemed like an intrusion into
the sanctuary of genius. What had wealth to
do there? Why should it crowd the dust of
the great! That was no thoroughfare of
business
no
mart of gain! There were no costly
banquets there; no silken garments, nor gaudy
liveries, nor obsequious attendants! What
servants, says Jeremy Taylor, shall we
have to wait upon us in the grave? What
friends to visit us? What officious people to
cleanse away the moist and unwholesome cloud
reflected upon our faces from the sides of the
weeping vaults, which are the longest weepers
for our funerals? Material wealth gives a
factitious superiority to the living, but the
treasures
of intellect give a real superiority to
the dead; and the rich man, who would not
deign to walk the street with the starving and
penniless man of genius, deems it an honor,
when death has redeemed the fame of the
neglected
,
to have his own ashes laid beside him,
and to claim with him the silent
companionship
of the grave.
I continued my walk through the numerous
winding paths, as chance or curiosity directed
me. Now I was lost in a little green hollow,
overhung with thick-leaved shrubbery, and
then came out upon an elevation, from which,
through an opening in the trees, the eye caught
glimpses of the city, and the little esplanade at
the foot of the hill, where the poor lie buried.
There poverty hires its grave, and takes but a
short lease of the narrow house. At the end
of a few months, or at most of a few years, the
tenant is dislodged to give place to another, and
he in turn to a third. Who, says Sir
Thomas
Browne, knows the fate of his bones, or
how often he is to be buried? who hath the
oracle of his ashes, or whither they are to be
scattered?
Yet, even in that neglected corner, the
hand of affection had been busy in
decorating
the hired house. Most of the graves were
surrounded with a slight wooden paling, to
secure
them from the passing footstep;there
was hardly one so deserted as not to be
marked
with its little wooden cross, and decorated
with a garland of flowers; and here and there
I could perceive a solitary mourner, clothed in
black, stooping to plant a shrub on the grave,
or sitting in motionless sorrow beside it.
As I passed on amid the shadowy avenues
of the cemetery, I could not help comparing
my own impressions, with those which others
have felt when walking alone among the
dwellings
of the dead. Are, then, the sculptured
urn and storied monument nothing more than
symbols of family pride? Is all I see around
me a memorial of the living more than of the
dead?an empty show of sorrow, which thus
vaunts itself in mournful pageant and funeral
parade? Is it indeed true, as some have said,
that the simple wild-flower, which springs
spontaneously upon the grave, and the rose,
which the hand of affection plants there, are
fitter objects wherewith to adorn the narrow
house? No!I feel that it is not so! Let the
good and the great be honored even in the
grave. Let the sculptured marble direct our
footsteps to the scene of their long sleep; let
the chiselled epitaph repeat their names, and
tell us where repose the nobly good and wise!
It is not true that all are equal in the grave.
There is no equality even there. The mere
handful of dust and ashesthe mere
distinction
of prince and beggarof a rich
winding-sheet
and a shroudless burialof a solitary
grave and a family vaultwere this allthen
indeed it would be true that death is a common
leveller. Such paltry distinctions as those
of wealth and poverty are soon levelled by the
spade and mattoc; the damp breath of the
grave blots them out forever. But there are
other distinctions which even the mace of death
cannot level or obliterate. Can it break down
the distinction of virtue and vice? Can it
confound
the good with the bad? the noble with
the base? all that is truly great, and pure and
godlike, with all that is scorned, and sinful, and
degraded! No! Then death is not a common
leveller! Are all alike beloved in death and
honored in their burial? Is that ground holy
where the bloody hand of the murderer sleeps
from crime? Does every grave awaken the
same emotions in our hearts? and do the
foot-steps
of the stranger pause as long beside each
funeral stone? No! Then all are not equal
in the grave! And as long as the good and evil
deeds of men live after them, so long will there
be distinctions even in the grave. The
superiority
of one over another is in the nobler and
better emotions which it excites; in its more
fervent admonitions to virtue; in the livelier
recollection, which it awakens, of the good and
the great, whose bodies are crumbling to dust
beneath our feet!
If, then, there are distinctions in the grave,
surely it is not unwise to designate them by
the external marks of honor. These outward
appliances and memorials of respect,the
mournful urn,the sculptured bust,the
epitaph
eloquent in praise,cannot indeed create
these distinctions, but they serve to mark them.
It is only when pride or wealth builds them to
honor the slave of mammon, or the slave of
appetite
,
when the voice from the grave rebukes
the false and pompous epitaph, and the dust and
ashes of the tomb seem struggling to maintain
the superiority of mere worldly rank, and to
carry into the grave the baubles of earthly
vanity
,it
is then, and then only, that we feel
how utterly worthless are all the devices of
sculpture, and the empty pomp of monumental
brass!
After rambling leisurely about for some
time, reading the inscriptions on the
various
monuments, which attracted my curiosity,
and giving way to the different reflections they
suggested, I sat down to rest myself on a
sunken
tombstone. A winding gravel-walk,
overshaded
by an avenue of trees, and lined on both
sides with richly sculptured monuments, had
gradually conducted me to the summit of the
hill, upon whose slope the cemetery stands.
Beneath me in the distance, and
dim-discovered
through the misty and smoky atmosphere of
evening, rose the countless roofs and spires
of the city. Beyond, throwing his level rays
athwart the dusky landscape, sank the broad
red sun. The distant murmur of the city rose
13
upon my ear; and the toll of the evening bell
came up, mingled with the rattle of the paved
street and the confused sounds of labor. What
an hour for meditation! What a contrast
between
the metropolis of the living and the
metropolis
of the dead! I could not help calling
to my mind that allegory of mortality, written
by a hand, which has been many a long year
cold;
Earth goeth upon earth as man upon mould,
Like as earth upon earth never go should,
Earth goeth upon earth as glistening gold,
And yet shall earth unto earth rather than he would.
Lo, earth on earth, consider thou may,
How earth cometh to earth naked alway,
Why shall earth upon earth go stout or gay,
Since earth out of earth shall pass in poor array.

I subjoin this relic of old English verse entire, and in its antiquated
language, for those of my readers, who may have an antiquarian taste.
It is copied from a book, whose title I have forgotten, and of which I
have but a single leaf, containing the poem. In describing the antiquities
of the church of Stratford-upon-Avon, the writer gives the following
account
of a very old painting upon the wall, and of the poem, which served
as its motto. The painting is no longer visible, having been effaced in
repairing the church.
Against the west wall of the nave, on the south side of the arch,
was painted the martyrdom of Thomas-a-Becket, whilst kneeling at the
altar of St. Benedict in Canterbury cathedral; below this was the figure
of an angel, probably St. Michael, supporting a long scroll, upon which
were seven stanzas in old English, being an allegory of mortality;
Erthe oute of erthe ys wondurly wroght
Erth hath gotyn uppon erth a dygnyte of noght
Erth ypon erth hath sett all hys thowht
How erth apon erth may be hey browght
Erth upon erth wold be a kyng
But how that erth gott to erth he thyngkys nothyng
When erth byddys erth hys rentys whom bryng
Then schall erth apon erth have a hard ptyng
Erth apon erth wynnys castellys and towrys
Then seth erth unto erth thys ys all owrys
When erth apon eath hath bylde hys bowrys
Then schall erth for erth suffur many hard schowrys
Erth goth apon erth as man apon mowld
Lyke as erth apon erth never goo schold
Erth goth apon erth as gelsteryng gold
And yet schall erth unto erth rather then he wold
Why that erth loveth erth wondur me thynke
Or why that erth wold for erth other swett or swynke
When erth apon erth ys broght wt.yn the brynke
Then schall erth apon erth have a fowll stynke
Lo erth on erth consedur thow may
How erth comyth to erth nakyd all way
Why schall erth apon erth goo stowte or gay
Seth erth owt of erth schall passe yn poor aray

Beneath were two men, holding a scroll over a body wrapt in a
winding
sheet, and covered with some emblems of mortality; etc.
Before I left the grave-yard, the shades of
evening had fallen, and the objects around me
grown dim and indistinct. As I passed the
gate-way, I turned to take a parting look. I
could distinguish only the chapel on the
summit
of the hill, and here and there a lofty
obelisk
of snow-white marble, rising from the
black and heavy mass of foliage around, and
pointing upward to the gleam of the departed
sun, that still lingered in the sky, and mingled
with the soft star-light of a summer evening.
