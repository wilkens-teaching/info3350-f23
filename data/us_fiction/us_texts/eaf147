Ingleborough Hall
CHAPTER I.
In
one of those sweet glens, half-pastoral,
half-sylvan, which may be found in
hundreds
channelling the steep sides of the
moorland hills, and sending down the
tribute of their pure limestone springs to
the broad rivers which fertilize, no less
than they adorn, the lovely vales of
Western
Yorkshire, there may be seen to this
day the ruins of an old dwelling-house,
sitnate on a spot so picturesque, so wild,
and yet so soft in its romantic features,
that they would well repay the traveller
for a brief halt, who but too often hurries
onward in search of more remote yet
certainly
not greater beauties.
The gorge, within the mouth of which
the venerable pile is seated, opens into
the broader valley of Wharfdale from the
north-eastern side, enjoying the full light
and warmth of the southern sunshine, and
although very narrow at its origin, where
its crystal rivulet springs up from the
lonely
well-head, fringed by a few low shrubs
of birch and alder, expands here at its
month into a pretty amphitheatre or basin
of a few acres' circuit.
A wild and feathery coppice of oak and
birch and hazel, with here and there a
mountain ash showing its bright red
berries
through the rich foliage, clothes all
the lower part of the surrounding slopes;
while, far above, the seamed and shattered
faces of the grey slaty limestone rise up
like artificial walls, their summits crowned
with the fair purple heather, and every
nook and cranny in their sides crowded
with odorous wild flowers. Within the
circuits of these natural limits, sheltering
it from every wind of Heaven except the
gentle south, the turf lies smooth and
even, as if it were a cultured lawn; while
a few rare exotic shrubs, now all run out
of shape and bare and straggling, indicate
yet the time when it was a fair shrubbery,
tended by gentle hands, and visited by
young and lovely beings, now cold in
their untimely sepulchres.
The streamlet, which comes gushing
down the glen, with its clear copious
flow, boiling and murmuring about the
large grey boulders, which everywhere
obstruct its channel, making a thousand
mimic cataracts, and wakening ever a
wild mirthful music, sweeps here quite
close to the foot of the eastern cliff, the
feathery branches of the oakwood dipping
their foliage in its eddies; and then, just
as it issues forth into the open champaign,
wheels round in a half circle completely
isolating the little amphitheatre above
mentioned, except at one point, hard
beneath
the opposite hill-face, where a small
winding horse-track, engrossing the whole
space between the streamlet and the
limestone
rock, gives access to the lone
demesne
.
A small green hillock sloping down
gently to the southward fills the embracing
arms of the bright brook, around the
northern hase of which is scattered a little
grove of the most magnificent and noblest
syeamores that I have ever seen; but on
the other side, which yet retains its
pristine
character of a smooth open lawn,
there are no obstacles to the view over
the wide valley, except three old guarled
thorn-bushes, uncommon from their size
and the dense luxuriance of their matted
greenery.
It was upon the summit of this little
knoll that the old homestead stood, whose
massive ruins of red freestone, all
over-grown
with briers and tall rank grass and
dock leaves, deface the spot which they
adorned of old; and, when it was erect in
all its fair proportions, the scene which it
overlooked and its own natural attractions
rendered it one of the loveliest residences
in all the north of England.
The wide rich gentle valley, all meadow
land or pasture, without one brown
ploughed field to mar its velvet green, the
tall thick hawthorn hedges with their long
lines of hedgerow timber, oak, ash, and
elm, waking above the smooth
enclosures
;
the broad clear tranquil river
flashing
out like a silver mirror through the
green foliage; the scattered farm-houses,
each nestled as it were among its
sheltering
orchards; the village spire shooting
up from the clump of giant elms, which
overshadow the old grave-yard; the steep
long slope on the other side of the vale,
or strath as it would be called in Scotland,
all mapped out to the eye with its green
fences, and wide hanging woods; and far
beyond the rounded summits of the huge
moorland hills, ridge above ridge, purple,
and grand, and massive, but less and less
distinct, as they recede from the eye, and
melt away at last into the far blue
distance
such
was the picture, which its
windows overlooked of old, and which
still laughs as gaily as of yore, in the glad
sunshine, around its mouldering walls
and lonely hearth-stone.
But if it is fair now, and lovely, what
was it, as it showed in the good old days
of King Charles, before the iron hand of
civil war had pressed so heavily on
England
?
The groves of sycamores stood
there, as they stand now in the prime and
luxuriance of their sylvan manhood; for
they are now waxing aged, and
somewhat
grey and stag-horned; and the thorn
bushes sheltered as they do now, whole
choirs of thrushes and blackbirds; but all
the turf, beneath the scattered trees, and
on the sunny slope, was shorn, and rolled,
and watered, that it was smooth and even,
and far softer than the most costly carpet
that ever wooed the step of Persian
beauty.
The Hall was a square building, not
very large, and of the old Elizabethan style,
with two irregular additionswings as
they might be calledof the same
architecture
,
though of a later period; and its
deep-embayed oriel windows, with their
fantastic millions of carved freestone, its
tall quaint chimneys, and its low porch
with overhanging canopy and clustered
columns, rendered it singularly
picturesque
and striking.
The little green within the gorge of the
upper glen, which is so wildly beautiful
in its present situation, left as it is to the
unaided hand of nature, was then a
perfeet
paradise; for an exquisite taste had
superintended its conversion into a sort
of untrained gardenan ove, well used
to note effects, had marked its natural
capabilities
,
and adding artificial beauties,
had never trenched upon the character of
the spot by anything incongruous or
startling.
Rare plants, rich-flowering shrubs, and
scented herbs, were indeed scattered with
a lavish hand about its precincts, but were
so scattered that they seemed the genuine
production of the soil. The Spanish
cistus
had been taught to carpet the wild
crags, in conjunction with the native
thyme and heather; the arbutus and
laurestinus
had been brought from afar, to
vie with the mountain-ash and holly; the
clematis and the sweet scented vine
blended
their tendrils with the rich English
honeysuckle and the luxuriant ivy; rare
lotuses might be seen floating, with their
azure-colored cups, and broad green
leaves, upon the glassy basins, into which
the mountain streamlet had been taught
to expand, among the white wild
water-lilies
,
and the bright yellow clusters of the
marsh marigolds; roses of every hue and
scent, from the dark crimson of Damascus
to the pale blush of soft Provence, grew
side by side with the wild wood-brier
and eglatine; and many a rustic seat of
mossy stone, or roots and unbarked
branches, invited the loitering visitor in
every shadowy angle.
There was no spot, in all the north of
England, whereon the winter frowned so
lightly as on those sheltered precincts
there was no spot whereon spring smiled
so early, and with so bright an aspect
wherein the summer so long lingered,
pouring her gorgeous flowers, rich with
her spicy breath, into the very lap of
autumn
.
It was indeed a sweet spot, and as
happy as it was sweet and beautiful;
before the curse of civil war was poured
upon the groaning land, with its dread
train of foul and fiendish ministers; and
yet it was not war, nor any of its direct
consequences, that turned that happy
home into a ruin and desolation.
It was not warunless the struggles of
the human heartthe conflict of the fierce
and turbulent passionsthe strife of
principles
,
of motives, of desires, within the
secret soul, may be called waras indeed
they might, and that with no figurative
tongue; for they are the hottest, the most
devastating, the most fatal of all that bear
that ominous and cruel appellation.
Such was the aspect then of
Ingleborough
Hall, at the period when it was
perhaps
the most beautiful, and when, as is
but too often the case, its beauties were
on the very point of being brought to a
close for ever. The family which owned
the manorfor the possessions attached
to the old homestead were large, and the
authority arising from them extended
over a large part of Upper Wharfdale, was
one of those old English races, which,
though not noble, in the literal sense
of the word, are yet so ancient, and so
indissolubly
connected with the soil, that
they may justly be comprised among the
aristocracy of the land. The name was
Saxon; and it was generally believed
and probably with truththat the date of
the name and of its connexion with that
estate, was at the least coeval with the
Conquest. To what circumstances it was
owing, that the Hawkwoods, for such was
the time-honored appellation of the race,
had retained possession of their fair
demesne, when all the land was allotted
ont to feudal barons and fat priests, can
never now be ascertained; nor does it
indeed
signify; yet that it was to some
honorable cause, some service rendered,
or some high exploit, may be fairly
presumed
from the fact, that the mitred
potentate
of Bolton Abbey, who levied his
tythes fat and near, throughout those
fertile
valleys, had no claim on the fruits of
Ingleborough. During the ages that had
passed since the advent of the Norman
William, the Hawkwoods had never
lacked male representatives to sustain
the dignity of their race; and gallantly
had they sustained it; for in full many a
lay and legend, aye! and in grave cold
history itself, the name of Hawkwood
might be found side by side with the more
sonorous appellations of the Norman
fendatories
,
the Ardens, and Manleverers,
and Vaspasouns, which fill the chronicles
of border warfare.
At the period of which I write, however,
the family had no male scionthe last
heir male, Ralph Hawkwood, had died
some years before, full of years and of
domestic
honorsa zealous sportsman, a
loyal subject, a kind laudlord, a good
friendhis lot had fallen in quiet times,
and pleasant places; and he lived happily,
and died in the arms of his family, at
peace with all men. His wife, a calm,
placid dame, who had in her young days
been the beauty of the shire, survived
him; and spent her whole time as she
devoted
her whole mind and spirit, in
educating
the two daughters, joint heiresses
of the old manor-house, who were left by
their father's death, two bright-eyed fair
haired prattlers, dependent for protection
on the strong love, but frail support, of
their widowed mother.
CHAPTER II.
Years
passed away, and with their flight
the two fair children were matured into
two sweet and lovely women; yet the
same fleeting suns; which brought to them
complete and perfect youth, were fraught
to others with decay, and all the carking
cares and querulous ailments of old age.
The mother who had watched, with keen
solicitude, over their budding infancy,
over the promise of their lovely childhood,
lived indeed; but lived not to see or
understand
the full accomplishment of that
bright promise. Even before the elder
girl had reached the dawn of
womanhood
,
palsy had shaken the enfeebled
limbs, and its accustomed follower
mental
debilityhad in no small degree
impaired
the intellect of her surviving parent;
but long before her sister had reached her
maturity, the limbs were helplessly
immovable
,
the mind was wholly clouded and
estrauged.
It was not now the wandering and
uncertain
darkness, that flits across the
veiled horizon of the mind alternately
with vivid gleams, flashes of memory and
intellect, brighter, perhaps, than ever
visited the spirit, until its partial
aberration
had jaried its vital principles, it was
that deep and utter torpor, blanker than
sleep, and dullerfor no dreams seem to
mingle with its day-long lethargythat
absolute paralysis of all the faculties of
soul and body, which is so beautifully
painted by the great Roman satirist, as
the
Omni
Membrorum damno major dementia, quo nec
Nomina servorum, nec vultum agnoscit amici
Curn quo prterita cnavit nocte, nec illos
Quos genuit, quos educit
that still, sad, patient, silent suffering,
which sits from day to day in the one
usual chair, unconscious of itself, and
almost
so of all around it; easily pleased
by trifles, which it forgets as soon;
deriving
its sole real and tangible enjoyment
from the doze in the summer sunshine, or
by the sparkling hearth of winter. Such
was the mother nowso utterly, so
hopelessly
dependent on those bright beings,
whose infancy she had nursed so
devotedly
and
well was that devotedness now
compensated; for day and night, winter
and summer, did those sweet girls by
turns watch over the frail querulous
sexagenarian
never
both leaving her at once,
one sleeping while the other watched,
attentive
ever to her ceaseless cravings,
patient
and mild to meet her angry and
uncalled
for lamentations.
You would have thought a seclusion so
entire, from all society of their equals,
must have prevented their acquiring those
usual accomplishments, those necessary
arts, which every English gentlewoman is
presumed to possess, as things of course
that they must have grown up mere
ignorant
,
unpolished country lasses,
without
taste or aspiration beyond the small
routine of their dull daily dutiesthat long
confinement must have broken the higher
and more spiritual parts of their fine
natural mindsthat they must have
become
mere moping household drudges;
and so to think would be so very natural,
that it is by no means easy to conceive
how it was brought to pass, that the very
opposite of this should have been the
result
.
The very opposite it was, however,
for as there were not in the whole West
Riding two girls more beautiful than
Annabel
and Marian Hawkwood, so were
there surely none so highly educated, so
happy in themselves, so eminently
calculated
to render others happy.
Accomplished as musicians, both,
though Annabel especially, excelled in
instrumental music, while her young
sister
was unrivalled in voice and execution
as a songstress; both skilled in painting;
and if not poetesses, in so much as to be
stringers of words and rhymes, certainly
such, and that, too, of no mean order, in
the wider and far higher acceptation of
the word, for their whole souls were
attuned
to the very highest key of
sensibility
;
romantic, not in the weak and
ordinary
meaning of the term, but as admirers
of all things high and pure and noble;
worshippers of the beautiful, whether it
were embodied in the scenery of their
native
glens, in the rock, the stream, the
forest, the sunshine that clothed all of
them in a rich garb of glory, or the dread
storm that veiled them all in gloom and
terroror in the master-pieces of the
schools of painting, and of sculptureor
in the pages of the great, the glorious of
all agesor in the deeds of men, perils
encountered hardily, sufferings constantly
endured, sorrows assuaged by charitable
generosity. Such were they in the strain
and tenor of their minds; gentle,
moreover
,
as the gentlest of created things;
humble to their inferiors, but with a proud
and self-respecting and considerate
humility
;
open and free and frank towards their
equals, but proud, although not wanting
in loyalty and proper reverence for the
great, and almost haughty of demeanor to
their superiors, when they encountered
any such, which was, indeed, of rare and
singular occurrence.
It was a strange thing, indeed, that these
lone girls should have possessed such
characters; so strongly marked, so
powerful
,
and strikingshould have acquired
accomplishments so many, and so various
in their nature. It will appear, perhaps,
even stranger to merely superficial
thinkers
,
that the formation of these powerful
characters had been for the most part
brought about by the very circumstances
which would at first have appeared most
unpropitioustheir solitary habits,
namely
,
and their seclusionalmost absolute
seclusionfrom the gay world of fashion
and of folly! The large and opulent
county in which their patrimony lay, was
indeed then, as now, studded with the
estates
,
the manors, and the parks of the
richest and the noblest of England's
aristocracy
;
yet the deep glens and lofty
moorlands among which Ingleborough
Hall was situated, are even to this day a
lonely and sequestered region; no great
post-road winds through their devious
passes, and although in the close vicinity
of large and populous towns, they are,
even in the nineteenth century, but little
visited, and are occupied by a population
singularly primitive and pastoral in all its
thoughts and feelings. Much more then
in those days when carriages were seen
but rarely beyond the streets of the
metropolis
,
when roads were wild and rugged,
and intercourse between the nearest
places, unless of more than ordinary
magnitude
,
difficult and uncertainwas that
wild district to be deemed secluded. So
much so, indeed, was this the case, that
at the time of which I write there was not
within the circle of some twenty miles, two
families of equal rank, or filling the same
station of society with the Hawkwoods.
This, had the family been in such
circumstances
of domestic health and happiness
as would have permitted the girls to
mingle
in the gaieties of the neighborhood,
would have been a severe and serious
misfortune; as they must, from the
continual
intercourse with their inferiors, have
contracted, in a greater or less degree, a
grossness both of mind and manner; and
would, most probably, have fallen into
that most destructive habitdestructive to
the mind, I mean, and to all chance of
progress or advancementthe love of
queening it in low society. It was,
therefore
,
under their circumstances, including
the loss of one parent, and the entire
bereavement
of the other, fortunate in no
small degree that they were compelled to
seek their pleasures and their occupations,
no less than their duties, within the sphere
of the domestic circle.
The mother, who was now so feeble
and so helpless, though never a person of
much intellectual energy, or indeed of
much force of any kind, was yet in the
highest sense of the word, a
lady
. She
had seen something of the great world
apart from the rural glens which witnessed
her decline; had mingled with the gay and
noble even at the court of England; and
being possessed of more than ordinary
beauty, had been a favorite, and in some
degree, a belle. From her, then, had her
daughters naturally and unconsciously
imbibed that easy, graceful finish, which,
more than all beside, is the true stamp of
gentle birth and bearing. Long before
children can be brought to comprehend
general principles or rules of convention,
they can and do acquire habits, by that
strange tact of observance, which
certainly
commences at a stage so early of their
young frail existence, that we cannot by
any effort mark its first dawninghabits,
which thus acquired can hardly be effaced
at allwhich will endure unaltered, and
invariable, when tastes and practices, and
modes of thought and action, contracted
long, long afterward, have faded quite
away and been forgotten. Thus was it
then, with these young creatures, while
they were yet mere girls, with all the
pure right impulses of childhood bursting
out fresh and fair, they had been trained
up in the midst of high and honorable and
correct associationsnaught low, or mean,
or little; naught selfish, or dishonest, or
corrupt, had ever so much as come near
to them; in the sight of virtue, and in the
practice of politeness, they had shot up
into maturity; and their maturity, of
consequence
,
was virtuous and polished.
In after years, devoted as they were to
that sick mother, they had no chance of
unlearning anything, and thus from day
to day they went on gaining fresh graces,
as it were, by deduction from the foregone
teaching, and from the fact that purity and
nature when united must be graceful
until the proudest courts of Europe could
have shown nothing, even in their most
difficult circles, that could surpass, even
if it could vie with, the easy artless
frankness
,
the soft and finished courtesy, the
unabashed, yet modest grace, of those two
mountain maidens.
At the period when my sad tale
commences
for
it is no less sad than true
the sisters had just reached the young yet
perfect bloom of mature womanhood
the elder, Annabel, having attained her
twentieth summer, her sister Marian,
being
exactly one year younger; and
certainly
two sweeter or more lovely girls
could not be pictured or imaginednot
even in the brightest moments of the
painter's
or poet's inspiration. They were both
tall and beautifully formedboth had sweet
low-toned voicesthat excellent thing in
woman! but here all personal resemblance
ended; for Annabel, the elder, had a
complexion
pure and transparent as the snow
of the untrodden glacier before the sun
had kissed it into roseate blushes, and
quite as colorlessher features were of the
finest classic outline, the smooth fair brow,
the perfect Grecian nose, the short curve
of the upper lip, the exquisite arch of the
small mouth, the chiselled lines of the
soft rounded chin, might have served for a
model to a seniptor, whereby to mould a
mountain nymph or Naiad. Her rich
luxuriant
hair was of a light and sunny brown,
her eyes of a clear lustrous blue with a
soft languid and half melancholy
tenderness
,
for their more usual expression;
which suited well with the calm placid air
that was almost habitual to her beautiful
features. To this no contrast more
complete
could have been offered, than by the
widely different style of Marian's
loveliness
.
Though younger than her sister,
her figure was more full and roundedso
much so, that it reached the very point
where symmetry is combined with
voluptnousness
;
yet was there nothing in the
least degree voluptuous or sensual in the
expression of her bright artless face. Her
forehead, higher than Annabel's and
broader
,
was as smooth and as white as
polished
marble; her brows were well defined
and black as ebony; as were the long,
long lashes that fringed her laughing eyes
eyes of the brightest, lightest azure, that
ever glanced with merriment or melted into
loveher nose was small and delicate, but
turned a little upward, so as to add,
however
,
rather than detract from the
tout
ensemble
of her arch, roguish beauty; her
mouth was not very small, but
exquisitely
formed, with lips redder than
anything
in nature, to which lips can be
well compared; and filled with teeth
regular
,
white, and beautifully even. Fair as
her sister's, and like hers, showing
everywhere
the tiny veins of azure meandering
below the milky skin, Marian's
complexion
was yet as bright as morning, with
faint rosy tints, and red warm blushes,
succeeding one another, or vanishing
away, and leaving the cheek pearly white,
as one emotion followed and effaced
another
in her pure innocent mind.
Her hair, profuse in its luxuriant flow,
was of a deep, dark brown, that might
almost
have been called blackbut for a
thousand glancing golden lights, and warm
rich shadows, that varied its smooth
surface
with the varying sunshineand was
worn in a thick, massive plait, low down
in the neck behind, while on either side
the brow it was trained off and taught to
cluster in front of either tiny ear, in an
abundant maze of interwoven curls, close
and mysteriously eulaced, as are the
tendrils
of the wild vine, which fluttering on
each warm and blushing cheek, fell down
the swan-like neck in heavy natural
ringlets
.
But to describe the features is to give no
idea, in the least, of Marian's real beauty
there was a radiant, dazzling lustre,
that leaped out of her every feature,
lightening
from her quick speaking eyes, and
playing in the dimples of her bewitching
smile, that so intoxicated the beholder,
that he would dwell upon her face
entranced
;
and know that it was lovely; and
feel that it was far more lovely, far more
enthralling, than any he had ever looked
upon before, yet, when without the sphere
of that enchantment, he would be all
unable
to say wherein consisted its unmatched
attraction.
Between the natural disposition and
temperaments of the two sisters, there
was, perhaps, even a wider difference
than between the characteristics of their
personal beauty, for Anuabel was calm
and mild, and singularly placid; not in
her manners only, but in the whole tenor
of her thoughts, and words, and actions
there was a sort of gentle melancholy,
that was not altogether melancholy either,
pervading her every tone of voice, her
every change of feature. She was not
exactly
grave, or pensive, or subdued; for
she could smile very joyously at times,
could act upon emergencies with
readiness
,
and quickness, and decision; and was
at all times prompt in the expression of
her confirmed sentiments. But there was
a very remarkable tranquillity in her mode
of doing everything she did; betokening
fully the presence of a decided principle,
directing her at every step, so that she
was rarely agitated, even by accidents of
the most sudden and alarming character,
and never actuated by any rapid impulse.
The very opposite to this was Marian
Hawkwood; for although quite as
upright
and pure-minded as her sister
and what is more, of a temper quite as
amiable and sweet, yet was her mood as
changeful as an April day; although it
was more used to mirth and joyous
laughter
than to frowns or tears either, yet
had she tears as ready at any tale of
sorrow
,
as are the fountains of the
spring-shower
in the cloud, and eloquent frowns
and eyes, that lightened their quick
indignation
.
At any outrage, or oppression, or
high-handed deed, her cheek would
crimson
with the tell-tale blood, her flesh
would seem to thrill upon her bones, her
voice would choke, and her eyes swim
with sympathetic drops, whenever she
read, or spoke, or heard of any noble
deed, whether of gallant daring, or of
heroic
self-denial. Her tongue was prompt
always as the sword of the knight-errant
to shelter the defenceless, to shield the
innocent, to right the wrouged, and
sometimes
to avenge the absent. Artless
herself
,
and innocent in every thought and
feeling, she set no guard on either, but as
she felt and thought, so she spoke out and
acted, fearless, even as she was
unconscious
of any wrong; defying
misconstruction
,
and half inclined to doubt the
possibility of evil in the minds of others;
so foreign did it seem, and so impossible
to her own natural, and, as it were,
instinctive
sense of right.
Yet although such, in all respects, as I
have striven to depict them, the one all
quick and flashing impulse, the other all
reflective and considerate principle, it
was most wonderful how seldom there
was any clashing of opinion, or diversity
of judgment, as to what was to be done,
what left undone, between the lovely
sisters
.
Marian would, it is true, often jump
at once to conclusions, and act as rapidly
upon them too, at which the more
reflective
Annabel would arrive only after
some consideration; but it did not occur
more often than the one had reason to
repent
of her precipitation, than the other
of her over-caution. Neither, indeed, had
much cause for remorse of this kind at all;
for all the impulses of the one, all the
thoughts and principles of the other, were
alike pure and kindly. With words,
however
,
it was not quite the same; for it
must be admitted, that Marian oftentimes
said things, how unfrequently soever she
did aught, which she would
willingly
have recalled afterwards. Not, indeed,
that she ever said anything unkind, or
wrong in itself, and rarely anything that
could give pain to another, unless that
pain were richly merited, indeed; but that
she gradually came to learnlong before
she learned to restrain her impulsesthat
it may be very often unwise to speak,
what in itself is wiseand very often, if
not wrong, yet certainly imprudent, and
of evil consequence, to give loud utterance
even to right opinions.
CHAPTER III.
Such
were the persons, such the
dispositions
of the fair heiresses of Ingleborough
at the time when they had attained the
ages I have specified; and certainly,
although
their spheres of usefulness would
have appeared, at first sight, circumscribed,
and the range of their enjoyments very
narrow, there rarely have been seen two
happier or more useful beings than
Annabel
and Marian Hawkwood, in this wide
world of sin and sorrow.
The care of their bereaved and hapless
parent occupied, it is true, the greater
portion
of their time; yet they found many
leisure hours to devote to visiting the
poor, aiding the wants of the needy,
consoling
the sorrows of those who mourned,
and sympathizing with the pleasures of
the happy, among their humble
neighbors
.
To them this might be truly termed
a work of love and pleasure; for it is
questionable whether from any other
source the lovely girls derived a higher or
more satisfactory enjoyment, than from
their tours of charity among their village
pensioners.
Next in the scale of happiness stood,
doubtless, the society of the old vicar of
that pastoral parish; a man who had been
their father's friend and counsellor in those
young days of college friendship, when
the fresh heart is uppermost in all, and
selfishness a dormant passion; a man old
enough almost to have been their
grandsire
,
but with a heart as young and as
cheery as a boy'san intellect
accomplished
in the deepest lore of the schools,
both classical and scientific, and skilled
thoroughly in all the niceties and graces
of French, and Spanish, and Italian
literature
a
man who had known courts and
camps, too, for a short space in his youth;
who had seen much and suffered much,
and yet enjoyed, not a little, in his
acquaintance
with the world; and who,
from sights, and sufferings, and
enjoyments
,
had learned that if there is much
evil, there is yet more of good, even in
this
worldhad learned, while rigid to his
own faults, to be most lenient to his
neighbor's
failingshad learned that charity
should be the fruit of wisdom!and had
learned all this only to practise it in all
his daily walks, to inculcate it in all his
weekly lessons.
This aged man, and his scarce less aged
wife, living hardly a stone's throw from
the Hall, had grown almost to think
themselves
a portion of the family; and surely
no blood kindred could have created
stronger ties of kindness than had the
familiarity of long acquaintance, the
confidence
of old hereditary love. Lower yet
in the round of their enjoyments, but still
a constant source of blameless satisfaction,
were their books, their music, and their
drawings; the management of their
household
,
the cultivation of their lovely garden,
the ministering to the wants of their loved
birds and flowers. Thus, all sequestered
and seclnded from the world, placed in
the midst of onerous duties, and solicitudes
almost innumerable, though they had
never danced at a ball, nor blushed at the
praise of their own beauty flowing from
eloquent lips, nor listened to a lover's suit,
queens might have envied the felicity, the
calm pure peaceful happiness of Annabel
and Marian.
They were, indeed,
too
happy! I do
not mean too happy to be virtuous, too
happy to be mindful of and grateful to the
Giver of all joybut, as the common
phrase runs, too happy for their happiness
to be enduring. This is a strange belief
a wondrous superstition!and yet it
has been common to all ages. The Greeks,
those wild poetical dreamers, imagined
that their vain gods, made up of moral
attributes
,
envied
the bliss of men, fearing
that wretched earthlings should vie in
happiness with the possessors of Olympus.
They sang in their dark mystic choruses,
That perfect bliss of men not childless dies,
But, ended, leaves a progeny behind,
Of woes, that spring from fairest fortune
blind
and, though their other doctrines of that
insuperable destinythat absolute
necessity
,
to resist which is needless laborand
of ancestral guilt, through countless
generations
,
would seem to militate against
it, there was no more established faith,
and no more prevalent opinion, than that
unwonted fortunes were necessarily
followed
by most unusual woe. Hence,
perhaps
,
the stern self-mortification of the
middle ageshence, certainly, the vulgar
terror prevalent more or less among all
classes, and in every time and country,
that children are too beautiful, too
prematurely
clever, too good to be long-lived
that happiness is too great to be lasting
that mornings are too fine to augur
stormless
days!
And weaye! we ourselveswe of a
better
faith, and purer dispensationwe half
believe all this, and more than half
tremble
at it, although, in truth, there is no
cause for fear in the beliefsince, if there
be aught of truth in the mysterious creed,
which facts do in a certain sense seem to
bear out, we can but think, we cannot but
perceive, that this is but a varied form of
care and misery, vouchsafed by the Great
All-perfect toward his frail creaturesthat
this is but a merciful provision, to hinder
us from laying up for ourselves treasures
upon earth, where moth and rust do
corrupt
,
and where thieves break through and
steala provision to restrain us from
forgetting, in the small temporary bliss of
the present, the boundless and
incomparable
beatitude of the futureto warn us
against hartering, like Esau, our birthright
for a mess of portage!
But I am now called to follow out this
train of thought, suggested by the change
in the fortunes of those to whom I am
performing the part of historian; by the
change, I say, in their fortunesa change,
too, arising from the very circumstances,
as is frequently the case, which seemed to
promise the most fairly for their
improvement
and their permanence. Oh! how
blind guides are we! even the most
farsighted
of us all!how weak and
senseless
judges, even the most sagacious!
how false and erring prophets, even the
wisest and the best!
It was, as I have said already,
somewhere
late in the summer, wherefrom
Annabel reckoned her twentieth and
Marian
her nineteenth yearvery late in the
last month of summer, an hour or two
before
the sunset of as beautiful an evening
as ever smiled upon the face of the green
earth. The sky was nearly cloudless,
though a thin gauze-like haze had floated
up from the horizon, and so far veiled the
orb of the great sun, that the eye could
gaze undazzled on his glories; and the
whole air was full of a rich golden light,
which flooded the level meadows with its
lustre, except where they were
checkered
by the long cool blue shadows
projected
from the massive clumps of noble
forest trees, which, singly or in groups,
diversified the lonely vale, and gilded the
tall slender steeple of the old village
church, and glanced in living fire from the
broad oriel windows of the Hall.
Such was the evening, and so beautiful
the prospect, with every sound and sight
in perfect harmonythe sharp squeak of
the rapid swifts, wheeling their airy
circles
around the distant spire, the full and
liquid melodies of thrush and blackbird
from out the thorn bushes upon the lawn,
the lowing of the cows, returning from
their pasture to pay the evening tribute,
the very cawing of the homeward rooks,
blended by distance into a continuous and
soothing murmur, the rippling music of
the stream, the low sound of the west
wind in the foliage of the sycamores, the
far shout of the children, happy at their
release from school, the carol of a solitary
milk-maid, combining to make up a music
as sweet as can be heard or dreamed of
by the sleeping poet. That lovely picture
was surveyed, and that delicious melody
was listened to, by eyes and ears well
fitted to appreciate their loveliness, for at
an open casement of a great parlor in the
Hall, with furniture all covered with those
elegant appliances of female industry
well executed drawings, and books, and
instruments of music, and work-baskets,
and frames for embroiderywhich show
so pleasantly that the apartment is one
not of show, but of calm home-enjoyment
at an open casement sat Annabel, alone
for the presence of the frail paralytic
being, who dozed in her arm-chair, at the
further end of the room, cannot be held to
constitute society. Marian, for the first
time in her life, was absent from her home,
on a visit, which had already endured
nearly six weeks, to the only near relative
of the family who was yet livinga
younger
sister of her motherwho had married
many years ago a clergyman, whose piety
and talents had raised him to a stall in the
Cathedral Church of York, where he
resided
with his wifea childless couple.
This worthy pair had passed a portion
of the summer at the Hall, and when
returning
to the metropolis of the county
had prevailed on their younger niece, not
altogether without difficulty, to go with
them for a few weeks, and see a little
society
on a scale something more extended
than that which her native vales could
offer. It was the first time in their lives
that the sisters had been parted for more
than a few days, and now the hours were
beginning to appear very long to Annabel;
as weeks were running into months, and
the gorgeous suns of summer were fast
preparing to give place to the cold dews
and frosty winds of autumn. The evening
meal was over, and a solitary thing was
that meal now, which used to be the most
delightful of the day; and hastily did the
lonely sister hurry it over, thinking all the
while what might be Marian's occupation
at the moment, and whether she too was
engaged in thoughts concerning her far
friends, and the fair home of her
childhood
.
It was then, in a mood half melancholy
and half listless, that Annabel was gazing
from her window, down the broad valley
to the eastward, marvelling at the beauty
of the scenery, though she had noted
every changing hue that flitted over the
far purple hills a thousand times before;
and listening to every sweet familiar
sound; and yet, at the same time,
pondering
,
as if she were quite unconscious
of all that met her senses, about things
which she fancied might be happening at
York, when on a sudden, her attention
was aroused by a dense cloud of dust,
rising beyond the river, upon the line of
the high road, and sweeping up the valley,
with a progress so unusually rapid as to
indicate that the objects, which it veiled
from view, must be in more than
commonly
quick motion. For a few moments
she watched this little marvel narrowly,
but without any apprehension or even
any solicitude; until, as it drew nearer,
she could at times see bright flashes, as if
of polished metal, gleaming out through
the murky wreaths, and feathers waving
in the air.
The year was that, in which the hapless
Charles, all hopes of reconciliation with
his parliament being decidedly frustrated,
displayed the banner of civil war, and
drew the sword against his subjects. The
rumors of the coming strife had circulated,
like the dread subterraneous rumblings
which harbinger the earthquake, through
all the country far and near; sad omens
of approaching evil! and more distinctly
were they bruited through Yorkshire, in
consequence of the attempt which had
been made by the royal party to secure
Hull, with all its magazines and shipping
frustrated by the energy and spirit of the
Hothamsso that, as soon as she
perceived
that the dust was beyond all doubt
stirred up by a small party of
well-appointed
horse, Annabel entertained no
doubts as to the meaning, but many
serious
apprehensions as to the cause of the
present visitation.
CHAPTER IV.
The
road, by which the cavaliers were
proceeding, through well-made and
passable
at all times, was no considerable
thoroughfare; no large or important towns
lay on its route; nay, no large villages
were situated on its margin. It was a
devious
winding way, leading to many a
homely farm-house, many a sequestered
hamlet, and affording to the good rustics a
means of carrying their wheat and eggs
and butter, or driving their fat cattle and
black-face moorland sheep to market; but
it was not the direct line between any two
points, or places, worthy even of a
passing
notice. It is true, that some twelve or
fifteen miles down the valley there was a
house or two tenanted by gentryone
that might by a liberal courtesy have been
designated a castle; but above
Ingleborough
Hall, to northwestward, there was
no manor-house or dwelling of the
aristocracy
at all, until the road left the
ghylls
as those wild glens are designatedand
joined the line of the great northern
turnpike
.
It was extremely singular then, to say
the least, that a gay troop of riders should
appear suddenly in that wild spot, so far
from anything that would be likely to
attract
them; and Annabel sat some time
longer by the window, wondering, and at
the same time fearing, although in truth
she scarce knew what; until at a mile's
distance she saw them halt, and after a
few moments' conversation with a
farming-man
on the wayside, as if to inquire
their route, turn suddenly down a narrow
by-road leading to the high narrow bridge
of many arches, which crossed the noble
river and gave the only access to the
secluded
site of Ingleborough. When she
saw this, however, her perturbation
became
very great; for well she knew that
there lay nothing in that direction except
one little market-town, far distant, and a
few scattered farm-houses on the verge of
the moors, so that there could be but little
doubt that Ingleborough was indeed their
destination.
The very moment that she arrived at
this conclusion, Annabel called a
serving-man
,
and bade him run quick to the
vicarage
,
and pray good Doctor Summers to
come up to her instantly, as she was in
great strait, and fain would speak with him;
and at the same time, with an energy of
character that hardly could have been
expected
from one so young and delicate,
ordered the men of the household
including
in those days the fowler and
falconer
,
and half a dozen grooms and many
a supernumerary more, whom we in these
degenerate times have long discarded as
incumbrances, to have their arms in
readiness
for
every manor-house then had
its regular armoryand to prepare the
great bell of the Hall, to summon all the
tenants on the instant in case such
proceedings
should be needful.
In a few moments the good grey-haired
vicar came, almost breathless from the
haste with which he had crossed the little
space between the vicarage and the manor
and a little while afterwards his wife
followed
him, anxious to learn as soon as
possible what could have so disturbed the
quiet tenor of a mind so regulated by
high principles, and garrisoned by holy
thoughts, as Annabel's. Their humble
dwelling, though searce a stone's throw
from the Hall, was screened by a
projecting
knoll feathered with dense and
shadowy
coppice, hiding from it entirely the
road by which the horsemen were
advancing
;
so that the worthy couple had
not perceived, or suspected, anything, to
justify the fears of Annabel, until they
were both standing in her presence. Then,
while the worthy doctor was proffering his
assistance, and his good wife inquiring
eagerly what was amiss, they caught sight
of that gay company of cavaliers, with
feathers waving and scarfs fluttering in
the wind, and gold embroideries glancing
to the sun; as, having left the dusty road,
they wheeled through the green meadows
and flashed suddenly upon their eyesa
spectacle as unexpected as it was
gorgeous
and exciting!
Who can they be? What possibly can
bring them hither? exclaimed Annabel,
pointing with evident trepidation towards
the rapidly approaching horsemen. I
fearoh! I greatly fear some heavy ill is
comingbut I have ordered all the men
to take their arms, and the great bell will
bring us twenty tenants in half as many
minutes! What can it be, good doctor?
Indeed I know not, Annabel, replied
the good man, smiling cheerfully as he
spoke; in truth I know not, nor can at
all conjecture; but be quite sure of this,
dear girl, that they will do, to us at least,
no evil!they are King Charles's men,
without doubt, churchmen and cavaliers,
all of them!any one can see that! and,
though I know not that we have much to
fear from either party, from them at least
we have no earthly cause for
apprehension
.
I will go forth, however, to meet
them; and to learn their errand
meantime
,
fear nothing.
Oh! you mistake me, she answered
at once; oh! you mistake me very
much; for I did not even for a moment
fear personally anything; it was for my
poor mother I was first alarmed; and all
our good neighbors; and indeed all the
country around, that shows so beautiful
and happy this fair evening!oh! but
this civil war is a dread thing; and dread
I fear will be the reckoning of those who
make it.
Who make it
without cause
, my
daughter
!
A dreadful thing it is at all times, but
it may be a necessary, aye! and a holy
thingwhen freedom or religion are at
stake! but we will talk of this at another
time; for see, they have already reached
the furthest gate, and I must speak with
them before they enter here, let them be
who they may.
And, with the words, pressing her hand
with fatherly affection, Farewell, he
said, be of good cheer. I purpose to
return
forthwith. And then he left the
room, and hurrying down the steps of the
porch, walked far more rapidly than
seemed to suit his advanced years and
sedentary
habits, across the park to meet
the gallant company.
A gallant company, indeed, it was and
such as was but rarely seen in that wild
regionbeing the train of a young
gentleman
,
of some eight or nine and twenty
years, splendidly mounted, and dressed in
the magnificent fashion of those days, in
a half military costume; for his buff coat
was lined throughout with rich white satin,
and fringed and looped with silver, a
falling
collar of rich Flanders lace flowing
down over his steel gorget, and a broad
scarf of blue silk supporting his long
silver-hilted
rapier. By his side, rode another
person, not certainly a menial servant, and
yet clearly not a gentleman of birth and
lineage; and after these, a dozen or more
armed attendants followed, all wearing
the blue searf and black feathers of the
royalists, all nobly mounted, and accounted,
like regular troopers, with sword and
dagger, pistols and musquetoons, although
they wore no breastplates, nor any sort of
defensive annor.
A brace of jet-black greyhounds,
without
a speck of white upon their sleek and
glistening hides, ran bounding merrily
beside
their master's stirrup, and a
magnificent
goshawk sat hooded on his wrist,
with silver bells and richly decorated
jesses. So much had the ladies observed,
even before the old man reached the party;
but when he did so, and paused for a
moment
to address the leader, that
gentleman
immediately dismounted from his
horse; and after shaking hands, cordially,
the two advanced together, apparently
engaged in eager conversation, toward
the entrance of the hall.
This went far, on the instant, to restore
confidence to Annabel; but when they
came so near that their faces could be
seen distinctly from the windows, and she
could mark a well-pleased smile upon the
venerable features of her friend, she was
completely reassured. A single
glance-moreover
,
at the face of the
stranger-showed
her that the most timid maiden
need hardly feel a moment's apprehension,
even if he were her country's or her
faction's
foe; for it was not merely
handsome
,
striking, and distinguished, but such
as indicates, or is supposed to indicate,
the presence of a kindly disposition and
good heart. Annabel had not much time,
indeed, for making observations at that
time; for it was scarce a minute before
they had ascended the short flight of steps,
which led to the stone porch, and entered
the door of the vestibule. A moment
louger
,
and they came into the parlor, the
worthy vicar leading the young man by
the hand, as if he were a friend of ten
years' standing.
Annabel, he exclaimed, in a joyous
voice, as he crossed the threshold of the
room, this is the young Lord de Vaux,
son of your honored father's warmest and
oldest friends, and in years long gone by
but unforgotten, my kindest patron. He
has come hither, bearing letters from
his
fatherknowing not until now, that you,
my child, were so long since bereaved
letters of commendation, praying the
hospitality
of Ingleborough, and the best
influence
of the name of Hawkwood, to
levy men to serve King Charles, in the
approaching war. I have already told
him
How glad, how welcome, doubtless,
would have been his cominganswered
Annabel, advancing easily to meet the
youthful nobleman, although a deep blush
covered all her pale features, as she
performed
her unaccustomed dutyhad my
dear father been alive, or my poor
mother
casting
a rapid glance towards the
invalidbeen in health to greet him.
As it isshe continued, the Lord de
Vaux, I doubt not in the least, will
pardon
any imperfections in our hospitality,
and believe if in aught we err, it will be
error not of friendliness, or of feeling, but
of experience only; seeing I am but a
young mistress of a household. You, my
kind friend, and Mistress Summers, will
doubtless tarry with us, while my Lord de
Vaux gives us the favor of his presence.
Loath should I be, indeed, dear lady,
thus to intrude upon your sorrows, could
I at all avoid it, replied the cavalier
and charming, as it must needs be, to
enjoy the hospitalities tendered by such
an one as you, I do assure you, were I
myself concerned alone, I would remount
my horse at once, and ride away, rather
than force myself upon your courtesy.
But, when I tell you that my father's
strong opinion holds it a matter of
importance
importance
almost vitalto the
King, and to the cause of Church and
State in England, that I should levy some
force here of cavalierswhere there be so
few heads of noble houses livingto act
in union with Sir Philip Musgrave, in the
north, and with Sir Marmaduke Langdale,
I both trust and believe, that you will
overlook the trouble and intrusion, in fair
consideration of the motives which impel
me.
Pray, said she, smiling gaily, pray,
my Lord de Vaux, let us now leave
apology
and complimentmost unaffectedly
and truly, I am glad to receive you both
as the son of my father's valued friend, and
as a faithful servant of our most gracious
kingwe will do our best to entertain
you; and Doctor Summers will aid you,
with his counsel and experience, in
furthering
your military levies. How left
you the good earl, your father? I have
heard mine speak of him many times,
and ever in the highest terms of praise,
when I was but a little girland my poor
mother much more recently; before this
sad calamity affected her so fearfully.
Her answer, as it was intended, had
the effect of putting an end to all
formality
,
and setting the young nobleman
completely
at ease; the conversation took a
general tone, and was maintained on all
sides with sufficient spirit, untilwhen
Annabel retired for a little space, to
conduct
her mother to her chamberDe
Vaux found himself wondering how a
mere country girl, who had lived a life so
secluded and domestic, should have
acquired
graces, both of mind and manner,
such as he never had discovered in court
ladies; while she was struck, even in a
greater degree, by the frank, unaffected
bearing, the gay wit, and sparkling
anecdote
,
blended with many a touch of
deeper
feeling, which characterized the
youthful
nobleman's conversation.
After a little while she re-appeared;
and, with her, was announced the
evening
meal, the pleasant, old-fashioned
supper
;
and, as he sat beside her, while she
presided, full of calm, modest
self-possession
,
at the head of her hospitable
board, with no one to encourage her, or
lend her countenance, except the good old
vicar and his homely help-mate, he could
not but draw fresh comparisons, all in her
favor, too, betwixt the quiet, graceful
confidence of the ingenuous girl before
him, and the
minauderies
and the
meretricious
airs of the court dames, who had
been hitherto the objects of his passing
admiration
.
Cheerfully, then, and pleasantly the
evening passed away; and when upon
her little couch, hard by the invalid's sick
bed, Annabel thought over the events of
the past day, she felt concerning young
De Vaux, rather as if he had been an old
familiar friend, with whom she had
renewed
an intercourse long interrupted;
than as of a mere acquaintance, whom
that day had first introduced, and whom
the next might possibly remove for ever.
Something there was, when they met
next, at breakfast, on the following
morning
,
of blushing bashfulness in Annabel,
which he had not observed, nor she
before
experienced; but it passed rapidly
away, and left her self-possessed and
tranquil
while
surely in the sparkling eye,
the eager haste, with which he broke
away from his conversation with Dr.
Summers, as she enteredin his hand
half extended, and then half awkwardly,
half timidly withdrawn, there was much
indication of excited feeling, widely at
variance with the polite and even formal
mannerism inculcated and practised in
the court of the unhappy Charles. It
needs not, however, to dwell on passing
conversations, to narrate every trifling
incident
;
the morning meal once finished,
De Vaux mounted his horse, and rode
forth in accordance with the directions of
the loyal elergyman, to visit such among
the neighboring farmers, as were most
likely to be able to assist him in levying a
horse regiment.
A few hours passed; and he returned
full of high spirits and hot confidencehe
had met every here assurances of good
will to the royal cause; had succeeded in
enlisting some ten or more stout and
hardy youths, and had no doubt of
finally accomplishing the object which he
had in view, to the full height of his
aspirations
.
After dinner, which, in those primitive
days, was served at noon, he was
engaged
for a time in making up despatches
for his father, which having been sent
off by one of his own trusty servants to
the castle in Northumberlnd, he went
out, and joined his lovely hostess in the
sheltered garden, which I have described
above; and there they lingered until the
sun was sinking in the west, behind the
huge and purple-headed hills that screened
the horizon in that direction. The
evening
circle and the social meal succeeded;
and when they parted for the night, if
Annabel and young De Vaux could not
be said to be enamored, as indeed they
could not yet, they had at least made so
much progress to that end, that each
esteemed
the other the most agreeable and
charming person, it had been hitherto their
fortune to encounter; andalthough this
was decidedly the furthest point to which
the thoughts of Annabel extendedwhen
he had lain down on his bed, with the
sweet rays of the harvest moon flooding
his room with quiet lustre, and the voice
of the murmuring rivulet, and the low
flutter of the west wind in the giant
sycamores
,
blending themselves into a soft
and soothing melodythe young lord
found himself considering how gracefully
that fair pale girl would fill the place
which had been long left vacant by his
mother in the grand hall of Gilsland
Castle
.
CHAPTER V.
Another
and another day succeededa
week slipped awaya second and a third
followed it; and still the ranks of the
royal regiment, though they were filled
rapidly, had many vacancies, and arms
had yet to be provided, and standards and
musicians; messengers went and came
continually between the castle and the
manor, and all was haste and confusion
in the lone glens of Wharfdale.
Meantime
a change was wrought in Annabel's
demeanor, and all who saw remarked it
there was a brighter glow than ever had
been seen before, in her transparent
cheeks; her eyes sparkled almost as
brilliantly
as Marian's; her lips were
frequently
arrayed in bright and beaming
smiles; her step was light and springy as
a young fawn's on the mountain.
Annabel
was in love, and had discovered that
she was soAnnabel was beloved and
knew itthe young lord's declaration and
the old earl's conseut had come together;
and the sweet maiden's heart was given,
and her hand promised, almost before the
asking. Joy! joy! was there not joy in
Ingleborough?
The good old vicar's tranquil air of
satisfaction
;
the loud and eloquent mirth of
his kind hearted housewifethe merry,
gay congratulations of wild Marian, who
wrote from York, half crazy with
excitement
and delightthe evident and lovely
happiness of the young promised bride
what pen of man may even aspire to
write them. All was decidedall
arranged
the
marriage was, so far, at least, to
be held private, that no festivities or
public
merriment should bruit it to the world,
until the civil strife should be decided, and
the king's power established; which all
men fancied, at that day, it would by a
single battleand which, had Rupert
wheeled upon the flank of Essex at
Edge-Hill
,
instead of chasing the discomfited
and flying horse of the Roundheads,
miles from the field of battle, would
probably
have been the case.
The old earl had sent the wedding gifts
to his sou's chosen bride, had promised to
be present at the nuptials, the day of
which was fixed already; but it had been
decided that when De Vaux should be
forced to join the royal armies his young
wife should continue to reside at
Ingleborough
,
with her bereaved mother and fond
sister, until the wished-for peace should
unite England once again in bonds of
general amity; and the bridegroom find
honorable leisure to lead his wife in state
to his paternal mansions.
Days sped a wayhow fast they seemed
to fly to those young happy lovers! How
was the very hour of their first interview
noted, and marked with while in the deep
tablets of their mindshow did they shyly,
half, half fondly recount each to the other
the first impressions of their growing
fondnesshow did they bless the cause
that brought them thus together.
proh
cca mens mortalium!
oh! the
short-sighted
scope of mortal vision! alas! for one
for both!
The wedding day was fixed, and now
was fast approaching; and hourly was
Marian, with their good uncle and his
dame, expected at the Hall, and wished
for, and discoursed of by the lovers
and oh!would Annabel say, half
sportively, and half in earnestwell
was it for my happiness, De Vaux, that
she
was absent when you first came hither,
for had you seen
her
first, her far superior
beauty, her bright wild radiant face, her
rare arch
naivete
, her flashing wit, and
beautiful enthusiasm would
must
have
captivated you all at onceand what had
then become of your poor Annabel?
And then would the young lord vow
that had he met her first in the most
glorious
courts of Europe, with all the
gorgeous
beauties of the world to rival her, she
would alone have been the choice of his
soulhis soul, first touched by her, of
woman! And then he would ask in
lowered tones, and with a sly simplicity
of manner, whether if
he
had loved
another
,
she could have still loved him; to
which, with all the frank and fearless
purity that was so beautiful a trait in
Annabel
Oh
yes she would reply, and
gaze with calm reliance, as she did so,
into her lover's eyesoh yes, dear
Eruestand then how miserably wretched
must I have been through my whole life
hereafter. Oh! yes, I loved youthough
then I knew it not, nor indeed thought at
all about it, until you spoke to meI
loved you dearly!and I believe it would
almost have killed me to look upon you
afterwards as the wife of another.
The wedding day was but a fortnight
distant; and strange to say it was the
very day, two months gone, which had
seen their meeting. Wains had arrived
from Gilsland, loaded with arms and
uniforms
,
standards and ammunitions; two
brothers of young De Vaux, young
gallant
cavaliers, had come, partly to officer
the men, partly to do fit honor to their
brother's nuptials.
The day, although the season had now
advanced far into brown October, was
sunny, mild, and beautiful; the regiment
had, for the first time, mustered in arms in
Ingleborough park, and a gay show they
made, with their glittering casques and
corslets, fresh from the armorer's anvil,
and their fluttering scarfs, and dancing
plumes, and bright emblazoned banners.
The sun was in the act of settingDe
Vaux and Annabel were watching his
decline
from the same window in the Hall
whence she had first discovered his
unexpected
coming; when, as on that all
eventful evening, a little dust was seen
arising on the high road beyond the river;
and, in a moment, a small mounted party
became visible, amidst which might be
readily descried the fluttering of female
garments!
It is my sisterexclaimed Annabel,
jumping up on the instant, and clasping
her hands eagerlyit is my dear, dear
sistercome, Ernest, come, let us go and
meet dear Marian. No time was lost,
but arm-in-arm the lovers sallied forth,
and met the little train just on this side of
the park-gate.
Marian sprang from her horse, light as
a spirit of the air, and rushed into her
sister's arms, and clung there with a long
and lingering embrace, and as she raised
her head, a bright tear glittered on either
silky eyelash. De Vaux advanced to
greet her, but as he did so, earnestly
perusing
the lineaments of his fair future
sister, he was most obviously
embarrassed
,
his manner was confused, and even
agitated, his words falteredand
she
,
whose face had been, a second before,
beaming with the bright crimson of
excitement
whose
eye had looked round
eagerly and gladly to mark the chosen of
her sister
she
turned as pale as ashes
brow, cheeks, and lipspale, almost
livid!and her eye fell abashed, and did
not rise again till he had finished speaking.
None noticed it but Annabel; for all the
party were engaged in gay
congratulations
,
andthey recovering themselves
immediatelynothing more passed, that
could create surmisebut
she
did notice
it, and her heart sauk for a moment, and
all that evening she was unnsually grave
and silent; and, had not her usual
demeanor
been so exceedingly calm and
subdued, her strange dejection must have
been seen, and wondered at, by her
assembled
kinsfolk.
CHAPTER VI.
The
morning after Marian's arrival at the
Manor, was one of those bright lovely
dawns, sure harbingers of sweet and
sunny days, that often interrupt the
melancholy
progress of an English autumn;
fairer and softer, as the season waxed
older, and more enchanting from the
contrast
,
which they cannot fail to suggest,
between their balmy mildness, and the
chill winds and gloomy fogs of the
approaching
winter. The sky was
altogether
cloudless, yet it had nothing of the
deep azure hue which it presents in
summer
,
resembling in its tints and its
transparency
,
a canopy, if such a thing could
be, of living aqua-marine, and kindled by
a flood of pure, pale yellow lustre.
None of the trees were wholly leafless,
though none, perhaps, unless it were a
few old oaks, but had lost something of
their summer foliage; and their changed
colors varying from the deepest green,
through all the shades of yellow, down to
the darkest amber, although prophetic of
their coming doom, and therefore
saddening
,
with a sort of chastened spiritual
sorrow, the heart of the observer, added a
solemn beauty to the scenery, that well
accorded with its grand and romantic
character.
The vast round-headed hills, seen
through the filmy haze which floated over
them, filling up their dells and hollows,
showed every intermediate hue from the
red russet of their heathery foreground, to
the rich parple of their furthest peaks.
The grass, which had not yet begun to
lose its verdant freshness, was thickly
meshed with gossamer, all sprinkled by
the pure and plenteous dews, and
flashing
like a net of diamonds upon a ground
of emerald velvet, to the early sunbeams.
It was summerlate indeed in that
lovely season, but still full summer, with
all her garuiture of green, her pomp of
full blown flowersthe glorious mature
womanhood of the year! when Marian
left her home. Not a trace of deeay or
change was visible on its bright brow, not
a leaf of its embroideries was altered, not
a bud in its garland was blighted. She
had returned; and everything, though
beautiful and glowing, bore the plain
stamp of approaching dissolution. The
west wind blew as softly as in June
through the tall sycamores, but after every
breath, while all was lulled and peaceful,
the broad sere leaves came whirling down
from the shaken branches, on which their
hold was now so slight, that but the
whisper
of a sigh was needed to detach them;
the skiesthe waterswere as pure as
ever, as beautifully clear and lucid, but
in their brightness there was a chill and
glassy glitter, as different from their warm
sheen under a July sun, as is the keen
unnatural
radiance of a blue eye in the
consumptive
girl, from its rich lustrous light
in a mature and healthy woman.
Was it the contemplation of this change
that brought so sad a cloud over the brow
of lovely Marian Hawkwood; so dull a
gloom into her speaking eye; so dread a
paleness upon the ripe damask of her
cheek? Sad indeed always is such
contemplation
sorrowful
and grave thoughts
must it awake in the minds of those who
think the least, to revisit a fair
well-known
scene which they have quitted in
the festal flush of summer, when all the
loveliness they dwelt on so fondly is
flown or flying. It brings a chill upon the
spirit, like that which touches the last
guest,
Who treads alone
Some banquet hall deserted,
Whose lights are fled,
Whose garlands dead,
And all save he departed.
It makes a passing anguish, like that
which thrills to the heart's core of him,
who, after years of wandering in a foreign
clime, returns to find the father, whom he
left still in the prime of vigorous and
active
manhood, howed, hent, grey-haired,
and paralytie; the mother, whom he saw
at their last parting, glorious in summer
beauty, withered, and wrinkled, and
bereft
of every trace of former comeliness
All this it doesat times to all! to the
reflective
always!the solitary
contemplation
of the decaying year.
Yet it was not this alone, it was not this
at all
, that blanched the cheek and
dimmed
the glance of Marian, as at a very
early hour of the morning she was
sauntering
alone, with downcast eyes and slow
uncertain gait, beside the margin of the
stream, in the sheltered garden. For she
did not, in truth, seem to contemplate at
2
all the face of external nature, or so much
as to note the changes which had taken
place during her absence; yet were those
changes very great, and nowhere
probably
so strongly marked as in the very spot
where she was wandering, for when she
stood there last to cull a nosegay, ere she
parted, the whole of that fair nook was
glowing with the brightest colors, and
redolent
with the most fragrant perfumes,
while hundreds of feathered songsters
were filling every brake and thicket with
bursts of joyous melodyand now only a
few, the hardiest of the late autumnal
flowers, displayed their scattered blossoms,
and those too crisp and faded, among sere
leaves and withered branches; while, for
the mellow warblings of the thrush and
black-bird, nothing was heard except the
feeble piping of a solitary robin, mixed
with the wailing rush of the swollen
streamlet.
For nearly an hour she walked to and
fro buried in deep and melancholy silence,
and thinking, as it seemed from her air and
gestures, most profoundlyoccasionally
she paused for a few seconds in her walk
to and fro, and stood still, gazing
abstractedly
on some spot in the withered
herbage
,
on some pool of the bronkler, with
her mind evidently far away, and once or
twice she clasped her hands, and wrung
them passionately, and sighed very
deeply
.
While she was yielding thus to some
deep inward sorrowfor it could be no
trivial passing grief that had so suddenly
and so completely changed so quick and
gay a spirita gentle footstep sounded
upon the gravel walk, behind a cluster of
thick leafy lilacs, and in a moment
Annabel
stepped from their screen upon the
mossy greensward. Her pale and pensive
features were even paler and more
thoughtful than was common, and her
eyes showed as if she had been weeping,
yet her step was as light and elastic as a
young fawn's, and a bright smile dimpled
her cheek, as she addressed her sister.
Dear Marian, why so early? And
why did you not call me to share your
morning walk? What ails you, dearest,
tell me? For I have seen you, from my
window, walking here up and down so
sorrowful and sad
Oh, can you ask mecan you ask me,
Annabel? exclaimed the lovely girl, in a
wild earnest burst of passioncan you
not see that my heart is breaking? and
with the words she flung her arms about
her sister's neck, and burying her face in
her bosom fell into an agony of tears.
Annabel clasped Marian to her heart, and
held her there for many moments, kissing
away the big drops from her cheeks, and
soothing her with many a kind and soft
caress, before she replied to her
incoherent
and wild wordsbut when her
violent
sobbing had subsided,
Dearest, she said, I do not
understand
at all, nor can I even guess, what
has so grievously afflicted youbut, if
you fancy that we shall be parted, that
our lives will hereafter be divided, and
weep for that fond fancy, it is but a false
apprehension that distresses you. I go
not heuce at all, dear sister, until these
fearful wars he over; and, then, I go not
till the course of time shall place De Vaux
in his good father's station, whichI pray
Heavenshall not fall out for years. And
when I do gowhen I do go away from
this dear happy spot, you cannot, no, you
did
not dream, my sister, that you should
not go with me. Oh, if you did dream
that, it would be very hard for me to
pardon you.
Oh, nono! no! dear Annabel,
replied
the other, not lifting up her eyes
from the fond bosom on which she hung
so heavily, and speaking in a thick husky
voice, it is not that at allbut I am so
unhappyso miserableso despairing!
Oh, would to Godoh, would to God!
that I had never gone henceor that
Ernest
De Vaux, at least, had not come
hither!
Nay! now, I must know what you
mean, Annable answered mildly, but at
the same time very firmlyI must,
indeed
,
dear Marianfor either such words
have a meaning, in which case it is
absolutely
right that I
your
sister and
his
affianced
wife should know itor if they
have not any, are cruel equally, and
foolish
.
So tell metell me, dear one, if
there be aught that I should know; and,
in all cases, let me share your sorrow.
Oh! do notdo not ask me, Annabel;
oh! oh! to think that we two, who have
been so happy, should be wretched now.
I know not what you would say,
Marian; but your strange words awake
strange thoughts within me! We have
indeed, been happy! fond, happy,
innocent
,
dear sistersand I can see no cause
why we should now be otherwiseI, at
least, am still happy, Marian, unless it be
to witness your wild sorrow; and, if I
know myself, no earthly sorrow would
ever make me wretched, much less
repining
,
or despairing.
Yes, youyes, you indeed may yet
be happy, blessed with a cheerful home, a
noble gallant husband, and it may be, one
day, sweet prattlers at your knee, but, I
oh! God! and she again burst into a
fierce agony of tears and sobbing. Her
sister, for a time, strove to console her,
but she soon found not only that her
efforts were in vain, but that, so far as she
could judge, Marian's tears only flowed
the faster, her sobs became more
suffocating
,
the more she would have soothed
them. When she became aware of this,
then she withdrew gradually her arms
from her waist, and spoke to her in a calm
melancholy voice, full at the same time
of deep sadness, and firm decided
resolution
.
Marian, she said, I see, and how I
am grieved to see it, no words can
possibly
express, that you look not to me for
sympathy or consolationnay more, that
you shrink back from my earesses, as if
they were insincere or hateful to you.
Your words, too, are so wild and whirling,
that for my life. I cannot guess what is
their meaning, or their causeI only can
suspect, or, I should rather say, can only
dread
, that you have suffered some very
grievous wrong, or done some very
grievous
sin; and as I must believe the last
impossible
,
my fears still centre on the first
dark apprehension. Could you confide
in me, I might advise, might aid, and
could at least, most certainly, console
you! Why you cannot, or will not trust
me,
you
can know
only
. Side by side
have we grown up, since we were little
tottering things, guiding our weak steps
hand in hand in mutual dependence,
seldom
apart, I might say
never
for now,
since you have been away, I have
thought of you half the day, and dreamed
of you all nightmy earhest comrade, my
best friend, my own, my only sister!
And now we are two grown up maidens,
with no one exactly fit to couusel or
console
us, except ourselves alonesince it
has pleased our Heavenly Father, in his
wisdom, for so long to deprive us of our
dear mother's guidance. We are two lone
girls, Marian, and never yet, so far as I
know or can recollect, have we had aught
to be ashamed of, or any secret one
should not have communicated to the
other. And now there is not one thought
in my mind, one feeling or affection in my
heart, which I would hide from you, my
sister. What then can be this heavy sin,
or sorrow, which you are now ashamed,
or fearful, to relate to one, who surely
loves you, as no one else can do, beneath
the canopy of Heaven' Marian, you
must reply to me in full, or I must leave
you till better thoughts shall be awakened
in your soul, and till you judge more truly
of those who most esteem you.
Too true! it is too true! Marian re
pliedno one has ever loved me as you
have done, sweet Annabeland now, no
one will love me any moreno oneno
one, for ever. But you are wrong, quite
wrong, when you suppose that any one
has injured me, or that as yet I have
done
any wrong; alas! alas! that I should even
have
thought
sin! Oh! noAnnabel, dear
Annabel, I will bear all my woes myself
and God will give me grace to conquer
all temptations. Pardon me, sister dear,
pardou me; for it is not that I am
ashamed
,
or that I fear to tell youbut that to
save my own life, I would not plant one
thorn in your calm bosom. No! I will
see you happy; and will resist the evil
one, that he shall flee from me; and God
will give me strength, and you will pray
for me, and we shall
all
be blessed.
As she spoke thus, the wildness and
the strangeness of her manner passed
away, and a calm smile flickered across
her features, and she looked her sister
steadfastly in the eye, and cast her arms
about her neck, and kissed her tenderly
as she finished speaking.
But it was plain to see that Annabel
was by no meaus satisfied; whether it was
that she was anxious merely, and uneasy
about the discomposure of her sister's
mind; or whether something of suspicion
had disturbed the even tenor of her own,
appeared not; her color came and went,
more quickly than was usual to her, and
the glance of her gentle blue eye dwelt
with a doubting and irresolute expression
on Marian's face, as she made answer:
Very glad am I that, as you tell me,
Marian, you have not suffered aught, or
done anght eviland I trust that you tell
me truly. Beyond this, I cannotI
cannot
,
I confess it, sympathize with you at
all; for in order to sympathize, one must
understand, and that, you know, I do not.
What sin you should have thought of, I
cannot so much as conceivebut as you
say you have resisted your temptations
hithertobut, oh, what possible
temptations
to aught evil, can have beset you in
this dear peaceful home? I cannot not
that you will be strengthened to resist
them further. You tell me, Marian, that
you would not plant a thorn in my calm
bosomit is true that my bosom was calm
yester-morn, and very happybut now I
should speak falsely, were I to say that it
is so. What
thorn
you would plant in
my heart, I know not, by speaking
openly
nor
how you could suppose itbut
this I
do know
, Marian, that you have set
distrust, and dark suspicion and deep
sorrow
in my soul this morning. Distrust of
yourself, dear Marianfor what can these
half confidences breed except distrust?
suspicion, of I know notwish not to
knowdare not to fancy whatdeep
sorrow
that, already, even from one short
separation, a great gulf is spread out
between us. I will not press you
now
to
tell me any more; but this I must impress
upon you, that you have laid a burden
upon me, which, save you only, no
earthly
being can remove; which nothing can
alleviate except its prompt removal.
Nay! Marian, nay! answer me nothing
nownothing in this strong heat of
passionate
emotion! think of it at your calmer
leisure, and, if you can, in duty to yourself
and others, give me your ample
confidence
.
I pray you, Marian, do so. In
the meantime go to your chamber,
dearest
and
wipe away these traces of your
tears, and re-arrange your hair. Our guests
will be assembled before this, and I have
promised Ernest that we will all ride out,
and see his falcons fly, this beautiful
morning
.
Marian made no reply at all, but
following
her sister into the house, hurried
up to her chamber, to re-adjust her
garments
,
and remove from her face the signs
of her late disorder. Meanwhile, sad and
suspicious, of she knew not what, and
only by a violent effort concealing her
heart-felt anxiety, Annabel joined her
guests in the pleasant summer parlor. All
were assembled when she entered, and
all the preparations for the morning meal
duly arranged upon the hospitable board
the morning meal, how widely
different
from that of modern days, how
characteristic
of those strong stirring times,
when every gentleman was from his
boyhood
half a soldier, when every lady was
prepared for deeds of heroism. There
were no luxuries, effeminate and
childish
,
of tea and chocolate, or coffee,
although
the latter articles were just
beginning
to be known; no dry toast or hot
muffins; nor aught else of those things,
which we now consider the
indispensables
of the first meal but silver flagons
mantling with mighty ale, and flasks of
Bordeaux wine, and of rich canary,
crowned the rich board, which groaned
beneath sirloins of beef, and hams, heads
of the wild boar, and venison pasties, and
many kinds of game and wild fowl.
Ernest De Vaux arose, as Annabel came
in, from the seat which he had occupied
by the good vicar's lady, whom he had
been regaling with a thousand anecdotes
of the court, and as many gay descriptions
of the last modes, till she had quite made
up her mind that he was absolute
perfection
,
and hastened forward to offer her
his morning salutation, but there was
something of embarrassment in
his
demeanor
,
something of coldness in
her
manner
,
which was perceived for a moment
by all her relatives and friends; but it
passed away, as it were, in a moment;
for, by an effort, he recovered almost
instautly
his self-possession, and began
talking
with light, careless pleasantry, that
raised a smile upon the lips of all who
heard him, and had the effect immediately
of chasing the cloud from the brow of
Annabel
,
who, after a few minutes, as if she
had done injustice to her lover in her heart,
and was desirous of effacing its
remembrance
both from herself and him, gave
free rein to her feelings, and was the
same sweet, joyous creature that she had
been, since his arrival had awakened new
sensations and new dreams in her young,
guileless heart.
Then, before half an hour had elapsed,
more beautiful, perhaps, than ever,
Marian
made her appearance. Her rich
profusion
of brown curls clustered on her
cheeks, and flowed down her neck from
beneath a slashed Spanish hat of velvet,
with a long ostrich feather, and her
unrivalled
figure was set off to more than
usual advantage, by the long waist and
flowing draperies of her green velvet
riding dress. Her face was, perhaps,
somewhat paler than its ordinary hue,
when she first entered, but as she met the
eye of Ernest, brow, cheeks, and neck,
were crimsoned with a burning flush,
which passed away, however, instantly,
leaving her not the least embarrassed or
confused, but perfectly collected, and as
it seemed, full of a quiet, innocent
mirthfulness
.
Nothing could be more perfect than was
her manner, during the long protracted
meal, towards her sister's lover. She
seemed to feel towards him, already, as if
he were a tried friend and brother. Her
air was perfectly familiar, as she addressed
him, yet free from the least touch of
forwardness
,
the slightest levity or
coquettishness
.
She met his admiring gaze
for he did, at times, gaze on her with
visible admirationyet admiration of so
quiet and unpassionate a kind, as a good
brother might bestow upon a sister's
beauty
with
calm unconsciousness, or with
a girlish mirth, that defied
misconstruction
.
And Annabel looked onalas for
Annabel
!and
felt her doubts and suspicions
vanishing away every moment. The
vague distrust that had crept into her
heart, melted away like mist wreaths
from before the sun-beam. She only
wondered now, what the anxiety, what
the distrust could possibly have been,
which, for a moment, had half maddened
her.
Then she began to marvel, what could
the sorrow be which, scarce an hour
before
,
had weighed so heavily on Marian;
and which had in that brief space so
utterly
departed. It must be, she
thought, as she gazed on her pure,
speaking
features, and the clear sparkle of her
bright blue eye, that she too loves, loves
possibly in vain; that she has lost her
young heart during her absence from her
home; and has now overmastered her
despair, her soul-consuming anguish, to
sympathize in her sister's happiness; and
then she fancied how she would win from
her that secret sorrow, and soothe it till
she should forget the faithless one, and
tend her with a mother's fond anxiety.
Alas! alas! for Annabel!
CHAPTER VII.
The
morning meal was ended; the sun
already high in the clear heavens, and the
thin mist wreaths were dispersing from
the broad valley, and the bright river; and
now a merry cavalcade swept round the
lawn from the stables, a dozen foresters
and grooms, well mounted, with led
horses
,
two of the latter decked with velvet
side saddles, which were then used by
ladies, and seven or eight serving men, on
foot, with hounds and spauiels in their
leashes, and among them, conspicnous
above the rest, the falconer, with his
attendants
,
one bearing a large frame
whereon
were
cast
such was the technical
jargon
used in the mystery of trainers
eight or ten long-winged falcons,
goshawks
,
and gerfalcons, and peregrines,
with all their gay paraphernalia of hoods,
and bells, and jesses.
A little while afterwards the fair girls
came ont, Annabel now attired like her
sister in the velvet riding robe, and the
slashed, graceful hat, and were assisted to
their saddles by the young lover. Then
he, too, bounded to his noble charger's
back and the others of the company in
their turn mounted, and the whole party
rode off, merrily, to the green meadows
by the fair river's side.
Away! away! the spaniels are
uncoupled
,
and questing far and wide
among the long green flags, and water
briony, and mallows, that fringe the banks
of many a creek and inlet of the river
over the russet stubblesup the thick
alder coppices, that fringe the steep
ravines
.
Away! away! the smooth soft turf, the
slight and brushy hedges, invite the free
and easy gallop, invite the fearless leap!
Away! with hawk unhooded on the wrist
and readywith graceful seat, light hand,
and bounding heart! See how the busy
spaniels snuff the hot scent, and ply their
feathery tails among the dry fern on the
bank of that old sunny ditch; there has
the game been latelyhold hard, bold
cavaliershold hard, my gentle ladies!
hurry not now the dogs. Hush! hark! the
black King Charles is whimpering already:
that beautiful-long-eared and silk water
spaniel joins in the subdued chorushow
they thread in and out the withering
fernstalks
,
how they rush through the
crackling
bramples! Yaff! yaff!now they
give tongue aloudyaff! yaff! yaff! yaff!
and whir-r-r upsprings the well grown
coveynow give your hearts to the loud
whoop!now fling your hawks aloft!
now gather well your bridles in your
hands, now spur your gallant horseson!
on! sweep over the low fence, skim the
green meadow, dash at the rapid brook
ladies and cavaliers pell-mellall riding
for themselves and careless of the rest,
forgetful
of all fear, all thought, in the fierce,
fast career, as with eyes all turned
heaven-ward
to mark the soaring contest of the
birds, trusting their goods steeds only, to
bear them swift and safely, they drive in
giddy routes down the broad valley.
And now the flight is overeach
gallant
hawk has struck his cowering quarry
the lures are shaken in the air, the
falconer's
whoop and whistle recalls the
hovering falcon, and on they go at slower
pace to beat for frsh gameand lo!
flip-flap
,
there rises the first woodcock of the
season.
Ho! mark himmark him down, good
foresterwe must not miss that fellow
the very prince of gamethe king he
would be, save that grey heronshaw of
right has old claim to the throne of
falconrie
!
Lo! there, my masters, he is down
down in that gulley's bank, where the
broom and the branchens feather the
sunny slope, and the long, rank grasses,
that seen almost to choke its mossy
runuel.
Quick! quick! unhood the lanner
the young and speckled-breasted lanner!
cast off the old grey-headed gerfalcon
soh, Diamond, my brave bird! mark his
quick, glancing eye, and his proud crest,
soh? cast him off, and he will wheel
around our heads, nor leave us till we
flush the woodcock. No! no! hold the
young lanner hard, let him not fly, he is
too mettlesome and proud of wing to trust
toand couple all the dogs up, except the
staunch red setter.
Now we will steal on him up wind,
and give him very chance.
Best cross the gully here, fair dames,
for it is something deep and boggy, and
if ye were to brave it, in the fury of the
gallop, you might be mired for your
pains.
That bird will show you sport; be
sure of it, for lo! the field beyond is
thickly set with stunted thorns, and tufts
of alder bushes; if your hawks be not
keen of sight, and quick of wing, too, be
sure that he will dodge them; and if he
reach you hill-side only, all covered as it
is with evergreens, dense holly brakes,
and thick oak saplings, he is as safe there
in that covert, as though he were a
thousand
leagues away in some deep glen of
the wild Atlas Mountains.
Lo! there he goes, the grey hawk after
himby heaven! in fair speed he
outstrips
the gerfalcon, he does not
condescend
to dodge or double, but flies wild
and high towards the purple moorland, and
there we cannot follow him.
Ride, De Vaux, gallop for your life
cut in, cut in between the bird and the
near ridgesoh! bravely done black
chargernow cast the lanner loose! so!
that will turn him.
See! he has turned; and now he
must work for itthe angle he has made
has brought old Diamond up against me
weather wingnow! he will strikenow!
now!
But lo! the wary bird has dodged, and
the hawk who had soared, and was in the
act of pouncing, checked his fleet pinion
and turned after himhow swift he flies
dead in the wind's eyeand the wind is
rising; he cannot face it nowtack and
tack, how he twistshow cleverly he
beats to wind ward; but now the odds are
terribly against him, the cunning falcons
have divided, and are now flying sharply
to cut him off, one at each termination of
his tacksthe lanner has outstripped
him.
Whoop! Robin, whoop!soh! call
him up to the windup to the wind,
falconer
,

his castno swallow ever winged it
swifter than the wild bird of passagenot
now does he fly high among the clouds,
but skims the very surface of the lawn,
twisting round every tree and baffing the
keen falcons.
Now he is scarce ten paces from his
covert; the old bird, Diamond, flying like
lightning, struggles in vain to weather
himin vainthe game dashes behind
the boll of a tall upright oak, darts down
among the hollies and is lostwell flown

hawkthe brave old hawk, bent only on
retrieving his lost flight, his eye set too
steadily on the bird which he so fiercely
struggled to outfly, has dashed with the
full impetus of his arrowy flight against
the gnarled stem of the oak; he rebounds
from it like a ball from the iron target
never so much as once flaps his fleet
pinions
;
tears not the ground with beak or
claw. Diamond, brave Diamond is dead
and pitying eyes look down on him;
and gentle tears are shed; and the soft
hands that were wont to fondle his high
crest and smoothe his ruffled wings,
compose
his shattered pinions, and sleek his
blood-stained plumagealas, brave
Diamond

Another flightanother glowing gallop
to make the blood dance blithely in our
veinsto drive dull care from our hearts!
But no, the sylvan meal is spread
down by that leafy nook, under the still
green canopy of that gigantic oak, where
the pure spring wells out so clear and
limpid, from the bright yellow gravel
under
its gnarled and tortnous rootsthere
is the snow-white linen spread on the
mossy green sward; there the cold pasty
and the larded capon tempt the keen
appetite
of the jolly sportsman; there,
plunged
in the glassy waters, the tall flasks of
champagne are cooling! Who knows not
the delicious zest with which we banquet
on the green sward; the merry joyous
ease which, all restraint and ceremonial
banished, renders the sylvan meal, in the
cool shadow by the rippling brook, so
indescribably
delightful? And all who were
collected there were for the moment
happy!and many, in sad after days,
remembered
that gay feast, and dwelt upon
the young hopes, which were so flattering
then, hopes which so soon decayedand
lingered on the contemplation of that soon
perished bliss, as if the great Italian had
erred, when he declared so wisely that to
the sons of man
Nessum maggior dolore
Che ricordarsi del tiempo felice
Nella miseria.
The bright wine sparkled in the gohlet,
but brighter flashed the azure eyes of
Marian, for her whole face was radiant
with wild starry beauty. Was it the
thrilling
rapture of the gallop, that sent her
blood boiling with strange excitement
through every petty artery of her body
was it the spirit stirring chase alone, or
did the rich blood of the Gallic grape,
sparingly tasted though it was, lend
something
of unnatural power? hark to the
silvery tones of that sweet ringing laugh
and now how deep a blush mantles her
brow, her neck, her bosom, when in
receiving
her glass from the hand of Ernest,
their fingers mingled for a moment
But Ernest is unmoved, and calm, and
seemingly unconsciousand Annabel,
fond Annabel, rejoices to mark her sister's
spirits so happily, so fully, as it seems,
recovered
from that over-mastering sorrow.
She saw not the hot blush, she noted not
its causeand yet, can it becan it be
that casual pressure was the cause?can
it be love?love for a sister's bridegroom,
that kindles so the eyethat flushes so
the cheekthat thrills so the life-blood of
lovely Marian? Away! away with
contemplation
.
Ernest reflects not, for his brow is
smooth and all unruffled by a thought, his
lips are smiling, his pulse calm and
temperate
and
Marian pauses notand
Annabel
suspects notHush! they are
singing
.
Lo! how the sweet and flute-like
tones of the fair girls are blended with the
rich and deep contralto of De Vaux. Lo!
they are singingsinging the wood notes
wild of the great master of the soul
Heigho! sing heigho! under the green holly!
Most friendship is feigning,
Most loving mere folly!
Alas! for trusting Annabel!soon shall
she wake from her fond dream, soon wake
to woe, to anguish. Again they mount
their steeds, again they sweep the
meadows
,
down to the very brink of the broad
deep transparent Wharfeand now the
heronshaw is sprunghe flaps his dark
grey vans, the hermit bird of the waters,
and slowly soars away, till the falconer's
shrill whoop, and the sharp whistling
flutter
of the fleet pinions in his rear arouse
him to his dangerup! up! he soarsup!
up! scaling to the very sky in small but
swift gyrationswhile side by side the
well matched falcons wheel circling
around him still, and still out-topping him,
till all the three are lost in the grey fleecy
cloudsthe clouds!no one had seen
no one has even dreamed, engrossed in the
wild fervor of the sport, that all the sky
was overclouded; and the thick blackness
of the thunderstorm, driving up wind, and
settling down in terrible proximity to the
earth, was upon them unseen and
unexpected
.
Away! away! what heed they, the dark
storm-cloudsthe increasing flash?these
bold equestrians! Heavens! what a flash
how keen! how close! how livid! the
whole horizon shone out for a moment's
space one broad blue glare of fearful
living
lightand simultaneously the thunder
burst above thema crash as of ten
thousand
pieces of earth's heaviest ordnance,
shot off in one wild clatter. The horses
of the party were all careering at their
speed, their maddest speed, across a broad
green pasture, bordered on the right hand
by the wide channel of the Wharfe, and
on the left by an impracticable fence of
tall old thorns, with a deep ditch on either
side, and a stout timber railing. The two
fair sisters were in front, leading the
joyous
cavalcade, with their eyes in the
clouds, their hearts full of the fire of the
chase, when that broad dazzling glare
burst full in their faces.
Terrified by the livid flash and the
appalling
crash of the reverberated thunder,
the horses of the sisters bolted diverse
Annabel's towards the broad rapid Wharfe,
between which and the meadow through
which they had been so joyously
careering
,
there was no fence or barriers at the
spot where they were then riding
Marian's
towards the dangerous oxfence, which
has been mentioned! The charger of De
Vaux, who rode next behind them,
started
indeed, and whirled about, but was
almost immediately controlled by the
strong arm and skilful horsemanship of
his bold rider; but of the grooms who
followed
,
several were instantly dismounted,
and there were only three or four who,
mastering their terrified and fractious
beasts, galloped off to the aid of their
young mistresses. They were both good
equestrians, and ordinarily fearless, but in
such peril what woman could preserve
her wonted intrepidity unshakenthe sky
as black as night, with ever and anon a
sharp clear stream of the electric fluid
dividing
the dark storm clouds, and the
continuous
thunder rolling and crashing
overhead
their
horses mad with terror, and
endowed by that very madness with
tenfold
speed and strength!Annabel, whose
clear head, and calm, though resolute
temper, gave her no small advantage over
her volatile impetuous sister, sat, it is true,
as firmly in her saddle, as though she had
been practising her menage in the riding
schooland held her fiery jennet with a
firm steady hand; but naturally her
strength was insufficient to control its
fierce and headlong speed; so that she
saw upon the instant, that she must be
carried into the whirling waters of the
swift riverfor a moment she thought of
casting herself to the ground, but it
scarcely required one moment of
reflection
to show her that such a course could
lead but to destruction. So on she drove,
erect and steady in her seat, guiding her
horse well, and keeping its head straight
to the river bank, and hoping every
instant
to hear the tramp of De Vaux's
charger
overtaking her, and bringing succor
alas! for Annabel!the first sound that
distinctly met her ears was a wild
piercing
shriekErnestgreat God!
my
Ernest
help
me!save me! It was the
voice of Marian, the voice of her own
cherished sister, calling on her betrothed
and he? Even in that dread peril, when
life was on a cast, her woman heart
prevailed
above her woman fear, she turned,
and saw the steed of Marian rushing with
the bit between his teeth towards the
dangerous
fence, which lay, however, far more
distant than the river to which her own
horse was in terrible proximity! and he,
her promised husband, the lord of her
soul, he for whom
she
would have
perished
oh,
how willingly!perished with
but the one regret of that reparationhe
had overlooked entirely, or heeded not at
least,
her
peril to whom his faith was
sworn; and even before that wild
appealing
cry, had started in pursuitand was,
as she looked round, in the act of whirling
Marian from her saddle with one hand,
while with the other he controlled his
own strong war horse.
When she first heard that cry, her
spirit sank within herbut when she saw
herself deserted, when the drear
consciousness
that she was not beloved, broke
on her, it seemed as if an icebolt had
pierced her heart of hearts! her eyes
grew dim! there was a sound of rushing
waters in her ear! not the sound of the
rushing river, although her horse was
straining now up the last ascent that
banked it! her pulse stood still! Had
Annabel then died, the bitterness of death
was over. Before, however, she had so
much as wavered in her saddle, much less
lost rein or stirrup, a wild plunge, and the
shock which ran through every nerve, as
her horse leaped into the brimful river,
awoke her for the moment to her present
situationunconsciously she had
retained
her seather horse was swimming
boldlya loud plunge sounded from be
hind! another, and another! and the next
instant her steed's head was seized by the
stalwart arm of a young falconer, and
turned towards the shore she had just
quitted; her brain reeled round, and she
again was senselessthus was she borne
to land, without the aid or intervention of
him, who should have been the first to
venture all, to lose all, for her safety.
Alas! alas! for Annabel!
CHAPTER VIII.
When
next she opened her eyes, she
lay on her own bed, in her own
well-known
chamber, and the old nurse with
the good vicar's wife, was watching over
her. As her lids rose and she looked about
her, all her intelligence returned upon the
moment; and she was perfectly aware of
all that had already passed, of all that she
had still to undergo. Well, she replied,
to the eager and repeated inquiries after
the state of her bodily and mental
sensations
,
which were poured out from the
lips of her assiduous watchersOh! I
feel quite well, I do assure youI was
not hurt at allnot in the leastonly I
was so foolish as to faint from terror.
But Marian, how is Marian?
Not injured in the leastbut very
anxious
about you, sweet Annabel, replied
mistress Summers, so much so, that I
was obliged to force her from the
chamber
,
so terrible was her griefso violent
her terror and excitement. Lord De Vaux
snatched her from her horse, and saved
her before he even saw your danger; he,
too, is in a fearful state of mind; he has
been at the door twenty times, I believe,
within the hour; hark, that is his foot now,
will you see him, dearest?
A quick and chilly shudder ran through
the whole frame of the lovely girl, and a
faint hue glowed once again in her pale
cheek; but mastering her feelings, she
made answer in her own notes of sweet
calm music.
Not yet, dear mistress Summers, not
yet; but tell him, I beseech you, that I am
betterwell, indeed! and will receive his
visit by and by; and in the meantime,
my good friend, I must see Marianmust
see her directly, and alone. No! no! you
must not hinder me of my desire, you
know, she went on, with a faint and very
melancholy smile, you know of old, I
am a wilful stubborn girl when I make up
my mind, and it is quite made up now,
my good friend! so, I pray you let me
see her, I am quite strong, I do assure you,
so do, I beseech you, go and console my
Lord De Vaux, and let nurse bring me
Marian hither.
So firmly did she speak, and so resolved
was the expression of her soft gentle
features
,
that they no longer hesitated to
comply with her request; and both retired
with soft steps from the chamber.
Then Annabel half uprose from the
pillows
,
which had propped her, and clasped
her hands in attitude of prayer, and
turned
her beautiful eyes upwardher lips
moved visibly, not in irregular impulsive
starts, but with a smooth and ordered
motion
,
as she prayed fervently, indeed, but
tranquilly, for strength to do, and patience
to endure, and grace to do, and to
endure
,
alike with Christian love and
Christian
fortitude.
While she was thus engaged, a quick
uncertain footstep, now light and almost
tripping, now heavy and half faltering,
approached
the threshold; a gentle hand
raised the latch once, and again let it fall,
as if the comer was fluctuating between
the wish to enter, and some vague
apprehension
which for the moment conquered
the desire.
Is it you, Marian? asked the lovely
sufferer, oh come in, come in, sister!
and she did come in, that bright lovely
sufferer, her naturally high complexion
almost unnaturally brilliant now, from the
intensity of her hot blushes: her eyes
were downcast, and she could not so
much as look up into the sad sweet face
of Annabel. Her whole frame trembled
visibly, as she approached the bed, and
her foot faltered very much, yet she drew
near, and sitting down beside the pillow,
took Annabel's hand tenderly between her
own, and raised it to her warm lips, and
kissed it eagerly and often.
Never, for a moment's space, did the
eyes of Annabel swerve from her sister's
features, from the moment she entered the
door until she sat down by her side; but
rested on them, as if through them they
would peruse the secret soul with a soft,
gentle scrutiny, that savored not at all of
sternness or reproach. At last, as if she
was fully satisfied, she dropped her
eyelids
,
and for a little space, kept them
close shut; while again her lips moved
silently
,
and then pressing her sister's hand
fondly, she said in a quiet soothing voice,
as if she were alluding to an admitted
fact rather than asking a question,
So you have met him before, Marian?
A violent convulsion shook every limb
of her whom she addressed, and the
blood rushed in torrents to her brow; she
bowed her head upon her sister's hand,
and burst into a paroxysm of hysterical
tears and sobbing, but answered not a word.
Nay! nay! dear sister, exclaimed
Annabel, bending down over her, and
kissing
her neck, which, like her brow and
cheeks, was absolutely crimson, Nay!
nay! sweet Marian, weep not thus, I
beseech
you, there is no wrong donenone
at allthere was no wrong in your seeing
him, when you did soit was at York, I
must believenor in your
loving
him
either
,
when you did so; for I had not then
seen him, and of course could not love
him. But it was
not
right, sweetest
Marian
,
to let me be in ignorance of all this;
only think, dearest, only think what
would have been my agony, when I had
come to know, after I was a wife, that in
myself becoming happy, I had brought
misery on my second
self
, my own sweet
sister! nay, do not answer me yet, Marian;
for I can understand it all, thatalmost all,
that isand I quite appreciate
your
motives
,
I am sure that you did not know that
he loved you
, for he does love you, Marian!
but fancied that he loved me only, and so
resolved to control yourself, and crush
down your young affections, and sacrifice
yourself for me; thank God! oh! thank God,
that your strength was not equal to the task,
for had it been so, we had been wretched,
oh! most wretched. But you must tell me
all about it; for there is much I cannot
comprehendwhen did you see him
first, and where?why did he never so
much as hint to me, that he had known
you?why, when I wrote you word that
he was here, and afterward, that I liked,
loved, was about to marry himwhy did
you never write back that you knew him?
and why, above all, when you came and
found him herehere in your mother's
house, why did you meet him as a
stranger
?
I know it will be painful to you,
dear one; but you must bear the pain;
for it is necessary now, that there shall be
no more mistakes. Be sure of one thing,
dearest Marian, that I will never wed him;
oh! not for worlds! I could not sleep
one night, not one hour, in the thought
that my bliss was your bane; but if he
loves you as he ought, and as you love
him, sister, for I can read your soul, he
shall be yours at once; and I shall be
more happy somore happy ten-fold,
than pillowing my head upon a heart which
beats for anotherbut he must explain all
this, for I much fear me, he has dealt very
basely by us bothI fear me much he is a
bold, base man!
No! no! cried Marian, eagerly
raising
her clear eyes to her sister's, full of
ingenuous
truth and zealous fire. No! no!
he is all good, and true, and noble! I, it
is I only, who have for once been false
and wicked; not altogether wicked,
Annabel
,
perhaps more foolish than to blame,
at least in my intentions; but you
shall
hear
all; you
shall
hear all, Annabel, and then
judge for yourself, and then, still looking
her sister quite steadily and truthfully in
the face, she told her how at a ball in York,
she had met the young nobleman, who
had seemed pleased with her; had danced
with her many times, and visited her, but
never once named love, nor led her in the
least to fancy he esteemed her, beyond a
chance acquaintance, but I loved him,
oh!
how
I loved him, Annabel; almost
from the first time I saw him, and I feared
everever and onlythat by my bold,
frank rashness, he might discover his
power
,
and believe me forward and
unmaidenly
;
weeks passed, and our intimacy
ripened, and I became each hour more
fondly, more devotedly, more madly
for it was madness all!enamored of him.
He met me ever as a friend, no more!
The time came, when he was to leave
York, and as he took leave of me he told me
that he had just received despatches from
his
father, directing him to visit
mine;
and
I, shocked by the coolness of his parting
tone, and seeing indeed he had no love for
me, scarcely noting what he said, told him
not that I had
no father
, but I did tell him
that I had one sweet sister, and suddenly
extorted from him, unawares, a promise
that he would never tell you he had known
me; my manner, I am sure, was strange
and wild; and I have no doubt my words
were so likewise, for his demeanor altered
on the instant; his air, which had been
that of quiet friendship, became cool,
chilling, and almost disdainful, and within
a few minutes he took his leave, and we
never met again till yester even.
You will I doubt not, ask me
wherefore
I did all this! I was madmad with
love and disappointment. And the very
instant he said that he was coming hither, I
knew as certainly that he would love you
and you him, Annabel, as though it had
been palpably revealed to me. I could
not write of him to youI
could
not,
Annabel
,
and when your letters came, and
we learned that he was here, I confessed
all this to our aunt; and though she blamed
me much, for wild and thoughtless folly,
she thought it best to keep the matter
secret
.
This is the whole truth, Annabel
the whole truth! I fancied that the
absence
the
knowledge that I should see
him next my sister's husbandthe stern
resolve with which I bound my soul, had
made me strong enough to bear his
presence
I
tried it, and I found myself, how
weakthis is all, Annabel; can you
forgive
me, sister?
Sweet, innocent Marian, exclaimed
the elder sister through her tears, for she
had wept constantly through the whole
sad narration, there is not anything for
me to forgiveyou have wronged yourself
only, my sister! But yetbut yet!I
cannot
understand ithe must have seenno
man
could fail to see that one, so frank and
artless as you are, Marian, was in love with
himhe must, if not before, have known
it certainly, when you extorted from him,
as you call it, that strange promise.
Besides
he loves
you
, Marian; he loves you
then wherefore, in God's name! did he
woo mefor woo he did, and fervently,
and long, before he won me to confession?
oh! he is base!base, base, and bad at
heart, my sister!answer me nothing,
dear one, for I will prove him very shortly
send Margaret hither to array me. I will
go down and speak with him forth with
if he be honest, Marian, he is yoursand
think not that I sacrifice myself, when I
say this, for all the love I ever felt for him
has vanished utterly awayif he is honest,
he is yoursbut be not over confident,
dear child, for I believe he is notand if
not, why then, sweet Marian can we not
comfort one another, and live together as
we used, dear, innocent, united, happy
sisters? Do not reply now, Marianyour
heart is too fullhaste and do as I tell
you; before supper time to-night, all shall
be ended; whether for good or for evil.
HE only knows, to whom the secrets of
the heart are visible, even as the features
of the face. Farewell, be of good cheer,
and yet not over-cheerful.
CHAPTER IX.
Within
an hour after that most momentous
conversation, Annabel sat beside the
window
,
in that pleasant summer parlor,
looking
out on the fair prospect of mead and
dale and river, with its back-ground of
purple mountains; the very window from
which she had first looked upon De Vaux!
Perhaps a secret instinct had taught her
to select that spot, now that she was about
to renounce him for ever; but if it were
so, it was one of those indefinable
impulsive
instincts of which we are
unconscious
,
even while they prompt our
actions
.
De Vaux was summoned to her
presence
,
and Annabel awaited himarbiter
of her own and her sister's destinies!
Ernest, she said, as he entered,
cutting
across his eager and impetuous
inquiries
,
Ernest De Vaux, I have learned
to-day a secretshe spoke with perfect
ease, and without a symptom of irritation,
or anxiety, or sorrow, either in her voice
or manner; nor was she cold, or dignified,
or haughty. Her demeanor was not,
indeed
,
that of a fond maid towards her
accepted
suitor; nor had it the flutter which
marks the consciousness of
unacknowledged
love; a sister's to a dear brother's
would have resembled it more nearly
than, perhaps, anything to which it could
be compared, yet was not this altogether
similar. He looked up in her face with a
smile, and asked her at once,
What secret, dearest Annabel?
A secret, Ernest, she replied, which
I cannot but fancy you must have learned
before
, but which
you
certainly
have
learned
,
as well as I, to-day. My sister loves
you, Ernest.
The young man's face was crimson on
the instant, and he would have made some
reply, but his voice failed him, and, after
a moment of confused stuttering, he stood
before her in embarrassed silence; but she
went on at once, not noticing, apparently,
his consternation.
If you did know this, as I fear must
be the case, long, long ago! most basely
have you acted, and most cruelly to both
of us; for never! never! even if it had
been a rash, unsought, and unjustifiable
passion on her part, would I have wedded,
knowingly, the man who held my sister's
heart-strings!
It was, he answered, instantly, it
was a rash, unsought, and unjustifiable
passion on her part, believe me, oh!
believe
me, Annabel! that isthat is, he
continued, reddening again at feeling
himself
self-convicted, that is, if she felt any
passion.
Then you
did
know itthen you
did
know it, she interrupted him, without
paying any regard to his attempt at
self-correction
,
then you did know it from
the very firstoh! man, man! oh! false
heart of manoh! false tongue that can
speak thus of the woman whom he
loves!
yes, loves! she added, in a clear, high
voice, as thrilling as the alarm blast of a
silver trumpet, yes, loves, Ernest De
Vaux, with his whole heart and spirit!
Never think to deny it! did I not see
you, when you rushed to save her from
lesser peril, when you left me, as you
must have thought, to perishdid I not
see love written as clearly as words in a
book, on every feature of
your
face, even
as I heard love crying out aloud in every
accent of
her
voice?
What! jealous, Annabel? the calm and
self-controlling Annabel! can she be
jealous
of
her own sister, too?
Not jealous, sir, she answered, now
most contemptuously, not jealous, in the
least, I do assure you! For though, most
surely, love
can
exist without one touch
of jealousy, as surely cannot jealousy exist
where there is neither love, nor
admiration
,
nor esteem, nor so much as respect
existing.
How? do I hear you aright? he asked
somewhat sharply, do I understand you
aright? What have become, then, of your
vows and protestationsyour
protestations
of yester even?
You
do
hear meyou
do
understand
me, she replied, entirely rightentirely!
In my heartfor I have searched it very
deeplyin my heart there is not now one
feeling of love, or admiration, or esteem,
much less of respect for you; alas! that I
should say so! alas! for me and you!
alas! for one, more to be pitied
twenty-fold
than the other!
Annabel Hawkwood, you have never
loved me.
Ernest De Vaux, you never
have
known
never
will
knowbecause you are
incapable
of knowing the depth, the
singleness
,
the honesty of a true woman's love!
So deeply did I love you, that I have come
down hither, seeing that long before
you knew
me
, you had won Marian's
heartseeing that you loved her, as she
loves you most ardentlyand hoping that
you had not discovered her affection, nor
suspected your own feelings until to-day,
I came down hither, I say, with that
knowledge
,
in that hope, and I had found that
you had erred no further than in trivial
fickleness
,
she loving you all the while beyond
all things on earth, I purposed to resign
your hand to her, thus making both of you
happy, and trusting for my own
consolation
to consciousness of right and to the
love of
Him
, who, all praise be to Him
therefor, has so constituted the spirit of
Annabel Hawkwood, that when she
cannot
honor, she cannot afterwards for ever
feel either love or friendship You are
weighed, Ernest De Vaux, weighed in the
balance and found wanting! I leave you
now, sir, to prepare my sister to bear the
blow your baseness has inflicted. Our
marriage is broken off at once, now and
for ever! Lay all the blame on meon
me! if it so please you; but not one word
against my own or my sister's honor! My
aunt I shall inform instantly, that, for
sufficient reasons, our promised union will
not take place at all; the reasons I shall
lock up in my own bosom. You may
remain hereyou
must
do sothis one
night; to-morrow morning we will bid
you adieu for ever!
Be it so, he replied. Be it so, lady;
the fickleness I can forgive, but not the
scorn! I will go now, and order that the
regiment march hence forthwith. What
more recruits there he, can follow at their
leisure, and I will overtake the troops
before
noon, on the march, to-morrow;
and with the words he left the room,
apparently
as unconcerned as if he had not
left a breaking heart behind him, and as if
all the agonies of hell had not been
burning
within his own.
And was it true that Annabel no longer
loved him? True! oh! believe it not!
where woman once has fixed her soul's
affections, there they will dwell for ever;
principle may compel her to suppress
them; prudence may force her to conceal
them; the fiery sense of instantaneous
wrong may seem to quench them for a
moment; the bitterness of jealousy may
turn them into gall; but, like that Turkish
perfume, where love has once existed, it
must exist for ever, so long as one
fragment
of the earthly vessel which
contained
it survives the wreck of time and ruin.
She believed that she loved him not;
but she knew not herself; what woman
ever did? what man? when the
spring-tide
of passion was upon them? And she,
too, left the parlor, and within a few
minutes, Marian had heard her fate, and
after many a tear, and many a passionate
exclamation, she, too, apparently, was
satisfied of Ernest's worthlessness; oh!
misapplied and heartless term! She
satisfied
?
satisfied by the knowledge that her
heart's idol was an unclean thing, an evil
spirit, a false god! she
satisfied?
oh!
Heaven!
Around the hospitable board once more
once more they were assembled; but
oh! how sadly altered; the fiat had been
distinctly, audibly pronounced; and all
assembled there had heard it, though
none, except the sisters and De Vaux,
knew of the cause; none probably, but
they, suspected it. Well was it that there
were no young menno brothers with
high hearts and strong hands to maintain
or question. Well was it, that the only
relatives of those much-injured maidens,
the only friends, were superannuated men
of peacethe ministers of pardon, not of
vengeanceand weak, old helpless
women
!
There had been bloodshed else
and, as it was, among the serving men,
there were dark brows, and writhing lips,
and hands alert to grasp the hilt at a
word spoken, had they but been of rank
one grade higherhad they
dared
even as
they were, there had been bloodshed!
Cold, cold and cheerless was the
conversation
;
formal and dignified civilities, in
place of gay, familiar mirth; forced smiles
for hearty laughter; pale looks and dim
eyes, for the glad blushes of the promised
bridefor the bright sparkles of her eye!
The evening passedthe hour of
parting
came; and it was colder yet and
sadder
.
Ernest De Vaux, calm and inscrutable,
and seemingly unmoved, kissed the hands
of his lovely hostesses, and uttered his
adieu and thanks for all their kindness,
and hopes for their prosperity and
welfare
;
while the old clergymen looked on
with dark and angry brows, and their
help-mates
with difficulty could refrain from
loud and passionate invective. His lip
had a curl upon ita painful curl, half
sneer, as he bowed to the rest, and left
the parlor; but none observed that as he
did so, he spoke three or four words, in a
low whisper, so low that it reached
Marian's
ear alone, of all that stood around
him, yet of such import, that her color
came and went ten times within the
minute, and that she shook from head to
foot, and quivered like an aspen.
For two hours longer, the sisters sat
together
in Annabel's bedchamber, and wept
in one another's arms, and comforted each
other's sorrows, and little dreamed that
they should meet no more for years,
perchance
for ever.
CHAPTER X.
Three
hours had elapsed since all the
inhabitants
of Ingleborough Hall had retired
to their own chambers, and one, at least,
since Marian had retired from her sister's
dressing-room, to bed, but not to sleep.
During that weary hour, she had lain
tossing to and fro, feverish with anxiety
and expectation, irresolute, anxious, and
heartsick.
The last words which Ernest De Vaux
had whispered in her ear, unheard by any
others, contained a fervent entreaty,
perhaps
I
should say, rather, a command
that she should meet him after all the
house had gone to rest, in the garden.
And strange it was, that despite all
that had passed, despite all her own
good resolutions, all the resistance of
her native modesty, all her conviction
for she was almost convinced that he
was base and badshe yet lacked
firmness
to set the tempter at defiance.
It is a singular fact, but one which we
nevertheless encounter more frequently
than would be supposed, that it is women
of the most bold and free and fearless
characters, who, so long as their fancies
are untouched, appear the wildest and
the most untamable, that are subdued and
engrossed the most completely, when they
once become thoroughly enamored, when
they once meet with an overmastering
spirit.
And so it was with Marian Hawkwood;
high spirited and almost daring, while her
heart was free, no sooner had she fallen
desperately in love, as she did, with De
Vaux, than she became, so far as she was
concerned, the most thoroughly
subjugated
and tamed of beings. Her whole
nature
,
towards him at least, seemed to
have undergone a change. Her very
intellect
appeared to have lost much of its
brilliancy, of its rapid and clear
perceptions
,
as soon as he was to be judged.
To us, such things appear very strange,
although we see them happening before
our eyes almost daily. To us, they are as
inexplicable as the one half of our
motives
and our actions must appear
incomprehensible
to the other sex. But all these
diversities, all these inexplicable
contradictions
as they seem, in the nature and
characteristics of our race, have been
created
,
and unquestionably for wise ends,
by Him whose every deed is all wise,
whose every purpose perfect. And it
may well be that it is these very
differences
,
these very extremities of thought
and action, that render the two sexes so
eminently attractive to another.
To the mind of a man it naturally would
appear impossible, that after what had
passed, Marian should still entertain a
belief
,
a hope even, that De Vaux could
explain
honorably his most dishonorable
conductdishonorable, if possible, yet
more towards herself than towards
Annabel
.
It would seem that when he
presumed
to whisper in her ear that prayer
for a clandestine interview, she would
have recognised and spurued him for the
villain that he was. But it was not so
she still hopedif she did not believe
and if she made him no answer at the
time, it was that her maiden purity of
soul revolted from the idea of a
rendezvous
with any man at that untimely hour,
and in a place so sequestered.
At first, indeed, she resolved that she
would not meet him, and even made up
her mind to confide his request to
Annabel
,
as a fresh proof of his atrocious
baseness
.
But gradually worse thoughts and
more fatal wishes began to creep in, and
she suffered the long conversation
between
herself and Annabel to come to a
termination, without touching on the
circumstance
at all. At length she left her
sister's chamber, and withdrew to her
own, still without any fixed intention of
granting his request, but certainly
without
any fixed determination not to do so.
After she had undressed herself,
however
,
and that she did so was a proof that
up to this time her better principles had
the upper hand, she knelt down by her
bedside, buried her face in her hands, and
seemed, at least, to pray. It was,
however
,
but too evident that her mind was in
no state for prayer. She burst into a fit
of violent and convulsive weeping, mixed
with sobs almost hysterical, while strong
shudderings ran through her whole fair
frame.
No! she said, starting up after a
while, and calming herself by a powerful
effort of the willno, no, I cannot pray
it is mockerya shameful mockery to
bend my knees and move my lips in
prayer before the throne of God, when no
thought of him remains fixed in my mind
when by no effort can I concentrate my
wandering senses upon his goodness and
mercywhen by no effort can I banish
from my soul the recollection, the wild
yearning for the creature usurping thus
the place of the Creator! Oh, my God!
she continued, even more wildly than
before
my
God, what shall I dowhat
shall I do! what have I done that I should
be thus terribly afflicted! To bedto
bed! she added, extinguishing her taper,
as she spoketo bed, but not to sleep!
never to sleep again in peace or
dreamless
.
Would to God that this bed were
the gravethe cold unconscious grave!
And with the words, she laid her head
upon the pillow, and closed her eyelids,
saying to herself no, no, it were
unmaidenty
,
I will not think of itno, no! But
she did think of itnay, she could think
of nothing else; and ere long she unclosed
her eyes, and looked about her chamber
with a wild, eager glance, as if she were
in search of something which she expected
to see there, but saw not. Again she
closed them, and cast herself back
impatiently
upon the bed, and lay quiet for a
little while; but it was only by a great
effort
that she forced herself to do so, and
before long, she started up crying, I shall
go madI shall go madI hardly know
if I am not mad already. It is all fire
here! and she elasped her small white
hands over her brow, all raging and
consuming
fire! Air! air! I must have air
I am choking, stifling! Can it be that the
room is so suffocating hotor is it in my
own heart?
The comfortable, roomy chamber in
which she lay, could not have been more
pleasantly attempered to the weather and
the season, had it been regulated by the
thermometer. It was a large and airy
chamber, situated at the corner of the
house, so that its two large latticed
casements
looked out in different directions,
one over the little garden amphitheatre so
often noticed, the other down the broad
valley to the southward. The moon,
which now was nearly full, streamed in
at the eastern window, and would have
rendered the room nearly as bright as day,
if it had not been for the leafy head of one
of the huge sycamores that interrupted
the soft beams partially; and swaying
backward and forward in the west wind,
which was fitful and uncertain, now
blowing in long gusts, now lulling
altogether
,
cast huge and wavering shadows
over the floor and wallsso that they
were at one time all bathed in lustrous
light, and the next moment steeped in
misty shadows.
There was something in this wavering
effect of light and shade, that at first
caught the eye merely and attracted the
physical attention, if it is allowed so to
speak, and afterwards began to produce
an impression on her mind. It seemed to
her as if the vagueness and incertitude of
these fleeting shades were in some sort
assimilated to the wild and whirling
thoughts which were chasing one another
across the horizon of her own mind.
Then she compared them to the changes
and chances of mortal life, and thence,
as we are all so prone to do, when in
trouble and affliction, she began to charge
all her own misfortunes, and many of her
own faults, to the account of fortune.
If it had not been for the irresistible
destiny
which had compelled Ernest to
leave her at York, it could not have been,
she thought, that seeking her out so
eagerly
as he did on all occasions, and
admiring
her personal charms so evidently,
Ernest should not have ended by loving
and wooing her instead of her passionless
and gentle sister.
And from this train of thought she fell
into another yet more perilous. How,
she now asked herself, had it come to
pass that he had wooed Annabel at all
how, when he loved herself, should he
have sought her sister's loveor how,
loving her sister, should he have given
way, so clearly and openly as he had
done to-day, to a passion for herself.
His conduct did seem in truth
incomprehensible
perhaps
to himself, even, it
might have been sofor, I believe that,
far oftener than is generally believed,
men, if they were to subject themselves to
strict self-examination, would be at a loss
to account to themselves for the motives
whence arise very many of their actions.
This very strangeness of Ernest De
Vaux's demeanorthis very
impossibility
of accounting for his conduct on any
reasonable hypothesis, had the worst
possible
effect for her happiness, on the mind
of Marian. If she was to consider this
whole course of conduct infamous and
base, the baseness seemed too gratuitous,
the infamy too void of motive, to be
credited. And hence she was led to fancy
that there must be some unseen and secret
hand which had given motion to the
whole machinery, and which, could it but
be discovered, would probably afford a
ready clue and complete solution to all
that now appeared dark and enigmatical
in her lover's words and actions.
For whatever we find glaringly
inconsistent
,
or foolishly miscontrived in the
conduct of men, we are wont in our
blindness and conceitedness of heart to
consider enigmatical and obscure, as if,
forsooth, men were anything but masses
of inconsistencies the most glaring and
self-evident.
Having soon brought herself to the
conclusion
that because she could not
understand
the conduct of Ernest, there must
necessarily be something in it to be
understood
,
she now went to work to find
out what this something could be. The
original bane of woman, curiosity, was
busy in her secret soul, and soon there
came together two sister friends to aid her
in the invidious onslaught she was
seeking
on the strongholds of principle and
virtuefit partners in the foul alliance,
vain self-esteem, and jealousy.
First she commenced asking herself
how it could have been that he should
have failed to love her, and yet have
fallen in love instantly with Annabel
then she half doubted whether he had,
indeed, ever loved Annabel at allthat
he did so no longer was quite evident
and in the end she convinced herself, that
she had been the object of his love from
the beginning, that by some
misapprehension
of her manner he had been led to
believe her indifferent to himself, and that
in pique he had devoted himself to her
sister.
This train once kindled in her mind, the
flame ran rapidly from point to point, and
she was very soon so completely
self-deluded
,
that she gave herself up to the
conviction
that she was herself the only true
love of De Vaux, that his conduct had
been natural, and if very blamable, still
honorable, and deserving some
compassion
from the fact that her own charms
had been the cause of all the mischief.
Still she was very far from having made
up her mind to meet him, though she had
already admitted to herself that it was
cruel to condemn him without giving him
an opportunity of defending himself, and
one step leading to another, she soon
began
to consider seriously the possibility
of doing that, which but an hour before
she could not have contemplated without
terror and disgust.
Ere long it was fear only that dissuaded
her from goingthe fear of discovery, and
that was but a weak opponent to strong
and passionate lovefor she did love
Ernest De Vaux strongly and passionately
particularly when that love was, aided
and abetted by the other kindred spirits
of evil, which I have enumerated, and
which for ever lie hid in the secret
recesses
of the human heart waiting the
opportunity
to arise and do battle, when the
better principles are weakened by
temptations
,
and the tone of the mind soured
by vexation and rendered angry by
disappointment
.
Then she arose at length, half timidly
still, and half reluctantly. Nor did she
as yet admit to herself what was her
intention
as she dressed herself hastily, and
stole with a beating heart and noiseless
step to the door of her sister's chamber.
Opening it with a careful hand, she
entered
,
and stole silently to the bedside.
Pale as a lily, calm and tranquil lay sweet
Annabel, buried in deep, and as she at
first thought, dreamless sleep. One fair
slight hand was pressed upon her bosom,
the other arm was folded under the head
of the lovely sleeper. The broad light of
the moonbeams fell in a flood of pure
silvery
radiance over the lovely pictureand
surely never lovelier was devisedof
virgin
innocence, and purity of meekness.
For many moments the perturbed and
anxious Marian stood by the side of the
couch gazing upon the face of that once
beloved sisteralas! that I must say
once
belovedfor already had jealousy, and
distrust, and envy come over the heart of
the no less lovely watcherand she felt,
as she stood there, that she no longer
loved that sister, as she used to love, or
as she was still herself beloved. No
contrast
can be imagined more striking than
that between the sleeper, so still, so
tranquil
,
so sereneyet so inanimately pale
and spiritual in her aspectand the
flushed cheeks, and flashing eyes, and
frame quivering with wild excitement of
the half trembling, half guilty girl who
stood beside her. The deep regular calm
breathing of the sleeper, the short quick
panting inspirations of the excited
watcher
the
absolute unconsciousness of the
one and the terrible and overwrought
feelings of the otherthe innocence, the
confidence, the trust in God, of Annabel
the agonies, the wishes, and the doubts
of Marian.
And strange as it may seem, the very
peacefulness, the very absence of all
semblance
of earthly feeling or earthly
passion
in her slumbering sister, the infantile
repose which brooded over the candid
face, augmented Marian's feelings of
nascent
dislike or disaffection. An angry
sense of vexation that Annabel should be
able to sleep sound and quiet even amid
her griefs, while she could neither rest in
mind or body. Then she began to justify
herself in her own eyes by suffering her
mind to dwell on the idea that Annabel
could not be wronged by her, should she
consent to wed Ernest, for that her very
calmness and tranquillity must needs
betoken
the absence of true passion.
While she was wondering thus a slight
sound from the garden under the windows
caught her ear, and she started wildly,
her heart bounding as if it would have
burst out of her tortured bosom. A
shadow steals not across the moonlighted
landscape more noiselessly than did
Marian
Hawkwood glide over the carpet to
the lattice, and gaze down into the quiet
shrubbery. Alas! for Marianthere on
the gravel walk, half hidden by the
shadow
of the giant sycamores, stood the
graceful and courtly figure of the tempter.
His eyes were directed upward to the
casement at which she was standing
they met hersand on the instant, deeply
versed in all the hypocrisies of gallantry,
Ernest De Vaux knelt down, and clasped
his hands as if he were in prayer, and she
might see his lips tremble in the
moonlight
.
She turnedshe retrod the chamber
floor in silenceshe stood again beside
her sister's bedbut this time it was to
see only whether that sister's eyes were
sealed in oblivious slumber. As she
paused, she had an opportunity of judging
whether the dreams of that pale sleeper
were indeed so blissfulwhether the heart
of Annabel was so serene and passionless.
The moonbeams fell full on her face, as I
have said, and Marian saw two heavy
tears glide from her deeply curtained lids,
and slide down her transparent cheeks;
and while she gazed upon her she stirred,
and stretched out both her arms, as if to
clasp some one, and murmured in her
sleep the nameof Marian.
Had that small simple thing occurred
before the girl looked out and saw Ernest,
all might yet have been wellbut it was
all too latepassion was burning in her
every vein, and bounding in her every
pulseit was too late!she turned and
left the chamber.
Cautiously she stole to the staircase,
groping her way in the glimmering twilight
through the long oaken corridoras she
reached the stairhead she again paused,
listened, and trembleddid she hesitate?
Upon that landing-place there stood two
complete panoplies of steel, worn by some
loyal Hawkwood of old time in the wars
of the Roses, and as the eyes of the
excited
girl fell upon them, it appeared to her
that the spirits of her dead ancestors were
looking out from the bars of their
avantailles
reproachfully on their delinquent
daughter. Hastily she darted past them,
and flew down the stairs and reached the
vestibule, and there she met another
interruption
,
for a small favorite greyhound
her favoriteshe had reared it from a
puppy when its dam perishedwhich
was sleeping on the mat, rose up and
fawned upon her, and would not be
repulsed
,
but stood erect on its hinder legs
and laid its long paws on her arm, as she
thought afterward, imploringly, and uttered
a low ominous whine as she cast it off.
She unbolted the hall door, opened it,
glided out like a guilty spectre into the
glimpses of the moonand as she did so
a fleecy cloud passed over the pale face
of the planet, and a long wailing cry rose
plaintively upon the still night. It was
but the cry of an owlthere were
hundreds
of them in the woods around, and
she heard them hoot nightlyyet now she
shuddered at the sound as if it were a
warningand was it not so? The
smallest
things are instruments in the hands of
Him, to whom all earthly things
are
small.
CHAPTER XI.
Despite
the warning sounds, which at the
moment smote on her soul so ominously,
Marian went down the steps leading from
the little porch into the garden, although
her steps faltered, and her heart beat
violeutly
between fear and expectation, and
the consciousness that she was acting
wrongly. Before she had advanced,
however
,
ten paces, round the corner of the
hall, into the grove of sycamores, wherein
the shadows fell dark and heavy over the
gravel walk which rhreaded it, she was
joined by Ernest de Vaux.
He appeared, at the moment, to be little
less agitated than she was herself; his
countenance, even to the lips, was ashy
pale, and she could see that he trembled,
and it was owing, perhaps, to this very
visible embarrassment on his part, that
Marian felt less forcibly the extreme
impropriety
,
if not indelicacy, of her own
conduct.
Had he come to meet her, confident,
proud, and evidently exhilarated by the
success of his machinations, it is possible
that her modesty would have been
offended
;
that she would have discovered the
danger she was running, and withdrawn,
ere it was yet too late, for happiness or
honor.
But, as it was, when she saw the man
she loved, coming to meet her, wan and
agitated, timid, and with the trace of tears
on his pallid cheeks, a sense of pity rose
in her bosom, and lent its aid to the
pleadings
of that deceptive advocate within her
soul, which needed no assistance in his
favor.
Still, as she met him, there was an air
of dignity, and self-restraint, and maidenly
reserve about her, that went some little
way at least to screen her from the
consequences
of her exceeding indiscretion;
and when she addressed himfor it was
she who spoke the firstit was in a voice
far cooler, and more resolute, than the
mind which suggested and informed it.
I trustshe saidmy Lord de Vaux,
that you have good and sufficient cause
for the strange request which you made
me at our last interviewsome cause, I
mean, sir, that may justify
you
, in
requiring
a lady to meet you thus clandestinely,
and alone, and
her
in consenting to do so.
There has been so much strange and
mysterious
,
my lord, in your whole conduct
and demeanor, from the first to the last;
and that mysteryif not deceithas
wrought effects so baleful on my sister's
happiness, that I confess I have hoped
you may have something to communicate
that may, in some degree, palliate your
own motives, which now seem so evil;
and repair the positive evil which you
have done her. It is on this consideration
only, that I have consented to give you a
hearing. It is in this trust only, that I
have taken a step, which I fear me is
unmaidenly
and wrong in itselfbut it is by
my motives that my conduct must be
judged; and I know those to be honorable
and correct. Now, my lord, may it please
you to speak quickly that you have got to
saybut let me caution you, that I hear
no addresses, nor receive any pleadings,
meant for my own earone such word,
and I leave you. Speak, my lord!
You are considerate, ever, dear young
ladyreplied Ernest de Vaux, in tones of
deep respect, not drawing very near her,
nor offering to take her hand, nor
tendering
any of those customary familiarities,
which, though perfectly natural at any
other time, might, under present
circumstances
,
have had the effect of alarming
her, and checking her freedom of
demeanor
.
You are considerate, ever, dear young
lady! and I am bold to say it, your
confidence
is not misplaced, nor shall your
trust be deceived!
I do not knowanswered Marian
I do not know, my lord! It is for you
to show thatat present, appearances are
much against you; nor do I see what
explanation
you can make, that shall
exonerate
you. But to the point, my lord, to
the point!
None, Miss Hawkwoodnone! I have
no explanations that I can make which
shall exonerate
Then whyshe interrupted him,
warmly and energeticallywhy have
you brought me hither?or to what do
you expect that I shall listen?not,
methinks
!
to a traitor's love-tale?
Which shall exonerate me, I would
have saidDe Vaux resumed, as quickly
as she left off speakinghad you
permitted
me, from the grossest and most
blind follyhallucinationmadness!
Yes! I believe I have been mad.
Madness, my lord, exclaimed Marian,
is very apt to be the plea of some
people
for doing just whatsoever they think
fitwithout regard to principle or honor,
to the feelings of their fellow-creatures,
or to the good opinion of the world. I
trust it is not so with you; but I, for one,
have never seen aught in your conduct
that was incompatible with the most sound
and serious sanity.
I hardly know how I may speak to
you without offence, dear mistress Marian.
My object, in requesting you to hear a few
last words from a very wretched, and
very penitent man, arose from a painful
yearning to stand pardoned, if not
justified
,
in the eyes of one being at least, of
this family, to whom I owe so much, and
by whom I am now so grievously
misapprehended
.
Then I
was
right! answered Marian,
joyously, and her eye sparkled for a
moment
,
and her pale cheek flushed crimson
then you have some excuse to offer
well! my lord, well. It was in hopes of
hearing such, that I came hitherthere
can be no offence to me in thatI shall be
very glad to hear that one of whom I have
thought well, is worthy of such
estimation
.
But to prove that, he answered, in a
soft, low voice, I must enter upon a
history
;
I must speak to you of things that
passed long agoof things that passed at
York!
My lord! and she started back, a
brief spark of indignation gleaming in her
bright eyesmy lord!
Nay, he replied, humbly and sadly,
if you forbid me to speak, I am silent;
but by no means can I exculpate myself,
but by naming these things; and I
asseverate
to you by the earth, and the heavens,
and all that they contain!I swear to you,
by Him who made them all! that, if you
deign to hear me, I have a perfect and
complete defence against all but the
charge of folly. And, as you hope for
happiness yourself, here or hereafter, I do
conjure you hear me!
Your promises are very strong, my
lord; and your adjuration such, that I
may not refuse to listen to you.
I must speak to you of yourself,
lady!
Of myself?
Aye! of yourselffor you, Marian
Hawkwood, are the cause, the sole cause
of everything that has appeared
inconsistent
,
base, or guilty on my part!
I! my lordI!I the cause of your
inconsistency, your guilt, your baseness!
she cried, indignantly. Prove it, prove
itbut I defy youshe added, more
calmly, and with a scornful intonation of
voiceYou know that all this is words
wordsfalse and empty words! Now,
sir, speak out at once, or I leave you
better it were, perhaps, had I never come
at all!
Better, indeed! Alas! poor Marian, that
your own words should be so terribly
prophetic
,
that your one fault should have so
sealed and stamped your life with the
impression
of remorse and sorrow. For
3
Ernest de Vaux had now gained his end,
he had so stimulated and excited her
curiosity
,
and through her curiosity, her
interest
,
that she was now prepared, nay,
eager, to listen to words, which, a little
while before, she would have shrunk from
hearing. And he perceived the advantage
he had gainedfor all his seeming
agitation
and embarrassment were but
consummate
acting, and made himself ready
to profit by it to the utmost.
You cannot but remember, ladyhe
resumed, artfully, adopting the
unconcerned
tone of a mere narratorthe day
when I first saw you at the High Sheriff's
ball?
I do not know, my lord, what very
charming memories I have to fix the time
or place, upon my mind, of an event by
no means striking or delightful; was it at
the High Sheriff's ball?it might have
been, doubtless; for I was thereand if
you say it was, I do not doubt that you
are quite right.
But this affected unconcern, this little
stratagem of poor Marian, availed her
nothing
with De Vaux; for he saw through
it in a moment. He knew instinctively
and instantly, that it was affectedand
more, the affectation convinced him that
there was something that she would
conceal
;
and what that something was, his
consummate knowledge of the female
heart informed him readily. But he
replied
,
as if he was taken in by her artifice.
It is fortunate for you, he said, that
you can forget so easilywould to God
that I had been able to do likewisebut
if you have forgotten the time and the
place, I cannot believe that you have as
speedily forgotten the deep and evident
impression which your charms made upon
memy eagerness to gain your
acquaintance
my
constant and assiduous
attentions
in
short, the deep and ardent
passion
with which you had filled my very
soul, from the first hour of our meeting.
Indeed! she replied, very scornfully,
and coldly, you do far too much honor
to my penetration. I never once suspected
anything of the kind; nor do I even now
conjecture what motive can impel you to
feign, what, I believe, never had an
existence
in reality.
You must have been blind, indeed,
lady, as blind as I was myself. And yet
you cannot deny that my eye dwelt on
you; followed you everywherethat I
danced with you constantly, with you
alone
, and that when I danced not with you,
I waited ever nigh you, to catch one glance
from your eye, one murmur from your
sweet voice. You cannot but have
noticed
this!
And if I did, my lord?and if I did,
ladies of birth and station do not imagine
that every young man, who likes to dance
with them, and talk soft nonsense to them,
who perhaps thinks them pretty enough,
or witty enough, to while away a tedious
hour in the country, is in love with them,
any more than they wish gentlemen to
flatter themselves, that
they
have yielded
up their hearts, because they condescend
to be amused by lively conversation, or
even flattered by attentions, which they
receive as things of course!
And did you so receivedid you so
think of my attentions?
Upon my word, my lord, I don't
remember
that I thought anything at all
about them, that I perceived them even!
But your self-justification is taking a
strange turn. To what is all this tending,
I beseech you?
To this, Marian Hawkwood, that
when I saw you daily, nightly, at York, I
loved you with the whole passionate and
violent devotion of a free, honest heart
that I endeavored by all means in my
power, by the most eager and assiduous
devotion, by all those nameless
indescribable
attentions, which we are taught to
believe that women prize above all
things
Women are much obliged to you, my
lord, upon my word! she interrupted
him.
To let you perceive, he continued, as
if he had not heard her, to make you
understand how I adored you; and I
believed
that I had not been unsuccessful
I believed more, that you both saw, and
appreciated, and returned my love,
Marian
!
Did you, indeed? she replied, with a
bitter expression of haughtiness and scorn.
Did you, indeed, believe so? Then you
were, in the first place, very unhappily
mistaken; and, in the second place,
egregiously
misled by your vain self-conceit.
I believe
not
. Mistress Marian, ladies
are generally sufficiently clear-sighted in
matters that concern the heart, especially
when men endeavor to make those
matters
evident to them. I did so, and you
received my attentions with very evident
gratification. I do not now believe that
you are in the least a coquettethough I
did think so for a timebesides, I
know
that you love me now.
Love you, she replied, with a burst
of fiery indignation, nay! but I hate,
scorn, loathe, detest you! and she gave
way in a moment, to a paroxysm of
violent
and hysterical weeping; staggered
back to a garden chair; and sank into it;
and lay there with her head drooping
upon her breast, the big tears rolling down
her checks, heavy and fast as summer's
rain, and her heart throbbing and
bounding
as if it would break from her
bosom.
CHAPTER XII.
Ernest
de Vaux gazed on her for a moment
or two, with a well satisfied and
scrutinizing
eye, and then crept with a noiseless
foot to her side; knelt down on the turf at
her feet, before the paroxysm had, in any
wise, abated, and gained possession of
her hand, after a moment of faint and
ill-feigned
resistance.
Oh! my God! she exclaimed, what
does this mean, De Vaux?
It means, he answered, with a voice
admirably modulated to suit his object,
it means that I adore you, that I have
adored you ever, that, save you, I never
loved a woman.
How dare you? she replied, anger
again, for a moment, gaining the
ascendency
How
dare you mock me thus
and your addresses to my sisterwhat did
they mean, my lord?
Hear me, he said; however it may
please you to deny that you perceived my
attentions, that you remember where we
first met, you cannot, I think, have
forgotten
the morning, the accursed morning,
when I came to take leave of you before
setting forth to your father's house. That
morning, Marian, I came with an
ingenuous
heart upon my lips, a heart to cast
before
your feet, had you been willing to
receive it. But on that morning, I know
not wherefore, you were a different
creature
;
petulant, wilful, wild, repulsive; for
at this moment, I must speak the truth
you checked my speech, you jeered and
mocked at me, you spoke strange,
whirling
words against the truth, and honesty,
and honor of human kind at large, and of
men in particularyou said strange things
about your beautiful and charming sister;
till you convinced me quite, though, up to
that time, I had believed that you loved
me, that from the beginning you had
merely been coquetting with methat you
were a vain, heartless girl, eager for
admiration
only, and careless of the agonies
which your caprice occasioned.
Ernest De Vaux!
Marian Hawkwood!
You had no rightno causeno
shadow
of a reason so to surmise!
Pardon me, lady, your conduct left no
possible interpretation else. Even at this
moment, when I know that it was not
what I deemed it, I still am at a loss
utterly
to conceive your motives or your
meaning. You never hinted to me even
that your father was dead long ago,
though I spoke to you of visiting his
house. You called on me to promise that
I would never whisper to your family that
I had seen or known you. What could I
think? what do? I went my way
conceiving
myself a man scorned, slighted,
outraged in the tenderest and nicest point;
I went my way with a heart crushed, and
yet embitteredhumiliated, and yet
maddened
.
You had no right, I say it again; you
had no right to think so; you had never
spoken to me of lovenever so much as
hinted it; ladies do not believe that men
love them, because they are civil at a
morning visitattentive at an evening
ball. Oh! had you spoken to me; had
you spoken to me on that fatal morning,
Ernest De Vaux, all might
All might what, Marian, all might
what? he interrupted her, very eagerly.
All might have been understood
between
us, she replied, coldly, bridling her
impetuosity of speech.
But, Marian Hawkwood, he made
answer to her, if ladies do not believe
they are loved till they are told so in plain
words, neither will gentlemen, unless they
be consummate fools, speak those plain
words until, at least, they have some little
cause for believing that those words, when
spoken, will be acceptable. Now, on the
morning when I sought you, I fancied that
I had such causeand I did so believe
and I came to speak those plain words;
but by your own changed tone, and
altered
manner
True! true! she replied, at length, in
sad and faltering tones, quite overcome by
the intensity of her feelings; for, strange
to say, De Vaux had, perhaps, struck on
the only chord which would have at all
responded to his touch; certainly on that
which thrilled the most powerfully in her
soul. Had he, indeed, read her mind, had
he heard the thoughts expressed aloud,
which had been nourished secretly within
her for so long a time, he could not more
skilfully have ministered to her vanity,
have gratified her curiosity, have appeased
her wounded self-respect, have
re-awakened
her half dormant passion than he did
now by the course which he adopted.
True! true! she murmured, suffering
her head to fall upon her bosom in calm,
sad despondency, it is all truetoo true!
too true!
Her dream was then realized, she
thought within herself; it was as she had
fanciedhoped! He had loved her from
the beginning, and her only; it was her
own fault, and he! he the idol of her soul,
was guiltlessalas! how prompt are we
to deceive ourselves, when the deception
pampers our desires!
And why, he whispered in her ear,
tenderly, why was it so, Marian?
You have no right to ask me, sir; and
after all, your defence is faulty, is vain;
nothing worth! If you loved me, even if
I did misuse you, how does that palliate
your treason to my sister? for shame, my
lord, for shame! How dare you
challenge
me, or question my deeds, when
your own crime glares in the eye of
Heaven
!
You wrong
me
. Marian, and deceive
yourself; I am no traitor, nor have I ever,
wilfully, ever
at all
, wronged your sister.
There is, at all times, a reaction of the
heart after strong passion, checked and
cast back upon itself. Outraged and
wronged by one, it is natural, it is almost
a necessary consequence, that we fly for
consolation, for love to another. Pride,
toowounded and lacerated prideurges
us to win, where we have lost our all, in
the love of woman. And so it was with
me. To my own soul's deepest belief, in
my most holy and most sacred conscience.
I believed that I loved Annabel, as I had
never loved even you. The strange
similitude
,
blended with as strange
dissimilitude
,
between your styles of beauty,
between
your tones of thought, between
your characters of mind, yet more
enthralled
and enchained me. Then I
perceived
,
as I thought, that Annabel did love
me as trulyas you had sported with me
falselyand there, too was I mistaken!
and then for the sweetest drop, the most
powerful ingredient in the love philtre,
arose the thought that I should be avenged
on you, whom then I hated, as I had loved
you once, more than all womankind united.
I was happy, quiet, contented, conscious
of honoryes! Marian, I was happy! till
you returned; and at the first momentary
glance, the scales fell from my eyes, and
I saw that you loved me, the darkness
vanished from my heart, and I found that
I loved you yetas I had loved you
before
,
madlydevotedlyfor ever!
My God! my God! exclaimed the
wretched girl, wringing her hands in the
excess of mental anguish, what have I
done, that I should be so wretched?
Why, why should you be miserable?
replied the tempter; if it be true, as you
say it is, that you did not perceive or
suspect
my lovethat you have never cared
for methat you now hate me? Why,
Marian, why should you be miserable?
Ernest De Vaux, answered the
hapless
girl, raising her pale face, and fixing
her large azure eyes full on his features
Why trouble you me any further?
Between
you and me there is a great gulf
fixed. If you did love me, as you say,
and were prevented by any girlish fears
or girlish folly on my part, from speaking
your love honestlyif you did as you aver,
fall innocently into love for Annabel, and
awake from that fancied love again at
sight of mewhat does it avail me now
to hear this? Why do you tell it to me?
unless it be to make me utterly and
hopelessly
wretched, by contemplating the
happiness which might have been mine
once, but from which I am now debarred
for ever.
It may be yours yet, Marianif you
still deem it happiness to be minemy
ownmy own wife, Marian?
How, my lord, how? she asked with
a sort of cool and concentrated
indignation
.
How, without utter infamy? You
mistake the girl you address, my lord.
You little know the heart of Marian
Hawkwood
,
if you believe that she would break
a sister's heart, or lose her own good fame,
by wedding with her traitorous and
rejected
lover.
Marian
she
never loved me! Her
calm and placid temper, her equable and
quiet spirit, was not made for so violent
affections, so hot passions, as true love.
Even to-day
Hold! my lordhold; Marian almost
fiercely interrupted him,not a word
more; even to-day, you told that angel,
whom in your wickedness you dare to
slander, even to-day you told Annabel,
that if I felt
any
passion towards you, it
was a rash, unsought, and unjustifiable
passion! Those were your very words
your very words to-day, when she would
have resigned herself, and brought us
honorably wedded. Oh! man, to lie so
plansibly, and with so fair a grace, you
are but too forgetful. Begone, my lord,
begone! you stand self-convicted!
Marian, he replied solemnly, and
lifting his right hand up impressively to
Heaven. This is almost too painful, but
I cannot, no, I cannot permit innocence
such as yours to be thus played upon by
jealousy and envious selfishness; I swear
to you by the honor of my father, by my
mother's virtue, by
Him
who made, and
who now listens to us both! such words
as those never passed lip of minesuch
thoughts were never conceived in my
brain.
And it did not thunder:
Alas! that guilt is by no presage known!
The tempter voice hath of the truest tone.
You did
not
tell her thatyou did
not!
cried Marian, wildly, as she sprang to her
feet, deceive me not, I adjure you, as
you love me, as you hope for salvation!
deceive me not, now, Ernest de Vaux!
You did
not
tell her that?
As I hope for salvation, I did not! and
his voice did not falter, nor his cheek
blauch nor his lip quiver, as he swore, by
the holiest and the highest thing that shall
be, to that consummate lie! Nay, I
confessed
to her the whole truth; I told her
all, and all as I have told it now to you; I
conjured her to pardon any wrong I might
have most anintentionally wrought her
for she had told me before that, with a
mien and voice as firm as mine are now.
that from the moment when she knew my
love for you, she had ceased entirely to
regard
or love me: and I implored her to
reconcile us two, that together we might
yet be happy?
Can these things be? replied Marian,
gazing into his eyes as she would read his
soul. Oh! Ernest, Ernest, if you say
these words from the hope of winning me,
I do beseech von, I do adjure you once
more, on my knees, Ernest, dear, dear
Ernestunsay, unsay itdo not, for God's
sake, sow the seeds of distrust and
enmity
and hatred between two orphan sisters.
Oh! spare me, Ernest de Vaux, spare
me!
I would to God that I could! he
answered with the most perfect and
unmoved
hypocrisy, I would to God that
being so adjured, I dared unsay them
But for my sool, I dare not; what did she
tell you, Marian?
That you denied methat you
pronounced
my love for you, rash,
unsought
,
unjustifiable; can it be? God! God;
I shall go mad; can it be, Annabel, that
you so dealt with me'
And she came back to me, and told
me with calm air and pensive look, and
her eyes full of hypocritical tears, `that
you were so much set against me, that
you would not so much as hear methat
you had sent me a fierce, scomful,
passionate
message, which she would not do you
the wrong to deliver!
Oh! Annabel! Sister, sister Annabel!
Heaven is my judge, I would not so have
done by you to win an eternity of
blessings
!
And me, whispered De Vaux softly in
her ears, can you pardon me now, my
sweet Marian?
Nay! my Lord, I have naught to
pardon
;
we have both been deceived, first by
our own misconceptions, and then, alas!
alas! that it should be so! by my own
sister's treason. If there be any pardon to
be asked, it is I that should ask yours, De
Vanx.
It would be granted, ere it would be
asked, Marian, he replied, but now,
will you not hear me? will you not let me
pray you on
Oh! no no, Ernest, how can it be?
What, my God! what would you ask of
me?
To be mine, mine for evermy wife,
my own wife, Marian! And he glided
his haud around her waist, and drew her
to his bosom; and she no longer shunned
him, nor resisted, and their lips were
mingled
in a first kiss, as she sighed out that
irrevocable yes! Alas! for Marian!
But how? she whispered, as she
extricated
herself, blushing and trembling
from his arms, how can it be?
You must fly with me, ere dawn, my
love. I have a friend at Ripon, the
worthy
Dean, we can frame easily a tale to
win him to our purpose, who will unite us!
We will set forward presently, my horses
are equipped even nowyour palfrey shall
be made readyat the next village, we
can get some country maiden, who will
accompany you; at Ripon we shall
overtake
my brothers with the troops, and all
will go happily!
At first she refused positively, then
faintly
and more faintly, as that false, wily man
plied her with prayers and protestations
nay, tears even, and at lastoh! that we
should be so weak to resist deception,
when our own hearts conspire with the
deceiverat last, amid tears, and sobs,
and kisses, while saying I will ne'er
consent, consented.
CHAPTER XIII.
Stealthily
as Marian had descended the
staircase, to keep that fatal rendezvous,
more stealthily yet did she return. At
Annabel's door she again paused for a
moment; but she paused only now to
mark if she slept soundly; to hear if any
breath or movement betokened that she
was a wake to interrupt her. At first she
heard nothing, but by and by, as her ear
became more and more accustomed to the
silence of the house, and as the quick
beating of her own fluttering heart
subsided
into stillness, which for a time had
filled her ears with its tumultuous
murmur
,
she could distinguish, without
difficulty
,
the deep and regular breathing of
her slumbering sister as it became
distinctly
andible; and she was satisfied that
from her at least she was in no danger of
any interruption. Thence the unhappy
girl crept into her mother's chamber;
which, though it communicated with
Annabel's
by an open door, and though she
knew that the slightest noise in that
cherished
chamber was wont to arouse her
sister, she felt that she must visit, ere she
could quit the home of her fathers, as she
believed, for ever.
Oh! there is something indeed holy in
the atmosphere of a mother's chamber;
and that holiness fell, not like a soft and
gentle balm, but like a keen and acrid
irritant upon the wounded spirit of the
excited
maiden. There was something in
the whole aspect of the room unaltered
from her earliest childhoodin the
immovable
old-fashioned furniture, which
had survived in its quaint old age so many
owners, which had looked on so many
changes and chances; in the grim
cornices
and heavy scnlptured posts of the
huge canopied bedstead; in the strange
carvings of the vast oak mantelpiece, in
the rich dark hnes of the broacaded
hangings
;
in the tall cabinets of lacquered
Indian
ware; in the fantastic images
embossed
in gold upon their doors, at which
her childhood was used to shudder; in the
very ticking, slumberous and monotonous,
of the old eight day clock, by which she
was wont years ago to study her small
tasksthere was something in all this, I
say, that operated strangely, and very
painfully upon the mind of Marian
Hawkwood
.
She was embittered, angry, jealous
and yet more indignantheart-sick at
what she believed to be Anuabel's cruel
treacherythan angry, or jealous either
Her soul had drunk in, and received as
truth, all the base falsehoods of that false
and fickle lover. It was perhaps
impossible
,
after she had taken the first false
step of meeting him at all, that it should
be otherwiseand resolved as she was
that she would not permit the whole bliss
of her life to be frustrated by the
premeditated
baseness of another, she yet felt
and appreciated to the utmost, the whole
bitterness and agony of her position.
Her very heart was wrung by the idea
of quitting that loved home, that cherished
mother, those dear memories at alland
then to quite them, as she must,
clandestinely
,
in shame and darkness, and dis
honoroh! it was anguish! anguish
unspeakable
!
For a considerable time, Marian stood
motionless beside the bed of the paralytic
woman, happy for once, at least, in the
very thing which rendered her an object
of compassionhappy that she was
ignorant
of the sufferings and the trials, the
sins and the sorrows of her beloved
daughter
.
Wonderful, terrible contrast! the lovely
face of the young girl, in its wonted
aspect
so bright, so radiantly beautiful, now
pale alternately and flushed, harassed
and agitated, nay, almost distorted, and
showing in every line, every feature, the
prevalence of fierce and overmastering
passiou! And the calm, composed,
vacant
nay!
almost infantile expression of
the old woman's countenance! The one
in the very spring time of life, when all
should be innocence and peaceful mirth,
so full of unnatural and stormy tumults of
the soul! The other in extreme old age,
when the traces of long cares and many
sorrows are expected to be stamped
visibly
on the lineaments, so perfectly, so
deadly tranquil!
For many moments she stood there,
wistfully gazing on her mother's face, as
it showed paler even, and more wan and
death-like than its wont, in the faint
moonbeans; and, as she gazed, a milder
and less painful expression came over her
excited features; and her sweet, blue
eyes filled with tearsnot the fierce
scorching tears of passion, which seem
to sear rather than soothe the brain,
but the soft, gentle drops of
penitence
and moderated sorrow. She fell
upon her knees beside the bed, and
burying
her head in her hands, remained there
half reclined, her whole frame shuddering
from time to time, with a sharp and
convulsive
tremor, and the tears flowing so
abundantly that all the bed linen was
moistened by her weeping.
Whether she prayed, I know not
probably
not in words, nor in any fixed and
determined mood of humble supplication
but it would seem that she communed
with herself deeply, and called on heaven
to gaide and prosper her deliherations.
For she uprose after a little while with a
serener look and a quieter eye, and as she
rose, she said, in a whisperNo! I will
notI will not, and had already turned
to leave the chamber, when from the
inner
room, wherein Annabel was sleeping,
there came a rustle, a short, sudden sound,
which caused Marian to stop short and
listen, fearful that her sister was
awakening
,
All was still for two or three
seconds
,
and then the noise was repeated
more fondly than before, and
simultaneously
with the noise, several words were
uttered, with that peculiar intonation
which always characterizes the speech of
somhambulists. Marian listened as though
her soul was suspended on her sense of
hearing, yet, at first, she could distinguish
nothing. Annabel, however, ere long
spoke again, and the second time,
unhappily
,
her lips syllabled, but too distinetly,
the fatal name of Ernest.
The blood rushed to the brow of Marian
in a hot burning torrent, her eyes
lightened
with fiery angershe stamped her
small foot passionately upon the carpet,
and clinched her hand so tightly that
every nail left its visible point in the palm.
She ground her teeth together, and
muttered
through them
Ah! is it then soneverno! never
shall she have himnever! never!
never!
So slight a thing will at times suffice to
change our whole souls within usto set
our blood boilingto alter the whole tenor
of our actions, our livesto decide our
destinies in this world, perchance in the
world to come!
One moment, Marian stood resolved to
bear her sorrows boldly and noblyto
combat with the tempter, and be strong
to do her duty, let what might come of
it! The next, and the good resolve was
swept from her heart by the wild rush of
a thousand evil and bitter thoughts
anger
resentmentjealousyambition
pride! And whatwhat was the
puissant
spelt that had evoked these baneful
spiritsbaneful indeedfor fatal was
their cousequence to her, and to all those
that loved herthese chance words
spoken
by a disturbed and feverish sleeper!
Alas! she paused no more, nor looked
again on her scarce living mother, nor
gave heed to the memories which had
but now so nearly won her; but rushed
away with fleet and noiseless steps to her
own chamber, and then busily applied
herself to her brief preparations.
Brief indeed were the preparations
which she had the time or the disposition
to make, on that night!she dressed
herself
repidly, and almost mechanically, in a
dark riding dress and velvet cap, hurriedly
thrust a single change of raiment, and the
small casket which contained her few
simple jewels, into a light travelling bag
of scented cordovan leather, which had by
chance been left in her room when the
rest of her baggage was removed on her
return from York; and was, within a
quarter of an hour, prepared to set off on
fier untimely journey, whither she knew
not, nor when to return again!
While she was thus engaged, a little
incident
occurred, perhaps scarce worth
recording
;
yet so much wisdom may be
deduced oftentimes from observation of
the smallest and most seemingly trivial
incident, and so strongly did this, I think,
denote the extreme perturbation of her
mind, that I will not, trifling although be
it, leave it unmentioned.
While she was on her knees, busily
packing up her case, a beautiful
tortoiseshell
cat, a soft glossy creature, which
she had reared up from a little kitten, and
taught to follow her about like a dog,
jumped down out of a large arm-chair in
which it had been dozing and trotted
towards her with its tail erect, uttering a
small note of pleasure and affectionate
recognition
.
In a moment seeing itself
unnoticed
it laid its velvet paw upon the
arm of its young mistress with an
impatient
mewbut she, pre-occupied with
quick and burning thoughts, repulsed her
with so rude a hand, that she was thrown
off to a yard's distance, and stood gazing
as if in astonishment at so unkindly
treatment
from one who had always fondled
her and fed her. The very moment after
she had done this, as if repenting the
action
,
she caught up the little animal in her
arms, and burst into tears, as she kissed
and addressed it, as if it had been a human
creature.
Good bye, said she, good bye, poor
Pussy; I shall never see you any more;
you will be fed by other hands, you will
forget your poor mistress, Pussy. Yet
happier will you be than Ifor you
will not be driven from your pleasant
homeyou are not betrayed or deserted
by your friendsyou are not wronged by
those you lovefor you love no one
happy creature! love no one but her only
to whom you look for foodhappy,
happy
creature! and when she quits you, will
love equally the next hand that shall
fondle you!for you, thrice happy that
you are! you are not cursed with
memory
,
nor with affection, nor with passion
those agonies to which we are subject.
Then, for some minutes, she wept very
bitterly, still holding the cat in her arms,
purring with pleasure, and patting its fair
mistress's cheek with its velvet paws
until the distant sound of a horse's foot
upon the gravel road smote on her ear, a
summons to quit the home of her youth,
the friends of her childhoodand for
what? When she heard it, she raised her
head, and gazed about her wildly, as if to
collect her thoughts, lifted her eyes to
heaven, while her lips moved very rapidly
as if in inward prayer.
May God forgive me! she said, rising,
if this thing which I do is evil; and oh!
may he guard and guide my steps aright
and may he pardon those who have
driven me to this!
And then, without another word, she
laid her little favorite gently down on the
bed, and snatching up the leathern case
which she had made ready, she hurried
out of the room, not once casting her eyes
behind her, for she felt that if she did so
her resolution was at an end at once, and
stole down stairs, silent and trembling
between
fear and apprehension, and
something
near akin to remorse.
No sound this time came to appal her;
no obstacle occurred to interrupt her
progress
,
yet she shuddered as she stood on
the threshold of that once happy home,
and a quick ehillv spasm ran over her
whole frame, as if it were an ague fit.
Her fate, howeveror at least that which
men call fate, the stnbborn and determined
energy of her own erring passioncried
out within her, and nerved her body to do
that which she knew to be imprudent,
and almost knew to be wrong likewise.
She raised the latch of the front door,
and issued forth, closing it carefully
behind
her, and stood upon the stone steps,
gazing with a wistful eye over the calm
and tranquil scenery of that fair valley.
The antumn mora was already breaking
in the east, ere yet the moonlight had
faded
altogether from the skythe heavens
were pure and cloudless, and colorless as
a huge vault of crystal, except where on
the horizon a faint yellowish hue was
visible
,
first harbinger of the approaching
sun. There was not a breath of wind
astir; even on the topmost branches of
the tall trees about the hall, the sere
leaves, ready to flutter down at the
slightest breath, hung motioulesshere
and there a grey mist wreath soared up
ghostlike, in a straight column, from some
small pond or lakelet, and a light smoky
haze marked the whole course of the
Wharfe througt the lowlands; the frosted
dew lay silvery while over the lawn and
meadowsand not a sound or tone of
any kind except the continuous murmur
of the neighboring rivulet, swelling the
louder for the cessation of all other noises,
was to be heard through the sleeping
country. The earliest bird had not yet
left its roost, the very dogs were in their
heaviest slumber. And Marian, oppressed
as she was by sad thoughts and heavy
memories, felt that the silence was yet
more oppressivespoke more
reproachfully
to her conscience than the loudest
and most vehement rebukes. Those might
have called forth anger and awakened in
her heart the spirit of resistance; this, on
the contrary, appealed to her better
reason
,
and voiceless in its wholesome
admonition
,
led her to self-blame and
self-accusation
.
Had she stood many minutes there
aloue, with no other comrade than her
own restless and tormenting thoughts, it
is probable that she would have found
their burden intolerable, and have taken
refuge from them in a return to her duty;
but, alas! ere the re-action came, the
voice of the tempter again sounded in her
ear; and he, she loved so madly, stood
beside
her.
Sweet Marian, he murmured, gently
passing his arm round her slender waist,
why did you tarry so long? I almost
feared that something had occurred to
detain
youI fancied that your sister might
have awakened, and perhaps, have even
used force to prevent you. Come,
dearest
,
come, the horses are prepared and
await us by the hawthorn bush under the
hillock.
Was it chancewas it accursed and
premeditated art, that led De Vaux to utter
the one word that thrilled every chord of
her soul, that instantly attuned her to his
purpose, banishing every soft and tender
memory, and kindling jealousy and
distrust
,
and almost hatred, in that impulsive
soul, from which they had been gradually
fading, under the better influence of quiet
thought, aided by the tranquillizing and
harmonious sympathies of nature?
I know notbut she started as if a
serpeut
stung her, when the word sister fell
upon her ear; and though she had
almost
shrunk from De Vaux as he first
approached
,
with something more than the
mere timidity of maiden bashfulness, she
now gave him her hand quickly, and said,
in an eager, apprehensive voiceCome!
come!
He led her down the gentle slope to the
spot, where a single groom, an old,
grave-featured, grey-haired man, was
holding two horses, and her favorite
palfrey
.
He lifted her to her saddle, sprang
to his own, and, without another word,
they rode away, gently and heedfully,
till they had left the precincts of the park
behind them; but when they had once
gained the road, they fled at a rate that
would have almost defied pursuit, had
there been any to pursue them.
But there were nonenor was her flight
discovered until she had been gone above
two hours.
The morning broke, like that which had
preceded it, serene, and bright, and
lovely
;
the grent sun rushed up the blie vault
in triumphant splendor, all nature laughed
out in his glorybut at a later hour far
later than usual, no smoke was seen
curling
from the precinets of the hall, or sigu
of man or beast was visible about its
precincts
.
The passionate scenes, the wild
excitement of the preceding day, had
brought about, as usual, a deep re-action;
and sleep sat heavily on the eyelids, or
the souls of the inmates. The first who
awoke was AnnabelAnnabel, the
bereaved
and almost widowed bride.
CHAPTER XIV.
Dressing
herself in haste she sought, as
usual, her mother's chamber and found
her happyoh! how supremely happy in
her benighted state, since she knew not,
nor understood at all, the sorrows of those
whom she once had loved so tenderly
found her in a deep calm slumberkissed
her brow silently, and breathed a fond
prayer over her, then hurried thence to
Marian's chamber. The door stood open,
it was vacant! Down the stairs to the
gardenthe door that led to that sweet
spot was barred and boltedthe front
door stood upon the latch, and by that
Annabel passed out into the fresh young
morning. How fair, how peaceable, how
calm, was all around herhow utterly
unlike the strife, the trials, the cares, the
sorrows, the hot hatreds of the animated
worldhow utterly unlike the auxious
pains which were then gnawing at that
fair creature's heart strings!
She stood awhile, and gazed around,
and listened, but no sound met her ear.
except the oft-heard music of the wind
and waterexcept the well-known points
of that familiar scene; she walkedshe
rana fresh fear struck her, a fear of she
knew not whatshe flew to the garden
Marian! Marian!but no Marian
came! no voice made answer to her shrill
outcriesback! back! she hurried to the
house, but in her way she crossed the
road feading to the stablesthere were
fresh horsetracksseveral fresh
horse-tracks
one
which looked like the print of
Marian's palfrey!
Without a moment's hesitation, she
rushed into the stable court; no groom was
there, nor stable boy, nor helperand yet
the door stood open, and a loud tremulous
neighing, Annabel knew it instantly to be
the call of her own jennet, was
awakening
unanswered echoes. She stood a
moment
like a statue before she could
command
herself to cross the threshold.
She crossed it, and the stall where
Marian's
palfrey should have stood, next her
own, was vacant.
The chargers of De Vaux were gone;
the horses of his followersallall gone!
She shrieked alondshe shrieked, till
every pinnacle and turret of the old hall,
till every dell and headland of the hills,
sent back a yelling echo. It scarcely
seemed a second before the court-yard,
which, a moment since, was so silent and
deserted, was full of hurrying men and
frightened womenthe news was
instantly
abroad that Mistress Marian had
been spirited away by the false lord.
Horses were saddled instautly and
broad-swords
girded on, and men were
mounting
in hot haste, ere Aunabel had in so
much recovered from the shock as to
know what to order or adviseevil and
hasty counsels had been taken, but the
good vicar and the prebendary came
down in time to hinder them.
A hurried consultation was held in the
honse, and it was speedily determined,
that the two clergymen should set forth on
the instant, with a sufficient escort to
pursue, and if it should be possible, bring
back the fugitiveand although Annabel
at the first was in despair, fancying that
there could be no hope of her being
overtaken
,
yet was she some what reassured
on learning that De Vaux could not quit
his regiment, and that the slow route of
the troopers on a long march could easily
be caught up even by aged travellers.
The sun was scarce three hours high
when the pursuers startedall that day
long it lagged across the skyit set, and
was succeeded by night, longer still, and
still more drearyanother day! and yet
another! Oh the slow agony of waiting!
the torture of enumerating minutes!
each minute seemingly an agethe dull,
heart-sickening suspense of awaiting
tidingstidings which the heart tells us
the heart, too faithful prophet of the
future
cannot,
by possibility, be good!
While reason interposes her vain veto to
the heart's decision, and hope uplifts her
false and siren song!
The third night was at hand, and
Annabel
was sitting at the same windowhow
often it occurs, that one spot witnesses
the
dozen scenes most interesting, most
eventful to the same individual.
Is it, that consciousness of what has
passed, leads man to the spot marked by
one event, when he expects another? or
can it be indeed a destiny?
The third night was at hand, and
Annabel
was sitting at that same window,
when on the distant highway she heheld
her friends returning, but they rode
heavily
and sadly onward; nor was there any
flutter of female garbs among them.
Marian
was not among them! They came
the story was soon told!they had
succeeded in overtaking the regiment,
they had seen Ernest, and Marian was
his
wife!
The register of her marriage, duly
attested
,
had been shown to her uncle in the
church at Ripon, and though she had
refused
to see them, she had sent word that
she was well and happy, with many
messages
of love and cordiality to Annabel,
and promises that she would write at
short and frequent intervals.
No more was to be donenothing was
to be said at all. Men marvelled at De
Vaux, and envied him! Women blamed
Marian Hawkwood, and they, too,
envied
!
But Annabel said nothingbut
went about her daily duties, tending her
helpless mother, and answering her
endless
queries concerning Marian's absence,
and visiting her pensioners among the
village poor, seemingly cheerful and
contented
.
But her cheek constantly grew
paler, and her form thinner and less round.
The sword was hourly wearing out the
scabbard! The spirit was too mighty for
the vessel that contained it.
Five years passed thusfive wearisome
long yearsyears of domestic strife and
civil war, of bloodshed, conflagration, and
despair throughout all England. The
party of the king, superior at the first, was
waxing daily weaker, and was almost
lost. For the first years Marian
did
write,
and that, too, frequently and fondly, to
her sister; never alluding to the past, and
seldom to De Vaux, except to say that he
was all she wished him, and she more
happy than she hoped, or deserved to be
But gradually did the letters become less
frequent and more formal;
communications
were obstructed, and posts were
intercepted
,
and scarce, at last, did Annabel
hear twice in twelve months of her sister's
welfare. And when she did hear, the
correspondence had become cold and
lifeless
;
the tone of Marian, too, was altered,
the bnoyancy was gonethe mirththe
souland, though she complained not,
nor hinted that she was unhappy, yet
Annabel saw plainly that it was so. Saw
it, and sorrowed, and said nothing.
Thus time passed on, with all its tides
and chances, and the old paralytic invalid
was gathered to her fathers, and slept
beside
her husband in the yard of the same
humble church which had beheld their
union, and Annabel was more alone than
ever.
CHAPTER XV.
Five
years had elapsed since Marian had
fled from Ingleborough Hall, and, as I
have said already, Annabel knew but
little
what had passed with the cherished
sister since her flight. She knew, indeed,
that for the first years of her marriage she
was happy; and so joyously did she
sympathize
with that happiness, so sincerely
did her letters, whenever she had an
opportunity
of writing, express that
sympathy
,
unmixed with any touch of jealousy
or enviousness, that Marian could not long
resist the growth of the conviction,
strengthened at every renewal of the
correspondence
,
that Ernest had deceived
her, in the account by which he had
prevailed
on her to elope with him It is
not, perhaps, very strange, howeverfor
we cannot call anything strange with
propriety
that is of usual occurrencethat,
so long as Ernest de Vaux continued to be
the rapturous lover, and after that, the
gentle and assiduous husband, she felt no
resentment, nor indeed any inclination
to blame him for the deceit, which had
produced happy results only to herself,
and had resulted in no permanent
estrangement
or breach of confidence
between herself and Annabel. What
contributed
moreover, in no slight degree to
this placability on Marian's part, was that,
without ever actually confessing that he
had spoken falsely, De Vaux, as soon as
she was once irrevocably his, exerted
himself to palliate the conduct of Annabel,
representing it as a natural result of
galled and wounded feelings, as a lapse
to be pitied rather than blamed severely,
and effectually succeeded in
re-establishing
kind thoughts in her heart, and so
for poor Annabel never knew nor imagined
aught of Marian's causeless suspicion and
dislikebrought the sisters back to their
wonted footing of perfect familiarity and
untrammelled confidence.
Still, in despite of this, thought Marian
had nothing which she desired to conceal
from her sister, except what she believed
to be the solitary instance of deception in
her husbandwhich, though she excused
it to herself as a sort of pious fraud,
necessary
to ensure her happiness, she yet felt
as it were intnitively that Annabel could
neither regard in that light, nor ever
pardon
very readilythough Marian, I say,
had nothing except this which she desired
to conceal, and though her sister was the
very soul of frankness and ingenuous
truth, still any correspondence, even the
freest and most unreserved, is but a sorry
substitute for personal intercourse and
conversation, and can at best but convey
very slightly, an idea of the true state of
sentiments, emotions, and events,
especially
when they are protracted through
a long course of years.
Events, and the course of the earlier
part of the civil war, which was waged
for the most part in the southern and
midland
counties, had prevented the sisters
from meeting, Annabel remaining, during
the lifetime of her beloved mother,
assiduously
and earnestly devoted to her
comforts, while Marian, for the most part,
followed the court of the unhappy
Charles, who, still at Oxford or elsewhere,
kept up the semblance, at least, of his
kingly style, and held his parliament of
such peers as remained true to the cause
of their own order, of the church and the
crown.
Among all the bold cavaliers, who
fought and bled so generously for the
unhappy
king, the most unhappy and least
vicious of an unhappy vicious race, there
was not one more gallant, one who
achieved more glory than De Vaux.
Among all the fair dames, aristocrats of
nature, as of birth, who graced the halls
of declining royalty, there was not one
more lovely, more admired, or more
followed
,
than the bright and still happy
Marian. Delighted by the fame and
honors which daily fell more thickly on
her husband, amused, pleased, and
dazzled by the novelty of her position, for
a considerable time Marian believed
herself
perfectly happy, as she believed
herself
also to be devotedly beloved by her
husband.
The very hurry and turmoil in the midst
of which she necessarily lived, was not
without its wild and half pleasurable
excitement
after
custom and experience,
and the seeing him return home victorious
and unwounded, had steeled her against
the terrors and the anguish which assailed
her at first, whenever he rode forth to bat
there was a sort of charm in the short
absences, from which he ever hurried
home, as it appeared more fond and more
enamored than in the first days of her
wedded life. This hurry and turmoil,
moreover, afforded to De Vaux constant
and plausible excuses by which to
account
for and mask his irregularities,
which became in truth more and more
frequent, as the fresh character and
lovely
person of his wife gradually palled on
him by possession. For in truth he was a
wild, reckless, fickle mannot by any
means all evil, or without many generous
and gentle impulses, although these had
been growing daily weaker and less
frequent
through a life of self-indulgence and
voluptuousness, till very little was now
left of his original promise, save courtly
manners, a fair exterior, andsimply to
do him justicea courage as indomitable,
cool, and sustained, as it was vigorous
and fiery.
He lived in a period of much license
he was the eldest son of a doating father
he had lost his mother, while he was
yet a mere boyall three vast
disadvantages
vast
misfortunes to a young man.
Indulged to the utmost of his wild and
fantastic wishes by his father, encouraged
rather than checked in those
extravagances
which the cavaliers of the day
affected somewhat, in order to mask their
detestation of the cold-blooded hypocrisy
and ridiculously insincere profession of
those most odious impostors who
constituted
the vast majority of the Puritanic
leaderslaunched very young into the
world, with handsome person, courtly
manners, high rank, and almost boundless
wealth, his success with the women of
the court, in an age the most licentious
England had then witnessed, was wide
and unbounded.
He had already become the most
hardened
being in the world, a cool
voluptuary
,
a sensual, luxurious, calculating
courtier, when he met Marian at the
Sheriff's
ball, at York, and was struck
instantly
by her extraordinary beauty.
Having approached her in consequence
of this admiration, tired as he was, and
sick of the hackneyed and artificial
characters
,
the affectations, and
minauderies
,
and want of heart of all the women with
whom he had as yet been familiar, he
was soon yet more captivated by the
freshness of her soul, the artlessness of her
manner, the frank, ingennous, off-handed
simplicity of her bright, innocent youth,
fearless of wrong, and unsuspicious of
evil, than he had been by her beauty.
So that before he was compelled by
paramount
dutythe only duty which he
owned, military duty namelyto quit
York, he was as much in love as his evil
course of life and acquired habits had left
him the power of being, with the sweet
country maiden. That is to sayhe had
determined that the possession of her was
actually necessary to his existence, and a
thing to be acquired on any termsnay!
he had even thought many times, that
she might be endurable for a much longer
period than any of his former loves, and
begun to fancy, that, when his passion
should have settled down into esteem, he
might be able to tolerate in Maria
Hawkwood
,
the character he dreaded most in
the world, that of a lawful wife.
There was something in the whole air
and demeanor of Marian Hawkwood, that
told the young debauchee, almost
instinctively
,
that there was but one name in
which she could be addresseda purity
and innocence of heart and manner,
likewise
,
which would have prevented the
most dissolute and daring of mankind
from dreaming even of approaching her
with dishonorable addresses. Now, it
was difficult for a man of De Vaux's
character
and principlesif that can be called
principle which is rather a total absence
of all principleaccustomed to doubt and
disbelieve and to sneer at the possibility
of female virtue, to bring himself to the
resolution of deliberately offering his
hand to any woman, how passionately he
might be attached to her soever; and this
difficulty of making up his own mind it
was, and not any timidity or bashfulness
things utterly strange and unknown to
his hard and worldly naturewhich
caused
that irresolution which had given
offence
so deep to Maria Hawkwood.
It cannot be denied that her manner on
that interview did pique and provoke him
beyond measurethat it threw him into
doubt as to the question whether she did
indeed love him or not, and by
awakening
for a moment an idea of the possibility
of his being rejectedan idea which had
never so much as occurred to him before,
even casually, materially increased his
dislike to subsiding into a tranquil and
domestic Benedict.
These were the real reasons for his
seemingly extraordinary conduct towards
Marian in the first place; and not at all
that which he had stated, for he had been
indeed falsefalse from the beginning.
It was then in a singular state of mind,
vexed with himself and irritated at finding
himself subject to a passion seemingly
hopeless, annoyed that he was unable to
shake off that passion lightly, indignant
with Marian for not appreciating
sufficiently
the honor he had done her, in so
much as thinking of making her his wife,
foiled, furious, discontented, and devoured
all the time by the agony of his fierce
desire
for
it is mere profanation to call that
which he felt, lovehe set forth from York
to visit, as he imagined, the father of his
cruel fair one.
Many wild schemes and projects flitted
through his mind as he journeyed
westward
,
which it were neither profitable nor
pleasing to follow out; but each and all
of these had reference to winning Marian
in some shape or other, and at some
period
not remote.
What occurred when he reached
Ingleborough
,
is known already to those who
have thus far followed the fortunes of
the sisters; but what in truth passed in
the recesses of his own heart has never
been divulged, nor can be known to any
one. It may be that pique and anger at
Marian's manner when they parted had
really disposed him, as he said, to love
another honestly and truly; it may be
that the exquisite repose and charming
sweetness of Annabel did indeed win upon
his soul, and work for the time a partial
reformationbut what alone is certain is,
that he felt more of that repugnance to
sacrificing what he called his liberty,
which had actuated him with regard to
Marian, when he proposed to Annabel.
It may be, on the other handand it
would be by no means inconsistent either
with his past character or after conduct
that frokle and light as he was, and very
liable to be captivated for the moment by
the charms of women, that, I say, he was
influenced by a twofold motivetwofold
and doubly baseof gratifying a passing
caprice in marrying Annabel, and
inflicting
the heaviest punishment he could
imagine on her sister at the same time.
It is probable, even, that he might have had
baser and more infamous projects in view,
with respect to poor Marian; and it is
certain that he looked to the disturbed and
perilous state of the country, as to a
favorable
position of things to his purpose,
should he desire to abandon his fair young
wife, after a timeseeing that she had no
influential relations to protect her, and
that if peace should be restored at last, little
inquiry was likely to be made after affairs
of mere personal consideration.
Frustrated in his intentions by the
return
of Marian, and by her inability to
conceal the violence of the hopeless love
which she still nourished for her sister's
wooer, although she nourished it without
one thought of evil entering her pure
spirit, having betrayed moreover his own
maddening passion, which returned upon
him with redoubled violence, when he
was thrown again into her society, he
could not endure the scorn, the contempt,
which he felt gathering around him, nor
bear the publicity of his disappointment.
It was the fear of this publicity, then,
and the determination that he would,
under no circumstances, leave
Ingleborough
in the character of a rejected and
disappointed suitor, that induced him to
renew his solicitations to poor Marian.
Shrewd and keen sighted, and able judge
of character as he was, he readily
perceived
that in the calm and composed
soul of Annabel Hawkwood, there was a
deep settled principle, a firm and resolute
will, a determination capable of calling
forth any powers, whether it were to do
or endure. It required, therefore, little
reflection
to show him that with her he had
now no possibility of succeedingthat
once detected, as he felt himself to be, his
whole mind and motives perused and
understood
as if they had been written out
in a fair book for her inspection, the very
love which she had entertained for him
in the past, would but the more strongly
arm her against him in the present
Nor was this allfor even his effrontery
was at fault, even his natural audacity
shrank from encountering the tranquil
scorn, the quiet and unutterable loathing
which he saw visible in every glance of
her mild eye. Ere long, between the
sense that he had irreparahly injured her,
and the knowledge that she understood
him thoroughly, he came to hate her with
a vehement and bitter hatred.
In this hatred, too, he found a new
instigation
to persevere in his attempts on
Marian, for he was certain that, although
the ordinary sources of annoyance, envy
or jealousy, could never inflict a single
sting on Annabel, he could wreak no
heavier vengeance on her than by making
her beloved sister his wifethe wife of a
man whom she despised so utterlyand
he acknowledged it in his own secret
soulso worthily.
Unhappily, in the impulsive and
impetuous
character of Marian, which he had
studied to its inmost depths, he
encountered
no such resistance as he knew he
should encounter from her sister.
Falsehoods
which would have been discovered
instantly and rejected with scarce a
consideration
,
by the quiet thoughtfulness and
innocent penetration of the elder sister,
wakened suspicions in the quicker mind
of the younger, galled her to the very
quick, dwelt in her heart, filling it with
bitterness and gall, and at last ripened into
terrible and dark convictions of the
unworthiness
of her who was, in truth, the
best of sisters, and the tenderest of friends.
These were the motivesthese the
means of Ernest De Vauxand we have
seen, alas! how fully they succeeded.
What are the necessary consequences
of a marriage contracted with such views
as these, founded upon a man's caprice
for a woman whom he would have made
his mistress if he could, and only made
his wife because he could by no other
means possess her, cannot be doubted.
Nothing at first could be happier than
Marian Hawkwood  for she mistook,
naturally enough, the fierce and violent
passion of her young husband for genuine
and veritable love; and, indeed, after
saticty and possession had long dulled the
ardor of this passion, circumstances for a
long time conspired to keep up the illusion
in the mind of Marian. The hurried and
changeful life which they led; the very
large portion of their time which was
passed, to a certain degree, in public; the
gratified vanity of her husband at the
admiration
which she excited everwhere,
and which delighted his vain and fickle
temperament long after he had ceased
himself to care for her, all tended to delay
the fatal discovery, which it was clear
that she must one day make, that she was
loved no longer.
At first, as she perceived that his
attentions
were declining, that he no longer
hurried homeward with eager haste, his
duty in the camp or in the court
accomplished
,
that the revel or the dice detained
him, she threw the blame on the unsettled
times, on the demoralizing influence of
civil warfare, and wild company, and the
want of a permanent and happy home.
She prayed, and believed that with the
war these things, which were converting
fast her life into one scene of sorrow,
would come to an end, and that shortly.
But neither did the war, nor the sorrows
which she attributed to that war, seem
likely to be brought to any speedy or
even favorable termination.
No children had blessed that ill-fated
union, and Marian, when she did not, in
obedience to the order of her husband, go
into the court gaieties, such as they were
at that time, was almost entirely alone.
Alone she brooded in despondency,
almost in despair, over her hapless present
life, and almost hopeless future. Write to
her sister of her griefs she could not;
where was the use of torturing that worn
heart with other sorrows, when she must
needs have enough sorrow of her own.
Abroad she was subject to the twofold
agony of witnessing the bold and open
faithlessness of her husband, his infamous
addresses to the wild and licentious
beauties
,
made, perhaps, wild and licentious
by the extravagance of their natural
protectors
,
and the strange and corrupting
circumstances of the timesand of
enduring
the base solicitations and addresses
of the gay friends of her husband
solicitations
and addresses which she could
scarce believe were unknown to him,
who, most of all men, should have
resented
and avenged them.
Thus year by year dragged on, until
Marian, thoroughly convinced of her
husband's
infidelity and baseness, which,
indeed, he scarce now affected to conceal,
was the most miserable of her sex.
All her high spirits had taken to
themselves
wings, and flown awayall her
wild daring elasticity of character
tameless
gaiety, which was so beautiful of old
her strong impulsive franknesswere
broken, gone, obliterated. She had
become
a quiet, sad, heart-broken,
meditative
creature Yet she repined not ever
nor approached himnor gave way to
sadness in his presencebut strove, poor
wretch, to put on a semblance of the
manners which he had once seemed to
love, and her pale lips still wore a sickly
smile as he drew near, and a wild
cheerfulness
would animate her for a moment;
if, by chance, he spoke kindly, a hope
would arise within her that he might still
be reclaimed to the ways of virtue and of
love.
But still the hope was deferred, and her
heart grew sick, and utter gloom took
possession of her; so that she now looked
forward to no other termination of her
sorrows than the grave; and to that she
indeed looked forward, at what time it
should seem good to Him to send it, who
orders all things, and all wisely.
CHAPTER XVI.
Thus
then had the days passed with
Marian during those years of which her
sister knew so little, each day sadder and
bearing less of hope than the last. She
had heard of her mother's death, that
mother
whom she had once so cherished,
whose memory was still so dear to her
yet had those gloomy tidings brought no
increase to the unhappy wife's cold
sadness
.
No! so completely had the harden
ing touch of despair petrified all her
feelings
,
that she now felt that nothing could
increase or diminish the burden under
which she labored. If she thought of the
dead at all, it was to envy, not weepit
was to clasp her hands, and turn her eyes
up to heaven, and to cryBlessed are
the dead, who die in the Lord; even so
saith the Spirit; for they rest from their
labors
!
And worse every day, and more
viciousaye! and more loathsome and
more cruel in his vices, did Ernest de
Vaux show himself. Alas!the career of
vice is as it were on a road up a steep
mountain's side. There is no halting on
the way, no standing stillno power of
remaining where you are. Upward or
downward, you must on, and on for ever!
Upward with conscientious hopes and
earnest struggles and energetical resolves
to virtue, and to honor, and to peaceor
downward, with headlong speed, to crime,
and agony, and ruin, and that perdition
which shall not end when all things else
have reached their termination. Alas! I
sayalas! for this latter was the path in
which the steps of De Vaux were
hurrying
,
and towards this termination.
From gentlemanly vice, as it is falsely
called, and those extravagances or
excesses
rather, of which men, deemed by the
world honorable, may be guilty without
losing caste, Ernest began now to
degenerate
into low profligacy, vulgar habitual
debauchery! His noble features and fine
form had already begun to display the
symptoms of habitual intemperance; his
courtly manners and air once so noble
had deteriorated sadly; his temper, so
equable and mild, and at the least in
outward
show so kindly, had become harsh,
and quernlous, uneven, and at times
violent
and brutal.
Yet Marian still clung to him, faithful in
weal and woe, in wealth as in poverty
for at times, in the changes and chances
of the civil war, they had in truth
undergone
much hardshipshe was still the
unchanged, unrepining, fond consoler
but alas! how cruelly, and how often
were her sweet consolations cast back
upon her, her kind and affectionate
advances
met with harsh words, and bitter
menacesand once! yes, once, when the
mad demon of intoxication was all
powerful
within himyes! once with a blow.
It was the fifth year of the civil war,
and though many fierce and sanguinary
fields had been fought, many towns taken,
many halls and manor-houses stormed
and defended, much generous, noble blood
prodigally wasted, neither side yet had
gained anything of real or permanent
advantage
.
It was the fifth year of the civil
war, and the Marquis of Newcastle, one
of the most accomplished and gallant
noblemen
of the day, was holding York for
the King, though besieged with an
over-whelming
force, by the united forces of
the English puritans and independents,
under Lord Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell,
and the Scotch covenanters, under David
Leslie, and many of the Protestant Lords
of the sister kingdom.
The siege had indeed lasted some time,
but although those within the city were
beginning to look eagerly for the relief
which was expected daily from Prince
Rupert, they were not as yet straitened
for provision, or dispirited. And here in
the midst of present apprehension, and
perhaps soon to be in the midst of peril,
here in the very city, wherein she had
passed those few bright days, the
brightest
and the happiest of her life, alas! that
they should have led to consequences so
cruelly disastroushere in a poor mean
lodging in a small narrow street, nigh
Stonegate, dwelt the once bright and
happy Marian.
It was night, and although summer
time, the air was exceeding damp and
chilling
.
It was night, dead might, and quite
dark, for there was no moon, and the
skies were so cloudy that the faint
glimmer
of the stars failed to pierce their
thick folds. There were no sounds abroad
in the beleagnered city but the distant call
from hour to hour of the answered
sentinel
,
and the occasional tramp and clash
of arms, as the grand rounds passed
through the streets to visit the outposts,
or the relief parties marched toward the
walls.
At this dead hour of the night, in a
small wretched parlor scantily furnished
with a few common wooden chairs, a
coarse oak table on which stood a brazen
lamp diffusing a pale uncertain light
through the low roofed apartment, and
sufficing barely to show the extreme
poverty
and extreme cleanliness of that
abode of high born beauty, sat Marian,
Lady de Vaux, plainly attired, and in no
wise becomingly to her high station, pale,
wan, and thin, and careworn, and no
more like to the Marian Hawkwood of old
days than the poor disembodied ghost to
the fair form it once inhabited.
The floor of the wretched room was
neatly sanded, for it was carpetless, and
no curtains veiled the small latticed
casements
the
walls were hung with
defensive
armor and a few weapons, two or
three cloaks and feathered hats, disposed
with a sad attempt at symmetrical arrange
ment and decorationfour or five books
some paper and materials for writing, and
an old lute lay on the table by which
Marian was sitting, and on another smalle
board at a little distance, neatly arranged
with a clean white cloth, stood a loaf of
bread, the remnants, now very low
reduced
,
of a sirloin, and a half bottle of red
winethe supper prepared by the haples
wife, herself fasting and hungered, for the
base recreant husband.
An open Bible lay before Marian on the
board, but though her eyes rested on the
blessed promises, and her hands at times
as if mechanically turned its pages, her
mind was far away, suspended on every
distant sound that rose from the deserted
streets, starting at every passing footstep
with a strange mixture as it seemed of
eager expectation and wild fear.
At length a quick, strong, heavy tread
came up the street, and paused under the
window.
It is he, she said, listening intently
with a deep crimson flush rising to her
whole face, but receding rapidly, and
leaving only two round hectic spots high
up on her cheek bones. Thank God
it is he at last! and she arose and
trimmed
the lamp, and drew the little table
forward with the preparation for his
supper
but,
as the door below yielded to the
pass-key which he carried, she started and
turned white as ashes; for the sound of a
second step reached her ears, and the soft
cadence of a female voice. She paused,
with her whole soul intent upon the
sound, and as they came nearer and nearer,
and more and more distinct
My God! she said to herself, in a low
choked whisper clasping her hands
together
,
as if in mortal anguish, my God!
it cannot be!
But it wasit was, as she dreaded, as
she would not believe! Shame on the
dastard villain! it was true!
The door opened suddenly, and Ernest
de Vaux entered, with a tall and
exceedingly
handsome woman leaning upon his
arm, whom Marian recognished the very
moment their eyes met, for the Lady Agnes
Trevor, of whose bold and shameless
conduct with her husband she had long
heard, though she strove to close her ears
to them, a thousand cruel rumors. This
last worst outrage, however, was not
without its effect; even the worm, when
trodden under foot, will, it is said, rise up
against its torturer; and even her base
husband was astonished at the superb and
stately majesty with which the wronged
and heart-broken woman drew herself up,
as they entered, at the flash of grand
indignation
which lightened from every
speaking feature; if he had calculated
that her spirit was so utterly cowed and
broken, that she would endure everything
in silence, madly had he erred, and
tremendously
was he now undeceived.
Even the guilty woman who
accompanied
him, started back in dismay; it
would appear even that she had not
known before whither he was conducting
her, for she shrank back aghast, and clung
to his arm yet closer than before, as she
asked in a tremulous and agitated tone,
Who is this, who is this lady? Ernest!
It is his wife, madame! replied
Marian
,
taking a forward step; his wedded
wife, for whom it is rather to ask, who you
are, that intrude thus upon her, at this
untimely hour?
It is my wife, Agnes, answered De
Vaux at the same moment; my wife,
who will be happy to extend her
hospitality
to you, until these most unhappy jars
are ended, and you reconciled to my lord;
Marian, it is the Lady Agnes Trevor, who
asks your welcome; assure her
I do assure her replied Marian,
haughtily; that she is perfectly, fully
welcome to enjoy all the comforts, all the
hospitalities which this roof has to offer
this roof
Why, that is well, replied her
husband
,
with a sneering smile, I told you,
Agnes, she would be very glad to receive
you, she is a sweet, mild, patient little
creature, this pretty wife of mine!
This roof, continued Marian, which,
from this hour, shall never cover my head
any more.
Heyday! heyday! what is all this?
what does this mean
It means, simply, that hitherto I have
borne much, have borne allbut infamy,
and infamy I will bear never.
Fare-you-well
,
sir; may you repent, I saymay
you repent, I say, and ere it be too late,
and may you, she added, turning to the
frail beauty, who trembled in her
presence
,
may you never know the agonies
which you have heaped upon my soul?
And she passed by them, with a
movement
so impetuously rapid, that she was
out of the door before Ernest, to whom
Agnes Trevor was clinging still in mortal
terror, could interpose to arrest her flight
But recovering himself, instantly he darted
after and caught her by her dress, and
would have dragged her back into the
room, but she laid hold of the balustrades
of the staircase, and clung to them so
strongly, that he could not move her.
Do you so little know me, Marian,
he exclaimed furiously, as to imagine
that I would suffer my wife to go forth
alone, a mark for evil tongues, at such an
hour as thisback! Madam Marian
back to your chamber, or you will force
me to do that I shall be sorry for!
Sorry for! answered Marian, with
calm scorn, you sorry for aught of
injury
to me! and do you, sir, so little know
me as to imagine that I would stay one
moment under the same roof with your
With my whatwith my what,
madam
?
shouted De Vaux, beware how
you answer!
Unhand me, sir, unhand me! she
replied
,
unhand me; for I will go forth!
Answer mewith my what? under
the same roof with my what? he again
exclaimed, shaking her violently by the
arm.
With your harlots, sir, she replied,
firmly, and at the same moment two
fearful
sounds followed her words; one the
most fearful sound, perhaps, that can be
heard on earth at all; the sound of a heavy
blow dealt by a man to a weak woman;
the other a wild, piercing female yella
yell that echoed far and wide through the
midnight city. But it came not, that
awful
shriek, from the lips of Marian.
No, no; it was the reckless, the
abandoned
outcast wife of the Lord Albert
Trevor
,
that uttered the heart-rending cry, as
she rushed, with a frantic air, out of the
chamber, and throwing herself at the feet
of her seducer, and clasping his knees
wildly with one hand, caught with the
other his upraised right armupraised
again to smite her whom he had sworn to
love and honor.
Me, me! she cried, oh, Godme!
me! not herstrike mestrike me, not
her! for I deserve itdeserve it allall
allme, as she rightly termed me; me,
the outcastthe harlot!
And with so powerful a grasp, moved
by the ecstasy of remorse and frenzy, did
the frail creature restrain the ruffian's fury,
that he was forced to stoop down and
exert some power to remove her. But
the moment Marian perceived what was
passing, she darted down the stairs, and
through the front door, which she closed
violently behind her, and into the vacant
street, and fled with a speed that soon set
pursuit at defiance. That night she slept
at her old uncle's house in the Minster
yard, the following day York was relieved,
and the siege of the Puritans raised by the
fiery Rupert. On the third morning the royal
troops sallied forth to give battle to the troops
of Fairfax upon the fatal Moor of Long
Marston
,
and while the roar of cannon was
deafening the ears of all for miles around
her, and her had husband was charging in
the maddest strife, Marian was hurrying
home to diehurrying home to die in the
calm shades of Wharfdale.
CHAPTER XVII.
Thus
things went on in the busy world
abroad, and at home in the quiet vale of
Ingleborough, until some few days after
the deadly fight and desperate defeat at
Long Marston.
Autumn had come againbrown
autum
and
Annabel, now in her garden
tending her flowers, and listening to her
birds, and thinking of the past, not with
the keen and piercing anguish of a
present
sorrow, but with the mellow
recollection
of an old regret. She stood beside
the streamthe stream that all unchanged
itself had witnessed such sad changes in
all that was around itclose to the spot
where she had talked so long with Marian
on that eventful morning, when a quick,
soft step came behind her; she turned,
and Marian clasped her!
No words can describe the feelings of
the sisters as they met; and it was not
till after many a fond embrace, and many
a burst of tears, that Marian told her that
how, after years of sufferance, compelled
at last to fly from the outrageous cruelty
of him, for whom she had thrown up all
but honor, she now came homehome,
like the hunted hare to her form, like the
wounded bird to her nestshe now came
home to die. What could it boot, she
said, to repeat the old and oft-told tale,
how eager passion made way for
uncertain
and oft-interrupted gleams of
fondness
how
a love founded on no esteem
or real principles, melted like wax before
the firehow inattention paved the way
for neglect, and infidelity came close
behind
,
and open profligacy, and bold insult,
and cool, maddened outrage followed.
How the ardent lover became the
careless
husband, the cold master, the
unfeeling
tyrant, and at last the brutal despot.
Marian came home to diethe seeds of
that invincible disease were sown deep in
her bosom; her exquisitely rounded shape
was angular and thin, emaciated by
disease
,
and suffering, and sorrow. A
burning
hectic spot on either cheek were now
the only remnants of that once all-radiant
complexion; her step so slow and falter
ing, her breath drawn sob by sob with
actual
agony, her quick, short cough, all told
too certainly the truth! Her faults were
punished bitterly on earth, and happily
that punishment had worked its fitting end
these faults were all repented, were all
amended now. Perhaps at no time of her
youthful bloom had Marian been so sweet,
so truly lovely, as now when her young
days were numbered.
All the asperity and harshness, the
angles
as it were of her character, mellowed
down into a calm and unrepining
cheerfulness
.
And oh! with what delicious
tenderness
did Annabel console, and pray
with, and caress heroh! they were,
indeed
,
happy! indeed happy for those last
months, those lovely sisters. For
Annabel's
delight at seeing the dear Marian
of happier and better days once more
beside
her, in their old chamber, beside her
in the quiet garden, beside her in the pew
of the old village church, had, for the time,
completely overpowered her fears for her
sister's health, and as is almost invariably
the case in that most fatal, most insidious
of disorders, she constantly was flattered
with vain hopes that Marian was
amending
,
that the next spring would see her
again well and happy. Vain hopes!
indeed
vain hopes; but which of mortal
hopes is other?
The cold mists of November were on
the hills and in the glens of Wharfdale;
the trees were stripped of their last leaves,
the grass was sere and withered, the
earth cheerless, the skies comfortless,
when, at the same predestined window,
the sisters sat watching the last gleam of
the wintry sun fade on the distant hill-top.
What was that flash far up the road?
That round and ringing report? Another!
and another! the evident reports of
musketry
.
And lo! a horseman flyinga wild
fierce troop pursuingthe foremost rides
bareheaded, but the blue scarf that flutters
in the air, shows him a loyal cavalier; the
steel caps and jack-boots of the pursuers,
point them out, evidently, Puritans; there
are but twenty of them, and lo! the
fugitive
gains on themHeaven! he turns
from the highroad! crosses the steep
bridge at a gallop! he takes the park gate
at a leap! he cuts across the turf! and lo!
the dalesmen and the tenants have
mustered
to resista short, fierce struggle!
the roundheads are beaten back! the
fugitive
,
now at the very hall doors, is
preserved
.
The door flew open; he
staggered
into the well-known vestibule,
opened
the parlor-door with an accustomed
4
hand, and reeled into the presence of the
sisters exhausted with fatigue, pale from
the loss of blood, faint with his mortal
woundsyet he spoke out, in a clearvoice,
In time, in time, thank God! in time
to make some reparation, to ask for
pardon
,
ere I die!
And with these words, De Vaux, for he
it was, staggered up to his injured wife,
and, dropping on his knees, cast his arms
round her waist, and burying his head in
her lap, exclaimed, in faltering tones,
Pardon me, Marian, pardon me, before
I die; pardon me, as you loved me once!
Oh! as I love you now, dear Ernest;
fully, completely, gladly do I pardon you,
and take you to my heart, never again to
part, my own dear husband.
Groaning, she clasped him close, and in that
act
And agony her happy spirit fled.
Annabel saw her head fall on his neck,
and fancying that she had fainted, ran to
uplift her; but, ere she had time to do so,
both were beyond the reach of any
mortal
sorrow; nor did she, the survivor, long
survive them; she faded like a fair flower,
and lies beside them in the still bosom of
one common tomb. The hall was
tenanted
no more, and soon fell into ruin; but
the wild hills of Wharfdale must
themselves
pass away, before the children of
the dalesman shall forget the sad tale of
the Sisters.
Lord of the Manor
CHAPTER I.
It
was the morning of the first of May,
that merriest morning of the year, in the
old days of merry England; and never
did a brighter dawning illuminate a fairer
landscape, than that wherein the
incidents
occurred, which form the basis of
one of those true tales that prove how
much there is of wild and strange
romance
even in the most domestic circles
of existence.
The landscape was a portion of the
western slope of a broad English valley,
diversified with meadow-land and
pasture
,
and many a field of green luxuriant
wheat, and shadowy woods, and bosky
dells and dingles; and with a clear,
bright, shallow river rippling along its
pebbly channel, at the base of the soft
hills, which swept down to its flowery
marge in gentle loveliness.
The foreground of the picture, for it was
one indeed, on the left hand side, was
made up of a thick mass of orchards, and
beyond these by a clump of towering
lindens, above which might be seen the
arrowy spire of a village church, piercing
the cool air with its gilded vane and
weathercockthe river sweeping round
and half enclosing the garden grounds,
and cottages seen among the shrubbery,
in a blue glancing reach spanned by a
three-arched bridge of old red brick, all
overrun with ivy. Close to the bridge,
but on the west side of the stream, lay a
large tract of open common, carpeted
with rich short greensward, whereon a
thousand fairy rings were visible, and
sprinkled with all the bright wild flowers
of the early spring. A winding road of
yellow sand traversed the varied surface
of the waste, which was much broken up
by hillocks and deep hollows, alternating
clear sunny lights with cool blue
shadows; and, after crossing the river by
the old bridge, was lost for a little while
among the orchards of the village, till it
again reappeared, near the centre of the
middle distance, above the fringe of
willow
,
birch, and alder bushes, which
skirted all he eastern margin of the river.
Beyond this screen of coppice, the view
extended upward for nearly a mile in
distance
,
over a beautiful park-like lawn,
dotted with clumps of noble trees, and
enclosed on every side by woods of tall
dark oak.
A large white gate gave access to this
fair demesne, with a snug porter's lodge
nestled into a shady covert close beside
it; and at the very crown of the slope
overlooking all the broad and fertile vale,
stood a large mansion of red brick, built in
the quaint architecture of the Elizabethan
era. with large projecting oriels and
tall clustered chimneys, and a wide
freestone
terrace, bedecked with urns and
balustrades, in front; the dwelling
evidently
of the lord of that fair manor. To
the right of the woods, which skirted that
side of the park, lay an abrupt ravine,
through which a brawling trout stream
made its way down, among large blocks
of limestone, and under tangled covert, to
join the river in the valley. Beyond this
gorge, the sides of which were feathered
thick with yew, and box, and juniper,
rose a broad barren hill, crowned by the
grey and weather-beaten keep of an old
Norman castle, frowning in dark sublimity
over the cultured fields, whose fruits its
lords of old had reaped, won by the
mortal
swordand beyond this a range of
purple moors towered, summit over
summit
,
till they were lost at length in the
grey mists of the horizon.
It was, as has been said, the early
dawning of the sweet first of Mayso
early that the sun had not yet reared the
whole of his red dics above the eastern
hills, but half emerged was checkering all
the slopes and the level meadows at the
bottom of the valley with lengthened
streams of ruddy lustre, and casting long
clear shadows from every tree or bush or
stone that met his rays. Yet, early as it
was, the village was alive with merriment
and bustle. A joyous peal was chiming
from the bells of the tall steeple, while a
May-pole that almost vied in height with
the neighboring spire, was planted on the
common by the waterside, where the
ground lay most level to the sunshine,
and where the greensward grew the
mossiest and softest to the tread. The
whole waste land was covered with glad
groups of peasautry, all in their holiday
attire, speeding towards the rendezvous,
beneath a huge gnarled hawthorn, which
had beheld the sports of their grandsires,
now white as if a sudden snow storm
had powdered its dense foliage with the
sweet blossoms that derive their name
from the delicious month which witnesses
their birththe sandy road, too, and the
bridge were glistening with moving
parties
;
while the shrill merry laugh of girls,
and the yet shriller whoop of childhood,
came frequent on the ear from many a
sequestered
spot among the budding or
chardsnor did the rugged castle hill
display
no joyous company; for there, and
through the dim-wood glen and over
the old turn-stile, and the park
itself
,
the happy yeomanry came flocking
to celebrate their feast of flowers.
Just at this moment the parkgates were
suddenly thrown open, and a young man
rode out into the sandy road, accompanied
by several dogs, and followed by three
serving mentwo mounted and the third
on footand taking the downward track,
to the left hand towards the village and the
bridge, was quickly lost to view behind
the willows on the river bank. As he
appeared
,
however, even at that distance,
both by his dress and air to be a person of
superior rank to any of the groups around,
and as I shall have much to do with him
in the course of my narrative, I shall
attach
myself to him during his ride from
the manor gates to the meadow of the
May-pole.
He was a young and extremely
handsome
person, well formed and tall, and
giving promise of great future strength,
when his slender and almost boyish frame
should be developed to its full
proportions
;
for he was, in years, all but a boy,
having on that very morning attained to
his majority, and the possession of the
fine demesnes, and ample fortune, which
now called him master. His hair was
long and slightly curled, of a deep rich
chestnut color; and notwithstanding it
was the fashion of that day, even for the
young and comely, to cover the whole
head with a disfiguring mass of flowing
powdered horse-hair, under the title of a
periwig, he wore his locks all natural and
undisguised; and well they harmonized
with the fine coloring and noble outlines
of his well marked frank features,
sparkling
as they were on that bright happy
morning with gratified ambition, and
high hope, and all the bounding energies
of prosperous unbroken manhood.
There were, it is true, some indications
which would not easily be missed by
an experienced physiognomistthat told
of strong and fiery passions concealed
beneath
that bold and beautiful exterior
there was a quick and hasty sparkle in
the fine open eye, which indicated a
temperament
prone to blaze out, at any check
to its desires, into fierce bursts of angry
vehemence
there
were deep lines for one
so young about the mouth and nostrils,
that clearly spoke of latent but
indomitable
pride; and something, too, of the
existence
of many a voluptuous feeling,
ready to spring up giants from their birth,
when any chance occurrence should
kindle them to sudden life; still, in
despite
these drawbacks to his beauty, for
such in truth they were, he could not fail
to be pronounced, and that too in the
highest sense of the term, a fine and noble
looking man. He was dressed, too, in
the rich fashion of the day, with a low
crowned and broad brimmed beaver,
decked by a hatband set about with
short white ostrich feathershis coat of
grass green velvet, ornamented by a slight
cord of gold, sat closely on his graceful
form; while breeches of white doeskin,
with heavy hunting boots and massive
silver spurs, completed his attire; a light
couteau de chasse
hanging at his side, being
carried rather as an indication of the
wearer's rank, than us a weapon of
defence
;
which, in the set led and peaceful
state of England at that moment, was
almost
as unnecessary as at the present
day.
The dogs, which ran beside his stirrup,
were six or eight in number, and noble
specimens of several choice and favorite
breeds. There was the tall lithe English
bloodhound, with his sleek tawny hide,
his pendulous ears, and coal black mnzzle;
there were two fleet and graceful
greyhounds
,
one white as snow, the other
black as the raven's wing, with their
elastic
limbs and airy gait; there were a leash
of King Charles's spaniels, beautiful silky
creatures, with ears that swept the dew;
and last, though not least in the owner's
estimation, a savage-looking, wire-haired
Scotch terrier, with shaggy jaws, and keen
intelligent expression, though many a scar,
of wounds inflicted in desperate
encounters
with the hill-fox or prowling wild-cat,
seamed his rough grizzly face.
The male attendants of the young
gentleman
were three, as I have said, in
number
;
one a grey-headed,
venerable-looking
man, dressed in a suit of plain
snnff-colored
clothes, and mounted on a strong
brown cob, which set off admirably, by
the contrast, the fine points and superb
condition of the splendid hunter which
carried the young lord of the manor. This
aged man, who was, indeed, the steward,
who had lived on the property in the time
of this youth's father, and to whose care
and faithful management much of the
present
wealth of the estate might be
attributed
,
rode not exactly abreast of his
master
,
nor yet entirely behind him, but so
that while preserving a respeetful
distance
,
to show that he laid claim to no
standing of equality, he was still near
enough to maintain, without any
inconvenience
,
whatever conversation it might
please the younger man to originate.
On the other side, among the dogs,
which looked up to him from time to time
with a very evident mixture of fear and
affection in their features, strode along a
well-built sturdy fellow of some
eight-and-twenty
or thirty years, standing some six
feet in his stockings, and powerful in due
proportion to his height. This man, who
was dressed as a gamekeeper or forester,
with leather buskins on his legs, and a
short musquetoon or carabine in his hand,
was what would be generally called
good-looking
,
by those at least who, in the
habit of regarding the mere animal
qualities
of humanity, neglect the nobler
characteristics
of intellectual beautyfor he
was dark-haired and fresh complexioned,
with a full bright eye and prominent
features
.
There was a strong resemblance,
moreover, in all his lineaments to the calm
and serene face of the old steward; but it
was in the outlines only, and, even of
these, one of the most remarkable in the
father was wholly wanting to the sonfor
such, indeed, was their relationship
namely, the ample and majestic forehead;
which striking feature was changed in the
younger man for a low and receding brow,
giving a mean and vulgar expression to
the whole countenance, which was,
moreover
,
of a dogged and sullen cast, with
large thick sensual lips, heavy and massive
jaws, and all the animal portions of the
head unusually and ungracefully
developed
.
This unprepossessing face, for
such indeed it was, gloomy and lowering,
unless when it was lighted up by a smile
even more inauspicious than the darkness
it relieved, flashed out at times under that
brief illumination with a shrewd gleam,
half cunning, half malignant, which
rendered
it, for the moment, almost fearful
to behold.
The third person was an ordinary
groom, in a blue coat, with a livery badge
on his farm, carrying pistols at his holsters,
and a heavy hunting whip in his right
hand.
Such was the little party which rode
down from the manor gate towards the
village-green, on that May morning, amidst
the loud and hearty congratulations of
every rustic group they passed on their
waythe honest heart of every jolly
yeoman
expanding, as he welcomed to his
new possessions the young man, who had
dwelt among them when a gay and
thoughtless boy, and won affections which
had still remained unchanged throughout
his absence from the home of his fathers,
during his education at school and college,
or, in vacation time, at the distant
mansions
of his guardians.
It did not take the horsement long,
although
the heir pansed several times for
a moment or two to converse cheerily
with some of the older farmers, whom he
remembered to have been kind to him
when a child, or with some of the stalwart
striplings with whom he had fished, or
birdnested, or ferreted wild rabbits, as
companions in the blithe days of boyhood
it did not take the horsemen long to
thread the windings of the sandy road, to
cross the old brick bridge, and reach the
beautiful green meadow, where the tall
May-pole stood, as it had stood for ages,
surrounded by a merry concourse, engaged
in decking it with clusters of the flowery
hawthorn, and garlands of a thousand
dewy blossoms. While one bold boy,
who had elimbed to the summit of the
dizzy mast, was hoisting up a hollow globe
composed of many intersecting hoops,
all bound with wreaths of eglantine and
hawthorn and wild roses, with flaunting
streamers and bright ribbons of every hue
under the sun, to crown the flower-girt
fabric, another group was busied, as the
horsemen wheeled from the high road into
the wide velvet green, in piling up a rustic
throne beneath the aged hawthorn,
composed
of turf bedecked with crocuses and
violets, and the sweet cuckoo buds, and
briony, and bright marsh marigolds from
the stream's berge, and water-lilies from
its stiller reaches, and buttercups and
daisies from the meadows.
All ceased, however, instantly from
their slight labors as the young gentleman
rode forward at a slow pace, his progress
actually hindered by the progress of the
people crowding up to greet their honored
landlord; and a lond ringing shout,
echoed back many times by each
projecting
hill through the long valley, spoke,
and for once sincerely, more of heart-love
than of lip-loyalty.
A brilliant flush of pleasure suffused his
cheeks, and his eyes sparkled with
excitement
,
as he doffed his plumed hat and
bowed repeatedly to his assembled
tenantry
.
He said, however, nothing in reply to
their tumultuous cheering, until the old
steward, pricking his cob gently with the
spur, rode up unbidden to his master's side,
and whispered in his ear
Speak to themspeak to them, Sir
Edwardfor they expect it; and will set
it down to pride, it may be, if you do not.
Speak to them, if it be only twenty
words.
Not I, faith! said the young heir,
laughing; I should stop short for very
bashfulness before I had got ten words
out, let alone twenty. But tell them, good
Adam
No! no! Sir Edwardthe old man
interrnpted him, you
must
, so please you,
be guided for this once by your old
servant
;
your father was a favorite with
them always; and so were you, God bless
you! while you were but a little boy;
and, take my word for it, you shall gain
more of good will, and of general favor
by speaking to them frankly for five
minutes
,
than by distributing five hundred
pounds.
Well, if it must be so, old Adam, I
suppose it must, returned the other,
but by my honor, I had rather scatter
the five hundred pounds you talk about,
among them.
Then drawing himself up in his saddle
without a moment's thought or
preparation
,
he once more doffed his hat, and
addressed
himself in clear and well
enunciated
words, although his tones at first
were somewhat low, and his manner
flurried, to the yeomanry, who stood
around in silent and attentive admiration.
As he went on, however, and gradually
became accustomed to the sound of his
own voice, that voice grew stronger,
clearer, more sonorous, and his air less
embarrassed, till at length, before he had
been speaking quite five minutes, his
notes were even and sustained, flowing
into the ear like a continued strain of
silvery
music.
I thank you, my good friends, he
said, I thank you, from the bottom of
my soul, for this, your frank and
warm-hearted
reception, and, when I say I thank
you, I would not have you fancy that I
am using a mere word, an empty form of
speech, filling the ear indeed, signifying
nothing. No, my good friends and
neighbors
,
when I say here, I thank you, I
mean in truth that my heart is full of
gratitude towards you, and that it is my
full and resolute intention, to prove that
gratitude by my deeds to be done among
you. I am a very young man yet, as you
all knowand, of the few years which
have hitherto been mine, the most have
been passed at a distance from you. Many
of you, whom I see round about,
remember
well my birth and boyhood; as I
remember
many whom I look upon for
their frank, manly kindness towards a
wayward schoolboy; but as I said even
now, I have hitherto lived afar from you,
and you know nothing of my heart or
habits; and therefore, though I feel that
your welcome is sincere, your
congratulations
honest, I am not such a fool of
vanity
,
as to suppose all this aflection and
respectful greeting to be won from you by
any merits of ray own. Oh! no, my
friends, I know it is the legacy, the
precious
legacy of your esteem and love! left
to me by the virtues of a father, a
grandfather
,
a race who have lived here in the
midst of you, for ages, doing good, and
receiving
ample payment in looking on a
free, a prosperous, and a grateful people.
My heart then would be dull, indeed, and
senseless, if I did not appreciate the
richest
legacy of all, which they have left me,
in your hereditary lovemy mind must
be brutish and irrational, if, in perceiving
and appreciating this, I did not perceive
also, how I must merit your affection
how I must make it my own absolute
possession
,
even as it was my father'show
I must leave it to my children, after me
if it please God in his wisdom through me
to continue our line. My friends, I
do
perceive
it! I have come hither to-day, to
live among you, as my fathers didto be
no more your landlord than your friend,
your neighbor, your protector. I will not
draw my revennes from the country, to
layish them on the idlers of the town!
No! my friends, where my father's life
was passed, there I will pass mine,
likewise
;
and when the time allotted here to
us shall be measured to its end, I trust
thet I shall lay my bones beside his bones
in your quiet churchyard! Now, mark
what I would say, for I must not be
tedious
;
I promise you that no man's rent
shall be screwed up by me, beyond his
own ability to psy, so he be sober,
industrious
,
and frugal! I promise you that no
new tenant shall be preferred before an
old one, so long as he deal with me justly.
I promise you, that no strong man shall
want good work, and ready paymentno
sick man medicine and succorno old
man aid and comfortno poor man
whatsoever
help his exigencies need, that I can
give to him, so long as God continue me
among you. This, then, I promise you,
not as a boon or bounty, but as I hold it
here to be my bounden dutyand this
will I make good to you, so surely as my
name is Edward Hale of Arrington! Now
I will trouble you no more, except to pray
you to continue your sports, as if I were not
present; and to request you all to dine
with me at noon, on good old English
beef and pudding. My fellows will be
down anon, to pitch some tents here on
the green, and set the ale a-flowingand
so once more I thank you.
It is probable that no set oration,
delivered
by the mightiest of the world's
rhetoricians, bedecked with all the gor
geous ornaments that genins can produce
from its immortal garners, was ever
listened
to with more profound and rapt
attention
,
than the few simple words, which
flowed as it appeared so naturally from
the heart to the tongue of the young
landlord
.
It is certain, that none ever sank
more deeply into the feelings of the
audience
their
better, holier feelings! There
was no violent outburst of pleasureno
loud tumultnous cheeringbut a deep
husha breathing silence! Many of the
old men, and all the women, were in
tears; and when they spoke, at length, it
was with husky interrupted voices that
they invoked Heaven's blessings on his
head; and when they thought, it was
with gratitude for their own happy lot in
owning such a master.
Sir Edward was himself affected, partly
it might be from the excitement of
delivering
a first speech, and that with
success
so apparent and completeit might
be from the geauine warmth of his own
heart, and strength of his own feelings;
for the hearts of the young are almost ever
warm, whether for good or for evil, and
their emotions powerful and abundant;
and oftentimes it happens, that the mere
speaking forcibly of feelings, which
perhaps
at the time exist but faintlyand as
I might say speculativelywill give those
feelings actual force, and cause them to
develope themselves with new and
unsuspected
vigor. And so it surely was with
Edward Hale, in this case.
He was, as we have seen, extremely
youngnot in years only, but in
knowledge
of the worldand volatile, and
hasty, and impetnoustoo much, indeed,
a creature and a child of impulseI say
not that his impulses were evilI believe
not that the impulses of the very young
are so, except in rare and almost
monstrous
instances; but they were impulses,
ungoverned, uncontrolled by any
principle
,
any set rule of action, any guide of
religionand, therefore, even when most
originally good, they were liable to be
pushed into excesses; to be deceptive; to
be self-deceivers; to degenerate into
downright vices. That Edward Hale had
thought at times of the condition of his
subordinate fellows, is most truethat he
had often dreamed bright day-dreams
concerning the happiness of a half
patriarchal
life among his tenants, is
undoubted
;
and that his tastes, his habits, his
pursuits
,
all led him to prefer a country to a
city residence, no less so.
So it is true, that being liberal as the
windnay, almost lavishcharity, so far
at least as charity consists in giving, was
an accustomed and familiar pleasure;
that, like all men of glowing and
enthusiastic
minds, he was by no means
without
some crude and undigested notions of
a wild species of Utopian justice! that he
was of too bold and fiery a temperament
not to abhor and loathe the very name of
fraud or falsehoodand more, to do him
simple justice, too kindly-hearted to be
cruel, or systematically overbearing and
oppressive. Still, it is no less certain that
until that very morningnay, until the
very minute when accident called on him
to deliver an impromptu speech, when the
excitability of his emotions, and his
gratification
at his warm reception by his
tenants
set loose the flood-gates of his fancy
and his heartfor in this instance, both
were acted on, and both reacted in
connexion
he
had never thought
consecutively
for half an hour on the subject;
never had laid out for himself any rule or
principle at all; never had, indeed,
considered
that he owed any duties to his fellow
men.
What then, I fancy I can hear the
reader say, What then, was Edward
Hale a hypocrite? Was all his fine,
apparently
free-hearted speech a piece of
absolute
deception Neither, dear reader,
neither; the young are rarely, oh! very
rarely, hypocrites; rarely deceivers even,
nuless it be from fear, in timid
dispositions
,
of some contingent evils, which
they imagine they can shum by falsehood.
And Edward Hale was neither; scarce
even a deceiver of himself.
He had returned, only the previous
night, to the home of his happy boyhood,
after years of absence; had looked upon
the picture of a mother, whom he almost
adored; had trodden the floors, along which
he had bounded years ago; how changed
and yet the same; and everything he saw,
and heard, and thought of, conspired to
call up his better feelings, and to attune
his spirit to a mood more reflectivenay,
almost melancholythan his wont. A
passionate lover of the charms of nature,
he had felt, while he gazed out from his
window over the lovely landscape, while
he rode in all the consciousness of power
and health, on his splendid hunter,
beneath
his ancestral trees, he had felt, I say,
that he could never love a spot on earth
so well as his own fair demesnes; that he
could never live so happily or with so
calm a dignity in any other place, as he
could here among his people. Theu,
when he found himself quite
unexpectedly
the object of affection so enthusiastic,
of greetings so sincere and earnest, his
fancy pictured to him in a moment, the
pure and exquisite delights of such a life
as he described in his brief speech; his
heart yearned to the kind and humble
yeomanry, whose very souls, apparently,
were overflowing with love to all his race.
He spoke embarrassed at the first, and
faltering and undecided; but, as he
warmed
to his task, his rich imagination woke;
image suggested image, and though
perhaps
,
he actually thought, now for the
first time of many of the things he stated,
they glowed so vividly before the eyes of
his mind, that he believed them for the
moment to be old and familiar ideasthe
well remembered consequences of past
reasoning. He believed from the bottom
of his heart, that every word he uttered
was strictly and indisputably true; not for
his life would he have uttered one, had
he not so believed! And when he
ceased
to speak, he was affected by the very
ideas that his own lively fancy had, for
the first time, set before him; and he
could safely then have registered a vow in
heaven that such had
always been
his view
of his own duties; and that so he would
surely act, as long as he lived to act on
earth at all.
As he ceased speaking, he turned his
horse half round, as if to leave the green,
saying to a fine hearty-looking yeoman
who stood nearest to him, one of the
patriarchs
,
unquestionably, of the place.
I must ride, Master Marvel, to
Stowcum-Barnesley
,
to meet some college
friends of mine, who promised to come
down and spend my birth-day with me;
but it is early yet, you know, and Oliver
here. patting as he spoke the proud neck
of his horse, makes nothing of fifteen
miles an hour; so I can ride thither easily,
and he back with my friends to dinner.
Aye, that thou canst, Sir Edward,
returned
the old man, laughing cheerily
Aye, that thou canst; so go thy ways, go
thy ways, and God speed thee!
Edward Hale touched his horse lightly
with the spur, that he made one quick
bound forward; but as he did so, the
rider
turned half round in his saddle, for
something caught his attention so keenly
that his eye sparkled, and his cheek
flushed
suddenly. The consequence was, that
he checked Oliver so sharply with the
curb, although involuntarily, that he reared
bolt upright, and by the suddenness of the
movement, so nearly unseated his master,
that his hold on the saddle depended for
a moment on the rein, and consequently
the strain was increased greatly on the bit.
The hunter stood erect, pawing the air
with his fore-feet, as if in an effort to
retrieve
his balance. Every one thought
he must have fallen backward, crushing
his rider in the fall, and a shrill female
shriek rang piercingly into the air; but,
active, young, and fearless, Sir Edward
scarce perceived the error he had
committed
before he repaired it. Throwing
himself forward in his stirrups, by a rapid
and elastic spring, he wreathed his
fore-finger
lightly in the mane, and gave the
horse the spur so sharply that he made a
violent plunge forward and alighted on his
fore-feet with a dint that threw the turf into
the air, in fifty several fragments, but failed
to move the horseman in his saddle in the
slightest degree.
Then the hot temper of the young man
rose; and though a moment's thought
would have shown him that the horse was
in no respect to blame, he checked him
again almost fiercely with the heavy curb,
and spurred him till the blood spirted from
his sides, under the galling rowels. Stung
by the treatment, the noble beast yerked
out his heels, and fell into a quick
succession
of balotades, croupades, and
caprioles
,
and furious plunges, such as must
have inevitably cast headlong to the earth
a less accomplished cavalier than he who
backed him now.
Firm as a rock in his demique sat
Edward
Hale, as though he had been a
portion
of the animal which he bestrode;
but maddened by the resistance offered to
his first momentary action of injustice, he
plied both lash and spur with almost
savage
impetuosity, yet with so rare a skill,
that in five minutes' space, or even less,
the brown horse stood stock still, panting,
and humbled, and subdued.
He gazed around him for a moment,
with a triumphant and defying glance;
and without again looking in the direction
of the object, whatsoever it was, that had
before attracted his attention, he bade his
mounted groom give up his horse to the
game-keeper, and stay himself to wait on
master Adam Eversley. The change was
accomplished in a minute; and, without
any further words, he dashed into a gallop,
and was speedily lost to view beyond the
summit of the hills, which bounded the
valley to the westward.
Oh! father, cried a beautiful country
girl, who was leaning on the arm of an old
grey-headed farmer, Oh, father, father,
how beautifully young Sir Edward spoke,
and what a kind speech that was, and
then how well he sat on that vicious horse
of his, and how quickly he did master
him. He is the handsomest gentleman, I
think, in all the country; and the
best-hearted
too, I'll warrant him.
And yet, Rose, answered a young
stalwart yeoman, who had been standing
close beside her, leaning on a long
twohauded
quarter staff, and yet Rose, it
was all of his own fault, that the poor
horse was vicions; and then see how he
dealt with the dumb beast for his own
failing. He is a handsome man, that's true,
as ever an eye looked upon; but did you
see the way his black brows met together;
how the passion flashed out, almost like
lightning, under them; and how he bit
his lips till the blood came? Be sure, now,
he has a fearful temper. Why he looked
liker to a handsome devil, than to a
Christian
man! I would be loth to stand against
him, in aught he had set his heart on.
For shamefor shame to thee, Frank
Hunter, cried the girl he had addressed
as RoseFor shame on thee, to speak so
of the young winsome gentleman. I hate
an envious spirit; and he so kind, too,
and so gentledidst not hear what he
promisedhow no poor man should ever
want for anything; and how no sick man
should need doctoring, so long as his
name was Edward Haleand then to liken
him to a devil! I'm sure, I think he
looked
like an angel, and spoke like an angel,
too, just come down to us out of heaven!
Have a care, Rose, returned the other,
gloomily, have a care, lest he lure thee
to somewhat that will not lead thee up
there; whether he came down out of
heaven
or no. I reckon it 'was all along o'
looking at those brown curls and hazel
eyes o' thine, that he came so near falling
from his saddle.
Why, here's a nice to do,
answered
the girl, very sharply, and what
an' he was looking at my curls, or my eyes
either; what is that, master Hunter, to
thee, I'd be pleased to knowor who gave
thee the right to say who shall look at me:
or whom I shall look at either, for that
matter
?
You are no kin of minemuch less
a master.
Oh, Rose! Rose! can it be come to this,
between usand we troth-plighted, too!'
Aye has it, answered Rose, tossing
her pretty head, aye, has it come to this
and better now than later!better
troth-plighted
,
and rue the plighting! than wed
and rue the wedding!better an envious
sweetheart and a jealous, than a hard
tyrannizing
husband! Aye, has it come to
this, and thou must mend thy manners,
ere aught else come of it, I tell thee.
Her father tried to interpose; but the
village beauty was quite too indignant to
be appeased so readily; and she left his
arm instantly, turning her back without
ceremony on her luckless swain, saying
that she must go and join Susan Fairly,
for all the girls were seeking her. So
little
does it need to raise a quarrel between
those who truly and sincerely love each
other especially in quick and ardent
dispositions
.
CHAPTER II.
It
often happens that, in places far
removed
each from the other, events are
occurring
to different individuals, almost at
the same moment, which are destined to
produce the most serious results to other
persons, who are equally ignorant of the
present action, and unsuspicious of the
future consequence. So intricately and
inextricably blended are the threads of
mortal life, and so wonderfully linked are
those chains of cause and effect, in which
even unborn generations are not
unfrequently
involved, by that vast and all
comprehensive
Providence which mortals in
their blindness are wont to call chance.
Especially was this the case with Sir
Edward
Hale, at the present moment of my
tale; though he would have laughed very
heartily had any one told him that the
whole happiness of his future life was
brought into jeopardy, while he was
thinking
only of the pleasures of the hour, by
the intrigues of men in London, some of
whom he had never seen, and scarcely
even heard of; yet such unquestionably
was the case.
It was about seven o'clock on the same
morning that a plain dark carriage,
containing
a tall, thin, grave looking
gentleman
,
with a peculiarly sardonic smile,
drove rapidly from the door of the
Secretary
of State, at whose house an
extraordinary
cabinet council had been just held,
through Charing Cross, where the
magnificent
statue of King Charles the First, by
Hubert le Sur, had resumed its position,
and passed the stately front of
Northumberland
House, towards Spring Gardens.
Here it paused, before the portico of a
stately mansion; and the footman
springing
down from the board behind the
chariot
,
notwithstanding the earliness of the
hour, raised such a noisy snmmons as soon
brought a servant to the door, when the
name of the untimely visitor procured his
admittance without delay, although the
man appeared somewhat reluctant
saying
that the Earl was not yet awake, and
had left word that he should not be
disturbed
,
as it was very late when he retired.
I know it, my good friend, replied the
visitorI know that it was very late;
but it was later by two hours before I was
abed, and I have been up, I assure you,
since four o'clock this morning. But,
leaving this aside, which is no matter, I
will be your security that you will do no
wrong in awakening my lord, seeing that
I have news for him about which he is
very anxious; and it is, moreover, on
business
of his majesty that I must see him.
This, of course, put an end, on the
instant
,
to all discussion or remonstrance on
the subject, the man showing him
immediately
into a handsome library,
containing
several thousand volumes, and
decorated
with many busts, and two or three
fine antique statues.
Begging the visitor, with whom he
appeared
to be well acquainted, to take a
seat while he apprised the Earl of his
arrival
,
he then withdrew, but returned in a
few minutes, saying, My lord, Sir
Henry
,
will be down in a quarter of an hour,
at the furthest, and begs that you will
wait for him. He desired me to ask if you
would take some chocolate, Sir Henry!
Yes, bring me some, Anderson, if it be
ready; and, hark ye, tell my fellows to go
home with the chariot; I will walk, when I
go hence.
As soon as the man had left the room,
the other arose from his chair and walked
towards one of the tall book-cases, as if to
seek a volume wherewith to while away
the time; but, after he had opened the
glass doors, and suffered his eyes to run
over a shelf or two, he either changed his
mind or fell into a different train of
thought, and forgot it; for he turned round
abruptly, and walked across the room with
his hands clasped behind his back.
It must be done! it must, he muttered
to himself; we must have his vote, or
the whole thing is at an end, and we may
just as well give up the campaign at once!
But this will do it; I think, I dare swear it
will! and, if notif notwe must give
him more; though, hang me! if I know
what there is that we
can
give him that he
is fit for! The garter! aye, the gartera
rare successor he to the great champions
of the order! And he smiled, with the
bitter, sneering, caustic expression that has
been mentioned as peculiar to him.
At this moment the servant returned,
bearing a silver salver, with a tall
chocolate
pot of the same metal, richly
embossed
,
and a couple of superb
French-china
cups. Scarcely, however, had he
frothed and poured out the rich beverage,
which had but lately been introduced into
England, and was still a rarity, before his
master entered the library, in some small
agitation, as it seemed, and perhaps even
anxiety. He was a tall and powerfully
made man, of some fifty-seven or
fifty-eight
years, with features that would have
been positively handsome had there been
a solitary gleam of intelligencea single
trace expressing anything of character in
their symmerrical outlines and
harmonioas
coloring. He was magnificently,
though not completely, attired in the
costume
of the day; wearing a dressing gown
of splendid brocade in place of the
embroidered
coat, and a cap of green velvet,
with a gold band and tassel, in lien of the
huge periwig, which was then an
essential
part of a gentleman's full dress.
Give you good day, Sir Henry, he
said as he entered, with a bland smile upon
his face, which did not, however, conceal
a nervousness of manner that told
something
of eager and fretful expectation.
You come so early that, as you see, I
make no ceremony with you; I have not
even tarried to finish dressing, as I
presumed
you were in a hurry.
I thank you much, my lord, returned
the other, sipping his chocolate, both
for what you have done, and what you
have left undone; for, indeed, I have
something
to say to you of moment. Then,
seeing that he did not take the hint, as
he expected he would do, and dismiss
the valet, who stood with both his ears
wide open, ready to drink in every word,
he said carelessly, Excellent chocolate,
this, my lord, but I do not think it has ever
paid any duty.
No, no! not it, not it! Sir Henry,
answered
the penderous earl, making
precisely
the reply for which his guest was
looking. I had it in a present from my
good friend the French Ambassador.
Ah! ah! answered Sir Henry
Davenant
,
as if thoughtfully, and
upropos
of
French, had you Anderson, here, with you
when you were at Paris last?
No; he came to me after my return,
said the obtuse earl, not yet perceiving
that the drift of Sir Henry's question was
to call his attention to the presence of the
man. After a few minutes, however,
during
which he appeared to ruminate very
sagely, he lifted up his head with what he
intended for a very knowing smile, and
told his valet that he need not wait.
Very deep of youvery deep, that,
Sir Henry. Almost too deep! for, drown
me for a witch if I caught your meaning
at first!
But why in Heaven's name, my dear
lord, do you keep such a long-eared knave
as that about you? Why, curiosity is
written as plainly as the name of a book
on its title-page, in every feature of his
face; the very owning such a fellow is
enough almost to destroy one's reputation
for diplomacy. It is true that the Earl of
Asterly has less need to regard such things
than we beginners; but, nevertheless,
even with your finesse, I would hardly
desire
to risk it!
Ha! ha! you are flattering meyou
are flattering me, I am afraid, Sir Henry;
though you have not very much the
character
of saying pretty things, even to the
ladies, bless their souls! And, while he
spoke, it was as evident as the sun in
heaven
,
that he had swallowed the dose,
palpable
as it was, without wincing, or
suspecting
that it was, even as he said, a
mixture of the grossest adulation with the
most barefaced ridicule But, come,
he added, after another pause of
hesitation
,
unbuckle your budget, my good
sir; what can you possibly have to say to
me so early this morning?
Why, the fact is, my lord, answered
Davenant, who filled at that time the very
useful post, in reference to the then
ministry
,
which is now known as that of
Whipper-in to the House of Commons,
that, as I told you would be the case,
when I had the honor of speaking with
you last night, there has been a meeting
of the cabinet at Mr. Secretary's house,
this morning.
And the wily baronet paused at this
piece of information, partly to give his
heavy auditor time to take in its whole
meaning, and partly because he wished
to see exactly what was the amount of
his dupe's anxiety on the subject.
Indeed, indeed? the earl replied, in
the tone of one inquiring further; you
are well informed always, Sir Henry; and
what then? What was the result of their
conference, my dear sir?that is to say,
if it may be spoken.
Oh, yes, my lord, it may be spoken.
If that were not the case, you would not
have seen me here this morning, for my
object in coming was purely to give you
the information; which I have leave to do
from Mr. Secretary, and a message from
him, likewise, that is to say, if the
government
may rely, as they presume they can,
on the continued support of the Earl of
Asterly. If not, why, I must keep my
budget closed; which I should be the
more sorry to do, because, if opened, it
contains news that I think would give
you pleasure.
Oh! yes, Sir Henry, replied the peer,
immediately. His majesty's
government
may certainly count on my support
in all matters consistent with the Protest
But before he could get out the whole
word and commit himself to any measure,
Davenant interrupted him.
Oh! my dear lord, of course, the
cabinet
will not attempt to carry any measure
out, which shall not have received,
previously
,
your distinguished approbation.
But your lordship is too good a politician,
not to feel that no ministry would be
justified
in submitting a plan of its campaign,
and perhaps offering honors, to any
gentleman
or nobleman, how sure soever
they might feel of his support, without
something more definite, in the shape of
a pledge
Ah! said the earl, affecting to ponder
on what he had heard, but in reality
endeavoring
to outwit the keen clear-sighted
diplomatist, who could read every
thought in his bosom, almost before it was
formed. Ah! that makes all the
difference
!
That is to say, thought Davenant in
his own heart, the hope of office, or
additional
rank, makes all the difference.
Showing your hand, rather too openly, my
good lord!
That makes all the difference, Sir
Henry, he resumed, for, as you say, the
fact of the ministry being desirous of
consulting
me on their measures, or indeed of
their asking for my support at all, is as I
think a sufficient guarantee of their
intentions
.
For it is evident that they could
not imagine it possible that I should lend
my countenance to measures
Of which your lordship's well known
capacity and foresight should not induce
you cordially to approve. You take the
same views of the matter which I do
myself
,
my lord. The noble lords, now at
the head of his majesty's government,
doubtless would not expect anything
incompatible
with Lord Asterly's known
character for political consistency and
personal integrity. Nevertheless, it is
their resolution in the present unsettled
state of parties, and I think your lordship
will admit it to be a necessary and a wise
one, to associate no person, however
great his merits, with themselves, unless
it be upon an unconditional pledge.
Well, sir, I cannot blame them, upon
my word, Sir Henry, I cannot. For there
is now-a-days so much political
tergiversation
,
even in the highest quarters, that
no one can be absolutely above
suspicion
!and,
at the very moment he said
this, despite all his dullness, he clearly
understood what was expected of him;
and, having fully made up his mind to
desert his party for a consideration, was
only now endeavoring to conceal his pre
meditated baseness from Sir Henry; which
he had about as much chance of doing,
as the ostrich, when it buries its hend in
the sand of the desert, has of keeping its
body hidden from the lynx-eyed Arabian
hunter.
Then I am to understand, my lord,
that you do not object to give such a
pledge to the Secretarya written pledge,
my lord?
Whynono! said Lord Asterly, in
a sort of half-doubtful tone, not
absolutely
no!
I should not absolutely
objectbut I should like to know
something
a little more definite about the
nature of the measures!
Well, then, my lord, returned Sir
Henry Davenant, since your lordship is
so scrupulous, for which I confess I honor
you so much the more, I will venture to
give you a few hints. In the first place,
the captured French colonies will not be
given up under any circumstances! This
piece of information, by the way, was the
more valuable, because it was the first
any one
had ever received concerning the
question of their cession; which had
never once been mooted. But
notwithstanding
this, the earl expressed his grave
satisfaction at the firmness of the noble
lords.
In the next place, his grace of B
will have the vice-royalty of Ireland. The
earl of F goes as ambassador to
France, and your humble servant, I
believe
,
to the Haguebut that is not quite
certain yet!the other two appointments
having been known to all the
quidnuncs
of
the town for a week past, the earl learned
little by this last sentence, and that little,
utterly of no account; but he replied
ExcellentexcellentSir Henry, no
better men for the offices, than they. I
will say that it does honor to Mr.
Secretary's
discernment. For I presume he had
a word to say in the appointments.
Surely, my lord, surely. His word,
I may say, is almost omnipotent with their
lordships; and that, I fancy, is one reason
why he is so desirous of attaching you,
my lord, with some others of his friends,
to the party; while he is himself in
power.
The Earl of Asterly noted and treasured
up the words, but pretending not to have
given them much attention, he added
But have you nothing more to tell
me?
Faith! very little more, my lord, there
will be several new additions to the
peerage
two
or three ancient titles to be
raised to a higher grade; and then, there
are, you know, the two vacant garters
But upon my life! he added, breaking
off suddenly, this is scarce fair of your
lordship; here, you have pumped me of
almost all my secrets, and given me
nothing
satisfactory after all. But I trust
your lordship will deal kindly with me,
this would go far to ruin me with the
great man, if it got wind.
Why! ha! ha! responded the earl,
langhing very knowingly, I think I have
been a little hard on you, Sir Henry, a
little too hardI believe! But, ha! ha!
ha! you young fellows ought not to fancy
that you can hood-wink us old boys!
wellwellwell!but, as you say, I
must make it up with you. See here, I
will write a word or two; pray you,
excuse me.
Could the dull nobleman have marked
the cold, calm, cutting smile, ineffably
contemptuous and full of loathing, with
which the politician surveyed him, while
he penned his memorandum, well cased
as he was in complete panoply of
self-conceit
,
and gross, complacent stolidity,
he must have been cut to the quick; but
he did not raise his head till he had
finished writing, and when he did so,
Davenant's eyes were fixed on the ground
in quiet and apparently conscious
humility
.
The earl pushed the sheet of paper, on
which he had written a few lines with his
signature appended to them, across the
table to Sir Henry, saying
There, my good friend; see if that will
meet Mr. Secretary's views!
It was a full and formal promise to
support
,
with all his personal and political
influence, the present cabinet in all its
measures whatsoever.
I presume, he added, that of course
it will not be shown.
Of course not, my lord, Sir Henry
answered, as he took it; and then, after
casting his eyes slightly over the
document
,
Perfectlyperfectly satisfactory,
he added; nothing can be more
honorable
,
open, or above board. And now,
my lord, allow me to congratulate you
To congratulate
me
, Sir Henry! upon
what? said Lord Asterly, with a pleasant
and conscious smile, which be endeavored
vainly to dissemble.
There is a dormant marquisate in your
lordship's family, I believe. Beverley, is it
not? which your lordship claimed from
the last ministry.
And was refused! replied the earl,
hanghtily, owing to the opposition, I
think, of my Lord Calverly, who lays claim
to it likewise, though he has no more plea
of right, than he has to the dukedom of
Northumberland! I never cared much
about it myself, Sir Henry; but it was an
old hobby of my father's; and in respect
to his memory, it was, that I revived the
claim.
And gross injustice was done to you
in the refusal. Well, my lord, in
consideration
of this, his majesty has been pleased
of his own accord, quite unsolicited, to
creare you Marquis of Beverley, and I am
happy to be the first person to salute you
by the ancient title of your family.
Indeed! Sir Henry, indeed!
exclaimed
the new marquis, exceedingly gratified;
this is indeed very flattering. His
majesty
is very graciousthe rather, as you
say, that it is quite unsolicited; and that
no one can say that it is a reward of any
party services!
Old hand as he was at intrigue, and an
adept at concealing every emotion,
Davenant
could hardly refrain from laughing
aloud at the impudent self-complacency of
this speech, when he thought of the
precious
document which he had just
pocketed
;
but he did refrain, and answered
quietly
,
and as a matter of course.
Yes! marquis, it must be very
gratifying
.
But now et us speak of business.
The Irish Bill, comes on, you know next
Tuesday se'nnight, and by it the ministry
have determined that they will stand or
fall.
The Irish Bill! indeed! the Irish Bill!
said the marquis, as he must now be called,
I did not look for that! you should have
told me of that, Sir Henry.
Why, marquis, answered Davenant,
as if surprised, I took it for granted that
you must see that. It followed as a
natural
consequence, from his Grace's
nomination
to the vice-royalty.
And so it didand so it didupon my
word! replied the other, quite as much
relieved by the futile explanation, as if it
were a satisfactory excuse for his
adopting
the measures to-day, which yesterday
he had repudiated; I never thought of
that before.
I felt quite certain that you would view
it in that light, when you came to reflect,
answered Davenant.
CertainlycertainlyI could not do
otherwise, said the marquis; but what
was it you said about the garter? who did
you say were to succeed to the two vacant
stalls?
I did
not
say, marquis, for I don't
know; and I don't know, simply because
it has not yet been determined by their
lordships.
Not yet determined! Is not that very
strange? a matter, tob, of so great and
paramount importance.
Doubtless there are strong reasons for
delay, marquis. In the first place,
notwithstanding
the accession of strength to
the government from the complete
over-throw
of the Duke of Monmouth's people
at Sedgemoor, and the final close of all
that infamous affair, you are aware that
there is still a very strong opposition
and on this Irish questionby the way,
how many votes do you carry with you,
marquis?
Five in the Lower House, and in the
Peers, my son-in-law Helvelyn's, in
addition
to my own.
Oh! in the Peers we are safe enough;
but, to be frank with you, marquis, there is
a good deal to fear in the Commonsat
the best, we can only count a tie,
reckoning
all your votesand, I fancy, though I
do not know it for certain, that any one
who could bring over one or two votes so
as to make sure of a majority, might reckon
pretsy certainly on the garter.
Aye! aye! responded the marquis,
falling into a deep fit of cogitation, from
which he presently aroused himself to
inquire
who were the members that
remained
at all doubtful.
Why, by my honor! answered
Davenant
,
there are but three whom we dare
even to count doubtfuland they are at
the present dead against usthe only
reason
why I call them doubtful, is that they
are against us from whim only, or what
they call principle, and not from any
pledge, or any great interest that they
have in the matter.
And who are they?
First of all, Captain Trevor
Why don't you give him a
regiment
?
It would not dohe is not at all that
sort of manbesides, it is hardly worth
the while to try him; he has a grudge of
some kind, I believe, against Berkley, and
we may set him down against us without
more ado. The next is Frampton of
Frampton, and as there is not a newly
imported
Arab stallion, or an invincible
gamecock
of extraordinary lineage, to be got
for love or money in the kingdom, we have
no means of bribing him. As for offering
him rank, that is useless to a man who
thinks that to be Frampton of Frampton
is a far finer thing than to be premier peer
of England, if we could make him that,
which we can't. Moneyworse yet, to a
fellow who complains that he cannot for
his life get through a third of his rent roll;
though I believe he feeds half the East
Riding with beef and beer the year round.
Ashley did speak of sending to the Dey of
Algiers for a barh; but there is not time
enough. So he is a lost vote, too! The
third and last is Lord Henry St. Maur.
Ah! St. MaurSt. Maur! is he
inclined
against you?
Not inclined merely. He has declared
himself opposed to all our measures; and
he is too young, too full of generous and
high fantasies to be approachable.
And yet I think I could approach him
on the subject, said the marquis.
You, my lord, you! Impossible! cried
Davenant, the whole aim and object of
whose mission was simply to procure the
influence of his man on young St. Maur.
Impossible! we were not aware even
that you knew him.
I do, but very slightly, answered
Beverley; and yet I think he can he won.
Nay! I almost think I can promise you
his vote. Do you know where he is, Sir
Henry?
By accident, I do; for I called at his
father's yesterday. He is on a visit to some
young country bumpkin of a baronet or
other, at Arrington, in Hampshirethe
post town is Stow-cum-Barnesley.
Indeed, at Sir Edward Hale'sis he?
HaleHale! By George! I believe
Hale was the name. Upon my word,
marquis
,
you seem to know all the world.
My place is near Oxford, you know,
Sir Henry, and this young fellow was at
Christ Church, with my son, who brought
him to Asterley last year in the long
vacation
.
But he is not at all a bumpkin.
I dare say not, indeedfor I know
nothing
about itonly Fred Jermyn, of the
Life Guards, was laughing at him for a
quiz the other night, at the Nag's Head,
replied Davenant, who never said a word
without its object, and who had now his
own peculiar reason for doing the young
baronet an ill office with the marquis.
I will write to St. Maur to-day, said
the marquis, after a moment's thought, I
am nearly sure that I can secure you his
vote.
I do not think it is possible, said
Davenant
,
knowing all the time that it was
pretty certain, if the old peer only chose to
exert himself on the right track. It
would require immense influence
immense
influence!
I flatter myself I have a good deal of
influence over him, answered the
marquis
,
knowingly.
I thought you said, but now, that you
only knew him slightly?
I do only know him slightly.
Then how, in the devil's name, Sir
Henry began, with well feigned
astonishment
,
when the peer interrupted him
Ask me no questionsit is a secret
but I tell you, that Mr. Secretary may
make himself tolerably easy on the
matter
.
I will write to him this very day,
and I shall have an answer by to-morrow
night, for I will send one of my fellows
post.
You
are
an extraordinary man,
marquis
;
but, if you accomplish this, I shall
set you down as a second Mazarin. Well!
well! you are a fortunate man, too; for I
see that you will be the wearer of this
garter, which his grace of Lauderdale, they
say, is looking after.
Fie! fie! Sir Henryfie! Do you
suppose that a thought of that kind ever
occurred to me? Oh nofie! fie! but,
on my word, I believe I can do it.
I trust that you may not be
disappointed
.
But, in the meantime, I will take my
leave; for I can hear the marchioness',
and the pretty Lady Fanny's voices in the
breakfast parlor. Besides which, I must
make haste with this good news to master
Secretary.
Then, with the courtly ceremonial of
the day, he took his leave; but as he
crossed the threshold, he muttered to
himself
Cursed old hypocrite and knave! and
idiot, worse than either, for daring to
imagine that he could hoodwink me.
Well! never mind, St. Maur will get Lady
Fan's pretty hand, and we shall get his
vote; and Beverley his garter; and, what is
worth all the rest, I shall go to the Hague!
the Hagueand thenand then!' and he
walked rapidly away, in the direction of
Whitehall, with his whole brain boiling
with ambition, and his whole heart elated
and self-confident.
As soon as he had left the room, the
new-ereated marquis rang his bell, and
when his valet entered
Anderson, he said, let Perkins take
the green chariot, that has the coronet
only and the cipher on the panels, in
embossed
work, down to the coachmaker's,
and have them altered instantly for a
coronet
and the letter Bthe silver-mounted
harness must be all changed likewise, in
the same manner. Do you understand?
Yes, my lord.
And let him tell Mr. Ryckman that all
must be ready by two hours after noon
that it
must
be ready. I shall require it to
go to St. Stephen's. My Lady's chairs must
be remounted also, and the coach newly
paintedand do you see that the liveries
are correct
Correct, my lord?
Yes! correct, you blockheadcorrect!
The Marquis of Beverley'sdo you
understand
,
you stupid fellow?
Yes, my lord marquis, replied the
man, with an obeisance almost oriental in
its depth and durationyour orders
shall be performed instantly, my lord
marquis.
Now, then, follow me to the dressing
room, I want my coat, and periwig, and
sword. Has the marchioness come down
stairs yet?
Yes, my lord marquis.
And strutting away like a peacock, with
his head half a foot higher than when he
had come down stairs, as yet an honest
man, he conceived that he had made a
capital bargain in swopping a way his own
conseience, and the happiness of two or
three human beings, one of them his own
daughter, for an empty title, and a yard of
satin ribbon!
CHAPTER III.
In
the room adjoining the library where
the Earl of Asterlynow Earl, or Asterly,
no longerand his ministerial guest had
been carrying on their political
machinations
,
two ladies were seated at a
breakfast
table, which, for the benefit of the
pleasant air of the sweet May morning,
had been drawn up to a large open
window
of the French fashion; giving access
to a balcony full of the rarest exotics
cultivated
at that day.
The room was sumptuously furnished in
the gorgeous style of the period, with
cabinets of buhl and marquetry, tables
inlaid
with the most precious Indian woods,
armed chairs and sofas cushioned with
Genoa velvet, curtains of flowered
brocade
,
Persian or Turkey carpects, several
fine pictures by Sir Peter Lely and
Vandyke
,
and two or three well executed
marble statues, copies from the antique,
the taste for which articles of virtu had
just begun to be considered fashionable in
England, when it was checked for awhile
by the rude and ignorant barbarism of
the Puritan iconoclasts, not to revive
again until the kingdom returned to the
rule of its legitimate hereditary monarchs.
The ladies were very different both in
age and appearancemore different,
indeed
,
in appearance, than the difference
in age would seem to justify in relations so
near as a mother and her daughter. The
elder lady was a small, slight, meagre
person
,
considerably below the middle size;
and, though she had been praised and
admired
in the zenith of her womanhood for
the sylph-like and graceful symmetry of
her proportions, her figure was now
angular
and emaciated, and almost disagreeable
to look upon. Her face, and features, too,
had in her younger days been called
handsome
,
and to this hour her high and
intellectual
forehead bad preserved its fiue
contour
,
and its expressiou of solidity and
thoughtfulness. Little, however, else was
there left, that could be called pleasing in
her aspectlarge, keen, black eyes,
piercing
and cold as iee, placed very near
together
,
gave an air of craft and shrewd
half-malignant cunning to features which
would otherwise have been bold and
commanding
;
her nose was almost Roman,
thin, high, and nearly fleshless; her mouth
compressed and characteristic of both
energy
and resolution. It was impossible to
look at her even for a moment without
perceiving that she must be a person of
exceedingly superior mental faculties, of
capabilities more stern and sustained, and
of an intellect more massive and imposing
than are natural to her sex; and at the
same time it was almost equally
impossible
not to believe that she must be as
deficiently
endowed with the qualities of the
heart, as she was pre-eminently
furnished
with those of the head.
There was, indeed, something more than
mere craft, and coldness, and inflexibility
of purpose written upon her keen polished
lineaments; for never stranger looked
upon her without a vague feeling of
dislike
and apprehension; a sort of intuitive
sense, that here was one of those few
beings to whom the sufferings of their
fellows
are not only wholly unimportant,
when ministering to their own
advancement
,
but are actually subjects of curiosity
and interest, and of a kind of pleasurable
excitement.
The other was an extremely beautiful
girl of about eighteen or nineteen years,
in every respect the very opposite of the
lady I have described; for she was rather
tall, and though her waist was
symmetrical
and round, her figure and bust were
unusually developed and voluptuous. She
was a blonde, too, as decidedly as her
mother
was a brunette, with a profusion of
luxuriant light brown hair, scarcely
restrained
about her temples by a broad
blue ribbon bandeau, and falling down her
neck and over her shoulders in heavy
silken masses of waving ringlets. Her
eyes were of the very darkest blue, almost
violet colored, with eyebrows slightly
curved, and long lashes, dark as night,
giving an air of character and decision to
her face, which is usually wanting in very
fair beauties.
The expression, too, was very-fine and
prepossessing; there was mind enough
visible in every lineament to counteract
everything voluptuous or sensual; while
there was not too much to be perfectly
compatible with that softness, that
predominance
of the affectionate and tender
feelings, that superiority of the
imaginative
to the reasoning faculties, which we
desire to see in a woman. She looked,
in short, such as Wordsworth has so
beautifully
painted the ideal of her sex
On a nearer view,
A spirit, yet a woman too,
With thoughts sublime and fancies free,
And steps of virgin liberty;
A creature not too bright or good
For human nature's daily food,
For gentle censures, pleasing wiles,
Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.
The breakfast table at which they were
still seated, although they had finished
their slender meal, was very differently
arranged from the modest breakfasts of
these degenerate days; for although there
were chocolate and coffee, and dry toast,
and bread in many forms, there were
flasks of red and white wine also, and
highly seasoned ragouts, and roast
wildfowl
,
and fruits, and pastry in abundance.
And not these only, for on a second table
were displayed a huge sirloin of beef, a
boar's head from the black forest, and an
enormous venison pasty, flanked by their
regular companion, a vast silver tankard
mantling with toast and ale. None of
these, however, had they partaken of,
limiting themselves to the fresh fruit, and
dry toast, and frothing chocolate; and
they were now loitering at the board,
waiting for the appearance of the master
of the house, who had been thus
unwontedly
detained.
At last the sound of the front door,
clapping heavily after the visitor, showed
them that the detention was at an end, and
at the next moment Sir Henry Davenant
walked past the window, and seeing the
ladies, raised his hat and bowed very low.
The blood rushed to the fair face of the
younger lady and she said at once, with
the ingenuous frankness which was one
of her most remarkable characteristics
Oh! I declare it is that odious man,
Sir Henry Davenant. I am sorry that he
has been here, for he always leaves my
father restless and ill at ease. I suppose
it is very wrong of me, she added,
laughing
,
but I do really almost hate the
man.
Aye! indeed it is very wrpng, and,
what is worse, very ridiculous, and even
childish. He is the ablest and most rising
young man of his party, and exceedingly
clever, well-read, and witty. There is not
a man more courted by society, or one
more sure to achieve greatness, replied
her mother. But I have long given up
all hopes of ever seeing you rational or
like the rest of the world, with your
perpetual
whims and prejudices.
I know all that you say, madam,
answered
the girl; and it is all quite true;
he is very clever, and witty, and wise too,
I dare say, and sometimes he entertains
me in spite of myself, and I almost begin
to like him. And then most likely he
commences some odious tirade against
the existence of honesty or honor among
men, and of faith or affection among
women
,
and looks at me with that strange
fascinating eye, as if he were reading
every thought in my bosom, and that
dark sneering smile which makes every
word he utters, how seriously and
solemnly
soever, seem like a sarcasm or a
mockery. It is as if he were always
ridiculing
one!
Most likely he is, replied her mother;
most likely he is always ridiculing you;
for indeed, my dear Fanny, you are most
thoroughly ridieulous, with your
romantic
and Utopian fancies, I do wish I
could see you growing a little rationala
little practicalbut I grow sick of
wishing
.
Well, mother mine, replied the girl
laughing, I am very sorry for it; but I
cannot help it, I do assure you. I cannot
like the society, or listen patiently to the
conversation of men whose every action,
every word, proves so clearly that they
are altogether heartless and hollow.
Heartless!cried the elder lady with
a harsh and bitter sneerheartless!
what, prithee, dost thou know about
hearts, minion? But here comes my lord,
take care that you anger him not with
your nonsense, Fanny.
But of this there was little danger, for
to do him justice he was at all times a
good-natured man, and especially a kind
father; and now he wore his face dressed
in its brightest garb of smiles, and was
evidently in one of his most complacent
moods.
We waited breakfast for you awhile,
my lord, said the unconscious
marchioness
,
but your good friend Sir Henry de
tained you so long that we were forced to
begin for very hunger. But Fanny will
ring for hot chocolate in a moment.
Sir Henry brought you good news, I
am sure, dear father, cried Lady Fanny,
speaking in the same breath with her
mother, and springing forward to meet
her favorite parentfor if he were
pompous
and a dullard, he was affectionate
nevertheless, and kind hearted, and proud
of his children. What is it? what is it,
dear father?
Nothing that makes much difference
to thee, Fan, he replied with a tender
smile, as the beautiful girl threw her arms
about his neckthough it will to thy
brother!and for a moment his heart
smote him for the thought lie had begun
to entertain against her future peace of
mind. Then turning towards his wife he
added
Yes. Davenant did bring me pleasant
tidings. His majesty has been pleased in
the most gracious manner, quite
unsolicited
moreover, to revive in my person the
dormant Marquisate of Beverley. There
will be a levee and a drawing room on
Wednesday of next week, at which you
will of course be present to kiss hands.
A marquisa marquis!are you
indeed
,
father? I am so gladso glad!
because I know you wish itexclaimed
the lively beauty, clasping her hands
together
and
then dear Arthur will be an
earl; will he not? and have a seat in the
Peers, during your lifetime; and he is sure
to distinguish himself, he is so clever.
I don't know about that, Fan, replied
the marquis; the title he will have of
course, by courtesy at leastbut whether
he will be called to the Peerage is more
doubtful.
And as he spoke, he sat down and
helped himself largely to a
salmi
of teal,
which had been kept smoking hot over a
silver chafing dish, and to a large goblet
of Bordeaux wine. But gratified
although
his wife was by the
announcement
,
whose spirit was no less ambitious
and far-reaching than it was shrewd and
piercing, she looked at him steadily, as
he applied himself to the good things
which he so sincerely loved, and became
certain as she gazed, that there was
something
yet behind. She turned towards her
daughter then, and said in the most
natural
and unconstrained voice in the world,
Frances, my dear, I thought you had
promised to visit your cousin, Lady
Serena
Fortescue, this morning! You can
have my chair if you wish it, and
Meredith
can follow you with two of the
running
footmen; I cannot endure, child, that
you should suffer these unpuactual habits
to grow upon you.
I will go, then, immediately, said the
fair girl, tripping lightly across the room;
but as she reached the door which opened
on the gland stairease, she nodded her
head, and smiled, saying to herself, A
gentle hint once again, that I am
de trop!
and rather a transparent hint too, for my
lady, who generally laps such things up
pretty thoroughly. Just as if she cared a
rush whether I go to Serena's at twelve of
the clock, or earlier. But I will go to her
I will gofor she is a good girl, and I
love her dearly. Heigho! I wonder why
I feel so sad this lovely morning. A
sudden
chill seemed to run through my very
heart, when I saw that cold-blooded
serpent
Davenant sneer as he passed the
window. I hope it was not ominous
but no! no! I am not superstitious!
The moment she left the breakfast room,
the marchioness looked full into her
husband's
face, and said, Well, my lord
well! what elsewhat more have you
got to tell me? and what is the price of
this?
Why, is not this enough! is not this
more, Adeliza, than we could hope for, or
expect, under a ministry who have not
hitherto seemed very friendly?
That is not what I asked you,
answered
the lady very sharply, I asked
you what more you expected, and what
price you had paid for this?
Price! price! my lady! replied the
new marquis, in his most dignified and
stately manner, how can you think of
anything so disgraceful, or speak of it in
so coarse a manner, my dear lady?
Yes, price, my lord marquis, I said
price!
Everything has its name; and
the name of the pledge, or promise, or
vote, or concession, or whatever else you
gave the ministry for this title, is its
price!
Now, then, I saw just now in your eye
that you wished to consult me about
something or other. I dare say it is not
of the slightest consequence! and if that
is the case, or if you have changed your
mind, I will go my way, and get my
tatting
but
if you mean to speak, speak
plainlyfor you are not exactly a sphinx,
to propound riddles; nor do I desire to be
the dipus to unravel yours, which I
think would be rather unperspicuous than
otherwise.
The cruel sarcasm of her tone and
manner
,
even had her words been less bitter,
would have been enough to hinder any
but the weakest of men, and most
domineered
of husbands from replying; but it
had no such effect on the marquis, long
used to hear and obey the imperious
mandates
of his wife, whose superior
intellect
he could not but acknowledge. He
answered, therefore, and at last to the
point.
Of course I gave the ministers a
written
pledge of my adherence to their party,
and support of their measures; but no one
can presume, except you, my dear
Adeliza
,
who may do anything with impunity,
to speak of my title as the price of this,
since it was granted before my
adhesion
.
And did
you
know that it was
granted
,
Beverley?
Why, not exactly, not entirely
Davenant
did notthat is to say, my lady
That is to say, my lord, `not one
word about it?'of course you did
not; for if you had, you would not
have promised entire adherence to a
party, some of whose measures you
almost
stand pledged to oppose. But now
comes my second questionwhat more
do you expect to gain from them, as the
price of your abandoning the Protestant
interests?
The vacant stallthe garter!
marchioness
!
he answered, even more
pompously
than his wont, though he had
writhed visibly as she gave his conduct
its true appellation.
The garter, indeed! the garter! she
said, a flush of exultation beaming across
her pallid and sallow face. That is
indeed
worth playing forthat is indeed
worth an
apostasy!
But how is this? I
thought Lauderdale was to have had it?
He does aspire to it, my lady. But it
will be mine notwithstanding; or I am
much mistaken.
You generally are very much
mistaken
,
said she quietly, and then resumed,
But what is to be the price of this
what new iniquity?
Upon my soul, my lady! answered
the marquis, writhing under the
conseiousness
that all the harsh words she used
were richly merited, and at the same time
losing temper at her tauntsyou are a
most extraordinary personage; one would
think you were vexed or angry at the
very things which you constantly urge
and encourage me to do. I should like
monstrously to know whose wish it was
that I should sue for the marquisate!it
is too provoking! quite too provoking!
The lady arched up her eyebrows as he
spoke, and smiled, as was her wont, and
then answered very meekly,
Oh! never mind, my dear lord, what
sort of a personage I am. I should think
5
you must know that pretty well, by this
time; and pray do not fancy that I am
vexed, for on the contrary I am
prodigiously
delighted. Still I like calling
everything by its right name, and you
know quite as well as I dofor, though
by no means clever, you do not lack a
certain sort of plodding common sense,
which is capable of discerning right from
wrong! You know, I say, quite as well
as I do, that it is miquitous for a politician
to desert his party, and vote against his
conscience, which you are going to do,
you know, on the Irish Bill; that is to
say, so far as you have got a conscience!
Oh yes! it is certainly very iniquitous!
though at the same time it may be, and
is
very expedient; and much more
creditable
to you as a convenient husband, and
provident father, than as a public man or
a patriot; which, after all, you never
were, nor will be! But come, you have
not told me what you are to do for the
garter.
Well then, if you will have it in plain
English
To be sureto be surethat is the
only way
If you will have it, I am to bring Lord
Henry St. Maur over to our side; and
persuade him to vote the Irish Bill, which
will carry it for the ministers by a
majority
of two. It is a tie nowSt. Maur
voting in the opposition.
Excellent! excellent! exclaimed
the lady, clapping her hands joyfully
together
,
and now appearing to be really
delightedwhich you can do very
easily, by breaking off Fan's match with
Sir Edward Hale, and promising her hand
to the otherthat will buy him!of
course that will buy him!and though
Fanny can't endure him, and loves Hale
with all her heart, that can't be helped,
you know! Girls can't expect that their
whims should be gratified, when the
advancement
of their families stands directly
in the way.
It is perfectly true that the Marquis of
Beverley had resolved in his own heart to
do exactly as his wife statedthat he
knew the complete and unquestionable
truth of every word she uttered, touching
his daughter's hatred to St. Maur, and love
for Sir Edward Halein both of which
feelings he had hitherto given her his full
sanction; for, where his base and
grovelling
ambition stood not in the way of his
paternal feelings, he was a kind and
indulgent
father. It is true, likewise, that
he knew St. Maur to be worthy of the
hatred, and Hale to merit all the love
and, having well considered all these
things, he meant to sacrifice poor Fanny's
happiness without a moment's hesitation.
Still, as his wife suggested it in her
barefaced
sarcastic manner, he positively
shudderedstung to the quick by the
malicious
ingenuity with which she probed
his very soul, and held up his every vice
and meanness clearly and visibly before
his eyes. And yet she was no paradox,
that artful bitter woman. She had
deliberately
,
when a young, beautiful, clever,
and much admired girl, married the gross
and dullard earl, at the promptings of her
ambition. Almost hating herself, when
she found that the world had penetrated
and branded her motives with their right
name; and hating him to a degree that
can hardly be imagineda degree
increasing
day by day with the
mortifications
which his pompous stupidity day
by day heaped upon her, she avenged
herself to the utmost of her powers
perpetually
driving him on to the commission
of fresh meannesses, so as to gratify that
ambition, which she now only lived for;
and constantly tormenting him by
exhibiting
those meannesses to himself in the
most odious light. Having herself
smothered down and stifled in her bosom
a sincere and honorable passion for a
young man who, though poor and of
small pretension when she abandoned
him for his dull titled rival, had since
risen, by dint of worth and talents only,
to high rank and power, she could not
even think of prosperous and happy love
without disgust and fury. Disliking her
own daughter, because she felt her to be
equal to herself in intellectual parts, and
superior in all other qualitiesjealous of
her, because she perceived how popular
she was in all societyfearful of her,
because
she felt that her own baser essence
must naturally be revealed by the test of
her purer spirit, as Satan's at the touch of
Ithuriel's lancethis bad and unnatural
wife and mother almost rejoiced that,
while advancing her own narrow and
morbid ambition, she was torturing the
guilty conscience of her lord, and
breaking
the heart of her too virtuous and
charming daughter.
The marquis, I say, positively
shuddered
,
as she revealed to him his own future
intentions and their consequence; and he
was silent a minute or two before he
answered
Poor Fan! I am afraid it will grieve
her a little while at first; but young
ladies'
love-smarts are not generally very
lasting. And St. Maur is young and
handsome
,
and has far greater wealth than
Hale, and title alsoI daresay she will be
very happy.
I daresay, answered his wife, with
another sneer. Fanny's mind is just of
the sort most likely to be captivated by
money, which she calls drossand title
which you have often heard her style
tinsel
!
Do not you think so? And then as
St. Maur never keeps less than three or
four mistresses, and is the most confirmed
gambler in London, and drinks, they say,
frightfully, and has a most infernal temper
he shot his favorite horse in the park the
other day, with his servant's pistol,
because
it shied from a passing carriage!
On all these accounts, I say, he is very
likely, I think, to make her happy. But
as it must be done, there is no use in
troubling ourselves about it. How do you
purpose to proceed?
I thought of writing to St. Maur to
inform
him that we have thought better of
the addresses he paid to Lady Frances
Asterly, and that were it not for his
unfortunate
opposition to my party, especially
on the Irish Bill, we should rejoice to
receive
him as our son-in-law!
Upon my word, Marquis, you
improve
you
grow quite diplomatic. Yes,
that will do very well, for as Henry is not
scrupulous, and is very much in love with
Fan's pretty figure, and has not an iota of
principle, he will doubtless chop about
like a weathercock, in less time than it
takes to talk about it. But how will you
get on with Fanny?
I shall merely tell her that I have
changed my mind, and that she must
marry St. Maur.
Then she will merely tell you that she
will do nothing of the kind, and she will
keep her word, too, as she always does.
That will never do, my lordnever
never!
How then? I do not see how else it
can be managed.
She must be made to think Edward
Hale faithless to hertold of some evil
and dishonorable deeds of his, artfully
simulated, and if not true, at least,
truth-like
.
Holdwhere is St. Maur now?
Staying with Hale at Arrington
Davenant
told me so just now.
Yes! yes! I recollect he told me
himself
he was going down thither to
celebrate
a birth-day, or some such
Tomfoolery
;
and Percy Harbottle is to be there
too, and that notorious
pendable
Captain
Spencer. Let me seelet me seeI will
write myself to St. Maur and to Spencer
also to-day. They can surely either
invent
something that will do the business
with Fan; or, what would be much
better
still, lead Edward in reality to commit
some disgraceful actionto cheat at cards
or rather, for he is incapable of that, to
get drunk and play, so that they could lay
the imputation on him, or to carry off some
country wench or other. Lord! it will be
as easy, as they say, as lying, marquis!
But I forgotI beg your pardonI forgot
that you do not like to hear the names of
the things you do every day. There,
theredo not stay to answer me now;
but go away and write your letter to St.
Maur; and write it as short as you can,
do you hear, and as much to the point
and none of your honorable and virtuous
rhodomontades, I beseech of youwhich
are always ridiculous, and impose on
nobody
,
you know; because nobody in the
world believes in such things as honor or
virtue; and which would be doubly out
of place here, because St. Maur, I am sure,
would not know the meaning of the
words. There, now; why don't you go
away and do it?
Because I want to know what I shall
do with the letter, after I have written it,
my lady, answered her lord, quite
crest-fallen
,
and stripped of all his peacock
plumes of self-complacency and
pompousness
.
Bring it to me, that I may read it, first
of all, and see how many absurdities you
can contrive to squeeze into six lines, and
then enclose it in a long letter of my own
to this young hopeful. You must send a
man off with it post to-day; he can reach
Arrington to-night, and return to-morrow
morning. Benedict, the newly hired man
will do, and he must wear plain clothes,
and take care that he drop no hint whose
man he is, or whence he comes; but I
will tutor him.
And then began the marquis, in an
inquiring tone.
And then, she answered, with a
sneering accent, you can go and order
the coronets on the carriages and
harnesses
to be altered, and choose new
buttons
at the button-maker's and new
liveries
at the tailor'sbusiness just suited to
your calibre.
I have sent Anderson to do all that
two hours ago at least. Do you suppose
it possible
I crave your pardon, replied the
lady, with an air of affected blandness, I
onght not to have supposed it possible,
marquispossible, that business of real
instance or moment could banish from
your mind those nice frivolities and
frivolous
niceties which are so thoroughly
congenial
to natures as comprehensive and
politic as your own. And then, since you
have done all this, I would go, were I you,
to Master Child's, and order a new service
of gilt plate, with the proper supporters
and coronets, marquis. That will be an
amusement for you; and the old plate is
getting rather out of date. I believe it
was as old as the creation in your
grandfather's
time, who was, I think, a
Lincolnshire
grazier! But godo go, and write
the letter!
CHAPTER IV.
When
Sir Edward Hale left the meadow
of the May-pole in the manner I have
described
,
he galloped forward at three
quarters' speed of his fine brown hunter,
Eversly having some difficulty in keeping
up with him, until he reached the foot of
the western slope of the valley, where he
slackened his pace, and rode on for a
while in a deep reverie. And was it
indeed
Rose, on whom, as Hunter
insinuated
,
the young baronet cast that quick
glance, which had so nearly cost him a
heavy fall from his horse? Reader, it was
for like most youths of hot impetuous
dispositions
,
he was a passionate admirer of
female beauty; and Rose's loveliness was,
in truth, of so high an order, that it might
well have attracted the eyes even of a
colder and less inflammable nature.
She was, indeed, in face and figure, a
paragon, more fitted for the sphere of
courts, than for the simple and somewhat
hard realities of a plain country life. Her
beauty was not the mere animal beauty,
consisting chiefly of fresh coloring and
vigorous health, which marks so
freqently
the country maidenit was of a
far higher and more delicate order.
Had she been robed in unison, she
might have moved, her birth and rank
unquestioned
,
among the most magnificent
array of England's aristocracyfor she
was very tall, and though her swelling
bust and ample shoulders, and all her
lower limbs were exquisitely modelled and
developed to the most voluptuous
symmetry
,
her waist was small and tapering, and
the whole contour of her person slender
and graceful. Her arms were like
rounded
ivoryher hands, small, delicate, and
fair, as if they had been little used to any
hard or menial laborher ankles trim and
shapely, and her feet singularly little for
so full and tall a figure.
Her face, however, was yet more strik
ing than her personit was that of a clear
brunette, with but the palest flush of the
most delicate rose tinging the lustrous
darkness of her cheekher features
approached
nearly to the classic model, but
there was a trifling upward inclination in
the outlines of the well shaped thin nose,
which added a charm of archness, that
regularity
too often will be found to lack
her ponting lips were, if such a thing can
be, almost too deeply crimson; for to
nothing
that exists, of warm and soft and
sentient, could the hue of that balmy
mouth be possibly compared.
It was the eyes, however, the large, deep
lustrous eyes, of the darkest hazel, that
caught most suddenly the observation of
all who looked upon her, if it were but for
a passing momentthere was an
indescribable
fascination in those eyes, an
inexplicable
mixture of wild out-flashing
light, and soft voluptuous languor, half
amorous, half melancholy, such as is rarely
indeed seen at all, and never but in orbs
of that clear translucent brown, that is so
far more beautiful than the dull bead-like
black, or the more shallow glitter of the
blue. Her hair, of a dark sunny brown,
shining with many an auburn gloss, where
the light fell strong upon its heavy masses,
was luxuriantly abundant; falling off on
each side of her high polished forehead in
a maze of thick clustering ringlets, and
flowing down her neck, and over her
sloping
shoulders, in large and natural curls.
The dress of this fair girl was simple as
it could be; yet, perhaps, no magnificence
of garb would have so well displayed her
wondrous charms as that undecorated
garment. A low-necked frock of plain
white muslin, sitting quite close to her
bust and slender waist, with tight sleeves
reaching to the elbow, and terminating
there in ample plaited ruffles, and a long
flowing skirta little cottage bonnet of
home-made straw, with a pink ribbon to
match her silken neckerchief and sash, a
cluster of violets in the bosom of her
frock, and a nosegay in her hand, the gift
much prized that morningof the now
half-rejected lover.
Such was the choicest finery of the
village
belle, and, as I have already said, it
would have been hard indeed to deck her
comely person in anything that could
have displayed her beauties with more
advantage
.
Those were the days, in courts,
of whalebone stomachers and hoops five
fathoms in circumference; of stiff brocaded
stuffs, and powdered head-dresses; of art,
and most ungraceful art, against any touch
of nature. Grace and simplicity were
discarded
,
and every native movement, so
beautiful in its natural ease, was
hampered
and confined by every species of
ligature and bandage that the most
depraved
and artificial taste could by any
means imagine or suggest.
What wonder, then, that Edward Hale,
a passionate admirer, as he was, of female
beauty, accustomed so much to the stiff
airs and affected minanderies of starched
ladies, should have been momentarily
struck by the natural and simple
loveliness
of that fair villager, whose every turn
and motion was full of poetry, and instinct
with easy life. What wonder, then, that
when he crossed the hill, and lost sight of
the gay concourse, he should have called
the keeper up to his side, and asked him
quite abruptly
Tell me, Mark Eversley, tell me, he
said, not without a slight shade of
embarrassment
appearing in his manner, who
was that fine old silver-headed farmer who
stood close to me on the left-hand side,
when my horse reared so suddenly? There
was a tall young fellow at his elbow, with
a quarter staffFrank Hunter, I believe, if
I have not forgotten more than I think I
have. I used to ferret rabbits with him,
if it be the same, many a year ago, in the
Monk's coppice. But who was the old
farmer
,
Mark? I can't remember him.
Oh, that was Master Castleton, I think,
Sir Edward, answered the fellow, with a
cunning grin, clearly perceiving the drift
of his master's question, there was a
very pretty lass upon his arm, wasn't
there, sir?
The hot blood rushed to the browthe
ingenuous browof the young
gentleman
;
and, vexed at the bare idea that his
thoughts should be read, his secret
penetrated
by a menial, he answered hastily
Was there? I did not noticeI hardly
think there was, though; for I suppose I
should have observed her, if there had
beenseeing that I am a great admirer of
pretty faces.
I'm sure, then, you'd admire Rose's.
answered the wily keeper, for it's the
prettiest eye, and the handsomest face,
too, in all the village; and then her shape
is not behind her face, neither. But I'm
a-thinking it couldn't have been Master
Castleton, else, as you say, you must have
noticed Rose. It might have been old
Andrew
Bell, or Simon Carter, or John Hall,
they were all gathered thereabout, and
they are all grey-headed men, too.
No, no! replied the landlord, it was
not any one of these; I recollect them all
right well. It must have been old
Castleton
;
what did you call himHarry?
No. James, so please your honor;
but I don't think it could have been he,
anyhow, Sir Edward; least ways I don't
see how you could have missed observing
Rose. Why, bless you! she's the beauty
of the village; there's not a girl like her
for twenty miles around. I don't believe,
Sir Edward, you ever saw a handsomer in
London.
Well, now I think on it, I believe there
was a girla very tall girlon his arm;
dressed all in white, was she? but Oliver
reared up, just then, and that prevented
me from taking notice, I suppose. What
is she? daughter to old Castleton?
Yes, sir; and troth-plighted, they say,
to that Frank Hunter, dn him? but I
don't reckon much of that, for she's an
arrant jiltis pretty Rose. Why she kept
company with me, Sir Edward, six months
and better, and then flew off as if she was
meet for a king, when I asked her to be
my wife. I warrant me she'd fly from
Frank, there, just as sudden, so be she
could 'light on a higher or a richer
sweetheart
.
Well, well! said Hale, half angrily,
perhaps, at feeling that his servant was
tampering with thoughts that were even
then, though faintly and uncertainly, at
work in his own bosom, and not being yet
prepared to be hurried on his way
well, all that's nothing to me, Mark. But
why did you damn the young fellow,
Eversley? He used to be as fine a lad as
any in the country; and, if he did win
your sweetheart, I dare say that he won
her fairly. You should not bear a grudge,
man; all goes by luck in love and liking.
Oh! it's not that, Sir Edward, it is not
that at all! I would not now have the
girl if I could; I'm very glad he took her
off my hands, and very grateful to him for
it. I would not have her now, I'm sure,
unless it was for a mistressand that she
is not like to be for a poor fellow, whatever
she might for a born gentleman. It is not
that, at all, that made me damn him; but,
bless you! he's the biggest poacher in the
country!
Ha! is heis he? that's bad; we must
see to that. Have you got any proof
against him?
Not clearnot clear, Sir Edward; but
I keep a tight watch on him always, and
I'll be nabbing him, I warrant me, one of
these times.
Do sodo so! returned the other,
forming, almost unconsciously, a secret
feeling of dislike to the young man, who
was known as the accepted suitor of Rose
Castleton. Do so; and if we catch him
tripping badly, we can send him out of
the country, or, perhaps, get him pressed
on board the fleet; and then you can get
the pretty Rose, you know.
Oh! I don't want her, sirnot I,
returned
the keeper, I would not marry
her at all, unless I was to be well paid for
it, and then I'd marry the foul fiend if need
were.
Fie! fie! Mark! answered Hale
don't talk in that profligate manner, I
beg of you. But, tell me, where does old
Castleton live now? Your father was
saying
something to me about his lease, I
think, this morning. It has run out, I
fancy, and he wants it renewed.
Yes, yes, Sir Edward, the other
interrupted
eagerly, it
has
run out; and he
does want it renewed; but then, Sir
Edward
,
it's the home-farm, like; between
Monk's coppice and Raywood; and the
spring-brook trout pond lies in the very
middle of itall the best ground for game
in the whole manorand the best water,
too, for fishing! Now I've been thinking
that it will make bad work, if Hunter
marries Rose, and Castleton gets a new
lease. Why, bless you, sir! Frank would
not leave a feather in the woods, or a fin
in the waters, after he'd lived in the home
farm a fortnight; besides, the kennel lies
so handy; it always seemed to me the
keeper should live there. I was going to
speak to you about that myself. I should
like well to rent it; and my two brothers
could look after it, so that I would not be
kept from my duties, neither.
I'm afraid, Mark, that can't well be;
for, you see, I promised not to remove
any tenant; and, besides, old Castleton
lived there, under my grandfather, if I
remember
rightly; and has been a good
tenant, too. But I won't forget you,
Mark, never fear; for I won't forget you.
But now we must make haste, or we shall
be late at Barnsley; and, with the words,
he again put spurs to his horse, and rode
on as fast as he could gallop, until he
reached the little post-town, where he
drew bridle at the door of the next
country
inn, and called aloud to the hostler,
who came running across the court-yard
towards himasking whether Lord
Henry St. Maur and Captain Spencer had
arrived from London!
But, before the man had time to answer,
a loud burst of laughter from within
replied
;
and then a gay voice cried
Here we are, Ned; here we are; and
here have we been these two hours.
Come income in hither; quick, man, or
that rogue Percy Harbottle will finish the
cool tankard before you get a taste of it.
Our horses will be ready in a minute;
come, make haste, you must be athirst
this hot day!
Edward Hale leaped down at the jovial
summons, and flinging his rein to the
keeper, ran up the steps, and entered the
small clean parlor, to the left of the
passage
,
where he found his three friends
merrily employed in circulating a mighty
silver flagon, filled with the generous
compound of ale and sherry, sugar and
toast and spices.
Three very comely personages were
they, who occupied the solitary parlor of
the country inn; three such, indeed, as it
had probably never contained at one time
before, such that not the landlord and
landlady only, but Doll the chambermaid,
and Dick the tapster, and even fat old
drunken Deborah, the cook, had
contrived
to find something or other to do in that
parlor, in order to get a glimpse of the
handsome gentlemen from London.
They were three in number, all of
distinguished
family, and of appearance and
manners suitable to their rank, and none
of them above the middle age, though two
were scarcely beyond their boyhood.
The eldest of the three was the
notorious
Captain Spencer, a peer's second son,
the commander of a gallant frigate now in
commission, and as Lady Beverley had
truly designated him, within an hour of
the time when he was sitting there so
calm and unruffled, although he knew it
not, the most celebrated
pendable
of the
metropolis. Of tried and distinguished
courage, a good seaman for those days, a
gentleman of the most courtly and
finished
manners, the Honorable Edmund
Spencer
was perhaps as thorough a debauchee
and reprobate as existed at that day in all
England. An admirable player at all
games, a perfect musician, a very
graceful
dancer, his success among women had
been almost unparalleled; and, although
several of his adventures had been
marked
by very thorough depravity, and had
terminated miserably for his fair victims,
still fair and virtuous and innocent and
noble women were found to smile upon
the cold-hearted seducer, while they had
not one tear to shed for the hapless
beings
he had brought down to shame and
misery and untimely death.
With men, his ready wit, his liberality,
his frankness, and his courage, made him
even more generally a favorite than he
was with the softer sex. The very
boldness
of his vice was to him a protection;
and, as it seemed, a fresh claim on the
world's admiration. No subterfuge had
ever sullied his character for truth
whatever
wrong he did to any one, he avowed
it openly, and gave honorable
satisfaction
.
He had shot one husband dead, and
desperately wounded two brothers,
fighting
to avenge wife's and sister's reputation.
An honorable man
par excellence
was the
Honorable Edmund Spencer. Yet many
a better man had expiated his crimes on
the gallows.
Spencer was at this time about
forty-three
years old, although no person would
have suspected him of being nearly that
age; he was extremely handsome, though
of a dark and somewhat saturnine
complexion
,
with a full bright black eye, an
aquiline nose, and one of the most
fascinating
smiles that ever wreathed a lip in
blandishment. His hair, black as the
raven's
wing, and without one speck or line
of grey, was exquisitely soft and glossy,
and almost as redundant in its fall of
natural
tresses as the huge wigs of the day.
His voice was silvery music, and by long
habit he had learned to modulate his
accents
like the tones of a delicate
instrument
.
For the young of both sexes never was
created an enemy more dangerous than
Edmund Spencer. In the slightest glance
of his eye there lurked wily fascination
in the most trivial word he uttered there
was a covert meaninga concealed
power! But his smile, his caress, his
friendship, or his love, were ruinutter,
inevitable ruin!
His dress, although in some degree
professional
,
was rich and magnificent; for
at that period a gentleman could be
recognised
by his distinctive garb alone, from
his valet. He wore a coat, cut in the
naval form, with the open sleeves of the
period, showing from the elbow to the
wrist the shirt sleeves of plaited lawn
fringed with ruffles of superb
Valenciennes
lace. It was of dark blue cloth, long
waisted and broad skirted, lined
throughout
with white sarcenet. His breeches
were of blue velvet, and his vest of the
same color, both slashed with white silk,
and adorned with many buttons of solid
gold, embossed with the crown and
anchor
.
He wore high boots and spurs,
having travelled thither on horseback,
being, rather an uncommon thing for a
sailor, a perfect and graceful cavalierhis
hat, with a band of feathers, and a short
crooked hanger lay on the table near
him.
Lord Henry St. Maur, who was standing
up with his back to the fire-place, now
filled with green and May-flowers,
instead
of its winter decoration of sea coal,
was a tall, slight, fair young man, with
nothing particular in his appearance,
unless
it were a mixed expression of
licentiousness
and audacity, which ill became
his beardless lip, and smooth, effeminate
features. He was dressed far more
splendidly
than the sea captain, in a full suit of
maroon colored velvet, lined and slashed
with philomot satin, and decorated with
large ribbon shoulder knots of the same
color. He had much costly lace at his
bosom and wrists; the buttons of his coat
and his knee buckles and sword hilt
glittered
with brilliantly cut steel; and to
complete the picture, a huge fleece of
curls, the natural hue of which was
disguised
by a profusion of reddish marechal
powder, fell down over his shoulders, and
impregnated the whole atmosphere of the
inn-parlor with musk and ambergris, and
Heaven knows what besides.
Percy Harbottle, the third of the
company
,
was the youngest likewise, and the
least worthy of notice, though perhaps
the most worthy to be esteemed a
gentleman
.
He was good-looking, and
good-humored
;
and, though by no means a fool,
certainly neither a genius nor a witin a
word, he was a frank, lively,
generous-hearted
,
rash, impetuous young man,
likely
enough to be hurried by evil association
into the contracting of bad habits, and of
committing follies, or becoming subject
to the more venial vicesbut kindly at
the same time, and honorable if
unthinking
.
In fact, he was a type of that large class
of youths at all times floating like the froth
on the top of that great syllabubthe
social
world!whom every one pronounces
an excellent good fellow, without being
able in the least degree to specify wherein
their excellence consistswhose greatest
merits are good looks and animal
good-humor
,
and whose greatest demerit is a want
of ballast, of stability of character, and
singleness
of purpose, without which a man
may be agreeable, but cannot possibly be
great.
Such was Percy Harbottleand there
be many Percy Harbottles around us
everywhere
who,
exquisitely, and rather
coxcombically attired in light blue silk,
laced with gold, and bewigged and
bepowdered
to the very acme of the mode,
was, at the moment of Sir Edward's
entrance
,
apparently justifying the
apprehensions
of the others concerning the
contents
of the tankard, by the prodigious
draught which he was making on its racy
mixture. He sent it down, however, and
drawing a long breath, as Hale came in,
jumped up with a good deal of eagerness,
and with his hand extended, to meet him.
Spencer arose also, and put out his
hand; but though there was much elegance
and grace in every motion, though his
tones were perfect harmony, and his
words not well chosen only, but courteous
and even friendly, there was something
that gave the young baroneta strong
impression
of the sea-captain's
heartlessness
;
for he had known him before but
slightly, and was now receiving him
rather as a friend of his school-fellow St.
Maur, than as an intimate of his own
choosing.
The truth was, that although the
captain's
manner was exquisite, it was too
evident that it was manner onlythere
was a total want of cordiality, or warmth,
or in fact of any feeling. And, sooth to
say, it would have been very strange had
there not been that wantfor it was on
his total freedom from all touch of
genuine
nature, his complete mastery over his
strongest feelings, his absolute
impassibility
of temper, and immobility of feature,
on which Edmund Spencer prided himself
the most. He had been all his life
acquiring
itand though he had given much
pains to many fine accomplishments, to
none had he devoted half the study this
had cost him. No wonder he was perfect
in it!
St. Maur nodded, and smiled, and
thrust out a single finger, with a delicious
attempt at nonchalance. He was really
glad to see Edward Hale, whom he liked
as well as he liked anything, except
himself
;
that is to say, so far as he amused
him, and gave him no troubleand he said
he was gladbut he said it as if he was
rather sorry than otherwise. He wanted
to be easy and careless; he had heard
Spencer ridicule enthusiasm as boyish and
ladylikeand he had the greatest horror
in the world of being thought a boy; and
in endeavoring to be un-enthusiastic, one
of the
nil admirari
school, he became as
stiff as the poker, and as unnatural and
unlike
his model, whom he flattered himself
he was very closely imitating, as it is
possible to conceive.
In a few minutes, howeverfor St.
Maur's character was far too impulsive
and ill-regulated to be true to anything
even to itself, for above half an hourhe
became boisterous and noisy, and
displayed
spirits so exuberant as to justify in
some measure Perey Harbottle's assertion,
that he had only drained the tankard,
which it appeared on inspection he had
done to the very dregs, for the purpose of
preserving him from the commission of
such a solecism as to be drunk before
dinner.
Upon my life! said Spencer, I do
not feel so perfectly assured that you
were in time enough to save him, Percy!
Who will bet odds that he does not
tumble
off his horse before we reach
Arrington
?
I will, by heaven! cried St. Maur
himself; I will, in rouleaux! is it
done!
No, not exactly, answered Spencer,
laughing, not with you, my dear fellow;
for if I did, you would not drink any more
in the first place; and in the second, you
would keep yourself quiet; and, in short,
I should not be
sure
of winning.
And do you never bet, Captain
Spencer
,
asked Hale, half jesting and half
serious
,
but when you are
sure
to win?
Never, my dear sir, never, replied
Spencer, in his blandest tones, do you?
Generally, I am afraid, said Sir
Edward
,
laughing merrily.
Ah! so does Harbottle; except that
for `generally' you may read `always.'
Harbottle
always
bets when he is
not
sure
to win; or, in other words, when he
is
sure to lose. He pays too, which is
something
in these days. Harbottle is an
undeniable
man to bet with. I bet with him
myself a good deal.
Nothing could, indeed, be more strictly
true than this last assertion of the gallant
captain, to whose gentlemanlike
necessities
Percy Harbottle's betting-book
annually
ministered, to the tune of a cool
thousand
,
at the least reckoning. A more
cunning
and less artful man than he would
have shunned the topic and been detected
by his silence. Spencer knew better, and
talking of it openly, those who knew it to
be true scarcely believed it, and those
who were not certain utterly scouted the
idea.
For a few minutes after this, the young
men conversed merrily and gaily of fifty
trivial incidents which had occurred since
their last meeting; and light jokes called
forth lighter laughter; as for the most part
is the case when the gay-hearted and the
cheerful, over whose head time has not
shed a single sorrow, meet after passing
absence. But by-and-by the replenished
tankard was once again exhausted, and
the young comrades soon began to lack
some newer and more keen excitement.
Come, come, cried Edward Hale,
let us get, all of us, to horse, and ride,
as quickly as we may, back to the manor.
There is a kind of merry-making of the
villagersa May-day frolic on the green;
and, as it is my birth-day too, I was
obliged
to promise the good people there that
I would join their sports; and, what is
more, to ask them all to dine with me at
noon, under a tent. I am afraid it will be
but a tedious sort of merriment to you, my
boys, after the gaieties of London; but we
must make the best of it; and, to
compensate
for it, we'll sup at eight, when all is
over, and try my father's choice old
Burgundy
.
Ods-life! cried St. Maur, there will
be nothing tedious in it so far as I'm
concerned
;
for, I doubt not, you have store of
pretty lasses here among your tenantry?
and if we are to pass the summer here
with you, you know, we must look out
for something in the shape of
bona robas
to while away the time before the
shooting
season.
Well, well, Lord Harry, you shall see
all of them, I promise, answered the
baronet
,
with a quick meaning smile; but
then it must be honor bright. You shall
have every help from me in
your
amours,
but then you must not interfere with
mine
hey, St. Maur?
Hark to himhark to him, Spencer;
hark to him, Harbottle! cried the young
lord, laughing; did you, in all your lives,
did you ever hear such a Turk? Why,
he only came down hither last night, for
the first time these sixteen years, and the
dog has cut out an intrigue already!
Oh, I don't wonder at it, not I, in the
least, Harbottle answered; the fellow
always had the eye of a hawk for a pretty
wench, and the devil's own luck in
winning
them, too. Don't you remember, St.
Maur, how he tricked Neville, at Christ
Church, out of his black-browed Julia,
after two days' acquaintance, when
Neville
had been better than six months in
bringing her to reason?
And Neville such a lady-killer, too!
lisped St. Maur; but I suppose we had
better promise him.
To be sure, to be sure we had!
answered
the other in a breath, for if he
has got the least start in the world with
the girl, we have no more chance of her
than the merest bumpkin in the country
So it's a bargain, Hale, continued St.
Maur; you will give each of us the best
of your countenance and assistance,
provided
we keep all due distance from your
own dulcinea.
A bargain! answered the young
baronet
;
and a bargain! a bargain!
chimed in his gay, licentious comrades.
And now, Sir Edward, inquired
Spencer, gravely, after they had mounted,
and galloped a few hundred yards from
the inn door, what is your wench's
name, that we may have no mistake
here? and what does she look like?
Her name is Rose Castleton,
answered
Sir Edward Hale, the hot blood
rushing hurriedly to his brow and cheek,
as he named her, against whose peace
and honor the wild words of his reckless
and unprincipled companions had almost
instantaneously matured his vague
thoughts into violent designs.
Her name is Rose Castleton; and she
is likesimply the most beautiful woman
it ever was my luck to gaze upon. The
finest and most voluptuous figurethe
brightest and most sparkling facethe
most luxuriant hairthe softest and most
passionate eye! By heaven! the
loveliest
girl I ever yet have looked upon
were but a foil to her transcendant
beauties
!but
let us hurry on our way, or we
shall be too late!
And, at the word, they gave the rein to
their good steeds, and touched their sleek
sides with the spur, and no one could
have found fault with the pace thereafter,
till they came to the hill which overlooked
the vale of Arrington.
CHAPTER IV.
No further words were spoken by the gay
companions; for, indeed, the fiery rate
at which the cavaliers spurred on towards
the manor, precluded the possibility of
conversationthe thick beating clang of
their horses' hoofs on the country road
drowning all words pitched in tones
lower than a shout.
It was, indeed, a charminga delicious
morning; the soft south wind which
fanned their brows and fluttered their
hair, as they cut through it rapidly, came
laden with the fresh odor of the new
mown hay, and the mingled perfumes of
a thousand wild flowers; for all the
hedge-row
banks were studded, as thickly as
the parterres of a well kept garden, with
primroses and cowslips, and dark
clustering
violets,the scent of which
pervaded
the whole atmosphere. The tall
hedges, bordering the road on either
hand, with their green buds just bursting
into leaf, were actually sheeted with
white bloom; while many a brier rose
flaunting with its red blossoms, and many
a honey-suckle hung its rich clusters
over brake and thicket.
Myriads of larks were pouring their
clear merry notes into the cool air, as they
floated far beyond the reach of human
vision, at the very gates of Heaven; one
soaring upward as another dropped, faint
and exhausted with the sweetness of his
own melody, to repose himself on the
fresh greensward, and meditate another
hymn.
Everything in the sounds and sights of
nature, that spoke to the senses of the
young men, was pleasant and
exhilarating
;
and from a distance, as if to swell
the chorns of general rejoicing, the chime
of a village church came pealing down
the wind with notes, as it were, of
mirthful
invitation. Their hearts, too, were
glad and jocund; no selfish thoughts, or
interested motives, were at that time alive
within bosoms too generally the slaves to
such evil feelings. They had come down
into the free, blithe country to divest their
spirits of the cares and half toilsome
pleasures, the din and rivalry, the jealousy
and turmoil of the great city; and having
come they were prepared and willing to
be pleased with almost everything.
After they had galloped a few miles on
their road, the lane which they had
followed
hitherto turned off almost at right
angles to the left hand, another pathway
coming in from the opposite direction.
Here the young baronet pulled up his
horse, and pointing straight forward, over
a high wattled fence, dividing a large
pasture field from the highway, he called
out
That is our nearest way, gentlemen,
by three miles; and over as pretty a line
of country as you ever rode across.
There is not one ploughed field or
meadow
in the range; all good firm pasture
land, with fair stand-up fences, and one
ten foot brooknothing more; what do
you say to a lark?
By all means! by all means! cried
St. Maur, giving his horse the spur, and
sweeping over the fence cleverly; which
is the way?
Straight for the tall oak tree on the
hill, in the third hedge-row; thence
you will see the top of the old castle
on my grounds; steer straight for that,
boys!
And away they went, with whoop and
halloa, skimming the bright green fields,
and swinging over the easy fences with
scarce an effort of their mettlesome and
high-bred horses. It was not long,
however
,
before the headlong pace at which
they rode brought them to the summit of
the hills commanding the scene which has
been heretofor described; and so
extraordinary
was the beauty of that scene,
with its tranquil landscape, and gay
grouping, that the three guests of the
young lord of the manor pulled up, as it
were by a common impulse, their hot
horses, and uttered a simultaneous
expression
of surprise and admiration.
Is that your place? By Heaven! you
are a luckier fellow than I fancied, Ned,
cried St. Maur.
Give us your hand, old boy; long may
you live to enjoy this fair manor! said
Harbottle, yet more cordially.
By the Lord! what a lovely picture.
A Poussin in the distance, and a Teniers
merry-making in the foreground, added
Spencer, looking at the view with a
painter's
eye, for he was indeed no mean
connoisseur
in that delightful art.
It is a fine old place, Hale answered,
gratified much by the pleasure of his
friends and college comrades; but come
along, and you shall see the place and its
inhabitauts more nearly.
And, with the words, he again touched
his horse with the spur, and galloped
lightly down the slope, and across the
greensward of the common, towards a
large and gaily decorated tent, with
several flags and streamers fluttering in
the summer air above it, which had been
erected during his temporary absence, at
a short distance from the May-pole.
About the entrance of this grand marquee,
a dozen or more of Sir Edward's servitors
were clustered, and flinging his rein to
the foremost of these as he alighted, he
bade the others look to the horses of his
friends, and lead them to the stables of the
manor.
Loud rang the plaudits of the tenantry,
as the young master of their destinies,
accompanied
by his distinguished looking
friendsfor they were all finely made and
handsome men, and all, as I have said,
superbly dressed in the rich mode of the
day, with gold embroideries, and rich lace,
and fluttering shoulder-knots, and waving
featherswalked through the merry
throng, now pausing for a moment to
shake hands with some sturdy yeoman,
whom he remembered as his play-fellow
of yore; now listening to the tedious, but
not, for that, insincere or unwelcome
gratulations
of some hoary-headed farmer;
now giving brief directions to his steward
or serving men concerning the ale butts to
be broached, and the ox to be roasted
whole by noon; now chucking some
bright-cheeked demure looking damsel
under the chin, with a light laugh; till all
pronounced him the most affable and
kindest-hearted landlord in the county,
and augured years of peace and comfort
under his patriarchal sway.
But it was acting allsheer acting!
natural acting indeed, and such as might
have imposed on the shrewdest judge of
human nature; and for this reasonthat
Edward Hale but enacted, at that time,
what would have been his own
instinctive
,
natural conduct at another, had his
mind been at ease, and his thoughts
disengaged
;
and even while he was thus
acting, he was almost if not entirely
unconscious
of the fact; for he was not a
hypocritenot even a dissembler,
though full many a gay licentious vice
might have been laid with justice to his
charge, he never had committed any very
serious, or at least any premeditated wrong
and was not, in the least degree, a
hardened
or habitual sinner. But now all the
worse portions of his nature were aroused
within him.
Voluptuous by nature, and not, perhaps,
disinclined to sensuality, his attention had
been struck at first sight by the singular
beauty of Rose Castleron; and a keen,
although
vague desire of possessing her had
occupied his mind for a moment. A little
thought, however, had quickly brought
him back to his better senses; and while
he was thus fluctuating between the
influences
of his good and evil genii, a single
admonition from a wise and sincere friend
would have drawn the black drop from
his heart. But in the place of the sage
adviser
,
Edward had met the tempter. The
question which he asked of his ill-disposed
gamekeeper, in curiosity, and from the
want of any other interesting topic, had
been so answered by that artful man as to
inflame the nascent passions of his
master
;
and, by creating a doubt of Rose's
mental purity, to palliate to his mind the
offence which he soon began to meditate
against her.
Twofold was the design of Eversley
first, and most prominently, he desired, by
basely pandering to the evil qualities of
the young baronet, to gain such an
ascendency
over his mind as might contribute
to his own advancementsecond, to
wreak his vengeance on a girl who had
rejected his addresses, and on the man
who had won the love of her whom he
once courted. With his heart burning yet
at the hints and instigations of that bad
servant, he had been thrown into the
whirl and vortex of licentious merriment
which characterized the conversation of
his companions; and thus his passions
were excited, and his dormant vanity
aroued, until by degrees he worked
himself
into a resolute determination to make
Rose Castleton his victim and his
mistress
.
It was on this account that he walked
with an absent mind among his shouting
peasantry; uneasy that he could not
discover
the object of his burning passion,
and unwilling to inquire her whereabouts,
lest he should prematurely wake
suspicion
.
Suddenly, as he passed the May-pole,
and neared the hawthoru bush and
pastoral
throne beneath it, his glad eye fell
upon the rustic beauty. She had been
chosen Queen of the May, and sat on high,
surrounded by the prettiest of the village
maidens, upon the grassy seather bright
eye sparkling even more brightly than its
wont, with gratified ambitionher dark
cheek flushed with the quick lustre of
successful vanity.
A crown of gorgeous flowers had now
supplanted the humble cottage bonnet,
and many a dewy bud was mingled with
her long curled tresses; the modest
kerchief
that had veiled her sloping shoulders
and fair neck was gone, and was but
insufficiently
replaced by a gay wreath
which crossed her bosom like a baldric
and twined around her waist A tall
white lily, meet sceptre for so beautiful a
queen, graced her right hand, as with
young artless mirth she issued her
commamds
to the blithe crowd around her.
Why does her cheek so suddenly turn
palewhy flush to so hot a crimson?
Alas! poor maid! her eye met Edward
Hale's, as he drew nigh, and again noted
the strong and passionate expression of
delighted admiration, which it had noted
once before. And yet she loved Frank
Hunterardently, truly loved him! And
yetand yetoh woman! woman! well
said the great Magician of the North,
noting
thy changeful mood, well did he paint
thee
In hours of ease
Fantastic, way ward, hard to please
for thou, Rose Castleton, lovingmost
truly and most singly lovingFrank
Hunter
,
and caring nothing for Sir Edward, all
for a poor brief triumph of thy sex's
passion
,
and therewithal to punish Frank for
his short jealous fit that morning, didst
meet the eye of the young baronet, with
that half bold, half bashful glance of thine
half innocent, half consciousthat made
him fancy thee half won alreadymade
him strain every nerve to win thee.
Fair face and graceful form, and
eloquence
so warm and wily, as never
peasant
maiden listened to without dread
peril, and rare skill in the mazes of the
dance, and sumptuous garb, and dignity,
and rank! Beware! beware! Rose
Castleton
.
All day he danced with her upon the
green; his gay companions selecting for
their partners the prettiest three of her
attendant
nymphs, and, like Sir Edward,
monopolizing them the live-long day
and at the noonday feast she sat beside
him, her little heart high fluttering with
vanity and pleasure and ambition.
She had listened to his vows of love,
how delicately syllabled to her fond
foolish
earhis arms had been about her
waisthis lips had snatched a kiss before
they partedand she had promised too
promised to meet him in the Monk's
coppice
,
ere the moon set the following night
and yet, weak fool! she dreamed not
that she did any real wrongand laid the
flattering unction to her soul, that she
would forgive Frank soonwhen she had
made him soundly jealous. Beware! Rose
Castleton, beware! Heaven succor thee!
or thou art but a lost one!
CHAPTER VI.
The
moon rose bright and broad behind
the castle hill, and poured its full flood of
lustre over the tented meadow, whereon
the revels and the dances of the yeomanry
were still kept up with unabated spirit,
long after the young lord of the manor
and his guests had retired from the scene
of sylvan merriment.
Meanwhile, a ruddy light began to
shine out of the oriel windows of the old
hall, showing that mirth and gaiety
maintained
their empire within, as steadily as
without the hospitable walls of the
proprietor
.
The supper room was a fine old
fashioned
chamber, wainscoted and ceiled with
dark English oak, polished so brightly that
the walls reflected every object almost as
distinctly as a crystal mirror. The
monotony
of the black woodwork was relieved
by a rich cornice, round the summit of
the walls, of flowers and fruits and
arabesques
,
highly gilt and burnished; the
surbase and the panels were surrounded
with workmanship of the same kind, as
were the posts and lintels of the doors, the
chimney-piece, and the frames of several
large Venetian looking-glasses that hung,
one in each angle of the room, which was
an oblong ocragon, reaching from the
floor to the roof. The floor, where it was
not covered by a fine Turkey carpet, was
polished till it was as bright and almost as
slippery as ice; the curtains and the
furniture
were of ruby colored velvet, laid
down with broad gold lace; and, when it
is taken into consideration that there were
above fifty large wax lights in lamps and
chandeliers of cut glass with many
pendants
,
so disposed in every part of the
hall that it was nearly as light as day,
nothing
could easily be imagined more grand
and striking in the shape of decoration.
The table was spread with its
snow-white
drapery, and a profusion of cut
glass and silver glittered upon the board,
while the long necks of several flasks of
champagne and Bordeaux, protruding
from the massive coolers, showed that
due preparation had been made to gratify
the palate, as well as to delight the eye.
Supper was served, and so well was the
household of the young baronet organized,
that all the guests were loud and sincere
in their commendation of his wines, his
cookery, his whole menage; and Spencer,
the fastidious spoiled child of the world,
privileged to find fault with anything at
will, whispered aside to St. Maur that his
country friend was by no means to be
despised
as an Amphitryon, and
immediately
challenging Sir Edward to drink
champagne with him, told him aloud in
his significant, blunt-seeming manner,
that it would not be his fault if he did
not become an
habitu
at his housefor
that his bill of fare was as undeniable as
Harbottle's betting book.
It must not be supposed, however, that
on this, the first evening of the young heir's
majority, he sat down with his three
guests alone to supper. Far from itthe
board was laid with more than twenty
covers, and all the landed aristocracy of
the county were assembled to celebrate
the birth-day, and welcome the arrival of
their young neighbor.
Some few of these were men of the
world and gentlemen in the highest sense
of the word, the venerable Earl of
Rochefort
and his three noble sons being among
the number.
The greater part of the company,
however
,
with the exception of one or two
clergymen
,
consisted of country gentlemen, as
country gentlemen of that dayfor it is of
the time of the last of the unhappy Stuarts
that I am writingwere almost to a man
that is to say, mere boorish and
unlettered
sportsmen, staunch riders after stag
and fox from sunrise to mid-day; staunch
topers at the bottle or the bowl, from
afternoon
to midnight!
It had not been deemed wise, or in any
sense advisable, to omit this class of
neighbors
,
for many reasons; not that Sir
Edward
had the least idea either of becoming
one of their number in reality, or of
affecting
to do so for the sake of gaining their
votes; for he entertained no thought of
standing for the county, even at a future
period; nor, had he done so, would he
have condescended, therefore, to any
indirection
.
Something of this sort he slightly hinted
to the old peer who sat on his right, while
apologizing for the rather uproarious mirth
which soon began to prevail at the lower
end of the table; but the good old man
smiled slightly as he answered
You do not owe me the least apology,
my dear Sir Edward; since all these
gentlemen
are occasionally guests of mine,
likewise, at the castle; and several of them,
though somewhat rough and unpolished,
are very estimable men in their way; good
landlords and good neighborsupright and
charitable, and true English heartsproud
to the proud and kindly to the poor. It
may be they are a little addicted to elevating
trifles, which are well enough in their way,
into the serious occupation of a life-time.
But, after all, I do not know which of us
all is free from this weakness! and it is at
least more venial to pass a life-time in
hunting foxes, than in misgoverning
nations
,
merely for pastime.
I agree with you perfectly, my lord,
said Hale, and am glad to find that you
do not altogether disapprove offox-hunting,
as I must confess myself rather fond of it
and believe I shall sometimes join my
neighbors when the season comes.
Disapprove of itoh no! said the
earl, laughing, so far from that, I was
very near determining to set up a pack
myself some years since, when your
respected
father died, Sir Edwarda loss
which you were too young to feel at that
timeand I should probably have done so,
had not our friend, Sir Willoughby de
Willoughby
,
whom I see you have made your
vice-president for the day, undertaken
them. Oh, no! I think hunting an
admirable
,
bold, and manly exercise, tending to
hinder our young men from degenerating
into mere city coxcombs, or singing,
dancing
dilettanti
, like the noblesse of Italy
I mean of course, if it be not abused. No,
no! indeed; I think there are many
pursuits
more blameble than hunting, and
many associates, too, more dangerous than
fox-hunters!
And, as he spoke the words, his eye
dwelt for a moment on the handsome face
of Capt. Spencer, whose character he
knew thoroughly well by reputation; and
whom he was extremely sorry to see on
terms of intimacy with a young man, to
whom, on many accounts, he wished well;
and of whom he was disposed, on a very
short acquaintance, to think highly.
Sir Edward's eye followed the transient
glance; and, as he thought he had
detected
a hidden allusion to himself and his
guests, the ingenuous blood rushed
crimson
to his frank face, and he remained for
a moment or two absent and embarrassed.
This was not, however, noticed by the old
nobleman, for he had not made the
observation
with reference to Spencer, although
the fitness of it struck him the moment he
had spoken; and, not wishing to assume
the monitor, or to interfere in the affairs of
others, he had cast his eyes upon his plate,
and appeared to be busy only in
apportioning
the condiments to his wild fowl.
The direction of the earl's eye had not,
however, been unnoticed by St. Maur, who,
though he did not catch the words uttered,
had no doubt, as he saw the glance
followed
by his host's embarrassment, that
something had been said in
disparagement
of his friend. Nothing occurred,
however, at the moment, although a
sentiment
of dislike was implanted in St. Maur's
breast, which he evinced afterwards by
taking
every opportunity of holding up the
old lord to ridicule, as a fanatic and half
fool; and of quizzing his sons behind their
backs unmercifully, as milksops and
twaddlers
,
scarce one shade better than the
country bumpkins round about them.
Conversation, except among the few
persons
at the head of the table, was soon at
an end; bumper toasts circulated fast;
song followed song; and glees and catches
without number were trolled, with far
more energy than melody; and cork
after
cork was drawn; and punch-bowl
after punch-bowl was replenished; yet the
interminable thirst of the country squires
seemed all the thirstier for each attempt to
allay it. Before the bounds of decency
had yet been transgressed by any person
present, the butler entered in a pause
between
the quick following bursts of song,
bearing two letters on a large silver waiter
one of which he handed to Capt.
Spencer
,
and the other to Lord Henry St. Maur,
saying aloud, that they had just been
brought by a servant, who had ridden post
from London, and waited an immediate
answer.
Just at this moment, the Earl of
Rochefort
,
excused by his age and character
from prolonging the festivities of the board
to morning light, arose to go; begging,
however, that he might not break up the
party, and apologizing for carrying off his
sonstwo of whom were about to set out
for London in the morning.
There was, of course, a general
movement
of the company, but at Edward
Hale's request they all resumed their seats
he alone following the earl into the hall
to take leave of him; while, on the same
pretence, but in reality wishing to gain an
opportunity of reading their letters,
Spencer
and St. Maur glided out of the room
immediately behind him.
A short time was occupied in hunting up
cloaks, hats, and swords, but it was not long
before the earl's party were all in readiness,
and moving towards the hall door. Just as
they reached it, after taking leave of Sir
Edward
,
Colonel Hardinge, the peer's eldest
son, saw a tall man, in plain riding dress,
with heavy boots and spurs, and a courier's
leather belt about his waist, standing in
the vestibule; and Spencer, who had been
questioning him about the letters he had
brought, gliding away, as if desirous of
escaping
observation.
There was something so singular in the
movement, that the Colonel's attention was
called somewhat particularly to the servant,
and he at once recognised him for a
fellow
who had left him, a few months
before, in order to take service with Lord
Asterly. The man had, as it happened,
been rather a favorite servant, and the
colonel, without much consideration, said
as he passed him,
Ha! Benedict, what has brought you
hither? Are you not living still with my
Lord Asterly?
Yes, colonel, answered the man,
quickly, and quite off his guard; and then
stammering, and appearing a good deal
embarrassedthat is to say, colonel,
he added, I have leftI brought letters!
Hardinge, who had merely spoken for
lack of anything else to do, and without
any great interest in the matter, nodded
only and passed on; but Edward Hale
had caught the words of the servant, and
perceived his obvious confusion; and, as
he returned from escorting the earl to his
carriage, he stopped and asked
Did you bring letters for me, my good
fellow?
No, sir, replied the man at once, I
brought letters for the honorable Captain
Spencer, and my Lord Henry St. Maur!
and I want their answers, if you please,
Sir Edward.
From Lord Asterly? asked Hale, in
astonishment. Are you Lord Asterly's
man?
I was, Sir Edwardbutbut and the
man began again to stutter, and turned
fiery red.
That will do, answered the baronet,
passing onit does not signify at all;
and he thought within himself, that
fellow
has been drinkingor, if not, he is a
knave; and, with his mind a little
disturbed
,
he re-entered the supper room,
where all was revelry and noise, and loud
uproarious glee. Spencer and St. Maur
had not yet returned into the room; but
Percy Harbottle, who had contrived
already
to render himself very popular with
the good-hearted country gentlemen,
called to him as he came in
Come, Ned Hale, comenow that
your steady friends have left us, let us set
to work instantly; we are bound, I must
say to you, in honor, to drink all of these
gentlemen under the table, without any
more delayfor they have had the
audacity
to challenge us to the test, and to talk
of us Christ-church men as if we were
mere milksops. Come, order some mulled
Burgundy, and let us fall on gallantly.
Certainly! certainly! replied Hale
and muttering to himself, for this time,
at least, there is no help for it, I suppose,
he resumed his chair, and the supper
party soon degenerated into a wild and
frantic orgiethrough which Hale and
Harbottle sustained their parts with more
success than either had anticipated; for,
whether it was that their young and
unbroken
constitutions offered better
resistance
to the wine they swallowed than
the enfeebled systems of the inveterate
topers, or that their quietness of manner,
and comparative abstinence during the
early part of the evening, gave them an
advantage, certain it is, that while reveller
after reveller fell from his chair, and was
carried, or staggered out of the room to
be thrust into his carriage, or conveyed to
bed in a state nearly approaching to
insensibility
,
the young men were by no
means even seriously affected by the liquor
they had drunk; and, when they had seen
the last guest safely carried to his
chamber
,
they walked, with feverish brows
indeed, and quivering nerves, and blood
unduly heated, into the drawing-room,
where they found St. Maur and the
Captain
playing, with perfect coolness, at
picquet, and sipping some strong coffee,
which Spencer urged them to take as a
sovereign remedy against the effect of
over-drinking.
Edward Hale poured himself out a cup
of coffee, and then fixing his eyes quietly
on St. Maur's face, asked him in a tranquil
voice.
Was your letter from the Asterlys, St.
Maur?
No! answered St. Maur, steadily,
three tierce majors, captain, and the
quatorze of aces, count fourteen.
Spencer looked up quickly, in utter
astonishment
at the absurd and reekless
falsehood of his friend; but not the
smallest
sign of wonder was visible in his
composed
manners, or on his inscrutable and
impassive features. But he replied at
once, eager if possible to repair the evil
which he foresaw from St. Maur's
injudicious
deniala denial which he knew
must sooner or later be discovered, if it
was not so already.
Nor I, Sir Edward, nor I, eitherfrom
the Asterlysinasmuch as they are
Asterlys
no longerfor that I suppose is what
Henry means; since I saw him get a letter
from the people you mean, at the very
moment I got minewhich certainly is
from her spiteful ladyship; and a very
pretty piece of spite it is too! considering
that one would have expected her to be in
a better humor.
The wonder which the self-possessed
and cold-blooded man of the world had
kept down so perfectly, positively beamed
from every feature of St. Maur's face, as
he heard this avowal, which appeared
quite as incomprehensible to him as did
his falsehood to the other; who, by one of
those marvellous contradictions which we
sometimes discover in the characters of
men, though he would have done almost
any other evil thing in the whole world,
wonld not have told a lie to save his life.
Astonished as he was, however, he saw
the utter inutility of trying to carry the
deception out as he had intended. So
with a loud and boisterous laugh, he cried
out, Oh! fie, you blab! You mar-sport!
You have spoiled all my fun. Why did
you not stick to it, Spencer?
I never say the thing that is not, even
in fun! replied the other gravely; and as
he spoke he met a glance of approbation
beaming from Hale's clear eye, and noted
it; and determined to turn the feeling
which it indicated to his purpose. This of
course passed as quick as lightning; and
at the same moment St. Maur said, for
Spencer's shaft had pierced deeply.
Nor I, nor I, Captain Spencer, but
your words do not apply; for I said the
thing that isthe true thing!I did
not
get a letter from the Asterlys.
True, true! replied the Captain with
a smile, my remark was uncivil and
inappropriate
.
Excuse it.
But gentlemen, gentlemen, interposed
Hale, laughing and yet puzzled, why am
I to be left in the basket? how is this, you
speak truth to the ear and riddles to the
sense? The Earl of Asterly
Is Earl of Asterly no longer,
answered
Spencer. It has pleased his most
gracious majesty James by the Grace of
God, for reasons which I suppose he and
his ministers knowfor I am sure nobody
else doesto create his dull earlship
Marquis
of Beverley; so now I suppose he will
be duller, and more pompous, and more
utterly intolerable than ever.
Indeed, Marquis of Beverley? and
news, captain?
Is from the new made marchioness. I
cannot show it to you, Sir Edward.
Ladies'
letters you knowbut I wish I could,
for it is capitalcapital!
Strange, strange! thought Edward
Hale within himself, although he gave his
thoughts no utterance; strange that I
should have heard nothing of the matter.
But aloud he only saidDoes her
ladyship
mention anything of Lord
Arthur's
whereabouts? I hope and in fact
expected that he would have been here
to-day? Does she mention him at all?
Not a word, not a word about him,
replied Spencer. Her ladyship is not, I
fancy, the most anxious or affectionate of
mothers! By heaven! I repique you, St.
Maur, Yes, I repique youthree of my
points! twelve for my four tierce majors?
fourteen for my four aces! fourteen for
my four kings! fourteen for my four
queens! sixty for the repique! thirteen I
gain on the cards in playing, and forty for
the capot! a hundred and seventy in all.
I never saw that stroke happen before. I
doubt if it ever did! but it is just, I will
bet ten to one. Will you bet, Harbottle?
No? Well, good night!it is late; good
night.
CHAPTER VII.
That
same night there had been a gay
and sumptuous ball in London, at the
prime minister's. The king had himself
honored it with his presence for an hour
or two; and all that was gay and witty,
great and beautiful, wise, noble, or in any
way distinguished, had been assembled
round the monarch's person. Nothing
could possibly have been more brilliant in
the shape of a fte, nothing at the same
time more magnificent and merry.
But the ball had come to an end, as all
earthly pleasures will, even the purest and
the most enduring; and once ended had
left the heart full of bitterness and ashes,
or at the best vacant and exhausted. The
guests had departed to their homes, to
abuse one another, and criticise, as it might
be, the ostentation or the meanness of
their entertainers. The crash of carriages
and the din and quarrelling of drunken
servants had subsided into stillness; the
lights were extinguished in the ball-room;
the flowers were fading on the wall; the
tables were strewn with the relics of the
splendid supper; and who was now the
happier, for the wild gaiety, the lavish
luxury, the vast expanse!
In a large airy bed chamber situated in
the corner of a stately house in Spring
Gardens, the newly created marquis's, the
Lady Fanny Asterly was sitting by an open
window that overlooked the beautiful and
quiet Thames, pensive and melancholy,
and undressed, as if for bed; yet she sat
there as she had sat for about an hour,
and taken no thought of the time, nor
dreamed of lying down since she
dismissed
her woman.
That evening she had been the beauty
of the ball-room, the admired of all men,
the observed of all the observers.
Adulations
had flowed into her ears in one
continuous
stream of silvery music; homage
the most devoted, attentions such as must
gratify every female heart, even when
those who tender them are but regarded
lightly, had been paid her on all sides.
Even the monarch had remarked her
charms with an observant eye, and struck
with her graceful manners and rare
beauty
,
had desired that she should be
presented
to him. Beauty could have no greater
triumph than Fanny Asterly's had met at
that high festival. Nor, while the triumph
lasted, had she been insensible to
something
akin to gratified ambition, to the high
perilous excitement of successful vanity,
and conscious superiority.
Her cheek had flushed with a warmer
and more bright carnation; her eye had
beamed more exultingly than its wont, as
she swam through the mazes of the
voluptuous dance, the cynosure of every
eye; and heard the stifled hum of
admiration
which followed her steps
everywhere
that
hushed and sincere applanse,
paid by the heart to loveliness, which every
woman understands, and to which she
who is insensible, can scarcely be called
woman. Greater or less it may be, but
not genuine, very womannot that sweet
fascinating compound, whose very
weakness
is so far more adorable than any
strength of mind or purpose; whose very
virtues are so much made up from, and
complicated with; those weaknesses, that
you can scarcely destroy one without
throwing down the other; whose very
love of pleasing and thirst for
admiration
are perhaps half the secret of the
pleasure which she inspiresthe
admiration
which she wins from half reluctant
reason.
And Fanny Asterly was not insensible,
nor yet ungratifiedfor she was indeed all
womansweet, gentle, innocent, and
amiable
;
yet in her every phase of thought, in
her every fault, her every charm, a very,
very woman. Yes! she had been pleased,
delighted, almost intoxicated by the events
of that evening; yet now, though she had
not one thought or deed for which she
could reproach herself with justice, it
was with no sense of pleasure that she
recurred
to the events of the ball.
She felt annoyed and angry with herself
that she shoutd have been pleased and
amused by such frivolous folly; she
fancied
that she had been guilty of a sort of
half infidelity to Edward Hale, in suffering
herself to listen to the flatteries, and to be
pleased with the attentions of the young
cavaliers of the court of James.
And this is his birth-day, toothis is
the very day on which, one little year ago,
he plighted me his faith, and we
exchanged
rings in the linden avenue at
Asterly. Dear little ring and she raised
her finger to her lips, and kissed the
senseless
gift of her lover's affectiondear
little
ring, how I love youhow I wish that
he were with me here who gave you to
me a year since; and he, I doubt it not,
he hath been thinking of me all this night;
while I, false girl, have been listening
and smiling, as if I had forgottenbut no!
no! Edward, Edward she went on,
becoming
more excited as she gave vent to
her feelingsit is not soit is not. I
am truetrue to you in my heart of
hearts, Edward! There is not, in my
most secret soul, dear Edward, one
thought which I would hide from thee
one thought which I would hesitate to
tellone thought on which thou wouldst
not smile thine approbation, even as, I
doubt not, in
thy
spirit there is not one
passing fancy which should raise a blush
or call up a frown on my cheek or brow,
did I know it.
Alas! for the pure confidence of
innocentand
guileless womanhood. Unsullied
herself as the virgin snow, her heart and
mind an unsoiled sheet, as it were, of
parchment, until love had inscribed there
one foundly cherished name, she never
doubted that he on whom she had set the
priceless jewel of her inestimable love
was spotless as herself from any taint of
voluptuous and sensual sinnothing that
she could have heard, scarce anything
that she could have seen, were it not in
his own handwriting, or from his own
tongue, would have induced her to
believe
that at this very moment he was
coveting if not loving the charms of
another
woman.
Alas! alas! how does the boasted
virtue
of the most virtuous and moral of
us men shrink into measureless vice,
when compared with the purity, the trust,
the truth of an innocent and loving
woman
.
Edward Hale was no worse, nay, he
was far less evil than the generality of
young men of his age, at that, or perhaps
at any day. Yet, troth-plighted as he
was to that sweet girl, he dreamed not
that he did
her
any wrong in dallying with
other women, in winning their affections,
in defrauding them of their virtues, so
long as he preserved his own
heart
and
his own affections in allegiance to her
empire
;
and by a sophistry not uncommon,
though most absurd and inconsistent, he
justified himself in this breach both of
purity
and truth by saying to himself that
by her father's decision a year was yet to
pass before she could yet be his wife.
And she, while his heart was afire with
unholy passions for the betrothed wife of
another, and his brain busy with intrigues
whereby to work her ruin, she, in her
exquisite
purity of soul, was accusing
herself
of faithlessness, and almost weeping
over her own imaginary delinquencies,
because
she had danced a few harmless
dances, and listened to a few unmeaning
compliments, and perhaps, at the most,
endured a casual pressure of the hand
from some gay coxcomb, whose
attentions
had no meaning beyond the present.
But she was sad at heartthe
excitement
of the last hours had ceased, and
the cold re-action had ensued, as is so
frequently
the case, more painfully than the
bygone sensations had been pleasurable.
She was sad, almost sick at heart.
The moon was shining broadly into the
tall French windows of her chamber, for
she was near her full, and the skies were
almost as light as at noonday, except when
some great cloud came sweeping over the
bright disc, and veiling everything for a
few moments in clear and almost luminous
obscurity, when compared to the darkness
of a moonless midnight. And still she sat
there watching the vast shadows creeping
over the river's breast, and over the silent
streets, and drawing fancied auguries from
their strange forms and ghost-like
movements
.
After awhile she pressed her hand on
her heart and said, in low, mournful
tones, I know not what it isI know
not what ails me! I do wish that I had
seen Serena this morning, or that I could
see Arthur nowI have no reason, it is
true, for any fear or apprehensionyet I
do fear everything! Oh! how unhappy
I amoh! how unhappy? There seemed
to fall a shadow on my heart, a chill
upon
my spirit, as I saw that Sir Henry
Davenant
pass by the window, with his
bitter
and sarcastic smileand he has seemed
to haunt me ever since! I met him twice
when I was walking out this morning in
the park, and both times he sneered at
me with his horrid supercilious courtliness
and then, this evening at the ball, his
cold snake-like eye was never withdrawn
from my face for a moment; whenever I
stopped in the dance, or turned my head
from hearing some gay speech, I was
sure to catch sight of him. He put me in
mind of the skeleton the old Egyptians
used to place at their banquets as a
ghastly
admonition. Whenever I beheld him,
my heart stood still within me; and my
blood seemed to run cold. Why can it be
that I so loathe that man? Can it be, that
the soul is prescient of its secret foes, and
is inexplicably warned against those that
shall work it woe?No! no!It cannot
beand yetI do believeI dothat he
will one day injure me. And she paused
for a long time, and sat still, thinking
deeply; but almost unconscious that she
was thinking at all, so wildly and
fantastically
did her thoughts come and go; at
last she gave a sort of start; and
exclaimed
,Yes!
there is something going
onthere is something wrong and evil
plotting against us, I am sure. My
motherI observed my mother's eye
many times to-day, fixed on me and not
lovingly.She does
not
love me!and
yet, my God, my God, what have I ever
done, or failed to do, that she should not?
She never loved me; never liked Edward!
alas! alas! and my father, though kind,
is not energetical.Oh! Arthur, Arthur,
my dear brother, why are you not here,
why are you not at hand to help and
comfort
your unhappy sister?She wrote
to-day
to St. Maur, and to Spencer, at
his
house at Arrington, and not one word to
him! To Spencerfor what can she
write to him; but for evilevil, it must
be evil! And oh! why will he associate
himself with comrades such as Lord
Henry
,
and this Captain Spencer, of whom no
man or woman had ever yet one good
word to saywhose very glance is
poison
!Oh!
EdwardEdwarddid you
but knowcould you but know what
agony it gives me.But no! he knows it
nothe cannot know it!Nor can I send
him word at all, nor even summon him to
6
town, unless my brother should come
back! For a few minutes she was again
silent, but then rising from her chair
suddenly
,
she fell down upon her knees, and
prayed fervently and long; and her meek
supplication finished, stood up refreshed
and strengthened, and feeling something
like a ray of heavenly consolation shining
upon her heart.
Well, it is very late, she said; I
will to-bed, to-bed! but, I fear, not to
sleep! and drawing the curtain over the
window, through which the moonlight
fell too brilliantly and full upon her couch,
she walked across the room to reach
something from a table, covered with
books and drawings, and a few stands of
flowers, before she lay down to rest.
She had taken up the article, whatever
it was, of which she was in search, and
was in the act of turning away from the
table, when her eye fell quite suddenly,
and as if by accident, upon a neatly folded
note, which she did not remember to have
seen when she came into the room, on
her return from the minister's ball. She
took it up; it was unopened, and secured
with a seal of red wax, bearing a deep
impression
,
an antique head of Minerva.
Thinking to herself that something must
have been lying over it when she looked
upon the table as she re-entered her room,
she walked with the note to the window,
in order to read it by the aid of the clear
moonlight.
Though she was very anxious, she
knew not why, to arrive at the contents;
and though she half prognosticated
something
of evil tidings, she yet, as we often
do, even when we are the most impatient,
turned it again and again, to examine the
seal and superscription, and conjecture
from whom it possibly could have come,
when in all probability by opening it she
would have learned the whole in a
moment
.
Her hand literally shook as she broke
the seal, and her eyes swam, as if dazzled
by excess of light, so that some moments
passed before she could fix the letters.
At last, by a great effort, she composed
herself, and read as follows:
One, who has seen and known the
Lady Frances Asterly, almost from her
cradle to the present day, although she
knows him not, nor has ever seen him
who has watched her growth, daily, nay
almost hourly, from the wild buoyant
days of thoughtless infancy, through the
sweet spring of girlhood, up to her present
plenitude of glorious beautywho has
marked every growing charm both of
mind and bodywho has noted her fea
tures, full of rare inborn music, her form
ripe in most perfect lovelinesswho has
read her soul, and knows it to be pure
and bright and spotless as the spirit of the
new-born babe, fresh from the hands of
the Creatorwho loves her with an
affection
surpassing that of a father,
because
,
unlike a father's, it is divested of all
prejudice, and arises only from his sense
of her exquisite and peerless beauty,
beauty both of mind and body. One who,
had he the means of altering his mission
and changing his existence, would be her
guardian spiritone who has many times
already stood, though she knew it not,
between her and many an earthly peril
writes now once more to warn, and if
possible to save her. Mark his words,
innocent
and lovely one, mark his words;
and, although the task be a hard and
bitter
one, believe them and be warned.
And oh! above all, fancy not that he who
writes these lines, has any secret or
unworthy
objectthat he is a resentful
rival
,
a discarded suitor, an avenger of
wrong done
For I am none of these. Before thou
wert born I was old, wronged, and
wretched. It was a fate, a wondrous
fate, that interested me in thy birth, and
it has been my fate ever to cross thy path,
till I am, as it were, wound up in thy well
being. I had a daughter once, innocent
as thou art, and almost as beautifulshe
heard, but would not heed my warning
she wedded, was deceived, lived
wretched
,
and died young, young and
heart-broken
,
as though wilt live, and die also,
Fanny, if thou attend not this my
warning
.
He unto whom thy troth is plighted is
not what thou deemest him, not what
could make thee happy. Even now his
house is full of revelry and riot,
debauchery
andwhat it befits thee not to hear
of. His friends and chosen comrades, the
worst, the most notorious of the world's
wicked devotees. Beware! beware! ere
it shall be too late!
Be warned by my words, Fanny; but,
even warned, I ask you not to act upon
them, until convinced that they are true
true to the letter, or if lacking truth,
lacking it only in that they come not up
to the full measure of his wildness, his
unworthiness, his falsehood.
Reject this warning, and you are lost
for ever!
Eagerly she devoured every word of
this strange wild epistle. She read it and
re-read it, and in her own despite she felt
that it had left a sting in her soul. It was
in vain she said to herself, Tush! it is
but an ordinary slander! a vile thing
composed
by a wretch who dares not sign
his name to the emanations of his own
guilty mind. It was in vain; she could
not so banish it for there was something in
the whole style and wording of the letter,
in the antique and flowery phraseology,
in the obscurity and mystery in which the
writer was shrouded, in the dark sounding
prophecies, and the strange emphasis of
the warning, that made it obviously
different
from a commonplace anonymous
letter
.
The character of Lady Fanny was
naturally
somewhat poetical and romantically
inclined; and on this, doubtless, the
writer
had calculated in framing his artful and
insidious missive. It happened,
moreover
,
that the very tone of thoughts in
which she was indulging herself at the
time, harmonized singularly with the
spirit of the letter, and of the warning it
contained. She had been secretly
deploring
the connexion of her betrothed
husband
with the men whom she knew to be
his companions at this moment; and lo!
the letter spoke, not in dark hints, but in
open language and spoke, as she
believed
truly, their characters in the world's
estimation; and when the world does
indeed
condemn unanimously, it is rare that
it condemns unjustly.
Besides, did it not challenge
investigation
?
Did it not recommend inquiry? It
could not, therefore, be a mere baseless
slander. Oh! of a truth it was very
plausible! A very cunning spirit had
devised
that shaft, had steeped it in the very
poisons which with a devilish foresight it
knew would be the most likely to corrode
and canker that pure heart; and a strong
hand, and practised in the works of evil,
when the unguarded moment had been
duly chosen, sped it with sure aim to the
mark, to rankle there, and blight the very
soul of confidence.
CHAPTER VIII.
It
was not until a late hour, late at least
for those primitive days, that Edward Hale
awoke on the morning following the
revels of the first of May; and when he
did awake it was with a fevered frame
and an aching head. Some one or other,
I forget who, has said that a man ought to
get drunk every now and then for the sake
of the serious thoughts, the earnest
promises
of reformation, and the very thorough
process of remorse and repentance which
he goes through on the morning
succeeding
to a hard debauch. Without entering
into the morality of this question at all, or
inquiring whether, even if the salutary
effects
be not overstated, a man
ought
to do
ill that good may come of it, it cannot be
disputed that the frame of mind in which
a man is left on the subsidence of that
violent excitement, conjoined with the
discomfort of the body, is such as to lead
him naturally to grave and serious
reflection
.
And so it was, in this instance, with the
young baronet. He was not by nature at
all disinclined to calm, and, at times,
almost
solemn meditation; although the
character of his reveries was for the most
part rather imaginative and romantic than
contemplative or moral. Although gay
and joyous, and endowed largely with
those high spirits which flow from youth
and health, unchecked by present ills, or
presages of future sorrow, he was rather
of a poetical temperament, and that leads
oftentimes to a reflective mood.
This morning in particular, after he had
arisen from his bed and dressed himself
partially, he sent away his valet, and
began
to ponder seriously on the
occurrences
of the past day.
As he sat in his armed chair, partially
leaning on the sill of the open window,
looking over the green meadow whereon
still stood the tall May-pole, although the
giddy crowd who had made all the space
around it so gay on the preceding morning
were now dispersed about their ordinary
avocations, his thoughts reverted instantly
to the beautiful queen of the May. At
this calm season of the day, ere the sun
had yet heated the earth, while the air
came in fresh and dewy from the cool
woods and grassy meadows, and fanned
his brow with its fresh breath, the
feverish
excitements and hot passions of the
past day seemed out of place,
unhallowed
,
and distasteful. Better things were at
work within him; better thoughts were
aroused by the comparison involuntarily
drawn between that innocent and tranquil
daybreak, and the wild revel of the past
night.
He was a different man this morning,
and the pictures which his mind conjured
up before him of beautiful Rose Castleton,
were not such as he had seen through the
medium of glowing Burgundy. He thought
not of her now, with her voluptuous figure
swaying and bending in the dance, its
every wavy line instinct with hidden
passion
;
of her white bosom, all too much
exposed by the disordered kerchie grow
ing and throbbing in soft tumult; of her
eyes now beaming bright with gratified
ambition, now swelling, swimming,
languishing
in amorous dimness; of her
sweet pouting lips; her balmy breath
fluttering
and panting between surprise and
half offended modesty; of her honeyed
kiss; of her rare form struggling in his
embrace, and yet half willing to be
detained
,
as he snatched the kiss from her lips,
and the rose bud from her bosom; of the
low, silvery, faltering voice in which she
promised to meet him the next evening in
the Monk's coppice! No! these were not
the pictures which his fancy this morning
set before him. Far, far from it. He
saw her weeping, disconsolate, and
pensive
at her spinning wheel, in some such
touching attitude as that wherein the great
German painter has given a form and body
to the rare spiritual Margaret of the great
German poet.

Retsch's Outline Illustrations of Goethe's
Faust.
He saw her with every
vestige of color vanished from her wan
cheek, every spark quenched in her bright
eye; all the soft roundness of her lovely
form wasted away and lost. He saw her
kneeling at the village shrine with
clasped
hands and streaming eyes, while the
stern fiend remorse was whispering in her
ear to despair and die. He saw her
prostrate
at her grey-headed father's feet,
clasping his knees and supplicating him
to pardon his lost childhe saw the
clenched hand, and the knitted brow, and
the indignant eye of the relentless father,
driving forth the dishonored girl, who had
brought shame on his grey hairshe saw
the rude rout of the village, the coarse
brutal rabble hooting
the harlot
through the
long sunny street, and hallooing for the
beadle and the ducking stool! He saw
her by the still pool in the dark woodland,
where the stream has no ripple on its
surface, and the black waters tell of its
unusual depth, kneeling and striving
vainly to syllable a prayer for mercy
before
that awful plunge which should
remove
her, and for ever, from the cold
sneers of the ruthless world! He saw her
drawn out by the shuddering hands of
superstitious rustics, cold, wan,
dishevelled
,
deaddead, by her own rash act
her own! say rather
his! his
whose false
love had driven her to the brink of that
abyss whose bottom is perdition!
All this he saw, or seemed to see, in
the delineations of his vivid fancy; he
saw, and shuddered at the strength of his
own imaginings. And shall I, he
said to himself, half aloud, shall I, for
the poor gratification of a foul sensual
passion, shall I do this thing? For a few
hours, or a few days of fierce and fiery
pleasure, shall I pollute so fair a temple, a
temple reared by the hands of our
common
God and Father, to be the dwelling
of as fair a spirit? shall I, for any temporal
delight, perhaps consign her to eternal
ruin? God forbid! God forbid! and he
stood up in the intensity of his feelings, for
he had worked himself up to a state of
considerable
excitement, and walked for
several
minutes to and fro the room,
strengthening
his good resolves at every turn, and
manning the fortress of his heart against
the assaults of the Evil One, till he at last
satisfied himself that he was again master
of himself, that he could see and converse
with the country beauty, without incurring
any danger, or feeling any undue
admiration
of her charms; and finally he
determined
that with a magnanimity like that
of Scipio, he would at once bring about
her marriage with young Hunter, and give
her the lease of the home farm for a dowry.
This honorable resolution taken, well
pleased with himself, conscious of
honorable
feelings, and proud of his own
integrity
,
superior to its first very grave
temptation
,
he sat down once again to reflect
on the perfections of his legitimate lady
love, and anticipate in imagination his
future
marriage with the charming Lady
Fanny.
For one whose whole life had been
but one scene of success and pleasure, who
had scarce known, as yet, the meaning of
the word sorrow, so little had any touch of
it come near to him, Edward Hale did truly
and sincerely love Frances Asterly. It was
not her beauty only, nor her sweet
manners
that had won him; but her heart, her
mindthe purity and truthfulness of the
one, the kind, affectionate, and cordial
nature
of the other! And when a man sets
his love on the qualities of the intellect and
of the heartthe qualities that are
immortal
and endure for ever in never fading and
undying gloryand not upon the qualities
of the poor body, that speedily are but as
grass cut down and cast into the oven
small risk is there of his loving unworthily,
or of his changing easily! For, in a word,
so to love is a proof of character, higher
than ordinary men possess, in the lover,
and a guarantee for the existence of
unusual
qualifications in the object beloved.
And, in both points, this was true of the
present case; for Sir Edward Hale was,
beyond doubt, a person of qualifications
and mental character far above the
standard
average of men. It might be doubtful,
hitherto, whether that character would
turn our powerful for good or for evil in the
endwhether those qualifications would
serve to adorn and decorate a virtuous and
honorable life, or to lend a false and
meteorie
splendor to an irregular and disorderly
career; but there could be no doubt that,
whichever way the wheel of his destinies
should turn, in that course he would be
found conspicuous and above his fellows,
either in virtue or in vice.
Thus far at least, the better spirit
had prevailed; and, as he finished
dressing
himself, which he did unassisted
by his valet, his heart was more at ease,
and he was in truth both a happier and a
better man than he had been on the
previous
morning; and it was with a gay and
joyous exterior, covering a self-satisfied
and tranquil confidence in his own good
intentions, that he descended the grand
staircase to join his companions in the
breakfast parlor.
Some short time, however, before he was
ready to go down, he was not a little
surprised
to hear the sound of voices on the
terrace below his windows; the rather as
he knew of old that St. Maur was
habitually
a late riserrarely displaying the
glories
of his well decorated person to
profane
and vulgar eyes until high noonand
he had no reason for suspecting that the
gay captain was more matutinal than his
friend. He looked out of the window,
therefore, wondering who these could be
that were astir already; and yet more to
his surprise, he found that the very men
whom he would almost have sworn had
not yet turned themselves over to take
their second nap, were walking to and fro
upon the terrace, pausing every now and
then, and talking earnestly in a low voice,
as if they were unwilling that their words
should be overheard.
This Hale did not observe at the time,
but afterwards events occurred which often
led him to reflect on various things which
passed that morning; and then he
recollected
this, and recollected, moreover, that
when they first saw him leaning out of the
window looking at them, there was a sort
of consciousness if not embarrassment;
about St. Maur's air and manner,
indicating
that he was, in some sort, the subject
of their discourse.
He did notice, however, and not without
surprise, that they were both fully dressed,
their periwigs arranged and powdered
with careful nicety, and the whole of their
attire showing, by its scrupulous precision,
that they must have been on foot some
hours, and that their toilets had been
performed
not negligently nor in haste.
Hale waited for a moment without speak
ing, until they came directly under his
windows, when he dropped a rose-bud
which chanced to be lying on the table
the same which he had snatched from the
bosom of Rose Castleton in the evening
so that it fell immediately in front of St.
Maur.
He stooped to pick it up from the broad
flag-stones that paved the terrace, and then
cried, as he raised his eyes to the window,
before seeing who it was
By George! a fair challenge, be you
who you may, sweet. Ah! you rogue,
you rogue, Ned! so it is you, is it? I
thought it had been some fair dame or
damsel of whom my
beaux yeux
had made
a conquest. This is a pretty
disappointment
!
Your ugly phiz, in lieu of black
eyes and cherry cheeks, and I know not
what beside! The devil take you, Ned!
the devil take you!
Many thanks to you, replied Hale,
laughing, for the warmth of your
morning
salutation, which I will not return. I
have to crave your pardon, Captain
Spencer
,
for playing such a sluggard part, as
host, who ought to have been on foot to
receive my guest. But it seems the
mulled
Burgundy made me a more sleepy
night-cap than it did for you!
You forget, you forget, answered
Spencer, that St. Maur and I did not
double the said night-cap quite so often as
you did, and it sat in consequence less
heavily on us; but pray don't think of
apologizing; we have been amusing
ourselves
delightfully here this fine clear
morning, looking about your magnificent
old place.
Thank you for saying so, returned
Hale, but I fear you could have found
little to amuse you; but I will dress
myself
in haste, and come down to youwill
you be so kind in the meantime as to call
for chocolate, and make yourselves quite
at home? After breakfast we will see
what we can do to kill the day. It is not
a good time of the year for country sports,
unless any of you are fishermen; there are
fine trout in the river. But I fancy Mark
can find us a heron or two, and I have a
few cast of fine hawks, if you like to see
a flight; coursing and hunting are of
course out of the question; but I can give
you some capital rabbit shooting in the
fern of the upper deer-park.
Oh! I have no doubt we shall do very
well; but make haste, make haste, what
we desire most is your company, said
the captain, but almost in the same breath,
he added in a half whisper to St. Maur,
and as our desire will be gratified in a
few moments, we must talk out our talk
at once. What were you sayingoh, yes!
about Harbottleno, no! that will never
dohe is not at all to be trusted in
delicate
matters like these. No, no! leave it
to me, and my life on it, I arrange
everything
to your wishes. But after all I
cannot
guess, for my soul, why you are so
wild to marry this penniless girl. It is
true, I confess, that she is devilish
handsome
,
and sprightly looking also; if she
were some fellow's wife now, I could
understand
it; but to marry herto marry
her! Pshaw, pshaw! it is mere boy's
play. If I were you I would let Hale
marry her, nay, help him to her, and then
take her from him; by the Lord, there is a
great game to be played there.
Hold, Spencer, hold! St. Maur
interrupted
him, you forget that you are
talking
of a girl whom I seriously intend to
make my wife.
Indeed I do not, my good fellow; I
only wish to give you all the good advice
I can beforehand; after she is your wife I
shall remember it, you may be sure
unless
indeed I should take a fancy to her
myselfthere is no saying what may
happen
,
when men marry handsome wives;
a friend's wife now is twice as good as an
acquaintance's, and an acquaintance's as
a stranger's!
By heavens! Spencer, you are
incorrigible
;
I should be hurt and angry with
you, if I did not know that it is only your
wild way of talking, and that you would
not
do
the things you talk about to win the
world!
Oh no, said Spencer, with a dubious
smile, not at all, not at all! only, as there
is no saying what may happen, and as I
hate treachery as I do the devil or the
parson; only don't say, if anything should
turn up, that I did not give you fair
warning
,
Harry.
St. Maur looked at him for a minute or
two steadily, as if to see whether he was
in earnest, and then said, bursting into a
light laugh
You are a sad fellow, but I am not
afraid of you. Well, go on, what is the
whole of your scheme? let us be perfect
in it.
Why it seems that this old she devil
has arranged all the preliminaries with
pretty Fan already. She is to be made to
believe Hale a perfect devil of
licentiousness
,
and so break off the match with
him; when you will have it all your own
way; for there was never a man yet, who,
backed by father and mother, could not
win any girl's love at any time, when her
fancy is disengaged, unless he is a greater
fool than I take you to be. Then she will
be piqued and her vanity wounded in this
case, which will make it easier yet for
you; and if, as you say, she does dislike
you now, that does not hurt your chance
a straw's value; for my own part, when
I want to win a woman, next to her
loving
me beforehand, I would choose to
have her
hate me!
Nothing is so difficult
to deal with as indifferencefor they
always
go by contraries and extremes
women
do, I mean, Harry; and so if they
begin
by hating you, and thinking you a
fiend of darkness, they are pretty sure to
adore you in six weeks, and discover that
you are an angel of light.
Yes, yes! that is all very fineone of
your wiredrawn theories that come to
nothing
!
However, I do not doubt but I can
win her easily enough if we can set her
against Hale.
Well, that is easily done enough, I am
sure. Why here is luck playing into your
very hand. The old woman has laid the
foundation of distrust in her daughter's
heart already; and here is this young baby
half wild now after this country girlwho
by the way is pretty enough to make a
wiser man wild. My only fear was that
she would be too willing. But I have
taken care of thatshe will not meet him
to-night, and that will whet his appetite;
then you must play your own partextol
her beauty, feed his passion as much as
you can; and I will sneer at himwe will
bet high on his success, you for and I
against it! I saw at a glimpse that
game-keeper
was a rogue, and I have bought
him; he will help us through anything.
Then I have sent for my lieutenant and a
press gang to be here to-morrow, and we
will screw him up to-night to sign an
order
to have Hunter pressed. It is a devil
of a stretch I know; but we who serve
King Jamie to the utmost, know how to
stretch a commission without cracking it;
and we will have him carry off the girl,
and so arrange things that it shall all come
our directly; and so he will be disgraced
in the eyes of all good people, and dished
with lady Fan.
Yes, that will do, if we can
accomplish
it.
If, if!to the devil with your ifs!I
tell you it
is
half accomplished now. I
should not at all wonder, if he have half
repented of his wicked wishes this fine
morning, now that he is maudlinyour
maudlin state is a great virtue breeder!
But I have laid a trap for him that will set
his tinder in a blaze presently. Do you
but play your part well, and talk all day
of her charms, and try to make him
jealous
of that fool Harbottle, who is I think
smitten a little with the wench already
get him to show that if you canand
now, do not forget to write to Delaval, as
I told you, expressing your surprise at
finding Hale, as he had hinted to you,
such a wild rake and jolly fellow. Invent,
invent! describe his harems and his
orgies
!
Draw, draw upon imagination, or
if that fail you, look to the Arabian Nights!
But hark you, all in your proper character,
reckless and rashno sermonizing, or
you will spoil all. Do you understand?
Yes, to be sure; it will be shown
To her cousin, Lady Serena Fortescue,
who will tell her so, that she shall never
doubt the channel. I, too, will write to
Davenant, in a quite different strain, but
to the same effect. I only wish I could
have got him to commit some outrage or
indecency before that puritanical old beast
and idiot, Rochefort; that would have set
him
talking.
At this moment Sir Edward appeared
coming down the steps from the front door
to join them; and at the same time Eversley
passed them going to meet his master,
with a beantiful black greyhound bitch
following at his heel, and a large bunch of
violets in his hand.
Ha! Master Keeper, exclaimed
Spencer
,
as the man went by; what's in the
wind now? and he spoke loud, on
purpose
that Hale might hear him; and then,
as Eversley turned round to answer him,
he went onBy George! what a posy
thou hast got there! Here, give it to me,
man, give it to me, and take this guinea
in exchange, for I am mortal fond of
posies.
Excuse me, Captain Spencer, said
the fellow, grinning and pocketing the
guinea which the sailor flung to him;
excuse me, for I would give it willingly
if it was mine, which it is not; it is a
present
I am carrying to master.
What's all this? what's all this? said
the young Lord of the Manor, laughing.
Why don't you give Capt. Spencer the
flowers, Mark?
Nay, nay, Sir Edward, she that gave
them to me desired me to put them in your
own hand, and by the same token she
sent a message, too.
She! she!
exclaimed St. Maur;
Spencer
,
I'll bet you a rouleau I can put a name
to the
she!
Done! done! replied the captain;
done, that you cannot put the
right
one.
Whisper it now to me, and we will leave
it to his honor afterwards.
Well, then, I say Rose Castleton,
replied
St. Maur, in what was meant to pass
for a whisper, although it reached Ed
ward's ears as plainly as if it had been
uttered in a shout.
I bide my bet, said Spencer in the
same sort of whisper; I shall win it too;
that girl is not to be won so easily
he
will
never win her! But come, he added,
now speaking in his natural tones, come;
Mercury, it seems, will not deliver his
message in the presence of the assembled
gods, but keeps it for the private ear of
Jove. Let us leave themand they
moved
off a little way, out of ear-shot, although
they watched every movement of the
parties
.
They saw the hot blood mount crimson
to the fair brow of the young man as he
received the nosegay and the message;
but it was evident that his face reddened
not with anger, for his eye sparkled and
there was a smile upon his lip as he asked
several questions, to all of which he got
prompt answers from the keeper, who had
been primed already for his part by the
wily plotters, and now played it to
perfection
.
The conference did not last above five
minutes when Hale turned away, saying
Be in the way, after breakfast; for we
will either shoot, or see those new merlins
fly. Canst find us a heron-shaw this fine
morning?
I'll warrant you, Sir Edward?
Well, we will see anon. Now let us
go to breakfast, gentleman. I think a
broiled turkey's gizzard will suit my
stomach
to a turn this morning, for, to speak
truth, I do feel a little squeamish after the
Burgundy. But where is Harbottle? Has
nobody seen Harbottle? Run, Mark, and
send some one to call Mr. Harbottle to
breakfast.
But in the meantime, baronet, said
Spencer, touching this bouquet, of which
I see you think so well you are wearing it
next to you heart; will you decide our bet,
upon your honor?
Is it correct to do so, Captain, when it
concerns a woman?
No, if it be a ladyyes! if a country
girl, Sir Edward.
I believe you are in the right; the
rather
that she seems to me rather a light o'
love. How stands your bet?
St. Maur bets that it was Rose
Castleton
that sent you the violets. I hold the
opposite.
St. Maur has won, captain, it was
she!
There, Spencer, there, cried the
young lord triumphantly, unbuckle,
sailor
man, unbuckle your fat legs; out with
the rouleau.
Spencer pulled out his purse, and with
apparent reluctance handed to him the
sum which he had lost, saying, as he did
so,
I must look out for Percy Harbottle,
now for you dare not stand the other bet,
St. Maur.
What other bet? what other bet,
Captain
Spencer? answered Lord Henry with
well feigned eagerness, and a little show
of anger. I do not like such remarks
as these! I stand any bet that any man
dare stand, at least if I see a possibility of
winning it. What bet is it you mean?
That he wins her, answered Spencer,
that he wins the girl in any reasonable
time; you dare not bet that, St. Maur; but
it does not come within your category
there is
no
possibility of your winning it.
I will, though, I
will!
exclaimed St.
Maur; I will bet a cool thousand that he
has her living with him as his mistress in
a fortnight.
A cool thousand! done! I shall win
that, said the captain confidently.
They had been all walking together
towards
the house, while this conversation,
if conversation it can be called, was going
forward; but now Sir Edward stopped
short, piqued not a little at the sort of
undervaluing
way in which Spencer spoke
of his chances with the girl, and trying to
laugh, but evidently a little mortified
And why do you think so, Captain
Spencer? Have you so vast an idea of
the girl's virtue?
Why, I had rather you would pardon
me. I was in the wrong to speak as I did;
I would rather you would ask me no
more.
No, no; speak out. You have said
too much, or too little. I insist on it, that
you let us have the whole. Do you think
her impregnable!
Oh dear, no! Far from it, She is
willing enough, any one can see. But you
will excuse me, Sir Edward, I have some
experience in these matters, and I do not
think you are the man.
Who then? yourself, perhaps,
captain
?
replied Hale, still more piqued by
his answer, although perfectly good
humored
.
Oh, no! not myself, upon my word!
though I should like very well to have the
wench in London for a month or so, for she
is a devilish handsome woman, that is
certain
;
and her slim round figure would show
admirably well in a mazarine blue
riding-dress
of the last mode, slashed with gold
colored brocade. By heaven! I think I
can see her now, reming that strawberry
roan Spanish jenet of mine through the
Parks. Heavens! St. Maur, how she would
catch men's eyes. It would be a year's
renown
to return to London as her protector.
But I beg your pardon, Sir Edward, for
wandering
from your question; no! I assure you
on my honor, that I had not myself in mind
at all, when I spoke. No! I think Percy
Harbottle a likelier man. I saw her look
at him out of the corners of those large
languishing eyes of hers, two or three
times while you were dancing with her.
Perhaps you would like, captain,
replied
Hale, assuming a tranquillity which
he did not feel, perhaps you will like to
bet that she will be Harbottle's mistress in
a week, and
not
mine, for I intend to try all
means to make her mine.
Of course you do, said St. Maur;
nobody doubted thatnobody, at least,
who knows you. With the
encouragement
you have had, you would be a
precions
ninny if you did not. Of course you
will try, and succeed, too. I'll be sworn
of it.
I cannot bet that she
will
be
Harbottle's
mistress, for I don't know at all that
he is thinking about her. I
would
betbut
no, no! baronet, he interrupted himself,
I am your guest, and I don't wish to
win your money. Besides, it is my jesting
that has put you up to the notion. It
would not be fair.
To the notion of what? asked Hale,
very quickly, put me up to the notion of
what!
Of courting this girl, to be sure,
answered
Spencer. But let us say no more
about it. Come, let us go to breakfast.
You forget that I told you yesterday
at Barnsley that my eye was upon her
you forget
Yes, to be sure he does, interrupted
St. Maur, or rather he pretends to forget,
to get off betting. He knows as well as
we do that you
will
win her.
I know nothing of the sort! I know
that he will not.
Once again, will you bet? said Sir
Edward
,
who was growing almost angry.
If you insist upon it, yes.
I say, then, that I will have her
openly
as my mistress within one week from
this day.
I understand you perfectly, and take
the converse. For how much?
For anything you please, from one to
five thousand.
Oh! oneone is enough; for one
thousand be it. It is a bet!
Very well, there is an end of that
then let us go to breakfast; and here
comes Percy Harbottle, and he took
several quick steps forward in advance of
the rest, to greet him. As he did so
Spencer fell back to St. Maur a pace or
two, and whispered in his ear
You stand my lose to him, if I should
lose the bet; as it is most likely that I
shall.
Yes, yes! I understand it so, said
the other, but come on quickly, or he
will see us whispering together, and
suspect
something.
And overtaking him, they all walked
on together, and entered the breakfast
room, joking and laughing merrily.
CHAPTER IX.
Breakfast
passed joyously and gaily, no
more allusions were made to the bets,
Spencer carefully avoiding the subject, as
if he thought that he might give offence
by continuing it; but St. Maur and
Harbottle
continued to expatiate upon the
charms of Rose Castleton, the felicity of
the man who should have the luck to
gain her, and the certainty of its giving
him the greatest eclat of any one in
London
,
to produce her in the parks, or at
the theatre, as a part of his menage.
As soon as breakfast was over, while
St. Maur and Spencer excused themselves
for the purpose of writing a few letters,
Edward with Percy Harbottle walked
round the grounds, and visited the stalls,
and the kennels, and the mews of the
falcons
;
and finally set to amusing
themselves
by making the grooms ride the
hunters in succession backward and
forward
over a high leaping bar.
While thus employed they were joined
by the others, and the question was put,
how the day was to be spent, until
dinner
time.
Oh! confound dinner! replied
Spencer
;
I hate your regular two o'clock
dinner, it so thoroughly breaks up the
day. Let us go out and hawk or shoot, if
Sir Edward likes my plan, all day; taking
some ale and cold meat with us, and
come home to a good early supper, and
we will have another bout at the
Burgundy
.
What say you, worthy host of mine?
That is a bright thought, and a right
good plan, answered Hale. I am like
you; I hate your ceremonious dinner so
early in the day, and I love your
extemporaneous
sylvan meal on the green turf,
under the shady trees, or beside some
clear and bubbling runnel.
Yes, answered St. Maur, or in some
jolly farmer's house, with his pretty
daughter to pour out the ale, and kiss you
behind the door, when the father is
looking
the other way.
A loud laugh followed this
characteristic
speech; and then they began to
inquire
what should be the order of the day,
and it was speedily decided that they
would shoot rabbits in the park, in
preference
to hawking in the meadows, or
fishing in the streamand Eversley being
called in to name a farm-house situated
conveniently for taking the mid-day meal,
suggested, not altogether unexpectedly to
Edward Hale, nor without having
pocketed beforehand a handsome fee for
his advice, suggested farmer Castleton's.
Ha! ha! Then we shall see the pretty
Rose againhey, Ned? said St. Maur.
And Percy Harbottle will have a
chance of entering the lists, if he will,
said Spencer.
No, no! replied Harbottle, every
lad to his own lass. I stick to my
promise
;
he gave me a good chance with a
pretty girl yesterday, and hang me if I
cross him to-day.
In a few moments they were all
equipped
,
and ready for the sport,
accompanied
by servants with hunting-poles to
beat the bushes, and spaniels to start the
game, and boys with spare ammunition,
and all means and appliances for a blithe
day's sport.
Taking their way across the trout
stream, and through the dense oak grove,
they crossed the tall castle hill, and going
out by a postern in the brick wall of the
park, entered a deep and hollow road,
between
high banks of sand, crested on
either hand by the walls of the home park
and the deer-parkand overshadowed by
the rich foliage of the huge oaks, which
almost crossed their branches overhead,
and made the lane at noonday almost as,
dark as midnight. A second postern, at
a short distance up the lane, gave access
to the deer-parka wild tract of barren
broken land, with many gulleys and
ravines
,
each watered by its gushing
streamlet
,
each clothed with feathery
brushwood
and tall fern, among which the
grey burrowers they came in pursuit of
squatted by hundreds.
At a short distance from the double
portions
,
they caught a glimpse, as they
crossed the road, of a large rambling brick
farm-house, with tall fantastic pinnacles,
and the twisted chimneys of the
Elizabethan
style, peering from out the shade
of the dark oaks, and abutting on the
deer-park
wall.
There is the home farm, said the
keeperold Castleton's, you know, Sir
Edward; I sent the boys up with the
wine, and word we would be there at
two hours past noon; and he says, if you
please, Sir Edward, he will be very blithe
to see you, and they will have the goose
pie ready.
A capital thing, too, is a good goose
pie, said Hale, and we will find
appetites
conformable, I'll warrant it. Now,
give me my gun, for here we are upon
the ground, and so let loose the spaniels.
Are they steady, Mark?
No steadier in England, your honor,
answered the keeper, than the two black
King Charles! they are worth fifty
guineas
any day, of any gentleman's gold!
I'll be judged by these gentlemen if they
be notalthough I say it who should not,
seeing it was I who broke them.
The game was abundant, the day
prosperous, the young marksmen in
good cue; the dogs behaved well, the
shooting was extremely good, and the
sport undeniable, for above a hundred
rabbits had been bagged by the three guns
before the hour indicated for their rustic
dinner was announced, by the long keen
blast of a bugle, strongly and scientifically
winded, from the porch of the
neighboring
farm-house.
There goes old Castleton, cried Hale,
he was the huntsman to my father's
pack, many years since! That says that
the goose pie is ready.
Leaving the brakes wherein they had
been shooting, a short walk brought them
to the well stocked and hospitable
farm-house
,
where blunt old fashioned English
hospitality received them, with its cheery
and unceremonious welcome. The goose
pie was pronounced excellent, and such
justice done to it as showed the praise
was sincere; the home-brewed ale as
clear as amber, as mild as milk, and
almost
as strong as brandy, was duly
honored
;
and, above all, as Edward expected,
lovely Rose Castleton was therelooking,
he thought even lovelier than before, in
her tight fitting russet jacket, and short
blue petticoat, with her beautiful round
arms bare nearly to the shoulder, and her
trim shapely ankles, displayed by her
brief draperies.
There was, however, something in
Rose's manner that Hale did not
understand
;
she would not talk much to him,
nor jest at all; yet many a stolen glance
met hisnow dwelling boldly, now as
coquettishly averted; still he could not
exactly make it out, until, as her father
turned aside to speak to St. Maur, she
cast her eye quickly towards the old
man, and laid her finger on her lips.
Frank Hunter, with the wonted
indiscretion
of men and lovers, under such
circumstances, had been to see her that
morning; and, like a fool as he was,
instead
of coaxing, had reproached and
harassed her; and, concluding by
calling
for her father's interposition, had
procured
her a sound seolding, in set terms,
for her flirtiness and vanity in fancying
that a gentleman like Sir Edward would
demean himself so much as to look at her.
In truth, between the fascinations of the
young lord of the manor, the sulky and
unflattering resentment of her lover, and
the most injudicious violence of her
father, who really had not the least
suspicion
that Hale was thinking about his
daughter, and fancied that it was merely
an absurd whim of the girl's, to tease
Frank Hunterin truth, Rose Castleton
was in dread peril of going irretrievably
astray.
Nothing of any moment passed; nor
could Sir Edward find any opportunity of
speaking to the poor girl alone until when
the dinner was finished, and they were
returning to their sports; after they had
all quitted the house with the old farmer,
he made a plea of having left his shot
pouch, and ran back himself, before any
one could anticipate him, to fetch it. He
found, as he expected, Rose Castleton
alone, looking out of the window after
them. As he entered the garden gate she
looked round, and seeing the shot bag,
guessed, with a woman's rapid wit, what
it meantcaught it up, and stepped out
into the porch to meet him.
There were two servant girls removing
the dinner things in the hall, and, as if
accidentally, she pulled the heavy door
to after her. The porch was deep and
projecting, and, as Hale entered it, he
cast a quick glance round to see if he was
observed, but all was safe!
The very air of Rose, her heighteued
color, the quickened motion of her bosom,
and the trembling of her small hand,
showed that she was not all
unconscious
.
I thank you, Rose, he said quite
aloud, in order to be overheard; that is
just what I came back for.
But, with the words, he caught her
round the waist with both his arms, and
pressed her soft and panting bosom to
his owntook one long kiss from her
unreluctant
lips, and whispered, You will
come, Rose, you will come, dearest Rose,
to-night?
Be sure I will, she repliedif they
will let meif I can slip away; but
but, she added, with an arch smile, you
must promise that you will not harm
me.
Before he could reply, however, the old
man's step was heard without; and
putting
her fingers up to her rosy lips, and
blowing him a kiss, she vanished. The
door clapped heavily, and, making as if
it had closed on his own exit, Edward
walked out with the pouch in his hand,
spoke a few words to the old man, and
hurried on to join his comrades.
They returned to their sport,but the
mind of Edward was too much engrossed
by other matters; his heart beat thick and
fasthis head was unsteadyhe missed
four or five fair shots in succession; and
his friends laughed at him; but he bore
all their jeering in good part, and laughed
in his turn, at them, as he told them that
He laughed the loudest who laughed
last! Look out, he added, look out
for your thousand, captain!
Ha! is it so? said Spencer, has she
made an appointment?
For nine o'clock to-night!
Hurrah! cried St. Maur. Hurrah!
we shall do the captainI knew we
should. Halloa! there goes a rabbit,
right from between my legs! and he
took a quick sight and fired.
Their shooting was continued until the
shades of evening had begun fairly to set
in; and then, with their shooting ponies
fairly laden with the quantity of game
they had shot, their dogs almost tired out,
and themselves in the highest possible
spirits, they returned homeward to supper,
Just as they came in sight of the house,
the first bell was ringing out clearly and
merrily, so that there was little time to
spare before the social meal should be set
on the boardand this little Captain
Spencer, determined that Edward should
have no more time for quiet
consideration
,
contrived to make still less, by
detaining
him some minutes on the steps of
the hall door, in frivolous conversation.
Then starting suddenly, as if he had
forgotten himself, he saidUpon my
word! we shall scarce have five minutes
to make our ablutions. Now, pray, lose
no time, my dear Sir Edward, for I am
perilous hungry.
Not I, faith, answered the baronet,
running up stairs in high gleeI will
be with you in five minutes.
Then Spencer turned round, with a
quiet smile, to St. Maur, and said
The game is won!that is to say, if
you have not made any blunder in your
letter to Delaval. I wish I had found time
to see it before you sent it off. Mine to
Davenant was a master-piece! Not a
word that could be contradicted; yet not
a word that might not be construed into
anything.
I think, for my part, that the game is
lost! Here is this silly wench going to
meet him quietly to-night. He wins her
almost without wooingwearies of her
as soon as she is wonand there's an
end of the whole thing, and no one the
wiser.
That is all you know about it! and,
true enough, that is all that would come
of it, if there were no head wiser than
your own to arrange it.
How is it, then? How
Never you mind. It is all well, that
is enough for you. Go away now, and
prepare yourself for supper.
It was not twenty minutes before to the
light-hearted sports of the day the
excitement
of the lighted hall succeededthe
sumptuous supperthe rich and genial
winesthe frolic mirththe graceful
revelry
the
voluptuous songthe
licentious
boasting. Now there was nothing
of the gross and low debauchery which
had rendered the orgies of the past night
disgusting to every refined and gentle
spirit; now there was nothing coarse or
boisterous or obscene; wine flowed, it is
true, liberally, but not to excess; now
there was present everything that could
excite and stimulate, and nothing that
could jar upon or disgust the senses.
So passed the evening, until the hour
drew nigh for the host's appointment, and
then, easily excused, Sir Edward stole
away to the rendezvous in the low Monk's
Coppice.
That night, although they waited for
him, and revelled late, his friends saw
nothing
of their host; and when, two hours
past midnight, they adjourned, they were
informed by the house-steward that Sir
Edward, not being well at ease, had been
a-bed these four hours.
I told you so, whispered Spencer, I
told you he would not get her very easily.
Good night! good night! to-morrow will
play out the game.
The morrow came, and when the party
were assembled at the breakfast table, the
brow of Edward Hale was so dark and
moody, that from this alone it was
evident
he must have been disappointed; but
this it did not suit his guests to perceive,
and as soon as he entered the apartment,
St. Maur, who was awaiting him, cried
out, with a merry laugh
Why this is the very insolence of
conquest
,
Ned. They tell me that you were
abed at ten o'clock; was not the lovely
Rose worth one hour's attention?
Tush! answered the young baronet,
sharply; damnation on it! she did not
come at all. Instead of Rose, I met that
great brute, Mark Eversley, at the place,
to tell me she was watched, and could not
get out to meet me. And now, to wind
up the whole, her old dotard of a father
has been here, as soon as it was light this
morning, with Frank Hunter, to ask my
sanction for her marriage, on the day after
to-morrow. He did not directly tell me
so, but it is quite clear that she had
told him everything, for he talked about a
love-quarrel with her betrothed husband,
and her flightiness, and coquetting with
some other man to punish him! And
how sorry she was now, and how much
she repented of her misconduct, and how
willing Frank was to forgive her, and
how anxious he was himself to marry her
at once to the man she loved, lest
scandal
,
and perhaps worse should come of it.
Pshaw! pshaw! that is the merest
humbug
.
They have found you out somehow
or other, and have been badgering the girl
out of her wits. It is as clear as daylight
that she loves you, and would rather be
your mistress than that bumpkin's wife.
Only do not despair, and you shall have
her yet.
No, no! replied Hale, bitterly, no
St. Maurno! it is impossible. By all
the powers of hell! she is lost to me
altogether
,
and for ever; and IIby the Lord
that lives! I would give half my fortune,
half my life to win her.
Nonsense, man, nonsense, replied St.
Maur, why the deuce should she be lost
to you! It will never do to give it up
thus. Why Spencer will win our two
thousand guineas; I suppose that does not
signify to you, who are as rich as Crsus,
but it is everything to me, who have not
been a minor eighteen years, with ten
thousand pounds per annum to
accumulate
.
Why, what the devil would you have
me do, man? answered Sir Edward,
angrily
;
I tell you I would give ten
thousand
pounds to win her.
Then why don't you win her,
baronet
?
said Speneer, laughing. I could
do it, for a twentieth part of the sum.
Oh, you mean buy her, I suppose; buy
her of the father, or the bridegroom! But
you would be very much mistaken if you
were to try that game. You would be
pretty sure to get your head broken with a
quarter-staff for your pains.
Indeed, I mean nothing of the kind,
said he; but I could do it.
How? how? I will do anything
anything in the world to win her.
You forget, baronet, that I have bet
against you; and it is hardly likely that I
should help you to win my own money.
Oh, I have lost the bet; I have lost the
bet fairly, for I have consented to her
marrying
Hunter, replied Edward. I had
given up all hopes of success, and,
indeed
,
had filled up a draft in your name
on my goldsmith, before I came down
stairs; here it is, Captain Spencer. Now
we are straight on that score. So you are
free to help me now. How would you
win her?
Why, by a little gentle violence. Carry
her off, to be sure, answered Spencer,
pocketing the draft.
More easily said, that, than done!
answered Hale.
Oh, you are youngyou are young,
replied the other. Give me the
necessary
orders, and I will arrange it all for
you in the twinkling of an eye.
I will give you anything you please,
captain, answered the baronet, very
quickly, if you will show me how you
can do it
Well, just sit down at that table. You
are a magistrate, are you not?
Yes; what of that?
Everythingeverything! Just sit
down, and write me an order to take in
charge Francis Hunter, as a poacher, or
vagabond, or anything you please, and
to put him on board my frigateand I
will do it this very nightif I take him
out of his own house.
But how will you get the force?
Never you mind. I have got force
nearer than you think for. My frigate lies
in the Southampton river, and perhaps my
heutenant and a gang are nearer at hand
than she is. Perhaps I brought them
hither with a view to some fun for
myself
;
you need not inquire. In these
times the king's very good friends, as I
am, can do a great many very funny
things. Only do you give me the order,
and tell me where to catch Master Frank,
and he shall find himself to-morrow night
under hatches of the good ship Royal Oak,
instead of being under a coverlet with a
bonny bride. And, if he needs must be
married, my boatswain shall be parson,
and tie him up to the gunner's daughter.
A saucy scoundrel, to interfere thus with
his betters.
That is soon done, said Hale, who
was now thoroughly maddened between
passion, rivalry, and disappointment,
that is soon done, and with the words
he drew an order, signed it, and gave it to
Spencer; and for the rest, there is no
difficulty in getting hold of Hunter. He
told me himself that he should ride to
Alresford
this evening, to buy the wedding
ring, or some such foolery, and return
homeward by the forest road ere midnight;
I will show you where you may post your
men, and catch himand what then?
Why, then, you shall ride out with
me, and show me the spot; and then go
on and call to pay your respects on the
good Earl of Rochefort; and, if he press
you, stay dinner with him. Then you
must let Mark Eversley show St. Maur
which is the window of the girl's
bedchamber
,
and he must have the carriage
waiting in some safe place by the park
wall, and carry off the girl for you, and
the seandal of that will fall on him, not on
you; and he has earned so good a
repntation
for such deeds, that one more or
less will make no difference to him; and
as for Hunter, I will not post my men
until
sunset, and when the job is done will
return quietly to the Hall, and no one will
be a word the wiser, until a three years'
cruise is over, and by that time the whole
thing will be forgotten.
Excellent! excellent! exclaimed Sir
Edward. And as I return from,
Rochefort's
,
I will meet St. Maur in the carriage,
have a sham quarrel with him, and bring
her back to her father's as her rescuer.
And so secure a two-hour's
tte--tte
with
her in the first place, in which, of course,
you can overcome all her scruples, if she
have any, and win her for your mistress
under her father's very nose; and that,
too, with his everlasting gratitude to you
for saving her from this vile profligate.
Ah! you are a cunning fellow, Hale; and,
before many years, will be as deep a hand
as myself, I warrant, you.
It needed little time to arrange all
their schemes of iniquity, in due form, and
with every probability of success; and
then, when all was planned, St. Maur and
Harbottle set out to fish the stream; while
Spencer and the young lord of the manor
rode out together, the former, as he gave it
out, to carry letters to the post at Barnsley,
the latter to pay his respects to the Earl of
Rochefort; but it was a matter of some
little
surprise to the household that they took
no attendants with them, and that they
ordered
a late supper, saying that they
should neither of them be home until near
midnight.
CHAPTER X.
Throughout
that day everything went
on well for the conspirators: Spencer had
reconnoitred the ground thoroughly, as
he rode out with his friend in the
morning
;
had found his lieutenant with the
men, as he expected, at Barnsley; and had
given them his instructions so skilfully
that he felt well assured no suspicion
could in any case fall upon him as the
perpetrator
of the meditated ontrage, until he
should himself choose to reveal his agency
in the matter.
Meanwhile, Sir Edward Hale had
galloped
onward, without giving his mind
time to cool from the turmoil of fierce
passion
which was still raging there, to Kings
ton castle, the seat of the Earl of Rochefort;
and there, too, everything had happened
to his liking, for shortly after his arrival a
furious thunder-storm arose, and lasted so
long that he was pressed, as he desired to
be, to stay for dinner, and no plea was
left him for refusing the kindly and
oft-urged
invitation.
Thus passed the day, unmarked by
anything
of moment, and night came on
untimely
for the season, and boisterons, and
unpleasant, and in all respects suited to
the purposes of the conspirators. Few
men were likely to be abroad on such a
night, if it were not on urgent business;
for it had been a dim grey misty evening
since the thunder-storm, with every now
and then a violent burst of cold and wintry
rain; the wind howled fearfully among the
tree-tops, and the chimneys of the manor,
and it was withal so dark and black, that
long before midnight a man could not
have seen his hand at a yard before his
face.
This storm had afforded Spencer a fair
excuse for dining at the little Inn at
Barnsley
;
while his men went off singly, or in
small parties so as to pass unnoticed, to
rendezvous at a well known and
conspicuous
landmark, the Battle Pillar, as it was
called, a large block of grey granite,
commemorative
of some event long since
forgotten
,
standing, by the wayside, on a
large waste common covered with fern and
bushes, and interspersed with pools and
pits full of water, where they were to be
joined by their officers in the course of the
night, and receive further orders.
Hale had, however, some difficulty in
escaping from the hospitalities of the
castle
,
in consequence of the unusual
inclemency
of the night; and it was only by
alleging the presence of his guests at
home, as an insurmountable obstacle to his
remaining all night, that he was enabled
to avoid the well meant persecutions of
the old lord.
After that, he had another struggle to
undergo, before he could get away
without
accepting the escort of a half a dozen of
the earl's blue coated serving men, whom
it would have very ill-suited him to take
along with him that night; but finally,
when it was nearly ten o'clock, he
succeeded
in making good his retreat, and
began
to ride rapidly towards the place
appointed
.
Eleven o'clock struck from many a
village
steeple, and quarter elapsod after
quarter, and now it was almost on the
stroke of twelve, and all things were
prepared
for actiona carriage, one of the
lightest of the ponderous vehicles of that
day, with four strong horses harnessed to
it, stood in a hollow way close to the
postern
gate in the park wall, sheltered from
observation by the dense shadows of the
overhanging trees, ready to bear off Rose
to London so soon as she should be seized
by the ruffians appointed for that task
under
the orders of Lord Henry St. Maur.
Meantime the gang of sailors, well armed,
with bludgeons, pistols, and cutlasses, lay
hid in the dark thickets by the side of the
Alresford road, with Captain Spencer and
his first lientenant; while guarded by
three men, in a low charcoal burner's
shed, long since deserted, on the skirts of
the forestland, and scarcely half a mile
distant, a light taxed cart, with two swift
horses attached to it, tandem-fashion, was
in waiting to bear the captured yeoman
to his floating prison.
The times had been calculated closely
and all, so far, had gone successfully.
Frank Hunter was even now jogging
homeward, as the leaders of the
press-gang
anticipated, with a full purse and
happy heart, from the distant
market-town
;
and now Lord Henry, with his
ruffians
,
was actually at his post by the lonely
farm, and consulting his repeater ere he
should give the word to plant the ladder
against the chamber window of the
innocent
girl, who slept, all unsuspicious and
unconscions, the calm, soft sleep of
youthful happiness.
Sir Edward Hale, however, was ill at
ease and anxious; he was too young in
evilhe had too much of actual goodness
in his compositionwas too unhardened
in the road of siu, not to feel many a
twinge of conscience, many a keen
compunctious
visitation. He, too, was now
near the place of actionhe had already
ridden many miles since leaving the
castle, where he had spent the day; and
his heart, fearfully agitated, began to turn
almost sick within him, as he was now
rapidly approaching the point on the
great London road whereat, an hour or
two later, he was to meet the carriage
bearing his destined mistress from her
terrified and grieving family.
He had, as I have said already, felt full
many a prick of conscience, full many a
touch of half repentant sorrow; but still,
whenever he made up his mind to turn
from the evil of the way in which he was
going, as he did many times that night,
dreadthat false dread which so often
drives frail man to crime and sorrow
dread, I mean, of the mockery and
langhter
of his more hardened comrades,
prevailed
,
and hindered him from turning his
head homeward, and countermanding the
preparation of those base outrages.
Still, though he dared not halt in the
career of sinthough he felt that he
could
not, even though he would, repenthe
was sad, moody, and reluctant; and he
rode onward slowly, guiding his horse
with an irresolute and feeble hand through
the blind darkness. He was now two or
three miles only distant from the station
at the cross-roads, which had been fixed
upon as the spot where he was to
overtake
the carriage, and enact the part of
Rose's rescuer from St. Maur and his
myrmidons
.
He was just in the act of
crossing
the bridle-road which led from the
market-town, when Hunter was
returning
,
past the wild forest-land skirting his
own park, wherein the press-gang was
patiently awaiting the appearance of the
young yeoman.
The London road, after it crossed the
narrow track in question, mounted the
brow of a short bold hill, and dived at
once into a deep and shadowy dingle, with
a large brook, which had been swollen by
that night's rain into a wild and foaming
torrent, threading the bottom of the dell.
The brook, which lay between the rocky
banks, was spanned at this place by a
rude wooden bridge, that had, for some
time past, been gradually falling into ruin;
and scarce two hours before the time at
which Sir Edward reached the spot, the
whole of the weak fabric had been swept
away by the swollen torrent.
At the cross road the youthful baronet
paused, even longer than before, and
doubtedyes, greatly doubtedwhether
he should not alter, even now, his
purpose
;
but, as he did so, the distant clatter
of a hoof came down the horse-road from
the direction of Alresfordand, instantly
suspecting that the traveller could be no
other than Frank Hunter, he dashed his
spurs into his horse's side, and galloped
furiously across the hill, and down the
steep descent, towards the yawning chasm,
fearful of being seen, under these
circumstances
,
by the man on whom he was
preparing
to inflict an injury so fearful.
Down the steep track he drove furiously
headlongspurring his noble hunter
on! on! as if he were careering in full
flightflight from that fearful fury, a
self-tormenting
conscience; which; to borrow
the imagery of the Latin lyristClimbs
to the deck of the brazen galley, and
mounts on the croupe of the flying
horseman
!
On he came! on! Now he was at the
brink of the dread precipice! One other
bound would have precipitated horse and
man together into the dark abyss! But
the horse bounded not; he saw, almost
too late, the frightful space, and stood
with his feet rooted to the verge, stock
still, even as a sculptured image! stock
still from his furious gallop, even at the
chasm's brink!
Headlong was Edward Hale launched
by the shock into the flooded stream; and
well was it for him that the stream
was
so
wildly flooded; for had he fallen on the
rocks, which in ordinary weather lay bare
and black in the channel, he had been
dashed to atoms.
Deep! deep he sank into the whirling
eddiesbut he rose instantly to the
surface
,
and struck out lightly for his life! for
he was both a bold and active swimmer.
At the same instant he shouted loudly
wildlyso as no man can shout who is
not in such desperate extremityagain
and again for succor!
Just at this moment the moon came
out bright from the scattered clouds,
and showed him all the perils of his
state, but showed him no way to
escape
them, so steeply did the rocks tower
above his headso wildly did the torrent
whirl him upon its mad and foaming
waters
.
Again he shoutedand againand once
he thought his shout was answered; fainter
he waxed and fainter; he sankrose
sank, and rose again; a deadlier and more
desperate strugglea wilder yell for help,
and the water rushed into his mouth, and
a flash reeled across his eyes, and he was
floating helplesslyhopelessly down the
gulf, when a strong arm seized him, and
dragged him to the bank; for he had
drifted through the gorge, and the stream
flowed here through low and level
meadows
.
A little space he lay there
senseless
,
and then, by the kind and
attentive
energies of his rescuer, he was
brought back to lifeand his first glance,
as his soul returned to him, feil on the frank
face of the man who had preserved him!
That man was Frank Hunter! All
Edward
Hale's best feelings rushed back in a
flood upon himhe started to his knee!
I thank thee! he cried fervently
with all my soul I thank thee, mighty,
Almighty Lord! that thou hast saved me
not from this death alone, but from this
deadly sin!
And, seeing Hunter's hand, he poured
into his half incredulous and all bewildered
ear the storythe confessionof his dark
meditated crime.
But there is timethere is yet time, he
cried, the horses! where are the horses?
Here! here, Sir Edward, cried the
stout yeoman; I caught your hunter as I
came along, and tied him with my
hackney
to a tree here at the hill foot.
A moment, and they were both in the
saddle, furiously spurring towards a
crossroad
,
which led directly to the place
where we have seen the carriage, and
leaving the press-gang far behind them;
for Hunter had quitted his homeward
track on hearing Sir Edward's cry for help,
and so avoided that danger. A second
bridge, a little lower down the river, soon
gave them the means of crossing it and
regaining the high road; and they were
nearing the lane by which the carriage
must come up, at every stride of their
horses; and there was now no longer any
doubt but they were in good time. Just
as they were about to turn, however,
down the oft-mentioned lane, they were
arrested by the clang of several horses at
a gallop, coming down the great road from
London, so as to meet them, and by a
shout
Stand! stand! and tell us the road to
Arrington!
Edward Hale answered in a moment,
for he knew the voice. Good God!
Lord Arthur, is that you?
Hale! Heaven be praised, cried the
new comer; then I am in luck. But
what the deuce are you doing here? and
who is this with you? Where are St.
Maur and Spencer?
I will tell you another timeI will tell
you another time, Arthur Asterly, replied
Sir Edward; for it was Lady Fanny's
brother
an
officer in the Life Guardswho,
at his sister's entreaty, had ridden down
post-haste. Come with me, quick!
come with me and see me repair a great
intended wrong!
One minutefor I
must
tell you now
what I have ridden post from town to tell
you. I was just off guard at Windsor
when Fan sent for me, and I have not had
time to take off my uniform! You are the
dupe of a set of scoundrels! Spencer and
St. Maur have been urging you to a great
offence, for their own evil ends! and,
grieved I am to say it, with my mother's
cognisance. They thought themselves
very cunning with their anonymous letters
and base schemes to make Fan think you
a villain; but Fan and I detected them in
no time; and, I thank God! it has been
the meaus of bringing my poor father to his
senses; and he would have thrown up the
cursed marquisate, which was the price of
all this kuaverybut the king, for all the
evil they speak of him, has acted nobly
nobly! I saw him myself, and told him
the whole story, and he wrote a manly and
generous letter, in his own hand, restoring
the pledge he had given to that seoundrel,
Davenant! and I have come down here,
post-haste, to save youand I am time
eneugh to do soam I not, dear Ned?
Sir Edward was saved ere you came,
my lordif I may be so bold as to speak
to you, who are a great gentleman. His
own good heart and good feelings saved
him, cried the bold yeoman, half crying
with the violence of his emotions.
I am afraid not, said Sir Edward,
unwilling
to take any crecit he did not
deserve
;
it was chance only, or rather
Providence
a
blessed accidentand
gratitude
to this good man for his timely
service
!
But for him, Arthur, I should be
dead nowdead in the perpetration of a
cowardly base crime!
Well, God be praised that you are
saved by any means, cried Lord Arthur,
but let us gallop on, if there is anything
to do!
Much, much! there is much to do,
answered Hale; follow, follow!and,
putting spurs to his horse, he dashed down
the lane towards the brick farm-house.
They reached it in time; reached it
just as Rose Castleton, fainting between
surprise and terrorfor the girl's head and
not her heart had been led astray, and her
repentance had been realwas thrust into
the carriage by the hand of Henry St.
Maur.
St. Maur! cried Edward, springing
from his horse, as he arrived on the spot,
St. Maur, you are a villain! You drove
me into this for your own evil ends; but
all your villanies are discoveredand you
may thank God, if you believe that there
is a God, that no more harm has come of it.
And, lifting Rose respectfully out of the
carriage, he placed her in the arms of her
chosen bridegroom, saying, Here, take
her, Huntertake her! I give her to
you, and will give you her dowry
to-morrow
take
her, God bless you, and be
happy!
Sir. Edward Hale, you shall answer
to me for this, by heaven! cried St. Maur
fariously.
When you will, my lord, when you
will!
Then now, now! exclaimed St.
Maur, I say now!and he unsheathed
his rapier ere the words were out of his
mouth. Sir Edward Hale followed his
example on the instant; and before any
one could interpose, their blades were
crossed. It was almost too dark for sword
play, but the lamps of the carriage were
lighted, and the inmates of the farm had
by this time run out, with several torches
and lanterus, so that the gleam of the
weapons could be distinguished in this
glimmering light.
The young baronet fought only on the
defensive, St. Maur thrusting at him with
insane and revengeful rashness, so that
Edward might have killed him two or
three times, had he been so minded. But,
at the fourth or fifth pass, the young lord's
foot slipped on the wet greeusward, and
he fell his full length, breaking his small
sword as he did so.
Take your life. Take your life, my
lord, and mend it, said Edward, putting
up his sword.
Sullenly the young nobleman arose, and
shook the hilt of his broken blade at the
victor.
You will repent of this! he said; and,
snatching the rein of one of the servants'
horses, which stood near, he sprang to its
back, and galloping off towards the hall
was quickly lost in the swart darkness.
But Edward Hale never did repent it.
A pause ensned of some moments after
his departure, which was at length broken
by Lord Arthur Asterly, who said, Well,
we had better all go quietly home to our
beds now; and to-morrow we can talk
over these things at our leisure; that is to
say, if it be not the better plan to bury
them all in oblivion; for, by the blessing
of Providence, there has no harm befallen
any one, and I think the adventures of this
night are over. So send away the
carriage
,
Ned, and your people; and let us
two trot to the hall together, for I have a
good many private explanations for your
ear; and we will not hurry, for it is just as
well to let those scoundrels have time to
evacuate the premises. I do not think
they will have the impudence to wait for
our coming.
But the adventures of the evening were
not over. For, unhappily, Spencer, having
grown weary of waiting with his men, left
them in charge of the lientenant, and came
galloping up to the entrance of the hall in
one direction, just as St. Maur arrived
there from another, bareheaded, his dress
covered with clay, and his seabbard empty
by his side.
Ho! St. Maur, said the captain, as he
saw him, what does all this mean?
Whence do you come in this array?
Where is Sir Edward?
It means, sir, replied St. Maur
furiously
,
for he was in the mood to wreak
his spite on any one who happened to be
near him, that Arthur Asterly has come
down post from London, and all is
discovered
,
and we are a brace of fools and
villains!
Speak for yourself, pray, my good
lord! With regard to yourself I have no
doubt you are perfectly right
you
must
know best, said Spencer, in the most
eoolly irritating manner. But I allow no
man to apply such words to me.
You will have to fight half the world,
then, captain, answered St. Maur, seeing
the folly of quarrelling with his own
confederate
,
for everything is blownblown
to the four winds!
Then Hale has given up the wench?
Given her up! to be sure he has!
given her to the farmer fellow; and called
me a villain to my teeth! We fought, and
but that I fell and broke my sword, I
would have
Done wonders, doubtless! interrupted
Spencer. But see here, if I understand
you aright, I win a cool thousand of you!
You bet me that Hale would have this
cursed wench, within a fortnight, for his
mastress. Now, as I mean to make
myself
scarce, and to keep myself on board
my frigate until this blows over, you may
as well book up.
Why, Spencer, exclaimed St. Maur,
you forget
Indeed, I forget nothing! did you not
make the bet?
Just at this moment Harbottle, who
knew not a word of what had been
passing
,
disturbed by their loud voices, came
out upon the terrace, with several servants
bearing lights, and every word that
followed
was heard by all of them.
I did; but did we not understand that
it was to be drawn in case?
Not I, my lordnot I, my lord; I never
play child's play. When I bet, I bet; and
wlien I win, I expect to be paid. Now
the question is, will you pay me?
No, sir, I will not, for you have not
won it. You are cheating me.
My lord!
Yes, sir, you
are
cheating me, ex
claimed St. Maur fiercely. You
are
cheating
me, or trying to do so! You are
Quite enough said, my lord, answered
Spencer, perfectly composed. You heard
him, Harbottle; you heard what he said.
Now, my Lord Henry St. Maur, in my
mind the quicker these things are settled
the better. My pistols are in my holsters
loaded; yours are doubtless the sameif
not, take your choice of mine!
It was in vain that Harbottle, that the
servants, would have interposedboth
were determined, obstinate, ynyielding!
Ten paces were stepped off upon the
terracethe reluctant servants were
compelled
to advance the torcheseach took
a weapon in his hand, and to prevent
worse horrorfor they swore that if balked
they would fight muzzle to the breast, and
give the word themselvesHarbottle gave
the signal.
The pistols flashed at oncebut one
report was heardand ere that reached
the ears of the spectators, St. Maur
sprang up a yard into the air, and fell to
the ground dead, with the bullet in his
brain!
At this moment the approaching sounds
of Sir Edward and his friend were heard,
quickened by the pistol shots. Spencer's
keen ear first canght them; and, as he
sprang to his horse, he took a sealed
package, undirected, out of the bosom of
his coat, and threw it to Harbottle,
exclaiming
,
Give that to Edward Haleit
is hisand say I am sorry for what has
passed; for to him, at least, I owe no ill
will.
It was the order to arrest Frank Hunter,
under Sir Edward's hand and seal; but
before
Harbottle had raised it from the
ground, the homicide was out of sight,
and the young baronet came upon the
ground with Lord Arthur Asterly.
The fall of the guilty and unhappy St.
Maur was the catastrophe of this
romance
for
a romance it was of domestic
life!and like all other romances, it ended
in a marriage!
From that day forth Sir Edward Hale
was a better and a wiser man!from that
day forth sin had no more any permanent
dominion over him! No obstacle now
opposed his union, in due season, with
charming Fanny Asterlyand with his
sweet wife and a fair and noble family
for God smiled upon his marriagehe
lived long and happily among his happy
tenants; and when he died the country
people mourned him, as the good Lord
of the Manor!
THE END.
