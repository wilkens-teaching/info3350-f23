EDGAR HUNTLY;
OR,
MEMOIRS OF A SLEEP-WALKER.
CHAPTER XX.
I likewise
burned with
impatience
to know the condition of my
family, to dissipate at once their
tormenting
doubts and my own, with regard to
our mutual safety. The evil that I
feared had befallen them was too
enormous
to allow me to repose in suspense,
and my restlessness and ominous
forebodings
would be more intolerable than
any hardship or toils to which I could
possibly be subjected during this journey.
I was much refreshed and invigorated
by the food that I had taken, and by the
rest of an hour. With this stock of
recruited force I determined to scale the
hill. After receiving minute directions,
and returning many thanks for my
hospitable
entertainment, I set out.
The path was indeed intricate, and
deliberate attention was obliged to be
exerted in order to preserve it. Hence
my progress was slower than I wished.
The first impulse was to fix my eye upon
the summit, and to leap from crag to
crag till I reached it, but this my
experience
had taught me was impracticable.
It was only by winding through gullies,
and coasting precipices and bestriding
chasms, that I could hope finally to gain
the top, and I was assured that by one
way only was it possible to accomplish
even this.
An hour was spent in struggling
with impediments, and I seemed to have
gained no way. Hence a doubt was
suggested whether I had not missed the
true road. In this doubt I was confirmed
by the difficulties which now grew up
before me. The brooks, the angles and
the hollows, which my hostess had
described
,
were not to be seen. Instead of
these, deeper dells, more headlong
torrents
and wider gaping rifts were
incessantly
encountered.
To return was as hoples as to proceed.
I consoled myself with thinking that
the survey which my informant had made
of the hill-side, might prove inaccurate,
and that in spite of her predictions, the
heights might be reached by other means
than by those pointed out by her. I
will not enumerate my toilsome
expedients
,
my frequent disappointments and
my desperate exertions. Suffice it to say
that I gained the upper space, not till
the sun had dipped beneath the horizon.
My satisfaction at accomplishing thus
much was not small, and I hied, with
renovated
spirits, to the opposite brow. This
proved to be a steep that could not be
descended. The river flowed at its
foot. The opposite bank was five
hundred
yards distant, and was equally
towering and steep as that on which I
stood. Appearances were adapted to
persuade you that these rocks had
formerly
joined, but by some mighty effort
of nature, had been severed, that the
stream might find way through the
chasm. The channel, however, was
encumbered
with asperities over which
the river fretted and foamed with
thundering
impetuosity.
I pondered for a while on these
stupendous
scenes. They ravished my
attention
from considerations that related
VOL. III. A
to myself; but this interval was short, and
I began to measure the descent, in order
to ascertain the practicability of treading
it. My survey terminated in bitter
disappointment
.
I turned my eye successively
eastward and westward. Solebury lay
in the former direction, and thither I
desired to go. I kept along the verge
in this direction, till I reached an
impassable
rift. Beyond this I saw that the
steep grew lower, but it was impossible
to proceed farther. Higher up the
descent
might be practicable, and though
more distant from Solebury, it was
better to reach the road, even at that
distance, than never to reach it.
Changing my course, therefore, I
explored the spaces above. The night
was rapidly advancing, the grey clouds
gathered in the south-east, and a chilling
blast, the usual attendent of a night in
October, began to whistle among the
pigmy cedars that scantily grew upon
these heights. My progress would
quickly
be arrested by darkness, and it
behoved
me to provide some place of shelter
and repose. No recess, better than an
hollow in the rock, presented itself to my
anxious scrutiny.
Meanwhile I would not dismiss the
hope of reaching the road, which I saw
some hundred feet below, winding along
the edge of the river, before daylight
should utterly fail. Speedily these hopes
derived new vigour from meeting a ledge
that irregularly declined from the brow of
the hill. It was wide enough to allow
of cautious footing. On a similar stratum,
or ledge, projecting still further from
the body of the hill, and close to the
surface
of the river, was the road. This
stratum ascended from the level of the
stream, while that on which I trod rapidly
descended. I hoped that they would
speedly be blended, or at least approach
so near as to allow me to leap from one to
the other without enormous hazard.
This fond expectation was frustrated.
Presently I perceived that the ledge
below began to descend, while that above
began to tend upward, and was quickly
terminated by the uppermost surface of
the cliff. Here it was needful to pause.
I looked over the brink and considered
whether I might not leap from my
present
station, without endangering my
limbs. The road into which I should
fall was a rocky pavement far from being
smooth. The descent could not be less
than forty or fifty feet. Such an attempt
was, to the last degree, hazardous, but
was it not better to risque my life by
leaping from this eminence, than to
remain and perish on the top of this
inhospitable mountain. The toils which
I had endured, in reaching this height
appeared to my panic-struck fancy, less
easy to be borne again than death.
I know not but that I should have
finally resolved to leap, had not different
views been suggested by observing that
the outer edge of the road was, in like
manner, the brow of a steep which
terminated
in the river. The surface of the
road, was twelve or fifteen feet above
the level of the stream, which, in this
spot was still and smooth. Hence I
inferred that the water was not of
inconsiderable
depth. To fall upon rocky
points was, indeed, dangerous, but to
plunge into water of sufficient depth,
even from an height greater than that
at which I now stood, especially to one to
whom habit had rendered water almost
as congenial an element as air, was
scarcely attended with inconvenience.
This expedient was easy and safe.
Twenty yards from this spot, the channel
was shallow, and to gain the road from
the stream, was no difficult exploit.
Some disadvantages, however,
attended
this scheme. The water was
smooth, but this might arise from some
other cause than its depth. My gun,
likewise, must be left behind me, and
that was a loss to which I felt invincible
repugnance. To let it fall upon the road,
would put it in my power to retrieve
the possession, but it was likely to be
irreparably injured by the fall.
While musing upon this expedient,
and weighing injuries with benefits, the
night closed upon me. I now considered
that should I emerge in safety from the
stream, I should have many miles to
travel before I could reach an house.
My clothes meanwhile would be loaded
with wet. I should be heart-pierced by
the icy blast that now blew, and my
wounds and bruises would be chafed
into insupportable pain.
I reasoned likewise on the folly of
impatience and the necessity of repose.
By thus long continuance in one posture,
my sinews began to stiffen, and my
reluctance
to make new exertions to encrease.
My brows were heavy, and I felt an
irresistible
propensity to sleep. I concluded
to seek some shelter, and resign myself,
my painful recollections, and my
mournful
presages to sweet forgetfulness. For
this end, I once more ascended to the
surface of the cliff. I dragged my weary
feet forward, till I found somewhat that
promised me the shelter that I sought.
A cluster of cedars appeared, whose
branches over-arched a space that
might be called a bower. It was a slight
cavity, whose flooring was composed of
loose stones and a few faded leaves blown
from a distance, and finding a temporary
lodgement here. On one side was a rock,
forming a wall rugged and projecting
above. At the bottom of the rock was a
rift, some-what resembling a coffin in
shape, and not much larger in
dimensions
.
This rift terminated on the
opposite
side of the rock, in an opening that
was too small for the body of a man to
pass. The distance between each
entrance
was twice the length of a man.
This bower was open to the
South-east
whence the gale now blew. It
therefore
imperfectly afforded the shelter of
which I stood in need; but it was the
best that the place and the time afforded.
To stop the smaller entrance of the cavity
with a stone, and to heap before the other,
branches lopped from the trees with my
hatchet, might somewhat contribute to
my comfort.
This was done, and thrusting myself
into this recess, as far as I was able, I
prepared
for repose. It might have been
reasonably
suspected to be the den of
rattle-snakes or panthers; but my late
contention
with superior dangers and more
formidable enemies made me reckless of
these, but another inconvenience
remained
.
In spite of my precautions, my
motionless posture and slender covering
exposed me so much to the cold that I
could not sleep.
The air appeared to have suddenly
assumed the temperature of mid-winter.
In a short time, my extremeties were
benumbed, and my limbs shivered and
ached as if I had been seized by an
ague. My bed likewise was dank and
uneven, and the posture I was obliged
to assume, unnatural and painful. It
was evident that my purpose could not
be answered by remaining here.
I, therefore, crept forth, and began
to reflect upon the possibility of
continuing
VOL. III B
my journey. Motion was the
only thing that could keep me from
freezing, and my frame was in that state
which allowed me to take no repose in
the absence of warmth; since warmth
were indispensible. It now occurred to
me to ask whether it were not possible
to kindle a fire.
Sticks and leaves were at hand. My
hatchet and a pebble would enable me
to extract a spark. From this, by
suitable
care and perseverance, I might finally
procure sufficient fire to give me comfort
and ease, and even enable me to sleep.
This boon was delicious and I felt as
if I were unable to support a longer
deprivation of it.
I proceeded to execute this scheme. I
took the dryest leaves, and endeavoured
to use them as tinder, but the driest
leaves were moistened by the dews. They
were only to be found in the hollows, in
some of which were pools of water and
others were dank. I was not speedily
discouraged, but my repeated attempts
failed, and I was finally compelled to
relinquish this expedient.
All that now remained was to wander
forth and keep myself in motion till the
morning. The night was likely to prove
tempestuous and long. The gale seemed
freighted with ice, and acted upon my
body like the points of a thousand needles.
There was no remedy, and I mustered
my patience to endure it.
I returned again, to the brow of the
hill. I ranged along it till I reached a
place where the descent was
perpendicular
,
and, in consequence of affording no
sustenance to trees or bushes, was nearly
smooth and bare. There was no road
to be seen, and this circumstance, added
to the sounds which the ripling current
produced, afforded me some knowledge
of my situation.
The ledge, along which the road was
conducted, disappeared near this spot.
The opposite sides of the chasm through
which flowed the river, approached
nearer
to each other, in the form of jutting
promontories. I now stood upon the
verge of that on the northern side. The
water flowed at the foot, but, for the
space of ten or twelve feet from the rock,
was so shallow as to permit the traveller
and his horse to wade through it, and
thus to regain the road which the
receding
precipice had allowed to be continued
on the farther side.
I knew the nature and dimensions of
this ford. I knew that, at a few yards
from the rock, the channel was of great
depth. To leap into it, in this place, was
a less dangerous exploit, than at the spot
where I had formerly been tempted to
leap. There I was unacquainted with
the depth, but here I knew it to be
considerable
.
Still there was some ground
of hesitation and fear. My present
station
was loftier, and how deeply I might
sink into this gulf, how far the fall and
the concussion would bereave me of my
presence of mind, I could not determine.
This hesitation vanished, and placing
my tom-hawk and fusil upon the ground,
I prepared to leap.
This purpose was suspended, in the
moment of its execution, by a faint sound,
heard from the quarter whence I had
come. It was the warning of men, but
had nothing in common with those which
I had been accustomed to hear. It was
not the howling of a wolf or the yelling
of a panther. These had often been
overheard
by night during my last year's
excursion to the lakes. My fears
whispered
VOL. III Y 2
that this was the vociferation of a
savage.
I was unacquainted with the number
of the enemies who had adventured into
this district. Whether those whom I had
encountered at
Deb's hut
were of that
band whom I had met with in the cavern,
was merely a topic of conjecture. There
might be an half-score of troops, equally
numerous, spread over the wilderness,
and the signal I had just heard might
betoken the approach of one of these.
Yet by what means they should gain
this nook, and what prey they expected
to discover, were not easily conceived.
The sounds, somewhat diversified,
nearer and rising from different quarters,
were again heard. My doubts and
apprehensions
were increased. What
expedient
to adopt for my own safety, was a
subject of rapid meditation. Whether
to remain stretched upon the ground or to
rise and go forward. Was it likely the
enemy would coast along the edge of
the steep? Would they ramble hither to
look upon the ample scene which spread
on all sides around the base of this rocky
pinnacle? In that case, how should I
conduct myself! My arms were ready
for use. Could I not elude the necessity
of shedding more blood? Could I not
anticipate their assault by casting myself
without delay into the stream.
The sense of danger demanded more
attention to be paid to external objects
than to the motives by which my future
conduct should be influenced. My post
was on a circular projecture, in some
degree, detached from the body of the
hill, the brow of which continued in a
streight line, uninterrupted by this
projecture
,
which was somewhat higher than
the continued summit of the ridge. This
line ran at the distance of a few paces
from my post. Objects moving along
this line could merely be perceived to
move, in the present obscurity.
My scrutiny was entirely directed to
this quarter. Presently the treading of
many feet was heard, and several figures
were discovered, following each other in
that streight and regular succession which
is peculiar to the Indians. They kept
along the brow of the hill joining the
promontory
.
I distinctly marked seven
figures in succession.
My resolution was formed. Should
any one cast his eye hither, suspect, or
discover an enemy, and rush towards
me, I determined to start upon my feet,
fire on my foe as he advanced, throw my
piece on the ground, and then leap into
the river.
Happily, they passed unobservant
and in silence. I remained, in the same
posture, for several minutes. At length,
just as my alarms began to subside, the
hollows, before heard, arose, and from the
same quarter as before. This convinced
me that my perils were not at an end. This
now appeared to be merely the vanguard,
and would speedily be followed by others,
against whom the same caution was
necessary to be taken.
My eye, anxiously bent the only way
by which any one could approach, now
discerned a figure, which was
indubitably
that of a man armed, none other
appeared in company, but doubtless
others were near. He approached, stood
still, and appeared to gaze stedfastly at
the spot where I lay.
The optics of a
Lennilennapee
I knew
to be far keener than my own. A log
or a couched fawn would never be
mistaken
for a man, nor a man for a couched
fawn or a log. Not only a human being
would be instantly detected, but a
decision
be unerringly made whether it were
friend or foe. That my prostrate body
was the object on which the attention of
this vigilant and stedfast gazer was fixed,
could not be doubted. Yet, since he
continued an inactive gazer, there was
ground for a possibility to stand upon,
that I was not recognized. My fate,
therefore, was still in suspense.
This interval was momentary. I
marked a movement, which my fears
instantly
interpreted to be that of leveling
a gun at my head. This action was
sufficiently
conformable to my prognostics.
Supposing me to be detected, there was
no need for him to change his post. Aim
might too fatally be taken, and his prey
be secured, from the distance at which
he now stood.
These images glanced upon my
thought, and put an end to my suspense.
A single effort placed me on my feet. I
fired with precipitation that precluded
the certainty of hitting my mark, dropped
my piece upon the ground, and leaped
from this tremendous height into the
river, I reached the surface, and sunk in
a moment to the bottom.
Plunging endlong into the water, the
impetus created by my fall from such an
height, would be slowly resisted by this
denser element. Had the depth been
less, its resistance would not perhaps
have hindered me from being mortally
injured against the rocky bottom. Had
the depth been greater, time enough
would not have been allowed me to
regain the surface. Had I fallen on
my side, I should have been bereaved
of life or sensibility by the shock which
my frame would have received. As it
was, my fate was suspended on a thread.
To have lost my presence of mind, to
have forborne to counteract my sinking,
for an instant, after I had reached the
water, would have made all exertions to
regain the air, fruitless. To so fortunate
a concurrence of events, was thy friend
indebted for his safety!
Yet I only emerged from the gulf to
encounter new perils. Scarcely had I
raised my head above the surface, and
inhaled the vital breath, when twenty
shots were aimed at me from the
precipice
above. A shower of bullets fell
upon the water. Some of them did not
fall further than two inches from my
head. I had not been aware of this new
danger, and now that it assailed me
continued
gasping the air, and floundering
at random. The means of eluding it
did not readily occur. My case seemed
desperate and all caution was dismissed.
This state of discomfiting surprise
quickly disappeared. I made myself
acquainted
,
at a glance, with the position of
surrounding objects. I conceived that
the opposite bank of the river would
afford me most security, and thither I
tended with all the expedition in my
power.
Meanwhile, my safety depended on
eluding the bullets that continued
incessantly
to strike the water at an arm's
length from my body. For this end I
plunged beneath the surface, and only
rose to inhale fresh air. Presently the
firing ceased, the flashes that lately
illuminated
the bank disappeared, and a
certain bustle and murmur of confused
voices gave place to solitude and silence.
VOL. III. C
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XXI.
I reached
without difficulty
the opposite bank, but the steep was
inaccessible. I swam along the edge in
hopes of meeting with some projection
or recess where I might, at least, rest my
weary limbs, and if it were necessary to
recross the river, to lay in a stock of
recruited spirits and strength for that
purpose. I trusted that the water would
speedily become shoal, or that the steep
would afford rest to my feet. In both
these hopes I was disappointed.
There is no one to whom I would
yield the superiority in swimming, but
my strength, like that of other human
beings, had its limits. My previous
fatigues had been enormous, and my
clothes, heavy with moisture, greatly
incumbered and retarded my movements.
I had proposed to free myself from this
imprisonment, but I foresaw the
inconveniences
of wandering over this scene
in absolute nakedness, and was willing
therefore, at whatever hazard, to retain
them. I continued to struggle with the
current and to search for the means of
scaling the steeps. My search was
fruitless
,
and I began to meditate the
recrossing
of the river.
Surely my fate has never been
paralleled
!
Where was this series of hardships
and perils to end? No sooner was one
calamity eluded, than I was beset by
another. I had emerged from abhorred
darkness in the heart of the earth, only
to endure the extremities of famine and
encounter the fangs of a wild beast.
From these I was delivered only to be
thrown into the midst of savages, to wage
an endless and hopeless war with adepts
in killing; with appetites that longed to
feast upon my bowels and to quaff my
heart's-blood. From these likewise was I
rescued, but merely to perish in the gulfs
of the river, to welter on unvisited shores
or to be washed far away from curiosity
or pity.
Formerly water was not only my field
of sport but my sofa and my bed. I
could float for hours on the surface,
enjoying
its delicious cool, almost without the
expense of the slightest motion. It was
an element as fitted for repose as for
exercise
,
but now the buoyant spirit seemed
to have flown. My muscles were shrunk,
the air and water were equally congealed,
and my most vehement exertions were
requisite to sustain me on the surface.
At first I had moved along with my
wonted celerity and ease, but quickly my
forces were exhausted. My pantings
and efforts were augmented and I saw
that to cross the river again was
impracticable
.
I must continue, therefore, to
search out some accessible spot in the
bank along which I was swimming.
Each moment diminished my stock
of strength, and it behoved me to make
good my footing before another minute
should escape. I continued to swim, to
survey the bank, and to make ineffectual
attempts to grasp the rock. The shrubs
which grew upon it would not uphold me,
and the fragments which, for a moment,
inspired me with hope, crumbled away
as soon as they were touched.
At length, I noticed a pine, which
was rooted in a crevice near the water.
VOL. III C 2
The trunk, or any part of the root, was
beyond my reach, but I trusted that I
could catch hold of the branch which
hung lowest, and that, when caught, it
would assist me in gaining the trunk,
and thus deliver me from the death which
could not be otherwise averted.
The attempt was arduous. Had it
been made when I first reached the bank,
no difficulty had attended it, but now,
to throw myself some feet above the
surface could scarcely be expected from
one whose utmost efforts seemed to be
demanded to keep him from sinking.
Yet this exploit, arduous as it was, was
attempted and accomplished. Happily
the twigs were strong enough to sustain
my weight till I caught at other branches
and finally placed myself upon the trunk.
This danger was now past, but I
admitted the conviction that others, no
less formidable remained to be
encountered
and that my ultimate destiny was
death. I looked upward. New efforts
might enable me to gain the summit of this
steep, but, perhaps, I should thus be
placed merely in the situation from which
I had just been delivered. It was of
little moment whether the scene of my
imprisonment was a dungeon not to be
broken, or a summit from which descent
was impossible.
The river, indeed, severed me from
a road which was level and safe, but my
recent dangers were remembered only to
make me shudder at the thought of
incurring
them a second time, by
attempting
to cross it. I blush at the recollection
of this cowardice. It was little akin to
the spirit which I had recently
displayed
.
It was, indeed, an alien to my
bosom, and was quickly supplanted by
intrepidity and perseverance.
I proceeded to mount the hill. From
root to root, and from branch to branch,
lay my journey. It was finished, and I
sat down upon the highest brow to
meditate
on future trials. No road lay
along this side of the river. It was
rugged and sterile, and farms were
sparingly
dispersed over it. To reach one of
these was now the object of my wishes.
I had not lost the desire of reaching
Solebury before morning, but my wet
clothes and the coldness of the night
seemed to have bereaved me of the
power
.
I traversed this summit, keeping the
river on my right hand. Happily, its
declinations and ascents were by no
means difficult, and I was cheered in
the midst of my vexations, by observing
that every mile brought me nearer to my
uncle's dwelling. Meanwhile I anxiously
looked for some tokens of an habitation.
These at length presented themselves.
A wild heath, whistled over by October
blasts, meagrely adorned with the dry
stalks of scented shrubs and the bald
heads of the sapless mullen, was
succeeded
by a fenced field and a corn-stack.
The dwelling to which these belonged
was eagerly sought.
I was not surprised that all voices
were still and all lights extinguished, for
this was the hour of repose. Having
reached a piazza before the house, I
paused. Whether, at this drousy time,
to knock for admission, to alarm the
peaceful tenants and take from them the
rest which their daily toils and their
rural innocence had made so sweet, or
to retire to what shelter an hay-stack or
barn could afford, was the theme of my
deliberations.
Meanwhile I looked up at the house.
It was the model of cleanliness and
comfort
.
It was built of wood; but the
materials had undergone the plane, as
well as the axe and the saw. It was
painted white, and the windows not only
had sashes, but these sashes were
supplied, contrary to custom, with glass.
In most cases, the aperture where glass
should be is stuffed with an old hat or a
petticoat. The door had not only all its
parts entire, but was embellished with
mouldings and a pediment. I gathered
from these tokens that this was the abode
not only of rural competence and
innocence
,
but of some beings, raised by
education and fortune, above the
intellectual
mediocrity of clowns.
Methought I could claim
consanguinity
with such beings. Not to share
their charity and kindness would be
inflicting as well as receiving injury.
The trouble of affording shelter, and
warmth, and wholesome diet to a wretch
destitute as I was, would be eagerly
sought by them.
Still I was unwilling to disturb them.
I bethought myself that their kitchen
might be entered, and all that my
necessities
required be obtained without
interrupting
their slumber. I needed nothing
but the warmth which their kitchen
hearth would afford. Stretched upon
the bricks, I might dry my clothes, and
perhaps enjoy some unmolested sleep.
In spite of presages of ill and the
horrid
remembrances of what I had
performed
and endured. I believed that
nature would afford a short respite to my
cares.
I went to the door of what appeared
to be a kitchen. The door was wide
open. This circumstance portended evil.
Though it be not customary to lock or
to bolt, it is still less usual to have
entrances
unclosed. I entered with suspicious
steps, and saw enough to confirm my
apprehensions. Several pieces of wood
half burned, lay in the midst of the floor.
They appeared to have been removed
hither from the chimney, doubtless with
a view to set fire to the whole building.
The fire had made some progress on
the floor, but had been seasonably
extinguished
by pail's-full of water, thrown
upon it. The floor was still deluged
with wet, the pail not emptied of all its
contents stood upon the hearth. The
earthen vessels and plates whose proper
place was the dresser, were scattered in
fragments in all parts of the room. I
looked around me for some one to explain
this scene, but no one appeared.
The last spark of fire was put out,
so that had my curiosity been idle, my
purpose could not be accomplished.
To retire from this scene, neither
curiosity
nor benevolence would permit. That
some mortal injury had been intended
was apparent. What greater mischief had
befallen, or whether greater might not,
by my interposition, be averted, could
only be ascertained by penetrating
further
into the house. I opened a door
on one side which led to the main body
of the building and entered to a
bed-chamber
.
I stood at the entrance and
knocked, but no one answered my
signals
The sky was not totally clouded, so
that some light pervaded the room. I
saw that a bed stood in the corner, but
whether occupied or not, its curtains
hindered me from judging. I stood in
suspense a few minutes, when a motion
in the bed shewed me that some one was
there. I knocked again but withdrew to
the outside of the door. This roused
the sleeper, who, half-groaning and
puffing the air through his nostrils,
VOL. III D
grumbled out in the hoarsest voice that
I ever heard, and in a tone of surly
impatience
...
Who is there?
I hesitated for an answer, but the
voice instantly continued in the manner
of one half-asleep and enraged at being
disturbed... Is't you Peg? Damn ye, stay
away, now; I tell ye stay away, or, by
God I will cut your throat... I will... He
continued to mutter and swear, but
without
coherence or distinctness.
These were the accents of
drunkenness
,
and denoted a wild and ruffian life.
They were little in unison with the
external appearances of the mansion, and
blasted all the hopes I had formed of
mecting under this roof with gentleness
and hospitality. To talk with this being,
to attempt to reason him into humanity
and soberness, was useless. I was at a
loss in what manner to address him, or
whether it was proper to maintain any
parley. Meanwhile, my silence was
supplied by the suggestions of his own
distempered fancy. Ay, said he, ye
will, will ye? well come on, let's see who's
the better at the oak-stick. If I part
with ye, before I have bared your bones
... I'll teach ye to be always dipping in
my dish, ye devil's dam! ye!
So saying, he tumbled out of bed.
At the first step, he struck his head
against the bed-post, but setting himself
upright, he staggered towards the spot
where I stood. Some new obstacle
occurred
.
He stumbled and fell at his
length upon the floor.
To encounter or expostulate with a
man in this state was plainly absurd. I
turned and issued forth, with an aching
heart, into the court before the house.
The miseries which a debauched
husband
or father inflicts upon all whom
their evil destiny allies to him were
pictured by my fancy, and wrung from
me tears of anguish. These images,
however, quickly yielded to reflections on
my own state. No expedient now
remained
,
but to seek the barn, and find a
covering
and a bed of straw.
I had scarcely set foot within the
barn-yard when I heard a sound as o
the crying of an infant. It appeared to
issue from the barn. I approached softly
and listened at the door. The cries of
the babe continued, but were
accompanied
by intreaties of a nurse or a mother
to be quiet. These intreaties were
mingled with heart-breaking sobs and
exclamations of... Ah! me, my babe!
Canst thou not sleep and afford thy
unhappy mother some peace? Thou art
cold, and I have not sufficient warmth
to cherish thee! What will become of us?
Thy deluded father cares not if we both
perish.
A glimpse of the true nature of the
scene seemed to be imparted by these
words. I now likewise recollected
incidents
that afforded additional light.
Somewhere
on this bank of the river, there
formerly resided one by name Selby.
He was an aged person, who united science
and taste to the simple and laborious
habits of an husbandman. He had a son
who resided several years in Europe,
but on the death of his father, returned
home, accompanied by a wife. He had
succeeded to the occupation of the farm,
but rumour had whispered many tales to
the disadvantage of his morals. His
wife was affirmed to be of delicate and
polished manners, and much unlike her
companion.
It now occured to me that this was the
dwelling of the Selby's, and I seemed to
VOL. III D 2
have gained some insight into the discord
and domestic miseries by which the
unhappy
lady suffered. This was no time
to waste my sympathy on others. I could
benefit her nothing. Selby had probably
returned from a carousal, with all his
malignant passions raised into phrensy
by intoxication. He had driven his
desolate
wife from her bed and house, and to
shun outrage and violence she had fled,
with her helpless infant, to the barn.
To appease his fury, to console her, to
suggest a remedy for this distress, was
not in my power. To have sought an
interview would be merely to excite her
terrors and alarm her delicacy, without
contributing to alleviate her calamity.
Here then was no asylum for me. A
place of rest must be sought at some
neighbouring habitation. It was
probable
that one would be found at no great
distance, the path that led from the spot
where I stood, through a gate into a
meadow, might conduct me to the nearest
dwelling, and this path I immediately
resolved
to explore.
I was anxious to open the gate
without noise, but I could not succeed.
Some creaking of its hinges, was
unavoidably
produced, which I feared would be
overheard by the lady and multiply her
apprehensions and perplexities. This
inconvenience was irremediable. I
therefore closed the gate and pursued
the foot way before me with the utmost
expedition. I had not gained the further
end of the meadow when I lighted on
something which lay across the path,
and which, on being closely, inspected,
appeared to be an human body. It was
the corse of a girl, mangled by an hatchet.
Her head gory and deprived of its looks,
easily explained the kind of enemies by
whom she had been assailed. Here was
proof that this quiet and remote
habitation
had been visited, in their destructive
progress by the Indians. The girl had
been slain by them, and her scalp,
according
to their savage custom, had been
torn away to be preserved as a trophy.
The fire which had been kindled on
the kitchen floor was now remembered,
and corroborated the inferences which
were drawn from this spectacle. And
yet that the mischief had been thus
limited, that the besotted wretch who lay
helpless on his bed, and careless of
impending danger, and that the mother
and her infant should escape, excited
some degree of surprise. Could the
savages have been interrupted in their
work, and obliged to leave their vengeance
unfinished?
Their visit had been recent. Many
hours had not elapsed since they prowled
about these grounds. Had they wholly
disappeared and meant they not to
return? To what new danger might I
be exposed in remaining thus guideless
and destitute of all defence?
In consequence of these reflections,
I proceeded with more caution. I looked
with suspicious glances, before and on
either side of me. I now approached
the fence which, on this side, bounded
the meadow. Something was discerned
or immagined, stretched close to the
fence, on the ground, and filling up the
path-way. My apprehensions of a
lurking enemy, had been previously
awakened, and my fancy instantly figured
to itself an armed man, lying on the
ground and waiting to assail the
unsuspecting
passenger.
At first I was prompted to fly, but a
second thought shewed me that I had
already approached near enough to be
endangered. Notwithstanding my pause,
the form was motionless. The possibility
of being misled in my conjectures was
easily supposed. What I saw might be a
log or it might be another victim to savage
ferocity. This tract was that which my
safety required me to pursue. To turn
aside or go back would be merely to
bewilder myself anew.
Urged by these motives, I went
nearer, and at least was close enough to
perceive that the figure was human.
He lay upon his face, near his right hand
was a musquet, unclenched. This
circumstance
,
his death-like attitude and
the garb and ornaments of an Indian,
made me readily suspect the nature and
cause of this catastrophe. Here the
invaders had been encountered and
repulsed, and one at least of their
number
had been left upon the field.
I was weary of contemplating these
rueful objects. Custom, likewise, even
in so short a period, had innured me to
spectacles of horror. I was grown callous
and immoveable. I staid not to ponder
on the scene, but snatching the musquet,
which was now without an owner, and
which might be indispensable to my
defence
,
I hastened into the wood. On
this side the meadow was skirted by a
forest, but a beaten road lead into it,
and might therefore be attempted
without
danger.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XXII.
The
road was intricate and long.
It seemed designed to pervade the forest
in every possible direction. I frequently
noticed cut wood, piled in heaps upon
either side, and rejoiced in these tokens
that the residence of men was near. At
length I reached a second fence, which
proved to be the boundary of a road still
more frequented. I pursued this, and
presently
beheld, before me, the river and
its opposite barriers.
This object afforded me some
knowledge
of my situation. There was a
ford over which travellers used to pass,
and in which the road that I was now
pursuing terminated. The stream was
rapid and tumultuous, but in this place
it did not rise higher than the shoulders.
On the opposite side was an highway,
passable by horses and men, though not
carriages, and which led into the midst of
Solebury. Should I not rush into the
stream, and still aim at reaching my
uncle's house before morning? Why
should I delay?
Thirty hours of incessant
watchfulness
and toil, of enormous efforts and
perils, preceded and accompanied by
abstinence and wounds, were enough to
annihilate the strength and courage of
ordinary men. In the course of them, I had
frequently believed myself to have
reached
the verge beyond which my force
would not carry me, but experience as
frequently demonstrated my error.
Though many miles, were yet to be
VOL. III. E
traversed, though my clothes were once
more to be drenched and loaded with
moisture, though every hour seemed to
add somewhat to the keenness of the
blast: yet how should I know, but by trial,
whether my stock of energy was not
sufficient
for this last exploit?
My resolution to proceed was nearly
formed, when the figure of a man moving
slowly across the road, at some distance
before me, was observed. Hard by this
ford lived a man by name Bisset, of
whom I had slight knowledge. He
tended his two hundred acres with a
plodding and money-doating spirit, while
his son overlooked a Grist-mill, on the
river. He was a creature of gain, coarse
and harmless. The man whom I saw
before
me might be he, or some one
belonging
to his family. Being armed for defence,
I less scrupled a meeting with any thing
in the shape of man. I therefore called.
The figure stopped and answered me,
without surliness or anger. The voice
was unlike that of Bisset, but this
person's
information I believed would be of
some service.
Coming up to him, he proved to be
a clown, belonging to Bisset's habitation.
His panic and surprise on seeing me
made him aghast. In my present garb
I should not have easily been recognized
by my nearest kinsman, and much less
easily by one who had seldom met me.
It may be easily conceived that my
thoughts, when allowed to wander from
the objects before me, were tormented
with forebodings and inquietudes on
account
of the ills which I had so much
reason to believe had befallen my family.
I had no doubt that some evil had
happened
,
but the full extent of it was still
uncertain. I desired and dreaded to
discover the truth, and was unable to
interrogate this person in a direct
manner
.
I could deal only in circuities and
hints. I shuddered while I waited for
an answer to my inquiries.
Had not Indians, I asked, been lately
seen in this neighbourhood? Were they
not suspected of hostile designs? Had
they not already committed some
mischief
?
Some passenger, perhaps, had
been attacked; or fire had been set to
some house? On which side of the river
had their steps been observed, or any
devastation been committed? Above the
ford or below it? At what distance from
the river?
When his attention could be
withdrawn
from my person and bestowed
upon my questions, he answered that
some alarm had indeed been spread
about Indians, and that parties from
Solebury and
Chetasko
were out in
pursuit
of them, that many persons had been
killed by them, and that one house in
Solebury had been rifled and burnt on
the night before the last.
These tidings were a dreadful
confirmation
of my fears. There scarcely
remained a doubt: but still my expiring
hope prompted me to inquire to whom
did the house belong?
He answered that he had not heard
the name of the owner. He was a
stranger
to the people on the other side of
the river.
Were any of the inhabitants
murdered
?
Yes. All that were at home except
a girl whom they carried off. Some said
that the girl had been retaken?
What was the name? Was it Huntly?
Huntly? yes. No. He did not know.
He had forgotten.
VOL. III. E 2
I fixed my eyes upon the ground. An
interval of gloomy meditation succeeded.
All was lost, all for whose sake I desired
to live, had perished by the hands of
these assassins. That dear home, the
scene of my sportive childhood, of my
studies, labours and recreations, was
ravaged by fire and the sword: was
reduced to a frightful ruin.
Not only all that embellished and
endeared existence was destroyed, but
the means of subsistence itself. Thou
knowest that my sisters and I were
dependants on the bounty of our uncle.
His death would make way for the
succession
of his son, a man fraught with
envy and malignity: who always testified
a mortal hatred to us, merely because we
enjoyed the protection of his father.
The ground which furnished me with
bread was now become the property of
one, who, if he could have done it with
security, would gladly have mingled
poison with my food.
All that my imagination or my heart
regarded as of value had likewise
perished
.
Whatever my chamber, my closets,
my cabinets contained, my furniture, my
books, the records of my own skill, the
monuments of their existence whom I
loved, my very cloathing, were involved
in indiscriminate and irretreivable
destruction
.
Why should I survive this
calamity?
But did not he say that one had
escaped? The only females in the family
were my sisters. One of these had been
reserved for a fate worse than death; to
gratify the innate and insatiable cruelty
of savages by suffering all the torments
their invention can suggest, or to linger
out years of dreary bondage and
unintermitted
hardship in the bosom of the
wilderness. To restore her to liberty;
to cherish this last survivor of my
unfortunate
race was a sufficient motive to
life and to activity.
But soft! Had not rumour whispered
that the captive was retaken? Oh! who
was her angel of deliverance? Where
did she now abide? Weeping over the
untimely fall of her protector and her
friend. Lamenting and upbraiding the
absence of her brother? Why should I
not haste to find her? To mingle my
tears with hers, to assure her of my
safety and expiate the involuntary
crime of my desertion, by devoting all
futurity to the task of her consolation
and improvement?
The path was open and direct. My
new motives, would have trampled upon
every impediment and made me reckless
of all dangers and all toils. I broke
from my reverie, and without taking
leave or expressing gratitude to my
informant
,
I ran with frantic expedition
towards
the river, and plunging into it
gained the opposite side in a moment.
I was sufficiently acquainted with
the road. Some twelve or fifteen miles
remained to be traversed. I did not fear
that my strength would fail in the
performance
of my journey. It was not my
uncle's habitation to which I directed
my steps. Inglefield was my friend. If
my sister had existence, or was snatched
from captivity, it was here that an asylum
had been afforded to her, and here was
I to seek the knowledge of my destiny.
For this reason having reached a spot
where the road divided into two
branches
,
one of which led to Inglefield's and
the other to Huntly's, I struck into the
former.
Scarcely had I passed the angle
when I noticed a building, on the right
hand, at some distance from the road.
In the present state of my thoughts, it
would not have attracted my attention,
had not a light gleamed from an upper
window, and told me that all within
were not at rest.
I was acquainted with the owner of
this mansion. He merited esteem and
confidence, and could not fail to be
acquainted
with recent events. From him
I should obtain all the information that
I needed, and I should be delivered from
some part of the agonies of my suspense.
I should reach his door in a few minutes,
and the window-light was a proof that
my entrance at this hour would not
disturb
the family, some of whom were
stirring.
Through a gate, I entered an avenue
of tall oaks, that led to the house. I
could not but reflect on the effect which
my appearance would produce upon the
family. The sleek locks, neat apparel,
pacific guise, sobriety and gentleness of
aspect by which I was customarily
distinguished
,
would in vain be sought in
the apparition which would now present
itself before them. My legs, neck and
bosom were bare, and their native hue
were exchanged for the livid marks of
bruises and scarrifications. An horrid
scar upon my cheek, and my uncombed
locks; hollow eyes, made ghastly by
abstinence
and cold, and the ruthless
passions
of which my mind had been the
theatre, added to the musquet which I
carried in my hand, would prepossess
them with the notion of a maniac or
ruffian.
Some inconveniences might hence
arise, which however could not be
avoided
.
I must trust to the speed with
which my voice and my words should
disclose my true character and rectify
their mistake.
I now reached the principal door of
the house. It was open, and I
unceremoniously
entered. In the midst of the
room stood a German stove, well heated.
To thaw my half frozen limbs was my
first care. Meanwhile, I gazed around
me, and marked the appearances of
things.
Two lighted candles stood upon the
table. Beside them were cyder-bottles
and pipes of tobacco. The furniture
and room was in that state which
denoted
it to have been lately filled with
drinkers and smokers, yet neither voice,
nor visage, nor motion were any where
observable. I listened but neither above
nor below, within or without, could any
tokens of an human being be perceived.
This vacancy and silence must have
been lately preceded by noise and
concourse
and bustle. The contrast was
mysterious and ambiguous. No
adequate
cause of so quick and absolute a
transition occured to me. Having gained
some warmth and lingered some ten or
twenty minutes in this uncertainty, I
determined to explore the other
apartments
of the building. I knew not
what might betide in my absence, or
what I might encounter in my search
to justify precaution, and, therefore, kept
the gun in my hand. I snatched a
candle
from the table and proceeded into
two other apartments on the first floor
and the kitchen. Neither was inhabited,
though chairs and tables were arranged
in their usual order, and no traces of
violence or hurry were apparent.
Having gained the foot of the
staircase
,
I knocked, but my knocking was
wholly disregarded. A light had
appeared
in an upper chamber. It was
VOL. III F
not, indeed, in one of those apartments
which the family permanently occupied,
but in that which, according to rural
custom, was reserved for guests; but it
indubitably betokened the presence of
some being by whom my doubts might
be solved. These doubts were too
tormenting
to allow of scruples and delay.
I mounted the stairs.
At each chamber door I knocked, but
I knocked in vain. I tried to open, but
found them to be locked. I at length
reached the entrance of that in which a
light had been discovered. Here, it was
certain, that some one would be found;
but here, as well as elsewhere, my
knocking
was unnoticed.
To enter this chamber was audacious,
but no other expedient was afforded me
to determine whether the house had any
inhabitants. I, therefore, entered, though
with caution and reluctance. No one
was within, but there were sufficient
traces of some person who had lately
been here. On the table stood a
travelling
escrutoire, open, with pens and
ink-stand
.
A chair was placed before it,
and a candle on the right hand. This
apparatus was rarely seen in this country.
Some traveller it seemed occupied this
room, though the rest of the mansion
was deserted. The pilgrim, as these
appearances
testified, was of no vulgar
order, and belonged not to the class of
periodical and every-day guests.
It now occurred to me that the
occupant
of this appartment could not be far
off, and that some danger and
embarrassment
could not fail to accrue from being
found, thus accoutred and garbed, in a
place sacred to the study and repose of
another. It was proper, therefore, to
withdraw, and either to resume my
journey
,
or wait for the stranger's return,
whom perhaps some temporary
engagement
had called away, in the lower and
public room. The former now appeared
to be the best expedient, as the return
of this unknown person was uncertain,
as well as his power to communicate the
information which I wanted.
Had paper, as well as the implements
of writing, lain upon the desk, perhaps
my lawless curiosity would not have
scrupled
to have pryed into it. On the first
glance nothing of that kind appeared,
but now, as I turned towards the door,
somewhat, lying beside the desk, on the
side opposite the candle, caught my
attention
.
The impulse was instantaneous
and mechanical, that made me leap to
the spot, and lay my hand upon it. Till
I felt it between my fingers, till I brought
it near my eyes and read frequently the
inscriptions that appeared upon it, I was
doubtful whether my senses had deceived
me.
Few, perhaps, among mankind have
undergone vicissitudes of peril and
wonder
equal to mine. The miracles of
poetry, the transitions of enchantment,
are beggarly and mean compared with
those which I had experienced: Passage
into new forms, overleaping the bars of
time and space, reversal of the laws of
inanimate and intelligent existence had
been mine to perform and to witness.
No event had been more fertile of
sorrow and perplexity than the loss of
thy brother's letters. They went by
means invisible, and disappeared at a
moment
when foresight would have least
predicted their disappearance. They
now placed themselves before me, in a
manner equally abrupt, in a place and
by means, no less contrary to
expectation
.
The papers which I now seized
F 2
were those letters. The parchment
cover
,
the string that tied, and the wax
that sealed them, appeared not to have
been opened or violated.
The power that removed them from
my cabinet, and dropped them in this
house, a house which I rarely visited,
which I had not entered during the last
year, with whose inhabitants I
maintained
no cordial intercourse, and to
whom my occupations and amusements,
my joys and my sorrows, were unknown,
was no object even of conjecture. But
they were not possessed by any of the
family. Some stranger was here, by
whom they had been stolen, or into
whose possession, they had, by some
incomprehensible chance, fallen.
That stranger was near. He had
left this apartment for a moment. He
would speedily return. To go hence,
might possibly occasion me to miss him.
Here then I would wait, till he should
grant me an interview. The papers
were mine, and were recovered. I would
never part with them. But to know by
whose force or by whose stratagems I
had been bereaved of them thus long,
was now the supreme passion of my soul,
I seated myself near a table and anxiously
awaited for an interview, on which I
was irresistably persuaded to believe
that much of my happiness depended.
Meanwhile, I could not but connect
this incident with the destruction of my
family. The loss of these papers had
excited transports of grief, and yet, to
have lost them thus, was perhaps the
sole expedient, by which their final
preservation
could be rendered possible.
Had they remained in my cabinet, they
could not have escaped the destiny which
overtook the house and its furniture.
Savages are not accustomed to leave
their exterminating work unfinished.
The house which they have plundered,
they are careful to level with the ground.
This not only their revenge, but their
caution prescribes. Fire may originate
by accident as well as by design, and
the traces of pillage and murder are
totally obliterated by the flames.
These thoughts were interrupted by
the shutting of a door below, and by
foot-steps ascending the stairs. My heart
throbbed at the sound. My seat became
uneasy and I started on my feet. I even
advanced half way to the entrance of
the room. My eyes were intensely fixed
upon the door. My impatience would
have made me guess at the person of this
visitant by measuring his shadow, if his
shadow were first seen; but this was
precluded by the position of the light.
It was only when the figure entered, and
the whole person was seen, that my
curiosity
was gratified. He who stood before
me was the parent and fosterer of my
mind, the companion and instructor of
my youth, from whom I had been parted
for years; from whom I believed myself
to be forever separated;
Sarsefield
himself
!
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XXIII.
My
deportment, at an interview
so much desired and so wholly
unforeseen
,
was that of a maniac. The
petrifying
influence of surprise, yielded to the
impetuosities of passion. I held him in
my arms: I wept upon his bosom, I
sobbed
with emotion which, had it not found
passage at my eyes, would have burst
my heart-strings. Thus I who had
escaped the deaths that had previously
assailed me in so many forms, should
have been reserved to solemnize a scene
like this by...
dying for joy!
The sterner passions and habitual
austerities of my companion, exempted
him from pouring out this testimony of
his feelings. His feelings were indeed
more allied to astonishment and
incredulity
than mine had been. My person
was not instantly recognized. He shrunk
from my embrace, as if I were an
apparition
or impostor. He quickly
disengaged
himself from my arms, and
withdrawing
a few paces, gazed upon me as on
one whom he had never before seen.
These repulses were ascribed to the
loss of his affection. I was not mindful
of the hideous guise in which I stood
before him, and by which he might
justly
be misled to imagine me a ruffian or a
lunatic. My tears flowed now on a new
account, and I articulated in a broken
and faint voiceMy master! my friend!
Have you forgotten! have you ceased to
love me?
The sound of my voice made him
start and exclaimAm I alive? am I
awake? Speak again I beseech you, and
convince me that I am not dreaming or
delirious.
Can you need any proof, I answered,
that it is Edgar Huntly, your pupil, your
child that speaks to you?
He now withdrew his eyes from me
and fixed them on the floor. After a
pause he resumed, in emphatic accents.
Well, I have lived to this age in
unbelief
.
To credit or trust in miraculous
agency was foreign to my nature, but
now I am no longer sceptical. Call me
to any bar, and exact from me an oath
that you have twice been dead and twice
recalled to life; that you move about
invisibly, and change your place by the
force, not of muscles, but of thought,
and I will give it.
How came you hither? Did you
penetrate the wall? Did you rise through
the floor?
Yet surely 'tis an error. You could
not be he whom twenty witnesses
affirmed
to have beheld a lifeless and mangled
corpse upon the ground, whom my own
eyes saw in that condition.
In seeking the spot once more to
provide
you a grave, you had vanished.
Again I met you. You plunged into a
rapid stream, from an height from which
it was impossible to fall and to live: yet,
as if to set the limits of nature at defiance;
to sport with human penetration, you rose
upon the surface: You floated; you
swam: Thirty bullets were aimed at
your head, by marks-men celebrated for
the exactness of their sight. I myself
was of the number, and I never missed
what I desired to hit.
VOL. III. G
My predictions were confirmed by
the event. You ceased to struggle; you
sunk to rise no more, and yet after these
accumulated deaths, you light upon this
floor: so far distant from the scene of
your catastrophe; over spaces only to be
passed, in so short a time as has since
elapsed, by those who have wings.
My eyes, my ears bear testimony to
your existence now, as they formerly
convinced me of your deathWhat am
I to think; What proofs am I to credit?
There he stopped.
Every accent of this speech added
to the confusion of my thoughts. The
allusions that my friend had made were
not unintelligible. I gained a glimpse
of the complicated errors by which we
had been mutually deceived. I had fainted
on the area before Deb's hut. I was found
by Sarsefield in this condition, and
imagined
to be dead.
The man whom I had seen upon the
promontory was not an Indian. He
belonged
to a numerous band of pursuers,
whom my hostile and precipitate
deportment
caused to suspect me for an enemy.
They that fired from the steep were
friends. The interposition that screened
me from so many bullets, was indeed
miraculous. No wonder that my
voluntary
sinking, in order to elude their shots,
was mistaken for death, and that, having
accomplished the destruction of this foe,
they resumed their pursuit of others.
But how was Sarsefield apprized that it
was I who plunged into the river? No
subsequent event was possible to impart
to him the incredible truth.
A pause of mutual silence ensued.
At length, Sarsefield renewed his
expressions
of amazement at this interview, and
besought me to explain why I had
disappeared
by night from my Uncle's house,
and by what series of unheard of events
this interview was brought about. Was
it indeed Huntly whom he examined and
mourned over at the threshold of Deb's
hut? Whom he had sought in every
thicket and cave in the ample circuit of
Norwalk and Chetasco? Whom he had
seen perish in the current of the
Delaware
?
Instead of noticing his questions, my
soul was harrowed with anxiety
respecting
the fate of my uncle and sisters.
Sarsefield could communicate the tidings
which would decide on my future lot, and
set my portion in happiness or misery.
Yet I had not breath to speak my
inquiries
.
Hope tottered, and I felt as if a
single word would be sufficient for its
utter subversion. At length, I
articulated
the name of my Uncle.
The single word sufficiently imparted
my fears, and these fears needed no
verbal
confirmation. At that dear name,
my companion's features were overspread
by sorrowYour Uncle, said he, is dead.
Dead? Merciful Heaven! And my
sisters too! Both?
Your Sisters are alive and well.
Nay, resumed I, in faultering accents,
jest not with my feelings. Be not cruel
in your pity. Tell me the truth.
I have said the truth. They are well,
at Mr. Inglefield's.
My wishes were eager to assent to
the truth of these tidings. The better
part of me was then safe: but how did
they escape the fate that overtook my
uncle? How did they evade the
destroying
hatchet and the midnight
conflagration
?
These doubts were imparted in a
tumultuous and obscure manner to my
friend. He no sooner fully
comprehended
them, than he looked at me, with
some inquietude and surprise.
Huntly, said he, are you madWhat
has filled you with these hideous
prepossessions
?
Much havoc has indeed
been committed in Chetasco and the
wilderness
;
and a log hut has been burnt
by design or by accident in Solebury,
but that is all. Your house has not been
assailed by either fire-brand or tom-hawk.
Every thing is safe and in its ancient
order. The master indeed is gone, but
the old man fell a victim to his own
temerity
and hardihood. It is thirty years
since he retired with three wounds, from
the field of Braddock; but time, in no
degree, abated his adventurous and
military
spirit. On the first alarm, he
summoned
his neighbours, and led them in
pursuit of the invaders. Alas! he was
the first to attack them, and the only one
who fell in the contest.
G
These words were uttered in a
manner
that left me no room to doubt of their
truth. My uncle had already been
lamented
,
and the discovery of the nature
of his death, so contrary to my
forebodings
,
and of the safety of my girls,
made the state of my mind partake more
of exultation and joy, than of grief or
regret.
But how was I deceived? Had not
my fusil been found in the hands of an
enemy? Whence could he have
plundered
it but from my own chamber? It hung
against the wall of a closet; from which
no stranger could have taken it except by
violence. My perplexities and doubts
were not at an end, but those which
constituted
my chief torment were removed.
I listened to my friend's intreaties to tell
him the cause of my elopement, and the
incidents that terminated in the present
interview.
I began with relating my return to
consciousness in the bottom of the pit; my
efforts to free myself from this abhorred
prison; the acts of horror to which I was
impelled by famine, and their
excruciating
consequences; my gaining the outlet
of the cavern, the desperate expedient by
which I removed the impediment to my
escape, and the deliverance of the
captive
girl; the contest I maintained before
Deb's hut; my subsequent wanderings;
the banquet which hospitality afforded
me; my journey to the river-bank; my
meditations on the means of reaching the
road; my motives for hazarding my life,
by plunging into the stream; and my
subsequent
perils and fears till I reached
the threshold of this habitation.
Thus, continued I, I have complied
with your request. I have told all that
I, myself, know. What were the
incidents
between my sinking to rest at
Inglefield's, and my awaking in the
chambers
of the hill; by which means and by
whose contrivance, preternatural or
human
,
this transition was effected, I am
unable to explain; I cannot even guess.
What has eluded my sagacity may not
be beyond the reach of another. Your
own reflections on my tale, or some facts
that have fallen under your notice, may
enable you to furnish a solution. But,
meanwhile, how am I to account for your
appearance on this spot? This meeting
was unexpected and abrupt to you, but it
has not been less so to me. Of all
mankind
,
Sarsefield was the farthest from my
thoughts, when I saw these tokens of a
traveller and a stranger.
You were imperfectly acquainted with
my wanderings. You saw me on the
ground before Deb's hut. You saw me
plunge into the river. You endeavoured
to destroy me while swimming; and you
knew, before my narrative was heard,
that Huntly was the object of your
enmity
.
What was the motive of your
search in the desert, and how were you
apprized of my condition? These things
are not less wonderful than any of those
which I have already related.
During my tale the features of
Sarsefield
betokened the deepest attention.
His eye strayed not a moment from my
face. All my perils and forebodings,
were fresh in my remembrance, they
had scarcely gone by; their skirts, so to
speak, were still visible. No wonder
that my eloquence was vivid and pathetic,
that I pourtrayed the past as if it were
the present scene; and that not my tongue
only, but every muscle and limb, spoke.
When I had finished my relation.
Sarsefield sunk into thoughtfulness.
From this, after a time, he recovered
and said: Your tale, Huntly; is true, yet,
did I not see you before me, were I not
acquainted with the artlessness and
rectitude
of your character, and, above all,
had not my own experience, during the
last three days, confirmed every
incident
,
I should question its truth. You
have amply gratified my curiosity, and
deserve that your own, should be
gratified
as fully. Listen to me.
Much has happened since we parted,
which shall not be now mentioned. I
promised to inform you of my welfare by
letter, and did not fail to write, but
whether my letters were received, or
any were written by you in return, or if
written were ever transmitted, I cannot
tell; none were ever received.
Some days since, I arrived, in
company
with a lady who is my wife, in
America
.
You have never been forgotten
by me. I knew your situation to be
little in agreement with your wishes,
and one of the benefits which fortune
has lately conferred upon me, is the
power of snatching you from a life of
labour and obscurity; whose goods,
scanty as they are, were transient and
precarious; and affording you the
suitable
leisure and means of intellectual
gratification and improvement.
Your silence made me entertain some
doubts concerning your welfare, and
even your existence. To solve these
doubts, I hastened to Solebury, some
delays upon the road, hindered me from
accomplishing my journey by day-light.
It was night before I entered the
Norwalk
path, but my ancient rambles with
you made me familiar with it, and I was
not affraid of being obstructed or
bewildered
.
Just as I gained the southern outlet,
I spied a passenger on foot, coming
towards me with a quick pace. The
incident was of no moment, and yet the
time of night, the seeming expedition of
the walker, recollection of the mazes and
obstacles which he was going to
encounter
,
and a vague conjecture that, perhaps,
he was unacquainted with the difficulties
that awaited him, made me eye him with
attention as he passed.
He came near, and I thought I
recognized
a friend in this traveller. The form,
the gesture, the stature bore a powerful
resemblance to those of Edgar Huntly.
This resemblance was so strong, that I
stopped, and after he had gone by, called
him by your name. That no notice was
taken of my call proved that the person
was mistaken, but even though it were
another, that he should not even hesitate
or turn at a summons which he could not
VOL. III H
but perceive to be addressed, though
erroneously, to him, was the source of
some surprize. I did not repeat my call,
but proceeded on my way.
All had retired to repose in your
uncle's dwelling. I did not scruple to
rouse them, and was received with
affectionate
and joyous greetings. That you
allowed your uncle to rise before you,
was a new topic of reflection. To my
inquiries concerning you, answers were
made that accorded with my wishes. I
was told that you were in good health
and were then abed. That you had not
heard and risen at my knocking, was
mentioned with surprise, but your uncle
accounted for your indolence by saying
that during the last week you had
fatigued
yourself by rambling night and day,
in search of some maniac, or visionary
who was supposed to have retreated into
Norwalk.
I insisted upon awakening you myself.
I anticipated the effect of this sudden and
unlooked for meeting, with some
emotions
of pride as well as of pleasure. To
find, in opening your eyes, your old
preceptor
standing by your bed-side and
gazing in your face, would place you, I
conceived, in an affecting situation.
Your chamber door was open, but
your bed was empty. Your uncle and
sisters were made acquainted with this
circumstance. Their surprise gave way
to conjectures that your restless and
romantic spirit, had tempted you from
your repose, that you had rambled abroad
on some phantastic errand, and would
probably return before the dawn. I
willingly
acquiesced in this opinion, and
my feelings being too thoroughly aroused
to allow me to sleep, I took possession
of your chamber, and patiently awaited
your return.
The morning returned but Huntly
made not his appearance. Your uncle
became somewhat uneasy at this
unseasonable
absence. Much speculation and
inquiry, as to the possible reasons of
your flight was made. In my survey of
your chamber, I noted that only part of
your cloathing remained beside your
bed. Coat, hat, stockings and shoes lay
upon the spot where they had probably
been thrown when you had disrobed
yourself, but the pantaloons, which
according
to Mr. Huntly's report,
completed
your dress, were no where to be
found. That you should go forth on so
cold a night so slenderly appareled,
was almost incredible. Your reason or
your senses had deserted you, before so
rash an action could be meditated.
I now remembered the person I had
met in Norwalk. His resemblance to
your figure, his garb, which wanted hat,
coat, stockings and shoes, and your
absence
from your bed at that hour, were
remarkable coincidences: but why did
you disregard my call? Your name,
uttered by a voice that could not be
unknown, was surely sufficient to arrest
your steps.
Each hour added to the impatience
of your friends; to their recollections
and conjectures, I listened with a view
to extract from them some solution of
this mystery. At length, a story was
alluded to, of some one who, on the
preceding
night, had been heard walking
in the long room; to this was added, the
tale of your anxieties and wonders
occasioned
by the loss of certain manuscripts.
While ruminating upon these
incidents
,
and endeavouring to extract from
H 2
this intelligence a clue, explanatory of
your present situation, a single word,
casually dropped by your uncle,
instantly
illuminated my darkness and dispelled
my doubts.After all, said the old man,
ten to one, but Edgar himself was the
man whom we heard walking, but the
lad was asleep, and knew not what he
was about.
Surely said I, this inference is just.
His manuscripts could not be removed
by any hands but his own, since the rest
of mankind were unacquainted not only
with the place of their concealment, but
with their existence. None but a man,
insane or asleep, would wander forth so
slightly dressed, and none but a sleeper
would have disregarded my calls. This
conclusion was generally adopted, but
it gave birth in my mind, to infinite
inquietudes
.
You had roved into
Norwalk
,
a scene of inequalities, of
prominences
and pits, among which, thus
destitute
of the guidance of your senses,
you could scarcely fail to be destroyed,
or at least, irretreivably bewildered. I
painted to myself the dangers to which
you were subjected. Your careless feet
would bear you into some whirlpool or
to the edge of some precipice, some
internal
revolution or outward shock would
recall you to consciousness at some
perilous
moment. Surprise and fear would
disable you from taking seasonable or
suitable precautions, and your
destruction
be made sure.
The lapse of every new hour,
without
bringing tidings of your state,
enhanced
these fears. At length, the
propriety
of searching for you occurred,
Mr. Huntly and I determined to set out
upon this pursuit, as well as to
commission
others. A plan was laid by which
every accessible part of Norwalk, the
wilderness beyond the flats of Solebury,
and the valey of Chetasco, should be
traversed
and explored.
Scarcely had we equipped ourselves
for this expedition, when a messenger
arrived, who brought the disastrous
news of Indians being seen within these
precincts, and on the last night a farmer
was shot in his fields, a dwelling in
Chetasco
was burnt to the ground, and its
inhabitants murdered or made captives.
Rumour and inquiry had been busy, and
a plausible conjecture had been formed,
as to the course and number of the
enemies
.
They were said to be divided
into bands, and to amount in the whole
to thirty or forty wariors. This
messenger
had come to warn us of danger
which might impend, and to summon us
to join in the pursuit and extirpation of
these detestable foes.
Your uncle, whose alacrity and vigour
age had not abated, eagerly engaged in
this scheme. I was not averse to
contribute
my efforts to an end like this.
The road which we had previously
designed
to take, in search of my fugitive
pupil, was the same by which we must
trace or intercept the retreat of the
savages
.
Thus two purposes, equally
momentous
,
would be answered by the same
means.
Mr. Huntly armed himself with your
fusil; Inglefield supplied me with a gun;
during our absence the dwelling was
closed and locked, and your sisters
placed under the protection of Inglefield,
whose age and pacific sentiments
unfitted
him for arduous and sanguinary
enterprises. A troop of rustics was
collected, half of whom remained to
traverse Solebury and the other, whom
Mr. Huntly and I accompanied,
hastened
to Chetasco.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XXIV.
It
was noon day before we
reached
the theatre of action. Fear and
revenge
combined to make the people of
Chetasco diligent and zealous in their
own defence. The havock already
committed
had been mournful. To prevent
a repetition of the same calamities, they
resolved to hunt out the hostile foot-steps
and exact a merciless retribution.
It was likely that the enemy, on the
approach of day, had withdrawn from
the valley and concealed themselves in
the thickets, between the parrallel ridges
of the mountain. This space, which,
according to the object with which it is
compared is either a vale or the top of
an hill, was obscure and desolate. It
was undoubtedly the avenue by which
the robbers had issued forth, and by
which they would escape to the Ohio.
Here they might still remain, intending
to immerge from their concealment on
the next night, and perpetrate new
horrors
.
A certain distribution was made of
our number, so as to move in all
directions
at the same time. I will not dwell
upon particulars. It will suffice to say
that keen eyes and indefatigable feet,
brought us at last to the presence of the
largest number of these marauders.
Seven of them were slain by the edge
of a brook, where they sat wholly
unconscious
of the danger which hung over
them. Five escaped, and one of these
secured his retreat by wresting your
fusil from your uncle, and shooting him
dead. Before our companion could be
rescued or revenged, the assassin, with
the remnant of the troop, disappeared,
and bore away with him the fusil as a
trophy of his victory.
This disaster was deplored not only
on account of that life which had thus
been sacrificed, but because a sagacious
guide and intrepid leader was lost. His
acquaintance with the habits of the
Indians
,
and his experience in their wars
made him trace their foot-steps with more
certainty than any of his associates.
The pursuit was still continued, and
parties were so stationed that the escape
of the enemy was difficult, if not
impossible
.
Our search was unremitted, but
during twelve or fourteen hours,
unsuccessful
.
Queen Mab did not elude all
suspicion. Her hut was visited by
different
parties, but the old woman and
her dogs had disappeared.
Meanwhile your situation was not
forgotten. Every one was charged to
explore your foot-steps as well as those
of the savages, but this search was no
less unsuccessful than the former. None
had heard of you or seen you.
This continued till midnight. Three
of us, made a pause at a brook, and
intended to repair our fatigues by a
respite
of a few hours, but scarcely had we
stretched ourselves on the ground when
we were alarmed by a shot which seemed
to have been fired at a short distance.
We started on our feet and consulted
with each other on the measures to be
taken. A second, a third and a fourth
shot, from the same quarter, excited our
attention anew. Mab's hut was known
to stand at the distance and in the
direction
VOL. III. I
of this sound, and hither we resolved
to repair.
This was done with speed but with
the utmost circumspection. We shortly
gained the road that leads near this hut
and at length gained a view of the
building
.
Many persons were discovered, in
a sort of bustling inactivity, before the
hut. They were easily distinguised to
be friends, and were therefore
approached
without scruple.
The objects that presented
themselves
to a nearer view were five bodies
stretched upon the ground. Three of
them were savages. The fourth was a
girl, who though alive seemed to have
received a mortal wound. The fifth,
breathless and mangled and his features
almost concealed by the blood that
overspread
his face, was Edgar; the fugitive
for whom I had made such anxious
search.
About the same hour on the last
night I had met you hastening into
Norwalk
.
Now were you, lying in the midst
of savages, at the distance of thirty miles
from your home, and in a spot, which
it was impossible for you to have
reached
unless by an immense circuit over
rocks and thickets. That you had found
a rift at the basis of the hill, and thus
permeated its solidities, and thus
precluded
so tedious and circuitous a
journey
as must otherwise have been made,
was not to be imagined.
But whence arose this scene? It was
obvious to conclude that my associates
had surprised their enemies in this house,
and exacted from them the forfeit of their
crimes, but how you should have been
confounded with their foes, or whence
came the wounded girl was a subject of
astonishment.
You will judge how much this
surprise
was augmented when I was
informed
that the party whom we found had
been attracted hither by the same signals,
by which we had been alarmed. That
on reaching this spot you had been
discovered
,
alive, seated on the ground and
still sustaining the gun with which you
had apparently completed the
destruction
of so many adversaries. In a
moment
after their arrival you sunk down
and expired.
This scene was attended with
inexplicable
circumstances. The musquet
which lay beside you appeared to have
belonged to one of the savages. The
wound by which each had died was
single
.
Of the four shots we had
distinguished
at a distance, three of them were
therefore fatal to the Indians and the
fourth was doubtless that by which you
had fallen, yet three musquets only were
discoverable.
The arms were collected, and the
girl carried to the nearest house in the
arms of her father. Her situation was
deemed capable of remedy, and the
sorrow
and wonder which I felt at your
untimely and extraordinary fate, did not
hinder me from endeavouring to restore
the health of this unfortunate victim. I
reflected likewise that some light might
be thrown upon transactions so
mysterious
,
by the information which might be
collected from her story. Numberless
questions and hints were necessary to
extract from her a consistent or intelli
gible tale. She had been dragged, it
seems, for miles, at the heels of her
conquerors
,
who at length, stopped in a
cavern for the sake of some repose; all
slept but one, who sat and watched.
I 2
Something called him away, and, at the
same moment, you appeared at the
bottom
of the cave half naked and without
arms. You instantly supplied the last
deficiency, by seizing the gun and
tomhawk
of him who had gone forth, and
who had negligently left his weapons
behind. Then stepping over the bodies
of the sleepers, you rushed out of the
cavern.
She then mentioned your unexpected
return, her deliverance and flight, and
arrival at Deb's hut. You watched
upon the hearth and she fell asleep upon
the blanket. From this sleep she was
aroused by violent and cruel blows.
She looked up:you were gone and the
bed on which she lay was surrounded
by the men from whom she had so lately
escaped. One dragged her out of the
hut and levelled his gun at her breast.
At the moment when he touched the
trigger, a shot came from an unknown
quarter, and he fell at her feet. Of
subsequent
events she had an incoherent
recollection. The Indians were
successively
slain, and you came to her, and
interrogated and consoled her.
In your journey to the hut you were
armed. This in some degree accounted
for appearances, but where were your
arms? Three musquets only were
discovered
and these undoubtedly belonged
to your enemies.
I now had leisure to reflect upon your
destiny. I had arrived soon enough on
this shore merely to witness the
catastrophe
of two beings whom I most loved.
Both were overtaken by the same fate,
nearly at the same hour. The same
hand had possibly accomplished the
destruction
of uncle and nephew.
Now, however, I began to entertain
an hope that your state might not be
irretreivable. You had walked and
spoken
after the firing had ceased, and
your enemies had ceased to contend
with you. A wound had, no doubt,
been previously received. I had hastily
inferred that the wound was mortal, and
that life could not be recalled.
Occupied
with attention to the wailings of the
girl, and full of sorrow and perplexity
I had admitted an opinion which would
have never been adopted in different
circumstances. My acquaintance with
wounds would have taught me to regard
sunken muscles, lividness and cessation
of the pulse as mere indications of a
swoon, and not as tokens of death.
Perhaps my error was not
irreparable
.
By hastening to the hut, I might
ascertain your condition and at least
transport your remains to some dwelling
and finally secure to you the decencies
of burial.
Of twelve savages, discovered on the
preceding day, ten were now killed.
Two, at least remained, after whom the
pursuit was still zealously maintained.
Attention to the wounded girl, had
withdrawn
me from the party, and I had now
leisure to return to the scene of these
disasters. The sun had risen, and,
accompanied
by two others, I repaired
thither.
A sharp turn in the road, at the
entrance
of the field, set before us a starting
spectacle. An Indian, mangled by
repeated
wounds of bayonet and bullet,
was discovered. His musquet was stuck
in the ground, by way of beacon
attracting
our attention to the spot. Over this
space I had gone a few hours before,
and nothing like this was then seen.
The parties abroad, had hied away to a
distant quarter. Some invisible power
seemed to be enlisted in our defence and
to preclude the necessity of our arms.
We proceeded to the hut. The
savages
were there, but Edgar had risen and
flown! Nothing now seemed to be
incredible
.
You had slain three foes, and the
weapon with which the victory had been
achieved, had vanished. You had risen
from the dead, had assailed one of the
surviving enemies, had employed bullet
and dagger in his destruction, with both
of which you could only be supplied by
supernatural means, and had
disappeared
.
If any inhabitant of Chetasco had
done this, we should have heard of it.
But what remained? You were still
alive. Your strength was sufficient to
bear you from this spot. Why were you
still invisible and to what dangers might
you not be exposed, before you could
disinvolve yourself from the mazes of
this wilderness?
Once more I procured indefatigable
search to be made after you. It was
continued
till the approach of evening and
was fruitless. Inquiries were twice made
at the house where you were supplied
with food and intelligence. On the
second call I was astonished and
delighted
by the tidings received from the good
woman. Your person and demeanour
and arms were described, and mention
made of your resolution to cross the
southern ridge, and traverse the
Solebury
road with the utmost expedition.
The greater part of my inquietudes
were now removed. You were able to
eat and to travel, and there was little
doubt that a meeting would take place
between us on the next morning.
Meanwhile
,
I determined to concur with those
who pursued the remainder of the enemy.
I followed you, in the path that you were
said to have taken, and quickly joined a
numerous party who were searching for
those who, on the last night, had attacked
a plantation that lies near this, and
destroyed
the inhabitants.
I need not dwell upon our doublings
and circuities. The enemy was traced
to the house of Selby. They had
entered
,
they had put fire on the floor, but
were compelled to relinquish their prey.
Of what number they consisted could
not be ascertained, but one, lingering
behind his fellows, was shot, at the
entrance of the wood, and on the spot
where you chanced to light upon him.
Selby's house was empty, and before
the fire had made any progress we
extinguished
it. The drunken wretch whom
you encountered, had probably returned
from his nocturnal debauch, after we had
left the spot.
The flying enemy was pursued with
fresh diligence. They were found, by
various tokens, to have crossed the river,
and to have ascended the mountain. We
trod closely on their heels. When we
arrived at the promontory, described by
you, the fatigues of the night and day
rendered me unqualified to proceed, I
determined that this should be the bound
of my excursions. I was anxious to
obtain an interview with you, and unless
I paused here, should not be able to gain
Inglefield's as early in the morning as I
wished. Two others concurred with me
in this resolution and prepared to return
to this house which had been deserted
by its tenants till the danger was past
and which had been selected as the place
of rendezvous.
At this moment, dejected and weary,
I approached the ledge which severed
the head-land from the mountain. I
VOL. III K
marked the appearance of some one
stretched upon the ground where you
lay. No domestic animal would wander
hither and place himself upon this spot.
There was something likewise in the
appearance of the object that bespoke it
to be man, but if it were man, it was,
incontrovertibly, a savage and a foe. I
determined therefore to rouse you by a
bullet.
My decision was perhaps absurd. I
ought to have gained more certainty
before I hazarded your destruction. Be
that as it will, a moments lingering on
your part would have probably been
fatal. You started on your feet, and
fired. See the hole which your
random
shot made through my sleeve! This
surely was a day destined to be signalized
by hair-breadth escapes.
Your action seemed incontestably to
confirm my prognostics. Every one
hurried
to the spot and was eager to destroy
an enemy. No one hesitated to believe
that some of the shots aimed at you, had
reached their mark, and that you had
sunk to rise no more.
The gun which was fired and thrown
down was taken and examined. It had
been my companion in many a toilsome
expedition. It had rescued me and my
friends from a thousand deaths. In order
to recognize it, I needed only to touch
and handle it. I instantly discovered that
I held in my hand the fusil which I had
left with you on parting, with which your
uncle had equipped himself, and which
had been ravished from him by a savage.
What was I hence to infer respecting
the person of the last possessor?
My inquiries respecting you of the
woman whose milk and bread you had
eaten, were minute. You entered, she
said, with an hatchet and gun in your
hand. While you ate, the gun was laid
upon the table. She sat near, and the
piece became the object of inquisitive
attention. The stock and barrels were
described by her in such terms as left
no doubt that this was the
Fusil
.
A comparison of incidents enabled
me to trace the manner in which you
came into possession of this instrument.
One of those whom you found in the
cavern was the assassin of your uncle.
According to the girl's report, on issuing
from your hiding place, you seized a gun
that was unoccupied, and this gun
chanced
to be your own.
Its two barrels was probably the
cause of your success in that unequal
contest at Mab's hut. On recovering
from
deliquium,
you found it where it
had been dropped by you, out of sight
and unsuspected by the party that had
afterwards arrived. In your passage to
the river had it once more fallen into
hostile
hands, or, had you missed the way,
wandered to this promontory, and
mistaken
a troop of friends for a band of
Indian marauders?
Either supposition was dreadful. The
latter was the most plausible. No
motives
were conceivable by which one of
the fugitives could be induced to post
himself here, in this conspicuous station:
whereas, the road which lead you to the
summit of the hill, to that spot where
descent to the river road was practicable,
could not be found but by those who
were accustomed to traverse it. The
directions which you had exacted from
your hostess, proved your previous
unacquaintance
with these tracts.
I acquiesced in this opinion with an
heavy and desponding heart. Fate had
led us into a maze, which could only
terminate in the destruction of one or of
K 2
the other. By the breadth of an hair,
had I escaped death from your hand.
The same fortune had not befriended
you. After my tedious search, I had
lighted on you, forlorn, bewildered,
perishing
with cold and hunger. Instead
of recognizing and affording you relief,
I compelled you to leap into the river,
from a perilous height, and had desisted
from my persecution only when I had
bereaved you of life, and plunged you
to the bottom of the gulf.
My motives in coming to America
were numerous and mixed. Among
these was the parental affection with
which you had inspired me. I came
with fortune and a better gift than
fortune
in my hand. I intended to bestow
both upon you, not only to give you
competence
,
but one who would endear to
you that competence, who would
enhance
,
by participating, every
gratification
.
My schemes were now at an end.
You were gone, beyond the reach of my
benevolence and justice. I had robbed
your two sisters of a friend and guardian.
It was some consolation to think that it
was in my power to stand, with regard
to them, in your place, that I could
snatch them from the poverty,
dependence
and humiliation, to which your
death and that of your uncle had reduced
them.
I was now doubly weary of the
enterprise
in which I was engaged, and
returned
,
with speed, to this rendezvouz.
My companions have gone to know the
state of the family who resided under
this roof and left me to beguile the
tedious moments in whatever manner I
pleased.
I have omitted mentioning one
incident
that happened between the detection
of your flight and our expedition to
Chetasco
.
Having formed a plausible
conjecture
as to him who walked in the
Long-room, it was obvious to conclude
that he who purloined your manuscripts
and the walker were the same personage.
It was likewise easily inferred that the
letters were secreted in the Cedar Chest
or in some other part of the room.
Instances
similar to this have heretofore
occurred. Men have employed anxious
months in search of that which, in a freak
of Noctambulation, was hidden by their
own hands.
A search was immediately
commenced
,
and your letters were found,
carefully
concealed between the rafters and
shingles of the roof, in a spot, where, if
suspicion had not been previously
excited
,
they would have remained till the
vernal rains and the summer heats, had
insensibly destroyed them. This
pacquet
I carried with me, knowing the
value which you set upon them, and
there being no receptacle equally safe,
but your own cabinet, which was locked.
Having, as I said, reached this house,
and being left alone, I bethought me of
the treasure I possessed. I was
unacquainted
with the reasons for which these
papers were so precious. They
probably
had some momentous and intimate
connection with your own history. As
such they could not be of little value to
me, and this moment of inoccupation and
regrets, was as suitable as any other to
the task of perusing them. I drew them
forth, therefore, and laid them on the
table in this chamber.
The rest is known to you. During a
momentary absence you entered.
Surely
no interview of ancient friends ever
took place in so unexpected and abrupt
a manner. You were dead. I mourned
for you, as one whom I loved, and whom
fate had snatched forever from my sight.
Now, in a blissful hour, you had risen,
and my happiness in thus embracing you,
is tenfold greater than would have been
experienced, if no uncertainties and perils
had protracted our meeting.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XXV.
Here
ended the tale of
Sarsefield
.
Humiliation and joy were mingled
in my heart. The events that preceded
my awakening in the cave were now
luminous and plain. What explication
was more obvious? What but this
solution
ought to have been suggested by
the conduct I had witnessed in Clithero?
Clithero! Was not this the man whom
Clithero had robbed of his friend? Was
not this the lover of Mrs. Lorimer, the
object of the persecutions of Wiatte?
Was it not now given me to investigate
the truth of that stupendous tale? To
dissipate the doubts which obstinately
clung to my imagination respecting it?
But soft! Had not Sarsefield said that
he was married? Was Mrs. Lorimer so
speedily forgotten by him, or was the
narrative of Clithero the web of
imposture
or the raving of
insanity
?
These new ideas banished all
personal
considerations from my mind. I
looked eagerly into the face of my friend,
and exclaimed in a dubious accentHow
say you? Married? When? To whom?
Yes, Huntly, I am wedded to the
most excellent of women. To her am
I indebted for happiness and wealth and
dignity and honour. To her do I owe
the power of being the benefactor and
protector of you and your sisters. She
longs to embrace you as a son. To
become truly her son, will depend upon
your own choice and that of one, who
was the companion of our voyage.
Heavens! cried I, in a transport of
exultation and astonishment. Of whom
do you speak. Of the mother of Clarice?
The sister of Wiatte? The sister of the
ruffian who laid snares for her life? Who
pursued you and the unhappy Clithero,
with the bitterest animosity?
My friend started at these sounds as
if the earth had yawned at his feet. His
countenance was equally significant of
terror and rage. As soon as he regained
the power of utterance, he spoke
Clithero
!
Curses light upon thy lips for
having uttered that detested name!
Thousands of miles have I flown to
shun the hearing of it. Is the madman
here? Have you set eyes upon him?
Does he yet crawl upon the face of the
earth? Unhappy? Unparalleled, unheard
of, thankless miscreant! Has he told his
execrable falsehoods here? Has he dared
to utter names so sacred as those of
Euphemia
Lorimer and Clarice?
VOL. III L
He has: He has told a tale, that had
all the appearances of truth
Out upon the villain! The truth!
Truth would prove him to be unnatural;
develish; a thing for which no language
has yet provided a name! He has called
himself unhappy? No doubt, a victim to
injustice! Overtaken by unmerited
calamity
.
Say! Has he fooled thee with
such tales?
No. His tale was a catalogue of
crimes and miseries of which he was the
author and sufferer. You know not his
motives, his horrors:
His deeds were monstrous and
infernal
.
His motives were sordid and
flagitious
.
To display all their ugliness and
infamy was not his province. No: He
did not tell you that he stole at midnight
to the chamber of his mistress: a woman
who astonised the world by her loftiness
and magnanimity; by indefatigable
beneficence
and unswerving equity; who had
lavished on this wretch, whom she
snatched from the dirt, all the goods of
fortune; all the benefits of education; all
the treasures of love; every provocation
to gratitude; every stimulant to justice.
He did not tell you that in
recompense
for every benefit, he stole upon her
sleep and aimed a dagger at her breast.
There was no room for flight or
ambiguity
or prevarication. She whom he meant
to murder stood near, saw the lifted
weapon
,
and heard him confess and glory in
his purposes.
No wonder that the shock bereft her,
for a time, of life. The interval was
seized by the ruffian to effect his escape.
The rebukes of justice, were shunned by
a wretch conscious of his inexpiable guilt.
These things he has hidden from you,
and has supplied their place by a tale
specious as false.
No. Among the number of his crimes,
hypocrisy is not to be numbered. These
things are already known to me: he
spared
himself too little in the narrative. The
excellencies of his lady; her claims to
gratitude and veneration, were urged
beyond their true bounds. His attempts
upon her life, were related. It is true
that he desired and endeavoured to
destroy her.
How? Has he told you this?
He has told me all. Alas! the
criminal
intention has been amply expiated
What mean you? Whence and how
came he hither. Where is he now? I
will not occupy the same land, the same
world with him. Have this woman and
her daughter lighted on the shore
haunted by this infernal and implacable
enemy?
Alas! It is doubtful whether he
exists. If he lives, he is no longer to be
feared; but he lives not. Famine and
remorse have utterly consumed him.
Famine? Remorse? You talk in
riddles
.
He has immured himself in the
desert. He has abjured the intercourse
of mankind. He has shut himself in
caverns where famine must inevitably
expedite that death for which he longs
as the only solace of his woes. To no
imagination are his offences blacker and
more odious than to his own. I had hopes
of rescuing him from this fate, but my
own infirmities and errors have afforded
me sufficient occupation.
Sarsefield renewed his imprecations
on the memory of that unfortunate man:
and his inquiries as to the circumstances
that led him into this remote district. His
inquiries were not to be answered by
one in my present conditionMy
languors
and fatigues had now gained a
pitch that was insupportable. The wound
Y 2
in my face had been chafed, and inflamed
by the cold water and the bleak air; and
the pain attending it, would no longer
suffer my attention to stray. I sunk
upon the floor, and intreated him to
afford me the respite of a few hours
repose.
He was sensible of the
deplorableness
of my condition, and child himself
for the negligence of which he had
already
been guilty. He lifted me to the
bed, and deliberated on the mode he
should pursue for my relief. Some
molifying
application to my wound, was
immediately
necessary; but in our present
lonely condition, it was not at hand. It
could only be procured from a distance.
It was proper therefore to hasten to the
nearest inhabited dwelling, which
belonged
to one, by name Walton, and
supply himself with such medicines as
could be found.
Meanwhile there was no danger of
molestation and intrusion. There was
reason to expect the speedy return of
those who had gone in pursuit of the
savages. This was their place of
rendezvous
,
and hither they appointed to
re-assemble before the morrow's dawn.
The distance of the neighbouring farm
was small, and Sarsefield promised to be
expeditious. He left me to myself and
my own ruminations.
Harrassed by fatigue and pain, I had
yet power to ruminate on that series of
unparalleled events, that had lately
happened
.
I wept, but my tears flowed
from a double source; from sorrow, on
account of the untimely fate of my uncle,
and from joy, that my sisters were
preserved
,
that Sarsefield had returned and
was not unhappy.
I reflected on the untoward destiny
of Clithero. Part of his calamity
consisted
in the consciousness of having killed
his patronness; but it now appeared,
though by some infatuation, I had not
previously suspected, that the first
impulse
of sorrow in the lady, had been
weakened by reflection and by time.
That the prejudice persuading her that
her life and that of her brother were to
endure and to terminate together, was
conquered by experience or by
argument
.
She had come, in company with
Sarsefield and Clarice to America. What
influence might these events have upon
the gloomy meditations of Clithero.
Was it possible to bring them together;
to win the maniac from his solitude,
wrest from him his fatal purposes, and
restore him to communion with the
beings whose imagined indignation is
the torment of his life.
These musings were interrupted by
a sound from below which were easily
interpreted into tokens of the return of
those with whom Sarsefield had parted
at the promontory, voices were confused
and busy but not turbulent. They
entered the lower room and the motion
of chairs and tables shewed that they
were preparing to rest themselves after
their toils.
Few of them were unacquainted with
me, since they probably were residents
in this district. No inconvenience,
therefore
,
would follow from an interview,
though, on their part, wholly
unexpected
.
Besides, Sarsefield would
speedily
return and none of the present
visitants would be likely to withdraw to
this apartment.
Meanwhile I lay upon the bed, with
my face turned towards the door, and
languidly gazing at the ceiling and walls.
Just then a musquet was discharged in
the room below. The shock affected me
mechanically and the first impulse of
surprise, made me almost start upon my
feet.
The sound was followed by
confusion
and bustle. Some rushed forth and
called on each other to run different
ways, and the words That is he
Stop him were spoken in a tone of
eagerness, and rage. My weakness and
pain were for a moment forgotten, and
my whole attention was bent to discover
the meaning of this hubbub. The
musquet
which I had brought with me to
this chamber, lay across the bed.
Unknowing
of the consequences of this
affray, with regard to myself, I was
prompted by a kind of self-preserving
instinct, to lay hold of the gun, and
prepare
to repell any attack that might be
made upon me.
A few moments elapsed when I
thought I heard light footsteps in the
entry leading to this room. I had no
time to construe these signals, but
watching
fearfully the entrance, I grasped my
weapon with new force, and raised it so
as to be ready at the moment of my
danger. I did not watch long. A figure
cautiously thrust itself forward. The
first glance was sufficient to inform me
that this intruder was an Indian, and, of
consequence, an enemy. He was
unarmed
.
Looking eagerly on all sides, he
at last spied me as I lay. My
appearance
threw him into consternation, and
after the fluctuation of an instant, he
darted to the window, threw up the sash,
and leaped out upon the ground.
His flight might have been easily
arrested by my shot, but surprize, added
to my habitual antipathy to bloodshed,
unless in cases of absolute necessity,
made me hesitate. He was gone, and I
was left to mark the progress of the
drama
.
The silence was presently broken
by firing at a distance. Three shots, in
quick succession, were followed by the
deepest pause.
That the party, recently arrived, had
brought with them one or more captives,
and that by some sudden effort, the
prisoners
had attempted to escape, was the
only supposition that I could form. By
what motives either of them could be
induced to seek concealment in my
chamber
,
could not be imagined.
I now heard a single step on the
threshold below. Some one entered the
common room. He traversed the floor
during a few minutes, and then,
ascending
the stair-case, he entered my
chamber
.
It was Sarsefield. Trouble and
dismay were strongly written on his
countenance. He seemed totally
unconscious
of my presence, his eyes were
fixed upon the floor, and as he continued
to move across the room, he heaved
forth deep sighs.
This deportment was mournful and
mysterious. It was little in unison with
those appearances which he wore at our
parting, and must have been suggested
by some event that had since happened.
My curiosity impelled me to recall him
from his reverie. I rose and seizing
him by the arm, looked at him with an
air of inquisitive anxiety. It was
needless
to speak.
He noticed my movement, and
turning
towards me, spoke in a tone of some
resentmentWhy did you deceive me?
Did you not say Clithero was dead?
I said so because it was my belief.
Know you any thing to the contrary?
Heaven grant that he is still alive, and
that our mutual efforts may restore him
to peace.
Heaven grant, replied my friend,
with a vehemence that bordered upon
fury. Heaven grant that he may live
thousands of years, and know not, in
their long course, a moments respite
from remorse and from anguish; but this
prayer is fruitless. He is not dead, but
VOL. III. M
death hovers over him. Should he live,
he will live only to defy justice and
perpetrate
new horrors. My skill might
perhaps save him, but a finger shall not
be moved to avert his fate.
Little did I think, that the wretch
whom my friends rescued from the power
of the savages, and brought wounded
and expiring hither was Clithero. They
sent for me in haste to afford him surgical
assistance. I found him stretched upon
the floor below, deserted, helpless and
bleeding. The moment I beheld him,
he was recognized. The last of evils
was to look upon the face of this assassin,
but that evil is past, and shall never be
endured again.
Rise and come with me.
Accommodation
is prepared for you at Walcots.
Let us leave this house, and the moment
you are able to perform a journey,
abandon
forever this district.
I could not readily consent to this
proposal. Clithero had been delivered
from captivity but was dying for want of
that aid which Sarsefield was able to
afford. Was it not inhuman to desert
him in this extremity? What offence had
he committed that deserved such
implacable
vengeance? Nothing I had
heard from Sarsefield was in
contradiction
to his own story. His deed,
imperfectly
observed, would appear to be
atrocious
and detestable, but the view of all its
antecedent and accompanying events and
motives, would surely place it in the
list not of crimes, but of misfortunes.
But what is that guilt which no
penitence
can expiate? Had not Clithero's
remorse been more than adequate to
crimes far more deadly and enormous
than this? This, however, was no time
to argue with the passions of Sarsefield.
Nothing but a repetition of Clithero's
tale, could vanquish his prepossessions
and mollify his rage, but this repetition
was impossible to be given by me, till a
moment of safety and composure.
These thoughts made me linger, but
hindered me from attempting to change
the determination of my friend. He
renewed his importunities for me to fly
with him. He dragged me by the arm,
and wavering and reluctant I followed
where he chose to lead. He crossed
the common-room, with hurried steps
and eyes averted from a figure, which
instantly fastened my attention.
It was, indeed, Clithero, whom I now
beheld, supine, polluted with blood, his
eyes closed and apparently insensible.
This object was gazed at with emotions
that rooted me to the spot. Sarsefield,
perceiving me determined to remain
where I was, rushed out of the house,
and disappeared.
EDGAR HUNTLY.
CHAPTER XXVI.
I hung
over the unhappy wretch
whose emaciated form and rueful
features
,
sufficiently bespoke that savage
hands had only completed that
destruction
which his miseries had begun. He
was mangled by the tom-hawk in a
shocking
manner, and there was little hope
that human skill could save his life.
I was sensible of nothing but
compassion
.
I acted without design, when
seating myself on the floor I raised his
head and placed it on my knees. This
movement awakened his attention, and
opening his eyes he fixed them on my
M 2
countenance. They testified neither
insensibility
,
nor horror nor distraction. A
faint emotion of surprise gave way to an
appearance of tranquillityHaving
perceived
these tokens of a state less
hopeless
than I at first imagined, I spoke to
him:My friend! How do you feel?
Can any thing be done for you?
He answered me, in a tone more firm
and with more coherence of ideas than
previous appearances had taught me to
expect. No, said he, thy kindness good
youth, can avail me nothing. The end
of my existence here is at hand. May
my guilt be expiated by the miseries that
I have suffered, and my good deeds only
attend me to the presence of my divine
judge.
I am waiting, not with trembling or
dismay, for this close of my sorrows. I
breathed but one prayer, and that prayer
has been answered. I asked for an
interview
with thee, young man, but
feeling
as I now feel, this interview, so much
desired, was beyond my hope. Now
thou art come, in due season, to hear
the last words that I shall need to utter.
I wanted to assure thee that thy
efforts for my benefit were not useless.
They have saved me from murdering
myself, a guilt more inexpiable than any
which it was in my power to commit.
I retired to the innermost recess of
Norwalk, and gained the summit of an
hill, by subterranean paths. This hill
I knew to be on all sides inaccessible to
human footsteps, and the subterranean
passages was closed up by stones. Here
I believed my solitude exempt from
interruption
and my death, in consequence
of famine, sure.
This persuasion was not taken away
by your appearance on the opposite
steep. The chasm which severed us I
knew to be impassable. I withdrew
from your sight.
Some time after, awakening from a
long sleep, I found victuals beside me.
He that brought it was invisible. For a
time, I doubted whether some messenger
of heaven had not interposed for my
salvation
.
How other than by
supernatural
means, my retreat should be explored,
I was unable to conceive. The summit
was encompassed by dizzy and profound
gulfs, and the subterranean passages was
still closed.
This opinion, though corrected by
subsequent reflection, tended to change
the course of my desperate thoughts.
My hunger, thus importunately urged,
would not abstain, and I ate of the food
that was provided. Henceforth I
determined
to live, to resume the path of
obscurity and labour, which I had
relinquished
,
and wait till my God should
summon me to retribution. To
anticipate
his call, is only to redouble our
guilt.
I designed not to return to
Inglefield's
service, but to chuse some other
and remoter district. Meanwhile, I had
left in his possession, a treasure, which
my determination to die, had rendered of
no value, but which, my change of
resolution
,
restored. Inclosed in a box at
Inglefield's, were the memoirs of
Euphemia
Lorimer, by which in all my
vicissitudes
,
I had been hitherto accompanied,
and from which I consented to part only
because I had refused to live. My
existence
was now to be prolonged and this
manuscript was once more to constitute
the torment and the solace of my being.
I hastened to Inglefield's by night.
There was no need to warn him of my
purpose. I desired that my fate should
be an eternal secret to my ancient master
and his neighbours. The apartment,
containing my box was well known, and
easily accessible.
The box was found but broken and
rifled of its treasure. My transports of
astonishment, and indignation and grief
yielded to the resumption of my fatal
purpose. I hastened back to the hill,
and determined anew to perish.
This mood continued to the evening
of the ensuing day. Wandering over
rocks and pits, I discovered the
manuscript
,
lying under a jutting precipice.
The chance that brought it hither was
not less propitious and miraculous than
that by which I had been supplied with
food. It produced a similar effect upon
my feelings, and, while in possession of
this manuscript I was reconciled to the
means of life. I left the mountain, and
traversing the wilderness, stopped in
Chetasco. That kind of employment
which I sought was instantly procured;
but my new vocation was scarcely
assumed
when a band of savages invaded
our security.
Rambling in the desert, by moonlight,
I encountered these foes. They rushed
upon me, and after numerous wounds
which, for the present, neither killed nor
disabled me, they compelled me to keep
pace with them in their retreat. Some
hours have passed since the troop was
overtaken, and my liberty redeemed.
Hardships, and repeated wounds,
inflicted
at the moment when the invaders
were surprised and slain, have brought
me to my present condition. I rejoice
that my course is about to terminate.
Here the speaker was interrupted by
the tumultuous entrance of the party,
by whom he had been brought hither.
Their astonishment at seeing me,
sustaining
the head of the dying man, may
be easily conceived. Their surprise was
more strongly excited by the
disappearance
of the captive whom they had left
in this apartment, bound hand and foot.
It now appeared that of the savage troop
who had adventured thus far in search
of pillage and blood, all had been
destroyed
but two, who, had been led hither
as prisoners. On their entrance into this
house, one of the party had been sent
to Walcot's to summon Sarsefield to the
aid of the wounded man, while others
had gone in search of chords to secure
the arms and legs of the captives, who
had hitherto been manacled imperfectly.
The chords were brought and one
of them was bound, but the other, before
the same operation was begun upon him,
broke, by a sudden effort, the feeble
ligatures
by which he was at present
constrained
,
and seizing a musquet that lay
near him, fired on his enemies, and then
rushed out of doors. All eagerly
engaged
in the pursuit. The savage was
fleet as a deer and finally eluded his
pursuers.
While their attention was thus
engaged
abroad, he that remained found
means to extricate his wrists and ancles
from his bonds and betaking himself to
the stairs, escaped, as I before described,
through the window of the room which
I had occupied. They pestered me with
their curiosity and wonder, for I was
known to all of them; but waving the
discussion of my own concerns I
intreated
their assistance to carry Clithero
to the chamber and the bed which I had
just deserted.
I now in spite of pain, fatigue and
watchfulness, set out to go to Walton's.
Sarsefield was ready to receive me at
the door, and the kindness and
compassion
of the family were active in my
behalf. I was conducted to a chamber
and provided with suitable attendance
and remedies.
I was not unmindful of the more
deplorable condition of Clithero. I
incessantly
VOL. III. N
meditated on the means for
his relief. His case stood in need of
all the vigilance and skill of a physician,
and Sarsefield was the only one of that
profession whose aid could be seasonably
administered. Sarsefield therefore must
be persuaded to bestow this aid.
There was but one mode of
conquering
his abhorrence of this man.
To prepossess my friend with the belief
of the innocence of Clithero, or to soothe
him into pity by a picture of remorse
and suffering. This could best be done,
and in the manner most conformable to
truth, by a simple recital of the incidents
that had befallen, and by repeating the
confession which had been extorted from
Clithero.
I requested all but my friend to
leave my chamber, and then, soliciting a
patient hearing, began the narrative
of Waldegrave's death! of the detection
of Clithero beneath the shade of the elm!
of the suspicions which were thence
produced; and of the forest interview to
which these suspicions gave birth; I
then repeated, without variation or
addition
,
the tale which was then told. I
likewise
mentioned my subsequent
transactions
in Norwalk so far as they illustrated
the destiny of Clithero.
During this recital, I fixed my eyes
upon the countenance of Sarsefield,
and watched every emotion as it rose or
declined. With the progress of my tale,
his indignation and his fury grew less,
and at length gave place to horror and
compassion.
His seat became uneasy, his pulse
throbbed with new vehemence. When I
came to the motives which prompted
the unhappy man to visit the chamber of
his mistress, he started from his seat,
and sometimes strode across the floor
in a troubled mood, and sometimes stood
before me, with his breath almost
suspended
in the eagerness of his attention.
When I mentioned the lifted dagger,
the shriek from behind, and the
apparition
that interposed, he shuddered and
drew back as if a dagger had been aimed
at his breast.
When the tale was done, some time
elapsed in mutual and profound silence.
My friend's thoughts were involved in
a mournful and indefinable reverie.
From this he at length recovered and
spoke.
It is true. A tale like this could
never be the fruit of invention or be
invented
to deceive. He has done himself
injustice. His character was spotless
and fair: All his moral properties seemed
to have resolved themselves into
gratitude
fidelity and honour.
We parted at the door, late in the
evening, as he mentioned, and he guessed
truly that subsequent reflection had
induced
me to return and to disclose the
truth to Mrs. Lorimer. Clarice relieved
by the sudden death of her friend, and
unexpectedly by all, arrived at the same
hour.
These tidings, astonished, afflicted,
and delighted the lady. Her brother's
death had been long believed by all but
herself. To find her doubts verified,
and his existence ascertained was the
dearest consolation that he ever could
bestow. She was afflicted at the proofs
that had been noted of the continuance
of his depravity, but she dreaded no
danger to herself from his malignity or
vengeance.
The ignorance and prepossessions of
this woman were remarkable. On this
subject only she was perverse, headlong,
obstinate. Her anxiety to benefit this
arch-ruffian occupied her whole thoughts
and allowed her no time to reflect upon
the reasonings or remonstrances of
N 2
others. She could not be prevailed on
to deny herself to his visits, and I parted
from her in the utmost perplexity.
A messenger came to me at mid-night
intreating my immediate presence. Some
disaster had happened, but of what
kind the messenger was unable to tell.
My fears easily conjured up the image
of Wiatte. Terror scarcely allowed me
to breathe. When I entered the house of
Mrs. Lorimer, I was conducted to her
chamber. She lay upon the bed in a
state of stupefaction, that rose from
some mental cause. Clarice sat by her,
wringing her hands and pouring forth
her tears without intermission. Neither
could explain to me the nature of the scene.
I made inquiries of the servants and
attendants
.
They merely said that the
family
as usual had retired to rest, but their
lady's bell rung with great violence, and
called them in haste, to her chamber,
where they found her in a swoon upon
the floor and the young lady in the
utmost
affright and perturbation.
Suitable means being used Mrs.
Lorimer had, at length, recovered, but
was still nearly insensible. I went to
Clithero's apartments but he was not to
be found, and the domestics informed me
that since he had gone with me, he had
not returned. The doors between this
chamber and the court were open; hence
that some dreadful interview had taken
place, perhaps with Wiatte, was an
unavoidable conjecture. He had
withdrawn
,
however, without committing any
personal injury.
I need not mention my reflections
upon this scene. All was tormenting
doubt and suspence till the morning
arrived, and tidings were received that
Wiatte had been killed in the streets:
This event was antecedent to that which
had occasioned Mrs. Lorimer's distress
and alarm. I now remembered that
fatal prepossession by which the lady was
governed, and her frantic belief that
her death and that of her brother were
to fall out at the same time. Could
some witness of his death, have brought
her tidings of it: Had he penetrated,
unexpected and unlicensed to her
chamber
,
and were these the effects produced
by the intelligence?
Presently I knew that not only Wiatte
was dead, but that Clithero had killed him.
Clithero had not been known to return
and was no where to be found. He
then was the bearer of these tidings, for
none but he could have found access or
egress without disturbing the servants.
These doubts were at length at an
end. In a broken and confused manner,
and after the lapse of some days the
monstrous and portentous truth was
disclosed. After our interview, the lady
and her daughter had retired to the same
chamber; the former had withdrawn to
her closet and the latter to bed. Some
one's entrance alarmed the lady, and
coming forth after a moment's pause,
the spectacle which Clithero has too
faithfully described, presented itself.
What could I think? A life of
uniform
hypocrisy or a sudden loss of reason
were the only suppositions to be formed.
Clithero was the parent of fury and
abhorrence
in my heart. In either case I
started at the name. I shuddered at the
image of the apostate or the maniac.
What? Kill the brother whose
existence
was interwoven with that of his
benefactress and his friend? Then
hasten to her chamber, and attempt
her life? Lift a dagger to destroy her
who had been the author of his being
and his happiness?
He that could meditate a deed like
this was no longer man. An agent from
Hell had mastered his faculties. He was
become the engine of infernal malice
against whom it was the duty of all
mankind
to rise up in arms and never to
desist till, by shattering it to atoms, its
power to injure was taken away.
All inquiries to discover the place of
his retreat were vain. No wonder
methought
that he wrapt himself in the
folds of impenetrable secrecy. Curbed,
checked, baffled in the midst of his
career, no wonder that he shrunk into
obscurity, that he fled from justice and
revenge, that he dared not meet the
rebukes
of that eye which, dissolving in
tenderness or flashing with disdain, had
ever been irresistable.
But how shall I describe the lady's
condition? Clithero she had cherished
from his infancy. He was the stay, the
consolation, the pride of her life. His
projected alliance with her daughter,
made him still more dear. Her
eloquence
was never tired of expatiating
on his purity and rectitude. No wonder
that she delighted in this theme, for he
was her own work. His virtues were
the creatures of her bounty.
How hard to be endured was this sad
reverse? She can be tranquil, but
never more will she be happy. To
promote
her forgetfulness of him, I
persuaded
her to leave her country, which
contained a thousand memorials of past
calamity, and which was lapsing fast
into civil broils. Clarice has
accompanied
us, and time may effect the
happiness
of others, by her means, though
she can never remove the melancholy of
her mother.
I have listened to your tale, not
without compassion. What would you
have me to do? To prolong his life,
would be merely to protract his misery.
He can never be regarded with
complacency
by my wife. He can never be
thought of without shuddering by
Clarice
.
Common ills are not without a cure
less than death, but here, all remedies
are vain. Consciousness itself is the
malady; the pest; of which he only is
cured who ceases to think.
I could not but assent to this mournful
conclusion; yet, though death was better
to Clithero than life, could not some
of his mistakes be rectified? Euphemia
Lorimer, contrary to his belief, was still
alive. He dreamed that she was dead,
and a thousand evils were imagined to
flow from that death. This death and
its progeny of ills, haunted his fancy,
and added keenness to his remorse. Was
it not our duty to rectify this error?
Sarsefield reluctantly assented to the
truth of my arguments on this head.
He consented to return, and afford the
dying man, the consolation of knowing
that the being whom he adored as a
benefactor
and parent, had not been deprived
of existence, though bereft of peace by
his act.
During Sarsefield's absence my mind
was busy in revolving the incidents that
had just occured. I ruminated the last
words of Clithero. There was somewhat
in his narrative that was obscure and
contradictory. He had left the
manuscript
which he so much and so justly
prized, in his cabinet. He entered the
chamber in my absence, and found the
cabinet unfastened and the manuscript
gone. It was I by whom the cabinet
was opened, but the manuscript
supposed
to be contained in it, was buried
in the earth beneath the elm. How
should Clithero be unacquainted with its
situation, since none but Clithero could
have dug for it this grave?
This mystery vanished when I
reflected
on the history of my own
manuscript
.
Clithero had buried his treasure
with his own hands as mine had been
VOL. III. O
secreted by myself, but both acts had
been performed during sleep. The deed
was neither prompted by the will, nor
noticed by the senses of him, by whom it
was done. Disastrous and humiliating
is the state of man! By his own hands,
is constructed the mass of misery and
error in which his steps are forever invol
ved.
Thus it was with thy friend.
Hurried
on by phantoms too indistinct to be
now recalled, I wandered from my
chamber to the desart. I plunged into
some unvisited cavern, and easily
proceeded
till I reached the edge of a pit.
There my step was deceived, and I
tumbled
headlong from the precipice. The
fall bereaved me of sense, and I continued
breathless and motionless during the
remainder of the night and the
ensuing
day.
How little cognizance have men over
the actions and motives of each other?
How total is our blindness with regard
to our own performances! Who would
have sought me in the bowels of this
mountain? Ages might have passed
away, before my bones would be
discovered
in this tomb, by some traveller
whom curiosity had prompted to explore
it.
I was roused from these reflections
by Sarsefield's return. Inquiring into
Clithero's condition; he answered that
the unhappy man was insensible, but
that notwithstanding numerous and
dreadful gashes, in different parts of
his body, it was possible that by
submitting
to the necessary treatment, he might
recover.
Encouraged by this
information
, I
endeavoured to awaken the zeal and
compassion of my friend in Clithero's
behalf. He recoiled with involuntary
shuddering from any task which would
confine him to the presence of this man.
Time and reflection he said, might
introduce
different sentiments and feelings,
but at present he could not but regard
this person as a maniac, whose disease
was irremediable, and whose existence
could not be protracted, but to his own
misery and the misery of others.
Finding him irreconcilably averse to
any scheme, connected with the welfare
of Clithero, I began to think that his
assistance as a surgeon was by no means
necessary. He had declared that the
sufferer needed nothing more than
common
treatment, and to this the skill of a
score of aged women in this district,
furnished with simples culled from the
forest, and pointed out, of old time, by
Indian
Leeches
was no less adequate
than that of Sarsefield. These women
were ready and officious in their charity,
and none of them were prepossessed
against the sufferer by a knowledge of his
genuine story.
Sarsefield, meanwhile, was impatient
for my removal to Inglefield's habitation,
and that venerable friend was no less
impatient to receive me. My hurts were
superficial, and my strength sufficiently
repaired by a night's repose. Next day,
I went thither, leaving Clithero to the
care of his immediate neighbours.
Sarsefield's engagements compelled
him to prosecute his journey into
Virginia
,
from which he had somewhat
deviated, in order to visit Solebury. He
proposed to return in less than a month
and then to take me in his company to
New-York. He has treated me with
paternal tenderness, and insists upon the
previlege of consulting for my interest,
as if he were my real father.
Meanwhile
,
these views have been disclosed
to Inglefield, and it is with him that I
O 2
am to remain, with my sisters, until his
return.
My reflections have been various and
tumultuous. They have been busy in
relation to you, to Weymouth, and
especially
to Clithero. The latter polluted
with gore and weakened by abstinence,
fatigue and the loss of blood, appeared in
my eyes, to be in a much more
dangerous
condition than the event proved him
to be. I was punctually informed of
the progress of his cure, and proposed in
a few days to visit him. The duty of
explaining the truth, respecting the
present
condition of Mrs. Lorimer, had
devolved upon me. By imparting this
intelligence, I hoped to work the most
auspicious revolutions in his feelings,
and prepared therefore, with alacrity, for
an interview.
In this hope I was destined to be
disappointed. On the morning on which
I intended to visit him, a messenger
arrived from the house in which he was
entertained, and informed us that the
family on entering the sick man's
apartment
,
had found it deserted. It appeared
that Clithero, had, during the night, risen
from his bed, and gone secretly forth.
No traces of his flight have since been
discovered.
But, O! my friend? The death of
Waldegrave, thy brother, is at length
divested of uncertainty and mystery.
Hitherto, I had been able to form no
conjecture respecting it, but the solution
was found shortly after this time.
Queen Mab, three days after my
adventure, was seized in her hut on
suspicion
of having aided and counselled
her countrymen, in their late
depredations
.
She was not to be awed or
intimidated by the treatment she
received
,
but readily confessed and gloried
in the mischief she had done; and
accounted
for it by enumerating the injuries
which she had received from her
neighbours
.
These injuries consisted in
contemptuous
or neglectful treatment, and in
the rejection of groundless and absurd
claims. The people of Chetasco were
less obsequious to her humours than
those of Solebury, her ancient
neighbourhood
,
and her imagination brooded for
a long time, over nothing but schemes
of revenge. She became sullen, irascible
and spent more of her time in solitude
than ever.
A troop of her countrymen at length
visited her hut. Their intentions being
hostile, they concealed from the
inhabitants
their presence in this quarter of the
country. Some motives induced them
to withdraw and postpone, for the
present, the violence which they
meditated
.
One of them, however, more
sanguinary
and audacious than the rest would
not depart, without some gratification
of his vengeance. He left his associates
and penetrated by night into Solebury,
resolving to attack the first human being
whom he should meet. It was the fate of thy
unhappy brother to encounter this
ruffian
,
whose sagacity made him forbear to
tear away the usual trophy from the dead,
least he should afford grounds for
suspicion
as to the authors of the evil.
Satisfied with this exploit he rejoined
his companions, and after an interval of
three weeks returned with a more
numerous
party, to execute a more extensive
project of destruction. They were
councelled
and guided, in all their movements,
by Queen Mab, who now explained these
particulars, and boldly defied her
oppressors
.
Her usual obstinacy and
infatuation induced her to remain in her
ancient dwelling and prepare to meet the
consequences.
This disclosure awakened anew all
the regrets and anguish which flowed
from that disaster. It has been
productive
,
however, of some benefit.
Suspicions
and doubts, by which my soul was
harrassed, and which were injurious to
the innocent are now at an end. It is
likewise some imperfect consolation to
reflect that the assassin has himself been
killed and probably by my own hand.
The shedder of blood no longer lives to
pursue his vocation, and justice is
satisfied
.
Thus have I fulfilled my promise to
compose a minute relation of my
sufferings
.
I remembered my duty to thee,
and as soon as I was able to hold a pen,
employed it to inform thee of my welfare.
I could not at that time enter into
particulars
,
but reserved a more copious
narrative till a period of more health and
leisure.
On looking back I am surprised at
the length to which my story has run. I
thought that a few days would suffice to
complete it, but one page has insensibly
been added to another till I have
consumed
,
weeks and filled volumes. Here
I will draw to a close; I will send you
what I have written, and discuss with
you in conversation, my other immediate
concerns, and my schemes for the future.
As soon as I have seen Sarsefield, I will
visit you.
FAREWELL.
E. H.
Solebury, November, 10.
TO Mr. SARSEFIELD.
Philadelphia
.
I CAME hither but ten minutes
ago, and write this letter in the bar of
the Stagehouse. I wish not to lose a
moment in informing you of what has
happened. I cannot do justice to my own
feelings when I reflect upon the rashness
of which I have been guilty.
I will give you the particulars
to-morrow
.
At present, I shall only say
that Clithero is alive, is apprised of your
wife's arrival and abode in New-York,
and has set out, with mysterious
intentions
to visit her.
May heaven avert the consequences
of such a design. May you be enabled
by some means to prevent their
meeting
.
If you cannot prevent itbut I
must not reason on such an event, nor
lengthen out this letter.
E. H.
VOL. III. P
TO THE SAME.
I WILL now relate the
particulars
which I yesterday promised to
send you. You heard through your niece
of my arrival at Inglefield's in Solebury:
My inquiries, you may readily suppose,
would turn upon the fate of my friend's
servant, Clithero, whose last
disappearance
was so strange and abrupt, and of
whom since that time, I had heard
nothing. You are indifferent to his fate
and are anxious only that his existence
and misfortunes may be speedily
forgotten
.
I confess that it is somewhat
otherwise
with me. I pity him: I wish to
relieve him, and cannot admit the belief
that his misery is without a cure. I
want to find him out? I want to know
his condition, and if possible to afford him
comfort, and inspire him with courage
and hope.
Inglefield replied to my questions.
O yes! He has appeared. The strange
being is again upon the stage. Shortly
after he left his sick bed, I heard from
Philip Beddington, of Chetasco, that
Deb's hut had found a new tenant. At
first, I imagined that the Scotsman who
built it had returned, but making closer
inquiries, I found that the new tenant
was my servant. I had no inclination to
visit him myself, but frequently
inquired
respecting him of those, who lived
or past that way, and find that he still lives
there.
But how, said I. What is his mode of
subsistance. The winter has been no
time for cultivation, and he found, I
presume
,
nothing in the ground.
Deb's hut, replied my friend, is his
lodging and his place of retirement, but
food and cloathing he procures by
labouring on a neighbouring farm. This
farm is next to that of Beddington, who
consequently knows something of his
present situation. I find little or no
difference in his present deportment; and
those appearances which he assumed,
while living with me, except that he
retires every night to his hut, and holds
as little intercourse as possible with the
rest of mankind. He dines at his
employers
table, but his supper, which is nothing
but rye-bread, he carries home with him,
and at all those times when disengaged
from employment, he secludes himself in
his hut, or wanders nobody knows
whither
.
This was the substance of Inglefield's
intelligence. I gleaned from it some
satisfaction. It proved the condition of
Clithero to be less deplorable and
desperate
than I had previously imagined. His
fatal and gloomy thoughts seemed to
have somewhat yielded to tranquillity.
In the course of my reflections,
however
,
I could not but perceive, that his
condition, though eligible when
compared
with what it once was, was likewise
disastrous and humiliating, compared
with his youthful hopes and his actual
merits. For such an one to mope away
his life in this unsocial and savage state,
was deeply to be deplored. It was my
duty, if possible, to prevail on him to
relinquish his scheme. And what would
be requisite, for that end, but to inform
him of the truth?
The source of his dejection was the
groundless belief that he had occasioned
the death of his benefactress. It was this
alone that could justly produce remorse
or grief. It was a distempered
imagination
both in him and in me, that had
P 2
given birth to this opinion, since the
terms of his narrative, impartially
considered
,
were far from implying that
catastrophe. To him, however, the
evidence
which he possessed was
incontestable
.
No deductions from probability
could overthrow his belief. This could
only be affected by similar and counter
evidence. To apprize him that she was
now alive, in possession of some degree
of happiness, the wife of Sarsefield, and
an actual resident on this shore, would
dissipate the sanguinary apparition that
haunted him; cure his diseased intellects,
and restore him to those vocations for
which his talents, and that rank in society
for which his education had qualified
him. Influenced by these thoughts, I
determined to visit his retreat. Being
obliged to leave Solebury the next day,
I resolved to set out the same afternoon,
and stopping in Chetasco, for the night,
seek his habitation at the hour when he
had probably retired to it.
This was done. I arrived at
Beddington's
,
at night-fall. My inquiries
respecting
Clithero obtained for me the same
intelligence from him, which I had
received
from Inglefield. Deb's hut was
three miles from this habitation, and
thither, when the evening had somewhat
advanced, I repaired. This was the spot
which had witnessed so many perils
during the last year, and my emotions,
on approaching it, were awful. With
palpitating heart and quick steps I
traversed
the road, skirted on each side by
thickets, and the area before the house.
The dwelling was by no means in so
ruinous a state as when I last visited it.
The crannies between the logs had been
filled up, and the light within was
perceivable
only at a crevice in the door.
Looking through this crevice I
perceived
a fire in the chimney, but the
object of my visit was no where to be
seen. I knocked and requested
admission
,
but no answer was made. At
length I lifted the latch and entered.
Nobody was there.
It was obvious to suppose that
Clithero
had gone abroad for a short time, and
would speedily return, or perhaps some
engagement had detained him at his
labour, later than usual. I therefore
seated myself on some straw near the
fire, which, with a woollen rug, appeared
to constitute his only bed. The rude
bedstead which I formerly met with, was
gone. The slender furniture, likewise,
which had then engaged my attention,
had disappeared. There was nothing
capable of human use, but a heap of
faggots in the corner, which seemed
intended
for fuel. How slender is the
accommodation which nature has
provided
for man, and how scanty is the
portion which our physical necessities
require.
While ruminating upon this scene,
and comparing past events with the
objects
before me, the dull whistling of the
gale without gave place to the sound of
foot-steps. Presently the door opened,
and Clithero entered the apartment. His
aspect and guise were not essentially
different from those which he wore when
an inhabitant of Solebury.
To find his hearth occupied by
another
,
appeared to create the deepest
surprise
.
He looked at me without any
tokens of remembrance! His features
assumed a more austere expression, and
after scowling on my person for a moment,
he withdrew his eyes, and placing in a
corner, a bundle which he bore in his
hand, he turned and seemed preparing
to withdraw.
I was anxiously attentive to his
demeanor
,
and as soon as I perceived his
purpose to depart, leaped on my feet to
prevent it. I took his hand, and
affectionately
pressing it, said, do you not
know me? Have you so soon forgotten
me who is truly your friend?
He looked at me with some attention,
but again withdrew his eyes, and placed
himself in silence on the seat which I
had left. I seated myself near him, and
a pause of mutual silence ensued.
My mind was full of the purpose that
brought me hither, but I knew not in
what manner to communicate my
purpose
.
Several times I opened my lips to
speak, but my perplexity continued, and
suitable words refused to suggest
themselves
.
At length, I said, in a confused
tone;
I came hither with a view to benefit
a man, with whose misfortunes his own
lips have made me acquainted, and who
has awakened in my breast the deepest
sympathy. I know the cause and
extent
of his dejection. I know the event
which has given birth to horror and
remorse
in his heart. He believes that,
by his means, his patroness and
benefactress
has found an untimely death.
These words produced a visible
shock in my companion, which evinced
that I had at least engaged his attention.
I proceeded:
This unhappy lady was cursed with
a wicked and unnatural brother. She
conceived a disproportionate affection for
this brother, and erroneously imagined
that her fate was blended with his; that
their lives would necessarily terminate at
the same period, and that therefore,
whoever
was the contriver of his death, was
likewise, by a fatal and invincible
necessity
,
the author of her own.
Clithero was her servant, but was
raised by her bounty, to the station of
her son and the rank of her friend.
Clithero, in self-defence took away the
life of that
unnatural
brother, and, in that
deed, falsely but cogently believed, that
he had perpetrated the destruction of his
benefactress.
To ascertain the truth, he sought
her presence. She was found, the tidings
of her brother's death were
communicated
,
and she sunk breathless at his
feet.
At these words Clithero started from
the ground, and cast upon me looks of
furious indignationAnd come you
hither, he muttered, for this end; to
recount
my offences, and drive me again
to despair?
No, answered I, with quickness, I
come to out-root a fatal, but powerful
illusion. I come to assure you that the
woman, with whose destruction you
charge yourself, is
not dead
.
These words, uttered with the most
emphatical solemnity, merely produced
looks in which contempt was mingled
with anger. He continued silent.
I perceive, resumed I, that my words
are disregarded. Would to Heaven I
were able to conquer your incredulity,
could shew you not only the truth, but
the probability of my tale. Can you not
confide in me? that Euphemia Lorimer
is now alive, is happy, is the wife of
Sarsefield; that her brother is forgotten
and his murderer regarded without
enmity
or vengeance?
He looked at me with a strange
expression
of contemptCome, said he, at
length, make out thy assertion to be true.
Fall on thy knees and invoke the
thunder
of heaven to light on thy head if
thy words be false. Swear that
Euphemia
Lorimer is alive; happy; forgetful of
Wiatte and compassionate of me Swear
that thou hast seen her; talked with her;
received from her own lips the confession
of her pity for him who aimed a dagger
VOL. III. Q
at her bosom. Swear that she is
Sarsefield's
wife.
I put my hands together, and lifting
my eyes to heaven, exclaimed: I
comply
with your conditions; I call the
omniscient God to witness that Euphemia
Lorimer is alive; that I have seen her
with these eyes; have talked with her;
have inhabited the same house for
months.
These asseverations were listened to
with shuddering. He laid not aside,
however, an air of incredulity and
contempt
.
Perhaps, said he, thou canst
point out the place of her abode. Canst
guide me to the city, the street, the very
door of her habitation?
I can. She rises at this moment in
the city of New-York; in Broadway; in
an house contiguous to the...
'Tis well, exclaimed my companion,
in a tone, loud, abrupt, and in the utmost
degree, vehement. 'Tis well. Rash
and infatuated youth. Thou hast
ratified
,
beyond appeal or forgiveness, thy
own doom. Thou hast once more let
loose my steps, and sent me on a fearful
journey. Thou hast furnished the means
of detecting thy imposture. I will fly to
the spot which thou describest. I will
ascertain thy falsehood with my own
eyes. If she be alive then am I reserved
for the performance of a new crime.
My evil destiny will have it so. If she
be dead, I shall make
thee
expiate.
So saying, he darted through the
door, and was gone in a moment, beyond
my sight and my reach. I ran to the
road, looked on every side, and called;
but my calls were repeated in vain.
He had fled with the swiftness of a deer.
My own embarrassment, confusion
and terror were enexpressible. His last
words were incoherent. They denoted
the tumult and vehemence of phrenzy.
They intimated his resolution to seek the
presence of your wife. I had furnished a
clue, which could not fail to conduct him
to her presence. What might not be
dreaded from the interview? Clithero is
a maniac. This truth cannot be
concealed
.
Your wife can with difficulty
preserve her tranquillity, when his image
occurs to her remembrance. What
must it be when he starts up before her
in his neglected and ferocious guise, and
armed with purposes, perhaps as terrible
as those, which had formerly led him to
her secret chamber, and her bed side?
His meaning was obscurely
conveyed
.
He talked of a deed, for the
performance of which, his malignant
fate had reserved him; which was to
ensue their meeting, and which was to
afford disastrous testimony of the
infatuation
which had led me hither.
Heaven grant that some means may
suggest themselves to you of intercepting
his approach. Yet I know not what
means can be conceived. Some
miraculous
chance may befriend you; yet this
is scarcely to be hoped. It is a
visionary
and fantastic base on which to rest
our security.
I cannot forget that my unfortunate
temerity has created this evil. Yet who
could foresee this consequence of my
intelligence. I imagined, that Clithero
was merely a victim of erroneous
gratitude
,
a slave of the errors of his
education
,
and the prejudices of his rank, that
his understanding was deluded by
phantoms
in the mask of virtue and duty, and
not as you have strenuously maintained,
utterly subverted.
I shall not escape your censure, but
I shall, likewise, gain your compassion.
I have erred, not through sinister or
malignant intentions, but from the
impulse
of misguided, indeed, but powerful
benevolence.
E. H.
Q 2
TO EDGAR HUNTLY.
New-York
.
Edgar,
After
the fatigues of the day,
I returned home. As I entered, my
wife was breaking the seal of a letter,
but, on seeing me, she forbore and
presented
the letter to me.
I saw, said she, by the superscription
of this letter, who the writer was. So
agreeably to your wishes, I proceeded to
open it, but you have come just time
enough to save me the trouble.
This letter was from you. It
contained
information relative to Clithero.
See how imminent a chance it was that
saved my wife from a knowledge of its
contents. It required all my efforts to
hide my perturbation from her, and
excuse myself from shewing her the
letter.
I know better than you the character
of Clithero, and the consequences of a
meeting between him and my wife. You
may be sure that I would exert myself
to prevent a meeting.
The method for me to pursue was
extremely obvious. Clithero is a
madman
whose liberty is dangerous, and who
requires to be fettered and imprisoned as
the most atrocious criminal.
I hastened to the chief Magistrate,
who is my friend, and by proper
representations
,
obtained from him authority
to seize Clithero wherever I should meet
with him, and effectually debar him from
the perpetration of new mischiefs.
New-York does not afford a place of
confinement for lunatics, as suitable to
his case, as Pennsylvania. I was
desirous
of placing him as far as possible
from the place of my wife's residence.
Fortunately there was a packet for
Philadelphia, on the point of setting out
on her voyage. This vessel I engaged
to wait a day or two, for the purpose of
conveying him to the Pennsylvania
hospital
.
Meanwhile, proper persons were
stationed at Powels-hook, and at the
quays where the various stageboats from
Jersey arrive.
These precautions were effectual.
Not many hours after the receipt of your
intelligence, this unfortunate man applied
for a passage at Elizabeth-town, was
seized the moment he set his foot on
shore, and was forthwith conveyed to
the packet, which immediately set sail.
I designed that all these proceedings
should be concealed from the women, but
unfortunately neglected to take suitable
measures for hindering the letter which
you gave me reason to expect on the
ensuing day, from coming into their
hands. It was delivered to my wife in
my absence and opened immediately by
her.
You know what is, at present, her
personal condition. You know what
strong reasons I had to prevent any
danger
or alarm from approaching her.
Terror
could not assume a shape, more
ghastly than this. The effects have been
what might have been easily predicted.
Her own life has been imminently
endangered
and an untimely birth, has blasted
my fondest hope. Her infant, with whose
future existence so many pleasures were
entwined,
is dead
.
I assure you Edgar, my philosophy
has not found itself lightsome and active
under this burden. I find it hard to
forbear commenting on your rashness in
no very mild terms. You acted in direct
opposition to my council, and to the
plainest dictates of propriety. Be more
circumspect and more obsequious for the
future.
You knew the liberty that would be
taken of opening my letters; you knew
of my absence from home, during the
greatest part of the day, and the
likelihood
therefore that your letters would
fall into my wife's hands before they
came into mine. These considerations
should have prompted you to send them
under cover to Whitworth or Harvey,
with directions to give them immediately
to
me
.
Some of these events happened in my
absence, for I determined to accompany
the packet myself and see the madman
safely delivered to the care of the
hospital
.
I will not torture your sensibility by
recounting the incidents of his arrest and
detention. You will imagine that his
strong, but perverted reason exclaimed
loudly against the injustice of his
treatment
.
It was easy for him to outreason
his antagonist, and nothing but force
could subdue his opposition. On me
devolved the province of his jailor and
his tyrant; a province which
required
an heart more steeled by spectacles
of suffering and the exercise of cruelty,
than mine had been.
Scarcely had we passed
The
Narrows
,
when the lunatic, being suffered
to walk the deck, as no apprehensions
were entertained of his escape in such
circumstances, threw himself overboard,
with a seeming intention to gain the
shore. The boat was immediately
manned
,
the fugitive was pursued, but at the
moment, when his flight was overtaken,
he forced himself beneath the surface,
and was seen no more.
With the life of this wretch, let our
regrets and our forebodings terminate.
He has saved himself from evils, for
which no time would have provided a
remedy, from lingering for years in the
noisome dungeon of an hospital.
Having
no reason to continue my voyage, I
put myself on board a coasting sloop,
and regained this city in a few hours.
I persuade myself that my wife's
indisposition
will be temporary. It was
impossible
to hide from her the death of
Clithero, and its circumstances. May
this be the last arrow in the quiver of
adversity! Farewell.
END.
DEATH OF CICERO,
A FRAGMENT.
DEATH OF CICERO,
A FRAGMENT.
TIRO TO ATTICUS.
The
task of relating the last
events in the life of my beloved master,
has fallen upon me. His last words
reminded me of the obligation, which I
had long since assumed, of conveying
to his Atticus a faithful account of his
death. Having performed this task, life
will cease to be any longer of value.
Having parted with his brother, he
went on board a vessel which lay at
anchor
in the road. The master was a
Cyprian, ignorant of the Roman
language
;
a stupid and illiterate sailor,
whose provincial jargon was luckily
understood
and spoken by
Chlorus,
who was
by birth a Cnidian. He served us as
interpreter
.
He was a stranger to the affairs of
Italy, and his knowledge was so
extremely
limited, that he had never heard even
the name of my master. This ignorance
we were careful not to remove; and
finding
him unengaged, and merely waiting
till some one should offer him a cargo,
I tendered him a large sum if he would
set sail immediately. This incident
determined
our course. No great deviation
from his usual route was necessary to
carry us to Tarsus, and there my
master would not only be under the
protection
of Cassius, but in the midst of his
Cilician clients. His ancient subjects
would not fail to receive, with joy and
VOL. III. R 2
gratitude, a patron from whom they had
received so many benefits, and in case of
any adverse fortune, their mountains
would afford him concealment and
security
.
The vessel was small and crazy. It
afforded wretched accommodation, but
it behoved us to submit to every
inconvenience
,
and to console ourselves with
the hope that the voyage would be
short. We had scarcely got on board,
however, and made our bargain with the
master when the wind, which had lately
been propitious, changed to the
southeast
,
and with this wind, the master
declared it impossible to move from our
present station.
This was an untoward event. Our
safety depended upon the expedition
with which we should fly from the shores
of Italy. Our foot-steps would be
diligently
traced, and another hour might
bring the blood-hounds within view.
One expedient was obvious. The
search might be eluded, or, at least
prolonged
,
by leaving this spot. It was
possible to move by the help of oars
along the coast. Further south, the
country near the sea was still more
desolate
and woody than here, and we
might be concealed in some obscure and
unfrequented bay, till the wind should
once more become favourable.
Additional rewards and promises
induced
the captain to adopt this scheme.
The wind and the turbulence of the
waves increased. My master had always
an antipathy to voyages by sea, owing,
probably, to the deadly sickness, with
which the tossing of the billows never
failed to afflict him. This sickness
speedily
came on, and added to the pent-up
air, filthiness and inconvenience of the
ship, plunged him into new impatience
and dejection. He frequently declared
his resolution to go on shore, and offer
to his enemies a life which was a burden
to him, and relinquished his design not
till I had employed the most pathetic
and vehement remonstrances.
We had not gone two leagues before
night came on. This for a time
suspended
our toils. We came to anchor
near the shore, and being somewhat
sheltered from the wind, by the
direction
of the shore, the sea became more
calm, and my master's sickness
disappeared
.
Still he was unwilling to pass the
night on board the vessel, and ordered
us to land.
This proceeding was imminently
dangerous. I endeavoured to convince
him of this danger. The town of
Circ
um
was two or three miles distant,
but the huts of which it consited would
afford him accommodation little better
than that which the ship afforded. He
would unavoidably be recognized by the
inhabitants, and if they had not yet
heard of the proscription, his appearance
among them would lead them to suspect
the truth, and what reliance could be
placed upon their fidelity? This town
might contain some tenant or retainer
of Csar, or it might at this moment be
visited by the messengers of Anthony,
at least, his appearance there would
shortly be known, and would afford to
his pursuers a new clue, by which they
may be aided in their search. The same
hazards would accompany his entrance
into any of the neighbouring
farmhouses
.
These reasonings made him give up
his resolution of going to Circum, but
he retained his determination to land. If
he should pass the night in the open air,
though the ground was covered with
snow, it was better than to breathe the
poisonous atmosphere of the ship, and
remain cooped up with the Cyprian and
his crew.
Since he would not give up this
design, I endeavoured to find reasons
for approving it. One danger against
which it was needful to provide, was the
suspicion of the sailors. The grief and
dejection of my master, our impatience
to be gone from Italy, and the secret and
abrupt manner of our embarkation, could
not but excite their notice and make them
busy at conjecture. They would be still
more at a loss to conceive why, when a
town was so near, we should prefer to
spend the night on board their vessel, and
the shelter of a tree or a rock, with the
fire which might easily be kindled, were,
in truth, not less safe or commodious
than continuance in the ship.
Preparations
,
were, therefore, made to land.
My caution led me to go on shore
before him, that any danger which
impended
might be seasonably descried.
Wandering over the strand, a small hut
was discovered which appeared to have
been formerly inhabited by fishermen.
This was a season when the net was
idle, and this hut was therefore deserted.
The walls and roof were broken, but a
good fire might render it tenable for a
few hours. Here my master consented
to repose himself.
The ground within the hut, as well
as without, was covered with snow.
This was removed and a kind of bed
of withered sticks and dried leaves was
provided for him. On this he lay
down, and the servants seated
themselves
around him. He did not
endeavour
to sleep, but supporting his head
upon his elbow, and fixing his eyes, in
a thoughtful mood, upon the fire, he
delivered himself up to meditation. A
pause of general and mournful silence
ensued.
Every one's eyes were fixed upon
those venerable features. To behold
one, so illustrious, one that had so lately
governed the destinies of mankind, seated
on the pinnacle of human greatness, and
encompassed with all the goods of
fortune
,
thus reduced to the condition of a
fugitive and out-law, stretched upon the
bare earth, in this wretched hovel,
affected
all of us alike. Every bosom seemed
to swell with the same sentiment, and
required the relief of tears. Chlorus set
us the example of this weakness, and not
one of us but sobbed aloud.
His attention was recalled by this
sound. He lifted his head, and looked
upon us by turns with an air of
inexpressible
benignity. My friends, said he, at
length, be not discomposed. My life has
been sufficiently long, since I have lived
to reap the rewards of virtue. Those
evils must indeed be great, which would
not be compensated by these proofs of
your affection. I need extort from you
no other testimony of the equity and
kindness of my treatment of you, than
the fidelity and tenderness with which
you have adhered to me in my distress.
This is a consolation of which it is not
in the power of the tyrants to bereave
me. Let their executioners come: I am
willing to die.
These words only heightened the
emotions which they were intended to
suppress. I desired for my own sake,
to change or to terminate this scene, and
to reflect that my duty forbade me to sit
here in inactivity, when surrounded by
so many dangers. None of us had eaten
VOL. III. S
a morsel since we left Astura. Our
master was too much absorbed in
reflections
connected with his fallen fortunes,
to think of food. It was our duty to
contend
with his indifference or aversion, in
this respect, as well as to supply our
exhausted
strength, and prepare for the
hardships which we were yet to endure.
I determined, therefore, to go, with
two or three companions, to Circum
and purchase necessaries, as well as
ascertain
what danger was to be dreaded
from this quarter. My master was
careless
of necessity or danger, and the task
of consulting and deciding for the
welfare
of himself and his servants, had
entirely devolved upon me. This charge,
it behoved me to perform with
circumspection
and zeal.
We set out, and crossing an angle of
the forest, quickly reached the village.
The utmost caution was necessary to be
used, since many of the servants of
Cicero, and particularly myself, were
nearly as well known, especially in this
district, as our lord. Chlorus was least
liable to be detected, in consequence of
having spent the greater part of his life
at the Cuman Villa. He might be
effectually
disguised, likewise, by mimicking
the accents of a Cyprian sailor, and
pretending
that he came from the vessel.
Chlorus went forward, while I and Sura
remained at a distance, awaiting his
return
.
He came back in a short time,
and with some tokens of alarm. He had
crept into a tavern, and after purchasing
some bread and dried fruits, had joined
a knot of persons who were earnestly
engaged in conversation in the portico.
One appeared to be a stranger, who had
just arrived, and was telling his news to
the rest. The coalition of the tyrants was
the theme of his discourse. Pdius, the
consul, was said to be included in the
sentence of proscription, and a tumult
was affirmed to have been raised, on this
account, in the city. The populace had
aided the magistrate in arresting the
emisaries
from the armies, and the senate
had created Pdius dictator.
After listening some time, Chlorus
ventured to slide into the company, and
inquired, in his broken Latin, of what
proscription they were talking. The
traveller repeated his news with great
vivacity, and mentioned, among a
thousand
incredible circumstances, that the
army of Brutus had revolted, and that
diligent search was making for the
Ciceros
.
He had just passed near Astura,
and was told that a troop had been there,
hunting for the fugitives, and finding
them to have lately fled, they had
dispersed
themselves over the country, and
he was sure they could not escape.
Hearing this, Chlorus withdrew, and
hastened to communicate his tidings
to me.
The revolt of the Macedonian army
was sufficiently probable. This was
mournful news, but it shewed with new
force the propriety of taking refuge in
Asia, rather than in Greece. The last
tale was noless probable, and convinced
us that no time was to be lost in leaving
this fatal shore.
To leave it, however, was not in our
power. The present state of the wind
imprisoned us in this spot. To change
it for another would merely multiply our
perils. Here we must remain till it should
please Jove to give us a prosperous gale,
or till our enemies should trace us to our
covert. It only remained for us to hasten
back to the hut, and defend our master
at the expense of our own lives.
S 2
We returned. No interruption or
intrusion had been experienced during
our absence. On entering the hovel, I
found my master in profound sleep.
His features were tranquil and placid,
and his anxieties were, for a while,
entirely
forgotten. The bread and fruits we
had brought were shared among our
companions, and we continued to watch
during the night.
Anxious attention was paid to the
state of the air, and fruitless wishes and
repinings were whispered by one to
another. The morning light returned.
The enemy was still distant, but the sky
was as untoward as ever.
At length, my master awoke of his
own accord. After noticing the day-light,
and recollecting his situation, he turned
to me, and said: Well, my dear Tiro,
what is now to be done? I will tell thee
what; we will go on board; the Cyprian
shall ply his oars and carry us to Formia,
and there will I wait for my release.
He noticed the down-cast eyes and
mournful looks, which these words
occasioned
.
No one seemed inclined to
move to such a purpose. He looked
around him, and continued in the same
tone; What else, my friends, would you
purpose to be done? How unworthy of
the saviour of Rome and of Italy is it to
be thus clinging to a wretched life, and
skulking from ungrateful foes, among
rocks and woods? No: I have done
my part: All that remains is to die with
firmness and with dignity.
Hitherto, I have been the fool of
passion and inconstancy. My purposes
have wavered from day to day, but it is
time to shake off this irresolution and
trample on this cowardice. I am now
resolved, and will be gone to Formia this
moment.
With these words he rose from the
ground, and put on an air of sternness
and command, which left me no power
to expostulate. We obeyed him in
silence, and once more put ourselves on
board the vessel. The crew were still
asleep, but being roused by our arrival,
were prevailed upon to row along the
shore towards Formia.
My master seemed to have retreived
his wonted tranquillity, in consequence
of having formed his ultimate resolution.
He was still, for the most part, wrapt in
meditation. He forebore to converse
with me, but sat upon the deck, with his
eyes fixed upon the water, which was
now less turbulent than on the former
day, and did not occasion sickness.
My own thoughts were occupied in
devising some means of escape. We
were now approaching Sicily, and it was
possible that some conveyance could be
gained to that island. This however
must be found after our arrival at Formia,
for beyond this the Cyprian refused to
go, under pretence, which indeed, was
probably true, of being unacquainted
with the coast. Neither was I totally
without hope that the wind would
suddenly
change, and permit us to leave the
coast. On this event, I did not fear
to obtain Cicero's concurrence, with a
scheme so conducive to his safety. To
despair of himself or the republic while
the seas were open, and while Cassius
was in arms, and furnished with the
wealth of all the Asiatic provinces, was
unworthy of his understanding and his
virtue.
His purpose to go to any one of his
villas was pregnant with danger. These
places would be searched, by his
enemies
.
As long as he remained in Italy,
it was expedient to conceal himself in
unsuspected corners. Could not such
be found, where he might remain
unmolested
for years.
I now reflected that Formia being
situated within a mile of the sea, might
be the best asylum to which he could
betake himself. A ship might be
provided
,
ready to profit by the first wind,
to sail away to Sicily, while, in the
mean time, my master might be
effectually
secreted in some part of his
dominion
.
The subterranean vaults,
constructed
to preserve wine and other provisions,
on this estate, might afford him
concealment
till the opportunity of escape should
offer.
While brooding over these images,
we came in sight of Formia. It was
now time to mention to him this sceme.
He received it with disapprobationI
am too old, said he, to undergo once
more the hardships and hazards of a
camp. I have witnessed long enough the
ingratitude and perfidy of mankind. I
am tired of the spectacle, and am
determined
to close my eyes upon it forever.
It shall never be said, that Marcus
Cicero fled from the presence of tyrants,
that he saved the miserable remnant of
his old age, by making himself an exile
from his country. I tell thee, Tiro, I
am too old to become the sport of fortune,
and the follower of armies. Cassius and
Brutus are young, they are innured to
war; it is their element. They fight for
liberty and glory, which their age will
permit them to enjoy for many years to
come; but as to me, I have reached the
verge of the grave already, and should I
elude my enemies, and reach Rhodes or
Tarsus in safety, I should only have
reserved myself for a speedy and ignoble
death. No: Here shall be the end of
my wanderings.
I will go to my house. I will pass
my time without anxiety or fear. When
the executioners of Antony arrive, they
will find their victim prepared. My
resolution continued he, with some
impatience
,
is taken. It is to no purpose to
harass me with arguments and
remonstrances
,
for I shall never swerve from
it.
I was not totally
discouraged
by these
declarations. I confided in my power to
vanquish this resolution, as soon as the
means of escape should be provided.
Till then it was indeed useless to
contend
with his despair. His imagination
saw nothing but cowardice and
degradation
,
in hiding himself in vaults and
pits. That he who was so long at the
head of the Roman state, should seek
his safety in shifts and stratagems like
these, was ignominious and detestable.
Death was not so terrible that it should
be shunned, life was not so dear that it
should be preserved at this price.
He proceeded to his house with an
air of fearlessness and confidence. It was
far from certain, that it was not occupied
already by assassins, expecting and
waiting his approach; of this, however,
he testified no apprehension. As soon
as he entered the porch, his arrival was
rumoured through the building, and his
servants hurried from all quarters to
welcome him. Their looks betrayed
anxiety as well as joy. It was easy to
perceive that they were not unapprised
of the dangers which encompassed their
master, and that his appearance among
them had been unexpected. He greeted
and smiled upon each, and then
retired
to his chamber, whither he would
not allow any one to follow him.
VOL. III. T
It was now time to adopt those
measures
on which my thoughts had been
engaged. As soon as I parted from my
master, I took Glauco the steward aside.
I told him what had lately happened,
and what I now designed to do, and
desired
his assistance to procure a vessel
which might carry us without delay to
Sicily.
I found that there was need of the
utmost expedition, for Glauco informed
me that, not many hours before, a troop
of twenty horse-men, had come hither.
They rode furiously into the court, and
without inquiry or permission, rushed
into the house. They entered every
apartment, and not finding their victim,
indulged their resentment in
imprecations
on the upstart of Arpinum, and in
striking their swords against the
furniture
and pictures. Two busts, of
Brutus and Ahala, which stood in the
library, they overturned upon the
pavement
.
The servants, affrighted at the stern
and sullen visages of these intruders,
fled from their presence. After
lingering
for some time in the house, they
mounted their horses and disappeared.
These tidings shewed me the
magnitude
and nearness of the danger. Not
a moment should be wasted in
deliberation
or uncertainty. It was possible that
the assassins might not speedily return,
and the interval was to be employed in
procuring the means of flight. The sea
was to be crossed, and Cajeta was a
league distant. At Cajeta only was it
possible to find a vessel, suited to our
purpose.
I now called some of the most
faithful
servants together, and charged them
to guard the safety of their master, till
Glauco and I should return, which
should be in less than an hour. We
were going, I told them, to Cajeta, in
hopes of finding some immediate
conveyance
from this shore, and would return
with the utmost expedition.
We set out, selecting the fleetest
horses to carry us. Three barks were
seen in the bay, Glauco imagined that
he saw on one the stern and beak which
is peculiar to Sicily. To this we
immediately
transported ourselves. Happily
his penetration had not been deceived,
and the Sicilian readily consented to take
us on board, and proceed immediately
to Sicily.
By exerting themselves with energy,
they might bring the vessel in a short
time to the shore nearest to my master's
house. This was better than to bring
him to Cajeta, where it would be
impossible
for him to escape observation, and
to which he could come only by a
public
road, thronged and obstructed with
passengers.
I left Glauco on board the vessel, to
hasten the motions of the sailors and to
direct them to the proper place.
Meanwhile
,
I mounted my horse and rode
back to Formia. The vessel would be
ready to receive us by the time that we
should reach the shore.
The domestics, whom I had posted
in the atrium, were still assembled and
received me with joy, but one event had
taken place in my absence which filled
me with foreboding and anxiety. A
slave who wrought in the fields, who
formerly belonged to the Cornelian
family, and whose temper was
remarkably
perverse and malignant, had
withdrawn
himself immediately after my
master's arrival. Glauco had frequently
complained of the turbulent and
worthless
character of this slave, and had
exhorted
Cicero to part with him. In the
multiplicity of more momentous concerns
this affair had been overlooked by my
T 2
master, and he still continued in the
family.
It was now suggested to me that he
had gone in order to recall the soldiers,
and to avenge himself in this manner,
for the punishments which his refractory
and rebellious conduct had frequently
incurred. This new danger was an
additional
incitement to my diligence. I
went to my master's chamber and found
him asleep. This was no time to be
scrupulous or tardy. I awakened him.
On recovering his recollection, and
finding me beside him, with every mark
of trepidation and dismay, and silent,
from my uncertainty in what manner to
address him, he suspected that I brought
fatal tidings. He looked at me without
emotion, and said:
How is it with thee, my Tiro? With
me, all is well. I have slept soundly,
and am prepared to meet the worst. Thou
wouldst tell me that they are coming.
I rejoice to hear it: the sooner they
arrive and execute the will of Anthony
and his Octavius, the better.
Saying this, he half rose from the
couch, and stretching his feet towards the
stove, he continued: Thanks to Jove,
that, at a time like this, nothing but my
feet are cold. I have done with hope
and with fear, and Csar's ministers shall
find that my heart's blood has lost none
of its warmth. He may deface and
mangle
this frame, but my spirit shall be
found invincible.
I could no longer forbear, but while
the tears flowed down my cheeks, I
pulled him by the arm towards the door,
and exclaimed: We have found a
vessel
that will carry us to Sicily. She lies
at this moment near the shore ready to
receive us. Hasten, I beseech you,
beyond
the reach of the tyrants. Why
would you glut the vengeance of
Anthony
,
and not rather live to raise up the
republic?
He shook his head, and resisting my
efforts: It is too late, said he: I never
can die in a fitter season and place than
the present, and hence I will not move.
O! Heaven! Does Cicero love his
enemies better than his friends? Is he
willing to sacrifice his country to parricides
and traitors? Shall he seek death because,
while he lives, liberty is not extinguished;
because the triumph of the wicked can
only be completed by his death?
Has Antony merited so well at your
hands, that you are willing to die, that
his ambition may be fully gratified? Is
this the issue of your warfare? After
contending
with his treason so long, do you
now fall of your own accord at his feet,
put the poniard in his hand and call upon
him to strike? Thus will mankind regard
your conduct when the means of escape
are offered you, when the arms and
treasures
of Sicily and Greece and Asia are
ready to be put into your hand, you reject
the gift, you abandon the cause of your
country, of liberty, of your friends;
you invite infamous assassins to your
bosom; you die at the moment when your
life is of most value to mankind, and
nothing but your death is wanting to
ensure the destruction of Rome.
O! let it not be said that in his last
hours, Marcus Cicero was a recreant
and coward. That so illustrious a life
was closed with infamy, that his eulogies
on liberty, his efforts for the salvation of
Rome, the claims of gratitude and
friendship
were forgotten or despised. That
mankind called on their deliverer, that
armies and provinces were offered to be
employed by him in the rescue of his
country, and the ruin of tyrants, in vain.
The road is open and direct, there is
nothing to create momentary hindrance
or delay. In a few hours, he may laugh
at the impotent resentment of Antony;
and arm himself to punish the ingratitude
and perfidy of CsarBut no, he will
thrust himself within their grasp; he will
patiently wait till their assassins have
leisure to execute their sentence; he will
beg them to except his homage, and
since his death is indispensable to their
success, he will stretch out his neck to
receive it.
Perceiving that my master's
resolution
began to faulter. I redoubled my
remonstrances, I called up the images of
his brother, his son and his nephew, of
Cassius and Brutus and Pompeius. I
painted the effect which the tidings of
his death would produce in them; their
transports of grief awakened not so much
by the injury redounding to the common
cause, as by the infatuation and folly to
which his death must be ascribed. With
their humiliation and terror, I contrasted
the exultation of his enemies, to whose
malice he was thus making himself a
voluntary
victim. What indignities would
not be heaped upon his lifeless remains!
How would Fulvia and Anthony feast
their eyes upon his head, which, torn
from the trunk, will be carried to their
toilets, and how will the folly of inviting
their revenge and crouching to the stroke
of their assassins be made the endless
theme of ridicule and mockery?
At this moment, the servants entered
the chamber with a litter. I had given
previous directions to this effect. I had
resolved if persuasion should prove
inefficacious
,
to carry him away by force.
One of the bearers was Chlorus, whose
looks betokened the deepest
consternation
,
and by his eyes and gestures
besought
me to use dispatch. I made a
sign to the attendants, who approached
their master with diffidence and
reverence
and prepared to remove him from
his couch to the litter.
I renewed my supplications and
remonstrances
,
to which he listened in
silence, and though his looks testified
reluctance and perplexity, he made no
resistance. He was placed in the litter.
I led the way into the garden. Chlorus
had now an opportunity to whisper me
that the soldiers had scented their prey
anew and were hastening to the house.
This intelligence induced me to strike
into an obscure path which led through
a wood and to quicken the pace of my
companions.
The litter was surrounded by sixteen
domestics well armed. They were all
faithful to their trust. Most of them
were grey with age, but vigorous and
resolute. All of them had been, during
many years, personal attendants on their
lord, and were eager to shed their blood
in his defence; I was not without hope
that should we be overtaken and
attacked
,
such resistance might be made,
as, at least, to secure the retreat of my
master to the shore.
We had now accomplished half the
journey, and were inspired with new
confidence
in our good fortune. Turning
an angle, however, a band of men
appeared
in sight. They discovered us in
a moment, and shouting aloud, made
towards us with the utmost expedition.
There was now room but for one choice.
Fly, said I, to those that bore the litter,
fly with your burden to the shore and
leave us to contend with these
miscreants
.
The enemy had been discovered by
my master as soon as by us. He now
raised himself up, and exclaimed in a
tone of irresistable authority; No: I
charge you stir not a step. Set down
the litter and await their coming. Put
up your swords, continued he, turning
to the rest, who had, in imitation of my
example unsheathed their weapons: Put
VOL. III. U
up your swords. By the duty which you
owe me, I command you to forbear.
With whatever sternness these
commands
were delivered, they would not
have made me hesitate or faulter. I was
prepared to conduct myself, not
agreeable
to his directions, but to the
exigencies
of the time; I was willing to
preserve
his life even at the hazard of
offending him beyond forgiveness; but
my companions were endowed with less
firmness.
Go on, said I, to the bearers, heed
not the words of a desperate man. It is
your duty to save him, though you
forfeit
your lives by your disobedience
They once more stooped to raise up the
vehicle, but were again forbidden. What!
said he, am I fallen so low as to be
trampled
on by slaves? Desist, this moment!
Appalled and confounded by the energy
of his accents, they let fall the litter, and
stood with their eyes down-cast and
motionless.
The delay which this altercation
produced
,
rendered his escape impossible.
The veteran and well-accoutred band
that was approaching, left us no hope
of victory. All that I had meditated,
was to retard their progress so long that
my master might reach the ship in safety.
For this end, we were to lay down our
own lives, but as long as he continued
in this spot all opposition would be
fruitless
.
To stay and behold violence
committed
on that venerable head was not
in my power. I went forward to meet
the assassins. It was not, however, till
I had discerned the person of their leader
that I had any hopes of diverting them
from their design. He was a tribune in
the army of Csar, and his name was
Popilius Lnas.
This man had been formerly accused
of murdering his wife's brother. This
brother had considerable property to
which Lnas expected to succeed, but
on some dissention between them, the
brother had selected a new heir and
Lnas was said to have gratified his
vengeance by his death. His wife and
children were among his accusers, and
there was too much reason to believe
the truth of the accusation.
In this extremity he besought Cicero
to be his advocate. Lnas had been
active in the Clodian tumults, had sided
with Milo and the Senate, and had,
consequently
,
promoted the interests of my
master. This service was now his plea,
and, joined with unwearied
importunities
,
accomplished his end. Cicero was
an enthusiast in gratitude, and was not
used to scrutinize suspiciously or weigh
accurately, this kind of merit. Benefits
received from others were, if possible,
repaid an hundred fold. He made
himself
the advocate of a cause, which,
without his assistance, would doubtless
have been desperate, and Lnas was
acquitted. His vows of gratitude and
service were unbounded, and now that
I discovered him at the head of Csar's
executioners was scarcely credible.
After a moments pause, I advanced
towards him, and offered him my hand.
He rejected it with scorn and rage, and
thrusting me aside, Out of the way,
villain, said he, and thank my mercy
that you do not share the fate of the
traitor
you serve.
His followers surrounded me with
drawn swords, and looking at the tribune,
seemed to wait only for his signal to put
me to death. Come on, he cried; Our
prize is in view. Cut down every one
that opposes, but leave the peacable
alone. They left me and hastened
towards
the litter.
U 2
My eyes followed them instinctively.
Shuddering and a cold dew invaded my
limbs. With the life of Cicero,
methought
,
was entwined the existence of
Rome. The stroke by which one was
severed, would be no less fatal to the
other. It was indeed true that liberty
would he extinguished by his death, and
then only would commence the reign of
Anthony, and the servitude of mankind.
Would no effort avail to turn aside
the stroke? Should I stand a powerless
spectator of the deed? Might I not save
myself at least the ignominy and horror of
witnessing the fall of my master, by
attacking his assassins or falling on my
own sword?
These impulses of grief, were
repressed
by the remembrance of the
duties, which his death would leave to
be performed by me and of the promises
by which I was bound.
During these thoughts my eyes were
fixed upon the litter. My master,
perceiving
the approach of the tribune, held
forth his head, as if to facilitate the
assassin's
office. His posture afforded a
distinct
view of his countenance, which
was more thoughtful and serene than I
had seen it during our flight from...
The eyes of the ruffians sparkled
with joy at sight of their victim. They
contended which should be foremost in
guilt. The domestics, struck with
consternation
,
looked upon each other in
silence. The soldiers, full of eagerness
to secure the reward which Anthony had
promised for the head of his enemy,
were too much occupied to speak to each
other, or to heed any foreign object.
One blow severed the devoted head!
No sooner had it fallen, than the troop
set up an horrid shout of exultation.
Lnas grasped the hain and threw the
head into a large bag, held open by one
of his companions for that purpose.
Come, lads, he cried: Post we, with
our prize, with all speed to Rome?
Anthony
will pay us well for this service
So saying, they hastened away with as
much expedition as they came.
All passed in a moment. Nothing
but the headless trunk, stretched upon
the floor of the litter, which floated in
blood, remained. I approached the
vehicle
without being fully conscious of my
movements, and gazed upon the
mutilated
figure. My thoughts were at a
stand, as well as my power of utterance
suspended. My heart seemed too small
to embrace the magnitude of this
calamity
.
It was not a single man who had
fallen, or whose violent catastrophe was
the theme of everlasting regret. The
light of the world was extinguished, and
the hopes of human kind brought to an
end.
My mind gradually recovered some
degree of activity. I mused upon the
events that led to this disaster. It
seemed
as if the most flagitious folly, had
given birth to this insupportable evil.
Nothing was easier than to have fled to
the shore; to have embarked in the Sicilian
vessel, and quickly to have moved
ourselves
beyond the reach of our enemies.
At one time, I loaded myself with the
most vehement upbraidings: Why did I
not exert myself to hinder him from
leaving
the Cyprian barque? Had we
proceeded
to Cajeta, without delay, we might
have put ourselves on board the
Agrigentine
,
and set danger at defiance. The
Cyprian refused to proceed, but menaces
would have been successful where
rewards
had failed. He and his feeble
crew, would have easily been mastered
by our superior number.
But was not Cicero himself the author
of his evil destiny? Irresolute,
desponding
or perverse, he thwarted or
frustrated
the measures conducive to his safety.
More sensible to the stings of ingratitude
and his personal humiliation, than to the
claims of his fellow citizens; prone to
despair of liberty, though the richest
and most populous portion of the empire
was still faithful to its cause; though
veteran armies and illustrious officers
were still ranged under its banners in
Sicily, Greece and Asia, he lingered on
this fatal shore, and threw himself before
the executioner.
There were a thousand recesses on
this desolate coast, and caverns in the
Apenine
, and unsuspected retreats on his
own estate, where he might have been
effectually concealed, till Cassius and
Pompey had restored the republic, till
the pursuit of his enemies had slackened,
and time and his faithful servants had
supplied the means of his escape. Had
he even permitted the generous sacrifice
which his attendants were zealous to
make, and profited by the interval, which
their contest with the ruffians would have
afforded, to reach the shore; had he
looked, with a stern eye, on the tribune
and his followers, and rebuked them
with the eloquence whose force had been
so long irresistable; had he called up
the memory of past benefits, and
thundered
indignation in the ears of the
apostate Lnas, who knows but the
blood-hounds would have been eluded or
baffled, or disarmed of their sanguinary
purpose? They were wretches, incited
by the lust of gain, void of enmity to
Cicero, or love of his oppressors. The
bribe with which Anthony had bought
their zeal, might have easily been
doubled by Cicero, to purchase their
connivance at his flight. The hope of
promotion in the legions of the east,
might have changed them into guardians
of our safety, and companions of our
voyage. Thus had the magnanimity of
Marcus snatched him from worse perils,
and kept him from despairing of his life,
and his cause, though labouring under
a greater weight of years, encompassed
by enemies more numerous and more
triumphant: lonely, succourless, in chains
and immured in a dungeon!
But why do I calumniate the memory
of Cicero? Arraign the wisdom of his
conduct, and the virtue of his motives?
Had he not lived long enough for felicity
and usefulness? Was there cowardice or
error in refusing to mingle in the tumults
of war? In resigning to younger hands,
innured to military offices, the spear and
the shield? Is it more becoming the
brave to struggle for life; to preserve the
remnant which infirmity and old age had
left, than serenely to wait for death, and
encounter it with majestic composure?
Is it dishonourable to mourn over the
triumph of ambition, and the woes of our
country? To be impatient of life, when
divorced from liberty, and fated to
contemplate
the ruin of those schemes, on
which his powers had incessantly been
exercised, and whose purpose was the
benefit of mankind?
Yes. The close of thy day was
worthy its beginning and its progress.
Thou diest with no stain upon thy
virtue
.
The termination of thy course was
coveal with the ruin of thy country.
Thy hand had upheld the fabric of its
freedom and its happiness, as long as
human force was adequate to that end.
It fell, because the seeds of dissolution
had arrived at maturity, and the basis
and structure were alike dissolved. It
fell, and thou wast crushed in its ruins.
