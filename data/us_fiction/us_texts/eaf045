MARIUS AMONG THE RUINS OF CARTHAGE.
Pillars
are fallen at thy feet,
Fanes quiver in the air,
A prostrate city is thy seat,
And thou alone art there.
No change comes o'er thy noble brow,
Though ruin is around thee;
Thine eye-beam burns as proudly now,
As when the laurel crown'd thee.
It cannot bend thy lofty soul,
Though friends and fame depart;
The car of fate may o'er thee roll,
Nor crush thy Roman heart.
And genius hath electric power,
Which earth can never tame;
Bright suns may scorch, and dark clouds lower
Its flash is still the same!
The dreams we loved in early life,
May melt like mist away;
High thoughts may seem, 'mid passion's strife,
Like Carthage in decay.
And proud hopes in the human heart
May be to ruin hurl'd,
Like mould'ring monuments of art
Heap'd on a sleeping world.
Yet there is something will not die,
Where life hath once been fair;
Some towering thoughts still rear on high,
Some Roman lingers there!

THE LONE INDIAN.
A white man, gazing on the scene,
Would say a lovely spot was here,
And praise the lawns so fresh and green,
Between the hills so sheer.
I like it notI would the plain
Lay in its tall old groves again.

Powontonamo
was the son of a mighty
chief. He looked on his tribe with such a
fiery glance, that they called him the Eagle
of the Mohawks. His eye never blinked in
the sunbeam; and he leaped along the chase
like the untiring waves of Niagara. Even
when a little boy, his tiny arrow would hit
the frisking squirrel in the ear, and bring
down the humming bird on her rapid wing.
He was his father's pride and joy. He loved
to toss him high in his sinewy arms, and
shout, Look, Eagle-eye, look! and see the
big hunting-grounds of the Mohawks!
Powontonamo
will be their chief. The winds
will tell his brave deeds. When men speak
of him, they will not speak loud; but as if
the Great Spirit had breathed in thunder.
The prophecy was fulfilled. When
Powontonamo
became a man, the fame of his
beauty and courage reached the tribes of
Illinois; and even the distant Osage showed
his white teeth with delight, when he heard
the wild deeds of the Mohawk Eagle. Yet
was his spirit frank, chivalrous, and kind.
When the white men came to buy land, he
met them with an open palm, and spread
his buffalo for the traveller. The old chiefs
loved the bold youth, and offered their
daughters
in marriage. The eyes of the young
Indian
girls sparkled when he looked on them.
But he treated them all with the stern
indifference
of a warrior, until he saw
Soonseetah
raise her long dark eye-lash. Then
his heart melted beneath the beaming glance
of beauty. Soonseetah was the fairest of
the Oneidas. The young men of her tribe
called her the Sunny-eye. She was smaller
than her nation usually are; and her slight,
graceful figure was so elastic in its motions,
that the tall grass would rise up and shake off
1B
its dew drops, after her pretty moccasins had
pressed it. Many a famous chief had sought
her love; but when they brought the choicest
furs, she would smile disdainfully, and say,
Soonseetah's foot is warm. Has not her
father an arrow? When they offered her
food, according to the Indian custom, her
answer was, Soonseetah has not seen all
the warriors. She will eat with the bravest.
The hunters told the young Eagle, that
Sunny-eye of Oneida was beautiful as the
bright birds in the hunting-land beyond the
sky; but that her heart was proud, and she
said the great chiefs were not good enough
to dress venison for her. When
Powontonamo
listened to these accounts, his lip would
curl slightly, as he threw back his fur-edged
mantle, and placed his firm, springy foot
forward
,
so that the beads and shells of his rich
moccasin might be seen to vibrate at every
sound of his tremendous war song. If there
was vanity in the act, there was likewise
becoming
pride. Soonseetah heard of his
haughty smile, and resolved in her own
heart that no Oneida should sit beside her,
till she had seen the chieftain of the
Mohawks
.
Before many moons had passed
away, he sought her father's wigwam, to
carry delicate furs and shining shells to the
young coquette of the wilderness. She did
not raise her bright melting eye to his, when
he came near her; but when he said, Will
the Sunny-eye look on the gift of a
Mohawk
?
his barbed arrow is swift; his foot
never turned from the foe; the colour on
her brown cheek was glowing as an
autumnal
twilight. Her voice was like the troubled
note of the wren, as she answered, The
furs of Powontonamo are soft and warm to
the foot of Soonseetah. She will weave the
shells in the wampum belt of the Mohawk
Eagle. The exulting lover sat by her side,
and offered her venison and parched corn.
She raised her timid eye, as she tasted the
food; and then the young Eagle knew that
Sunny-eye would be his wife.
There was feasting and dancing, and the
marriage song rang merrily in Mohawk
cabins
,
when the Oneida came among them.
Powontonamo loved her as his own heart's
blood. He delighted to bring her the fattest
deers of the forest, and load her with the
ribbons and beads of the English. The
prophets of his people liked it not that the
strangers grew so numerous in the land.
They shook their heads mournfully, and
said, The moose and the beaver will not
live within sound of the white man's gun.
They will go beyond the lakes, and the
Indians
must follow their trail. But the young
chief laughed them to scorn. He said,
The land is very big. The mountain
eagle
could not fly over it in many days.
Surely
the wigwams of the English will never
cover it. Yet when he held his son in his
arms, as his father had done before him, he
sighed to hear the strokes of the axe levelling
the old trees of his forests. Sometimes he
looked sorrowfully on his baby boy, and
thought he had perchance done him much
wrong, when he smoked a pipe in the
wigwam
of the stranger.
One day, he left his home before the grey
mist of morning had gone from the hills,
to seek food for his wife and child. The
polar-star was bright in the heavens ere he
returned; yet his hands were empty. The
white man's gun had scared the beasts of
the forest, and the arrow of the Indian was
sharpened in vain. Powontonamo entered
his wigwam with a cloudy brow. He did
not look at Soonseetah; he did not speak to
her boy; but, silent and sullen, he sat
leaning
on the head of his arrow. He wept not,
for an Indian may not weep; but the
muscles
of his face betrayed the struggle within
his soul. The Sunny-eye approached
fearfully
,
and laid her little hand upon his
brawny shoulder, as she asked, Why is the
Eagle's eye on the earth? What has
Soonseetah
done, that her child dare not look in
the face of his father? Slowly the warrior
turned his gaze upon her. The expression
of sadness deepened, as he answered, The
Eagle has taken a snake to his nest: how
can his young sleep in it? The Indian
boy, all unconscious of the forebodings which
stirred his father's spirit, moved to his side,
and peeped up in his face with a mingled
expression of love and fear.
The heart of the generous savage was full,
even to bursting. His hand trembled, as he
placed it on the sleek black hair of his only
son. The Great Spirit bless thee! the
Great Spirit bless thee, and give thee back
the hunting ground of the Mohawk! he
exclaimed. Then folding him, for an
instant
,
in an almost crushing embrace, he
gave him to his mother, and darted from
the wigwam.
Two hours he remained in the open air;
but the clear breath of heaven brought no
relief to his noble and suffering soul.
Wherever he looked abroad, the ravages of
the civilized destroyer met his eye. Where
were the trees, under which he had frolicked
in infancy, sported in boyhood, and rested
after the fatigues of battle? They formed
the English boat, or lined the English
dwelling
.
Where were the holy sacrifice-heaps of
his people? The stones were taken to fence
in the land, which the intruder dared to call
his own. Where was his father's grave?
The stranger's road passed over it, and his
cattle trampled on the ground where the
mighty Mohawk slumbered. Where were
his once powerful tribe? Alas, in the white
man's wars they had joined with the British,
in the vain hope of recovering their lost
privileges
.
Hundreds had gone to their last
home; others had joined distant tribes; and
some pitiful wretches, whom he scorned to
call brethren, consented to live on the white
man's bounty. These were corroding
reflections
;
and well might fierce thoughts of
vengeance pass through the mind of the
deserted
prince; but he was powerless now;
and the English swarmed, like vultures
around the dying. It is the work of the
Great Spirit, said he. The Englishman's
God made the Indian's heart afraid; and
now he is like a wounded buffalo, when
hungry
wolves are on his trail.
When Powontonamo returned to his hut,
his countenance, though severe, was
composed
.
He spoke to the Sunny-eye with more
kindness than the savage generally addresses
the wife of his youth; but his look told her
that she must not ask the grief which had put
a woman's heart within the breast of the
far-famed
Mohawk Eagle.
The next day, when the young chieftain
went out on a hunting expedition, he was
accosted by a rough, square-built farmer.
Powow, said he, your squaw has been
stripping a dozen of my trees, and I don't
like it over much. It was a moment when
the Indian could ill brook a white man's
insolence
.
Listen, Buffalo-head! shouted
he; and as he spoke he seized the shaggy
pate of the unconscious offender, and eyed
him with the concentrated venom of an
ambushed
rattlesnake,Listen to the chief of
the Mohawks! These broad lands are all
his own. When the white man first left his
cursed foot-print in the forest, the Great Bear
looked down upon the big tribes of Iroquois
and Abnaquis. The wigwams of the noble
Delawares were thick, where the soft winds
dwell. The rising sun glanced on the fierce
Pequods; and the Illinois, the Miamies, and
warlike tribes like the hairs of your head,
marked his going down. Had the red man
struck you then, your tribes would have been
as dry grass to the lightning! Goshall the
Sunny-eye of Oneida ask the pale face for a
basket? He breathed out a quick,
convulsive
laugh, and his white teeth showed
through his parted lips, as he shook the
farmer
from him, with the strength and fury of a
raging panther.
After that, his path was unmolested, for no
one dared to awaken his wrath; but a smile
never again visited the dark countenance of
the degraded chief. The wild beasts had
fled so far from the settlements, that he would
hunt days and days without success.
Soonseetah
sometimes begged him to join the
remnant of the Oneidas, and persuade them
to go far off, toward the setting sun.
Powontonamo
replied, This is the burial place
of my fathers; and the Sunny-eye dared
say no more.
At last, their boy sickened and died, of a
fever he had taken among the English.
They buried him beneath a spreading oak,
on the banks of the Mohawk, and heaped
stones upon his grave, without a tear. He
must lie near the water, said the desolate
chief, else the white man's horses will tread
on him.
The young mother did not weep; but her
heart had received its death-wound. The
fever seized her, and she grew paler and
weaker every day. One morning,
Powontonamo
returned with some delicate food he
had been seeking for her. Will Soonseetah
eat? said he. He spoke in a tone of
subdued
tenderness; but she answered not.
The foot which was wont to bound forward
to meet him, lay motionless and cold. He
raised the blanket which partly concealed
her face, and saw that the Sunny-eye was
closed in death. One hand was pressed hard
against her heart, as if her last moments had
been painful. The other grasped the beads
which the young Eagle had given her in the
happy days of courtship. One heart-rending
shriek was rung from the bosom of the
agonized
savage. He tossed his arms wildly
above his head, and threw himself beside the
body of her he had loved as fondly, deeply,
and passionately, as ever a white man loved.
After the first burst of grief had subsided, he
carefully untied the necklace from her full,
beautiful bosom, crossed her hands over the
sacred relic, and put back the shining black
hair from her smooth forehead. For hours
he watched the corpse in silence. Then he
arose and carried it from the wigwam. He
dug a grave by the side of his lost boy; laid
the head of Soonseetah toward the rising sun;
heaped the earth upon it, and covered it with
stones, according to the custom of his people.
Night was closing in, and still the
bereaved
Mohawk stood at the grave of Sunny-eye,
as motionless as its cold inmate. A white
man, as he passed, paused, and looked in
pity on him. Are you sick? asked he.
Yes; me sick. Me very sick here,
answered
Powontonamo, laying his hand upon
his swelling heart. Will you go home?
Home!
exclaimed the heart broken chief,
in tones so thrilling, that the white man
started. Then slowly, and with a half
vacant
look, he added, Yes; me go home.
By and by me go home. Not another
word would he speak; and the white man
left him, and went his way. A little while
longer he stood watching the changing
heavens; and then, with reluctant step,
retired
to his solitary wigwam.
The next day, a tree, which Soonseetah
had often said was just as old as their boy,
was placed near the mother and child. A
wild vine was straggling among the loose
stones, and Powontonamo carefully twined it
around the tree. The young oak is the
Eagle of the Mohawks, he said; and now
the Sunny-eye has her arms round him.
He spoke in the wild music of his native
tongue; but there was none to answer.
Yes; Powontonamo will go home, sighed
he. He will go where the sun sets in the
ocean, and the white man's eyes have never
looked upon it. One long, one lingering
glance at the graves of his kindred, and the
Eagle of the Mohawks bade farewell to the
land of his fathers.
* * * * * *
For many a returning autumn, a lone
Indian
was seen standing at the consecrated
spot we have mentioned; but, just thirty
years after the death of Soonseetah, he was
noticed for the last time. His step was then
firm, and his figure erect, though he seemed
old and way-worn. Age had not dimmed
the fire of his eye, but an expression of deep
melancholy had settled on his wrinkled brow.
It was Powontonamohe who had once been
the Eagle of the Mohawks! He came to
lie down and die beneath the broad oak,
which shadowed the grave of Sunny-eye.
Alas! the white man's axe had been there!
The tree he had planted was dead; and the
vine, which had leaped so vigorously from
branch to branch, now, yellow and withering,
was falling to the ground. A deep groan
burst from the soul of the savage. For thirty
wearisome years, he had watched that oak,
with its twining tendrils. They were the
only things left in the wide world for him to
love, and they were gone! He looked
abroad. The hunting land of his tribe was
changed, like its chieftain. No light canoe
now shot down the river, like a bird upon
the wing. The laden boat of the white man
alone broke its smooth surface. The
Englishman's
road wound like a serpent around
the banks of the Mohawk; and iron hoofs
had so beaten down the war-path, that a
hawk's eye could not discover an Indian
track. The last wigwam was destroyed;
and the sun looked boldly down upon spots
he had visited only by stealth, during
thousands
and thousands of moons. The few
remaining
trees, clothed in the fantastic
mourning
of autumn; the long line of heavy clouds,
melting away before the coming sun; and
the distant mountain, seen through the blue
mist of departing twilight, alone remained as
he had seen them in his boyhood. All
things spoke a sad language to the heart of
the desolate Indian. Yes, said he, the
young oak and the vine are like the Eagle
and the Sunny-eye. The are cut down, torn,
and trampled on. The leaves are falling, and
the clouds are scattering, like my people. I
wish I could once more see the trees standing
thick, as they did when my mother held me
to her bosom, and sung the warlike deeds of
the Mohawks.
A mingled expression of grief and anger
passed over his face, as he watched a loaded
boat in its passage across the stream. The
white man carries food to his wife and
children
,
and he finds them in his home, said he.
Where is the squaw and the papoose of the
red man? They are here! As he spoke,
he fixed his eye thoughtfully upon the grave.
After a gloomy silence, he again looked
round upon the fair scene, with a wandering
and troubled gaze. The pale face may
like it, murmered he; but an Indian
cannot
die here in peace. So saying, he broke
his bow string, snapped his arrows, threw
them on the burial place of his fathers, and
departed for ever.
* * *
None ever knew where Powontonamo laid
his dying head. The hunters from the west
said, a red man had been among them, whose
tracks were far off toward the rising sun;
that he seemed like one who had lost his
way, and was sick to go home to the Great
2
Spirit. Perchance, he slept his last sleep
where the distant Missisippi receives its
hundred
streams. Alone, and unfriended, he
may have laid him down to die, where no
man called him brother; and the wolves of
the desert, long ere this, may have howled
the death-song of the Mohawk Eagle.
THE SAGACIOUS PAPA:
A HINT FOR THOSE IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
If a woman will, she willyou may depend on 't;
And if she won't, she won'tso there's an end on't.
I think
it is very cruel of papa, said
Olive May,a pretty little, pouting, petted,
rose-bud beauty,I had rather he would
refuse
me any thing else, than try to cross me
in my affections. I could never love
anybody
else but James Ingraham; yet he will
try to persuade me that Robert King is much
the best match. I wish I might never see
that coxcomb again.
These peevish words were spoken to a
fashionable aunt, no longer
Is
-a-bel, but
Was
-a-belle, who had abundantly proved
the vanity of the world; yet loved the
dear delusion still. A smile, half malicious
and half playful, curled her thin lips, as she
answered composedly, You should never
suffer yourself to speak in such a vixenish
tone, Olive; you will spoil the sweetness of
2A
your voice; and that would be a very great
misfortune to a belle. Then patting her
cheek with her fan, she said, I will go talk
with this cruel father. He shan't abuse it,
darlingIt shall love who it pleases, and
marry who it pleases; so it shall. And
Olive, hoping great things from her aunt
Isabel's
intercession, smiled sweetly, and was
herself again.
Before we acquaint our readers with the
result of this intercession, we will give them
a brief sketch of Olive's lovers. She had
three declared ones; and a hundred, or so,
that looked at her, and sighed for her fortune.
The first in date, was James Ingraham; with
whom she had become acquainted during her
father's absence in Europe. He was a
worthy
young man; short and fat; with a sort
of rosy, vulgar beauty about his square face;
and the most important of all his
qualifications
was, that he was the very first lover
Olive ever had. He had good abilities, and
was a promising scholar; but he wore dirty
white silk gloves, longer than his hand; and
he would lean back in his chair; and some
how or other his elbows were always
making
mathematical demonstrations; and his
shoulders alone pourtrayed the curving line
of beauty.
The next was a Polish count, who showed
a dozen stars and garters, and told how much
he had suffered in the cause of liberty, and
swore, forty times a week, that Olive was
fairer than the moon, and his love eternal as
the sun.
Last of all, was Robert King, tall, graceful,
well-proportioned, and just returned from
Paris. In all external graces, he was a
model
;
and the ladies only wondered at one
thing, viz. that he should have spent two
years in Paris, and yet wear his hair just as
he did when he went away. But Robert
King had studied the subject of his own
physiognomy even more deeply than they
had; elaborate thought, and patient
experiment
,
had led him to the conclusion that he
had chosen the best style for displaying his
magnificent white forehead to advantage.
Moreover, his residence in Europe had filled
him with high hopes, and lofty aspirations:
B2
when he left his native country, he was
merely ambitious to follow every turn of
fashion
;
but now, convinced he could outdo the
volatile goddess, his great ambition was, that
the fashion should follow him.
The ladies were all in a twitter about him;
he danced so lazily, and he flattered so
delicately
;
and he drove such beautiful horses;
and he so often made them think how
difficult
it was to please a man who had waltzed
and sung with European beauties! To
overcome
his provoking indifference was a
glorious
achievement, which every one was
anxious
to perform. The victory was gained
by Olive May, with her pretty face, and still
prettier fortune, without an effort on her
part; and probably for the very reason that
he saw she made no effort.
Robert King had the father's wishes and
exertions on his side; for he was the son of
a wealthy Broker, and the leading star of
fashion. It was not at all wonderful that
the fop should be preferred to the clown, and
discount triumph over the Count.
But Olive was not quite as wise as her
father; for it is a lamentable fact that
Providence
seldom places old heads on lily-white
shoulders. She had read in novels, that the
first love never changed; and she was
determined
to love James Ingraham forever,
and forever; and should her cruel father
disinherit
her, she would love him the more
that she would.
Such was the state of affairs, when aunt
Isabel volunteered her services. It seemed
that she was eminently successful; for the
next day, Mr. May told his daughter that he
was very sorry to see her so unhappy; that
since the subject was disagreeable to her, he
would never again mention the name of
Robert
King; that he had a great regard for Mr.
Ingraham, and certainly would not thwart
her wishes by any opposition. One thing,
however, he should expect her to yield to
him; she was quite too young to be married
at present; and it was absolutely necessary
she should travel a little, to finish her
education
,
and give her the air and manner of
the world.
Olive was delighted at the thoughts of
New-York and Saratoga; and she was sure
she was very much delighted with
permission
to retain her old lover; but perhaps she
felt a little disappointed, after all, to find the
course of true love run so smooth
martyrdom
is certainly a very exciting sort of thing,
and mortals in all ages have been eager for it.
Olive kissed aunt Isabel a hundred times
over, and said she would write to James
every day of her life; and asked what
colours
she thought most becoming; and had
James' hair put into a golden locket; and
sent all over the city for the last La Belle
Assemblee, with its tasteful print of
fashions
;
and ordered a dozen new sets of
jewels
,
and tried twice a dozen styles of dressing
her hair; and always ended all her
operations
by wondering whether James would
pine away during her absence. What an
odd jumble of gauze and love, trinkets and
expectation, is the mind of a belle!
The important day came; and the lovers
parted with many vows. At New-York, at
the Springs, at Quebec, every where, the
world stood furbelowed and on tip-toe, to
meet the beauty and the heiress! Her little
head
began to spin round; and no wonder
that her
heart
began to spin with it. It is
true they seldom unite their operations in
the world of fashion; but then they are both
unimportant articlesit is all the better to
have extremely little of the one, and none
at all of the other.
At first, Olive adhered to her resolution
of writing every day; but by and by she
felt the necessity of letting the mail go
without
any token of her love. She danced so
late; and she was so sleepy in the morning;
and crowds of beaux came the moment she
was dressed; and she found it was impossible
to get along without a dozen new dresses;
and positively the mantua-makers took so
much of her time, that she
could not
write
to Jamesshe was sure he would'nt blame
her, if he knew how she was situated. Her
father reproved her for this neglect, and urged
her not to let another day pass without
sending
a letter; and aunt Isabel reminded her
how often she had said, James would be
lonesome as death when she was gone. I
wish they would just let me alone, thought
the wayward beauty, I wonder they need
to tease me so. I am sure I love James just
as well as ever I did. I wonder whether he
wears silk gloves, now? I mean to tell him
it is not genteel. I wish he could dance as
well as Robert KingRobert King is
certainly
a very elegant young man; and all the
young ladies are bewitched about him.
Our readers will naturally suppose that
Olive was not gratified in her angry wish of
never seeing that coxcomb again.
Everywhere
she went, he was her shadow. If she
raised her eyes, she met his, resting upon
her in silent worship; he sighed when she
danced with another; and stood at her side
when she was fatigued. All her companions
envied her; and not one would allow she
was beautiful.
He
thinks I am, thought
Olive, as she glanced at her full length figure
in the mirror; and as she sat with one tiny
shoe in her hand, and the other half untied,
she said audibly. He is'nt so much of a
coxcomb, after all. Who? inquired
aunt Isabel, with great gravity of manner.
Robert King, aunt; you know I used to
detest him; but I really think he is quite
agreeable. Don't you think he has altered
very much lately? I think he has,
answered
aunt Isabel: and unperceived by
Olive, a mischievous light sparkled and
mantled
all over her face, as she held out a
letter
,
saying, Here is news from James.
Olive blushed deeply; and as she read the
letter, the blush grew warmer and warmer.
Oh dear! she exclaimed, he does
nothing
but preachpreach. His letters are
full of complaints and advice. I am sure he
knows my constancy well enoughand he
might
know it is utterly impossible for me to
write every day. Now, the fact was, she
had not written for four weeksand three
weeks more passed, and still she could not
find time to write. Her father blamed her
and her aunt scolded her. It was very
vexatious
but
indeed it was
impossible
for her
to write.
At last James came, in person, to
ascertain
the state of affairs. She met him with
blushes and welcomesand she glanced her
eye on Robert King, and then on himand
she wondered James
would
make a bow
sidewaysit was so very awkward.
She danced with him, and she thought she
saw the young ladies laugh. She asked him
to go to dancing school, and to buy kid
gloves. She wondered what made her
father
give up his opposition so easilyshe
wondered when Robert King meant to offer
himself againand she wondered when
James was going away.
Is there need to tell the catastrophe?
James left the Springs in high displeasure;
and papa and aunt Isabel exchanged very
knowing looks.
I leave good arithmeticians to balance the
loss and gainJames lost the heart of a
belle, and Olive gained the heart of a
coxcomb

TO A LADY,
CELEBRATED FOR MUSICAL TALENT.
Methinks, it should have been impossible
Not to love all things in a world so filled;
Where the breeze warbles, and the mute, still air,
Is Music slumbering on her instrument.
Coleridge
.
Thanks,
Orphea, thanks! Thy magic spell
Has waked my soul to sound;
And deep within a sealed well
A spring of joy is found!
My ear was like the wayward strings,
Which the wild winds breathe o'er;
And fitful in its echoings,
Has my spirit been before!
But something in my inmost heart
Responds to each touch of thine,
And bids me own thy wond'rous art
The soul of the tuneful Nine.
Yes, all I've dream'd of bright or fair,
Is but embodied sound
Music is floating on the air,
In every thing around!
All Nature hath of breezy grace,
In motion swift and free,
Each lovely hue upon her face,
Is living melody.
Well might thy witchery inspire
The bard's enraptured lay,
And flashes of prophetic fire
Around thy fingers play;
But vainly would the haunted king
Have sought relief from thee,
For chain'd had been each demon's wing
By thy rich minstrelsy.
Priestess of a mighty power!
My spirit worships thee;
For inspiration is thy dower
Thy voice is poetry!
THE RIVAL BROTHERS.
A TALE OF THE REVOLUTION.
It is a fearful taleyet true.
It
was in the middle of one of the most
delightful days in June, that I commenced
a short journey, which led me through the
cool sequestered forests on the eastern shore
of Massachusetts. Few things are more
enchanting
,
than to saunter through the woods
during a summer's noon. Nature, enjoying
the deep tranquillity of a most voluptuous
repose
,
the gay warbling of the birds, changed
for that occasional twitter which speaks the
full enjoyment of their tiny hearts, more
plainly than the rich burst of their morning
song; the very butterflies, like gay coquettes,
weary of conquest, closing and spreading
their gorgeous wings in languid indifference;
the deep shade; the drowsy splendour
mantling
the distant hills; all these bring to me a
delicious sense of quiet existence, which no
other scene produces.
During my ride, every thing tended to
heighten this feeling to the utmost. I could
not mistake that I was in the land of my
fore-fathers
.
Even Nature bears the aspect of
those venerable heralds of our freedom; and
Time, while he has led wealth, taste, and
fashion
,
through all our favoured land, has passed
by these secluded spots with religious awe,
and scarcely brushed the antiquated scene
with noiseless wing. The faces you meet
are as a title-page, on which by-gone days
are written; the children have the
reverential
demeanour of the olden time; the
sea-breeze
murmurs through the wood, with more
of psalmody than song; and the very
moss-grown
stones have an air of Puritan sanctity.
My companion was one with whom I was
too familiar to strive to be agreeable; and
they, who cannot be eloquent when effort is
unnecessary, may forever despair of the
power
.
Conversation is always delightful when
the thoughts spring spontaneously from the
tongue, attended with all the contagious
exhilaration
of wit and talent; but it is even
more delightful, when catching its tone from
surrounding objects, it flows gently on,
deriving
new charms from the scene around,
and new interest from the circumstances
under
which we enjoy it. Such a conversation
I was at this moment listening to from my
companion, and every instant with increasing
pleasure. It was suddenly interrupted by
the appearance of one of the most frightful
and loathsome-looking objects my eyes ever
beheld. The lofty and projecting forehead,
and the bold, rigid contour of the head, all
indicated
the possession of prodigious power;
and the spark of hell burning in his eye,
proved that power had been exerted for the
prince of darkness. He was clothed in the
squalid and tattered drapery of exceeding
poverty; and deeply had age graven upon
his iron visage the lines of guilt and passion.
The painter and the sculptor could not have
found a more fitting personification of
pestilence
or crime.
At the sight of us, he darted into the woods
with that instinctive aversion which ever
leads the fallen spirit to shun a purer nature.
My companion knew him well; and at my
request, repeated the terrible incidents of his
life. As nearly as I can recollect, they are
contained in the following story.
Among the numerous families who
worshipped
the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
in 1776, few, even in the days of primitive
devotion, were more blameless in life and
conversation, than those of Eliphalet
Warner
and Lois Leslie. Their dwellings joined
each other; and their children had grown up
together, healthy and beautiful, as the trim
shrubbery around their doors. Frances, the
only daughter of the widow Leslie, was the
sweetest little wild-flower that ever
breathed
fragrance on this sinful world. Seldom
has nature blended in one countenance two
such striking characteristics of loveliness.
Mildness was the prevailing expression; and
it was not until we had looked again and
again upon her large blue eye, that it
revealed
its depth of meaning. Thought was
there, not in the grandeur of beaming
inspiration
,
but tranquil as a waveless lake, pure
as the intelligence of angels, and joyous as
infancy in its happy dreams. There is a
nameless light in this spiritual kind of beauty.
It comes from the sun of a world brighter
and holier than our own. The painter, the
poet, the sculptor, have never embodied it;
and nature, with all her radiance, her bloom
and purity, affords no metaphor. The
mother
,
faded and care-worn, was still such a
one as, once seen, could not easily be
forgotten
.
Her face manly, but not masculine, in
its outline, and energetic in its expression,
indicated the possession of vehement
feeling
;
but its serious and somewhat severe
aspect
,
told that youthful enthusiasm had been
checked by many sorrows, and that the waves
of affection, repressed on every side, had
worn a channel deep into the soul. An only
son, the stay and staff of her old age,
recently
returned from the American camp,
exhausted
by long and painful illness,
completed
the number of their affectionate
household
.
Mr. Warner, a rigid, but kind-hearted old
man, had long been deprived of the partner
of his youthful days. It was strange for one
apparently so harsh in his nature, but though
3
his hand and his heart were ever open to his
neighbour, and though his eye lighted up
with all a father's joy when Frances stood
before him in her loveliness, yet his thoughts
were ever with her who slept his last sleep;
and the old man lived in the bosom of his
family
,
estranged from all others save the widow
and her charming daughter. Two sons were
all that remained to him, and they were a most
striking instance of dissimilarity of character,
produced by the same education, and the
same habits of life. That intellect differs in
native vigour in various individuals, and is
strong in any peculiar department only from
the accidental direction of attention, has been
abundantly proved; but supposing the mind
to be thus bent by circumstances and
situation
,
how hard it is to trace the hidden
causes, which create in the same family such
various modifications of moral purity and
mental force.
Joseph and William Warner looked as
unlike
each other as they really were in
pursuits
and inclinations. Joseph was dark,
lowering, and designing; with eyes deeply
set, and looking out from beneath their
shaggy
brows, like the fiery balls of a tiger
hidden
in the clefts of a precipice. William's
complexion was likewise dark, but his
expression
was extremely noble and ingenuous,
and his face had much of fresh youthful
beauty. Joseph was a furious Tory; William
a firm and decided Whig. Both were the
declared lovers of their fair neighbour; and
both had been told by her judicious mother
to wait for more peaceful times, and until
maturer years should enable her to judge
discreetly and decide wisely. In habits of
unreserved intimacy with bothtreated as a
cherished sister by William, and the
alternate
object of the most headstrong love, and
the most taunting jealousy of his fiery
brother
it
seemed for a long time doubtful how
the balance would turn.
I know not why it is, but impetuosity,
ardour
,
and lordliness of manner, are usually
exceedingly attractive to woman. It is, I
believe, simply that worship of power, which
exists in every human mind. The same
principle that prostrates the soul before
nature
3A
in its wildness and majesty, and before
art in its magnificent desolation, bows it down
to the might and energy of man. Some have
said that the fearless and unprincipled have
readiest access to the female heart, merely
because they are so; but they know little of
woman's character who say or think this. If
the unprincipled obtain superior influence, it
is because boldness is mistaken for strength,
and moral insanity for intellectual vigour.
To the timid eye of Frances, a character
torn and convulsed by contending passions
seemed to have a fearful grandeur. Her
reason told her that William was a thousand
times more fitted to make her happy, but
imagination hovered round the image of
Joseph
,
and veiled its darkness with her own
seraph wings. Her gentle nature shrunk
from his ferocity, and she dreaded an
influence
which she always found tumultuous
and exciting; but, like the bird charmed by
a rattlesnake, the greater her fear the more
powerful the attraction. Such was her state
of feeling on the evening we choose to
present
her to our readers; and that night was
one of deep interest to the whole village.
The sergeant of a recruiting regiment was
among them, and every one was awaiting the
result of the draughts with painful anxiety.
Young Leslie, dying for the cause in which
his young comrades were about to engage,
turned restlessly on his pillow, watching for
the entrance of William Warner, with all the
eagerness that weakness and lassitude would
allow; and Frances and her mother,
attending
to his wants, and glancing at the window
every time a cloud flitted across the declining
sun, betrayed the same inquietude. At
length the silence was interrupted by the
entrance of William. Mother and daughter
sprang forward to meet him; and the invalid
fixed a most piercing look upon him. Not a
word was spokenbut he felt what they
would ask, and covering his face with both
his hands, he exclaimed, I am! The
sick man groaned deeply; Frances burst
into
a flood of tears; and the matron, with a
firm countenance, but a bursting heart,
clasped
his hand warmly as she said, Well, none
but our God will be left to guard us now.
3B
But go, my young friend, strong in the Lord
of Hosts. These are solemn times. Men
must act, and women must endure. Oh,
if I could but act! exclaimed the invalid;
oh, my bleeding country! that ever my
arm should be weak at an hour like this.
But, my dear William, said Frances,
will it be very long before you return to
us? It may be very long, he replied;
and his heart swelled almost to breaking,
when he looked on the fair creature, and
thought of the chance of battle. Before he
could add more, his elder brother abruptly
pushed before him. There are others
going
,
as well as you, sir, exclaimed he,
glancing at the tearful Frances, and eyeing
William with the most malignant expression
of jealousy and scorn. Where, asked the
astonished widow;To the British camp,
was the surly reply. Young Leslie made a
violent exertion to rise upon his elbow, but,
exhausted with the effort, sank upon his
pillow
,
with an expression in which indignation
and pain were contending for victory.
Joseph, said his brother, in a tender,
but reproachful tone, At least spare our
good father this dreadful blow. Take
care of your own concerns, Mr. Morality,
answered the renegade; the old man ought
to be proud of a red coat in his family.
Heavens! exclaimed William, are not
burning townsgushing blooda father
struck to the earth in his old age, by a
British
officer;are not all these enough to
rouse you to a sense of outraged rights? I
should glory to die in such a cause. God
grant you may have your wish, brave brother
of mine, answered he, with a look of the
most bitter hatred. Frances shrunk from
him, as from a fiend. He had never before
dared to unveil his depravity to her view;
and her mother, though she well knew him
to be fierce and ungovernable, was thrilled
with horror at his demoniac expression.
Finding himself an object of distrust and
abhorrence
,
and trying in vain to exert his
accustomed
power over Frances, he left them
at an early hour, without deigning to say one
word of kindness or exculpation.
Imagination
thus rudely driven from the hold which
reason had long ago represented as
dangerous
,
clung to the excellent William, with a
tenderness, which Frances had never before
experienced for him. Mrs. Leslie had not
suspected her predilection for Joseph; for
deep and passionate love is seldom
unreserved
in its nature; and the ready smile of frank
affection which she ever bestowed upon
William
,
might well have been mistaken for
feelings
deeper than they really were. Beside
the love they all bore him, their hearts were
naturally softened towards one just about to
engage in a doubtful and bloody cause; and
the young man returned to his home that night,
more than blessed in the conviction that the
dangers which surrounded him had awakened
affection where he most wished to awaken it.
When Frances entered Mr. Warner's
house the ensuing evening, she found the old
man seated at his door, in a high wicker
backed chair. Beside him lay a heavy,
brazen-hilted sword, on which his eye rested
with a sort of uneasy abstraction. At the
sound of her voice, he raised his head, and
gave one of those beaming looks of welcome,
which her presence always called forth.
You've said a kind farewell to my boy,
exclaimed he, and blessing on you for it.
He will go forth to his duty with a lighter
heart. And Joseph, he is gone too? said
she, blushing slightly. Name him not!
replied
the old man, with sternness in his voice
and manner. He has quarreled with his
father
,
curst the best of brothers, and last night
left us, without one farewell, to join the
hateful oppressors of his country. I have
always thought, said Frances, in an agitated
tone, that his words were more wicked than
his intentions. I have hoped so, till of
late, replied he, and it is even now hard
for a father's heart to believe in the guilt of
a son; but do you know, my child, that when
I told him he did not deserve the sword of
his ancestors, and that I should give it to his
younger brother, he cursed me to my face,
and would have stabbed William to the heart.
Oh! he is black with crime. Wo be to all
who have part or lot with him.
The sound of distant drums here
interrupted
the conversation. It grew nearer and
nearer, and presently a ragged, miserably
equipped, and worse disciplined, band came
upon the sight; yet women and children, the
aged and infirm, welcomed them with more
heartfelt gratitude, and deeper respect, than
has often been given to the glittering
pageantry
of military despots. Who, that saw
that wretched troop of young patriots eagerly
marching to join the standard of Washington
and the youthful La Fayette, would have
believed that, ere half a century had elapsed,
the aged La Fayette would have been
welcomed
in the flourishing capital of
New-England
,
with all the magnificence of wealth,
the pomp and circumstance of war! Who
could have believed that the infant, then
presented at Freedom's altar, there to be
baptized in blood and tears, would so soon
have been a giant among the nations?
The music, loud, rapid, and merry, spoke
the cheerfulness of the departing regiment;
but when the dwelling of Mr. Warner and
the widow Leslie came in view, by one
unanimous
impulse the music ceased, the march
stoppedand dividing to right and left, they
lowered their guns to the father of William
Warner. There were peculiar reasons why
these houses were dear to them all. There
was young Leslie, who had gone forth at the
loud call of his country's distress as healthy
and buoyant as theyand how had he
returned
?
To send forth the soul in one
agonizing
bound of the field of battle, had few
terrors for youthful enthusiasm; but the
stoutest hearts shuddered at days of
wearisome
sickness, and the slow progress of
loathsome
decay. Then there was the venerable
father of Warner, whose sage counsels were
the oracles of the village, and whose intrepid
spirit had given nerve and sinew to them all.
There was the widow Leslie, who always
had a smile, as cheerful and encouraging as
if the last stay of her old age was not about
to be reft from her in this hour of need.
Then there was Frances, so lovely, so
beloved
,
bringing the strongest claim that can
be brought to the heart of manthat of
helpless
beauty and unguarded innocence.
Therefore
it was that, while mothers, sisters and
infant brothers, were looking from every door
and window, they chose to halt here, and pay
their last farewell. Often, during their brief
march, they had stopped to give their little
ones a parting kiss, and to receive the
prayers
,
tears, and blessings of those who were
near and dear. But now they paused for the
last time; and they paused, too, where every
thing conspired to make their last adieu more
agonizing.
Come to me, William, said the old man,
in a clear, firm tone. The youth stepped
forward, and lowering his hand on his rifle,
kneeled at his father's feet. My son,
continued he, here is the sword of your
brave old grandfather. It did deadly
execution
in the French war; and his hand
was clenched around it in his dying hour.
It is an heir-loom in the family, and should
have been given to my oldest boy; but
his voice choked, and for a moment the
veteran
covered his face with his hands, and
rested on the hilt of the weapon.
Farewell
,
my son, my only son, continued he, in
a trembling voice, I can go down to my
grave alone. The God of Israel bless thee,
and anoint thee with strength for these times
of peril. The young soldier pressed his
father's
hand with a convulsive grasp, gave
one long, one lingering, farewell to the spot
where his beloved Frances stood by the side
of her mother, and fearing to trust a single
word, hastily rejoined his companions. There
was not a dry eye among them; and when
they came directly in front of Mrs. Leslie's,
all involuntarily uttered a shuddering groan.
James Leslie had entreated to be bolstered
up in his chair, to take a last look of his
youthful associates. There he sat, pale,
wasted, and agonized with pain; his head
reposing upon his mother's bosom, and his
sister standing beside him like a seraph at
the couch of the dying. An unnatural
intensity
of light poured from his eyes, and he
raised his hand in a faint attempt to make a
victorious flourish, as he exclaimed, God
will give us the victory. He started up,
with one sudden bound of anguishhis head
sunk on his shoulderthe glazed eyes
remained
fixed on the youthful band before
him; but they saw no longer.
To the young soldiers there was something
dreadfully attractive in the rayless look of
the corpse before them. It seemed as if the
very dead urged them onward. William
would have given his life to have returned
for a while to his friends, to aid and sooth
them in this dreadful trial; but a longer time
than usual had already been allowed to the
indulgence of personal feeling, and the
officers
were impatient of delay. The music
struck up; and amid sobs, and groans, and
tears, with brave but lacerated hearts, they
bade a long farewell to their humble homes.
Sad, sad indeed, was the dwelling of the
widow Leslie on the ensuing day. Alas!
how little do we appreciate the courage of
our fathers, and the fortitude of our mothers,
at the soul-trying period of our revolution.
In all scenes of public distress, woman is
compelled to make exertions, not the less
painful, or the less difficult, because they
are not performed on the public theatre of a
sympathising world. To fasten the
knapsack
round a father's neck, to fill the
cartridges
of a beloved husband, and see him go
forth to battle, when his little ones are crying
for bread, and his desolate home is left at the
mercy of the ravager; to have none left to
dig the grave of an only son, and to consign
him to the cold, damp earth, wept over only
by the aged and the helpless, require no
ordinary
effort of human strength. Yet such
were but every-day scenes, during our
desperate
struggle for independence. Mrs.
Leslie
bore her sorrows with even more firmness
than distinguished most women of that
period
.
True, she was staid, and sometimes
melancholy, like one who had left behind
her all the verdant spots in the wearisome
desert of life; yet she was ever active in her
duties, ever ready to sympathise in the griefs
and anxieties of others. The voice of
Frances
lost nothing of its melodious kindness,
and the matrons of the village looked on her
light step with as much pride as they had
in the happy days of her childhood; but a
shadow had passed over the sunshine of her
face, and when she smiled on her mother, it
was in the deep sadness of anxious love.
Months passed away. The far-off din of
battle came to them, only in broken and
uncertain
echoes. In the new state of the
country, and at that troubled period, all
communication
between the army and their
friends was difficult and dangerous. Nothing
was known of Joseph since his abrupt
departure
.
Whether he had actually joined the
British forces, or merely secreted himself
from his infuriated countrymen, remained
doubtful. William had not been seen or
heard of, since the thrilling look of tenderness
and pity which he gave to Frances, as she
stood by the side of her lifeless brother; but
morning and evening, fervent prayers for his
safety arose from the lips of those by whom
he was so deservedly beloved. Left to the
quiet communion of her own spirit, Frances
found that her affection for him had taken deep
and vigorous root. Each succeeding day
increased
its power; for it is one of the strangest
perversities of love, that absence strengthens
it far more than constant presence. The
memory
of his devotedness to her and her
widowed
parent was associated with every thing
around her; and each day, some deficiency
in their household comfort reminded them of
the industry and kindness which had so
promptly supplied their wants. A thousand
nameless attentions, trifling in themselves,
but invaluable to a woman's heart, crowded
upon her memory. She sent him a letter,
in which this state of feeling was most frankly
expressed; and when one tedious week after
another passed away, she gave herself up to
the conviction that it had never reached him.
A brief note did, however, at last arrive. It
contained merely violent protestations of
unalterable
attachment, and besought her to
meet him, between the hours of six and
seven, in an adjoining wood. It stated that
life and death depended on her secresy, and
that even her mother must not know of the
interview.
Why is this mystery, thought Frances,
as she read and re-read the singular epistle.
Probably he has stolen from military duty,
and detection would be death, said she to
herself, yet surely my mother might know
of it. All her conjectures ended in the
supposition that William had some good
reason
,
and that she ought to comply with his
request. Fear never once crossed her
guileless
imagination. William had, from his
cradle
,
been to her as a brother; and to distrust
him was like dreading contagion in the pure
balmy air she had breathed from childhood.
At an early hour she was seen passing
through the village,her little, well-known
gypsy-hat lightly resting on a profusion of
glossy hair, beautiful as a shower of
sunbeams
.
She had given a parting kiss to her
mother and Mr. Warner, with a joyousness
for which they could not account; and as
her slender little figure passed along like a
vision of light, the neighbours all remarked
that her smile was brighter, and her step far
more buoyant than usual.
Evening came and she returned not. The
fears of the anxious mother increased to
dreadful intensity. At last a traveller told
of horrible screams which he had heard from
the wood. A large band of old men, women,
and children, suddenly collected, and
hastened
to the spot he indicated. Alas! the hand
of violence had cut her down in her youth
and beauty! The lovely face, still and pale
as marble, had yet a shadow of the imploring
look which last passed over it; her long, fair
hair was tangled in the shrubbery; and the
sword, which had been a farewell present to
her lover, lay all bloody at her side. Those
who heard her mother's shriek, carried the
remembrance of it to their graves. She had
endured much, but her burden was mightier
than she could bear. She never smiled after
she had looked upon that fearful sight. Her
short life was but protracted agony; and
before
three months had elapsed, she slept by
the side of her murdered daughter.
There needed no sybil to point out the
assassin. When the light of their lanthorns
first fell on the lifeless being so dear to them
all, the wretched father of William Warner
clasped his hands in convulsive agony, and
groaned out, Oh! Joseph, Joseph! And
he indeed it was, whose guilty hands had
thus madly torn the beauteous one from life,
and its most enchanting hopes. His hatred
of a brother, whose excellence he would not
imitate, had been greatly increased by the
transfer of the sword to him, and by a
parting
4
interview, which he had overheard,
between
him and Frances. Deservedly
surpassed
in his father's affections, and rivalled
in his passionate love, his haughty spirit was
goaded to the utmost. The night he left
them, he swore to his own soul a deep and
sure revenge. He sought the American
camp in the character of a spy; he obtained
access to the barracks of the unsuspicious
William, and seizing the fatal sword, which
had so much embittered his malice, he aimed
a death-blow at his only brother. A struggle
ensued, and William was well nigh proving
victorious, when in the voice of his earlier
years he exclaimed William! The sword
dropped at his feet; he seized it; and
before
his brother had recovered from his
consternation
,
Joseph had gone beyond recall.
This adventure a little softened his
ferocious
nature; and perhaps the dreadful
resolution
he had taken would never have been
kept, had not an American been brought into
the enemy's camp, under the imputation of
carrying important papers to the rebels; but
Frances's letters by these means came into
his hand. Stung to the soul with jealousy
and rage, he again swore the horrid vow.
We have already told how she was
decoyed
into his presence. It matters not what
were the insults and the heart-cutting words
he heaped upon her. It was a shocking
detail
,
and I would fain spare the repetition of
it. Suffice it to say, he talked, with
fiend-like
malignity, of love crossed and ambition
thwarted; he reproached her with broken
promises and disappointed hopes; and when
she refused to pollute her soul with false
vows, he sealed his oath with blood!
William lived to hear the agonized tidings.
He lived, too, again to spare his wicked
brother
,
when his sword flourished over him in
the tumult of battle; but ever after that, he
seemed to rush upon his death. After one
of the sanguinary conflicts which immediately
preceded our independence, he was found
dead in the very centre of the British army.
His father lived to extreme old age, as
happy as the sympathy of his countrymen,
and a firm trust in the Rock of Ages, could
make one who had passed through such a
4A
fiery ordeal. Joseph never saw him after
the death of Frances Leslie; but the
depraved
wretch survived them all; and it is not
many years since he was seen seated on the
road side in Plymouth county, as we
described
him at the commencement of our
story.
YOU 'VE BEEN CAPTAIN LONG
ENOUGH.
As I was walking up Beacon-street, the
other day, I met a little republican corps,
which greatly amused me. The band
consisted
of four boys, from six to ten years of
age, accoutred in childish fashion, with
pasteboard
caps and tin swords. The troop was
merely large enough to furnish captain,
lieutenant
,
ensign, and trumpetera fair epitome
of some of our military establishments.
Being
all of them in office, I very naturally
concluded they were satisfied and happy;
but my eye had not followed the young
soldiers
far, when I perceived the lieutenant (a
sturdy urchin, about six years old,) make a
decided halt. What is the matter, Jack?
called out the captain. I tell you what,
Andrew, you've been captain long enough,
was the reply;I'm going to be captain
now.
Some altercation followed; and the
refractory
4B
lieutenant vociferated still more
loudly, You've been captain long enough
it is my turn now. A compromise was
at length effected; and the ambitious little
rebel agreed to budge a few yards further,
satisfied with the promise of rotation in office
at the end of the street.
I could not refrain from laughing, as the
little pageant moved out of sight. This,
said I, is an abridgement of human society
here is the genuine spirit of man.
That little troop recurs to my memory as
frequently as Franklin thought of his
dearbought
whistle.
When I hear selfish politicians keeping up
an angry clamour about
reform,
I say to
myself, Ha! your troop would be all
officers
;
and even then the most contemptible
among ye would soon prove insubordinate,
and exclaim, I tell you what,
Andrew,
it is
my turn to be captain now.
When I see a lover all devotion, or a young
husband all indulgence, I wonder how long
it will be before he will say, You've been
captain long enough. It is my turn now.
When a blooming young girl asks, Don't
you think Isabel begins to fade? I imagine
her ambitious little heart is whispering, She
has been captain long enough.
When I hear a belle congratulate a
rival
upon her marriage, it sounds to my ear
very much like, It is my turn to be
captain
now.
When I hear writers declare, in a most
oracular tone, that Miss Sedgwick will never
rival her early productions, I am half
tempted to answer, Nay, my friend, she
has not been captain long enough. We must
content ourselves with being lieutenants.
I might mention a hundred things, which
bring the discontented little officer to my
mind; but I forbear, lest my readers should
impatiently exclaim, I tell you what,
you've been captain long enough!
LINES,
OCCASIONED BY HEARING A LITTLE BOY MOCK THE OLD
SOUTH BELL RINGING THE HOUR OF TWELVE.
Aye,
ring thy shout to the merry hours!
Well may ye part in glee!
From their sunny wings they scatter flowers,
And laughing look on thee!
Thy thrilling voice has started tears
It brings to mind the day,
When I chased butterflies and years,
And both flew fast away.
Then my glad thoughts were few and free,
They came but to depart;
They did not ask where heaven could be
'Twas in my little heart.
I since have sought the meteor crown,
Which fame bestows on men
How gladly would I throw it down,
To be so gay again!
But youthful joy has gone away
In vain 'tis now pursued!
Such rainbow glories only stay
Around the simply good.
I know too much to be as blest
As when I was like thee;
My spirit, reason'd into rest,
Has lost its buoyancy.
Yet still I love the winged hours
We often meet in glee;
And sometimes, too, are fragrant flowers
Their farewell gifts to me.
THOUGHTS.
...I have felt
A presence that disturbs me with the joy
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
Of something far more deeply interfused,
Whose dwelling was the light of setting suns,
And the round ocean, and the living air,
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man.
Wordsworth
.
The
day was closing in, and as I sat
watching
the scarcely moving foliage of a
neighbouring
elm, my mind gradually sank into a
state of luxurious repose, amounting to total
unconsciousness of all the busy sights and
sounds of earth.
It seemed to me as if I were seated by a
calm, deep lake, surrounded by graceful and
breezy shrubbery, and listening to most
delicious
music. The landscape differed from
anything I had ever seen. Light seemed to
be in every thing, and to emanate from every
thing, like a glory. Yet I felt
at home;
and
could I see a painting of it, I should know it
as readily as the scenes of my childhood.
And so it is with a multitude of thoughts that
come suddenly into the soul, new as visitants
from farthest Saturn, yet familiar as a
mother's
voice. Whence do they come? Is
Plato's suggestion something more than
poetry
?
Have we indeed formerly lived in a
luminous and shadowless world, where all
things wear light as a garment? And are
our bright and beautiful thoughts but casual
glimpses of that former state? Are all our
hopes and aspirations nothing but
recollections
?
Is it to the fragments of
memory's
broken mirror we owe the thousand fantastic
forms of grandeur, or of loveliness, which
fancy
calls her own?
And the gifted ones, who now and then
blaze upon the world, and darken nations
when they die,do they differ from other
mortals only in more cloudless reminiscences
of their heavenly home?
Or are we living, separate existences, at one
and the same time. Are not our souls
wandering
in the spirit-land while our bodies are
on earth? And when in slumber, or deep
quietude of thought, we cast off `this mortal
coil,' do we not gather up images of reality,
that seem to us like poetry? Might not the
restless spirit of Byron have indeed learned
of archangels ruined those potent words,
which, like infernal magic, arouse every
sleeping demon in the human heart?
Are dreams merely visits to our
spirithome
;
and are we in sleep really talking with
the souls of those whose voice we seem to
hear?
As death approaches and earth recedes,
do we not more clearly see that spiritual
world, in which we have all along been
living
,
though we knew it not? The dying
man tells us of attendant angels hovering
round him. Perchance it is no visionthey
may have often been with him, but his
inward
eye was dim, and he saw them not.
What is that mysterious expression, so holy
and so strange, so beautiful yet so fearful, on
the countenance of one whose soul has just
departed? Is it the glorious light of
attendant
seraphs, the luminous shadow of which
rests awhile on the countenance of the dead?
Does infancy owe to this angel crowd its
peculiar
power to purify and bless?
Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nakedness,
But trailing clouds of glory do we come
From God, who is our home:
Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
LA ROSIERE:
OR, THE TRIUMPH OF GOODNESS.
Loving she is, and tractable, though wild;
And innocence hath privilege in her
To dignify arch looks and laughing eyes.
Wordsworth
.
In
France there is an old and very
graceful
custom, called the fete of la Rosiere. On
this occasion those in authority publicly
present
a garland of roses to the best and most
beautiful girl in the village. This custom
had its origin deep in national feeling and
true morality; but, alas! wheresoever
human
passion can creep in, they leave their
slime upon the roses of lifethe fete of la
Rosiere, like other triumphs, too often
becomes
an affair of jealous rivalry and petty
intrigue.
Angelique Duroy was one of the very
prettiest of her bewitching countrywomen.
Her clear, dark eye was neither flashing nor
languidit had a quiet, deep expression,
brilliant yet thoughtful; her complexion
inclined
to olive; but the perpetual colour that
mantled there, gave her cheek the tempting
ripeness of tropical fruit; while the laughing
dimples on either side came and went, like
whirlpools in a sunny stream. Every thing
in her look and motion argued an exuberance
of life and happiness. Her voice had the
clear, gushing melody of the thrush, her
little nimble graceful feet made one think of
a swallow just ready to take wing; and
altogether
she was so small, so airy, so pretty,
so gay, and so musical, that I am sure if
ner soul transmigrates, it will pass into a
yellow-bird, or a Java-sparrow.
The young men all admired Angelique,
because she was so lady-like and unaffected;
the old people loved her because she was
such a good child to her parents, and always
so kind and respectful to the agedwhile the
children, when asked, were always ready to
say, We love Angelique best, because she
is always so good-natured and obliging, and
she knows how to make us so many pretty
things. Indeed, Angelique was famous for
her ingenuity and industry. After
examining
anything, she always found out how to
do it without being taught; and what she
did, she always did well. The prettiest
dresses and bonnets in the village were made
by her; and her artificial flowers were so
natural, that I think the very honey-bees
would have been deceived by them. Some
told her if she went to Paris she would make
a fortune by her ingenuity; but Angelique
blushed, and said she had rather live with
her good mother, than grow rich among
strangers.
It is strange this artless little French girl
should have enemies; for she never had an
uncommonly pretty cap, or garland, that she
was not perfectly willing to make her young
companions one just like it; but great gifts,
if borne ever so meekly, do excite envy
Angelique had her enemies. The daughter
of the Maire of the village was eight or nine
years older than Angelique; and she never
from her childhood had been either pretty,
or amiable. She was very rich, very idle,
very haughty, and very jealous. It vexed
her that her fairy neighbour, unadorned, save
by her own tasteful industry, should be so
much more admired than she was, with all
her jewelry and Parisian finery. Besides,
she had long been in love with the son of a
wealthy proprietaire; and this young man,
when urged by his father to make suit to so
great an heiress, openly declared that his
affections were engaged to Angelique. This
made the father very angryhe called it a
boyish passion. Antoinette is the only
child of the Maire, and he has immense
wealth and high character; will you give up
such an union, when father and daughter both
evidently wish for it, merely for the sake of
a pretty plaything, a giddy little butterfly,
like Angelique Duroy? said he.
The young man insisted that Angelique
was as good as she was pretty; that she was
capable, industrious, modest, and
noble-hearted
As
a proof of it, contined he,
every one in the village, except Antoinette,
says the Cure will crown her at the fete of
la Rosiere.
The proprietaire was a kind-hearted, wise,
old man; his neighbours called him odd,
but his oddity was always of a benevolent
kind. Well, Jacques, said he, if the
girl has so many good qualities, besides her
pretty looks, I won't be obstinate about being
convinced. I know Angelique has resolutely
refused to receive any attention from you
without the knowledge and approbation of
her mother and myselfthis speaks well
but how do you know that the young lady
will smile upon your suit?
Jacques looked down, blushed very
slightly
,
hesitatedthen looked up with an arch
look, and said, If she knew you gave your
approbation, I, at least, might
try
.
The old man smiledWell, well, said
he, I see how it is. The girl, though not
rich, is highly respectable. I will attend the
fete of la Rosiere; you shall dance with the
crowned fair one; and if I think she deserves
this distinction, Angelique shall be to me as
a daughter.
Jacques knelt down and kissed his father's
hand with overflowing gratitude. He had
not expected to gain his point so easily;
for he knew his father had very much set his
heart upon joining his estates to those of the
Maire. You are the best father in the
world! exclaimed he.
You
call me so
Jacquesthe world will say I am an old fool;
but after all, what do we live for, if not for
happiness?
Away went the young man, in the fullness
of his joy, to impart the tidings to Angelique;
and she, above all petty coquetry, heard it
with unaffected delight.
The fete of la Rosiere was anxiously
awaited
.
Every body so often repeated that
Angelique would certainly be crowned, for
she was
la plus belle et la plus bonne,
that
modest as she was, she could not help
expecting
it. The important day cameand
who do you think was crowned?
Antoinette
,
the ugly, idle daughter of the Maire!
she was crowned the best and most beautiful!
The Maire gave a great ball that night.
Angelique went; for she was above showing
any resentment. She saw Jacques dancing
with la Rosiereshe saw that his father
5
observed her closely; and though she could
not be gay, she was cheerful and dignified.
Antoinette whispered to her companions,
See what bold airs she puts on: I should
think she would be mortified, when she and
all her friends have been boasting that she
would be crowned. The old proprietaire
heard one or two such speeches as this, and
he shook his head expressively. He
disappeared
from the room a short time; while he
was gone, his sister, a maiden lady, came up
to Angelique: My dear child, said she,
there is something wrong about this affair
all the village said you would be crowned.
My friends flattered me, said Angelique,
modestly; I knew they thought more
highly
of me than I deserved. But think of
crowning Antoinette! continued the lady
Such an ugly, sluttish thing as she is!
Her dress is very becoming, said
Angelique
;
and I think she is the best dancer
in the room: the tears came to her eyes as
she said this; for Jacques was again dancing
with la Rosiere, and her garland of
Provence
roses was very beautiful.
Angelique retired very early that night,
not without a kind look from Jacques, and an
expression of benevolent approbation from
the old proprietaire and his maiden sister.
As soon as she reached her own little
bedroom
,
she knelt down, and bursting into tears,
prayed that all envious and repining thoughts
might be subdued within her heart. The
prayer proved to be a strength and a
consolation
;
and she soon sunk to sleep as sweetly
as an infant.
Jacques came the next day. He was loud
in his complaints. He said the whole village
was indignant about it. Much good might
the crown of roses do Miss Antoinette!
Nobody
thought she deserved it. He knew
one thing, the Maire had given the Cure a
splendid suit of clothes just before the fete;
and he himself had seen Antoinette's
diamond
ring on his finger. No wonder the
Cure gave the crown to a rich man's
daughter
.
Nay, I do not think the Cure could
do so wrong as to take bribes from anybody,
replied Angelique; and I beg you will not
say so. All the village think so, replied
5A
Jacques; and they always will think so. I
danced with her, because my father said it
would give offence if I did not, on such an
occasion; but I will never dance with her
again. I am sure she is one of the best
dancers I ever saw, answered Angelique.
Nothing soothed by her gentleness, Jacques
went away more indignant than ever, that so
good a girl should be thus wronged.
A week or two after, a great ball was
given
by the proprietaire. He himself called
to invite Angelique; and in the intervening
time, hardly a day passed without his
spending
an hour or two at her parent's dwelling.
The more he saw of her, the more he was
convinced that she was a good girl, and
worthy
of his son. When the evening of the
ball arrived, Angelique and her family were
received at his large mansion with
distinguished
kindness. Before the dancing
begins, I have a whim to be gratified, said
the kind-hearted, but eccentric old man.
There was a universal hum of assent among
the assembly; for the wealthy old landlord
was very popular; and a proposition of his
could at any time be carried by acclamation
in the village. The old gentleman smiled,
and holding up a wreath of roses and
orange-buds
,
he said, There were once two Popes
in the church; why should there not be two
crowned la Rosiere? As he spoke, he
placed the garland on the head of Angelique.
I crown her, because I have proved that
she cannot be tempted to speak ill of a rival,
said he; the roses are my own gift,the
orange-buds came from a younger hand.
Angelique blushed crimson; for orange-buds
form the
bridal
wreath in France. She
looked up timidly; Jacques was at her side,
the music struck up C'est l' amour, l'
amour
,
and the exulting lover led her to the
dance amid the applauses of the guests.
Angelique afterwards found that the good
maiden lady had been instructed to try her
generosity, and that the father of Jacques
had been a concealed listener to her replies.
Antoinette was not invited to the
proprietaire's
ball. He said he had learned
instances
of her art and selfishness, which had
destroyed all esteem for her; but that he
5B
would not openly insult her by the triumph
of one she had always tried to injure.
Soon after, Angelique actually wore the
white veil and the orange-buds, to the village
church; and the Maire and his daughter left
a place where they had never been popular,
and now were odious. By the influence of
the proprietaire, a new Cure was appointed
before the next fete of la Rosiere.
ADDRESS TO THE VALENTINE
PAINTED BY W. ALLSTON, IN THE POSSESSION OF
GEORGE TICKNOR, ESQ.
What
are thy thoughts, thou placid one?
Thy glance is mild as evening sun;
Holy and bright the lucid beam,
As love and hope were in thy dream.
Calm are thy feelingsstill and deep
As seraph's joy, or infant's sleep.
Not thine the British Sappho's eye,
[1]
[1]
L. E. L.
With love's volcano blazing high:
Flush'd cheek and passion-stricken brow,
Are not for one so pure as thou;
Thou 'rt not a thing all smiles and tears,
Wasting thy soul in hopes and fears;
Yet thou, sweet maiden, can'st not hide
Affection's deep and noiseless tide.
A sadden'd hue is on thy cheek
Thy thoughtful look is still and meek;
And well I know that young Love flings
A shadow from his purple wings.
'Tis sad to think life's sunlight gleam
May leave thee, like a morning dream.
Can brows so gentle and so fair,
Be early mark'd by with'ring care?
Ah! listen to the plaintive tone
O'er all Felicia's

Mrs. Hemans.
music thrown!
Heaven spare thee the thrilling sigh,
That wakes her harp to melody!
There's subtle power in every line
Of that bewitching Valentine;
If once within the throbbing heart,
Nor time, nor change, bids it depart,
And seldom it's a quiet guest,
In woman's fond, devoted breast.
New thoughts may fire the weary brain,
But hearts, once chill'd, ne'er warm again.
Yet, lady, trust the dang'rous boy!
His smiles are full of light and joy;
And e'en his most envenom'd dart,
Is better than a vacant heart.
THE BLESSED INFLUENCE OF THE
STUDIES OF NATURE.
Thou shalt see and hear
The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible
Of that eternal language, which thy God
Utters, who from eternity doth teach
Himself in all, and all things in himself.
Great universal Teacher! He shall mould
Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask.
Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee.
Coleridge
.
Stand
out of my sunshine! said
Diogenes
to Alexander, when the emperor asked
what service he could render him. Haughty
as the philosopher's reply may sound, it
merely expresses the honest independence,
which every highly cultivated and well
balanced
mind may feel towards those, who
possess nothing better than the accidental
distinctions of rank or fortune. He indeed
deserves our pity, who needs the
condescending
smile of the proud, or the heartless
flattery of the vain, either to rouse him to
exertion, or warm him into happiness.
The power of self-excitement is the most
desirable of all attainments, and it is the
most rare. To love knowledge merely for
its usefulnessto form and strengthen
virtuous
dispositions, with the hope of no other
reward than the deep tranquillity they bring
is a task achieved by few; yet it is the only
simple and direct road to lasting happiness.
He who can find intellectual excitement in
the fall of an apple, or the hues of a wild
flower, may well say to the officious world,
Stand out of my sunshine! To him
Nature
is an open volume, where truths of the
loftiest import are plainly written; and the
temptations and anxieties of this life have no
power to cast a shadow on its broad and
beautiful pages.
I do not mean that solitude is bliss, even
where enjoyment is of the purest kind. An
eminence, that places us above the hopes and
fears, the joys and sorrows of social life,
must indeed be an unenviable one; but that
which puts us beyond the reach of the
ever-varying
tide of circumstance and opinion, is
surely desirable; and nothing on which the
mind can be employed tends so much to
produce
this state of internal sunshine, as the
study of Nature in her various forms.
Politics, love of gain, ambition of renown,
every thing, in short, which can be acted
upon by the passions of mankind,have a
corroding influence on the human soul. But
Nature, ever majestic and serene, moves on
with the same stately step and beaming
smile, whether a merchantman is wrecked,
or an empire overthrown. The evils of
man's heart pollute all with which they can
be incorporated; but they cannot defile
her
holy temple. The doors are indeed closed
against the restless and the bad; but the
radiant
goddess is ever at the altar, willing to
smile upon all who are pure enough to love
her quiet beauty.
Ambition may play a mighty gameit
may task the sinews of nations, and make
the servile multitude automaton dancers to
its own stormy music; but sun, and moon,
and stars, go forth on their sublime mission,
independent of its power; and its utmost
efforts cannot change the laws which
produce
the transient glory of the rainbow.
Avarice may freeze the genial current of
affection, and dry up all the springs of
sympathy
within the human soul; but it cannot
diminish the pomp of summer, or restrain
the prodigality of autumn.
Fame may lead us on in pursuit of
glittering
phantoms, until the diseased mind
loses all relish for substantial good; but it
cannot share the eternity of light, or the
immortality
of the minutest atom.
He who has steered his bark, ever so
skilfully
,
through the sea of politics, rarely, if
ever, finds a quiet haven. His vexations
and his triumphs have all been of an exciting
character; they have depended on outward
circumstances, over which he had very
limited
power; and when the turbulent scene
has passed away, he finds, too late, that he
has lived on the breath of others, and that
happiness has no home within his heart.
And what is the experience of him who
has existed only for wealth? who has safely
moored his richly-freighted vessel in the
spacious
harbour of successful commerce?
Does he find that happiness can, like
modern
love, be bought with gold? You may
see him hurrying about to purchase it in
small quantities, wherever the exhibitions of
taste and talent offer it for sale; but the
article
is too ethereal to be baled for future
use, and it soon evaporates amid the
emptiness
of his intellectual warehouse.
He that lives only for fame, will find that
happiness and renown are scarcely speaking
acquaintance. Even if he could catch the
rainbow he has so eagerly pursued, he would
find its light fluctuating with each changing
sunbeam, and fading at the touch of every
passing cloud.
Nor is he who has wasted the energies
of his youth in disentangling the knotty skein
of controversy, more likely to find the
evening
of his days serene and tranquil. The
demon of dogmatism, or of doubt, may have
grappled him closely, and converted his early
glow of feeling, and elasticity of thought,
into rancorous prejudice, or shattered faith.
But the deep streams of quiet thought and
pure philosophy gush forth abundantly from
all the hiding-places of Nature; there is no
drop of bitterness at the fountain; the clear
waters reflect none of the Proteus forms of
human pride; and ever, as they flow, their
peaceful murmurs speak of heaven.
The enjoyment that depends on powerful
excitement saps the strength of manhood,
and leaves nothing for old age but discontent
and desolation. Yet we need amusements
in the decline of life, even more than in its
infancy; and where shall we find any so
safe, satisfactory, and dignified, as battery
and barometer, telescope and prism?
Electric power may be increased with less
danger than man's ambition; it is far safer
to weigh the air than a neighbour's motives;
it is more disquieting to watch tempests
lowering in the political horizon, than it is to
gaze at volcanoes in the moon; and it is
much easier to separate and unite the colours
in a ray of light, than it is to blend the
many-coloured hues of truth, turned out of
their course by the sharp corners of angry
controversy.
Finally, he who drinks deeply at the
fountain
of natural science, will reflect the
cheerfulness
of his own spirit on all things around.
If the sympathy of heart and mind be within
his reach, he will enjoy it more keenly than
other men; and if solitude be his portion, he
can, in the sincerity of a full and pious mind,
say to all the temptations of fame and
pleasure
,
Stand ye out of my sunshine!
THE RECLUSE OF THE LAKE.
Man and boy,
He'd been an idler in the land,
Contented if he might enjoy
The things that others understand.
Wordsworth
.
In
the immediate vicinity of Lake George
there was, a few years since, an humble
dwelling, which always attracted the
traveller's
attention, though there was nothing
peculiar
about it, save a rich sloping greensward
in front, and a luxuriant honeysuckle, which
almost concealed the door, and loaded the
air with its fragance.
A stranger would have supposed that
woman's
tasteful hand had been there, adorning
poverty itself with wreathed smiles; but
seldom had her foot pressed the verdant
velvet
of that turf, and no female hand trained
the graceful tendrils of that exuberant vine.
The romantic little spot was the solitary
home of Arthur Vanderlyn, an artist and a
poet! No chilling disappointment, no
embittered
misanthropy, occasioned his
retirement
from the world. He never indulged
that false idea, so shameful to intellect, that
the powerful tide of genius must necessarily
be turbid and restless. In him, it was a
clear, deep, sunny stream, reflecting all of
bright and beautiful in earth, or heaven; but
his nature was timid, and he shrank from the
ostentation of learning, the pageantry of
wealth, and the officiousness of vulgarity, as
things which could neither obtain his
sympathy
,
nor endurance. The Recluse was the
only son of a wealthy Batavian merchant,
who had sent him to New-England to be
educated.
His mother had died when he was a mere
babe; and his father carefully concealed
from him the amount of his large fortune,
lest the knowledge should early lead him to
extravagance and dissipation. This
well-founded
anxiety induced him to make a very
singular arrangement in the disposal of his
wealth.
Arthur Vanderlyn was nineteen years old
when he quitted the University; and on that
day, he received tidings of his father's death,
and became acquainted with the contents of
his will.
Fifteen thousand dollars were to be paid
him immediately; twenty thousand more,
when he was thirty years of age; and his
whole fortune, without reserve, on his
forty-fifth
birthday; but, in case one hundred
dollars were ever borrowed in advance, his
title was to be transferred to a distant
relative
.
Limited as this income was, compared to
what it would have been, if left to the
ordinary
course of law, the young student thought
it amply sufficient to accomplish all his
favourite
projects.
After travelling in New-York a few weeks,
he purchased the cottage we have
mentioned
,
then almost in a ruinous condition. He
made no very important change in the
exterior
of the dwelling; but within, carpets,
ottomans, vases, and mirrors, proclaimed a
wealthy and tasteful resident. His own
portrait, distinguished by its strong, bold,
peculiar light; views of the surrounding
scenerysome wild and fearful enough for
the pencil of Salvator Rosa, and others,
calm, sequestered, and luxuriant, as the spots
over which Claude loved to throw his bland,
warm colouring;a guitar, piano, four or five
fine flutes, and a time-piece, of Genevan
workmanship, in which the hours with winged
feet flew round, offering rose-wreaths to each
other; all served to give the interior of the
mansion something of the magic beauty of
fairy land.
The neighbours made various ingenious
attempts to explore a place, of which many
a wonderful tale was told; but Arthur
Vanderlyn
avoided all society with a coldness
and hauteur, which at once excited curiosity
and forbade intrusion. A stud of noble
horses, a leash of beautiful greyhounds, a
fine collection of birds, and one favourite
man servant, were his only companions.
Yet his disposition was kind, and his
feelings
social. The buzzing of insects, the
twittering
of birds, and the ringing laughter of
childhood, filled him with delightful
sensations
.
6
Much of religion, too, entered into his
lonely musings; for he read more on earth's
fair volume than philosophy has ever
dreamed of. To the pure in heart, the
glad melody of Nature's voice always speaks
of heaven; and her beaming face reflects
much of truth, as well as poetry, on the quiet
stream of thought. There is no place where
her silent eloquence comes upon the soul so
much like celestial music, felt, but not heard,
as from the crystal depths of placid Lake
George. There is, as it were, a holiness
attached to it, heightened by the recollection
that for years a mighty, but declining,
priesthood
,
resorted to this baptismal font of the
wilderness, to trace their emblem of
mysterious
faith on the pure brow of infancy; and
we feel, as we gaze upon it, that Lake of
the Holy Sacrament was a fitting name for
waters so lucid and so tranquil. Here, at
rising and setting sun, might the Recluse be
seen, guiding his boat among the numerous
Emerald Isles, and dipping his oar almost
fearfully, as if he loved not to disturb the
sleeping beauty of the scene; and, hour after
hour, the light skiff was moored at Diamond
Isle, while its wayward owner skipped
pebbles
in the stream, or searched for the
far-famed
crystals concealed among the clefts.
There was one poor hut upon the island, but
Vanderlyn had never entered it. His
servant
told him that the old crone who resided
there, for the purpose of selling diamonds to
travellers, was noted for her asperity of
temper
;
and the fastidious refinement of the
young artist, always recoiling from everything
discordant, induced him to avoid this
dwelling
with more than ordinary caution. The
first time he unconsciously approached nearer
than usual, he was warned of it by the
sharpest
voice he ever heard. As he turned his
head, he saw that the old woman was
scolding
a delicate-looking boy, who was
endeavouring
to draw a small boat to the place
her finger indicated. Vanderlyn, disgusted
at the contest, was about to retire abruptly,
when a reply came upon his ear in tones so
soft and undulating, that it seemed more like
aerial music than any human voice.
The speaker was a young girl, whose dress,
6A
plain and coarse as it was, betrayed much of
that simple gentility, which often appears
instinctive in woman. Her face was of
uncommon
and very peculiar beauty. A
profusion
of light brown hair drooping about her
neck, and the deep fringe which veiled her
large blue eyes, gave the upper part of her
face an expression of pathetic, almost of
melancholy
,
loveliness; but her fair dimpled
cheek, and her laughing lip, rising at one
corner in most captivating archness, seemed
like sunshine bursting beneath a summer
cloud, and rapidly chasing away its shadow.
Her figure, though slender and graceful,
possessed
the full round outline of perfect health.
Had it been embodied in statuary, one would
have imagined the sculptor had half finished
a Psyche, when Hebe came bounding along
his path, and fascinated him from his
purpose
.
Vanderlyn had always shunned the
society of women; but his fancy, cultivated
as it was to excess, had conjured up many a
romantic vision of love and beauty. Years
of total seclusion would probably have
rendered
a less enthusiastic temperament than
his susceptible of sudden passion; therefore,
though timidity induced him to retire hastily,
it is not surprising that the fair being, so
unexpectedly seen, should seem to more than
realize his youthful dreams. As he watched
the boat which conveyed her from the shore,
he soon perceived that the boy had great
difficulty in managing it. Experience had
made him thoroughly acquainted with the
navigation of Lake George; and he knew
that it was frequently rendered dangerous by
powerful under-currents, the irregularity of
which puzzle the ablest pilots. They are
probably occasioned by winds rushing from
caverns in the earth; for the waters of the
lake are often billowy, when not a leaflet is
stirring on its shores. Vanderlyn, while
waiting for it to subside, had sometimes
compared
it to the human mind, fretting and
foaming from the contradictory influence of
its own strong passions, till the calm majesty
of Nature could leave no image there; but
he did not now waste time in poetic reverie.
With sudden impulse, he sprang into his own
light skiff; and before the object of his pur
6B
suit had reached the middle of the lake, he
was at her side, urging her to trust herself to
his skilful guidance. The astonished girl
blushed exceedingly. She had heard much
of the Recluse of the Lake, and she knew
that his present graciousness of manner was
very extraordinary. However, terror
overcame
her bashfulness; and she told her little
brother, if the boats could be fastened
together
,
she should be much obliged to the
stranger gentleman for setting them on shore.
The proposal seemed to relieve the boy
from much anxiety; and he evinced his
gratitude
by the most assiduous attention to
their conductor.
Vanderlyn and his companion were both
eager to speak; but embarrassment kept
them silent, and gave their interview the
appearance
of a cold, accidental encounter.
However, as the boat was safely drawn up
to the margin of the lake, and the young
lady
thanked him for his prompt assistance,
she could not fail to remark the delighted
expression of his eye; and the boy was
surprised
by an earnest invitation to visit the
hermitage the ensuing day. Never did
impatient
childhood watch for to-morrow with
such keen anticipation. The lad could
scarcely believe that he was indeed invited
into that abode of hidden magnificence; and
when the remarkable event had in reality
happened, he could hardly detail its
particulars
to his sister, so great was the delirium
of his joy and wonder. Oh, Mary!
exclaimed
he, you don't know, and you can't
guess anything about it. I never was in such
a place in all my life. He is n't proud; Mr.
Vanderlyn isn't proud, as they say he is.
You don't know how good he was, and how
many questions he asked about you. He
gave me the handsomest bird-cage in the
whole world, and the handsomest bird in it;
and he said that I was such a fine boy he
must send me to College. I told him your
name was Mary Campbell; and that our
father
was dead; and that we used to be better
off than we are now; and that the woman at
Diamond Isle was not our own grandmother,
only father's mother-in-law; that we did not
live there, but had leave to stay a few weeks
till we could get good places out at service.
But you should not have told him that,
George, interrupted his sister. And why
not, when he asked me every word? said
the boy. Mary Campbell could hardly
answer
to her own heart, why Arthur
Vanderlyn
should not be acquainted with her place
of residence, as well as her utter poverty.
She knew little of a sinful world; but she
had read in books that the poor maiden has
much to dread from the rich man's love; and
when she recalled the deference of the
stranger's
manner, and the beaming expression of
his eye, as he bade her farewell, she
shuddered
,
and even wept, that things so
pleasant
to memory should be so dangerous.
Could she have looked into Vanderlyn's
heart, her fears would have vanished. His
love was indeed wild and vehement, but it
was guileless as infant thought. It was a
poet's dream, never to be realized by
imperfect
humanity; but it originated in pure and
honourable feeling, and might easily be
changed to something better and more
permanent
than the illusive delights of an
overheated
imagination.
From the moment Mr. Vanderlyn heard
George Campbell's story, he resolved to
educate
both him and his sister for that higher
grade of society, which beauty and talent so
well fitted them to adorn. After two days'
reflection upon the subject, he visited
Diamond
Isle for the purpose of making his
intentions
known. His repeated summons at
the door of the hut, were answered by the
old woman, who, showing a face squalid as
disease and poverty could make it, shrilly
demanded his business. Is Miss
Campbell
here? inquired her shrinking visiter.
Yes, was the laconic reply. May I see
her? No, that you mayn't, sir,
answered
the beldame fiercely; and, adding a
torrent
of abuse, which we forbear to repeat,
she shut and fastened the door with all
possible
violence.
Her loathsome appearance, and the angry
coarseness of her language, were a powerful
antidote to the romance of benevolence and
love; and for several days Vanderyn
cherished
the idea that one connected with such
a woman must be tinged with her vulgarity
as well as ignorance. Nursed in the lap of
luxury, the poet made no allowance for the
corroding influence of poverty; and innocent
of all wicked intentions, he could not believe
the grandmother's harshness originated in
kind and judicious watchfulness; but the
more reluctant he felt again to encounter the
virago of the island, the more his curiosity
increased with regard to the pretty stranger.
He was revolving these thoughts in his
mind late one summer's afternoon, when he
saw Mary and her brother passing swiftly by,
as if they wished to reach home before the
twilight closed. He instantly joined them,
and urged them to walk in to look at the
birds and flowers. The girl's modest No,
I thank you, was uttered in a tone so mild,
he could not think it a very firm refusal; but
when he repeated his request, she replied,
with something of indignant decision, No,
I thank you, sir. It is quite time we were at
Diamond Isle. The Recluse perceived he
was distrusted, and his cheek glowed with
honest indignation at the thought; but he
bowed low, as he added, Pardon the
improper
request; and allow me to make some
slight atonement for my rashness. He
darted into the house, and soon returned with
a large, beautiful boquet. George cast back
many a lingering look; but Mary had
walked on so fast, that it was difficult to
overtake her. She was, however, evidently
pleased with the respectful manner in which
the flowers were offered; and, before they
proceeded far, she even ventured to repeat
the fine accounts her brother had given.
Yes, exclaimed the light-hearted boy,
it was every word true. My cage is the
handsomest in the whole world, and has the
handsomest bird in it; and Mr. Vanderlyn's
house is the handsomest in the whole world,
and What a pity, interrupted the
smiling Recluse, that
my
handsome cage
has not the handsomest bird in the whole
world in it. You could never find a
prettier
bird than mine at Diamond Isle, replied
the artless boy. I believe it, rejoined
his friend; and he looked and spoke so
significantly, that Mary's cheek burned with
blushes, while honest George in vain
perplexed
his mind with conjectures whether Mr.
Vanderlyn wished to have his bird back again.
When they reached the lake, the Recluse
made a motion to accompany them; but
Miss Campbell said, with evident
embarrassment
,
I had rather you would not go with
us. Indeed I had much rather you would
not. The shade of vexation and
disappointment
,
which passed over his speaking
countenance, troubled the gentle girl; and
she turned back to add, with the most
bewitching
artlessness, I did not mean that
I
had rather not have you go. It would be
very pleasant indeed to
me;
butbut
indeed
,
you had better go back, Mr.
Vanderlyn
.
I will return to please you,
sweet girl, exclaimed the delighted lover.
Farewell, till you hear from me again.
She is not tinged with vulgarity, thought
he, as he retraced his steps homeward. She
has delicacy a thousand times more refined
their artificial dignity can ever imitate.
Under the influence of recent excitement, he
wrote to offer her his hand, his heart, and his
fortune. In his letter, he proposed adopting
her brother; begged leave to defray the
expenses
of one year's education for herself;
and voluntarily promised to make no attempt
to see her during that time, if it were
unpleasant
to her. Such delicacy and
generosity
might well have won the proudest and
coldest heart; but the desolate and
affectionate
Mary Campbell was entirely overpowered
by it; and, in the enthusiasm of her gratitude,
she thought it honour and happiness enough
for her to be Arthur Vanderlyn's slave, to
watch his motions, and obey his every signal.
George wondered at the emotion his sister
evinced, and when he was told the letter was
from Mr. Vanderlyn, his first sorrowful idea
was that the bird must be returned; but,
when he was made to comprehend that his
new friend had offered to educate him, and
marry his sister, he could not control his
feelings. After kissing Mary a hundred
times, and crying and laughing alternately,
he rushed out of the house, and, before his
absence was noticed, he was in his
benefactor's
dwelling. The eloquent speech he
had prepared to say, forsook him the
moment
the Recluse met him with one of his
winning smiles. He burst into tears, and
exclaimed
,
You are too good, sir, indeed you
are too good; and we all love you so
much! Then you and Mary will go to
school, for my sake? inquired the visionary.
Oh, it is such a blessing to go! rejoined
the poor boy; and then if it was'nt, we
would do any thing and every thing for you.
I wish you could have seen Mary cry over
your letter, and heard how often she said that
you were the best man in the whole world.
Though the poet's life had been more like
a fairy dream, than usually falls to the lot
of mortals, he had never known true
happiness
before. Many and valuable are the
boasted delights of intellect and taste, but
one moment of the heart's bliss is worth
them all. So at least thought Arthur
Vanderlyn
,
when a simple, affectionate letter from
Mary, thanked him for his goodness, and
expressed
her entire confidence in his integrity.
The brother and sister were both placed at
excellent schools; and though Arthur was
for a season separated from the object so
suddenly become necessary to his existence,
yet her frequent unstudied letters, showed
that he was beloved with that mingled
reverence
and self-devotion so dear to the heart
of man.
In the mean time a cloud, which the young
enthusiast had not foreseen, was gradually
spreading over his sunshine of prosperity and
joy. Like Shenstone, he had surrounded
himself with luxurious elegance, to which his
funds were inadequate. Strange as it may
seem, for one educated in America, he had
an eye and a soul for all the beauties of
statues
,
pictures, and exotics, without the habit
of counting their cost. The result was, his
fifteen thousand were gone, twice over, before
he was aware of it. His creditors were
impatient
;
six years must still elapse before he
received another portion of his wealth; his
trustees warned him against borrowing the
forbidden sum; and no resource remained,
but the sale of his beautiful cottage. Unused
as the Recluse was to all the rankling cares
of life, this alternative went like a dagger to
his sensitive heart. However, he resolved
to support Mary and George at all events,
even if he were compelled to personal
exertion
.
Accordingly, a day was appointed,
and the retreat, with all its elegant
appendages
,
was sold at public auction. Much
curiosity
was excited, and crowds assembled to
witness the sale. A tall, dignified,
middle-aged
gentleman, appeared to take an
extraordinary
interest in all that was passing. He
asked innumerable questions concerning the
character and habits of Vanderlyn; doubled
what was last offered for any article, however
extravagant the price; and left the spot
undisputed
master of the whole establishment.
In this way, a much larger sum was obtained
than his creditors had expected; and, after
every debt was honourably discharged, the
Recluse found that rigid economy would
enable
him still to support himself and the
orphans. His first impulse was to thank the
generous unknown; but he had much of that
unbending pride, too often the fault of genius,
and he could not endure the idea that he
owed his present security to the compassion
of a stranger. An honest spirit of
independence
was stirred within him, and for the first
time in his life he thought of the productions
of his pencil as a means of future support.
Among other unfinished views, he had a
favorite one, which represented Mary
Campbell
as he had first seen her stepping into
the boat at Diamond Isle. He had ceased
to visit that island, together with many a
beloved
haunt, during his recent distress; but
he now resolved to take his canvass to the
picturesque spot where he had first sketched
its outlines. As he approached the margin
of the lake, and saw his boat pushing off
from the shore, the painful recollection that
it was no longer his own, crowded upon him.
He made a signal to the bargeman, which
was instantly obeyed; and in the
embarrassment
of offering money for a passage to
Diamond
Isle, he did not at first notice that the
stately unknown was already a passenger.
The haughty Recluse would gladly have
retreated; but the gentleman ordered the
boat to be drawn up for his accommodation,
and with the most friendly politeness urged
him to enter. I am a stranger here, Mr.
Vanderlyn, said he; and I hear that you
have an artist's eye and a poet's tongue. I
should really like to share this romantic
prospect with you. He spoke with a
slightly foreign accent; and his manner was
so fascinating, that Vanderlyn could not
decline
the invitation.
It was a clear, bright, autumnal day. The
lake shone beneath the sinking sun like liquid
amber; the little green islands seemed to
smile at their own shadows; the distant
mountains threw an almost imperceptible
outline on the cloudless sky; and the rugged
peaks which surrounded the lake, looked
down upon it in stern and lofty majesty.
Thus inclosed, the fair sheet of water, so
pellucid
and motionless, looked like a lovely
babe sleeping at the feet of steel-clad
warriors
,
enjoying its dream of peace, all
unconscious
of their frowns.
The gentlemen had not long admired the
beautiful sublimity of the scene, when a cloud
of dingy white was observed gathering around
the summit of Rattlesnake Mountain. At
first, it was thin and shadowy, as the vapour
which enveloped Samuel when he rose at the
summons of the sorceress; but it gradually
accumulated, like the soiled plumes of a
regiment rushing from the battle-field in
confusion
and dismay.
Is that an omen of an approaching
thunder
shower? inquired the stranger. It
forbodes a sudden and a dreadful one,
replied
Vanderlyn, speaking low, and keeping
his eye fixed upon the mountain. The
bargeman rowed with almost supernatural
strength; and the quick, convulsive heavings
of his breath had a fearful sound amid the
stillness of the coming storm.
Long before they could reach Diamond
Isle, the sky was covered with one deep,
black mantle of clouds; the lake was dimpled
by the falling rain, and illumined with forked
lightning; and the thunder rolled from
mountain
to mountain, ever and anon bursting out
in echoing peals, as if the spirits of the air
shouted their far-off warnings to each other
7
The scene was too terrific in its majesty
for even the poet to enjoy; for an instinctive
dread of thunder was one of his peculiarities.
Row faster, bargeman, and avoid the
current
,
were the only words he uttered; but
his eye changed its wonted flash of
inspiration
for the intense light of fear.
The boat cut the black waves rapidly, and,
amid the uproar of the elements, they landed
in safety. Without waiting for their hasty
summons to be answered, Vanderlyn entered
the wretched hut of Mrs. Campbell. The
old woman, crouching in the corner, seemed
to rejoice at the sight of a human being. I
have lived here twenty long years, said she;
but never have I seen a storm like this.
Few words were spoken by the gentlemen,
as they watched the clouds heavily and
reluctantly
dispersing. Nearly an hour
elapsed
,
before a speck of clear blue sky looked
forth, like a seraph stilling the tempest; but
the sun at length shone out in its glory,
making the grass glitter with transient pearls,
and showing every spider's web studded with
diamonds, fit for the regalia of a fairy queen.
The light entered a small window, and shone
obliquely upon an embroidered genealogical
tree, which immediately attracted the
stranger's
attention. Fixing his eye upon it for
an instant, he exclaimed, James Mac
Ferguson
!
was he a relation of your's, ma'am?
He was father to my husband's first wife,
answered the woman. Has he any heirs
living? Yes, there are two great
grandchildren
,
George and Mary Campbell; but
it is precious little they'll be heir to, I guess.
George and Mary Campbell, repeated the
stranger, as if talking to himself. Did I
not hear He paused, and looked
inquiringly
at Vanderlyn; who, blushing
slightly
,
replied, If you have heard that I am
educating the young lady, and intend to
marry her, you have heard the truth. The
unknown glanced his eye round the miserable
dwelling. A frown flitted over his brow for
an instant; but it passed away, as he added,
half audibly, Well, she is beautiful and
virtuous, I am told. How can you support
her, young man? continued he, aloud.
Recent circumstances rushed at once upon
7A
the mind of the Recluse. His blood boiled
with indignation at the unfeeling question;
and he answered haughtily, By the
exertion
of my talents, sir. My mind is my
kingdom
.
It is nobly said, rejoined the
stranger. When romance leads us to be
useless, it is not without sin. Have you any
papers belonging to James Mac Ferguson?
continued he, turning toward Mrs. Campbell,
There are some writings in that
case-of-drawers
,
she replied, which my old man
would never have burned. Will you
trust Mr. Vanderlyn and myself to look at
them? Folks that know Mr Vanderlyn,
trust him with any thing, rejoined the old
woman. I would not trust him when he
was rich, but I will now.
The young man looked gratefully at her;
for he loved to remember what had softened
her stern heart towards him. The papers
were produced with alacrity; and, on
opening
the third roll, the unknown exclaimed,
I have found it at last! After examining
it carefully, he explained to Arthur and Mrs.
Campbell that it was the grant of a large tract
of land in Missouri, to James Mac Ferguson,
for services rendered the United States
during
the revolutionary war; that a lead-mine
of immense value had been discovered in this
tract; and that he had come to New-York
with forty thousand dollars, prepared for the
purchase, provided any heirs could be found.
And I am delighted, continued he, to
find those heirs are George and Mary
Campbell
.
I am glad, too, for their sakes, rejoined
the Recluse. I am not the rich man now
that I was when I first became their friend;
and I shall not allow any trifling services I
have rendered to interfere with their
choosing
a wealthier one. Oh, shame fall on
her, if she should forsake you, after all your
goodness, cried the old woman. Arthur
Vanderlyn, thou art a noble creature! said
the stranger, warmly pressing his hand, and
fixing his admiring eye upon him. But,
added he, with an arch smile, you are not
fit for the world you live in. Suppose,
instead
of taking it for granted that Mary
Campbell is going to cast off a disinterested
5B
lover, merely because she is mistress of
twenty thousand dollars, you should make a
little more inquiry into the value of this
property? You told me it was worth
forty thousand, replied the Recluse. If
I did, I told you truly, said the stranger,
smiling; for I came both ready and willing
to give eighty thousand for this valuable
tract.
The young man looked upon him with
unrestrained surprise. Who could it be, that
thus lavished gold around him like a
successful
alchymist! Whoever he was, he
continued
to speak to the Recluse with more
freedom than any other man would have
dared; and he was listened to with increasing
and even affectionate respect. After a long
conversation, the important paper was placed
in Arthur's hands, at Mrs. Campbell's
request
.
A letter was immediately written to
apprise Mary of her good fortune, and the
stranger offered to take it to Miss Campbell
in person. Vanderlyn's reserve had been
entirely conquered by the gracious nobility
of his character and manners; and, when he
bade him farewell, the ensuing morning, he
expressed an earnest wish that their
acquaintance
might be renewed. Perhaps it may,
at some future time, replied the unknown;
and he spoke it so emphatically, that his
friend could not drive it from his mind, until
a letter from Mary, a few hours after,
changed
the current of his thoughts. She wrote
to tell him she had heard of his late
misfortunes
,
and to reproach him for his kindness
in concealing them from her. She said she
did not ask permission for George and
herself
to work for him, until his debts were
paid; that she had resolved upon it, and
would not change her purpose. Arthur
almost rejoiced at the distress which had
procured
him such a proof of her attachment
and energy; and his curiosity was doubly
excited to know how far unexpected wealth
would have power to dazzle her
unsophisticated
nature.
Two days elapsed before he received
a reply to the letter he had sent by the
stranger
.
Its contents convinced him that Mary
rejoiced at her change of fortune, only
because
it gave her the power of evincing
gratitude
to him. Her first request was, that
a comfortable house and good nurse should
be immediately provided for her
grandmother
.
She then proceeded to tell him, that
the dark-eyed man, who offered to purchase
the lead-mine, visited her continually, and
urged her to marry his eldest son; who, he
said, was handsome, twenty times as rich as
Arthur Vanderlyn, even when she first knew
him, and besides all that he had seen her,
and was desperately in love with her. Mary
added, she knew not what to make of all
this; but her instructress thought him a
needy adventurer, who wished to secure her
money; and she really wished Mr. Vanderlyn
would come and transact her business with
him, without delay.
This summons was of course readily
obeyed
.
On his arrival, he was astonished to
find how much art had been used to dazzle
Mary's ambition, and win her affections from
him; and many a time he sighed that
hypocrisy
should have the power to move so
majestically in the disguise of high-minded
virtue.
For various reasons, it seemed desirable
than Vanderlyn should possess a legal right
to protect the orphan and her property; and
an immediate marriage was decided upon.
The unknown could not be found; but eighty
thousand dollars were remitted, with a
promise
to see Miss Campbell in a few days.
A new mansion was purchased in the
immediate
vicinity of New-York; and the
morning
after a very private wedding, little George
accompanied the bride and bridegroom there.
Mary was delighted with the tasteful
arrangement
of every thing around her; but what
was Vanderlyn's surprise when he found all
his beloved pictures and statues, with many
a valuable addition! Even his birds and
flowers were there; and the servant joyfully
announced that the horses and greyhounds
had arrived! Before he had time to allude
to the mysterious benefactor, whose conduct
had been so strangely contradictory, the door
opened, and he appeared. Forgetful of his
suspicions, Vanderlyn eagerly stepped
forward
to meet him. The stranger seized his
hand, and looked upon him with unutterable
affection, as he said, God bless you,
Arthur
:
may your romantic loves be happy.
Then sinking his head upon the young man's
shoulder, he added, in a troubled voice,
My son, my son!
* * * * * *
When the first agitating moments of
surprise
and happiness were over, Arthur
inquired
why he had been led to suppose he
had no father. I was obliged to take a
long and perilous voyage, replied the elder
Vanderlyn. I thought it very probable I
might never return. I wished you to inherit
my fortune; yet I feared to trust you with
so large a sum in the heyday of youth and
passion. If I died, I believed you would,
sooner or later, thank me for the precautions
I took; and if I lived, I should have the
satisfaction of seeing how my son would bear
wealth and freedom. I have seen it, Arthur;
and it has been balm to my heart that your
life, though a visionary one, has been
unstained
by anything of sin or shame. But
society has its duties, and its pleasures too;
and my dear son must no longer live out of
a world which needs all the assistance of the
good and the gifted. When the long winter
evenings come, I will tell you, George, how
I landed in Mexico, went to view the
lead-mines
in Missouri, and finally hastened to
New-York, on account of letters I received
from my son's trustees; but I shall not tell
you how much I have learned to love your
sweet sister Mary; nor shall I ask Mrs.
Vanderlyn's pardon for urging her to marry
my son.
Never was there a happier family than the
one now assembled around him who was once
called the Recluse of the Lake. Mary's
mind gradually expanded under the influence
of her husband and father, until she
sympathized
with the artist and the poet in his
most refined and intellectual pleasures. The
grandmother was amply provided for, and
many a kind indication of remembrance sent
her. As for little George, he was in a
perfect
ecstasy with every thing he saw and
heard. His bird-cage was suspended in the
breakfast room; but, when he began to sound
the praises of its beautiful inmate, Arthur
Vanderlyn would affectionately part the hair
on the boy's forehead, and answer playfully,
Nay, brother George; now
I
have the
handsomest bird-cage; and the handsomest
bird in the whole world in it.
SPRING.
I have learn'd
To look on Nature, not as in the hour
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
The still sad music of humanity,
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power
To chasten and subdue.
Wordsworth
.
Spring
bursts upon us in sudden maturity,
as if the very seasons had caught the spirit
of the age, and childhood had, in everything,
become unfashionable. There is a
joyousness
in the light, and warmth, and warbling
of these sunny days; and unlike all other
joyousness, it increases with our years. The
young prefer autumn; for there is a love of
melancholy inherent in our nature; and in
youth the heart is so full of gladness, so
mantled in its own sunlight, that it looks to
the external world for the novelty of
sadness
.
But as we grow older, the piping
winds, leafless trees, and marble skies of
autumn, are too much in accordance with
our own wearied spirit: the old look to
Nature
for the novelty of gladness.
And yet it is painful to compare the
springtime
of the year with the spring-time of life.
The first bird-note that rings through the air,
sounds as plaintively as To return to
Lochaber
no more; for when will the
springtime
of the heart return? When again will
fancy pillow herself on the passing cloud,
and view heaven and earth mingled in one
glorious dream? Angels are around us in
the morning of life; and their blessed visions
become so distinctly our own, that
imagination
has the vividness of experience, and
earth receives its colouring from heaven.
But when the world's chilly touch has
wakened
us, we seldom dream again. At best,
short and fitful are the gleams of hope; and
if they dazzle, they do not warm the soul.
But it is the very spirit of egotism that
makes us sigh at the sight of infancy, and
weep at the return of spring. If the glory
has departed from us, if the shadows are still
lengthening as the sun of our life goes down,
blessed be God, the change is in ourselves.
Others can still dream as we have dreamed,
and perchance be blest enough to die while
their own visions are a heaven. Let the
seasons pass on in their beauty! We return
no more, but they will return. Spring
comes, with joy around her like an
atmosphere
,
folding all Nature in her sunny veil,
and gladdening the soul of man. Be our
autumnal croakings stilled: they ill accord
with the season; and we would not, like
winter, chill the lap of May.
BEAUTY.
On
evening sky, or tinted flower,
Or wild bird in his sportive hour,
Or the gay insect's tinsel'd wing,
Rich as poetic imaging,
Where'er thy radiant form may dwell,
Beauty, I love thee passing well!
In the blest infant's cherub eye,
Beaming with all its native sky,
In the folds of its weak embrace,
Or the smile on its lovely face;
Where'er thy radiant form may dwell,
Beauty, I love thee passing well!
In ample waves of glossy hair,
Floating about the young and fair,
As they rejoiced, in breezy play,
O'er beings bright as summer's day;
Where'er thy radiant form may dwell,
Beauty, I love thee passing well!
Where sculpture leaves its magic trace
Of woman, in her airy grace;
Or on the lofty brows of men,
Imprints their godlike origin;
Where'er thy radiant form may dwell,
Beauty, I love thee passing well!
And where the painter's power hath given
To earthly things the hues of heaven,
'Tis Nature's mirror, bright and fair,
And all we love is lovelier there!
Blest art! I find no words to tell
The power I love so passing well!
HARRIET BRUCE.
To be beloved is all I need,
And whom I love I love indeed.
Coleridge
.
My
friend Harriet Bruce was a healthy,
tall, English-looking girl; somewhat too large
and vigorous for genuine beauty, yet gifted
with a speaking expression, and a rich,
perpetual
colouring, that would have made any
other face stylish and attractive. She was
no favourite with the gentlemen; but there
was an indescribable something about her
appearance and manners, which always
compelled
them to inquire who she was. No
person ever talked with her without
remembering
what she said; and every one criticised
what they could not forget. Yet it was not
intellect that made her unpopularhad she
chosen to affect reckless misanthropy,
maudlin
sensibility, or any other wart or
stammer
,
whereby to distinguish herself, she
would have found plenty of admirers and
imitators; but in her mind genius was
checked
by manly philosophy; and she could ill
conceal her contempt of those who knew
talent
only by its most common diseases. The
consciousness of mental power, that lighted
up her eye with such a burning spark of
pride, and the expression of scorn for ever
dancing on her lip-corners, ready to embody
itself in sarcasm, was unquestionably the true
reason why this splendid creature became the
Paria of the ball-room. She was a strange
sort of Di'Vernonno, she was not a
Di'Vernon, eitherand as I now remember
her, I cannot think of a single character,
living
or imaginary, whom she did resemble.
She fascinated her enemies, but never
pleased
her friends. Power! power! and, above
all, intellectual power! was the constant
dream of her wild ambition. To have been
sure of Madame de Stael's reputation, she
would have renounced human sympathy, and
lived unloving and unbeloved in this wide
world of social happinessthere was such
8
magnificence in the idea of sending one's
genius abroad, like a spark of electricity, to
be active and eternal,defying education in
its form, duration, and power! Sometimes
I talked of love, and reminded her how
Madame
de Stael herself had become its
reluctant
victim. On this subject she often
philosophized
,
and always laughed. Who,
said she, scornfully, who that has felt the
gush and the thrill attendant upon fame,
would be foolish enough to exchange dominion
over many for the despotism of one? Thus
Harriet Bruce reasoned, and thus she
actually
thoughtbut I knew her better than she
knew herself. Her affections were as rich
and overflowing as her mental energies; and
her craving for human sympathy was in
direct
proportion to that intense love of beauty,
which, in her, amounted to an intellectual
passion. That she would love exclusively
and extravagantly, I had no doubt; and my
penetration soon singled out an object. At
a large party, I first saw her with George
Macdonoughthe son of a rich southerner,
first in his class, and in the full flush of manly
beauty. I knew by the carriage of his neck
that he was a Virginian,and the hauteur
with which he received adulation, attracted
my attention, as the pawing of a high-mettled
horse would have done. His conversation
with Harriet seemed at first to be of a sober
and learned cast; but on her part it soon
became petulant. Now and then I heard
some remark which seemed to relate to a
transmigration of souls, and a continual rise
in intellectual existence. Oh, exclaimed
Harriet, how that idea savours of
New-England
house-keeping!How can a
Virginian
patronize a theory so economical?
At that moment, a very lovely girl entered
the room; and the young man did not
answer
Miss Bruce's question. Ah, there is
the beautiful Baltimorean, said heshe
whom I told you reminded me of that fine
engraving of yours, `La belle Suisse.' She
is
beautiful, said Harriet, with unaffected
warmth. Her full dark eyes are
magnificent
what
a pity it is they are not lighted
from
within;
that expression alone is
wanting
to fill the measure of her glory! The
8A
remark was made to an inattentive listener;
for Macdonough's whole interest was
absorbed
by the new-comer. A slight shade passed
over Harriet's face,but it was too transient
to define the emotion in which it originated;
and she smiled, as she said, You had best
go and talk with you powerful beautythe
body should be where the spirit is. That
reproach is too severe, replied the Virginian.
I meant no reproach, she answered; I
have observed that beauty is your idol, and
I wish you to worship it. I did not think
Miss Bruce had observed my character
sufficiently
to form any conclusion with regard to
my taste. The pride of the proudest girl
in christendom was rousedand there was
something indescribably provoking in her
manner, as she answered, I assure you, I
think you quite a specimen, in your way.
`Society is such a bag of polished marbles,'
that any thing odd is as valuable a study as
the specimens of quartz Mr. Symmes may
bring us. Your modesty has led you into a
mistake; I have really taken the trouble to
observe you. Truly, Miss Bruce, you
are the most singular girl I ever met, said
the offended southerner; you never did,
said, or thought any thing like another
person
.
When a compliment is doubtful,
Chesterfield
says one should always take it;
therefore I am obliged to you, Mr.
Macdonough
,
replied Harriet. And so saying,
she turned abruptly from him, and directed
her attention to me.
During the remainder of the evening, I
saw no indications of a reconciliation.
Harriet
danced but onceMacdonough and La
belle Suisse were near her in the set; and
they met frequently. The
extreme
nonchalance
with which she now and then exchanged
some casual remark, led me to suspect that
he had obtained more power over her
extraordinary
mind than any other individual had
ever possessed; but Harriet was no trifler,
and I did not venture to prophesy.
Time passed on, and with it nearly passed
the remembrance of this skirmish of words,
and the thoughts thereby suggested. My
unmanageable friend seldom alluded to the
8B
fascinating acquaintance she had formed;
and when she did, it was done naturally and
briefly. Soon after this, I was obliged to be
absent for several months. I did not return
until two days before commencement at
college; and Harriet's first
exclamation
was, You
must
go to Mr. Macdonough's
roomhe is to have the first part; and his
friends expect every thing from him! But
I thought you considered commencement
days very stupid things, said I; So I do;
you know I always said life itself was a very
stupid thing. There is no originality above
ground: every thing that is true is dull, and
every thing new is false and superficial. But
there is no use in quarrelling with the world
it is a pretty good world, after all. You
must go to hear Mr. Macdonough's opinion
of it: I am sure he will express it eloquently.
Then you are on good terms,
now?
said I.
She blushed painfullyexcessively,but
soon recovered self-command enough to
reply
,
I always thought highly of him. I
do not know whether my looks expressed
the warning voice my heart was yearning to
utter; but I am sure the tone of my assent
was reluctant and melancholy.
George Macdonough appeared most
brilliantly
on that memorable day! Graceful
and dignified, handsome and talented, he sent
a thrill to all hearts, alive to the grandeur of
thought, or the beauty of language. During
this scene of triumph, I watched the
countenance
of Harriet Bruce with the keenest
interest
;
and never before did I see a human
face through which the soul beamed with
such intensity. Genius, and pride, and joy,
and love were there! I then thought she
was intellectually beautiful, beyond anything
I had ever seen. Poor Harriet! It was the
brightest spot in her life, and I love to
remember
it.
Macdonough's room was crowded; and
the compliments he received were
intoxicating
;
but in the midst of it all, I imagined I
could see the sparkle of his eyes melt into
softness, when he met a glance from Harriet.
Her looks betrayed nothing to my anxious
observation; but once I took notice she
called
him
George,
and suddenly corrected
herself with an air of extraordinary
confusion
.
Had my friend indulged in habits of
girlish trifling, I should no doubt have
playfully
alluded to this circumstance; but there
was something in her character and manners
which forbade such officiousness. I watched
her with the anxiety of sincere friendship.
I knew when she once selected an object of
pursuit, her whole soul was concentrated;
and I could not believe that the proud
Virginian
,
with all his high hopes, and his love
of dazzling beauty, would ever marry her.
I knew he was a very constant visiter, and I
frequently observed lights later than had
been usual in Mr. Bruce's quiet habitation;
and when he called to bid me farewell, a few
weeks after commencement, the deep gloom
on his countenance led me to think that the
pride and apparent indifference of my
intellectual
friend might have surprised him into
love.
Weeks and months passed on, and I seldom
heard an allusion to the absent Macdonough.
Harriet's character and manners seemed
changing for the better. The perpetual
effervescence of her spirit in some measure
subsided, and the vagaries of her fancy
became
less various and startling; yet there
was ever a chastened cheerfulness of manner,
and an unfailing flow of thought. By
degrees
her seriousness deepened; and, at
last, she could not conceal from me that she
was unhappy. I attributed it to the illness
of her aged father,for Harriet was
motherless
;
and she cherished her only parent with
a double share of love. But when the old
man was evidently recovering, and her
melancholy
still increased, I knew there must
be another, and a deeper cause. One day,
as I stood by her, watching her progress in a
crayon drawing,around which she had
thrown much of her early spirit and freedom,
I placed my hand affectionately on her
shoulder, and touching her forehead with my
lips, said, You have always told me your
thoughts, Harrietwhy not tell me what
troubles you
now?
She contined her task
with a quick and nervous movement, and I
saw that her eyes were filling with tears. I
gently whispered, is George Macdonough
the cause? She gave one shriek, which
sounded as if it made a rent in her very soul,
and then the torrent of her tears poured
forth.
It was long before I ventured to say to her,
Then it is as I feared? You do love
George Macdonough? She looked in my
face with a strange and fixed expression, as
she replied, I ought `to love, and honour,
and obey' him; for he is my husband! I
started! Your husband! howwhen
where were you married?
At Providence. Do you remember
when I asked you to go with me to Mr.
Macdonough's
room, and you said, `So, then,
you are on good terms
now?
'I had been
three weeks a wife! And your father
does he know of it? Certainly, she
said; you know I would not deceive
him
.
Then why was so much secresy
necessary
?
I now think it was not really
necessary
;
at all events, that which needs to
be concealed is wrong. But George's parents
wished him to marry wealth, and he feared
to displease them. He has a moderate
fortune
of his own, of which he will soon come
in possession; when he told my father this
circumstance, and added that he feared he
should be urged to marry against his
inclination
,
my father, in the blindness of his
dotage
,
consented to our immediate union.
Then why are you so unhappy? I
inquired
;
you have no doubt that your
husband
will come and claim you? Oh, no!
The certificate is in my father's hands; and
if it were not, a sense of honour would lead
him here. But, oh! to have him come
coldly and reluctantly! my heart will break!
my heart will break! said she, pressing her
hand hard against her forehead, and weeping
bitterly. How
could
I forget, that they
who listen to passion, rather than to reason,
must always have a precarious influence on
each other? I tried to console hershe
said nothing; but took a package of letters
from her desk, and handed them to me.
Their contents proved the mournful
prediction
of her fears too true. At first, George
Macdonough wrote with impatient ardour;
then his letters were filled with amusing
accounts
of the parties given to La belle Suisse,
whose father had come to reside in their
neighbourhood; then he filled his pages with
excellent reasons for not visiting her as soon
as he intended; and finally, when Harriet
bowed down her pride, and entreated him,
if he valued her reputation, to come soon
he sent a cold laconic answer, merely stating
the time at which he might be expected.
Poor Harriet! It was too evident she had
thrown away all that made existence joyful.
However, I tried to soothe her by the idea
that gentleness, patience, and untiring love,
might regain the affection on which her
happiness
must
now depend. She loved to
listen
to such wordsthey were a balm to her
heart.
Mr. Macdonough came at the time he had
appointed, and publicly announced his
marriage
.
I did not see their meeting; but
during the few months he remained at her
father's, I observed his manner was uniformly
kind, though frequently absent and
constrained
.
An infant daughter formed a new bond
of union, and seemed to be the herald of
happier
days. The young man watched over the
little object with the most intense delight;
and Harriet's half-subdued character seemed
entirely softened, in the doating fondness of a
mother, and the meek resignation of a wife,
loved, but not enough beloved; none
would have recognized the proud, ambitious,
and sarcastic Harriet Bruce.
I must not dwell minutely on particulars,
which I observed closely at the time, and
which afterward sunk deeply into memory.
Young Macdonough departed once more to
take possession of his estate, and prepare it
for the reception of his wife and child.
His farewell was affectionate; and his
frequent
letters seemed to restore my
imprudent
friend to something of her former
buoyancy
of soul. The idea of separation from
her father was now her principal source of
unhappiness; but that trial was spared her
the imbecility of the affectionate old man
daily increased, and, a few days before his
son's arrival, death relieved him from
loneliness
.
The young husband came, as he had
promised
;
but his manner was colder, and his
looks more stern than formerly, though none
could say he failed in the fulfilment of his
duty. Harriet never spoke of any change;
her manner toward him was obedient, and
affectionate; but never fond. Her romantic
visions of human perfection, her proud
confidence
in her own strength, were gone; and,
no doubt, she wept bitterly over their mutual
rashness. Knowing, as she did, that she
was a burthen, taken up merely from a sense
of honour, it is not wonderful her very smile
had a look of humility and resignation.
Their regrets were however kept carefully
concealed; whatever might have been their
feelings, both seemed resolved on a system
of silent endurance. There was something
in this course a thousand times more
affecting
than the most pathetic complaints. I
shall never forget the anguish I felt, when
I saw Harriet bid farewell to the home of
her childhood,that home where she had
ever been an idol and an oracle. The
lingering
preparation of departure,the
heart-broken
expression,the reluctant step,the
drooping head,and the desperate
resolution
with which she at last seized the arm
of a husband who loved her not, and who
was about to convey her among strangers,
they are all present to me now!
Harriet's letter soon spoke of declining
health; and before three years had elapsed,
she implored me to come to her, if I ever
wished to look upon her again in this world
of shadows.
I immediately obeyed the summons.
Things were worse than I had expected.
She was evidently very weak; and though
she had every thing which wealth could
supply, or politeness dictate, the balm of
kindness never refreshed her weary and
sinking
spirit. Mr. Macdonough never spoke
harshlyindeed he seldom spoke at all; but
the attentions he paid were so obviously from
a sense of duty, that they fell like ice-drops
on the heart of his suffering wife. I heard
no reproaches on either side; but a day
seldom
passed without some occurrence more
or less painful to my friend. Once, when
little Louisa jumped into her father's arms,
as he entered, and eagerly exclaimed, Do
you love me, papa? he kissed her with much
fondness, and replied, Yes I do, my child.
And mamma, too? inquired the little
creature, with a sort of half entreating tone,
so graceful in childhood,he put her away
from him, and answered coldly, Certainly,
my daughter. I saw a slight convulsion in
Harriet's face, and in the motion of her
hands; but it soon passed. At another
time, when we were searching in his private
library for the latest number of the
Edinburgh
,
we discovered on a small open desk
the engraving of La belle Suisse, and near it
a newspaper giving an account of the marriage
of that young Baltimorean, whom George
had thought so strongly resembled the
picture
.
The surprise was so sudden, that
Harriet
lost the balance of feelings she had
hitherto
so well preserved. She rushed out of
the room,and it was several hours before
I was admitted to her bedside.
Fortunately for my sensitive friend, this
mental struggle was too fierce to be of long
continuance. The closing scene of her life
drew near; and to her it seemed welcome
as sleep to the weary. Sometimes the
movements
of reluctant nature were visible in the
intense look of love she cast upon her child,
and the convulsive energy with which she
would clasp the little one to her bosom; but
otherwise all was stillness and hope.
One day, when she had been unusually
ill, and we all supposed she was about to die,
she pressed my hand feebly, and whispered,
Will you ask George to see me once
more? I immediately repaired to the
library
,
and told Mr. Macdonough the dying
request of his wife. At first, he made a
motion
toward the door,then, suddenly
checking
himself, he said, in a determined tone,
I had better not. It will be painful to both.
I will wait the event here. I returned to
Harriet; but I had not courage to say her
request was refused. She listened eagerly
to every sound for awhile; then looking in
my face mournfully, she said, He will not
come! My tears answered her. She
looked
upward for a moment, with an expression
of extreme agony; but she never spoke
again.

TO THE FRINGED GENTIAN.
Purple
flower, pale autumn's child,
Blooming in beauty lone and wild
Slowly matured by sun and shower,
To reign awhile in fleeting power;
Yet bashfully in that brief space
Hiding from view thy lovely face,
Veiling thy imperial tinge
Beneath a modest robe of fringe.
When summer-days are long and bright,
Thy lovely form ne'er meets the sight;
But when October guides the year,
And points to seasons cold and drear,
It gracefully his path-way strews,
And smiles beneath his shiv'ring dews.
Thus buds of virtue often bloom
The fairest, mid the deepest gloom.
Their latent loveliness conceal'd,
And not one embryo tint reveal'd;
Till left by fortune's sunny beam,
To ripen in affliction's gleam.
THE
BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL CONVICT.
[It may be thought that the following story conveys a
bad moral: but it is actually true; and since vice and
folly are sometimes triumphant in this world, and
goodness
is sometimes depressed, we should learn to look for
reward where alone it is always certain to be found;
i. e.
within our own hearts.]
Rose Mac Orne
was a rare sample of
Scottish beauty. Her eyes deeply blue, as
Loch Lomond; glowing cheeks; hair light
and glossy, parted over her broad forehead,
like folds of flax-coloured satin; features,
which a shrewd and active mind had strongly
developed; a tall, muscular frame, of stately
proportions; and a firm, elastic, rapid tread,
which she had acquired in early days, when
Down the rocks she leaped along,
Like rivulets in May.
Her youth was unfortunate; for her
mother
had died during her infancy, and her
9B
profligate and selfish father had abandoned
her before she reached the dangerous age of
fifteen.
Many were anxious to take Rose into their
service; for she was neat and thrifty as a
brownie, and had the obsequious manner of
her countrymen, united with their proverbial
knowledge of the most direct road to favour
and to fortune. Her greatest misfortune was
her beauty. Often, after the most
unremitting
efforts to please, poor Rose was accused
of a thousand faults, and dismissed by
prudent
wives and mothers, lest she should
become
too dear a servant. Scotch
discrimination
soon discovered the source of the
difficulty, and Scotch ambition resolved to
make the most of it. To lovers of her own
rank, she was alternately winning and
disdainful
determined
that none should break her
chains, yet dealing out her scorn to each, as
their characters would bear. With her
superiors
,
she played a deep and insidious game.
Trusting to her own strength of pride, she
resisted their arts, while she almost invariably
made them the victims of her own. In all
this, Rose was actuated by something more
than a mere girlish love of flirtation and
triumph
:
she was ambitious, and had formed
high hopes of an opulent marriage. Many a
Cantab and Oxonian, many a testy bachelor
and gouty widower, had got entangled in her
toils, and been extricated only by the early
interference of proud or prudent relations.
At length, notwithstanding her modest
manners
and apparent artlessness, the intrigues
of Rose Mac Orne became as proverbial as
her beauty; and she could obtain no service
in any family where there was youth to be
fascinated, or wealthy old age to be cajoled.
Hearing an East-Indiaman was about to
sail, with many ladies on board, Rose
resolved
to seek employment among them; and
succeeded in being appointed dressing-maid
to an elderly lady, who was going out to
Calcutta
to reside with an invalid son. India!
match-making India! opened glorious
prospects
to Scotch ambition. Rose took
unexampled
pains to please her new mistress;
and in two days she was a decided favourite.
No wonder the gipsey began to be proud of
her power; for she never attempted to please
without decidedly effecting her purpose. But
when was inordinate ambition known to be a
safeguard either to talent or to beauty? In
two days Rose was to leave England, and
her mistress having granted her permission
to attend the races, she, as a last act of
kindness
to one of her earliest and most favoured
lovers, consented to accompany him. Rose
was very fond of ornaments; and it chanced
that her heart was particularly set on a large
pearl pin, which her mistress had said she
seldom wore, on account of its antique fashion.
Rose had more than once signified how very
pretty she thought it; and wondered, if she
were rich enough to buy pearls, whether they
would become her full and snowy neck.
She dared not ask for it outright; and she
never in her lifetime had thought of taking
any thing dishonestly. But vanity, vanity,
that foolish and contemptible passion which
has slain its tens of thousands, and that,
too, among the fairest and the brightest of
God's works, prevailed over the better
feelings
of Rose Mac Orne. She took the envied
pin,wore it to the races,heard James
Mac Lotyre praise it,told him her new
mistress had given it to her,and then,
dreading the discovery of the fact, began to
devise schemes for exchanging the bauble.
The path of sin is steep, and every step
presses us forward with accumulated power.
Rose had already committed a second crime
to conceal the first; and now the hope of
secresy urged her to commit others. She
sold the breast-pin, and bought a ring with
the money, in hopes the pearl would never
be inquired for this side of India. But in
this she was mistaken; that very day her
lady missed the jewel; and Rose went even
deeper in falsehood than was necessary to
keep up appearances.
I will not follow her through every step of
this shameful struggle. It is sufficient to say
the theft was discovered; and Rose, instead
of sailing for glorious match-making India,
was in a few weeks hurried on board a
vessel
,
in which sixty-two other convicts were
destined for Botany Bay. This was a
painful
reverse for one so young, so beautiful, so
inordinately ambitious. She looked back
upon England with mingled feelings of grief
and burning indignationcontempt of herself,
and hatred of the laws by which she suffered.
And for what had she endured this terrible
conflict, which, first and last, had given her
more unhappiness than had been crowded
into the whole of her previous existence!
Why nothing but the foolish vanity of
wearing
a cast-off pearl!
But Rose Mac Orne had a mind elastic
and vigorous: it soon rebounded from
depression
,
and began to think of new schemes
of conquest. She looked around among her
companionsmost of them were tall and
robust
some
of them very handsome women.
She counted them, and counted the crew.
There were sixty-two convicts, and fifteen
men. Before they were half across the
Atlantic
,
Rose Mac Orne had laid a plan, daring
enough for the helmeted Joan of Arc in the
full tide of her inspiration. She
communicated
the plan to the women, which they
entered into heartily and warmly. Rose
might have found lovers enough on board,
notwithstanding the strict orders of the
officers; but she chose to inveigle but one
and that was to be the Pilot! Glances and
tender notes soon passed between them,
unperceived
by others; for the artful Rose was
like a glacier, when the eye of the officers
was upon her; and her lover was capable of
playing as deep game as she.
At length the important hour arrived
every precaution had been takenall things
were in readiness. The vessel stood for the
La Plata, to exchange cargoes and take in
refreshments. They entered the huge arms
of that silvery river, and cut its waters with
the arrowy flight of a bird. At length
Buenos Ayres lay before them in the
distance
,
with the broad clear moonlight, spread
over it like a heavenly robe. The wind died
awayand the vessel lay gently moving on
the bosom of that majestic river, like a child
playing itself into slumber. Midnight came
Rose had an eye like a burning glassthe
crisis was at handand all looked to her for
direction. Her lover, according to promise,
had taken his turn to be pilot; and all slept,
save him and the convicts. He sat at the
helm looking out upon the waters, and
listening
to the silent audible. There was a
slight motion of the sails, announced by a
low whistle from the pilot. In twenty
minutes
every man was bound fast and gagged,
the convicts were armed,and the vessel
was in full sweep for the port of Buenos
Ayres! There it arriveda prize to the
prisoners! Great noise was made about the
vessel seized by women, and brought
triumphantly
into port. The Lady Shore
(for that was the vessel's name) was crowded
with South Americans. The bravery of the
women was loudly applauded; and in three
days the richest young Spaniard in the city
offered himself to the bold and beautiful
Rose Mac Orne. Her promise to the pilot
was forgotten. The ambitious Scotchwoman
now wears pearls and diamonds in plenty.
Of her sister convicts, some retained their
early vices, and died miserable vagabonds;
others repented and reformed, and became
respectable women.
ROMANCE.
Unearthly minstrelsy! then only heard
When the soul seeks to hear; when all is hushed,
And the heart listens!
Coleridge
.
It
is the fashion in this philosophic day
to laugh at Romance, and cut all
acquaintance
with sentiment; but I doubt whether
these same philosophers are not making
themselves `too
wise
to be happy.'
Wordsworth
has called `fancy the mother of deep
truth,' and perhaps the time will come when
the learned will acknowledge that there is
more philosophy in Romance, than their
sagacity
has dreamed of. Mysterious
aspirations
after something higher and holier,
the gladness of fancy that comes upon the
heart in the stillness of nature,impatience
under the tyranny of earth-born passions,
and the pure and joyous light of truth,
reflecting
its own innocent brightness on a
corrupted
and selfish world,all these belong
to the young and the romantic. What does
increase of years and knowledge teach us?
It teaches us to seem what we are not,to
act as if the world were what we know it is
not,and to be cautious not to alarm the
self-love of others, lest our own should be
wounded in return. And is this wisdom?
No. I do believe the young mind, that has
not reasoned itself into scepticism and
coldness
,
stands nearer heaven's own light, and
reflects it more perfectly, than the proud
ones who laugh at its intuitive perceptions.
Do not all the boasted results of human
research
and human philosophy vary in
different
ages, climates, situations, and
circumstances
?
Are not all the deep, immutable, and
sacred sympathies, that bind mankind in the
golden chain of brotherhood, instinctive?
Yes, I do believe the influences of a better
world are around youthful purity, teaching
it a higher and more infallible morality than
has ever been taught by worldly experience.
Man must wander from the school of Nature
before he can need to look for his duties in
a code of ethics.
The Egyptians had a pleasant fancy with
regard to the soul. They thought that the
minds of men were once angelic spirits, who,
discontented with their heavenly home, had
passed its boundary, drank the cup of
oblivion
suspended half way between heaven
and earth, and descended to try their destiny
among mortals. Here, reminiscences of what
they had left would come before them in
glances and visions, startling memory into
hope, and waking experience into prophecy.
Various philosophers have supposed that our
souls have passed, and will yet pass, through
infinite modes of existence. It is a theory I
love to think upon. There is something
beautiful in the idea that we have thus
obtained
the sudden thoughts, which sometimes
flash into life at the touch of association,
fresh as if newly created, yet familiar as if
they had always slumbered in the soul.
How the beautiful things of creation arouse
a crowd of fitful fancies in the mind. Is not
the restlessness produced by their indistinct
loveliness strangely like a child's puzzled
remembrance of its early abandoned home?
But all this is not to the point. My
question
is, not how romantic ideas came into the
soul,but whether it be true wisdom to drive
them thence?
Observation of the world will convince us
that it is not wise to expel romantic ideas,
but simply to regulate them. All our nicest
sympathies, and most delicate perceptions,
have a tinge of what the world calls romance.
Let earthly passions breathe upon them, or
experience touch them with her icy finger,
and they flit away like fairies when they
hear the tread of a human foot. There are
those who laugh at love, imagination, and
religion, and sneeringly call them `dreams
all dreams;' but the proudest of them cannot
laugh at the lover, the poet, and the
devotee
,
without a smothered sigh that their
rial visitants have gone from him for ever,
and the dark mantle of worldly experience
fallen so heavily over their remembered
glories.
It is wise to keep something of romance,
though not too much. Our nature is an
union of extremes; and it is true
philosophy
to keep them balanced.
To let the imagination sicken with love of
ideal beauty, till it pines away into echo, is
worse than folly; but to check our affections,
and school our ideas, till thought and feeling
reject every thing they cannot see, touch,
and handle, certainly is not wisdom.
Do not send reason to the school of
theory
,
and then bid her give a distinct outline
of shadowy fancies,she will but distort
what she cannot comprehend. Do not, by
petulance and sensuality, frighten away the
tenderness and holy reverence of youthful
lovephilosophy may teach you a lesson of
resignation, or scorn, but your heart is
human
,
and it cannot learn it. Do not reason
upon religion till it becomes lifeless; would
you murder and dissect the oracle to find
whence the voice of God proceeds?
Be, then, rational enough for earth; but
keep enough of romance to remind us of
heaven. We will not live on unsubstantial
fairy-ground,but we will let the beautiful
troop visit us without being scared from the
scene of their graceful and happy gambols.
TO A WEALTHY LADY,
WHOSE HUSBAND SOON BECAME INDIFFERENT TO HER.
Lady,
thou art passing fair!
And flowers are wreathed around thee
With marble brow, and shining hair,
Hath the spirit of beauty crowned thee.
Embedded in a radiant curl,
The diamond mocks thine eye;
And snowy bands of orient pearl
Around thy bosom lie.
And yet thy smile, I know not why,
Hath lost its joyful meaning;
And the low music of thy sigh
Is sorrow's fitful dreaming.
Thou canst not hide it, lovely one,
By any splendid token;
Thy transient dream of bliss is done
Thy widow'd heart is broken.
I envy not the gold and pearl
That shine on thy aching breast;
I could not seek life's giddy whirl,
To stun my spirit into rest.
Ah no! when those I love are cold,
And look on me with careless eye,
Not all thy dazzling heaps of gold
Could tempt me not to die.
THE INDIAN WIFE.
May slighted woman turn,
And as a vine the oak has shaken off,
Bend lightly to her tendencies again?
Oh, no! by all her loveliness, by all
That makes life poetry and beauty, no!
Make her a slave; steal from her rosy cheek
By needless jealousies; let the last star
Leave her a watcher by your couch of pain;
Wrong her by petulance, suspicion, all
That makes her cup a bitternessyet give
One evidence of love, and earth has not
An emblem of devotedness like her's.
But, oh! estrange her once, it boots not how
By wrong or silence, anything that tells
A change has come upon your tenderness
And there is not a high thing out of heaven.
Her pride o'ermastereth not.
Willis
.
Tahmiroo
was the daughter of a powerful
Sioux chieftain; and she was the only being
ever known to turn the relentless old man
from a savage purpose. Something of this
influence was owing to her infantile beauty;
but more to the gentleness of which that
beauty was the emblem. Her's was a species
10
of loveliness rare among Indian girls. Her
figure had the flexile grace so appropriate to
protected and dependant women in refined
countries; her ripe pouting lip, and dimpled
cheek, wore the pleading air of aggrieved
childhood; and her dark eye had such an
habitual expression of timidity and fear, that
the Young Sioux called her the Startled
Fawn. I know not whether her father's
broad lands, or her own appealing beauty,
was the most powerful cause of admiration;
but certain it is, Tahmiroo was the unrivalled
belle of the Sioux. She was a creature all
formed for love. Her down-cast eye, her
trembling lip, and her quiet, submissive
motion
,
all spoke its language; yet various
young chieftains had in vain sought her
affections
,
and when her father urged her to
strengthen his power by an alliance, she
answered him only by her tears.
This state of things continued until 1765,
when a company of French traders came to
reside there, for the sake of deriving profit
from the fur trade. Among them was
Florimond
de Rance, a young, indolent Adonis,
whom pure ennui had led from Quebec to the
Falls of St. Anthony. His fair, round face,
and studied foppery of dress, might have done
little towards gaining the heart of the gentle
Sioux; but there was a deference and
courtesy
in his manner, which the Indians never
pay degraded woman; and Tahmiroo's deep
sensibilities were touched by it. A more
careful arrangement of her rude dress, and
anxiety to speak his language fluently, and a
close observance of his European customs,
soon betrayed the subtle power which was
fast making her its slave. The ready vanity
of the Frenchman quickly perceived it. At
first he encouraged it with that sort of
undefined
pleasure which man always feels in
awakening strong affection in the hearts of
even the most insignificant. Then the idea
that, though an Indian, she was a princess,
and that her father's extensive lands on the
Missouri were daily becoming of more
consequence
to his ambitious nation, led him to
think of marriage with her as a desirable
object
.
His eyes and his manner had said this,
long before the old chief began to suspect it;
10A
and he allowed the wily Frenchman to twine
himself almost as closely around his heart, as
he had around the more yielding soul of his
darling child. Though exceedingly indolent
by nature, Florimond de Rance had acquired
skill in many graceful acts, which excited the
wonder of the savages.
He fenced well enough to foil the most
expert
antagonist; and in hunting, his rifle was
sure to carry death to the game. These
accomplishments
,
and the facility with which
his pliant nation conform to the usages of
savage life, made him a universal favourite;
and, at his request, he was formally adopted
as one of the tribe. But conscious as he was
of his power, it was long before he dared to
ask for the daughter of the haughty chief.
When he did make the daring proposition, it
was received with a still and terrible wrath,
that might well fright him from his purpose.
Rage showed itself only in the swelling veins
and clenched hand of the old chief.
With the boasted coldness and
self-possession
of an Indian, he answered, There are
Sioux girls enough for the poor pale-faces
that come among us. A King's daughter
weds the son of a King. Eagles must sleep
in an eagle's nest.
In vain Tahmiroo knelt and supplicated.
In vain she promised Florimond de Rance
would adopt all his enmities and all his
friendships
;
that in hunting, and in war, he would
be an invaluable treasure. The chief
remained
inexorable. Then Tahmiroo no
longer joined in the dance, and the old man
noticed that her rich voice was silent, when
they passed her wigwam. The light of her
beauty began to fade, and the bright
vermillion
current, which mantled under her brown
cheek, became sluggish and pale. The
languid glance she cast on the morning sun
and the bright earth, entered into her father's
soul. He could not see his beautiful child
thus gradually wasting away. He had long
averted his eyes whenever he saw
Florimond
de Rance; but one day, when he
crossed his hunting path, he laid his hand on
his shoulder, and pointed to Tahmiroo's
dwelling. Not a word was spoken. The
proud old man and the blooming lover
entered
10B
it together. Tahmiroo was seated in
the darkest corner of the wigwam, her head
leaning on her hand, her basket-work tangled
beside her, and a bunch of flowers, the
village
maidens had brought her, scattered and
withering at her feet.
The Chief looked upon her with a
vehement
expression of love, which none but
stern countenances can wear. Tahmiroo,
he said, in a subdued tone, go to the
wigwam
of the stranger, that your father may
again see you love to look on the rising sun,
and the opening flowers. There was
mingled
joy and modesty in the upward glance
of the Startled Fawn of the Sioux; and
when Florimond de Rance saw the light of
her mild eye, suddenly and timidly veiled by
its deeply-fringed lid, he knew that he had
lost none of his power.
The marriage song was soon heard in the
royal wigwam, and the young adventurer
became
the son of a King.
Months and years past on, and found
Tahmiroo
the same devoted, submissive being.
Her husband no longer treated her with the
uniform gallantry of a lover. He was not
often harsh: but he adopted something of
the coldness and indifference of the nation
he had joined. Tahmiroo sometimes wept
in secret; but so much of fear had lately
mingled with her love, that she carefully
concealed her grief from him who had
occasioned
it. When she watched his
countenance
,
with that pleading, innocent look,
which had always characterized her beauty,
she sometimes would obtain a glance such as
he had given her in her former days; and
then her heart would leap like a frolicsome
lamb, and she would live cheerfully on the
remembrance of that smile, through many
wearisome days of silence and neglect.
Never was woman, in her heart-breaking
devotedness
,
satisfied with such slight
testimonials
of love, as was this gentle Sioux girl.
If Florimond chose to fish, she would herself
ply the oar, rather than he should suffer
fatigue; and the gaudy canoe her father had
given her, might often be seen gliding down
the stream, while Tahmiroo dipped her oar
in unison with her soft rich voice, and the
indolent Frenchman lay sunk in luxurious
repose. She had learned his religion; but
for herself she never prayed. The cross he
had given her was always raised in
supplication
for him; and if he but looked unkindly
on her, she kissed it, and invoked its aid, in
agony of soul. She fancied the sound of his
native land might be dear to him; and she
studied his language with a patience and
perseverance
to which the savage has seldom
been known to submit. She tried to imitate
the dresses she had heard him describe; and
if he looked with a pleased eye on any
ornament
she wore, it was always reserved to
welcome his return. Yet, for all this
lavishness
of love, she asked but kind, approving
looks, which cost the giver nothing. Alas,
for the perverseness of man, in scorning the
affection he ceases to doubt! The little
pittance
of love for which poor Tahmiroo's heart
yearned so much, was seldom given. Her
soul was a perpetual prey to anxiety and
excitement
;
and the quiet certainty of
domestic
bliss was never her allotted portion.
There were, however, two beings, on whom
she could pour forth her whole flood of
tenderness
,
without reproof or disappointment.
She had given birth to a son and daughter of
uncommon promise. Victoire, the eldest,
had her father's beauty, save in the melting
dark eye, with its plaintive expression, and
the modest drooping of its silken lash. Her
cheeks had just enough of the Indian hue to
give them a warm, rich colouring; and such
was her early maturity, that at thirteen years
of age, her tall figure combined the graceful
elasticity of youth, with the staid majesty of
womanhood. She had sprung up at her
father's
feet, with the sudden luxuriance of a
tropical flower; and her matured loveliness
aroused all the dormant tenderness and
energy
within him. It was with mournful interest
he saw her leaping along the chase, with her
mother's bounding, sylphlike joy; and he
would sigh deeply when he observed her oar
rapidly cutting the waters of the Missouri,
while her boat flew over the surface of the
river like a wild bird in sportand the gay
young creature would wind among the
eddies
,
or dart forward with her hair streaming
on the wind, and her lips parted with
eagerness
.
Tahmiroo did not understand the
nature of his emotions. She thought, in the
simplicity of her heart, that silence and
sadness
were the natural expressions of a white
man's love; but when he turned his restless
gaze from his daughter to her, she met an
expression which troubled her. Indifference
had changed into contempt; and woman's
soul, whether in the drawing-room, or in the
wilderness, is painfully alive to the sting of
scorn. Sometimes her placid nature was
disturbed by a strange jealousy of her own
child. I love Victoire only because she is
the daughter of Florimond, thought she;
and why, oh! why, does he not love me
for being the mother of Victoire?
It was too evident that de Rance wished
his daughter to be estranged from her mother,
and her mother's people. With all members
of the tribe, out of his own family, he sternly
forbade her having any intercourse; and even
there he kept her constantly employed in
taking dancing lessons from himself, and
obtaining
various branches of learning from an
old Catholic priest, whom he had solicited
to reside with him for that purpose. But
this kind of life was irksome to the Indian
girl, and she was perpetually escaping the
vigilance of her father, to try her arrow in the
woods, or guide her pretty canoe over the
waters. De Rance had long thought it
impossible
to gratify his ambitious views for his
daughter without removing her from the
attractions
of her savage home; and each day's
experience convinced him more and more
of the truth of this conclusion.
To favour his project, he assumed an
affectionate
manner towards his wife; for he well
knew that one look, or word, of kindness,
would at any time win back all her love.
When the deep sensibilities of her warm
heart were roused, he would ask for leave to
sell her lands; and she, in her prodigality of
tenderness, would have given him anything,
even her own life, for such smiles as he then
bestowed. The old chief was dead, and
there was no one to check the unfeeling
rapacity
of the Frenchman. Tracts after tracts
of Tahmiroo's valuable land were sold, and
the money remitted to Quebec, whither he
had the purpose of conveying his children, on
pretence of a visit; but in reality with the
firm intent of never again beholding his
deserted
wife.
A company of Canadian traders happened
to visit the Falls of St. Anthony, just at this
juncture; and Florimond de Rance took the
opportunity to apprise Tahmiroo of his
intention
to educate Victoire. The Sioux
pleaded with all the earnestness of a mother's
eloquence; but she pleaded in vain.
Victoire
and her father joined the company of
traders, on their return to Canada.
Tahmiroo
knelt, and fervently besought that she
might accompany them. She would stay out
of sight, she said; they should not be
ashamed
of her among the great white folks of the
east; and if she could but live where she
could see them every day, she should die
happier.
Ashamed of you! and you the daughter
of a Sioux King! exclaimed Victoire
proudly
,
and with a natural impulse of tenderness,
she fell on her mother's neck and wept.
Victoire, 'tis time to depart, said her
father, sternly. The sobbing girl tried to
release
herself; but she could not. Tahmiroo
embraced her with the energy of despair;
for, after all her doubts and jealousies,
Victoire was the darling child of her bosom
she was so much the image of Florimond
when he first said he loved her.
Woman! let her go! exclaimed de
Rance, exasperated by the length of the
parting scene. Tahmiroo raised her eyes
anxiously to his face, and she saw that his
arm was raised to strike her.
I am a poor daughter of the Sioux; oh!
why did you marry me? exclaimed she, in a
tone of passionate grief.
For your father's land, said the
Frenchman
coldly.
This was the drop too much. Poor
Tahmiroo
,
with a piercing shriek, fell on the
earth, and hid her face in the grass. She
knew not how long she remained there.
Her highly-wrought feelings had brought on
a dizziness of the brain; and she was
conscious
only of a sensation of sickness,
accompanied
by the sound of receding voices.
When she recovered, she found herself alone
with Louis, her little boy, then about six
years old. The child had wandered there
after the traders had departed, and having in
vain tried to waken his mother, he laid
himself
down by her side, and slept on his bow
and arrows. From that hour Tahmiroo was
changed.
Her quiet submissive air gave place to a
stern and lofty manner; and she, who had
always been so gentle, became as bitter and
implacable as the most blood-thirsty of her
tribe. In little Louis all the strong feelings
of her soul were centered; but even her
affection for him was characterized by a
strange, unwonted fierceness. Her only care
seemed to be to make him like his
grandfather
,
and to instil a deadly hatred of white
men. The boy learned his lessons well.
He was the veriest little savage that ever
let fly an arrow. To his mother alone he
yielded any thing like submission; and the
Sioux were proud to hail the haughty child
as their future chieftain.
Such was the aspect of things on the
shores of the Missouri, when Florimond de
Rance came among them, after an absence
of three years. He was induced to make
this visit, partly from a lingering curiosity to
see his boy, and partly from the hope of
obtaining more land from the yielding
Tahmiroo
.
He affected much contrition for his
past conduct, and promised to return with
Victoire, before the year expired.
Tahmiroo
met him with the most chilling
indifference
,
and listened to him with a vacant look,
as if she heard him not.
It was only when he spoke to her boy,
that he could arouse her from this apparent
lethargy. On this subject she was all
suspicion
.
She had a sort of undefined dread
that he, too, would be carried away from
her; and she watched over him like a
she-wolf
,
when her young is in danger. Her
fears were not unfounded; for Florimond de
Rance did intend, by demonstrations of
fondness
,
and glowing descriptions of Quebec, to
kindle in the mind of his son a desire to
accompany him.
Tahmiroo thought the hatred of white
men, which she had so carefully instilled,
would prove a sufficient shield; but many
weeks had not elapsed before she saw that
Louis was fast yielding himself up to the
fascinating power which had enthralled her
own youthful spirit. With this discovery
came horrible thoughts of vengeance; and
more than once she had nearly nerved her
soul to murder the father of her son; but
she could not. Something in his features
still reminded her of the devoted young
Frenchman, who had carried her quiver
through the woods, and kissed the moccasin
he stooped to lace; and she could not kill
him.
The last cutting blow was soon given to
the heart of the Indian Wife. Young Louis,
full of boyish curiosity, expressed a wish to
go with his father, though he at the same
time promised a speedy return. He always
had been a stubborn boy; and she felt now
as if her worn-out spirit would vainly
contend
against his wilfulness. With that sort
of resigned stupor, which often indicates
approaching insanity, she yielded to his
request
;
exacting, however, a promise that he
would sail a few miles down the Mississippi
with her the day before his departure.
The day arrived. Florimond de Rance
was at a distance on business. Tahmiroo
decked herself in the garments and jewels
she had worn on the day of her marriage,
and selected the gaudiest wampum belts for
the little Louis.
Why do you put these on? said the boy.
Because Tahmiroo will no more see her
son in the land of the Sioux, said she,
mournfully
,
and when her father meets her in the
spirit-land, he will know the beads he gave
her.
She took the wondering boy by the hand,
and led him to the water side. There lay
the canoe her father had given her when
she left him for the wigwam of the
stranger
.
It was faded and bruised now, and so
were all her hopes. She looked back on
the but, where she had spent her brief term
of wedded happiness, and its peacefulness
seemed a mockery of her misery. And was
shethe lone, the wretched, the desperate,
and deserted onewas she the Startled
Fawn of the Sioux, for whom contending
Chiefs had asked in vain? The
remembrance
of all her love and all her wrongs
came up before her memory, and death
seemed more pleasant to her than the gay
dance she once loved so well. But then
her eye rested on her boyand, O God!
with what an agony of love! It was the
last vehement struggle of a soul all formed
for tenderness. We will go to the
Spirit-Land
together, she exclaimed. He cannot
come there to rob me!
She took Louis in her arms, as if he had
been a feather, and springing into the boat,
she guided it towards the falls of St.
Anthony
.
Mother, mother! the canoe is going
over the rapids! screamed the frightened
child. My father stands on the waves and
beckons! she said. The boy looked at the
horribly fixed expression of her face, and
shrieked aloud for help.
The boat went over the cataract.
Louis de Rance was seen no more. He
sleeps with the Startled Fawn of the
Sioux
,
in the waves of the Missisippi! The
story is well remembered by the Indians of
the present day; and when a mist gathers
over the falls, they often say, Let us not
hunt to-day. A storm will certainly come;
for Tahmiroo and her son are going over the
falls of St. Anthony.

THE SPIDER, CATERPILLAR, AND
SILK-WORM.
What
sort of a weaver is your
neighbour
,
the Silk-Worm? said a Spider to a
Caterpillar. She is the slowest, dullest
creature imaginable, replied the Caterpillar;
I can weave a web sixty times as quick as
she can. But then she has got her name up
in the world, while I am constantly the
victim
of envy and hatred. My productions
are destroyed, sometimes rudely and boldly,
sometimes with insidious cunning; but her
labours are praised all the world over
mankind
wreath them with flowers, embroider
them with gold, and load them with jewels.
I sympathize with you deeply, said the
Spider; for I too am the victim of envy and
injustice. Look at my web extended across
the window-pane? Did the Silk-Worm ever
do anything to equal its delicate
transparency
?
Yet in all probability to-morrow's sun
will see it swept away by the unfeeling
housemaid. Alas, my sister! genius and
merit are always pursued by envy.
Foolish creatures, exclaimed a
gentleman
,
who overheard their complaints. You,
Mrs. Caterpillar, who boast of your
rapid
performances, let me ask you, what is their
value? Do they not contain the eggs that
will hereafter develope themselves, and
destroy
blossom and fruit?even as the hasty
and selfish writer winds into his pages
principles
wherewithal to poison the young heart's
purity and peace?
As for you, Mrs. Spider, you are hardly
worthy of a rebuke. Your transparent web
is broken by a dew-drop, as some pretty
poetry
is marred by the weight of a single idea.
Like other framers of flimsy snares, you will
catch a few silly little flies, and soon be
swept awaythe ephemera of an hour. But
rail not at productions, which ye cannot
understand
!
How can such as you estimate
the labours of the Silk-Worm? Like genius
expiring in the intensity of its own fires, she
clothes the world in the beauty she dies in
creating.
11A
LINES,
OCCASIONED BY A BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT IN THE MIDST
OF DISTRACTING EMPLOYMENT.
How oft amid perplexing cares,
Fancy comes with her sweetest airs,
And brightest scenes
Like the midnight serenade,
Waking the beauteous maid
From earth-born dreams.
'Tis as if the spirits of thought
Their fair and fragrant wreaths had brought,
From realms above;
But on earth too pure to stay,
Threw but one bright rose away,
To prove their love.
STAND FROM UNDER!
[The following story was told me as one actually
related
by a sailor. I wrote it, not because I believed it
for a moment, but because I supposed it was one of the
numerous traditions among sea-faring people; and I
thought it a fine specimen of that wild and terrible
grandeur
of imagination naturally excited by the solitude and
dangers of the ocean. I have since learned that the
same story, or a similar one, had been previously written
for an English periodical; but never having seen that
story, I cannot be accused of plagiarism, or imitation.]
We
were on board a slave-ship, bound to
the coast of Africa. I had my misgivings
about the business; and I believe others had
them too. We had passed the Straits of
Gibraltar, and were lying off Barbary, one
clear, bright evening, when it came my turn
to take the helm. The ship was becalmed,
and every thing around was as silent as the
day after the deluge. The wide monotony
of water, varied only by the glancings of the
11B
moon on the crest of the waves, made me
think the old fables of Neptune were true;
and that Amphitrite and her Naiads were
sporting on the surface of the ocean, with
diamonds in their hair. Those fancies were
followed by thoughts of my wife, my children,
and my home; and all were oddly enough
jumbled together in a delicious state of
approaching
slumber. Suddenly I heard, high
above my head, a loud, deep, terrible voice,
call out, Stand from under! I started
to my feetit was the customary signal when
any thing was to be thrown from the shrouds,
and mechanically I sung out the usual
answer
,
Let go! But nothing cameI
looked up in the shroudsthere was nothing
there. I searched the deck,and found
that I was alone! I tried to think it was a
dream,but that sound, so deep, so stern, so
dreadful, rung in my ears, like the bursting
of a cannon!
In the morning, I told the crew what I
had heard. They laughed at me; and were
all day long full of their jokes about
Dreaming Tom. One fellow among them
was most unmerciful in his raillery. He
was a swarthy, malignant-looking Spaniard;
who carried murder in his eye, and curses on
his tongue; a daring and lordly man, who
boasted of crime, as if it gave him
pre-eminence
among his fellows. He laughed longest
and loudest at my story. A most uncivil
ghost, Tom, said he; when such chaps
come to see me, I'll make 'em show
themselves
.
I'll not be satisfied without seeing
and feeling, as well as hearing.
The sailors all joined with him; and I,
ashamed of my alarm, was glad to be silent.
The next night, Dick Burton took the helm.
Dick had nerves like an ox, and sinews like a
whale; it was little he feared, on the earth,
or beneath it. The clock struck oneDick
was leaning his head on the helm, as he said,
thinking nothing of me, or my story,when
that awful voice again called from the
shrouds, Stand from under! Dick
darted
forward like an Indian arrow, which they
say goes through and through a buffalo, and
wings on its way, as if it had not left death
in the rear. It was an instant, or more,
before
he found presence of mind to call out
Let go! Again nothing was seen,
nothing
heard. Ten nights in succession, at
one o'clock, the same unearthly sound rung
through the air, making our stoutest sailors
quail, as if a bullet-shot had gone through
their brains. At last the crew grew pale
when it was spoken of; and the worst of us
never went to sleep without saying our
prayers. For myself, I would have been
chained to the oar all my life, to have got
out of that vessel. But there we were in
the vast solitude of ocean; and this invisible
being was with us! No one put a bold face
on the matter, but Antonio, the Spaniard.
He laughed at our fears, and defied Satan
himself to terrify
him
. However, when it
came his turn at the helm, he refused to go.
Several times, under the pretence of illness,
he was excused from a duty, which all on
board dreaded. But at last, the Captain
ordered
Antonio to receive a round dozen lashes
every night, until he should consent to
perform
his share of the unwelcome office. For
awhile this was borne patiently; but at
length, he called out, I may as well die
one way as anotherGive me over to the
ghost!
That night Antonio kept watch on deck.
Few of the crew slept; for expectation and
alarm had stretched our nerves upon the
rack. At one o'clock, the voice called,
Stand from under! Let go!
screamed
the Spaniard. This was answered by
a shriek of laughterand
such
laughter!It
seemed as if the fiends answered each other
from pole to pole, and the bass was howled in
hell! Then came a sudden crash upon the
deck, as if our masts and spars had fallen.
We all rushed to the spotand there was a
cold, stiff, gigantic corpse. The Spaniard
said it was thrown from the shrouds, and
when he looked on it he ground his teeth
like a madman. I know him, exclaimed
he; I stabbed him within an hour's sail of
Cuba, and drank his blood for breakfast.
We all stood aghast at the monster. In
fearful whispers we asked what should be
done with the body. Finally we agreed that
the terrible sight must be removed from us,
and hidden in the depth of the sea. Four
of us attempted to raise it: but human
strength was of no availwe might as well
have tugged at Atlas. There it lay, stiff,
rigid, heavy, and as immoveable as if it
formed
a part of the vessel. The Spaniard was
furious; let me lift him, said he; I
lifted
him once, and can do it again. I'll teach
him what it is to come and trouble me. He
took the body round the waist, and attempted
to move it. Slowly and heavily the corpse
raised itself up; its rayless eyes opened; its
rigid arms stretched out, and clasped its
victim
in a close death-grappleand rolling
over to the side of the ship, they tottered an
instant over the watersthen with a loud
plunge sunk together. Again that laugh,
that wild, shrieking laugh,was heard on the
winds. The sailors bowed their heads, and
put up their hands to shut out the appalling
sound. * * * * * *
I took the helm more than once after, but
we never again heard in the shrouds that
thundering sound, Stand from under.
THE
ADVENTURES OF A RAIN DROP.
When
I was first aware of existence, I
found myself floating in the clouds, among
millions of companions. I was weak and
languid, and had indeed fainted entirely
away, when a breeze from the north was
kind enough to fan me, as it swept along
toward the equator. The moment my
strength was renewed, I felt an irresistible
desire to travel. Thousands of neighbours
were eager to join me; and our numerous
caravan passed rapidly through immense
deserts of air, and landed in the garden of
Eden. I fell on a white rose bush, which
Adam was twining around the arbour where
Eve was sitting; while she thanked him
with her smiles, and shook my companions
from the clusters of grapes she had plucked
for him. I shall never forget the sounds
she uttered! Mankind must have lost the
knowledge of them now, for I never hear
such tones; though, in a few instances,
where childhood has been gifted with a rich,
melodious voice, and I have heard it poured
forth in careless happiness, it has seemed to
me like the language of Paradise.
As it was a cloudy day, and the sun did
not appear, I slipped from a rose leaf to the
bottom of a superb arum, and went quietly
to sleep. When I awoke, the sun was bright
in the heavens, and birds were singing, and
insects buzzing joyfully. A saucy humming
bird was looking down upon me, thinking,
no doubt, that he would drink me up; but a
nightingale and scarlet lory both chanced to
alight near him, and the flower was weighed
down, so that I fell to the ground.
Immediately
,
I felt myself drawn up, as if very
small cords were fastened to me. It was the
power of the sun, which forced me higher
and higher, till I found myself in the clouds,
in the same weak, misty state as before.
Here I floated about, until a cold wind
drove me into the Danube. The moment
I entered this river, I was pushed forward
by such a crowd of water drops, that, before
I knew whither I was bound, I found myself
at the bottom of the Black Sea. An oyster
soon drew me into his shell, where I tumbled
over a pearl, large and beautiful enough to
grace the snowy neck of Eve. I was well
pleased with my situation, and should have
remained a long time, had it been in my
power; but an enormous whale came into
our vicinity, and the poor oysters were rolled
down his throat, with a mighty company of
waves. I escaped from my pearl prison,
and the next day the great fish threw me
from his nostrils, in a cataract of foam.
Many were the rivers, seas, and lakes, I
visited. Sometimes I rode through the
Pacific
,
on a dolphin's back; and, at others, I
slept sweetly under the shade of fan coral,
in the Persian Gulf. One week, I was a
dew drop on the roses of Cashmere; and
another, I moistened the stinted moss on
cold Norwegian rocks.
Years passed away before I again reposed
on the banks of the Euphrates. When I
did, Adam was banished from Eden. Many
a time have I clung to the willows, and
looked in pity on the godlike exile, as he
toiled in the fields, with his children around
him; and, when he sought the shade, again
and again have I leaped down to cool his
feverish brow. Pleasant as I found this
benevolent office, I delighted still more to
nestle among the pretty, yellow ringlets of
the infant Abel, and shine there, like a
diamond on the surface of golden waves.
Alas! it is anguish to remember how I kissed
his silken eyelash, when he lay stretched in
death, under the cruel hand of Cain.
Time rolled slowly on, and the world grew
more wicked. I lived almost entirely in the
clouds, or on the flowers; for mankind could
offer no couch fit for the repose of innocence,
save the babe's sinless lip. At last,
excessive
vice demanded punishment. The
Almighty
sent it in the form of rain; and, in
forty days, the fair earth was overwhelmed.
I was permitted to remain in the foggy
atmosphere
;
and, when the deluge ceased, I
found myself arranged, with a multitude of
rain drops, before the blazing pavilion of the
sun. His seven coloured rays were
separated
in passing through us, and reflected on
the opposite quarter of the heavens. Thus
I had the honour to assist in forming the first
rainbow ever seen by man.
It is now five thousand, eight hundred, and
twenty eight years, since I first came into
being; and you may well suppose that, were
all my adventures detailed, they would fill a
ponderous volume. I have traversed the
wide world over, and watched its inhabitants
through all their infinitude of changes. I
have been in tears on the lyre of Sappho,
when her love-inspired fingers swept across
its strings. In the aromatic bath, I have
kissed the transparent cheek of proud
Aspasia
;
and I have twinkled on Plato's pale,
intellectual brow, when he dreamed his
ethereal
philosophy in her magic bower. I
remained
at the bottom of the cup in which
Cleoptara dissolved her costly pearl; and I
plunged indignantly from the prow of
Antony's
vessel, when he retired from the fight,
and gave the world for beauty.
I have been poured forth within the
dazzling
shrine of Apollo, and mixed with the
rosy libations of Bacchus. The Bramin of
Hindostan has worshipped me in the sacred
stream of Ganges. With me the Druid has
quenched his sacrifice; the Roman pontiff
signed the sacred emblem of the cross; and
the Levite made clean his hands before he
entered within the sanctuary. The princely
archbishops of England have taken me from
magnificent baptismal fonts; and, in the wild
glens of Scotland, the persecuted Covenanter
has sprinkled me on many a guiltless head.
I have jumped from the banyan tree on the
back of a Hindoo god, and glittered on the
marble cheeks of deities in Athens. I have
trembled on the Turkish crescent; slept on
the Russian cross; died on the Chinese
pagoda; and awaked between the Persian
and the sun he adores.
Warm climates have ever been my
favourites
;
for there, I was often in heaven, in a
state of melting, delicious languor; and my
visitations to earth were ever among the
beautiful and the brilliant.
For one hundred years I was doomed to
reluctant drudgery in the cold regions of the
north; during which my soul was sent forth
from gipsy kettles, over the Geysers of
Iceland
,
and embodied again to freeze the head
of the Kamschatkadale to his bear-skin
pillow
.
I could tell wonders of Captain Parry,
and absolutely craze Symmes with my
discoveries
.
I could, if I chose, make known to
hardy adventurers, who have risked life and
limb to ascertain it, whether or not wild
geese summer at the pole; but the giant
king of the glaciers has forbidden me to
reveal
many things, which it is not expedient
for the world to know at present. I dare
not disobey him, for he once enchained me,
in the dreary chambers of an ice mountain,
forty long years; and, had not the huge mass
been seized with the modern spirit of
enterprise
,
and moved southward, I might never
have regained my liberty. The first use I
made of freedom was to revisit the scenes I
had enjoyed so much, when men were
comparatively
strangers on earth. I sought
repose
,
after my wearisome journey, in the
holy stream of Jordan; but scarcely had the
waves given me their welcome embrace, ere
the celebrated Chateaubriand conveyed me
from thence to France, to perform my part
in the august baptism of the infant king of
Rome. For such an office, I was willing
to leave my beloved Palestine; for seldom
have I rested on a boy of loftier promise, or
more cherub loveliness; but I liked not the
service in which the crafty politician
employed
me a few years after. It shames me
to tell that the water sprinkled on the son of
Bonaparte, aided to prepare the vile pages
of Le Roi est mortVive le Roi! with
which the capricious Frenchman afterward
welcomed the tenth Charles of Bourbon.
Disgusted with the servile race of courtiers,
I hastened to England, in hopes of finding
an aristocracy too proud, in their long
inherited
greatness, to sue for the favour of a
never satisfied multitude, or to triumph over
them with all the vulgar superciliousness of
newly acquired power. Few, very few such
I found; for true nobility of soul is rare;
but many a glorious exploit was achieved by
me in that favoured land of intelligence and
freedom. Once, while hovering listlessly in
the air, I aided in forming the rainbow which
Campbell has immortalized in such splendid
verse; and the next day, Wordsworth
apostrophized
me, as I lay quivering on the edge
of his favourite daisy.
I moistened some of the pages of Scott,
before they were wet with the world's tears;
and I trickled from the point of Mrs.
Heman's
pen, when her eloquent spirit held
communion with Tasso. I have evaporated
on the burning page of Byron, and sparkled
on the spangled lines of Moore.
* * * * * *
It would take too long a time to detail all
the services I rendered the great, the gifted,
and the fair, during my residence in the
fast-anchored
isle. Suffice it to say, with all its
advantages, I found much to displease me;
and I was anxious to visit a new republic,
which I had heard of, beyond the ocean,
where the laws are just, and men were
happy
.
This land, too, has its evils; but I
love it better than any spot I have seen in all
12
my wanderings. Niagara has thrown me
forth in spray; and, frozen on its rugged
cliffs, I have seemed like a giant's starting
tear. I have streamed from the Indian oar
into the mighty river of the West, and
slumbered
in the cold blue depths of Canadian
lakes. I frolicked in the joyous little stream
which honest Aunt Deborah Lenox praised
so sensibly, and I formed a part of the
Rivulet
which brought back the happy dream
of childhood to the soul of Bryant; that soul
on whose waveless mirror Nature is ever
reflected
in a placid smile, all radiant with
poetry.
But, in good truth, I have had little leisure
for recreations like these; for rain drops, as
well as every thing else, are pressed into full
employment in this land of business. I have
laboured hard in mills, manufactories, and
distilleries; and died a thousand deaths in
pushing forward the swift sailing boats on the
Hudson and the Mississippi. A few months
since, I rose from the water works of
Philadelphia
,
and soon hovered over the Boston
Athenum. I happened to alight on the
head of a poet, who was just quitting the
gallery, and was scorched to vapour in an
instant. I descended just in time for a
Frenchman to mix me with the eau de
miel, which he was pouring into an elegant
cut-glass vial. A fashionable fop, who
considered
perfume the sovereign'st thing on
earth, presented me to a celebrated belle.
I shall probably die on the corner of her
embroidered
handkerchief; but for me to die,
is only to exist again; of course, my
adventures
will be as long as the world's history.
12A
THE YOUNG WEST-INDIAN.
I am
one of those wayward characters,
whom the philosophic call romantic, and the
money-living, a strange, unaccountable being.
Left with a small patrimony, which a thrifty
man would have increased into affluence, I
chose to indulge my ruling inclination, which
was to see men and manners in every variety
of light and shadow; and after thirty years'
experience, I do not blush at my choice.
Nothing tends so much to ameliorate
personal
character as this kind of passing
collision
with the motley crowd. Our local
prejudices
are overcome by finding the same
great machinery of heart and mind every
where in motion; and the pride of human
nature bows down, at so frequently seeing
the tremendous velocity of excited passion,
destroying the equilibrium of the mightiest
intellect. The thousand trifling instances of
self-denial, which a traveller is called upon
to practise, act on his temper like rolling
friction
,
destroying its inequalities, and polishing
its surface; and the morbid sensibility which
loathes human folly, even in its most
harmless
forms, gradually loses its annoying
power
:
for it needs but brief experience to prove,
that a nerve thrust out at every pore is an
uncomfortable armour for this world's
conflicts
.
Many of my acquaintance pity my
philosophic
enjoyment, and hint that concentrated
affections are more productive of intense
happiness, than such widely diffused interest
possibly can be. Alas! I doubt it not; but
their kindness touches a broken and
voiceless
string. They know not that its melody
has departed; for manhood often endures
with cheerfulness what it neither conquers
nor avows; and if the sun of youthful love,
making heaven so bright and earth so
verdant
,
is obscured by a morning cloud, it is
surely both wise and virtuous to leave the
heart open to the gladdening influence of
others' happiness. At least, during all my
12B
rambles, I have found a good-natured
willingness
to please and be pleased, the
genuine
antidote to all corroding thoughts. The
incidents I have met with have been various,
and in many cases extraordinary. One so
remarkably indicates the finger of an
overruling
Providence, that I cannot forbear
giving
it in all its details.
It was in the summer of 1808, that I sailed
from Cuba, in a merchant-vessel, bound to
Boston. I awoke on board early on a bright
and sunny morning. The sea sparkled as if
dolphins were sporting on its surface; the
sails of the Amphitrite filled; and her prow
rose above the waves, as if she were a gallant
bird eager for her homeward flight; and the
fair Spanish island, wreathed with lemon and
citron, reposed in the distance, like a
beautiful
Naiad on her ocean pillow. We had
dropped down from the wharf during the
night-time, and were waiting the arrival of
passengers from the shore. The sun had
not risen far above the horizon, when, in
answer to a loud and somewhat impatient
signal from the captain, a boat pushed off
from the island. The oars, struck by a
sinewy
arm, left a billowy wake behind them,
fretting and foaming for awhile, but
subsiding
into peacefulness as rapidly as the
excitements
of our early days. The loud strokes
sounded nearer and nearer; presently we
heard the drops trickle from the oars as they
slowly rose from the water, and soon this
was interrupted by a harsh, grating sound,
as the boat rubbed against our larboard side.
A gentleman, with sharp nose and lips closely
compressed, ordered a rope-ladder to be
lowered
for his wife and child. By the united
assistance of her husband's arm from below,
and mine reaching over the quarter deck, a
pale, but very interesting looking woman,
ascended the vessel, and was immediately
followed by a little girl, apparently four or
five years old, whose olive cheek and burning
eye betrayed a Spanish origin. The
gentleman
himself, a few moments after, leaped on
deck, and by his rapid and minute inquiries,
I soon discovered that he was Mr. Reynolds,
a New-England merchant, and chief owner
of the Amphitrite. For one roaming about
the world to catch the few bright rays
wandering
up and down its hazy atmosphere,
nothing could be more fortunate than the
arrival of the lady and her pretty companion.
My heart always warmed toward childhood,
with feelings as bright and pure as that holy
world from whence the stream of tenderness
is poured into the human soul; but I had
never met with a child so attractive as
Angelina
.
Soul shone through her whole face,
and played hide and seek like sunshine on a
rapid stream. It seemed as if a mischievous
elfin now wielded his sceptre from her eye's
diamond thronenow hid himself in the
labyrinth of a dimpleand anon, danced in
the corner of her laughing lip. The deep
brown hue of her cheek, gave a richness and
glow to this light of expression, like the
setting
sun mantling autumnal foliage. Her
long black hair, slightly curling, clung round
her, like a fairy veil of clouds, and gave to
her slender figure that waving outline so
essential
to beauty. Her voice was, as I had
imagined the murmur of oriental fountains,
forever joyful and melodious in its gurgling
sound; and her vivacity was as untiring as
the tiny star-crested bird, feeding on the
acacia's honey-drop, and drinking dew from
the rose-leaf. If a fish sprang from the
water
,
she would clasp her hands, and bound
along the deck, as if her little heart was too
full of joy; and when night slowly gathered
up the folds of her spangled drapery, and
walked through the heavens in her majesty,
she would fix her eyes on the distant star
with such a look of earnestness and
inspiration
,
that I almost imagined the mysterious
fancies of the poet were then streaming in
upon her infant mind. I frequently noticed
a deep and tender melancholy in Mrs.
Reynolds'
eye, as she watched the motions of
this fascinating little being. The look was
like plaintive musican expression of that
quiet, resigned suffering, which the destiny
of woman too often stamps upon her
countenance
;
and it never failed to bring the
sensitive
Angelina to her side, even in her
moments
of most boisterous glee. A few days
after we put out to sea, a bird flew from the
direction where I had told her we left her
native island, and alighted on the main-mast.
Angelina clapped her hands, tossed back her
head, and laughed with such a clear, ringing
sound of joy, that even the cabin boy smiled
with delight. She continued watching the
little warbler, until he spread his wings to
rise in the pure bright atmosphere, and then,
with childish eagerness she shouted, Little
bird! little bird! have you seen brother
Orlando
?
She sighed when the bird
disappeared
among the clouds, and turning,
encountered
one of those exceedingly pathetic
glances with which her friend so often
regarded
her. With sudden impulse she threw
her arm around Mrs. Reynolds' waist, and
gazed in her face with that touching,
indescribable
expression of cherub love, by which
childhood endeavours to sympathize with
sorrows it cannot comprehend. Kiss me,
mamma, said the little innocent; and
perceiving
a tear in her friend's eye, she added,
still more soothingly, will you kiss your
dear Angelina once, mamma? Though
unable to conjecture the cause of the lady's
emotion, I saw plainly that her heart was
struggling with something it would fain
conceal
;
and as she rose, apparently with the
intention of retiring to her cabin, I
respectfully
opened the door, and gently detaining
Angelina by the hand, I persuaded her to
remain on deck with me. Mr. Reynolds, in
the mean time, walked to and fro, with the
most profound indifference to all that was
passing; but as his wife descended the stairs,
he followed her with a more stern and
lowering
look than I had ever seen in his
dead-language
face. A variety of circumstances,
which had occurred since this interesting
family came on board, had strongly excited
my curiosity, and none more than Mr.
Reynolds'
cold and severe manner towards the
lovely beings who were dependent upon him
for kindness and protection. Could it be
possible, I asked myself, that the father
of the beautiful Angelina was the only one
in the ship whose heart did not warm toward
her? No; she must be Mrs. Reynolds'
daughter, by a former, and more beloved
husband. However, politeness forbade my
hinting, directly or indirectly, any of the
thousand conjectures which puzzled my brain
and distressed my heart. I saw no more of
Mrs. Reynolds that day. Towards evening,
when Angelina was sent for from below, she
very reluctantly bade me good night, and
said, I will tell mamma how good you have
been to me, and how many pretty stories
you have told me. Take her to the
cabin
,
said Mr. Reynolds, speaking sharply to
the domesticI think every body does
their best to spoil that child. With as
much politeness as I could assume, I
observed
that such exceeding beauty, united to
the artlessness of infancy, was surely enough
to excite a strong interest in any heart. If
one might judge of your years by your
countenance
,
replied he, it is over late for you
to learn that beauty is a curse, both to her
who owns it, and to him on whom she
confers
it. He said this with much bitterness
of manner, and turned from me with a look
that forbade all further attempts at
conversation
.
A few days before our arrival in Boston,
Angelina came running toward me, as I stood
leaning against the binnacle, and thinking of
the mysterious conduct of him whom I then
supposed to be her father. See, said she,
I asked mamma if I might give you this,
and she says I may, because you are so very
kind to me. She held up a valuable ring
as she spoke. It has my little picture in
it, added sheand she pressed a spring, by
which two golden hands unclasped, and
discovered
an excellent miniature. I kissed
my little favourite, and going up to Mrs.
Reynolds, I placed the ring in her hand,
and smilingly said, your little daughter has
evinced the warmth of her heart by a
present
of most extravagant generosity; but the
remembrance of the little creature who gave
it will be a thousand times dearer to me than
the valuable trinket of which her childish
thoughtlessness was going to deprive you.
It was my wish that Angelina should offer
you this, replied Mrs. Reynolds. I had
two done by different artists of almost equal
merit, during my stay in Cubashe is not
my child, and you have shown a most
uncommon
affection for her; beside, she may
here she looked round timidly, as if
dreading
the approach of her husband, whom I
had left sleeping in the cabinbeside,
continued she, in a lower tone, she may
need assistance from some kind friend, if my
life terminates as speedily as I sometimes
think it will. With all the deference which
her singular situation demanded, I offered
any services in my power. Why I
recommend
her to the protection of a stranger,
instead
ofof my husband, replied the lady,
is an avowal which I cannot make with
either delicacy or dignity, perhaps; but there
is something in your countenance and
manner
which encourages me to confide in you.
I bowed my thanks, and the lady continued.
Angelina is motherless, and her father was
one of my earliest friends. I married Mr.
Reynolds in England; and, on account of
the languid state of my health and spirits, he
two years after carried me to Cuba, and
made arrangements for my stay there during
a long absence in the East-Indies, which
business rendered necessary. I was under
the protection of a widowed aunt of my
husband
,
and lived in a very secluded manner.
Angelina's nurse came to visit one of my
aunt's servants, and brought the child with
her. She was then only two years old, but
her countenance had nearly as much
character
as it now has, and instantly brought to
my mind a Spanish youth who was educated
in England, and in whom my father took
much interest. I eagerly inquired her name,
and when she lisped out Angelina Gindrat,
I for the first time knew that the companion
and playmate of my early days was a wealthy
planter in the island of Cuba. I had heard
of his marriage long before my own took
place,she paused, and blushed deeply at
the inferences which might be drawn from
her embarrassment, then added, but I now
for the first time learned that he was united
to a warm-hearted West Indian girl, who
brought him a fortune almost princely in its
revenues. I soon after became acquainted
with Angelina's charming mother. For one
year we were as sisters; but at the end of
that time, one of these violent fevers so
common
in the Indies, attacked my friend, and
deprived me of her in the short period of four
days. I saw Mr. Gindrat but seldom after
her death; but he confided his daughter to
our care; and when my husband sent me
word that it was his intention to settle in
America, and that I must hold myself in
readiness to sail in the Amphritite, he
earnestly
entreated that I would take his little
girl to Boston, and educate her as if she were
my own. When this was suggested to Mr.
Reynolds, he made no objection, but, on the
contrary, seemed pleased with the child, and
with the idea that the ample remittances
made for her support and education, would
enable us to live in rather more style than
his income warranted. But I know not how
it is, said she, turning her face from me as
she spoke; Mr. Reynolds does not like it,
that I have lost my girlish buoyancy of
spirit
.
He attributes it tomay Heaven
forgive
him for the unjust suspicion which
hardens
his heart against the little Angelina
I cannot talk on this subject, continued she,
dashing away the tears that crowded to her
eyes. I am going entirely among strangers,
and I may die there. Take this ring; should
you hear of my death, see that Mr. Gindrat
is timely informed of it; and on no account
lose sight of the little being for whom you
have shown such uncommon affection. I
readily promised to comply with this
request
.
No more conversation passed at the
time; but the frankness with which she had
trusted to me, warranted me in making every
possible inquiry concerning her young charge.
In the course of several succeeding
conversations
,
I learned that Mr. Gindrat was
in a declining state of health, and that all his
immense property would descend to Angelina
and her brother Orlando. This brother was
a year or two older than his sister, and
exceedingly
attached to her. He was absent
in a distant part of the island when the
Amphitrite
was ready to sail, and our detention
had been occasioned by her father's anxious
desire that his children should embrace each
other, before a separation which he deemed
necessary for his daughter's improvement and
future welfare. Nothing important to my
story occurred during the voyage. Mr.
Reynolds
maintained the same cold and rigid
manner; Mrs. Reynolds, always modest and
dignified in her reserve, seemed involuntarily
to look to me for that kindness which her
desolate feelings so much required; and
Angelina
every hour twined herself more closely
around my affections.
At length Boston appeared in view,
arousing in my mind all the thousand
endearing
associations of home and country.
The joy of a returning traveller was,
however
,
tinged with sadness I could not control,
for I was soon to part with the fascinating
Angelina, and Mrs. Reynolds' words had
given me a sort of fearful foreboding of her
destiny. I made preparations to depart
from the vessel with lingering reluctance.
My farewell to the harsh-tempered merchant
was briefly said, and civilly answered. Mrs.
Reynolds' manner betrayed feelings strongly
repressed, and she looked timidly at her
husband as she said, you must let us see
you in Franklin street. Angelina was
folding up her waxen doll in many coverings,
that it might be safely carried on shore.
The moment she heard good bye, she
threw down her playthings and clasped her
arms around my neck as she said, Are you
going away, and wo'nt you come back to see
Angelina ever again. I hope so, my
love, replied I, fervently kissing her high
ingenuous forehead, but I must go now.
She did not burst into tears, as I had
expected
,
but seating herself, and leaning her
head on her little hand, she heaved a deep,
but long-drawn sigh. The harp of sorrow
utters no note so deeply distressing, so
thrillingly
pathetic, as the sigh of childhood.
Tears and cries are the natural expressions of
their vehement feelings, and they speak grief
as transient as snow flakes in a sunny sky;
but sighs are the language of a heart grown
oldthey are taught by blighted hope and
chilled affection. What has happy childhood
to do with sighs!
This mute sorrow made Angelina dearer
than ever to my heart. I thought then, and
I think now, that a merciful Providence filled
my soul with such exceeding love for the
little
stranger, that I might minister to his own
wise purposes.
13
During a stay of three months in Boston,
I occasionally visited at Mr. Reynolds' house,
and frequently witnessed scenes similar to
those with which I have already made the
reader acquainted. My visits were shorter
and less frequent than they would have been
in a happier family; for the sorrows of a
young and evidently much-abused wife, were
dangerous to sympathize with, and
impossible
to alleviate.
At the end of the time I have mentioned,
business demanded my presence at the
lead-mines
in Missouri. I called to bid farewell
to my friends in Franklin street, promising to
see them the moment I returned. Mr.
Reynolds
was more kind to my favourite than I
had ever before seen him; and Mrs.
Reynolds
seemed happy in the hope that her
artless witchery would eventually overcome
the sternness of his nature. Angelina,
accustomed
to my absence for weeks, regarded my
departure as a common occurrence, and
abated nothing of her charming vivacity.
Never shall I forget how she looked as she
stood watching at the window to see my
carriage
turn from the door. The sunlight was
reflected from a crimson curtain on her
sweet face, so full of affection that its image
was a talisman of comfort for many a long
year after.
It required no effort to keep the promise I
had made. I had scarcely been in Boston
one hour after my return, when I found
myself
opposite Mr. Reynolds' house, watching
the windows with throbbing eagerness. The
smiling figure I expected to see was not
there. I rang the bell impatiently, asked
the servant in a hurried tone, Is Mrs.
Reynolds
at home, and pressed forward with an
impetuosity which my sense of decorum
could not restrain. Sir, replied the
servant
,
she has been dead this fortnight.
Dead! I exclaimed. Yes sir, she is
dead. And where is Angelina? How is
the little West-Indian girl? She died two
days after. They were both attacked with
a malignant fever, and died in the country.
The blow fell upon me with such stunning,
stupifying force, thought and feeling seemed
suspended. Reeling and dizzy with misery
13A
I could not realize, I inquired for Mr.
Reynolds
.
He is at the compting-room,
replied
the domestic; but walk into the
parlour, sir, you are very pale. He opened
the door, and, hardly knowing what I did, I
entered. There hung the crimson curtain,
just as it had hung when I saw the little face
I loved so well, peeping from behind its folds.
Then, indeed, memory came upon my heart
in a rush of agony. The numbness was
taken from my soul, and I felt the full extent
of my affliction. I will not describe the
remainder
of that day. Those who have ever
loved strongly, and lost the object of their
affections
,
will imagine, more vividly than
words can portray, that terrible void in the
human soul, when the earth is a wilderness,
and the heavens shrouded in blackness. It
was not until several days after, that I could
see Mr. Reynolds, talk of their death, and
visit their graves. I lingered long on the
spot where they told me the suffering wife
and the joyful little innocent slept side by
side. It is ever thus, thought I, the
brightest and fairest buds are soonest
removed
to the paradise of God. Happy, happy
are those who never know the autumn-leaf
of feeling, the chill drear atmosphere of a
desolated heart.
* * * * * * * *
When I lost the object of my early
attachment
,
a few days before the solemn
marriage-vow
was to connect us forever, for weal or
woe, I had found change of scene one of the
best restoratives for my wounded and restless
spirit; and now that my clinging affections
were a second time driven from their strong
hold, I resorted to the same means of cure.
I visited France and England, and made
myself
familiar with most of the scenes
consecrated
by history or tradition. I remained
abroad nearly nine years, during which time
I saw announced in the public papers the
death of Mr. Gindrat, the father of my
lamented
little friend; and heard several
particulars
of Mrs. Reynolds' history. The
Spanish youth, as she called him, was, as I
suspected, her first lover; and he had gained
her heart at that enthusiastic period when it
clings to a dear object with a strength which
13B
bids defiance to the subtle power of interest,
or the tempting signal of ambition. When
his education was finished, he married a
West-Indian heiress. His English playmate
heard of his union, and from that time cared
little whether her path of life were in
sunshine
or shadow. She never, even in her
inmost thought, reproached Mr. Gindrat.
The world excused him from blame because
he had made no open declaration, and had,
of course, broken no vows; but is a cold,
spiritless morality which dictates a creed like
this. He who makes his eyes telegraphs of
a love he does not utter, and, by a thousand
unnecessary attentions, wreaths himself more
closely around a heart that cherishes his looks
and records his minutest actions, is
answerable
for the blight and mildew of that heart.
Some said this was the view Mr. Gindrat
himself took of the subject; and that the
tacit compact he had broken, cast a shade of
melancholy over his future life. Angelina
Lee, for such was Mrs. Reynolds' name,
gave no indications of misery which a
common
observer would have noticed; but she
lost her interest in what was around her, and
seemed to act the cheerfulness she no longer
felt. Her father was anxious to see her
married
,
for a reason more powerful than the
world suspected; the irretrievable
embarassment
of his fortune. Mr. Reynolds, a stern,
vindictive, unprincipled, but gallant man,
had long been struck with her beauty, and
had an eye upon her expected fortune. He
offered his handher father urged his claims
and partly from a listlessness of spirit
which shrunk from contention with her
father's
willand partly from that love of
homage which exists more or less in every
heart, she consented to become his wife.
Had his love for her been genuine, all would
have been well; for kindness will cure most
mental diseases; but he was vexed at her
father's loss of property, and put no check
upon his harsh, tyrannical nature. The idea
that disappointed affection occasioned his
wife's ill health, and the unjust suspicion that
she knew of her former lover's residence in
Cuba, before she expressed a wish to go
there, increased this evil to the utmost; and
a more cruel and dreadful suspicion with
regard
to the nature of her affection for
Angelina
,
infuriated his hatred toward the child,
although his grasping avarice would not allow
him to relinquish the care of one so opulent.
I have already told how happily they both
escaped from his tyranny; and as nothing
connected with the young West-Indian
transpired
until after my return to America, I
must beg the reader to pass over this long
period, and allow his imagination to
accompany
me on one of the first excursions I
made in my native land, in the autumn of
the year 1817.
Several of my friends having heard that
there was plenty of game at Weston and
Sudbury, proposed to collect a shooting
party to ascertain the truth of the report. A
mere love of rambling induced me to join
them; for Cowper had so early inspired me
with a reluctance to take away life, that all
the boasted excellencies of Joe Mantons and
percussion caps could never tempt me to be
a sportsman. I had heard that something in
commemoration of one of King Philip's
numerous
battles was to be found in this
neighbourhood
;
and the love of seeking out all
that our infant country dignifies with the
name of antiquities, soon led me to desert a
scene where I could neither gratify taste nor
display skill. My companions humoured my
wayward propensities by pointing out the
direction of the place, and promising to be
altogether independent of me in their
homeward
arrangements, should my long stay
render
it necessary. The route they indicated
led over fence and wall, brake and brier. I
wandered on until I grew weary of hobbling
over potato fields, like a boy stumbling
through the first pages of Virgil, and
climbing
slope after slope, like a man condemned
to the tread-mill. Seeing a lad in the high
road, dragging lazily along after a couple of
sleepy oxen, I hastened to overtake him, and
inquire where Wadsworth's monument was
to be found. Whir-ho, shouted the
yeoman
,
in sharp and angular tones, at the same
time laying his whip parallel with the eyes
of his oxen. What might you say, sir?
I asked you to tell me where the
monument
is. I don't remember hearing of
any monerment in these parts, replied the
lad, tipping his hat on one side in a very
knowing way, and passing his brawny fingers
through his stiff red hair, till his skull bore
no small resemblance to an enchanted
haystack
,
but I've read in the prints that
they 're going to put up a monerment at
Washington that 'll cost uncle Sam a power
o' dollars. What I was speaking of,
answered I, is a memorial of Wadsworth
and Bruklebank, massacred in King Philip's
wars. According to my idees, replied
my informer, a memorial is another guess
sort o' thing from a monerment. Dad sent
a memorial to uncle Sam, about losing one
of his toes in the old war; but it 'ill be long
enough afore dad has a monerment, I guess.
Can you or can you not tell me where the
place is? repeated I, half vexed and half
amused with the ignoramus. That
depends
a bit upon what place you mean. I
guess as how you 're from Boston. Some
how or other, they hear of all sorts of things
down there. Seeing I was not likely to gain
any information, and shrewdly suspectin
the follow had that mischievous love of
hoaxing
his city brethen, so common in the
interior
,
I passed briskly on, but was soon
stopped
by a shrill halloo, mister! if so be
there is such a place round here, our
schoolmaster
can tell you all about it. He's a
curous man for larning. If you was to ax
him, `can't you tell me where sich a place
is?' and he was to say, `no,' he'd mean yes.
How so? asked I, that's no proof of his
wisdom. But it is though; for you see
there's a negative in your question, and if
there was a negative in his answer, it would
be double you seeand the grammar'd stand
him out in saying, that 'are was an
affirmative
.
Smiling at this parade of scholastic
lore, I inquired where the redoubtable
pedagogue
resided. Why he boards round, sir,
because the town can't afford to pay his
board; but he's a curous larnt manhe
could tell you the latitude of your tongue,
and the longitude of your head, if you axed
him. Your tongue has pretty great
latitude
,
I think, sir, replied I. Not up to
the longitude o' my head, I count, said the
buffoon, tipping a wink with that odd mixture
of impudence, vulgarity and archness,
peculiar
to those who style themselves crank
country lads.
What more his wit or his wisdom might
have chosen to amuse me with, I know not
for he stopped his conversation, and
pointing
to a dilapidated farm-house, exclaimed,
there's uncle Joe's house. I guess the
master lives there. If he an't at home,
maybe
uncle Joe can tell you about the
monerment
.
Then whistling to his oxen to
quicken their pace, he, without further
ceremony
,
left me to my adventures. I found
all attempts to make myself heard at the front
door of the mansion entirely useless; and I
continued walking round and round the
domains
,
until half a dozen brick-red milk-pans,
a strainer spread over a wooden pail, and a
checked apron drying on a plough-handle,
gave indications of an inhabitated country.
In answer to my knock, I heard a sharp,
shrill voice call out, Go to the door, Joe.
But a laconic walk! uttered in tones as
deep and gruff as the bass notes of a frog's
organ, was the only notice taken of the sharp
command. Doubtful as the word was in its
import, and ungracious in its utterance, I
thought best to understand it in its most
hospitable sense. Accordingly raising the
wooden latch by a leathern string, somewhat
slippery from many a greasy touch, I
ventured
to explore the interior of the building.
It certainly had not the recommendation
which plain exteriors frequently have. A
pumpkin-shell full of cobbs, surmounted by
a pair of broken bellows; one andiron
beheaded
,
and the other sinking down beneath
the weight of years; towels which an
antiquary
might have sworn were stripped from
Egyptian mummies, and a floor that could
never again be frightened into paleness by
mop, or broomall proclaimed that neatness
and comfort were strangers there.
When I made known my errand, the old
man laid his pipe in the ash-hole, and
thrusting
his hands into his ragged pockets, to
which his idle fingers owed a heavy rent, he
saidThe school-master an't to home;
but I guess I can go with youif you'll wait
till I've split some wood, and hung on the
tea-kettle for my old woman. The matron,
who had wiped her spectacles on a tattered
silk handkerchief, and stared at me to her
heart's content, here answered in her
sharpest
tones, no you won't I can tell you, Joe.
You an't a fit man to be out o' the sight o'
your chimly, as long as grog's made o'
potatoes
.
When that lazy witch of a Peg comes
home from the meadow, she can show the
stranger gentleman the way; for she and
Master Dudley know all the out-o'-the-way
places hereabouts. Wherever she's
lagging
,
I'll be bound he's with her. Well I
hope good'll come on't. That's all I've got
to say. While she was speaking, I noticed
from the window a young man, bearing a
well-filled bag on his shoulder, coming toward
the house in earnest conversation with a
barefooted
,
ill-dressed girl. There's our Peg,
exclaimed the old virago, taking off her
spectacles in a desperate hurry:It's jest
as I knowed 'twould be. A moment after,
the object of her irritation entered, and
chained
my attention as if by a magic spell.
Her ragged straw bonnet had fallen back
from her forehead, and through one of its
loop-holes a sun-beam darted on the most
brilliant eyes I had ever beheld, and gave
additional richness to dark cheeks, highly
flushed by air and exercise. Her movements
had nothing of rustic angularity; on the
contrary
,
there was a gliding gracefulness of
manner which her coarse and narrow dress
could not entirely fetter.
In truth, thought I, this forlorn place
seems much unlike a paradise of poverty;
but if it were, thou, my pretty damsel, might
surely be its angel. She blushed and
smiled
as she met my glance of delighted
surprise
;
and at that moment she looked so
like Angelina standing beneath the crimson
curtain, that I would fain have clasped her to
my heart.
The delightful dream was interrupted by a
sharp reprimand from the old woman, for
having been so tardy in filling the bag with
cranberries. She concluded by sayingI
guess we shall make a profitable spot o' the
work o' taking Master Dudley to board. I
involuntarily glanced toward the young man
to whom she alluded. His countenance
pleased me exceedingly, though his features
were far from handsome. A slight degree
of sadness tinged an expression remarkably
ingenuous and intellectual, and made his face
the sun-dial of the soul, where genius might
mark all its changes in alternate sunshine and
shadow.
With a voice and manner which indicated
the respect he had inspired, I asked him to
accompany me to the spot consecrated by
King Philip's battle. He readily complied
with my request, assuring me that it was just
beyond the neighbouring meadow. The old
man had meekly resumed his pipe, and
languidly
nodded his head in answer to my
parting
salutation. The old woman was busily
emptying her cranberries, and did not notice
that, as we left the house, the eyes of the
young people met, and spoke volumes at a
glance. Surely the eye is the vocabulary of
disembodied spirits; for human sounds have
never yet been able to define its rapid
comprehensive
language. Responding to his
thoughts as if they had been uttered, I
observed
,
that young girl possesses singular
beauty. Yes, answered Mr. Dudley,
and talents still more extraordinary. She
is but fourteen years old, and has never had
advantages superiour to those afforded by
my school; yet you would be astonished at
her instinctive sense of all that is sublime or
beautiful. There was a dignified
enthusiasm
in the speaker's manner, which
confirmed
the favourable impression I had received
from his countenance. This is no place
for such minds, answered I; pardon me
if I ask why you bury your talents here.
Why not come forward and join in the
honourable
competition of intelligent men?
Poverty, a chain which has kept down
many spirits more ambitious than my own,
first brought me here, rejoined he; and
pity for the poor girl you have just seen,
induces
me to remain. In what way can
your residence here benefit her, said I.
I should think it might possibly prove
injurious
to you both. I understand you,
replied he, colouring deeply. The
interest
I have taken in her is honourable and
disinterested, and precisely such as would
have been awakened in any mind, acquainted
with her desolate situation and extraordinary
gifts. With tears in her eyes, she last winter
entreated me to teach her occasionally
during
the long evenings, that she herself might
soon be qualified to instruct. I promised I
would. I found in her an uncommon facility
in acquiring knowledge; and cost me what
it will, I will not leave her till she is able by
her own exertions to throw off the yoke of
unfeeling tyranny which now bows her to
the earth. Are not her grand-parents
kind to her, then, inquired I. They are
no relations of her's, rejoined Dudley.
Their name is Hager, her own is Margaret
Williams. She was brought here, when
about four years old, by a gentleman who
called himself Vinton. He paid her board
until she was eight years old; but since that
time they have heard nothing from him, and
all inquiries for such a man have proved
fruitless
.
Her work has been worth something
to them, so they have not turned her adrift
upon the world; but the scanty pittance she
receives is given grudgingly enough. The
state of things within doors, said I, does
not indicate so much energy as you represent
Margaret to possess. She is the slave,
and not the superintendant there, answered
he. Besides, what is human nature
without
motives to impel it to exertion? No
thanks reward her toilno smile of
approbation
shows that her carefulness is notedbut
I forget, you are a strangerand here we
are by the side of what is called the
monument
.
A rude pile of earth and bricks, against
which leaned a stone bearing the date of the
battle, and the names of Bruklebank,
Wadsworth
,
&c. was all that marked the spot. In
my eyes it was more venerable than many a
lofty pile I had seen in foreign abbeys. They
spoke the idle pageantry of regal folly, or
commemorated the mad projects of
unprincipled
ambition; but this was one of the
humble
memorials of our forefathersmen of
obscure rank, yet born to a lofty destiny
outposts from the vanguard of our youthful
14
nation, yet volunteers who threw themselves
across the pit-falls in her dangerous path,
and bade the car of liberty crush them in its
onward course.
At another time, I should have given
myself
up longer to these heart-stirring
recollections
;
but I was really touched by the
details I had just heard, and I plainly saw
the feelings of my young companion were
wounded by my seeming coldness. After
walking a few steps from the monument, in
silence, I said, you must excuse a blunt old
bachelor, Mr. Dudley, if he does ask such
an abrupt question, as, what do you mean to
do with yourself hereafter? The only
definite purpose I have, replied the young
man, is to obtain a liberal education, if
possible. My course will be guided by the
leadings of Providence. Why do you not
go to West Point? said I. Because I
have neither friends, nor influence, rejoined
he. It has been my favourite project, I
acknowledge; but alone and unassisted as I
am in the world, it would be presumption in
me to hope for it. I like your looks and
your sentiments, young man, replied I,
and it shall not be my fault if your
ambitious
wishes are not fulfilled. As for that
charming Margaret, who has awakened your
pity so much, if you are not afraid to trust
her to an old fellow like me, I will support
her at the best school in Boston for three
succeeding years. Mr. Dudley looked at
me a moment, as if he wished to penetrate
my very soul, and said, if you mean as you
say, sir, may heaven bless you for the
thought. I do mean as I say, rejoined I.
I am alone in life, with an easy fortune, and
I find the bank of benevolence pays me the
largest dividend of happiness.
Mr. Dudley seemed to forget my promises
concerning West Point, but he talked of
what Margaret Williams might be made by
education, and thanked me for my purposes
towards her, with a fervent gratitude, which
renewed my own youthful affections.
When we returned to Mr. Hagar's
miserable
dwelling, we found every thing much as
we had left it, excepting that the hearth was
neatly washed, and the supper-table spread
14A
in quite an orderly manner. Having asked
the good dame's leave to share their repast,
I began to talk of the subject which had so
much interested Mr. Dudley on his walk
homeward. When I asked Margaret if she
would accompany me to Boston, and go to
school there, she looked timidly first at me,
and then at Mr. Dudley, and covering her
face with both her hands, burst into tears.
The old man seemed somewhat moved, and
said the poor orphan was welcome to a
corner
of his house so long as he lived. Which
won't be long, at the rate you've gone on of
late years, rejoined his wife. Peggy has
been a bill of expense to us long enough;
and it's a hard case to have her go off as
soon as she's good for something. I will
satisfy you in that respect, good woman,
said I; we shall not quarrel about the
terms, if Margaret will but say she will go
with me. You are a stranger to us, sir,
resumed the matron; but doubtless you have
good reasons for taking such a violent liking
to Peggy. His stainless reputation is no
stranger to me, said Mr. Dudley, though
I have never seen his person before. The
name of* * *is associated with too many
generous deeds, not to be known at the
remotest
corners of Massachusetts. Then
you think I had better go, said Margaret.
Most certainly I do, replied Mr. Dudley.
And will you say yes, now? said I,
affectionately
passing my hand over her long
black hair, as she stood beside me. The
poor orphan sunk kneeling at my feet, and
wept in the full gratitude of her heart, till
even her stern mistress turned towards the
window, to conceal her tears. I raised her
up with many assurances of kindness and
protection
;
she continued to weep, till, as I held
her hand within mine, her eye glanced upon
Angelina's ring. The eager curiosity with
which she regarded it, called to my mind,
what her height and womanly bearing had
well nigh made me forget, that she was but
a childan artless, uncultured child! I
touched the spring and revealed the miniature
of my little favourite. Oh, it is very
beautiful
,
exclaimed she. You never saw
such a ring before, I suppose? said I.
14B
NoI don't think I ever did, replied she,
speaking in a very slow and hesitating
manner
.
She gazed in the fire very thoughtfully
for a moment, then sighing deeply, looked
in my face with an expression so like
Angelina's
,
when I first bade her farewell on board
the Amphitrite, that I felt determined she
should henceforth be my daughter. Once,
the wild idea did cross my brain, that she
was strangely like my lamented favourite, and
that the news of her death might all have
been a deception. But I had been at her
grave, I had heard the servants talk of the
burial, and the nurse describe her last
moments
;
and I smiled that imagination should
try to play such wild freaks with me.
For various reasons, I deemed it prudent
to remain at the farm-house that night, rather
than expose myself and my interesting
protege
to the curiosity, and perchance the
jests, of my companions. I knew that my
oddity had long since placed me in an
easy-chair
for life; and that my friends were
willing
to grant me as much liberty as they did
their favourite dogs; allowing me to strike
off into as many by-paths as I chose, and
return
when and how I could.
I will not detail the various instances of
avarice and hard-heartedness, which were
elicited during the bargain I made with Mrs.
Hagar. Suffice it to say, the sum I
promised
to pay her, as an indemnification for
Margaret's
services, was certainly much larger
than I should willingly have given, had not
the country maiden so powerfully reminded
me of the fascinating little West-Indian. To
be brief, I seated Margaret beside me in the
stage, the following morning, claiming from
Mr. Dudley a promise to visit us in a few
weeks. I will own all my errors first,
said he smiling; and then if you forgive
me, I shall feel proud to avail myself of your
invitation. I knew you by report, and I told
you Margaret's story, in hopes your quick
feelings and ready benevolence might be
aroused in her behalf. I thank you for
the stratagem, said I, warmly shaking him
by the hand. Unless your own conduct
alters my opinion of you, you will find me an
active friend. A few kind words to the
tearful Margaret, accompanied by a present
of Allan Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd, closed
the farewell scene. As for the old people,
they showed little emotion, except a vulgar
curiosity and wonder at my unaccountable
interest in their Peggy. To part from such
a home could not be very afflicting to any
heart. For a few days Margaret was
melancholy
,
and more than once I found her in
tears over the Gentle Shepherd; but she
soon became gayer than I had imagined it
was in her nature to be. All that Mr.
Dudley
had said of her genius was more than
verified. It seemed as if she were gifted
with an additional sense, a sort of spiritual
ear, to which every waving flower and
bending
shrub spoke strange melody. Her
progress
was so rapid, that Mr. ****'s adopted
daughter soon became the wonder of the
whole school. Before two years had expired,
I received a letter from Mr. Fitzroy, a rich
planter in South-Carolina, entreating that
Miss Williams might return home with his
daughter, who was about to leave school.
Margaret's deference and modest affection
had made her exceedingly dear to me; but
thinking that a visit to the south, under such
patronage, and with such a young lady as I
knew her friend to be, would be a great
advantage
to her, I consented that she should
visit Carolina for one year. During this
time, I frequently received letters from her,
always full of deep, poetic fancy, and the
most enthusiastic, grateful affection. If the
reader finds it difficult to imagine so sudden
a change of character, I assure him it was no
less wonderful to me than it is to him.
There are minds which seem to have an
instinctive
perception of all that is tasteful and
refined; and Margaret's was such. She had,
as it were at once, grown a tall, beautiful,
graceful girl, and had become the pride of a
foolish old heart, that at first clung to her in
pity. And where was the poor youth who
at first revealed the treasures hidden in her
heart and mind? He was at West Point.
And when Margaret made her visit to the
south, his name stood highest among that
celebrated band, which has so happily united
the courtliness of the drawing-room with
the dignified refinement of intellectual
pursuits
like
a mighty citadel, around which
the woodbine falls in accidental profusion,
giving lightness to its outline, without
concealing
its strength.
* * * * * * *
The reader is, I suppose, well nigh weary
of following me in my rambles, now pausing
by the road-side to dissect a thistle, and anon
passing over whole fertile gardens without a
glance; but thus have I done in life, and
thus must he suffer me to do in my story, if
he ever wishes to hear its conclusion.
A letter from Margaret, dated in the
autumn
of 1820, informed me that Mr. Fitzroy,
his daughter, and herself, were about making
a northern tour, and wished very much that
I should join them at New-York. I was not
certain, at the time, I should be able to do
this; but I promised to meet them on their
return. About a week after they left the
city, I arrived there, and immediately took
passage in the steam-boat, on the North
River
,
thinking I should hear of them at
West-Point
,
Lake George, or some other of the
places, which I knew they intended to take
in their route. The passengers were, as
usual, an odd assemblage of all sorts of
nations
,
tribes, and tongues. A half facetious,
half fretful, old yankee was complaining
bitterly
of the noise, and telling the captain he
ought to keep padlocks for the eyes in a
place like that; a Frenchman was tapping
his box with the most graceful air, and
annoying
every body with his snuff and his
voulezvous
;
an Irishman, in his uncouth national
sounds, was most eloquently describing the
death of Emmett; and a little Dutch
woman
with three chubby children, poured forth
a continual torrent of words as unmusical as
the rattling of a coal-cart over the pavements
of a city. Apart from all, sat a handsome,
but very dark-complexioned, young man,
completely absorbed in the enchanting pages
of Ivanhoe. He raised his eye as I stepped
on deck, but its long, dark lash fell almost
instantly
.
I took up a newspaper, and
glancing
over its columns for a time, left the
interesting stranger to pursue his delightful
occupation in peace. It was long before he
closed the volume, and in a silvery, flute-like
voice, made some casual remark concerning
the beauty of the day. This observation
was a very common one; but the words
were arranged with such unstudied elegance,
and his pronunciation had so much of music
about it, that my attention was immediately
excited.
There is a sort of free-masonry by which
intelligent and highly cultivated souls form a
rapid knowledge of each other. The
conversation
soon passed to interesting subjects. A
fine head of Cicero, which I noticed on his
watch-seal, led to gems, and cameos, and
Herculaneum, and the curiously carved ring,
said to have been found there. On every
topic, his rich, classical mind, poured itself
out with the same delightful yet
unostentatious
enthusiasm. We are sinning against
nature, said he, smiling, to be talking of
antiquity, when such a scene of imposing
grandeur is presented to our view. My
eye followed him as he pointed to the
Highlands
,
which were now before us; `some of
the heights swelling in gradual and noble
elevation
from the bank of the river; others
rising from the water in a perpendicular
mass, and starting into sharp and pointed
bluffs, as if thrown up there by the hand of
art. The noble river stole along in fearful
silence, as if sensible of the frowning majesty
which looked down upon its motion;' and
the vessel, rapidly `walking the water like a
thing of life,' seemed proud of her
magnificent
pathway. The little waves sporting
and sparkling round her prow, the soft,
silvery
,
sunny stream, trembling in her rear,
and the wreaths of smoke rising as if in
incense
to the beauty of the scene, all
conspired
to make a steam-boat passing the
Highlands
one of the grandest objects I had ever
seen. Soon the fortifications and buildings
of West Point burst upon the view. At first
we caught a distant glimpse of glittering arms,
and then of the youthful band standing forth
in all the pride of military discipline, as if
ready for the work of death. I had no idea
of such scenery in America, exclaimed the
stranger. It brings to my eye the wild
picturesque, and sublime scenes which
Scotland's
great magician has imprinted on my
imagination. And yet, replied I, it
stands in its own simple majesty, without any
of that pageantry of association which throws
such enchantment around Europe and Asia.
Every thing about your country has to the
philosophic mind associations of moral
grandeur
,
rejoined he, though destitute of the
gorgeous blazonry of chivalry, or the wild
romance of the crusades. You are then
a foreigner? said I. I am so, replied
he, in every country; for I have been too
much a wanderer to call any place my home;
perhaps England best deserves that
appellation
.
I seemed to have aroused melancholy
recollections
.
A cloud passed over the clear
expression of his face, and he was silent for
several moments. Wishing to give a more
pleasant turn to the conversation, I slipped
my ring from my finger, and handing it to
him, I said, we were speaking of ancient
rings just nowthere is one of very curious
workmanship. As the hands unclasped,
he sprang up with an exclamation that pierced
my very brain. In the unconscious power
of strong emotion he grasped my arm, till the
veins swelled beneath his pressure. It was
an instant before he could summon steadiness
enough to say, Oh, tell me whence came
that ring! When he was a little calmer, I
told him its history as briefly as possible, for
my curiosity was strongly excited to know
the cause of such vehement interest. He
listened with varied, but intense, expression
as I proceeded, and suddenly interrupted me
by exclaiming, and where is that little
West-Indian girl? Oh, sir, I'd give you
wealth enough to buy a thousand
consciences
,
if you could but tell me where she is!
The interesting little creature has been
twelve years in her grave, said I; but may
I ask who it is that thus cherishes her
memory
?
I am her brother Orlando, replied
he, and I have a tale of fearful wickedness
to tell you, about the charming companion
of my infancy; but I have not time to detail
it now. The boat is slackening her course
and makes for the shore. I land at West
PointI trust you do too. I answered
that such was my intention, and made hasty
preparations to quit the boat. My curiosity
was so painfully excited, that I could hardly
wait until the possession of a private room at
the lodging house gave him an opportunity
to explain his meaning.
I left Cuba for England, soon after my
sister went to America, he resumed; and
there I continued until after my father's
death. I remained abroad and travelled even
into the interiour of Asia, partly from a love
of adventure, and partly because no fire-side
endearments awaited me in Cuba. During
my childhood, I received letters from Mr.
Reynolds, informing me of my sister's health
and progress in her education. Afterwards
I received letters from herself which
indicated
entire contentment with her situation. It
is not a year since I received one, in which
she excused a draft upon our agent for a very
large sum, by saying she found great calls
upon her benevolence. I was glad she
possessed
this spirit. I answered the letter by
a promise to be in Boston during the summer
of 1820. I cameI eagerly inquired for
Mr. Reynolds. The merchants said he had
called in his debts very rapidly, left his affairs
half settled, started very suddenly for
Calcutta
,
and been shipwrecked. I asked for
Angelina, and was assured she died soon
after she came to this country, and the
grave-stone bearing her name and age was
then shown to me. The villain,
exclaimed
I; he concealed it, that he might
appropriate her property to his own use!
Oh, I could forgive him that, cried the
brother, almost convulsively; yes, I could
have forgiven him if he had taken the last
shilling of my fortune; butthe child still
livesand I cannot discover her! The
prooftell me the proof, said I. I
searched out one of the old servants, he
replied, that I might learn all the
particulars
of my sister's illness. At first she shook
her head mysteriously, and said she believed
there had been some strange doings; and at
last I induced her to tell me the old nurse
had, on her death-bed, confessed that the
child which slept under that grave-stone was
not Angelina Gindrat, but her own daughter;
that Mr. Reynolds had paid her handsomely
for the deception; and that she believed the
little West-Indian was put out at service in
the country. Further than this, all my
inquiries
have been fruitless. I cannot
discover
the least trace of my injured sister;
and I am roaming about the country with a
sort of indefinite hope that Providence will
lead me to a discovery of her retreat. A
sudden light came upon my mind, like an
electric flash; and I was just on the point of
saying, your hope is realized! but
recollecting
the extreme uncertainty of my
conjectures
,
and the cruelty of exciting vain
expectations, I checked the tumult of my
feelings, and asked if there were any
peculiarity
by which he should know his sister.
In my boyhood, answered he, I pricked
upon her right arm a carrier-dove, with a
letter in his mouth; and on the day she bade
me farewell, she held it to my lips and bade
me kiss it. I well recollected it, for
Angelina
had a hundred times talked of Orlando's
little bird. Much conversation followed. I
advised Mr. Gindrat to remain at West Point
a short time, as he would, in all probability,
see many strangers there, and by some
extraordinary
accident, light might gleam on
this singular story; but I did not venture to
express a hope which amounted almost to
entire conviction. He consented to follow
my advice, and I left him, to communicate
with all speed, my hopes and fears to young
Dudley. The Cadet gave me a reception
exceedingly cordial and enthusiastic. To
see you at any time, is happiness for me,
said he, but now, you are the very man, of
all the world, I most wished to see; for I
have lately received a commission from Miss
Williams to find you, at all events, and bring
you into her presence at the military ball,
which is to be at New-York, the ensuing
week. You are such a bird on the wing,
that I have despatched letters to
Philadelphia
,
Canandaigua, and New-York, which
are the three last places from whence your
letters have been dated, in hopes some one
of them would reach you. As soon as the
bustle of meeting was over, I told him all
with which the reader has been made
acquainted
,
15
and expatiated very largely upon
my belief that Angelina Gindrat and
Margaret
Williams were one and the same person.
I was a little disappointed at the calmness,
and even sadness, with which Mr. Dudley
heard my disclosure; and I reproached him
for want of sympathy in my daughter's good
fortune. I will deal frankly with you,
replied the young man. As your adopted
child, admired and flattered by the rich and
intelligent, I have long felt that my hold
upon
her remembrance was exceedingly
precarious
;
but if she is heiress to this immense
fortune, her hand will soon be sought by
numbers, superior to me in all respects. I
have no right to answer for Margaret's
feelings
,
rejoined I, but of one thing I am
certain: this change of fortune will make no
change in her romantic nature. This
assurance
somewhat dispelled his gloom, and
having naturally the slightest possible
degree
of selfishness in his disposition, he soon
entered with enthusiasm into all my hopes
and fears. When I asked him if he had ever
heard Mrs. Hagar describe the Mr. Vinton
who left Margaret with them, he answered
that he had. In every respect the
description
corresponded with my vivid recollection
of Mr. Reynolds. A thousand trifling details
tended so much to confirm my suspicions,
that my eagerness to meet Margaret grew
painful in its excess. Report said that the
great southern beauty, Miss Fitzroy, was to
be in New-York two days before the ball.
Young Dudley and Mr. Gindrat accompanied
me there. I awaited their arrival with the
most eager impatience, and clasped Margaret
to my heart the moment she alighted from
the carriage. I pass over all the delight of
meeting; all the thousand kind things said
and thought; all the joy and timidity of
young Dudley; and only pause to mention
that in the short space of two days, I three
times surprised Margaret Williams entirely
absorbed in Allan Ramsay's Gentle
Shepherd
,
before I introduce my readers to the
lighted ball-room. When I entered, with
Margaret leaning on my arm, much of the
company had already assembled, and an
audible
buzz of admiration followed her as we
15A
passed along. Chandeliers, flowers, and
groups of beautiful heads, always give to a
ball-room the mellow brilliancy of fairy-land;
but a military ball has charms peculiar to
itself
;
it seems like a fragment of chivalry,
and partakes of the high, poetic interest of
tilts and tournaments. As I looked round
upon the gay scene, I heard a loud whisper
of applause, and soon perceived that it
announced
the entrance of my friend Miss
Fitzroy. Her blazing and radiant beauty
was of a character totally different from my
Margaret's. Her face and figure were the
statuary's embodied dream; her complexion
was dazzlingly fair, and her eyes had an
expression
lucid and tranquil, as Lake George
by summer's moonlight. In the Venus de
Medicis, art studied nature, and in one form
concentrated the graces of a thousand
models
;
but it now seemed as if nature, vexed
at the successful rivalry, had studied every
line of beauty from Praxiteless to Canova,
and thrown over the whole the rich colouring
of Titian. She glided through the room
with a majestic, swan-like motion, so modest
in its pride, that it seemed like a total
unconsciousness
of her charms. While I was
listening to some eloquent badinage upon
having hurried Margaret away from her, I
saw Mr. Gindrat enter. I had seen him
much, and become more and more interested
in him during the brief period I have
mentioned
;
but as I became convinced that
Margaret was his sister, I earnestly wished
that he should meet her in public, and judge
of her as an entire stranger. That she was
Angelina Gindrat I had now no doubt; for
under the pretence of telling her fortune, I
had asked her to show me her arm. The
carrier-dove and his letter were there as plain
as when I first kissed that little arm on board
the Amphitrite; and with deep fervour my
heart thanked the all-wise Being who had
thus enabled me unconsciously to fulfil my
promise to Mrs. Reynolds. With excitement
almost too tumultuous to be happy, I sought
Mr. Gindrat, to introduce him to Margaret.
Who are those beautiful ladies you have
just left? inquired he, after the first
salutation
had passed. It is the celebrated Miss
15B
Fitzroy, from the south, and her friend Miss
Williams, replied I. The one with pearls
in her hair is the famous beauty.
There's a divine proportion!
Eyes fit for Phbus' self to gild the world with;
And there's a brow arch'd like the state of Heaven;
Look, how it bends, and with what radiance,
As if the synod of the Gods sat under;
Look there, and wonder!
She is indeed a beautiful creature,
rejoined
he, but what a queen-like figure
stands beside her! How genius pours forth
in torrents of expression! and how much
graceful vivacity there is in the very bend of
her neck! She is my adopted daughter,
said I, and if you wish, I will introduce
you. But why have I not heard of her
before! asked he, in a tone of surprise.
Oh, we have had weightier matters to talk
of, you know, and rich young men are apt to
suspect fathers, who are too anxious to
introduce
their daughters. Smiling, he followed
me toward the ladies, and I introduced him
as a friend from Europe. Both were
obviously
prepossessed in his favour; and it was
soon whispered among the circle of beaux,
that Miss Fitzroy had never before
condescended
to treat any gentleman with so much
attention. She accepted his invitation to
dance, and they took their places at the
head of the first cotillion. Two reputed
lovers
of Margaret's were making their way
toward her, when she involuntarily gave an
earnest glance toward the place where
Dudley
stood aloof, apparently in no very
cheerful
mood. He met the expressive look, and
was instantly at her side. I heard much
animated conversation whenever the couples
met in the windings of the dance; and when
the ladies were seated near me, Gindrat took
his station at Margaret's side. These
orange and lemon trees, said he, almost
make me imagine myself in my native island;
and there are flowers here to night, added
he, with marked emphasis, so like the
productions
of my sunny clime, that the
recollections
of my childhood come vividly before
me; and he went on describing the beauties
of tropical regions with surprising volubility
and eloquence. Miss Fitzroy listened with
a marked interest, which made some of her
admirers frown; and Margaret gave one of
her most fascinating smiles, as she said, I
have strange thoughts sometimes. As you
describe these scenes, it seems to me like
recalling
a dream long since forgotten. Visions
crowd on my memory, and are gone before
I can trace their outline. I am half tempted
to believe in the transmigration of souls. Who
knows but that, as a happy little bird, I have
floated over the scenes you describe so well?
Gindrat listened with a mingled air of
deference
and admiration; and Dudley gave me
a glance full of prophetic meaning. The
two beauties were soon after engaged in
another
dance. Margaret was Mr. Gindrat's
partner, and I watched their growing interest
in each other, with a heart even more happy
than their own. I had resolved that the
denouement
should take place the next day,
and my imagination was rapidly running over
the scenewhen Margaret chanced to drop
her bracelet. Mr. Gindrat took it up, and
as she stepped aside to clasp it he remarked
the beauty of the workmanship. It was an
exquisitely cut cameo of Psyche, upon a
yellow ground. After looking at it, an
instant
,
May I have the honour? said he,
offering to place it upon her arm. Her lace
sleeve was slightly deranged, and she turned
her arm to adjust it. A half suppressed
ejaculation burst from Gindrat's lips, and
reeling with faintness, he leaned against the
folding doors. I supported him to the air.
Put me into a carriage, said he quickly,
and come with mecome with me. I
saw how it wasthe transparent sleeve had
betrayed the carrier-dove, and all my plans
of a regular catastrophe were frustrated.
* * * * * * *
When I asked my new friend to forgive me
for thus concealing my conjecturesSay
nothing of forgiveness, cried he. To
find her at all, would have been a blessing.
Yes, even in ignorance and obscurity; but
to find her thusso elegantso well
educated
Oh,
may heaven bless you! may heaven
bless you! Money can, and shall reward
her rough country protectors; but youOh,
may heaven bless you!
All the wonder and joy which followed
can be better imagined than expressed.
Crowds of suitors contended with each other
for the bright West-Indian prize. To all,
she gave a kind, but very decided negative;
and all her friends, except Frank Dudley,
divined the cause. The sight of Allan
Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd marked in many
interesting places, and blistered with tears,
did at length enable hope to weigh down the
long fluctuating scale in his distrustful mind.
Mr. Gindrat felt grateful to his sister's
long-tried
friend, the beautiful Miss Fitzroy; and
in his enthusiastic nature, gratitude changed
to love almost as suddenly as the aloe bursts
into blossom when touched by fairy wand.
Both the lovers were made happy by a frank
avowal of reciprocated attachment; and one
bright June day witnessed their splendid
bridals. Mr. Gindrat has sold his
West-India
property, and purchased two beautiful
plantations in Virginia; and Angelina and
Orlando live within sight of each other's
piazzas. I care less about rambling, now
that my heart has such a happy home; but
I have not lost, and I trust I shall never lose,
an active, affectionate interest in my fellow
creatures, though I am an odd old bachelor.
A NEW YEAR'S OFFERING
TO A FRIEND.
A happy New Year, thou lovely one!
As bright as roses bathed in sun
Around thy path may the dancing hours
Scatter wreaths of radiant flowers!
On thy pure cheek health's mantling glow
Flits like a sun-blush o'er the snow;
And the soft shade of thy raven hair
Rests on a brow so passing fair,
I dare not think, majestic maid,
Thy soul-lit beauty e'er can fade.
And may it notI would that thou,
With gentle lip and lofty brow,
And the changing light of thy lucid eye,
Should'st live on earth immortally!
Sure life and love must stay with thee,
Chain'd by thy potent witchery.
Yet would I not the flatt'ring throng
Should lure thee with a syren song
'Twere better far for one pure heart
To love for what thou really art:
Not a painted toy to please awhile,
To feign a blush, and act a smile
But one whose noble, generous soul,
Spurn's affection's mean control;
Who life's most sparkling cup has quaff'd,
Uninjured by the dang'rous draught.
'Tis this that binds me with a spell,
Whose power I find no words to tell.
A happy New Year, thou lovely one!
As bright as roses bathed in sun
Around thy path may the dancing hours
Scatter wreaths of radiant flowers!
NATURE AND SIMPLICITY.
The tree of knowledge is not the tree of life.
Byron
.
No one of gifted mind has passed even
the first freshness of youth, without feeling
that it is not with him as it has been.
Knowledge
and taste may have increased his
intellectual
riches, and association may have
added her powerful spell to half the charms
of nature; but the soul does not rejoice in
these possessions, as it once did in the
simple
wealth of birds and flowers.
The sunshine is a glorious birth;
But yet we know, where'er we go,
That there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth.
We talk very philosophically of the
negative
enjoyments of childhood; and try to
convince ourselves that the light and glory
which memory throws around it, are but the
delusions of imagination. It is not well to
argue thus. There is deep meaning in the
maxim, Reverence little children; and it
would be better for us, both here and
hereafter
,
if we inscribed it on our hearts as a
spell against the festering influence of our
own bad passions. I would not, with sickly
sentimentality, mourn over states of mind
never to be entirely recalled: this idle habit
has too often wasted the strength of intellect,
and been assumed by inferior minds,
incapable
of imitating anything of genius except
its errors.
But if we observe that all the world look
back to the earlier stages of being with fond
regret, ought we not to suppose there is
strong reason for so deep a feeling? If the
thoughts and affections were then veiled in
a robe of sunbeams, should we not ask
whence the light came, and why it now visits
us so transiently?
There is but one answerwe are simple
and artless then. Therefore the influence of
God is around us, and within us, like the
atmosphere we breathe, sustaining life and
giving joy to those who perchance have
never
known there was an atmosphere.
If, then, there is such close sympathy
between simplicity and heaven, let us
earnestly
strive to be as little children. It
is not well to be too wise for happiness; it
is not safe to be too learned for salvation.
Byron was an intellectual Laocoon,
writhing
majestically in the embrace of serpents
himself had wakened into life; but how
much wiser and happier is that meek and
quiet poet, who finds in a simple wild-flower
thoughts too deep for tears.
Every thing that we involuntarily love is
true to nature; and nothing that we
learn
to
love produces fresh and glowing emotions.
What is genius? It is but a fitting
expression
of that which Nature teaches the
soul; and when our hearts thrill in sympathy
with this mysterious power, we wonder that
those simple feelings, which form the very
elements of our common nature, are not
always
as artlessly expressed.
What are gracefulness and majesty? We
find them in the rapid gambols of the
antelope
,
and the stately motion of the eagle;
and we love and admire them because they
speak of happy freedom, careless of
observers
.
Art, with her utmost skill, never touches
the heart, unless she makes herself forgotten
by her close imitation of nature. Why do
we suffer pride, vanity, or ambition, to take
from us a gift, which we exert all our
faculties
to
seem
to possess?
Our religion expressly tells us how to
enter the kingdom of heaven; our own
hearts repeat it with mournful tenderness,
whenever we look on the guilenessness of
infancy; and why do we persist in
disobeying
the lesson?
The haughty soul of man has always
scorned simplicity. He, that was told to
wash in the pool, and be healed, was
indignant
because he was not commanded to
perform
some
great
thing; and thus it ever is
with us self-sufficient mortals. We are
willing
to make extraordinary sacrifices, and act
an arduous part, in order to attain the very
character that would be the natural result of
a simple and sincere course. We destroy
the vitality of nature by engrafting upon her
motives taught by worldly selfishness; and
we are then obliged to counterfeit what we
cannot regain. This is the reason a glory
has departed from the earth; and for this
cause do the welcome indications of its return
come so rarely and so briefly, to gladden the
rich in mind, and innocent of heart. If we
were willing to become as little children,
we should keep our souls open to the holy
influence of God's works, as well as his
word; and then we should not have cause to
mourn over the faded brightness of our youth.
The Dodonian oracle spoke through doves
and trees; and the pure in heart may still
hear a voice in nature proclaiming truth
from heaven.
CHOCORUA'S CURSE.
The
rocky county of Strafford,
New-Hampshire
,
is remarkable for its wild and
broken scenery. Ranges of hills towering
one above another, as if eager to look upon
the beautiful country, which afar off lies
sleeping in the embrace of heaven;
precipices
,
from which the young eagles take their
flight to the sun; dells rugged and tangled as
the dominions of Roderick Vich Alpine, and
ravines dark and deep enough for the death
scene of a bandit, form the magnificent
characteristics
of this picturesque region.
A high precipice, called Chocorua's Cliff,
is rendered peculiarly interesting by a legend
which tradition has scarcely saved from utter
oblivion. Had it been in Scotland, perhaps
the genius of Sir Walter would have
hallowed
it, and Americans would have crowded
there to kindle fancy on the altar of memory.
17
Being in the midst of our own romantic
scenery, it is little known, and less visited;
for the vicinity is as yet untraversed by
railroads
or canals, and no Mountain House,
perched on these tremendous battlements,
allures the traveller hither to mock the
majesty
of nature with the insipidities of fashion.
Our distinguished artist, Mr. Cole, found the
sunshine and the winds sleeping upon it in
solitude and secresy; and his pencil has
brought it before us in its stern repose.
In olden time, when Goffe and Whalley
passed for wizards and mountain spirits
among the superstitious, the vicinity of the
spot we have been describing was occupied
by a very small colony, which, either from
discontent or enterprise, had retired into this
remote part of New-Hampshire. Most of
them were ordinary men, led to this
independent
mode of life from an impatience of
restraint, which as frequently accompanies
vulgar obstinacy as generous pride. But
there was one master spirit among them,
who was capable of a higher destiny than he
ever fulfilled. The consciousness of this had
stamped something of proud humility on the
face of Cornelius Campbell; something of a
haughty spirit, strongly curbed by
circumstances
he could not control, and at which
he scorned to murmur. He assumed no
superiority; but unconsciously he threw
around him the spell of intellect, and his
companions felt, they knew not why, that
he was among them, but not of them.
His stature was gigantic, and he had the
bold, quick tread of one who had wandered
frequently and fearlessly among the terrible
hiding-places of nature. His voice was
harsh, but his whole countenance possessed
singular capabilities for tenderness of
expression
;
and sometimes, under the gentle
influence
of domestic excitement, his hard features
would be rapidly lighted up, seeming like the
sunshine flying over the shaded fields in an
April day.
His companion was one peculiarly
calculated
to excite and retain the deep, strong
energies of manly love. She had possessed
extraordinary beauty; and had, in the full
maturity of an excellent judgment,
relinquished
16A
several splendid alliances, and incurred
her father's displeasure, for the sake of
Cornelius
Campbell. Had political
circumstances
proved favourable, his talents and
ambition
would unquestionably have worked out
a path to emolument and fame; but he had
been a zealous and active enemy of the
Stuarts
,
and the restoration of Charles the
Second was the death-warrant of his hopes.
Immediate flight became necessary, and
America was the chosen place of refuge.
His adherence to Cromwell's party was not
occasioned by religious sympathy, but by
political views, too liberal and philosophical
for the state of the people; therefore
Cornelius
Campbell was no favourite with our
forefathers
,
and being of a proud nature, he
withdrew with his family to the solitary place
we have mentioned.
It seemed a hard fate for one who had
from childhood been accustomed to
indulgence
and admiration, yet Mrs. Campbell
enjoyed more than she had done in her days
of splendour; so much deeper are the sources
of happiness than those of gaiety. Even her
face had suffered little from time and
hardship
.
The bloom on her cheek, which in
youth had been like the sweet-pea blossom,
that most feminine of all flowers, had, it is
true, somewhat faded; but her rich,
intellectual
expression, did but receive additional
majesty from years; and the exercise of quiet
domestic love, which, where it is suffered to
exist, always deepens and brightens with
time, had given a bland and placid expression,
which might well have atoned for the absence
of more striking beauty. To such a woman
as Caroline Campbell, of what use would
have been some modern doctrines of equality
and independence?
With a mind sufficiently cultivated to
appreciate
and enjoy her husband's intellectual
energies, she had a heart that could not have
found another home. The bird will drop
into its nest though the treasures of earth
and sky are open. To have proved marriage
a tyranny, and the cares of domestic life a
thraldom, would have affected Caroline
Campbell as little, as to be told that the
pure, sweet atmosphere she breathed, was
17B
pressing upon her so many pounds to every
square inch! Over such a heart, and such
a soul, external circumstances have little
power; all worldly interest was concentrated
in her husband and babes, and her spirit was
satisfied with that inexhaustible fountain of
joy which nature gives, and God has blessed.
A very small settlement, in such a remote
place, was of course subject to inconvenience
and occasional suffering. From the Indians
they received neither injury nor insult. No
cause of quarrel had ever arisen; and,
although
their frequent visits were sometimes
troublesome, they never had given
indications
of jealousy or malice. Chocorua was
a prophet among them, and as such an
object
of peculiar respect. He had a mind
which education and motive would have
nerved with giant strength; but growing up
in savage freedom, it wasted itself in dark,
fierce, ungovernable passions. There was
something fearful in the quiet haughtiness of
his lipit seemed so like slumbering power,
too proud to be lightly roused, and too
implacable
to sleep again. In his small, black,
fiery eye, expression lay coiled up like a
beautiful snake. The white people knew
that his hatred would be terrible; but they
had never provoked it, and even the children
became too much accustomed to him to fear
him.
Chocorua had a son, about nine or ten
years old, to whom Caroline Campbell had
occasionally made such gaudy presents as
were likely to attract his savage fancy. This
won the child's affections, so that he became
a familiar visitant, almost an inmate of their
dwelling; and being unrestrained by the
courtesies of civilized life, he would inspect
everything, and taste of everything which
came in his way. Some poison, prepared
for a mischievous fox, which had long
troubled
the little settlement, was discovered and
drunk by the Indian boy; and he went home
to his father to sicken and die. From that
moment jealousy and hatred took possession
of Chocorua's soul. He never told his
suspicions
he
brooded over them in secret, to
nourish the deadly revenge he contemplated
against Cornelius Campbell.
The story of Indian animosity is always
the same. Cornelius Campbell left his hut
for the fields early one bright, balmy morning
in June. Still a lover, though ten years a
husband, his last look was turned towards his
wife, answering her parting smilehis last
action a kiss for each of his children. When
he returned to dinner, they were deadall
dead! and their disfigured bodies too cruelly
showed that an Indian's hand had done the
work!
In such a mind grief, like all other
emotions
,
was tempestuous. Home had been to
him the only verdant spot in the wide desert
of life. In his wife and children he had
garnered
up all his heart; and now they were
torn from him, the remembrance of their love
clung to him like the death-grapple of a
drowning man, sinking him down, down,
into
darkness and death. This was followed
by a calm a thousand times more terrible
the creeping agony of despair, that brings
with it no power of resistance.
It was as if the dead could feel
The icy worm around him steal.
Such, for many days, was the state of
Cornelius Campbell. Those who knew and
reverenced him, feared that the spark of
reason was forever extinguished. But it
rekindled
again, and with it came a wild,
demoniac
spirit of revenge. The death-groan
of Chocorua would make him smile in his
dreams; and when he waked, death seemed
too pitiful a vengeance for the anguish that
was eating into his very soul.
Chocorua's brethern were absent on a
hunting expedition at the time he committed
the murder; and those who watched his
movements observed that he frequently
climbed the high precipice, which afterward
took his name, probably looking out for
indications
of their return.
Here Cornelius Campbell resolved to
effect
his deadly purpose. A party was
formed
under his guidance, to cut off all chance
of retreat, and the dark-minded prophet was
to be hunted like a wild beast to his lair.
The morning sun had scarce cleared away
the fogs when Chocorua started at a loud
voice from beneath the precipice,
commanding
him to throw himself into the deep abyss
below. He knew the voice of his enemy,
and replied with an Indian's calmness,
The Great Spirit gave life to Chocorua;
and Chocorua will not throw it away at the
command of a white man. Then hear
the Great Spirit speak in the white man's
thunder! exclaimed Cornelius Campbell,
as he pointed his gun to the precipice.
Chocorua
,
though fierce and fearless as a panther,
had never overcome his dread of fire-arms.
He placed his hand upon his ears to shut out
the stunning report; the next moment the
blood bubbled from his neck, and he reeled
fearfully on the edge of the precipice. But
he recovered himself, and, raising himself on
his hands, he spoke in a loud voice, that
grew more terrific as its huskiness increased,
A curse upon ye, white men! May the
Great Spirit curse ye when he speaks in the
clouds, and his words are fire! Chocorua
had a sonand ye killed him while his eye
still loved to look on the bright sun, and the
green earth! The Evil Spirit breathe death
upon your cattle! Your graves lie in the war
path of the Indian! Panthers howl, and
wolves fatten over your bones! Chocorua
goes to the Great Spirithis curse stays with
the white men!
The prophet sunk upon the ground, still
uttering inaudible cursesand they left his
bones to whiten in the sun. But his curse
rested on the settlement. The tomahawk
and scalping knife were busy among them,
the winds tore up trees and hurled them at
their dwellings, their crops were blasted,
their cattle died, and sickness came upon
their strongest men. At last the remnant of
them departed from the fatal spot to mingle
with more populous and prosperous colonies.
Cornelius Campbell became a hermit, seldom
seeking or seeing his fellow men; and two
years after he was found dead in his hut.
To this day the town of Burton, in
New-Hampshire
,
is remarkable for a pestilence
which infects its cattle; and the superstitious
think that Chocorua's spirit still sits enthroned
upon his precipice, breathing a curse upon
them.
TO A HUSBAND,
Who presented, as a New-Year's Offering, a Heart and a Laurel
wreath, the leaves of which were not very abundant.
I
care
not for the wreath of laurel
It never soothed my brow
Its
scanty
leaves convey a moral,
I've learned full well ere now.
And could fame's fairest amplest dower
Descend to one like me,
I'd not exchange a transient hour
Of sunny smiles from thee!
Then take the wreathI love the heart
For 'tis a type of thine
From such a gift I cannot part,
While there is life in mine.
But keep the wreathI prize it not,
While I am loved by thee;
And should my image be forgot,
Oh! what were crowns to me?
THE FIRST AND LAST BOOK.
One
remembers writing his first book as
distinctly as he recollects the first time he
saw the ocean. Like the unquiet sea, all
the elements of our nature are then heaving
and tumultuous. Restless, insatiable
ambition
,
is on us like a fiery charm. Every thing
partakes of the brightness and boundlessness
of our own hopes. Nature is encircled with
a perpetual glory; and the seasons, as they
pass on, scatter pearls and diamonds for our
abundant fancy. It then seems strange how
mortals can
avoid
being intellectually great;
for irresistible inspiration appears to stream
in upon the human mind, like the light and
heat of the sun. Creation is an open volume
of poetry and truth, and it seems as if
whoever
glanced upon it must read what angels
have written there.
We then feel interested in all the world,
and think all the world must feel interested
in us: yet it is not vanityit is simply the
expansive power of a youthful ambitious
mind, measuring its strength by its hopes.
We then write because we cannot help it
the mind is a full fountain that
will
overflow
and if the waters sparkle as they fall, it is
from their own impetuous abundance.
Such are the feelings with which we write
at first. Afterward, the cares of the world
press heavily on the spirit. The smiles of
the public no longer have power to kindle
us into enthusiastic energy; and its frowns
fall like a shadow on the rock. We learn
that ambition is not always powerthat the
eager eye may be fastened on the sun, but
the weary wing can never reach it.
The goal, which once appeared bright in
the distance, is despised because another still
brighter lies beyond itand when we know
how unsatisfactory that too would prove, if
gained, how can it be pursued with eagerness?
Whoever seeks for fame rolls the stone of
Sisyphus. When we have grown old at the
task, the sight of young ambition sometimes
makes us smile in sad mockery of its hopes;
and we feel that imagination has no bitterer
curse to bestow upon an enemy.
But thoughts like these are merely the
occasional
struggles of the giant beneath the
mountain he cannot heave from him. In
general, the love of quiet rests on the mind
like a drowsy spell; and we are well content
to have for our epitaph that we have lived,
and have died. Alas, that the proud and
weary spirit cannot always rest! The opal,
pale, and cold, and cloudy, as it seems, has a
spark of fire forever imprisoned in its bosom.
The last book, like the first, may indeed
be written because we cannot help it: not that
the full mind overflowsbut the printer's
boy stands at our elbow. We then look to
bookseller's accounts for inspiration, hunt for
pearls because we have promised to furnish
them, and string glass beads because they
will sell better than diamonds.
Such is the difference between the first and
last of all things the world can give us. We
start fresh and vigorous, as if life were a
revelry
the
game proves to be a battle, hardly
worth the winningand we pause mid-way
tired and disheartened, content to dream
ourselves
into the realities of death.
But there are gifts, over which the world
has no power. Religious hope, and deep
domestic love, can meet no change, except
the transfer from a happy earth to a happier
heaven. The heart,blessed be God! the
heart never grows old.
