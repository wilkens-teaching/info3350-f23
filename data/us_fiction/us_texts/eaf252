BEL
OF
PRAIRIE EDEN.
CHAPTER I.
`
They
are strangely superstitious, these wild
men of the prairie, who, with rifle in hand,
and the deep starlight of the illimitable
heavens above, wander in silence over the
trackless yet blooming wilderness. Left
to their own thoughts, they seem to see
spectral forms, rising from the shadows,
and hear voices from the other world, in
every unusual sound. Among their
superstitions
there is one which has often struck
me with its singular interest and beauty'
MSS. of a Texan
.
`Come brother, it is a beautiful viewlook
yonder.'
The boy advanced from the shadow of the
oak and gazed upon the prairie, bathed in the
light of the setting sun. He was but a boy,
slender and girlish in form, and yet he
grasped
a rifle in his hand and carried a knife in
his belt.
His brother did not seem to heed him, but
stood leaning against the trunk of the oak, his
arms folded over his rifle, while his downcast
eyes were fixed upon the sod. The sun in
its last glow cast a warm light over his broad
chest and muscular form, and invested with a
golden flush, his fine aquiline features, shaded
by a dark beard and flowing black hair. It
was altogether a striking face; the eyes,
somewhat sunken beneath the well-defined
brows, were large, black, and strangely
brilliant
.
He would have been observed and
gazed at in any company, and even now, as
he stood beside the oak, the boundless prairie
around, and the Great God above, there was
something noble in his look and bearing. It is
true he wore a plaid grey frock, reaching to
the knee and edged with fur, yet this
unpretending
garment displayed a broad chest,
supported
by a waist, at once slender and pliable,
and revealed the iron outline of his sinewy
arms. Its color, pale grey, gave a richer
lustre to the sunset glow which bathed his
face.
On the sod before him lay his hat, a rude
thing of grey felt, with skull-crown and wide
slouching brim. It was decorated with a
single black feather.
`Come, brother John; look! is it not a
beautiful view? Our men, the volunteers of
Prairie Eden, encamped on the prairie; near
this knoll, their horses grazing on the rich
grass, as gathered in a circle, their rifles near
them, they build the camp-fire and prepare
for their evening meal. Look at the sky,
Johnnot one cloud! Yes, one; a little
cloud, hovering like a bird, in the west, just
over the setting sun, and turning, blue,
purple
and gold, as the light grows brighter ere
it fades. The prairie, John,the grass
moving
like waves at sea, with all kinds of
beautiful
flowers, starting from the sod. Come,
don't stand muttering there; come I say.'
And the slender boy laid his hand upon his
brother's arm, and playfully sought to raise
his head.
The brother, still absorbed in his thoughts
did not heed him.
`Here we are, thirty miles from San
Antonio
.
Shall we go forward?shall we
return
home?'
`Home!pshaw! Did not we leave
Prairie
Eden this morningwe'
`
We!
' echoed the older brother, raising
his eyes and surveying the girlish form before
him.
`Yes,
we!
the Voluntears of Prairie Eden
composed of Mr. Jacob Grywin's two sons,
forty white laborerssome civilized people
from the States, others German emigrants
and ten black slaves; not to mention Ewen
McGregor, who now comes up the knoll to
speak with
Captain
John Grywin.'
John raised his eyes, surveyed for a
moment
the smoke of the camp fire in the
prairie
,
not one hundred yards from where he
stood, and then his gaze rested upon the new
comer.
You will observe that the knoll on which
the brothers stood was one of those delicious
green islands which dot the rolling surface of
the wild Texan prairie, and are seen by the
wayfarer sometimes at the distance of thirty
miles. It was crowned by a solitary tree, a
greak oak, whose trunk three men could not
have spanned with their extended arms.
Broad and wide above the brothers' head,
stretched out the rugged branches, clad in a
glorious drapery of silvery moss, which
floated
like a shining shroud, among the deep
green leaves.
`Captain John, while the boys take their
supper, I've come up here to have a little
talk with you.'
It was a harsh, grating voice. The figure
was that of a giant, so towering in stature, so
massive in the bull-like chest, and formidable
long arms, whose corded sinews were
impressed
upon the folds of the grey sleeves.
The face was like the form, huge and burly.
A red visage, with white eyebrows and
eyelashes
,
short stiff red hair and an immense
red beard, matted like the mane of some wild
animal. It was not the most prepossessing
form in the world, nor the prettiest face, yet
an air of bluff, hearty frankness, seemed to
pervade each featureeven the mouth, with
thick lips and the large eyes with yellowish
ballsand govern the movement of every
limb, as Ewen McGregor drew near the
oak.
`Well, Ewen, or rather, Lieutenant
McGregor
'
said John.
`You see, when we left Prairie Eden this
morning, bound for San Antonio, in obedience
to a proclamation of the President of Texas,
which summoned `all good citizens' to the
western frontier, menaced as it is by a fresh
Mexican invasionwhen we left, I say, there
was some things which we
did
know, and
some things which we
ought
to know, but
did
not
know, by !'
`Well Ewen?' said John, calmly
surveying
the bluff form hefore him, while Harry
looked on with a sort of comical wonder
dilating
his clear blue eyes.
`We are going to San Antonio,' resumed
Ewen, resting his rifle on the sod. `For
days there has been a rumor of the approach
of the Mexican general who commands at
Presidio del Rio Grande. How do we know
that at this very moment this General, Don
Bascus, is not in possession of San
Antonio
?'
`If we dont know we can easily ascertain.
A ride of thirty miles after dark will bring
us to San Antonio before midnight.'
This cool respone seemed to disconcert the
bluff Ewen.
`But, Capt. John, suppose the town should
be occupied by some thousand Mexican
devils'
`That would make us equal. Fifty white
men of Texas are equivalent to one thousand
Mexicans, any day. That computation is in
some degree unfair, for it gives one Texan and
his good rifle for twenty Mexicans. You see
Ewen, General Bascus and his thousand men
must not stand in the way of fifty volunteers
from Prairie Eden.'
`Not mentioning the ten niggers,' laughed
Harry, as he mischievously pulled Red Ewen
by the heard. `We'll fling the darkies in,
and not make any charge for them.'
Was it a flush of anger that crossed Ewen's
face? He was silent for a moment, and then
in a voice and with a manner which indicated
a man of some education, he resumed
`Let us dismiss all jesting on the subject,
John. General Bascus, whose approach is
indicated by a rumor that grows more like
truth every hour, has not merely a thousand
men, but ten thousand incarnate devils with
him. Suppose you go on to San Antonio to
night and fall into his clutches? Just think
of it, Johnyou and your brother, and all
your laborors and slaves, dragged away to rot
in a Mexican prison, while your
father
and
Isabel
await your return at Prairie Eden.'
This picture touched John with great force.
Harry's smile died away and tears filled his
blue eyes.
`O, John! Ewen speaks the truth! What
would become of father and Isabel, in case
we were taken prisoners?'
`Yes, I see it now; I was wrong this
morning
to leave them so utterly unprotected at
Prairie Eden. To be sure, our home is
isolated
;
their is not much danger from the
Indians
,
and as for the neighbors, the nearest
is ten miles from Prairie Eden. But what
would you propose?'
`Remain encamped here to-night. It will
be time enough for us to go on our way
to-morrow
morning. And in the meantime
but look to the East; do you see that knoll,
distant some ten miles?'
They followed the direction of his brawny
hand, and saw the knoll, rising dim and
vague among the mists, which began to
whiten the eastern prairie.
`I know Ben Davis, the scout, who has
pitched his cabin there. If any one can give
us any news of the Mexicans, he's the man to
do it. By your leave, I will take my horse
ride over there, and have a talk with him. I
can be back long afore midnight.'
`John's face manifested some thought. `It
seems about the best course.'
`Oh let him gothink of FatherIsabel!'
cried Harry, sezing his brother by both his
hands.'
Ewen smiled at Harry's earnestness, and
smiled until his thick lips parted, and his
decayed
,
irregular teeth were visible.
`Well, Ewen, you'd better go; and mind
ye, let your return be as speedy as
possible
.'
`Trust me for
that!
'
And Red Ewen turned away, without a
moments delay, and descended the knoll,
bending his steps towards the encampment.
They saw his broad knife glistening in the
sun, as he crushed the grass with his long,
heavy strides.
`Do you remember Ewen in Philadel
Harry began, as he surveyed the peaceful
group of the encampment of rugged hunters
encircling the fires which sent their volumes
of pale blue smoke into the sky.
`Hush!' and John's brow grew dark; his
eye flashed with sudden intensity; `we never
mention that name in the prairie.'
`There he goes, the Giant with Red Head
and Thick Lips! Look how he rides!'
Wishing to drive his brother's thoughts
from a painful topic, he stretched forth his
small white hand and pointed towards Ewen,
who was seen dashing towards the east,
mounted on one of those fiery horses,
peculiar
to the prairie, with eyes like coals, and
long, black, matted mane.
John stood buried in thought. The twilight
was gathering over the prairie, and in the
broad west glowed the last flush of the
departed
sun. A fresh breeze arose and came
tossing the grass like waves, as it gathered
perfume from the innumerable flowers.
Henry gazed with some awe in the face of
his older brother, and saw his brow grow
darker, his eye more wild and absent in its
glance.
`Its always the way with him when I
mention
that name,' he said and turned away to
the western edge of the knoll.
It
was a very beautiful thing to see the
last flush of the day imparting its soft golden
warmth to that boyish face, whose white brow
and clear blue eyes seemed animated with a
deep, tranquil delight.
The boy was gazing to the west, far, far
over the boundless view, as the night seemed
hovering above the prairie, pausing for a
moment
ere it came down to kiss its flowers and
sleep upon its breast.
Far in the north-west, the level line of the
horizon was broken by an almost
imperceptible
elevation which shone like a golden point,
from the shadows which sheltered around and
beneath. Henry gazed upon that elevation,
earnestly and long, until his breath came in
gasps, his blue eye acquired a light, well-nigh
as intense as his brother's.
`That must be
Prairie Eden
,' he said, as
sinking on the sod, he crossed his hands upon
his knees, and thought, while the night came
down, of home, of Father and Isabel.
The night came slowly in its starlight
drapery
,
and still the boy Harry sat in silence on
the edge of the Prairie knoll, his slender form
couched artlessly on the tall thick grass, while
his eyes were raised to the heavens, and an
indefinable emotion stole over his face.
Believe
me, it was a face to love, so much of
woman in its every outline, and yet a
firmness
like that of tried manhood, manifested
in the sudden flash of the blue eyes, the quick
nervous compression of the warm lips.
And the breeze tossed his soft brown hair,
and floated it in glossy masses over his
forehead
,
but could not hide the tears that came
imperceptibly into his eyes, and made them
shine the brighter in the deep starlight.
`I know what they are now doing now at
Prairie Eden. I can see the wide hall
lighted
up, and father sitting near the table with
the Bible on his knee. Sister is near him,
bending over his shoulder as he reads. Yes,
yes; I can see her black ringlets touching his
grey hair, and floating upon his fore head. It
is a happy home, and'
His fancy dared not look upon the picture
of the future, for a vision of war and battles
rose up before him, and while his young blood
danced with the raptures of a soldier's life, he
seemed to hear a voice which said,`
And
that home you will never reach again!
'
Long he sat there, absorbed in his own
thoughts, while from the other side of the
knool, the songs and merry voices of the
encamped
volunteers of Prairie Eden, broke
unheeded
on his ear. At last his waking thoughts
melted in a dream, and sinking on the sod,
with the rifle in his hand, he slept the sound
sleep of boyhoodthat sleep worth all the
gold and power in the world, for angels watch
over it, and fan the sleeper's cheek with their
invisible wings.
He unclosed his eyes at last, and started up
half-dreaming and but half awake. The
morn was rising over the prairie. Far in the
east a globe of pale gold was seen on the verge
of the horizon, gleaming a sad and solemn
light, as it was about to launch away into the
great ocean of the sky.
As Harry started to his feet a dark object
interposed between his sight and the moon.
He passed his hand over his forehead, and
with the peculiar nervous fear of one
suddenly
aroused from a sound slumber, uttered an
ejaculation that broke with startling emphasis
on the dead silence of the prairie.
For all was dead and still. The camp fires
had gone out, the song of the hunters died
away. Not a voice nor soundno vision
but the great prairie stretching forth in the
light of the rising morn, with that unknown
object towering black and dark before him.
`Who comes there?' He stood with the
rifle in his grasp, his finger on the trigger.
A voice answered himcould it be his
brother's
,
so changed and hollow?`Harry it is
I!'. It scarcely rose above a whisper
`Hush!not a word. Our horses are ready
at the foot of the knollcome!'
Wondering whether he was awake or
dreaming, he suffered that extended arm to
lead him silently down the knoll. He saw his
own horse and his brother's standing there,
the saddles on the horses, the reins flung over
their necks, and for the first time recognized
his brother in the dusky figure.
`Mount!' And his brother's face was
turned
to the moon; Harry saw with indefinable
fear, that the features were changed, his eyes
unnaturally vivid and glaring, the broad
forehead
marked with swollen veins.
`Brother' he faltered out as he placed
his feet in the stirrups.
`Not a word! Turn your horse towards
Prairie Eden, and ride as though a thousand
deaths were dogging at his heels. Do not
spare the spur,follow me!'
John's horse plunged beneath the
merciless
iron, and dashed through the grass, as
though possessed by a devil.
Henry saw his brother's form, rising boldly
in the moonlight, and urged his own horse
forward at the top of his speed.
`But, the volunteers, brother,' he cried, as
he gasped for breath.
`Ride, I say! That star in the north-west
you see it? Don't take your eyes from it.
On, in the name of God! That star shines
above Prairie Eden.'
Away they dashed without a word, their
horses maddened by the sharp steel points,
bounding over the sod with an accelerating
speed that seemed rather like the flight of a
bird than the pace of an animal.
Not a word passed between the brothers,
for Harry, panting for breath and racked by
the plunging gait of his horse, looked on the
form of John wiih an unknown feeling,
something
between wonder and awe.
Once or twice a word trembled on his lips
but still his brother, without turning his
head, muttered between his teeth,
`Ride!spur! It is thirty miles to Prairie
Edenwe must reach it in two hours or we
are accursed for ever!'
There was something terrible in the sight!
these black horses, with snorting nostrils
and starting eyeballs, plunging over the
prairie
,
while their riders dug the spurs into their
flanks until the blood spouted forth and
mingled
with the white foam.
The moon shone over them as they dashed
away, and flung their shadows far and black
upon the waving grass. John never once
turned his head, but kept his eye fixed on the
star
. Harry could not keep his gaze from
his brother's changed and ghastly face,it
held him like a spell.
At lastit was when the moon was high
above the horizon, and an hour and a half had
passed awayHarry's horse stumbled and
fell, the blood pouring in torrents from his
nostrils.
Severely bruised and half-stunned, Harry
struggled from beneath the flanks of his dying
horse, and saw John reining his steed back
on his haunches.
`Your horse is dyingcome! Give me
your hand! Spring up before menow then!
Yonder is the Island knoll of Prairie Eden
only five miles distant.'
Harry felt his brother's strong arm around
his chest, and saw his eyesalmost touching
his cheekflash with the same unnatural fire
he felt that his brother was mad, and grew
cold as ice, although the breath that
fanned
his cheek was like the air of a
furnace
.
`Only four milesdo you see the knoll,
Harry? The house among the trees
ah!'
Down came the horse upon his kneeshe
made an effort to rise, trembling in every
nerveit was in vain, With that desperate
effort he rolled upon the sod, the brothers
half bruised beneath his quivering flanks. It
was scarcely an instant before John had
gained
his feet and rescued his brother from his
perilous situation.
`Harryare you hurt? Have you strength
left to run those four miles? Take your rifle
and come,'
He clutched his brother in an iron grasp,
add hurried him away, rather dragging him
along than running by his side.
`It may have been a dream,' he muttered;
`but no, no!I saw
him!
With my eyes
before me!'
`Saw
him?
' Harry gasped, as all the
blood in his body seemed rushing to his
eyes.
`Yes; I saw
him
no visionreality, my
brother, horrible reality! My God! the moon
fades, the day is breaking. We've at least
four miles to go. Do not fall, Harry, do not
fainta firm heart, my boy, and God will
bless us! You know I am not superstitious,
but to-night, as I stood beside the oak, while
you lay sleeping near me, I saw
him
, with
his white beard and spectral eyes, andhe
was dressed like an old hunter, Harry,you
have heard the old prairie hunters tell of him,
how he walks the prairie at dead of night,
and starts suddenly upon you, from the earth,
at your horse's side, or even from the sod,
where you lay sleeping. He wakes you with
an ice-cold handso the hunters tell the
story. But you know they are superstitious.
I believe in nothing of the kindIbut
to-night
,
I saw him at my side! Look, Harry,
the sun is rising, and we're three miles from
the Knoll!'
Thus gasping these incoherent words, as
he dragged his awe-stricken and fainting
brother
along, John kept his eyes upon the knoll
and his face grew even yet more pale, his
eyes more frenzied, as the first ray of the
rising sun shot like a golden thread, across
their path.
`Saw whom? Speak, John! Your face
frightens meI believe I'm dying' he
sank on one knee.
`Harry, my dear boymy child!Oh do
not faint now! in a little while and we are
there! You are strong, Harry, it is but fancy
come, I will carry you! But I saw him to
night, and talked with him,
The Old Man of
the Prairie!
that spectre of these horrible
solitudes, who comes to the dwellers in the
wilderness, and tells them of coming evil
nothing but evil. He told melook, Harry,
the sun is shining on the knoll!'
Ere we record the full history of the event
ful nightit was in the spring-time of 1842,
that these incidents occurred,let us, in
order
to understand the history in all its details,
gaze on a scene which occurred some ten
years before.
CHAPTER II.
PRAIRIE EDEN.
`A home in the wilderness for the wanderers
and outcasts of civilization.
Texan MSS
.
A LONE Indian stood on the summit of the
mound.
It was in the centre of one of those prairies
which, in their boundless view, their vast
horizon, remind us of the ocean, only for
waves of foam, we behold emerald grass,
tossing with gentle undulations, their summits
crested by the roses of the wild rising into
view, like sea foam, tinted by the last glow of
a setting sun.
These prairies, like the ocean, have their
islandsgreen mounds, that rise above the
boundless level, blossoming on their banks,
with flowers and vines; crowned on the
summit
with aged trees, that stand in circular
groups, like the solemn mourners over the
dead centuries.
A lone Indian, leaning on his rifle, his
muscular
form, attired in a panther's hide, which
left his sinewy arms and broad chest, bare to
the light, stood on the summit of a green
island, in the centre of that boundless prairie.
His head was drooped, his dark eye, fixed
by strange emotions, glared with an
immoveable
gaze over the glorious view.
Around the prairie that rolled away, far
into the distance, until it became lost in the
hazy line of the horizon, above the blue sky
of a summer's day, dimpled only by a group
of snowy clouds, that seemed to undulate in
mid-air, the clear azure gleaming distinctly
through their feathery folds, even as a virgin's
bosom looks more beautiful through a veil of
lace; by his side, a massive oak, the broad
green leaves almost touching the tuft on his
shaven brow- Alone that Indian stood, his
body turned to the west, while, with his face
over his shoulder, he gazed long and sadly
upon the eastern land.
It was a sad gaze, eloquent as a smile
upon the lips of a dying man, whose veins are
racked by superhuman torture.
The trees of the Island Grove were all
around him. Giant oaks, not more than
twenty in number, circled on a space some
three hundred yards square. Their trunks
were like the huge pillars of some temple,
reared in the wilderness to God; massive as
blocks of granite, and encrusted with the
thick bark, that had been hardening for
centuries
.
Three hundred years had written
their dusky memories upon that rugged rind
of the ancient oaken trees. White moss
clothed their far-spreading branches, and
graceful vine blossoms trembled among their
leaves of luxuriant green.
A hundred men might have encamped with
ease beneath each grand old oak, and found
shelter from the sun and rain, in the shadow,
the silence, the fragrant air of the green island
of the boundless prairie.
The sod, smooth as a floor, and covered
with dark green moss, was sprinkled with
flowers, whose unnumbered shapes of
graceful
beauty and dyes of rainbow loveliness,
neither pencil nor pen can ever paint. Upon
the foliage quivered the drops of last night's
shower.
And in the centre of the island, a spring of
clear, cold water bubbled into light, between
two huge rocks, and without a visible outlet,
kept murmuring and sparkling forever,
always
clear, cold and pure.
The Indian gazed to the west, and the
silent
eloquence of his deep eye found vent in
his rude Indian tongue.
`My fathers dwelt here, when these giant
trees were saplings, not higher than my rifle,
Where are they now? Before this knoll
itself
was reared, as the grave of warriors, Red
Men were upon this soil, the Kings, the
Prophets
of their people. Where are they now?
The bones of the mighty men rest in the
bosom
of this knollbut their children, where
are they? Look for them far away by the
great Salt Lake, in the land of the setting
sun!'
Once more the Indian turned his eye to the
east, as though in the dim line of the horizon
he already discerned the banners and
bayonets
of White civilization, and then turning
sadly away, he sat him down by the waters of
the island spring.
`Water, that comes from the caverns where
my fathers sleep, I drink from your fountain,
once more, and drink for the last time, ere I
depart forever!'
Bathing his hands and brow in the pure
element of the Island fountain, he went on
his way toward the west and came back no
more.
Years passed on, and that prairie of the
wilderness was left to solitude and God. In
the tall grass the deer, with branching horns
and mild eyes, moved over the flowers, the
roses, the dahlias and the lilies of the desert,
without a fear. Along the summit of the
island
came herds of wild cattle, drinking one
by one at the pure springgazing for a
moment
at the boundless yiew, and then dashing
away through the sea of undulating grass, like
a cloud hurled by a thunder storm. Some
times the wolf, gaunt and lean, and
treacherous
as a hypocrite, stole over the sod of the
island grove, and the caguar, with its flashing
eye and sleek fur, dipped his blood-streaked
jaws, in the clear wave of the island
fountain
.
But man came nevermore along the
prairie
.
The Indiansearch for him toward the
west, in the land of the setting sun. The
White Manyonder, in the region of the
rising sun he dwells, his footsteps have
never pressed this virgin soil.
Ten years passed, and a strange sight was
seen one summer morning upon the summit of
the island grove.
A large mansion, reared in the space
between
those circling trees, and built of
massive
logs, disclosed its lofty hall door, its
many windows, and its steep roof, varied by
numerous chimnies, to the beams of the
rising
sun.
The huge trees stretched forth their boughs
above its roof, and the vines trailed in festoons
about its windows. Its black timbers looked
out from the graceful drapery of the white
moss, hanging like a silvery shroud from
branch to branch and from tree to tree.
Altogether, this huge mansion looked like
a baronial fabric of the Middle Ages, invested
as it was with the tokens of a barbarous
luxury
,
something between savage grandeur and
refined civilization. It was two stories in
height, with four spacious rooms on a floor.
These rooms were divided on the first floor,
by a spacious hall; on the second by a
corridor
.
Instead of paint or plaster, the walls of log
were concealed by hangings of various hues
and devices, some of dark green Cordovan
leather, edged with gold, some of the richest
silk. The chairs, the tables, the fire places,
and the stairway, were all on the same scale
of antique grandeur, mingling luxury and
rudeness in every detail.
From the centre of their island grove, this
spacious mansion rose, with the green sod all
around it, the trees half closing it from the sun
and rain, the cool fountain bubbling near it,
some few paces to the west.
Yonder, north of the grove, you behold
fields of emerald corn, with small huts, built
of logs, rising from the quivering leaves. On
the prairie graze herds of sleek cattle, iheir
dappled sides contrasting with the rich grass
around, the quivering beds of wild flowers
beneath
.
And at the morning time, a column
of blue smoke rises over the tops of the trees,
and glows, like the white breast of a bird
turned to the rising sun. It is incense from
the fireside of the Prairie Home.
Who is it that dwells within the prairie
home?
A father and his three children.
That father, a man of slender form, grey
hairs, and sad aspect. He was known by the
name of Jacob Grywin. The nearest
neighbort
who
lived only ten miles from the island
grovelooked with wonder, mingled with
some awe, upon the sad, stern man, who had
so suddenly erected his home in the
wilderness
.
He cameno one knew whither. In the
year 1840, after the young Texas had
struggled
into Independence, through the bloody
clouds of Soliad, the Alamo and San
Jancentho
,
the emigrant first appeared on the
prairie
,
and with his family of three children, his
retainerssome fifty in number, and mostly
from the `States'some dozen German
colonisis
,
and as many slaves, reared the
mansion
,
known by the appropriate name
Prairie
Eden
.
Two years had passed, and the unknown
emigrant, living in a kind of barbarous
splendour
,
beheld his children rising round him,
like fruit and flowers, nursed into vigorous
bloom by the air of the wilderness.
His sons presented a strong contrast. John,
aged twenty-one, was a man of stalwart, yet
graceful propoetions, with a dark brown
visage
,
strongly marked with aquiline features,
and shadowed by dark hair and beard. He
was a magnificent horseman and a fearless
hunter. As he mounted his dark bay horse,
with his riffe, `Old King Death,' as he
quaintly
called it, slung over his shoulder, his long
hair floating in the wind, and his eagle-like
features, marked boldly out against the sky,
he looked for all the world, like a true knight
of the chivalric age.
Harry, his brother, a mere boy of sixteen,
with girlish form, and beardless face, along
whose smooth outline flowed his curling brown
hair, compared with John, reminded you of
the quivering sapling beside the hardy oak.
And yet there was a volume of daring in the
glance of his dark blue eye. John loved him,
as though he was at once father, brother and
friend to girlish Harry,even as David loved
Jonathan, with a love passing the love of
women
.
The third child, three years younger than
John, and of course, one year older than
Harry. I see her now, standing upon the
porch of the mansion, her dark hair, plainly
turned aside, from the warm beauty of her
face, while her round arms, full bust, and
passionate eyes, attest an impetuous, nay a
voluptuous woman.
She was indeed one of the women, whom
we call `queenly,' especially in case our
knowledge of queens is limited. Her stature
was commanding. Her complexion, a clear,
deep olive, burning with red bloom on each
cheek. Her lips, full and warm, and tinted
with dewy vermillion. Her forehead, white
and high, with the jet-black hair, shadowing
its outlines.
These words may give you some idea of
'Bel Grywin, but no words can describe how
suddenly her face changed its expression,
now glooming like a thunder storm, the eyes
armed with lightning and the brow gathering
blackness; and in a moment, soft and
yielding
and tender, as the face of a slumbering
child.
When the eye of the father rested upon the
faces of his children, the cloud passed from
his brow. But when he was alone, either
striding along the porch of his mansion, in
gazing silently over the great prairie, or
passing
,
with cat-like step, from room to room,
there was a gloom upon his features, which,
to say the least, was not pleasant to behold.
That sidelong glance toward the window,
or the door, that involuntary start at the sound
of a footstep, what did they mean?
What need Jacob Grywin fear? Centered
in the midst of this prairie, afar from
civilization
,
and yet surrounded by all its comforts
nay, its luxuries; his children blooming round
him, and his slaves and laborers ready to do
his will, what had he to fear?
There came a day in the spring of 1842,
when the Proclamation of the Texan
President
summoned all good citizens to the
western
frontier, in order to defend the soil of the
young state from a threatened invasion.
Mexico was, of course, known to be the
invader
,
and the impulse of the invasion, Santa
Anna.
Vague rumors floated over the prairie,
telling
of outrages on the frontier, and it soon
became a settled opinion that Santa Anna,
like the Bourbons, could neither forget nor
learn. It became evident that the horrid
butcheries of past years were again to be
enacted
on Texan soil. That Santa Anna, who
had been dragged from a swamp, clad in the
garb of one of his lacquey's, after the battle of
San Jacintopresenting a rather
contemptible
image of despair, had not forgiven the
Texans for sparing his life. In a certain view
of the matter he was right, for if even a
murderer
forfeited his life, by a series of
cold-blooded
butcheries, that murderer was Don
Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna.
Among other rumors it was announced that
Don General Something, from the Oresidio
del Rio Grande, was approaching the
western
frontier, in formidable force, his object,
the possession and plunder of San Antonio,
near which still arose the blackened walls of
the Alama.
These rumors reached the solitude of
Prairie
Eden. One morning,it was when the
spring of 1842 was melting into summer.
John had a mysterious and energetic
conversation
with his father; and ere an hour had
passed, the entire population of Prairie Eden,
numbering nearly seventy men of all colors
and nations, had taken horse and rifle, and
ridden away in the direction of San Antonio
De Bexar.
Mr. Jacob Grywin and his daughter 'Bel,
alone remained on the Island knoll.
At the head of the Volunteers of Prairie
Eden rode the brothers, John and Harry. By
their side, the overseeer of the plantation,
Red Ewen McGregor, a man of gigantic
frame and rude aspect, who seemed
connected
with the old man by some mysterious and
indefinable tie.
It was John's object to advance to San
Antonio
,
with all his disposable force, join his
men with other bands of volunteers, and make
a Texan resistance to the approaching
Mexican
army. He did not contemplate an
absence
of more than one week from Prairie
Eden. The isolated position of his father's
mansionso they all saidwas it's surest
defence against any predatory attack.
Let us now return to this night in the
spring or early summer of 1842.
CHAPTER III.
THE CHAMBER OF 'BEL OF PRAIRIE EDEN.
`A hideous alternative,your honor or
his
life.
Texan MSS
.
It
was deep night, and the stars shone with
their calm, sad light over the mansion and the
grove of Prairie Eden.
In the mansion all was still as death. The
old man slumbered in his chamber on the
ground floor; his daughter slept in her room
on the second floor. All the other chambers
were tenantless, and a silence like the tomb
brooded over the corridors of that prairie
home. The wind sighed mournfully through
the tops of the trees, as their mossy branches
swept the roof. The sound of the island
fountain
,
making low music, as it bubbled from
its cavern source, was heard in every pausa
of the breeze.
Yet within the mansiontenanted only by
the old man and his childall was darkness
and silence.
The Chamber of Isabel!
A large room, lighted by a lamp that stands
upon a table near the bed, and sheds a feeble
and flickering ray. It is shadowy here, in
this bower of virgin repose, and yet you may
discern the luxurious details of the place.
Soft matting on the floor, whose down-like
texture would not return too rudely, the
pressure
of an infant's naked foot. Curtains of
pale crimson silk, hanging from the ceiling,
nd imparting a warm roseate glow io the
face of the sleeper. Yonder an image of the
Divine Virgin, a marble shape, elevated on its
snowy pedestal, and over the mantel a picture
of a wild-wood scene in far-distant
Pennsylvania
.
The bed, with curtains, and coverlet, and
pillows, all like a snow bank freshly fallen
from the sky, so pure, so white, so spotless.
The curtain is slightly parted; through the
interval
gleams the vision of that face, framed
in the darkly flowing hair, and pillowed on
right arm, that bosom, which now is lost to
view, and now quivers into light, above the
tremulous lace of the night robe. A beautiful
woman slumbering; with her lips, so ripe in
their red bloom, gently parted, until they
disclose
the white teeth; the eyes closed, with
the long black fringes resting on the cheek
It is a sight for angels to behold and love.
She tosses in her slumberyou see a full
round arm, with its small hand, all beautiful
as an arm and hand of alabaster, tinted by
the daybreak flush extened from the curtains.
You hear a whispered word. Then the
sleeper
sinks again into repose like death, and a
single black tress, curves over her neck and
nestles on her bosom.
At this moment a faint, creaking sound is
heard, and all is still again. The door slowly
opens, and a face, leering with a hideous
smile, appears in the dusky interval. A
cautious
,
cat-like footstep, and a form advances
to the maiden's bed, and the light of the taper
reveals a strange picture.
That face, with short stiff hair and shaggy
beard, alike scarlet red in hue, the bleared
eyes and the thick lips, laughing the same
brutal scorn upon the sleeping woman, that
almost giant form, clad in the costume of a
Mexican Ranchero, wide pantaloons,
ornamented
with glittering buttons, green jacket,
tawdry with gilt trappings and a stout leather
belt, girdling two pistols and a long and
quivering
knife.
Who is this ruffian that dares intrude upon
the sanctity of a maiden's bed chamber?
He sweeps aside the curtains, bends his
head, his breath pollutes the cheeks of the
slumbering Isabel.
You see his thick lips parting in a brutal
grin, his huge arms extended, his colorless
eyeballsso white, and bleared, and glossy
fire with a gloating intensity.
The white breast, the round neck, the warm
countenance of Isabel lay open to that gaze
of pollution.
He turns to the doorlistens. All is
still! The hand of the ruffin plays upon the
hilt of his knife, but it is for a moment only.
Extending his brawny arms, he grasps her
form and tears her, half-naked, from her
virgin
bed.
In a moment the room is vacant. The
outlines
of that pure woman's form is still traced
upon the pillow, the lamp yet burns on the
table, but the room is silent and tenantless.
But did you see that unconscious form,
bound in the ruffian's arms; did youeven
as he left the roomsee that face, turned
over his shoulder. The long, black hair
showering down his back, as the eyes
unclosed
with a frightened glance?
There is a gasping, half-suppressed cry in
the corridor withouta hurried footstep and
all is still again.
When Isabel, thus rudely torn from her
bed, unclosed her eyes, she beheld the dark
green hangings of the eastern room on the
ground floor.
Pinioned in the ruffian's arm, she gazed
around with the frightened glance of one
suddenly
aroused from a dreamless slumber, and
beheld that wide room crowded by the forms
of armed men, attired in the half-bandit,
half-soldier
costume of Mexican rancheroes. A
solitary ruffian stood alone in the centre of
the group, his slender form and bearded face,
revealed by the light of the blazing pine knot,
which he raised above his head with his right
hand.
That light flashed strongly over the green
jackets and tinsel trappings of the soldiers,
and played upon the blade of every long and
quivering knife.
For a moment the maiden trembled with
fright as she beheld that swarty face,
scowling
all around her, but that moment passed,
the warm blood coursed over her face and
bosom; with a sudden movement she flung
herself from the ruffian's arms and
confronted
the assassin band.
`Why this outrage?' she cried, dashing
the clustering hair aside from her face, and
fixing the glance of an indignant eye upon
the foremost of the group. She looked very
beautiful, that half-clad woman, whose
clasped
arms were dressed upon her tumultuous
bosom, with her unbound hair streaming over
her white shoulders.
There was dead stillness, and then a deep
groan from the dark recesses of the room.
The bandits parted, and in the interval
made by their movement to either side,
appeared
an old man, whose slender form was
clad in plain black, while his strongly
marked
features were rendered ghastly by a livid
paleness.
`My father! You here, bound too, and in
these ruffians arms?'
The old man, Jacob Grywin, replied by
wringing his pinioned arms and uttering a
low, deep moan.
`My sons! my sons! why did I suffer them
to depart for San Antonio? My men, too
all are gone, and here I am. Would to God
I had only faithful Ewen here!'
He spoke of the overseer of his plantation,
that brave hardy fellow, who had left for San
Antonio in company with his sons.
A hoarse laugh echoed round the chamber
at once Jocob looked up, and Isabel turned
as though a viper had bit her heel.
`Your `faithful Ewen is here!' said the
voice of the ruffian, who had torn Isabel from
her bed.
There he stood, dressed like the
rancheroes
,
his stiff red hair and matted red beard
imparting new hideousness to his bleared eyes
and grinning lips.
The old man was speechless. You see
Isabella survey the ruffian from head to foot,
while her face changes color, now red as
day-break
,
now white as a shroud.
`Aye, it's me:Ewen McGregor, Red
Ewen, or whatever the boys choose to call
me! I
am
here! This band of trusty spirits
are mine. I have come here at dead of night
to secure this traitor to the Republic of
Mexico
.We
had hard riding to reach the place in
timea great many weary miles since nine
o'clock. Somewhat in a hurry, you know;
for to-morrow morning your sons will be home
bye-the-by, I left John and Harry at
sunset
.
They were quite well.'
He drew his knife and playfully felt its
sharp edge.
`My God! can this be real? moaned the
old man.
`I tell you it can be, and it is.'
`But you were my friendmy overseer
you followed my fortunes into the wilderness
Ewen a traitor! No, no! I will not
believe
it.'
The ruffian advanced, confronted the old man
and glowered upon him with his blood-shot
eyes,
`You talk of traitor
you
. The broken
bank director of Philadelphia, who turned
traitor
to the trust of some thousand widows
and orphans, and then fled the city, seeking
refuge for his guilty wealth in the prairie of
Texas, sixty miles from San Antonio. Oh,
Jacob! Pshaw, man! I know you. You
forget that I was your clerk.'
It was a hard blow; the old man felt it to
the heart.
As for Isabel, she stood like a thing of
marble
,
frightfully pale, her clasped hands
pressed
nervously against her bared bosom.
`You here too, my pretty one!' the ruffian
sneered, as he turned upon her. `In my
power! You were once the
aristocratic
lady
of the aristocratic mansion, in Philadelphia.
Now
'
A movement was observable among the
soldiers and a form advanced into the glare of
the pine torch.
It was a young man slenderly made, with
an olive cheek and long flowing curls of jet
black hair. His beard and moustache, all
curling and as soft as silk, imparted a
chivalric
appearance to his delicately cut features.
His eyes were very large and bright, and
withal intensely black. Their expression was
peculiar, indefinable.
A close-fitting uniform of dark green,
relieved
by a single row of gold buttons,
displayed
the elegant proportions of his form.
`Isabel,' he whispered, `we did not
anticipate
this moment when last we met.'
He bowed low before the half-clad maiden,
and looked on her with upraised eyes.
`Don Antonio!' was all that trembled from
the lips of the wondering girl.
It was a strange group. The central figures
that handsome soldier with the olive cheek
and smooth silken beard; the beautiful girl,
whose flowing hair but faintly concealed the
fluttering of her bosom; the light held
over-head
by the brigand soldier, the livid face of
the father, and the brutal sneer of Ewen,
distinctly
revealed by its glarethe encircling
rancheroes and the dark background of the
curtained walls.
A strange group, now shown in red light,
again darkened by the shadows as they went
and came.
Don Antonio drew near the maiden,
extending
an elegent cloak of rich purple
velvet
,
edged with golden fringe. Gently he
flung it over her shoulders, and as her bosom
was veiled beneath its solds, he
whispered
,
`Isabel! for the sake of the Holy Trinity,
let me see you
alone
alone, for one moment
only.'
He spoke in English, somewhat fluently,
though with a decided Spanish accent. There
seemed a more eloquent language; so thought
Isabel, in his large lustrous eyes.
`Come!' she whispered and led the way
from the room.
`You must be in a hurry, I tell ye,' they
heard the coarse tones of Red Ewen, `for we
have got a heap of justice to do, and little
time to do it in.'
Up the stairway she led him, and scarce
knowing whither she went, entered the
bed-chamber
from which she had been torn only
a moment past.
There, by the light of the taper, which
stood upon the table, near the bed, there, in
silence and gloom of that virgin retreat, they
confronted each other.
Isabel, very pale, with her white arms,
appearing
from the folds of the purple cloak, her
naked feet touching the soft matting on the
floor; Don Antonio, with his brow uncovered
his head drooped, his upturned eyes, resting
on the half-shrouded form before him.
`Speak,' she gasped; `this outrage'
The words died on her tongue.
In a voice tremulous with delicate
modulations
,
Don Antonio spoke, still maintaining
that resyectful bearing.
`You are in danger, Isabel! Last
Thursday
,
at our nearest military post, sixty miles
away, this ruffian Ewen appeared,
denounced
your father to the colonel of our regiment,
stated the unprotected situation of Prairie
Eden, and offered to lead a picked squadron
to the place.'
`Ah! I remember he was absent two days
last week. But what charge could the traitor
prefer against my father?'
You know, Isabel, that our Government
have decreed a new invasion of the rebellious
Province of Texas. Our armies, even now,
are encamped on its southern border. Ewen
stated that your father's house was often used
as a rendezvous for the rebel Texans. Nay,
that his sons, his laborers, his very slaves,
within a few days depart to join the army of
some Texan General at San Antonio. I fear
me it will go very hard with your father.
This Ewen is as cruel, as brutal, as traitors
always are.'
`But you can save us! You whom we
knew in our prosperous days.'
A meaning smile crossed the face of the
Mexican.
`I am only a subordinate officer. Red
Ewen met us after sunset, at a designated
point, and took command of this squadron of
horse.'
`And my father?'
`May be put to death within an hour. Red
Ewen seems to have some secret purpose of
revenge.'
Isabel sank to the floor; not prostrate, but
kneeling with her white arms upraised, her
eyes streaming tears!
`My God! it seems like a hideous dream.'
The Mexican raised his hand to his eyes
was it to hide a tear?
`But you can save us, Don Antonio!' And
with a bound she passed the distance between
them, and knelt at his feet. You
will
save
us! I see how it isyou only accompanied
this expedition to do us service. O remember
how my father's home in Philadelphia was
once your home; remember'
`How the peerless Isabel scorned the suit
of Don Antonio Marin, the attache of the
Mexican legation, at Washington. Is it so,
Miss Grywin?'
Was that a sneer upon his dark-red lip?
What meant that sudden lighting up of his
large eyes?
Isabel trembled, shuddered as she beheld
the sudden change of the Mexican's face. In
an instant that expression was gone; he was
composed and respectful again.
`O, you would not be so ungenerous as to
revive that memory now! I was but young
vain, frivolous then. I refused your suit it is
true; my father to that refusal added some
words, at once needless and bitter; but now,
we are in danger; you will save us!'
`Rise, lady! On one condition I will
peril my life to save you.'
He raised her gently from the floor. She
stood there, erect as a queen upon her throne.
Around her neck waved her glossy black hair.
You could see her young bosom pant and
writhe beneath the velvet cloak.
`One condition!' she murmured; and
waited
for him to speak.
He spoke it with his eyes. With his
parting
lips. With that sudden gaze which
devoured
every outline, every tint of her
voluptuous
form, from the head framed in the
black hair, to the feet as white as marble.
She shrank back as though a bullet had
pierced her brain.
`No! No! No! You cannot be so base
as to think it!'
`Isabel' the whisper, husky with
passion
,
fell on her ear like a torrent of boiling
lead. `The case is plain. I love youhave
loved you for years. Be mine, and I will
sacrifice my rank, my honor, to serve you!'
`Be mine!'she echoed his words, and
looked at him with a dumb, wandering stare.
He beckoned her to the window.
`Look yonder!'
She looked, but would not believe her eyes.
There rolled the prairie, silvered by the
rising
moon, but she saw it not, nor dwelt on
the solemn beauty of that boundless sky.
But a pine torch flung its ruddy glow over
the sward in front of the mansion. That
light revealed the bandit soldiers, the form of
Red Ewen in their midst. There, with his
neck bared, his brow uncovered, his face
livid
as death, stood her father.
There was a rope about his neck, and that
rope swung loosely, as it was tied to the
oaken
branch above his head.
Isabel beheld that hideous picture, and sunk
like a crushed flower, on the floor. All sense,
all consciousness were gone. Her white
arms, relieved by the purple cloak, dropped
by her side, a glimpse of her pulseless bosom
gleamed over the golden edge of the garment.
She lay like a dead woman, her face like
marble, her eyes wide open and glassy.
Don Antonio bore her to the bed, and
stamped his foot thrice upon the floor. A
burly
ranchero appeared in the shadows of the
doorway; it was Red Ewen, in his hunter's
garb.
`Wine, slave! Search the cellars of the
old heretic, and bring me a goblet of his rich
old wine!'
This, it must be confessed, did not look
very much like respecting Red Ewen as the
superior officer
.
A few brief moments passedthe lady
still lay swooningand Ewen, the
newly-fledged
rachero appeared with a massy
golden
cup in his hand, its glittering flowers
contrasting
with the purple gleam of the liquid
trembling against the brim.
`Begone! And mark ye,
Don
Ewen,
commander
of the squadron of Mexican horse!
do as I have commanded you. Begone!
The ranchero was gone. Don Antonio was
alone with the unconscious woman. What
means that scowl glooming over his
handsome
face? What means that hand lifted
over the gobletthat white powder, pouring
from the paper in his fingers down into the
red current of the wine?
He gazed upon her, his black eyes
dilating
until they assumed a tiger-like glare. So
helpless she lay beside him, unconscious, upon
her virgin bed, with her dark hair wound
about her round white throat; so like an
image
of purity, carved out of Parian marble,
with her glassy eyes turned towards heaven!
Ah, that was a coward act, Don Antonio!
To sweep the cloak aside and gaze with
gloating eyes upon the shrine of purityher
white and pulseless bosom. Ah, that was a
traitor's kiss; that kiss from your burning lips
pressed upon her lips as cold as clay.
`Awake! Isabel, my love! I will save your
father!'
His arm is around her waisthe presses
his bearded cheek against her cheek of
velvet
softness, and his lips, pressed with
passion
,
quiver against hers.
Dreamily she unclosed her eyes, and all
unconscious as she was, drank from the
goblet
which he held to her lips.
Then her countenance glowed, a blush like
living flame overspread her face, her eyes
seemed no fire with liquid light.
`Where am I?' she gasped. `Ah, these
forms that glide to and fro in the dance, these
fountains that murmur drowsily in mine
ears, these gardens, where a thousand lights
break from the shadowy trees over groves of
flowers.'
`Her mind wanders!' and Don Antonio
smiled until his white teeth shone like ivory
under his black moustache.
The maiden rose, spread forth her arms.
like one struggling with a fatal sleep. The
cloak fell, and that form, which combined
all that is beautiful in the physical and
intellectual
organization of woman, glowed in the
light, form its trembling veil. The drugged
potion was in her veinsyou can see it in the
voluptuous dimness of her eyes, in the deeper
red of her lips.
Even in this moment her soul shone out,
from the clouds which had begun to
darken
it.
`Ah! where am I? Don Antonio, is it
you? My fatheroh, save him!' such were
her incoherent words.
Don Antonio started to his feet, and at once
there gleamed from his eyes a strange light
there broke over his lips a stranger smile.
`Listen, Isabel,but two minutes of
consciousness
,
of volition are yours! In those
brief minutes I will lay your fate before you
aye, and you shall read it. Two years
ago, in the city of Washington, you scorned
my suit. Scorned! Your father heaped
insult
upon your scorn. My time has come!
Unless you become minemine at this hour,
mine without priest or vow, I swear to leave
your father to his fate'
`Mercy!'
`That fate, death by the rope, at the hands
of the ruffian, Red Ewen! Your brothers will
return by morning light, but it will be too late
we will then be far on our way; but your
father will swing on that tree, before the door
of his home!'
`You cannot be human! Not one drop of
pity, not one'
`Reflect! I do not force your wishes.
You may swoon, but unless you say `yes' to
my proposal, your father shall hang, and you
will not feel my kiss upon your lips! Say
`yes,' and I will save him. I that love you
with a love that is merciless in its every
pulsation
.
I that adore you so much that I will
wreck every moment of your existence unless
you consent to become mine!'
He shook his small white hands above his
head in the impulse of the fiery thought
which corded every muscle of his face, and
gleamed like an undying vengeance from his
eyes.
`One moment only remains! ThinkI
will not speak to you until that moment and
consciousness are gone!'
He turned away into the darker corner of
the room.
Standing near the bed, her form erect, her
black hair tossing on her brow, she felt that
the drugged potion was working in her veins,
and that the next minute would fire her heart
with the mad dream of voluptuous passion.
Her mind was very clearlike a lake en
shrined in the hollow of a mountain top, its
glassy surface unruffled by a breeze But the
next moment!
Slowly, she glided to the window. Again
that sight.the livid face, the dangling rope.
With a creeping shudder she turned away,
and turned her eyes upon the tempter.
In the dim corner he stood, his finger
pressed
against his lip, his dark eyes blazing upon
her even through the gloom!
Pity her now, all good angels!
She felt the blood rushing to her brain;
she heard gentle voices singing songs, as in
the air; she saw soft masses of light playing
over the uncovered forms of dancing women.
Like a sleep that dream, born of opium,
possessed her nerves, her brain, her soul!
`Yes!'
It is morning, and a faint ray of light
trembles
through the darkness of the corridor.
Let us await, in this silence and gloom, with
our eyes fixed upon the massive panels of
yonder door. That door leads into the
bed-chamber
of Isabel.
Forth from that door, as the rising sun
streams through the window, glides a wild
figure, with unbound hair, and livid blue
circles
under each glassy eye. The bosom is
bare, and maked the feet,you see the air
play with the scanty robe,but the feet are
cold, the bosom white, pulseless, like the
frozen
breast of a dead woman.
Is it a ghost? Can it be the warm and
blooming Isabel, who last night said the
evening
prayer with her father, and went singing to
her wirgin bed?
Along the corridor she glides, one word
quivering from her lips`Father!'
No reply,the mansion is deathly still.
Down the stairs, and out upon the porch.
The rolling prairie, with the sun rising over
its waves of grass and flowersthe blue sky
and the grouping clouds, who hang above the
path of day, catching his freshest kiss upon
their bosoms.
She saw it allfelt on her cold cheek the
fresh breath of morning. But the soldiers!
where are they? EwenDon Antonio
where? They are gone, all gone. She is left
alone with her father. How can she meet his
gaze! She, thebut pity her good angels,
and weep fiends, as you behold your darkest
work!
`Father!' she cried, and listened.
Noreply
.
She turned from the sunrise, and
shuddered
as she anticipated the withering gaze of
that parent, whose life she had bought with
hersoul.
She turned, and saw her father. He did
not frown upon his child, nor smile. There
was a cold, calm look upon his face, and his
eyes were steadily turned to the rising sun.
But those eyes were glassy, that face was
discolored
,
for the father dangled in the air, as
the rope was about his neck, and the
tree-branch
quivered with his weight.
Two forms were seen towards the East.
She saw them, as they came rapidly on, and
greeted them with a shout of horrible
laughter
.
`Welcome, JohnHarry, welcome home.'
CHAPTER IV.
THE RANCHO SALADO.
`There came an order from Santa Anna,
stating that as these Texans, who had
honorably capitulated at Mier, were pirates
and robbers, every tenth man of them
should'
Texan MSS
.
It
was a dreary rancho of dark stone, one
story in height, with a stunted and withered
tree before its low and narrow door. To the
east extended a wall of stone, of the same hue
as that which formed the rancho, only that a
few miserable shrubs struggled into light
between
the solid blocks.
Around that rancho all was one
monotonous
waste of sand, as far as the eye could
see, and far in the east and west rose a range
of barren hills, their rugged peaks rushing
into the sunset sky.
A view more desolate cannot be imagined.
The rancho, with its wall, encircling a space
some hundred feet square, was the only object
that met the eye in all that waste of dreary
sand and barren cliffs.
A single black cloud, with rugged edges,
spread over the tops of the western hills, and
veiled, as in a pall, the lust beams of the
dying
sun.
The air was hot, stifling, like the
atmosphere
of a furnace. It was the close of a
long and sultry day. A flock of vultures were
perched upon the flat roof of the rancho,
folding their sluggish wings, as they seemed
to scent the smell of human blood.
Before the door waited a half-robber form,
dressed in the tawdry green jacket and wide
trowsers of a Mexican ranchero. There were
pistols in his belt, as leaning on his rusty mus
ket, he cast his sleepy eyes to the setting
sun.
This lonely farm house, or military post,
call it what you will, was situated in the
heart of Mexico, some hundred and fifty miles
south of the city of Saltillo.
It was called the
Rancho Salado
.
Within the court yard, hidden by the
impenetrable
wall, a scene of peculiar interest
was in progress.
One hundred and seventy men, chained in
couples, their faces worn by famine, and
rendered
more hideous by the uncombed hair
and unshaven beard, were grouped in a circle.
Their shrunken forms, wasted by long days
and nights of thirst, hunger and cold, were
miserably clad in rags that fluttered to every
breeze.
In the centre of that circle was a massive
log, and on that log an earthen vessel
resembling
an antique funeral urn.
Around these gaunt and famine-stricken
forms was grouped a solid mass of Mexican
steel. At least three hundred soldiers attired
in green, gazed on the chained men, and
raised
thelr musquets in the light of the setting
sun.
Near yonder post, the colonel of the
detachment
,
a man of some thirty-five years, with a
dark olive face, rests his arms against the
wall and turns his face away from the group
of prisoners. This colonel has seen much
bloodshed, and washed his blade on many a
Texan field, but now the tears stream freely
down his battle-worn cheeks.
His officers, young men and aged, clad in
the gay Mexican array, gaze on the group
with wet eyes and quivering lips.
Only one man,you see him slightly
advanced
from the othersgazes upon the
miserable
men, with an aspect cold, stony and
unpitying as Death. He is by no means an
unhandsome man, for his beard is dark and
silken, his hair glossy as a raven's pinion,
his eyes full and lustrous.
He gazes apon the prisoners and the urn
and smiles, until his teeth glare out from
beneath
his moustache.
Have we seen this man before?
The colonel advances; as if choking down
his emotions, he surveys the group and speaks.
The Priest by his side, with dark brown and
rotund face, translates his words into
English
.
Texans! Taken prisoners in an attack
made by you, last Christmas day, on the
town of Mier, situated in the Republic of
Mexico, you were brought, some months since,
to this rancho, on your way to the city of
Mexico. You rose on the guard, shot and
stabbed our sentinels, and escaped. After
days and nights of starvation and misery,
worse than death, you were re-taken, and
again you stand upon the scene of your mad
adventures. Texans! By the order of Don
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anua, President of
the Republic, you are declared pirates and
robbers, out of the pale of all international
law, and stripped of all the rights of civilized
communities. You are worthy of death,
in the most sudden and ignominious form,
but,
in mercy
'there was a convulsive
movement
in the brave Colonel's throat, which
well-nigh choked his voice`in mercy, I
say, the President decrees that only one out
of every ten men shall be put to death.'
He paused,and as though embarrassed by his
emotions, played for a moment with the hilt
of his sword. You see, his officers stand
weeping near yonder wall, and still, with his
uncovered brow, glowing in the light of the
setting sun, stands that solitary and unpitying
cavalier, with the dark hair and silken beard,
`Within that urn are deposited one
hundred
and seventy beans; seventeen black
ones, among one hundred and fifty-three white
ones. You will advance two by two, and
draw each of you, from the urn a single
bean. If it is white, you live,black and
you die before sunset.'
He turned away, and the Texans looked
silently in each other's faces. The unpitying
officerdid we ever see him before?
advanced
,
passed through the prisoners, and
took his seat on the log. The priest handed
him a large blank book, with pen and ink.
This man was to enter the names of the
living
and the dead,as one by one, they raised
the death-urn.
The air seemed to grow more sultry, and
a strange silence descended upon the scene.
While the Colonel and his officers were
moved to tearswhile even the rough
soldiers
wept, as they grasped their muskets
while that solitary, unpitying man, seated by
the urn, looked coolly in the faces of the
Texans, they advanced two by two and
chained
as they were, inserted every man his hand
in the urn of death.
The first couplea man with sinewy form
and hair like snow, and a man whose robust
figure indicated the wreck of Herculean
strength.
At once they inserted their hands: there
was a pause. Sobs were heard from the
group of Mexican officers. The Register of
the Deadso let us c ll the handsome
officer
,
who, seated on the log, holds the book
of life and deathcoolly watched their
movements
,
as though he had wagered a few
dollars
on the result.
The old man drew a black bean.
`Death!' cried the Register, as he entered
his name on the book.
The old man, whose features, covered with
a snow-white beard, belied not one trace of
emotion, whispered to his comrade
`Should you ever return to Texas,I have
a daughter,you will bear to her my
blessing
?'
The Herculean Texan could not reply.
The manacles were loosened, and the aged
man calmly stepped aside, and stood erect on
the spot allotted to the doomed.
The horrible lottery went on in solemn
silence
,
only broken by the sobs of the
Mexican
officers,the sneering laugh of the
gallant
Register, who cried, `Life,' or `Death,'
as though he was but marking the result of a
game of cards.
You may believe me, that it was a sad
scene. The sun never shone on a sight more
harrowing. Two by two they advanced, these
heroes of Mier, who had mothers, wives,
sisters
in the sunny land which they had bought
with their bloodthe beautiful land of Texas.
Not a groan from their lipsno! not even
a sigh. Half naked, unshaven, and
miserable
to look upon, they came, two by two to
the urn, raised their faces in the sunset glare,
and calmly took their places in the ranks of
life and death.
At last, when the setting sun trembled on
the hill-top, his red disc seen between the
cliff and the black cloud above, there stood
sixteen men, side by side, on the spot
assigned
to the condemned.
Two Texans only remained to fulfill the
conditions of the lottery; there was but one
black bean in the urn, and one of the twain
must die.
Every eye was fixed upon them as they
advanced
.
You see the tallest of the two, a man of
sinewy form, and aquiline face. His broad
chest quivers beneath its covering of rags
ah! unmanly spectaclethere are tears in
his large dark eyes.
Why these tears?for himself? Look at
the prisoner chained to his wrist, and answer!
A very boy; scarce sixteen, with a girlish
form, and smooth, beardless cheek, and
strangely lustrous blue eyes. His face, too,
is worn by famine; but there is a calm,
almost
holy light upon his soft features; he looks
up into the face of the robust man, and a sad
smile wreathes his lips.
`Fear not for me, brotherI'll not play the
coward!' he says, in a distinct firm tone.
`Fear not for
you
,' and a hoarse groan
swelled the broad chest of the bearded Texan.
`By  I swear, I do not fear for you; you
shall not die. Nono! That would be a
little
too hard for the devil himself to think.
Hark ye, Harry'this in a hasty whisper
`let me draw first: the black bean is smaller
than the whiteI can tell one from the other
by the touch. I will'
The younger brother replied by thrusting
his hand into the urn.
There was one groan thrilling from every
lip in the courtyard. The chivalric Register
alone regarded the scene with a pleasant
smile, and politely asked,
`The color of the bean?'
`
Black!
' cried the heroic boy, turning
with a triumphant smile to his brother. That
brother wrung his manacled hands and bowed
his head upon his breastit would have made
your blood run cold to see that strong man
weeping like a child.
`Name?' added the polite Register,
smoothing
his silken moustache.
`
Harry Grywin!
' replied the boy, in a
firm tone.
The Register started, his face became pale,
almost livid for an instant, but recovering his
composure he coolly entered the name.
Murmuring
,
`Harry Grywin
Death!
'
This scene did not pass unobserved. No!
The doomed sixteen men saw it, the Mexican
officers shuddered as they beheld the black
bean in the hands of the girlish boy, and ten
Texans stepped from the ranks of the living
exclaiming incoherently,
`I will take his place.'`By  you
cannot
kill that boy!'`Behold us! We will die
in his stead!'
But a voice deeper than all rung through
the court yard,
`Who talks of dying for Harry Grywin,
when his brother, I, John Grywin, am here?
Look you, he is but a childyou cannot put
him to death. The foolish boy saw the bean
before he drew ithe denied himself the
shadow of a chance. Take me!'
His tall form swelled in every fibre as he
towered erect, the red glow of the setting sun
lighting up his aquiline features, framed in
masses of hair and beard as black as jet.
`Take! Look you, my Mexican friends,
I do not owe you much love. I have cut and
carved you in battle, as I would cut and carve
again, had I free field and a good knife. But
now I will stoop to you, kneel to you. Come,
priest, tell it to them in Spanish, only so that
you will let me die in place of Harry here,
for as there's a God, he looks the very image
of his mother.'
The tones of that strong man, his tears, his
gestures, had a language which went like a
fiery arrow to every heart.
`This must not go on,' shouted the veteran
Colonel, rushing forward,`These men shall
not die! And the boy; Holy Trinity! it would
be sacrilege to kill him.'
The Register sprang upon the log, with his
fine form and handsome face revealed against
the sunset sky.
`Fall back, Colonel; I command here,' he
said, quietly waving his hand.
`But your Excellency,Don Antonio
Marin
'
At that name, John Grywin looked up and
surveyed the handsome form of the Register,
Don Antonio Marin. It was horrible to
remark
the strange pallor of the Texan's face,
the iron impression of his bearded lips.
`Don Antonio Marin!' he exclaimed;`Oh
sir, I am glad to know you!'
`Separate these heretics,' shouted Don
Antonio
with rapid utterance and violent
gestures
.
Quick, I say! The sun is setting and
it must be over before he is below the
horizon
.
Soldiers, advance by platoons; to your
dutypresentfire!'
It was done like a lightning flash. Harry
was separated from the brother's side, hurried
away into the ranks of the Doomed; there
was a report like separate claps of thunder,
mingling in one awful peal, and a mass of
blueish smoke rolled over the scene.
Groans, prayers, low-muttered curses
mingling
in chorus! Do you see the smoke-shroud
roll aside for a moment? That old man on
his knees, lifting his hands in prayer? The
red blaze pours into his face and the
smoke-cloud
rolls over them all. Peal on peal,
volley
on volley, and now the whole courtyard is
veiled in smoke.
An awful silence.
The smoke slowly rolls aside. Ah, those
mangled forms, with here and there a limb
quivering with the last impulse of life, a hand
raised, but to fall stiff and frozen to the
ground, a face uplifted, with the blood
pouring
over the hollow stomach, which but a
moment
ago were eyes.
There, on the log, beside the fatal urn,
stands Don Antonio Marin, gazing coolly on
the bloody heap of dying and dead, while his
curling hair, and silked beard, and smooth
olive cheek glow richly in the sun, as he
lights a cigareto and emits volumes of
perfumed
smoke from his vermillion lips.
Near him, John Grywin, frozen into a dead
stupor, his hands clasped, and his vacant gaze
rolling from the mangled forms to the soldiers
and last of all resting on that prominent
figure.
Don Antonio, standing on the log and
puffing
his cigareto with infinite relish, his face
and beard encircled by clouds of fragrant
smokeas the sun dips below the horizon
and night rushes on the scene.
CHAPTER V.
THE LADY OF VERA CRUZ.
It was on the ninth of March, 1847, that
Winfield Scott, landed with 12,000
Americans
,
on the very coast where Cortes, with
300 Spaniards had landed three centuries
ago.
Texan MSS
.
The
white arm of a woman, thrust through
the staples of that massive door, with the
iron pressed against the delicate flesh,
supplied
the place of a bolt and held the panels
firm.
It was a fearful thing to behold that arm,
quivering and almost crushed by the sturdy
blows which fell against the opposite side of
the door. And yet the arm was firm, pressed
by the heavy panels of the door, against the
rusted staples, into which it was inserted, it
trembled like a withered reed, the small
fingers
,
straightened with intense agony, the
skin was rent by the overwhelming pressure,
but still it was therethe only bolt of the
iron-bound door.
The scene was a narrow room, with a
lofty ceiling and floor of dark grey stone.
From the tapestry on either side, marked with
the figures 1716, the portraits of grave
Hidalgos
,
encircled by heavy frames, and
manifesting
in their steel armor, their bearded
faces and helmetted brows, distinct traces of
the age of chivalry, frowned gloomily on that
brave and lonely woman.
The only light which imparted its faint
glow to the place wrs a small lamp uplifted in
the left arm of the maiden. Her right arm
was inserted in the place of a bolt. For
some two or three feet around her the rays of
the lamp fell warm and glaring; beyond that
circle of light in which she stood all was
gloom, and the extreme end of the apartment
was enveloped in thick darkness.
For a single moment all is still as death.
While this dead silence broods on the place,
while the thick darkness hangs over its distant
extreme, and the faces of warrior Spaniards
frown from the tapestried walls, we will gaze
upon this brave yet delicate girl.
Her half-naked form is pressed quiveringly
against the dark mahogany panels. That
massive
door supplies a black background to the
lithe outlines of her shape, and strongly
relieves
the alabaster whiteness of her shoulders,
her feet, her arms and bosom.
A solitary garment, hastily gathered around
her waist, falls in careless and loosening folds
to the floor. Her young bosom heaves freely
in the light. You may trace the agitation
which swells her heart to bursting, in the
almost
imperceptible quivering of the nostril.
You may read it in that silent compression of
the warm, red lips. It brightens wildly in
those dark eyes, dilating in their sockets, and
gleaming a steady lustre from the shadow of
the long black lashes.
A single vein, swoollen as though it was
about to burst, shoots upward from her brows
and mars the pale beauty of her forehead.
Her hairthere is not a breath to stir it into
motionfalls in one mass of glossy
blackness
over her right shoulder.
Her form is neither tall nor masculine.
She trembles before us, one of that
diminutive
shapes which supply in grace and
lightness
what they lack in height and majesty. A
slender form, yet blooming freshly in the full
bosom; warm, almost voluptuous, in the
flowing
outline of the broad shoulders and
rounded
arms; beautiful in the stainless whiteness
of her small feet and hands, wild and flashing
with the light of large deep eyes that seem to
burn as they dilate. Altogether one of those
small yet impetuous daughters of the South,
who resemble the tigers in their stealthy tread
and, not in each movement only, but also in
their love and their revenge.
What means this picture, framed by the
darkmahogany panels of the massive door?
This solitary room, gloomy with tapestry and
moth eaten portraits, floored with stone, and
with a single doorway, at either extreme?
the white arm, thrust through the iron staples,
the enlarging eye and bared bosom,
throbbing
with death-like emotion?
Wherefore, with a picture, so mysterious
and yet so beautiful in its very danger and
mystery, commence this new page in this
legend
of the golden and bloody land?
From this dim room, faintly illumined by
the lamp that quivers in the uplifted arm of
the maiden, we will go forth, on our
pilgrimage
,
through the dusky battle-gods and
sepulceres
of Mexico. It is in the Home that the
bolt of war descends in its most terrible glare
and reaps its most precious harvest of blood;
in the Home we will raise the curtain, and
lay bare the awful theatre of revenge, over
whose blood-stained bounds glide the phantoms
of human passion.
Hark! this silence, so death-like, is broken
by the sound of repeated blows, hurled against
the opposite side of the door. Deep voices
are heard in the interval between each
blow.
`Open, sister! Your brother demands
entrance
into this chamber!'
`Open, Isora; it is your betrothed that
calls!'
One quick and intense glance toward
yonder
door, almost hidden in the gloomit is
the door of her bed chamber; and the girl
silently
withdrew her arm. The blood starts
from the white skin, and a livid streak
deforms
its alabaster loveliness.
The door swings slowly into the room;
two figures are disclosed, half-advanced from
the shadows of the doorway. A monk and a
soldier; the monk with his pale face sunken
on his folded arms; the soldier with an
unsheathed
sword gleaming in the light.
`Sister!' said the monk, in a voice at once
sad and reproachful, `this dishonor is too
great to be borne. An Americanaye, a
heretic, a spy, is discovered at dead of night,
in the streets of Vera Cruz. He is pursued
by Mexicans; his accursed life is in their
power; and lo! a Mexican girl, the orphan
child of Don Antonio Marin gives shelter to
this spya shelter in the home of her dead
father, shelter in the secresy of her
bed-chamber
!'
`Where is he?' hissed the soldier, as his
bearded face and tinselled form were
disclosed
in the light; `this sword shall anticipate
the vengeance of the gibbet.'
The half-naked girl stood like a thing of
marble, the light raised in her uplifted arm.
Silently she gazed with her large eyes on
her brother and her betrothed.
That brother, a man of some thirty years,
whose pale and beardless face stood out
distinctly
from the long and flowing robe of his
order. There was a silent scorn about his
colorless lip; an agony of shame, in the
glance of his eyes, as they dilated in his
death-like
face.
By his side, his drawn sword grasped in a
firm hand, stood the soldier, quivering with
silent rage Clad in a green uniform,
spangled
with ornaments of every shape and device,
his w de trowsers glittering with gold lace, a
pistol in his belt, and his small eyes
twinkling
from a mass of dark hair and beard, he
presented an effective contrast to the pale
face and sombre attire of the monk.
`Brother,' replied the girl, in a tone that
was firm in its very tremulousness, `it is
false; there is no spy here. Yonder is my
bed-chamber, search it.'
Her red lip curled in quiet scorn, and with
her blood-stained arm she silently lifted her
loosened robe upon her bosom, blushing like
a beautiful sunset, in that action of maidenly
modesty.
`But we saw him enter;' vociferated the
soldier. `We traced him along the
corridor
aye,
to this very room! He is here and
his life is ours.'
You should have seen the girl turn the
silent
scorn of her large dark eyes upon his
face.
`It is Don Augustin, then, who enters like
a robber, at dead of night, the bed chamber of
his betrothed. My brother may hold himself
excused; he is but a monk, and knows but
little of the respect due a woman, a maiden.
But you, the soldier, the cavalier, the gallant.
O! chivalric Don Augustin.
Her lip curling, her head thrown back, she
flashed the light of her dark eyes upon his
lowering visage.
His head drooped, the point of his sword
touched the floor. The scorn of that
half-clad
and lonely maiden cut him to the very
quick.
Meanwhile the monk, with his arms folded,
his head sunken,regarded his sister with a
silent
look  long, searching, and full of
agony.
`We traced the spy to this apartment,' he
said in a voice that scarcely rose above a
whisper. `There is but one door, besides
this through which we have entered. The
other door is yonder, and it leads into your
bed chamber. Sister, we will reach that
room.'
What means that head turned hurriedly
over her shoulder, that glance toward the
distant door? Does the maiden fear the
search?
Her face was very pale, as she turned once
more, and with flashing eyes, besought her
brother `not to profane with his midnight
intrusion
the sanctity of her chamber and her
couch.'
The monk stood silent and confused
ashamed
to advance and unwilling to recede
but the tinselled Don Augustin sprang
forward
,
sword in hand, toward the door of her
bed-room.
With one sudden and impetuous bound,
that slender girl darted before him, and shield
ed the door with her outspread arms. She
shone very beautiful in the action. Again the
dark robe fell, and with the darker hair,
relieved
the soft loveliness of her virgin
breast.
`Back! It is not for
you
to enter here!'
And as the flash of her indignant eyes met
his cowering gaze, he started back, ashamed
of the meanness of his purpose.
`Brother advance! It is for you to commit
this outrage, alone.'
Slowly, ds though every step was clogged
with a leaden weight, the brother advanced
and laid his hands upon the dark panels of
the door.
`Why do you hesitate?' said the maiden,
as her bosom throbbed in long and deep
pulsations
.
`Are you afraid?'
Her words were brave, but pallor of her
face, the unnatural brightness of her eyes,
told the story of her intense agony.
It was a picture, to live upon the memory
forever.
The room so dark, and the dusks faces
frowning from the tapestried wall; these three
figures near the doorway,the maiden, with
her bared bosom and uplifted light, shining
down upon her pale face; the monk, with
one foot advanced, one hand laid upon the
panels; the soldier with his head bowed, his
sword lowered, gazing with upturned eyes
upon the sister and the brother, his chest
heaving with suspense.
The strong light upon these figures, and the
gloom all aroundit was a most impressive
scene; and a silence like the grave,
added
awe to that moment of anxious
hesitatation
.
`I will enter,' said the monk.
He pushed open the door and disappeared
at the same moment. The sister sank on her
knees, while a groan of intense agony
swelled
her bosom. Yes, with her hair, falling
over her face, she covered her eyes with one
hand, and the other, grasping the light
drooped
by her side.
Don Augustin, like a statue of surprise,
stood as if chained to the floor, gazing in
mute horror upon the kneeling woman. He
was a soldier, and had done brave work in
many a battle, done hideous butchery in many
a memorable Texan field; but now the damps
of fear started from his cold forehead. He
was afraid.
He listened to the sound of footsteps within
that chamber, he heard a deep-toned
ejaculation
,
and then all was dead silence. The
sword of Don Augustin shook as the tremor
of his arm agitated the gilded hilt.
`Thou art false, Isora!' he whispered, as
his parting lips disclosed his white teeth firmly
set together.
She did not raise her head. Cowering on
the floor, her robe, her hair, mingled in wild
disorder, she pressed her left hand against her
forehead and laid her head against the panels
of her chamber door.
And thus they kept their fearful watch;
the maiden and her plighted husband. She,
the orphan child of an honored race of old
Castile, now trembling in fear and shame, as
her brother searched her chamber. He, a
brave and cruel soldier, quivering in fear of
that dishonor which seemed glaring in his
face from the sombre panelling of the fatal
door.
Within the chamber!
We will follow the footsteps of the monk.
He entered, and the sanctity of his sister's
bed room lay open to his gaze. It was a cool
and quiet place, hung with faint crimson
curtains
,
a single window opening on a garden
to the north, a solitary light placed in a niche
before an image of the Virgin Mary. The
perfume
of flowers imparted a delicious
sweetness
to the sultry air. Beautiful in their
rainbow
hues, they were clustered in a vase near
the window. In one corner stood the maid's
couch, yet bearing the outlines of her shape
on its silken pillows.
The monk advancedtrembling he took
the light and searched the room. There was
no one there. All was silent and deserted.
That light fell over the bed, revealed the
folds of the silken hangings, the flowers by
the window, and the Virgin smiling from the
recess, but it did not disclose the form of a
living thing.
`The spy is not here!' he gasped, and
approached
the window. `He cannot have
escaped
in this way; the leap were certain
death!'
He looked down into the garden, where
flowers and shrubbery were grouped, in a
wilderness of perfume, and then, through the
interval of the vines which clustered round
the window frame, he saw the mild, sad light
of the stars.
`This is strange;' he murmured, as he
approached
the image of the Virgin. `As I live,
he entered this room, and yet I can discern no
trace of his footsteps.'
As he spoke, a dim, distant, murmuring
sound, like the tramp of ten thousand men on
a sandy shore, came through the thick walls
of that ancient mansion. The monk groaned
as he bit his lips in impotent rage.
`
They
come, the heretics, the invaders!'
But what is the sight that fixes the glance
of his burning eyes? The statue of the
Virgin
has been moved from its place in the
recess
:
the monk remembers the old-time
legends
of his paternal mansion, and at a glance
discovers the entrance to that secret
stairway
,
leading from the bed-chamber to the
roof.
`Ah!' he groaned, with an oath in pure
Castilian, `I have tracked the wolf to his
lair!'
It was the work of second to spring forward
through that holy image, open wide the
narrow
door and glide into the darkness of the
secret stairway.
Ten steps upwardsteps of stone, built in
the thickness of the wallsand he stood upon
the flat roof, amid the battlemented walls of
the mansion, with the light of the stars upon
his brow.
A hand was laid upon his arm; the stern,
stern gripe of these iron fingers forced an
involuntary
murmur of pain.
Fiercely the monk turned, his lip
compressed
,
his brow scowlingit was his impulse to
hurl the intruder from the roof.
But the scowl passed from his brow ere he
drew another breath. His lips parted, the
indignant
flash of his eye was succeeded by a
vacant stare.
He felt his blood curdle in his veins. For
there, in the pale light of the stars, rose a tall
form, swelled to gigantic proportions by the
gloom, and a voice low and deep, which
thrilled
to the inmost heart of the monk,
whisperee
these words,
`Remember the
Rancho Saldo
, and look
yonder!'
While that death-like clasp tightened on his
arm, the monk recognized the voice, and
trembled like a frightened child before the
spectre of some goblin story.
Quivering with a fear more terrible to
behold
because its source is unknown to us, the
monk beheld the sight which spread before
him.
It was a sight to swell the heart with a
vague yet overwhelming sense of the
sublime
.
Let us stand beside him on the roof of the
mansion which overlooks the main square of
the town, and gaze upon the vision which he
beheld and feel its dusk sublimity rush thro'
the eyesight to our souls.
CHAPTER VI.
THE LANDING AT VERA CRUZ.
`Winfield Scott in the footsteps of Cortes.'
Texan MSS
.
Above
, the sky of night, that dome of deep
and tranquil blue, shining with the gleam of
the stars. Beneath, the town of Vera Cruz,
its roofs and towers, rising indistinctly in the
gloom, with the Grand Plaza, right before us,
encircled by noble structures, and the sandy
shore, stretching as far as eye can see, to the
norte and south, in dreary barrenness.
Yonder, to the north-east, above the waves,
glooms the castle of San Juan de Ulloa; a
dark pile, rising sullenly into night, with the
Mexican flag, waving from its loftiest tower.
Toward the east the waves break in low
murmurs
against the barren isle of Sacrificios,
barren
to the sight, yet bearing in its bosom
mysterious
chambers, stored with relics of six
hundred years ago.
Beyond the Castle and the Fort spreads the
illimitable waste of the trackless gulf, a world
of waves, reaching out into the vague night
until it kisses the world of sky.
Landward we gaze: beyond the waste of
sand and the dark line of forest and hill, a
colossal mass, white as snow, towers serenely
into the western sky.
That white mass, rising in its lone
magnificence
from the distant horizon, its sublime
summit rushing proudly into heaven, is the
Peak of Orizaba; the altar of this glorious
temple which has the waste of sand and forest
and the sweep of the vast ocean, for its floor,
the sky for its dome, the stars of God for its
sacrificial lights.
It is one of those scenes which glide into
the soul and fill it with a sublimity that has no
speech. No word escapes our lips, no sudden
ejaculation give vent to our awe. Here we
gaze, the ocean is before us, the gloomy
castle
rising from its waves,there, and Orizaba
glares like the ghost of past ages from the
western sky.
For a moment we turn our gaze, from the
ocean and the mount, to the city that sleeps
before us, that home of plague, nestling on
the low and sandy shore, called Vera Cruz.
The mansion, on whose roof we stand, lies
east of the Plaza. Yonder, to the west, with
its front to the eastern sky, towers the
Cathedral
,
a noble structure, whose dome and cross
are lost to view in a vague mass of blackness.
What means this blackness that seems to
undulate
,
like a cloud as we gaze upon it? That
dome is black with vultureslook! Upon
the cross, rising high in the serene air,
crouches
the sentinel of the band; an omen of death
and blood, nestling upon the emblem of Jesus
and Peace!
He will have a brave feast ere many days,
that gory vulture, resting to-night on the
highest
Cross of Vera Cruz.
There, on the south of the square, rises
another
church, or mass of churches, swarming
with buzzards, black even to the cross, with
those birds of death.
Ere a month has passed, those churches
will be blasted into ruins; the bodies of the
dead will darken their altars; the vulture pick
his ghastly meal even in their most holy
places.
Before us, on the east of the square, we
behold
the National Palace, surmounted by the
tri-colored flag of Mexico.
And from this Plaza, shadowed in deep
night, by those noble forms of architectural
grandeur, extend the smooth-pebbled streets
of Vera Cruz, overhung with balconied
windows
,
gay with many-colored awnings, and
rendered uniform by a wide extent of level
roofs.
It is is indeed a beautiful town. Far out
on the sealike a gleam from Italy or Asia,
the voyager beholds it, with its towers and
cupolas, rising from the waste of sand; while
far above smiles the serene Orizaba. In the
calm evening hour when the white peak blushes
in the sun, and the smile of the dying day is
upon wave, castle and shore, these balconies
are crowded with beautiful women whose
white fingers gleam through the intervals of
flowers, while their gracefully gathered
mantle
cannot altogether hide the glance of their
dark eyes, the red warmth of their lips, the
the passionate heaving of their veiled
bosoms
.
And yet from this town, so sublime with
its distant Orizaba, so beautiful with its warm
southern women, its tropical flowers, so grand
with tower and dome, the Plague every year
hurls two thousand people to their graves.
One third of its houses are ravaged every
year by that pestilence, which wings its
dead-liest
dart where the verdure is freshest, the
sky most serene, the flowers most beautiful.
To-night another, a deadlier plague
threatens
Vera Cruz.
What mean these batteries erected
everywhere
about the city, hemming its houses in
a wall of latent flame? Wherever you gaze,
not an inch of ground beyond the walls of
the town but is commanded by some deadly
engine of war. To the North, you behold
Fort Conception, to the left Fort Santiago,
one mile from the city, with a belt of water
between, San Juan De Ulloa all formidable
with cannon, all prepared for the hurricane
of hattle.
What foreign enemy will dare assail the
impregnable castle, the city of the Gulf,
defended
by a wall of steel, by the invisible
barrier
of the Plague?
Hark! There is a strange sound to the
souththat waste of sand is black with
shadowy
formsthe tread of ten thousand men
fills the air with a sound like the first
moaning
of a thunder storm.
Gaze upon the channel which glides
between
the castle and the Isle of Sacrificios.
Even as the light breeze crisps the waters
into tiny ripples, we behold glooming through
the night the dark forms of ships of war,
some white with sails, some sending the
smoke of their steam-engines into the starlit
sky. The night is dark, we may not trace
distinctly the shapes of these vessels, nor
count their cannon, nor estimate the awful
power of their death machinery, but they are
there, gently undulating upon the smooth
waters
,
their decks black with warriors, the
banner
of the stars waving over all, as if to flash
back unto heaven the smile of the cloudless
sky.
What means the banner of the stars
floating
over the Gulf of Mexico?
Look! There are barges upon the waters,
gliding as noiselessly as any gondola of
Venice
,
that bears the lover to his mistress's smile,
gliding from the ships to the shore, and
bearing
armed men to the plague-smitten shore
of Vera Cruz.
Does not the scene rivet your gazefill
your heart.
You see those boats extended in the form
of a crescent, approach the sands, while the
water breaks in foam around their prows
the bayonets twinkle like fireffies through the
darkness, a vague murmur stealing over the
waves, swells along the shore like the hushed
whispers of ten thousand men!
They come on, those death-boats, bearing
many a true heart to the hideous grave of the
pestilence, they grate upon the pebbly beach,
there is a flag waving through the gloom, and
the forms of armed men start into view far
along that drear, that barren shore.
Where is now the thunder of San Juan de
Ulloa? Look!that slight elevation of sand
commands the shore, a single cannon planted
there would hurl a thousand men back into
the waves, and redden with blood the ripples
as they gurgled over these mangled `falls'?
Is there not one true-hearted Mexican,
only one, to place the cannon and fling the
lighted match to his fatal work? Not one?
For there is a doom upon the land, the
hardy
children of the North are here, the
soldiers
of the new crusade throng the waters
and the shore, at least twelve thousand strong,
and there is not one Mexican to meet them
on the beach with the warm welcome of a
warrior's steel.
At sunset you should have beheld the scene,
for if it is impressive now, at sunset it was
most beautiful!
It was a calm afternoon, on the ninth of
March, 1847. The glow of sunset was upon
the waveless waters of the Mexican Gulf,
upon the city of Vera Cruz, with its roofs
and towers, centred on the sandy shore, upon
the dark castle, glowing to the north, and
those beams so vivid in their tropical glare
hung in a baptism of life around the far-off
Peak of
Orizbaa
.
There, in that sweet, sad calm of the
evening breeze, which makes the stranger
in a foreign land dream of home, a strange
sight was seen by the light of the setting
sun.
The roofs of Vera Cruz were black with
people. The soldier sprung to the
battlement
and held his breath as he gazed. From
yonder castle the gay group of Mexican
generals looked forth upon the tranquil wa
ters. Every eye was centred upon the
channel
,
between the castle and sacrificios, and
every heart beat quicker at the splendid
panorama
,
warmed by the sunset rays.
For the huge Princeton came gliding over
the waves, urged swiftly on by her
tremendous
machinery, with the smoke curling over
her masts, and melting into the serene gold
of the upper sky. The dark form, the white
sails of the other vessels, swept black and
glittering in the centre. She seemed, that
fearful Princeton, renowned for the bloody
tragedy once enacted on her decks, like the
head of a huge serpent trailing its sinuous
way over the calm waters.
As the fleet approached the Isle of
Sacrificios
,
the armed men crowded on the decks,
their weapons flashing in back the glare of
the sun, cast their gaze to the west, and saw
the desolate shore spreading wide and dreary
as the waves broke over its sands. The city
crowded on its every roof with the men, the
women, the mothers and daughters of Vera
Cruz are therethe vessels of other nations
anchored in the harbor, their masts alive with
silent spectators, and in the distance
Orizaba
seemed to woo them on.
Orizaba
, that soon
would see them hurled by hundreds into the
plague-pit, or crushed in bloody heaps upon
the battle field!
In the shrouds of the steamer
Massachusetts
,
at this moment of intense expectation,
stands a man of some sixty years, his form
unbent from its stern majesty by the toil of
battle or the frost of age, clad in a costume
magnificent in its severe simplicity. Blue,
relieved by gold,a broad chest heaves
beneath
that uniform, a kingly form supports
that warrior head. His brow was bared: you
could see the gray hairs curling round it; the
sunset glow upon those firm features, every
line glowing with a warrior soul.
Over his head, and around him, throwing
his expressive form distinctly into view,
waves in slow undulations the banner of the
stars.
His eye brightening as it expands, roves
over the scene, and he remembers that bloody
field fought years ago, within the thunder of
Niarara, and looks forward with a quickening
pulse to these words, which history will soon
write in characters of light`
Winfield
Scott, in the footsteps of Cortes
!'
With twelve thousand men, their lives,
their honor, hanging on his fiat, this man of
Niagara sees the American army approach
the land of Mexico
Hark!the thunder of a signal cannon
breaks the silence, a volume of blue cloud
sweeps over the form of Scott.
That is the signal gun!
And parting from the vessels' sides, as they
swing at anchor near the Isle, a line of barges,
crowded with soldiers, sweep toward the shore.
It is a beautiful thing to see them come
spread forth in the form of a crescent, which
flings the glitter of four thousand bayonets
over the waves.
On towards the sandsnearer and nearer
in sight of the city and the fort, the object
of the gaze of thousands, these veterans of
Monterey, these men of Louisiana and
Kentucy
,
approach the hostile shore.
That form, standing erect in the foremost
barge, with the light playing upon the
muscular
chest; the uniform of blue glittering with
gold, the deep eye, gleaming beneath the
waving plumes, as white as snow?
Over all he towers; the American Flag
grasped in one hand, the unsheathed sword
flashing in the other. Behind him, the fleet;
before him, the shore; far above, the white
altar, Orizaba.
Look upon that banner and read in its
blood-stained folds the single word, `
Monterey
!'
Gaze upon that waving plume; it
gleamed like a beacon through the three days
fight of the Mountain City; it waves above
the brow of
Worth
, whose eye flashes again
as he prepares to spring from the barge, and
plant the banner upon the sands of Mexico.
Silence reign, only broken by the sweep of
the oars; now hearts are beating impetuously
beneath their warrior covering; the setting
sun shines over compressed lips and woven
brows. A moment of fearful suspense!
Nearer to the shore glides the toremost
barge.
You see Worth lift at once his sword and
banner; with one hurried glance he surveys
the hostile beachthe city five miles distant,
the harbor white with sails; and then casting
his face, so chivalric in its ripe manhood, to
the glow of the setting sun, he springs upon
the shore.
In silence he plants the banner staff upon
the sands and uncovers his brow.
Ten thousand eyes behold the picture.
That solitary soldier, standing alone upon
the beach, the waves curling at his feet, the
Banner of the Continent waving over his head.
The golden sands relieve his form, the evening
breeze lifts the banner into light.
Then, and not till then, the ominous silence
is broken by a thunder shout. It is the
heart-warm
cheer of our thousand brave men. Look
upon them as they come! With one impulse
they plunge into the waves and dash onward,
lifting their glittering arms into the light,
they cannot wait until the barges grate the
sand, but springing into the water, mid-breast
deep, they hurry forward, and encircle with
a guard of hearts and steel, the noble form of
Worth.
The last gleam of the setting sun disclosed
that barren shore, clouded by the firm array
of six thousand men, with the gloomy
outlines
of cannon and mortar, seen disitnctly
even amid the flash of these long belts of
dazzling
steel.
Darkness gathers on the ocean and the
shore; one by one the prominent points of
the picture went out in the gloom. First, the
shore faded; and the soldiers, in their
beautiful
array, became a vague mass of moving
blackness, their presence known by their
thunder tread alone. The domes of the city
glittered for a moment and then were dark;
the huge castle sank into the bosom of night
the ocean reached forth its waves and melted
through the dusky air into the distant
horizon
.
And when the shadow was upon the ocean
and the shore, like a mantle of tangible
darkness
,
still, in the west, Orizaba lifted its white
altar into heaven, and while all was black
below
,
the last rays of the departing day hung
round its glossy pinnacle like a smile from
God.
Now it is dark night, illumined only by the
stars. While the American legions are
hurrying
from the battle ships to the shore, and
extending in silent and terrible arry around
the slumbering city, our souls are hurried by
the stern emotions of the hour, back into the
bosom of the Dead Ages.
Three hundred years ago, and the same
lone Orizaba, that towers serenely now,
flashing its calm scorn upon the petty broils
of man, smiling calmly on, whether he
marches to battle in glittering array, or sinks
disfigured and horrible, into the loathsome pit
of the plaguethat same Grizaba beheld a
far different scene.
Then, the great woods sent forth their arms
of foliage and flowers even to the ocean shore.
The palm grew near the waters, a straight
column, towering into upper air, with a
coronal
of broad leaves and luscious fruit around
its brow. The cypress, too, that stern
monarch
of dead centuries, rose here, with all
manner of rainbow flowers, blooming round
its massive trunk, and vines of various beauty
hanging about its branches. Then, the desert
sand, where San Juan de Ulloa glooms, was a
fair green isle. Sacrificios yonder, was the
Temple Isle of a strange and mysterious
religion
.
Upon its sands, among the gay glory
of the tropical vegetation, the horrible altars
rose, dripping with the warm blood of the
human
sacrifice. Beneath its surface were
chambers reared in the barbarous yet im
pressive architecture of the people, whose
name has for thousands of years been lost to
human lips.
Wonderful chambers were those, hidden
beneath the sand, gloomy with images of the
devil, God; and burrowing far into the caverns
beneath the ocean waves.
Then, it is of the time, three hundred years
ago we speak: a wondrous people dwelt in
this land, amid gorgeous cities, or in the
silence
of the beautiful vallies, their dusky
faces, glowing with the same passions that fill
our bosoms now, the fury of war, the
avaricious
lust of traffic, the magnetic tenderness
of love.
Yes, beside this shore many a great lord,
clad in garments that were woven with
feathers
of rainbow dyes, and dazzling with
ornaments
of solid gold, strode proudly along,
followed by the innumerable column of his
half-naked and dusky warriors. Yes, beneath
yonder cypress, in those days that are now
almost forgotten, crouched the dark-cheeked
but impetuous daughter of the South, looking
with her large deep eyes upon the brown
child that slept upon her bosom. Yes, upon
yonder isle the chaunt of prayer was heard,
the altar smoke arose, the yell of the victim
forced to the altar, his heart torn from his
living bodyshrieked in horrible cadence
upon the still air, and died far along upon
the waves.
The ruler of this land dwelt in a valley,
some hundred of miles to the west, in a
tranquil
valley of blossoms, whose gardens and
lakes were guarded by volcanic mountains.
At once the High Priest of the awful
religion
and the Emperor of the people, he was
called the `Sad Warrior,' or in the Aztec
language,
Montezuma
.
Wherefore called the Sad or Doomed
Warrior
?
It is a strange story, and I will speak
it in few words.
The religion of this vast people, which
raised its altars in every city, and sent its
sacrificial flames into the sky, from every
mountain, comprised the worship of two
deities
.
Like all the religions, or rather forms of religion in the world, it adored two gods,a
God of Blood, a God of Peace.
The God of Blood, in some lands,
demanded
the offerings of an lnquisition, pledged to
do the works of hell on earth, on the victims
of persesution, slain without mercy on the
battle fields of bigotry.
In Mexico, this God of Blood demanded
merely the palpitating heart of a solitary
victim
,
who was stretched upon the altar stone,
amid the gaze of thousands, and torn to death
with his livid brow crowned with blossoms.
This victim was slain on stated occasions of
solemn ceremonial, not in the gloomy hall of
an inquisition's dungeon, nor in the
Molock-sacrifice
of a Genevan stake.
In all lands of the world, the God of Peace
received the worship of the purest hearts.
The brutal man, swayed by the bigot's lust,
into hellish frenzy, loved Him not. But his
name was written in serene skies, in
waveless
lakes, in all that was tender and beautiful
in the world, as much in the bared beauty of
a stainless woman's bosom as in the lone
majesty
of the mountain top, smiling in the last
gleam of an unclouded sun.
After ages of darkness, this God was
clearly
written in the BibleHe shone an image
of Time joined to Eternity, in the serene
Jesus
.
In the land of Mexico, three hundred years
ago, this Godonly revealed to the Aztec
people in the language of external nature, or
the voiceless eloquence of the heartwas
seen in the blossoms, in the cloudless skies,
in all the tenderness and sanctity that
whispers
in the syllable
Home
.
It their traditions, which called him
Quet-zalcoatt
,
it was taught that he had lived in
the Mexican land, some thousand years
before
;
that He had been banished, in his
golden reign of peace, and driven from this
very shore by the God of Blood.
But a glorious hope lived in their traditions
that he would return and bless the land again,
nnd reign the Messiah of the Heart.
In this hope lived Montezuma; but priest
and king as he was, of a despotic government
and a barbarous religion, the hope soon
became
to him a nightmare fear; he looked for
the return of the good God with trembling,
and saw the coming of the blessed age, with
the terror of self-convicted guilt.
He was doomed to destruction from his
birth, by Prophecy, and the coming of the
blessed Quet-zalcoatt was to ripen his doom
into judgement. Therefore, from his birth,
he was called Montezuma, or the Doomed
Man.
Did the Messiah come?
Yes, but not the God Peace, nor the apostle
of the God of Peace, but a stern Messiah,
whose crucifix was the hilt of his sword,
whose black banner bore a red csoss, with
the words,`
In this sign we conquer.
'
A single picture from the life of this
Messiah
of Blood.
CHAPTER VII.
THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO.
`In order to estimate the present we must
look upon the past. `I will tell you,' said
the veteran, `a story of the days of old, in
order that you may understand that which
I have to state of,the ninth of March,
1847.
Texan MSS
.
Upon
the sandy shore a white tent arose,
shadowed by the deep-green leaves of a
cypress
tree.
Around that tent were grouped a band of
warriors attired in linked steel, their
bearded
faces surmounted by iron helmets, an iron
sword in each sinewy hand. A deep murmur
thrilled through the group, and the last gleam
of the fading light revealed the various
passions
,anger,
despair, hopecontending for
the mastery in every warrior's face.
While they surrounded the tent, flinging
their mailed hands in fierce gesticulations, in
the air, the light of sunset mellowed the
waveless
ocean, and the waters melted without a
sound upon the pebbled shore.
Around was the glowing panorama of fruit
and flowers: from the thickly clustered
foliage
the purple grape, the fragrant fig, the
golden orange, were seen, while over all
arose the melancholy palm, so lone in its
majesty
;
the strong cypress, so big, in every
inch of its rugged bark, with the history of
ast years.
And over all, far away to the west, the
cloudless blue of the evening sky was
broken
by a colossal mass, white as sunless
snow.
It was a wild and yet a beautiful scene.
That group of warriors, beared from the
mouth to the throat, and clad in mail of iron,
clustered about the white tent, their
warhorses
,
also iron-clad, standing near; the
golded sand stretching far to the north and
south; to the east, the ocean, vast, calm and
trackless; in the west, the serene peak of
Orizaba.
Attracted by the sound of those earnest
voices, speaking deeply, in pure Castilian,
we enter the group and start back, wondering
and dumb, as we behold the two figures that
form the centre of the circle.
A man of thirty-three years, clad in
glittering
steel armor, his form at once agile
and athletic, is seated there, upon a rock; his
helmet laid aside, his hands clasping that
sword whose hilt pierces the sand.
A face, high and bold in the forehead,
thoughtful, almost sad, with the light of those
eyes, so unnaturally large and dark,; firm in
the silent compression of the bearded lip
altogether the face of an enthusiast and a
warrior. Were it not for the air of practical
energy which invests the face we should say,
at the first glance, that we beheld in that
mail-clad man, a dreamer, cased in armor
instead
of a cowl.
While all are moved by the tempest of
passion
,
he alone is calm. Yes, while the monk
at the right surveys the group, and clasps his
crucifix in prayer, while the splendid warrior
on the left, whose battle-steel shines with
drops of gold, seizes his sword, and with a
scornful lip, confronts the group, this man,
with the uncovered brow, is firm and colds a
marble.
`The ships which bore us to this accursed
land,
you
have destroyed!' shouted an
athletic
man, whose dogged features, half-hidden
in his hair and beard, announce a reckless
nature. `By the Holy Trinity, we are here
in a heathen land, at the mercy of the savages
our bones will bleach upon their altars
before
many days!'
And a chorus of fierce ejaculations
disturbs
the silence of the evening hour.
`Pity us, Mother of God! We shall never
see Castile again.'
`Never! Our ships, torn to pieces, rot
beneath yonder wave; the madness of this
man hath undone us all.'
`Conquer a nation like this, a nation of
millions, ruled by a great king! It is madness
to think it.'
The man with the uncovered brow heard
it all, with his large eyes fixed upon the sand.
Not a word passed his lips.
`Back!' shouted the splendid knight, who
with drawd sword stood by him; `dare you
menace the captain?'
`For the love of God, my children, be calm,'
besought the priest, lifting into light the holy
Cross.
By this time you have doubtless
discovered
that the name of the priest was
Olmedo
,
the splendid knight,
Alvarado;
these
mailed forms, the adventurous Spaniards, who
landed a few days since on this unknown
shore; the central figure, so calm, while all
around is storm,
Hernan Cortes
.
He has destroyed their ships. They cannot
go backthe ocean is between them and
home; before them the wonderous land of
Montezuma, swarming with its millions of
people, and glorious with its unmeasured
stores of gold. This man, Cortes, not long
ago an obscure planter of Cuba, has sworn
with this little band to conquer the empire of
Montezuma!
It is indeed madness.
At last he lifts his eyes and surveys the
angry
group. You see the madness of his
dream in the deep flush which reddens his
cheek, in the unnatural glare of his eye.
That flush, that glare, says more to the
warriors
than a thousand words, for they tell us
that the soul of this man is up within him,
that alone he will accomplish this deed, if
not a single arm moves with him.
He rises, lays his left hand upon the banner
staffabove him the Gonfalon of black
velvet
,
with its red cross; and with his right he
raises the blade or his sword slowly over his
head.
`Be it so!' his deep, indignant voice is
heard exclaim. `You all desert me. I will
go alone.'
Silence! The genius flashing from this
man's eyes begins its work upon every heart.
Silence, hesitation, suspense!
`There is a land to conquerit is yonder!'
he pointed to the setting sun`there is
gold to winit is there. There are millions
of heathen, whom we can convert to the true
cross; they, too, are there. You are afraid
to conquer, convert, or winafraid!you
desert me. It is a crime that I have
destroyed
your ships. I am guilty; I confess it.
Take your way where you will; as for me,
with this sword in my hand, this banner over
my head, I will cry to God and his saints and
go forth to conquer, alone!'
The silence deepens, heads are drooped,
upraised arms sink with their swords; with
wondering eyes they gaze upon the form of
Cortes.
Alvardo, so splendid in his knightly array,
advances silently to his side,
`Not
alone!
for I am with you.'
`And I!' exclaims the priest Olmed,
advancing
from the other side.
`And I!' exclaims a soft, low, musical
voice in Castilian, broken by a strange
accent
it echoes from the tent and pierces
every heart.
Two white arms are wound around the
neck of Cortes; and pillowed on his right
shoulder is seen a warm face, framed in
flowing
hair, and lighted by large eyes that burn
with the religion, the love of a true woman.
Who is this beautiful woman, from whose
brown cheeks glows the ripeness of fiery
blood? So queenly is her form, so
voluptuous
in every out lineher young limbs
trembling
beneath a robe of spotless whiteso
like a passionate woman in her ripe lips, so
like a spirit in her large, eloquent eyes?
Every Spaniard knows her at a glance. The
child of the heathen people, he has forsaken
home and altar for the Christian; she has
linked her fate with Cortes, saying to him in
the beautiful language of the Hebrew maiden
to Naomi,`wherever thou goest, I will go;
thy people shall be my peoplethy God my
God!'
Now spreading forth her arms she looks
upon the stern soldiers, with that glance, so
sublime with woman's faith, and utters the
broken words,
`I, too, will go!'
Had you turned your eyes for a moment
from this group and then looked again, you
would have seen the sand crowded qy
kneeling
men, their eyes gleaming with the frenzy
of enthnsiasm, their swords lifted towards the
holy banner, their voices joining in the shout
`Mexico and Montezumal Lead us on
we will conquer with you Cortes, or with you,
Cortes, we will die!'
Orizaba glowed in the setting sun, and the
Indian maiden, Mariana, held over the dark
hair of Cortes a crown of orange blossoms,
with a single blood-red flower in the centre.
As the night sank over the scene, she
fluttered
it gently in the air, and it sank, like a good
omen on his brow.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE AVENGER OF A THREE-FOLD WRONG.
Whenever he tried to pray, one word,
written
in letters of fire, glared between him
and God
Remorse
.'
Texam MSS.
Remember
the
Rancho Salado
and look
yonder!'
That voice, we say, curdled the blood of
the monk.
There, beside him, on the roof-top of the
old mansion of Vera Cruz, rose a sombre
figure, which, in the dim light of the stars,
resembled a phantom rather than a man.
It was some moments ere the monk could
gather nerve to raise his eyes and look upon
the shadowy form. At first he saw only a
tall figure, attired in grey, with a rifle in his
hand, a pale face, encircled by masses of
dark hair, with a long black beard clothing
the lower part of the visage, and descending
to the broad chest.
Then, as he saw more clearly, he beheld
that white forehead, the dark eyebrows, the
aquiline nose, firm mouthcurving with a
smile that was almost Satanticand a
rounded
chin, appearing from masses of black
beard. A frock coat of grey hues, edged on
the skirts with dark fur, and girded by a belt
of black leather, displayed the sinewy
proportions
of the stranger. Over his white brow
arose a cap of dark fur, with a single
long and slender feather, quivering in its
front.
`You tremble,
Father Pedro
,'the voice
sounded like a death-knell to the monk
`and yet there is no reason to fear! Come,
while the stars gleam above us, while San
Juan frowns yonder, and the tramp of ten
thousand heretics resound from the sandy
beach. Come, I say, sit by me on the
battlements
,
and let me tell you a storyan
amusing
story, as there is a God! Do not wonder
that I speak Spanish with such a glib tongue
I learned the language in an excellent
grammar schoolrather rough it may be,
but still excellentthe castle-prison of
Perote
!'
Father Pedro sank backward on the
battlement
,
his hands hanging motionless by his
side. He trembled as with an ague chill
but then the air was so cold.
Taking his seat beside the monk, and
resting
one arm on his rifle, the stranger began
his story,
`Did you ever, Father Pedro, in your
priestly wanderings, behold a picture like
this? A lonely rancho, centered in a valley
of barren hills, and illumined on every stone
with the dusky glow of a clouded sunset? In
the courtyard of that rancho a handsome
soldier
,
standing on a log, shrieks to his
blood-hounds
,
and bids them put to death seventeen
men, rebel Texans, who await their fate near
the walla boy, mark ye, a smooth-faced,
girlish boy, standing in their midst? There
is a crash, father Pedro, a smoke, and
horrible
groans, rise from that heap of palpitating
forms, which writhe, struggle and die, even
on the spot where a moment since, stood
seventeen living men. Not a Mexican eye
but is wet with tears, not a soldier but pities
the miserable men, who are butchered thus
in cold blood. Yes; there is one! Cold,
relentless, unpitying, while all are weeping
round him, stands that handsome officer, Don
Antonio Marin!'
The Monk shuddered.
`But near the gallant officer is seen the
brother of the smooth-cheeked boy, waiting
until the smoke clears away, so that he may
recognize the mangled form of Harry
Grywin
.
That brother is a strong man, Father
Pedro, yet he bites his lip until the blood
comesweeps! O, every one of his tears is
worth a Mexican's life; and all the while the
handsome officer stands smiling at his agony.
Come, man, you are dullwhy don't you
laugh? When the smoke clears away, John
the elder brother advances, searches for his
girlish brother's body There are sixteen
carcasses on the sod, but Harry's is not
there!'
You may see the head of the Monk fall
slowly on his breast.
`The scene changes to Saltillo, a beautiful
city, some hundred miles and more from the
Rancho Salado. Two months have clapsed
since the handsome officer halloed his
blood-hounds
to the slaughter. It is a festival day in
Saltillo, the Church lines the street with her
banners, her crosses, her glittering robes,
extending
in gorgeous procession. Above all,
above the points of encircling bayonets, shines
the Host` the body and blood of Jesus'
shrined in a golden cup. But who comes
here, along the streetsthis ghastly figure
clad in rags, the face thinned by famine, the
blue eyes hollow and ghastly? It is a Texan,
aye the very boy who, two months since was
doomed, shot, in the Rancho Salado, he
escaped
,
wandered among the mountains for
two months, and now rushes into the ranks
of the procession, screaming for bread! for
water! For you see, he is maddened by
thirst and hunger! Like a hunted deer, that
can drag its bloody trail no longer he turns to
his hunters and beseeches mercy! Bread!
water! Behold the mercy which is given to
him. A file of soldiers separate from the
procession, at the command of their leader.
A ghastly figure is kneeling in the centre of
the Plaza, the Cathedral before him, the host
gleaming above his head. `Present!fire!'
There is a quivering mass of flesh and blood
on the stones of the street, and the officer
advances
,
contemplates the form of his victim,
or, to put it in plainer words, Don Antonio
Marin looks quietly, and with his most
winning
smile, upon the mangled corse of that
boy of sixteen, girlish Harry Grywin.'
The monk lifted his eyes and muttered the
name of the Holy Trinity.
The voice of the stranger echoes clear and
deep through the silence of the night,it
pierces the soul of Father Pedro, yet he dare
not gaze upon the eyes nor look upon the face
of the unknown man. Unknown?
`Look yonder, monk.'
So careless, so conversational was the tone
of the stranger's voice, that the monk raised
his eyes.
`Yonder, Father Pedro! Not upon the
star-lit sky, nor upon the dreary shore of sand
not yet the wooded hills; but yonder, to
the north west. What is this that we behold?
A Texan home. Reared on an island knoll,
some sixty miles from San Antonio, amid a
grove of oaks, venerable with their waving
festoons of silver moss. Is it not beautiful?
The fountain bubbling in the centre of the
grove, the rich masses of sua and shade
chasing
each other over the sod, the world of
prairie and sky, spreading around and above
that home of Prairie Eden. A father and his
three children dwell there, in the wilderness,
the free canopy of God above them, and the
breath of God hlowing freshly over the
prairie
,
into their dear home of the blossoming
desert. But mark ye, Father Pedro, the
brothers
are called away to San Antonio, called,
with the laborers and slaves of the plantation,
to defend the frontiers of Texas from Mexican
outrage. They are gone only a few brief
hours; warned by a supernatural messenger
they leave their men encamped and hasten
home. They do return homebehold them,
after journeying all night, approach the island
grave, in the dimness of the daybreak. John
is mounted on his black horse, Harry on his
ambling bay; and you'll remember John was
a muscular man, sure as Death with his rifle;
and Harry a mere boy, with such laughing
blue eyes that went right into his rude
brother's
heart.
`They are coming homealone!for they
have left their soldiers on the prairie, thirty
miles away. They are in sight of Prairie
Eden. Their horses have fallen, but still they
hurry on. How beautifully the morning sun
shines over the mansion, with the oaks
grouped
around it, and the white moss quivering in
every breath of air. Coming Home! They
hear the sound of the fountain, see the porch,
ascend the knoll with a merry hurrah; for
John begins to think that his presentiment
was falsethe words of that awful messenger
a lie! But what is the sight that meets their
eyes as they reach the porch? Where is the
father to welcome the children home, where
the sister to press her kiss upon her brothers'
lips? Look!ha! ha! the father hangs to
the tree before his own door, his dead face
gilded by the morning sunthe sister
crouched
in the porch, a mad, a
dishonored
woman
!
'
The monk fell on his knees,`Mercy!
for the sake of the Holy Trinity! No more,
no more!'
`But the brother, even John, bends over his
lost sister. `His name?the author of this
double wrong, the doer of this devil's work?'
Hark! that voice from the white lips of the
wrecked woman,`
Don Antonio Marin!
As he hissed the last words through his
compressed teeththe monk crouching all the
while before himthe stranger dashed his
rifle on the flat roof and beat his forehead
with his clenched hands. The groan which
came from his lips was not human; it
resemled
the howls of a dying tiger.
`You will confess, Father Pedro, that John
Grywin and Don Antonio Marin have a long
account to settle whenever they may chance
to meet. You admit that even if John should
discover Don Antonio under the cowl of a
monk, his chivalric name, transformed into
`Father Pedro,' that it would be a very
amuing
thing for the said John to stab the good
father at dead of night, and pitch his bloody
carcass over the battlements into the streets of
Vera Cruz. This would be amusing, I say,
but very, very far from just. Let me picture
a little piece of justice for you. After the
lapse of long years, John Grywin finds Don
Antonio under the cowl of a monk, his only
care, the charge of a beautiful and orphaned
sister. Tho monk loves that sister. adores
her, even as John adored his sister. Yes, the
monk wishes her to marry the chivalric Don
Augustin, bestow her wealth on a
convent
,
and live happily for long years,
encircled
by blooming children. At this crisis of
her destiny, John Grywin comes to Vera
Cruz, finds entrance into the home of the
sister
,
and night after night, setting by her side,
with her soft hands within his own, tells her
the movingsomewhat melancholystory of
his life, and wins her heart forever. In this
story, mark you, he leaves the names a blank
does not tell the voluptuous Isora, that the
name of the assassin and ravisher is Don
Antonio
Marin. Well, after all his plans are
laid, John Grywin, being still in pursuit of
justice, brings the threads of destiny together
on the night of the 9th of March, 1817. Look
yonder, Father Pedro! Behold the barren
isle of Sacrificios! There, is the sepulchres
of the Aztec race, my bridal bed is waiting
for me now. Your sister is pure at this hour
when morning dawns she will repose in my
arms, in yonder bridal bed, sacrificedher
honor, purity, all, offered up to the memory of
my sister! Come, Monk, unfrock yourself;
I want your cowl. It will serve me as a
disguise
to pass the guard or stayha! ha!
Isora shall wear the monkish gown, and I
will assume the handsome uniform of Don
Augustin.'
The monk, Father Pedro, otherwise called
Don Antonio Marin, lay prostrate on the roof
prostrate and helpless, as though a palsy
had possessed his once vigorous limbs. His
eyes were rivetted on the face of the stranger.
He suffered him to strip the gown from his
form, saw him wind it about his form, and for
a moment all was silence.
Slowly, heavily the monk raised himself
into a sitting posture. The form of the
stranger
was half lost to view in the aperture of
the stairway leading from the roof to the room
of Isora.
That face, framed in its dark hair and long
beard, glared from its large eyes full in the
face of the Monk.
`One word before we part! Your turn
will come; it is not yet time. Do you
remember
walking some three months since, just
before you assumed the cowl, in the Alameda
of Mexico, your while-haired father on your
arm? It was a beautiful evening; the valley
of Mexico glowed with its groves and spires
in living light, while far above rose the
volcanic
mountains, sending their smoke, like
incense-clouds
into the evening sky. And you,
with your white-haired father, were walking
amid the blaze of rank and beauty which
floated along the Alameda of the gay city.
A bullet from an unknown source, pierced
your father's brain. He fell at your feet, his
white hairs bathed in blood. Whence came
that bullet? You never could guess; in
remorse
for your crimes, you deemed a
vengeance
dealt by a supernatural hands, and
immediately
assumed the cowl, Ha! ha! it is
indeed amusing!that bullet came from the
rifle of the escaped prisoner, John
Grywin
!'
`Oh God! my poor father!'
`Thus, one by one, I will sweep your
family
down to death. First your father falls;
to-night Isora sinks in the embrace of
pollution
!
Last of all your turn will come, yours,
Father Pedro, otherwise called Don Antonio
Marin, hero of the Rancho Salado; hero of
the Mass at Saltillo; hero of Prairie Eden.'
He was gone.
It was some moments before the monk
recovered
his consciousness, He tottered to his
feet, and the mild light of the stars shone over
his shaven face and revealed his broad
forehead
and wildly-glaring eyes; there was a
damp like death upon his brow; he wiped it
away with his chilled hands; but the cold
dross started forth again and bathed his
clammy
flesh.
Then gazing toward the ocean, Don
Antonio
contemplated, with a shudder, the dark
history of his life.
`I thought it was but revenge when I
dishonored
Isabel and slew her brotherrevenge
for the scorn which the proud girl flung in my
teeth long years ago, in her Philadelphian
home! But now, my father murdered, my
sister on the verge of dishonorI learn at
last, that the devil who urged me to my
revenge
,
brings home to me the poison which I
distilled for others! My sister, she is pure,
what harm has she done?'
But Isabel? Ho, ho! Sir Monk, thou hast
forgotten the beautiful and sinless girl of the
prairie?
`I will save her! So aid me God and all
his saints!'
With that trembling vow upon his lips, he
rushed down the stairway, and found himself
in the darkness of Isora's chamber.
The door, he tried it, with the nervous
force of despair, but it is fastened, and the
echo of voices came through its thick
panels
!
He listened!the voice of Isora, Don
Augustin and the Avenger, mingling in
chorus
.
Again the monk, driven to frenzy, tried
the door, but his attempt was hopeless. He
sank back upon the bed of Isora, and a hand,
cold, clammy, was laid upon his own,
thrilling
his veins, as with the touch of the dead.
`Fear not, Don Antonie,' said a soft, mild
voice, `for I, Isabel, of Prairie Eden am with
you!'
CHAPTER IX.
THE THREADS OF DESTINY.
`It matters not how brave, how ferocious the
criminal may be when in the act of his
crime, let but Destiny weave its tnreads
about him and the hero of vengeance came
and lo! your criminal is but a child in
strength and an ldiot in intellect.
Texan MSS
.
At
the same moment, on the opposite side of
the door, in the gloomy chamber, frowning
with the portaits of Castilian hidalgos, Don
Augustin maddened by blind rage, stood
prepared
to plunge his sword into the heart of
his unknown enemy.
That enemy stood near the door, his arms
folded over his rifle, while a smile of cold
contempt played over his lips.
Kneeling by his side, the light held in her
extended armit seemed frozen into marble,
lsora wound the dark robe around her breast,
and looked with vacant terror into the face of
her betrothed husband. Her bosom now
stilled like death, now heaving suddenly
under
the dark robe, her rich olive chek,
chilled
into a dull, lifeless hue, her eyes
gleamng
a light at once vivid and unnaturalall
betokened the violence of the emotions which
threatened her reason with utter
annihilation
.
Indeed she seemed sinking fast into a
stupor
,
a dull apathy worse than death.
Calm and sneering, John Grywinhis cold
smile rendered sinister, aye, Satanic, by the
upward direction of the lightlooked into the
face of Don Augustin, as though he would
read his soul, through his small and restless
eyes.
`Heretic! never do you leave this room
alive! Yon have poisoned the mind of this
pure lady
pure!
ha! ha! He laughed
bitterly
.
`You have outraged the honor of a
Mexican. Come,I am hungry for your
blood!'
`You talk like a hero! Bravo! I really
begin to admire you, Don Augustin.'
Such was the reply of John Grywin, de
livered in a quiet tone, his arms still folded
about his rifle, Not a muscle of his face
movednot one sign of agitation was visible
in his tall form or bold, white forehead.
`Dog! coward! I spit on you!'
Don Augustin grew grotesquely eloquent.
`I say you are afraid to measure swords
with me! I call you poltroom!and scorn
you.'
`You are ungentlemanly, Don Augustin,'
quietly remarked the Texan. `Now I have
but one word to say, and that is to request the
loan of your coat for a few hours. I wish to
pass the guard at the Mole, and to pass in
your uniform; you understand? Will you
strip?'
There was a sneering consciousness of
superior
power, not only physical but
intellectual
force, in his look and tone, and yet Don
Augustin was not a man at all to be
despised
.
With an impetuous bound he hurled the
point of his sword at the unprotected beast of
the Texan.
It was a deadly lunge, a moment of
quivering
suspense.
Then occurred a sudden and sublime
sacrifice
.
This woman, Isora, kneeling on the floor,
the light extended in her palsied hand, was
only clad in the solitary robe which trembled
on her heart. Yet she did not remember
this nor call to mind that modesty which is the
most sudden instinct of a pure woman.
There was a wilder instinct in her breast;
call it fascination, magnetism, love; and it
taught her that the sharp point was hurled
against the Texan's heart, that she must save
him at every hazard.
Quick as the tigress, maddened by the
slaughter of her young, she darted from the
floor, raised the light in one hand, and with
the other flung the robe from her breast and
hurled it upon the point of Don Augustin's
sword.
Then panting and glowingher form brave
as the form of sinless Eve, she flung back her
head, and with the eye flashing, the nostril
quivering, she entangled the sword, and with
a sudden movement, hurled it and her robe
together, on the floor.
The light was still in her uplifted left arm,
and in its beams she stood revealed, glowing
from head to foot, on bosom, cheek and brow,
with the fiery impulse of that heroic deed.
Don Augustin started back and shrieked
her name, coupled with a word too foul for
manhood to repeat.
Maddened as the Texan was by the wrongs
which had goaded him for years, until his
very life became one brooding revenge he felt
his blood boil at that unmanly word. Look!
You see his clubbed rifle circle his head, you
see Don Augustin hurled senseless to the
floor.
Then the beautiful girl, roused once more
into her woman's modesty as the impulse of
her action passed away, blushed in every
pore, tossed her dark hair on her form; it fell
it waved, it streamed over her bosom and
down her limbs, and sinking on her knees
wept aloud.
Methinks I see some sensualist of the
Pulpit
or the press read this passage, and as his
foul imagination, ineapable of anything but
that which is born of the kennel of his own
heart, covers this heroic deed with the
atmosphere
of his sensualism, and gravely groans
`Immoral! Damnable!'
I write this scene, first of all because it is
true, and next, as a defiance to those poor
earth worms, who crawl over all that is pure
and beautiful in the earth of God, leaving
their slime wherever they writhe along.
I paint this woman, with the bared form,
and look upon her unveiled loveliness,
blooming
in such roseate hues, flowing in such
waving
outlines, as a type of all that is pure in
the wide earth, an incarnation of that love
which hallows a man's soul, when he thinks
of a mother or a sister, a love stainless as the
snow-flake trembling from the parent cloud,
and bathed as its floats in the ray of a setting
sun.
But the sensualist, whether he whines in the
pulpit, or croaks in the press, or howls in the
brothel, what message has the statue or the
picture, or the wood-painting, which embodies
a woman's unveiled form, what message has
this purity enshrined for him? Nothing but
earth, for he is of the earth, earthy; nothing
but filth, for he is born of filthy; nothing
but lust, for the impulses of his heart are like
the bubble on the Dead Sea, stagnant and
pestilent excretions fomenting on the very
dregs of rottenness and decay.
Such a sensualist have I seen, talk with
prim utterance, in his demure journal, about
immoral books; quoting garbled passages to
prove his point, claiming sympathy from the
moral
public, because he had slimed over
some sentence or chapter that was pure
before
he touched it; and all the while the
victim
of this
chaste
editor's perjurya
brokenhearted
and wronged woman, lay mad and
howling in the cell of an insane hospital.
This was a moral editor of a Moral
Newspaper
.
An expression of mingled character passed
over the Texan's face, as he gazed upon the
kneeling girl. His large eye dilated, and
flashed with unusual light, while a smile
played
over his lip. Veiled in her luxuriant hair,
the snowy skin gleaming through the interval
of her tresses, she still grasped the light, as
her tears fell like rain on the half-revealed
bosom.
`Come, Isora,' said John of Prairie Eden
and believe me, his voice was low and
deep, and thrilling with that music of
passion
which always steals to the heart, and
makes it beat more tumultuously,`we must
away! Assume this monkish gown and
wind the dark robe over it, while I put on the
handsome dress of Don Augustin. Or stay!
your purpose is changed; you will not fly
with me and share the fate of the outcast and
the stranger!'
Isora raised her eyes. John was standing
with his head drooped, his hands clasped, his
wild and singular face mellowed by a shade
of overwhelming sadness. The strong man
seemed melted into very womanhood as he
talked to himselfit was his manner when
wrung to the heart by sudden emotion.
`Outcast! Yes, I have no home, nor
father
,
brother, sisternot one friend on the
wide earth of God! Poor Harry! I see your
boyish face and clear blue eyesyour voice,
O Harry, how it comes back to my soul!
And in cold blood they put you to death. I
saw youyes, now I see your face dabbled
in blood, a smile quivering on your lips, and
they are cold forever! Isabel, dishonored
dishonored!
The father hanging before the
porch of his own home; his ashy face
glowing
in morning sun! Isora deserts me
too! Isorathis dear flower which I found
blooming in her Mexican home, and wound to
my heartIsora leaves the outcast to his
fate!'
No wonder that voice, whispering its wild
soliloquy, pierced the maiden's soul.
She rose from the floor, and winding the
robe once more upon her form, laid her right
hand upon his muscular chest, while her eyes,
shining through the intervals of her hair,
burned with emotion too deep for words.
Their eyes met; the maiden seemed to
grow into his heart, even as their glances
mingled in one; a rosy red stole over her
cheeks and bloomed in dewy freshness on her
parted lips.
`I have no home but with thee!'
She did not tell how he had won her heart,
how, appearing at first in her lonely home,
with an atmosphere of mystery and romance
about himhe had besought shelter from his
pursuers. This was many days ago. She
listened to his story, won by the melody of his
voice, the strange light of his eyes, but more
than all by that absorbing story, which spoke
of the dear Prairie Eden, cirled by the trees
of the Island Grove; the gentle brother
Harry, the dead father and the beautiful
Isabel.
From that hour she loved him, and many
a time, in the gloomy chambers of the
mansion
,
secluded from her brother's eye, and
from the gaze of the Argus-eyed Duenna,
this young and passionate woman suffered her
unknown lover to kneel at her feet, to thread
his fingers in the masses of her silken hair,
and looked the magnetism of his soul into her
eyes.
She did not tell him in words this story of
her love, but it shone in her eyes, it spoke
in the brief sentence, uttered with dewy lips
and panting bosom.
`I have no home but with thee!'
Let us pass once more into the shadows of
Isora's bed chamber, where the monk shrinks
back from the touch of a death-cold hand, as
he hears the well-remembered voice.
CHAPTER X.
THE VOICE OF ISABEL.
`How like a voice from the dead comes up
that voice of the wronged and dishonored,
speaking through silence and darkness to
the heart of the wronger.
Texan MSS
.
`
Fear
not, Don Antonio, for I Isabel, of
Prairie Eden am with you!'
The chamber was dark, and that voice,
breaking suddenly from the gloom, sounds
like hollow accents from the lips of death.
`It is her ghost,' groaned the miserable
man, as remorse began to rend every fibre
of his soul. `From the shadows of the grave
she comes to haunt me.'
`Not Isabel the ghost, but Isabel, the
living
,
bloomingfair as when she won your
heart at Prairie Eden.'
The cold hand pressed close within her
own, and thrilled its ice to his heart.
`Nay; shrink not from me, Don Antonio.
You loved me with an idolatry so wild, so
mad! Loved me even when my father hung
writhing on the tree, before his porch, his last
groan gurgling up to God, as your kiss was
on my lips. Long years have passed since
then, Don Antonio; would you like to look
upon my face once more? Or do you fear to
behold those eyes which once filled your soul
those lips which once clung to yours, when
the heart was maddened by a foul drugthe
soul lost in the dreams of opium?'
Don Antonio started from the couch and
struggled nervously to free himself from the
grasp of the cold hand. But it held him as
with the clutch of an iron vice, and the cold
fingers seemed like the bony hands of a
skeleton.
`Would'st like to look upon my face, Don
Antonio?'
Not a word from the lips of the trembling
man. Alone, in that dark room, with a
woman
,
who had come from her grave to haunt
him, he grew icy cold and heard his heart
throb like a death-watch. Yet he was a brave
man, and had done a butcher's work on
human
forms in many a battle.
All the while the sound of voices, in the
next chamber, came indistinctly to his ears,
and added to his frenzy; for he was frenzied
now, cold and hot by turns, now burning with
fever and now chilled into ice.
Suddenly all was still in the adjoining
chamber, and Don Antonio felt the cold hand
and heard the voice again.
`Come, you shall look upon my face!'
The door swung open; Don Antonio had
missed it in his nervous phrenzy, and the cold
hand let the shuddering man into the next
chamber.
`Holy Trinity! It is the novice, Brother
Paulo.'
Retreating with a shudder, Don Antonio
beheld, in the center of the chamber, the form
of a monk, whose dark cowl was thrown over
hts head and face, suffering only a glimpse of
the features to be visible.
The lamp stood on the floor, and flung its
upward rays over that dark, motionless form
with the marble-white hands appearing from
the folds of the shapeless robe. Around were
the pictured walls of that desolate room, the
grim portraits and tapestry that flapped again
the stone which it concealed, with a slow and
hollow sound.
John of Prairie Eden, Isora, and the brave
Don Augustinall were gone from that
gloomy chamber. The cowled figure and
Don Antonio were alone in the silence and
shadow.
`Yes, it is the novice,' said the
well-remembered
voice from the shadow of the cowl.
`The novice who three months ago entered
the monastery of San Francisco, as a lay
brother
,
and soon became the secretary of the
reverend monk, Father Pedro. You have
never seen this face, good father,at least,
never in a cowlnever since
the night
. Oh
you remember it?
the night of Praire
Eden!
'
Don Antonio, even with his shaven crown
and cheek, was by no means an unhandsome
man. His dark, olive features, the boldly
chisselled nose, the ponderous brow,
over-arching
large and lustrous eyes; the mouth,
around whose lips scorn and love, and the
power of a dauntless will, played by turns
all resembled some antique head! moulded in
rich bronze.
He was, we say, by no means an
unhandsome
man; his springy step, his graceful
form, the monkish robe could not altogether
hide. But now he was hideous, livid in the
face, and stricken down as by a pestilence in
every trembling limb; a fear, a horror worse
than death possessed his veins; for before
him, in the cowled form of the novice, or
neophyte
,
Paulo, who had glided by his side for
the last three months, he beheld not a living
shape, but a ghostly image from the regions
of the dead, sent to haunt his perjured soul.
Falling on his knees he crossed his brow
and cried to God for mercy!
The neophyte raised that marble-white
hand; in a moment the cowl would fall from
the face. Don Antonio dared not turn his
eyes away, and yet shuddered as he
anticipated
the disclosure of the ghastly features of
the dead.
The cowl fellO, what a ghastly vision
broke on Don Antonio then!
That face, whiter than alapaster, with the
delicate veins traced on the colorless brow,
and a single spot, deep red, burning like a
flame on each cheek; those lips, pale
vermillion
,
moving without a sound; the eyes,
unnaturally
large, spreading with their strange
light from the brow to the cheek-bone, and
shining with an unfaltering glare upon the
kneeling monk.
Around this deathly face, like a crown of
ebony, was a mass of jet black hair, making
the pale features yet more pale, and giving
additional fire to the glaring eyes.
There are no words in language to picture
the sad reproach, the overwhelming
melancholy
of that face. Around it, like a veil,
seemed to hang the very atmosphere of
despair
.
`You think it sadly changed, Don Antonio,
that face, which once won your
love?
Yet
we are all changed, Father Pedro! Five
years ago you were the handsome cavalier,
pressing the drugged goblet to the lips of a
weak girl, who sank at your feet, her soul
wrung in every fibre, her brain whirling in
madness. Now, you are the monk; and
before
you stands the girl whom you
dishonored
,
while her brother bears your sinless sister
away to his bridal chamber. Bridal chamber
a sweet word, father!bridal chamber!
without one priestly rite or marriage vowa
meaning word, Father Pedro.'
She raised herself erect, in all the pride of
her fallen majesty, and stretched forth her
white hand, as though she scattered the ashes
of her curse upon his brow.
It was pitiable to see the agony of the
monk, whose heart seemed crushed by his
remorse.
`Holy Trinity! My sisterpure and
stainlesswhat hath she done to merit this
wrong.'
`She is guilty even as Isabel of Prairie
Edenguilty of her innocence and beauty.'
It was now the moment, when the cup of
Don Antonio's degradation filled even to the
brim. Before the woman, whom he had
wronged five years agobasely wronged,
with an outrage that has no forgiveness, this
side the grave, no revenge save the
outpouring
of bloodthis proud man now grovelled
like a slave beneath the lash; yes, like a
hound beneath his master's scourge.
`Lady! be you a living woman, or be you
a spirit from the grave, listen for a moment
before you pour the last drop into this bitter
cup. I confess my crimes, my baseness. I
acknowledge this on my knees, thus
crouching
at your feet! I murdered the fatherthe
daughter I dishonoredthe brother I put to
death, even as he begged for a crust, for a
drop of water. No tears, no prayers, not one
writhing of my victim's soul swayed me aside
from my course! Can I confess more? Yet
my sisterin the name of God and his
angels
,
do not suffer wrong to visit her, and of
all wrongs, that outrage which has no
baptism
of redemption but blood. For she is
pure, she is innocent! Take my life, but do
not, Olisten to medo not harm this child
whom my dying father bequeathed to my
care!'
Cold and calm the cowled woman listened
to his prayer. Not one feature in her marble
face indicated emotion; her lip was firm, her
eye unfaltering in its withering scorn.
There was no answer from her lips, but the
monk read it in that silent vengeance of the
pale, beautiful face.
Bowing his head on his hands, the cowl
dropped over his face, and a silence ensued,
unbroken by a sound.
At last it was broken by the echo of a
footstep
,
and a half-clad figure rushed wildly
into
the room.
It was Don Augustin, his face red with
frenzy; stained on the brow with a hideous
wound; his form divested of his handsome
coat of green and gold.
You linger hereyou!shame! Has the
monk
robbed you of all that belongs to the
soldier
, to the
man?
You linger here, and
the accursed heretic has borne your sister
away, passed the guard, disguised in my
coat, and now, perchancebut what
mummery
have we here?'
For the first time he beheld the disguised
woman.
`Don Augustin,'the voice of the monk
was husky as he raised his livid face`in
that cowled form you behold my fatethe
destiny of my housethe woman whose
honor
I crushed without remorse, five years
ago, in her home of Prairie Eden!'
The small, ferret eyes of the Mexican
twinkled with rage.
`Can I believe my eyes? Is it Don
Antonio
Marin whom I see kneeling here? Arise,
be a man? Let us pursue the heretic! there
is a boat by the mole; we will pass through
the American fleet and track the robber to
his den in the Isle of Sacrificios. It is a work
of danger, I knowyou are afraidafraid!
when the honor of the home of your father is
at stake!'
He paced the floor, rubbing his hands
together
,
as he cursed some dozen excellent
oaths in pure Spanish.
`Come, I will go with you I'and Don
Antonio sprang to his feet`but who will
lead us to the den of the heretic?'
A low, sad voice, unbroken by a tremor,
was heard echoing far along the gloomy
chamber,
`That will I!'
And Isabel, with her pale face turned to
the light, her full eyes fixed upon her
betrayer
,
pointed with her white hand toward the
door.
CHAPTER XI.
THE ISLE OF THE SACRIFICE.
`Near Vera Cruz, in the Isle of Sacrificios
where the Aztecs offered the sacrifice of
human bloodsubterranean chambers have
been discovered and images of the
forgotten
religion, with the altar stone on which
the victim was slain.
Texan MSS
.
The
Isle of the sacrifice!'
We stand upon its sandy shore, with the
dark waves, breaking in low murmurs all
around us, the deep night gleaming upon us
from the dark dome, overspread with stars,
San Juan's castle frowning over the waters,
and white Orizaba lowering from afar into the
great temple of the midnight universe.
A strange isle, with its rocks, and sands,
and scattered herbage, stretches before us.
Three hundred years ago the altar of
sacrifice
smoked with his blood-red incense here,
and the groans of the victims echod far over
the waters, as the anointed priest of the faith
of Murder, tore from the mangled breast the
quivering heart.
Even now, beneath this soil, strange
chambers
lie hidden, stored with the gods and
altars
of the Aztec faith.
Still, from yonder shore, echoes the tramp
of armed men, and through the night the sails
of the American ships gleam like white mists,
hovering over the waters.
Suddenly a half-naked form springs from
the waves and stands erect upon the sand.
By the dim light of the stars you may discern
the iron outline of that figure, with loose
trowsers clothing it below the waist, while the
sinewy arms, the firm, broad chest, are bared
to the night breeze.
Had you but one gleam of light you would
behold the flesh along the back severed with
many a hideous welt, mangled into one clotted
mass of sores and blood.
This unknown man, springing from the
waters without one sound or word to warn us
of his approach, shakes his huge arms in the
air, and with clenched hands and groaning
utterance, disturbs the silence with words like
these,
`By I am free! You shall not scourge
my back again, nor dig your lash into my
flesh once more, though I am but a common
sailor in the American Navy! By  I
would sell my soul to the devil, could I but
have the brave captain of the  here, on
this barren shore for five minutesonly five
minutes! Curses upon that flag,curses upon
its stripes and stars! The stripes for the
common sailor's backthe stars for every
petty tyrant who may buy a commission by
crawling round the avenues of the city of
Washington. I swear as God sees me, to
hate and fight against that flag forever! May
the devil catch me this minute if I would not
like to have it here, and grind it into the sand
beneath my feet.'
The escaped sailor turned from the waves
and steadfastly fixed his eyes upon the
barren
isle.
Twenty paces from the shore, a small
rock of peculiar shape rises from the sand.
Near Ihat rock your freedom awaits you.'
What can it mean? To-night, as I lay in
my irons, a paper was pressed into my hand
by a strange man, who whispered, `take this
fileread the paperand swim to Sacrificios
I am here, but where's the rock?'
Even as he spoke there rose at his feet a
small rock, triangular in shape, with its
surface
covered with uncouth figures,
discernible
by the light of the stars. He examined
the rock with a careful and searching
scrutiny
.
All was silent around: no trace of a
human
form was visible.
`I'm prettily fooled!' growled the escaped
sailor with an oath; `but it's my only chance
here goes.'
With a strong effort he raised the rock
from the sand, or to speak more correctly,
lifted it on one end, and a warm light,
streaming
from a square aperture at his feet, bathed
his face, with a ruddy glow. Then it might
be seen that his hair and beard were alike
fiery red in hue, his face embrowned by the
sun and rain, his eyes bleared and swollen,
his teeth revealed by his parting lipsblack,
broken and irregularaltogether a hideous
visage.
At his feet, as from a well, streamed that
hidden light, disclosing a rude ladder, whose
top rested against the side of the aperture. In
an instant his huge form was concealed in
the passage, and with his brawny arms he
drew the rock back to its original position
and descended the ladder. Even steps he
counted, and turning his head over his
shoulder
,
saw that he had entered a small room or
cavern, with a blazing pine-knot attached to
its rocky wall.
In that light, like the crude horrors of some
nightmare dream, he beheld the details of
the place. Three obscene idols, formed of
porphyritic rock, and six feet in height,
supported
the ceiling of the cavern. Between
these idols, three black spaces appeared,
evidently
passages, leading deeper down into
the subterranean chambers of the Isle of
Sacrifice
.
On the wall, near the eastern idol, the
pine-knot was hung; by its light the sailor
read the crumpled paper which he drew from
his trowser's pocket.
`To-day you were lashed like a dog, your
flesh peeled from your bones, at the command
of a petty tyrant. Would you be free?
Tonight
a file will be placed in your grasp, and
with it directions which will enable you to
seek the company of a jovial band who
acknowledge
no lord nor master, save
The Chief of the Free Rangers
.
Isle of Sacrificios,
March 9th, 1847.
It was an interesting thing to observe the
face and form of this escaped sailor, while he
stood by the torch, engaged in deciphering
the somewhat mysterious epistle which we
have given above.
The light streamed over his red hair and
beard, disclosing the sinews of his gigantic
chest, and revealing his broad back, with the
blood oozing slowly from its welts and
sores.
At first his countenance wore a gloomy
scowl,
`I have been fooled,' he murmured, with a
blasphemous oath, and tossed the paper to
the ground.
`Ha! what is this?' he cried, as he beheld
a piece of paper, some ten inches square,
affixed
to the wall by a knife,Beyond the
eastern idol lies your way; pursue it in
darkness
for some hundred paces, descend a
stairway
,
and await further orders from the
C. F. R.'
Without a second thought, the sailor passed
beyond the eastern idol, and measuring his
paces through the darknesswhile a chill air
swept against his cheeksoon came to the
stairway, which he descended, and
discovered
a light shining around the angle of a rock,
distant from where he stood not more than ten
yards.
He soon reached the rock, and started back
with a shout of wonder mingled with delight.
The rock, a huge and irregular crag, with a
similar crag opposite, formed the doorway to
a chamber some twenty feet square, in the
centre of which stood a table, stored with the
most luscious fruit and viands, mingled with
flasks of wine.
This much, at a glance, the escaped sailor
beheld, but entering the chamber he
examined
its minutest details with something of a cold
shudder thrilling every nerve. For around
that table, with a chair at either end, and
spread as if for a banquet, were grouped the
most hideous forms of the ancient Aztec
theology
,
sculptured in every variety of ugliness,
and looking altogether, with their uncouth
shapes, stony eyes and distorted features,
like the attendant devils of some infernal
festival
.
The light in the centre of the table,
standing
amid fig and oranges, grapes and flowers,
imparted a ruddy warmth to the prominent
points of the idols, while everything beside
was wrapped in misty gloom.
`A devilish queer company,' cried the
sailor
as he flung himself in a chair; `but the
wine bottles look tempting, and the cold ham
is not to be `sneezed at'particularly by a
common sailor, who has not tasted food for
twelve hours! Ha! champaigne, as I'm a
sinnerpop! How the sound of that cork
makes them starethese respectable
gentlemen
,
with the stony eyes and peculiarly ugly
faces. A slice of ham, a biscuit, and
another
pull at the champaigne bottle. I feel quite
comfortable, by '
It would require the pencil of some artist
who delights in the grotesque and horrible to
picture this scene.
Relieved by the dark background, the burly
face of the sailor, framed in red hair and
beard, stood boldly out in the light. In one
hand a champaigne bottle, in the other a slice
of ham inserted between two biscuits. His
huge form is comfortably disposed in the arm
chair, and his broad chest begins to swell
and heave with the fiery impulse of the
wine.
Above, the rocky ceiling, and around the
table those distorted forms and uncouth faces,
looking like living things as the light flit
to and fro over the dusky outlines.
One figure towers above the rest; a dim
shape of dark-red stone, with a knife of
obsidian
,
or volcanic glass, extended in its
deformed
right arm. It is the Aztec war-god,
Mexitili
.
And here, where the priests of the
forgotten
creed administered their bloody rites 300
years ago, now sits the escaped slave of the
American Navy making merry, with the wine
bottle in his hand, while his roystering catch
is echoed far along the gloomy recesses of the
cavern.
It was a strange song that he sung, and
seemed to have some bearing upon a murder
done at sea by a captain of the American
Navy,
`They hung at the yard-arm, swing so gay,
Their feet in the air, their faces to heaven.
The Captain wiped his lips, and said,`Let
us pray!'
And then three cheers for God were given.
`The stars and stripes and the tyrant's law!'
Let us merrily, cheerily sing,
For God let us now my boys hurah!
As we merrily, cheerily sing.'
With some dozen more doggrel verses of
blasphemous tenor, the escaped sailor plyed
the wine bottle until the Aztec gods seemed
dancing round him and leering in his face with
their stony eyes.
Then crowning his brow with a wreath of
blossoms snatched from the table, he gravely
drank the health of the idols, one by one,
terming them `all good fellows of the right
stripe, though, dn it! they needn't make
such ugly faces.'
The wine which he drank seemed not so
much to cheer as to madden him. He felt it,
burning like molten fire in every vein, and
encircling his brain as with a mass of liquid
light.
Whether from his long fast or the peculiar
effect of the wine, we cannot decide, but
wherever he turned his head he saw the cold
face of a dead man, who glared upon him,
with eyes like glass, as his body hung
suspended
to an oaken limb.
That quivering oaken limb, that cold white
dead man's face was everywhere, now among
the idol forms, now moving slowly overhead,
now seen in the centre of the table, the limb
always trembling, the face always white, dead
and ghastly.
Yet this sight did not strike the drunken
sailor with anything like fear. He drank only
the more, shouted the louder, and trolled as
he danced around the table, his doggrel song,
until the nooks and corners of the
cavern-room
seemed yelling on with the echo of a
hundred voices.
At last, whether it was a reality or but part
of his drunken dream, we know not, but he
suddenly became aware of the presence of a
new guest, a tall man, dressed in deep black,
a veil upon his face, shrouding his features
from view,
`Would you,' said a voice of full and
manly
intonation, `would you become one of
us?'
`That depends pretty much on who you
are and what you follow.'
And the drunkard staggered to the chair,
endeavering to clear his eyes from the fiery
mist which danced before them.
`We are a band of brothers, who,
gathering
our taxes from the land sea, have turned
this war to our own uses. We have gathered
our members from the oppressed in the army
and navy of the United States. We have a
three-fold objectsecurity, plunder and
revenge
will
you join us?'
`I will, hoss!' cried the sailor, falling into
the slang which he had acquired, years ago,
in the prairies of the west. `Jist show me a
chance now.'
`But you are afraid to take our oath? You
will shudder at the initiation of the
Independent
order of Free Rangers.'
The sailor started to his feet, leaned over
the table, and while his bloodshot eyes rolled
in frenzy, grinned until his discolored teeth
were visible, as he uttered an oath too horrible
for repetition.
`I don't care much what yer oath is; I'm
a Royal Arch Curser myselfI am. And as
to yer Initiation, tell me, what kin a man fear
who has been lashed like a dog on board a
free American ship of war? Show me a
chance I say, and let me but stand free to
face with the captain of the ; only for a
minuteO, only for a minute!'
`Wait here, and in one hour you will be
summoned by a brother of our order. He
will lead you to the altar, where your courage
will be tried; for as our lives will hang upon
your fidelity, it is important that we know
what manner of man you are before we admit
you into our brotherhood. Rememberin
half an hour prepare.'
The figure in black disappeared behind the
image of the war god, Mexitili.
Half an hour passed away. The cavern
no lodger rang with shouts of boisterous
merriment
;
the viands were no longer eagerly
devoured, nor the bottles emptied with mad
rapidity.
Along the table, heaped in inextricable
confusion, were scattered wreaths of
blossoms
,
slices of ham. biscuits, bottles, oranges,
figs and flowers; but the drunken sailor, who
with the print of the Free American Lash on
his back, reeled here an hour ago, singing
blasphemous songs, where is he now.
In the arm chair at the head of the table
behold him, his shock red hair and beard
presenting
a frightful contrast to his face, which
is now as pale as a corse.
He is a very strong man, and yet now he
trembles from head to foot, his bloodshot eyes
neither turn to the right or left but glare
fixedly
before him.
Why this paleness, this trembling, this
unknown
fear?
A deep groan is heard.
`I believe that my heart is burning to a
cinder
within me. My temple throbs as though
the pendulum of a clock were enclosed in my
skull. I cannot drink any moreI tremble;
I am hot and cold by turns. Ah! who's
there?who's that repeating my name?'
`
Ewen McGregor!
' called a voice from the
recesses of the cavern; `do you still desire
to enter the brotherhood?'
`I do,' faltered the sailor.
`Then come hither.'
He arose, tottered along the cavern until
the darkness enclosed him. A cold breeze
swept against his cheek. There was a hand
pressed upon his ownwhy did he turn cold
as that hand touched his fingers?
`Advance twenty steps with me. Take this
knife and obey.'
He took the knife and was led forward in
the darkness until the folds of a curtain
brushed
his face.
`Within the chamber, shrouded by this
curtain
,
lies your victim, bound to the altar of
the Aztec faith, as they bound their victims
three hundred years ago. Do not feardo
not tremble, but think of the lashes you
received
this day, and, without lifting the veil
which conceals the face, strike home. Enter
and obey.'
Why did the brain of the stout-hearted
sailor suddenly feel as though all the blood
in his Herculean frame had rushed into his
skull?
He grasped the knife and dashed the
curtain
aside.
CHAPTER XII.
THE MONK BEHOLDS THE REVENGE.
`It was a bitter drop in his cup, no doubt;
but he had to drink it.'
Texan MSS
.
We will return to the chamber of the three
idols.
Not ten minutes had elapsed since Red
Ewen the sailor left its confines, when three
figures stood revealed by the light of its pine
torch.
Here Isabel, her pale face framed in the
cowl, which increased the strange lustre of
her eyes and made her features both spectral
and ghostly; by her side, Don Augustin, his
form shrouded in a dainty brown mantle,
varied
with silver trappings and glittering with
a single jewelled star. Under the torch, his
bronzed visage distinctly disclosed in every
vein and nerve by the downcast rays, stood
Father Pedro, otherwise called Don Antonio,
clutching his hands in nervous intensity, as
his livid lips trembled with a soundless
motion
.
The cowled lady was calm and cold!
Don Augustin red-faced and fiery ubout the
eyes.
Don Antonio a picture of remorse, carved
in black and bronze.
Around them the obscene images seemed to
live nnd move, as their forms were now
darkened
by a sudden shadow and now illumined
by so ruddy a light.
Don Augustin dashed the sheath of his
sword against the hard floor of the cavern, in
a gesture of extreme impatience.
`Come!the devil and all his imps seize
this night and all its works'he was choice
in his cursing was Don Augustin`we have
lingered long enough, dared danger enough,
good lady it is time for you to fulfill your
promise. Lead us to the haunt of this Texan
heretic and pirate as he is, and we will
force the lady Isora from his grasp.'
`My sister! as my father poured forth his
blood at my feet he consigned thee to my
care!' murmured the monk.
`The brother alone may thread these
passages
with me,' broke in the sad tones of the
cowled Isabel, `Father Pedro alone may
rescue
his sister. Nay, scowl not, Don
Augustin
,
nor curl your lip with scornit must be
so, or I will even leave the poor girl to her
fate.'
`Await here, Don Augustin,' hurriedly
exclaimed
Father Pedro. `I will track these
solitudes alone; if I do not return within an
hour, follow and avenge.'
Why that smile on the pale red lips of
Isabel
,
as she surveys their parting embrace
the cheek of the monk laid against the face
of the soldierthe firm clasp of each other's
hands and the meaning glance of their
eyes.
`I will await youif need be, avenge you,'
Don Augustin laid the paint of his sword to
his lips.
`Come!your sister calls you.' And
Isabel
led the way into the darkness beyond the
western idol.
Saw you that pale face turned to the light,
the moment ere it disappeared, the eyes and
the lips wearing the same expression, cold,
relentless, ghostly?
Now came the moment of Don Antonio's
triumph. Through these dark passages, where
the air was hot and stifling and chilled with
subterranean draughts by turns; down these
rude stairways, hewn three centuries, aye,
perchance ten centuries ago, in the solid rock
up these rugged ascents where the footstep
became unsteady as it encountered the stony
fragments flung over the dark path; on and
on, in darkness, the monk followed his silent
guide.
The darkness was dense, palpable, it
seemed
to shut him in like the boards of a coffin;
the silence was dead and appalling, unbroken
save by the echo of their footsteps.
Isabel was silent; for a quarter of an hour
no word passed her lips, but her cold hand
was damp with a clammy moisture that
chilled
the hand of Don Antonio throughout every
nerve.
How the consciousness that he was alone
with the woman whom he had so foully
wronged, pressed like a sentence of Death on
his soul!
Still, in all the wilderness of his baseness
and crime, there bloomed one beautiful flower
more lonely from the very blackness that
encircled itthe love of a pure and stainless
sister.
At lastoh, how gladlywith what an
involuntary
cry of delight he beheld ita light
shone from afar over the darkness of their
way.
Isabel spoke for the first time,
`That light shines on your sister's face!'
The word touched Don Antonio's heart
with new life.
`On, on!'he shuddered`it may be too
late.'
Nearer and larger grew that light until it
resembled a sun, so round, and full, and
blazing
it broke upon their eyes, an unearthly sun
glancing over the darkness of these Aztec
vaults.
Why linger on each moment of stifling
suspense
?
At last they stood near the light. It shone
out upon the rock bound passage, from a
circular
space, framed by rocks and lighted up
the roof, the floor, the walls of this lone
corridor
,
with a red, glaring glow.
`The passage ends here,' whispered Isabel.
`That light shines from a chamber, from
which we are separated by a solid wall of
rock.'
`Let us enter the chamber; my sister is
there,' gasped the monk.
`Your sister, indeed, is there, but you
cannot
enter the chamber, unless you retrace
your steps, and from the chamber of the three
Idols depart by the eastern passage. It may
be well for you to do this, but first advance,
and through this crevice behold your sister.'
Don Antonio saw her looksaw her face
lighted for a moment by a smileoh, how
wild and unearthlyand was afraid to
advance
.
He feared to behold the secret of that
unknown chamber.
She took him by the hand and dragged
him to the sperture in the solid wall of
rocks.
This was the sight which he saw:
A small room, circular in form, whose wall
was formed by one undulating curtain of faint
crimson, which was supported by three
slender
white pillars. From the celingit was
like a dome, and painted to resemble a
midnight
sky: blue, spotted with starshung a
fiery globe which bathed the place in dazzling
light.
This light, which seemed to float and wave
in waves of liquid flame, was tempered and
softened by clouds of snowy incense smoke,
which emerged from the thousand apertures
of the globe, and wrapped the room in
intoxicating
odors.
Beneath the globe, in the centre of the rich
matting which supplied the place of a carpet,
was a cushion or couch of rich scarlet velvet,
fringed with gold; and near it a sofa or divan
of the same rich tevture.
On the sofa, half seated and half reclined,
was a man of some twenty-five years, he did
not seem more; his dark hair and beard,
curled
and perfumed, after the manner of the
luxurious Sybarites of old. His broad chest
heaved beneath a garment of purple velvet,
flashing with gold and jewels. Fine linen
about his bold throat, and around his bronzed
hands; a broad belt of rich embroidery
across his chest; a dagger quivering by his
side.
His face glowed; it shone in every feature
with a mad delight. It was a face that could
not easily be forgotten.
Behold that downcast head, those large
eyes, whose intense gaze grows soft with
moisture, those parted lips, which seem
unclosed
in the act of murmuring words of
passion.
His right arm was extended, it held aloft a
golden goblet, curiously carved and brimming
with deep purple wine.
But there was a fair hand laid upon the
wrist of that extended arm.
Well might Don Antonio gasp for breath!
A woman's form was couched upon the
velvet cushion, her head resting upon the
knee of the man, as with an intoxicating
langor
stealing over her face she gazed upward
through the intervals of her soft, silken hair,
and lifted her arm, clutching his wrist as if to
seize the goblet.
She was clad in an azure tunic, or loose
frock, which fell, without a girdle, from her
shoulders to her knees, revealing by the soft
gradations of every fold, the gentlest
undulations
of her shape. Below the knees her
limbs were bare, their snowy whiteness
contrasting
with the scarlet rubiness of the
cushion
;
a delicate sandal of pink satin was bound
to the sole of each foot, leaving all beside, in
its unveiled loveliness, the delicate azure
veins, perceptible beneath the softly flushed
carmine skin.
A diamond sparkled on the tunic, where it
half and only half concealed her bust; it
sparkled with every pulse of her bosom, shone
as that bosom rose, and glittered softly like a
fading star as it fell.
No more beautiful, no more delicate
contrast
can be imagined, than that which was
presented by the soft whiteness of her half
revealed
shoulders, and the mazes of her silken
hair, as black as a pall.
One tress fell over her rising bosom, as i
in shame, and veiled it as it heaved, like a
creamy billow, into light.
The face told the full story of that mad
intoxication
which thrilled every nerve of this
beautiful girlthis Sultana of the rock-bound
bower.
Through the lipsthey were slightly
parted
glowing
with moist vermillion, gleamed
the ivory teeth. Over the cheek, soft,
rounded
,
downy, burned a rose-bud flush, which
now contracted in one intense heat of passion
and again seemed to spread forth its rosy
leaves over the whole face,
The eyes, bright and dewy, and shining
languidly from the heavy lids, which seemed
weighed down by the intoxicating ordors of
the place, were centered upon the face,
glowering down upon that beautiful form with
a glance not to be mistaken.
`Wilt drink, Isora? Wilt drink to our
merry life upon the broad ocean, where I, thy
lover-husband, will gather spoil for theefor
thee
from every flag, and win diamonds for
thy white brow from every clime? And
after
the battle is over, the good ship, with its
royal Black Flag will tranquilly glide into the
green cove of our island home. Thou wilt
stand upon the shore, waving thy white arms
as thy Rover comes up the steep cliffs, comes
home to thee, covered with laurels and spoil!
Drink Isora, to the days when we shall dwell
on our island home!'
She raises her white arms, the goblet is in
her hand, its golden rim is pressed against her
red lip, the purple wine glides slowly, in a
rich, mellow current, through that quivering
portal.
`I love none but theethee only Juan!
Wherever thou goest, upon sea or shore, I
will go with thee! In battle'her slight
nostril
quivered`I will bind on thy sword and
laugh as the red mist waves over thee; in
peace, when the fight is over, this bosom
shall pillow thy head, as we sit at the porch
of our island home and gaze upon the young
moon rising over the waveless sea.'
She twined her white arms upon his sinewy
hands and dashed her silken hair over his
arms. All the while her bosom, veiled by
that solitary tress, rose like a creamy billow,
bearing on its creast a dark and glossy
burden
.
The incense smoke, agitated by a current
of air, descended and swept over them like a
veil.
Don Antonio could not withdraw his gaze
from the aperture. Oh, what fiend but would
pity him now, as the crushing agony of his
soul glares in his glassv eyeballs, and quivers
in his parched lips. He cannot withdraw his
gaze from the aperture; his eye is fixed upon
the undulating veil of the incense smokehe
hears those kisses, those words of passionate
transport, but cannot withdraw his gaze.
Isabelis she still cold and calm? Does
no relenting throb pulsate in her ice-cold
bosom
?
The light glaring around that passage
revealed
that motionless form, resembling a
marble
image of vengeance, veiledall save the
facein a monkish cowl.
Once, only, there was something like a
burning tear upon her colorless cheeka
tremor
on her lip. It was for an instantshe
was marble again.
Don Antonio turned, he seized her
death-cold
hands,
`Woman!' he fiercely shrieked, `have you
no pity? Look! my sister, my only sister's
senses drugged by maddening draughtsher
honor torn from her in a moment of delirium.
Pitymercynot for my sake, but for
hers!'
Isabel was silent; one word, after a pause,
she gasped; one only, and that with an
evident
effort.
`
Prairie Eden!
'
The monk fell backward, as if blasted by
a thunder stroke. But those sounds in the
curtained chamber, those kisses of mad
passion
,
those raptures of voluptuous transport
he heard them still, and was nerved with the
savage strength of despair.
`You must save my sister! By the Holy
Trinity I swear your life shall pay the
forfeit
of her outraged honor. Your life! I
swear it!'
He had grasped her wrists, and all the devil
of his soul shone from his features, horribly
distorted by passion, rage, madness.
With but a single phrase she answered
him,
`
Rancho Salado!
'
The hands of the monk fell. He beat his
forehead against the rocks, grappled the cold
surface until his nails were splintered at the
finger ends; and in the pauses of his phrenzy
he shouted aloud her namehis sister's
name,
`Isora!'tis your brother who calls.
Isora, in the name of your dead father,
hear me!'
The incense smoke waved aside, the monk
looked through the aperture.
`Oh God! this is worse than eternal death
she hears me notkisses! His arms about
her neckthe goblet! Isora! O shame
despair
!
Villain, I defy youproclaim you
cowardmonster! Will meet you face to
face in combat.Isora!'
And like the chorus to his broken
ejaculations
,
was heard those whispering voices,
`Mine?'
`Thine only!'
`But my poor brother Harry, with his pale
face and blue eyes, we'll drink to his memory
drink to him as he kneels in presence of
his murderer, the prayer yet warm upon his
lips, as he falls coldcolddead!
Vengeance
to the murderer of poor Harry!'
`Give me the goblet. Thine eyes madden
thy voice whirls my soul as on a billow of
flame. I drink, Juandeath and shame to
the murderer of thy brother!'
`Isora!' groanednot shoutedthe monk
as he fell back from the fatal aperture in the
rocks, his soul stupified by the voluptuous
frenzy which burned his eyes as he beheld
it!
Isabel hears this, and does not relent? Ah,
the cold, remorseless vengeance of the
dishonored
woman fail her at once. You see a
vivid flash brighten over her face; she veils
her eyes, beating the hard earth all the while
with her tiny foot.
`He murdered my fatherI see his cold
faceoh God! how it glares in the rising
sun. Harry, too, went forth from home, and
came back no more. There stands the
murdered
.
My honorthat which is the world,
heaven, life to a womanhe crushed into the
dust, as the poisoned cup whirled its frenzy
through my brain. I know it allconfess it
my God; but his sister, she hath done no
wrong; her ravings, uttered in the madness of
passion, they madcen me. I can bear it no
nger!'
She turned aside from the glare of the light
and her footsteps echoed along the caverned
passage.
The monk raised his eyesshe was gone.
His despair was now complete. It was a
horrible
sight to see him tear the flesh from his
face with his splintered nails.
Suddenly three forms veiled in blue robes,
appeared in the light, their faces lost to view
in the folds of their garments.
With one movement they seized Father
Pedro
,
bound him despite his frantic resistance,
and held their sharp knives at his bared
throat.
With the bandage across his mouth, the
corns on his arms, these veiled forms lifted
him to the aperture once more.
He looked.
Those who held him were thrilled with the
cold shudder that pervaded his form.
Once more!
He lay motionless in their grasp, his proud
spirit broken, his face changed and fallen, as
though the ice of death had been poured
upon it.
`You have beheld only the beginning of
justice as administered by the Free Rangers.
Now comes the end!'
Like an inanimate burden they bore the
conscious but palsied monk into a dark
passage
which suddenly opened near the bright
aperture in the wall. Whether it was a secret
door or only a hollow in the rocks, which had
evaded his search, he knew not, but suffered
hem to bear him unresistingly along.
CHAPTER XIII.
RED EWEN IS INITIATED.
`A singular rite was the initiation of the
Free Rangers. A dead man was placed
upon the Aztec altar and'
Texan MSS
.
Red
Ewen grasped the knife and pushed the
curtain aside. It was a wondrous sight that
met his gaze. He was a man of giant strength
and superhuman nerve, infernal beyond the
fancy of a devil in his remorseless cruelty,
but within half an hour a strange coldness,
succeeded by a burning senation, as sudden
and as strange, had robbed his iron sinews of
their vigor.
The knife trembled in his grasp.
He stood in a room, or cell, or vault, as you
may please to term it, hollowed out of the
living rock, not more than five yards in
diameter. The floor was level, the ceiling
shaped like a dome, but all was solid rock.
In the centre of the vault, a square form of
stone arose, a block six feet long and three
wide, with its sides sculptured into every
variety
of obscene or hideous hieroglyphic.
At the head of the blockit resembled an
ancient altar of sacrificetowered a shape of
brownish rock, veined with bright scarlet and
re resenting in its ferocious eyes, embruted
features and upraised war club, the Aztec god
of war.
Around the altar were grouped four living
forms, clad in long robes, with a mantle
falling
over every face.
The mantles were blue, the robes bright
scarlet. From every robe was extended an
arm grasping a lighted torch. Their
mingling
rays filled the vault with light and scented
the air with grateful perfume.
Red Ewen stood like a statue, dumb with
amazement.
To understand his feelings we must call to
mind the incidents of his life, which took place
upon this eventful 9th of March, 1847.
This morning he writhed beneath the hang
man's lash, on board a ship of war bearing
the banner of the Stars.
Only a few hours ago he lay in his chains,
when a veiled man appear in the darkness,
and taught him the way to freedom.
An hour ago he danced in drunken
madness
in the Aztec banquetting chamber, his
veins fired by something more than
champaigne
,
some deadlier poison than the venom
of alcohol.
Now a change had come over him. The
madness was gone. Cold, hot, fire, ice by
turns, he stood under the door of this strange
vault, knife in hand, and shuddered as he
beheld
the four veiled forms whose heaving
breasts told that they were living, the solitary
shape whose horrible deformity spoke of the
dim ages, long since departed, when the
quivering
victim, a strong man full of life, was
hewn to pieces in this very cell.
One by one, the living figues addressed the
escaped sailor,
`Could you become a Free Ranger,
admitted
to all the privileges of our
Brotherhood
?'
`The right to spoil and slay, wherever a
sure foot, a true steed, a good ship may bear
you?'
`To gather tribute from all nations, on
land and sea alike, and select from the
loveliest
women of the earth the woman who you
shall call wife so long as it may please you
and no longer?'
`A short life and a merry one! A life with
the outcasts and oppressed of all nations, a
jovial
band, who know no laws save those
proclaimed
by their chief, who reward the
traitor's
deed with the sharpest knife and the
strongest cord?'
Then their voices joined in chorus,
`Would you, Ewen McGregor, escaped
slave from the American Navy, become a
free ranger of the land and sea?'
`I would!' faltered Ewen, as the light
played
over his enormous chest and his broad
back seamed with weltering stripes.
With his brutal form and animal face, he
stood in that vault likd the appropriate
demon
of the scene, his burly face, with
blood-shot
eyes and thick lips, disclosing black and
broken teeth, encircled in his short, stiff, red
hair and long, matted beard.
His face was pale, his lip quivered as he
uttered the response.
`Then take the vow.'
Far be it from me to repeat that eloquent
liturgy of blasphemy.
It was loathsome enough, horrible enough,
in its crowded imprecations to satisfy the
Demon
of Blasphemy himself. Even Ewen
shuddered, but that was with the fire and ice
which possessed his veins by turns.
`And if I fail in this to obey the commands
of my leader, or betray the secrets of the Free
Rangers, may the knife of the suicide sever
my heart, may earth deny me a grave when I
am dead, and the beasts feed on my senselass
corse.'
So ran the mildest part of the loathsome
ritual.
On his knees, before the altar, he took the
oath, `to obey the commands of
the Leader
,
whatever they might be,'and knife in hand
he rose.
`Advance!'
The voice sounded deep and hollow as it
echod back from the dome.
Red Ewen drew near the altar, his animal
visage growing deathly pale.
`Uncover the form of the dead!'
At the word one of the figures robed in
scarlet, his face mantled in blue, extended
his hand and lifted the altar cloth, until a
small space of flesh, evidently a glimpse of
a human chest, on the left side, near the heart
was visible, the veins distinctly marked
beneath
the clear olive skin.
`Prepare for the last act of initiation!
Behold
this dead manraise your knife and
strike deep into his chest. Do this,prove
your defiance of all obligations, imposed by
what pious fools denominate moralityprove
that you fear nothing, either living or dead,
and we hail you as a brother.'
`Yet, I swear by  he lives!' faltered
Ewen, as an indefinable fear palsied his arm.
`Lookhe is not deadthis man upon the
stonehe breathes.'
`Folly! your fancy deceives youhe is
deadaye, dead. He was a traitor, and he
died according to our laws. Advance and
strike.'
The blood rushed to Red Ewen's face,
filling
every vein with the sudden and ferocious
instinct of carnage. Each starting eyeball
was filled with ejected blood; his thick lips
became
dark purple; he grasped the knife with
all the vigor of his Herculean arm and came
nearer to the altar.
Still it seemed to move, that chest,
concealed
by the cloth, nay, the bared spot of brown
flesh seemed to glow, as with the sudden
impulse
of strong emotion. True, the face of
the dead man was veiled in the altar-cloth
yet still the bosom seemed to quiver with
life.
LookEwen stands over the dead, the
knife raisedit is ten inches longthe point
poised over the bared flesh.
A hissing soundit descendsit is buried
to the hilt in the breast of the dead man.
There was a pause, while Ewen with his
hand clutching the hilt, exerted all his strength
to withdraw the blade,
and in the action, he
felt the body of the dead man writhe beneath
him
.
At the same moment the altar-cloth was
partly raised and the face disclosed.
Ewen, the giant with an appetite for
carnage
like the tiger's, staggered from the altar
as though the knife had pierced his own
bosom
,
instead of the bosom of the dead.
For that face was a fearful thing to look
upon.
The cloth bound around the jaws of the
uncovered
face did not conceal the horrible
working of the features, nor hide the slow,
rolling motion of the eyeballs, terribly bright
with death, as they turned from side to
side.
A moan was indistinctly heard.
`Don Antonio Marin!' shouted Red Ewen,
as his veins seemed filled with an intolerable
heat, and staggering back, he gazed stolidly
upon the writhing features of the dying
man.
A figure dressed in blue and gold, stepped
lightly over the entrance of the vault, and
approached the altar.
The torch light which shone over the
contorted
features of the dyinghark! that
gurgling
moan!played upon the broad chest,
the firm features of the intruder.
`John of Prairie Eden!' shouted Ewen, as
he stood rooted to the floor. `Hey! what's
this! By the living  there is some plot
in this! You here! Who lighted this vault
with those hellish flames, and sent the devils
dancing around that dying Spaniard?
Ah!'
He fell, writhing in horrible convulsions, to
the floor, the foam frothing round his lips as
his fingers clutched the hard stone.
By the altars's head, his brow uncovered,
and his broad chest glowing with purple and
flashing with diamonds, stood John of Prairis
Eden, his features wearing a marble
calmness
,
only disturbed by a slight movement of
the nether lip.
There was a Satanic beauty about his face,
whose broad forehead, shaded by dark hair,
firm, aquiline nose, compressed lips
appearing
in the midst of his moustache and beard
and large eyes, deep sunken beneath arching
brows, now wore an expression not the less
infernal because it struggled with a look of
quiet composure.
He bent over the uncovered face of Don
Antonio, and whisperedeven as his beard
touched the brow of the dying manas his
eyes, blazing with rapture, shot their glance
into the starting eyesballs of the wretched
victim
whispered
in a soft voice, and with a
pleasant smile, these words:
`When I withdraw the knife you will die,
my friend. Hold, you will injure yourself if
you attempt to speak again, for that bandage
on your mouth makes it difficult for you to
dreathe, much less speak. Be perfectly calm,
my dear friend, for I have much to say to you
ere you die. Do you know me? Do you
know me? Do you recognise these features?
Whom'his breath swept the cheek of Don
Antonio`whom do I resemble, brother
Harryeh? Or do I look like my father?
Or, holddo you not trace a resemblance in
my smile to the gay laugh of Isabel?'
The cloth over the mouth was agitated by
a convulsive motion, as the dying man made
a horrible effort to speak.
He knew the face. Look how his starting
eyeballs glare into the eyes of his
Doomsman
!
This scene seemed even to affect the forms
in robes of scarlet with blue mantles over
their faces. By the light of the torches which
they grasped you can see their robes heave,
as from the impulse of horror,agony.
On the floor, his giant form distorted into
a shapeless heap of deformityso horrible
was the fire which gnawed his intestines
Red Ewen lay, the foam gathering in white
beads upon his swollen lips, the white
surface
of his eyeballs suddenly turned to
scarlet
.
`Oh, it was horrible'he raved`to force
me to drink that goblet of melted lead, hot,
hissing hot! It burns!it burns! O, water
water! You have covered my brain with
hot coals! Take your knee from my breast,
old man of Prairie Eden; for you are a dead
man; your eyes are coldI hung you
myself
to the tree'
`That is Red Ewen's voice, my dear
friend.' And John, smiling pleasantly, bent
over the face of Don Antonio. `Do you know
his voice? A pleasant voice! You heard it
once in Prairie Eden, I am glad you know
it. It was Red Ewen that stabbed you.
Ungrateful
dog, to turn his fangs against his
master. My God!' he cried, with an air of
chagrin, `this man is dyinghe has not more
than one minute's life in him, and I have so
much to say to him. So many important
things!'
Look yonder, where the curtain hangs over
the narrow entrance, and do not breathe lest
you disturb the beautiful vision. A lovely
face, with glossy black curls waving around
it, appears amid those curtain folds; the eyes,
dancing with wild light, gazing with wonder
and fear upon the strange group of this
cavern
vault.
It is Isora, whose brother, pinioned and
gagged, the knife sunken to the hilt in his
breast, lies writhing in death agony upon the
altar.
One movement of Johnthe mere change
of his position, for a single inch to either side
will reveal the horrible face of the dying
brother
to his sister's gaze. But John does not
moveall good angels be thankedthere is
a belt of shadow between the dying face and
the lustrous eyes of the sister,
`Ha!that footstep! Isoro!'
Without moving one inch, John turned his
smiling face over his shoulder and whispered
gently,
`My love, you have come. It is well,
Remain
where you are, for a moment only,
beautiful Isora! How I love to linger on the
music of that name
Isora
!'
The name rung through the vault in
mellow
cadence.
She remained there, trembling on tip-toe,
in the narrow entrance of the vault, her azure
tunic relieved by the dark curtain which
touched her shoulder as it fell; her snowy
right arm raised upon her panting breast,
and half mantled by her unbound hair.
`Juan, I will stand here until you bid me
enter.'
How musical the low tones of that
voluptuous
woman's voice! It broke like a
whisper
from some blessed spirit upon the stillness
of the vault, and right upon it an infernal
chorus
after angel music, clashed the howl of
Ewen, writhing on the floor; the faint moan
of Don Antonio gasping from the cloth that
bound his mouth,
He
heard that voice, KNEW that his sister
was there, almost within arm's length, and
yet he could not speak to her, she could not
see him.
`Isora is here, my dear friendIsora!'
He whispered in the very ear of Don Antonio
`would you like to speak to her? She loves
me, the beautiful girl; and is minemine
WITHOUT marriage! Are you perfectly
sensible
,
Don Antonio? Have courage man, for
you will need it. I am about to place the
cloth over your faceit will never be lifted
while you live. Never will you look upon a
human face again. And you will die, with
the voice of your own sister in your ears; that
voice, which you love to hear, invoking
vengeance
on the murderer of the father and the
brother; eternal vengeance on the betrayer of
the sister.'
It was horrible to see the effort of the dying
man to unpinion his arms and make one
intelligible
sound through the thick cloth which
bound his mouth. Once from side to side
rolled his glassy eyeballs. John beheld and
smiled. Once, the nerves of his face
twitched
like the nerves of a corpse agitated by
galvanism
;
and then
John quietly placed the cloth upon his face
and shut him from the light forever!
Turning from the altar, his face beaming
with a smile, he wound his arm around the
lithe waist of the young girl, and led her
genly
forward.
Did the dying man hear that tripping
footstep
?
`Lovemy own Isora!' He gaed his gaze
upon her face, glowing so rosy red, on the
lip and cheek, shooting such voluptuous
languor from the eyes. `You know my wrongs
have heard me tell of the incarnate fiend
who hung my father, in his grey hairs, to the
felon's tree; who had no pity for poor Harry,
though he knelt to him in the Plaza of
Saltillo
,
and implored mercy with his blue eyes.
The fiend, Isora, who bought my sister's
dishonor
wlth the price of a father's life, and
bade her rise from his arms that she might
behold the dead face of that very father,
glowing in the rising sun. Isora, you have
heard it all!'
`Juan, speak of it no moreno more!
Woman
as I am, weak and trembling, there is yet
the blood of old Castile burning in my veins!
I will roam the world with thee, Juan. Come
we will find this wretch, and will look upon
his agonies while you avenge! Yes, I will
pray God to nerve your arm, as you strike
deep, exclaiming with every blow,for my
brother, for my father, for my sister!'
Eye flashing, bosom panting, she laid her
white arms upon his shoulder and looked up
into his face.
Did the dying man hear that voice. Look!
the cloth on his breast quivers in the light.
`You need not roam far, my love. Look!
upon the altar lies the incarnate fiend, the
remorseless
destroyer of my race.'
`There?Let me look upon his face.'
She started forward; John held her by the
arms, but lightly, as though he hesitated; his
dark eye perusing all the while the
passionate
warmth of her face.
`No, Isora! You must not gaze upon him,'
he said; `but hold.Wretch, now quivering
on the altar, I see your chest heaving with its
last pang, and know that your moment is near.
I ask you now, in this moment whose flight
will leave you cold, would you like to look on
a woman's face, and hear her beautiful lips
curse you as you die? If your answer is `yes,'
utter but the slightest moan and your face
shall be uncovered.'
The wretch moaned.
Yes, rather than die thus in the dark, cut
off from the sight of a human face forever, he
would look upon his sister and hear her curse
him as he died. Little did he imagine that this
beautiful sister was unconscious of his
presence
;
that she did not know him as the `
incarnate
fiend.' If there was one thought
darker than another in his dying heart, it was
the thought, `to be cursed by my own sister,
the beloved of my heart, as I d e!'
In that thought he felt, horribly felt, the
full retribution for his crimes.
`No! By the fiend whom you have served,
you shall not look upon a human face again.
Die in darkness, in the name of the father,
the brother, and Isabel!'
That movement of the altar-cloth.
`This form upon the floor, Juan, it
frightens
methis monster with the white foam on
his lips?'
`The accomplice of the fiend, who blindly
struck the blow which killed his master, and
now dies near him, his heart eaten by poison.
Ewen, I say; do you know me? Champaigne
is a glorious drink, but arsenicugh! Rise
man, and die with some courageonly brute
courage, if you willdon't writhe there like
a dog.'
The voice, thrilling in cold tones through
the vault, seemed to rouse Ewen from his
stupor.
He rose heavily into a sitting posture and
brushed his brawny hand across his bloodshot
eyes; the whole scene seemed to undulate
before himthe altar, the silent figures, the
beautiful Isora and the calm, smiling John of
Prairie Edenall seemed to glide slowly to
and fro.
He brushed the white foam from his lips;
it was evident that his hour was near, for his
finger nails were blue, and the ruddy hue of
his face began to deepen into purple. The
change of death was on him.
`John, I know you,' he gasped, as though
every word was wrung from him by infernal
tortures. `A bad man, JohnI've been.
In Philadelphiamy boy!have mercy
on him!
'
With those incoherent words, uttered with
hands clutching each other, and bloodshot
eyes rolling in death, he sank slowly into a
shapeless heap on the floor.
There was no groannot even a gasp.
His purple face became black, his swollen
lips the color of blueish clay, his broad chest
was frecked with crimson spots. Not one
quiver disturbed his sinewy form, nor did a
single tremor announce that a spark of life
yet lingered in his own muscles. He was
deadhorribly distorted, and blackened, and
swollendead as the rock upon which he
laid.
Why does that sudden paleness cross the
face of the Avenger? Does his heart quail
now?
When he taunted the poisoned man, and
bade him rise and die like a man, he
anticipated
a volume of curses from his foamy lips
he believed that Ewen would yell forth his
last breath in blasphemies.
But those incoherent words, uttered with
his last breath, in the voice so very strangely
softened and with a look of horrible entreaty,
`My boyin Philadelphiahave mercy on
him!'
John of Prairie Eden, so remorseless in his
Satanic revenge, felt a sudden shudder
pervade
his form, a horrible gulf, black,
fathomless
,
yawned before his eyes; he trembled and
sank on his knees, his face buried in the
bosom
of Isora.
Her soft hands played upon his forehead;
her dark tresses waved over his shoulders.
He could feel her heart beating warmly on
his cheek, but that voluptuous pulsation,
could not still the prayer of the poisoned
wretch which shrieked forever in the
Avenger's
ears`in Philadelphiamy boyhave
mercy on him.'
The figures in blue and scarlet are
motionless
,
the torches still burning in their
extended
hands; Ewen is blackened and dead
upon the floor; Mexitili glares in horrible
grotesqueness at the head ef the altar; John
is kneeling, his head pillowed upon Isora's
breast, and for the last time heaves the altar
cloth, as a hollow sound, the death-rattle,
echoes round the vault.
Then over the threshold comes the form of
a woman, clad in a monkish gown, her
bosom
panting, her breath trembling in gasps,
her pale face flushed in every pore. You see
her as she stands over the strange scene, her
white hands clutching the robe to her breast,
and her eyeseach pupil surrounded by a
white circleglare in silent agony from face
to face.
Her dark hair, gathered like an ebony
crown around her browswollen in every
vein with intense emotionsburst its cincture
and waves in glossy tresses over her
shoulder
.
Glossy and dark, and yet, amid its
blackness, there are streaks of silver grey.
Then to the altar advanced the miserable
woman, whose life had been an ante-part of
hell since the dark day when her honor was
wrecked; she saw the clothed form on the al:
tar and lifted the cloth from the face,
and
But there are emotions of the heart, agonies
of the soul, which angels fear to behold, and
devils dare not look upon, and we will drop
the pall over the scene, over that sight which
we cannot witness,
Isabel of Prairie Eden gazing upon the
dead face of her betrayer!
CHAPTER XIV.
FROM VERA CRUZ TO PHILADELPHIA.
`The vengeance was cemplete, but now came
the turn of the Avenger.
Texan MSS
.
It
was in the Walnut-street Theatre.
I hear the snarl of the critic, and thus he
barks,
`Here's a pretty transitionfrom the
Aztec
vault of Vera Cruz to a Philadelphia
theatre
!
Horrible! Here we have a story
commencing
on the prairies of Texas, suddenly
dashing away to a desolate rancho in the heart
of Mexico, then to Vera Cruz and the vaults
of Sacrificios, and last of all to a Philadelphia
theatre!'
This is truly horrible, and the author who
is guilty of the deed, should be condemned
to solitary confinement for one day, with a
dozen critics, selected at random from the
newspapers and magazines of the large cities.
Such a punishment could make the warmest
blood run cold.
Just fancy it in all its details. One poor
author among a dozen critics. Here a critic
from Boston, brimming full of cant, breathing
it, talking it, living in itcant from head to
foot, all cant. By his side, distinguished by
a jockey eoat and dirty-brown mustache, a
Cockney critic from New York, talking
alternately
of Progress and Pennies, wanting very
much to knowin one breathwhen the
human
race will take passage in the
Progressional
Steam Car for ths Millenium, and how
much you will give him for a first-rate puff in
his paper?
Far in the corner of the cell where our
author
is confined, behold the magazine critic of
Philadelphia; a jaunty thing, delicate in
perfume
,
with oysterish eyes; the scissors in
one hand and the scrap-book in the other.
A prim gentleman altogether, who pities our
author in yellowish tears forhorrible!
being `popular with the
many
rather than the
select
.' That `many' the rouge, hardy
people
of the workshop and plough; that `
select
,'
some dozen newspaper and magazine
editors of Philadelphia, who hate each other
most fraternally, and yet keep saying, all the
year round to one another,`you are a great
man!' and `I am a great man!' and `we
are all great men!' So, Allah Bishmallah,
there is but one Literature; it is in
Philadelphia
,
and Humbug is its prophet!
Or yet; to go from small things to smaller,
a critic south of Mason & Dixon's linea
Baltimore critic. The drollest of all kinds of
critics; the very friskiest of all kinds of
insect
,
crawling and biting around the skirts of
literature, and growing fat as it crawls and
steals. Look at it; a critic, whose whitish
hair, eyelashes and beard, and tallow
complexion
,
all indicate a human thing, gone to
seed, and sweltering in decay, long before it
has enjoyed one moment of healthy ripeness.
It publishes a large sheet, called soundingly,
`the Universal Hemisphere,' and in the
agonising
effort to be witty or die, take some
such slang name as `Major Tomkins,' an
writes in bad spelling, bad grammar, and bad
decency; all being very humorous and quite
original.
Imagine a poor author condemned to be
crawled over and bitten, for one day only, by
vulgarity and indecency, impersonified in a
Major Tomkins, a Baltimore critic.
My kind readers in the country, you will
pardon me for this digession about critics,
when I assure you that it was undertaken
entirely
for your good. Call this digression a
preface to my story, if you please, and I will
explain.
You very often see a ferocious attack in
some city perodical, which cuts into ribbons
a book which you have been pleased to buy,
read and love. You wonder at this, and
perchance
take the attack for an honest
expression
of prejudice, although you, of course,
deny its fairness and truth. Your opinions
would be somewhat modified were you aware
that criticism is in the citiespretty
generally
,
and with some honorable exceptionsa
mere matter of dollars and cents, a business
contract between booksellers and criticsso
much praise for so many penniesan
honorable
understanding between those who sell
books and who notice them; that genius is
a thing made altogether of puffs, and that he
who has most dollars can buy most puffs, and
is, of course, the most extensive genius.
You will pardon me if I have the smallest
opinion of these magazine and newspaper
critics, for in a circle of twelve, I have in my
time seen one crittc who had forged another
man's name; one who was a clergyman, and
took his `brandy and water,' and was often
led by his sympathies, with virtue, of course,
into place better known than named; one
who had issued counterfeit notes in his time,
and finding this kind of paper rather
unprofitable
took to newspapers; one who had been
convicted of swindling; and some three or
four who divided among them the shattered
fragments of the Decalogue, broken into
pieces and trampled under foot.
Rather a jovial band of moralists, this?
These critics will be the first to attack my
story and pronounce it a combination of
improbabilities
,
when from first to last it is
founded on published facts, which I have
varied
,
to avoid the imputation of an unjustifiable
personality.
When they blow their blast, and snarl
their snarl, you will understand at once what
they mean. That I am either too poor to buy
their praise with money, or that I have
nothing

with favor on that creed which taught you to
worship apes, lest they would do you a
mischief

It was in the Walnut-street theatre.
Look over this thronged house, swarming
from the ceiling to the cellar, with lifelife
in every shapetapestried in its three tiers
of boxes with human faces, a sea of ragged
humanity boiling over in the pitand tell me
is it not a very solemn sight? Solemn! You
laugh.
Yes, solemn as the air of a grave vault and
more impressive than the black skull of death.
Look at the scene.
Here, in the first circle, the most elegantly
dressed men, the most beautiful women,
whose silken garments glow in the dazzling
light, as their lovely faces are turned toward
the stage; whose eyes outsparkle the jewels
on their heaving breasts, and all the while,
right before those sparkling eyes, in the
over-flowing
pit, you see the hardy sons of toil
mingled with the ragged vagabonds of the
good Quaker City.
And all the while, in sight of those
sparkling
eyes, in full view of those grave mothers
and beautiful wives and sinless sisters, you
behold
the third tier festering with the painted
prostitution of the good Quaker City!
Delicate contrasts these.
What is the sight that enchains the gaze
of the sinless girl and the painted outcast of
shame? That rivets the eye of yonder
white-haired
man in the first tier and the ragged
boy in the pit, right before him, within reach
of his golden-headed cane? On what vision
of moral or intellectual beauty is centered
those thousand eyes, flashing and sparkling
in the red gas light?
A half-naked woman whirling over the
stage, her form clothed in flesh-colored hose
that clings to the skin, a piece of white gauze
fluttering from her waist, her arms and bosom
bare! A half-naked woman, whirling over
the stage, now standing on one limb, while
the other is poised in the air, on a line with
her shoulder; now trembling along on tip-toe,
as in the ecstacy of lascivious frenzy; now
crouching near the foot-lights, her head
bowed
until her naked breast is revealed to the
universal gazeto the eyes of the sinless girl
the painted outcast, the old man and the
ragged
boy.
This is the sight which rivets the gaze of
the crowded theatre.a woman floating aleng
the stage and trafficing her nakedness for
bread.
For her, the poor moth of the foot-lights,
now fluttering in their glare only to be the
more surely withered in ther blaze, there is
some excuse. It is her livelihoodperchance
the head of an aged mother, nay, the life of a
sister, depends on her dancing limbs. Every
twirl of her naked limb is one tear less on her
dying sister's cheeks.
But for these beautiful women, these
grey-haired
men, who, in the presence of the
painted
prostitute and the ragged outcast boy, gaze
on this spectacle with trembling delight, what
is their excuse?
Come, I do not place it on the ground of
religion or morality, but mereiy as a matter
of common decencydecency so common
that it can only raise one blush and dieI
ask you, my reader, whether the world can
furnish a sight of more disgusting and
heart-rending
shame than this?
A half-naked woman showing her limbs for
bread to feed a sick mother or dying sister,
perchance, while grey-haired men look on
and gloat; and beautiful women, made by
the same God who made the dancing woman
going down to the same grave-worm, which
will feed on her formgaze on their sister's
shame and do not blush.
Do not charge me with a prejudice against
the Drama. That miserably prostituted
drama
may be made the voice of genius, the
music of religion.
But these half-naked women on the stage,
tossing in lascivious transport; these painted
ones in the third tier, bargaining in pollution,
while their pure sisters may look on and up,
from the Aristocratic circlethese elegantly
decorated bars, where drunkards are
educated
and poison soldwill you tell me what
all this has to do with a pure and intellectual
drama?
Must William Shakspeare forever be made
the cloak of loathsome appetites and
nameless
pollutions?
It was in the Walnut-street theatre. The
curtain had fallen and the dancing woman
was gone. The ragged boys were fighting in
the pit; the traffic of shame was going on in
the third tier. In boxes, handsome women
were conversing with fashionably attired men,
and here and there a puppy, with something
like a human face, dressed, at all events, in
the garments of a man, was staring those
modest women out of countenance, and
fastening
its obscene gaze upon the face of the
pure maiden or the virtuous wife. Of all
puppies in the world, the most impertinent is
the puppy of the theatre, with an opera-glass
in its hand.
It was in the midst of this confusion,
between
the acts, that two persons entered the
central box, and at once rivetted every eye.
A tall man, attired in plain black, with the
slight form of a woman, supported by his
right arm.
They quietly took the unoccupied seat, and
as if by an instantaneous impulse, the
thousand
eyes of the theatre were turned upon
them.
The man was
, or appeared to be, some
thirty five years of age. There was nothing
peculiar in his dress. Black dress coat and
satin vest, black neckerchief, loosely tied, a
faultlessly white shirt bosom, sparkling with
a small diamond. Yet his face enchained
every eye by a kind of irresistible
fascination
.
The features were bold, his complexion, a
pallid sallow olive, indicating the traces of
strong physical or mental suffering, and the
eyes, so unnaturally large and dark, seemed
not so much to gleam as to burn in their
sockets. There was no moustache upon his
lip nor beard upon his chin, but masses of
dark hair fell carelessly over a bold, white
forehead.
He leaned his elbow on the edge of the
box, and gazed upon the curtain with a
vacant
stare.
By his side the slight form of a woman,
whose face appeared among the folds of a
Spanish mantilla. The dark hues of the
graceful robe gave an unnatural paleness to
the colorless cheek, and increased the burning
light of her large black eyes, which shone
from the shadow of their long and quivering
lashes.
As she raised her hand to adjust the folds
of her mantilla, a bracelet was visible,
dazzling
with the radiance of a solitary
diamond
.
Altogether, the pair would have attracted
the eye in any place, and became at once, in
the street, ball-room or parlor, the universal
topic of conversation.
In the theatre the sensation was universal.
eyes were turned, glasses levelled; the house
buzzed with a thousand whispers.
`They are the strangers who have
attracted
so much notice in Chesnut-street lately.'
`He is very, very richa millionaire.'
`No; a soldier from the Mexican war.'
`I tell you that I have the right story,
a Mexican General taken prisoner at Cerro
Gordo.'
`How odd! That mantillabad taste.'
`I rather like it. It gives quite a charm to
her face.'
`What a splendid bracelet I'
`Do you observe that diamond upon his
bosom?'
Whispers like these from fair ladies and
fashionable men created a buz-buz murmur
in the dress circle. The third tier was
somewhat
eloquent in its remarks, rather too much
so; the second tier quite boisterous; and as
for the pit, it seemed to hesitate between a
cry of `boots!' and chuck 'em over!'
A single instance will serve as an
illustration
of the public opinion of the pit,
`I say, hoss,' screamed a ragged newsboy,
raising himself on his toes, as he stood
within
reach of the stranger's arm, only separated
by that barrier which confines the whirlpool
of the pit within its limits; `wot did yer giv'
for that ar' di'mond? Jimini, boys, wot a
scorcher!'
Still the stranger, with his cheek resting on
his hand, stared vacantly upon the drop
curtain
.
Not a movement manifested his
consciousness
that the eyes and impertinence of
the theatre were turned upon him and the
lady at his side.
The lady seemed surprised, her cheek
flushed, her dark eyes dropped their glance.
But the mantilla, which half-concealed her
smooth black hair, and floated over the
outline
of her small but lovely form, could not be
forgiven.
It was an unpardonable sin, in a
Philadelphia
theatre, where everybody must dress
like everybody else, or be pointed at and `put
down.'
`How odd!' trembled all over the dress
circle.
At last the lady whispered a word in
Spanish,
`Juan!'
He turned and gazed upon her with a look
whose mingled meaning it were in vain to
guess, and exclaimed with an evident
effort
,
`You seem melancholy, Isora? In a
moment
the curtain will raise and the play
begin
.
It is indeed a very dull place, a
crowded
theatre.'
He leaned back in his seat, and the lady,
with a single red spot glowing on each cheek,
murmured in almost inaudible tones, still
speaking in Spanish, you will remember.
`But the
letter
, Juan?'
A sudden, nervous start shook the
stranger's
frame. He turned quickly, as though
he had been bitten by an adder; a cloud
rushed
over his brow.
Mastering his agitation he composed his
pale features in a smile,
`I cannot show it to you now, Isora. It is
postmarked New Orleans. Your brother is
now in that city; he is on his way to
Philadelphia
he
will be here in a few days.'
How her face flushed from its sad hue into
a rosy life.
`Oh, I am so happy, Juan! He will be
here in a few days; he has forgiven his
wayward
sister for her wanderingshe will be
your friend, Juan. Is it not so? Blessed
Virgin! we will all be so happy!'
Juan smiled; and then his eye flashed, his
brow was corrugated, the expression of his
sallow face was horribleit passed like a
cloudhe smiled again.
`This letter, Juan, is from my brother?'
Again he started, once more that
expression
,
and then the calm smile,
`No more now, Isora, when we return
home I will tell you all. For the present,
your brother, Don Antonio Marin, will be here
to-morrowperchance to-night.'
He said no more, but while the curtain
rose and the play went on, and the audience
laughed, and hissed, and stamped, he sat with
his cheek upon his hand, his large eyes fixed
upon the stage with an absent stare.
It cannot be denied that his face was in
vested with a cold, pallid beauty; the firm,
aquiline features stood out in the glaring
light, like the head of an antique statue,
darkened
by the dust of ages. Yet never once,
during all the play, did he turn from side to
side, or change his fixed, unvarying glance,
though Forrest was on the stage and the play
was Richlieu.Forrest and Richlieu after
the shameless display of a half-naked
woman's
limbs!
The play was over, and the audience,
pouring from the various boxes of the
theatre
,
swarmed through the outer corridor, and
swept like a torrent into the street.
Amid the crowd descending the stone steps
in front of the theatre, the form of Juan and
the lady were marked, prominent; his head
rising above the crowd, her mantilla
contrasting
with the rainbow dress of the other
women
.
The other women! Yescourtezan and
fine lady mingled together in the crowd that
poured from the doors of the theatre, and the
flaming gas-lamp on the pavement disclosed,
with impartial light, the face of the sinless
girl and the painted visage of her
sister-woman
,
the child of shame.
Suddenly, even as Juan and Isora were
descending
the steps, a cry was heard; the
crowd rocked to and froa strange wave of
human facesand universal clamor and
confusion
tossed the strongly contrasted mass
together
.
It was shouted that the stranger had been
robbed, his pocket-book stolen; four or five
men, with red faces and noses of
extraordinary
development, were seen rushing
toward
him, making with their fists an
extemporaneous
lane through the centre of the
crowd.
They were known at once as Police
Officers
.
`I say, Mister,' cried the foremost, a rotund
man, on whose rich-colored visage brandy
had not been showered for nothing; `I saw
the fellow hook your pocket-bookwill know
him agin. What's the figur? Damage very
ser'ous?'
Juan bent his lips to the ear of the
red-faced
man, as his brow manifested deep
vexation
and chagrin,
`Five thousand dollars were in that
pocket-book
;
if you reclaim it by to-morrow
morning
without touching the papers which it
contains
,
one thousand shall be yours.'
`Won't I! Why I've had my eye on the
feller these three weeks and know'd he was
up to mischief. Your residence, sir? The
pocket book 'ill be in your hands before nine
o'clock to-morrow morning!'
`Enough! We understand each other.
Here is my card;' and supporting Isora with
his arm, he pushed down the steps, and
presently
stood on the edge of the pavement,
where stood a glittering carriage with a coat
of arms on the panels; a liveried footman
holding the open door, and a coachman, also
in livery, snoring on the box.
`Rather aristocratic!' murmured voices
from the crowd.
`Splendid turn out!'
`Just look at them blooded baysand that
darkey, with one eye and a blue coat!'
`Isora, you will enter and go home alone!
Urgent business demands my presence
elsewhere
,
for an hour or more. Nay, do not
look so reproachful.'
From the folds of the mantilla her pale face
appeared, as her lustrous eyes were raised to
meet his glance.
Her delicate foot was upon the carriage
stepher hand upon the door.
`The letter, Juan?'
It was but a whisper and yet her bosom
heaved as she spoke the words.
`Within two hours I will return home and
tell you all!'
He lifted her gently into the carriage,
closed the door and spoke to the lacqueys.
In a moment the couch was seen dashing
away through the hacks and cabs that lined
the street.
Juan turned up Ninth-street, murmuring
as the hurried along,
`She fades every hourI can see her fade
withering, drooping into the grave. `My
brother!' her only word, from hour to hour,
She dreams, even now, that I have gone to
bring
him
home!'
At the corner of Ninth and George streets,
in the shadow of that immense pile known as
the Museum, a dark horse stood saddled, the
bridle held by a liveried servant. Juan spoke
to the servant, and with a bound sprang into
the saddle and dashed away, as though his
own spirit had maddened the veins of his
horse.
Up Ninth street, into the Ridge Road, and
out into the country.
It was a gloomy night in May; the air was
damp and misty; the sky one mass of leaden
cloud.
Along the dark roadthe trees on either
side appearing like a shapeless mass
bounded
the horse, striking fire with his hoofs as he
flew, while his master applied the spur and
chafed and maddened him to the utmost
stretch of his speed.
Through the misty atmosphere, a huge
white mass arose; looking somewhat like a
mountain of snow, shapen by superhuman
hands into the form of a Grecian temple. It
was a magnificent sight, that College of
Girard
,
looming through the misty night, but
Juan did not see it.
His head upon his breast, his dark eyes
glaring straight ahead, he kept his mettled
horse at the same arrow-like speed, and soon
left the college three miles behind.
Down the steep hill, into the hollow, where
an old tavern standssomewhat retired from
the road - its lonely sign creaking on
rheumatic
hinges.
A light shone out upon the porch as the
foaming horse, bounding aside from the road,
attracted by the echo of his hoofs, the tavern
keeper, lantern in hand, came to the door.
`I wish you to take care of my horse for
an hour or so,' said Juan, as he bounded from
the saddle upon the road.
The sleepy host rubbed his eyes and
surveyed
the stranger, with as much amazement as
though he hid been rained from the clouds.
`You don't live here about, it may be?' he
drawled. `Hello! He's gone. Don't much
like himvery pucooliar eyes! Not a bad
horse, though!'
While the tavern keeper stood wondering,
Juan had crossed the road, leaped the wicket
fence, and was now threading a westward
path that led along a broad and gently
undulating
meadow.
In the day-iime, when the bees fill the air
with their music, this meadow is very
beautiful
a
broad mantle of trembling green
stretched in sight of the dusty road. But now
there was a mist upon it; a floating shroud
hung over its gentle undulations and veiled its
moist verdure.
Soon the path terminated, and before the
wanderer rolled the Schuylkill, its beautiful
hills and picturesque bridges and island of
glorious foliage, all shrouded by that misty
veil.
To the north over those rude cliffs and
down into the wilderness where the herbage
and trees are locked in one woven mass of
leaves and flowers. Up the steep rock that
rises like a wall, stone heaped on stone, and
mass piled on mass, with vines twining all
about itlike little children around a harsh
old warriorand saplings starting from every
cleft, then exuberant foliage clothing the
granite heap with a girdle of summer green.
The wanderer stands upon the summit and
feels the night breeze from the river on his
hot brow, and sees the mist gliding among
the trees and over the graves of Laurel Hill.
CHAPTER XV.
LAUREL HILL.
`Two coffins in that solitary vault  two
only.
Texan MSS
.
Laurel Hill
! Did you ever see it by
day-light
on
a Sabbath day, when the crowd,
who come hero to gape about the graves, are
locked outon a Sabbath day in June, when
everything was silent, save the bees, and all
things motionless as death, save, the gentle
blossoms, trembling above the grass.
It is very beautiful then, with its white
monuments and winding walks, its high wall
and entrance gate, shutting out the hot, dusty
road; its chapel, with stained windows, where
prayer is said before the coffin is laid away,
in the dismal vault, or planted in the fresh,
smoking earth; altogether a place of perfume,
bees and flowers, graves burthened with
sculpture and marbles rich in epitaphs.
Yet I like it not. It looks to me, with its
dainty monuments burdened with flowers, like
an attempt to be elegant with Death, and
decorate his fleshless skull with the ribbons
and millinery of the fashionable world.
There is too much mockery, too much
mimicry of woe, in this elegant cemetry. Too
much of
`Here lies my husband
Jean
,
Whose affectionate widow still sells ribbons
and laces,
At the old stand,
No. 29,
Rue Jacconot
.'
*
*
An epitaph something like this, is recorded on
a marble pile in the great cemetly, near Paris.
Give me an old graveyard, where the
graves are hidden among tall grass and wild
flowers, where the tombstones peep modestly
above the blossoms and the verdure, and a
holy air of repose, as if from God, imbues
the place where dead people sleep, and brings
sweet messages of immortality home to the
soul.
But these fashionable cemetrys, Mount
Auburn
,
Greenwood and Laurel Hill. Could
you not, my dear friends, keep Fashion in
your ball rooms, and leave the grave as it
was in the days of our fathers, a holy altar,
where none came to look save those who had
friends among the dead?
`Come boys, we've had our dinner and our
wine at the United States Hotellobster and
champaigne, and all the et ceteraslet's take
a cap and go out to Laurel Hill and have a
jovial chat as we smoke our cigars amongst
the graves!'
Does that sound very sweet? Think of a
mother, or a sister, or a wife, sleeping in the
sod, while a party of half-drunken dandies
stroll over their graves, venting their obscene
souls in jests that taint the very air. I have
even seen one of those wretched manikins,
from Chestnut street, whom the tailor makes,
stand on Laurel Hill, plying his opera glass
among the homes of death.
Laurel Hill is beautiful without all this
garniture of sculpture and millinery of fashion
it was beautiful long ago, before they made
it a `fashionable cemetry.'
Down by the river where the trees grew
thickest, dipping their leaves in the waters,
and the bank arises, rugged with huge old
forms of rock, there is many a solemn walk
among the quiet nooks shrouded in foliage,
or over the steeps shaded by the sighing pine.
The sunlight comes in stray gleams, and
through the trees the river glimpses on the
sight. Gloomily in the shadows the dark
vaults are seen, their iron doors sunken in the
clefts of the rocks, while, overhead, a leafy
canopy waves like a pall.
It was down among these haunts of gloom
that the wanderer bent his steps at dead of
night.
No sunlight now upon the vaults, no gleam
of moon or star to light, with a solitary ray,
those paths leading to the river, those
wind-winding
ways that climb the granite rocks.
Like the spirits of the dead, the mist glides
about the rocks, and windsso white and
coldamong the trunks of the centuried
trees.
Juan paused before an iron door, sunken
beneath a mass of rock, with a pine tree
shooting
away from the sod in front of it. He
took from his breast a key, and the harsh
sound of the yielding lock echoed like a shriek
through the silence.
He advanced, and in the very air rushing
from the charnel, felt that death was there.
Closing the door he stood in the darkness of
the vault; a horrible intense darkness that
seemed to shut him in its stifling folds and
bind him like a cloak.
Silence, darkness, thought!
With a phosphorescent match he produced
a blue and vivid light which glared at once
upon the darkness, disclosing the narrow
walls of the vault and shining upon those
coffinsthere are twoplaced side by side on
the floor.
That blueish light burned for a moment,
glittered on the silver plate upon each coffin's
breast, and went out.
The darkness was more horrible from the
glare of that sudden, phosphorescent ray.
That ray revealed the features of Juan,
working with fearful agony, and revealed
the names inscribed upon the coffins.
These were the names, glaring for a
moment
and then gone,
`
Isabel
.'
`
Don Antonio Marin
.'
For the first time the Wanderer spoke,
`I was in the room when John Randolph
died, and saw him trace upon a card, with his
skinny finger, a single word`Remorse'
and saw him die, with his eye glazing as he
gloated on it. That word I never knew what
it meant till now.'
He was silent; there was no light to show
the hideous writhing of his face.
`Isabel! Isabel! You answer me not,
for you are cold and deadthe worms upon
your brow, the shroud upon your breast
dead. You who shone so beautiful in the
Home of Prairie Eden.
`Isabel, when you were dying you told me
that `there had been too much blood shed,'
too much even for the hideous ruin which the
betrayer worked for you. You besought me
to bring his body from the vaults of
Sacrificios
and lay it by your side, to show that you
forgave him even in death. I have obeyed,
to-day Don Antonio arrivedhe is here, my
sister; by your side, and I, your brother, feel
remorse
for the revenge which I hurled on his
dying hour
remorse
.'
Silence and thought.
`Speak to me Isabel, tell me, is there a
hope for me beyondthere, across the black
grave? Speak, is there one hope? Isabel,
here, beside your coffin, in the cold, dark
vault I kneel, and repeat your dying words,
The blessed God forgave his murderers even
on the Cross!
John, there has been too
much bloodshedtoo much too much. `
Vengeance
is mine, and I will repay,' was spoken
by God himself, and we, John, have taken
from God his own time and manner of justice
we have done much wrong; let us now
forgive
.
`I see your dying eyes, my sister, and hear
your voice,
For forgiveness is such a beautiful
blossom
to bloom upon our shrouds when we
are dead.
A pause once moresobstears.
Let us forgive, and make such
recompense
for our wrong as is in the power of
man to make. Be kind, very kind to Isora
let her never know her brother's fate. Bring
hither his body and let let it be plaeed
beside
mine when I am dead, in token, that
after much wrong and horrible crimes, we
sleep in death together, and sleep in
forgiveness'
`These words on your lips, you fell back
and grew cold in my arms.'
A sound as of a strong heart breaking in
agony
`I kneel, Isabel; I place my hand upon his
coffinIIOh God!
I forgive him!
'
Again the silence of Death upon the dark
vault.
`Behold me, Isabel! My Free Rangers,
those outcasts of the land and sea, no longer
know that their leader lives. I am alone.
There is no living breast into whose recesses
I may pour the agony of my soulmay pour
my horrible secret and my remorse. For
Isoraoh God! she is dyingevery moment
she dies before my face. I cannot tell her
that it was her brother whom she cursed in the
vaults of Sacrificiosno, no! I come to you
speak to melet me know whether beyond
this dark grave there is a hope, whether there
is one star in the midnight sky of death?'
And shaken from the proud might of his
vengeance, the strong man grovelled beside
the coffins, and laid his brow upon the slimy
floor of the vault.
`
Remorse!
'
CHAPTER XVI.
THE PERISHING HEATHEN OF PHILADELPHIA.
`Ten thousand in a Protestant city, who have
no church, no Bible, no God.
Texan MSS
.
One
night, not long ago, I stood in a crowded
church and saw three missionaries
consecrated
for a great work. They were about to
cross the globe and preach the gospel to the
poor of Hindostan. To aid them in this work
some thousands of dollars were showered upon
the altar; nay, beautiful women tore the
bracelets from their wrists, the pearls from
their bosoms, and said,
`Take these and carry the Gospel to the
perishing heathen.'
Within a stone's throw of that magnificent
church, at the same hour, there occurred a
scene of somewhat different kind.
Behold
it.
Leaving the church we will enter this
narrow
alley which branches from the main
street. In this narrow alley, the only light
that shines is from the dingy windows of the
Rum-shop. In this narrow alley, at least one
hundred houses or huts are huddled together,
some of frame, others of brick, all with their
windows stuffed with rags.
These houses yield a handsome rent to
their owners. You imagine that one family
of three or four persons occupies each
house?
You don't knew Philadelphia. That is
evident
.
Let me show you how a single room in
one of these hutsthat one next the tenth
rum-shopis occupied.
Through the narrow door, into this room
with low ceiling, black walls, and floor some
twelve feet square. What have we here? By
the light of a penny candle, stuck in a porter
bottle, you may behold the scene.
Close to the wall, side by side, their knees
drawn up to their chins, are crouched at least
twenty human beings, from the half-naked
girl of fifteen to the old man of eighty; here
the mother, with a baby on her breast, there
the negro, with his rum bottle, and along the
square formed by their huddled forms, you
see everything that is miserable in nakedness,
disease and rags.
These are the rum-shop keeper's lodgers,
but not all.
All day long they prowl the street, picking
rags, or begging cold victuals, or stealing a
morsel, and at night, they repose here for one
cent a head.
The porter bottle, which illuminates the
room, is held by a huge negro, who, with
rags upon his chest, is playing cards with a
white woman, who also crouches upon the
floor.
As the greasy pack passes from the white
hand to the black hand, you see a woman
only a miserable rag upon her form
stretched
stiffly out in the centre of the room, her
bosom, and arms, and limbs disclosed by the
light.
That bosom is wasted, those arms shrunken
to the bone. As for the face, you cannot see
it, for her black hair, streaked with grey, falls
over it.
Does she sleep?
Lift the hair from her face and behold
those stony eyeballs. She sleepsand sleeps
all the better that she has had no bread for
three days.
My good Missionary friend permit me to
take you by the bow of your white cravat,
and lead you from the crowded church into
this roomand don't think me impertinen
when I tell you, that the Lord Jesus will smile
more blessedly upon you if you sell one or
more of your handsomely bound Bibles and
buy a little bread, a little shelter for these
heathens of Philadelphia.
Excuse my freedom, friend; I have an odd
way of saying things, but as there is a God,
you need not go all the way to Hindostan to
find perishing Christians.
The breath left her body an hour ago. She
is cold now.
The door opens; a boy, half-nakedfor
his only dress consists of trowsers that reach
to the knee, and a check shirt with one sleeve
a boy comes forward to the light. You see
his freckled face, concealed by a mass of
matted brown hair, from beneath whose
uneven
ends a pair of bright eyes gleam with
steady lustre.
He may be twelve years old, and he may
be fifteen; but in sober truth you cannot
guess his age from his face, for its lines are
sharpened into premature manhood, by a
course of severe study.
Poverty and starvation are great thinkers.
`Mother!'
He kneels beside the dead woman, and
places his lips to her ears,
`Mother, come! I have that which will
buy us bread.'
She does not answer himhe shakes her
gently by the armfeels that it is cold.
`Mother!' arose the shriek of that poor
wretch's agony. `You are so coldso
hungry
you
can't be
dead?
Comequick I
say.' He whispered the last words`
I have
money, mother; come!
'
The gambling negro turned from his
game,
`Look yer, young gemmen, ef you don't
stop yer dam noise, I'll break yer dam
jaw!'
The boy did not disturb the negro any
more. He felt his mother's hands and bosom
and knew that she was dead, and then went
out into the alley and leaned his face against
the wall, and his tears fell without a sound.
She was the only thing that cared for him
in the world; she was dead. The little boy
looked up to the misty sky and along the
alley
,
and wondered where he should go now?
The watchman from the neighboring street
yelled,`Two o'clock, and a cloudy mor'n,'
and a dead silence hung over the slumbering
city. Where could he go, that motherless
wretch?
Approaching the light which fell from the
rum shop window, over the gutter, the boy
drew from his rags a pocket book of dark
morocco
,
which he opened, and spread forth the
soft silken notes in his dirty hands.
`Moneyit must be moneyand I can't
readmother could have read 'em.
Mother
!'
His tears fell afresh, and he was turning
from the light when a rude hand pinned him
by the shoulder:
`Come, my larkey; I'll take care of that
money for you. O, your a precious one
ain't you! I say, Charley, give us the
`barkers;' we'll fix this lively youth so that
Judge Cant 'll be pleased to see him. A very
fine judge is Judge Cant; though he makes
temperance speeches on the bench, he can
take quite as big a brand-and-water as any
of us.'
The boy was surrounded by some half
dozen men, with red faces, well-developed
noses and flashy guard-chains.
They were dragging him along the alley,
with some force and a few kicks, when a
figure advanced from the shadows and
confronted
the party.
He had evidently been attracted from the
main street by the cries of the child.
`Hello! It's the gentleman that was
robbed
.
Well, sir, you see we've got him; we
follered him up, watched him and found the
property on his person.'
`Give me the pocket book,' said Juan, as
he gazed steadily in the face of the police
officer. `Here is your rewardone thousand
dollars. Now, what will you do with this
poor boy?'
`O, as for him, Judge Cant 'ill fix him.
Nothin' pleases Judge Cant so much as to
get hold of a young shaver. Oh my! doesn't
he give 'em fits!'
Juan, or John of Prairie Eden, as you
please, drew near the scared and sobbing
child, and swept back the matted hair from
his forehead.
`Have you a name, my little fellow?'
`Never had a name. The boys calls me
Young Rags, an' my father's gone away, an'
my mother's dead, an' them men have been
a kickin of me.'
Blurting his many sorrows in a breath, he
rubbed his fists in his eyes, and sobbed as
though his heart had broken.
`If you want to know anything about him,'
said the Police officer with the reddest nose,
`I kin tell you, for I've had my eye upon his
mother and father for this five years past.
His father 'listed this spring in the Navy and
haint been heered on since. He was a poor
devil enough, but once was rayther
respectable
,
that is afore he first left the city, some
years back, with the runaway Bank Director.
You see McGregor was once this Bank
Director's
clark'
`McGregor!'
John started as he echoed the word.
`Y-a-s, Ewen McGregor.'
`Ewen McGregor!' John whispered as he
took the boy by the hand. `Prove this to me,
and I'll make your information worth money
to you.'
His voice was tremulous; he laid his hands
on the police officer's arm.
`Prove it!Why we all know it. You see
McGregor went away to Texas, then jined
the Mexican army, and last winter came back
to town a poor, miserable devil, without one
cent to rub against another. He found his
wife, whom he'd deserted years before, in a
`bad place'you take, eh?an jined the
American Navy, an' hai'nt been heerd on
since.'
`That wife?'
`About an hour ago, when we first set our
watch in the alley to catch this shaver, we
found her dead in yonder hole. Guess she
atn't got alive sence.ha, ha!'
`Come! show me where your mother lies
dead.'
The ragged boy looked up into those large
dark eyes, saw them filled with tears, and
took the stranger's hand.
`Come, I'll show you. Ye see I was
hungry
and mother was cold'
But John of Prairie Eden did not wait for
the boy to finish his incoherent ejaculations.
The police officers with some, wonder and
a few extra-judicial oaths, beheld that tall
stranger, disappear in the shadows, led by
the child to the dark hut where lay his mother's
corse.
Into the hut, where the negro holds the
light, and thumbs the greasy cards.
John bent down, lifted the black hair,
sprinkled with grey, beheld the wasted face
and stony eyes.
Years before he had known her, so young
and beautiful. Even amid the wreck made
by starvation and disease, he knew her, and
traced the outlines of what she
had been
in
the withered thing which lay before him stiff
and cold.
`You see, we hadn't any bread;' the boy
whimpered. `That is, mother hadn't; for
what she could git she give me; an' I
watched
by the theatre, an''
John took the little outcast by the hand:
`Come home with me. While I have one
crust left you shall never want.'
CHAPTER XVII.
Day
is breaking in the East, and the morning
mists glide like phantoms over the broad
Delaware
.
The grey light of the dawn steals
through the curtains of the chamber,
struggling
with the beams of the lamp which
stands near the bed on yonder table.
A sad sight awaits us.
True, the chamber is luxuriously
furnished
:
the richly papered walls bloom with the
warm creations of the artist's thought; the
curtains of the high windows are of satin and
gold; the carpet from the looms of Smyrna;
the bed itself with hangings of white satin and
pillows of down, presents an image of
voluptuous
repose; it is imbued with an atmosphere
of luxury and quiet splendor, and yet another
atmosphere is stealing slowly into the place,
and covering all things with its vague,
chilling
mist.
It is the atmosphere of Death.
Beside the bedthe damps of Laurell Hill
yet fresh upon his attireis John of Prairie
Eden, his face wearing a dead stupor, an
apathy
of despair, which blunts its well defined
outlines, and covers his eyes as with a glossy
film.
The sorrow is too crushing for him to feel
it now. He cannot feel it, cannot believe,
the air seems but a mass of whirling
phantoms
;
it is not reality, but a dream.
A dream; and yet to-morrow.
Isora lies upon the snowy coverlet of that
bed. Her form but half-clad, she rests with
her hands folded, her white bosom gleaming
ing the light, her eyes closed, the fringes
reposing
on the colorless cheek, her hair
descending
over her shoulders, and resting in
glossy curls upon her arms.
Does she breathe? Ah, the bosom seems
pulseless, cold.
A faint trembling of the lower lip, alone
attests
that the soul is quivering there, ere it
departs forever.
So gently she dies, that it but seems like
gliding into a pleasant sleep. So softly passes
her soul away, that it seems a lilly torn from
its stem and cast upon a smooth lake that
bears it tenderly upon its breast and ripples in
low music round it as it floats along.
At last her lids unclose; how black, how
flashing, how beauliful those death-dewed
eyes.
`Juan!'
She knew him and reached forth her hand.
He took it, pressed it to his lips and
bosom
;
it was wet with moisture from the kiss
of Death.
`Juan, I am going. Ever since the day
when the rite of the church blessed our union
I have felt a burning here'
He laid her little hand upon her naked
bosom
.
`Last night, when I came home, I laid me
down to sleep, and felt that in that sleep, my
soul was going fast away; yet I could not,
until now unclose my eyes, or manifest by any
sign I knew you were here. I heard your
groans, Juan, your prayers, I felt your tears
upon my cheek, but could not speak to you.
A few moments now are given to me, and
let me lay my head upon your breast, and
wind my arms about your neck, and die. My
heart shall beat against yours when it flutters
its last; my last breath mingle with your kiss.
I am so happy, so much peace! Do not
weep, Juan; there is a bright angel at the
foot of toe bed, who lifts his white wings and
says, `Come!'
He had taken her to his breast and wound
her arms about his neckah! they were so
cold!and covered his eyes with her silken
hair. But he could not speak.
`When you see my brother, for he will
come, Juantell him that I spoke of him to
the last, and died so happy because I knew
that he had forgiven me! Tell himah!
Juan, my arms are cold, I cannot move my
fingers. Is it dark, Juan, or have my eyes
been covered by a veil?'
Over his shoulder she raised her head,
glaring around with her large, deep eyes.
They were glassya misty film shrouded
their dazzling brightness.
How her slight form rocked as his broad
chest heaved, and struggled, and fell, with the
overwhelming agony of that hour. Yet he
spoke not, but grasping her hair, swept its
glossy masses over his eyes, and wept aloud.
`It is dark, JuanI cannot see you. Holy
Virgin! Mary, Mother of God, pity and
forgive
me, a weak, weak child! Closer, Juan,
kiss me. Ice upon my heart, Juan, ice; but
I can feel your lips; your breath warms my
cheek; My brother, Juan, tell himah!
the white angel lifts his wingsI see him now
It is light again!
Come! come!'
A trembling flutter of the lips, and the
white angel has borne a spirit home.
Those icy arms are round his neck, that
icy breast against his own; the glassy eyes,
how cold, how dead they glare; the lips that
are pressed to his, are chilled and colorless
forever.
Still he tries to dry the tears with the soft
masses of her silken hair and kisses her cold
lips, as if to win back the departed soul.
Little did the proud, revengeful man
imagine
this hour, when in her home of Vera
Cruz, he cruelly planned her shame. That he
should ever weep hot, scalding tears for the
sister of Don Antonio; that he should love
her better than life, or what to the proud heart
is worth all, revenge; and press her dead
breast to his heart, and drench her silken hair
with the baptism of her agony.
May be some white angel had changed his
breast, and turned the blight of his revenge
into a blessing fresh from God.
She died, the victim of a rapid and
imperceptible
decay, but died without knowing that
her brother was the writhing wretch of the
Aztec vanlt of Sacrificios; the Destroyer o
Prairie Eden, its beautiful maiden, white
haired old man and blue-eyed boy.
For that ignorance which hailed her dying
hour, let us bless the white angel, who lifted
its wings as she grew cold and whispered
`Come!'
THE END.The Chief of the Free Rangers
.
Isle of Sacrificios,
March 9th, 1847.
It was an interesting thing to observe the
face and form of this escaped sailor, while he
stood by the torch, engaged in deciphering
the somewhat mysterious epistle which we
have given above.
The light streamed over his red hair and
beard, disclosing the sinews of his gigantic
chest, and revealing his broad back, with the
blood oozing slowly from its welts and
sores.
At first his countenance wore a gloomy
scowl,
`I have been fooled,' he murmured, with a
blasphemous oath, and tossed the paper to
the ground.
`Ha! what is this?' he cried, as he beheld
a piece of paper, some ten inches square,
affixed
to the wall by a knife,Beyond the
eastern idol lies your way; pursue it in
darkness
for some hundred paces, descend a
stairway
,
and await further orders from the
C. F. R.'
