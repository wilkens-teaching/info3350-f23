MEMOIRS OF A PREACHER.
PART TWO. THE SEQUEL.
CHAPTER FIRST.
SQUASHAHOGANY.
At this moment let us change the scene.
Passing through the thick walls which divide
the rooms of Brother Caleb's house, let us
enter yonder large chamber, on the first floor,
where the light of wax candles falls upon the
faces of Brother Caleb and his midnight
guests.
After a while we will trace the fate of poor
Ralph, whom we left hanging on the lattice,
with the tin box under his arm.
For the present our history calls us to the
large chamber on the first floor  the
chamber
which is connected by folding doors, with
the room described by Fanny, in her Magnetic
Revelation.
A single thought should be borne in mind,
while you peruse the scene which follows.
Do not blame us, if you discover that our
description
of the personal appearance of these
thirty guests, is vague and sketch-like. We
dare not paint their portraits at full length.
We should be charged with the use of undue
personalities. A hundred gentlemen in Third,
in Chesnut, and in Market streets, would swear
that these thirty guests, so lightly outlined,
were intended as their own personal portraits.
Lift the curtain then, and let us take a hasty
glance at Brother Caleb and his guests.
Brother Caleb sat at the head of the table,
stark and grim in his blue coat and snow-white
vest. One hand grasping a pen, rested upon a
parchment, near an ink-stand. The other held
a long necked glass, glittering with
amber-colored
wine.
And Brother Caleb's protruding eyes, lighted
with faint lustre, as he surveyed the faces of
his midnight guests. Twenty or thirty
persons
were there, seated in black mahogany
chairs, around a table, covered with a white
cloth. And every hand grasped a glass, and
near every glass  starting blackly from the
white cloth  stood a long-necked bottle,
which bore the magic words
Cordon Bleu
.
The orgie drew near its close. The feast
was over. The plates of massive gold glittered
on the side-board in one corner, amid the
broken fragments of the feast. That midnight
festival, in which the guests ate, drank, and
were merry, without the presence of a single
servant, had now attained the period when
lights become double, and walls go spinning
round.
What do you think of this plan? said
Brother Caleb, and his eyes ran along the line
of wax lights, which shone dimly upon the
faces of his guests.
Capital, said Dicky Bung, making a
desperate
effort to fill his glass.
Good, very good, said the lean Quaker,
trying to look steadily at the candle before
him.
Excels everything of the kind, said a prim
citizen, with demure face and neatly curled
hair  The Grand Subterranean
Squashahogany
Copper Mining Company! Here's
to the President, Caleb Goodleigh, Esquire,
and here's to the thirty original stockholders!
And the very respectable gentleman emptied
his glass, and arranged his shirt collar, which
was very high and white and stiff.
It's good  good I say, said a pompous
gentleman with red whiskers, and scarlet face:
It'll go ahead o' Multicaulis!'
Sooth to say, the corpulent gentleman was
very drunk. He made a well-intentioned effort
to pour out the candle, and drink from the
silver candle-stick, and then, as if conscious
that something was wrong, gazed sleepily about
him with leaden eyes.
And thus the midnight guests spoke out, one
by one, or in chorus, concerning the Grand
Subterranean Squashahogany Copper Mining
Company, until it was the turn of the last
person
at the end of the table. That last person
was a jocund dame, dressed in the heighth of
fashion  with a kind of matronly coquetry
about her  and with a small white hand,
glittering with rings, which kept up a perpetual
motion between her bottle and her glass. Her
eyes grew brighter as she suffered the
champagne
to glide over her lips, but her voice was
clear and sweet, and even as a bell.
What do you think of the plan, Mrs.
North? asked Brother Caleb, from the head
of the table.
We have discussed it so long, that I am
really sick of the subject. Our names are
signed; that is sufficient. We will make
money. What those who come into the
company
after us will make, is another question.
By the bye, Mr. Goodleigh, I would like to
resume
that little argument with you, concerning
a First Cause. Do you really believe in a
First Cause? You remember the remark of
Baron Holbach
Mrs. North's white teeth smiled between
her red lips, as the amber-colored liquor glided
down her throat. Mrs. North was a widow,
a lady of property, and a Philosopher. Some
people were so queer as to believe in a God
as for her own part, she couldn't. Mrs.
North was a learned woman.
I will not argue with you, my dear
Madam, as to a First Cause, said Brother
Caleb, while his thin lips were agitated by a
smile  But you must not deny the existence
of a Devil. Any one conversant with mankind
(for your sake I will not add
woman
-kind)
must believe in a Devil at all events. By the
bye, where's Scissleby?
At this query a general clamor rose. The
name of Scissleby was shouted by twenty
voices at once. But no Scissleby appeared.
He was to puff our copper stock in his
paper, said Dicky Bung, with a hiccup
And now he's cut us! It isn't the fair
thing.
And twenty other voices said that it was not
the fair thing. The prim gentleman, the lean
Quaker, the rotund gentleman, and seventeen
others.
Here I am, said an unearthly voice from
under the table  Whatdo  you  want?
Copy, always copy? I say, is the Steamer
in?
Poor Scissleby! Prostrate beneath the
table, his long limbs entangled somewhere
under Bung's chair, his mind was roaming in
the fairy world of the Daily Copper. Even
amid the delirium of champagne he heard an
imaginary Devil crying for copy: with his
head swimming like a humming top, he still
had sense enough to ask the oft-repeated
question
Is the steamer in?
Good for Slinkum, remarked Bung, as
he spilled the contents of a glass over his blue
scarf: Make an item somebody for the Daily
Copper. `Drunk, but still attentive to
business
.
Who? Slinkum Scissleby.'
Scissleby groaned beneath the table.
What do you think of the plan, sir? said
Brother Caleb, turning to a portly gentleman
by his side  You are connected with the
police department of this great city. Of course
you have many opportunities of studying
human
nature. You can estimate the amount of
interest which the mass of people will take in
this scheme; you can measure the
Amount o' pop'lar gullability, said the
portly gentleman, whose red neckchief looked
pale beside his scarlet face: Why s-i-r-r, in
the course o' ten years exper'ence, I have
come to the conclusion that the Public is an
animal remarkable for the size of its throat,
and the magnitude of its swallow. Stands to
reason, sir, that a Public as swallows our
Poleese
system, must have a throat like Mount
Wesooveus in the polar regions, or my name
ain't Stewel Pydgeon, Esquire, 'Special P.
O.!
Stewel was slightly affected with the bottle;
very slightly. In his sober moments his
geography
was not of the most accurate character:
you might measure his phases of his inebriety
by that word Mount Vesuvius. When
quite sober he located it in the gulf of Mexico;
slightly elevated he placed it in the Polar
Regions
;
pretty far gone, and he spoke of it as a
celebrated volcano somewhere in Asia, or
Rooshe-a.
Here is the plan, murmured Brother
Caleb fixing his large blue eyes on the sheet
of parchment: And here are thirty names
each signed opposite from fifty to a hundred
shares. This will give us thirty thousand
dollars
to begin upon. We can commence
working
the mines with that. Can we friend?
The question was addressed to the prim
Quaker gentleman.
Even so, was the reply: Twenty-seven
of the present company will give thee their
checks for a $1000 each, to-morrow
morning
.
I'm to have a $1000 worth in it, as `Borer
General' 'afore the 'Legislature, interrupted
Bung: Stewel have the same for his services
as Puffer along the streets in Fildelfy; and
Slinkum, (now under the table,) ditto for his
services in the Daily Copper. Mind that. Us
three are on the free list.
Next week resumed the Quaker, thee
will buy the farm in New Jersey, where this
copper ore is located?
I am now in treaty for it, replied Brother
Caleb. The ground once bought, we can
issue Certificates of stock and
There are plenty of workmen, servant
girls and such like, who will invest their little
carnings in the `stock' of the grand
Squashahogany
Copper Mining Company. If the
Company
fails they will loose of course. If it
succeeds
,
we gain. Capital always does.
Really you are a philosopher, smiled
Brother Caleb  smiled all over his pyramidal
face, from his square chin to his flat crown
But there is no danger of failure. The ore
yields ninety per cent. Should you like to
see it?
A chorus of twenty voices, said Yes! and
Brother Caleb rose from his seat. His tall
lean form, attired in the blue coat and white vest,
was strongly relieved by the dark mahogany
of the folding doors at his back.
His singular face, with its hollow cheeks
and great blue eyes, protruding from their
sockets, attracted even the drunken gaze of the
midnight guests.
For a moment he surveyed the company,
who were gathered in that spacious and
luxurious
chamber. His thin lips were agitated by
a peculiar smile. The dull surface of his blue
eyes flashed with momentary light.
Indeed, my dear Goodleigh, laughed Mrs.
North from the end of the table: A poetical
mind would compare you at the present
moment
,
to Milton's Satan surveying his dupes
in Pandemonium  the lady seemed to lose
the thread of her thought, for without a
moment's
pause she continued; Ar'nt
they
so
very drunk.
Brother Caleb smiled pleasantly, uttered
some colloquial compliment, and then
exclaimed
in a voice that reached every ear:
That specimen of the Squashahogany
Copper
ore is up-stairs. I will bring it to you.
Excuse me for a single moment.
Twenty voices and more excused him, and
Brother Caleb opened the folding doors and
disappeared into the next room.
Copy! Steamer in, cried Scissleby from
beneath the table.
No sooner had the door closed behind the
tall form of Brother Caleb, than the thirty
original stockholders of the Squashanogany
Copper Mining Company commenced an
irregular
and whispering conversation, concerning
their mysterious President.
Rich as Crsus or Astor! said the prim
gentleman.
Where did he reside before he bought this
house? asked the Quaker.
A singular man, exclaimed the peculiarly
corpulent person near Mrs. North: Has rich
connections in Europe. Duke of Wellington
his second cousin.
Keeps good champagne, was the
emphatic
remark of Bung.
Tell the foreman to send up proof of the
leader, groaned Scissleby under the table.
What does thee think of friend Goodleigh,
friend Stewel? asked the Quaker, looking
across the table toward the Police Officer.
But the Police Officer had disappeared.
And as the champagne made the circuit of
the table the talented Mrs. North commenced
a general discussion upon some abstruse point
in Baron Holbach's System of Nature.
CHAPTER SECOND.
STEWEL AND CALEB.
Stepping across the threshold, Brother Caleb
closed the folding doors behind him, and
approached
a table on which a small lamp was
burning.
It was the large room, described in the
revelations
of the Entranced Girl.
The lamp emitted but a faint light, and the
apartment furnished with all the appointments
of wealth and luxury, looked vast and
cheerless
as the dim ray, flickered amid its splendid
gloom.
As Brother Caleb extended his hand to grasp
the lamp, his singular face was displayed in
strong light and deep shadow. What was the
nature of the thought which gave such a
marked expression to his lips and eyes?
I will get the copper ore, he soliloquized,
and
they
will bring me the gold dust.
Mister Goodleigh, I'm a Poleese Officer,
said a voice, and a hand was laid on Brother
Caleb's arm.
You may well imagine that this voice,
breaking
abruptly from the dead stillness, startled
even the firm nerves of Brother Caleb into a
tremor.
Hey? what! what! You here? he said,
as he turned and saw the full-moon face of
Stewel Pydgeon at his shoulder.
I'm a poleese offisser, I am, said Stewel
with emphasis: Don't you remember
something
about a
tin box?
Brother Caleb fairly started with surprise.
A tin box? he echoed  and then recovering
his composure, as his lean form was elevated
with an air of dignity; I am at a loss to
understand
your allusions, Mr. Pydgeon.
Bah! Wasn't I present at the office of
Is'rel Bonus when he drew up your Deed for
this very house? An' did not you put the
deed in a tin box with other valleyable papers.
An' did not you say that you kept that box in
a small room at the head of the stairs?
W-e-l-l! ejaculated Brother Caleb. You
have an astonishing memory, Mr. Pydgeon
And what then?
Stewel inserted his thumbs in the arm-holes
of his waistcoat:
Why, I'm a poleese offisser. I aint easily
fooled. Now, to cut a long story short, do
you remember a ragged devil, as came to pay
his rent while you and old Bonus was in
confab?
I do not, said Brother Caleb, opening his
his eyes to the utmost tension of their lids.
S-i-r, Stewel drew a step nearer, That
ragged devil was a burglar. An imported
furrin
burglar, commonly known as Persimmon
Jake.
A-h! ejaculated Stewel, and the light
slipped from his hand and fell upon the table.
Persimmon Jake and ten others planned
the robbery of your house this very night. I'm
a poleese offisser, Mr. Goodleigh, I am.
And you have arrested the burglars? said
Brother Caleb eagerly.
No, s-i-r! Not so green as that! Want
to ketch 'em in the act, I do. At this minnut,
sir, there's ten burglars in your basement
story
Ten burglars in my basement story!
Two of 'em in the small room up
stairs
What do you say?  Caleb grasped the
lamp, while his face betrayed violent agitation.
And there's ten of my 'special poleese in
the next room. In the next room, awaitin' the
signal to pounce upon the cracksmen.
And who is it that will give the signal?
Zounds, sir! this looks like a very stupid piece
of work on your part
There's a closet in that room, a closet
with a glass winder
Y-e-s
Suppose I was to buy over one of the
burglars, and put him in the closet, and tell
him to holler out the minnit his cronies laid
hands on the box?
Well? You have done this? Ah, I see
your idea. Excellent, Mr. Pydgeon.
And yit he called me stoopid! exclaimed
Stewel, with a proper sense of wounded merit
Mr. Goodleigh, you'll jist please to take
that light, and walk up stairs and see them
cracksmen, or two of 'em at least, in the hands
of the poleese. My poleese.
At once, Brother Caleb, light in hand, led
the way from the room.
In a second, he was passing along the wide
entry, with Stewel following at his heels.
Brother Caleb's face displayed considerable
anxiety, while Stewel's was agitated by a
succession
of singular contortions.
You'll find your tin box as safe as a bug
in a rug, and the thieves in the hands of my
poleese.
Brother Caleb ascended the wide stairway
2
without a word. At the head of the stairway
was the passage leading to the room, and at the
commencement of the passage appeared the
door of another room.
My poleese is here! whispered Stewel.
Don't you hear 'em whisperin'? Push on!
Brother Caleb led the way along the passage,
whose floor was covered with a thick carpet.
In a moment, he stood at the door of the small
chamber. It was closed. Stewel remarked
that his hand trembled, as it enconntered the
silver knob.
I hear no sound, whispered Caleball
is still. Do you think your police have
secured
the thieves?
Push open the door. In a minute all will
be `self evident,' as Tom Jefferson remarks in
one o' his epistolatory letters.
Brother Caleb opened the door, and his
light flashed over the walls of the small
chamber
.
At a glance the whole scene was
revealed
.
The closet door was open; the lid of
the desk was raised; the closet was vacant;
the tin box had disappeared from its
appropriate
pigeon-hole.
Stewel caught a glimpse of Brother Caleb's
face. It was white as a shroud. The eyes
rolled wildly in their sockets.
`Ruined! he ejaculated, ruined, by !
and would have fallen to the floor, had it not
been for the extended arm of Stewel.
Keep a stiff upper lip, man, suggested
the police officer. You forgit that my
poleese
is on hand. What'll you bet that they
aint got the thieves and the tin box in yonder
room?
Go  on! cried Brother Caleb, wildly
waving his right hand: Do not lose a minute!
Quick! quick! He pointed toward the door.
Leaving him alone, Stewel left the small
apartment, and hurried toward the room at the
head of the stairs. The short time which
elapsed during his absence seemed an age to
Brother Caleb.
Ruined! ruined! he ejaculated, his blue
eyes flashing with a manic's glance; Ah!
This is some infernal plot! Where is Jervis
all this while? Can he have anything to do
with the disappearance of the tin box? Why
does this Police Officer delay?
Stewel crossed the threshold as the last word
fell from his lips. Stewel's visage was per
fectly blank. He approached Brother Caleb
without speaking, his hands in his pockets and
and his nether lip between his teeth. There
was a singular vacancy in his glance; he looked
very much like a man who is just one minute
too late for the steamboat.
Well, w-e-l-l! gasped Caleb.
W-e-ll! echoed Stewel, in a prolonged
tone, which terminated in a low whistle.
Speak! You are not dumb! Your officers
where are they?
Sold, responded Stewel, Reg'larly sold.
That's the sum total. My poleese aint there,
Mister Goodleigh. Nor the thieves, nor the
tin box. I'm reg'larly sold, I tell you.
Scoundrel! shouted Brother Caleb,
making
a dash at Stewel's red cravat: What
have you done? This is your plan to entrap
the robbers, is it? Do you know that that tin
box is worth more than life to me? By
I could brain you as willingly as I ever crushed
a snake with the heel of my boot.
Don't swear, responded Stewel, cautiously
retreating from the enraged man, as he put
himself
into a pugilistic attitude. And don't lay
hands on me. Tech me, and you tech the
L-a-w! Could I help it, if my poleese did
not come accordin' to 'p'intment? Th' amount
o' th' thing is jest this. The thieves has been
here. They have murdered the boy whom I
placed in that closet. They have made off
with the tin box. I tell you we're
sold
all
round.
And so you did not assure yourself of the
presence of your police, at the time when you
placed your spy in the closet? exclaimed
Goodleigh with suppressed rage.
Course
not
. 'Spose I'm green? Among
my poleese was one or two o' th'
cracksmen
,
who'd 'ave been sure to cut my throat if they
suspected I was at the head o' th' business.
You see the thieves hate me like p'ison.
If I understand you right, slowly
remarked
Brother Caleb, your police came
here in company with the two robbers, as
robbers? This is a mysterious affair, Mr.
Pydgeon. It may cost you your situation.
Do you comprehend me?
This threat, made with due emphasis, did
not seem to frighten Stewel quite out of his
senses.
Can't say as I do. You wouldn't go to
make a complaint to the City authorities?
Gammon! Emphatically gam-mon! You
want your tin box, I calc'late. Question is
how shill you git it?
These words seemed to have made an
impression
on Brother Caleb. Shaking in every
gaunt limb with agitation, he passed his hand
over his brow, and for a moment, seemed
buried in thought.
Bring me that box before to-morrow
night, he said, raising his head, and I will
give all the money which it contains. The
papers  private papers relating to my family
are all that I care about.
How much money did you say was in the
box?
Fifteen thousand dollars, more or less.
Stewel started back as though he had been
shot.
Fif-te-e-n thousand! he echoed, and then
relapsing into thought, muttered to himself
Mister Charles Augustus Milliken, I do
wonder where you air about this time!
Speak, do you think you can recover the
box? asked Brother Caleb with great
eagerness
.
Who knows? There's no harm in
tryin'
Hush! Do you hear that? exclaimed
Caleb, elevating his hand with a gesture of
caution
Voices in the entry yonder
footsteps
too! H-u-s-h! The thieves are in the
house yet.
The noise proceeded from the passage
leading
from the small chamber toward the wing
of the mansion.
It was now Stewel's turn to be surprised.
This noise did not enter into his calculations.
Wonder what it can be? he muttered
It can't be young Milliken a-tryin' to get out
o' th' house? He's had a half an hour and
more already.
What are you saying? whispered
Brother
Caleb: Do you hear that?
The sound of a key turning in the lock,
broke harshly on the stillness.
Shading the light with one hand, Brother
Caleb motioned with the other to Stewel, and
Stewel accordingly crept quietly behind Brother
Caleb.
The door was opened, and a beautiful girl,
clad in a dark cloak, crossed the threshold.
Her eyes flashed with spectral radiance from
a face white as snow.
By the hand she led a blindfolded man,
who exclaimed as he crossed the threshold, and
entered the small chamber
Remember your promise! Don't harm me!
I'll be quiet and obey.
You may imagine the surprise which dilated
Brother Caleb's eyes, as he saw his friend, the
Preacher, led blindfolded across the floor, by
the hand of the very girl whom he had led
from Church.
Stewel, peeping over the shoulder of Brother
Caleb, beheld the face of the girl, and cried
with an oath  A ghost, or my name's not
Stewel Pydgeon!
Advancing with a hurried step, Caleb laid
his hand on the Preacher's arm; the girl did
not seem to behold him. Her eyes, dazzlingly
bright, were fixed on vacancy.
Don't harm me, whispered the Preacher,
trembling all over: You know your promise.
At her request you spared my life. I'm to
go with you, from the house, and to go out
west, to Ellen's grave. Don't harm me.
Why Jervis! cried Brother Caleb.
What's this? A little melo-drama of your
own getting up?
As he spoke, a form advanced from the
background, a young man clad in a bearskin
over-coat, with a fur cap drawn over his eyes.
Let us pass. This matter does not
concern
you, said the young man, confronting
Brother Caleb.
And at the same moment, the young man's
arms were pinioned from behind, and the voice
of Stewel was heard, as his round face
appeared
over the young man's shoulder:
Got him, Goodleigh! The thief!
Hurray
for the tin-box. I say!
CHAPTER THIRD.
THE BURGLAR AND THE GUESTS.
What! am I free? cried the Preacher,
tearing the bandage from his eyes, and at one
glance surveying the face of the girl  the
gloomy visage of Goodleigh  and the form of
Charles Lester, pinioned by the arms of Stewel
Pydgeon:
`Yes, that's right. Seize him! A thief!
a robber! He was about to murder me!
And in his delight the Preacher fairly
danced over the carpet. Poor Fanny, still in
the Magnetic state, stood like a statue, covered
with a drooping cloak, her face glowing in the
faint light.
Now, sir, said Caleb, will you have the
goodness to name your accomplices, and to
restore the tin box which you took from this
desk?
Where's your gang? added Stewel.
A moment, and you would have been too
late, exclaimed the Preacher: With this
girl as his accomplice, he was about to lead me
from this house to some haunt of robbery and
murder.
If it is not an imperlite quest'on, said
Stewel, who in a moment had seized Charles
and pinioned his hands behind his back:
Which of you two brought the gal up stairs,
the thief or the Preacher?
The Preacher! echoed that gentleman:
Sir, you are mistaken. I am no Preacher.
My name is Jervis.
Charles Lester, with his hands pinioned
behind
his back, saw the tall form of Caleb
Goodleigh
glide between his eyes and the form of
Fanny Jones. Charles was somewhat pale;
his eyes however shone with unchanging lustre.
Will you release me, sir? he said; why
am I pinioned like a thief?
Down stairs with him, said Goodleigh
fiercely: let us confront him with my guests.
Perhaps some of them may know this burglar.
Brother Caleb held the light, while Stewel
urged the captive from the room, along the
passage, and down the stairway. Charles
was perfectly still. He suffered them to lead
and urge him at their pleasure.
They entered the room adjoining the scene
of the midnight festival. Charles was placed
upon the sofa. Brother Caleb held the light
near his face, and whispered
Restore the tin box, and you are free!
Hesitate, and I will proclaim you a burglar in
the presence of my guests.
Ere Charles had time to reply, Stewel broke
in with the words
Where's the gal and the Preacher? Say?
They'll be needed as witnesses.
Brother Caleb answered him with an oath.
Do not breathe a word about them before my
guests, he whispered: they do not concern
us, neither Jervis or the girl. Now sir,
turning
once more to the captive, your answer,
if you please?
Release me, exclaimed Charles; I know
nothing of your tin box. Release me, and
permit
me to go my way.
The answer of Brother Caleb was soon
given. Turning away, he flung open the
folding
doors, exclaiming, in loud and angry tones:
I have been robbed! Yes, my house has
been entered by burglars. This way,
gentlemen
,
this way, and tell me what you think of
this fellow.
The folding doors were thrown open, and
across the threshold thronged the thirty guests;
that is, as many of them as were able to keep
their feet. Some carried wax candles in their
hands, as they surveyed the culprit, and the
brow of the pinioned man was soon revealed
in ruddy light.
Look at him, gentlemen, cried Brother
Caleb, who seemed beside himself with rage:
This fellow in the bearskin overcoat and fur
cap, has entered my house at the head of a
gang of burglars. He has robbed me of a tin
box, containing the title deeds of all my
property. Do you know him  examine his
features  there!
He tore the fur cap away, and the face of
Charles was disclosed. The young man, sitting
on the sofa, his arms pinioned behind his back,
and his visage, the object of the united gaze of
some twenty-five pairs of half drunken eyes,
seemed to have been seized with a leaden
stupor
.
His face pale, his lips apart, he gazed
around with large grey eyes, dilating with an
apathetic stare. Indeed, the events of the past
five minutes seemed to have completely
deprived
him of the powers of thought and
sensation
.
Not a word passed his lips while he was
subjected to this ignominious survey.
A bad face, said the little fat man; do
you see that eye!
Desperate villian! said the large fat man;
looks like a pirate.
Has thee pistols under thee overcoat?
politely
asked the small Quaker: If thee has,
are they loaded? and if loaded, does thee
intend
to fire them off?
Here the buxom Mrs. North took up the
story. Swelling through the crowd, like a
billow of satin and velvet, she regarded the
pale face of Charles through an eye-glass:
Rather an interesting face. Should not
wonder if he had been a pirate. U-g-h! It
quite makes one shudder.
Staggering through the throng, Slinkum
Scissleby, lean and drunken, rested one hand
upon the plump arm of Mrs. North, as he
surveyed the visage of the culprit with a leaden
stare:
Item for the Copper, he muttered:
Melancholy
effect of the perusal of French Novels.
Young man caught robbin' a house  volume
of Eugene Sue found in his pocket. W-h-a-t!
he ejaculated, as he bent nearer to the accused:
It's the same! I can swear to him!
Threatened
me to-night at the  Hotel, Room
No. 92. What an escape I've had!  with
a profound sigh  Yes, gentlemen, yes, Mrs.
North, the Daily Copper this very night has
been within an ace of losing its Sub. Steamer
in, did you say?
Mrs. North quietly pushed Scissleby aside,
for his inebriation had reached the Mezzotinto
state, and he did not seem to know the
difference
between her hand and a roll of copy, as
he pressed her plump fingers in his grasp.
Bung came forward. Bung, with flushed
face, curled hair, scarlet vest, blue cravat and
plaid pantaloons. At a glance he recognized
his friend of the evening party, in the person
of Charles Lester. But with a truly
Philadelphian
instinct, Bung had no idea of
acknowledging
a friend in difficulty; he never
knew a friend whose hands were tied behind
his back.
A b-a-d face. Quite Jack Sheppard-ish.
Send him to the Station House, Goodleigh,
and let's have a look at that copper ore.
Caleb's lean form, arrayed in the spotless
white vest and faultless azure coat, with yellow
buttons, towered over the heads of all his
guests, as he advanced once more and
confronted
his prisoner. The light which Bung
held disclosed Caleb's face in strong relief.
Ghastly at the best of times, it was now pale,
repulsive, cadaverous. His blue eyes, bulging
until they were on a line with the brow, and
flashing with cold light over the hollows of
his cheeks, gave a marked
individuality
to his
countenance.
Stewel, said Caleb, turning his head over
his shoulder, and seeking with his glance the
face of the Police officer; Take him to the
Station House.
Stewel waddled through the crowd
Come, my lark, you'll have to
mosey
,
he began
When the door was thrown open, and a
stranger who puffed and blowed as with violent
exercise, pushed through the crowd of guests,
and stood face to face with the culprit.
CHAPTER FOURTH.
CAPTAIN BRADBURNE, OF THE FALCON.
Lester! he cried, panting for breath, as
he lifted his broad-rimmed hat from his head,
I've found 'em, I've found 'em!
The stranger was below the middle stature
attired in a shabby frock coat buttoned to
the neck  and his pallid face was surmounted
by short brown hair streaked with silver.
Mr. Mervyn! ejaculated Charles.
I've found 'em, I've found 'em,
continued
the intruder, still panting and blowing:
You see I noticed you in the crowd at St.
Simon's. Saw your eye fixed upon our friend
(he named the Popular Preacher,) and
therefore
I concluded that I might find you at
Brother Caleb's house, notwithstanding the
lateness of the hour.   puts up
here, doesn't he, Brother Goodleigh?
I do not know you, sir, was the stern
response
Nor do I know this Preacher of
whom you speak. Who are you?
One of th' accomplices, whispered
Stewel
,
and his whisper was echoed by the thirty
guests.
The good Mr. Mervyn was abashed.
Holding
his hat in both hands, he exclaimed
I never had an introduction to you, but as
I saw you so frequently at St. Simon's, I
Found whom? cried Charles, like one
waking from a dream.
Harry and Annie! and Mr. Mervyn
turned suddenly and confronted the pinioned
man: What's this? Your hands bound?
This is indeed extraordinary '
Harry and Annie! exclaimed Charles
and the words roused him from his stupor
He started to his feet, bound as he was. His
face flushed in an instant; he was in
possession
of all his powers once more. As he spoke,
his voice firm and deep-toned, thrilled the
spectators with involuntary respect  we do
not say  fear.
Where have you discovered these
children
?
he said. Mr. Mervyn, who seemed half
crazed with joy, replied as he panted for
breath:
You remember what you told me to-night,
at your room in the  Hotel? Well, that
rested on my mind as I went home  followed
me to church  I was haunted by the idea
that I could identify the
woman
of your story,
with some woman whom I had lately met, in
a narrow court of this city.
Profligate old man, interrupted Scissleby,
from his chair: Met a woman  at his age.
Reads French Novels. Steamer in?
And going home from St. Simon's the
truth burst upon me all at once. I turned back
went to your hotel  hunted you all over
the city  and at last, by a lucky thought,
called at this house. The door was open. I
am here, and that's enough, but the idea which
has been working in my brain all night, is out
at last. The woman of your story, his voice
fell, and he whispered in the ear of Lester,
The woman
Ann Clarke
, is none other than
Ann Jones of Bonus Court
, where I live
Lester did not suffer him to proceed:
And the children? he said, his voice
tremulous with agitation.
Are
Ralph and Fanny Jones
, otherwise
called
Harry and Annie Baldwin
, was the
response of the Home Missionary.
Fanny Jones, repeated Charles Lester,
very slowly, but in an emphatic tone, as he
felt the blood bound and grow chill by turns,
from his heart to his finger ends: Fanny
Jones! his eye with a lightning glare
traversed
the faces of the company. The
Preacher and the girl  where are they? he
shouted in a voice of thunder: Caleb
Goodleigh
you must answer for this. Let but the
finger of harm be laid upon
her
, and you shall
answer with your blood.
The surprise of the guests, at these words,
was equal in every respect to the wonder of
the Home Missionary, when he surveyed the
young man in bonds. Brother Caleb alone
was calm and smiling.
Stewel, he whispered  whispered in a
tone audible to every ear: Remove these
persons, the robber and his accomplice, to the
nearest Station House. In the morning I will
appear against them.
Turning to his guests, he continned:
Come, my friends; let us withdraw into
the front room. It grows late, and my nerves
are somewhat ruffled. We had better
postpone
all further conversation about the `
Squashahogany'
until to-morrow.
The guests were turning away; Stewel laid
his hand upon the arm of the Home
Missionary
,
whispering, Ain't you ashamed o'
yourself
,
to go about robbin' in the name o' th'
Clergy? You're the
pious
burglar, are you?
As for Charles, all the blood in his body
seemed to mount at once, and in a torrent, to
his head. He did not struggle with the cords
which bound his hands, but grated his teeth,
as he stood motionless with despair.
No way of escape! None  none! And
Fanny is here, in this house, in the power of
Ellen's murderer. To-morrow will release me,
but to-morrow will be too late. Mr.
Goodleigh
Mr. Goodleigh hear me  only for a
moment, I beseech you.
But Mr. Goodleigh, already on the threshold
of the front room, only replied by inviting his
guests to follow him.
Leave the culprits in the hands of the
Police
,
he said: This way my friends.
Fanny in this house! ejaculated Mervyn,
who had been thunderstruck by the vague
words of Lester.
Charles again besought Brother Caleb to
hear him  only for a moment  but Brother
Caleb treated him with silent contempt. At
this moment, a singular idea, which had been
working slowly through the brain of the young
man for hours, suddenly resolved itself into a
distinct shape.
Pinioned as he was, Charles Lester
advanced
a single step:
If Mr. Caleb Goodleigh will not hear me,
he said in a loud voice, perchance
Captain
Bradburne
of the
Falcon
, will grant me the
favor of a private interview.
Why was it that Brother Caleb turned
suddenly
on his heel? Why was it that with a
changed voice, and altered countenance, he
besought
the guests to excuse him for a moment?
Perhaps the fellow will confess, he said
smiling: I don't want the trouble of a public
trial. If he restores me this tin box, I will let
him off. Walk this way, sir.
And Charles Lester, with his hands tied
behind
his back, walked through the throng, and
passed into the first apartment.
And Caleb Goodleigh closed the folding
doors, and thus, was entirely alone with the
burglar; engaged in a private and confidential
interview with the man who had robbed him
of his title-deeds.
And the guests stood looking into each
other's faces, as though a steam engine had
exploded
in the cellar beneath their feet.
And Stewel Pydgeon, Esq., made various
remarks to himself, to the effect, that he was
struck stupid; his time was burnt; he was
knocked into the middle of next week.
Amid all this, poor Mr. Mervyn stood
thunderstruck
,
pinching himself slyly to discover
whether he was awake, or only dreaming. He
made a trifling mistake in his confusion, and
pinched Stewel, who looked at him with his
large bulging eyes, as though he could have
eaten him alive.
Well, exclaimed Mrs. North, breaking
the dead stillness.
And the four-and-twenty guests (six were
under the table in the front room, we believe,)
also exclaimed Well! each one modulating
the emphatic monosyllable to his own taste.
Scissleby alone, swaying to and fro on his
chair, asked in a tone of piteous entreaty
What they meant by looking like stuck
pigs? Was the steamer in?
Five minutes elapsed, while Brother Caleb
and Charles Lester were closeted in close
conversation
in the front room.
Five minutes were over at last, and the
folding
doors were thrown open. With one
impulse
the guests started forward. Brother
Caleb
appeared on the threshold, very pale, but
with a smile upon his face.
And Brother Caleb, by his right hand, held
the hand of Charles Lester. Advancing into
the back room, and leading the young man by
the hand, he said in a distinct voice:
My friends I have made a very sad
mistake
.
This young gentleman is the son of an
old friend of mine, and I may add, of a very
rich friend. He is incapable of a mean action.
Mrs. North, allow me to make you acquainted
with Mr. Charles Lester  gentlemen, Mr.
Charles Lester.
The guests had not time to get fairly through
one surprise, before another took their breath,
and held them dumb.
Wait a few moments, whispered Charles
to the Home Missionary, and then turning to
Brother Caleb, he uttered two very simple but
emphatic words:
Now, sir
.
Brother Caleb without a word took a silver
candlestick from the hands of Bung, and
passed through the door-way leading into the
hall, followed by Charles Lester.
This way friend Charles, he said, as he
closed the door. The guests were alone once
more.
CHAPTER FIFTH.
THE GIRL AND THE PREACHER.
Along the entry, and up the stairs, passed
Brother Caleb, light in hand, followed by
Charles Lester.
Remember your promise, said Charles,
Produce the girl, or I will hold you
answerable
.
And as they stood at the door of the small
chamber, in which, as you doubtless
remember
,
stands the desk, Brother Caleb turned his
face over his shoulder, and replied:
I only cultivated the acquaintance of this
Preacher in order to throw a gloss of
sanctity
over my life, he said with a laugh, in which
there was also a tremor: But we will find
him and the girl in the Painted Room. Come
on.
The Painted Room was the apartment
beyond
the curtain.
Find them, and we will talk about the
Preacher afterward, replied Charles, as they
entered the small chamber.
It was empty. The lid of the desk was
still raised, and the closet door yet open.
Brother
Caleb uttered an oath as he beheld the
desk by the light of his candle.
Do not delay, whispered Charles; move
on, Captain Bradburne.
Brother Caleb led the way into the passage
which, lighted by a single window and adorned
by a statue, connected the wing of the
mansion
with the main edifice. At the extremity
of this passage appeared the curtain which
covered
the entrance to the Painted Chamber.
Move on, whispered Charles, no time
is to be lost.
In a moment they stood before the curtain;
Charles listened with his ears and soul. All
was still.
Go on, he said fiercely: I will not lose
sight of you, until you bring me into the
presence of the girl and the Preacher.
And, obedient as a school-boy at the
command
of his master, Brother Caleb parted the
curtain and led the way into the Painted
Chamber. There was a scowl upon his face,
which he endeavored to cloak with a smile, as
he held the candle above his head.
The Chamber is empty, said Charles, in
a tone of inexpressible despair. They are
gone. Whither? Answer me,
Captain
; you
must know. How many rooms, with pictures
such as these on the walls, have you in this
pious haunt?
There are four rooms on the third floor
two on the second, beside this; and then there
is the garret, answered Brother Caleb, casting
his eyes to the floor. His face was very
submissive
,
and yet there was a curl about his lip,
very much like a sneer.
Lead me through every room, and without
a moment's delay, exclaimed Charles: And
mark you, at the slightest sign of treachery, I
will take care of myself and of you, without
a word.
He drew a pistol from the breast of his coat.
Brother Caleb calmly arranged a button on
his white vest. Pshaw, Lester, there is no
need of any thing like this, I am your friend.
Why do I care for the Preacher? Only
because
there's such a vein of wickedness about
him when he's half drunk. Come, Lester, I
will aid you in every way in my power.
Brother Caleb smiled again and reached
forth his hand, but Charles did not seem to
remark the action. Certainly he did not take
the proffered hand. He placed his own hand
in the pocket of his overcoat, and did not for
an instant, release his grasp of the pistol.
Go on, Captain, I'll follow.
They retraced their steps, and returned to
the main building. Caleb leading and Charles
following  of course  they traversed all the
chambers on the second floor. Then ascended
to the third floor. The light which Caleb
held disclosed a range of apartments, furnished
with every thing that wealth could buy, or a
taste for luxury in its gaudiest extreme desire.
We will not stain our page with a full
description
of all the secrets of that voluptuous haunt.
Room after room was traversed. High ceilings,
painted walls, beds of down, floors covered
with `Wilton' carpet, flashed in the light at
every turn.
You seem to live in fine style, remarked
Charles, as they entered the last room on the
third floor. It must take a vast deal of
money  eh!
When one is rich and a bachelor, one
does not care for money, was the answer of
Brother Caleb. Now, Lester, you must be
satisfied. We have searched the whole house
every part, save the garret and the cellar.
The Preacher has left the house, and taken
the girl with him. Have I not complied with
request of yours? Can I do more?
Charles did not reply until after a long pause.
Glancing around the chamber, furnished like
all the others, in a style of extreme splendor,
modified by taste, he discovered a small door,
half hidden by a curtain which drooped from
the ceiling. This door, unlike the one which
communicated with the entry, was low and
narrow, looking like an entrance to a closet.
Where does that door lead? said Charles,
closely surveying Caleb's visage as he awaited
his reply.
To a closet sunken in the walls, said
Caleb quickly. The old gentleman who
owned this house a few months back, used that
closet as the depository of his title deeds. He
was a great man for real estate. Come  are
you satisfied? Let us go below  my guests
will become uneasy at my absence
He moved toward the door of the chamber,
but Charles gently laid a hand upon his arm:
Not so fast, he whispered. Caleb, I do
not doubt your word, but I should like to
examine
the contents of that closet. This way
if you please
Brother Caleb's face was contracted with an
expression of doubt and hesitation. He seemed
to be very much engaged in brushing away an
imaginary speck from the surface of his spot
less vest. As he held the candle above his
head, the light fell strong upon his forehead,
revealing its marked outline, and giving a
sinister
glare to his protruding eyeballs.
There is nothing there, he said  At
least nothing worthy of your attention. Come,
Lester; return with me to my guests. They
will begin to wonder and make remarks
about my long continued absence. We have
been engaged in this search for at least a half
an hour
A half an hour, or a half a century, I care
not, answered Lester fiercely, and a scowl
darkened over his face: Give me the light.
I will learn the contents of that closet before I
quit this room.
Caleb with an air of deep mortification
yielded the candlestick, and followed Charles
toward the narrow door.
The key, cried Lester, as he parted the
curtains aside, and examined the surface of the
door with a hurried glance. It consisted of a
single panel, and was painted in imitation of
the rich paper which covered the walls of the
chamber.
There is no key. Press your thumb
against the panel, in the right corner, near the
top  as Brother Caleb whispered these
words, he stood behind Lester, who of course
did not remark the expression of Brother
Caleb's
countenance.
We will examine your closet, said
Charles, smiling, as he obeyed the directions
of Goodleigh: Very likely we may discover
something worthy of notice behind this
mysterious
panel.
The door yielded, and receded from its
frame. Charles eagerly crossed the threshold,
light in hand, anxious to explore the closet.
The light for a moment streamed over Brother
Caleb's face, through the narrow door, as he
stood near the threshold, and then all was dark
as midnight. The door had closed as
suddenly
and as soundlessly as it had yielded to
the hand of Charles.
Brother Caleb was alone in the darkness of
the chamber.
CHAPTER SIXTH.
BROTHER CALEB'S TRIUMPH.
This trifling door is six inches thick, he
exclaimed with a laugh which resounded
harshly through the stillness: Four inches
of iron, woven and welded together, and two
inches wood. It opens and shuts by a spring.
My Friend
has discovered the spring which
gives admittance to the closet  how long
before
he will discover the spring which gives
him egress? A half an hour or a half a
century
ho, ho, Charles, Charles, it is bad to
play cards with Caleb Goodleigh when Caleb
Goodleigh has all the trumps in his own hand.
With this philosophical remark Caleb left
the Chamber, and familiar with the windings
of his mansion, descended toward the first
floor.
Ah, curses upon the stupidity of the Police
Officer, he muttered, as he reached the head
of the first stairway, from which branched the
passage leading to the wing of the main
building
Lester indeed is cared for. He cannot
harm any one. But the tin box, the tin box,
I must rogain it at every hazard.
Descending the stairs he hurried along the
entry, and in a moment, stood in the midst of
his guests again.
Pardon friends, pardon this apparent
neglect
.
But this Lester is a wild fellow  son
of an old friend of mine  came into my house
by mistake  a little affair of gallantry you
understand. I took some pains to soothe his
feelings, which, as you may suppose, were a
little ruffled by the charge of burglary.
The guests were gathered in a circle around
the buxom Mrs. North. They were
whispering
together in a low tone, and with every
appearance
of a confidential conversation, as
Caleb
Goodleigh entered the room.
There was an universal start as the voice of
Caleb resounded suddenly, drowning the low
tones of the good lady,
La, Mr. Goodleigh, you quite take one's
breath, with your melo-dramatic surprises,
said she with a mock-heroic gesture of terms
But where did you leave the young man.
Gone home  was a little ashamed of his
lark  did not like to face this formidable
company
again. I saw him out of the first door a
moment ago. Bless me, how late! After two
o'clock, I vow!
This was all said in an off-hand
conversational
way, and at the last words he drew forth
a massive gold watch from his vest pocket.
The guests stood gazing at Goodleigh and
3
then into each other's faces, with a look of
wonder that was quite grotesque.
Gone home, said a voice from the sofa,
and Mr. Mervyn, the Millerite Preacher, started
up like a ghost Gone home did you say?
And without a word for me? This is rather
strange
The good man looked up inquiringly into
Caleb's face, as he stood holding his
broad-rimmed
hat in both hands
Ah, you here yet? cried Brother Caleb
with a good humored chuckle  Mr.
Tomkins
I believe?
Mervyn is my name.
Mervyn  oh, yes I remember now. Said
Lester at the door, `Tell Mervyn to call round
at my hotel after dinner to-morrow.' If I do
not mistake he has something of great
importance
to communicate. Will you bear his
request
in mind?
He laid his hand on Mr. Mervyn's shoulder
in a friendly way, regarding him, at the same
time, with a face that smiled in every feature.
I will certainly bear his request in mind,
said Mr. Mervyn, whose pallid face was
undisturbed
by a single shade of doubt  Good
evening gentlemen and  ladies, he was
about to say, but observing only Mrs. North,
he concluded  and
lady
.
He left the room. Brother Caleb kindly
saw him to the door, observing as he was about
to cross the threshold  Keep an eye on
Charles. He needs a friend  he does indeed,
a friend like you  good night, my dear Mr.
Mervyn.
Mr. Mervyn did not reply, but hurried down
the marble steps without another word. This
midnight supper party had not impressed him
with the very highest notions of Brother
Caleb's
decorum or morality.
When Goodleigh once more entered the
scene of the festival, he found his guests in that
peculiar stage of commotion, which indicates
that the hour of retirement has arrived.
Various parties of half-tipsy convivialists
were hunting for hats and cloaks all along the
room, under sofas, chairs, and tables. Bung
was sternly endeavoring to bring Scissleby to
his feet, if not to his senses. Mrs. North, all
cloaked and muffled, had taken the arm of the
fat man  the tallest of the fat men  who
although very sleepy about the eyes, an
nounced his intention of seeing her safe through
the streets, even to the door of her residence.
And Mr. Goodleigh, bowing and smiling,
was so sorry to see them depart so early, and
`hoped to have the pleasure of all their
companies
once more, at one of his little
recherche
bachelor suppers, before a week went over
their heads.'
Steamer in? interrupted Scissleby, as lean
and very
limp
, in his melancholy inebriation
he staggered to his feet. What, the foreign
news? Cotton easy  corn moderate  money
tight  Queen Victoria in daily expectation of
another .
By the bye where's Mr. Pydgeon?
exclaimed
Brother Caleb, noticing the absence
of that distinguished personage for the first
time.
Said 'twas getten'
rayther
late, answered
Bung  and the female Pydgeon and the five
little Pydgeons would be uneasy if he staid
away much longer. He went half an hour
ago.
A sudden cloud came over Caleb's visage.
Gone? he cried in a tone of impatience.
And I wished to see him very much before he
left  in relation to the robbery too. Very
provoking. Isn't it my dear Mrs. North?
But Mrs. North was already making her
adieux
, and Brother Caleb presently followed
all his guests to the door, where he wished
them good
night, good
night! until they
were out of hearing.
Bung and Scissleby, last of all, toiled down
the marble steps, Scissleby leaning all his
weight upon his friend, and asking incessantly
for the Steamer while the Dry Goods Man
with a crushed hat and an aching shoulder,
heartly wished Scissleby, the steamer and the
Daily Copper to the  dogs.
That farce is over any how, was the
remark
of Brother Caleb, as he gazed from his
doorway, down the wide street after the
retreating
forms of his guests. How brightly
the moon shines to-night! The street is almost
as light as at noonday.
He closed the door, and was alone in that
great mansion. His steps awoke no echo as
he traversed the hall, and yet the very sound
of his shoes upon the carpet impressed him
with a sensation of loneliness akin to awe.
He entered the room of the midnight supper.
The candles were burning low; the plate on
the sideboard glimmered with a faint dull
lustre
;
the mirrors reflected the ungainly form of
Brother Caleb, as he stood in the centre of the
scene, his bright blue coat and white vest, only
throwing his repulsive features into bolder
relief
.
I am alone, he said, while his thick lips
imparted in a smile: There is no spy in the
shape of a servant to listen at the keyholes of
my house. No  no! On ship board and
on shore it's a grand thing to be
alone!
These
folks to-night, doubtless wondered at this
splendid supper spread before them, without
the presence of a single menial. Their
surprise
amused me. And yet it was very easy.
While they were talking in the back room, the
people of a neighboring Hotel, took care of
the table, and arranged the champagne. Yes,
y-e-s! 'Tis a good thing to
eat
yourself into
the good opinion of society.
Talking aloud  a habit acquired by persons
who are much alone he strode up and down
the splendid rooms, while the candles were
burning fast toward their sockets.
I have a large mansion, furnished in `
exquisite
style,' (as the auctioneers have it)
with gold plate  a cellar stored with the best
wines  chambers adorned with rare pictures
blooded horses at a livery stable not far off
have all these, and plenty of funds, and am
not so very old a man!
He surveyed his face in a mirror by the light
of an expiring candle.
Better than all, there is no one to spy out
my thoughts, or to listen to my half muttered
words. If I want company, why I can buy
the best with a good dinner. Do I want friends,
they can be had for money. In fact, I consider
myself as an individual remarkably comfortable
and as well-to-do as any man in America.
He paused in his meditative walk.
Only two men can cross my path. The
Preacher, but he is bound to me by the purest
friendship. I feed him, and feed his appetites.
This Lester  ah! wonder what he's thinking
about just now?
Brother Caleb smiled. It was a peculiar
smile, something between a grimace and a
scowl. His wide mouth made a gash in his
sunken cheeks  his eyes retreated within the
protruding lids.
The tin box! The tin box! By Jove, it
is curious! How slight a thing may change a
man's fate! That box must be in my
possession
before to-morrow night, if it costs me the
price of  this house.
Turning suddenly in his walk, he continued:
Where's the Preacher? What has become
of the Girl?
These questions seemed to involve a great
deal of reflection. For Brother Caleb, pacing
the length of both rooms, hands behind his
back, and head sunken on his breast, was
silent for a long time.
A newspaper spread open on a chair, at last
attracted him from his reverie. He took it up,
and at a glance, saw that it was the
Daily
Copper
of the previous day.
The first paragraph that caught his eye was
headed
ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.
Brother Caleb sank languidly in a chair,
and perused the paragraph with great
satisfaction
,
remarking to himself:
It is singular how many of these `
mysterious
disappearances
' occur in this quiet City.
A man with well filled pockets comes to
Philadelphia, and is heard of no more. An
item in the daily papers, is at once his obituary
and his epitaph. How does he disappear?
Where?
Really this subject admits of infinite
reflection
furnishes matter for hours of quiet
musing
.
But it's late and I must get to bed.
Accordingly Brother Caleb laid down the
paper and went leisurely up stairs to his bed
chamber, in the second story of the splendid,
but still desolate mansion.
In the meantime, while he is sleeping
soundly, let us ask, what has became of the
Preacher and the Orphan Girl?
Where is Charles Lester, who disappeared
through the closet door in the third story?
And Ralph  what has been the fate of this
barefoot and half naked ruffian boy?
CHAPTER SEVENTH.
RALPH ONCE MORE.
Once more we return to Ralph.
We left him hanging in the air, one hand
grasping the lattice, the other clutching the Tin
Box against his side. It was a perilous
moment
.
Ten feet at least were between the
young ruffian and the pavement, the lattice
was breaking in his grasp, a ruddy light
streamed from the basement story and illumined
the shadows of the yard.
Ralph raised his grey eyes to the moonlight,
muttering between his teeth, that all was lost,
and then cast a glance beneath him. It was
not a pleasant prospect. The light gleaming
in a flood from the opened door of the
basement
story, showed the surface of the yard,
one mass of ice and frozen snow, with here
and there the dark face of a brick, by way of
contrast.
In a moment a world of hopes and fears
flashed through his brain. Fanny, his dying
mother, the Penitentiary, a scuffle with the
robbers in the gloomy yard, terminating in a
murder  thoughts which we express in these
broken words, hurried through his brain like
a flood through the unclosed lock of a canal.
Here's the last o' Jonesey, he cried, and
shut his eyes. He fell. Was he dashed against
the pavement covered with ice and snow? Did
he lay there, a stunned and death-like mass of
wretchedness, clad in rags, insensible to the cold
or to the clutch of angry hands?
He shut his eyes and fell. For a moment
all was dark, a sound like Fairmount Dam
roared in his ears, and then
He unclosed his eyes, and found himself
hanging in the air within a foot of the
pavement
.
In his fall he had madly clutched the
trunk of the vine. And now, as it swayed and
and creaked with his weight, he held it firmly
with the grasp of a drowning man, looking
about him with bewildered eyes.
The light from the basement door described
a belt of brightness on the snow and ice
beneath
his feet. Voices, too, grumbling in
half-suppressed
tones, met his ear, but no face nor
form appeared in the frame of the basement
door.
Aint all over yit, muttered Ralph,
recovering
his presence of mind: Brass is trumps
always, an' legs does when brass falls short.
Fust for brass and then for legs.
He dropped upon the ice and snow. His
blood boiling with excitement, he did not seem
to feel the cold, and stood as firmly with his
bare feet on the ice-covered bricks, as though
he trod upon a floor covered with a double
thickness of Wilton carpet.
This way,a hoarse low voice came
through the basement door.
Ralph did not pause to think, but made the
best of his way toward the back of the yard.
He saw the fence which separated it from the
alley, glowing whitely in the moon. And then,
turning the corner of the wing of the mansion,
he saw the door which had given him entrance,
and the marble steps coated with ice and snow.
This way, this way the voice grew
louder.
Save your necks  the jig's up, cried
another voice.
They don't track me by the nails in my
shoes, nor by my coat nayther, said a third
voice, and then there was the sound of a dozen
pair of feet, trampling over ice and snow.
Ralph, still girding the tin box to his side,
glanced cautiously around the corner of the
house, and with that glance commanded a full
view of the narrow strip of yard which lay
between him and the basement door.
A crowd of men, dressed variously, but with
their hats brought down upon their eyes, were
hurrying from the basement door, up the steps
which ascended to the level of the yard. The
foremost of the band dashed a lantern against
the wall. Ralph knew him by his tattered
round-a-bout, and muttered between his teeth,
Blue-jay! The second person stood for a
moment in full moonlight, and, to the great
surprise of Ralph, pulled off his overcoat
spotted with great white buttons.
Stewel kin take his coat agin, Ralph
heard the muttered exclamation. And then,
still peeping round the corner, he saw the
personage
deliberately strip his boots from his feet.
You shan't swear to me by them boots,
nayther, Stewel, exclaimed Humming Bird
for it was he  No doubt you meant it
well, when you lent 'em to me, but it won't
do, old boy.
But Ralph had not much time to spend in a
longer survey of this scene. Scarcely had
Humming Bird dashed the great coat and huge
boots aside, (both worn over another coat and
pair of boots) than Blue-jay pushed him
forward
over the snow, exclaiming  Go it
Bird! Now' your time to spread your
wings.
They were rushing rapidly toward Ralph.
Seized with a panic, believing that they had
fallen into a trap prepared by Stewel, they
were making the best of their way toward the
gate. As Ralph stood at the corner of the
house, half-way between the basement door
and the gate, it must be plain to the most
obtuse
comprehension, that Ralph and his tin box
will encounter the gaze of the fugitives, before
another instant passes over his head.
And Blue-jay and Humming Bird were
followed by a crowd of other forms, dark,
ragged, disguised in all sorts of caps, and hats,
and cloaks, and overcoats.
Brass or legs? Which is it? said Ralph
to himself, clenching his right hand: If I make
a push for the gate they'll see me: if I stay
here they'll be sure to maul me, and as for the
tin box  O hokey! Won't they make a rush
for it?
One glance toward the approaching thieves,
one toward the gate which was at least ten
yards off, and then Ralph clenching his hand,
turned abruptly resolving to bury himself
against the marble steps of the back door.
At this moment his foot touched a dead
body, which was extended stiffly on the snow,
the blood oozing slowly from its severed throat.
It was the dead body of a Newfoundland
dog  a noble animal, whose black fur lay
sleek and glossy, in the shadows, against the
cold white snow.
And right before the eyes of Ralph, rose a
small structure, placed near the foot of the
marble steps, and bearing over its gaping
entrance
the significant words  BEWARE THE
DOG.
To fling himself through the narrow
entrance
,
into the residence of the dead dog,
was the work of an instant. And crouching
there, his knees touching his chin, and the tin
box resting by his side, Ralph surveyed the
yard, as a man in a light house might take
observations
along a line of rough and craggy
coast.
This is the end of all o' Stewel's plans,
said a voice, well known to the ears of Ralph,
and Blue-jay paused for a moment to
contemplate
the carcase of the dead animal.
He p'isens dogs, plants a nice leetle house
breakin' and arter all gits a dozen o' us into a
cussed trap. Oh Stewel Pydgeon!
And the voice of Humming Bird by his side
echoed with a curse, Oh Stewel Pydgeon!
Nor did the name of this respectable dignitary
die on the air, with the last accent of
Humming
Bird. For ten other figures came round
the corner of the house  stood between
Ralph's eyes and the moonlight  and gazed
from beneath their downdrawn hats and caps,
upon the dead body of the Newfoundland
dog.
Stewel Pydgeon! they groaned in
chorus
.
And Ralph shrinking within his rude retreat,
beheld these distinguished faces and stout
forms, clad in the very livery of vulgar theft,
while the broken sentences of a low muttered
conversation came distinctly to his ear.
Shill we go back? whispered Blue-jay.
Stewel may mean the fair thing, arter all,
was the remark of Humming Bird.
Else why did he p'isen that ar' dog?
muttered a third.
There was a pause  the gang of burglars
seemed to battle with the panic which had
impelled
their flight  while Ralph, afraid to
breathe, set his teeth together, and began to
feel cold for the first time.
A sound was heard, breaking horribly upon
the stillness. Was it only the crash of an
icicle falling from the roof, or the creak of an
unclosing door?
They're comin', shouted Blue-jay, Stewel
and his poleese! Run for it, every chap as
wishes to save his bacon!
And away over the frozen snow they
scampered
,
until their footsteps resounded from the
back part of the yard. Ralph heard the gate
creak on its hinges, and the noise of their
footsteps
echoed from the alley. Echoed, grew
faint and fainter, and then died away. Once
more all was the unbroken stillness of a clear,
cold winter night, with a bright moon shining
in a sky without a cloud.
But Ralph still lay quiet and snug in his
place of concealment.
When a-body's well off, a-body had better
keep dark, he muttered, and extending a
hand felt the tin box, which lay in the straw
by his side.
For a long time Ralph lay there, listening
with all his ears for the slightest echo of a
sound.
One, two! the bell of the old State House
Clock rolled over the silent city.
Like a tortoise peeping from its shell, Ralph
stealthily projected his head from the entrance
of the dog-house. The moon was shining
down among the dark walls, revealing every
nook and crevice of the yard.
Not a sound disturbed the dead stillness.
CHAPTER EIGHTH.
RALPH AND THE BOX.
Now for brass and then for legs, he
exclaimed
,
and taking up the tin box crept from
the dog-house. Stealthily around the corner,
Ralph; with bare feet crushing the frozen
snow, toward the door of the basement, Ralph.
It is the work of a moment, but the heart of
the young outcast beats wildly. One glance
toward the window from which you lately
made your perilous descent; all is still above,
and all is still around you.
Your sister is there, above you, Ralph, but
you do not know it. No, ragged savage, or
else you would hurl the tin box to the ground,
and mount to the window by the vine, and
fight for the deliverance of your sister from
Brother Caleb's house, against all the Stewels
and all the Masked Preachers in the world.
But stealthily over the frozen snow, Ralph,
until you stand at the head of the basement
steps. Sit you down there, Ralph, and quietly
endue your chilled feet, with the comfortable
boots, so carelessly thrown aside by the
Humming
Bird. It is done. Now the coat; a
warm coat, Ralph, though somewhat large; a
comfortable garment, though all too
conspicuous
,
with its buttons of white bone, every one
the size of a dollar.
Brass has done her duty, now legs must
do theirs!
Boots on his feet, great coat on his back,
and tin box under his arm, Ralph made the
best of his way toward the gate, without once
turning round his rude face, with shaggy hair,
and large grey eyes.
Arrived at the gate, which wide open seems
to favor his retreat, Ralph stands still and
hesitates
Two ends to the alley, he murmurs
Wonder at which end the poleese is waitin'?
Likely at both. Howsomever Jonesey my
boy, there's no time to go back now. Now
then for a long pull and a strong pull an' a
pull all together, as they say on 'lection
day!
He passed through the gate into the alley,
and along the alley in a western direction,
toward
the next wide street, running from north
to south. As he approached this street he took
a firmer hold of the tin box, and endeavoured
to suppress the sound of his heavy boots,
which at every step sank in the ice and snow
with a distinct crash.
The street was reachedRalph stood at
the corner of the alley, and looked eagerly
around him. The moon was shining brightly
over the roofs of the lofty houses, and over the
wide pavements, which were alike white and
glittering with snow. But no one, not even
the phantom of a police officer, was in sight.
The street as far as Ralph could see and hear,
was silent and deserted
Whither should he direct his footsteps?
Home to Bonus Court? Ralph shook his
head.
The tin box and my idea-r won't allow
that
. It's my opinion that legs had better carry
me out o' this 'ere town as quick as greased
lightnin'.
He hurried northward without another word.
Clad in the great coat which flapped and
draggled
about the heels of his cumbrous boots,
being only three sizes too large for him, Ralph
followed the street, until it crossed the Ridge
Road. The Ridge Road, as every body ought
to know, is an eccentric street. Instead of
running north or south like any well-behaved
Quaker City street, it worms and twists as
though seeking for something which it had lost.
Starting from Ninth and Vine, it winds and
zig-zags away, until it becomes a pike,
somewhere
on the outskirts of the city. It is
perfectly
New York in all its features. Cutting
sharp angles, shaving the corners of houses
it would be entirely alone in crookedness, were
it not for Old York Road, Dock Street, and
one or two others of these eccentric streets,
which run pretty much as they please, not
having the fear of `due north and south' or
`due east and west' before their eyes
Ralph entered the Ridge Road, about two
squares above the house of the Fairmount
Engine
.
He had no time to think of De Fairy
now, but pushed rapidly onward, following the
windings of the Ridge Road.
Once out o' this village, and I'll begin to
talk, muttered Ralph, when lo! a figure turned
a corner, and came toward him with its hands
in its pockets. Was it a watchman?
Ralph felt his heart beat quicker, with thump
upon thump as the figure came from the shadow
into the moonlight.
It's one of the boys! Y-a-a-s! He wears
his hat over his eyes, an' has his hair cut short
behind, and wears soap-locks over his ears.
Y-a-a-s it's one of 'em. Hello, Bokey, is that
you?
Why Jonesey! cried the new-comer
halting
suddenly and surveying Ralph with one
eye closed, in order to give the other a keener
vision, Whar did you gid dat ar wommus,
continued Bokey, speaking in a dialect peculiar
to the more enlightened districts of
Philadelphia
.
You look like Matty Van Buren in
Gineral Jackson's trowse's; if you don't
et cetera
.
Never you mind Bokey; I knows what I
knows, answered Ralph. I say Bokey did
you go to see Woodside about paintin' the
frontis-piece of the Injine?
Didn't we? I guess we did hoss. Them
other boys of the Committ
ee
stood like
stuck-pigs
couldn't say a word for their lives.
But I spoke up to him. Didn't I? Well if I
did'nt, may I be
et cetera
.
What did you say, Bokey? asked Ralph,
anxious to divert attention from the tin box,
which he hid behind his back.
Says I, says I, Woodside, and says he,
says he,
w-ha-a-t?
Says I we want a
frontis-piece
for de Fairy. What'll you have? says
he. Then I told him, `Paint us de Genius o'
Liberty chained to a rock in de middle of the
Atlantic Ocean'  says I. An' he's a-goin' to
it. Hello! What you got dar under yer arm?
He saw the tin box.
G-e-t o-u-t! Don't you see I'm 'ployed
by the 'Nited States to carry the mail twixt
Fildelfy and Manayunk?
With these words, he passed Bokey and
hurried on, at a pace between a walk and a
run. He soon came in sight of Broad street,
where a gloomy edifice, one story in height,
rose like an evil thing, in the moonlit air. A
gloomy edifice, covering a large space of ground,
and looking something like a State Prison in
its 'teens.
The House o' Refuge, cried Ralph as he
passed on. Don't git this child in that ar'
place I guess  and as though the building
awoke unpleasant reflections, he turned his
gaze another way, and increased his speed.
Where shall I go? Can't go out into the
woods this cold night. An' I can't loaf about
forever with this 'ere tin box under my arm?
What shall I do? I should like to take a peep
into it, but I can't jist now.
The box was very heavy and weighed like
lead upon his arm.
He did not hesitate, however, but pursued
his journey until he stood in front of a high
board fence, which extended along the Ridge
Road, on the extreme outskirts of the city.
A board was loose. Ralph kicked it
violently
;
it gave way, and he passed through the
crevice.
Before him rose an edifice of pale blueish
marble, which was surrounded by piles of stone
and building timber. The roof of the edifice
was white with snow.
Ralph stole around, turned this building and
soon came in sight of another edifice, compared
to which the first was but a hut standing
beside
a palace.
CHAPTER NINTH.
RALPH AND THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX.
Do you see that vast structure, rising in the
moonlight and looking like a vast edifice of
snow? Do you behold the massive pillars
which support its marble roof? Is it not
beautiful  nay  is it not sublime? Around
it are scattered piles of timber and stone; the
framework over its windows  half shadowed
by the columns  shows that it is yet
unfinished
,
and still it towers into the cold blue sky,
filling the soul at once with grandeur and awe.
And do you see the outcast boy, who
stealthily climbs the broad staircase, leading
from the ground to the foot of its columns?
Beside that great pillar he is dwindled into a
very speck. You cannot appreciate the
vastness
of these columns, until you see them
contrasted
with a human being.
And the moon plays upon the marble roof,
and upon the marble flowers which wreathe
the summit of each column. And a silence
deeper than the grave reigns throughout the
marble mountain, with its rooms like vaults and
its passages like caverns.
Ralph enters the great door of the marble
edifice  the door which faces to the south.
A chill like death fastens on his veins. For
the place is colder than a subterranean vault.
He crosses the passage, from whose marble
floor a stairway ascends, and pauses in a
moment
in the centre of a vaulted chamber.
The ceiling arches above his head. The
floor is marble beneath his feet. A silence,
whose very intensity appals him, encloses him
as a coffin encloses the dead. And through a
window, which is only half covered by
unplaned
boards, trembles a broad ray from the
midnight moon.
And in the ray, upon the floor of Girard
College, kneels the Outcast Orphan who has
been made a thief by a Police Officer of the
great city, to which Girard bequeathed his
millions.
Hark! A footstep sounds without. Ralph
trembles, starts to his feet, looks around, and
kneels again.
It's only my fancy, he soliloquizes, the
watchman's sound asleep in his box, and
Girard
College is the last place where the 'spect
to find a fellow with a tin box at this time o'
night.
The box is fastened by a small padlock,
dangling from the side. Ralph has no key, and
in fact is without the means to break the lock.
A lucky thought seizes him.
This is Stewel's coat, and it 'ud be queer
if there wasn't nothin' like a knife in its
pockets.
Plunging his hand into the capacious pockets
of the coat, Ralph presently drew forth a bunch
of keys, a jack-knife and a file. With the file
he forces the lock: the lid of the box opens at
his touch. Then quietly he empties the
contents
of the box upon the marble floor.
Do you see him in the moonlight, with his
grey eyes growing larger every moment, and
his ruffian face stamped in every line with
dumb amazement?
Before him lie outspread the contents of the
box. Papers, bank notes, and gold in
handsful
.
Never a more delicious banquet was
spread upon a Banker's table.
Ralph was fairly frightened by this display
of Bank notes and gold.
Wonder if they haint pennies arter all?
he soliloquized, as he caught at a handful of
the glittering pile, and suffered it to glide
between
his fingers. Gold, rale gold  why,
there must be a
thousand
dollars here!
A thousand dollars was the utmost limit of
Ralph's idea of immense wealth. With a
thousand dollars he imagined a man might buy
the State House and the United States Bank
together.
What shill I do with it? Where shill I
put it? Cuss it, but I'm in a purty scrape!
Ralph rose and paced the floor; every step
was answered by an echo, which growled
through the vast building like distant thunder.
Ralph, scratching his tangled locks and
cracking his fingers, wandered up and down
alone  while the golden pile shone brightly
on the floor.
I have it, I have it, he cried at last, there
is many a dark corner under the marble roof,
in the cock-loft of this college. I'll fix the
business in five minutes, or my name's not
Jonesey.
He gathered up the gold. Not a single piece
was forgotten. He gathered up the parchment
and bank notes. He placed gold and
parchments
and bank notes within the tin box again.
Then crossing the vaulted hall, he entered
another hall as vacant and gloomy, with a tiny
thread of moonlight playing through its
darkness
.
This hall was soon traversed. Ralph
stood in the passage, or corridor, on the
northern
end of the building, at the foot of the
stairway which, suspended  as it seemed
in air, led to the upper chamber, and to the roof
of the College. This slight staircase, built of
marble, was covered with rough boards. Ralph
clutched the tin box, and hurried upward. It
was very dark. A single misplaced step, and
he would have been dashed to pieces. At last
he reached the topmost step, and stood upon
the marble floor in the story of the College
immediately
beneath the roof.
Dark as the very mischief; but somewhere
here there's a wooden stairs, which hangs on
the end o' th' college like a martin box.'
He found the temporary stairway after much
difficulty, and ascended the creaking steps. He
was in utter darkness. His mind became
confused
;
he was afraid, and would have retraced
his steps, had he known which way to tread.
He reached forth his hand, and it encountered
one of those massive piles of brick which
support
(or seem to support) the immense roof
of the College.
And there, in one of those nooks which at
noonday are dark as midnight, he placed the
Tin Box, covering it with a mass of loose sand,
dry mortar, and other rubbish which overspread
the solid floor.
That's done. Now I'll make tracks for
home, and have a talk with Fanny. Somehow
or 'nother, Fanny has
idees
which I can never
get hold of.
But how should he retrace his steps in the
thick darkness?
While searching for the wooden stairway by
which he ascended, he was attracted by a dim
light, shining only a few paces beyond him.
The stairs that lead to the roof of the
College
,
exclaimed Ralph; b'lieve I'll go up
and take a look at the moonlight.
Up the narrow stairs, between the huge walls,
or masses of brick and mortar, which touched
him on either side, he ascended. It was not
long before he stood upon that pavement of
marble blocks, which forms the roof of the
College. That roof, covered with snow, was
darkened suddenly by a long belt of blackness
the shadow of Ralph the Outcast, standing
under the canopy of Heaven, on the summit
of the marble pile.
The sight which met his eyes for some
moments
held him dumb. The Great City, a
wilderness of roofs, white with snow,
extending
far away in the clear cold light of the
wintry
moon!
On the east, the broad Delaware shone with
a tremulous lustre on every wave; on the west
the mound of Fairmount, clothed in a mantle
of snow, rose boldly into the cloudless air.
Steeples, roofs, towers, on the one hand, and on
the other, the country side, whose woods and
fields and farm houses looked pure and
beautiful
in their garment of spotless white. The
hills of Jersey, a bleak uneven line, broke
abruptly
into the eastern sky, while to the west
extended a vague prospect of villages amid
woods, of mansions on the verge of tranquil
waves, and in the far distance rose a glimpse
of the hills of Brandywine.
Philadelphia
was beneath the feet of the
Outcast Boy. Embraced by her rivers  the
Delaware, flashing broad and deep; the
Schuylkill
,
gleaming like a silver thread  she slept
beneath her countless roofs, a vast wilderness
of wealth and misery, with the eyes of one of
her ten thousand Heathen surveying her every
feature by the rays of a cloudless moon.
Oh, you may talk of the savage grandeur of
the desert, untrodden by the foot of man, of
the awful solitude which invests the traveller,
who looks upon the world from the topmost
peak of Chimborazo; but here, beneath your
feet, is a desert, a solitude, whose desolation
and whose loneliness are made up  not of
rocks and stones  but of the misery of human
hearts, scourged and lacerated by the fangs of
a barbarous Civilization.
Look at Philadelphia, as she sleeps beneath
the moon, snow upon every roof  is she not
pure and beautiful in her white robes?
The outside of the Sepulchre!
Without a garment of stainless purity
within `rottenness and dead men's bones!'
Pierce their countless roofs; dive into the
caverns, which spread beneath that mantle
which looks white as an angel's wing;
descend
into the Sepulchre  What then?
Look at Ralph the Outcast, as he stands
upon the roof of Girard College. Yonder in
the Penitentiary, which rises to your right
a Bastile that intervenes between your sight
and the white ground of Fairmount  there are
hundreds of convicts, who one day were
Ralphs, and who now, having ripened from
friendless childhood into felon manhood, are
counting the slow moments of the night, by
the irregular beatings of their hearts.
Shall this young Ralph, ever ripen into the
Dead Sea fruit of the Penitentiary?
The young ruffian in his uncouth dress,
raised his large eyes to the sky, and saw the
moon shining there above, with a single star
not far away, and then a chaos of half formed
thoughts began to break in waves, upon the
beach of his barren soul.
Was there a God? Did HE love the Rich
better than the Poor? Does HE care for me,
poor outcast that I am  outcast baptized in
want and hardship, and about to be admitted
into full Communion with the terrible church
of crime?
4
Thoughts like theseof course not
expressed
in these wordscame half muttered
from the lips of Ralph as he stood alone on
the roof of Girard College.
I'll go home to Bonus Court, and take
advice
of Fanny, said Ralph.
Clad in his white coat, he descended from the
College, left the grounds, and after passing along
Franklin Avenue, for a half a mile, entered
a southern street, which led toward Bonus
Court.
At the entrance of Bonus Court he stood at
last. The darkness of that den, was only
broken by a faint ray. A light glimmered
from the window of the lower room. Ralph
hesitated.
Wonder if mother's dead? he said as he
entered the CourtRayther think Fanny 'll
be surprised when she hears I'm so rich.
Did'nt I
do
that Stewel PydgeonG-e-t
o-u-t! Charles Augustus Millikin you're a
precious cuss, you are.
Ralph laughed to himself as he looked
through the window, into the room occupied
by John Cattermill the Drunkard.
While Ralph hesitates before the window,
let us return for a few moments to the summit
of Girard College. Let us place the young
outcast once more upon the marble roof, and
listen to a Sermon preached by a writer of
immoral books. You, that wish to pursue
only the plot of this narrative, may skip the
ensuing chapter. But you that wish to hear
a Sermon, with Girard College for a pulpit,
will do well to read the words which follow.
CHAPTER TENTH.
A SERMON FROM THE TOP OF GIRARD COLLEGE,
By A Writer of Immoral Books.
Doth not a curse rest upon the Great City?
Is it not better to abide in the shadow of the
mountain top, where the air of God is free,
where the child learns Religion at the mother's
breast, where the calm scenes of unpolluted
naturethe valley dotted with houses, the
mountain rising above into the sky, the
Susquehanna
singing on among its mountain
shoreslift the heart to Heaven at once,
without the medium of the Preacher's prayer
or the church's psalm?
It is good to dwell in the free country.
It is good to abide on the mountain side,
where the sunlight bathes your face, just
after it has left the gate of Heaven. It
is good to abide in the vast deep woods,
where every flower is a character of Lord's
handwriting, and where the summer air and
the winter blast are ever singing one great
anthem of praise.
But there is a Curse upon the great city.
A curse that takes many forms and speaks in
many voices, but is, everto-day, yesterday
and to-morrowthe same. At noonday, in
front of the Old State House, it stalks abroad,
in the form of the Unjust Judge, who has
learned his Religion from the bitter waters of
Hatred, and who only speaks in accents of
damnation. The Curse is in the streets in
these shapes of misery and want, these Lepers
of Civilization. It is in the Courts, where the
dock swarms with criminals, while the bench
is solemn with that Justice, whose sword is
sharp only for the poor man's throat.
There is a Curse upon the great city. With
the lowly poor in their dens of want, in the
narrow alleys where squallid crime drowns
the fever of despair in draughts of liquid fire,
and in the great mansion, where the revel,
bought with the poor man's labor, roars on
from midnight until break of day.
It walks into the office of the Editor, the
Curse of the great city. It pours vitriol into
his heart, and points with vitroil his pen. To
stab private character for pay  to pollute the
mind of youth with advertisements that give
immunity to lust, and for a price, offer to
poison the fruit of the Mother's womb  to
meet the cry of the poor man's agony with a
sneer  to crush with a pious lie, every hope
of reform, every throb of progress  to sell
the rights of Humanity for a Dollar, as Iscariot
for thirty pieces of silver, sold his God
behold the life of an editor who is swayed by
the Curse of the Great City.
Sometimes it is found in the office of the
Lawyer. It turns him into a sower of crime,
and he plants dishonor so that he may reap
gold. With a brain palsied to all sense of
right or wrong, with a conscience seared
alike to the wail of Humanity or the still
small voice of God, with a hand always
grasping
,
always itching for the wages of pollution,
beheld the Lawyer, infected by the Curse of
the Great City. Gold! That word
overspreads
the horizon of his life. Gold
however
gotten, gold however won  wrung
from the widow's palm, or torn from the
orphan's
heritage, or coined in the damnation of
the virgin's heart  always gold.
Whence comes the universal Curse?
Whence this universal fever for the fruits of
labor, without labour's honest work? Why
this eternal combat, between man and man,
between weak and strong, and all for the
wages of the poor man's toil?
It is because there is no such thing as
Justice
for
YOU,
while
YOUR NEIGHBOR
has
one more dollar than yourself?
Does the Curse result from the
unnatural
association of all classes of the human tribe
in a large city? Sad and pitiful
spectacle
!
Is there only one loaf of bread in the
world, that you and your neighbor, must take
knife in hand, and fight for the right to live?
Does this eternal warfare, engender a spirit
of avarice in its last extreme of lust, a morality
of selfishness, that can descend into no lower
depth of baseness, a Religion that has no more
heart than the stone on which you tread, a
Justice that, like the Hindoo Car, only moves
to crush the weak and rend the poor?
Jefferson, whose memory we will forever
wear in our hearts, thanking God who gave
us our apostle of Humanity, to say iron truth
in the face of brazen wrong, once uttered a
volume in this line
A great city is the sore of the body
politic
.
What an ulcer for the knife of the Great
Physician of souls. What a canker for Satan
to cure with his vast fund of quackery! With
Preachers that talk theology while man lies
bleeding in the last ditch of sufferance; with
lawyers that prate of Blackstone, while the
Law of Christ is trampled under their feet;
with Judges who whine forth words of
smoothest
sound, while they pour the miserable and
the wronged, into the Alembic of the
Penitentiary
.
Sweep the roofs from this large City at
midnight. Look down upon the scenes: here
a murder  there a seduction  yonder a
forgery  then a midnight outrage that cannot
be named but in a whisper  all crowded
together
,
enacting at the same moment, going
on under this moonlit Heaven, while law and
judge and priest, are slumbering sound.
Gaze from the summit of Girard College,
upon the great city  the house-tops are
uncovered
.
The Anatomy of civilization lies
open to your gaze. Summon the fiends of
darkness to your side. How they chuckle as
these scenes unclose before their gaze! Then
with a voiceless prayer, beseech the Angels,
who watch yonder by the Throne, to turn their
gaze for a moment only, upon this dumb
tragedy
,
which only manifests its agony, in broken
throbs. Look! The tears are falling from the
Angels' eyes. Tears of blood?
Yonder at the lonely hearth the widow
starves, with her babe lying dead upon her
breast. Yonder the bank directors hold their
orgie, and plan a new and legal robbery of the
common people. Yonder the White Slave
toils at her needle, sewing the garments of
luxury with tears, and bartering her lungs for
a crust of bread.
Yonder glides the Priest, under the quiet
mantle of the night  he has just finished
some potent sermon  something against the
Pope, or maybe something flavorous with
sulphur, upon Eugene Sue and French
Novels. Ho! Sir Priest whither tends your
steps at dead of night? Shall you take wine
with the Deacon, or join the orgie of these
smooth robbers, who speculate upon the gain's
of the poor man's blood? Shall you, with the
odor of pulpit and sermon fresh upon your
garments, steal to these Homes of Baker
Street, and tell the Lepers there, that the Lord
Christ died for them? No  home to your
study. The wine is good, and the pen is
sharp. Before you spreads the Rent-Roll of
Trinity Church. Come  we are waiting.
Write straightway a good sermon, in favor of
Trinity Church and her Forty Millions of
Dollars. But while you are writing, look
yonder for a moment, to that lake of Galilee
look firmly, though your gaze traverses the
mists of eighteen hundred years  and tell us
what do you behold?
The Christ who has just been preaching
to multitudes of the Poor, is now sitting in
their midst, feeding these poor with actual
bread!
Is this your answer Priest? Do you
pretend
to believe in this Christ; you who preach
to the Poor, and at the same time rob them of
land, of bread, of the means of life, and of life
itself?
But look again from this summit of Girard
College.
Yonder in the lonely sick room dies the
father, gazing around with a glassy eye, while
the children and the lawyers are fighting about
his will.
Yonder in his snug room the Judge is
sleeping
and there, on your right, the Penitentiary
blackens on your sight. That great Coffin of
Stone, in which the living are buried. Judge!
how many of your victims are withering there?
The night is very clear, Judge, and the voice
of Abel's blood goes up yonder, from many a
cell of the penitentiary. Do you hear it? No?
But when you are dying, Judge, shall you not
hear it then? Jeffreys was once as brave as
you are now. Once seated on the Bench, he
talked of good old English law, and washed
his hands in blood. So legal and demure was
Saint Jeffreys. How did Jeffreys die? Can
you tell, Judge?
Another scene!
A maiden is kneeling at the feet of a rich
man's son. He is smoothly clad in fashionable
attire; she wears the faded garb of poverty.
She has worked so hard, she has worked so
long, for a wretched pittance per day  and
there is so much wealth, so much luxury to be
won by the mere sacrifice of her honor.
Even she the poor girl has honor. The Rich
Man's son is pleading  she is pleading at his
feet, hesitating ere she crosses the line which
divides Heaven and Hell. How eloquently he
pleads!
No one cares for you. You work sixteen
hours for sixteen pennies. I have money.
You talk of Religion  what has the Religion
of the Church done for you? You talk of Law,
what has Law or Justice done for you? Poor,
you must give your life for a crust. But you
are young and very beautiful
And do you blame the White Slave, that she
listens to the voice of Sin, when it comes clad
in gold, while Virtue by the custom of the large
city, only bears injustice, starvation, and
cankered
lungs?
But we will descend from the roof of Girard
College. The sights that we see, and the
words that we hear, do not amuse us very
much. Yet ere we go, let us look back through
the shadows of eighteen hundred years, and
ask whether the Gospel which shone from the
casement of a Carpenter's Hut, shall ever
walk in its divine force, along the avenues of
the Great City, feeding while it preaches, and
transforming the wilderness of despair into a
Golden City.
A Golden City
! Golden with brotherly
love, golden with justice higher and deeper
than old English law, golden with impulses
born of God, and working for the good, not of
the greatest number, but of the whole number?
O, if this leaf which I have written should
wander down the pathway of the next century,
and encounter the eyes of 1949, how will the
readers of that era, living admist a redeemed
civilization, wonder at the barbarous laws and
fiendish theologies of the year 1849?
CHAPTER FORTY-SEVENTH. [sic]
RALPH AT HOME.
There's a glim o' light inside, but I can't
see no one, soliloquized Ralph, as he looked
through the window, Fust of all, I must get
rid of this coat and these 'ere boots.
Ralph opened the door, and entered the
room of Cattermill on the first floor. All was
still. A candle burning fast toward the socket,
shone over the comfortless place, but it was
utterly deserted.
Where's John an' his wife an' his baby?
exclaimed Ralph, gazing around the naked
floor and walls. Cuss me, I'd forgot! Did'nt
I see John with the gang, when I was in the
dog-house? Stewel got hold o' him too! A
precious Stewel! Nancy's up stairs with
mother, I 'spose. Now for business.
Ralph took off the great coat. Placing it
upon the fireless hearth, (he had in his walk
from the College emptied its pockets) he threw
off the heavy boots, and arranged them on top
of the coat.
Here goes for a little 'lection fire, he
said, as he applied the candle to the coat; I
did'nt like to throw it away, a-cause I was so
cold. Howsomever it 'ill burn. Look there!
John and Nancy are poor folks, he continued
with a grimace, and poor folks can't do
without fire. There's a blaze to bring out the
Fairy!
A heavy smoke, accompanied by a dingy
flame, began to ascend upon the hearth.
Squatting down like a beast on its haunches,
Ralph placed his face between his hands, and
listening all the while for the sound of a
footstep  began to reflect calmly upon the
strange incidents of the night.
Sartainly Stewel took me for somebody
else. Sich lots of fun as Fan and I will have
to-morrow, when we go out to th' College and
count them specie and bank notes! Now if
mother could only live, we'd have a nice time
of it together. Mother! 'Guess she's gone
dead about this time, but  looking to the
stairway door  Can't go up stairs until
Stewel's coat and boots is gone into smoke.
A precious smellin' pair o' boots them is to
be sure! B-a-u-g-h!
At this moment, as Ralph half stifled by the
smoke, was endeavoring to arrange the fire,
the door opened behind him, and a form
entered the lonely room.
A great deal o' fun can be got with a
thousand dollars, cried Ralph, when a mild
voice was heard at his shoulder
Mister Charles Augustus Milliken, how
are you!
Ralph looked up and beheld Stewel
Pydgeon
.
Stewel in all his plenitude of flesh, with his
full moon face glowing over a closely buttoned
overcoat; Stewel with a glazed cap drawn
over his forehead; Stewel with his hands in
capacious pockets, and a cigar in his extensive
mouth.
Come, my young gentleman! Fork over
that
tin box, and then we'll come to some
understandin'!
At the same moment the stairway door
opened. The mild face of Hannah, the
Millerite's
daughter, appeared beside the visage of
the Quaker woman, Martha Lott. Ralph,
however, did not see them.
He only beheld Stewel Pydgeon.
Rising slowly to his feet, his bony from clad
in its rags once more, he folded his arms, and
confronted the Police officer. His matted hair
encircled the upper part of his face, but his teeth
were set, his lower jaw fixed and rigid as iron.
That
tin box, said Stewel, drawing a
mace from one pocket, and a pistol from the
other.
At this moment, a scene of deep interest is
progressing in the third story.
The Priest with the skull-cap fitting closely
over his brow, and small eyes glimmering from
the depths of their socket  the Priest whom
Ralph called from the Church of Saint John
is sitting by the bed of the dying woman. Her
hand, stricken by pestilence, clasps his wrist as
it has clasped it for three hours. He turns
his gaze away from that face, made fearful by
fever struggling with the damps of death, and
shuddering in his dark attire, listens to the
words which fall, low, muttered, but distinct,
from her clotted lips.
The candle is burning low, the fire has gone
out in the sheet-iron stove. The place would
be chill and damp, were it not for the fetid
atmosphere of pestilence. The Priest is very
pale; his thick lips have lost their hues of red,
and the hand which the dying woman clutches
by the wrist, quivers incessantly.
For three weary hours, he has been alone,
with the departing soul. Alone, (for Hannah
and the Quaker Woman had retired to the
room on the second floor) alone, and yet he
has not been conscious of the flight of time.
Those three hours in the death-chamber have
passed with lightning wings. Many times has
he endeavored to free his wrist from the
death-clutch
of the woman's hand, but never once
has he wished to seal his ears to the accents
of her Last Confession.
Her face, with dark hair streaked with
silver, has appalled him with its unnatural
look, but her words have passed one by one,
into his soul.
For the Confession uttered by the dying
woman was wild, improbable, exceeding in
every detail the most incredible creation of
fiction, and yet it bore truth upon its every
word and tone.
I cannot believe it, exclaimed Father
John  at the moment when we take up the
scene, at least three hours since his entrance
into the death-room  You are not speaking
of human beings, but of fiends.
The dying woman repeated two names in a
clear voice, while her eyes rested vaguely upon
the pallid face of the Priest.
Reuben Gatherwood! she said, Lemuel
Gardiner!
By the agitation which pervades the frame
of the Priest, we can discover that these names
have been uttered often, and with fearful power,
in the course of her Confession.
The Confession we will now repeat, in our
way, leaving the Priest and the dying one
alone for a little while. In our own way, for
the
exact
words of the Confession are too
fearful in their character, to be recorded on our
page.
While Ralph confronts Stewel on the first
floor, while the clutch of that death-stricken
hand holds the Priest by the bed of despair,
let us look at a Leaf from the Past. Let us
look at Tragedy which is enacted every day,
but which has never been described in a work
of fact or fiction, for reasons that will occur to
every reader, after the perusal of the following
Revelation.
It is dangerous ground that we are about to
tread.
CHAPTER TWELFTH.
THE HISTORY TOLD BY THE DYING WOMAN.
This world of ours has many beautiful sights,
but the holiest spectacle which it offers to the
eye of God, is, a husband and a wife sitting by
their own fireside, while the winter's sleet and
snow beats against the window pane. Upon
the knee of the wife sleeps a rosy boy, whose
tiny hands are folded over his breast, while the
light of Home plays over his golden curls and
over his face, which smiles in slumber as though
a dream was passing before the eyes of his soul.
There they are, shut out from all the world,
the curtains drawn across the window, the old
clock ticking in one corner, and hickory logs
blazing upon the hearth, with a cheerful glow
and an odor that tells of forest trees, green and
hearty with the vigor of the summer time.
The snow lays white and cold upon the
fields without, beneath a dull and leaden sky.
A silence reigns over the leafless woods, deep
as death, and only broken by fitful gusts of the
drear north wind. All is drear and desolate
around that grey stone house, built upon the
side of a hill, with a strip of woodland
encircling
it on every side but one, and that one
side opens through the darkness of night a
glimpse of Philadelphia, with a light haze
resting
upon its wilderness of roofs.
Within the two storied stone house the old
clock throbs in its walnut case, and the hickory
fire burns beneath the chimney arch.
The husband sits on one side, with an open
volume resting on his knee. His eyes are
fixed upon the face of the wife, who is seated
opposite, her hands clasped over the sleeping
boy, nestling on her knee, while her gaze rests
dreamily upon the fire.
The husband is a man of only twenty-five
years. He has thrown aside his coat and boots.
A loose dressing gown falls aside from his
chest, and his feet encased in slippers are
placed near the fire. A man of regular
features
,
brown hair, eyes of clear deep blue, and
a lip that gives a light like a ray from heaven
to his face whenever he smiles.
The wife is a woman, or rather a girl, of
only nineteen years. Her form is enveloped
in a loose gown of a light azure color, which,
with its flowing folds, conceals rather than
discloses
the outlines of her shape. Along her
pale face stray loosened curls of golden hair,
and beneath the arch of her brows shine eyes
that are as blue as a cloudless heaven. Her
hands and feet are small; her cheek pale but
transparent as alabaster; her neck elegantly
shaped and white as a snow-flake.
Altogether, it is a beautiful picture. You
can imagine for yourselves the details of this
room. The walls covered with a plain paper,
the floor concealed by a carpet of rich warm
coloring, the mahogany stand on which the
candle is placed, and the mirror which, hung
near the old clock, reflects the face of the
husband
,
as he looks into the eyes of his wife.
They are listening to the beating of the
storm upon the window pane. As each gust
of wind dies away, they are looking into the
fire, and from the very coals framing some
picture
dear to memory. The wife suffers her
mild eyes to rest for a moment upon her
slumbering
Boy, and the Husband turns his gaze
from the cheerful fire to the glowing face of his
Wife. Altogether, this scene is very quiet;
entirely common-place in its character, such a
scene in fact as may be witnessed in ten
thousand homes by the light of a winter's fire.
At length the Husband broke the deep
stillness
,
which had prevailed for a quarter of an
hour, by an exclamation:
God bless us, Alice! he said, fixing his
eyes upon the fire with a dreamy gaze: How
time flies! Here, in this quiet home, three
years ago, we were married. Three years!
And yet it seems but yesterday. Don't you
remember, Alice, that it was our intention to
have been married in the large mansion in
Arch street, but you preferred this quiet
country seat of Oakleaf?
It is so beautiful in summer time,
responded
Alice in a whisper, as she passed her
hand through the curls of her sleeping boy:
and even in winter, when all is bleak and
dreary. It is so pleasant to escape from the
noise and bustle of the great city, and sit down
by our quiet Oakleaf fireside. Then, you
remember
Arthur, that it was here at Oakleaf
that we first met, when we were but
children
.
Arthur rose and laid his hand upon the
golden tresses of his young wife  Here,
he whispered, bending down so that his lips
well nigh touched her cheek, so pale and
transparent
,
Here our first and only child was
born, and Alice   his words were scarcely
audible, but the pale cheek of his wife was
flushed with a glow like the day-break of a
summer day in June.
As he bent over her, she raised her face and
looked up into his eyes. Very beautiful it
was to see her gaze, as her soul  the soul of
the Mother and the Wife  seemed to pass
from her clear deep eyes into the eyes of the
Husband.
I may die. she whispered, Die in giving
life to my child. You will not forget me,
Arthur? O, how beautiful Oakleaf is in the
spring! And yet when the spring flowers
come they may bloom upon my grave!
There was a holy sadness written upon the
face of the young Wife, who, on the threshold
of the joys and anguish of maternity, spoke of
Death with a tear, and yet with a smile.
Banish these gloomy presentiments, Alice!
You will not die before me. And then, Alice,
we should always bear in mind that there is a
kind Father yonder, who guides the courses of
our life, and does all things well.
Look upon this scene with your own eyes.
Contrast the face of the young husband, with
dark brown hair, curling over the forehead,
with the countenance of the young wife, with
flowing hair of sunny gold  a countenance
chaste and womanly, in which the maiden and
the mother seem to mingle  and last of all, let
your gaze rest upon the sleeping child, where
the beauty and the thought of each face, is
reflected
as in a mirror.
Surround these three forms with the sacred
atmosphere of Home. Listen to the music of
the winter fire as it crackles and sings under
the chimney arch. Listen to the voice of the old
clock, as it throbs away in its walnut case.
Hark! The gust beats against the window,
but all within is the quiet, the unutterable peace
of Home.
What can mar the peace or wreck the
happiness of this Husband and Wife, who find
a Heaven by their winter fireside?
And after you have surveyed this scene, and
drank in its calm and unpretending sanctity,
come with me to another apartment of this
mansion of dark grey stone.
Seated beside a lamp, which breaks the
shadows of a small room, furnished after the
fashion of the Revolution, behold a young
woman of twenty-two years, whose jet-black
hair and eyes darker than midnight, give a
peculiar
beauty to a pale face, with sharp coldly
chisseled features. She wears a dark dress,
which fits closely to her neck, and envelopes a
slender but symmetrical shape. Her hand
small and death-like, with long and tapering
fingers, rests upon the mahogany table, on
which the lamp is burning, and her eyes
gleaming beneath their dark lashes, are fixed
intently upon the person seated opposite.
That person is a young man who seems
prematurely old with thought and study. His
figure long and lean, and bent as with untimely
age, is clad in the Quaker garb. Upon his
great coat of shapeless drab, hang particles of
sleet and snow, for he has but a moment since
passed from the dreary night, into the warmth
and comfort of this dimly lighted room. His
face you cannot see, for it is shadowed by an
ample hat, very broad in the rim, and with fur
like yellowish snow. With large hands clasped
upon his knees, he sits there like an ungainly
statue, his head drooped, as he converses with
the young woman in low and measured tones.
You had a stormy ride from the City?
remarked the young woman.
Truly so. It is a strange fancy that
induces friend Bayne to reside here in the
winter. I even put my horse away with my
own hands, for it seems there are no servants
at Oakleaf but thyself?
I am no servant, answered the young
woman, with a proud curl of her thin lip
I am the friend of Alice Bayne.
O! Thee sews for her, and she pays thee
with food and clothing? said the Quaker,
falling into an ungrammatical dialect, peculiar
to portions of his sect: I had forgotten.
He spoke without raising his head, but his
words were not without their effect on the
young woman. She colored from the neck
to the forehead  her bust small but beautifully
shaped, rose and fell with quick pulsations.
As you please, Doctor, she answered,
I am only a poor relation of the rich
merchant's
wife. A poor relation is something
worse than a slave. I know that.
Silence prevailed for a few moments, when
the Quaker remarked, in his whispering way
Do
they
expect me?
Alice expected
your father
, Doctor
Gatherwood, was the answer.
Ah! My father is palsied, and of course
unable to attend to his patients. I have taken
his practice off his hands. Why should Alice
expect my father on a night like this? Was I
not here, in this very house, two years ago
when her first child was born?
The speaker did not raise his head, but his
words seemed to create a singular emotion in
the mind of the listener.
Her slight frame, from the small foot to the
white neck, shook with a violent tremor. Her
features grew sharper and more compressed.
She hid her brilliant eyes with her death-like
hand.
I remember, she said in a low but
emphatic voice.
Does thee? was the answer in a lower
tone, but with an emphasis more distinct.
These words,
I remember
, and
does thee?
unmeaning as they look on paper, acquire a
deep significance from the accent and the
emotion which accompanied their utterance.
The young woman trembled as she spoke,
while the Doctor uttered the words with a
sound very much like suppressed laughter.
Does
Alice
Bayne ever speak of me?
asked the Doctor after a pause.
Never, was the answer.
Does
Arthur
Bayne ever speak of me.'
Often. As the son of old Doctor
Gatherwood
,
the friend of his father. And as
she paused, still shading her eyes with her
hand. Yet beneath the shadow of that hand,
you may see the thin nether lip quiver with a
violent tremor.
And as  the Doctor echoed, without
raising his head.
As the able and benevolent Physician,
who, two years ago, saved the life of a beloved
wife.
These words appeared to give a vast deal of
satisfaction to the Quaker. He drew a long
breath, gave utterance to an emphatic sound,
which neither sigh nor chuckle, seemed a
composition
of both, and
Ann, said he, thee may prepare me a
glass of Jamaica spirits and hot water, spiced
with a little lemon, and sweetened with sugar,
as it is very likely that I will have to sit up
all night, watching for the event which is soon
to add another blossom to the hearth of friend
Arthur.
After this exceedingly long sentence, the
Quaker drew another deep breath and spread
forth his large hands upon his bony knees,
still keeping his face within the shadow of his
broad rim.
Ann did not seem to hear his words. Her
hand over her eyes, she sat like a statue, her
bosom heaving and her lip quivering.
Does thee hear Ann? cried the Doctor in
a sharp tone.
Ann rose, and with a noiseless step left the
room. Turning his head over his shoulder,
the Doctor eyed her slender form until it
disappeared
.
He was now alone, in that quiet room,
furnished
in an old-fashioned style, with a wood
stove roaring away beneath the carved
mantel-piece
.
Still he did not change his position, nor
remove
the broad-rimmed hat from his brow.
Well  w-e-ll! he soliloquized  Truly
a Doctor's life is a troublesome affair! Night
and day one is the slave of every body who
chooses to summon one from the dinner table
or the comfortable bed. Arthur here is very
rich, and loves his wife with an affection that
is truly idolatrous. Indeed they are a comely
couple.
At this moment Ann returned, and held
before
the Doctor an antique silver bowl, carved
all over with flowers and Cupids, and
steaming
with some fragrant liquid, which poetically
might be called nectar, but more familiarly is
designated Rum Punch.
The Doctor seemed to gaze intently into her
pale face, as she extended the bowl, in her
delicate
hand.
Take it Reuben, she said quicklyOh!
such a headache as I have! She pressed her
unoccupied hand against her forehead.
Reuben took the bowl, and seemed
beneath
the shadows of that ponderous hat  to
inhale the combined fragrance of rum, lemon,
and sugar, with all the nostrils of his soul.
At the same instant Ann glided toward the
door by which she had entered, but passed for
a single moment behind the back of the Doctor,
pressing her finger to her lip, while her dark
brows met in a frown. It was a picture. The
lean Doctor in Quaker garb, calmly inhaling
the fragrance of the steaming bowl, while
behind
him stood that slender form, with a pale
face, darkened by an emotion which looked
like the intensity of hatred or of fear.
Ann where is thee? asked Reuben,
without
turning his head.
She glided to the door, opened it with a
sudden jar, and exclaimed in a careless tone
Did you speak, Reuben? I was about going
up stairs to see Alice for a moment
Very good. And thee may give my best
wishes to Alice and Arthur, and don't forget to
say that I am here. Thee understands?
Yes, Reuben, said Ann, and with that
word she left the room.
Dr. Reuben Gatherwood was alone.
For a moment he listened to the subdued
echo of the young woman's footsteps as she
ascended the stairs. After that moment was
passed, all was breathlessly still once more.
The sleet was heard beating at intervals against
the shutters, and the wood-stove beneath the
mantel -piece sung away, with a low
simmering
sound.
Reuben rose from the chair, and advancing
to the bureau which stood in the shadows in
one corner, he held his hand for an instant
over a capacious silver pitcher. When he
returned
to the light again, he held the
punch-bowl
in his hand, but it was empty.
Bending to the lamp  his face shadowed
by the broad rim you will remember he
intently examined the interior of the silver
bowl. And at the bottom of the bowl appeared
a white sediment, very thin, and scarce
perceptible
,
had it not been for the strong ray of
the lamp, shining into the glittering interior of
the vessel.
Dr. Reuben Gatherwood uttered an emphatic
humph!
Truly his sugar is exceedingly white,
he murmured  only the flavor is very
peculiar
.
Reuben quietly placed the silver cup
beneath
the table, and without removing his hat,
drew a book from his pocket, and began to read
by the light of the lamp. As leaning back in
his chair he peruses the pages of the volume,
the light shines upon the lower part of his face.
You can discover a wide mouth with almost
imperceptible lips, and a chin remarkable for
its massive outline. The lips move in a
peculiar
smile as Dr. Reuben reads; a smile
which indicative of neither joy nor sorrow,
conveys a meaning which strikes you with an
unpleasant sensation, but which you in vain
attempt to define.
Truly these French writers are a very
singular race, soliloquized Reuben as he read:
Now here is a work by an eminent French
Physician, with annotations on the margin by a
Preacher of this city. The work itself displays
considerable science, but the annotations are
exceedingly curious. For instance
Reuben
reads aloud, but in suppressed voice, the
passage which follows
Hark! a cry, very low but full of agony, resounds
through the Home. For the first time that sound
disturbs
the stillness of a Home which Marriage has made
sacred to the eye of God. It is the wail of the young
wife, who struggling in the agonies of motherhood, is
about to give life to a first child. That sound only
strikes upon the ears of the libertine to produce a sneer
or a laugh. Brutal in his estimate of woman at all
times, he regards her sacred agonies, when she is
passing
from the Wife into the Mother, with cold
indifference
,
or a ribald jest. At this time, however, Woman
is a spectacle for the reverence of men and angels. Her
love consecrated by marriage, is now ripening fast into
the fruit of a New Life. She is on the eve of giving
birth to a NEW SOUL. She may yield her life a holy
gift to her new born babe. She may survive, but
volumes cannot depict, after what a chaos of pain and
agony. At this epoch of the life of woman, what is the
5
course of your modern civilization? At this crisis of
life and death, too often of
life out of death
, how does
the custom of the world treat this woman, who a year
ago was Maiden, who has been sacred and sealed to all
but the eye of a Husband? It introduces a Stranger
into the marriage chamber. It invests that Stranger
with powers that far exceed what the most bigoted
Protestant attributes to the Roman Catholic Priest.
And to this Strange Man, society entrusts the life, and
more than life, the purity of the Wife and Mother.
And
Truly that is very fine! remarked Doctor
Reuben, when he had completed this passage.
We men of the Medical profession are
fearful
people. Yet let me read further
Why should not Woman be prepared by education
to fill the place which now is occupied by the Male
Physician? Do you say that she is not capable of
receiving
such an education? The history of the world,
the very fact of woman's organization, gives you the lie.
How many thousands that are unmarried, or that are
widowed, might by a reform in the opinions of the
social
world, be elevated into the position of Ministering
Angels by the couch of Maternity!
How many! echoed Doctor Reuben,
while his thin lips curled with a frightful sneer
That is the question? Truly it seems to
me, that society might find this out some day.
But until it does find it out, the world will wag
as usual. Women who are unmarried, or who
are widowed, may slave for nine pence a day,
or take up the life and the wages of
prostitution
.
But the idea of educating women into
Doctors  is it not absurd? The public think
so. Is not the public the best judge.
Again
Doctor Reuben read another passage:
How often have we seen THE
Doctor
, seated in his
easy chair, bottle in hand, and a few chosen boon
companions
round him, telling with many a sneer and
obscene
jest, the secrets of some Home into which he has
been admitted as a professional visiter! As a Student
this Physician learned his art by practicing in the huts
of the poorest of the poor. As a Doctor he gains
admittance
into the households of the respectable and the
rich. Husband! you are wont to welcome the Doctor
as your best friend. Listen to him now, as he tells in
detail the agonies of your wife, and for the amusement
of his bottle companions, pollutes with every elaboration
of a libertine fancy, the dearest sanctities of your Home.
Wife! you look to the Doctor as the saviour of your
life; he aided you in the hour of life and death; he
lifted you from death into life; he saved the child of
your bosom. Behold this same Doctor as he leaves
your home, and enters the room in which the friends of
his leisure hours await him. Hark! to the laughter as
he tells his pleasant story, and turns the anguish of
your maternity into a brothel joke.
This is bitter! soliloquized Doctor
Reuben
.
Truly these annotations flatter my
profession. Yet hold  here is another note
in pencil
How many homes have been poisoned forever by the
treachery of an eminent, long trusted, and even
sanctimonious
Physician! Do you blame him, Husband?
Reflect. It is yourself that have tempted him. You
have placed life, honor, purity in his hands, and then
wonder that he betrays them all. If the dark history
of women's degradation were truly written, how many
cases of lost purity should we trace home to the
treachery of a confidential physician!
Very well! was the exclamation of
Doctor
Reuben  Worse and worse! What will
not these Physicians do?
Doctor Reuben laughed and read on:
There is but one remedy. Respect that modesty
which is an eternal barrier between Woman and
dishonor
.
Let no man cross the last and most sacred
retreat
of your Home. Let no libertine sneer, let no
oracular dogma uttered by a renowned Professor, shake
you from your purpose. Woman, and none but
Woman
,
is the proper Physician by the couch of
Motherhood
.
But thee forgets, my good annotator, that
Woman is a being of inferior intellect, was
the commentary of Doctor Reuben. Doth
not society think so? Should we not be foolish
indeed, did we refuse to believe what society
preaches?
Woman can be educated, and well educated in the
most difficult branches of the Medical profession. The
day is coming when the introduction of a Strange Man
into the Home, will be looked upon as an act of
shameless
insult to the Wife, yes, as a crime only second to
dishonor itself.
Doctor Reuben placed the book in his pocket
again, for he heard a footstep in the entry.
In an instant Ann Clarke entered the room.
As she came near the light it might be seen that
her pale face indicated an effort to suppress a
violent agitation.
Doctor, she said, resting her hand on
the back of his chair, I trust you found your
warm drink palatable?
The Doctor did not turn his head, much
less glance toward the speaker, as he replied
It was indeed pleasant. I thank thee,
Ann. How do our friends come on up
stairs?
Ann bent her head, and whispered in his
ear.
Ah! indeed  so soon! he exclaimed,
and rising from the chair, left the room with a
hurried step.
And then Ann Clarke, left alone, sank into
the chair which he had occupied, and clasping
her hands, exclaimed aloud
God help me! That I should be in the
power of a man like this!
It is impossible to depict the intense anguish
of her pallid face. The features were
sharpened
as with the touch of death; her eyes
flashed with feverish light.
But, she said slowly, his career is
almost done.
She paced the floor with irregular steps
now pausing as if the act of listening, now
turning a horror-stricken countenance toward
the light.
What matter, she murmured incoherently
A life like his only curses the earth. It
is no harm to destroy a noxious reptile.
She paused, and glanced around the room,
from the table to the side-board.
The cup, what has he done with the cup?
Ere she had time to solve this question, the
door opened and Arthur Bayne entered the
room. His countenance was pale and
troubled
.
Go up stairs, Ann, he whispered, sinking
in the chair which the Doctor and the young
woman had occupied by turns  Quick, Ann,
for God's sake! There is no time to be
lost.
Ann hurried to the door, and as suddenly
retraced her steps:
Mr. Bayne, she said with a face utterly
colorless, and a voice that trembled in every
accent: I have an important revelation to
make to you
Arthur looked up with a mingled look of
impatience and wonder  To-morrow, Ann,
to-morrow I will talk with you   he said
with a hasty gesture.
To-morrow will be too late
Ann, Ann, would you have me sacrifice the
life of Alice, for the sake of any revelation,
however important? cried Arthur, his face
flushing with anger  Up stairs at once, and
for God's sake!
At this moment Ann caught a glimpse of the silver cup which the Doctor had concealed
beneath
the table.
He has not drank, she exclaimed aloud,
wringing her hands, as her face was stamped
with an inexpressible dismay.
Arthur looked upon her as one would
survey
a lunatic.
Why Ann, what can be the matter with
you? Who has not drank? What mean
you?
Nothing, nothing, she replied hastily;
You know I was watching very late last
night, and I am feverish for want of sleep. I
will go up stairs without delay. Poor Alice!
How could I be so thoughtless as to attempt to
converse with you, on a matter which can just
as well be told to-morrow!
She left the room without another word.
The young Husband would have thought
strangely of her broken words, and her
hesitation
,
at any other than the present time, but
now the extremity of his wife absorbed every
faculty of his soul.
Doctor Reuben is indeed a tried Physician
and a faithful friend. He repeated these
words very often in a low tone.
Then resting his arm upon the table, and
supporting his cheek in his hand, he gazed
upon the floor witth a look of the keenest
anxiety, the most harrowing suspense. The
moisture started from his forehead; he pressed
his lip between his teeth, and  wrung by the
agitation of mind and body  even bit his nails
until the blood started from his finger-ends.
If Alice should die! he exclaimed
repeatedly
If Alice should die!
For three hours the Husband kept his weary
watch, and after a world of suspense and
mental
torture, he heard a low footstep in the
entry.
Ann entered the room  her face was
deathly pale.
Speak, cried Arthur, in the tone of a
frenzied man  Alice  she is not dead?
Alice surrives, answered Ann in a
whisper
Come up stairs and look upon the
new-born child.
CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.
THE HISTORY TOLD BY THE DYING WOMAN.
PART II.
Not many moments after this scene. Doctor
Reuben and the young woman entered the room
on the lower floor together. The Doctor had
assumed his overcoat and broad-rimmed hat;
he was evidently prepared for a journey.
You do not intend to return home to-night
Doctor, said the young woman, as she paused
near the door, while he advanced toward the
light.
Certainly; I have many patients to attend
to, early in the morning, was the reply
By-the-bye, Ann, will thee brew me another
warm drink. Yet hold  come here friend
Ann
As he lifted the broad rimmed hat from his
head, the young woman advanced to the light.
For the first time we can gaze freely upon Dr.
Reuben's face. The forehead is wide, but the
top of his head is perfectly flat. The eyes are
large, in color a cold glassy azure, and
protruding
until they are in a line with his brows.
Add to these features, a nose bold and
prominent
,
a wide mouth with thin lips, a chin large
and square, and you will have a faint idea of
the peculiar expression of Dr. Reuben's face.
As the young woman came within the circle
of the light, it might be seen, that her eyes
unnaturally
bright, shone from a face which was
stamped with a corpse-like pallor.
Ann Clarke, and as he spoke in a sweet
and even voice, the Doctor's protruding eyes
emitted a glance which penetrated the young
woman to the soul  Ann Clarke I have a
word to say to thee. When a young woman,
unmarried, has placed herself in a Doctor's
power,
by destroying a life which is the fruit
of her passions
does thee hear?
Ann with her eyes cast to the floor, stood
trembling from head to foot. She was silent.
Why in that case, Ann Clarke, the young
woman aforesaid, should never think of mixing
any
white dust
with the punch of the Doctor
aforesaid. Does thee understand? Especially
if that white dust should look and smell like
arsenic. Do my words seem plain to thee?
Before these words were completed Ann
fell at his feet, her eyes closed, her limbs
stiffened, as if in death.
Laughing heartily to himself, Doctor Reuben
resumed his broad brim, and left the room and
the house. In a few moments the sound of
his horse's hoofs echoed on the midnight air.
When Ann recovered her senses, she found
Arthur Bayne bending over her, his cheeks
flushed, his eyes brilliant with an unnatural
joy.
Give me joy, my friend, he cried, Give
me joy. Alice survives, and her child will
also live. But you are worn out: this late
watching has been too much for you. Take
a little sleep Ann  I myself will watch while
you sleep. Dr. Reuben told me that I need
have no fear for Alice
Assisted by the hand of Arthur Bayne, the
young woman rose from the floor, and took
her seat by the table, by the light of the waning
lamp.
God bless us! What ails you Ann? and
Arthur started back at the sight of her face.
You are terribly changed within an hour. I
scarce can recognize you
Ann, whose face stamped with a livid
pallor
,
was compressed in every line, as with the
resolution of despair, raised her lack-lustre
eyes to the face of the young Merchant, and
said in a low voice
Sit by me for a few moments, Mr. Bayne,
and I will tell you all.
Her tone filled Arthur with a feeling of
terror
which he could not analyze.
All? What mean you?
All, she continued, And when all is told,
you may spurn me from your doors, or
murder
me if you like, but speak I must, and
now.
Clad as he was in a dressing gown, the
young Husband sank in a chair, his noble face
manifesting a sudden interest in every
lineament
.
When you were married, Arthur Bayne,
some three years ago, your wife gave me, her
poor relation, a home
Do not speak of it Ann. You have been
to Alice friend, nurse, and sister. Rather
speak of the vast debt of kindness we  Alice,
myself, our children  owe to you.
A smile crossed the young woman's face.
Such a smile, as reminds you of sunshine
playing over the face of a corse.
A vast debt, indeed! she continued, with
an accent of singular bitterness  Hear me
first, and then you can estimate the amount of
this debt at your leisure.
With a voice that never faltered, and an eye
that never once changed its glassy lustre, Ann
Clarke, the poor relation, then uttered these
words:
This is no time for woman's modesty;
this is not the hour for maidenly shame. You
think me a pure and innocent girl. Know
once for all that I am a lost and guilty woman.
Nay! Do not start, and gather that look of
incredulity
upon your face. Hear me  I shall
be brief  and then form your own judgment.
It is not for myself that I care, but for
you
and
yours
Ann! You are surely in a dream
A little while before your marriage, I
became
acquainted with a young man who
bore the name of Lemuel Gardiner. It was
before my mother died, when I lived in a
narrow
court, and attempted to gain bread and
shelter by the hard slavery of the needle. This
Gardiner was a young man  not without
good looks, and yet not pre-eminent for manly
beauty. But his voice was low and smooth;
his eyes always shone with an expression of
quiet sympathy. He became  it matters not
how  a visiter to our home. He won my
love. We were then too poor to think of
marriage. He was the only friend I had in
the world. Blame me if you will, taunt me
with my shame, but the truth must be told. I
became his, and
without marriage
.
An expression of wonder and compassion
stole over Arthur's face.
Poor as I was, I had yet rich relations,
who would be horror-stricken at the story of
my shame. Poor as I was, I yet feared the
jibe and the scorn of the great world. While
my shame was a secret in my own home, I
did not care for the morrow. But at the same
moment, when I became conscious that a new
life was throbbing within my breast, I was
told by my lover that he could never redeem
my shame, with a marriage vow. He was a
Priest. Lemuel Gardiner was a name assumed
for the occasion. He was a Priest of my own
Church
A Priest! It is incredible! A Priest of
the Catholic Church
Spare that look and accent of horror. He
was indeed a Priest, at the time of which I
speak, but since then, he has been degraded
from the service of the Altar. He is now, if I
mistake not, a Convert to the Protestant
Church, full of hatred to `the Pope,' and
overflowing
with gall at the mere mention of
`idolatrous Rome'
I think I have heard of the man, muttered
the listener.
This lover told me that he could not marry
me. But he would spare me the anguish of
bringing into life a child, leprous from the hour
of its birth with the brand of its Mother's
shame. In a word, he brought to my humble
dwelling in the narrow court, a very dear
friend, whom he called Dr. Reuben
Gatherwood
Reuben Gatherwood! ejaculated Arthur,
in a tone of unfeigned amazement.
Her voice sank low, and deeper as she went
on. Many times her livid face was overspread
by flushes of burning scarlet. More than once
she veiled her eyes, while her lips still
continued
that narration of dishonour and despair.
And thus, she exclaimed, after the
nameless
tragedy of her life had been told: Thus
deserted by Lemuel Gardiner, the forsworn
Priest, I became the bound Slave of Dr.
Reuben
Gatherwood. A word from Dr. Reuben
could at any moment blast me with the name
of MURDERESS! From the hour which Dr.
Reuben entered my home, until this moment,
I have been his slave.
Reuben Gatherwood! I cannot  cannot
believe it; and the merchant looked with
vague incredulity into the face of the agitated
woman. But Ann, said he, kindly taking
her hand within his own, The past is with
the past. Do not think that I have for you
any emotion that approaches to condemnation
or contempt. What need to make this
revelation
of your life to me?
Because it concerns you, and none other,
replied Ann, in an emphatic tone.
I am in the dark; I cannot see the drift of
your words
You will know, alas! too soon  Ann
hid her face in her hands.
The young Merchant did not seem to hear
her words. A smile that was born at the
fountains of a generous heart, gave a new life
to his handsome face.
And as to Dr. Reuben Gatherwood, he will
never breathe a whisper of this early
misfortune
,
he exclaimed. He is not the man to
abuse the confidence of any living thing.
Reflect for a moment, said Ann, in a tone
of peculiar emphasis. For two years Dr.
Reuben Gatherwood has (in the absence of his
aged father) been the confidential Physician of
your home. For two years has Ann Clarke
been an inmate of your house.
Arthur could not understand the expression
which came over the young woman's face.
Her cheeks became more and more death-like,
while her eyes flashed with dazzling light.
Her accent was clear and distinct; every word
from her lips seemed invested with a peculiar
and hidden meaning.
I am in the dark yet, Ann, murmured
Arthur.
You have doubtless often heard the
enemies
of the Roman Church speak in terms of
the utmost horror concerning the influence
which the Priest exercises in every Catholic
family. And yet what is the influence, what
is the power of the Priest, compared to the
confidential Physician? Once I heard it said,
that a just Physician was the truest Minister
of God on earth. Familiar with ailments of
the body and mind, he can administer to the
wants of both, while the Priest only pretends
to care for the Soul. Can you imagine the
power of evil which rests in the hands of the
corrupt Physician?
You speak in enigmas, answered Arthur,
smiling in spite of himself, at the earnestness
and gravity of the young woman: Upon my
word, Ann, I cannot fathom your meaning.
Enigmas! Alas, that an evil like that
which I am about to describe, cannot be spoken
of in any other way than by hints and
whispers
.
She paused, and her eyes assumed again
that vague and dreamy lustre. Bending
forward
,
Arthur earnestly perused each feature of
her pallid face, as if to wrench from her looks
the hidden meaning of her words.
The woman is mad, he muttered to
himself
;
The story of her fault is only the fancy
of a bewildered brain.
Listen, she said quietly, and then
commenced
a narrative, which held Arthur Bayne
enchained for the space of half an hour.
CHAPTER FOURTEENTH.
THE HISTORY TOLD BY THE DYING WOMAN.
PART III.
Mark the sudden changes of his face, hear
the broken exclamations which escape between
his set teeth, and then as the very apathy of
horror gathers over his every lineament, guess
if you can  if you dare  the nature of the
narrative, that now falls word by word into his
soul.
At last the narrative was told.
I do not curse you, said Arthur in a
changed voice, Nor do I charge this crime
upon your head.
The young woman regarded with terror this
unnatural calmness of look and tone.
Pity, for God's sake pity! she cried
falling on her knees.
But he turned away, and with an uneven
step left the room. The agony of a lost soul
was gnawing at his heart, but his face was
calm as marble, and as colorless. No groan
came from his lips, as he passed along the dark
entry and ascended the stairs. He hesitated
for a moment, when he stood upon the threshold
of his wife's chamber, but gathering strength
for the effort  an effort that in his present
state of mind demanded superhuman strength
he pushed open the door and crossed the
threshold.
A taper standing upon a side-table, flung a
faint light upon the gathered curtains of a bed.
Those curtains were like the driven snow, and
from their folds appeared a small white hand,
whose delicate outlines were distinctly drawn
upon the silken coverlet.
You cannot see his face, as he approaches
the bed and looks within. A wife and her
new born babe are slumbering there, but the
curtains hide them from our sight.
He for a moment conceals his face among
their folds, and then lifts the white hand to his
lips.
Without a word he passes from the room.
The Mother is sleeping with her new-born
child upon her breast  whither tend the
footsteps
of the Husband and the Father?
Ann, frightened by the terrible calmness of
his manner, has passed from the lower room
into the entry. In the dark she is waiting
listening. She does not watch very long,
before a step is heard descending the stairs.
A figure wrapped in a cloak with many capes
hurries by her, and the next instant she hears
the front door open and shut, with a stealthy
sound. The figure is gone. The young
woman would fain hurry to the door, and
arrest his steps, but she is palsied. She has
lost for the moment the power of motion and
speech.
In the dark she stands, clutching her throat,
as though in the attempt to crush the agony,
which swells in a torrent of fire, from her
heart to her brain.
Hark! The beat of hoofs upon the road,
in front of the door  for a moment the sound
is heard distinctly  and then it whirls away
and mingles with the blast.
My God! He is gone! ejaculates the
young woman  Whither? For what
purpose
?
The wind is howling around the quiet
Oakleaf home. The sleet is beating against
the upper window pane. In the room, where
a dim light is glimmering, sleeps the Mother and
her babe. The rosy boy, is slumbering too,
within that soundless mansion. The fire on
the hearth is burning low, but the old clock
throbs on  the only sound within those dark
grey walls.
Look yonder on the road which leads toward
the Schuylkill, and toward the haze now
glimmering
over the distant city. A horseman
with closely muffled form is spurring on,
through mire and snow, with the cold blast
beating full upon his uncovered brow. He
does not once look back, though Oakleaf, and
a Mother and her babe, are slumbering there.
Toward the city, with mad haste he flies,
spurring his horse, as though he would fill the
generous animal with some portion of the
spirit now boiling in his own veins.
Change the scene for a moment to Arch
Street, where a line of lofty mansions, break
indistinctly into the leaden sky. A horseman
comes madly along the street; he flings his
steed back on his haunches, before a door,
which by the light of a neighboring lamp,
glitters with a broad silver plate.
Dr. Reuben Gatherwood
is the name
inscribed upon that plate.
The horseman dismounts. Muffled in his
heavy cloak, he ascends the marble steps, and
in an instant the bell is in his grasp. Hark!
How that sound echoes through the lofty
chambers of the mansion!
After a brief delay the door is opened, and a
servant clad in the Quaker garb appears.
I wish to see young Dr. Gatherwood on
an errand of life and death.
Shading his eyes from the street lamp, the
servant regards this muffled form for a few
moments with a wondering look.
Thee cannot see him, for truly he is not
in the house.
Where can I find him? was the next
question, in a quiet but impatient voice.
Well  now  he has so many patients
truly  stammered the servant.
Quick! I tell you man it is on a mission
of life and death, cried the muffled figure.
It is very late  truly it must be near
morning. I rather think thee can find young
Dr. Reuben at
He hesitated, and surveyed the stranger with
a cautious glance.
Where? and a vigorous hand was laid
upon the servant's shoulder. Lose no time,
but tell me at once
Thee is a very rude man, I must say.
Thee can find Dr. Reuben at his Dissecting
Room
And that is
In an old building, fourth story, in an alley
that runs from Second to Third, below
Chesnut
.
The horseman on his steed again, urges him
with word and spur, and through the sleet and
mire, the sparks fly from the horse's hoofs.
It is an alley narrow and dark, and in the
day-time the sun-beam may scarcely struggle
down between these high and gloomy walls.
It is, at this moment of the night, as silent and
deserted as the grave itself. From yonder
window in the fourth story, a ray flickers out,
and dies in the sleety air. Let us ascend to
that window, and look within its dingy panes.
It is a long and narrow room. Furniture
there is none. The walls are high, the ceiling
black with smoke, the floor spotted with blotches,
and the solitary window, half covered with a
ragged curtain. The atmosphere is dense and
sickening. In the centre, stands a large table
of unpainted pine, and upon this table burns
a lamp, which emits a small flame, obscured
by a cloud of smoke.
By the table, or rather bending over it,
behold
a lean figure, with a black muslin apron
bound across his narrow chest. The sleeves
of his shirt, for he has thrown his coat aside,
are spotted with blood red stains. In one
hand he holds a small instrument of steel,
glittering through the blood which drips
from its slender blade. His homely face, is
agitated by an unnatural enthusiasm; his eyes,
protruding at all times, now seem about to start
from their sockets. His lips, thin and wide,
are tightly compressed, and his hard deep
breathing, may be heard through the whole
extent of the long narrow room. His forehead
glitters with large beads of moisture. He is
entirely absorbed in the task, which has called
him to this lonely room.
Upon the table, beneath the gaze of his
protruding
eyes, lies stretched the body of a human
being. Only yesterday that body was the
casement of a woman's soul: now, by the ray
of the smoky lamp, behold the casket from
which the eternal spark has fled.
Alas! Alas! Not even the grave was a
resting place for you, poor Daughter of the
Poor! Many times, in want and misery you
wished for Death, and prayed God for the
resting place of a quiet grave. There, after
hunger, cold, sin and despair, you would at
last, be at peace. They buried you only
yesterday
in Potter's Field. They crushed your
limbs, into the rude coffin, and laid you to rest,
without a word or prayer, but with the music
of a rattling spade and a falling clod. But even
in the grave, rest is denied you. You died
poor  science now demands your Corpse. It
is necessary for Science and the world, that
even the unblest mould of Potter's field,
should be stripped from your unpainted coffin.
The rough lid is tore aside, and your form
grasped by the hand of wretches, who are
forced to earn a dollar in this way, is
huddled
into a cart, and borne through the
populous
city to the inner Temple of Science
the Dissecting Room. It must be a comfort to
you, Poor Woman, to think that all this is
done in the cause of Science  Science that
did so much for you and yours, while life was
in your veins.
And over this corpse, like the Ghoul of
eastern
legend over its loathsome meal, hung Dr.
Reuben Gatherwood, with sharpened knife
and gloating eye.
Immortality of the soul  let me cut the
body into a thousand pieces  shall I find any
proof of it here? Thus soliloquized Dr.
Reuben, as he bent over the corpse; Truly
the great Frenchman, Broussais, was right!
Let me dissect these nerves, and I will show
the cause
of all sensibility. A cut or two at
the viscera will reveal
the cause
of all passion.
As for the mind it is only a
secretion
of the
brain. Truly the scalpel is a great Teacher!
Reuben belonged to that class of Physicians
who open the casket from which a diamond
has been stolen, and demonstrate from the very
structure of the casket, that it never contained
a diamond at all. In other words, after the
soul has left its casement, Reuben seeks for it,
by rending into pieces, the body from which
it has fled.
Reuben was an Atheist. With all his
knowledge
of Science, the veriest Child babbling
amid its toys, could have taught him a Science
as far above his own, as the canopy of heaven
is above the kennel. The Child
can believe
.
Reuben was
incapable of belief
.
Broussais was right, said Reuben,
passing
his knife along the brow of the dead.
Matter is God, and God is matter
At this moment, the light was extinguished.
How we cannot tell, but it went out, as though
the wick had been snapt by a pistol shot.
Truly, cried Reuben, as he found himself
alone in the dark with the dead  Truly
this is singular
Then a weapon descended upon Reuben's
skull, with all the force of an arm nerved by
frenzy. It was the stock of a pistol, or
perchance
a knotted club, but it did not give
Reuben
much time for thought. In the thick dark
it descended upon Reuben's head, his breast,
his shoulders. He made an attempt to grapple
with his unseen enemy. In the attempt he
fell backward upon the table, and upon the
breast of the corpse. He lay struggling there,
while the club or pistol stock, continued to
rain its blows upon him. Reuben moaned,
cursed, pleaded, but still the work went on.
Beaten to a jelly, his face streaming blood, his
limbs mangled, Reuben endeavoured to rise
from the corpse and battle with his unseen
enemy.
Devil! he gasped, Does thee mean to
murder me?
An iron instrument struck him on the skull,
with terrible, yes, fatal force.
Reuben struggled no more.
On the table, side by side with the dead
woman, he lay, while a hand was inserted
beneath
his vest, next to his heart.
Does the heart still beat?
The hand is withdrawn, and a step is heard
followed by the jar of a door.
Late in the afternoon of the next day, a
brother Physician entered the Dissecting Room,
and found the mangled body of Dr. Reuben
stretched beside the woman's corpse. It was
a ghastly and repulsive spectacle.
On the morning of the next day, a riderless
horse stood covered with foam before the door
of the Oakleaf mansion.
And on a rock, beside the Schuylkill, a blue
cloak and cap were found by a fisherman who
was wandering near the shore. They were
recognized, by a letter in the cap, as the
property of Arthur Bayne.
For many days Philadelphia rung with the
details of two sad and painful events.
Dr. Reuben Gatherwood has been assailed
by assasins while in his study, and is now
lingering
at the point of death.
Arthur Bayne, one of our first Merchants,
was drowned in the Schuylkill by the fright of
an unmanageable horse.
These topics supplied matter for the
discussion
of the gossips of the street and the
press, for at least three days.
Three days have passed. We stand once
more in the chamber of Alice Bayne. The
curtains are drawn, the place is very still, a
faint taper is burning by the bed.
From the next room you hear the smothered
voice of mourning. No relatives are gathered
there, neither father nor mother, sister nor
friends  none watching for the last moment
of the dying Mother, save a solitary woman,
whose tears fell unseen by any human eye.
But in this chamber all is still. Once the
bridal chamber, then the chamber of
motherhood
,
it is now the chamber of death. She
has been dying for three days. Ever since the
word of her Husband's death reached her ears,
she has been sinking slowly into the shadow
of Eternity.
Soon the mystery of her life will be
revealed
.
CHAPTER FIFTEENTH.
THE HISTORY TOLD BY THE DYING WOMAN.
PART IV.
Ann, said a low voice within the curtains
of the bed, Has
he
come?
But there was no answer to the question.
For no living being was within sound of the
dying mother's voice.
Bring Harry to me, Ann. Bring him at
once. I must see him once more before I leave
you all.
Again the voice of Alice was unanswered.
But soon, from the door leading into the
next room, there comes with stealthy tread, a
young woman whose slender form, is enveloped
in a black dress. Her face, pale at all times,
is now furrowed with the traces of burning
tears. In her arms she carries the Boy, with
clear blue eyes, and sunny golden hair.
And the little fellow, unconscious of evil or
death, struggles in her arms, and laughs gaily
as he looks up into her pale, haggard face.
I will go to pa's room, he exclaims in
infantile
tones, as he endeavours to release
himself
from her embrace. He
is
home. I
know he is. There now  don't you tell a
story, you naughty Ann.
Hush! Child! Your mother  your poor,
mother is very, very sick  whispers Ann
as she surveys his laughing face with a sigh.
Ann, are you there? exclaims a low
voice.
Ann slowly draws the curtains, and the light
streams dimly in upon the dying mother and
her babe. The face of the mother, half buried
in the silken pillow, is colorless, save a tint of
red on her cheek. Her eyes, large and bright,
and impassioned with a mother's love, are
turned toward the young woman, who stands
beside her bed. One hand, white as marble,
6
is laid upon the coverlet; the other rests upon
her babe, whose tiny face, smiles in the light,
from the opposite side of the bed.
Ma! Ma! Let me see my little siss,
cries the Boy, clapping his hands, and making
an effort to spring from the arms of Ann, upon
the bed.
A tear stole down the cheek of the young
Mother.
Hold him near to me Ann. There, she
pressed a kiss upon the lips of her boy
Go to bed, now, that's a good Harry. In
the morning you shall see me  shall he not,
Ann?
With a faint smile she uttered these words,
as her white hand wondered through the golden
locks of her boy.
Ann could not restrain a burst of tears. For
when morning comes, this young mother will
be dead. The first sunbeam that steals through
the window pane, will only light her white
lips and glassy eyes.
When I am dead  you remember, Ann
your promise?
I will  I will, said the young woman
amid her sobs, I will take care of Harry and
be a mother to your new-born babe.
What is `
dead?
' asked the boy, turning
his large eyes from face to face.
You talked with old Doctor Gatherwood,
when he was here to-day? whispered Alice
He told you that I could not last till
morning
!
The young woman could not answer. This
preternatural calmness of the dying mother,
affected her with an agony too deep for words.
Don't cry, cousin, whispered Alice  I
shall soon be with Arthur. And she lifted
her eyes, with an expression of rapture, which
you never see, save on a face, which has been
touched by the holy hand of Death.
Ann could no longer gaze upon the scene.
She hurried from the room, bearing the boy in
her arms. As she crossed the threshold, he
looked over her shoulder, and clapped his
hands, and said with a tone that we in vain
endeavour to depict
Morrow, Ma! Morrow I will see you!
The next moment the young mother was
alone once more, with her sleeping babe.
She spoke her thoughts in words, as she
gazed vacantly upon the dim light.
Arthur and I were orphans, when we
married. His relations live far, far away, and
mine cannot reach the city until I am dead.
Then it storms so, that our friends in the city,
cannot come in time to bid me farewell. Ann
is a good friend. She will be a mother to my
children.
That
takes the bitterest sting away.
Arthur! Arthur I will not be long
Once more Ann entered the room, and on
tip-toe approached the bedside. In a low voice,
she told the dying one, that a number of friends
the friends of the husband and of herself
had just arrived, and were impatient to see
her for the last time.
Let them come up. Yet stay  has
he
arrived?
He! Of whom do you speak!
When old Dr. Gatherwood was here this
afternoon, I besought him to send me a
Minister
.
You know, that neither Arthur nor
myself
were members of any church. Had I
my life to live over again, I would more
faithfully
attend to the service of God. Has
he
come  speak  I would not die, without a
prayer?
These words, spoken with great effort,
caused a singular change in the listener's
countenance
.
She stood with her back to the light,
and therefore the dying one could not see the
shadow which came suddenly over her brow.
A Minister! she exclaimed  Did you
name the Minister of a particular Church?
No  I did not. Has no one arrived?
There is a Minister down stairs, but
Why do you hesitate? and Alice raised
her eyes with an imploring look  Tell him
to come  do not refuse me, cousin.
As she spoke a third voice, interrupted the
conversation:
There is no time to be lost   the voice
was deep and sepulchral  Sister I would be
alone, for a little while, with this departing
sinner.
As though every accent of that voice, was
the poisoned sting of a loathsome reptile, Ann
turned pale, shuddered, and with a quick
movement confronted the speaker.
Lemuel Gardiner! she ejaculated, raising
her hands.
Near the light, with hands clasped on his
breast, he stood, his huge white cravat,
contrasted
with his dark attire, throwing his
marked features, into strong relief. His eyes
half closed and sunken in their sockets, his
wide mouth with deep red lips, his prominent
nose, and massive lower jaw, gave altogether a
decided expression to his face.
It is I, sister, he answered meekly.
You, and here! the young woman
confronted
him with a flashing eye.
It is, I, his voice sank into a whisper,
and his eyes were dropped meekly to the floor:
Lemuel Gardiner, once a Roman priest, in
the gall and bitterness of anti-Christ, but now
a Minister of a truly Evangelical Church. Do
you upbraid me, sister, with the sins of my
early life? Do you refuse me the privilege of
a moment's conversation with the departing
soul?
He spoke very low, but his sunken eyes,
suddenly flamed up, with a light that conveyed
a deeper meaning, than all his measured words.
Ann trembled from head to foot.
Pray! Converse! But I will  I must
remain
in this room
Must you? Lemuel slowly raised his
finger while a smile agitated his warm red lips.
Remember! Think again.
Indeed
, will
you?
Ann without another word left the room.
Lemuel surveyed the chamber of death,
with a calm and complacent look, and then
approached
the bed, on which the dying woman
rested, her decaying life soothed by a half
repose
,
between sleep and wakefulness.
Sister, you are departing, he said, as he
bent over the couch: Shall I pray with
you?
She unclosed her eyes with a vague yet
lustrous stare.
I am the Minister, Lemuel whispered.
Thanks, she murmured, lifting her hand
from the silken coverlet: Pray for me, pray
that I may soon join Arthur up yonder, pray
for the children that I am about to leave alone
in this drear world.
Lemuel knelt by the bed. He prayed.
Was it a prayer full of Love, upon whose
every accent, the dying soul might take wing,
and ascend in peace to God?
No. It was a prayer of wrath. It spoke
of a life spent in sin, of an offended God, of
an eternity of torture.
Up in the bed started the dying Alice, her
eyes flashing with terror, her breast swelling
fearfully, beneath the silken coverlet.
Hold! Hold! she cried, spreading forth
that hand, whose nails were already blue with
the chill of death.
But Lemuel prayed on. Low, but deep and
sonorous his voice swelled through the silence
of the death room. Tears streamed down his
cheeks: he clasped his hands: he seemed to
feel horror-stricken at the very doom, which
he was compelled by his duty to denounce
upon the dying sinner.
Sinner? Remember, Alice was by the
revelation
of Ann Clarke, an innocent woman.
Remember, by that revelation, Alice was
unconscious
of the treachery of young Reuben
Gatherwood.
And yet she was a sinner. A sinner lost to
hope and mercy, with nothing in prospect
beyond
the grave, but an eternity of torture.
Lemuel said so in his terrible prayer; Lemuel
with sepulchral voice, and streaming eyes, and
hands knit together, uttered words like these,
to the ear of the dying Alice.
At last, starting up in the bed, her eyes
lighted with the fires of a preternatural horror,
Alice cried in a voice that was interrupted by
gasps
O, Sir, what shall I do to escape all this?
Tell me  I must not be parted from Arthur,
in another world. Speak! Speak!
She sank back upon the pillow, panting,
trembling, her pale cheek flushed with
unnatural
color.
At once Lemuel rose. In the pocket of his
dark coat, descended his large hand. He drew
forth a portable ink-stand, which contained a
newly-mended pen, and a small phial of ink.
Sister, do you think you could sign your
name?
She turned her eyes to his face, with a
look of vague wonder.
Sign your name to a piece of paper, which
will give a small portion of your wealth, to
the sick and suffering, who are without shelter
and without bread?
He spread forth the parchment upon the
coverlet. He placed the pen in that
death-chilled
hand. It was a curious parchment,
covered with writing  writing in all kinds of
text and script  and adorned with one or
more seals attached to ribbons of a bright
azure.
Sign, Sister, and all shall go well with you
up yonder.
Placing one hand, behind her neck  among
those curls of sunny gold which escaped from
her cap  he raised her gently from the pillow,
and pointed to the parchment, as he whispered
in her ear:
`It is for the poor. It is for the suffering.
You cannot take your wealth with you.
Sign!
A faint smile played around the lips of Alice.
She gazed upon the parchment, with a large,
a very bright, but altogether vacant eye. The
light tinted with faint warm colour, her golden
hair: she looked
like death
but still very fair
and beautiful.
The pen moved in her hand. Lemuel still
lifting her from the pillow, kindly guided the
pen, as it moved along the parchment.
Alice
Bayne
that name was written in a cramped,
but very bold and legible hand.
Alice Bayne
! murmured the young
Mother, gazing vacantly at her own  and her
last signature.
Gently, Lemuel suffered her to fall back
upon the pillow. Quietly and suddenly he
signed his own name opposite the name of
Alice.
Brother Jacob, you can come in! he said
aloud.
The door opened, and a short, portly man,
dressed in dark attire, with small features in
a very large and fleshy face, stepped over the
threshold and approached the bed.
You acknowledge this to be your hand
and seal, act and deed? said Lemuel, as he
turned to Alice.
Alice smiled. It was a vague and
wandering
smile, that imparted a sad loveliness to her
face.
Yes, she exclaimed  my hand, my
own hand. Then you know I shall see
Arthur!
You hear her, Brother Jacob, said
Lemuel
to his friend. Sign your name, Brother
Jacob. Here, Brother Jacob! do you observe
what a pleasant frame of mind she is in just
now?
Brother Jacob (otherwise Jacob Something,
Esq., Attorney at Law, and Communicant of
Rev. Lemuel Gardiner's Church,) bent over
the bed, and signed his name, beneath the name
of the Preacher, in a round and clerkly hand.
At this crisis the door opened, and Ann
Clarke, once more entered the room. She
started as if stricken by a pistol shot, when she
beheld the details of this scene  the form of
Lemuel and Jacob in the foreground, with their
gaze fixed upon the parchment, which lay upon
the coverlet; while in the dim background,
appeared the sad, happy face, of the
death-stricken
Mother.
What do you here, with pen and
parchment
?
she cried suddenly, as with a single
step she reached the Preacher's side:
Lemuel
,
there is some mystery here
Only a bequest to my Church, Sister,
answered Lemuel, with a kindly smile.
That is all: a bequest to our Church,
echoed the short and portly lawyer, as he
folded the parchment and handed it to the
Minister.
Ann surveyed each face with a deep and
anxious look:
Lemuel, beware! There is a limit to
endurance
!
she whispered.
Ann, be careful! There is a limit to
sience
,
he answered.
And his look, flashing from beneath his
compressed brow, gave a singular significance
to his words.
Ann sank back, as though some inexplicable
witchcraft had at once chilled her blood, and
deprived her of the power of utterance. The
light swam before her eyes. She extended
her hand, and grasped the curtains of the bed,
and it was a moment before her entire
consciousness
returned.
She looked round, in search of the Preacher
and his friend. They had disappeared.
But over the threshold, one by one, came
the friends of the dying woman. Grave
matrons and aged men, young wives and girls
in the blush of virgin loveliness, all swarmed
into the room, anxious to take a last look at
Alice Bayne.
Alice greeted them all with an extended
hand, and a cheerful smile. For every one
she had some kindly word. And yet, as she
spoke to them, she said at the end of every
farewell  I shall soon see Arthur. Her
eyes were bright, O, all too bright for this dull
world of clay. Her voice was touched with
angelic rapture. Soon I shall see Arthur?
she never ceased to speak the words, amid
those whispered farewells.
The friends had gone: it was midnight:
Alice was sleeping with her babe, beneath the
pressure of her extended hand.
Ann, with her head buried in the coverlet,
was praying and weeping by the bed of death.
Midnight passed, and morning drew nigh.
She was sinking slowlyslowly, gently into
death  talking all the while of Arthur, of her
children, of heaven.
Take care of Harry! she said, as
morning
was dawning through the window curtains.
And, do you hear, cousin? I want my baby
called after you? Ann  Annie  you
remember
?
Ann did not raise her face, but reached forth
her hand and clasped the hand of the
departing
Mother. That hand was cold as ice.
O, can you believe it? said Alice, after a
pause, that the words which
he
spoke to me
last night are true
Ann raised her face, and saw the
countenance
of the dying woman, tinted by the first
rays of the dawn.
What words? she whispered, bending
over the bed.
About a lost Soul, and a God who was
angry, and torture after death, said Alice, in
a very low voice. You can't tell how it
frightened me
A shudder pervaded the frame of the young
woman.
Ah! Coward! Blasphemer! she
muttered
,
Hast thou been tampering with the
last hour of the dying one?
Do you think the good Lord will shut me
out of Heaven? I am only a poor weak
woman, that have loved my children better
than life. Do you think HE will be very angry
with me? Speak, Ann, speak  I am going
will it be dark, dark with me, up yonder?
It is a fearful thing to witness the departure
of a troubled soul. It is a beautiful sight
the holiest sight in all the world  to witness
the going forth of a Soul, that goes up to God,
as to a kind father. Last night, before her
interview
with Lemuel, Alice saw in the Deity,
only a parent who was calling her home.
Now  on the verge of eternity  she shrank
back, troubled and afraid. The grave which
had been all light, was now all darkness.
You may imagine the emotions which filled
the bosom of Ann Clarke, as she became
conscious
of this truth.
She took the hands of Alice within her
own. She gazed long and fixedly into her
glassy eyes.
Alice! she whispered, Alice! Look up
yonder! It is the Lord who now awaits you
and calls you to your home!
Was there power in the words, or in the
faith of the speaker? It lies beyond us to
answer
;
but the face of the dying woman
brightened with a calm rapture, and she raised
her eyes heavenward, with a look that may
have been only a reflection from the light of a
Better World.
I see! I see! she cried, in a voice of
unutterable gladness, and gently pressed her
hands together.
The next instant she was dead. Her gaze
fixed and glassy. She breathed no more. The
young woman closed her eyes, and smoothed
her golden hair along her marble cheek, all the
while repeating in a low voice these words:
Depart, Christian soul! out of this world,
in the Name of God the Father Almighty who
created thee: in the Name of Jesus Christ,
Son of the living God, who suffered for thee;
in the Name of the Holy Ghost, who sanctified
thee; in the name of the Angels, Archangels,
Thrones, and Dominations, Cherubim, and
Seraphim; in the Name of the Patriarchs and
Prophets, of the Holy Apostles and
Evangelists
,
of the Holy Martyrs and Confessors, of
the Holy Monks and Hermits, of the Holy
Virgins and of all the Saints of God; let thy
place be this day in Peace, and thy abode
in Holy Sion: Through Christ our Lord.
Amen
.
The first sunbeam came. It shone upon the
dead mother and upon her babe, which
slumbered
in the arms of the young woman, who
sate upon the bed.
A glad shout burst upon the air of the death
room. The door opened with a crash, and a
little boy, with cheeks flushed with color, and
golden hair floating on his broad shoulders,
came plunging into the room.
Ma, it's morning! he cried as he sprang
toward the bed.
The Mother is buried: the yellow earth of
her grave, is seen distinctly amid the
churchyard
,
white with snow.
Alone in the mansion of Oakleaf, sits the
young woman with the new-born babe upon
her knee, and the boy by her side. There is
warm light upon the tiny face of the babe,
warm light upon the golden curls of Harry,
warm and rosy light upon the haggard visage
of the young woman, their protectress.
What shall be the Fortune of these children?
Wait, and we will see. After the Mother
has been buried many days, her Uncle  her
nearest and most beloved relative  arrives
from the West, and hastens to Oakleaf. The
death of Arthur is proved: and he sees the
grave of his niece.
This niece Alice Bayne, was worth, in her
own right, something like Ten Thousand
Dollars. Her husband possessed near Fifteen
Thousand Dollars. This property was in stock,
in lands, in houses and in gold.
Did Alice make a will? This question of
course is answered. No. Then, reasons the
Uncle, the property descends to the children,
to Harry the boy, and Annie the new-born
babe. Of course the Uncle is correct. He is
about to take out letters of Administration, as
Executor of the deceased, When
Ah! That is the very point of the matter!
When there came to Oakleaf the Rev. Lemuel
Gardiner (or the Minister whose real
designation
we conceal under this fictitious name) and
with the reverend Convert from Rome, came
Jacob Something Esq., Attorney at Law.
`The dear blessed young lady before her
death, deeply affected with the perilous
condition
of the Heathen World, left all her own
property to the Universal South Sea Island
Missionary Association.'
This was one half of the Rev. Lemuel's
story. It may be as well to state that Lemuel
was the President, actual President if not
nominal, of the U. S. S. I. M. A.
`Then she by her will appointed the Rev.
Lemuel Gardiner and Jacob Something, Esq.,
Executors and Administrators of the estate.
She also appointed these gentlemen guardians
of her children, and trustees of her estate,
until
these children become respectively nineteen
and twenty-one years of age.'
This was the other half of the Rev.
Lemuel's
story.
These events, you will bear in mind,
occured
in the course of the year 1826.
You may fancy the surprise of the Uncle
when he heard the story. As for Ann Clarke,
she said nothing: the eye of Lemuel was upon
her, but she remembered well the prayers
which Lemuel uttered by the couch of the
dying Alice.
The Uncle thought deeply? Should he go
to law? Go to law with the U. S. S. I. M.
A., and fling himself into the face of the
Church over which Lemuel was Pastor? The
will was before him, properly written, signed
by the dead woman, and legally witnessed.
What
could
the Uncle do.
He went out West again, and never saw
Harry or Annie from the hour when he left
Oakleaf until the day of his death.
As for the Rev. Lemuel behold him installed
as the Master at the Oakleaf Mansion. He is
the Guardian of the Children; the Trustee of
the Estate. For Jacob Something, Esq., is
only a blank. And Ann Clark, protectress of
the children, is notified that her presence at
Oakleaf is no longer needed.
A month after the death of Alice, Ann is
coolly dismissed from Oakleaf by the Rev.
Lemuel Gardiner.
Two months afterwards, both children,
Harry
and Annie, are stolen from Oakleaf by some
person or persons unknown.
The Rev. Lemuel fills the papers with
advertisements; he seeks for the children in
every quarter; and after the lapse of a few
more months, disappears suddenly himself.
The papers, speak at length of his mysterious
disappearance, and universal sympathy
prevails
,
which is materially modified, when it is
discovered, that before leaving, the Rev.
Lemuel
had sold lands and houses without number,
and realized some Twenty Thousand Dollars
in gold and silver.
Meanwhile what has become of the children?
And did Dr. Reuben Gatherwood die of the
wounds inflicted by his unknown assailant?
No. He suffered much, but he lived. His
practice grew, his fees multiplied, his fame
was echoed through all the Medical Schools.
But not more than a year after the death of
Alice, he also suddenly disappeared, and like
the Rev. Lemuel Gardiner, was never again
seen nor heard of in Philadelphia.
But the children, and Ann Clarke  what
has become of them? Let us listen to the
poor wretch who is dying in the third story of
Bonus Court. Still clutching the wrist of the
Priest, she whispers the last words of her
Confession  that Confession on which we
have based the Narrative of the preceding
chapters.
CHAPTER SIXTEENTH.
THE DEATH-ROOM IN BONUS COURT.
We are once more in Bonus Court. Again
we behold the face of the Priest, who is held
to the couch of death, by the clutch of the
dying woman's hand.
I could not live apart from the children.
I knew that Lemuel Gardiner had procured
that will by fraud. I stole the children from
Oakleaf, and changed their names. For years
I worked and slaved to give them a support,
and  she paused and gasped for breath
Behold the end of all!
Her eyes wandered about the desolate room,
and the light revealed each repulsive feature of
her pestilence-smitten face.
The Priest, stricken as he was by horror,
mustered sufficient calmness to ask a question:
Have you ever since 1826 heard of
Lemuel
Gardiner?
Once, after his flight, I heard that he still
lived  that he was preaching against the Pope
in a distant part of the country.
Even touched as it was by death, her face
assumed an expression of scornful laughter.
And Reuben Gatherwood  this
treacherous
Physician  have you ever heard of him
since 1826?
Some years ago, it was stated that he was
engaged in the African Slave Trade. The
name under which he passed was Captain
something, Brad  Bradbury, or some such
name.
The Priest's brow became clouded.
And the children?
One a white slave; and the other an
outcast
.
Yes, yes  her voice rose in a
shriek of horrible laughter  One is
hastening
rapidly to the public streets  you hear
me? Her future is that of the woman who
traffics her favors for bread. The other is
hastening as rapidly to the Penitentiary. And
these are the children of Arthur and Alice
Bayne! Don't you think this Reuben will
have a rich account to settle up yonder?
She laughed again: And Lemuel  O, the
Apostate and three-fold Traitor! Would I
could see him now, to tell him what his crimes
will bring him to at last!
The Priest trembled at the horrible
expression
of her countenance. He endeavored to
withdraw his hand, but she only clutched his
wrist with a firmer grasp.
Come, he said, I will absolve you for
all these sins. I must leave you now.
He began to repeat a prayer from the ritual
of the Roman Church. It was the same
prayer which many years before, Ann Clarke
had uttered by the bed of the dying Alice:
Depart, Christian soul! out of this world,
in the Name of God the Father Almighty who
created thee: in the Name of Jesus Christ,
Son of the living God, who suffered for thee:
in the Name of
Death is near, and there is no longer a
mist before my soul, cried the dying woman,
as her eyes flamed with an unnatural light
Do not pray for me Priest  not yet! not
yet! Not until I have told you the fate of
Reuben Gatherwood and Lemuel Gardiner!
Hold! faltered the Priest, you must not
employ your last hour in curses.
The tone of the dying woman became
strangely calm and measured.
I do not curse, she whispered, I only
predict. This Reuben and this Lemuel are
linked together in crime. Reuben a Physician
false to God and man, and steeped to the lips
in pollution. Lemuel an apostate Priest, a
faithless lover, a wretch in holy robes who
guided the hand of Alice, when she signed
away the heritage of her children. Do you
behold those comrades in iniquity? Have you
listened to the history of their crimes? Now
listen, while I describe the manner of their
death.
No! No! shrieked the Priest, struggling
with the hand which clutched his wrist  I
will not hear you. Remember! you are about
to leave this world, with all its trials and its
hatreds. Do not curse.
Up in the wretched bed, started the miserable
woman. She flung her black hair, streaked
with silver, aside from her hideous face.
Then, clutching the Priest with one hand, she
stretched forth the other  blotched by disease
as though pointing toward a scene, which
rose before her glazing eyes:
They shall die together
, she whispered,
Reuben and Lemuel locked in the embrace
of despair, and taunting each other with
their mutual crimes. Do you not see them?
Look! Look! There
Her voice was gone. With that prophecy,
uttered by lips livid and loathsome with the
pestilence, her soul passed away. The Priest
was grasped by a dead hand, whose fingers
encircled his wrist with a clutch of iron.
His harsh features, thrown into relief by his
skull-cap, were distorted by a look of fright
and terror.
Take your hand from my wrist, he cried,
I will not hear your curses! Away! away!
Don't force me to battle with a dying woman.
Bewildered by his fright, he started to his
feet, but the hand still clutched his wrist.
Curses upon my folly! Why did I enter
this den? Why, lured by the hope of hearing
something that might bring me gold, did I
hurry to the death bed of Ann Clarke? with
his freed hand he wiped the cold moisture
from his forehead  Ann, you should not be
revengeful, his voice fell into an accent of
whining entreaty  We are all frail  not
one of us is free from sin. I am not the cause
of the degradation of these children. Indeed I
am not.
His voice grew faint and fainter. He sank
on his knees. His eyes closed, and his head
fell forward, upon the ragged coverlet. His
black skull-cap and dark attire, were distinctly
disclosed by the light fading in its socket, while
gaunt and loathsome, the body of the dead
woman, half uncovered, was stretched upon
that bed of despair.
No one was there to close her lifeless lids.
Her jaw had fallen, and her cold eyes seemed
to glare with a defiant look, upon the Priest,
whose face was buried in the coverlet near her
side.
The light was fading low and lower, the
place was still with the stillness of death, and
the dead woman's hand still clutched the wrist
of the Priest.
Once more we return to the room on the
first floor.
CHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.
RALPH AND STEWEL ONCE MORE.
That
ar
' tin box, said Stewel, puffing his
cigar.
Ralph once more clad in his outcast rags,
confronted him with folded arms, and teeth set
together.
What does thee mean! asked a mild
sweet voice, as Martha Lott advanced from the
shadows. Thou hadst better put thy pistol
and thy club into thy pocket again.
Poor Hannah Marvin said nothing, but her
eyes expanded with a look of vague wonder.
What do I mean? said Stewel, as with
mace and pistol, he seemed to embody all the
plenitude of the Law, in his own corpulent
person: Why it's enough to break a-body's
heart, so it is. Here's this young gallus been
robbin' a most respectable individual of a tin
box filled with valleyable papers. A parfic
burglar Ma'am!
Ralph what has thee to say to this? said
Martha Lott laying her hand gently upon his
shoulder.
Ralph was silent. With knit brows and
compressed lips, he was endeavouring to solve
a singular problem, or rather a series of
problems
.
Had Stewel really taken him for a rich
man's son, whose name was
Charles Augustus
Millikin?
Or, had Stewel, knowing his
residence
in Bonus Court, deliberately planned
the robbery, and aided him in his escape from
Brother Caleb's House? These queries were
passing through the mind of Ralph: he was
bewildered by a torrent of suspicions and
surmises
which buzzed like a nest of bees, in his
brain.
What do you mean? S-a-y? he
exclaimed
,
determined to put a bold face upon the
matter: I know nothin' o' yer tin box. Yer
mistaken in the person  you are.
Stewel, pistol in one hand and mace in the
other, advanced a step, and whispered a few
words, audible only to the outcast boy.
You see young man, I know'd you had
genus, and so I put the management o' this
little affair into your hands. I seed you often
with the Fairy boys, and I ses, ses I, here's
the young man, as can make his fortin by
helpin' the Constitooshun and Laws. You
take? I'm the Constitooshun and Laws; I
am. Well, my chick, when I heer'd these
covies were plannin' the robbery of
Goodleigh's
house, I pitched upon you as the very
chap to settle their hash. I kidnapped you in
front of the Church, made believe that I thought
you was Charles Augustus Milliken, and put
you, in the dark, into Goodleigh's house.
Don't you take yit? Why bless your soul, I
know'd you'd git the tin box all the while
you're
so
enterprizin'! And I know'd you'd
make a straight track for Bonus Court
though I took keer not to tell you so
. And
now my dear, I've killed two birds with one
stone. I've got the robbers safe in the lock-up,
and through you, I've got the tin box. D'ye
see? Jist pitch it over, and say no more
about it.
Ralph heard this candid explanation with a
singular complication of emotions. It was
clear that Stewel himself had planned the
robbery. No less clear, that Stewel himself,
had entangled each one of the burglars, in a
plot to rob Goodleigh's house. And clearest
of all, that he, Ralph Jones, familiarly termed
Jonesey the B'iler, had been made the
scape-goat of Stewel's speculation, and the
dupe of Stewel's pleasant game of
Constitooshun
and Laws.
Will Ralph give up the tin box, and thus put
the cap-stone to Stewel's magnificent scheme?
Let us listen.
Go way from me, growls Ralph squaring
his elbows: You're gass-y man! What do
yer mean, by jawin' about a tin box? Get
out!
Stewel cocked the pistol. Stewel brandished
the mace. Come along, he said mildly,
as he puffed his cigar  We'll quit these
primises together.
Moyamensin's
the word.
With one movement the Quaker woman
and the Millerite's daughter, advanced and
interrupted
the scene, with their respective
exclamations
:
Take care! you will shoot him! cried
Hannah.
Friend, thou art behaving exceedingly bad,
said Martha Lott. Fie! Shame on thee!
to brandish these weapons at the breast of a
defenceless child!
Let him come on, growled Ralph: If
he shoots he'll be hung. An' there 'aint been
a Polees Offisser hung for these fifty years.
Won't it be a sight? Crickey! How he'll
kick!
And Ralph, as if inspired by the picture
drawn by his vivid fancy, burst into a hearty
fit of laughter. At the same time, eyeing
Stewel
from head to foot, he added in a more
quiet tone
It 'll take a thunderin' rope, though!
Why you must weigh six hundred. Was you
ever 'sibited in a cattle show?
Stewel was but human. Even the placid
current of his official temper was ruffled by
the taunts of the ruffian boy. He dashed the
cigar from his mouth.
Now will you come, or won't you come?
he brandished his mace before the eyes of
Ralph.
Thee had better go with him, said the
Quaker Woman. Doubtless he is mistaken.
To-morrow all things can be made right.
The mild voice, the calm face of the Quaker
woman, seemed to subdue the rugged spirit of
the young ruffian. His face changed; he
seemed to hesitate whether to make an attack
upon Stewel, or to submit quietly to his
guidance.
Go, Ralph, whispered Hannah: in the
morning father will get you bail
What if I give up the tin box? said Ralph
suddenly  That is, admittin' for argument
sake, that I've got the tin box?
Stewel's face brightened.
Why then my lad, I'll give you an even
ten dollars, and say no more about it.
An' if I won't give it up?
Then you snooze in Moyamensin' to-night
and come up afore Judge Choktaw at the next
Court
Chocktaw? echoed Martha Lott
Whom does thee call Chocktaw.
Stewel cast upon the questioner a look of
bland condescension and replied:
Chocktaw is an ornament to any Christ'en
community. He does things up brown, I tell
you. If you come before him, he just takes
a squint at your dress, and at a squint he
knows your character, and measures your
punishment
.
He's down on rags, I tell ye. Rags
always get a full dose in the Pennytensherry,
Rags does when Choktaw's on the bench. But
7
broadcloth  Lord! How he loves it, and
smoothes over its weakness, and remembers
what a good family it comes from!
Choktaw's
one of 'em.
I gin in, interrupted Ralph: Come up
stairs. The tin box is yours.
He moved toward the stairway, but Stewel
arrested his step with a levelled pistol.
None of your attempts to escape, he
exclaimed
:
The first move o' that kind you
make, I fire. You know? Go ahead  I'm
at your heels.
Ralph accordingly ascended the stairs,
followed
close by Stewel, with mace and pistol
in his hand.
Well! cried Martha Lott, as they
disappeared
This surprises me! Ralph has
not been up stairs, and therefore I conclude
that the tin box is not there.
And the poor Mother is alone there,
making confession to the Priest, added
Hannah
.
She will not last until to-morrow.
Where does Fanny stay?'
And with evident impatience the twain
awaited the re-appearance of Ralph and Stewel.
CHAPTER EIGHTEENTH.
THE CONVERTED MONK.
As Ralph ascended the stairs, followed by
Stewel, a crowd of opposing thoughts struggled
through his busy brain.
There's a trap door in the ceilin' and I
might get through that ar' door into the loft
and from the loft out upon the roof, and then
good mornin' to ye Mister Stewel Pydgeon!
So Ralph determined to escape from Stewel
by the trap-door, in the ceiling of the third story.
He passed through the room on the second
floor. It was wrapped in darkness.
Where are you feller? cried Stewel and
Ralph heard the click of his pistol: The
fust sign o' foul play, and I shoot
'Nother story higher, answered Ralph:
Come on! Here's the stairs! You shall
have yer tin box, or my name's not Jonesey.
They were ascending the stairway which led
upward into the death room. Ralph's heart
beat wildly under its ragged jacket, as he
saw the light shining through the chinks of the
door. He laid his hand upon the latch.
Wonder how mother is? he said, and
opened the door.
Stewel followed him into the room, closed
the door, and calmly surveyed the various
details
of the scene.
The Corpse resting upon the ragged bed,
with a red gleam of light playing upon its
disfigured features. The dark figure kneeling
beside the bed, with one hand grasped by the
hand of the dead. The light flickering in its
socket, now shooting up in a vivid flash, and
suddenly dying away, until the blank walls and
the miserable bed, were wrapped in vague
twilight
.
Stewel beheld the scene, and uttered, in his
surprise a blasphemous oath. His hands sank
by his side; both mace and pistol were pointed
to the floor.
As for Ralph he did not seem to heed the
kneeling figure, nor remark the tattered
coverlet
,
which gave such a look of utter misery to
that scene of death.
The first sight, the only sight that enchained
his gaze, was the face of the dead woman, the
cold eyes fixed upon the ceiling and the black
hair, streaked with silver, floating over her
clammy forehead.
Ralph passed his hands through his hair.
He picked the buttons of his ragged coat.
And standing by the bed with large, lack-lustre
eyes, he continued to thread his matted hair,
and pull the buttons of his coat, while Stewel
remained like one spell-bound at his side.
I guess the old woman's dead. Don't you
think she's dead? he whispered, turning to
Stewel, with a strange grimace on his face.
Kicked the bucket  eh?
And then he laughed. Such a laugh! Low,
and growling through his set teeth, it even made
Stewel start aside, as though something
unpleasant
had stricken him in the face.
What a cuss! muttered Stewel  aint
got no nateral feelin's.
Ralph, who in good sooth, felt in every nerve
that Death was in the room, but who did not
know how to control or to express his feelings,
seated himself quietly upon the bed, and laid
his hand upon the head of the corpse.
So you're gone, old woman, he muttered,
with an idiotic grin upon his face: Left us
for good  hey? No more hard work, and
slavin' and starvin' where you're gone to?
Thus saying Ralph pulled his matted hair
over his eyes, and Stewel by the uncertain
light, saw a large tear glitter down the cheek
of the ruffian boy.
Stewel began to feel exceedingly
uncomfortable
.
He felt that the dignity of the
Magistracy
was in danger.
Come, hand us over the tin box, and we'll
say no more about it, he said, with some
effort, for there was a thick and choking
sensation
in his throat.
Go round 'tother side o' th' bed, answered
Ralph  Feel under the pillow.
Stewel without a word, passed the figure of
the kneeling Priest, and in a second stood
between
the bed and the wall.
What's the matter with that Preacher?
he exclaimed, pointing to the unconscious man
Where did you say? Under the pillow?
Y-a-a-s, muttered Ralph.
Stewel laid both mace and pistol upon the
bed, while his eyes began to tremble with an
expression of serene complacency. Stewel
muttered, the tin box is here  is it? and
placed one hand beneath the pillow, bending
very low in the action.
Ralph silently tore the hand from the wrist
of the Priest, and lifted the body of the dead
woman in his arms. When Stewel looked up
he was confronted by that half-covered form;
that face, stricken by pestilence in its most
loathsome phase, was right before his eyes.
The fixed eyeballs were glaring upon him; the
naked arms dangling by the side of the corpse,
only half concealed by the streaming hair,
touched his hands.
At this moment the light died away and
flashed up wildly, giving the raised corpse, a
look which bore a ghastly resemblance to life.
There! Take yer tin box! shouted
Ralph, and pushed the corpse against the
breast of the Police officer. At the same
intant
he seized the mace and pistol, and started
to the door.
Follow me, and you'll git jesse! cried
Ralph as he opened the door, levelling the
pistol
at the face of Stewel.
How do you like it, old hoss? Come and
ask for a tin box when there's a dead woman
about?
Stewel shrank back horror-stricken from the
cold touch of the corpse, and in his effort to
release himself from that loathsome contact,
he missed his footing and fell to the floor. The
body of the dead woman, fell heavily upon
him, its face close to his own, its hair
streaming
over his shoulders.
Good bye, old boy! he heard the voice
of Ralph, and then felt the jar of the closing
door.
You may imagine that it was some time,
ere the Police officer could recover sufficient
presence of mind, to extricate himself from his
unpleasant situation. Shuddering, in every
fibre of his corpulent frame, he raised the
corpse, and placed it once more upon the
couch. Stewel's face was no longer red:
every vestige of color had fled from his round
fat cheeks.
He uttered an oath, and came round the bed,
with unsteady steps, passing his hand over his
eyes, as though he was the victim of some
horrible dream.
Why cuss the thing, the boy is gone! he
ejaculated at last: Where's the pistols?
Hello? I'm sold  reglar'ly sold. Fire!
murder
!
Stop thief!
He was hurrying to the door, when his
footsteps
were arrested by the Priest, who aroused
from his swoon by the action of Ralph, now
stood silent and pale, in the centre of the room,
his arms folded over his narrow chest. He
lifted his eyes to the face of Stewel, without
raising his downcast head.
You here? Lemuel Gardiner! That is to
say, Father John,
alias
Converted Priest,
alias
Monk of Blarney! Why I thought you was
a firin' at the Pope  aint this your lectur'
night?
Stewel stopped suddenly, and surveyed the
man of a dozen aliases from head to foot. In
this slender personage, with that coarsely
featured
face, surmounted by a black skull cap,
Stewel recognized an old friend, whose real
name long lost to the mass of Philadelphians,
was vividly remembered by the Police Officer.
Lemuel Gardiner  whose name was
uttered
with curses by the dying woman  has
returned to the Quaker City, after many years
absence, and in a new character. Once known
as a Converted Priest, then as a fugitive for
Justice  behold him now, in the character of
a Converted Monk. For Lemuel has taken
the No-Popery people by the inmost heart, and
Lemuel delivers lectures against the Pope, to
audiences composed of boys and girls, at a
quarter of a dollar per head. Sweet lectures,
too, composed of all that is foul in thought or
language, and refreshingly spiced with a
fervent
hate of Rome, and all that appertains to
the very name of Rome.
And now, Lemuel Gardiner, otherwise
called Father John, and more frequently the
Converted Monk, regarded Stewel with a
cautious
and searching look. His small eyes
sunk deeper in their sockets, and his lips,
remarkable
for their gross expression, were
agitated
by a violent grimace.
Stewel, he whispered, We knew one
another in other times  many years ago.
We did hoss, was the quick response of
the Police officer.
You know me well, and I know you. To
come to the question at once, did you ever
hear of the Ship Falcon?
His face was animated by a look of sudden
malignity; his voice grew hard and strident.
The Ship Falcon? responded Stewel,
Why bless you `Monk,' that's the slave ship,
as has been seized by the 'Nited States
authorities
.
She was brought in from the coast
o' Brazil by an American Frigate. She's
now layin' safe and snug, over yonder, in the
bay o' New York.
Very well, continued Lemuel, Did you
ever hear of
Captain Bradburne?
Stewel could not restrain an ejaculation,
which was more remarkable for its nervous
force then for its elegance or polish:
Burn my time! Of course I have!
Don't you think I read the papers?
Wonder
if he overheerd my talk with Ralph? Does
he know anythin' about the tin box!
The
italicised words were uttered to himself, in a
tone which was unintelligible to the `Converted
Monk.'
Captain Bradburne was the commander
of the Slave vessel, quietly remarked
Lemuel
.
He escaped, just afore his ship was taken
off Brazil, interrupted Stewel.
The authorities have been in pursuit of
him, for at least three months. They are
very anxious to secure him, as he made
himself
notorious as the Captain of a Slave
Ship
Not mentionin' the half a million he's
made by that very rispectable business, again
interrupted Stewel.
Lemuel, without heeding this interruption,
continued in a lower voice  He has been
heard of, since the seizure, in various parts of
the Union. Under various names too, and in
all kinds of disguises. Come, Stewel, what
do you think his capture would be worth?
He placed his hand abruptly upon Stewel's
shoulder, as his small eyes, buried in their
sockets, shone with a sudden and sinister
lustre
.
Worth? echoed Stewel, with a vacant
stare,
Does
he know anythin' o' th' tin
box? he added to himself.
Why you know Stewel, that his capture
will be worth at least ten thousand dollars to
his captors. Suppose him once taken, and
the proofs of his guilt brought clearly home to
him?
He'd give ten thousand to get off  hey?
Or, the Government would give ten
thousand
,
for proof, which would convict him.
Do you understand Stewel?
Stewel as if impressed by a new thought
uttered an ejaculation, and struck his forehead
violently with his clenched hand:
Stoo
pid! Captain Bradburne of the
Falcon
!
he said in a low voice  Did not I
hear that name to-night somewhere? Where?
Was it at Goodleigh's house?
Goodleigh? cried Lemuel, I think you
uttered that name?
Caleb Goodleigh, the man what owns a
mint or two of the dimes, answered Stewel,
He lives in  street and
Caleb Goodleigh and Captain Bradburne
are the same person, Lemuel's voice sank,
while his eyes lifted up with a sudden lustre:
Do you understand me, now?
Ho, ho! Now I know what the tin box
contained. Valleyable papers; indeed! I
rather guess so. Why Lem, my dear, this
Captain Bradburne 'ud give thirty thousand,
yes fifty thousand to get off!
One word in these somewhat incoherent
remarks
of the Police Officer arrested the
attention
of the `Converted Monk:'
The tin box? What do you know of the
tin box?
It was stolen to-night from Goodleigh's
house. As we're chums now, I'll tell you the
whole story. The boy what jist escaped stole
it  I was arter him, when you started up
afore me. That box, that identical box,
contained
the proofs of Goodleigh's connection
with the Slave trade? Hey? Come  there's
no time to be lost. Let's make tracks arter
him
Hush! said the `Converted Monk,' raising
his right hand with a gesture of caution: The
tin box contained valuable papers, but the most
valuable are concealed in Goodleigh's house, in
Street. Do you want to arrest him
tonight
?
Come with me. I have a key to his
front door. You can secure him in his bed,
while I search the Iron Room, where these
papers are concealed.
He moved a step toward the door, but
Stewel grasped him by the arm:
Wait a minnit, he whispered, regarding
the sinister face of the Monk with a
suspicious
glance: You don't mean any foul
play? If you do  he paused and muttered
in a vague manner  The Iron Room! I
think you mentioned a place o' that name.
Where is it?
Come with me, was the answer of
Lemuel
.
Once in Goodleigh's house, we can
quietly arrange the plan of this important affair.
Come
Had not we better sarch for the tin box
afore we leave? suggested Stewel: It's
somewheres in this room
Pooh, pooh! When we obtain the papers
in the Iron Room, we will not need either the
tin box or its valuable papers. Come  in an
hour Goodleigh can be arrested and the proofs
of his guilt secured.
We go sheers, don't we? suggested Stewel,
closing one eye.
That rests with you. Money is not my
object. I have an old account to settle with
Captain Bradburne. That is all. When he
is arrested, you may do what you please with
the reward
But suppose he makes an attempt to buy
off? You said something about that?
`Did I? the face of Lemuel was agitated
by an expression of doubt and wonder; That
must not, cannot be! He placed his hand
upon his forehead  You must not think of
anything of this kind, Stewel. The money,
which I will place in your hands, at
Goodleigh's
house, money which you can pocket
without danger, will far exceed any bribe that
he can offer you. But we lose time. Let us
be going.
He took his broad rimmed hat from the
table, and as he turned to the door, his face was
reddened by a sudden gleam of the waning
light. Every feature was convulsed by
emotion
.
The Corpse also warmed by the sudden
flash, into a hideous mockery of life, lay stiff
and gaunt before him.
Ann Clark! he muttered, When I first
saw you, in the home where you supported
your aged mother, by the slavery of the needle,
I little thought that we would ever part, to
meet at last, in a scene like this!
None o' your nonsense `monk'  move
on, exclaimed Stewel. By the bye hoss, jist
explain the mystery o' that Iron Room as we
go along.
CHAPTER NINTEENTH.
JOHN CATTERMILL.
They left the room together, as the light
flared up for the last time. And as he closed
the door, Lemuel Gardiner, looked over his
shoulder  looked once and for a moment, but
with a shudder  at the bed, whereon was
stretched the lifeless and distorted form of Ann,
the friend of Alice Bayne.
Then the door closed, and they descended
the stairs, in one darkness. At every step
Lemuel
whispered the name of Goodleigh, and
gave Stewel a hurried description of the Iron
Room in Goodleigh's House.
Presently they reached the first floor. The
Quaker woman and the Millerite's Daughter
were waiting there, but a third person had
entered
upon the scene.
It was the wife of John Cattermill, who
with haggard face and dishevelled hair, poured
forth a broken train of ejaculations, as she
pressed her babe against her breast.
O, John, John, how could he go to do it!
Jist think of it Ma'am! To turn a thief at
his years! I think I shall go crazy.
What
does
thee mean? asked Martha
Lott, who gazed upon that troubled face with
a look of deep compassion: Thee has been
out in the cold, with but scanty covering. Be
calm  and tell me the cause of all this
suffering
Yes, Nancy, tell her the story, and she
will do her best to relieve you, interrupted a
mild voice, and the face of Hannah Marvin,
confronted the weeping woman: What has
become of your husband? He left the house,
an hour ago  did he not!
At this moment, the form of Stewel, emerged
from the stairway door, the visage of Lemuel,
scowling from the shadows, behind his broad
shoulders.
Lay low, `Monk!' whispered the Police
Officer: Lay low, and hear something rich.
And standing in the doorway of the
staircase
,
these respectable worthies, listened to the
story of Nancy Cattermill:
Why you see Ma'am, a couple of hours
ago, when John had got over his fit o'
delerious
tremens, and was sittin' by the fire, talkin'
of Isr'el Bonus, there comes in, a fat man with
with a green patch over his eye, and a red face,
a very red face  that is as much of it as
could be seen.
That's me, whispered Stewel to his
companion
Don't she take a pictur' with a rale
daguerreotype touch?
An' this fat man begins to talk with John,
and to tell him, what a shame it was that he
was so poor. An' then they talked in
whispers
I couldn't hear much  but I see'd
John's eyes light up, and after a long while
heard him say  `I'm your man. For
anything
I'm your man.' An' then Ma'am they
goes out together, John and the fat man with
a green patch over one eye. I asks John
where he was goin', but he pushed me away,
and  O! Is'nt it too bad? Don't you
think it is?
She burst into a violent fit of sobbing.
Don't know she's a detainin' the audience,
whispered Stewel, still waiting in the stairway
door: I'd like to know what became o' John
arter this.
Martha Lott and Hannah Marvin in vain
endeavored to assuage the grief of the wretched
woman. Gathering her babe in the tattered
shawl, she sank into the only chair  turning
her face toward the light, she continued:
An' I waited for John and waited, and
waited, O! ever so long, but John did not
come back. At last, a while ago, I went out
o' the court, and went down the street, and
stood at the next corner. It was bitter cold,
but I tried to keep my baby warm as well as
I could, an' you don't know how bad I felt, as
I stood there all alone, thinkin' o' things as
they are now, an' o' things as they were last
year. O! sich a change!
A lick of pathos! whispered Stewel.
Well, thee waited? said Martha Lott.
Waited there, Ma'am, at the corner of the
street, with my baby in my arms, and at last I
hear'd a step, and know'd it was John's, and
I saw him comin' across the street. `John,
where have you been?' says I, springin'
toward him, when  she dropped her babe
upon her lap, and wrung her hands  when
two strange men, who had follered John across
the street, jumped upon him, and tied him,
and took him off in a wagon. They did
and what's worse than all, they said he was a
thief  yes, that he'd been robbin' a house in
street. I think they told me the name
of the man who owned the house
Goodleigh
,
I think it was. And they took him off,
and he's in Moyamensin' this blessed night.
Don't you think it's hard, Ma'am?
Before Martha could reply, the police officer
stepped from the doorway, and followed by
the converted Monk, approached the light with
a measured stride. Stewel's hands were in
his pockets, and Stewel's cap was drawn over
his eyes, but beneath the leathern frontlet of
that cap, his cheeks appeared in all the
plenitude
of bulk and color.
Folks, I jist thought I'd mention to you,
that the lady up stairs has gone out o' this
su
bul
nary vale o' tears, said Stewel, In
other words, she's dead. Did you see
anythin'
o' that scapegrace boy, Ma'am? he
added, turning to Martha Lott.
At the sound of his voice, Nancy Cattermill
raised her face, and looked about her with a
vague stare.
Did you hear
that?
she exclaimed,
taking Martha Lott by the hand. That
voice, I mean. It's his voice. The fat man,
with the green patch over his eye, who came
here, and turned my husband into a thief.
She raised her eyes, and beheld the
benevolent
face of Stewel Pydgeon.
It's him  I know'd it! cried Nancy,
starting from the chair, with her babe in her
arms: Now, Mister, jist tell us  what
did you do with my husband?
This is a serious charge, friend, said
Martha Lott  Especially serious when we
reflect, that thou art a police officer.
Stewel smiled blandly, smiled throughout
his lips and cheeks, even to his eyes, half
hidden in bulging lids.
Lord bless you, Ma'am, he waved his
hand with a gesture of great dignity: It's a
way they all have. Every one o' these creturs
asks me for her husband. Just as if I carried
a pocket-full o' husbands, wherever I go.
You are a villian! shrieked Nancy,
clenching her hand: Worse than Isr'el
Bonus  that you are
Da-da-a, folks! smiled Stewel, as he
moved to the door. Come along my
Reverend
friend. This society, no doubt, don't agree
with your moral wholesome.
He took the arm of the Converted Monk,
and hurried him through the front door.
I will see about this, to-morrow,
whispered
the Quaker woman, as she laid her hand
upon Nancy's shoulder: Thou shalt have
justice. Thy husband shall be cared for.
To-morrow, my friend.
Nancy heard the low musical voice. She
raised her eyes, and caught the impassioned
benevolence
of the Quaker woman's countenance.
God bless you! cried Nancy with a burst
of tears. If there was more Quakers like
you, there would not be many sich places as
Bonus Court.
A few whispered words passed between
Martha Lott and the Carpenter's wife, and then
the Quaker woman took Hannah by the hand,
and led her silently up the stairs, into the
third story.
Nancy remained by the decaying fire,
hushing
her babe as it moaned in its slumber, and
fixing her vacant gaze upon the walls of her
desolate home.
Meanwhile in the third story, the Quaker
woman, aided by the Millerite's daughter,
performed
the last sad offices for the dead.
Together
they straightened those cramped limbs.
They were not afraid of contagion even in its
most hideous shape. They smoothed the hair
aside from the brow, and closed the eyes, and
arranged the body of Ann Clarke, in an
attitude
of calm repose.
It was not without its meaning  that sight
which the lamp revealed, as the last hours of
the night were fading into day.
The daughter of the Millerite, kneeling
beside
the bed, her hands joined, her eyes
uplifted
in voiceless prayer. The Quaker
woman
,
gazing upon the face of the dead, her
eyes moistened with tears.
O, if men and women, would only leave
creeds and forms alone, and attend with all
their souls, to those simple words of the
Saviour, `Love thy neighbor as thyself.'
This was the muttered ejaculation of the
Infidel Quakeress, who derided by all the
synagogues of the Orthodox, found peace and
religion, in visiting the homes of the desolate
the haunts of the poorest of the poor.
Hannah Marvin the daughter of the despised
Millerite, said nothing for a long while, but as
she remembered the good deeds of the Quaker
woman  as she saw that noble face, lighted
up by the warmth of a divine humanity  she
could not repress an ejaculation, which
bubbled
from her heart to her lips:
I, also, am an Infidel, she said, That is.
I had much rather possess your Infidelity, than
the Christianity of many Churches.
Martha Lott you will remember, was a
Rich Woman. That a Rich Woman should
have the heart to feel for the poor, a hand to
relieve their manifold miseries, a courage to
enter the veriest dens of their wretchedness
all this excited much wonder, in the mind of
the Millerite's Daughter.
But we must leave the place of death and
follow the other persons of our history.
The poor woman lies stiff and cold in
Bonus
Court. Where are the children, whom
she has loved with all a mother's love, for
seventeen
years?
CHAPTER TWENTIETH.
FI-ER!
Ralph in the streets once more!
Barefoot, cold and hungry, he was skulking
in a narrow alley, which, gloomy at all times,
was now dark as midnight. Far overhead
some gleams of moonlight fell upon the icicles
along the roofs, but around the wandering
outcast
all was dark, silent and dreary. He
pulled his cap over his matted hair, folded his
arms upon his tattered jacket, stood for a
moment
upon one foot, and then upon the other,
but still could not banish the cold, which sent
a chill through his tired limbs.
I should like to know where I'm to sleep
to-night  I would. If I go home, Stewel 'ill
ketch me. If I don't I'll freeze to death. It's
a toss-up between Potter's Field and
Moyamensin'
.
Ralph gazed up and down the narrow
court; the shutters were closed, and not a
gleam of light, from an upper window, broke
the gloom of that desolate haunt.
Where's Fan? I should like to see Fan.
Jimminey! Won't she start, when I tell her
to-morrow, how rich I am, and what a fortin'
I'm heir to! Cuss me, but I wish I had some
o' them bright pieces in my pocket jist now!
On'y to think of a man o' fortin' like me, not
havin' a crust to eat, nor so much as a
cellar-door
to sleep on!
Running up and down the snow-covered
pavement, Ralph endeavored to restore some
warmth to his chilled limbs, but in vain.
Stopping at last, in very despair, he sank upon
a wooden step, muttering as he clenched his
hands, this remarkable ejaculation:
I wish the Old State House bell 'ud ring
I do. If there was only the least touch of
a fire, the Fairy 'ud come out, and a feller 'ud
have a chance to warm hisself. But there
ain't no sich luck for me. There's lots o'
Carpenter shops a achein' to be burnt and
nobody to burn 'em.
In the height of his chagrin, he dashed his
cap upon the pavement, at the same time
uttering
an oath which it is not necessary to repeat.
Wonder if day is ever a-goin' to come?
There's a fine pair o' feet to be froze  ain't
they? I rather expect, they'll find me in the
mornin' layin' along the pavement, froze all
over, into a perfec' chunk of ice. Then it 'ill
be put into the papers  `'
Nother young
vaggrant
froze hisself out o' spite
.' Won't it?
For a moment, reader, surround yourself
with the darkness and the cold of this narrow
alley, which diverges from the broad street,
like a by-path from a highway leading through
a lonely forest. Picture the outcast, crouching
on the wooden step, his naked feet upon the
pavement, his cheeks supported by his bony
hands. Then call to mind this solitary fact:
But for the crimes of Reuben Gatherwood and
Lemuel Gardiner  Doctor and Priest  this
savage of city life, would have been surrounded
with the light of education and religion.
Something like the echo of an approaching
footstep struck his ear. Ralph started up, and
listened intently, while his heart beat violently
against his ragged jacket.
Is it a watchman? It can't be Stewel
hello! There she goes! Ding  dong
boom! The old State House forever! Now
for the Fairy!
These wild ejaculations, were produced by
a very simple circumstance.
Deep and echoing, the sound of the State
House bell, rolled over the silent city.
F-i-e-r! F-i-e-r! F-i-e-r! shouted Ralph
at the top of his lungs, as he ran along the
alley toward the neighboring street. Give
way there boys! Let her drive! Wake her
up, Fairy  wake up I s-a-y!
Before the third sound of the bell reaches
our ears, Ralph is gone.
Poor fellow! Little does he dream, what
singular events  events connected with his
own history  are now being heralded in every
tone of the State House bell!
CHAPTER TWENTY FIRST.
BROTHER CALEB'S DREAM.
It is near daybreak, and the moon is shining
brightly upon the broad front of Brother
Caleb's
House.
The carriage no longer waits in the shadows
on the opposite side of the street. What has
become of Lester's hardy friend, who at
midnight
was watching there, anxious to do the
bidding of Ellen's Brother? We cannot tell.
All is silent and deserted along the broad street.
Brother Caleb's House, with its shutters fast
closed, from the first story to the roof, glows
in the moonlight, but is silent as the grave.
Not a ray streams from a window, to tell us
that this mansion is tenanted by a waking
soul.
What deeds are those, which at the moment
are enacting within the walls of Caleb
Goodleigh's
mansion?
We will enter the door, step quietly along
the broad entry, ascend the stairs, and pass
into Brother Caleb's room on the second floor.
A lamp, which stands upon a small
mahogany
table, sheds its dim light over the curtains
of Brother Caleb's bed. Very luxurious
curtains
,
rich crimson in colour, velvet in texture,
and spotted with small flowers and bees,
embroidered
in gold. The light falls upon one
side of the bed, but all the rest of the chamber
you may picture its elegant furniture for
yourselves  is enveloped in vague twilight.
The curtains are parted, and the light shines
on Brother Caleb's face. His lean form wrapped
in a blue satin dressing gown, he rests upon
the coverlet, and turns him in his sleep, as
though he was the victim of some troubled
dream.
His face  whose bronzed hues and bold
features are strongly defined against the soft
satin of the pillow which supports his head
is turned to the light, and you discover that
Brother Caleb is sleeping with his eyes wide
open and teeth set firmly together. Brother
Caleb's face, with sunken cheeks, wide mouth
and thin lips, forehead widening over the brows,
and eyes bulging from their lids, does not
present
a pleasant picture at any time, but now,
agitated by the terrors of a dream, and mocked
by the very contrast of the silken pillow and
velvet curtain, it is as hideous as the phantom
of a nightmare.
And yet he is sleeping there, the owner of
the splendid mansion, like an unsightly kernel,
within a rich, luxurious shell. He is so very,
very rich. A bachelor, too, with no care of
wife or child upon his soul. For him, a
thousand
,
and ten thousand slaves, are waiting ever
not slaves with black faces, and owned by
the life-time merely  but slaves of all hues
and races, whose services he may purchase
with his pieces of gold, and his slips of bank
note paper.
There is something grand in the idea. Here
sleeps a Rich Man who has no care, save that
involved in the legal enjoyment of his appetites.
His money  how gained, where acquired, is
not your business  his money, is but the
embodied toil of some ten thousand slaves;
the work of ten thousand common people,
petrified into bank notes and brick walls.
This money would make ten thousand poor
men happy. This money would give educa
tion to twenty thousand poor men's children.
This money, properly applied, would deprive
the penitentiary and the gallows of many a
victim, and very likely turn every victim into
an honest man.
But away with thoughts like these. Who
talks of depriving Brother Caleb of his
PROPERTY? Property, however won, is
defended
by Law, and sanctified by Religion.
Whatever robbery Property may choose to
commit, it is your part to remain silent. But
let any ragged wretch, pilfer only one of
Property's bank notes, and you shall see,
forthwith, that Property is soundly backed by
Judge and Penitentiary.
One day I saw a crowd of meanly dressed
women, holding children by their hands, go
sadly up the marble steps of a Bank. That
bank had failed, and these women and children
were by its failure, deprived of the very means
of life. There was no law for the woman and
the child; there was no Judge, bold enough to
try these robbers of the Bank.
Another day, I heard, that some thief  or
band of thieves  had stolen seventy thousand
dollars, from the President of a bank. At
once the whole community was in uproar. The
press rung out, the terrible theft, from Maine to
the Rio Grande. Judges and juries were
ready to try the thieves, and Courts sat week
after week, in patient investigation, of the
enormous crime. Fifty thousand dollars of
the people's money, were spent in recovering
seventy thousand dollars, which had been
stolen
from the Bank.
Do you wonder that I compared these two
cases?
In the first case, a bank had robbed a crowd of
women and children of at least one hundred
thousand
dollars. Other banks, by scores and
hundreds
,
had committed similar robberies.
Robberies
,
not of money merely, but of the very
means of subsistence, robberies of life itself.
And in these cases there was neither Judge, Jury,
nor investigation of any kind.
But in the second instance, a Bank had been
robbed  robbed of only seventy thousand
dollars  and then Judges and Courts awoke,
and Juries hungry to be just, sat up day and
night, until the Bank, once more received the
Stolen Dollars.
You need not wonder at the contrast
between
8
these cases. The explanation is as clear
as a sunbeam. In one case
Property
was
robbed; in the other, it was only
Labor
.
The laws, the courts, the judges, belong to
Property. What Labor has on its side, is not
often named: it is amply provided, however,
with Factory, Almshouse, and Penitentiary.
And Brother Caleb was a Rich Man. Is
there no music in that name? Rich Man!
Rich because others have toiled by night and
day, in hot and cold. Rich at all hazards, and
in spite of every tie that binds the human
heart to God; rich, upon the harvest of the
common laborer's suffering; rich, with the
price of blood! This may be. Yet he is
Rich. That is enough. What a pity it is,
for Brother Caleb, that his path covered with
gold, must end at last at the same point which
terminates the poor man's way, which is only
paved with flints and thorns  end at last, at a
narrow pit, seven feet long, by eight feet
deep!
Why is not Brother Caleb immortal? Why
must your Rich Men come down to dust and
grave worms at last, just like your ragged
common
people? This question troubles me
oftentime. Why does the New Testament
speak so terribly of Rich Men? Why does it
pronounce the awful sentence of divine wrath
upon the usurer, the money changer, and
the Rich Man, in all his varied shapes?
This also causes me much anxiety. Could
we not have a Rich Man's edition of the New
Testament, with all improper expressions
carefully
expurgated? Think of it. A Money
Changer's Gospel, warranted not to offend any
Rich Man in the world, or any Rich
Corporation
,
from the last broken Bank, up to Trinity
Church. It is a fine idea; ponder upon it,
Preachers and Vestrymen of the Rich Churches.
While these thoughts pass over me, I am
often forced, against my will, to frame a
thought like this:
Suppose every poor man in the world, could
be removed to some other state of being only
for a month, leaving the globe to the care of
your Men of Money
. What a scene would
ensue  just picture it for a moment! Rich
Men dining on gold, wearing bank notes, and
sleeping upon parchment title deeds  it would
be very singular. Trinity Church would find
a hard time of it, then. How would it pay its
Preachers, and feed its Vestrymen? Could
they eat brick walls, and drink ground rents?
So, we must be forced to the conclusion:
All the comfort, wealth and luxury in the
world, is produced by the sinew of labor
labor that is oftentime without a crust to eat
or a couch for its repose
.
And some day perchance  a thousand years
hence it may be  this ragged and hungry
Labor, may open its eyes and say to Property,
certain words, which I dare not write, but
which you can easily imagine.
But while we are preaching upon the sacred
rights of Property; our friend, Brother Caleb,
tosses uneasily upon his silken pillow, and
turns his writhing features, from side to side.
Rich, very rich, he is still afflicted by a
hideous
dream. This dream divides itself into
four scenes, which sometimes appear to his
soul as separate pictures, and then melt
confusedly
into each other, like the colors of a
kaleidescope.
First, Brother Caleb beholds a brave ship
resting upon the waters of a waveless sea,
under a burning sky. The sky is without a
cloud, the ship is distinctly mirrored in the
glassy surface of the becalmed ocean, and the
sun, from the very centre of the heavens, pours
down a flood of intense, yes, intolerable heat.
My good ship Falcon! muttered Brother
Caleb in his dream. If we land the cargo
at Cuba, we will clear two hundred thousand
dollars.
Then from the lower decks, yes from the
nooks, and caverns of this gallant Ship, the
cargo comes crawling into light. For it is
a living cargo. It breathes, eats and drinks,
and may be sold, for actual dollars. It is
composed
of three hundred men and women and
children, who now throng the deck, and gaze
with fevered eyes, upon the fiery sky.
But lo! a boat, propelled by oars, and
bearing
armed men, with the Flag of the Union
at the helm, appears on the horizon, within
sight of the telescope, and skims silently
over the waters. It is many a mile away, but
Brother Caleb sees it with his telescope and
knows it well.
The boat of that cursed frigate, which has
pursued me for days, and which I would have
escaped but for this calm. Thus he murmurs
in his dream.
The boat comes nearer  what shall Brother
Caleb do? Make resistance? The idea is
vain, for two-thirds of his men are sick with
a plague, engendered by the foul atmosphere
of the Slave Ship. Shall Brother Caleb be
taken, on board of his good ship Falcon, and
arrested as a Slaver, a sort of mercantile
Pirate, whose Capital is flesh and blood?
Look with your own eyes, and see how
Brother Caleb relieves himself from his peril.
The negroes are sent below, and then
brought forth again, one by one. To the plank
with him, to the plank with her, to the plank
with every one! Weights of iron and lead are
tied to each negro's limbs, and a walk along a
plank, followed by a sudden plunge into the
still ocean, removes the cargo, from the sight of
day. Thus Brother Caleb rids himself of his
cargo  men, women, children, all, are quietly
put out of sight, under that fervid sky, and
beneath
the gloomy surface of that waveless sea.
Ho, ho, now let them come, laughed
Brother Caleb in his dream. Overboard with
handcuffs and manacles  overboard with
every thing that may even hint the character
of our late cargo. Up with the Star-Spangled
Banner, and then we'll see who dares to call
our good Falcon by the name of
Slaver
.
This was the first part of Brother Caleb's
dream. The light beside the bed shone full
upon his cold blue eyes, as his soul became
absorbed in the details of a new scene.
Come, Lemuel, we are in Paris, and we
will have a quiet game of
rouge et noir
. This
way  up the stairs, my boy  we are in
Frascati's saloon. Stake your money, on the
red, on the red, my good fellow.
And in his dream, he saw his friend Lemuel
Gardiner stake his money on the red, until
twenty thousand dollars  the heritage of
Annie and Harry Bayne  had passed from
Lemuel's hands.
Poor Lem! mutters Brother Caleb
So unsuspecting! Little does he dream that
ten of the twenty thousand passed into my
hands.
In his sleep his chest heaved violently, and
he made an effort to raise his hands to his
face, but they remained cramped and stiffened
by his side.
Then came the third part of his dream.
A beautiful woman with golden hair and
eyes of summer blue. Alone in a darkened
chamber, she awaits the coming of Dr.
Gatherwood
.
Alice Bayne! mutters brother Caleb,
and then pursues this scene to its sequel.
It must have been a fearful sequel, for as he
dream it over, Brother Caleb's forehead was
wet with beaded moisture.
The last scene of the dream.
Brother Caleb stood at the foot of a
stairway
,
which led upward  far, far upward,
into the clouds. It seemed to him, that he was
forced to ascend this stairway, whose every
step of cold white alabaster, quivered to and
fro, like the folds of a curtain. He shrank
shuddering from the first step, but an invisible
influence urged him onward. In his dream he
began to ascend.
And as in his dream, he touched the first
step of the stairway, he arose from the bed,
and clad in the loose dressing gown, took the
light from the table.
He moves to the door of his chamber, while
his eyes are cold and death-like, imagining that
at every step across the velvet carpet, he is
gaining another step upon the stairway of his
dream.
He passes into the entry, still asleep,
although
his limbs possess the power of motion.
He begins slowly to ascend that wide stairway
of his own mansion, up which he passed with
Charles Lester, an hour ago. And while his
body ascends the real stairway, his soul is
absorbed with the endless stairway, which
leads upward, into infinite space.
Is it not a strange spectacle? Light in hand,
the dressing gown flowing loosely around his
gaunt frame, he passes upward, with a
noiseless
step, at the same time, gazing straight
forward with his fixed eyeballs.
Following the windings of the stairway, he
reaches the third floor, and his light streams in
uncertain gleams, upon the entry below.
Two figures steal from the shadows  they
approach the stairway and look upward toward
the light. You recognize the rubicund face of
Stewel Pydgeon, and the spare form and harsh
features of Lemuel Gardiner, the Converted
Monk.
While the lamp sheds a dim light from the
third floor, listen to the hurried conversation
of those men:
`Who is it Lem? Kin you see his face?
asks Stewel.
Yes  yes  it's Goodleigh, whispered
Lemuel, grasping the bannister of the staircaso.
Awake too, and at this hour!
Then our cake is all dough, again said
Stewel.
Lemuel presses his hand to his forehead,
and at that moment the light passes away.
I have not gained entrance into this house,
at this hour, for nothing, says Lemuel with
an oath: Wait here, Stewel. I will go up
stairs, and meet him face to face. When I
call, you come  will you?
Yes, my dear, responded Stewel.
Wait, whispers the Converted Monk and
with that word he stealthily ascends the stairs.
As he reaches the top, a sudden light flashes
upon his face. He beholds the form of Brother
Caleb, as he stands before the door of an
apartment
,
on the third floor.
He goes to the Iron Room, the thought
half escapes Lemuel's lips, and at the very
moment Brother Caleb disappears.
Cautiously along the entry, steals Lemuel
Gardiner. He listens for a moment at the
door  all is still  but the light from within
streams once more into his face.
I will enter, and meet him face to face,
he mutters, and pushing open the door, enters
the apartment. It is the same into which
Brother Caleb conducted Charles Lester, an
hour ago.
Brother Caleb is there. His back toward
Lemuel, he holds the light extended in his
right hand, and pauses before a narrow
door-way
,
which is sunken in the thickness of the
wall.
The door of the Iron Room! mutters
Lemuel.
Through that door, you remember, not long
ago, Charles Lester disappeared.
Lemuel does not pause, although his blood
is cold and hot by turns  although his heart
leaps to his throat. He glides on tip-toe across
the floor, he stands directly behind Brother
Caleb, as Brother Caleb is gazing upon the
panel of the narrow door.
It is a moment of feverish suspense.
Clenching his hands, Lemuel surveys the
tall form of Goodleigh, awaiting with set
teeth and hushed breath, the moment when he
shall turn and look into his face.
It rocks, this cursed stairway, but I shall
soon gain its summit, thus Brother Caleb, still
asleep, murmurs as he ascends the stairway of
his dream.
The sound of his voice, breaking so abruptly
upon the stillness, penetrates Lemuel at once
with the extremity of cowardice and hardihood.
He is resolved to dare the worst, although
he trembles in every nerve.
Brother Caleb turns, and looks into the face
of Lemuel, with his glassy eyes.
Here, at the entrance of the Iron Room, let
us leave them for a little while, and take up
the adventures of Charles Lester. It is an
hour since he passed that threshold. Let us
relate the history of that hour.
CHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND.
THE IRON ROOM.
Charles Lester, unconscious of threatened
evil, passed through the narrow doorway, and
surveyed the place, which was disclosed in all
its details, by the light of his candle.
It was a room or closet not more than six
feet square. The walls, the ceiling and the
floor were formed by solid panels or plates of
iron. There was no window in these iron
walls; no other entrance to the closet, than the
doorway through which Charles had passed.
It looks like a coffin, said Charles with a
smile, as the flame of his upraised candle,
well-nigh
touched the ceiling: It was doubtless
built into the thick walls, long ago, as a place
of safety for title deeds and gold. But now,
there is nothing in the place that I can see,
neither chest nor money-bag. Not even a
window  yes! upon my word there
is an aperture near the ceiling, about a foot
square. Does it open in the neighboring closet
Goodleigh?
He turned on his heel, surprised by the
silence
of Goodleigh, and beheld  with what
emotions you may imagine  that not only
Goodleigh, but also, the secret door had
disappeared
.
The wall before his gaze was
composed
of iron panels of equal dimensions,
reaching from the iron ceiling to the iron floor,
but all traces of the secret passage had been
suddenly obliterated.
Charles slowly paced the narrow space, in
which he found himself a prisoner, examining
with a careful scrutiny every point of the iron
panels, every foot of the iron floor. The only
opening in the walls  that aperture twelve
inches square, in one corner, and near the
ceiling  did not escape his observation.
What does Goodleigh mean? To make
me a prisoner in this closet? The idea seems
incredible, and yet the man is capable of
almost
anything in the form of treachery.
He soon became conscious that the candle
which he held, began to loose the brightness of
its rays, burning dim and faint, as with the
pressure of a confined and unwholesome
atmosphere
.
And then his chest began to heave and
swell, and an uneasy sensation agitated the
muscles of his throat.
He cast an affrighted glance over the sombre
walls which enclosed him, above, around, and
below, as a coffin shuts in the dead.
He beat his clenched hand against the panels,
seeking with a pallid cheek and brightening
eye, the spring or lock which commanded the
secret door. Holding the light in one hand,
he thrust the other through the square
aperture
near the ceiling, but it encountered nothing
but the air. All his exertions to discover a
mode of egress from this vault above ground,
were in vain. The air became more dense
and difficult to breathe. The light, every
instant, burned with a fainter lustre. Charles
Lester, imprisoned within these iron walls,
felt a chill creep through every vein, while his
brain swam, as in a deadly vertigo.
Goodleigh! Goodleigh! he shouted, but
the iron ceiling flung back his voice without an
echo. Goodleigh! Release me, and I
promise
eternal silence.
He spoke with difficulty. There was, of
course, no answer to his frenzied exclamations.
Death in any form but this, he gasped,
But here it seems I am
buried alive
. And
while I am dying here, the poor girl, perchance
in the next room, is listening to the voice of
Edmund Jervis  listening to the voice, which
once spoke Ellen's death-sentence, and which
never speaks, save to betray!
Let us draw the veil over the mental agonies
of the imprisoned man.
No words can depict the horror which
palsied
his soul while an hour passed away.
At the end of the hour, behold him, prostrate
on the iron floor, his eyes feverish with
despair, uplifted to the solitary aperture near
the ceiling.
Near his arm stood the candle, its pale light
illumining with but a faint glare the surface
of the iron panels.
Was it the sound of human voices, that
reached the ears of the bewildered man?
Voices, heard through the aperture, and broken
in their distinctness by walls of brick and
stone? Was it the voice of Fanny, or the
accents of the Preacher, which came faint
and murmuring to the leaden ear of Charles
Lester?
Even as he listened, his consciousness slowly
faded from him. He sank on his back, with
his hands outspread, and his face toward the
ceiling. The dim light glowed faintly upon
his pale face, and tinted with faint color the
masses of his dark brown hair. Overpowered
as much by the disease, which had for months
been slowly working at his heart-strings, as by
the confined atmosphere of the Iron Room,
Charles Lester has laid himself down to die.
That disease, solely the result of long
continued
mental anguish, defies all medical
analysis
.
It kills its victim by slow degrees. What
Physicians call it, I cannot tell; but to me it
seems to be only the destruction of the body,
by the silent action of the soul. The soul, by
its will, desires to surrender to earth, its
earthborn
organization. It wishes to be free: sick
of earth, it pants for the pure air of a Better
World.
And brave Charles Lester, whose life has
been wrecked in its youth of hope, by the
deliberate crime of a consecrated Minister, has
laid himself down to die. His lip moves, his
eyes unclose, his hand is stretched forth toward
the light, and then he is motionless as stone.
The candle sheds only a feeble and dying
ray.
Meanwhile, in the next room the Preacher
is alone with the daughter of Alice Bayne.
Not in the room through which Lester reached
the closet of Iron. But in the chamber which
lies beyond yonder the aperture in the panels.
That aperture opens into a closet, and beyond
the closet, lies the room which we are about to
enter.
While Charles Lester is dying, let us slowly
lift the curtain from one of the most glorious
scenes in the Preacher's life.
CHAPTER TWENTY-THIRD.
THE STUDY OF THE PREACHER.
Tread lightly, reader, and compose your
features into a look of reverence and awe
for we are about to enter the
Study of the
Preacher
. In the third story of his
mansion
,
Brother Caleb has set this chamber apart,
as the especial haunt of Edmund Jervis. Here,
when sick of the world, and eager to escape its
crowds of flatterers, the good man may
withdraw
within himself, and devote an hour to
uninterrupted meditation.
It is a small chamber, with one door, leading
into the entry on the third floor, and two
windows, looking into the wide street. Now
the windows are closed; the very panes are
covered with silken hangings. The walls
are covered with a light drapery of faint
crimson
,
spotted with gold and silver flowers. A
lamp, shaded by a clouded glass, sheds a rich
and softened light through the apartment.
That lamp stands upon a desk, which is
covered with volumes of sermons, with loosely
scattered letters, and with pen, inkstand, and
letter-paper. Beside the desk, an opened trunk,
packed with fashionable attire, and with
disguises
,
suitable for any adventure which may
chance to engage the mind of our Popular
Preacher. Amid the heap of fine apparel, a
manuscript volume peeps into light, bearing on
its first broad page, in the delicate hand-writing
of Jervis himself, this significant title
Memoirs
of a Preacher
.
To be published after
my death
.
Near the trunk, is a marble dressing-stand,
well furnished with all the details of an
exquisite's
toilette:
phials of perfumes, patchoulli,
orange, cologne; cakes of scented soap; oil for
the Preacher's hair, and cosmetics for the
Preacher's skin. A half-dozen of the finest
cambric handkerchiefs, carefully laid one upon
the other, complete the picture.
Look at it as you will, the room with crim
son hangings, spotted with gold and silver
flowers, is a very comfortable place, in every
way adapted, for the more retired devotions
of the Popular Preacher.
He is sitting in a velvet cushioned chair,
near the desk. He has thrown his frock coat
aside. A gaily flowered dressing gown floats
in loose folds from his shoulders to his
slippered
feet. A spotless vest, with a rolling
collar, clothes his chest, and entwines his
slender
waist. Resting his elbow on the back of
the chair, crossing one leg over the other, in an
attitude of careless ease, he gazes intently, yet
with a smile, upon the face of the Poor Girl.
Opposite, also seated on a velvet cushioned
chair, with her hands placed on her knees,
and her eyes glassy with the magnetic
slumber
,
behold the unconscious maiden.
Does she not look very beautiful, as the
mild radiance falls over her warm cheek, and
bathes the tresses of her raven hair? Still clad
in the velvet boddice, which reaching from the
waist to the neck, discloses the outline, while
it leaves the entire loveliness of her shape to
the imagination: still enveloped in the blue
skirt, which flows in loose folds from her waist
to her feet, behold the Daughter of Alice
Bayne, as her soul is entirely subject to the
will of the Popular Preacher.
A half an hour may have elapsed, since the
good man entered this room.
In that time, he has gathered from her lips
all the mysteries of her life, which in her
waking state, she herself could not know.
No longer opposed by the antagonist Will
of Charles Lester, he has commanded her soul
to traverse every scene of her life, from the
hour when Alice her mother sank into death,
until the present moment, when she is face to
face with Edmund Jervis.
He gazes at her, with one of those smiles
which make his face look young and even
handsome. Listen to his half-spoken
soliloquy
:
And soh, my pretty one, you are not
altogether
the child of poverty and shame! A
rich man's child  is it so? And your father
did not drown himself in the Schuylkill,
seventeen years ago? Arthur Bayne lived
fled to the west  took the name of Arthur
Baldwin, and became eminent as a Physician.
And Arthur Baldwin lived in that town of
Prairie-Home, which was also the native place
of Ellen Lester. He attended Ellen in her
last hours  and to Ellen's Brother confided
the secret of his life  of your life, and of your
brother's  for it seems you have a brother.
Soh, soh, this explains Lester's presence in
Philadelphia. He has money  money for
you  well, well. I am wearing away, and
need the comforts of a home. We will be
married Fanny, my child: married my dear.
Lester may oppose the match, but there is one
way, by which his consent may be forced.
Let me place all the strength of circumstances
on my side.
Making one or two passes, with both hands,
the Preacher soon aroused the girl from her
magnetic slumber. Her eyes began to assume
their natural lustre. Rosy flushes of warmth
gave a new light to her cheek. Her bosom
heaved with an even and natural pulsation.
After a few moments she started in her chair
and looked around with a vague stare, like one
who has been suddenly aroused in the depth
of a dreamless slumber.
Where am I? cried Fanny, looking at the
hangings, the desk, the lamp, and then
surveying
her own form, clad in such unusual attire.
Where am I? It is a dream. I am not
awake.
You are awake, my child, was the kind
response of the Preacher: Awake, and in
the care of your friends.
My mother  faltered Fanny, raising her
hand to her brow, in an effort to recover the
control of her memory.
Your mother is well, that is the person
who has passed for your mother is well. But
my child, you must listen to me. I have a
singular revelation to make. A few hours ago,
while I was preparing to accompany you to
the home of your supposed mother
My
supposed
mother! echoed Fanny.
You fainted, yes, my child, you fainted,
whether from anxiety, or from too long
exposure
to the cold, I cannot tell. I then
discovered
it matters not how  that you are
the child of a dear and valued friend of mine,
who lives out west, in the State of Illinois. I
am lately from the west, my dear. I am
charged to seek you out, and bring you back
to the arms of your father. Instead of being
the daughter of the poor woman with whom
you have resided, you are the child of the
wealthy Dr. Arthur Baldwin, of Prairie-Home,
Illinois.
Fanny opened her beautiful dark eyes, in a
vague and dreamy stare.
It cannot be so, she exclaimed  You
are making sport of me
It can, and it is, my child, said the
Preacher emphatically, as he drew his chair
nearer to the girl: Seventeen years ago, your
father resided in this city. Your mother died,
my dear, in the act of giving you life. But
mark you, the person whom you call by the
name of mother
She
is
my mother, Ann Jones, and my
name is Fanny Jones, exclaimed Fanny,
clenching her small hand, as she spoke in a
tone of decided emphasis.
This Ann Jones, having an old grudge
against your father, stole both you and your
brother
Ralph, ejaculated Fanny.
From the paternal roof. Your father
sought for his children for two years, and
sought in vain. At last broken-hearted, he
went to the west, to die. But he mastered
his sorrows, became successful as a Physician,
and is at the present time, the wealthiest man
in his county. Six months ago, he was
informed
by a Philadelphian, that Ann Jones
was still in existence, and that she lived in an
obscure court, with two children, whom she
called her own, but whom it was strongly
surmised
,
did not belong to her. I need not tell
you that this made the deepest impression on
your father. Aware that I was about coming
to Philadelphia, he entrusted the management
of this matter to me. And to-night, my child,
I left you insensible in the care of my good
friend Caleb. I hastened to your residence.
I listened to the confession of this Ann Jones
she believed it to be her last confession, but
she will recover  and from that confession,
I derived a knowledge of the truth. You are
the child of Arthur Baldwin! To-morrow
you leave Philadelphia, on your way to the
house of your father! You and your brother,
will together journey to the west, under my
care. Now, do you understand me, my good
child!
Smooth and persuasive were the accents of
the Preacher. Fanny heard every word,
looking
all the time into that face, where honor and
sincerity seemed to have made their
immoveable
stamp.
No! No! I cannot believe it! she cried,
clasping her hands, while her form was agitated
in every pulse: It is a dream  only a
dream
Again the Preacher spoke. Taking her
hand he told the story over again, and
confirmed
its every point, by new and
overwhelming
evidence. Fanny was forced to believe in
spite of herself. She did not swoon with the
surprise; but her cheek grew death-like; she
swayed to and fro upon her chair, and would
have fallen to the floor, had not the Preacher
caught her in his arms.
Yes, yes, you shall see your father, he
said, gazing upon her face, which pale and
flushed by turns, was bathed in tears. In
less than a month, you shall see him, my
child. He kissed her kindly  perchance
warmly  on the lips: Ralph, your brother,
shall go with you  again he pressed his
mouth to her lips  and this poor Ann Jones
shall be forgiven, and cared for.
The Preacher placed her on her chair again,
twining his fingers in the waves of her loosened
hair  in an absent way of course  as he
exclaimed: To-night you will rest in this
house, my dear  to-morrow we begin our
journey.
Poor Fanny utterly bewildered, shaded her
eyes from the light, and remained for some
moments absorbed in thought.
Had a thought ever crossed her brain before,
that instead of being the child of poverty and
want, she was indeed the daughter of
respectability
and wealth?
It is needless to tell you, reader, that the
truth of her life, had, in the mouth of the
Preacher, been interwoven with a web of
intricate falsehood.
Arthur Bayne had in reality fled to the west,
and risen into eminence as a Physician, under
the name of Arthur Baldwin. He had been
long convinced of the death of his children,
when he received intelligence from an
unknown
person that Annie and Harry were
still living, under the care of Ann Clarke.
Before his decease (which took place at
Prairie-Home
soon after the death of Ellen,) he en
trusted Charles Lester with his last Testament,
which bequeathed all his real estate, together
with fifteen thousand dollars in money, to his
lost children, Annie and Harry Bayne.
In his dying moments, he besought Charles
to hasten to Philadelphia and make search for
these children. In case the search proved
unsuccessful
,
Charles Lester would become his
heir.
The other details connected with this trust,
the reader will doubtless gather from the
current
of our history.
From the young girl, while in the magnetic
state, the Preacher derived a full knowledge
of these facts, which he distorted in order to
suit his own purposes.
I will see my father! whispered Fanny,
with an accent of inexpressible rapture as she
lifted her eyes to the light, while her face
kindled into a warm loveliness, that was hallowed
by her tears: I shall see my father! And
Ralph will be removed from the city, from want,
from cold, from misery and temptation! O,
the news is too good to be true!
Very beautiful was Fanny, as she bent
forward
in her chair, clasping her hands and
raising
her streaming eyes to Heaven.
You can't imagine what a beautiful valley
of the prairie spreads around your father's
home! The Preacher spoke in his
blandest
whisper, and with persuasion  eloquence
in his sparkling eyes: There it stands  I
see it now  a white mansion, amid a grove of
oaks, with a garden on one side and a wide
sweep of lawn on the other. Through the trees
you catch a glimpse of the river, and as you
wander
upon the lawn, the deer, browsing quietly,
as though impressed with the peaceful
atmosphere
of the place, raise their large eyes but
do not start and tremble at your tread. And
then the flowers, my child, O, you should see
the flowers! They clothe the prospect on
every side, grouping at the feet of the old trees,
starting up from the grass, trembling over the
river, until you might imagine yourself in
Eden.
Fanny uttered an ejaculation of delight.
Beneath the dark boddice her bosom heaved
and fell, as with the very fullness of youth
and hope. The Preacher surveyed her
ardently
and continued:
A road passes near your father's house.
In a week or so, my child, we will stand at
the entrance of your father's place. With
you on one arm and Ralph on the other, I will
lift the latch of the gate, and enter the walk
which winds among the trees, up to your
father's door.
Yes  yes  gasped Fanny.
He will come forth to meet us! I see him
stand upon the porch  his venerable hairs
bathed in the morning sun. He beholds you
as you draw near. He pauses for a moment
in doubt, and then you hear his voice, as he
comes trembling to you with outspread arms
`My Daughter! My Son!' And then, ah!
then the lost children will find a father and a
home!
Father! Father! cried Fanny, starting
from the chair, as the picture drawn by the
Preacher took bodily shape before her eyes.
She spread forth her arms as if to clasp her
father's neck. Blushing, trembling, panting,
she fixed her eyes upon vacancy, as though
there, in the twilight of the room, she beheld
the mild face of her father smiling welcome to
his long lost daughter.
But this is not all  exclaimed the
Preacher, starting to his feet and taking her
hand within his own. This is not all,
for
A slight sound, heard audibly through the
profound stillness, interrupted his words. It
was very much like the creak of a suddenly
opened door. The Preacher turned his head
over his shoulder, and as his glance pierced
the shadows, a deep ejaculation escaped his
lips:
Curse me, why didn't I lock the door.
Frightened at the changed expression of the
Preacher's face, Fanny turned as if to gaze
upon the cause of his alarm, and in the action
fell forward upon his breast.
I've heer'd you talk considerable. Thought
I'd drop in and take a look for mesself. How
air you?
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTH.
MAGIC IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.
A tall, broad-shouldered form, advanced to
the circle of light, as these words pronounced
in a gruff bass, penetrated Fanny's ears.
Fanny supported by the Preacher's arms, her
face upon his bosom, cast a sidelong glance
upon the intruder.
She beheld a huge, almost gigantic form,
attired
in a singular costume, composed of a cap
of course grey fur, a scarlet great coat
ornamented
with buttons the size of a dollar, and
corduroy pantaloons inserted in the tops of
ox-hide boots.
Above a plaid neckerchief, appeared a hardy
face, tanned by wind and sun, with whiskers
white as snow, and eyes brilliant as lighted
coals.
I'm sixty years old, said the Giant:
Heap of rascals I've known in my time.
Pour 'em all into a mould and run 'em out
into one com-
plete
scoundrel and yit that
scoundrel won't hold a candle to
you!
From one pocket the Giant Peter  for it
was our old friend  drew forth something very
much like a pistol, and from the other, he
produced
another something, which might have
been a gag and which might have been a
gridiron
.
I've heer'd you. I know you. I say
his voice growing deeper and hoarser, quivered
as with rising rage
I know'd Ellen!
The Preacher appeared to be much
surprised
by this intrusion. Scarce conscious that
he held the trembling girl in his arms, he
looked towards the huge Peter, but did not
seem to see him, nor to be conscious of his
presence.
Come g-a-l. Come 'long with me, said
Peter, dropping the something which looked
like a gag, into his pocket, and extending his
brawny hand.
It's a robber, whispered the Preacher.
No, no, I will not go with you, cried
Fanny, scarce knowing what she said, as she
clung to the Preacher's neck.
You won't? Peter burst into a roar of
laughter  Good
that
. Tell you he's a
scoundrel. Druv Ellen to her grave. Killed
her Father. Killed her brother. A devil in a
white cravat. Come 'long. I 'spose your
Doctor Baldwin's da'ter  Charley told me
sutthin' and I heer'd the rest.
No, no, I will not go with you, faltered
Fanny, clinging yet closer to the Preacher.
You must go with me? cried Peter, tell
you gal he's been lyin' too. It's his way.
9
Told you Dr. Baldwin was alive. A lie gal.
Dr. Baldwin's dead. Been dead this year.
Fanny heard these words, and turning her
head over her shoulder, looked into Peter's
face, with an expression of vague terror.
My father dead? It cannot be! She
turned to the Preacher, looking into his eyes,
her breath fanning his face: He is not dead!
Speak! O, you would not deceive me!
Your father lives, my child, whispered
the Preacher: This person knows nothing
of you or your family.
Peter seized his pistol by the barrel, as
though it were a mace or club.
I give you two minnits to let go the gal
and come along with me, his voice was
hoarse with anger, and his eyes shone with a
significant expression: Jist refuse, and I'll
tip you over as I would a mad dog.
He drew nearer, and clenched the pistol
with a determined grasp. Jervis began to
recover
from the overwhelming surprise and
dismay
,
occasiond by the sudden intrusion of the
giant Peter. A thought flashed through his
brain. Could he but carry this thought into
action, all his plans might be accomplished
without difficulty.
Whar's Lester? asked Peter; What
have you done with the boy?
Be seated, my child, whispered Jervis
forcing Fanny into a chair; Now Sir, I am
prepared to listen to you. Thus speaking,
he confronted the giant, gazing steadily into his
face, as he inserted his thumbs into the
armpits
of his white vest.
Fanny shuddered as she remarked the
contrast
between the two.
Peter, strong and rugged, his huge form
clad in a red overcoat, which displayed the
magnitude of his burly chest. The Preacher,
slender and diminutive  at least in
comparison
his graceful form, enveloped in the folds
of a loose dressing gown. One armed not
only with a giant's strength, but with a deadly
weapon; the other, altogether inferior in
strength, and without pistol or weapon of any
kind.
W-a-l? said Peter, with a burst of
laughter
:
You aint a-goin' to fight,
air
you?
You are armed, I am defenceless, said
the Preacher: You can crush me with
superior
strength, yes, you can kill me with a sin
gle blow of your brawny fist. But that would
n't be a
coward's
deed  would it, my friend?
Peter dropped the pistol into his pocket.
Never use fire-arms to reptyles, he
exclaimed
,
extending his open hand: Thar!
D'ye see
that?
While Fanny, clasping her hands, surveyed
the twain, with a look of terror and suspense,
the Preacher, still calm, although very pale,
devoted every faculty of his soul to the
accomplishment
of his Thought.
You are a strong man, he whispered,
and yet you are afraid to let me grasp your
hand.
Peter laughed all over his sunburnt face.
I
am
rather afeerd, he chuckled, Thar!
Don't hurt me! Please don't, that's a good
man.
He extended his brawny hand, which the
Preacher clutched in a peculiar manner.
Now is the moment for my
thought
, he
muttered: If it fails I am lost.
For a moment, he grasped the brawny hand,
without speaking a word, while his eyes,
flashing with steady light, were fixed upon the
eyes of the giant. Peter regarded him with a
grimace of pretended terror
Don't hurt me if you please! he said.
Fanny, half starting from the chair, watched
the issue of the scene, with quivering
suspense
.
Now, Sir, you are afraid to extend your
right arm, whispered the Preacher, still
grasping the left hand of the giant: Afraid I
say!
Thar it is,  and Peter quite jocularly,
extended his right arm, clenching his fist in
the action. It don't look like gallopin'
Consumption
hey?
The Preacher gave a sudden and peculiar
pressure to Peter's left hand, and then
whispered
:
Now if you dare, stretch forth your other
arm! he released the hand, and made a rapid
pass, from the giant's temples to his brawny
chest.
Peter stretched forth his left arm, and
clenched his left hand. Thus, with both arms
extended, throwing his brawny chest into light,
he resembled the figure of a colossal cross.
The Preacher stooped and touched him on
the knees. Then rising again, he rapidly
passed his hands over the arms, breast, and
mouth of our good friend Peter.
Now, Sir, he cried in a voice which
swelled deep and bold through the stillness:
You cannot close your arms! You cannot
move a foot  You cannot open your mouth!
I defy you! You are in my power! Aye,
struggle, if you will  it is out of your power
to move or speak!
Was this Magic? Starting to her feet in
wonder, Fanny beheld the huge form of the
giant, standing in the centre of the room,
motionless
as a figure of stone, save that a slight
movement, agitated his closed lips and
outstretched
arms.
You are in my power! You cannot
speak  You cannot move! I defy you to do
either! Fanny, my child, look upon this
palsied
wretch, and behold the power of Heaven!
The Preacher solemnly raised his right hand
above his head.
You would steal this child from my care?
Speak, if you can! Dr. Baldwin is dead
is he, indeed?
Stiffened in every nerve, palsied in every
fibre of his giant frame, Peter stood with
outstretched
arms, closed lips and clutched hands
stood like a frozen man  without the power
of speech or motion.
The Preacher, flushed and triumphant, still
raised his hand to heaven, and defied the
palsied
man to speak or move.
It is the hand of Heaven! gasped Fanny,
as she surveyed the strange scene with a
feeling
of irrepressible terror. He came hither
with a lie on his lips, and the lie has choked
his utterance.
The Preacher hastily took his frock-coat
from a chair, and in a moment it replaced the
dressing-gown. Then placing his hat upon
his brown hair, he passed Fanny's arm through
his own.
Come, my child, he whispered, Heaven
has placed this man in our power; let us leave
him to the contemplation of his sins!
Alas for Peter!
He saw the Preacher and the girl pass
before
him, but had not the power to move or
speak. Turning his head over his shoulder,
he gazed into the shadows, and beheld the
Preacher in the act of taking the key from the
lock, while Fanny was gliding through the
opened door-way. And yet Peter stood with
arms outstretched and lips sealed, his sinews
writhing, his face distorted by his struggles.
He saw the Preacher pass through the
door-way
,
saw the door close after him, and the
next instant heard the sound of the key turning
in the lock.
And ere that sound had died upon his ears,
the power of speech and motion returned to
him, like the gift of a new life. At the same
moment, he closed his arms violently upon his
chest, started forward as if to test his power
over his lower limbs, and opened his mouth to
its utmost capacity.
It's the Devil hisself! shouted Peter,
brandishing his arms, and lifting his feet one
after the other  The rale Devil, and no
mistake.'
He hurried to the door; it was locked; the
panels were one solid piece of time-hardened
oak, and apparently impenetrable.
Peter was a prisoner in the Preacher's
study.
At the same moment, separated from him by
thick walls, and panels of rivetted metal,
Charles was dying in the Iron Room, while
Caleb and Lemuel stood by its narrow door.
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIFTH.
MAGIC EXPLAINED.
You ask the secret of the Preacher's power
over the giant frame of the hardy Peter?
Was it magic, wizard-craft, or animal
magnetism? It was none of these. Magic
demands incantations, wizard-craft must work
by spells, and animal magnetism can only act
when it is favored by a compliant Will.
Magnetism thoroughly destroys, for the time,
all consciousness through the senses. It is the
operation of one Will over another, and can
never be accomplished in its important phases,
unless the
subject
yields his will captive to the
will of the operator.
Yet here in the case of Peter, we have a
strong man, in the full possession of his
every-day
faculties, stricken suddenly into a paralysis
of speech and motion, while his Will, more
powerful even than the Will of the Preacher,
resists with all its force.
How shall I explain this?
Let us suppose for the moment, that the
substance or element called
electricity
, is the
agent by which Mind acts upon Matter, or to
speak more plainly, the instrument by which
the Brain commands the motion of the Arm
and Tongue. Comprehend this in all its
phases, and then admit a second supposition.
Suppose that you can control the
electricity
of another person  control it against that
person's
will  by touching a certain nerve in the
hand, the finger, or the arm? This control
once obtained, accompanied at the same time
by an impression upon the subject's mind
does it not follow that all his powers of
muscular
motion, are, for the time, made prisoner
to your pleasure?
Thus, the Preacher, inferior in strength and
will to our friend Peter, obtained the mastery
over his muscular powers, against his will, by
controlling the
electric force
of his organization.
Advance a step farther. Admit that the
senses do not reside in the tongue, the eye, the
ear, the hand, and the nostrils, but in the brain.
That brain can only act by
electric force
.
Make an
impression
then upon the
electricity
of the brain, and it follows that the subject
will see, taste, smell, touch, hear and feel, at
your pleasure.
These suppositions, which recent
discoveries
have established as facts, fully explain all
the wonders of magic and witchcraft.
We have seen, more than one incredulous
person who laughed with all his soul at the
very mention of these discoveries in science,
suddenly confounded into involuntary belief.
The unbeliever has been made to taste, hear,
see, smell, and feel in accordance to the will of
another person. Thus a glass of water, has been
changed into acid, into wine, into honey
changed not in reality, but to the taste  by an
impression
produced by the operator upon the
electric force
of the subject's brain. We have
seen with our eyes, and experienced in our own
person, wonders that far exceed the most
improbable
legends of magic  wonders that appear
miraculous and yet cease to be wonders at all,
when the secret of their operation is explained by
a reference to the unchangeable laws of Nature.
Our limits will not permit a complete
discussion
of the science. But hundreds of
persons
in Philadelphia and New York, persons
of all shades of disposition, temperament and
intellect, can testify to the performance of ex
periments, in their presence and upon them
personally, which mock the powers of belief,
and leave the exploits of olden time sorcery, far
in the distance. And unlike the history of
ancient magic, the cause of these experiments
is not made a mystery, nor surrounded with
all the display of scenic effect, and theatrical
pomp. The
cause
is known to the persons who
witnessed the experiments; and the cause, which
we but crudely describe is as simple and as
scientific
in its explanation as the operations of
the law of gravity.
The
fact
that a man like the Preacher,
exercised
such control upon the physical powers
of a giant like Peter, was known to us long
before we became acquainted with the
cause
.
Indeed such facts are scattered copiously over
the history of all ages. That the Preacher
abused the knowledge of the great Truth, is
no more an argument against its reality and
its benefits to mankind, than his abuse of the
Gospel, to purposes the basest, is an argument
against the truth and benefits of Revelation.
In our history, a knowledge of the great
Facts of Electricity, and its Connection with
the Brain, is used by a bad man for the
accomplishment
of a bad end.
But this knowledge, properly developed, is
capable of the greatest benefit to the human
family. By it may be cured, or at least
alleviated
,
one half of the diseases which afflict the
human organization. Through its influence,
all those diseases, especially, which spring
from the Mind, and from the operation of
Mind upon Matter, may be swept from the
history
of human suffering.
*
*
The knowledge of this great science, has lately
been developed, in a series of lectures, delivered in
New York and Philadelphia, by Dr. John Bovee Dods
and the Rev. Theophilus Fiske. In these lectures
the science was termed  Psychcological Electricity.
Thousands of the first citizens of New York and
Philadelphia
can attest, from their own observation and
experience, the apparently miraculous character of these
experiments.
Not the least important of its benefits, is the
fact, that it rears a platform on which Reason
and Faith may meet in concord. It crushes
scepticism, and not by calling infidel!  but by
unrolling the curtain which has for ages
concealed
those simple and awful Laws by which
God governs the Universe  not the Universe
of worlds alone, but also the Universe of
Immortal
Souls.
In the Dark Ages, men of learning were
doubtless familiar with these great truths. But
they were forced by fear of priestly faggot or
mob outrage, to cloak them in a veil of scenic
mystery.
So, in the Dark Ages, Priests of the Church
either from fear of man or want of faith in God,
cloaked under a drapery of cumbrous mystery
the great facts of Religion:
That all men are
brothers, and God is the Father of all. To
do good to men, is to truly worship God.
The brotherhood of mankind and the
all-paternal
character of God, are the vital
truths, hidden under all forms of Religion
.
And then Priests and Learned Men, instead
of making Faith and Reason, and Science and
Religion meet in concord, took isolated paths,
and cursed the world with a barbarous Faith
and a mountebank Philosophy.
But the day comes, when the heart of the
child and the brain of the learned man, will
arrive by different paths, at the same great
centre: when Reason will be married to Faith:
and both Faith and Reason terminate their
pilgrimage
at the altar of God.
Every step in scientific discovery, is also a
step gained towards this altar.
Two great truths we should gird forever to
our hearts:
The Scientific man, whose researches
in science do not confirm and enlarge the
belief in God and Immortality, is a false
Philesopher
,
who gropes his way every hour far
and farther from the throne of God.
The Priest, whose faith does not teach
him that God as the Father of all mankind,
wishes and will accomplish the salvation of all,
is a false Prophet, also groping his way from
darkness unto deeper darkness.
The false Priest and the false Philosopher,
are twin-blasphemers.
Their Faith and Reason are alike corrupt.
Their teachings are a mockery of Humanity
and a denial of God.
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIXTH.
PETER, FANNY, AND THE PREACHER.
Peter, Peter! You've got yerself into a
scrape, was the remark of the giant as he
tried the door: Preacher and gal both gone,
and here you air.
Peter flung himself against the door, kicked
its panels with all his might, and wrenched the
knob until the sinews started like whip-cords
on his iron wrist.
All his efforts however were fruitless. Ten
minutes elapsed while he was occupied in this
manner.
What's become of Charley? If he should
happen to meet the Preacher a-goin' down
stairs! The reptyle! If I only had a club
I'd send them panels into splinters in a minnit.
Hello! I've an idea. You're stupid Peter,
not to think of it afore.
Drawing a pistol from his pocket, he levelled
it deliberately at the lock of the door. His
hand was on the trigger, when the key turned
in the lock again and the door sprung open.
At the same instant the room was filled by
a thick cloud of suffocating smoke, which
blinded the sight of the giant and forced him
to pant for breath.
Save yourself! Save yourself! cried a
voice  The house is on fire.
Through the cloud Peter beheld the form of
the Preacher, with the young girl lying pale
and insensible upon his breast.
And from the entry, through the opened
doorway the smoke continued to roll, in a
thick and stifling cloud. The light was
suddenly
darkened: that dense mass of smoke,
illumined by a lurid and hazy light, wrapped
the giant, the girl, and the Preacher, in its
folds.
To the window, cried Peter, stumbling
forward, Let's have a breath o' fresh air.
The windows are nailed shut, he heard
the voice of the Preacher in reply: Our only
hope of escape is  his voice was broken,
as if in the effort to get breath  is by the
roof.
Plunging about in the darkness, Peter
encountered
the door-way, and with a sudden
bound, endeavoured to pass from the threshold
to the head of the stairs. But the smoke drove
him back. He was blinded and stifled by the
dense cloud. Struggling through its folds, he
once more found himself in the room, and his
extended hand encountered the hand of the
Preacher.
You cuss you, don't you know that you'll
kill that gal, unless you git the winder open?
he muttered, as he gave the Preacher's hand a
wrench, which made him howl with pain
Wait a minnit! I'll burst the winder open
if I have to ram yer head through the sash!
He plunged forward through the gloom, and
fell over the Preacher's trunk, at the same
moment
crushing the lamp with his outstretched
hand.
Here we air, he cried, and raising the
trunk with both arms, dashed it at random
through the darkness. It chanced to encounter
the window, and a sound of crashing glass
announced that his effort was in part
successful
.
I am dying, moaned a faint voice, which
Peter scarcely recognized for the voice of the
Preacher  For God's sake, help! help!
help!
Peter felt the shutters, in the darkness. Felt
the bolts and bars, which held them close and
fast. Again he raised the trunk and hurled it
forward, with all the strength of his arms. The
shutters started  another blow  they flew
open  and Peter starting forward, thrust his
head from the window, and at the same instant
caught a glimpse of the day-break sky, and
inhaled
one deep breath of pure air.
A strange sight it was to see his red face
peeping from the window amid a cloud of thick
and inky smoke.
At a glance, Peter surveyed the street
beneath
,
and as he looked he saw the burly form
of Stewel Pydgeon passing down the marble
steps, in the act of emerging from the house,
while Stewel's hoarse voice awoke the echoes
of the night, with
Fi
-er! Fi-
er! Fi-er!
But no time was to be lost. Peter turned
from the window, and dragged the Preacher
from the darkness to the fresh air. In the
Preacher's arms lay Fanny, pale and beautiful
in her fantastic attire, her face resting on his
breast, while her hair streamed over his arms.
Don't kill me  don't  muttered the
Preacher, as in a half swooning state he
projected
his face from the open window  I
really didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're a purty magician, you are, gruffly
responded Peter. You can turn a live man
into a corpse, but you can't put out a house,
when it's a-fire. But let's have a-hold o' th'
gal  don't you see she's dyin'?
Lifting the unconscious girl from the arms
of the Preacher, Peter grasped her firmly in
his stalwart hands, and held her face toward
the pure air, while the smoke streamed in
a thick cloud, through the aperture of the
window.
The Preacher meanwhile moaned pitifully
Why don't they fetch the engines? Don't
they know that we'll be burned alive?
How'd the house get a-fire? growled
Peter, still endeavoring to recover the
unconscious
girl.
Went down stairs  into second story
was about to light a lamp  smelt fire
opened the door, and was stifled by the smoke
got up stairs with the girl, and managed to
find the door of this room.
The Preacher spoke with difficulty, his
language vague and almost incoherent, while
projecting his neck to its utmost capability, he
rested his hands upon the window frame, and
endeavored to inhale one long deep breath of
fresh air.
Could somebody have turned on the gas
and set it a-fire? muttered Peter, as he shook
the form of the girl, in the effort to restore her
to consciousness: But I guess it's been
burnin' down stairs, this hour and more, for I
smelt smoke when I first came in.
The wind without, blowing fresh and strong,
for a moment drove back the smoke into the
house. Our friends by the window
experienced
a sudden relief, and Peter with great
satisfaction
saw Fanny unclose her dark eyes, as
he grasped her in his arms.
Why don't the engines come? groaned
the Preacher, as he turned his face, pale and
distracted with affright, toward the giant.
Hark! D'ye hear that? The State House
Bell! And that! God bless us, the engines are
coming!
His voice fairly shrieked with the violence
of his joy. And at this moment, while Fanny
gazed around with a vacant glance, there came
a sound from the depths of the mansion, which
penetrated the Preacher's heart, like the echo
of his death-knell.
It was the low, deep roaring sound of a vast
body of flame, shut up within thick walls.
The house is burnin' away beneath us,
exclaimed Peter.
What is the matter? Where are we?
whispered Fanny, as she turned her gaze from
the frightened visage of the Preacher, to the
bluff, but imperturbable face of the giant.
We are parficly safe my dear. Just stick
your head out o' the winder, and get as many
mouth-fulls o' the fresh air as possible.
They are coming, they are coming!
shouted the Preacher, as the street below, was
suddenly illumined with a red glare of
torch-light
,
while the air echoed merrily with the sound
of the engine bells. Don't you see them?
They are fixing the hose to the fire-plugs
there! there!
The street echoed to the tramp of busy feet.
Crowds of men, half clad, hurried to and fro,
by the torch-light glare. The brass ornaments
of an engine, flashed back the light, as it was
hurled along, by the impulse of an hundred
manly arms. The street so lately still as the
grave, was now all light, confusion and uproar.
Quick! Quick! shouted the Preacher, as
he stretched forth his arms from the window:
Don't you see that we're burnin' to death:
Hall-oo! Murder!
I see him! cried Fanny, as far below
among the busy crowd, she saw a half-naked
form reddened by the torch-light: It is
Ralph!
Look here you cuss, is there anybody else
in the house? and Peter shook the Preacher
roughly by the arm.
Don't trouble me! All my books and
papers
,
all my clothes will be turned into
cinders
!
Why don't they bring a ladder?
Hall-oo!
But Peter was not thus to be denied.
Clenching the Preacher with his vice-like
grasp, he repeated his question, with a slight
addition in the way of rhetoric:
Anybody else in this house? Give us
an answer, or out you go from this winder,
by !
There's a man in the entry, gasped the
Preacher: I stumbled over him as I came
along.
Take the gal, you cowardly vagabon',
cried Peter, and ere the Preacher could
manifest
his astonishment by an ejaculation, the
giant had disappeared.
He had plunged once more into the cloud
of smoke.
Our history now returns to Brother Caleb
and the Converted Monk. They stood at the
door of the Iron Room, at least fifteen minutes
before the Preacher was driven back to his
Study, by the fire and smoke.
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENTH.
BROTHER CALEB REACHES THE TOP OF THE
STAIRWAY.
Brother Caleb, holding the light above his
head, turned slowly round, and gazed upon
Lemuel with his cold fixed eyeballs.
That gaze penetrated Lemuel with the very
extremity of fright and terror. The luxurious
folds of the dressing gown, which clothed
Brother Caleb's gaunt form, only increased
by contrast, the hideousness of his unearthly
countenance.
You can't scarce me,
Gatherwood
,
whispers Lemuel through his set teeth, as his
form trembles with the desperation of
cowardice
:
The time has gone by for that kind of
thing.
Another step, and I will reach the top of
this cursed stairway! murmurs Brother
Caleb
,
still absorbed by the adventure of his
dream.
His rigid face, motionless eyeballs, and
slowly muttered words, suddenly strike the
Converted Monk with an impression of the
truth.
A Somnambulist! the thought only half
escapes his lips. Walks in his sleep, does
he? I'll wake him up, when I have the proofs
of his guilt in my hands. Go on, my
dear
Gatherwood!
Bowing with much gravity, Lemuel uttered
these closing words, with a grimace,
accompanied
by a burst of half suppressed laughter.
Brother Caleb, still asleep, was of course
unconscious of his presence.
Turning, he touched the spring of the
narrow
door. It opened, and light in hand, he
crossed the threshold, imagining that he had
won another step on the stairway of his dream.
Lemuel stealthily creeping at his heels,
followed
him across the threshold, into the Room.
And Lemuel, with all his soul absorbed in the
contemplation of the movements of Brother
Caleb, did not observe a prostrate form which
was stretched upon the iron floor. His own
shadow added to the shadow of Brother Caleb,
completely veiled the prostrate form from
observation
.
Nor did Lemuel, watching with an
unchanging
glance, the movements of Brother Caleb,
behold the haggard face, which slowly uprose
from the shadows, gazing around with a dull
vacant gaze. It was the face of Charles
Lester
,
who aroused from his deathlike stupor, by
the current of fresh air, slowly raised his head,
and beheld the motionless form of Brother
Caleb, standing gaunt and erect, in the centre
of the Iron Room. And near Brother Caleb,
Charles beheld the slight figure of the
Converted
Monk, crouching behind the gaunt
form, like some noxious reptile, about to dart
upon its unconscious prey.
Charles slowly rose to his feet. But half
conscious, and impelled by an influence which
it is in vain to analyze, he crossed the
narrow
space which separated him from the
door-way
.
Lemuel heard the sound of his step, and
turned to him, suddenly whispering, Go
back, Stewel! but ere his words were uttered,
Charles had crossed the threshold, and closed
the narrow door.
Lemuel still believing that it was Stewel's
footstep that had disturbed his silent watch,
turned again, and watched with flaming eyes
the motions of his friend Gatherwood,
otherwise
known as Brother Caleb.
No! No! You will not drive me back!
groaned Brother Caleb, in a tone of acute
agony: Do not hurl me from this dreadful
height! Extend your hand  only for a
moment  and I will be saved!
Brother Caleb had attained the last step of
that stairway, leading into the clouds, when
there  upon the summit, amid white folds of
waving mist  appeared the figure of Alice
Bayne. There was a smile upon her
beautiful
face, and her golden hair waved freely to
her uncovered shoulders. But even as Brother
Caleb's foot touched the last step, the stairway
began to rock with a frightful motion. He
reached forth his arm, and attempted to clutch
her hand, but that hand evaded his grasp, while
the face of the beautiful woman was agitated
by a look of calm mockery. Brother Caleb
cast his eyes below  the awful height made
him dizzy. Thousands and ten of thousands
of fathoms of space, lay between him and the
solid earth. And Alice could save him  save
him by the single extension of her hand  but
Alice smiled in calm mockery, while she
murmured
in a calm musical voice, these words:
Dr. Gatherwood, my home was happy
before you passed its threshold! Give back
my home, my husband, and my children, and
then I will help you to ascend the stairway!
And while the stairway rocked like a reed
in the blast, Alice shook her golden hair, from
the summit, and taunted the poor wretch with
the history of his crimes.
Such was the course of Brother
Caleb's
dream, as he stood in the centre of the
Iron Room, with the keen eyes of Lemuel
Gardiner fixed upon his rigid face.
Alice! Thee must forgive me! cried
Brother Caleb, relapsing into the dialect of his
youth: Thee will not refuse to aid me!
Mercy, Alice, mercy upon me, or I will
fall
Brother Caleb strode madly forward,
thinking
that he was gaining the last step of the
dream-stairway, and Brother Caleb pitched
violently against the iron wall of the Iron
Room.
With cold sweat upon his forehead, he
awoke.
You may imagine his surprise, when the
reality succeeded to his dream. The form of
Alice, and the dizzy stairway had passed
away. He found himself in the Iron Room,
with the eyes of Lemuel Gardiner gazing into
his own.
Lemuel, with his narrow figure contracted
into the smallest possible compass, crouched
in one corner of the closet, his head sunken on
his breast, his chin resting on his hands,
pressed nervously against each other. And
thus Lemuel's eyes, looking upward from the
shadow of his compressed brows, imparted a
singular, almost ghostly character to his visage,
covered by a close-fitting skull-cap.
And Lemuel did not move  not even for an
instant change in the slightest degree, his
statue-like
position in the corner. Lemuel looked
for all the world like some mischievous animal,
of the lower order of the feline race, which,
while in pursuit of its victim, has been
suddenly
confronted by a more aristocratic beast
of greater capacity for carnage and destruction.
Very much like a cat, abruptly cornered by a
tiger, looked Lemuel, the Converted Monk.
What does this all mean? said Brother
Caleb after a long pause. His projecting
eyeballs
began to lose their vague and glassy
aspect
.
There was some trace of Captain
Bradburne of the Falcon in their glance.
Lemuel preserved his fixed attitude, but did
not reply.
I have not seen you these three months,
resumed Brother Caleb, holding the light above
his head, while he took a more attentive
survey
of Lemuel's face: Yes, it's three
possibly four months. What are you doing
here, in my house? Is this a `Chrismas Play'
to amuse the children?
Brother Caleb smiled with his imperceptible
lips; a sort of cadaverous smile, which only
deepened the hollows of his cheeks, while it
gave a sudden lustre to his eyes.
And Lemuel, crouching in the corner, saw
the smile  felt it too, in every pore of his
slender frame  and still had not a word in
answer.
Brother Caleb was wrapped in thought.
Placing the finger of his unoccupied hand,
between
his brows, he seemed earnestly engaged
in an effort, to recollect distinctly, the events
of the past four hours.
I have been walking in my sleep, he
exclaimed
,
and have wandered from my bed
to this room. The Iron Room! Eh! Where's
Lester? Did you see anything of Lester?
A miracle! Lemuel so glib in speech,
when acting in the character of a Converted
Monk, is now silent as the President of a
Broken Bank, when questioned concerning the
causes of its failure.
Who told
you
of this place? cried
Brother Caleb folding his blue gown about his
spare limbs: How came
you
into my house
at this hour? How dared you, Sir, to follow
me to the Iron Room?
Then Lemuel speaking in a bland and
whispering
voice, as he joined his hands, while his
face assumed a look of mock-gravity, uttered
this simple exclamation:
O, Reuben!
Now Brother Caleb had not heard that name
for many years.
Pronounced by his associate in the crimes
of seventeen years ago, it struck harshly upon
his ear, and with the memory of his late dream
still pressing heavily upon his brain, it sounded
like an accent uttered by some mocking Demon,
from the shadows of a dark and guilty Past.
The very audacity of this Lemuel  this
despised dupe and tool of former years
penetrated Goodleigh with an impression of
involuntary fear.
You have set yourself upon my track.
You have spied out the secret of this house.
You have even discovered the secret of this
room. Since the moment, now three months
ago, when I scorned you in the street, and
refused you the charity of a single dollar, you
have dogged me, like  like  he paused
for a word  like the common eaves-dropper
and vulgar busy-body that you are. And now
you have joined hands with this Lester  is it
so?
While Brother Caleb thus poured forth this
torrent of incoherent reproach, the Converted
Monk maintained his fixed position in the
corner, as silent as the iron walls against
which he leaned his crouching form.
Is it so? You have some petty plot
working in your craven brain? How much
must I pay for your silence? You have made
some discovery  eh? Have succeeded in
identifying Caleb Goodleigh, with Captain
Bradburne of the Falcon? Ho  ho!
Lemuel
,
you grow amusing in your old days.
This night, said Lemuel, speaking very
low, his chin still resting on his clenched
hands: This night, I witnessed the death of
Ann Clarke.
Goodleigh started  a convulsive motion of
his features was perceptible  but in an instant
he recovered his grim composure.
Did you? he blandly replied: Said she
anything of that child  the pledge of your
early loves?
Lemuel Gardiner was a despicable coward.
All his life had been devoted to despicable and
cowardly deeds. Through seventeen years of
baseness, he had slimed his way with a
devotion
to the smallest details of depravity, worthy
of one of those vulgar fiends, which make you
laugh and shudder, in the pages of some
grotesque
German story. But all his baseness,
rich at first in money, had at last left him
poor  miserably poor. He was now, at the
age of forty-seven  to a casual gazer he
O1
seemed not more than thirty  a desolate and
blasted man.
Virtue
he could not
understand
;
it was one of the incomprehensible
words in the Dictionary to him. But
Poverty
was a word that conveyed an intelligible, a
palpable idea to his dwarfed soul. Poverty
sounded in his ears, as Leprosy sounded in
the ears of the ancient Hebrews. And he was
poor  poor after seventeen years of perjury,
trick, and fraud  while Reuben Gatherwood,
his old-time associate, stood before him in
all the plenitude of Real Estate and Bank
Deposits. He was poor; forced to get his
bread by pandering a nightly stimulant to the
appetite of bigotry, in the shape of
No-Popery
Lectures, to drag his weary way
through the tortuous details of small
hypocrisies
,
and pettier hatreds, while Reuben
Gatherwood
the Apostate Physician and blaspheming
Slaver, was the Lord of half a million dollars.
Lemuel had been thinking of all this, for
three long months. Churning it over, while he
wandered dark streets, at dead of night, and
digesting it in his very soul, as he threaded
through the crowd of Chesnut street by day.
And Lemuel had long resolved upon revenge.
He did not hate Caleb because he was bad;
only because he was the Rich Scoundrel.
Resolved
upon revenge, in what form he had not
determined, Lemuel had spied out the secret
of Goodleigh's connection with the Falcon, or
rather spied out a clue to the proof necessary
for Goodleigh's conviction, before a Court of
Justice, for the identity of Goodleigh with
Captain Bradburne had been known to Lemuel
for many years.
This was the state of affairs with him, when
Ralph summoned him from the Church of St.
John  where he had wandered under the
influence of some lingering trace of early belief
to the bedside of the dying woman. But
his interview with Ann Clarke had altogether
changed the current of his ideas. It had left
upon him a shadow of overwhelming despair.
Perchance his brain, long fitted for the
reception
of mental disease, had suddenly been seized
with that most terrible form of insanity, known
as Monomania. There is a monomania which
makes the veriest coward brave. A purpose
of revenge, nursed in the very core of the
heart for weary days and nights  nursed in
dreams and elaborated slowly in the hours of
waking hatred  may at last ripen into the
two-fold
idea of Suicide and Murder.
Did this two-fold idea impart to Lemuel
Gardiner the courage to confront the man
whom he feared; feared supremely, and from
the depths of his coward nature?
Let us await the issue of the scene.
Said she anything of your child  the
pledge of your early loves?
Yes, replied Lemuel, and something of
Alice Bayne, the victim of your cowardly
outrage
.
Do you know that I've a mind to strangle
you? Caleb's voice was hoarse with
suppressed
rage. He advanced threateningly, but
Lemuel still crouched motionless in the corner.
Have you? Hush! Lemuel's voice
sounded like the accent of a woman who
endeavours
to still a boisterous child: Hush!
Reuben! The Police Officers may hear you.
They wait without.
Brother Caleb recoiled, as though a blow
from a strong man had stricken him in the
chest.
Have you dared? he whispered, Cur!
Why I could beat your brains against these
walls  beat out the miserable heart which rots
in your living body  and leave you here, in
this room, which in that case, should be your
only coffin. Who would ever hear of your
death? That door once closed, and your
carcass
would be shut up in darkness forever.
Lemuel advanced from the corner. His
lean shrunken figure dilated in its every fibre.
The door
is
closed, he said in a whisper,
and with a singular smile.
Caleb turned on his heel, and at a glance,
saw that the door of the Iron Room was
indeed
closed. Closed so tightly and effectually
that it was not distinguishable from the iron
walls.
And then Brother Caleb gave utterance to a
frightful oath, for
he knew not the secret of
the spring which opened the door from the
inside
.
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTH.
THE INSIDE SPRING.
When you bought the house, you were
informed of the existence of the Iron Room,
said Lemuel, remarking the changed
countenance
of Caleb with calm satisfaction: The
original owner built it with a particular object.
He wished to secure his title deeds and his
hoarded gold. Therefore  Reuben are you
listening? He procured the services of a
celebrated Locksmith. He had the door
constructed
in such a manner, that it opened and
shut with a secret spring. The burglar might
possibly discover the spring on the outside,
but once within the Iron Room, it was
imposible
to discover either the door, or the spring
which opened it from the
inside
. You have
heard these facts before?
Brother Caleb raised his hand to his
forehead
it was wet with beaded moisture. The
lamp quivered as he held it above his colorless
face.
You may remember that a burglar once
stole into this Room, while the `original
proprietor'
was absent from the city. He  the
proprietor  was absent for two weeks. When
he returned he visited this `patent safety chest'
and found the burglar's dead body, stretched
among piles of mortgages, and heaps of boxes,
filled with specie. Did you hear of it?
Again he paused, but it was now Caleb's
turn to be silent.
The secret of the `inside spring' died
with the former owner of the house
,
resumed
Lemuel. When you bought the
property
(Israel Bonus was the Conveyancer I
believe
?)
you were duly informed of the `
outside
spring
' but at the same time, told that the
secret of the `
inside spring
' (excuse this
reptition
,
Reuben) was lost forever. Do you
remember
?
It seemed indeed as if the power of speech
had passed from Caleb Goodleigh, as the
sound of Lemuel's voice penetrated his ears.
Frightfully pale, and shaking as with an
aguefit
,
he gazed toward the place where he
supposed
the door to be, with a vague yet earnest
look.
Lemuel, he whispered, after a long pause:
There is no need of any quarrel between us.
Let us go down stairs, and settle our dispute
over a bottle of wine. You know the secret
of that door  eh?
When I came to your house to-night, it
was in company with a Police Officer,
resumed
Lemuel: It was then my purpose to
procure proofs of your guilt, and have you
arrested in your bed. I left the Police
Officer on the first floor, while I went through
the apartments, in the wing of your mansion.
I was absent from his side only a few
moments
,
and when I came back, no change in
my countenance belied the nature of my
occupation
,
during this absence. He little dreamt,
poor fellow! that I had torn your splendid
carpet from the floor, and arrayed your
furniture
in a pyramid, and then set your Painted
Chamber in a blaze!
Goodleigh's face was agitated by a horrible
distortion.
By ! You are mad! You could
not think of such an infernal deed!
No worse than setting fire to a ship filled
with three hundred negroes, when a United
States Frigate is in sight, and your boat under
the stern. Eh, Goodleigh?
Come  you are raving! said Brother
Caleb, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
I did this, not fifteen minutes ago, and then
joining the police officer, came up stairs, in
order to ascertain whether you were fast asleep.
Lemuel's eyes blazed in the sunken sockets,
while his lips parted in a grimace  a grimace
that was the very extravagance of mockery.
This is a jest, Lemuel, said Caleb,
gnashing
his teeth  a jest for which you will pay
dearly
For which
both of us
will pay dearly,
interrupted the Converted Monk  But
as I reached the head of the stairs, I saw you
emerge from your room. I followed you, and
not until you reached the threshold of this
closet, did I discover that you were walking in
your sleep. Then the mere idea of burning
your house, with the chance of burning its
owner with it, was displaced by a much better
thought
A much better thought? echoed
Goodleigh
,
while the hand which held the lamp
began
to droop slowly from its raised position.
I thought of the `inside spring' of the Iron
Room. And from this thought arose a kindred
idea, which I put to myself in the form of a
question  `What if Dr. Reuben Gatherwood
should enter the Iron Room, enter it in his
sleep, and only awake to find himself shut up
in an Iron Coffin  an Iron Coffin enveloped
in the flames of blazing rafters?' It was a
fine question, Reuben  can you answer it?
The speaker stretched forth his arms, in the
very earnestness of his mockery, while his
eyes, that seemed to burn in their sockets,
assumed a wild and singular expression.
Brother Caleb at the same instant became
conscious of two facts, which promised to have
a decided influence upon the course of his life.
He was alone with a madman. It needed
not his medical lore to tell him that. The
eyes blazing in their sockets, the lips distorted
by a grimace, and whitened by an almost
imperceptible foam, the outstretched arms
swaying vaguely in the air  conveyed a
language which Brother Caleb could not
misunderstand
.
And this was only the first fact of which he
became suddenly conscious.
Looking over his shoulder, Brother Caleb
saw a slight cloud of smoke, issuing from the
aperture near the ceiling.
The house is in flames, and I am alone
with a madman! This was the thought
which Brother Caleb deduced from the two
important truths just mentioned.
Could he tame the madman by threats, by
promises, or by the magnetic power of the
eye? That strange power which the eye of a
sane man, has over the mind of the Insane?
Brother Caleb was so Rich  so very, very
Rich  and Lemuel Gardiner so Poor  so
miserably Poor!
And Brother Caleb must die in an Iron
Coffin, heated red hot by the flames of his
burning mansion, die with a madman's yell in
his ears, die a death such as had never befallen
the leprous negro, in the infernal history of the
Slave Trade!
There was no time to be lost. The thin
line of smoke, issuing through the aperture,
began
to thicken rapidly into a cloud. This
coffin-like room, whose atmosphere was close
and oppressive at all times, began to grow
uncomfortably
warm. The air began to heat.
Lem, my good fellow, the joke has been
carried far enough, as he spoke, in a tone of
good-fellowship, he raised the lamp, with a
firmer hand, and surveyed the face of the
Converted Monk: You know the secret
of the inside spring. Open the door and let
us begone. Once outside and
You will give me a dollar, for
char-i-ty's
sake  won't ye? said Lemuel in a subdued
voice. Hark! These walls are thick, but
you can hear the State House bell. By this
time Reuben, the
wing
of your big mansion is
provided with a plumage of flames. Good
figure that? Hark! Do you hear a sound,
like the tread of a large crowd? Hundreds
of people are in front of your doors, Reuben,
but not one of them  not one among ten
thousand  can release you from this room.
Caleb cast an uneasy glance toward the
aperture. The cloud of smoke was increasing
rapidly. The atmosphere of the Iron Room,
grew warmer every moment. And a deep
roaring sound, like the echo of a vast furnace,
throbbed at intervals, upon the ear of the
affrighted
man.
Let us go! shrieked Caleb, now fairly
wild with terror, as the big drops of moisture
coursed down his hollow cheeks: I swear to
you that I will forget the past. You shall be
rich, rich I say! I will divide my wealth  I
swear it!
He talks of riches and of wealth, who in
less than an hour, will be nothing but a heap
of cindered bones! said Lemuel in a low
voice, as though communing with himself.
Madman I defy you! cried Brother Caleb,
fixing his gaze, with sudden intensity upon the
visage of Lemuel: Why need I beseech,
when with a look I can disarm your madness!
My eye is upon you. You know it. You
cannot move but at my bidding. Ha, ha, have
I mastered you?
Indeed Lemuel shrank from that fixed gaze,
which was imbued with peculiar magnetic
power. He shrank, and turned his body away,
but his eyes he could not remove from Brother
Caleb's face.
Was the mind of Goodleigh about to triumph
over the will of the Madman?
Lemuel seemed to have become in a
moment
,
the victim of an intolerable physical
and mental agony. He trembled violently,
and the foam grew thicker and whiter, over
his lips. Turning his body from side to side,
at pleasure, he could not remove his eyes from
the burning fascination of Caleb's gaze.
Come! Open that door  I command
you! exclaimed Brother Caleb, while his
projecting eyeballs, emitted flames of magnetic
light: You are in my power. I command
you.
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINTH.
A LITTLE PRIVATE CONVERSATION.
Lemuel
began to move along the iron floor,
slowly, almost imperceptibly, and without
raising
his feet. Not for an instant did he remove
his gaze from Caleb's face. He was chained
to Caleb's eyes, as by the power of an
irresistible
magnetism.
To the door! Discover the secret spring!
I command you!
Brother Caleb dared not turn away his eyes
from Lemuel's face. That steady gaze, one
instant changed, and all was lost. But he felt
the air was growing warmer every moment,
and the smoke issuing from the aperture, now
began to flow like a misty veil before his face.
Gliding, shuffling over the floor, Lemuel
approached
the wall, where it was supposed the
secret door was concealed.
His features were terribly agitated; he was
gathering all the force of his Will, in order to
combat the fascination of Goodleigh's gaze.
Halting abruptly, he flung his body backward,
while his feet moved as if in opposition to his
will. And as he struggled with that gaze, as
a man would wrestle with an enemy, arm to
arm and breast to breast, Brother Caleb drew
nearer, until the lamp which he held came
within the reach of Lemuel's uplifted arm.
The face of Caleb was bathed in moisture.
His eyes flashed with a sinister, malignant
lustre
.
You dare not disobey! he said, and
Lemuel's struggling arm, dashed the lamp
from his hand. They were alone in the Iron
Room, alone in the darkness, enveloped in the
stifling atmosphere, as in a shroud of heat and
smoke. The power of Caleb's gaze was
gone; and a burst of mocking laughter
which seemed to resound from the very heart
of Lemuel, told Caleb that the hour of the
madman's vengeance was at hand.
Ha! Ha! This atmosphere grows
comfortably
warm. How do you like it Reuben?
Devil! gasped Caleb through his
grating
teeth.
You can hear the State House bell?
Hark! to the sound of the firemen's tread
as they are hurrying along the street. But
they cannot save you Caleb. No! No!
N-o-o!
Caleb uttered a howl of despair and plunged
in the direction of his enemy's voice, but
Lemuel
slid like a snake from his outstretched
arms.
When I stood upon the threshold, I thought
to myself, that it would be better for me to
obtain
the proofs of your guilt before I had you
arrested. But I changed my mind, Reuben,
changed my mind  d' ye hear? I will not
arrest you; I want no proofs of your guilt. I
only want  another burst of laughter
the opportunity of a little private conversation
with you.
This place stifles me, groaned Caleb
I can scarcely breathe. By Satan it is only
a horrible nightmare. Lemuel! Lemuel!
Relieve me from this place, and name your
price. I am rich  rich
And you must die the death of a leprous
negro in a burning ship, whispered Lemuel
in his ear.
I have riches scattered over all the world.
Release me, and I will share with you! You
have heard of my plantation in the West
Indies
?
A beautiful place that stretches from
the sea-shore, adorned with everything that
can please a man of pleasure. Beautiful slaves
they are mine  cellars filled all with old
wine  a voluptuous atmosphere  days and
nights of sensual pleasure. These  these I
offer you as the price of my life! Quick,
Lemuel, quick, I say! There is no time to
be lost!
You grow poetical, Reuben, was the
only reply that resounded from the darkness:
Strike a more practical vein. Somehow I
like the sound of your voice.
Do you desire money? Long condemned
to poverty, you shall taste the enjoyment of
money for money's sake. You shall become
a Capitalist. You shall have the control of
half my fortune. Think of it Lemuel! As a
man of money, you can revenge the insults
received
in a lifetime of poverty, you can
command
The twenty thousand dollars of which you
robbed me, at
rouge et noir
in the good city
of Paris. Eh, Reuben?
That roaring sound, which throbbed through
the burning mansion, was now heard with
appalling
distinctness. Faster and thicker poured
the smoke through the aperture in the iron
walls. The heat became intolerable. Caleb
groaned in anguish: he heard the sound of
bells and trampling feet, and shouting voices,
all subdued and deadened by thick walls, and
every sound penetrated his heart like his
funeral
knell.
Will no one save me! he shrieked
Must I die in this cursed place?
I burn! I burn! answered the voice of
Lemuel  These iron plates are heating.
Reuben, Reuben I say
You relent  you will discover the secret
spring?
There was silence, only interrupted by that
dull, roaring sound.
Lemuel roused from his monomania by the
near prospect of an appalling death, had indeed
relented. The madness which had seized
him, after his entrance into the iron room, now
suddenly passed away. He started from his
frenzy, like a man roused abruptly from a
horrible
dream.
Search for the spring. Reuben, he cried
in a changed voice  Years ago, the secret
of that spring was communicated to me by
the lock-smith, on his death-bed. In his last
hour, he repented that he had made the lock,
for the death of the burglar weighed heavy on
his soul
The spring! shrieked Caleb, Where is
it? Do you not feel that we are burning
alive?
A small iron knob projects from the iron
panel. It is about half-way between the
ceiling
and the floor.
In the darkness, they began to search for
the iron knob. While the atmosphere grew
more dense, Caleb and Lemuel placed their
hands upon the iron panels, already warming
under the influence of the fire, and with the
eagerness of despair sought for the inside
spring.'
They passed around the narrow room, in
opposite directions, and met again, their hands
pressed upon the iron panel, touching in the
darkness.
I cannot find it, groaned Lemuel  We
shall be burned alive
Dog! This is your work? hissed Caleb
through his set teeth: You will share my
fate. We shall die together. Ho, ho, friend
Lemuel are you caught in your own trap
But I am not
rich
, whispered Lemuel.
Goodleigh mad with rage, sprung toward
him in the darkness. Lemuel avoided his grasp,
and Goodleigh stumbled and fell upon the iron
floor. A sensation of intolerable heat, pervaded
his frame, as he came in contact with the
heated panels.
I would give ten years of my life, to have
you in my grasp, he shrieked, as he staggered
to his feet.
You had better think of your misdeeds,
Reuben, answered Lemuel  Think of
Ann Clarke who was innocent, until you
crossed my path, and made her the Murderess
of her own child
And you, now that you are about to die,
shut up in flames, you my good Lemuel, think
of the Church whose rites you have blasphemed,
whose vows you have broken. Think of that
life of forty years, which is marked in its every
moment, by the tricks of a craven and a
swindler
Think of Alice Bayne! You are silent
have I touched you? Ah, cowardly knave!
Did not your heart fail you, when you stole
into that peaceful home, and under the cloak
of your profession, damned the purity of a
mother, drove the father to suicide, and sent
the children adrift upon the world? Did you
ever feel remorse good Reuben?
I did not creep to the bed of a dying
woman
,
and under the cloak of a Preacher's
frock, extort from her fears a will that made
her children beggars. Indeed I did not. That
was reserved for a `
Converted Monk
.'
But you robbed this Preacher of the
inheritance
of the children  robbed him at the
gambling table  at the very moment, when
he was about to return to America, and
surrender
his ill-gotten wealth. Do you
remember
Frascati's?
Is there no way of escape? groaned
Caleb
in a changed voice. Ah! This is a
horrible
death!
He gasped for breath, and staggered over the
floor, while his temples throbbed with an
intolerable
torture. The roaring sound grew
more distinct. It drowned the tramp of the
thousands who hurried along the street, and
enveloped the iron room on every side.
Panting for breath, his lungs oppressed by
the stifling air, the sinews of his throat
writhing
under a sense of suffocation, his brain
fevered
and his temples throbbing with acute
agony, Brother Caleb felt that his
consciousness
was rapidly passing away, that he was
sinking fast into that stupor which terminates
only in Eternity.
He began to utter incoherent oaths and
imprecations
of despair, as he staggered over the
heated floor.
Alice! I defy you! You shall not drag
me down! A ship in sight, did you say?
Ho, ho, we'll foil them! Into the sea with
our living cargo  overboard with them all!
Wash the stain of blood from the decks, and
let hand-cuff and manacle follow the negroes,
into the sea. For the sea is silent  it tells
no tales! How much did you say I was
worth? Half a million? A great deal of
money! Change it into gold, gold, d'ye hear?
Let me see it all in gold. Let me bathe in it,
let me swim in it, for with gold a man can
move the world. Curses upon the knaves!
This gold is heated  it withers the flesh from
my fingers as I grasp it!
Staggering to and fro, Brother Caleb at last,
encountered the form of Lemuel.
Lemuel was on his knees, muttering as he
gasped for breath, a prayer of the Catholic
Church.
They grappled together, and fought in the
darkness, Caleb endeavoring to dash the head
of Lemuel against the heated wall, while
Lemuel
clinging to him, with maniac strength,
sunk his teeth into Caleb's shoulder.
Their curses died half-uttered on their lips.
Suffocating with the intolerable heat, they lost
the power and coherence of audible speech.
It was a fearful struggle which they
maintained
in the darkness, in that Iron Room,
enveloped in a whirlpool of flame.
CHAPTER THIRTIETH.
THE BRAVERY OF THE PREACHER.
Our narrative once more retraces its steps,
and resumes the adventures of the other
characters
of this history.
They're bringin' a ladder! Look! Look!
They're bringin' a ladder! Don't you see
'em!
Wild with fright, the Preacher bent from the
window. Reaching forth his arms he surveyed
the thousand faces which were upraised in the
glare of the blazing house.
Fanny by his side, in her gay attire, with
her hands joined and her black hair floating
over his shoulders, fixed her gaze upon a single
form in the crowd, whom her eye singled out
among a thousand.
Poor Ralph! While the engines worked
by sturdy arms were playing upon the roof,
while the smoke and flame rolling into the sky
together, alternately illumined and darkened
the scene, he stood on the edge of the
pavement
half naked and barefoot, with his eyes
raised to the window in the third story.
He had secured a plug for the Fairy, and
now leaving the Fairy Boys to work the
engine, he leaned against a tree-box and made
his voice heard above the clamor of the crowd:
Durn my riggin! There's a gal up yander!
A live gal! Why don't you fetch a ladder!
And a man too! Moses!  how he shakes
his neck and wriggles his hands!
Presently a ladder was brought, and after
much hoarse shouting and rugged motion, it
was raised and placed against the window in
the third story.
Save the gal! shouted twenty rough
voices, and twenty fellows in scarlet shirts
leaped to the ladder with one bound.
But Ralph was before them. No sooner
had the top of the ladder touched the window
sill than his naked feet were upon its rounds,
and his hardy visage lifted upward, and
reddened
by the glare, gazed with its large grey
eyes, upon the face of the woman far above,
as he ascended with the agility of a monkey
in search of cocoa-nuts.
Go it Jonesey! shouted a score of voices
Save the gal or bust yer b'iler!
Fanny gazing from the window beheld her
brother's face as he rapidly ascended. Peter
when he left the room, had closed the door
whether by design or accident we cannot tell
and for a while, the place was free from
smoke, although the flames from the wing of
the mansion, were every instant rolling nearer
to the main building. She breathed freely,
but the uproar, the sky reddened with flame,
the echo of falling timber, and the shouts from
the thronged street, filled her with a terror
that can be readily imagined.
But Ralph was coming  he was half way
up the ladder  he would save her. Fanny
uttered a loud shriek of joy.
The Preacher darting into the shadows,
secured some articles which he took from his
trunk within his white vest, and placed the
MSS. of his life, entitled
Memoirs of a
Preacher
, in the pocket of his dressing
gown. Darting to the light again, insane with
terror and incapable of thinking of anything
but the safety of his precious life, he began to
creep from the window. His feet touched the
rounds of the ladder. Turning his face,
distorted
by his panic, over his shoulder he began
to descend.
You are not going to leave me? cried
Fanny.
He did not seem to hear her; but a thousand
eyes uplifted from the street, beheld this
illustration
of his gallantry and courage. Beheld
the Preacher descending, while the face of the
girl looked from the window.
But Ralph was rapidly ascending. In a
moment after the Preacher left the window
Ralph's hand encountered his right foot.
Go back you cuss, he shouted, pinching
the Preacher in the calf of his leg  Into the
winder agin, or I'll chuck you overboard.
Don't! Don't! cried Jervis  Let me
go. The house is on fire
O' cou'se it is answered Ralph,
converting
his head into a battering ram, and urging
the Preacher upward again  Keep movin'
my superfine feller! My name's Jonesey and
I al'ays goes in for burnin' a chap like you,
into small pieces. Will you get into the
winder
or shall I chuck you over?
The Preacher looked below  his fears
increased
the distance between himself and the
pavement  he began to grow dizzy.
But Ralph, conscious that the eyes of the
Fairy Boys were upon him, propelled the
Preacher gently upward, by using his head as
a battering ram, and the Preacher's delicate
person as the object of attack.
Comprehending
this manoeuvre, you will not be surpised to
learn, that the Preacher soon reached the
window
,
and entered it again by a movement which
would have gained him great applause in any
respectable Circus. To be brief, he plunged
head
under
heels into the window.
Hello! What's this! cried Ralph as he
reached the top of the ladder and found
himself
face to face with his sister  May I be
turned into a Snapper if you don't look like
our
Fan!
It is Fan, yes it is Ralph, answered the
girl flinging her arms about her brother's neck
O, I am so glad you're come!
Don't doubt it! But what do you mean
dressin' yerself like a play-actor? cried
Ralph gazing with big eyes at the changed
attire
of his sister  Have you found any rich
relations, an' did they set their house a-fire,
for joy, at seein' you?
But Fanny with a firm hand and courageous
heart, had already ascended upon the window
sill, and placed one foot upon the ladder. She
was a brave girl. Her life of neglect and
want had given her presence of mind and
firmness
of nerve.
Go down, Ralph, she said, when we
are safe I'll tell you all. Go down  I can
take care of myself  only do you keep my
frock from blowing in the wind.
You look like a rale super at the theater,
cried Ralph, beginning his descent, as with
one hand placed upon his sister's dress, he
steadied her movements: Don't look below,
Fan, and we're safe!
The wind lifted the masses of her dark hair,
and the glare of the flame, showed her form,
in distinct relief, as assisted by her vagabond
brother, she slowly descended the ladder.
Take kear Jonesey! shouted a Fairy
Boy from below.
And the spectators of the conflagration, held
their breath with suspense, as they beheld the
form of the girl, descending the ladder, her
rich attire contrasted strongly with the ragged
apparel of the outcast Ralph.
Fanny was half way down the ladder before
the Preacher recovered from his acrobatic
movement through the window. Gathering
himself up again, he placed his hands upon
the sill, and beheld the face of Fanny uplifted,
with the reflection of the fire, giving a wilder
beauty to every feature.
I must not loose the girl, he murmured,
and crawled out upon the window sill, when
a strong arm, dragged him back again.
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIRST.
STEWEL HAS HOPES OF THE TIN BOX.
Peter stood before him, holding the form of
an insensible man in his arms. Peter rushing
from the smoke and flames of the entry, had
closed the door again, and dragged his burden
toward the window.
It's Lester, faltered the Preacher, as he
beheld
the pallid face of the insensible man.
To be sure it is, an' I found him thar in
the smoke! An' when I found him he wanted
to jump down the stairs into the fire, and so I
had to knock him, jist to bring him to reason.
Arter us is manners!
Throwing the form of the insensible Lester
over his shoulders, he emerged from the window,
and began to descend the ladder.
You are not going to leave me? shrieked
the Preacher, I tell you I can't get down
myself
,
I'm sick  I haven't strength. The fire
has reached the entry  I'll be burned alive
What's the odds! shouted Peter, lifting
his ruddy visage toward the affrighted man,
who projected his head from the window
If you can't use your hands an' feet you'll
have
to burn.
The Preacher, whose terrors, long agitated
by glimpses of hope, now left him trembling
and powerless, leaned against the window, his
teeth chattering and his hands shaking as they
grasped the sill.
I can't get down, I tell you I c-a-n-t! he
shrieked.
Peter with his insensible burden on his
shoulders, was now on a level with the second
story.
At the same moment, Fanny and Ralph had
reached the pavement, amid the cheers of the
spectators.
Wait a minnit and I'll come up for you!
cried Peter, You deserve a good burnin' but
I'll let that be postponed to a futur' occasion!
Quick! Quick! I hear the fire in the
entry! and as his voice was borne away by
the wind, the spectators beheld his pallid face
and outstretched arms.
For two or three minutes the wretched man
endured all the tortures of a thousand deaths.
He heard the roaring of the flame, as it swept
from the wing to the main edifice of the man
sion  he felt the heat which despite the open
window, was fast becoming insupportable
and it seemed to his craven soul, that his heart
as it knocked against his ribs, was only the
sound of a death-watch, announcing his
approaching
hour.
He's nearly down the ladder! Why don't
he hurry? It's horrible  burned alive, burned
alive and at my age! He means to leave me
here  I know it, I know it! Curse me,
why have not I strength to descend the ladder
myself? Hah! He's down, he's down!
He's giving Lester into the arms of those
men, and there's the girl, too  all safe, all
safe! And I'm up here, burning alive
The eyes of the wretched man fairly started
from their sockets. Grasping the window,
with both hands, he bent forward, and traversed
the extent of the ladder with a madman's
gaze.
He's coming, he's coming? screamed
the Preacher, as he caught a glimpse of the
scarlet coat  Quick! Quick! If I once
get out o' this I'll be a better man, indeed I
will!
Peter is indeed upon the ladder once more
Peter is ascending rapidly  and Peter reaches
the window, at the same moment that the fire
bursts from the roof above, in one vivid and
dazzling sheet of flame.
Come! and the Preacher reached forth
both arms.
Peter seized him, as though he had been a
bundle of goods.
Be quiet and don't kick or I'll drap you
he whispered, as he slowly descended.
At this moment, the pipe of the Fairy
directed
towards the roof, poured in one steady
column full upon the head of the Preacher.
In an instant he was saturated from head to
foot.
Murder! he shouted, scarce knowing
what to make of this last calamity  Fire!
Be quiet, can't you, whispered Peter,
and as he spoke the flames rushed in a torrent
from the third story window. Look
thar!
Raising his dripping face, the Preacher
beheld
the sheeted mass, and was blinded even
as he gazed, by a sudden cloud of smoke,
which whirled along the front of this mansion,
burying himself and Peter in its folds.
Hold me tight, he gasped in agony
11
Don't let me drop! If I'm safe out o' this,
I'll be a better man!
O, you will? growled Peter I reckon
so! Till you run off with somebody's wife
or murder somebody's darter? Hey?
In a few moments, half dead with affright,
wet to the skin, and shivering in every nerve,
the Preacher was placed upon his feet, at the
foot of the ladder. The instant that his feet
touched the ground, he seemed to recover his
presence of mind. Gazing around the crowd,
he beheld the ragged Ralph standing beside
his sister, near the foot of the ladder, while
Lester was in the arms of a stout citizen who
was endeavoring to restore him to
consciousness
by dashing water into his face. And as
he looked around, Fanny rushed eagerly
toward
him, holding Ralph by the hand, while
the giant Peter turned to the insensible Lester,
and assisted the stout citizen in the effort to
restore him from his death-like swoon.
This is Ralph  this is my brother, said
Fanny.
A deep bass voice resounding from the very
foot of the ladder, for a moment drew the
attention of the spectators from the face of the
beautiful girl.
Gentlemen! This is a free country, said
the deep bass voice, and the portly form of
Stewel Pydgeon was revealed by the torch
light  An' I don't hold it to be the correct
thing, to let a man burn to death in a free
country.
Where's any body burnin' to death?
cried a Fireman, who was busy at a fire-plug
which stood in front of the burning mansion
Where is he? Say? Don't you see we're
gettin' the fire under, old hoss? There's more
chance o' yer friend bein' drowned than burnt
by a long chalk.
He's in that house, an' he's my friend,
cried Stewel, in great excitement  An' I've
got a warrant for him in my pocket! I should
like to know if the ends o' justice are to be
evaded in this way? A man goin' and burnin'
hisself to death when I've got a warrant in my
pocket for him?
Singular to relate, these words of Stewel,
pronounced with much eloquence of gesture
and an emphasis of the deepest bass, only
elicited a roar of laughter from the surrounding
crowd.
I say Stewel, I'd get a
habe's corpus
on
him, suggested the fireman at the plug
That'll fetch him sure!
But a new object of interest had attracted
Stewel's gaze. He beheld the Preacher in his
dressing gown, with Fanny on one side, and
the half-naked Outcast on the other.
Goodleigh's gone  but the tin box is
sure! cried Stewel, grasping Ralph by the
collar. Come along Jonesey  that tin box
my dear!
And Ralph who had been listening to the
whispered words of the Preacher, started as if
he had been aroused in the midst of a dream,
and found himself in the hands of Stewel
Pydgeon.
What has my brother done to you?
cried Fanny.
Why do you seize the young man by the
throat? exclaimed the Preacher laying his
hand on Stewel's arm.
What's that your business? I say my
buck you'll have to come along. The tin box
is safe if Goodleigh has gone and burnt
hisself
to death.
He tightened his grasp upon the collar of
the young man, and began to drag him roughly
along the pavement.
Ralph at first thunderstricken by the
apparition
of Stewel, now regarded him steadily,
surveying his rubicund face with flashing
eyes.
Jist let go a-me, he said  Or I'll be
apt to raise the Fairy on you.
As he said this, Lester stretched in the arms
of Peter, at the foot of the tree-box, unclosed
his eyes. He beheld with the first glance of
consciousness, the face of Fanny and the
visage
of the Preacher. At the sight, the blood
coursed through his veins once more. He
sprang from the arms of Caleb and rushed
toward
the Preacher.
Fairy boys to yer work, to yer work I
say!  cried Ralph, and Stewel under the
influence
of a clenched fist, which Ralph had
planted between his eyes, fell back upon
Lester
,
and Lester unprepared for this shock, fell
once more into the arms of Peter.
You're a fugitive from justice! shouted
Stewel, as soon as he recovered himself.
Gentlemen I call upon you to assist me in
arrestin' this desperate villain!
He looked around for Ralph, but Ralph had
disappeared.
It is Jervis, whispered Lester as he
released
himself from the arms of Peter, Jervis
and the daughter of Alice Bayne.
Rushing by the portly form of Stewel,
Lester
looked eagerly around in search of the
Preacher and the girl, but Jervis and Fanny
had also disappeared.
Lester and Stewel formed the centre of a
compact group, who regarded their movements
with a burst of laughter.
He shall not escape me! shouted Lester,
as the light streamed on his uncovered
head and colorless visage, I will pursue him
to the end of the earth
He attempted to force his way through the
crowd, but the crowd presenting a compact
front, forced him back upon the portly form of
the Police Officer:
This is an attempt to resist the Law!
shouted Stewel in a rage  I know you
gentlemen! I've got all your names! You
may laugh, but to-morrow, Judge Choktaw
'ill hear o' this
The crowd seemed to be impressed with
the idea that Lester and Stewel were alike
functionaries of the law, and therefore they
resisted
all their attempts to pursue the
fugitives
.
Peter came quietly to Lester's side
but at this moment, a scene took place, which
entirely changed the surface of affairs.
CHAPTER THIRTY-SECOND.
A FIREMAN'S FIGHT.
A fight! A fight! resounded from the
opposite
side of the street, and in a moment the
engines ceased to play, while the glare of the
burning house revealed the faces of a dense
crowd, tossed to and fro, in inextricable
confusion
.
It was a Fireman's fight.
Before we gaze upon the features of this
exciting scene, let us lightly sketch a few
prominent characteristics of the Philadelphia
Fireman.
A mysterious character is the Fireman of
the Quaker City. At the sound of the Bell,
he starts from his slumber, and hurries forth
but half clad, eager to battle with the flames,
and save the property of the rich man from
destruction. He calls no hour of the
twenty-four
his own. He has no hearing but for the
sound of the fire-bell. His only idea ef
motion
is an engine or hose carriage, hurled along
the streets, by the impulse of vigorous arms.
Music to him is only found in the brass horn,
through which the voice of the engineer rings in
hoarse emphasis, exclaiming Give way!
Let her drive! or Wake up Snappers!
or Here we are Hornets! or some
expression
of similar eloquence and rough Saxon
energy. Happy is the Fireman who carries
the horn! The Horn is the climax of your
incipient fireman's idea of glory. To carry
the Horn in the thought of the Fireman, is
as important and as glorious, as twenty-five
per cent in good paper, is to the Third Street
Broker.
The Engine or Hose Carriage is the centre
of all the fireman's thoughts. He lives in the
life of the machine  a new-fangled term
lately introduced from New York, and not
recognized
by Orthodox Firemen. Her
frontis-piece
,
the amount of polish of which her brass is
capable, the height which she plays, and the
speed with which she runs  these are the
only topics which occupy the attention of the
true Fireman.
The soldier goes to battle in a gay uniform,
and faces death for pay or for glory. The
Fireman battles with flames, with falling
rafters, with the chances of disease, and very
often the certainty of an untimely death, and
battles always without pay, very often without
a word of thanks. His only glory is in action;
he seems to be possessed with a monomania
that forces him to devote time, health, strength
very often life  to the good of other
people
,
who too often call him a ruffian and
a blackguard, by way of recompense.
The Knights of old were divided into
classes, ranks, and orders. So are the Modern
Knights: the Firemen of the Quaker City.
There is the Fireman Dandy who sports
white kids on Chesnut street, and yet is always
ready to tear them off at the first tap of the
State House Bell. This Fireman belongs to
an aristocratic company, composed of staid
citizens and gentlemen of the counting-house.
They have a great supper once a year, and
rather pride themselves upon their elegant
equipments, the long established name of their
company, the respectable standing of their
members, to say nothing of the neat little back
room in their Engine House, where no cigar
is smoked that does not breathe Havana in
every puff.
Then there is the Fireman Hero who
delights
in the poetry of epithet, and always has
a feud on hand, with some rival company.
The very manner in which he dresses has
something formidable to the unsuspecting.
Hair very short behind the ears, and very long
and shiny before them; hat with wide round
rim, pitched significantly on one side of the
head, and brought down very sharply upon
one eyebrow; shirt of red flannel, adorned
with a broach of the size of a dollar,
representing
some event in the Fireman's life, or
perchance the figure of a horn done in silver,
or yet again merely the initials of his
company's
name.
Like the Knights of old, the Fireman Hero
affects the poetry of epithet. True he does
not call himself the Knight of the Burning
Brand, or the Knight of the Silver Fountain,
nor even the Knight of the Golden Horn.
His titles have a vigorous old-fashioned Saxon
significancy. He is a Snapper, or a Hornet,
or a Tartar  or in his more dangerous moods
a Fairy. A Fairy six feet high, in a white
overcoat trimmed with horn buttons, and with
corduroy pantaloons inserted into the tops of
unpolished boots, would be something of a
novelty to the minds of those ignorant persons,
who have derived their ideas of Fairies, and
Fairy life, from books. There are also the
Rancheroes of the great Firemen army, who
skulking on the outskirts of the camp, take to
themselves such fearful names as Bouncers,
Rats, Killers, Screw-Drivers and Blue Injins.
These do not belong to the army of Firemen
any more than the camp followers belong to
an army of disciplined soldiers. They are
the real
guerrilereroes
of the Fire Department.
Terrible are they with brick-bats on a Sunday
afternoon: formidable are they, with paving
stones, on a dark night, when the number of
the enemy, is as one to twenty. Fearful are
they in noises  noises of all kinds  very
hoarse always  and sometimes very drunken.
They practice the Indian war-whoop in their
leisure hours. They prepare themselves for
the arduous work of battle, by a severe
training
around piles of brick, and heaps of paving
stones. They are eloquent swearers. The
number of times, when they confirm their
statement, by invoking fierce condemnation,
upon their eyes and livers, cannot be estimated
by any known Arithmetic.
The true Firemen looks upon these
Rancheroes
with especial disfavour. As the
Newfoundland
Dog endures much from an ill-grained
Cur, with defective eyes and scanty tail, so
the real Firemen suffers much and suffers in
silence, from the annoyances of the Ranchero.
But as the Newfoundland dog sometimes drops
his senerity, and seizes the cur by the neck,
and shakes him at first gently, and then with
justifiable violence, so the real Firemen, at
times, is tempted to tap the Ranchero with his
closed hand, and even to adorn the Ranchero's
eyes with touches of a rich mezzotinto shadow.
To do the real Firemen the most scanty
justice, we must record the fact, that he does
more work for less pay, braves death oftener
for less glory, than any other member of the
the community. Your shrewd money-making
citizen, who never does a favor without a
direct return in the shape of coin, looks upon
the Fireman with an overflowing fullness of
contempt. Very often he rewards the Fireman
by insinuating in conversation or in the papers,
that he only extinguishes flames which he
himself has created. He rewards the Fireman
for his thankless sacrifice of self by calling him
an Incendiary. A just man and a grateful, is
your sagacious citizen.
Battles have often been described, that is
battles fought with cannon and bayonet, but
what pen shall dare attempt the description of
a Fireman's Fight?
The time midnight, or very often the small
hours, near the break of day. The combatants
some six hundred men, blocked up amid a mass
of spectators, whose faces are reddened by the
light of a blazing house. The weapons, fists,
horns, spanners, bricks, clubs, and paving
stones. The cause  a hose has been
discourteously
trodden upon, or a plug has been
taken away, or a Snapper in the heat of
debate
has spoken irreverently of a Hornet.
Then the war-cry resounds along the crowded
street. Then, over dripping paving stones,
and around glittering engines, and along
sidewalks
slippery with mire, swells the tide of
war. You see a mass of heads, arms, fists,
horns, feet and bodies, wind into a knot, and
unwind again, to the sound of Go it
Snappers
!
and Ha-a! Ha-a! Tartars! The
air, by turns, darkened with cinders and red
with the glare of blazing roofs, grows thick
with brick-bats and paving stones, all on the
wing, and doing fierce work, on eyes and
crowns. The wounded fall, only to rise in
more savage wrath. The fight grows
miscellaneous
:
anybody can procure a broken head,
without the least trouble. All along the
curbstones
,
droop weary warriors with bended heads
and bleeding noses. The uninitiated who
desire
a definite idea of a scene like this, have
only to remember that fine old Legend of the
Cats of Kilkenny, or to imagine the Halls
of Congress on the last night of the session.
A faint idea may be obtained in this way.
A battle like this, was now in progress, in
front of the burning mansion. How this fight
originated, after a careful search into the most
recondite branches of history, we are unable
distinctly to relate. But certain it is, that just
as the fire was beginning to yield to the
combined
attacks of half a dozen engines, in front
of the mansion, and four in the rear, that the
war-cry rose, and the combat began. In a
moment hose and engine pipes were dropped.
The crowd began to roll and toss, in a huge
wave of heads and arms. Little knots of
firemen
were fighting along the curbstone, while in
the centre of the street, swelled the
concentrated
fury of the war. Then through the
uproar
might be heard the war-shouts of the rival
clans. Wake her up Snappers! was answered
by Hey! Hornets! hey! Go it Fairies!
was mingled with Now's your time Tartars!
and Let 'em have it Injins! was greeted by
the stern response, To your duty Rats!
Horns were freely used. Brick-bats began
to hurtle through the stormy air. Along the
extent of an entire square, rolled the tide of
battle, mingling the combatants and spectators,
into one inextricable mass of heads and fists,
over which distinctly rose the figures of the
engines, glittering in the flame, like islands in
a stormy sea.
Stewel Pydgeon, Charles Lester and the
giant Peter, collected in a group, in front of
the burning house, surveyed the field of
battle
,
with various emotions.
Gen'elmen respect the law, cried Stewel,
in a voice of thunder  but alas! a blow from
some unknown fist, which shot suddenly
around the corner of the tree-box, brought
Stewel to his knees. And a second blow,
administered
freely on the back of the neck,
made Stewel kiss the bricks. Thus was the
Law, brought to shame, in the person of
one of its most respectable Ministers.
Peter, in his red coat, surveyed the scene,
not precisely with eyes like saucers, but
with eyes very large, and very full of vague
astonishment.
What air they fightin' about? How they
rap one another! They're they go! Why
don't they stand up two by two and fight it
out like men, instead o' mixin' 'emselves up
like a basket o' black cats?
Come  let us make our way through
the crowd, cried Lester seizing Peter's arm:
The Preacher disappeared in this direction.
Come, I say. Unless we pursue him now,
he will escape us altogether.
Peter did not remark the pallid cheek and
flashing eye of his young friend.
Peter, gazing into the centre of the
combat
,
beheld a solitary man, fighting alone,
against a crowd of twenty. Dressed in a red
shirt, with the blood flowing freely from his
battered face, this lonely warrior, was
attempting
to defend his engine, from the assault of
twenty foes. His brothers in arms were
fighting
in another part of the contest. By the
chance of war, he was left alone, near the
Engine
of his company, which the twenty had
resolved to deface if not destroy. But he kept
up the fight right heartily.
Tell yer I'm one of de Fairy boys, he
shouted as he fought through his foes  Yer
don't smash dis engine. No yer don't. I
keeps a graveyard of my own, jist to bury
my dead. I keeps two Coroners and a depitty
busy all the year round. Go it Fairy! You
never know'd I was brought up to the business
did yer?
Tossing into the crowd of his enemies, the
Fairy distributed his blows with a high-toned
impartiality, that soon littered the paving stones,
with wounded and bleeding warriors. Five of
the enemy measured their length upon the
ground. But others rallied. Adding new fire
to their fury, by frequent shouts, they rushed
upon the solitary Fairy, and bore him upon
his knees. He, fighting as he fell, continued
to converse with his tongue and fists.
I'm a Fairy  I am! he shouted gallantly
as a hail-storm of fists, descended upon his
unprotected
head.
At this crisis Peter beheld the scene. And
Peter, with a bound reached the centre of the
fray, and interposed his giant form, arrayed in
the scarlet overcoat, between the Fairy and his
ensanguined foes.
You mus'nt crowd. It ain't perlite.
Besides
I never like to see twenty wolves upon
one dog.
CHAPTER THIRTY-THIRD.
PETER BECOMES A FAIRY.
With these words expressed without the
least appearance of heat, Peter raised his
right arm, and showed his right hand, high
over the heads of the combatants.
Jist strike this man agin, he cried, and
you'll find me
thar!
Surprised for a moment by this apparition,
the combatants presently recovered their
presence
of mind.
Go way old man, this is a private fight
Sarve him out! Give a horn over his
top-knot
Hey! Hey! Down with him, down with
'em both
He's a Fairy  let him have it
And accordingly one of the combatants,
struck Peter in the breast, just as the solitary
Fairy, protected for a moment by his
intervention
,
was rising from his knees.
`Come, children you better go home and
let your mammies spank you and put you to
bed.
With these paternal remarks, Peter
described
a circle with his right hand, followed
by a circle with his left, at the same time
projecting
his right foot with sudden and rapid
force.
Lord! how the old hoss mows 'em down!
ejaculated the admiring Fairy.
It was indeed true. Peter in sober verity
had mowed 'em down. He went through
them, with great composure, using his hands
and feet at the same instant, and littering
the ground with the forms of the Fairy's
enemies. Two alone resisted his progress,
making desperate battle, over the heaps of
their wounded comrades, but Peter seized
them by the neck, and knocked their heads
together, until they dropt like ripe apples to the
ground.
Where did you larn it, hoss? cried the
admiring Fairy, seizing Peter's hand  Jist
larn me how to mow  do.
But there was not much time for
conversation
.
The battle which had been raging in the
middle of the street, now rolled toward the
sidewalk, and entangled Peter and the Fairy
boy in its vortex. Fifty other Fairies were
battling with as many of Crocodiles. They
fought around the Engine, and Peter much
against his will, was forced to strike right and
left, in order to save himself from being
trampled
under foot. Soon the Rats, the Bouncers,
the Blue Injins, and the Snappers, joined the
fray, and the Hornets came hurrying to the
ranks of war. It was no longer a fight of
feuds, a war of clans, but a promiscuous battle,
in which every one struck his neighbor without
regard to party or creed. Peter mingled
in the broil, and fought like a buffalo at bay.
Charles Lester, gazing from the sidewalk
beheld the scene, as an hundred faces
streaming
blood were illuminated by the glare of the
burning house. Soon he lost sight of Peter.
He then made his way as best he might in
the direction taken by the Preacher and the
girl.
The day was breaking, and the fight was
raging, when a sound like the thunder of an
hundred cannon, drowned the yells of the
combatants, and made every one start, as
though a magazine of gunpowder had exploded
near his feet.
The cause of this sound merits an
explanation
.
While the fight was in progress, the fire,
which had been slowly yielding to the force
of the engines, blazed up with increased vigor.
One by one, the windows of the mansion, from
the second story to the roof gave out a torrent
of flame. The roof itself was one mass of
fire  fire that shot up into the canopy of
smoke in long and tremulous flames. The
western wing of the mansion was on fire from
foundation to roof, and the wind swept the
flames to the main building with the force and
thunder of a tropical hurricane.
Far over the city flashed the light of the
burning mansion, far over the wilderness of
roofs and the waters of the Delaware, spread
that vast volume of smoke, reddened in every
fold, until it resembled an immense pall tinged
with blood.
And the State House Bell never ceased to
strike. Toll, toll, toll  it rung as though it
was pealing a funeral knell.
The battle in the street, and the flames of
Brother Caleb's house, raged together. The
startled denizens of Drab Row, alarmed for
their safety, were projecting their heads from
every window, and from the houses
immediately
adjoining Goodleigh's, crowds of half
clad men and women, and heaps of costly
furniture
,
began to stream in an unceasing torrent.
And the fire burning fiercely on, had long
enveloped the Iron Room in a shroud of flame.
At last the timbers beneath the Iron Room
gave way, and the huge mass plunged with a
horrible crash into the depths of the fiery
whirlpool
.
As it fell, crashing from floor to floor,
the fire was suddenly darkened. A volume of
inky smoke rose from the depths of the
mansion
,
and then the sky was strown with
countless
sparks, glittering through the darkness
like a meteoric shower.
It was the fall of the Iron Room, which had
produced the sound resembling the combined
thunder of an hundred cannon. It was the
darkness which followed this awful sound, that
brought the combatants to a pause, and sent a
thrill through the nerves of a thousand
infuriated
men.
The Iron Room had fallen.
Where now is Goodleigh and the Converted
Monk?
The darkness did not last long. The flames
rushed once more into the sky, as though the
fall of the Iron Room had only deadened their
fury for a moment. The street was once
more bright as noonday. It was no longer
Goodleigh's house that was threatened, but the
mansions of the entire square.
A voice was heard through the death-like
stillness, which had descended upon the
crowded street.
Giant Peter mounted upon the Fairy
engine, with the marks of the late combat on
his face, seized a trumpet and made himself
heard along the entire square:
Put out the fire, boys, he shouted, An
let's fight arterwards.
The suggestion was received with cheers.
In a moment engines and firemen were at their
work again. Separate columns of water were
playing upon the roofs of Drab Row.
Mounting
to the roofs, nine sturdy firemen, with hose
pipes in their hands, poured as many torrents
into the abyss of Goodleigh's house.
Snappers
,
Hornets, Crocodiles, Bouncers, Blue
Injins and Tartars, buried their feuds for awhile,
and with all might of fire-plugs and engines,
went to work sturdily to accomplish the
salvation
of Drab Row.
And Peter, high on the Fairy Engine, was
working with the Fairies, his giant form rising
and bending, as he continued to encourage them
with the oft-repeated remark
Put out the fire boys, an' arterwards we
can lick one another like blazes
When the sun arose, Drab Row was saved.
But Goodleigh's house was a mass of blackened
ruins. The walls alone remained, begrimed
with smoke and dripping with water. Floors,
windows, doors, everything but the brick walls
had been consumed by the flames.
And buried beneath masses of smouldering
timber, the Iron Room, rested in the depths of
the cellar, its panels still joined together, but
heated red hot by the surrounding fire.
Descending from the Fairy as the sun
shone over his scarred and blackened face,
Peter cast his eyes over the crowd, who
thronged the sidewalk, blackened with cinders,
and piled with heaps of damaged and broken
furniture:
Where's Lester? he ejaculated aloud.
Where's Goodleigh? cried a stout
gentleman
near his side: That's the question.
It was Stewel Pydgeon, who stood on the
curbstone, gazing toward the walls of the house,
whose desolate windows, still gave passage to
clouds of inky smoke.
What do I know of Goodleigh? answered
Peter, surveying the Police officer, with a
vague stare.
`Don't be affronted Sir, replied Stewel
with a saddened air  I had a warrant for
him, but he's gone and burnt hisself to death,
in that cussed house. That's all. But I have
some feelin's and a thing like this never
happened
to me afore.
It was not until the close of the day, that
the fire which smouldered in the depths of the
ruined mansion, yielded to the combined force
of a half a dozen engines.
Stewel, anxious to discover some trace of
Goodleigh, hovered all day, near the blackened
walls. More than once he determined to
descend
into the cellar, and search among the
smouldering timbers for the body of Goodleigh.
Of course no idea of Goodleigh's wealth
buried in the ruins ever entered Stewel's
brain.
CHAPTER THIRTY-FOURTH.
A BLUE PARTY.
Peter sought for Lester, and found him
in his room, No. 92 of the  Hotel.
Stretched upon his bed, he raved with a
madman's
look and voice, about the Preacher, the
daughter of Alice Bayne, and his dead sister
Ellen Lester.
For two weeks Peter watched by his
bedside
.
Everyday came the Millerite Preacher,
eager to watch and pray with the sick man.
Charles at length began to recover from the
delirium and fever. Very pale and weak, he
besought William Marvin to watch by his bed,
while Peter hurried forth to gain some
intelligence
of the Preacher. Peter searched the
city through, tried every means within the
reach of mortal man, yet still no word of the
Preacher reached his ears. He had
disappeared
.
He had not been seen since the
night of the fire. Had the daughter of Alice
Bayne, gone with him? Was she in his
charge?
The second day after the fire there was a
funeral in Bonus Court. A rude hearse,
containing
a pine coffin, moved slowly through
the city, followed by the Millerite Preacher
and his daughter. It paused on a bleak
common
,
near the Eastern Penitentiary, and in
front of an unpainted fence, which separated a
space of barren earth some two acres in extent,
from the surrounding waste.
The hearse passed through a gate, and
entered the space surrounded by the rough
fence, and halted again beside a new made
grave. Then William Marvin and the driver
lifted the pine coffin and lowered it into the
grave. The driver shoveled the earth upon it,
while the Millerite on his knees, with Hannah
by his side, uttered a prayer.
That was the manner of the funeral of Ann
Clarke, who was buried in Potter's field.
The second day after the fire, Stewel
Pydgeon
was lounging near the Railroad Depot,
at the corner of Eleventh and Market streets.
He was anxious to gain some intelligence of
Goodleigh. Thinking that he had escaped the
fire, and might make an attempt to leave the
city, Stewel watched for him at the Railroad
Depot.
While his eyes were fixed upon the
aperture
where tickets are sold, an aged man with
long white hair approached, and bought tickets
for himself and two boys, who, attired in blue
cloth round-a-bouts, walked by his side. These
boys were somewhat contrasted, in the details
of their personal appearance. One was slight
and slender; the other bony and rugged.
Both were attired in round-jackets and
pantaloons
of blue cloth, and both wore cloth caps,
of the same color. The aged man, attired
neatly in a blue overcoat, carried a bundle
under his arm; a bundle, which, resembling a
large book, was covered with a scarlet
handkerchief
.
Stewel watched the three, as they left the
ticket office and entered the cars. The place
where he stood was dark, even in daytime,
and he could not see their faces with much
distinctness, but their attire seemed to please
him exceedingly
A
blue
party! he exclaimed  and
laughed at his own joke  after the manner of
police officers  They look as if they been
dipped in indigo.
With this joke  or apology for a joke
the incident passed from Stewel's mind. He
suffered the old man and his two boys to enter
the cars, and go on their journey to Baltimore,
without a word.
And yet the old man was our friend, the
Popular Preacher.
And the tallest of the boys was Ralph Jones,
otherwise called Jonesey the B'iler.
The other boy was Fanny, the sister of
Ralph.
And the bundle, which looked like a large
book, was the TIN BOX, which Ralph had
concealed
beneath the roof of Girard College.
And yet Stewel, standing near the ticket
office, watching for Goodleigh, looked upon
these three figures, dressed in blue, without a
suspicious thought.
Alas! for Stewel! While he watched for
Goodleigh, the TIN BOX slipped by him, and
passed on to Baltimore without an opposing
word.
CHAPTER THIRTY-FIFTH.
THE LAST OF ISRAEL BONUS.
And while two days wore on, much wonder
was felt and expressed in Bonus Court. Rent
Day had come and gone, and Israel Bonus had
not appeared to collect his rents!
Had the sun risen in the west and set in the
east, doubtless the inhabitants of Bonus Court
would have expressed some surprise, in
common
with the other citizens of the Quaker
City, but that Rent Day should come and go
without Israel Bonus, this was a thing which
made every heart in Bonus Court dilate with
a feeling akin to awe
Never for thirty years had Israel been
known to miss a Rent Day.
Hannah, said the Millerite Preacher,
taking his broad rimmed hat, on the third
morning after the fire: This absence of
Israel Bonus fills me with wonder. I will
call at his house  something may have
happened
to him. The day draws near, Hannah,
when the Lord will come in the clouds of
Heaven, we must meet him with clean hands
and pure hearts. I would not wrong Israel out
of his rent, though he is hard upon the poor.
And while I am gone my child, do you take
some wood and some bread to poor Nancy
over the way. Her husband is in jail, you
know, on a charge of theft. The poor woman
must not be forgotten.
I will not forget her father, was the
response
of Hannah, as she pressed her father's
hand, while her face warmed with the same
looks of calm enthusiasm, which animated the
countenance of the Millerite Preacher.
You have heard nothing of Fanny  or
Ralph?
Not a word. Their disappearance is
mysterious. And what is still more
remarkable
,
Mr. Jervis, the popular preacher, has not
been heard of since the night of the fire.
The Millerite left his home, and made the
best of his way to the residence of israel
Bonus
.
The sun was shining brightly upon the
face of the mansion, as the Millerite paused at
the foot of its marble steps. But there was
an air of unusual desertion about the residence
of Bonus, which the bright sunshine only
made more apparent.
It was an old house, three stories high, and
presenting the appearance of age and wear, in
every faded brick. It stood in a wide street,
not far from the heart of the city, and yet
removed
from its noise and bustle, as effectually
as though it had been built in the very heart of
Bonus Court. It was one of those mansions,
which are not so much remarkable for the
prime neatness of their exterior
characteristic
of the great mass of buildings in the Quaker
City  as for a look of battered antiquity,
which spreads like a great spider web, over
the surface of dingy brick, from the garret to
the cellar.
Marvin when passing this way, had often
noticed the windows on the lower floor, which
were adorned by curtains of faded green
reaching
half way up the uncleanly window-panes.
And who among the thousands of passers-by
had not noticed the tin sign, which affixed to
a shutter, bore in faded letters this significant
inscription:
ISRAEL BONUS,
CONVEYANCER.
N. B. Real Estate bought and sold.
But to the great surprise of Marvin, the
shutters on the lower floor were closed, hiding
green curtains, dirty windows, and the very
name of Bonus, from the public gaze. The
upper windows had no shutters, and therefore
it may be reasonably imagined, that their dusty
panes were opened to the light of the winter's
12
day. The house, faded at all times, and
always reminding the spectator of an old
parchment deed, now looked as though it had
not been tenanted for years.
Marvin ascended the marble steps covered
with snow and ice, and rung the bell, whose
nandle was coated with a rich layer of
verdigris
,
and waited with some impatience for the
sound of Bonus' footstep. Bonus, when
destitute
of a housekeeper, or a housekeeper's
pretty daughter, was wont to answer the bell
himself, and dart upon his visiter in all the
magnitude of ruffled shirt, fair-top boots, and
bone-headed cane.
Marvin rang and waited in vain. A half an
hour elapsed, and still no Bonus appeared.
Casting his eye along the door, he for the first
time beheld a small piece of paper, pasted
upon the panel, and containing the following
important information:
OUT OF TOWN:
Back in a few days
.
Gone to see some of his relations who live
in the country, soliloquized Marvin, as he
returned slowly homeward. He has no
relatives in this city, I believe. An old
bachelor
,
without a soul on earth to care for him,
or bear his name.
Two days passed, and yet Israel Bonus did
not appear in Bonus Court.
The wonder of the tenants increased beyond
all power of expression.
Five days had now elapsed since Bonus had
been seen on Third street. The Men of
Money began to wonder at his absence. His
fair-top boots were sadly missed along the
Coast of Barbary, and the Algerines began to
ask of one another: What has become of
Bonus?
To top the climax, and develope simple
wonder into the very intensity of astonishment,
on the fifth day a note of Bonus' for five
hundred dollars, due at the Shaver's Bank, was
handed over to the Notary Public.
Bonus
protested!
Third street began to
shake in its shoes, and the Board of Brokers
was affected to its inmost soul.
On the morning of the fifth day, Marvin
once more ascended the marble steps  after a
due survey of the closed shutters  and once
more pulled the bell, with a verdigris handle.
The notice of Bonus' absence was still pasted
to the door  and Marvin pulled and pulled
for an half an hour, without awaking the most
remote sign of life in the silent mansion.
At length he tried the handle of the door.
It yielded to his touch, and the door sprung
open.
Strange indeed! Israel out of town and
the door not locked! ejaculated Marvin, as
he surveyed the broad entry by the light of the
morning sun: The old man may be sick.
At least it will do no harm to enter and test the
matter for myself.
He entered the house of Israel Bonus, and
passing along the entry  whose chill
atmosphere
pierced his very marrow  he soon
stood at the foot of the stairs, which lighted by
a circular window, wound upward into the
second and third stories.
He listened for a moment: all was
breathlessly
still. He began to ascend the stairs,
and discovered with some surprise, that every
step was littered with small pieces of
parchment
,
looking like the fragments of old title
deeds. He reached the entry of the second
story, and beheld the sun shining through the
door at its farther end. Along the entry and
through the door he passed, and in a moment
found himself in a large room, furnished with
but four articles of use or adornment.
A huge pine desk, painted red; an old
stool with three legs; a chair with a broken
back; and a map of building lots pinned to
the smoky wall.
This was the Confessional Box of Bonus,
where Bonus lent money, and listened to the
pleas of money borrowers, and wrote their
names in his big book, with a red morocco
back.
He is certainly out of town, murmured
Marvin  But bless me, what does this
mean?
Under the red desk, a mass of papers was
rudely scattered, which to the eyes of Marvin
looked like the wrecks of an hundred title
deeds. The floor was littered with bits of
parchment. The cover of the great book with
a morocco back lay near the fireless grate, and
on the bars of the grate itself, were piled the
leaves of the great book, evidently in readiness
for the application of a lighted match. In a
word, the sanctuary of Bonus had been violated
by unholy hands. The great book, in which
was inscribed the damnation of a thousand
souls, was now only a mass of fragments. The
title deeds, and mortgages of Bonus, severed
into innumerable little pieces, now only served
to relieve the nakedness of the uncarpeted
floor.
There have been robbers in this house!
ejaculated Marvin.
Was it a fancy! The sound of a human
voice, seemed echoing faintly, in the next
room. A very low voice, murmuring in a
monotonous tone, reached the ears of the
Millerite
Preacher. He left the sanctuary of
Bonus
,
passed into the entry, and halted before
the door of the back room.
He now heard the voice again, but could
not distinguish the words. Hush! Pressing
his head against the door he listens  there are
two voices! He hears them distinctly and
can gather the meaning of their words.
Those words leave Marvin no time for
thought. Silently unclosing the door, he
gazes through the aperture, and beholds a bed
resting under the light of two windows,
opening
toward the yard of Bonus' house.
And on that bed is stretched Isarel Bonus,
in full dress  wide skirted coat, ruffled shirt
and fair-top boots. His broad rim and bone
headed cane, lay on a chair, near the bedside.
Bonus in full uniform, Bonus in bed with his
clothes on, but alas! no longer the gay, jocund
Bonus of other days!
For, holding the door slightly open  gazing
through the aperture as he pauses on the
threshold  William Marvin, beholds the face
of Israel Bonus, as it is turned upwards
towards
the light.
That face is hideous with the same
pestilence
which destroyed the life of Ann Clarke.
Blotched from the double-chin to the eyes,
buried in wrinkles  blotched in every line
and feature  the face of Israel Bonus presents
a loathsome spectacle. His very eyes are
sealed by the pestilence. His hands, still
encircled
by rufiles, are covered with the marks
of the appalling disease.
And stretched upon the coverlet, in his every
day attire, the wretched man turns his head
from side to side, lifts his blinded eyeballs to
the light, and moves his clotted lips
Thee must pay the mortgage by twelve
o'clock, this day, or verily I will foreclose.
These words escape from his lips, as he
tosses about, in the delirium engendered by
the pestilence.
Marvin listened no longer, but opening wide
the door entered the room. Entered, and
stood thunderstricken by a new surprise.
There, perched upon a chair at the foot of
the bed, was the figure of a half-naked man,
who resting his elbows on his knees, and his
cheeks in his hands, gazed steadily upon the
face of Israel Bonus. A pair of coarse
trowsers
and a check shirt, constituted the apparel
of this man who watched by the bed of
pestilence
.
His hair, tangled and disordered, fell
over his forehead to the very brows, but could
not veil the intense glare of his eyes.
Do you think I must pay the mortgage
Isr'el? exclaimed the half-naked man, in a
jesting tone  Couldn't you let me have a
leetle time?
Thee must pay or I will foreclose! Thee
must pay or I will foreclose! was the
response
of the delirious Bonus.
Marvin advanced, and at once the truth burst
upon him, as he took a nearer view of the
features of the man at the foot of the bed.
It was John Cattermill, watching by the
death-bed of Israel Bonus.
John! John! ejaculated Marvin: What
does this mean?
Without starting the man raised his face
from his hands, and surveyed Marvin with a
steady but half-vacant look.
Mornin' Sir. Sit down and take a cheer.
We're rayther bad off for wood, and so I had
to make a fire as well as I could out o' them
old books and papers.
Marvin, glancing over his shoulder, beheld
the grate packed to its topmost bar, with huge
account books and parchment deeds. A slight
flame, half choked in a cloud of smoke,
ascended from the mass.
John! John! What have you been doing?
John very quietly replied:
You know I was put in M'yamensin' last
Sunday night?
Yes  very sorry I was to hear of it.
Well, on Tuesday mornin' I was brought
up for a hearin' afore Alderman Rumjug. But
I giv' the officer the slip, and came here to
have a talk with old Bonus. I got in the back
way, over the fence, and by that winder.
What was your intention, John? Surely
you did not mean
Fact is Mr. Marvin, I meant to settle an
old account with the man. I was sure of goin'
to jail for an offence which I never committed,
so I thought I'd giv' 'em a reason for lockin'
me up. You may have heer'd that I was
rayther a quiet, sober sort of man, afore I met
old Bonus?
Yes, John. You never drank until you
encountered him
And arter I met him, I became a drunkard
a loafer  and was in a fair way to become
a thief. So, I thought all this over, and last
Tuesday mornin' I crawled into that winder,
afore Bonus was up, and to be candid with
you, did think of givin' him a rap or two with
some stick or poker, over his head. But
Yes, John. But you relented
I found him in bed, sick with a fever. I
took pity on him.
The face of John, haggard and pale, with an
inexplicable light in the large vacant eyes, was
agitated by a slight grimace as he uttered these
words.
I took pity on him. Found a notice on
his table  `
Out of Town: won't be back
'till next week
and put it on the front door.
Didn't want anybody to disturb him, you
know? That was on Tuesday  this is
Saturday. Ain't I a good Christian? Ever
since Tuesday I've watched by the old man's
bed.
But John, why have you destroyed these
books and papers
There wasn't no wood. Do you think I
was a-goin' to let the old critter suffer for
fire?
You attended to his wants, then? How
did you procure food?
There was a cold b'iled ham in the cellar.
That I've lived upon myself. As for Bonus
he looked into Marvin's face with a broad
grin  Don't you think a severe course o'
dietin' is good for a disease like
that?
He pointed with his lean and skinny hand
toward the bed.
John, John, how could you behold the old
man suffer, without extending a hand for his
relief?
Did you think I was a-goin' to give him
bread, when it 'ud only heighten his fever?
As for water  Lord bless you! He cried for
it often enough, but knew more o' th' natur' o'
his disease than to give it to him. Not a drop!
Not a drop!
This is too horrible for belief! ejaculated
Marvin, gazing first upon the half naked man,
and then upon the wretched occupant of the
bed.
Horrible? How green you talk! Don't
you know that unless all of old Bonus's had
blood comes out in the shape of eruptions, that
the dear old man 'ill kick the bucket? Jist
look at him! You think them's small pox on
his face? Bless your soul  no! It's only
the mortgages and ground rents a-comin' out.
That's all.
And at these words, he placed his elbows on
his knees, his cheeks between his hands, and
turned his eyes to the bed once more.
Isr'el, I raly can't pay up to-day  he
exclaimed, assuming the tone of a pleading
debtor  You won't turn me out into the
street  will you?
If thee cannot pay thee must go! said
the delirious Bonus  Hair and hide, bag
and baggage, thee must go! What? Does
thee think I am to be defrauded of my rent in
this manner? Tut-tut!
Rulin' passion strong in death, cried
John, turning his face to Marvin, with a
grotesque
leer  Don't you think when he goes
down there
, he'll be apt to get a mortgage on
the Devil hisself, and turn the imps out o'
perdition
,
for not payin' ground rent? Hey?
John, how can you desert your wife?
exclaimed
Marvin, wishing to touch the heart of
this monomaniac  Poor Nancy! She is
destitute of bread and wood
One's duty to the public al'ays take the
precedence of private affairs, answered John;
I've watched by Bonus since last Tuesday,
and I'll sit here till he gets well. You little
know how I love that ar' old crittur!
Marvin approached the bed. His face was
clouded by an expression of unfeigned horror,
when he saw that Israel Bonus, dying as much
of starvation as of disease  was near his last
hour. Tossing on the pillow, rolling his
blinded eyeballs from side to side, the dying
man still murmured in his delirium
Can thee pay? If thee can't pay, thee
must go! So, thee has a pretty daughter?
Eh? Then thee shall come and keep house
for me, and I'll take care of thee daughter's
education. Not less than two per cent a month.
Could'nt think of it. How did thee say
Pennsylvania Fives were yesterday? Can
thee pay? Don't talk to me. If thee can't pay
thee must go.
Jist hear him, whispered John  ain't
it a treat? What's that the poet says about
the good man's death?
The eyes of Cattermill began to assume an
expression, which impressed the mind of
Marvin
with a sensation of terror, which he in
vain endeavoured to repress.
He is mad, the thought crept over him
and if I attempt to leave the room, he will
prevent me with a madman's strength.
Well, John, I must go home, he said
aloud, moving to the door  call and see us
when Bonus recovers.
To his utter surprise, John calmly replied
Good mornin', sir. The next time you
walk this way, drop in and see us.
Marvin left the room and hurried from the
house, and in five minutes again returned with
a crowd of neighbours, whom he had
summoned
to his assistance.
Once more he opened the door, and followed
by the wondering crowd, entered the
death-room
.
Israel Bonus was there, not stretched upon
the bed, but seated in an arm chair, near a
window, with his broad rim on his head, and
his cane in his hand.
Israel Bonus was alone; seated in the arm
chair which had so long been the throne of
Mortgage, Ground Rent, and Title Deed; with
half his face in shadow, and the lower portion
blotched by pestilence, bathed in the cheerful
light of the morning sun.
It did not need a second glance to tell the
spectators that Israel Bonus was no longer
numbered among the living.
John Cattermill had disappeared  no one
could tell how  and the spectators, gathering
silently around the dead man, with wonder
and awe upon every face, stood for many
minutes, rooted to the floor, their eyes centred
upon the dead face of Israel Bonus.
John Cattermill was never seen again in
the Quaker City.
CHAPTER THIRTY-SIXTH.
THE END OF THE WORLD DRAWS NIGH.
Charles Lester, recovering from his fever,
began to walk abroad again.
The spring was upon the earth once more,
and despite the gloom which overshadowed
him, he began to feel the blood bounding freely
in his veins again. Peter pursued his search
after the Preacher; and of course his search
was vain.
Charles was much in company with the
Millerite Preacher. His mind, depressed by
an ever present sorrow, was prepared for the
reception of the Millerite's doctrine. They
talked long and earnestly together together
they read the Bible, and attempted to follow
the finger of God, in the book of Daniel and
the book of Revelations.
Is Charley a-goin' to jine these Millerites?
Peter soliloquized one day; Should like to
know. Wish I could get him out of this town,
into the prairies once more. Bad, very bad,
the atmosphere of the Quaker City.
A month passed in this manner. Still no
intelligence reached the ears of Charles Lester
concerning the Preacher or the daughter of
Alice Bayne. Wandering through the city,
day after day, in company with Marvin the
Millerite, Charles sought incessantly for the
Preacher and for Fanny, and his search was
fruitless.
And the Millerite many times concluded his
long and earnest conversations, with these
singular
words:
Never mind, Charles. These matters will
soon cease to trouble you. The twenty-third
of April draws nigh.
Charles' eyes, vacant at other times with the
abstraction of a settled melancholy, would light
up at these words, and impart a look of sudden
rapture to his haggard face.
For at the moment when the birds were
singing, and the leaves were budding  when
the world recovering from the death of winter
was springing into life again  Charles had
given up all the prospects and hopes of
existence
.
He was the last of his race. The graves of
all his people were in the churchyard of the
western land.
Fanny, the daughter of Alice, whom he had
hoped to save, was now lost to him, and lost
to purity forever. The last victim of the
Popular Preacher, she was following the path
which led to an untimely death and an unblest
grave.
The twenty-third of April! these words
often passed the lips of Charles after a
long-continued
reverie.
On the Twenty-third of April the world was
to come to an End.
The Saviour would appear in the clouds of
heaven; the earth and all the elements would
melt with fervent heat. The awful images of
the Revelations would start into actual life.
From the chaos of an expiring universe, a new
heaven and a new earth would struggle into
being.
How many thousand, and tens of thousands
in the year 1843, throughout the extent of the
Union, held this belief, and daily watched for
the coming of the Lord?
How many hearts throbbed with unutterable
awe, at the mention of the day, when all these
things should come to pass  the twenty-third
of April, 1843?
The Twenty Third of April came at last.
In the morning, Peter who had wandered
into the  Hotel in Chesnut Street, (where
seated in the reading room he awaited the
appearance
of Charles,) was much interested in
the following paragraph which met his eye in
the columns of the Daily Copper:
The Rev. Edmund Jervis
.This cloquent
gentleman
was in Adamston, State of Illinois, in the latter
part of March. We are pleased to learn that an
extensive
and interesting revival of religion, was in
progress
in Adamstown during the presence of this pious
and eminent Minister. Thousands were affected to tears
by his preaching, and hundreds, impelled to a better
life by his irresistible appeals, have become members
of his Church. Indeed wherever this gentleman goes,
the blessings of Providence attends his efforts, in a
manner too remarkable not to be mentioned.
This paragraph, its grammar, piety and
praise, was evidently from the pen of Slinkum
Scissleby, Sub-Editor of the Daily Copper.
Adamston is not five miles from Prairie
Home, ejaculated Peter, Charley must
know this afore I'm a-second older. The vil
lian! Holdin' one of his revivals not five
miles from Ellen's grave!
Peter hurried without delay to the room of
Charles, but Charles was not to be found.
He is in Bonus Court with that Millerite!
exclaimed Peter, and without delay he hurried
to Bonus Court.
The place, drear and gloomy at all times,
now looked the very abode of desolation.
The house where Ann Clarke had died, was
tenantless. The doors and windows were
open, and the dust had accumulated on the
floors. At least one-half of the houses of
Bonus
Court were in a similar condition.
Peter hurried to the residence of the Rev.
William Marvin. Doors and shutters closed,
it presented a blank and deserted appearance.
This is queer, soliloquized Peter
Everybody out o' town and Charley not to
be found.
As he spoke, his attention was attracted by
a paper pasted upon the shutter, and bearing
the following inscription, traced in a round
and legible hand:
The owner of this house
has gone to wait the coming of the Lord.
Wm. Marvin
.
April
23, 1843.
Well he might a-told me
whar
he's gone
to, and
whar
he expects to find the Lord!
Thus soliloquizing, Peter once more
departed
on his search. All day long he sought
for Charles  sought in every haunt of
business
or pleasure  in the Hotels, the Stores,
and along the crowded streets  and toward
night, was forced to give up the search in very
despair.
As night fell, he went to the Post Office, as
was his custom and enquired for a letter for
Charles Lester.
To his surprise, the clerk placed a letter in
his hand, directed to
Charles Lester
,
Philadelphia
, and bearing the following
post-mark Prairie-Home, Ill., April 5.
This letter completed the wonder and
deepened
the anxiety of our good friend Peter.
Prairie Home! Did'nt know that anybody
thar
know'd anything about Charley's comin'
to 'Fildelfy. What's this letter about? That
Preacher and the gal! I'll stake my head upon
it.
Much perplexed, Peter returned to the
Hotel, and took his seat in the reading room,
inspecting the face of every new-comer, in his
anxiety to behold the countenance of Charles
Lester once more. Attired still in the scarlet
coat, he placed his huge boots upon a
neighboring
chair, drew a cigar from his pocket, and
soon encircled himself in a cloud of tobacco
smoke. His eyes fixed upon the letter he
resigned
himself to his meditations, and
murmured
every now and then, between the puffs
of smoke, some broken sentence like this
Know'd her when she was a baby. Know'd
her when she was a gal. Know'd her when
she was a corpse.
The honest backwoodsman, thus quietly
meditating, little knew the contents of the
letter, which he held in his brawny hand.
CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVENTH.
THE CAMP OF THE LORD.
Leave Philadelphia, reader, and cross the
Schuylkill by the Market Street Bridge.
Follow the road that leads into the open
country, and do not pause, until you stand
beside
a black and barren field which slopes from
the turnpike to a distant wood.
The sky is obscured by driving clouds.
A misty rain is falling, and the wind howls
in gusts.
Gaze over the bleak expanse of this field,
and tell me, what is it that intervenes between
your gaze, and the dull leaden sky?
A white tent, rising distinctly from the brown
field, and with gleams of light escaping from
its parted curtains.
From that tent, a low murmuring sound
escapes. Approach its curtains; do not heed
the leaden sky and driving blast; cross the
field, and stand within the gleam of those
wandering rays. Listen!
That sound, lately so low and murmuring,
now becomes distinct and intelligible.
It is the voice of praise and prayer. The
voices of men, women, and children, melting
together, in one incessant hymn and
supplication
.
This white tent, echoing with praise and
prayer, the storm beating on its roof, and the
bleak waste and the dark night, all around it,
strikes you with an impression of curiosity
modified by awe.
You pause on the drenched sod; you place
your hand upon the curtain; while the gust
howls over the field, you part the curtains and
look within:
Dim lights are burning there. Rude tallow
candles, inserted into rough boards, shed their
uncertain light over a thousand faces. The
faces of aged men  of fair and delicate
women  of children, who had scarcely passed
the dawn of life  all uplifted, and all imbued
with the same look of rapture and fear.
They are singing now  listen to their
hymn!
Its burden steals into your soul, you know
not why. 'Tis but an unpretending hymn,
deficient
in rhyme and rugged in its words, and
yet the voices of these kneeling worshippers,
mingling in one sound, as if their hearts were
inspired by one soul, impart to it a music and
a passion that may well be deemed
supernatural
.
The Lord is coming  this is the burden
of the hymn  ere the midnight hour has
struck, Jesus will come in the clouds of
Heaven, and call his wandering children home.
The unbelievers will expire in the agonies of
an expiring world. The children of the Lord,
those who have loved his name and watched
for him long, will pass into Eternity without
the change of death. Gathered from a
burning
world, by the Divine Redeemer, they will
arise at once  without a sigh or pang to the
Mansions of their God.
In a word, reader, we are in the Camp of
the Millerites. These men and women, these
rich and poor, these people gathered from all
classes of the social world, have pitched their
tent in the barren field, away from the sin and
life of the Great City, and here they have
determined
to await the coming of the Lord.
Do not call them fanatics. Grave Divines,
for hundreds of years, have been writing great
books, concerning the Prophecies of Daniel and
the Book of Revelations. These people of
the tent, these despised Milllerites have merely
carried the speculations of the learned Divines
into practice. They have summed up the
opinions of the sagacious theologians,
concerning
the Millenium, and the amount of their
researches
,
is comprised in this line
On the Twenty-third of April, 1843, the
world will come to an end, and the Millenium
begin.
Do not treat with idle scorn this fanaticism
of the Millerites. It is true, that the only
Millenium preached by the Bible of
Revelation
,
and the Bible of Nature, is embraced in
a single brief sentence:
When every man in the world looks to
the welfare of his brother, then the Lord
Christ will appear on the earth, not in bodily
shape, but in the happiness of the whole
family
of man
.
The truth contained in this sentence, has
been too simple for your Theologians. They
prefer to amuse themselves with speculations
on the moods and tenses of dead languages, or
the Prophecies of Daniel, or the Mysteries
of Revelations  and blunder deeper into
learned darkness, until they have left the plain
facts of the Gospel of Nazareth, altogether out
of sight. Do you blame the poor that they
have at last believed the theologians, and
turned their theological riddle into an
every-day
fact?
A solitary man stands up in the centre of
the kneeling throng. It is William Marvin,
whose plain features are now imbued with a
calm  almost  god-like rapture. Clasping
his knees, a little child with hazel eyes and
nut-brown hair looks lovingly into his face.
And behind Marvin, in the shadows of the
rude pillar which supports the roof of the tent,
behold a young man who stands alone, with
folded arms and head bent upon his breast.
His eyes are well-nigh buried under his
compressed
brows: there are the traces of a violent
mental struggle  a struggle of doubt and hope
visible in every line of his countenance.
It is Charles Lester, listening in silence to
the words of the Millerite Preacher.
Brothers! Sisters! The time approaches.
The end of all things is at hand. The voice
of Marvin scarcely rising above a whisper, is
heard distinctly in every part of the tent; heard
in every heart, and answered by sobs of prayer.
The hour of twelve is near. When the clock
strikes twelve, the Lord will come.
These words doubtless seem altogether plain
and unmeaning. But there was the power of
a singular magnetism in the Preacher's eye,
and every heart within the shelter of that
tabernacle, beat with that divine magnetism
which men call FAITH.
Charles Lester drew forth his watch: it was
within five minutes of the hour of twelve.
Impressed by the long conversation of the
Millerite, and yet unable to believe in his
doctrine, Charles had come to this tent as a
mere spectator. He had watched there all
day long. And now against his will he
felt the magnetic tide which flowed from heart
to heart  pervading the crowd as with the
pulsation of a supernatural power  glide into
his own soul, and storm the last entrenchment
of his unbelief.
His eyes caught the fire which shone from
a thousand eyes. He clasped his hands, and
raised his voice in prayer.
Beside the form of the Millerite, rose the
figure of a woman clad in white, who lifted
her hands above the crowd, and spoke to their
hearts a rhapsody such as might have fallen
from a Prophetess of the far gone olden time.
A young woman, whose plain features,
shaded by light brown hair, warmed suddenly
into a hallowed beauty  whose eyes of dark
grey, suddenly shone with the clear deep
lustre of enthusiasm or prophecy  whose
voice, at first faint and tremulous, rose
gradually
into accents of melody, which swept into
every heart like music from a Better World.
It was Hannah Marvin, the Millerite's
Daughter.
Alone she stood, lifted above the crowd, her
whole dress standing out palpably from the
background of deep shadow.
It was now within three minutes of the
hour of twelve.
He comes! The Lord who walked the
sands of Palestine, and watered the earth with
tears. He comes! The Lord who made his
resting place with the Poor, and went day
after day, among their homes, raising their
sick, feeding their suffering and telling every
one  even the basest child of want  `in
my Father's house are many mansions '
At this moment, Charles who stood near
the pillar, entranced as much by the tone as by
the words of the Woman, felt an unknown
hand pressed within his own. He turned and
beheld the rugged visage of our friend Peter
Read! he whispered foreing a letter into
the hand of Lester.
Charles broke the seal, and by the dim light
read the letter, and without pausing for a
moment
after he had devoured its contents, he
descended
from the platform and hurried through
the kneeling crowd, with Peter following at
his heels.
Whither go you! cried Marvin, his eye
vacant and absent, with the light of enthusiam.
Charles did not pause to answer, but
hurried
on.
He goes to mingle once more with the
cares and sins of earth, the voice of the
Millerite Prophetess reached the ears of the
fugitive  Woe! woe! to the disciple who
turns his back upon the Lord!
And the words were echoed by a thousand
voices, but Charles hurried on. The contents
of the letter, eagerly traced by the dim light,
had once more aroused the fires of Revenge
within his breast. His teeth set together, his
face corrugated with the dark lines of hatred,
he rushed from the tent into the dark night,
exclaiming as he pointed to the distant city:
There lies our way! We will track this
fiend in human shape to the end of the earth!
Before morning light, we must be on our way
to the wes:  aye  on our way to Prairie
Home.
And they went forth together, the hardy
back woodsman and the Brother of Ellen.
Meanwhile within the tent of the Millerites,
a thousand hearts were beating in expectation
of the Coming Lord. While the Prophetess
spoke, her every word answered by bursts of
praise and prayer, the last three minutes passed
away.
The hour of twelve came at last.
And a thousand hearts were hushed in awe
while the voice of the Woman were in the
accents of triumph that was almost divine
Arise! Arise! I hear the footsteps of the
Lord  I feel the rustling of the angels' wings
I feel the presence of our God! Arise!
Arise! And greet the first day of the
new-born
world!
And for three days and nights they waited
there in rain and storm, in hunger and cold,
looking to Heaven with a faith that grew
stronger with every hour.
And returning at last, sad and dispirited to
their deserted homes  mocked at every step
by scoffs and jeers  derided by the very
Theologians whose speculations they had so
blindly followed  these believers in the
Millenium, sat once more amid the cares and
and pains of life.
Many of them who had looked for the Lord
in the clouds of Heaven, found him in the quiet
of their Homes and in the peace of their
Hearts.
Shall we read the letter, which postmarked
Prairie Home, aroused once more the love
of life and the passion of vengeance within the
breast of Charles Lester? A single paragraph
may throw some light upon the progress of
this history:
Prairie Home
, Ill.,
April 4, 1843.
Jervis has been preaching in this county. He is
accompanied
by a man who calls himself
Dr. Arthur
Baldwin
, and who has two young persons with him,
whom he calls his children. Do you know anything
of this Popular Preacher? May he not be the same
person who, under an assumed name * * * *
* * * * * * * *
And thus it appeared that Fanny and Ralph
had discovered their Father at last.
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTH.
CHOKTIPAW.
Do you see yonder mansion which stands
upon the hill, above the town of Choktipaw?
The night is dark; the sky is obscured by
one dense mass of leaden clouds, fringed with
lightning gleams upon the horizon, and the
town of Choktipaw sleeps quiet and snug
between the hillside and the broad river. But
this mansion, tall and stately, and built
half-way
up the hill, is illuminated from garret to
cellar. The lofty trees which rise on either
hand, with trunks like sculptured columns,
and foliage thick and branching like the
canopy
of a tent, are reddened on every leaf by
the gleams of light which stream from the
mansion windows.
That house to-night may be seen from a
great distance. Illuminated for a festival, and
crowded with guests from far and near, it
shines through the darkness, and looks glad
13
and joyous in the midst of the black and
desolate night.
And where is this town of Choktipaw? In
Arkansas, good friend, near a commanding hill
and upon the shore of a broad river. More
we dare not tell.
For a week the town of Choktipaw has
been the scene of great excitement. The
Celebrated Preacher  the Popular Preacher
the eloquent and pious Edmund Jervis,
appeared last week in Choktipaw, and has
preached in the  Church of
Choktipaw
,
and fired all Choktipaw with the
enthusiasm of his own saintly soul. For a
week a revival has been in progress; one of
the Popular Preacher's revivals, which spread
like fire in a drought, and bring mourners by
hundreds to the altar.
Everybody is occupied with Jervis. His
looks, his tones, the whiteness of his cravat,
the elegant fit of his black frock coat, the
pathos of his uplifted eyes, the alabaster
delicacy
of his hands, the sweetness of his manner
such have been the topics of Choktipaw for
a week, and Choktipaw still talks them over
and over again.
And to-night the Great Preacher is to be
married. To whom? Do not be impatient.
Look through the windows of this elegant
mansion on the hillside, and survey the
brilliant
assemblage of wedding guests. Beautiful
girls, grave matrons, sober farmers, and
dashing
gentlemen of much leisure and many
slaves, are gathered there in a spacious parlor,
by the light of waxen candles, awaiting
impatiently
the appearance of three persons
the Minister, the Bridegroom, and the Bride.
For the whole country, at least the religion
and gentility of the country for twenty miles,
have been gathered to-night to the mansion of
Col. Thorberry, where the Popular Preacher
is to wed his young and beautiful Bride.
While the guests are waiting on the
ground-floor
,
while the rich steams of the marriage
supper steal out into the open air, and charm
the nostrils of the negroes, who are grouped
near the brilliantly illuminated windows  let
us ascend into a chamber on the second floor,
and listen to an important conversation.
A grave sedate man, with a round face,
short and portly figure, black dress and white
cravat, is seated in an arm chair, beside a
table, on which a lamp is burning. He rests
his elbow on the table, and supports his round
cheek in the hollow of his hand, and gazes
with a calm sweet look, into the face of a
young girl, who attired in spotless white, kneels
at his feet, and places her clasped hands upon
his knees.
Her dark hair is covered by a veil of
transparent
lace, which relieves the colorless
pallour
of her face, and imparts a new loveliness
to her calm white forehead, and delicately
pencilled
brows. Beautiful in her white bridal
dress, she looks upward, into her Father's
face, her large eyes swimming in tears.
For it is Fanny and her Father that we
behold
.
In other words, Dr. Arthur Baldwin
and his long lost Daughter. But Dr. Baldwin
has been dead for a year past  Has he?
Tell that story to the gossips of Choktipaw
and they will laugh in your face. Do they
not know the whole story? How the
eloquent
Preacher discovered the long lost daughter
of the wealthy Dr. Baldwin, in the suburbs of
Philadelphia, and how the beautiful girl fell
in love with the Preacher, and obtained her
father's consent for the marriage? Not a child
in all Choktipaw but has the story by heart.
And now, while the marriage supper is
preparing
and while the marriage guests are
waiting
,
here in this quiet chamber, the Father and
the Daughter have met for an interesting
conversation
.
Did not Edmund discover you in
Philadelphia
?
Yes, Father
Did he not rescue you and Harry from the
dangers of a city life? Answer me, Annie?
Annie and Harry you must bear in mind,
have taken the place of Fanny and Ralph?
Yes, father
Did not Edmund send me word that he
had found you  found my long lost
children
the Dr. passed a finger over each eye;
And did he not bring you to meet me,
without
delay?
I remember it well, father. We met
near Prairie Home in Illinois. And then we
resumed our journey, and came to this town
a week ago. I remember it all, and thank
Edmund
for his kindness, and speak of him every
hour, in my prayers, but
But
Annie! answered Dr. Baldwin, gently
raising his right hand, while an expression of
deep sorrow came over his face
But
you
don't wish to marry him. Can it be, my child!
Edmund who has restored you to my arms
Edmund who has been the means of your
conversion
Edmund who walks the earth, like
a Disciple of the Apostolic era  Edmund,
gifted, pious, eloquent and popular! And
you do not wish to marry a man like this!
My child, my child!
Covering his face with his hands, he seemed
much affected by the conduct of his beloved
child. Poor Fanny  for we must call her
by her old name  beheld his unfeigned
emotion
,
and burst into tears.
Father! Father! Do not I beseech you,
think me ungrateful or unkind! You have
only to speak and I will obey
He raised his eyes, and smiled and patted
her cheek with his hand.
That's a good child. You will obey your
poor, weak, affectionate father, who loves you,
all too fondly? You will chase these tears
away, and forget these words of disobedience,
and give your hand, willingly to our dear, dear
Edmund?
But Father
That's enough, my dear. Go, child. Your
bridesmaids are waiting for you in the next
room. Go  compose your thoughts
whisper
a prayer or two that the old Adam may
be conquered in your heart  and prepare to
meet your dear Edmund, with a loving heart,
and countenance adorned with peace.
He raised Fanny from her knees. Hushing
her words by a gentle pressure of his hand
upon her lips, he urged her to the door, and
kissed her on the forehead, whispering
Bless you my child! Don't break its poor
old father's heart  that's a blessed child.
And thus Fanny left her father, and went to
join her bridal maidens. Dr. Baldwin was
alone. Walking along the carpet, from the
window to the light, and back again, he seemed
absorbed in a pleasing reverie. He drew forth
his watch, after a silence of some fifteen
minutes
and exclaimed
Half-past eight! Eh? The time moves
slowly. At nine they are married.
When he raised his gaze from the watch,
the Popular Preacher stood before him.
You may have often heard the bold figure,
he looks as if he had just stepped from a
band box  but bold and imaginative as it
seems, it was realized by the Popular Preacher
on this occasion.
His dress coat was of the sleekest and
glossiest
black cloth. His cravat was of cambric,
elaborately starched; his pantaloons, fitting
closely to his limbs, were as black and as
glossy as his faultless coat. Boots of polished
leather, very neat and tight, pinched his feet
into the smallest possible compass. And then
his face  blooming on the cheek, white upon
the forehead, smiling on the lips and flashing
in the eyes  his face seemed to have suddenly
cast aside the burden of twenty years, as a
ripe silk-worm casts aside its caterpillar skin,
and in an instant, starts into a rainbow
butterfly
.
From the cocoon of forty-five years
growth  to grasp a bold figure  the
silk-worm
of a new youth, had emerged into life.
The top-knot on his forehead, was softened
down, into a mild and wavy curl. There was
an odor of cologne and patchoulli about the
man, from head to foot. The delicate hand
we mean his left hand  sparkled with a
diamond
ring upon the marriage finger.
No sooner did the Dr. behold him, than he
laid his finger significantly upon his lips:
Well, Doctor? How is it now?
whispers
the Preacher.
All right. She yields to her fond old
father.
You will marry us Dr.? You are an
Elder of our church you know, and have a
right to celebrate the rites of marriage?
Besides
it will be a fine spectacle  the father
not only giving away his beloved child, but
performing the marriage ceremony for her. It
will have a good effect.
Well, Edmund if you insist. I suppose I
must comply. By the bye Jervis we leave in
the morning
On our way to New Orleans. There
you understand  we will sail for Europe
That is, you and I?
Yes  of course. Leaving these children
in New Orleans, while we make the European
tour in company.
Yes. The funds are all right  eh?
What have you done with Ralph? Harry
I should have said, but one forgets the name
of a child, whom one has lost for nineteen
years.
He is all right, Dr. He has long since
entrusted the tin box to my charge. And
then I have had many opportunities to win
his confidence, during our journey to the west.
You know the boy is uncouth  but
grateful
Where is he now?
I was afraid his rude demeanor might give
our friends an unfavorable opinion of him, so
when he told me an hour ago that he wished
to join a hunting party to-night, I cheerfully
acquiesced. And he will not be back until
morning.
Go my dear Edmund. It is near the time.
Compose your mind for this affecting
ceremony
.
Go  I will join you down stairs in
a few moments.
And with these words the Father parted
from the Bridegroom.
Their conversation which we have just
recorded, may not seem important to the
reader. But had you witnessed the smiles,
the winks and gestures, which accompanied
its every word, you would have been in no
doubt concerning the prospects and intentions
of this worthy pair.
The Marriage Ceremony!
Pale and beautiful in her white robes, Fanny
stood in the centre of the crowd of wedding
guests, and took the Preacher by the hand,
while her father pronounced the marriage
vows.
And many a beautiful damsel there, envied
the lot of the daughter of Alice Bayne, and
many a wealthy father, desired with all his
soul, a Bridegroom like the Preacher for every
one of his children.
When the marriage words were spoken,
Jervis pressed the marriage kiss on the lips
of his young wife. Fanny blushed and
trembled
,
and seemed to shrink from his touch, but
that was only maidenly modesty.
Close upon the heels of the marriage
ceremony
,
followed the marriage supper. Why
chronicle minutely the events of that bountiful
feast? How Fanny in all her blushes, sat at
the head of the table, beside the portly owner
of the mansion, Col. Thorberry; with her
Husband on one hand, and her Father not far
away? How the feast began with a
voluminous
grace and continued for two busy hours,
until midnight drew near?
The negroes are dancing on the lawn
without
,
and the sound of banjo and fiddle, rings
merrily on the air.
A happy marriage, a beautiful bride, a pious,
learned, eloquent and handsome bridegroom!
CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTH. [sic]
THE BRIDAL BED.
Soon after midnight, the Bridesmaids led
the Young Wife to the Bridal Chamber.
And after a prayer, which long and full of
unction, seemed to consecrate the harmless
mirth of the marriage festival, the Bridegroom
slipped quietly away, and went up the
stairway
toward the Bridal Chamber.
At the threshold he paused, even as his
hand was laid upon the door. He listened
all was gaiety and uproar below, but where he
stood a silence like death prevailed.
Gently opening the door, he entered the
Bridal Chamber.
It was the largest chamber in Col.
Thorberry's
elegant mansion. Rich curtains along
the windows, which opened upon the balcony,
rich carpet upon the floor, and pictures in
glittering frames upon the walls.
Upon a small table, near the centre of the
carpet, stood a lamp, which shed a faint, and
yet voluptuous light around the place.
And in the rays of the light, appeared the
snowy canopy of the Marriage Couch, with
curtains as white and stainless, falling to the
carpet, in long and sweeping folds.
As he beheld the bed, the Bridegroom paused
and pressed his finger to his lips, while his
small eyes, enlarging in their sockets, shone
with a fiery lustre.
There, sheltered within the white curtains
like a budding flower, within its leaves
his Bride awaited him.
Fanny! he whispered, in an impassioned
tone, calling her by the name which she had
borne from childhood.
She did not answer.
Was she sleeping?
The Preacher stole on tip-toe to the bed,
and laid his hand upon the curtains. They
were closed, and the Bride was concealed
within their tightly gathered folds.
Fanny! he breathed her name once more
and listened. His face kindled with a warmth
that gave a singular look of youth and passion
to every feature. His eyes emitted a stream
of magnetic light.
Still no answer was heard from within the
curtains of the marriage bed.
She has sunk to slumber, whispered the
Preacher-Bridegroom  I will gaze upon
her as she sleeps. I will wake her with a
kiss.
He drew the curtains and looked within.
He did not behold his young wife's face,
for in her slumber she had drawn the
coverlet
over her head, but the outlines of her
form were dimly perceptible by the faint
light.
Poor child! Scared by an unpleasant
dream, she has buried herself in the coverlet.
Let me wake her gently. Yes, let me wake
her with a kiss.
He slowly raised the coverlet.
And the next instant his face became livid,
he stood paralyzed by the bed, unable to speak
or stir, his lips apart and his eyes projecting
from their sockets.
What was the sight which caused this
sudden
and fearful change?
Fanny in her sleep, with her dark hair,
waving in glossy blackness, over her stainless
bosom? No.
Fanny dead  her eyes fixed  her bosom
pulseless  her stiffened hands, folded over
her lifeless yet beautiful form? No.
Let us explain the mystery in a few words.
When the Preacher slowly lifted the
coverlet
,
a voice very deep and hoarse, and altogether
unlike the mild accents of Fanny, greeted him,
with these remarkable words:
How
air
you?
And the Preacher, in the place of the young
and blooming form of his Bride, beheld a red
face, adorned with white whiskers, and
surrounded
by a fur cap. And beneath this red
face, appeared a huge form, clad in a scarlet
over-coat, corduroy trowsers, and boots with
soles half an inch thick.
It needed no second glance to inform the
Bridegroom, that where his Bride should have
been, his old acquaintance, even the giant
Peter was snugly reposing.
It was indeed our old friend, Peter.
There was an affectionate smile upon his
lips, and a jovial twinkle in his eyes.
How
air
you? he repeated, turning his
face toward the Preacher: How
air
you,
honey? and lovingly he spread forth his
brawny arms.
You cannot fail to perceive, that the Preacher
had good reason for his surprise. Braver men
than Jervis, would have been astonished by an
occurrence like this.
Why don't you speak to me? cried
Peter, extending his brawny hand, and
clenching
the paralyzed wretch by the collar
Don't you love me? Peter displayed his teeth
from ear to ear  Come to bed honey. It's
late and we'll have to be stirrin' airly in the
mornin'.
He dragged the Preacher upon the bed,
and impressed upon him, the sad necessity of
silence with these words:
Jist speak above your breath dear, and
and the cold muzzle of a pistol touched the
Preacher's forehead.
And then Peter, drawing from the
fathomless
depths of his pockets, a piece of cord,
and certain silken handkerchiefs of various
colours, proceeded to bind the limbs of the
bridegroom, even as he lay upon his marriage
bed.
Where is my wife? gasped Jervis.
Ellen? She was in her grave when I
last heer'd from her. You may have a chance
to meet her soon.
You don't mean to kill me? the poor
wretch shuddered, as he lay upon the bridal
bed.
Not so loud. Low, very low you must
speak, if you don't want to raise my temper.
Hark now! The folks down stairs are about
retirin' to their beds. The niggers have gone
away from the front of the house. Now if
you'll do me the kindness, jist obey a few
directions
,
and it 'ill be mighty good for your
wholesome. You hear
I am listening  murmured Jervis.
I'm jist a goin' to carry you out o' the
winder and along the balcony. Thar at the
end of the balcony, a ladder is ready, and
near the ladded a half dozen good fellows, on
stout horses. You'll jist have the kindness,
to let yourself be carried off quietly. That's
all. If you make the least noise, I'll be
obliged to  once more the muzzle of the
pistol touched the forehead of the Preacher.
I consent, faltered the Preacher, only
spare my life.
Peter bound a black kerchief over his eyes.
Then creeping from the bed, he raised the
blindfolded man in his arms and bore him
through the opened window, out upon the
balcony.
The Preacher felt a strange sinking of the
heart, as he passed the confines of his Bridal
Chamber.
Peter passing along the balcony, descended
a ladder which stood at one extremity, and by
this ladder reached the ground. He found
himself in the centre of a crowd of horsemen,
whose faces were not distinguishable in the
darkness.
All right? said a voice  the Preacher
knew it, and muttered to himself the solitary
word: Lester!
Yes  right and snug, exclaimed Peter,
answering the voice.
Mount then, and let's be moving, the
voice was heard again.
Aye, aye, said Peter, as holding the
Preacher in his arms, he sprang into the
saddle.
Forward! cried the voice again, and
twenty horses thundered over the lawn,
toward the public road.
The Preacher, clasped in the firm embrace
of Peter, could not realize the scene. He
believed himself entangled in the wonders of
a nightmare.
For an hour the horsemen pursued their
way in silence. Every time that the Preacher
attempted to speak, his mouth was closed by
Peter's brawny hand.
You see, my dear, Peter whispered,
growing communicative as they dashed along:
You ought to feel grateful to Charles and me.
We came all the way from Fildelfy arter you.
We arriv' jist afore dark to-night at
Choktipaw
,
and met Ralph in the woods a little west
of the town. He spoke of a huntin' party did
he not?
The Preacher uttered a deep groan.
That child looks green, but he ain't.
Bless your soul, not a bit of it. Do you know
that he had overheer'd some conversation
between you and that Dr. Baldwin
whom you
raised from the dead
, and consequently he
begin to have some suspicions about you.
But he did not know what to do, or whom to
talk to. He was resolved, howsomdever, to
watch you and the Doctor purty close, and to
keep an especial eye to that
tin box
. You
take? So jist afore dusk he meets us in the
woods a little west of Choktipaw, and we
soon come to an understandin'. You don't
know who
we
means? Listen, my gospel
brother, and I'll give you a hint. Suppose a
dozen stout boys from Illinois get on your
track, and suppose a dozen boys from
Choktipaw
j'ine 'em. What then? The
Choktipaw
folks (in the secret) go to your weddin'
while the
suckers
from Illinois lay their plans
around the house, and make their reckonin' to
steal your wife away fust  and then her
father  and then
you!
Again the Preacher groaned.
You see Charley wanted to take Fanny
away from the house without raisin' a fuss.
So he waited until the weddin' was over, and
the bride safe in bed, when  d'ye hear, my
friend? When Ralph gits into her room
through the balcony, and has a talk, and a very
important talk it was, with his sister. Arter
that talk, it was all up with you, my dear.
When poor Fan was told by her brother, that
her father wasn't her father, an' that the
minister who married her wasn't a minister
at all  Lord! The poor girl fairly jumped
for joy!
The Preacher uttered a sound between his
teeth, which very much resembled an oath.
One reason why Lester didn't seize you
at the weddin' party, was this, my friend.
The Choktipaw folks, whom he acquainted
with your villany, just wished to see for their
own satisfaction, whether or no you would
really go on with your
mock marriage
. They
saw you married, sat aside o' you at the
supper
,
and then were convinced, that you was
exactly what you
air!
But where are you taking me? groaned
Jervis, as he was borne rapidly over a road,
which led through a dark forest.
Wait a little while, and you'll see. Fanny
and Ralph and
your Dr. Baldwin
, have gone
ahead. They're expectin' us now.
But Col. Thorberry will avenge this
outrage
!
muttered the Preacher.
I'll give you a hundred dollars if you'll
go back to Thorberry's arter we're done
with you: that is supposen' you
can
walk or
ride, arter we're fixed you. Bless your soul,
Thorberry, and all about Choktipaw will
know all about you, to-morrow mornin'. It's
only to spare you the pain o' layin' some
years in jail, that we take you off in this
way, and give you a touch of Justice in the
rough.
CHAPTER THIRTY-NINTH.
THE END OF THE PREACHER.
And the horsemen dashed on. Thus another
hour passed away. At length the company
came to a halt, and the bandage was removed
from the Preacher's eyes. Placed on his feet
once more, he gazed around, and found
himself
in the centre of a novel scene.
It was a nook in the forest bounded by the
the trunks of colossal trees, and shaded by
their closely matted branches.
Torches, held in the hands of brawny
men, dressed in great coats and armed to the
teeth, gave a red glare to the leaves, to the
massive trees, the forms of the horses, and
the faces of the spectators.
Jervis surveyed these spectators, who
encircled
him on every hand. His heart leaped
to his throat, as he recognized many of the
planters, who had graced his marriage supper,
not more than three hours before. And there
too, were sturdy men, from Illinois, whom he
had known during the life of Ellen Lester.
It's all up with us, said a voice at his
back  turning suddenly, Jervis beheld a
half naked figure, very short and somewhat
corpulent, whose uncovered back bore the red
marks of a hickory rod. I could'nt stand
it, Jervis  they struck so awful hard  and
so I owned up. You'd better follow suit.
The voice and the half naked figure
belonged
to the
pretended
Dr. Baldwin.
Aint you a purty pair! the Preacher
knew the voice, and turning, beheld the form
of Ralph, clad in blue jacket and trowsers,
with the tin box in his hand: To go and
run off with a couple o' orphans in this style!
What do you expect will become o' you, arter
the devil gits you?
At this point of the scene, another form
advanced. The Preacher knew the face at a
glance, and a fear, such as he had never felt
before, thrilled him in every vein.
It was Charles Lester. Pale, haggard, his
head uncovered, and eyes deep sunken in
their sockets, he advanced from the crowd,
with weaponless hands, and looked into the
Preacher's face without a word.
The Preacher shrank back from that steady
gaze. He could not meet the eye of Lester.
Friends, you have heard the story of this
man's crimes, said Lester in a voice
unnaturally
calm. I have followed him for many
an hour, and over many a weary mile
Edmund Jervis! we have met at last!
He made a sign to Peter, and Peter came
from the throng of silent spectators, holding a
knotted rope in his hand.
Mercy! Do not hang me! cried Jervis,
as his limbs gave way, and he sank to the
ground: This would be a murder! You
dare not attempt it
Peter without a word, tore the white cravat
away, and arranged one end of the cord around
the Preacher's neck. The other end he flung
over the oaken branch which extended above
the kneeling wretch.
Say the word, and he'll swing, exclaimed
Peter.
You dare not murder me! shrieked the
Popular Preacher, as he felt the rope about
his neck: Brother Markham, Brother
Edmunds
,
Brother Finchley, you know me
you have heard me preach  you will not
permit this outrage! He turned toward the
persons whom he addressed by name, and
who had sat near him at the marriage festival.
There was no response. The torch light
only revealed a circle of stern and unpitying
faces.
Mount my friends, cried Charles Lester.
Before an instant passed every horseman was
mounted again  every one save Peter who
stood beside the criminal. We rest to-night
at your house, friend Williams, which if I
mistake not, is but a quarter of a mile distant
from this place? The young lady whom we
rescued from the clutches of these villians, is
already there? Is she not?
The horseman whom he addressed,
murmured
assent, and the Preacher heard him
declare that Fanny was sleeping in the
mansion
,
not more than a quarter of a mile from
the spot where he was kneeling.
If she was here, she at least would save
me! he gasped, turning his livid face from
the light.
As for the pretended Dr. Baldwin, he was
borne in the arms of a sturdy horseman, who
had determined  in accordance with the
judgment of the company  to convey him
some miles from the scene, and then set him
free with the convict's stripes upon his naked
back.
Are you ready? cried Charles:
Extinguish
the torches, and let us begone!
With one movement the torches were
dashed to the ground, and the scene was
wrapped in darkness. The sound of hoofs
suddenly broke upon the stillness of the
woods.
Spare me, groaned Jervis, when he found
himself alone with Peter  the rope about his
neck and the oaken bough above his head.
Peter did not reply in words, but drew the
limb down toward his breast and tied the rope
firmly around its rugged bark.
When he released his hold the limb sprang
back to its place, and the body of the Preacher
dangled in the air.
I know'd Ellen, ejaculated Peter, as he
left the scene, and walked along the path by
which the horseman had disappeared.
Epilogue.
Wiskonsan!
Among the latest-born of the great family
of American Nations, this young state by her
code of humanity, shames the barbarous
laws which yet prevail in the Atlantic States.
Reader let us leave the Quaker City, and go
forth together, into the free forests of
Wiskonsan
,
where the blessing of God is written
in every flower  where the breeze, that
comes over river and prairie, is not tainted
with the breath of the Great City's crimes.
It is a summer evening, in the year 1848.
Let us stand upon the brow of the rock,
which overlooks the broad river, and drink in
the wild beauty of the prospect, the calm
fragrance
of the evening air. The sky is clear,
and the setting sun, bathes the woods and
rocks which rise yonder, on the opposite shore
of the river.
Look around you  and tell us  what is
it that meets your gaze. Gaze through the
interval, which breaks the compact mass of
foliage, on the heights of the opposite shore.
It is a beautiful prospect. At the end of a
green field, stands a massive house built of
substantial logs, two stories in height and with
a line of blue smoke rising from one of its
many chimneys, into the sky. Behind the
log-house, spreads a prospect of tremulous
gold  a field of wheat, extending as, far as
you can see, until your gaze is lost, in the blue
haze of the distant woods. Skirting this
golden prospect, a field of emerald green, also
extends behind the log-house, and loses its
verdure, only in the shadows of the distant
woods.
It is a beautiful prospect. A log-house
built in the wilderness, not far from the river,
shore, and rising in the very lap of fruitful
fields  fields rich with harvests of emerald
and gold. And on the distant hills, herds of
cattle were grazing, their shadows lengthened
by the setting sun.
Let us cross the river. Let us enter one of
those nooks of shadows and flowers, which
are sunken amid the foliage of the opposite
shores.
There, seated on the sward, behold the
owner of the house, a young and hardy man,
whose rustic attire cannot divert your
attention
from the traces of thought and education,
visible in every lineament of his face.
Beside him, leaning on his arm, behold a
young woman, whose beautiful face is
shadowed by raven hair. Very plainly clad,
and yet very beautiful, she is seated on the
sward, with a child not more than two years
old, upon her knee.
This you will confess, is a picture full of
interest and meaning.
A young husband, a young wife, sitting in
the shadows by the river shore, their faces
turned to the western sky, and their hearts
swelling with that peculiar joy and sorrow,
which is produced by the sight of a calm sky,
a broad river and lonely woods, all bathed in
the glow of departing day.
Thank God for the free woods! exclaims
the Husband, after a long pause.
The wife does not speak, but she takes her
husband by the hand while her eyes fill with
tears. As she compares the Present with the
Past, so dark and troubled, her heart swells
with a sensation of unutterable thankfulness.
And while they are sitting there alone, the
sound of footsteps resound among the bushes,
and presently two new figures appear upon
the scene.
An old but hardy man of almost giant
stature, and a young man whose lithe and
active figure, does not indicate more than
twenty-two years of life. They are dressed
in huntsman's gear: with game-bag,
powder-horn
,
and shot-pouch, and each one carries a
rifle on his shoulder. As they come into
sight, the old man  whose sunburnt face
with white whiskers, beams with the good
nature of a rough but honest heart  is telling
to the young man, some story of adventure in
the wild woods, which brings the fire to his
large grey eyes.
It is Peter and Ralph! cries the young
wife in a glad accent.
And in a moment the new-comers are seated
beside the husband and wife, while the old
man brings forth from the game-bags the fruits
of their ramble in the woods.
We stopped at Marvin Farm in the course
o' th' arternoon, said Peter: All well. Old
Marvin, Hannah, her husband and the leetle
boys.
We were also at Cattermill's a little
while, exclaimed Ralph. I wonder if
Israel Bonus was alive again, whether he'd
know John? Ralph laughed at the idea.
Couldn't help thinking of Bonus Court, as
I saw Nancy and her children sitting under a
cherry tree, while John was busy with the
men in the harvest field. Something of a
change  isn't it?
Lester Farm, Cattermill Farm and Marvin
Farm, are the names of three adjoining
plantations
if we may use that word, in regard
to free land, worked by free labour  and the
owners of these farms, were respectively
Charles Lester, William Marvin and John
Cattermill. After his marriage with Fanny,
Charles had purchased a tract of land in
Wiskonsan
,
and divided it into three farms. One
he presented to William Marvin, the other to
John Cattermill, and the last he reserved for
himself.
That Cattermill ain't the same man,
exclaimed
Peter. Don't you remember,
Charley, when we first met him  but three
years ago  livin' in Cincinnati, a poor,
miserable
sot, who depended on the labour of his
wife for his support? You told him to pack
up and come with you. He did that. You
giv' him an object to live for. I wish old
Bonus could rise from his grave and see John
Cattermill as he
is
not as he
was
. I do.
And Marvin, said Ralph  He told me
to-day, as we walked in the fields, that he had
looked for God in the clouds long enough.
`Now, my child,' says he, `I find him here,
in these free woods.'
And this change had been accomplished
by the agency of Charles Lester. Aroused
from the lethargy of mental disease, by his
love for the daughter of Alice Bayne, Charles
had found development for his energies, in
cultivating this tract of forest land, and in
gathering the wandering children of civilized
misery and landless toil, to a Home in the
wilds of Wiskonsan. Marvin, Cattermill and
Ralph, were by no means the only monuments
of the redemption, accomplished by his kindly
heart and active brain.
And then as the evening begins to gather,
the conversation turns upon the events of
other days.
Peter and the young husband begin to
converse
in low tones, while Ralph and the young
wife look significantly into each other's faces.
Ralph, completely transformed since we
last beheld him, presses his sister's hand,
while his chest heaves and his eyes brighten
with emotion.
Fanny, very pale and trembling, listens to
the conversation of Peter and her husband,
and silently returns the pressure of her
brother's hand.
You heard that he was living? whispers
Lester, gazing into Peter's face, as it is
warmed by the last rays of the setting sun.
Livin' and preachin'! answered Peter
14
The feller that we left hanging in the woods,
has been a preachin', not two months since,
in Fildelfy and New York. Thousands of
soulsso the papers say  have been soundly
converted under his ministry.
He is alive! ejaculated Lester: I am
glad of it! Base as he is, I would not have
his blood upon my conscience. The worst
punishment that you can inflict upon a man
like him, is to bid him live!
How did he get off the rope? That
puzzles me. It's a reg'lar sockdologer.
Shall I tell the story, Fan? whispered
Ralph to his sister.
Yes, assented Fanny, blushing and
trembling, as she felt conscious that she had
kept a secret from her husband.
Well, Peter, began Ralph, Do you
really want to know how the Preacher
escaped
?
Peter looked at him, in much surprise.
Of course, he answered  What do you
know about it?
I cut him down, quietly exclaimed Ralph.
You cut him down! was the
simultaneous
ejaculation of Charles and Peter.
Forgive me, Charles, it was my fault,
interrupted Fanny, laying her hand upon her
husband's arm: You remember
that night
,
when I rested at the stone house in the
forest
While us folks was a-hangin' the Preacher?
Yes. Go on gal, cried Peter.
Ralph came into my room, after I had gone
to bed, and told me the whole story. He told
me that not five minutes before, he had left the
miserable man, struggling with death, alone in
the dark woods. I besought Ralph to hurry
back and set him free. After much entreaty,
he consented
You had a hard time to persuade me, Fan.
But I did hurry back and cut him down, just
as he was kicking his last. And I brought
him to, and gave him some money, and sent
the poor devil on his way. Couldn't help it,
Charley: Fan begged so hard, and then it was
a shame to send him to the devil, before he
had done all the devil's work.
You are an angel, whispered Charles to
his wife, quietly pressing her hand: You
know not how many hours of painful thought
you have spared me by this deed. Ralph!
Your hand! It was a good deed, and I like
you the better for it.
Not quite sartin about its goodness, said
Peter, as if thinking aloud: I've know'd
many a rattlesnake of much better heart than
that same Preacher. Hallo, Charley! I'd
almost forgotten it. We stopped at the Post
Office on our way home. Here's a letter for
you.
Charles took the letter, and glancing at the
superscription, beheld the post-mark of
Philadelphia
.
He opened it, and held it toward the
light of the setting sun, and thus managed to
peruse its contents.
It is from a good-hearted but eccentric
friend of mine, said Charles  A singular
man, indeed, for he is a lawyer in tolerably
good practice, and withal an honest man.
Philadelphia
,
June 16, 1848.
My Dear Friend:
In answer to your enquiries, I
hasten to state the following facts which I have gained,
after some trouble, and not a little research.
Goodliegh died without heirs. His property (that is
what there is left of it) has been absorbed by lawyers,
administrators, and police officers. The State took a,
slice; another slice was swallowed by the United States
as some compensation for Goodleigh's ownership of the
Slaver, Falcon. In the course of legal investigations,
made into this little affair of Goodleigh's connection
with the Slave Trade, it appears that the foundation of
his wealth was laid in a robbery of the Rev. Lemuel
Gardiner, at a Parisian Gambling table. Lemuel you
well know had no money of his own. All that he took
with him to Paris, was stolen from the orphan children
of Arthur Bayne. You may, therefore, come to the
same conclusion with myself, in relation to THE TIN
BOX. It belongs to the aforesaid children of Arthur
Bayne. Tell Ralph to hold on to it.
Goodleigh's mansion in Drab Row has remained in
ruins ever since the fire. You have doubtless seen in
the papers some account of the manner in which an
iron chest, or rather an Iron Room, was discovered, in
the cellar, buried beneath a heap of rubbish. The door
was forced open, and two bodies, or wrecks of bodies,
were found clasped in a close embrace. They were
recognized as the bodies of Caleb Goodleigh, and
Lemuel
Gardiner. Odd kind of death for two such
worthies
don't you think so?
You make enquiries with regard to certain other
persons whom you met, during your visit to
Philadelphia
,
in 1843. Let me be at once succinct and graphic.
1.
Dicky Bung
failed in business, cheated his
creditors, and may be seen every afternoon in Chesnut
street, dressed in the last agony of fashion. Mem:
Lives by the
bones
.
2.
The Squashahogany Copper Minino Com
pany
. Died with Goodleigh. Its members gone into
other speculations.
3.
Slinkum Scissleby, Esq
. Still edits the
Daily Copper, Copper still terrible in regard to French
Novels, and prolific in obscene advertisements. You're
familiar with the natural history of the Ostrich?
4.
Stewel Pydglon, Esq
. Alas for the vanity
of human glory! Three years ago, Stewel was at the
head of a virtuous fraternity, composed of Police
Officers
,
lawyers and thieves.
Now!
Stewel's glory has
departed. Read the Public Trials in the daily papers.
Stewel is
barely
outside of the Penitentiary.
Hoping that all this, will meet with your cordial
approbation
,
I am yours, &c.
So Ralph, the tin box is yours at last!
cried Charles: You entrusted it to me,
some three years ago. I will now give it back
to you. What do you intend to do with it?
It is of course, a separate matter altogether,
from the property which you inherit in
common
with Fanny.
Ralph was silent. He grasped the hand of
Charles, and with that silent grasp, spoke the
full volume of his gratitude.
By the light of the rising moon, the party
ascended to the hill, and returned to the
log-house
,
Fanny leaning on her husband's arm,
while Ralph and Peter brought up the rear,
with young Arthur in their charge. Once
within the walls of their forest home, Ralph
drew Charles aside, and whispered The tin
box  I'd like to speak with you about it.
Charles took a light and led him into a
small room, which fitted up with some
neatness
,
served as the library. Placing the light
on a desk, which supported a small book case,
Charles opened a drawer, and Ralph presently
beheld the tin box  for the first time in five
years.
Charles watched him closely. Ralph's
visage, entirely changed from its old-time look
of precocious suffering and stolid defiance, was
agitated in every lineament. He regarded the
Tin Box for some moments in silence, his lip
quivering slightly, and his grey eyes dilating
with an intense light.
Open it Charley, he said at last.
It was opened. The bright surface of
golden coin, packed snugly in that narrow
space, glittered in the light.
Take it Ralph. It is yours. You can
leave us, and go into business for yourself.
Either here, or in some large city.
Ralph took the box and placed it under his
arm. Fifteen thousand dollars in gold and
bank notes, were now altogether his own.
He left the room abruptly and passed from the
house, followed by Charles, who did not know
what to make of his movements.
Once more in the moonlight, Ralph seized
a spade, and hurried down the path which led
to the river. When Charles next saw him,
he discovered him engaged in digging a cavity,
at the foot of a massive oak, whose wide arms
overhung the waters.
Charles watched his movements in silence.
The cavity once dug, he dropped the Tin
Box into its depths, replaced the earth and
smoothed the sod, until it looked even and
green as ever.
There Charley, he exclaimed  When
I want to leave you, and go into business for
myself, in some large city, I'll dig up that
Tin Box again. Not before.
And as they clasped hands over the grave
of the Tin Box it was resolved by Charles
and Ralph to leave it rest there, until the
year 1849, when (in case Ralph changed his
mind, and desired to leave the free forest for
the enslaved city,) it should be brought forth
to light once more.
A WORD BEFORE WE PART.
You
have now perused this Revelation of the Church
and Home. It is to the Home, that we turn for
consolation
and repose, when our feet are weary, and our
hearts are suffering. For the Home is the holiest altar
which God has reared upon the face of the earth.
Better
that all the Churches in the world were levelled to
the dust, than that the peace of one Home should be
destroyed.
But there are two persons who continually threaten
the peace and too often destroy the sanctity of Home.
The False Preacher and the False Physician.
Entrusted with the confidence of every member of
the Home, these men, every day abuse that confidence,
and reward a blind faith, with treachery and outrage.
Certain victims of the treachery of the False
Preacher and the False Physician, delineated in the
preceding pages, after many trials, survive this
treachery
and foil these traitors.
But what says the experience of every-day life?
Who shall count the families that have been
sundered
,
the children that have been cast, helpless and
stigmatized, upon the mercy of the world, the husbands
and wives that have been torn from each other, the
Homes that have been transformed into Hells, through
the influence of these Criminals of Society  The
False Preacher and the False Physician?
In these pages you have seen one member of each
class of criminals, delineated with the sincerity and the
power, that always attends an earnestly spoken Truth.
The previous work lacking the unity and compactness
of a mere Novel, has claims to be considered as a History
of Real Life.
But there are other False Preachers, there are other
False Physicians, whose crimes upon society and the
home  crimes striking at the very heart of woman's
purity and man's honor  demand a volume much
larger than the present, a pen much more powerful
than mine.
In another, and a larger work than this, the task will
be attempted.
The reader who has traced the characters of Reuben
Gatherwood and Edmund Jervis  these Iscariots who
betray the Home, as Judas sold his God  will find
other members of the same family delineated in the
pages of a larger work, more extended in its plan, more
exciting in its incidents, more comprehensive in its plot
than the Memoirs, and entitled THE EMPIRE
CITY, OR NEW YORK BY NIGHT AND DAY.
