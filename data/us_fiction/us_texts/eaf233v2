BOOK THE THIRD.
THE TIMES OF JACOB LEISLER.

Historical Illustration
.It here of a certainty becometh me to
mention that which I have heretofore delayed until the learned
reader had arrived at this part of the veracious narrative, whereto
these observations adjoin, and of a truth, rightly belong, seeing
my remarks are here most applicable; (howbeit it might
derogate
from my research, that I mentioned not the facts heretofore)
that the historie detailed in the text wandereth, adverse to the
authorities
of the time, into divers anachronisms, whereof the
existence
of the characters and events relating to the pirate Kid, and
Jacob Leisler, form a very grievous portion. Certes, the period
of the rover's exploits, and the insurrection of the Hollander,
were divided by a lapse of several years; seeing that the maritime
depredations of the first, were not perpetrated until the times of
Governor Benjamin Fletcher, and the Earl of Bellamont, who
were the successors of Colonel Sloughter, who is introduced in the
historie; nathless, there was no lack of pirates at the period
whereon
the text dwelleth in relation; and it was for the suppression of
these, that Kid was despatched as the narrative tells even in the
outset; albeit, a strict adherence to circumstances as they actually
chanced, is commendable; nathless, the narrative hath many
ensamples of deviation from the correct rule; both among
the ancients and moderns, which are needless to enumerate,
seeing no blame can attach itself to the error of chronology.
whereon I have indited this dissertation, after recalling to the
memory the liberties taken with time by the immortal and divine
Maro, in placing Dido in Africa at the time of neas, while in
reality
,
it was full three hundred years subsequent to the taking of
Troy, that the sister of Pygmalion founded Carthage.T. P.

Mar.
Thus far we have sailed and ran no risk,
Our gallant bark riding the broad billows
As proudly as e'er an eagle ploughed
The mountain air; but now we change our course;
Ho, mates, take in the main sheetset the braces
The wind doth come in a fresh point; large clouds
Gather in the heaven; we must be alert.
Now mark my wordsthere will be weather
That will rattle our rigging ere night.
The Mariner's Tale

That
the reader may draw breath as well as myself,
at every convenient stoppage of the narrative, I have
proposed, nay, determined on an experiment; to which I
now proceed; and deeming it the duty of a writer, that what
he does in his discourses with the world, he must do boldly,
as the soldier who volunteers the forlorn hope; for he
cannot
,
if he be no servile flatterer, expect to meet all
favour
he
must offend the taste of some, to please others
nay, to gratify his own;at a period of the romance
like that to which it is now brought, I have concluded
without offence, I hope,
et sans ceremonie
, to any person
concerned, to take leave of the rule, which in the latter
sections of the second book in this work, I had bound
myself to observeand, leaving the characters I have
heretofore summoned to fill my scenes, to take care of
themselves, for awhile I shall enter on a new ground,
which, however, may in the denouement, be found to
forward the progress of the main business; but in the
pursuit of this object, I feel I shall often need to
be called to orderfor a habit, which has, I have no
doubt, been a great drawback on my readers already,
still sticks to me; and is so miserably interwoven in my
nature, that I fear it will bear me out in the very last
page; it is, that reflect I mustand what is worse, I
must trouble my readers with my thoughts and
dissertations
;
and as I am now approaching a portion of the
work, to which all the former parts may appear merely
subservient, I cannot refrain (from the nature of the events
1*
which I shall be forced to detail) from frequently
remarking
on men and manners as they exist, when
compared
to them as they have once existed. There were
indeed bad men, bad deeds, and a bad world, in the
olden day, but then were the ages of barbarism and
idolatry; but for all the storied chronicles relatefor
all the pen of the historian hath tracedfor all the scorn
that is heaped on our unlettered and unpolished forbears,
I am brought to believe, and that on no weak foundation,
that the most foul crime they knew, hath its superior,
and where they had the ability to commit one vile
action
,
among us a thousand are hourly perpetrated, far
beyond what the most abandoned could have once
dreamed of; and though this be termed the age of wisdom,
of morality and religion; yet the most glaring vices,
and most atrocious criminals, stalk abroad in open day,
with upright front; and it is virtue alone, that like some
trembling and timid bird shunning the fowler's eye,
seeketh
darkness, and fearfully cowers in the shade; indeed
honesty is the
marah
, the bitter waters of the Scripture;
few love to taste it. Although perhaps the wickedness of
these times may have been exceeded in the capability of
its enactors; at least, at no period hath it ever been more
impudent and barefaced, seeming as if that, which with
our forefathers was but in the bud, hath now blown out
to its fulness: in truth, decency of behaviour is
scarcely
observed in any station of life or state of society; at
present, the higher are only distinguished from the lower
classes, by their ingenuity in roguery, and their
refinement
in debauchery: for while the ragged losel robs for a
few coppers to supply his drunkenness, the proud
gentleman
as he terms himself, filches from his friend, his
brother, his patron, thousands which he riots away on
bawds, dice and wassail; and yet there never was more
religion than now; but then, never was there less
morality
.
What a convenient garb for villany, for
hypocrisy
,
hath ever been the scapularythe black badge of
priesthood; what numbers of our divines are avaricious,
canting deceiverswho, dead to true piety, own no
spring except the strong urgings of private interest; who
have no charity for man, no heart but for themselves
no God but goldand who preach, but practise not: in
numerous instances, religion hath been made an article
of traffic, and bought and sold as though it was a mere
carnal thinga piece of merchandise formed for the
uses of man; and so it has beenfor the simple
religion
of nature, when the worshipper without the pomp
of carved altars and pillared chapelswithout the rich
bound, gilded prayer book, and the soft and crimson
cushion, poured forth in simple guise, his heart unto his
maker, hath passedand devotion hath become the
enaction
of foppery, of sleek locked bigotsof starched and
sanctified apes, who assume a meekness of heart, which
is but outward show, the covering of depravity; who talk
of lowliness, while they flutter like butterflies, proud of
their silken cloaks and snow white bands: yes, the
preacher even at the desk, seeketh not the meekness
that should become his stationbut with the heart of
the tiger, thirsting for blood, points out the way to
persecution
:
at times, yea, in the self same breath, he
talks of charity, and of death and torments to those who
differ in their creed from that to which he is bound, by
bonds of iron, of ignorance, of bigotry, of livelihood;
for often his bread depends upon spreading doctrines
which he scorns and laughs at, over his secret convivial
cupsand which he brings his false lips to utter, to
gratify
the infant minds of doting old women, and simple
girls; for such are the true supporters of the clergy.
Out on the garments of disguise! I have known one of
them, who, from the cold, stony, and frosted threshold of
his doorway, hath thrust forth even to the storm, the
scarce garbed and shivering beggar, bidding him,
unpitied
,
seek relief in the bleak winds of winter; yet he,
a pampered pauper, revelled in luxury: I have heard
his voice denounce as vile, amusements, which he
himself
slily enjoyed;away with such deception! Sad
indeed is it, that the gown should be changed to the
leper's mantle, a cloak to cover and hide vile spots,
loathsome deformities, and deadly passionsthe fierce,
revengeful hatred, and the baser frailties of weak hu
manity, and serve alike for the garb of hypocrisy and
the blackest designs. Here, however, let it be borne in
mind, that no one more venerates and respects, than the
inditer of these sentiments, true and unfeigned piety,
gentleness and devotion: but where are they to be
found? for it is too palpable to every observer,
that there are more unblushing pretenders among
the votaries of religion, than any other following; and I
must confess, I cannot endure to behold with patience or
temper, so many puritanical mountebanks impose on the
unwary multitude: wretches whom Cibber describes as
making a trade of religion, and showing an uncommon
concern for the next world, only to raise their fortunes
with greater security in this.

The Nonjuror.
Yes, from the very bottom
of my heart, I do detest this over pious species, who,
losel-like
,
fatten on the richest benefices, swelled by the
alms of the blinded, the besotted and the childish; who
riot in the plentiful contributions of the ignorant, who
are gulled out of their time and money on false pretences,
the conversion of the Hottentot or the Samoide, and who
after performing a thousand nefarious deeds unpunished,
hold up their hands, and groan in the very spiritual nasal
twang of the conventicle at the every action of another.
Again, of what consists the crowd of our civilians, but of
abandoned sharpers and needy knaves, who prowl abroad
like the insatiable hyena, seeking whom they may devour,
defiling the purity of justice with their unhallowed
doings
;
they are like that treacherous animal, who,
discontented
with its due share of food, seeks for an unguarded
moment of its master's meal with eager lip and flashing
eye, to pounce upon the dish and glut its ravenous
appetite
with all that it can prey on, watching even for the
life's blood of him who had been its fondest protector;

cat.
English Paper
.
the most vile and really weak chicanery are allowed to
overcome
right, and men are oftener robbed of life or fortune
by the incorrectness of a word than by truth and justice;
and it is this that makes the law the villain's refuge and
the honest man's bane; for judges pride themselves more
on giving ear to the letter of the law, the meaning of a
word, a technical form, or rather, as it is called, legal
knowledge
,
which closes the hearing though it may sharpen the
sight, than the voice of evidence, and the facts in dispute;
and it is seldom but the most perfidious and villanous of
mankind, on the most frivolous subtities and the flimsiest
subterfuges, escape even though clearly detected, their
deserved punishment. Such is the law; a base and wilful
false swearing, though it may be the ground of misery, of
ruin, and of misfortune, is not a punishable perjury if it
be not material to some frivolous point on trial. Out on
these childish forms, the legal trickeries that do, by
shielding the wicked and the profligate, destroy honor,
honesty and truth! And farther, if a man be a politician,
a follower of the ruling party of the day, in this part of
the world, he is amenable to no offence; it is true, if his
conduct be too flagrant to be glossed over, or to smother
from public indignation, the mockery of an investigation
is gone through; but it is a flimsy fiction to cheat the
multitude, and, by bringing forth the offender pure and
unspotted, give him new opportunities to pursue his
atrocities
with impunity. I have beheld one man ascend the
judgment seat (but him we all know
[3]
[3]
I have remarked divers metaphors of knowledge, or rather,
licenses
of the kind whereon I now write, in the text in the course of
the historie; albeit I have not been enabled to meet success in my
investigations
thereon; natheless, I have an idea, from the period of
the narrative, and divers similitudes, that this instance meaneth the
famous Jeffries, a judge in the time of James the Second, howbeit
it may have reference unto Dirk Van Rikettie, or some one who
beareth an extreme likeness unto him in the text.
T. P.
) to set on trial of a
felon, so afterwards convicted, accused of wilful perjury,
whose hand, as though a dear friend, he had clasped a
moment before the opening of the court, though, let it be
remembered, an indictment had long been found, and, as
may be supposed from this, care was taken that sentence
never should be passed upon the culprit; for why? he was
influential at the poles, at an election. Aye, this very
judge, I have been told, and have cause to believe it,
with the same breath hath encouraged the rogue, and the
honest man hath he denounced; the popular cry with him
is the law, he would kiss the feet of a leper, drink the
gutters
dry, steal, murder, for men in power; indeed he is a
fair allegory of the fabled figure that crowns the
building
wherein he has a seat being blind of one eye; but
his blind side hath a certain cure the instant he feels it
the strongest. But this man has some virtues that are
not to be denied; he can with such good nature,
apparent
rectitude, and unblushing confidence decide a cause,
or rather a point of law, at one hour in one manner,
and a different time in another; and has so many
authorities
,
unknown to any other jurist, at command, that it
confirms
the idea, there is more talent required to be an
honest
man than a knave; in a word, through the artifices
of rogues like this man, who seek for protection or
service
from their power, the law hath become so
overburthened
with rotten statutes, that it hath grown rather an
oppression than a safeguard to those who honestly have
recourse to it, and who really may be termed with some
propriety, in the words of a writer whose name has
escaped
me, patients, rather than clients. Indeed the law
is like some huge umbrageous tree, rooted in discord,
loaded and almost weighed down by innumerable dead
and dying branches and withering foliage, and which
cannot
again flourish until fairly trimmed by the skilful knife
of the woodman; but which, left longer unimproved, will
become unfit for aught but the forest axe to level, and to
he hewed from the roots for the fire; or perhaps the law
may be better likened to some old, scarce inhabited tower,
the home of the bat, the night owl and the rook; a tall
pile whose roof is matted o'er with withering flowers, and
whose blackened visage proclaims the lapse of years, the
wrecks of man, the changes dire which time effects and
his dark servant deaththe extent of whose ruined
apartments
is scarce known to its possessors, who still, with
mad fondness, dwell on amid the dust and the lumber of
ages; amid the gloom of its wide halls, which scarce feel
like the dwelling of man, but rather his sepulchre;
disdaining
the social and convenient comforts of a neat
modern
mansion for an ancient rookery, which hath nothing
to recommend it except veneration for the moss and ivy,
which like some creeping thing of life, hath glided up the
crumbling wall, and, with its green and smiling visage
carpeting the cold brown stone, o'er which a hundred
winters had spent their fury, seeming like some tender
and youthful child embracing its aged ancestor, and
bespeaking
its antiquity. And to pursue the inquiry of this
subject, the state of the times, let me ask what now is the
man of medicine, but a conceited empirick, a mere fop
of pill and glister, a self-be-puffed pedant, swelling and
bristling with ignorance and his own lofty pretensions to
importance? though as to knowledge, more exact in the
set and knot of a neckcloth than in the beat of a fevered
pulse, or the means to allay a throbbing templethere is
one of this species, the very buffalo of his breed, a huge,
strapping creature, as empty as a hogshead of all except
arrogance and presumption, by whose unmerited success,
the minor followers of the lancet trim their course and
fashion their manners; troth, he is a very mother
All-flesh
,
in bulk and intellect; heavy, vastly heavy, alike in wit
and countenance; he hath the amplitude and features of
a bull, fattened by high feeding, and looketh the square
compound of every sense, except that which is the most
wanted; he is the very humbug and jest of notoriety,
pleased with the rattle of a child and the dividing of a
straw, his whole study is to thrust himself into celebrity,
in the very face of public opinion; and to build his own fame
he taketh every mean method; the suppression of the
honours, and the name of another is of little consequence if
it interferes with his plans; a servile press his organ, he
crams his absurdities upon the world, which, surprised at
his impudence, scarce knows whether to resent it or
despise
the vain apewho makes his admirers, not by his
talents, but his feasts; for indeed in what doth this
creature
excel? with a lamb's heart and a sheep's head, he
is superior in but one quality, selfishnessan utter
disregard
to every principle except his own views; and that
the ideas of a physician on this are equal to any other
intriguer's
is not to be doubted, when we remember how
the public purse hath been fleeced by these preservers
of health, when we recall the successive experiment of
that famous botanist and lucky alchymist, who turned a
garden of rotten herbs and stinking weeds to gold, by
means alone of a broad face of brass.

This is obtuse, and I am not able to give an assured or
accurate
illustration, howbeit, I have made divers researches among the
doings of ancient chemists and philosophers, and peradventure I
have perused numerous learned works, that treateth of
transmutation
of metals and other inanimates, nathless, without success,
therefore, I have concluded, that this referreth unto a mere
botanical
experiment,

And to proceed,
what in reality are all these scientific, historical,
graphical
,
philosophical, and charitable societies, but so many
respectable names for associations of gourmands and
topers? What single assistance hath been derived by the
student from their frequent revels, save there be science,
virtue, or learning in dissipated habits, and the practice
of horrid acts of debauch; the foundation of such
institutions
,
says Addison, are on eating and drinking: the
vulgar
and the ignorant are modest, they gulp their drams
in secret and alone, but it is the pride of learned men to
guzzle in crowds, and show their gluttony to the world,
to fill the journals of the day with their pleasantries in
their cups, in the shape of hackneyed sentiments, whose
dullness not even wine can enliven, and which, in
numbers
,
are an army of compliments, that drunken rivals
belard
each other with, so that the hardest skull would be
fairly cracked, e'er one could get half through with a
glass to each; indeed, it is now considered as an
extraordinary
annunciation to state, that at such festals `all
things went off with proper and becoming decorum,'
which, in plainer language, signifies that no thick headed
professor
Without dubitation, this is an irreverend and wicked scandal
against learned and erudite men, and hath assuredly offended my
sight in the text, nathless, the inditer would not consent to an
erasure thereof, and therefore I was fain to assent (albeit, it is
needless to repeat reluctantly,) to its remaining, even as it was
originally
written, taking an argument of solace unto myself that no
share of the offence was mine, howbeit, the world knoweth the
untruths wherewith we, who are of a studious and searching
nature
,
are assailed by the vulgarnathless, I will remark unto my
ingenious associates my reasons for permitting this vituperation
against them, peradventure the inditer being strenuous in his
determination
,
I feared that in some portions of the narrative, whereon I
had set my heart, seeing there is somewhat on lewd fashions,
play-house mummery, and charlatanism, which might apply unto
the follies of the present period, whereof I doubted he might have
taken an ill-will, and have thwarted my wishes for its continuance
in the text, therefore I submitted unto his requisition, believing as
teacheth that brilliant luminary, Sir Thomas More, some sick
men will take no medicine unless some pleasant thing be put amongst
their potions, although, perhaps it be somewhat hurtful; yet the
physician suffereth them to have it. So because many will not
hearken to serious and grave documents, except they be mingled
with some
fable
or jest, therefore reason telleth us to do the like.

got so beastly drunk that he was obliged to be
carted home at midnight; or that no tunbellied alderman
(which sort of cotton bales are always ex-officio honorary
members of philosophical associations, probably owing
such dignified preferments to the profound knowledge
which these venerable worthies ever discover at carving
the best portion of a public contract for themselves, as
well as the breast or wing of a goose; or otherwise the
honour may be a matter of course, granted out of respect
to the nautical skill shown by the `grave signors,' in
steering clear of fines and sequestrations, when they break
the laws they help to enact) gave in of a surfeit at the
fourth course, in evident fear of bursting, though
doubtless
,
there is more
heading
than
hooping
wanted among
such rioters; still they are fully on an equality with those
companies who are ostensibly congregated for benevolent
purposes; for from them (natheless their apparent object,)
what hath the sick or poor benefitted? there are as many
destitute, sinking unrelieved in want and disease as
before
such societies existed; the tavern and the wine
cellar hath truly gained by them, but it is a question if
ever the lazar hath been bettered a meal from their
banquets
,
the exercises of which are pretty much the same
with those celebrated by order of the Macedonian
conqueror
at the funeral pyre of Calanus, a combat of hard
drinkers, of whom it is related, nearly forty died on the
Vol. II. 2
spot, from the power of the grape, and he who triumphed
did scarce survive his hard got victory the brief space of
thirty-six hours.

Qu gloria est capere multum? Cum penes te palma fuerit, et

Senec. Epist.

.
Such being the performances of those
who call themselves the learned and respectable, what can
be expected from the herd who must follow in their wake,
but that they are equally contaminated, and alike dissolute.
There is not a single occurrence that is not tainted with
vileness and abandoned knavery; your very neighbour,
nay, your dearest friend chuckles delighted, if for the
value
of a farthing he can cheat you; and thinks it a rare
jest to tell his cunning to your face, and laugh at your
credulity. All is overreaching duplicity, and the more
apparent the sharper, the more barefaced the rogue; the
more the man is lauded: and he who fairly hath in justice
won the halter, and from which it would be hard to rescue
him in any other country, is the one who is most trusted,
finds the most defenders, and indeed, in the world's
opinion
,
stands the clearest. His rogueries are quoted by
the admiring crowd as specimens of talent, his hair-breadth
escapes from the clutches of the law are but passports of
respectability. But it must be remembered these remarks
are qualified; for the knave must be a rich one; that as
well as he hath preserved his neck, he hath kept his
plunder; for `an he be a poor rogue' the Lord help him,
he will find himself as bad off as an honest man. But that
the city of our residence is crowded with characters
as described, may in one wise be accounted for, since it is
the great mart of adventure, where all the itinerant
vagabonds
of the continent gather
en masse
, for the sake of
pushing their fortunes, or, rather, of preying on those of
better folks. To one point they flock like a flight of
carrion
crows about a corpse, determined to devour; without
a solitary dollar, they look for maintenance in the pockets
of others; upon nothing, except an eager wit, barefaced
assurance, and hungry stomachs, they set out, and with full
purses, swaggering consequence and arrogant pride, as
might be expected from their means, do they end their
journies of adventure. Here comes a troop of half-starved,
beggarly, breechless, ragged, lean, long-necked Yankee
lawyers, schoolmasters, pedlars, and what not, who in all
probability have to a man been drummed out, or whipped
through every town of their own states, ready to cheat,
rob, lie, or talk for any body that will employ them. Firm
in bad principles, and determined to push onwards, is it
to be wondered that the lawyer, who had at home tended
pigs, fed poultry, sowed pumpkins, and skinned onions, in
a little while is elevatednot to the gallows, oh, no! but
to the bench of the judge, or a seat in the hall of congress,
for where could the populace find a more convenient
representative
,
or one more willing to slave for his
constituents
,
so as he makes his own fortune. The
schoolmaster
,
who used to sit, and deem it an honour too, in a
corner of the deacon's kitchen, where he was on board,
and sleep in the garret, among rats, old boots, broken
spinning-wheels
,
dust, draperies of dried peppers, peaches, and
molasses jars, is metamorphosed into an impudent
office-hunter
,
boastful of his services and his pretensions, or a
corrupt scribbler, with a pen for all occasions, and for every
party that may believe him worth the purchasing. And
lastly, the pedlar, whose whole employment had been to
take in the `fellers and gals' with trumpery baubles, whose
best meals were the charity of the farmers where he
stopped
,
Indian pudding baked beans, `sarse, and innards,'
whose happiness had been to rest in a barn upon straw, or
among the corn-stalks, and whose highest ideas had been
to mount the horse which he stole from his customers, or
to sit on the ducking stool; this creature is changed in
a short period, by the prosperous trade of deception and
knavery he has pursued, to the lofty nosed merchant,
who would fain carry his head as high as the mast of one
of his own ships; the cock-sparrow of the exchange,
whose capital is the credit he can obtain from all the fools
who are eager to trust him; and there are no lack of these,
for heaven knows there are five times as many who would
put confidence in, and lend money to a knave, a sheet
rascal, than a poor honest man; for in truth, it is no
wonder
,
it is more satisfactory; for at once you are acquainted
with what you are to expect, for the latter can and will
only pay you as he is able, which is oftentimes giving a
long time, while the former, like an upright fellow, puts
you straightway out of all misery, by telling you `you
are an impolite dog to ask any thing of a man of honour,
who condescended to receive your paltry goods, and since
you are so importunate, he'll be damn'd if he ever pays you
at all; you may sue an you likewho cares a jot? no
one need trouble himself while there is a Recorder and
an Insolvent Act in New-York.' Thus do these men
vaunt, and while they push themselves into consequence,
gentility, and even power, the good citizen, the
gentleman
,
who seeks for happiness in retirement, or as virtue
is always backward, is too modest to thrust himself,
whatever
may be his just claims, on public favour, remains
neglected, his very existence unknown, without influence
or name; while yet these creatures, usurping his place
in the community, the scum of dirt and impurity, the
origin of the kennel, still unwashed and rank with filth,
all flimsiness and vapour, obtrude themselves with giant
airs in every public business of importance: is a
committee
formed to encourage some noble national object, are
the names you read of such committee, men of worth or
respectability? No. they are these self-imposed,
self-nominated
chaps, who take care by a ready out-a-door cut
and dried plan, to figure in the public prints, in places
where worth, honesty, integrity, respectability and
learning are wanted, and ought to have been. If a
station
,
no matter what, be vacant, though it be one that
demands
men of the choicest to uphold, it is sure to be first
sought after by these blood suckers: indeed, so
unparalleled
is their audacity, that the good have become inert
and indifferent; and these have been besotted with
success, and really begin to believe themselves the mighty
personages they would be, and of that moment, that the
world without their aid, would come to a dead stop; and
they break out on the astonished natives, with all the
airs of a jay, when disguised in the peacock's plumage.
Away with such upstarts! these great little menthese
time serving, dirt born objects of self-conceited
mightiness
these
insignificant, detestable parasitesfaithless
to every virtue, and undeserving of the name of man.
The influence arising from the laxity of morals, that has
been treated on, is most severely felt in the decay it
brings to the very heart of the social virtues; there,
indeed
,
it strikes home, and no barrier can be raised against
the attack: as the customs of the day become
contaminated
,
all must alike be injured; and even women,
lovely
women, whose primeval brightness is as beautiful as
the sunny blossoms of the laburnum wound in a chaplet
for the brows of Spring, is touched with the fatal spirit,
and is fast casting away all that adorned her, as she
would a yoke of slavery; for that which delights her
ear, and is termed by its professors a strain of innocent
gallantry, is but a scarce veiled tirade of shameless
licentiousness
:
and it appears as if all a female now aims
at is to be noticed by the crowd, either for the richness
or the singularity of her dress; it is not a difficult thing
to be singular, says the Abbe Le Blanc, persons need
only push their character, whatever it be, to excess, and
have no regard to decencyand on this principle, do
the ladies of the day act; to spend hour after hour at
the toiletteto dress so as to be mistaken for the painted
bawds of the brothelto parade the streets with no
earthly object, but to gratify their vanity and be seen
to discourse or laugh so loud, as to attract all eyesto
toss their heads affectedlyto utter affected phrases and
conceited wordsto read novels filled with lack-a-daisical
sentimentalities; these, and no more are needed, to
make an accomplished belle; and these are the pleasant
amusements of the most fashionablewho plume
themselves
on being the mirrors of elegance and manners.
However, that a want of delicacy should be theirs, is not
surprising, when we behold among their evening resorts,
the playhouse takes a conspicuous stationfor what but
ill can arise from frequenting the very hot bed of vice
the building within whose walls debaucbery is licensed,
and immorality is countenanced? the theatre hath had
2*
its enemies, and its hired defenders; the good and ill
effects of the drama, hath been often pointed out,
oftentimes
cried out unto the heedless world, who care not,
in the search for enjoyment, whether the grasp is good
or evil: suffice it to say, on the one point, no man of
reason can be an enemy to the dramaI mean the
written
works of geniusthe perusalthe honest
enaction
of some of which, if it were withheld from the
world, would be a loss to virtue, of lessons more
powerful, more impressive, than a thousand homilies
from the lips of paid preachers; but it is the mimics,
the charlatans, the performers, and the fashion of the
enaction, that every moral man should condemn; in
these consist the danger, and the causes for which
the theatre should be shunned, even as a pest-house,
where disease and death is to be received. What
is the life of an actor? drunkenness, debauchery, harlotry
and dissipation of every kind. Who are these men?
vagabond
strollers at first, characters of the most desperate
description, who have had but one choice, the highway
or the stage. Enter into the walls, and behold the
passing
scene:can any female who hath the least feeling or
modesty, nay, can a man, who is not lost to every sense
of right and shame, look on without his very soul being
harrowed up in disgust and indignation. Behold yon losel,
his eye yet glaring with the late wassail, while the paint,
necessary to the character he has assumed, can scarce
disguise the parched and sallow cheek his long life of
dissipation
hath left him: still, though before an audience,
doth he believe himself in the brothel, and the chaste
diction
of the poet doth deform with interpolations and actions
which, though it may please the swine who herd in the
pit and gallery, sickens the sight, and is not fit for man or
woman, who are not outcasts, to hear or look upon. And
then, is there a drinking house about the purlieus of the
town where there is more riotous revelry, or more
encouragement
,
open and unbridled by law, for youth to be led
astray. A portion of the building is set aside for the sale
of every liquor, and for the exhibition of ladies of easy
virtue, and these are in the very glance of the fair and
virtuous dames who frequent the house, and who, be as
fastidious as they may, cannot turn their eyes, lest they
should be blasted with lewd and lascivious actions that
would cause the blood to rush warm to their brows, while
their cheeks glow with crimson, like the sun-touched
nectarine
.
On one ground, the defenders of the stage have
plumed themselves, that there have been females who have
followed it as a profession, who have been virtuous;this
may be, but the examples are so rare they can scarce be
designated, and the very boast of it discovers how few
there are, and the poorness of this defence. This opinion
on this matter is not the formation of an hour; I have had
the opportunity, and my remarks have facts, `stubborn
facts,' to found their sentiments upon; the very nature of
an actress' life is such that she must be a woman of little
honour:for what modest female would expose herself
before
the sight, the rude and daring eyes of thousands, and
bear the remarks, and the examination, of the sensualist
and the debauchee; for their amusement assume dresses,
habits unbecoming her sex, and even common modesty.
The courtezan will not expose herself in the light, but
here, women pretending virtue deck themselves in worse
attire than the livery of harlots and prostitutes; then, the
scenes that are gone through with, should be as
abhorrent
to a female as to a male:the liberties allowed and
taken in the view of hundreds, such as none who felt for
herself would admit for mines of wealth; then, the
allowances
presumed to follow naturally from the public
conduct
,
in secret must be such, are such as to leave but little
doubt that it is impossible for a woman who has respect
for herself to be an actress, or to follow the stage for
a livelihood; and these ideas are confirmed by every
printed life of women of this class to be found. Ought,
then, such a place to be encouraged as a resort? The
brothel of infamy should be preferred to the stage, which
is alone prostituted to show off bawds, drunkards, and
gambling sharpers. And do not those who encourage
impurity
by resorting to the home of charlatry, soon feel the
ill effects:it is the rock whereon youth is wrecked oftener
than any other that can be shown; it leads to drunkenness,
gaming, and every other wickedness. There have been
formed societies to suppress vice; they will persecute the
poor wretch who steals for his bread, and yet the very
root of crime is maintained, the abode of sharpers,
dissipation
and ruin; for there is an enchantment about the
theatrebeauty that is to be bought, and riot that can be
pursued; the apprentice will rob his master, the child his
parent; the husband hath taken the labour of the day to
gain him admission, while at home his family are wanting
food; a few years beholds the first an inmate of a
prison; the second a poor lost wretch, discarded from
his home, and begging for money to obtain liquor, that
all reflection may be drowned in its overwhelming
influence
;
the last the pander of some brothel, while
the sod covers the broken heart of his wife, and his
innocent and unfortunate offspring are scattered on the
bosom of the cold and pitiless world. Nor in addition to
the theatre, is there much obtained by the visiting of
public places, and festal routs and dances, in the manner
which they are now conducted; where lascivious
coquetry, is termed an innocent flirtationwhere to be
in perfect mode and full dress, for a female, is to be
attired
in unblushing indecency, that attracts the wanton
gaze of the multitudewhere every thing between the
sexes appears an easy familiaritywhere practice
supercedes
persuasion, and prudence gives way to a wish
to be admiredwhere, rather than not be noticed, an
indelicate display of figure, and a flagrant violation of
decorum, may be resorted to, without attracting an
indignation
on the audacious exhibition, but rather a flood
of praise, at either the grace, ease or agility, with which
the being who degrades herself for such celebrity,
performs
her part, the only merit of which is, the gross
exposure
of her person, at which modesty shudders, and
the feelings revolt in shame and sorrow, but which is
alone felt by the timid spectator: but it is needlessit is
a mere waste of labour, to speak on subjects which there
is neither care nor inclination to reform, and which,
though vices, are admired, are patronised, and reckoned
virtues; which it is the fortune of their possessors to
practise, and which, ere the mind, so besotted is it, can
be weaned from, and modesty come in fashion, an entire
new race must arise, with different examples, and
different
principles, as their standards of action. Such are
the effects of modern fashions, and improved and
polished
customsfar otherwise were those of the days
which are treated of in the pages of this narrative;
however wickedness lurked concealed in the heart, it
dared not boldly rush on the gaze; and although it
must be confessed, the practices of villany were not
uncommon, yet honest virtue was admired, and
sometimes
showed its face, a thing now rare and
unremembered
.
It was early on the evening of the day which the
traveller parted from his companions and preservers,
that a throng of persons were assembled in the
principal
apartment of the governor's house, which was situated
in the interior of Fort Willem Hendrick, or as it was then
most properly called, Fort Orange, or Aurania, the
principal
defence of the city of New-Yorke: this building was
one not only ancient but of considerable splendour and
sizeand although in the present time, its low walls and
pannelled wainscot would have been derided as scarce
comporting with the dignity fit for the dwelling of a man
whose notions were the least extensive, or who bore his
head among the dashing part of the community, yet at the
period written of, this same house was considered a
complete
palacea wonder of architectureand together with
the new City Hall and prison, which was situated at
Coenties
Slip, the ornament of the great city; it was a broad
square building of stone, painted yellow, with fine gravel
walks the whole length of the house, and a huge wide
entry, with a double door, and a brazen, snake-twisted,
and lion-headed knocker, lustrous with cleaning; its
situation was commanding; it was placed on the brow of
the hill, on whose rugged sides the white washed walls
of the wooden bastions, bristling with demi sacker, falcon
and culverin, ran like an encircling serpent almost to the
edge of the water, where in sight its white sails trembling
in the early twilight, glided along some fleeting periauger
bound on its northern river voyage, or where lay at silent
anchor on the undulating waves, their black masts
shadowing
the surface, a whole fleet of yatchen that had made
the port, and were hastening to moor beside the Capsey
[6]
[6]
This was the extreme point of the land which divided the north
and east rivers, and was about the centre of the present battery.
and the protecting docks and Rounduyten,
There were several fortified rounduyten, that constituted the
defence of the city along the east river side.
like a brood of
young wild fowl hieing to nestle beneath the sheltering
wing of the parent bird. On one side, at a distant point,
the dusk and vapour of the night, whose shadows were
fast spreading around, bounded the prospect, so that the
wide river and the dark clouds were mingled as it were
in one element. At another view, yet nearer to the eye,
were spread the bleak, rugged and desolate land of
Pavonia
,
its hills chequered with tracks of snow, and the
bare brown soil which the bright rays of the day, that
was now fleeting, had uncovered; and close under the
shadow of the beach could be seen the long dark lines of
ice that skirted its shores, like the chain about a captive,
looking stern, cheerless and wintry, unmoved by the
departing
beams of the light that lingered longest on them,
and played on the cold and frozen visage of the gelid
waters, like the faint smiles that cross the brows of the
dying ere the last departure; while, yet nearer, almost in
the centre current of the stream, borne by the quick and
nervous tide, floated onwards with a noise like the hissing
of a serpent, huge fragments of the frozen wave, that
often in their instant-shaped masses bore pieces of bark
that had been peeled by the wind from off the lichen or
the fir that waved on the stern and rocky sides of the
stoney point, or on the towering heights of the pallisadoes,
and which, ere another morning's brightness was born,
were dashed about, atoms on the foaming and giant waves
of the ocean, or were weltering amid the breakers that wash
the beach of the last island that stands the uttermost link
between the world of waters and the huge continent; even
like the race of lifefor how incredible doth it seem that
the infant nurtured in the soft luxury of the tropics should
moulder in death, after the storm of existence, amid the
snows of some polar region. On the other side, close
under the battlements of the fort, lay the city; its dark
and crowded houses; its close, narrow streets; its wharfs;
its magazines, all huddled in one mass, like some great
hive, filled with life and riches. A strange diversity,
however
,
did that hill (from whence the ancient governors of
the province looked on their metropolis) still stand would
present itself to the sight, now street on street, spire on
spire, to the very stretch of vision, would have burst on
the sight; the smoke of thousands of dwellings would
have been seen curled in the blue sky; the masts of
mighty shipping pennon on pennon; the hum of
commerce
,
which then to have been dreamed of would have
been believed a tale of magic; the rolling and rattling of
numerous vehicles, like sounds of distant thunder, would
have broke upon the ear, and the thought and eye would
have been lost in the vastitude of all on which it turned;
while, then one might have counted every dwelling, and
have repeated the names of the inmates; for at one gaze
every principal object was apparent. Here rose the
belfries
of the churches, built in the true Duch taste, and
shaped after the fashion of the oil jars of Zwannerdam;
there was the tiled roof of the Stadhuys, the grandest
building in the colony, and, by the best informed worthy
of the Manahadoes, said to be only exceeded in the world
by the building devoted to the same purpose at
Amsterdam
;
there was, also, the wooden spire of the Borse, an
edifice likewise in great estimation, being indisputably the
finest of its kind, except the house of the Hanse Towns,
the glory of the Osterlingen traders of Antwerp, having a
tin weather-cock at the top, by which every New
Amsterdammer
corrected his wind when he had gone astray in
the calculation thereof, and then the long bridge, which
ran out in the public dock could be distinguished, crowded
with the groodt Burgerrecht, in their red flannel
vestcoats
,
calico morning-gowns and cocked hats, haggling
and chaffering with the swearing skippers of the
Albanisch
yatchen, remarkable for their worsted caps, the
manufacture of the knitting vrouws of Ohnewalagantle,

and their greasy leathern breeches; while not far distant
the skirts of the town were perceptible, with its wooden
block houses and palisadoes, its gates, slaughter-house,
and taverns; and then there lay the country around,
studded interchangeably with hills, commons, and swampy
kolcks that were crossed by slight plank bridges, and
bounded by innumerable wind-mills, whose huge arms
were continually waving in the wind, and the Bowerische
Laening, and gay plantagnies from the Crown point
Corlears Hook.
as far
as sight could reach.
The room in the great house, in which were the
characters
who are about to be described, was large and
spacious
,
partaking at once of the dignity and grandeur befitting
the audience chamber of the ruler of the mighty province
of New-Yorke: having great chimney places, with china
jambs, decorated with the ancient story of Abraham and
Isaac, and marvellously illustrative of other parts of
scripture
;
the walls were lined with pannelled wainscoat, of
an antique fashion, whose oaken surface shone lustrous
with wax; the ceilings were low and dark, and the
windows
wondrous wide and short, like embrasures, and the
casements were filled with small square panes of glass, of
a greenish cast, which had been brought from Bummel, in
Guilderland, for the purpose; around were hung
numerous
paintings, most of which partook of the different tastes
that had swayed the various persons who had been
masters
of this sumptuous residence: there were portraitures
of fish, and fruit, and game; of the planting and decorating
of May trees; there were country frolics, card playings,
and other drolleries of the low countries; the copies of
Gerard Dow, Jan Steen, Teniers, and Wouvermans, and
also in splendid frames shone forth the family likenesses
of most of the former Governors; the ladies in court
dresses, and tall stately caps and trim bodices, with hoop
petticoats, and waists like hour glasses, with roses in their
hands and birds on their jewelled fingers, often
representing
fair smiling eyed sheperdesses, with crooks and
ribands at their feet, and large gold pendants in their ears,
and having boys on their laps, intended for cupids, but
dressed, in spite of pinions, quiver, and darts, in ample
jerkins, with laced ruffles and points, bag wigs, and blue
silk small clothes, having also high heeled shoes, with
points curling upwards at the toe, like the prows of the
canoe of a South-Sea islander, and paste buckles, both at
the instep and the knee; while the gentlemen themselves,
with stern brows and monstrous mustachios almost
hanging
down to their starched ruffs, clad with steel cuirasses
and breast-plates, and surrounded with all the harness of
war, frowned grimly forth from the canvass; on a raised
settle in one corner, flourishing in an earthen pot, were
several beautiful tulips, from Alemaer, and some other
flowers, that were in those times the Hollander's passion;
[8]
[8]
The tulips of Alemaer were very celebrated; at an auction
in the year 1637, one hundred and twenty tulips brought the sum
of 90,000 guilders, one alone, called the Viceroy, was sold for the
sum of 4203 guilders.
tables with huge claw feet holding balls, were set out in
different parts of the well sanded floor, and a brisk fire
crackled on the clean hearth, about whose immediate
neighbourhood, partly induced by the severity of the
season
,
and partly by the attraction of its being the station of
the entertainers, most of the occupants of the apartment
had placed themselves, and the hosts themselves,
seemingly
proud of being the objects of universal attention, (for,
as is always in such cases, the guests like gay butterflies,
fluttering in the perfume of lordly flowers, hovered about
them) appeared greedily to devour the gratifying flatteries
that they were busied in pouring in their ears; and truly
they were two stately personages, bearing about them
every mark of their dignity, both in apparel and
demeanour
,
and but scantily wanting in confidence of their own
worthiness; they had equally that assumed air of
greatness
,
of lofty carriage, of solemn bearing, and that
pompous
utterance, that in modern instances is so common,
that marks our mud-born, dirt-bred, wealth-elated, and
self-created gentry, whose greatest accomplishments and
virtues consist in their living high, and keeping a splendid
Vol. II. 3
equipage; and about these there was that strained
condescension in address, that awkward affectation of
humility, and that self-sufficient, supercilious air, which
we see daily enacted in some mongrel, who, lifted up by
the ignorance of popular favour and fortuitous chance,
rather than his own deserts, puts on the garment of
authority
,
and would seem all meekness to his equals, while
his very soul is o'errun with pride and
overbearing
tyranny; and indeed such had been the fortunes of
Leisler;his unexpected rise and success, his want of
cultivation
of mind, while his wife, unused to the place in
which she found herself, and but ill adapted to play the
part which she was forced to act, that both studious to
bear the investitures of state in a becoming fashion,
naturally
,
at times, too far forgot what they had been, in
contemplating
(what every body else seemed to do) that which
they were; and if this feeling was carried to an extreme
in the bosom of one more than the other, it was in that of
the female, who was in her every action a very daughter
of Eve; and there was no lack of foundation in the
general
rumour, that she was a very devil incarnate of pride,
and where her helpmate was deficient, she, like a dutiful
spouse, was ever ready to assist himalbeit, the dame's
garb was a type of her nature, and at once bespoke her
character, for so loaded and bowed down with dress and
decoration was she, that she might have been likened to
some sumpter caparisoned steed in the pageant, bowing
and nodding his head at every step beneath the loads of
drooping plumes and embroidered ribands that adorned
itbut for a likeness, one need but look in the crowd of
these times, and we find that most of our ladies appear to
believe that every thing they need possess, are gew-gaws
and finery, and when so decked out they will be more
admired than if they had no other attractions than modesty,
virtue and good sense, things, that with many of the sex
are now of less moment than a brilliant head-dress and a
rich wreath. How little do they judge the brightest jewel
fair woman boasts, is in her purity of heart: and then
what need of artcan it excel that which heaven itself
hath made? those diamonds in her eyes, her teeth of
pearl, and lips of living rubiesso soft, so sweet, formed
alone to breathe love's own peculiar eloquence of bliss,
and enchain in wilful bondage all that listen to the music,
that gathers a deeper witchery from the pass that shapes
it. But while treating on this subject dame Leisler
is disregarded: a want of respect and a degree of inattention
which it is well are committed under the present
circumstances
,
for had it happened otherwise, and in the days of
the matron, it would have been long ere forgiveness was
granted to a crime which she would have considered of the
greatest magnitude, and which it would have gone far did
she not resent with a withdrawal of all her good graces and
favour from the presumptuous offender. But ere that
homage
of description is rendered unto her appearance
that it so well demanded, it behoves for the information
of the reader to premise, lest he be startled at what he
might deem incongruous, if not ridiculous in the fashion
of the times whereof this is written, that it should be
remembered
that those days were not as now, when scarce
an hour passes ere with indifferent eye we behold the dark
prow of some foreign bark laden with the silks, and
cloths, and furs of countries which are divided from us by
a thousand leagues of ocean, seeking our wharves; when
the gaudy mantles and the lace-trimmed dress, the very
likeness of those which hung on the white shoulders of
the luxurious beauties of the European capitals but a few
days before, are to be obtained from the hands of our own
tradesmen, who need not encouragement in their
extravagance
or their wanton profuseness of expense, however
adverse to the boasted simplicity of our manners, which a
few uninformed, prejudiced fools trumpet alike with the
purity of our government and institutions, which are all the
same, cankered and rotten. For what lack we in corruption
more than the ancient world? younger we are, it is true, but
not the less matured in vice, although we want the means
the unbounded riches that are possessed by the
hereditary
courtiers and titled sycophants, against whose
sumptuousness
of living, whose idle debaucheries, whose
wanton
waste of wealth we are inveighing so bitterly; yet, is
not our crowd made up of the same materials, if not of a
worse kind? Doth not our petty dignitary of a day,
though rank with native littleness of soul, in all except the
gratification of his own desires, ape in furniture, in show,
the pride, the habit, and, as far as able, the prodigal
expenditures
of the most vile and lavish of the old
metropolises
?
We read, as if in wonder, of the gaudy finery of
some foreign gala; the brilliant and costly garbs; the
jewelled head dress whose purchase were a fortune; and
many say,thank God, we have not such extremes of
unmeasured
possession and abject poverty. Ye are blind
ye are besottedye are ignorant of your own natures;
for look at homelook to yourselves, behold the staring
finery of your wives, your daughters. You are not rich
can you afford this? the soft carpets, cushioned and
gilded couches, magnificent dwellings, with all their
priceless
decorations which surround you, and which so plainly
speak that, were there an ability with you to carry things
to the same extent that you have appeared to contemn,
there were no need of desire. And then it should be
recollected
that if some expend in the great cities (to which
our eyes are always bent, in spite of our pretended
consequence
in our own superiority) their countless gold in
banquets, follies, riots and eccentricities, there are many
blessed from birth with education, liberal views and tastes,
(things that, from our very situation, our great men being
but a part of the dregs of society, narrow in principle,
devoted
to dishonesty and their own interests, are very
rare among us;) who extend the open hand unto the
deserving
;
who foster talent and encourage virtue, and
whose pride seems to be that of exalting to merited praise
the land which they inhabit? Let us not talk of freedom,
of virtue beyond our fellowswe have no real freedom,
no real virtue. Man is the same, though born in the
splendid and luxuriant chambers of a kingly palace, or
drawing breath in the cities of the new world; the same,
I mean, in ambition, in pride, in weakness; though the
first hath the advantage of being accustomed from the
cradle to a lofty station, while the latter carries in his
place the ignorant vanity and assumption of superiority,
natural to little minds suddenly elevated, together with
all the despicable ignorance of early education. And
further
,
what do we see so heinous in the actions of the
young or old of the nations from whence came our
ancestors
.
Are the women of Gaul more given to looseness of
manners, or to actual immodesty and lasciviousness than
our own? there may be with us less openness of character,
more disguise, more cloaked hypocrisy, but there is little
difference as to true virtue, where the very churches are
the concerted places of criminal design. Are the men of
England more given to the gambling table, the race course
or the wassail than our own; it is true from our situation,
fortunes cannot be sported at a single cast of the dice,
for fortunes are but rare; but are there not hosts of
sharpers, jockeys and drunkards in every sphere of our
society. Look at the flushed cheek, the feverish lip, the
blood-shot eye, yea, the premature old age of our youth,
their early graves, if proof be wanted of dissipation. Go to
the brothel, the stews, the tavern and the play-house, they
are crowded with reckless, beardless boys, rioting and
drinking; rushing onwards, unrestrained by their weak
guardians, to embrace loathsome disease and death. But
it was otherwise in the olden day of the province; there
were then but few chances of imitation of the grandeur of
the European; for often six long and wearying months
would slowly take their flight, and, many times, a year
has gone by without one adventurous vessel laving her
sides in the waters of the Hudson, having crossed the far
sea from the mother country; and when she did come
crowds, nay, the whole town would assemble, and look
on her hardy navigators in astonishment; question on
question would be sought from the master down to the
cabin boy, and all would be mad with rumour and news,
from the fort of Aurania to Herman Rutger's brew house;
the very mariners themselves were gazed on as strange
menbeings of another species; who had seen distant
countries, who had eat and drank beyond seas, and who,
above all, had seen the king. From the discourse of
such, from rude description and the ventures brought by
these, were the fashions of the province set; which, first
being sported by the dames of the big house in the fort,
3*
went from them by degrees to the damsels of the Holy
Land, and, now and then, would intrude in the house of
some Dutch burgher, and mix with the old, unvarying,
established habits, which had been left to ya vrouw by her
moeder, who probably had inherited them from her
moeder's
moeder; so that it was in nowise uncommon on
great occasions to behold the matrons of Nieuw
Amsterdam
decked out in garments that liberally partook of the
fashions of Holland, England, France, and Spain, all united
in motley assemblage on the shoulders of one person,
and very seldom did these parts, as it may be supposed,
agree either in colours, or were they of the same century,
and although this incongruity would not be
inapplicable
to the dress worn by ladies at present, which
often, so they be very showy and fine, have but little
regard to being suitable to the modesty, figure, or
character
of the wearerhow these remarks are relative to
the attire of Dame Leisler, which I was about to treat on,
the reader himself will be the best judge; for truly she
was decorated up to the eyes in all that was then
considered
splendid, and as is now termed `respectable among
the fashionables,' that is, she looked as if she was
somebody
;
for she was a woman on whom almost any thing
might be put, and it would be `vastly becoming, and
amazingly genteel;' indeed, as is vulgarly said, she was
an armful: built like a herring hoy, or a Dutch dotkin,
measuring more round the waist than she appeared to
have in height, with a little red nose, as brilliant as a
ruby, small sparkling eyes, and cheeks shining like a
kitchen maid's, and a chin hanging like a bladder, while,
to increase such charms, on her head she wore a huge,
monstrous, crisped and curled powder tower, which
supported as it was, looked like a lighthouse built
upon a mile stone, or rather a church steeple on the
top of a hogshead; her face, moreover, after the style
(ludicrous enough; but what will not fashion do?)
that had, but a short period before, reigned generally
among the ladies of the English Court, was literally
seamed
and depatched with sundry pieces and strips of black
sticking plaister, representing in varied forms, coaches
and horses, half-moons and stars, all placed, however, by
her tirewoman in an artful manner, to set off the sly darts
cast by Cupid, by means of winning smiles and dimples,
that, with the most delightful expression, always, (
except
in certain moments, which usually chanced when
she and her husband were undisturbed with the presence
of a third person,) lighted up her jovial visage; added to
what has been already particularized, was a gown of flame
coloured brocade, somewhat faded it is true, but amply
figured and flowered with monstrous tulips, Dutch pinks,
and staring roses; and then her waist was set off with an
enormous stomacher, and although her sleeves scarcely
reached to her elbows, yet the richly laced and highly
worked ruffles that depended therefrom, hung nearly to the
end of her fingers, while there was not a portion,
however
diminutive, of her attire, but was flaunted with gay
furbelows and ribands of a bright calico colourthus
decorated
and adorned, it is no wonder that her husband,
poor man, on this occasion as in many others, sunk in the
scale of comparison, for though there was not much
difference
in similitude of figure, he being a broad backed,
heavy moulded looking man, yet in movement she had
comparatively the advantage, for she glided about her
room of audience, among the swarm of Dutch damsels
assembled, like a shining gold fish, swimming round
his glass prison; nevertheless, it must be confessed,
she forgot not her elevation for a moment, for she bore
her body in such action with the true air of
condescension
and grandeur and indeed carried her head loftily,
with a neck, as is vulgarly described, as stiff as a poker
On the other hand, Jacob Leisler, as it should have
been before remarked, amid all his strained authority,
wore to the inquiring eye, a certain look of care and
uneasiness, that in spite of the inflated mightiness with
which he acted, and which he doubtless supposed
necessary
to create respect among his followers evidently
tortured
him; and labouring under such feelings his heavy
countenance showed his mind abstracted, and often his
thoughts wandered from the scene before him to the hopes
on which he lived, and to the gathering clouds which were
rolling towards him: the disappointments and defection of
his partizans, that hourly were increasing; the
obstinacy
of the country, the steady manner with which

the Mayor of Albany, refused his offers of alliance,
and the encouragement and protection he granted to
the fugitives and bitter enemies of his name, Van
Kortlandt
,
Bayard, and Graham; the coolness which subsisted
between the people of the country and his son-in-law
Milborne
,
who, on entering Albany, had rashly and arbitrarily
confiscated the property of many of the principal
inhabitants
,
who had absconded at his approach; all these
pressed
like a weight of lead upon his heart, and he unfortunately
possessed too little of the self-confidence and command of
visage necessary for a statesman to conceal his anxiety.
He was a stout, brawny, square shaped man, having a
stolid and unmeaning set of features; thick eyebrows
shaded his dull and inexpressive blue eyes, and his hair
was of a dark brown hue, cut close to his forehead; he
had short mustachios on his upper lip, and a strait peaked
beard grew unshorn from his chin; he was arrayed in the
solemn and dignified habit of a substantial burgher, with
dark grey stockings rolled over his knees, and immense
buckles and buttons, the last neither inconsiderable in
number
or size, a profusion also of the same ornaments graced,
in triple rows, a vest of scarlet velvet, the flaps of which
came to his knee buckles; to complete this dress, a stout
degen, of the true Williamstadt manufacture, with a great
ivory hilt, was girded to his side, while ready for use, at
the wall near at hand, hung a huge three cornered beaver,
and a tortoise shell cane, with a china head and silken
tassels.
On the day, the evening of which is now referred to,
the city had been much disturbed with riot and turmoil
that seemed nearly to threaten an open insurrection:
some of the citizens, who had heretofore expressed a
quiet submission to the authority of Leisler, had suddenly
been stirred up, and apparently without cause, had
demanded
a change of the council, while on the other hand,
the steady adherents of the government had strenuously
opposed the measurethe business had been carried to
such high excitement, that large bodies of men had
assembled together, often armed with clubs and
offensive
weapons, and every public place was swarmed
with persons who were violently canvassing the merits of
the disputation, inflaming with seditious words their own
anger and that of their hearers; together with this,
reports
were currently circulated that a new governor,
unfavourable
to the Leisler faction, had been appointed, and
might be momently expected to arrive, and it was even
said that Bayard and Nichols, the latter as bitter a foe as
the former to the present power, had been seen among
the people urging them against their opponents and
irritating
the passions of the multitude; and although
Milborne
had gone forth and declaimed loudly at every point
which appeared to be disturbed, yet much of his words
were lost on his listeners, who had often received them
in a manner that at once bespoke impatience and
dissatisfaction
;
however, as it grew later in the day, the
exertions
of Leisler's friends were apparently more
successful
,
and the feelings of the burghers allayed, so that things
had again resumed their former aspect of security, and
the repose becoming an honest Dutch city, once more
reigned in the narrow streets, which was more palpably
evinced by the afternoon's audience; whereat, (and
the fashion of holding a levee had been usual with the
other rulers of the province, once every half year,
a custom which Leisler had thought proper to follow,
as by giving a public reception to the principal
citizens
,
he might probably inspirit or increase his party,)
there were congregated a great number of the
inhabitants
,
some induced to attend the audience by their
political sentiments, but by far the greater herd, as is often
equally remarkable in our own times, by no care for the
cause or the giver of the feast, but merely for their own
sakesfor what they could get; indeed, the very pride
of the Dutch youth and beauty of New Yorke were
present
in that audience chamber, and it was with no mean
display of gallantry that many a doughty Mynheer, with his
hands in his breeches pockets, strutted beside his
favourite
damsel, who, clad in all her beauty, her red calico short
gown, her yellow ear drops, and her necklace of beads of
bright amber as large as marbles, her scarlet kirtle, hood
and wimple, a neat, buxom, bouncing deity, fit for a
Hollander's
admiration, simpered and blushed as she was
gallanted
through the muddy paths of Petticoat Lane, down
the long hill of der Warmoes-straet,
[9]
[9]
Now called Garden-street,
to the heeren gracht
up the hill to the Governor's; where, entering at the
kitchen door, for the great hall entrance was never known
to be unclosed, except upon a marriage or burial, as hath
ever been an invariable Dutch custom, and which was
brought over by the groodt Francois Rombout from
Brock, they strided lovingly into the grand chamber of
reception, which has been described; where, leaving the
object of his attention in the crowd of her own sex there
convened, who were industriously engaged in knitting and
talking scandal, Mynheer sought his own male
acquaintances
,
with whom he lighted his pipe, drank raspberry wine
and eat cookies, trolled a low Dutch love song, or talked
with the schepin, the knostabel, or the hoofdt schout, on
the affairs of the day, until the hour of departure, which
was duly and seasonably announced by the city bell, which
rang loudly from the steeple of the Gereformeerde Kerck,
(a spire, which, by the way, was believed to be superior to
the handsome one on the cathedral of Utrecht and whose
bell always tolled the hour except when the ringer
over-slept
himself in an afternoon's siesto, which he was
accustomed
to indulge in after drinking a plentiful draught of
genever;) a half an hour before the tat-too beat at the fort,
when the city gates were closed, and every honest burgher
put on his night cap and crept between his warm striped
woollen blankets, making himself as comfortable as
possible
,
and consigned himself at once to sleep and dreams
of Butter-vlict cheese, and all the luxuries of his
Vaderlandt
.
The hour for returning had come, and each stately
Mynheer sought from the assemblage his own charge, and
taking ya vrouw by the arm, and enfolding himself up
from the clear frosty night, he hastened his way
homeward
,
leaving the dogter under the care of her liefhebber
to follow his footsteps, which, though not long, far, as it
may be supposed, outstripped those of the jongvrouw
and her chosen, who both, perhaps, unconsciously enwrapt
by sweet discourses of Low Dutch, musical and
mellifluous
,
of mingled vows and tales of eternal constancy, had
wandered away in the loveliness of the night, to enjoy the
lonely solitudes of Vlatten Barrack, and the Green lane,
e'er the city gates were shut and the guard set; making,
in the old saying, the longest way round the shortest
home. Party after party slowly prepared to separate
from the gay group they had heretofore commingled
with; every body was on the move, and the crowd
momently
lessened, leaving only those behind at last, who
love to be the longest, or who lingered round the comfort
of a foreign hearth, from an experience of the
uncomfortableness
of that at home. Here might be seen a
careful
dame, tucking up her fardingales, or wrapping
beneath
her cloak sundry cribbed cookies destined for the
children, who, as she remarked, poor things, were at
home, no doubt, looking for Sante-claus, and they ought
not to be neglected; there was her helpmate, buttoning
his jerkin close under his chin and tying his handkerchief
round his ears, waiting ya vrouw's leisure, who had a
thousand remembrances to whisper her acquaintances,
and was an hour at least in taking leave of the
entertainers
,
while her impatient lord stood fidgetting, fuming, and
worrying himself sick at her delay, but which seemed to
move her not one jot; and while his visage grew as sour
as a cucumber, she wisely gave his humour full time to
change, and whatever heat, that might have invaded the
equanimity of a usual placable temper, in his impatience
a sufficient opportunity to cool, a thing not likely in a
phlegmatic Nieuw Nederlander to happen in a moment,
except when brought to such utter extremity by kicking
his heels unattended to, and waiting for a spouse who
spurned his honest control in an exposed and wind swept
hall on a winter's evening.
SECTION I.Concluded.
This let me hope, that when in public view
I bring my pictures, men may feel them true;
`This is a likeness,' may they all declare,
`And I have seen him, but I know not where;'

If as
the
likeness all should fix on

Though now the apartment had become thinned of its
guests, and in proportion to the former number who had
througed it, deserted, yet there still lingered about the
tables, which now were only defaced with the scattered
remnants of their late luxurious loads, emptied jars that
had foamed with rich beer from Wappinger's Creek,
flasks half drained smoked out pipes, with the ashes in
heaps at their sides, and seas of liquor that had been
spilled
by the revellers; a few persons, some of whom
actively
engaged in wrangling on some disputed topic, while
others dozing on their seats from want of better
employment
,
or sleeping o'er the dull prosing of some endless,
long-winded, talking Hollander, who had taken under his
especial care the safety of the whole universe, and who
decided on the propriety of every political movement
of moment that had been lately made in Europe as well
as the Nieuw Nederlandts, were heedless of the
weariness
of their hosts, and appeared to make no preparation
for quitting their seats, although every body around them
was on the move for speedy departure. Characters of
this description are to be found in every situation of
society
;
men, forgetful of the cheer extended them, who
bear down, and fairly wear out hospitality, imposing on
decency and good manners, and who may be fairly classed
under that denomination of personages whom the
house-wives
describe as wearing at a visit their `sitting breeches.
The very type of this long anchored species, were two
individuals, who had taken their places, probably for the
sake of observing those who withdrew from the room,
on a long settle that stood a few paces from the door:
the one of these was a man of such towering stature, that
when he stood, even with an inclination of the head, the
crown of his beaver came unsociably in contact with the
low and smoky ceiling of the apartment; while the other
was a clear reverse of figure to his companion, being one
of those short-necked, pudding-headed, double-bodied
fellows, who have not an inch of limb to spare, and whose
flesh is comfortably rolled round them like the warm
fleece round the unshorn sheep; the taller was a broad,
leathern faced looking character, with a swearing stare,
and a nose that predominated over the rest of his
features
in the shape of a punch ladle, and bearing at the
extremity a deep copper tinge; his hair was of an iron
grey colour, and his appearance bespoke him a man of
some consequence, and indeed he was no less a
personage
than schepin Jacobus Kip, Roymeester, and candidate
for the place of der heer officier, while the little man, who
sat beside him, an almost silent listener, was a Dutch
apothecary and doctor of medicine, bred at the schools
of Hoorn, where he became, as his comfortable person
bespoke, a proficient in the delicious study of fat beef,
good butter, and `groene kaas;' he was called Hans
Kierstede, and truly he was a most appropriate
companion
for schepin Kip; for he had on that evening, as was
his custom at all good opportunities, given his
predominant
propensity of eating its full range and sway, and he was
at its close situated somewhat as the monstrous
constrictor
of the East, who after his bloody banquet, stretches
himself out in the shade, listless and incapable of action;
and much so it fared with honest Hans, who being what
is commonly termed brimful of the feast, and stuffed like
a tick with good fare, was in an excellent mood of patient
hearing, while his associate, who was one who had from
his station, a fair opportunity of an extensive
acquaintance
,
both among the groodt und klien Burgerrecht von
Nieuw Yorck, and was withal greatly given to the
uncharitable
Vol. II. 4
propensity of reflecting on the characters and
actions of his neighbours with ungodly virulence when
once set out, between the arduous discussion of a half
emptied pipe, took the whole conversation to himself,
uninterrupted by his half dozing hearer, except when,
after some long and minute scrutiny of all about him, in
an interval of wakefulness, occasioned by the violent
gestures
and utterance of Mienheer Kip, there was enforced
on his sight the rapid demolition of the viands that had
been prepared for the company, and the scraps that now
remained in their places; then, as roused by such
destruction
,
the doughty Kierstede edged in some proper
culinary
stricture, and forgetful of his own avidity at their
consumption, he deprecated the fashion of the cookery
that had been used, and sometimes where he praised, (for
some few of the dishes he admitted were commendable,
though not more than to pass,) he added a lugubrious
lamentation
,
that from want of appetite and weakness of
digestion, he had not been enabled to do justice to that
which had been set before him. From where these
worthies
sat, all who departed from the room were
conspicuous
to their observation, and it will not be wondered at,
that the remarks of schepin Kip on his fellow burghers
partook largely of his spleenful and cynical disposition.
Mien goodt mans, Hans Kierstede, quoth the
schepin
,
familiarly clapping his hand on his neighbour's thigh,
and puffing his pipe through one corner of his mouth,
while he directed the apothecary's attention to a little
man with a bald head and a hitch in his gait, who was
bowing and scraping, and wriggling and smiling, and
holding
,
with all the apparent warmth of friendship and of an
attached heart, the hand of the Lieutenant Governor, as
he paid him his obeisance at departure, while Leisler
seemed to reciprocate his kindness, as conscious of his
worth and faithfulnessMien goodt man, Hans
Kierstede
,
said Jacobus Kip in low Dutch, to the doctor of
medicine, (though his words are here translated for the
benefit of the reader;) I tell you this, my friend, and I
promise you the truth when you listen to what I tell you:
you see that man with his bow and his smile, his ready
hand and bending head, like a Chinese mandarin; you
know him as you would know a bad stuyver, my friend
Hans; then I tell you this, he is as big a rogue as you will
see with your eyes between Nieuw Amsterdam and Dort,
from which my grandfather came I tell you this, he will
cut his own mother's throat for a bad dotkinwhat do
you say to that, my man, Hans Kierstede?
Dat vas a vat kapoen, a ver vine pird, muttered
the auditor, who with thoughts intent on a more
generous
subject, had heard but little of the invective of his
querulous companion; tish drue, said Hans, dat
pird wash tesberate pad tressed; dey do dings betters at
Hoorns.
My mans, Hans Kierstede, continued schepin Kip,
unconscious in his warmth, to the lack of the apothecary's
attention to his discourse, I tell you this, Dirk Von
Rikketie is a great knave; he that trusts to him may
venture
on the ice in the Overslaugh in spring weather;
see how he bows and grins, as if his back was as crooked
as the Y; you think from his looks he is the friend of
Leisler; for all that, you see, I tell you this, Hans
Kierstede
,
he is no more the friend of Leisler than he is that
of Claus Bayard; he is his own friend aloneone man is
up on the ladder, the other is at the foot; Dirk contrives
to keep place with allthis morning he followed Orloffe
and Claus; the evening comes, he is with Leisler, and
to-morrow if Bayard stands where Leisler now stands, I
tell you this, Dirk bows and grins to Claus, as at all times
he had been his stoutest followersee there, he limps
away with himself, pursued Mienheer Kip, as the
person
whose merits he had descanted on disappeared from
the apartment, so the devil limps. I wonder whether
with all his bad deeds, his sycophancy and hypocrisy, if
Dirk sleeps like an honest manhis head is bald and
venerable
;
but what think you of his heart, Hans
Kierstede
?
Dat gansmien zeil! Burgomaster Brezier eat dat
gans, Ik had nien a morzhel do but mit mien deeth,
responded
Kierstede, but twash padly kooked doo;
Mienheer
Kip, I vill deach you der ding, you kan dell beople's
py de way dey tress der gans, niet te nien, der gans if
stewed closh mit zourgrout, would nien pe zo pad zdill;
dey kooks gans at Hoorn in dat vashion, Mienheer
Kips.
Mienheer Jacobus impatiently shrugged up his
shoulder
at the abrupt and untimely remarks of the little
doctor
of medicine, and he drew a long whiff from his pipe
at the unrelenting stupidity of his companion, and for the
moment determined to waste on his dull ear no farther
words; but he was not able to hold good his resolution,
as there sailed past him to the door, in all the pomp of
importance, a huge, lusty, black-browed man, upon whose
arm hung, in amorous fondness, a plain little Dutch
woman
,
her small grey eyes simpering from under her
crimped
Flemish cap upon her massy protector.
Mien man, Hans Kierstede, broke forth the
schepin
,
as he beheld the fond couple move by him, you
see that man with his wife, who is just gone through the
door;'tis Doctor Kindermeester, that has married the
rich widow of our old burgherwhat a strut and splutter
he makes! but he is all strut and splutter, puff and blaze,
while his great carcass and brains are hollow and empty
plenty of room in his skull for the wind he sends forth
I tell you my friend, he looks like an ox, and his brains
are like an ox's brains. By my trow, heavy and dull
enough; though, Hans Kierstede, he deserves credit for
his ingenuity, when he imposed on the Burgomasters at
Leyden, and sold them for a vast quantity of guilders, a
stinking cabbage patch, advising the besotted purchasers
to make it a public physic garden, like the Felix Meretis.
Ho! ha! and the schepin chuckled as he spoke, what
think you, Hans Kierstede? he purposed to read lectures!
well, I'll tell you then, he pockets the pay and the lectures
remain in the books from whence he steals all his
lectures
;
for, Hans, it is convenient for such men who want
minds to steal it from the works of others; and while he
dissipated a fortune got by such fraud, the stink weed
and the pudding stone are the most flourishing plants that
adorn his famous physic garden; and that is not all let me
tell you, my man, Hans Kierstede, this great bladder of
a fellow, would have had the burgomasters believe him a
very Boerhaave; but let me tell you the truth, my friends
den Hogen Mogenheid of Vaderlandt, are not such fools;
and when they doubted doctor Kindermeester's
pretensions
,
he kicked and huffed in a great dudgeon; and now
out of pure spite, and mortification, he hath come to the
Nieuw Nederlandts to set up a school of medicine that
will make the professors in the low countries die with
envy and spleen, and this, my man Hans, he promises to
do without a guilder from the stadt. Let me tell you my
friend, it is very well for men when they have no credit
with their high mightinesses, having once imposed on
them like this doctor Kindermeester, to say they do not
want a guilder to assist their vain projects from the
public
pocketthe truth is, let the offer be made, or let there
be a chance of getting something from the stadt, and then
see whether these boasters would not snap at it as
greedily
as a hungry cur would at a kitchen boneI tell you
the truth, Hans Kierstede, this fat doctor of medicine is
all vapour and conceit: he pokes his nose in the first
places to make the credulous burghers believe him a
great man; but I tell you my man Hans, it can do an ass
no good to pass for a lion, for the more he moves the
more you see his tail; and the truth is as to Doctor
Kindermeester
,
that of one half he meddles in he knows as
little as the salmon fish that bounces in the Maes
Zalmon, schepin Kip? mien hertz! said doctor Hans
Kierstede, rubbing his eyes as if just awakened, and
having
only heard the last words addressed to him:
Zalmon
!
dish ish as vone vine vish ven dey kooks him as
you sall zee zerved on a burgomaster's tinner dable
mien hertz, how dey kooks him mit budder and kreens at
HoornGot! mien moud vaders at der dought op him
tressed mit Zaucemien zeil, dat Hoorns de blace mit
der kokwinkels, Mienheer Kip.
Mienheer Kip turned in evident vexation from his
companion
,
and petulantly for a while employed himself in
silence to the finishing of his pipe, as he could not but
perceive from the little apothecary's manner, that he had
scarcely understood a word with which he had honoured
4*
him, and until startled by the mention of an eatable, had
fairly been nodding in a short dose; but however offended
he was for the moment with his chuckle-pated listener,
such temptation to invade the reluctant taciturnity of the
schepin was not to be withstood, as presented itself in the
dress, assumed airs of importance, and well known
characters
of the guests who passed him, as they flitted from
the apartment like shadows by a glass, which reflected
their form and shape, nor concealed a deformity; but in
truth it is but justice to the memory of the schepin (who,
by the by, lies buried in the churchyard of
Garden-street
Church, not far from burgomaster Peachy Prauw
Van Zandt,) to state that with a small allowance to his
splenetic temper, which in later years had been increased
by the Vroedschap's rejecting all his plans for public
improvement
,
as they were so disinterested and economical
that they would not, if put in operation, have yielded a
farthing by way of speculation or contract to any
dignified
burgomasters, whether he was a tailor or a dirt
contractor, that in his description of such as fell under
his perview, he did not greatly exaggerate the fact; and
therefore it can be judged from those attributed by
schepin Jacobus Kip to their forbears, what virtues the
descendants of the honest, staunch, and thrifty burghers
of Nieuw Amsterdam in der Nieuw Nederlandts, have
inherited and improved on; and although mankind, it may
be asserted, progresses slowly in most matters of
civilization
in many parts of this habitable world, the province of
New-York is certainly not one of them; for the quick
intellect
of the Yankee, and the steady bottom of the
Dutchman
,
being well grafted together, have produced a stock
whose fruitfulness in all arts, (
fas et nefas
,) may bid
defiance
for comparison to the whole globe. Vain were it
to give an accurate outline of the multifarious remarks on
the many rich subjects of sarcasm that flowed from the
lips of the worthy schepin, and were unheard by the dull
hearing (or rather when he was listening and awake,
passed
in one ear and went out of the other) of the excellent
doctor of medicine, his companion, by whose evidence the
assailed never could have convicted Mienheer Kip of
slander
;
(for truth in slander and libel, by some learned
civilians
,
and most particularly Dirk Von Rikketie, when it
affected men in power, and of course his friends, was
reckoned inadmissable and very criminal, and always
received
from his immaculate judgment, severe
animadversion
,
and a committal to the Rasphuis;) for doctor Hans
Kierstede was a veritable and patient being, who never
in his whole life contrived to remember a word of the
shortest story he ever heard, and his memory was never
burthened beyond a recipe for cookery of some kind or the
other, and that he conned for weeks, as a student doth his
exercise; he was indeed a creature that took the world
easy, and lived for nothing but eating Group after
group moved on in their departure, and but few
slipped
away unobserved by the keen eye and sharp tongue
of the honest Mienheer, who was seldom in his
strictures
known to be more lenient to an ass though
covered
with gold, than had he but worn a shabby
packsaddle
;
for he was a sad enemy of those who, swollen with
new gotten wealth, assume airs of grandeur and
consequence
,
and forgetful of their own origin, would be
thought of a race superior to their fellow burghers, the
very matter of their pride showing their ignorance,
because
,
who that boasted sense, would suppose that either
high living, drinking, or dressing; can elevate one piece
of worthless clay beyond another, or make the blood and
body of the grandson of a footman and washerwoman
better
than his ancestors.No; there is much in the Italian
proverb when applied to the fair and gorgeous garments,
and the boasted family of so vain a coxcomb: that a
white glove often covers a dirty hand; certainly it ought
to be apparent to such pieces of pampered insignificance,
that Providence, when it modelled the form of the veriest
vagrant that begs along the public streets, took as much
pride and care as in the making of a prince. Mienheer
Kip, in his survey, did by no means spare this sort of
gentry; for their conceit and impudence was a thing of
singular mirth to himand he chuckled heartily at his
own conception as a young burgher and his new
married
bride sallied past him, with an excess of airs and
affectation; scarce deigning in their haughtiness of
pride to recognise, even by a nod, the honest schepin,
who had smoked many a pipe and drank many a pot of
beer with their father, who had been an honest Dutch
cooper, and got himself a comfortable fortune, which
was all his children seemed to have inherited from him;
for no sooner did they possess his money than they
endeavoured to shut from remembrance the means
whereby he acquired it, and could not bear the sight of a
hoop or a stave; while, to impose on others and make it
believed their descent was beyond reality, having heard
such were the fashions in the old countries they got an
ingenious painter to compose a coat of arms, but such a
one it was as would have puzzled a herald to have read:
it was surmounted by a cap, purporting to be a ducal
coronet
,
and many other rare and magnificent devices, of
which the bearers were extremely proud, and which, when
recognised by schepin Kip on sundry corners of their
apparel
,
he marvelled first greatly thereat; for the painter,
being a native born Nieuw Nederlander, and having never
seen the coronet of a duke, had thereon exercised his
fancy
and shaped it rather clumsily, so that the ready eye of
Mienheer Kip at first took it to be no other than the
representation
of half a butter firkin (such as the honest cooper
used to fashion for the goed vrouws of Goshen) after it had
been sawed in twain, as was often the custom of the saving
citizens of Nieuw Amsterdam, and which hath been even
handed down to these days, the separate halves making
two excellent tubs; but on the schepin's taking a more
certain
sight, (and he laughed hugely at the idea) he in his
own mind determined the coronet was no other than a
representation of old Schermerhorne's of Schenectadie,
(with whom the cooper's family had become related by
intermarriage,) red worsted nightcap, which the
Dutchman
(for he was dogwhipper, as is related somewhere
before
in this veritable historie, to his native town,) used to
clap on his head when his beaver was mislaid, when he
rushed out of his homestead in pursuit of some noisy cur,
the terror of boys and dogs. At the same time there
occurred
from the incident to the memory of schepin Kip,
his having been terrible put out to understand the
meaning
of a shield with a bar or cheveron, that Mienheer
Walton, the rich barber, had placed over his street door in
the large new house he had just erected; and the thought
struck the schepin forcibly, that it was an act of great
humility in the barber, who, although he had become an
immense rich man, would not forget his original mean
occupation, but wished to remind the world of what he
had been and how he had made his money; for the
ingenious
Kip construed the shield into a representation of a
barber's basin, flattened by the unskilfulness of the
carver, and the cheveron into an open razor. And indeed
the schepin was an admirer of humility in all persons, and
it is not suprising that his very bowels rose within him in
bitterness at the many airs of mock greatness that passed
under his observation; but he was most particularly
angered
,
and that almost beyond control, when he was rather
rudely and bearishly rubbed against, (as if he had been a
nobody,) and his pipe nearly knocked from him in passing,
by a little, stout, squab built personage, so vastly distended
with his own magnitude as scarce to be able to see any
one except his own all-important figure, and at the same
time taking room to make a most significant
gesticulation
and shrug, as he closed one eye and with a manner
the most portentous, ejaculated to a lean, trembling
looking man at his elbow, the words `you know,' which
seemed to make the poor fellow shrink into himself with
terror; without ceremony, as if it had not been in the
way, this worthy trod on the foot of schepin Kip, till it
made him wince again with the weight, and then moved
out of the room without apologizing by a word to the
poor burgher, who could not speak for the pain inflicted
so ruthlessly on him, but kept shaking up and down the
aching limb, now putting it on the floor, then raising it up,
all the while groaning, and moaning, and twisting, and
drawing up with many ludicrous and lugubrious contortions
his long features, while tears of agony rolled down his
stout visage.

dough dey are goot poiled mit vleesh; quoth Hans
Kierstede
,
wakening from a long nap in surprise, and not at first
perceiving the wry faces of schepin Kip, which,
however
,
when he beheld, he added in a tone of pity and
condolence
:
Mienheer Kip, mien hertz! vats de madders
mit u?
It may well be supposed when the schepin had, by long
and tender assiduities, somewhat lulled the biting
sharpness
of his pain, that he launched out rather virulently
against the cause of his anguish, and ran the burgher
most violently down behind his back, and called him by
many hard names, and related at every twinge of his toe,
some tough story concerning the way he had attained
great wealth, from being at first an ostler in the stables of a
burgher of Ostend; and how, even out of the sweepings of
his master's stables, he had made money; and that from
only looking at the back of the Dutch bible instead of the
inside
,
when he said his prayers, he had now the assurance
to assert it was no harm to take as many per cent for
loans that he had made, under good security, to the
necessitous
as he pleased, and therefore the dominie was
never able to persuade him to obey the law of Holland as
to interest, because he did not think it allowed sufficient
profit; so that his interest very soon, in most cases, was as
great as the principal he first advanced. But in the midst
of his invectives against this cause of his torture, the
worthy
schepin could not but laugh to himself, as nearly
to forget his hurt, at the recollection of the burgher's
being once finely tricked in his own way, by a sharp
witted Yankee, who sold him a horse; and the schepin
considered it a prime, first rate, capital joke, that he who
had skinned so many in his time, should have been at
last caught by the false skin of an animal he was bred up
with. His hand, said Mienheer Kip, must certainly
have been out with the curry-comb, or it could not have
been possible, my mans, Hans Kierstede, to have so
nicely shut his eyes with the blinds.
Mienheer Kip continued his censures on others of the
guests at great length, after the pain of his toe had fairly
departed, and he considered himself so fully revenged on
the uncivil inflictor of the injury, as to turn his attention
to those who followed him from the apartment on their
way homewards.
My mans, Hans Kierstede, said Mienheer, and his
very words are used, there not being the same necessity
to make them good English as induced me before to
render
them as far as ability allowed, for the edification of
the reader; my mans, Hans Kierstede, quoth he, in a
broken Low Dutch, half English and half Hollandt, and

And as he spoke, having knocked the ashes from his
pipe, followed by his associate, he hastened with mighty
strides towards the door, which they had scarcely attained
ere their further progress was arrested by a crowd of
persons whose entrance in the apartment by the outlet
which they were seeking, opposed and prevented their
leaving it. The drum, whose sound had invaded the
quiet flowings of Mienheer Kip's remarks, and which he
had supposed was the usual warning for retirement to all
honest and peaceable citizens, had, however, on this
evening been beaten for entirely another purposeit was
an alarm, and in a few minutes was followed by the hoarse
and heavy clangor of the city bells, whose doleful tongues
pealed forth in notes of terror to the awakened and
startled
burghers of Nieuw Amsterdamwho in the memory of
man had heard the like but twice before, once while stout
old Stuyvesant prepared for the approach of his conqueror,
Colonel Nichols, and lastly when the news came that the
dastard Manning had surrendered to Evertse and Benkes,
and that their fleet was coming down the Narrows with
all sail set for the city of the Manahadoes. As the sound
continued, its dread voice swept over the deep and massy
heap of crowded buildings, and invading the close and
heavy defiles that composed the darksome streets, burst
on the ear of the slumbering inhabitants. The tardy
Nederlander
turned on his couch, and shook his wearied
limbs, and rubbed his eyes, and stared about him
astonished
as the noise struck his ear; the wary trafficker,
whose storehouses were filled with merchandise, leaped
from his couch in a momentand the light rest of the
lover was driven from eyes where it scarce had lingered.
An instant past the city had appeared like some serpent
coiled harmless in his dusky ring, stirless as though his
fangs were palsied in death,the brief space of time is
fled, his repose hath been disturbed, his barbed tongue
darts fire, and his very skin glitters in his anger,so,
through every corner of the late midnight which had
slept upon the city, lights break and flash vividly, as stars
shooting in the firmament, from casement to casement
they flare; and heads yet in their nightgear were thrust
from the half opened door and unclosed window forth
into the streets, and voice after voice hailed those who
came within reach of the cry, but who, scarce attending
to the call, passed onwardseager yet fearful to inquire
the rise of the disturbance.
Soon all were in motion; those who had been hurrying
home belated, joined the throng, and those who had but
so lately quitted the scene of revelry at the fort, and who
were wandering off on their separate ways, turned back
their steps, seeking as they went, at their neighbours and
those whom they met, the sudden cause which all alike
were hastening to learn: and, although the truth was to
them unknown, there were not wanting veracious
wiseacres
,
as is usual at such times, who started a hundred wild
and groundless suggestions, which, however palpably
preposterous
and remote from the slightest foundation, were
satisfactorily sworn to by their authors, and lacked no
small number of believers. Some cried that the Indians,
having fired Beverwyck and Schenectady, had come down
the river, massacreing, burning, and scalping men, women,
and children; sparing neither the head of the aged, nor
the feeble bodies of the helpless infant and its tender
motherthat they had landed at Vredendaal, and were
now at Golden Hill, ready to rush upon the strengthless
palisades of the city. Some had seen them frightfully
painted and armedothers had been deafened with their
savage war whoops. Some had another tale of terror,
which they anxiously sought to force on the credence of
their ready hearers: that the ancient foemen, the French,
had a fleet riding at Naijarlij; that Nottens island was in
their possession; that they had erected batteries, which
were ready at a word to sweep the whole town to ashes;
that unless the council, which was understood to be
convened
for the purpose, instantly surrendered, that the
flames of their dwellings would light the march of the
unrelenting
and ruthless enemy, and that all would
indiscriminately
Vol. II. 5
be given to the slaughtering knifewhile
others yet more timid, trembled at the monster they
themselves
conjured, reported that the danger that threatened
was even nearer at handit was within their own homes
there was, they told an insurrection among the negroes,
who had set the city on fire at several different quarters,
and were running about like devils, cutting the throats of
all they found; and that although the flames spread
terrifically
that on account of the vast quantities of smoke,
the light of the ascending blaze was obscured from the
eyes of those who looked in the directions pointed out as
the places where the destructive element was ragingand
lastly, there were not a few who whispered about,
serious
in tone and visage, that the time was arrived foretold
by the ill-treated Yokup Van Veltzlear, who had a few
years previous, pretending to be divinely inspired, made a
terrible hue and cry in the streets, crying on the bridge
and before the houses of the Hon. Stenwyck and John
Lawrence, wo, wo to the crowne of pride and the
drunkearts
of Ephreim! Two woes past and the third coming,
except you repent, repentrepent, as the kingdome of
God is at hand; and for which solemn prophecy, he
had been most unceremoniously and soundly flogged by
the common hangman, Anthonie De, who being a proper
long-limbed, close-fisted, New-England man, always took
good care to let every body who came under his thumb
by means of the law, know him so well as to steer clear
of his fingers thereafter; and after said flagellation,
Yokup was kicked out of the colony by order of the
reprobate
Dutch Governor who then reigned, and who, it
was said, never repented, except over a brandy bottle
when it was emptied of its contentsall this persecution
it was now remembered that Yokup had endured patiently
and meekly; proving perfectly the old saw, that a
prophet
is never respected in his own country. Stirred by
these several rumours, the free-hearted patriot, who
had heretofore, at every public opportunity, offered his
fortune and his life to the service and protection of his
native land, began to wish in spite of himself, that his
property was in a safe place, and took more than one
serious
thought of how in the confusion he might convey
away his person unharmed. The gallant leader of the
enrolled citizens, who the day before had manfully
swaggered
and strutted at the head of his followers, and
courageously
flourished his thirsty steel, anxious for its trial
on the carcasses of any who dared front him, now was
seized, most unfortunately for the display of his valor, by
an unaccountable weakness in the knees and eyesight;
the latter being brought to so poor a state that he was
unable to find the deadly weapons of his defence
so, feeling unfit for duty, yet troubled for the
welfare
of the city, while departing therefrom for the
benefit
of country air, he sent word to the next in
command
,
who, however, (for one misfortune never comes
alone) was not to be heard of, for being a tailor, (it is the
fashion for tailors to be great military characters) he had,
in the phrase of his trade, taken with his goose and
thimble
long stiches, and was snugly buttoned in his cellar pantry
while the pompous Burgomaster on the other hand, was
started to such activity, that he actually ran to the Council
Chamber, determined that no time should be lost ere he
gave his vote that the commander of the foe (if such was
arrived) should be received with all due honours;
that a Committee should be deputed to wait on him with
a congratulatory address, and escort him to a public
dinner
,
to which, nevertheless, orders were specially to be
given that none but the private friends of the members
of the corporation should be inviteda maxim since
come to universal adoption, the public being taxed and
their name used to fatten a whole herd of aldermen and
their families, while they themselves, the public, who
pay for these feasts, have not the eating of a mouthful,
being literally situated like a man who gives a splendid
dinner or merry making in his own house, yet is obliged
by his guests to remain without doors during the
entertainment
;
or if, as it had been otherwise stated by the
rumour, that the town was already on fire, the
burgomaster
resolved, that efficient measures should be
taken to turn the tide of the flame, if it chanced to come
in the direction of his property, to that of certain
neighhours
who resided in an adjoining street, for although
these persons were respectable and industrious enough,
yet they were too peaceable in public matters to be good
citizens, scarcely having been known to give their
suffrage
at an election for members of the Council, or if they
had, the votes had been against the burgomaster in question,
therefore, they were assuredly dangerous to society, and
the sooner they were denounced and got rid of the
better
and
then withal, the boastful recreant, who hourly
had jeered virtue among his abandoned fellows, and had
cried out that he recked not, cared not for the amends
an ill spent life demanded, who reviled God and man in
his boldness, whose thoughts of after life were drowned
in the enjoyment of the present, who mocked at honesty
and despised innocence, with whom religion had been a
jest and honour a blasphemy to pleasure, who founded his
tenets on the saying of the King of Israel, as the tree
falleth, so it liethwho knoweth the soul of the man
goeth upwards, or the soul of the beast that goeth
downwards
?
he too began to feel an irksome load within his
breast; his philosophy was weakened, and in vain he
strived to rally it to his aid; he would have hid, but he
knew not where. However, when these inquirers
commingled
with those who had thronged before them at the
moat that encircled the fort, they found the gates closed,
the drawbridge raised, the sarazine dropped, and
sentinels
posted on the walls, who most uncourteously seemed
to deny both ingress and egress, and to the anxious
seeking
of the numerous questioners, were unwilling, or what
appeared equally probable, were unable to return any
satisfactory
answers. The noise still continued: the
hollow
beat of the alarm drum at intervals, and the increased
and unceasing tollings of the bell, sent their deep and
mournful notes in the night air, that had before wafted its
currents as peaceful as an infant slumbering on the bosom
of its careful and tender nurse; the sounds rolled along
the mountainous and rocky banks of the sterile shores of
Weehawken, which trembled with the echo; the forest
animal, who slept in the mazes of the woods that lined
the declivities of Hobouk, leapt from his lair, awakened
as by the startling shout of the pursuing huntsman, and as
the long reverberations floated to the heights of
Breukelin
,
those who dwelt in its sound looked abroad, and while
the moonlight, with its fickle beam gleamed for an instant
and broke through the cold clouds and fell on the bleak
earth beneath, like the changeful smile of beauty, that
seeks a face it loves, yet doubts to gaze upon, and
rendered
visible the black shadow of the stirring and distant city
as they cast their eyes in wonderment towards it and
hearkened to the echoes which seemed like the roaring
of afar off thunder.
And now the reader, if he has any curiosity thereto,
arising from the effect which has been here described,
or otherwise, on examining the section which immediately
adjoins this, which is now fast concluding, will not remain
long in doubt concerning the cause of all this dire distress,
and in much less period of time than the crowd who had
collected therefor received the same information.

SECTION II.
Whatt though these chaynes, these slavyshe manacles,
Doe bynde my lymbes wytthyn theyre yrone foldes;
Whatt, though I stande here a lyvynge mockerie
Of thy tryumphe, dothe yt make thee my equale?

I were not then, though ttendede yn my pryde,
More above thee yn soule, base hynde, than now.
The Ancyent Chronycle of the Proude Captyve
.
THE PRISONERS AND THE COUNCIL.
See that strict guard be had with the prisoners, said
a voice sternly at the entrance of the audience chamber,
whose natural tone was elevated in command, if not
swelled
beyond its accustomed height by conscious authority;
and beware lest their bonds slip the tythe of an inch; an
they stir or raise hand for flight, be ye not back with
your steel or shot, nor fail to discharge your pieces home,
so that their deadly contents seat in their vile hearts.
Look to your charge I say, an ye love the house of
Jacob
Leisler, ye will not care to hew in atoms a dog of the
name of Bayard.
As the person who spoke these words uttered them,
he crossed the threshold and strode into the apartment.
He was a man of slender and effeminate appearance,
arrived
at that middle era of human existence when the
character becomes settled, the mind hath its full vigor,
and the passions, whose violence deform, ambition and
revenge, are lasting, quick, and pursuing, and do even
engross the soul, a business of life more than at any other
period. Youth starts like the wild horse; but having
flashed forth its fiery qualities, grows calm; age runs
cold; but it is manhood, when every resolution is long,
during, and determinate. Nevertheless, from the first
glance on the visage of this person; there was not that
which gave strength of expression or would induce a belief
that it was often moved from the apparent gentleness that
always seemed to rest on it; but the first impression of the
countenance of man is often deceptive, and this was one
of those formations of congregated features that delights
the superficial observer, and passes current with the
world at large; a face, a vizard rather, enmasking
deformity
,
such as is worn by the smooth hypocrite whose
virtue
is outward show, and who, by politic public charities,
renders it hard if not impossible for him to be exposed in
his true shape, which is only shown in his seizing every
secret and private opportunity to put in force his meanness
and crime. This man's complexion was fair, with heavy
brows and knotted forehead; his hair was glossy, and at
once tastefully and accurately divided in front, so that it fell
in long thick curls to his neck; while a small line of beard,
cut with the most exquisite skill, wavering on his upper lip,
exhibited the neat trimmed mustachio, and it was in that
feature, his swelling lip, that there lurked in its changeful
curve a movement which elicited in part its owner's
character
,
boastful and overbearing haughtiness and
insolence
of demeanour; and there was an evidence in his
actions against him, for in spite of his hurried steps and
the strong excitement by which he appeared agitated,
there was an affectation of manner and a studied air with
which he carried himself, that at once bespoke his
self-opinion
and consequence; the very art with which he
threw from his shoulders his rich cloak, lined with
Venetian
velvet, and discovered a dress beneath fit for the
gayest court gallant, having silk swashes with deep gold
fringe at the end in his doublet, embroidered vest, and
silver garters edged with lace, omitting none of the
numerous
knots, ruffles, tassels, and other fripperies,
peculiar
to the then reigning fashion, had something in it that
laid bare to the observer the pride and superiority, which
over those about him, he evidently claimed. No sooner
had this personage placed his feet fairly in the room, than
he was surrounded by its occupants, who eagerly striving
by every means, to attract his attention, thrust on him
question
after question, each seeking to be heard first, and at
the same moment, by the number and rapidity of their
inquiries
,
giving him neither time or chance, if he so willed,
to answer or even hear themhowever, they might have
all been satisfied by a few words, for all tended to one
point, the cause of the hubbub without. He whom they
addressed, nevertheless, noticed not their solicitations,
but with a strong arm made way for himself through all
obstructions, until he approached Leisler near enough
to hold communication with him; and indeed the
Governor
in their alarm had met heretofore with little
ceremony
from his guests, for all respect had been forgotten
to persons, every one having acted for himself, and pushed
before his neighbour to the doorway; in their eagerness,
jostling and elbowing each other without regard to
consequence
or dignity; the eyck meester having, in the
conflict
to get forward, rubbed most unceremoniously his
lean sides against the fat ribs of the city goaler, a
character
and officer in those days as in this, of infinite
magnitude
,
having risen from the office of burgomaster, for it
was a salaried station, and such places in the city it is well
known are never given to any person who is not in some
way related, or is in propria persona a veritable member
of the Corporation; and this official dignitary, who had
together with the conducting of the whipping post, also
that of the wooden horse and the gallows, in his anxiety
had bolted on the rear of the receiver general of the
revenue
,
who with his enormous weight nearly stove in the
goodly round paunch that ornamented in advance the
presence
of a lordly and puissant echevin. In truth, all
was rushing, struggling, tugging, treading on heels,
and many sore pushings behindwards; every body being
desirous of having a foot in front of his neighbour, as
if such advantage would afford a moment's speedier
knowledge, and losing more time, nathless, in the heat and
labour of the contest than such satisfaction might have
been attained.
Father, I bear you news that will make your heart
leap like the blood in the veins of youth, said the
stranger
,
taking Leisler by the hand, for be the other when
it will, there never set sun on so prosperous an hour for
our fortunes as but now it hath done.
By myn trouwe, zon Yaakoop Milbourne? inquired
the Governor with a vacant stare; what geschreeuw is
dis, hey?
For heaven's sake what is the matter? broke out a
dozen voices at one breath, each speaker unmindful of
every thing but his own impatience.
Goot heer! sbeak, Mienheer Milbourne, ish myn huis
mit vuer? cried a rich burgher, whose soul was enwrapt
in his possessions.
Mienheer, dell me vor der heer zakes, ish mien neger
prokes on myn frauw, und der kind, ejaculated another.
Der Fransch, der Indiaan, der neger, der vuer,
burst in one broken and distracting yell from the lips of
the bystanders.
Give me your compassion, kind masters, vainly
strove Milbourne, forced to explain, I lack but time to
your biddinghear me; there is
Oprizing of dem togs, der zlaaf, interrupted one.
Der shitty, der stadt ish as vone prite vlame,
pursued
another, in a note as dismal as an owl.
Den every podies mill hab his drote kut mit his oor,
echoed a third in a transport of despair.
For your own sakes, masters, let me but have the
chance of a word, cried Milbourne entreatingly, I
assure
ye all there is nought ye should fear.
Mien goot Got! is it zo? quoth one.
Tish a wonderful ding den, cried another.
Teer, mien hertz! who'd dort now, continued a
third, raising his hands in amazement.
Yes, masters, pursued Milbourne, at length finding
an opportunity to speak uninterrupted, those doubtful
bells should change their chime from alarm to
rejoicing
,
for albeit, treason may have been busied near us
his disguise hath been torn to rags. Good father-in-law,
your honour, and perhaps life, this night hath been
preserved
a
cur hath been found creeping unnoted towards
us, whose lip was fraught with venom and with death
his taking were worth the jewels of Loretto.
Mien hernel! Ik zoud guain zyne meening weeten,
responded Leisler, with a look that bespoke how little
he comprehended the words of his son-in-law.
Merciful Jaacob! Mienheers, don't worry the poor
young man; he looks quite worn out; here interposed
dame Leisler, pushing herself towards Milbourne, and
with tender solicitude raising her smelling bottle: why
he looks fainting, poor creaturedear, after your fatigue
will you have some cowslip wine, or poppy water?
Indeed
this will
What is this alarm? tell us if you can, impolitely
interrupted those around; drowning the offers and
anxiety
of the dame in their vociferous inquiries.
I am not backwards in answering, for there is not
cause; said Milbourne, ` there are those in durance
with us, whose name, howe'er it hath been a terror, shall
be now no more than a jest; yes, the very tongue of
dissension
hath been plucked by its baleful roots. What
think ye, friends, of Jacob Leisler and of the liberating
revolution that on the British throne hath placed the
glorious
William? our bitter foes are chained captives in our
handsthe Lord hath delivered our enemies up, bound
hand and footthe traitors, Nicholas Bayard and Walter
Nichols, are both prisoners in this house.
The anouncement of an event so interesting and
important
to every inhabitant of the province, seemed to
electrify
the hearers: there were some who turned pale,
as though stricken with the breath of the deadly fiery
wind of the Scripturethe eyes of some roved around,
sparkling with delight, seeking countenances that
reflected
an index of their own, which were brightened by
gratified triumph and revengeand there were some
who incredulously shook their heads, and ventured to
whisper
doubtingly to those who were nearest, as though
scarce induced to grant faith to that which they had heard
and there were still others, whose visages darkened
and whose countenances fell like the black shade of the
cypress tree at evening over a tombindeed, in that
assemblage
,
although not many, being as heretofore shown,
thinned of its numbers, there were but few men
indifferent
,
and who were not affected by the intelligence;
nevertheless
,
most were silent, nor gave voice to their
thoughts, albeit here and there some retainer of the
government
and the Leisler family, some hired placeman,
violent partizan or pensioner, attuned his throat to
rejoicing
,
and shouted, as in duty bound joyous and lustily,
and cries rang through the wide apartment from many a
lip pliant to all occasions, and ready to bellow as loud for
the conquered, had the victory been theirs.
Ik ver blyd 'er my over; Ik heb geluck! quoth
Leisler with eager rapture `dat is, Ik is vortunute,
Hab mien gounshil been zend vor? zay, mien zon
Yaakoop
,
zay, vor Ik ver blyd 'er my over.
The officers of the Council, sir, have all been duly
summoned
,
and now await directions; therefore it is best that
the room be cleared, returned the person he addressed.
Regt! drue, das is drue, said the Governor.
It is necessary that you depart, my masters, awhile,
said Milbourne to those who were pressing at his side,
seeing that it is not our custom, that in a period so rife
with dangers as this, the passages of the Council should
be spread abroadmeaning no hurt to you friends, who
I doubt not are trusty and affectionate unto us; but ye
cannot blame, when wisdom lies in secrecy, and safety
follows cautionthat a request be made that forthwith
ye leave us; but ere ye go, bear with ye in your minds
that we are grateful for your loves and kind adherence,
and be no man loth to report among the worthy burghers
of the city that Fort William contains their foes; it will
doubtless be of pleasant savour to their hearing.
At this bidding, slowly and with lingering steps those
who had no authority to remain departed, for however
respectful the order to leave the place had been worded,
still it was a direct order, and one neither, from
circumstances
attached to the person who gave it, to be
disobeyed
or questioned; the reluctance with which it was
fulfilled, therefore, was plainly evident, for it had in one
instant, destroyed expectant curiosity, it had put to flight,
at a breath, the hopes of some and the greedy malignancy
of others; and besides, the desire to learn what would be
going forward in the Council was excited and increased
by the knowledge of the fact that it was a secret
proceeding
there
were those who had set their hearts at
gaining
a sight of the prisoners and of their bearing, of
hearing
what would be their fate, and how other matters that
might be broached would be settled; and there were
those who had already planned all that was to take place
and be said on every subject, and were only anxious to
behold
the confirmation of their workto all these, quitting
the objects on which their hearts were fairly set, was
peculiarly hard; as severe as rending a sculptor from his
favourite statue, the model of all he deemed perfect; the
painter from his prize picture, or the dashing at one fell
swoop to earth, the loved day dreams of the youthful
enthusiast
on
the females who had been present in particular, it
had fallen harshly, and as they went, like Eve driven from
the gates of Eden, they cast many a lingering look behind;
yet in their disappointment they soon found consolation in
determining, with the usual fervour of the sex, that they
would still ere long taste the forbidden fruit; and true such
resolves more than once had heretofore provedfor it was
a most extraordinary thing how the acts of the legislators
of the Nieuw Nederlandts were published as they were,
almost as soon as formed: and although many a
burgomaster
,
who was taciturn in his seat in the redschap, was put to
his wit's end to avoid the queries of his helpmate, yet the
next day, or even sooner, after deliberations charged as
the most secret, they were in the mouths of every body
from the hay-scales to the baardschreeder's winkel,
yet there was no one who had been entrusted but what
denied his having been faithless; and so it may well be
supposed, that many a curtain lecture in the instance that
is treated of was threatened, and among those of the most
consequence was one in embryo in the bosom and fast
swelling tongue of dame Leislerwho considered
herself
ill treated on all sidesfirst in the little deference
that had been paid her by the company, and to her
smelling
bottle, cowslip wine, and poppy water, by her
son-in-law
and
lastly, in what appeared to her ideas of
etiquette
,
her being fairly turned out of a room in her own
house; but although in this last matter her passion raged
loftily, she had made up her mind to the inconvenience,
on reflecting that there was an excellent situation for
listening in a neighbouring chamber, the key-hole of the
door of which was of such advantageous dimensions, that
necessarily all that was enacted must be overheard.
All having retired except those whose presence was
allowed by virtue of their offices, the chosen advisers of
the ruler of the puissant colony of New Yorke, took
their several places,and to them Milbourne related more
minutely in circumstance, that having suspicions that the
morning's disturbance arose from interested instigators,
who must have been in person sowing disaffection among
the people, who had heretofore been submissive to
Leisler's
authorityby judicious stratagems he had been
enabled
to trace the steps of the two most inveterate foes
of his family, unsuspected by them until too late;in
short, by a well devised operation, he had, assisted by
his partisans, surrounded those discordant rousers of
rebellion
at a moment when they had expected they were
in the full tide of success, and had arrested them with
a warrant on a charge of high treasonthey had been
conducted as captives in a public and ignominious way
from the house of one of their followers, and in their
progress
to the fort there had been a desperate though vain
attempt for their rescue, and this last had caused the
almost always tranquil city of Nieuw Amsterdam to have
its peace disturbed in the manner heretofore set forth.
As Milbourne concluded, exultation sat on the grim and
gloomy faces of the Councillors. A brief silence
followed
;
each seemed to wait, fearful to break the deadly
pause, as if depending on an expression of the sentiments
of another, to confirm the dark intentions of his own soul.
He hath said we were but dirt; not worth the
trampling
of his boot heel, muttered Peiter De Lanoy, a leader
of the Council, sternly compressing his lips as he spoke,
out on his pride; how will he do now when the dirt
hath closed about his throatan it may be he'll sink
beneath
it like one in the quicksands of the sea.
He hath said the scum of the people have thrust
themselves in all places of trust and power, echoed
another.
He hath called us hounds, not fit to lick his kitchen
Vol. II. 6
trenchershe hath loaded us, young and old, with
contumely
and scorn, followed a venerable looking man,
who was named Edsell, of Queens county.
Who but he opposed our march, and forced us to
fight our road step after step? Who but he stirred up
against us Dirk Wessels and Claes Ripse, and Schuyler,
the Albanians? Hath he not hardened the proud Van
Kortlandt against our overtures? Hath he not been like
the leper's sore, that hath widened like a death mark
among us? cried Milbourne, who had watched his
opportunity
and now malignantly sought to increase the
force of the gathering tempest: but there is a change
in the swift and smooth flowings of his fortunes; he is in
our hands.'
Aye, the best blood that riots in his veins would not
go far to repay the injuries he hath done our cause,
quoth Gerardus Beekman, of Kings county, his dark brows
meeting in a threatening frown.
His blood! his blood! he would have taken ours an
he could; but we hold him, so let him look to his head,
burst forth from several, who added determinate gestures
to their words.
A stern deep hum of assent and approbation ran from
lip to lip.
Myn beszer vreints, I dink so; dou dink doo,
advised
the governor himself, addressing his associates with
a look of wise prudence and moderation, By myne
trouwe! derevor, I pelieves dat is goot, dis duegenuit
dalk mit his taal vor hish drote vor ont hond wat Ik zeg;
ven his drote is gut droo his kopt daar is geen helpen
aan, op myne vord, I dink wat I zay.
Let the prisoners be brought before us, said several
of the Council.
Ho! who waits there? drag the culprits to their
judgment seat, called out Milbourne passionately.
There was a stirless and solemn silence for the space
of a minute throughout the apartment,at the sharp voice
of Milbourne's imperious command, there was a sudden
cessation
of speaking even among such as were holding with
their friends or coadjutors a secret consultation of what
course was the most profitable to pursue in the
momentous
affair before them; as the captive's guard showed
himself at the doorway and announced their coming, at
once all discussion ceased, and so deep was the pause that
one might have heard the wood worm's death watch in
the oakened and pannelled wainscot. All looked
anxiously
and with dark and expectant visages towards that
door; by and by, there came the heavy and harsh
clank of chains, and the quick trampling, and clash of
the footsteps of armed men; it came near, and both the
captives having a hardy looking and whiskered soldier of
the adelborsten at his side, armed and fully accoutered,
with his long traphaan and his bandelier girded about him,
were conducted before the Council of their foemen. The
first was a tall, thin, sallow man, with a high pile of
forehead
,
and large and prominent features; his head was
somewhat bald and bare, yet the few locks that kept their
place were of a dark hue untouched by years; his dress
was very plain, indeed it might have been accounted
mean for one of his lofty bearing, for though in the
servitude
of irons, his eagle eye glanced around with as
haughty a gaze as a leader urging on the pursuit, and his
tread was as stately and as firm as though in that hall he
strode to meet the greetings of victory instead of the
derision
of his conquerors; his brow was faintly wrinkled,
though his person was unbent and straight as a turret, so
that he might have been compared to one of those
ancient
monuments, which time's half shadows half displays;
this was Bayard, the proud Bayardclose behind him
stood the other, his companion in misfortune, of a younger
look and prepossessing countenance, though scarce
attracting
the eye which was irresistibly fixed, from the moment
of his entrance, on the unbowing figure at his side.
Nicholas Bayard and Walter Nichols, said De
Lanoy
,
you are arraigned before this Council, composed
of the chosen representatives of the province of
New-Yorke
,
and the true supporters of the glorious
revolution
,
charged with levying arms against the king, and that,
instigated by a vile and wicked spirit of opposition, you
have obstructed the faithful authorities and subjects of
the realm from rendering their just allegiance to the
protestant
successor of the throne, and have withal,
traitorously
joined in rebellion against the people. What
answers
have you to make? Dare you, can you, sirs, disown
these high crimes?
Sirs, before your questions be satisfied, replied
Bayard
,
I do demand at whose command, by what
authorized
power, nay, I would say, by what law, have you
erected
this pretended tribunal? where is your charter for it?
and on what legal warrant am I detained here, in bonds
fitted alone for the culprit robber, or murderer? Why, I
say again, is a burgher, free and born among you, dragged
felon-like, as guilty of some lawless crime, from the
peaceful
dwelling of his friends into this presence? Behold
these ignominious chains, alike upon my comrade there;
Who is the man that dares thus violate the dearest
privilege
of life, liberty? I repeat it, sirs, by what right am I
thus held?
Do your words seek us in scorn, or is your demand
serious, Nicholas Bayard? inquired De Lanoy sternly.
Ye can take it, sirs, even as ye are most willing to use
it, responded the other in a firm though sneering tone.
Hear him; he despises us! hear him; he contemns
our power! cried several of the Council in anger.
Milbourne started threateningly from his seat, Down
with his overweening pride. Nicholas Bayard, you do
forget yourself, said he in a voice of rage, we are no
more your slavesbethink ye, haughty sir, whose
manacles
you wear.
Speak to those who'll hear you, sir, replied Bayard
scoffingly, for I am used to mate with my equals; not
such as thou art.
By all the pains of hell! thundered the other, I'll
rip thy
Peace, brother Milbourne, peace! calm thine anger,
however just, quoth De Lanoy, restraining his upraised
arm; this doth offence unto the dignity of this sitting;
let us pursue our duty with the prisoner.
'Tis well, Nicholas Bayard, that you are a bondsman,
or I had robbed the hangman of his office, said
Milbourne
,
as he resumed his place. Bayard smiled, but
answered not a word.
Prisoners, you stand before the Lieutenant Governor
of his Majesty's province of New Yorke, continued De
Lanoy, aided by his sworn and tried Council; in the
absence of the former constituted rulers, by commission
from the lords Carmarthen,Halifax,and others, Jacob
Leisler
is empowered to take care for preserving the peace
and for administering the laws, until our high and mighty
sovereign, William of Orange, King of England, with
further
and other orders
I bow most humbly to thy swelling preamble of my
judge's titles, Peiter DeLanoy, returned Bayard ironically;
yet with such sufficient command of features, that his
feelings were scarcely discoverable. But I am an
ignorant
mantherefore mayhap to enlighten me on my
darkness of mind, the wise and potent counsellor who
hath addressed me, will explain to me from whence his
excellency derived his commission once again; albeit
I am growing oldmy ear may have deceived me; was
it said commissioned Governor?
Ah, Bayard! said Milbourne quickly, he did say
commissionedand what dare you say against it?
Oh nothingnothing, replied Bayard carelessly,
when it is backed by a bravo's dagger.
Sirs! is this insolence to be tolerated? cried
Milbourne
,
choaking with passion.
For shame Captain Milbourne! restrain this violence,
said De Lanoy temperately.
He has insulted one and all presentlet him be
remanded
,
said several of the council speaking
tumultuously
at one breath.
Nay Sirs! answered De Lanoy, it were not well
we should thus lose temper at his gibeswe are a calm,
deliberating court and by this conduct the accused
criminal
doth but enlarge his guilt; yet, it is fit we should go
on with his examination, keeping his own rash words as
evidences against him`for out of his mouth,' as it is
said, `let his judgment come.' Prisoners, listen to what
charges are preferred at you!
6*
One word, interrupted Bayard, pardon for my
stopping you. You have termed us prisonersI do allow
itthese irons speak the truth of such term; but ere you
proceed, I repeat, that I will not answer to one sentence
that you put to me, unless, as once before I intimated,
you do solve to me your master's commissionwhich
neither have I heard, nor do I believe exists;and, what
is more than all, I'll wage my right hand that no such
hath been given by the king. To whatsoever legal
dignity
Jacob Leisler boasts, I will cheerfully submit; but to
any self-assumed office, as a loyal subject, I cannotnay,
by the living heavens! I will not subscribe the least
knowledge.
I am struck dumb by his unparalleled impudence
who hath heard the like! said the voice of the council,
after a pause of astonishment.
Colonel Bayard, do you know you are throwing away
life as it were a thing not worth keeping, pursued De
Lanoy.
He is a madmangive him to the tortures! the
provost-marshal's
thong will cool in short count his hot-headed
pride, quoth divers of the members in great wrath.
Nicholas Bayard, you and your companion have
despised
us, outspoke Milbourne loudly, and rising in his seat
with vehement gestures, have questioned the stations
we hold with a degree of scorn that becomes your other
actions
;
and that, plain as the hand writing on the wall, hath
shown your hearts. It were needless, as are the feelings
of this tribunal of your judges, to go on and hear you
defend
,
or trouble ourselves to prove your crimessuffice
it to say ere I give my vote, which you may well believe
is for death on all traitors, that you well know that in this
room there sits not a man who is not more than your equal.
We are your peers, haughty Sir! and I would advise, an
you desire to show sense, that you no more carry your
head higher than it can well bear. Remember, Sir, an
your loftiness can so far reflect, that the most soaring
branch of the forest, is the most like to be swept to earth
and the hangman's cord hath tightened round a nobler
neck than thine, Nicholas Bayard.
Methinks I hear the busy anger and the puny hum of
an insignificant and spiteful wasp, exclaimed Bayard,
calmly and proudly turning from Milbourne, you see,
Sirs, his sting is venomous; but I am not ruffled by an
insect.
By my soul's welfare! roared the other, nearly
bursting with uncontrollable rage, but I'll rive that
tongue of thine from its roots.
As he shouted these words he was about to rush upon
the captive, but many of the Council arose from their
places and withheld him, foaming with revenge and ire.
Mien vriends, 'tis to nien burbose dat dis mensch ish
sbeak mit, quoth the governor, vor you zee zo as I
zee dat he maaks mien zon Yakoop kill himzel mit hish
gramschap; derevor tis regt dat you laat hem met
vreede.
Tis said true, that this cavilling doth ill become us,
responded De Lanoy, and the prisoner doth provoke
his own hurt.
Nay, dost think I fear a thing such as him? said
Bayard with a smile of contempt, let him aloneI am
rather old and chained, but that's no matterI do not
tremble at him. Sirs, do not think I would descend to
make myself so low as to bandy more words with such a
tricked ape:'sdeath! I should have fallen indeed were
it so. I will not, therefore, seek his malicethough I
despise itI have nothing to do with him. But sirs,
to you of this self-constituted council I speak now, for I
do consider that by this my detention you do grievously
offend against the acknowledged rights of an English
subject; and mark you, knowing you have neither
privilege
for the outrage that in my person you have committed,
nor the seal or signature of any one except your own
besotted
ambition for thus forming yourselves into a court of
authorized
powers, as ye wish to appearI do caution you
how you proceed in any further violence against my friend
in durance and myself, so you may go through what forms,
trickeries, and make-game of trial you please, I shall no
more oppose you; and if you are bent on my blood I
care nottake it, I will not flinch from the axe that you
may guide against my head; deeming from my bold
opposition
to what in your pursuit of power I term treason, I
have to expect little mercy from men who, to effect their
unlawful purposes have openly and wantonly leagued
with pirates and cut-throat robbers, and who are no
better
themselves than vile, disloyal traitors.
Tis not worth our time to answer you; but from
you we must not listen to another sentence, said De
Lanoy, Secretary, read over the charges against
Nicholas Bayard and William Nichols.
Nicholas Bayard and William Nichols, hearken to
me, read Abraham Gouverneur, for such was the name of
the governor's secretary, you, Nicholas Bayard, it is here
laid unto you, have vilely and with selfish cupidity sought
and monopolized, in the late government of this province,
every office of honour and profit; that you have
avariciously
and dishonestly used the emoluments of such
places, and indeed the public monies that have passed in
your hands, to enrich your own private purse, to
maintain
your relations and partizans, and have turned that
very wealth so obtained against the colony; that you
have, with those arch traitors Van Kortlandt, Schuyler,
French, Wanham, Wessels, and others equally malignant,
disturbed the peace of this his Majesty's province of
New-Yorke, and have encouraged them, if not borne
arms yourself against the established authority; and have
acted otherwise in these matters most seditiously: in all of
which enormities, you, William Nichols, have wantonly
aided and abetted him; and for which you are now both
in custody, under warrant of high treason. And unless
you have withal to prove your innocence instantly, such
is the dreadful state to which your rebellious plans have
convulsed the province, that the council have
commanded
me to announce to you, that without further trial or
inquiries they consider there is proof sufficient to
condemn
you to death:how say you?
Both Bayard and his companion were silent, and
returned
not a motion in answer, but stood firm and
composed
.
I do not wonder at this conduct, said De Lanoy,
partly addressing the Council and partly the prisoners,
it is but natural for one of such an ambitious nature to
act, even at such a moment as this, as he has ever borne
himself; though loaded with guilt, though conscious of
the people's indignation, he has a pride to tower amid
crimes like the rebel angel. Speak Bayard, acknowledge
that you have been alone guided by ambition and the most
pitiful envy in your actions; for while you have been
grinding
the colony of its very marrow, revelling in the profits
of the numerous offices you wrested by sycophancy and
intrigue from more deserving men; while you held
yourself
above your fellow burghers with a pride insufferable,
catering, spaniel-like, to the libidinous pleasures, that in
their eyes you might have favour, of the licentious tyrants
that a bigotted monarch had deputised to rule over us;
hath not Jacob Leisler, our worthy compeer, and his
friends, strove and laboured with the very strength of
their bodies and their fortunes for the weal of the
province
;
seeking at every moment of life to unlock the
fetters
such as you and yours were rivetting upon us? and
we have done it; and urged by that wicked idea, that
since you could not equal you would destroy, have you
not afterwards gone on?shame! was it not too late after
the fight was ended, the victory won, for you to step
forward
and tell that your heart had been ever with the good
cause; (why then not act?) but that you despised its
leaders, because we were not of such descent as you
considered
the nobility of the land, the patentees of
governors
,
the Livingstons, the Schuylers, the Rombouts,
and such who had more pride and money than honour or
honesty. Have you not, recreant, on such foundation for
hatred, pursued the path of a false traitor? Have you
not opposed the progress of the protestant revolution?
Have you not scattered rebellion in every furrow you
could lay open to receive it? Have you not now been
taken in the very act for which you are arraigned?
Answer
Have
you and your abettors, such as this tool
Nichols here, not done this and more than this I have
accused you of, and plainly, from what motive,to
gratify
disappointed pride; to thrust yourself in power for
which you had neither claims nor desert.
It were almost needless for me to say what you
must perceive, that as well as Colonel Bayard, I neither
recognize your powers here as a Court, nor do I deem it
necessary to seek your mercy, replied William Nichols,
therefore you but spend your breath, and may at once
as well do your worst.
They do not deny their guilt, pursued De Lanoy,
your voices, sirs; shall we proceed to pass sentence of
death upon the traitors?Secretary, fill the warrant.
One or two members hesitated, but the majority of the
Council bowed their heads at the words of De Lanoy in
token of approbation: for a moment among all, there was
a stern and solemn silence, unbroken except by the slight
sound of the pen with which the Secretary was swiftly
filling up the death warrant. The captives, with arms
enfolded, unbent, unmoved, gazed without the quivering
of a nerve upon the solemn preparation, in whose
procedure
their lives appeared so intimately concerned. At
this important juncture, the door of the chamber was
opened
of a sudden, and an officer of the hoofdwagt stood in
the entrance.
Whence is this intrusion, Sir, exclaimed Milbourne
angrily, at a time when the Council are sitting with
closed doors? How now, Sir?
Pardon, good Sirs, answered the officer, I would
not have presumed, but there are two without, an Indian
and a boy, who urge to be introduced, being bearers as
they say of intelligence, at once of moment, alarming, and
important.
Keep silence! for your tongue's too free; ejaculated
Milbourne, sternly: Whatsoever it may be, they must
wait. See you not, Sir, we are engagedbusied, I say
begone! though see they depart not till here we end.
The soldier however lingered, How now, Sir, why do
you stay? is there ought for you to do?
These persons tell me, Sir, that the matter must be
instantly known to the Governor, which they seek to
communicate, and so momentous is it, they say, that
unless instantly acted on, the cause may be destroyed and
our enemies triumphant.
Ha! what can this mean? exclaimed many of the
Council, they had best be heard.
Not until Bayard's death warrant is signedsealed
irrevocably! cried Milbourne impetuously.
Zon, Yaakoop Milbourne, said Leisler, myn vreints
zay dese mensch must sterven, dat is, dieI must zay
zo. By myne trouwe dough, I dinks 'tis well to be kool
in de matters, zo I dink de Indiaan and der jongen must
inkoomen, und het most noodzaaklyk zoo zyn.
You may admit these importunate strangers, said
De Lanoy.
The officer withdrew, but in a few seconds returned,
accompanied by the Indian and the boy, who have before
filled so conspicuous a part in this narrative.
Well, stripling, for the attainment of what object,
sought Milbourne, at an hour so unseasonable, have you
intruded on us?
My business was with the Governor, and with him
alone. I entered here not thinking to meet all these who
set around me.
Boy, this is but idle, exclaimed De Lanoy
impapatiently
,
if your reports are of a nature that interests
the public welfare, to one and all here it should be known
without evasion; if it is, after all, but some private
communication
,
you have done wrongyou have highly
trespassed
on our patience, and richly deserve punishment
for your audacity in thus thrusting yourself and follower
on us at a time when we were debating on life and death.
On life and death? repeated the boy in a voice
thrilling and anxious, and directing his eyes on the
prisoners
,
then I have come in time. I see it now,forbear,
I do forbid you to imbrue your hands in the blood of those
men who stand manacled before you; touch not a hair of
their heads draw not an angry sword against them; for
your own safety forbear them; harm them not as you wish
for life yourselves.
Rash youth! how dost thou darewhat hath sent
thee here? exclaimed De Lanoy in amazement.
How hath this thing of idiocy been allowed to come
within this presence? ejaculated Milbourne.
The prisoners should have been withdrawn, nor have
met the sight of this strange madman, echoed another.
Nay, friends of Jacob Leisler, think me not mad, nor
look on me as a foe, for there is not among you one who
loveth in his heart you aged man, whom you have dressed
in robes of power, like unto me, and soon ye will know
it, said the boy, for even in what I now advise, that
the lives of Bayard and his associate be spared; I speak
for the good of allhear what I have to say, then judge
mebut first let your prisoners be withdrawn, for what I
have to tell is not as yet for their hearing.
The ragged losel speaks far above his condition,
said De Lanoy, shall it be granted, Sirs?
A consent to their being removed having been obtained,
Bayard and Nichols were conducted out of hearing.
Now you have your wish, said Milbourne hastily,
after the departure of the prisoners, be quick and
explicit
in what you have to say, and see it be of
consequence
,
that you would fain have it, for the doings of
men are not put off, nor their resolutions tampered with,
unpunished. So at once let us know all you have to
inform
this Council ofspeak boy!
Angerous sir, did not my kindness for your father
outweigh the insults of your unmannered haste, returned
the youth calmly, I might be tempted to remain in
silence
,
nor give a satisfaction to what you seek; but
though from you I lack encouragement, yet I want not
care for others who are here, and therefore intend not to
keep secret my knowledge. Sirs, it is well ye learn that
last night there landed on this island an officer from
England
,
deputed by the king as governor of this province
supplied with all necessary powers, papers and
authorities
,
to rule the people of this distracted colony.
It would be difficult to describe the varied feelings of
those present at this information. Astonishment, doubt,
fear and dread were depicted in every visage. Some
started from their seats, not knowing what they were
doing
others
fell back on their settles, pale and amazed
the eyes of all were on the boy.
Can this be certain, inquired one at length.
I swear most true; as heaven is my judge I speak
not false, answered the stripling, and here is one
this Indian, who can confirm what I have told to you.
And who are you, questioned Milbourne at the
savage.
I am one who, like a lingering ember of the council
fire, lives through loving not life after my race hath
expired
,
replied the red man in a voice of sorrow, low and
mournful, I am one who, like the last stalk that remains
in the field after the tempest is past, hath no joy that it is
spared, to be a lonely emblem of desolation. The grave
I seek will soon be my habitation, for with grief hath the
strength of my arm grown to decay, and I feel my feet
will no more serve me in the chaceyet I know the
truth of the brave youth who hath spoken with you of
the Corlear.
[10]
[10]
This name was given by the savages from respect to the
governors
of the province of New-Yorke, from a person so called, who
was drowned in Lake Champlain.
Brothers, the White Skinned Beaver tells
not a lie, his lips have ever been white with truth.
This is most strange intelligencehave none heard
of this before? sought De Lanoy.
In coming hither it had almost slipt my memory, so
little credence gave I to the story, said one of the
counsellors
;
there was placed in my hand, in a most soiled
and wretched state, a paper: an epistle purporting to be
from one who styles himself Tribulation Wholesome, and
signifies himself as my protestant friend and well wisher,
who states, that last night, towards the city he journeyed
in company with one who he has reason to believe was a
person of consequence, albeit a man from beyond sea.
In his language he calls him a `crowned Saul, anointed
to rule over our Israel.' Deeming it the effusion of some
busy madmanthough lucre, for what in his opinion
seems most valuable information, appears to be his
object
,
I scarce perused it; but its contents have
returned
upon my mind in confirmation of what is now told
us. Natheless at its reception I was fain to pass it,
unable
to fathom its sense or bearing.
Vol. II. 7
An this be as is said, there will be clouds above us,
said one.
Clouds! rather say a tempest hath begun which will
sing our dirge, exclaimed another.
The hounds upon our coast must have grown weary
of the scent of blood, muttered a third.
Or who knows but the other party may have paid
heaviest, and promised more than we have, whispered
a fourth, robber, pirate, devil, all he thinks or seeks for
is gold, gold.What is to be done?
Sirs, ye seem struck with amaze, cried Milbourne
impatiently, what matters all this; shall it save Bayard?
have we not voted his deathshall he not die?
We should be cautious, Captain Milbourne, in what
we do, quoth one or two of the council.
As we have not notice of this new governor's coming
may it not be that he is favourable to Bayard and his
friends, joined others.
We must do nothing rash, it is not safe nor prudent;
nay, it becomes us to do nothing rash, echoed many of
the members.
By heaven, sirs! this would wreck the patience of
virtue itself, cried Milbourne, rising exasperated from
his settle, what means this change among you? Do I
hear you aright? are you men of soul and heart, or are
you like the craven, who boasts that he fears not dangers
but when they confront him he trembling hides his
recreant
head? What hath wrought this change among
you? Admit the truth of what these persons tell us
what doth it avail to us? Are ye heart stricken at the
step of a man of whose authority we yet know nothing?
How if these here, who have so busied themselves, are
hired by our enemies to hatch this tale? What, are you
palsiedare you stricken to slaves at the sound of an
approach
of a tyrantare you ready to throw down your
freedom, and like the timorous spaniel crouch at your
master's feet before you see him? Is it this we have
toiled and laboured forat an alarm to surrender at
discretion
all our rights? On my soul ye are a noble set,
startled by a shadowslain by a trumpet blast
conquered
by the description of a lance! It frets me to hear and
see you act thus:have you no firmnessno resolution
to dare and dieno spirit except such as actuates a
wanton
child, who after his mischief eager snaps at the first
moment of repentance? If it be true that King William
hath been so far misled, either by our enemies or by the
false faith of our envoy, Jost Stoll, to bestow the
government
of this province on other than my father,
ungratefully
forgetting his services towards the success of the
revolution
to which he owes his throneI say for one, let
us be well assured of our own safetyour livesour
dearest liberties, ere we tamely deliver up our present
power and sovereignty; if we have been dealt unfairly
by, we can guard ourselves from further wrongand we
have about us, in arms and means, enough to show those
who wish us ill, that we are able to bid them to their
teeth defiance. And to show the firmness of our
intentions
,
let the bloody heads of those two attainted and
condemned
traitors be placed at once upon the ramparts
towards
the city, so that their partizans may learn that
every step they take against our established rule, is with
the executioner's axe ready at their seditious throats.
Jacob Milbourne, I must speak for my own part, and
I may, I am assured, say, for that of most here present,
said Edsell, shaking with age as he spoke, there is none
of us who are wont to depart from the cause we pledge
ourselves to support, nor do I think such is the intention
now, and yet, under all circumstances, I have given it
more thought, I cannot assent to the death of these men;
nay frown not, nor look on me with flashing eyeyou are
a younger man than I am, you want experience, Sir, the
world is not learnt in a day; my head is white, quite
white, I lack a year of fourscore, and you see I tremble,
but mark, I affirm it, it is neither for fear of your
haughty
looks or living man; but ageage, Sir, hath a
wondrous
knack at unsettling a man's steadiness of limbs;
still it gives what want of years hath not, prudence, Sir,
and mayhap wisdom. I repeat it, I do not consider it
proper at this time to put in force our late determination
with respect to Nicholas Bayard and Walter Nichols.
And I answer you, passing your touches on youth and
inexperience, which is a chorus worn out by sly old
dotards to conceal their duplicity, replied Milbourne
fiercely striking his hand upon the haft of his rapier;
Albeit, youth be hot, stirring, and headstrong, age is
more in its cool reflection akin to rank cowardiceI do
proclaim it, nor will I recall the word, that he that backs
not the late decision, he that gainsays the resolve of
Bayard
and Nichols' execution, is not more than a
lukewarm
friend, or rather a rank foe to the cause and the house
of Jacob Leisler, and as well deserves to grace the provost
marshal's rope as the worst rebel that hath plotted with
Van Kortlandt against us; and now you have heard my
thoughts, where is the man that likes them not? The
Council rose from their seats.
If we are to be browbeat into opinions, we had
better
dissolve, said one.
If we are to have our voices forced from us by threats,
we may as well depart at once, exclaimed another.
The oldest man among us to be treated so? we had
as well be ruled by Bayard, added several.
Our master's wish is to be crammed down our throats
we are to have no will, followed others.
For the love of Heaven, Sirs; for our own sakes,
Milbourne, Edsell, hear me, Sirs, hear me, interposed
De Lanoy, what are you about? will you destroy
yourselves
?
Will you, like the Eastern bird, suck your own
blood? What are you about to do? Anger is of a
moment's
birth, but of years in lifethis is wild, wild! Do
not for this idle bickering sacrifice the dearest interests
of us all. Edsell, you know Milbourne is quick and taketh
fire like the dried leaves of the last winterMilbourne,
though you may suppose wrong hath been, there is
something
due to age. Do not act like madmen; this is a time
you should forget all fueds; a time when things like this
should be far from our assemblage. If it be so that an
armed enemy approaches from without, is it politic that
within our walls we raise sharp weapons against our own
bosoms, and give, by our own hands, victory without the
levelling of an adverse spear.
Mien vreints, dis iz pad; dis dosh kreib mien zeil

Myne zon, Yaakoop Milbourne, mien regt hand is gut,
mien vreint, Edsell, be gool; mien vreints, I ish gilt mit
dis und't staat in u lieder magt me te behouden.
Although both Leisler and De Lanoy anxiously exerted
themselves to soothe the wounded feelings of the
exasperated
assembly, and heal the breach which had so
imprudently been made by the fiery and unreflecting
Milbourne, it was some time ere matters were adjusted,
so that the members resumed their places: and even
then in most bosoms there had come a change of heart
towards their leader. Like a drop of spreading and
virulent
poison in the wholesome liquor of the goblet, had
been the words that had dropt from the disputants' lips;
and, unmindful of every consequence, actuated by the
fiery torch that lighted their breasts, they gazed at each
other with scornful eyes; and the sharp look of contempt
and hate alternately moved their swelling features:
indeed
,
the hearts of many were weaned from the cause
they might have heretofore ardently espousedthe blade
was unsheathed, the deadly and parting blow had been
given, and low, dark whispers passed between Edsell and
his friends; and besides, there were some, on whom the
conduct of Milbourne had no impression, and these were
by far of the greatest number present, who sat as friends
of Leisler for the last time, although now their hearts, (if
they had such things,) were harassed by hopes and fears,
waiting but for a certainty of the intelligence that had
been communicated, to fly the party which they now,
in their interested calculations, deemed must inevitably
fall; and among these were many who had been nothing
but for Leisler; who, from the base dunghills of their
birth, had warmed themselves to influence in his smiles;
yea, those, as in the like cases, on whom the greatest
favours had been heapedwho had really sworn to live
and die by the fortunes of their patron, with faith and
oath as light as the dip of the rower's oar, striking the
water, fickle as lovers' anger, and as quickly forgot,
were the first to plan his destruction, and the first to
prepare
7*
to desert him in his adversity, even before that
adversity was fairly at his side, with her lean and iron
hand to pull him to the earth. Yet it must be said, there
were some, (though these were few,) who if not grateful
for former protection, felt that their chance hung on the
faction to which they had attached themselves; for so
zealous
had been their faith, that little mercy was for them to be
looked for, should their opponents succeed: and with the
resolute ambition of the condemned criminal, who, at the
scaffold's brink puts on the look of unconcern and courage,
unwinking of eye and untrembling in step, ambitious
even in wrongthey were firm and resolved in purpose
to brave the worst, in very despair. In a short time, the
attention of the Council was again engrossed with the
Indian and his youthful companion. Stripling, inquired
Beekman of the boy, were you aware of what
consequence
was this that you have told us? For what
reason
have you made yourself so officious and interested in
this business? Have you been stimulated by an
expectancy
of reward?or beware how you attune your young
lip to falsehood!have you lent yourself to forward the
designs of others?
Hast thou wantonly lied, child, confess; fiercely
spoke Milbourne, for an thou deceivest on this
matter, by my soul, thy shrift shall be short, and thy
gallows as high a one as ever stood on the commons.
It were better for thee, youngster, an thou hast been
employed by the adherents of the unfortunate and
condemned
men who have been remanded hence at thy
coming, under sentence of death, by this as a stratagem to
save them, that thou tellest true; for thou hast put thyself
within the serpent's den, and if it prove not as thou hast
said, albeit, thy life hast thou thrown away, as it were, a
pebble, worthless, and to be picked from the ground as
soon as cast there, sternly added De Lanoy.
Thou seed of ill! who art thou? As I do look upon
thee, there is something that striketh me I have beheld
thee, ere now;where has it been? cried Milbourne
again, suddenly and abruptly speaking before the boy could
answer the questions that had been asked of him, at the
same time approaching close to him, and strongly
grasping
his shoulder,by the life of me, thou seemest like
one I should know, yet I doubt; though sooth wert thou
an angel that hast stepped between Bayard and
destruction
,
it shall not save him.
White man, the claw of the panther is too heavy
for the neck of the gentle fawn, exclaimed the savage,
as he struck the arm of Milbourne roughly from its
hold on the youth. If you love the blood that
sports round thy heart, harm not the brave youth
by thy touch of anger; for did Quider

The name given to Major Schuyler of Albany, instead of Peter,
which they could not pronounce. Speaking of Schuyler, Smith
says, he had so great an influence over them (the savages,) that
whatever he recommended or disapproved had the force of a law;
this power over them was supported, as it had been obtained, by
repeated
offices of kindness.

himself lay
the weight of the wild bird feather on him, and the White
Skinned Beaver was at hand, he would put the chain of
friendship with the nation in the ground forever, and his
tomahawk should drink his life as greedy as the wolf laps
the waters of the spring.
What, would the Indian dog slay me? ejaculated
Milbourne, retreating in surprise. Why,ho!who
stands on guard?
As Milbourne uttered these words with something like
alarm in his motion, he repeated his call in summons to
the attendants who might be in waiting without the
apartment
,
to secure this unexpected and determined
adversary
,
lest his dangerous threat should be put in force.
The youth, however, interposed in favour of his wild and
dauntless friend.
Be not in such haste, Jacob Milbourne, said he,
thou hast started without cause; there is no need of
fear nor of the presence of a myrmidon at thy side, to
lend thee an arm's defence. I trust from us thou shalt
have no harm; in sooth, I have been most ready to accord
to thy seeking all that I were able; albeit, rude forms
and ruder words are not wont to obtain speedy answers.
On my soul, youngster, methinks thou carriest a
most lofty guise that doth belie thy ragged jerkin, said
De Lanoy, regarding the stripling with a look of wonder
and inquiry, either thou hast little deference for the
presence thou art in, or, as your language,your looks
declare, and as before I shrewdly have suspected, thou
art other than thou seemest.Speak, sir, without
prevarication
,
for such here shall not serve your designwho
are you, and why thus disguised? We are not to be
played with; be brief, and let us know your meaning?
Ja! mien menschdat's mien goot klein mensch
sbeak, eagerly added Leisler himself, who for some
time had been gazing on the boy with evident and
increasing
emotion, and was apparently moved by a
doubtful
and uncertain interest, attracted by the familiar looks
of the object of his observation. He anxiously leaned
forward to catch the reply, and to scan more minutely,
the features of the stripling. Mien zeil! I ish in der
groot berblexidy: I ish in twyfel staan; dou sdardles
mien hertz mit dien stem, dien vace, mien got, nien!
het is niet zo. Om God's wille sbeak mien klein mensch.
It is not in vain sirs, that you have called on me to
unfold the character I bear, replied the boy; for with
you it seems most questionable; yet you that thus seek
at me have stood even in your own light, for had the
chance heretofore been free, I had not been backward in
my relationhowbeit, the words have swelled unto my
lips from the moment of my entrance, and I do confess,
so eager have I been, that my heart yearned against the
suppression that my utterance hath received; nor do I
now refuse to answer you; for I am one of all that
wanton
fortune hath ever frowned on most to meet your
commiseration
.
You look on me in wonder; your eyes gaze
with strange glances upon me, as though even on the
onset you would doubt that which I would tell. Yet
believe me, though thus young of years, smooth of brow,
and tender of form, my short life hath been too poor a
sacrifice to appease with its unceasing misery the
inveterate
malice of unrelenting misfortune. He that liveth
on in sorrow without change, forgets the name of
happiness
,
becomes inuredyea, gloats in pleasure in his
wretchedness, and finds enjoyment in his melancholy
course of tearsanother state to such who never
counted
on it, were to lose an accustomed companion; for
the death and danger that had clogged his weary steps
had engrafted with existence. But he who plunged in
trouble, hath his soul ever wrapt in hope, builds on the
hour of his release, and with pleased imagination, feasts
on the expected presence of the happiness to come;
whose only shadow brings more joy than all the
substance
of the world besides. And then think ye of his
wild despair, when he hath toiled unto the gates of his
high-wrought paradise, and sees them shut, even at the
moment he prepares to enter. His hope of day is gone;
night, irremediable night is on himthe chord on which
his being hung is snapt in twain:like the mother, who
inconsolable, hath raised the death song over the carved
gravestone of her first born, all that he doted on hath
departed
forever. Nay, sirs, you bend dark brows upon
me, and your lips mutter with impatience: bear with me but
awhile, for this is not an idle allegory to dally with your time
hear my tale, then judge me:for a few brief months
have scarcely flitted away unto the devouring bosom of the
past, since bliss and pleasure was my portionbliss, rather
such as is the envied lot of those who dwell in Elysian
bowers, than the chance of persecuted humanity; (what
can exceed?) wealth and luxury were mine, fond and
anxious parents, and troops of admiring friends
surrounded
my course of life, like the gay clouds, that tinged with
ethereal glory, hang in many coloured masses about the
path of the day god. But this hath not lasted; it is
gone by and left its memory alone, faint, though beautiful
as marble, seen but by the moonlight ray. Fate so
appointed
,
that to perfect the interest of my family, I left
my home, to seek beyond the dark and dangerous seas, a
ruling clime to which that of my birth was tributary. I
left my home, and returned, but worn and wasted by the
passages through which I had gone. Think then of my
misery, when having escaped the most fearful and
unheard
of dangers, the repetition of which alone would
freeze the blood, I stood within the hall where I parted
from my family's arms, glowing with affection; albeit, in
that very hall and presence I was unknown, unrecognised,
a stranger unmeet for greetings of love.
Mien Got! mien groot got! cried Leisler, starting
in great agitation from his seat; ish mien eysh regt,
does ik zee regtmien kind!mien schildt!mien zon!
During the time that the youth had been speaking, the
stout frame of the Governor shook with emotion; now
he passed his trembling hands across his brows as if to
awaken recollection, while his quick and eager sight read
with fast recognition through the changes that hardship
had wrought on the well known countenance of the
stripling
;
and now he drew back irresolute, for doubt at times
usurped, for could he believe that squalid garb robed the
frame of his favourite offspring? could he trace in those
hollow and wan features darkened by the exposures to
wind and sun, the white and tender lily of his garden?
that voice so sweet, so thrilling, like the notes of wanton
birds carolling as they swim in the summer's downy
atmosphere
,
had changed to a tone deeper and manlier than
he had been accustomed to hear it; and in truth but few,
in that feeble and emaciated child, a sapling, in its green
and growing years, over which the hurricane had went in
anger, could have remembered the gay and sportive boy,
whose eye shone in pleasantry, and whose cheek glowed
with health; indeed suffering and toil had worked such
difference in both form and face, that it would have taken
time, yea, for the mother that had borne him, to have
known the altered features of her child; but ere he had
heard him through, with outstretched arms and panting
heart, Leisler rushed forward from the place where he
had been seated
Father! dear father! cried the boy, and parent and
child tottered in each other's arms.
Mien Arnyte! mien kind! van ieder be minde, said
Leisler, folding the youth in a long and close embrace,
mien vlower von mien hertz! Art dou here in mien arm?
laat my zee in dien sveed vace, mien schildt.
Dear father! this is payment for all I have suffered;
your heart beats against mineyou did not forget your son.
Vorgets! mient Got! vorgets dee? nien, nien,
Arnyte
;
buts Ik did nien dink to zee dee, and dou beest
altered in dien vace, mien kind. Vorget! I weenen,
mien tears comsh vrom mien ogten at dien ward vorget
Arnyte, dou makes de vrouw mit mien ogten.
Good parent, said the stripling, pressing Leisler's
hand to his bosom, pardon my idle, foolish, weak
disguise
;
let it not give thee pain. That which I have
borne from others had made me act the child even with
thee; think not of itI am you know as yet but a mere
thoughtless boyI would not grieve thee for a moment,
or drive the slightest thorn into thy breast, so help me
heaven, to save my limbs from rack. Father, thy tears
are hot upon my forehead; let me kneel, and at thy feet
do penance for my rude, ungenerous conduct.
Op zyne knien, mien kind; nien, nien, mien arm shall
geeb dee virst at mien hertz.
And again and again the parent and the child were
held and entwined in each other's arms, and it was long
ere the unbounded raptures of this unexpected meeting
had subsided, so that the bystanders could interfere with
their gratulations, which, though many times sincere and
at least well meant from all, were but cold formalities to
the overflowing joy of Leisler and his son, who, for a
considerable
time after their very strength had become
exhausted
by their embraces, gazed with eyes sparkling
and swimming in tears on each other, and their hands
clasped together, scarce heeding aught around them; nor
did their full hearts find relief until both had wept like
infants: however, after some time their minds became
more composed, and the boy was addressed by others
who were present.
I am glad, right glad, to see thee, brother-in-law,
Arnyte
,
quoth Milbourne, howbeit, somewhat surprised,
for we had deemed thee now at Whitehall, furthering
with the new king our father's interest, though having
not heard from or of you, since first you sailed on such
important embassy; albeit, as I have always said, unmeet
for one so youngthere were those who went far to
whisper
a suspicion that you had as little care for the cause
as it was thought of ensign Jost Stoll who was sent out
before you, and who spent his time, instead of intriguing at
Hampton Court, among the rank pannels and canvass of
daubing limners.
Ever rude, ever unkind and harsh, retorted Arnyte
upraidingly was it well to taunt me with such
unfounded
accusations, which have their rise alone in your own
jealous and fretful brain, Jacob Milbourne;at a time like
this too? for shame! and still I thank you, for I will at
once to all here relate that which hath befel me, and show
that the business on which I was dispatched was
hindered
me by the hand of fate alone; for although the
vessel
in which I embarked, at first rode the cleaving tide
proud and safely as a warrior bestrides his noble charger,
yet we had scarce left the coast behind, ere the face of
the treacherous and smiling ocean changed, and soon a
dreadful tempest drove our bark to pieces and whelmed
all the life that had peopled its ribbed frame, except
myself
,
within the yawning deep; a scatterling of the wreck
to which, in my despair, I clung, bore at the mercy of the
destructive element my frame, until, almost but for this
restoration, I would say better had I perished than to be
so reserved, from the waters I was rescued by the rude
hand of a barbarous corsairin his bondage have I lived,
for having learnt my real name and rank, he considered
me a valuable hostage for the protection of his flag, and
in his hands I have endured to the full extent all that life
could bear: blows, wounds have I received, and
performed
for savage murderers the most menial offices; the
more cruel was the tasker's usage, as they believed me
harmless, wanting the most useful faculties of life, while
with hopes of escape, I encouraged their mistake, and of
such loss, when taken from the sea, my dreadful and
speechless state had given them a proof. I cannot tell
all that I have suffered: under the Indian sun, the
midnight
storm, the tornado of other climes, suffice, I have
dragged through all and yet am here. Late the
marauders'
route of plunder bent towards this, my own country,
and last night, on a secret enterprise, a select party
landed
from their floating den of blood and crime; I was taken
with themat the destined spot, the accustomed haunt
of Kid upon this island, this noble forester, journeying,
as I understand, after having slain a vile and deadly foe,
towards the river, craved the pirate's shelter; expecting
no hindrance in their purposes from one of his
appearance
it was not deniedthe object of the landing was
known to all the band, and relying on their error as to
my situation, they freely discussed their horrid intentions
before me, and I learned that a king's messenger, bearing
despatches to this province, with orders known to be
destructive
to the prosperity of the freebooters and their
upholders, had been early in the twilight set ashore at
Harleam, from a vessel that had arrived from England
and lay off the sound. By a planned stratagem, a person
in their interest guided the officer to the murderous hands
of the desperado, and whilst they were busied about his
capture, I found my Indian friend here was willing to assist
me if the opportunity offered for escape.
But this man! this messenger! speak! what of him?
what became of him? hastily interrupted De Lanoy.
From an incautious companion the rover had cause
to suspect him a person of some standing, and therefore
determined not to wet his steel with his blood, but to
bear him to some wild and desolate key in the Caribbean
Ocean, and there leave him to perish with a cruise of
water and a day's subsistence; for so the robber argued,
that as long as the life of a powerful man was not directly
taken by him, he should have little to count for, if it
should chance that justice should o'ertake him in his
wicked path. But Providence, through my weak means,
had ordered against the freebooter's designs, and ere
they searched him I managed to wile from his mistrustful
charge the documents the officer carried, and kept them
safe for him; while his disappointed captors urged against
him every brutal cruelty in their rage. And to convince
you that his rank was such as I have said, and which the
bandit had supposed, and that for my father's sake it was
well he was preserved, while in my possession a
document
loosened by accident from the package, and was so
forced on my observation: it contained directions of a
private nature from the Prime Minister of England to the
bearer, who was addressed by the name and title of
Colonel
Henry Sloughter, Governor of his Majesty's
Province
of New-Yorke, in North America, and therein he
Vol. II. 8
was requested on his arrival in this colony, to proceed
secretly and forthwith to the residence of Nicholas
Bayard, who was termed their Majesties' worthy and loyal
subject, and to consult with him on the surest method of
calming the disturbed and distracted province, and
bringing
peace to all parties
What, peace! he, Bayard, bring peace in the colony
ay, it would be such peace as wolves keep with lambs
signed in the best blood of his opposers, cried
Milbourne
furiously.
Are you sure the paper was as you relate, Arnyte
Leisler, sought many of the council.
I am not deceived in its purport, and am confirmed
by the conduct of Colonel Sloughter after our release
from the murderous grasp of Kid, that
Then he has escaped clear, unhurt from the rover's
ball and steelsafe did you say, inquired De Lanoy.
Thus far, Peiter De Lanoy, I am assuredthat the
credentials of Colonel Henry Sloughter, as Governor of
this province of New-Yorke, were publicly announced and
acknowledged by the adherents and followers of the
Bayard party, more than an hour past, and Governor
Sloughter himself hath placed his head quarters at
Bayard's Bouwerie for the present.
And this man, this Sloughter, pursued De Lanoy,
hath by you slipped through the nets that Kid wove
for him:rash hairbrained boy, what have you done,
by heaven, by your means we are destroyed, utterly
destroyed.
If thou believest, urged by a vexed and thwarted
spirit, returned Arnyte, firmly, that I, Peiter De
Lanoy
,
in lending my feeble aid to providence in the rescue
of Colonel Sloughter from those bloody and cruel men
in whose chains we both were suffering, have acted
wrong and unwiseI answer, that though foolish, I may
have done, ill, I have notfor if situated as we were,
there is a human being who would have taken another
course in existence, then let him declare it. It is well
my breast holds not a kindred with such, for an I thought
it did, I would tear this casement of flesh apart, anddrag
the foul secret forth, that it might meet the spurning tread
of all menthat the stony heart might wither in the dust,
nor disgrace the tenement that had held it.I am young,
and may to the cold statesman's ear talk wild; and in his
selfish calculations, that in which I have been an
instrument
of heaven's mercy, I may be deemed to have been
most indiscreet: be it somy own conscience doth
acquit
me of all evil; and yet I judge, that even on the
score of policy, the preservation of Colonel Sloughter's
life by me were not of such little moment, or of bad
augury,for can he that was saved from the assassin's
thirsty knife, by the son of Liesler detest or seek to
injure
,
although so tried by enemies, the parent of his
deliverer
.
Yet, be it as it will, let the worst comethe
dripping
axe of the headsman, and the bloody block of the
scaffold for us allwantonly I would not dip my hands in
human blood; for had I tamely stood by, having the
power to preserve, I were not better than the murderer
yet as it is, Sirs, hear me, though I know you may say
and think that I speak bold and forward for one so brief
of years, so young as I am,yet believe me, (and pardon
my warmth, for your words wound me deeply,) I have
the soul, though as you know, in other matters, a weak
and childish onestill in this, to bear all the malevolence
of fortune and wordly affliction, yea, very racks and
tortures
,
beyond life's endurance, rather than aid by my
forbearance
,
as ye do seem to have desired,a crime so
vile and rank, accursed by man and Godand this I speak
for truth. When Arnyte finished speaking, there was
a short pause.
To waste time thus, in a contention of words, helps
not; spoke out with petulent haste, one of the council.
What has happened cannot be now reversed;this we
know, that a person has landed and is among us, claiming
the authority of a ruler from the king. Its certainty is
not for us to dispute, I fear: therefore if we mean to
act, it doth straitway become us to prepare therefor
what is to be done ought to be proceeded on without delay.
I demand your opinions, sirs;what say ye should be
our course?
There was for awhile a deep and momentous silence,
each one awaiting, anxious and breathless, to hear what
would be said by the others, and fearful and hesitating to be
the first to break the doubtful and somewhat awful stillness
that reigned in the council, or become a leader in any
measure which the importance of the occasion demanded.
It were a study of the worldly nature of man to have
viewed
the countenances of that assemblage, whose feelings
were painted thereon, to the accurate observer, as strongly
as the reflective mirror exhibits the very self of the
person
who gazes into its smooth and glittering visage.
Here was the vacillating spirit, ready to change, and
quick to steer any course pointed out at the instant,
seeking
with inquiring eye, the face of some prudent leader,
whose tract its owner had been accustomed to follow:
and here were the deep brows drawn in contact, and the
hard and obstinate features set in unbending form, of
such as had determined their own course, let that come
which would; and who only refrained from breaking
forth at once, that they might be the more confirmed in
the right of their own minds, from the opposition of
others: and there were some, whose curled and scornful
lips, and sneering look, as they glanced at the disturbed
countenances around, bespoke their impatience of many,
and the malignity with which they viewed and were set to
receive, all that came from those to whom they felt
disaffected
;
and, lastly, among all these there were those
(and of these there were but few) upon whose calm
collected
fronts, like on a smooth pillar of marble, there
was no sign or mark to read that which passed within
these were such whom long career of days had robbed
of all outward appearance of passionwhom experience
had taught command of every index of their thoughts, and
who, cold and prudent, uninterested in all except
themselves
,
patiently awaited that which should come,
cautious
,
and without betrayal of their sentimentsit was,
in
truth, an interesting and agitated interval.
Will it please ye, Sirs, for me to deliver that which
I have thought to advise, at length said Samuel Edsell,
rising from his place slowly, after having waited
sometime
,
and resting his wrinkled band on the back of his
seat as if to support more firmly his aged and trembling
frame, and then looking on the faces of those about him
as if at once to read in their returning glances their assent
and accordance of sentiments to his own, and in a strong
tone, which, however, from the falling in of his lips, and
the loss of the teeth by age that had supported them, gave
to his words a peculiar and whispering enunciation, he
pursued: I have lived too long in this world, and seen
too much of its vanities and changes, as you may all well
know, to make up my mind and give that which I hold as
my opinion rashly and unreflected on, or for the sake of
hearing that which others may have to say, better that I
may quit the ground that I had takenhaving only
advanced
my word that I might snap at another'sbut let
that pass; that the advance which I shall make may not
suit either the temper of some or even the judgment of all
here present, I am somewhat awareI may be wrong,
for we are all liable to errors, yet it is natural, though it
may be ill of me to say so, that one who hath experienced
something, and hath much at stake, honour, fortune, and
family, should be less prone to advise or be ready to lead
an evil way than such as are foreign in birth and but
blustering
adventurers among us, who have nothing but their
blood to part with, which were not worth the draining
nay, interrupt me not;
no
person here can be harmed by
my remarks: all know I mean no disrespect to any
honourable
member who hath a place with usnay, I will
say it was but a passing observationwell, no matter, let
it go for nought, my intention was to show how much I
held the interest of the province at heartand that were
needless for me to repeat here, where those who are my
friends are assembled. In this province have I lived
since birth; I am a yeoman of Queen's county, and so was
my father before mehe was one of the first settlers, and
his bones are laid there, God assoilzie him, and I hope
that this withered body of mine may rot in this my native
land, without a curse from my posterity; leaving them an
honest name, such as my ancestors have left to me
beshrew
me, ye may well suppose I wish not to court
disgrace
albeit,
8*
I am not envious of a traitor's title, nor has
this neck of mine supported this head, scanty of locks and
bald as it is, mayhap worthless in more youthful eyes,
for the executioner's mark to whet his skill by severing
it from the parent body, as is the fate of rebels to their
liege sovereign, and opposers to his willno, let
disobedient
servants suffer such deserved penalties; but for us,
Sirs, of this Council, be a different pursuit:at once let
the gates of this place be opened, and in a body let us go
forth and meet the favoured subject of King William,
Colonel
Henry Sloughter, Governor of the province of New
Yorke, and for the furtherance of this desired object, I hope
that measures for his honourable reception will be taken,
and that immediately Jacob Leisler, as in duty bound,
prepare
to vacate the station which he hath so faithfully held in
trust for this expected moment, and for which he deserves,
for the excellent discharge of duties assigned him
heretofore
,
the united thanks of the whole colony; and that the
course is simple, a deputation from among us set out to
deliver our tender congratulations to his excellency, and
learn his wishes concerning our offices. Edsell resumed
his seat, while something like applause and approval
went through the Council, but which, although a sign of
the feelings of many, was somewhat repressed by
expectancy
of what might be further said.
Methinks I have heard aright, and yet natheless, I
count not on threescore years, cried Milbourne, starting
abruptly on his feet, nearly as soon as his opponent had
concluded, while, as he spoke, his eye flashed like fire,
his lip grew white and trembling with the fierce emotions
of his disturbed breast, which, as he strove to restrain
from bursting forth in their fury, affected his utterance.
At first, a sneering, spiteful smile, if so it could be termed,
sat on his flushed visage, and his voice and words were
in accordance; but as he proceeded, his rage seemed to
overleap the bounds of its confinement, and his tones
grew harsh, thick, and in the end, almost unintelligible;
Yes! yes! thank God I have not the hypocrisy of age
to plead with! I have not grey locks to call in witness
nor can I prate of coolness or experience on the score of
years; but this I can do, and for it I have lived in this
world long enough, I can, at a glance, see through the
borrowed mask of disinterestedness, with which vile,
black-hearted men seek to cover their traitorous and
selfish
designs. I am youngnay, not so young neither, but
what I can detect a specious villain, and know when the
winter-frozen adder feels the heat, that he is the first to
sting the foolish peasant who hath nursed himyea, the
breast that hath warmed his iced frame will he destroy.
I am frank; I do not cloak my words when I mean them
I wish to be understood; I do not say one thing with
my heart and deny it with my lips, as some do; for I
repeat
,
I can descry, even let his vizard be of iron, the
hoary ruffian, who, to save his own blood and shield his
worthless body from hurt, would sacrificebetray, as
though they were but cattle to be slaughtered for his
pleasure
,
the lives of all that were in his keeping. Do you
understand me, Samuel Edsell?
For heaven's sake, be calmthis will not do,
interrupted
several; be calmrestrain this personal
invective
.
This interference, however, was in vain; the anger of
the speaker was raised, and the abortive attempts to
allay
and smother his voice, seemed rather to increase its
furyfor shaking off from his sleeve the hands that had
officiously been stretched forth to pull him in his seat, like
the baited bull stung and goaded to very madness by the
repeated attacks of the dauntless blood hounds, his efforts
to be heard strengthened with the busy hum of words
that the members of the council endeavoured to drown
it in, and became like a peal of thunder above the storm,
clear, loud, distinct, and almost uninterrupted by his own
exhaustion of breath.
By the eternal heaven! he shouted, with brows set
in deadly wrath, and striking his hand upon the table
before
him so that it rang with the violence of the blow,
who bids me be calm? who will dare still me when I
wish to be heard? By hell! have I not been insulted,
and ought I not to avenge it? insulted, grossly insulted!
a child would not bear it; and by an old and deceitful
villain
who thirsts to deceive uswho hungers after the
favour
of the new hauble that the king hath set up for us
to worshipwho already hath put out his lean and
grasping
hand for the crumbs of this fresh tyrant that hath
been sent to suck the marrow of this land and to oppress
us, who cares not so he is enriched, if we, the people,
starve;and doth not this old villain, who here would
seem all virtue, speak of our tame submission to this cast
off debauchee of court favourthis parasite, who unfit for
aught but the purlieus of a palace, hath been deputed to
trample on the settlers of the forest. And even this were
nought to hear but to laugh at, had he not, I mean the
spy who sits among us, yon aged whiner, set his mark
upon me, branding my fair name as a foreign adventurer,
blustering and passionate, without honour, fortune or
family to lose or care for, a very bravo whose blood was
to be sold to any that sought it. Now let him hear me
though not born on this soil, yet from adoption, from
marriage it is mine, and more than he will do, I am ready
to die for it;then as to my name, there is no blemish on
my coat, let him show it an he can:but as to him, but
scan his crimped, thievish visage, disgusting with age
that which in youth must have been ill, are they not the
very features of some jesuitical priest of Alsatia, some
cut throat bloated pimp, who seeketh safe neck from the
hangman in the windings of that city of refugeand do I
judge from nature? his boasted ancestor should have
been some done over knave, who took this country for
his dwelling in preference to an airing on the Tyburn
tree; and his descendant is the very mirror of himself,
long since worthy of the knightly collar of hemp that is
hatcheld at Newgate. What doth he say, upon no
assurance
but the advisers, go forth and meet and give
ourselves
into this Sloughter's hands! What! like whipped
curs, lick the leash that cuts uscast the weapons of
safety from our hands, and await the fiat of a foe! No!
let such tame, coward spirits as his do that; go, let him
grovel in his native kennel, and kiss the boot heels of
powerbut for us, let us show ourselves men of pith and
nerve, and act the deeds of men.
As Milbourne sat down there was a whispering in the
apartment, and the stern looks of some betokened the
taking of some momentous resolution, and many scarce
drew their breaths, in eager anxiety of that which would
followthe dark and angry glances of others, and their
burning cheeks, bespoke that had ought yet attached
them to their companions, that the bonds of friendship
were broken in twain for ever; the breach had been
widened
beyond all reconciliation, and it was plain there
now wanted but the bold hand to make the first
movement
and unsheath the sharpened steel, for all to take the
dagger from their belts, and quench the insults received,
and the bitter hatred of their respective leaders, in the
heart's blood of their former co-mates. Indeed, there
were those who marked out, should such signal be given,
their adversary with their eye, measuring his strength
with their envious gaze, and the place even on their
bodies
where advantageously the most fatal blow could be
given.
In this stress Leisler endeavoured to interpose.
With sorrowful accent he bewailed the untimely
difference
that had been made, and laboured by every means
he was master of, to recall the ancient league that had
existed between all present; and strove, but in vain, to
sooth to calm, the unruly tempest of their heated breasts.
Many appeared scarce to hear himothers seemed to
hearken to that which he said, but with unbending
countenances
and in gloomy silence; his words fell like a
momentary
rain on the parched bosom of a sunburnt and
sandy regionsinking and drying away even as it touched
the burning earth, but giving no refreshment. And as
he finished speaking, Edsell rudely pushed from him his
seat and stood up, as did all who were attached to him.
I have borne much, and that I have so borne such
base contumely, doth even surprise me, quoth he, yet
I have borne it. Beshrew these aged limbs, twenty years
ago, ere the defamer could have spoken half his slander,
I had struck him dead, stone dead at my feet; but most
unwittingly time cools one's blood for instant actionso
he hath said, and it is true, or why stands he living to look
me in the face? and yet so it runneth within this brain of
mine, that scarce bearded boys were wont to have
reverence
for old men; but mayhap since my youth times are
alteredage keeps not pace with fashionsyet sooth had
I stood by, and saw a grey head treated as this of mine
hath beenGod! I had seized the villain by the throat
and choaked his life from out his venomous body. Yet
even as it is, these limbs are not so palsied, albeit the
years I have past through are weakeners of stouter ones
than I, yet I do think thou foul tongued knave, I can yet
chastise thee, and carve upon that coxcomb hide of thine
such work that thou shalt rue the hour thou didst awake
my wrath. But down, down old heart! it doth ill become
thee to swell thus at a mongrel's barking; no, I will not
lose my temper with thee, it befits not for thee to so
triumph. Let the boaster vaunt on his superior strength,
the gift of youth, and overawe such cowards as may
suppose
it bravery, an old man's arm will not disgrace him
no, I'll not measure swords with one whose courage,
judging from his conduct, consists of wordsaye, the
flight from Albany gives no light proof of warlike
qualities
;
but let that pass, and some other rumours with it
that have reached me, for I arose not to exchange scurrile
jests with thy vain relative, but to speak with you, Jacob
Leisler. It grieves me much, old friend, for thy sake,
and for our past affinity, that matters should so befall;
our many years of kindness ought not to be lightly rent
or forgotten. Yet so it is; together in this place longer
we cannot sit: there hath sprung up that between our
names that must for ever divide, like with an iron wall,
our courses of life; that must make the steps I take
adverse
to thine; yea blood cannot erase what hath passed
this night. Andnay, it is to ill purpose you would explain,
for as I am a breathing man, it is not in the power of the
living to blot from out the blistering calender of memory
the injuries that fret me; natheless, me and mine, and all
that think well of me, from this hour are strangers to
yoursalbeit, ere I leave you, for ancient fellowship, it
were but right in me to say as by caution, that an you
keep about your elbows cut-throat champions, to bully
those who are your truest well-wishers, it will not be long
ere you lack all but such a bravo's head for counsel, and
his murderous hand for defence. So having said, he
paused for a moment, and folding his arms, gazed sternly
in the countenance of Milbourne, who returned his proud
glance with a look of hatred as mortal and unrelenting as
that which he received, then turning from his enemy, he
waved his hand to his adherents and stalked with a
haughty stride, unshaken by his advanced years, to the
door of the apartment, followed by such as were of his
party, yet ere he departed he drew in his breath and
compressed his lips, to stifle the overflowing gall that
burthened
him as he cast back another and a last look of rage
and defiance; while all apparently expected, as it might
have been, were struck powerless with the movement he
had made, and none rose to intercept or oppose his
withdrawal
.
Milbourne was the first to break forth
There let him go, I say, cried he exultingly, well
rid are we of a traitor and a hypocrite.
Nien mien zon, said Leisler, dat is niet wel; dou
art haastig, heethoofdig, mien zon.
Thou art wrong, father, replied Milbourne, we
want him not; such as him we can well spare, and all
that have gone with him. He would within our counsel
have played the spy; he could have stung us to the
quick, but now he hath lost his power and his venom.
Yes, let him go and fawn for a smile about the path of
Sloughter; we are well rid of such dirt that but clogged
our wayyea, I wish Sloughter and Bayard all such
friends, who will not take long to ruin him, while we,
though few in numbers have the faithful and devoted
hearts that are now around us; so let him do his worst,
we can defy him. And now since these false hearted
partizans
have fled our ranks, and by their kind desertion
have left us free to act, unopposed by their vile efforts
to thwart our just designs, for the best interest of our
cause, how stands your minds, Sirs, that we return unto
the matters from which we have been so led by their
seditious
artifices, and lose not in urging the immediate
fulfilment
of the warrant that lies before us, which condemns
to immediate death the base convicts, Bayard and his
associate
.
Nay, my good friend, Milbourne, on this matter
permit
me to be heard, and be not ruffled at my opinion,
exclaimed De Lanoy, in a voice soothing and temporising:
yet I need not fear anger where even if I am deemed
misjudging, that my heart is steel to the cause we espouse
is truly known; and although than, even yourself, there is
no one here more thirsting on these criminals to inflict
the severities they have merited, natheless, taking time
and circumstance, which doth, from the pregnant danger,
demand more important considerationsfor be it as it may,
Edsell doth carry with him in his anger a vast power, his
native Queens, besides the other counties of the island
will at this, his disaffection, bow to the rising star, the
new comer;all this and that, it were policy for the
present
to spare life and watch the tide's flowing, doth the
more impress me that to act over hasty in this matter
were rash; very, very rash.
Now, by the blood of this right arm, interrupted
Milbourne warmly, my choler choaks me, to listen to a
man who boasts of sense parle thus timid and weak.
What, have you too caught the ditty's tune, that I
brow-beat
this councilthat I hector as I please within this
chamber? sooth, it is pleasant: ye propitiate my rage,
ere you say forth your honest sentiments:by heaven, I
wish not to smother the words of any manlet him have
his say, and yet, I think I too should be listened to, in
answer, when I believe it proper; for I am touched with
surprise, Peiter De Lanoy, to see you thus panic struck
thus pallid and aghast with affright!and for what?a
housewife's dreama nightmarea New-England witch's
prophecya baseless, shadowless creation of thy misled
minda harmless and threatening monster of thy heated
brain. 'Sdeath! Edsell will thin our party, say you: let
him take every sycophant like himselfI answer, we
are the better for it; and let this Sloughter gorge himself
with numbers.But look to the walls that protect us
here let him pause; thus far shall he go, but one step
farther shall be his destruction. We have the ammunition
and the iron tubes of death within this fortress, that shall
sweep in dust his hopes, however fed by the breaths of
lying traitors: yea, sooner than yield an atom of our
present power to this deputed knave, I, for one, would
have the walls that encircle us, the bulwarks that part us
from, and yet command the town below us, levelled to the
sea, and carnage and death wanton within this chamber's
self: albeit, adverse to me, there are some of other mind
to treat with this new ruler. If such are of the greater
number, sooth, I must give way; yet I would ask, what
have we to hope from him who hath been directed to
counsel with Nicholas Bayard? I cry your mercy, an
it be that you will bend the lowly knee and seek
forgetfulness
of the past, and, like tamed and subjected urchins,
with covered heads and sorrowful visages, follow your
master's train, content to bear his blows, his burthens
and his scorn; an there be such coward spirits, such abject
wretches, such paltry, grovelling souls among yeI am
silent; but death be my portion, as a man should die! I
take none of your council, but shall go forth alone and
dare the worst; and if I fall, shame be the lot,the
shame of dastards be with those, who, in the trying hour,
catered for their safety. Natheless, I yet mistake, ye are
true friends I misdoubt not, and will stand by the fate
of Leisler to the last; and if the worse should come, (I
repeat it,) an we should be driven to that dire needcessity,
we have the means of triumph with us, our slaves have
been ever ripe for plunder, revolt and massacre; but let
the hell hounds loose upon our foes, put the knife in their
hands, and wave the torch for havoc,and, as I live, we
shall kindle a funeral pyre, that shall light this land from
the rolling ocean to the howling wilderness, and shall at
once consume within its bloody and burning bosom, even
with our own ashes, the hated names of our enemies.
Cuerpo de todas los santos, senores, caballeros, an
you carry on your bonaventure such heavy sheets,
damme, I should think your mizzen would be after dipping
salt water, broke in sudden and abruptly a strange
voice while the speaker, with a bold and confident air,
trode into the very centre of the apartment.
Vol. II. 9
The whole council rose in surprise, and some even in
alarm, at this unexpected and unlooked for intrusion.
The hands of several grasped instinctively their
weapons
;
and their uneasiness was by no means quieted by
the manner and appearance of the personage who had so
boldly and uninvited thrust himself upon their
deliberation
.
Who,what are you, that hast thus dared
insolently to come among us, exclaimed several, their
voices raised loud and threatening with anger.
We are betrayed, treason hath glided in unseen upon
us, cried others, at once in tones of wonder and alarm.
Are there none sentry at the doorbut are our
counsels in the open street, sternly inquired others.
What seek ye, rash regardless man, that within our
secret conclave unbidden you have made thus free,
thundered Milbourne, advancing with furious gesture as
he spoke, with sword bared upon the intruder, come
you as friend, or are you hostile to our plans? what hast
thou heard, base eavesdropper? how long within the
echo of our words have you stood unmarked? by what
sorcerers art hast guiled our watchful guard?deliver
master the very truth, if from the reach of this sharp
steel untouched you would escape.
Straight tell the tale, albeit art an enemya spy upon
this council; an so may the curse of Cromwell blast thee,
dogthou hast seen thy last; an I say thou hast not a clear
account, thy blood is sold unto the drinking of our
swords, shouted De Lanoy, and in a moment the
glittering
and deadly points of a score of blades, were thrust
within an inch of the defenceless breast of the daring
offender
:
he, however, recoiled not a whit before the
direful
array that met his further advance.
Por el amor de dios, poco a poco, speak me fair and
softly senores; carja! be ye wanting me to palaver, see
ye drop your bristles and let me have sea room, quoth
the stranger, folding his arms cool and unconcerned, and
gazing undaunted in look and unmoved in posture on the
fierce preparation about him; d'ye see, I take this as
queer greeting to a caballerofor curse me but I am of
good breeding. Yvenger quiniento soeldas, as the
hidalgo
says on the Main, so its damned rough in you to go this
quartering when a messmate moors water shot in your
harbourand as for boarding you without letting you
know, how the devil should I when there is not a man
above decks from poop to windlass, and the hatches
amidship are all open.
Nay, parley not a word with the vile ruffian, but
beat the craven slave to earth with your stout steels,
exclaimed
Arnyte Leisler, with eyes flashing and gesture
rapid with animation, as he rushed from his father's side,
where a breathless and silent spectator he had remained
of all that had heretofore passed, the varied emotions of
his mind vividly marked on his expressive countenance,
alternate pale with fear, then flushed with hopeand
now his breast heaved and his limbs trembled as it were,
with indignant rage, at the sight of an old and oppressive
foewhy hold you back, good friends, know you not the
murderous marauder? it is the bloodiest and most cruel
of Kid's savage crewdrag down the vile buccaneer.
Voto a dios! are you there, master, returned
Eumet
,
for it was he, and found thy tongue, prate a-pace
valgame dios! thou hast steered a pretty course,
youngster
,
a fine mess hast thou made of itcurse me if thou
dost not deserve marooning worse than ever poor devil
that has been left on the Keys in my days.
What then, thou comest from Kid? said De Lanoy,
what says the treacherous rover? and what meanest
thou that no one hast stopped thy advance within the
gates of this fortress?
A fe Cabellero, I spin no tough yarns d'ysee replied
the rover boldly, El capitan del barco hath put out his best
hawser to help you, but damn it, it wont do, the ship heaves
in too strong a current for to hold; thof, had it not been for
the fingers of yon meddlesome urchin, madre santa de
dios! but ere this watch you had been ridden of all we
had to count for fear, le misericordia asia dry voyage
hath no helpso dy'see I have just by the old man's
orders
steered hitherward, to let you know the sharks are
playing about your timbers already, carja, this new
governor
has run up his bunting at the old Stadt-huis, and is,
as fast as the glass drops, out swelling the number of his
followers, as the thinning of your own crew shows.
We are lost, there is no help for us, interrupted one
of the council, in accents of despair. I wonder not, now
this fellow came on us without obstacles, our very guard
hath joined the general desertion, and fled with the
traitorous
Edsell.
By heaven he speaks truth, exclaimed several others
rushing in the apartment tumultuously and alarmed, after
having been forth and examined the certainty of their
situation, alas for ustreachery hath prevailed, our
gates stand ajar, desertedour cannon hath had foul play,
and lay dismounted by their carriages, while here and
there, alone of all that heretofore espoused our party,
wanders
a solitary friend, amid the desolation of our cause.
I fear me this man hath brought us no false news,
quoth another, rushing in with terror depicted on his
pallid countenance, for as I went forth, and stood upon
the rampart that overlooks the town, a deep and busy
hum broke on mine ear in the distance, and light after
light shot and flared through the darkness, as of a
gathering
multitude, along the rondels and about the bazaar,
and methought, my eyes so read it in the night, there was
something hoisted on the Stadt huis, that moved, curled,
floated, and seemed like a flag.
We are undone, we are undone, save yourselves, save
yourselves, there is no help for uscried one rushing
wildly into the very centre of the chamber. He had gone
forth the first, and had stayed the longest, and now
returned
with irresolute step, haggard countenance, and
almost
breathless; all with pale and anxious visages
gathered
about him.
For mercy sake, how is it, let us hear the worst,
inquired
the terrified council.
We are ruined, we shall be destroyed we are utterly
ruined, replied the person questioned, after a moment's
pause of gloomy expectation, I have found the evil all
confirmed, a rage, a wild rage, hath seized the people,
all rush to follow the wake of this new governor, our
hired soldiery fly the barracks, no orders, no authority
withholds them, and the new tyrant already wantons in
his conquest; surrounded and advised by the Bayard
party, he swears our destruction, unless instantly we
surrender
to his power at discretion; and supplied by means
of the false Edsell, with artillery from the rondels, if
we submit not he prepares to fire upon our defenceless
walls.
Well let him nor croak thy unhallowed dirge,
messenger
of ill, as if it were our death song; silence, raven, silence,
nor with thy black omened tidings, make women of
garbed
men, said Milbourne sternly,
a deep frown darkening
his lowered brow, how say you now, what bring you of
our foeman, that thus your cheeks should blanch to the
livid coloring of the grave, and your limbs palsy, as
stricken
in the winter of age;sdeath let us hear no more of
these wind gathered rumours, or bear them like sea rocks
do tempests, for what rain drops fall from these dark
clouds, but such as men might shake from off their
mantles
,
nor feel the heavier for the wet;yet even so it is,
when the yellow leaf sears and drops the tree is but worth
the firing; yea, men crowd in its summer foliage, and rest
in its shade, as though they dwelt in the circle of a
fostering
spirit, and now the storm is up, and strips us
barkless
,
and barethe coward sycophants fly our vicinity, as
one would a pestilence, nor gaze back, but to direct home
the axe's blow to our roots!ah well! ah well! that my
stout heart should fail:And you old man, my sire by
marriage
,
continued he addressing Leisler, how like you this
the falling off of these cursed dogs, that have fed from out
your trenchers, that have lived upon your bread and wine;
that but a brief past of time, you would have deemed
you had but to have bid them pour forth the filthy current
of their veins, at your command, and their blood had
flowed as water;no matter,I could wish the period back
that, but what would it help, the world hath been ever
the same,and yet old man, in me you shall not be
deceived
.
At times I may have been a rough friend, and done
thee
harm, by my quick spirit, yet I am ready to expiate
such crimes, for well I know there is no help for us once
in the Bayard's powerfather the block be mine, that
holds that hoary headto the last, even death, will I be
with thee Jacob Leisler.
9
Mien son Yaakoop, ik dinks niet, but zo as dou ish,
replied Leisler, taking him affectionately by the hand,
sdill ik hoops vor besser dimes, dings are niet zo
kwaade.
Alas, believe it not, answered Milbourne, I did
indeed
think that about us, there were some few who would
dare cling to us in adversity, who would an it should have
so came to swords, with their bodies, have taught this
proud stranger, who is now to rule this province, that the
wild settlers of America, were of as bold a mettle, as ever
fluttering courtier of Whitehall; but such thought is over,
who can gaze upon these faces about us, whitened with
lily livered fear, and think there is ought left for us, but
to kiss this Sloughter's feet.
Voto a dios! I swear by the bread and the wine,
exclaimed Eumet, they have much belied thee, Captain'
Milbourne. There have been those who told that you
were a spark that made more smoke than fire; but damn
them, d'ye see they foully lied: he viajdo por tierra, y
por mar, as they say on the main,  la Espagnola, and I
have never seen the man whose colours I would sooner
sail under than yours, Captain Milbourne; and curse me,
thof these here are thrifty of their lives, d'ye see here's
the boy that'll stand by you against wind and tide as long
as a plank sticks together, or there is a steel cutlass to
be handled. Carja! a rover's word is cutter's law, and
may I be keel hauled an I break faith with thee.
Before Milbourne could return an answer to this
voluntary
tribute and offer of services from the pirate, he
was interrupted by the long, shrill blast of a trumpet,
whose warlike note was heard to sound loudly without.
It was a summons from the new governor, that those
who held the fort should straitways come forth and
deliver
it up peaceably to his possession; otherwise they
should be held as traitors to the king, and when taken
should suffer the punishment of death by the laws
decreed
to rebels who dispute the authority of their liege
lord and sovereign.
What course shall we pursue? said one of the
council hesitatingly, after having heard the threatening
message. Had we not best submit at once, nor give
by our obstinacy in a vain defence, cause for our utter
destruction?
With the few that is left with us it were idle to
suppose
we could long hold out, quoth another, and yet
we should notnay, it becomes us not to surrender at
discretion. Yet in this stress, whatever is best for the
common weal, doubtless should be followed by all
without
a murmur.
Ay, ay, cut and carve your paths even as ye list
think but for yourselves, exclaimed Milbourne in a bitter
tone, if ye can ride the waves in safety care not who is
wrecked; what boots a loss of time when it is already
determined
?
go at once, and open the gates, and sue at
this courtier's feet for pardon; go, I say, nor pause to
think you have abandoned some to death.
Nay, Captain Milbourne, responded De Lanoy, I
must say that it doth appear to me that often, although
it may be from honest zeal, you are too hasty, and many
times interpret intentions and words fallen from your
friends, both wrong and strangely. I will vouch there
are but few here deserve the evil you would believe of
usnor is there one who would cater basely for his own
life, while our good leader Jacob Leisler and our
associates
are at stake. No, I will say there is not one who
would save his own blood by selling that of another's.
Yet it must be confessed that our situation is dangerous
at least, if not desperate. What have we to count on in
a rash defence of this fort? we have not the means nor
the provision to hold out longand by doing so we would
but increase the inveteracy of our enemies, and give,
perhaps, to this new governor, a just cause for
persecution
,
as well as a pretext for using against us the direst
means of punishment, when at last we should be
compelled
to yield to his power. Now thus, on calm and
deliberate
survey of the matter, would I advise:that
certain
of us go to the quarters of Colonel Sloughter, since
he has formally called us to admit his authorityit will
be politic methinks so to act, and thereby under cover of
treating with him and learning that which it were well
we now should pretend to doubt, the truth of his
pretensions
and commissionwe may be enabled to creep into
his designs, at least so far as respects his intentions
towards
us. Now we may have much mistaken him as for
evil; but an it turn out so, let our foes bewarethis fort
may yet prove a bane to them; the tiger at bay in his
covert yields not with life, nor till, in his mad and
desperate
struggles, he dies the jungle deeply with the best
blood of his pursuers.
De Lanoy speaks well, at this juncture a better plan
we cannot adopt, said one of the council, let it be
agreed that he and Milbourne forthwith proceed upon
the matter.
It is determined, said De Lanoy, as a unanimous
assent
to the measure was expressed, and hear, to
quicken
our departure, there hath come from this eager
courtier
a second messenger.
And as he spoke, another blast of the trumpet, with
its harsh and hollow notes, rung on the outer drawbridge,
and with its loud and fearful voice, seemed to make the
very walls around tremble with the stern echo. Several
went forth to receive the messenger, and parley with him
from the gateway.
I like not greatly this your resolve my masters, quoth
Milbourne, doubt me but it seems unwise, and at once
puts us in this Sloughter's hands, but you have willed it,
albeit it appears in good faith for our common cause,
and Ian you desire my service, will not be the one to
shrink from the part assigned me, natheless though it be
that of danger, for it glads me to see that you have
plucked
spirit in distress, you have robbed the nettle of its
sting, for he that boldly looks in the grim and iron front
of danger, grows accustomed to its frowns, and thinks
little
of it. So friend De Lanoy, at once let us on our
mission
;
be firm of soul, good comates till our return, and an I
mistake not, we shall bring ye news of this Sloughter,
that will make you think less of the lion's roar then
turning
to Eumet he added be at hand, brave master, there
may be need of thy stout arm, to carve a passage for our
return, and a light heart like thine, I know betokens a
bold hand.
They departed on their adventure, while from the
period
they quitted the apartment, the members of the
council appeared disturbed, and agitated with expectant
suspense; some with hasty steps silent and in anxious
thought paced the boundaries of the chamber, which
seemed narrow to their eager flight of mind. Others
gathered in groups and whispering their fears, were
startled
by every blast of wind that swept around the building
that held them. Some gazed forth with strained eyes,
through the small window panes in the dark night, and
strove to descry aught that might stir in the city below,
while others cast themselves upon the long settles by the
door, that they might be ready to receive the first rumour
of the event of the embassy, and avail themselves of any
favorable opportunity at the outset; not one was
unmoved
,
but all partook alike, of the deep and fearful interest
of the moment. And now more than at any period of
the scene, habitual ceremony and respect appeared
disregarded, for Leisler untended, except by the careful
solicitude of Arnyte, remained in his place, solitary and
deserted, a prey to the anguish that racked his mind as
he reflected on the dire straits of his fallen fortunes
meanwhile, the savage protector of his son stood mutely
by, leaning on his gun and looking anxiously in the grief
expressive countenances of the hapless parent and his
child, as though he would fain participate in the sorrow
that rent their breasts. Slow flew the laggard time;
hour after hour heavily wore away, and yet there came
no news from those that had gone forth. There is no
time so wearisome as that wherein the mind is tortured
to learn the event of any thing that deeply concerns the
personal safety; suspense is terriblea serpent who
hangs to the heart strings with thirsty tongue, and
momently
draws bloodthe rack whereon the criminal is
impaled, tears not the body to agony, as its sufferance;
naturally as it protracts, gloom and shadow darken the
imagination, and busy thought had painted in the minds
of Leisler and his adherents; long ere it had happened,
the misfortunes that had befallen their legates, and which
the reader will find detailed in the next section.
SECTION III.
Abus.
Some envious devil has ruined us yet more;
The fort's revolted to the Emperor;
The gates are opened, the portcullis drawn;
And deluges of armies, from the town
Come pouring in:
Dryden's Aurengzebe
.
With a step doubtful, and as though distrusting the
purpose
for which it was used, a mind undetermined and a
heart that beat heavily with a painful foreboding of
anticipated
misfortune, Milbourne accompanied by his
associate
,
De Lanoy, and followed closely by the daring
freebooter
,
who had enlisted himself in his service, proceeded
on the errand, rather for reconnoitre than for the sake of
forming a treaty for amicable adjustment, which, in the
state of the Leisler faction, was so adviseable. Slowly
they descended to the outlet of the fort, which was now
indeed the last hold of their party's power, whose vaunted
strength in danger had seemed to crumble to dust like an
exposed corse from the touch, when disinterred after long
resting in the solitude of the graveindeed their glory
had been brief; it was now fast expiring, like the quick
and brilliant flash of a dying light. As they went along,
the two leaders for awhile spoke not a word in converse
with each other; for now the excitement which had
stirred
the spirit in the council unsupported by the presence
of others, and the momentary cause which had enkindled
the fierce temper of the one and called forth all the
calmness
of deliberation in the other, had passed away like
the smoke of a funeral pyre when they quitted the
chamber
wherein their comrades had assembled; and disturbed
with like feelings of distress at the disasters which
evidently
thickened around them, they instinctively for a
while, both hesitating to break silence, avoided discourse,
but each strode on his way, wrapt in his own deep
meditation
.
The night wind blew thrilling, sharp, and cold,
and the crusted snow and crisped ice, worn by the
passage
of the past day, crackled beneath their tread, and
yet the vast heaven, strown as it were with hosts of living
drops of silver, looked calm and beautiful, while the
moon, glittering with radiant lustre, walked the broad
sky and smiled on the earth, whose whitened bosom,
glowing in the light, gleamed like innumerable spangles
on the robes of beauty; all around was visible, and the
long line of parapets cast their deep shadows like frowns
upon the snow clad ground; the path of Milbourne and
his associates was uninterrupted, except when hailed by
the eager and troublesome questions and inquiry of the
sleepless and despairing partizan who now and then met
them, and who strove to catch from their brief replies the
least spark of hope; yet as he pursued his way, the quick
eye of Milbourne marked the solitary and deserted state
of the garrison: shorn of half the former numbers that
had composed it, and with those left all was disorder and
confusion; where centinels should have been, their post
was deserted, and the men were gathered in groups
distant
from their duty, and there were dark whispers with
some, while the countenances of many in the moonlight
looked pallid and aghast as palsied with terror, and the
brows of others wore gloomy discontent, the murmurs of
which often broke forth unrestrained like the muttering
growls of some angered beast of prey, as hungered and
disappointed of food he retraces his track to his
darksome
denthe heavens, it is true, wore the sweet look
of peace; yet the mind of man as it is ever in this weary
life of ours, was wrathful and tempestuous and swelling
with bleak storms; indeed, as Milbourne gazed about him
and beheld the truth of what had been announced to his
disheartened comrades in the Council, the too palpable
desertion of Leisler's former strongest, and as supposed,
most faithful retainers, and the apparent neglect of every
appearance of preparation to oppose the stern approach
of Sloughter, which ought to have been now momently
expected, and his hostile guise met with suitable
reception
,
he felt his spirit sink lower within him dampened at
the sight, and the thought struck heavy to his heart that
neither the forlorn state nor danger to which they were
now reduced had been magnified, and yet even more than
all, there cut deep unto the core that all had been
brought on by those who had been most trusted, who had
been most counted friends; ingratitude had thinned the
ranks that should have circled round and made a wall
through which no power of man could break; yet so it was,
even like the flower that adorns the bush in summer-tide
and sucks its strength for life; at the first touch of winter,
it yellows and drops away, leaving that stalk which had
delighted
in its beauty naked and defenceless, to be swept
away by the wind; and yet nature parts these, the flower
and its supporter, while here no cause existed for
desertion
except the baseness of men's hearts; and the haughty
and fiery soul of Milbourne as he thus reflected felt that
could he but have an hour's revenge upon the traitors
who had thus quitted and sold the cause of their patron
for their selfish interest, he would quaff without repining
the bitterest poison of his fate, even to its last dregs
though when the drawbridge rose behind him, and the
chains of the portcullis rattled as they dropt down the
weight they had lifted up, while he and his associates
passed under, and when he stood beyond the moat and saw
nothing above the bastions but the high steep roofs of the
kerck, the gevangen huis and the governor's residence, a
fear arose within him that he had done rash to depart on an
errand to the foe, leaving dissatisfaction and almost terror
with those who still remained, and exposing his own safety
at the mercy of a man to whose faith he was a stranger, and
who as of course was infuriated by the show of resistance
that had been returned to his summons to yield; and how
such was likely to receive him and his companions,
questioning his authority, even at the moment they came
to treat with him, he was ignorant; albeit, he was not
at ease concerning the manner they might be treated by
one haughty and confident in success, and doubtless
irritated
by as yet an almost unbending opposition, even were
this man one, contrary to the usual nature of mankind, of
otherwise mild and forgiving disposition; and a hope, a
lingering
hope like a plank that the drowning mariner strives
to catch at, even though floating far beyond his graspin
spite of all depicted by the stern reality that, had stared him
in the face, would grow on his mind and cling to his heart
loth to quit him, that had he not left the walls of the fort,
his activity might, in the despairing souls around him,
have sown his own unquenchable fire, and the drooping
spirit of the remaining partisans might have still been
raised; and so strong at times did this deceiving feeling
come upon him, that he was nearly tempted to retrace
his steps, nor sue for one atom of kindness from the new
governor, nor descend to the meanness of searching for
his plans against them until the ordnance of the fort gave
out its last breath of death, and the ramparts could no
longer be made good for want of a man to defend them.
God's wo on Egypt light heavily upon the white
hearted
and unmanly knaves, quoth he involuntarily, as the
darkest side of the picture of a sudden obtruded its gloomy
yet true and faithful images upon his mind, and for a time
suppressed all trust and dependance on more pleasing
forms: There is nought in them, not a child's courage;
the sick man's ague hath chilled them, frozen them
powerless
.
'Sblood! I had as soon make good a breach with
a herd of deer as trust them; aye it were better, for a hart
at bay oft gives fatal wounds to the hunter, while these war
accoutred girls tremble too much to raise a hand gun
and yet with half the number of those we muster behind yon
gallant breastwork, think you not De Lanoy, were they but
men resolved to stand to the worst, though their blood
ran for it, this servile journey of ours had not been spared?
God! it frets me sorely; ere I could crouch to take
this Sloughter's hand and cry in his train, methinks my
flesh should kiss his dagger.
Sooth Captain Milbourne replied his comate, my
thought and resolution is akin to yours, for I feel it were
a degradation to give way one atom, to this
commissioned
tool of Bayard, and Van Kortlandt; I go to him with
as little wish for favor at such hated hands, as even you,
and had there been bold hearts and determined steels
behind
Vol. II. 10
us, by heaven with any living man, I had not stirred
a step upon such embassy as this, but when my voice
enforced
this counsel, you must be aware of my motives,
policy
dictated the course we now pursue, for indeed it was
plain, had this not been indulged our fear stricken
adherents
,
there had been nathless all reason an open rebellion,
and we who might oppose ere this had changed place with
Bayard and Nichols, in their condemned dungeons; but
as it is, we must bring them back so sore a tale as would
rouse them were they dead, and the shroud upon their
limbs,the harness of battle is not yet laid aside, the
cuirass
is on their breasts, and if I judge right of the nature
of men, they can be deluded to the frenzy of despair;
when there is no hope of safety for life or limb left them,
cowards become brave men; and mark me we can, an I
mistake
not, provoke this Sloughter to send with us a message
that though they be palsied to statues, shall make the
blood run flames within their veins; but take my advice
Milbourne, be not too hasty with this man, dive into him
first, read his heart if we can, he may not be so weak as
we have heard, to yield to Van Kortlandt's guidance, as he
were a senseless boat rowed by the oar; albeit as matters
are, let us use caution, and I build on this errand of ours,
as one from which much good to Leisler and our friends may
come, and if fortune in this time of need, stands at our
side, if not by force, at least by stratagem, we may
ensnare
this court parasite, in toils that he will find it
hard to break.
Nay, De Lanoy, believe me you are in error, returned
the other, no guile with all the diplomatic art of which you
are master will avail; the villain Edsell is with him,
and will watch our words as a lynx would his prey, ere this
the accursed greybeard, (I regret he tasted not my steel)
hath his ear; and think you not where the snake couches,
he drops no poison? Therefore I disagree with your
advice
let
our course I say be bold; even if with our swords
we hew a retreat, it will serve us better, as you have well
devised, to inflame the dogs we leave in the shelter of
the fort,it will awaken in them that fear for themselves,
until which is aroused few men are stirred on; an we meet a
scurvy greeting I repeat, it will try to the last their
mettle
,
and if they change not, poltroons as they are, they
shall survive to see us die, and learn that a brave man's
death, is a coward's shame. But hold, I am too loud? here
are some who I should be unwilling to have heard our
converse.
At the end of the causeway, which from the western gate
led down the hill, whose top the fort crowned, was a long
clear space, or rather plain of ground, smooth and level, and
though now one desolate sheet of snow, sullied in whiteness
by numerous crossed and trampled pathways to and from
the fort and streets that opened on it, yet it was often the
scene of hilarity and pleasure in summer days, for here
the burghers held an annual cattle fair, and sometimes a
market; and the choicest products of Staaten Eylandt
and Mattouwacs on this place tempted the appetite, taste,
and purchase of the epicurewhose eagerness had at
least one good effect, that of rewarding the industrious
yeoman. However, this piece of almost vacant ground
had more probably been left so that the fire of the fort
in a land attack might not interfere with the houses of the
city, rather than for the purpose of any agricultural
display
;
nevertheless, there had been so little danger from
this quarter, that most of the cannon on this side of the
fort had been removed, and about the centre of the
marktvelt
,
(for such was the name given to the open ground,)
a small building, or more properly a shed of rough-hewn
boards, had been raised mostly for the accommodation of
the burgomasters and other prominent dignitaries, who
came to see that order was kept among the quarrelsome
slaves, who were wont here to tend their masters' market
truck, and who, while all went on right, quietly and
comfortably
in the public service, smoked and dozed away
their time without fear of disturbance or interruption;
for the presence of great men alone is sufficient to awe
the vulgar in silence. The steps of Milbourne and
De Lanoy, during the brief interchange of words above
detailed, had wended so rapidly towards the
burgomasters'
place of respect and retirement, which stood
immediately
in their path, that Eumet had been left several
paces in their rear, either from his having been
accustomed
from his mode of life to a slower pace on land,
(for it is to be remarked in the manner of the mariner,
that his walk on shore appears as though he trod in an
element which was not congenial to his nature:) or from
a conscious feeling that the two leaders might have
communications
to make with each other on the subject of
their present pursuit, which they might not care to be
heard by a third person; and so, with a delicacy unusual
to one of his barefaced and insolent spirit, (but which
arose from his careless and reckless soul; for he thought
not who led the way, so there were blows to be met with
and plunder to be fought for:) the pirate's footsteps
lagged
behind his companions some considerable distance,
yet within a moment's call and sight.
Santa Trinidada, thou hast rode the peak truly, said
the marauder, in somewhat of a repentant humour to
himself, as he thought on the little likelihood of profit in
his new employ; carra, thy soul has run away with thy
reasonthou hast taken up with poor wagecurse me,
but banyan days will increase an I make such cruises
where there seems more likelihood of blows than
marvedis
despacio!
I had forgot the proverb, `Habla poco y
piensa bien;' but hang care, I am in for it, and blast me if
I take to the long boat, thof the ship's sinking.
At this period he was suddenly aroused from his
reverie
by beholding Milbourne and De Lanoy abruptly pause
in their progress; and he lost not a minute, ere he was at
their side: for as the former spoke the exclamation of
caution, which has been narrated, they had unconsciously
drawn within a pace or two of the shed above described,
from under the concealment of which started several
figures, whose long shadows as they rose in the moonlight,
discovered them in time for Milbourne and his companion
to start at their approach, and to keep off with their
swords, for an instant's parley, the barrels of the levelled
arquebuses of the city patrouille, for such they were who
now barred the further procedure of the legates of the
Leislerian faction. The group consisted of about twenty
persons, whose singularity, not to say somewhat ludicrous,
disagreement of dress and accoutrements, in some
measure
,
bespoke them honest and placable burghers,
somewhat
emulous of military fame, and who, driven by the
fervour of patriotism, for awhile had laid down their
peaceable callings and in the alarm of the times, had
metamorphosed
themselves into the stern followers of war.
As might be expected from their haste of preparation,
which was commensurate with their zeal, they sat but
small store on equality of size or figure and similarity of
attire in their enrolment; and there seemed also little
preference in the manner of their death-weapons, the
choice being evidently that of the readiest; for one wore
a massive and heavy breastplate of iron, and bore in his
hand a rusty partisan, which doubtless he inherited as the
armour of his ancestors, who, from the age and looks of
the warlike appurtenance, were in all probability
servitors
of the `priviledged Wes-India companie,' under the
rule of Christianse and Eelkees:another had girded to
his side a ponderous broadsword, and although proud in
bearing so tried and deadly a steel, yet being short from
the trunk to the heel, (which is vulgarly called duck
legged
,)
this son of Mars evidently had more trouble in
the disagreeable rencontres, which, on account of his
briefness
of figure and the sword's length, ensued every now
and then between the weapon and his ankles, than possibly
his enemies might have received from its sharpness and his
dexterity of using it: however, as supporters to these
important
personages, one or two there were of the patrouille,
lusty and strongly limbed, the flower of the youth of the
Nieuw Nederlandts, proud of going to war, decorated with
the favours of Dutch lovemighty bunches of ribbons at
the knee, and defended by immense buttons on their jerkins,
whose solidity and circumference were almost shields in
miniature
;
and they were well supplied with fire arms, the
contents of which they were reckless how eager they
were discharged as the death warrants of a foe.
Stand for your lives, and tell who and what ye are,
exclaimed several of the patrouille at one voice.
Speakare you for the rebel Leisler, or the king?
echoed others, their words bursting from their lips in a
shout at nearly the same breath, each one appearing the
most desirous to be attended to and heard, so that their
speech was almost a confused and tumultuous jargon.
10*
Hold back thy officious arm, cried De Lanoy,
drawing
down the savage Eumet's upraised hand, which
threatened
to fall heavy on the head of one of the stout
burghers
of the patrouille and cool the ardour of his gallantry
for ever, and at the same time withholding the buccaneer
from rushing on the other opposers of their progress, and
dealing the destruction his vengeful eyes threatened;
for no sooner had he beheld the pointed weapons that had
stopped the way, ere, like the trained bloodhound when
in sight of the chace, he thirsted for the death, and was
ready for the onset. And you, fellow-burghers of
Nieuw Oranje, continued De Lanoy, seek not our
lives so hastily with adverse hands, for we have
trespassed
on your guard not with the deadly guise of foemen,
but, albeit, an there bide among ye not those who by rash
and selfish bearing contemn our offeringswe come with
the budding branches of the olive; yea, we have now
sought ye as men desirous of settling all difference, and of
giving peace to the aching wounds of this distracted
province
.
For this purpose, Captain Milbourne and myself,
(your ancient townsman, Peiter De Lanoy,) with this our
faithful follower, request safe conduct from you, my
masters, to the presence of him who is said to hold the
king's commission as our new appointed ruler;I mean
the person men term Colonel Henry Sloughter.
Gad's mercy, and is it you, Meinheer Peiter De
Lanoy
?
blood o' me! which I deem a fierce and becoming
oath, and savours a warrior's lip, quoth in reply a voice
at once slender and squeaking, and which was produced
by the delicate organ of the throat of a lean, thin,
shrivelled
little personage, whose pallid visage looked sallow
and healthless in the moonlight; which alike shone on
attire at once conceitedly and daintily disposed upon the
wearer:so that with gorgeous profuseness of garment
and consequential demeanour, he laboured with the air of
one who supposed himself of the utmost importance in
the patrouille, and thereon verily swelled with martial
dignity, right gladsome am I, as an I were ordered to
trim a dozen body coats with fine Flanders for a ready
customer, that in peace you have thus unfolded your
errand
,
and of such an honest nature it prove; for stitch my
carcass, had your object been hostilestop my trust!
but your doublet (and by this light it is of cloth, I were
loth to spoil,) would have been cut in as many squares,
bits, and ends, as a Merry Andrew's pantaloons, or as
there are running seams in a gallant's jerkin. Gads
service
!
I repeat it, right gleesome am I that you so soon
announced yourself, Meinheer De Lanoy, for had it been
another man, thof o' your quarters, seeing how much I
respect thee, having oftentimes to my profit and delight,
had both the making and fitting of thy wearing apparel
blood o' me! but he had tasted death at our hands in as
short space as ever thread pierced a bodkin's eyelet.
Troth, truly says the snyder, said a ragged looking
fellow, with a dirty leathern apron and a red flannel skull
cap, the centre of which was crowned with a large tassel
of worsted, may I never soak the soal of a pantoufle
again, but there are some among us, Mienheer, that
would have waxed you throughly; snooks! I think it
would have been shorts ere your upper leather had been
sadly tanned.
Py myn vaders baard mien vreint De Lanoy, he dells
as drue as dat I dell, py Got! added he of the mighty
breast plate, putting on a fierce and courageous manner,
had dou been oder mensch as dat dou prove, I had
daken
mien hallebaard, and mit mien hallebaard I did leavsh
dou no mores eyesh in dien kopt as dere vas den dou vas
poorn, py Got!
Yes, may I never blow bellows again, echoed another,
whose party coloured visage bore ample correspondence
with his black and dusted linen, for he was without
jerkin
,
and had his sleeves rolled up above his elbow,
exposing
to view his hairy, broad, muscular and sinewy
arms; while in one hand he held a massy iron bar, which
he wielded as a player would the quarter staff, while the
round flat cap, that scarcely hid his coarse, shaggy, and
russet coloured locks, peculiar to the artizan of the time,
bespoke his following, by the flames of my furnace,
hadst thou met us as an enemy, Peiter De Lanoy, sturdy
Peiter as thou art, I'd made thy brain fly like sparks from
hot iron. The Bayard cause for everharo and battle!
Body o' me, give old Stevens but a fair stroke, those fair
visages of yours, Mienheers, had been little better than a
rotten cinder such as I cast way in the Smidt Vly, before
Asseer Leevy's tan vats.
Good sirs, we doubt ye not, or that as things are, ye
carry stout hearts to war for the factions ye have
espoused
,
said De Lanoy with wily caution, at the same
time as he proceeded, assuming a soothing and insinuating
tone of voice, which at once calmed the angry and
party-heated
feelings of those he spoke with, weaning their
minds from antipathy and ill will, till they were carried
away in sympathy of the words of him who addressed
them; yet trust me, masters; in good faith I speak it, ye
are too eager for the blood of old comrades and friends;
and for why?to urge a stranger's interest, to push the
triumph of a man, who but yesterday ye scarce knew
breathed life: sooth, it is, methinks, somewhat unnatural
that thus soon ye should forget the sweet intercourse of
neighbourship. Yet green in its passage, does not
memory show we have been a handful in this desolate
land, a few christian men amid a desert and surrounded by
hosts of savages, from whose bloody trails yet unavenged,
the voices of the butchered call on us to give over
unnatural
feuds, and turn upon the common foethe
murthering
red man and his base ally, the cursed dogs of
Canada, whose crimes the smouldering ruins of
Schenectadie
must for ages keep fresh. Yes, my friends, forget
not that our fathers drove back from the very spot whereon
our dwellings stand, the raging panther and the howling
wolf. And heretofore in unison, we have tilled this
wilderness
;
yea, time out of mind have there been kindly
interchanges of friendship between us, that bespoke good
will; nay, there are even here many who by me have been
called by name from childhood, upwards; remember you
not our boyish sports together? and for what reason meet
we thus with ireful eyes and hands ready to deal blows of
death upon each other? Let not the early day be
renewed
,
when blood smoked from earth, and sought at the
gates of heaven vengeance on a fratricidelet not the
mark of wrath be set upon us as that which the seared
brow of the first murtherer fostered. Bethink ye,
burghers
;
is it not most horrible, thus Cain-like, to be arrayed
in armsa brother thirsting for the draught which is to be
drained from the veins,yea, from the heart of a brother!
The honest burghers seemed evidently touched with
this appeal.
There is somewhat in De Lanoy's words, murmured
one in a whisper to him who stood at his side, it is hard
to forget bygones; ay, many are the wildsome pranks
we, that is De Lanoy there and myself, have had in hand,
as Flattenburgh hill and the commons, from the swamp to
the holy ground, can bear strait witness.
In warhied dat is all dyne, mien vrients, said the
warrior in the cuirass, taking up the subject as it reached
his ear; I have had zum little vun mit him in my days
mienzelf; und a menschadagt and a frauwadagt
[12]
[12]
These were the Dutch appellations given to certain days of
peculiar
liberties and sports; on that first named, the young men were
empowered to kiss their sweethearts, without reprehension; and on
the last, the ladies were allowed to retaliate on the offenders, who
were prohibited resistance.
py Got,
in der Nieuw Nederlandts dere was nien jongmen dat
dare dans mit him and I in a zhuffle zhuffle, dough dere
hipsey saw bleased der vrauws besserho, ho, de
jongmen
now are niet zich as dat dey were den, py got.
Ay, in my day, returned one, De Lanoy has been
with us to pluck the goose; by gad he is a merry blade,
though a rare hand at nine pins.
Yes, joined in another, when we were boys it was
jovial pastime. It appears but as yesterday when we had
the cherevallie, wherein I blew the ram's horn before old
Ruckel Depeyster's door, when he married Helligunt,
the young widow of Mangle Minthorne of the Bouwerie
Laneng, De Lanoy was one who helped to plant the
maypoles
that we hung with ragged stockings under the
bridegroom's
window.
Troth, those were pleasant days, those were pleasant
days, murmured many of the burghers, as their eyes
glistened with the pleasures of the recollection.
And what claim to tear asunder the ties that hath
bound ye, boasts this man,this Sloughter? burst
unrestrainedly
from the lips of Milbourne, with tone at once fiery
and impetuous; gathering a vehement and frantic force as
he spoke, he appeared borne away with a spirit furious
and bitter, o'ermastering discretion by the violence of
his feelings:by heaven's wrath! deeply it galls me
to see men like ye act as ye have borne yourselves, with
maugre faith to man and God. I tell ye, most dastardly
have ye done;would honest men pursue your course,
and desert in need, old and tried friends to cling to the
cloak of favour? And can you give reason for such
conduct
?Ye
would say this Sloughter is Protestant;
and on that forsooth, ye builda sandy foundation
surely is it. But, let me ask, are not we of that
church? To establish the most glorious revolution,
has not my father-in-law, Jacob Leisler,who has been
a burgher of Nieuw Yorke from infancy,yea, while
like drones ye have wallowed in idleness and fattened
on the ease he made in his toils for you,has he not, I
repeat
it,labored supported by us his faithful adherents,
who in the winter of adversity forgot not summer friends;
has he not I repeat it, sacrificed his wealth, spent his time,
and shed his very blood for the good cause. And what is
the reward, to find ye, as ye are, lying sycophants, coward
traitors, who having sucked the marrow of his liberal
hand, fly him when you find the source from whence he
fed you dried, and turn hissing like horned adders upon your
benefactor But what gain hath your treachery,have the
miseries you suffered under Andross passed away, so that
no scar of the wounds he inflicted remains, yea do you no
longer remember the vile tyrant who oppressed you, have
you no thought of the chains and the prison house, have you
no memory who o'erthrew the despot, who trampled on his
power and his mandates as though one was as dust, and
the other an idiots words, who stood rocklike against the
intrigues
of Jesuits, and the machinations of the base
emissaries
of the Catholics, and the deposed James Stuart. Who
I seek in defiance of the slavish tools of that bigoted
monarch
,
cast Nicholas Renslear in prison, and who quailed not
in a dungeon to the tyranny of the arbitrary sycophant? Who
I ask made ye free, and taught ye that ye were men, no
worms to crawl innoxious about the spurner's foot; and
where in those dark days, those hours of sorrow and
distress
,
where were those you now exalt as leaders?where
was the office holding Bayard, whose name you shout
with hoarse throats, where was the rich Van Kortlandt,
and the proud Graham, where but at the sleeve of the
tyrant Andross, fit instruments for a character so odious
but go togo toI waste breath on reptiles, who crawl
in the paths which will yield them the most prey. I see
in your sullen visages ye are wedded to the route ye have
chosen, and are emulous of the vile name ye have
achieved
:ye
have fled your liberator, ye have quitted the side of
Jacob Leisler, to attach yourselves to this Sloughter; and
yet what warrant have ye that he is a better man than
the craven Sir Edmund Andross.
Although apparently there had been a slight, yet
favorable
impression made on the burghers, who composed the
patrouille, by De Lanoy's artfully bringing back to their
minds, the days of ancient league, and intimacy, so that the
hearts of some began to be changed with renovated
kindness
,
and the stern grasp with which they held their
weapons
,
unconsciously relaxed as they bethought themselves
of youthful pranks and boyish hopes, and dangers, in which
all mutually suffered or delighted, yet at the imperious
invectives
,
and ill timed and injudicious reflections, on their
own conduct, as well as of those under whose banners they
were now enlisted, and whose purposes they were the
avowed
partizans, by at once reviving in all its pristine ferocity,
the political hatred and struggles for ascendancy, and all the
individual and petty virulence of the times, banished
instantaneously
all that the finer feelings had been likely to
cherish
;
and although Milbourne for a short period, was lost as it
were in the torrent of words, which ran like the rush of
waters
over the rocks of a stream, from his lips, and whose
flow he found it impossible to control, for it seemed as if the
flood gates of his heart had burst asunder, and a gathered
store of gall sprung from heaped up wrongs, had poured
out overwhelming every barrier which caution should
have held guard upon, yet as his concluding words
plainly
intimated, ere he had finished speaking, the
miscalculated
and unadvised rashness of his advancing at such a
time, and place, and before such an audience, the
sentiments
and remarks he had used, presented itself forcibly
to his thoughts; for while warmed and fired by the
fruitful
matter that filled his imagination, the story of the
injurious returns received for the labors of himself and
friends, for the public weal, he could hear, see, nor think
of aught about him, and was absent from all but the cause
that had awakened his feelings; but no sooner had he found
a moments breathing space to gaze about, his bosom
filled with an expectant hope, even amid the bitter
indignation
that swelled it, that he had shamed the opposers
of the Leisler party into repentance, and submissions, ere
he became fully aware of his imprudence, by the stern and
unopposing silence, by which his words were received,
and the dark and chilling aspect of the burghers. And in
the moment of fretful anger, that sprung from such
disappointment
,
he added the last sentence, which partaking
the feeling of the moment, fell from his lips like the last
drop of poison, drained from the venomous tooth, of the
expiring rattlesnake. There was a dead and speechless
interval, when the son-in-law of Leisler paused, and the
latest tone of his voice was borne away in the night breeze.
There motionless for awhile stood the patrouille, like
dusky
and fixed statues; but this lasted not long, it was but
an instant space such as when the tiger draws in his breath,
and strengthens his limbs for a bound, upon the body of
the hunter's elephant. At first there arose a deep
murmur
,
like the groan of some mighty oak, ere the tempest
is raised, or like the distant roar of artillery, heard from
afar on the ocean, it was the vengeful interchange of an
angered crowd, urging and encouraging those who
composed
it, to deeds of violence.
And was such the aim of your peaceful embassy,
exclaimed
one in a tone of fierce and bitter irony, came ye
then to raise sedition among us?
Accursed slanderer? cried the artizan, in a voice
hoarse with rage, did you but seek our lines to throw
firebrands
of revolt amid our ranks, and to light up the coals
of rebellion, in a band of loyal subjects.
Foul tongued defamer, quoth another angrily,
bring you to us naught but insult, for what dare you use
words of shame, to those within the reach of whose
poniards
ye stand.
For the sake of heaven friends hear me, indeed
ye have mistaken that which my comrade hath spoke,
said De Lanoy, in vain striving to retrieve the ground,
that had been so wantonly lost by Milbourne's
impetuosity
;
but needless were his endeavours at interposition; the
attempt appeared merely to have an effect of increasing
the tumult of the incensed burghers against Milbourne,
and likewise to awake its fury towards himself, for such is
the blinded nature of the passions of humanity, that a
weak and failing interference, is more likely to cater fresh
food for excitement, than to allay its force, as some
feeble
barrier built against the current of some rushing
mountain stream, serves but awhile, to stop the falling
of the waters, whose violence congregated, and whose
mass raised with unmeasured height, at length o'ertops
the puny obstacle, that had withheld the running tide, and
in its might bears it in scattered fragments, in its roaring
race, until every particle is lost in the dashings of the
multitudinous
waves.
And for this did De Lanoy use his smooth tongue?
said one eyeing the person he spoke of, with a look of
rage, we'll listen no more to his cunning lies, we should
have remembered that this is not the first time, he has
beguiled us to ruin.
He hath spoken of our ancient days, next he will
persuade
us of Leisler's kindness and humanity, echoed
another with scowling brow, but for that, let him go look
at my houseless and despoiled family, my lands barren and
untilled, confiscated as he would term them, not however
by an Andross, but by the accursed and arbitrary edict of
Jacob Leisler.
Who prates of that man's services to the colony,
thundered
a stern tone, I grant him active in driving the
cattle
from the homesteads of honest yeomenah! in his
wrath he has laid desolate my hearth and home, because
forsooth, I chose to adhere to the fortunes of such as
were born my superiors, and jested at the rule of one
sprung from the kennel.
Vol. II. 11
Ay, talk ye knaves of justice and ingratitude, spoke
loudly others, go to your dungeons and see if their bare
and dank walls, confine not men, such as from your births,
ye had been honored to clear the doorway for their steps,
hold not your chains Nicholas Bayard, and the worthy
descendant of Governor Nichols.
Haro, cry down with James Stuart, the Jesuits, and the
whore of Babylon, shouted many, their sway was a
hundred times better than these dirt bred rulers, these
offspring of lowest earth, Milbourne and Leisler.
The resentment of the irritated burghers, appeared as
it were quickened by the reproaches that had burst in
outcries from their angry lips, and could their menacing
looks and ireful brows, have been seen as in the daylight,
they would have spoken a language, at once fearful and
warning to the rash offender, who had thus heedless of
consequence, touched the avalanche that tottered, but for
a breath to fall in overwhelming ruin,yea as it were
franticly
thrust his naked and uncovered hand in the den of
the cockatrice; yet there was sufficient for alarm, in the
manner in which the patrouille had slowly closed upon
Milbourne and his companions, and by which movement
the burghers almost encompased their enemies, and
approached
so near, that their adverse weapons wanted but
a slight impetus, to strike at their opposing bodies; and
again there was that in the startling sound of their
advance
,
the hollow noise of their heavy footsteps, and the
clattering of their arms, that gave to their opponents a
sudden, although a certain insight, of the danger which
surrounded them on every side, and made the more
apparent
the weakness of their array, and the defence which
it was possible to offer to such a body of men, infuriated
and superior in force and numbers. The mind of
Milbourne
however, was not in a frame to bear the contumelious
attacks that had alike been made on his own character, and
that of his faction; blinded by a mad zeal for power, and an
unchecked pride of spirit, that had grafted on a nature
genial from birth, grown from a late unbounded sway, it
would have been worse than death, for him to bend his
haughty soul, and seek peace or give way in the least, to
those who even yet he considered as a herd beneath
him; indeed he was not one to beseech, or tamper with
the vexed and resentful, for rather than sooth the tempest
to a calm, he joyed in braving its might; and however for
an instant the chilling aspect of the situation of himself,
and the friends who accompanied him, may have
presented
itself to his thought, and checked his ardour and
boldness
,
it was but as a brief fall of water, on some raging
flame, that dampens and beats down the bickering light,
with its momentary weight, but which in the end only
causes an increase of the streaming blaze; yea even the
very knowledge of the hazard in which he stood, seemed
an addition to the food of his passionate resistance:
Dastard
losels, dare ye parley thus to me, cried he in a tone
whose energy was strengthened by the ire that pervaded
him, so that although his lips trembled and grew white, yet
his blood ran as it were a liquid of molten lead in his veins,
and fire flashed from his eye hate and defiance on his
adversaries
,
dare ye dishonest mongrels breathe your venomous
lies and wag your noxious tongues in my presence and
hearing
,
may God's curse on Egypt light upon ye all, consuming
and scathing your false hearts to ashes. What, do you press
upon my guard?back curs; dogs, back I say,or, by
the power that made me, ye will raise a destroyer among
ye that ye little wot of withal:ay, I will rip with this
good steel your foul breasts apart, and wash out with the
best blood ye have, your latest life's blood, the accursed
calumnies ye harbour and have presumed to prate against
those who have been unjust to themselves, that ye are
now free to utter the scandal.
Poco-a-poco, and is it come to that, santissama
Espirito
!
messmate, give us a fair sweep with my toledo,
ere you bear down, exclaimed Eumet, eagerly
flourishing
his hanger, after having been a silent, though not an
inattentive observer of what had passed; carja, we've
a flota against us, but here's the hand that'll stem the
tidewe'll try these landsmen's mettle; thof I've
known 'em to speak bold enow; yet no nos concoenios,
as we say on the mainthe lubbers turn as white as the
mainsheet, at the sight of the galerdeta of a true
marinero
so,
hard ahelm, hearties, and lay 'em aboard.
For an instant the sturdy burghers were overawed, and
gave back in their advance, daunted by the bared and
glittering steels that flashed before them and confronted
their approach upon their opposers; but it was but for a
single step they retreated, for reanimated by a sense of their
strength and the fewness of their foes, they quickly
regained
their vantage, threatening with ferocious haste to
overwhelm their antagonists.
What, are we braved by such as these! roared the
artizan in a hoarse and brattling tone, and furiously
shaking aloft the bar which his hand held with a powerful
grasp, as if it had been a billet of the lightest wood;
nay, neighbours, shame not yourselves by a retreating
step, but drive the hounds, as though they were but ashes
to scatter by the wind.
On them, burghers,on them, cried one; beat
them down to dust;we are ten to one, and will teach
the rogues better counsel than they have yet born.
Nay, masters, let me but have a moment to explain;
ye are all acting madly, and will rue these angry steps;
said De Lanoy, striving to no purpose, for an opportunity
to prevent the direful consequence that evidently was
about to ensue and follow the fearful breach of amity that
had so unwisely been made.
List him no word, but onwardstear them in atoms!
thundered, or rather yelled, a dozen voices, drowning in
the fierce outcry, the efforts of pacification: on to the
death, and spare no life! was shouted by others in tones
that made the very air ring with the sound, as if it was
shaken by the sharp report of a cannon.
And in all probability it would have taken but a short
time, judging from the frightful resolution by which the
patrouille were actuated, and the terrific thirst for
retribution
for the scornful language they had received, that
pervaded their bosoms, to have executed their purpose
of destruction, for adjoined to the other infinite
advantages
possessed by the burghers over the slender
weapons
of their adversaries, was that a moment's
unfortunate
indecision, or rather wonder at the frenzy of their
opponents on the part of Milbourne and his fellows, who,
as it were, startled at the screams of insatiable revenge,
that deafened them from every side, (as one having
thrust, in wantonness or by accident, the match in some
loaded magazine, would be astounded at the terrible
explosion
,
surpassing in its loudness all he had ever
pictured
,)
had afforded the burghers of the patrouille a
chance unscathed to crowd so near upon them that there
was no room for a sweep of the swords, which, in a
manner
became useless, borne down by the weight of pikes,
clubs, and the other rude though powerful arms of the
citizens
;
indeed so tight was the struggle, that Eumet
abandoning
his trusty steel, sought in haste to level his arquebuss
with deadly aim, but he had scarce loosened it from the
supporting bandalier ere a dozen hostile hands had
grasped
it firmly, and strove to wrench it from his hold, which,
in spite of his furious endeavours at defence was soon
effected
,
and he himself beaten down almost senseless amid
the trampling feet of the combatants, while in vain also
were the desperate strivings of Milbourne and De Lanoy
to contend in the unequal conflict, for although many of
the sturdy burghers were unused and awkward in the
wielding of their offensive weapons, and their strokes
readily parried, making their part of the fight attended
with more ludicrous noise and clatter than serious risk or
danger, yet there were those whose strength of arm was
death bearing, and the splintered rapiers of their
opponents
appeared a speedy omen of the enforcement of the
threats of utter annihilation, that was hoarsely shrieked
above the tumult of the contest.
Death to the hated miscreants! was echoed in fierce
cry from mouth to mouth, as the assured issue of the
combat
became momently the more evident.
Aye, tear them in pieces! cried the artizan,
maddened
by success, hear no call for life, but leave the
dogs not an atom of flesh, that shall not be a gout of
gore.
This last horrid encouragement was received by a
tremendous
shout of assent, that spoke as with a voice of
despair to the hearts of the failing partizans of the
Leislerian
faction, whose fate now looked inevitable, and to
whom it appeared as if there was no means of
preservation
11*
or escape from death left; yet at the very instant
the fatal result so surely to be anticipated, was about
accomplishment
,
at the very moment as it were, the
suspended
blow of destruction was about to fall,for at the
time of the artizan's denunciation, Milbourne and his
companions
were completely at the mercy of their foemen,
and above their unguarded and now defenceless heads,
waved halberd, musquetoon, pike, and club, ready to
descend
and scatter blood, brain, and life to dust,at that
last stress, other voices than those engaged in fight, rang
with cries of forbearance on the breeze, and the uplifted
weapons simultaneously were withdrawn harmless from
their direful threatening, as by the hand of enchantment.
Hold! hold this disturbance! exclaimed the strangers,
here comes the burgerwagt.
The burgomasters! the burgomasters! back,
Mienheers
,
back! said those of the patrouille, one to the
other: yet keep an eye on the captivesback!
masters
,
back!
As the patrouille divided and gave way, through the
opening left thereby, between the adverse parties, the
new comers advanced: they were a considerable body of
armed citizens headed by two magistrates, who having
been alarmed by the noise of battle and tumult had quickly
departed the city for the scene of contest on the
Marktvlet
,
and although their steps had been lighted by
flambeaux
of blazing pine splinters, making their path as day,
yet such had been the eagerness and engrossed minds of
those engaged in the fray, that these had not been
perceived
,
although a considerable distance had to be
crossed
from the beaver gracht, the street from whence the
burgomasters and their followers entered on the plain to
attain the spot where the combat was carried on; where
having arrived, the two important dignitaries who took
the lead, strode forward with solemn, slow, and becoming
gait and bearing, and gazed in wonderment on the ireful
adversaries. They were both short, squabby looking men
of unwieldy shape, the one apparently in size but little
superior to the other, and both resembling cushions well
stuffed; they wore huge three cornered cocked hats,
with monstrous bunches of yellow ribbons stuck in the
place of cockades, as insignias of their faithful adherence
to the prince of Orange, William the Third, King of
England
,
and their approbation of the protestant revolution;
the one was close wrapped in a monstrous night gown of
staring red flannel, well tucked round his throat to keep
out the cold, while the other, more hardy in the city's
service, no way concealed his under dress by outward
cloak or wrapper, but shown in his lead coloured jerkin,
with mettle buttons, his yellow breeches, and paste
shoe-buckles
,
all of which were sufficiently visible in the torch
light. These personages bore in their hands, the more
as emblematical of their station than as assistance to
their steps, a tall mahogany stick, the top of which was
crowned by a carved acorn blazing in Dutch mettle; this
was called a burgomaster's wand, and even unto this day
hath the custom come for the chosen rulers of the city to
bear on momentous occasions a like emblem of their
consequence.
Pugh! pugh! what is thepugh! pugh! I have lost
mypugh!breath! spoke the last described character,
with thick and hasty utterance, puffing and blowing with
the fatigue he had just endured in bringing, or rather
rolling
,
his mighty carcass to the place of disturbance;
What in the fiend's name's the matter? pugh! what a
race I have had!pugh! pugh!who the devil has had
the audacitypugh!to kick up such a dust; pugh!
breaking the peace of his highness' loyal subjects, and
pugh!that of the puissant burgomasters of the honest
city of Nieuw Yorke? Here is some one, brother
Gelyn
pugh!that
is desirous of the stocks, the wooden
horse, or thepugh!cucking stool.
Ja, Mienheer Filkins, replied the other dignitary
pompously, dis is most lyk dis is zo; ja, Mienheer
Filkins.
Sirs, a most grievous and violent breach of faith, hath,
by these men of yours, been committed against us, said
Milbourne hastily, stepping forward and addressing the
potent burgomasters, we came from Jacob Leisler to
have an interview and treat for terms whereby peace
might be restored to all, with Colonel Sloughter; but
disregarding
the sacred character we bear, and which even
De Frontenac's salvages would have respected, as you
behold, they have met us with the sword's point, and, but
for your timely presence, even now we had been foully
butchered by their villanous hands.
How now? pugh! how now? exclaimed
burgomaster
Filkins, what's this? pugh! what's this I hear?
The false-tongued hound liesbasely lies! cried
the artizan: body o' me! under pretence of friendly
errand they came; I grant his say so; but they forgot
that pretext, when, with poisonous lip they strove to
wind us from our dutiesbut they found true steel, not
to be bent;and it was to retaliate the slurs he cast on us
in disappointment that we would have slain him, and his
dogs who follow at his heels. May I never screw an
anvil more if I could not now beat to death the
treacherous
knaves.
Thou worm! said Milbourne, shaking in defiance
his shattered steel; thou talkest brave; but had I to
meet thee on equal ground, palsy wither my arm but I
would make thee change thy boastful vaunt.
How! speak ye thatspeak ye that? returned the
artizan, raising his bar as about to strike down his
opponent
;
by the breath o' me, thou shalt rue thy words,
master.
Huti-tuti! Mienheers, do you forget who's present?
pugh! here's a todo, a hubbub, to be surepugh! quoth
Alderman Filkins, interposing his authority between the
disputants: a fine riot here, brother Verplank.
Mienheer Filkins, ja, said burgomaster Verplank,
dis is besser sbordt dan to zee der haanekamp in
vrouw Schakerly's haanemat, at der Old Slib. I'll bet
you, Mienheer, dree dotkin on smidt Stevens; don't let's
sboil der sbort, Mienheer Filkins.
It wont do, it wont do, brother Verplank; it would be
a blot on the laws of the Council of this citypugh!
answered
burgomaster Filkins, ye had better make it up,
Mienheers, ye had better make it up.
What, shall they go unharmed and free? exclaimed
several of the patrouille, indignantly.
Shall we not trample down these friends of Leisler?
muttered others.
Huti-tuti, masters! who is the judge of the best, you
or I?pugh! quoth the burgomaster, drawing himself
up; would you take the law in your own hands?
pugh!for what was I elected burgomaster?pugh!
to be dictated to?pugh!I tell you ye had better make
it uppugh!for if you don't, as sure as my name's
Filkins
,
I'll have you all whipped in the rasp huis yard, for
las majestatis; which means, not obeying my commands
pugh!
The patrouille remained doggedly silent, which was,
however, favourably construed into acquiescence on their
part by the lordly and puissant burgomaster, who now,
in his turn, most courteously extended an offer of safe
escort to the rescued Milbourne and his companions to
the presence of Colonel Sloughter, which, of course was
eagerly accepted by them. And after numerous
admonitions
from the burgomasters to the patrouille to restrain
their impetuosity at aggression, though at the same time
to keep watchful guard, the partizans of Leisler
departed
in company of the magistrates towards the city,
leaving the patrouille at their stations, gazing on their
retiring
forms with unsatiated hatred and vowing revenge.
There let them go! said the artizan, glancing on
their fading forms a look as spiteful as that with which
the fretted and caged hyena scares the spectator from his
sight, fearing that the iron bars of his prison may be too
weak to hold the enraged beast: There let them go, in
the fiend's name, said he, their good fortune hath it
been that now they were not stiff and cold before us
yet body o' me, the time shall yet be when this arm of
mine shall yield the dogs death.
Nay, Smidt Stevens, an Sloughter act the man;
said onemore fitting hands for them will do the office
you seek; the rope and the hangman's kiss be their
portion
.
Death, to the hated miscreants! murmured in stern
accord the whole patrouille.
In the meanwhile, safe from the anger of their ruthless
enemies, the objects of these menaces proceeded with
their doughty conductors across that part of the
marktvliet
that separated them from the city, and passing the
narrow entrance of the marktvelt-steegje,
[13]
[13]
Now called Marketfield-street, or Petticoat Lane.
they pursued
their way towards the great dyke which ran in the centre
of the town. As they moved along, the torches that were
borne in the train flashed with strong red blaze upon the
dark and night shadowed houses of the burghers of Nieuw
Amsterdam, lightening for an instant with fitful ray, the
gay painted brick and heavy rock stone of which they
were built; and often the green glass of some hastily
opened casement, gave back, alike with the glazed tiles
of the steep roofs, from whence the snow had slid away,
and whose smooth surface shone like mirrors of polished
steel, the trembling reflection of the passing flambeaux;
although, when they first entered the dark lane, whose
rough path of half frozen mud and snow they were obliged
to thride, to gain the thicker settled part of the city, all
seemed dark, still, and solitary, unbroken by voice or
step of passenger, and the long line of buildings, whose
gable ends fronting the way, frowned on them as they
went beneath, without sign of living thing inhabiting them,
and looking like rows of funeral mounds, so stirless and
desolate they were; yet as they hastened onwards, the
scene changed: the tumult of afar off crowds was heard,
the trampling of many feet and cries of people rushing to
and fro; soon was seen lights, and groups of men
hurrying
confusedly along or collecting in throngs as if in
discourse
;
and then came blasts of martial music on the air,
the sound of trumpets and of kettle drums; the windows
of many dwellings were thrown open, and by the blaze
of their night lamps, the masters looked forth on the busy
gathering of their neighboursevery body appeared
anxious
and stirring.
By mine office,pugh!this hath been a restless
and fatiguing nightpugh!for the city authorities,
quoth burgomaster Filkins, in the saints name, brother
Gelyn,pugh!I think they had better make matters
uppugh!
Ja, Mienheer Filkins, replied the other dignitary,
dere is no vun in disja, I wants beace, for I have bet
mine dwo year golt to run against Mienheer de Witt's
merrie
vor dwo bushel of seawant. Mienheer Filkins, I bet you
your dotkins on mine golt; dere ish not his lyk dis zide
of Bestavers Killetje: he will drot out Peiter de Witt's
merrie. If you can zettle dings mit der stadtwogd,
Mienheer
Delanoy, you will zee mien golt on der gorse, and I
will bet mit dee.
Sincerely, burgomaster, answered De Lanoy, do
I desire that such may happen, and that friendship
once again may be the bond between us, and that in our
native sports and exercise we may alike meet in amity;
and if such luck fall, Mienheer Verplank, I will not
retreat
from your challenge, and stand ready to wager.
The burgomasters and their companions having now
crossed one of the light wooden bridges that was thrown
across the canal that led up the heeren gracht, began to
wend their way down the hoog street;
[14]
[14]
After called Little Dock-street, and was on a line (though
nearer Stone-street) with the present Pearl-street.
here the throng
increased, and it seemed as if the inhabitants of the whole
place had poured towards this one quarter, a motley group
of every sort and calling; striplings and grown men.
Here was the mean clad mechanic, and there the rich
attired shopman, all girt, however, with such arms as they
could procure, and mustering by the light of many torches
as it were a time of deadliest need and danger. The
character of Milbourne and his two associates was soon
made known to these, and their reception from the
rabble
was such as to show the resentful hate which was felt
towards them: groans, hisses, and cries assailed them
from every side: down with Leisler, down with
Milbourne
and De Lanoy, their reign is overa new time
hath come! was fiercely shouted around them; some
had even the hardihood to confront them in their path,
and shake their pikes and clubs in their faces, by way of
insult; others threw balls of ice at them as they walked
by, and huzzaed and threw up their caps for Sloughter
and his new Council. The light foam stood on the lips
of Milbourne, and his visage was convulsed with passion,
as he returned the angry glances of his enemies with a
look of spite and rage equal to their own, and had it not
been for the judicious conduct of the magistrates, his fury
would soon have broken bounds, and he would have burst
in some act of open violence on those who had so
grievously
assaulted him: but the burgomasters, finding their
authority exerted in vain, to quell the attacks of the crowd,
turned quickly and precipitately into a by-way, and in a
short time with rapid pace left the aggressors behind them,
the rabble forbearing to follow their retreating steps.
The path they had now taken was called by the Dutch
sleyk steeg.
[15]
[15]
Was situate where Mill-street now runs.
or mire lane, and led in the rear of the stadt
huis, and passing by that building, opened on Coenties
slip, whereon the stadthuis fronted; ere entering on the
slip, however, they paused a moment to take breath from
their hasty flight, and gave a quick glance on the scene
before them, while the puissant burgomasters sought to
renovate their wearied frames and recover their lost
wind, ere they ushered themselves in the presence of his
excellency, Colonel Henry Sloughter, Governor of their
Majesties' loyal province of New-Yorke.
The whole slip, from the wooden step of the stadthuis
to the tall masted skippers that lay moored at water's
edge, under the breastwork of the rondell, seemed a
moving mass of men, of burghers and schutters
indiscriminately
mixed, and all apparently busied in warlike
preparation
;
all was alive with torch and flambeauxhere
was heard the clattering of the artizan's hammer, as the
drake or pedero was mounted on its carriage and
levelled
at the direction of the walls of the fort, whose white
bulwarks on the distant hill looked like drifts of snow,
and again were repeated from others words of marshalling
and array; yet the proceedings of the persons who
composed
what appeared to be the principal group, were
such as mostly engaged the attention of those who looked
on the stirring scene; for although the eye found for
awhile amusement in the labours and movements of the
busied and industrious burghers, and drew a faithful
conclusion
from their actions of the motives that inspired
their conduct; (for here was one zealous and single
souled
with the spirit of party, and there was another at his
side, toiling alike in forwarding the purpose of his fellow,
though actuated by a very different feeling, selfish to
provide
for his own safety and interest, nevertheless,
apparently
emulous of hazard in the cause he had espoused,
as if for its own sake;) yet last, the observer rested solely
on that chief point of attraction, from which all the
objects
that engaged the attention of the commoner had
seemed to emanate, or at any rate took direction, the
station
of such, who, from their manner and bearing, claimed
authority of those who thronged within the presence, the
spot where the Governor himself stood, attended by such
who had already felt the sunshine of his favour, and were
installed in power near his person. In very different
guise and appearance from what the narration left him,
was Henry Sloughter. Recruited by a lapse of several
hours, food, rest, sleep, and many comforts had his
wornout
frame enjoyed; renovated by these somewhat of its
ancient freshness had been restored to his cheek, and the
brightness of the eagle glance to his hazle eye, late dim
and faded as by the palsied touch of age; the faintness and
sickness of his weary travel were gone, and he strode firm
and proud in manly strength, yet there was a paleness and
haggard cast upon his countenance, but whether the hue
was such as sprung from a life of wassail and debauchery,
and was no stranger to his visage, (for such a life he was
said to have passed from his earliest youth upwards,) or
was the effect of the sufferings he had so late endured, a
dying mark such as the plague leaves on the brow of the
rescued victim of its rage, was hard to determine; albeit
his voice was deeply toned, commanding and martial, and
his fine though sallow features darkened, by locks whose
sable die vied with the black-bird's wing, and hung over
Vol. II. 12
his forehead like the dank and drooping foliage of a
weeping willow, gave him the bold frank look of a
warrior
;
and such indeed he was, but unfortunately for the
province whose destinies he for awhile was appointed to
direct, and whose sole government he possessed, his looks
were his greatest virtue; his appointment to the office,
whose duties he was about entering on, was an unhappy
one, considering the turbulent and disorderly state
committed
to his will.
To direct the helm of power at the time of this history,
there was wanting a man peculiarly talented, of
conciliating
disposition, yet active and determined in his
resolutions
;
one who at this critical conjuncture, was able by his
influence, as well to reconcile a divided people, as to
defend them against the wiles of a cunning adversary;
the implacable foe of the English, DeFrontenac. Though by
nature Colonel Sloughter was a man of energetic and
thinking mind, capable of much; yet from an habitual
indolence
,
a wayward and idle spirit, this quality was of
but little worth to him, and except in times of the utmost
need its possessor seldom brought it in play, and even
then too often, the better capacities lay dormant,
deadened by the effects of riot and dissipation: there were
indeed certain periods when as if stung by a scorpion,
recollection
darting through him, conscience was alive, and
he felt that he misused the blessing he possessed, and that
he had been created for better things than he had
accomplished
,
yet this reflection was but of brief duration, like
wells of sparkling water in the barren desert, few and
wide wastes between; so that the space of his
administration
was weak, short, and troublous, as might from his
character have been expected, for he wasted that time
which should have been passed in the public service, in
the pursuit of libidinous pleasures, the thirst for which
had been instilled as it were, into his very being, by
the fashion of the dissipated and luxurious court of
Charles the Second, to whom in his boyhood he had been a
page, and he became a ready instrument in the hands
of the ambitious and designing, who in his new
advancement
had attached themselves to his interest
and by his own reckless conduct, went far to prove the
dark outlines given by the historian of his character,
for in speaking of him, it is said, that either in the
hurry of the king's affairs, or the powerful interest
of a favourite, a man was sent over, utterly destitute of
every qualification for government, licentious in his
morals, avaricious and poor. However, at the present
introduction of this personage, he appeared alive to the
stirring spirit of the time; there was neither the inertness
or imbecility of indolence about him, and he strove to
implant
on the minds of those who surrounded him, an
impression of his activity, favourable to his first essay
in his new government. But unfortunately, the latent fire
within him was awakened, rather by the opposition that
had been offered to his explicit demand of submission, and
the acknowledgement of the high authority and
commission
with which he was invested, than by a stern sense of
the fulfilment of his duty; and, indeed, the misguided
obstinacy of Leisler and his partisans had a strong
influence
on a temper by nature quick and revengeful
arousing the worst passions, confirming the dislike which
the Anti-Leislerian factionists, (who had gained his ear,)
had with wily insidiousness instilled into his ready
reception
,
into a bitter hatred; so that he now superintended,
and urged forward the preparations of hostility against
the infatuated Hollander and his partisans, with the
emulation
of one devoted to the interest of the inveterate
foes of the Nieuw Nederlander, more than with the calm
decision and deliberate procedure behoving him, who,
from the lofty place he held, and considering the
circumstances
of the period, should rather have sought, by even
absolute sacrifices, in some instances, (but which would
have been merely temporary,) to have soothed the wounded
feelings, and healed the breaches that the disorders of the
revolution had made in the bosom of the oppositionists; or
at any rate, have forborne all violent exigency, should the
chance have presented itself, than to have pursued matters
to the utmost measure of the sword. But even had there
been an opportunity for such better principle,there were
those at his hand who would not have allowed it sway; their
endeavours being alone at strengthening and inflaming the
frame of mind in which he was:nor were such efforts
thrown away. Within the circle of his step was to be
seen the haughty form of Van Kortlandt, returned, as it
were by magic, from his exile, called by the sudden and
scarce to be expected change of affairs that was taking
place, and by his presence, showing how long digested
was the powerful movement that had been made against
his enemy, and how deep, yet how covered, were the
pitfalls that had been dug in the path of the blinded
Leisler
.
And there too, anxiously prying into every
whispered
secret, and peering through the crowd of his
fellows
,
rose the thin, harsh features of Graham, while his
wily eye darted, like the piercing orbs of a snake, on all
about him: and close to his side stood the heavy and
brawny form, and stolid and unmoved visage of Richard
Ingoldsby, while the long white locks of the fugitive
Edsell waved in the thronging crowd of fawners, who
sought the attention of their new master. Such was the
unfavourable and unpropitious aspect that Milbourne and
De Lanoy were about to brave in the parlance they had
sought;advancing, as it were, to an encounter with a
host of ruthless and unforgiving foes, rendered more
inveterate by the opening prospect of success that lay
before them, and keenly alive to the recent injuries
they had received.
Favoured by the obscurity of Coentjes Alley, (in which
they stood,) to whose gloomy and narrow-mouthed entrance
unpierced by the lights in front, two huge buttonwood
trees, (one of which rested its branches on the eaves of
the roof of the stadthuis itself, and afforded in summer
an umbrageous retreat to hundreds of swallows and
martins
who built their nests undisturbed in its sacred
branches, and round whose body near the ground, were
fastened benches for the accommodation of the burghers
who felt inclined to sit thereon and smoke their pipes, and
listen to the news that might be stirring of a summer eve;
for the place was a resort for politicians and all such idle and
windy characters;) added additional darkness: and not
being distant many yards from where Sloughter and the
group about him were; (for although by means of a wooden
railing that girted the stoeb of the stadthuis, they were
forced to make a considerable circuit to attain the
governor's
presence,) yet from the alley, Milbourne and his
companions were so near him, that they had an
uninterrupted
sight, and even could hear all that was going on,
at once distinguishing the forms and attitudes and voices
of the speakers. Sufficient time also was granted their
curiosity, from the tardiness of the worthy burgomasters
under whose protection they were thrown. For these
dignitaries, foreseeing no small exertion would be
necessary
for them to make their way, even when backed by
their magisterial influence, through the numbers that
intervened ere they could get to the presence they
desired
and wished to conduct their convoy, and being also
not a little wearied by the labour already undergone,
appeared by no means desirous of being in a hurry to
adventure their comely persons in the perils of the
jostling
throng, but wisely took a brief space to make up their
minds and prepare their bodies for the hazard, and
watched
an auspicious moment to commence their progress.
In the meanwhile, the bosoms of the adherents of
Leisler beat indignant as their eyes scanned with ireful
glances the heart-galling scene that was passing within
their view; for what dagger, though driven to the heart,
can give more pain;what poisonous liquid in the
chymist's calendar can deeper seeth the soul, as it were
with burning flame, than to hearken to faithless lips pouring
out their ingrateful tales;yea, listen to the words of the
hypocritethe fly, that lived in the warmth of our
chamber
unharmed, and fostered by our succourin
congratulation
of the triumph of a mortal enemy over our
miseries;to mark the flowings of the self-same fable,
the specious falsehood that beguiled our confidence,
used for the purpose of gaining place in the favour of
another, and those vows that we believed savoured of a
sole devotion, readily transformed in attachment to our
deadliest enemies; and worse than this,subservient to
the new alliance, the very favours received from our
cheated friendship become the theme of mockery and
12*
derisiona banquet catered by the time-serving
sycophants
on whom they had been heedlessly bestowed, to
gratify the malignancy of the new object of their
dissimulation
;and
such was now the case; for Sloughter, at
the moment, was receiving the joyous greetings of a herd
of courtiers, who moved as well by the appearance of
success that favoured the speedy issue of the conflict, with
the stubborn deniers of his authority that the time
presented
,
as by sanguine hopes of advancement, by early
declaration of amicable sentiments on his entrance on the
first step of his office;and among these might be
noticed
not a few, who, on the former part of the evening,
hovered in the sphere of Leisler's influence, and
appeared
at his call the most strenuous of his servants and
advocates
.
The reader most probably has some slight
remembrance
of Mienheer Jacobus Kip's pointed though brief
remarks, in the conclusion of the first section of this book
of the narrative, for the personage among these latter
worthies
,
who was most conspicuous in thrusting himself in
the eye of the Governor was the same character, the
outlines
of whose virtues, the shrewd schepen remarked on
in a manner which was not only forcible but true;for
foremost in the troop came Dirk Van Rikketie, than
whom no man was more indebted to Leisler for
promotion
and fortune, and than whom from unsteadiness
of faith, none was more undeserving, and who
disregarding
every honourable tie, no sooner could form an
accurate judgment of the flowing of the tides than he
sought the very first chance proffered to lend his
assistance
to the destruction of his patron; nay, not content
with utter desertion, with the eager avidity of a long
injured
and determined foe, Dirk sought to pull down to
dust the idol by whose pedestal he had hung in worship,
and strove as though his life depended on it to
overwhelm
in ruin the man who, worthless as he was, had
placed him high in office; for Leisler, on the dereliction
of Bayard, had bestowed on Dirk the two important public
places of the colony, the one known as Geheim Schryver,
or Recorder of Secrets, the other as Receiver General of
the Revenues; and these stations Dirk had now for some
time filled with considerable profit to himself, and with an
excellent eye to his own interest; and being withal much
used to the duties of the offices, he had no desire to
resign
them, and this, together with what appeared to be the
popular voice, for that, no matter how adverse to justice,
was solely Dirk's guiding star, were most probably the
motives
for the present conduct which he pursued; for he is
to be acquitted of all inveteracy of heart, for he was one
who would not harm a worm if he thought he could gain
nothing by his inhumanity.
The looks of this creature bespoke but little of his
origin, as well as the contamination of the world of
intrigue
in which he had for many years been engaged, had
altered his feelings. His father was a good substantial
yeoman, who industriously tilled his fruitful acres at
Newtown
,
(a little Yankee settlement on the Mattouwac,) and
had designed his son to the same following, when he (the
old man) was gathered to his fathers; for the child bespoke
not in infant years aught beyond common faculties;
nevertheless
Dirk was an adventurous spirit, and not to be tied
down to such honest livelihood, for he soon found it took
small knowledge or tact to become a knave, and his first
lessons of experience were reaped from pilfering water
melon
patches and orchards, in which essays he always had the
address to escape detection, or turn by artful falsehood
punishment
on the heads of his innocent playmates.
Emboldened
by his young operations, he soon hit on the line of his
abilities, and was articled to some pettifogging
Connecticut
attorney, (a species of animals that were fast
collecting
in the new colonies of America, like the maggot, who
soon calls his armies where'er there is fresh carrion to
feed on.) From his master, Dirk learnt more lessons of
sheer villany than even his own ingenious brain had
heretofore
believed existing, but what he was taught was not
wasted, but rather improved by his fertile mind, and
perfected
to an adept he entered on his practice in
New-Yorke
;
there it was not long ere by dint of his
accommodating
temper, which of course fitted itself to all
occasions
,
he brought himself into notoriety, and from one
degree
to another he was lifted to the favour he enjoyed.
Dirk was, in personal appearance, little, mean, and
insignificant
,
though studiously habited, with eye dull,
unmeaning
and vacant by nature, but which was lighted up by a
wild and habitual quickness and condescension of
countenance
,
which was alike extended to Mienheer de Heer,
the burgomaster, or to Corneljse the fisherman, which
nominal applied to a well known dirty losel, but who
was uncommonly meddlesome in the politics of the period,
and thereby often from his free expression of sentiments,
was elevated to the exercise of the whipping post or the
dignity of the stocks; yea, the same smile that with
affable
kindness lit up Dirk's visage beamed on the
prosecutor
and the culprit whom he sentenced in the course of
his office, which gave him a place on the bench in der
hoofdt scout hof, (a sort of court held by the mayor and
burgomasters, in the rasp huis hall, for the purpose of
trying and awarding summary punishments to drunken
Indians, thieving negroes, and other petty delinquents, and
in some measure answering to the court formerly called
Mayor's Court, by which name the records of the time in
some instances term the one in question, although the
authority of the court of burgomasters appears in certain
cases to have extended to denouncing on criminals the
sentence
of death, or having their tongues perforated with red
hot iron.) Yet there was no convict so low, or whose crime
was so atrocious, but Dirk addressed with the words,
mien zeer vreint, and was ready to shake hands with
him under the rope and wish him well through his
punishment
;
nevertheless, be it confessed, Dirk was sometimes
very severe and inflexible, but in such cases, the hue and
cry of the populace directed his manner, and from such
judicious
bearing there is no reason to suppose that Dirk did
not deserve the appellations which were universally ceded
as his due, of a smart, cunning fellow, and `an independent
and upright judge;' indeed Dirk was the adoration of all
the city of Nieuw Amsterdam, for he was ready to help any
one in difficulty with his advice, and to give any body a
good character, so as it was not contrary to public feeling
or his own peculiar advantage; in truth he was one
whose equanimity was a source of admiration: he was
always like the surface of a mirror, smooth, clear, and
unruffled;but not like the glass was he to be looked into;
he was, nevertheless, patient under insult, and if he
thought it of moment, would kiss the foot that spurned
him, and beat down by his courtesy all enmity, for the
veriest contempt was received by him as one would receive
a favour, came it from the hand of one in power; he was
albeit, a true doglicker, a thorough broken spaniel;
although
it behoves to mention here, that the chronicle
notes there was one brief and momentous period of his
life that Dirk's actions did not adhere so strictly to the
tenets whereon the latter portion of his existence appears
to have been directed, and as if forgetful of his
accustomed
sound policy, in no matter whatever to endanger his
person,whether it was he thought if he escaped the
hazard
the better for his interest, or that he was unawares
drawn in an ebullition of temper, an experiment, from
whose manifest folly he derived much after experience,
in shunning the same rock; he was unadvisedly betrayed
into ire, so far as to run in risk his precious limbs: the
spirit of party at the period alluded to, as usual in the
province, rose uncommonly high, so that a chivalric rage
seized on those who attached themselves to any of the
disputing sides; each man called out his antagonist, and
either with the hand gun, lance, or stave, laid him at his
feet, or lost his own life in the fierce encounter. It so
happened in those irascible days, that Dirk fell foul of
a rough, long shanked, raw boned, giant of a fellow, who
was bullying and ripping out oaths against all that were
of a different mind with himself; in the matter, Dirk,
though fain to retreat, was so entangled that he found
there was no getting clear without a mortal combat;so
with a sad heart, Dirk met his opponent, who having
been a leader of the train bands at Paulus Hook, (in
which latter delightful spot, he was a resident, his
employment
being, with three long limbed, strapping
brothers
,
all fighting bullies like himself, that of a cowfeeder
and grazier on the salt marshes of Pavonia, while his
visits to New-Yorke were for the profitable purpose of
disposing of cheap milk to the households of the prudent
Dutch citizens,) in the affair in question was armed with
a tremendous andrea ferrara, the unexpected sight of
which, so terrified the valorous Dirk, that his legs, for
fear, verily slipt from under him, so that he fell
backwards
towards the earth, which received him unkindly,
for the rearward extremity of his body in his descent
struck with such force the butt end of an old musquetoon,
which had first dropt from his hand, that he bore the
mark of the tender contact ever after, and halted to his
grave; and whether it was from this cause, his limping,
or from the instability of his principles, and the little
dependance
to be placed on his honour or his faith, that the
surname of Van Rikketie was given him is uncertain,
however, taking all things into consideration, it could not
have more truly been applied. With the unsteadiness of
gait that hath been mentioned, though with a face
smirking
with smiles, pleasant and winning, Dirk advancing
made his way past those who intervened between him
and the Governor, overaweing with his superior
effrontery
less barefaced flatterers, and abashing, for very
shame at his extraordinary priority of talent, the host of
his fellow sycophants, who were assembled for similar
purposes, and who were unable to compete with him in
his career of dissimulation, but shrunk in his rear as
humble followers and admirers; though Dirk took the
precedence of every one, yet most courteous was his
progress
,
bowing and grinning to every eye he caught; this
fashion Dirk had learnt from some popular character or
other, finding it took vastly with the greater portion of
the multitude, who, it is well known, are most gratified when
they have it in their power to boast that they are on an
intimate
footing with men in office, that they talked of such
an affair with such a one, the koopman of the stores, who
said so and so, or that they had just received a profound
obeisance
from such a one, the Roymeester, who, of course, is
an extremely fine fellow:nevertheless, Dirk's imitation
of affability was but second hand, praise worthy as it was,
yet as all second hand imitations, it was open to censure,
for there were those who inviduously revenged their
spleen on Dirk's advancement to fortune by terming him
the ape of the worthy, whose manners he had adopted.
Neglecting nothing, however minute, in respect to the
personage to whose notice he was about recommending
himself, Dirk took care, notwithstanding the chill night
air, to uncover his bald head, and thrust his doffed cap
beneath one arm, while the other supported a crowded
bundle of papers, and one or two well bound (in neat calf
covers and with brass clasps) treatises on the laws of the
world, and the honest province of New-Yorke; nor was
Dirk unwise in such display, for he discovered thereby
at once his anxiety, even in the midst of his multitudinous
duties of station, to be among the very first to salute and
tender his adherence to his excellency, and it likewise
showed with what increasing diligence he applied
himself
to the demands of the public, that he could not stir
abroad a moment without bearing with him the fruits of his
application. In truth, Dirk had just been deeply
pondering
,
weighing, and considering on all points a critical case
that he was to decide, and which he had just concluded
on, and was so elated with what he deemed his own
cleverness, or rather, as he supposed, his having as is
vulgarly said `hit the right nail on the head,' in his
making
up his mind, that he could not in his heart separate
himself from the paper whereon he had drawn out his
opinion; indeed he has some little intention, if chance
favored
to sound the Governor on the point, and learn
whether
what he had determined on was acceptable; if not, he
would have time to reverse and accommodate his
sentiments
,
to an accordance with those he found most
popular
.
The thing was this, it happened from Dirk's being
receiver general of the revenues, that all matters of mulct
and penalties, were to be cognizable before him; and
thereby
there came under his especial purview, an examination
wherein one Simon Jantz, a thick headed market boor,
entered
his complaint against a person in office, named
Myndert
Van Schayck, the son of old Levinus Van Schayck, the
public vendu meeter; of the said Van Schayck's having
infamously
tricked him, the said Simon Jantz, and also, of his
having made a purchase with false measures, or rather not
according to the standard, kept for the example of all fair
traders at the public wharf, by the eyckmeester, and like
wise at the pack-huysen, or stores of the colony; now the
latter was an offence, and answerable to fine, while the
former
came out to be, that Myndert having an old negro who
died from very age, and seeking to get rid of the expense
of his burial, hit on an expedient therefor, by going to
the market in Dock-Street, where Jantz had a large
quantity
of eggs for sale, and made a barter to the purpose, that
for as many eggs as he, Van Schayck, could support by
placing his hands close to hips, and stretching out his
fingers, which were by no means small, the eggs as Jantz
understood it, being heaped thereon against his body,
between
his hands as mentioned and his chin, that he Van
Schayck, would sell him the said Jantz, a capital negro
fellow
,
if not without fault, at least without one fault that was
common to any black alive. It happened that the bargain
was artfully brought on, by Van Schayck's leading Jantz to
inveigh against the slaves he possessed, who were an
obstreperous
,
noisy, riotous, drunken set, who wasted every
thing, and who were out night and day, which gave the
other an opportunity to mention he had one he would part
with cheap, who was a sober steady dog, by no means
riotous, wasted nothing, and would never give an insolent
word, say or do what you would, and what was better,
never showed any inclination to stir from any place he
was set. Misled by these recommendations, and
believing
that Van Schayck could not hold many eggs in the
position
agreed on, at the motive for which proposition Jantz
did seriously marvel, the arrangement was gladly made
by the witless churl; who to his surprise at the fulfilment
of the bargain, beheld the wily Van Schayck, seize on two
monstrous baskets, which contained all his eggs, and
making
a place therein to take a firm clinch, by dividing the
rushes
at the bottom, Van Shayck being a stout fellow was able
to raise the baskets to his body, and planting a broad flat
chin, like a horse shoe, on the upper rim of both baskets,
which by this manuvre were brought close together and
steadied, he walked out of the market, leaving the
barterer
thunderstruck at the contrivance, surrounded by gaping
boors, and grinning burghers, and the laughing-stock of
a herd of breechless urchins, who well knowing Van
Schayck, had gathered to see the sport; but this was not
the worst, for no sooner had Myndert deposited his
burden
at his house, which was adjacent to the scene of
action
,
than taking the dead negro, and setting him upright
in one of the baskets he had obtained, and which of course
not having been mentioned in the exchange, he
considered
ought to be returned, he had him conveyed to the
anxious and expecting Jantz, who would not receive him,
but being furious at the deception practised, carried the
matter before a burgomaster, who wisely deeming `a
bargain
,
a bargain, all the world over' decided against Simon,
who thereon was forced to take and bury the negro. But
Jantz being a true obstinate determined character, made
up his mind not to sit under his injuries quietly, but to get
redress if such was to be obtained, and therefore in
conjunction
with one De Witt, an ingenious descendant of the
great pensionary who followed the law, and who was
always
at Jantz's elbow, spiriting him on, he entered an
information
against the vendu meeters son, for buying the
eggs without being measured according to the edicts of
mienheers the burgomasters council on that subject;
thinking by taking this new ground, that he would
effectually
revenge his own wrongs as he was advised, by
means of a public punishment and prosecution,for Jantz
felt like many of his modern prototypes, that it was much
more safe, convenient and certain, under the cloak of an
anxiety for the enforcement of the criminal law, as a good
citizen, to proceed against Van Schayck, wherein the
public
had the benefit of his own impartial testimony, than to
risk the uncertainty of a civil inquest, wherein both sides
were equally admitted to a hearing. Not in the least
adverting
to the subject expressed, whether Van Schayck or
Jantz was right or in error, it is impossible to think without
detestation of the abuses that are practised in the
manner
just mentioned, whereby honest men are at the
mercy of every craven rogue; for what safety is there
for innocencehow little are some men bound where
their feelings are wrought on, where their interest is at
stake, by the sanctity of truth, by that which in the
present
Vol. II. 13
times is but the mock solemnity of an oath; how
much more true justice is there even in the bloody
custom
of the savage, who with the simaugan and tomahawk
as next of kin, pursues the slayer of his tribe with
unceasing
foot to death; the heart of the Indian in such
matters, is not more thirsty for revenge than the white man,
nor is it often that the last is deterred by that which might
sooth the noble and untrained passions of the first; although
civilization boasts of taking the knife from bad men's
handsof allaying the fire of hate by the wholesome
regulations
of social existence, and the difficulties of
attaining
sudden or unmeasured retribution for petty and
insignificant
offences, and of tempering punishment to crime;
yet what doth all amount to, when in reality it but
sanctions
the arts of the designing knavebut affords him the
means of defending himself by legal influence from all attack
to perfect the blackest schemes;he alone being heard, his
adversary kept silent by the unjust barriers of form; the
one unable to assert his defence and probably
provocation
,
while the other sets in motion a hundred engines of
destruction to assist his fell purposes.
As the matter of the eggs was plainly proved, that they
were unmeasured in the basket, Jantz merely meting out a
quantity as he sold them, Dirk Van Rikketie felt himself, as
has been set forth, in a profound quandary; now his doubts
it behoves to mention, arose not so much as to any
obscurity
in the edicts, but rather as to what manner according to
the expressed words of the law, he could reasonably
decide
in favor of the vendu meester's son; for this same
Myndert was an influential character, being son-in-law to
a great man, a burgomaster or some how or the other
very powerful by connexions, so that from the instant
he knew who was concerned as defendant, he, Dirk, was
inclined in his favor, although before he attained such
knowledge, he swore to Jantz, that he would ruin the
losel; however, the decision he prepared amounted
nearly to this; that howbeit it might be penal to sell
without
measuring, yet the edict did not state it so to buy;
therefore this case was not within the meaning of the
law, which Dirk learnedly proved from numerous Dutch
legal authorities, of which he had always a number in
readiness
on all occasions, and for every view he chose to adopt
of the subject under discussion before him; but it is most
grievous to state that this wonderful facultythis
admirable
research possessed by the worthy Dirk, had
begotten
him the sneers of the invidious, who although it was
perfectly well known that Dirk never used any
references
but genuine ones, yet his ill-wishers (and the very
best men have them) went so far as to say, that not one
out of twenty of the decisions which he repeated as
confirmatory
to those made by him, were to be found in the
authors whose names he tacked to them; but to the
question decidedfor among other convincing arguments
to the purport, Dirk remarked, that the whole
procedure
on the part of Myndert, the negro sale, and delivery,
with the manner of getting the eggs was nothing but a
petty fraud, and held out by the custom of merchants; and
the information was therefore dismissed as falsely laid. The
sagacity of this judgment cannot be sufficiently
applauded
,
suffice it, that it has met the admiration and even
adoption of later times.
From all that has been related of Dirk Van Rikketie,
it is not to be wondered at, that Sloughter received a man
of his importance, effrontery and astonishing
acquirements
with at once a degree of pleasure and distinguished
attention, and after a very brief conversation, was fully
convinced that Dirk was a person proper to receive
emoluments and office for his faithful attachment during
all his life to the strongest side; for there was no dark
spot in his character which Dirk was not ready to
palliate
and excuse, in a manner that did him singular honor in
the eyes of his excellency; and as the chronicle records,
Dirk with a fulness of fortune unequalled, not only
under Sloughter, but Ingoldsby, Bellamont and many
succeeding rulers, kept his place, exercising at all times
that judicious courtesy, which went so far to raise him
conspicuous
above those of more common abilities, and which
in the expressive language of the Apostle, made him
all things to all men; yet who would believe the saying
of the ascetic Mienheer Jacobus Kip, is remembered even
in these days before all his virtues, dat besser mens
dan him were hanged.
The interval devoted as is above stated by the
burgomasters
,
to whom it is now full time to return, to recruit
at once body and resolution, having passed, the worthies
with those accompanying, set out to encounter the
bustling
,
jostling and unceremonious elbowing of the motley
crowd that thronged before them; and it was not
without
much pushing and thrusting, motions very grievous
and disagreeable to the portly magistrates, who drew breath
hard from fatigue, and with great entreaty, the exercise of
authoritative demand, and the frequent use of the
burgomasters
wand athwart the bare breech or rough head
of some surly ragamuffin, who took vantage of the
general
confusion to show out in all the pride of native
stubbornness
,
and scarce sooner would stir for a heer than a
fellow-boor, way was at last made, the rather that the
populace recognised the Leislerian partizans, and were
desirous to learn what was to follow, than even for the
dignified appearance of Mienheers Filkins and Gelyn
Verplancke their conductors; for to the latter they were
usually forced to obey and succumb, and therefore
with natural doggedness, delighted in every opposition
however slight to power, in the same spirit that the
rabble
in these days drive in the centinels who are stationed
to keep the crowd back from pressing on a line of
soldiery
on parade; while another impression was made by
the sight of Milbourne and his associates, that excited at
once attention, surprise and curiosity; and instinctively
with eyes rivetted on them, they gave back as they would
were the adverse factionist culprits passing onwards to
trial or to execution.
On arriving within a few paces of Sloughter, Mienheer
Gelyne Verplancke, addressed him, and announced the
apparent object of those he escorted. Heres ish may
id bleaze your axgellenge, said the doughty burgomaster
in a pompous style, such as is used by a herald
proclaiming
the entrance of a knight in the lists, dis mans
Mienheer
Jacobus Milbourne, and dis mans Mienheer Pieter
De Lanoy, and dis mans Mienheer, what der tuyvils hish
name, gome do make a gontract mit your axgellenge mit
beaceand do gongradulade your axgellenge on your
zafe goming do dis gundry mit your gommission, Got zafe
your axgellenge and Mienheer der king.
What seek ye sirs of me, said Sloughter, sternly
casting (while his brows gathered above them) his quick
eyes on the adherents of the man, against whom ill will
was already sown in his heart, as they approached him
as if by his look he would have pierced them through,
what seek ye sirs I say of me, he repeated
We have come Colonel Sloughter, replied De Lanoy
for his companions in a tone of voice mild yet firm, `to
bear from your own lips, how far the unfortunate differences
that hath subsisted in this unhappy country can be settled
to learn your feelings towards ourselves and friends
whom we have been taught to believe, you suppose the
aggressors against their majesties' will; in such supposition
Sir, I must be permitted to tell you, you have been
misled
,
grossly misledfor although twice to your demands
have the fort's gates been closedthough twice this night
we have refused you entrance therein or submission, can
you if you are a reflective man condemn; you are a
strangeryour whole procedure since your first
landing
in the province hath been a questionable one, and
even now we are unconvinced by what authority you
have proceeded, to take the name and right of governor
of this land;and for this too have we sought you Sir,
that you may as in reason and in truth you are strictly
bound, give us satisfaction on this head, and exhibit to us
the sanction that you boast of his majesty king William,
of whom we as well as yourself, profess to be loyal and
liege subjects; and this we request you to do forthwith,
as if such be the case that your commission is genuine, it
would indeed be wrong for us to oppose your will, but if
otherwise as in duty he is bound, Jacob Leisler will spend
the last blood drop in his heart, ere he yields one stone
up to your possession.
Sloughter hesitated a moment ere he answered,
apparently
as if he debated whether he should speak or not,
or at once break the conference: significant looks, as the
13*
countenance of the governor darkened, passed between the
bystanders, and the withered features of Edsell, as he
listened and gazed on the ominous expression of
Sloughter's
visage, lightened with a half suppressed smile of
triumph.
Ye have come late to question sirs, quoth
Sloughter
cold and sneeringly, and judging from your modest
demands, ye are conquerors and we the craven bondsmen,
made by your doughty lance and bow.
It may be that we are not the first to greet you Col.
Sloughter, abrupt and warm broke in the voice of
Milbourne
,
his quick feelings stung by the Governor's manner,
but lack that service.As good protestants, are we to cry
cap in hand to every vagabond, who sets up the staff and
claims sovereignty. Who vouches for every man, that
may take mind to impose on public credulity?No, Sir,
Jacob Leisler called to the high office he exercises, by
the voice of this colony, sees not fit to lay down the
investure
,
without knowing well to whom he resigns his
powers,shall he take any man's say so?rather I think
it would have become one bearing an undisputed title to
govern this land, to have sought the Lieutenant
Governor
,
and exhibited to him his document and seal, than to
have skulked in the hiding places of the disaffected, and
the fastnesses of lurking rebels, sucking in the
malignant
fables of such who envious and revengeful, sought to
heat his breast to equal hatred with their own, and it would
seem he was not loth, but like the wolf lapping blood,
eagerly feasted on the banquet of scandal.I am a bold
plain-spoken man, Col. Sloughter, and wither my tongue
when I speak not what I feel; your present reception of us,
your conduct confirms, nay your own breast may answer,
to the truth of what I have said; and were it the last word I
shall ever breathe, I would repeat you have not dealt
openly
with us.
As he listened to this rash speech, the eyes of
Sloughter glared like balls of fire upon the headstrong
speaker, and he bit his nether lip in anger, till the blood
and froth that hung upon it mingled, but yet keeping
down his ire for awhile, he heard him through, nor
offered
to interrupt him, while those who stood beside
Sloughter
,
and read the signal for their motions, in the index of
their master's countenance, awaited with anxious
expectation
in readiness to execute the stern mandates, which it
was likely he would give, and denounced the fate of the
son-in-law of Leisler, and his followers in their hearts.
Then I read ye aright Sirs, said the Governor with
an assumed calmness of utterance, ye have come hither
to rate me, as ye would some arrant school boy for
disobedience
;
forsooth I sought not this Leisler, and in
humble
guise waited his leisure to receive and acknowledge
me, or rather till he chose to use me as his passive
instrument
,
to forward his vilo ambition? 'Tis well Sirs,
'tis mighty welland possibly I should have had the
benefit of your sober guidance and experience, and I wot
not what else honors I might have attained. Good Sirs, I do
confess me, that in my joining with these men around, I
have done most wrong, acted most criminal, albeit you
having
so high a claim on my first attention, natheless it is not
late to repent, or make you reparation therefor.It
shall be done, and you shall have leisure to examine my
commission: But dogs continued he, changing the
ironical
tone in which he had spoken to one loud and fierce,
it shall be in the dank dungeon; fools, that ye arewhat
think ye of me, that ye beard me thus, that ye brave me
as it were in the very pitch of my power? wot ye not it
is dangerous to tamper with the javelin's sharp point, that
it is death to press the poison bag of the serpent;out on
ye, for besotted blinded knaves, whose madness hath
endangered
your necksho! there master Mayor, where
are your lackies, added he turning to Van Kortlandt,
let them take these fellows and clap them in close
custody
,
the crime is high treason, that is charged against
them, and an your hounds look not to their watch Master
Mayor, peril my head, but they will be like to ride a
worse horse than the wooden one.
Van Kortlandt joyous and eager as he received the
Governor's intimation, beckoned the guard who attended
him by virtue of his office of mayor of the city; for in
his old dignity he had been speedily re-installed, the friend
of Leisler, who had for awhile fulfilled the duties of the
station, having taken refuge in the fort; the soldiers
hastily
advanced at the sign.
Beware sir, ere you enter on the risk you have
commanded
,
pause Colonel Sloughter, ere you commit a crime
black and infamous, hastily ejaculated De Lanoy, a
crime that will damn your memory for ever, a crime against
all faith, adverse to honour and the laws of nations; you
have forgotten sir, the character we have came hither in,
the envoy, no matter what his offence, is sacred from all
hurt; the vilest barbarian that ever lived, respected such
as sought him in that garb. There is no excuse for
wanton
aggression on that sacred and holy bond of virtue, that
hath bound nations at war; the sword's point sinks to the
earth before the white flag; dismiss us therefore
unharmed
,
since you will not hear our offers or treat with us; as a
man, as a soldier, it is your duty to give us safe conduct to
our friends.
There was a moment's silence after De Lanoy ceased,
ere answer was returned, and when the pause was broken,
other lips than Sloughter's gave reply.
Ye waste words on idle air, quoth Edsell as if glad of
the chance to vent his malevolence, the Governor will
not condescend to speak further with traitors, yet to
relieve
you on the head of faith, I answer, that the customs
which are extended between belligerent powers, are of
non-effect, when applied to committers of treason,you
are not here recognised as aught but rebels in arms against
the commissioned servant of their majesties; the lawless
keepers, probably the murtherers also, of two
distinguished
and worthy burghers of this province, Colonel Nicholas
Bayard and Walter Nichols, and so ye are attainted; so
preach ye not sirs, of law or virtue, but bethink ye of
atonement, for the high misdemeanours laid at your charge.
Burghers, addded he to the guards forward, it is the
Governor's pleasure that these knaves be disarmed, and
bound neck and heels.
From the lips of several hundred bystanders, rose a
terrific shout of triumph, long hollow and dreadful, that
echoed in the midnight, like the burst of a tornado, as in
an instant De Lanoy, who stood more unguarded than his
companions, was overpowered and stript of the weapons
of defence, that he had in vain strove to use with effect;
but though he was borne down in strength and arms, yet
he was not so in spirit, for his soul was roused to
its utmost by Sloughter's conduct, and like the
chained
mastiff raving with anger, and thirsting for revenge,
he could have bit in twain the rude bonds wherewith he
was hastily girt;the conquest however of his companions
was not so easily accomplished, for being alert and aware
of the danger that approached, the buccaneer shook off
with a sudden jerk, the hand of the soldier that was first
placed on his garb, and seizing the momentary
opportunity
so afforded, by a spring he freed himself from the
presssing
throng, that encompassed him, and made his way to the
stoel of the stad-huis, where planting himself firmly against
the wall, he fronted his foes with stern visage and levelled
handgun, which from his elevation on the step, had a
fair sweep for effect.
At the same time, nearly simultaneous with the action of
his bold follower, Milbourne taking advantage of the
fluctuation
of the crowd caused by Eumet's unexpected
movement, tore from the man who advanced nearest upon
him, the heavy partisan with which the soldier was
armed, and hurling its weight before his step, forced
from the path those who immediately pressed upon him,
and dashing with sudden force through the opening thus
made, he cleared the space that was between, and
seeking
the same object, stood in an instant at the rover's side.
Santo Espirito! ye hungry Dutch sharks, roared
Eumet with a voice shrill and dissonant; an ye press
me so stoutly, your gunwales shall such blood, carja!
thof I go by the boardvoto a madre de dios, more than
one pilot o' ye shall heave the same lead 'fore I touch
bottom
:and
as he spoke, he pointed the arquebuse among
the throng of his enemies. It is a true remark, that there
are but few things of more effect for the brief moment,
even on a wild, enraged and confident assemblage, than a
determined bearing on the part of the weak and attacked,
showing the desperate formed resolution of selling life at
its dearest rate; such as the swelling breast of
Milbourne
and his flashing eye indicated to be the decision he
had made; added to this was the reckless and fearless
ferocity of his companion, who, accustomed to bear down
odds by boldness, and to woo death in every shape, scarce
reflected on what must be the positive end of such
unequal
battle.
The courage and spirit of the pirate of the time is too
well known to descant on. Careless of numbers or
dangers that it would seem madness to brave, these men
fought in their daring adventures with a fury and success
truly wonderful, and with a fierce hardihood and strength
that overcame every thing before thementering in spite
of their defences, rifling and sacking with sword and
flame fortified towns and guarded places, defying in their
search for booty, as it were, all mortal powerbraving
storm and ball, climbing from their low and sinking barks
the main chains, and sweeping from all opposers the
decks of the tallest ships, careless, like devils incarnate,
of fire or steel,were their daily habits. In such actions
and frequent conflicts had Eumet been inured to every
stress; therefore, although to both their desolate
situation
and hopelessness of escape were apparent, yet with
grim frowns they gazed upon their foes, and neither as
they looked did a cheek blanch, or a limb tremble; but,
with the front of entoiled lions, they stood undaunted
and unmoved.
Those who have pursued with unrelenting and unabated
heat the rapid and timorous flight of the chase, when
they meet the furious animal at his last struggle, give
back in wonder at the creature's mad desperation, and
hesitate ere they brave his death thrall; even so was it
now with the throng; the threatening attitudes and ready
weapons of Milbourne and Eumet had their brief effect;
for amid the wildest and unrestrained rabble there are
few so rash as it were, to be the first to commence violence
and throw away their lives, for the gratification of their
companions. Though, indeed, after the first blood is spilt
there are none who will withhold their hands from the
slaughter, yet there are seldom those who delight in
yielding themselves as the first victims: still, the smallest
incident was sufficient to free them from restraint, and to
unbridle to the utmost the sanguinary tempers of the
burghers; yet they felt the slight advantage of the station
ofthe others, and even the clamour and cries for death, with
which all hearing for awhile had been drowned, sunk so
low for a moment as the buccaneer glanced his quick,
sharp eye around to search him out an object for his
ball, that his wild cry and hoarse shout of defiance rang
high above the uproar of his adversaries.
Ha! that voice is not young in my hearing, nor do I
see that face for the first time; cried Sloughter,
animatedly
,
his peculiar attention drawn to the marauder
by the loud, fierce utterance of his braggart threats, and
the hesitation of the crowd; and recognising the ruffian
mate of Kid and one of his late persecutors
murthering
dog! is it thee,pirate, robber,yield thy forfeit
body to the law.
Base, treacherous hound! answered Milbourne to
Sloughter's cry, shaking aloft the halbert with which he
was armed;we spit at thee, and spurn thy orders as
we would thy neck beneath our feet; for cursed be this
hand of minepalsied, I say be it, ere I crouch to word
of thine: thou mayst triumph, cur, but it shall be when
Jacob Milbourne can neither hear nor see thy smile of
conquest.
The rumour of what was passing in front of the
stadt-huis
seemed to have spread abroad with astonishing
velocity
,
and from great distances every one that could bear
themselves, uncrippled by age or disease, had hurried along
in bands to that quarter. The populace had now collected
in a promiscuous crowd on the slip, amounting to several
hundreds, and were incessantly increasing by new arrivals,
each one seeking the spot, desirous of bearing a part in
the scene about enacting, or urged by curiosity as well as
interest, strove to thrust themselves forward in the throng.
The mob momently grew closer wedged, those behind
pressing to get in advance, scarce suffering the persons in
front to bear back a step from the ground whereon they
stood; as the numbers enlarged, the more deep and
vehement
were the muttered menaces that passed from their
lips, which were fast growing to cries of hatred and
inveteracy
,
that were now strengthened by the brave
uspect of the factionists; and with fierce looks like the
mastiff that has been driven back in his first attempt on the
baited bull, they gazed on their devoted foemen.
The narrow windows of the Dutch houses, the roofs
of buildings, and the masts of the yatchen became
places for spectators, and were filled with people,
who with clamorous outcries and savage gesticulations,
urged those below and within hearing of their words
to the commission of outrage, which they, from their
situations, to participate in were unable. The
intimidation
caused by the gallant front borne by Milbourne and
Eumet was but momentary, and to such fearful height had
the feeling of the burghers arisen, that during the brief
yet fierce passage of invective between the parties above
detailed, their speech could scarce be heard above the
terrific imprecations that filled the air; and at the very
moment the bold voice of Milbourne was exerted to its
stretch in proud defiance, he had but closed the
utterance
of his determination to die ere he would submit,
when there was hurled from some powerful yet unknown
hand from among the crowd, a missile, weighty and sharp
as the head of some javelin; its aim was certain and it
had been sent with care; with tremendous force, that gave
back a sound, hollow and fearful, it struck the
unprotected
bosom of the unfortunate partizan of Leisler; as he
felt the blow, he sprang upwards in the air a foot or more,
while the halbert that he held dropt from his loosened
grasp, and he flung his arms out with a motion like the
swimmer; at the same moment, there gushed in a stream,
blood, thick and dark, from both mouth and nostril, while
with a last long faint and smothered shriek of bitter agony,
he tottered and sank upon his face; as he lay upon the
ground, there ran through his limbs a slight shivering like
one that is touched with sudden chillness of blood, and
then the fierce Milbourne lay motionless. No sight had
beheld from whose hand death had been given; yet it was
marked that the direction from whence the missile came
was that whereat Edsell stood, and it is said that his aged
features when his enemy dropt down, wore a grim smile of
joy, but that it flitted in an instant, leaving no trace upon
his visage; and although his hand trembled with age and
there was apparently too little vigor in his old arm to
give so fatal a blow, in after times when men's minds
were changed, and the hot zeal that now heated them
with blind rage, was cooled and passed away, he was not
seen, even till the day of his death,but dark whispers
and hints were dropped among such as looked on him;
few held communion with him; he lived a solitary life,
and died, it is reported, though stricken as he was in years,
by his own hands. Panic and consternation at the deed
for an instant overwhelmed the crowd; surprise at the
length to which their own audacity had carried matters
was succeeded by a doubting and sullen silence; but this
was not to last;Eumet saw his associate fall, and
expecting
the next moment to share his fate, hastily discharged
his arquebuse with deadly effect amidst those nearest him;
the ball buried itself in the breast of a burgher, who
rolled
with a piercing groan, weltering in his heart's blood,
at the feet of his companions; those who stood by uttered
a cry of sorrow, and as they beheld the blood that had
spirted upon their garments, the relenting feeling that had
possessed their hearts at Milbourne's fall was
extinguished
and a yell of rage and vengeance burst from every lip,
in one wild outcry, terrible as that with which the tigress
mourns its young;the former fury of the multitude
redoubled
;
a hundred pikes and clubs were extended to
satiate
the thirst of their hearts; shrieks, groans and hisses
of execration filled the air; with merciless power the
weapons
of the pirate were rent from his hands, and he himself
felled upon the ground beside the senseless form of
Milbourne
;
not one but a hundred hands had stricken him
downthe passions of the infuriated crowd now knew no
boundsthe voice of the governor was unheard amid
the uproar; in vain were endeavours to quell the riot;
the destitute and defenceless state of the objects of their
hate availed not to satisfy them; no single voice of
expostulation
could rise amidst the storm; at one moment a
hundred hands had grasped the bodies of the fallen
adherents
Vol. II. 14
of Leisler, while numbers, unsatisfied, fought to
attain the hold from those who had seized on the
inanimate
victims; with tumultuous screams, with horrid
exultation
the disfigured trunks were dragged along the earth,
and pulled to and fro, and dashed, with wanton brutality,
on every side; handsful of mud and dirt were cast upon
them; on the bruised limbs heartless blows were
showered
,
and fierce feet trampled them down; soon was every
shred of garb that covered the mangled flesh torn in rags,
and the breathless corses looked not of humanity, but
rather
shapeless and disgusting masses of filth and gore, for
which numerous madmen were contending; it was not
long ere the trembling limbs were torn apart and hurled
in the air while yet palpitating with life, and as though
they were priceless, the livid and discoloured remains
were caught up by the struggling populace as they fell
among them, who followed every new act of savage
cruelty
with hoarse shouts of applause and gratification; like
the wild dogs who battle over the bodies of the slain for
a mouthful, they snatched from hand to hand bits of
flesh that they stripped from the bones, reeking with
gouts of blood, and he that could obtain a strip of skin,
peeled from the scalp with the hair yet clinging to it, or
a piece of flesh, however small, to hang upon the end of
his pike, gloried as in a deed of praise. In a very short
time almost every particle of the dead had suffered such
division, and was borne aloft upon the weapons of the
throng as trophies of triumph, while alone here and there,
scattered upon the earth were deep thick pools of blood,
or beside some stone, unregarded, yet clung a shred of
brain that had stuck there when the corse had been
dragged
away. Suddenly, as when a wind changes on the
sea, and takes the current in a different course from that
in which late it had flowed, a new idea took possession
of the minds of the brutal populace; a cry was heard
among them that gathered strength as it went, and with
gestures of menace, and fearful clamours they pointed
towards
the fort, and in an instant to that direction the
whole crowd turned and poured forward, like a host of
mountainous waves rolling up the beach, bearing in front
of their path, upon two pikes, the torn and mangled heads
of Milbourne and Eumet: the gory visages presented a
horrible and ghastly spectacle, as the quick lights of the
flambeaux flashed upon them; no eye could recognise the
pallid and convulsed features: the skull of one was clove
asunder, and the scalp hung loose and lacerated; the
eyes of the other had been rent from their sockets as
though plucked out by the beak of a raven, and the
lower jaw was torn from its seat; with such terrific
ensigns did they march)onward they went, waving
the bleeding trunks on high with malicious triumph.All
was tumult and commotion in their way, and their tread
sounded louder than the lashing of the angry surfagainst an
iron-bound coast. Many with fearful yells joined in the
train of the frantic mob, while others terror struck, fled
their path; and there were women and wailing children,
with pale looks and dishevelled hair, that with wandering
eyes and beating hearts, gazed forth upon the rout, as
the horrid uproar assailed their ears, startling the sweet
visitation of sleep from their night couches, and filling
their astonished bosoms with consternation and with
awe. The fate of their embassy however, reached
Leisler and his confederates, together with a warning of
the approach of the enraged populace, before they gained
the gates of the fort: as the murmurs of their coming
indistinct and doubtful like the gathering of an army, were
heard, terror and horror blanched the boldest cheek,
and for awhile, struck powerless every listener of the
tragedy;each held his breath, like the stag, driven in
some dell that is girt round with woods and hath no outlet
but the entrance, and indecisive and despairing, they gazed
one ach other; then as of one accord, there rose from every
lip a wild outcry of sorrow and of mourning; some stood
like frozen statues unmoved, to await the death they
could not fly;others beat their breast in agony, and
strewed their hair with dust, in womanish affright.
Soon brief and fearful was the debate they held;the
alarm of the coming host was already giventhe
imminent
danger was at the pressthe outcries of
relentless
foes were borne upon the night, and with their
slender force it appeared madness to contend; and ere
the throng had thundered on the oaken gates for
admittance
,
Leisler and his companions had sought such safety
as flight could yield; and when the doors crashed beneath
their blows and fell inwards in splintered atoms,
the blood-thirsty mob found as they took possession,
(though they sought with savage eagerness in every
suspected
hiding place for food to prey upon,) no living man
whereon to glut their deadly appetite for death and
slaughter
.
And yet though safe from the butchering hands of the
lawless burghersthough he heard far behind him their
cries sink in distance, yet his footsteps were tracked, and
the life of Jacob Leisler was spared but for wo and
mourning, for the next dawn rose on him a deserted and
solitary captive, in the prison-house of his fierce and
unsparing enemies.
BOOK THE FOURTH.
THE FATAL BANQUET.
SECTION I.
And then what bribes may do
In hastening execution, do but consider.
This very age hath given
Horrid examples lately.
T. May
.
The
intentions of a writer, as to the peculiar fashion
which at setting out, and in the incipient stages of his
labour, he may have adopted to develope his ideas and
bring forward the various incidents of his work, are
more than once frustrated, if not entirely defeated, as he
progresses thereinlike a person raising an edifice for
his own residence, and who, when he lays the foundation
of the building, stoutly determines on going to no more
than a certain moderate expenditure, which he then
calculates
as equal to the uttermost parts of his
undertaking
,
and therefore he resolves to remain unvarying
by the original plan laid and approved on for the
structure
;
yet in spite of such determination, long ere the
dwelling is under roof, unconsciously, he has proceeded
to place innumerable additional comforts to his first
design
,
whose necessity hath become apparent as the
fabric
grew under his sight and care, so that long before
the whole is completed, he finds it difficult to recognize
a feature of his first design, and is surprised that unawares
he should have been so widely led astray from the mark
14*
which he had placed as his boundary. Even with a
feeling akin to this, is this one of the last books of this
erratic
narrative commencedfor when I look back to the
matter already concluded, there is to be found, it must be
confessed, not much that follows the early conception; and
a wonder arises, how the limits, fixed as impassable on
the rude threshold of the plot, at its dawn have been so
strangely, and perhaps unadvisedly, overstepped. Yet so
it is; at commencing, a plain straight forward route had
been penciled, from which it appeared as if there could
be no departure; but the following was clear and
without
an obstacle; still, numberless times has this high
road been wandered from, seemingly almost without the
slightest reason; matters that one scarcely thought of
treating on, have crowded themselves on the canvass;
characters whom it was proper to have kept in the back
ground, but for occasional use, have taken up the
principal
portion of the picture; and in many places more
hath been done, and in others, much less than could
have been wished; and so it is, that now I am fully
aware that there is enough to do in accomplishing the
most critical point of my task, I mean the putting a last
finishthe smoothing of rough ends, and making whole
all broken shreds and the like, caused by such rash
procedure
in the work, which may now be resembled not
unaptly, to some gallant bark with rent canvass and torn
tackling dangling in the wind, after the wild tempest
hath swept over her.
And who is to blame except yourself, for the trouble
you may anticipatefor might not even more difficulties
than there are in reality, have been expected, and with
good cause, from the manner which without rhyme,
reason, or any advice whatsoever, you have headstrong
pursued in the developement of the facts of this strange
history? methinks some sour tongued and scowling
reader
,
who intends to play the critic adverse and morose,
exclaims, while he peevishly turns over the leaves,
having
looked at them with a stern resolve to be displeased
and find fault, and now eagerly snaps at an opportunity,
hat his ire may have vent, was it not, quoths he in
continuance, to be supposed that such would be the
event, when whole pages have been dragged out with
drawling insipidities, which, with perverse obstinacy,
the inditer misconceives, misled with affectation and
conceit
,
thinking them excellent witticismshe therefore
presumes they are advantageous to the world, and beget
a favourable opinion of the profoundness of his
reflections
,
and his views of mankindand under this gross
mistake, the whole force of his story, if he has any, has
been destroyed by abrupt departures from its interest, to
thrust on the impatient ear of the peruser, spiteful
complaints
against the fashion of existing manners; doubtless
all this may appear to him wondrous wise as well as
censorious, but he should remember that it has been
remarked
,
with some truth, that many writers have
supposed
themselves very deep, when they were most
superficial
;
and forsooth, what entitles him to decry every
body and every thing, that comes within the range of his
pen? does this self constituted guardian of morals,
believe
himself more pure than his fellows, or does he
suppose he renders himself the more conspicuous and
worthy of public attention by such unmeasured attacks?
If so, he is widely in errorfor take my word for it, and
it is seldom I mistake, that he is presumptuous, in
undertaking
to weary the reader with his sarcastic remarks on
human frailtyfor who takes up a book but for an hour's
amusement, to wile away the ennui of the day, that
hangs heavy on his hands? and there is not one of a
thousand, who may look into these pages, if they have
the fortune to have so many readers, who care one atom
what is of evil or good effect in society; for of a surety,
each one in these hard times, has sufficient to attend to
his own concerns, without the trouble of such matters;
for there are few proverbs truer than the one which
teaches, that which is the business of all, is no one's
affair
;
and who is such a fool as to think of any one
except
himself, now-a-days? Philanthropy is a good
standing
subject for conversation, but its practice is entirely
out of the questionfor it is the modern maxim of
wisdom
,
that each one use his fellow for his own interest,
and get all he can from him, and then trample the
victim
,
or rather idol, who hath submitted to the purposes
of cunning that were worked on him, in the dust without
remorse: truly our lovers of mankind are men of sense;
there is nothing which comes in their way, but they
derive
benefit from
And out o' th' richest fruit
With thirsty lips, draw forth its blood, its juice,
Its ripeness, and its very life; and then,
Like some noxious herb, the flagged and empty
Skins, do cast aside for swine to revel on.
But even for the sake of argument, master author,
admitting
your motives are good, what substantial
influence
do you believe your railing will tend to have on the
conduct of the world? you are very vain an you suppose
it will better it one jot. Your experiment is not new
it has been tried by better men heretofore, and what
avails itnot the tythe of a hair; and I repeat to you,
it is your part to learn wisdom, you must submit as others
have done, to circumstances, which are not in the power
of any mortal to control, or in the least to restrict
things will be even as they arenot a giant's hand were
it to sweep and strew death like the poisonous blast of an
eastern samul, above the congregated herds of sharpers,
rogues, and villains that infest, or rather flourish in
society
,
could succeed in driving vice from the human
mind: for ere its task were more than begun, it would
tire and give over in despair at the vain attempt; for
like the ranks of some numerous army, as one squadron
bites the dust from adverse ball and steel, new files
succeed
,
closing each vacant space as though such had
never
beeneven so, to every knave who repents or gives
up business, there are a dozen successors ready to take
the ground he leaves, and improve on his knaveries. So
peace, sapient sir, for you are biting like a madman doth
his chain, your teeth meet irontherefore desist in time,
and give us the fate of Leisler at once, without such
preludes
a
continuance of which there is in your manner an
augury.
As a very oracle and with truth, I must admit,
sagacious
disciple of Longinus, hast thou spoken; and as I
give ear to your discourse, greatly am I inclined to adopt
your last advice. Yet there clings to me a few words
which I beg your patience on, as perforce they conquer
every resolution that I form to restrain them, and will
forth; and whether they refute your remarks, you must
judge.
Nay, hold for mercy's sake, master author, I yawn
already
at the thought of the vituperation that is gathering
around your pen and standish. I will allow all you are
going to say as truthit is the best way to get rid of
your incorrigible sophismsfor you have an answer at all
times; yet I will say assuredly your pictures are many
times the very copies of nature. But have pity on
yourself
if not on me; remember the famous Annibal
Caracci
beheld his noblest works despised, neglected, and
discountenanced, for no other cause than that they were
faithful portraitures of creation, while his pupils Guido
and Carravagio succeeded, by following the advice given in
their master's despondency, of outraging all they attempted
to represent, to please the taste and whims of their
patrons
.
And let me inquire what painter would be so mad,
so envious, of losing every customer and admirer, as to
draw the pimples on the nose of a debauchee, or the
freckles on the cheeks of some would-be beauty, or
deliver
himself up to the eternal enmity, and tea-table
scandal
of some antiquated dame, whose finer feelings he has
wounded, by placing every line of age, even to the
bristles
on the chin upon his canvass; and what would become
of the fairest specimens of his skill, the lines on which he
labored in expectation of fame for whole hours, for days,
while light could guide his pencilthe garret dust and
decay
would be their lot, while the unfortunate artist would
of course, meet contempt and starvation; so be warned.
Nay, wise sir, you know me not, if you suppose the course
I might care to undertake, was one from which I am
easily
frightened, or that a moment's concern would be felt
by me, from what might be said by the self appointed, and
undisputed judges of literature, the magnates of the day,
who suspect in their own belief, that when they have
indited
an unread paragraph, increasing the native
dullness
of some leaden journal, or after they have
contributed
to render the pages of some abortive review yet more
stupid, by the barren efforts of their paltry brains, that they
have done that which has called towards themselves, the
sole attention of the world; and are installed as the
arbiters
of public opinion, and have thereby a licence to run
down their betters, as well as to be the leaders in
societies
of arts or sciences, in which they are ignorant. In
truth it is amusing to behold the freaks of such
contemptible
things, who infest the walks of literature; with what
brazen assurance they push themselves forward,
unmindful
of their senseless and empty heads. Here are a host of
them, directors of a national or city institution, for the
encouragement
or exhibition of the works of the followers of
Raphael and Vandyke, not one of whom ever held a brush or
pencil in their hands, nor are equal scarcely to judge the
difference
between a master-piece of Rubens' and a
publican's
sign; there are others of the same class, if not the
self same personages, (for a pretension to universal
knowledge
is the fashion) lecturing, and delivering discourses
on every species of learning, and philosophy, to
simpering
and delighted things who term themselves the
patterns
of fashionthe aristocracy of the day; who listen with
the same advantage and instruction to the unnatural
squallings of a foreign charlatan, in a tongue that not one
out of a hundred of them understands; although it would be
ungenteel to acknowledge their ignorance, and they
therefore
pretend delight,as well as to the motley undigested,
unformed nonsense, the skimmings of insignificance, that
hovers on the lips of some conceited ape called a
professor
of
what truly except of vanity, it is hard to
determine
,
unless a pair of spectacles or some such foppery, to
assist youthful eyes, entitles one to the station, in spite of
the manners of a coxcomb and the stupidity of an ass.
And it is these, and such as these, who upheld by self
sufficiency
,
and an unquenchable thirst for notoriety, render
ludicrous and contemptible, the associations whose
ostensible
object should be that of improvement, but which are
made subservient to the private ends of needy
adventurers
,
or to show off the sterile intellect and conceit of
some undaunted pretender, envious of having his name in
print; so it matters not what branch of knowledge,
however
abstruse or foreign from his own calling, in which he
mingles;even the meetings of horticulturists are
crowded
with psuedo physicians, flippant lawyers, paltry
merchants
,
and presuming conductors of heavy journals, a
varied group among whom it is a chance if there is one
who knows the difference between a spade or a rake, an
artichoke or a cabbage; and whose only object in usurping
characters, the qualifications for which they are by no
means acquainted with, is a greedy avarice of public
attention, which is apparently the more powerful in the
human mind, the more narrow and confined the
intellect
;
for it is remarkable, folly believes itself the more
admired
and akin to wisdom, the more it is exposed. Yet
though this be known and acknowledged, the evil has a
certain influence, and so preposterous is the mania, that
to secure the success of some new invention, the
mechanic
or manufacturer deems it prudent to propitiate the
recommendation of these leaders of opinion: for the crowd,
brow-beaten by their haughty airs of superiority, have
silently endured their arbitrary dictation; while it is
common to rely on, and boast of the certificate of its
usefulness and perfection, from some noisy divine,
or shallow votary of Galen, ere the universal adoption
of a new discovery, whether it be for the sawing of logs,
the making of nails or pins, or the curing of a smoky
chimney; nevertheless, this absurdity might not call for
reprobation, were the actors guided in the least by
principle
or disinterestednessbut it is in most instances too
palpable, that if by accident they serve the public
essentially
,
they have intended but to feed their avarice or
their vanity, without the slightest regard for social or
moral duty; nay, without the least sense of that
obligation
which man owes to his fellow or his Maker; and
however worthless the objects of those passports of
public patronagehowever false, paltry or insignificant,
their intrinsic composition, the easier is it to obtain
advecates
,no
quackery, be it ever so wretched and liable to
detection, if the proper methods be taken by securing the
selfish praise of some petty and venal press, but may be
eminently successful in its impositionand this latter,
the press, is the most subservient tool in being at the
timeready to serve the purposes of any one, without
the least deference as to the honour, honesty, or the
licentiousness of the cause it espouses, according to the
directions of the master of those who conduct it: with
the vilest inconsistency, it is ready to defame or laud any
man or measureand however steady for a day it may
appear, however firm and determined its course for an
hour, yet, like the grave looking demagogue of Athens,
who roared in every assembly of the people against the
increasing power of the Macedonian, the sooner it may
be looked for to change its sentimentsthe sooner it will
be corruptedfor like some starved hound, gazing at
other dogs revelling in an enclosure in which it is unable
to break on the kitchen offals, the more envious it is
the more hungry its mawthe fiercer its barkingbut
like the quadruped, it is but desirous of a bone to stop
its mouth;and so is it with all, no matter what the
degree
,
or the station, all are for sale, all are to be bought;
and of too much truth is the line of the Roman orator,
Fit enim deterior qui accipit atque ad idem semper
expectandem
paratior.And although fortune may be
likened to a fickle courtesan, yet like such, her love and
favours are for the highest bidder, without respect to
qualifications or worth; and though many times accident
or caprice may raise the most unfit to stations whereto
their stupidity folly and vice gives disgrace,still, too
often bribery is the only stepping stone to elevation
and office. Indeed from the prevalent spirit of the day,
one is led unawares into a reflection many times, similar
to that treated on by Machiavel, in the first book of his
Discourses, whether, when the people have grown
corrupt
,
a free government can be maintained, if they enjoy
it, and which he concludes is impossibleand that a
corrupt people, whom moderate laws cannot correct,
can only be restrained and bound, by enforcing severe
edicts by arbitrary power.
Day awoke with heavy, languid and wintry light,
above the scene of the late tumult, and calm seemed o'er
the city succeeding the tempest, that, but a short time
before, had shook with alarm to its most distant quarters;
the usual hour, when the busy and stirring citizen
crowded
the streets, had passed; an uncommon silence and
desertion pervaded, even in the places often most
frequented
;
the mechanic and the labourer, though at the
first breaking of the dawn, they had sprang from their
pallets and hastily attired themselves as wont, yet paused
ere they went forth unto their daily toils of life, in strange
and timid uncertainty; it appeared as if a feeling of
conscious
guilt hung over all, and each man feared to gaze
upon his neighbour, lest in the countenance he looked on,
he should read the detestation and horror painted in his
own heart; with stealthy pace, and uneasy mind, the
burgher stole forthand here and there as the hours
journeyed on, at some remote spots in the city, were
gathered small and anxious groups, among whom,
discourse
on the events of the past night was busy, and
was carried on in low and fearful whispers; the rashness
that had been displayed, was commented on, and an
indefinite
terror filled the breasts of those who listened to
the relations of the fray which was varied by every
narrator
,
of what would succeed, or in what manner the
massacre of Milbourne and the others, might be viewed;
rumours and tales, disjointed and mutilated, were on
every lipwhile those who, either more courageous or
inquisitive than their fellows, had ventured earlier to
approach
the front of the Stadthuis, which had been the
chief scene of the bloody drama, and had lingered to
examine the lacerated and torn strips of flesh strewed
around, that had been but awhile before a portion of a
human body, and which, though trodden in the mud and
snow, were easily distinguished by spots of blood frozen
by the morning air, and were handled with a revolting
Vol. II. 15
touch, had returned, and brought with them accounts of
the cruel butchery that had been committed, that made
the hearts of those who questioned thereon, thrill with
horror and wonder, at the extent of rage to which they
had been transported: suspense, as well as inquietude,
now followed, and for a time prevailed over the mind of
each apprehensive citizen; for that day, a change
appeared
to have been made in the ordinary habits of the
city; customary occupations and pursuits were
abandoned
;
few stalls of trade were opened; the bosoms of
men struggled between fear and hope, and those who
remained not in the solitude of their houses in mournful
rumination, sought out their neighbours, to communicate
with them on all the night had witnessed, and to
deprecate
the event; but this lasted not longas the day wore
onwards, the signal of the city bell announced the
arrival
of the hour at which the magistrates were used to
hold their sittings for the committal and punishment of
ordinary offenders, and for the conservation of the city's
peace, summarily award the wooden horse, the cucking
stool, the gallows, the transport ship, or the stake. At
the sound, as if moved by one impulse, every step
sought the Stadthuys, and every inquiring eye was bent
towards its walls; and though there might have been
some, who on their way thither, trod reckless by the
stains of crime and death that lay in their path, yet more
than one involuntarily shuddered at the sight as he hurried
past, and it was not long, ere a vast multitude of anxious
burghers had thronged within the portals of the building,
or with troubled visages strove for entrance from the steps
of the stoeb. And the planks laid across the ditch or
schroeinge, in front of the Stadthuys, were filled with
those who endeavoured, by frequent calls on the more
fortunate in advance of their position, to learn such
information as might be obtained from the burgomasters.
Mention hath been heretofore made of the
structure
,
within which the incidents of the narrative are
about to lead; nevertheless a peculiar description
of its outward appearance will not here be deemed
out of place, nor uninteresting to readers of an age
so famed for improvements in architecture as the
one we live in; for the Stadthuys of Nieuw Amsterdam
was of all the edifices that adorned that ancient city, the
one on which it might pride itself the most, being a very
model of buildings of the kind, on a plan at once ample
and convenient, and worthy of the spirit by which it had
been raised: it was in front of three stories high,
composed
of neat Dutch brick, well plaistered and put
together
with lime mortar made of oyster shells dragged in
the waters of Kill van Kull, and which had of old been
preferred from the best Holland lime by that judicious
personage, Mienheer Kieft, who had made repeated
experiments
of its merit, in the erection of numerous public
edifices, with which during his administration he had
graced the metropolis of the Nieuw Nederlandts; indeed
the stadthuis was itself on the scite of one of the old Dutch
governor's structures, and occupied the ground on which
had stood the famous stadt-herberg, or city tavern,
whereon
the liberal and munificent Hollander had expended at
once all the taste and treasure of invention of his
ingenious
mind; for if the historian hath done Kieft justice,
he must have been a stout little Dutchman, of magnificent
and stupendous ideas, which were laid out to admirable
purpose, in the zeal with which he straitened the
crooked
streets, demolished the ancient public buildings, and
raised on their ruins stately piles of wood and stone,
which were long the boast of the burghers of Nieuw
Amsterdam
;
in truth Kieft was the Palladio of the colony,
and it is with satisfaction perceived some little of his
spirit of improvement has been caught in these days, the
effects of which, were he alive, would make the thrifty
Nederlander start in wonder and delight; for now the
desire of being busy as well as that of splendor, and of
changing Nieuw Amsterdam into a second Athens, that
filled the bosom of the emulous Kieft, exists with
powerful
influence, and urges forward the varied municipal
additions
,
which keep in motion both the minds of our city
rulers and the money of the citizens, in the laying out,
running, and widening of highways, the levelling of old
houses, and the erection of new ones, and of pulling down
in every quarter, each small and comfortable building for
the sake of raising in their steads tall ungainly heaps of
brick, which are so slightly laid as to threaten daily to
topple on their inhabitants; but indeed there can be no
better example of the excellence of a sway immediate
from the people, than is used in effecting the first of these,
the opening of streets and squares, the original design of
which mostly is awakened in the reflective brain of some
sapient member of the City Council, who, having
property
badly situated, takes on himself to increase its
value and make his fortune, (which, by the by, is but
right, seeing his municipal services are rendered without
pay,) by making some new street through the grounds of
his neighbours to his own advantage and to the
destruction
both of their comforts and residences; at the same
time smoothing the hurt and injury done, by the cries of
hirelings who have been promised pay, from contracts of
digging paving, or building at the public expense, and who
therefore preach up the benefits of the improvement, so
that the unfortunate man whose ground increases in value
from these causes, has to pay for the expected good more
than is allowed for what is taken from him, and twice
that which he can obtain for what is left, which, on being
forced to abandon in despair, falls into the hands of some
worthy burgomaster for little or nothing, while its original
possessor is a ruined man by the very means he was
promised
to have made a mint of wealth: and while such
consequence
follows the one, the others keep up a continual
commotion of noise and dust, filling the eyes and spoiling
the coats of all who pass such spots, as where the shallow
pomp and empty vanity of some purse proud knave sprang
from the stable or the cow yard, the amasser of riches by
chance and roguery rather than deserts, raises a palace
for his office or his dwelling. But as to the stadthuis of
Nieuw Amsterdam;at the era of the narrative, it was
an entire new mansion, and in its erection neither expense
nor talent had been spared as befitted a lordly Dutch
city; in truth, if confidence is to be placed in the register
of the day, and the receipts as recorded of the city
collector
,
Baruche Judah, are accurate, and the contrary is not
to be presumed, no less a sum than four hundred pounds,
seawant value, was assessed on the groodt und kleiner
Burgerrecht of New Yorke for the purpose, every one
paying in proportion to his property and wealth; his
honour
Colonel Frederick Phillipse, contributing as became
his high standing and superior riches, seventeen shillings
and sixpence, wampum peague, a sum at once enormous
for one man, liberal and magnificent as should be
remembered
to the praise of the donor:

possessed of such large
and ample means to commence the grand undertaking,
before
the corner stone was laid, the committee of
Burgomasters
,
to whose care the matter had been committed,
sat in profound dubitation and council upon the numerous
draughts and plans, that from every corner of the
province
had been showered on them for acceptance; indeed
a reward had been offered for the one that should please,
and there was not an architect in the Nieuw Nederlandts,
but who strove for the prize, and as may be supposed, the
variety for choice exceeded all measure, from copies of
every noble structure boasted of in der Vaderlandt, to the
tall spired Indian pagoda. Long and doubtful was the
deliberation
ere a decision was made, for such was the
precise
and judicious taste that guided the burgomasters,
that scarce any thing that was presented to them, could
satisfy their fastidious desires of perfection, and indeed it is
a chance, if their opinion had been ever settled, although
they smoked much, and drank deep during the consultation,
had it not been for the pre-eminent genius of burgomaster
Outhout, to whom posterity must ever remain indebted;
for with sagacious skill, after having turned over all the
papers, he seized on the uppermost one, being the nearest
at hand, and declared with a round hollandsche oath,
that dat vash der ding vor hish bleazure mit zome liddle
dalderazion dat he mould make in a minute, and his
sage opinion was agreed to without dispute; however the
alterations to which the sapient burgomaster referred, were
submitted to his judgment entirely, as all were well aware
they would not in the burgomaster's hand increase the
expenditure: indeed, if possible his determination was to
diminish it, without hurt to the beauty of the intended
15*
building, which stood many years a monument of his
wisdom
;
for although the composition of the model, was in
all points in proportion, yet desirous of saving a few
guilders
of the public money, with honest Dutch thriftiness,
he curtailed it of one third of its breadth; he likewise
sunk the first story and raised the second, so that it might
in somewise, resemble a tall man mounted on the
shoulders
of a small one; and as he verily shuddered with
affright
when he computed the immense cost of brick which
must have been imported from Holland, to finish the
whole building, he bethought himself of an excellent
device
,
that as the rear of the edifice looked on the rasp huis,
the cellar kitchen of which was kept by vrouw Burger, it
mattered not of what the same was composed. The
front therefore of the structure was only brick, painted a
flaming dutch yellow, at once brilliant and costly, while
the other part of the building was of a rough brown stone,
without color or finish whatsoever, so that the
Stadt-huis
might be compared to a vestcoat, very fine in front,
but common behind. Nevertheless although burgomaster
Outhout, was lauded long and loudly, for such excellent
procedure, and acquired more fame thereby, than any of
his name, since first they had emigrated from
Schenkenshaus
,
in Betuwe on the Waal, where his ancestry had
drove a respectable trade in the cod fishery, on the
dogger
bank, on occupying the edifice, some little
inconvenience
it must be admitted was encountered, which
however
,
it was impossible to lay to the burgomaster's
restrictions
,
there being in some places a want of light, and
in others too much thereof, some rooms being huge,
long and large, with ceilings, against which the voice
made no sound, but dissipated as it were in the open air,
a grievous thing for weak lunged orators, while others
were so small and cut up, that there was scarce doing any
thing with them;all this gave rise and food to envy, from
the rival and disappointed architects, and as may be
surmised
,
they strove to hit off some tart jokes against the noble
building at the cost of their successful comate, who
however
,
as the latter was justly entitled to, laid all the honor
to the door of the burgomaster, and even it is said, in the
offervescence of his admiration, shared the best part of the
reward for the model with that sapient and puissant
dignitary
,
which if true, does credit to the proper sense, in
which the worthy burgomaster's talents were estimated,
and puts to defiance all the sarcasms of enemies; one of
whom Peiter Mesier, a runaway bookeverkooper, or
bookseller's
apprentice, from Hammerkin in the low countries,
a sorry wag, who presumed on an acquaintance with
classic
lore, having once held the bridle of the mule rode
by Thomas a Kempis, (who lived in his neighborhood,
on the river Aa, between Yssel and Vecht,) it is rumored,
had the audacity, in the presence of Mienheer William
Jannewaaye, der milkmensch, (on whom however the
spleen lost effect, for he was a dotard, ignorant,
hardheaded
crone, awake only to the gathering of pelf, scarce
knowing how to read or write,) to compare the stadthuis of
the Nieuw Nederlandts, and the mighty, sapient, puissant,
and disinterested personages concerned in its
superstructure
,
to the raising of the famous Town Hall, of
Scheldterbergsh
,
in Allemagne, of which his story ran thus. The
Scheldterbergers being desirous of raising a magnificent
city building, and having set about it in earnest, soon
completed a structure at no little cost to themselves, and
the neighbouring cities, who contributed thereto, the whole
being under the direction of one the greatest architects, the
Scheldterbergsh could produce. The exterior of the
edifice
was finished to the admiration of all who gazed on it;
crowds rushed in the interior to view it, but what was their
surprise on entering the council chamber, to find it dark
as midnight, so that they bumped against each other's
shins and noses at a terrible rate, and with dolorous
execution
;
the reason of this phenomenon set them all in
amazewhile the truth was thisthe chief builder
being
a man wide awake to his own interest, and a certain
sum being allowed for the work, had argued arithmetically,
that one window would do for at least four, and by
putting
in one in the place of four, the expense and cost of
three would be clear profit to him; however, finding
the wise men of Scheltderbergsh somewhat crusty at
the explanation he was forced to make, he told them
that if they considered the want of light an evil, it was
easily remediedthat they had but to get large bags and
open them in the sun, and they could catch as much light
as they wished; the idea took, and every bag in the
city was in requisition: this difficulty being got over, a
new one sprung upowing to the crowd of great men
living at Scheldterbergsh, there was, on putting each
man in his place of state, found to be a want of room, which
caused a grievous complaint, and was a drawback on the
boast of the architect of the hall, which was intended to
serve for ages, and also a great disadvantage to the city;
for those who could not get room in the edifice,
withdrew
to a neighbouring tavern in a great huff, and
whether
owing to liquor, or the choler natural to their being
almost ejected from the building, fell at loggerheads with
such fury that it was feared they might pull off each other's
ears: the council of Scheldterbergsh being thereon
greatly
disturbed, took the matter in consideration; whereon
it was moved and acceded to, that an antidote to their
troubles should be tried, by putting in force an
ingenious
contrivance suggested by the architect, whom the
matter had so intimately concerned;he proposed that
the Scheldterbergers being in the interior, should place
their backs against the walls and push them out, thereby
enlarging the building so as to receive all persons, to
whom place therein should be given; whereupon, with
grievous grunting, groaning, labouring, and sweating,
they set tobut after a long trial, they could not
perceive
they had made progress in their enterprise, and
were about to become enraged against the proposer and
proposal, but he requesting their patience, advised all to
divest themselves of their cloaks, and spread them at
the foot of the walls on the outer side; which being done
and the attempt renewed, the architect slily carried away
the offcast garments, while the Scheldterbergers coming
out and seeing them gone, set up a loud shout of success,
supposing they had pushed the walls so as to cover their
cloaks and hide them under the foundation. Now
Mienheer
Mesier applied this veritable high German story to
be a right allegory, and in point;the cunning architect
and builder being easily divined, while the gulled
Scheldterbergers
were plainly the Nieuw Amsterdammers, equally
taken with the fabrications and deceit of every rogue
who chose to make his fortune from the public folly,
and ever ready to become the dupes of any artifice,
however palpable or absurd, which wily and designing
knaves may offer as a bait for them to swallow; withal,
however, its flaming and shining hue, the Stadthuys of
Nieuw Amsterdam was a heavy and sombre building,
with a huge, tall, tiled roof, and small dark prison-looking
windows, the pediments of which were of stoneand in
the uppermost story, which served as a gaol, garnished
with gratings and stanchells of iron.
Following the course from the outward gate, which
was now wide open, but which, when closed, was usually
secured by strong bars and bolts, and a chain which led
across it on the inside, the crowd thronged through
the huge hall of the edifice, the walls of which were
rough and unplaistered in many places, and green with
damp as the sides of a dungeon, being cheerless and
naked
,
except where they were garnished with hangings of
iron fetters, and uncouth implements of torture,
interspersed
with weapons of war, arquebusses, pistolets and
partuizans of antique make and form; and made their
way to a low and arched entrance, before which, stood
two civil officers with tall staffs, who, nearly in vain,
strove to distinguish those to allow admission,and
endeavoured
to drive back, with all the mightiness of
authority
,
the commoner herd, who pushed upon them in
despite of threats and commands. Indeed the
consciousness
of the possession of power, however limited and
contemptible, like that of riches, inflates the mind to a
forgetfulness of every thing except its own mightiness
and a person, who, but a day gone by, met and greeted
you cordially as an equal, be he advanced only to the
shadow of dignity beyond his former state, thinks a cold
nod of contemptuous indifference sufficient, if even he
cares so far to recognize his former intimate or associate.
This feeling, judging from the appearance, seemed
peculiarly
to inhabit the breasts of the two guardians of
the door that opened in the apartment, wherein sat some
of the lordly magistracy of New-Yorke, for the
crossing
of the threshold, from the anxiety manifested to
pass it, rather increased than diminished by the
opposition
made thereto, which was evidently a matter of
moment
to the burghers, which was the more apparent,
when after a severe and warm contention of crowding,
pushing, jostling, tramping, kicking, plunging,
shouldering
and shoving on both sides, during which, in despite
of vigilance or exertion, here and there an agile fellow,
with an eely slide would elude all caution, and slip from
the herd of his less fortunate companions, into the
apartment
;
an interval, or rather breathing space of mastery,
was obtained by the puissant keepers of the door way,
over those who claimed admittanceduring which, the
greetings and epithets of kindness, that were showered
from the lips of petitioners on the officers, were
innumerable
although nugatory, and served merely to increase
their obdurity, by swelling their opinions of their own
self importance: this was more peculiarly evident in the
conduct of one of them, a short thick man, with a black
surly visage, that resembled a cross-grained muzzled
mastiff, and who, to the numerous calls on his
acquaintance
and remembrance, was as deaf as a beetle, and with
a coarse growl, bid all keep backalthough this bearish
consequence was often dropped to servile humility,
whenever his eye singled out a person struggling in the
crowd whom he supposed of more power than himself,
and for whose benefit, he exerted himself straightway
to make room,and this last conduct was also followed,
whenever any one was ingenious enough to slip a
schilling
in his hand unperceived, and who, whatever were
his disadvantages, quickly was preferred before all that
might have stood in precedence before him. But now
for the interior of the room thus strictly guarded: it
was long and vaulted, with a stone floor, and massive
benches of the same material, placed in rows from the
wall, of which every seat was fast receiving an
occupant
,
while the apartment itself was filling to an
overflow
:
at the upper end, the room was divided by a short
railing, on the farther side of which, were on one part,
large yokes of plank or stocks for confining criminals,
by which stood several ragged and meanly attired men
and women, who, by their miserable and squalid looks,
for in some, there was a singular mixture of hardihood
and unconcern, while others, with anxious eye and pale
cheek, gazed about with fearful, uncertain and
wandering
glances, were persons, expecting either to undergo
trial or judgment. These were attended by soldiers of
the hofdt wagt: on the part opposite to that last
described
,
were two forms or benches, the one raised
higher, and beyond the other: on the latter was seated,
in all the pomp and pride of a judge, Dirk Van
Rikketie
while
on either side of him were placed, in
monstrous
arm chairs of the brightest mahogany,
burgomasters
Gelyn Verplancke and Filkins: the seats on the
other, and lower bench, were filled with the officers
of the court, the king's attorney, public notaries,
auditors
,
common or town clerk, court messenger or
crier, and various other attendants on whom it was
a duty to be present at the burgomasters hof; while the
large apartment was rendered comfortable to its
numerous
sojourners by a fire of blocks and billets of wood,
which roared, blazed and ascended with smoke and
flame, up a huge tunnel, the mouth of which was large
enough to accommodate the greatest log cut by the
woodman
.
In the situation he was now placed, Dirk Van
Rikketie greatly was delighted, and was apparently at
perfect ease: indeed it was proverbial that he loved
the very stench of the apartmentfor as the principal
of those who were brought before him were negroes,
Indians, or the lowest sweepings of the whites, the word
in the dog days, though vulgar, was not misappliedand
now he looked on the crowd before him with exquisite
complaisance, and now he whispered some joke to his
sapient associates, who grinned in return with solemn
shakes of the head, and looked wondrous wise and
edified
at his sallies. The anxiety that stirred the
populace
was not unknown to Dirk, nor did he feel adverse
to gratifying their curiosity as far as he was able,
neither
did he deem it prudent for him to let slip an
opportunity
wherein he could please the crowd, and show
by words his devotedness to the new order of affairs that
had commenced in the colonytherefore, as soon as
the crier had finished, and the common clerk, who was
a shock headed, queer, and testy looking little
Frenchman
,
a huegonot emigrant ftom Provence, had proclaimed
the court in session, having first advised in a whisper
with the burgomasters beside him, in which consultation
Dirk Van Rikketie was the only speaker, those he
communicated with, nodding wisely an assent to all he
advanced, possibly fearful of words, lest they should
commit themselves in ignorance, in dispute with so
learned a jurist, Dirk addressed the burghers in
hearing
.
First he spoke sadly and mournfully on the
distraction
of the timesthe horrors of civil war, and the
distressing
length to which party spirit had been carried,
`the woful tragedy that had so lately happened,' he said,
was much to be regrettedand yet he could not help
thinking that the two rash and unfortunate men, from
their turbulence, and the insolent manner with which they
had demeaned themselves towards his excellencie the
governor, (whom the lord preserve for many years to
rule over the province of New-Yorke) had met a fate,
though a dreadful one, which they deserved, seeing, if
they had survived, they could only have been
considered
as attainted traitors: secondly, their majesties, in
their sovereign goodness, had sent over to govern the
colony, a man possessing every virtue under heaven; a
pious manan honourable mana merciful manyea,
for his, (the speaker's part) he had long, by reputation,
been acquainted with the good name of colonel
Sloughter
,
for an honest fame was sweet smelling and savoury,
like a herb of perfumeand he had heard of the
govenor's
name across the far waters, long ere he had
beheld his benignant face; and he was ready to vouch,
a better man than his excellency, did not existnay,
breathed not in Europe or America; for well he could
foresee, that under his government, peace and happiness
was not only to be restored, but to reign perennial; the
province would be a land flowing with milk and honey,
and the envy of every other colony on the sea board;
and what was not the ancient enemy, the Canadian, to
fear, from the prowess of his arm already? As they
heard his name, they trembledand the Count De
Frontenac knew his conqueror. Heaven grant his
excellency
many years of life, to fulfil all his promise.'
Then he strenuously exhorted all good citizens, to be
firm in their allegiance to their highnesses the king and
queen, and to assist to the uttermost in all he might be
pleased to undertake, his excellencie, their distinguished
subject, the governor of the loyal colony of New-Yorke:
and thirdly, he informed them, that their excellent and
worthy fellow citizens, Colonel Nicholas Bayard, and
master Walter Nichols, had been set at liberty, and
rescued unharmed, from the dungeons in which they
had been so vilely detained by the wicked and
turbulent
partizans of Jacobus Leisler, and had been
restored to all the powers, offices, and emoluments
which they formerly held, and which said the speaker, I
pray they may long enjoy, and lastly his excellencie the
Governor, in supreme goodness, mercy, justice and
wisdom
,
had ordered a commission of Oyer and Terminer,
to be issued to Sir Thomas Robinson, Colonel Smith,
himself, Dirk Van Rikketie, and other judicial
authorities
,
for the trial on charges of rebellion, against their
leige sovereigns King William and Queen Mary, of the said
Jacobus Leisler, Pieter De Lanoy, and their adherents,
who were now in close confinement, in the very building
in which the Court was sitting, `and though the lord
forfend
that he should say, that he believed any man guilty
before he was so adjudged, yet he would venture to affirm
in such case an they were convicted, he for himself would
vouch, and he had no doubt of the honorable and
worthy
gentleman joined with him, that although their duty
might be a painful and really distressing one, considering
the ties of citizenship, and intimacy, which bound them to
the culprits, yet it would be firmly performed, without
regard
to any thing except strict justice, for it was a
maxim
with him, the greater the convict, the greater should
be the example.' This gracious and important
communication
being ended, in the course of which, Dirk had ex
Vol. II. 16
pressed sentiments that were diametrically opposite to
those on his lips but the day before, but which were now
the most profitable and reigning opinions, and therefore
he espoused them; the throng was somewhat thinned,
many dispersing to retail to their expectant acquaintances,
that which they had heard from the veracious tongue of
the geheim Schryveir, though others remained, withheld
by curiosity, while the court pursued their ordinary
business
.
There was sentencing of greedy tavern keepers,
who in despite of law had supplied supper parties of
jovial
dutchmen, after the ringing of the bell, or who had
made some thirsty half bred Indian drunk, although the
council had passed an edict against such conduct, and
allowed
the word of the savage when sober, as conclusive
evidence against the criminal, who had dared to
contravene
the statute, by giving him food for beastlinesse;
[17]
[17]
Vid. Records of the Nieuw Nederlandts.
there were riotous sailors who had been in the holy land,
and creating disturbances with peaceable burghers, had
drawn their knives on the patrouille, who had been called
to quell the riot; these were condemned to throw
themselves
three times each one, from the sail yard of the
yacht to which they belonged, and receive from each
fellow
mariner on board, three lashes apiece. There were
also matters wherein the judge's discrimination and
decision
were more widely exercised, some of these were
cases in which the delict had been informed against, for
eluding the spirit and letter of the laws made for public
security
and welfare, as where an adventurous swine, the
property
of a griping old fellow called Hauns Pieterse, had
strayed into the kitchen garden of burgomaster Bresier, and
cropped all the best of his cabbages; whereupon the
burgomaster
became so worth, he being a mighty lover of
good eating, and passionately fond of cabbages, that he
seized upon the fourlegged offender, and had him
impounded
,
against which proceeding Pieterse appealed;-whereon
after maturely hearing the point in controversy, judgment
was given thus equitable, that as Pieterse it appeared was
not fit to keep hogs, the porker was forfeited, and ordered
to be sold at the next fair, and the proceeds of
his sale, to be divided proportionately, half to the
justices
,
and half to the informer, the said
burgomaster
Bresier, and the konstabel were commanded to
pay the costs. Numerous indeed were the admirable
constructions and illustrative definitions of the
jurisprudence
of the province propounded and pronounced by the
sapient Dirk Van Rikketie, and acceded to by his no
less wise and erudite associates, in the many similar
causes which came before them. Now, although the
statute laws of the colony in themselves were at this time
few, and (as might be supposed from perusal) easy of
being understood, being that singular code well known to
the antiquarian by the title of The Duke's laws, yet
nevertheless, while these were in some sort the common
law of the land, the members of the colonial assembly
and the burgomasters of the city were daily, in their
discreet
wisdom, drafting and publishing edicts after their
own sovereign will, which natheless unmeant by them,
went in direct contravention to the Jus nov
eboracensis
;
whereby, two opposite ordinances being in equal
force, a criminal was condemned by one, and cleared for
the same misdemeanour by the other; so, doing little
help to either morals, justice, or to the community. And
when, after having done incalculable service to wealthy
and powerful rogues, and having been the bane or death
of every poor vagabond who was unable from want of
money to bribe fortune, (for that reigns above right or
wrong, and to it justice is subservient;) a dead set was
perhaps made to remedy the evil by passing some
amendment
to the original form of the act: but as most
opportunely
for the well being of society, the honest men whose
unthankful duty it behoves to enact laws have generally
less care to make them perfect than the rogue, whose
chief study it has always been to find some hole in the
labour, of which he may avail himselfthe matter of
complaint
by such new consideration was often rendered worse;
and so the thing was necessary to be again and again
reviewed
,
but seldom to any better purpose. Although the
acts themselves would have scarce filled a diminutive
volume
,
yet their additions made ponderous tomes; for indeed
both resembled the will of some peevish old man with a
large estate, who every day found cause to change the
disposal
of his property, and one hour makes a codicil, which
in the next he destroys to make way for two others
diametrically
opposite to his former intention, and probably ere
long both the last are revoked to make room for twice
their number, varying the disposition of the
hypochondriac's
estate in a manner in which he is not a whit more
satisfied
.
Now, as may be supposed, the confusion arising from
the multiplicity of sub-edicts was the very element in which
the sagacity, probity and acuteness of Dirk was
pre-eminent
;
and the reader cannot be surprised from what he
hath already read of the talents of this learned
character
,
that the skill with which he thrided the labyrinth
was at once superior and astonishing; in truth, no man
living could apply the letter of the law so perfectly as he
could; he knew well when the time was proper to
impose
a slight mulct, and when, for the self same
infringement
of the public peace, a severe corporal punishment
ought to be inflicted; and withal, he was a merciful
creature
,
imbued with the very milk of human kindness; for
he was at all times ready to intercede for a pardon for the
very vilest convict, if some influential man requested it
of him. Indeed, the records of Nieuw Nederlandts are
fraught with numberless examples of the
gehemschryver's
virtues, for it was an invariable rule with him to
correct all reports of causes that came before him, by
erasing every thing that tended to interfere with the side
of the question which in his wisdom it had pleased him to
espouse; and no one can blame him therefor, seeing that
iniquity and wickedness can present many times a
plausible
set of motives for action, which, as evil has more
converts
and followers than virtue, might (being given
publicity
)
be tended with ill effects on minds in whom a
neutrality as to the matter may have made but poor and
uninterested judges; whereas the light in which Dirk had
eyed the subject being showered on the public, it totally
suppressed all murmurs of contradiction or
condemnation
of the course he had chosen; for Dirk was fully
aware of the nature of mankind, and well knew no human
work is so perfect as to please every body. An example of
the rigorous, certain and unimpeachable manner in which
Dirk construed the penal statutes of the colony was
observable
at the hour of the narrative, in the sentence which in
conjunction with the puissant burgomasters who were at
his elbow, he passed upon two certain offenders;
considerable
interest and attention had been excited on the
occasion
,
and after burgomaster Breiser's and Hauns Peiterse's
business was disposed of, there was a hum of expectation
and conjecture among the crowd of hearers that thronged
the apartmentDirk's countenance became more solemn
and important, and his two puissant supporters shook their
heads with pompous gravity; while every understrapper
of the court took the infection, and demeaned himself in
accordance with the visages of his superiors. Now the
fact, as appears from the chronicles yet extant, in the
first case, was this:there was one Jan Hobbes, of
facetious
memory, of whom a mention hath been heretofore
slightly made, a meddlesome, scandalous fellow, given
wonderfully to writing and making books, and therefore
was considered a person of little consequence in the stadt,
his calling being a mean trade and not allowed the city
license as a freeman. Now Jan being of a mischievous
nature and terribly discontented with the times, took on
himself to prove that matters and things were not as they
ought to have been, and that the lusty burghers of Nieuw
Amsterdam had derogated from the honesty and virtue
of their ancestors who had first founded the Dorp; and
being
misled by wrong advice, `and not,' as the tradition
forcibly remarks, `having the fear of man and the law in
his sight,' did most sacrilegiously and outrageously
profane
the people's ear with the unworthiness of certain
friends of Dirk Van Rikketie. Now it must be apparent
that nothing can be more libellous or disgusting to sense
and feeling than for a dirty fellow to brush against our
best attire and leave mud and stains upon us as he passes
or what can be more offensive than for a scavenger to
shake his dirt and dust in our faces after we have just
cleansed ourselves from impurity? `yet such were nothing,'
saith the tradition, `compared to the acts of wilful Jan'
who without the least delicacy or remorse, such a har
16*
dened creature was he, by the most indelicate allusions
recalled to the minds of great men what they had been.
`The horrid enormity thrills one with affright,' continues
the sensitive writer of the chronicle; `hanging, the
wooden horse, and the cucking stool, were all too little
for such a wretch, who dared boldly tell the truth, even
though he insulted the sacred presence of a burgomaster.'
Now after this ebullition of rage and indignation, the
chronicler goes into a learned dissertation on truth,
wherein he concludes that to speak it to any man of
influence or power is a most unpardonable
aggression
,
and deserves the thumbscrew. Now Jan,
although
he ought to have known of the risk he was at
of certain punishment for his crime, for had he tasked his
memory he would have recollected how Hendrick Jansen,
in the days of Wouter Van Twiller, was sentenced for
scandalizing the governor to a heavy penalty, namely, to
ride with face to the tail, behind the town crier, on a
jackass through the principal streets, the libeller having a
bridle in his mouth, a bunch of rods under his arm, and
an appropriate label on his breast, and acknowledge that
he lied falsely
[18]
[18]
Records of Nieuw Nederlandts.
dat de exegellenge did niet wears rood
broeks nor was grate mit hish plack frouw. Neither
was there anything of which, in his wickedness, Jan could
be made to repent, for he was a stubborn sinner:
therefore
Dirk off hand pronounced him guilty of all charges
brought against him, considering it utterly unimportant
that Jan should be heard at all in his defence; for what
could any one say for himself that had perpetrated crimes
so heinouswho had without compunction ridiculed the
consequence of a warrior tailor, exposed the mock
importance
of sundry self-conceited magnificents, and
laughed
with irreverent scorn at the grave decorum and
splendid
attainments of divers spectacled and profound Dutch
doctors and professors,rendering by such derision of no
avail the laborious endeavours of these puissant and
sapient
characters, to impress the minds of the burghers of
the Nieuw Nederlandts with a high opinion of their vast
erudition, ingenuity, and mightiness. Now it must be
premised that Dirk well knew Jan Hobbes was not worth
a groat, and therefore had but little chance of having
over many influential characters step forward in his
favour
;
yet at the bottom of his heart there lurked a latent
fear that in case he enraged the satirist, he might turn his
venom on him. `Although in such conclusion Dirk
must have been deceived,' saith the Chronicle, `for no
man, not even Jan Hobbes, could have been of so ruthless
a disposition as to injure the fine and delicate feelings of
an honourable man of the virtue, candour, good-nature,
and perfect honesty and disinterestedness of Dirk Van
Rikketie;'howbeit the wisdom of Dirk was exercised
in the matter, so that hereafter he might excuse himself
to Jan. He therefore, well knowing the answer that
would be received, inquired first of Burgomaster Filkins,
his opinion whether or no it would be popular to send Jan
to the Rasp huis, and quoted authorities therefor; as was
to be expected, Filkins, although he thought the matter
had better be made up, yet as he wanted Dirk to interest
himself in getting the vroedschap to pass a law to widen a
street where he held property, assented without
refutation
of Dirk's various arguments pro and con; and
Burgomaster Gelyne, on Dirk's inquiry, bowed with
grave dignity his head in acquiescence, he having been
before the matter came up impressed against Jan by
his comate burgomaster Ezel-een Mensch, the mortal
foeman of the wicked satiristso Dirk secure in shifting
the blame from his own shoulders on that of his associates
if any should be found, went on in decreeing the
punishment
of Jan Hobbes, with stern composure; after
descanting
largely and uncontradicted, Jan not being allowed a
word, on the enormity of the offence, which was, as Dirk
sublimely expressed it, with a significant annotation,
worse than murder or robbery, for as the poet laid down,
he that steals my purse steals trash; but he that filches
my good name, makes me poor indeedDirk closed
(however, first taking care to bestow one or two
compliments
on Jan's talents, as was his custom, to keep Jan in
a good humour with himself,) by saying that the Court,
in mercy to his poverty, had fined him a sum of money
which he knew Jan was then unable to pay, therefore, in
commutation of his fine, they committed him to the
rasphuis
until he could make the money to discharge the
mulct, and as authority for such procedure, he drew
profusely from the case of Baron Van Slightenhorst, the
agent for the Patroon of Ranselearwyck, who having
quarreled with Governor Stuyvesant, in the earlier day
of the Nieuw Nederlandt, on some question of jurisdiction
between that manor and the colony, was arrested and
confined by the order of the testy old Dutchman at Nieuw
Amsterdam on a charge of crimen las majestatis, and
heavily
fined therefor, in a certain sum, but which,
understanding
he was ready to pay, having the money, the
Court that condemned reconsidered their fiat, and
doubled
the amount of the mulct, the first being supposed no
punishment, as he could discharge it, and on appeal from
the last decree, the baron complained that neither
himself
nor friends were in any wise able to raise the
required
money, the Governor decided, that the baron should
stay in prison till he could make it,
[19]
[19]
Vid. Records of Nieuw Nederlandts, 1652.
or until he begged his
pardon, and got the Court to recommend him to mercy.
The other delinquent that was brought before this
incorruptible
trio, was a noisy, vain, blustering blackguard,
coxcomb of a fellow, the gossip of the town, a man whose
veracity was as doubtful as his principles were bad: he
was charged with theft, in stealing and breaking open a
letter directed to a worthy burgher, in whose affairs he
was somewhat curious, and with whose private business
this convict was desirous of meddling and of exposing his
secrets to the city; the matter was completely made out
against the criminal, but he being an intimate of Dirk,
this wise and irreproachable judge considered it proper,
as he could not pass an impartial sentence on him, that
the same should be postponed until he should leave the
office of Geheim Schryveir, which might one day or the
other come to pass, as he supposed, or otherwise until
the last mentioned criminal should become his enemy,
which might be the case in his espousing the wrong side
in some political struggle. After this last proceeding was
gone through with, the business of the day being over,
and the city bell about to ring the signal for dinner, for
which, after the fulfilment of such arduous judicial duties
as they had performed, none felt more eager than the
magistrates; the prisoners, sentenced and unsentenced,
were removed to safe keeping, and by direction, the
hoarse voice of the crier, in formal manner, adjourned
the hoofdt, and Dirk and his puissant associates prepared
to leave their seats of dignity, and mingle in the body of
the dispersing audience, who were fain to wend away
with homeward steps; but ere Dirk had crossed the
apartment, his steps were stayed as were the
burgomasters
,
whose departures were regulated by his motions;
a stripling, partly enveloped in a cloak, and who
appeared
to have been watching the breaking up of the Court
with eager and anxious impatience, sprang from a bench
by which Dirk was about passing, and with imploring
looks and in beseeching tones entreated his attention as
he clung to his garments and withheld his departure
Stay but a for moment, Mienheers, exclaimed the youth
in a pleading and mournful tone, stay but for a moment,
Sirs; ye who have been the bosom friends of the
unfortunate
Jacob Leisler; ye who I have seen his supporters
and confidants, and more particularly you, heer Dirk, for
whom he hath done so much, stay your steps but for a
minuteby the memory of your former friendship, your
ancient league and alliance; by all that hath passed in
favour
between ye, Sirs, I entreat, charge ye bestow
kindness
on his child, on Arnyte Leisler, who stands before
you. For hours vain have I strove to gain a minute's
sight, a word with himI have been put back by loaded
guns of guards, and driven with hoarse threats from my
attempts. Good friends, I only ask ye to allow me to
share his rugged dungeon with him, to sit by him and
console him in his sorrows, to support his aged head upon
my breastfor God's sake, Sirs, though the world may
have deserted him, though all whom he relied on may
have turned foes; let him not in the darkness of his wo
for a moment suppose that I, his son, his child, have fled
him toohave turned recreant with the rest.
The feelings with which Dirk heard and received this
address, were by no means those of complaisance, indeed
he was as much startled by the sudden and unlooked for
presence of Arnyte, as if in his pathway a serpent had
sprang up and met his approach with barbed and
poisonous
tongue, nor were the words of the stripling over well
chosen, either for the attainment of that he petitioned
for, had there at the moment been any inclination in Dirk's
breast to grant it, or such as, as they reminded him of
passages
,
which, at the present, he would fain have had
forgotten
,
were well calculated to be acceptable to his
hearing
,
he therefore, judging by his actions and countenance,
appeared not a little displeased by his detention, and with
quick and somewhat fearful glances, he looked about him
to see who was within hearing, and then with a hasty and
impatient motion, he strove to drag the skirt of his jerkin
from the hands of the youth, but he failed, for Arnyte
hung to it with all the pertinacity of despair.
Nay, you shall not leave me, cried he, you shall
not do yourself the wrong to quit me thus, plunged in the
bitterness of affliction, nor extend the hand to help me in
my grief; the world speaks of you as a merciful, a
compassionate
man; belie it notshow pity unto methe
favour I seek is small in granting, yet if I gain it not, I
shall be most wretched, most miserable.
Finding it difficult to unloose the hold of the stripling
without answer and in silence, unless by main force, Dirk
unbent his sternness, and in his most generous and
considerate
manner, explained to Arnyte the impossibility of
his complying with his desires, as it was in direct
contravention
he asserted to his excellency, the Governor's
orders
on the matter; and that by permitting any person,
even his son, to have an interview at this time with an
attainted
traitor, like Jacobus Leisler, he would be
committing
crime as a man, and betraying the trust imposed
on him, as holding the station with which he was honoured
by public confidence; the fact was, the thing was entirely
against all rules and regulations, nay, against the law of
the colony itself; he much regretted itit was a hard
case it must be confessed; but so it was, and he could
show the book, the very page, where the strictness of
procedure
that was pursued with Mienheer Leisler was laid
down incontrovertibly; therefore he concluded it was
idle to request that which he was unable in any wise to
allow, and advised with the most friendly solicitude for his
welfare, that the young man should depart and make up
his mind to the dire necessity, as easy as the exigency
would suffer: and then finding the grasp of Arnyte relax
in utter hopelessness at his refusal of entrance to his
parent
,
he eagerly snatched the hem of his garment by
which he had been detained from the trembling hands of
the youth, and hastily strode away, leaving his suitor
overwhelmed with misfortune.
He bids me begone! he bids me home! alas, I have
now no home; no roof shelters now the ruined family of
Leisler, ejaculated, after a moment's pause, the agonized
stripling, and what shall I do hence, when my duty lies
here? away I can give no relief; the heart-broken
murmurs
of my poor mother distract me in our miserable home,
and I cannot sooth them even with hope, and here, yes,
in my father's dungeon my duty lies. Stay and hear me,
continued he, interposing himself before the departing
burgomasters, ye are fathers! ye have sons, even as
myself: reflect! did your situation as that of mine call on
your offspring, bethink ye, from that love they should
bear ye, in gratitude for the hours of servance in infancy,
the care, tears, and anxiety, ye have bestowed upon their
helplessness, were it not hard, cruel, to be denied but to
gaze upon your face, to clasp your hand, to share your
misery. If ye are men, formed in the mould of humanity:
if your hearts are not harder than the gyves that hang
upon yon wall, ye cannot deny my reasonable
beseeching
ah!
and will ye not listen to me? can ye have the
souls, the frozen, icy souls to leave me with denial? for
mercy, sirs, can ye think light of the charge upon me?
remember ye not the precept of the holy book, and
would ye interfere with the commands of him whose
chariot is the whirlwind? I have spoken to you as fathers;
ye have been sons too; ye have felt the fostering care,
the tender warding from harm, and the thousand
indescribable
links of parental tenderness; then will ye
hinder
,
for a moment, a son seeking to refund the great debt
so strongly bound upon his existence, yea, for life; for
when have I wept and he had the power that my tears
were not dried; hath he not borne me through the
dangers
of my infancy and should he have cause to believe
that in this hour of adversity ungratefully I shunned his
fortunenay, tell me it not, though it hath been so said,
the Governor's mandate doth not intervene; ye have the
power and can admit me to clasp his neck and kiss his
aged cheek.
The stern determination of the sturdy burgomasters
was not, however, to be shaken by the piteous pleadings
of young Arnyte. They were possessed in too great a
degree with the influence of that base tyrannical feeling,
so common in the breast of man, that delights to have
acknowledged by the degradation of his creatures, the
power and superiority which it is luxury to exercise on
all but mercyyes, there are some who, like statues,
love to hear their fellow beings sue and pray in vain,
proud in their hour of might, nor give a thought to the
transitory and fleeting changes of life, never deeming
their turn of lowliness may chance. Few, indeed, in the
summer hour of wanton prosperity, dream of the wintry
storm that will follow in the uncertain course of human
existence. With grim and unbending frowns the haughty
burgomasters met the tearful eyes of the boy, upon whose
long dark lashes the heavy drops fell, as when the spray,
kissed by the morning breeze, showers the dews that the
night spirit weeps upon the sleeping flowers;he pleaded
to men, who, though in the common path of their duty as
burghers were kind and bore the reputation of religion
but who, filled with consequence and authority, were
rendered
cold and hardened as rocks on whose bleak sides
the ice of winter clings. Neither is such carelessness of
the miseries of a fellow creature, however inhuman,
confined
to the selfish breasts of Mienheers Filkins and
Verplanck
;
numbers, even in these times, who have the
reputation
of charity, who spend money to relieve the
unfortunate
of their species, to appearance liberally
forsooth
because they have taken the pains to let the world
into the secrets of their alms; and who thereby have
their vanity fed by public praise: yet they will grind the
poor debtor for the last shilling reserved to obtain bread,
and exult in his ruin and mourning. The burgomasters
unrelentingly repulsed the youth, and shook him roughly
and unceremoniously from their path.
Pize on ye, younker, this is uncivil of you to pester us
pughyou have had our answer, pugh, quoth Heer
Filkins
,
frappishly, as he strode away with an eager,
shuffling
pace, as anxious to be rid of Arnyte's importunities.
Ja! mannikindis is der nonschenze do geeb beobles
vor noding ven mien tinner is krowing gold, echoed
burgomaster Gelyn, and he drew his steps after those of
his worthy associatethe eyes of Arnyte followed their
departure with a look of reproachful bitterness.
And these, he murmured indignantly, are the men
my deluded and abused parent fostered and warmed in his
confidence, little recking that they followed him but for his
prosperity; these are the men that broke his bread and shared
his salt, and held his wine cup to their lips, and basked in
the smiles of his favour; and these he trusted, on such
as these he depended, nor dreamt of cold ingratitude.
Good heaven! am I deceivedam I within the pale
of
civilized men, and can these things be? But yesterday,
the losel that hangs about the palace gate, and watches
for the crumbs the menials throw into the street, and
worships as a deity the veriest varlet that spurns him,
was not more lowly and abject than these time serving
sycophants, who now cast me away in scorn, and tread
me down as though I were a worm fit but to be crushed.
Oh, were that yesterday to return! Alas, alas! our sun
is set, and these birds that wantoned in its beams, fly the
shade: he wrung his hands in anguish of spirit. And
it is in the hands of beings thus cold, frozen and
untouched
by human feelings, that my poor parent's destiny is
placed! what hope has he of justice? his unspotted
loyalty
his
noble, daring exertions for the revolutionhis
fortune spent in the Protestant causewill these not
avail against the machinations of his enemies? they must,
Vol. II. 17
they shall speak, (even should it come to that) with
trumpet tongue at the foot of the throne. And yet
relief
is distant, and I cannot bear to think on it;he
suffers
his
aged limbs upon the dank dungeon floorhis
wife, his son, his friends forced from his presence, nor
allowed
to share his sorrow. Great God! and I the cause!
I could have fled the pirates' den alone, and now this
Sloughter's mangled corpse had been food for the raging
wolf. And do I, shame on my lip that breathes the word,
regret saving a fellow creature from the murtherer's
knife? no! let what may happen that shall not be; the
very act done by these young hands shall plead even to
the gates of mercy, were they to seek his life. His life!
great God, his life!what have I saidmy father's life!
they will not, dare not attempt so foul a deed. Yet, their
hands are red with Milbourne's blood; but that was in
the moment of wild, ungoverned passion; reason was lost
and he was rash and quick of temper; but my father
is old, is mild, is kind, is gentle.No! the earth itself
would yawn, and swallow up the homicides that would
think on a crime so monstrous, foul and baseout on it!
the wild, mad thought doth fret me, and makes my heart
heat at my ribs in terror, and my pulses throb like those
of a chased and affrighted deer;still, still I cannot
quell these dreadful,fearful ideas that throng in horror
through my busy brain, and make me shrink from what
may come. He cast himself at length upon the nearest
bench, and pressed hastily his heated brows to the stone,
as if to gather relief from its coldness to his burning
temples
.
After a short interval of uneasy rumination, he
continued:Too surely men cannot be so utterly
abandoned to all faithso entirely regardless of every
ancient favour and friendship; there still must be some
who will venture limb, ere that which I dare not name
should happen:too sure they will not allow him to
perish without an effort, however desperate. If words
fail, why the sword,the sword remains. Alas! this is
but folly,the very error of a dream; Manning, the
vilest of traitors suffered not death, disgrace alone was
his portion. My dear parent hath done nought that
merits
ignominy or persecution; certain it is, severely would
their highnesses the king and queen visit on the heads of
the offenders their anger, did they but presume to touch
one hair of his revered headbut yet it is the wrath,
the frenzy of the present hour,the delirium, that hath
seized upon the minds of men and leads them
remorseless
,
pitiless and unthinking to rage like hungered beasts
of prey, and thirst for bloodthat makes me tremble:
great God! they have already had a taste of gore, and
Milbourne may not be the only victim of their sacrifice.
He broke off the sentence as if shuddering at the image
his own mind had conjured up, and then suddenly added
in a hurried and resolute voice, by heaven! I must,
I will see him, though I die in the attempt.
Who, in the devil's name, is it you want to see, and
what are you doing here, young one, when every body
else hath gone about their business? come, tramp;
take yourself off in a gliff; I am going to lock up; said
a harsh, coarse voice that sounded like the noise made by
the grinding of a ragged millstone, at the side of the
stripling, at the same time he was roughly seized and
dragged from the bench. Arnyte started on his feet and
turned towards the speaker; he was a tall, ill-favoured,
bony, muscular looking man, with heavy and clumsily
jointed limbs, and an unpleasant expression of
countenance
,
every feature of which savoured of cunning
malice and wickednesslarge, thick black eyebrows
overhung his small grey eyes, in which could be read
little
favourable to their possessor, for they were lightened
by that sinister expression alone that bespeaks at once
selfishness and insolence of power;a knotted
forehead
,
a long drooping nose with wide nostrils, a large
mouth, and a sallow complexion,formed a visage from
which ignorance, dulness and hard-heartedness only could
be presumed. From the attire and appearance of this
personage his calling was easily to be divined; he had on
a sad-coloured jerkin and doublet, with a leathern belt
round his waist, from which depended a huge bunch of
keys, most of which were of enormous size. He was
the provost marshal, or city jailer; at his back were two
assistants; one, a lank, thin, ugly, bearish looking fellow,
with large goggle eyes and beetle brows, and the other, a
stout, lusty, clownish lout; the one was armed with a
long steel-headed pike, while the other carried a number
of fetters, anklets and chains of iron.
Ah! is it you, burgomaster?said Arnyte,
forgetting
the unceremonious manner in which he had been just
used by the hands of this personage, as he perceived
who it was, and giving him the title which he had
formerly
been dignified with,for it is certain that the same
care in the ancient day was taken with all such ci-devant
characters of consequence as is done in the present, by
giving them or their relations some posts of profit; for it
is a hard thing to serve the public without pay, unless one
is rewarded at least with a dirt contract, or can in some
way get remunerated from the ever open pockets of the
grateful burghers;this was the prevalent idea of the
day, and the city was always well served; for if a street
was paved, a hill dug down, or the public wharves let, the
son, second cousin, uncle, or the burgomaster himself
undertook the matter; and although the stadt was
charged somewhat more than the things could have been
effected for by others, yet it is well known the dearer
the purchase, oftener the better goods; and then the
advantage was to be considered of having such matters
carried on under the immediate inspection of a father
of the Stadt, who of course, would take the greatest
charge, and exercise the most careful economy as
to the manner of the work, and the cost and
expenditure
.
Roelofsen Stoutenbergh, for such was the name
of the city jailer, when elected to the Vroedschap,
was somewhat stricken with povertyso much so, that
it is said it was a hard matter for him to muster up a
gabardine befitting his puissant situation; indeed his
rise was one of those singular freaks of fortune, which
assimilates to the elevation of a tailor or hatter, to the
rank of a general, or a baker to that of a mayor
several
singular instances of which marvellous chances,
have been the wonderment of the good burghers of Nieuw
Amsterdam; nevertheless Roelofsen, though very poor,
counted much on certain expectations from his
father-in-law
,
an old, rich, swearing, drunken gardener, of
Schakabanica; but he well knew it is long waiting for
dead men's shoes, so as soon as he got a chance of
getting
a snug place, he left the station of burgomaster, and
assumed the salaried place of the provost marshalan
office of considerable profit, as will be seen hereafter;
adjoined
to the regular income of which situation, he obtained
an order of the council, which allowed him certain
perquisites
of an extra nature, for conducting criminals to jail,
to the whipping post, the wooden horse, the cucking
stool, the transport ship, and the gallowshis profits,
particularly in the latter case, being oftentimes
considerable
,
as he was not only the receiver of the breeches
of the dead convict, but was his sole executor and heir;
and this last capacity, was not alone confined to such
instances
,
but numerous others could be enumerated,
wherein he exercised it by virtue of his station.
Ah, burgomaster, is it you! exclaimed Arnyte, a
beam of hope lighting his eyes, as he eagerly seized
the huge and reluctant hand of the provost marshal,
right glad am I to behold youfor in your power, lies
the granting of that which I seek, and for which, an you
extend your help to the afflicted and unfortunate, a
hundred
blessings will be showered on your head. My
father
,
Jacob Leisler, is in confinement under your charge
you cannot, be you a man, deny a child the sight of
his parent; allow me then, kind Mienheer, to have an
interview but for a few brief moments with himI ask
no more.
Umhave you an order to effect admission, from
any of the sitting magistrates? returned the jailer in a
growling tone, and coldly withdrawing his hand from the
tremulous grasp of the youth
Alas, no, they have refused me, sternly refused
me, answered Arnyte in a desponding voice.
Fico! young one, and did you believe I would let
you see the fish withouten order? umit can't be,
master
,
said the jailer gruffly.
For heaven's sake, good burgomaster, what harm
17*
can there be in such conference as I will hold with my
fallen and desolate parent?
There's so much harm, that I won't let you infico!
I won't do it, young one, so you'd best be off withouten
more words, replied the jailer short and testily.
Nay, Mienheer Stoutenbergh, quoth Arnyte
somewhat
warmly, his spirit rising at the obdurate and
insulting
bearing of the provost marshal, is Jacob
Leisler
one who hath coldly and unprovoked, embrued his
hands in innocent blood, and foully acted a deed of
wanton
murther, or who hath felon-like threatened the
existence
of his creature, for gold? Is he, I say, a
convicted
knave, stained with crimean outlawed villain,
who hath put to the defiance all human lawa
blasphemer
of his Maker, that he and his are treated thus
with contumely? I repeat it, Mienheer, you have those,
the vilest of mankind, the homicide and the robber, in
your custody, to whom more leniency is shown, than to
him, who, whilome, was your ruler.
Young one, I know my duty withouten your
teaching
,
quoth the jailer in reply, and advancing on Arnyte
with fierce and impatient gestures, come, no more ado,
nor wag that saucy tongue of thine so fastbut get thee
on thy waytroop, I say.
Sirrah! thou hast grown insolent with thy place,
and dost forget thyself too far, indignantly returned the
provoked stripling, the blood crimsoning with a warm
flush of ire, his cheek, and his veins swelling as the
angry
tide rushed through them, I tell thee what, sir
knave, this bearing towards me, doth ill become thee;
sooth! it is not so long, since you quitted the losel rags
of your birth, that you may perchance resume them; I
say you may live to repent your inhumanity.
Scarce had Arnyte, with proud and undaunted
confidence
,
uttered these imprudent words, when the jailer,
who had heretofore unloosened the keys from his girdle,
and had held them in his hand during the last speech,
and now stung to brutal passion by the youth's invective,
suddenly and violently struck the stripling in the face
with them, who, with a piercing shriek of agony, in an
instant sank down senseless on the stone pavement at
the feet of his savage oppressor, his blood gushing from
the wounds made with the iron weapons, and his eyes
and nostrils running a stream of gore, which welled
around his prostrate body.
That, malapert, will learn thee to be civil, said the
provost marshal, as with a ferocious scowl he bent over
his fallen victim. Here, Boele, continued he,
addressing
one of his attendants, take this audacious varlet and
throw him out of doors on the slip, where his kinsman
met his fate. These Leisler hounds were all an
impudent
race, it would not bring many tears from me did the
Aansprecker
[20]

The funeral messenger.
go his rounds for the whole set o' them
and hark thee, Boele, when thou hast done that job, close
this room while I look to the under wards, here's the
keys. So now Dolph you may bring along the bracelets.
Having thus directed, the provost marshal,
accompanied
by the assistant who carried the fetters, quitted the
apartment; spurning as he went, with ruthless and
unfeeling
unconcern, with his foot from his way his felled
and feeble antagonist; nor betraying in his unmoved and
sodden face the least pity or care as to the situation of
the rash boy, who had so incautiously brought on his
head his barbarous ire. The blow by which Arnyte had
been borne down was heavy and stunning, and if
deliberately
aimed would doubtless have been fatal; but though
the flesh about the forehead was bruised and torn, and
his visage was gashed and lacerated wherever the keys
had scattered when he was struck by them, yet his
insensibility
was happily but of short duration; for as he lay, a
sudden quickening of life came over him, and he felt a
hand busied upon his apparel. Recollection returned,
and the cold sweat that had bedewed his limbs died away
every sinew of an instant was braced, and with an
agitated
and convulsive motion, the effort of strength in
which apparently was beyond his years and delicate form,
he started on his feet. The first sound as he rose that
broke on his hearing was the rattling of something which
he seemed to have flung from him in rising; he dashed
aside with a hasty hand the clotted and gory locks that
blinded his eyes. On the floor from which he had
started
lay a piece of money, while at a pace's distance,
out-stretched
upon the pavement of the room, was the
provost
marshal's assistant, in whose charge Arnyte had
been delivered; the man had been cast in this prostrate
situation while busied in plundering the youth,
unexpecting
his sudden recovery. As Arnyte beheld the sullen
and disappointed glances with which the fellow eyed the
piece that had evidently escaped his clutches by the
unlooked
for movement, and saw the eager struggling which
shook his outstretched hand as he resumed his feet, for
the possession of the glittering metala dread of further
violence came over the mind of the stripling, which
increased
as he marked the threatening frown and surly
look with which he was gazed at.
Here, said Arnyte, taking up the dubbeltje and
holding
it out for the acceptance of the turnkey, while a hope
of winning him to his purpose ran through his mind,
here, take this good friend, and I will add to it a
zesthalven
,
which is all I have about meaye, nearly all my
ruined fortunes hath left since they have seized upon my
parent's homestead, and hold it in the crown's name.
Take it, good friend, and let me but pass to the dungeon
of Jacob Leisler; the man eagerly snatched at the
money
,
but hesitated on the request of the youth, who
strenuously
renewed his entreaties. Let me but pass, kind
friendlet me but enter his dungeonmy life shall be a
toil for you; my prayers shall be your reward; heaven
will bless you for the deed;yea, the memory of it shall
live in my breast until it is cold in the grave. I have not
perhaps wherewithal now to repay such kindness, but
depend
on it if I live you shall meet your deserts. There
are, there must be some who will extend their hands to
relieve the house of Leisler; and from them you shall
receive
that gold which I am unsupplied with: and should
it be, as well I hope, that my family is restored to its
former
consequence and possessions, I pledge myself this
favour
shall be among the first that return shall be given to
let me but pass, kind friend, and cheer him in his
lonesome
dungeon.
The fellow's resolution was apparently shaken by this
appeal, and after a moment's faint refusal his
determination
was entirely changed by the sight of the zesthalven,
which Arnyte drew forth and held in his hand, and he
consented to conduct him to his father's prison. Arnyte
overwhelmed him with thanks and promises, as with
cautious
steps he led him forth from the apartment to the
hall; when after commending him to silence, with a
stealthy pace they proceeded to mount the stairs that led
to the upper stories of the building. They were a wide
and heavy flight, with a clumsy balustrade, of which every
banister was carved, and was as thick as a man's arm.
On arriving at the top they came to a small and dark
entry
,
at the apparent end of which was a door of solid plank
studded with enormous nails, and braced and banded
with strips of iron; a chain was drawn across it on the
outside. Having undone this, and covering the large lock
as he opened it with his cloak, so as to deaden the
creaking
of the key while it turned, the guide unlocked an
inner
door or rather grating, and bid Arnyte enter, telling
him he must remain quiet within until after the rounds
had passed, when he would return and conduct him
without
the stadthuis walls; he then left him, carefully closing
and locking the doors after him as he departed. Arnyte
listened
for an instant to the harsh creaking of the lock,
which seemed to shut him in from the world, and looked
for a moment on the ponderous doors with an involuntary
shudder which he could not conquer, as it ran through
his frame; then with a sore heart he turned to the
dismal
abode of wretchedness and crime in which he had
entered, and prepared to meet the unfortunate Jacob
Leisler within the miserable precincts.
SECTION II.
I am so worn away with fears and sorrows,
So wintered with the tempest of affliction,
That the bright sun of your life quickening presence
Hath scarce one beam of force to warm again
My spring of comfort.
THE PRISON.
The place in which Arnyte now stood, was a hall of
considerable size, but which, though lighted by several
windows which looked on the slip that fronted the
building
,
wore a gloomy and heavy aspect, for, added to the
numerous bars and close gratings of iron, which
nearly covered the exterior of the windows on the
inside
,
the rays of day were rather obstructed than
helped
,
by casements composed of small panes of glass of
a greenish dye, dirty and discoloured, many of which
were broken or shattered, and their places supplied with
foul rags, and hats, and paper, and through the
remainder
of which, almost in vain, the sickly and feeble
sunbeam
of a wintry day, strove to pierce. The place
indeed
,
with its low dank walls, and massy architraves,
wore the funereal hue of twilight, and darkness was wont
to sit within the miserable den long ere the day beams
had faded from the heaven, and gave place to the thiop
visaged night; in spite, too, of its lofty situation, the air
of this prison was close, noxious and confined, and when
breathed, fell on the lungs with a feverish weight, while
the dampness of the season struck through the sides of
the building, and mingled with the unwholesome vapours
that hung around; ftid and stifling odours, and an
unnatural
heat, contended with the winter's cold. It was
a spot wherein health could not long exist, and but few,
except such wretches whom frequent crime had made
accustomed to its horrors, could live within its bounds;
and yet, withal, saith the tradition, that most veracious
of journals, the Post-boyits conductor, actuated by the
like motives with which his modern prototypes bepraise
and belard with flatteries every insect in office, was daily
superabundant and overwhelming with compliments on
the efficient, active and excellent burgomaster
Stoutenbergh
,
the keeper, for his exquisite management of the
prisonthe cleanliness, wholesome air, and decency that
reigned throughout; that the place was never well taken
care of, until the worthy burgomaster came in office, nor
were the convicts under his charge, ever better behaved
and that the latter case was not singular, considering the
mild temper, and manners, and kind humanity, which the
good Mienheer, the provost marshal, possessed. In truth
such was the circulation of these remarks of the
Post-boy
,
that many honest burghers, as they whiffed their
pipes over its sapient columns, were persuadedfor
even at present, there are many who consider all
avouched
in print, particularly in a public journal, as certain
facts, to be undisputed, that the tigthuis of Nieuw
Amsterdam
,
was preferable to their own fire sides, and
grumbled that the stadt enforced a stiver a head as taxes,
for the support of rogues and vagabonds like gentlemen
while the goed vrouws were profuse in admiration of
the generous hearted jailer, declaring he was worthy of
being made a deacon,and therefrom, burgomaster
Stoutenbergh became a member of a charitable society,
formed for the purpose of sending Dutch Bibles to the
poor ignorant paynims of Madagascarwho stood, as
the Dutch dominies asserted, in danger of being damned
for the want of the light of Revelation taught them, in
the sonorous and melodious hoogduitch taal; and
moreover
,
to confirm the truth of the suggestions in his favour,
as to his lenient behaviour towards his prisoners,
Mienheer
Stoutenbergh, once a year, received a visit from a
committee of the burgomasters, who, together with his
friend, of the Post-boy, (who from meddling with every thing,
acquired the reputation of importance, and thereby had a
standing invitation to all city entertainments,) after
having feasted voluptuously in the keeper's
department
,
at the cost, however, of the city, and having drank
Spanish wine and zwaar beir, until they were either blind
or saw things with a double sight, (which latter was no
uncommon case with double Dutch burgomasters,) gave
a cursory glance through the prison, which, in
expectation
of their presence, had been scraped and scrubbed and
white-washed for the first time that twelvemonth, and
which they always took care to report to the vroedschap
as in a satisfactory situation, adding that Mienheer,
the provost marshal, treated them to the best
Maaslandsley's
pipes they had ever smoked; and such reports being
ordered to be published, appeared thereafter at length in
the Post-boy, accompanied with the publisher's own
remarks
and advice on prison discipline, with which, like
every thing else, he conceited he was well acquainted;
after which, for the edification of his readers, he was
wont to give them a perusal of all the learned and
facetious
toasts drank by himself and the doughty members
of the stadt council on the occasion, his own being always
one pre-eminent for its wit and compliment to the
entertainer
and Joffer Stoutenburgh. However, at the time
that Arnyte looked upon the prison walls, the visit of
examination by the burgomasters had long been past, nor
was there an immediate expectation of another, and the
place was loathsome with dirt and filth and neglect. On
the side of the hall opposite to the windows were
entrances
to several small and darksome apartments, the
doors of which, as did every other thing about the place,
partook of a massiveness of structure, strength, and shape:
like the outer one of the hall, they were each cased and
bound with ribs and plates of iron, and almost lined with
large headed nails; a small square light, or rather grating
of cross bars, was in the centre of each of these doors,
some of which opening in an apartment where a
solitary
criminal was chained, were fastened and strongly
secured with a stout bar, or rather iron tongue, that
covering
the lock defended it from any attempt to force or
tamper
with it; the entrances of the other rooms were
unclosed
,
giving free communication with the hall, from which,
however, there was as little chance of escape or
departure
for its inmates, whose unhappy lot it was to be
confined
in this place without distinction of age, sex, or crime;
men and women, boys and girls, the young, the aged, the
sick, the dying, the innocent and the guilty, were thrown
together as it were in one mass to taint and corrupt each
other; the novice gathering from the black despair of his
own heart and the encouragement and example of his
companions, a taste and love for crimes, for which,
here-tofore
,
he had only felt remorse, was here alike condemned
and forced to drink in his sighs of sorrow, with the
malignant
and infected air of the prison. Beside the
regardless
and careless ruffian, whose knife but lately ripped
life from the breast of a fellow creature, and who seeks to
whisper, with many a sneering laugh at his moans, which
the assassin terms childish repentance, sentiments at once
profane and obscene in his revolting hearing, sits some
youth, whose only crime is the misfortune that he is
suspected
of guilt he never committed; here the felon and
the false coiner, hardened in vice and wickedness, are
glorying as they teach their trades of infamy, in their
wanton and lascivious lives to some attentive and emulous
listener, who as yet had been betrayed but in a single
error
;
the insolvent debtor, the drunken burglar, the
abandoned
prostitute, and the leprous beggar, were huddled
in the same neighbourhood, compelled to endure at once
their own misery and behold that of others. When
Arnyte
entered this den of grief and crime, here and there
only a straggling wretch was pacing the extent of the
place in moody silence, or scrawling with charcoal on the
wall, while at the farther end of the hall, as well as he
could discern through the clouds of smoke, which being
broken in their egress by double iron-gratings, that choaked
the mouth of the chimney, intended to prevent escape by
ascending its darksome and perilous passage, poured in
voluminous bodies in the prison, creeping with an avidity
for warmth to their shivering members, and gathered in a
heap of almost shapeless filth, the very vermin
engendered
by their own bodies, dropping around at every motion
Vol. II. 18
as they hung over one solitary stick of wood, their
allowance
for several hours, and which, green and wet,
scarcely
burnt, but smouldered to ashes, sat on the bare floor
four or five miserable beings, whose haggard, sickly, and
cadaverous looks, dim, sunken eyes, dishevelled hair,
and limbs, that but for a dirty blanket that was drawn
with feeble hand across their shoulders, would have been
naked, gave them an aspect of the most heart rending
despair, the effect of long severe sufferings and
protracted
imprisonment; but this disgusting show of hopeless
wretchedness was apparently not general, for from
several
of the adjoining cells, ever and anon broken out
horrible
execrations, heartless curses, and the wild,
discordant
notes of ribald song and of mirth and of laughter, while
in the dull or debauch-flushed countenances of one or two
of the walkers of the hall, could be traced an expression
of contented indifference and recklessness of fate; and
some wore in their apparel an air of comfort and even
some splendour of their past fortunes, which the mercy of
the keeper and his assistants permitted them to retain while
the prisoner could command such favour by the
contributions
of connexions or friends, who might still adhere to
him in unhappiness, or until the excellent Mienheer
Stoutenbergh
was thoroughly convinced he had extracted the
last dotkin, when both doublet and jerkin followed, and
the last remnant of worth was soon stripped from the
victim's
limbs, and he was forced to hovel with the most
squalid and the lowest, subject to the jeers and mockery
of his heretofore envious companions, (for jealousy
tyrannized
even in this miserable cavern, and various where
the vile arts and abandoned treachery practised often at
the expense of their fellows, with which the smile and
kindness of the brutal jailer, and even the most
insignificant
turnkey, were bought,) and the insults of those to
glut whose rabid avarice his all had been sacrificed.
Arnyte had scarcely crossed the door way, and had time
to survey the dismal scene before him, ere a man, who
stood idly leaning against the wall with legs carelessly
crossed, in an attitude of listlessness, within a few
paces of the entrance of the place, and having eyed the
youth for a moment with a sharp, quick, and inquisitive
glance of impudent curiosity or wonder, ejaculated with a
loud, squeaking, and unpleasant utterance, the words a
fish! a fish! Those near the speaker taking the sound,
turned their eyes upon the stripling and repeated the
slang words, which in an instant flew from mouth to mouth
to the extremity of the hall, and were reiterated as they
passed from the interior of each dungeon, from most of
which in a moment a motley throng poured forth
tumultuously
,
while the small gratings of the others were
crowded
with anxious faces and eager eyes which gazed with
different feelings of pleasure or derision upon the new
comer; indeed, for an interval, the most abject being in
the prison seemed to have his attention called from his
own cares and wo, as though to look upon a creature of
a different sphere, and it is hard to say, whether the
predominant
feeling with which they regarded the fresh
mate of their confinement, as they supposed the stripling,
was pity for his as yet unknown misfortune, that gave him
a share of their sorrow, or delight that they alone were
not sufferers, but that misery poured her vials on others;
that besides them there were those who were wretched
and outcast; in truth, their greetings might rather be
compared to the welcome with which devils would
receive
some fallen angel, or of the reception by the damned
of some lost soul, whose wickedness had numbered it with
their doleful ranks. It was with no little embarrassment
that Arnyte underwent the scrutiny of the ruffian and
unencouraging
glances that were bent so rigidly upon him,
and it was with timid and hesitating manner, and an
uncertain
and tremulous step that he approached and prepared
to address the person whose voice had first, in the strange
fashion related, announced his coming in the hall, and
who being the nearest he perforce sought to make
inquiry
at him of his imprisoned parent; neither was his
failing confidence greatly reassured but rather diminished
by the cold, calculating, sneering, and unfeeling cast of
countenance of this personage, whose features it struck
him were somehow familiar to him, and whose bearing
was such as to make him falter to apply to himthe
stature
of this man was naturally tall, but more from habit
than age his head sank forward on his shoulders, so that
although the whole body from this had attained somewhat
of a drooping posture, yet his shoulders appeared to set
straight and almost to rise above his ears; his limbs were
gaunt and fleshless, and his visage long, thin, and sallow
to such a degree that the skin fairly resembled the
darkest
parchment, having the same livid and deathlike hue;
his beard was grizzled and his eyebrows long and thick,
nearly overshadowing his small sharp grey eyes, which
were the only speaking feature he possessed, and in whose
quick orbs lurked cunning and roguery, and indeed every
evil passion of human nature; however, ere Arnyte could
muster up resolution to speak to this character, he
himself
was accosted by the prisoner.
How comest in the net, lad? quoth the man, with
an utterance at once shrill and disagreeable, while
Arnyte
,
from his peculiar countenance and voice, almost
instantaneously
recognized in the speaker one of that
desperate
gang of outlaws who prowled about the province,
confederate with the corsair Kid, in disposing of the
plunder
of his roving cruises, and whose chief employment at
other times was the passing of counterfeit coin; indeed
this was the very same man who hath heretofore been
slightly introduced in this narrative, and the youth
remembered
him as the one who but the night before, in
that forest wigwam, had been the first cause of the pirate
Loffe's mutiny against his vengeful leader, and who
having returned from that dreary place of rendezvous had
been seized on his first appearance in the city by the
hands of justice, which had been long watching to take
him, and he was now held to stand trial for some one of
the numerous crimes he had committedhis situation to
him, however, was a matter of little moment, he had
oftener been in greater danger, and had, either by
clemency
or fortune, escaped punishment, though deserving
its severest measure; and now he counted from the
peculiar
situation of the act for which he was confined, on
compounding the felony with Dirk Van Rikketie and his
worshipful associate, the king's attorney, who, in their
wisdom, many times considered they read the laws aright
if they punished the smaller rogues and pardoned the
greater; possibly fearful that in case they reversed the
plan their offices might become extinct for want of knaves
to try and condemn, and they thereby lose good livings
and rich salaries. As the memory of the man came o'er
him, a thrill of horror rushed through the quivering limbs
of the startled stripling, and he shrunk back as though
the deadly point of a naked dagger had been thrust to
stay him in his pathway, while the change of habiliments
which Arnyte had made since his restoration to his friends,
his face wounded with the conflict with the jailer,
together
with the slight notice in his servile capacity, that the
man had bestowed upon the boy, prevented a like
remembrance
upon his part. How comest in the net,
lad? said the coiner, without noticing the emotion of
him he spoke with, hast slit a basket, or dipt in
cognyac
,
youngster? or art one of Koby Barquier's
[21]

An Illustrative Idea
.Divers serious enquiries have I made on
the meaning of the words in the text, yet fruitless hath been my
attempts to discover the spirit thereof; nathless, the idea which I
am inclined from many reasons, to give credence unto, is that the
words are the appellatives of some noted highwayman and
freebooter
of the olden time; albeit, if so, I have not been enabled to
trace the precise spot where his lurking places were situate;
nathless
,
there goeth a tradition that the neighbourhood of the ancient
city wall (i. e. the place where Wall-street now is,) was sorely
infested
,
and of a verity, it hath always, yea, unto this day, been the
resort of many noted plunderers and suspicious characters.
T. P.
highbinders
?
though thou lookest green to handle a growler;
whose thy fence, lad? hast any o' thy bootle left from
the cuddies, say lad? I am an honest man you may
depend
on me, so let us go quips.
Having spoken thus he stepped close on the youth,
and very unceremoniously prepared, after slapping him
familiarly on the shoulder, to run his hand over the
stripling's
jerkin, and to examine the contents of his pockets;
but Arnyte, who, during his captivity with the marauder,
had before heard the slang used by the coiner,
understood
sufficient of his expressions, to perceive that the
fellow took him for a thief or a vagabond, who, by his
actions, he deemed was yet young in the business, and
whom he could therefore pilfer of his spoil with
impunity
and
18*
so assuming courage from the alarming motions
of the man, Arnyte abruptly shook the coiner from him.
I am not what you take me for, master, said he
somewhat haughtily, I am not your fellowI have
admission
here to see Mienheer Jacobus Leisler, who, I
am taught, is here prisoned; an you like to do a
favour
,
conduct me to his presence. As Arnyte uttered
this, the whole terror of the prison, and the idea of his
father's endurance of the ignominy and wretchedness of
such a place, burst at once on his mind with electric
force, superseding all other thoughts, and he felt nigh
sinking to the earththough great God! continued
he, while his lips quivered with anguish as he spoke,
they cannotthey have not dared to lodge him in this
horrible dena place unmeet for humanity. It will
kill himoh! it will kill him.
On my reputation, lad, quoth the coiner, as he
drew back from Arnyte and gazed on him with a sharp
and inquiring look, troth, it must be a man of little
spirit, that would give in to death for the sake o' the
place, though our bread be none of the whitest here,
and our broth be of bones that a starved dog would loathe
the gnawingthe liquor blacker than an African's skin;
yet one should make the best on it, though an it like
you, here he dropped his voice to a whisper, and
brought his mouth almost to the ear of Arnyte, first,
however, having cast a hurried glance around him, to see
that none was near enough to catch his words, though
an it like you, pursued he, to let me have your knife,
or mayhap you may ha' brought a file, or the like, an so,
give it here quickly, and warrant me, ere to-morrow,
yon sturdy locks of iron shall fly loose at my bid, as an the
doors were held by a straw wisp; the best stone shall
rise from its seat in the wall, while the mortar shall roll
on the floor, like crumbs for the feeding of birds: do
you take me, lad? what say ye? I mean for old Leisler's
vantage, on my reputationso let me have a schilling, to
get some blackstrap of master Stoutenberghblast it,
my throat is parching for a dram.
At the first moment, the idea of liberty to his father,
although so strangely conveyed, made the heart of
Arnyte
bound joyously within him, and he drew his breath
thick with hope; he unthinkingly was about to grasp with
cagerness the hand of the coiner, and express his
heartfelt
gratitude for the offer of the criminal, and pledge
his own co-operation to perfect the object, when, as he
looked in the man's face, whether in thought or reality,
he could scarce for the instant determine, he perceived a
slight quivering of the upper lip, and a momentary
contortion
,
as of a sneer, ran through the features, while
something like derision lurked in the corners of the
villain's
busy eyes; the expression, however, instantly died
awaybut it had recalled recollection to the youth's
mind; the profligate character of the ruffian, the
singularity
and the suddenness of this last addressand there
was something certainly in the manner, so he persuaded
himself, of the man's disusing his slang terms, and
particularly
,
in thus unbosoming himself to one who was
apparently an utter stranger to the fellows. All these
struck him, that the coiner was but sounding his own
purpose, to fathom his intentions whether there was a
plan on foot for his father's escape, and what was likely
if such had been(for he had heard of persons equally
base, in like times,) after having wormed himself in the
secret for his own benefit or pardon, that he might
hasten
to betray his confiding companion. Indeed the
criminal's bearing, was not that of a person whom
Arnyte
could have trusted, or for a moment have depended
on. He therefore hastily proceeded to repel the man's
unwelcome advancesand the coiner, soon disappointed
in whatever he might have been aiming at, and seemingly
offended, withdrew, with a menacing brow and
threatening
eye, from the side of the stripling, and walking off
joined a small group of his fellow prisoners, whom he
quickly engaged in a converse which was carried on in a
low voice, while judging from their gestures, and the
frequent glances cast in the direction he moved, Arnyte
was evidently the object of their discourse.
Being thus freed from the company of this dangerous
acquaintance, undisturbed by the other tenants of this
gloomy region, (for, having satisfied themselves with
gazing on the stranger of their dwelling, some withdrew
to the sports wherewith they had been quelling the
weariness
of imprisonment, or to the employment of their
sad reflections, while those who remained near the
youth, refrained from intruding themselves upon his
notice
,
possibly withheld by the idea that either the coiner,
who was well known by every rogue as a rare hand,
had already stripped the bird of all that could be got, or,
that from the last mentioned worthy's sudden retreat,
the pigeon was not worth the plucking,) he advanced
further in the place, but with slow and reluctant pace
yet when he looked in the nearest cell, and viewed with
eye of grief, and heart moved by the sight, at once to
tenderness and pity, indignation and detestationwhen
all the strange confusion, and the degradation of human
nature burst upon him that the horrid dungeon
exhibited
,
he paused for strength to bear it, ere he inquired
for his parent, while the wish rushed strongly on him,
that he had been deceived and misled by the keeper's
assistant, and that he was mocked with the idea that
Jacob
Leisler was an inhabitant of this hell of guilt,
infamy
and misery, or anywise a partaker of its frightful
recesses. Within the close, dank, and narrow corners
of this dreary hole, (and even such epithet, can scarcely
convey an idea of the loathsomeness of aspect of these
caverns, the confines of the largest of which, could not
have exceeded seven feet in the measure of length or
breadth,) from eight to ten wretched objects, in the
shape of living creatures, were crowded together as
it were, wallowing like beasts in some noisome
penthouse
:
the flickering ray of light that stole into this
dismal apartment was rendered more obscure and
dim by means of the obstruction of a filthy, ragged
mat that hung before the inner casement, so that
darkness, to eyes unaccustomed to pierce its misty
bounds, clouded the farther nooks and corners of the
place. Neither table, chair, bench, nor stool, nor any
other necessary utensil for the comfort of life, was to be
seen: the bare, hard plank of the prison floor served the
inhabitant of this dungeon at once whereon to crouch, to
sit, and to eat fromand fortunate was the wretch, and it
was with difficult and unceasing guard and watch that he
retained them from the envious and greedy hands of his
fellows, if the hardness of his bed was relieved by a thread
worn and leprous looking blanket, or a small bundle of
long used and dirty straw. Upon the rugged walls
horrible
and disgusting caricatures and figures were drawn;
words and couplets of grief, religion, and revolting
obscenity
were confusedly sketchedhere the trembling hand
of some repentant sinner had relieved the heavy burden
of his overwrought conscience by some melancholy verse
while there the immoral and unconscious libertine had
scrawled a memento of the bagnio or the gambling house.
Armies of rank and poisonous spiders laboured at their
intricate meshes on the low and dusky ceiling; nor was
there absent from the den a nauseous insect or abhorred
thing that in its atmosphere could live. The venomous
rat there had his nestthe brown backed roach and each
creeping vermin that loves putridity, in hordes wandered
about it undaunted, crawling on the flesh and infesting
the garments of the prisoner.
Of the inmates of this place, Arnyte discerned one, a
very skeleton, stretched at length upon the floor,
evidently
too enfeebled to arise from his recumbent position;
his attenuated and emaciated limbs were horrible in rags
and nakedness, covered with corrupt and sickening sores,
around which, as about the carcass of a carrion, huge
maggots were wantoning; passive he lay, stirless and
unmoving
as already a corse, with features ghastly and
withered: and had it not been for now and then a low
and painful moan that heaved his bosom as it would have
burst it, a slight shiver as of coming death that shook the
fragile frame, he might have been taken for a body from
which the spirit had long departed, and which was cast
in that charnel vault unheeded, to rot and be consumed;
for Arnyte was too far from him to mark the quivering
lip, the beaded drop that stood upon the brow, or the big
tear that ever and anon made its way from the dim, half
closed eye, that bespoke a mind too much disturbed to
reck of outward wo, and to which the grave were alone
relief. But a pace or two distant from this last most
wretched creature, were two men widely different from
him but now described; they were seated on a heap of
chains, which fastened to an iron staple in the centre of
the floor, were locked at one end by separate anklets
round a leg of each of these criminals, and so held them
in companionship. The dress, looks, and character of
bearing of these were desperate and ruffian like; they
were engaged in gambling, and regardless of the dying
situation of their neighbour, they at times made the
dungeon
roof ring again with their obstreperous peals of
laughter, oaths and curses, or discordant quarrels. The
complexion of the one who was apparently the most
abandoned
of the two, was of a sandy hue,high cheek bones,
light hair, reddish whiskers and mustaches, with light
blue eyes, scarcely marked by a brow, formed his
abhorrent
visage. This man was condemned for murder, the
commission of which had been attended with the most
atrocious brutality. The other was one of those wily
villains, of whom there were at the time numbers, who
for the sake of plunder or revenge upon some enemy,
had complotted with the black slaves to rise and fire
some dwelling and slay its tenants. This wretch had
been a preacher, and by that means wormed himself into
the confidence of the ignorant and unsuspecting for his
own purpose. He was now under the dreadful sentence
so common in the annals of the province for punishment
of his class of crime, and particularly resorted to in after
years in the execution of the ringleaders of the great
negro
conspiracy; he was to be placed in an iron cage,
which was to be hung from some lofty tree or gibbet, and
left for the wild and carnivorous birds of heaven to feast
on; bread was to be placed in his sight, but which his
load of chains would prevent him from reaching; all men
were forbid to yield him help under pain of a severer
penalty
:
and yet such was the recklessness of this hardened
and unrelenting creature, though but a brief space
intervened
ere the commencement of his sufferings, whether
alive to the reality of his situation for which there was no
hope seemingly of escape, or whether with courage braced
to a carelessness of his approaching fate, he scarce
appeared
to heed it with a thought, but plunged in all the
blasphemy, revel, and wild wassail of the prison house.
On the ear of Arnyte the profanity of the dissolute
grated harshly as thunder claps, and struck terror to his
very soul; and the groans and sighs of the sorrowful fell
heavily on his heart, which sickened within him; while
tears of pity hung upon his eyes at the endurance of the
fearful sight of the afflictions of the tenants of that direful
abode. The heart rending spectacle of one group in
particular
moved his every latent feeling of grief and
tenderness
:
this was a mother and her children; the miserable
parent with agonized impatience sought to still the sad
and querulous lamentations of a cadaverous and sickly
looking infant, which she supported in her feeble arms,
while more she strove to lend each moment to the
squalid
babe, (which though hideous from suffering in other
eyes, appeared lovely in hers,) a further portion of her
own scanty raiment to shield it from the searching cold
while at her knees clung two others of her hapless
offspring
,
half clad, though revolting to behold with the
filth of neglect; these with beseeching looks and visages
sunk with famine, were demanding food for existence,
from their unfortunate parent, who had already yielded
the mouldy prison crust, her day's allowance, to their
unsatiated
hunger; and now only she could answer their
cries with a wild and despairing look, in which, terrible
to relate! anguish was mixed with the madness of
inebriety
!
The offence of that doating mother was infanticide
the blood of one of her own children slain in
drunkenness
yet reeked upon her hand.
Faint, and stricken with pity and horror, Arnyte slowly
turned his eyes from the sight of infamy and
wretchedness
;
he was at once overwhelmed by the terrific scene
and his own dreary reflectionsfor a moment he gasped
for breath, and could hardly sustain himself from falling
to the floor; and it was a minute or so ere he could
recover
resolution and firmness enough to pursue the course
of his adventure. As he was about moving onward with
a determination to prosecute his search, and to learn at
once the worst of the condition of his father, he was
addressed by a person who for some little time past had
been, with a peering scrutiny, employed in regarding his
actions and vivid emotions; this was an aged and
venerable
looking man, whose locks were like some circlet of
snow that crowns a wintry mountain top; the expression
of his countenance, with the exception of his eye which
was slightly defective, was not unfavourable; and his body
bent beneath the weight of years. About his dress too,
which though whole was extremely threadbare, there
was a degree of cleanliness and neatness remarkable for
the place and his own situation. He had a peaked and
grizzled beard, trimmed in the fashion of the nobility and
courtiers of a century past, and his trunk hose was in the
Flemish taste of an ancient date; his fingers were
covered
with numerous rings, which though of glittering cast
by being retained by their owner from the hungry grasp
of his fellow prisoners, must have been valueless; while
ornaments of the like material and shape depended from
his ears. But however, there was something ridiculous
that injured the respectability of appearance of this
personage
,
in the mock importance, gravity, and dignified
carriage with which he bore himself; which though
befiting
some Spanish grandee amid his serfs, was totally at
variance with all character of an inhabitant of the
rasphuis
of Nieuw Amsterdam.
My son, quoth the ancient with a decorous and
solemn
enunciation, and with the sedate and majestic
bearing
of a sage speaking to his disciple, but which sober
manner could scarce be relied on whether as jest or
earnest
from the contradictory, or rather arch and wanton
roll and leer of the eye whose fault has been mentioned, and
which at the same time with one expression was
apparently
lowering on the person he was engaged with, and
with another was jocosely eliciting the attention of such
as listened to the parlance, my son, said he, you are
if appearance speaketh truly, a novice in this our
monastic
seclusion; and though the saw hath ittrust not looks,
for a still surface covers deep water,yet it giveth me
pleasance to greet thee, for your countenance speaks not
of evil, and as the Latin proverb expresses it, nemo
turpissime
subito est. This is a sad home to crouch in, young
man: nathless why mourn, Diogenes was contented in
a tub; yet you will say Diogenes was a cynic, and you
are none. But look to Platodoes he not in his
inimitable
Phedron give you an example of true contentment
and philosophy? Remember, young man, the divine
Socrates in his dungeon. With what equanimity did
Seneca
bear the persecutions of a tyrant; and what were
the feelings on this head of Strato, Pythagoras,
Anaxagoras
,
and Democritus. Do you take my advice? grey
hairs should be listened to with reverence; when you
have seen as much of the world as I have young man, you
may speak of your knowledgefor experience is
knowledge
.
You are going to remind me of your misfortunes;
true, but what are misfortunes? nothing. Look on me,
young man; my father-in-law was Abraham Isaacs Plank,
to whom Governor Kieft sold Pauleus Hoek for four
hundred
and fifty guilders Holland, on the first day of May
1638.

And mark me, young man, that is not all; this
very building stands on his ground, which ran a mile from
this placeyet I am kept from my right by power, and I
am now held my body in vile durance for a few paltry
stivers
of costs, although the heir of wealth enough to buy
half Rotterdam. But I have appealedmy case is carried
before the judges at Westminster; and mark me, young
man, you are in that which you may live to see turned
into a palace that shall outdo Hampton Court or
Whitehall
as my residence. Do you take my advicefret not,
but bear the peltings of the storm of fate without repining
for in what consists true philosophy but in making up
one's mind for a time to bear the worst. Can you find a
reason against my axiom, young man,do you take my
advice? you should not hunt for reasons, but remember
what Aristotle taught according to the report of Sextus
Empiricus, `posthabito in sensu quaerere rationem.'
This singular discourse was heard by Arnyte with
astonishment
,
and he gazed with wonder on the speaker,
scarce knowing what construction to put on his
eccentricity
.
Vol. II. 19
At times he could not restrain an involuntary
shudder that with a throbbing of alarm and sorrow mixed
beat at his heart, as he supposed this personage was one
of those lost beings whose mind, in the blasting conflict
of its powers, occasioned by an accumulation of
misfortune
past human endurance, had become partially
wrecked
,
and sense had sunk under the burthen of misery;
but yet there was in contradiction to this idea of
derangement
a placid, quiet, and orderly demeanour, and a system
or connexion in his speech: yet again so wild and doubtful
were the expressions he used relative to his own
imprisonment
,
that apparently such beacons of saneness were
but like watch fires on a dreary midnight coast, serving
to warn the mariner from encountering its dangers,
darkness
,
and desolationthey were but signs that there was
a method in his madness. So thought the stripling, and he
strove with impatience to disengage himself from one whose
words served no purpose but delay, and thereby added
new torments to the fever of anxiety that oppressed his
fretted heart. Distracted with dismal fears as to the
parent
for whom he was in search, he eagerly sought in
several
attempts to utter the smooth words which hung
upon his lips, to sooth that which he deemed the
irritation
of the person who had thus directed his speech to
him, and to free himself from his company; but his
endeavours
were fruitless, the sage was not so easily to be
shaken off, neither would he allow utterance to ought that
seemed to interfere with the purport of his parlance;
and he was truly dogmatical in retaining his unwilling
listener
,
for having griped him firmly by the sleeve lest he
should escape him, and in spite of the twists and jerks
with which ever and anon his hearer strove to loosen the
hold by which he was bound, and all unmindful of the
distressed attention with which his prolixity was received,
he pertinaciously continued to persevere in the motley
tenor of his speech.
Young man, pursued the philosopher, do you take
my advicethough an I rede ye aright, you possess all
the frenzy of youth, and scorn with hasty rashness the
caution of greybeards: yet what I tell you none can
gainsaythere are worse places than this on the earth,
and where you may suffer more; yet possibly you may
argue, male pericolosam libertatem quam quietum
servitium
however,
you have not yet seen as much of the
world as I have; or bad as it is, (and but little can be said
in its favour) you might be able, even in this prison
house, to find something to like and prefer to that wide
and bustling globe of which Balbus speaks so well, `nec
majus, nec melius mundo;' you should not despise that
which I say unto you on account of the plight and
situation
I am in at presentmark my words young
man, the durance which I now undergo shall be viewed
with horror hereafter, and you may live to see
pilgrimages
to my dungeon in honour of him who is now here
before you. Remember Galileo's prison, what but
ignorance
was the cause of his persecution, and what is it in
my case but envy? however, let me but recover my right
let me but once get the Plank property, and young man
you shall see that which shall surprise you. I will not
mind money where I find meritdo you take my advice
young man, and I trust it is not the admonition of a stoic
I feel for my fellow creatures, even amid the
ungenerous
treatment I have received at their hands, I have been
labouring for their good; yes young man, in this place have
I discovered the arcana, the grand secret of being, the very
alchemy from which existence is derivedthe height of
human inventionthe perpetuam reithe philosopher's
stonethe true grand secret of lifethe alembic, before
the trial of which every other vessel of chemistry fails! but
young man, this is inviolable between us; take my advice
and you may become a disciple to one who shall in time
have a name equal to Xenophanes Colophonius, the very
founder of the philosophy of ethics. You have youth on
your side, and you may one day be a Permenides, a
Melissus
,
or a Zeno Eleates. I will open my mind to you on this
matter at large hereafter, but at present I will follow the
example of those ancient naturalists, Empedocles,
Anaximenes
and Heraclitus, who in the words of the learned
Bacon, `mentem rebus submiserunt,' therefore until
fitting
time I will drop the matter, so bridle your desires;
for to restrain our passions, to command ourselves, is the
first great step marked out for the philologist and
philosopher
without
such power one is but an onsophist. But
to branch from this subject; you know the foundation of
my claims to the lands of 'Brom Plank, do you not think I
must recover? law, right, every thing are with methe
blind decision made on the subject already doth not test
the points of the case: for instance, what can be more
plainold Abraham Isaacs Plank bought of Governor
William Kieft, and was seized in fee tail on the first day
of May 1638, of certain lands, messuages, and tenements
situate at Paulus Hoek and in the city of Nieuw
Amsterdam
.
Now old Plank had two daughters, Gollotje and
Marie; Marie died intestate, so her right fell to the next
of kin, who was Gollotje; her first husband was Luyckes
Tienhoven, by whom she had lawful issue. Now mark
me, young man, I am Gollotje's second husband, and
guardian
to her children, and therefore by right of marriage
heir to the Plank estate; now adverse possession is held
of that estate by certain persons, who set up title as they
affirm by right of purchase, and pretend to show old
Plank's deed therefor: but mark my words, young man,
he never gave a deed; my wife says she can swear to that
factbut they would not receive her evidence; only
think of thatdamn my cap, only think of that, they
would not take my wife's oaththe deeds are forgeries
I know itold Plank never put his hand to parchment
he was a real cautious old Dutchman, too shrewd for
that. Such proceedings, such law as I have had is
enough to try one's patienceenough to make one
blaspheme
;
but I never swear except when I am in a passion,
and I flatter myself I am too much above the cares of this
world to get ever in a passion about any thing: but only
to think, young man, they would not take my wife's oath
however I have appealed
To what further duration the old man would have
spun his untiring theme, is scarce to be determined; for
there seemed neither bound nor medium in his discourse,
the very frenzy of which was apparent in its
protraction
,
which grew in rapid changes, from the strange
and fickle ideas that shifted alternate in his unstable
mind, while with grave deportment, his lips seized and
ushered forth, every wild thought that for a moment
prevailed paramount in his disturbed brain. His
condition
was truly such as of the many doubtful maniacs,
who, harmless in a manner, to all, except such as whose
time and patience they engross with the rehearsing of
speculative fancies, are suffered to roam at large,
rendering
their infirmity at most times visible, by their
ridiculous
conceit in forwarding their own learned
qualities
,
plans and projects on public endurance, to the
exclusion
of matters of more moment;I mean that class
of personages, who, blinded to reality, and opinionative
as to their own powers, deem themselves, in their own
idea, persons of considerable consequence; and
therefore
,
presuming that they are of equal importance in the
eyes of every body, and that their affairs are those of
the world at large, they believe they have a right to
demand
of others, to suspend all business until they are
possessed of their personalities and own immediate
concerns
.
Indeed the manner of the ancient, wherewith
he confined the service of the wearied and half angered
youth, partook much of this last feeling; and, albeit, he
would not suffer him the chance of speech, yet he would
not allow (such was the sage's greediness of attention)
his hearer's eye to wink from the subject on which he
debated, or his diligence of listening, to relax for an
instant
,for
whenever he perceived the visage of the half
distracted stripling turn from him with vexation and
impatience
,
with a sudden and pettish clutch at the boy's
gabardine, he would command his heed to the
outpourings
of his inexplicable theories. Happily, however,
for the relief of the distressed Arnyte, at the moment
when the philosopher (from the failure of whose breath,
which was of apparently an unrelenting source, and to
the giving out of which, to his helpless captive, for such
the youth might truly be accounted, there was no hope
of rescue) had pronounced the latter words, which is
above narrated, his further perambulation of speech
was prevented, by the interruption of to him, doubtless, an
19*
unwelcome intruder. The appearance of the person
who now made himself a party to the scene, by
thrusting
himself unceremoniously between Arnyte and his
tormentor, was singular, and in somewise differed from
that of most of the tenants of the prison house: he was
a man of the middle height, of a dark and foreign
aspect
,
a body shriveled, dried, and withered to the very
boneand his dusky complexion, in no way lessened
by an unshorn beard of the blackest hue, while from his
person and flesh, every appearance of cleanliness was
absent: round his head, instead of a night cap, was
twisted, in an ungainly fashion, a dirty and soiled
handkerchief
of an eastern figure, the brightness of whose
once vivid and flaring colours, was now departed and
lost 'mid stains and filth: he had carelessly wrapped
about him, an old, faded, flowered, damask morning
gown, lined with silk that might have once been green,
but in which now, varied streaks of yellow and blue,
contended with its original die. Through the opening
folds of this, could be discovered a tabbinet waistcoat,
edged with high wrought lacebut the filthy condition
of this garment, equalled that of the other portions of
his dressthe whole of which, to the well worn velvet
slippers, was sprinkled with divers gouts of that delicious
powder of the Indian weed, wherewith each moment,
his fingers fed with plenteous kindness, his huge nostrils
nathless, not unmindful in smearing therewith his
upper
lip, on which, many stray particles lingered at each
replenishmentso that at a short distance, it might have
been supposed he wore a huge, untrimmed mustache:
between
his lips he held a merschaum, or smoking tube, of
Belgian manufacture, from the pipe of which, he
devoured
with such avidity the essence of the herb it
contained
,
that even while speaking, he forbore to withdraw
it from his mouthso that his natural broken accent and
language, was rendered thereby even more unintelligible
and thick and husky.
Mon sacre dieu, misericorde, for vy you persecuter
dis pauvre garcon vid votre absurdit, Monsieur Isaaq?
exclaimed the stranger, as he intervened his person
between
the sage and the suffering victim of his
tediousness
,

By the light of philosophy, Jean Beartie, this is
provoking
,
quoth the sage, with a voice somewhat
deformed
with petulance in replication. Damn my cap, Jean,
but you are the most troublesome, ignorant and officious
fellow, in the ward; here I was particularly engaged with
this young man, who is not like you, but a sensible youth,
and listens patiently to maxims of wisdomand I am
well willing to render him the assistance of my mature
experience, in the paths of his improvementfor what,
saith the learned Bacon, is the trite adage of the Roman,
but that one cluster of grapes ripeneth best beside
another
?
and beatius est dare quam recipere,but why
need I explain to thee, whose mind is of the baser
metal, and who holdest to the poor maxim of the poet
Pindar, that water is the bestyet nathless, it is well
for one like me, that by the like of thee, huguenot, I am
persecuted, teased and pestered: yet I am a meek man,
a suffering patient man, as well becometh that which I
have studiedand I have borne from the vulgar, until it
may be said of medo you mark my wordstu ne cede
malis sed contra audentior ito.
Mesericorde! mesericorde! Monsieur, mon ami,
returned Jean Beartie, with a significant shrug of the
shoulder, and a potent application of sustenance to the
nostril, mon dieu! for vy you go off vid de grand

Damn my cap, can it be possible! cried the
ancient
like one thunderstruck, and with an unaccustomed
brevity of speech.
Cest possible, Monsieur mon ami, cest vrai as dat is
the promise of le grand monarque ou le Duc de
Bouillon
,
said the huguenot with the utmost indifference,
cramming his nose with the food for which it was
apparently
at all times hungered, and of which, no quantity,
however large, seemed unacceptable.
Damn the knave, I'llI'llno matter, this is the
ingratitude
of manbut I must bear itbut to think, I put
my soup, my bread, so nicely away for to-nightdeath
and destraction! has he devoured it all? cried the
vexed
philosopher, forgetting both his precepts and his
stoicism
in his perplexity.
I vill no be certain of datnon, nonmon amije
voir him at votre souper ven I leave de chambreune,
non, nondeux littel minute dat is pass, Monsieura ha!
en verite! answered Jean, at all times using a hundred
strange grimaces and convulsive contortions of
countenance
,
whereby at each breath, he eked out the meaning
he was scarcely capable of expressing, by his limited
knowledge of the language he attempted, to convey his
sentiments.
The enraged philosopher waited to hear no more
but unmindful of his intended disciple, and even of
gravity in his deportment at departure, he burst away
with an air of vengeance, towards his cell, leaving his
companions, as befitted the extremity of the occasion,
without further word.
A ha, ma foi! dat man hav de littel love at him

Jean Beartie, with a sly grin and lift of the shoulders,
as he cast his eyes after the ancient, mon dieu, him

You are much in error, quoth Arnyte calmly,
I, my good sir, am not in the situation, or of the
character
you supposebut indeed, I am an unhappy, an
unfortunate youth; and it is only the idea there
are others more dear to me than myself, who are
suffering
worse than it is my lot, that keeps me up against the
power of my evil fortune. I am the son, the only son,
now alas, living, of Jacob Leisler, so late powerful in
this province; but now, a deserted prisoner, pining in
grief, much I fear me, in this dreary, horrible place.
Mon dieu! je comprendez vousmon petit bonne

All that I have power will I extend in return for
your promised kindness, good friend, said the stripling,
but an you would fill the measure of your charity even
in the onset, at once conduct me to the dungeon of my
parent; I pray you proceed.
Je voir der attachement dat der fil hav vor votre
fader, bon, a ha, en verite, said the huguenot, thrusting
with many contortions of visage, his hand well plenished
to his nose, vat Jean Beartie say is vrai, no lie, ma
foi.
I prithee, kind sir, dally not with my impatience, but
lead me to my father's presence.
The Canadian, however, seemed to linger, somewhat
expectant of something more passing between him and
the stripling, ere he listed in his service; but perceiving
the inattention to whatever was the subject of his
thoughts manifested by the anxious youth, and possibly
unwilling from hopes of future benefit, to offend his new
acquaintance, after a disappointed shrug, in which his
head and body nearly met, and a long recourse to a
frequent
and accustomed solace, which he generally derived
from an extra supply to his devouring nostrils of the
vivacious
powder, on which he seemed as it were alone to
exist, he bade the youth follow him, and proceeded
towards
the farthest end of the hall; while the manner with
which the huguenot bore himself as he went, attracted
the attention of him whom he conducted; who gathered
from the man's behaviour more than from words, that he
was in higher favour with the keeper and his satellites
than his fellow prisoners; and that he was endued with
some authority over the hapless tenants of the hallfor
at almost every step the caitiff took he exercised the
utmost
insolence of petty tyranny upon some haggard
wretch, who was even in appearance deserted by
friendship
,
influence, and hope; while again, with all the
fawning
hypocrisy of the sycophant, he greeted others,
perhaps
without regard to crime, but rather means of
purchasing
his favour and as they stood with his masters, with
speech fair and kind. Truly this man was one of that
class of criminals who are singled out, chosen for their
apt and genial disposition by the keepers of prisons, to
serve their vilest views, as well as to further their brutal
cruelty. A convict himself, he was so situated as to
worm himself in the confidence of his fellowsto dive
into their views and plans, and then in spite of oath,
word, or conscience, or aught terrible and sacred even
with the worst of men, he would hasten to report all
except
such as he concealed more for his own interest, to
the keepers, who encouraged his villany, and rewarded
him therefor with privileges they withheld from any other
in the prison house: and with persecutions severe and
inveterate against such as he disliked, to forward which
his reports were most times aided by fictions of his own
coinage rather than what really chanced, he was like one
of those last ravens who hover at a distance over the
slain, and watch until the ban dog and heath fox have
banquetted their fill, ere attempting to descend and pick
the remnants of flesh and feed upon the nearly bare bones
of the deadwhich in this feast become peeled to very
nakedness.
Having approached the last of the range of cells, the
Frenchman pointed it out as that wherein Leisler was
confined. Dere, mon fren, mon petit Monsieur, said
he, allez vous et que dieu vous conduisse, donnez
consolation
pauvre pereah misericorde! Je voir votre
visageit no look like consolation, ma foi! wid der sang,
de rouge blood all over of him. Mon dieu! how com
dat? you combattez, a ha? Je comprend; den I vipe him
in von littel minute, you sall see, a ha, cest vrai; so
saying
he took the end of his morning gown, which was by
far the most filthy looking part of the garment, and
before
Arnyte could refuse the intended kindness, he ran it
over that part of the youth's face which was daubed with
stains of gore, the marks of the blow received from the
hand of Mynheer Stoutenbergh; dere, you no see him
one littel bit pour I'honneur de Provence, continued the
huguenot, him blanc as der fluer de lisle of le grand
monarque; ma foi! mon petit garcon allez vous a pauvre
pere. Jean Beartie no can go vid, him must garde de
gentilhomme in der salle. Ven you fader don vid you,
you call Jean Beartieyou comprend? den he com, a
ha! cest vrai; as is de promise le grand monarque ou le
Duc de Bouillon.
As Arnyte paused before the dungeon of his father, he
scarce recked the words spoken by his conductor, but his
eye busied itself in search for the revered form, in its
darksome recesses, with glances wild, and rapid as those
with which the wood-pigeon regards the movements of the
fowlerThere is no passion that debases the more
generous
sentiments of the human frame, and brings the finer
feelings of mankind to the very level of brutality, and
gives greater scope for display of the savageness of our
nature, than of that seated hatred which hath its rise
from political enmity, particularly when chance grants
power to extend its venom on such as heretofore hath
soared upwards and baffled (with fortune at their side)
every evil wish: in the conqueror's treatment of Leisler,
that demoniac feeling of ever pursuing revenge was most
apparent by the manner and place of his confinement;
the object was easy to be perceivedit was to bring
down to degradation and contempt in the eye of the world,
him who late had been so loftily placed; as if the forced
companionship of felons and murderersthe
imprisonment
in a common Bridewell, were of such power as to
destroy the man, and render him infamous in society;
forgetful that while his actions (which they desired to be
considered as most criminal) were yet in memory, that
they but discovered to the impartial and reflecting the
depth of their own weakness and pitiful malevolence,
without the slightest injury to their enemy by the
intended
contamination; and this seemingly was soon felt by the
authors of this conduct themselves, for the foemen of
Leisler soon grew discontented with this first course of
wreaking their angry feelings, and sought excuses for
it, by stating that it was but in return for the manner they
themselves had been served when in Leisler's hands; and
with their disappointment, their appetite grew ravenous
for sating their long felt evil will, and it was not long ere
they thirsted for blood; and this their victims unfortunate
durance proved but the melancholy note of preparation
to that woeful tragedy that is hereafter related, and which
stains the annals of the provincein conformity with
every part of the usage of their prisoner, the myrmidons
of Leisler's enemies, possibly believing they were doing
a pleasure in their masters' eyes, or at least with their
encouragement
,
heaped on him every ignominy and insult
their ingenious minds could inventmore dank and
dismal
than its fellows was his cellthe most loathsome
beings
that prison could produce were lodged with him, and
he was denied such comforts as the vilest felon was
allowed
bad
as were the others, the place where Leisler
was confined was as it were the very receptacle of filth
and vermin from the other densArnyte whose heart
had leaped joyously at the announcement of his
proximity
to his father, looked for a moment in vain within the
dungeon bounds, and then drew back horror stricken with
that which met his sight, and almost overpowered with the
foul and heavy air he breathed, for an instant he was
unable to proceedGreat God! he cried, wringing
his hands and leaning for support to his sinking frame
against the door-wayis this so indeedI had no
thoughtno ideano dream of thistoo certain my eyes
are mockedcan this becan this be
Among the squalid group of wan, haggard, and
emaciated
forms that were huddled in the precincts of the
cavern
,
the quick and eager vision of the anxious stripling,
marked (while as he looked every pulse trembled with
indistinct
and uncertain fears) the figure in particular of one
manhe was seated on the bare hard flooring of the cell,
but seemingly he recked little of outward sufferanceor
Vol. II. 20
his face was buried in his hands as if in grief or reflection
the marks of years were on his brows, and his hair was
dishevelled and matted as by neglect, and then his
garments
were raggedbut apparently not with wear or time,
the rather as torn by some wanton hand in fray, for they
hung in numerous and lacerated strips that scarce
concealed
the naked body of the wearerArnyte gazed, and his
heart throbbed fast, and with tremulous beatings knocked
at his ribs, for there was something in the air, form, and
character of him on whom his sight rested that spoke to his
very soul, and yet he knew not, he doubted much that
one in such piteous plight; that a shape of such
hopeless
wretchedness could be him he soughtthe man
slowly
raised his headit was indeed the unfortunate Leisler
but his face was so pallid and care-wornso different
from the burley visage which he had worn but in the early
evening of the past night, that none scarce but the
searching eye of affection could have recognized those
altered
looksthe step of Arnyte as he rushed in the
dungeon
faltered, and he could but stagger to his parent's feet
Father, dear father, alone burst from his lips as he
flung his arms about the old man's neck
Father, dear father, look upon thy son, continued
the youth after a moment's pause, he is here, as he
should be, at thy sideat the side of him who gave him
birth; he hath come to bear with thee the evil tides of
fortune; he hath come, as he ought, to stand by thee
through weal, through wo; father, dear father, look upon
thy child.
But yet the parent spoke not to his offspring;
deadlier pale had grown his countenance, and his teeth
were fixed and strongly set together; but his eye
alarmed
,
for it was distended with a look unconscious, wild
and glassy; so still, stirring not and motionless, did he
sit, that one might have supposed him frozen at the
instant
,
to a powerless and inanimate form, upon the spot.
Why is this! what have I done, that thus the vials
of wrath should be poured to the very drain, upon my
head? exclaimed the terror-stricken youth, dashing
himself upon the ground beside his parent, in despair,
alas, where will my miseries end; oh, father, dear
father
,
know you me not? I am him whom you were wont
to call your joyyour hopeyour blessing: you have
told me an hundred times, that the sight of me gave you
new life in age; ah, me, it appeareth to have killed thee,
rather. He took his father's cold hand and pressed it
to his lips, his brows, and his bosom;ah, sighed he,
my heart strings are tough, that they crack not, for
much have I endured.
Leisler's breast heaved slowlyhis hands, that had
been clenched as in death, relaxed their stern gripe
his lips laboured, and a trembling ran through his frame,
shaking it like the limbs of an ague stricken infant, and
he burst out at length into a wild and hysterical laugh,
which his surcharged feelings soon changed, as hey
vented themselves in a passionate flood of tears.
Within the dungeon, during this brief action, the
wonted
voice of wo and lamentation, coarse ribaldry, and
hollow hearted merriment, that mocked, like the sound
of music at a funeral feast, the actual suffering of the
place, was stilledand the harsh and iron hearted men
of outlawry and of crime, stood there in silence, and
looked on the scene in strange amazement; and while
the most hardened and unfeeling gazed with no throb
of heart, but with derisive eye, and lip of sneering
mockerymayhap for a moment there was some
solitary wretch, unvisited of hope or comfort, to whom
the sight brought back the long lost tenderness of
memory
,
of shunning friend or parent, from whom unrepented
crime had banished and severed every natural tie, and
brought neglect alone, whether in disease, sickness or
deathfor such are often the bitter and miserable fruits
of unthinking profligacy.
Mien kindmien zonmien eyes are broken with
old age; I zee not regt, quoth Leisler at last, as his
fast, heavy and blinding tear-drops trickled on Arnyte's
bosom, I'd dort I was alleen in de waareldbut 'tis
niet zo'tis niet zomien kinder is mit memien braaf
kinder, dat zeeks hish old vader in hish hartzeer mit der
komfort of hish liefde.
Yes, father, returned the youth, the growth of
thy flesh, the sapling of thy root, is not such as
composed
the herd that trooped around thy holiday fortunes;
he hath joyed in the sunshine that o' late was on thy name;
but darkness, which now sits above our house, hath not
changed thee to him; ah yes, thou art still my parent;
am I not a part of thy very self? am I not a branch of
the very tree that derives its existence from the trunk?
the woodman's knife may lop away from the oak its
limb; the tempest, in its rage, may sweep it from its
hold; but can it then live? ah no, it is withered to death
by the very parting; the way hath been cheerless,
stormy and rugged, but I am here; even with thee, in
thy dreary prison.
Mien zeer kind, dis is wellregt well, said the old
man after an interval, in which he fondly perused the
lineaments of the stripling's countenance, and held his
hand with the strong lock of affection, de groodt God
rebay dien waardvor dien szweed vace makes mien
hertz glad in mien zorrowjaja! Arnyte, dou be'est
de sday op mien lieveen, mien goed kind! inderdaad I
have zufferred zince last I zee de, boybut it is bast
it is over, now I looks into dine eyesh, I am gelukkig
I am bleased mit mien lot. He apparently
endeavoured
to lighten his features with a faint smile, as he
continued
,
dis blace is niet zo bada klien koud and
schrikkelykdat's niet to a menschstill dis is nien
dreatment vor a Nederlandt burgher, mien zon!
To this last mournful and indignant observation,
Arnyte
could give no answer of solace or of soothing, for
the gloomy prospect around, and the mean and spiteful
injustice of Leisler's foes, was too glaring in all its naked
and horrid truth, to admit of palliation, or of future hope;
it was too palpable, that the reins of their passions were
unloosed; that unless some curb or boundary, was soon
placed on their progress of persecution, that it would
be hard to tell what would be the fearful close of their
actions against the object of their venomous feelings,
unprotected
and abandoned to their merciless revenge.
The youth clung to his father's shoulders, droopingly
and in silencewhile the old man seemed roused by the
thought of all he had undergone, and of the insults which
he was yet bearing from his enemies, from the usual
timid and lethargic manner, which had been his principal
characteristic, and which had so long made him the
passive
tool of deeper and more designing politicians.
By myn trouwe! said he at last, while the sore
anguish awakened in his heart from the mischances he
had so recently sustained, alike with the bitterness of his
attempted humiliation, brought words of anger more rapid
to his lips, and with a force beyond his accustomed
hesitating
utterance and lack of thought, he spoke as if the
endurance of adversity had granted power of speech
uncommon to his heavy lip; and such hath been remarked
with wonder in men of slow and laborious character, and
uncultivated minds, that in the depth of their sorrows, or
in moments of need and stress, their tongues, as it were,
have been unloosened, and an eloquence far above them
hath flowed forth, like some lazy rivulet swoln by
mountain
rains, bursting to the amazement of those who on its
borders dwell, the barriers at whose sides it had
heretofore
slept in veriest gentleness.By myn trouwe!
quoth he,by the ashes of my dead mother! exclaimed
the burgher in the language most familiar from his
infancy, and abandoning the broken utterance of his vain
attempts at by him the less used speech of the
conquerors
of the Nieuw Nederlandts;by the ashes of
my dead mother,I swear, were I a rogue for the leash,
worse I had not been used; sooth, the dungeon wherein
Andross cast me when I stood as burgomaster of Albany
against his innovation on the Classes of Amsterdam, was
a stadtholder's palace to this hole;were I a dog,a
drove and beaten dog, I would sicken at this hovel and
rot upon a common dunghill, rather than bear its
loathsomeness
and
then,and thenbut I'll not fret me, for
it pleases them; it is to make these eyes of mine forget
themselves and send forth tear-drops, that thus I am
treated; and then they'll shout at my childishnessbut
I'll not do itno, no! they shall wring blood first from
my heartstringsgreat God! and have they not done it
19*
miserable old man! the sins of all thy life hath been
punished in one hourMilbournemy rash,my bold,
my brave one, where art thou now! Oh villains!
murtherous, bloody hounds, the waters of the
Amstraccan
will not wash thy stained hands clean from the deed
thou hast foully doneand where sleeps the laggard
lightnings; of old, it hath shot down even at the altar's
basewhy not now? But what helpfrom thatfool!
foolwhat can give thee back thy daughter's husband,
thy son!what then dost complain ofwild, doting,
childish man;alas! my heart aches bitterly: if but
this doth come of all my fortunes, better,far better had
I never seen light of life, than thus to be abandoned,
thus left alone, in sorrow and in solitude. And he sat
down on the floor from which he had started, while he
poured out the hot o'erflowings of his burthened bosom,
and beat his breast, and wrung his hands, in all the agony
of grief. With many long and vain attempts, and
anxious
breathings of comfort that his pallid cheek and
watery eye belied, did Arnyte strive to still the perturbed
feelings of his afflicted parent; but fruitless were his
endeavours, until the torrent of his grief had passed
away; and then a stern calm followed which was even
more frightful than the loud railings of the storm that
had disturbed him, and with its violence, shaken every
nerve. As the youth gazed with fearful look upon the
still stern and fixed visage of Leisler, the words of hope
and solace that he had called to his mind died away upon
his trembling lips, even at the utterance.
Fond boyfond boy, muttered Leisler, grasping
with despairing violence the hand of his son, you know
not what you say; you are young, and dream not what
bad men may do; you speak of changeof better times
to come;and he laughed wildly as he spokedeath
will come first; know I not those whom I deal with?
they have tasted bloodMilbourne's blood. Think ye
they will be content?no, boy, no! thou knowest not
what they will do; their thirst of hate will not be
quenched, (I deem it so from their nature;) while life
courses in these veins,while my voice hath strength to
make a rallying word against them; yes, this prison-house
betokens the commencement of their mercies;where
think you it will end?why, in the grave, when the sod
of the burial ground is laid upon this head,when the
wine cup passes round at my funeral, and I am but as a
clod, unenvied by the lowest wretch in life.
Death! my sire,nay thou speakest not of death?
inquired Arnyte, while a fearful shudder shook his frame;
you do not deem they have the powerthe fell
purpose
to dare so vile an act! life rests not with them.
Great God! you cannot think they will attempt a
measure
unheard of, where there hath been no crime. The
law of the land is not a reed, to bend the way they
choose to turn it; if it is, out on it for a mockeryay,
every thing malice can devise may be dreaded, but they
surely have not the wickedness of that which would bring
on their heads the scathing bolt of heaven's wrath.
No matterboyno matterworry not thyself upon
the thought, returned with affected calmness the devoted
burgher, it is not worth thy tearI reck not for the
worst they may docheer thee Arnyte, for an the last ill
come, they shall not see us grievemy enemies shall not
triumph in a groan of mineno! I'll not flinch from their
torturesnot an atom; an as though a seated and
embedded
rock, this frame shall stir not for wind or wave.
Slow and heavily did the wearisome hours of sorrow
move o'er the inmates of the prison, while sad and
comfortless
(for sunken even in spite of the utmost
endeavours
at resolution were the hearts of both the father
and his son,) was their dreary conversethey sat with
hands clasped in each other's in fond affection, unriven by
misfortune, and aye glancing on each other's care-worn
countenance with looks that spoke far more than words;
now and then a tear-drop blinded the sight of the boy as
he gazed on the furrowed face of his parent; but the orbs
of the old man were hot, burning, and dry as a fountain
channel in the desert when the Simoon had passeda
stern and melancholy darkness of mind was on them
unbroken
by a glimmer of light.
And now the solitary and desolate prisoner, who shun
ning the herd of his mates to look on the heaven and waters,
for whose liberty his heart yearned, and breathe the rushing
of another atmosphere through the casement pane, and
rusted
gratings of his dungeon window, marked as he counted
the close of another day of durance, (which noted on his
calendar, in length as it were a year,) the light of the sky
gorw dull without, and the deep, and dusky glow of the
setting sunbeam tinging with a long streak of crimson hue,
the deep and transparent waves of the Oost vloed that
flowed in front of the stadt-huis slip, and shedding a misty
glory over the solemn woods that lined the opposite shores
of New Yorkshire
[23]
[23]
One of the ancient names of Long Island.
whose bold beach looked like ruins,
with stern crags and hoary rocks that rose from out the
brown and reddish tufts of autumnal fern in vast masses,
upon whose bare, bleak summits sudden and awful
shadows
dwelt like dark clouds from out the waters, through
which now and then like snow flakes the sea-fowl showered
their white wings, scouring and wheeling in mid air, anon
dipping in the moving wavesslowly the mist grew
closer
,
and clouds of night, black and swelling, hung on the
utmost verge of the darkening horizon, in the breaks of
which the eye could trace here and there the outlines
and shapes of river craft drawing themselves away in the
distance, seeming with their white sails like birds flitting
before the coming night; while the living sea swept by
the breezy air ran rapidly along like a wild and
bounding
steedawhile and it grew darker, and the clumsy
dutch vessels at the slip's heads, which but a moment
before
were distinguishable with their huge black masts,
their bows and stems rising high above the centre of the
deck, and their small cabin windows sunken and inserted
in their structure like the eyes of a sheep's head, mingled
in one formless, shapeless mass, beyond which only here
and there afar out the eye could catch glimpses of the
river through the gathered night; and then started to life
the cabin lights which dotted the wave far around, like
sparkling stars; the bondsman's mind painted them as
happy glow-worms disporting at largeand as the
boatmen's
voice of revelry, which continued long after the city
bell had tolled the hour of rest, rose to his ears from the
anchored batteaux, he sickened at the joy of others, and
with a heavy heart turned in the charnel gloom of his
darksome dungeonthere no longer he could distinguish
the savage and desperate visages of his associates, for
the darkness of the sepulchre was there; but ever and
anon as he crouched him down upon his hard straw,
breaking the sleep he sought to woo, there brokeon
his ear the horrid imprecationferocious oathand
the hollow rattle of chains and gyvesrecalling to the
mind, which would have winged itself away to rest in
deep unconsciousness, the body's bondage, and the
dreadful
place that enclosed himand then too, though many
a callous ruffian dozed quietly as an infant dreaming in
its purity on its mother's bosom, there were some, now
that thought was no longer guiled with the sports or
pursuits
to which to drown reflection day had been devoted
who shivered as the aspen as their evil deeds thronged
on their busy brain, and shuddering superstition played
its dire pranks, and their blood grew ice even at the
horror of their own minds;for indeed there are some
men so fashioned and textured by nature's hand, so timid
from birth and raising, that it wants not truth in
punishments
of after life that monkish legends teach, to visit
on them justice for their crimesand there are those
who in the broad day wantonly and boldly defy every
right of lawwhether of the divinity or of mankindyet at
the still and solemn hour of midnight, have felt the beaded
drop of fear course on their sullen cheeks, and undergone
all the anguish of awakened remorsethe pricking of an
angered conscience;and now all was silence in that
prison save the deep and heavy breathing of the sleepers,
and ever and anon the half stifled moan of such whose
sufferings and sorrows dwelt even with him in the visions
of the night and gave him no rest; or the groan of the
burthened heart of one on whose eyes no sleep could
come;the sight of Leisler and Arnyte, the father
and his child were closed, and they lay folded in each
other's arms upon the cold damp floorno cover guarded
them from the searching night airno hand of tenderness
smoothed their pillow, but the grey hairs of age and the
black locks of youth mingled on the iron stanchions that
bound the dungeon floorthere they lay, the boy's arms
clung fondly (like the ivy wreath around the oak's trunk)
about the parent's neck, whose one arm pillowed the
youth's head, while his other drew him closer to his
breast, and the father's lip rested on the clear and snowy
forehead of his son; so bound together in that silent
embrace, they seemed, those two, the one bound as it
were, to the heart of the otherlike bright and
blooming
spring, upon the bosom of hoary winter; and they
sleptyet amid the soft breathings of the stripling, ever
and anon, there came a sigh, low but painful, showing
that sorrow was at the heart, and mingled with the
sweetness of his sleep; and on the long eyelash there
hung a little tear drop, that, ere the eye had closed, had
moistened it, like a bead of dew lingering at nightfall on
the leaves of the violet; but the old man's rest was
sound, deep and heavy; he appeared unconscious of
all that had befallen him, for the time, as though he had
been stretched upon a couch of downy softness, instead
of that rough floor. Even so, might it be said, that
innocence
sleeps, alone rewarding the good when pressed
by misfortunes, and overwhelmed by the raging tempest of
the world, had there not been at hand, a stern
contradiction
of the fair theory, a reality that laid in ashes as by the
devouring flames, the sweet fabric built by the busy hand
of virtue, to support its cause; for could the sight have
parted in light the darkness of that dungeon gloom, it
would have marked the placid countenances and
unbroken
sleep of many, stained with the blackest crimes man
is capable of perpetrating; and there was one, who
couched almost at the side of that pure hearted pair
a man of wicked deedsa ruthless ruffian, with hands
incarnadineand yet his visage was clear and open as
day itself; honesty, frankness, and nobleness of nature,
seemed settled on his brow, and his dreams, his sleep,
judging from his looks, were as sweet as that of youth
when pillowed on the breast of love. And is it not
truly so? A few, indeed, may suffer amid the great
crowd of mankind, the sore agonies of remorse, as though
a viper sucked the heart; but how many more appear
to grow hourly more and more callous, if they be not
born dead to every compunction of conscience, and
flinch from no pang, except such as is drawn forth from
the severing of their outward flesh, or the loss of the
blood that feeds their sluggish veinsand yet they prate;
the churchman preaches, for it is his duty; and the dull
moralist teaches, (though both know the hollowness of
their doctrines, which should be sound and true, but are
not,) the honours that attend an honest life, and the
glories
of an unspotted mind; albeit, it is but a sophism;
how many honest men, the practisers of the theory,
sink in the grave, beneath the persecutions of their
fellow
,
after a most miserable life, the close of which, was
its happiest hour? hath the world, yea, the civilized
world, been known to give a man bread for his honesty?
hath it respected him the moreshow when? Hath
he for a trait of virtue, been exalted above his fellow?
The examples, if any, are solitary ones, to which a
thousand
of the opposite cast could be set off; nathless, virtue
seemeth but a holiday theme for dying dotards, school
boys, and for the carving of an inscription for a tombstone;
and where is the proof that it is no lie? go to the burial
ground; doth not the relics of the villain, lay as
peaceful
as the best? doth the sod that covers him, tremble
and heave under the treading foot? doth not the young
flowret climb from his turf, as lovely as from that of
another? doth not his children enjoy in happiness, the
fruits of his multitudinous wrongs to his fellow? and yet
it is of the grave and its inhabitant, whether all ends
there, or there is aught beyond it, on which every
human
maxim against vice and wickedness, is founded;
then if death be but the herald to a state of altered
being
,
the threshold of another lifethe gate of entrance
to a new existencewhy should nature shrink with
terror
and affright, from its approach? why, as from the
bound of a tiger, should we start from the thought of
separation of animate being from the inert clay? and
yet, who living, can assert the truth? what actual proof
hath the astronomer, that it is not an ideal fantasy, when
he proclaimed that every silvery spangle of the vast
heaven, was a world, even like that in which we breathe?
and who can look upon the corpse of him who was once
quick like ourselvesin whose eye light shoneon
whose cheek health wantonedand in whose now
palsied
and stiffened limbs, were strength and action, and
can show there is aught preserved, more than remains
of the corrupt and passive matter, already a dwelling
for the worms, loathsome to the sight, even of those who
loved it but late, and for which, darkness, the tomb, and
the damp earth, are alone fit receptacles. Alas! so
impenetrable
to us is the mist which parteth life and death,
so little can we judge from the passages of life the true
incentives of human events, of that which vice may dread
and virtue hope, that the mind, wearied with the
unsatisfied
thought, at times may fly, perhaps not erroneously,
to the wild idea that we are all creatures of some mighty
puppet show, foredoomed our parts to act, and when that's
o'er, e'en like the worthless images of wood, we drop
down a cold, blank piece of nothingnessno more! * * *
Suddenly, afar off within the building, there arose a
hollow
,
rumbling sound, which gathered force in its approach,
and rolling towards the outer door of the hall, broke with
its noise upon the dreary stillness of the interior prison;
and then it grew strong and more distinct, and now the
loud clattering of footsteps was plainly heard, and at
once three heavy and abrupt blows upon the iron that
secured the lock of the exterior entrance of the hall,
echoed sharply through the dungeons, startling from their
sleep the drowsy inhabitants of each cell, who scarce
awakened, gazed about them in the dreariness of the place
with vacant and alarmed looks; and then a strong, coarse
voice, which came from near the door, (as with words
of friendly caution to such as might have been engaged in
desperate strife to burst away the bonds that bound their
cramped limbs, or had been labouring with increasing
toil beneath the friendly shadow of the night, to break the
securities of the prison, and give themselves that liberty the
offended laws denied, or such as might from other causes,
adverse to their safe keeping, dread the jailer's visit,)
pierced with the echo of its cry the farthest nook of
the prison-housethe rounds, the rounds,it called;
douse ahead, douse ahead,keep dark, or there'll be
a team upon you. The warning, like watchfire lit from
cape to headland to tell the approach of an enemy, ran
from lip to lip, and in an instant the ready filethe knife
the saw, and every implement of assistance which,
defying
the keeper's argus eye, had been by their associates
who were without, conveyed to the prisoners, were
concealed
beyond search or discoveryand though anxious
and awake, upon their pallets did the cunning convict lay,
there was nought to be seen that could arouse suspicion.
In a few moments the doors were opened, and their
vacancy
admitted Mienheer Stoutenbergh and his assistants,
who, in addition to their usual attire, wore pistolets which
bristled in the leather girdles about their waists; these
were accompanied by four of the adelborsten, having
their side-arms alone, and hearing huge torches, with
which the steps of the whole party were lighted, and
which, as they went along, cast a flickering and momentary
glare upon the rude and rugged prison walls, and flashed
with red and dusky hue upon the dark iron gratings
around, whose openings were thronged with the frowning
and ferocious visages of the criminals who herded in the
inner cells, and who, alternately in light and mist, seemed
like chattering and mowing fiends, that in the shadows of
the sepulchre are seen by burial lamps; or, like the souls
of the damned caged for the burning: at each cell the
rounds stopped with harsh and brief words of greeting,
with curses or opprobrious epithets, not as discoursing
to a human being, a member of civilized society, a
man, but rather, as it were, some beast or obnoxious
slave that was addressed, the party spoke to some of its
inhabitants, while at the same time with hasty yet careful
labour they struck the walls and irons, and ran over with
quick glances every corner and nook of the gloomy den,
even to shooting once or twice, to learn their safety, the
bolts of the dungeon doors. Thus from cell to cell the
party moved along, while as he listened to their coming,
Vol. II. 21
the heart of Arnyte beat quickly with foreboding of evil,
and trembling with terrors for miseries yet unknown, he
almost ceased to breathe, as though the air from which
he drank in life was pregnant with misfortune; at length
the door of his father's dungeon was flung back, and
Mynheer
Stoutenbergh and his followers stood at the side of
Leisler, who in the din and clatter that was around, lay
silent, still, and motionless, so deep was the sleep that
was upon his brows.
What ho! I say! Master Leislerfico! old un, rouse
thee, thou art as fast as a new padlock, hoarsely cried,
or rather bawled the jailer, in the ear of the dreaming
burgher, at the same time roughly and unceremoniously
shaking the old man by the shoulders. At the caitiff's
violence
the blood of Arnyte boiled in his veins; he could
scarce restrain his rising choler at the sight of the
unfeeling
ruffianprudence alone kept him in silence. What,
I say, the old dog dozes here as well as ever he did 'mid
his grandeur up yonder in the fort; fico! I say, Dolph,
between us, if I can see thro' a millstone, he'll sleep a
deal sight sounder ere long, if hemp seed can make him
easy: what think you, ha?there'll be business for
Tony
De, and the wretch grinned horribly as he spoke,
on his associate, but come, old un, get thee up; the
court waits to try thee man, an withouten thee there'll be
little or no sport.
Leisler, awakened by the rude salutation, abruptly
raised himself upon his arm, and at first, with a wild,
vacant
,
and startled gaze, looked about and on the faces that
were peering over him, as unconscious for the moment of
the place where he was, and of the persons by whom he
was addressed and surrounded.
What seek you of the desolate? said he, after a
moment's pause, Sooth! I had thought I had gone
down to the grave, and was beyond the reach of sounds
from human voice, or torture of man's presence.
Fico, man! you must have your trial before you die,
so don't be in a hurry, quoth Mienheer Stoutenbergh in
reply, and the Court hath sent us for you, for they are
waiting here in the stadthuis, though if it please you, old
un, belike they'll make a short job of it, so get thee up, man
and come along, for time wastes while we talk on the matter.
By my troth! said Leisler, starting in astonishment,
this is most strange! they have chosen a murky hour,
thus at night, when half the city lays in sleep, to drag me
to the presence of their judgment seat, with no friend or
counsel near me; this lithe boy alone at my side to
support
my feeble step. Thou must mistake; it cannot be;
there are laws to govern uswhat! with no warning for
preparation! no evidence to testify for me, or time to bring
them! What hope have I in meeting accusations as yet
unknown to me? What safety have I in innocence, thus
driven, thus persecuted? but it is not hard to see their
design; although inebriated and drunken with the
conquest
they have attained, they dare not face their victim
when the world looks on: in the face of day they refuse
me hearing; but thus, at this dread hour, black as their
secret purposes, am I summoned, andbut no matter;
lead on thy way, Mienheer, I am ready to attend thee.
As Leisler spoke, he uprose himself from the ground,
but his motion was slow and painful, for his limbs were
cramped and stiffened with the chill air of the night, that,
with the damp, unwholesome vapours of the dungeon,
and the iron hardness of the couch on which he had
reposed
,
had stricken to his bloodand as he stood up,
there came for a moment, and of a sudden, a dizziness
upon his brain and mist of darkness on his sight, that in
his weakness he had like to have fallen, for the objects
about him seemed to swim along in his eye, like the shore
in appearance to the passing mariner, and all things for
the time looked dim and indistinct.
Mienheer, you totter and look faint, said one of the
soldiers, approaching the old man kindly, you had
better
lean upon my arm; I can take guard of the torch, and
also support your faltering steps, for we have not far to
go to where the Court sits.
Nay, friend, I thank thee; but I have a son left,
returned the burgher, recovering himself, I had not
thought there was so little strength in meI have grown
old in the last few hours; but it is not to be wondered at,
misfortune
saps us to the very core, and like a palsy withers
up the vital springs of beingand in truth I am not much
used to the fare I have just lived ontears, tears,
heartaches, and a dungeon lodging were wont to be
strangers
to the name of Leisler: mine ancestors were
burghers
of Rotterdam an hundred years, and there stands no
record against them, and yet Ibut I'll not sorrow on it;
no crime; they cannot bring a shadow of guilt against me
most faithful have I served their majesties of England,
and these chainsmayhap a scaffold, are my reward! well,
well, your hand, my boy; my aged frame, borne down
with sorrow, more from the stings of ingrates than mine
own sufferings, lacks prop.
Come, master, it is fit you hasten, said the jailer, in
a surly and impatient tone.
I pray you pardon my forgetfulness, replied
Leisler
,
Mienheer, I will go on with you.
The jailer now led the way and preceded Leisler,
whose waning steps were upheld by the supporting arm
of Arnyte, whose presence, either by design on the part
of the jailer, or inattention from the more important
circumstances
in the business of the moment, excited neither
surprise nor inquiry; the adelborsten with careful guard,
followed close upon their progress, and two of them bared
their swords and placed themselves nearer the prisoner
as they wended from the prison wards into the body of
the stadthuis; and as they walked along the passages of
the place, the pace of Leisler quickened and grew firmer,
for seemingly a new life sprung in his veins for the time
as he heard and beheld the dark gate of that dismal place
of penance, wherein he had pined, with its strong locks
and massy bars closed behind him, and he was revived by
the free air beating on his brow through casements where
no dungeon impediments broke its wild and wanton course,
and his hopes, and pride, and spirit, rose within him,
contending
against the sad realities that encompassed him like
some wild fire entopping an opposing wall; albeit, he felt
like the lion loosed and uncaged, and called to the
gladiator's
combat in the arena, scarce wotting, however nobly
he bore himself, he was the doomed sacrifice; a victim
marked for slaughter, unheard, untried.

THE TRIAL.
The
persons who composed the commission of Oyer
and Terminer which had been assembled to try Jacob
Leisler, and to decide his fate on the accusations already
charged against him by his active and inveterate enemies
by direction of Governor Sloughter and his new sworn
council, were convened together in a small dark room of
the Stadthuis, in the gloomy, mean, and ill-lighted
precincts
of which there was but little that savoured of the
high and solemn sitting of a court, that periled in that
which it was about deliberating on, the life and honour
of a fellow creature. The judges were seated around a
table, in the centre of which was placed a dim and
solitary
lanthorn, through the close, thick, and dingy glass of
which poured out the weak and prison rays that scarce
pierced the dismal shadows of the apartment, rendering
with their feeble gladness of light the cheerlessness of the
place more striking; but where its nearer beams were
thrown with more vividness of power on the countenances
of those who were present, and who in deep and anxious
converse huddled within its influence, it discovered in the
speaking visages of the greater part, neither the cool and
composed calmness of men firm in determination, nor the
collectedness of aspect and demeanour to be expected
from such, of whom was demanded fair and unmoved
judgment, both as to the accuser and the accused.
Various
were the tell tale and convulsed movements of the
21*
disturbed features of the majority of these men,
bespeaking
the hurry of alarm, fever of excited passion and hate
timid anxiety and selfish care for their own preservation
in the course they were called to pursue, that with busy
thoughts shook their distracted minds; for although
selected
with caution requisite to the furtherance of their
purposes by those inimical to the deposed ruler of the
province, as persons in whom reliance could be placed in
their absolute devotion to the views of the Bayard
faction
,
yet so abrupt had been the change of public
matters
,
that like a vision it could scarce be realized; but
yesterday, the name of him whose fate was in their hands,
to be disposed of now as suited the enmity of his foemen,
was all powerful in the landand yet within so brief a
space of time as had passed, it had become a stigma and
a reproach to be known his partizan: and then, too,
without
previous warning or preparation they had been called
togetherthey had been suddenly and with haste
summoned
,
their perturbed feelings having scarce time to
tranquillize, from the late hurried violence and public
irritation
,
to fulfil the fearful duty, and painful part of which
there was not one, the most ignorant among them, who
dared encourage himself was not already marked out for
their performance; and that however clear of guiltiness,
or even innocent of the shadow of committal of the
crimes coined for his destruction and laid to his charge,
that if the victim of the unhallowed persecution of
unceasing
and untiring revenge, was dismissed by their
assent
from the power of his enemies, and by their means
was disentangled from his thraldom, untorn and
unmangled
by the eager hands of his angered adversaries, their
actions could not have been such as were evidently
expected from them, nor would be pleasant in the sight
of those, who, from whom, if they did not immediately
derive their stations and their consequence, were, in the
least, the master spirits of the day, in whose presence all
favour was gained and in whose smiles were rank
and influence; and then too there were those elder
and wary, to whom experience had taught the instability
of popular opinion, the madness of decision founded on
the sandy support of the prejudices that rule, however
potent, yet but for the hour, the wavering passions of the
crowd, unfaithful and changeable as the wind that sweeps
with wanton career the crest of the sounding surgewhom
years of endurance of the bitterness of disappointed
calculation
,
of wrecked hopes, and shattered power, while
like some fragile plank upon the stormy billow they swam
the current of uncertain fortune, gathering wisdom from
their own sufferance, had learnt how little faith could be
placed, however favourable for the time the appearance
of affairs, upon the steadiness of success, or the
permanency
of the elevation of any rival faction of the day; nor
could doubts in the minds of such be banished that the
party triumphant now might ere long yield its sway as
quickly as it had conquered, to the one whose fugitive
remnants were every where seeking safety in
concealment
,
fallen and defeated. There was, therefore, in the
manner of the many, who could the less easy from want
of nerve conceal and cloak into the inmost recesses of
their hearts, the secret disturbance of their thoughts,
which was obvious to their companions, an unguarded
vacillation, a fickle, nervous and hesitating temper, both
in word and action; nevertheless, the cunning hand of
the deepest and darkest policy had framed the Court to
perfect the better its own hidden ends; well had been
foreseen and cared for in its composition the various
nature
of its members: they were of mingled elements,
mixed of good and ill, artfully giving the shadow of justice
to the proceedings, which had, in truth, been catered out
to their peculiar tools, by Bayard and his associatesin
relief to the weak and undetermined, were stern and
resolute
men, the very sycophants of their superiors, who
thought not, cared not for the future while revelling in the
present sunshine, who, without will of their own, were
ready to obey that command which was given them, and
pursue to the very uttermost the road pointed out to
them by those on whose skirts their fortunes hung; and
although there were among the judges of that court one
or two who were really honest, yet these were of that
weak disposition as to be overawed and borne down by
the active loudness of argument of their companions,
although
in giving way to their influence, they flattered
themselves they were convinced of the rectitude of the
course they were taking; these were of that class of men,
honest, it is true, in intention, but who hush their
consciences
,
and who, to their own love of ease and comfort,
yield up to the more ardent in disputation the rights or
lives of their fellows; nor, however despicable, is this
species of being rare, the germ exists in this dayit is
from men of this kind that the fallacy is proved of that which
hath been so highly vaunted as the most perfect of human
institutions, the boasted bulwark of civil and social liberty
the trial by jury; in which, withal its admirers have shown
is alone exhibited how fleeting a reliance, how false the
faith, and how uncertain the right which depend on the
strength of virtue and the changeable and variable
resolutions
of mankind; for what can be more faithless than
that which is ever open to the assaults of interest and of
prejudice, and which being made up by numbers hath the
less power to resist united the attacks of open corruption,
or withstand being tampered with by insidious guiles and
temptation. And however dangerous these, they are
neither the only nor the worst influence which is to be
dreaded in the minds of men taken as judges
indiscriminately
from the common crowd; there is among others,
(and it is a fearful principle, a blot dark and deep, a vile
deformity of nature, that with its general prevalence, like
a leprosy, spreads to the heart, making it rotten to the
very core,) that involuntary though natural bias of the
mind, which is momently received by imperceptible seeds
in its inmost recesses, from whence conviction itself
cannot
uproot its avidious hold. Prejudice is like that fatal
disease, that in our northern clime wastes away our life
like a waning lamp, and maketh fat the grave; its grasp
is death, though the infatuated victim derides its power,
and when nearest the most fearful hour of its strength,
buoys itself up with hope of life, and dreams of health
while palsied with sickness; so prejudice is drank in
greedily
,
as it were in our very intercourse with the world
and often when most we condemn it, we are more driven,
by its fatal currentfor it is the habitual idea which
without
the exercise of judgment, for this at such times is
torpid until too late to be used, or be in the least
efficacious
,
that ingrafts itself from common rumour, (and
belief
is ever ready to swallow aught monstrous, strange, or
ill of our fellows) and from the information of others upon
the pliant thought, it is the sense of the multitude which
the wisest uses as his own, mistaking it for the sober
effects
of his own reason, when it is the air blown bubble
that he hears from a thousand lipswhen it is the
overpowering
impulse of his mind, heated by popular sway and
opinion, preventing a cool and correct direction of the
understanding; slight though its foundation, a breath, a
feather its cause, still will its purpose be the same, and
its reign hold pace with life itself, mixing with its minutest
circumstance, directing its duties and its actions; and
though on its face a gross absurdity, equally vile, terrible,
and detestable to other prevailing opinions, contrary to
right itself, yet guided by it, blinded to the truth, man
rushes headlong on, doing deeds unhallowed, crimes that
were it not for the applauding voice of the inconsistent
world would make him shudder at himself. To-day it
assumes in its terrific career the garb of religious zeal;
then to-morrow it is pretended principle, and again
committing
every violence under the name boldly owned of
party, finding admirers, defenders, and followers for every
step it takes, making the laws themselves subservient to
sinister views, however adverse to common sense, to
virtue
,
and morality; and yet so fickle are the feelings that
arise from the promptings of prejudice, that that which
at one time is iniquity, at another is honesty itself, and the
same voice that elevates deception, cries it down from the
station to which it had lifted it; for it is the weakness of
nature to long after continual novelty, and deceit and
falsehood
being the most admired by imagination, most times
rule our fancy, which ever thirsting for variety is the
more prone to credulity, and for the moment is inflamed
in proportion to the force and operation of the first cause
which it receives; but the animosity of the passion thus
addressed being satiated, it is the more avaricious of fresh
gratification, and is ready to be controlled by any
dominion
so it be new, and false to that which governed last.
What safety, then, exists to life or property, when at the
mercy of men liable to be sported with by this
predominant
powerequally to be played on like the sands by
the sea breezewho are more times piloted in their
passage
of existence by passion than truth? in sooth it is a
mockery, a solemn masquerade that maketh a derision of
justicethat places in the hands of a dozen men, possibly
all ignorant or obstinate, the dearest privileges, the most
sacred rights, and the most hallowed principles of social
connexion. How feeble the chance of right, (though
sometimes blundered on) even if pure and honest, is to
be derived from the minds of a motley and indiscriminately
chosen juryset to decide the most intricate subject
affairs of national and mercantile importance depending
on the uninformed fiat of unlettered and unwashed
artizans
and tradesmen, to whom the customs, and the law
which is to direct them, are as inexplicable as the
labyrinth
of Crete; and then, too, the dangers that beset
them in their own selfishnessthe dread of privation in
some, the uninterested feeling of others, whose whole
thoughts are centered in their own absent affairs, and
are ready to sacrifice any thingconscience, their own
sense of rectitude, to escape from the subject to which
their attention is demanded; then the weak dependence
on the will of others, the composition of their opinion
to the majority; and last, the obstinate ignorance,
unconvinced
by fact or reason, of some dogmatical logician,
whose only cause for adherence to the course he takes,
is the pride of bringing others, by dint of stubbornness,
to side with him in ideas which though preposterous,
having first started, he conceives it incumbent on him
to maintain:all these render perilous the course of
justice
,
and are as quicksands, through which it is indeed
fortunate if it escape wreck or injury in its passage;
while to the dullest vision, the hollowness of the whole
solemn parade of law is apparentand to its enactors
may justly be applied, what the ancient sage said of the
priests of Rome, `that he was surprised, that they who
were so well acquainted with the farce and holy
juggles
of their religion, could see one another without
laughing.'
But albeit, to return to the matter that hath been
digressed
from; the tenor of action planned for the court,
before
which Leisler was now about to appear, the rather
for form than for the least opportunity of vindication of
conduct, was such as well became the dark intentions of
his enemies and the more befitted the tyrannic tribunal
of an arbitrary and military despota Roman prtor of
a conquered province, than one convened in pursuance
of the strict and equitable law of the province; and
bound in its bearing and decision, by long established
and matured authorities, which had been exercised in
similar cases, without regard to private feelings, either for
or against the delinquent. It is true, that owing to the
disordered
and convulsed situation of public affairs during
the latter part of the rule of Leisler himself, that cases
of emergency, that had a bearing on the welfare of the
state as it then stood, such as treasonable attempts to
overthrow the then established authority, by a law, or
rather a necessary edict, passed for its own safety by the
partizan council of the day, were taken under a hasty
and immediate cognizance, and the power of deciding for
life or death was assumed against the criminal, as in the
case of Bayard and Nichols, detailed in one of the
former
sections of this narration; the height of party
spirit
,
and unceasing exertion of their opponents, rendering
an undue severity on the part of the Leslerian faction
towards their invidious foes, oftentimes, if not wholly
excusable, at least, greatly to be extenuated. Yet now,
the case was materially changed in its aspectowing
to the Bayard party being countenanced by the new
govenor
,
and thereby apparently upheld by the shadow of
the sovereign in its course, together with the fatal and
stunning
blow, stricken so suddenly to the very roots of the late
opposing faction, for the present, at least, there could
not be the same causes, for fear that had visited the power
of Leisler, or the smallest murmur of discontent towards
themso much in awe did all stand, on that which
seemed to bear the royal sanction, even though through
a satellite; and besides, that a greater odium might fall
upon the government which they had so strenuously
stood out against, and that it might appear unfavourable
abroad, and their procedures the more warranted, they
already had eagerly set out to investigate, and cry down
as violent, rebellious, and illegal, its every act, declaring
not only the laws passed during the period of their
power
,
as contrary to polity, adverse to the statutes of the
mother country, but null and void as the acts and deeds
of rebellious traitorswho, for pursuing a path under
them, were deserving of the scaffold; and with an
eagerness
only to be accounted for by the rabid and
ravenous
hunger, to destroy all that could remind them that
they had ever been held under the sway of a man so
detested
by them as Leisler, or fearful that something
might be drawn from them, lessening the charges that
they were making to the world against him, and bring on
themselves an accusation of over hastiness, and perhaps
malice, no sooner could they obtain possession of the
public records of the province, (and in the performance
of their wishes, they were, as may be supposed,
assiduously
assisted by the zeal of Dirk Van Rikketie, to whom
great advantage therefor was given, by his
incorruptibility
and the station he held,) than with a bold hand
they obliterated from the colonial archives nearly every
thing that related to the transaction of the time, which
did not accord with their own story of the Revolution
which had brought forward the name and influence of
Leisler; and indeed, the minutes of the provincial history
(such was the determined hatred of their destruction of
all documents relating thereto) may in vain be searched
as to aught that truly relates to the timea vacuum, a
silence, dark as the hearts of his foes alone remains,
which even the after fortune of his partizans, the
justice
done his family when he lay rotten in the grave by
the undeceived sovereign, has not been able to fill; indeed
the memory that hath followed the fate of this unfortunate
man hath been an unjust one, and is an example of to
what extent power and prejudice can be carried, in its
influence
deforming the fair page of the historian, even for
ages after the truth hath transpired, for though a weak,
and mayhap a misguided man, Jacobus Leisler was
neither
the bad nor the vile one he hath been painted; in
truth he was one against whom the voice of the world
hath been louder than his career deserved, and the might
of his enemies hath been such as to overshadow all the
good branches, leaving the bared plant of evil to flourish
to after times, making true the sublime sentiment of the
Indian orator, `that it is a truth, and a melancholy truth,
that the good things which men do are often buried in the
ground, while their evil deeds are stripped naked and
exposed
to the world;' and yet we are told of the veracity
of this or that chronicler, whose solitary judgment is to
be relied on in the tradition he pens, as bearing the index
of the hearts of those departed to the tomb, and whose
vain conceit lays down the secret sources, the hidden
intention
,
and the undivulged feelings that prompted the
deed whose effect they alone are able to relate; making
this man, as their fancy chooses, a Nero, and that a
Camillus
;
sooth, it is all a fiction, hollow and worthless
can others judge our hearts? where is the man living,
or that can ever exist, who can read that which may
outwardly
appear plain? Dare he presume to tell from what
thought, what fancy, or instinctive spring it hath arisen?
If so, he must be endued with more than men from whom
I have drawn my knowledge of the species; yea, far
more than half the bold historian hath chosen to write, is
but a tissue of invented falsehood, baseless and
unfounded
;
and could the grave be opened, and the harmless
dust that fills them speak as at confessional, there would
be a strange change upon the pages whose substance
hath been so greedily swallowed; the good man would
many times be the bad, and the vile might attain respect,
such as now we dream not on; for so singular is the
course of life, that often that which is excellence, when
it should command admiration, is clouded, like the moon
in a stormy night, in the world's eye, by envious calumny,
unfortunate mischance, suffering, or vile persecution;
but as to the proceedings which were taken against
Leisler
,
nathless, the somewhat like during his power, the
Vol. II. 22
friends of Bayard, supported their conduct by citing in
defence of the mockery, the laws of England during the
preceding reigns, and the arbitrary course of the Star
Chamber; not regarding, (for revenge and hate will
always find arguments to support the most infamous
precedents
and
for the most horrible and monstrous crimes
there is no dearth of the last,) that among the very
complaints
against the house of Stuart, and among the very
main springs of the revolution, which they pretended so
much to glory in, as from it the present government of
England had arisen, had been the very acts which they
called forth in their justification; for they had by their
cruelty and injustice aroused an oppressed nation to snap
asunder their chains of thraldom. And as to the
success
of the Bayard party in their black design of a heavy
sentence on their prisoner, there was apparently no
obstacle
,
although in the principal judge of the Oyer and
Terminer
,
(Sir Thomas Robinson, a man though of dull
intellect
and but little native brightness of character, yet of
intentional uprightness,) they found one whose feelings
did not assimilate to the savage thirst of persecution they
desired; and indeed he was the means of impeding
slightly the course proceeded against the victim, as will
shortly be seen, by his doubts on the evidence of the
crimes for which Leisler was arraigned; he was a short,
harsh, cold and austere featured man, with dark eyes and
thick brows, deep, black, and frowning countenance, the
forbidding aspect of which was heightened by a contraction
of the muscles at the corner of the mouth, which
appeared
always knit and wrinkled, and bespoke a selfish
though determinate character. About him thronged the
gloomy visages of the others, who were joined with him
in his office, their features pallid and gloomy in the
shadows
of the lantern; and as the busy hum of their
whispering
voices arose as they eagerly strove to attain of
each other their secret sentiments and bent of mind
toward the prisoner, whose presence was momently
expected, the thought easily pictured them as
conspirators
assembled in some lonesome cavern, planning
their murderous path of crime. As the rushing of
a hurried and mingled tread without broke on the
murmured converse of the court, and a loud and
hollow
knock upon the door betokened the expected
coming of the prisoner, a deep and intense stillness
pervaded
the apartment; by the sound every tongue was
chained to instant silence;something like a fearful
expectancy seemed imprinted on the anxious countenances
of the persons present, and for a moment, each appeared
to hold his breath at the vibration; for the while, at the
noise the eager communication that had been passing was
stilled, as though the speaker's words had been chilled
upon the warm lip of utterance. Some there were who
turned pale and felt ill at ease, to look upon their victim's
face, as a momentary remorse smote at the dark
resolution
of their hearts; others startled as until then they had
not been aware of the stern certainty of that which they
were doomed to take a part in; but there were those,
who with fierce and steady glance, turned their cold and
unfeeling eyes towards the unclosing door of the
apartment
,
and set their unmoved and forbidden visages in
that fixed cast that tempered and bespoke the character
of their intentions. Clad in his soiled and prison array,
his spirits that had arisen in the semblance of relief from
sufferance and thraldom, afforded in the passage from the
dungeon to the courtsunken and exhausted almost in
the convincement of a moment, like the sudden flash of a
lamp stricken in a charnel-house, and which dies as soon
as lighted, smothered by dank and poisonous vapours from
the rottenness of the surrounding dead,Jacob Leisler
advanced before the tribunal of his judges; as he walked,
his pace was apparently slow and waning, the rather from
faintness than age, if the wan lustre of his sunken eye,
and his pallid and fallen cheek were read aright;and as
though scarce able to support his own frame, he leaned
its trembling weight upon his son; and as he clung,
drooping and careworn, to the stripling's patient arm, he
resembled some tottering ruin of an ancient column,
upheld
alone from falling by the protecting tendril, whose
roots found succour at its mouldering basethe parent
and the childthe goodly oak bent by the blasting storm
of winter, till it sunk upon the outstretched branches of
its own shoot and scion.
It were a tedious, useless and unnecessary course to
pursue, to set forth at length the many passages, the
minute and tiresome proceedings of this mockery of a
trial,this false examination of the acts of Leisler; sooth,
it will be sufficient to state, that no form that might
strictly be considered legal was wanting; in that the
farce was played unto its uttermost. There was in this
investigation all the treachery of outward right to the
accused, but encountered by judicial subtleties; Leisler
was, with an apparent anxiety for fairness, forewarned of
that which was his service and privilege as an English
subject, only to be silenced when he applied the
arguments
pointed out to him, by the court's deeming them
inapplicable when used: nor was there, as may be
supposed
,
a lack of prepared testimony from the corrupt
lips of suborned or prejudiced witnesses, in whose partial
relation the simplest action and the purest intentions were
turned to manifest guiltiness. For, to some men the
sacred obligation of an oath, no matter how it affects the
life or fortune of a fellow, is but the bending of a straw,
the passing of breath, leaving no feeling unless that of
exultation at the triumph it achieved, in the vile breast
from which it took its being; albeit, with most the solemn
action of a vow, the bond of truth hath not the slightest
force or control; sooth, he that hath no veracity
withouten
these, nothing human or divine can bind: yet such
is nature, that there are but few when their interest is at
stake, or when guided by ill will or revenge, who will not
almost unknown to themselves, or at least without
premeditated
guidance, stretch their evidence to leave an
unfavourable impression against the object of those bitter
feelings, arguing even at the time, that they have spoken
uprightly and given that which was the fact, scarce
reflecting
that the words of good were weak and
evanescent
to the detail of evil; and then, too often man allows
himself to be borne away, like the forest bark on a
mountain
current, without either care, power, or will to stay
his impetuous way, by sudden impulse arisen from the
circumstance of the moment. An instant conceived
dislike
,
or startling envy, a hatred, to trace whose cause
were vain, have each their predominance, against which
there is no contention: the propensity of spiteful
retribution
to retaliate ancient injuries, when the opportunity
offers, is greedily snatched at; and man is wont at such
hours to be ravenous, and lacerate as the lion tears the
lamb, his defenceless prey. The principle too is
inherent
in the human formation, and animates at once the
high and the low to pull down all that they conceive soar
above them, either by good fortune or capacity; and
there is nought more than this that will stimulate the
most inveterate falsehood; for by railing at worth and
depreciating it with filthy lies, if not oftentimes its success
is marred, it at least eases of gall, with the idea, the
overflowing hearts of its enemies. Every
circumstance
,
therefore, that his direst foemen desired, was set
forth in its most vivid colourings against the hapless
prisoner; and if by chance, unmeant, aught in his
favour escaped, it was hastily glossed over until his
case resembled some dark and high wrought portrait
of deathof whose terrors so deep and lasting were the
horrors that struck the eyethat to them the whole
attention
was embound and entranced, so that scarce a
glance could be drawn to any redeeming quality or
relieving
pleasure that the conynge hand of the artist had
drawn to the groupings on his living canvass.And it was
easy to determine as this midnight tribunal drew fast to
the closing of the protracted sitting which engaged it,
by the cold and icy looks, and frowning and relentless
visages that peered upon the desolate and fallen, though
once proud and haughty burgomaster of Niew
Amsterdam
that
the majority of his judges were impatient to
give the last seal to his miserable fortune, and that if any
latent hope stirred within him (for that deserts but with
life,) it were vain to indulge its faithless whisperingsthe
harsh set features around him looked not of mercy or even
compassion: but it was not so with Leislerwell knew
he those whom he dealt with then, and he sought not idly
favours of men who were directed to spurn at him, and to
22*
whom it would have given glee to have had the chance to
refuse his beseeching.The old man sat at the bar firm
and unmoved, scarce showing by smile or word the scorn
he felt for the taunts of his adversaries, which were
allowed
by the Court to be showered on him; he attempted no
defence, he sought not to deprecate the wrath that burst
around his headfor he was taught it were useless as
shouting to the embattled elements: apparently a change
had come on the man in the trials he was now subject to,
which in his former life had been wantingthere was
indeed a natural constitutional obstinacy, the heirloom
of his dutch descent, which he possessed and which in
the hour of success in council he had exercised with all
the infatuation of ignorance to his own injury, but this
very defect seemed metamorphosed into a virtue, an
undaunted
firmness of bearing like the mighty hemlock the
wings of the tempest unbendingbut once, and that was
at the first, when demanded to answer to the truth of the
charges preferred against his life, he spoke as to the
cruelty
of urging on a trial against him unwarned, unnoticed,
and unpreparedof hurrying him from his dungeon as it
were to instant condemnation, without even the chance
given to the most infamous criminal for defence, of
reflection
,
of summoning such whose testimony might be
of service in contradiction of that which was false in the
accusations, and of consultation with his friends who might
advise on points which to him were unknown, or
unthought
ofand then Leisler finding these attempts for
time availed notfor with the most plausible and
sophistical
words his judges combatted and overwhelmed
all that he had offeredhe strove to justify his conduct
in seizing the government of the province, by insisting
that Lord Nottingham's letter entitled him to act in the
quality of Lieutenant Governor, and plead for himself
and adherents (many of whom he understood his own
trial was but the prelude to proceedings against) their zeal
and service for King Williambut when he found all he
had advanced was unattended with any impression, and
that those to whom he spoke listened weary and
impatient
,
he sank in silence resigned and expectant of the
worst that could be invented for his destruction;
deeming
it but waste of word and time to oppose the progress
of concerted action; not so his sonwith flushed cheek,
and quick and flashing eye Arnyte heard the garbled tale
of treachery woven to existence from the mouths of men,
many of whom had been the sycophantic spaniels who
had humbly licked the foot-prints of his father but a day
or so gone by, and these without to him apparent cause
for such base ingratitude, were most active and
inveterate
as though they desired to suck the blood of their
late patron, eager and contending for the first mouthful,
like wild dogs over the corse on a battle plain; he scarce
wotted that those who fawn the most, or who swear the
loudest of return for received gifts are the most hollow
and faithless, and are soon ready, if themselves are
vantaged
thereby, to change the tenor of their sounding oaths,
careless, an it serve their interest, if it destroy him whose
hand had raised them. The youth's heart beat quick, and
his lips trembled as he saw the barefaced slanders received
as reality; his choler rose within him, nor could he
control
the indignation that swelled his panting breast, and
like the rabid serpent of the east, leaping from the branch
where it had coiled itself in watch upon its incautious
prey, his quick and angered feelings burst forth at times
driving in their violence the appalled wretch against
whom his speech was directed to fearful silence; the
power of the Judges, the threats of the Court, could
scarce keep bounds upon his irritated temper.
Great God! do I stand among men who pretend to
civilization? cried the impetuous stripling, starting at
last astonished from his seat, his feelings inflamed to the
uttermost by an unblushing and unrelenting pursuance in
the Court of its arbitrary and unjust course of proceeding
towards the prisoner, the crisis of whose predetermined
condemnation was now evidently fast approaching: Great
God! do I stand among men who pretend to civilization?
exclaimed he with passionate warmth, and with a voice
whose sound kindled in strength to later manhood: or
is this an assemblage of heathen salvages, the infidels of
the wilderness, wearing the human form, yet lacking its
virtues,holding the life of a creature but as the wild
hart they slay for sport? can it be, that here among
christian
men, words and the relation of deeds, to which the
safety of a human being is enchained are played with at
will, and that grave jurists, experienced in mankind and the
laws can drink in palpable falsities, contrary to their own
knowledge,adverse to reason, with all the thirstiness of
the foul kite sucking the gore of its slain victim? Is there
no power, no justice in the land to whom appeal can
come; but shall the innocent perish by the tainted breath
of such whose very touch is as the leper, making
poisonous
and rotten the wholesome air in which they move?
Can this be intended, or is it but some grave pastime
at which ye are amused withal, that on, the which hath
been set out against Jacob Leisler ye mean to proceed to
judgment, an sothese ye have construed are fine
customs
,
rare edicts, that read so well for the accused yet
act against him.
You are presumptuous, young man, thus unwarranted
to invade, with rude license of speech, the deliberation
of this tribunal; quoth Sir Thomas Robinson, sternly,
your hastiness, young Sir, tendeth not in advantage to
the accused, to whom lenity is shown that you are not
now taken from his sidealbeit, his apparent weakness
of health seeketh thy arms' support:my froward master,
this Court knoweth what is proper in its procedures
withouten your sage invective or angry stricturesI pray
ye an ye look to the consequence of your words, keep
silence! we seek not to exercise the powers vested in us
to your harm, though ye have braved them more than
once; therefore bide ye still. After he thus
reprehended
the youth, the judge turned to his associates and
continued
:
having now, Sirs, the full evidence of this
matter
of accusation against Jacob Leisler before you, I call
on you brothers of this Court for your sentiments
thereon
,
as to the guilt or innocence of this man, and whether
if you agree as to the crime, there hath been enough
produced
for us to found the punishment usual to the offence
of treasondeath! How say ye, Sirs?
I pray ye, my learned masters, to bear with me but a
moment, again interrupted Arnyte, greatly alarmed, and
blanched with terror at the words of the judge, at the same
time struck with the truth conveyed in the rebuke he
had received, and becoming aware instantly that his
incautious
and unadvised bearing was truly more calculated
to increase the imminent danger of him for whose safety
his heart yearned than to aid him: I pray ye to bear with
me, Sirs, and pardon the rashness that hath given vent
thus to my fault, and hear me ere you proceed to pronounce
on the offences that have been charged against Jacob
Leislerhear me, grave Sirs, I pray ye, he continued,
for I am a child, pleading for his parent, and by that holy
tie of kindred, than which on earth there lives none
stronger, an ye have one touch of nature in ye, ye will
listen with patience to that which I urge, and though
mayhap
aught presumptuous escape me, be not prejudiced
against him for whom I speak, or offended thereat, but
set it down to the unguarded warmth of my green youth,
sore touched at heart by the miseries of my family; set
it down, I pray ye, Sirs, to the anxiety that moves me
for the life and welfare of him from whose loins I have
sprangwho from the seed to the shoot hath
succoured
,
tended, and protected me, and to whom, next
to God, I am indebted for being. I do not mean,
neither will I, sirs, speak any thing to injure those
who have taken the pains to make so foul that
beloved
friend; neither will I urge on you that he hath
been a good and faithful servant of our lord the king
though that and even more might I insist on. Neither
will I ask of you the law or the statute that teacheth
what is and what is not treason, for it would be unwise in
one so wanting in years like me, to demand of you, old
and sage as you are, where is the mark, the token upon
the crime which ye have placed up against Jacob Leisler.
In troth, from want of knowledge, briefness of days,
experience
,
and above all the trembling of this heart, which
like a frightened bird beating in alarm at its wiry prison,
throbs against my side with quick and rapid motion of
fear, I am unmeet at time like this to be my father's
advocate
;
yet of this great principle, which from the cradle
we are taught, it is mine to remind you onbe wary how
from the image of your Creator you take away life; for
that of which you rob it you can never make restoration:
remember sirs, I beseech of you, in this trying time, the
wide difference between accusers, prosecutors, and
judges. How misbecoming in the latter character is
that heat of temper, desire and fervour for triumph,
which are so praiseworthy and commendable in the
conduct
of the two former situations. It is good, it is
honest
,
yea most noble, to work hand and heart to discover
iniquity, to drag the truth to light; but when that great
end is accomplished, every passion that warmed inquiry
should be dismissed, and those to whom the judgment
thereupon is given ought to be calm, unstirred and
cautious
for
in this the fiat ye are deeply responsible;
better
every hair of your heads were twined by the grave
worms, than that your judgment should be biassed
that ye should sport the blood of a fellow being to satiate
hate, prejudice, or revengefor to God Almighty have
ye to reckon for its rectitude or obliquity; nor can ye
say when called, like Cain of the olden day, ye are not
your brother's keeper; for like then blood will smoke
from the earth against ye, and ye will be forced to give a
strict account for every drop to whose shedding ye have
been the remotest accessors: for the judge is God's own
steward, and if in the scale of justice he cast a grain of
sand, bitter shall he rue it. If this be not hearkened to,
(but there is a mark on the door of my house like the
plague were within, forbidding all to enter,but to shun
the death cry of its chambers,) if the doom is set, oh
bethink
of what will be said hereafter! let not the curses of
posterity light on your memory; let not men as they
cross your graves spurn the sod that covers your relics,
repeating as a stigma which will descend from generation
to generation, like a disease of the blood, that ye were
injust judges or corrupted men. No! the rather now let
every man of this court lay his hand upon his heart, and
seriously consider that which he is a-going to do with a
single
breath, yea, with the breath of his nostrils, the gift of his
maker, he is about to do justice, or (start not, for it is so)
he is about to commit murder. Nay, frown not, sirs, but
hear me out, I will not trespass long; ye have the choice
justice on one side, and rank murder on the other, with
all its heightened and aggravated features; for he that,
led by thirst of plunder madly takes the life of the
traveller
,
is light of crime, to the cool and deliberate judge
that giveth knowingly a wrongful sentence:the first
doubtless commits a mighty sin, but the last is impious
in his crime, for he applies the ordinance of God to suit
his bloody purpose. Sooth sirs, I pray ye purge your
hearts from all evil passions in this business, and ere ye
utter forth your opinions cleanse your minds of every foul
affection, even as ye would the glassy surface of your
eyes when shaping to the discernment some distant and
doubtful form, from every mote which the wind casts on
the tender vision to impede its subtleness: take heed, I
seek of ye that your intentions be not pretincted by
blight, shade, or colourbeware, I charge on ye that ye
look not with a blood-shotten eye on that which ye are
to make up judgment on; remember that ye are but men,
weak and liable to err, and that he whom ye are to
pronounce
on is your fellow, against whom there should be with
you no corruptive of justiceno personal animosity should
with a righteous man weigh a grain in the scale; no
greedy desire of popularityno thirst of flatteries to the
multitude, should animate the bosom of any one of ye
banish from the places where you set to decide on life or
death, all principle of selfish fear, that by sparing blood
ye will incense those to whom the accused is odious
let it not be an ingredient in your sentence that by
mildness to him ye endanger yourselvesfear not that
while Jacob Leisler breathes the life of any one of ye is
not in safety, so that ye hasten his death by so fell a
thought; yea sirs, I do beseech of ye to discharge your
duty before God, so that ye may look on your work with
a clear consciencefor on the effect of this solemn
protestation
depends not alone the life, fame, and fortune of
my beloved father who stands before you, but the
existence
of one whom you must allow most innocent; I have
another parent to whom the tidings of your sentence brings
joy or wo unutterable, andpardon, my learned masters,
these rebel tears that wet my cheeksof that which I
may suffer myself I will not trouble you. I had a word
more to say, but am choaked with sorrowI have not
strength further to speaksirs, I have done, bidding ye
again, ere I close my lips, to wash your hands and your
souls of innocent blood.
As Arnyte commenced this appeal to the uprightness
of the court, his manner was fearful and timorous, his
actions
hurried and agitated, and his utterance faint, low,
and broken, and the gasping and somewhat convulsive
efforts with which he endeavoured to gain composure,
were plainly perceptible, with the husky tones of his
voice and the tremor of his limbs; but as he proceeded
onward his confidence apparently increasedand though
ever and anon between the pauses of his speech his lips
trembled and his outstretched hand shook violently, as
the young branches of a tree disturbed by the autumnal
wind, yet his colour heightened and his eye blazed with
a steadier light, and the sound of his words was full and
strong, and flowed boldly forth, like the mighty current
of some noble stream; and there was a solemn bearing in
his mien, that for the time was felt by the most
ironhearted
of the judges; for as he stood with foot advanced
and head thrown back, and every limb and feature
swelling
with the feeling that stirred him, he looked like one
inspired beyond his years, a forewarning messenger
calling
on men about committing ill, to pause upon their
wickedness:nor did his courage fail him until he drew
nigh to the close of that which he had spoken, then his
own words disturbed him with the horrid pictures that
followed them abruptly in his sensitive imagination; and
as he continued, his cheek grew paler and paler, and every
muscle was moved, and in spite of his attempts to restrain
them, big and beaded drops coursed each other down his
face, until overcome as it were for the moment, he paused
ere he pursued his discourse, to recruit his waning powers
in one strong effort, which he breathed forth in the last
sentence to which he commended the attention of his
father's
judges.
When Arnyte had finished speaking there succeeded
an interval, during which there was scarce perceptible
voice, stir, or motion throughout that apartmentit was
an awful pause of conviction for the minute, mingled with
a breathless anticipation of that which might thereafter
chance. Some, who at the first words of the youth had
drawn up their lips with ireful scorn, and prepared to
listen to that which he should offer with cold and hasty
indifference, but of which little remained long ere they
heard him through, now sat motionless, with eye and
attention rivetted on the youthful suppliant, as though
bound by the magic spell of an enchanter, melted down
from the iron confidence of their intended determination,
stricken, wavering and irresolute, with minds startled
and amazed to wonderment, devouring, as it were with
greediness, the warm and thrilling memory of the
stripling's
deprecation, as though it had been a sweet and
touching sound of mistrelsy and song, that had so wrought
on the tender chords of the heart, that though the melody
itself had departed and died in the distance, it seemed as
if perception yet lingered and reigned upon the spirit;
but this endured not;the slight affection of the moment
passed away like summer rain drops on a bleak and
barren
rock, leaving behind neither warmth nor kindliness:
for, bursting the thrall that for the time enchained the
thoughts of the judges, there uprose the worst enemy
Leisler had in the court, and with a malicious, yet cunning
tongue, he hastened to goad the serpent hate to ire from
the sleep in which it had been lulled; he laboured to recall
to the recollection of those around him, with vivid and
skilful description, yet concealing outwardly every
sinister
motive for his sentiments,all that was condemned,
detested and envied in the accused as the grounds of the
opinion which he gave, at the same time expressing in
indignant terms of resentment his apprehension of the
presumptuous boldness, the endurance of which, as he
said, was a matter of surprise, by a court conscious of its
own dignity, of that insolent and unabashed boy who had
dared dictate to the learned and chosen of the land, and
insult them with suggestions unfavourable to their
uprightness
Vol. II. 23
and honesty as men and as judges;for to what
else, pursued the speaker, aims his discourse, but that
he hath doubts of the impartiality, firmness and virtue of
this tribunal? yea, continued he, this malapert
stripling
beseeches neither from us mercy or compassion, but
hath addressed this court as though it were composed of
malefactors, men ready,ay, even now baring the
murtherous
knife to the throat of the passive and inoffensive
victim; forsooth, why passeth he so glaring an insult on
wise and prudent judges, unswayed by aught that can
interfere with their sworn duty, an it be not that he hopes
by this imprudent strain to make us appear venal and
corrupt partisans, using the name and shadow of our
offices to suit our personal enmity?to this point
palpably
he alone hath laboured, thinking since so lightly
he hath touched on the crimes of the accused, that
by stamping the court with sin he covers the
prisoner's
guilt; and this disrespect is the less excusable
in the wilful chatterling, seeing that he lacketh not
sense, but hath the ability and knowledge to act a
better partbut nathless, withal Sirs he is youngyoung,
a mere child, heedless and unthinking mayhap of the full
construction of that which he hath ventured forthI
pray ye sirs to pardon him therefore, and attribute his
rashness to his immaturity, and want of experience
besides
the boy hath been warmed naturallyfor it is his
parent's cause which hath awakened his wordsit is not
therefore worth time to dwell upon the matter longer:but
I will proceed to state that as the proof appears to me, it
is evident the measures pursued by Jacobus Leisler
during
the latter part at least of his power, together with
his dissolving the late Convention, and imprisoning
divers
reputable persons inhabitants of the province, and
subjects of the kingdom of England are tumultuous,
illegal
,
and against their majesties' right, and greatly do I
fear that the late heart-rending and appalling tragedythe
slaughter and fire at Schenectadie by the salvages, are
mainly to be attributed to his unlawful and injudicious
osurpation of all power, for which he hath had no
authority
save the promptings of vile and inordinate
ambition
,
and moreover I do protest against the forcible
seizure
and confiscation of the effects of sundry persons,
and against the unauthorized levying of money on their
majesties' liege subjects in the manner the same hath
been done by this man, and I do not hesitate to say that
his holding the fort against his Excellency Colonel
Sloughter, the governor, is an open and intended act of
rebellion
for which alone the severest punishment that can be
inflicted he deserves to suffer: viewing things in this light,
however painful it may be to me as a man situated as I am
a neighbour for years, an acquaintance of the accused
yet before God my duty as a citizen and a judge must be
performed, and which I trust to the latest period of my
existence
I shall discharge with a pure conscience, and that
my judgment in this affair shall be consonant to the best
of my understanding in all integrity; I must say, that I
do consider that the life of a traitor is but poor
atonement
for his offence, which is heinousbeing against his
sovereign, his benefactor, and his country; and as this
case stands I solemnly protest I acquit myself honestly
thereby in asserting that on candid and cool deliberation
I declare for the death of the criminal.
The determination of the generality of mankind hath
its source not from reason or positive conviction of right,
but rather from prepossession, from desire which
oftentimes
(as in the case of the judges of Leisler,) is formed
before hearing a just and fair representation of the
matter
to be deliberated onif the wish of the heart be for
acquittal or condemnation, where is the mind of man
(though elevated on the judgment seat, which weak and
presuming creatures of mortality have raised, a mockery
of their Creator, where folly and obduracy, infamy and
corruption are enthroned to pronounce the vain edicts
of social order, as it is called, the technical trickeries
that men term law and justice:) that can resist the
predominant
biasa doubt, a hesitation, it is admitted of the
soundness of such inclination by truth and plausible
argument
may be raised for the time, if the intention of the
hearer be honestyet the hold of this is feeble and soon
banished if the predetermination can be borne out by
sentiments
that appear reasonable on the surface, though the
face be hollow as a mask, yet the partial feeling will succour
its unworthiness until it seemeth reality to the ready sight
indeed the appetite is ravenous, and earnestly and
anxiously
searches out support for the inclination which
taketh pains to banish all that interferes with its bent.
Albeit from such cause fled the late awakened compassion
towards the prisoner from the breast of the Court, and
an eager accordance was rendered by the judges to the
opinion and words last expressed by their comate; one
alone of the tribunal seemed to pause as if scarce
satisfied
that the course now strenuously urged, by the others
associated in his power, to be pursuedas if the dire and
fatal judgment which would devolve on him to give unto
the accused as principal of the Court, was adverse to his
sense of right:in truth the mind of Sir Thomas
Robinson
was like one of those cold, sluggish and icy streams
which no wind can stir, nor agitates more than a ruffle of its
waves, which heavily subside in motion almost as soon
as rousedneither vindictive nor compassionate even in
this time of popular excitement, it mattered little to his
private feelings whether clearance or punishment awaited
the accusedlaggard in idea, he neither snatched like
his fellows at the arguments proposed against the prisoner
nor sought he out any matter in favourbut like most
men of his formation of intellect at once obstinate and
dispassionate, he had seized on a thought which had
been offered in the course of the examination as a ground
of opinion, and on that he had based himself, and he was
neither therefrom to be moved by aught either fair in
reason or otherwise, for his was a nature that prided
itself
in being unbending and unwavering in its integrity.
Sirs of this court, quoth he, with patience I have
listened to that which ye have presented as your different
opinions in this business; and it is a matter wherein I
trust I am in nowise misled by a wrongful judgment,
seeing
that in all we agree not; for that I am not able to
side in full with youI will give you therefor my
inducements
,
informing first that assuredly the acts as charged
and made out against Jacob Leisler, are of themselves,
excluding every collateral matter, criminal and rebellious
and in the next, as they stand, the sentence which the
most of this court have decided on, is just; all this I
grant. Nathless ye will remember, sirs, the prisoner
hath asseverated in behalf of his own innocence, the which
in my mind I am unable to do away, that in the exercise
of his gubernatorial sway of this province and its
dependencies
,
he was authorized by a certain letter from the
lords Caermarthen and Halifax, directed to `Francis
Nicholson
,
Esq., or in his absence to such as for the time
being take care for preserving the peace and
administering
the laws in their majesties' province of New-Yorke, in
America;' which letter is dated the twenty-ninth of July,
1689, accompanying that of Lord Nottingham to
Nicholson
,
dated the next day, empowering him, Nicholson, to
take upon himself the chief command (Colonel Dongan,
our late governor, having sailed for London on his recall,)
and to appoint for his assistance as many of the
freeholders
and inhabitants of the province as he should see fit,
requiring also to do every thing appertaining to the office
of Lieutenant Governor, according to the laws and
customs
of New-Yorke, until further orders. Now sirs,
though it may be urged that these could not apply to the
prisoner, he having seized on the government by force,
and driven Nicholson, the person first addressed in the
documents alluded to from the countryhe, Leisler,
albeit
it must be confessed was then the person who for
the time being held the reins of the government, and
this is the letter of the address on the packet; now
this fact may not be a strict inference, the accused being
not regularly or lawfully chosen to the place he then
filled
;
yet the success of the Protestant cause in some
measure
excuses the means of his elevation, and putteth an
equity about his defence; on this head, to avoid and
prevent
what may be a rash decision otherwise, I declare
myself in doubt, and ask your minds more freely and full
thereon; for let us not wantonly, or rather ignorantly,
dip our hands in blood; let us not be lost in any
licentiousness
of feeling against the prisoner, but seek alone to
administer justice. And therein I promise myself, if
enlightened
23*
of that which I have thrown out, to forget all
except my duty in the vindictiveness of the law against
the guilty: but at present to accord with you under my
hesitation, would be like driving a dagger in a healing
wound, the which I cannot think on without trembling.
Sirs, let the judgment we determine be like my Lord
Bacon said of the laws of Henry IV., not made upon
the spur of particular occasion for the present, but out of
providence for the future.
Sir Thomas Robinson having thus freely delivered the
feelings that weighed on his mind, a long discussion
ensued
among the members of the court relative thereto;
in the course of which the unrelenting adversaries of the
prisoner growing warm and irritable from the hindrance
likely to arise to their views of an early determination of
Leisler's career, in the doubts expressed as to the guilt
of their victim by the principal judge, ardently and
obstreporously
exerted themselves, at times almost to
anger
when unsuccessful, to convince him of the hollowness
of that which he had advanced, or rather to overwhelm
his hesitation to accede to that which they so earnestly
desired, with a torrent of sophistry and of sounding words;
but like most arguments with persons at once obstinate
and opinionative, this was unfruitful of success; from the
very heat in which the opposition was urged, Sir Thomas
gathered new strength for the ground he assumed, and
the greater the endeavours the less he was convinced.
There are of that kind, who though the stand in
disputation
they have chosen be utterly untenable, and
adverse
to reason itself, yet out of pure stubbornness of
nature
,
or from a spirit disliking to be subdued and
acknowledge
error, will not yield, even though o'erborne by
numbers and by truth; but will carp and hang on trifles
and inaccuracies picked from the discourses of those with
whom they are contending; like the shipwrecked
mariner
,
who while in vain he hath strove to seize the sides
of the slippery crag itself to draw him from the deep,
whose hungry and devouring waves are roaring round
him, in the madness of despair in a last effort, snatches
with wild hopes of success at the sea plant, and the moss
that grows upon its slimy surface, as if there was support
for life in things so tender, frail, and feeble, and which
tear and break at a touch.
Of a species allied to the one last described was Sir
Thomas Robinson; nathless in the present position he had
much of sense to bear him out; nor was the harsh and
eager manner with which the others laboured to
enforce
their wishes, favourable with him to the
attainment
:
indeed so far did it lose effect as to make
those ideas which at first were wavering and
indefinite
,
apparently mere creatures of the moment, thoughts
bound to consciencelike seated rocks that dive with
deep embedded roots in the dark earth, fearless and
unshaken by hurricane or tempest rainand besides
adverse to the desire of the Bayard faction, there were
those whom the obstinacy and firmness of Sir Thomas
worked on, among such as had already declared in favour
of the course that had been proposed against Leisler's
lifefor there are many who will assent to the most
preposterous
or monstrous matter started to them, finding it
undisputed, either incited by a carelessness of disposition,
unapt to reflection, or from a timidness of temperament
to be alone a dissenter from what is agreed on by every
body else, who, when there starts out one bold enough
to attack the doctrine, will either waver from or openly
desert the side which they had at the commencement
blindly or unthinkingly enlisted on. The anti Leslerians
soon perceiving that several of their partizans were
growing
cold in the cause, and apparently were desirous of
moderate measures towards the accused, while others,
pricked by remorse, were unsettled and wandering from
that which heretofore had been fixed in their resolution,
became fearful lest by some untoward circumstance
their prey might yet escape them; and being induced
by this thought, the leaders having, among themselves,
unperceived by the rest of the Court, interchanged a
brief and sudden counsel, insidiously, and to appearance,
reluctantly, to gain their ends, accorded with the doubts
which Sir Thomas had honestly expressed, and
appeared
thoroughly convinced, having changed for the mo
ment their intended career, that there was an intricate
question arising on the point that had been started, which
they were unable to give a fair decision on; and after
flattering
the discrimination of Sir Thomas, they prompted
fresh difficulties, until he himself and his party wearied
and unable to decide in any way, of their own accord
proposed
what, however, had first been cunningly suggested
by the foes of Leisler, that the part of the prisoner's
defence
from which their controversy had taken its source,
should be referred to the governor and council, praying
their opinion whether the letter of the lords Caermarthen
and Halifax, or any other letters or papers, in the
packet
from Whitehall could be understood or interpreted to
be or contain any power or direction to Captain Leisler,
to take the government of the province upon himself, or
that the administration thereupon be holden good in law;
[24]
[24]
Smith's History of New-York, page 99.
and it was settled, that in case the reference was
answered
in the negative, that Leisler was guilty of the crime of
high treason and should be condemned to expiate that
offence upon the scaffold. In this artifice, the enemies
of the accused obtained their triumph completely, for
they were well aware of their success in the question,
for the bitterest foemen of Leisler were now alone to
speak, and it requires but little foresight to believe that
where malice and inveterate hate were to determine a less
questionable reliance, than on which hung the life of the
accused would be o'erborne; nathless, at the same time
they whispered themselves confidently that their own
actions would tell better, and such as pretended to a
delicacy
of conscience, although they well knew the
catastrophe
that was to follow, flattered themselves no blame
hereafter could be theirs, that the direful weight of crime,
if any there was, had been heaped on the shoulders of
others, and that they had pursued a prudent and honest
course; for with such selfish principles doth a little and
narrow minded man entrench and satisfy himself on his
own conduct, seeing with his prejudices, and caring for
himself alonein such a limited light, in that one single
contracted point of view did the judges of Leisler look
on the procedure by which they became accessaries to
his fate, nor bore in mind the vivid and plain circumstances
that were combined with the act, which while they plumed
themselves on their impartiality, rendered them parties
in guilt; for to the most unwilling, there was evident but
one construction of the act with which the Court
concluded
this trial, and that could not be otherwise than
unfavourable, setting the participators in the proceedings
down as either ignorant or sycophants; for they had
certainly
performed the parts of the sluth hounds, who, after
driving the game in the huntsman's ring, from which there
was no escape, stand by panting with delight while the
knife is drawn across the throat of the deer, eager and
rejoicing in the portion of the spoil which their masters
might award them for their activity and exertion in
their service; and now having in this manner
determined
the fate and trial of Leisler, the Court rose to
dissolve
its sitting; and it was commanded, that ere the
judges departed from their seats, that the prisoner should
be conducted back to the cell wherein he had heretofore
been confined, but that additional care should be taken in
his guard, and that like one past condemnation, he should
be strongly and heavily ironed, and no one on any account
whatever, except with a special order, should be allowed
admittance or intercourse with him, but that his dungeon
should be cleared of its other miserable inhabitants, that
his durance might be lone and solitary, as that of a man
sentenced to suffer death.
Long ere the court broke up from its arduous and
wearisome task of deliberation, the light of the lantern
by which they were assembled waned and flickered with
heavy and broken beams; while striking through the
gloom and shadow of the apartment, there darted from
the chinks and vents cut in the shape of half moons in
the casement shutters, bright and vivid gleams
proclaiming
that day had dawned without. A pleasure came even
in the midst of his wretchedness with the coming
morning
,
to the seared heart of Leisler, for another night,a
fearful night to him had passed,a night of oppression,
ignominy and suffering; and that which he might have
expected had happened, his veriest doubts had been
assured, and it now became him to play the part alone
which should not hereafter be a reproach to his name;
but otherwise with the sorrow-stricken Arnyte;in his
misery he noted not the flitting hours, and when he
heard the hoarse voice of the jailer bid his father arise
from the place whereon he had sat during the trial, and
follow him to his prison-house, he with an involuntary
motion started forward to accompany him, but was sternly
forbid;then with a piteous bewailing, like the infant
torn from its mother, he besought, as he clung to his
father's garment, the allowance of the court to proceed
with him to his incarceration, but he was rudely and
harshly denied the favour he so earnestly requested;
and although again and again he appealed to the personal
commiseration of the judges, the more determinately and
angrily was his perseverance repelled, and he was
constrained
with a heart, whose heavy throbbings shook his
bosom nigh to bursting, in its fearful agony, though with
an eye parched and tearless, to gaze on the departing step
of his father, as he quitted the fatal apartment wherein
he had been judged so partially, to proceed with slow and
mournful pace to the dark cell, which the foreboding mind
of Arnyte pictured as the last resting place,the
only habitation wherein he was to reside with life; and
as the hollow and dismal clanking of a massy weight of
chains already prepared to load the limbs of the
unfortunate
prisoner, and carried at his side by one of the jailer's
assistants, struck on the anxious hearing of the youth, the
sharp sound pierced to his very brain, like the warning
tollings of a funereal bell; and when he beheld Leisler
cross the threshold of the doorway that led from the
room, his overwhelming grief of soul burst its bounds,
and for the moment he could not restrain the wild
promptings of nature; but in spite of encircling guards,
fierce looks, and threatening words, he rushed after the
parent from whom he had been severed, and snatching
his hand, he pressed it with a long and convulsive
motion
,
now to his breast, and now to his quivering lip,
until thrust back by ungentle hands and ruder force; and
when thus at last torn from his trembling hold, he met a
sad, lorn, lingering look which his father as he was
hurried
away from him cast back, the deep and touching
expression of that speechless glance came over him like
a withering blow from the wild and darting lightninghe
stood as one frozen to the spot, powerless and inanimate,
with vision strained and gazing on a receding object, in
which every faculty was wrought and magnetized, like
the spirit in the first moments of departure, turning
towards the loved ones of earth whom it is leaving, as it
were for evermore; and when his receding form was
nearly lost to the sight, beneath the darksome shadows of
the ponderous architraves under which he and such as
guarded him passed, and as they disappeared in the long,
narrow and gloomy way, they seemed as though
swallowed
in the jaws of the tomb, and when he could
distinguish
no trace, when even the echo of the distant
footsteps
was silent,then, as one wounded to the death by
the sudden blow of an unseen enemy, as though stricken
by a blight from the air on which he breathed, the
stripling
sank powerless for support against the portals of the
door by which he stood, and involuntarily a groan of
bitter
anguish escaped his utterance.
The apartment wherein the court had been held for
Leisler's trial was now fast deserted; one by one of
those who loitered retired each to his way; few even as
they passed him in departure cared to notice the situation
of the desolate offspring of the man, the work of whose
fate they had been busied on so late. Some there might
have been who threw on him a look of pity, but that
scarce ever was lasting more than while he interfered
with the vision;the next object the sight fell upon
engrossed the mind to forgetfulness;the feeling was
like the minute whisperings of humanity, that go not to
the disturbance of the selfish heart, from whence they
emanate; and yet there were those whose undisguised
rejoicings of triumph over the fall of Jacobus Leisler
were vented without mercy on the youth, regardless of
his sufferings, which were viewed with the same pleasure
by these as a wanton and cruel urchin delights in the
agonies and miserable palpitations of the quivering and
heaving portions of the worm, whose body his knife hath
cut and lacerated, and through each parted member of
which is running the last and dying throe: but Arnyte,
buried in anguish, listened not to their cold and sneering
contumelies, and they, disappointed in meeting such
passiveness
,
where was sought fire for fuel to excuse severer
injuries, moved on, leaving the youth lone and neglected.
Arnyte heard them not as they left him, for a faintness
was on him, and sense, sight and hearing fast failed, and
suffocating emotions shook his frame, as though he had
been grasped by a giant's hand;he must have dropped
upon the vaulted floor, but for the assistance of some
kind and piteous stranger, whom he wotted not in his
moment
of agony. He was led forth without the stadthuis
walls, scarce weening of a step he took; nor was it until
he drank the fresh and morning breeze from the pure
heavens, undefiled, that the weakness of nature gave
itself forth, and his voiceless struggles were past; for
then broke out agonized sobs from his labouring breast,
and tears quick and fast, in beaded drops, wrung like
blood from his heart strings, coursed down his cheeks in
wo;he wept aloud, and his surcharged bosom found
relief, like the earth long dried and parched by burning
suns of summer, and waterless from enduring drought,
receiving in its fainting bosom the cooling rain, the
gentle
dew and offering of the pitying clouds.
SECTION III.Proceeded in.
It
was a mild and beautiful morning, that spoke not of
the dark winter whose reign had commenced, but shone
like the deceiving colour on the visage of the sick, which
misleads with hope when it should foretell the dank grave
and the funeral hearse. Few traces remained of the rage
of the late tempest, and these seemed like the tears on
the cheek of beauty, smiling even in her sorrow; the
fresh air, redolent with life, balm and joya very thing
of intelligence, breathing health and vigour to man and
nature's renovation, fanned the broad surface of the living
wave, disporting with the pulses of the moving waters,
lifting and spreading out their swelling bosoms, like a
warrior
in his hour of dalliance, playing with amorous hand
in the silken locks of his betrothed; while the gay and
laughing light of the young sunbeam danced joyously o'er
the snow and ice embound hill and dale, making them
blaze as strewn with multitudinous gems, diamond and
rose hued; and its genial warmth penetrated
unchecked
among the high walls and peaked and blackened
roofs, and clustering chimneys of the city, from whose
tiled pinnacles the wreaths of the melting and decaying
sleet, that like a shroud had covered them, rose like
incense
to the shrine of the day godearth, sky and water
were as animated by one sensation of happiness and
festival
.
The hour of the day was already somewhat advanced,
and the narrow streets of the city were fast awakening to
their accustomed bustle, and in quick succession the
stirring
burghers poured forth from their habitations,
delighting
in the clamour and noise their own eager and busy
movements caused. The smart winkelier was arraying
in the most tempting form his wares to the eye of the
passing saunterer; while the shrill and lively notes of the
thriving matron, with voice at topmost key, were heard
from the sanded entries of each awakened dwelling,
startling
the half roused and nodding negro to his labour, and
with its fearful sound frightening for the time his laziness
of nature; here and there at the latticed window might
be descried, fair and lovely as the flowers she tended,
with cheek painted with the tint of health, some bashful
maiden, who with soft white hand was cherishing and
supporting
the fallen and drooping tendrils of her favourite
plants, amid the odorous waftings of whose delicious
fragrance
she moved, a being of light, and life, and youthful
beauty; indeed at this time of the year, in honour of the
approaching `Nieuw Jaar,' there were but few of the
Dutch mansions of the city of New-Yorke, within whose
Vol. II. 24
walls there did not flourish such bloemates as care and
tenderness
can preserve in the coldest seasons in bud, bloom
and perfume. In the casements of the richer class might
be seen leaden vases and urns, with large chased
portraitures
of fat and jolly divinities who figured in the heathen
mythology, or the more patriotic representations of the
pride of the Netherland arts and arms, the busts of the
De Witts, De Ruyter, or Von Tromp, with triumphal
wreaths, flags, trumpets, and all the paraphernalia of fame
these, placed on low and painted stands, were filled
with the rarest and most beautiful artimesias, tulips,
and greenhouse exotics of priceless value, each bulb
having
its name painted beneath it in large staring letters of
yellow and gilt. And albeit the domiciles of the poorer
sort lacked not the votive circlet for their halls, the
ever-green
,
the furred branches of the cedar tree, and the
misletoe. All within the prosperous precincts of Nieuw
Amsterdam appeared moving and aroused to business
none hugged the hot and sickly comfort of the couch,
except
the sluggish idler or heavy drunkard, and in those days
there were not many of that kind of miserable wretches
for as now, it was not made a boast either for late hours,
high feasting, or deep drinkingand it was a bad excuse,
that weighed but little with his crusty Dutch
bos
, for his
apprentice to plead sickness from debauchery for late
attendance
to his duty. The young men were about
hitching
their horses to their bowl shaped sleds, cracking their
whips or hailing each other in tones as loud, clear, and
melodious as the music that was drawn by the nose of
Handel, from the great organ at Harlm. Outwardly,
none bore the impress of the hand of grief, as each one
busied in his avocation, hurried on, though at times the
visage might have deceived by hollow smiles, when the
soul was in agony, that the keen eye of observance
marked not the shadow of existing sorrow;all was
apparently
thoughtless, light of heart, and happy. Arnyte
stood without the walls of his father's prison, and looked
on,a lone and solitary being, seeming as one unnoted
unregarded, unperceived, and neglected, as it were, by
friends and foes.
The sun shone down in its golden gleam of splendour,
the breath of heaven,the murmur of the wave
spoke not strange music to the ear,the faces of men
were unchanged,the world seemed not altered in its
pursuits, and yet the fall of Leisler, a thing of yesterday,
appeared erased from men's minds, as though years had
rolled over it. Nathless, conjectures of his fate were
made in the presence of his child, with cold, calculating
indifference, as it were the death of a worm,a
creature
of neither care, price, or estimation, that was
debated
:
few mourned the event, still fewer cared to hope
or to speak in terms of favour either of the unfortunate
man, or of his acts;his very family were condemned
with him; they were regarded as a part of the criminal;
and if an eye of pity glanced for the moment's curiosity
on his solitary and deserted son, it was withdrawn as soon
and abrupt, as fearful of being discovered, albeit if
an ill deed or punishable offence had been committed.
Arnyte, however, deadened in his feelings to exterior
subjects by the anguish of his mental afflictions, still
could not but notice that he was the object of
neglect
and scrutiny from others,neglect from such as
he of right might claim in the day of his distress,
attendance
and that relief which in them lay, as the
remembered
familiars of the decayed fortune of his house,as
the moths who fluttered in life about the light of his
prosperityscrutiny from those whose unseen
observance
with jealous eye, snake-like, drank in his every
motion, watchful, lest any incident should arise to change
the current of the fate of his doomed family, from means
or guile wherewith uncertain chance should arm him,
even in his present weakness. The first looked with
strange sight on him, or reckless turned their backs from
the glance of greeting, as the wassailer from the
new-covered
grave of his mate, to seek the revel, the appetite
for whose wine and harlotry lives keener in his thoughts
than the fresh-closed coffin of his companion; while
the last, with the heedful caution of suspicion that
trembles
at a whisper, like the fragile leaf of the anemone,
noted the minutest circumstance of his action. The
pride of the youth arose, mingling with his sorrows a
divided flood of despair and the bitterness of
misanthrophy
;
he felt the cheerlessness of his situation, that
placed him like an all-shunned beggar, (whose unbandaged
sores beget disgust and scorn,) a being of contempt alone;
and the lofty spirit that lived within the stripling's
breast, though borne down with its load of grief, yet
started from its lowliness of sufferance, and eagle-like,
sprang upwards from the pressure of the foot of
contumely
.He
gave with moistened vision one last, long,
lingering look at departure on the dreary walls, within
whose prison confines his parent lay in durance; nor
raised he his sight from that object, until his very soul,
as it were, had leaped from the orbs with which he
gazed, as he would have joined through bars and stone,
him whom they unconsciously severed from his embrace.
And as he wended him onwards in his solitary way, ever
and anon, while the place was yet to be descried, he
would involuntarily, by starts, cast back a piteous glance
towards it, as one who is forced from a casket wherein a
precious jewel is bestowed. He wandered onwards
without
a goal, careless whithersoe'er he bent his regardless
steps, so as he fled from the presence of ingrateful man;
for his young heart was weary and sick of his unkindness.
He moved with a wild, unmeasured pace through the
busy streets, as one that took no part of the living throng
that crowded them, but as a solitary, phantom-like thing
wrapt within himself, who, while all others hurried to
and fro in their directed race, each busied in some
particular
care of the day was lonely and deserted, brooding
o'er deep and silent spells of inward thought, reckless of
the outward group that passed him in his meditation.
Fearful in the moment of his abstraction were the
picturings
of his imagination; ingenious in the invention of
torments to his lacerated feelings, and unbroken by
dreams of hope or confidence,there swam before his
eyes visions of death, cruel and harrowing, of which vain
were endeavours to dispersethe bloody scaffold,
the gore dripping axe,the dim, terrible figure of the
headsman, with savage and triumphant frown; and there
fronted him the bodiless head, whose indistinct visage
grew fast into recognition,with hair clotted,pallid and
clayey cheeks, and lips knit in death's agonyhis very
flesh trembled at the torturing view; and then arose as
eager of inventive pain, dark and dismal terrors of
violence
,
of abuse and of poison, that might be committed in
the secrecy of those prison boundaries;not one of the
thousand ways which could be struck on by the most
desperate murtherer to rid him of a hated foe, but was
painted visibly to the mind of Arnyte; and he shuddered
in very fear at the dread shadows of his alarmed brain.
Thus cherishing and brooding over in secret and silence
his unhappiness, he roamed to the outskirts of the city;
no tender voice of consolation or assistance,not one
frank, kind question from the many known in better
days, whom he met ere he attained the Poort, was
advanced
at him; and yet it wanted but a whisper of
commiseration
,
for the heart, sick and tried with grief, in an
instant o'erflows like the eyes of infancy, in whose glassy
brilliance tears and smiles alternate reign, to have
unlocked
,
as from the sources of a fountain, every channel
of his pent up sorrowsit lacked but the benignant
countenance of pity, and the outstretched arm of
protection
to be extended, for the stripling to have grasped at
its support in very helplessness; still as it was, the trials
he had undergone in the past night, he appeared scarce
to be conscious to have suffered; he knew not, or seemed
not to know, as he walked onward, the overpowerings of
fatigue; but his hollow and vacant look, and pallid cheek
bespoke the faintness of his o'er laboured body;
however
,
he sought no food nor rest, but albeit as lacking
not these, with undetermined course he proceeded
beyond
the city pallisades; nathless ere he had gone this
distance, there had been those who had accosted him;
but these were few, and they had approached him with
cold words of comfort, that they decked their lips
withal, but which were far from their hearts. They
were of those who talk of patience, and give counsel to
misery, yet would not stretch their hands to pluck from
the water the drowning man, to whom they had so kindly
lent advice. Arnyte listened impatiently to their
guidance
;
their busy tones sounded in his ears like the
24*
fretting drone of a gnat; their words worried him to
madness, although that which they taught sank profitless in
his hearing as water in a sieve; for his was not a wo to
be relieved by the timely proverbs or philosophical
applications
ever ready in the mouths of such dotard dreamers,
who preach quiet to a wretched soul burdened with
adversity
,
as they would eat a meal from custom. In truth
the voices of these men and their measured kindness fell
like ice bolts on the soul of the sufferer, searing and
withering instead of healing, for they bared his wounds
to the very quick,they discovered how wide was his
wretchedness and desolation,they wrecked at one dark
swoop the youthful enthusiasm of his confiding nature.
The path which Arnyte had unwittingly taken led
direct from the old Water Poort,
[25]
[25]
The Gate, and the Block House appertaining, stood at the
intersection of the present Pearl and Wall streets.
or East-river gate, over
the suburb street, called the Green-lane, and passing the
Smee's Vly and Beekman's hill, continued to wind along
from the city, by a low, slimy shore, fringed with the
bare and leafless sprouts of the osier, whose winter
blackened
branches were hung with multitudinous icicles that
were rattled by the morning breeze, and glittered in the
light of the gay sun, who, from his gorgeous pavilion of
curtaining clouds, dispensed around upon the frosty earth,
the feathery thorn, and the proud spire, alike,
loveliness
and life. Here and there at the side of the way,
were interspersed amid the wild shrubs and stumps that
vein the soil or grow forth like excrescences of nature,
in salt and marshy land,the scarred trunks of a stunted
polled willow, while at intervals on some small and cleared
space of ground which bore traces of cultivation, rose
on the sight some hovel, half mud and half logs, with
paneless window and patched roof, the dwelling of a
fisher, (for the Dutch landsmen hugged the higher and
richer country,) whose inmate's occupation was
proclaimed
by the huge heaps of frozen oyster-shells about the
door, the threshold of which was thronged by sportive
and breechless urchins, regardless of the weather,
playing and tumbling about like young porpoises upon the
surface of the river, or echoing back the call and hail from
the lusty-throated negro, who plied the paddles of the
passing skiff, that shot in sight like an arrow on the green
waters, on its way to the city, loaded with market truck.
Now freed of the city, Arnyte seemed to have shook
off something that had clogged his pace, and his steps
were redoubled, as though the swifter he left behind him
the residence of humanity, the more that which distracted
him was absorbed; the very air relieved him, as he
thought; and now more and more the congregated hum
of man subsided, the less terrible was the conflict of his
mind in appearance; but it deceived;for still deep and
lasting was the fire that consumed him; he only stilled
his pangs of heart for the moment, as the Spartan boy
cloaked the stolen fox to tear his entrails forth; nathless,
he hurried on, as though he left behind a den of wolves,
from whose rapacious hunger nought was in safety. He
pursued the road, busied with grief, nor noted the kind
salute of the honest boer, as he drove by in his gay sled,
whose jingling bells rang out their merry peal, until he
was far out of sight; nor gave he return to the `
Mynheer
,
hoe is het met u dis morgen,'with which he was
addressed by the light-hearted labourer, who with axe
on shoulder, crossed the road towards the upland fields,
and who, surprised at the inattention of the youth to his
social greeting, stood awhile to gaze after his rapid steps,
deeming strange things, in his wonderment, of the
unfortunate
stripling, both from his wild looks, and the
disordered
pace wherewith he moved, regardless of obstacle
or hurt.
The road which young Leisler had pursued after
following
the irregular windings of the beach of the Oost Vloed,
for a considerable distance through a swampy and
unfruitful
country, the very pathway at times encroached on from
the water by creeks, and on the land by morasses, at
length opened on a small stream or rather rivulet, which
was called the fresh water river; and which deriving its
birth from a lagoon of fresh water, known by the name of
the De Kolck,
[26]
[26]
In later years called the Collect.
at flood times with no insignificant strength
connected the parent pool with the waves of the East
River, whose tide rising several feet higher than that of
its sister river the Nordt Vloed, caused a water
communication
across the island; for the fresh water pond on its
opposite side was joined to the lordly Hudson by a
streamlet
whose natural channel had been widened by a mill
run. The shores of the De Kolck were diversified with
wind mills and neat Dutch mansions; the first strong and
substantially built with stone, having the dates of their
erection in ornamental figures of iron on their fronts in the
same fashion in which they adorned the gable ends of the
houses in the city, while their huge fans extended at their
sides, seemed like the covering shield of some warlike
form;and the last raised on the very brink of the water,
and many times ran far out in the lagoon itself, which was
dyked around each dwelling after the manner of some of the
great mansions on the canals in the Vaderlandts, the taste
of whose superstructure and situation had struck the
architect's
fancy so potently, that as far as nature would
allow
,
he had copied it in building in the Nieuw Nederlandts;
so that the owner might step in his schouw from the very
door of his dwelling, or look from his bed-chamber
window
,
wrapped in his morning gown and covered with his
night cap, and as he smoked his merschaum, eye the
dipping
of his poultry in the clear waters of the stream, or
watch the sportive counsel of his thriving congregation
of geese and ducklings as they sailed delighted on the
smooth wave, which ran murmuring in echo to their
amorous parlance about the homesteads of the puissant
masters of their destinies.
At this time the De Kolck was frozen over, and its
mirrored surface presented to the sight a glass whereon
there seemed a reflection of the stilly heavens, unbroken
save where from 'neath the gelid sheet that enclosed the
water, there broke forth in a wild torrent of foam, over
some temporary dam or flood gate, the unbridled current
the dashing spray wantoning and leaping about as
rejoicing
at having burst its thraldom, looked in its wild
and headlong flow like the snowy flakes of froth flung
from the fiery nostrils of a gallant war steed, as he
champs the curb and paws the dust in his impatience
while the hollow and continued sound of the falling
cataract
,
chafing in angry mood the encroaching ice, like a
proud spirit contending with an invader, was like the
distant
and long repeated noise of a conflict of warring
armies
,
the echo of whose desperate struggles shakes the
burthened earth; and where the sleety covering of the
liquid element was illuminated by the rays of the morning,
its dazzling and unsullied surface of living chrystal
glowed
with tints of every hue that far out-vied the fantasies
of art; cerulean and roseate, sapphire and emerald,
mocking
the richest gems of the lapidary.Here and there
scattered
on the face of the imprisoned pond, where the ice
was thickest, could be seen the hardy skater, enwrapped
in his warm cloak and balanced by his poised stick,
disporting
and marking out curves and fantastic figures on
the polished and frozen visage of the lagoonnow
darting
along swift as a winged shaft shotten from a bow
now circling and cleaving with rapid heel, quick as the
following of sight itself, the congealed bosom of the
streamlet, anon shooting hither, then thitherward as a
thing borne by the wanton sweep of the invigorating
breeze, at a moment's will, taking one course, pursued
by his eager fellows, and again, like the swoop of the
lammer geyer, round an alpine peak to avoid their
playful
grasp, eluding the extended hand of his sanguine
companion, he wheels abrupt unto an adverse way,
leaving
his baulked pursuer, unwitting of his drift, to take
a wider circuit,all skimming away in their revelry, like
a flight of swallows, cutting the clouds in the merriment
of their summer lives. There too, within a stone's cast
of the beach, though often some venturesome little
varlet
,
was perceived making his way far out towards the
centre of the pool, braving, in his gambols, the
mournful
and warning voice of the groaning and creaking ice
on which he rambled, and on whose treacherous support
he relied, while at many times, in mere hardihood of
mischief he enlarged the air holes of the stream by
breaking away the surrounding snow, delighting in the
gladsome gurgling forth of the released waters, nor
dreamed in his rash sport of the danger he tempted,
frolicked troops of merry children, some of whom were
gliding on the breast of the frozen lagoon in mimicry of
the more fortunate skater, with small pieces of wood or
bone fitted to the bottom of their feet, avidious of their
slippery and precarious enjoymentsome, a mingled
band of male and female, black and white, throwing
themselves in various attitudes, grotesque and gamesome,
chased each other in sliding on places, which they, by
repeated and successive trips, had worn smooth as the
finest silk, and on which, it was scarce possible to stand
or walk, without risking a limb to the person who braved
their slipperiness, albeit, well accustomed to so perilous
a labour; some, who with their mates, had deserted the
sides of the slanting, Flattenbarrack, the lofty Golden,
and the noble Potbaker's hills, were engaged in racing
their miniature sledges, that were gayly ornamented
after the style of their originals, which paraded the
streets of New-Yorke to the music of their many
tinkling
bells; while these bore the name of some Dutch
hero, skipper, dorp or dogger, fancifully painted and
decorated on them, in accordance to the humour and
whim of the sportive and thoughtless owner, who urged
the course of his ingenious imitation, either astride or
laying on his breast, with legs outstretched, to guide the
route resembling a flying squirrel, except in pace; and
there were others, weary for the time, or the excluded,
albeit, envious of the partakers of the sports from which
they were discarded, that in herds and groups were
assembled
,
and gazed on the merry career of their
competitors
.
There was the tender school boy, wrapped
close from the chillness of the raw winter atmosphere
by his careful mother, with ears bandaged and 'kerchief
about his neck, guarding him from sickness, and with hand
warmly encased in his party coloured mittens, whose
clumsy fingers scarce served him to sustain the satchel
that contained the hated task, and which, while he loitered,
remembered him of his Dutch primer, and the surly
frown and uplifted rod of his querulous preceptor, so
apt to disregard the ready tears and faltering excuse.
There too, was the little idler, the young lawless
vagabond
,
whom the lash, the gentle word, nor scolding,
could control or confine to his duty, with tattered and
crownless hat, through the yawning gaps of which,
peeped his stray and blowsed locks, utterly regardless of
his ragged jacket, wantonly lacerated attire and shoeless
foot, he capered, tossed, tumbled and floundered about, like
an eel fresh drawn from its native element; and now, slily
and unseen, sending at his heedless companions, for the
sake of riot, hardened balls of snow, anon whooping and
shouting, shrieking and yelling from triumph, as his
favourite
wins in the game hefore him, though many times
for no reason, except for noise and wantonnesshis
hands, toes and face, unprotected and uncovered, and
died to the very redness of the ripened cherry, from
the sharp and piercing breeze as it stole along, gathering
chillness, from the pond itself, while the hardy urchin,
apparently delighted in defying its keenness, rather than
flinched from its pinching and hungered bite. In good sooth,
all on the wide spread De Kolck, from the clumsy
garbencumbered
Dutch lad, with his three cornered hat,
double
broeks, worsted stockings and plated knee buckles,
the merry eyed maiden with close cut coif, to the
grinning
and curly pated offspring of the kitchen negroes
who shared the play, was one throng of holiday
laughter
and jocund hilaritythe bright and mirthful glee of
youthof that spring-tide of life, when sorrow is ever
but as the last drops of a summer shower, through which
sunbeams are breakingwhen death and wo are heard
of as a fireside tale, that saddens for a moment the
sparkling countenance, but whose terrors are soon
forgotten
in the laugh of joy, and that unrepressed vivacity
less experienced of the instability of hope, which sees
nothing but happier days, and gayer garlands in futurity.
Arnyte paused not a moment on the sight of the happy
rout, for the pleasures of others do but tend to mock
the deserted creature of miserylike green fields and
sunny glades, for which he longs in vain as he gazes
through his prison bars, are to the eyes of the desolate
convictlike the voice of the healthful, in the ear of
the sick man, bringing with its sound but a bitter
comparison
of the wretchedness of his poisoned lot; even so
with a face jaundiced with an evil, as if when he had cause
for tears, it were unmeet it should be catered, otherwise
to any, doth he that is racked of heart, regard the
wreathed smile of the gay, or the mingled shout and
tread of revelry or merrimentfor misfortune makes
those at whom she darts her snakelike fangs, at once
selfish and envious, turning to the bitterest gall all
liberal
and inborn virtuefor its victim deems in the
madness
of his trials, that on him alone the curse of Ishmael
hath fallen, that all men's hands are against him, and he
feels as if against all men he could gladly turn the besom
of destruction. Hastily, therefore, did young Leisler
pass over the little bridge of logs that crossed the outlet
or rather arm of the De Kolck, and rushed forward on
the path, which, on the farther side of the rivulet,
ascended
with a winding course, a somewhat rising tract
of country, overlooking in its tortuous sweep, the
fresh water pond and all its busy crowd, the sound of
whose diversions, uprose to the higher ground as from
the bosom of a valley. Having kept an uneven route
for a short time, and risen insensibly to a considerable
height above the water, which, caught in glimpses through
clumps of hanging fir trees, gloomy rocks, snow and
embedded
ice, looked like a silver mirror, the road
suddenly
branched off in two separate ways, the one
proceeding
and extending in the neighbourhood of the Oost vloed
towards the Nechtant or Coerlar's Hoek, and the other
running far up in the open country, pursued its course
past the landhuisen of the Bayards, the Rombouts, the
Minthornes, and the Stuyvesants, until it reached
Bestavers
Killitjie, and the Spijt den duyvel Kill. The
progress of Arnyte had been somewhat in unison
with the disorder of his mindat times his pace
was slow, hesitating and thoughtful, with brows bent as
perusing the earth on which they were unconsciously
fixed
,
and so silent and noiseless was his step that he
startled
not, until close upon him, the watchful snow-bird that
sat chirping upon the lowermost branches of the naked
trees that skirted the way-side, and who when frightened
skimmed with his dark wing the frozen surface of the
snowy ground as he sought a safer perch; and then anon
as if by speed he could disperse from his disquieted mind
the horrors of the gloomy clouds that thronged upon him,
he hurried along with rapid, unmindful, and violent
strides and look disturbed and unsettled as one who flies
from the hot pursuit of an armed and deadly foe. It was
in one of these last described paroxysms of grief that he
approached
the division of the road, and before he was well
aware of his presence, he came nigh rushing on a person
who had stationed himself at the very fork of the path;
he had but a chance to check his headlong career within
a pace of the stranger, by whom he was unperceived,
and who thus abruptly thrown on the observance of the
youth was one who from the singularity of his position
and appearance, had the power to draw his attention for
the time, having his eye once fixed upon this object,
relieving
his more dismal meditations with surprise and
conjecture
;
for it scarce needed a repetition of his glance for
young Leisler to recognize with wonderment, in spite
of the unlucky disposition of his garments through rags,
filth and tatters the still burley visage and portly form
of Ensign Jost Stoll, whom the fears of the youth had
of a certainty long since given up as a mournful feast to
the grave worm or the mountain eaglet; and in sooth
reader it was our old acquaintance hearty, but somewhat
worn by suffering, yet safe and graphical as ever, in
defiance
of the almost unheard of straits, travail, turmoil,
and danger he had undergone since the narrative left him
in consequence of his own obduracy, at the mercy of
the pirate's steel, in the ruined wigwama forlorn and
selfentangled sacrifice for the blood-thirsty buccaneer to
satiate his cruel spleen upon for the escape of his
intended
victim; and indeed it had fared severely with the
rash amateur, his life had been spared it was true, but
that was nearly all that he had escaped with, being stript
by the plunderer of every article of value, even to his
bare fleshat the first burst of rage from the pirate at his
being baffled as to Sloughter, the ensign's existence hung
but on a word, and it was but the change of a whimthe
humour of the moment that prevented the luckless wight's
having his heart rent from its casket, an immolation to
Vol. II. 25
the savage fury of the intemperate Kidbut it seemed the
rover being disappointed in the principal object of his
expedition, the capture of Sloughter and the rifling of
the despatches and papers of which the Colonel was the
bearer, and the contents of which as injurious, by
authorizing
effective proceedings against his illicit courses,
to the prosperity of the free trade of the buccaneer, by
some secret advices which (an the rumour of the day is
to have credence) came from no mean source, had been
made known to the desperate marauder, he apparently
disdained to wreak his anger or revenge on the mere
secondary personage who was left in his hands;the first
passion having somewhat subsided in the heat of
immediate
pursuit made unsuccessfully after the fugitive
captives
,
and day fast dawning at the return of those who
had followed the trail, and disliking the incumbrance of
the Ensign in the march, on dispersing his confederates
and Kid's making for his boats which were moored in
concealment
and ambush in the nearest inlet to the place
where the scene of the past night had been transacted,
he gave directions to his followers to enlarge the luckless
prisoner, which however was not done until they had
disrobed him completely of every garment to which they
took a fancy, bestowing on him nevertheless in return the
most tattered, worthless, and ragged portions of their own
wardrobes, in spite of every entreaty for moderation made
to their ruthless compassionand as it were out of mere
malice and wilful fancy, not content with heaping the
most outrageous indignities on the helpless bondsman,
they with most atrocious cruelty beat and pricked him
with their naked cutlasses until his very back ran seams
of welled gore, all the while mocking, with hideous
and brutal laughter, the acuteness of his sufferings;
and even terrible as were the torments thus inflicted,
the ensign was fortunate that their commander
grudged
them time, ere the fierce adventurers could put
in force worse torturesfor there were some among
the band who meditated his murder, for the purpose of
giving, according to their rude and maritime superstition,
charge to his spirit, who, they supposed, would keep
the trust, such wealth and treasure as they had amassed
in their unlawful voyages, and buried or concealed about
the rocks and in the earth around this spot of their
harbourage
;
for such was the wild idea, that while the
riches were in keeping of the dead, no mortal hand, save
their own, could ever touch them; and under this
impression
,
many are the golden ingots and wedges,crosses
of diamonds torn from the hand of the trembling devotee,
moidores, ducats, and pieces of eight, the spoil of the
conquered flota and galleons of Spain, and the haughty
Portuguese, which lay rusting to this day, in the sod of
the Manahadoes, unclaimed and unknownthe hands
which deposited them, being colder, and as powerless
as the metals themselvesthe stern acquirers
having
perished on the wave, or in the blood-stained
breach of some stormed town, leaving none in the secret
of the gain they left from their dangerous toils, their
murders or their battles, save the eternal heavens, whose
cold and silent moon, gilds, with its light at full, the
hidden
spot, but whose direction, living eye can read not
and the melancholy forest, whose mournful whisper
prates not to human ear of the place of their
concealment
.
And when indeed at last, the unfeeling tormentors
quitted the sinking object of their brutal sport, yielding
not to a weariness of cruelty, but reluctantly, to the
frequent
and impatient calls of their fierce leader, who,
having, as is before shown, dispatched Eumet to carry
the eventful tidings of Sloughter's arrival to Leisler,
and his interested protectors of the faction, embarked
on board his light armed shallop, and spread his broad
sails from the shore; they left the abused soldier nearly
fainting, and almost insensible from excruciating pain,
in a wood path, where they had driven or rather dragged
him, from the neighbourhood of their den, cautious lest
he should know the tract that might discover the
wigwam
.
Overpowered with weakness, his dull ear awoke
to no sound in that which seemed his last mortal agony,
save the sudden and sharp howl of the hungry and
voracious
wolf, as he approached from the neighbouring
brake, and caught the scent of an expected banquet;
the miserable sufferer might have perished on the spot
where he had been cast by the ruthless buccaneer,
unable
from weakness, or unwilling from despair, to exert
his remaining powers to a single effort to preserve life,
but for the fortunate approach of a hunter. By the
hardy and compassionate son of the chace, he was
assisted
to an adjacent log hut, from whose poor but
hospitable
inmates, his wounded limbs and bruised body,
received
every tendance and care, their limited resources
could supply; they fed his parched lips with the
renovating
balsam of the fever tree, and the juice of the
aromatic
anise; they stanched the gory flowings on his
lacerated
flesh, with the life-preserving essence of many
a wild Indian herb, unknown to the votaries of science;
the heart-shaped leaves of the deer's tongue, the
sassafras
and the star weed, lent their genial powers; and the
rude art of his kind hosts, with needful rest, restored
him far sooner to health, strength and spirits, than could
the false trickeries of the medicinerso that, having
been set on his way, by his benevolent entertainers, Jost
Stoll had proceeded the distance on the road, when
Arnyte
recognised him, to rejoin his late comate and fellow
traveller, the now governor of the colony of
New-Yorke
.
But however, in the pursuance of this last
intention
,
the ensign's journey was by no means one of
great expeditionfor his route was through the wild
and picturesque land, scarce trodden, and perchance
heretofore unnotedbut on which no eye of
painter
,
or of the lover of untutored nature, could gaze
unmoved
,
or pass by without admirationfor as he wended
onwards, now beside the road, there swelled like
heavings
of the mountainous billow, high and majestic hills;
less, had been the theme of fame in other lands, but
nameless they stood within the desert and the solitude,
clad in their shroud of winter; the stern gigantic
battlements
of nature, along whose icy walls, like armed
warriors
,
towered skyward mighty and gnarled trees, whose
limbs, brown, bare and without foliage, were stretched
out as defying the tempest to hurl them from their
rooted
seatsand now, first on the ear like the hollow
rumbling
of an earthquake, and anon, burst on the sight of
the enraptured pedestrian, the roar of the precipice of
waters, as like the timorous hart flying from the pursuing
hound, delirious with affright, the bright wave in flashing
masses of foam and flood, leaped wildly from rock to
rock, while each rude cleft that received the bounding
fall glittered with crystal incrustations and fantastic
masses
of ice, the snow white spray freezing as it sprung and
scattered on the dark surface of the granite, like jewels
round the neck of an thiop; and then as he emerged
from these primeval ramparts of crag and highland, there
would come on the view, the deep and silent glade, the
sloping dells, and the dark forest gorges and defiles, all
lovely and fair to see, even with the fleecy covering of
the seasonbeautiful in their dreariness, like the young
and innocent in death, upon whose blanched lips sets the
fixed and peaceful smile the spirit left at parting;and
yet withal, the white and ghastly desolation, told not of
the rich and holiday aspect, worn by those wild and
solitary
vales, rugged crags, and desert glens, in their hour
of summer glory, few of whose relics remained, and
these hung like withered trophies in the winter's
dreariness
;
no more the ground glowed in its carpet of deep
green sward, from whose rich sod leaped up the wildling
green and budding woodland flower, fresh in its
childhood
,
making redolent with its aromatic breath the
odorous breeze with living fragrance; no more the
juniper
,
the ivy vine, and the rhodendrum, clung to the
fissures and crevices of the rocks, swathing their iron
breasts as with a mantle; the copsewood was no longer
garlanded with dewy foliage, nor did the luxuriant trees
flaunt their spiry heads as wont, like gay banners o'er a
festal rout; the busy winglet of the humming bird was
hushed, and the stock dove's gentle murmurings, filled
not the air with music longerbut all the scene was
naked
desolate,
as if a blast had come upon the beauty
and the pride of that fair wilderness, and stricken its
splendours with the pallidness and coldness of the silent
tomb. As the doughty ensign passed through this
romantic
country, he found that neither the danger that it
25*
had exposed him to, nor the sufferings which he had
endured
mainly for its sake, had expelled his ancient
passion
and habit, but it came on him as with redoubled
force, and frequent were its irresistible promptings and
attacks, that induced him to linger on the dale, and pause
enraptured, on the peak of mount and hill as he soberly
trudged forward, that at leisure, his eager eye might
drink in the boundless prospect, and all the liberal
profuseness
of creation, whose blooming and brightest
wealth, thus as it were unknown, unculled, and nearly
unseen by human eye, bespoke how little was the world
made for the vain creature of humanity, who hath the
audacity to claim it as his ownman fond man, a god in
presumption, and yet a mote, an atom, in reality
worthless
as the dust, that is played on by the wind.
Oftentimes
,
as he went along, the ready hand of our
connoiseur
,
transferred, with pliant power, the scenes which
enrapt his vision, in a skeleton form, to the surface of a
crumpled and dirty bit of vellum, which, with the tender
and assiduous care a mother strives to shield from harm
and hurt her sickly infant, Jost Stoll had made out to
preserve, amid the severest trials of his late
adversities
,
and whose motley visage presented a
heterogeneous
mass of objects, mingled and confused, from the
innumerable
subjects gathered by the avidious amateur, at
nearly every step. In the last instance, sometime before
young Leisler had advanced on his road, the ensign had,
for a better view, elevated himself on the very topmost
bar of a rough hewn fence of pine or cedar logs, which
kinds of wood, splitten on the spot where often they had
been felled and placed transversely, for the most part
formed the rude enclosures of the settler's cultivated
land, which did not, many times, exceed an half acre,
a patch chosen where the soil was richest and most free
from impediments of sterility; the earnest soldier sat
poised snug and secure, as apparently, on his narrow and
uncomfortable seat, with legs crossed, patiently, in
support
of the object of his labour, and so avidious of the
satisfaction he mentally enjoyed, as scarce to perceive
the least inconvenience of a minor nature, when
compared
to his pleasure. On his head, he had an aged hat,
slouched on one side, so as at once to give a knowing
and burlesque air to the countenance it enshadowed,
being
,
nevertheless, of itself, somewhat as rare a curiosity
as its wearerfor it showed, with rueful aspect, the sad
effect of time and long and faithful service, having
neither
shape, manner, nor fashion, and being withal a
most woful spectacle of decrepitude, so perforated with
holes and cruel rents, as to resemble a keg riddled with
pistol balls: the plunderers had left him no weapon of
any sort, and his goodly rapier was absent from his
sturdy
thigha shrunk and tattered mantle, and that which
may be termed an apology for a pair of galligaskins, so
tattered, torn and stained, that it would have puzzled the
shrewdest antiquarian, to have decided on its original
texture and formfinished his complement of garment,
or more properly speaking, his hangings; so strange and
wretched an appearance, did the once gay soldier present
from the robber's hand, that albeit, looking so very an
emblem of distress as he did, had he offered to stroll
the streets of Nieuw Amsterdam at noon day, he would
not alone risked the fretfulness of each snappish hound,
who, fattened at his master's feet, for very spleen, barks
at poverty, sickening at the sight, like the purse proud,
and the upstartbut he certainly would have run a fair
chance of an intimate acquaintance, by means of the
friendly
intercession of Mass Garrit Abeel, the little waddling
Dutch overseer of the poor, with the stadt werkhuis, which
was the miniature counterpart of the famous one on the
Westperveld in the Low Countries, and was always kept
by a sufficient person, the office sometimes with others
being adjoined, that is, when there was no beggarly
alderman
to hunger for the salary, as a kind of sinecure
to the mayoraltyhis honour, the Schout, being also
commissioned coroner and clerk of the market. So
entirely
was Jost Stoll engrossed in his occupation, the
matter of which might have been readily surmised
from his posture and glances, which last were now
quickly thrown towards the distant de Kolck and all its
mingled assemblage, and then with intense intention,
reverted to that which he had delineated, so he neither
seemed to hear nor see, or to be stirred by motion
or sound, within his immediate neighbourhood, while at
times, a smirk of inward gratification would move the
muscles of his face, as he triumphed in the success of
that on which he was employed; and ever and anon, with
strange grimace of peculiar admiration, he would twist
his head in one direction at first, and then in another, as
the sketch at which he so greedily worked, pleased his
steadfast taste and imagination. The ensign saw not the
startled look of the stripling, nor heard his first
ejaculation
of surprise.
How?whatam I to believe my sight deceives
not? exclaimed Arnyte after a short silence, wherein
he strove to recover his amazement at the unlooked for
rencounter, art thou unharmed, safe from the savage
anger of the roversafesafe from the bloody knife of
murthercan such things happen? The ways of heaven
are indeed provident and merciful; seeing this, why
should I despairis there no hope also for me?
At this address of mixed astonishment and soliloquy,
the Ensign, with a peevish start of body, elevated his
brows, drew up the corners of his mouth in wrinkles, and
twisted in very pettishness the muscles of his visage,
giving
at the same time a burlesque cast of ruefulness and
dolour
to his whole countenance, like one who hath unawares
swallowed an unpleasant medicinal potion; but,
nevertheless
,
his face underwent this change of aspect from its
former placidity without his raising in the least his sight
from that which he was tracing (for to that his eyes were
held as enraptured) towards the person who accosted
him, nor did he in any wise alter either posture or
attitude
,
nor stirred he a limb, save an impatient drumming
of one of his feet against the log on which it rested, so
as to discontinue his genial task; but he the rather
appeared
to ply thereat with increased and renewed
determination
,
and sooth he worked away with all the
freshness
of effort wherewith an high spirited and indignant
stripling, having escaped from the restraining hands of
pacifying arbitrators, flies at his taunting adversary who
hath seemingly challenged a renewal of battle while his
opponent was withheld from the combat.
Now by mine halidome! this is provokingthe road
ha? you've eyesfollow your nose; its long enough to
guide youan't it damnable! detestable! forsooth, I meant,
my dear fellow! growled Jost Stoll, busily employed
while speaking, which was with the hasty manner of one
whose pleasure is abruptly and unceremoniously broken
upon by the hated voice of scholastic advice, or as though
an ill natured gnat had wound his buzzing pipe about his
ear and nose, in defiance of his fretful endeavour to drive
away the humming insect, and evidently mistaking
Arnyte
for some troublesome passenger on the way, who
had made inquiry at him of the path, Now by mine
troth! this would perplex a saintmy master, an you'd
use sight, you need not vex your neighbours thus: thy
unwise hurry hath drove me wrong in this outline; he
went on, faith, master, time's a beggar, and would
wrong one of a sketch that might honour Frans Mieris
or old Breugel. Hum! ha! Gad, I have it! I have
it! continued he, suddenly changing his tone to
exultation
,
by the hand of Carlo Maratti, that touch hath
given it new spiritthere's life! there's soul! it is
nature's
self! Sir Godfrey would die of envy, did he see
this winter landscape o' minethe putting on of that last
shade is inimitable! it improves the whole aspect from
its former state, making it like the master piece of De
Rhyn when compared to the insipid works of a Crayer,
Schut or Van Balen. And having thus spoken aloud the
overflowings of his heart with unrestrained delight, the
Ensign pursued his occupation, apparently relapsed into
his former heedlessness of all around, and solely attentive
to that at which both heart and mind were at once
enchained
in pleasant slavery; and indeed it was not until
after several repeated attempts, that young Leisler
succeeded
in arousing the soldier from his infatuation, and
attracted his dormant curiosity, and then it was not until
he had explained his altered dress and appearance, and
by a relation of circumstances stamped his truth, that
the stripling was recognized as his fellow in the wigwam
by the marvelling Jost Stoll, who could scarce, in his joy
at the meeting, reconcile the chance that had so strangely
brought them again togetheragain and again he told the
tale of his sufferings, feeling as if in the repetition of each
incident he found a satisfaction; and in truth there is an
indescribable pleasure in telling those dangers we have
braved to such as we believe sympathize and rejoice with
us, that nearly repays for all that in the endurance hath
been borne, and this was felt by the honest ensign in the
highest degree, that for awhile he had nearly forgot his
sketch, though that was not long, for scarce had the
paroxysm past of his joy, ere he thrust on the
examination
of the youth, and teased him with the explanation of
his labours; but the ensign, selfish as he was in this
particular
,
could not be blind to the obvious inattention of
his auditor to that which he exhibited, and though at
the first, he was somewhat irritated and offended, yet, on
remarking severely at Arnyte's neglect, as he looked in
the youth's face, he was struck with the settled sorrow
and despair that in his speaking visage was fearfully
depicted
.
The warm hearted amateur thrust his vellum in
his bosom, pocketed his pencil, and having gazed for a
minute in silence in his face, he questioned the stripling
in a voice soothing and inviting confidence, and with a
manner replete with persuasive kindness on the cause
of his apparent sorrow.
For God's sake, my young master, what aileth thee?
quoth the ensign;thou lookest more like the picture
of a corse, than one whose only tint should be the bloom
of healthwhy, man, your countenance hath the
bloodless
,
heart-appalling hue which Rembrandt hath spread
over his painting of Belshazzer's vision of the
hand-writing
on the wallnay, cheer thee, my brave cavalier;
it is a friend that bids thee have comfort; give me thy
hand, youngster, and unbosom thy load of grief; mayhap
Jost Stoll may find a means to lighten that which now
seemeth to burthen thee so heavily.
It had been a long time since one frank question, thus
dictated by the voice of friendship, had broke with a
consolatory effort on the bereaved and benumbed heart
of Arnyte; it was not the words, nor the manner which
Jost Stoll warmly grasped his hand, that unlocked, as
from a pent up stream, all the withered feelings of his
soul: but young Leisler saw, or deemed be read
sincerity
in his companion's every look, and the thought,
that he had once risked his life for his rescue, though
unavailing, confirmed, as it were, faith in his sympathy;
for it is hard to believe that such as have been with us in
the hour of need and peril, and have shared its stress,
should be cold to us in our solitary woes; and the poor
soldier is struck deepest by denial, when he seeks alms
of a brother warrior.
As he rehearsed the doleful incidents of the ruin of his
family to his companion, the eyes of the stripling overran,
and tears as fast, as free, as rain drops from summer
clouds, fell on his cheeks; and the voice of his story
was tremulous, inarticulate and broken, although he
vainly strove for manly resolution; that firmness with
which he had fronted the court was fled in the presence
of one, before whom he deemed there was no need for
exercise of pride; albeit, the energy wherewith he had
borne himself was but as a cloak around a wounded
body, concealing for a time the terror of the heart, but
which at last is made known, by the bursting forth of
flooding gore.
Now, by mine halidome! cried the ensign, scarce
waiting to hear in patience the conclusion of the youth's
recital of misfortune, while as he spoke, his features
beamed with a glad smile of solace and resolution;
why, my master, art thou so wrapt,so lost in the
depths of misery as to see no hope to catch at? art blind,
man, to mourn thus over irretrievable sorrow, when relief
is within a pallet's length of thy grasp;why, thy case is
but like a gem of antiquity,a rare painting, that from
age and ill usage, hath all its beauties obscured in darkness
and dirt; sooth, man, it only lacks the cunning hand of
the artist, and careful tendance, to bring forth in
freshness
as when first laid on, the tints and colouring; for
you must know, that these in the old masters fly not like
in the works of our unskilful modernsay, the ancients
understood the artwhy, what think ye?I have seen
ensamples of Guido and Titian, and that wonderful
colourist
,
Tintoretto, that seemed as if but painted
yesterday
,
while there are Du Jardyn's heads that scarce last a
year but the white turns yellowthere's no keeping them;
age improves the old masters, but destroys the daubers
of our day;but sooth, as the facts are, Mynheer
Leisler
,
it is well you have met me; for, perchance, you
might have fallen in the hands of some botching
pretender
,
who would have advised you as vilely as he would
mend a picturegad! he'd laid on the varnish till the
canvass cracked in rags, and touched and tampered with
the lights and shadows, till all the sweetness of the
original was merged in his own filthy paint and clumsiness.
Why, thou hast been blind as an ignorant critic,
examining a fine and finished group, who sees all faults
where there is nought but beauty; troth, man, why art
thou not at Sloughter's elbow? does he not owe thee a
life? and think ye he can have the heart to take thy
father's, or to stand calmly by, while the source of the
blood which was risked for his preservation is poured
out like mountain wine, to quench the thirst of any living
being?no! with all his faults, Hal Sloughter can never
be capable of such ingratitude; he is, it is true, a sad
fellow
,
but could he do that,after he hath seen thee, an he
suffers thy father's death,by my halidome! I'llI'll
damn it, I'll paint a picture like Michael Angelo, and put
him among the damned;come, we'll to his presence.
I've learned the Colonel hath his quarters at Mynheer
Bayard's, for the present, until the fort is fitted for his
reception. I've been seeking the place; they tell me it
is hereabout; so, let us on,we have no time to spare
to the machinations of your father's enemiesthough,
humha,I should like to finish my sketch; it will
scarce take a minute,yet a minute may to your father's
fate now he hours.I'll leave the thing; and if thereby
for ever I lose the opportunity of its perfect finish, it shall
remain like Buanarotti's famous head, drawn on the wall
with charcoal, in the idless of the moment,a
monument
,
if not of power, at least of what Jost Stoll hath
sacrificed to the cause of humanity, so Mynheer Arnyte
Leislerlet us onward to the Bayard mansion.
Having thus said, the Ensign seized the youth by the
arm and hurried him with rapid steps forward on the
road, and indeed what with the assured manner of his
companion, together with the words of Sloughter when
they separated after the escape from the blood-hounds of
the pursuing pirate, and which now with renewed strength
returned to his remembrance; there sprang forth in the
heretofore desolate breast of the stripling a confidence of
hope that before had not visited him in the darkness of
his miseries, and that claim which he had of a return of
benefit from the Governor grew in his thoughts of more
magnitude than he had ever supposed ithe had been
the saviour of the Colonel's life, thankseternal thanks,
had been vowed for the deed, and certainly his excellency
had been committed in honor, and by all that should be
held sacred between man and man;yet at this last thought
the fearful Arnyte shuddered, for he had seen and learnt
of late how little, how weak, and easy to be rent and
trampled on were those holy bonds, and he well knew
how wide was the difference of granting and of asking a
return of favour and of gratitude; that too often the basis
of the request is forgotten and lost in a calculation of
personal
interest, and the policy of that which is besought
stands for itself without a redeeming and collateral
circumstance
to prompt a favourable assentbut the enthusiasm
and sanguine wishes of youth conquered all latent doubts,
and Arnyte rejected indignantly every harsh idea that
submitted itself against the good feelings of Governor
Sloughter.
Yes, kind friend, thou advisest rightthank thee!
thank thee! exclaimed the stripling rapidly, as mentally
he chided the laggard brain whose promptings had not
sooner presented the course to his imagination, and
entering
into the intention of his companion he warmly pressed
the hand that held him in encouragement and support:
yes, I'll to the presence of Sloughterhe cannot have
the feelings of humanity an he list not my supplication
my tears shall wring his heartmy lamentations shall
Vol. II. 26
pierce him through were he marbleay, I will see him
though the accursed Bayard fence him from me with a
wall of ironyesyesdear father, I have yet a chance
to preserve thee remaininggreat God! how late the
thoughtby one wordone precious thought, dull brain
hadst thou not been as dead, ere this how much misery
what fruitless length of sorrow had been spared to me
and mine;and as with increased speed he urged his
associate on with the quick reflection of the moment, all
the self delusion of his young nature gathered power and
burst forth, accompanied with those hopes which had for a
time laid dormant, checked by the untimely frost of despair
the blasted tree of life seemed renewed within him, and
once again blossomed bright and exuberant, as it were
nourished by the warm and secret fountain whose
well-spring
lay hidden in the recesses of his heart, like a
flower
that from the night and storm had but shrunk inward,
and as awakened from a honied sleep it opens its bosom
to the dew, and spreads around the perfumed fragrance
its closed leaves had held as it rejoices in the reviving
embrace of the sunbeam which it smiles to meet;and yet
nevertheless amid this glimpse of light, a distant cloud at
times appeared at whose darkness when it crossed him a
sensation of rage and terror stole involuntarily through
him as though he gazed on the white crown of the
basilisk
,
the breath of whose vapour is pregnant with death,
and at the black idea, it took a moment's resolution to
regain his self possession; he had endured the very
extremity
of anguish as his evil fortune, he had truly breasted
wretchedness and despair, he had drank of a draught as
bitter as the juice of the chamfered aloe leafthe fearful
tenor of his fate could not be augmented in sorrow, it had
been but for him to smile at fresh malice from ungenerous
fortune, and he deemed he had been wound to that pitch of
frenzied bravery that the evil fate might heap on him, if it
destroyed, was welcome, and he would meet it withal as
the worn out and starved wretch who clings to the
scatterling
of the wreck, as he awaits death greets the gathering of
the travado whose coming wings are to whelm him in
destruction
but
this it seemed he scarce could bend his spirit
to perform, to pursue to its perfection the plan he had now
adopted of seeing Sloughter, he must perforce, in lowly
guise, a suppliant and humble beggar at the knee of
power, cross the threshold of the proud residence of the
inveterate Bayard, the foeman of his house. The idea
made his high heart swell within him, while every limb
trembled with agitation, at the very mention of the man
whose dark complottings had been so fatal to the name
of Leisler; and this, when breathed from the lips of
others, though ever present in his own breast, herded up
with a deep and seated trust for retribution, made his
eye flash, and flushed his cheek to fever; in truth, strong
was his reluctance to place a foot towards the dwelling,
that owned as master the deadliest enemy of his father's
life, even to seek its preservation. It was hard to see
the triumphant splendours of him whose untiring hate
had brought his unfortunate parent to the degradation,
and the chains he now bore and suffered, and to whose
never to be sated malice, most possibly, his blood was to
be shed as an oblation. Indeed Arnyte could not at
times, in this train of thought, disguise from himself that
it were not unlikely that should chance usher him in
the presence of that man, that, did not fortune prevail
as wont in Bayard's favour, and his arm was not
unwithered
,
though he fell for the deed, that the years of
Bayard
would not save him from his fury; and it was
with difficulty, and the remembrance of the
consequence
that might ensue to his father from so wild an
attempt, that he could quell his rebel feelings, which at
some moments wanted but the sight of his enemy to
have arisen to very madness. The needthe safety of
his father, prevailedand he determined at length to
forbear all, and creep, for his sake, were it demanded,
to the dust that Bayard shook from his feet, so it led to
Sloughter's presenceso it assisted in preserving from
the axe, the venerated head of Jacobus Leisler.
A few minutes brisk walking, brought the ensign and
Arnyte to a noble and lordly avenue, on each side of
which rose a row of the lofty acacias, and here and
there in the line towered a mighty poplar, which, straight,
bare and limbless, was like the tall mast of some gallant
vessel. Having entered the avenue, and followed the
course it led for a considerable distance, the country rising
higher from the river, whose sight they had sometime
left behind, as they went along, passing small forests of
huge pine trees and hemlocks, through which the path
was carefully cut, and ever and anon, some wide field,
which bore the trace of clearance and culture, and
which in the summer, perhaps, glowed with rich
burdens
of rye or wheat, they came at length to a neat
gateway, that opening on a large space of ground, in
which here and there was scattered an ancient
sycamore
,
that fronted the homestead of Nicholas Bayarda
large, and somewhat imposing mansion, in which the
Dutch and English architecture and material was not
unadvantageously blended. The building was one of that
class of mansions, introduced early after the conquest of
the English on the island of Manahadoes, as the country
residences of the wealthy. Here and there, still remains
in the vicinity of the city, a solitary remnant of these
dwellings, with its wide porticoes, and massy balustrades
and huge halls, though their stable and century enduring
foundations are fast rooting up, to make way for the
more flimsy, yet fashionable villas of the upstart and
fantastic crowd, who disdain the homes of the gentry of
the olden day, which look as men who have outlived
their timewhose comates are withering in the grave,
while they endure, lonely and neglected, and worn with
age, and move among the throng of the young and the
gay, that have, as in an hour, sprung up around them,
filling the places of departed friends, with cold and
scornful looks, like melancholy spectres of departed time.
A soldier of the adelborst, with arms folded, supporting
his musquetoon, paced slowly backwards and forwards
in front of the house, announcing by his guard of honour,
that the mansion was the temporary residence of the
governor
and commander in chief of the province of
New-Yorke
.
As the ensign and Arnyte approached the
dwelling, the soldier halted in his march, and fronted
their advanceand having drawn his pipe from his
mouth, with the luxury of which he appeared to be
wiling away the hour of duty, he for a moment stared
at them as they neared his post, with a suspicious
survey
,
ere, in a stern voice, he demanded their business,
and whom they wanted. To his questions, Jost Stoll
eagerly, and somewhat authoritatively, answered, that he
wished to see his excellency the governorat the
hearing
of which, instead of making way for him to pass, as
the ensign expected, the soldier, with an insulting and
insolent air and expression, laughing in mockery at his
ragged attire, bade him keep off and depart with his
companion
stating
that colonel Sloughter was not free to be
seen by such vagabondsand threatened, if they did
not instantly retire, that he should fire his gun upon
themwhich, with bold audacity, he levelled, to put
such purpose in execution. It was in vain they
endeavoured
to argue and prevail on the determination of the
manhe was still obduratehe laughed at their anger,
and scorned their promises and persuasions, and, but for
the lucky and unexpected interference of an auxiliary, they
would have been forced to commit violence, to have
passed
the fellow, or have given over as fruitless the attempt.
The person who came to their assistance, was a brisk
looking little old woman, who advanced from the door of
the mansion, apparently attracted by the noise and
voices of the contending parties. The clamorous
outrage
of the soldier was in an instant stilled at the
presence
of this personage, as before a superior, while his
opponents ceased their struggles in the curiosity of the
moment, somewhat stricken with the singularity of the
figure that was ushered before themwhose undulatory
and multitudinous form, in breadth, size and shape, might
have been compared with some truth to a Dutch
fishing
doggerfor though wanting in height, the dame lacked
nothing in breadth, being as squab as a barreland to
her vast expansion of body, her dress made a
considerable
additionfor her hips protruded plainly from the
compass of her voluminous attire, their swelling shape
increased by monstrous quiltings and gatherings of dress,
which were puckered up in numerous folds at her side,
26*
A snow white mob cap, stiff and starched, with streaming
ribands and pointed lace, covered her headher ears
were decorated with old fashioned golden ear-rings,
which depended down to her broad shoulders, and round
her neck she had a double string of beads, of yellow
amber, each one as large as a ripe cherry; about her
waist and shoulders, though low in the neck, she had a
kind of jacket of black velvet, worked with many
coloured
silks, in flowers, and decorated with rows of
multitudinous
little silver buttons, fastening in front with a huge
stomacher, and lacings above it, with bars and crossings of
gilt fillagree, and edgings of Flemish lace; her gown, or
rather petticoat, was of a stout woollen stuff, coloured
with alternate lines of red and blue, and short enough to
exhibit to advantage her warm knit, yarn stockings,
with their enormous yellow clocks; and her substantial
feet were comfortably encased in a strong pair of shoes
of lackered leather, with polished buckles. Every thing
about the dame's attire and appearance, was neat, tidy
and notable, and well comported with the dignity of her
station as housekeeper to colonel Nicholas Bayard;
and indeed of the authority derived from such situation,
she was not a little proud, nor was she one who was
accustomed to leniency in the exercise of such sway as
she attained therefrom. Noin sober truth, frau
Hyletje was one of that sort who wait not with
deference
to the opinion of others, to set a true value on
themselves; and the good dame, though a short woman,
in earnest, was accustomed to hold her head mighty
high; nathless, vulgar sneers,but these she set down as
from the source they came, the jealousy of the canaille,
or `konolye,' as she termed them, with ineffable scorn.
Why, mensch Peterkin, said the dame to the soldier,
what in the name of wonder, is this clatter? who
and what are these, mensch Peterkin? pursued the
frauw directing a sharp scrutiny towards the ensign and
Arnyte, and somewhat disappointed by the unfavourable
plight of the graphist's garments, we can't have any
konolye
about the house, mensch Peterkin.
I have forbid them the grounds, frau Hyletje,
returned the alderbost respectfully, but they care not
for civil words, and I am driven to force to learn them
manners.
Ay, mensch Peterkin, the konolye never know their
distance, quoth the dame in return, yet, mensch
Peterkin
,
it is not respectful before our doors, when his
honour
and excellency dignifies the house with his
presence
and visit,it is not respectful, I say, as the tailor
said to his needle, when it pricked his thumb instead of
the cloth, that the entrance of a domicile of a
respectable
burgher, should be disgraced by the clamour of
konolyeyet what can be expected from such persons,
as the goose said to the gander, when the ducks eat up
all the corn. I say, mensch Peterkin, this does not
become
a decent and reputable family like ours, mensch
Peterkin!And yet, said the dame, somewhat mollified
in her precise and lofty notions, by the attractive
appearance
of young Leisler, the look of the younker is
not altogether so coarse, as the miller said to the grain,
when the wheel cracked and refused to grind. What's
your name and wish, Mienheer?an't your name
Schermerhorne? I never saw such a likeness as there is
about your eyes, to the Schermerhorne family at
Schenectadie
;
the colour of your hair is just theirs, as the cat
said to the kitten, when she told her of the rat. In the
name of wonder, you must be Douw Schermerhornethat
is, little Douwhe is the youngest of all the
Schermerhornes
.
Why child, how you've grown, as the crab said
to the mushroom. How's aunt Elbertje? is sister
Janetje
married yet? what's become of her old spark,
Gardt Van Wee? you don't know I am a relation to the
Schermerhornes. I'll tell you all about it, as the salmon
said to the flounder, after she had escaped the hook
with the bait. My second cousin, Winant Van Zandt,
married the sister of Bolee Van Wagenen, who was the
step daughter of Ostheim Van Dolenno konolye, I
can let you knowbut ugh! ugh!
The frau had got this length in her dissertation,
when a fit of coughing seized her, and gave a moment's
respite to her hearers, who, from her positive and rapid
manner of utterance, were not able either to explain
themselves to her, or even get in a word edgeways, she
having the whole field to herself. With more success
than heretofore, Arnyte seized the opportunity, and
freely discovered his name and situation, and his desire
and object in seeing the governor; and although a
retainer
of his enemy, he besought the dame's compassion
to afford him a chance to save his father's life, by an
interview
with colonel Sloughter. Frau Hyletje was
somewhat startled at this appeal, and although
apparently
fearful and indecisive, her feelings were evidently
enlisted
in favour of the stripling, whose suit was warmly
backed by his anxious companion.
By mine halidome, quoth the generous hearted
ensign, though this grumbling watch-dog growls at me
now, and forgets that like me, the great Salvator must
have made a ragged subject, when he left the Apulian
robbersan I see Hal Sloughter, by mine troth, I'll
make him change his tintsand 'faith, fair dame, an you
conduct us to him, I'll paint your pictureyou'll make
a noble head, and shall vie with Titian's daughter,
Rembrandt's
wife, and D'Urbino's mistress.
You're one of the Leisler family, said frau Hyletje
in reply to Arnyte, what a pretty set of konolye you've
all made of yourselvesa fine stew your father has put
the province in, as the cook said to the frying-panyou
are the youngest an't youyour father has had but two
children
has hea girl, she married Jacobus Milbourne, and
a boy that's you an't itwhy you are the image of your
motheryou look as like as two peas, as the farmer said
to his pigsonly to think now how you have grown out
one's recollectionwhy I was at your christeningit
seems like yesterdayand a rare frolic there wasthe
waits played before your father's door all night, and the
slaves beat the bonjo lustily the whole dayand then
what a feast there was, it done one good only to look at it,
as the fox said to the chickens when he found the wall too
high for him to leapwhy your mother was one of the
Van Alstynesa reputable familyno konolye among
themthey belonged to Poghkeepsing and were some
way connected to the Livingstons of the manorwell
you have got into a sad dish, as the scullion said to his
mate when the cat ran away with the meats, and you
need not tell me your story child, I know all about it
bad enough it is in all conscienceyour father's just sure
to be hanged child, so take comfort, for such things can't be
helped, as the doctor said to the sick man, when he found
he would die in spite of his medicine, what can't be cured
must be endured, is a wise saw that you must take profit
byso take comfort childtake comfort:and the
garralous dame indulged herself in this desultory gossip,
unmeaningly wounding where she thought to succour her
hearers, who found it in vain to breast the torrent of her
words, and it was not literally until her breath gave out
for the time that Arnyte was able again to exert himself
to interest her in affording him facility towards attaining
the object at which he was now bentat last with some
difficulty he gained her consent, though she observed
when expressing it, her fears that she was acting
unadvisedly
to introduce him to the chamber of the governor.
But Colonel Sloughter is a fine mana real
gentleman
,
nothing konolye about him whatever, said the dame,
as she led them in the house, there's something one can
see at once about a true cavalier and a great man, as the
crab said to the whalewhy there's no more pretension
about his excellence than there is about mehe talks as
familiar to me as if we had known each other for years,
let alone he is their majesties' governor general of the
provincebut then there's some inducement to his
honor's
condescension towards methere never was any
thing konolye about me or minewhich is more than
many people can sayno Larry Van Schawachofer of
the Brill who was my great grandfather was a
reputable
burgher as any in the Vaderlandts, gainsay him who
may, and then let the worst come to the worst, as the
butcher said to the ox when he snapt the rope that bound
him, if my giving you any means of access to his honor
should anger his excellence or Mienheer Bayardthough
child I can't see the harm in it, as the monkey said to the
looking-glassand it's no more than right you should strive
for your father, as bad a man as Jacobus Leisler is, and as
much as he deserves to be hung childfor thoughtake
comfort childI assure you I have no hopes of your
success
in saving Mienheer Leislerfor though I say, you do
not save him childand I get in trouble by doing what I do,
as the thief said to his booty when he robbed its owneryet
child I will have some consolation in knowing I assisted you
in your afflictions, and poor infirm creatures like we mortals
are, child, as the dominie said, shouldYou'll find his
excellence
in that chamber childbe of good heartthough I
am certain it's of no use your trying, you can't possibly
succeed, as the frying-pan said to the eel as he strove to
leap outI leave you here at the door, you'll find his
honor
very sociablethere's nothing konoyle about him
child.
Frau Hyletje, after entering the door of the mansion,
preceded Arnyte and Jost Stoll to the upper end of a huge
and low roofed hall, whose sides and pannels of dark oak,
gave it a sombre and gloomy aspect; there she abruptly
paused at the half opened entrance of a room, in which,
as her speech had indicated, Colonel Sloughter was to be
found, and with that which she deemed words of
assurance
at parting, she hastily left them to make such
way themselves across the threshold of the Governor's
apartment as they were best able,and it appeared as if
in the very accomplishment of her kind action towards
Arnyte, by her fearful and precipitate manner of
departure
,
that fran Hyletje, in spite of her words, repented
and failed in heart as she approached near to the
personage
whose anger her officiousness in introducing unwished
for suitors, as might be supposed, would arouse, and the
tenor of her speech did not disguise from her hearers her
timidity on this point so as to induce them to care to arrest
her retreating steps. The advantage of the situation
where they were left by frau Hyletje, and the partly
unclosed
door of the apartment, discovered to Arnyte and
his companion the interior and its inmates, by whom they
were as yet unnoticed and unperceived in the earnestness
of their engagement. The room was an old fashioned,
low locust wainscoted chamber, with heavy shelved fire
place, dark and polished with outpourings of the smoke, the
hearth and chimney jambs were of decorated and
ingeniously
inlaid Dutch-china tiles, on whose visage the
brightness of the fire glittered sparklingly, and the
shooting
and brilliant flame was reflected as on the surface of
a mirror; above the fire place hung black, soiled and
scarce distinguishable from age, neglect, and the
ascending
vapours of the smoke, a painting of the Flemish school,
which instantly attracted the eye of Jost Stoll, whose
whole attention was enwrapt in its examination the
moment
it caught his sight, so as to be utterly regardless, as
wont, of time, place, or situation, and every object about
him,the apartment otherwise was rather cumberously
than sumptuously furnished: huge satyr legged tables,
monstrous chairs, with damask cushions and feet of lions'
claws, and other articles equally unwieldy and
sumptuously
ornamented, the glass and picture frames being
formed by twisted ribbons, serpents, rose stalks, leaves,
and flowers, all entwining in gilt, according to the taste of
the time; indeed, the house of Mynheer Bayard, and its
internal arrangement and decorations assorted much with
his political feelings, having less traces of the Dutch than
assimilation towards the innovation of the fashions of the
English aristocracy of the time, as far as the intercouse
and means of importation of their splendour would
permit
the distant colonist to enjoy. Sloughter, somewhat
neglectfully attired, with looks flushed and disturbed, was
standing by a table, over which bundles of parchment and
papers were carelessly strewn, while Nicholas Bayard,
his host, was at his side, holding in his hand a roll of
vellum
,
and apparently earnestly addressing the Governor,
who seemed to listen to his words peevish and impatient;
the broken sentence which struck the ear of Arnyte as
he advanced to enter the chamber, thrilled through him,
and made him pause for the instant with breathless
solicitude
to listen to their converse.
But Colonel Sloughter, Bayard was saying, as in
conclusion of what might have been an expostulation and
argument to enforce the Governor's performance of that
which he was in some wise averse, and using in his
manner
of speech that candour of utterance and argument as
if from the lips of friendship, to induce Sloughter's
compliance
with the matter, but Colonel Sloughter, quoth
Nicholas Bayard, the Council have already negatived
the frivolous plea of the criminal; the court hath passed
sentence of death, such as the law hath dictated to them;
the warrant for his execution hath been drawn outI
hold it in my handYou cannot, permit me, Sir, to
remind
you, refuse that which is your duty, and perfect by
your signature this instrument which seals the peace of
this province! What, Sir, will the world, the people say
to this strange aversion to fulfil the sentence of the law?
the court hath decided, the Council have accorded that
he hath done the deed of a rebel and a traitor, and must
die the death
Let me tell you Colonel Bayard, suddenly
interrupted
Sloughter, and pacing the room with an abrupt step
and irritated airby mine honour let me tell you Colonel
Bayard, I am no boy to be led in leading strings, by
the Council or Court, or by living manyou have been
over zealous Sir, over hasty in this matteryou have
taken me unawares Sir,I had no idea that things had
been hurried to this last stage;that I feel hostile, yea,
condemn this man Leislerthat he deserves punishment,
exemplary punishment, no man is more willing than I am to
accordbut I will not be dictated to, this looks like
dictation
;
all here hath been too precipitatelast night the
trial
,
and at its heels, within an hour, the Council awards its
sanctionthat scarce breathed, ere I am demanded to sign
the warrant for the execution of a severe and desolating
sentence, a sentence which once put in force, there can
come no after repentance;Colonel Bayard I am a
soldier
,
and have in the heat of contest, in the fiery throng
of battle seen gorelife gore run like waterbut albeit I
must confess I shudder at taking a man's existence,at
quenching in cool blood the lamp of lifenathless your
forms and trickeries of lawwithout first having good and
mature consideration on the step ere I take it;I do also
remember me Colonel Bayard my own life within a day
was in the hands of others, I therefore lack not feeling
for a sufferer, albeit different in situation, though like
exposedI will not be rash Sir, there shall be no speedy
work, things shall be reflected onand as for the people
Sir,what are the people, you yourself have decried
thembeasts of burthen, hounds that must obey the beck
of their masters; they shall not dictate, Colonel Bayard,
my course, I am sufficient judge I hope of right or wrong
without their gainsay.
Your exellencie most assurely looketh on the
business
erroneously, returned Bayard in a soothing tone of
voice, it hath never been the part, act, or intention of
the court that tried Jacobus Leisleror your faithful
counsel in performing the severe duty assigned them in
the samenor, speaking honestly Colonel Sloughter hath
it been, or is it the design of Nicholas Bayard your firm
well wisher to point out for ill, or enforce your adoption
of any coursethis we leave most respectfully to your
better judgmentbut that it well becomes us, our stations,
our allegiance to their sacred majesties as most dutiful and
loyal subjects, who, in our hearts, abhor and detest all the
rebellious, arbitrary, and illegal proceedings of the late
usurpers of their majesties' authority over this province;
who, from the bottom of our hearts, I repeat, with all
integrity
acknowledge and declare that there are none that can
or ought to have right to rule or govern their majesties'
subjects here in New-Yorke, but by their majesties'
proper
commission and authority, which is now placed in your
excellency. Under these pure feelings, we are
enspirited
to advise, to suggest, and I will assert it, Colonel
Sloughter, to urge that which we in faith believe is sound
policy, and best conducive to the conservation of the
tranquillity of the inhabitants of this colony; and if, I say,
your excellency, any of us, in the pursuance of this
laudable
endeavour, have been too pertinacious, or rather
frankly speaking, for that way I interpret your words,
Colonel Sloughter,if the honest and anxious zeal of
Nicholas Bayard hath been miscontrued, and from my
exertions
for the public weal, unfavourable impressions
have visited your excellency's mind, I do make bold to
say that my earnest desire, my strenuous wish for your
excellency's welfare, and of their majesties' dominions in
Vol. II. 27
America, hath alone been the cause, these have
o'erleapt
discretiona plain man like me, your excellency,
knows not the art to control his honest feelings; for I
will not disguise it, Sir, the death of Jacobus Leisler is,
in my poor opinion, sought at your hands an expiatory
offering
,
not alone to the magnitude of his crime, but at
once as a terrible ensample to his secret and unsubdued
partizans, who remain hidden in the core of the
multitude
,
and moreover, to the wishes, hopes, and offended
feelings of the well affected, and this must be immediate:
for permit me to remind you, that delays breed
obstacles
as well as dangers, which, to one who so well knows
the fickle nature of the people with whom you have to
deal as I do, and of whose violence and madness of
excitement
in the massacre of the traitor Milbourne, your
excellency
hath a stern specimen,may ground some fears
that, an public justice be not straightforth satisfied,
disturbances
,
that will give no slight trouble to quell, may
arise; and your excellency's knowledge of mankind, I
doubt not, hath taught you ere now, that in such times of
civil commotion, the lives, properties, nay, sir, both friend
and foe are at peril. I beseech your excellency to pause
and reflect on the convulsed state of this province, ere,
by an undue leniency, or may I without offence so term
it, for want of an instantaneous firmness of action, the
unhappy
citizens of New-Yorke are thrown back into that
terrific state of disorder, wherefrom, I was flattering
myself
,
the benignant presence of your excellency was
extricating
them.
To the first part of this exhortation of Bayard, the
Governor listened fretfully and unwillingly, as one who
hears an argument which is at discord with his own
opinions
;
but ere the speaker had finished, his uneasy air and
broken gait, as he measured the length of the apartment
with pensive strides, marked the force of the impressions
which he received from the insidious foeman of the
suffering
LeislerSloughter heard his counsellor through,
and then stood with hand raised to his thoughtful brow,
motionless and silent for a time, while Bayard, as if he
read the conflict of his mind, with a keen yet exulting
look regarded his deliberations.
Colonel Bayard, it is not for me to deny that what
you advance is not of moment, said the Governor at
length, though the hesitation and decision of his mind
were perceptible in his manner, yet, my friend, I
cannot
rid me of an inclination to delay the last and violent
step you advise; it certainly doth strike me at once as
dangerous as well as impolitic, and these promptings I
have not the resolution to subdue, to cut off a man, who
like Leisler, (for this, nathless later misdeeds, must be
allowed him in all praise,) hath so vigorously and early
appeared for William of Orange, and whose conduct hath
so signally contributed to the revolution; and I would
have you remember, I have others besides the people of
this province to account to for my actionsI have doubts,
sir, how a deed of so bloody a cast as that suggested will
be received at Whitehall.
In my poor judgment, what your excellency hath
thrown out, though natural, are unfounded fears, if
without
offence I may apply the term on the matter in
question
,
eagerly responded Nicholas Bayard, perceiving
the advantage he was fast gaining over the wavering
mind of the governor, and I think the least reflection
on the part of one, whose discrimination is usually so just
and clear on most subjects, will at once convince your
excellency's latent doubts that what I argue is strictly
right and unanswerable. I apprehend, that whatever
hesitation your excellency labours under, on such points
as your excellency has been pleased to mention, can be
satisfied; for let me ask your excellency, whether a man,
who having preserved another from death, murthers
afterwards
the object of such charity, deserves or ought to
escape
the liability of the law for the life he takes, forsooth,
because at first, at imminent hazards, he saved that very
life which later he destroys; again, I would seek at your
excellency what favour of gratitude doth one deserve who
having bestowed inadvertently a great benefit on his
fellow
,
no sooner discovers its worth, than he robs him
thereofis not this Leisler's case? but I will go on and
put the fact to conviction: what doth he merit, who, for
his own ambition strikes off the shackles with which a
tyrant binds his serfs, and who no sooner hath attained
his conquest than he seeks, base born as he is, to fill that
fallen tyrant's place? Yes, your excellency, what hath
Leisler done but enacted the part of a faithful subject
that he might the better play the rebel and the traitor?
shall a man who commits a crime, for the deceptive
and superficial show of a former day, escape legal
punishment? Shall a highwayman plead that in the days
of his virtue he gave charity? Your excellency's good
sense (with due submission) must coincide with my
assertion
,
that such a criminal should be an ensample to the
world, to show how just the punishment for an
aberration
from virtuebut the actions of Jacobus Leisler
have not been such as to offer themselves in mitigation
of his sentenceyour excellency, the province is
convinced
of the magnitude of his guilt, and the
righteousness
of a severe and exemplary punishmentand as for
the feelings at Courtas for the reception of his death
at Whitehallwhat friendswhat mourners can a
convicted
traitora hardened rebel have in the hallowed
circle of their sacred majestiesGod keep all such from
their presencebesides, can any one be averse to the
true administration of justicecan any man regret or be
offended at the sentence of a just and impartial Court
no your excellency, the traitor Jacobus Leisler has been
condemned by the law of the land, and whatever blame
should come, must fall on that lawyou made it not
neither did you try the criminalbut you fulfil by
signing
his death-warrant, the high and imperious dictates
that the law hath awarded your station; I am bold to say
it Sir, you fulfil your duty only by the actyour excellency
may as well refuse the death of a robber, a pirate, a
murtherer, as to stand between the appointed sentence
of the law and a convicted traitor.
The irresolution of Governor Sloughter sank before
the forceful earnestness and perseverance of the cold
hearted Bayard, he unfolded slowly his arms, and raised
his head from the meditative posture in which it had
reclined
on his breast, and there was a slight and tremulous
movement of his under lip as he compressed it inward,
and his brows contracted themselves in the sternness of
determination, as his reluctance momently gave way and
yielded to the warmth of representation by which he was
pressedthe weakness of Colonel Sloughter was evident,
and well did the wily Bayard know the chord of mastery to
work onfor while he paraded forth his respect and
submission
,
he in fact governed him whose commands he
appeared
to worship as a servile slave: for at the same time by
the guileful manner wherewith he pronounced his
sentiments
and enforced his arguments for Leisler's execution,
he flattered the selfish pride of a vain manquick, irritable
and alive to that he deemed detractive either to his
independence
of opinion or authorityas in the
advancement
of his reasons he seemed alone to appeal to the
sagacity and discretion of him whom he addressed, as if in
the perception of each fact he used, the hearer had
preceded
the speaker, and as from that which he asserted
common sense and experience could not deterioratehe
also lulled in slumber all the political apprehensions of
personal consequences which deterred the accedence of
the governor to the act he sought his completionand
moreover by a cunning show of disinterested honestyan
ardent desire for the welfare as well as the credit of his
government, to which the most imbecile ruler is awake;
he finally succeeded in bending Colonel Sloughter to his
willthus it is that the credulous, unwary, and weak
minded when they least suspect it, when most boastful of
their freedom are in the thraldom, and dwindle down into
the passive tool of vile and designing knavesand by
surrendering heedlessly, and without due caution the
impulses
of their own generous hearts to the fine spun
sophistry
invented for their deception; from their
characters
or stations the opprobrium of villanies, whose
benefit
they reap not fall on their heads, while their directors
and advisers covered and in secret escape pursuit, and
banquet on the spoil, to gain which they have dared no
dangerreceiving the advantages of another's blinded
27*
follyBayard eagerly snatched a pen from the standish
that stood near, and thrusting it with an air that even
controlled as it was by policy and art, bespoke
anticipated
trumph, and interest in the event of a personal
nature
,
in the pliant hand of the governor which had been
partially lifted to receive it, he officiously unrolled the
warrant and spread it out before Colonel Sloughter to
receive his signature.
Colonel Bayard, I owe this man Leisler, however
affected by his imprudence, no animosity; I am moved
by no resentment of a personal nature whatever. In
placing my name to the warrant for his execution, I
would have it understood, I perform an act rendered
necessary
,
by the event of his trial. It is an approval of
the court I can neither avoid nor withhold, as being
honoured by their majesties' commission over this
province
;
and albeit, I can find no room for the exercise of
mercy, considering the enormity of guilt committed by
the unfortunate wretchfor his crime hath truly placed
his blood on his own head.
As the governor expressed these words, he
approached
the open warrant, and leaned over it as about to
commence
the writing, which was to seal for ever the fate of
his fallen predecessor.
Hold, colonel Sloughter, an instant, forbear the
fearful deed that takes his lifewhile thus clasping your
knees, I supplicate you to spare my father. And as
he spoke, Arnyte rushed breathless into the apartment,
and cast himself at the governor's feet.
By mine halidome, that is by an old master,I'll
wager it is from the brush of Huysum,I know it by
the stiffness of his grouping, exclaimed Jost Stoll, as he
followed the steps of young Leisler, his attention
evidently
as much rivetted to the picture, which had first
engaged his sight, as either by the presence of the
governor
,
or that which was stirring in the scene, troth,
your excellence, I greet ye from my heart:by the by,
who painted that? the figures are not bada little
rough, thoughby the glory of Sir Godfrey, there are
no mean touches about the piece.
Heaven and earth! what do I beholdmy brave
delivererensign Jost Stoll aliveare miracles rife?
ejaculated the governor simultaneously with their
entrance
.
Language can scarce realize the startled and amazed
looks of the inmates of that room, at this most
unexpected
and undreamed of interruption, at a moment so
interesting
and important, and when to the accordance of
the wishes of his political foeman, the blood of Leisler
was about to be yielded irrevocably. Marvel and ire
were blended in the visage and action of Bayard, whose
every feature scowled in malignancy, at the intrusion.
The unused pen dropped from the palsied fingers of
Sloughter, as he turned his eyes on the youth and his
companion in alternate wonder and alarm, gazing on
each, as in the lapses of a vision, while his eye ran over
their persons as one that scans a thing, scarce reconciled
to the mind as real, or as beings given up from the grave
or dropped from some bursting of a stormy cloud;an
instant's glance served for recognitionbut the
governor's
gaze rested last and longest, reverting from the
well known countenance of the ensign, which it had met
pleased and astonished, to the haggard and care worn
lineaments of the striplingwhile the attitude in which
the youth had prostrated himself in humbleness and
misery, had his words, his piercing and grief-like tones,
been unheard, could not be misconstrued; they struck
to the soul of Sloughterthey shot in his ears like bolts
of burning iron, and for the moment's breath, his blood
flowed backward to his heart, leaving him pale as death,
and then, sudden as their retreat, the hot fountains of
his veins swelled upwards to his crimsoned cheeks.
What, thou the son of Leislerdoth sense or
hearing
mock me? muttered he in a faint accent of
surprise
and agitation, and he paused for a moment, like
one who strives to recover from the stunning force of a
thunder shock, ere he continuedbrave and noble
youth, pursued he, this should not beit doth shame
me greatly, to see thee thus:it is not for him who
saved my life, at my knee thus in lowliness to seek his
suit; come, my preserver, to my bosomthe place next
to my heart, thou deservest to fillto my arms, sir
prithee, rise to my heart! And with a caress of
kindness
,
he endeavoured to lift the stripling from his
humble
posture.
Nay, nay, your excellency doth yourself wrong,
quoth Arnyte, repelling his attempt with animation, I
come not here your creditor nor your equalbut as the
son of a condemned man; I am the wretched child of
the forlorn and unfortunate Jacobus Leisler; of him,
whose miserable destruction you were but now about to
consummate; by all that earth and heaven holds sacred,
I do conjure, implore and pray you, not to sign, not to
touch that horrid and bloody instrumentfor God's sake,
sign it not, but spare, oh, spare the life of my poor
father
.
And as he spoke, he clung to the governor in
the wild agony of passionate entreaty, while his eyes,
with a tearful and piteous expression of pleading, were
raised to the countenance of Sloughter, who,
undetermined
,
yet shaken, listened to the beseechings of the
stripling, his aspect disturbed, and his frame trembling
with palpable emotion.
Bayard having rallied his amazement at young
Leisler's
presence, and harassed with fearful forebodings as
to its evident effect on Sloughter, in which he already
beheld
the downfal and disappointment of his hopes, now
advanced, and prepared to interpose himself before the
influence of the petitioner.
Young man, quoth he, with affected feeling, placing
as he spoke, his hand gently on the youth's shoulder, as
with intent to assist him in kindness from his suppliant
position, your own sense must make you aware how
unavailing under the present circumstances, is this
conduct
;
you are exhausting your strength and nerves to
no purport whatever, except at once cruelly lacerating and
rending the tender heart of his excellency. I speak for him,
Mienheer LeislerI would wish to spare him the regret
and sorrow of denial to you, to whom he acknowledges such
obligation; he hath the sympathy of a man for your
situation
;
his heart, as you cannot but be convinced of,
bleeds for you at every pore; but stern needcessitythe
duty enjoined on himthe high place which he fills,
hath made him the dispenser of the lawand it
behooves
not to commingle therewith, ought personaland
were it his own, nathless your father, he could notnay
boy, he dare not for his consciencefor his honor's sake
grant more than his commiseration for the unhappy
man.
The voice of Bayard was nervous and emphatic in its
tone, and with a stern and meaning look as he uttered his
words he perused the features of the Governor, wherein
were painted the conflicting struggles of his soul,
paramount
in which his failing resolution could be read
Sloughter seemed to shrink before the fixed gaze of
Bayard
as conscious of his weakness, and almost like a
school-boy humbled before the haughty frown of his
domineering
preceptor; he noted the latter sentence uttered
by Bayard, who plainly by his manner appeared rather as
if he addressed them to Colonel Sloughter's attention
than to the stripling.
When Arnyte felt the touch of the mortal foe of his
name, his very flesh seemed to quiver and shrunk from
the grasp, as if the hand whose weight was on him bore
contagion to his blood; while his cheek grew to a livid
hue, and he drew his breath long, heavily, and thick
between
his clenched teeth, and his eyes sparkled in deep
rage as he scanned the living lineaments of rooted hate;
I asked not of thee, Colonel Bayard, to back my suit,
retorted the youth, quickly turning on the unwelcome and
unfriendly intermeddler; his voice sharp with sarcastic
anger, and his fiery spirit darting from his speaking
visage
as it would have withered his adversary; a son of
the house of Leisler could expect no favour from such
as thee, it might as well be demanded of the treacherous
tiger to surrender from the gripe of his merciless jaws the
fresh slain victim, ere he had glutted his ruthless appetite
on a drop of the gore; or the fierce and ravenous
vulture
to yield a morsel of the flesh that its beak hath
stripped from the carcass of the dead, as to suppose that
Nicholas Bayard would aid in preserving the life of
Jacobus
Leisler: no, Mienheer continued Arnyte severely,
the rather when the scaffold is prepared, be you ready
at hand with axe and cord, lest the stout heart of the
executioner fail him in that awful hour of need, and that
you may make your work sure
Arnyte paused awhile as he me with calm and bold front
the grim smile of unutterable malice that passed over the
face of his opponent, as he relaxed the hold he had taken
upon the garment of the youthBayard drew himself back
with high and lofty motion, while his eye lowered in dark,
quenchless, and insatiate ire upon the offender, like the
arrowy fire of a gloomy cloud that darts from the black
and stormy heaven towards the palaces of earth as eager
for destruction.
Nay Colonel Bayard it is not meet that you restrain
Mienheer Leisler, quoth the Governor, it surely
becomes me to hear the young man ere I decide on
his application, or his father's death, it is just, it is
fair, Colonel Bayard! Bayard answered only with a
bitter
sneer, and Arnyte turned towards the Governor:
Be ye not deaf of ear and of heart, and ye will hear me
with compassion, he said, the high tone wherewith he
had attacked Bayard changing to one of almost womanish
lamentation, yes, it is thy feet Colonel Sloughter I
embrace
it
is to you I lift my hands in suppliance in
affliction
,
for thou hast the power and can save him, and he
clasped his hands in the strenuousness of his solicitation,
spare, oh spare he wildly cried, my father's life!
The Governor in silence covered his face to conceal his
agitation: Spare the life of Jacobus Leisler, the youth
continued, I ask it at your hands, not by the memory of
such services as I may have rendered you in extremity
not by the blood which as water I would have poured
out to shield you from the poniard of the assassinbut I
seek it from your mercy, from your humanitywhatever
have been his crimes for which he deserves to suffer,
though a parent is never guilty in the eyes of his child,
yet far be it from me now to dispute themyet, oh I
entreat
let not his evil deeds be heard, blot them out from
the calendar of his days and spare himI beg it of you
by the love you have borne to the protectors of your own
infancyby your regard for your own parents in days gone
byby the thousand ties that bound you to them while
livingby your reverence for them in deathby the
dust of their gravesI pray you spare him, he is my
parent; make not our home a place of desolation, widow
not my mother, have mercy on him who now begs it from
youoh! you have never had the heart of a son an you
refuse me, an you deny, you never could have received
or known the fond and tender blandishments, the
multitudinous
cares that link the parent and his offspring, or
you could not hear in vain the voice of a son who pleads for
his father's lifeoh! there is a sacredness in the very
name of a parent, that will make it sacrilege to harm a
single hair of his revered headoh! forbear, forbear the
horrid death you have marked out for him: let him not
die the death of infamy; expose him not to the heartless
scorn of an infuriated rabble, who will but mock his
agoniesyour heartstrings must be insensible and
bloodless
,
your eyes stone an they can look on the suffering ye
have doomed him to, and not be blasted; bethink you
yet but a little while, a few circling years death will
claim his own, the sorrows he hath seen will bow him to
the gravecut not short by violence his brief span of
years, and far from this land of wo in poverty, in exile,
our prayers, our blessings shall stream up in incense to
theeoh! spare him, spare him from the scaffold;it is
hard to endure the thought of parting, when the course
of age in its infirmity brings the hoary headed man unto
the last resting place of mortalitybut that death of
blood and crimethat fearful deathit will madden me
oh God have mercyoh spare his precious life!I
call on you Colonel Sloughter by your solemn promise in
the hour of gratitudeplighted in the sight of heaven and
of earththe words are wrought on my heart
remember
that pledgewhen you refused what I might ask,
though it were that which you might not well doyet if
you refused it, you called on the face of heaven which
had then so smiled upon you, to be turned for ever from
your fortunesI ask the life of Jacobus Leisler at your
lipsspare, oh spare my father's life!
Sloughter could no longer suppress the emotion that
shook his frame in violence, beyond all caution;-prudence,
former determination, and every feeling of hereafter
consequence
,
were lost in the sight of the suppliant before
him.
He shall not die! he shall not die! exclaimed the
Governor, in an almost involuntary ejaculation.
This annunciation struck Arnyte with an almost
electric
powerit came on his ear with a stunning forcehe
heard the words that proclaimed safety to his father at
first in breathless amazement, as if he could scarce be
assured of the reality of the sound, even while he listened,
or as though he had not understood that which had been
said; nor when the lips of the Governor closed was his
stupor broken; for he stirred not eye nor limb, and he
stood for the time as one frozen in an attitude of
attention
;
yet this lasted not, for suddenly his eyes rolled in
wild exultation, and with a passionate burst of joy, he
struggled to press the hand of the governor to his
quivering
lips.
Thou hast said it! he cried, rejoicingly, he shall
not die! he shall not die!
The strength of the stripling, exhausted by repeated
exertions, could support him no longer; for the sudden
fulfilment of hope,the reception of good and evil are
oftentimes attended with similar effects, and madness hath
been caused by both, so nearly allied are the emotions of
happiness and sorrow;all that had upheld Arnyte in the
misery he had passed through, now apparently deserted
him with the abrupt turn of fortune, and as he uttered
the last words in a strain of almost incoherent rapture, he
contended for an instant against the excess of agitation
which seemed nearly to choak him; but his endeavour
was fruitless, and a wild and hysteric passion of tears and
of laughter, started from his lips, ere he dropt down at
the feet of Sloughter in a paroxysm of death-like
insensibility
.
Help! Colonel Bayard, Jost Stoll, help! for God's
sake! the boy is dying! help to bear him in the air!
exclaimed the governor in alarm, as he dragged the
senseless youth towards the window of the apartment.
Bayard answered the call with slow and reluctant step,
apparently unmoved by the fearful situation of young
Leisler, and as though wishing the worst might happen
ere his interference. Not so Jost Stoll; the Ensign, as
he beheld the stripling fall to the earth, dashed from his
hand the pencil that it held, and the now neglected
death-warrant
,
which, in the mania of the moment, with utter
indifference as to the consequence, and it would have
been the same with a paper of even more importance,
he had snatched up and was transferring on its surface,
where there was a blank to be found, the leading traits of
that which was passing before his eyes, with his usual
exclamations
of delight at the varied attitudes and passions
of the living group he was drawing; an observer,
unattended
to by the more interested actors; but when he
marked the fading colour of Arnyte's countenance, every
other consideration vanished, and he threw from him all
incumbrances, and rushed in haste to the stripling's
assistance
.
Young Leisler was lifted forward between Jost
Stoll and Colonel Sloughter, while Bayard, as loathing
the object of their care, with slow hand, threw back the
casement and admitted the breeze to enter the chamber
freely; and while its refreshing coolness scattered his
disordered locks upon his scarce throbbing temples, his
supporters chafed his white and pallid brow, and rubbed
to warmth his blood deserted hands. An interval of
almost
breathless expectation and incertitude passed, ere
their utmost endeavours were able to recall a sign of
reanimation
,
and they had nearly despaired of success in
their anxious attempts, ere the reviving hue of life
revisited
and mingled its faint tinge on the colourless cheek
of the stripling, and the first prognostication of returning
consciousness, showed itself in a slight tremour that
passed over his features;and then followed and became
perceptible a quick, short respiration, like that of a
sleeping
infant, while a faint spark of intelligence emanated
through the shadows of his long dark eye lashes, whose
Vol. II. 28
drooping lids slowly unclosed as from a dead sleep, and
there broke a sudden, low, and scarce articulate sound,
like the dying murmur of a distant echo, from his parted
lips, which were fast empurpled with the rush of blood.
By mine halidome, quoth Jost Stoll, his
accustomed
disposition again resuming its power in the
assurance
of the moment, as his fears, which had been
strongly excited for the recovery of the youth, were
somewhat relieved, and his anxiety for his safety
diminished
,
as he felt sensibly the renewed beatings of
Arnyte's
heart against the pressure of his watchful hand,
By mine halidome, said he, much would I give, had
I a pallet well assorted here, that I might catch the
changes of his colourgad, the tints would immortalize
me; what an inimitable subject he would make for the
Scripture piece of Elisha raising the widow's son from
deaththe life just returning to the before pallid cheek
the eye just openingoh, he certainly would make a
capital figure for the widow's sonwhat lovely,
beautiful
tintsthey vie with the best ever laid out by the
brush of Rubens.
Where am Iwhere is my father? murmured the
youth, as he recovered from his faintness, there seems
a weight as if of clotted blood, upon my brainwhere
am I? exclaimed Arnyte, as he glanced wildly around.
He passed his hand rapidly across his brow, ay, I
remember
it all, nowthou hast said thou wouldst spare
my father's lifesay I not right? pursued he, or can
it be possible I have been in the frenzied delirium of
fever
,
for the horrible confusion of a dream is on my brain
I pray you, mock me not with false comfortthou
hast surely said he shall not die.
Be certain the life of Jacob Leisler is safe, said
colonel Sloughter, I prithee calm thyself, your frame
cannot bear these frantic paroxysms.
Thank heaven! thank heaven, I heard right,
exclaimed
Arnyte, the words are true, he shall not die!
Oh, God, the sound darts through my brain, and rushes
on my heartha! ha! ha!this agony of joy will
madden
mehe shall not die! he shall not die!
I beg of you be composed, said the governor.
Composedcalmay, I am composedcalmand
yet there is a tumult here within, that vies with the
tempest
driven ocean in its rage, continued Arnyte, beating
his bosom, great God, how shall I express the wild
rush of happiness, that fills every vein as with a flood?
he shall not die! you have said my father shall live! ah,
your excellency, can words ever express all this
throbbing
heart would declare to you, oh let me fall down at
your feet, thus cling for ever, and pour out in one
endless
stream of weeping, as though the sluices of my
eyes were rent, my never ceasing blessingmy untiring
gratitudebut this is not for me alonemy whole race
yes, and chief of all he whose life you have spared, will
join me in these thanks.
Nay, nay, my good youth, vainly interposed the
governor.
Yes, your excellency, when you look on that aged
man, continued Arnyte, when you see him to whom your
word hath given life, free and breathing the air of
heaven
when
you hear him call down the choicest of
blessings
in the store of providence on his benefactor, then
will you know the value of the gift you have extended
to our afflictionsthen will you know how the obligation
is appreciatedbut ah, he, my father, is not here; no,
he still lingers in his darksome and solitary dungeon, nor
knows the mercy that has been extended him; it shall
be mine to bear him the gladsome tidingsay, generous
benefactor, at once I will wend me to that prison house,
and he shall worship thy name.
In truth, I fear me, noble boy, you are not equal to
the task; your frame already weak and exhausted, will
scarce bear such exertion and fatigue; you shall remain
here, while I despatch a messenger to the Stadthuis, who
will inform Jacobus Leisler, that for the son's sake, I
have pardoned the father's errors.
I will crave your excellence to bear with me,
replied
Arnyte with ardour, you know not the power,
the strength, left in these limbsthey could accomplish
more than may be supposed, in such a duty; bethink ye,
too, of my father's wretched situationhis chains, and
the insults heaped on him in that vile prison, and all that
he momently suffers, even while I now linger. Who
then so swift, so fit on such an errand of joy, as his son?
others know not the worth of every instant; he whom
your excellency's kindness might select, might be
laggard
;
indifferent in feelings for the sad prisoner, he
would not count the loss of time; he has no father to
release, and cannot feel like me, how much it is to cheat
the lot, the mourner's lot, of even a pangno! though
your excellency seems incredible of my boastfor it is
true, but now, I gave way to weakness, yet believe me,
my nerves are braced as iron, and my sinews seem as if
a giant's power had been infused in my system; the
very winds themselves, in their wild waftings, shall be
shamed by the course of a child, who, upborne by
duty
and by joy, files on the sacred errand that sooths the
sorrows of a despairing parent.
Your excellency must perceive, that prompted by
such noble springs of nature, it is useless to dissuade the
young man from being in person the first to bear the
good news of his deliverance to Mienheer Leisler;
quoth Nicholas Bayard who, with ill cloaked chagrin,
had been the sullen and silent spectator of the
over-throw
of his deep laid plans, and whose countenance
had suddenly cleared up during Arnyte's last speech,
and now bore no trace of discontent, and I, for my
own part, must say, that I at once applaud the motives,
and admire the propriety, of the action and intention of
this praiseworthy stripling, he continued, with apparent
frankness, I must confess me, colonel Sloughter, that I
did disapprove of mercy towards Jacobus Leisler, for I
deemed it wrong, one so criminal should escape severe
punishment; but since the matter is as it standssince
your excellency hath been so moved by the touching
distress of his sonand I must say, I myself heard the
youth with no little emotion; my heart bled in pity, as
he spoke for his life, and I did forget the guilt, while the
innocent interceded, and wonder not at your
excellency's
being prevailed on to extend a pardon and
forgiveness
to the culprit, being so powerfully pressed therefor;
none but a brute could have done otherwiseand since,
I repeat, your excellency hath granted clemency towards
Mienheer Leisler, it becomes me to state, that as to
every personal feeling of my own, I am gratified at the
event. Whatever false suggestions may be started to
the contrary by my enemies, I assert, I have acted
towards
Jacobus Leisler in all things, even in persuading
his execution, by that which I deemed for the best
interest
of the publicthe peace and safety of this
province
.
No liberal-minded man can blame me for what I
have done, what I may have advisedhaving solely
acted under such impressions; but let me add,
admiration
for the son hath conquered in my breast even those
prudent wishes for the father's death; and I am now
somewhat inclined to think, your excellency, mercy in
this case will do more towards planting the olive in this
colony, than would harsh measures. If I am not
deceived
,
there is a pledge in the countenance of young
Mienheer Leisler, to the effect that he will not be
backward
in the compact of peace; and since the urgency
of his filial duty demands his leaving my roof so soon, I
would say it becomes him not to part in anger with his
host. I doubt not he hath deemed me an enemy, but
let the past be forgotten; I have made the first advance,
though an older manand if he will accept the
courtesy
,
a horse from my stable, than whose breed none
swifter
ever ran, awaits his order to bear him to the city on
his pious errandwhile it shall be my duty, as my office
of secretary to your excellency's dictates, to have the
formal pardon drawn out; and as its completion would
only delay Mienheer Leisler's impatience, as soon as it
is sanctioned by your excellency, it shall be sent for the
immediate release of Jacobus Leisler. I extend my
hand and desire your friendship, young man.
Although there was as it seemed a loathing which he
could not conquer in the heart of Arnyte towards
Leisler
,
yet in the excess of happiness, his very enemy
appeared
less hatefuland the sentiments and actions,
which at another time from Bayard would only have
28*
elicited caution and an idea of duplicity, were in a mind
pervaded with pleasure, met with confidence. So
sudden
and inconsistent is the transition of the human
feelings
,
that he, that but awhile before looked with an eye
jaundiced by grief upon mankind, now excited by a
favourable
change of momentary fortune, viewed even
him who he had reason to believe an implacable and
wily foe, with kindness, and became easily a rash and
ready victim for deception. Arnyte had no time nor
feeling for cool deliberation on the evidently studied form
by which Bayard had addressed himhe but glanced his
eyes towards him, for he saw the governor appeared
gratified with Bayard's behaviour, and with looks
expectant
and somewhat wistfully, was gazing on his
countenance
.
I will not by a remembrance of ancient enmity mar
the satisfaction of the present moment, said he,
meeting
with a cordial grasp the hand that was offered him,
and, colonel Bayard, I do accept the courtesy you
proffer; and albeit, I hope from my very heart, that in
this tendered kindness, all animosity between the names
of Bayard and Leisler may for ever cease. I will attend
where you lead, sirfor time doth wear, and I long for
my father's arms. God keep your excellency!And
having made his leave of colonel Sloughter and Jost
Stoll, Arnyte with a rapid pace, followed Bayard from
the apartment. His conductor, as he preceded him, by
various little attentions evidently endeavoured to win
his confidence, and to erase from out the tablet of his
breast, the late rankling sores and wounds cut by long
rooted hate and ire.
SECTION III.Ended.
More than an hour elapsed before Bayard, after his
departure with Arnyte, returned to the apartment
wherein
Colonel Sloughter and Jost Stoll had remained, and
they during that period were too busily engaged to mark
its progress, while they interchanged at once relations of
their escapes from the hands of Kid and his crew, and
their mutual congratulations on each other's safety, so
that when their host entered the room, after his
temporary
absence, they were scarce aware of the length of
time that had been consumed in their intercourse. The
aspect of Bayard as he advanced towards his guests, was
calm, clear, and placid as a summer stream at mid-day,
when no breeze lives to ruffle its limpid surface; all
clouds had fled his brows, which were open and free as
innocence itself; but yet amidst all his courteous bearing
and collected manner, the keen eye of observance might
have descried, but which by his companions was
unmarked
,
that ever and anon an expression shot upon his
countenancea movement of feature between a smile and
a sneer, whose indefinite meaning was hard to be read,
as whether applying in contempt to those whom he was
addressing, as the pagan worships his idol, or as the
fantasy
that mingled with some wandering thought of things
not present to his vision, and perhaps ideal. In the look,
the timid and suspicious would have drawn an evil
inference
,
without being able to trace the reason; for it was
as the flash of a serpent's eye, caught then lost in its
ambushment
in the green and deceitful grass of the savanna,
whose forest of tangled spears might in vain be searched
for a trace of the danger, the reality of which is only made
known when too late to escape the darting fang of the
treacherous animal. Bayard explained the cause of the
delay of his return, by informing Colonel Sloughter that
his absence had been occasioned by the reception of
several
of his excellency's council, and many of the leading
members of the new assembly for the province, which,
according to the writs of summons issued by his
excellency's
order to the sheriffs of the different counties, was to
commence its session early in the coming month, had
arrived
at the mansion for the purpose of assuring his
excellency
of the entire devotedness of the Legislature to
the views of the Governor, and who now remained
awaiting
the presence of Colonel Sloughter for personal
communication
to that purport. Bayard also mentioned that
he had taken the liberty to order a preparation for such
proper entertainment as his residence supplied, for the
use and refreshment of his excellency and his friends, and
to partake of the same, he now invited him and the
ensign
,
Jost Stoll; for the latter of whom was prudently
hinted that a change of apparel was in readiness.
Colonel Bayard, in thus addressing the Governor, but
slightly touched on the name of Leisler; and that only to
a direct inquiry of Colonel Sloughter,he answered that
he had seen Arnyte depart, and that the pardon was in a
state of forwardness, and would very shortly be handed
to his excellency for approbation; but he the rather
appeared
to avoid and pass over rapidly all that related to
the object of his late reconciliation, or of the condemned
parent of the stripling; he spoke but briefly and carelessly
on the matter, and shunned with evident caution a recur
rence of discourse upon the subject, by artfully directing
the governor's attention to points of political importance,
the thought and discussion of which at once engrossed his
excellency when started, to the manifest forgetfulness of
of all minor objects. Colonel Sloughter proceeded with
Bayard to meet his expectant visitors; but he was
somewhat
startled on entering the apartment where they were
assembled, to behold a table spread forth with the luxu
ries of a sumptuous feast, and the arrangement of festival
which pervaded the whole chamber, and for which he
had in nowise been prepared; neither from the words
of Bayard had he drawn any thing which could intimate
the brilliance that surrounded him, when he entered the
room, as with the suddenness of magic; so much was he
taken unawares by the appearance of festivity, the
gorgeous
glitter that met his dazzled sight, and the gay,
smiling, and rich attired assemblage who pressed to greet
his entrance, that he yielded unreservedly, the very
direction
of his motions, to his conductor, who appeared,
had an opportunity chanced, to have no wish for further
explanation; and he allowed himself to be ushered by
Bayard through the bowing throng, to a seat which
seemed to have been destined for him at the head of the
feast, the enjoyment of which apparently had only wanted
his sanction to have commenced; and although Colonel
Sloughter was astonished at the splendour and the crowd
to which he was introduced, yet unwarned as he was
of the least expectation, beyond the simple reception of
his friends, he could not view the spectacle that
greeted
him as other than a most respectful and flattering
attention
on the part of his host, secretly and delicately
planned, at once to amaze and please him with unlooked
for homage; and the more the Governor reflected on the
art with which he had been kept in ignorance of the
getting
up of the entertainment, which he construed as a
celebration of his safe arrival, and success in putting
down sedition in the very outset of his government of the
province, the greater was the gratification to his vanity
and he lent himself to the warm glances of an almost
apparent worship, that were bent upon him as he were a
superior beinga star among the men with whom he
mingled without suspicion or deeper thought. How weak
how feeble the penetration which from the outer beauty of
an object sets its intrinsic worth, or that gathers faith from
false show, nor descries the deep and wily artifice
beneath
the gaud which covers but to blind the incautious
eyecut credulity is the failing of many, and when
assailed
by sycophantic hypocrisy it seems to love its own
destruction, and he that should be the most shunned is
soonest embraced, for the darkest villain too often wears
the goodliest outside, and he whose specious tongue and
bearing cloaks his foul nature, can worm into the
confidence
,
while the honest are scorned; and little did
Colonel
Sloughter, as he scanned with the sparkling glance of
pleasure, the tasteful decorations, the rich and costly
food that loaded the tables, the red wine that bubbled to
the beakers' brim, and the livery of mirth and revel worn
by each cheek, know that the short absence of Bayard
when he conducted Arnyte to his mansion door glowing
with success at the promised preservation of his father,
had devised the dark design of which he was now the
willing yet blinded dupe.Evil stratagems are visited by
the smiles of fortune more than honest endeavoursand
Bayard found both means, time, and persons propitious
to his wish, and not one of these seeming courtiers, who
as a lover wooes the heart of his mistress, sought the
favour
of the Governor, but were the devoted partizans of
Bayard or of the principles which had doomed the death
of Leisler; and to perpetrate the deed they aimed at, no
obstacleno tie sacred or honourable but they would
ruthless of all conscience, at once break down and
destroy
;they
thirsted for the blood of their adversary
so inveterate the rage that nought less than life could
satisfy them,and to such fearful purport, though for the
time disguised, rather than obeisance to their new ruler,
was this concerted meeting and banquet.
The revel of the festive board, the free passage of the
rosy hued goblet, and the gay and cheering discourse of
social happiness, wore on the swift winged hours; each
visage in that apartment shone in gladsome triumph of
mirth and joy, and none could discern beneath the festal
mask the colour of the venomous and deceptive hearts
which were concealed in the bosoms of those wily
revellers
;and
ever and anon, amid the pauses of that
banquet
,
there would burst out from the attendant musicians,
sweet strains of melody,from trump and clarion, viol and
recorder,making the heart bound and leap at their
delicious
clamours, and drowning all discordant thoughts
within
the merry sound; and when the early twilight
proclaimed
the closing day, bright lamps cast down upon the
busy feasters their dazzling rays, and lit the sparkling
wine cups, as the loud song and blithe pledge passed from
lip to lip in fast and pleasant route. In the present
scene, Sloughter lost all remembrance of that which had
passed: the tears of Arnyte were forgotten in the moment
of wassail; none recalled to his recollection the pardon
which he had bound himself by word to grant to Leisler,
and even Jost Stoll, though a guest at the banquet,
reminded
him not of the suffering prisoner; for though the
bright goblet stood on the board by him untasted, yet so
eager did he ply his pencil in draughting the figures at the
festal as they engaged his fancy, that his mind's eye and
ear was as one deaf and blinded to word or thought, that
could divide him from his occupation, and on the gay
group, among whom he sat, he looked with the admiring
eye of a spectator, who views the picture of some master
painter, delighted with every change of place and shadow,
colour and tint that the shifting scene presented to his
vision. The character of colonel Sloughter in most
points, hath been heretofore presented; therefore it will
not be supposed, bred up to the manners and dissipations
of a licentious court, that he was abstemious enough to
withstand the frequent presentation of the wassail bowl;
he was one of those men who in the day of adversity or
sorrow only feel repentance and form solemn
resolutions
,
which as the tide of their fortunes turn, are driven
to the winds, with whose pleasant waftings they are
sailing;awakened conscience, a certain rectitude of
thought which often roused within him, had demanded of
him a reform of manners and of life, and stimulated to
a course that would give his latent and dormant energies
of mind towards the honour and happiness of the
country
which he was called to govern; but he wanted
strength, he lacked firmness, to put in force against
temptation, such resolves as in the moment of reflection
he determined on. An ancient habit, particularly if
dissolute
,
clings to the human system like a snake when he
hath twisted around his wictim; cut the reptile in twain,
the dismembered body will still strive to enfold in death
the conquering antagonist, and perhaps with a last and
fatal stroke, even in the expiring agony in the moment
of defeat, the venomous creeper may attain the victory
and yield its latest breath, well pleased with the ruin it
effected. Often, too often in the progress of that
banquet
,
did the wine cup as it circled round the board, fill
with its potent yet smiling poison, the ready hand of
Sloughterand besides, with many a guileful pledge for
his health, his happiness, and his fortunes, hollow and
empty wishes, which went no further than the formation
of the utterance, did the artful conspirators who were
around him, ply his courtesy with many a recurring
draught, compelling him in pretended friendship, to drain
goblet on goblet, until sense reeled under the influence of
the liquor he had drank, and scarce a faculty remained
over which the powerful grape did not domineer.
Bayard, with looks gleaming in the hope of anticipated
success, marked the vain struggle of Sloughter's
intellect
as reason contended for mastery on its tottering
throne, shaking in its fruitless conflict like a tower
shattered
by the battering of a fierce leaguer. His
mental
darkness fast increased, and he quaffed now floods of
the juice of the vine, until his mind became like a
wandering
bark left astray upon the ocean without a star to
guide its way, and every guard of passion and of temper
was loosened by the excess into which he was plunging
momently deeper and deeper. The wary enemies of
Leisler now deemed the time at hand to push their
intrigue
to the point for which they had schemed, for
colonel Sloughter appeared fit to be worked, as an
helpless
instrument, to their purposesfor such was his
situation, that it seemed as if common discretion had
fled him, and his whole soul had surrendered to the
present
debauchery, like a town whose gates are opened by
a treacherous inmate, to the entrance of the foe.
Hast heard, Mienheer Pell, said Bayard, to the
person
who was seated next to him, and though he spoke
apart as if he meant not the governor to remark what
he discoursed, yet he perceived colonel Sloughter could
not avoid, even in the confusion of the revel, hearing
what he said, and he to whom he had addressed himself
well knew the part set out for him to perform, for he
was the devoted creature of Bayard, and by his
influence
he had been returned as the member of the
colonial
assembly from the county of Westchester; the ready
tool of his master, the character of John Pell of Pelham,
was depicted in his countenancehe was a short stout
man, of rather handsome features, and right bravely
attired
;but
he bore a supercilious cast of visage, with
eyes that sparkled with cunning and deceitthat told
the knave and the hypocrite. Hast heard, Mienheer
Pell, said Bayard, of the gracious mercy that his
excellency
hath been pleased to extend to Jacobus
Leisler
?why
sooth, Mienheer, you look at me in wonder;
know you not that the traitor hath received a full and
free clearance of all crime? he is pardoned by the
governor's
orderor at least, his excellency hath given
promise to such end.
Impossible! you jest, colonel Bayardthe thing
cannot be, quoth Pell in return, as one stricken with
wonder and alarm, pardoned, say you? surely his
excellency
hath never been so rashso heedless, as to
set at large the caged tiger, who wants but freedom, to
spring upon the throat of his benefactor. I say, colonel
Bayard, his excellency can never have done an act so
adverse to his own safety, and that of his government;
he must be unassuredly aware that within but a brief
period
past, the authorities have discovered bloody and
deadly
designs, on the part of the still existing partizans of the
rebel Leisler, which want but his liberation to be put in
force; and these designs threaten not only the
over-throw
of the existing executive, but it hath been
whispered
,
and not I presume, without foundation, that his
life is equally compassed. I do indeed trust, though if I
heard aright from you, the thing is settled by his
excellency
but
if not, that colonel Sloughter will pause, ere
he definitely decides on so unwise a measure.
It is most certain, replied Bayard deceptively,
that in the matter his excellency hath not had chance to
exercise his accustomed prudence and judgment; nor,
Mienheer, for I was present at the scene, and my heart
melted to womanish weakness, could any man, have
withstood being so assailed, the tears, cries and
lamentations
of the young man, who worked on the goodness
and merciful nature of his excellency. And now the
Vol. II. 29
thing is past, as I review it, I am, I must admit,
somewhat
ashamed, to have been so deludedfor I much
doubt me but the stripling Leisler's an artful knave,
and acted a wily and ensnaring partand as you have
intimated, I do somewhat fear me, at the next meeting we
have with the youth, he will have the bared knife at our
throats, demanding submission to his upstart father for
the kindness he recived from his excellency in the gift
of life. I must say it Mienheer Pell, the more I reflect,
the more I misdoubt me of its truth;his excellency
hath not yet placed his name on the pardon. I do most
humbly and fervently pray, he will not do the thing
without considerationthe act may be his ruin.
Colonel BayardMienheer Pell, quoth his
excellency
,
interrupting the converse and struggling for words
against the potency of the wine he had drank, and
although
every other feeling within him was overpowered
by its influence, still a desire for vindication of the
proceeding
which mitigated the sentence of Leisler, shot
like a ray of sunlight through a cloud, upon his
burthened
braincolonel BayardMienheer Pell, said he,
my friends, I will tell youthat is, good sirs, I will
convince youbut you know the boy saved my life
andand the right I'll not dispute with youbut I could
not bring myself to sign the father's death; no matter
while the heart's rejoicing, why strike a melancholy
chord? I drink to you, gentlemenwith this flowing
goblet, I salute ye, sirs. Pell bowed to colonel
Sloughter
as he drained his wine cup, in answer to the
compliment
.
May God preserve your excellency, said Bayard
as the governor drank, and knowing my affection, he
continued, you will surely pardon my pressing this subject
untimely, even at the social board, for I seek of you not to
spare against the counsel of your friends, the life of a
traitor, lest you rue such clemency; revoke the promise
which you have given, I beseech you, and which but
disgraces the firmness and impartial action of your
station
,
and sign instead of the pardon, this, the death
warrant
,
which will release for ever your excellency and
the province of the worst foe you have. It becomes
your excellency to act with decisionlet not then, a
false pity interfere with a correct administration of
justice
;
let not the grave sentence of a court of law, be
a mockerya shallow breath for criminals to laugh at
as a maygame, and not a realitylet it not be a proverb,
that the law hath sentenced, but your excellency hath
made its solemn decree an idle word. If your
excellency
spare the life of Jacob Leisler, it were well you
burn your statutesfor it will not be in consistency
nay, it will be a commission of a crime in your
excellency
,
to visit murther, felonyyea, the worst of
iniquities
that human hand can do, or mind suggest, with the
severity of their appointed punishment. I call on your
excellency for your own honour's sake, to write your
sanction on this warrant, which approves the judgment
of the court against the rebellious traitor Leisler. And
as he spoke, Bayard produced the death warrant, which
he had about him for the occasion. But though the
brain of Sloughter was too much heated and disordered
by his dissipation for a capability of thought or care,
memory or reflection, yet as Bayard presented him the
parchment and he comprehended that which was sought
of him, an involuntary shudder ran through him, and
with a tremulous motion he put aside the band which
offered him the warrant, as awakened somewhat to his
conscious inability of mind, and his unfit state to perform
so serious a duty of his office.
Not now, colonel Bayard, not now, exclaimed he
rapidly, to-morrow I will be more at leisure to hear
and thinkyes, to follow what you advisebut now, the
cheery goblet waits and chides my laggard lip; you
would not have one doom a life away over this wine cup
that which foams within its circlet is of a ruddy hue,
but let it not be bloodbloodbloodthat were a vain
conceitI thirst not for blood, but I pledge ye again and
again, by the bright and glowing bowl.
Bayard perceiving the attempt as yet premature to
induce colonel Sloughter to consent to Leisler's
execution
,
desisted from his persuasion for the time, and
eagerly
,
in spite of his years, by new excess and increased
debauch, endeavoured to drown the governor's few
remaining
senses in utter imbecility, anxious to finish the
work of destruction which had been resolved against
the hated enemy of his party. Nor was he defeated in
his treacherous objectfor besides the conquering bowl
to advance the evil purpose of his wily brain, having by
lascivious converse inflamed the soul and passions of
Sloughter to a callousness of all virtue, he introduced to
aid a completion of his work the loose and wanton presence
of the courtezan, who by the witcheries and spells of
pretended love wound him to their wish, subduing him by
their artful smiles to very bondage. And soon warm and
flushed by wassail and the banquetbewildered by
music
and the voluptuous songs of women, whose sorceries
pervaded every senseentranced to madness by the
deluding
light of sparkling eyes, whose brightness told of
heaven, but in which neither truth nor faith existedbut
shone in beauty and enchantment as the false mirage on
Arabian sands to the thirsting pilgrim, who meets a dreary
waste where he deemed there flowed the cool and lucid
watergiddy with the happiness of the hour, rewarded
by the kiss of a leman, and applauded by the praise of
the rioter, Colonel Sloughter affixed his signature to the
fatal deed which condemned Jacob Leisler to the scaffold,
almost ignorant at the moment of the purport of that
which he had donealthough at another period he would
rather have had the right hand severed from the limb
than it should have guided the pen to the execution of
that instrument. But though after that revel closed, his
midnight rest was troubled, and feverish, and broken
with wild dreams, that started him in fear and horror
from his hot and uncomfortable couch, yet morning's light
that dawned on his sallow cheek and sunken eye, and
aspect worn and sicklied as with care and age, found him
unconscious of the act that he had lent his power to, on
the preceding eveninghe knew not he had signed the
death warrantthough 'mid bright dreams and images of
loveliness, of flowers, garlands, music, rose odours, and
smiles, and all the ravishing brilliance of the past banquet,
there would come vague and gloomy thoughts that floated
like clouds before the face of the bright heavens athwart
his soula heaviness on his hearta damp like death
would rise upon his forehead, and with the melody of
song that stole upon his enraptured memory, there would
mingle that which his chilled spirit construed as a solemn
knell foreboding death or sorrow, and for an instant the
warm current of his blood would chill until he laughed
that which he deemed but folly from him, and his brow
was clear again, and his bosom calm and tranquil in
forgetfulness

BOOK THE FIFTH.
THE CONCLUSION.
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
Romeo and Juliet
.
When
Bayard, accompanied by Arnyte Leisler, quitted
the Governor and Jost Stoll, he proceeded to direct a
horse to be prepared with instant despatch for the
stripling's
use and assistance, and with apparent kindness and
attention, as one endeavouring to do away all former
feelings
of enmity, by his present interest and anxiety to
forward
the youth's impatient wish to hasten to his parent,
he conducted him to the place where the animal was
caparisoning
,
and with his own presence urged his menials
to swiftness in donning the steed's apparel; nevertheless,
while the task of preparation was going forward, at one
time Arnyte remarked a brief absence of his host from
his side, and when he returned, the number of busy
hands employed about the horse was increased, so
that his momentary departure seemed explained by a
desire
of making his kind service keep pace in accordance
to the impetuous urgings of speed from the youth; but
beside the household attendant that had followed him,
there came upon the step of Bayard, four savage looking
men, wild and strange in appearance as in attire. These
were of that race of mixed cast and blood, well known in
the colony by the designation of half breeds, the equal
descendant of the debauchery of the white and the indian,
and inheriting all the evil qualities of the European and
the savage; an idle, loitering, lazy set, the vagabonds of
the settlements, these beings existed by pilfering and
crime alone; leading a wandering life, like the gipsey,
they traversed the province, rioting and wassailing while
in sunshine and health, and when by age, sickness, and
drunkenness, reduced and destitute, they crowded the
werkhuis or the bridewell, or perished and rotted by the
way side. Without a thought or care for the future, the
proceeds of the only labour which the men and women
of this species applied themselves to at any moment,
the making of ozier and wicker baskets, or shooting with
the bow and arrow at halfpence for the delight of gaping
children and boors,were almost as soon as received
expended
in liquor, for which they crowded the open
tippling
houses, which, spite of the law against selling them
such potent poisons, were ever thronged with these
unmindful
and wretched barbarians, and who, when
inebriated
and stripped of their money, were cast forth by
the publican from his house, and left night or day in the
streets or road to slumber and wallow in their loathsome
condition of mind and body, uncared for and unregarded
except by the sportive or brutal tortures inflicted on their
misery by wicked urchins, who, with impunity were
accustomed
to use in such amusement every invention of
cruelty. In every thing these were a distinct people,
equally despised by the red man and the white, and even
scorned by the slave; treacherous, dishonest, and
cowardly
,
they possessed a vile subtleness of nature, and a
disposition for revenge, whose effect was often felt, though
the source scarcely ever to be traced. Many were the
instances related where his long absence had alarmed the
family of some honest colonist, who in the morn had gone
forth in hope, in health and vigor; but whom the searchers
found lying in some lone nook of wood or rock, cold and
stark in death; his face buried in the sand, and in his
back the fatal wound, unknown the hand, untraced the
murderer's foot; some thicket, tangled and pierceless, or
some low wall concealed from his victim the presence of
his enemy, as he skulked to aim the deadly ball; no track
for justice existed, and even had the murdered been
spared, perhaps his remembrance could give no clue for
the wanton attempt at his destruction, for all forgotton
was the spurning blow that drove from his door the
beggar
,
who for years had cherished hate and watched with
lynx-eyed eagerness the chance that might repay the
slight injustice he had received with the heart's blood of
the offender; thus remorseless and capable of every
crime, bought and sold as it were for a glass of liquor,
these losels haunted the farms and houses of the colonist
like a pestilence, scarcely to be driven away by violence;
for regardless of threats, they were often forced to be
tolerated
in fear, hatred, and contempt;and groups of these
creatures, boys and men, squalid with dirt, filth and
idleness
,
were many times to be seen sitting lazily in the
sunshine beside the barn wall, mumbling the fragments
given them by the farmer from the leavings of his meals
who sought for the safety of his farm yard to
propitiate
their gratitude, though warned by experience,
how little of such feeling they possessed. Not alone to
individuals were they a source of continual trouble and
vexation, but many times the means of grievous
inconvenience
to the government; for incited by a desire for
mischief as well as plunder, they would trespass in
hordes on the hunting grounds of the Indians, rob and
fire their wigwams, deserted by their warrior inhabitants
while absent in some expedition in search of game, steal
and destroy their venison and buffalo beef, and commit
such aggressions as to incite the red man on his return,
to a retaliation on the dwellings of the province, which
usually led into bloody broils, alarm and war. Well
knowing the nature and character of these men, and
their sight, as a colonist born, being to him no rare
occurrence
,
Arnyte scarce noted their presence, nor
allowed
a thought to lose itself upon them, deeming their
coming had no incentive but idle curiosity; in sooth,
the mind of the youth was elated beyond all bounds by
the prospect of preservation of life he had attained for
his parent; his spirits were buoyed to their uttermost
pitch, and his whole soul engrossed with happiness so
great, that no other idea could enterso that although
he perceived Bayard ever and anon hold converse in a
suppressed under tone with the half breeds, and their
quick dark cunning eyes ofttime directed on him
with an expression which might have alarmed him, could
he have indulged a suspicion of treachery when his heart
so overflowed with pleasure and hopebut he suffered
not that which could have disturbed him to obtrude upon
his imaginings, and with an unsuspecting and careless
glance, viewed their frequent and secret discourses.
The half breeds with whom Bayard thus bestowed his
attention, had all the looks of craftiness of their race;
their dress were Indian hose and mocassins, a faded blue
petticoat that came half way down the thigh; one had
the Indian blanket, and the others the European
waistcoat
and surtout; they wore earrings in their ears, and
their dark hair was platted and clubbed down their
backs. In their whole apparel, was an odd mixture of
savage life and civilization; on their heads they had
either an Indian cap, or some half worn and tattered hat
that had been bestowed on the wearer, who had
adorned
it with strings of wampum; each had his bow and
arrows
,
his knife, tomahawk, and cruse for water. It was
evident from the satisfaction that beamed in their tawny
features, that they were pleased with the intercourse of
Bayard, and as they stood looking on the engaged
attendants
as they prepared the steed with the careless
and listless attitude of idlers, one of them, as if in search
of some object to break the inaction of his mind, amused
himself by casting in the air a glittering piece of silver,
which he caught as it fell with singular dexterity.
And now the steed he was to mount, was fully
accoutred
and brought forth at Arnyte's behestit was a beautiful
creature, and of a most rare species in the northern
climeof a race imported by Sir Edmund Andross for
his own use, and by him, a scion of the blood was
presented
to his friend and favourite colonel Bayard. The
light, ductile, yet sinewy limbs of the noble quadruped,
looked as if the speed of the winds was in them, and
as the groom led him by the tightened rein, he struggled
fiercely, and champed the bright bit in wrath, shaking
from his mouth gouts of foam which spotted his dark
black hide, like flakes of loose snow caught by the
eaglet's
wing in its alpine flightwith chest thick, panting,
wide spread and smoky nostril, and eyes that rolled
alternate
with fear, like the wild deer at the approach of
man, and then in fire,the gallant animal snorting and
pawing with raging hoof the ground about the place
where he was held, awaited an unwilling slave, and
reluctant
in his thraldom, the will to which he was destined;
and Arnyte's hand was in his flying mane buried deep
and firmlyhis foot was in the stirrup, and the horse
reared, swerved and couched in anger, as if he would
have avoided the power and might which he vainly
battled
againstthe stripling had risen for the leap which
would have borne him to the saddle, and the lip of
Bayard
was busied with smiling and friendly assurance, at
the very moment when a weighty blow from some arm
behind him, descended on the unprotected head of the
unfortunate youth, with an overpowering force and
stunning
violence; his eyes flashedhis sense reeledhis
foot and hand relaxed their holdthe steed started from
him and flung him to the ground.
Nathless, while struggling for mastery with the spirited
charger on which his eye had been fixed, and with thought
filled alone with one unsharing object, on Arnyte, the stroke
that felled him, came as from an unseen sourceyet, as he
dropped beneath its potency, as by instinct, rather than
chance, his eye met that of Bayard, and there sprang forth
for the instant, in its wildness of agony, a look that blazed
of fierce resentful hate and bitter reproach commingling,
while on the ashen features of Bayard sat a grim smile that
savoured
of satisfaction and triumph, as where the tiger gloats
on the powerless throes of the dying and mangled carcass
of his fallen prey after its savage and desperate conflict for
life; but the glance of Arnyte was but momentary, it was like
the last vivid and shooting flash of an expiring lamp ere
it dies in utter darkness, a late start of recurring life ere
it subsides back in death,for there came a hollow rattle
in his throat the exerted struggling of the voicethere
was a slight, short tremor as though the ice was curdling
o'er his heart, and the wandering beam of sight became
dull and hollow, vague and glassy with vacancy,and he
lay prostrate on the earth as an inanimate corpse still,
stirless, strengthless, motionless; for so wanton the
violence
that had been used towards himso stiff, cold and
stark his limbs that one would have deemed, to look
upon
his pallidness, that light had gone from him never
again to revisit nerve or limb; and in truth for a time as
with the piteous fluttering of the wounded bird, who
strives to raise its flight to the elements it loves, with
plumage spread in vain; or as the battling swimmer
gasping to snatch a hold upon some shattered plank, the
fragment of the wreck, but which seems safety in
despair
as now the wave upheaves him within its reach, yet
ere he can seize it, the whelming and deceptive billow
dashes him away again to renew his efforts to attain that
which he had lost,so life sought to resume its lingering
energies; one by one, slow and heavily, as drops that
trickle down the rocky sides of some dank dungeon, his
senses returnedthrob by throb, pulse by pulse the
laggard
beatings of his heart and reins began, and when his
blood reflowed it was with a thrilling and convulsive
pang that shook his dismal trance. What certain lapse of
time the stripling passed in the blackness of that ghastly
insensibility he could not tellyet it was long ere he
recovered
,
and then the first sensation of recurring life was
sicknesshis frame felt chilled, numbed, and deadened,
and his brain was restless and painful and sore with
giddiness
,
and his sight though strained to burst the dense
film that appeared to cover his eyes, was dull and
indistinct
now
it seemed as if there was a passing gleam of
earth, sky and wave that swam swiftly by as with an
arrow's
flight, anon all was wild midnight pierceless and
interminableso light and darkness alternate combatted,
and when wearied and faint with vain efforts, the heavy lids
dropped down upon the blood-shotten orbs to shut out
the confused phantasies that baffled vision, strange and
uncouth noises seemed to ring in his ears, and to hurtle
in his brain; mind, thought and perception appeared
with fruitless endeavour, like the strife of breakers to
o'erleap an impeding crag, to contend for their former
empire
;at
length a sudden shock broke on the gloominess
of the dim and wild uncertaintyfrom whence it came,
or what it was that disenthralled him for the time he had
no conjecturesparks shot like lightning in his eyes,
and an involuntary shriek and start of pain sprang from
his trembling lipshis hollow dream was startled from
his brows, and he gazed around in wonder as one that
wakens from the delirious dozings of a feverstrange
objects met his sight, for he was in a place all to him
unknown
,
whither unfriendly hands had in his deep
lethargy
conveyed him from the spot where he had
suffered
from the treacherous machinations of the irreconcilable
foe of his nameall about him was wild, desolate and
drearabove him rolled the grey and gloomy heavens
frowning and threatening as a thing of wrath, ominous with
brooding tempest. A stormy change since morning had
come upon the face of nature, it seemed as if the bright
host clouds had been but as that gush of joy and hilarity
that is said to herald sorrowfor the sun had lost its light
and drearily the day stole on his altered eye, while the
wan looks of that faded sky betokened the passage of
many
hours since last he had read its gloriesthe wind
howled like a thing of life and searched the forest paths
with its deep and shrill cry of anger and of pain, and even
at the moment of reanimation Arnyte shuddered at its
cold, icy, and death-like touch.
He lay upon the ground in that which seemed a
frightful
dell of some vast solitude, craggy and bare, with many
a bold precipice and cavern dark as death, within whose
recesses the desert wind held sway, and here and there
between the chains of belting rocks grew sturdy trees,
and a wild waste of underwood girt each clump of hardy
oaks, black pine and giant beech as on the dizzy heights
where they had taken root they raised their dark
diminished
headshuge mounds of ice and snow were piled
within the clefts and chasms of the tortuous sweep of hill
and crag that filled the bleak and desert places, and as
terrible as cheerless was each beetling cliff and
overhanging
steep.Bound with many a fearful thong that chafed his
swollen and prisoned limbs the stripling lay stretched upon
the earth in that dismal spotwhile the feeble motion,
when he had regained sensation, that he made to free his
stark members from the bonds that on him were so fastly
tied, discovered to him his desolate situation. Within a
few paces from him was that brave courser whose service
the false Bayard had tendered him in his dissimulation
but now all his late fire and spirit were fled and
quenched
,
and his force failed; for his mane was dripping and
his flank reeking with travel, which judging from his
soiled
hoof had been of weary length, and it appeared as
though descending the gorge of the dell he had sank
beneath
his toilfor with sides heaving as on a rack, and
frame at length o'erspent and fallen to the ground,
immoveable
he washis gallant chest and skin ruffled and
dabbled with blood, his flesh galled and torn by the
pointed
rocks and scattered stone on which he had dropped
while the big round tears stood in his weeping eyes, and
now and then he muttered a feeble moaning sound of pain
that told of hurt severe and incurable, for his heart
laboured
in its deep drawn utterance as though it would
have burst. About the body of the helpless and
prostrate
steed, still were entwined many a broken fragment
of cord, portions of whose parted shreds clung to the form
of Arnyte; for by these, along the horse's back, a
powerless
and insensible prisoner, the youth had been bound,
nor was released until the wearied and drooping animal,
stumbling and staggering with his heavy load, gave way
to toil; for as his feet reeled, and his form writhed in its
last faint effort to uphold itself, the bonds that linked the
stripling to the struggling wretch, were wrenched and
snapped in twain; and luckily, for had the courser's
crushing
weight borne on him, he had not escaped injury.
Arnyte
was throw some distance from the dying creature;
and it was the suddenness and power wherewith he had
thus been cast to earth that had so strangely recalled
life and recollection to him late locked in that fearful
senselessness. About the poor beast watching his
sufferings
,
unable either to extricate him from his peril or
alleviate
his condition, stood three of the half-breeds of
Vol. II. 30
whom mention hath been above made, while a fourth
held by the miserable and broken reins, the horses from
which the accident of the one that had borne their
captive
,
for such Arnyte evidently appeared to be, had, for
the time, caused them to dismount. These animals,
accustomed
to hard service and rough travel all their days,
had not laboured so severely as the gallant charger; the
reason for whose being thus abandoned to the perilous
hands of the half breeds was easily to be divined, in the
supposition that Colonel Bayard, sacrificing every delight
and pride in possessing so fine a creature, for the
important
interest of the moment, had parted with him for the
hasty conveyance of Arnyte from the place where his
presence had for the while counteracted his wishes, and
foiled his immoveable determination of revenge, or
perhaps
as certain a conclusion, while tearing the stripling
away from the scene of actionthat his own savage
object
might meet with no obstacle to hinder its certainty of
execution; the enemy of Leisler had surrendered his
favourite
steed, that its burden might have a swifter
journey
to his last bourne; that by an earlier doom he might
be rid of the influence of one who had proved as
potential
as unexpected an intercessor with Governor
Sloughter
to prevent his evil designs;the horses of the half
breeds were gaunt-limbed, strange and rugged looking
animals, small and clumsy in appearance, with untrimmed,
neglected and bristling manes and tails, and rough and
shaggy hides, the hair of which was long and uneven, and
while their broad chests bespoke uncommon sinew and
strength, their short thick necks were archless and their
heads hung passive and spiritless, and their large eyes
seemed dull, patient and heavy; they were without
caparisons
,
for wretched strips of untanned hide served for
bridles, and the backs of all, except one, which was
covered
with a small, dingy and ragged piece of blanket,
were bare and naked, nor were the riders inconvenienced
by the want of saddles, but were thus accustomed to
bestride
their horses, and when mounted, their own
singular
habiliments did but assort with the wild looking
quadrupeds
that bore them.
A moment's glance sufficed to disclose to young
Leisler
his forlorn and hopeless situation, while at once,
as his eye drank in the dreary and disconsolate
prospect
before him, rude memory, big with care and
sorrow
,
crowded his brain with all the dismal and
unwelcome
images of the past, and imagination, gloomy with
woes to come, excited the mind to very sickness; he
sought not to ask a question, even had he hoped an
answer
from the half breeds, whose piercing gaze ever
and anon was turned upon him, while their dark visages
were shadowed with an ominous and forbidding
expression
his
one glance had told him all, his fear and his
despair; for well did he construe the treachery of
Bayard
;
his aim was not to be mistaken, and the direful
events that must succeed the triumph of his stratagem,
rushed like a flood of burning and searing fire upon his
brain, while his temples throbbed in unison with the agony
of his suffering mind: on his own wretched stress, his
danger, the smart of his wounded brow, lacerated by the
blow that in the moment of his happiness, had blasted at
once, hope, joy, energy, and nearly life itself; on the
lawless and untamed beings, to whose durance he was
abandoned; and the extent of cruelty and persecution,
of which he was the destined victim; on these, scarce
for an instant he bestowed reflection;his father! his
rising heart swelled to his lips in that deep distress with
which the memory crossed him; that parent, whose
safety he had deemed all but assured, who, for the time,
as from the very verge of the grave, had been restored,
had been rescued from sealed death, and that too by the
perseverance and exertions of his grateful child; and yet
that parent, so hardly won, so dearly bought from the
rude clutches of destruction, was again abandonedlost
utterly lost! plunged down deeper than before in the
darksome and yawning gulf, whose shadow he had but
just seemed to have escaped; and then came the bitter
pang, that stuck as with a vulture's fang into the breast,
that blind trusting credulity had aided malice and
deception
to the fearful wreck; and then too came the
enforcement
of the machinations, for whose triumph he had been
betrayed, and the fresh budding shoot of hope blasted as
by a stroke of fire. Awhile he seemed not to see the
gray rocks, rude hills, and forest trees, that with their
frosted heads, like tombless spectres, toppled o'er him;
but there swam in his sight the gloomy dungeon of his
parent, and the pale and waning form of its lonely and
disconsolate inmate; the horrid scaffold too, reeking with
blood, seemed pictured to his heart, and on his brain each
vision the wild madness of despair could conjure up, came
flitting by like clouds that are gathered in the train of a
midnight storm when it musters in wrath; the past, though
dreary, looked not so bleak and cheerless and black as
that to come: it was a long and darksome track, such as
is shown to the fainting traveller's eye by the lightning on
a desert wold; but yet mid all he wept not; no
tear-drop
dimmed his sight, but his eyelids grew hot, like
curtains
of burning fire, and the balls stood unmoved, full
and wide, nor turned to either side in their glassy gaze,
and when excited by the anguish of his mind, forgetful of
bondage, he would strive to start from earth, and twist
and writhe in his bonds until the blood would trickle from
their stretched and tightened clasp, and break his
convulsive
dream; then recalled to reality by the agony of
his wrung limbs, he would give o'er the vain and idle
strife which but increased pain, while as motionless he
sank his contorted muscles, he gave vent to a hollow
groan, whose imperfect tone, broke from his swelling
throat, as it were in utter despondency. And hopeless,
desperate
,
almost breathless and stirring not, he would lie like
some statue overthrown from its base, and stretched in
ruin upon the ground.
This state, however, of horrid doubt and conjecture
of the situation of his father did not long endure, for
now the movements of the half breeds aroused for the
while the stripling from his gloomy and melancholy
train of reflection. It appeared as if they had held a
consultation together on the course which was to be
pursued
after the unfortunate incident that impeded their
farther procedure on the way they had been
journeying
,
but seemingly from the manner of their action, no
definite conclusion had been approached; there was
no hope to them of service from the miserable animal
who was perishing before them, and who, were it
possible
,
untended and unassisted as he was, could he have
survived his numerous bruises and wounds must have
still been useless, from the limbs he had fractured or
broken in his fall, while they were all unwilling to
inconvenience
the horses that remained sound by an
additional
burthen. Amid the interval of their irresolution
an instant decision of the fate of Arnyte was started,
and the dark glances of their fierce eyes that shot
towards the hapless object of their deliberation,
bespoke
the wild and frightful purpose that moved the
relentless
minds of the majority; yet still with one there
was a hesitancy to accede to the full and frightful
measures
that were strenuously urged by his companions, to
rid themselves at once of the trouble of the conveyance
of the stripling from the wild and darksome glen wherein
he now lay, and whose dreary shadows were so near
akin to the deadly deed they planned to perpetrate in its
black recesses; nathless he that dissented seemed the
chief, and somewhat reluctant the rest bowed to his
opinion; however ever and anon striving to shake his
thought and persuade him to join in their intentions. And
now in the broad heavens cloud on cloud folded o'er each
other like a dun mantle, and more bleak and comfortless
grew the weather, and soon a thick small rain filled the
air as with haze, piercing and penetrating to the flesh
through the stoutest garment as with the points of
needles
the
half-breeds dragged their hapless prisoner with
rude and careless violence towards a huge and impending
rock beneath whose imperfect shelter they struck a light
and collecting some pieces of dry wood and leaves that
lay around, soon fanned them in a state of brightness, and
then gathering themselves in a circle about the flame,
regardless
of the situation of their captive, whose being
brought near them was the rather for observance, than for
any warmth or comfort to his sinking frame, and having
drawn forth the tomahawk pipes from their belts, and
filled
them with herbs from their ready pouches, they
began
to smoke as at idle and listless length they lay or sat
before the firewith lip and countenance thoughtful,
taciturn and unsusceptible.
30*
The day waned rapidly, for there was no twilight in
the stormy atmosphere, and quick though laden with mist
and fog the night rolled on, while at its cold approach the
air seemed to increase its chilling temperature; the
half-breeds looked now and then with disturbed gaze
upon
the changes of the heaven, but they spoke not a word,
and again resumed instantly after the momentary glance,
with an aspect of indifference and unconcern their
composed
demeanour as they continued their sedate
employment
,
and it was long ere they broke the silence of
thought wherewith they had enveloped themselvesan
awful and appalling stillness prevailed in that desert dell,
interrupted alone by the now distant and stifled groans of
the dying courser, or the cry of some expectant raven
eager for the repast ere its victim yielded to death as it
flapped its wings in hunger while hovering above the
expiring
wretch, whose flesh was the birds doomed
banquet
.
Piomingo, I dare to advise and speak true though yet
but young, for amid my own people I am not curst with
two mouths to deceive and deny it at the same breath,
said one of the half-breeds after a considerable and
unbroken
period of time had elapsed wiihout the
exchanging
of a word, and ere he spoke he pulled the calumet
from his mouth with a slow and stately motion
Piomingo
,
listen to the counsels of Peter Tawereketthe night
gathers in tempest and we are far from the wigwam of
shelter, it is better we slay the white youth and carry
back his scalp to Claus Bayard, it will delight him more
than, as he bid us, we sold him a slave to the
Utawawas
.
It is not, brother, that I have drunk the liquid
fire of the white man, answered after a moment's pause
the person addressed, but my mother was a
Muhekeneew
,
and the red man's blood is fresh in my veins that
my christian father stirs me not to such evilI would
not shame my Indian race though it looks not on me, by
murdering the boythe life of him who hath injured me
not, it becomes not the descendant of a sachem to take
though for Claus Bayard's gold and rum I have pledged
me to carry him beyond the cabins of the Mahikanders
to the land of the allies of the French Kingand I keep
my pledgePiomingo breaks not his word with white or
red manthough I extend not the belt of peace to either
of them yet Piomingo breaks not his word as he had sworn
by the Great Spiritthe Kitchtau of the Christian and the
IndianI will carry the boy to the hunting ground of the
Utawawas
Piomingo, hearken for once to the counsels of Peter
Tawereket, returned the other, our horses are weak,
and like the branch of oak before the wind they sink
beneath
their labourwe have neither venison nor the strong
liquid to support our traveland it is a moon's journey
to the beaver licks of the Utawawas;let us take the
scalp therefore of the white youth and return to the great
wigwam and receive the promises of Claus Bayardthis
is the counsel of Peter Tawereket.
Listen to me brother, quoth another of the
half-breeds
,
I can tell the white man by his look, though
his voice speak falseI know from the eye of Claus
Bayard, though his words told it not, that the blood of the
white youth will gain more rum and gold from his hand
than if he is spared from our kniveshe would have bid us
tomahawk him, but he did not like to hear the cry of his
bloodbrother let us despatch the boyI hear the wolf
growl as in anger, he seeks his feast for the night, let
us leave him the carcass of the white youth that he follow
not our trail.
Brother, said the other of the half breeds, who was
the least favoured of countenance of all, and assimilated
most in manner, words and look to the colonists, having
mingled many years in their fashion of life, though late
deserting it for the wandering existence of his earliest
youth,it will not grieve Claus Bayard for the fate of
his favourite horse if young Leisler perish with him; and
how easy for our lips the tale of the boy's having been
crushed in the fall; it will sooth the prickings, (if such
there can be,) of Bayard's conscience, and the richer
our reward;brother, let us do the deedspeak but the
word, and this knife shall smoke in the varlet's heart's
blood.
Brothers, replied the leader of the half breeds
firmly, at the same time drawing up his form to its full
height with pride,brothers, I have said it, he shall
receive no harm from our hands; and would you have
me break the truth of my words? Ryner, I have
spoken the boy shall live the slave of the Uttawawas;
Piomingo's word is truth; he will not make it false, for
his mother was a Muhekeneew; and though the half
breed be despised, he will not forget his Indian race;
Piomingo breaks not his word.
The half breeds finding their chief thus inexorable in
his determination against the immediate destruction of
their captive, gave over their attempts at persuasion, and
sullenly replacing their pipes to their lips, remained cold,
reserved, and silent in their discontent, while motionless
they sat, and their forms mingled in the gloominess of the
surrounding scenery, as though they made a part of the
huge fragments of black rock which were shone on by
the uncertain firelight.
The darkness of the night now momently increased,
so that all around seemed girt with one huge and shadowy
forest, through whose masses the eye could not pierce,
though imagination found food to shape many a wild
phantasy; and after an interval, the chief having signified
his design, it was resolved by the half breeds, ere they
proceeded from the place where they were, that they
should await the holding up of the descending haze, and
the rising of the moon, to light their journey, for it was
impossible to make progress in the fog that now reigned;
therefore, they eagerly obeyed the directions of the
leader, in heaping on the flame huge piles of brushwood
that kindled in large volumes of ascending pyres of light,
so that the wild and carnivorous beast of prey, whose
cry and bark ever and anon were heard from afar, might
be scared from intruding on their assemblage, while with
feet to the fire, couched on the wet earth, the half breeds
sought a short repose from the fatigue they had already
undergone, ere the hour propitious for their departure
arrived; nor in their arrangement of rest was the safety
of young Leisler neglected. The stoutest of the band
threw his strong body across the weak frame of the
youth, so that however deep his sleep, the least stir or
motion of the hapless stripling would awake him in
an instant.
There is no one in the living circle of mortality,
however
wedded to affliction,wearied of existence,driven
by misfortune, and reduced in moments of sad despair to
call for the rest of the grave, that calm and unflinching
can face approaching death, and in the hopeless certainty
of mind, can count its sure and rapid steps; strange is it,
that to the boldest,
The weariest and most loathed worldly life,
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature, is a paradise
To what we fear of death.
For what man, pangless, was e'er resigned to meet the
terror of foreboding years,the last, worst, yet
inevitable
throe,the sought, yet shunned when found? for
though at a distance greeted as a friend, dreadful is its
garb when near; for to the most intolerable wo it brings
but an unknown relief, so that even the wretch who hath
no heritage but misery and sorrowwhose days have been
but one long series of disease, pain, and disappointment,
shrinks in the last moment from its embrace, as one that
rushes to enjoyment, and clasps a shadow of his desire:
for hollow is the hope of happiness the grave promises.
The tender infirmities, the resistless throbs of nature
awake at its touch in triumph over the cold calculations
of reason, or the suggestions of religion. Terrible,
horrible is the idea, to be excluded for eternity from the
bright sunbeams and the blessed air,to be as in a night
of slumber, whose duration may be eternal, for whose
waking there seems no dawn!and then that fine,
sensible
motion of existence that wantons within us, to be for
aye extinguished in utter darkness, while the frame that
holds it and delights in its animation, lies down, in an
undistinguished heap of corruption, trodden upon,
spurned, forgotten, scattered like worthless dust into
the airalas! there is nothing soothing to
distempered
thought in the repose of death; the heart
shudders at the last and fearful home of the body
wherein it beats, whether it be the princely vault, with
its rich coffin and floating and emblazoned pall, the
solitary mound with its canopies of rank and yellow
nettles
and long sickly grass, the crowded cemeteries of the
church-yard, with the horrid fruitfulness of its tainted
mould, or the battle-plain, where the ranks of the dead are
blackened in the sun until they decay, or gorge the
ravenous maws of the carrion dogsno, no! there is
nothing welcome in the coming of the grisly monster,
death, let his shape be lovely as it may:the more so,
when the sharp and murderous weapon of ruffians is
bared at the throat, with no power to obstruct or resist
its direful purpose. Heated by the world's wrongs, or
nerved by desperation, reckless and eager the self pointed
sword is sought as the blessing of madness; but dreadful
is it to hear the cold lip of others cater our fate,measure
the duration of life, as it were a matter of no account, a
thing most worthless to the speaker, though the all of
the miserable victim. Fearful in the chamber of pride,
on the lowly cot of the peasant, is death to man; but
far more dreadful is it, when from the sudden and violent
hand of his fellow.
As Arnyte listened to the converse of the half
breeds, in spite of every attempt at resolution, terror
shook his trembling frame to very agony; and on his
dizzy ear the muttered words of his persecutors struck
like blows of might, while his cold brow grew wet with
the beaded dew, and his lips were livid, while the swarthy
features of the half breeds seemed in his distorted vision
to assume the hideous workings of ireful demons;the
very anguish of parting life could not compete with his
distress. With an intense attention he heard the
discussion
,
upon whose issue his destruction pended by a
mere breath; and as it proceeded, his soul was racked at
the preparation of the deed that was to rob him of
existencethe lone and solitary dell his tomb,the
moaning wind his dirge,the mountain eaglet to batten
on his corse; was this to be his doom? were all his
young hopes thus to wither and perish?What though
awhile dark and cheerless had been his road of life,
who could read the future? Fortune might have smiles
in store for to-morrow: to the last moment the
condemned
criminal gives not all up as lost; yea, even his
parent might be preserved, or at least avenged,
pleasure
,
power, and joy might be at hand, like a train of
distant and beautiful forms seen in the passing clouds of a
summer sunset, flitted visions of the time to come, but
never to be realized; another day might give all that he
would desire, but that day he heard was to dawn upon his
grave;the light of to-morrow's sun was to rise upon
his stark and bloody corse, done to death by fierce and
murtherous violence. Indeed, so powerfully were his
feelings wrought upon by the expectation of immediate
death, that when the half breeds concluded their
converse
,
he felt like the convict respited at the scaffold's
foot; and his mind for the moment seemed as it had
received
unhoped for relief.
Accustomed and inured to the mode of life which
often catered less easy couches for their tired limbs than
whereon they were resting, the senses of the half breeds
were soon wrapt in a slumber so deep, and apparently
placid, that even Arnyte envied their unconsciousness.
Although exhausted as he was by mental convulsions,
and fatigued in body, it was no wonder that at times, for
awhile, (brief and momentary as it was,) a drowsiness
that crowded his mind would conquer even his miseries;
and as the heat of the fire struck through his chilled flesh
by degrees, he would drop into a sort of half slumber,
during which he appeared to have a vivid perception of
the place where he was, and of his situation, while the
leading circumstances of life,that which had brought
him to so deplorable a condition, and all connected with
them were lost, as it were in forgetfulness, while the
weight of the brawny savage that lay upon his breast
would crush him, like the riding of the nightmare, and he
would gasp beneath it for breath and life. Little was the
refreshment he received from such rest, and the slightest
motion of the half breed above him would startle him to
awaken; and in the pang, the cold sweat would creep
upon his temples anew, while recollection of his
desperate
state, in the full terror of its reality, would again
rush on his desolate and alarmed mind; then, for an
interval, he would watch the departing storm, as on the
face of the broad sky it faded away, as one that
contemplated
the sudden change of nature from tempest to
calmness, as the last he should ever look upon;and
now fast the mists of the night cleared from the visage of
the dell; and as they departed, momently and fantastically,
they assumed various shapes;now they looked like a
long and solemn train at a funeral, with canopy, pall and
plumes, and mourners that moved with steps that were
noiseless, and looks dejected, wan and downcast;then
they seemed like a crowd of huge pyramids, columns,
towers and battlements, the pomp of some great
metropolis
;
and at last all was disorganized with magical and
rapid tumult, and the yellow and rising moon with a faint
glow of radiance tipped, as with horns of light, the
extremities
of rock and tree, and sparkled mildly on the
fragments of ice, and patches of snow and frost that
seared the ground; the stars too soon began to show
themselves in the heaven, at first white and feeble, but
anon they glittered like morning dew-drops or the jewels
that beprank the dark tresses of an eastern queen.
The sleep of the half breeds still continued unbroken,
and Arnyte listened to their heavy breathings, and looked
on their stirless forms in dread, lest they should awaken
and even move, for their motion might forbode harm to
him. He viewed their slumbers as he would those of a
tiger, the breaking of whose sleep would be punished by
the utter annihilation of the disturber; and when as
hideous they were stretched in the mingled light of the
moon and fire before which they lay, and with the shadow
of the night and rock about them, Arnyte observed the
heaving of a limb, as in dream it changed position with
an involuntary and sudden thrill, which for the moment
stopped the quick palpitation of his heart, he would
regard the disquiet of the half breeds until along silence
allowed his drear and ominous alarm to subside, and
reassured his fear. Thus oppressed with the lead-like
weight of the sinewy ruffian who lay across him, his
brows fevered and hot, and his pulse convulsed by quick
successive throbs, dreadful were the lapses of that sickly
vigil.
After thus having endured a protracted period of
suffering, the attention of Arnyte was suddenly aroused
from his affliction, by the falling of the brushwood with
which the half breeds had heaped their fire; for the
larger pieces having been burnt in twain, the smaller
brands dropt from the flames, and blazing, were scattered
widely around; an ember lighted and of considerable
size, by this incident was thrown so near to Arnyte that
its fire scorched his flesh, and partly singed the cords
which bound his hands together, being stoutly tied about
his wrists;by an effort at once involuntary and desperate,
he increased the injury done the thong, and pursuing his
advantage by pressing it to the glowing cinder, regardless
of the wounds his flesh received from the burning flame,
in an instant the links that had so strongly and harshly
confined him peeled to ashes, and, in part, he was freed
from his thraldom.
After having thus unexpectedly attained liberty for
his hands, the damp of despair, which in the excitation
of the moment had left him, again returned to
overwhelm
his bosom in misery; for what availed his
exertion
?his
loosened limbs gave him no chance of
escape
;he
could not move, but he would arouse a
powerful and unequal enemyand as he looked on the
brawny limbed, and sinewy formed savages around him,
his heart failed within him;though he had thus snapped
his bonds undiscovered it was but a mockery of fortune
that with false hope had shone to plunge him deeper
in his wretchednessit was but an aggravation of his
misery that rendered his fate more severemore bitter
his cup of sorrowwith thoughts thus maddened, his
wild and eager eye ran over the sleeping figures of his
ruthless oppressors, and when he was reduced by sad
reflection
to the very depth of hopelessness, his sight fell
on the girdle of the half-breed whose body rested on his
ownhis knife was bared and carelessly stuck in the
beltthere needed no motion of his form to assist the
Vol. II. 31
grasp with which Arnyte seized itthe bright light of
the fire reddened the blade as he drew it forthwhy
paused he? the weapon he brandished was firm in
handthe savage lay defenceless in his poweran
instant
the load that clogged his breast would be helpless
in deathand an instant's resolution might give the
opportunity
to escape the power of the ruffians to whom
he was captive, or his blood would be bought dearly by
themhe would not die unharmingbut the half-breed
sleptslept on his breast, and Arnyte's soul sickened at the
deed: to liberate him the arm of the stripling must destroy
one who rested on his body like a brother in looks, though
with hostile embracehe must slay one who slumbered on
him silent and unconscioushis heart shrunk within him;
he could not commit that which had semblance to murder,
even though it should save himthe idea was horrid, and
every creeping vein shuddered and froze within him, and
the steel fell from his relaxed hand and with a ringing
rattling noise struck the hard groundthe echo awoke
the half-breed, he stirred, he moved, he started and his
eyes half opened at the soundthat moment was his last,
the youth aware of his danger quicker than thought
regained
the fallen poniard, and nerved with desperate
strength drove it to the heart of the half aroused savage,
and in a moment the dying and the conqueror were
covered by the bubbling life bloodArnyte rolled the body
of the dead from him; the half breed had not even
groaned
in the struggle of parting lifethough his eyes were
wide open and stared forth with glassy lustre, and his teeth
were set together, his hands clenched, and his limbs
contractedyet so quickly had he perished, so sure and
fatal was his death blow, that he had uttered but a single,
stifled, gasping sigh as his spirit departed; Arnyte cut
the cords about his feet and sprang upwards while he
threw a quick and fearful glance upon the companions of
him he had just slainthe fire blazed feebly and
irregular
,
and the light of the moon was flickering and uncertain;
their features were dim and frowning, and their long, lank,
black hair swept confusedly like branches of the cypress
about their breasts and necksArnyte almost fancied
they moved and were about to start upon him, and awhile
unable to depart or withdraw his glance, with a depressing
dread as chained to the spot he gazed upon their dim and
dusky visages, but their sleep was undisturbed.
Arnyte now stooped and took from the dead man
his tomahawk, and mechanically he turned his steps
from the place, reckless of the direction of his flight so he
could avoid the pursuit of the half-breeds, when enraged
they should discover the corpse of their fellow on their
awakeningshrinking in awe and terror from the very
shadows that crowded around him, for to his distorted
fancies they took most hideous shapes and forms
gibbering and mowing like spectres as he passed along, so
that he dared hardly look about him, lest they should
become reality and arrest his progress onwardshe
proceeded
without guide or knowledge of his way;his tread
though rapid was soft and without noise, as though he
feared its sound would betray his course, and his strained
eye was often cast back in searching gaze, while
imagination
painted in every nook the figures of his enemies,
and in the speaking wind their hasty followingnor was
he long deceivedhe heard their cries of mingled horror
and revengetheir shouts, their moans, their curses, and
he saw them close behind panting and toiling in the hot
chace, near, and more near as madly he dragged himself
along the rude and cumbered trackbut yet his
exertions
and fatigue seemed in vain, they gained upon him in
the desperate race, and the wild thought ran riot in his
mind to turn upon his foes and part with life bravely
against the fearful odds that pressed upon him, for no
other course seemed left him; when as he rushed along
his dark and unknown road, he stumbled, impeded by
some heavy obstacle in his route, and abruptly fell
unable
to resist the force of the shock, to the ground, and
his sinking weight bearing against a bank of earth and
loose stone that guarded the entrance of a-gulley, which
ran beyond the dell itself, it gave way and he rolled
down a brief declivity bearing with him in his way
fragments
of rock and heaps of smothering rubbish, ice, snow,
and frozen pieces of bark that the wind had swept to a
mass in the place, until he rested bruised and nearly
senseless upon the brink of the river, which flowed
without
the barrier of forest and rock that bounded the glen,
and from whose dark and crag-enshadowed bosom, it could
not be discerned, as it flowed several feet lower. The
pursuing
half-breeds perceived not the accident, and passed
on, and soon their screams of rage, and cries of determined
murther were lost in the distance,and the night and
silence for a while reigned in the dreary wilderness.
The fresh breeze that careered wantonly above
the murmuring dash of the neighbouring waters, soon
restored the half suspended faculties of Arnyte;but
had his trance been that of death itself, it must have
been broken had it heard the hollow and thrilling yell
as it were of more than mortal agony or wrath that
greeted the astounded ear of the startled stripling a
short space after he had recovered the effect of his
sudden
fall. He had partly raised himself from the earth,
and confident in safety from the brutal ferocity of the
half breeds, leaning on a broken piece of stone that had
accompanied him in his descent from the acclivity above,
he looked forth with an inquiring and scrutinizing eye
that sought avidiously for some object of life and
assistance
in its desolation, upon the broad sheet of wave that
stretched far out in the prospect before him. The shore
was a waste extent of sand, interrupted by masses of
grey stone that had fallen from the precipices above, and
broken sometimes by deep and sinuous bays sinking far
into their rocky hollows, and covered with shadow so
that no light could penetrate their depth; though the
whole wide surface of the water, for at least thirty
yards from the beach, was one solid cake of ice, beyond
which ran the dark and turgid current, the continuous
spray leaping and bounding like a sea monster, in its race
bearing aloft at times some fragment of its frozen wave,
so that the faint moon smiled on the fantastic mass for a
moment, ere by an undulation it would suddenly sink
as swift as it had arisen, like a spectre among the
abyss of waters of which it was the sport. Where the
sight could reach by the lamp of the watery and weary
stars, the land was a crowd of crag, desert and naked
and dismantled forest, that frowned in gloom and
dreariness
,
while the murmurs from the foaming river rolled
through their bare and leafless treesnor sign nor cheer
unto the stripling's gaze of human aid was in that
desolate
and darksome scene of wild and solitude,and faint,
dejected and exhausted, by the labour of wo, travel,
terror and weariness, for a moment he drooped as he
bethought that he had but for a while shunned death
he had escaped the outlaw's ruthless knife, to perish by
more lingering torments, the untended and unassisted
sufferings of overpowered natureand Arnyte with a
dreadful shudder, half closed his eyes, sick with
lassitude
and despair, feeling as if to look around was a
mockery, an exertion fruitless of hopeand deeming,
as he closed his burning eyelids on the bleak view, that
for a while he had shut out a portion of his misery;
and then nearly delirious with pain and wretchedness upon
the clouded and troubled senses of the youth, debarred
the sight of external objects by his darkened ballsthere
would throng for a time in wild and feverish array, dim
and disturbing visions, which, though strange and
indistinct
,
as dreams of the sick when dozing in broken sleep
upon their midnight pillow, would rack his mind and
startle his blood with resistless force; and he was fast
sinking into that dull and misty lethargy of obtuse trance
and suffering that the wounded experience in the lapses
of seeming sleep and waking that follows the recovery
of the death-like swoon that had left its victim amid the
dead of the battle plainwhen first the confused
recollection
of objects pastthe turmoil of conflict of a night
of deaththe smart of pain endured, and the
anticipation
of suffering to commence, are all mingled on the
throbbing though darksome brain; when that wild scream
burst on his aroused hearinghe started, and with
dilated
eye, turned to the direction whence the hideous
cry aroseit was not human voice that formed the
sound; harsh, dissonant and shrill, it resembled the
ferocious
shriek of rage of a fierce and tameless animal.
As Arnyte discerned the cause of that fearful noise, a
sight of horror presented itself to his gazefor a few
31 *
yards distant from him, where the fractured course of
the stream was obstructed by heaps of stone (whose
frosted sides showed how savagely the waves had
struggled
for mastery over its enemy, to which the chill of
winter had fastened it, as one who clings in death to a
foe, tenacious of hate and conquest to the last,) there had
been raised mounds of sand by the chafed and fretted
tide, which having in vain spent its force against the
rocks drove up the hollows formed by its own strength
between these billocks until it made a kind of cove half
wave half swamp, whose flow continued until the
extremity
was lost in the windings of the shore or the
cavities of the line of higher land. This inlet though
navigable
for a canoe in summer, was now choked with snow,
ice and mire. From the further side of the rivulet
came that dismal howl, and thither as the cry was
repeated
,
Arnyte looked. At first, his scrutiny was
mocked
by the intervening rise of sand, but soon his
weakened
sight descried wild shapes moving in rapid and
heedless rout within the shadow of the shore, until
beneath
the very light of the moon, within a stone throw
from him, half on the ice and half on the beach, rushed
the spectacle of fear, a lean, gaunt, and monstrous wolf,
hotly pursued by two of his savage fellows, his equals in
strength, size and hideousness, whose rabid appetites
appeared
avaricious of a taste of his bloody prey, which
(a human body) with his white and sharp fangs and
claws, buried and cranched in his burden, he dragged
along with him as he galloped from the hungry brutes
that followed striving to tear the carcass from him,and
when the pursuers had gained upon him and fastened on
his load, he would snatch the coveted prize from the
struggling jaws of his baffled companions with horrible
growls of rage and triumph, which were answered by
fierce and ferocious yells of disappointment and anger, as
with fresh impulse and spring the furious animals bounded
on the flight of their greedy comrade.
The glance of Arnyte that told his own danger,
recognised in the mangled and bloody thing, for whose
flesh the carnivorous beasts were so eagerly
contending
,
the corpse of the half breed whom his hand had
but a short time before destroyed, in accomplishing his
escape. The terrific sight froze him powerless, and his
life-blood curdled at his heart in horror;he could not
fly, but stood gazing on the bloody spectacle before
him;the foremost wolf, burthened with the lacerated
body, was obliged at length to drop the prey and feed
upon it with his fellows. Arnyte saw them rend limb
from limb, growling with savage gratification the while,
and grappling as they stripped the flesh from the bones
for every mouthful, until their teeth and jaws ran blood
and gore; and ever and anon in their revolting repast, as
they peeled the skin and crunched the bones of the
carcass
,
they would raise their long heads and fiery eyes
towards the silent moon that shone upon their feast, and
howl, bay and yell in fierce defiance at her march along
the pallid heavens, until the hair upon the stripling's
scalp rose on end, in the consciousness of his affright.
Busily engaged at their meal, there had been time for
Arnyte, unobserved by their quick sight, to have fled;
for gloating and gorging on the corpse, at first they would
not have cared to have left it, to follow his flight; but
brief was the duration of their horrid banquet; with
ravenous and rabid appetite, in few minutes they had
devoured every morsel of flesh that had clothed the
bones of the unfortunate half breed; his entrails were
tore forth and dragged in strips and shreds between the
fierce mouths of the ruthless animals;eye and brain ran
forth like water, as their strong teeth crashed the skull
in atoms, and there was left alone a disgusting, formless
heap of bones and blood, that had dropped from their
eager jaws, to tell that which had once been a human
form, endued with the thousand attributes of mortality;
and now the wolves had finished with their prey; so
clean had they picked the skeleton, that scarce a gobbit
remained for the birds of the air, whom the scent of the
gore at the morning light would gather to the spot from
their high eyries in the hills. And still Arnyte had not
stirred one single step from the spot whereat he had first
beheld that loathsome carnival on the dead: there he
remained motionless, scarce like a thing of life and action,
and yet he seemed to watch each horrid movement of
the savage beasts, whose brutal howls rung on the ear of
night, shaking with terror its stillness; but it was with
eyes that looked like stone, and face that was marbled
over with the whiteness of the shroud, while his nostrils
dilated as in deadly pain, and his lower jaw had fallen in
very horror, and his breath came heavy, thick and damp
from his labouring chest, which heaved with convulsive
throes, but of whose violence his stirless form and limbs
appeared to be insensible:there he was; a piece,a
lightning-scathed fragment of rock, cold and frozen unto
very lifelessness, while the thought of all he risked by
inaction and lingering thus until the chance of escape
was passed seemed never to haunt or rouse him from his
stupor; for to his sight the dead corpse of the half breed,
as it was tossed, jerked and torn by the voracious wolves
before him, looked ever and at times to be endued with
horrid animation; and even in the distance and the night,
he seemed to see it raise aloft towards the murderer, its
threatening hand and its eyes unclosed upon him, with a
ghastly stare ere they were forced from their sockets, and
to the last, the fleshless mouth would mow, and gibber,
and chatter with unearthly mockings at him;his senses
reeled in anguish,his brows were hot as bathed with
seething lead, and there were sparks of flame and moats
of blood that swam before his eyes; and there followed
a sudden darkness that covered his sight, as if in death;
his heart panted heavily, and there were strange ringing
sounds within his ears, and his very marrow seemed to
curdle and freeze in his bones;he felt as if he was
sinking in the earth that had opened to receive him in a
yawning abyss.
The hoarse growl of the wolf who now bounded
towards
him, having left the carcass of the half breed,
recalled the youth's departing sensation, and strength and
perception were restored, while the wandering beam of
his eye was fixed on the red and ferocious glance of the
wild and ruthless animal, who sprang with all the savage
haste of unsatiated hunger, whose appetite had been
whetted by his late repast, towards his intended victim.
There was but one of the wild beasts who had
approached
near to the stripling; the others yet lingered, and
were still employed snapping angrily at each other with
their blood-empurpled jaws as they tossed about and
grovelled among the relics of their consumed repast,
as reluctant to desert a bone while a gout of blood
or flesh clung to its nakedness. The wild and flashing
eye of the furious brute no sooner had marked the figure
of the youth in the shadows of the surrounding night,
than with pointed ear and gnashing tusks, and a sharp
yell of ferocious pleasure, he trotted to attack him; and
the first consciousness of the hazard in which he was
placed was awakened in the breast of Arnyte, as the
tameless brute had couched upon his haunches to give
force to the leap wherewith he prepared to pounce upon
his unequal antagonist: to meet with his fainting powers
the assault of his gaunt and unsparing enemy with chance
of successful issue, or to turn and seek safety in swiftness
against the long, sure, and untiring gallop of the sinewy
beast, with his wearied and worn frame, were alike vain
and desperate; and though even against all fearful odds
the conquest of this one adversary were given him, what
would preserve him from the maws of his companions,
who lagged behind him, when they should join in the
pursuit; and then too the pack to which these
stragglers
belonged were in the neighbourhood, for the dismal
howls that by times were repeated with a clearness and
distinct force that belied all echo, bespoke the perils of
an encounter with a vast troop of the rabid animals to be
not unlikely meeting for the fugitive. Yet mustering
himself for a last effort, like the dying swimmer, when
the waves that are dashing about him seem grasping at
him to hold him back from the shore and overwhelm him
in death, he hurled the tomahawk which he had taken
from the girdle of the slain half breed, at his terrific
enemybut with blinded, rash, and uncertain aim; he
awaited not the fate of the blow, but endeavoured to
make his flight, and dashed along the unknown shore; the
hoarse and enraged howl of his brutal foe told how false
had been the course of the weapon, of which he had so
madly deprived himself;onwards he strained with
agonized
strength,the howling beast was behind him,
closer and closer came that horrid yell, and he heard
the very pattering of the wolf upon the hard ground o'er
which, but a minute before, his own foot had fled; the
wretched fugitive with desperate bounds flung himself
forward, but a giant fresh in strength would scarce have
escaped such pursuer; there was no chance to favour
one so enfeebled by his late encounters as the unfortunate
stripling;breathless and panting with useless toil, big
damp drops of fear and exertion started on his aspen
visage, which was livid with the hue of utter despair;
his pace was uncertain and reeling as he strove to stagger
onward, and his step seemed laggard and faint, as
benumbed
and paralyzed by diseasethe ferocious beast was
on him, with a roar maddening to the mind, and stunning
to the earhis sharp claws were fixed upon his garment,
ripping the flesh and starting the blood,the horrid
gore-encrimsoned mouth of the brute hung on his
shoulder, the very breath of the savage animal came on
his cheek like the breeze that bears the plague from the
lazaretto; the wolf had sprung and fastened with tooth
and fang upon the floating dress of Arnyte, his hind paws
remained on the earth; he was dragged along, while his
prey struggled to burst from the threatened bite of his
distended jaws; the fierce and fiery eyes of the beast
blazed with rage at the faint and vain contest to avoid
his hold, and with a ferocity that seemed exhaustless, he
snapped at his victim with his sharp teeth, ere he was well
within their reach
God! cried the desolate and hopeless youth, as he
shrunk from the grasp of his ruthless enemy, while a cry of
horror rose to his trembling and livid lip; and his blood
seemed frozen and congealed at his heart, and his limbs
grew weaker and weaker, and shook beneath him, and he
felt himself sinking to the earth, though striving to the last,
like the wreck of a gallant ship that endeavours to ride the
foam and wave that fast swallows it down in destruction,
with a wild, convulsive effort, to keep back his brutal
assailant
,
as he fell to the earth, nearly unconscious of what
he did, Arnyte thrust forth his hand against the chest
of the ferocious animal, as if in the unprotected member
there was defence against the attack of the gaunt wolf,
like one that would screen himself from an avalanche
that totters above him when too late to retreat from its
impending death:at that moment,that fearful moment
of fate and despair, there was a sound,a loud, quick,
sharp noise; it came to the ear of the youth like the
rolling thunder over the stormy sea to the gasping and
drowning mariner, whom the waves are raging to engulf;
and at the instant, a dark and gory form bounded above
him, spattering him with blood; and a yell that might
have awakened death itself followed; and at the same
time, a cry,a human cry of life and triumph was heard
by the fainting stripling at his side: the first had been
the report of the discharge of a rifle, and the wolf lay
beyond Arnyte wounded to death, still snapping and biting
in his dying agonies against the void and unembodied
air, while amidst the darkness that clouded eye and brain,
young Leisler beheld a figure bending above him; but
when he endeavoured to distinguish it clearer, and to
speak, he could only faintly toss his strengthless frame,
as his voice sank into a low and indistinct mutter, and he
became senseless; every power of his overwrought
body and wearied spirit, exhausted and overcome by his
sufferings.
The swoon in which Arnyte had fallen did not
continue
long, for the person who had thus been the means
of his rescue from such perilous danger, with powerful
force as he would have raised a child, lifted up the almost
lifeless form of young Leisler, and bore it across the ice
to a canoe from which he had landed; and then he
pushed with swift paddle his barque in the middle of the
stream, alarmed by the pursuit of the wolves, the whole
troop of whom the dying screams of their companion had
called around him, and who followed with wild yell and
howl the track of his destroyer, to the very edge of the
water, where they paused and stood in a tumultuous
band, gazing on the pirogue, as it flew like a star along the
river beyond their attack, with furious eyes and dreadful
cries, that sounded like mingled shrieks of rage and baffled
hunger, as their prey was carried from their sight.
His rescuer having bathed brow and temple with the
cold and reviving drops which he snatched from the limpid
waves on which they floated, soon was enabled by careful
tendance, to recall motion to the stark limbs, and saneness
to the bewildered mind of the stripling, although at first it
was with difficulty, that the heavy lids that dropped over
his eyes, nearly blind and visionless from all the terrors
they so late had looked upon, were unclosed, and sight
regained
its force, and his breast, ere it renewed its
healthful
heavings, laboured hard with many a harrowing groan
and painful sigh. And when at length young Leisler
turned to look upon his preserver, an involuntary
exclamation
of surprise and wonder, broke from him in his
astonishment of renewed vision and intellect. The wild
attire and well known features of his devoted Indian
follower
,
who had borne so useful and kind a part in the
escape from Kid and his lawless band from the ruined
forest hut, were revealed to his eyes by the clear and
vivid light of the moon as it fell upon the wave, and the
restless canoe in which they floated. It was the White
Skinned Beaver, that had saved his life in its direst
extremity
.
After the first flow of his grateful feelings had
subsided
somewhat to calmness, Arnyte learnt from the
friendly salvage, in answer to his many eager inquiries,
that after having parted company subsequent to the
miserable overthrow of the Leislerian family, when
Arnyte
had set forth determined to attain admittance to his
father's dungeon and share its miseries, that goaded by
his own fears and the unceasing alarm of the unhappy
mother of the youth, whose disturbed mind and seared
heart, shrunk from the whisperings of her wretchedness,
that foreboded a double bereavement in the destruction of
husband and child, from the continued and delayed
absence
of the stripling, from whom there came no tidings,
he had set forth in search of him. He had traced him
to the Stadthuis, and there for awhile, his pursuit had
ended in doubt; but the lips of all were busied with the
condemnation of Leisler, and the thread of his route
was soon discovered, that had conducted him to the
homestead of colonel Bayard. Here, by an accidental
chance in overhearing a discourse among the menials
who had been present, the red man was informed of the
treacherous conduct of Bayard, and of his now being
carried off in captivity by the half-breeds, whose trail,
without guide or direction, he sought to follow; but in
vain did he endeavour to track their steps; and in
despair
,
as with a late effort, he took to the canoe and
coasted along the shore of the Hudson, in hopes that by
the smooth course of the river, he might the swifter be
carried to some place fortunate for heading their route,
or that he might intercept them, should they cross with
their prisoner to the opposite shore from the
Manahadoes
,
if either of such were their course of journey;
and while proceeding up the broad and turgid stream of
the river of mountains with such intention, he had
happily
been attracted by the hazard of Arnyte, to his
deliverance
,
and to the slaying of the ravenous wolf, whose
claw and fang had so nearly accomplished his fate.
With the very first emotions of joy for his own singular
rescue from harm, there mingled the thought and anxiety
in the breast of Arnyte for his imprisoned parent; for
even to the last, in spite of its improbability, he had
cherished, and yet beguiled himself with a latent hope,
that the malevolence of Bayard, however ungenerous
and villanous, as used against himself, had not been
directed
to the same extent towards his father; and he
sought but with firm endeavour in his own conduct and
life, for a cause or pretext, that the inveterate hate of
the foeman of his house should be urged the more
determinate
and desperate against himself, than against
another person of his race.
No certain information could be given by the Indian, of
that which was sought of him concerning Leisler; though
at the name, he shook his head with mournful motion, and
confessed to the anxious youth, that what was intimated
by report and rumour, such as in his passage through the
crowds of the Stadt in seeking for him he had heard, were
presages of gathering evil that were thickened round his
devoted head like a cloud of arrows, from whose barbed
points there was no shield or defence for asfety. And
Vol. II. 32
while listening to the words of the salvage, the very soul of
Arnyte was excited to frenzy; and with the wild prayers
of one almost maniac, he begged the Indian to exert
the canoe to the utmost speed, that he might reach the
city ere the first dawn of day. The Indian, with redoubled
exertions, replied to the stripling's entreaties, who, at
length, yielding to his weariness and sufferings, was
prevailed
on, after assurances that no effort at swiftness should
be relaxed, to stretch himself on the bottom of the barque,
where, covered by the red man's blanket, he was soon
wrapt in slumbers that refreshened and revived him;
while obedient to the lusty stroke of the paddle, the
canoe
cut the flashing waves, and swam the hissing waters
like a bird breasting the gladsome air.On went the
barque; before its rushing prow, in sparkling crests, the
broken tides ran flashing round; the waters kissed the
little vessel's heaving sides, and dropt upon its deck like
dew the lion shakes from off his flowing mane.
The moon, in pale and midnight glory, looked down upon
their voyage, and its festal radiance lighted the livid flakes
that shot upon the crowned waves with envious pageantry;
on flew the pirouge with a falcon's flight, and the
white foam tossed and raved as it went, like a steed that
battles against the rider it must obey; and on its arrowy
course, wave tumbled after wave, like the wild disorder
of the spears of an armed host in the confusion of the
conflictheadland after headland, darksome glade, lone
crag, and bristling rock, that girdled the shore past which
the barque bounded, faded in its course in deeper gloom,
till far behind they lay in undistinguishable and tintless
masses, covered in mist, night, and darkness. The
Indian
,
with unwearied arm, plied his monotonous task, and
urged his fragile vessel onwards in its course, though ever
and anon, as he drove at his labour, he would bend
himself
with a noiseless motion over the sleeping youth,
watching with anxious gaze his slumber, and as a mother
guards her babe in rest, he would tend with gentle action
to his comfort.
Sleep, wearied one, he chaunted, as he pushed his
canoe along the restless tide, while his voice echoed o'er
the far wave like the soothing breeze that bends the tall
tops of a summer forestSleep, wearied one!
When the red hatchet is buried in the earth,
And the Sachems smoke the calumet of peace,

of the nation are carried
In the Council Wigwam by the squaws,
No breeze wakens them to war
Like the sleep of peace, rest thee, wearied one!
The bird of the Great Spirit, with its purple plume,
Hovers with a song above the blanket
On which rests the brave, who take many scalps in battle;
And the doves that come from the south, the land of souls,
Wing o'er the leafy roof of his wigwam,
To guard his couch from the Evil Spirit and the fierce Huron
Like the brave who take many scalps in battle, rest thee, wearied

Like the damp and sickly vapours,
That bears death to the breast they heat,
And are gathered from the marshy pools of the great swamp,
Are the dark shadows that haunt the dreams of him who walks
The crooked paths his nation know not,
The paths that lead to the lair of the panther;
Like a couch of leaves
In which a serpent hides,
Is the bed of him whose back is to the cries of his people,
Whose tongue is bitter, for his words are false in deceitfulness.

Are as white as the snow flakes that melt
On the ruffled wave of the great lake;

Sweet as the dreams of the warrior,

Ere the weight of his slumbers departed from his
aching brows and Arnyte had collected as it were the
last remains of his strength and spirits, to sustain which
hope had almost deserted him, to look upon that which
he deemed the last unwinding of his woof of wo and
troubles
the
fate of Leisler! A line of golden light, the
advancing herald of the uprising sun, flickered the
eastern
horizon, and was reflected on the dark bosom of the
river o'er which the pirouge laboured, and the top of hill
and crag caught the coming ray, while the mists of night,
in rude and massy folds, like a curtain rolled before the
flood of gorgeous glory, that fast broadened, and
brightened
in the heavens;for a time, the dense cloud lay
like an ocean, whose depths are impierceable, then
sluggishly
and reluctant, as tides flow back from the beach,
it broke away in bands, thinned and faded like the
relics of a battle, until not a wreck of its retreat remained,
and in the day,promontory, steep and river bank,
sweeping
shore and upland precipice, lay clear and plain, basking
and sparkling in the young splendours of the new born
morning; and now the river's course grew wider and
more lordly, deepening as towards a majestic bay, while
the floating blocks of ice, that had many times during the
past night encountered the slight canoe in its voyage,
threatening its destruction, sailed by less often and
hugged
the coves and shores, in whose recesses, like fleets,
huge masses heaved on the water's swelling surface,
blazing and flashing in the sunbeams like gems of price,
and shunning to contest with the stronger current of the
centre stream, o'er which they delayed, until midwinter's
help to spread their triumph.Calm, beautiful, and
magnificent
was the sight of the borders of the river from the
barque, as it bounded merrily onward; here the dark
and frowning forest, its paths choaked with wild
underwood
of every hue, shape and species; its bands of
leafless
and discoloured trees, mournful in autumnal
desolation
,
expanded wide and loftily; now close and
interminable
,
anon opening in fantastic glades, where, although
the view was through a very fretwork of intricate and
interlacing boughs, that mocked ingenuity to disentwine or
to trace, could be caught glimpses of the more open
country
,
vast and uncultivated fields, brown and bare, except
where detached sheets of snow still adhered to the earth in
defiance of wind and sun; there frowned down on the
water's edge, terraces of rock, barren and savage, the
battlements of nature, whose stern ramparts seemed by
the foot of living man never to have been trodden, for
about them was nor sign nor cultivation, that bespoke
their invasion by thing of life;while again, for they
approached
the settlements, perched amid the most
inaccessible
cliffs, was often descried, like the nest of some
mountain
bird, the woodman or the hunter's cabin, rude as the
hill which it crowned, engirdled, and apparently pathless
in its loneliness, with wild crag and tree, the monarch of
the peak, where humanity contended with the wolf and
panther for its dwelling place;close to the brink of the
stream, the dun deer, in undisturbed troops wandered,
bounding gracefully and tossing their branching antlers in
the air, and bending at the passing canoe their large eyes
with an aspect, meek, beautiful, and fearless, as they
looked
on man as a friend rather than an enemy;afar off,
some early and solitary boat was seen making its way upon
the unbridled wave, the forms that guided it, indistinct in
distance, while a white sail, like the wings of a bird, upon
the utmost verge of sky and water, would at times wake
then disappear to the eye; all was a scene to gaze on
in delight, as the rich and vivid tints of sky were
mirrored
in wave, mount, and valley, peradventure unfelt the
cold breeze of a winter morning.
But by Arnyte, unmarked were all the beauties of the
dawn; but one object engrossed his sight and soul, one
overwhelming thought swallowed up all pleasure with dire
misfortune; he gazed not on the magnificence of untutored
nature, for dark and fearful visions of danger and death
swam before his eye, and a sound had broke on his hearing,
mingling with his dreams and startling him from his sleep;
a sound that racked and tortured his listening ear and froze
his heart strings, and stopped the warm courses of his blood
in terror; it was the low, melancholy and dismal tollings
of a bell, a mournful funeral sound, too soon recognized
by the unfortunate youth, as proceeding from the belfry
of the Gereformede Kirk of the city of Nieuw
Amsterdam
,
within sight of whose high and sloping roofs, and tall
chimneys, that clustered like a bundle of shafts, that
ornament
the pillars of a cathedral, the barque that bore
32*
the stripling and his Indian friend rapidly wended;as the
canoe neared the city, more hollow and fearful seemed
the toll of the bell, and although Arnyte well knew it was
the custom of the Court Messenger, whenever any
member
of the Kerk expired, to sound the mournful requiem,
yet the early hour,for funerals were at mid-day; the
stillness which seemed to hover over the town, and the
silence
with which nature itself was embound;for voice
nor hum, nor noise of busy life interfered with that
awful
and tremendous peal of death, at once paralyzed
and appalled him; every stroke of the bell, maddened
his brain, and struck like a dagger to his soul, and from
its solemn echoes his heavy heart foreboded evil and
the direst misery that distracted thought could picture:
he desired eagerly to touch the land and yet feared to
know the worst that might await his arrivaland when
at last the barque struck the shore, he stirred nor moved
not, but as transfixed and bound with horror to his place,
he sat for a time, even as first he had heard that
dreadful
burial note.
The dock, the ways and streets, were deserted
as far as could be seen up their rude and irregular
lines; for in those days upon the road (for being
unpaved
the streets could scarce be otherwise called)
the houses were placed with little care or order, their
porches, abutments and stoebs, jutting out so far, that
each house seemed to vie with the other in the disorder
of its position, so as after the distance of a few yards to wholly
intercept the sight;and besides, as each burgher in
erecting
his mansion, followed at once his own convenience
and taste, in defiance of all rule of civic regulation and
architecture, allowing the nature of the ground its sway,
(it being reserved for the wisdom of modern surveyors
to torture and level to a dead flat plain, a counterpart of
their own brains, a spot whose native beauties were
beyond
compare, until blasted by the unskilful hand of art.)
the gable ends of one cluster of dwellings, were close
in the passage way, while others, owing to a sudden rise
of the ground, (the builder loving the shade of the hills)
were many feet behind it, and having the fronts in a very
different direction, so that the streets were twisted and
turned in their course, with the contortions of a serpent.
A dreadful stillness, save the bell, seemed to rest upon
the whole city. All around was lonely and desolate.
Few or none were seen moving, and those distantly and
in haste, along the deserted ways. It seemed like some
vast hive, whose noisy inhabitants were abroad leaving
none to tenant their vacant homes. One single person,
a maimed and loathsome mendicant, festering in
squalidness
,
and writhing in misery in the rising light of the
sun, put forth his tattered hat for alms with a querulous
muttered benison towards Arnyte, as followed by his
savage companion, he entered the Stadt.
Master, for God's sake, give me a stuyver to get bread,
quoth the lazar, pity me, master, I am old, lame and weak,
and cannot, like you who are in health, drag my limbs to
the kommins, to behold the execution of the traitor Jacobus
Leisler: troth, all the world are at the sight save me.
What ails thee, master? concluded the beggar
abruptly
,
as Arnyte bent himself as stricken by a blow, and
reeled forward, while his visage was of the ashen colour
of the deadand had it not been for the supporting arm
of the Indian, he would have sank unto the ground.
In a moment the force of the shock was pastfor this,
although his heart believed it not, yet his fears foreboded.
He struggled and essayed to speak to the startled
mendicant
,
but his lips failed to frame the question he would
have sought, and he stood all pale and still, with eyes
dilated
and wild, gazing on the affrighted and astounded
lazar, as one that knew not what he did or looked upon.
Why do you linger here Mienheers? the prisoner has
been already taken from the Stadthuis. I heard the
sound of the kettle drums of the Hoofdt-wag that
guard him, as they passed through the city land
poorte. Hasten, or you will lose the sight,
Mienheers
,
exclaimed a voice rapid and sudden in its
utterance
.
It was a burgher who rushed by, and even as
he spoke, his steps died away in the distance which he
hastily traversed. The words caught the ear of
Arnyte
;
a thousand thoughts, such as haunt the breast of
the wretched, though all indistinct and helpless, and
without refuge, yet for the moment, with the force of a
giant upholding the sufferer, rushed through the
stripling's
heart. I will save himhe shall be saved! he
shrieked, and he rushed from the place where he had
been stayed by the mendicant's appeal, with a step so
wild and quick, that the red man could scarce keep pace
with his rapidity. On through the city he passedthe
gate that opened towards the kommins was left behind
himnone obstructed or noticed him, for the soldiers
had quitted their stations, and had followed the crowd to
the scaffold.
Onwards he pushed, careless of the rude and broken
path, on which, at another moment, his footing had
been difficult. Soon crowds of people hurrying to
the horrid spectacle of death, clogged his road. There
were old men, with hair white with age, and eyes
too dim for such a sight as they now thirsted to
encounter; there were tender matrons with their
infants
at their breasts, clinging in love and beauty,
yet eager to gaze upon the death of a fellow
creature
,
as they were bearing their children to some
holiday pageantthere were troops of school-boys let
loose from the desk and form gamboling at heartless sport
as they swelled the herd of spectatorsand the timid
maiden that would at another moment have dropped in
sickness from the lusty arm of love that tended on her
treadthat would have wept at the expiring throes of a
gentle bird, now in gayest garb and visage rich in smiles,
joined the throng impatient to gaze upon a scene of
bloodArnyte broke distractedly through the ranks that
impeded his progress, while those whom he thrust aside
turned on him in anger or sorrow as they recognized the
child of the ill-fated Leislerand now the the kommins
lay before him;it was a beautiful and extended plain
gently descending on the eastern and western sides
towards
the Hudson and the oost vloed, while at the other
extremities rose dark granite rocks and hills, while here
and there along its borders (and now and then a clump
would intrude into the plain itself) grew little forests of
hazle-wood and the ever-green firall the wide plain
was thronged with the multitude whose numbers seemed
fast to increase; every site, knoll, rock, and tree were alive
with human beings, all striving for a nearer approach
to the grim scaffold that rose from amid the dark and
crowded mass of heads that like a tossing sea surrounded
it, like a huge and gloomy spectre.
Arnyte was yet far distant from the fatal spot, and as he
endeavoured to pierce the almost impenetrable barrier of
human bodies that were before him, he grew almost mad
with the murmurs of the crowd through which he strove to
make his way;he laboured and strained until with toil
and exertion the drops of sweat and blood coursed down his
cheeks like water, and his face became black and
convulsed
he
beheld dimly defined forms moving on the
scaffoldthere was one on which his eye rested a
moment
ere it grew dull and dim; he strove to cry outto
shout, that he might delay but for the instant the fatal
preparation, but in vain,his tongue was parched as with
fire and his lips glued in horror, and his heart seemed
as if it were burst in twain.Yet this lasted but a
minute; an age was in that minute! with the frantic
energy of a demoniac he shouted, and his voice rolled
over the crowd, who were in awful silence gazing on the
sad spectacle before them: broke through their
astonished
rankshe sprang to the foot of the dismal scaffold
there was a sudden and hollow sound, and then a groan
cleaved the air, and the stripling's garments were
ensanguined
with his father's blooda cold, electric shiver
ran through his frame, as a gory head, beard and lock,
dripping with the red rain, and eye and lip yet
quivering
quick and convulsive, as in pain and death, flashed
clear and ghastly on his sight; his veins seemed to flood
unto his heart, as his eye met the dreadful object; he
would have shrieked, but it were vain; the imperfect
cry rose to his throatit was choaked in agony; reason
seemed to have fled him, and a blank void was on his
brain; the heads of the crowd grinned, glared and mowed
at him like fiends; all grew confused, and a wild burst of
laughter broke from himit was the very weakness of
his brain;and he fell upon the heaving and headless trunk
that lay before him, whose still gushing veins slaked the
dust with blood.
The executioner's harsh voice was heard above the
sighs of the crowd, that rose like the murmur of many
waters, as he uplifted, with hand buried ruthless in the
dishevelled hair, to the view of the multitude, the
bleeding
and cadaverous head of his victim, exclaiming in a
loud tone,
Lo! the head of Jacobus Leisler! the head of a foul,
disloyal traitor!
An Explanatory Postscript.
It
were not in my nature, most affable and gentle reader, to
leave matters in so melancholious a plight as that wherewith the
aforegoing narration concludeth. Albeit it were a violation of
poetic justice as well as the truth of historie, not to undeceive thee
as to the events in conclusion, which although at the period in fact,
as appears by the death of Leisler, turned out most unfortunate
and dolorous for his descendant,nathless, after recovering from
the shock wherewith it was natural the young man should be
stricken by his parent's dreadful fate, it appears, from my researches
in the chronicles and records of the time, that he carried unto King
William, at Whitehall, a complaint against the false faith of
Governor Sloughter; and although at first, from reasons of state
policy, the king was unwilling to reverse the condemnation and
attainder of the unfortunate man, nathless, he was induced by
Queen Mary, who was greatly pleased with the filial piety of the
stripling, to order the estates of Milbourne and Leisler to be restored
unto their families, as objects of their majesties' mercy; and albeit
at length, through the assiduous endeavours of his son, the act of
attainder was reversed by parliament, and a bill was passed by the
assembly of New-Yorke, on the recommendation of a letter from
the Lord Jersey, by order of the king, levying one thousand
pounds as a remuneration for the expenditures of Leisler in
forwarding
the revolution; and the dead body of the sufferer was
taken up and interred with great pomp, in the old Dutch Church
in the city of New-Yorke. And it is asserted by a veracious
historian
,
that the posterity of Leisler are rather dignified in public
estimation than disgraced, by the fate of their ancestor.
It is not to be supposed that Nicholas Bayard was greatly pleased
at the turn of affairs, relative to the family of his adversary; in
truth, he was so transported with anger thereat, that he violently
opposed the measures of the colonial government, whose feelings
had changed with the times against him, and by his violent and
imprudent proceedings, he became amenable to the very similar
charges to those he had instigated against Leisler; but in his
adversity
he was no way blessed, like his opponent, with the kind
tendance of filial love; seeing when he was condemned for high
treason, under a statute which by his means had been enacted for
the purpose of assisting Leisler's destruction, he sent word upto
his only son, that one thousand pounds would save his life,
cold-hearted person returned for answer,that it was too much
money, and it would make him a beggar, and it was better the
father
should die than the son starve! And it was but by a fortuitous
chance that Nicholas Bayard escaped the rope he so well deserved.
Neither was there an expiation wanting, as historie doth accurately
detail, in the fate of Governor Henry Sloughter, in regard to his
weak conduct towards the Leisler family; for after a short, weak,
and turbulent administration of a few months, he died most
suddenly
:
and some there were, who, recollecting his imbecility in the
affair of Leisler, made no secret of their thoughts, that his mind
was tortured and miserable in his hour of death; and those who
feared or disliked the Bayards, rumoured fearful things, that the
governor came unfairly to his end; and although the surgeons
opened his body, by orders of the council, suspicion was not
silenced
;
his remains were interred in Stuyversant's vault, on the
Bouwerie, next to those of the old Dutch governor of that name;
and although the last hath a pompous epitaph describing his
dignities, which is to be read unto this day, the miserable Sloughter
moulders unremembered, and unwept.
The pirate Kid likewise came to an untimely end, being, after
the commission of many horrid enormities, taken and sent to
England
by Lord Bellamont, the new governor of New-Yorke, and
was there tried for piracy and murder, and being found guilty, he
was executed at Execution dock, in the year 1701.
Thus, friendly peruser, by my means thou hast the sequel of the
fates of the prominent personages of the narrative, concerning
which, if of moment to thy mind, thou wouldst have remained
ignorant but for my labours and investigations thereon; and albeit,
though I take no pride beyond a modest and conscious desert
therefor
,
there seemeth much truth in the maxim of the Dutch poet
and philosopher, who saith
Niemand kan binden den waarhied,
Wie zien niet want heta met wyshied.
Which I have placed in an English version to the following
purpose:
The truth remains in darkest night,
Unless by wisdom brought to light.
