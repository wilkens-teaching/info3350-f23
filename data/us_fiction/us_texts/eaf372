A
I.
The
members of the Monasteryour merry
Monks of the Moonhad accomplished a third
rubber of whist, when it was perceptible that a
general cloud of gravityit would be irreverent
to call it dulnesshad fallen upon the assembly.
Our excellent Father Abbot himself was detected
in a most expansive yawn, showing an extremity
of condition such as had never befallen him before.
We had our Jester, but he failed, in a laboured
effort, to provoke the merriment of the order at
the expense of our venerable head; and we were
fast sinking into that state of collapse, which
betokens
dissolution and departure in social as in
human bodies, when our excellent Father Abbot
startled the brotherhood into sudden vitality, by
an exclamation as unnatural in his case as it was
uncongenial with the faith professed by the
fraternity
.
Abbot
.I am weary of this life, my brethren,
weary of this life!
The Editor
.Does our Reverend Father
design
to commit suicide?
Abbot
.Get thee behind me, Sathanas!
Would'st thou make a wanton paragraph? Do
thy wits wander? Do'st thou deem me a fool, an
absolute ninny, to suppose me capable of thinking
that one may fling off the consciousness of life as if
it were a garmenta thing of wool or linensuch
as thou wearest in the vulgar form of the sacka
habit, which I take leave to say, is as unbecoming
to thy person as it is ungracious in my eyes? Life
is not to be flung off, or its consciousness. It is a
thing to last forever. Change of condition is not
death, whether wrought by the inevitable will, or
by the rash and ridiculous madness of the poor and
imbecile discontent. Of this I had no notion. I
was meditating upon the unprofitableness and
weariness of the present life we lead; of the lack
of variety in our enjoyments; of the eternal same
faces, and of the vexing monotony of thy
newspapers
,
of which the shame and reproach are
particularly
at thy doors; lending thyself and press to
this disgusting scramble after loaves and fishes, on
the part of those who only fill their mouths with
patriotism in the hope of filling them with bread.
Editor
.Verily, Father, thou art right. Our
papers have been but too much filled with this
politician brawling.
Abbot
.To loathing, sirto utter sickness of
heart and stomach! Thou hast thy lesson, let it
be amended hereafter. With the cares of heat
upon usthe apprehensions of diseasethe
pestiferous
perseverance of mosquitoesthe newspapers
should be filled only with soothing and grateful
matters. It is then, especially, the duty of the
A2
Editor to put forth all his strength, summon all
his recruits to his assistance, and win the thoughts
of men from present cares and troubles by the
magic
play of witthe summer flashes of a joyous
lightning that illumines the cloud without
shattering
the house top.
Editor
.Ah! would our holy Father but assist
us in this goodly performance.
Abbot
.Hath he ever withheld himself from
those who were in the condition to need and to
receive
his service? But, with the city deafened by
the eternal and intolerable clang of contending
factions
,
each of which cries with a tongue, the roots
of which are in his abdomen, shall the singing birds
of poesy or philosophy be heard? Preposterous!
Purge ye of that. Let there be a calm, and smooth
waters, that the dove may go forth on her mission,
and proclaim the greenness and the beauty in that
land which ye have but too much labored to defile.
Editor
.We repent, Father. We have
already
made the confession of our sins.
Assolvi;
assolvi!
Abbot
.If thy repentance be sincere, thy sin
is forgiven thee! But for the future, our future as
well as thine, beware how thou offendest after this
fashion. The press is a trust confided to thy hands.
It is not merely that thou should'st furnish
intelligence
of passing events, and advertise the wants
of customers. It is for thee to exercise an
overruling
control even of the advertisements tendered
thee, so that neither vice nor error shall expose
itself for traffic in thy columns. Thou shalt even
make grammar of thy advertisements, no less than
of thy paragraphs, and suffer no scaramouch to
play his antics in thy pages, unconscious of his
own sootiness of aspect, to the annoyance of more
modest neighbors.
Verb. sat!
And now for more
personal matters. As I have said, this life hath
become passing tedious. Even the Monastery
lacks of its usual attractions.
Beauclerk
.Alas! it is even so!
Abbot
.It takes its aspect from the city, and
from the depressed humors of the system, which
are humbled by these excessive heats. The heart
longs for change. Change is the life of nature.
We must vary the prospect. Many a sick man
dies from the monotonous aspects of his chamber.
Give him another room, show him gleams of green
and sunshine from any quarter of the heavens and
the earth, and you give him hopehope, sir, which
lives ever on the refreshing resources of change.
We must seek this change for ourselves. We are
all sick;thou no less than the rest. There is a
greenness about thine eyes which tends to jaundice
mine. The tongues of the Club are drowsy.
Thou
hast written no pleasant paragraph for a week or
more, and Pictor has abandoned his easel. I mark
ye, all, that ye drink more deeply of your claret,
and your voices and brains seem to thicken
accordingly
.
We must go abroad: we must wander
all who maythat our winter evenings may be
made pleasant by draughts upon the grateful
memory
of our summer rambles.
Pictor
.But whither, father?
Abbot
.Ah! Pictor, already thy fancy rises;
thy imagination begins to spread her wings. Thou
A3
art thinking of the mountains of Saluda, of the
Apalachian ranges, of the stupendous glories of the
Tzelica, which the vulgar persist in calling the
French Broad, because of the rude hunter, French,
who, looking after Bear and other varmint,
crossed the great back bone of the country, and
stumbled upon its surpassing waters. Thou
would'st fly, now, to Csar's Head, and to the
Hickory Nut Gap; to tbe Table Mountain; to
Tallulah, and to Toccoah! Season thy patience
for awhile, my son. Thou shalt visit these
favorite
realms of sun and shadow, of temple and
devotion
,
at the proper opportunity, but our present
purpose contemplates not the interior. I would
conduct thee to views along the great plain of
ocean, rather than the wild ranges of rock and
mountain. I would conduct ye to the finest
watering
place in all Americato one of the most
glorious beach-drives that we may boast; where
thou may'st daily behold the worshipping waters
of the Atlantic, either subdued and sleeping at thy
feet, or rising, rolling, revelling, or raging, in the
wildest antics, for the surprise of thy fancy, or the
excitement of thy imagination.
All
.Where? Holy Father! Where is the
delicious spot from whence we may behold these
things? Long Island, Rockaway, Nahant!
Abbot
.Pshaw! Yankee Humbugs, all!
with which our poor nincompoops, who find
nothing
good or beautiful but the foreign, have been
deluding themselves for the last hundred years.
Something nearer home, my children; more easy
of accessmore worthy, as well of our love, as
our admiration. There, with the ocean opening
its wide gates of foam, for a thousand leagues
before
us on the one hand, shall we turn upon the
other to behold green islets, whose grassy slopes
and wooded crests stoop to the brink of the sunny
billows. We shall see smiling villages crowning
the modest heights, the smooth waters of a bay
scarcely less lovely than any we may name, its
entrance strongly watched by frowning fortresses,
which lie grimly waiting for the enemy, in a
vigilance
which never shuts the eye; and, beyond, a
gay city with her daily rising spires, which seem
to spring out from the ample bosom of the great
sea itself. What would you more? Is not this a
subject for your pencil, Pictor? Is not this a
theme better fitted for your columns, Master
Editor
,
than the cry of young and old ravens, equally
clamorous with the chorus of the daughter of the
horse leechGive! Give!
Beauclerk
.But whither, Father; where is
this scene of which you speak? Where do you
mean to take us?
Abbot
.Ah! you are all agog with curiosity.
The charm works. The drowsiness hath left your
eyelids, and the claret remains untasted in the
goblets
of Pictor and Beauclerk. Drink, children,
that ye may have strength for the revelation. It
will surprise you yet more.
Io so che avete sete,
perci bevete!
You will feel better after it.
All
.We obeyand now.
Abbot
.Can you not guess?
All
.We have tried: No.
Abbot
, (solemnly.)My children, such of ye as
may, will leave with me in the last boat to-morrow
afternoon for Sullivan's Island.
A4
II.
Omnes
.To SullSulliSullivan's Island,
Father
?
Abbot
.Ye seem confounded, my children!
Beauclerk
.And well we may be, Father.
Who, till now, ever heard that Sullivan's Island
was a place of so many attractions? Here have
we been living, man and boy, for a matter of near
two hundred years, and it is now, for the first time,
that we hear the place spoken of as one possessing
such superlative beauties.
Abbot
.You mistake, Beauclerk! When we
were a people of simple pursuits, and of a more
manly and less dependent nature, it was greatly
valued because of these very beauties. The grant
which confers upon every citizen the right to build
his wigwam upon Sullivan's Island, free of charge
for land, was based upon its notorious attractions
to the City, to which, indeed, it was conceived a
place of prime necessity.
Beauclerk
.For health, I grant you.
Abbot
.Dost grant me, hedgehog? Well,
and what is health, but the great essential of
happiness
;
and upon what plea do our people fly
northward with the summer, but that they seek
for the securities of health? But the enjoyment
of health necessarily implies comfort, though I am
not satisfied to base my argument in behalf of
Sullivan's
Island upon its salubrity alone. I repeat
the challenge, that ye will name to me a nobler
beuch, a broader empire of sea prospect, upon
which the eye may wander, sweeter, cooler, or
more cherishing breezes, or a prospect within the
harbor, of more becoming loveliness?
Editor
.But, Father, the unmitigated heat, the
blazing sun at noon-dayno trees, no shade!
Abbot
.It is because ye live like vegetables
rather than like men, when ye get there, that ye
suffer from the heat! Do ye feel the sun when
fishing, under an ample awning, with your anchor
dropt just on the edge of Drunken Dick, and the
billows lifting your bark, with a swell of breezes
that come all the way from Cuba to fan your
cheeks?
Pictor
.Warmed moderately, and gratefully
perfumed, with the sighs of the Cuban damsels.
Abbot
.Precisely! The imagination of Pictor
begins to glow. But, in truth, it is the stagnation,
and not the heat, from which you suffer on
Sullivan's
Island. The heat is not a whit greater there
than I have found it at noon-day, in the same
season
,
at Saratoga and Long-Island; and the
evenings
are far lovelier and more refreshing. But,
remember, I am not now speaking of what art has
done, or may do, to make Sullivan's Island perfect
as a place of summer resort. The houses are
calculated
rather against sudden tempest, than with
regard to human comfort. Their plans, if indeed
they ever were planned, are as wretchedly
unsuited
to the scene and situation, as if they had been
tumbled out of rolling clouds. We should borrow
for such a situation, the plans of the people of
Bagdad. The oriental style of courts, should be
coupled with our verandahs, securing us shade
always
.
A5
Light moresco wings should enclose a
central space, where we may rear shade and shrub
trees, and find fragrance and shelter from the same
sources. There is some talk of a fine hotel for the
Island. Make it as fine as you please, but, above
all, let it be suitable to the place and the season.
Give it a noble court. Cover with it three sides
of an open square, with a colonnade compassing
the entire front, and a basement which would be
cool always, spanned by ample arches. The
buildings within the Fort are somewhat on this
plan:let the architect improve upon them.
Editor
.All this is very good, Reverend
Father
;
and no one doubts that art can so perform its
offices, with nature, as to supply many of her
defects
.
But I confess to a surprise, with the rest
of the brotherhood, that, all on a sudden, our Island
should be discovered to be a place of such
admirable
natural superiority. Now, I may claim to be
tolerably familiar with it.
Abbot
.Pshaw!shooting curlews when you
had nothing but the birds in eye and mind; or
going
down to a dinner party, when the great
essential
object of thought was C's wit, and C's
champagne! On such occasions, let me tell you,
men never look out for the beauties of a region.
In fact, no man looks to make a discovery, unless
first satisfied that a discovery is to be made. We
undertake the search after neither a truth nor a
beauty, unless first assured that they are in
existence
.
This is a law of nature, requiring that the
medium of search should first be in the mind, before
the object ever grows up before the eye. Now,
the very fact that you have never heard of the
resources
of Sullivan's Island, except as a place of
health, is conclusive with you that it possesses
none. It is thus that a man too frequently lives
only in his great grandmother, and if she died
without
having known the virtues in a melon, he will
be apt to grow up in the perfect conviction that a
melon is nothing better than a squash.
Editor
.Your zeal, Father, may make you
eloquent, but not conclusive. Your sarcasm
applies
too generally, to fall with force upon any.
Unhappily, the opinions which I have expressed,
are universal with the brotherhood.
Abbot
.Why not addwith the whole City?
Editor
.And so I may!
Abbot
.Ay, and so you may, and with
propriety
.
A people who have done nothing but look
abroad, and live abroad, all their lives, will be the
last people to see anything worth looking at in
their own provinces. Indeed, their justification
for absenteeism depends entirely upon their
assertion
touching the deficiencies of home. What
Irish nobleman or landowner, living in Italy, will
admit any attractions in Ireland, except his rents?
But, in arguing from our previous refusal to
acknowledge
the
home
attractions, in point of place
and climate, you must go further. We happen
not only to refuse our faith to the place, but to the
persons. We do not believe in one another, my
children.
Pictor
.Fie, Father! Has our brotherhood
done nothing to repair this evil? Was not our
blessed and beloved order, the Monks of the
Moon, created especially to teach this faith in
one another.
Abbot
.And what if we have done something
towards it? Does this make against my
argument
?
Enough, that the want of faith in the
virtues
of the race,
was
the pregnant deficiency of the
community. It is still so to a most lamentable
degree; and your questioning in regard to what
has been alleged in behalf of the attractions of our
Island, is simply illustrative of our pernicious local
habit in every respect. You all persist in refusing
to see the thing as it is. You refer me
perpetually
to the past. When I say, look at the
loveliness
of this harboragelook at at the green shores
which gird it inbehold the proud fortresses
which dignify and defend itsee the noble City,
with its spires, rising, almost like another Venice,
from the bosom of the deep; and see, where, at the
very entrance to this beautiful region, lies an Islet
by the sea, its broad, hard, sandy beach, glittering
in the moonlight, and the glad waters subsiding to
a musical rest upon its gently sloping shores:
when I have said and shown all this, what do you
answer? Whythat your grandmothers lived
here a thousand years, and never, in all that time,
thought these things worth looking at.
Beauclerk
.Ahem! Father, my
grandmother
was an honest woman.
Abbot
.God bless her! Let her rest! We
have not summoned her. Be not offended, my
children. Ye are still in the shadows and depths
of the valley of ignoranceye are still steeped to
the lips in the waters of prejudice and a narrow
vanityye labor still under certain infirmities
common to our city. Let us cure these infirmities
if we canlet us couch this blindness if it be
possible
and
let us first begin, by dismissing from our
lips those stereotyped laws of a very dull and
purposeless
convention, which have been ruling us
too long. Our infirmity has grown out of too
rapidly
acquired affluence, under circumstance which
can scarcely happen again, unless perhaps, in
California
.
It may be, that, sixty years from the
present
time, there shall be on the waters of the Gila,
a pet community. These shall constitute what
will be called there the aristocracy. They will
dine from plates of goldthey will revel in halls
of marblethey will marry only among one
another
;
and they will be acknowledged as the lords
of the land. Your grandson will probably
discover
,
among these people, the grandchildren of
persons
,
who, in the old States, were not held worthy
to unloose the latchets of your shoes. Yet, on the
Gila, what airs will they take on! How they will
swagger! They will realise a common history;
they will despise the region where their fathers
made their fortunes, and from which they still draw
their resources: they will curse it by absenteeism;
they will see nothing of its attractions; and will
turn up their puppy noses at every argument
which goes to show the treasures of their own
homes. My children, we cannot well cure this
disease in persons who are far gone with it. But,
if possible, let us keep these people, the younger
generations, from being inoculated. Now, I give
you too propositions to chew upon. They involve
the horns of a dilemma. A region will always
represent
its race: they will take their tone and
coloring
from its elemental aspects; they will be
fashioned morally and mentally by its climate and
its necessities; they will suit no other half so well.
The other is like unto it. No individual is
superior
to his race. He is, perhaps, never more
distinguished
than when he represents the highest
condition
of its character and intellect. Very few do
this. He, therefore, who believes neither in his
place, nor in his race, is the worst of infidelsa
besotted
onean ass that never sees his own ears
which I take to be the worst sign in the condition
of such a beast. But is Pictor asleep?
Pictor
.Only absorbed, father!
Qual ne' tuoi dtti
Magia s' asconde
.
Abbot
.No blarney, Belial! Enough, that we
both know who talks well. Why need we
advertise
unnecessary knowledge?
Editor
,
(suddenly waking.)
Advertise, did
you say? Eh! Ah! Proceed, good Father, I
hearI listen.
Abbot
.What a heathen Greek it is! But I
will not be confounded. I will proceed; for, in
truth, I have something more to say.
Beauclerk
,
(aside.)
When had he not?
Abbot
.And now, my children, let me remind
you of what the Germans tell us of the open
secret
.
It is that secret which lies at the feet of
every man; but which, by reason of his own blind
follies, vanities, or prejudices, he can never be
made to see. The bounty of God leaves no man
without his treasure, would he only stoop to pick
it up. Every land, in turn, has its own resources
of wealth and beauty; nay, of enchantments; fairy
climes, weird wonders, and spoils of magic,
precisely
as it hath resources of soil and fruitage.
These, indeed, are its moral fruitage, which a race
possesses only in degree with the exercise of its
faith and courage. In the resources of the race,
there is no stint of the individual. There is a
wealth for each, in turn; but it can belong to him
only who seeks to find it. The successful search
naturally depends upon the conviction that we feel
that the thing sought for
is in existence
. To him
who searches with this proper faith, there are
discoveries
at every footstep. Hills that seem barren
on the outside, have wondrous metals and minerals
within. Rocks that frown in granitic grandeur,
but strike them with the right hand and hammer,
and they open straightway, and reveal beneath, the
wondrous loveliness of articulate and living
marble
.
Trees that bear no fruit to the eye, have yet
strange, sweet singing birds, that harbor in their
branches; and the dull clod, the seemingly
unconscious
plain of prairie, under the proper stroke of
the wand, discovers the secret currents of pure and
refreshing waters. But there must be a divining
rod for the revelation of treasures. They
belong only to those whom the
slaves
of the
lamp
and ring
declare themselves willing to obey.
These find avenues among the hills, paths through
the interminable thickets, forms of beauty in the
cavernous rocks, and voices of rare melody in
otherwise silent birds. These are your magicians.
They possess what we may call, The Home
Secret
.
These are the Genii of Art and Labor,
who consecrate themselves to
place;
and unless
these discover The Home Secret for a people,
the race, after a certain period of gestation, must
die out, failing their mission, like herbage that
never reaches seed time. Such men constitute the
genius of the nation. They are the first to
discover
what a people are, what they need, and what
they may become. In short, they lay hands upon
and develope the secrets of a country;and every
country has certain secrets peculiar to itself. For
them, only, does Isis, the great Mother of
Mysteries
,
remove her veil, and without falsifying the
inscription on her shrine. They are
not
mortal.
They sound the fathomless, they trace the
pathless
,
they gather from all systems the blessings and
the light, and preserve them for the benefit of one.
And all this, my children,
only because they look at
home!
It is in the very humbleness of their seach
that they make their discoveries. Tell the vulgar
man of morbid self-esteem, of some great wonder
passing before him, and he elevates his eyes, and
pitches his vision to the farthest possible point
within his horizon; and all the while the great
spectacle is passing at his very feet. The
difference
between the great and the little man is in
nothing
more remarkable than this. The former
makes himself the master of his provinces; the
latter seeks for servitude in the provinces of other
masters. The mental forage of the one, can only
be furnished in foreign pastures. He turns up his
nose, with a nice antipathy, at the thing which
grows beside his own doors. It is the noble duty
of the other, which springs from an unselfish love
perhaps, in some degree, from an inevitable
destiny
to
labor ever in its proper cultivation. It is
his pleasure to draw the novel from the familiar,
the precious from the cheap, the rare from the
common, the ideal from the actual. And these, by
the way, are the greatest of all studiesthe
studies
of the great in every age.
Editor
.How little does the common mind
understand this, particularly in the development
of home treasures. Mere egotism and vanity,
certainly
,
never find anything at home but themselves.
How often have I heard the small author, in
America
,
disparaging native art.
Pictor
.Ay, and how often have I heard the
native artist aver that he could never tolerate an
American book.
Abbot
.This is the weakness of persons, who,
having acquired some position themselves,
respectively
,
in their professions, presume in judgment,
and claim a right to preside, as oracles, before
they have earned the right, which sympathy alone
can impart, to ask an audience. Their self-esteem
blinds them to the fact, that such avowals of
opinion
are fatal to none more than to themselves. If
the race is competent in one department, why not
in another? If wanting in a literature or an art,
why not in all? If not unendowed in one,
demanding
the same requisites of taste, fancy,
imagination
and thought, why should they be wanting
in any province, which demands the exercise of
B
these agents? But the notion is an impertinence,
as surely as it is an absurdity. The Providence
of God leaves no nation utterly without the means,
not only of its extrication and deliverance, but of
its high moral and intellectual triumphs. The
seeds of glory as well as life, are thickset in every
land. There might have been poets, and artists,
and philosophers, among the savage tribes of
Apalachy
and the Rocky Mountains, great as ever
were produced among the fairest of the Caucasian
tribes, had they taken the first step in the
discovery
of The Home Secret. But here was their
difficulty, at their very threshholdthey had no
homes. The history of a national progress to
civilization
may be comprised in few words. The
first step is to make a people
stationary
. Slavery
seems to be the only process for effecting this.
To be stationary, labor becomes inevitable, as the
habitual law of life. Labor begets thought,
training
,
method, morality and art, finally. These, in
turn, beget the spiritual tendencies. From these
come all the higher aims of the intellectual and
religious nature.
Editor
.Ah! but that first step! What a
courage is implied in the voluntary assumption of
the tasks of labor. One would think it necessary
that a race should first be favored with an inspired
mana prophet as well as a master.
Abbot
.And such is the master. The master
of the Lamp and Ring, is endowed, no doubt, for
his mission, if he be not false, like Balaam, to his
duty. He must show to the nation what is lying
at its feet, declare the uses of its own hands,
unscale
the domestic vision. There is a moral, no
less than a physical near-sightedness, which is one
of the prime sources of a national genius. There
is nothing so sectional, so exclusive, as genius.
How Homer subjected the possessions of the
world, to illustrate and make glorious his own
tribes of island fishermen. How Shakspeare makes
English every thing that he touches! What tributes
have Burns and Scott drawn from the surrounding
nations, with which to crown with verdure the
bald, bleak hills of their own petty domain! And
how natural that this should be so! Our
affections
and sympathies are of little use, scattered
over all the dominions of mankind. We better
prove our sympathies with the rest, when we
attach
ourselves to one of its sections, and expend
our strength, our art, our affection upon that. Let
the
Genius Loci
do thus always, and what region
will remain without its tutelary god and crowning
altars! It is in this very moral near-sightedness
that we find the seeds of all true patriotism; all
other is counterfeit and hollow. Without the
representative
genius which possesses it, and which
asserts the right of a people to position, one race
is simply the shadow of another. It is servile
because
purposelessthe creature of a foreign
enemy
,
feeble with all it numbers, and flinging its
misdirected arms in air, while its head is down,
muffled, beneath the arms of a superior.
Pictor
.Beauclerk sleeps, Father.
Abbot
.Ah! I see! You have my
benediction
!
Remember, we depart to-morrow by the
last boat.
Au revoir!
B2
III.
Omnes
.Welcome, Father, you are just in
season
.
It is the last bell which you hear.
Abbot
.As it should be, my children. I am
never late, but love not to be too soon. Ha! who
is this? our Poet, our Lopez de Vega? Whence
come you, my son? Whither have you been?
Poet
.To Georgia, Father.
Abbot
.What, Rowland Springs?
Poet
.No, indeed! I remembered too well
your favorite maxim, never to go where all the
world goes; in particular, to those places where
we see little besides our own people. I have been
on a visit to the wild placesthe mountains, the
rocks, the waterfalls, the Currahee, Tallulah,
Toccoah.
Abbot
.Ah, dog! But there rests against
your name, in the records of the Monastery, a fine
of a dozen of Champagne. You went without
leave, after your usual fashion: without beat of
drum; selfishly seeking pleasures which you were
not disposed to share with your brethren. For
my part, I can enjoy no pleasure unless I share it.
I see but a small part of the beauties of the
landscape
,
unless some dear one is nigh to partake my
delight.
Poet
.And it was with this very feeling,
Father
,
that I went alone. I shall report their
beauties
and delights hereafter. Too much company
spoils for me the charms of the prospect. There
will be always some blockhead to cry aloud, at
the moment when you are bathing in rapture
What a glorious prospect! Such people
distress
and sicken me. I seek to feed, and in
silence
to
feed the soul through the medium of the
eyeand, at such periods, I care not to listen to
the buz of human voices. I would hear no
sounds save those which are properly kindred
with the scene: the voice of the torrent, or
perhaps
of some grey eagle or lordly vulture, as he
sweeps in mighty circles, and screams in unison
with the hoarse roar of shrieking waters.
Feeding
thus alone, my digestion is always good.
The thoughts and fancies which I then enjoy are
taken into the system, and become
fused
, as it
were, with all the natural faculties. In after days
they find utterance as a part, not simply of the
scenery, but of myself. It is thus, and then, that
I share all my delights with my brethren. I give
them no crude exclamations. I give them the
symmetrical conceptionthe full conclusion---the
perfect wholeness of the prospectwith enough
of
myself
, to enable them to determine to whom
they should be grateful. To have them with me
when I am studying my picture, is to endanger its
propriety and symmetry. Their exclamations at
such moments are as ungracious and intrusive as
the interruptions, by the vulgar and pretending, of
the favorite strain of music, breaking the
symmetry
of its finest parts, under the impudent plea of
declaring their delight, and applauding the
performer
.
Abbot
.You are ingenious and subtle, as
usual
contriving to rebuke your neighbor in defending
B3
yourself. But do you class your fellows of the
Monastery with the vulgar who are guilty of such
monstrosities as those you describe? Do you
hold us to be people of that order, who
perpetually
demand your opinions of what you see, and
challenge your admiration of the things they affect
to admire? Do we not all know what a fine and
unusual prospect demands? Do we not know
that nothing is more gradual in growth than the
capacity for judging of the new and unfamiliar?
Who sees all the charms of a picture, where the
picture has anything in it, at a first glance? We
must wait until our standards grow, as they do
always if we give them time, from the survey of
the scene itself; and nothing is more vexing or
impertinent than the vulgar challenge: Is'nt that
beautiful? from people who can scarcely tell an
eagle from a cow, and know no more of poetry
than a donkey. Verily, my son, your offence is
great, if you confound the children of our beloved
order with such miserable cattle.
Poet
.It were a great sin, Father, were I
guilty
of this offence. I spoke in generals only. I
have had the brotherhood gratefully in mind,
during
all my journey. It was to prepare the way
for them, to make myself familiar with the
terra
incognita
, that I might be useful in their guidance,
that I went first alone. It was the first suggestion
to our Brother, the Editor, upon my return last
evening, that we should all visit together, the
scenes which I have been compassing; for verily,
Father, they well deserve the regards of our
blessed order. In particular, Father, they appeal
to
thee!
They will refresh thy fancies, they will
stimulate thy imagination, they will fill thy mouth
with good things, and thy youth will be renewed
like that of an eagle, when he has bathed his
pinions
in the fountains of the Sun!
Abbot
.Thou amendest thy error, child! We
will think of this tour of survey which thou
counsellest
.
It may meetly follow after our return from
Sullivan's. They tell me much of these wild
regions
of our sister State. They speak of Tallulah
as being a scene of great magnificence.
Poet
.Equal, in most respects, to Niagara,
Father.
Abbot
.Ha!
Poet
.More various and wild, full of beauties
which Niagara does not possess, and of a
grandeur
little short of the awful glory, which is the
charm and wonder of that great world-cataract.
Abbot
.Toccoah?
Poet
.Beautiful as a virgin's first dream of
love. Beautiful as a nymph gazing into the
maternal
fountain.
Abbot
.Son, we shall go thither on our return.
But our boat is underweigh. Let us get to the
bows. I like ever the forward prospect.
Editor
.We owe much, Father, to Master
Hillard, by whose enterprise frequent boats ply
between the city, the island, and other places. He
hath opened the way to Haddrell's Point.
Abbot
.Drop the Point, I prithee! Why
cumber the language unnecessarily? The place
should be called Haddrell only. It is a good
name,sounding, without being affected or petty,
and needs no addition. We have a most atrocious
habit of finding bad names for good places, and
spoiling them when they are excellent. We must
clap on a
ville
or a
ton
, when there is no sort of
necessity for it. How much do we improve
Rutherford
,
as the name of a village, or Clinton, by
mounting it with a rider? I abominate these
terminations
!
How much better were Charleston,
as Ashley, and Georgetown, as Winyah, instead
of perpetuating clumsily, the memory of a
Scotch-French
profligate, or a Dutch-English-Hottentot!
Hereafter, say Haddrellthe Point will be
understood
.
Editor

Ita lex
.
Beauclerk
.Certainly, for such a pretty city,
Charleston should have a more appropriate uame.
Abbot
.It
is
a pretty City! With a thousand
deficiencies, it has yet a thousand attractions. Our
egotism has led us to insist upon our
moral
qualities
only; our graces of society, our frank
hospitality
;
the elegance of our women, the high
character
of our gentlemen. These are things, certainly,
of which we may be proud. But we have
regarded
these too exclusively, and have accorded
nothing
,
or but little, to the physical beauties of our
home. Certainly, no city could have been more
happily seated. Two tributary rivers enclose her
in their ample embrace. The ocean sweeps up to
her very doors, making a grateful murmur at her
portals, and bringing her the odors from a
thousand
islets of the deep. If she lacks a back ground.
such as high mountains alone can bestow, she has
a compensative beauty, thus rising nymph-like,
from the very bosom of the waters. Had our
architecture corresponded more with our
situation
,
there would have been few cities along our
Atlantic border to surpass, or even equal her, in
beauty to the eye. But our buildings are
generally
very wretchedly conceived. Our architecture
has been
sui generis
. It has borne no likeness to
anything in heaven or in earth, or in the waters
that surround the earth.
Editor
.There is an improvement, Father.
Abbot
.So there is! We have now some
clever native architects, and they have done
something
already, and will do yet more. But a great
deal is yet necessary. There is one important
preliminary
to be taught and
felt
, before we can do
any thing successfully in this department,
namely
,
that every climate has its own requisites for
building, and its necessities must determine the
character of its structures. Now, instead of
looking
to Venice for our models in Charleston, we
have been going back to the Greeks. The
Yankees
first fell foul of the Greeks, and made sad
havoc of their mighty fabrics. A retired
shopkeeper
in Manhattan will build his kitchen after
the plan of the temple at Icomium, and the model
of the temple of Theseus, is the humblest that he
could choose after which to plan the little
structure
at the extremity of his half acre lot, which,
considering its uses, need not be seen at all. The
passion for Greek models, for a season, spread here
and there, and every where among us. And it
was all a monstrous absurdity. We can admire
the glorious fabric of Minerva, kissing the clouds
from a lofty elevation of a thousand feet above the
sea; but the same building, squatting down in the
streets of a squat city like Philadelphia, is a
manifest
absurdity. These ambitious imitators
over-looked
the fact, that the Greeks planned their
buildings
for mountain elevations. They were made
low and bulky accordingly, the mountain being,
in fact, a great foundation pile for the edifice. To
relieve the weight of the buildings they were
surrounded
by colonnades. If these colonnades were
necessary to the relief of a building when on a
mountain, how much more necessary on a plain?
Yet, among us, the side columns, which were
thus employed for the purpose of lightness and
relief, have been knocked away entirely, and the
density and dulness of the structure have been
correspondingly increased. Our models should
be found among the old states and cities, the sites
and climates of which have some correspondence
with our own. As I have already said, some good
ideas might be got from the architecture of Venice
we might look also among the Byzantines,
and something quite as good might be gleaned
from the abandoned stores of the Moors of
Grenada
an
elegant people; the atmosphere of their
region resembling that of Charleston, if the
scenery
does not. I have no doubt that our best
models
would be found among the Saracens of the
time of Abderrahman. They were a people
accustomed
to warm climates, of exquisite tastes,
and a rare appreciation of all the luxuries of life.
How they would have adorned that Battery!
What glorious courts, what delicately wrought
columns, what umbrageous verandahs, what
minarets
and porches, with what a happy distribution
of light and shadow, sparkling fountains and
Mosaic
avenues and pavements, to say nothing of the
green relief from vines and festooning shrubberies,
would they have made to crown that promontory,
so beautifully placed at once for ostentation and
enjoyment. There is a corner lot, one of the best,
still remaining at the point of the Battery. I know
not who owns it, or whether it remains in the
hands of the city or not. If it does, let them sell
it at any price, to some man of equal taste and
wealth. Let him employ one of our excellent
young architects, and let the space be crowned
with a couple of light Moorish towers, connected
with a court of columns opening on the south.
The towers should be quite lofty. Indeed, to be
light, they must be so. The basement should be
sufficiently high to enable the architect to begin
the real building at a point sufficiently above the
line of the Battery, as to be distinguishedbase
no less than apexfrom the sea. It was a sad
error in those who built, having any part of the
building
below
this line. This basement, given up
to the offices, to kitchen, and even carriage house,
would leave the lot, otherwise a small one, large
enough for all purposes. Such a structure,
judicionsly
adapted, would give that
finish
to the
Battery
,
which is at present its great deficiency. There
is a new Custom House to be built. What a
glorious
chance here for a fine structure, looking
loftily
out upon the sea! And a model adapted from
the architecture of the Saracens, would be of the
very best sort, inasmuch as their style is
susceptible
of the most various application. Every
requisite
vault, office, court, or chamber, essential to
such a building could be had; while the structure
at the same time, would accord with and relieve
the flatness of the sight, and could be adapted to
soothe and disarm the oppressive languors of the
climate.
Editor
.We are passing Castle Pinckney. Do
you remember, Father, whether that Fort existed
in the Revolution?
Abbot
.It did not. It was simply a
marshflat
,
with very little soil, such as you see its
unoccupied
extremity now. I believe that its chief
uses were as a place of execution. Remind me to
ask our venerable friend, Dr. Johnson, if it was
not there that Tweed and Ground water were hung.
It was there, certainly, or at White Point. I
believe
that many of the Pirates, by whom our coast
was haunted in ante-revolutionary periods, were
justified
at the spot now covered by the Castle.
What a pity that Government does not enclose
and build upon the
whole
of this flat, making an
ample Citadel, which, even if Charleston were in
the hands of an enemy, could, if well provisioned,
be held by five hundred men.
Editor
.But its health is said to be doubtful.
Abbot
.Would not enclosure, with a wall of
stone, and filling up, render it healthy? Would
it not have the effect also of contributing to deepen
the channel and the harbor, by circumscribing the
river, and preventing the wash from the shoals?
Fort Johnson in the Revolution, was then
employed
to do the duty of Castle Pinckney; but it
answered
the purpose very imperfectly. Its guns
failed to cover the ships of the British lying in
Rebellion Roads.
IV.
Abbot
.You spoke justly when you bestowed
a passing compliment upon Master Hillard, to
whom our public owes much in the way of
improvements
.
His Line is a good and useful
one. The boats are sufficiently large, and, under
existing circumstances, run sufficiently often, with
a single exception, to the Island. There should
be a night boat from the Island to the City,
leaving
at ten, and running while the weather is fine,
and on moonlight evenings. The sweetest period
of our day is from the approach of sunset, until
the small hours of the night. Those who take a
prolonged siesta, before or after dinner, will always
remain bright and vigorous till midnight. Let me
counsel this improvement, which must be equally
grateful to monks, as to maids who love the
moon.
Editor
.He shall hear of it.
Abbot
.Master Hillard hath done other things
which deserve our countenance. He hath erred
only in stopping just at the point where his
greater exertions should have begun. I have no
sort of question that Haddrell, with its groves
opened fairly, and proper pathways smoothed
along the sea, with ample grounds for exercise
and sport, would, in these gloomy and perilous
days, when cant and cholera assail us every where
at the North, become quite as attractive and
grateful
to our people, as any of the thousand watering
places which they rush abroad to visit. But money
must be spent, and largely too, before the scene
can be made what it should be. At the North,
nobody
thinks that nature can prove the sole attraction,
without the help of art. They furnish her with all
manner of assistants, and we must do the same, if
we hope to rival the Yankees. It is enough if
nature gives us the
susceptibilities;
we must do
the rest. Our people have been spoiled with
luxuries
.
They require easy carriages, fine
steamboats
,
pleasant lounges, rich parlors, gay pictures,
and the best of feeding. See how the small wits,
who set out for our interior, professedly to see
nature
in her fastnesses, complain of their landlords,
and the excess of lard in their gravies! We must
provide for all this sort of people. To make
Haddrell
what it should to be, requires money. But
I am free to say that, with money properly laid
out, there would be few places better calculated to
persuade the summer wanderer. Certainly it
might be made a sort of Hoboken for us; a place
where, of an afternoon, you might see hundreds
from the city, young and old, taking the air along
the shores, and sheltered from the sun, at the same
time, by overhanging forests.
Editor
.For an afternoon's exercise, or even
for a day, the thing might answer. But there
would be no stopping there at night. The Village
of Mount Pleasant is healthy enough; but even
at Shell Hall the case is very doubtful.
Abbot
.I have heard so; but these statements
rest generally on tradition. All newly opened
places, in the low latitudes, are of doubtful health
at first
. But drainage, and free ventilage, by
opening avenues through the forests, and clearing
up the undergrowth, repairs the evil; and the
children of the soil are as healthy as any others.
We are too well disposed to believe these
traditions
in regard to the dreadful sickliness of places
among us, which should be fostered rather than
deserted, since this belief furnishes us with an
excuse
,
which we desire, to get away. We find
very poor people, who cannot leave the swamp
neighborhoods, enjoying comparatively good
health,while their children flourish and fatten
in spite of malaria. Charleston, itself, now one of
the healthiest seaports in the Union, was, at one
period, known as the American Batavia! What
has wrought the change? What but drainage,
ventilage, and a denser population, sufficiently
numerous to work these improvements? So of
many of our country villages. Orangeburg, for
example, one of our oldest country towns, had the
worst of reputations for its unhealthiness. It is
now known as a summer retreat, equally healthful
and agreeable. Haddrell is so situated that, with
proper clearing and drainage, it cannot but be
healthful. There are few influences from which
malaria should arise. The winds, in summer,
prevail generally from the South and Southwest;
and all the places that are open as this is to the
breezes from these quarters, are usually the
healthiest among us. These winds sweep towards
it from the open bay. The soil is little more than
sand; the vegetation no where in the
neighborhood
,
seems to acquire much rankness; and, all
things considered, I fancy the tradition of its
sickliness
rests upon very doubtful authority. At all
events, a little pains-taking ought to render it
unequivocally
safe and salubrious. What glorious
bathing regions might be had all along these
shores
Beauclerk
.But for the sharks!
Abbot
.Confound the sharks! Do I tell you
to rush into their jaws? I say
might
be had.
Pillars made of our Charleston Cement, (
Bowman's
Concrete,) with stakes driven between,
might be made to take in a vast extent of level
beach. From this line of pillars and stakes, which
effectually shuts out the sea attorney, you have
only to stretch out awnings or tents of canvass:
each family might have its own; and here Beauty
might take her bath, in the embrace of Neptune,
without even the eye of Apollo to disturb her
security
or compel her blushes.
Editor
.Are you aware, Reverend Father,
that you have been somewhat anticipated in your
cogitations, touching the susceptibility of Haddrell
as a place of afternoon resort for the goodly people
of the City?
Abbot
.Most likely! Great wits jump together
you know. But what have you on this subject?
Editor
.Some one of our hundred City Poets
has touched upon the theme in one of the
newspapers
.
I happened upon a fragment in an old sheet
the other day. The writer describes the drives of
some heroine, of whom the scrap which I happened
upon could afford me no other information. But
that need not affect us. The portions in point are
these. You will see that the Poet has caught your
idea with the most perfect accuracy.
Abbot
.By anticipation. Proceed!
Editor
.(Reads.)
She made the round of the Battery, twice or thrice,
In this triumphant manner;gazed about,
And thought James' Island look'd exceeding nice,
With its great crown of pines, so tall and stout;
And wonder'd why we had no such device
In Charleston, for its people to go out,
In summer,seeking still such pleasant places
As Gotham keeps to cheer her mingling races.
There were the sister-islands, just at hand,
Over that arm of Ashley and the bay;
The drives are excellent along each strand,
And sweet the beach where rolling breakers play;
Between, are groves by ocean breezes fanned;
Beyond, it must be very sweet to stray,
To fields Elysian,such as in New Jersey,
Invite alike the folk in cloth and kersey.
We too might haveI speak it without joking
As sweet retreats for summer as the best;
We might command our Brooklyn and Hoboken,
Though no Wehawken crowns the Ashley's breast;
Yet nature has for us some joys bespoken.
Bright flowers, and forest shades our clime have bless'd,
Deep Groves invite us, which, with little trimming,
We might make precious for our babes and women.
C
There's Haddrell, for example! Some slight clearing,
The underwood removed from the old trees,
And you might ramble onward, nothing fearing;
Still looking out from Sullivan's to the seas;
While birds above, and boats beneath you, steering,
The languid spirits cheer, the fancies please;
And, wanting rocks, instead of sybil cavern,
Some Druid grot might answer for a tavern.
There Hillard might provide you with your ices,
As well as Marion and Petit;and there,
He might contrive the prettiest of devices
For tempting languid folks to take the air;
Swings for the childrengames at moderate prices,
To keep the young from ill, the old from care;
And show our Southern folks they need not wander,
Northward, their joys to seek, their sixpences to squander.
Abbot
.Well read, Mr. Editor, a good song
and well sung. The unknown rhymester hath
anticipated all my philosophy. May our mutual
counsels find their way to the thoughts of men of
action, and persuade Mr. Hillard to do the thing
handsomely. I am satisfied it will be done in
process
of time. Perhaps not many years will elapse,
when we shall behold all these headlands, these
green skirts of shore, crowned with beautiful villas,
smiling through noble avenues of oaks, or decorated
with drooping willows and redolent of myrtle and
orange. It needs but an increase of manufacturing
establishments near the city, and a large body of
operatives who require to live free of the heavy
burdens of city taxation, to make all these favored
spots of nature flourish under the auspices of art;
and how lovely will be the
coup d' il
when these
shores are all handsomely studded with nice white
boxes, with green blinds, and fancy pailings, even
down to where the billows kiss the beach. Look
about you, and behold! The
tout ensemble
, even
now, is, to my eye, singularly beautiful. The
expanse
of bay is admitted to be a magnificent one.
Before you lies the smaller space, crowned, on the
one hand, by Castle Pinckney, on the other by
Mount Pleasant; while, beyond, like a fairy
empire
,
rises up Sullivan Island, sweeping round like
a crescent, and circumscribing the area of water in
its rear, so that it seems fitted, by its snugness and
security
,
to be the proper abode of some such Lady of
the Lake as beguiled the King of Scotland into the
lowlier garments of the Knight Fitz James. To
the right, as you gaze, how beautifully does the
scene expand, smooth and blue, to the white
beaches
of James and Morris islands, upon which you
behold, soft and slightly curling, a lengthened line
of foam. The fortresses, Pinckney and Sumter,
relieve the expanse of water of all monotony; and
as the eye passes beyond, it rests with a sense of
pleasure, natural to every such scene of quiet and
delicacy, upon the lowly rising, but conspicuous
cottages upon James Island, nor turns away
dissatisfied
from the undulating sand-hills that stretch
outward to the sea. Back, you see where the
Ashley opensrounding the Battery, and
sentinelled
in its progress by that crest of pines directly
opposite, which forms a peculiar feature of the
scene. There the eye rests for awhile, reverting
finally to the city, over whichher spires, smitten
by the soft flush of a glorious sunset, beauty seems
to hang, hushed and happy in the arms of peace.
Turn we now to Cooper River, the Etiwan of the
C1
aboriginal possessors---what a sweet and
prolonged
avenue of water, girdled by greenest slopes, by
gentle headlands, its great trees stooping to the
stream, and following all its sinuosities, as if
guarding
the shores with suspicious care against all
intrusion
.
But we need not travel in this direction.
Is it not all written in the Book of Irving?
[1]
[1]
A Day on Cooper River.
Poet
.It seems strange to me, venerable
Father
,
that you have omitted to notice one peculiar
and very pleasing feature in this landscape: I
allude
to the skirts of green marsh which relieve the
eye on almost every hand, which contrast most
lovelily with the waters, and soften, with the most
delicate effect, the otherwise too bright glare of the
sands beyond. There is an islet with a single oak,
a mere hillock, rising from yonder bed of marsh,
How pretty and pleasing the appearance. Follow
the creek, now opening beneath the eye, and see
where a troop of cranes are fishing in the shallows,
their tall white forms showing brilliantly amidst
their spaaious empire of waving green. We,
perhaps
,
disparage the effect produced by these tracts
of marsh, in consequence of ideas that belong to
their supposed agency in promoting disease. I
am satisfied that their noxious influences are much
exaggerated. At all events, they add greatly to
the picturethey seem absolutely necessary to its
beauty, relieving its uniformity, and making it
picturesque
by the exquisite delicacy of the contrast.
Abbot
.It is true that I had forborne the
subject
,
but I had not overlooked it. It occurs to me
as it does to you. You have so well expressed
the thoughts proper to the additional effect, as to
spare me the necessity of further remark.
Something
,
however, in this connection, might be urged
in regard to our low country scenery generally.
But here we are at Haddrell. Do you know
anything
of the tavern kept here?
Editor
.I spent a day not long ago at Shell
Hall. It is kept by a worthy German, whose
name I forget. He gave me an excellent dinner,
very well dressed and served, and his demand was
moderate. What with books and billiards, and
delightful breezes, I spent the day most
delightfully
.
Abbot
.We will visit him hereafter.
Poet
.You were about to speak of low
country
scenery. It is the common practice to
disparage
it.
Abbot
.Unjustly. Every thing in the prospect
depends upon the mind of him who surveys it.
The mind, and the sort of preparation and training
through which it has gone, is the usual medium
for making the survey. To the eye that looks
only for its attractions in
form
, our scenery must
always be unimpressive. But it is full of
character
,
requires nice observation, and will reward
close study. It depends for its effect upon the
exquisite gradations of shade and color, the nice
blending of tints, the harmony of its transitions,
and, if I may so phrase it, a certain delicate
intensity
of life. It does not impose upon you, at a
glance, like the scenery of the North, or our own
back country. Its great deficiency is
in form
.
---There
C3
are no stupendous eminencesno frowning
heights, that, rising up like giants, stretch
themselves
with their grey heads into the clouds,
compelling
the admiration of men, and seeming to
challenge that of the gods. Our rivers run not
through ledges of bald rock, that threaten
momently
to tumble headlong upon the hissing steamboat
as it glides beneath. Our hills do not cluster
together
,
bald and desolate looking groups, as if seeking
alliance against the assaults of winter. Our
outlines
are neither startling nor imposing, but they
are persuasive and grateful. They do not strike
you at a glance, but it will please you in time to
study them. Nay, they will reward study, when
the object which depends for its effect upon mere
outline, will provoke none. After all, your vast
rocky or mountain pictures are very cold and
cheerless. They strike you with awe, but they
invite no sympathies. They demand your
wonder
,
but they yield and expect no love. You see
all their possessions at a glanceyou feel that
there is nothing in reserve. Beyond the grand,
bold outline, they have no treasures. They move
you at the first sight, but seldom reward a second;
and the mind at length becomes discouraged and
becomes discouraged and sad in their
contemplation
,
and turns from them to the crowded city, as
if seeking human association and relief. But the
effect is far otherwise of our Southern slopes, our
woods and waters. They do not strike you at
first, and seldom startle, but, at the same time, they
never offend. They rather woo and invite you by
their soft attractions. You wander among their
groves as you would among the enchanted bowers
of an Armida. They tempt you to look out for
enchantments. The brightness of their green, the
wondrous luxuriance of their growth, the rich glow
and glory of their flowers, the songs in profusion,
and of every note, of their profligate birdsarouse
the fancy, until the spiritual nature feels a flush of
expectation, which gradually peoples the scene
with fairy and imaginative creations. You are
won away, unconsciously, into thoughts and
musings
which give a strange and sweet vitality to
all that you behold. A thousand delightful
meditations
inform the mind, and you wander onward,
soothed and satisfied with attractive fancies that
give you the most appropriate companionship.
Nor is it the soft and gentle alone that is awakened
in your nature by these scenes. They can impress
with equal awe and solemnity. What more
imposing
spectacle than the dense pine forest,
stretching
away for leagues, a monotonous waste, like
that of sea or desert, of unvarying formsa realm
of equal shadow and silence, gloom and deep, in
which all the dwellers are crowned sovereigns
sovereigns without subjects,voiceless, hopeless,
heirlesswithout speech, without communion
waving to and fro their inexpressive heads, with
one unbroken swing of solemn idiocy! What
more wondrous and awful, than the very waste
fertility of our mighty swampsshrined in
flowers
,
wrapped in beauty, gorgeous in natural wealth,
rich in all shapes and colors, wondrous in vine,
and wreath, and jewelterrible in the startling
beauty of their reptiles, in the scream of their
C4
mighty birds, in the awful majesty of their deep
recesses? Their buds press your cheek as you go
forwardtheir vines stretch forward with a
thousand
fingers to wind you in their graspyour
footsteps crush perfume from their leavesyour
fingers are crimsoned with the delicious juices of
the wild grapeand life, in forms the most
magical
and
loveliness, in gleams the most musical
are ever rising to the senses, as if to persuade the
faith into those ancient fancies, which never left
such regions without their elves and fairies. The
deep impenetrable thickets skirting the narrow
river or oozy lake, seem the very regions of
ambush
and surprise; and you look momently to see
the feather-cinctured warrior darting out from the
shad, in all the panoply of forest warfare. A gloom,
which is not painful, gives a mysterious tone and
character to this peculiar realm of loveliness and
life, and the very droplets of sunlight that fall and
trickle through the tree tops and shrubbery upon
the earth below, seem so many wandering
shadows
shapes
of spiritual lifethat come only to
declare that, however little sought or beloved by
man, the region is not yet utterly abandoned of
Heaven.
Editor
.Take my arm, Father: we are at the
Island.
V.
Abbot
.My children, the day is over, and all
things are quiet now. The Island sleepsthe
peopleall but ourselves. Bring your chairs out
upon the beach. We will sit upon the solid gray
sands, at the very edge of the waters. Let us have
a table, and bring out a bottle of Champagne, that
our spirits may be refreshed.
Editor
.But, Father, what will people say?
Abbot
.Let them say! So long as we offend
none of God's ordinances, and violate none of the
laws of the land, let the fools's tongue wag as it
pleases. It is one of the curses of the community
that we perpetually ask what our neighbors think
of us. Vanity forever asks the question, and, in
doing so, shackles human freedom. Commend
yourselves to your own consciences, my children,
and be at peace. It is surely something
wonderfully
distressing to our little world, that we, the
Children of the Moon, venture to pitch our tents
upon the beach, and sit beneath the blue arch of.
Heaven, instead of the rude rafters of Mrs. Cheney
or Mrs. Stevens.
Editor
.Not that exactly, Father; though
that is something new in this region. But the
Champagne!
Abbot
.My son, drink you none of the
beverage
if you fear it, or your neighbors. It is a
proper prudence that children should not play
with edged tools. But we who know the uses and

the virtues of the thing, need not be so scrupulous.
Editor
.But your example, Father.
Abbot
.Would be bad, perhaps, if we drank
more than a bottle, or more than our heads could
bear. But such is not the case. If men never
trespassed beyond our limits, there would be no
sorrow from intemperance in the land. At my
age, with the habits perfectly formedand these
are among the best securities of characterI may
surely be presumed to be safe in my indulgencies.
Editor
.But the world will doubt. They
will suspect us of excesses. They will know
nothing of our limits.
Abbot
.Then is the world a transgressor.
The good Christian is bound to presume favorably
of the practices of men, when he knows nothing
against them. If he does not, his Christianity is
at fault.
Editor
.Public opinion, Father.
Abbot
.Is too frequently insolent, under the
pretext of virtue. Be at ease, my son; or if thy
doubts trouble thee, retire to the dwelling and
refresh
thee, by way of quieting them, by drinking
a few goblets of cool ice water. Meanwhile, thou
shalt have our prayers. I tell thee, my children,
there is something petty and peevish in the habits
of this little community of ours, whenever it comes
to sit in judgment upon its neighbors. Every
departure
from the beaten track, receives its
condemnation
from some upstart fool, no matter whether
the innovation be a virtue or a vice. We are such
miserable slaves of convention, that we crush all
individuality as a crime; though, in the exercise of
this very individuality, we find the source of all
great virtues. What are great heroism, great
self-sacrifice, world-blessing charity, but
depantures
from the common practices? We have got
into a world of humdrum here in Charleston, from
the uniform monotony of our habits. You cannot
change the style of your dress in any respect, but
you see stupid wonder opening its great eyes, and
silly conceit stretching wide its broad grinning
jaws, as if something enormous had taken place.
The old gentlemen begin to fancy some revolution
at hand, as did the Usher in the time of Louis the
Fourteenth, when he saw a nobleman enter the
royal presence with strings instead of buckles to
his shoes. A summer ago, I went into one of the
manufacturing establishments of the North, and
groped through a great collection of hats. I
desired
one, which should be light and softwhich
should not bind the head, or be burdensome to the
brain. I got me something which answered my
purpose exactly. It was fashioned somewhat like
the old Cavalier's hat, of the time of the Stuarts,
high crowned and slouch brimmed. But you have
seen the hat, my children.
Beauclerk
.Did not the brotherhood adopt it,
Father?
Abbot
.Well, what was the consequence? All
Charleston was aghast when they beheld it.
`What!' said one of our
habitues
to me, the day
after my arrival, `do you expect to force such a hat
upon the people of Charleston?' I fear me that I
answered somewhat irreverently, with regard to
the good people of Charleston. `Let them wear
what they please,' was my answer, `but pray you
suffer me to do the same.' It is, perhaps, the most
striking symptom of feebleness, a regard for petty
objects only, and an incapacity to rise to the
consideration
of more important concerns, that people
should waste breath upon costume at all. I can
respect the Turk who has a national dress, which,
once established, and suited to his climate and his
occupations, becomes a thing unchangeable by
fashion, and is no longer a subject of speculation.
When Mahmoud, in his blind zeal for reformation
among his people, beginning at the tail, rather than
the head, proceeded to clothe his troops after the
manner of the Franks, I was prepared to believe
that he was not the man to effect any good for his
people. And he did not. His whole labors were
a miserable failure. My sons, I pledge you in this
generous beverage. It commands itself gratefully
to the veins of an old man.
Beauclerk
.An old man, Father.
Abbot
.Seventy, at least, my son.
Beauclerk
.Impossible!
Abbot
.To those who count life by years, my
children, quite impossible. But you will not have
forgotten the line of our gentle Latin poet`
Actis
vum implet, non segnibus annis!
Change the
deeds to events, and the reading is admissible, and
the application is correct. A man lives in his
experiences
.
If to have seen, in a single year, most
of the sorrows that range through a life of seventy;
if to have broken all the ties that bind to friends
and kindred, in that short space of time; if to have
seen one's graves growing around himthe graves
of several generations at oncewhile he is yet in
the green of life, and ere his sinews have well
hardened
into manhood; if, in addition to this, to have
seen the wreck of all one's earthly fortunes, almost
of his hopes;be the usual experience of seventy
years, why should I not count mine at this
number
?
For such has been my experience.
Editor
.But scarcely one among us, Father,
wears more the aspect of youth than yourself.
Abbot
.Many a great oak waves a massive
coronet of green, my children, into whose core the
worm has eaten, and upon which it preys ever
more, without ceasing. It is pridepossibly, a
nobler feelingthat stifles the pain of its secret
hurts, and makes no outward confession of its
malady
.
But some one walks along the breakwater.
He stops, as if to muse upon the prospect. He
drinks in its beauty, in loneliness. There is a
something
in the scene which is refreshing to the soul,
and most men who think, need to refer often to the
refreshing influences of nature. There are some
men who have pleasure in no other communion.
I often meet with such men. I have one in my
mind's eye at this moment. You must all have seen
the man. He is known to us for large and various
endowments, classical acquirements, excellent taste,
and a spirited and glowing style in composition;
but you meet him nowhere in society. When you
see him he generally walks alone, and then not
often in the public thoroughfares. He goes abroad
towards nightfall, and his eyes are cast upon the
ground as he walks, or his vision pierces into space;
but he looks not about him for his fellow, and he
asks no man's communion. What is the secret
sorrow of this man: what his troubled dream;
what his defrauded hope? Who shall tell? Is it
a peculiar nature, an idiosyncracy, that wraps
itself
up in loneliness, as in a garment, brooding upon
its own heart, and not attuned for the communion
of any other; or is it the result of a
life-disappointment
,
the overthrow of a great and generous
ambition
,
which makes him feel, possessed as he is of
the best treasures of literature and of a
world-sufficing
mind, scornful of the very possessions which
are the envy of other men? My children, most
men who seek for solitude have great sorrows
which they are doomed to nurse in secret. Yonder
stranger may be one of this description. But for
this doubt, we should ask him here among us.
Abbot
.And such is not our custom, Father.
Abbot
.Here again starts up the shadow of that
conceited convention, which chills humanity and
denies sympathy to our neighbor. It has always
struck me as a delightful characteristic on the
Continent
of Europe, particularly among the Germans,
that, sitting beneath their shade trees, dancing at
evening, or quaffing the generous juices of their
grape, they entreat the passing stranger to their
festivities, and make him one of them at once.
What should they fear?
Beauclerk
.The contact with the vulgar.
Abbot
.True superiority has no such fears.
Vulgarity never shows itself on such occasions.
The rude man takes his tone from the social circle
which admits him, and adopts his new standard
with a wonderful instinct. He is charmed by the
complacency of the superior, and he never
trespasses
upon the proprieties, which stand like so
many guardian watchers around the happy
company
.
We gain nothing by our coldness. We
may lose much by our reserves. In this way, we
are told, by the highest authority, that the host has
frequently entertained an angel. For my part,
travelling as I have done, among the wildest
regions
of the South and West, at periods when
they were a thousand times, wilder than now, I
have never encountered anything but kindness and
hospitality. I seldom took with me any other
weapon than that which best suits the traveller
good humor. I have met roughness which springs
from ignorance, and not from ill-nature;
simplicity
,
but that which never vexed either a taste or a
judgment, regulated by a just sense of the
circumstance
or the situation; and a frankness that
requires
only to be met with a corresponding spirit, to
become a lasting and pleasant, if not a profitable,
friendship. Yet, ordinarily, the city-bred
gentleman
,
full of his conventional laws, and not able to
overcome old habits, or perhaps not capable of
perceiving their unsuitableness to his present
condition
,
seldom succeeds in winning the confidence
and sympathy of the forest-bred inhabitant, or the
rugged mountaineer. He will cherish his old strut,
and his new waistcoat, and be at particular pains,
always to remind the peasant, that he
is
a citizen;
the very thing he should avoid.
Poet
.Father, the City makes a very lovely
picture now. The moon touches those steeples
with the prettiest frost-work; and the metallic
shaft of the new Church in Wentworth-street,
flashes out at intervals with the happiest effect.
Abbot
.Yes, there are subjects all around us
for the pencil of Pictor. He is meditating some
of them now. Fort Sumter, by moonlight, would
make a conspicuous object; with the foreground
spreading from the beach at our feet, while in the
background sweet fairy-like glimpses might be had
of the village on James Island; a point further
west might enable him to bring into a corner of the
picture the crest of pines of which we have spoken
already, and of which Trouche made an excellent
portrait. His error was in reducing the extent of
water stretching from the Battery to the Island.
A glimpse of the Battery might also be included
in a wing of such a landscape. I confess that I
nowhere have seen prospects more lovely than
such as are afforded from the spot where we sit,
in a moonlight view. Mind you, I do not say
grand or even impressive, though in a storm the
same prospect would have its grandeur. But
sweetness, the charm of delicate repose, a fairy-like
vale of shining sands, green glimpses and shores,
that seem to steal upon you, relieved by
occasional
objects, such as Fort Sumter and Castle
Pinckney
these
are all present, and actively appeal to
the fancy for the moral adjuncts. Besides, there
is the aid of ship and steamer, now looming up
white with bellying canvass, or lazily rocking at
anchor, as if lulled into repose by the seductive
calm of winds and ocean.
Poet
.What a glorious spectacle in a storm
must these seas presentthe great billows rolling
in upon the beach, threatening destructionsworn,
as it would seem, to overwhelm the crouching,
shuddering houses, yet subsiding, smoothing down
their haughty crests, as they encounter with the
steadfast sands.
Abbot
.I have witnessed just such a
spectacle
.
It was in the summer of 18, I forget the
year. I can never remember dates. The Island
was fairly flooded. People fled to the upper
stories
of their dwellings, or to the Fort, for shelter.
I had my fears; for winds and seas seemed both
to have conspired for our destruction. The Gulf
appeared to have risen in fierce hostility, and was
pouring in upon us with its thousand squadrons
of blue and foam. Never did I behold such great
and threatening billows. As you beheld them
rolling forward, you involuntarily crouched,
expecting
them upon you. Mountain after
mountain
,
far higher than any dwelling upon the Island,
came tumbling headlong forward; and just when
it seemed inevitable that we were to be engulfed,
they would encounter with the shoal, and with a
hoarse groan would part, scatter, subside, and roll
upward upon the shore, covering it with their
waters, but no longer embodied in mighty and
overwhelming masses. The change of wind only
saved us. Terrible was the evening and the night
of that fearful day. I shall never forget the
spectacle
,
which a painful sort of fascination made me
eagerly contemplate, in spite of all my
apprehensions
.
Poet
.I remember to have heard just such a
description. There were lives lost on that
occasion
,
Father. One fair creature.
D
Abbot
.Yes! Yes! The event haunted me for
long seasons after. It troubled my dreams, and
furnished the materials of one of them, which so
impressed my imagination that, for a moment, I
ventured to usurp your lyre, my son, and shape
the oppressive fancies into verse.
Poet
.Let us have it, Father.
Abbot
.Surely! I have no affectations; and
there is something classical, you know, in
declaiming
by the shores of the sea to the music of the
billows
.
Homer, on the Chian Strand, must have
experienced a joy in doing so, apart from his
audience
,
in hearing the murmur of the waters which
he could not see.
Editor
.And Demosthenes.
Abbot
.I doubt if Demosthenes felt any of
the poetry of the situation. Softness, or the sense
of beauty, was not his province. But we need
not these or any examples to justify us here. If
there were any scruples, it might be that a
diseased
self-esteem, trembling at your conventional
usages, might suggest that some of the lodgers at
Cheney's are awake. In their charity, they would
suppose us mad, or drunk, to hear our recitations.
They certainly would never be liberal enough to
suspect that the spirit of Homer or Demosthenes
had been the source of our inspiration. And now,
children, remember that these are boyish verses,
written twenty years ago.
Poet
.We listen, Father.
Abbot
(Recites.)
I dream'd that I was walking by the sea,
Whose billows, forced by winds of Mexico,
Brought in the dark blue waters of the Gulf
Close to my feet. The breaking surges dash'd
In white foam round me; and a solemn song
Rose from the gathering ocean, which, at hand,
Hung threat'ning, as if challenging for prey,
The shores on which I stood. A narrow ledge
A low frail barrier 'gainst a foe so strong
Its own bright tribute, from the heaving deep,
Laid at the city's footas if to check,
The wild, free progress of its reckless mood,
Offer'd but feeble foothold, to the crowd,
Now crouching in their terrors. Soon, the waves
Come rushing upward; while the shores grew faint,
And buried their gray heads. A bird of wo,
Scream'd overhead in warning,then flew off,
In dread,and, with example, counsell'd me
To my own safety. On each hand, the seas
Rear'd their green crests, and, backward as I fled,
Their tongues pursued me with a gushing hiss
That threaten'd fiercer speed. The summer homes
Of the affrighted Islanders were gain'd,
And the wild waters, rushing in with roar,
Drove them to upper chambers, or the sands,
That sunk beneath them. Death was in the wrath
Of those wild torrents! Death upon the winds,
That gave the torrent wings;and sights, and sounds
If sight were in the blackness of that night,
Or sounds in that one thunder of the wave
Spoke only, and spoke equally, for death!
Thus seem'd his empire certainand we fled,
A mixed despairing multitude! The weak,
Shrieking, unnoted, in the ocean's roar,
Vainly, for succor from that human strength,
Which then was strength no more!
There was a pile,
A stern, strong fortress, that, beside the deep,
Stood guardian of the City. It had borne
The storm of iron in the perilous hour,
Rearing its brows in conquest, and with pride,
D2
When the long day was ended. Thither, then,
We fled in safety.
We had fled in vain,
But for the victim! There was one, devote
That hour, to destiny!and the wild seas
Rush'd still insatiate on, with outstretch'd jaws,
And had not been appeasedwe had been lost
But quickly, from the crowd, a sheeted form,
Sprang out to ocean! Suddenly, a light,
Flash'd from the sated Heavensand we beheld
Each feature of the victim. Young and fair
A maiden in her budding. Pale, but bright,
Her cheeks were whiter than the drifting foam
That broke around us. In her lovely eyes
The light seem'd holy, and bestow'd on all
A delicate lustre. But a moment more,
Its lambent beauty cheer'd us, while she sprang,
Tossing in air her slender and white arms,
That soon embraced the billows. Down she sank;
And there was from the shore and from the seas,
A mutual crythe one of a deep wo,
The one of triumph!
And the storm was hush'd
In that same instant! Sullen from the shores
The waves went backward with a murmuring song,
And slept upon the deep. The ravenous sea,
Having its prey, grew calm; and all was peace,
Where all awhile was fright. But in my dreams
I yet behold that maiden, with her arms
So white and slender, tossing in the waves,
That sucked her down forever in their gulfs.
And now, my children, shall we walk? Leave
chairs and table, they are safe, and let us take the
beach till twelve.
VI.
Abbot
.Here we are at the beginning, the
present
terminous rather, of the Breakwater. The
rocks afford us a pleasant range of seats. The
point is a good one for affording grateful glimpses
of the prospect. Behind us lies the fortress,
Moultrie, in still and beautiful repose. Before us
rises Fort Sumter, looming us gracefully in the
moonlight. To the left you behold the uniform
revolutions of our Light House Star, shining, like
the smile of Hope, to the lonely wanderer, over
the multitudinous waters. The South line is
beautifully
bounded by the shores of James's Island,
and the eye, bending upon the West, loses itself
happily among the infrequent lights of the distant
City. Let us sit, my children, and enjoy the
delicious
charm of a prospect, which unites sweetness
with solitude, and the breathing hush of nature
with her tenderest beauties.
Editor
.The Breakwater seems to have
admirably
answered the purpose for which it was
designed. For this part of the Island it has
certainly
done wonders. Our beach had been nearly
swept away in this quarter. I have seen the
billows
breaking against Fort Moultrie itself; and,
it is said that a portion of the wall was undermined
by the ocean. Yet now, what a wide interval
stretches between the fortress and the sea, and the
sands are hourly accumulating. The old line of
rocks, laid down originally from the Fort, when
the effort was first made to arrest the ravages of
D3
the sea, is now nearly obliterated by the sands;
and the beach, from this point at least, to the
extremity of the Island, is, it strikes me, even
increased in breadth, infinitely beyond what it was
twenty years ago, when I remember the drives
along the whole front of the Island, as in admirable
perfection.
Abbot
.Such is my impression also. The loss
is on the inner quarter of the southern exposure.
Is this loss final? The breakwater precludes the
hope of again enjoying a beach drive in this
direction
;
yet is it so certain that the deposits from the
sea will not form a new beach
without
the
breakwater
?
Is not the shoal increasing at the point of
junction between the back beach and the front, and
will it not continue to accumulate when the stone
work is completed? The channel seems to me to
be destined to be circumscribed in width, while it
gains in depth. The mole on which Fort Sumter
is raised, will tend necessarily to throw from it
the press of water, on the one hand; while, on the
other, the stone line, stretching from Fort Moultrie
along the southern shore of the Island, to its
extremity
,
must serve, in like manner, to break and
defeat the action of the billows on the opposite
side. The agitated waters will leave their
deposits
,
which must gradually accumulate against the
breakwater, and, in process of time, the beach may
be renewed along the entire southern front of the
Island.
Beauclerk
.It is doubtful, Father, whether
this will be desirable. The result might be
productive
of other consequences, not the most
agreeable
.
The formation of a new beach
without
the
breakwater, might prove an obstruction to the
departure of the waters which now accumulate
within
. These now afford the most admirable
bathing places to the inhabitants. Nothing, indeed,
could be more admirable. The ground floor of
the bathing place is the most natural slope in the
world. You pass, inch by inch, from a depth not
over the latchet of your shoe, to your armpits.
The child of two years old may bathe in security,
while the athletic swimmer may wanton in the
most vigorous wrestlings with the billows. The
effect of any accumulation of the sands
without
,
would, probably, turn this inner body of water into
a lake, which might become a marsh. It is a
question
what contribution of its sands is made by the
higher portions of the Island towards filling up this
basin; and whether this filling up
within
, will
keep pace with the accumulations
without
.
Abbot
.Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
The progress of events must be watched, and
openings made in the stone at proper intervals, for
the free intercourse of the fresh billows with the
waters which remain within. It may be necessary,
a hundred years hence, to carry the breakwater
out a hundred yards farther. In that event, my
son, the subject is one which we may commend
safely to the consideration of our
great-grand-children
.
Editor
.I could have wished that the plan of
the breakwater had contemplated the enclosure of
the shoal at the Point. An obtuse angle, thrown
out, and returning, at this quarter, would have
D4
given a good finish to the work; would have
increased
the territory somewhat; and the proprietor
at the Point might have thrown above the stone
reservoirs, thus created, some such light and
graceful
specimen of Moresco architecture, in the shape
of a bathing house, as you have previously
described
.
If Sullivan's Island is to continue to increase
in popularity and population, as it has done
bringing from the interior, with each returning
summer, the
elite
of our Middle and Up-Country
Planters and Professorswe shall need all the
bathing places we can find. These must be
covered
also, since it will be impossible to enjoy the tides
during the day without such exposure to the sun
and eye, as few persons, properly educated, are
willing to incur. Besides, sea bathing in
perfection
should be taken
in puris naturalibus
. We
should strip to it as to any other pleasure. This
bathing in the obstructions of breeches and
petticoat
,
shroud and wrapper, is not only a very
unnatural
, but a very uncomfortable way of doing
the business.
Beauclerk
.I like the idea of tents for each
family pitched within the breakwater.
Editor
.Why not neat, light, graceful fabrics
of wood, with ornamental roofs, Saracen or
Chinese
.
Beauclerk
.Pagoda fashion?
Editor
.Yes! Just showing above the line of
stone, like so many nice little turrets.
Abbot
.No doubt something will be done to
meet the wants of the community, and satisfy the
requisitions of propriety and taste. The subject,
I am told, is in good
working
hands. A working
man is almost inevitably an improving one. The
erection of this Hotel is the first step; and a first
step is usually half the journey, as a first blow is
half the battle. Let the virtues of the Island be
once made known to the interior, and you will find
that they will be acknowledged by our own
citizens
.
Men who plodded annually to that vulgarest
of all social places, Saratogawhither every poor
devil was sure to go, who could raise a couple of
hundred dollarswill then begin to discover that
Sullivan's is a much more famous place than
Saratoga
.
That it is a thousand times finer place, any
one who is capable of judging must readily
acknowledge
.
Besides, it has advantages of a much
higher social tone than is to be found at any of the
summering places at the North, unless perhaps
Newport; whither our Southern gentlemen have
been so much in the habit of going, as, necessarily,
to have carried with them the delicacies and
refinements
of good society. Here, the intercourse with
a large city is hourlythe voyage short between
the two placesthe expense of transit a trifle,
which, with competitionwhich I am told is
threatened
and
an increase of population on the
Island,must be made still lower. There are the
markets of the city at your service; all the
resources
of the citybooks, society, amusements;
and you may even see, in process of time, the
theatrical
entertainments of the city, during the winter,
transferred to a summer theatre upon the Island.
In brief, you may command all the pleasures and
advantages of a large city, with all the quiet, repose
D5
and health of a country seat, and place of summer
refuge. You shall escape the cares of the town
its anxieties, heat and dust, without forfeiting any
of its pleasures.
Beauclerk
.What is the length of the Island?
Editor
.From three to four miles. The width
seldom quite half a mile, and frequently little more
than a quarter. The beach drive is estimated at
two miles and a half in length, and, in width, at
low water, from fifty to an hundred yards. As
you see, from the Fort to the end of the Island, it
is such a beach as you find nowhere surpassed on
the whole Atlantic coast.
Beauclerk
.Shall we walk it to-night, Father?
Abbot
.I think not, my son. We may try it
to-morrow. For the present, I prefer that we
should meditate, rather than explore. We may
drink in pleasure enough from the scene, by simply
unfolding ourselves to it. You see our Poet and
Painter, as they lie there, stretched out on the very
brink of the breakwater. The ocean breaks
beneath
them, sending the cool spray, glittering like
diamond dust in the moonlight, on their cheeks and
bosoms. Yet they heed it not. They seem to feel
it not. They are brooding, almost unconscious, it
would seem, in emotions which they cannot now
express. Some of these days, it may be a year
hence, you will see a painting, or hearken to a
poem, which will bring all this scene before your
eyes.
Beauclerk
.Certainly, Father, there is much
that is strangely beautiful in the scene, but much
that is cheerless also. Those heavy white hills of
sand have the ghostliest appearance, and there is
something saddening to my sight, even in the
grouped palmettoes which stand up, knee deep, in
the great grey hillocks.
Abbot
.What would you have, my son?
Would you have the season always winter, or
always
spring; the scene always green with grass
and shrubbery, and crowded with forest trees!
This is only one of the thousand aspects of the
various Nature. She puts on new forms and
features, accommodating herself to all the tastes,
and all the necessities of men. Here, you behold
her, in one of the earliest processes by which she
shapes a habitation for the race. Where we stand,
was once the empire of ocean. She hath plucked
this lovely place from his domain; she hath reared
it above his head, as a barrier to more valuable
empires; and thus roling his billows, forever
restless
,
against its modest shores, he seems to assert
his possessions, and to seek their rescue from the
usurper. You must look upon this scene with
feelings accommodated to the season of the year,
the temperature, the circumstances of the city,
your own exhaustion in its daily toils, and the
desire
which you feel to escape to places of refuge
in the enjoyment of novelties. The Island is
sterile, but who comes here to plant? It is
treeless
,
but cool nevertheless. These breezes, and
such nights, compensate for all deficiences of shade
and forest. The music of these solemn sounding
billows, the beauty of this silent and
spell-imploring
spectacle of sky and sea, and this verdureless
domain of sand, furnish the sensibilities and the
imagination with an empire no less grateful than
unique. One sleeps with a rare sense of pleasure,
having in his ears, in the last moment of
consciousness
,
the rolling murmur of these waters breaking
heavily upon the shore.
Editor
.But it is a mistake to speak of the
Island as verdureless. There are farms and
gardens
above, which show equally the taste and skill
of the cultivator, and the susceptibilities of the soil.
Clumps of cedar, of oak, and of laurel, gay shrubs
and fragrant myrtles, rise up among the sand hills,
giving you the
oase
amidst the desert, and
affording
,
on a small scale, some idea of that which is so
gateful to the traveller in the mighty empires of
the desert in the East. Truesdell, of oyster
excellence
and memory, has acquired high renown as
an island farmer. He makes sea and shore equally
tributary to his objects. One foot he plants in a
field of okra, another in a field of oysters. The
ocean breaks between his legs without disturbing
his securities. He looks on the right hand and on
the left, and feels that he is monarch of all he
surveys
.
He has been a patriarch to the oyster family.
It is wonderful how they have flourished under
his auspices. He has shown the wonderful
powers
of education, for the development of dormant
faculties. He has taken the unsophisticated muscle
from his native bed, where he crouched and lived,
rather than grew and flourished, and has given him
a knowledge of the world. His
proteges
, under
his benignant care, have grown to enormous sizes.
That he should require that they should yield of
their annual growth for the reward of their
benefactor
,
is but a reasonable appeal to their gratitude.
How little do the gourmands at Columbia, during
the Legislative session, conjecture the toil, the care,
the watchful anxiety with which he has reared these
young and artless creatures, that they may
minister
to the delights and appetites of the Statesman
and the Politician, exhausted by the toils of office
and the constant draughts, upon their wisdom and
patience, of a not easily satisfied constituency.
Truesdell deserves well of the Legislature, Father.
Abbot
.They tell me his Oyster Beds are no
more safe than those of New Jersey. Report
says that he has had to watch them nightly, at low
water, with a loaded blunderbuss.
Editor
.Very probably. It is difficult to teach
a negro that a property can be had in an oyster
before he is gathered; and, assuming that
Truesdell
planted his oysters, benevolently, and with no
other object than the good of the oyster itself,
Sambo and others of his tribe, conceived that his
sole object was reached when the young creature
had attained a marketable size. It cost the
excellent
proprietor, I am told, a matter of ninety
dollars
in advertisements against trespassers
announcing
and setting forth his rights; sixty in
blunderbusses and pistols, and some thirty more
in shot and powderto say nothing of the anxiety
and loss of restin keeping his
proteges
from
abduction
.
Statutes have not saved him always.
Abbot
.Truesdell is a benefactor my brethren.
If the man may be considered so who makes two
blades of grass occupy the spot which originally
could rear but one, he certainly deserves as much
who can convert a racoon oyster into a Blue
Pointer, or a Shrewsbury. We owe something of
gratitude to Truesdell. Something is due also to
the oysters. They have done the State some
service
.
Monuments have been built to thousands
whom we could have much more readily spared,
and who have been far less gratefully swallowed.
Beauclerk
.Talking of monuments, Father,
reminds me to ask whether the name of the man
from whom the Island takes its name was not
O'Sullivan.
Abbot
.It wasCaptain Florence O'Sullivan.
He seems to have been for a time a sort of
Alexander
Selkirk. His title to the Island must have
come from simple occupancy. The first account
of him, given in the history, is that which occurs in
Hewat. It appears that, during the administration
of Sir John Yeamans (who succeeded to Sayle,
the first Governor,) the colonists were on the eve
of civil war. The Government was feeble, and
the colonists quite unequal to their own defence
against the Indians. Their supplies from Europe
had failed them, and they became seditious. The
settlement at Charleston was about to be involved
in bloodshed. At this juncture, it appears that
Florence O'Sullivan had charge of a post upon the
Island which mounted a single gun. This was
probably mounted in a block house rather than a
Fort; and the block house was probably framed
of Palmetto logs, affording the suggestion, in after
times, for the construction of the fort, made famous
by the battle with the British fleet. It may have
occupied the self-same spot. Capt. O'Sullivan's
command may have consisted of half a dozen or a
dozen men. He was stationed here, rather to give
notice to the town of the approach of suspicious
vessels, than expected to offer any very serious
defence. At this period, it must be remembered,
that the coasts were covered with the pirate craft
of all European countries. Capt. O'Sullivan
became
impatient of the inferior duties which had
been assigned him. He shared in the discontents
of the people; and, being, as we infer from the
name, a son of Green Erin, he was not to be kept
from the fun when a fray was in progress. He
deserted his post upon the Island, hurried up to
the town, and took the command and direction of
the insurgents. But O'Sullivan was premature.
The fruit was not quite ripe. The Governor
maintained his ascendancy, and the worthy Captain
was arrested on a charge of sedition, and compelled
to give security for his future good behaviour.
The history tells us no more of Florence
O'Sullivan
.
Our provincial records might supply the
deficiency, and we recommend to some of our
young lawyers, who have not yet found the
business
of an approaching term too oppressive, to
look through the documents of the State
Department
.
I confess to only a vague notion of the
tenure by which he conveyed the Island to the
good people of Charleston.
Editor
.The inquiry deserves to be made.
We owe something to O'Sullivan, which we have
doubtfully acknowledged by stripping his name of
its Hibernian prefix. Still it is doubtful if we could
well avoid it. Something is due to euphony, and
the O! would scarcely help the name at present.
I wish we could restore the aboriginal name of the
Island. What will they call the new Hotel, I
wonder
?
It will not do to say Sullivan's Island
Hotel. nor is it altogether complimentary to a
hero to call a Hotel after him. Besides, the Fort
already bears the name of Moultrie.
Abbot
.The subject is a nice one.
Beauclerk
.What's in a name?
Abbot
.Much: in spite of Shakspeare, names
are things. The christening is one calculated to
give trouble, and leave some parties still
dissatisfied
.
I could wish to see the old Indian names
restored. They were eminently musical and
suitable
;
and if their meanings are not so obvious at
this day, they would certainly labor under no worse
disadvantage than attends half the names that we
employ. For the settlements here, the names of
Moultrie and Pinckney have been appropriately
chosen. They are words of meaning in association
with the scenes which they honored by their valor.
I could also wish that the name of Col. Thomson,
who had charge of the defences at the eastern end
of the Island, on the famous 28th of June, could be
also, in some way, distinguished by a local
appropriation
.
But I abominate the absurdity which
persists in tagging the names of Moultrie and
Pinckney with the French
ville
. What use? Why
not simply Moultrie and Pinckney? the village is
understood. Should another village spring up in
this wide waste tract between the two villages, I
trust that our Colonel from St. Mathews and his
sharp-shooters, will be remembered, and the new
settlement be called St. Mathews or Saint Thomson.
VII.
Editor
.It is mentioned, Father, that the
present
Fort does not occupy the site of that of
Revolutionary
memory.
Abbot
.I suppose not. It is understood to be
recessed; probably in consequence of that gradual
gain of the sea upon the land, which, of late days,
grew so imminent a danger. How many
fortresses
preceded the present, it is scarcely possible to
say. I myself have seen the
debris
of an older
structure, of brick, which we know did not
constitute
the material of the original fort which
Moultrie
defended. It is probable that, when the
successful
defence was made in 1775, the fort rose
greatly in public opinion, and money was expended
upon it. It was finished, and possibly enlarged in
plan, and improved in other respects. When, in
1780, the Island fell into the possession of the
British, it is not unlikely that they attached
sufficient
importance to it, to add still farther to the
strength of the works. These opinions must rest
wholly upon conjecture. No details have been
preserved. As a place of summer resort, I have
my doubts whether the British made much use of
it, while they were in possession of the State. It
may have been used as a sort of Lazaretto or
Hospital
,
or Quarantine refuge, as was Haddrell's
perhaps, like Haddrell's, as a deposit for
prisoners
;but
being in possession of a good Cavalry,
their favorite places of evening resort, ride, and
recreation, were Up the Roadthe Quarter
E
House, below Izard's camp, being the usual
terminus
of their wanderings. It was rather
unsafe
to venture beyond this point, and even here,
towards the conclusion of the war, they were
frequently
picked up by the Partizans.
Editor
.Have you ever been within the
present
structure, Father?
Abbot
.A thousand times, my son, while under
different commands. Recently, I had much
pleasure
in mounting the ramparts, and looking abroad
upon the glorious prospect.
Editor
.The place is admirably kept, Father.
Abbot
.It is; the Garrison orderly, civil, and
wearing those looks of brightness and intelligence,
which show great subordination, without
despotism
.
This is highly creditable to their officers,
none of whom have I the pleasure to know.
Editor
You should know, them, Father.
They are all fine gentlemenintelligent and
graceful
;
soldiers who have served honorably in
Mexico
,
and wear their laurels modestly at home.
Abbot
.The school is a good one, my son, for
social as well as soldier-training. A military man,
where the service is an honorable one, must always
be a gentleman. The
prestige
of the service
compels
it, and society recognizes him. Where the
great body of a people are fighting menvalor
being the common property, and cowardice the
melancholy exceptionhigh refinement, the result
of intelligence and polish, must inevitably belong
to the officer, since, otherwise, there would be
nothing to elevate or distinguish him above his
men. He who does not feel this and act upon it,
becomes rapidly degraded, and passes out of sight,
if not out of the service. The day is gone by,
when a rough and surly monstera drinking,
swearing, strutting animal, who had nothing but
brute courage and his epaulettes to mark him as a
soldiercould pass muster in society. We
undoubtedly
owe a great deal to the Military School
at West Point. I am free to say that the South
should have such an institution also. I would
plant it somewhere, looking down at once on the
Gulf and Atlantic, among the mountain ranges of
North Carolina or Tennessee.
Beauclerk
.I can conceive of no greater
injustice
,
Father, than that which, in our popular
histories
,
gives so much credit to Charles Lee, for his
share in the action of Fort Moultrie.
Abbot
.There could be no greater. Lee's
share in the defence was really none at all; or what
there was, was discreditable to his judgment, if
not his manhood. The credit is due to John
Rutledge
,
William Moultrie, and his brave
companions
the
sons of the soil all of themwho took
their stations at the guns with but one feelingthe
conviction that they had to fight. Lee was not
willing to fight, steadily opposed the defence, and,
being an Englishman, with the most perfect faith
in a British fleet, swore bloody oaths, that the
fortress
was a mere slaughter pen, which the British
broadsides would `knock about the heads of the
garrison in half an hour. He would have
abandoned
it had the Governor permitted. Rutledge
swore, that before he would write such an order,
his right hand should be stricken from his body.
E2
Moultrie's temper, on the occasion, was not a whit
more yielding: If they knock the Fort about our
ears, we can still fight them behind the ruins,
was his language. Subsequently he said: I
never imagined that the enemy could force the
post. I always considered myself able to
defend
it.
Editor
.And he did!
Abbot
.Admirably; it was one of the greatest
actions of the war, and preceded the Declaration of
Independence, which was made six days
afterwards
.
We do not know the fact, but where was
the impossibility of having the news of this event
expressed in five or six days to Philadelphia? If
the fact was known by Congress, it doubtless
contributed
to the firmness of that body on that
memorable
anniversary. We know that the express,
bringing the news of the battle of Lexington, took
a much longer time in compassing the same
distance
;
but, at that period, no previous
arrangements
had been made for expressing intelligence.
Routes had not been opened, nor emisaries
employed
before hand; and these were the most
substantial difficulties in such a performance. But
we have no reason to suppose that, with the whole
seaboard anxious in regard to events in daily
progress
,
the public authorities would have neglected
the necessary organization of expresses. Besides,
it was known that a powerful British fleet had left
New-York, as it was supposed, for South-Carolina
or Georgia. How natural that the American
Congress
should employ all its agencies to ascertain
its destination and the result. I repeat, it is not
impossible that something of the battle of Fort
Moultrie was known in Philadelphia on the 4th
July ensuing; and the effect must have been
sensibly
felt. It was, in truth, a most bloody battle.
It has been shown that, for the number of troops
which they had engaged, the British loss was
greater, by far, than it was in the terrible victory
at Trafalgar.
Editor
.Yet how the account of this affair is
slurred over in our Northern histories.
Abbot
.How every thing
Southern
is slurred
over in Northern histories. We hear, for example,
in never ending declamations, of the Tea which
was emptied into the harbor of Boston. It is
scarcely known, even to our own people, that the
same thing was done in the harbor of Charleston.
New England claims to have done every thing,
first to last, in the Revolution! yet she did very
little. Her writers may well begrudge us the
great battles fought within our borders. Recently,
a most impudent attempt has been made to show
that these battles were fought by New England
troops; but the absurdity of the claim defeats
itself
;
and, fortunately, they have not been able to
destroy the records. It is curious that, even before
the Revolution, this tendency of New England to
usurpation (a characteristic always of the Puritans)
was emphatically dwelt upon by persons in
Carolina
,
to discourage the progress to union of the
several colonies against the mother country. They
distinctly predicted the pretensions of our Yankee
brethren. Josiah Quincy, who was sent from
Boston
to Charleston, as an emisary to foment the
E3
occasion for quarrel, states that one of a dinner
party, at the residence of Miles Brewton, urged
that the Massachusetts were aiming at
sovereignty
over the other provinces; that they now took
the lead; were assuming dictatorial authority,
&c. To this Mr. Josiah Quincy put in a modest
disclaimer, as a matter of course. The other
replied
,
however: You may depend upon it, if
the Colonies shake themselves free of Britain, you
will have your Governor from Boston. When it
comes to the test, Boston will give the other
provinces
the shell and the shadow, and keep the
substance
.
Take away the power and
superintendence
of Britain, and the Colonies must submit to
the next power. If New England did not
succeed
in this desire, or design, it was not because of
the infirmity of her ambition. She got the better
part of the Major Generals and Brigadiers at the
beginning of the war, and cursed the military of
the country with a most incompetent crew of
Captains
,
Deacons, and others fit only to be Deacons.
How much of the prediction might have been
verified
,
subsequently, had not New-York been more
favorably situated, not simply for commerce, but
for connection with the South? Let the South
once set up for herself, and where will be
New-York
?
Editor
.I heard it stated some time ago,
Father, that, when the battle was actually in
progress
at Fort Moultrie, the Priest at St. Michael's
prayed for the success of the assailants, to the
wives and daughters of the garrison; who left the
Church in a body, accordingly.
Abbot
.The story, I suppose, is true. I have
not only heard it repeatedly, from old persons, but
I have seen it somewhere in print. I don't know
but what you may find it in Dalcho, together with
the name of the officiating minister. It must not
be forgotten, however, that the Church was a State
establishment, under the control of the Church of
England, and most of the Divines of that period
were sent to us from abroad. These matters
deserve
the attention of our antiqueries. I wish we
could persuade some of them into giving us a
series
of walks about Charleston. I do not know
any city in the Union, which might be found more
abundantly rich in antiquities. How many trials
by storm and fire hath she undergoneby siege
and battle! how many adventurous enterprises
hath she undertaken! Her people were always
military. She carried her arms to the banks of the
Mississippi, and fought the French in their own
colonies. Her troops traversed the waters of the
St. John's, and the Mauvilla, (Mobile) and her
harbor
has been penetrated by French, Spanish, and
piratical assailants. Thrice has she been besieged,
and in no instance hath she been dishonored, even
when overthrown.
Editor
.The chronicle is a beautiful and
extensive
one, which records the patriotism of our
women of Charleston. There is one item,
however
,
Father, which comes from good authority
that of one of the oldest inhabitantswhich has
never been in print. When Charleston was in
possession of the British, the women of the place
would frequently procure passes to go to their
E4
farms or plantations in the country. They seized
these occasions for carrying forth supplies of cloth,
linen, and even gunpowder and shot, to their
countrymen in the Brigade of Marion. These
commodities were concealed beneath their
garments
;
and, in preparation for their departure, the
dimensions of the good women were observed
sensibly
to increase. At length it was noticed by the
officers on guard, that the lady, who, when she
left the city, was of enormous bulkof absolute
dropsical
physique
would return reduced to a
shadow. Strange suspicions naturally ran in their
heads as to the causes of a change so surprising;
and these suspicions were not always creditable to
the fair fame of the lady. But other notions, less
unfavorable to her virtue, began to prevail, and at
the expense of her safety; and it was arranged
accordingly to subject the emigrating parties,
hereafter
,
to a test, which should infallibly exhibit the
nature of a disease which had such curious results.
Accordingly a jury of spinsters was provided, and
the fat ladies were taken into custody. The
discovery
was awful in the last degreebales of blue
broadcloth were unrolled from about the
slenderists
waists; and swan and duck shot, and
gunpowder
and ball, rolls of duck and cotton flannels, and
Heaven knows what besides, appeared from
beneath
the ample petticoats, attesting the patriotism
of the sex. This put a stop to their growth, as
well as their peregrinations.
Abbot
.No doubt a world of anecdote is yet
forthcoming, My venerable friend, Dr. Johnson,
has a great variety of stores of this sort, which
should make their way to the public. A
Stranger's
Guide Book through the cityand this
might include the Parisheswhich, at that period
were in singular and close connection with the
citywould be as full of interest as a popular
novel. The habits, manners, customs, sports,
trials
,
troubles, adventures, anecdotes of life in
peculiar
forms, and society under the most various
circumstances, are still to be gathered and
described
,
in regard to Charleston, if the subject is
seized upon now, and before the present
generation
passes. Another race will know nothing of
these things.
Editor
.Such a book would need be published
by subscription, otherwise it would scarcely pay.
Abbot
.True, we are exceedingly patriotic,
but don't like to pay for it. True patriotism
would say, that such a volumeevery volume,
indeed, which illustrates the deeds and virtues of
our peopleshould be a
family book
. It should
be in every library; and yet  but the subject
is an ungracious one.
Editor
.Will it ever be any better?
Abbot
.Yes, when our individuality stops
short of mere
egtism
, and, in the development of
a peculiar nature, is yet modest enough to
remember
all its debt of gratitudeequally to the past
and the present. Hearken, my son. We have
been discoursing of Moultrie and his public
services
.
His is one of those names by which we
swear. He constitutes a portion of that sectional
capital of character, of which we may boast to our
neighbors, and to foreign nations. He is
ours
,
E5
and, therefore, we boast. Now, listen. It is now
fully a year, since I read in the columns of the
Charleston Mercury, a communication, from an
anonymous source, which pointed out to our
public
the fact, that this same Moultrie was reported,
annually to the Legislature, as a bankrupt debtor
to the State, to the amount of some five hundred
dollars! The writer of the article proffered to
join with others in a subscription to efface this
offensive
and ungracious record from the books!
In vain! I am glad the suggestion was not
adopted
.
It is an act which the Legislature itself should
perform, for its own credit, and to save the State
from shame. As it is, the only monument to
Moultrie's memory, which we keep in repair, is
one to his reproach and shame! Moultrie was
poor, and died so. His virtues and honesty have
never been impeached. Let our people boast no
more of the memory of this man, until the State
shall have written against his name, in the
language
of Loredano,
L'ha pagata!
He has
more than paid her. Something will be always
due to him, which the future can only
acknowledge
!
Beauclerk
.Our Poet and Painter seem asleep,
Father.
Abbot
.Not they! I never rouse them when
they dream. I know that we shall get the benefit
of all their dreaming hereafter.
Editor
.See, they bestir themselves.
Abbot
.We will join them. Ho! Son of
Apollo
,
arouse you! We are in our moment of
exstase
,
and you have doubtless passed through yours.
Give us the fruits of your inspirations. I see that
the Muse has been with you. You would else
have never been so quiet. Come, my son, the
Poem. Let us taste the quality of your fruits.
Beauclerk
.A sentence! a sentence!
Poet
.But, Father! extemporaneous verse, as
you well know
Abbot
.Is no verse at all, you would say. No
matter. We are indulgent. Leave off your
damnable faces and begin. Is this a time for
affectations? Speak, sir, the Poem! It is a
decree
of the Brotherhood.
Poet
.I obey. (Recites.)
Soft is the veil of moonlight o'er the waters,
Softly the swell, upon the shore, of billows,
Soft in the distance, the great city's spires,
And soft the breeze.
Peace is upon the land and on the ocean,
Peaceful the slumbers of this ocean hamlet,
And the blue concave, by a cloud unshadow'd,
Speaks still for peace!
Before us sleeps a mound, whose solemn shadow,
Beseems the red man's tumulus of ages,
As keeping in its deep and vaulted chambers,
A realm of dead.
With gentle light, the moon stoops down to hallow,
The deep repose that wakes not to sweet voices.
She leaves her smiles, where sad, in seasons' vanish'd,
Man left but tears.
No sleepless bird disturbs, with cry or music,
Unsuited to the quiet, deep and sacred,
Where silence, in her own primeval temple,
Still rules supreme.
Who that beholds that ocean wrapt in brightness,
Who, that enjoys embrace with these soft zephyrs,
That feels the beauty and the calm about him
Would dream of strife?
Would dream of tempests raging o'er this ocean,
Clouds in that azure vault, its charm effacing,
And for this breeze, so meek, yet full of fondness,
Would look for storm!
Yet will the tempest, with a wild transition,
Stifle these gentle breathings of the zephr,
While great toruados sweep the face of Heaven,
With all its charms!
Yet will the seas, in beauty now reposing,
Boil up in madness, and o'erthrow their barriers,
Defacing lawny shore and verdant meadow,
Now blest with peace.
Thus, in a moment, let the foe but threaten,
That silent mound becomes a fiery fortress,
Whose flashing death-bolts, hurtling o'er the waters,
Ring out his doom!
Such awful change, of old, this shore hath witness'd,
When first our young Republic, bold but feeble,
Claim'd, though at peril of all wreck of fortune,
Her place of pride.
Thus calm the seas, when o'er the waters raging,
Rush'd, swollen with wrath, the giant form of Britain,
Her thunders hurling on our peaceful hamlets,
With hate of hell!
Thus silent lay our bulwarks of Palmetto,
Behind them, little groups of youthful heroes,
Waiting the signal, when, with answering thunders,
To meet her wrath.
How patient was their watch beneath that banner,
The slight blue streamer, lighted by one crescent,
That show'd the modest hope that warm'd their courage,
In that dark hour.
How doubtful, yet how fearless of the struggle,
When, in the strength assured, of thousand battles,
Britain, in armour, 'gainst the youthful shepherd,
Came fiercely on!
Doubtful our young men stood, but undespairing,
Not blind to all the fearful odds against them,
But sworn, in faith, that finds it better falling
In fight, than fear!
How beautifulas serpents fang'd with venom,
Glided the swans of battle to the conflict,
Their streamers flaunting with Britannia's Lion,
Rampant in red!
How silently they moor'd beneath our fortress,
Unmuzzled their grim ministers of vengeance,
And waited but the signal, to send terror
Among our sons.
One awful pause preceded the wild tempest,
Then roar'd the storm, and fell the hail of battle,
A thousand fires were lighted, in a moment,
At Moloch's shrine!
One look of yearning to the distant city,
Where hung in tears and fondness, wives and mothers,
Forms of most fond delight, and dear devotion,
Weeping in prayer!
And then, the brave hearts of our youthful warriors,
Nerved with new courage by those sweet spectators,
Conscious what hopes and eyes were set upon them,
Rush'd to the strife.
Thunder for thunder, and defiant voices,
Bore witness to the love that faced that conflict
How the brave spirits, battling for their homesteads,
Defied the Fates!
Through the long day of summer, still unshaken,
They stood beside their cannon, while each broadside,
Shook their frail rugged bastions of Palmetto,
But shook no hearts.
There Moultrie coolly stands, the scene surveying,
Ranging his muzzles on each mighty frigate,
Speeding each fearful missile on its mission
Of blood and wreck!
There Marion ministers, his young Lieutenant,
Wheels the swift piece, and sights the flaming cannon
Or, when the bullet rends the reeling vessel,
Shouts loud with cheer!
There, stout McDonald, slain upon the rampart,
The first brave martyr in the fearful battle,
Shrieks, as he falls: I die, my gallant comrades,
But not our cause!
Down sinks the crescent streamer of the fortress,
While o'er the city sudden darkness lower'd,
As if a star, the only one in Heaven,
Had sunk in night.
But, lo! it rises from the cloud, and waving,
Reveals the lithe and active form of Jasper
He plucks it from the beach, and rears it proudly
Through all the storm!
If then one heart had trembled in its terror,
It gathers hope and pride from that glad omen,
And hears the whisper'd cry from each fond mother,
Be strong, my son!
And they were strong, as for the rock, the eagle,
Who hears the cry of young ones in his eyrie,
Assail'd by subtlest foes; and bends his pinion
To guard his nest.
Day wanes, and night hangs out her starry banner,
Blue spread the curtains of the sky for slumber,
Peace soars aloft, as if in pray'r imploring,
For peace below!
But still the cannon thundered with its mission,
Still spoke fierce music to the hearts of valor,
Still shouted high the brave, and shriek'd the dying,
'Till midnight fell!
The Lion-banner sunk, at length, in darkness;
The crescent soar'd, in every eye triumphant;
While in the distant city rose the shoutings
From hearts made glad.
With dawn, the shatter'd hulks to sea were drifting;
Upon the shores the gentle waves were breaking;
And, with the triumph of our virgin valor,
Came peace once more!

Editor
.
(rapping at the Abbot's window)
Father, you bade me call you at daylight. It is
now dawning, and the tide is pouring in
magnificently
.
Abbot
.Son, I will be with you in an instant.
I have but to slip into my drawers, since I
understand
that bathing here is conducted
selon les regles
.
Editor
.I fancy you need not be so
scrupulous
.
It is so early that objects are scarcely
visible
at any distance. You see but the vast spread
of the waters; and the breakwater, though
contrasted
with them, seems but a remote and
indefinite
line upon the horizon. Beauclerk has
presumed
upon the doubtful light, and is in that
primitive
condition which suggested to Eve the uses of
the fig leaf.
Abbot
.The irreverent dog! But I will not
follow his example. I am ready: and now, my
son, remember that you have more than Csar's
fortunes to take care of. I have been modestly
reluctant, all my life, to venture out of my depth.
Should you see me floundering confusedly,
kicking
away with amazing rapidity, and yawing about
like a vessel in the hands of a tipsy helmsman,
remember
to come to the rescue. I fancy I am one
of the few Charleston boys that cannot swim. I
tried it when a boy, but could never work the
vessel
and keep her afloat at the same time. My head
had always a leaden-like proclivity downwards,
and I could never learn. I believe that some men
are denied the faculty altogether. You are aware
that this is the case with some horses, who will
rather lie down in the water, or wade along upon
the bottom, than make the attempt. No practice,
no frequency of experiment, ever changes the
result
.
The vulgar superstition in the country is,
that all
May colts
have this disposition to lie down
in the water, though it is not said that all May
colts refuse to swim. I was once nearly drowned
crossing an arm of Pearl River, in Mississippi, by
the mulish tendency of my steed in this matter.
The stream though a frequent ford, was swollen
beyond its bounds. The atrocious beast went
down and down, the waters rising higher and
higher at each moment. They were soon at the
saddle skirts; soon over
my own
skirts; and, finally,
I was nearly lifted off by the current. I had only
to stick to the animal, to thrust my legs down, and
cling to his sides, taking it
coolly
(as you may
suppose
,)
while I saw the beast's head fairly go under.
It was but a moment, however, and in the next he
scrambled up a bank. Powerful and precious
was the long breath which we both drew in the
same instant, though from different emotions.
Editor
A narrow escape, Father. But here
you are in no danger. The water deepens
gradually
,
and at no ordinary tide is it above the head
within the breakwater. But I am with you, and
all the rest of us swim like ducks.
Abbot
.Or tadpoles! Beauclerk, I see, is
already
in. What a floundering and plunging he
keeps. I can see his white form as he leaps and
wantons in the glorious element. What a
delightful
faculty. What pride to realize the painted
picture of Shakspeare:
To beat the surges under you,
To ride upon their backs; to tread the water,
And fling aside its enmity; still breasting
The surge most swollen, that meets youyour bold head
'Bove the contentious waves still kept, and oaring
Yourself, with your good arms in lusty stroke!
This is, indeed, a power and a grace to be
desired
to
F
be toiled after; and I envy few
accomplishments
to my neighbors so much as that of
being an adroit and skilful swimmer.
Editor
.It seems strange, Father, that, with
such feelings, you never acquired the art.
Abbot
.Perhaps it is not so strange. My
education
in all things was greatly neglected in my
childhood. I need not say that most physical
acquisitions
,
to be well made, must be made in early
youth. Riding, for example, running, boxing, and
even shooting. Now, it so happens, that I was a
sickly child. My infancy was marvellously feeble.
I was half the time in the hands of the doctor,
drugged
and dieted. I lived in spite of him, but my
opportunities were lost; for years I remained
feeble
,
and timid accordingly. I shared not in their
exercises with the athletes of the school; and
books, from my close confinement, soon superseded
field and water sports, and studies; and now, it is
too late to learn, my son. I now see that
swimming
should form a part of one's education, as
becoming as dancing, and far more necessary.
What a place here for a swimming school. I trust
that our new Hotel will keep this matter in mind,
and keep a competent person always, and
convenient
places assigned, in which to teach the
youthful
athlete how to swim. The practice is
common
in England. The art is taught like boxing.
Editor
.A good suggestion. Franklin's
counsels
may be well enough; but
physical
accomplishments
are not to be learned from essays or books.
Practice is the only school; and the first
experiments
in swimming ought always to carry the
urchin beyond his depth: always taking care that
succor is at hand. This throws him upon his
resources
,
and brings out all his energies. It is thus
that he acquires confidence and courage. Now,
these are the first essentials, and these acquired,
all the rest is easy. A good swimmer is the most
audacious being in the world when in the element
he loves. The billows seem to be as conscious when
they have to deal with one who fears them, as the
horse, when crossed by a timid rider. Horse and
water equally take advantage of such persons.
They must equally be taught to feel, that he who
rides, is their master, and is determined to remain
so. Let him learn to slap saucily the billow on the
chops, and clap fearless spurs to the steed, and the
empire is his own.
Abbot
.A truth! The moral of the steed is in
the spur of the rider! I have heard with some
surprise that large numbers of sailors are ignorant
of the art of swimming. It is said that some of
them have refused to acquire it, and have given as
a reason that swimming is of no service at sea, but
a real misfortune; that it frequently prompts the
courage to experiments of extreme recklessness;
that in the event of danger, the good swimmer is
usually despatched on the perilous performance
made to swim on shore with a rope, for example
and if he falls overboard, at sea, the possession of
the faculty would only prolong his tortures and
his dangers. He prefers to sink outright rather
than protract a struggle, which will most probably
be uselesssince few are saved who fall overboard
at seaand be exposed to the agony of a piecemeal
F2
death in the jaws of the ravening shark. There
would seem to be some reasoning in the argument,
though it is difficult to persuade ourselves that the
acquisition of any power, by which we increase
our manhood, should be at any time an evil.
Editor
.The sailor who argues thus, argues
rather to excuse his deficiencies, I fancy, than to
prove their advantages. He probably belongs to
that class who swim stone-fashion, as you
described
yourself to do. He has found the acquisition
difficult or impossible.
Abbot
.But why take to the sea?
Editor
.From necessitythe world's ill
usage, vice, fugitive moods, and a thousand other
occasional impulses. I suspect that most of those
who go to sea, from erratic desires, are good
swimmers
.
Boating and swimming are likely to have
prompted their choice of vocation. Are you fairly
in, Father?
Abbot
.Up to the middle.
Editor
.Good! Let us wade some ten yards
further now, throw your hands
thus
, above your
head, and bury yourself in the waters.
Abbot
.It is done!
Editor
.That first shock reconciles you to a
bath of twenty minutes: only keep moving. It
may be well to make an effort, old as you are, to
float and swim. Use equal movements of arms
and feet, at the same time, occupying as much
surface
as you can.
Abbot
.That is, spreading myself out?
Editor
.That will keep you afloat; and to do
this will not be difficult, if you will only be cool
be not impatientbe not flurried. Be deliberate;
and this ought to be easy, when you remember that
you are within your depth, and may, at any
moment
,
lift your head above the waters. Timid
persons find their difficulty in this. They do not
give themselves time, get flurried, and having
swallowed a pint of sea-water, lose all stomach for
the experiment. There! that will do! I see you
understand me.
Abbot
I certainly contrive to float. How
delicious
is the temperature! How refreshing! The
morning, just after sleep, is always the best time
for the bath, from head to foot. The system is
relaxed from sleep. The nerves need the
restoration
of tone. The whole body demands the
refreshing influences of water, precisely as the
face and hands. But for the languor induced by
our habits, quite as much as our climate, such
would be the common practice.
Editor
.Look at Beauclerk, Father.
Abbot
.How the dog rollicks! What antics
does he play with the billows! He frolics like a
young colt, just escaped from the stables to the
common. What's he after now? Whither does
he go?
Editor
.Towards the stone wall. He is after
a dive, I fancy. Yes, there he clambers up. Our
Poet is there before him. Do you see their forms
together on the breakwater? They mean to dive
together. Both swim well, and I suppose they
design a match for the shore. You see them?
Abbot
.Yes, by Saint Jupiter, and both naked
as innocence. They are off. The plunge was a
F3
fine one; but, between us, Mr. Editor, there is a
little too much light, methinks, for such bold
experiments
.
The day thickens. Those bright
grey streaks, the sudden arrows from the eastern
bow, give us warning to depart.
Editor
.Not so, Father! Our Islanders are
reluctant risers. They will keep their pillows for
an hour yet.
Abbot
.I hope so: for, in truth, though no
swimmer, I find the bath a rare luxury. What a
generous glow! The sea is a buoyant couch. It
sustains me, though not its master. How sadly
sweet is the mysterious chiding of the waves
against that barrier of stone; and how softly, with
what velvet steps, did the tide creep in this
morning
.
I rose and looked forth some time before you
knocked at the window. In the dim light of stars,
I could discern the breakwater, and the flashing
billows beyond it. But within the basin there
was no sign of water. All was dull grey sands,
and that seemed only an hour ago. How
noiselessly
it stole upward to the very porches of the
dwelling. What a wondrous and beautiful
mystery
in the decree that moves these glorious
elements
,
in an order so matchless and unerring, and
all, as it would seem, in a service tributary to the
tastes and the fancies, no less than the common
wants of man! See you, in the east, where a
little
drift of white clouds, a sort of rippled muslin,
puts on a delicate carnation tinge. The day is
making progress. The sun will not be slow to
follow. We must hurry our bath.
Editor
.Not yet, Father; not yet! How I
wish that you could swim. I must take my plunge
from the breakwater also. I am half tempted to
do it on the outside. There can surely be no sharks
at this early hour. There is no proof that the
sharks rise with the fowls.
Abbot
.If fowls were their common diet, I
should presume that there could be no question of
their habits; but unless you can show that the fish,
which are their food, retire with the sun, and keep
perdu
until he re-appears again, it is mere madness
to risk anything upon the habits of the sea-wolf.
No! no! my son,
veto!
I forego none of the
functions
of the Father Abbot, even though half seas
over; and I positively forbid you trying any
foolish
experiment.
Editor
.I submit, Father. Yet you little
dream of the delights of breasting the more
vigorous
billows. It is then that the swimmer feels
himself, and exults in his possessions. You
remember
the line of Pollock, describing Byron's
passion for the sea. They seem, to me, among the
noblest and smothest of our heroic blank:
He laid his hand upon old ocean's mane,
And play'd familiar with his hoary locks.
Abbot
.They are fine, but borrowed from
Byron
himself, who borrowed, in turn, from the
Bible:
Once more upon the watersyet once more,
And the waves bound beneath me, as a steed,
That knows his rider.
F4
Pollock, I am half disposed to think, has improved
upon the original. But, turn your eyes from the
sea, my son. Look back upon our ocean hamlet,
as
our
poet properly calls it. How sweetly does
it sleep in the cold light of the dawn. The outline
of the settlement seen in the imperfect light,
actually
looms up nobly and picturesquely. The
rudeness
of the exterior is not perceptible; and one
might fancy that a proper architecture had been at
work to address the most elaborate appeals to the
eye. But, hark! What is that? It sounds like a
regular war whoop!
Editor
.It is, and it is from the throat of
Pictor
.
He learned the war whoop among the
Choctaws
.
Abbot
.But why does he gives it to us now.
It is surely a signal. It must mean something.
Where is he?
Editor
.Down, close under the shadow of the
breakwater.
Abbot
.I see! and hark, again! Look! he
waves his hand toward the shore. What can he
mean?
Editor
.By Jove, Father, we are not alone.
There is another party within the basin. They do
not see us. Should they be ladies now.
Abbot
.I see! Three tall forms, muffled up
like the witches in Macbeth. They wave their
hands also. Thrice to thine!
Editor
.And thrice to mine!
Abbot
.And thrice again to make up nine.
Can they be women? Or only of that breed,
Desinit
in piscem, mulier formosa superne?
Should
they be women, that fellow Beauclerk is in a pretty
fix.
Editor
.They may be mermaids, in sooth.
They are too tall for women.
Abbot
.----They only seem tall in this light, and
standing up, as they do, in shallow water. They
are women, I am certain!and there go
Beauclerk
and the Poet, in full plunge, toward them.
In their trial of skill and speed, they see nothing
but one another. See what tremendous
splurges
that fellow, Beauclerk, makes. Little does he
dream who sees his antics. How wantonly he
darts, and skims, and wallowshalf the time out
of water:and, now, only look at the blind, the
utterly besotted, mortals. They have actually
begun to splash away, like overgrown urchins, at
each other's faces, making every thing foam about
them.
Editor
.Beauclerk is beaten, and the Poet
pursues him.
Abbot
.And there they rush, by all that's
gracious
,
directly among the strangers. We shall
soon see whether they are women or not. Ha!
We have it! what a shriek! Push for the shore,
my son. Keep within the shadow of the
break-water
,
and let us make away toward the Point
House. We may yet escape unseen. Pictor is
ahead of us, moving in the same direction. See,
how the strangers scamper. They tumble
headlong
,
one over the other, toward the beach; while
our naked athletes push, equally headlong, in the
opposite quarter.
Editor
.The Poet has his drawers on, Father.
F5
Abbot
.A fig for his drawers! He might as
well be as naked as a Pict. His drawers stick to
him like a pitch plaister, shewing the beauties of
his form in all its absolute perfection. Ho! there,
you runagates! What a mischief have you done!
Beauclerk
.All your fault, Father.
Abbot
.My fault, monster!
Beauclerk
.Yes, Father, the ambition to show
off before you, led us into this misfortune.
Abbot
.Hence, infidel! To the house with all
despatch, and into your breeches. We shall steal
away, and take our breakfast at the East end of
the island. There is a friend who keeps good
cheer in that quarter, who will gladly welcome us.
The storm will blow ever in our absence. In
flight alone is safety. `
Sauve qui pent
,' is the cry.
Editor
.We breakfast then with ?
Abbot
.Yes! And see his farm and dairy.
His cows, his calves, his pigs, his poultry, his ox,
his ass, and every thing that is his. He affords a
happy instance of a man, brought up to business
cares in a city, who has a taste for nature, and
whose humanity has never been corrupted by a
selfish
occupation.
Beauclerk
.Do we ride, Father?
Abbot
.Get yourself into your garments! Ask
no questions! Join us on the back-beach. We
walk! It will help digestion. A long walk after
the bath, and a good breakfast after that, and a wise
man is a happy one for the day. He is then more
apt to realize that condition of sound mind in sound
body
means sana in corpore sano
which is the
very perfection of humanityin its capacity for
enjoyment, at least.
Editor
.Beauclerk, you should never have
gone in without your drawers and shirt.
Abbot
.A grave truth, just one hour too late.
But we must enforce and make the caution a
permanent
one in his mind by a proper penalty. Let
the decree be registered against him;a basket of
champagne.
Beauclerk
.A hard case, Father. But is it
understood that we invite our mermaids to sup
with us?
Abbot
.Out Polyphemus, out! before I couch
thy sight for thee with a staff as potent as that of
Ulysses. Away, Centaur, and get thyself clad.
Editor
.This is a mischance, Father.
[
Abbot
.Yes, if it chance that there shall have
been a miss among these strangers; but between
us, son, you may make your mind easy. These
are no women, but our own brethren, Beaurevoir,
Bienami, and Beauregard, who came down in a
sail boat late last night, and came to my chamber
as I was about to retire. I wished to give
Beauclerk
a scare, in order to curb his tendency to
excess. The thing was arranged with our
brethren
who will join us, on the way to breakfast.
Editor
.I breathe, Father. I am relieved.
Had they been women!
Abbot
.Pshaw!had they been
ladies
, the
affair would have been a little annoying, but
nothing more. To the pure, all things are pure,
and keeping in mind the phrase of the King in
regard
to the Countessof whom, by the way,
nothing need be saidwe must, in all such cases,
find our security in the motto,----
Honi soit qui
mal y pense
. But let us away, and leave the
boys to follow.
IX.
Abbot
.There comes the sun! He is just
struggling above the waters. How like a struggle
it appears! The effect, at this moment, conducts
irresistibly to this impression. The waves seem
to rise about him, laboring to keep him down.
They have lashed themselves into foam in the
endeavor
,
and though they fail in their object, yet it
would seem that his victory has not been won
without loss. His wounds seem to have dyed the
torrents with his blood. The crimson and the
white foam mingle together; and we fancy that
were we near enough to hear, we should be
stunned
by the howls of disappointment on the one
hand, and the shouts of victory on the other. We
hear the murmur of billows even here; and it seems
to be allied to the conflict, and to have been
occasioned
by it. The coulds have shared somewhat
in the affair. They wear the hues of blood also.
One great and reptured mass hangs directly above
the head of the conqueror. It is the smoke
reeking
up from the field of fight, rising above, and
forming its appropriate canopy. The sun employs
it as a trophy. It becomes his banner; and its torn
and tattered edges are spread out, and rise with
him, as if borne aloft by the tallest of his angel
legions
some
Azazel of the imperial host! Other
banners now appear along the horizon, as if rising
with him from the deep; forming a grand
procession
to accompany his onward march. And see,
those pale white groups of cloud, flitting fast
away, right and left, as remotely as possible from
his line of marcha wild and capricious disarray.
May we not suppose them to be the scattered camps
of some auxiliary host, flying confusedly to escape
destruction or captivity. The whole broad
expanse
of heaven exhibits as many contrasts and
varieties of shape and shadow, in the advance of
the morning splendor, as any field of various
conflict
,
or any country under the march of a dreaded
conqueror. It would seem as if the hosts of night
and ocean, assembled under the cover of darkness
for the conquest of the earth, had been dispersed
by a single glance from some glorious messenger
of heaven.
Editor
.You make quite a picture, Father.
Abbot
.It makes itself. This is one of those
spectacles that convert all men, more or less, into
painters. The mind catches from the prospect, a
thousand suggestions for the fancy, and the eye
looks forth for pictures. But the sunrise is not
simply a spectacle. It is a moral emblem. We
see the great invisible work of creation performed
anew with the return of every day. We see the
results of the Almighty working, as at the dawn
of all mortal being, though the process is wholly
hidden from our eyes. We see in the glorious
spectacle the moral that is designed to excite our
emulation. The day of man is a march in light.
It is a constant progress forward. It rises in
night, to have its setting in other regions, which
it is to enliven and illumine also. We pass on
from world to world; with an active duty
assigned
to us in each. He only is the true Christian,
who goes on working and marching to the close.
In this way only can he unfold his possessions,
and bless other eyes with that
trust of light
, which
is conferred upon him for this very purpose.
Happy he who obeys the law of his nature as
implicitly
as the sun! Who rises regularly to his
duties, and, heedless of storm, and strife, and
temporary
obscuration by cloud, vapor, and
interposing
and envious bodies, still keeps in his old path,
the ordered course pursuing.
Editor
.Is not that last member a quotation,
Father? I think I have heard the phrase before.
Abbot
.---Doubtlessly. It is a quotation from a
version which I made twenty years ago of Goethe's
famous Hymn of the Archangels, at the opening
of the Faust. It suits the scene, and you shall
have it all.
HYMN OF THE ARCHANGELS.
RAPHAEL.
And still the sun as ever,
Chimes with his brother spheres,
His order'd path pursuing,
With the thunder's solemn roll
Though him we may not fathom,
He yet gives strength to us
Glorious, oh! mighty Father,
Thy works, as at the first!
GABRIEL.
And with a mighty fleetness,
The pomp of earth revolves;
The glorious blaze of Heaven,
Now chang'd for fearful night;
The broad waves of the ocean
Foam up against the rocks,
While whirling on, both rock and sea
Chime with the ever rolling spheres.
MICHAEL.
And roaring as in rivalry,
From sea to land, from land to sea,
The storms erect around a chain
Of deepest elemental rage;
And flashing desolation there
Glares in the thunder's rushing path
But, Lord! thy messengers revere
The milder goings of thy day.
THE THREE.
Though Thee we may not fathom,
Thy look gives strength to us
Glorious, oh! mighty Father,
Thy works, as at the first!
Editor
.I wished you had rhymed it, Father.
Abbot
.So do I. I shall rhyme it some day
when I am in the mood, and have the leisure; but
there are some subjects for verse which rhyme
does not seem to improve. Sacred poetry, for
example
,
always appears to me to lose something of
dignity and solemnity, by the petty tagging of the
rhyme. To pursue our moral analogies: it
matters
not to man, keeping his natural symbols in his
sight, that his light may sometimes, nay,
frequently
,
fail to be seen, by those for whom it is
designed
,
and who are supposed to look for it. Enough
that he can reply with the magician in the
mysterious
cave of the Visigoth:
I do mine office!
It is quite sufficient that he wilfully withholds no
portion of his precious beams. It is the
misfortune
and the error of those who wilfully refuse to
see.
Editor
.Yet unless they see, Father, where is
his recompense; where their acknowledgments?
Abbot
.His ample recompense lies in his own
exercise, if his ambition be the right one: looking
to the only proper source of reward. Shall man
look ever and only to his brother; and what shall
be the virtue in his charity, if he is perpetually
groaning for the
quid pro quo?
Genius is the
world's great benefactor. Shall it cease to be
genius because the world is ungrateful; and shall
the benefactor look to the pauper for his pay. What
is it to the noble----which is always the giving and
the performing mind----that his petty puling race,
each cursing himself and his neighbor with his
miserable little two-and-sixpence vanities, his small
conceit of place and position, and the strut which
is always laboring, not to be high, but to seem
high----stubbornly refuses to acknowledge the
benefits
of the benefactor----in the powerful phrase of
Milton, crams and blasphemes the feeder, and
decries the claim, which it feels that it can never
satisfy? Nay, what were the real value of the
tribute of acknowledgment, were the world to
make free and full confession of the benefits
received
?
Would that be sufficiently compensative
for the performance, which still strives, and serves,
and saves? It is not intended that it should be!
The essence of compensation to man, for good and
great works upon earth, is to be found in the
performance
itself
. This is the principle of vitality in
the moral system. It is in the feeling that he does,
is doing, and has done, that the worker finds his
reward, in all moral and intellectual labors. This,
indeed, constitutes the secret of his dignity. He
is the master of a world-wide charity. The sense
of a gratified obedience, in the heart of man, is the
source, not only of the
mens conscia recti
, but of
the higher rewards of a justifiable ambition.
Milton
alludes to this, when he says in Lycidas:
`But not the praise,'
Phbus replied, and touch'd my trembling ear;
`Fame is no plant that grows in mortal soil.'
No! we fulfil a destiny, my son. The duty must
be performed; and it is not to man that we are to
look ever, for the reward of the worker. The sense
of duty done, and grief endured, without
complaint
and in a cheerful, sanguine spirit, naturally
directs the eye of the laborer to the great Giver of
all endowments, and assures him of ultimate
acknowledgment
,
in the shape of continued and
higher employment hereafter. In other words,
though the Prophet toils for man, he toils in the
employ of God. To which ought he to look for
reward?
Editor
.What new and hopeful prospects does
such a view open to those who seem to toil in vain.
G
How it unfolds the vista of hope to labor and art.
Abbot
.Necessarily! Man belongs to a
system
,
even as the sun, the moon and stars. With
greater discretion allowed him, he is subject to
laws which are quite as exacting in degree.
His
simple duty is obedience
. In obedience lies the
whole secret of his usefulness; and usefulness,
understood
in its enlarged and proper sense, covers
the entire tract of Christian obligation.
Editor
.Is there not some danger, Father,
from such a doctrine? Does it not tend greatly
to narrow the province of humanity? What will
become of our friends, Poet and Painter, if we
establish the utilitarian principle on such an
eminence
?
Abbot
.You do not give due value to the words
I use. I am not arguing for the
vulgar
doctrine
of utilitarianism. I said
usefulness
, in its enlarged
and
proper
sense, in which the Poet, in all
probability
,
occupies the highest position as a social
benefactor. He is the father of the profoundest
philosophy. He speaks for our noblest nature.
His very language belongs to a condition which
humanity may understand and feel, but cannot
ordinarily
use. As one of the tribe has described
itis the large utterance of the early gods! It
is a divine speech, worthy of prophecy and
inspiration
in
which true inspiration has usuallynay
alwaysspoken.
Editor
.But all the studies and labors of the
great body of mankind, will fail to endow them
with this utterance
Poeta nascitur non fit!
What
then becomes of its usefulness?
Abbot
.It lies partly in this very particular.
It is at once desirable and unattainable. It is not
intended
that the world at large should speak this
language. It is enough if the world is content to
hear and take it to their hearts. If men were all
poets and prophets there would be no men.
Humanity
would be advanced, at a bound, to one of
those higher conditions, which it may be supposed
to be designed to reach, only through long ages of
probationtoils ceaseless, and humiliations that
purge pride of all its grossnesses. We are
permitted
to hear and comprehend this language of
the poet, and this is all. Enough if we
acknowledge
its diviner impulses; if, freeing our souls, at
moments, from the miserable toils and vulgar
anxieties
which form the clogs to the soul's progress
upon earth, we occasionally give ear to the pure
harmonies of the poet, while he soothes the stormy
ocean around us, and subdues to repose the vexed
and vexing billows of passion in our hearts. Our
merit will be quite sufficient, if we incline our ears
to the poet without seeking to emulate his song;
enough if we comprehend the divine utterance
which we cannot hope to imitate. Still we may
yearn to employ this speech. It is desirable that
we should. It is desirable as a motive to honorable
ambition
Fame is the spur which the clear spirit doth raise
To scorn delights,
that we should seek to speak this language; and,
for another reasonthat, as it is unattainable by
G2
the unendowed, it should leave us always
discontents
.
Editor
.And is discontent, Father, a desirable
condition for humanity?
Abbot
.----The most desirable of all! The very
condition which constitutes the lot of man on earth.
It is through this condition only that he finds the
usual stimulus to performance. Were it not for
this he would
do
nothing and
be
nothing. We
prattle a great deal very absurdly about content;
and what is hope itself but a happy sort of
discontent
?
It tells us of unattained objects and
conditions
,
and so paints their attractions to our mind,
that we naturally yearn and strive for their
acquisition
;
and hence our best performances. Man,
as an inhabitant of earthas manwas never
meant to be satisfied with his condition. He is
still evermore afflicted with aspirations after the
possiblethe vaguethe, perhaps, unattainable!
In this yearning he establishes his ideal; and the
pursuit of his ideal affords the clue to his
existence
.
It is thus that he works out his deliverance.
It is thus that he finds out and exercises his
powers
;
and shows what are his highest conceptions
of the Deity, as well as of his own nature. The
Mahometan's dream of Heaven, for example, is
one of sensual delights and physical repose. He
dreams that he shall sleep in Heaven, on couches
of amaranth, tended by houri'sbeings of celestial
origin, but meant as ministers to the faithful among
the sons of earth. He is not tasked with cares,
nor required to serve. He does not even engage
in hosannas to a common sovereign. All his being
lapses away in dream and reverie, and the
gratification
of simply voluptuous fancies, without
physical
effort. At most, he amuses himself with
archery, which the Prophet seems to have exulted
in as a practice of delight almost too good for
earth! But, with the Christian philosopher, the
future is a world for struggle and conquest, the
same as this; for exercise and continual
achievement
,
for which the present is a mere ordeal and
preparation. I say Christian
philosopher
, mark
you, and not Christian simply. I am afraid
that too many professing Christians look
forward
to a Heaven, in which, if the delights
be not sensual exactly, they are yet designed
to minister to the desire of ease, and repose
from struggles, which always made them groan
and grumble under their fardels, throughout the
preliminary state, as a very much ill-used
people
.
This was certainly the Puritan philosophy,
with a difference. They were too much given to
insist upon themselves as the suffering Saints,
having
title to, if not tenure of, the Lord's possessions
upon the earth, to forego, at any time, the free use
of its fruits in their season. We all seek our ideals,
and, in so doing, declare the degree of elevation in
our thoughts and sensibilities. The world knows
no higher ideals than those of the poet. If we
give him our ear, he invariably conducts us out of
the present. That is something. He lifts us from
the earth. That is something more. He thus
weans us from the pleasures of the sense, and raises
us up from the wallow into which the brutal parts
G3
of our nature would constantly conduct us. In
this lies
one
secret, and not the largest of his
usefulness
.
This is enough for us; and, in the
employment
of this influence the poet shares with us
his nature and his gifts. The natural tendency,
struggling as we do, with petty daily necessities,
and against special social vanities, is continually
downward. The fine arts, of which poetry is the
most supreme, are perpetually interposing to
arrest
or to modify this tendency. In this office they
are potent handmaids of religion, which has at
heart this object only; and even when serving us
simply through the tastes, they operate wonderful
results in behalf of the higher objects of the soul.
You are passing now two of the churches upon
the Island. Is religion aided in her objects, think
you, when the passer by smiles, or sneers, at the
dwelling to which we implore the presence of
Jehovah
?
Our tastes should no more be allowed to
contemn, in religious matters, than our philosophy.
We can understand why a temple of God, in a
small community like this, need not be a massive,
or of immense structure. But surely, society
should not allow itself to be in possession of any
arts superior to those with which she builds to her
Creator. If you lack the material for building,
the money, or the architect, why, then, the excuse
for a wretched temple is legitimate. But where
you possess the means, and where you have the
necessary arts, such structures as these are not only
discreditable to our tastes, but to our religion. In
other words, we employ a superior art in the
erection
of a stable or a kitchen, to that which we
summon
to our service in rearing the temples of the
Lord. You require
Him
to occupy a dwelling in
which you would not deign to reside yourself. I
have alluded to the expense of a good structure.
I need not to have done so. It is just as cheap to
build a good, as a bad structure. The same
money
which has been expended on these buildings,
with the usual expense of repairs upon them, for
ten years past, would have put up pleasing and
graceful edifices, to which the eye of taste would
incline, as well as religion. To build
symmetrically
,
and according to the laws of art, is not
necessarily
to build expensively. To make a
fine
house, seldom costs more than to make an
atrocious
one!
This is the secret of art! She builds
economically because she wastes nothing. She
builds securely and durably, because she builds
symmetrically
. The secret of strength is quite as
much in the
symmetry
of the structure as in its
materials. It is to this that we owe the wonderful
preservation of so many monuments of ancient art,
which have been preyed upon by storm, siege, fire
the wilful assaults of man, and the corroding
and sapping influences of time. The building
gains nothing in strength, from the enormous bulk
of the mass. A well sprung arch will tie the
granite
together in bonds which neither storm nor
fire can rend asunder, but it must be the hands of
art which must forge the bolts for their union.
We have been accustomed to leave these matters
to the mechanic. But the mechanic seldom aims,
or pretends to be an architect. He has quite
enough to do in carrying out the plans of the
architect
.
G4
We have buildings among uschurches
which contain unnecessary brick enough to wall
the city! Some of our towers were made so
massive
with brick, as to split and crack, and sink,
and cave in, and yawnleaving the proprietors
doubtful whether the foundation would endure its
own weight, to say nothing of that of the spire
which it was designed to sustain! It was very
easy to respect such a doubt, and to forbear
all further experiments, when it was found that the
money, raised for the steeple, was all consumed in
the foundation. You perhaps recall the doggrel
which sang of a
Christian people,
Who built a Church in Meeting-street,
But could'nt raise the steeple.
The Church alluded to, has, of late years,
repaired
its short comings. But we still see others about
the citycrude, unfinished monstrosities of
architecture
discrediting
equally taste and religion
without plan or purposesymmetry or strength
great barn-like fabrics, with porches and pediments
that seemed to have been fashioned after an
awkward
squad of revolutionary officers, six portly
legs and pursy bodies, with one great sharp cock'd
hat upon the heads of the entire line. I repeat, it
is just as
easy
and
cheap
to build a fine fabric, in
good style, according to proper laws of taste, as to
build a mean one; and that the secret of
durableness
consists much more in the symmetry and just
proportions of the structure, than in the materials
which you employ. A house, for example, of soft
and inferior brick, well planned, well covered,
with ample eaves and cornice, and plaistered or
stuccoed, will last just as long as the same
building
made of the best brick, and finished in the same
manner. Nay, it will last much longer, indeed, if
while the proportions of the former be in
accordance
with the laws of art, the latter issues from
the hands of a hodman in the business.
Editor
.I am curious, Father, about the new
Hotel on the Island. I confess to great anxiety as
to its establishment.
Abbot
.Be at ease on the subject. It will be
built. It will be done effectually, and in proper
manner. I have enjoyed an hour of
prevision
, my
sona peculiar faculty, you are aware, which I
possesswhich enables me to satisfy all your
doubts, and to soothe all your anxieties. I can
give you the whole particulars relating to the
Island
House, though nothing has yet been resolved
upon. But all will happen as I tell you. We
will wait till our scape-graces come upI see
them now approachingwhen you shall have the
full history of the Hotel, its site, its style, its
extent
,
and all that belongs to the subject. In the
meantime, before I forget, let me remind you of
something which was said in a previous
conversation
,
in regard to the tenure by which lots are held
on the Island. It was then assumed that the grant
was from O'Sullivan. This may be so; yet, in the
absence of proof, it is well to know what old Jack
Drayton says on the subject. You will find at
page 206 of his View, a paragraph which states
that the first settlement of Moultrieville was about
the year 1791, when the Legislature passed a
resolution
permitting people to build there on half
acre lots; subject, however, to the condition of
being removed whenever demanded by the
Governor
or Commander-in-Chief. Of course, this
contemplates nothing more than the exigencies
which might follow from invasion; when it might
be necessary to convert the whole island into a
fortress. The eastern extremity, which was
threatened
when Sir Peter Parker assailed Fort
Moultrie
,
should certainly have its defences also.
Drayton mentions further, that the island was at
one time well wooded, and continued so till the
year 1700, when, by an act of Assembly, the trees
were cut down; a few prominent ones excepted,
which were left standing as marks for pilots.
What motive could have prompted this
proceeding
,
seemingly so barbarous, is not said. Drayton
refers to Trott's Laws, p. 81, where probably the
preamble of the act affords the motive. Invasions
from French and Spaniards were common about
that period, and Pirates frequently made the coast,
its inlets, creeks, and marshes, their secret places
of resort. They might well have sheltered the
masts and spars of their little crafts, behind a clump
of forest trees, invisible from the city, whence,
were there presence suspected, they might have
been pursued, or signals given to the unsuspecting
merchantmen, approaching the shore, for whom
they lay in wait. The commerce of Charleston
suffered dreadfully from these marauders, whom,
under irresponsible administrations, her people had
rather encouraged. You are aware, perhaps, that
the Pirates walked the streets of that good city
with impunity, not only tolerated, but in favor
with the people.
Editor
.Is it possible?
Abbot
.The secret was this. The Pirates
were good Britons. They preyed only on the
Spanish galleons, and filled their beakers only
from the wines of the French Islands. They were,
therefore, our natural allies. The French and
Spaniards were, in that day, our natural enemies.
Charleston encouraged the pirates, as Queen
Elizabeth
did; and for the same reason. Her
mariners
held the doctrine, that there was no peace
beyond the Line; and the cavaliers of Carolina
esteemed this doctrine to be not a bad one, in a
period when an English Monarch knighted
Morgan
,
the Buccaneer. Subsequently, however,
when the British Government, threatened equally
by France and Spain, was compelled to frown
down the piracies practised in her name in the
seas of America, South-Carolina was made to pay
the penalty of the eccentricities in morals of the
mother country. The Pirates who were denied to
enter the port which once received them
graciously
,
became its bitter assailantswatched its
entrances
day and night, carried off its rich
merchandizes
,
and more than once laid the city itself
under contribution. Remind me at a moment of
greater leisure of this matter, and I will tell you
some curious pirate traditions of these very islands.

Mine Host
.Venerable Father, and you,
Reverend
Brethren, I pray ye consider yourselves at
home. Hold me as a serving brother only, and
command accordingly. These fish are the very
best that swimat least to my notion. They are
the Cavalli. Here is butter, fresh from my own
poor dairy; and these eggs were laid, according
to instructions, the moment I heard of your coming.
My hens have had their training. I find them as
docile as my neighbor, Truesdell, finds his oysters.
Here, also, are some cream cheeses, the receipt for
preparing which is peculiar. I procured it from a
traveller who brought it from Bagdad. It had
there the traditional reputation of having been the
favorite dish of the famous Caliph, Haroun
Al-Raschid
.
Of course, I have not omitted hominy.
That dish I hold to be the
sine qu non
in a
Carolina
breakfast. But this is prepared of no common
corn. It is from a peculiar grain called the silver
eye. I beg that you will say nothing of it to John
Michel, or h'll be for crossing and improving it.
Now, I have a weakness in regard to this grain.
I do not wish its virtues perilled by any
experiments
.
It may undergo change, indeed, and that
change may be improvement; but my taste is now
so admirably accommodated to the commodity, as
it is, that I fear I should suffer some loss of
appetite
,
were I conscious of any variation in its flavor.
These rice waffles I can commend to you, and the
flappers and griddle cakes. Estifania, my
housekeeper
,
has a rare capacity in breadstuffs. She is
the very flower of my household.
Abbot
.Blessed is the woman that hath the
approbation of her master! Such a being is not
to be carved out of common wood. I can believe
all her merits. My nostrils agreeably confirm all
the impressions of mine eyes. You have made
princely provision for us, Mine Host, and you have
our blessings. The gods keep your larder always
full, your fowls always prolific, and your wine
always
ripe, cool, and abundant. Receive from my
paternal hands the badge of our order.
Mine Host
.Holy Father! This is too much.
It is overwhelming! I had never dreamed of such
proud distinction.
Abbot
Modesty is the jewel of youth. Look
up, my son, and take heart. It is well to feel
humility
,
but not to sink under it. Henceforth, be
known to the order as Brother Bonhommie! Our
tenets and faith shall be opened to you at the first
solemn chapter which we hold hereafter. For the
present, Brother, do thine office. The Cavalli, if
you please. You do no less than justice to this
hominy, which you are right in assuming to be the
essential on a Southern breakfast table. Maize is
one of the noblest of the breadstuffs. We owe
something to the red men for that which we
inherit
from them. That you have improved upon it,
by judicious culture and selection, is to your own
honor. It is the curse of too many of our
planters
,
of the Low Country, that they do not attend
to their own farmsteads. What can the overseer
know where the master knows nothing? This
absenteeismthis wandering off into distant and
ungrateful Stateswasting profligately, in foreign
expenditure, the substance drawn ruthlessly from
the bowels of our ownis a crime no less than a
folly! Our misfortunes are almost wholly due to
this single cause; for the practice not only involves
us in a waste of substance, but a waste of time,
which is more valuable still. The waste of time
involves all sorts of wastes, not the least of which
is the waste of intellect. No man's mind can
possibly
improve, who has no habitual occupation.
All progress fails in the community, or with the
class which devolves its duties wholly on
subordinates
.
Editor
.But, Father, the climate of our Low
Country,so fatal to the white race.
Abbot
.I have not lost sight of this matter, my
son. There is something in it, but not every thing.
Many need not leave their homesteads at all; and
many need not go far. Settlements are to be found
within ten miles of almost every rice plantation in
the Low Country, where the summer might be
passed in healthy security. But look at those who
come to Charlestonand the Island. Need they
be idle because they leave their plantations?
Could they not do as has been done here, by our
worthy brother, Bonhommie? Surely, there is
nothing in the native character of
this
soil, but
sterility
;
yet, what has art and industry already
achieved for this isolated spot! Here has he
snatched from the desert a pretty little cantle. He
hath made the wilderness to blossom as the rose.
With honest pride, and parental pleasure, doth he
behold his pigs and his poultry. See how his
peafowls
,
and his turkies, his ducks and his chickens
throng about his footsteps as he approaches. Even
those chickens, which, in the earliest stages of their
growth, exhibit but downy and unfeathered
extremities
,
they have a chirp of welcome and
affection
for the hand that scatters forth the pea and
grist to them at night, and noon, and morning.
Verily, Brother Bonhommie hath reason to be
happy. He is a benefactor to the inferior. But his
boast is larger still, when he casts his eye over his
little territory and sees its increase. With what
pride doth he behold his fields smiling in green
and grainhis mammoth pumpkins, of a rich
golden
yellow, rolling about among his hillocks, like
so many great turtles on the beach, turned over
by the captors, and showing their yellow bellies to
the sun. See him, as we did this morning on our
arrival, thrusting his fingers into his potato beds,
to assure himself of the dimensions of his yams!
Hear him discourse of the cabbage and
cauliflower
,
in his own domain, as of treasures which, some
day, should emulate those of Dr. Bachman and
Captain, Paine; and while he points out his
cornfield
,
his eye glistens with the secret hope which
inspires him to persevere in the laudable ambition
to rivel Michel, in making his hundred and five
bushels of flint to the acre!
Bonhommie
.Oh! Father, such praise!
Abbot
.Nay, blush not, my son. Thou hast
done much in thy day and generation. Thy
brethren
will be careful of thy fameit is a common
property. Suppose, now, that our worthy
planters
,
who have left their plantations on the plea of
malaria
, had gotten themselves little farmsteads on
the Neck, or in St. Andrew's, to which they could
have gone daily, and there perfected themselves in
the knowledge of their vocation by daily and
diligent
toils and studies, trying all manner of easy
experiments under the guidance of thought and
science, how different would have been their
fortunes
,
and how much more beautiful and
prosperous
the country! Look at the scene now between
Line-street and the Four Mile House: what a
garden
has it become within the last ten years.
Twenty
years ago the greater part of it was a common,
the farms mostly abandoned as worn out and
exhausted
.
What blathering stupidity is in such a
phrase. It is not possible for us to exhaust the
earth's resources, even should we try. It is true,
that a culture the most wretched, and a system the
most wasteful and improvident, did all that could
be done towards this unhappy consummation. But
the thing was impossible. The earth cannot fail
us. To the industrious man it was given for an
eternal heritage. It has sustained a thousand
generations
which have gone before himit will
sustain
thousands of generations which are to follow
after him. The long tract of ages, countless and
unfathomable, behind and before us, dazzles the
imagination and defeats the judgment. We are
bewildered with the vain attempt to enumerate the
various races which have risen from and sunk into
that almighty bosom; which have fed at its
exhaustless
granaries, and which will continue to
find ample provision upon its surface to the very
crack of doom. There is no such thing as
exhausting
the earth. You may impoverish it by
barbarous cultivation, and profligate waste; but
leave it to itself, fly from it, surrender it once more
to its Creator, and lo! the event of a single season.
The grass comes forth from the eternal principle
of germination which is everywhere intact and
indestructible. The trees re-appear, and cover
and beautify its surface. The work of decay
which goes on annually among their leaves, suffices
to refresh and reinvigorate the soil upon which
they perish; and the new forest which once more
protects it from the sun, proves the munificence
of God, which thus wondrously repairs the
wastefulness
of man. These few truths prove every
thing. It is enough for us that they prove one
thing:
that he will reap who sows, and reap only
as he sows; that labor, governed by thought, will
effectually keep the earth from exhaustion; and
that cultivation, so far from impoverishing, if
judiciously
managed, must always improve the soil
.
Bonhommie
.I believe it: I
know
it, Father.
See to the mountain of sedge which I have
gathered
for manure. The late gale brought me in, to
the very edge of my enclosure, as much as I can
haul and gather in the next six weeks. I feel sure
that a man who makes manure of good quality, in
abundance, may make a soil what he pleases, and
raise every thing upon it.
Abbot
.No doubt of it, my son; and the
process
is comparatively an easy one. In fact, I regard
agriculture as really the simplest and most obvious
of all artsas really teaching its own processes,
H
inevitablyif the heart of the cultivator goes with
his occupation, as it should in every business.
There was surely nothing either very mysterious
or very intricate, in the labors which were required
by the Deity at the hands of man. In the sweat
of his browsuch was the simple form of that
decree which was to be the elementary law of his
existencehe was to earn his bread. Whether
easy of compliance, or not, no law could have been
more obvious and simple; and even now, perverted
by evil counsellors, and misled, as we have been,
by false lights and vitiating habits, it appears to me
that a prompt return to its provisions will bring
back the fertility to our fields, and prosperity to
our homesteads. No books are needed for the
tuition of those who obey this law. No recondite
sciences need to be explored. That degree of
observation
and thought, which are the inevitable
fruit of industry, will bring us more knowledge in
a single season, than can be gleaned from all the
heavy volumes ever yet written by grave and
scholastic self-sufficiency. Experience, says the
Roman poet, whose moral maxims for the
agriculturist
should be got by heart by every planter,
Experience best forelearns
Where best to sow, where best to reap, discerns.
In the earth itself, the teacher and the treasure
lie buried together. The ancients did not vainly
fable, when they proclaimed Plutus to be the god
of the subterranean regions. There, in truth, he
sits, enthroned amid the equal splendors of his
metalic
,
his mineral and his vegetable worlds.
We
have only to dig for his possessions
.
Editor
.But, Father, you would not exclude
book learning in agriculture?
Abbot
.I exclude no
learning
in
anything
,
where learning would be useful. But first assure
me that it
is
learning, and not the vain
speculations
of those who do all their planting in their
writings, and never in their fields;who
undertake
to teach others, without being successful
themselves. I say to the planter, as I say to all
the arts and professionsget knowledge wherever
you can find it. But how much knowledge, of a
truly valuable kind, can you get by the common
course among us of asking questions. You concur
with a man who complains of hard times and an
unprofitable staple, and he straightway calls upon
you to tell him what he shall do. How unmanly
and unbecoming it is that people should be running
hither and thither from their fields, asking counsel,
in their own professions, from those who are no
older than themselves. A man who has been
brought up a planter, should know his own
business
surely. Let him put his questions honestly
and manfully to the soil itself, and I guarantee that
he will never want an answer long. It is not
denied
that a good farmer may occasionally receive
information from his neighbor; but a good farmer
is one who will seldom need to inquire; and the
principle which we would inculcate, is the one
equally broad and simple, that a devout and
undivided
attention to one's own interests, will be the
best mode of learning how to conduct them. It is
H2
so, not in planting, simply; but in every thingin
all the trades, professions and occupations of life.
Agriculture is one of many arts, all of which, so
far as they relate to their professors, have the same
governing laws. The planter must be prepared by
a continual study of the plant itself; he must first
learn the nature of the soil which it loves; the
temperature which delights it; the degree of
shadow
or sunlight which it needs, or can endure;
and adapt the soil to the plant, and both, as well
as he may, to the fluctuations of the seasons. Virgil
teaches this doctrine in more elevated language:
Ere virgin earth first feels th' invading share,
The genius of the place demands thy care;
The culture, clime, the winds and changeful skies,
And what each region bears and what denies.
How little of this knowledge can one obtain
from his neighbors. How much by a patient and
dutiful attention to his own fields, and by a
constant
exercise of his thoughts upon the result of
his observations. This course alone can teach him
what it is necessary for him to know. No man
ever yet became a good planter, or a good
anything
,
from asking questions; for, indeed, such a
person, like Pontius Pilate, though he asks for the
truth, is seldom willing to wait for the answer.
Our oracle must arise from the earth, like all other
oracles; and let no man fear, if he knocks with a
strong arm, and with proper courage, at the door
of that ancient temple, that he will knock vainly,
and without profit. The answer will be such, we
warrant him, as will amply satisfy any reasonable
mortal. Pass me those waffles, if you please.
Bonhommie
.Father, we have a bushel of fine
oysters, which Truesdell, hearing of your arrival,
has sent over with his compliments. Shall we
have a few of them roasted?
Abbot
.No, I pray you; so far as I am
concerned
,
let them be kept for dinner. Our brethren
must answer for themselves.
Omnes
.For dinner, surely.
Abbot
.You have celery, Brother Bonhommie,
in your garden?
Bonhommie
.An abundance, Father.
Abbot
.Good! Celery seems the natural
adjunct
of the oyster. I fancy, if he could choose his
vegetable, he would decide on that. By the way,
speaking of oysters, Brother Bonhommie, is any
use made of those great banks which rise out of
the water between the extremity of Haddrell's and
your Island? They seem as regularly ranged,
as if laid down by artthe moles apparently of
some ancient bridge, and on the side of Haddrell's
there seems an artificial causeway, as if meant to
facilitate a communication from shore to shore.
Bonhommie
.You are right, Father; that line of
oaks which seems striding down from Haddrell's
to the sea, indicates the line of causeway. The
tradition
is, that it was raised by Gen. Gadsden, who
built a bridge across, during the time of the
Revolution
,
in order to facilitate the escape of the
garrison
from Fort Moultrie, should it so happen that
they were overpowered by the British. I have no
doubt that the bridge did exist; for, on this side,
H3
we have a wharf to correspond with the causeway
opposite; but my faith in the other part of the
tradition
is somewhat shaken. I have not the
histories
at hand, but I believe, that, in the fight of the
28th of June, the bridge provided for the escape
of the garrison, was one entirely of boats.
Abbot
.So I think also. But the tradition
may be reconciled with the history, if you will
remember that the Fort sustained
two
actions. I
have no doubt that the bridge was really built, as
you describe it, to meet the exigencies of the
second
assault in 1780. But was it not General
Pinckney, rather than General Gadsden, who built
the bridge?
Bonhommie
.No, Sir; it was Gadsden: and
there is still extant, a lively letter of Col. Barry,
the British wit, in regard to, and ridiculing it. I
have also in my possession the extract of a letter
to Hon. George Bryan, of Pennsylvania, dated
14th March 1778, which confirms it. The writer
says, This harbour is well fortified, and
their
bridge from Sullivan's Island is an amazing work
nthing like it on the continent. It is called
Gadsden' bridge, from General Gadsden, who had
the direction of it
.
Abbot
.That should be conclusive. It is
greatly to be regretted, that we have not a bridge
there now. It would increase the securities of
the settlement, and afford the means for some
delightful
drives at Haddrell's, giving variety to the
amusements of those who find time hang heavily
on their hands at all watering places. Let us hope
when the new Hotel is built, and the Island
thronged with the wealthy and elite of our middle
and mountain country, that the old connection
between
the two places will be re-established. The
work would neither be unsafe nor expensive. The
distance is not great, and the water is
comparatively
shallow, almost too shallow for steamboats.
But let us not forget the oysters. They belong,
on those banks, to the raccoon tribe, a small long
pointed oyster, growing in immense clusters, and
sticking together with all their heads upwards,
like a close knit family of ancient Hunkers.
Beauclerk
.I am told, Father, that the
raccoon
has an appetite for them, and goes out
oytering
for himself, and hence their name. It is said
that he has the cunning to provide himself with a
number of dry sticks, which he slyly slips into
each open mouth, and the oyster perishes; the sun
bursts its valves, and the raccoon feeds at his
pleasure
.
They say also, that the oyster knows his
enemy; and sometimes, while the raccoon is busy
thrusting his stick into the jaws of one of the
family
,
another pair will open, and take in his foot or
tail. He will then be kept fast until the tide rises
and drowns him, or the sharks snatch him away.
Abbot
.Invention has been bnsy for our
benefit
in these stories. What does Brother
Bonhommie
have to say?
Bonhommie
.I have heard these stories and
many others. One of them occurs in connection
with the question of the holy Father, touching the
uses
of the raccoon oyster. Until a comparatively
recent period, they were as much eaten as any
other in our harbor. Half that were sold in our
H4
market belonged to this family. They were
gathered
chiefly by old negro women, who fished for
them in
dug-outs
. But since the Yankees took up
the business, they have driven Sally, and Sukey,
and Mimy, and Ba'sheba, pretty much out of
sight. But a succession of mighty bad scares,
contributed something towards directing the old
ladies to a safer occupation. On one occasion, a
devil-fish received the anchor, or grapnel, of one
of the boats, within the capricious vortex of his
antenn, and made off with it. It was the first
time that any of the African race had seen iron
swim. But a more serious fright was in reserve
for an old negro wench belonging to a widow lady
of Charleston. It appears that she landed at low
water on one of these oyster banks, and soon filled
her dug-out. Finding the interval short and
shallow
between that and another bank, she fastened
her boat, as she thought, securely, and waded
across the intervening space. She loitered from
one to the other; at length fell asleep upon one of
them, and was only awakened by hearing the
murmur of the waters, and feeling the surf break
over her. The space between her and the point
where she had left the dug-out, was widened to a
chasm quite impassable to one who could not swim.
The bank itself was covered; and soon the
fastening
of the boat became unloosed, and it was seen
floating high up into the marsh. The poor wretch
was in despair. The tide was still rising. The
spot of bare rock which she occupied was soon
reduced to a smple ring, which her person nearly
covered; and in a little while, the waters were
over her ancles. They continued to rise some six
inches higher; and there she stood, momently
expecting
the billows to sweep and carry her off.
They did not, however; but a new horror, as she
told it herself, shortly assailed her. Looking forth
she discovered, steadily approaching, the dorsal
fin of a shark. The voracious beast himself, was
soon visible through the water. He had seen or
scented his prey, and she watched him with all the
agonies that predict a most terrible death, as he
quietly encircled her narrow territory. She could
see his gigantic form gleaming through the waters;
and she imagined she beheld his fiery eye, gazing
with all a serpent's power of fascination, directly
into her own. She could neither scream nor
speak, nor indeed would the effort have saved her.
She could only follow his movement, wheeling
as upon a pivot, as he circled the bank. The
water was too shallow where she stood to suffer
him to approach her in that manner which alone
enables him to seize his prey. But, desperate
with inflamed appetite, he dashed at her with
a fearful plunge, which brought his head quite out
of the water, and within a foot of her person.
Then she screamed, and, in receding from his
jaws, had nearly fallen backwards into the deep.
But she recovered herself; and, shivering with
dread, continued to confront him. Again did he
slowly move about her narrow eminencetwice,
thricewith his terrible eye watching hers.
Again, desperate as before, did he rush upwards
almost to her person, his great head quite out of
the water, and his long, double range of sharp
H5
white teeth, broadly opening to snatch her into his
jaws. But he failed a second time, and drew off,
without making a third attempt, as if he had
suffered
some hurts, probably from scraping upon the
sharp oyster-beds, in those which he had made
already, But he did not abandon the spot. Still,
round and round the bank, did he perform his
constant evolutions, until the poor negro was
almost
ready to resign herself to fate, and fling
herself
into his jaws in despair. But, at this juncture,
some oyster hunters, like herself, discovered her
predicament, and came to her relief. I have heard
that she gave, in a single sentence, the whole
terrible
agony of that fearful trisl: God a'massy, I
bin dead tousand times dat day!
Editor
.When did this happen?
Bonhommie
.Oh! it was long ago! I forget
when I heard it.
Abbot
.Quite a scene, my son; and, I think,
in all probability true. The shark has been known
to rush clean out of the water, assailing a man in
a boat. It is curious he prefers white to black
meat. He will pass a negro in the water to get at
a white man. This might be in consequence of
his
seeing
the white skin more readily than the
black. It is one of the admirable advantages of
Sullivan's Island, that bathing here is so easily
rendered safe. The power of the surf itself,
secures
you from his assaults; and the surf line gives
you security against the retiring floods. On the
back beach you have no surf;but, higher up,
here, where you abide, my sonthe marsh tracts
interpose for your safety, and these creeks are at
once noble and secure bathing places. Where do
you propose to plant your oysters?
Bonhommie
.In the basin, Father, from which
you see the carts now hauling. I shall make
ample
provision, in future, for the reception of the
brotherhood. In another year, I hope to be the
father of a thriving family, which, in comeliness of
outline, plumpness of form, and sweetness of
flavor
,
shall equal those of Truesdell. But come,
Father, if you have finished. I will conduct you
through the myrtles, where we find a shady
horse-back
ride to the end of the island.
Abbot
.A moment, my son, while give thanks
and invoke a blessing.
XI.
Bonhommie
.Our horses are ready, Father, for
the canter.
Abbot
.Boots and saddles! I am ready also.
Let us mount.
Bonhommie
.We commence our ascent here,
at the foot of Prospect Hill. We have a pleasant
ride from this point, all the way to the eastern end
of the Island, through a grove of myrtles, which
affords us shade, and through which, with a little
grading and trimming up, we might have a
path-way
for a carriage The ascents are easythe
undulations, though frequent, are slight, and the
breezes of the sea gratefully fan us throughout the
progress.
Abbot
.These
are
hills. Your foreign tourist
might smile at such a designation for them; but
all things are relative; and, once familiar with the
general dead level of the Island, but little above
the sea, the eye acknowledges the dignity and
importance
of these sandy hammocks. What a
curious
spectacle do they present! Here, on one
hand, the south and southeast lie spread out, a vast
stretch of sand and sea. The plain of earth, I
suppose, extends for nearly half a mile, before it
touches the billows. Of this stretch, more than a
hundred yards at low water, is the firm and
sounding
beach. Beyond that is the great blue ocean,
spreading away into the infinite distance,
beguiling
the imagination into unknown realms and
regions. In all the space of sandy tract, on this
hand, there is not a shrub large enough to make a
toothpick. But, on the left, north and northeast,
the woods almost accumulate to a forest. The
myrtle and oak, hidden from the sea by this line of
hills, flourish in unsuspected size and numbers,
and accordingly, in security. What a deep dell
is immediately beneath our feet, in this region!
How thick the growth, how grateful is the shade!
Some of these great oaks were here long before
the battle of Fort Moultrie; coeval, probably,
with the first European knowledge of the Island.
Here the Pirates may have frequently harbored
here they may have buried their treasure in secret.
You are aware in what manner they usually
guarded their buried treasure, and to what
terrible
superstitions they appealed to make it safe?
Bonhommie
.I cannot say that I am, Father.
Abbot
.They led some wretched captive to
the spot in the depths of midnight. They chose
the place of safe-keeping by the gloomy light of
glaring torches. The hole was dug, not only
large enough for their treasure, but for the captive.
The treasure was deposited; and the sudden shot
or axe, or sabre stroke, slew the victim upon it.
If they had no captive, some one of their own
number
some
incompetent, timid, or offensive
member
was
butchered in his place. The victim was
sometimes an unsuspecting boya youth, eager to
win their favor, and totally ignorant of the bloody
treacheries which distinguished the infernal
brotherhood
.
The question was put in vague
language
:
Who is willing to stay and watch the
treasure? When the poor simpleton replied by
a profession of readiness to do so, the answer was
immediately accompanied with the sudden stab or
shot: Stay then, till we call for it, and see that
you watch it well! He was tumbled into the
receptacle, and his sleepless ghost became the
keeper of the treasure. It was the presence of
this watchful spectre, that, in all the attempts of
which we read, to recover the buried treasure of
the Pirates, opposed his supernatural authority to
the labors of the seeker; and defeated his
operations
,
seemingly, in the very moment when he was
about to obtain his wishes. His oath bound him
to yield to nobody but tee Pirate crew; not even
to suffer a single one of their number, without the
concurrence of the rest, to pluck it from his
custody
.
Bonhommie
.What a terrible superstition!
Abbot
.It was, indeed. And the whole coast
of the Atlantic, from Passamaquody to Pensacola,
is full of legends derived from such superstitions,
and from the character of these deadly wretches.
Kidd, Teach, or Blackbeard, Steed Bonnet, and a
thousand others, have left their fearful memories
impressed upon these shores in every form of
crime, and every character of blood. But let us
descend one of these gorges into into the burial
place among the myrtles. I have heard of the
place, but have never beheld it. Even here, it
seems, death has found his victimshere, where
salubrity speaks in the ever murmuring breezes,
and in the incessant rolling of these surges on the
shores.
Bonhommie
.The graves are not numerous,
Father, and most of them are of very ancient date,
probably even beyond the revolution.
Abbot
.The place is very still and solemn!
How well chosen! How peaceful is the hush
which prevails above the scene! How much
does that line of hills conceal from the passing
world without. The billows break not here.
Their loudest murmurs subside here into faint, sad
harmonies that suit the quiet purposes of death.
Here are some noble oaks sheltering the repose of
unknown inmates. The names, none of them
appeal
to my memory. How lightly, in such cases,
do we pass over such memorialsas if man
recognized
no kindred, no sympathy, at least, with
any of the race, his own family or his own
associates
excepted. Yet these sleepers had friends and
kindred. They were nursed by dear affections.
They inspired hopes of the futurevague,
beautiful
,
perhaps magnificent hopesin the bosom of
fond and generous parents. What if we could
follow each of them, from the beginning to the
close of his career? It is, perhaps, a mercy that
we may not. The shroud of death is a mantle
also. We should be grateful for what it conceals,
satisfied that the judgments of Heaven, tempered
by the mercies of a common Father, can never be
more severe than those of man. Doubtless, most
of these sleepers were poor, struggling daily for
the bitter bread of labor, too frequently prosecuted
without any adequate reward. Their friends
were likely to have been of the same class. Yet,
a true affection has gleaned from its little means,
to rear the headboard of stone or wood, to the
object
of its sympathy. Here and there, an
unintelligible
initial appears. To us, its says nothing;
but there were some from whose eyes it compelled
instant overflow. Others are obliterated quite;
and here are the outlines of the grave upon the
earth, without any other memorial. No doubt,
the inmate slheps quite as soundly, as those for
whom an ostentatious memory would raise the
temple. What an absurdity, it seems, that we
should fondly desire to enjoy the memories of
those we leave behind us; since they so soon must
follow also. How much more grateful, could we
be sure of the fond sympathies of those who have
gone before; could we be sure that our faults and
offences have all been sweetly forgiven, by those
whom we are sure to meet, and who are equally
sure to know the full extent of our offences! Oh,
brother, what a living monitor is the grave! How
it speaks to pride; to vanity; to the oppressor and
his victim; with what terrible threatening to the
one; with what consoling promise to the other!
And how much more impressive seems its voice,
here, by the side of the great ocean, sounding
forever
in one's ears, as if an awful chaunt of eternity
itself. It seems ever more to cry aloudthat
dirge of winds and watersthus still shall our
voices prevail at last over all others! Brother,
those billows will continue to speak to myriads of
ages and generations, long after we, and those
whom we love, are wrapt in a silence deep as that
of these sleepers at our feet! Let us ride, my
brother.
Bonhommie
.Pursuing this grove for a while,
we shall reach the foot of another gorge, by which
to ascend the hills. Here, Father, you perceive,
we may enjoy all the seclusion of a forest, without
its interminable depths. Here is shade, quiet, and
the whispering silence of the woods. Here are
spots which the sun's rays never penetrate. Here
one may sit and meditate over favorite hopes and
studies. Here love may bring his favorite to
enjoy
the transport and security, of which Campbell
sings so sweetly in his Gertrude. And this region
is here at our feet on the one hand, while on the
other is the sandy desert and the great blue ocean
sea.
Abbot
.Some of these gorges should be
deepened
,
conducting, by an easy carriage ride, from
the sandy tract of the southern side of the Island,
to the woody ranges opposite. A brick or stone
work, with a broad solid arch passing through
these hills, would afford a picturesque and
cavernous
opening to the interior. Groves might be
trimmed up among these woods, and a grotto
might be established for supplying refreshments
and rest to the rambler.
Bonhommie
.You now catch glimpses, Father,
of the farmstead of Truesdell. From that point
he is monarch of all he surveys. There lie his
corn, potato, peas and oyster beds. A noble creek,
which, elsewhere, would be called a river, passes
before his door with a free and joyous rush. You
see his oyster flood-gates yonder, distinguished by
the brick abutments? Do you see a group of
negroes emerging from the boat, their baskets full
of fish? They never cast their nets in vain. They
have only to throw out the line, and they draw in
whiting, cavalli, yellow tail, trout, crocus, and
blackfish, in never ceasing abundance.
Abbot
.What glorious and endless sport, all
this, to our friends from the interior. Here, with
fine boats, well covered from the sun, with ample
bays, broad reserves, friths, great arms of the sea,
and beautiful creeks, winding through broad green
meadows, they might consume a summer in
delights
,
conscious never of the flight of time. How
gloriously comes up the breezes of the ocean. The
tide is now pouring in; and, almost with the same
glance, we behold the sea in all its wild and
imperious
life, in front, and the sweet repose which
pervades the sheltered tracts of meadow, and
wood, and water, in the rear.
I
Bonhommie
.Hold up, Father. We are now
at the eastern extremity of the Island. We can
go no further, except to descend upon the beach.
Abbot
.Let us stop here, to look about us!
here, amidst this little clump of myrtles. What a
wild and beautiful prospect. What a tract of
tumultuous
billows grow up before the sight! How
the breakers roll up, and roar upon the shore!
How they bound, and rush, and curl over each
others back, scattering themselves abroad in foam.
See, they come on, like a charging host, a thousand
wild steeds of the sea, champing their bits,
breaking
through all restraints, and dashing headlong
over the shoals, as if resolute to trample them
down forever. Is it an islet that rises up between
us and Long-Island? It seems so, from this point
of view.
Bonhommie
.I frankly confess, I cannot
answer
your question. It certainly has the
appearance
.
Yet I was always of the impression, that
Long-Island was the next shore to the east.
Abbot
.It should be explored. If we had a
boat now! Yet there would be no easy crossing
that breach. How the seas boil there, as if in a
whirlpool. At low water it would not be so
hazardous
,
and I should love to explore all these
placesto paddle from islet to isletto climb the
sandy heights and ascertain their hollows; and to
drowse away the hours with the sound of those
tumbling billows always in mine ears. One might
realise the charms of Robinson Crusoe, in
perfecfection
,
along these solitudes. These islands and
islets, which skirt our Southern shores, all along
the Atlantic, from North-Carolina to the Bay of
Pascagoula, are among the most curious and
lovely
features of our country. To sail among them
of a rich moonlight evening, affords you continual
prospects of fairy lands. They rise out of the
ocean like little gems; and, with a smooth sea, the
charm is rare and inexpressiblethe harmony of
relation between the object the peace and
beauty
of the scenethe billows slightly curling upon
the white sands, as if in homage, rather than
hostility
!
The inland navigation which is thus
afforded
,
is a singular advantage, particularly in seasons
of war, to the interests of commerce.
Bonhommie
.And when art and industry have
converted these grey sands into green and golden
gardens, such as Edisto Island, for example, how
much lovelier becomes the scene.
Abbot
.Our children, brother, will see a
progress
in this respect which has not blessed our
eyes. The green spots of cultivation will be made
pleasingly to alternate with these barren, but
lovely
wastes. Do you know any thing of the
occupation
and uses of Long Island?
Bonhommie
.Nothing, Father.
Abbot
.How pleasant would its exploration
be by occasional trips from Sullivan's in
midsummer
.
One might fish along the coasts, and spread
the sail for different points with each returning
day. You are aware that Clinton occupied
Long-Island
with his troops, when Sir Peter Parker
attacked the Fort with his fleet. The attack was
designed to be a combined one by land and water.
I2
That frith was to be crossed by Clinton with the
land forces; but we can see that the passage was
no easy one, particularly at a flood tide, which
was probably the period chosen for the fleet to
arrange itself before Fort Moultrie. It would
have been difficult for boats to have made their
way through that gulph of waters, and still more
difficult to have effected a landing under the fire
of the Riflemen by whom this part of the Island
was defended. Here Col. Thompson, of St.
Matthew's
,
was posted with seven hundred men. He
was provided with an eighteen-pounder and a field
piece, which probably occupied the headland upon
which we stand. His force consisted of the third
South-Carolina Regiment, all superb
sharp-shooters
.
Clinton must certainly have attempted the
passage, but the effort was not a serious one. If
it had been made his boats must have been
swamped
.
His men could not have waded it without
being swept away. We are told, they got
entangled
among the shoals. That entangleness saved
them. Had they forced their way through the
surges, under the mouths of the cannon, their
landing
must have been effected under such a terrible
fire from our people, as would have doubled to
the British the disasters of that sanguinary day.
The question is, had Thompson any battery, any
bulwarks at all, except those afforded by nature?
Another questioncan this Island be held to be
properly defended, unless there be a fortress at
this point? Steam affords facilities now for
conquest
which were then unknown. It would
require
,
no doubt, but a small fortress and a
moderate
garrison; since the wild force of the sea in
this quarter, certainly at high water, would always
contribute greatly to the strength of the place. It
is probable that the Island here was once
connected
with Long-Island. The waves have cut for
themselves an avenue. With what fury do they
plunge through the gorge. Whether Sullivan's
Island was not once connected with the main
whether the tract of creek, bayou and ledge, lying
between Haddrell's and this strip was not once
solid ground, is a question. It appears to me that
such must have been the case. May we not
suppose
that the range of heights upon which we
stand, once indicated the general elevation of the
Island, reduced by the constant assaults of the sea,
front and rear, until, as we know, the coean at
length, in some fearful tempest, the waters of the
Gulph pouring in upon us, made a clean sweep
over the whole western half of the Island. I
cannot
persuade myself that these heights are
structures
reared by the sands and soil of descending
rivers, or the heaped up tributes of the sea. And
how reasonable to suppose that the clearing the
Island partly of its timber, as Drayton tells us was
the case, has been one of the causes of its
depression
and the subsequent encroachment of the seas.
I have discovered the roots of large trees, laid
perfectly bare, and lying upon the surface, along
the outer margin of the southern beach.
Bonhommie
.The conjecture is certainly not
an unreasonable one. It should be our policy to
restore the foliage to the Island, with an equal eye
to comfort and protection.
I3
Abbot
.Trees, the seeds of which are
windsown
,
should be introduced for this purpose.
Such trees are generally of hardy and quick
growth, requiring little soil, and spreading
themselves
about with amazing fecundity. They seem
designed for these very situations. The Ailanthus
or Tree of Heaven, is one, in particular, which
might be recommended for introduction upon the
Island.
Bonhommie
.I shall introduce it myself,
Father
.
Abbot
.To the people of the interior, Sullivan's
Island ought to be a spot of qute as much
attraction
and interest, as to the people of Charleston.
Hither may they come in midsumer, and remain
till frost, in perfect security, and realizing that
luxury
that
of salting themselves, which is a regular
habit with a large portion of the Northern people.
They may come and refresh themselves upon
shrimps, fish and oysters, bathe in Neptune's own
bath, and enjoy a thousand sports at once novel
and attractive. They could visit the city daily,
and attend to business; and should the city be
unhealthy
,
could retire, in half an hour, to a scene of
equal salubrity and sweetness, nor would they be
without frequent spectacles of rare interest and
grandeur. The broad ocean spread out before
them with all his billows, ever more rolling, and
ever more pouring forth a wild chaunt, whose
harmonies appeal more deeply than to the ear of
manwhich sink deeply into the soul, and stir up
the sublimer thoughts and more spiritual fancies,
is, alone, a spectacle which forever feeds the
mind with pleasure. Here may the idler behold
the porpoise, in vast schools, rolling and plunging
with an obvious joy and luxury; and sometimes
he may chance to see the mighty liviathan of our
seas, the Devil Fish, famous in Beaufort annals,
flinging out his gigantic but slender flippers, above
the billows, as if he would embrace the passing
ships. At our feet lies a proof of powers in the
great ocean, the display of which, to the man
accustomed
only to the forest and the mountain,
would be such a spectacle as his thought would
brood upon for long seasons after. Here, safe,
himself, might he behold the storm-spirit rioting in
his native element, and the great ship, cowering
and stifled in his wild embrace, lifted up, as an
infant
in the grasp of a giant, and flung scornfully
upon the shores, as if to mock the builder and the
owner, with the folly and the feebleness of his
creation
.
It is a sloop which lies below us, half buried
in the sand?
Bonhommie
.A sloop, I reckon.
Abbot
.Mast and spar were torn out of her in
the fearful struggle, when she rushed headlong on
the shores! What did mast, and spar, and bolt,
and cable, avail against such an enemy? She had
some fair feminine name, perhapsa tribute of
admiration to birth or beauty. She was called the
Polly Whitesides, perhapsthe Fanny
Folsom
,
or Lucy Laidler. But no invocation to
the fair spirit, who presided at her christening
could relieve her then. The skipper Hopkins
Bonhomme
.I think, Father, it was not
Hopkins
.
I4
Abbot
.Jenkins, then, or Thompson, it matters
not. He felt the gale coming on, and he knew the
qualities of his clinker built clipper. He had his
little son with him, Tom, I think, but we may call
him Dick, or Peter, and the tender years of the boy
made him thoughtful of the mother. She scarcely
knew the child was out. The skipper knew she
looked for them at home that night to supper, and
that she felt anxious enough at the approach of
the gale. Thompson had no reason to doubt the
anxieties of his wife. and he was man enough to
respect them. Tom, says he, there's old
Harry getting up, there in the southeast. Up
hellum, my lad, and push for home. Tom
looked
out, having never seen old Harry before. But
the power of which they spoke in phrase so
familiar
,
seemed not disposed to give them any chance;
and the doubt arose, which to peril, old Thompson
and his son Tom, or the fair beauties of the Polly
Whitesides. It was a long struggle. But
necessity
and the storm prevailed. It was God's
blessing
,
Thompson's working, and perhaps Tom's
peculiar
destiny, that enabled the father and son, to
beach her here, and make their escape to the
myrtles
.
They laid the aching ribs of Polly
Whitesides
,
high and dry, upon the beach, and here she
lies. But how little like the beautiful thing she
was. She reminds us, Brother Bonhomme, of the
cruel wreck of other beauties. But you weep.
The remembrance is a painful one, I see. Let us
depart.
XII.
Bonhommie
.We are safe at home, again,
Father
;
and see, the Brotherhood are descending
from the piazza, to give us welcome.
Abbot
.Something has happened. They wear
faces of unwonted pleasure. They have been
made happy by some peculiar event. Let us see;
we have been long enough absent for a variety of
events. I can conjecture the occasion. Well!
my children, you seem in great spirits?
Editor
.We have been honored, Father, in
your absence, and chiefly on your account. The
honorable Council of the Island, have been to wait
upon you and us. They came in state, as is their
custom, when waiting upon distinguished
strangers
;
in a splendid barge. They have bestowed
upon us the freedom of the island, and compelled
us to accompany them on a fishing expedition, in
which we have had a great time and caught
multitudes
of fish; more than seven hundred among
the party, trout and whiting, sheephead and cavalli,
in the space of three hours. We have enjoyed a
glorious swim in the public Gondola, a glorious
repast among the Island Fathers, and as much
wit and humor as might suffice an ordinary brain
during the summer solstice.
Abbot
.My children you have been blessed
and honored. I do not regret that I was not with
you, for I have been sufficiently refreshed and
gratified in my canter through the myrtles. But
I can fancy your satisfaction; such distinctions do
not wait upon ordinary men. I have heard of the
wit and humor of the Council. I am told that
these, along with wisdom, are among the requisites
of office on the Island.
Beauclerk
.Beauty also, Father. It is
understood
that no man becomes a candidate whose
pretensions to personal beauty are not
considerable
.
The ladies vote here, and they insist upon
this quality. They assume that gentlemen of
great personal attractions, are never willing to
hide their light under the bushel; and take for
granted that an administration of handsome men,
will give them numerous balls throughout the
season. They are seldom disappointed.
Abbot
.Pshaw! Get thee behind me,
Sathanas
!
Am I fit subject for thy quizzing, and at this
time of day?
Beauclerk
.Nay, Father, believe as much of
it as you please. It might as well be true as not.
It is certain that the Council of the Island has
always been remarkable for the beauty of face
and person among them; for their wit and
wisdom
;
and for the number of balls which they
give during the season. They reason justly, after
the manner of the Government of France, and
take public amusements under the patronage of
Government.
Editor
.We have certainly had a most
delightful
time of it. As a stranger, Father, you
would have found yourself in the full enjoyment
of the degree of love and attention which you
deserve.
Abbot
.As a stranger, perhaps. But say no
more of it, my son. Of course, the funds of the
Island justify these liberal expenditures.
Beauclerk
.The receipts are not more than
half a million, chiefly derived from imposts on the
oyster and shrimp business. The licenses to fish
in these waters are in great demand; and since the
Yankees have taken to manufacture sardines out
of silver fish, a new and prolific source of income
has arisen from this commodity. Shrimps, too,
are now put up for export to California and
Patagonia
,
in oil, after the manner of the sardines;
and there is a trembling anxiety to increase the
revenue, from the anticipated uses, in the same
way, of the forests of young crabs and fiddlers,
which literally swarm in these diggins. It is
calculated
,
that, from fiddlers alone, should they
be found to answer expectation, the revenues will
be increased to a million. The Council have it
in contemplation to memorialise Congress in
behalf
the utter abolition of the duty on foreign oils,
and, failing in this, to offer bounties to those who
shall first make a profitable business of
expressing
the oil from the
bene
plant, the sunflower, and
the cotton seed. The intelligence, the vigor, the
liberality, with which the Government of the
Island pursues its course of public policy, shows
that wisdom is very far from being inconsistent
with personal beauty, and the freest exercise of
wit; as some grey beards were pleased, in
former
times, to imagine.
Abbot
.Beware, son, lest thine own humors
do not find thee a place in the new Calaboose,
(which is to be a Penitentiary also,) which, it is
said, is to be established on the Island. Here,
perchance, you may find employment in preparing
sardines, shrimps, and fidlers for the markets of
California.
Editor
.The Council did us the honor, Father,
to invite us to a public dinner, which they propose
to give in compliment to us to-morrow. Here is
a written invitation, under the broad seal of the
Island, to yourself. We excused ourselves from
any immediate answer, inasmuch as we knew not
what might be your purpose in respect to the
future
proceedings of the fraternity.
Abbot
.Your caution was a proper one, my
son. It will not be in our power to accept. We
must decline, though we shall do so with proper
respect and regret. Our time expires to-morrow.
We must return to the city in the first morning
boat.
Bonhommie
.Alas! Father, how shall I survive
your departure?
Abbot
.By the consoling hope that you will
live till our return, my sonthat you will then be
properly prepared to welcome us, by reason of
the wonderful improvements which you shall have
made upon your farmin the introduction of new
vegetables and fruits, and in your improvements
upon the old. Your oyster reserves will then be
crowded with sleek citizens, eager to open their
bosoms to your friends; and your juvenile poultry
will then have assumed that degree of maturity
which will enable them to assist in entertaining
us. We shall have more satisfaction, Brother
Bonhommie, when partaking of the luxuries and
comforts of your household, in knowing that they
are all the products of your own ground and
genius.
Bonhomme
.You overwhelm me, Father.
You are too good. I have a motive to live for, if
it be only to deserve your praises. Shall we sit
in the piazza, Father?
Abbot
.It is a sweet air, and the prospect of
the sea never stales upon my sight. It is a moral
prospect. It appeals to all a man's energies. It
is a spectacle to stimulate courage, enterprize,
progress; to brace the thought, as well as the
bosom
;
to chasten and purify, as well as freshen
and excite. There is an analogy of a very striking
sort, between mountain life, and life beside the sea.
In both cases, the objects of contemplation lead to
elevation of thought and purpose. The natural
aspects presented to the eye, are those which at
once lift and depress the soul. We are raised in
the contemplation of vastness; a world of distance;
sublime and towering forms; vast heights that
seem to stretch away to the cloud and sun; vast
tracts which seem to bury cloud and sun within
their bosom! The same prospects depress and
humble, because they awe. They tell us at every
breath, of our inferiority and insignificance. They
rebuke the pertness of self-conceit, and compel the
respect of vanity. And these lessons lead to
reverence
;
to acknowledgments, which, as they teach
us of a Superior, moderate our own assumptions,
and force us to a recognition of the Divine Master
of worlds, suns and systems. The social
advantages
of veneration are also incomputable.
Perhaps
it may be safely asserted that no man,
without
this quality, can ever have a proper respect
for genius, art, virtue, or any great human
endowment
;
any, and can never have any just respect
for humanity itself!
Editor
.You were remarking, some nights
ago, Father, upon the growing deficiency of this
virtue among us, when you were interrupted by
that grinning and chattering mime, Chiffinch.
Abbot
.The beast! I think if I were a
potentate
,
I should make an express edict against your
professional jokerspoor inflated devils, who
fancy
that it is a sort of duty with them to be funny.
Now, nobody likes a good jest better than myself;
but the first requisite of a good jest is, that it
should be in season. It should be accommodated
to the moods of the hearer, and not conflict with
the necessities of the occasion. The jest, no less
than the sermon, requires propriety for its
accoucheur
.
Now, this is what that foolish fellow,
Chiffinch
,
cannot understand. He thrust himself in
among a knot of us the other day, when the
occasion
was one of deep gravity to all, and of great
sorrow to one of the company;a serious and
ruinous involvement of his affairs, which might
beggar a large and lovely family. We were
discussing
this necessity, when Chiffinch approached.
Had he possessed the slightest capacity
to look out
from himself
, he would have seen, from our faces,
that we had a cause of anxiety among us which
left us incapable of fun. But, espying us at a
distance
,
he began instantly to prepare his joke,
such as it was;and with him to conceive, implies
as, a matter of course, the necessity for being
delivered
.
He was inflated with a straw, and would
have burst with it, could he have found no
hearers
.
So he kept us for half an hour, while he
drew out his slender circumstances of humour.
On another occasion, he stopped a gentleman,
who had just buried an only daughter, with a
story of a goat and a pumpkin, and I have heard
that a sack of sour meal, kept his wit sweet
through the dog-days. He is a man to die of
croup, in a state of second infancy.
Editor
.And yet, Father, Chiffinch is, at times,
exceedingly funny.
Abbot
.So is Mumbo Jumbo, the African
monkey, when he has his red breeches on, a
feather
in his hat, and has not yet danced that day.
But Mumbo Jumbo,
always
, is a poor devil.
Chiffinch needs only to know his time to be a very
clever companion. If he would believe more
in Solomon, and less in himself, we might almost
fancy him a Solomon. Certainly, Shakspeare's
counsel, properly valued, might enable wit
frequently
to pass for wisdom.
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it; never in the tongue
Of him that makes it.
But this brings us back to the subject of
veneration
.
Veneration is necessary to wit, if the
claims of the latter are to be respected. Wit, in
proper hands, is the sharp and always polished
rapier of wisdom. Its purpose is never
wantonness
.
It is never drawn unadvisedly, and never
works injustice. It does no wrong to a gentle
and innocent nature. It assails no becoming
sentiment
or affection. It is legitimate only in such
hands as need every sort of instrument to punish
brutality, presumption and offence. In other
hands, it is the sharp razor which the monkey
shaves with; a weapon that most commonly cuts
the shaver's throat. Veneration and wit should
always harmonize; and must, for their mutual
safety. The legitimacy of wit depends upon its
willingness to be the subordinate. Some things
are every where sacred. An earnest purpose, an
honest though erring faith, and above all a manly
enthusiasm! Enthusiasm, perhaps, is one of the
most sovereign of the virtues. It is essential to
the perfection of all the rest. It stimulates the
others to performance; it sustains them during
the trial and the struggle; and it soothes and
cheers them in defeat. Without this virtue,
socity
languishes everywhere; the energies lie
prostrate
;
the more generous tendencies of the race
suffer neglect and scorn; the community lacks
courage; trade and commerce wither; industry
is at an end; the arts abandon the soil in
loathing
,
or bury themselves from sight in dread and
silence; while cold-blooded and soulless
self-conceit
sniggers and sneers at every appeal to
patriotism
,
and every sentiment which seeks to
encourage
the resurrection of the nobler virtues. We
have been laboring under this very curse in
Charleston
for twenty years. Enthusiasm has been
crushed out of us by frivolity. Life was a mere
drowse in the lap of vanity. Men had no high
purposes, or they were frowned upon; society
degenerated into a miserable pageant, in which
the only struggle was, which could show himself
most conspicuously in the front ranks, and with
the greatest amount of tinsel. If a man rose up
and spoke of a new hope, with zeal and
earnestness
,
he was set upon as a common enemy, whose
very nature was at hostility with that stagnation
of social energy, which was foolishly mistaken for
calm and peace. They made a solitude and
called it peace! They had no faith in any
enterprise
which rebuked their incapacity; which
seemed to insinuate a doubt that all was not
perfect
in their condition. And this condition, how
joyless, how soulless, how unperforming! Society
was not without its refinements, but these were
of a sort that rendered it feeble and effeminate.
Our polish was gained at the expense of our
energies
and there was no heart in it. When I was a boy, the custom was, with the close of the day's
employment, to seek some friendly fireside. Here,
the young of both sexes met each other. The
sweetness and grace of the damsel, subdued and
refined the rough vigor of the youth; the manly
energy and performing thought of the youth,
stimulated
the mental activity, and compelled the
studies of the damsel. They acted upon each
other, and the result of this attrition was a calm,
strong, dignified intellect on the part of both;
accommodated, in each, to the proper
characteristics
of the sex. It is all altered now. We
have become fashionable and foolish. We have
the smoking and the swearing boy, the flashy and
K
the giggling girl. You no longer drop in, at
evening, at the friendly fireside. You call in the
afternoon, when you know that all are out, and
leave your card; and, during the season, the
cards thus left, bring you an invitation to a
grand ball, and you dance and sup, and there an
end. And this is society! We have exchanged
a thing of simplicity and heart, for a thing of
affectation, which is utterly without feeling. In
the language of Wordsworth
Altar, sword and pen,
Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,
Have forfeited their ancient English dower,
Of inward happiness. We are selfish men.
And again:
I am opprest,
To think that now our life is only drest
For show: mean handiwork of craftsman, cook,
Or groom! We must run glittering, like a brook
In the open sunshine, or we are unblest;
The wealthiest man among us is the best:
No grandeur now, in nature, or in book,
Delights us. Rapine, avarice, expense
This is idolatryand these we adore.
Plain living and high thinking are no more;
The homely beauty of the good old cause,
Is gone: our peace our fearful innocence,
And pure religion, breathing household laws.
These are the evils that have got too much sway
among us, and we must amend them.
Editor
.We are beginning to amend them,
Father.
Abbot
.Not too soon, or too actively. We
are doing something, I believe. But much is yet
to be done. We must bring back to society its
very noblest elementthe one which perfects all
the restwithout which all the rest is insecure
I mean veneration. There were, perhaps, but
three States of the old thirteenand these have
been the chief maternal States of the Union, that
ever impressed their characteristics deeply upon
the character of the nation. These were
Virginia
,
Massachusetts and Carolina. Their power
lay in one great virtue, veneration. They had
each of them a living and a working faith. They
were earnest in their purposes. They were not
to be deluded by vanities. They had pride, such
as the Englishman possessesand this led them
to achievement. Their pride and faith, joined
with earnestness and enthusiasm, made that great
virtue which constitutes the social religion. Home
was in their faith, and this conviction led them to
do justice to all the constituents of the sectional
character. They might be emulous of one
another
,
but they always
believed
in one another.
Envy did not blind them to the merits of a
brother
;
nor vanity delude them in respect to their
own. And thus they wrought honestly, to a
common
end, and made their country famous. Who
among us is likely now to make our country
famous
?
Honest zeal is rebuked by a sneer the
moment it rises. Generous enthusiasm feels ever
the curb of sceptical and denying society. Your
wits, who claim to be your wise men also, are
those who put their fingers to their noses, and cry
ha! ha! whenever they behold an unselfish
virtue that says: Brethren, let us work, together
for the common cause. They say to themselves,
K2
first: What office are we to have? Would
you speak of serious topics, such as belong to the
common necessity, lo you;Senator Smirk
appears
,
or Counsellor Quiz. They have been
laboring
all the morning at a joke; they have toiled
all day and manufactured a pun, and they thrust
themselves upon you with all your enthusiasm
working in your souldeep in your project for
a common good, or to meet a threatening
emergency
;
and, with a sniggerfor a drowsy
self-esteem
seldom laughs quite outthey lay the
little
,
wriggling, wormy thing before you, in the
hope to make you snigger also. And this when
your City is struggling to sustain position; when
your great men are perishing from among you,
when open and secret enemies are busy to
destroy
your liberties and securities! Verily, are
not these, on a small scale, the Neroes that fiddled
when Rome was burning?
Editor
.Father, this is very terrible!
Abbot
.Son, is it not very true! If it be a
truth, however terrible, it is the only hope for us
that there be some who will speak, and others
who will see the truth. Were the disease
incurable
,
incurable, my son, it would be only folly
so to speak, or so to see. But, thank God, I see
in my eye daily, troops of goodly and generous
youth rising into the ranks of performance; full
of soul and energy; loving their country, and
anxious to achieve something in its behalf. We
shall soon need all their strengh and enthusiasm;
and now is the time, if ever, to cast down the
false idols of society, and to show the true Gods.
Now is the time to set up in high places, as
models
,
Labor
and
Thought
, as the only true
sources
of manhood and character; to teach simplicity
of manners, earnestness of purpose, and that
hearty courage which grapples with difficulty as
with a mistress; with a love for the wrestle, and
proportioned to the vigor of each youthful
Sampson
.
My Sons, my appeal is to Young Carolina!
To the veneration and the will, linked with
enthusiasm
,
which made old Carolina famous!
Omnes
.They will answer to the call. Three
cheers for young Carolina!
Abbot
.What a grateful augury, my children!
Behold, even as you shout, that noble ship
heaving
in sight, and, with every sail set, pressing
forward
to her port. Let her be your emblem. See
how she flings and scatters from her bows, the
assailing billows. She how she cuts her way
through the yawning deep. She compels the
service of the winds. She loses no time in her
progress. She puts on all her energies, and is
winged for the attainment of her goal. Only fancy
some of our mountain friends, here, at this
moment
;men
who have never beheld the ocean,
nor seen those great swans of commerce,
speeding
over the waves with the grace and dignity
of Queens. They would feel, as should we,
beholding
a mountain for the first time, and upon it
the great world-Behemoth, about to realize the
Indian tradition, and leap from pinnacle to
pinnacle
,
onward and downward, until, at last, he
buries his mighty and smoking flanks in the
waters
of the sea.But where is our Poet?
K3
Poet
.Here, Father.
Abbot
.You improvised the other day, my
son, on seeing just such a goodly vessel. I am
not sure that the moral of your verse was not
somewhat tinged with an unwise cynicism. I did
not feel the justice of your sarcasms on Love and
Friendship, for I believe in both. It is a faith
that wrong and folly shall never beat out of me.
Man is a better animal than we think him, and
few are utterly without some redeeming virtues.
You Poets are apt to mistake weaknesses for
vices, and to be terrible when you should be
tolerant
.
Nevertheless, let us have your verses. Let
our brothers hear them. The picture of the ship,
if I recollect rightly, exactly suits that which
stretches away before our eyes.
Poet
.
(Recites.)
How proudly o'er these swelling seas,
Yon gallant vessel holds her way,
Borne on the bosom of the breeze,
With maiden-grace and Queenly sway;
The sunlight basks upon her sails,
The billows bear her gladly on,
And meekly fond, the obedient gales,
Attend her till her port is won.
Thus, in the hour of man's success,
The cringing slave becomes the tool,
And Pride will stoop, though not to bless,
And cringes where he still would rule;
Yet let the sun but cease to glow,
And falser still than wind or wave,
The servile friend becomes the foe,
And Pride the tyrant, late the slave!
The sycophant who bow'd of yore,
And lick'd the foot, nor felt the shame,
Polutes the shrine he sought before,
And speaks, instead of praise, in blame.
Nor is it Friendship that, alone.
Thus false to every faith can prove;
The guilt assails a nobler one,
And men have said the same of Love!
Abbot
.Some truth, no doubt; but the
conclusions
are false, if they go to justify our want
of confidence in the race; of worldly goods we
may save something by our scepticism; but not
to confide is to lose ourselves. Faith is the great
secret for society. Believe in the family if you
would prosper. You may be defrauded
freqently
;
but it is a greater misfortune, by your
own doubts, to defraud yourself of human
sympathy
.
Bonhommie
.Pardon me, Father, but roast
beef waits for no man.
Abbot
.It seldom has need, my Son. Let us
begin with Truesdell's oysters by way of
appetizer
.
XIII.
Abbot
.Brother Bonhommie, the lofty but,
deserted dwelling house in front, reminds me of a
duty. Fill your glasses, my children:We will
drinkthe Pinckney'sthe noble and courteous
gentlemen,the fearless and honored statesmen,
the pure, polished and incorruptible citizens.
K4
Omnes
.Standing!
Bonhommie
.There is another dwelling in
sight, Holy Father, which counsels me to a similar
duty:that of Bond I'on. Father, with your
permission, we will drink,the fine old
gentleman
of a better day and school: the good and
benevolent
man; one who has served his country
faithfully, and who still serves society gratefully.
Abbot
.We drink with pleasure, my children
pleased to perceive that we still possess the power
of discriminating and appreciating those virtues
which are not sufficiently esteemed as models.
And now, my son, let us rise. That is the true
temperance which knows how to employ God's
blessings without profligacy or wantonness. Let
us adjourn to the piazza. It is the Wilmington
steamer that goes out, I think, and there is another
that comes insee, our ship has nearly reached
the city; a brig and a schooner are also in motion,
and so are our Island steamers. These are the
human adjuncts and agents, that animate the scene.
What a picture of life is in that sea, that sunshine,
those sweeping swanlike creatures, the gay and
glittering hamlet of the Island, and the illuminated
spires of the distant city. But the sea itself
suffices
me.
Editor
.It would be a noble study to most
persons but for its annoyances.
Abbot
.These are greatly exaggerated; and
are felt chiefly during the first three days of a
voyage. Our coasting navigation, which seldom
now keeps you out three days, does not suffice for
experiment. In that period you can have only the
desagremens
of the sea, without its excitements.
It requires a longer time to recover the tone
equally
of the body and the mind, and to acquire that
sort of sea change, of which we are told in the
Tempest, which alone can possibly make you
at home as a voyager. Then your thoughts and
stomach come back to you together. Then you
see the wonders of the great deep and rejoice with
the rejoicing elements.
Editor
.I am afraid, Father, that the sea soon
loses its freshness to all but the poetical
temperament
.
I have frequently remarked, with surprise,
how little there is visible, in the progress over the
great deep, to those who go down frequently in
the ships upon the waters.
Abbot
.It was ever thus, my son, with this
class of people, even when they made their very
first voyage. They never did conceive the
wonders
and beauties of the sea. It requires the
creative
and endowing facultythe imagination for
this. But the ordinary traveller does not possess
much of this faculty. He fancies neither marvels
nor mysteries, and solves none, unless they be
those of trade. His philosophies seldom go
deeper
than his appetite, and if he loves the sea at all,
it is because of the potent influence which it
possesses
in sharpening the desires of the abdomen.
It is quite a study to watch this class of persons
on board ship. You will find them always, either
peering into the larder, or dreaming about it. The
Steward, (whom they always call
stewart
the
vulgarians!) and cook, aboard-ship, are the
persons
whose acquaintance they are first to make.
These they contrive to bribe with shillings and
civilities
.
You will scarcely open your eyes, in the
morning, ere you will see these hail fellows,
with toast and tankard in their clutches. A bowl
of coffee and a cracker is the initial appetizer, with
probably a toss of brandy in the puple beverage,
as a lacer. Then you see them hanging about the
breakfast table, where they take care to plant
themselves in the near neighborhood of certain of
the choicest dishes. All their little arrangements
are made before you can get to the table, and
there will be a clever accumulation of good things
about their plates, in the shape of roll and egg,
etc., which would seem destined to remind the
proprietor, in the language of warning, which was
spoken daily (though with a far different object)
to the monarch of the Medes and Persians
Remember
,
thou art mortal. This is a fact which
our veterans of the high seas never forget. They
carry within them a sufficient monitor which ever
cries in their ears, like the daughter of the
horseleech
,
Give, Give! They have no qualms of
conscience or of bowels; and it seems to do them
rare good to behold the qualms of others. It
would appear that they rejoiced in these
exhibitions
,
simply as embodying the assurance that the
larder was destined to no premature invasion, on
the part of the sufferers. I have often looked upon
this class of travellersnot with envyHeaven
forefend!though it would have rejoiced me
frequently
,
at sea, to have possessed some of their
immunitiesthat rare insensibility, for example,
in the regions of diaphragm and abdomen, which,
if unexercised for appetite, might at least suffer
other sensibilities to be free for exercise. But it
has provoked my wonder, if not my admiration, at
that inflexible stolidity of nature, which enabled
the mere mortal so entirely to obtain the
ascendancy
over the spiritual man. He sees no ocean
waste around himfollows no tumbling billows
with his eyewatches not with straining
eagerness
,
where the clouds and the waters, descend
and rise, as it were in an embrace of passion.
Sunrise only tells him of his coffee and cracker
noon of lunch,sunset of his tea,and the rarely
sublimed fires of the moonlight, gleaming from a
thousand waves, suggest only a period of repose,
in which digestion goes on without any
consciousness
of that great engine which he has all day been
packing with fuel. Tell him of porpoise and shark,
and his prayer is that they may be taken. He has
no scruples to try a steak from the ribs of the
shark, though it may have swallowed his own
grandmother. Of the porpoise he has heard, as
the sea-hog, and the idea of a roast of it, is quite
sufficient to justify the pains-taking with which he
urges upon the foremast man to take his place at
the prow, in waiting, with his harpoon. Nay, let
a school of dolphins be seen beneath the bows,
darting along with graceful and playful sweep, in
gold and purple,glancing through the billows,
like so many rainbows of the deep,he thinks of
them only as a
fry
an apology for whiting and
cavalli, for which he sighs with the tenderest
recollections
.
Such is very apt to be the character
of your veteran voyager; and, with him, let me
assure you, the novelties of the sea never had a
charm. In losing its sense of freshness, he never
lost a single fancy.
Editor
.Steam has robbed the sea pretty
equally
of its terrors and its charmsI mean to the great
mass of persons, Father. To a certain class of
personsa thing of beauty is a joy forever.
You now scarcely make the acquaintance of the
deep before you leave it; you are not sufficiently
long upon the waves to feel the caprices of the
winds; you are hardly ever out of sight of land.
Even when crossing the great pond, you travel
in such mighty vessels, and carry with you such a
various community, that you scarcely feel
conscious
of any change, restraint, or inconvenience.
You have society in abundance, books, sports,
balls, and dinner parties, to say nothing of
tableaux
vivants
, and ocean theatricals. In our short
voyages
along the coast, from town to town, upon the
seaas in the route from Charleston to
Wilmington
you
are out but a single night, and have seen
nothing. You fling yourself into your birth in the
one city, to awaken in the other. Few persons
care to look abroad in this interval. Few care to
traverse the ship's deck in the face of smoke and
steam, to catch glimpses of mysterious forms,
wrapped up, but not concealed, in the billows
rolling
bythat recall to you as they pass, strange
but sweet reminiscences of friends left, or friends
lost; friends whom you are about to visit, and
friends whom you are never more to see. You
see now-a-days nothing of the wonders of the deep.
You hearken to none of its voices. The spell has
been taken from its fountainsthe trident is
broken
in the grasp of its Triton. The old fables
have been driven away by that inveterate smoker
which the world has agreed to call by the name of
Steam! Mighty world, before which
The sea
Its deep green mansions, and it sparry caves,
Its shells, its naiads, and its warring waves;
Its stirring dangers, its great terrible things,
Monstrous and savage, that, from secret springs
Course in pursuit of prey
are puffed away, as by a breathdisarmed of all
but its tributary and subservient attributes, and
rendered as patient as the wild horse under the
lassosubdued, from a condition more wild than
his, to the will and domination of man.
Beauclerk
.How happy was that prediction
of Darwin with regard to the future uses of steam.
Abbot
.Repeat, my son. The poets are the
only prophets.
Beauclerk
.
Soon shall thy arm, unconquered steam, afar
Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car;
Or on wide waving wings expanded bear
The flying chariot through the fields of air.
Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above,
Shall wave their fluttering 'kerchiefs as they move;
Or warrior bands alarm the gaping crowd,
And armies shrink beneath the shadow cloud.
Abbot
.Darwin wroteI speak from memory
about 1790. The railroad and steamboat have
realised his predictions in regard to them. It
remains
that the balloon shall come into general use
for the purposes of war and travel. I see,
recently
,
that it was gravely proposed to employ
balloons
in the bombardment of Venice. Certainly,
the idea must be a terrible one to a city: that of
having paixhan shot tumbled in upon them from
the clouds! By the way, are you aware, my
children, that the Spaniards have put in a claim,
on behalf of one of their mariners, as the first
inventor
of steamboats? It precedes all others
Fitch, FultonScotchman, Englishman,
American
.
It depends upon the authenticity of the
documents which have been brought to establish
the claim. The allegations and dates would seem
to be conclusive.
Editor
.You have been a great reader, Father.
Abbot
.And not always a profitable one. My
memory begins to fail me, from the simple fact
that it never received good training. I was
desultory
as a reader. But that was not an error or
a misfortune. It is a vulgar mistake to object to
desultory reading. The more desultory the
better
.
This has been the sort of reading which has
distinguished most great men. It is, perhaps, the
very reading to bring the individual judgment into
full play. Read but one order of writings, and
you are very apt to imbibe your opinions tacitly
to accept themand without investigation. But
reading variously, by compelling you to decide
between adverse authorities, brings your own
thoughts into exercise. You are required then to
think as you read, not gulph and swallow merely.
Read everything, my children. But, mark you, I
do not counsel desultory
studiesstudy
the one
thing, which is your peculiar vocation, and you
may read every thing besides. It is my
misfortune
that my youthful habits were not studious.
I confess my boyhood to have been a truant one.
Grammar was my abomination, and I know
nothing
about it now; Arithmetic, a terrible torture
that kept me sleepless, unless I skulked it, which
I was very apt to do. Certainly, I thought that
no Christian soul could reproach me for
endeavoring
to escape such cruel persecutions. What I
might have been, or become, with proper training,
is scarcely proper for discussion. It suffices that,
though I do a great deal of what the world calls
work, I regard myself as really but an idler.
The habits of my boyhood were the fruits of a
neglect
which, considering the present happy
indolence
of my life, it would not become me to
deplore
.
My irregularities in youth brought me no
punishment. I had no parents to be troubled at
my absence, or to chide and chasten me at my
return
.
My guardian was very much a person after
my own heart. He partook largely of my nature,
and craved nothing more earnestly than repose.
So that I trespassed not upon his leisure, I might
do as I pleased with my own. My school-master
was one of those trading professors who come from
abroad, for no better purpose than money-making.
He was not only dishonest, but incompetent; and
I now look back with absolute surprise to the fact,
that, with so slender a capital of sense and
acquirement
,
he should have been suffered so long to
defraud
the community, and defeat the purposes of
nature in the sixty children committed to his care.
He knew nothing of the minds or of the
temperaments
of his pupils. He taught us very much as
a drill sergeant would have done, but without his
rigor. The boys were ranged in classes according
to their sizes. The tallest formed his upper, the
smallest, his lower classes. Certain tasks in
memory
were set them, which they acquired or not,
at pleasure. He did not punish, for that would
have irritated all partiesthe children, the parents
and himself. The former were pleased with him,
as they were neither tasked nor punished; the
parents
were content, since their sons were so, and
since they always received an admirable account of
their progress from the master; and he was
satisfied
,
as he grew wealthy upon a rare repose.
Editor
.Here were the seeds then planted of
all your Epicureanism, Father. I do not use the
word, of course, in its vulgar sense.
Abbot
.Truly; I understand you. My
philosophy
,
which has commended me to my present
dignities, was a simple one. It had its seeds
sown, as you say, under that scoundrelly
school-master
.
To economize and cherish the pleasant
associations of life, and fly from those which are
humiliating and painful, was my school boy
instinct
,
long before my reason taught me to adopt
it as a philosphy. It was the instinct, probably
that made the philosophy reasonable. It came
in admirable conflict with the duties of the school
boy. Accordingly, the sixth day in the week did
not prove sufficient for my necessities. I made a
holiday of sundry more. Monday frequently
found me upon the highways, and Tuesday upon
the sea-shore; Wednesday was a famous day in
our almanac of plasure, and Saint Thor, as we all
know, confers special privileges on the
succeeding
day, upon every young Goth who remembers
his Teuton original. Friday we are apt to
surrender
as an act of grace to the pedagogue and
birch. And one day in the week seemed to give
ample penance for all sins of the rest. It is
surprising
how easy it was in those days to repent.
We had no long rebukes of conscience to contend
with. A sin was forgotten in its successors,
almost
as soon as committed, and accumulated
offences
did not seem to add materially to the burdens
of conscience. Happy days of childhood, which
really know nothing of the nakedness which a
whole life after is consumed in the endeavor to
hide from other eyes.
Beauclerk
.You are not half so indulgent,
Father, to your flock, as you have been to
yourself
.
Abbot
.My son, we learn the right way,
because
we have once stumbled into the wrong
one. It were sorry wisdom, with me, having
seen the error of my own ways, to wink at yours.
I am too faithfully the father of my flock to suffer
you to run wild in your indulgencies. My policy
is to economize your passions, by their seasonable
restraint. This checks their excessive growth,
which would only be to their own cost and peril,
and your suffering. I thus keep your minds and
modes in perfect balance, and, by due restraint
of the animal tendenciesand all boyish
tendencies
are animal, when they are very decided
L
maintain the superiority of the moral and
intellectual
nature. On this subject but too little is
understood among us. Our affections, our
sympathies
and passions, receive too little training.
We address ourselves wholly to the instruction
of the head. The mind, the mind, the mind
receives all our care. We give too little to the
hearttoo little to the moods, the impulses, and
those more exquisite sensibilities with which we
are originally endowed, which are so many
antenn
of the souldelicate feelers of love, and
reverence
,
and faithwithout the due employment of
which, we neither preserve our own better
affections
,
nor give heed to those of our neighbor.
There was much more in the old conventual
custom
of penance than we are apt to acknowledge.
The mortification of the flesh is a prime requisite
for maintaining a spiritual ascendancy and control
over the more humiliating tendencies of the
animal
.
I would not recommend the rod, the
laceration
of the limbs, the cruel self-torture of cord
and steel. But simplicity of food, the total
absence
of stimulating drinks, the cold and solitary
chamber, and temporary privation of books,
music
and conversation, are admirable means for
subduing self-discord, for elevating and feeding
thought, for schooling irregular and evil impulses,
for framing the mind to devotional and better
moods. In the training of children, let no
worthy
parent apprehend, through excess of
tenderness
,
that privation will prove hurtful. It is
surprising
how litle nature craves. Satisfy the
absolute
wants of lifesee that health suffers nothing
and the food cannot well be too poor, the
clothing
too thin, the indulgencies too few, the tasks
too many. There must be a time for rest and
for sport: but work and denial are perhaps more
necessary to strength, health, happiness and
virtue
,
in the case of childhood, than all your gifts.
Wonderful, indeed, to see how a proper degree
of privation and toil expands the frame, enlarges
the limbs, elevates the soul, informs the mind.
Our error is, that nothing of this kind is now
permitted
.
Our sons have no training. They are
neither worked nor whipped, and without the
burdens of the one, and the chastenings of the
other, they are not likely to arrive at perfect
manhood
.
Editor
.You do not seem, Father to confide
much to moral suasion
Abbot
.Moral fiddlestick! If you could
confine
the pupil to one exclusive community, which
was not only pure in its morals, but perfect in its
wisdom,moral suasion would be a thing of
course. But do not undersand me as arguing
in behalf of harsh treatment and violence, as
absolutely
necessary in subduing a stubborn nature.
I prefer privation; the denial of those things
upon which the boy has set his heart. I insist
upon seclusion, cold food, sparingly given, cold
water,and if the urchin be very fat, a hair shirt.
But I contend that he must be made
to obey
. That
is the inevitable necessity, and if the privation,
and the starvation, and the hair shirt, will not
bring him to his senses, then clothe him with birch
as with a garment.
L2
Beauclerk
.You were certainly born for your
office, Father. You were born to be a
disciplinarian
a
monk of the Ascetic Schoola
Abbot
.Avaunt thee, pagan! This is the
gratitude
for all my indulgence. For this have I
suffered thee to take champagne with me upon
the beach, to the great consternation of the rigidly
righteous.
Beauclerk
.But a single bottle, Father!
Abbot
.The allowance was small, I grant
ye, but in full proportion to your merits. Still,
you are half right, with all your impertinence. I
have often fancied that the mode of life pursued
by those old Monks would be the very sort of
life for me;the life of contemplation rather than
of action. I envy the luxuries of their long life
repose, in the embrace of a thought that never
lacked its ideal. I frequently catch myself
thinking
and dreaming of the pleasant in their lives
their secluded cellstheir brooding devotions
their sublime and spiritualizing fancies. I
imagine
to myself the venerable abbey on the
hillside
,
or in the hollow, or over-grown with ivy,
the drowsy porter at the gates, and the aged
sacristian among the tombs, spelling out the
inscription
,
the self-chidden man prostrate before
the altar, with muttered `
miserere
' deprecating
the wrath of Heaven by humbling himself in the
face of Earth. I seem to drink of the dim,
religious
light which streams through the groined
and painted window, like some spiritual effusion
rather than like ordinary sunlight; and
crouching
beside the gigantic column, whose capital is
lost in the various tracery of the lofty roof, I feel
myself annihilated in the immense space which
there seems pregnant with Deity. The very idea
of such security, expands the soul. The
exclusion
of daily cares, of crowding man, of ordinary
hopes and yearnings, brings us visibly and
momentarily
nigher to Heaven. In proportion as
we shut out the struggles of our fellows, and
their communion, the soul feels the necessity of
turning to some influence by which its solitude
can be peopled. And thought peoples the
solitude
always with the spiritual. To the good
man confident in virtue, the forms which gather
about the hermit, are fresh from the crystal hills
of Paradise; the murmurs which musically fill
his ears, are echoes from the thousand stringed
harp that sounds ever at the portals of Heaven;
and how subdued become his passions, and how
sweet his fancies, and how full of strength and
richness are his thoughts. If he trembles or falls
if he is hurt or apprehensiveit is because his
struggle is like that of Jacob in the valley of
Penuel
a
struggle with an angel in which he
prevails
at lastin the very failure of which he is
endowed with the strength of Princes. The great
benefit of solitude is in the self-communion which
it brings. God is always a party where man
communes with himself. Whispers salute the
mortal ear which mortal tongue offends not. High
counsels informs the spirit in its solitude. Self
studies alone unveil the strength as well as the
weaknesses of the inquirer. Man can only know
himself in this fashion, through this medium, under
L3
the sacred influences of solitude. It is the error
and the misfortune of our world and day, that we
all of us live too much abroad. We have no
homes. There are no places sacred to the thought
and self-communion. We deliver ourselves to
the multitude. We ask them to examine us. We
dwell out of doors. Our thoughts are uttered
for the press; our virtues for show. The world
is too much with us; and, in its communion, we
utterly forget our own. No man knows what an
empire he hashow well peopledhow rich in
all sort of possessionsall in his own soul. What
pregnant fancies that are never let to fly; what
abundant resources which are never put to
interest
;
what ingenuity that is never made to spin
or weave; what art that is never suffered to build
or to create. And, thus endowed, we travel to
the mart, and in the monotonous under song of our
neighbor, we grow blind and deaf to the
exquisite
musical keys which lie open and yearning for
the appointed pressure of our own fingers. We
lack courage for our own world, and rely too
much upon that over which we can seldom
acquire
any, or only a very brief control.
Editor
.And singing for one's neighbor, one
is constantly called upon to stoop, to make
concessions
which mock the truth of the soul, and all
the pride of the sensibilities.
Abbot
.As Byron said of the Laureate's song
of homagewhich dare not aught prolong,
save the Eulogy of his sovereign. The servile
desire to please simply, is as little consistent with
the vocation of the Poet, as with that of the
Prophet
or the Priest. His mission is a nobler one.
He is himself a Prophet. He is decreed to be a
leadera guidea discoverer. He does not, and
must not, confine himself to the language of the
pesent, since his special duty is the future. He
cannot hope for the love of his generation, since
he is sent only for that succeeding. The genius
that lowers his standard to the time, cannot
survive
his time, for the sufficient reason that the
time itself is not stationary. The age hurries on
with sensible rapidity. We are daily making new
blazes in new forests. The old land-marks are
abandonedswept away in the fast rushing floods
of an enlarging civilization. To plant his banner
in advance of this mighty comingto hew out
the first path-wayto say, in this route shalt
thou travel, and upon mountains and oceans yet
unseen, but which, from my eminence, are visible
to me, shalt thou fix thy future eyesthis has
always been the business of the prophetic genius
the master spirit of the time.
Editor
.Could we be persuaded of the truth
of this, Father, and enter the solitude, in search of
thought, at the frequent and needful season!
Abbot
.We are not quite ripe for it, my son.
We are in the enjoyment of the first gush, of an
unexpected power. The great mass is rushing
on, eager in acquisitions which another age will
abandon as worthless. Some master spirits may
behold this even nowmay see the coming
discoveries
may
look out upon the Canaan which
their own footsteps may never tread. In the
literature of the age, we may possibly even now,
L4
read dim prophecies of this future. No age is
left utterly unattended to by its seers. They share
the usual fate of those who tell imperfect or
unwelcome
truths. Like her Troy, blasted by
Phbus with prophetic fire, they win no faith
from those upon whom they bestow the very
secrets
of the deity. Vainly they cry from their
solitudes. The voice is lost in the storming of
the billows, that rock to and fro in the struggle
of the highway, wave succeeding wave, and crest
after crest swept forward in the continual flow
of the capricious waters. Happy he who goes
aside from this multitudewho can detach
himself
from the mass, and, in the independence of
the forest, appeal to his own individual nature
and bring the internal man out of the depths and
retreats of his own heart. Less happy, but far
happier he, than the million whom he leaves. He
will gather none of their spoils but he will grow
richer in the knowledge of his own. He will
not flourish in their eyes, but he will be conscious
of himselfwhich they are not. He will live.
Every emotion will have its proper utterance
the hope its fruition, the fancy its flowers, the
imagination
its wingthe man will know his God
feel himself made after his glorious image.
Editor
.Alas, Father! the great difficulty
seems to be in determining one's
status
. What is
our rank; what is our trust; the duty specially
confided to our hands?
Abbot
.It is the study of a life, my son; and
the end of it may leave us still in doubt whether
we have pursued the true vocation. But there
can be no doubt that the search is still decreed.
Know thyself! Ascertain thy use, and work
according
to what thou knowest, and according to
the strength that is in thy sinews. We may work
as thoroughly in repose as in action. Some men
are made for action, others take a humbler place
in the business of human performance. But they
work together, though they work apart. Here
is a new truththe world has got possession of
itno matter how. It prefers not to ask who
discovered it, least its gratitude may be taxed.
It would be easy, perhaps, to show whence, by
whose researches, and how long it lay imploring
man to behold, before he deigned to set his eyes
upon it. But, once found, and seen, the truth
is set in motion. It is to perform. It has a
working
destiny before it; for every new truth is God's
agent, for a time, or for all times, in the proper
training of the race. It is delivered to us only
when the race is prepared for its reception. For
its transmission certain fiery spirits are employed,
who carry it aloft above the crowd, but in their
sight, as one carries a torch, which, thus lifted
high, the winds cannot extinguish. These men
go by various names. In one land they are called
Moseses, in another Mahomets, in a third,
Luthers
,
and so onevery land being in some
degree
provided with its working spirit according
to its progress and its necessity. Glorious they
are and great, and needfulbut, behind these,
and quite out of sight, are the greater but more
shadowy forms, by whom the torch was first
enkindled
the
sacred fire preserved in secret
places
and
finally given into the hands of these
fiery-working spirits. These were the men who
wrought in solitudewho communed with God
in the wildernesswho went up to the struggle,
in the solitary mountains, while the million strove
together with loud cries below, and wasted life
in vain tumults, whether of danger or delight.
The world is thus made up. There are many
classes, it is true, but these need not all be
considered
.
Two of them stand apart, which are the
true mental leaders. The one finds the truth, the
other carries it forward. The one sees the present
deity, the other lifts his image before the multitude.
Contemplation is the life of the oneaction of the
other. Of these, the last is the true offspring of
the first. No child was ever born more legitimate.
But they frequently come in conflictsire and
offspring
.
The genius which conceives the truth
passes on to other discoveries. The true worker
never rests. The seeker is never satisfied with
the found,for the forms of truth are infinite, and
the tasks of search are strictly set for each
succeeding
generation. It happens that, while the
discoverer
toils in new developments, he comes in
conflict with the zealot whom he has himself
employed
to carry forward the preceding. A blind
worker is the latter, if a strong. It is perhaps well
that he should be so, else where would he procure
his couragewhere find that confidence in his
mission which makes him hurry in its prosecution,
though he sees and feels that his goal must be the
stake. It is this faith in the light that he carries
before men's eyes that makes him war against
other lights. Error, he knows, has its lights also
shining and burning lights for a season
comet-like
effulgences that show a glorious train which
satisfies myriads of gazers who ask not after the
body from which it is supposed to flow. Natural
it is that the should war with every light but his
own. Thus comes the conflict even between the
professors of truth itself. They do not see that
all human truth is partialthat it is the divine
truth alone which is perfect. They cannot be
taught that the several fragments which they bear
are capable of unionthat they are parts of each
other, and all parts of the perfect form after which
the successive races are destined to struggle. It
is only in the new revelations that they give up
their issues upon the old. It is only in the
broader
blaze of a yet more perfect light, which absorbs
all the scattered gleams which have preceded it,
that they discover how frequently, in their zeal for
the truth, they have labored in deadly hostility
against the true.
Bonhommie
.Your segar is out, Father.
Abbot
.No more. I am for a
siesta
. Pray,
brother, waken me when I have slept
seven
minutes
.
The siesta never sheuld exceed
ten
. We
take supper on Prospect Hill to-night.
XIV.
Beauclerk
.You have heard, boys. We have
but seven minutes. The old man will probably
take ten for his
siesta
. We have no time to lose.
I am for the other bottle.
Bonhommie
.The motion is a good one. Is it
the Champagne or the Perry that you prefer?
There is a bottle of each upon the table.
Beauclerk
.The Perry is good, brother, but
it has not the virtue of the Champagne. We will
keep it in reserve, until our tastes become less
nice. Allow me, and you shall see how I shall
persuade that cork out of coventry. Ha! smack!
With what a burst of delight it bounds for the
ceiling, like a noisy boy just let out from school.
Let it play. It shall never again be put in bonds
by us. A good creature is Champagne.Ha! my
Bard of the Islesyou do not drink! What's the
matter?
Poet
.I am troubled. Our venerable Father
seems sad.
Beauclerk
.Pshaw! only sleepy! He took
too many of the oysters.
Poet
.No! He was sad before dinner.
Something
touches him. His conversations, of late,
seem to me to lack their customary buoyancy.
They sound in my ears like melancholy notes of
warning.
Beauclerk
.Pooh! pooh! That's because
he preaches so much. He will neither be happy
himself, nor suffer us to be so, In the language
of Mose: He won't give the b'hoys a chance!
I confess, I'm restive under his asceticism, and I
am not the only one of the fraternity. The truth
is, the Abbot gets old apace. He is on the decline,
and the sooner we let him know that we have
found a proper successor the better.
Bonhommie
.Brother Beauclerk, how can you
dream of such a thing?
Poet
.Monstrous! Talk of decline; talk of
deposing our venerable Father; talk of his
asceticism
;
his severity; his restraints; when we all feel
them to be our best securities. We enjoy, now,
Brother Beauclerk, the right sort of freedomthat
which, while it encourages pleasantry and
happiness
,
is not inconsistent with propriety. It is the
curse of most clubs that their freedom soon
degenerates
into mere license. This is not the case
with us; yet we are permitted all social
enjoyments
.
Beauclerk
.He has forbidden brag, vingt'un,
poker, and other games, which I like.
Pictor
.Those only which derive their chief
interest from the gains which they yield. Games
of mere chance are forbidden. He encourages
whist, chess, billiards, backgammon, and many
others.
Beauclerk
.Yes, but only as moral exercises!
Poet
.You know his philosophy on that
subject
.
He approves of games, which exercise the
thoughts of the mind, or the muscles of the body;
which promote intellect and memory; agility,
strength and grace. He only discountenances
those which provoke dangerous appetites, and
exercise
selfishness and cunning. Talk of his age
and asceticism, when it was only a week ago that
he beat us all at goff.
Beauclerk
.He has a sort of good humor, but
it don't suit me exactly, and as for keeping us
leashed as it were, denied to engage in the sports
we desire, and forcing upon us those only which
he approves, I frankly tell you, I don't relish it at
all. The Abbot's a good man enough, but he's
quite too much a puritan for me; and I tell you
that's the opinion of more than half the fraternity.
Pictor
.I don't believe a word of it.
Beauclerk
.You'll see! He will have to give
place to another.
Poet
.Who! indeed! I'd like to see the
brother
of the fraternity bold enough to take the seat
which he abdicates. His own consciousness of
presumption will sink him through the chair. No!
no! brother Beauclerk, these are damnable
heresies
which you utter, for which no penance can be
too severe.
Beauclerk
.You will find that I shall be
absolved
.
He will walk, you'll see! I wouldn't
give the old man pain, and we shall vote him a
service of plate when he retires; but his day's
done: he's
passe
. Your health, Bonhommie.
Pictor
,
(aside)
'Tis the wine that speaks.
Poet
,
(aside)
Not altogether.
In vino
veritas
!
Where there's so much smoke, there's some
fire. Something's wrong. Beauclerk's got into
bad company. He has been a little surly for some
time past. But say nothing to the Abbot. Let
our brother have time to feel his follies, by
privately
meditating them.
Beauclerk
.What do you whisper? Come!
glass all round. Brethren, don't suppose me
hostile
to the holy Father Abbot. I love the old cock:
'pon my soul I do! But I would spare his age
the trouble of keeping in check such troublesome
sparks as myself.
Bonhommie
.What say you, my brothers for a
siesta
all round? I confess to a certain sort of
drowsiness.
Beauclerk
.Not a bit of itnot certainly till
we finish the bottle. I'm for a song my boys.
'Twas a monkey that danc'd on the top,
Eh! the Abbot!
Enter Father Abbot
.
Abbot
.Continue your song, my son.
Beauclerk
.Beshrew me, Father, if I can!
Your sudden appearance has exorcised the spirit
of song within me. Have you enjoyed your siesta?
Abbot
.My seven minutes are eleven.
Poet
.But you have not slept, Father?
Abbot
.Yes, slept and dreamed; and such a
dream! I dreampt my children that, all at once,
all the teeth dropt out of my head.
Beauclerk
.Hem! an omen!
Poet
.In former days superstition had declared
such a dream to be of the most fatal character;
but now
Abbot
.Dreams are simply thoughts, my son;
the exercises of an imagination without its usual
restraints. I can account for this of mine. It is
the result of a previous train of thinking, upon
which, hitherto, I have said nothing to any of you.
The loss of my teeth signifies the loss of my children.
Omnes
.How, Father?
Abbot
.It signifies that we are to separate.
That the teeth fell out all at once, shows that the
act which separates me from
one
, separates me
from
all
. This can be only in two waysby my
death or withdrawal from the fraternity. But as
the teeth fell out without let or hindrance, it is
clear that the separation is my voluntary act. Now,
as I certainly shall never commit suicide, it follows
that I must leave you. This, my children, was
the secret determination to which I had already
come.
Poet
.Impossible, Father! You surely will
not leave us. Our shepherd
Beauclerk
.You have been our Father so long.
Abbot
.Precisely! It is for this, among other
reasons, that I feel bound to abdicate. There is a
grace and propriety, my children, in not lingering
unnecessarily upon the stage. Old men should
learn to retire, and give way to their sons, before
they become
too
old. We thus save ourselves
from sneer and censure; we thus escape the
exercise
of one of the most ungracious sorts of tyranny.
It is the misfortune that old men, accustomed to
office, never know when to retire. They never
reflect
upon the hopes of youthful ambition, in whose
way they stand. They are as little considerate of
society, whose affairs they can no longer conduct
with energy and skill, and seem not aware that
they are kept in place rather by a deference which
cannot forget the past, than in consequence of their
admitted capacity to do the business of the present.
I shall endeavor not to fall into this error, my
children
,
and my determination was made only the
week before we came to the Island, to make the
conclusion of our visit here, the close of my
administration
.
My dream forced the utterance of my
secret from me. You will have to appoint my
successor in your next regular chapter. In the
interim, hearken to the disposition which will be
made of your time. From the Island, we visit
Cooper river for a day. The planters are now
harvesting their crops, and the scene will be a
grateful one. After that we proceed to a tour
among the mountains of Georgia and our own
State, the scheme of which will be submitted you
to-morrow. You have heard my children.
Beauclerk
.Eheu!
Abbot
.Be not sad, my children. You
tremble
,
my Bard! Dear young son of Apollo,
wherefore
should you tremble?
Poet
.Alas, Father!
Cosi stupisce, e cade
Pallido, e smorto in viso
Al fulmine improvviso
L'attonito pastor.
[2]
[2]
Thus stunn'd, and stupified, and deadly pale,
Falls to the earth the Shepherd, as he hears,
The sudden burst of thunder o'er his head.
But, as he finds how idle were his fears,
He rises from the earthhe breathes once more,
And seeks and numbers his fear-scattered flock.
Abbot
.Ah, my son, you have your answer in
the remaining verse of the same passage:
M
Ma quando por s'avvede
Del vano suo spavento,
Sorge, respira e riede
A numerar l'armento
Disperso dal tumor.
We always exaggerate our losses in the
moment
when they occur. With time, we feel the
idleness of our fears. The scattered flock is soon
recovered by a new Pastor. God never leaves
any community without the Shepherd who can
lead them to safe and pleasant pastures; always
assuming that the sheep are not of that perverse
breed which is properly decreed to the butcher.
You will not miss your present father, my
children
,
so much as he misses you; and, believe me,
it is high time that you should make provision for
the future. The fraternity has numerous brothers,
most of whom are quite as well fitted as myself
to serve you. They have seen my system. It is
generally approved of. They will carry out my
plans. You will enjoy society without
formalities
;
leisure and luxury even, without license;
sports and pleasure without excess; labor
without
exhaustation; and the flow of a various
conversation
,
without dispute or controversy. We
have studiously excluded from our order, all that
class of spirits who lie in wait for disputation;
who cavil at words; who are forever on the
look out for flaws in your grammer or your
argument; not so much with the view to correct
your error, as to exercise their polemics. You
will continue to exclude all such people from your
haunts: all peevish, captious spirits; all triflers
who never rise to the dignity of an earnest
intelligence
;
who never respect the moods of a
neighbor
;
and who find an excuse in the emission of a
bad pun, for interrupting a fine philosophy. You
will enjoy the creature comforts with like caution
and moderation; assured of this, that excess
always
brings its own penalties, and that the
pleasures
of life, of whatever kind, are like
sweetmeats
,
comfits, &c.very good things in their
way, and at the proper season, but the worst
things in the world upon which to make a meal;
not only hurtful to the health, but to the appetite
itself. But a truce to this, my children. These
texts have been too often preached from before,
to render necessary their repetition, even at the
moment of parting. If, hereafter, you remember
me, you will not easily forget my lessons. Let
us now to other matters. I could wish, my dear
Pictor, that you would seize upon that evening
landscape. The view from this point, in the
direction
of the City, would make a lovely one on
canvass
.
You look through a delicious avenue, the
long stretch of shore, Haddrell and Mount
Pleasant
on the right, and the western extremity of
the Island on the left, forming, as it were, a
framework
for the picture. The evening sun sheds a
glorious halo over the City that seems to loom
upwards to its embrace. Its darker features
turned towards us, with the sunlight in the back
M3
ground, affords all the effect of an exquisite and
noble
contrast; while those richly dyed and fantastic
clouds, with edges of crimson and orange,
hanging
over it as the ample curtain of some imperial
couch, render wholly unnecessary the relief which
flat scenery so commonly seems to need in the
absence of lofty wood crowned elevations. Here,
in the foreground, the village of Moultrie comes
out boldly and beautifully: a city seemingly
itself, and seeming, indeed, at its western
extremity
,
to unite with the more distant City. It is
only by the bold outline and lively clearness of
the one, and the faint, subdued and dimly shining
aspects of the other, that you are led to suspect
the interval that lies between them. The two
steamers now sweeping over the space between,
give you all that is needed for the
vitality
of the
picture; which, beheld as we behold it now, and
from this point of view, is as lovely a landscape
as ever charmed the eye. It is not, indeed, the
common painter who can do such a subject well.
Bold outlines may be hit off by a very ordinary
hand; but the delicacy, the sweetness, the soft
tenderness and grace of this picture, require the
nicest circumspection, the sweetest fancy, and the
most elaborate finish. Such a subject would
honor the pencil of Fraser.
Pictor
.I have been sketching the very scene
already, Father. I have seen it very much with
your eyes. If permitted it shall appear in the
gallery of the Abbey, at the next regular chapter.
Abbot
.Ah! my son! This is what I love!
The art which
works
, rather than
talks
which
performs rather than promises;this is what is
most needful among our social virtues. We are
beginning to bestir ourselves my children. I feel
that a new era has dawned upon our people. We
can all of us report progress. Charleston has
hitherto consisted, really of
two
communities, and
these have been in deadly conflict for twenty
years or more. The one community consisted
of a people coerced by the necessities of life,
devoted
to toil and business, and bringing to their
work the capital of fresh energies, eager hopes and
sleepless enterprise. Their deficiencies chiefly lay
in the respects of social tone. They had no
acknowledged
place in a society, which, peculiar at
first, and forming one of the oldest communities
in the country, had acquired a certain
permanence
of position;was fixed and recognised;
and had, in various ways, reached a very high
distinction. This distinction formed the capital
of the other portion of the City. Its people could
boast of
a past
. They could look back with pride
to their ancestry, many of whom occupied an
acknowledged and high place in our annals. They
had been accustomed to wealth,had all the
advantages
of social training and education, and
could assert those graces of manner which require
leisure and society as well as education and wealth.
It is difficult to realize the charm and extent of these
accomplishments, and we are thus too frequently
led to over-rate their value. Certainly, there
is nothing so grateful in society as exquisite
manners
that
nice delicacy of deportment, which
never outrages a sensibility, which tempers
earnestness
M4
with grace, and seasons an attic wit with
a politeness that takes all venom from the point.
Now, to attain these graces of society, we are
required to make
some
sacrifices; but our old
community had made too many. The danger is
always that, in the perfection of our tastes, we
lose some of our necessary energies. The secret
is to refine our manners without forfeiting our
strength. This might always be effected, if a
miserable vanity did not interpose equally to
thwart natural events, and a just philosophy. The
man of manners and refinements, is apt to make
them especial objects of pride; and in doing so,
emasculates his mental energies. He perpetually
contrasts his quiet, graceful manner, with the
rude hurry of the working man; and in
proportion
as the rough energy of the other offends his
tastes, will he turn away equally disgusted with,
or unobservant of, the vigor and power which are
coupled with the roughness which offends him.
In rejecting what is evil, or inferior, in the
manners
,
he makes the mistake of rejecting also the
virtues of that manhood which is the secret of
safety in all communities. He learns to dispise
labor and art, which are the two great
conquering
agencies of society and man; and, in the over
appreciation of his own graces, he loses utterly
the great virtues of his neighbor. The other, in
turn, too often revenges himself on the society
which rejects him, by disparaging the
accomplishments
which he had not allowed himself the
leisure to acquire. He rushes to the other
extreme
of behaviour. He adopts a rude bearing
and an abrupt manner. He studiously roughens
his tone, and strips his deportment, as far as he
may, of the exterior graces which convention has
established as the means of softening the
necessary
attritions of society and business. You will
have perceived, you who can remember, what a
contrast in the behaviour of too many of our
youth to what it was only twenty years ago. In
the school which furnished our models, at that
period, we were studiously taught to give way
to age, to infancy, to woman, whether white or
black. The concession was made to feebleness
no less than dignity and distinction. We never
hustled the crowd for place or position. If we
entered the lobby of the theatre there was no
struggle. Did we go to the post-office for letters,
we waited our turn. It was no justification for
thrusting our elbows into the ribs of our
neighbor
,
that we were in a hurry. My neighhor's
corns still demanded my respect, though I had
business
elsewhere. The truth was not then wholly
forgotten, that the world was not made simply on
our account. I see a great and melancholy change
in this respect, which change I charge, in some
degree
,
upon the recklessness of trade, and its too
little regard for the requisitions of society. This
demeanor is the more reprehensible, inasmuch as
trade should especially cultivate the graces and
needs not violate a single social propriety in order
to success. Its energies need not be impaired, in
any degree, by a careful regard to the
suavitor
in modo
. Trade, which is the tributary of
commerce, has only to take its character from its
M5
superior. Commerce is, perhaps, the greatest of
civilizers. It subdues war; it reconciles hostile
nations; it appeals to art, and nourishes it with
veneration; its representative have been the most
noble of the princes of the earth. There could be
no better teacher of what is at once manly in social
energies, and lovely in social refinement. Denied
social position, at the beginning of his career, the
working man has only to wait patiently, and
prosecute
his toils, modestly and earnestly, with his
proper lights and guides before him. Society
demands
an apprenticeship, as well as arts and
sciences
.
At all events, no man must seek to revenge
himself upon society for its seeming neglects, by
abandoning his soul to Mammon. This is to
sacrifice
the substance for the shadow; the soul for
the purse. Too many are apt to make this
mistake
,
and to set up Plutus as the only true idol in
society. The faith is a common one enough, but
a false one. That society which mere money can
command, is seldom worth having. The wise and
the good must equally despise it. Yet a bad
passion
helps this vulgar faith, too frequently, into a
strange activity. The disappointed and vain
aspirant
after position, feels that money brings him
power; that, with money he can master men; that,
in process of time, he will buy the homestead of
the haughty aristocrat, who has too much scorned
his pretensions; that he will become the master of
those fair fields that have hitherto mocked his eyes
at a distance; and that the sons, or grandsons, of
his social rival, will yet be compelled to throng
about the doors of his counting room, soliciting the
patronage, and employment of the very person
whom their sires could despise. This has been a
common history among us. What with
exclusiveness
,
and the enjoyment of the
dolce far niente
, the
honored names of a past generation are greatly
reduced in dignity and fortune. They thrive no
longer; but the good omen is to be found in the
fact that so many of their descendants are showing
themselves willing to work. I have in my eye at
this moment several noble youth, who are
grappling
with their duties with that hearty zeal and
courage, which make the only true manhoodnot
dipping a little into business as a timid boy goes
into the water, as if he dreadfully feared to wet
his feet;but plunging, head-foremost, fearless, as
the bold swimmer who is resolved on wrestling
fortune from the waves. When this shall become
general in our community;when society shall
recognize the necessity of coupling manhood
always
with its refinements; not suffering taste to
degenerate into fastidiousness, or good manners
into feeblenees;but honoring these only as they
are tributary to manly performance;and when,
on the other hand, the performing and the business
men, shall recognize the just claims of a social
organization
;shall
recognize what is due to good
taste, social refinement, delicacy and propriety of
manners; and all those arts which tutor the
sensibilities
,
and civilize the rude humanity,then shall
the two branches of our society work together as
they have not done before in my recollection.
Hitherto, there has been no communion between
them. They have not only not worked together,
but one portion has opposed to the other
vis inerti
,
denying itself almost wholly to a cause that was
common to them both,the maintenance and
progress
of the community. Now, we have a
grateful
prospect of better things. We are fast getting
rid of our absurdities. We are beginning to see
life in its just attributes. Necessity is doing its
work, and vanity and pretention no longer fold
their robes about them, looking with contempt
upon that energy which impels the engine,which
drives the barge, and harnesses the very lightning
to the cars of commerce and society. True
manhood
,
now, is everywhere regarded as to be found
only in performance;
and the youth now-a-days,
who is not willing to work cheerfully in his
vocation
,
and according to his endowments, should be
shorn of his beard, dressed up in petticoats, and
set to brood with foolscap and bells to the end of
his baby destiny.
Editor
.The exclusiveness, Father, of which
you have spoken on the part of a portion of our
community, was, perhaps, in no respect more
injurious
than in the frequent family intermarriages.
Abbot
.You are right, my son. Nothing so
much tends to destroy the moral and the physical
virtues of a race as a habit like this. The breeds
must be crossed. It is surprising that, with the
general conviction, so common among us, of this
necessity in the case of animals, we should have
disdained to acknowledge the importance of the
rule in respect to man. In this connexion men
are to be considered as animals also. No man
should marry his cousin, of any remove; and it
would be well if men always sought their wives in
other Districts, or in other States. Insular and
small communities, in particular, should always
send their young men abroad to wive. Failing in
this, their children must necessarily be of a puny
and inferior physique, will be of inferior intellectual
endowment; in repeated cases, will become idiots,
and finally will cease to breed at all. Family
intermarriages
in our country, are too frequently devised
for the maintenance of that exclusiveness which
family
pride too much regards as its only security.
It is thus that we seek to supply the guaranties of
distinctions which, in aristocratic governments, are
afforded by titles of nobility. The better
specimens
of the European nobility, are almost
invariably
the fruit of a cross; the nobleman seeking
alliance with the commoner. The
motive
with the
British nobility for such alliances, is that wealth
which the heir to a great house requires to sustain
his dignity. The
result
is the perfection of
physical
manhood. The British aristocracy are
probably
the finest looking set of men in the world;
exhibiting an organization of form and feature
which has never been surpassed. The effect upon
their
character
has been equally admirable. You
would be surprised to see the number of these
young scions of nobility who traverse the world in
all sorts of exploring enterprises. Now you find
them in the East, on the back of a dromedary,
coasting the desert, and sleeping in tents, among
the most lawless tribes of the country. You
remember
the exquisite picture painted by Lord
Byron, in his Dream;
He lay
Reposing from the noontide sultriness,
Crouch'd among fallen columns, &c.
The picture is common to the English nobleman.
Anon, you find them, ranging over the plains and
prairies of our Northwest, pursuing the buffalo
and the grisly bear. No hardships discourage, no
dangers affright them; and they combine
admirably
the virtues of a bold, impulsive manhood, with
the best breeding of a social aristocracy. We
must protect
our
family dignities by other virtues
than those of exclusiveness, my childrenby
performance
,
by achievement, by deeds, by enterprise,
energy, perseverancethe very virtues which
originally
conferred distinction upon, and planted
pride within the bosom of the founder of the family.
Many, if not most of the leading names in Carolina
were merchants, tradesmen and mechanics. There
are few, however haughty, who, travelling
backward
a few generations, would not stumble over
the family heir-loom in the shape of an axe, an
anvil
,
a jack plane, or an anchor. Let us teach the
true pride to our sons which should make them
honor forever, and prize, with a sort of reverence,
the implements by which their fathers acquired
fortunes for their children, who have not always
preserved, or prized properly, the tools by which
they did so. He who feels shame to be reminded
of the craft of his ancestor, deserves none of the
profits which followed from its exercise. What I
should like to teach in particular isthat nobility
lies wholly in noble performance; that without
performance, there is no manhood, and that, while
occupations differ in degree, quality or profit, he
is to be esteemed as a man, and he only, who,
having
ascertained what he is good for, goes to his
task; not merely beneath the goad of necessity, for
that betrays the base nature of the slave; but as
one eager for the duty which is assigned him, and
anxious to make himself distinguished in his
vocation
:
and every vocation may have its distinctions,
if those only attempt it who are equal to its tasks.
Editor
.Were these the common principles
the general sentiments, Father, what a glorious
community we should have. What a splendid
spectacle is that of a great city, all parties working
together in the common cause; all eager, hopeful,
cheerful, industriousproud only in emulation,
and thoughtful chiefly of the means of multiplying
the common resources and the common securities.
Abbot
.Do you remember Milton's picture,
my son, in the Areopagitica? Behold now
this vast city; a city of refuge, the mansion-house
of liberty, encompassed and surrounded with his
protection. The shop of war hath not there more
anvils and hammers waking, to fashion out the
plates and instruments of armed justice in defence
of beleaguered truth, than there be pens and heads
there, sitting at their studious lamps, musing,
searching, revolving new notions and ideas
where-with
to present, as with their homage and their
fealty
,
the approaching reformation. Others as fast
reading
,
trying all things, assenting to the force of
reason
and convincement. What could a man require
more from a nation so pliant and so prone to seek
after knowledge? What wants there to such a
towardly and pregnant soil, but wise and faithful
laborers, to make a knowing people a nation of
prophets, of sages, and of worthies? We reckon
more than five months yet to harvest;
there need
not be five weeks, had we but eyes to lift up. The
fields are white already
. There is another
passage
of this noble sort of eloquence near this, in
the same treatise.
Editor
.I remember. Methinks, I see in
mind a noble and puissant nation, rousing herself
like a strong man after sleep and shaking her
invincible
locks, &c.
Abbot
.Let us now stroll upon the beach, and
gazing upon the distant city in the evening
sunlight
,
our Poet shall declaim for us Milton's
description
of Athens.
Editor
.The motion is a good one. The
evening
speaks to us very seductively, and Brother
Bonhommie talks of a
late
supperan intimation
with a significance quite as great as that of
Lucullus
,
when he ordered his supper in the Apollo
chamber.
Beauclerk
(aside to Pictor)
I am afraid the
old man heard me. I am monstrously ashamed.
Pictor
(aside to B.)
No! I think not. I am
sure not.
Beauclerk
.Yet he spoke of the very subject.
Pictor
.Which he would
not
have done had
he heard you. Be at ease, and repent of your
error
with what speed you may.
XV.
Editor
.You were interrupted, Father, while
speaking of the projected Hotel upon the Island.
You spoke of your
prevision
in regard to it. We
are now upon the western edge of the Curlew
Ground, where it seems to me, the best site could
be found for such an establishment.
Abbot
.It is the very spot that has been
chosen
,
my sonthat
will be
chosen, I should say.
I am speaking now of that which is yet in the
womb of the future. Eight acres have been
selected
at this point, which are ample for this
purpose; and I rejoice to say, that the
subscriptions
made already, realize the estimated amount
of the expenditure for such an establishment. Our
men of substance have come out manfully, and
more than twenty-two thousand dollars have been
raised for the purpose. Doubtless, ten thousand
more could be easily procured, but the proprietors
will content themselves with five thousand.
Editor
.With such an amount we should have
a very splendid building.
Abbot
.I have already seen the design, my
son, and it will suit in all respects the object. It
will constitute an imposing and beautiful edifice,
rising gracefully upon the spectator coming in
from the sea. The style of the fabric will be at
once simple and showy, somewhat after the style
of architecture at Oran. You shall have a sketch
of it here upon the sand.
You see what a noble colonnade is before you,
covering both stories of the building, from roof to
basement, and extending the extreme length of the
structure, which is full three hundred and fifty
feet. The projection in the centre will be nearly,
perhaps quite, an hundred feet. It will thus
relieve
the uniformity of a range so extensive. The
dome-like elevation from the roof, corresponding
happily with the general style of the building,
contributes
also to the general relief, and constitutes
one of the most grateful features in the plan. Here
my son, is a glorious promenade, from which you
may drink in the breezes from all quarters of the
compass, range with unimpeded vision from East
to West, from North to South, and shift the scene
at pleasure, from sea to land, from shore to forest,
from bright, flashing and rolling breaker, to the
harmonious tints of green umbrageous wood, and
bright, and flower-garnished thicket. With the aid
of glasses of sufficient power, you will be allowed
to look upon the bathers at Cape May, and, by a
twist of the same instrument, you may see the
toilsome workers after the picturesque, as they
shout from the top of the Stone Mountain to the
fair damsels who are content to look up from
below
.
I hold it, my son, not impossible to realize
all these prospects from our Island Belfry, always
assuming the powers of the telescope, and the
imagination
of the gazer, to be equal to so
magnificent
a survey. For persons of moderate fancy, a
view of the harbor will be sufficiently compensative.
I need scarcely call your attention to the scene
immediately before us. Its exquisite grace and
beauty are unquestionable. I see that Sir Charles
Lyell has recently been pleased to acknowledge
it. He is a man of taste and decency, as well as
a Geologist. Certainly, so far as nature is
concerned
,
no son of Carolina need go out of
Charleston
harbor for a noble ocean prospect. In regard
to the
coup d'il
, she ranks very near
NewYork
,lacking,
it is admitted, the immense
vivacity
,
which results to the latter, from the
crowding
cities and villas, which, upon the two great
rivers at Manhattan, sit picturequely placed in
equal beauty and animation. But, the Bay of
Charleston, almost immediately upon the sea,
the waters of the great deep rolling into the doors
of her habitationsshe springing, sudden, like
another Venice, from their embraceher broad
and graceful rivers Ashley and Cooper (Keawah
and Etiwan) clasping her, with murmurs of
affection
,
in their arms, ere they pass away to the gulf
in which they are swallowed up and lostthe
green stripes of shore that stretch away on either
hand, and, sloping off to the sea, contrast
exquisitely
with the silver of its glancing billowsthe
grey islets that lie between these and the ocean,
the fortresses that crown the whole with imposing
moral associationsthe queenly city in the midst,
the deep, dark, foliage in the back ground,these
are all, in such beautiful relationship,in
themselves
how beautifulthat it needs nothing but a
becoming faith in themselves, and in the material
possessed by our native artists, to furnish them
with a thousand scenes of loveliness and grace,
such as Doughty has made to live for ever upon
the canvass.
N
Editor
.You are quite right, Father, in the
appreciation of the prospect. I feel that I have
undervalued it until now.
Abbot
.So have we all, my son. I contend
that our entire Low Country, resourceless as it
hath hitherto appeared to the vulgar sightseeker,
up to the first
steppes
of the mountain region, is
abundantly provided with characteristics,
peculiar
to itself, of grace, animation and beauty,
without
the advantage of a single mountain. But it
is for the painter of
detail
, rather than of
outline
,
to distinguish and relieve it from the cumbrous
masses of the forest, and the unimposing
uniformity
of place. In other words, it must be the
student
of scenery, and not the mere
sightseeker
,
to delineate such portraits. We have had, we
have now, living artists, to whom the discovery
of these beauties would be easy. Let me not
forget in this connection, the happy talent of one
who is no longer with us. Trouche was the very
painter for such scenes. The swamp and forest
scenery of the lower country, had infused itself
into his very nature. He dreamed it, and he
painted
accordingly. He has left too many pictures
unpainted: called away too soon, himself young,
and young in all the impulse of his art. Had
Touche found a patron, twenty years ago, in some
liberal man of fortune, had he been put to a stern
apprenticeship of taste and genius, how would
he have honored his patronhow done honor to
his country! He was undoubtedly a man of
genius
,
whom we did not sufficiently honor.
Editor
.Do you know, Father, that there is
still extant a small collection of cabinet sketches
by CoramViews on Ashley and Cooper Rivers,
most of them mere outlinesstudies for future
use, rather than pictures, which prove the
susceptibilities
of these views?
Abbot
.I have seen them. In the hands of a
painter of talent these sketches, even now, might
be elaborated with the most admirable effect. I
wish that we could persuade Fraser to address
his pencil to materials so easy of access, so
grateful
to the genius
loci
, and so worthy of his grace
and exquisite finish. By the way, my son, you
should see two beautiful things, recently from his
easel, entitled Still and Running Water.
They are the sweetest things I have seen for
many a day. I confess to lusting after them.
When I think of them I violate the
commandment
.
But let us descend from our imaginary
perch to the ground floor of our Hotel.
Having
past through the front colonnade the building
opens in the centre into an ample hall. This, in
turn, opens upon a ball-room on either side, the
dimensions of each of which are
one hundred and
ten
by
thirty
feet. These ball rooms may be
united with the hall, making the grandest of all
saloons for state occasionsthe arrival of
emigrant
Princes, Ex-Presidents, or a visit from the
entire order of the Monks of the Moon. I have
great pleasure in informing you that I am already
in receipt of a communication from the proprietors
of the Hotel, which advises me that an apartment
shall always be held in reserve for the fraternity,
and that the freedom of the establishment shall be
N2
accorded to the Father Abbot, the only condition
annexed to his privileges being the performance,
at proper seasons, of the duty of the Chaplain.
After this, I need not pass any eulogies upon the
taste, the good sense, or the liberality of these
excellent gentlemen. They have an eye to merit;
they know what is due to literature and the fine
arts. They feel, with a proper sense, that they
have in hand a work which appeals to the higher
graces of society; that they are providing, in fact,
for the
elite
of the Southits wealth, beauty,
fashion and intellect. In this connection, I may
add, that a very civil request has been made,
through me, to our brethren, that they will
prepare
a series of studies, from Southern History
and tradition, for original
tableaux vivants
. They
are properly sick of the stale repetitions of Dukes
and Marquisses; Macbeths and Hamlets; Queens
and Shepherdesses; Turks and Banditti. I have
already considered the subject, and have
designed
more than one hundred studies, from Carolina
history alone, each of which, in a dramatic
representation
,
would bring down all the thunders of
the house. In this Hotel, the
tableaux
can be
arranged
,
privately, in either of the ball rooms, the
spectators occupying the hall.
Editor
.Verily, Father, our proprietors
design
the thing handsomely. They have
wondrously
risen in my esteem.
Abbot
.And with reason. But to proceed.
Back of the hall is the
office
of the Hotel,
occupying
a recess which opens upon the piazza in the
rear, and which, on three sides, is surrounded
by a spacious court. On the extreme right of the
front, is a spacious
parlor
for the ladies, in the
rear of which, occupying
one hundred
, by
thirty-eight
or
forty
feet of the eastern wing of the
building
,
is the
Dining Saloon
a hall large enough
for a hecatomb. I have not before told you of
these
wings;
which are spacious buildings in
themselves. They stretch from either end of the
main building, one hundred and twenty feet, the
colonnade covering them in like manner with the
front, and connected with it. In the rear of the
dining room is a
pantry
, to which the fraternity
is to have a pass key. The inner area of the
building is sheltered by its piazzas extending its
entire surface. The
chambers
number
one
hundred
and five
, and are no miserable little closets,
such as serve painfully to remind a man of the
narrow limits of that last chamber which he needs;
but are such as the climate requiresample, cool,
well ventilated and sheltered by be colonnade
from the direct entrance of the sun. The beds
are all on springs, elastic always, and, therefore,
cool; and West Indian Hammocks, of strongly
plainted cane, it is suggested will still afford to the
sleeper the choice of swinging, or simply rolling
himself into the embrace of Morpheus. A
grand
passage
divides the double ranges of rooms, by
passing through the centre of the building its
entire
length. From the Eastern wing of the
building
extends a covered way which conducts you
to the
Bathing Hall
. This is designed to be
sufficiently
large to accommodate Diana and all her
Nymphs. Here,
Douches
and
Shower Baths
,
N3
ropes pendant, swings, and other agencies,
borrowed
from the Gymnasium, are to be furnished,
enabling the virgin beauty to frolic through
Summer hour, in the two-fold embraces of
sea and air. Hither, no miserable Acton can
penetrate; no Arcadian Damon pop into sight,
unadvisedly, to apostrophize his unconscious
mistress
on the scantiness of her wardrobe. Here,
all is to be lulling security and sweetness; a
delicious
retreat and shelter, soft and dreamy, as any
furnished by Thompson, in the castle and domain
of Indolence.
Editor
.'Pon my soul, Father the prospect is
a delicious one.
Abbot
.You may well say so; but this is not
all. Our excellent proprietors know well, how
much the virtues of society depend upon its
amusements. They know, that where we fail to
provide the young with innocent amusements, the
devil will take precious good care to see that they
have others of his own choosing. They know
that nature craves and will have amusement,
whether as a relief from labor, a physical
exercise
,
or the satisfaction of mental curiosity. They
have, accordingly, allotted apartments in this same
neighborhood, to a Bowling Saloon, and Billiards.
Here, then when the lady has had her
cue
,
and exercised herself as much as she desires,
she disappears amid the placid waters, and is
nerved and strengthened for new trials of skill,
by their refreshing embraces. Here, pleasure
ministers to proper exercise; to purification,
purification
to repose; repose to health; and a joyous
re-appearance with the morrow's sunshine, on the
part of the damsel, brings the moral and the
physical
world together in the happiest unison. As
Chaucer writes itshowing the coincidence
between
Light and Beauty
Uprose the sun, and uprose Emily.
Editor
.Our conference, Father, was
interrupted
on a previous occasion, when we were
discussing
the proper name to be given to such a
Hotel
.
In your absence, the Brethren continued
the subject. Beauclerk proposed, The Island
House; Bonhommie, the Rutledge House;
Benison, the Summer Retreat; Beauregard,
the Marion or Moultrie, Gadsden or
Pinckney.
Abbot
.And you?
Editor
.I was divided between Rutledge and
Moultrie, but remembering what you had said,
on the subject of the inappropriateness of the
names, I forbore.
Abbot
.And, our Poet?
Editor
.He said nothing.
Abbot
.Ah! he could feel this unfitness. His
veneration never allows him to vulgarise, by too
much frequency, the thing he honors. I am afraid
that our opinions will have but little avail, since it
is whispered that the child is already christened
Moultrie. I confess that I am sorry for this.
It is our infirmity here, that we ring the changes
quite too frequently upon a favourite name. Here,
now, is Fort Moultrie, the Village is Moultrie,
N5
and the Hotel is to be called Moultrie.
Nobody
honors Moultrie's worth and public services
more than I do; but I cannot see the propriety of
these iterations. Moultrie's great distinction was
the defence of the Fortress which properly bears
his name. I should have been content with this.
Certainly, however, when the village received the
same name, it should have been enough. If the
defence of the Fort still demanded such
expressions
of gratitude, something surely was due to
Rutledge, by whose orders, by whose determined
will, the Fort was defended, even in spite of the
commanding general, Charles Lee, who insisted
that it should be given up. I will cut off my
right arm, said Rutledge, before I will write
such an order! But we scarcely honor a great
man, by christening a hotel after him. If hotels
are to be named after persons, I should prefer to
honor thus, some individual who had distinguished
himself in the
cuisine
. The inventor of a famous
sauce might thus be honored. Monsieur Ude, for
example, or Hannah Glass, would be proper
claimants
for selection. Certainly, the
objects of the
house
, should be considered in its designation
Moultrie, Marion, Sumterare all good names for
ships of war and fortresses. Let us keep them for
these higher purposes. Let us not degrade them
by making them unnecessarily frequent. You
remember
the peasant, who gave as a reason for
voting
Aristides into banishment, that he was tired of
continually being reminded of the justice of that
citizen. We, of the low country, have been
offending
our interior by continually insisting upon our
favorites. They are the capital of which we boast
to others, however much we may neglect their
claims at home. It has grown to be a proverb in
the interiorIt is only a Charleston affair. Let
us not offend any prejudices, unless, by so doing,
we can cure them; but this was never recognized
as the proper process. Now, regarding the
objects
of the Hotelits situation, the peculiarities
of the scene, and the latent purposes had in view
by the proprietors, I should have studiously
rejected
the names of persons in this choice. Here
is an establishment beside the seait is the only
great ocean summering place from Cape May
to the Mississippi; it is really the great ocean
refuge of the South, a central point from the
Chesapeake
to the Gulf, as healthy as any place in the
world; very beautiful to the eye; very grateful to
the physique; a point easy of approach, by
railroad
and steamer, from every quarter in the South
the ocean point,
par excellence
, along a thousand
miles of coast! This is the idea to keep in view
while naming the Hotel. Thousands of the people
of the interior who will naturally seek such a
retreat
in summer, have never beheld the ocean.
The idea of its vast wilderness of wave is to them
as vague and imposing as to a low countryman the
idea of a mountain country. They seek it as
an
ocean retreat
, and so I would have named the
Hotel
.
Our Poet, in his poem, descriptive of the
scene, speaking of the village, seems to me to have
hit upon a phrase which would have better suited
than any other, at once novel, euphonious and
highly significantthe Ocean Hamlet; or Ocean
House, or Ocean Retreat, should have been
the name; and names are things. They fall upon
the ear with a force to which we do not yield
sufficient
credit. The ear will tire of a too frequent
name; while the force of an appropriate and
grateful
name will be suggestive of fancies which work
upon the mind with all the strength of an affection.
But enough. I would have had it otherwise.
Editor
.It is evident, Father, that you attach
considerable importance to this establishment.
You regard it for its effects, apart from its obvious
uses?
Abbot
.It is something gained. It is one more
step to our emancipation. It is a gain upon our
former condition. It will do something towards
curing us of that self-disparaging weakness, that
of
absenteeism
. It is the infirmity of a provincial
people that they have no faith in home. Let us
prove that even the follies and fancies of home,
can have their charm quite as well as those of
other people. But the Hotel proves something
more. You remember what is said of that Saint,
I forget which, who, when his head was off,
walked
with it for half a mile under his arm. To prove
that he only took the first three steps, in this
condition
,
is sufficient for my faith. I require you to
prove nothing more. Now, when you show me
Carolina going into her own manufactures, sending
her own ships upon the sea, and providing for her
own people home places for refuge, you show me
the first three steps taken towards an indefinite
progress; and I care nothing then whether she
carries her head under her arm or upon her
shoulders
.
I feel that she must go
ahead
, at all events.
The progress is begun. The apathy is at an end.
There is no more stagnation; and even a thunder
storm may be considered grateful, as it relieves
the atmosphere, and shows the presence of a real
and active principle of life. Our ships now move
daily over the waters. Our harbors resound with
the volumes of escaping steam. Never was there
more competition for our trade. And our steam
shuttles begin to make such a music, as guarantees
us against a little more folding of the hands to
slumber. Be sure that other sounds and signs
will follow, significant equally of pleasure and
business
.
This little bridge uniting Haddrell and
the Island must be built. Our country friends
from Columbia, Camden, Augusta and Greenville,
will demand it. You have no ideas of the
beauties
of the country to which it will conduct
leading
you to the banks of the Wando, and affording
a thousand pleasant rambles and retreats to the
summer idler. You will probably have a railway
from this very Hotel to Mount Pleasant, where it
looks down from its yellow hills upon the City,
and where I hope soon to see more than one
Cotton
Factory in full blast. All these points and
headlands, these islets and promontories, will
become
,
as I have said before, gay and lovely
hamlets
adorning the harbor. We will pass from point
to pointfrom river to river, and I feel sure that
you will see among other improvements, a noble
bridge spanning the broad Ashley itself, and
uniting
the Neck to St. Andrew's Parishthe very
region which should be covered with smiling farms
and marked by the most productive tillage.
Editor
.A bridge across the Ashley, Father?
Abbot
.And why not?
Editor
.One would suppose, Father, that the
unsatisfactory result of the first, and most
expensive
experiment, would suffice to discourage all
further enterprises of this sort.
Abbot
.Really, I see not why it should. A
bridge was built, and blown away, in one of the
most destructive gales that was ever witnessed.
Should that discourage from future efforts? We
know that ships, by the hundreds, are annually
lost at sea, in squall and tempest. But who
acknowledges
this as a sufficient reason to forego the
future building of merchantmen and men of war?
Hurricanes and tornadoes have swept the very
bed of Ashley river and the harbor to the bottom.
One of peculiar terror and power is recorded by
our early historians. It laid the ocean bare to its
secret gulfs, and many noble ships were torn from
their anchorage, and scattered in wreck and
fragment
along the shores. But what merchant ever
dreams of avoiding the usually safe harborage of
the bay of Charleston? There is nothing in the
objection to a new bridge over the Ashley, because
of the destruction of the old one. But the old
bridge deserves no mention for another reason. It
was a miserable trap-stick affair, badly conceived
and badly built. I have it from old inhabitants,
that it swayed perceptibly with the waves, even
before it was torn up by the tempest. The piles
were never driven below the mud. Modern
science
,
and improved experience, would not be
content
with such an apology for a bridge. We
should now drive our piles, shod with iron for the
purpose, deep down into the marl itself, which
forms the rocky and fast bed of the river. You
have seen, the newly invented machine for driving
piles, worked by steam, which is even now
employed
upon the causeway of the bridge, in
repairing
it? The ranging timber, sticks forty feet in
length, and of corresponding thickness, are
grasped
by the iron antenn of the instrument, are
whirled aloft, without effort, and are driven down
by a relentless stroke from a mall weighing
eighteen
hundred pounds. The shaft
must
go down
must
bury itself in the marlor must be shivered
into splinters. It cannot help but take steadfast
root in the rocky basin, and the tempest that tears
it up must tear up the very bed of the river.
Editor
.But such a bridge, Father, must be
very expensive. Where is the money to come
from?
Abbot
.Not so expensive as you may imagine.
I understand that there are enterprising and
ingenius
architects prepared already to undertake the
work: prepared to contract for its full
performance
,
at a cost not exceeding
sixty thousand
dollars
.
Editor
.Can this be possible?
Abbot
.It is true! You will scarcely ask
where such a sum is to be found. I can tell you,
my son, that the money is ready for the work, and
can be forthwith coming, in three weeks, if
necessary
.
It needs but the movement; nothing more
than the first step made in the business, and the
performance follows. And it should have been
done long ago. The old bridge, if am rightly
instructed
,
worthless as it was, cost at least
one
hundred and twenty thousand dollars
, raised almost
in the infancy of our commerce. What ought we
to do now, when our harbor is crowded with new
and splendid sea steamers from every great port
in the Union. When an immense line of railways,
brings us to the trade of a measureless interior;
and when a noble enterprise is already planning
that which is necessary to the full success of our
effortsa direct steam intercourse with the great
maritime cities of Europe? My son, the City of
Charleston should link herself directly with every
neighborhood, which can be made tributary to the
farmer and the grazier. This country, south of
us in particular, is admirably endowed with rich
soils and a most fructifying climate, for the
purposes
of tillage. It is the natural tributary of the
City. The whole of it, in process of time, those
portions only excepted which are specially
adapted
to the culture of rice and the finer cottons
will be converted into farms; the production of
which will not only render us independent of our
Northern and Western neighbors, as respects
grain, forage, vegetables, butter and cattle, but
will be able to supply the earlier productions of
the spring and summer, through the means of
daily steamboats, to the cities of the North. We
know how large, comparatively speaking, is the
business already done in this respect. But the
increase will be absolutely immeasurable and
incomputable
,
when improved facilities to market
shall have persuaded our planters along the
Ashley
and the Stono, to embark in the more
lucrative
business. What must be the effect of this,
but the increased value of lands in these quarters,
and a denser population? With a denser
population
,
comes drainage; and, with improved
agriculture
,
the use and absorption, into manures, of
all refuse vegetable matter. Here we behold the
the secret of salubrity in soil and climate; and
all St. Andrew's may be made quite as healthy as
Charleston and the Neck. What farther follows,
from the introduction of this new system? Why,
that the City builds up its back country
population
at its own doors; and the State keeps within
its own limits, diffused among its own people, the
hundreds of thousands,nay millions,which we
annually send abroad for commodities, all of which
ought to be raised at home. The money which
you send North and West, for grain, forage,
butter
,
potatoes horses, mules and cattle, never knows
returning ebb. Not a dollar ever comes back to
us. But, if we can create a population at our
own back doors, which shall supply these
commodities
,
all this money finds its way
necessarily
to the City, which can never fear a
competitor
as the domestic market of the State. Convert
the lower districts into a farming region, with a
tolerably dense population, and you save two
millions annually to the State, which we now send
out never to return. The Bridge over Ashley
will contribute largely to this result. It is one
of the most important steps in the career of local
improvement. It supersedes a most tedious and
expensive mode of travel. It invites and opens
the way to travel; and other improvements
hereafter
,
to continue from this, may even bring you
a large and valuable wagon trade, from the
middle
counties of Georgia along the Savannah River.
Editor
.Certainly, the present mode of
ferriage
,
its expensiveness and frequent and vexatious
delays, have led to the temporary abandonment,
by the people of the interior, of one of the most
delightful and eligible roads conducting to the
City.
Abbot
.No doubt of it. The complaints are
endless in respect to the present system. Suppose
you confine your view to the simple andvantages
of
a drive
across the river and into the country?
You may visit the Stono; you may stroll through
the venerable precincts of St. Andrew's Church;
you may take your dinner at Rantoule's, catch
your own fish, and be back in the City in season
for an early supper. And this over one of the
finest
roads in our low countrythrough most
splendid natural avenues, in sight of lovely
farmsteads
,
with the fruits of the season inviting you
at every step, the song of birds to welcome you
with music, and the gayest wild flowers to regale
your eyes with beauty, and your nostrils with
perfume
.
Only make the passage of the Ashley
certain
,
at all hours, and make it cheap, and all the
neighboring country becomes a garden; the farms
become subdivided, cultivation becomes thorough,
and the soil, under a good manuring system, is
made to develope resources such as will surpass
all expectation. The materials for vegetable
manures
are enormous through all this region. The
miserable error, of which our people have been
guilty, in all times past, has been that they
destroyed
the value of their workstheir luxuries
and necessaries alike, by the excessive prices which
they put upon their enjoyment and use. They
charged as if they were determined always to
make the consumer feel that they were luxuries;
overlooking the fact that no man, not even the
wealthiest, lives habitually on luxuries. The
proper
process was to make the luxuries necessaries.
This could only be done by making them cheap.
When the
New Bridge
was opened, a natural
curiosity led the carriage of the citizen, once or
twice, across its arches, at a cost of a couple of
dollars the trip! How often, at such a price, could
he indulge in such a pleasure? Cupidity, like
ambition, thus too frequently defeats its own
objects
.
While one citizen made the journey at this
expense, a hundred who would have relished it
also, were compelled to turn up their noses, and
cry sour grapes. But what would be the
effect
,
think you, in regard to the uses of such a
O
bridge across the Ashley, if the four-wheel
carriage
paid twenty-five cents, and the two-wheel half
that price; the horseman a fourth; and the foot
passenger, but three cents; leaving the heavy
wagon to pay fifty cents, and the loaded cart
twenty-five
?
Why, the whole City would throng into
St. Andrew's. Each would have his turn and
come often. As a drive, and as a walk, it would
become equally fashionable; and there is no
pleasure
so grateful to man as that which he enjoys
under the reflection that his indulgence trenches
upon no resources which can be illy spared from
his necessities. I would guarantee the stock, the
bridge costing not more than $60,000, as the very
best in the country.
Editor
.Ah! Father, shall we, indeed, realize
these glowing predictions?
Abbot
.Why not? I tell you, my son, the
ball is in motion. Our people have shaken off
their slumbers, and it is one of the inevitable
characteristics
of a popular progress, that, once fairly
begun, it goes through its cycle of performance,
for fifty years at least, before it sleeps again. The
truth is, a great moral amalgam has taken place
in our society, the affinities of which enforce
progress
.
You will live to see the promise realized.
You will behold the City, and all its tributary
islets, and shores, and waters, and fountains, linked
together by indissoluble bands of iron. You will
see this goodly city, seated by the sea, sending
forth her messengers, winged by steam and sail,
to the remote and mighty cities of the old world!
You will see the internal resources of our vast
interior
finding their way to profitable exchanges,
through this medium. You will see our people,
instead of gaping at foreign towns and crowded
cities of the East, listless, and without hope or
occupation
,
concentrating all their energies, whether
for business or pleasure, in and about the sacred
precincts of home. There shall they discover, not
only that they have a business to execute, a
profitable
labor and a duty which love delights in,
but pleasures to enjoy, more exquisite, and more
legitimate, than any that could be found abroad.
We have discoursed in vain upon these subjects,
my son, if it is needful that I should recapitulate
our frequent conversations. But my words are so
many prophecies. The work is fairly begun, and
our people are rapidly discovering the Home
Secretthe secret of true worth, true wealth,
true pleasure, and true virtue. Let us return.
Our Brother Bonhommie signals us from Prospect
Hill.
XVI.
The night was one of eminent beauty. The
winds were light but lively. The moon,
unembarrassed
by a clond, was making her smiling way
through the heavens; and the broad expanse of
ocean, smooth as a lawn of silver, lay basking in
her beams. The gay sands were glistering with
a thousand pleasant fires. The village of
Moultrie
stretched away towards the West, showing
O2
like a fairy hamlet; while a solitary light
revealed
the distant City, sleeping serenely beneath
the guardian watch of her ascending steeples.
Immediately
in the rear of Prospect Hill, a green
and grateful stretch of forest lay in shadow, but
not gloomily, touched, as were the tops of its oaks
and myrtles, with the hallowing wand of
moonlight
.
Such was the scene to which we were
summoned by our considerate host and Brother,
Bonhommie. He had spread his table for supper
on the little white eminence of Prospect Hill, its
brows partially encircled by a little coronet of
myrtles. We shall not describe the supper, which
was served in the best style of a taste that knew
admirably how to mingle the delicate and the
persuasive
in his feasts. Coffee and tea were the
essential spirits, and the venerable maid,
Estifania
,
who keeps the keys at our Brother's
farmstead
,
had shown herself singularly ambitious of
securing the favor of the fraternity, being
particularly
desirous of the patriarchal blessing at the
hands of our Holy Father Abbot. Her
beverages
were unexceptionable, and the
accompanying
cakes and cates, won the general approbation.
Our Father was sad, however, and did not dilate
with his usual fervor. It is probable that he has
felt disquieted at the prospect of soon departing
from a scene which we had all enjoyed with a
pleasure
having no qualifications. The same
sentiment
prevailed somewhat with the rest of the
brotherhood
.
Beauclerk, in especial, was evidently
humbled by remorse, at the unnatural feeling
which had possessed him, though for a moment
only, in regard to the Father Abbot. He was, no
doubt, troubled by an anxious apprehension, lest
the Father should have heard his language after
dinner, in which he showed himself restive under
that paternal authority which had kept his wild
impulses in check. But there was no gloom in
the assembly, as there was no asceticism in the
speech of the Holy Father. The supper was
gratefully discussed, and Brother Bonhommie was
the happiest of men, at the tribute paid to his
taste and hospitality. He absolutely wept when
he heard the Father remind the brotherhood that
the next morning was the time appointed for their
departure from the Island. It is impossible to
describe his satisfaction, however, the moment
after, when one of the brethren reminded the
Father
that the next day was the Sabbath.
Abbot
.Then we shall remain another day,
my children; and, with brother Bonhommie's
permission
,
we shall discourse to the fraternity in the
sacred groves which lie east of his dwelling.
Bonhommie
.Every thing shall be prepared,
Father, for the occasion. At an early hour, chairs
shall be carried out for the purpose. There is a
peculiar sweetness and solemnity in hearkening to
the words of truth and soberness in the deep
silence of sheltering woods.
Poet
.The groves, we are told, were God's
first temples.
Abbot
.Thou hast a hymn, dear son,
descriptive
of the Forest Worship. It shall be chaunted
on the occasion. It is one particularly suited to
the purpose; and as all discourse should be
appropriate
,
O3
not only to the spiritual, but to the
human
condition of man, adapted not only to his
particular
nature, but to the circumstances and
necessities
of his life, so will I endeavor to encourage
our Brother Bonhommie in the career which he
has so lately taken up, by dilating upon the
characteristics
and essential attributes of The Good
Farmer.
Beauclerk
.Don't you think, Father, that
brother Bonhommie might establish here a
successful
vineyard? Don't you think that the vine
ought to flourish here on the side of the sandy
hillocks?
Abbot
.Undoubtedly: and the suggestion is
worthy of consideration. There is one law which
should encourage frequent experiment in
agriculture
.
It is found in the fact that
it is in the soul
of man
, rather than the soil in which he works,
that his fruits must first flourish. And it is
difficult
to say what climate or situation could prove
itself inaccessible to the determined energies of
the human intellect. The mind is remarkable in
no respect more than by its so readily
accommodating
itself to the most adverse scenes and
situations
.
Received directly from Divinity, designed,
in however remote a degree, to resemble the
nature
of the Deity himself, it is of that commanding
and conquering quality, as to subject all soils and
all circumstances to its imperial progress. It
adapts the man to all climates, and may in like
manner, adapt the fruits of all climates to the
particular
situation in which his lot has been cast.
The earth and all its creatures were decreed to
obey his will. No skies can repel or discourage,
no condition always baffle, or entirely defeat, the
man of equal thought and energy. Unite these,
and it is wonderful how much the individual may
achieve to his own astonishment.
Poet
.The history of the vine itself, Father,
will abundantly illustrate this truth.
Abbot
.Yes, indeed! If any sceptic among
us shall apprehend that cold and capricious
seasons
here, will discourage the vegetation, and
defeat
the growth, of the rich and delicate fruits
born under the blue skies and generous suns of
of Italy and France, let him hear the account of
these same fruits from the eloquent pen of Gibbon.
He tells us that it would be almost impossible
to enumerate all the articles, either of the animal
or vegetable region, which were successfully
imported
into Europe from Asia and Egypt. Almost
all the flowers, the herbs and the fruits, that grow
in the European garden, are of foreign extraction.
The apple was a native of Italy, and when the
Romans had tasted of the rich flavor of the
apricot
,
the peach, the pomegranate, the citron and
the orange, they contented themselves with
applying
to all these new fruits the common
denomination
of apple, discriminating them from each other
by the additional epithet of the country. In the
time of Homer, the vine grew wild in the Island
of Sicily, and most probably, in the adjacent
continent
,
but it was not improved by the skill, nor
did it afford a liquor grateful to the taste, of the
savage inhabitants. A thousand years afterwards,
Italy could boast that of the fourscore most
generous
O5
and celebrated wines, more than two-thirds
were produced from her soil. The blessing was
soon communicated to the Narbonnese province of
Gaul; but so intense was the cold to the north of
the Cevennes, that, in the time of Strabo, it was
thought impossible to ripen the grapes in those
parts of Gaul. This difficulty, however, was
gradually
vanquished; and there is some reason to
believe, that the vineyards of Burgundy are as old
as the age of the Antonines. The olive in the
western world followed the progress of peace, of
which it was the symbol. Two centuries after
the foundation of Rome, both Italy and Africa
were strangers to that useful plant. It was
naturalized
in those countries, and at length carried
into the heart of Spain and Gaul. The timid
errors
of the ancients, that it required a certain
degree
of heat, and could only flourish in the
neighborhood
of the sea, were insensibly exploded by
industry and experience. The cultivation of flax
was transported from Egypt to Gaul, and enriched
the whole country, however it might impoverish
the particular lands on which it was sown. The
use of artificial grasses became familiar to the
farmers
both of Italy and the Provinces, particularly
the Lucerne, which derived its name and origin
from Medea. The assured supply of wholesome
and plentiful food for the cattle during winter,
multiplied the number of the flocks and herds,
which, in their turn, contributed to the fertility of
the soiland so forth.
Bonhommie
.Is it impossible! How
encouraging
,
all this, dear Father, to a young beginner!
Beauclerk
.Brother Bonhommie has now a
motive and a duty, at once before him. What a
glorious triumph, if he shall succeed in covering
those sand hills with the Scuppernong and the
Isabella grapes. And why should he not? The
whole southern slope of this range, might be made
to flourish with the vine, which, springing up in
the soil in the opposite side, would readily
clamber
over to this.
Bonhommie
.I shall certainly try it.
Beauclerk
.I have seen the Malaga, Father,
produce fruit in our interior in four years after the
planting of the seed.
Bonhommie
.I shall try them all.
Abbot
.And you will do well. The duty of
the good farmer is frequent experiment
experiment
so urged as not to interfere with his regular
operations, yet so fairly urged as to leave him in
no doubt as to the soundness of his conclusions.
The whole chapter which Gibbon devotes to this
department of Roman economy, will well reward
perusal. There is much even in this brief passage
which deserves our consideration. If we do not
suffer those
timid errors
of which he speaks, to
keep us in perpetual bondage to the circumscribed
condition of our present agriculture, we shall
probably
discover that our soil and climate are quite
as congenial to the introduction of foreign products
as those of any portion of the ancient world. We
have, indeed, every variety of soil and surface.
The aspects of our country, in the three grand
divisions
of the State, are sufficiently diversified for
every form of cultivationand we are already
rich in native and exotic productions, which only
need that art should do her duty, in compliance
with the suggestions of nature, to make them equal
to any like objects of culture, in any other portion
of the world. But we must beware of that timid
ignorance which does nothing, under the
convenient
belief, which is always the argument of the
slothful, that nothing can be done. Nothing is
done, and nothing can be done, by those who
doubt the ability of manman, the appointed
agent of God on earthto do all things that God
has ever yet permitted man to do. The earth is
ours by the Eternal Bountybut she does not
yield up her treasures to the timid or the base.
She has no fruits for the slothful. We must
grapple
her to our arms with a manly vigor, and
compel
the surrender of her virgin treasures.
Poet
.What says the Roman Poetthe
agricultural
moralist of Rome in the Augustan period?
Not to dull ignorance, or transient toil,
Great Jove vouchsafed the conquest of the soil;
He bade sharp care make keen the heart, nor deigned
That sloth should linger where his God had reigned.
Abbot
.Appropriately quoted, my son. Let
us not forget, in referring to the passage taken
from Gibbon, that the regions of France and Spain
which were considered so unfriendly to the grape
and the olive, are those very regions from which
we now receive these fruits in the greatest
perfection
.
The rich red wines of Burgundy, come from
those very grapes which, it was feared, could not
be ripened under the severely cold temperature of
that region: and Spain and France are now
ranked
among the favorite and native gardens of the
olive. Gibbon remarks that, in the time of Homer,
the vine grew wild in Sicily, but that it was not
improved by the skill, nor did it afford a liquor
grateful to the tastes of the savage inhabitants.
Could the vine grow more luxuriously, could it
twine itself anywhere more lasciviously around
the forest trees, than in Carolina and Georgiain
greater abundance, or in more fruitful variety?
Impossible! our swamp and forest margins are
wondrous to behold, at the opening of spring, and
in the maturing embraces of the summer, in their
luscious and liberal exhibitions of every sort of
wild grape. Let us not expose ourselves to the
bitter sarcasm which Gibbon inflicts upon the
Sicilians
.
How keenly would our children, of the
seventh and tenth generation, feel the reproach of
the Historian, who, a hundred years hence, might
relate that, in the time of President Taylor, under
the local administrations of Governors Seabrook,
of South-Carolina, and Towns, of Georgia, the
vine grew wild in these and other States of the
great American Confederacy, particularly in the
Southern portions, but was not improved by the
skill, nor did it afford a liquor grateful to the tastes
of the savage inhabitants.
Editor
.He might add that, in more
Northern
latitudes, naturally less favorable to its
growth, it was rendered more successful, nay,
made to produce in abundance, under the
working
and restless energies of a people, who were
compelled to supply, with constant industry, the
deficiencies of a sterile soil and an unfriendly
climate
.
The Scuppernong, a native of the South,
receives its more successful culture in the North;
while Ohio is already manufacturing more
Champagne
in one season, than France exports in a
dozen.
Poet
.I am afraid, Father, that the
wonderful
developments of gold in California will
materially
serve to injure our agriculture.
Abbot
.I hope not. I think not. It is only
the diseased appetite, that is drawn away from
the homestead by such temptations; the feverish
discontent, the hungering thirst, that would
seldom
have done any good at home; and most of
these poor adventurers will be wrecked and ruined
in their search. It will require wonderful
energies
,
and still more wonderful capacities of
endurance
,
to succeed in the mines of California; and
success itself is destined, with the greater number,
to produce the bitterest fruits, like those fabulous
apples of Sodom, lovely and luscious to the eye,
but full of dust and ashes within. What a
delusion
is this search!
Poet
.An age of Gold?
Abbot
.Iron, rather, my son! We must not
confound a figure with a fact. In the
imaginative
world, gold serves the purpose of a noble
illustration. In the actual, it only degrades the
imagination.
Beauclerk
.Was there ever a period which
could properly deserve the name of the age of
Gold?
Abbot
.I think so! Yes! The period fanci
fully denominated the age of gold, was not
one of simple fiction. It had its date and
existence
,
without doubt, in the progress of every
primitive
nation. It was unquestionably that period
when the great majority of mankind was
engaged
in agriculturewhen there was no strife of
commercial enterprisewhen the jealousies of
trade provoked not to war, and its attractions

none from the paths of industrybefore
cunning had sapped the strength from manhood,
and baseness had corrupted the soul of
magnanimity
!
Agriculture, being expressly a divine
institution
,
had the natural effect of subduing the
passions of men, of regulating their appetites,
promoting gentleness, harmony, and universal
peace among them. The earth was enriched by
judicious cultivation, and the population of the
world was necessarily and proportionately
increased
as Cowper writes:
Their harvests over swell
The sower's hopes: their trees o'erladen, scarce
Their fruit sustain; no sickness thins the folds:
The finny swarms of ocean crowd the shores,
And all are rich and happy.
The principles of agriculture were simple,
exceedingly
.
That they might be made so, God,
himself, was the great first planter.

Milton
The Sovran Planter.
He wrote
its laws, visibly, in the brightest, and loveliest,
and most intelligible characters, everywhere, upon
the broad bosom of the liberal earth; in greenest
leaves, in delicate fruits, in beguiling and balmy
flowers! But he does not content himself with
this alone. He bestows the heritage along with
the example. He prepares the garden and the
home, before he creates the being who is to
possess
them. He fills them with all those objects of
sense and sentiment which are to supply his moral
and physical necessities. Birds sing in the boughs
above him, odors blossom in the air, and fruits
and flowers cover the earth with a glory, to which
that of Solomon in all his magnificence, was vain
and valueless. To His hand we owe these fair
groves, these tall ranks of majestic trees these
deep forests, these broad plains covered with
verdure, and these mighty arteries of flood and
river, which wind among them, beautifying them
with the loveliest inequalities, and irrigating them
with seasonable fertilization. Thus did the
Almighty
Planter dedicate the great plantation to
the uses of that various and wondrous family
which was to follow. His home prepared
supplied
with all resources, adorned with every
variety
of fruit and flower, and checkered with
abundance
,
man is conducted within its pleasant limits,
and ordained its cultivator under the very eye
and sanction of Heaven. The angels of Heaven
descend upon its hills; God, himself appears
within its vallies at noondayits groves are
instinct
with life and purity, and the blessed stars
rise at night above the celestial mountains, to keep
watch over its consecrated interests. Its
gorgeous
forests, its broad savannahs, its levels of flood
and prairie, are surrendered into the hands of
the wondrously favored, the new created heir of
Heaven! The bird and the beast are made his
tributaries, and taught to obey him. The fowl
summons him at morning to his labors, and the
evening chaunt of the night bird warns him to
repose. The ox submits his neck to the yoke;
the horse moves at his bidding in the plough;
and the toils of all are rendered sacred and
successful
by the gentle showers and the genial
sunshine
which descend from Heaven, to ripen the
grain in its season, and to make earth pleasant
with its fruits.
Poet
.Verily, that was a golden period, indeed!
Beauclerk
.Gold, itself, unknown! This is
a still more encouraging picture, brother
Bonhommie
.
Remember the grapes!
(aside.)
Abbot
.The origin of agriculture being thus
dignified, the art was pursued by the Grey
Fathers
of the infant earth! Its kings and princes
drove the harrow, and dropped the grain, and
danced, with songs of thanksgiving, around the
harvest. Their exercises continued to ennoble it;
and, for ages, the destinies of the world were
happily
committed to the hands of men, whose chief
distinction lay in their superior use of the sickle
and the ploughshare. These were patriarchal
ages. Toil, then, if a duty, was no less an
unadulterated
blessing. Nothing can exceed the sweetness
which and felicity with the poets expatiate upon
this happy period. They sang, in its praises,
without
qualification, that it gave health to the body,
strength to the frame, energy to the will, and
nobleness
to the purposethat it conducted
temperance
,
pure desires, devout thought, and becoming
patriotismthat it inspired happy feelings among
the people, brought the young together in fruitful
marriage, and blessed the eyes of the patriarchal
fathers with glimpses of a third and fourth
generation
.
These were the very days of Astrathe
days of peace, and sunshine, and innocent myrth;
of a long life of youth, unembittered by disease
health to the last; and when death drew nigh, his
approach was gentle and kind, like that of some
friendly attendant, who lets down the curtains
around us, and soothes us to repose. The toils of
the day in this happy period, were begun and
closed in music. The shepherds led their flocks
over the mountains, to the delicious strains of flute
and flageoletdrew them together by the same
process when they wandered, and, with a like
summons, compelled them to follow homeward at
the approach of evening.
Poet
.Will California ever realize such a
picture
!
Portions of it must have done sothe great
valley of the Sacramentoportions of it without
doubt, but for this terrible discovery of metallic
wealth. Proceed, Father.
Abbot
.Such, no doubt, was the golden age
of every primitive people. Unhappily, it was of
short duration only. Man seems to possess an
inherent
quality of discontent, which perhaps, is one
of the strong proofs, apart from revelation, of the
immortality of the soul. His flute, with which the
shepherd led his flocks to pasture, became, in the
process of time, the agent of a sterner influence.
That which had been the chosen voice of love, now
spoke in louder language at the requisition of hate!
The herdsmen and shepherds, when they became
warriors, went into battle,
In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood,
Of flutes and soft recorders.
Hence the origin of martial music. The
plaintive
notes which had led the shepherds and their
kine, and responded to their doubts and hopes, in
melodious murmurs which betokened gentleness
and peace, were now exchanged for those of
angry
warfare, wild passions, and insatiate ambition.
So violence
Proceeded, and oppression and sword law,
Through all the plain.
The application of an agent, once so innocent,
whose only language, hitherto, had been that of
love, to the purposes of strife and aggression,
betrays
,
of itself, how large and how sudden was
the change which had taken place in the minds
and condition of the people. But this belongs,
seemingly, to the usual, if not the natural order of
events. The age of Iron had succeeded to that of
Gold. Sterner feelings and passions overthrew
the simplicities which had hitherto characterized
the primitive races of the earth; even as the
stronger appetites and desires of the man overgrow
and absorb those, more gentle and limited, which
prevail in the bosom of the child. Change
naturally
follows in the paths of prosperity, and the
very accumulation of wealth occasions new
desires
,
P
and suggests new necessities. When men
had so far advanced in art as to be enabled to
tame and gather within their folds the wild herds
of the plain and prairie, a portion of their
numbers
was necessarily withdrawn from the
cultivation
of the earth and assigned the duties of
herdsmen. These were required to contend with
the yet unsubdued monsters of the wilderness, to
grapple with the Asiatic tiger, the swarthy and
fierce lion of the Numidian deserts, and to level
their sharp arrows at the breast of the vulture of
the Caucasus. The herdsman consequently
became
the hunter, and the use of arms brought
with it a passion for their exercise. The world
soon became filled with a class, of whom Nimrod,
that mighty hunter before the Lord, is a sufficient
sample. The transition was not difficult, from
hunting the wild beast of the forest, to hunting
MAN! and WAR became the next and natural
employment
of the hunter. It was not easy for men,
who had been accustomed, for years, to rove at
will, in pursuit of their prey, to fall back, after
their final conquest of the common enemy, upon
the peaceful and regular employments of
agricultural
life. The occupation was too tame, too
wanting in those excitements, the desire for which
had become habitual, in consequence of their
employment
;
and they yearned for the licentious
pleasures of their wild and warlike pastimes. They
had tasted the sweets of powerthey had
acquired
the appetite for bloodthey felt their strength
knew the weakness of the peaceful and
unsuspecting
farmer, and they selected him as their
victim. He was more profitable as a victim, and
far less to be feared as an enemy, than the lion
of Numidia. The grain was no sooner ripened than
the warlike tribes descended from the mountains
to the plains, and gathered their harvests with
the sword. Vainly did the farmer strive to
defend
his possessions. The savage, inured to arms,
and delighting in their exercise, was necessarily
triumphant. Butchery followed, and the devasted
fields grew fat in the blood of those who could
till them no longer. Who shall predict or limit
the penalties which flow from every departure
from the imperious line of duty? These crimes,
this fatality, were the inevitable result, accruing
from the adoption, by the herdsman, as a trade
and occupation, of one of the incidental necessities
of his condition. The first ordinances of the Deity
were forgotten. The decree of labor, pronounced
by the Creator as a judgment, has ever been borne,
except for the brief and blessed period described
in the Age of Gold, with discontent by the
creature. The herdsman, too gladly becomes the
hunter; the hunter, the warrior; the warrior, the
robber; and the peaceful farmer, who feeds all,
becomes the common victim. Hence, the
desertion
of fields, the depopulation of countries, the
desecration of altars, the famine, the slaughter and
unmitigated misery and devastation on every hand!
In due proportion, as the pursuits of agriculture
become insecure, the races of men decline. This
is the unerring law of God's providence, and the
unerring consequence of man's disobedience. It
cannot well be otherwise; and with the decline
P2
of a population will be the equally certain decline
of prosperity and happiness.
Poet
.We have an apt illustration from
Goldsmith
,
FatherThe Deserted Village.
Ill fares the land to hastening ills the prey,
Where wealth accumulates and men decay;
Princes and Lords may flourish or may fade,
A breath can make them as a breath has made;
But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
When once destroy'd can never be supplied.
Abbot
.It is through this process that most
empires have been overthrown. The simplicity
of the race has been lost, the more innocent
appetites
superseded by such as bring the worst
passions into mastery. Such has been the
common
history. With the lapse of the patriarchal
ages, Asia, the first and loveliest garden of the
earth, became a desert, or something worse;
Africa
,
a land of howling cannibals, which it must
long continue; and when
Beauclerk
.Do you note, Father, the recent
discovery of men with tails in that country?
Abbot
.Yes, my son, but your suggestion
would have kept until I had finished my
sentence
.
Beauclerk
.Hem!
Abbot
.And when, in the progress of
pursuing
centuries, Europe grew maddened with the
perpetual and exhausting strifes between the
spoiler, and the Providence of God vouchsafed
America as a new land of promise, and of refuge
to the fugitive, what was then the melancholy
history? Did the story undergo a change? The
colonists had glimpses there of a golden period of
peace, but it was golden no longer. The iron age
had succeeded to that of gold with the Peruvian
and the Aztec, and the European colonists were
not of a character to make any change from worse
to better. In the region occupied by our
immediate
ancestors they found a wilderness, but it was
not a peaceful one. Even here, the same bitter
seeds had been sown, the same poisonous fruit
eaten, and death was the consequence. The same
inevitable fate had followed the same wilful
disobedience
of mankind. The departure from those
holy laws which enjoined industry and blessed
with abundance, had produced among the red
men of the new world, the same profitless scenes
of strife and carnage which had distinguished the
career of the ancestral nations. It was the
wretched
boast of the American savage, that he was the
conqueror of the country! that he had invaded a
numerous and highly civilized peoplethat he
had ravaged their fields; sacked and destroyed
their walled places; and, having consumed the
common enemy, had, at length, in the absence of
all other victims turned the barbed edges of his
thirsty tomahawk upon his own brother. But
what was the history of the people thus
destroyed
?
Were they wisewere they virtuous? For
what unhappy sins had the Deity delivered them
into the power of their wild invaders? Had they
become inert in the accumulation of superfluous
wealth? Did they disregard the wholesome laws
of their creation? Did famine enfeeble their
energies
;
or, in the sweet peacefulness of a golden
age, that disarmed every domestic enemy, did
they become heedless of those dangers which
might follow the sudden presence of a foreign
one? Perhaps, if we might trace the tale of their
fortunes to its source, it would not be unlike that
of all the rest! There was strife among
themselves
,
which facilitated the progress of the
invader
,
and sharpened his arrows. Faction strove
with faction for the treasures of the
commonwealth
,
or, which is the same, for its control.
Then perished the public liberties. Then labor
became a mercenary, and changed his
ploughshare
for the deadly brand of battle. Then
industry
and art were dispossessed of their fruits,
and so, dishonored; and the city grew rank and
ready for any pollution. When its suburban fields
flourished no longer in smiling yellow, beneath
the mellowing signs of the autumnal heavens, its
golden age was gonegone for ever! Then
was it only fitting that the mountain robber should
descend to the harvest that was ready to his
hands. So long as he heard from its busy streets
the clink of the morning hammer, and beheld the
keen scythe throughout the long hours of the
autumnal day, so long did he tremble to
encounter
the muscular hands which grasped them. But
when these tokens of sure strength and manly
virtue were withdrawn, then did he know that
the age of Iron was begun. Toil had given place
to cunning, and barriers of moral and physical
defence were all swept away.
The story is everywhere the same. It admits
of no variation. The golden age is the age of
agricultural pre-eminence. The nation whose
sons shrink from the culture of its fields, will
wither for long ages under the imperial sway of
Iron. It may put on a face of brass, but its legs
will be made of clay. It may hide its lean cheeks,
and all external signs of its misery, under the
harlotry
of art; but the rottenness of death will be
all the while revelling upon its vitals, and a
poisonous
breath will go forth from its decay, which
will spread its loathsome taint along the shores
of other and happier and unsuspecting nations!
Beauclerk

(aside to Poet)
He has
positively
given us a sermon.
Bonhommie
.Father, I have prepared a little
display of fireworks.
Abbot
.Fireworks! In the moonlight?
Bonhommie
.No, Father, we will descend to
the deep shade of this thicket. Our rockets only
shall be sent up from the hills. You will be
surprised
at the exquisite effect of such a display on
the Island.
Abbot
.I can conceive it, heightened by an
unembarrassed plain of earth and sky, by the free
flight of the breezes, by the broad expanse of
ocean, to say nothing of its wild chaunt, by way
of musical accompaniment. When the new
Hotel
is built, the Town Council will need to make
an appropriation for a display of Pyrotechnics
every fourth of July, and Twenty-Eighth of June.
Lead the way, brother Bonhommie.
Bonhommie
.Take my arm, Father. We will
descend this gorge, from the foot of which I have
opened a private avenue to our little forest. I shall
conduct you through the myrtle labyrinth.
[Ex. Father Abbot, &c.
Manent, Beauclerk and Editor
.
Beauclerk
.Hist, brother Editor. We have
had rather a long siege of itrather a dry
discourse
,
and I need some consolation. Step with
me into this hollow. See what a bower we have
here among the myrtles.
Editor
.What are you after?
Beauclerk
.
(showing a bottle)
Do you see
what fruits these sand hills yield. Said I not that
this was the region for the grape to flourish in.
Editor
.Champagne!
Beauclerk
.A single bottle, which we may
discuss together while our Holy Father gropes
his way through the thickets. He has all the
passion of a school boy for fireworks, and will
not miss us. And nowsmack! It is one of the
drawbacks to the luxury of Champagne that it
will always make due report of its own
excellences
.
Abbot
.
(suddenly reappearing)
Only when
the creature is good, my son! If vain of its
excellence
,
it has grounds for being sonot always
the case with those who consume it. Fill the
glass for your Father, Beauclerk, and
congratulate
yourself that I do not fine you a basket for
this pernicious habit of enjoying your pleasures
selfishly. Take this counsel also, my son, and
be always sure that the master is quite out of
hearing, when you undo the wire.
Beauclerk

(aside)
The Heathen Turk!
The event passed off good humoredly, and the
fire-works brilliantly. We retired early and rose
with the red-bird,rather prematurely awakened
I allow, by the screams of an enormous pea-fowl,
which is one of the pets of Brother Bonhommie.
From the dwelling to the sea was but a bound and
plunge, and we were soon ready for the events of
the day. Breakfast discussed, we adjourned to a
thick copse beneath the sand hills, and there
listened
to a most refreshing discourse from Father
Abbot, as he had promised, on the qualities and
characteristics of the good farmera discourse
fashioned in his peculiar way; and mingling
equally
the practical with the contemplative and
spiritual
.
This discourse was followed by an
admirable
hymn, written by our Poet, descriptive and
laudatory of forest worship. The day was spent
in pleasant and serious conversation of a kind not
unsuited to its equally grateful and sacred import.
The next day witnessed our exodus. It was an
event full of interest and excitement. The Town
Council attended us to the steamer, and we could
see that most of the windows were closed as we
passed the houses, denoting the grief of the
inmates
.
Brother Bonhommie was inconsolable,
and found it impossible to restrain his tears. One
incident must not be forgotten: as we were leaving
the wharf, Truesdell made his appearance,
followed
by a heavy wagon laden with his largest
oysters
,
which he forced upon the fraternity, modestly
contenting himself with asking a blessing at the
hands of the holy Father. This was bestowed
with the grace natural to our reverend head; and
the gratified recipient of the blessing went away
with a grateful heart. The oysters thus provided
served the brotherhood amply at their next solemn
supper. Verily the scene was a solemen one,
indeed
.
It witnessed the resignation of our
excellent
Father. He proceeded the next day, with a
party of the brethren, on an excursion into the
interior
;
and, at last advices, was meditating the
sublime and beautiful along the glorious precipices
of Tallulah. These chronicles have all been taken
by the Recording Secretary, from the volume
numbered 7, lettered the Book of the Island,
in the archives of the Monastery of the Moon.
THE END.
