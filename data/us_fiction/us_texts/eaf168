CHAPTER I.
CAROLINE ARCHER Was the most
beautiful
milliner's apprentice that tripped along
the streets of Philadelphia. She was just
seventeen; with the softest brown hair, that
would
burst into a thousand ringlets over the
neck and shoulders, all she could do to teach
it to lay demurely on her cheek, as a
milliner's
apprentice should do. Her eyes were of
the deepest blue of the June sky after a fine
shower, not that showers often visited her
brilliant orbs, for she was as happy-hearted
as a child, and to sing all day long was as
natural to her as to the robin red-breastat
least it was until she became a milliner's
apprentice
,
when she was forbid to sing by her
austere mistress, as if a maiden's fingers
would not move as nimbly with a cheerful
carol on her tongue. Her smile was like
light, it was so beaming; and then it was so
full of sweetness, and gentle-heartedness!
It was delightful to watch her fine face with
a smile mantling its classical features, and
her coral lips just parted showing the most
beautiful teeth in the world. One could not
but fall in love with her outright at sight
yet there was a certain elevated purity and
dignity about her that checked lightness or
thought of evil in relation to her.
Caroline Archer was the daughter of the
widow of a highly respectable merchant, who
died during the cholera season. After his
death he was found to be insolvent, and from
affluence and comfort, Mrs. Archer became
poor and dependent on her own exertions.
Possessing native energy of character and
inspired to exertion by the necessity of
providing
for four children, the eldest of whom,
our heroine Caroline, was but nine years of
age, she collected a remnant of furniture,
and tenanted a small but neat house in an
obscure street in the rear of Arch street.
Here she eked out a little pittance which
she had saved from the sale of her jewelry,
by taking in sewing from mantua-makers and
milliners, and by needle and worsted-work,
which she disposed of when completed at
the usual depositories for such articles. Thus
by great care, prudence and industry, she
was enabled to clothe and educate Caroline
and the three boys, and even to save up four
hundred dollars, which she placed at interest
in the Saving's Bank. Caroline at length
reached her fifteenth year, and at that age
gave promise of the loveliness that we have
described her as possessing. Her mother
now looked forward to the time when she
should become a governess, for for that
station
had she been educating her, and
between
hope and fear was now about to draw
upon the little means she had husbanded for
this very purpose, and place her under a
music and French master. It was at this
period that the pecuniary tornado burst upon
the land; and the very morning she would
have gone to the bank, in which she had
deposited
her little earnings, she learned that
the institution had become bankrupt and
worthless. She had lost her all! Without
a murmur, for she was a Christian, and true
Christianity had taught her to school her
heart to the teachings of adversity, she
banished
her ambitious hopes for her child for
ever from her breast, and placed her, the
very day on which she had learned her
adversity,
as an apprentice to a miliner and
mantua-maker in Walnut street.
At the period of our story Caroline had
been nearly two years an apprentice, during
which time sorrow and maternal anxiety had
undermined her mother's health so far that
she was unable to contribute longer to the
support of her family, the care of which
now devolved on this noble girl. All day
she laboured at her needle in the little back
parlor of the shop. Her task done, she
hastened
home through the twilight to attend to
the domestic duties of her little family.
After
her brothers were a-bed, she would sit by
the wasting invalid and toil till midnight over
her sewing to earn an additional sum to
purchase
for her those little comforts so
grateful
to the sick. Her brothers, thanks to the
munificent school system of the city, were
taught daily at the public school without
expense,
and, save the homely provision for
their table, they were happy and well enough
off. Caroline alone bore all the burden of
toil and anxiety. Yet she shrunk not from
it, but unweariedly, with a cheerful temper
and a light heart, gave herself a willing
sacrifice
to her filial affection. Woman in
adversity rise into the angel.
CHAPTER II.
MRS. Emily Wharton was the most
charming
bride that had been led to the altar, in
Philadelphia, during the winter of 1838. Her
husband, Percy Wharton, was a young
gentleman
of fortune, just from his travels in
Europe, where he had first seen his future
bride. They were a noble pair, and nature
as well as fortune had made them worthy of
each other. Percy was generous,
high-spirited,
and the soul of honorable feeling.
Travel
had not spoiled, but improved him. It had
elevated his character, and given him a
healthy
knowledge not only of mankind but of
himself. He was amiable to a fault, and not
less distinguished for the quiet, gentlemanly
tone of his manners, than for his learning
and good sense. Emilyhow shall I
describe
her? Let the reader imagine the
loveliest
young bride he or she had ever beheld,
and they will form some notion of the
exquisite
grace and beauty of Mrs. Emily
Wharton.
But, then, this lovely young bride
must have hair, black as the raven's wing,
and eyes, dark as midnight, with long
shadowy
lashes, just subduing, not veiling their
brilliancy. She should have a complexion
something between a Spanish girl's and a
blonde
, but more favoring the Spanish, with
dark, arched brows, contrasting, but,
harmonizing,
with a pleasing forehead not so white
as Parian marble, but softer and far more
beautiful. She should have an exquisite
profile
not
Greciannot Italianbut
American
that lovely, delicate outline of the face so
peculiar to beautiful American females, which
possesses all the regular chisseling of the
Grecian
beau ideal
without its hardness. Her
nose, too, should be the least bit in the world
retrousse
, and with the most charming mouth
she should have a sweet, sparkling smile,
which should display a set of the most
brilliant
teeth that ever gave richness to the smile
of beauty. Such was the face of Emily
Wharton. Her figure was moulded like that
of a youthful goddess, superb and Juno-like.
She dressed with perfect taste, which,
altogether
,
united with her beautiful face, won
for her the praise of being the finest and
most lovely shaped woman in Philadelphia.
She was clever (in the English sense)
without
being a blue, and her conversation was
full of wit and vivacity. She had a good
share of plain common sense, and but very
little vanity. If she was vain of anything it
was of her handsome husband, to whom she
had been now four months married, andof
her beautiful teeth.
CHAPTER III.
It
was a bright and cheerful May morning,
after a refreshing night shower. Caroline
Archer, with two or three other apprentices
were seated at work upon a superb green
riding
dress, which, apparently, was nearly
finished
.
The morning seemed too lovely to
remain
within. Caroline glanced out of the
back window into the little parterre, adorned
with a few flower pots of geraniums and
monthly roses, and sighed. The little canary
bird in the cage hung up by the outside of
the door, sung with most noisy hilarity as the
slanting sun-beams, that poured into the yard
between the tall, surrounding roofs, shone
warm upon his perch, while a mocking bird,
in the neighboring yard of a French
peruquier
poured forth a flood of ravishing songs, as if
trying to rival the yellow minstrel by the
richness and wonderful variety of his strains.
Glimpses from the open door were caught of
passengers in the streetsgliding past, all
gay, cheerful, and seemingly happy.
Caroline
sighed again, and bending her face over
her work, pursued her toil. She sighed not
to mingle in the gay throng---nor for liberty
though confinement to one so young and
naturally light hearted, and with a soul to
enjoy
the happiness of life was irksome and
trying. She sighed to think of her mother's
lonely and desolate condition, at such a
joyous
hour. `How she would enjoy this bright
sunshine! If I could only be at home for
half an hour to lead her forth on a short
walk!' were her thoughts. She had also
recently
had a new cause for anxiety. Her
mother's
illness had not only exhausted all her
own little wages, but had left her with no
means to meet their quarterly rent of twenty
dollars, which was due that evening at nine
o'clock. She knew not how to obtain it----
knew not what to do. She was, therefore,
sad and thoughtful, and full of anticipation of
evil to those she loved. Unless the rent was
promptly met, she knew that their cruel
landlady
(for a coarse, vulgar woman, who kept
an inn at the corner of their street, was the
owner of their tenement,) would, as she had
threatened, seize upon their little furniture,
and turn them into the street.
While she was indulging these happy
thoughts, a young gentleman entered the
shop in front; for Mrs. Carvil, the milliner,
like many others in her line, kept a dry goods
store, in addition to her millinery department.
`There's a customer. I cannot go into the
shop, for this braid must be set on, and if
Mrs. Wharton don't get her dress by eleven
o'clock, I shall lose one of my best
customers
,'
said Mrs. Carvil, a little lady, with a
very little foot, a very little waist, a very
little
beauty, a very little sense, a very little
pug nose, and a very great deal of temper.
`Caroline, he is a young fellow
you
go and
wait on him! And mind you,
dare
go
behind
the counter with that serious, sickly
look! I can see you through the glass door,
and if you dont wear your finest shop-smile
for him, look outthat's all
look out!
I am
not agoing to have my customers driven away
by cross looks in my girlswhen a smile,
that costs nothing, will make many a young
fellow leave twenty dollars behind him. I
have a certain smile, girls,' she continued,
as Caroline rose to obey her, `that has brought
me in more than one fifty dollar bill in my
time;' and Mrs. Carvil screwed her withered
visage into an extraordinary muscular
contortion
that many a man would willingly give
fifty dollars to escape a second infliction of.
Caroline was despatched by Mrs. Carvil to
wait on the young gentleman because she
was the loveliest of her flock, and experience
had shown the milliner the wisdom of this
species of policy. It was only when `fine
gentlemen' were the customers, Caroline was
sent into the shop; on all other occasions
Mrs. Carvil herself, or one of the other girls
officiated.
Caroline entered the shop with a heavy
heart, and as she was passing round the
counter, seeing that the customer was a
fashionable
and remarkably handsome young
man, she approached the place where he
stood with a rising color end a step of
timidity
.
`Have you gloves?' he asked, lifting his
fine eyes to her face.
There was a golden glow of surprise and
an involuntary change to the deepest
respect
in the concluding tones of his voice,
as his glance rested on her face, that bore
testimony
to her charms. She could not but be
sensible of the cause of his emotion, and the
mantling blush of maidenly embarrassment
heightened her loveliness.
With an agitated hand she took down the
packages of gloves, without lifting her eyes
to the admiring gaze which she knew was
ardently, yet respectfully, stealing glances
of her beauty, laid them before him. He at
length selected several pairs of gloves, and,
taking out an elegant green wallet with a
mimature on the inside, paid for them in
silence
,
and she delivered them to him in the
same eloquent silence. Caroline was all the
while strangely embarrassed, and so
evidently
was the young gentleman; and a timid
glance she had ventured to steal of his face
as he was measuring a pair of gloves upon
his white and symmetrical hand, awakened
in her bosom an interest in him such as she
had never before experienced towards any of
the numerous young gentlemen she had seen.
She could not define it, but it will be plain
to the female reader that it was the first
tender
germ of
love
. When he departed from
the shop, which he did with a bow of the
most respectful admiration, it was with a
heightened cheek, a throbbing heart, and
emotions of mingled pain and pleasure that
Caroline returned to the sewing room.
`How much did he buy?' asked Mrs.
Carvil
,
as Caroline resumed her needle, and bent
her head low over her work to conceal,
beneath
a cloud of curls, the confusion that she
felt was telling tales upon her.
The maiden's reply was low and
inaudible
,
as her face was still concealed, while her
needle seemed to have forgot its wonted
skill, and made awkward work upon the
edges of the elegant riding habit.
`
Miss
Archer
if
you
please
,' said Mrs.
Carvil, in the emphatic tone and accent of
offended dignity, bridling up her person, and
looking angrily at her apprentice.
`Six pairs, ma'am,' said Caroline more
distinctly
,
without raising her head.
`I am glad you have found your tongue,
Miss. What are you doing, trollop? Look
at them stitches. As I am a living woman, if
the girl is not working a button-hole stitch
on the hem. If you don't know what you're
about, Caroline Archer, you had best put on
your bonnet and shawl. A hint's enough to
some folks.'
Caroline's cheek now became as pale as it
was hitherto roseate; and really alarmed at
the angry language of her mistress, she
instantly
picked out the unfortunate
button-hole
stitch, and nimbly plying her needle for
the next half hour, when the riding dress was
completed, amply atoned for her fault.
CHAPTER IV.
A little
before one o'clock, on the same
day in which the scenes at the miliner's took
place, a gallant cavalcade, consisting of half
a dozen ladies and gentlemen, started from
the door of one of the princely mansions in
Girard Place, and, full of gaiety and spirits,
turned towards Broad street. Here they gave
the rein to their spirited horses, aud at a rapid
pace rode along this magnificent avenue,
which, but for the railroad that disfigures it,
would be without a parallel in the cities of the
Union. A few minutes swift riding brought
them into the suburbs, and after winding
through many shady lanes, and traversing
pleasant roads, adorned with citizens' villas,
they issued upon a spacious thoroughfare,
crowded with carriages, pedestrians, and
horsemen, and, soon after, descending a hill,
from which was a most delightful rural
prospect
of woodland, lawn, and river, they drew
rein at the gate of the Laurel Hill Cemetery.
By the courtesy of the very gentlemanly
originator
and director of this lovely spot, Mr.
Smith, the ladies were permitted, without the
trouble of dismounting, to ride through the
gravelled avenue of this exquisite place.
`Pray, Mr. Smith,' asked one of the ladies,
distinguished less by a superb green
riding-habit
,
that swept the ground with its flowing
folds, than by the elegance of her figure, the
dazzling beauty of her face, the perfection of
her seat in the saddle, and the admirable
maniege
of her steed; `pray, Mr. Smith, do
tell me if that is one of Thom's statues of
Souter Jonny you have in that niche?'
`Ride nearer, Mrs. Wharton, where you
can look over the iron fence, and you will
recognise
in it a
graver
friend of yours than
Souter Jonny,' said the director smiling.
`
It is
Old Mortality, in very truth, Percy
---Frank, did you ever see any thing so
perfect
.
I wish Walter Scott were of our party
and could see it. How it would delight the
good old gentleman.'
`Which of them, Scott or Mortality, sis?'
asked the young man whom she had called
Frank, the very same young gentleman that
had made Caroline Archer work a button-hole
stitch on `a hem.' A pair of fawn colored
gloves he had purchased were upon his
hands.
`Are you not ashamed, Frank, to destroy
Emmy's sentiment?' asked Percy Warton,
smiling.
`Frank has no more sentiment than Sultan
here!' she said, patting her horse upon the
arches mane. `See how intelligently he
looks, as if he were alive to the beauties of
the sculpture and had read Waverly. Out
upon you, brother Frank.'
`Believe me sis, he is trying to spell out
that tin sign hung on the statue, like a
porter's
label.'
`Silence, brother! this is no place for light
conversation. Indeed, I think it will be wrong
to ride through the cemetery.'
`Trains of funeral carriages traverse it
daily,' Mrs. Wharton,' said the proprieter, `and
I always drive in in my barouche.'
`You had best ride in, Emily,' said Percy,
`as we have planned a long ride before we
return to the city, and there will be detention
in re-mounting.'
Slowly moving along the ascending and
winding avenues, the whole party,
accompanied
by the attentive director, went through
the whole cemetery, lingering here and there
before a monument, and selecting lovely spots
where they thought they would love to lie
when life's cares were over.
`Elizabeth!' repeated Mrs. Wharton,
pausing
before a simple block of white marble
erected above a greon grave. `How
touching
!
Not another word on the tomb! How
affectingly touching! Here is another
`My daughter, aged seventeen years!'
What a tale these few eloquent words tell.'
Thus they wandered through the rural
grounds of the cemetery, yet pausing a
moment
on the highest part, where all its ways
met, to contemplate a prospect that has no
equal. The Schuylkill, stretched away to the
right and left, presenting on either hand the
most perfect scenery, so that it was difficult
to decide which were the lovelier, the
northern
or southern view. Its banks were
adorned
by groves of oak and elm, that from
sloping
green hills, descended till they hung over
the water, which was black with their
shadows
.
Numerous villas, with laws of bright
green spread before them, studded here and
there with a copse or a group of venerable
trees, were half hid, half seen through the
torests on either shore; while the quiet and
repose of the whole was relieved and
enlivened
by gaily painted canal barges, gliding
beneath
the banks and filling the air with the
wild melody of their bugles.
`How lovely!' was the exclamation of all,
after they had surveyed the beauty of the
prospect.
`Do you remember Mount Auburn?' asked
Percy of Emily.
`Yes, but it is less lovely than this. Here,
methinks, I would willingly repose after death.
I never thought so of Mount Auburn. There
is a gloom and awful solemnity about its
deep glens and dark dells, fringed with pine
and cypress, that made me shudder as I
entered
them. What lovelier place could
one desire, dear Percy, than beneath yonder
graceful willow---where the sun-beam is
broken
into diamonds ere it falls on the sward,
and where the singing birds light and pour
forth their happy song.'
`A literary friend of mine who was here
yesterday,' said Mr. Smith, `spoke of the
same spot, and was so struck with its retired
beauty, that he was half inclined to remove
two lovely children buried at the South and
place them here.'
`It is, indeed, a lovely spot. If it were
mine, I would have a monument erected there
with simply `Percy' and `Emily' upon it,'
said Mrs. Wharton, with tenderness.
`Nay, dear Emmathis is idle!' said
Percy
,
with a look of distress. `We will return
to the gate, Frank, and mount our horses.
Good morning, Mr. Smith, and receive our
thanks for your kindness and courtesy.
Laurel
Hill is a lovely placebut all its
loveliness
will not disguise the fearful use to which
it is devoted.
Allons, Emma
.'
As he spoke, he unintentionally waved his
riding whip with a quick movement near the
head of her fiery horse, which started back
and reared with her so high, that, fearing she
would lose her seat and fall backward, she
struck him a smart blow with her whip. The
animal, enraged at this, bounded forward
along the avenue on a run, and with the bit
in his teeth, rapidly followed the windings of
the walk, perilling her life at every turn in
the path, and swiftly descended the
excavated
road leading to the gate. Mrs. Wharton
did not lose her presence of mind, and
maintained
her seat like a good horsewoman; but
all her strength and management was not
sufficient to give her command of the curb.
The gentlemen had followed, like the wind,
to intercept the horse ere he reached the gate,
and were turning the angle on the mound
that brought them in sight of it, when they
saw the horse, who found the gate closed
against him, turn short round to retrace his
steps, and throw her with the saddle, the
girth of which broke, with violence against a
column of the arch. In a moment Percy
and her brother were at her side, and
supporting
her in their arms. She was bleeding
profusely from the mouth, but to the earnest
inquiries of both she replied she was not
hurt, as the saddle had broken the force of
her fall.
`I have only cut my lip, I believe,' she
said with a smile, trying to re-assure her
alarmed husband.
She put her hand to her mouth as she spoke,
and with a shriek, such as only a beautiful
woman with a fine set of teeth could give at
such a moment, almost fainted in Percy's
arms.
`My dear Emmayou are dying!' he ex
claimed in alarm. `Alas, my beautiful wife.'
`Alas, my beautiful teeth!'
`Teeth!'
`I have lost my teeth,' she said with
despair
.
`Nothing more. Thank heaven! I thought
you were seriously hurt.'
`My teeth, Percy! my beautiful teeth!'
`Here is onehere is anotherby the
rood! here are four of them, sister Emma!'
cried Frank, gathering up from the gravel,
as he spoke, four of those brilliant teeth
which had made Mrs. Wharton's smile so
fascinating, and of which, next to Percy, she
was so, innocently, vain. `Have you lost
any more!'
`Any more!' repeated Mrs. Wharton, in
despair.
`Indeed, Emily dearest, have you suffered
no other injury than the loss of your teeth.'
`
No other
Percy.'
`I am thankful for the preservation of your
life.'
`You will love me no longer, Percy. I
shall be a fright! I would rather have been'
`
Killed outright
, you were going to add, I
dare say, sis,' said Frank, kissing her
tenderly
;
`for a pretty woman to lose her life is, I
believe, a less sacrifice than to lose her
beauty
.
But never despair. You have got
beauty
enough left to make a hundred foolish
fellows, like Percy here, fall in love with
you.'
`What
shall
I do! Mercy! my voice sounds
like grandma's!'
`You have the advantage, then,' said
Frank, `of knowing how you will speak
when you get to be a grandma?'
`Frank, you have no pity! What shall I
do, Percy?'
`Go to Dr. 's, the dentist.'
CHAPTER V.
The
same afternoon, Dr.  was in his
handsomely furnished reception room,
leaning
back in his arm chair, with a Regalia
cigar in his lips, which he was idly indulging,
for he had just dined. With the last Lady's
Book in his fingers, he was, at the same time,
listlessly looking at the print of fashions, and
wondering (for he was a bachelor) how many
enamelled teeth he must set in a year to keep
a wife in fashionable dresses, if he should
run the risk of taking one, when a carriage
suddenly drew up at his door, steps were let
down, and the next instant his bell was rung
with an emphasis that made him start. He
looked through his blinds.
`Ladies! and at this hour! The room is
filled with tobacco smoke. 'Tis Percy
Wharton
and his beautiful wife, (I would give an
eagle a piece for her teeth) aad her brother,
Mr. Francis Astley, who I know makes a
practice of smoking in her drawing-room.
She is therefore used to it. I will make no
apologies.'
The party entered the dentist's room, and
were received by him with professional
courtesy. Mrs. Wharton was pale, and a
cambric ksrchief covered her beautifulalas!
no longer beautifulmouth!
`You smoke cigars, Doctor,' said young
Astley. `I will trouble you.'
`With the greatest pleasure in the world,
sir,' answered the Doctor, giving him his
cigar case; `but I should apologize to Mrs.
Wharton for smoking in my receiving-room;
but not expecting ladies at this late hour'
`I have come Dr.  to ask you if you
can restore my teeth,' said Mrs. Wharton,
interrupting him, and removing her kerchief
from her mouth.
`Your teeth, madam!'
`I have lost four by a fall from my horse.'
`Those beautiful teeth! permit me to look,
madam.'
The Doctor held up both hands in unfeign
ed astonishment and commiseration, for, like
a professional architect gazing with pain upon
a scene of architectural ruins, the restoration
of which would be his gain, he contemplated
the devastation of the even rows of snowy
teeth he had before admired, with sorrow,
notwithstanding his imagination filled up the
gap with guineas
`Indeed, madam, it is the world's pity!
he said, shaking his head.
`Can you do nothing for me?' she asked,
watching his countenance with sinking heart.
`Nature, madam, is the best dentist. I
can never match the pearly transparency of
the remaining teeth. Two upper and two
lower, and directly in front! Oh, what a
misfortune. Two incisorstwo cuspids
What a sad misfortune!'
`You
must
remedy it, Doctor.'
`Never saw so fine a set of teeth in my
life! Would have given a sovereign a
piece for them!' soliloquized the dentist.
`Have you the teeth, madam?'
`Here they are Doctor,' said Astley,
taking
them from his silk purse.
`Beautiful! Incomparable!' exclaimed the
dentist, looking at them with the eye of a
connoissieur.
`Can you replace them, Doctor?' she
asked
,
faintly.
`Worth a guinea each. What translucent
enamel! a manufacture of such would make
my fortune!'
`
Doctor!
' exclaimed Mrs. Wharton, with
petulant impatience, seeing he paid no
attention
to her.
`I beg pardon madam.'
`Can you replace my teeth?'
`No, madam.'
`Can you match them?'
`I will give you five guineas a-piece to do
it,' said Percy Wharton.
`There is but one way,' said the dentist,
with hesitation.
`Name itit shall be done at my
sacrifice
.'
`By extracting teeth from another's jaw
and placing them with the nerve still warm
in the cavities of your own.'
`Oh, horrid!' exclaimed Emily Wharton,
with a shudder.
`Will any human being submit to such a
sacrifice?' asked Francis Astley, with
surprise
.
`If paid for it. I have thrice performed
this operation since I have been in practice.'
`Who were the victims?' asked Astley,
with surprise.
`Those who have the most beautiful teeth
in the world?' answered the dentist, with a
smile.
`You don't mean'
`I do mean your negresses.'
`Hear this Emma?' said Frank, with a
mischievous smile.
`The idea is absolutely disgusting!'
answered
Percy, with a corresponding
contortion
of the lips.
`I had rather go without teeth,' said Mrs.
Wharton.
`You will have to put up with the ordering
false teeth, Emma,' observed her husband.
`Can you match my own?'
`With difficulty, they are so brilliant.'
`Try, Doctor,' said Percy, `and if you
succeed
you shall be well paid.'
`If Mrs Wharton will do me the honor to
call to-morrow, at twelve, I will then have a
set that I think will suit her so far as false
teeth will compensate for natural ones
especially
such as she has lost.'
`Doctor, don't speak of them, I beg of you.
I will call to-morrow,' said Mrs. Wharton,
preparing to go.
`You will not think, then, of the other
proposition
I suggested'
`No, sir,' replied Percy Wharton, with
indignation
.
The door closedthe carriage rolled away
and the dentist was left alone.
`How prejudiced are some people!' he
ejaculated, as the sounds of the wheels died
away. `There is many a mulattress with
the finest teeth imaginablescarcely as
beautiful as these, indeedthat would lose
them for a guinea each. 'Tis rather
shocking
to a young husband's taste, to have his
wife's mouth filled wiih an African girl's
teeth, to be sure! But there is no help for it
if he would have her mouth restored!'
Thus soliloquized Dr. ; and falling
asleep in his arm chair, with the four teeth
he had been admiring held in the open palm
of his hand, he dreamed that a sudden cloud
came up, and that amid thunder and
lightning
a storm of hail descended, breaking in
every pane of his glass, and covering his
floors with glittering hail-stones, which, as
they fell, he saw to his surprise, instead of
being ice, were the most beautiful teeth
incisors, cuspids, bicuspids
, and
molars
which for whiteness, symmetry, transparency
and polish, far surpassed any thing of the kind
he had ever seen,
`Now will I supply Mrs. Wharton's loss
and rival nature!' he exclaimed, as a clap
of thunder shook his apartments and
awakened
him to the consciousness that a smart
shower was pattering against his windows.
`My teeth are all rain-water! Poor Mrs.
Wharton will have to wait for these big drops
of rain to crystalize. There is my bell. I
thought I heard it when I was asleep.
Where is that confounded boy Pete, that is
ever out of the way when he is wanted!'
Thus speaking, the Doctor rose from his
arm-chair and opened his door to a servant
in livery, with a dripping umbrella in his
hand, who leaving a note with him, hastily
departed. It read thus:
`If Doctor  knows of a young
healthy
white person, with a fine set of teeth that
will match hers, and who for a sufficient
remuneration
is willing to sacrifice them and
substitute a set of false ones for them, Mrs.
Wharton will consent to the arrangement,
though greatly against her proper feeling.
Mrs. W. will pay the person not only five
guineas each, but provide, at her own
expense
,
a set of your best false teeth for her.
Your own remuneration for effecting this
will be whatever you fix it at. Mrs. W.
will call at 12, as requested.
`No.  Girard Place. 5 o'clock. P.M.
`This Mrs. Wharton is a sensible woman.
If her note is not written without her
husband's
knowledge. I have no skill in
detecting
mystery in female handwriting. A young
healthy person, with a fine set of teeth.
Hum! It were a difficult matter to find a
counterpart to these four teeth in the incisors
or cuspids of any `young healthy person' of
my acquaintance. I know every good set of
teeth in the city. Not one like hers, though,
and of that peculiar transparent enamel! It's
a bad job. I will advertise!'
Thus determining, the dentist sat down to
his escrutoire and wrote this advertisement
for the morning paper:
`A young woman, from sixteen to eighteen
years of age, who has a fine set of teeth, and
who is willing for a valuable consideration to
part with four of the front ones, will please
call at the office of Dr. , dentist, No.
Row, to-day, between 12 and 1
o'clock.'
`I think that will do. 'Tis an odd
advertisement
,
but it's nobody's business! It shall
go in. There's doubtless many a one of the
pretty shop girls I have seen smiling and
displaying
teeth that would make a dentist's
fortune, would be glad, for a hundred silver
dollars, to lose every tooth they have in their
heads. Here Pete, you scoundrel, you!
You come in now that the rain drives you in
doors! Take this advertisement to the
Daily Chronicle office, and tell the editor it
most be inserted in to-morrow's morning's
paper. Do you hear, Pete?'
`Yeth, thir,' lisped the little negro in reply.
`Then scamper, and if you are not back
in twenty minutes I'll draw every tooth out
of your head.'
`Yeth, thir,' answered the urchin,
disappearing
through the door; while the easy
tempered dentist, looking after him with a
smile, gave himself up to conjectures upon
the probable issue of his advertisement.
CHAPTER VI.
The
same evening, a few minutes before
nine o'clock, in a small apartment in one of
the humblest dwellings of the city alleys,
was assembled the small family that occupied
it. It consisted of a pale middle-aged
woman
with the traces of beauty and
refinement
upon her sickly features, lying upon a
neat but plain bed that stood on one side of
the room, and a lovely girl in youthful
bloom, save that the lily of confinement and
care had supplanted the joyous rose that
should have tinted her cheek, who sat by the
bed-side and read to her from the Bible,
while the sewing, she had temporarily put
down, lay upon her lap. In a trundle bed
that was partly rolled beneath the larger,
slept two handsome little boys that were the
very images of their sister; while seated by
the candle which gave light to her, was their
elder brother, a little lame lad, but very
intellectual
looking, as almost all lame boys
are. He had Captain Riley's travels in his
hand, and was reading his adventures with
absorbing interest, Caroline continued to read
aloud:
`Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them
that fear him, upon them that hope in his
mercy.
`To deliver their soul from death, and to
keep them alive in famine.
`Our soul waiteth for the Lord, he
is
our
health and our shield.
`Our hearts shall rejoice in him: because
we have trusted in his holy name.'
`How beautiful this language, dear mother.'
`It is precious, indeed, my child. Every
word touches my heart, and in every
sentence
I see the faithful promise of the widow's
God.'
At this moment an abrupt knock was heard
at the door, and the city clocks began to toll
nine.
`It is the landlady,' exclaimed Caroline, as
her heart flew into her mouth.
`Fear not, my daughter, she is in God's
hands as well as we.'
Caroline opened the door, and a large,
masculine-looking
woman, with a red fleshy face,
and a hard expression to her little gray eyes,
appeared at it.
`Well, Miss, I have come for my rent. I
have given your mother since yesterday
twelve o'clock, to raise it. I suppose it's
ready for me.' And with these words she
entered the room and seated herself in a
chair by the door with the insolent and
over-bearing
air of a mistress in her own house.
`Indeed, Mrs. Cringle, I have not yet heard
from my brother in Louisville, to whom I
wrote, and he is my only dependence,' said
Mrs. Archer from the bed. `I shall soon
hearhave the kindness to indulge me a
few days.'
`You'll get no letters, I tell ye, now, Mrs.
Archer; if you do there'll be no more money
in't than'll hide my thumb-nail. These
brothers
are as fond of keeping their money as
other folk. NoI can't wait. My rent I
must have, and my rent I will have. So pay
it over, or tramp!'
`Indeed, Mrs. Cringle'
`Don't Mrs. Cringle me with your indeeds.
If you han't no money, what are you doin'
with that gilt portrait up there? The
pawn-broker
'll advance you a five on't.'
`It's my husband's.'
`So much the better to belong to a dead
person. I sold all my man's dud'swatch,
black profile, and all. When one husband's
gone make a clean sweep for a new one
that's my maxim. Here's young Miss here
with a new bright gown on!'
`It's only clean and smoothly ironed, Mrs.
Cringle. It is a cheap calico, and I have
worn it several months,' said Caroline with
gentleness.
`Why don't
you
help your mother? you
work at the milliners's and must earn
something
.'
`I do earn a little, ma'amfrom two to
three '
levies
a day, but there are five mouths
to feedfive to clothebesides medicine for
mother.'
`Yes, and not a dollar for your rent. This
won't do for meI must have tenants that'll
pay. So down with twenty-five dollars or
march. Not a thing do you carry off with
you. Every article here would'nt two-thirds
pay me. So down with it.'
`I implore you to be merciful,' cried Mrs.
Archer, raising herself in the beddo not
visit your vengeance upon my children.'
`What right have you to take a house
when you were not able to pay the rent. It's
downright swindlin' o' honest folks.'
`We must have a shelter somewhereand
we hoped to be able to pay for itbut I have
been sick, and misfortunes have come upon
us in various ways.'
`This is the old song. It won't come over
me
. I must have my rent.'
`We cannot pay it to-night, Mrs. Cringle,'
said Caroline, imploringly`if you have any
human feeling let my mother remain in your
house until to-morrow afternoon, and in the
meanwhile I will see what I can to do to
raise the amount due you. Surely charity
and generosity have not fled the human
breast. There must be some way of relief.'
`There
is
a way you can get the money
very easily, my pretty Miss,' said the vile
hag, with a look and glance, that the purity
of Caroline's nature could not understand.
`Oh, howtell me how?' she asked
eagerly
.
`Do you ask me
how
, with that pretty face
of yours, and nice young figure! I could
show you many a fine young gentleman who
would make your fortune for ye, and in one
hour from now place ten times my debt in
your hands.'
`Fiend! I understand you now! Oh, God!
that I should come to this!'
For a moment Caroline struggled to
suppress
her tears, but in vain. Her pure,
insulted
spirit was crushed, and she burst into
a shower of bitter tears. She wept as if her
heart would break. Even the devilish
landlady
was at length moved.
`Well, childI've seen greater matters
than that I hinted at make a less to do! If
you won't, why then you won't. I've known
many a young girl sitivated like you would
be glad of the offer I made you. Well, if
you can pay me a part to-night, five dollars or
soI'll wait 'till to-morrow sun-down for the
balancean' if you can't pay then, vy you
must
tramp, and no more said!'
`I have four dollars and three quartersif
that will satisfy you, take it,' said Caroline,
going to her reticule. `It is the last I have
saved from my wages for my sick mother.
Take it up,' she said, laying it upon the
table
,
and shrinking back from her
instinctively
for
her delicacy had received too severe
a shock for her to bear the sight or touch of
the iniquitous creature who had been the
cause of it.
`Well, this 'll do for to-night. I'll call
to-morrow
sun-down, and hopes you 'll have
the balance. If as how you do, vy I'll be
willin' to try ye here another quarter, if ye
choose to stay.'
Thus speaking, this iniquitous wretch, who
is the counterpart of too many landladies and
landlords of a certain class, left the house.
She had scarcely closed the door, when with
an agonizing shriek of poignant suffering,
Caroline threw herself upon her mother's bed,
and wept till gentle sleep sealed her sunses
in oblivion.
CHAPTER VII.
The
next morning Caroline put on her hat
and shawl and went mechanically to her daily
tasks at Mrs. Carvil's. On the way she was
sadly thinking what she should do to relieve
her mother, and was busily devising some
way to obtain the money for her. The idea
occurred to her of throwing herself upon the
generosity of the lady of some wealthy
citizen
;
but even her little knowledge of human
nature had taught her that some ladies are
apt to look with suspicion upon unfortunate
girls, and are apt to have less charity for
them than they should have; while she
shrunk from applying to a gentleman, lest
her motives might be misinterpreted, and her
delicacy hurt by dreaded offers of conditional
assistance, that might wound her maidenly
sensibility far more than the landlady's words
had done. What to do she knew not, and
with a thousand schemes in her mind she
had come to no determination when she found
herself in Walnut street, and within a few
doors of Mrs. Carvil's.
`Oh, what, what shall I do! If I go in she
will not let me go for the rest of the day, and
something must be effected before I return
home. Oh, that I could find a purse with
twenty-one dollars in itfor there seems no
other way of relief.'
She had scarcely spoken when she beheld
lying upon the side-walk, a few steps before
her, a small green pocket-book. She
bounded
forward and caught it up with a cry
between
hope and doubt. A glance showed
her it was full of bank notes. The next
moment she was in Mrs. Carvill's little par
lour, and as she was the earliest there of the
apprentices, she was alone. With a
trembling
hand she took the pocket-book from her
bosom and furtively unclasped it. Within
was a miniature, and she recognized it as the
same the purchaser of the gloves had taken
out to pay her for them. She trembled still
more, and partly unfolding the notes, she
saw the figures 50, XX, X, 5, upon them.
She offered up a short ejaculation of
gratitude
,
while visions of the happiness she
could bring to her mother that evening filled
her heart with joy. But what means this
sudden paleness of the cheekthis sinking
of the spiritsthis dropping of the whole
form but now so animate with hope and joy?
What means this desponding air and aspect
of despair mingled with resignation! Why
has she slowly reclasped the book, and why
dejectedly return it to her bosom! The
reflection
has suddenly flashed upon her mind
that the treasure is not hersthat it belongs
to anotherthat he has no right to make
use of it without the owner's permission
that it is a sacred thing.
`Nono' she said, with virtuous
resolution
that gave brightness to her eye and a
heightened flush to her cheek, `it is not
mine!
I will let the storm burst upon our
devoted
roof ere I seek to avert it by guilt. No
I will discover and restore it to the owner
and in the meanwhile
forget
that I have
found it!'
Having made this noble resolution, she
opened the pocket book and counted the
amount
it contained, which was three hundred
and seventy-five dollars in the United States
Bank notes, and restored them to their place
in it. On the edge of the pocket book she
then saw written, Francis Astley, No.
Girard Place.
`No, it is not mine! Heaven has kept me
from using it. If I'd taken a portion of it, and
afterwards been unable to make it up, my fair
name and honor would have been in his
power. Protector of the innocent I thank
thee for delivering me from this great
temptation
.'
With the determination of sending her
eldest
brother with to Girard Place, when she
should return me at noon, she sat herself
down to work with a heart relieved (she knew
not why) from a great load, and with that
consciousness of rectitude which ever carries
with it its own reward. She felt, too, less
anxiety than she had hitherto done about the
result of the day's events, and seemed buoyed
up with the assurance that all would yet be
well with herself and all dear to her.
About ten o'clock in the forenoon the
newsbop
threw into the door the morning paper,
which one of the young girls caught up and
began to read aloud to Mrs. Carvil, while
she was basting a dress for the
apprentice
to begin upon. After the items of
morning
news had been ended and
characteristically
commented upon by Mrs. Carvil, who
took especial interest in the police reports,
she said,
`Now look, Jane, for the new
advertisements
.
I wonder if Madame Gaubert comes
out with any thing new. These French
women
are taking the bread out of us honest
folks mouths.'
`Here's an advertisement, Mrs. Carvil,'
cried Jane, who had, meanwhile, been
running
her eye over the morning advertising
column, `here's an advertisement that
is
a curious one! I wonder if it is serious!'
`Read it girl,' said Mrs. Carvil, sharply,
`and we then can hest tell!
Here the apprentice read aloud Dr. 's
advertisement.
`It's all a hoax!' said a pretty black-eyed
chery lip'd girl, at work on the same seam
with Caroline.
`How do you know,
pert
, that it's a hoax!'
tartly questioned her mistress. `I once had
a dentista proper handsome man he was
toooffer me a five dollar bill a piece for
two of my front teethhe said they were so
white and shapely, he wanted 'em as models.
See girls they are sound and white yet!'
Here Mrs Carvil grinned a ghastly smile
around upon her apprentices, for the
purpose
of displaying the two ill-shapen rows of
yellow teeth, with an intermixture of glaring
ghastly white one, for which, plainly, she was
indebted to the skill of some proper
handsome
dentist.
`Do you think it earnest then, marm?'
asked the reader of the paper.
`To be sure I do!'
`Then why don't you go, Mrs. Carvil,'
said the black eyed apprentice, gravely`I
dare say the dentist would be glad to get
such beautiful teeth as yours!'
`Mrs. Carvil eyed her sharply, to see if she
was quizzing her, for, truth he told, she had
little faith in her own assertions of the beauty
of her old teeth; but seeing her seriously
continue her sewing, she said, complacently,
`I would, but can't bear the pain of the
destraction
of so many teeth.'
`Caroline, suppose
you
go,' said the black
eyed maiden, with a laugh; `you certainly
have the prettiest teeth I ever saw! If my
teeth were even,' she said, smiling and
displaying
as she did so exceedingly white but
somewhat irregular teeth, `I would lose four
of them forfor'
`For how much, now? asked Mrs Carvil.
`For fifty dollars,' she answered, after a
moments thought.
`I think I would for half that,' said Jaue.
`What would you lose four of your teeth
for, Caroline?' asked she with the cherry
lips.
Caroline did not reply. She had taken
with an unsteady grasp the paper from the
hand of her fellow-apprentice, and with an
effort of calmness, through which those who
knew her history could clearly see the
anxious
,
eager earnestness beneath it, read the
advertisement. All at once her face
assumed
its natural expression, and, laying down
the paper, after taking a single look more at
the advertisement as if to fix the address upon
her mind, she replied, with a bright smile to
the question of her fellow.
`I would take for my teeth only what
would purchase my mother's, my three
brothers
,
and my own happiness, give us all a roof
to sleep beneath for this night, and feel no
anxiety for the morrow.'
`You value your teeth very highly, Miss
Archer,' observed Mrs. Carvil, with a toss of
her head`It would take five hundred
dollars
to do all that.'
`Five thousand dollars for the mere money's
sake, madam, would not induce me to part
with my teeth. The happiness and comforts
of which I have spoken I value far above
wealth. The peace and comfort of a family
are not measured by any scale of gold and
silver. If one dollar would save my mother
from sorrow, and I could get it only by
sacrificing
my teeth, I would as cheerfully part
with them as I would for one hundred
thousand
for
the end would be the same
whether
attained for one dollar or a million.'
`I think you are getting on dictionary stilts,
Miss Archer,' said Mrs. Carvil, who could
not with her narrow mind quite comprehend
the drift of her apprentice's argument. `I
'spose you mean to say, if your mother
wanted
money, you'd sell your teeth to get it for
her.'
`Yes, indeed, I would,' answered Caroline,
firmly.
`Then you might go and get work where
you could; I'd have no toothless girls about
me to frighten people away.'
Caroline sighed, returned the sympathizing
pressure of the dark-eyed apprentice's hand,
under the table, and bending ever her work
plied her needle in silence.
CHAPTER VIII.
The
State House clock tolled twelve,
and Dr.  rose from his dentist's bench
where he had been at work several hours.
`They are perfect. I have made so
beautiful
a piece of work of it that the owner
herself
might not disdain to have them replaced,
if no one answers my advertisement.' As he
spoke he held up to his own admiration the
teeth Mrs. Warton had lost, accurately fitted
to gold plates, and ready for replacing if
necessary
,
or to supply the place of those that
should be sacrificed by some hapless victim.
`They are
chef d'uvres!
Perfect! and they
must fit any mouth that has teeth to fit Mrs.
Wharton's. Incomparable!'
Thus eulogizing them, the enthusiastic
dentist
carefully placed them upon his
instrument
case.
`I wonder if anybody will answer my
advertisement
.
'Tis after twelve, and any one
anxious to do it would have been here with
the last stroke of the clock. But I hope no
decent person in this benevolent city is so
sunk in want as to fly to this alternative for
relief. I have fitted the natural teeth so
well to the elastic plate that Mrs. Wharton
will scarcely object to them. She should be
here soon. Ha! There is my bell. Pete,
you vagabond, where are you? In the street
playing marbles with the penny paper boys,
I'll wager my eye teeth! I heard no carriage
stop!'
The dentist opened his door and saw
before
it a graceful young woman, who from
the plain but neat straw cottage, green veil,
and small cheap shawl, as well as from a
certain air of gentility about her, he knew
to be a milliner's apprentice. Her veil was
closely drawn over her face, and her figure
was hid beneath the folds of the shawl, but
he could not fail to discover through all that
her face was youthful and lovely, and that her
figure was light and symmetrical. Her foot
and handfor the Doctor had an eye for
female
beauty, and his eyes sought
unconsciously
those never-erring signs of birth and
well-breeding, were smallthe foot
exquisitely
so.
`Walk in, Miss,' said the dentist, with
native gallantry, for Dr.  was a great
admirer of beauty.
`Thank you, sir! butbut'
`Pray be seated, Misstooth-ache, I
suppose
.
I will extract it in a minute!' said the
dentist, taking his `key' and scientifically
winding his red silk handkerchief about its
polished shaft.
`No, sirbut' and the soft musical
voice trembled.
`No tooth-ache!' repeated the Doctor,
impressed
by the richness of her low tones;
`that I will asseverate; you have not the
tooth-ache! Your voice would not be so
even and musical if you had. An aching
tooth in that fine toned instrument, the human
voice, is like a key out of tune on a piano
it makes discord of the whole.'
`You advertised, sir, I believe,' said
Caroline
,
with a firmer tone.
`Ah! I perceive. Is it possible you have
come hither from reading my advertisement?'
`Yes, sir.'
`Are you willing to lose four of your teeth?'
`Yes, sirifif'
`Paid well for them, you would say.'
`No, sir,' cried Caroline, earnestly; `I
care not for that so much as'here she
hesitated, and then added, abruptly`I am
in great need of a certain sum of money, sir,
and will do it for that.'
`Name the sum!'
`Twenty dollars.'
`Let me see your teeth, if you please,' said
the Doctor, with feelings painfully touched
by the emotion she in vain tried to suppress.
She removed her veil and showed a face
so very lovely, that he started back with an
exclamation of surprise. He then asked in
the most delicate and respectful manner to
examine her mouth. Parting with an ivory
slip the lips of the half-fainting yet resolute
girl, as she sat in his `patients' chair,' he
beheld
the whitest and most symmetrically
arranged
teeth, each one perfeet in itself, he
had ever met withnot even excepting Mrs.
Wharton's
`Are you in earnest in wishing to part
with these fine teeth?' he demanded with
astonishment, after admiring them for a few
moments with delighted surprise.
`Yes, sir,'
`I beg of you do not part with themit
were sacrilege to mar so fair an instument
to destroy the ivory columns of so beautiful
a temple! Are you sincere?'
`Indeed, sir, I am.'
`I fear me either great virtue or great
avarice
hath driven you to this, child!'
`I beg of you, sir, tell me if my teeth are
such as you require!
`They are perfect,' he said, taking those
which he had set upon the gold plate, and
comparing them.
`And will you give me twenty dollars for
the four front ones, sir?' she asked with
trembling
doubt.
`I will. Will you consent to have them
drawn?'
`At once.'
The sound of a carriage driving to the
door was now heard, and the Doctor
desiring
Caroline to retire to his ante-room from
observation, the next moment received Mrs.
Wharton. She was pale but no less lovely.
'You received my note, Doctor?' she
asked
seated.
But I have, as you here
see, fitted your teeth on plates so accurately
that they can be replaced without difficulty,
and will look nearly as well as before.
Besides
,
you need not wait for the gums to heal,
as I have a compositton for filling the
cavities
so that I can place them on at once. Look
at them are they not beautiful?'
`My poor teeth!' she said, sighing as she
glanced at them. `Could you find no person,
Doctor?'
`I should prefer replacing these, madam.'
`No. The idea of false teeth, gold plates
in my mouthI could not endure the thought.
I should feel as if I were made of wires and
plated! Is there no alternative!'
`There
is
a young weman who is willing to
lose her teeth,' said the Doctor dropping his
voice; `but really they are so perfect
nature
has made such a pretty piece of work of
itthat I should regret to mar it.'
`Are they
so
beautiful.'
`As beautiful as your own
were
.'
`Were! it is indeed
were
. Doctor I must
have these teeth of hers. But is she young.'
`Young and lovely. She is now in the
next room.
`Let me see herno, I should rather not,
on second thoughtI should feel so
awkward
in meeting her afterwards. Does she
know who wants her to make the sacrifice?'
`No.'
`Do not let her. Yet, I would like to see
her. She may be abut you would not
deceive
me.'
`She is as fair as the snow. Come hither.
Do you see the well-turned point of that shoe
and instep, just visible within the room?'
`I do. She is a young lady!'
`Such a foot can belong to none other.'
The Dentist having placed his patient and
her victim in arm-chairs in their respective
rooms, now prepared to go through his
painful
duty. Having carefully measured the
depth of each of the cavities in Mrs.
Wharton's
mouth, he irritated the inner surface
and made a slight incision on the sides so as
to draw blood. Then, going into the room
where Caroline was patiently and resolutely
seated, he drew one of her teeth with such
skill and ease as scarcely to give her pain,
and returned with it into the room he had
left. He measured it by the previously
ascertained
measures of the depth of the
corresponding
bed, when finding it a little too
long, he clipped off the end and quickly and
most skilfully placed it in the cavity he had
prepared for it. In this manner he extracted
four teeth from Caroline's head, and inserted
them in Mrs. Wharton's, who under the
operation
suffered far more pain than she who
had made the greater sacrifice. The whole
operation occupied about twenty minutes.
The teeth were beautifully reset, and when
Mrs. Wharton looked in a small mirror he
placed before her, she uttered,
notwithstanding
the inflamation and pain she still
suffered, an involuntary scream of delight.
`Doctor, bless you! The poor girl! She
did not even cry out! Take this and reward
her, and also give her from me, this diamond
ring,' she added, removing a brilliant from
her finger, and placing it, with a roll of bank
notes in his hand.
`You will take no food, Mrs. Wharton,
that will require you to use your teeth, for
three days, and will speak as little as you
can in the mean time. It will be necessary
with a preparation I shall give you, to bathe
the gums repeatedly and keep your mouth
as much closed for a day or two as possible.
Be careful also of the cool air. I will call
and see you to-morrow.'
Having received the wash he had
prepared
,
Mrs. Wharton took leave of the dentist
with smiles, and he was left alone with the
noble victim of female vanity. Mrs.
Wharton
was a sensible and pleasing woman! a
kind and generous hearted woman! But what
will not a beautiful woman consent to, be it
never so cruel, to preserve or restore a charm!
Let those ladies who would condemn Mrs.
Wharton, withhold their judgment till they
have been placed precisely in her situation.
We neither condemn nor defend herfor
gentlemen are not fair judges in a case which
can never fall precisely within their persenal
experience. As to the conduct of Caroline
Archer my readers can have but one
opinion
.
This noble girl felt no painno grief at
the marring of her beautyas one by one
she gave her beautiful teeth to the fangs of
the despoiling iron. She only thought of the
relief she was to afford her beloved mother
that for three months longer she was securing
to her a roof and a home.
`You are a noble girl! I am sorry I have
done this,' said the Doctor, as he returned to
her. `Distress I fear has driven you to it.
I would rather have forfeited the Lady's
custom
and the favour of her whole caste than
have done this wicked thing! Why did you
not ask me for money? I would rather have
given one hundred dollars than had this done.
But it is too late now to lament. But then
you are such a noble girl! Some lofty and
honest purpose had strengthened your spirit
or you could never have borne pain as you
have done. I must now repair, to the best
of my power, the devastation I have made.'
`The blood soon ceased flowing and in a
few minutes the inflammation became so far
reduced that he took up the pairs of teeth he
had fitted to the plate and asked her if he
should put them in their place.
`Will you give me a mirror, sir?'
`Not now, child. I will first fix these teeth
in.'
`
Now
, if you please sir.'
He gave her the glass. She glanced into
it, witnessed her disfigurement, and, like a
true hearted woman as she was, burst into
tears. They were soon dried up; and when
a few minutes afterwards the dentist again
handed her the mirror, she sprung to her feet
with delight, no less great than Mrs.
Wharton
had shown. `They are like my own.'
`They are indeed,' said the dentist,
viewing
this effect of his skill with gratification;
`I hope they will supply their place. They
will feel uncomfortably a day or two, but you
will soon become accustomed to them. Now,
miss, you desired twenty dollars. Here are
one hundred dollars, the sum which the lady
gave me for you as she promised to do. Here
also is a ring worth as much more, which she
took from her finger, and desired me to give
you in token of her gratitude.'
`Caroline took the ring and the money,
scarcely believing the reality of what she
heard. Then clasping together her hands,
she sent up a silent offering of thanksgiving
to him who had given her the virtue and
courage
to make the sacrifice of that natural
female
vanity common to all the young and
lovely of her sex.
`She is young, she is beautiful, and she is
pious, soliloquized Dr. , as he listened
to her light footstep on the last stair as she
retired. `I wish she had told me her history.
She is a noble girl. I must find her out!
What a lovely bride she would make. I must
know who she is. She is in humble life, and
she is very poor; doubtless in pressing
misery
,
or she would hardly have made the
sacrifice
she has to-day. Pete;'
`Thir!' cried a woolly-pated African lad,
about fourteen years old, popping his head
inio the door and grinning from ear to ear,
with a half-smothered laugh he had brought
in from the street.
`You are here, are you, you scape-grace?
Did you see that young woman go out?'
`Yeth, thir.'
`Follow, and see where she goes in, and
bring me the name and number of the house.
If you play by the way, I'll thrash you.'
`Yeth thir.'
`I will find her, and if she be respectable,
be she poor as a parish priest's cow, I'll
marry
her if she'll have me.'
Thus meditated Dr. ; and lighting
his cigar, he gave himself up to a train of
delightful hymeneal visions, which, like `the
baseless fabric' of most bachelors' dreams,
were destined, alas! to leave `no wreck
behind
.'
CHAPTER IX.
Mrs. Wharton
drove home, and with
pleasure exhibited her restored teeth to her
delighted husband and brother Frank; but
without telling them they had been an hour
before in the head of a young girl. Percy
she knew would be displeased, while she
feared Frank's satire. So she kept her own
secret, and left upon their minds the hest
impression
of Dr. 's skill.
Frank soon after took his hat, stick, and
gloves, to go to the Gazette office to see if he
could hear any thing of his pocket-book which
he had dropped in returning from the six
o'clock New York boat, to which he had
been to see a party of friends off.
`You will scarcely recover it, Frank,' said
Percy as he was going out, `you deserve to
lose it for carrying so large a sum about you
daily. No gentleman, when he is at home,
should make a practice of keeping more than
twenty dollars in his pocket-book at a time.'
`I care more about the miniature on it for
which alone I bought it in Paris, fancying it
resembled a school girl I used to know. But
what makes it more valuable is that I have
within a day or two seen a charming creature
in a milliner's store in Walnut street, that is
the perfect resemblance of it. I wouldn't
have lost it for the value of the notes in it.'
`Have a care, Frank. These Philadelphia
grizettes
are the most dangerous in the world.'
`She is perfectly lovely, Percy. A small
white hand, like a high bred girl, and an eye
and lip so eloquent with expression and purity
of soul, that'
`You fell in love with her.'
`I have, I positively believe. Her
wonderful
likeness to my miniature first struck
me.'
`Your earnest manner, brother Frank, is
ominous of danger to both herself and you.
Do not pursue the acquaintanceit can only
end in her ruin and your own dishonor.'
`By heaven, Percy! you wrong my
motives
,
I tell you she is divinely beautiful,
and so pure that an impure thought cannot
live in her presence.'
`You are in love, Frank, and very romantic
withal. I hope nothing worse than romance
will come of it. Emma will have to pick out
some fair girl as a wife for you. It's time
you were married, Frank.'
`I mean to be one of these daysI
wonder
who this lovely milliner can be!'
`Daughter of some honest tradesman, like
enough, perhaps, your boot-maker's niece!'
answered Percy, with playful but severe
irony.
Frank colored, bit his lip, and hastily
descended
from the drawing-room to the hall.
As he reached the door, the street bell was
rung, and on opening it, he saw a handsome
little lame boy, with a pale face, but dark
eyes, full of intellect and intelligence. He
was at once interested in his appearance.
`Who do you wish to see, my little lad?'
he inquired, in a gentle tone.
`Mr. Francis Astley.'
`I am he.'
`Did you lose a pocket-book, sir?'
`I did.'
`A green one?'
`A green one with a miniature in it.'
`Here it is sir. My sister found it in
Walnut
street this morning.'
With these words, the boy took from his
pocket a snowy cambric handkerchief, and
unfolding it, delivered to him his pocket book.
The name of `Caroline Archer' prettily
written
on one corner of the handkerchief caught
his eye before it was returned to his pocket.
`Will you see if the contents are safe, sir?'
`Its of no consequence, my good boy. I
hardly remember what sum was in it,' said
Frank, opening it and just glanced at the
notes.
`There were three hundred and
seventy-five
dollars in it when it was found sir.'
`I now remember that was the amount.
Come into the hall, and I will count it to
gratify
you.'
He found it correct, and taking the
seventy-five
dollars, presented it to the boy.
`No, I thank you, sir.'
`It is yours. Take it my lad.
`I have only returned your pocket book, sir.
I have merited no reward.`
`If you will not take it, you have no right
to refuse it for your sister. Take this one
hundred dollar bill, and tell her the owner of
the pocket book presents it to her for her
integrity
.
It will purchase her wedding
ornaments
one of these days. She must be a nice
girl. How much younger than you is she?'
`She is older, sir. I am fifteen and she is
seventeen,' he replied, receiving the note.
`Ah! What is your name?'
`Henry Archer.'
`Where do you live?'
`In  alley.'
`Hum! Well, I must do something for you,
my fine lad. Come and see me this time on
Monday. Why do you linger? Would you
ask me any question?'
`I would rather have my sister's miniature,
sir, than money.'
`Your sister's miniature, sir!'
`Yes, sirin the pocket book. I will
gladly
return you the hundred dollars for it, if you
please sir.'
`Is this is a likeness of your sister who
found it?'
`Yes, sir. And ma wonders how you came
to have it. She hopes, and so do I, sir, that
there's nothing wrong about it.'
`Gothing wrong my lad. Is your sister a
milliner's apprentice?'
`Yes, sir, in Walnut street.'
`The very same!' exclaimed Frank,
half-audibly
.
`Sir.'
`Nothing, my lad. I will let you have the
picture one of these days, perhaps. Her
name is Caroline Archer, is it?'
`Yes, sir.'
`That will do. Don't forget to come to me
on Monday.
With these words, Francis Astley
accompanied
the lad to the door, and let him out.
`Well, this is extraordinary. Fortune is
entangling the thread of my life with this
pretty milliner, it is plain. Well, there is
no resisting fate.' And with this conclusive
reasoning, he sallied forth to lounge down
Ghestnut street.
CHAPTER X.
One
forenoon, a few weeks after the
events just related, a young girl was seated
in the elegant working-room of Mrs.
Wharton
,
at No.  Girard Place. Mrs. Wharton
had some gala dress to be cut and fitted, and
being a little indisposed, sent to Mrs. Carvil
for her `best hand.' Caroline Archer was
sent. When she reached the door and
recognized
the number, she remembered that
it was the same that was in the pocket-book.
She hesitated to enter, lest she should
encounter
young Astley, whom she had not
seen since the day before she had found it.
But she was not mistress of her own will,
and ringing the bell was admitted. In the
interval between the time of the foregoing
chapter and the present, Caroline's domestic
happiness had much increased, by means of
the costly price she had paid to secure it.
Her mother's health was improving, and she
had numerous little comforts of which she was
before destitute. A private school teacher
of great celebrity had also written her a note
saying that arrangements for three years
tuition
of her eldest son had been made with
him by a young gentleman, and that his seat
and place in his classes were waiting for
him. This was gladly and gratefully
accepted
by the mother. Caroline still
continued
,
however, at Mrs. Carvil's, but returning
prosperity and hope had restored to her cheek
its bloom, and to her eye its brilliancy, and
to her lip its smile. So well had Dr.
done his part, that no one, save himself and
her mother, was possessed of her secret.
She had cut and fitted the waist of the ball
dress upon which she had been at work, and
it being of a new and showy fashion, Mrs.
Wharton wished to have Percy's opinion
aware that in female dress gentlemen have
unerring taste. She sent to the library for
him.
`What do you think of it, Percy?' she
inquired
,
after showing him how finely it fitted
her magnificent bust. `Is it not a rich
pattern
,
and of a superb fashion?'
`I know not which most to admire, the
perfection
of the fit or the skill of the
artiste
,' he
said, looking with admiration at the beautiful
milliner. `This must be Frank's inamorata,
for she is just such a divine creature as he
described,' he added to himself. `I will soon
learn.'
`You may go now, Percy, I don't want you
any longer,' said the bride, with a meaning
smile, observing his admiration of the
maiden
.
`I want Frank to see your dress; he has
perfect taste in such matters,' replied Percy.
catching her eye and laughing, as he showed
that he understood her
ruse
. `He is in the
library, poring over Ovid's Art of Love. I
will have him here in a moment.'
`Don't bring Frank here!' she said,
glancing
at Caroline.
`He
must
come.'
When Frank entered the room, Caroline,
with a throbbing bosom, instinctively shrunk
within the window recess, her services not
being immediately in requisition.
`A superb fit, sis,' said Frank, `but let me
tell you it is the
least
in the world a little too
low in theneckI mean bosom.'
`Not a bit, as the fashion is.'
`If it were the fashion tobut I'm mum.
How are your new teeth? Do you believe
me, I think they are more beautiful than
those you lost!'
`Sh! brother!' and Mrs. Wharton
directed
her glance warningly towards the recess.
But Caroline heard every word the young
gentleman had uttered. With an involuntary
exclamation she turned from the window and
was gazing, when he looked, with surprise
and curiosity upon Mrs. Wharton.
`Caroline Archer!'
Caroline was overwhelmed with confusion
at the recognition and his ardent
exclamation
.
`I knew it,' exclaimed Percy, half-aloud.
`Do you know her, Frank?' asked Mrs.
Wharton, suspiciously.
`Look there!' he answered. And opening
his pocket-book he displayed the miniature
within. `Do you remember when I bought
this in Paris.'
`I do. It is perfect.'
`It is only through this likeness I know
her then, sister.'
At this instant the door bell rung, and the
next moment Dr. , the dentist, entered
the room.
`I called as I was passing, Madam, to see
howwhatmy noble little heroine here!'
`Do you know her too, Doctor?' asked
Mrs. Wharton, with surprise
`Pray let me look at your teeth, Miss,'
cried the Doctor, without replying to her
question, and walking directly up to
Caroline
`I
have wished a hundred times to see
how they answered the purpose.'
Caroline retreated in embarrassment, and
felt as if she should sink upon the ground.
`Do not be alarmed! you were courageous
enough a few weeks ago. Well, Mrs.
Wharton
,
so you have found her out and taken her
as a
protege
.'
`Found who out! Pray explain, Doctor.'
`Why my brave, beautiful heroine!'
`Whom do you mean?'
`Why the pretty `advertisement girl,' as
I call her.'
Mrs. Wharton turned pale.
`You do not mean to say thatthat' and
the lady finished her sentence by a look
directed
towards Caroline.
`That she is the young person who'
`No more, DoctorI beg of you to e
silent
.'
she cried imploringly, sinking upon an
ottoman near her.
`Pray, what is this mystery, Doctor?
demanded
the astonished Percy.
`I see I have been led into a sad blunder
by taking things for granted. But it is
better
to explain than leave things in mystery.
This is the young woman who sacrificed her
front teeth to supply the loss of your lady's.'
`Emily, is this so?' demanded Percy, with
indignant reproof. `Were not those
manufactured
teeth you obtained from Dr. ?'
`No, Percy,' she answered, hiding her face
in her hand.
`Good God! have you had the cruelty to
bribe a young creature like this to make such
a sacrifice to your vanity! Alas, my dear
Emma! you have fallen, fallen far in my
estimation
.'
`Forgive me, Percy!' she cried, throwing
herself upon his shoulder`I confess my
errorI have not been happy since!'
`First make all the reparation in your
power to this young creature, whom nothing
but dire necessity could have driven to make
such a sacrifice; and of this necessity the
bride of Percy Wharton has taken
advantage
.'
Mrs. Wharton burst into tears.
`Nay, sirpardon her!' cried Caroline,
with generous feeling for the contrition of
the unhappy lady. `The sacrifice I made
was voluntary on my part and with
Heaven's
blessing was the means of saving a
beloved
mother from misery, and making a
destitute family happy.'
`And did you make such a sacrifice, noble
girl, for a mother?'
`Indeed, sir, we were very much
distressed
and
if Providence had not opened
this way of relief to us, we should have been
houseless wanderers of the streets.'
`Emma, I forgive you, inasmuch as good
has been permitted to grow out of this evil.
Yet it does not exculpate you.'
With great delicacy and tact Percy
Wharton
then drew from the blushing girl her
whole story, save that part that transpired in
the dentist's room, which Doctor
related
with touching eloquence. Francis
Astley also on his part related the loss and
recovery of his pocket-book, and increased
the admiration of Percy and his wife to the
highest pitch. When the tale was ended, he
asked if her father's name was not Henry
Archer, formerly an importer in Front street?'
`It was, sir,' answered Caroline.'
`Then he did my father when he was a
young man a great and important service.
It shall be my pleasing duty to repay it to
his child. Give me your mother's address,
and I will call on her early to-morrow.'
`And permit me to say, Miss Archer,'
added
Mrs. Wharton, approaching her and
taking
her hand, `that I shall insist on taking
you henceforth under my protection, and
from this moment request you will make my
house your home, and look upon me as a
sister.'
`You are a noble creature, Emily, when
you let your heart take the lead of your head,'
said her husband, kissing her. `You have
my consent to whatever you will.'
`And if my good brother will give me his
consentand my generous sister will
transfer
also her proffered protection of this
gentle
girl,' said Francis Astley, advancing and
taking Caroline's remaining hand, `I will
with her sweet consent, cheerfully give my
hand where weeks since I gave my heart.'
He bent gracefully over the fair hand as
he spoke, and imprinted upon it an ardent
kiss. Caroline, overwhelmed with the
sudden
and unexpected crowding in of events,
and with her full heart gushing joy at this
reward of her long and silently cherished
love for the handsome stranger of the gloves,
stood with drooping eyelids, blushing like a
peony, while her young bosom tumultuously
heaved as if it would burst its confinement.
It is two months since Caroline Archer left
the boarding school of Mrs. , Chesnut
street, where she had been fifteen months;
her betrothed husband, Mr. Frank Astley,
being too impatient to be married and sport
his lovely wife at the Springs this season, to
wait the three years he had promised Percy.
Therefore, yesterday there appeared in the
Gazette the following notice under the
Hymeneal
head:
`Married this morning at eight o'clock
en
costume des voyage
, Francis Astley, Esq., of
this city, to Miss Caroline Archer, daughter
of the late Henry Archer, Esq The happy
pair started immediately for Saratoga via
New York. There is an
on dit
that some
more than ordinary romance
d'amour
was the
foundation of this union of the parties.'

Joseph Hott
.
One
afternoon, after dinner, two young
gentleman were seated in a private and
luxuriously
furnished apartment, at the Carlton
House. The deep folds of the curtains were
dropped across the windows, and the light of
the western sun passing through them
diffused
a rich mellow glow throughout the room.
One of the gentlemen occupied a sofa, lolling
at full length, and the other was comfortably
seated in a softly cushioned arm chair of
velvet
.
They were both smoking, one a long
slender clay pipe filled with fragrant
Scarfalati
,
the other a bright brown Regalia! A
decanter of the richest Sherry, such as Mr.
Henry Hodges loves to give his particular
friends, with an unopened bottle of
Steinberger
,
and a cork-screw stood on a marble
table
within their reach.
On the opposite sides of the table, where
they had just replaced them, were wine
glasses
half-filled with the amethystine nectar, and
glowing in the warm rich light from the
curtains
.
Everything around them looked
comfortable
,
and they appeared like gentlemen
who particularly love to take their ease after
dinner. The individual on the sofa was a
very elegant fellow in a handsome dressing
gown, with soft brown hair waiving to his
collar, and a pair of dark whiskers arranged
with great taste. His complexion was that
dark-pearly hue, mingled with an agreeable
red, so common to New York gentlemen,
being
smooth and delicate, yet healthy. His
cheek was now a little flushed, and his dark
hazel eyes brighter, and his lip redder than
their wont. He was about twenty-six years
of age, his name was Lionel Linton, and he
was of good family and had very respectable
connexions. He was unmarried, and having
at his annual disposal an income of three
thousand dollars, he had no profession, but
lived an idle, indolent, fashionable life. He
had every quality, however, calculated to
make any reasonable woman a happy
husband
,
being domestically inclined, good
tempered
,
of an easy, amiable disposition, and
frank and generous to a fault. He had good
sense and judgment, and he had just began
to feel that he was wasting life without
having
accomplished any adequate end for the
gift of it, either for his own honor or the
benefit
of mankind! In fine he felt that he must
get married! He had, therefore, been
several
months looking out for a wife, and had
already
seen in Broadway a young lady of
great personal attractions, whom half
resolved
to make his wife if she would consent to
be his. He had not, however, even spoken
with her nor did he know who she was: that
she was highly respectable, he was aware
from having seen her walking in company
with ladies whom he knew to belong to the
highest condition in society! Such was the
state and crisis of Lionel Linton's
matrimonial
prospects at the period of our story: and,
now as he reclined there smoking, he could
not help thinking how much prettier object a
sweet bride would be seated, sewing or
reading
opposite to him in the place of his friend
of the pipe, to look at!
The young gentleman on the other side of
the table, who had suggested this sensible
reflection, was named
Henry Lee
, by the
clergyman who christened him at Grace
Church, but irreverent laymen invariably
called
him Harry Lee. He was a short, joyous
looking young gentleman of about
twenty-five
,
with a jovial round face, a bright
twinkling
blue eye, short curly brown hair,
beautifully
white teeth and a hand like a lady's
for fairness, though something fat, for his
whole person was inclined to corpulency, his
abdomen already beginning to aspire to
aldermanic
dignity. He had his coat off and
was in his shirt sleeves; his head was thrown
back in an attitude of narcotic felicity as he
puffed at his pipe; his short feet were stuck
up, parallel to each other, over the back of a
chair in front of him; his long pipe stem was
supported delicately between a thumb and
finger, and his whole attitude was one of
fleshy luxury! Like his friend Lionel, he was
a bachelor sojourner at the Cariton, and the
recipient of something less than three
thousand
dollars per annum from an incumbered
estate left him by his grand-father, who had
been an influential burgher in the olden days
of the city. He was a good natured, `whole
souled fellow,' always smiling and looking
like a happy dog; always mellow after
dinner
and very fond of kicking up rows and
knocking down `Charles,' but all in good
nature, for he was, as every one of his friends
whom he lent money to swore, one of `the
best-natured fellows in the world!' He had
remained a bachelor because he could never
find a woman that had a foot to please his
fastidious eye! Harry's notions of female
perfection were peculiar! He always judged
woman by the shape and symmetry of her
foot; it was with him literally
ex-pede
Herculem
.
If he had a passion for anything
besides
tipping over `Charlies,' and for a good
glass of brown Sherry, it was for a neat and
faultless foot! His glance as he would
promenade
that `walk of beauty,' Broadway, was
always directed to the feet of the pretty
women
,
their walk and manner of placing the
foot to the pavement. He has been heard to
deliver a lecture by the hour,
after dinner
, on
a lady's foot! If Harry, therefore, ever chose
a wife he would be sure to select her rather
for a divine foot than a divine face. But,
though, tired of living at hotels and being
alone so much in his rooms, and anxious to
get a wife, he had never yet found any one
to suit him!
`I say, my dear boy,' he said after a long
and reflecting silence, and without removing
the stem of his pipe from his lips, or turning
his head; `I say, Linton, I have been
thinking
we are a brace of precious fools.'
`So have I just been thinking the same
thing, Harry,' replied Lionel, emitting from
his mouth a wreath of rich blue tobacco
smoke and sending it curling above his
head. `But what has brought
you
to this
conclusion.'
`Thinking what a poor devil's life I lead
here when there is some lovely creature, if I
knew where to find her, with a foot like an
angel, stepping on rosy clouds, ready to make
me a happy fellow! Only think how
charming
it would be to have a pretty wife setting
beside me to fill my pipe, and two or three
sweet little cherubs of boys and girls to ride
across my legs as I have 'em stretched across
the chair, and call me `Papa!' What led
you, Linton, to say `Amen' to it so readily,
hey?'
`Thinking of pretty much the same thing,
to tell the truth,' said Lionel Linton, coloring
and laughing. `I am half of a mind, Harry,
to turn Benedict, in good earnest;' and the
handsome Lionel Linton smoked his segar
for a few puffs with more animation than
before
.
`Yes, Linton,' said Harry, taking out his
pipe from his mouth and pricking the bowl,
`that is very easily said; but where in the
deuce is the wife to come from?'
`There are hundreds of beautiful women
in New York, of our acquaintance; we could
soon pick out a good wife, Harry, if we would
only make up our minds
to marry!
'
`But a beautiful woman is one thing, and
a beautiful woman with a pretty foot is
another
.
I always find something deficient!'
`But we must not look for physical
perfection
in the sex, Harry. I am satisfied with a
lovely face and figure, which is the casket of
a good heart and generous mind; I can
forgive
a woman who possesses these, if she
should happen to wear No. 3's.'
`Number threes!' exclaimed Harry, `I
would'nt look at a woman who wore number
threes, in seeking for a wife! Number one
in summerNo. 1 1-2 in winter, is my
standard
of perfection! Number threes!'
`But number threes may be in just
proportion
,
nevertheless, to the lady's figure! if she
be tall and noble sized! I have seen ladies
with
too
small feet for their size, and it was
a glaring deformity!'
`That may be, too, Linton! What I want
is a wife whose person shall be moulded in
the divinest mould of female symmetry: a
just hand and foota just height and
proportion
to the charming whole! But I would
not marry a girl with a face like an angel
and with a form like Juno's if she wore
number
threes!'
`Then you want a
petite
wife, that you can
tuck under your arm like an umbrella.'
`No, not that! A woman may be a warm
and living Venus
de Medici
, aud wear no
larger shoe than a French number one! I
have measured the foot of the Venus, and
found it exactly
ones
. And would you call
a girl the size and proportions of a Venus
de Medici
, a
petite
to be tucked under my
arm like an umbrella?' Harry in the heat of
his argument had turned round full to Linton
who could not help smiling at his earnest
manner.
`Well, well, Harry, yoo may marry for the
foot and I will marry for the face and its
expression
!'
`Expression!' repeated Harry; `why, my
dear fellow, there is much
expression
in a
woman's foot, as in her face!'
`Ha! ha! ha!' laughed Linton; `you are
fairly crazy, upon the subject, my dear
fellow
!'
`It is true,' repeated Harry, drinking off
his glass; `will you deny there is expression
in forms?'
`How do you mean?'
`An outline and shape. For instance is
there no expression in a profile?'
`To be sure.'
`Is there any in a foreheadin its mere
outline?'
`I think there is.'
`Think! I know there is. Painters and
sculptors will tell you there is. Did you ever
see Daniel Webster's forehead, or Charles
Sprague's?'
`Yes.'
`Well, will you say that there is no
individuality
of expression in these features?'
`I think I understand you.'
`How can you help it? Form that has life
in it possesses individual expressionhas its
own
proprium
. Have you seen a hand that
you could say of it, `this is the hand of an
assassinthis of an avaricious manthis of
a benevolent man?'
`This is a strange theory, Harry. Did you
find it in the floating smoke of your
Scarfalati
,
or discover it in the bottom of your
emptied
wine-glass.
`Nature and truth taught it me, and they
teach it to every man who will learn of them,
I contend that there is infinite expression in a
woman's foot! A perfect foot, neat, shapely,
airy, and daintily turned, has an expression to
my mind identical with that which constitutes
our abstract ideas of beauty! The character
of the woman is discovered by itfor the
outline and outward grace of the body is the
index of the being that dwells in it. Now
low, coarse or vulgar woman could never
express
to the eye a self-contradiction.'
`Henry's Sherry has mounted you on the
top of metaphysics, Harry,' said Lionel,
laughing, yet half inclined to assent to the
truth of his doctrine on the female `
understanding
.'
`You may believe what I say or not,
Linton
,
but I am morally convinced of its truth!
By Heaven, I would be willing to choose a
wife by her foot, without seeing her face!'
`You would, Harry?'
`I would, upon my honor.'
`Well, then, let us both decide this very
moment to marry and look out each for his
wife. I will choose mine for her face,' he
added gaily, if you will chose one for her
foot!'
`Done,' cried Harry, getting up and
grasping
Linton's hand, `and I will bet you I will
get the fairest wife.'
`Done be it,' said Linton, returning the
grasp of his hand; `suppose, Harry, we
decide
to select one, you by the foot, I by the
face,
this very afternoon!
Broadway is now,
and will be for the next two hours, tronged
with the beauty of the city! If men who are
to select wives by the eye cannot choose in
such a galaxy of loveliness, they deserve to
go blind.'
`But, suppose, we should find out
afterwards
on inquiry, that they were engaged?'
said Harry, a little posed by this
extraordinary
proposition from his friend, who very well
knew
he
should meet the young lady there
whose beauty, as he daily passed her at the
hour of promenade, had made such an
impression
upon him.
`In that case, Harry, we will both try
again,' he answered gaily. `Come, let us
sally forth on our matrimonial expedition.'
`Agreed, Linton; I will bring myself to
the agreement,' said Harry, with animation,
pouring out a glass of sherry; `let us toast
our future wives.'
Linton joined him, and the toast was drank
standing. Harry now put on his trock coat,
and the more finical Linton his
dress
coat,
while both paid more than their usual
attention
after
dinner, to their toilet.
`Now, Harry, we are to choose a wife this
afternoon,
at all events
, from some one we see
between this and sun-setthat is decided!'
`Dededecided,' repeated Harry, who
was just mellow enough to be very happy.
`But s'pose, Linton, s'pose she won't have
us!
That would be a fix, hey?'
`That will of course absolve us from our
mutual pledge, Harry! I am resolved to have
a wife in earnest, if I can get one.'
`And if we don't, Lion', boy, let's ad
advertise
forforonepretty foot, hey?'
`Come, Harry; don't take any more wine!
You have got just enough to make you a
good judge of a pretty foot!'
`Have I, Lion'? Well, I wont! But it's
a pity to leave such a nice bottle of Stein
wine for perperquisites to that tiptippling
waiter, Pete. Do I vibrate, Lint?'
`No, Harry; your legs are steady enough,
but your tongue is confoundedly drunk.'
`I will not ppopop the question, then,
if I see a pprpretty foot, 'till it gets
sober
.'
`No; we are to follow, without attracting
particular observation, each our prize 'till we
ascertain where she lives, and then devise
means to be introduced to her family; and
then hey for love and matrimony!' said
Linton
with a little excitement in his manner.
`The idea, Linton, between you and I, the
idea of marrying makes me feel weak about
the sststomach!'
`
Courage, mon ami! en avant!
' and the
two candidates for matrimony sallied forth
from their hotel arm in arm, and fell into the
mingling currents that flowed along the
western
and fashionable
pave
.
Caroline Le Roy stood before her full
length toilet-glass, surveying her lovely
person
,
which was tastefully arrayed in a rich
walking dress. A fashionable hat was on
her head, the snowy plumes of which as they
depended to her shoulder, were mocked by
the brilliancy of the ermine throat and cheek
it delicately shaded! Her features were of
that lovely and softly rounded outline which
is peculiar to American females in their
teens; and she was but nineteen. Her eyes
were blue, large and full of tenderness, with
a serene, spiritual expression! Her figure
was tall and harmoniously graceful,
conveying
in every motion that kind of pleasure to
the eye that harmony of numbers does to the
ear! Her beauty was faultless, save the
hand and foot! the first, though covered by
an unsullied pea-green glove of the softest
kid, was too large for the arm, as if she had
spread it, by the foolish plan in vogue of
placing
girls at the piano before they can clasp
an
octave
, and so compelling them to spread
the fingers 'till the hand looks webbed-like,
like, we were about to say a shark's fin; in
this manner had Caroline Le Roy evidently
disfigured and distorted her hand! It was a
great pity, for it was as white as down, and
veined on the back with the most delicate
pencilling of blue. But she had not the
same apology for her foot! It was too large
to admit of any apology, and cramped in
number threes, though it was a good number
four! Now, a large foot is very bad, but a
large foot cramped into a shoe a number too
small, is worse still! A large foot cannot be
helped, but a pinched foot can! It plumps
it up on the top, destroying the easy outline;
it draws in the instep, spoiling the walk, and
is a source of ceaseless torment and pain to
the owner, Whatever size be the foot, let
its shoe neatly fit it, and then if it be not so
small, it at least will not be deformed!
These observations are extracted from a
journal lately kept by Harry Lee!
Miss Virginia Le Roy glanced over her
costume and person with a look of
satisfaction
;
but her eyes did, for one instant, linger
with disapproval on her feet, and she sighed
to think it was not a little smaller, for she
was one of those who look upon a small foot
as a mark of high aristocratic birth. She
took her sun-shade in her hand, and leaving
her door in Eighth street, was, a few
moments
afterwards, on Broadway, wishing
half hoping she should meet that handsome
fellow in brown hair, who had so often
passed
her with a respectful look of ardent, yet
modest admiration.
She had not gone far, when a young
graceful
little Hebe, dressed half like a woman,
half like a school-girl, about seventeen years
of age, came tripping towards her from
Bleecker street. A smile was on her face, a
light in her bright black eyes, and her
beautiful
hand extended to take that of her friend.
`How do you do, Virginia?'
`How
do
you do, Ellen?'
And their lips met in a warm kiss of
girlish
friendship.
`Are you going down Broadway?'
`Yesto Stewarts', for a mantle.'
`I was going to Madame Canda's, to call
on Julia Carrol; but, as it is early yet, I will
join you,' said the new comer, and the young
ladies proceeded down Broadway side by
side, and in animated conversation. A
lovelier
or more
spirituelle
creature than Ellen
Leigh could not be conceived to exist on this
lower earth. Her form was slight, yet full,
and faultless to the eye of the most
fastidious
!
Her face was, however, not so
beautiful
as it was sensible and intelligent! Her
extraordinary beauty lay in the grace and
expression
of her figure. Her ungloved hand,
as she took Virginia Le Roy's, was small,
tapering, and white as the lily and
seemingly
as purely soft in texture. Her waist was
enchantment! but
her foot!
Spirit and shade
of Harry Lee! where wert thou? It was
divine
literally
divine!
How can such just
perfection be described? They were so
small that you could compass them across
the instep; harmonious in all their fascinat
ing proportions and undulating outline, with
a bewitching movement as she tripped along,
like two sweet birds lighting and alighting
along the pavement! Their expression was
actually joyous, to speak after Harry's
theory
.
They were encased in a pair of the
prettiest French laced boots, of a delicate
fawn color, that seemed to be a part and
parcel
of the graceful feet they covered.
`Where have you been for an age, Ellen?'
asked Caroline, glancing at her feet, with an
envious feeling in her heart.
`To Troy, for three months past. How
delighted I am to get back to the city! It is
so dull out of New-York. Dear delightful
Broadway! how happy I am to be in it once
more. Are you engaged yet to any body
Caro?'
`Engaged, Ellen, why no!'
`I suppose your favorite song, then is
`Why don't the men propose mama,
Why don't the men propose?'
`What a rattle brain! I shan't think of
marrying till I am twenty.'
`And you are over nineteen now!
I
mean
to marry soon as I find a good, clever, nice,
handsome, light-hearted, good natured fellow,
who will let me do just as I want to, and
never scold me! There comes two
handsome
young fellows! I don't like the tall one
he looks too grave and morbid! The
shorter one looks like a merry gentleman
`after dining out!' Why how you blush,
Carolineand how the tall handsome one
stares at you! Did you ever see him before?
And, good Heavens, how the other is
watchiug
my feet as he approaches! I wonder if
my boot is untied? Yes, I declare it is, and
the silk cord trailing in the dust!'
By this time our matrimonial speculating
heroes had come up nearly abreast of them.
Lionel had recognized at a distance, one of
them as his unknown beauty, and Harry had
discovered the other to have the most
symmetrical
feet his imagination had ever
conceived
of. Both gentlemen, therefore
insensibly
lessened their pace when they
approaehed
them, one with his admiring eyes
the while resting on the embarrassed, yet
pleased Caroline's blushing face, the other
with his rapturous gaze fixed on the feet that
had fascinated it. They forgot to give way
to the young ladies, who fairly turned aside
for them, when they recovered their
self-possession
,
and looked back! Caroline, also,
at the same instant, glanced back, and Ellen,
stopping, placed her foot on the inner
curb-step
of the walk that runs beneath the
windows
,
to fasten her boot. Harry was just
mellow enough to act from impulse, and
hastening
towards her, asked with a smile and
a polite bow, that from him was irresistable,
and which it was impossible to take offence
at.
`Will you allow me, miss, to fasten that
truant chord in the envious position to which
it seems so insensible?' and Harry
gracefully
bent on one knee.
Ellen looked at him, at the first instant,
gravely; but seeing how very modest and
civil his address was, and his words so
complimentary
withal, she replaced the foot
which she had withdrawn from the stone to
make her retreat from him, and said
laughingly
,
`You may tie it if you please, sirit is
very awkward to have one's boot or shoe
un-unlaced
in the street.'
`Very,' replied Harry, entwining the silken
chord around the bewitching ancle, his
senses
,
however, so bewildered by the sight and
touch of so exquisite a foot, that he worked
very bunglingly.
`You must not press my foot, sir,' she said
with a laugh and frown at the same time on
her face. `There, sir, I am extremely
obliged
to you,' she said, archly, as Harry rose to
his feet. `You can tie boots very well,' and
rejoining Caroline Le Roy, she tripped on
her way without looking back.
`Irony, there,' said Harry, looking after
her, `but what a foot! Linton, I am in for
it. Did you see that divine foot?French
number ones!'
`Confound your No. ones. Did you see
that heavenly face?'
`Confound your face! Did you observe
her symmetrical hand?hands and feet are
always of the same suit.'
`Did you notice her tall and graceful figure?
----face and figure always go together.'
`What a laugh!'
`What an eye!'
`What a fawn-like movement!'
`What a Juno-like tread!'
`You are speaking of the tall one,
Linton
.'
`Your are speaking of the shorter one,
Harry
.'
`So I am.'
`And so am I.'
`Are you for the tall one, in earnest,
Linton
?'
`Yes. And are you for the short one in
truth?'
`Yes. Such a foot never was before!'
`Nor such a face and figure!'
`As mine?'
`As
mine!
'
`Let us follow them, Linton, and find out
where they are! Oh, my poor heart!'
`It is a gone case with both of us, Harry.'
`I fear so!' and Harry sighed while he
took Linton's arm, and leisurely walked after
the two ladies, who, soon seeing that the two
gentlemen, in relation to whom each had
begun
to feel a little curiosity, led them a long
pursuit down Broadway, and back to Bleeker,
when Ellen took leave of her friend,
concluding
instead of going to Madame Canda's, to
return home.
`I wish,' she said, as they parted, `I knew
who that gentleman is that I so foolishly let
tie my boot! He has presumed upon it to
follow me 'till now! He has a handsome,
cheerful, good natured face, which I like.'
`I have more curiosity to learn who the
taller one is,' said Caroline. I have often met
him, and he always tries to meet my eyes. He
is evidently a gentleman, and though they
seem to follow us, they do so without positive
rudeness.
`Smitten with you, Caroline, and anxious
to know where you live.'
`And the other is then with you,' retorted
Coroline, blushing.
`We will see when I go down the street.'
`The one you like will follow you home to
see where you reside.'
`And the one
you
like, will follow you.'
`We will soon see,' said Caroline Le Roy,
laughing.
`And that shall decide which of them we
are to have for husbands,' said Ellen gaily,
having given utterance to more truth than
she was aware of.
The young ladies now separated, each
walking towards her own residence and our
heroes soon afterwards gaining the corner of
Bleecker street, parted from each other
Harry to lounge down this street, keeping
his intended bride in view, and Linton
continuing
along Broadway at an elegant
leisurely
gaitthe one 'till he saw Ellen Leigh, nor
unseen
by her, enter her father's door, and
the other, 'till he had satisfied himself where
the beautiful girl lived, whose charms had
produced such an effect upon his heart.
It was not a very difficult matter now, that
these important discoveries were made by
our heroes, for them to obtain, through
acquaintances
an introduction to the houses of
their singularly selected wives! They soon
became intimately acquainted with them,
formally
addressed them, and were accepted;
but then the fair betrothed were ignorant of
their mutual pledge to each other over their
glasses, to choose wives as they did, or
perhaps
it is very possible they
might
have said
`no,' when they would have had them say
`yes.' They both, however, had fairly fallen
in love with their intended brides
after
becoming
acquainted with them, and perhaps
this fact should be accepted in atonement.
At length they were married, and went in
company together to Saratoga, the Falls;
and came home again after a few weeks'
absence
,
to enter upon the responsible duties of
house-keeping. Harry found his wife's foot
proved indeed the index of her mind, that
her heart was as good and true as her
beautiful
foot was unrivalled in symmetry and
grace. Linton's wife was as lovely in
temper
as she was in person; and though Harry
said he could never forgive her for having a
foot, yet he could not but frankly confess to
Linton his conviction that a woman might
make a very good wife, though she wore
number threes!
PART II.
`Jealousy, with just cause, is virtue.
Groundless it hath no evil equal to't.'
Two
years passed away, two years of
uninterrupted
connubial happiness, and each of
our lovely brides had become mothers!
Never was a man so delighted at being a
parent, as Harry Lee, and of a bright, healthy
boy, too, on which he could brag over his
friend Lionel, whose beautiful wife presented
him with a little girl; but as it was the
perfect
miniature of his loved Caroline, he was
as well satisfied as Harry, though Harry's
boy was the picture of his `papa,'
`This is better than being a bachelor, hey,
Linton?' said Harry, one day, when they
had dined together at Lionel's house, and the
ladies had left the table to look after their
treasures in the nursery. `What a
delightful
creature my wife is! I advise every man
to choose his wife for her pretty foot!'
`Pshaw, Harry,' said Lionel, filling his
wine-glass with ruby Port. `Caroline has
rather a larger foot, perhaps, than I should
like myself, but she makes as good a wife as
if she had the feet of a Chinese beauty. I
would't change her for any lady that wears
number ones that I have ever seen.'
`Not for Ellen? My heavens, Linton, you
must have a gross taste, not to admire Ellen's
sweet little feet. My boy has got small feet,
toodevilish small! But then it don't signify
so much in a boy!'
`Here's a bumper to him, Harry! and may
he get a wife as lovely as his father has
obtained
.'
`And with as small feet,' added Harry,
with a cheek flushed with wine, drinking off
the bumper.
`Confound your small feet, Harry! Why,
what kind of extremities would your
grandchildren
have, in such case!'
`If they are girls, angelic ones!' replied
Harry, with animation. `But, by-the-by,
Lionel, have you and your pretty wife had
any matrimonial scenes together since you
have been married?'
`How do you mean?' asked Linton,
slightly
coloring, and looking into his wine glass,
as if watching the reflection of his face.
`Any little misunderstandings, squabbles,
you know, eh?' repeated Harry, with a
merry
twinkle in his mellow eyes.
`Why, no, not particularly, I believe,'
answered
Linton, embarrassed in his manner.
`Why do you ask?'
`Why, between you and me, Lionel, I
think she speaks a little sharper to you on
occasions than a sweet tempered wife should
do.'
`Indeed,' said Linton laughing and
blushing
,
`how did you discover that?'
`Oh, by accident, several times! But you
didn't seem to observe itat least, very
wisely
paid no attention to her, and so it passed.
And I said to myself, I'll bet two to one,
Linton
hasn't so sweet tempered a wife as I have.
She has, to tell you the truth, a little too
large a foot to be perfectly sweet tempered.
From more harmony and symmetry of person,
would have followed perfect harmony and
symmetry of disposition.'
`But hold, Harry! has your wife never
shown any temper? Have you never had
any of these matrimonial scenes you speak
of, eh, boy? Now out with the truth'and
Lionel glanced at the door, and lowered his
voice`we are alone.'
`Never, 'pon my honor, Linton! She is
invariably the same happy, cheerful creature,
with a most delightful disposition. She loves
me to devotion, and I repay her love with
adoration
.'
`Do you adore her, or her foot, Harry?'
`Her foot is the altar of the temple in
which my love worships! I kneel to that, but
my adoration is to the spirit that fills the fair
temple.'
`You are poetical, Harry! I believe you
speak truly of Ellen! She is indeed lovely
in her disposition.'
`Will you be as frank now about Caroline,'
said Harry, laughing and casting a
mischievous
glance at his friend.
`Well, to tell you the truth, Harry.' he
said in a subdued tone, with his eye upon the
door through which the two wives had passed
to the nursery, `Caroline has but one fault!
She is, naturally, the best tempered,
generous
,
noble-minded creature in the world, but
she isis'
`Out with it; jealous of Ellen's pretty
feet.'
`No, but jealous of
me
.'
`Of you! of you, most chaste and noble
Joseph!' cried Harry, laughing; `ha, ha, ha!
And who is the fair lady whose charms are
so dangerous to her peace?'
`Your wife, Harry,' said Linton, with a
quiet smile.
`
My
wife,' cried Harry, looking all at once
very grave; `what the devilwhat can she
think you have to do with my wife?'
`I can't tell,' replied Linton, amused at
Harry's sudden flash of incipient jealousy.
`Look here, Linton,
have
you been flirting
with Ellen, now?' seriously asked Harry,
with a most melancholy expression to his
usually
cheerful features. `Tell me the truth,
and I'll forgive youI will, upon my soul.'
`As I am a gentleman, and a man of
honor
,
no, my dear boy,' replied Linton, with a
sincerity, yet scarcely refraining from
laughter
at his friend's very serious visage.
`I knew it, my dear boy, Linton, I
knew
it
could not be so,' said Harry, giving a long
breath: `you don't know how devilish bad I
felt. Ellen loves me with all her soulbut
then these women are women, and there is no
knowing how to take them! The best way
is to keep a sharp eye on them! heh, heh,
heh! Linton?'
`Yes, if you want them to run away when
you go to sleep! A husband's frank and open
confidence in his wife, is the safest security
to his martial honor.'
`I believe you, Linton! If wives are false,
it is the husbands that teach them the first
lesson. I have ever had the most unlimited
confidence in Ellen? I regret that I should
for an instant, have believed she would flirt
even with youfor flirtation in a wife, is the
first rehearsal of inconstancy.'
`You utter a severe truth, Harry.'
`Truth is always severe,' answered Harry,
with a dignity that became the tone of his
thoughts at that moment. `But how is it that
Caroline has become jealous of you? and of
Ellen, too! It
must
have been of her feet!'
`I can hardly conceive. She first
manifested
it one day about four months ago,
when your Ellen, nurse and boy, were at my
house, and we were comparing babies.'
`I recollect the time, perfectly,' said
Harry
cracking an almond, yet listening with
deep interest.
`I then remarked, for you have talked so
much about small feet being essential to
beauty in woman, I had, in part, imbibed your
foolish notions, taking up my little Ellen's
foot, when she grew up, would be as small as
and pretty as her's.'
`Yes, yes, I remember, and Caroline spoke
up rather sharply, rather more so at least,
than became a loving wife of two years, and
said, while her cheek heightened its hue,
`I wish you had married Ellen, then, if you
think a small foot so very desirable.' Yes I
recollect that perfectly, and it is one of the
occasions I alluded to. She is jealous, as I
told you, not of you, but of my wife's feet!
I exonerate you fully.'
`It amounts to the same thing which she is
jealous of. She plainly envies Ellen! But
it is my fault, as well as yours, too, Harry;
for we have put the idea into her head! I
shouldn't be surprized if it should be
productive
of much misery to her.'
`Indeed, I trust not so serious a result,'
said Harry, with a look of solitude. `But then
women have made themselves wretched, and
their husbands, too, for more trifling matters.
But this occurred four months ago. She has
forgotten it now.'
`Nobut it grows worse. Ellen never
comes to see us, that after she leaves, she
does not have a fit of those delightful little
pouting pantomimes, the
sulks
the whole day.'
`The duece she does! And how does she
treat Ellen?'
`Latterly, with increasing coldness. Have
you not observed it?'
`By Heaven, I have! I heard her at
dinner
,
as I was uncorking a bottle of Port,
reply
to something Ellen said about her going
down to Lane's with her, after dinner, and
get some pairs of shoes, as I thought, in a
very ill-humored way, as I judged, by the
tone; but looking up, and seeing Ellen look
ing as smiling as everwhat a delightful
wife I've got, Linton!I concluded I had
imagined
the ill-humor. But then Ellen is so
sweet tempered, nothing Caroline could say
to her, would move her.'
`One would think you lauded Ellen so
profusely
,
Harry, to show Caroline in a darker
shade! But I hope she will, by-and-by, have
good sense enough to get over it.'
`And I increased the flame to-day, too.
Don't you remember that I was thoughtless
enough, I see now, talking about a pretty
woman
I had met down town, who was faultless,
save her feet, which I said, were not only
large, but that she used them as if a young
lady's feet were absolutely given her merely
to
walk with
, as wheels are put under a
locomotive
,
that it may go somehow over the
ground, instead of being, as Heaven
designed
them, the loveliest features of beauty,
given
her as wings are given angels, to transfer
her person from place to place, revealing, in
the act the harmony and dignity that dwells
in motion!'
`I remember laughing at you, Harry.'
`But your wife didn't laugh!'
`No.'
`No. She looked as grave as a prude.'
`I should have been pleased if she had
only
looked grave. She looked very angry, in
my opinion.'
`Well, I said
grave
, out of respect for your
feelings, Lionel. She did look mad! And I
was struck at the reflection, how ill anger sits
on a pretty face! Evil passions are all ugly,
and the contrast is so great when they
display
thsmselves in a beautiful countenance,
like Mrs. Linton's for instance, that the effect
is singularly unpleasing. On harsh, homely
faces, there is less contrast, and the effect is
less striking. I recollect a beautiful girl of
eighteen, I once saw very angry. She
reminded
me of angel fallen! But I am very
sorry I have said anything to make Caroline
envious of Ellen. Two such friends! What
a sad affair it would be, if this should
dissever
their friendship.'
`I fear it will!' said Linton, gravely; it
were indeed to be regretted. Confound your
mania for pretty feet, Harry!'
`I will say `amen,' if it is to be the cause
of mingling alloy in your cup of connubial
happiness. Caroline is such a lovely and
generous
minded woman, too!'
`Yes, there is only this to mar our felicity.
In all else she is an incomparable creature,
Harry.'
`I will make Ellen wear No. 3's!' said his
friend, warmly.
`No, no! let it work its own cure.'
`But it won't. Let a woman that loves her
husband, once get the idea into her head that
he admires another woman for some point of
character she does not possess, or possessing
less perfection, she will soon believe that his
admiration extends to the whole woman, and
that he loves her better than herself. So ripe
jealousy comes of it; as Dow, Jr. would say
in his very excellent Patent Sermons, `her
thoughts will sit brooding in the nest of
suspicion
,
upon the eggs of envy, till they hatch
the little chickens of jealousy.' These
chickens
must be plucked ere they get full
feathered
.'
`How can it be done, Harry?' asked
Lionel
,
with an interest that called forth his
friend's sympathy.
`Caroline's person and figure are faultless,
and though she wears No. 3's, if she had a
foot for No. 2's, it would be a deformity.
She is full three sizes in person larger than
Ellen, and her foot is not a hair's breadth too
large for her.'
`This I have always said, Harry.'
`And so have I. I said that I would not
marry a woman who wore a number higher
than a French one. I say so now! I
married
such a woman! But I did not say a
woman's foot could not be perfectly beautiful
even with number
fives
. She may be tall
enough, and majestic enough to require such
a foot! How would Mrs. Siddons have
looked
with a foot like Ellen's! absurd and
deformed
!'
`You are changing your tactics, Harry,'
said Linton, laughing.
`Not a shadow! I have always spoken as
I do. I only have always said I liked not a
woman with a large foot; and a woman with
too
large a foot, which is very common, I
cannot endure.'
`What are you coming to, Harry?'
`To this point. Caroline's notions must
be reversed, or, rather, she must have her
ideas on this subject corrected. As I have
been mainly instrumental in giving her such
notions, in which both she and you have
misunderstood
me, I must do my best to make
matters right again.'
`I wish to mercy you would, Harry, if
possible
;
for, to tell you the truth, it is ringing
in my ears from morning 'till night.
`What, does she box them?' asked Harry,
refilling very deliberately his champaign
glass, and looking up with a smile,
`Not quitebut it is almost as bad. The
other morning I happened to knock one of
her shoes aside with my foot, in crossing the
chamber, and she instantly cried, `You'd not
have kicked Ellen Lee's shoe in that way!
It is just because I wear a larger one than
she does, you treat me so;' and so she burst
into tears, got into bed again, and got up at
eleven o'clock with swollen eyes, as silent as
a mule.'
`Well, upon my soul, Linton, I am sorry.
But I have a plan to appeal to her good
sense.'
`What is it? name it, for Heaven's sake.'
`I was in Launitz's gallery last week, and
saw there, as I entered the door, a statue of
Dian, in casque, quiver, and sandal shoon!
I stood still without advancing nearer, and
gazed a long time on the figure, admiring its
just proportions and faultless symmetry;
particulularly
was I fascinated with the foot,
which was as beautiful as Ellen's.'
How is it,' said I, after surveying it
awhile
,
and turning round to the sculptor,
`how is it, Launitz, that every statue of the
mythological beauties is just the size of the
Medician Venus?
This is not,' he said, pointing to the
statue
of the divine huntress. `The Venus
personifies
Love, and is, therefore, small in
staure
,
for grace and love are more
appropriately
and delicately illustrated by lessening the
real. Diana personifies woodland sports
she is the genius of the chase! She is
therefore
some inches taller than the genius of
love, that she may be fleet of foot, and light,
that she may pursue with swiftness! You
observe her feet are slender and larger than
those of the Medici, which is to your left;
and they should be so, to preserve the
poetical
truth of the character.'
`You do not mean to say this statue of
Dian is taller than the Venus de Medici,' I
exclaimed with surprise, approaching it.
`Three inches!' he said, smiling; `its
perfect
symmetry has deceived you!'
`Indeed it has,' said I, as I went close up
to it, when I saw that he had spoken the
truth. Yet the symmetry of person was so
well maintained, that a few steps off, I could
have sworn it was not taller than Ellen, or
the foot larger than her's'
`And yet'
`And yet it was, for I measured it, just the
height of your wife, and the foot half inch
longer than her's!'
`Excellent. And that has conceited you
to the belief that in symmetry may lie the
true principles of beauty, and not in the foot.'
`No, not exactly, but that a foot may be
large, and yet be faultless.'
`Good, my dear Harry, very good! Now
you are getting reasonable'
`Not a jot more so than I have been; for I
yield nothing, concede nothing of what I
have advocated. I have only learnt
something
additional.'
`Well, and how are you going to make
this knowledge avail me in the matter of
Caroline's growing envy.'
`By taking her in to-morrow, as if by
accident
,
in passing by, to see this statue, and
with Launitz's explanation of the true
principles
of beauty as they exist in one and the
other; Dian and Venus, and with a little tact
on my part, and address on your own, we
will make her in perfect good humor with
herself. Nay, I will wager she would
afterwards
turn up her pretty nose at such a little
foot as Ellen's. I will call by at your house,
for you, as I come down from Bond street.'
`You are a clever dog, Harry,' cried
Linton
,
grasping his hand with a brightning eye.
`It shall be as you sayCaroline shall go
to-morrow. I hope this attempt to reconvert
her, will succeed!'
`Never doubt it, Lionel! Come, let us
take a bumper to your lovely Diana!'
`And I will toast your Venus, Harry.'
`Capitalour wives are both Goddesses,
and Dian shall reign in the empire of her
own chaste beauty, as well as Venus in that
of love. Come, Linton, another glass.'
`No, Harry.'
`Well, I will finish this bottle alone, then;
you keep good wine! By-the-by, a friend sent
me a present of a dozen of that fine old
Paulding's Pale we used to drink so much of,
when we were at the hotel. Do you sigh for
those days, Linton.'
`No, Harry, not if I could get Caroline
over this fit of jealousy.'
`Envy, not jealousy, my boy. Don't fear
but all will come out straight. She has been
sighing to be a Venuswe must convince
her she is a goddess, dear! You must come
down and help me to drink up that sherry.
By-the-by, that nice fellow, Sinclair, wrote
me a note he had just received a private
importation
of `Londou Particular,' and wants
me to call at his house, to prove it. I had
like to forgot it. I must quit you, Harry, for
I would not miss Sinclair's wine, for nothing.
Your port is capital! peh, peh! It has a rich
warm flavor like Burgundy. Come to
morrow
,
at eleven. Make my excu-cuse to the
la-ladies, and tell Ellen I'llthat is
you
'll go
home with her. There she is now,
l-loo-looking
l-likel-like a p-p-p-pr-pretty
foo-f-f-f-t
.'
`Why, Harry, you're tipsy,' said Ellen,
coming in at that moment! `Lionel, how
could you let Harry help himself to so much
wine, when you know'
`Y-yesLionel kn-knows, EllenLionel
knows' articulated, or rather stuttered the
very mellow Harry Lee, as he attempted to
cross from the table to the door.
`Where are you going, Harry?' said Ellen,
laughing, as he `vibrated' like an inverted
pendulum, as he tried to walk particularly
upright, and deluded himself with the idea
that he did so.
`I'm going homenoyes, I'm going
home!
'
`To go to bed, I dare say. Harry, why
will you take so much wine, when a very
little
affects you so easily?'
`G-t-t get used to it, EllenI never'll get
used t-t-t-to it, if I don't, don't, don't get used
to it. Did you know
that?
'
`I know you shan't go home, but you shall
lie down on the sofa, here, and take a short
nap, and I will bathe your forehead with
Cologne
.'
`Oh, wo-woman, in our hours of ease.
Uncertain, c-co-coy and hard to please.
B-bu-t when m-mistortune clouds the brow.
A ministering angel, thou!'
Yes, that's dear woman, and
them's
my
sentiments
.'
And thus speaking in an amusingly
drunken
manner, Harry Lee suffered his wife to
lead him to the sofa, where he soon fell
asleep. Lionel drew his chair near Ellen,
as she fanned Harry's heated brow, and
began
to chat with her on the ordinary topics
of the day, when Caroline came in, and
seeing
them so near together, though a chair's
space separated them, she cast an angry
glance at her husband, a revengeful one at
Ellen, and immediately retired, giving the
door a
bang-to
behind her.
`What is the matter with Caroline, to-day?'
anxiously inquired Ellen, unsuspecting her
innocent agency in causing her ill-humor.
`I can't tell youyou must ask Harry,
when he wakes up from his nap,' said Lionel,
with a sad smile, as he rose to follow his
wife, to soothe her; though he ought to have
known ere this, that an angry woman is hest
let alone. Persuasion irritates; anger makes
her worse; humble yourself, and she despises
you; condemn yourself falsely, and she treats
you as if you were really in the fault. If she
loves you, she will soon be sorry and seck
reconciliation; if she does not care for you,
she will get pleased, lest she spoil her
beauty
;
for every pretty woman knows nothing is
so poisonous to the complexion as anger;
nothing destroys beauty so quickly as frowns!
These judicious sayings are taken from an
`Old Booke,' entitled `Sweete Advisement
to Hushands and Wyfes to ye furthurance of
theer Hymeneal amicability.'
Mrs. Linton had retreated to her chamber,
and locked the door! Lionel tried the knob
once or twice, and then spoke in a low tone,
with his mouth to the key-hole.
`Caroline?'
No reply.
`Dear Caroline'a little louder.
No reply.
`Sweetest Caroline, won't you answer?'
No reply.
`Caro, dear, let me in.' A pause.
No reply.
Lionel listened a moment, and then sigh
ing heavily, and wishing all feet, little and
big, to , he turned to go down stairs.
But Mrs. Linton did not intend to let him go
back to Ellen's society; she had quit the
room to make him leave her, as she knew
him well enough to know he would follow
her, if he saw her go out angry. So, as
Lionel
reached the head of the stairs he heard
her door open. He looked back, but she was
not visible, but the door was wide spread.
He returned, and softly entered. Caroline
was seated in a rocking chair, with her back
towards him, rocking very resolutely. He
closed the door and approached her. She
did not turn her head, but kept on rocking
and biting her thumb nail. He knelt on one
knee beside her, and took the hand that lay
on the arm of the chair, but she pulled it
away with a jerk. He sighed heavily, and
after a few seconds' silence, attempted to
take the other, on which she was leaning her
cheek. She snatched it away from him and
kicked the cricket over.
`Caroline, my sweet wife, how have I
offended
you?'
The `sweet wife' bit her nail the harder,
and kept her eyes fixed on vacancy,
`Are you angry because I was talking with
Ellen?'
`
No!
' she replied in a tone so angry, that
it started him; and swinging her chair
smartly
round, she left him at her back.
`What
are
you put out about, then?' he
asked, now almost angry himself.
`Nothing.'
`You are short and sweet. If I have
unintentionally
given you offence, I ask your
forgiveness
,
Caroline,' he said calmly, but
firmly
;
`I can't remain here to see you conduct
yourself in this manner.'
`I suppose not, while Ellen Lee is down
stairs.'
`What is Ellen Lee to me, that I should
desire her society to my dear Caroline's?' he
said, taking her hand, which she instantly
withdrew from him.
Mrs. Linton remained silent, but still
rocking
very perseveringly, and then, at length
replied in that cross and querulous tone, so
difficult to reply to safely, `You like her
because
she has a small foot.'
`Upon my honor, Caroline, you wrong me
I have no thought of any one but you!'
`I
know
you love her! I know what you
think about a wife's foot! You ought to have
looked at my feet before you married me!'
`I wish to gracious I had,' was Lionel's
thought, but he did not speak it aloud. '
see Harry was a more sensible man than I
took him for! Well, Caro, what is to be
done? Are you to be angry all the evening
and expose yourself to Ellen?'
`Ellen, again! Ellenit's all Ellen!'
repeated
the lady, with sneering mockery,
giv-giving
offence to her beautiful features. `I
expect it is with her `Lionel, dear Lionel,
nothing but `Lionel, all the time!
`What has possessed you, Caroline?'
`Nothing more than usual,' she answered,
suddenly changing her manner, ceasing to
rock, and taking up a book began to read it.
She looked as calm and placid as a summer's
morn! He gazed at her with surprize and
perplexity. He had been married, however.
but two years, and this was but a brief
apprenticeship
to a pretty and especially a
jealous
wife's whims. He did not know that this
was but another phase of her displeasure;
but believing she had become pleasant, he
put his arm about her to kiss her, when he
received a slap with the book on the cheek,
that created quite a revolution in his ideas.
Without a word he patiently bore it, and
stood gazing upon her with surprize. If he
had lived all his life a bachelor, he felt it
would not have taught him so much about
woman as he had learned in the last ten
minutes. He was silent and enduring, for
he remembered that she was the `weaker
vessel
,'
and that he had pledged himself to love
and cherish her. He was now practising a
hard lesson in love: for it is a very
hard
one
to love anybody that slaps us angrily in the
face with a book, while the pain is still felt.
Her generosity of spirit should have instantly
done homage to his forbearance; but she was
angry, and that is a great cover for every
thing angered persons do, that is unjust to
be wrapped up in!
Caroline, however, seemed a little
ashamed
,
but shame wouldn't heal her envy and
jealousy.
`Mrs. Linton, you are certainly a very
strange wife!' at length said Lionel, in as
mild a tone as he could assume.
`And you are a very strange husband, Mr.
Linton.'
`What have I done?'
`How innocent, all at once!' and she curled
her lip.
`I
am
innocent of wronging you, Caroline,
in any way.'
`How mild, sir, all at once. How I like to
see a husband mild.'
`What a vexatious person you are! You
curl your lip with such bitterness and scorn
that either you must be a very had woman or
I a very bad man.'
`
There!
you've just hit!'
`Good Heaven! what
has
got into you?
You make yourself the most disagreeable,
hateful woman I ever saw.'
`Yes, yesI am not quite so charming, I
know, as Ellen Lee.'
`Confound Ellen Lee.'
`Ha, ha, ha!' laughed Mrs. Linton,
nervously
rocking back in her chair.
`You are determined to madden memake
me beside myself.'
`Ellen will then restore you to your senses.
I dare say you call and have a
tete-a-tete
with
her every day you go out to walk.'
`Never, Caroline!'
`You have been seen twice walking in
Broadway with her, and did not tell
me
of it.'
`And who has been trying to make
mischief
?
And what harm to walk with her?
Each time I had met her with Harry, who
turned her over to me, pleading engagements
down town.'
`Yes, oh yes!' she said with scornful
incredulity
,
tossing her pretty head. `And you
didn't go in and stay an hour, and no one else
at home! Oh, ho.'
`Upon my soul, I think you ean manage
for so lovely a woman, to make yourself
excessively
disagreeable. Once for all, Mrs.
Linton, are you jealous of my acquaintance
with Harry's wife. If you are, I will speak
to her no more from this hour.'
`Jealous! Ha, ha!
I
jealous of you! No,
no! If I was jealous, I have beauty enough
to make you sick of flirting with other
women
!'
`Do you mean that you will seek the
attentions
of men of gallantry?' he demanded with
astonishment and pain.
`I don't say what I mean or do not mean.
I am not jealous! Jealous! Ha, ha, ha!' and
she rocked away harder than before, and
nearly bit through her fingers' ends to the
blood.
`Will you then be pleasant? You know I
love you,' he said tenderly.
`Not quite so well as Ellen Lee.'
`If you mention that name again, I will
run away from you,' said Lionel, impatiently.
`You are jealous of me, envious of Ellen, and
try to render yourself and me miserable, all
without a shadow of cause.
Caroline became pale at her husband's
stern reproof, and it was plain a little
firmness
on his part would have subdued her
quite.
`Do you not dislike me because I have a
foot longer than Ellen's, Mr. Linton?' she
asked with something less of anger.
`No.'
`Do you not love Ellen for her pretty foot.'
`No.'
`I know you do now, and I know Ellen
tries to contrast herself with me to my
disadvantage
?
She always has her foot out on an
ottoman or cricket! It is always to be seen.'
`Because Harry's vanity makes her wear
her dresses shorter than ordinary, and she'
`Oh, yes, she'll find a defender and
champion
in you, Lionel,' she said with inimitable
scorn.
`I think I had best hold my tongue,' he
said pettishly.
`I think you had,' she repeated with a
bitter
laugh.
We think if he had altogether held his
tongue, it wonld have been altogether best;
for up to this point matters stood as they
were when he came in to the chamberif
any thing, rather worse. At this instant
Harry's voice was heard below stairs, and
Lionel, whose natural goodness of the heart,
and love for his wife would not let him
retain
revenge against her, hastily kissed her
angry cheek, and kindly asking her if she
wouldn't soon come down, left the chamber.
Harry's short nap had restored him to a
degree
of sobriety, and he was ready to leave
to go to his friend Sinclair's wine-proving.
Ellen quickly perceived that something
unpleasant
had occurred between Lionel and
Caroline, and she ordered her carriage,
saying
it would be too late for the baby to be
out if she did not go then. Lionel saw her
and Harry off, and then returned to the
dining
room, hoping Caroline would come down.
But he saw her no more that night, for when
he went to retire, she sent him word that the
nurse was in her room with her for the night,
and that he might go down and sleep on a
sofa in his library, if he chose to. He
sighed
,
and for the first time since his marriage,
tried a bachelor's bed again in the small
front room adjoining the parlor, which he had
made a sort of library and smoking room
having luxuriously furnished it with lounges,
and pillows, and ottomans. Here he took
up his quarters for the night!
`Who wouldn't remain a bachelor if he
knew what it was to be a married man?'
sighed he, as he threw himself upon his
solitary couch. `Yet, if Caroline wasn't
jealous
,
I wouldn't change my state to what it
was, for with all my trouble, I have enjoyed
more real pure happiness the two years I have
been married, than in all my bachelor iife!
Well, he who would have the rose must have
the thorn!'
With this patient reflection, the
bed-banished
husband turned himself over and went
to sleep.
In the meanwhile, Harry and his wife had
reached home, the carriage drove round to
the stables, and taking leave of Ellen on the
steps of his door, he was departing on his
wine-engagement with his friend Sinclair,
when she called him;
`You will go by Lane's Harrywait and
take my gaiter-boots and leave them there.
You can put them in your pocket, you know.'
`Yes, in my vest pocket. What is to be
done to them?'
`The silk is split across the instep, and I
want you to ask him if he can close it again
neatlyif not to cover them with new
fawn-colored
silk.'
`But get a new pair, Ellen.'
`NoI have not worn these three times,
and they are such a pretty shape.'
`So they are! I will take them down Ellen,
if you will give them to me'
His wife after a moment's absence
returned
and placed in his hands a pair of the most
exquisitely shaped French fawn-colored
boots. Harry looked at them almost
adoringly
,
and then examining the rent carefully,
placed them in his coat pocket.
`Now don't lose them out Harry,' she said,
as he walked off in the direction of
Broadway
,
with the toes of the little boots peeping
out of his pocket.
`Oh, noI shall keep them safely, Ellen.'
`Now come home earlyand don't try too
much of Captain Sinclair's `London
Particular
,'
because you know, Harry'
`Yes, I knowI'll be prudent, you may
depend upon me.'
`Call in at Caroline's, when you come up,
as you pass right by the house, and see if
they have got over then little affair.'
`Yes, perhaps I will. Adieu, my fair!'
Harry kissed his hand, and waived his lovely
wife a gallant adieu.
The evening at Captain Sinclair's passed
off pleasantly, and about half past nine,
Harry
left most particularly mellow, to proceed
home on footfor he loved walking in
preference
to the omnibus-creeping
dot-and-go-one
pace. As he passed the head of Murray
street, he recollected that he had forgotten
to leave Ellen's boots in coming down, and
immediately turned and went into Lane's
fashionable ladies' shoe mart.
`Ah, eh! Lane, good evening,' he said
tipsily
and pleasantly; `here's a pair of Mrs.
Lee's gaiter bootssplit out, you seeEllen
wants them sewed.' And Harry taking them
from his pocket gave them to him.
`Yes, I see, sir,' said Lane examining the
rent and shaking his head; `but I fear it
can't be done.'
`It must be donemust, must be, be
d-done
Lane,' said Harry, keeping himself
steady with his hand on the back of a chair.
`It will cost quite as much as a new pair
of boots, to repair itthe whole silk must be
taken offthe welts made newit will be
quite as much work as to make a new boot,
Mr. Lee. In fact, I would rather make a
new pair.'
`Develish bad, Lane! Ellen's favorite
boots! Mine too! Small foot my wife has,
eh, Lane?'
`The prettiest boots I ever made, sir,' said
Lane, admiring them. `I would know her
shoe or boot if I saw it anywhere.'
`So you wouldso anybody would. Lane,
you're a man of sentimentof talk, I mean.
But you can't mend 'em, eh?'
`I am sorry to say no, sir.'
`Well, I'll take them along with me, and
try some other shoe storeperhaps some on
'em may find a way of fixing 'em.'
`Perhaps so, Mr. Lee; but I advise you to
have a new pairthey are quite useless to
you.'
`Are they, Lane?then I'll take them and
give 'em to some little poor child in the
street. 'Tis a pity to lose 'em; such, such
a p-pr-pret-ty
fool!
' and Harry recovering
himself from a slight `vibration,' held up the
boots to his own admiring eyes.
He then put them in his pocket, and
walked
as erect as a granadier, from the shoe
storetipsy gentlemen always walk
particularly
erect,
if they can!
Notwithstanding Lane's judgment passed
upon the boots, Harry took them into
Whittington's
and one or two other places, where
he found condemnation passed upon them
equally strong as at Lane's. He therefore
became a little irritated, and was half of a
mind to throw them into the street. While
in this mood of temper, and yet holding them
in his hand, he came opposite Linton's house.
He remembered Ellen's request for him to
call; but looking up at the house and seeing
no lights, he concluded not to do so, and was
about passing on, when he saw that the
window
of Lionel's library, where he was
sleeping
on the ottoman, was let down at the top,
for the night was warm and close.
Thereupon
a thought struck him, and turning back
a step, he tossed Ellen's hapless boots thro'
into the room, and went on his way whistling,
with an occasional hiccup for a second,
`Wha'll be king but Charlie. oh,
Wha'll be king but Charlie?'
The ensuing morning, Mrs. Caroline
Linton
awoke, and lay reflecting upon all her
conduct to Lionel. Her conscience
convicted
her of injustice towards him, and she
resolved
she would make him unhappy no
longer by her jealousy. A night's sleep and
the subsequent morning's reflections, often
produce great changes in the minds both of
men and women. Caroline felt she had been
wrong, and herein her good sense had the
ascendency.
`I will go down to the library, and while
he is asleep kiss him, wake him, and ask his
forgiveness for my folly, and I will be jealous
and envious no longerfor I know he loves
me with all his noble and manly heart.'
With this sensible and very praiseworthy
resolution, she rose, threw on her snowy robe
de chambre
, and stole softly down stairs. All
was still in the halls, and she timidly
approached
the door of the library. It was
partly
open, and she entered. Her husband lay
asleep on the ottoman, in his dressing gown.
She bent over him, and then lightly kissed
his forehead! The touch, slight as it was,
awakened him, and looking up he smiled upon
hor with a calm joy that he could not give
utterance to, and folded her to his heart.
`You have slept badly here, I fear, Lionel,'
she said, after a few moments' silence between
them, during which he held her hand
affectingly
and happily in his.
`Pretty well, wifeI have, however, been
a long while unfamiliar with a bachelor's
lodgings,' he said smiling.
`Forgive me, Lionel! I have acted very
foolishly. Won't you forgive me?'
`With all my heart.'
`If you will, I will never mention Ellen to
you again.'
`Nor doubt my love for you?'
`No, never again, husband. I know you
don't think of Ellen, except as my friend and
as Harry's wife.'
`You do me but justice, dear Caroline,' he
said tenderly.
`And I promise you I will never be jealous
of you and Ellen a' here she checked
herself
,
uttered a shriek, and springing forward,
caught up one of Ellen's boots which lay at
the end of the sofa. Oh, what mischief
Harry
set on foot.
`Good God! what is all this! cried Lionel,
seizing his wife by the arm, not seeing the
cause of her shrick.
`What is it, Mr. Innocence? Look at this!
whose boot is this, sir?' and she held up the
hapless gaiter-boot to Lionel's astonished
eyes.
`It looks like Ellen's,' he said with
surprise
.
`
Looks
like Ellen's! You know it is her's;
and now tell me how it came here?'
`Upon my soul, I am ignorant as the babe
unborn.'
`You
do
know. A lady's boot in your
sleeping-room and you innocent of all
knowledge
of it!'
`It may have been thrown into the library
door, yesterday, by her nurse. If there were
a pair of them found, your suspicions might
have some foundation!' pleaded Lionel in the
most unlucky sentence a man ever uttered.
`Then,' she shrieked, her searching and
jealous eyes having discovered the toe of the
other peeping from beneath the sofa, `then
you have condemned yourself out of your
own mouth, Sir! Look at this, too!' and she
held up the mate to the eye of the astounded
husband. Lionel gazed upon it as if it had
been a basalisk.
`Well, Sir,' demanded the infuriated wife,
her eyes flashing, her cheek pale, and her
whole form heaving with anger, wounded
pride, and violent jealousy.
`By mine honor, Caroline, I know nothing
about it.'
`You doyou
do
, Mr. Linton! Where is
shewhere is the wicked thing concealed?'
And Mrs. Linton flew to the window
curtains
,
and examined their foldslifted the
drapery before a book case, got down on the
floor and looked under the sofas and ottomans
peeped behind the door, and then taking
breath, came and thrust the fatal boots once
more in poor Lionel's face.'
`Oh, you villain!' she cried nervously, and
with terrific emotion shaking her whole frame,
`you will be the death of me! You will, you
will!' and overcome by the intensity and
excess
of her feelings, she shrieked, and fell
fainting into the arms of her grieved,
wondering
,
alarmed and puzzled husband.
`Mrs. Linton was conveyed to her
chamber
,
a servant despatched for a physician, and
another for Harry and his wife. These
parties
all arrived about the same time, and
Lionel taking Harry aside, privately
communicated
the whole matter to him. He was
listened to very gravely by his friend, who,
when he had concluded, gave himself freely
up to the merriest fit of laughter, he had ever
indulged in. When, at length, Lionel could
make him speak, he explained to him how
the boots came in his room.
`Come, for heaven's sake, to Caroline's
room with me,' cried Lionel, dragging him
by the arms; `she is calmer now. You have
almost been my ruin; you snall now save
me.'
Harry went into the chamber where
Caroline
lay, with her arm bound up, for she had
just been bled for a determination of blood
to the brain. She had fiercely forbidden
Ellen
to come near her, and when Lionel
entered
,
she shrieked, and called him her murderer.
Harry, however, succeeded in calming her
sufficiently to listen to him, when he
explained
in his humorous and happy way, the
adventure of the boots. Caroline listened at
first with incredulity; but as Harry
concluded
,
she felt convinced of the truth of his
account
,
especially when she called to mind that
he had as much cause for jealousy about the
introduction of the boots into Lionel's
sleeping
room, as herself. After a few moment's
reflection, with her hands covering her face,
she looked up with a sweet smile and silently
extended one hand to Lionel, the other to
Ellenthe one pressed her to his grateful
heart, the other affectionately kissed her
cheek, and a full and perfect reconcilliation
was ratified and sealed.
`I will never be jealous again, Lionel, be
circumstances ever so strong against you; I
feel I have been very silly, and made you and
Ellen very unhappy. I hope you will both
forgive me.'
`And am I to be forgiven?' asked Harry,
taking her hand, `for making so much
mischief
?'
`Freely, since you have so well repaired the
mischief you have done,' she said gaily; `but
I hope you will be careful never to throw a
lady's boots, particularly your wife's, into a
gentleman's window again!'
It will be well to mention that the visit to the
statue of Diana at Launitz's studio, was made,
and that the result was most happy on the
mind of the beautiful and Diana-like Mrs.
Linton; who, from that moment, was no more
jealous of Ellen's small foot, being perfectly
satisfied that a lady may wear number three's
and yet have as beautiful and symmetrical
feet as one who wears number one French
gaiter boots.
