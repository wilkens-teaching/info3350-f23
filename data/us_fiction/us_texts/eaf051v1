PRECAUTION.
CHAPTER I.
I wonder
if we are to have a
neighbour
in the Deanery soon, inquired Clara
Moseley, addressing herself to a small party,
assembled in her father's drawing room,
while standing at a window which
commanded
a distant view of the mansion in
question.
Oh yes, replied her brother, the
agent has let it to a Mr. Jarvis for a
couple
of years, and he is to take possession
this week.
And who is the Mr. Jarvis that is about
to become so near a neighbour to us? asked
Sir Edward Moseley of his son.
Why, Sir, I learn he has been a capital
merchant, that has retired from business
with a large fortune; that he has, like
yourself
,
sir, an only hope for his declining years
in his son, who is an officer in the army;
and, moreover, that he has a couple of fine
daughters; so, sir, he is a man of family,
you see. But, dropping his voice, whether
he is a man of family in your sense, Jane,
looking at his second sister, is more than
I could discover.
I hope you did not take the trouble, sir,
to inquire on my account, retorted Jane,
colouring slightly with vexation at his
speech.
Yes, but indeed I did, my dear sis, and
solely on your account, replied the
laughing
brother, for you well know, that no
gentility, no husband; and it's dull work to
you young ladies without at least a
possibility
of matrimony; as for Clara, she is
Here he was stopped by his youngest
sister Emily placing her hand on his mouth,
as she whispered in his ear, John, you
forget the anxiety of a certain gentleman,
about a fair incognita at Bath, and a list of
inquiries concerning her lineage, and a few
other indispensables. John, in his turn,
coloured, and affectionately kissing the hand
which kept him silent, addressed himself to
Jane, and by his vivacity and good humour
soon restored her complacency.
I rejoice, said Lady Moseley, that Sir
William has found a tenant, however; for
next to occupying it himself, it is a most
desirable
thing to have a good tenant in it, on
account of the circle we live in.
And Mr. Jarvis has the great goodness
of money, by John's account, dryly
observed
Mrs. Wilson, a sister of Sir
Edward's
.
Let me tell you, madam, cried the
rector
of the parish, looking around him
pleasantly
,
that a great deal of money is a very
good thing in itself, and that a great many
very good things may be done with it.
Such as paying tythes, ha! doctor,
cried Mr. Haughton, a gentleman of landed
property in the neighbourhood, of plain
exterior
,
but great goodness of heart, and
between
whom and the rector subsisted the
most cordial good will.
Aye, tythes, or halves, as the baronet
did here, when he forgave old Gregson one
half his rent, and his children the other.
Well, but my dear, said Sir Edward to
his wife, you must not starve our friends
because we are to have a neighbour.
William
has stood with the dining room door
open these five minutes
Lady Moseley gave her hand to the rector,
and the company followed them, without any
order, to the dinner table.
The party assembled on this day round
the hospitable board of the baronet, was
composed, beside the before-mentioned
persons
,
of a wife of Mr. Haughton, a woman
of much good sense and modesty of
deportment
;
their daughter, a young lady
conspicuous
for nothing but good nature; and the
wife and son of the rectorthe latter but
lately admitted into holy orders himself.
The remainder of the day was passed in
that uninterrupted flow of pleasant
conversation
which was the natural consequence
of a unison of opinions in all leading
questions
,
and where the parties had long known
and esteemed each other for those qualities
which soonest reconcile us to the common
frailties of our nature. On parting at the
usual hour, it was agreed to meet that day
week at the rectory, and the doctor, on
making his bow to Lady Moseley, observed,
that he intended, in virtue of his office, to
make an early call on the Jarvis family, and
that, if possible, he would persuade them to
join the intended party at his house.
Sir Edward Moseley was descended from
one of the most respectable of the creations
of his order by James, and had inherited,
with many of the virtues of his ancestors,
an estate which placed him amongst the
greatest landed proprietors in the county.
But, as it had been an invariable rule never
to deduct a single acre from the inheritance
of the eldest son, and the extravagance of
his mother, who was the daughter of a
nobleman, had much embarrassed the affairs
of his father, Sir Edward, on coming into
possession of his estate, had wisely
determined
to withdraw from the gay world, by
renting his house in town, and retiring
altogether
to his respectable mansion, about a
hundred miles from the metropolis. Here
he hoped, by a course of systematic, but
liberal economy, to release himself from all
embarrassments, and make such a provision
1*
for his younger children, the three daughters
already mentioned, as he conceived their
birth entitled them to expect. Seventeen
years had enabled him to accomplish this
plan; and for more than eighteen months
Sir Edward had resumed the hospitality and
appearance usual in his family, and had
even promised his delighted girls to take
possession the ensuing winter, of his house
in St. James's Square. Nature had not
qualified
Sir Edward for great or continued
exertions, and the prudent decision he had
taken to retrieve his fortunes, was perhaps
an act of as much forecast and vigour as his
talents or energy would admit of; it was the
step most obviously for his interests, and
safest both in its execution and consequences,
and as such had been adopted: but, had it
required a single particle more of enterprise
or calculation, it would have been beyond
his powers, and the heir might have yet
laboured
under the difficulties which
distressed
his more brilliant, but less prudent
parent
.
The baronet was warmly attached to his
wife; and as she was a woman of many
valuable
and no obnoxious qualities, civil and
attentive by habit to all around her, and
perfectly
disinterested in her attachments to her
own family, nothing in nature could partake
more of perfection in the eyes of her husband
and children than the conduct of this beloved
relative; yet Lady Moseley had her failings,
although few were disposed to view her
errors with that severity which truth
requires
,
and a just discrimination of character
renders necessary. Her union had been one
of love, and for a time, objected to by the
friends of her husband, on the score of
fortune
;
but constancy and perseverance had
prevailed, and the protracted and
inconsequent
opposition of his parents, had left no
other effects, than an aversion in their
children
to the exercise or even influence of
parental
authority, in marrying their own
descendants
,
which, although equal in degree,
was somewhat differing in effect. In the
husband it was quiescent; but in the wife,
slightly shaded with the female esprit du
corps, of having her daughters comfortably
established, and that in due season. Lady
Moseley was religious, but hardly pious;
she was charitable in deeds; but not always
in opinions; her intentions were pure, but
neither her prejudices or her reasoning
powers
suffered her to be at all times consistent;
yet few knew her but loved her, and none
were ever heard to say aught against her
breeding, her morals, or her disposition.
The sister of Sir Edward had been
married
,
early in life, to an officer in the army,
who, spending much of his time abroad on
service, had left her a prey to that solicitude
to which her attachment to her husband
necessarily
exposed her; to find relief from
which, an invaluable friend had pointed out
the only true course her case admitted ofa
research into her own heart, and the
employment
of active benevolence. The death of
her husband, who lost his life in battle,
causing her to withdraw in a great measure
from the world, gave her time for, and
induced
those reflections, which led to
impressions
on the subject of religion, correct in
themselves, and indispensable as the basis of
future happiness, but slightly tinctured with
the sternness of her vigorous mind, and
possibly
at times more unbending than was
compatible with the comforts of this world;
a fault, however, of manner, and not of
matter
.
Warmly attached to her brother and his
children, Mrs. Wilson, who had never been
a mother herself, had yielded to their earnest
entreaties to become one of the family; and
although left by the late General Wilson
with a large income, she had since his death
given up her establishment, and devoted most
of her time to the formation of the character
of her youngest niece. Lady Moseley had
submitted this child entirely to the control
of her aunt; and it was commonly thought
Emily would inherit the very handsome sum
left to the disposal of the General's widow.
Both Sir Edward and Lady Moseley had
possessed a large share of personal beauty
when young, and it had descended in
common
to all their children, but more
particularly
to the youngest daughters. Although
a strong family resemblance, both in person
and character, existed between these closely
connected relatives, yet it existed with shades
of distinction, that had very different effects
on their conduct, and led to results which
stamped their lives with widely differing
degrees
of happiness.
Between the families at Moseley Hall and
the Rectory, there had existed for many
years an intimacy, founded on esteem, and
on long intercourse. Doctor Ives was a
clergyman of deep piety, and very
considerable
talents; he possessed, in addition to a
moderate benefice, an independent fortune in
right of his wife, who was the only child of
a distinguished naval officer. Both were
well connected, well bred, and well disposed
to their fellow creatures. They were blessed
with but one childthe young divine we
have mentioned, who promised to equal his
father in all those qualities which had made
the Doctor the delight of his friends, and
almost the idol of his parishioners.
Between Francis Ives and Clara Moseley,
there had been an attachment, which had
grown with their years, from their childhood.
He had been her companion in their
youthful
recreationshad espoused her little
quarrels
,
and participated in her innocent
pleasures
,
for so many years, and with such
evident preference for each other in the
youthful pairthat on leaving college to
enter on the studies of his sacred calling
with his father, Francis here rightly judged,
that none other would make his future life
so happy, as the mildness, the tenderness,
the unassuming worth of the retiring Clara.
Their passion, if so gentle a feeling could
deserve the term, had received the sanction
of their parents, and waited only the
establishment
of the youthful divine, to perfect
their union.
The retirement of Sir Edward's family
had been uniform, with the exception of
occasional visits to an aged uncle of his
wife's, and who, in return, spent much of
his time with them at the Hall, and who
had declared his intention of making the
children of Lady Moseley his heirs. The
visits of Mr. Benfield were always hailed
as calling for more than ordinary gayety;
for although rough from indulgence in his
manner, and somewhat infirm from his
years, the old bachelor, who was rather
addicted
to those customs he had indulged in
in his youth, and was fond of dwelling on
the scenes of former days, was
universally
beloved where he was intimately
known, for his unbounded, though at times,
singular philanthropy.
The illness of the mother-in-law of Mrs.
Wilson had called her to Bath the winter
preceding the spring our history commences,
and she had been accompanied by her nephew
and favourite niece. John and Emily,
during
the month of their residence in that city,
were in the practice of making daily
excursions
in its environs; and it was in one of
these little tours that they were of
accidental
service to a very young and very
beautiful
woman, apparently in low health. They
had taken her up in their carriage, and
conveyed her to a farm-house where she
resided, during a faintness which had come
over her in a walk; and her beauty, air, and
manner, altogether so different from those
around her, had interested them both to a
painful degree. They had ventured to call
the following day to inquire after her
welfare
,
and this led to a slight intercourse,
which continued for the fortnight longer
they remained there.
John had given himself some trouble to
ascertain who she was, but in vain. All they
could learn was, that her life was
blameless
,
she saw no one but themselves, and
her dialect raised a suspicion she was not
English. To this then it was that Emily had
alluded in her playful attempt to stop the
heedless rattle of her brother, which was not
always restrained by a proper regard for the
feelings of others.
CHAPTER II.
On
the morning succeeding the day of
the dinner at the Hall, Mrs. Wilson, and
all her nieces and her nephew, availed
themselves
of the fineness of the weather, to walk
to the Rectory, whither they were in the
frequent habit of such informal and friendly
visits. They had just cleared the little
village
of B, which lay in their route, as a
rather handsome travelling carriage and four
passed them, and took the road which led to
the Deanery.
As I live, cried John, there go our
new neighbours, the Jarvis's; yes, yes, that
must be the old merchant muffled up in the
corner, which I mistook at first for a pile of
band-boxes; then the rosy-cheek'd lady,
with so many feathers, must be the old
ladyheaven forgive me, Mrs. Jarvis I mean
ay, and the two others the belles.
You are in a hurry to pronounce them
belles, John, cried Jane; it would be
well to see more of them, before you speak
so decidedly.
Oh! replied John, I have seen
enough
of them, andhe was interrupted
by the whirling of a tilbury and tandem,
followed by a couple of servants on
horse-back
.
All about this vehicle and its
masters
,
bore the stamp of decided fashion, and
our party had followed it with their eyes for
a short distance, when having reached a
fork in the roads, it stopped, and evidently
waited the coming up of the pedestrians, as
if to make an inquiry. A single glance of
the eye was sufficient to apprise the
gentleman
on the low cushion of the kind of
people he had to deal with, and stepping
from his carriage, he met them with a
graceful bow, and after handsomely
apologising
for troubling them, he desired to know
which road led to the Deanery. The
right, sir, replied John, returning his
salutation
.
Ask them, Colonel, cried the
charioteer
,
whether the old gentleman went
right or not.
The Colonel, in the manner of a perfect
gentleman, but with a look of compassion
for his companion's want of tact, made the
desired inquiry; which being satisfactorily
answered, he again bowed, and was
retiring
,
as one of several pointers who
followed
the cavalcade sprang upon Jane, and
soiled her walking dress with his dirty feet.
Come hither, Dido, cried the Colonel,
as he hastened to beat the dog back from
the young lady; and again he apologised in
the same collected and handsome manner
when turning to one of the servants, he said,
call in the dog, sir, and rejoined his
companion
.
The air of this gentleman was
peculiarly
pleasant; he was decidedly
military
,
VOL. I. 2
had he not been addressed as such by his
younger and certainly less polished
companion
.
The Colonel was apparently about
thirty, and of extremely handsome face and
figure, while his driving friend appeared
several years younger, and of different
materials
altogether.
I wonder, said Jane, as they turned a
corner which hid them from view, who
they are? Who they are? cried her
brother
,
why the Jarvis's to be sure; did'nt
you hear them ask the road to the Deanery?
Oh! the one that drove,
he
may be a
Jarvis, but not the gentleman who spoke to
ussurely not, John; he was called Colonel
you know.
Yes, yes, said John, with one of his
quizzing expressions, Colonel Jarvis, that
must be the alderman; they are commonly
colonels of city volunteers: yes, that must
have been the old gentleman who spoke to
us, and I was right about the band-boxes.
You forget, said Clara, with a smile,
the polite inquiry concerning the old
gentleman
.
Ah! true; who can this Colonel be then,
for young Jarvis is only a captain I know;
who do you think he is, Jane?
How do you think I can tell you, John;
but whoever he is, he owns the tilbury,
although
he did not drive it, and he is a
gentleman
both by birth and manners.
Why, Jane, if you know so much, you
might know more, but it is all guess with
you.
No, it is not guessI am sure of it.
The aunt and sisters, who had taken little
interest in the dialogue, looked at her with
some surprise, which John observing, he
exclaimed
,
Poh: she knows no more than we
all know. Indeed I do. Poh, poh,
continued her brother, if you know, tell.
Why, the arms were different, then.
John laughed as he said, that
is
a good
reason, to be sure, for the tilbury being the
colonel's property; but now for his blood;
how did you discover that, sis, by his gait
and movements?
Jane coloured a little, and laugh'd faintly,
as she said, the arms on the tilbury had
six quarterings. Emily now laughed, and
Mrs. Wilson and Clara smiled, while John
continued his teazing until they reached the
rectory.
While chatting with the doctor and his wife,
Francis returned from his morning ride, and
told them the Jarvis family had arrived; he
had witnessed an unpleasant accident to a
gig, in which were Captain Jarvis, and a
friend, Colonel Egerton; it had been
awkwardly
driven in turning in the deanery gate,
and upset: the colonel received some injury
to his ancle, nothing, however, serious he
hoped, but such as to put him under the care
of the young ladies probably for a few days.
After the usual exclamations which follow
such details, Jane ventured to inquire of the
young divine who Colonel Egerton was:
Why, I understood at the time from one of
the servants, that he is a nephew of Sir
Edgar
Egerton, and a lieutenant-colonel on
half-pay
or furlough, or some such thing.
How did he bear his misfortune, Mr.
Francis? inquired Mrs. Wilson.
Certainly as a gentleman, madam, if not
as a Christian, replied the young clergyman,
smiling; indeed, most men of gallantry
would, I believe, rejoice in an accident which
drew forth so much sympathy, as the Miss
Jarvis's manifested.
How fortunate you should all happen to
be near, said Clara, compassionately.
Are the young ladies pretty? asked
Jane, with something of hesitation in her
manner.
Why, I rather think they are; but I took
very little notice of their appearance, as the
colonel was really in evident pain.
This, then, cried the doctor, affords
me an additional excuse for calling on them
at an early day, so I'll e'en go to-morrow.
I trust Doctor Ives wants no apologies
for performing his duty, said Mrs. Wilson.
He is fond of making them, though, said
Mrs. Ives, speaking with a benevolent smile,
and for the first time in the little
conversation
.
It was then arranged that the rector should
make his official visit, as intended, by himself;
and on his report, the ladies would act; and
after remaining at the rectory an hour, they
returned to the hall, attended by Francis.
The next day the doctor drove in, and
informed
them the Jarvis family were happily
settled, and the colonel in no danger,
excepting
from the fascinations of the damsels, who
took such evident care of him, that he
wanted
for nothing, and they might drive over
whenever they pleased, without fear of
intruding
unseasonably.
Mr. Jarvis received his guests with the
frankness of good feelings, if not with the
polish of high life; while his wife, who
seldom
thought of the former, would have been
mortally offended with the person who could
have suggested that she omitted any of the
elegancies of the latter. Her daughters were
rather pretty, but wanted, both in appearance
and manner, the inexpressible air of
haut ton,
which so eminently distinguished the easy
but polished deportment of Colonel Egerton,
who they found reclining on a sofa with his leg
in a chair, amply secured in numerous
bandages
,
but unable to rise; yet,
notwithstanding
the awkwardness of his situation, he was
by far the least discomposed person of the
party, and having pleasantly excused his
dishabille to the ladies, appeared to think no
more of his accident or its effects.
The captain, Mrs. Jarvis remarked, had
gone out with his dogs to try the grounds
around them, for he seems to live only with
2*
his horses and his gun: young men, my lady,
now-a-days, appear to forget that there are
any things in the world but themselves; now
I told Harry that your ladyship and
daughters
would favour us with a call this
morning
but
no: there he went as if Mr. Jarvis
was unable to buy us a dinner, and we should
all starve but for his quails and pheasants.
Quails and pheasants, cried John, in
consternation, does Captain Jarvis shoot
quails and pheasants at this time of the year?
Mrs. Jarvis, sir, said Colonel Egerton,
with a correcting smile, understands the
allegiance due from us gentlemen to the
ladies
,
better than the rules of sporting; my
friend, the captain, has taken his fishing rod
I believe, madam.
It is all one, fish or birds, cried Mrs.
Jarvis, he is out of the way when he is
wanted most, and I believe we can buy fish
as easily as birds; I wish he would pattern
after yourself, colonel, in these matters.
Colonel Egerton laughed pleasantly, but
did not blush at this open compliment to his
manners, and Miss Jarvis observed, with a
look of something like admiration thrown on
his reclining figure, that when Harry had
been in the army as long as his friend, he
would know the usages of good society, she
hoped, as well.
Yes, said her mother, the army is
certainly the place to polish a young man;
and turning to Mrs. Wilson, your husband,
I believe, was in the army, ma'am?
I hope, said Emily hastily, that we
shall have the pleasure of seeing you soon,
Miss Jarvis, at the Hall, and preventing the
necessity of a reply from her aunt; the
young lady promised to be early in her visit,
and the subject changed to a general and
uninteresting
discourse on the neighbourhood,
country, weather, and other ordinary topics.
Now, John, cried Jane in triumph, as
they drove from the door, you must
acknowledge
my heraldic witchcraft, as you are
pleased to call it, is right for once at least.
Oh! no doubt, Jenny, said John, who
was accustomed to use that appellation to
her as a provocation, when he wished what
he called an enlivening spirt; but Mrs.
Wilson
put a stop to it by a remark to his mother,
and the habitual respect of both the
combatants
kept them silent.
Jane Moseley was endowed by nature with
an excellent understanding, at least equal to
that of her brother, but wanted the more
essential
requisites of a well governed mind.
Masters had been provided by Sir Edward
for all his daughters, and if they were not
acquainted
with the usual acquirements of
young women in their rank in life, it was not
his fault: his system of economy had not
embraced
a denial of opportunity to any of his
children, and the baronet was apt to think
all
was
done, when they were put where all
might
be done. Feeling herself and parents
entitled to enter into all the gayeties and
splendour of some of the richer families in
their vicinity, Jane, who had grown up
during
the temporary eclipse of Sir Edward's
fortunes, had sought that self-consolation so
common to people in her situation, which
was to be found in reviewing the former
grandeur of her house, and had thus
contracted
a degree of family pride. If Clara's
weaknesses
were less striking than those of Jane,
it was because she had less imagination, and
because that in loving Francis Ives she had
so long admired a character, where so little
was to be found that could be censured, that
she might be said to have contracted a habit
of judging correctly, without being able at
all times to give a reason for her conduct or
opinions.
CHAPTER III.
The
day fixed for one of the stated visits
of Mr. Benfield had now arrived, and John,
with Emily, who was the old bachelor's
favourite
niece, went in the baronet's post
chaise to the town of F, a distance of
twenty miles, to meet him, and convey him
the remainder of his journey to the Hall, it
being a settled rule with the old man, that his
carriage horses should return to their own
stables every night, where he conceited they
could alone find that comfort and care, their
age and services gave them a claim to. The
day was uncommonly pleasant, and the young
people in high spirits, with the expectation
of meeting their respected relative, whose
absence had been prolonged a few days by a
severe fit of the gout.
Now, Emily, cried John, as he fixed
himself comfortably by the side of his sister
in the chaise, let me know honestly, how
you like the Jarvis's and the handsome
colonel
.
Then, John, honestly, I neither like nor
dislike the Jarvis's or the handsome colonel,
if you must know.
Well, then, there is no great diversity in
our sentiments, as Jane would say.
John!
Emily!
I do not like to hear you speak so
disrespectfully
of our sister, and one I am sure
you love as tenderly as myself.
I acknowledge my error, said the
brother
,
taking her hand affectionately, and
will endeavour to offend no more; but this
Colonel Egerton, sister, he is certainly a
gentleman
,
both by blood and in manners, as
JaneEmily interrupted him with a laugh
at his forgetfulness, which John took very
good-naturedly, as he repeated his
observation
without alluding to their sister.
Yes, said Emily, he is genteel in his
deportment, if that be what you mean; I
know nothing of his family.
Oh, I have taken a peep into Jane's
Baronetage
,
and I find him set down there as Sir
Edgar's heir.
There is something about him, said
Emily, musing, that I do not much admire;
he is too easythere is no nature; I always
feel afraid such people will laugh at me as
soon as my back is turned, and for those very
things they seem most to admire to my face.
If I might be allowed to judge, I should say
his manner wants one thing, without which
no one can be truly agreeable.
What's that?
Sincerity.
Ah! that's my great recommendation,
cried John, with a laugh; but I am afraid I
shall have to take the poacher up, with his
quails and his pheasants indeed.
You know the colonel explained that to
be a mistake.
What they call explaining away; but
unluckily
I saw the gentleman returning with
his gun on his shoulder, and followed by a
brace of pointers.
There's a specimen of the colonel's
manners
then, said Emily, with a smile; it will
do until the truth be known.
And Jane, cried her brother, when
she saw him also, praised his good nature
and consideration, in what she was pleased to
call, relieving the awkwardness of my
remark
.
Emily finding her brother disposed to dwell
on the foibles of Jane, a thing at times he
was rather addicted to, was silent; and they
rode some distance before John, who was
ever as ready to atone as he was to offend,
again apologised, again promised
reformation
,
and during the remainder of the ride,
only forgot himself twice more in the same
way.
They reached Ftwo hours before the
lumbering coach of their uncle drove into the
yard of the inn, and had sufficient time to
refresh their own horses for the journey
homeward.
Mr. Benfield was a bachelor of eighty, but
retained the personal activity of a man of
sixty. He was strongly attached to all the
fashions and opinions of his youth, during
which he had sat one term in parliament, and
had been a great beau and courtier in the
commencement of the reign. A
disappointment
in an affair of the heart, had driven him
into retirement, and for the last fifty years,
he had dwelt exclusively at a seat he owned
within forty miles of Moseley Hall, the
mistress
of which was the only child of his only
brother. In his figure, he was tall and spare,
very erect for his years, and he faithfully
preserved in his attire, servants, carriages,
and indeed every thing around him, as much
of the fashions of his youth, as
circumstances
would admit of: such then was a
faint outline of the character and appearance
of the old man, who, dressed in a cocked
hat, bag wig and sword, took the offered arm
of John Moseley to alight from his coach.
So, cried the old gentleman, having
made good his footing on the ground, as he
stopped short and stared John in the face,
you have made out to come twenty miles
to meet an old cynic, have you, sir; but I
thought I bid you bring Emmy with you.
John pointed to the window, where his
sister stood anxiously watching her uncle's
movements. On catching her eye, he smiled
kindly, as he pursued his way into the house,
talking to himself.
Ay, there she is indeed; I remember
now, when I was a youngster, of going with
my kinsman, old Lord Gosford, to meet his
sister, the Lady Juliana, when she first came
from school, (this was the lady whose
infidelity
had driven him from the world;) and a
beauty she was indeed, something like Emmy
there, only she was taller, and her eyes were
black, and her hair too, that was black, and
she was not so fair as Emmy, and she was
fatter, and she stooped a littlevery little;
oh! they are wonderfully alike though; don't
you think they were, nephew? as he stopped
at the door of the room; while John, who in
this description could not see a resemblance,
which existed no where but in the old man's
affections, was fain to say, yes; but they
were related, you know, uncle, and that
explains
the likeness.
True boy, true, said his uncle, pleased
at a reason for a thing he wished, and which
flattered his propensities; for he had once
before
told Emily she put him in mind of his
housekeeper, a woman as old as himself, and
without a tooth in her head.
On meeting his niece, Mr. Benfield, (who,
like many others that feel strongly, wore in
common the affectation of indifference and
displeasure
,)
yielded to his fondness, and folding
her in his arms, kissed her affectionately as a
tear glistened in his eye; and then pushing her
gently from him, he exclaimed, come, come,
Emmy, don't strangle me, don't strangle me,
girl; let me live in peace the little while I
have to remain hereso, seating himself
composedly in an arm chair his niece had
placed for him with a cushion, so, Anne
writes me, Sir William Harris has let the
VOL. I. 3
deanery. O yes, uncle, cried John. I'll
thank you, young gentleman, said Mr.
Benfield
sternly, not to interrupt me when I
am speaking to a lady; that is, if you please,
sir: then Sir William has let the deanery to
a London merchant, a Mr. Jarvis; now, I
knew three people of that nameone was a
hackney coachman when I was a member of
the parliament of this realm, and drove me
often to the house; the other was
valet-de-chambre
to my Lord Gosford; and the third,
I take it, is the very man who has become
your neighbour. If it be the person I mean,
Emmy dear, he is likelikeay, very like
old Peter, my steward. John, unable to
contain
his mirth at this discovery of a likeness
between the prototype of Mr. Benfield
himself
in leanness of figure, and the jolly
rotundity
of the merchant, was obliged to leave
the room; while Emily, smiling at the
comparison
,
said, you will meet him to-morrow,
dear uncle, and then you will be able to
judge for yourself.
Yes, yes, muttered the old man to
himself
,
very like old Peter; as like as two
peas; and the parallel was by no means as
ridiculous as might be supposed.
Mr. Benfield had placed twenty thousand
pounds in the hands of a broker, with
positive
orders for him to pay it away
immediately
for government stock, bought by the
former on his account; but disregarding this
injunction, the broker had managed the
transaction
in such a way, as to postpone the
payment, until, on his failure, he had given up
that and a much larger sum to Mr. Jarvis, to
satisfy what he called an honorary debt, a
short time before his stoppage. It was in
elucidating the transaction Mr. Jarvis had
paid Benfield Lodge a visit, and restored the
bachelor his property. This act, and the
high opinion he entertained of Mrs. Wilson,
with his unbounded love for Emily, were the
few things which prevented his believing some
dreadful judgment was about to visit this
world, for its increasing wickedness and
follies
.
The horses being ready, the old bachelor
was placed carefully between his nephew
and niece, and in that manner they rode on
quietly to the Hall, the dread of accident
keeping Mr. Benfield silent the most of the
way. On passing, however, a stately castle,
about ten miles from the termination of their
ride, he began one of his speeches with,
Emmy dear, does my Lord Bolton
come often to see you? Very seldom, sir;
his employment keeps him much of his time
at St. James's, and then he has an estate in
Ireland. I knew his father wellhe was
distantly connected by marriage with my
friend Lord Gosford; you could not
remember
him, I expect: (John rolled his eyes at
this suggestion of his sister's recollection of
a man who had been forty years dead, as his
uncle continued;) he always voted with me
in the parliament of this realm; he was a
thorough honest man; very much such a
man to look at, as Peter Johnson, my
steward
:
but I am told his son likes the good
things of the ministrywell, wellWilliam
Pitt was the only minister to my mind.
There was the Scotchman they made a
Marquis
of, I never could endure himalways
voted against himright or wrong, uncle,
cried John, who loved a little mischief in his
heart.
No, sirright, but never wrong. Lord
Gosford always voted against him too; and
do you think, jackanapes, that my friend the
Earl of Gosford andandmyself were
ever wrong? No, sir, men in my day were
different creatures from what they are now:
we were never wrong, sir; we loved our
country, and had no motive for being in the
wrong.
How was it with Lord Bute, uncle?
Lord Bute, sir, cried the old man with
great warmth, was the minister, sirhe was
the minister; ay, he was the minister, sir,
and was paid for what he did.
But Lord Chatham, was he not the
minister
too?
Now, nothing vexed the old gentleman
more, than to hear William Pitt called by his
tardy honours; and yet, unwilling to give up
what he thought his political opinions, he
exclaimed, with an unanswerable positiveness
of argument, Billy Pitt, sir, was the
minister
,
sir; butbutbuthe was
our
minister
,
sir.
Emily, unable to see her uncle agitated by
such useless disputes, threw a reproachful
glance on her brother, as she observed
timidly
,
that was a glorious administration, sir,
I believe.
Glorious indeed! Emmy dear, said the
bachelor, softening with the sound of her
voice and the recollections of his younger
days, we beat the French every wherein
Americain Germany;we took(counting
on his fingers)we took Quebecyes, Lord
Gosford lost a cousin there; and we took
all the Canadas; and we took their fleets:
there was a young man killed in the battle
between Hawke and Conflans, who was
much attached to Lady Julianapoor soul!
how she regretted him when dead, though
she never could abide him when livingah!
she was a tender-hearted creature! For Mr.
Benfield, like many others, continued to
love imaginary qualities in his mistress, long
after her heartless coquetry had disgusted
him with her person: a kind of feeling which
springs from self-love, that finds it necessary
to seek consolation in creating beauties, that
may justify our follies to ourselves; and which
often keeps alive the semblance of the
passion
,
when even hope or real admiration is
extinct.
On reaching the Hall, every one was
rejoiced
to see their really affectionate and
3*
worthy relative, and the evening passed in
the tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
Providence had profusely scattered around
the family of the baronet, but which are too
often hazarded by a neglect of duty, that
springs from too great security, or an
indolence
which renders us averse to the
precaution
necessary to insure their continuance.
CHAPTER IV.
You
are welcome, Sir Edward, said
the venerable rector, as he took the baronet
by the hand; I was fearful a return of your
rheumatism would deprive us of this pleasure,
and prevent my making you acquainted with
the new occupants of the deanery; who have
consented to dine with us to-day, and to
whom I have promised in particular, an
introduction
to Sir Edward Moseley.
I thank you, my dear doctor, rejoined
the baronet, I have not only come myself,
but have persuaded Mr. Benfield to make
one of the party; there he comes, leaning on
Emily's arm, and finding fault with Mrs.
Wilson's new fashioned barouche, which he
says has given him cold.
The rector received the unexpected guest
with the kindness of his nature, and an
inward
smile at the incongruous assemblage he
was likely to have around him by the arrival
of the Jarvis's, who, at that moment, drove
to his door. The introductions between the
baronet and the new comers had passed, and
Miss Jarvis had made a prettily worded
apology
on behalf of the colonel, who was not
yet well enough to come out, but whose
politeness
had insisted on their not remaining
at home on his account; as Mr. Benfield,
having composedly put on his spectacles,
walked deliberately up to where the
merchant
had seated himself, and having
examined
him through his glasses to his satisfaction,
took them off, and carefully wiping them,
began to talk to himself as he put them into
his pocketNo, no; it's not Jack, the
hackney coachman, nor my Lord Gosford's
gentleman, butcordially holding out both
hands, it's the man who saved my twenty
thousand pounds.
Mr. Jarvis, who a kind of shame had
kept silent during this examination,
exchanged
his greetings sincerely with his
old acquaintance, who now took a seat
in silence by his side; while his wife, whose
face had begun to kindle with indignation at
the commencement of the old gentleman's
soliloquy
,
observing that somehow or other it
had not only terminated without degradation
to her spouse, but with something like credit,
turned complacently to Mrs. Ives, with an
apology for the absence of her son. I
cannot
divine, ma'am where he has got to; he is
ever keeping us waiting for him; and
addressing
Jane, these military men become
so unsettled in their habits, that I often tell
Harry he should never quit the camp.
In Hyde Park, you should add, my dear,
for he has never been in any other, bluntly
observed her husband. To this speech no
reply was made, but it was evidently not
relished
by the ladies of the family, who were
not a little jealous of the laurels of the only
hero their race had ever produced. The
arrival
and introduction of the captain himself,
changed the discourse, which turned on the
comforts of their present residence.
Pray, my lady, cried the captain, who
had taken a chair familiarly by the side of the
baronet's wife, why is the house called the
deanery? I am afraid I shall be taken for a
son of the church, when I invite my friends
to visit my father at the deanery.
And you may add, at the same time, sir,
if you please, dryly remarked Mr. Jarvis,
that it is occupied by an old man, who has
been preaching and lecturing all his life;
and like others of the trade, I believe, in vain.
You must except our good friend, the
doctor here, at least, sir, said Mrs. Wilson;
and then observing her sister to shrink from
a familiarity she was unused to, she replied
to the captain's question: The father of
the present Sir William Harris held that
station
in the church, and although the house
was his private property, it took its name from
that circumstance, which has been continued
ever since.
Is it not a droll life Sir William leads,
cried Miss Jarvis, looking at John Moseley,
riding about all summer, from one
watering
place to another, and letting his house
year after year in the manner he does?
Sir William, said Dr. Ives gravely, is
devoted to his daughter's wishes, and since
his accession to his title, has come into
possession
of another residence, in an adjoining
county, which, I believe, he retains in his own
hands.
Are you acquainted with Miss Harris?
continued the lady, addressing herself to
Clara; and without waiting for an answer,
added, She is a great belleall the
gentlemen
are dying for her.
Or her fortune, said her sister, with a
contemptuous toss of the head; for my part,
I never could see any thing so captivating in
her, although so much is said about her at
Bath and Brighton.
You know her then, mildly observed
Clara.
Why, I cannot saywe are exactly
acquainted
,
hesitatingly answered the young
lady, and colouring violently as she spoke.
What do you mean, by exactly
acquainted
,
Sally? cried her father with a laugh;
did you ever speak to, or were you ever in
a room with her in your life, unless it might
be at a concert or a ball?
The mortification of Miss Sarah was too
evident for concealment, and was happily
relieved
by a summons to dinner.
Never, my dear child, said Mrs.
Wilson
to Emily, the aunt being fond of
introducing
a moral, from the occasional
incidents
of every-day life, never subject
yourself to a similar mortification, by
commenting
on the character of those you don't
know: your ignorance makes you liable to
great errors; and if they should happen to
be above you in life, it will only excite their
contempt, should it reach their ears; while
those to whom your remarks are made, will
think it envy.
Truth is sometimes blundered on, cried
John, who held his sister's arm, waiting for
his aunt to precede them to the dining room.
The merchant paid too great a compliment
to the rector's dinner to think of renewing the
disagreeable conversation, and as John
Moseley
and the young clergyman were seated
next the two ladies, they soon forgot what,
among themselves, they would call their
father's
rudeness, in receiving the attentions of
a couple of remarkably agreeable young men.
Pray, Mr. Francis, when do you preach
for us? asked Mr. Haughton; I'm very
anxious to hear you hold forth from the
pulpit
,
where I have so often heard your father
with pleasure: I doubt not you will prove
orthodox, or you will be the only man, I
believe
,
in the congregation, the rector has left
in ignorance, of the theory of our religion, at
least.
The doctor bowed to the compliment, as
he replied to the question for his son; that
on the next Sunday, they were to have the
pleasure of hearing Frank, who had promised
to assist him on that day.
Any prospects of a living soon?
continued
Mr. Haughton, helping himself
bountifully
to a piece of plumb pudding as he spoke.
John Moseley laughed aloud, and Clara
blushed to the eyes, while the doctor, turning
to Sir Edward, observed with an air of
interest
,
Sir Edward, the living of Bolton is
vacant, and I should like exceedingly to
obtain
it for my son. The advowson belongs
to the Earl, who will dispose of it only to
great interest, I am afraid.
Clara was certainly too busily occupied in
picking raisins from her pudding, to hear this
remark, but accidentally stole, from under
her long eye-lashes, a timid glance at her
father
,
as he replied:
I am sorry, my friend, I have not
sufficient
interest with his lordship to apply on
my own account; but he is so seldom here,
we are barely acquainted; and the good
baronet
looked really concerned.
Clara, said Francis Ives in a low and
affectionate tone, have you read the books
I sent you? Clara answered him with a
smile in the negative, but promised
amendment
as soon as she had leisure.
Do you ride much on horseback, Mr.
Moseley? abruptly asked Miss Sarah,
turning
her back on the young divine, and facing
the gentleman she addressed. John, who
was now hemmed in between the sisters,
replied
with a rueful expression, that brought
a smile into the face of Emily, who was
placed opposite to him
Yes, ma'am, and sometimes I am ridden.
Ridden, sir, what do you mean by that?
Oh! only my aunt there (he whispered)
gives me a lecture now and then.
Oh ho! said the lady in the same tone,
with a knowing leer, and pointing slily with
her finger at her own father.
Does it feel good? said John in the
same manner, and with a look of great
sympathy
:
but the lady, who now felt
awkwardly
,
without knowing exactly why, shook her
head in silence as she forced a faint laugh.
Who have we here? cried Captain
Jarvis, as he looked through a window which
commanded a view of the approach to the
housethe apothecary and his attendant,
judging from their equipage.
The rector threw an inquiring look on a
servant, who told his master they were
strangers
to him.
Have them shown up, doctor, cried the
benevolent baronet, who loved to see every
one as happy as himself, and give them
some of your excellent pasty, for the credit of
your cook, I beg of you; and as this request
was politely seconded by others of the party,
the rector bid them show the strangers in.
On opening the parlour door, a gentleman,
apparently sixty years of age, appeared,
leaning
on the arm of a youth of five-and-twenty.
There was sufficient resemblance between
the two, for the most indifferent observer to
pronounce them father and son; but the
helpless debility and emaciated figure of the
former, was finely contrasted by the
vigorous
VOL. I. 4
health and manly beauty of the latter,
who supported his venerable parent into the
room, with a grace and tenderness, that struck
most of the beholders with an indescribable
sensation of pleasure. The doctor and Mrs.
Ives rose from their seats involuntarily, and
stood each for a moment as if lost in an
astonishment
that was mingled with grief.
Recollecting
himself, the rector grasped the
extended
hand of the senior in both his own,
and endeavoured to utter something, but in
vain; the tears followed each other down his
cheeks, as he looked on the faded and
careworn
figure which stood before him; while
his wife, unable to control her feelings, sunk
back into a chair and wept aloud.
Throwing open the door of an adjoining
room, and retaining the hand of the invalid,
the doctor gently led the way, followed by
his wife and son; the former having
recovered
from the first burst of her sorrow, and
who now, regardless of every thing else,
anxiously watched the enfeebled step of the
stranger. On reaching the door, they both
turned and bowed to the company in a
manner
of much dignity, mingled with sweetness,
that all, not excepting Mr. Benfield, rose from
their seats to return the salutation. On
passing
from the dining parlour, the door was
closed, leaving the company standing round
the table, in mute astonishment and
commiseration
,
at the scene they had just
witnessed
.
Not a word had been spoken, and
the rector's family had left them without
apology
or explanation. Francis, however, soon
returned, and was followed in a few minutes
by his mother, who, slightly apologising for
her absence, turned the discourse on the
approaching
Sunday, and the intention of
Francis
to preach on that day. The Moseleys
were too well bred to make any inquiries, and
the Deanery family appeared afraid. Sir
Edward
retired at a very early hour, and was
followed by the remainder of the party.
Well, cried Mrs. Jarvis, as they drove
from the door, this may be good breeding,
but for my part, I think both the doctor and
Mrs. Ives behaved very rude, with their
crying
and sobbing.
They are nobody of much consequence,
cried her eldest daughter, casting a
contemptuous
glance on a plain travelling chaise
which stood before the rector's stables.
'T was sickening, said Miss Sarah, with
a shrug; while her father, turning his eyes
on each speaker in succession, very
deliberately
helped himself to a pinch of snuff, his
ordinary recourse against a family quarrel.
The curiosity of the ladies was, however,
more lively than they chose to avow; and
Mrs. Jarvis bade her maid go over to the
Rectory
that evening, with her compliments to
Mrs. Ives; she had lost a lace veil, which
her maid knew, and thought she might have
left it at the Rectory.
And Jones, when you are there, you can
inquire of the servants; mind, of the servants
I would not distress Mrs. Ives for the
world; how Mr.Mr.what's his name
LudI have forgotten his name; just bring
me his name too, Jones; and it may make
some difference in our party, so just find out
how long they stay; andandany other
little thing Jones, which can be of use, you
know. Off went Jones, and within an hour
returned again. With an important look,
she commenced her narrative, the daughters
being accidentally present.
Why ma'am, I went across the fields, and
William was good enough to go with me; so
when we got there, I rung, and they showed
us into the servants' room, and I gave my
message, and the veil was not there. Lord,
ma'am, there's the veil now, on the back o'
that chair.Very well, very well, Jones,
never mind the veil, cried her impatient
mistress
.
So, madam, while they were looking for
the veil. I just asked one of the maids, what
company had arrived, but(here Jones
looked
very suspiciously, and shook her head
significantly
:)
would you think it, ma'am, not
a soul of them knew. But, ma'am, there was
the doctor and his son, praying and reading
with the old gentleman the whole time
and
And what, Jones?
Why, ma'am, I expect he has been a great
sinner, or he would'nt want so much
praying
just as he is about to die.
Die! cried all three at once, will he
die?
O yes, continued Jones, they all
agree he must die; but this praying so much,
is just like the criminals; I'm sure no honest
person needs so much praying ma'am.
No, indeed, said the mother: no,
indeed
,
responded the daughters, as they
retired
to their several rooms for the night.

CHAPTER V.
There
is something in the season of
Spring which peculiarly excites the feelings
of devotion. The dreariness of winter has
passed, and with it, the deadened affections of
our nature. New life, new vigour, arises
within us, as we walk abroad and feel the
genial gales of April breathe upon us; and
our hopesour wishes, awaken with the
revival
of the vegetable world. It is then that
the heart, which has been impressed with the
goodness of the Creator, feels that goodness
brought, as it were, in very contact with our
senses. The eye loves to wander over the
bountiful provisions nature is throwing forth
in every direction for our comfort; and
fixing
its gaze on the clouds, which having lost
the chilling thinness of winter, roll in rich
volumes, amidst the clear and softened fields
of azure so peculiar to the season, and leads
the mind insensibly to dwell on the things of
another and a better world. It was on such
a day, the inhabitants of B thronged
toward
the village church, for the double
purpose
of pouring out their thanksgivings, and
of hearing the first efforts of their rector's
child, in the duties of his sacred calling.
Amongst the crowd, whom curiosity or a
better feeling had drawn forth, were to be
seen the modern equipages of the Jarvises,
and the handsome carriages of Sir Edward
Moseley and his sister. All the members of
this latter family felt a lively anxiety for the
success of the young divine. But knowing,
as they well did, the strength of his native
talents
,
the excellency of his education, and the
fervour of his piety, it was an anxiety that
partook more of hope than of fear. There
was one heart, however, amongst them, that
palpitated with an emotion that hardly
admitted
of control, as they approached the
sacred
edifice, and which had identified itself
with the welfare of the rector's son. There
never was a softer, truer heart, than that
which now almost audibly beat within the
bosom of Clara Moseley; and she had given
it to the young divine with all its purity and
truth.
The entrance of a congregation into the
sanctuary will at all times furnish, to an
attentive
observer, food for much useful
speculation
,
if it he chastened with a proper
charity
for the weaknesses of others; and most
people are ignorant of the insight they are
giving into their characters and dispositions,
by such an apparently trivial circumstance
as their weekly approach to the tabernacles
of the Lord. Christianity, while it
chasteneth
and amends the heart, leaves the natural
powers unaltered; and it cannot be doubted,
that its operation is, or ought to be,
proportionate
to the abilities and opportunities of
the subject of its holy impressionunto
whomsoever much is given, much will be
required
.
And at the same time we
acknowledge
,
that the thoughts might be better
employed
in preparing for those humiliations of
the spirit and thanksgiving of the heart,
which are required of all, and are so
necessary
to all; we must be indulged in a hasty
view of some of the personages of our
history
,
as they entered the church of B. On
the countenance of the baronet, was the
dignity
and composure of a mind at peace with
itself and mankind. His step was rather
more deliberate than common; his eye
rested
on the pavement, and on turning into his
pew, as he prepared to kneel, in the first
humble
petition of our beautiful service, he raised
it towards the altar, with an expression of
benevolence and reverence, that spoke
contentment
,
not unmixed with faith.
In the demeanour of Lady Moseley, all
was graceful and decent, although nothing
could be said to be studied. She followed
her husband with a step of equal
deliberation
,
that was slightly varied by an
observance
of a manner which appeared natural to
herself, but might have been artificial to
another
:
her cambric handkerchief concealed
her face as she sunk composedly by the side
of Sir Edward, in a style which showed, that
while she remembered her Maker, she had
not entirely forgotten herself.
The walk of Mrs. Wilson was quicker
than that of her sister. Her eye directed
before her, fixed, as if in settled gaze, on that
eternity to which she was approaching. The
lines of her contemplative face were
unaltered
,
unless there might be traced a deeper
shade of humility than was ordinarily seen
on her pale, but expressive countenance: her
petition was long; and on rising from her
humble posture, the person was indeed to
be seen, but the soul appeared absorbed in
contemplations far beyond the limits of this
sphere.
There was a restlessness and varying of
colour, in the ordinarily placid Clara, which
prevented a display of her usual manner;
while Jane walked gracefully, and with a
tincture of her mother's form, by her side.
She stole one hastily withdrawn glance to
the deanery pew ere she kneeled, and then,
on rising, handed her smelling bottle
affectionately
to her elder sister.
Emily glided behind her companions with
a face beaming with a look of innocence and
love. As she sunk in the act of supplication,
the rich glow of her healthful cheek lost some
of its brilliancy; but, on rising, it beamed
with a renewed lustre, that plainly indicated
a heart sensibly touched with the sanctity of
its situation.
In the composed and sedate manner of Mr.
Jarvis, as he steadily pursued his way to the
pew of Sir William Harris, you might have
been justified in expecting the entrance of
another
Sir Edward Moseley in substance, if
not in externals; but his deliberate
separation
of the flaps of his coat, as he
comfortably
seated himself, when you thought him
about to kneel, and followed by a pinch of
snuff, as he threw his eye around in
examination
of the building, led you at once to
conjecture, that what at first you had
mistaken
for reverence, was the abstraction of
some earthly calculation; and that his
attendance
was in compliance with custom, and
not a little depended upon the thickness of
his cushions, and the room he found for the
disposition of his unwieldy legs.
The ladies of the family followed, in
garments
carefully selected for the advantageous
display of their persons. As they sailed into
their seats, where it would seem the
improvidence
of Sir William's steward had
neglected
some important accommodation, (for some
time was spent in preparation to be seated,)
the old lady, whose size and flesh really put
kneeling out of the question, bent forward
for a moment at an angle of eighty with the
horizon, while her daughters prettily bowed
their heads, with all proper precaution for the
safety of their superb millinery.
At length the rector, accompanied by his
son, appeared from the vestry. There was
a dignity and solemnity in the manner in
which this pious divine entered on the duties
of his profession, which struck forcibly on
the imaginations of those who witnessed it,
and disposed the heart to listen, with
reverence
and humility, to precepts that flowed
from so impressive an exterior. The stillness
of expectation pervaded the church; when
the pew opener led the way to the same
interesting
father and son, whose entrance had
interrupted the guests the preceding day at
the rectory. Every eye was turned on the
emaciated parent, bending into the grave,
and, as it were, kept from it by the supporting
tenderness of his child. Hastily throwing
open the door of her pew, Mrs. Ives buried
her face in her handkerchief; and her
husband
had proceeded far in the morning
service
,
before she raised it again to the view of
the congregation. In the voice of the rector,
there was an unusual softness and tremor, that
his people attributed to the feelings of a
father
,
about to witness the first efforts of an
only child in his arduous duties, but which in
reality were owing to another and a deeper
cause.
Prayers were ended, and the younger Ives
ascended the pulpit; for a moment he paused
and casting one anxious glance to the pew
of the baronet, he commenced his sermon.
He had chosen for his discourse the
necessity
of placing our dependence on divine grace
for happiness here or hereafter. After having
learnedly, but in the most unaffected manner,
displayed the necessity of this dependence, as
affording security against the evils of this life,
he proceeded to paint the hope, the
resignation
,
the felicity of a christian's death-bed.
Warmed by the subject, his animation had
given a heightened interest to his language;
and at a moment, when all around him were
entranced by the eloquence of the youthful
divine, a sudden and deep-drawn sigh drew
every eye to the rector's pew. The younger
stranger sat motionless as a statue, holding in
his arms the lifeless body of his parent, who
had fallen that moment a corpse by his side.
All was now confusion: the almost insensible
young man was relieved from his burthen;
and, led by the rector, they left the church.
The congregation dispersed in silence, or
assembled
in little groups, to converse on the
awful event they had witnessed. None knew
the deceased; he was the rector's friend, and
to his residence the body had been removed.
The young man was evidently his child; but
here all information ended. They had
arrived
in a private chaise, but with post
horses
,
and without attendants. Their arrival
at the parsonage was detailed, with a few
exaggerations, by the Jarvis ladies, that gave
additional interest to the whole event; and
which, by creating an impression with those,
gentler feelings would not have restrained,
there was something of mystery about them;
prevented many distressing questions to the
Ives', that the baronet's family forbore putting
on the score of delicacy. The body left
B at the close of the week,
accompanied
by Francis Ives and the unwearied
attentions
of the interesting son. The doctor and
his wife went into deep mourning, and Clara
received a short note from her lover, on the
morning of their departure, acquainting her
with his intended absence for a month, but
throwing no light upon the affair. The
London papers, however, contained the
following
obituary notice, and which, as it
could refer to no other, was universally
supposed
to allude to the rector's friend.
Died, suddenly, at B, on the 20th
instant, George Denbigh, Esq. aged 63.

CHAPTER VI.
During
the week, the intercourse between
Moseley-Hall and the Rectory had been
confined to messages and notes of
inquiry
after each other's welfare; but the
visit of the Moseleys to the Deanery had
been returned; and the day after the
appearance
of the obituary paragraph, they dined
by invitation at the Hall. Colonel Egerton
had recovered the use of his leg, and was
included
in the party. Between this
gentleman
and Mr. Benfield, there appeared from
the first moment of their introduction, a
repugnance
,
which was rather increased by
time, and which the old gentleman
manifested
by a demeanour, loaded with the
overstrained
ceremony of his day; and in the
colonel, only showed itself by avoiding, when
possible, all intercourse with the object of his
aversion. Both Sir Edward and Lady
Moseley
,
on the contrary, were not slow in
manifesting
their favourable impressions in behalf
of this gentleman; the latter, in particular,
having ascertained to her satisfaction, that he
was the undoubted heir to the title, and most
probably to the estates of his uncle, Sir
Edgar
Egerton, felt herself strongly disposed to
encourage an acquaintance she found so
agreeable, and to which she could see no
reasonable objection. Captain Jarvis, who
was extremely offensive to her, from his
vulgar
familiarity, she barely tolerated on
account
of the necessity of being civil, and
keeping up sociability in the neighbourhood.
It is true, she could not help being surprised,
that a gentleman, as polished as the colonel,
could find any pleasure in an associate like
his friend, or even in the hardly more
softened
females of his family; then again, the
flattering suggestion would present itself,
that possibly he might have seen Emily at
Bath, or Jane elsewhere, and have availed
himself of the acquaintance of young Jarvis
to place himself in their neighbourhood.
Lady Moseley had never been vain, or much
interested about the disposal of her own
person
,
previously to her attachment to her
husband
;
but her daughters called forth not a
little of her natural pridewe had almost said
selfishness.
The attentions of the colonel were of the
most polished and insinuating kind; and
Mrs. Wilson several times turned away in
displeasure at herself, for listening with too
much satisfaction to nothings, uttered in an
agreeable manner, or what was worse, false
sentiments supported with the gloss of
language
and fascinating deportment. The
anxiety of this lady on behalf of Emily, kept
her ever on the alert, when chance, or any
chain of circumstances, threw her in the way
of forming new connexions of any kind;
and of late, as her charge approached the
period of life, her sex were apt to make that
choice from which there is no retreat, her
solicitude to examine the characters of the
men who approached her, was really
painful
.
In Lady Moseley, her wishes disposed
her to be easily satisfied, and her mind
naturally
shrunk from an investigation she felt
herself unequal to; while in Mrs. Wilson,
it was the conviction of a sound discretion,
matured by long and deep reasoning, acting
upon a temper at all times ardent, and a
watchfulness eminently calculated to endure
to the end.
Pray, my lady, cried Mrs. Jarvis, with
a look of something like importance, have
you made any discovery about this Mr.
Denbigh
,
who died in the church lately?
I did not know, madam, replied Lady
Moseley, there was any discovery to be
made.
You know, Lady Moseley, said Colonel
Egerton, that in town, all the little
accompaniments
of such a melancholy death, would
have found their way into the prints; and I
suppose it is to that Mrs. Jarvis alludes.
O yes, cried Mrs. Jarvis, the colonel
is right; and the colonel was always right
with that lady. Lady Moseley bowed her
head with dignity, and the colonel had too
much tact to pursue the conversation; but
the captain, whom nothing had ever yet
abashed, exclaimed, these Denbigh's could
not be people of much importanceI have
never heard the name before.
It is the family name of the Duke of
Derwent, I believe, dryly remarked Sir
Edward.
Oh, I am sure neither the old man or his
son looked much like a duke, or so much as
an officer either, cried Mrs. Jarvis, who
thought the last the next dignity in degree
below nobility.
There sat, in the parliament of this realm,
when I was a member, a General Denbigh,
said Mr. Benfield with great deliberation;
he was always on the same side with Lord
Gosford and myself. He and his friend, Sir
Peter Howell, who was the admiral that
took the French squadron, in the glorious
administration of Billy Pitt, and afterwards
took an island with this same General
Denbigh
:
ay, the old admiral was a hearty old
blade, a good deal such a looking man as my
Hector would make. Hector was his bull
dog.
Mercy, whispered John to Clara,
that's your grandfather that is to be, uncle
Benfield speaks of.
Clara smiled, as she ventured to say, Sir
Peter was Mrs. Ives' father, sir.
Indeed! said the old gentleman with a
look of surprise, I never knew that before;
I cannot say they resemble each other much.
Pray, uncle, does Frank look much like
5*
the family? cried John, with an air of
unconquerable
gravity.
But, sir, said Emily with quickness,
were General Denbigh and Admiral
Howell
related?
Not that I ever knew, Emmy dear, he
replied. Sir Frederic Denbigh did not
look much like the admiral; he rather
resembled
(gathering himself up into an air of
stiff formality, and bowing to Colonel
Egerton
)
this gentleman here.
I have not the honour of the connexion,
observed the colonel, as he withdrew behind
the chair of Jane.
Mrs. Wilson changed the conversation to
a more general one; but the little that had
fallen from Mr. Benfield gave reason for
believing
a connexion, in some way they were
ignorant of, existed between the descendants
of the veterans, and which explained the
interest
they felt in each other.
During dinner, Colonel Egerton placed
himself next to Emily; and Miss Jarvis took
the chair on his other side. He spoke of the
gay world, of watering places, novels, plays
and still finding his companion reserved, and
either unwilling or unable to talk freely, he
tried his favourite sentiments; he had read
poetry, and a remark of his had lighted up a
spark of intelligence in the beautiful face of
his companion, that for a moment deceived
him; but as he went on, to point out his
favourite
beauties, it gave place to that settled
composure, which at last led him to imagine,
the casket contained no gem equal to the
promise of its brilliant exterior. After
resting
from one of his most laboured displays of
feeling and imagery, he accidentally caught
the eyes of Jane fastened on him, with an
expression of no dubious import, and the
soldier changed his battery. In Jane, he
found a more willing auditor; poetry was
the food she lived upon, and in works of the
imagination, she found her greatest delight.
An animated discussion of the merits of their
favourite authors now took place; to renew
which, the colonel early left the dining room
for the society of the ladies; John, who
disliked
drinking excessively, was happy of an
excuse to attend him.
The younger ladies had clustered together
round a window; and even Emily in her
heart rejoiced that the gentlemen had come
to relieve herself and sisters from the
arduous
task of entertaining women, who
appeared
not to possess a single taste or
opinion
in common with themselves.
You were saying, Miss Moseley, cried
the colonel in his most agreeable manner, as
he approached them, you thought
Campbell
the most musical poet we have; I hope
you will unite with me in excepting Moore.
Jane coloured, as with some awkwardness
she replied, Moore was certainly very
poetical
.
Has Moore written much? innocently
asked Emily.
Not half as much as he ought, cried
Miss Jarvis. Oh! I could live on his
beautiful lines. Jane turned away in
disgust
;
and that evening, while alone with
Clara, she took a volume of Moore's songs,
and very coolly consigned them to the flames.
Her sister naturally asked an explanation of
such vengeance.
Oh! cried Jane, I can't abide the
book, since that vulgar Miss Jarvis speaks of
it with so much interest. I really believe
aunt Wilson is right, in not suffering Emily
to read such things; and Jane, who had
often devoured the treacherous lines with
ardour, shrunk with fastidious delicacy from
the indulgence of a perverted taste, when
exposed to her view, coupled with the
vulgarity
of unblushing audacity.
Colonel Egerton immediately changed the
subject to one less objectionable, and spoke
of a campaign he had made in Spain. He
possessed the happy faculty of giving an
interest
to all he advanced, whether true or
not; and as he never contradicted or even
opposed, unless to yield gracefully when a
lady was his opponent, his conversation
insensibly
attracted, by putting others in good
humour with themselves. Such a man,
aided
by the powerful assistants of person and
manners, and no inconsiderable colloquial
talents, Mrs. Wilson knew to be extremely
dangerous as a companion to a youthful
female
heart; and as his visit was to extend to
a couple of months, she resolved to
reconnoitre
the state of her pupil's opinion in
relation
to their military beaux. She had taken
too much pains in forming the mind of
Emily
,
to apprehend she would fall a victim to
the eye; but she also knew, that personal
grace sweetened a, benevolent expression, or
added force even to the oracles of wisdom.
She laboured a little herself, under the
disadvantage
of what John called a didactic
manner; and which, although she had not
the ability, or rather taste, to amend, she had
yet the sense to discern. It was the great
error of Mrs. Wilson, to attempt to convince,
where she might have influenced; but her
ardour of temperament, and great love of
truth, kept her, as it were, tilting with the
vices of mankind, and consequently
sometimes
in unprofitable combat. With her
charge, however, this could never be said to
be the case. Emily knew her heart, felt
her love, and revered her principles too
deeply
,
to throw away an admonition, or
disregard
a precept, that fell from lips she
knew never spoke idly, or without
consideration
.
John had felt tempted to push the
conversation
with Miss Jarvis, and he was about
to utter something rapturous respecting the
melodious poison of Little's poems, as the
blue eye of Emily rested on him in the
fulness
of sisterly affection, and checking his
love of the ridiculous, he quietly yielded to
his respect for the innocence of his sisters;
and as if eager to draw the attention of all
from the hateful subject, put question after
question to Egerton concerning the Spaniards
and their customs.
Did you ever meet Lord Pendennyss in
Spain, Colonel Egerton? inquired Mrs.
Wilson with interest.
Never, madam, replied he. I have
much reason to regret, that our service laid
in different parts of the country; his lordship
was much with the duke, and I made the
campaign under Marshal Beresford.
Emily left the group at the window, and
taking a seat on the sofa, by the side of her
aunt, insensibly led her to forget the gloomy
thoughts which had began to steal over her;
as the colonel, approaching where they sat,
continued by asking
Are you acquainted with the earl,
madam
?
Not in person, but by character, said
Mrs. Wilson, in a melancholy manner.
His character as a soldier was very high.
He had no superior of his years in Spain, I am
told.
No reply was made to this remark, and
Emily endeavoured anxiously to draw the
mind of her aunt to reflections of a more
agreeable nature. The colonel, whose
vigilance
to please was ever on the alert, kindly
aided her, and they soon succeeded.
The merchant withdrew with his family
and guest in proper season; and Mrs. Wilson,
heedful of her duty, took the opportunity of
a quarter of an hour's privacy in her own
dressing room in the evening, to touch gently
on the subject of the gentlemen they had seen
that day.
How are you pleased, Emily, with your
new acquaintances? commenced Mrs.
Wilson
,
with a smile.
Oh! aunt, don't ask me, said her niece,
laughingly, as John says, they are
new
indeed.
I am not sorry, continued the aunt,
to have you observe more closely than you
have been used to, the manner of such
women as the Jarvis's; they are too abrupt
and unpleasant to create a dread of any
imitation
;
but the gentlemen are heroes in very
different style.
Different from each other, indeed,
cried
Emily.
Which do you give the preference to,
my dear?
Preference, aunt! said her niece, with
a look of astonishment; preference is a
strong word for either; but I rather think the
captain the most eligible companion of the
two. I do believe you see the worst of him;
and although I acknowledge it to be bad
enough, he might amend; but the colonel
Go on, said Mrs. Wilson.
Why, every thing about the colonel
seems so seated, so ingrafted in his nature, so
so very self-satisfied, that I am afraid it
would be a difficult task to take the first step
in amendmentto convince him of his
being
in the wrong.
And is he in the wrong?
Emily looked up from arranging some
laces
,
with an expression of surprise, as she
replied
,
did you not hear him talk of those
poems, and attempt to point out the beauties
of several works? I thought every thing he
uttered was referred to taste, and that not a
very natural one; at least, she added with a
laugh, it differed greatly from mine. He
seemed to forget there was such a thing as
principle: and then he spoke of some woman
to Jane, who left her father for her lover,
with so much admiration of her feelings, to
take up with poverty and love, in place of
condemning her want of filial piety; I am
sure, aunt, if you had heard that, you would
not admire him so much.
I do not admire him, child; I only want
to know your sentiments, and I am happy to
find them so correct. It is as you think;
Colonel Egerton appears to refer nothing to
principle: even the generous feelings of our
nature, I am afraid, are corrupted in him,
from too much intercourse with the surface
of society. There is by far too much
pliability
about him for principle of any kind,
unless indeed it be a principle to please, no
matter how. No one, who has deeply
seated
opinions of right and wrong, will ever
abandon them, even in the courtesies of polite
intercourse; they may be silent, but never
acquiescent; in short, my dear, the dread of
offending our Maker, ought to be so superior
to that of offending our fellow creatures,
that we should endeavour, I believe, to be
more unbending to the follies of the world
than we are.
And yet the colonel is what they call a
good companionI mean a pleasant one.
In the ordinary meaning of the words,
he is certainly, my dear; yet you soon tire of
sentiments which will not stand the test of
examination, and of a manner you cannot
but see is artificial. He may do very well
for a companion, but very ill for a friend; in
short, Colonel Egerton has neither been
satisfied
to yield to his natural impressions, or
to obtain new ones from a proper source; he
has copied from bad models, and his work
must necessarily be imperfectand kissing
her niece, she retired into her own room,
with the happy assurance, that she had not
laboured in vain; but that, with divine aid,
she had implanted a guide in the bosom of
her charge, that could not fail, with ordinary
care, to lead her strait through the devious
paths of female duties.

CHAPTER VII.
A month
now passed in the ordinary
avocations
and amusements of a country life,
and during which, both Lady Moseley and
Jane manifested a desire to keep up the
Deanery acquaintance, that surprised Emily
a little, who had ever seen her mother shrink
from communications with those whose
breeding
subjected her own delicacy, to the little
shocks she could but ill conceal. And in
Jane it was yet more inexplicable; for Jane
had, in a decided way very common to her,
avowed her disgust of the manners of these
new associates on their first acquaintance;
and yet Jane would now even quit her own
society for that of Miss Jarvis, especiallyif
Colonel Egerton were of the party. The
innocence
of Emily prevented her scanning the
motives which could induce such a change
in the conduct of her sister; and she set
seriously
about an examination into her own
deportment to find the latent cause, and
wherever opportunity offered, to evince the
tenderness of her own affections.
For a short time, the colonel had seemed
at a loss where to make his choice; but a few
days determined him, and Jane was now
evidently the favourite. It is true, that in the
presence of the Jarvis ladies, he was more
guarded and general in his attentions; but
as John, from a motive of charity, had taken
the direction of the captain's sports into his
own hands; and as they were in the frequent
habit of meeting at the Hall, preparatory to
their morning excursions, the colonel
suddenly
became a sportsman. The ladies would
often accompany them in their morning
rides; and as John would certainly be a
baronet
,
and the colonel might not if his uncle
married, he had the comfort of being
sometimes
ridden, as well as of riding.
One morning, having all prepared for an
excursion on horseback, as they stood at the
door ready to mount, Francis Ives drove up
in his father's gig, and for a moment arrested
their progress. Francis was a favourite with
the whole Moseley family, and their
greetings
were warm and sincere. He found they
meant to take the Rectory in their ride, and
insisted that they should proceed.
Clara
would take a seat with him; as he
spoke, the cast of his countenance brought
the colour into the cheeks of his intended,
who suffered herself to be handed into the
vacant seat of the gig, and they moved on.
John, who was at the bottom good-natured,
and loved both Francis and Clara very
sincerely
,
soon set Captain Jarvis and his
sister
what he called scrub racing, and
necessity
,
in some measure, compelled the
equestrians to ride fast to keep up with the
sports. That will do, that will do, cried
John, casting his eye back, and perceiving
they had lost sight of the gig, and almost of
Colonel Egerton and Jane, why you ride
like a jockey, captain; better than any
amateur
I have ever seen, unless indeed it be
your sister; and the lady, encouraged by
his commendations, whipped on, followed by
her brother and sister at half speed.
There, Emily, said John, as he quietly
dropped by her side, I see no reason you
and I should break our necks, to show the
blood of our horses. Now do you know, I
think we are going to have a wedding in the
family soon? Emily looked at him in
amazement, as he went on:
Frank has got a living; I saw it the
moment
he drove up. He came in like
somebody
.
Yes, I dare say he has calculated the
tythes a dozen times already.
And John was right. The Earl of Bolton
had, unsolicited, given him the desired living
of his own parish; and Francis was at the
moment pressing the blushing Clara to fix
the day that was to put a period to his long
probation in love. Clara, who had no spice
of coquetry, promised to be his as soon as he
was inducted, which was to take place the
following week; and then followed those
delightful
little arrangements and plans, with
which youthful hope is so fond of filling up
the voids in future life.
Doctor, said John, as he came out of
the rectory to assist Clara from the gig,
the parson here is a careful driver; see, he
has not turn'd a hair. He kissed the
burning
cheek of his sister as she touched the
ground, and whispered significantly, you
need tell me nothing, my dearI know all
I consent.
Mrs. Ives folded her future daughter to
her bosom, as she crossed the threshold; and
the benevolent smile of the good rector,
together with the kind and affectionate
manner of her sisters, assured Clara the
approaching nuptials were anticipated as a
matter of course. Colonel Egerton offered
his compliments to Francis, on his
preferment
to the living, with the polish of high
breeding, and not without the appearance of
interest in what he said; and Emily thought
him at that moment, for the first time, as
handsome as he was reputed generally. The
ladies undertook to say something civil in
their turn, and John put the captain, by a
hint, on the same track.
You are quite lucky, sir, said the
captain
,
in getting so good a living with so
little trouble; and I wish you joy of it with
all my heart: Mr. Moseley tells me it is a
capital good thing.
Francis thanked him for his good wishes,
and Egerton paid a handsome compliment to
the liberality of the earl; he doubted not he
found that gratification which always attends
a disinterested act; and Jane applauded
the sentiment with a smile.
The baronet, when on their return he was
6*
made acquainted with the situation of affairs,
promised Francis that no unnecessary delay
should intervene, and the marriage was
happily
arranged for the following week.
Lady
Moseley, when she retired to the drawing
room after dinner with her sister and
daughters
,
commenced a recital of the ceremony
and company to be invited on the occasion.
Etiquette and the decencies of life were not
only the forte, but the fault of this lady; and
she had gone on to the enumeration of about
the fortieth personage in the ceremonials,
before Clara found courage to say, that
Mr. Ives and myself both wished to be
married
at the altar, and to proceed to Bolton
Rectory immediately after the ceremony.
To this her mother warmly objected; and
argument and respectful remonstrance had
followed each other for some time, before
Clara submitted in silence, but with difficulty
restrained her tears. This appeal to the best
feelings of the mother triumphed; and she
yielded her love of splendour, to her love for
her offspring. Clara, with a lightened heart,
kissed and thanked her, and accompanied by
Emily, left the room. Jane had risen to
follow
them, but catching a glimpse of the
tilbury
of Colonel Egerton, re-seated herself,
calmly awaiting his entrance: he had
merely
driven over at the earnest entreaties of the
ladies, to beg Miss Jane would accept a seat
back with him; they had some little project on
foot, and could not proceed without her
assistance
.
Mrs. Wilson looked gravely at
her sister, as she smiled acquiescence to his
wishes; and the daughter, who but the
minute before had forgotten there was any
other person in the world but Clara, flew for
her hat and shawl, in order, as she said to
herself, the politeness of Colonel Egerton
might not keep him in waiting for her.
Lady
Moseley resumed her seat by the side of
her sister with an air of great complacency,
as having seen her daughter happily off, she
returned from the window. For some time,
each was occupied quietly with her needle,
for neither neglected their more useful
employments
in that way, in compliance with
the fashions of the day, when Mrs. Wilson
suddenly broke the silence with saying,
Who is Colonel Egerton?
Lady Moseley looked up for a moment in
amazement, but recollecting herself,
answered
,
nephew and heir of Sir Edgar
Egerton
,
sister. This was spoken in a rather
positive way, as if it were to be
unanswerable
;
yet as there was nothing harsh in the
reply, Mrs. Wilson continued,
Do you not think him attentive to Jane?
Pleasure sparkled in the yet brilliant eyes of
Lady Moseley, as she exclaimed
Do you think so?
I do; and you will pardon me if I say,
improperly so. I think you were wrong in
suffering Jane to go with him this
afternoon
.
Why improperly so, Charlotte; and if
Colonel Egerton is polite enough to show
Jane such attentions, should I not be wrong
in rudely rejecting them?
The rudeness of refusing a request
improper
to be granted, is a very venial offence,
I believe, replied Mrs. Wilson, with a smile;
and I confess I think it improper to allow
any attentions to be forced on us, that may
subject us to disagreeable consequences in any
way; but the attentions of Colonel Egerton
are becoming marked, Anne.
Do you for a moment doubt their being
honourable, or that he dares to trifle with a
daughter of Sir Edward Moseley? said the
mother with a shade of indignation.
I should hope not, certainly, replied her
aunt, although it may be well to guard
against such misfortunes too; but I am of
opinion it is quite as important, to know
whether he is worthy to be her husband, as
it is that he be serious in his intentions of
becoming so.
On what points, Charlotte, would you
wish to be more assured? You know his
birth and probable fortuneyou see his
manners
and disposition; but these latter, are
things for Jane to decide upon;
she
is to live
with him, and it is proper she should be
suited
in these respects.
I do not deny his fortune or his
disposition
,
but I complain that we give him credit
for the last and more important requisites,
without evidence of his possessing them.
His principles, his habits, his very character,
what do we know of it? I say we, for you
know, Anne, that your children are as dear
to me as my own would have been.
I believe you sincerely, said Lady
Mosley; but these things you mention are
points for Jane to decide on; if she be pleased,
I have no right to complain. I am
determined
never to controul the affections of my
children.
Had you said, never to force the
affections
of your children, you would have said
enough, Anne; but, to controul, or rather
guide the affections of a child, especially a
daughter, is a duty in some cases, as
imperious
as it would be to avert any other
impending
calamity. Surely the time to do
this, is before the affections of the child are
likely to endanger her peace of mind.
I have seldom seen much good result
from this interference of the parents, said
Lady Moseley, adhering to her opinions.
True; for to be of use, it should not be
seen, unless in extraordinary cases. You
will pardon me, Anne, but I have often
thought parents are generally in extremes;
either determined to make the election for
their children, or leaving them entirely to
their own flattered vanity and inexperience,
to govern not only their own lives, but I
may say, leave an impression on future
generations
.
And after all, what is this love?
nineteen cases in twenty of what we call
affairs of the heart would be better termed
affairs of the imagination.
And, is there not a great deal of
imagination
in all love? inquired Lady Moseley,
with a smile.
Undoubtedly there is some; but there is
one difference, which I take to be this: in
affairs of the imagination, the admired object
is gifted with all those qualities we esteem,
as a matter of course, and there is a certain
set of females who are ever ready to bestow
this admiration on any applicant for their
favours
,
who may not be strikingly
objectionable
;
the necessity of being courted, makes our
sex rather too much disposed to admire
improper
suitors.
But how do you distinguish affairs of the
heart, Charlotte?
Those in which the heart takes the lead
these generally follow from long intercourse,
or the opportunity of judging the real
character
and
are the only ones that are likely
to stand the test of worldly trials.
Suppose Emily to be the object of
Colonel
Egerton's pursuit, then, sister, in what
manner would you proceed to destroy the
influence I acknowledge he is gaining over
Jane?
I cannot suppose such a case, said Mrs.
Wilson, gravely, and then observing her
sister
to look, as if requiring an explanation, she
continued
My attention has been directed to the
forming of such principles, and such a taste,
if I may use the expression, under these
principles
,
that I feel no apprehension that Emily
will ever allow her affections to be ensnared
by a man of the evident opinions and views
of Colonel Egerton. I am impressed with a
two fold duty in watching the feelings of my
charge; she has so much singleness of heart,
such real strength of pure native feeling, that
should an improper man gain possession of
her affections, the struggle between her duty
and her love would be weighty indeed, but
should it have proceeded so far as to make it
her duty to love an unworthy object, I am
sure she would sink under it; but Jane would
only awake from a dream, and, for a while,
be wretched.
I thought you entertained a better
opinion
of Jane, sister, said Lady Moseley,
reproachfully.
I think her admirably calculated by
nature
to make an invaluable wife and mother;
but she is so much under the influence of her
fancy, that it is seldom she gives her heart an
opportunity of displaying its excellencies;
and again, she dwells so much upon
imaginary
perfections, that adulation has become
necessary to her. The man who flatters her
delicately, will be sure to win her esteem; and
every woman might then love the being
possessed
of the qualities she will not fail to
endow him with.
I do not know, that I rightly understand
how you would avert all these sad
consequences
of improvident affections? said
Lady Moseley.
Prevention is better than cureI would
first implant such opinions as would lessen
the danger of intercourse; and as for
particular
attentions from improper objects, it
should be my care to prevent them, by
prohibiting
,
or rather impeding, the intimacy
which might give rise to them. And, least
of all, said Mrs. Wilson, with a friendly
smile, as she rose to leave the room, would
I suffer a fear of being impolite to endanger
the happiness of a young woman entrusted
to my care.
CHAPTER VIII.
Francis, who laboured with the ardour of a
lover, under the influence of newly awakened
stimulus, soon completed the necessary
arrangements
and alterations in his new
parsonage
.
The living was a good one, and as
the rector was enabled to make a very
considerable
annual allowance from the private
fortune his wife had brought him, and as Sir
Edward had twenty thousand pounds in the
funds for each of his daughters, her portion of
which was immediately settled on Clara,
the youthful couple had not only a sufficient,
but an abundant provision for their station in
life; and they entered on their matrimonial
duties, with as great a prospect of happiness
as the ills of this world can give to health,
affection, and competency. Their union had
been deferred by Dr. Ives until his son was
established, with a view to keeping him under
his own direction during the critical period
of his first impressions in the priesthood;
and, as no objection now remained, or rather,
the only one he ever felt, was removed by
the proximity of Bolton to his own parish,
he united the lovers at the altar of the village
church, in the presence of his wife and Clara's
immediate relatives. On leaving the church,
Francis handed his bride into his own
carriage
,
which conveyed them to their new
residence
,
VOL. I. 7
amidst the good wishes of his
parishioners
,
and the prayers of their relatives for
their happiness. Dr. and Mrs. Ives retired
to the rectory, to the sober enjoyment of the
felicity of their only child; while the baronet
and his lady felt a gloom, that belied all the
wishes of the latter for the establishment of
their daughters. Jane and Emily had acted
as bridesmaids to their sister, and as both the
former and her mother had insisted there
should be two groomsmen as a counterpoise,
John was empowered with a carte-blanche
to make a provision accordingly; he at first
intimated his intention of calling on Mr.
Benfield in that capacity, but finally settled
down, to the no small mortification of the
before-mentioned ladies, into writing a note
to his kinsman, Lord Chatterton, whose
residence
was then in London, and who, in
reply
,
after expressing his sincere regret that an
accident would prevent his having the
pleasure
,
stated the intention of his mother and
two sisters to pay them an early visit of
congratulation
,
as soon as his own health would
allow of his attending them. This answer
arrived only the day preceding that fixed for
the wedding, and at the very moment they
were expecting his lordship in his proper
person.
There, cried Jane, in a kind of triumph,
I told you, you were silly in sending so far
on so sudden an occasion; now, after all,
what is to be done---it will be so awkward
when Clara's friends call to see herOh!
John, John, you are a Mar-plot.
Jenny, Jenny, you are a make-plot, said
John, as he coolly took up his hat to leave the
room.
Which way, my son? said the baronet,
as he met him on his own entrance.
To the deanery, sir, to try to get Captain
Jarvis to act as brides-maidI beg his
pardon
,
grooms-man, to-morrowChatterton has
been thrown from a horse, and can't come.
John!
Jenny!
I am sure, said Jane, indignation
glowing
in her countenance, that if Captain
Jarvis is to be an attendant, Clara must
excuse
my acting. I do not choose to be
associated
with Captain Jarvis.
John, said his mother, with dignity,
your trifling is unseasonable; certainly
Colonel Egerton is a more fitting person on
every account, and I desire, under present
circumstances, you ask the colonel.
Your ladyship's wishes are orders to
me, said John, gayly kissing his hand as he
left the room.
As the colonel was but too happy in having
it in his power to be of service in any
manner
,
to a gentleman he respected as much as
Mr. Francis Ives, he was the only person
present at the ceremony, who did not stand
within the bonds of consanguinity to either
of the partiesHe was invited by the baronet
to dine at the hall, and notwithstanding the
repeated injunctions of Mrs. Jarvis and her
daughters, to return to them immediately
with an account of the dress of the bride, and
other important items of a similar nature,
the colonel accepted the invitation. On
reaching the hall, Emily retired to her own
room, and on her entrance at dinner, the
paleness of her cheeks and redness of her
eyes, afforded sufficient proof, that the
translation
of a companion from her own to another
family, was an event, however happy in itself,
not unmingled with grief, to those who were
losers by the change. The day, however,
passed off tolerably well for those who are
expected to be happy, when in their hearts
they are really more disposed to weep than
to laugh. Jane and the colonel had most of
the conversation to themselves during dinner;
even the joyous and thoughtless John, wore
his gayety in a less graceful manner than usual,
and was observed by his aunt, to look with
moistened eyes at the vacant chair a servant
had, from habit, placed where Clara had been
accustomed to sit.
This beef is not done, Saunders, said
the baronet to his butler, or my appetite is
not as good as usual to-dayColonel Egerton,
will you allow me the pleasure of a glass of
sherry with you?
The wine was drank, and the beef
succeeded
by game; but still Sir Edward could
not eat.
How glad Clara will be to see us all the
day after to-morrow, said Mrs. Wilson;
your new house-keepers delight so in their
first efforts in entertaining their friends.
Lady Moseley smiled through her tears,
and turning to her husband, said, we will
go early, my dear, that we may see the
improvements
Francis has been making before
we dine; the baronet nodded assent, but his
heart was too full to speak; and apologising
to the colonel for his absence, on the plea of
some business with his people, left the
room.
The attentions of Colonel Egerton to both
mother and daughter were of the most
delicate
kind; he spoke of Clara, as if his
situation
as grooms-man to her husband, entitled
him to an interest in her welfarewith John
he was kind and sociable, and even Mrs.
Wilson
acknowledged, after he took his leave,
that he possessed a wonderful faculty of
making himself agreeable, and began to
think that, under all circumstances, he might
possibly prove as advantageous a connexion
as Jane could expect to form. Had any one
have proposed him as a husband for Emily,
her affection would have quickened her
judgment to a decision, true to the best, the
only interest of her chargethe rejection
of a man whose principles offered no security
for his conduct.
Soon after the baronet left the room, a
travelling carriage, with suitable attendants,
7*
drove to the door; the sound of the wheels
drew most of the company to a window
a baron's coronet, cried Jane, catching a
glimpse of the ornaments of the harness.
The Chattertons, echoed her brother,
as he left the room to meet themThe
mother of Sir Edward was a daughter of this
family, and sister to the grandfather of the
present lord. The connexion had always
been kept up with the show of cordiality
between
Sir Edward and his cousin, although
their manner of living and habits in common
were very different. The baron was a
courtier and a place-man; his estates, which
he could not alienate, produced about ten
thousand a year, but the income he could
and did spend; and the high perquisites of
his situation under government, amounting to
as much more, were melted away, year after
year, without making the provision for his
daughters, both his duty, and the observance
of his promise to his wife's father, required
at his hands. He had been dead a couple of
years, and his son found himself saddled with
the support of an unjointured mother and
unportioned
sisters. Money was not the idol
worshipped by the young lord, nor even
pleasure
;
he was affectionate to his surviving
parent
,
and his first act was to settle during his
own life, two thousand pounds a year upon
her, while he commenced setting aside as
much more for each of his sisters annually;
this abridged him greatly in his own
expenditures
,
yet as they made but one family, and
the dowager was really a
managing
woman
in more senses than one, they made a very
tolerable figure. The son was anxious to
follow the example of Sir Edward Moseley,
and give up his town house, for at least a
time, but his mother exclaimed with
something
like horror at the proposal.
Why Chatterton, would you give it up
at the moment it can be of the most use to
us? and she threw a glance at her daughters,
that would have discovered her policy to
Mrs. Wilson, but was lost on his lordship; he,
poor soul, thinking she meant it as
convenient
to support the interest he had been making
for the place held by his father; one of more
emolument than service or even honour. The
contending parties were so equally matched,
that the situation was kept as it were in
abeyance, waiting the arrival of some
newcomer
to the strength of one or other of the
claimantsthe interest of the peer had began
to lose ground at the period we speak of, and
his careful mother saw new motives for her
activity in providing for her children in the
lottery of life. Mrs. Wilson herself could not
be more vigilant in examining the candidates
for her daughter's favours, than was the
dowager
Lady Chattertonit is true, the task of
the former lady was by far the most arduous,
as it involved a study of character and
development
of principle, while that of the latter
would have been finished by the development
of a rent-rollprovided it contained five
figures in the sum total of its amount. Sir
Edward's was known to contain that number,
and two of them were not cyphers. Mr.
Benfield was rich, and John Moseley a very
agreeable young man; weddings are the
season
of love, thought the prudent dowager,
and Grace is extremely pretty. Chatterton,
who never refused his mother any thing in his
power to grant, and who was particularly
dutiful
,
when a visit to Moseley Hall was in the
question, suffered himself to be persuaded his
shoulder was well, and they left town the day
before the wedding, thinking to be in time
for all the gayeties, if not for the ceremony
itself.
There existed but little similarity between
the persons and manners of this young
nobleman and the baronet's heir. The beauty
of Chatterton was almost feminine; his
skin, his colour, his eyes, his teeth, were
such as many a belle had sighed after; and
his manners were bashful and retiring---yet
an intimacy had commenced between the
boys at school, which ripened into a
friendship
between the young men at college, and
had been maintained ever since, by a perfect
regard for each others dispositions, and
respect
for each others characters. With the
baron, John was more sedate than ordinary
with John, Chatterton found unusual
animation
.
But a secret charm, which John
held over the young peer, was his profound
respect and unvarying affection for his
youngest sister Emily; this was common
groundand no dreams of future happiness,
no visions of dawning wealth, crossed the
imagination of Chatterton, in which Emily
was not the Fairy to give birth to the one,
or the benevolent disponser of the hoards of
the other.
The arrival of this family, was a happy
relief from the oppression which hung on the
spirits of the Moseleys, and their reception,
marked with the mild benevolence which
belonged
to the nature of the baronet, and that
empressement of good breeding, which so
eminently distinguished the manners of his
wife.
The honourable Miss Chattertons were
both handsome; but the younger was, if
possible
,
a softened picture of her brotherthere
was the same retiring bashfulness, and the
same sweetness of temper as distinguished
the baron, and Grace was the peculiar
favourite
of Emily MoseleyNothing of the
strained or sentimental nature, which so often
characterise what is called female friendship,
had crept into the communications between
these young women. Emily loved her
sisters too well, to go out of her own family
for a repository of her griefs or a partaker in
her joys; had her life been checquered with
such passions, her own sisters were too near
her own age, to suffer her to think of a
confidence
,
to which the holy ties of natural
affection
did not give a claim to a participation in.
Mrs. Wilson had found it necessary, to give
her charge very differing views on many
subjects
,
from what Jane and Clara had been
suffered
to imbibe of themselves, but in no
degree
had she impaired the obligations of filial
piety or family concord. Emily was, if any
thing, more respectful to her parents, more
affectionate to her friends, than any of her
connexions; for in her the warmth of natural
feelings was heightened by an unvarying
sense of duty.
In Grace Chatterton she found, in many
respects, a temper and taste resembling her
own; she therefore loved her better than
others who had equal claims upon her
partiality
from ordinary associations, and as
such, she now received her with kindness and
affection.
In Catherine, Jane, who had not felt
satisfied
with the ordering of providence for the
disposal of her sympathies, and had felt a
restlessness that prompted her to look abroad
for a confiding spirit to communicate her
secrets she had none her delicacy would
suffer
her to revealbut to communicate the
crude opinions and reflections of her
ill-regulated
mind to. Catherine, however, had
not stood the test of trial. For a short time,
the love of heraldry had kept them together,
but Jane finding her companion's gusto limited
to the charms of the coronet and supporters
chiefly, abandoned the attempt in despair,
and was actually on the look-out for a new
candidate for the vacant station, as Colonel
Egerton came into the neighbourhooda
really delicate female mind, shrinks from the
exposure of its love to the other sex, and
Jane began to be less uneasy, to form a
connexion
,
which would either violate the
sensibility
of her nature, or lead to treachery to her
friend.
I regret extremely, my lady, said the
dowager, as they entered the drawing room,
the accident which befel Chatterton, should
have kept us until too late for the ceremony;
but we made it a point to hasten with our
congratulations, as soon as Astley Cooper
thought it safe for him to travel.
I feel indebted for your ladyship's
kindness
,
replied her smiling hostess; we are
always happy to have our friends around us,
and none more than yourself and family. We
were fortunate, however, in finding a friend
to supply your son's place, that the young
people might go to the altar in a proper
manner
Lady
Chatterton, allow me to present
our friend, Colonel Egertonand speaking
in a low tone, and with a manner of a little
consequence heir to Sir Edgar.
The colonel had bowed gracefully, and the
dowager dropped a hasty curtsey at the
commencement
of the speech; but a lower bend
followed the closing remark, and a glance of
the eye was thrown in quest of her
daughters
,
as if insensibly wishing to bring them
to their proper places.
CHAPTER IX.
The
following morning, Emily and Grace
declining the invitation to join the colonel
and John in their usual rides, walked to the
rectory, accompanied by Mrs. Wilson and
Chatterton. The ladies felt an irresistible
desire to mingle their anticipation of future
happiness to the new married couple, with
those most interested in them; and Francis
had promised his father to ride over in the
course of the day. Emily longed to inquire
after Clara, from whom she appeared already
to have been separated a month. Her
impatience
,
as they approached the house,
hurried
her on ahead of her companions, who
waited the more sober gait of her aunt. She
entered the parlour at the rectory without
meeting any one; glowing with the unusual
exercise of her speed, and her hair falling
over her shoulder, released from the
confinement
of the hat she had, oppressed with the
heat, thrown down hastily as she gained the
door. In the room there stood a gentleman
in deep black, with his back toward the
entrance
,
intent on a book he held in his hand,
and she concluded at once it was Francis.
Where is dear Clara, Frank? cried the
beautiful girl, laying her hand affectionately
on his shoulder; the gentleman turned
suddenly
,
and presented to her astonished gaze,
VOL. I. 8
the well-remembered countenance of the
young man whose parent's death would never
be forgotten at B.
I thoughtI thought, sir, said Emily,
almost sinking with confusion, Mr. Francis
Ives
Your brother has not yet arrived, Miss
Moseley, replied the stranger, in a voice of
peculiar tones, and the manner of a perfect
gentlemanI will acquaint Mrs. Ives with
your visit; and bowing, he delicately left
the room.
Emily, who felt insensibly relieved by his
manner, and the nice allusion to her
connexion
with Francis, as explaining her
familiarity
immediately
restored her hair to its
proper bounds, and had recovered her
composure
by the time her aunt and friends
joined hershe hastily mentioned the
incident
,
laughing at her own precipitation, when
Mrs. Ives came into the room.
Chatterton and his sister were both known
to her, and both favourites; she was pleased
to see them, and after reproaching the brother
with compelling her son to ask a favour of a
comparative stranger, she smilingly turned to
Emily, and said
You found the parlour occupied, I
believe
?
Yes, said Emily, laughing and blushing,
I suppose Mr. Denbigh told you of my
heedlessness.
He told me of your attention in calling
so soon to inquire after Clara, but said nothing
more-and a servant telling her Francis wished
to see her, she excused herself and withdrew.
In the door she met Mr. Denbigh, who made
way for her, saying, your son has arrived,
madam, and in an easy, but respectful
manner
,
took his place with the guests, no
introduction
passed, and none seemed necessary;
his misfortunes appeared to have made him
acquainted with Mrs. Wilson, and his
strikingly
ingenuous manner, won insensibly on the
confidence of those who heard him. Every
thing was natural, yet every thing was
softened by education; and the little party in
the rector's parlour, in fifteen minutes, felt as
if they had known him for years. The
doctor
and his son now joined themClara was
looking forward in delightful expectation of
to-morrow, and wished greatly for Emily as
a guest at her new abode. This pleasure
Mrs. Wilson promised she should have as
soon as they had got over the hurry of their
visit. our friends, she added, turning to
Grace, will overlook the nicer punctilios
of ceremony, where sisterly regard calls
for the discharge of more important
duties
.
Clara needs the society of Emily just
now.
Certainly, said Grace, mildly, I hope no
useless ceremony on the part of Emily would
prevent her manifesting her natural
attachment
to her sisterI should feel hurt at her
not entertaining a better opinion of us than to
suppose so for a moment.
This, young ladies, is the real feeling to
keep alive esteem, cried the doctor, gayly;
go on, and say and do nothing that either
can disapprove of, when tested by the
standard
of duty, and you need never be afraid of
losing a friend that is worth the keeping.
The removal of a young woman from
her own home to that of her husband, must
give birth to many melancholy reflections,
observed Denbigh to Francis, with a smile,
and the subject was dropped.
It was three o'clock before the carriage of
Mrs. Wilson, which had been directed to
come for them, arrived at the rectory; and
the time had stolen away insensibly in free
and friendly communications between the
doctor's guests and his wife, for he himself
had returned with his son to dine at Bolton
some time previously. Denbigh had joined
modestly, and with the degree of interest a
stranger could be supposed to feel, in the
occurrences
of a circle he was nearly a stranger
to; there was at times a slight display of
awkwardness, both about himself and Mrs.
Ives, for which Mrs. Wilson easily accounted
by the recollections of his recent loss, and the
scene that very room had witnessed; but
which escaped the notice of the rest of the
party. On the arrival of the carriage, Mrs.
Wilson took her leave.
I like this Mr. Denbigh greatly, said
Lord Chatterton, as they drove from the
door, there is something strikingly pleasing
in his manner.
Ay, my lord, and in his matter too,
judging
of the little we have seen of him,
replied
Mrs. Wilson.
Who is he, madam?
Why, I rather suspect he is some way
related to Mrs. Ives; her staying from Bolton
to-day, must be owing to Mr. Denbigh, and
as the doctor has gone, he must be just near
enough to them, neither to be wholly
neglected
,
or a tax upon their politeness; I rather
wonder he did not go with them.
I heard him tell Francis, said Emily,
he would not think of intruding, and he
insisted
on Mrs. Ives going, but she had
employment
to keep her at home.
The carriage soon reached an angle in the
road where the highways between Bolton
Castle and Moseley Hall intersected each
other, and on the estate of the former. Mrs.
Wilson stopped a moment to inquire after an
aged pensioner of her's, who had lately met
with a loss in his business, she was fearful
must have distressed him greatly. In
crossing
a ford in the little river between his
cottage
and the market-town, the stream, which
had been unexpectedly higher than usual by
heavy rains above, had swept away his horse
and cart, loaded with the entire produce of
his small field---with much difficulty he had
saved his own life. Mrs. Wilson had it not
8*
until now in her power to inquire particularly
into the affair, and offer that relief she felt
ever ready to bestow on proper objects.
Contrary
to her expectations, she found
Humphreys
in high spirits, showing his delighted
grand-children a new cart and horse which
stood at his door, as he pointed out the
excellent
qualities of both. He ceased on the
approach of his benefactress on so many
former occasions, and, at her request, gave a
particular account of the affair.
And where did you get the new cart and
horse, Humphreys? inquired Mrs. Wilson,
when he had ended.
Oh, madam, I went up to the castle to
see the steward, and Mr. Martin just
mentioned
my loss to Lord Pendennyss, ma'am,
and my lord ordered me this cart, madam,
and this noble horse, and twenty golden
guineas
into the bargain, to put me upon my legs
again---God bless him for it for ever.
It was very kind of his lordship,
indeed
,
said Mrs. Wilson, thoughtfully, I did
not know he was at the castle.
He's gone, madam; the servants told me,
he called to see the earl, on his way to
Lonnon
,
but finding he'd went a few days agone
to Ireland, my lord went for Lonnon,
without
stopping the night even. Ah! madam,
continued the old man, as he stood leaning on
his stick, with his hat in his hand, he's a
great blessing to the poor; his servants say
he gives thousands every year to the poor
who are in want---he is main rich, too, some
people say, much richer and more great like
than the earl himself. I'm sure I have need
to bless him every day of my life.
Mrs. Wilson smiled mournfully, as she
wished Humphreys good day, and put up
her purse, on finding the old man so well
provided for; a display, or competition in
charity, never entering into her system of
benevolence
.
His lordship is munificent in his bounty,
said Emily, as they drove from the door.
Does it not savour of thoughtlessness, to
bestow so much where he can know so
little
?
Lord Chatterton ventured to inquire.
He is, replied Mrs. Wilson, as old
Humphrey says, main rich; but the son of
the old man, and father of these children, is
a soldier in the th dragoons, of which
the earl is colonel, and that accounts to me
for the liberality of the donation,
recollecting
,
with a sigh, the feelings which had
drawn herself out of the usual circles of her
charities, in the case of the same man.
Did you ever see the earl, aunt?
inquired
Emily, gently.
Never, my dear; he has been much
abroad, but my letters were filled with his
praises, and I confess my disappointment is
great in not seeing him in this visit to Lord
Bolton, who is his relation; but, fixing her
eyes thoughtfully on her niece, we shall
meet in London this winter, I trust. As
she spoke, a cloud passed over her
features
,
and she continued much absorbed in
thought, for the remainder of their ride.
General Wilson had been a cavalry officer,
and commanded the same regiment now held
by Lord Pendennyss; in an excursion near
the British camp, he had been rescued from
captivity, if not from death, by a gallant and
timely interference of this young nobleman,
then in command of a troop in the same
corps. He had mentioned the occurrence
to his wife in his letters, and from that day,
his correspondence was filled with his praises
his braveryhis goodness to the soldiery
and when he fell, he had been supported from
the field, and died in the arms of his
youthful
friend. A letter announcing his death, had
been received by his widow from the earl,
and the tenderness and affectionate
manner
of speaking of her husband, had taken a
deep hold on her affectionsAll the
circumstances
together, had thrown an interest
around him that had made Mrs. Wilson
almost
entertain the romantic wish he might
be found worthy of, and disposed to solicit
the hand of her Emily. Her inquiries into his
character had been attended with such
answers
as flattered her wishes; but the service
of the earl, or his private affairs, had never
allowed a meeting; and she was now
compelled
to look forward to what John,
laughingly
termed, their winter campaign, as the
only probable place where she could be
gratified with the sight of a young man to
whom she owed so much, and whose image
was connected with some of the most
tender
,
although most melancholy recollections
of her life.
Colonel Egerton, who now appeared
almost
domesticated in the family, was again
of the party at dinner, to the no small
satisfaction
of the dowager, who, from proper
inquiries
in the course of the day, had learnt
that Sir Edgar's heir was likely to have the
necessary number of figures in the sum total
of his revenue. While sitting in the
drawing-room
that afternoon, she made an attempt to
bring her eldest daughter and the elegant
soldier
together over a chess-board; a game,
the young lady had been required to learn,
because it was one at which a gentleman could
be kept longer than any other without having
his attention drawn away by any of those
straggling charms, which might be travelling
a drawing-room, seeking whom they may
devour. It was also a game admirably suited
to the display of a beautiful hand and arm;
but the abilities of the mother had for a long
time been staggered with discovering a way
of bringing in the foot also. In vain her
daughter hinted at dancing, an amusement
she was passionately fond of, as the proper
theatre for this exhibition. The wary mother
knew too well the effects of concentrated
force to leave it out of the combat. After a
great deal of
experimentizing
in her own
person, she endeavoured to correct Catherine
for her manner of sitting, and by dint of
twisting and turning, she contrived that her
pretty foot and ancle should be thrown
forward
in such a way, that the eye dropping
from the move, should rest on this beauteous
object; thus giving, as it were, a Scylla and
Charybdis to her daughter's charms.
John Moseley was the first person she
undertook
to try the effect of her invention
upon a few months before; and after
comfortably
seating the parties, she withdrew to
a little distance, to watch the effect.
Check to your king, Miss Chatterton,
cried John, early in the gameand the young
lady thrust out her footcheck to your
king, Mr. Moseley, echoed the damsel, in
triumph, and John's eyes wandered from
hand to foot, and foot to hand. Check
king and queen, sir,Check mate,
did you speak? said John, and looking up
he caught the eye of the dowager fixed on
him in triumphOh ho, said the young
man, internally, mother Chatterton, are you
there, and coolly taking up his hat he
walked off, nor could they ever get him
seated again.
You beat me too easily, Miss
Chatterton
,
he would say, when pressed to play,
before I have time to look up, it's
checkmate
excuse
meand the dowager settled
down into a more covert attack, through
Gracebut here she had two to contend
withher own forces rebelled; and the war
had been protracted to the present hour,
with varied success, and no material
captures
,
at least on one side.
Colonel Egerton entered on the duties of
his dangerous undertaking, with all the
indifference
of fool-hardiness; and the game
was played with tolerable ability by either
party; but no emotions, no absence of mind
could be discovered on the part of the
gentlemanfeet and hands were in motion,
still the colonel played as well as usual
he had answers for all Jane's questions,
and smiles for his partner; but no
checkmate
could she obtain, until wilfully
throwing
away an advantage, he suffered the lady
to win the gameand the dowager was
satisfied nothing could be done with the
colonel.
CHAPTER X.
The first carriages that rolled over the
lawn to Bolton parsonage, on the
succeeding
day, were those of the baronet and
his sisterthe latter in advance.
There, Francis, cried Emily, as she
impatiently
waited his removing some slight
obstruction to her alighting, thank you,
thank you, that will do, and in the next
moment she was in the extended arms of
Clara; after pressing each other to their
bosoms
for a few moments in silence, Emily
looked up, with a tear glistening in her eye,
and first noticed the form of Denbigh,
modestly
withdrawing, as if unwilling to intrude
on such pure and domestic feelings as the
sisters exposed, unconscious of a witness
her aunt and Jane, followed by Miss
Chatterton
,
now entered, and cordial salutes and
greetings flowed upon Clara from her various
friends.
The baronet's coach had reached the door;
in it were himself and wife, Mr. Benfield, and
Lady ChattertonClara stood on the portico
of the building ready to receive them, her
face all smiles, and tears, and blushes, and her
arm locked in that of Emily.
I wish you joy of your new abode, Mrs.
Francis---Lady Mosely forgot her form, and
bursting into tears, pressed her with ardour to
her bosom.
Clara, my love, said the baronet, hastily
wiping his eyes, and succeeding his wife in
the embrace of their childhe kissed her and
pressing Francis by the hand, walked into
the house in silence.
Wellwell, cried the dowager, as she
saluted her cousin, all looks comfortable
and genteel here, upon my word Mrs. Ives;
graperyhot-housesevery thing in good
order too, and Sir Edward tells me the living
is worth a good five hundred a-year.
So, girl, I suppose you expect a kiss,
said Mr. Benfield, as he ascended the steps
slowly, to the entrancekissing has gone
much out of fashion lately; I remember, on
the marriage of my friend, Lord Gosford, in
the year fifty-eight, that all the maids and
attendants were properly saluted in order.
The lady Juliana was quite young then, not
more than fifteen, it was there I got my first
salute from herbut sokiss me, and he
continued as they went into the house,
marrying in that day was a serious
business
;
you might visit a lady a dozen times,
before you could get a sight of her naked
handwho's that? stopping short, and
looking
earnestly at Denbigh, who now
approached
them.
Mr. Denbigh, sir, said Clara, and
turning
,
VOL. I. 9
she observed to Denbigh, my uncle,
Mr. Benfield.
Did you ever know, sir, a gentleman of
your name, who sat in the parliament of this
realm in the year sixty? said Mr. Benfield;
and then, turning an inquiring look on the
figure of the young man, he added, you
don't look much like him.
That is rather before my day, sir, said
Denbigh, with a smile, and respectfully
offering
to relieve Clara, who supported him on
one side, while Emily held his arm on the
other. The old gentleman was particularly
averse to strangers, and Emily was in terror,
lest he should say something rudebut after
examining Denbigh again, from head to foot,
he took the offered arm, and replied by
saying
True, true, that was sixty years ago;
you can hardly recollect so longah! Mr.
Denbigh, times are sadly altered since my
youth: people who were then glad to ride on
a pillion, now drive their coaches; men who
thought ale a luxury, now drink their port;
aye! and those who went bare-foot, must
have their shoes and stockings too. Luxury,
sir, and the love of ease, will ruin this mighty
empire; corruption has taken hold of every
thing; the ministry buy the members, the
members buy the ministry---every thing is
bought and sold; now, sir, in the parliament
I had a seat, there was a knot of us, as
upright
as posts, sir; my Lord Gosford was one,
and General Denbigh was another, although
I can't say I always liked his ways; how
was he related to you, sir?
He was my grandfather, replied
Denbigh
,
with a benevolent smile, and looking at
Emily. Had the old man continued his
speech an hour longer, Denbigh would not
have complained; he had stopped while
talking
,
and thus confronted him with the
beautiful
figure that supported his left arm.
Denbigh
had contemplated in admiration, the
varying countenance, which now blushed
with apprehension, and now smiled in
affection
,
or with an archer expression, as her
uncle proceeded in his harangue on the
times; but all felicity in this world has an
end as well as misery; Denbigh retained
the recollection of that speech, long after
Mr. Benfield was comfortably seated in the
parlour, though for his life he could not
recollect
a word he had said.
The Haughtons, the Jarvises, and a few
others of their intimate acquaintances, now
arrived, and the parsonage had the air of a
busy scene; but John, who had undertaken
to drive Grace Chatterton in his own
phaeton
,
was yet absent; some little anxiety had
begun to be manifested; when he appeared,
dashing through the gates at a great rate, and
with the skill of a member of the
four-in-hand
.
Lady Chatterton had begun to be seriously
uneasy, and was about to speak to her son to
go in quest of them, as they came in sight;
but now her fears vanished, and she could
only suppose, that a desire to have Grace
alone, could keep him so late, whose horses
were so evidently fleet; accordingly she met
them in great spirits, with
Upon my word, Mr. Moseley, I began
to think you had taken the road to
Scotland
with my daughter, you staid so long.
Your daughter, my Lady Chatterton,
said John, cooly, would neither go to
Scotland
with me, or any other man, or I am
deceived
in her characterClara, my sister,
how do you do, and he saluted the bride
with great warmth.
But what detained you, Moseley?
inquired
his mother.
One of the horses was restive, and broke
the harness, and I stopped in the village
while it was mended.
And how did Grace behave? asked
Emily, laughing.
Oh, a thousand times better than you
would, sister; and as she always does, like an
angel, said John, with fervour.
The only point in dispute between Emily
and her brother, was her want of faith in
his driving; while poor Grace, naturally timid,
and unwilling to oppose, particularly the
gentleman
who then held the reins, had governed
herself sufficiently to be silent and
motionless
;
indeed, she could hardly do otherwise
had she wished it; and John felt flattered to
a degree, that, aided by the merit, the beauty,
and the delicacy of the young lady herself,
might have led to the very results her mother
so anxiously wished to produce. But
managers
too often overdo their work. Grace
is
a good girl, said her mother; and you
found her very valiant, Mr. Moseley? Oh,
as brave as Csar, answered John,
carelessly
,
and in a way that proved he was
ironical
.
Grace, whose burning cheeks showed
but too plainly, that praise from John
Moseley
was an incense too powerful for her
resistance
,
now sunk back behind some of the
company, endeavouring to conceal the tears
that almost gushed from her eyes; as
Denbigh
,
who had been a silent spectator of the
whole scene, observed, that he had seen an
improvement which would obviate the
difficulty
Mr. Moseley had experienced; John
turned to the speaker, and was about to reply,
for he had heard of his being at the rectory
the day before, as the tilbury of Colonel
Egerton drove to the door, containing
himself
and his friend the captain.
The bride undoubtedly received
congratulations
on that day, more sincere than what
were now offered, but none were delivered
in a more graceful and insinuating manner
than those from Colonel Egerton; he
passed
round the room, speaking to his
acquaintances
,
until he arrived at the chair
of Jane, who was seated next her aunt;
here he stopped, and glancing his eye round,
9*
and saluting with bows and smiles the
remainder
of the party, appeared fixed at the
centre of all attraction to him. There is a
gentleman I have never seen before, he
observed
to Mrs. Wilson, casting his eyes on
Denbigh, whose back was towards him in
discourse with Mr. Benfield.
Yes, it is Mr. Denbigh, of whom you
heard us speak, replied Mrs. Wilson; and
while she spoke, Denbigh faced them
Egerton
started as he caught a view of his face,
and seemed to gaze on the countenance,
which was open to his inspection, with an
earnestness that showed an interest of some
kind, but such as was inexplicable to Mrs.
Wilson, the only observer of this singular
recognition
,
for such it evidently was; all was
natural in the colonelfor the moment, his
colour sensibly changed, and there was
a peculiar expression in his face; it might be
fear, it might be horror, it might be a strong
aversion---it clearly was not love; Emily sat
by her aunt, and Denbigh approached them,
making a cheerful remark; it was impossible
for the colonel and him to avoid each other,
had they wished it; and Mrs. Wilson thought
she would try the experiment of an
introduction
Colonel
EgertonMr. Denbigh;
both gentlemen bowed, but nothing striking
was seen in the deportment of either, when
the colonel, who was not exactly at ease, said
hastily,
Mr. Denbigh is, or has been, in the army
too, I believe.
Denbigh now started in his turn; he cast a
look on Egerton of fixed and settled
meaning
;
and said carelessly, but still as if
requiring
an answer,
I am, sir, yet; but do not recollect
having the pleasure of seeing Colonel
Egerton
in the service.
Your countenance is familiar, sir,
replied
the colonel, carelessly, but at this
moment
,
I cannot tax my memory with the
place of our meeting, and he changed the
discourse. It was some time, however,
before
either gentleman recovered his ease, and
many days elapsed ere any thing like
intercourse
passed between them; the colonel
attached himself during this visit to Jane,
with occasional notices of the Miss Jarvises,
who began to manifest symptoms of
uneasiness
,
at the decided preference he showed to
a lady they now chose to look upon, in some
measure, as a rival.
Mrs. Wilson and her charge were, on the
other hand, entertained by the conversations
of Chatterton and Denbigh, with occasional
sallies from the lively John. There was
something in the person and manner of
Denbigh
,
that insensibly attracted towards him
those whom fortune threw in his way. His
face was not strikingly handsome, but it was
noble; and when he smiled, or was much
animated
with any emotion, it did not fail
invariably
to communicate a spark of his own
enthusiasm to the beholder; his figure was
faultlesshis air and manner, if less easy
than that of Colonel Egerton, was more
sincere
and ingenuous, his breeding clearly
high, and his respect rather bordering on the
old school; but in his voice there existed a
charm, which would make him, when he
spoke of love that he felt, to a female ear,
almost resistless; it was soft, deep,
melodious
.
Baronet, said the rector, with a smile
on his son and daughter-in-law, I love to
see my children happy, and Mrs. Ives
threatens a divorce, if I go on in the manner
I have commenced; she says I desert her for
Bolton.
Why, doctor, if our wives conspire against
us, and prevent our enjoying a comfortable
dish of tea with Clara, or a glass of wine
with Frank, we must call in the higher
authorities as umpires--what say you, sister;
is a parent to desert his child in any case?
My opinion is, said Mrs. Wilson, with
a smile, yet speaking with emphasis, that a
parent is
not
to desert a child, in any case,
or in any manner.
Do you hear that, my Lady Moseley,
cried the baronet, good humouredly.
Do you hear that, my Lady
Chatterton
,
cried John, who had just taken a
seat by Grace, as her mother approached
them.
I hear it, but do not see the application,
Mr. Moseley.
No, my lady! why there is the
honourable
Miss Chatterton, almost dying to play a
game of her favourite chess with Mr.
Denbigh
;
she has beat us all but him, you
know.
And as Denbigh politely offered to meet
the challenge, the board was produced; and
the lady attended, with a view, however, to
prevent any of those consequences she was
generally fond of seeing result from this
amusement; every measure taken by this
prudent mother, being literally governed by
judicious
calculation--
Well, thought John,
as he viewed the players, while listening with
pleasure to the opinions of Grace, who had
recovered her composure and spirits; Kate
has played one game without using her
feet.
CHAPTER XI.
Ten
days or a fortnight now flew swiftly
by, during which, Mrs. Wilson suffered Emily
to give Clara a week, having first
ascertained
that Denbigh was a settled resident
at the rectory, and thereby not likely to
be oftener at the house of Francis than at the
hall, where he was a frequent and welcome
guest, both on his own account, and as a
friend of Doctor Ives---Emily had returned,
and brought the bride and groom with her;
when, one evening as they were pleasantly
seated at their various amusements, with the
ease of old acquaintances, Mr. Haughton
entered, at an hour rather unusual for his
visits; throwing down his hat, after making
the usual inquiries, he began,
I know, good people, you are all
wondering
what has brought me out this time of
night, but the truth is, Lucy has coaxed her
mother to persuade me into a ball, in honour
of the times; so, my lady, I have consented,
and my wife and daughter have been buying
up all the finery in B, by the way, I
suppose
,
of anticipating their friends. There is a
regiment of foot come into the barracks,
within fifteen miles of us, and to-morrow I
must beat up for recruits among the officers
---girls are never wanting on such
occasions
.
Why, cried the baronet, you are
growing
young again, my friend.
No, Sir Edward, but my daughter is
young, and life has so many cares, that I am
willing she should get rid of as many as she
can now, at my expense.
Surely, you would not wish her to
dance them away, said Mrs. Wilson;
such relief, I am afraid, will prove
temporary
.
Do you disapprove of dancing, ma'am?
said Mr. Haughton, who held her opinions in
great respect, and some little dread.
I neither approve or disapprove of it---
jumping up and down, is innocent enough in
itself, and if it must be done, it is well it
were done gracefully; as for the
accompaniments
of dancing I say nothing---what do
you say, Doctor Ives?
To what, my dear madam?
To dancing.
Oh! let the girls dance, if they enjoy it.
I am glad you think so, doctor, cried
Mr. Haughton; I had thought I recollected
your advising your son, never to dance or
play at games of chance.
You thought right, my friend, said the
doctor, laying down his newspaper; I gave
that advice to Frank---I do not object to
dancing as innocent in itself, and as elegant
exercise, but it is like drinking, generally
carried
to excess; and as a Christian, I am
opposed
to all excesses; the music and company
lead to intemperance in the recreation, and
it often induces neglect of duties---but so
may any thing else.
I like a game of whist, doctor, greatly,
said Mr. Haughton, but observing you
never play, and recollecting your advice to
Mr. Francis, I have forbidden cards when
you are my guest.
I thank you for the compliment, good
sir, replied the doctor, with a smile; but I
would much rather see you play cards, than
hear you talk scandal, as you sometimes
do.
Scandal, echoed Mr. Haughton.
Ay, scandal, said the doctor, coolly,
such as your own remark, the last time,
which was yesterday, I called to see you---
that Sir Edward was wrong in letting that
poacher off so easily as he did; the baronet,
you said, did not shoot himself, and did not
know how to prize game as he ought.
Scandal, doctordo you call that
scandal
;
why, I told Sir Edward so himself, two
or three times.
I know you have, and that was rude.
Rude! I hope, sincerely, Sir Edward
has put no such construction on it; and the
baronet smiled kindly, and shook his head.
Because the baronet chooses to forgive
your offences, it does not alter their nature,
said the doctor, gravely; no, you must
repent
and amend; you impeached his motives
for doing a benevolent act, and that I call
scandal.
Why, doctor, I was angry the fellow
should be let loose; he is a pest to all the
game in the county, and every sportsman will
tell you so---here, Mr. Moseley, you know
Jackson, the poacher.
Oh! a poacher is an intolerable wretch,
cried Captain Jarvis.
Oh! a poacher, cried John, with a droll
look at Emily, hang all poachers.
Poacher, or no poacher, does not alter
the scandal, said the doctor; now let me
tell you, good sir, I would rather play at
fifty games of whist, than make one such
speech, unless, indeed, it interfered with
my duties---now, sir, with your leave,
I'll explain myself, as to my son---There is
an artificial levity about dancing, that adds to
the dignity of no man; from some it may
detract: a clergyman, for instance, is
supposed
to have other things to do, and it would
hurt him in the opinions of those his
influence
is necessary with, and impair his
usefulness
;
therefore clergymen should never
dance---In the same way with cards; they
are the common instruments of gambling,
and an odium attached to them, on that
account
;
women and clergymen must respect
the prejudices of mankind, in some cases, or
hurt their influence in society.
I did hope to have the pleasure of your
company, doctor, said Mr. Haughton,
hesitatingly
.
VOL. 1. 10
And if it will give you pleasure, cried
the rector, you shall have it, my good
friend; it would be a greater evil to wound
the feelings of such a neighbour as Mr.
Haughton, than to show my face once at a
ball---as innocent as your's will be; and
rising, he laid his hand on his shoulder
kindly
.
Both your scandal and rudeness are
easily forgiven; but I wished to show you
the common error of the world---that has
attached odium to certain things, while it
charitably overlooks others of a more heinous
nature.
Mr. Haughton, who had at first been a
little staggered with the attack of the doctor,
recovered himself, with the view of his
object
,
and laying a handful of notes on the
table, hoped he should have the pleasure of
seeing them all; the invitation was generally
accepted, and the worthy man departed,
happy if his friends did but come, and were
pleased.
Do you dance, Miss Moseley, inquired
Denbigh of Emily, as he sat watching her
graceful movements in netting a purse for her
father.
Oh yes! the doctor said nothing of us
girls, you know; I suppose he thinks we
have no dignity to lose, replied Emily, with
a playful smile, and stealing a look at the
rector.
Admonitions are generally thrown away
on young ladies, when pleasure is in the
question, said the doctor, overhearing her
as she intended, and with a look of almost
paternal affection.
I hope you do not seriously disapprove
of it, in moderation, said Mrs. Wilson.
That depends, madam, upon
circumstances
greatly; if it is to be made subsidiary
to envy, malice, coquetry, vanity, or any
other such little, lady-like accomplishment,
replied the doctor, good-homouredly, it
certainly had better be let alone---but in
moderation
,
and with the feelings of my little
pet here, I should be cynical, indeed, to
object
.
Denbigh appeared lost in his own
ruminations
during this little dialogue; and as the
doctor ended, he turned to the captain, who
was overlooking a game of chess, between
the colonel and Jane, of which the latter had
become remarkably fond of late, and played
with her hands and eyes, instead of her feet,
and inquired the name of the corps, in
barracks
at F; theth foot, sir,
replied
the captain, haughtily, who neither
respected
him, owing to his want of
consequence
,
or loved him, from the manner Emily
listened to his conversation.
Will Miss Moseley forgive a bold
request
I have to urge, said Denbigh, with
some hesitation.
Emily looked up from her work in silence,
but with some little flutterings at the heart,
occasioned
by his peculiar manner--the honour
of her hand for the first dance, said
Denbigh
,
observing her in expectation he would
proceed.
Emily laughingly said, certainly, Mr.
Denbigh, if you can submit to the
degradation
.
The London papers now came in, and
most of the gentlemen sat down to their
perusal
.
The colonel, however, replaced the men
for a second game, and Denbigh still kept
his place beside Mrs. Wilson and her niece.
The manners, the sentiments, the whole
exterior
of this gentleman, were such as both the
taste and judgment approved of--his
qualities
were those which insensibly gained on
the heart, and Mrs. Wilson noticed, with a
slight uneasiness, the very evident satisfaction
her niece took in his society---In Dr. Ives
she had great confidence, yet Dr. Ives was a
friend, and probably judged him favourably;
and again, Dr. Ives was not to suppose, he
was introducing a candidate for the hand of
Emily, in every gentleman he brought to the
hall; Mrs. Wilson had seen too often the ill
consequences of trusting to impressions
received
from inferences of companionship,
not to know, the only safe way was to judge
for ourselves; the opinions of others might
be partialmight be prejudicedand many
an improper connexion had been formed, by
listening to the sentiments of those who
spoke without interest, and consequently
without examination; not a few matches
are made by this idle commendation of
others, uttered by lips that command
respect from a reputation for intelligence,
and which are probably suggested by a
desire
to please the very listener who hears
them. In short, Mrs. Wilson knew, that as
our happiness chiefly interested ourselves, so
it was to ourselves, or to those few whose
interest
was equal to our own, we could only
trust those important inquiries, necessary to
establish a permanent opinion of good or
evil in a character. With Doctor Ives her
communications on subjects of duty were
frequent and confiding, and although she
sometimes thought his benevolence disposed
him to be rather too lenient to the faults of
mankind, she entertained a profound respect
for his judgment; it was very influential with
her, if it were not always conclusive; she
determined
,
therefore, to have an early
conversation
with him on the subject so near her
heart, and be in a great measure regulated
by his answers, in the immediate steps to be
taken. Every day gave her, what she
thought, melancholy proof of the ill
consequences
of neglecting our dutyin the
increasing
intimacy of Colonel Egerton and
Jane.
Here, aunt, cried John, as he ran over
a paper, is a paragraph relating to your
favourite youth, our trusty and well beloved
cousin, the Earl of Pendennyss.
10*
Read it, said Mrs. Wilson, with an
interest
his name never failed to excite.
We noticed to day the equipage of the
gallant Lord Pendennyss before the gates of
Annandale-house, and understand the noble
Earl is last from Bolton castle,
Northamptonshire
.
A very important fact, said Captain
Jarvis sarcastically; Colonel Egerton and
myself got as far as the village, to pay our
respects
to him, when we heard he had gone
on to town.
The earl's character, both as a man
and a soldier, observed the colonel, gives
him a claim to our attentions, that his rank
would not; it was on that account we would
have called.
Brother, said Mrs. Wilson, you would
oblige me greatly, by asking his lordship to
waive ceremony; his visits to Bolton castle
will probably be frequent, now we have
peace; and the owner is so much from home,
that we may never see him without some
such invitation.
Do you want him as a husband for
Emily? cried John, as he gaily seated
himself
by the side of his sister.
Mrs. Wilson smiled at an observation,
which reminded her of one of her romantic
wishes; and, as she raised her head to reply,
in the same tone, met the eye of Denbigh
fixed on her, with an expression that kept her
silent: this is really an incomprehensible
young man in some respects, thought the
cautious widow, his startling looks on the
introduction to the colonel, crossing her
mind at the same time; and observing the
doctor opening the door that led to the
baronet's library, Mrs. Wilson, who acted
generally as soon as she had decided,
followed
him in silence. As their conversations
were known often to relate to little offices of
charity they both delighted in, the
movement
excited no surprise, and she entered
the library with the doctor, uninterrupted by
any one else.
Doctor, said Mrs. Wilson, impatient to
proceed to the point, you know my maxim,
prevention is better than cure: this young
friend of yours is very interesting.
Do you feel yourself in danger? said
the rector, smiling.
Not very imminent, replied the lady,
laughing good naturedly; and seating herself,
she continued, who is he? and who was
his father, if I may ask?
George Denbigh, Madam, both father
and son, said the doctor gravely.
Ah, doctor, I am almost tempted to wish
Frank had been a girl; you know what I
wish to learn.
Put your questions in order, dear
Madam
,
said the doctor, in a kind manner,
and they shall be answered.
His principles?
So far as I can learn, they are good
his acts, as they have come to my notice,
are highly meritorious, and I hope
originated
in proper motives; I have seen but
little of him of late years, however, and on
this head, you are nearly as good a judge as
myself; his filial piety, said the doctor,
dashing a tear from his eye, and speaking
with fervour, was lovely.
His temperhis disposition.
His temper is under great command,
although naturally ardent; his disposition
eminently benevolent towards his
fellow-creatures
.
His connexions.
Suitable, said the doctor with a smile.
His fortune was of but little moment;
Emily would be amply provided, for all the
customary necessaries of her station; and
Mrs. Wilson thanking the divine, returned
to the parlour, easy in her mind, and
determined
to let things take their own course for
a time, but in no degree to relax the
vigilance
of her observation.
On her return to the room, Mrs. Wilson
observed Denbigh approach Egerton, and
enter into conversation of a general
nature
;
it was the first time any thing more
than unavoidable courtesies had passed
between
them, and the colonel appeared
slightly
uneasy under his situation; while, on the
other hand, his companion showed an
anxiety
to be on a more friendly footing than
heretoforethere was something mysterious
in the feelings manifested by both these
gentlemen, that greatly puzzled the good
lady to account for; and from its
complexion
,
she feared one or the other was not
entirely
free from censure; it could not have
been a quarrel, or their names would have
been familiar to each other; they had both
served in Spain she knew, and excesses were
often committed by gentlemen at a distance
from home, their pride would have
prevented
where they were anxious to maintain a
character. Gambling, and a few other
prominent
vices, floated through her
imagination
,
until wearied of conjectures where
she had no data from which to discover the
truth, and supposing after all it might be
her imagination only, she turned to more
pleasant reflections.
CHAPTER XII.
The
bright eyes of Emily Moseley,
unconsciously
wandered round the brilliant
assemblage at Mr. Haughton's, as she took
her seat, in search of her partner. The
rooms were filled with scarlet coats, and
belles from the little town of F, and if
the company were not the most select
imaginable
,
it was disposed to enjoy the passing
moment cheerfully, and in lightness of heart;
as their good hearted host would sing, to
dance away care:e'er, however, she could
make out to scan the countenances of the
beaux, young Jarvis, decked in the full
robes of his dignity, as captain in the
foot, approached and solicited the honour of
her hand; the colonel had already secured
her sister, and it was by the instigation of
his friend, Jarvis had been thus early in his
application; Emily thanked him, and
pleaded
her engagement; the mortified youth, who
had thought dancing with the ladies a favour
conferred on them, from the anxiety his
sisters
always manifested to get partners; stood
for a few moments in sullen silence; and
then, as if to be revenged on the sex, he
determined
not to dance the whole evening;
accordingly he withdrew to a room
appropriated
to the gentlemen, where he found
a few of the military beaux, keeping alive
the stimulus they had brought with them
from the mess-table.
As Clara had prudently decided to
comport
herself as a clergyman's wife, and had
declined dancing in future; Catherine
Chatterton
was the lady entitled to open the ball,
as superior in years and rank, to any who
were disposed to enjoy the amusement. The
dowager, who in her heart loved to show
her airs upon such occasions, had chosen to
be later than the rest of the family; and
Lucy had to entreat her father to have
patience, more than once, during the
interregnum
in their sports, created by Lady
Chatterton's fashion; she at length appeared,
attended by her son, and followed by her
daughters, ornamented in all the taste of the
reigning fashions. Doctor Ives and his wife,
who came late from choice, soon appeared,
accompanied by their guest, and the dancing
commenced; Denbigh had thrown aside his
black for the evening, and as he approached
to claim his promised honour, Emily thought
him, if not as handsome, much more
interesting
than Colonel Egerton, who passed
them in leading her sister to the set. Emily
danced beautifully, but perfectly like a lady,
as did Jane: but Denbigh, although
graceful
in his movements, and in time, knew but
little of the art; and but for the assistance of
his partner, would have more than once gone
wrong in the figure; he very gravely asked
her opinion of his performance as he handed
her to a chair, and she laughingly told him,
his movements were but a better sort of
march; he was about to reply, when Jarvis
approached; he had, by the aid of a pint of
wine and his own reflections, wrought
himself
into something of a passion; especially
as he saw Denbigh enter, after Emily had
declined dancing with himself; there was
a gentleman in the corps who unfortunately
was addicted to the bottle, and he fastened
on Jarvis, as a man at leisure to keep him
company, in his favourite libations; wine
openeth the heart, and the captain having
taken a peep at the dancers, and seen the
disposition
of affairs, returned to his bottle
companion
bursting with the indignity offered
to his person; he dropped a hint, and a
question
or two brought the whole grievance
from him.
There is a certain set of men in every
service, who imbibe notions of bloodshed,
and indifference to human life, that is
revolting
to humanity, and too often, fatal in its
results; their morals are never correct, and
what little they have sets loosely about them
---in their own cases, their appeals to arms
are not always so prompt; but in that of their
friends, their perceptions of honour are
intuitively
keen, and their inflexibility in
preserving
it from reproach unbending---and such
is the weakness of mankind, their tenderness
on points where the nicer feelings of a
soldier
are involved, that these machines of
custom
these
thermometers graduated to the
scale of false honour---usurp the place of
reason
and benevolence, and become, too often,
the arbiters of life and death to a whole corps.
Such, then, was the confidant to whom Jarvis
communicated the cause of his disgust, and
the consequences may easily be imagined.
As he passed Emily and Denbigh, he threw
a look of fierceness at the latter, which he
meant as an indication of his hostile
intentions
;
but which was lost on his rival, who,
at that moment, was filled with passions of
a very different kind from those which
Captain
Jarvis thought agitated his own bosom;
for had his new friend let him alone, he
would have quietly gone home and gone to
sleep.
Have you ever fought, said Captain
Digby cooly to his companion, as they seated
themselves in his father's parlour, whither
they had retired to make their arrangements
for the following morning.
Yes, said Jarvis, with a stupid look,
I fought once with Tom Halliday at
school.
At school! my dear friend, you
commenced
young indeed, said Digby, helping
himself, and how did it end?
Oh! Tom got the better, and so I cried
enough, said Jarvis surlily
Enough! I hope you did not flinch,
cried his friend, eyeing him keenly; where
were you hit?
VOL. I. 11
He hit me all over.
All overdid you use small shot? How
did you fight?
With fists, said Jarvis, yawning; and
his companion seeing how the matter was,
rung for his servant to put him to bed,
remaining
himself an hour longer to finish the
bottle.
Soon after Jarvis had given Denbigh the
look big with his intended vengeance,
Colonel
Egerton approached Emily, asking
permission
to present Sir Herbert Nicholson,
the lieutenant-colonel of the regiment, and
a gentleman who was ambitious of the
honour
of her acquaintance, and a friend of
his own; Emily gracefully bowed her
assent
:
soon after, turning her eyes on Denbigh,
who had been speaking to her at the moment,
she saw him looking intently on the two
soldiers, who were making their way through
the crowd to where she sat; he stammered,
said something she could not understand,
and precipitately withdrew; and although
both herself and her aunt sought his figure in
the gay throng that flitted around them, he
was seen no more that evening.
Are you acquainted with Mr.
Denbigh
,
said Emily to her partner, after
looking
in vain to find his person in the crowd.
Denbigh! Denbigh! I have known one
or two of that name, replied the gentleman;
in the army there are several.
Yes, said Emily, musing, he is in the
army; and looking up, she saw her
companion
reading her countenance with an
expression
that brought the colour to her
cheeks, with a glow that was painful. Sir
Herbert smiled, and observed the room was
warmEmily acquiesced in the remark,
for the first time in her life, conscious of a
feeling she was ashamed to have
scrutinized
,
and glad of any excuse to hide her
confusion.
Grace Chatterton is really beautiful to
night, said John Moseley to his sister Clara;
I have a mind to ask her to dance.
Do, John, replied his sister, looking
with pleasure on her beautiful cousin; who
observing the movements of John, as he drew
near to where she sat, moved her face on
either side rapidly, in search of some one
who was apparently not to be found; the
undulations of her bosom perceptibly
increased
,
and John was on the point of
speaking
to her, as the dowager stepped between
them. There is nothing so flattering to the
vanity of a man, as the discovery of emotions
in a young woman, excited by himself, and
which the party evidently wishes to conceal
there is nothing so touching---so sure to
captivate; or if it seem to be affected---so
sure to disgust.
Now, Mr. Moseley, cried the mother,
you must not ask Grace to dance; she can
refuse
you nothing, and she has been up the two
last figures.
Your wishes are irresistible, Lady
Chatterton
,
said John, as he coolly turned on his
heel; on gaining the other side of the room,
he turned to reconnoitre the scene. The
dowager was fanning herself as violently as
if
she
had been up the two last figures,
instead
of her daughter, while Grace sat with
her eyes fastened on the floor, paler than
usual---Grace--thought the young man,
would be very handsome---very sweet---
very, very every thing that is agreeable, if
if it were not for mother Chatterton---
and he led out one of the prettiest girls in the
room.
Col. Egerton was peculiarly adapted to
the ball room; he danced gracefully and with
spirit; was perfectly at home with all the
usages of the best society, and never
neglectful
of any of those little courtesies
which have their charm for the moment;
and Jane Moseley, who saw all those she
loved around her, apparently as happy as
herself, found in her judgment, or the
convictions
of her principles, no counterpoise
against the weight of such attractions, all
centred
,
as it were, in one effort to please
herself
;---his
flattery was deep---was respectful
---his tastes were her tastes---his opinions
her opinions---On the formation of their
acquaintance
,
they had differed in some trifling
point of poetical criticism, and for near a
month the colonel had maintained his
opinion
,
with a show of firmness; but as
opportunities
were not wanting for the
discussion
,
he had felt constrained to yield to her
better judgmenther purer taste. The
conquest
of Colonel Egerton was complete, and
Jane, who saw in his attentions the
submission
of a heart devoted to her service,
began
to look forward to the moment, with
trembling, that was to remove the thin
barrier
that existed between the adulation of the
eyes, and the most delicate assiduity to please,
and the open confidence of declared love;
Jane Moseley had a heart to love, and love
strongly; her danger existed in her
imagination
;
it was brilliant, unchastened by her
judgment, we had almost said, unfettered
by her principles;principles such as are
found in every day maxims and rules of
conduct
,
sufficient to restrain her within the
bounds of perfect decorum, she was
furnished
with in abundance; but that principle
which was to teach her submission in
opposition
to her wishes, that principle that could
alone afford her security against the treachery
of her own passions, she was a stranger to.
The family of Sir Edward were among the
first to retire, and as the Chattertons had
their own carriage, Mrs. Wilson and her
charge returned alone in the coach of the
former. Emily, who had been rather out of
spirits the latter part of the evening, broke
the silence by suddenly observing,
Colonel
Egerton is, or will soon be, a perfect
11*
hero. Her aunt, somewhat surprised, both
with the abruptness and force of the remark,
inquired her meaningOh, Jane will
make him one, whether or no. This was
spoken with a show of vexation in her niece
she was unused to; and Mrs. Wilson gravely
corrected her for speaking in a disrespectful
manner of her sister, one whom neither her
years nor situation entitled her, in any
measure
,
to advise or control---there was an
impropriety
in judging so near and dear a
relation
harshly, even in thought. Emily pressed
the hand of her aunt, as she acknowledged
her error; but added, that she felt a
momentary
irritation at the idea, that a man of
Colonel Egerton's character, should gain the
command over feelings, such as her sister
possessed. Mrs. Wilson kissed the cheek of
her niece, while she inwardly acknowledged
the probable truth of the very remark she
had thought it her duty to censure; that the
imagination of Jane would supply her lover
with those qualities she most honoured
herself, she took as a matter of course;
and that, when the veil was removed she
had helped to throw before her own eyes,
she would cease to respect, and of course,
cease to love him, when too late to remedy
the evil, she greatly feared. But in the
approaching
fate of Jane, she saw new cause
to call forth her own activity, in averting a
similar, or what she thought would prove a
heavier misfortune, from her own charge.
Emily Moseley had just completed her
eighteenth year, and was gifted by nature,
with a vivacity and ardency of feeling that
gave a heightened zest to the enjoyments of
that happy age. She was artless, but
intelligent
;
cheerful, with a deep conviction of the
necessity of piety; and uniform in her
practice
of all the important duties required by
her professions. The unwearied exertions
of her aunt, aided by her own quickness of
perception, had made her familiar with the
attainments suitable to her sex and years---
For music she had no taste, and the time
which would have been thrown away in
endeavouring
to cultivate a talent she did not
possess, was dedicated, under the discreet
guidance of her aunt, to works which had a
tendency, both to qualify her for the duties
of this life, and fit her for that which comes
hereafter. It might be said, Emily Moseley had
never read a book that contained a sentiment,
or inculcated an opinion, improper for her sex,
or dangerous to her morals; and it was not
difficult for those who knew the fact, to fancy
they could perceive the consequences in her
guileess countenance and innocent
deportment
.
Her looks---her actions--her thoughts,
wore as much of nature, as the discipline of
her well-regulated mind, and softened manners
could admit of; in person, she was of the
middle size, exquisitely formed, graceful and
elastic in her step, without the least
departure
from her natural movements; her
eye was a dark blue, with an expression of
joy and intelligence; at times it seemed all
soul, and again all heart; her colour rather
high, but varying with every emotion of her
bosom; her feelings strong, ardent, and
devoted
to those she loved. Her preceptress
had never found it necessary to repeat an
admonition
of any kind, since her arrival at
years to discriminate between the right and
the wrong.
I wish, said Doctor Ives to his wife;
the evening his son had asked their
permission
to address Clara, Francis had chosen
my little Emily.
Clara is a good girl, replied his wife,
she is so mild, so affectionate, that I doubt
not she will make him happy---Frank might
have done worse at the Hall.
For himself, he has done well, I hope,
said the father; a young woman of Clara's
heart, may make any man happy; but an
union with puritysenseprinciples, like
those of Emily, would be more---it would be
blissful.
Mrs. Ives smiled at her husband's
animation
,
as she observed, you remind me more
of the romantic youth I once knew, than of
the grave divine before me. There is but one
man I know, that I could wish, now, to give
Emily to; it is Lumley---if Lumley sees
her, he will woo her; and if he woos, he
will win her.
And Lumley I believe to be worthy of
her, cried the rector, as he retired for the
night.
CHAPTER XIII.
The following day brought a large party
of the military beaux to the Hall, in
acceptance
of the baronet's hospitable
invitation
to dinner. Lady Moseley was delighted;
so long as her husband's or her children's
interest had demanded a sacrifice of her love
of society, it had been made without a sigh,
almost without a thought. The ties of
affinity in her were sacred; and to the
happiness
,
the comfort of those she felt an
interest
in, there were few sacrifices of her
own propensities, she would not cheerfully
have made---it was this very love for her
offspring, that made her anxious to dispose
of her daughters in wedlock; her own
marriage
had been so happy, she naturally
concluded
it the state most likely to insure the
happiness of her children; and with Lady
Moseley, as with thousands of others, who,
averse or unequal to the labours of
investigation
,
jump to conclusions over the long
line of connecting reasons, marriage was
marriage, a husband was a husband; it is
true, there were certain indispensables,
without
which, the formation of a connexion
was a thing she considered not within the
bounds of nature; there must be fitness in
fortune, in condition, in education and
manners
;
there must be no glaring evil, although
she did not ask for positive gooda
professor
of religion herself, had any one told her
it was a duty of her calling, to guard
against a connexion with any but a christian,
for her girls, she would have wondered at
the ignorance that would embarrass the
married
state, with feelings exclusively
belonging
to the individual; had any one told her
it were possible to give her child to any but
a gentleman, she would have wondered at
the want of feeling, that could devote the
softness of Jane, or Emily, to the association
with rudeness or vulgarity. It was the
misfortune
of Lady Moseley, to limit her views
of marriage to the scene of this life,
forgetful
that every union gives existence to a long
line of immortal beings, whose future
welfare
depends greatly on the force of early
examples, or the strength of early
impressions
.
The necessity for restriction in their
expenditures
had ceased, and the baronet and
his wife greatly enjoyed the first opportunity
their secluded situation had given them, to
draw around their board their
fellow-creatures
of their own stampin the former, it
was pure philanthropy; the same feeling
urged him to seek out and relieve distress in
humble life;---while in the latter, it was love
of station and seemliness---it was becoming
the owner of Moseley Hall, and it was what
the daughters of the Benfield family had
done since the conquest.
I am extremely sorry, said the good
baronet at dinner, Mr. Denbigh declined
our invitation to day; I hope he will ride over
in the evening yet.
Looks of a singular cast were exchanged
between Colonel Egerton and Sir Herbert
Nicholson, at the mention of Denbigh's
name; which, as the latter had just asked
the favour of taking wine with Mrs. Wilson,
did not escape her notice: Emily had
innocently
mentioned his precipitate retreat the
night before; and he had, when reminded
of his engagement to dine with them that
very day, and promised an introduction to Sir
Herbert Nicholson by John, in her presence,
suddenly excused himself and withdrew; with
an indefinite suspicion of something wrong,
she ventured to address Sir Herbert with,
Did you know Mr. Denbigh in Spain.
I told Miss Emily Moseley, I believe,
last evening, that I knew some of the name,
replied the gentleman, evasively; and then
pausing a moment, he added with great
emphasis
,
there is a circumstance connected
with one of that name, I shall ever
remember
.
It was creditable, no doubt, Sir
Herbert
,
cried young Jarvis sarcastically; but
the soldier affecting not to hear the
question
,
asked Jane to take wine with him;
Lord Chatterton, however, putting his knife
and fork down gravely, and with a glow of
animation, observed with unusual spirit, I
have no doubt it did, sir; Jarvis, in his turn,
affected not to hear this speech, and nothing
further was said, as Sir Edward saw the
name of Mr. Denbigh excited a sensation
amongst his guests he was unable to account
for, and which he soon forgot himself.
After the company had retired, Lord
Chatterton
,
however, related to the astonished and
indignant family of the baronet, the
substance
of the following scene, which he had
been a witness to that morning, while on a
visit to Denbigh at the rectory: as sitting in
the parlour by themselves over their
breakfast
,
a Captain Digby was announced, and
asked in.
I have the honour of waiting upon you,
Mr. Denbigh, said the soldier, with the stiff
formality of a professed duellist, on behalf
of Captain Jarvis, but will postpone my
business
until you are at leisure, glancing his
eye on Chatterton.
I know of no business with Captain
Jarvis, said Denbigh, politely handing the
stranger a chair, that Lord Chatterton
cannot be privy to; if he will excuse the
interruption
.
The nobleman bowed, and
Captain Digby, a little lowered by the rank
of Denbigh's friend, proceeded in a more
easy manner.
Captain Jarvis has empowered me, sir,
to make any arrangement with yourself or
friend, previous to your meeting, which he
VOL. I. 12
hopes may be as soon as possible, if
convenient
to yourself, replied the soldier cooly.
Denbigh viewed him for a moment with
astonishment, in silence; when recollecting
himself, he said mildly, and without the least
agitation, I cannot affect, sir, not to
understand
your meaning, but am at a loss to
imagine
what act of mine can have made Mr.
Jarvis wish to make such an appeal.
Surely Mr. Denbigh cannot think a man
of Captain Jarvis's spirit can quietly submit
to the indignity put upon him last evening,
by your dancing with Miss Moseley, after
she had declined the honour to himself,
said the captain, with an affectation of an
incredulous
smile. My Lord Chatterton
and myself can easily settle the preliminaries,
as Captain Jarvis is much disposed to
consult
your wishes, Sir, in this affair.
If he consults my wishes, said Denbigh,
smiling, he will think no more about it.
At what time, Sir, asked Digby, will
it be convenient to give him the meeting?
and then, speaking with a kind of bravado
gentlemen of his cast are fond of assuming,
my friend would not hurry any settlement
of your affairs.
I cannot ever give a meeting to Captain
Jarvis, with hostile intentions, replied
Denbigh
,
calmly.
Sir!
I decline the combat, Sir, said
Denbigh
,
speaking with firmness.
Your reasons, Sir, if you please, asked
Captain Digby, compressing his lips, and
drawing up in an air of personal interest.
Surely, cried Chatterton, who had with
difficulty restrained his feelings, surely
Mr. Denbigh could never so far forget
himself
,
as to expose Miss Moseley by accepting
this invitation.
Your reason, my lord, said Denbigh
with interest, would at all times have its
weight; but I wish not to qualify an act of
what I conceive to be principle, by any lesser
considerationI cannot meet Captain
Jarvis
,
or any other man, in private combat;
there can exist no necessity for an appeal to
arms, in any society where the laws rule,
and I am averse to blood-shed.
Very extraordinary, muttered Captain
Digby, somewhat at a loss how to act; but
the calm and collected manner of Denbigh
prevented a reply; and after declining a cup
of tea, a liquor he never drank, he withdrew,
saying, he would acquaint his friend with
Mr. Denbigh's singular notions.
Captain Digby had left Jarvis at an inn,
about half a mile from the rectory, for the
convenience of early information of the
result
of his conference. The young man had
walked up and down the room during
Digby's
absence, in a train of reflections
entirely
new to him; he was the only son of
his aged father and mother, the protector of
his sisters, and he might say, the sole hope of
a rising family; and then, possibly, Denbigh
might not have meant to offend himhe
might even have been engaged before they
came to the house; or if not, it might have
been inadvertence on the part of Miss
Moseley
that
Denbigh would offer some
explanation
he believed, and he had fully made up
his mind to accept it, as his fighting friend
entered. Well, said Jarvis, in a low
tone.
He says he will not meet you, dryly
exclaimed his friend, throwing himself into
a chair, and ordering a glass of brandy and
water.
Not meet me, cried Jarvis, in surprise;
engaged, perhaps.
Engaged to his conscience, exclaimed
Digby, with an oath.
To his conscience! I do not know I
rightly understand you, Captain Digby,
said Jarvis, catching his breath, and raising
his voice a little.
Then, Captain Jarvis, said his friend,
tossing off his brandy, and speaking with
great deliberation, he says that nothing
understand me---nothing will ever make him
fight a duel.
He will not! cried Jarvis, in a loud
voice.
No, he will not, said Digby, handing
his glass to a waiter for a fresh supply.
He shall.
I don't know how you will make him,
said Digby, cooly.
Make him, I'llI'll post him.
Never do that, said the captain, turning
to him, as he leaned his elbows on the table,
it only makes both parties ridiculous; but
I'll tell you what you may dothere's a Lord
Chatterton takes the matter up with warmth;
if I were not afraid of his interest hurting
my promotion, I should have resented
something
that fell from him myselfhe will
fight, I dare say, and I'll just return and
require
an explanation of his words on your
behalf.
Nono, said Jarvis, rather hastily,
hehe is related to the Moseleys, and I
have views there---it might injure.
Did you think to forward your views, by
making the young lady the subject of a duel,
asked Captain Digby sarcastically, and
eyeing his companion with great contempt.
Yes, yes, said Jarvis, it would hurt
my views.
Here's to the health of His Majesty's
gallant  regiment of foot, cried
Captain
Digby, in a tone of irony, three quarters
drunk, at the mess table, that evening, and
to its champion, Captain Henry Jarvis.
One of the corps was present accidentally as
a guest; and the following week the
inhabitants
of F saw the regiment in their
barracks marching to slow time after the
body of Horace Digby.
12*
Lord Chatterton, in relating the part of the
foregoing circumstances which fell under
his observation, did ample justice to the
conduct
of Denbigh; a degree of liberality
which did him no little credit, as he plainly
saw in that gentleman he had, or soon would
have, a rival in the dearest wish of his heart;
and the smiling approbation with which his
cousin Emily rewarded him for his candour,
almost sickened him with the apprehension
of his being a successful one. The ladies
were not slow in expressing their disgust
with the conduct of Jarvis, or backward
in their approval of Denbigh's forbearance.
Lady Moseley turned with horror from a
picture in which she could see nothing but
murder and bloodshed; but both Mrs.
Wilson
and her niece, secretly applauded a
sacrifice
of worldly feelings on the altar of
duty; the former admired the consistent
refusal
of admitting any collateral
inducements
,
in explanation of his decision; while
the latter, at the same time she saw the act
in its true colours and elevated principle,
could hardly keep from believing that a
regard
for her feelings had, in a trifling
degree
,
its influence in his declining the
meeting
.
Mrs. Wilson saw at once what a hold
such unusual conduct would take on the
feelings of her niece, and inwardly
determined
to increase, if possible, the
watchfulness
she had invariably kept upon all he said
or did, as likely to elucidate his real
character
,
well knowing that the requisites to bring
or keep happiness in the married state, were
numerous and indispensable; and that the
display of a particular excellence, however
good in itself, was by no means conclusive
as to character; in short, that we perhaps
as often meet with a favourite principle, as a
besetting sin.
CHAPTER XIV.
Sir Edward Moseley had some difficulty
in restraining the impetuosity of his son from
taking some hasty step, in resenting this
impertinent
interference of young Jarvis, in the
conduct of his favourite sister; indeed, he
only yielded to his profound respect to his
father's commands, aided by a strong
representation
on the part of his sister, of the
disagreeable
consequences of connecting her
name with a quarrel in any manner. It was
seldom the good baronet felt himself called
upon to act as decidedly as on the present
occasion; he spoke to the merchant in warm,
but gentleman-like terms, of the
consequences
which might have resulted to his
own child, from the intemperate act of
his son; exculpated Emily entirely from
censure, by explaining her engagement to
dance with Denbigh, previously to his
application
;
and hinting the necessity, if the
affair
was not amicably terminated, of
protecting
the peace of mind of his daughters
against similar exposures in future, by
declining
the acquaintance of a neighbour he
respected as much as Mr. Jarvis.
The merchant was a man of few words,
but great promptitude; he had made his
fortune
,
and more than once saved it, by his
decision
;
and coolly assuring the baronet he
should hear no more of it, at least in a
disagreeable
way, took his hat and walked home
from the village where the conversation
passed; on arriving at his own house, he found
the family collected, for a morning ride, in the
parlour, and throwing himself into a chair,
he commenced with great violence by
saying
So, Mrs. Jarvis, you would spoil a very
tolerable book-keeper, by wishing to have
a soldier in your family; and there stands
the puppy who would have blown out the
brains of a deserving young man, if the good
sense of Mr. Denbigh had not denied him the
opportunity.
Mercy! cried the alarmed matron, on
whom Newgate, with all its horrors, floated,
and near which her early life had been
passed, and a contemplation of whose
frequent
scenes had been her juvenile
lessons
of moralityHarry! Harry! would
you murder.
Murder! echoed her son, looking
askance, as if to see the bailiffs, no,
mother
,
I wanted nothing but what was fair; Mr.
Denbigh would have had an equal chance to
have blown out my brains; I am sure every
thing would have been fair.
Equal chance, muttered his father, who
had cooled himself, in some measure, by an
extra pinch of snuff, no, sir, you have no
brains to loose; but I have promised Sir
Edward
that you shall make proper apologies
to himself, his daughter, and Mr. Denbigh;
this was rather exceeding the truth, but the
alderman prided himself on performing more
than he promised.
Apology, exclaimed the captain, why,
sir, the apology is due to meask Colonel
Egerton if he ever heard of an apology being
made by the challenger.
No, sure, said the mother, who having
now made out the truth of the matter,
thought it was likely to be creditable to her
child, Colonel Egerton never heard of such
a thingdid you, colonel?
Why, madam, said the colonel,
hesitatingly
,
and politely handing the
merchant
his snuff-box, which, in his agitation,
had fallen on the floor, circumstances
sometimes justify a departure from ordinary
measures; you are certainly right as a rule;
but not knowing the particulars in the present
case, it is difficult for me to decideMiss
Jarvis, the tilbury is ready; and the colonel
bowed respectfully to the merchant, kissed
his hand to his wife, and led their daughter to
his carriage.
Do you make the apologies? asked
Mr. Jarvis of his son, as the door closed
behind
them.
No, sir, replied the captain, sullenly.
Then you must make your pay answer
for the next six months, cried the father,
taking a signed draft on his banker from
his pocket, coolly tearing it in two pieces,
and carefully putting the name in his mouth,
and chewing it into a ball.
Why, alderman, said his wife, a name
she never used, unless she had something to
gain from her spouse, who loved to hear the
sound of the appellation after he had
relinquished
the office, it appears to me, that
Harry has shown nothing but a proper spirit
you are unkindindeed you are.
A proper spiritin what waydo you
know any thing of the matter?
It is a proper spirit for a soldier to fight,
I suppose, said the wife, a little at a loss to
explain.
Spirit, or no spirit, observed Mr. Jarvis,
as he left them, apology, or ten and
sixpence
.
Harry, said his mother, holding up her
finger in a menacing attitude, if you do beg
his pardon, you are no son of mine.
No, cried Miss Sarah, it would be
mean.
Who will pay my debts? asked the son,
looking up at the ceiling.
Why, I would, my child, ififI had
not spent my own allowance.
I would, echoed the sister, but if we
go to Bath, you know, I shall want my
money
.
Who will pay my debts, repeated the
son.
Apology, indeed; who is he, that you, a
son of Aldermanofof Mr. Jarvis, of the
deanery, B, Northamptonshire, should
beg his pardona vagrant that nobody
knows.
Who will pay my debts, said the
captain
,
drumming with his foot.
Why, Harry, exclaimed the mother,
do you love money better than honoura
soldier's honour?
No, mother; but I like good eating and
drinkingthink, mother, its a cool five
hundred
.
Harry, cried the mother, in a rage, you
are not fit for a soldier; I wish I were in your
place.
I wish, with all my heart, you had been for
an hour this morning, thought the son; and,
after arguing for some time longer, they
compromised
,
by agreeing to leave it to the
decision
of Colonel Egerton, who, the mother
did not doubt, would applaud her maintaining
the Jarvis dignity, a family his interest in
was but little short of what he felt for his
own---so he had told her fifty times---and
the captain determined within himself, to
touch the five hundred, let the colonel
decide
as he would; but the colonel's decision
prevented this disobedience to the commands
of one parent, in order to submit to the
requisition
of the other. The question was put
to him by Mrs. Jarvis, on his return from the
airing, with no doubt the decision would
be favourable to her opinion; the colonel
and herself, she said, never disagreed; and
the lady was rightfor wherever his interest
made it desirable to convert Mrs. Jarvis to
his side of the question, Egerton had a
manner of doing it, that never failed to
succeed
.
Why, madam, said he, with one of his
most agreeable smiles, apologies are
different
things at different times; you are
certainly
right in your sentiments, as relates to a
proper spirit in a soldier; but no one can
doubt the spirit of the captain, after the
stand he took in the affair; if Mr. Denbigh
would not meet him, (a very extraordinary
measure, indeed, I confess,) what can he do
more? he cannot make a man fight against his
will, you know.
True, true, cried the matron,
impatiently
,
I do not want him to fight; heaven
forbid
!
but why should he, the challenger, beg
pardon?I am sure, to have the thing
regular
Mr.
Denbigh is the one to ask
forgiveness
.
The colonel felt at a little loss how
to reply, when Jarvis, in whom the thoughts
of his five hundred pounds had worked a
mighty revolution, exclaimed
You know, mother, I accused himthat
is, suspected him of dancing with Miss
Moseley against my right to her; now you
find that was a mistake, and so I had better
act with dignity, and confess my error.
Oh, by all means, cried the colonel,
who saw the danger of an embarrassing
rupture
between the families otherwise,
delicacy
Vol. I. 13
to your sex requires that, ma'am, from
your son; and he accidentally dropped a
letter
as he spoke.
From Sir Edgar, colonel? asked Mrs.
Jarvis, as he stooped to pick it up.
From Sir Edgar, madam, and he begs to
be remembered to yourself and family.
Mrs. Jarvis bowed in what she intended for
a graceful bend, and sigheda casual
observer
might have thought, with maternal
anxiety for the reputation of her childbut it
was conjugal regret, that the political
obstinacy
of the alderman, had prevented his
carrying up an address, and thus becoming
Sir Timothy. Sir Edgar's heir
prevailed
,
and the captain received permission
to do what he had done already.
On leaving the room, after the first
discussion, and before the appeal, he had
hastened to his father with his concessions.
The old gentleman knew too well the
influence
of five hundred pounds, to doubt their
effects in the present instance, and had
ordered
his carriage for the excursionit came,
and to the hall they proceeded; the captain
found his intended antagonist there, and in
a rather uncouth manner, made the required
concession. He was restored to his former
favourno great distinctionand his visits
to the hall suffered, but with a dislike Emily
could never conquer, or at all times
conceal
.
Denbigh was standing with a book in his
hand, when Jarvis commenced his speech to
the baronet and his daughter, and was
apparently
much engaged with its contents, as
the captain blundered through. It was
necessary
,
the captain saw by a glance of his
father's eyes, to say something to the
gentleman
,
who had delicately withdrawn to a
distant
window. His speech was made here too,
and Mrs. Wilson could not avoid stealing a
look at them; Denbigh smiled and bowed in
silence. It is enough, thought the widow;
the offence was not against him, it was
against his maker; he should not arrogate to
himself, in any manner, the right to forgive, or
require apologiesthe whole is consistent.
The subject was never afterwards alluded to;
Denbigh appeared to have forgotten it; and
Jane sighed gently as she hoped the colonel
was not a duellist.
Several days passed, before the deanery
ladies could forgive the indignity their
family
had sustained, sufficiently to resume
their customary intercourse; like all other
grievances, where the passions are chiefly
interested
,
it was forgotten in time, and things
put in some measure on their former footing.
The death of Digby served to increase the
horror of the Moseleys, and Jarvis himself
felt rather uncomfortable, on more accounts
than one, at the fatal termination of the
unpleasant
business.
Chatterton, who to his friends had not
hesitated
to avow his attachment to his cousin,
but who had never proposed for her, as his
present views and fortune were not, in his
estimation, sufficient for her proper support;
had pushed every interest he possessed, and left
no steps unattempted an honourable man could
resort to, to effect his object. This desire to
provide
for his sisters, had been backed by the
ardour of a passion that had reached its crisis;
and the young peer, who could not, in the
present state of things, abandon the field to
a rival so formidable as Denbigh, even to
further his views to preferment, was waiting
in anxious suspense the decision on his
application
:
a letter from his friend informed him,
his opponent was likely to succeed; that, in
short, all hopes of his lordship's success had
left himChatterton was in despair. On
the following day, however, he received a
second letter from the same friend,
announcing
his appointment; after mentioning
the fact, he went on to sayThe cause of
this sudden revolution in your favour is
unknown
to me, and unless your lordship has
obtained interest I am ignorant of, it is one
of the most singular instances of ministerial
caprice I have ever heard of. Chatterton
was as much at a loss as his friend, but it
mattered not; he could now offer to Emily
it was a patent office, to a large amount in
receipts, and a few years would amply
portion
his sisters; that very day he proposed,
and was refused.
Emily had a difficult task to avoid
self-reproach
,
in regulating her deportment to the
peer. She was fond of Chatterton as a
relation
as
her brother's friendas the
brother
of Grace, and even on his own account;
but it was the fondness of a sister; his
manner
his
words, which although never
addressed
to herself, were sometimes
overheard
unintentionally, and sometimes reached
her through her sisters, left her in no doubt
of his attachment; she was excessively
grieved at the discovery, and innocently
appealed
to her aunt for directions how to
proceed
;
of his intentions she had no doubt, but
at the same time he had not put her in a
situation
to dispel his hopes; encouragement, in
the usual meaning of the term, she gave to
him, or no one else. There are no little
attentions
that lovers are fond of showing to
their mistresses, and which mistresses are
fond of receiving, that Emily ever permitted
to any gentlemanno ridesno walksno
tet-a-ttes; always natural and unaffected,
there was a simple dignity about her that
forbade
the request, almost the thought, in the
gentlemen of her acquaintance; Emily had
no amusements, no pleasures of any kind,
in which her sisters were not her companions;
and if any thing was on the carpet, that
required
an attendant, John was ever ready; he
was devoted to her; the decided preference she
13*
gave him over every other man, upon such
occasions, flattered his affections; and he
would, at any time leave even Grace
Chatterton
,
to attend his sisterall this was
without
affectation, and generally without notice.
Emily so looked the delicacy and reserve she
acted without ostentation, that not even her
own sex had affixed to her conduct the
epithet
of squeamish; it was difficult, therefore,
for her to do any thing, which would show
Lord Chatterton her disinclination to his
suit, without assuming a dislike she did not
feel, or giving him slights neither good
breeding
or good nature could justify; at one time,
indeed, she expressed a wish to return to
Clara; but this Mrs. Wilson thought would
only protract the evil, and she was compelled
to wait his own time. The peer himself did
not rejoice more in his ability to make the
offer, than Emily did to have it in her power
to decline it; her rejection was firm and
unqualified
,
but uttered with a grace and
tenderness to his feelings, that bound her
lover tighter than ever in her chains, and
he resolved on immediate flight as his only
recourse.
I hope nothing unpleasant has occurred
to Lord Chatterton, said Denbigh, with
great interest, as he reached the spot where
the young peer stood leaning his head
against a tree, on his route from the rectory
to the hall.
Chatterton raised his face as he spoke;
there were evident traces of tears on it, and
Denbigh, shocked, was delicately about to
proceed, as the baron caught his arm.
Mr. Denbigh, said the young peer, in a
voice almost choaked with emotion, may
you never know the pain I have felt this
morningEmilyEmily Moseley--is lost to
meforever.
For a moment, the blood rushed to the
face of Denbigh, and his eyes flashed with
a look that Chatterton could not stand; he
turned, as the voice of Denbigh, in those
remarkable
tones which distinguished it from
every other voice he had ever heard,
uttered
,
Chatterton, my lord, we are friends, I
hopeI wish it from my heart.
Go, Mr. Denbighgo; you were going
to Miss Moseleydo not let me detain you.
I am going with you, Lord Chatterton,
unless you forbid it, said Denbigh, with
emphasis, slipping his arm through that of
the peer's.
For two hours they walked together in the
baronet's park, and when they appeared at
dinner, Emily wondered why Mr. Denbigh
had taken a seat next her mother, instead of
his usual place between herself and aunt. In
the evening, he announced his intention of
leaving Bfor a short time with Lord
Chatterton; they were going to London
together
,
but he hoped to return within ten
days. This sudden determination caused
some surprise, but as the dowager supposed,
it was to secure the new situation, and the
remainder of their friends thought it might
be business, it was soon forgotten, but much
regretted for the time. They left the Hall
that night to proceed to an inn, from which
they could obtain a chaise and horses; and
the following morning, when the baronet's
family assembled around their social
breakfast
the peer and his companion were many
miles on their route to the metropolis.
CHAPTER XV.
Lady Chatterton, finding that little was to
be expected in her present situation,
excepting
what she looked forward to, from the
varying admiration of John Moseley to her
youngest daughter, determined to accept an
invitation of some standing, to a nobleman's
seat about fifty miles from the hall; and in
order
to keep things in their proper places,
leave Grace with her friend, who had
expressed
a wish to that effect; accordingly, the
day succeeding the departure of her son,
she proceeded on her expedition,
accompanied
by her willing assistant in her
matrimonial
speculations.
Grace Chatterton was by nature retiring
and delicate; but her feelings were acute,
and on the subject of female propriety,
sensitive
to a degree, that the great want of it in
a relation she loved as much as her mother,
had possibly in some measure increased; her
affections were too single in their objects to
have left her long in doubt, as to their nature
with respect to the baronet's son; and it was
one of the most painful orders she had ever
received, that compelled her to accept her
cousin's invitationher mother was
peremptory
,
and Grace was obliged to comply.
Every delicate feeling she possessed revolted
at the step; the visit itself was unwished for
on her part; but there did exist a reason
which had reconciled her to itthe wedding
of Clara; but now, to remain after all her
family had gone, in the house where resided
the man, who had as yet never solicited
those affections she had been unable to
withhold; it was humiliatingit was
degrading
her in her own esteem, and she could
not endure it.
It is said that women are fertile in
inventions
to further their schemes of personal
gratification, vanity, or even mischief; it may
beit is truebut the writer of these pages
is a manone who has seen much of the
sex, and he is happy to have an opportunity
of paying a tribute to female purity and
female
truth; that there are hearts so
disinterested
as to lose the considerations of self,
in advancing the happiness of those they love
that there are minds so pure, as to recoil
with disgust from the admission of deception,
indelicacy, or managementhe knows, for
he has seen it from long and close
examination
;
he regrets, that the very artlessness of
those who are most pure in the one sex,
subjects them to the suspicions of the grosser
materials which compose the other. He
believes
that innocency, singleness of heart,
ardency of feeling, and unalloyed shrinking
delicacy, sometimes exist in the female bosom,
to an extent that but few men are happy
enough to discover, and most men believe
incompatible with the frailties of human
nature. Grace Chatterton possessed no
little
of what may almost be called this ethereal
spirit; and a visit to Bolton parsonage was
immediately proposed by her to Emily. The
latter, too innocent herself to suspect the
motives of her cousin, was happy to be
allowed
to devote to Clara a fortnight,
uninterrupted
by the noisy round of visiting and
congratulations
which had attended her first
week; and Mrs. Wilson and the two girls left
the hall, the same day with the Dowager
Lady Chatterton. Francis and Clara were
happy to receive them, and they were
immediately
domesticated in their new abode.
Doctor
Ives and his wife had postponed an annual
visit to a relation of the former, on account
of the marriage of their son, and now availed
themselves of the visit of Clara's friends to
perform their own engagements. B
appeared
in some measure deserted, and
Egerton
had the field almost to himself.
Summer
had arrived, and the country bloomed in
all its luxuriance of vegetation; every thing
was propitious to the indulgence of the softer
passions; and Lady Moseley, ever a strict
adherent to forms and decorum, admitted the
intercourse between Jane and her admirer
to be carried to as great lengths as those
forms would justify; still the colonel was not
explicit, and Jane, whose delicacy dreaded
the exposure of her feelings that was
involved
in his declaration, gave or sought no
marked opportunities for the avowal of his
passion; yet they were seldom separate, and
both Sir Edward and his wife looked
forward
to their future union, as a thing not to
be doubted. Lady Moseley had given up
her youngest child so absolutely to the
government
of her aunt, that she seldom
thought of her future establishment; she had
that kind of reposing confidence in Mrs.
Wilson's
proceedings, that feeble minds ever
bestow
on those who are much superior to them;
and she even approved of a system in many
respects
,
which she could not endeavour to
imitate
;
her affection for Emily was not, however,
to be thought less than what she felt for her
other children; she was in fact her favourite,
and had the discipline of Mrs. Wilson
admitted
of so weak an interference, might
have been injured as such.
John Moseley had been able, by long
observation
,
to find out exactly the hour they
breakfasted at the deanery; the length of
time it took Egerton's horses to go the
distance
between that house and the hall;
and on the sixth morning after the departure
of his aunt, John's bays were in his phaeton,
and allowing ten minutes for the mile and a
half to the park gates, John had got happily
off his own territories, before he met the
tilbury
travelling eastward---I am not to know
which road the colonel may turn, thought
Johnand after a few friendly, but rather
hasty greetings, the bays were in full trot to
Bolton parsonage.
John, said Emily, holding out her hand
affectionately, and smiling a little archly, as
he approached the window where she stood,
you should take a lesson in driving from
Frank; you have turned more than one hair,
I believe.
How is Clara, cried John, hastily,
taking the offered hand, with a kiss, and
aunt Wilson?
Both well, brother, and out walking this
fine morning.
How happens it you are not with them,
inquired the brother, throwing his eyes round
the room; have they left you alone?
No, Grace has this moment left the
room.
Well, Emily, said John, taking his seat
very composedly, but keeping his eyes on
the door, I have come to dine with you;
I thought I owed Clara a visit, and have
managed nicely to give the colonel the
go-by.
Clara will be happy to see you, dear
John, said Emily, and so will aunt, and
so am I---as she drew aside his fine hair
with her fingers to cool his forehead.
And why not Grace, too? asked John,
with a look of a little alarm.
And Grace, too, I expect---but here she
is, to answer for herself.
Grace said but little on her entrance, but
her eyes were brighter than usual, and she
Vol. I. 14
looked so contented and happy, that Emily
observed to her, in an affectionate manner,
I knew the Eau-de-Cologne would do
your head good.
Is Miss Chatterton unwell, said
Moseley
,
with a look of interest.
A slight head ache, said Grace, faintly,
but I feel better.
Want of air and exercise; my horses
are at the door; the phaeton will hold three
easily; run, sister, for your hats, almost
pushing Emily out of the room as he spoke.
In a few minutes the horses might have been
suffering for air, but surely not for exercise.
I wish, cried John, with impatience,
when at the distance of a couple of miles
from the parsonage, that gentleman had
driven his gig out of the road.
There was a small group on one side of
the road, consisting of a man, woman, and
several children. The owner of the gig
had alighted for some purpose, and was
in the act of speaking to them, as the
phaeton approached at a great rate.
John, cried Emily, in terror, you
never can pass---you will upset us.
There is no danger, dear Grace, said
the brother, endeavouring to check his
horses; he succeeded in part, but not so as
to prevent his passing at a spot where the
road was narrow; his wheel hit violently
against a stone, and some of his works gave
way; the gentleman immediately hastened
to his assistance---it was Denbigh.
Miss Moseley! cried he, in a voice of
the tenderest interest, you are not hurt in
the least, I hope.
No, said Emily, recovering her breath,
only frightened; and taking his hand, she
sprang from the carriage.
Miss Chatterton found courage to wait
quietly for the care of John; his dear
Grace, had thrilled on her every nerve; and
she afterwards often laughed at Emily for
her terror when there was so little
danger---the
horses were not in the least frightened,
and after a little patching, John declared all
was safe. To ask Emily to enter the
carriage
again, was to exact no little sacrifice of
her feelings to her reason; and she stood in
a suspense that too plainly showed, the terror
she had been in had not left her.
If, said Denbigh, modestly, If Mr.
Moseley will take the ladies in my gig I will
drive the phaeton to the hall, as it is rather
unsafe for so heavy a load.
No, no, Denbigh, said John, coolly,
you are not used to such mettled nags as
mine--it would be unsafe for you to drive them;
if, however, you will be good enough to take
Emily into your gig---Grace Chatterton, I
am sure, is not afraid to trust my driving,
and we might all get back as well as ever.
Grace gave her hand almost unconsciously
to John, and he handed her into the phaeton,
as Denbigh stood willing to execute his part
of the arrangement, but too diffident to speak;
it was not a moment for affectation, if Emily
had been capable of it, and blushing with
the novelty of her situation, she took her
place in the gig; Denbigh stopped and
turned his eyes on the little group with
which he had been talking, and at that
moment
they caught the attention of John also;
he inquired of Denbigh their situations; their
tale was a piteous onetheir distress
evidently
real; the husband had been gardener
to a gentleman in a neighbouring county, and
he had been lately discharged, to make way,
in the difficulty of the times, for a relation of
the steward, who was in want of the place,
and suddenly thrown on the world with a
wife and four children, with but the wages
of a week for his and their support; they
had travelled thus far on the way to a
neighbouring
parish, where he said he had a right
to, and must seek, public assistance; their
children were crying for hunger, and the
mother, who was a nurse, had been unable
to walk further than where she sat, but had
sunk on the ground overcome with fatigue,
and weak from the want of nourishment.
Neither Emily or Grace could refrain from
tears at the recital of their heavy woes; the
want of sustenance was something so
shocking
in itself; and brought, as it were,
immediately
before their eyes, the appeal was
irresistible
.
John forgot his bays---forgot even
Grace, as he listened to the affecting story
related by the woman, who was much revived
by some nutriment Denbigh had obtained
from a cottage near them, and to which they
were about to proceed by his directions, as
Moseley interrupted them; his hand shook
--his eyes glistened as he took his purse from
his pocket, and gave several guineas from it
to the mendicant; Grace thought John had
never appeared so handsome as the moment
he handed the money to the gardener; his
face glowed with the unusual excitement,
and his symmetry had lost the only charm he
wanted in common---softness. Denbigh, after
waiting patiently until Moseley had bestowed
his alms, gravely repeated his directions for
their proceeding to the cottage, and the
carriages
moved on.
Emily revolved in her mind during their
short ride, the horrid distress she had
witnessed
;
it had taken a strong hold on her
feelings; like her brother, she was
warm-hearted
and compassionate, if we may use
the term, to excess, and had she been
prepared
with the means, the gardener would
have reaped a double harvest of donations; it
struck her at the moment, unpleasantly, that
Denbigh had been so backward in his
liberality---the
man had rather sullenly displayed half
a crown as his gift, in contrast with the
golden shower of John's generosity; it had
been even somewhat offensive in its
exhibition
,
and urged the delicacy of her brother
14*
to a more hasty departure, than under other
circumstances he would, just at the
moment
,
have felt disposed to. Denbigh,
however
,
had taken no notice of the indignity,
and continued his directions in the same
mild and benevolent manner he had used
during the interview. Half a crown was
but little, thought Emily, for a family that
was starving, though; and unwilling to judge
harshly of one she had begun to value so
highly, she came to the painful conclusion,
her companion was not as rich as he
deserved
.
Emily had not yet to learn that
charity was in proportion to the means of the
donor, and a gentle wish insensibly stole
over her, that Denbigh might in some way,
become more richly endowed with the good
things of this world; until this moment her
thoughts had never turned on his temporal
conditionshe knew he was an officer in the
army; but of what rank, or even of what
regiment, she was ignoranthe had
frequently
touched in his conversations on the
customs of the different countries he had
seen; he had served in Italyin the north
of Europein the West Indiesin Spain.
Of the manners of the people, of their
characters
in their countries, he spoke not
unfrequently
,
with a degree of intelligence, a
liberality, a justness of discrimination, that
had charmed his auditors; but on the point
of personal service he had maintained a
silence
that was inflexible, and a little
surprising
;
more particularly of that part of
his history which related to the latter
country
;
from all which, she was rather inclined
to think his rank not as conspicuous as she
thought his merit entitled him to, and that
possibly he felt an awkwardness of
contrasting
it with the more elevated station of
Colonel Egerton; the same idea had struck
the whole family, and prevented from
delicacy
any inquiries which might be painful;
he was so connected with the mournful event
of his father's death, that no questions could
be put with propriety to the doctor's family;
and if Francis had been more communicative
to Clara, she was too good a wife to
mention
it, and her own family possessed of too
just a sense of propriety, to touch upon
points that might bring her conjugal fidelity
in question.
Denbigh appeared himself a little abstracted
during the ride, but his questions concerning
Sir Edward and her friends were kind and
affectionate
;
as they approached the house, he
suffered his horse to walk; after some
hesitation
,
he took a letter from his pocket, and
handing it to her, said,
I hope Miss Moseley will not think me
impertinent, in becoming the bearer of a
letter
from her cousin, Lord Chatterton; he
requested
it so earnestly, that I could not refuse
taking what I am sensible is a great liberty,
for it would be deception, did I affect to be
ignorant
of his admiration, or his generous
treatment of a passion she cannot return
Chatterton, and he smiled mournfully, is
yet too true in his devotion to cease his
commendations
.
Emily blushed painfully, but took the
letter
in silence, and as Denbigh pursued the
topic no farther, the little distance they had
to go, was rode in silence; on entering the
gates, however, he said, inquiringly, and with
much interest,
I sincerely hope I have not given offence
to your delicacy, Miss Moseley---Lord
Chatterton
has made me an unwilling
confidant---I
need not say the secret is sacred on more
accounts than one.
Surely not, Mr. Denbigh, replied Emily,
in a low tone, and the gig stopping she
hastened
to accept the assistance of her brother to
alight.
Well, sister, cried John, with a laugh,
Denbigh is a disciple to Frank's system of
horse-flash---hairs smooth enough here, I
see; Grace and I thought you would never
get home. Now, John fibbed a little, for
neither Grace or himself, had thought in the
least about them, or any thing else but each
other, from the moment they separated until
the gig arrived.
Emily made no reply to this speech, and
as the gentlemen were engaged in giving
directions
concerning their horses, she seized
the opportunity to read Chatterton's letter.
I avail myself of the return of my
friend Mr. Denbigh to that happy family,
from which reason requires my
self-banishment
,
to assure my amiable cousin of my
continued respect for her character, and to
convince her of my gratitude for the
tenderness
she has manifested to feelings she cannot
return; I may even venture to tell her what
few women would be pleased to hear, but
what I know Emily Moseley too well to
doubt, for a moment, will give her unalloyed
pleasurethat owing to the kind, the
benevolent
,
the brotherly attentions of my true
friend, Mr. Denbigh, I have already gained
a peace of mind and resignation I once
thought was lost to me for ever. Ah! Emily,
my beloved cousin, in Denbigh you will find,
I doubt not, a mindprinciples congenial to
your own; it is impossible that he could see
you, without wishing to possess such a
treasure
;
and, if I have a wish that is now
uppermost
in my heart, it is, that you may learn
to esteem each other as you ought, and, I
doubt not, you will become as happy as you
deserve; what greater earthly blessing can I
implore upon you!
Chatterton
.
Emily, while reading this epistle, felt a
confusion
but little inferior to what would have
oppressed her had Denbigh himself been at her
feet, soliciting that love Chatterton thought
him so worthy of possessing; and when
they met, could hardly look in the face a
man who, it would seem, had been so openly
selected by another, as the being fittest to be
her partner for life. The unaltered manner
of Denbigh himself, however, soon
convinced
her that he was entirely ignorant of
the contents of the note he had been the
bearer of, and greatly relieved her from the
awkwardness his presence had at first
occasioned
.
Francis soon returned, accompanied by his
wife and aunt, and was overjoyed to find
the guest who had so unexpectedly arrived
in his absence. His parents had not yet
returned
from their visit, and Denbigh, of
course, would remain at his present quarters.
John promised to continue with them for a
couple of days; and the thing was soon
settled
to their perfect satisfaction. Mrs.
Wilson
knew the great danger of suffering young
people to be inmates of the same house too
well wantonly to incur the penalties; but
her visit had nearly expired, and it might
give her a better opportunity of judging
Denbigh's
character; and Grace Chatterton,
though too delicate to follow herself, was
well contented to be followed, especially
when John Moseley was the pursuer.
CHAPTER XVI.
I am sorry, aunt, Mr. Denbigh is not
rich, said Emily to Mrs. Wilson, after they
had retired in the evening, and almost
unconscious
of what she uttered. The latter looked
at her neice in surprise, at the abrupt remark,
and one so very different from the ordinary
train of Emily's reflections, as she required
an explanation. Emily slightly colouring at
the channel her thoughts had insensibly
stolen into, gave her aunt an account of their
adventures in the course of their morning's
ride, and touched lightly on the difference
in the amount of the alms of her brother and
Mr. Denbigh.
The bestowal of money is not always
an act of charity, observed Mrs. Wilson,
gravely, and the subject was dropped;
though neither ceased to dwell on it in their
thoughts, until sleep closed their eyes.
The following day Mrs. Wilson invited
Grace and Emily to accompany her in a
walk; the gentlemen having preceded them
in pursuit of their different avocations.
Francis
had his regular visits of spiritual
consolation
;
John had gone to the hall for his
pointers and fowling piece, the season for
woodcock having arrived; and Denbigh had
proceeded no one knew whither. On
gaining
the high-road, Mrs. Wilson desired her
companions to lead to the cottage, where the
family of the mendicant gardener had been
lodged, and thither they soon arrived. On
knocking at the door, they were immediately
admitted to an outer room, in which was the
wife of the labourer who inhabited the
building
,
engaged in her customary morning
employments
.
They explained the motives of
their visit, and were told the family they
sought were in an adjoining room, but she
rather thought at that moment engaged with
a clergyman, who had called a quarter of an
hour before them. I expect, my lady, its the
new rector, who every body says is so good to
the poor and needy; but I have not found time
yet to go to church to hear his reverence
preach, ma'am, curtseying and handing the
fresh dusted chairs to her unexpected visiters;
the ladies seated themselvestoo delicate to
interrupt Francis in his sacred duties, and
were silently waiting his appearance; when
a voice was distinctly heard through the
thin petition, the first note of which
undeceived
them as to the person of the
gardener's
visiter.
It appears then, Davis, by your own
confession
,
said Denbigh, mildly, but in a tone
of reproof, that your frequent acts of
intemperance
,
have at least given ground for
the steward in procuring your discharge, if it
has not justified him from what was his duty
to your common employer.
It is hard, sir, replied the man, sullenly,
to be thrown on the world with a family like
mine, to make way for a younger man with
but one child.
It may be unfortunate for your wife and
children, said Denbigh, but just, as
respects
yourself. I have already convinced
you, that my interference or reproof is not
an empty one; carry the letter to the person
to whom it is directed, and I pledge you, you
shall have a new trial; and should you
conduct
yourself soberly, and with propriety,
continued and ample support; the second
letter will gain your children immediate
admission
to the school I mentioned; and I
now leave you, with an earnest injunction to
remember that habits of intemperance, not
only disqualify you to support those who
have such great claims on your protection,
but inevitably leads to a loss of those powers
which are necessary to insure your own
eternal
welfare.
May Heaven bless your honour, cried
the woman, with fervour, and evidently in
tears, both for what you have said and
what you have done. Thomas only wants
to be taken from temptation, to become a
sober man againan honest one he has ever
been, I am sure.
I have selected a place for him, replied
Denbigh, where there is no exposure from
improper companions, and every thing now
depends upon himself under Providence.
Mrs. Wilson had risen from her chair on
VOL. I. 15
the first intimation given by Denbigh of his
intention to go, but had paused at the door to
listen to this last speech; when beckoning
her companions, she hastily withdrew, having
first made a small present to the woman of
the cottage, and requested her not to mention
their having called.
What becomes, now, of the comparative
charity of your brother and Mr. Denbigh,
Emily? asked Mrs. Wilson, as they gained
the road, on their return homeward. Emily
was not accustomed to hear any act of
John slightly spoken of, without at least
manifesting some emotion, which betrayed
her sisterly regard; but on the present
occasion
she chose to be silent; while Grace,
after waiting in expectation that her cousin
would speak, ventured to say timidly,
I am sure, dear madam, Mr. Moseley
was very liberal, and the tears were in his
eyes, while he gave the money; I was
looking
directly at him the whole time.
John is compassionate by nature,
continued
Mrs. Wilson, with an almost
imperceptible
smile. I have no doubt his
sympathies
were warmly enlisted on behalf of
this family; and possessing much, he gave
liberally; I have no doubt he would have
undergone personal privation to have relieved
their distress, and endured both pain and
labour, with such an excitement before him;
but what is that to the charity of Mr.
Denbigh
;
and she paused.
Grace was unused to contend, and least of
all, with Mrs Wilson; but unwilling to
abandon
John to such comparative censure, with
increased animation, she said,
If bestowing freely, and feeling for the
distress you relieve, be not commendable,
madam, I am sure I am ignorant what is.
That compassion for the woes of others
is beautiful in itself, and the want of it an
invariable
evidence of corruption from too
much, and ill-governed, intercourse with the
world, I am willing to acknowledge, my
dear Grace, said Mrs. Wilson, kindly, but
the relief of misery, where the heart has not
undergone this hardening ordeal, is only
a relief to our own feelingsthis is
compassion
;
but christian charity is a higher
order
of duty: it enters into every sensation
of the heartdisposes us to judge, as well as
act favourably to our fellow creaturesis
deeply seated in the sense of our own
unworthiness
keeps
a single eye in its
dispensations
of temporal benefits, to the
everlasting
happiness of the objects of its bounty
is consistentwell regulatedin short,
and Mrs. Wilson's pale cheek glowed with
an unusual richness of colour, it is a
humble
attempt to copy after the heavenly
example
of our Redeemer, in sacrificing ourselves
to the welfare of others, and does, and must
proceed from a love of his person, and an
obedience to his mandates.
And Mr. Denbigh, aunt, exclaimed.
Emily, the blood mantling to her cheeks with
a sympathetic glow, and losing the
consideration
of John in the strength of her
feeling, his charity you think to be thus.
So far, my child, as we can attribute
motives from the complexion of the conduct,
said her aunt, with lessened energy, such
appears to have been the charity of Mr.
Denbigh.
Grace was silenced, if not convinced; and
the ladies continued their walk, lost in their
own reflections, until they reached a bend in
the road which would hide the cottage from
their view. Emily involuntarily turned her
head as they arrived at this spot, and saw
that Denbigh had approached to within a few
paces of them. On joining them, he
commenced
his complimentary address in such a
way as convinced them the cottager had been
true to the injunction given her by Mrs. Wilson.
No mention was made of the gardener, and
Denbigh commenced a lively description of
Italian scenery, which their present situation
reminded him of. The discourse was
maintained
with great interest by himself and
Mrs. Wilson, on this subject, for the
remainder
of their walk.
It was yet early when they reached the
parsonage, where they found John, who had
driven to the hall to breakfast, already
returned
,
and who instead of pursuing his
favourite
amusement of shooting, laid down his
gun as they entered, observing, it is rather
soon yet for the woodcocks, and I believe I will
listen to your entertaining conversation, ladies,
for the remainder of the morning. He threw
himself upon a sofa at no great distance
from Grace, and in such a position as enabled
him, without rudeness, to study the features
of her lovely face, while Denbigh read
aloud to the ladies, at their request,
Campbell's
beautiful description of wedded love in
Gertrude of Wyoming.
There was a chastened correctness in the
ordinary manner of Denbigh which wore the
appearance of the influence of his reason,
and subjection of the passions, that, if any
thing, gave him less interest with Emily than
had it been marked by an evidence of
stronger feeling; but on the present occasion,
the objection was removed; his reading was
impressive; he dwelt on those passages which
had most pleased himself, with a warmth of
eulogium fully equal to her own undisguised
sensations. In the hour occupied in their
reading this exquisite little poem, and
commenting
on its merits and sentiments,
Denbigh
gained more on her imagination than in
all their former intercourse; his ideas were
as pure, as chastened, and almost as vivid as
the poet's; and Emily listened to his periods
with intense attention, as they flowed from
him in language as glowing as his ideas. The
poem had been first read to her by her brother,
and she was surprised to discover how she
had overloked its beauties on that occasion;
15*
even John acknowledged that it certainly
appeared
a different thing now from what he
then thought it; but Emily had taxed his
declamatory power, in the height of the
pheasant season; and some how or other,
John had now conceited, that Gertrude was
just such a delicate, feminine, warm-hearted
domestic girl, as Grace Chatterton. As
Denbigh
closed the book, and entered into a
general
conversation with Clara and her sister.
John followed Grace to a window, and,
speaking in a tone of unusual softness, he
said,
Do you know, Miss Chatterton, I have
accepted your brother's invitation to go into
Suffolk this summer, and that you are to be
plagued with me and my pointers again.
Plagued, Mr. Moseley, said Grace, in a
voice softer than his own, I am sureI am
sure, we none of us think you, or your dogs
ever a plague.
Ah! Grace, and John was about to
become
what he had never been before
sentimental
as
he saw the carriage of
Chatterton
,
containing the dowager and
Catherine
,
entering the parsonage gates.
Pshaw!
thought
John, there comes
mother
ChattertonAh! Grace, said John,
there are your mother and sister returned
already.Already! said the young lady;
and, for the first time in her life, she felt
rather unlike a dutiful child; at least, five
minutes could have made no great
difference
to her mother, and she would have so
liked to hear what it was John Moseley
meant to have said; for the alteration in his
manner, convinced her that his first ah!
Grace, was to have been continued in a
something different language, from what his
second ah! Grace, was ended.
Young Moseley and her daughter
standing
together at the open window, caught the
attention of Lady Chatterton, the moment
she got a view of the house; and she
entered
with a good humour she had not felt
since the disappointment of her late
expedition
on behalf of Catherine. The
gentleman
she had determined on for her object in
this excursion had been taken up by another
rover, acting on her own account, and
backed by a little more wit, and a good deal
more money, than what Kate could be fairly
thought to possess. Nothing further in that
quarter offering in the way of her
occupation
,
she turned her horses' heads towards
London, that great theatre, on which there
never was a loss for actors. The salutations
had hardly passed before turning to John,
she exclaimed, with what she intended for a
most motherly smile, what not shooting
this fine day, Mr. Moseley? I thought you
never missed a day in the season.
It is rather early yet, my lady, said John,
cooly, and something alarmed by the
expression
of her countenance.
Oh! continued the dowager, in the
same strain, I see how it is, the ladies have
too many attractions for so gallant a young
man as yourself. Now, as Grace, her own
daughter, was the only lady of the party who
could reasonably be supposed to have much
influence over John's movementsa young
gentleman seldom caring as much for their
own, as other people's sisters, this may be
fairly set down as a pretty broad hint of the
thoughts the dowager entertained of the state
of things; and John saw it, and Grace saw
it.The former cooly replied, why, upon
the whole, if your ladyship will excuse the
neglect, I will try a shot this fine day; and
in five minutes, Carlo and Rover were both
delighted.Grace kept her place at the
window, from a feeling she could not define,
and perhaps was unconscious of, until the
gate closed, and the shrubbery hid the
sportsman
from her sight, and then she withdrew
to her room toweep.
Had Grace Chatterton been a particle less
delicateless retiringblessed with a
managing
mother, as she was, John
Moseley
would not have thought a moment
about her; but on every occasion when the
dowager made any of her open attacks,
Grace discovered so much distress, so much
unwillingness to second them, that a
suspicion
of a confederacy never entered his
brain. It is not to be supposed that Lady
Chatterton's manuvres were limited to the
direct and palpable schemes we have
mentioned
;
nothese were the effervescence,
the exuberance of her zeal; but as is
generally
the case, they sufficiently proved the
ground-work of all her other machinations;
none of the little artifices of---placing---of
leaving alone---of showing similarity of tastes
---of compliments to the gentlemen, were
neglected; this latter business she had
contrived
to get Catherine to take off her hands;
but Grace could never pay a compliment in
her life, unless changing of colour,
trembling
,
undulations of the bosom, and such
natural movements can be called so; but she
loved dearly to receive them from John
Moseley.
Well, my child, said the mother, as she
seated herself by the side of her daughter,
who hastily endeavoured to conceal her tears,
when are we to have another wedding? I
trust every thing is settled between you and
Mr. Moseley by this time.
Mother! Mother! said Grace, nearly
convulsed with the bitterness of her regret,
Mother, you will break my heart, indeed
you will; and she hid her face in the clothes
of the bed by which she sat, and wept with
a feeling of despair.
Tut, my dear, replied the dowager, not
noticing her anguish, or mistaking it for
shame, you young people are fools in these
matters, but Sir Edward and myself will
arrange
every thing as it should be. The
daughter now not only looked up, but sprang
from her seat, her hands clasped together, her
eyes fixed in almost horror; her cheek pale
as death; but the mother had retired, and
Grace sank back in her chair with a
sensation
of disgrace, of despair, which could not
have been surpassed, had she readily merited
the heavy weight of obloquy and shame she
thought about to be heaped upon her.
CHAPTER XVII.
The
succeeding morning, the whole party,
with the exception of Denbigh, returned to
the Hall. Nothing had transpired out of the
ordinary course of the colonel's assiduities;
and Jane, whose sense of propriety forbad
the indulgence of tete-a-tetes, and such little
accompaniments of every-day attachments,
was rejoiced to see a sister she loved, and an
aunt she respected, once more in the bosom
of her family.
The dowager impatiently waited an
opportunity
to effect, what she intended for a
master-stroke of policy in the disposal of
Grace. Like all other managers, she thought
no one equal to herself in devising ways and
means, and was unwilling to leave any thing
to nature. Grace had invariably thwarted
all her schemes, by her obstinacy; and as she
thought young Moseley really attached to her,
she determined, by a bold stroke, to remove
the impediments of false shame, and the
dread of repulse, which she believed alone
kept the youth from an avowal of his wishes;
thus, also, get rid at once of a plague that had
annoyed her not a littleher daughter's
delicacy
.
Sir Edward spent an hour every morning
in his library, overlooking his accounts, and
other necessary employments of a similar
nature
;
and it was here she determined to have
the conference.
My Lady Chatterton, you do me
honour
,
said the baronet, handing her a chair,
on her entrance.
Upon my word, cousin, cried the
dowager
,
you have a very convenient
apartment
here, looking around her in affected
admiration of all she saw. The baronet
replied
,
and a short discourse on the
arrangements
of the whole house, insensibly led to
the taste of his mother, the Hon. Lady
Moseley, (a Chatterton,) until having warmed
the feelings of the old gentleman, by some
well-timed compliments of that nature, she
ventured on the principle object of her visit.
I am happy to find, baronet, you are so well
pleased with the family as to wish to make
another selection from it; I sincerely hope it
may prove as judicious as the former one.
Sir Edward was a little at a loss to
understand
her meaning, although he thought it
might allude to his son, who he had some
time suspected had views on Grace
Chatterton
,
willing to know the truth, and rather
pleased to find John had selected a young
woman he really loved in his heart, he
observed
,
I am not sure I rightly understand your
ladyship.
No! cried the dowager, in
well-counterfeited
affectation of surprise, perhaps
after all my maternal anxiety has deceived
me then: Mr. Moseley could hardly have
ventured to proceed without your
approbation
.
I have ever declined influencing any of
my children, Lady Chatterton, said the
baronet
,
and John is not ignorant of my
sentiments
;
I hope, however, you allude to an
attachment to Grace?
I did certainly, Sir Edward, said the
lady hesitatingly; I may be deceived, but
you must know the feelings, and a young
woman ought not to be trifled with.
My son is incapable of trifling, I hope,
cried Sir Edward with animation, and least
of all with Grace Chatterton. No, my lady,
you are right; if he has made his choice, he
should not be ashamed to avow it.
I would not wish on any account, to
hurry matters, said the dowager, but the
report which is abroad, will prevent other
young men from putting in their claims, Sir
Edward,(sighing)I have a mother's
feelings: if I have been hasty, your goodness
will overlook it, and Lady Chatterton
withdrew
with her handkerchief at her eyes, to
conceal the tearsthat did not flow.
Sir Edward thought all was natural and
as it should be, and he sought an early
conference
with his son.
John, said the father, ta kng his hand
kindly, you have no reason to doubt my
affection or compliance to your wishes;
fortune is a thing out of the question with a
VOL. I. 16
young man of your expectations; and Sir
Edward, in his eagerness to smooth the way,
went on: you can live here, or occupy my
small seat in Wiltshire. I can allow you
five thousand a year with much ease to
myself
.
Indeed, your mother and myself would
both straighten ourselves, to add to your
comforts; but it is unnecessarywe have
enough, and you have enough. Sir
Edward
would in a few minutes have settled
every thing to the dowager's perfect
satisfaction
,
had not John interrupted him, by the
exclamation of, what do you allude to,
father? in a tone of astonishment.
Allude to, said Sir Edward simply,
why Grace Chatterton, my son.
Grace Chatterton, Sir Edward; what
have I to do with Grace Chatterton? cried
his child, colouring a little.
Her mother has made me acquainted
with your proposals, said the baronet,
and
Proposals!
Attentions I ought to have said; and
you have no reason to apprehend any thing
from me, my child.
Attentions! said John haughtily; I
hope Lady Chatterton does not accuse me of
improper attentions to her daughter.
No, not improper, my son, said his
father
,
she is pleased.
She is, cried John impatiently, but I
am displeased, that she undertakes to put
constructions on my acts, that no attention
or words of mine will justify.
It was Sir Edward's turn now to be
surprised
.
He had thought he was doing his
son a kindness, when he had only been
forwarding
the dowager's schemes: but averse
to contention, and wondering at his cousin's
mistake, which he at once attributed to her
anxiety, he told John he was sorry there had
been any misapprehension, and left him.
No, no, said Moseley internally, as he
paced up and down his father's library,
my lady dowager, you are not going to
force a wife down my throat. If you do, I
am mistaken; and Grace, if Graceand
John softened and began to feel unhappy a
little, but his anger prevailed.
From the moment Grace Chatterton
conceived
a dread of her mother's saying any
thing to Sir Edward, her whole conduct was
altered. She could hardly look any of the
family in the face, and her most ardent wish
was, that they might depart. John she
avoided as she would an adder, although it
nearly broke her heart to do so.
Mr. Benfield had staid longer than usual,
and now wished to return. John Moseley
eagerly seized the opportunity; and the very
day after the conversation in the library, he
went to Benfield Lodge as a dutiful nephew,
to see his venerable uncle safely restored
once more to the abode of his ancestors.
Lady Chatterton now perceived, when too
late, she had overshot her mark, and at the
same time she wondered at the reason of
such a strange result, from such well
digested
and well conducted plans; she
determined
never again to interfere between her
daughter and the baronet's heir; concluding,
with a nearer approach to the truth than
always accompanied her deductions, that
neither resembled ordinary lovers, in their
temperament or opinions.
Perceiving no further use in remaining any
longer at the Hall, she took her leave, and
accompanied by both her daughters,
proceeded
to the capital, where she expected to meet
her son.
Dr. Ives and his wife returned to the
rectory
on the same day, and Denbigh resumed
his abode under their roof immediately. The
intercourse between the rector's family and
Sir Edward's was renewed, with all its
former
friendly confidence.
Col. Egerton began to speak of his
departure
also, but hinted his intentions of visiting
L at the period of the baronet's visit to
his uncle, before he proceeded to town in the
winter.
L was a small village on the coast,
within a mile of Benfield Lodge; and from
its natural convenience, had been resorted to
by the neighbouring gentry, for the benefit of
sea bathing. The baronet had promised Mr.
Benfield his visit should be made at an
earlier
day than usual, in order to gratify Jane
with a visit to Bath, before they went to
London, and at which town they were
promised
by Mrs. Jarvis the pleasure of her
society
,
and that of her son and daughters.
Precaution
is a word of simple
meaning
in itself, but various are the ways
adopted by different individuals in this life to
enforce its import; and not a few are the
evils which are thought necessary to guard
against. To provide in season against the
dangers of want, personal injury, loss of
character
,
and a great many other such
acknowledged
misfortunes, has become a kind of
instinctive
process of our natures. The few
exceptions which exist, only go to prove the
rule: in addition to these, almost every man
has some ruling propensity to gratify, to
advance
which, his ingenuity is ever on the
alertor some apprehended evil to avert,
which calls all his prudence into activity.
Yet how seldom is it exerted, in order to give
a rational ground to expect permanent
happiness
in wedlock.
Marriage is called a lottery, and it is thought,
like all other lotteries, there are more blanks
than prizes; yet is it not made more
precarious
than it ought to be, by our neglect of
that degree of precaution, which we would
be ridiculed for omitting in conducting our
every day concerns? Is not the standard of
testing the probability of matrimonial felicity,
placed too low? Ought we not to look more
to the possession of principles than to the
16*
possession of wealth? Or is it at all
justifiable
in a christian to commit a child, a
daughter
,
to the keeping of a man who wants the
very essential they acknowledge most
necessary
to constitute a perfect character? Most
men revolt at infidelity in a womanand
most men, however licentious themselves,
look for, at least, the exterior of religion in
their wives. The education of their children
is a serious responsibility; and although
seldom
conducted on such rules as will stand
the test of reason, is not to be entirely shaken
off: they choose their early impressions should
be correcttheir infant conduct at least
blameless
.
And are not one half mankind of the
male sex? Are precepts in religion, in
morals
,
only for females? Are we to reverse the
theory of the Mahommedans, and though we
do not believe it, act as if
men
had no souls?
Is not the example of the father as important
to the son, as that of the mother to the
daughter
?
In short, is there any security against
the commission of enormities, but a humble
and devout dependance on the assistance of
that Almighty Power, which is alone able to
hold us up against temptation.
Uniformity of taste, is no doubt necessary
to what we call love, at least to think so; but
is not taste acquired? Would our daughters
admire a handsome deist if properly
impressed
with a horror of its doctrines, sooner than
they now would a handsome Mahommedan?
We would refuse our children to a pious
dissenter
,
to give them to impious members of
the establishment; we make the substance
less than the shadow.
Our principal characters are possessed of
these diversified views of the evils to be
averted
.
Mrs. Wilson considers christianity an
indispensible requisite in the husband to be
permitted
to her charge, and watches against
the
possibility
of any other gaining the
affections
of Emily. Lady Chatterton considers
the want of an establishment, as the one sin
not to be forgiven, and directs her energies
to prevent this evil; while John Moseley
looks upon a free will as the birthright of an
Englishman, and is at the present moment
anxiously alive to prevent the dowager's
making him the husband of Grace, the thing
of all others he most desires.
CHAPTER XVIII.
John Moseley
returned from L
within
the week, and appeared as if his whole
delight consisted in knocking over the
inoffensive
birds. His restlessness induced him
to make a Jarvis his companion; for although
he abhorred the captain's style of pursuing
the sport, being in his opinion both out of
rule and without taste, yet he was a
constitutional
fidget, and suited his own moving
propensities
at the moment. Egerton and
Denbigh
were both frequently at the Hall, but
generally gave their time to the ladies, neither
being much inclined to the favourite
amusement
of John.
There was a little arbour within the walls
of the park, which had been for years the
retreat
from the summer heats to the ladies of
the Moseley family; even so long as the youth
of Mrs. Wilson it had been in vogue, and she
loved it with a kind of melancholy pleasure,
as the spot where she had first listened to the
language of love, from the lips of her late
husband; into this arbour the ladies had one
day retired during the warmth of a noon-day
sun, with the exception of Lady Moseley,
who had her own engagements in the house.
Between Egerton and Denbigh there was
maintained a kind of courtly intercourse,
which prevented any disagreeable collision
from their evident dislike. Mrs. Wilson
thought on the part of Denbigh, it was the
forbearance of a principled indulgence to
another's
weakness; while the colonel's otherwise
uniform good-breeding, was hardly able to
conceal
a something, amounting to very near
repugnance
,
with which he admitted the
association
.
Egerton had taken his seat on the
ground, near the feet of Jane; and Denbigh
had stationed himself on a bench placed
without
the arbour, but so near as to have the full
benefit of the shade of the noble oak, whose
branches had been trained, so as to compose
its principal covering. It might have been
accident, that gave each his particular
situation
;
but it is certain they were so placed,
as not to be in sight of each other, and so
that the Colonel was convenient to hand Jane
her scissors, or any other little implement
of her work that she occasionally dropped,
and so that Denbigh could read every
lineament
of the animated countenance of Emily
as she listened to his description of the
curiosities
of Egypt, a country in which he had
spent a few months while attached to the
army in Sicily. In this situation we will
leave them for an hour, happy in the society
of each other, while we trace the rout of John
Moseley and his companion, in their pursuit
of woodcock, on the same day.
Do you know, Moseley, said Jarvis, who
began to think he was a favourite with John,
that I have taken if into my head, this Mr.
Denbigh was very happy to plead his morals
for not meeting me; he is a soldier, but I
cannot find out what battles he has been in.
Captain Jarvis, said John coolly, the
less you say about that business the better;
call in Rover. Now another of Jarvis's
recommendations
was a set of lungs that might
have been heard a half a mile with great
ease on a still morning.
Why, said Jarvis rather humbly, I am
sensible, Mr. Moseley, I was very wrong as
regards your sister; but don't you think it a
little odd in a soldier not to fight when
properly
called upon.
I suppose Mr. Denbigh did not think
himself properly called upon, said John;
or perhaps he had heard what a great shot
you were.
Six months before his appearance in B,
Captain Jarvis had been a clerk in the
counting
room of Jarvis, Baxter & Co. and had
never held fire-arms of any kind in his hand,
with the exception of an old blunderbuss,
which had been a kind of sentinel over the
iron chest for years. On mounting the
cockade, he had taken up shooting as a
martial
exercise, inasmuch as the burning of
gunpowder
was an attendant of the recreation.
He had never killed but one bird in his life,
and that was an owl, of whom he took the
advantage of day-light and his stocking feet,
to knock off a tree in the deanery grounds
very early after his arrival. In his trials with
John, he sometimes pulled trigger at the same
moment with his companion; and as the
bird generally fell, why he had certainly an
equal claim to the honour. He was fond of
warring with crows, and birds of the larger
sort, and invariably went provided with small
balls fitted to the bore of his fowling piece for
such accidental rencontres. He had another
habit, which was not a little annoying to
John, and who had several times tried in vain
to break him of, that of shooting at marks.
If birds were not plenty, he would throw up
a chip, and sometimes his hat, by the way of
shooting on the wing.
As the day was excessively hot, and the
game kept close, John felt willing to return
from such unprofitable labour. The captain
now commenced his chip firing, which in a
few minutes was succeeded by his hat.
See, Moseley, see, I have hit the band,
cried the captain, delighted to find he had at
last wounded his old antagonist; I don't
think you can beat that yourself.
I am not sure I can, said John, slipping
a handful of gravel in the muzzle of his piece
slily, but I can do as you did, try.
Do, cried the captain, pleased to get
his companion down to his own level of
amusement
,
are you ready?
Yes, throw.
Jarvis threw, and John fired; the hat
fairly
bouncedHave I hit it? asked John
coolly, while reloading the barrel he had
discharged
.
Hit it? said the captain, looking
ruefully
at his hat, it looks like a cullender;
but Moseley, your gun don't scatter well;
here must have been a dozen shot have gone
through in a place.
It does look rather like a cullender,
said John, as he overlooked his companion's
observations on the state of his beaver, and
by the
size
of some of the holes, one that has
been a good deal used.
The reports of the fowling pieces
announced
to the party in the arbour the return of
the sportsmen; it being an invariable
practice
with John Moseley, to discharge his gun
before he came in, and Jarvis had imitated
him, from a wish to be, what he called, in
rules.
Mr. Denbigh, said John archly, as he
put down his gun, Captain Jarvis has got
the better of his hat at last. Denbigh smiled
without speaking; and the captain, unwilling
to have any thing to say to a gentleman to
whom he had been obliged to apologize for
his five hundred pounds, went into the
arbour
to show the mangled condition of his
head-piece to the colonel, on whose
sympathies
he felt a kind of claim, being of the
same corps. John complained of thirst, and
went to a little run of water, but a short
distance
from them, in order to satisfy it. The
interruption of Jarvis was particularly
unseasonable
.
Jane was relating, in a manner
peculiar
to herself, and in which was mingled
that undefinable exchange of looks lovers are
so fond of, some incident of her early life to the
colonel, that greatly interested him; knowing
the captain's foibles, he pointed with his
finger, as he said,
There is one of your enemies, a hawk.
Jarvis threw down his hat, and ran with
boyish eagerness to drive away the intruder.
In his haste, he caught up the gun of John
Moseley, and loading it rapidly, threw in a
ball from his usual stock; but whether it was
that the hawk saw and knew him, or whether
it saw something else it liked better, it made
a dart for the baronet's poultry yard at no
great distance, and was out of sight in a
minute
.
Seeing his mark had vanished, the
captain laid the piece where he had found it,
and recovering his old train of ideas, picked
up his hat again.
John, said Emily, as she approached
him affectionately, you were too warm to
drink.
Stand off, sir, cried John playfully,
having
taken up his gun from against the body
of the tree, and dropping it towards her
Jarvis had endeavoured to make an appeal
to the commiseration of Emily, in favour of
his neglected beaver, and was within a few
feet of them; at this moment, recoiling from
the muzzle of the gun, he exclaimed, it is
VOL. I. 17
loaded. Hold, cried Denbigh, in a voice
of horror, as he sprang between John and his
sister. Both were too late; the piece was
discharged. Denbigh turning to Emily, and
smiling mournfully, gazed for a moment at
her, with an expression of tenderness, of
pleasure of sorrow, so blended, that she
retained
the recollection of it for life, and then
fell at her feet.
The gun dropt from the nerveless grasp of
young Moseley. Emily sunk in insensibility
by the side of her preserver. Mrs. Wilson
and Jane stood speechless and aghast. The
colonel alone retained a presence of mind so
necessary to devise the steps to be
immediately
taken. He sprung to the examination
of Denbigh; his eyes were open, and his
recollection perfect: they were fixed in
intense
observation on the inanimate body
which laid by his side.
Leave me, Colonel Egerton, he said,
speaking with difficulty, and pointing in the
direction of the little run of water, assist
Miss Moseleyyour hatyour hat will
answer
.
Accustomed to scenes of blood, and not
ignorant that time and care were the
remedies
to be applied to the wounded man,
Egerton flew to the stream, and returning
immediately, by the help of her sister and
Mrs. Wilson, soon restored Emily to life.
The ladies and John had now begun to act.
The tenderest assiduities of Jane were
devoted
to her sister, while Mrs. Wilson,
observing
her niece to be uninjured by any thing
but the shock, assisted John in supporting the
wounded man.
He spoke, requesting to be carried to the
house; and Jarvis was despatched for help:
within half an hour, Denbigh was placed on
a couch in the mansion of Sir Edward, and
quietly waiting for that professional aid,
which could only decide on his probable fate.
The group assembled in the room, were
waiting in fearful expectation the arrival of
the surgeons, in pursuit of whom messengers
had been sent, both to the barracks in F
and to the town itself. Sir Edward sat by
the side of the sufferer, holding one of his
hands in his own, now turning his tearful
eyes on that daughter who had so lately been
rescued as it were from the certainty of death
in mute gratitude and thanksgiving; and now
dwelling on the countenance of him, who,
by barely interposing his bosom to the blow,
had incurred in his own person, the imminent
danger of a similar fate, with a painful sense
of his perilous situation, and devout and
earnest
prayers for his safety. Emily was with her
father, as with the rest of his family, a decided
favourite; and no reward would have been
sufficient, no gratitude lively enough, in the
estimation of the baronet, to compensate the
defender of such a child. She sat between
her mother and Jane, with a hand held by
each, pale and opprest with a load of
gratitude
,
of thanksgiving, of wo, that almost
bowed her to the earth. Lady Moseley and
Jane were both sensibly touched with the
deliverance
of Emily, and manifested the
interest
they took in her by the tenderest caresses,
while Mrs. Wilson sat calmly collected
within
herself, occasionally giving those few
directions
which were necessary under the
circumstances
,
and offering up her silent
petitions
in behalf of the sufferer. John had
taken horse immediately for F, and
Jarvis
had volunteered to go to the rectory and
Bolton. Denbigh inquired frequently and
with much anxiety for Dr. Ives; but the
rector
was absent from home on a visit to a sick
parishioner, and it was late in the evening
before he arrived. Within three hours of the
accident, however, Dr. Black, the surgeon of
theth, reached the Hall, and
immediately
proceeded to the examination of the wound.
The ball had penetrated the right breast, and
gone directly through the body; it was
extracted
with very little difficulty, and his
attendant
acquainted the anxious friends of
Denbigh, the heart had certainly, and he
hoped the lungs had escaped uninjured; the
ball was a very small one, and the danger to
be apprehended was from fever: he had
taken
the usual precautions against it, and
should it not set in with a violence greater
than he apprehended at present, the patient
might be abroad within the month; but,
continued the surgeon with the hardened
indifference
of his profession, the gentleman
has had a narrow chance in the passage of
the ball itself; half an inch would have
settled
his accounts with this world. This
information
greatly relieved the family, and
orders were given to preserve a silence in the
house that would favour the patient's
disposition
to quiet, or, if possible, sleep.
Dr. Ives now reached the Hall. Mrs.
Wilson had never seen the rector in the
agitation
,
or want of self-command he was in,
as she met him at the entrance of the house
Is he alive?is there hope?where is
George?cried the doctor as he caught the
extended hand of Mrs. Wilson; she briefly
acquainted him with the surgeon's report,
and the reasonable ground there was to
expect
Denbigh would survive the injury.---
May God be praised, said the rector, in a
suppressed voice, and he hastily withdrew
into a parlour. Mrs. Wilson followed him
slowly and in silence, but was checked on her
opening the door, with the sight of the rector
on his knees, and the big tear stealing down his
venerable cheeks in quick succession.
Surely
,
thought the widow, as she drew back
unnoticed
,
a youth capable of exciting such
affection in a man like Dr. Ives, as he now
manifests, cannot be an unworthy one.
Denbigh hearing of the arrival of his friend
17*
desired to see him alone: their conference
was short, and the rector returned from it with
increased hopes of the termination of this
dreadful accident. He immediately left
the hall for his own house, with a
promise
of returning early on the following
morning.
During the night, however, the symptoms
became unfavourable; and before the return
of Dr. Ives, Denbigh was in a state of
delirium
from the height of his fever, and the
apprehensions
of his friends renewed with
additional
force.
What, what, my good sir, do you think
of him? said the baronet to the family
physician
,
with an emotion that the danger of his
dearest child would not have exceeded, and
within hearing of most of his children, who
were collected in the anti-chamber of the
room Denbigh was placed in. It is
impossible
to say, Sir Edward, replied the
physician
,
he refuses all medicines, and unless
this fever abates, there is but little hopes of
his recovery.
Emily stood during this question and
answer
,
motionless, pale as death, and with
her hands clasped together; betraying by
the workings of her fingers in a kind of
convulsive motion, the intensity of her
interest
;
she had seen the draught prepared,
which it was so desirable for Denbigh to
take, and it now stood rejected on a table in
view through the open door of his room
---almost breathless she glided to where it
was put, and taking it in her hand, she
approached
the bed, by which sat John alone,
listening with a feeling of despair to the
wanderings of the sick man; Emily
hesitated
once or twice, as she drew near to
Denbigh; her face had lost the paleness
of anxiety, and glowed with some other
emotion.
Mr. Denbigh---dear Denbigh, said
Emily, with energy, and unconsciously
dropping
her voice into the softest notes of
persuasion
;
will you refuse me?me, Emily
Moseley, whose life you have saved? and
she offered him the salutary beverage.
Emily Moseley! repeated Denbigh, after
her, and in those tones so remarkable to his
natural voice, is she safe? I thought she
was killed---dead; and then, as if
recollecting
somewhat, he gazed intently on her
countenance---his eye became less
fiery---his
muscles relaxed---he smiled, and took
without opposition the prescribed medicines
from her hand. He still wandered in his
language
,
but his physician, profiting by the
command Emily possessed over his patient,
increased his care, and by night his fever
had abated, and before morning he was in a
profound sleep. During the whole day, it
was thought necessary to keep Emily by the
side of his bed; but at times it was no
trifling tax on her feelings to remain there;
he spoke of her by name in the tenderest
manner, although incoherently, and in terms
that restored to the blanched cheeks of the
distressed girl, more than the richness of
their native colour. His thoughts were not
confined to Emily, however; he talked of
his father---of his mother, and frequently
spoke of his poor deserted Marian---the
latter
name he dwelt on in the language of the
warmest affection---condemned his own
desertion
of herand, taking Emily for her,
would beg her forgiveness---tell her, her
sufferings had been enough, and that he
would return and never leave her again. At
such moments, his nurse would sometimes
show, by the paleness of her cheeks again,
her anxiety for his health, and then, as he
addressed
her by her proper appellation, all her
emotions appeared absorbed in a sense of the
shame his praises overwhelmed her with, as
he became more placid with the decrease of
his fever. Mrs Wilson succeeded her in
the charge of the patient; and she retired to
seek that repose she so greatly needed. On
the second morning after receiving the wound,
he dropped into a deep sleep, from which he
awoke perfectly refreshed and collected in
his mind. The fever had left him, and his
attendants pronounced, with the usual
caution
to prevent a relapse, his recovery
certain
.
It were impossible to have
communicated
any intelligence more grateful to all the
members of the Moseley family; for Jane
had even lost sight of her own lover, from her
sympathy in the fate of a man she supposed
to be her sister's.
CHAPTER XIX.
The recovery of Denbigh was as rapid
as the most sanguine expectation of his
friends could justify; and in ten days from
the accident, he left his bed, and would sit for
an hour or two at a time in his dressing
room, where Mrs. Wilson, accompanied by
Jane or Emily, would come and read to him,
such books as they knew he was fond of;
and it was a remark of Sir Edward's
game-keeper
,
that the woodcocks had become so
tame, during the time Mr. Moseley was shut
up in attendance on his friend, that Captain
Jarvis was at last seen bringing home one.
As Jarvis felt something like a
consciousness
,
that but for his folly, the accident would
not have happened; and also something very
like shame, for the manner he had shrunk
from the danger Denbigh had met, he
pretended
a recal to his regiment then on duty
near London, and left the deanery. He went
off as he came in---in the colonel's tilbury,
and accompanied by his friend and his
pointers. John, who saw them pass from the
windows of Denbigh's dressing-room,
fervently
prayed he might never come back
again---the chip-shooting poacher.
Colonel Egerton had taken leave of Jane
the evening preceding, with the assurance of
the anxiety he should look forward to the
moment of their meeting at L, wither
he intended repairing, as soon as the corps he
belonged to had gone through its annual
review
.
Jane had followed the bent of her
natural feelings too much, during the period
of Denbigh's uncertain fate, to think much
on her lover, or any thing else but her
rescued sister and her preserver; but now
the former was pronounced in safety, and the
latter, by the very re-action of her grief, was
if possible happier than ever. Jane dwelt in
melancholy sadness on the perfections of the
man who had taken with him the best
affections
(as she thought) of her heartwith
him, all was perfect; his morals were
unexceptionable
,
his manners showed it; his
tenderness
of disposition manifest---they had
wept together over the distresses of more
than one fictitious heroine; his temper, how
amiable! he was never angry---she had
never seen it; his opinions---his tastes, how
correct! they were her own; his form, his
face, how agreeable, her eyes had seen it,
and her heart acknowledged it; besides, his
eyes confessed the power of her own charms;
he was brave, for he was a soldierin short,
as Emily had predicted, he was a hero---for
he was Colonel Egerton.
Had Jane been possessed of less
exuberance
of fancy, she might have been a little
at a loss to have identified all those good
properties with her hero, or had she
possessed
a matured or well regulated
judgment
to have controlled that fancy, they
might possibly have assumed a different
appearance
.
No explanation had taken place
between them, however; Jane knew, both
by her own feelings, and the legends of love,
from its earliest days, that the moment of
parting was generally a crisis in affairs of the
heart; and with a backwardness, occasioned
by her modesty, had rather avoided, than
sought an opportunity to favour the colonel's
wishes. Egerton had not been over anxious
to come to the point, and every thing was
left as heretoforeneither, however,
appeared
to doubt in the least the state of the other's
affections; and there might be said to exist
between them, one of those not unusual
engagements
,
by implication, which it would
have been (in their own estimation) a breach
of faith to have receded from, but which,
like all other bargains that are loosely made,
are sometimes violated, if convenient. Man
is a creature that, experience has sufficiently
proved, it is necessary to keep in his proper
place in society, by wholesome restrictions;
and we have often thought it a matter of
regret
,
that some well-understood regulations
did not exist, by which it became not only
customary, but incumbent on him, to
proceed
in his road to the temple of hymen
we know that it is ungenerous, ignoble,
almost
unprecedented, to doubt the faith, the
constancy, of a male paragon; yet,
somehow
,
as the papers occasionally give us a
sample of such infidelity---as we have
sometimes
seen a solitary female brooding over
her woes in silence, and with the seemliness
of feminine decorum, shrinking from the
discovery
of its cause and its effects she has in
vain hoped to escape; or which the grave
has revealed for the first time; we cannot
but wish, that either the watchfulness of the
parent, or a sense of self-preservation in the
daughter, would for the want of a better,
cause them to adhere to those old
conventional
forms of courtship, which requires a
man to speak to be understood, and a woman
to answer to be committed.
There was a little parlour in the house of
Sir Edward Moseley, that was the
privileged
retreat of none but the members of
his own family; it was here that the ladies
were accustomed to withdraw into the bosom
of their domestic quietude, when occasional
visiters had disturbed their ordinary
intercourse
,
and many were the hasty and
unreserved
communications it had witnessed from
the sisters, in their stolen flights from the
gayer scenes of the principal apartments; it
might be said to be sacred to the pious
feelings
of the domestic affections. Sir Edward
would retire to it when fatigued with his
occupations, certain of finding some one of
those he loved to draw his thoughts off from
the cares of life to the little incidents of his
children's happiness; and Lady Moseley,
even in the proudest hours of her reviving
VOL. I. 18
splendour, seldom passed the door without
looking in, with a smile, on the faces she
might find there; it was, in fact, the room in
the large mansion of the baronet, expressly
devoted, by long usage and common consent,
to the purest feelings of human nature. Into
this apartment Denbigh had gained
admission
,
as the one nearest to his own room,
and requiring the least effort of his
returning
strength to reach, and, perhaps, by an
undefinable feeling of the Moseleys which
had begun to connect him with themselves
partly from his winning manners, and partly
by the sense of the obligation he had laid
them under.
One warm day, John and his friend had
sought this retreat, in expectation of meeting
his sisters, who they found, however, on
inquiry, had walked to the arbour; after
remaining
conversing for an hour by
themselves
,
John was called away to attend to a
pointer that had been taken sick, and
Denbigh
throwing a handkerchief over his head
to guard against the danger of cold, quietly
composed himself on one of the comfortable
sofas of the room, with a disposition to
sleep; before he had entirely lost his
consciousness
,
a light step moving near him,
caught his ear; believing it to be a servant
unwilling to disturb him, he endeavoured to
continue in his present mood, until the quick,
but stifled breathing, of some one nearer to
him than before, roused his curiosity; he
commanded himself. however, sufficiently to
remain quiet; a blind of a window near him
was carefully closed; a screen drawn from
a corner and placed so as sensibly to destroy
the slight draught of air in which he laid
himself from the excessive heat; and other
arrangements were making, but with a care
to avoid disturbing him, that rendered them
hardly audiblepresently the step
approached
him again, the breathing was quicker
though gentle, the handkerchief moved
but the hand was withdrawn hastily as if
afraid of itselfanother effort was
successful
,
and Denbigh stole a glance through his
dark lashes, on the figure of Emily as she
stood over him in the fullness of her charms,
and with a face, in which glowed an emotion
of interest he had never witnessed in it
before
;
it undoubtedly was
gratitude
. For a
moment she gazed on him, as her colour
increased
in richness. His hand was
carelessly
thrown over an arm of the sofa; she
stooped towards it with her face gently, but
with an air of modesty that shone in her
very figureDenbigh felt the warmth of her
breath, but her lips did not touch it. Had
Denbigh been inclined to judge the actions
of Emily Moseley harshly, it were
impossible
to mistake the movement for any thing
but the impulse of natural feelingthere
was a pledge of innocence, of modesty in
her countenance, that would have prevented
any misconstruction; and he continued
quietly awaiting what the preparations on
her little mahogany secretary were intended
for.
Mrs. Wilson entertained a great
abhorrence
of what is commonly called
accomplishments
in a woman; she knew that too
much of that precious time, which could
never be recalled, was thrown away in
endeavouring
to acquire a smattering in what,
if known, could never be of use to the
party, and what can never be well known
but to a few, whom nature, and long
practice
,
have enabled to conquer; yet as her
mind had early manifested a taste for
painting
,
and a vivid perception of the beauties of
nature, her inclination had been indulged,
and Emily Moseley sketched with great
neatness and accuracy, and no little
despatch
.
It would have been no subject of
surprise
,
had admiration, or some more
powerful
feeling, betrayed to the maid, the
deception
which the young man, whose features
she was now studying, was practising on
her
unsuspicion
. She had entered the room
from her walk, warm and careless; her hair,
than which none was more beautiful, had
strayed on her shoulders, freed from the
confinement
of the comb, and a lock was finely
contrasted with the rich colour of her cheek,
that almost burnt with the exercise and the
excitementher dress, white as the first
snow of the winter; her looks, as she now
turned them on the face of the sleeper, and
now betrayed by their animation the
success
of her art, formed a picture in itself,
that Denbigh might have been content to
have gazed on forever. Her back was to a
window, that threw its strong light on the
paper; whose figures were reflected, as she
occasionally held it up to study its effect
in a large mirror, so fixed that Denbigh
caught a view of her subjecthe knew it
at a glancethe arbourthe gunhimself,
all were there; it appeared to have been
drawn beforeit must have been, from its
perfect state, and Emily had seized a
favourable
moment to complete his resemblance.
Her touches were light and finishing, and as
the picture was frequently held up for
consideration
,
he had some time allowed for
studying it. His own resemblance was
strong; his eyes were turned on herself, to
whom Denbigh thought she had not done
ample justicebut the man who held the
gun, bore no likeness to John Moseley,
except
in dress. A slight movement of the
muscles of the sleeper's mouth, might have
betrayed his consciousness, had not Emily
been too intent on the picture, as she turned
it in such a way, that a strong light fell on
the recoiling figure of Captain Jarvisthe
resemblance
was wonderfulDenbigh thought
he would have known it, had he seen it in the
academy itself. The noise of some one
approaching
closed the port-folioit was only
18*
a servant; yet Emily did not resume her
pencil. Denbigh watched her motions, as
she put the picture carefully in a private
drawer of the secretaryreopened the blind,
replaced the screen, and laid the
handkerchief
,
the last thing, on his face, with a
movement
almost imperceptible to himself.
It is later than I thought it, said
Denbigh
,
looking at his watch, I owe an
apology
,
Miss Moseley, for making so free with
your parlour; but I was too lazy to move.
Apology! Mr. Denbigh, cried Emily,
with a colour varying with every word she
spoke, and trembling, at what she thought
the nearness of detection, you have no
apology to make for your present debility;
and surelysurely, least of all to me.
I understand from Mr. Moseley,
continued
Denbigh, with a smile, that our
obligation is at least mutual; to your
perseverance
and care, Miss Moseley, after
the physicians had given me up, I believe
I am, under Providence, indebted for my
recovery
.
Emily was not vain, and least of all addicted
to a display of any of her acquirements; very
few even of her friends knew she ever held a
pencil in her hand; yet did she now
unaccountably
throw open her port-folio, and
offer its contents to the examination of her
companion; it was done almost
instantaneously
,
and with great freedom, though not
without certain flushings of the face, and
heavings of the bosom, that would have
eclipsed Grace Chatterton in her happiest
moments of natural flattery. Whatever might
have been the wishes of Mr. Denbigh, to
pursue a subject which had begun to grow
extremely interesting, both from its import
and the feelings of the parties it would
have been rude to have declined viewing the
contents of a lady's port-folio. The
drawings
were, many of them, interesting, and the
exhibiter of them now appeared as anxious
to remove them in haste, as she had but the
moment before been to direct his attention to
her performance. Denbigh would have given
much to have dared to ask for the paper so
carefully secreted in the private drawer; but
neither the principal agency he had himself
in the scene, nor delicacy to his companion's
evident wish for concealment, would allow of
the request.
Doctor Ives! how happy I am to see
you, said Emily, hastily closing her
portfolio
,
and before Denbigh had gone half
through its contents, you have become
almost
a stranger to us, since Clara has left us.
No, no, my little friend, never a stranger,
I hope, at Moseley Hall, cried the doctor,
pleasantly; George, I am happy to see you
look so wellyou have even a colour
there is a letter for you from Marian.
Denbigh took the letter eagerly, and
retired
to a window to peruse ithis hand
shook as he broke the seal, and his interest in
the writer or its contents, could not have
escaped
the notice of any observer, however
indifferent.
Now, Miss Emily, if you will have the
goodness to order me a glass of wine and
water, after my ride, believe me, you will do
a very charitable act, cried the doctor, as
he took his seat on the sopha. Emily was
standing by the little table, deeply musing on
the qualities of her port-folio; for her eyes
were fixed on its outside intently, as if she
expected to see its contents through the
leather covering.
Miss Emily Moseley, continued the
doctor, gravely, am I to die of thirst or not,
this warm day.
Do you wish any thing, Doctor Ives,
said Emily, as he passed her in order to ring
the bell.
Only a servant to get me some wine and
water.
Why did you not ask me, my dear sir,
said Emily, as she threw open a cellaret, and
handed him what he wanted.
There, my dear, there is a great plenty,
said the doctor, with an arch expression, I
really thought I had asked you thricebut I
believe you were studying something in that
port-folio. Emily blushed, and endeavoured
to laugh at her own absence of mind; but
she would have given the world to know who
Marian was.
CHAPTER XX.
As a month had elapsed since the receiving
of his wound, Denbigh took an opportunity
one morning at breakfast, where he was well
enough now to meet his friends, to announce
his intention of trespassing no longer on
their kindness, but of returning that day to
the rectory; the communication distressed
the whole family, and the baronet turned to
him in the most cordial manner, as he took
one of his hands, and said, with an air of
solemnity,
Mr. Denbigh, I could wish you to make
this house your home; Doctor Ives may
have known you longer, and may have ties
of blood upon you, but I am certain he
cannot
love you better; and are not the ties of
gratitude as binding as those of blood?
Denbigh was affected by the kindness of
Sir Edward's manner, as he replied,
The regiment I belong to, Sir Edward, will
be reviewed next week, and it has become my
duty to leave here; there is one it is proper I
should visit, a near connexion, who is
acquainted
with the escape I have met with,
and wishes naturally to see me; besides, my
dear Sir Edward, she has many causes of
sorrow, and it is a debt I owe her affection to
endeavour to relieve them. It was the first
time he had ever spoken of his family, or
hardly of himself; and the silence which
prevailed, plainly showed the interest the
listeners took in the little he uttered.
That connexion, thought Emily, I
wonder
if her name be Marian. But nothing
further passed, excepting the affectionate
regrets
of her father, and the promises of
Denbigh
to visit them again before he left B,
and of joining them at Limmediately
after the review he spoke of. As soon as he
had breakfasted, John drove him in his
phaeton
to the rectory.
Mrs. Wilson, like the rest of the baronet's
family, had been too deeply impressed with
the debt they owed to this young man, to
interfere
with her favourite system of caution,
against too great an intimacy between her
niece and her preserver. Close observation,
and the opinion of Dr. Ives, had prepared
her to give him her esteem; but the gallantry,
the self-devotion he had displayed to Emily,
was an act calculated to remove heavier
objections
than she could imagine as likely to
exist, to his becoming her husbandthat he
meant it, was evident from his whole
deportment
of late. Since the morning the
portfolio
was produced, Denbigh had given a
more decided preference to her niece. The
nice discrimination of Mrs. Wilson would not
have said his feelings had become stronger,
but that he laboured less to conceal them
that he loved her niece, she suspected from
the first fortnight of their acquaintance, and
it had given additional stimulus to her
investigation
into her characterbut to doubt it,
after stepping between her and death, would
have been to have mistaken human nature.
There was one qualification, she would have
wished to have been certain he possessed;
before this accident, she would have made
it an indispensible one; but the gratitude
the affections of Emily, she believed now to
be too deeply engaged to make the strict
inquiry
she otherwise would have done, and
she had the best of reasons for believing that
if Denbigh were not a professing Christian,
he was at least a strictly moral man, and
assuredly
,
one who well understood the
beauties
of a religion, she almost conceived it
impossible
for any impartial and intelligent
man to resist long; perhaps Mrs. Wilson,
owing to circumstances without her control,
had in some measure interfered with her
systemlike others, had, on finding it
impossible
to conduct so that reason would
justify
all she did, began to find reasons for
what she thought best to be done under
the circumstances. Denbigh had, however,
both by his acts and his opinions, created
such an estimate of his worth, in the breast
of Mrs. Wilson, that there would have been
but little danger of a repulse, had no
fortuitous
accident helped him in his way to her
favour.
Who have we here, said Lady Moseley;
a landaulet and fourthe Earl of Bolton,
I declare; and Lady Moseley turned from
the window, with that collected grace she so
well loved, and so well knew how to assume,
to receive her noble visiter. Lord Bolton
was a bachelor of sixty-five, who had long
been attached to the court, and had retained
much of the manners of the old school; his
principle estate was in Ireland, and most of
that time which his duty at Windsor did
not require, he gave to the improvement of
his Irish property; thus, although on
perfectly
good terms with the baronet's family,
they seldom metwith General Wilson he
had been at college, and to his widow he
always
showed much of that regard he had
invariably professed to her husband. The
obligation he had conferred, unasked, on
Francis Ives, was one conferred on all his
friends; and his reception was now warmer
than usual.
My Lady Moseley, said the earl,
bowing
on her hand, your looks do ample
justice
to the air of Northamptonshire. I hope
your ladyship enjoys your usual health; and
then waiting her equally courteous answer,
he paid his compliments, in succession, to all
the members of the family; a mode
undoubtedly
well adapted to discover their
several
conditions, but not a little tedious in
its operations, and somewhat tiresome to the
legs.
We are under a debt of gratitude to your
lordship, said Sir Edward, in his simple and
warm-hearted way, that I am sorry it is
not in our power to repay more amply than
by our thanks.
The earl was, or affected to be, surprised,
as he required an explanation.
The living at Bolton, my lord, said
Lady Moseley, with dignity. Yes,
continued
her husband; your lordship, in giving
the living to Frank, did me a favour, equal
to what you would have done, had he been
my own childand unsolicited too, my lord,
it was an additional compliment.
The earl sat rather uneasy during this
speech, but the love of truth prevailed, for
he had been too much round the person of
our beloved sovereign, not to retain all the
impressions of his youth; and after a little
struggle with his self love, answered,
Not unsolicited, Sir Edward. I have
no doubt had my better fortune allowed me
the acquaintance of my present rector, his
own merit would have obtained, what a sense
of justice requires I should say was granted
to an applicant, the ear of royalty would not
have been deaf to.
It was the turn of the Moseleys now to
look surprised, and Sir Edward ventured to
ask an explanation.
It was my cousin, the Earl of
Pendennyss
,
who applied to me for it, as a favour
done to himself; and Pendennyss is a man not
to be refused any thing.
Lord Pendennyss, exclaimed Mrs.
VOL. I. 19
Wilson, with animation, and in what way
came we to be under this obligation to his
lordship?
He did me the honour of a call, during
my visit to Ireland, madam, replied the
earl, and on inquiring of my steward after
his old friend, Doctor Stevens, learnt his
death, and the claims of Mr. Ives; but the
reason he gave me, was his interest in the
widow of General Wilson, bowing with
much solemnity to the lady as he spoke.
I am gratified to find the earl yet
remembers
us, said Mrs. Wilson, struggling
to restrain her tears; are we to have the
pleasure of seeing him soon?
I received a letter from him yesterday,
saying he should be here in all next week,
madam; and turning pleasantly to Jane and
her sister, he continued, Sir Edward, you
have here rewards fit for heavier services, and
the earl is a great admirer of female charms.
Is he not married, my lord? asked the
baronet, with great simplicity.
No, baronet, nor engaged; but how long
he will remain so after his hardihood in
venturing
into this neighbourhood, will, I trust,
depend on one of these young ladies.
Jane looked gravefor trifling on love was
heresy in her estimation; but Emily laughed,
with an expression in which a skilful
physiognomist
might have readif he means me,
he is mistaken.
Your cousin, Lord Chatterton, has found
interest, Sir Edward, continued the peer,
to obtain his father's situation; and if reports
speak truth, he wishes to become more nearly
related to you, baronet.
I do not well see how that can happen,
said Sir Edward, with a smile, and who had
not art enough to conceal his thoughts,
unless
he takes my sister, here.
The cheeks of both the young ladies now
vied with the rose; and the peer observing he
had touched on forbidden ground, added,
Chatterton was fortunate to find friends able
to bear up against the powerful interest of
Lord Haverford.
To whom was he indebted for the place,
my lord? asked Mrs. Wilson.
It was whispered at court, madam, said
the earl, sensibly lowering his voice, and
speaking with an air of mystery, a lord of
the bed-chamber is fonder of, than a lord of
the council-board, that His Grace of
Derwent
threw the whole of his parliamentary
interest into the scale on the baron's side
but you are not to suppose, raising his hand
gracefully, with a wave of rejection, that
I speak from authority; only a surmise, Sir
Edwardonly a surmise, my lady.
Is not the name of the Duke of
Derwent
,
Denbigh? inquired Mrs. Wilson, with
a thoughtful manner.
Certainly, madamDenbigh, replied
the earl, with a gravity with which he always
spoke of dignities, one of our most ancient
names, and descended on the female side,
from the Plantagenets and Tudors.
He now rose to take his leave, and on
bowing to the younger ladies, laughingly
repeated his intention of bringing his cousin
(an epithet he never omitted) Pendennyss to
their feet.
Do you think, sister, said Lady Moseley,
after the earl had retired, that Mr. Denbigh
is of the house of Derwent?
I cannot say, replied Mrs. Wilson,
musing, yet it is oddChatterton told me
of his acquaintance with Lady Harriet
Denbigh
,
but not with the duke. As this was
spoken in the manner of a soliloquy, it
received
no answer, and was in fact but little
attended to by any of the party, excepting
Emily, who glanced her eye once or twice
at her aunt as she was speaking, with an
interest
the name of Denbigh never failed to
excite. Harriet was, she thought, a pretty
name, but Marian was a prettier; if, thought
Emily, I could know a Marian Denbigh,
I am sure I could love her, and her name
too.
The Moseleys now began to make their
preparations for their departure to L,
and the end of the succeding week was fixed
for the period at which they were to go;
Mrs. Wilson urged a delay of two or three
days, in order to give her an opportunity of
meeting with the Earl of Pendennyss, a
young man in whom, although she had
relinquished
her former romantic wish of
uniting him to Emily, in favour of Denbigh,
she yet felt a deep interest, growing out of his
connexion with the last moments of her
husband
,
and his uniformly high character.
Sir Edward accordingly acquainted his
uncle, that on the following Saturday he
might expect to receive himself and family,
intending to leave the hall in the afternoon
of the preceding day, and reach Benfield
Lodge to dinner; this arrangement once
made, and Mr. Benfield notified of it, was
unalterable
,
the old man holding a variation
from an engagement a deadly sin. The week
succeeding the accident, which had nearly
proved so fatal to Denbigh, the inhabitants
of the hall were surprised with the approach
of a being, as singular in his manners and
dress, as the equipage which conveyed him
to the door of the mansionthe latter
consisted
of a high-backed, old-fashioned sulky,
loaded with leather and large headed brass
nails; wheels at least a quarter larger in
circumference
than those of the present day,
and wings on each side, large enough to have
supported a full grown roc, in the highest
regions of the upper airit was drawn by a
horse, once white, but whose milky hue was
tarnished, through age, with large and
numerous
red spots, and whose mane and tail did
not appear to have suffered by the shears
during the present reign. The being who
alighted from this antiquated vehicle, was tall
19*
and excessively thin, wore his own hair
drawn over his almost naked head, into a
long thin cue, which reached half way down
his back, closely cased in numerous
windings
of leather, or skin of some fish. His
drab coat was in shape between a frock and
close-bodyclose-body, indeed, it was; for
the buttons, which were in size about equal
to an old-fashioned China saucer, were
buttoned to the very throat, and thereby
setting
off his shapes to peculiar advantage; his
breeches were buckskin, and much soiled;
his stockings blue yarn, although it was
midsummer
;
and his shoes provided with buckles
of dimensions proportionate to the
aforesaid
buttons; his age might have been
seventy
,
but his walk was quick, and the
movements
of his whole system showed great
activity
both of mind and body. He was
ushered
into the room where the gentlemen
were sitting, and having made a low and
extremely
modest bow, deliberately put on
his spectacles, thrust his hand into an outside
pocket of his coat, and produced, from under
its huge flaps, a black leather pocket-book,
about as large as a good sized octavo volume;
after examining the multitude of papers it
contained carefully, he selected a letter, and
having returned the pocket-book to its
ample
apartment, read aloudFor Sir
Edward
Moseley, bart. of Moseley Hall, B,
Northamptonshirewith care and speed, by
the hands of Mr. Peter Johnson, steward of
Benfield Lodge, Norfolk; and dropping
his sharp voice, he stalked up to where the
baronet stood, and presented the epistle, with
another reverence.
Ah, my good friend Johnson, said Sir
Edward, as soon as he delivered his errand,
(for until he saw the contents of the letter,
he had thought some accident had occurred
to his uncle,) this is the first visit you have
ever honoured me with; come, take a
glass of wine before you go to your dinner
drink that you hope it may not be the
last.
Sir Edward Moseley, and you
honourable
gentlemen, will pardon me, replied the
steward, in his solemn keys, this is the
first time I was ever out of his majesty's
county of Norfolk, and I devoutly wish it
may prove the lastGentlemen, I drink
your honourable healths.
This was the only real speech the old man
made during his visit, unless an occasional
monosyllabic reply to a question could be
thought so. He remained, by Sir Edward's
positive order, until the following day; for
having delivered his message, and received
its answer, he was about to take his
departure
that evening, thinking he might get
a good piece on his road homeward, as it
wanted a half an hour yet to sundown. On
the following morning, with the sun, he was
on his way to the house in which he had
been born, and which he had never left for
twenty-four hours at a time, in his life. In
the evening, as he was ushered in by John
(who had known him from his own childhood,
and loved to show him attentions) to the
room in which he was to sleep, he broke,
what the young man called, his inveterate
silence, with, young Mr. Moseleyyoung
gentlemanmight I presumeto askto see
the gentleman.
What gentleman? cried John, in
astonishment
,
both at the request, and his
speaking
so much.
That saved Miss Emmy's life, sir. John
now fully
comprehended
him, and led the
way to Denbigh's room; he was asleep, but
they were admitted to his bed-side; the
steward stood for good ten minutes, gazing
on the sleeper in silence; and John observed,
as he blew his nose, on regaining his own
apartment, his little gray eyes twinkled with
a lustre, that could not be taken for any thing
but a tear.
As the letter was as characteristic of the
writer, as its bearer was of his vocation,
we may be excused giving it at length.
Dear Sir Edward and Nephew,
Your letter reached the lodge too late to
be answered that evening, as I was about
to step into my bed; but I hasten to write
my congratulations; remembering the often
repeated maxim of my kinsman Lord
Gosford
,
that letters should be answered
immediately
;
indeed, a neglect of it had very nigh
brought about an affair of honour between the
earl and Sir Stephens Hallett. Sir Stephens
was always opposed to us in the house of
commons of this realm; and I have often
thought it might have been something passed
in the debate itself, which commenced the
correspondence, as the earl certainly told him
as much, as if he were a traitor to his king
and country.
But it seems that your daughter Emily,
has been rescued from death, by the
grandson
of General Denbigh, who sat with us in
the houseNow I always had a good
opinion
of this young Denbigh, who reminds
me every time I look at him, of my late
brother
,
your father-in-law, that was; and I
send my steward, Peter Johnson, express to
the hall, in order that he may see the sick
man, and bring me back a true account of
how he fares; for should he be wanting for
any thing within the gift of Roderic Benfield,
he has only to speak to have it; not that I
suppose, nephew, you will willingly allow
him to suffer for any thing, but Peter is a
man of close observation, although he is of
few words, and may suggest something
beneficial
,
that might escape younger heads
I pray forthat is, I hope, the young man
will recover, as your letter gives great hopes,
and if he should want any little matter to
help him along in his promotion in the army,
as I take it he is not over wealthy, you
or a life of service, could entitle me to
receive
.
The baronet smiled his assent to a
request he already understood, and Denbigh
withdrew.
John Moseley had insisted on putting the
bays into requisition to carry Denbigh for
the first stage, and they now stood
caparisoned
for the jaunt, with their master in a less
joyous mood than common, waiting the
appearance
of his companion.
Emily delighted in their annual excursion
to Benfield Lodge; she was beloved so
warmly, and returned the affection of its
owner so sincerely, that the arrival of the
day never failed to excite that flow of spirits
which generally accompanies anticipated
pleasures, ere experience has proved how
trifling are the greatest enjoyments the scenes
of this life bestow. Yet as the day of their
departure drew near, her spirits sunk in
proportion
,
and on the morning of Denbigh's
leave-taking, Emily seemed any thing but
excessively happy; there was a tremour in
her voice, and redness about her eyes, that
alarmed Lady Moseley with the
apprehension
she had taken cold; but as the paleness
of her cheeks were immediately succeeded
with as fine a brilliancy of colour, as the
heart could wish, the anxious mother allowed
herself to be persuaded by Mrs. Wilson, there
was no danger, and accompanied her sister
to her own room for some purpose of
domestic
economy. It was at this moment
Denbigh
entered; he had paid his adieus to the
matrons at the door, and been directed by
them to the little parlour in quest of Emily.
I have come to make my parting
compliments
,
Miss Moseley, said he, in a
tremulous
voice, as he ventured to hold forth
his hand; may heaven preserve you, he
continued, holding it in fervour to his bosom,
and then dropping it, he hastily retired, as if
unwilling to trust himself any longer to utter
all he felt. Emily stood a few moments, pale,
and almost inanimate, as the tears flowed
rapidly
from her eyes, and then sought a
shelter in a seat of the window for her
person
and her sorrows. Lady Moseley, on
returning
,
was again alarmed lest the draught
would increase her indisposition; but her
sister, observing that the window commanded
a view of the road, thought the air too mild
to do her injury.
The personages who composed the society
at B, had now, in a great measure,
separated
,
in pursuit of their duties or their
pleasures. The merchant and his family left
the deanery for a watering place. Francis
and Clara had gone on a little tour of
pleasure
in the northern counties, to take L
in their return homeward; and the morning
arrived for the commencement of the
baronet's
journey to the same place. The
carriages
had been ordered, and servants were
running in various ways, busily employed in
their several occupations, when Mrs. Wilson,
VOL. I. 20
accompanied by John and his sisters,
returned
from a walk they had taken to avoid
the bustle of the house. A short distance
from the park gates, an equipage was
observed
approaching, creating by its numerous
horses and attendants, a dust which drove
the pedestrians to one side of the road; an
uncommonly elegant and admirably fitted
travelling barouche and six rolled by, with
the graceful steadiness of an English
equipage
;
several servants on horseback were in
attendance, and our little party were struck
with the beauty of the whole
establishment
.
Can it be possible, Lord Bolton drives
such elegant horses, cried John, with the
ardour of a connoisseur in that noble animal;
they are the finest set in the kingdom.
Jane's eye had seen, through the clouds of
dust, the armorial bearings, which seemed to
float in the dark glossy pannels of the carriage,
and answered, it is an earl's coronet, but
they are not the Bolton arms. Mrs.
Wilson
and Emily had noticed a gentleman
reclining
at his ease, as the owner of the
gallant
show; but its passage was too rapid to
enable them to distinguish the features of
the courteous old earl; indeed, Mrs. Wilson
remarked, she thought him a younger man
than her friend.
Pray, sir, said John, to a tardy groom,
as he civilly walked his horse by the ladies,
who has passed us in the barouche?
My Lord Pendennyss, sir.
Pendennyss! exclaimed Mrs. Wilson,
with a tone of regret, how unfortunate!
she had seen the day named for his visit
pass without his arrival, and now, as it was
too late to profit by the opportunity, he had
come for the second time into her
neighbourhood
.
Emily had learnt by the solicitude of
her aunt, to take an interest in the young
peer's movements, and desired John to ask a
question or two of the groom.
Where does your lord stop, to-night?
At Bolton Castle, sir, and I heard my lord
tell his valet that he intended staying one
day hereabouts, and on the day after the
morrow he goes to Wales, your honour.
I thank you, friend, said John; and the
man spurred his horse after the cavalcade.
The carriages were at the door, and Sir
Edward
had been hurrying Jane to enter, as a
servant, in a rich livery, and well mounted,
galloped up and delivered a letter for Mrs.
Wilson, who on opening it read the following:
The Earl of Pendennyss begs leave to
present his most respectful compliments to
Mrs. Wilson, and the family of Sir Edward
MoseleyLord Pendennyss will have the
honour of paying his respects in person at
any moment that the widow of his late
invaluable
friend, lieutenant-general Wilson,
will please to appoint.
Bolton Castle, Friday evening.
To this note Mrs. Wilson, bitterly
regretting
the necessity which compelled her to
forego the pleasure of meeting her paragon,
wrote in reply a short letter, disliking the
formality of a note.
My Lord,
I sincerely regret, that an engagement
which cannot be postponed, compels us to
leave Moseley Hall within the hour, and
must, in consequence, deprive us of the
pleasure
of your intended visit. But as
circumstances
have connected your lordship with
some of the dearest, although the most
melancholy
events of my life, I earnestly beg
you will no longer consider us as strangers to
your person, as we have long ceased to be
to your character. It will afford me the
greatest pleasure to hear that there will be a
prospect of our meeting in town this winter,
where I may find a more fitting opportunity
of expressing those grateful feelings so long
due to your lordship, from your sincere friend,
Charlotte Wilson
.
Moseley Hall, Friday morning.
With this answer the servant was
despatched
,
and the carriages moved on. John had
induced Emily to trust herself once more to
the bays and his skill; but on perceiving the
melancholy of her aunt, she insisted on
exchanging
seats with Jane, who had accepted
a place in the carriage of Mrs. Wilson. No
objection being made, Mrs. Wilson and her
niece rode the first afternoon together in her
travelling chaise. The road run within a
quarter
of a mile of Bolton Castle, and the ladies
endeavoured in vain to get a glimpse of the
person of the young nobleman. Emily was
willing to gratify her aunt's propensity to
dwell on the character and history of her
favourite
,
and hoping to withdraw her attention
gradually from more unpleasant recollections,
asked several trifling questions relating to
those points.
The earl must be very rich, aunt, from
the style he maintains.
Very, my dear; his family I am
unacquainted
with, but I understand his title is an
extremely ancient one; and some one, I
belive
Lord Bolton, mentioned that his estates
in Wales alone, exceeded fifty thousand a
year.
Much good might be done, said Emily
thoughtfully, with such a fortune.
Much good
is
done, cried her aunt with
fervour. I am told by every one who knows
him, his donations are large and frequent.
Sir Herbert Nicholson said he was
extremely
simple in his habits, and it leaves large
sums at his disposal every year.
The bestowal of money is not always
charity, said Emily with an arch smile and
slight colour. Mrs. Wilson smiled in her turn
as she answered, not always, but it is
charity
to hope for the best. Sir Herbert
20*
knew him then? said EmilyPerfectly
well; they were associated together in the
service for several years, and he spoke of him
with a fervour equal to my warmest
expectations
.
The Moseley arms in F, was
kept by an old butler of the family, and Sir
Edward every year, going and coming to
L, spent a night under its roof. He was
received by its master with a respect that none
who ever knew the baronet well, could
withhold
from his goodness of heart and many
virtues.
Well, Jackson, said the baronet kindly
as he was seated at the supper table, how
does custom increase with youI hope you
and the master of the Dun Cow are more
amicable than formerly.
Why, Sir Edward, replied the host, who
had lost a little of the deference of the
servant
in the landlord, but none of his real
respect
,
Mr. Daniels and I are more upon a
footing of late than we was, when your
goodness
enabled me to take the house; then he
got all the great travellers, and for more than a
twelvemonth I had not a title in my house
but yourself and a great London doctor, that
was called here to see a sick person in the
town. He had the impudence to call me the
knight, barrowknight, your honour, and we
had a quarrel upon that account.
I am glad, however, to find you are
gaining
in the rank of your customers, and trust,
as the occasion has ceased, you will be more
inclined to be good-natured to each other.
Why, as to good-nature, Sir Edward, I
lived with your honour ten years, and you
must know somewhat of my temper, said
Jackson, with the self-satisfaction of an
approving
conscience; but Sam Daniels is a
man who is never easy unless he is left
quietly
at the top of the ladder; however,
continued
the host, with a chuckle, I have given
him a dose lately.
How so, Jackson? inquired the
baronet
,
willing to gratify the man's evident wish
to relate his triumphs.
Your honour must have heard mention
made of a great lord, one Duke of Derwent;
well, Sir Edward, about six weeks agone he
past through with my Lord Chatterton.
Chatterton! exclaimed John,
interrupting
him, has he been so near us again, and
so lately?
Yes, Mr. Moseley, replied Jackson with
a look of importance; they dashed into my
yard with their chaise and four, with five
servants, and would you think it, Sir Edward,
they had'nt been in the house ten minutes,
before Daniel's son was fishing from the
servants
,
who they were; I told him, Sir Edward
---dukes don't come every day.
How came you to get his grace away
from the Dun Cowchance?
No, your honour, said the host,
pointing
to his sign, and bowing reverently to his
old master, the Moseley Arms did it. Mr.
Daniels used to taunt me with having worn
a livery, and has said more than once he
could milk his cow, but that your honour's
arms would never lift me into a comfortable
seat for life; so I just sent him a message by
the way of letting him know my good
fortune
,
your honour.
And what was it?
Only that your honour's arms had shoved
a duke and a baron into my house---that's
all.
And I suppose Daniels' legs shoved your
messenger out of his house, said John with
a laugh.
No, Mr. Moseley; Daniels would hardly
dare do that: but yesterday, your honour,
yesterday evening, beat every thing. Daniels
was seated before his door, and I was taking
a pipe at mine, Sir Edward, as a coach and
six, with servants upon servants, drove down
the street; it got near us, and the boys were
reining the horses into the yard of the Dun
Cow, as the gentleman in the coach saw my
sign: he sent a groom to inquire who kept
the house; I got up your honour, and told
him my name, sir. Mr. Jackson, said his
lordship, my respect for the family of Sir
Edward
Moseley is too great not to give my
custom to an old servant of his family.
Indeed, said the baronet; pray who
was my lord?
The Earl of Pendennyss, your honour.
Oh, he is a sweet gentleman, and he asked all
about my living with your honour, and about
madam Wilson.
Did his lordship stay the night,
inquired
Mrs. Wilson, excessively gratified at a
discovery
of the disposition manifested by the
earl towards her.
Yes, madam, he left here after breakfast.
What message did you send the Dun Cow
this time, Jackson? cried John laughing.
Jackson looked a little foolish, but the
question
being repeated, he answeredWhy,
sir, I was a little crowded for room, and so
your honour, so I just sent Tom across the
street, to know if Mr. Daniels could'nt keep
a couple of the grooms.
And Tom got his head broke.
No, Mr. John, the tankard missed him;
but if---
Very well, cried the baronet, willing to
change the conversation, you have been so
fortunate of late, you can afford to be
generous
;
and I advise you to cultivate harmony
with your neighbour, or I may take my arms
down, and you may lose your noble
visiters---see
my room prepared.
Yes, your honour, said the host, and
bowing respectfully, he withdrew.
At least, aunt, cried John pleasantly,
we have the pleasure of supping in the
same room with the puissant earl, albeit
there be twenty-four hours difference in the
time.
I sincerely wish there had not been that
difference, observed his father, taking his
sister kindly by the hand.
Such an equipage must have been a
harvest
indeed to Jackson, remarked the
mother
;
and they broke up for the evening.
The whole establishment at Benfield Lodge
were drawn up to receive them on the
following
day in the great hall, and in the centre
was fixed the upright and lank figure of its
master, with his companion in leanness,
honest
Peter Johnson, on his right.
I have made out, Sir Edward and my
Lady
Moseley, to get as far as my entrance to
receive the favour you are conferring upon me.
It was a rule in my day, and one invariably
practised by all the great nobility, such as
Lord Gosford---and---and---his sister, the
lady
Juliana Dayton, always to receive and
quit their guests in the country at the great
entrance; and in conformity---ah, Emmy
dear, cried the old gentleman, folding her in
his arms as the tears rolled down his cheek,
and forgetting his speech in the warmth of his
feeling, you are saved to us again; God be
praised---there, that will do, let me
breathe---let
me breathe---and then by the way of
getting rid of his softer feelings, he turned
upon John; so, youngster, you would be
playing with edge tools, and put the life of
your sister in danger. No gentlemen held a
gun in my day; that is, no gentlemen about
the court. My Lord Gosford had never killed
a bird in his life, or drove his horse; no sir,
gentlemen then were not coachmen. Peter,
how old was I before I took the reins of the
chaise, in driving round the estate---the time
you had broke your arm; it was
Peter, who stood a little behind his master,
in modest retirement, and who had only
thought his elegant form brought thither to
embellish the show, when called upon,
advanced
a step, made a low bow, and answered in
his sharp key:
In the year 1798, your honour, and the
38th of his present majesty, and the 64th
year of your life, sir, June the 12th, about
meridian
.
Peter had dropped back as he
finished
;
but recollecting himself, regained his
place with a bow, as he added, new style.
How are you, old style? cried John,
with a slap on the back, that made the
steward
jump again.
Mr. John Moseley---young gentleman
---a
term Peter had left off using to the baronet
within the last ten years, did you
think---to
bring home---the goggles?
Oh yes, said John gravely, and he
produced
them from his pocket, most of the
party
having entered the parlour, and put them
carefully on the bald head of the steward---
There Mr. Peter Johnson, you have your
property again. safe and sound.
And Mr. Denbigh said he felt much
indebted
to your consideration in sending
them, said Emily soothingly, as she took
them off with her beautiful hands.
Ah Miss Emmy, said the steward with
one of his best bows, that was---a noble
act; God bless him; and then holding up
his finger significantly, but the fourteenth
codicil---to master's will, and Peter laid his
finger alongside his nose, as he nodded his
head in silence,
I hope the thirteenth contains the name
of honest Peter Johnson, said the young
lady, who felt herself uncommonly well
pleased with the steward's conversation just
then.
As witness, Miss Emmy---witness to
all---but
God forbid, said the steward with
solemnity
,
I should ever live to see the
proving
of them; no, Miss Emmy, master has
done for me what he intended, while I had
youth to enjoy it. I am rich, Miss
Emmy---good
three hundred a year. Emily, who
had seldom heard as long a speech as the old
man's gratitude drew from him, expressed her
pleasure to hear it, and shaking him kindly
by the hand, left him for the parlour.
Niece, said Mr. Benfield, having
scanned
the party closely with his eyes, where
is Colonel Denbigh?
Colonel Egerton, you mean, sir,
interrupted
Lady Moseley.
No, my Lady Moseley, replied her uncle
with great formality, I mean Colonel
Denbigh
.
I take it he is a colonel by this time,
looking expressively at the baronet; and
who is fitter to be a colonel or a general, than
a man who is not afraid of gunpowder.
Colonels must have been scarce in your
youth, sir, cried John, who had rather a
mischievous
propensity to start the old man on
his hobby.
No, jackanapes, gentlemen killed one
another then, although they did not torment
the innocent birds: honour was as dear to a
gentleman of George the second's court, as
to those of his grandson's, and honesty too,
sirrahay, honesty. I remember when we
were in, there was not a man of doubtful in,
tegrity in the ministry, or on our side even;
and then again, when we went out, the
opposition
benches were filled with sterling
characters, making a parliament that was
correct
throughout; can you show me such a
thing at this day?
VOL. I. 21
CHAPTER XXII.
A few
days after the arrival of the
Moseleys
at the lodge, John drove his sisters to the
little village of L, which at that time was
thronged with an unusual number of visiters.
It had among other of its fashionable
arrangements
for the accommodation of its guests,
one of those circulaters of good and evil, a
public library. Books are, in a great
measure
,
the instruments of controlling the
opinions
of a nation like ours. They are an
engine
,
alike powerful to save as to destroy.
It cannot be denied, that our libraries contain
as many volumes of the latter, as the former
description; for we rank amongst the latter,
that long catalogue of idle productions, which,
if they produce no other evil, lead to the
misspending
of time,
our own
perhaps included.
But we cannot refrain expressing our regret,
that such formidable weapons in the cause of
morality, should be suffered to be wielded by
any indifferent or mercenary dealer, who
undoubtedly
will consult rather the public tastes
than their private good; the evil may be
remediless
,
yet we love to express our
sentiments
,
though we should suggest nothing new
or even profitable. Into one of these haunts
of the idle then, John Moseley entered with a
lovely sister leaning on either arm. Books
were the entertainers of Jane, and instructors
of Emily. Sir Edward was fond of reading
of a certain sortthat which required no
great depth of thought, or labour of research;
and like most others who are averse to
contention
,
and disposed to be easily satisfied,
the baronet sometimes found he had
harboured
opinions on things not exactly
reconcilable
with the truth, or even with each
other. It is quite as dangerous to give up
your faculties to the guidance of the author
you are perusing, as it is unprofitable to be
captiously scrutinizing every syllable he may
happen to advance; and Sir Edward was, if
any thing, a little inclined to the dangerous
propensity. Unpleasant, Sir Edward
Moseley
never was. Lady Moseley very seldom
took a book in her hand: her opinions were
established to her own satisfaction on all
important
points, and on the minor ones, she
made it a rule to coincide with the popular
feeling. Jane had a mind more active than
her father, and more brilliant than her
mother
;
and if she had not imbibed injurious
impressions from the unlicensed and
indiscriminate
reading she practised, it was more
owing
to the fortunate circumstance, that the
baronet's library contained nothing extremely
offensive to a pure taste, or dangerous to good
morals, than to any precaution of her
parents
against the deadly, the irretrievable
injury
,
to be sustained from ungoverned liberty
in this respect to a female mind. On the
other hand, Mrs. Wilson had inculcated the
necessity of restraint, in selecting the books
for her perusal, so strenuously on her niece,
that what at first had been the effects of
obedience
and submission, had now settled into
taste and habit; and Emily seldom opened a
book, unless in search of information; or if
it were the indulgence of a less commendable
spirit, it was an indulgence chastened by a
taste and judgment that lessened the danger,
if it did not entirely remove it.
The room was filled with gentlemen and
ladies; and while John was exchanging his
greetings with several of the neighbouring
gentry of his acquaintance, his sisters were
running hastily over a catalogue of the books
kept for circulation, as an elderly lady, of
foreign
accent and dress, entered, and depositing
a couple of religious works on the counter,
inquired for the remainder of the set. The
peculiarity of her idiom, and nearness to the
sisters, caused them both to look up at the
moment, and to the surprise of Jane, her
sister
uttered a slight exclamation of pleasure.
The foreigner was attracted by the sound,
and after a moment's hesitation, respectfully
curtsied. Emily advancing, kindly offered
her hand, and the usual inquiries after each
other's welfare succeeded. To the questions
asked after the friend of the matron, Emily
learnt with some surprise, and no less
satisfaction
,
that she resided in a retired cottage,
about five miles from L, where they had
been for the last six months, and where they
expected to remain for some time, until she
could prevail on Mrs. Fitzgerald to return to
Spain, a thing, now there was peace, she did
not despair of. After asking leave to call
on them in their retreat, and exchanging good
wishes, the Spanish lady withdrew; and as
Jane had made her selection, was followed
immediately by John Moseley and his sisters.
Emily, in their walk home, acquainted her
brother, that the companion of their Bath
incognita
had been at the library, and that for
the first time she had learnt their young
acquaintance
was, or had been, married, and her
name. John listened to his sister with the
interest
which the beautiful Spaniard had
excited
at the time they first met; and
laughingly
told her, he could not believe their
unknow
friend had ever been a wife; to satisfy
this doubt, and to gratify a wish they both
had to renew their acquaintance with the
foreigner
,
they agreed to drive to the cottage
the following morning, accompanied by Mrs.
Wilson, and Jane, if she would go; but the
next day was the one appointed by Egerton
for his arrival at L, and Jane, under a
pretence of writing letters, declined the ride.
She had carefully examined the papers since
his departure; had seen his name included
in the arrivals at London, and at a later day
had read an account of the review by the
commander in chief of the regiment to which
he belonged. He had never written to any
of her friends of his movements, but judging
21*
from her own feelings, she did not in the least
doubt he would be as punctual as love could
make him. Mrs. Wilson listened to her niece's
account of the unexpected interview in the
library
with pleasure, and cheerfully promised
to accompany them in their morning's
excursion
,
as she had both a wish to alleviate
sorrow
,
and a desire to better understand the
character of this accidental acquaintance of
Emily's.
Mr. Benfield and the baronet had a long
conversation in relation to Denbigh's fortune
the morning after their arrival; and the old
man was loud in his expression of
dissatisfaction
at the youngster's pride. As the
baronet
,
however, in the fulness of his affection
and simplicity, betrayed to his uncle his
expectation
of an union between Denbigh and
his daughter, Mr. Benfield became
contented
with this reward; one fit, he thought, for
any services;on the whole, it was best, as
he was to marry Emmy, he should sell out of
the army, and as there would be an election
soon, he would bring him into parliament
yesyesit did a man so much good to sit
one term in the parliament of this realmto
study human nature; all his own knowledge
in that way, was raised on the foundations
laid in the house. To this, Sir Edward
cordially
assented, and the old gentleman
separated
,
happy in their arrangements to advance
the welfare of two beings they so sincerely
loved.
Although the care and wisdom of Mrs.
Wilson had prohibited the admission of any
romantic or enthusiastic expectations of
happiness
into the day-dreams of her charge;
yet the buoyancy of health, of hope, of youth,
of innocence, had elevated Emily to a height
of enjoyment, hitherto unknown to her
usually
placid and disciplined pleasures.
Denbigh
certainly mingled in most of her thoughts,
both of the past and the future, and she had
strode on the threshold of that fantastic
edifice
,
in which Jane ordinarily resided. Emily
was in that situation, perhaps the most
dangerous
to a young female christian: her
heart, her affections, were given to a man, to
appearance, every way worthy of possessing
them, it is true; but she had admitted a
rival
in her love to her Maker; and to keep
those feelings distinct, to bend the passions in
due submission to the more powerful
considerations
of endless duty, of unbounded
gratitude
,
is one of the most trying struggles of
christian fortitude. We are much more apt
to forget our God in prosperity, than
adversity
;the
weakness of human nature drives us
to such assistance in distress, but vanity and
worldly mindedness, often induce us to
imagine
we control the happiness we only
enjoy
.
Sir Edward and Lady Moseley could see
nothing in the prospect of the future but lives
of peace and contentment for their children.
Clara was happily settled, and her sisters
were on the eve of making connexions with
men of family, condition and certain
character
;
what more could be done for them? they
must, like other people, take their chances in
the lottery of life; they could only hope and
pray for their prosperity, and this they did
with great sincerity. Not so Mrs. Wilson; she
had guarded the invaluable charge entrusted
to her keeping with too much assiduity, too
keen an interest, too just a sense of the awful
responsibility she had undertaken, to desert
her post at the moment her watchfulness was
most required. By a temperate, but firm and
well-chosen conversation, she kept alive the
sense of her real condition in her niece, and
laboured hard to prevent the blandishments of
life, supplanting the lively hope of enjoying
another existence; she endeavoured, by her
pious example, her prayers, and her judicious
allusions, to keep the passion of love in the
breast of Emily, secondary to the more
important
object of her creation, and by the aid
of kind and Almighty Providence, her
labours
,
though arduous, were crowned with
success.
As the family were seated round the table
after dinner, on the day of their walk to the
library, John Moseley, awaking from a
reverie
,
exclaimed suddenly to his sister
Which do you think the handsomest,
Emily, Grace Chatterton or Mrs.
Fitzgerald
?
Emily laughed aloud as she answered,
Grace, certainly; do you not think so,
brother
?
Why, sometimes; don't you think Grace
looks like her mother at times?
Oh no, she is the image of Chatterton.
She is very like yourself, Emmy dear,
said Mr. Benfield, who was listening to their
conversation.
Me, dear uncle; I have never heard it
remarked
before.
Yes, yes, she is as much like you as she
can stare; I never saw as great a
resemblance
excepting between you and Lady
Juliana
Lady
Juliana, Emmy, was a beauty
in her day; very like her uncle, old Admiral
Griffinyou can't remember the admiral
he lost an eye in a battle with the Dutch, and
part of his cheek in a frigate when a young
man fighting the Dons. Oh, he was a
pleasant
old gentleman; many a guinea has he
given me when I was a boy at school.
And he looked like Grace Chatterton,
uncle
,
did he? cried John with a smile.
No, sir, he did not; who said he looked
like Grace Chatterton, jackanapes?
Why, I thought you made it out, sir; but
perhaps it was the description that deceived
mehis eye and cheek, uncle.
Did Lord Gosford leave children,
uncle
?
inquired Emily, and throwing a look
of reproach at John.
No, Emmy dear; his only child, a son,
died at school; I shall never forget the grief
of poor Lady Juliana. She postponed a visit
to Bath three weeks on account of it. A
gentleman who was paying his addresses to
her at the time, offered then, and was refused
indeed, her self-denial raised such an
admiration
of her in the men, that immediately
after the death of young Lord Dayton, no
less than seven gentlemen offered and were
refused in one week. I heard Lady Juliana
say, that what between lawyers and suitors,
she had not a moment's peace,
Lawyers! cried Sir Edward, what
had she to do with lawyers?
Why, Sir Edward, six thousand a year
fell to her by the death of her nephew; and
there were trustees and deeds to be made out
poor young woman, she was so affected,
Emmy, I don't think she went out for a week
all the time at home reading papers, and
attending to her important concerns. Oh!
she was a woman of taste; her mourning, and
liveries, and new carriage, were more
admired
than those of any one about the court. Yes,
yes, the title is extinct; I know of none of the
name now. The Earl did not survive his
loss but six years, and the countess died
broken-hearted
,
about a twelvemonth before
him.
And Lady Juliana, uncle, inquired
John, what became of her, did she
marry
?
The old man helped himself to a glass of
wine, and looked over his shoulder to see if
Peter was at hand. Peter, who had been
originally butler, had made it a condition of
his preferment, that whenever there was
company
,
he should be allowed to preside at the
sideboard, was now at his station. Mr.
Benfield
seeing his old friend near him, ventured
to talk on a subject he seldom trusted
himself
with in company.
Why, yesyesshe did marry, it's true,
although she did tell me she intended to
die a maid; but---hem---I suppose---hem---it
was compassion for the old viscount, who
often said he could not live without her; and
then it gave her the power of doing so much
good, a jointure of five thousand a year
added
to her own income: yet---hem---I do
confess I did not think she would have
chosen
such an old and infirm
man---but---Peter
give me a glass of claret. Peter handed
the claret, and the old man proceeded.
They say he was very cross to her, and
that, no doubt, must have made her
unhappy
,
she was so very tender-hearted.
How much longer the old gentleman would
have continued in this strain, it is impossible
to say; but he was interrupted by the
opening
of the parlour door, and the sudden
appearance
on its threshold of Denbigh.
Every
countenance glowed with pleasure at this
unexpected return to them of their favourite;
and but for the prudent caution in Mrs.
Wilson
,
of handing a glass of water to her niece,
the surprise might have proved too much for
her. His salutations were returned by the
different members of the family, with a
cordiality
that must have told him how much he
was valued by all its branches; and after
briefly informing them that his review was
over, and that he had thrown himself into a
chaise and travelled post until he had
rejoined
them, he took his seat by Mr. Benfield,
who received him with a marked preference,
exceeding what he had shown to any man
who had ever entered his doors, Lord
Gosford
himself not excepted. Peter removed
from his station behind his master's chair to
one where he could face the new comer; and
after wiping his eyes until they filled so
rapidly
with water, that at last he was noticed
by the delighted John to put on the identical
goggles which his care had provided for
Denbigh
in his illness. His laugh drew the
attention
of the rest to the honest steward, and
when Denbigh was told this was Mr.
Benfield's
ambassador to the Hall on his account,
he rose from his chair, and taking the old
man by the hand, kindly thanked him for his
thoughtful consideration for his weak eyes.
Peter took the offered hand in both his
own, and after making one or two
unsuccessful
efforts to speak, he uttered, thank
you, thank you, may Heaven bless you, and
burst into tears. This stopt the laugh, and
John followed the steward from the room,
while his master exclaimed, wiping his eyes,
kind and condescending; just such another
as my old friend, the Earl of Gosford.
CHAPTER XXIII.
At
the appointed hour, the carriage of
Mrs. Wilson was ready to convey herself
and niece to the cottage of Mrs. Fitzgerald.
John was left behind, under the pretence of
keeping Denbigh company in his morning
avocations, but really because Mrs. Wilson
doubted the propriety of his becoming a
visiting
acquaintance at a house, tenanted as the
cottage was represented to be. John was too
fond of his friend to make any serious
objections
,
and was satisfied for the present, by
sending his compliments, and requesting his
sister to ask permission for him to call in one
of his early morning excursions, in order to
pay his personal respects.
They found the cottage a beautiful and
genteel, though very small and retired
dwelling
,
almost hid by the trees and shrubs
which surrounded it, and its mistress on its
little piazza, expecting the arrival of Emily.
Mrs. Fitzgerald was a Spaniard under
twenty
,
of a melancholy, yet highly interesting
countenance; her manners were soft and
retiring
,
but evidently bore the impression of
good company, if not of high life. She was
extremely pleased with this renewal of
attention
on the part of Emily, and expressed her
gratitude to both ladies for this kindness in
seeking her out in her solitude. She
presented
VOL. 1. 22
her more matronly companion to them, by
the name of Donna Lorenza; and as nothing
but good feelings prevailed, and useless
ceremony
was banished, the little party were soon
on terms of friendly intercourse. The young
widow (for such her dress indicated her to
be) did the honours of her house with
graceful
ease, and conducted her visiters into her
little grounds, which, together with the
cottage
,
gave evident proofs of the taste and
elegance
of its occupant. The establishment
she supported she represented as very small;
two women and an aged man servant, with
occasionally a labourer for her garden and
shrubbery. They never visited; it was a
resolution she had made on fixing her
residence
,
but if Mrs. Wilson and Miss Moseley
would forgive her rudeness in not returning
their call, nothing would give her more
satisfaction
than a frequent renewal of their
visits. Mrs. Wilson took so deep an
interest
in the misfortunes of so young a female,
and was so much pleased with the modest
resignation of her manner, that it required
little persuasion on the part of the recluse
to obtain a promise of repeating her visit
soon. Emily mentioned the request of John,
and Mrs. Fitzgerald received it with a
mournful
smile, as she replied that Mr. Moseley
had laid her under such an obligation in
their first interview, she could not deny
herself the pleasure of again thanking him
for it; but she must be excused if she
desired
they would limit their attendants to
him, as there was but one gentleman in
England
whose visits she admitted, and it was
seldom indeed he called; he had seen her
but once since she had resided in Norfolk.
After giving a promise not to suffer any
one else to accompany them, and promising
an early call again, our ladies returned to
Benfield Lodge in season to dress for dinner.
On entering the drawing-room, they found
the elegant person of Colonel Egerton
leaning
on the back of the chair of Jane. He
had arrived during their absence, and sought
out immediately the baronet's family; his
reception, if not as warm as that given to
Denbigh, was cordial from all but the master
of the house; and even he was in such
spirits by the company around him, and the
prospects of Emily's marriage, (which he
considered as settled,) that he forced himself
to an appearance of good will he did not feel.
Colonel Egerton was either deceived by his
manner, or too much a man of the world to
discover his suspicion, and every thing in
consequence was very harmoniously, if not
sincerely, conducted between them.
Lady Moseley was completely happy: if
she had the least doubts before, as to the
intentions
of Egerton, they were now removed.
His journey to that unfashionable
watering-place
,
was owing to his passion; and
however
she might at times have doubted as to Sir
Edgar's heir, Denbigh she thought a man
of too little consequence in the world, to
make it possible he would neglect to profit by
his situation in the family of Sir Edward
Moseley. She was satisfied with both
connexions
.
Mr. Benfield had told her, General
Sir Frederic Denbigh was nearly allied to
the Duke of Derwent, and Denbigh had said
the general was his grandfather. Wealth,
she knew Emily would possess from both
her uncle and aunt; and the services of the
gentleman had their due weight upon the
feelings of the affectionate mother. The
greatest care of her maternal anxiety was
removed
,
and she looked forward to the
peaceful
enjoyment of the remnant of her days in
the bosom of her descendants. John, the
heir to a baronetcy, and 15,000 pounds a
year, might suit himself; and Grace
Chatterton
she thought would be likely to prove the
future Lady Moseley. Sir Edward, without
entering so deeply into anticipation of the
future as his lady, experienced an equal
degree
of contentment; and it would have been
a difficult task to have discovered in the
island a roof, under which there resided at
the moment more happy countenances than
at Benfield Lodge; for as its master had
insisted
on Denbigh's becoming an inmate, he
was obliged to extend his hospitality in an
equal degree to Colonel Egerton: indeed,
the subject had been fully canvassed between
him and Peter the morning of his arrival, and
was near being decided against his admission,
when the steward, who had picked up all the
incidents of the arbour scene from the
servants
,
(and of course with many
exaggerations
,)
mentioned to his master that the
colonel
was very active in his assistance, and
that he even contrived to bring water to
revive
Miss Emmy a great distance in the hat
of Captain Jarvis, which was full of holes,
Mr. John having blown it off the head of the
captain without hurting a hair, in firing at a
woodcock. This molified the master a little,
and he agreed to suspend his decision for
further
observation. At dinner, the colonel
happening
to admire the really handsome face of
Lord Gosford, as delineated by Sir Joshua
Reynolds, and which graced the dining room
of Benfield Lodge, its master, in a moment of
unusual kindness, gave the invitation; it was
politely accepted, and the colonel at once
domesticated
.
The face of John Moseley alone, at times,
exhibited evidences of care and thought, and
at such moments, it might be a subject of
doubt, whether he thought the most of Grace
Chatterton or her mother: if the latter, the
former was sure to lose ground in his
estimation
,
a serious misfortune to John, not to be
able to love Grace without alloy. His
letters
from her brother, mentioned his being
still at Denbigh castle, in Westmoreland, the
seat of his friend the Duke of Derwent; and
John thought one or two of his encomiums
on Lady Harriet Denbigh, the sister of his
22*
grace, augured that the unkindness of Emily
might in time be forgotten. The dowager
and her daughters were at the seat of a
maiden
aunt in Yorkshire, where, as John knew
no male animal was allowed admittance, he
was tolerably easy at the disposition of things.
Nothing but legacy-hunting, he knew, would
induce the dowager to submit to such a
banishment
from the other sex; but that was
so preferable to husband-hunting, he was
satisfied
.
I wish, said John mentally, as
he finished the perusal of his letter, mother
Chatterton would get married herself, and
she might let Kate and Grace manage for
themselves: Kate would do very well, I dare
say, and how would Grace make out. John
sighed, and whistled for Dido and Rover.
In the manners of Colonel Egerton there
was the same general disposition to please,
and the same unremitted attention to the
wishes and amusements of Jane; they had
renewed their poetical investigations, and
Jane eagerly encouraged a taste which
afforded
her delicacy some little colouring for the
indulgence of an association different from the
real truth, and which in her estimation was
necessary to her happiness. Mrs. Wilson
thought the distance between the two suitors
for the favour of her nieces, was if any thing
increased by their short separation, and
particularly
noticed on the part of the colonel an
aversion to Denbigh that at times painfully
alarmed her, by exciting apprehensions for
the future happiness of the precious treasure
she had prepared herself to yield to his
solicitations
,
whenever properly proffered. In the
intercourse between Emily and her preserver,
as there was nothing to condemn, so there
was much to admire. The attentions of
Denbigh were pointed, although less
exclusive
than those of the colonel; and the aunt
was pleased to observe, that if the manners
of Egerton had more of the gloss of life,
those of Denbigh were certainly
distinguished
by a more finished delicacy and propriety:
the one appeared the influence of custom and
association, with a tincture of artifice; the
other, benevolence, with a just perception of
what was due to others, and with an air of
sincerity when speaking of sentiments and
principles, that was particularly pleasing to
the watchful widow: at times, however, she
could not but observe an air of restraint, if
not of awkwardness, about him, that was a
little surprising. It was most observable in
mixed society, and once or twice her
imagination
pictured his sensations into something
like alarm. These unpleasant interruptions
to her admiration of the manners and
appearance
of Denbigh, were soon forgotten in her
just appreciation of the more solid parts of his
characterthese appeared literally
unexceptionable
;
and when momentary uneasiness
would steal over her, the remembrance of the
opinion of Dr. Ives, his behaviour with
Jarvis
,
his charity, and chiefly his self-devotion
to her niece, would not fail to drive the
disagreeable
thoughts from her mind. Emily
herself moved about, the image of joy and
innocence
if
Denbigh was near her, she was
happy; if absent, she suffered no uneasiness;
her feelings were so ardent, and yet so pure,
that jealousy had no admission: perhaps no
circumstances existed to excite this
never-failing
attendant of the passion; but as the
heart of Emily was more enchained than her
imagination, her affections were not of the
restless nature of ordinary attachments, though
more dangerous to her peace of mind in the
event of an unfortunate issue. With
Denbigh
she never walked or rode alone. He
had never made the request, and her delicacy
would have shrunk from such an open
manifestation
of her preference; but he read to
her and her aunt; he accompanied them in
their little excursions; and once or twice
John noticed that she took the offered hand
of Denbigh to assist her over any little
impediment
in their course, instead of her usual
unobtrusive custom of taking his arm on such
occasions. Well, Miss Emily, thought
John, you appear to have chosen another
favourite, on her doing this three times in
succession in one of their walks; how strange
it is, women will quit their natural friends for
a face they have hardly seen. John forgot
his ownthere is no danger, dear Grace,
when his sister was almost dead with
apprehension
.
But John loved Emily too well to
witness her preference to another with
satisfaction
,
even though Denbigh was the
favourite
,
a feeling which soon wore away by
custom and reflection. Mr. Benfield had
taken it into his head, that if the wedding of
Emily could be solemnised while the family
was at the lodge, it would render him the
happiest of men, and how to compass this
object, was the occupation of a whole
morning's
contemplation. Happily for Emily's
blushes, the old gentleman harboured the most
fastidious notions of female delicacy, and
never in conversation made the most distant
allusion to the expected connexion. He,
therefore, in conformity with these feelings,
could do nothing openly; all would be the
effect of management, and as he thought
Peter
one of the best contrivers in the world, to
his ingenuity he determined to refer the
arrangement
.
The bell rangsend Johnson
to me, David; in a few minutes the drab
coat and blue yarn stockings entered his
dressing room with the body of Mr. Peter
Johnson snugly cased within them. Peter,
commenced Mr. Benfield, pointing kindly to
a chair, which the steward respectfully
declined
,
I suppose you know that Mr.
Denbigh
,
the grandson of General Denbigh, who
was in parliament with me, is about to marry
my little Emmy. Peter smiled as he bowed
his assent. Now, Peter, a wedding would
of all things make me most happy; that is,
to have it here in the lodge: it would remind
me so much of the marriage of Lord Gosford,
and the bridemaidsI wish your opinion
how to bring it about before they leave here:
Sir Edward and Anne decline interfering,
and Mrs. Wilson I am afraid to speak to on
the subject. Peter was not a little alarmed
by this sudden requisition on his inventive
faculties, especially as a lady was in the case;
but as he prided himself on serving his
master
,
and loved the hilarity of a wedding in his
heart, he cogitated for some time in silence,
when having thought a preliminary question
or two necessary, he broke it with saying,
Every thing, I suppose, master, is settled
between the young people?
Every thing, I take it, Peter.
And Sir Edward and my lady?
Willing; perfectly willing.
And Madam Wilson, sir.
Willing, Peter, willing.
And Mr. John and Miss Jane?
All willing; the whole family willing, to
the best of my belief.
There is the Rev. Mr. Ives and Mrs.
Ives, master.
They wish it, I know; don't you think
they wish others as happy as themselves,
Peter
?
No doubt they do, master: well then, as
every body is willing, and the young people
agreeable, the only thing to be done, sir, is--
Is what, Peter? exclaimed his
impatient
master, observing him to hesitate.
Why, sit, to send for the priest, I take
it.
Pshaw! Peter Johnson, I know that
myself
,
replied the dissatisfied old man;
cannot
you help me to a better plan?
Why, master, said Peter, I would have
done as well for Miss Emmy and your
honour
,
as I would have done for myself: now.
sir, when I courted Patty Steele, your
honour
,
in the year of our Lord one thousand
seven hundred and sixty-five, I should have
been married but for one difficulty, which
your honour says is removed in the case of
Miss Emmy.
What was that, Peter, asked his master
in a tender tone.
She was'nt willing, sir.
Very well, poor Peter, replied Mr.
Benfield mildly, you may go; and the
steward
,
bowing low, withdrew. The similarity
of their fortunes in love, was a strong link in
the sympathies which bound the master and
man together, and the former never failed to
be softened by an allusion to Patty; his want
of tact, on the present occasion, after much
reflection, he attributed to his never sitting
in parliament.
CHAPTER XXIV.
Mrs. Wilson and Emily, in the fortnight
they had been at Benfield Lodge, had paid
frequent and long visits to the cottage; and
each succeeding interview left a more
favourable
impression of the character of its
mistress, and a greater certainty that she was
unfortunate; she, however, alluded very
slightly
to her situation or former life; she was a
protestant, to the great surprise of Mrs.
Wilson; and one that misery had made
nearly acquainted with the religion she
professed
.
Their conversations chiefly turned
on the customs of her own, as contrasted
with those of her adopted country, or in a
pleasant exchange of opinions, which the
ladies possessed in complete unison. One
morning John had accompanied them and
been admitted; Mrs. Fitzgerald received him
with the frankness of an old acquaintance,
though with the reserve of a Spanish lady.
His visits were permitted under the direction
of his aunt, but no other of the
gentlemen
were included amongst her guests.
Mrs. Wilson had casually mentioned, in the
absence of her niece, the interposition of
Denbigh between her and death; and Mrs.
Fitzgerald was pleased at the noble conduct
of the gentleman so much as to express a
desire
to see him; but the impressions of the
moment appeared to have died away, as
nothing more was said by either lady on the
subject, and was apparently forgotten. Mrs.
Fitzgerald was found one morning, weeping
over a letter she held in her hand, and the
Donna Lorenza endeavouring to console her.
The situation of this latter lady was
somewhat
doubtful; she appeared neither wholly
a friend or a menial; in the manners of the
two there was a striking difference; although
the Donna was not vulgar, she was far from
the polish of her more juvenile friend, and
Mrs. Wilson considered her in a station
between
a housekeeper and a companion.
After
hoping that no unpleasant intelligence
occasioned the distress they witnessed, the
ladies were about delicately to take their
leave, but Mrs. Fitzgerald intreated them to
remain.
Your kind attention to me, dear madam,
and the goodness of Miss Moseley, give you
a claim to know more of the unfortunate
being your sympathy has greatly assisted to
attain her peace of mind; this letter is from
the gentleman you have heard me speak of,
as once visiting me, and though it has struck
me with an unusual force, it contains no more
than I expected to hear, perhaps no more
than I deserve to hear.
I hope your friend has not been
unnecessarily
harsh; severity is not the best way,
always
,
of effecting repentance, and I feel
certain
that you, my young friend, can have been
VOL. I. 23
guilty of no offence that does not rather
require
gentle than stern reproof, said Mrs.
Wilson.
I thank you, dear madam, for your
indulgent
opinion of me, but although I have
suffered much, I am free to confess, it is a
merited punishment; you are, however,
mistaken
as to the source of my present sorrow;
Lord Pendennyss is the cause of grief, I
believe
,
to no one, much less to me.
Lord Pendennyss! exclaimed Emily,
in surprise, unconsciously looking at her aunt.
Pendennyss! reiterated Mrs. Wilson,
with animation, and is he your friend
too?
Yes, madam; to his lordship I owe every
thinghonourcomfortreligionand even
life itself.
Mrs. Wilson's cheek glowed with an
unusual
colour, at this discovery of another act
of benevolence and virtue, in the young
nobleman
whose character she had so long
admired, and whose person she had in vain
wished to meet.
You know the earl then, inquired Mrs.
Fitzgerald.
By reputation, only, my dear, said Mrs.
Wilson; but that is enough to convince me
a friend of his must be a worthy character,
if any thing were wanting to make us your
friends.
The conversation was continued for some
time, and Mrs. Fitzgerald saying she did not
feel equal just then to the undertaking, would
the next day, if they would honour her with
another call, make them acquainted with the
incidents of her life, and the reasons she had
for speaking in such terms of Lord
Pendennyss
.
The promise to see her then, was
cheerfully
made by Mrs. Wilson, and her
confidence
accepted; not from a desire to gratify
an idle curiosity, but a belief that it was
necessary
to probe a wound to cure it; and a correct
opinion, that herself would be a better
adviser
for a young and lovely woman, than
even Pendennyss; for the Donna Lorenza
she could hardly consider in a capacity to
offer her advice, much less dictation. They
then took their leave, and Emily, during their
ride, broke the silence with exclaiming,
Wherever we hear of Lord Pendennyss,
aunt, we hear of him favourably.
A certain sign, my dear, he is deserving
of it; there is hardly any man who has not
his enemies, and those are seldom just; but
we have met with none of the earl's yet.
Fifty thousand a year will make many
friends, observed Emily, with a smile.
Doubtless, my love, or as many
enemies
;
but honour, life, and religion, my
child, are debts not owing to money, in this
country, at least.
To this remark Emily assented, and after
expressing her own admiration of the
character
of the young nobleman, dropped into
a reverie;how many of his virtues she
identified with the person of Mr. Denbigh,
it is not, just now, our task to enumerate;
but judges of human nature may easily
determine
and
that without having sat in the
parliament of this realm.
The same morning this conversation
occurred
at the cottage, Mr. and Mrs. Jarvis,
with their daughters, made their unexpected
appearance at L. The arrival of a
post-chaise
and four, with a gig, was an event
soon circulated through the little village, and
the names of its owners reached the lodge
just as Jane had allowed herself to be
persuaded
by the colonel to take her first walk
with him unaccompanied by a third person
walking is much more propitious to
declarations
than riding; whether it was
premeditated
on the part of the colonel or not, or
whether he was afraid that Mrs. Jarvis, or
some one else, would interfere, he availed
himself of his opportunity, and had hardly
got out of hearing of her brother and
Denbigh
,
before he made Jane an explicit offer
of his hand; the surprise was so great, that
some time elapsed before the distressed girl
could reply; this she, however, at length did,
but incoherently; she referred him to her
parents
,
as arbiters of her fate, well knowing
that her wishes had long been those of her
father and mother; with this the colonel was
obliged to be satisfied for the present. But
their walk had not ended, before he gradually
drew from the confiding girl, an
acknowledgment
that should her parents decline his
offer, she would be very little less miserable
than himself; indeed, the most tenacious
lover might have been content with the
proofs of regard that Jane, unused to control
her feelings, allowed herself to manifest on
this occasion. Egerton was in raptures; a
life devoted to her, would never half repay
her condescension; and as their confidence
increased with their walk, Jane re-entered
the lodge with a degree of happiness in her
heart, she had never before experienced; the
much dreaded declarationher own
distressing
acknowledgments, were made, and
nothing further remained but to liveto be
happy. She flew into the arms of her
mother, and hiding her blushes in her bosom,
acquainted her with the colonel's offer and
her own wishes. Lady Moseley, who was
prepared for such a communication, and had
rather wondered at its tardiness, kissed her
daughter affectionately, as she promised to
speak to her father for his approbation.
But, she added, with a degree of
formality
and caution, which had better
preceded
than have followed the courtship, we
must make the usual inquiries, my child, into
the fitness of Colonel Egerton, as a husband
for our daughter; and once assured of that,
you have nothing to fear.
The Baronet was requested to grant an
audience to Colonel Egerton, who now
appeared
as determined to expedite things, as
he had been dilatory before. On meeting
23*
Sir Edward, he made known his pretensions
and hopes. The father, who had been
previously
notified by his wife, of what was
forthcoming, gave a general answer, similar
to her speech to their daughter, and the
colonel
bowed in acquiescence.
In the evening, the Jarvis family favoured
the inhabitants of the lodge with a visit, and
Mrs. Wilson was struck with the singularity
of their reception of the colonelMiss
Jarvis
,
especially, was rude to both him and
Jane, and it struck all who witnessed it, as
a burst of jealous feeling for disappointed
hopes; but to no one, excepting Mrs. Wilson,
did it occur, that the conduct of the
gentleman
could be at all implicated in the
transaction
.
Mr. Benfield was happy to see again
under his roof, the best of the trio of Jarvises
he had known, and something like sociability
prevailed in the party. There was to be a
ball, Miss Jarvis remarked, at L, on the
following day, which would help to enliven
the scene a little, especially as there were a
couple of frigates lying at anchor, a few
miles off, and the officers were expected to
join the party; this intelligence had but little
effect on the ladies of the Moseley family,
yet as their uncle desired that, if invited,
they would go, out of respect to his
neighbours
,
they cheerfully assented. During the
evening, Mrs. Wilson observed Egerton in
familiar conversation with Miss Jarvis, and
as she had been been notified of his situation
with respect to Jane, she determined to watch
narrowly into the causes of so singular a
change of deportment in the young lady.
Mrs. Jarvis retained her respect for the
colonel
in full force, and called out to him
across the room a few minutes before she
departed
Well, colonel, I am happy to tell you
I have heard very lately from your uncle, Sir
Edgar.
Indeed, madam, replied the colonel,
starting, he was well, I hope.
Very well, the day before yesterday; his
neighbour, old Mr. Holt, is a lodger in the
same house with us at L, and as I
thought you would like to hear, I made
particular
inquiries about the baronetthe
word baronet was pronounced with emphasis,
and a look of triumph, as if it would say,
you see
we
have baronets as well as you; as
no answer was made by Egerton, excepting
an acknowledging bowthe merchant and
his family departed.
Well, John, cried Emily, with a smile,
we have heard more good, to day, of our
trusty and well-beloved cousin, the Earl of
Pendennyss.
Indeed, exclaimed her brother; you
must keep Emily for his lordship, positively,
aunt, she is almost as great an admirer of him
as yourself.
I apprehend it is necessary she should be
quite as much so, to become his wife, said
Mrs. Wilson.
Really, said Emily, more gravely, if
all one hears of him be true, or half even,
it would be no difficult task to admire him.
Denbigh was standing leaning on the
back of a chair, in a situation where he
could view the animated countenance of
Emily as she spoke, and Mrs. Wilson noticed
an uneasiness and changing of colour in him,
that appeared uncommon from so trifling an
excitement. Is it possible, she thought,
Denbigh
can harbour so mean a passion as envy;
he walked away, as if unwilling to hear
more, and appeared much engrossed with his
own reflections for the remainder of the
evening; there were moments of doubting,
which crossed the mind of Mrs. Wilson,
with a keenness of apprehension
proportionate
to her deep interest in Emily, with
respect
to certain traits in the character of
Denbigh; and this, what she thought a
display of unworthy feeling, was one of
them. In the course of the evening, the
cards for the expected ball arrived and were
accepted; as this new arrangement for the
morrow interfered with their intended vist to
Mrs. Fitzgerald, a servant was sent with a
note of explanation in the morning, and a
request that on the following day the
promised
communication would be made; to
this the recluse assented; and Emily
prepared for the ball with a recollection of
melancholy pleasure, of the consequences
which grew out of the last one she attended;
melancholy at the fate of Digby, and
pleasure
at the principles manifested by Denbigh
on the occasion. The latter, however, with
a smile, excused himself from the party,
telling Emily he was so awkward, that he
feared some unpleasant consequences to
himself
or his friends would arise from his
inadvertencies
,
did he venture again with her
into such an assembly.
Emily sighed gently, as she entered the
carriage of her aunt early in the afternoon,
leaving Denbigh in the door of the lodge,
and Egerton absent on the execution of some
business; the former to amuse himself as
he would until the following morning, and
the latter to join them in the dance in the
evening.
The arrangement included an excursion
on the water, attended by the bands from the
frigates, a collation, and in the evening a
ball. One of the vessels was commanded
by a Lord Henry Stapleton, a fine young
man, who, struck with the beauty and
appearance
of the sisters, sought an
introduction
with the baronet's family, and engaged
the hand of Emily for the first dance. His
frank and gentlemanlike deportment was
pleasing to his new acquaintances; the more
so, as it was peculiarly suited to their
situation
at the moment. Mrs. Wilson was in
unusual spirits, and maintained an animated
conversation with the noble sailor, in the
course of which, he spoke of his cruising on
the coast of Spain, and by accident
mentioned
his having carried out to that country,
upon one occasion, Lord Pendennyss; this
was common ground between them, and Lord
Henry was as enthusiastic in his praises of
the earl, as Mrs. Wilson's partiality could
hope for. He also knew Colonel Egerton
slightly, and expressed his pleasure, in polite
terms, when they met in the evening in the
ball-room, at being able to renew his
acquaintance
.
The evening passed off as such
evenings generally doin gayety
listlessness
dancinggaping,
and heart-burnings,
according to the dispositions and good or ill
fortune of the several individuals who
compose
the assembly. Mrs. Wilson, while her
nieces were dancing, moved her seat to be
near a window, and found herself in the
vicinity of two elderly gentleman, who were
commenting on the company; after making
several common-place remarks, one of them
inquired of the otherWho is that
military
gentleman amongst the naval beaux,
Holt?
That is the hopeful nephew of my friend
and neighbour, Sir Edgar Egerton; he is
here dancing and mis-spending his time and
money, when I know Sir Edgar gave him a
thousand pounds six months ago, on express
condition, he should not leave the regiment
or take a card in his hand for a
twelvemonth
.
He plays, then? Sadly; he is,
on the whole, a bad young man. As they
changed their topic, Mrs. Wilson joined her
sister, dreadfully shocked at this intimation
of the vices of a man so near an alliance
with her brother's child; she was thankful
it was not too late to avert part of the evil,
and determined to acquaint Sir Edward, at
once, with what she had heard, in order that
an investigation might establish the colonel's
innocence or guilt.
CHAPTER XXV.
They returned to the lodge at an early
hour, and Mrs. Wilson, after meditating upon
the course she ought to take, resolved to
have a conversation with her brother that
evening after supper; accordingly, as they
were among the last to retire, she mentioned
her wish to detain him, and when left by
themselves, the baronet taking his seat by her
on a sofa, she commenced as follows, willing
to avert her unpleasant information until the
last moment.
I wished to say something to you,
brother
,
relating to my charge, and other matters;
you have, no doubt, observed the attentions of
Mr. Denbigh to Emily?
Certainly, sister, and with great pleasure;
you must not suppose I wish to interfere with
the authority I have so freely relinquished to
you, Charlotte, when I inquire if Emily
favours
his views, or not?
Neither Emily or myself, my dear
brother
,
wish ever to question your right, not
only to inquire into, but control the conduct
of your child;she is yours, Edward, by a
tie nothing can break, and we both love you
too much to wish it. There is nothing you
may be more certain of, than that, without
the approbation of her parents, Emily would
accept of no offer, however splendid or
agreeable
to her own wishes.
Nay, sister, I would not wish unduly
to influence my child in an affair of so much
importance to herself; but my interest in
Denbigh is little short of what I feel for my
daughter.
I trust, continued Mrs. Wilson, Emily
is too deeply impressed with her duty to
forget the impressive mandate, `to honour
her father and mother;' yes, Sir Edward,
I am mistaken if she would not relinquish
the dearest object of her affections, at your
request; and at the same time, I am
persuaded
she would, under no circumstances,
approach the alter with a man she did not
both love and esteem.
The baronet did not appear exactly to
understand
his sister's distinction, as he observed,
I am not sure I rightly comprehend the
difference
you make, Charlotte.
Only, brother, that she would feel, a
promise made at the altar to love a man she
felt averse to, or honour one she could not
esteem, as a breach of a duty, paramount to
all earthly ones, replied his sister; but
to answer your questionDenbigh has never
offered, and when he does, I do not think he
will be refused.
Refused! cried the baronet, I
sincerely
hope not; I wish, with all my heart,
they were married already.
Emily is very young, said Mrs. Wilson,
VOL. I. 24
and need not hurry; I was in hopes she
would remain single a few years longer.
Well, said the baronet, you and Lady
Moseley, sister, have different notions on this
subject of marrying the girls.
Mrs. Wilson replied, with a good-humoured
smile, you have made Anne so good a
husband
,
baronet, she forgets there are any bad
ones in the world;
my
greatest anxiety is,
that the husband of my niece may be a
christian; indeed, I know not how I can
reconcile it to my conscience, as a christian,
myself, to omit this important qualification.
I am sure, Charlotte, both Denbigh and
Egerton appear to have a great respect for
religion; they are punctual at church, and
very attentive to the service; Mrs. Wilson
smiled, as he proceeded, but religion may
come after marriage, you know.
Yes, brother, and I know it may not
come at all; no really pious woman can be
happy, without her husband is in what she
deems the road to future happiness himself;
and it is idleit is worseit is almost impious
to marry with a view to reform a husband;
indeed, she greatly endangers her own safety
thereby, for few of us, I believe, but what
find the temptation to err as much as we can
contend with, without calling in the aid of
example against us, in an object we love;
indeed, it appears to me, the life of such a
woman must be a struggle between
conflicting
duties.
Why, said the baronet, if your plan
were generally adopted, I am afraid it would
give a deadly blow to matrimony.
I have nothing to do with generals,
brother
,
I am acting for individual happiness,
and discharging individual duties; at the same
time I cannot agree with you in its effects on
the community. I think no man who
dispassionately
examines the subject, will be other
than a christian; and rather than remain
bachelors, they would take even that trouble;
if the strife in our sex was less for a
husband
,
wives would increase in value.
But how is it, Charlotte, said the
baronet
pleasantly, your sex do not use your
power and reform the age?
The work of reformation, Sir Edward,
replied his sister, gravely, is an arduous
one indeed, and I despair of seeing it general,
in my day; but much, very much, might be
done towards it, if those who have the
guidance of youth, would take that trouble
with their pupils, that good faith requires of
them, to discharge the lesser duties of life.
Women ought to marry, observed the
baronet, musing.
Marriage is certainly the natural and
most desirable state for a woman, rejoined
his sister; but how few are there who,
having entered it, know how to discharge its
duties; more particularly those of a mother.
On the subject of marrying our daughters, for
instance, instead of qualifying them to make
a proper choice, they are generally left to
pick up such principles and opinions as they
may come at, as it were by chance; it is
true, if the parent be a christian in name,
certain of the externals of religion are
observed
;
but what are these, if not enforced by
a consistent example in the instructor?
Useful precepts are seldom lost, I
believe
,
sister, said Sir Edward, with
confidence
.
Always useful, my dear brother; but
young people are more observant than we are
apt to imagine, and are wonderfully
ingenious
in devising excuses to themselves for their
conduct. I have often heard it offered as an
excuse, that father or mother knew it, or
perhaps did it, and therefore it could not be
wrong; association is all-important to a
child.
I believe no family of consequence
admits
of improper associates, within my
knowledge
,
said the baronet.
Mrs. Wilson smiled as she answered, I am
sure I hope not, Edward; but are the
qualifications
we require in companions for our
daughters, always such as are most
reconcilable
with our good sense or our
consciences
;
a single communication with an
objectionable
character is a precedent, if known
and unobserved, which will be offered to
excuse
acquaintances with worse ones; with
the other sex especially, their acquaintance
should be very guarded and select.
You would make many old maids,
sister
,
cried Sir Edward, with a laugh.
I doubt it greatly, brother; it would
rather
bring female society in demand. I often
regret that selfishness, cupidity, and a kind of
strife, which prevails in our sex, on the road
to matrimony, have brought celibacy into
disrepute; for my part, I never see an old
maid, but I am willing to think she is so from
choice or principle, and although not in her
proper place serviceable, by keeping alive
feelings necessary to exist, that marriages
may not become curses, instead of blessings.
A kind of Eddystone, to prevent
matrimonial
shipwrecks, said the brother gayly.
Their lot may be solitary, baronet, and
in some measure cheerless, but infinitely
preferable
to a marriage that may lead
themselves
astray from their duties, or give birth
to a family, which are to be turned on the
worldwithout any religion but form
without
any morals but truismsor without even
a conscience which has not been seared by
indulgence. I hope that Anne, in the
performance
of her indulgent system, will have
no cause to regret its failure.
Clara chose for herself, and has done
well, Charlotte; and so I doubt not will
Jane and Emily; and I confess I think it is
their right.
It is true, said Mrs. Wilson, Clara
has done well, though under circumstances of
but little risk; she might have jumped into
22*
your fishpond and escaped with life, but the
chances are she would drown; nor do I
dispute
their right to choose for themselves;
but I say their rights extend to their requiring
us to qualify them to make their choice. I
am sorry, Edward, to be the instigator of
doubts in your breast of the worth of any
one, especially as it may give you pain.
Here Mrs. Wilson took her brother
affectionately
by the hand as she communicated what
she had overheard that evening. Although
the impressions of the baronet were not as
vivid or deep as those of his sister, his
parental
love was too great not to make him
extremely uneasy under the intelligence; and
after thanking his sister for her attention to
his children's welfare, he kissed her, and
withdrew; in passing to his own room, he
met Egerton, that moment returned from
escorting the Jarvis ladies to their lodgings;
a task he had undertaken at the request of
Jane, as they were without any male
attendant
.
Sir Edward's heart was too full
not to seek immediate relief, and as he had
strong hopes of the innocence of the colonel,
though he could give no reason for his
expectation
,
he returned with him to the parlour,
and in a few words acquainted him with the
slanders which had been circulated at his
expense
;
begging him by all means to disprove
them as soon as possible. The colonel was
struck with the circumstance at first, but
assured
Sir Edward, it was entirely untruehe
never
played, as he might have noticed, and that
Mr. Holt was an ancient enemy of hishe
would in the morning take measures to
convince
Sir Edward, that he stood higher in the
estimation of his uncle, than Mr. Holt had
thought proper to state. Much relieved by
this explanation, the baronet, forgetting that
this heavy charge removed, he only stood
where he did before he took time for his
inquiries
,
assured him, that if he could
convince
him, or rather his sister, he did not
gamble
,
he would receive him as a son-in-law,
with pleasure. The gentlemen shook hands
and parted.
Denbigh had retired to his room early,
telling
Mr. Benfield he did not feel well, and
thus missed the party at supper; and by
twelve, silence prevailed in the house. As
usual, after a previous day of pleasure, the
party were late in assembling on the
following
,
yet Denbigh was the last who made his
appearance. Mrs. Wilson thought he threw a
look round the room as he entered, which
prevented his making his salutations in his
usual easy and polished manner; in a few
minutes, however, his awkwardness was
removed
,
and they took their seats at the table.
At the moment the door of the room was
thrown hastily open, and Mr. Jarvis entered
abruptly, and with a look bordering on
wildness
in his eyeIs she not here?
exclaimed
the merchant, scanning the
company
closely.
Who? inquired all in a breath.
Pollymy daughtermy child, said
the merchant, endeavouring to control his
feelings; did she not come here this
morning
with Colonel Egerton?
He was answered in the negative, and he
briefly explained the cause of his anxiety
the colonel had called very early, and sent
her maid up to his daughter, who rose
immediately
;
they had left the house, leaving
word the Miss Moseleys had sent for her to
breakfast for a particular reason. Such was
the latitude allowed by his wife, that nothing
was suspected until one of the servants of the
house said he had seen Colonel Egerton and
a lady drive out of the village that morning
in a post-chaise and four. Then the old
gentleman
first took the alarm, and proceeded
instantly to the lodge in quest of his
daughter
;
of their elopement there now remained
no doubt, and an examination into the state
of the colonel's room, who had been thought
not yet risen, gave assurance of it. Here
was at once sad confirmation that the
opinion
of Mr. Holt was a just one. Although
every heart felt for Jane, during this dreadful
explanation, no eye was turned on her
excepting
the stolen and anxious glances of her
sister; but when all was confirmed, and
nothing
remained but to reflect or act upon the
circumstances, she naturally engrossed the
whole attention of her fond parents. Jane
had listened in indignation to the
commencement
of the narrative of Mr. Jarvis, and
so firmly was Egerton enshrined in purity
within her imagination, that not until it was
ascertained that both his servant and clothes
were missing, would she admit a thought
injurious
to his truth. Then indeed the
feelings
of Mr. Jarvis, his plain statement,
corroborated
by this testimony, struck her at
once as true; and as she rose to leave the
room, she fell senseless into the arms of
Emily, who observing her movement and
loss of colour, had flown to her assistance.
Denbigh had drawn the merchant out, in
vain efforts to appease him, and happily no
one witnessed this effect of Jane's passion
but her nearest relatives. She was
immediately
removed to her own room, and, in a
short time, in bed with a burning fever; the
bursts of her grief were uncontrolled and
violent. At times she reproached herselfher
friendsEgerton:in short, she was guilty of
all the inconsistent sensations that
disappointed
hopes, accompanied by the consciousness
of weakness on our part, seldom fails to give
rise to; the presence of her friends was
irksome
to her, and it was only to the soft and
insinuating blandishments of Emily's love,
that she would at all yield; perseverance
and affection at length prevailed, and as
Emily took the opportunity of some
refreshments
to infuse a strong soporific, Jane lost
her consciousness of misery in a temporary
repose. In the mean time, a more
searching
inquiry had been able to trace out the
manner and direction of the journey of the
fugitives.
It appeared the colonel left the lodge
immediately
after his conversation with Sir
Edward
;
he slept at a tavern, and caused his
servant to remove his baggage at day-light;
here he had ordered a chaise and horses, and
then proceeded, as mentioned, to the lodgings
of Mr. Jarviswhat arguments he used with
Miss Jarvis to urge her to so sudden a flight,
remained a secret; but from the remarks of
Mrs. Jarvis and Miss Sarah, there was
reason
to believe that he had induced them to
think from the commencement, that his
intentions
were single, and Mary Jarvis their
object; how he contrived to gloss his
attentions
to Jane, in such a manner as to deceive
those ladies, caused no little surprise; but it
was obvious it was done, and the Moseleys
were not without hopes his situation with
Jane would not make the noise in the world
such occurrences seldom fail to excite. In
the afternoon a letter was handed to Mr.
Jarvis
,
and by him immediately communicated
to the baronet and Denbigh, both of whom
he considered as among his best friends:it
was from Egerton, and written in a
respectful
manner; he apologised for his elopement,
and excused it on the ground of a wish to avoid
the delay of a license, or the publishing of
bans, as he was in hourly expectation of a
summons to his regiment; with many
promises
of making an attentive husband, and
an affectionate son;they were on the road to
Scotland, whence they intended immediately
to return to London, and wait the commands
of their parents. The baronet, in a voice
trembling with emotion at the sufferings of
his own child, congratulated the merchant
that things were no worse; while Denbigh
curled his lips as he read the epistle, and
thought settlements were a greater
inconvenience
than the bansfor it was a well known
fact, a maiden aunt had left the Jarvises
twenty thousand pounds between them.
