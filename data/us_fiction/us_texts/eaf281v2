CHAPTER IX.
Dear scenes of bliss! by fancy given,
To cheat the enraptur'd, gazing eye.
Say why, alas! ye promise Heaven,
And give but disappointment's sigh?
Ah, early years! ye wake my sorrow
Now slowly moves the tedious day,
While sombre shades o'ercloud the morrow,
And shroud the sun's declining ray.
Mrs. Rose
.
The
spring opened with the dreadful
note of preparation throughout America for
defensive war. It was found that vigorous
measures must be pursued to oppose the
torrent
which was preparing to overwhelm the
colonies
,
soon to be for ever separated from the
British empire by the Declaration of
Independence
.
Troops were levying in all parts of the
continent, and great numbers of American
youth volunteered in the service of their
country
.
A large army of reinforcement was shortly
expected from England to land on our shores,
and the confused noise of warriors and
garments
rolled in blood, were already
anticipated
.
Haventon had received a commission in a
regiment of militia, and was pressed by
several
young gentlemen of his acquaintance who
had entered the army to join it also. He had
an excuse: his father was a man in extensive
business, was considerably past the prime of
life, had a number of agents and clerks
under
him, but began to grow unable to attend
to the various and burdensome duties and
concerns of a mercantile life. Alonzo was
his only child; his assistance therefore
became
necessary until at least his father could
bring his business to a close, which he was
now about to effect. He stated these facts to
his friends, told them that on every occasion he
should be ready to fly to the post of danger
when his country was invaded, and that soon
as his father's affairs should be settled he
would, if necessary, willingly repair to the field.
The day now rapidly approached when
Haventon
was to make Miss Bloomfield his own.
Preparations for the mystic ceremony were
VOL. II. A 2
making, and invitations had already gone
abroad
.
Edgar, the brother of Melissa, had
entered the army in the capacity of chaplain;
he was soon expected home, where the
intended
to tarry until the consummation of the
nuptials before he set out for the camp.
Letters
recently received from him announced
his intentions to this effect.
About three weeks previous to the
appointed
marriage day, Alonzo and Melissa one
afternoon
rode out to the village which had
been chosen for their future residence. Their
carriage stopped at the only inn in the place,
and from thence they walked around this
modern
Vacluse, charmed with the secluded
beauties of its situation. They passed a little
time at the spot selected for their habitation;
they projected the structure of the buildings,
planned the gardens, the artificial groves, the
walks, the meads, the fountains, the
green
retreat
of the summer-house, and they already
saw in anticipation the various domestic
blessings
and felicities with which they were to be
surrounded.
After taking tea at the inn, they prepared
to return. It was the latter end of the month
of May, and nature was adorned in the bridal
ornaments of spring: the sun sank behind
groves which cast their sombre shades over
the valley, while the retiring beams of day
adorned the distant eastern eminences with
yellow lustre: birds sang melodiously in
the forest: the air was freshened by light
western breezes, bearing upon their wings all
the intrancing odours of the season: around
the horizon electric clouds raised their brazen
summits, based in the black vapour of
approaching
night. They slowly ascended the
hill south of the town, where they paused a
few moments to enjoy the splendours of the
evening scene. This hill which commanded
a prospect of all the surrounding country, the
distant Sound, and the adjacent towns and
villages, presented to the eye on a single view
perhaps one of the most picturesque
draperies
painted by nature. Alonzo attended
Melissa
to her father's, and the next day
returned
home.
Melissa's spirits were this evening more
than usually exhilirated. The difficulties
were now surmounted which had obstructed
her road to happiness. Previous to the
dismissal
of Bowman she had trembled in
fearful
anxiety for the consequences which might
succeed that event. Her fame, her
reputation
,
she believed in some degree involved
in the result: she doubted whether Bowman
would submit to the decision with calmness:
it might produce an altercation, perhaps a
serious one, between him and Haventon,
whose personal safety might thereby be
endangered
:
the story would then go forth to the
world with invidious exaggerations, whereby
her character would be injured, her innocence
calumniated, and her peace of mind perhaps
destroyed for ever.
But by the discreet and prudent conduct of
her father the affair had been honourably
accommodated
,
and without difficulty. Her
anticipations
were now consoling and pleasing;
the bright beams of felicity gilded the
horizon
of her future prospects.
She retired to rest indulging in the most
cheering reflections: they extended their
influence
to visions of the night; in her dream
she was standing again with Alonzo on the
hill which overlooked the place of their chosen
habitation; she thought they had recently
been married; their seat rose in elegant
convenience
near the verge of the little lake,
surrounded
by gardens, fruit-trees and flowering
shrubs, all in rich bloom: shady avenues
sloped to the water: the landscape around
was beyond description splendid: sheep and
cattle strayed over the pastures; small
rivulets
rushed from the hills and wound along
the fields; light gales sported among the
foliage
of the adjacent forest; interspersed over
a meadow, beautiful in green verdure,
blossomed
apple-trees displayed their red and
white teints, from whence the mild breezes
wafted odours: birds of gaudy plumage
fluttered
around them, or symphoniously carolled
the lay of nature amidst the branches of
adjacent
trees: never had the sky clothed itself
in so bright a hue, the sun so clearly shone, or
creation arrayed herself in so rich, so
enchanting
a dress. They descended to the house;
Edgar met them at the door; there had their
parents and friends assembled; a sumptuous
feast was preparing; all were joyful, all gay,
and mirth and hilarity floated in cheerful
circles
.
Melissa awoke with the most pleasing
sensations: a gentle shower was falling; she
heard it patter upon the roof: again she
closed her eyes, and was lulled to sleep by
the still rains of summer.
Again she dreamed: she thought she was
wandering in a lonely and solitary place,
amidst
scattered groves faded by the frosts of
autumn; yellow, withering leaves were
falling
around her; the breeze sighed in
mournful
cadence with the solemn murmur of a
passing rill; the wailings of expiring insects
were mingled with the stock-dove's plaintive
note; slow and awful came the sound of a
distant bell, tolling the knell of death; a
thick vapour enveloped the sun; dark
thunder-clouds
rolled along the heavens;
boisterous
winds began to rise, while deep in the
forest was heard the commencement of the
rumbling storm. She came to the shores of
the Sound, near a spacious river, foaming,
roaring and rushing to the sea, which raging
in wild commotion was tost into mountainous
billows; soon they burst upon the shore;
instantly
she was surrounded by the flood; a
rocky eminence was near; she ascended it
with difficulty; looking down, she beheld a
deep, horrid chasm yawning beneath her feet;
suddenly she heard cries of distress; casting
her eyes in the direction whence they came,
she saw a little skiff struggling with the
violence
of the stream; the person who vainly
endeavoured to guide it she immediately
perceived
to be Alonzo; a large mass of timber
broken by the gale was floating rapidly down
the river towards him; he raised his hands
and eyes to Heaven as it approached the skiff;
quickly it reached him, overwhelmed and
swept him with amazing velocity to the ocean.
Melissa shrieked, and in stretching out her
arms towards the place where he had
disappeared
,
sunk into the abyss below: at that
moment a voice sounded these words in her
earsit seemed the dying voice of
Alonzo
The memory of joys that are past is the
last joy to the unfortunate
. She awoke in
extreme
agitation, thankful to Heaven that her
dream was not a reality.
Daylight had appeared and she arose: she
placed not much faith in dreams, yet she
knew the Scriptures testified that they were
formerly the precursors of important events;
those two she had now experienced were of a
direct contrary tendency; which, if either, was
she to consider predictive? The first was in
harmony with her feelings, and had arisen
probably
from her daily contemplations, and the
scenes through which she had recently
passed
:
the last was extraordinary; she feared
it was ominous; it made so deep an
impression
upon her mind that it was several days
before she recovered her usual tranquility and
accustomed cheerfulness.
A few days after these events Haventon's
father went to one of the commercial seaports
on business with some merchants with whom
he was connected in trade; when he returned
the following evening his aspect and his
conversation
were marked with an assumed and
unmeaning gaiety: at supper he ate nothing,
discoursed much, but in an unconnected and
hurried manner, interrupted by long pauses,
in which he appeared to be buried in
contemplation
:
after supper he asked his son if it were
not possible that his marriage could be
immediately
consummated. Alonzo, startled at so
unexpected a question, replied that such a
proposal
would be considered extraordinary,
perhaps
improper; besides, when Melissa fixed
the time, she mentioned that she had an uncle
who lived near Charleston in South-Carolina,
whose daughter was to pass the summer at
Bloomfield Vale, and was expected to arrive
before the appointed marriage day. It would,
he said, be a delicate point for him to solicit
her to anticipate the nuptials, so soon to be
celebrated, unless he could give some
powerful
reasons for the request, and at present he
was not apprized that any such existed. His
father
after a few moments hesitation answered,
I have reasons, which when told here
he stopped, suddenly arose, hastily walked
the room in much apparent agony of mind,
and then retired to his chamber.
Haventon and his mother were much
amazed
at so strange a proceeding: they could
form no conjecture of its cause or its
consequence
.
Alonzo passed a sleepless night.
His father's slumbers were interrupted; he
would frequently start up in the bed, then sink
into restless sleep with incoherent mutterings
and plaintive moans. In the morning when
he appeared at breakfast his countenance wore
the marks of dejection and anguish; he
scarcely uttered a word, and after the table was
removed ordered all to withdraw except his
wife and son, when with emotions that spoke
the painful feelings of his bosom, he thus
addressed
them:
For more than forty years I have toiled
early and late to acquire independence and
case for myself and family: to accomplish
this I became connected with some English,
VOL. II. B
importing merchants and went largely into
the British trade: success crowned our
endeavours
:
on balancing our accounts two
years ago we found our expectations fully
answered
,
and that we were sufficiently wealthy
to close business, which some proposed to do;
it was however agreed to make one effort
more, as certain favourable circumstances
appeared
to offer; in this we adventured very
largely on a fair calculation of liberal and
extensive
profits; before returns could be made
the war came on; embarrassments ensued,
and by indubitable intelligence lately received
we find that our property in England has been
sequestrated; five of our ships laden with
British goods, lying in English harbours and
just ready to sail for America, have been
seized as lawful prizes: added to this, three
vessels from the Indies freighted with island
produce, have been taken on their homeward
bound passage, and one lost returning from
Holland. This wreck of fortune I might
have survived, had I to sustain only my equal
dividend of the loss; but of the merchants
with whom I have been concerned, not one
remains
to share the fate of the event; all have
absconded or secreted themselves. To
attempt
to compound with my creditors would
be of little avail; my whole fortune will not
pay one fourth of the debts, so that
compound
or not the consequence to me is
inevitable
ruin.
To abscond would not secure me, as most
of my remaining property is vested in real
estate; and even if it would, I could never
submit to it; I could not consent to banish
myself from my country, to flee like a felon,
to skulk from society with the base view of
defrauding my creditors: no, I have lived
honestly
and honestly will I die. By fair
application
and long industry my wealth has been
obtained, and it shall never justly be said
that the reputation of my latter days was
stained with acts of baseness and meanness.
I have notified and procured a meeting of the
creditors, and have laid the matter before
them: some appeared favourable to me; others
insisted that we were all united in fraudulent
designs and for swindling purposes: this false
charge I repelled with becoming spirit, and
was in consequence threatened with
immediate
prosecution. Whatever may be the
event, I had some hopes that your happiness,
Alonzo, might yet be secured: hence I
proposed
your union with Melissa before our
misfortunes should be promulgated. Your
parents are old; a little will serve the residue
of their days. With your acquirements you
may make your way in life. I shall have no
property to give you, but I would wish you to
secure that which you prize far above, and
without which both honours and emoluments
are unimportant and worthless.At this
moment
a loud rap at the door interrupted the
discourse, and three men were ushered in,
who proved to be the sheriff and his
attendants
,
sent by the more inexorable creditors of
Alonzo's father and company, to level on the
property of the former, which orders they
faithfully executed by seizing the lands,
tenements
and furniture, and finally arresting the
old gentleman, but who was instantly released
by his friendly neighbours, who gave bail for
his appearance; but the property was soon
after sold at public auction for less than half
its real value, and Haventon's father and
mother
were compelled to abandon the premises,
leave the town and take shelter in a little hut
belonging to a neighbouring farmer, illy and
temporarily furnished by the gratuitous
liberality
of a few friends.
We will not stop the reader to moralize on
this disastrous event. The affliction of the
family, thus hurled in a moment from the
lofty summit of affluence to the low and
barren
vale of poverty, can better be
apprehended
than described. Philosophy came to the
aid of the parents, but who can realize the
feelings of the son, so suddenly cut short in
his prospects, not only of independence, but
even of future support! What would be the
event of his suit to Melissa, and stipulated
marriage? Was it not probable that her
father
would now cancel the contract? Could
she consent to become his wife in his present
penurious situation? And indeed, could he
himself wish to make her so to render her
miserable?
In this agitated frame of mind Alonzo
received
a letter from Vincent requesting him
to come immediately to his house, whither he
repaired the following day: he had heard of
the calamities which had overwhelmed the
Haventon family, and deeply sympathized in
their distress. Mrs. Vincent and Melissa
were on terms of friendly acquaintance.
VOL. II. B 2
When Alonzo arrived at the house of his
friend he was received with the same
disinterested
ardour he ever had been in the days
of his most unbounded prosperity. The
occasion of my sending for you, said
Vincent
,
is to propose the adoption of certain
measures which I doubt not may be highly
beneficial as it respects your future peace and
happiness. Your family misfortunes have
reached the ears of Col. Bloomfield; I know
the old gentleman too well to believe he will
consent to receive you as his son-in-law under
your present embarrassments. Money is the
god to which he implicitly bows. The case
is difficult but not insurmountable: you must
first see Melissa; she is now in the next room;
I will conduct you in; converse with her; after
which I will lay my plan before you.
Alonzo entered the room; Melissa was
sitting
by a window which looked into a
pleasant
garden, and over verdant meadows whose
tall grass waved to the passing breeze; farther
on low valleys spread their umbrageous
thickets
,
where the dusky shadows of night had
begun to assemble: on high hills beyond, the
tops of lofty forests, majestically moved by
the billowy gales, caught the sun's last ray;
fleecy summer clouds hovered around the
verge of the western horizon, spangled with
silvery teints, or fringed with the gold of
evening
;
a mournfully murmuring rivulet purled
at a little distance from the garden on the
borders of a small grove, from whence the
American wild-dove wafted her sympathetic
moanings to Miss Bloomfield's ear. She sat
leaning on a small table by the window which
was thrown up; her attention was fixed; she
did not perceive Vincent and Haventon as
they entered: they advanced towards her;
she turned, started and arose: with a
melancholy
smile and tremulous voice, I
supposed
,
she said, that it was Mrs. Vincent
who was approoaching, as she has just left the
room. Her countenance appeared dejected,
which on her seeing Alonzo lighted up into a
languid sprightliness. It was evident she had
been weeping.
Vincent retired and they seated themselves
by the window. I have broken in upon
your solitude perhaps too unseasonably, said
Alonzo; it is however the fault of Vincent;
he invited me to walk into the room, but did
not inform me that you was alone.
Your presence was sudden and
unexpected
,
but not unseasonable, replied Melissa;
I hope you do not consider any formality
necessary in your visits, Alonzo.
Alonzo
. I once did not suppose so; now I
know not what to thinkI know not how to
act. You have learnt the misfortunes of my
family, Melissa?
Melissa
. Yes; I have heard the
circumstances
attending that event; an event in
which no one could be more deeply interested,
except the immediate sufferers, than myself.
Al
. Your father is also acquainted with my
present situation?
Mel
. He is.
Al
. How did he receive the intelligence?
Mel
. With deep regret.
Al
. And forbade you to admit my
addresses
any longer?
Mel
. No; not absolutely.
Al
. If even in an unqualified and indirect
manner it is proper I should know it.
Mel
. It certainly is. Soon after we
received
the intelligence of your calamities my
father came into the room where I was sitting,
Melissa, said he, your conduct has ever
been that of a dutiful child; mine of an
indulgent
parent. My first and ultimate wish is
to see my children when settled in life happy
and honourably respected: for this purpose I
have bestowed on them a proper education,
and design suitably to apportion my property
between them; on their part it is expected
they will act prudently and discreetly,
especially
in those things which concern their future
peace and welfare; the principal requisite to
ensure
these is a proper connexion in marriage.
Here he paused a considerable time, and
then continued:
I know, my child, that your situation is
a very delicate one: your marriage day is
appointed; it was fixed under the
fairest
prospects; by the failure of Haventon's
house those prospects have become deeply
darkened, if not totally obliterated. To
commit
your fortune through life to a person
unable
to support you, would be hazardous in
the extreme: the marriage can at least be
suspended; perhaps something more
favourable
may appear; at any rate, I have too
much confidence in your discretion to suppose
that you will by any rash act bring either
censure
or reproach upon yourself, or odium and
dishonour upon your connexions. Thus
spake my father and immediately withdrew.
In the present dilemma, said Alonzo,
what is proper to be done?
It is difficult to determine, replied
Melissa
;
should my father expressly forbid
our union, he will as positively endeavour to
enforce his commands; nor could I consider
it my duty to resist them. Although a tender
parent, he is violent in his prejudices and
resolute
in his purposes. I would advise you to
visit me tomorrow with your usual freedom.
Whatever may be the result, I shall deal
sincerely
with you. The Vincents are now my
only confidents; from them you will be
enabled
to obtain information should I be
prevented
seeing you. I am frequently here; they told
me they expected you, but at what day was
not known. Mrs. Vincent is my friend; her
husband you know: in them we can place
the most implicit confidence. My reliance
on Providence I trust will never be shaken,
but my future prospects at present are dark
and discouraging.
Let us not despair, answered Alonzo,
perhaps those gloomy clouds which now
hover around us will yet be dissipated by the
bright beams of joy. Innocence and virtue
are the care of Heaven; there lies my hope.
Tomorrow, as you propose, I will call at
your house.
Melissa prepared to return home;
Haventon
attended her to her father's door. A
whipperwill tuned its nightly song at a little
distance; but the sound, late so cheerful and
sprightly, now passed heavily over their
hearts.
When Alonzo returned Vincent unfolded
the plan he had projected. No sooner,
said he, was I informed of your
misfortunes
than I was convinced that Col.
Bloomfield
would endeavour to dissolve your
intended
union with his daughter. I have
known him many years, and however he may
prize his children or value their happiness, he
will not hesitate to sacrifice his other feelings
to the acquirement of riches. It appears that
you have but one resource left; you and
Melissa
are now united by the most solemn ties, by
every rite except those which are merely
ceremonial
:
these I would advise you to enter
into and trust to the consequences. Mrs.
Vincent has proposed the scheme to Melissa,
but implicitly accustomed to parental
obedience
,
she shudders at the idea of a
clandestine
marriage; yet when her father shall
proceed
to rigorous measures, she will, I think,
consent to the alternative; and this course
once adopted, he must submit; or if not, you
secure your own happiness, and what you
esteem more, that of Melissa.
But should she consent to this measure,
which I much doubt, replied Alonzo, where
are my means of independence, or even of
subsistence?
The world is before you, answered
Vincent
,
you have friends who will never
desert
you, you have acquirements which can
never fail you. In a country like this you
can hardly fail of obtaining a competency,
which with the other requisites will ensure
you contentment and felicity. Alonzo
informed
Vincent what had been arranged
between
Melissa and himself respecting his
visiting
her on the morrow, after which, said
he, we will discourse farther upon the
subject
.
The next day he repaired to the house of
Col. Bloomfield. As he approached he saw
Melissa sitting in a shady recess at one end of
the garden, near which the road passed: she
was leaning with her head upon her hand in a
pensive posture; a deep dejection was
depicted
upon her features, which enlivened into a
transient glow soon as she saw Alonzo. She
arose, met him, and invited him into the
house.
He was received with cool reserve by her
father, who saluted him with only a distant
and retiring bow as he passed with Melissa to
the sitting-room. Soon as they were seated
her aunt entered, and bounced into a chair,
where she sat, alternately humming a tune,
and impudently staring at Alonzo without
speaking a word, except snappishly to
contradict
VOL. II. C
Melissa in any thing she advanced, which
the latter passed off with only a faint smile.
This interruption was not of long
continuance
;
Col. Bloomfield soon came in and
requested
the two ladies to withdraw, which was
instantly done. He then addressed Alonzo
as follows:
When I gave consent for you to marry
my daughter it was on the conviction that
your future resources would be adequate to
support her honourably and independently.
Circumstances have since occurred which
render this point extremely doubtful.
Parental
duty and affection demand that I should
know your means and prospects before I
sanction a proceeding which may reduce my
child to penury and to want.
He paused for a reply, but Alonzo was
silent
.
He continued
You must readily perceive that to
burden
yourself with the expense of a family,
to transfer a woman from affluence to
poverty
,
without even an object in view whereby
to provide for either, would be the height of
folly and extravagance.
Again he paused, but Alonzo was still
silent
.
He proceeded
Could you, Mr. Haventon, endure life,
when you should see the wife of your bosom,
probably your infant children, pining in
misery
for want of bread? And what else have
you to expect if you marry in your present
situation? I know you possess talents, and
have had an education; but what are they
without means? You have friends who respect
you; but which of them will advance you
four or five thousand pounds as a gratuity?
My daughter must be supported according to
her character and station in life: are you
enabled
to do this? If not, you cannot
reasonably
suppose that I shall accede to your
marrying
her. You may say that your
acquirements
,
your prudence and your industry will
procure you a competent support; in single
life perhaps they might; but to depend on
these for the future exigencies of a family, is
hazarding peace, honour and reputation at a
single game of chance. If therefore you
have no resources, or expectations but such as
these, your own judgment, your own
discretion
will teach you the necessity of
immediately
relinquishing all pretensions to the
hand of my daughter. He then retired.
Why was Alonzo speechless through the
whole of this discourse? What reply could
he have made? What were the prospects
before
him but penury, want, misery and woe?
Where indeed were the means by which Miss
Bloomfield was to be supported in style, or
even shielded from poverty, if connected with
his fortunes? The idea was not new, but it
came upon him with redoubled anguish. He
arose and looked around for Melissa, but she
was not to be seen; he left the house and
walked
slowly towards Vincent's; at a little
distance
he met her; she had been strolling in an
adjoining avenue: he informed her of all that
had passed; it was no more than they both
expected, yet it was a shock their fortitude
could scarcely sustain. Disappointment,
though anticipated, seldom finds her victims
prepared to receive her.
Melissa told Alonzo that her father's
determinations
were unchangeable; that his
sister
held considerable power over him and
dictated
the concerns of the family, and that from
her there was nothing to hope in their favour.
Her mother, she said, was her friend, but
could not counteract the will of her father.
Edgar would be at home in a few days; how
he would act on this occasion she was unable
to say; but were he even in their interest, he
would have but feeble influence with her father
and aunt. What is to be the end of these
troubles, she continued, it is impossible to
foresee; let us trust in the mercy of Heaven,
and submit to its dispensations.
In their happier days they had, when absent,
corresponded by letters: this method it was
now thought best to relinquish. It was
agreed
that Alonzo should come frequently to
Vincent's, where Melissa would meet him as
opportunity presented. Having concluded on
this, she returned home and he to the house
of his friend.
Vincent, after Haventon had related the
manner of his reception by Col. Bloomfield,
urged the plan he had projected of a private
marriage. Alonzo replied that even should
Melissa agree to it, of which he had little
hopes, it must be a measure of the last resort,
and adopted only when all others became
ineffectual
.
VOL. II. C 2
The next morning Alonzo returned to the
hut where his aged parents now dwelt.
His bosom throbbed with keen anguish: his
own fate unconnected with that of Melissa,
he considered of little consequence; but their
united situation tortured his soul. What was
to become of her; what of himself; what of
his parents? Alas! said he, I now
perceive
the value of wealth in this life.
Haventon's father was absent when he
arrived
,
but returned soon after: a beam of
joy gleamed upon his withered countenance as
he entered the house. Were it not,
Alonzo
,
for your unhappy situation, said he, we
should once more be restored to peace and
comfort. A few persons who were indebted
to me, finding that I was to be sacrificed by
my unfeeling creditors, reserved those debts
in their hands, and have now paid me the sum,
amounting to something more than five
hundred
pounds; with part of this I have bought
a small but well cultivated farm with
convenient
buildings. I have enough left to
purchase
what stock and other materials I need,
and to spare some for your present
exigencies
,
my son. Alonzo thanked his father
for his kindness, but told him that from his
former liberality he had yet sufficient for his
wants, and that he should soon find business
which would amply support him.
But your affair with Miss Bloomfield,
asked his father, how is that likely to
terminate
?
Favourably, I hope, Sir, he answered:
he was unwilling to interrupt the tranquility
of his parents by disclosing his own
wretchedness
.
A week passed away. Alonzo saw his
parents
removed to their little farm, which was
to be managed by his father and a hired man.
He saw them comfortably settled; he saw
them serenely blest in the calm pleasures of
returning peace, and a ray of joy illumined
his troubled bosom.
Again the youth his wonted life regain'd;
A transient sparkle in his eye obtain'd;
A bright, impassion'd, cheering glow, express'd
The pleas'd sensations of his feeling breast.
But soon dark glooms the feeble smiles o'erspread;
Like morn's gay hues the fading splendours fled;
Returning anguish froze his feeling soul,
Deep sighs burst forth and tears began to roll.
He thought on Melissa, from whom he had
heard nothing since he last saw her; he
contemplated
the difficulties that surrounded
him; he reflected upon the barriers which
were opposed to his happiness, and to the
felicity
of her whose peace he valued much
higher
than his own, and he set out for the house
of Vincent.
CHAPTER X.
For here the voice of mirth is heard no more;
A silent sadness o'er the scene prevails;
The distant main alone is heard to roar,
And hollow chimneys hum with sullen gales.
Humphreys
.
Alonzo
arrived at the residence of
his friend near the close of day. Vincent
and his wife were at tea with several young
ladies who had passed the afternoon with
Mrs. Vincent. Haventon cast an active
glance around the company in hopes to find
Melissa, but she was not there. On
invitation
,
he accepted a seat in the circle. After
tea, Vincent led him into an adjoining room:
You have come in good time, said he;
something must speedily be done or you
lose Miss Bloomfield for ever: the day after
you left here her father received a letter from
Bowman, in which, after alluding to the
circumstances
of your father's insolvency, he
hinted that the consequence might probably be
a failure of the proposed marriage, which
might essentially injure the reputation of a
lady
so delicately situated, and of so respectable
a character and family; to prevent which, and
to place her beyond the reach of calumny, he
offered to marry her at any appointed day,
provided he had her free consent. As
Bowman
by the recent death of his father has
been put in possession of a splendid fortune,
the proposition allured the Colonel, who
wrote him a complaisant answer, with an
invitation
to his house. He then endeavoured to
extort a promise from Melissa that she would
break off all connexion with you, and admit
the addresses of Bowman: to this she could not
consent; she urged that with the approbation
of her parents she was engaged to you by the
most solemn ties; that to her father's will she
had hitherto yielded implicit obedience, but
that hastily to break such sacred obligations,
formed, sanctioned and approved by him,
was what her conscience would not permit her
to do. Were he to command her to live
single
,
life might be endured, but to give her
hand to any except to you, would be to
perjure
those principles of truth and justice
which he himself had ever taught her to hold
most inviolable. Her father grew outrageous;
charged her with disobedience, with a blind
inconsiderate
perverseness, by which she would
bring ruin upon herself and indelible disgrace
upon her family. She answered only with her
tears. Her mother interposed and
endeavoured
to appease his anger, but he spurned her
from him, and rushed out of the room,
uttering
a threat that force should succeed
persuasion
if his commands were not obeyed. To
add to Melissa's distress, Bowman arrived
yesterday; and I hope in some measure to
alleviate it, Edgar, her brother, came this
morning. Mrs. Vincent's visitors have
departed
,
and she has despatched a message to
inform Melissa of your arrival, and to request
her to come her immediately. She will
undoubtedly
comply with the invitation if not
prevented by something extraordinary. I
should have written you had I not hourly
expected
your arrival.
Mrs. Vincent now came to the door of the
room and beckoned to her husband, who went
out, but instantly returned leading in
Melissa
,
after which he retired. Oh, Alonzo!
was all she could say, and burst into tears.
Haventon led her to a seat, gently pressed
her hand, and mingled his tears with hers,
but was unable to speak. Recovering at
length, he begged her to moderate her grief:
Where is your fortitude and your firmness,
said he, Melissa, which I have so often
seen triumphing over affliction? Her
extreme
anguish prevented reply. Deeply
affected
and alarmed at the storm of distress
which raged in her bosom, he endeavoured to
console her, though consolation was a stranger
to his own breast. Let us not, he
continued
,
increase our flood of afflictions by
a tide of useless sorrow: perhaps more
prosperous
days are yet in reserve for us;
happiness
may still be ours.
Never, never! she exclaimed, Oh,
what will become of me?
Heaven cannot desert you; said
Alonzo
;
as well might it forsake its angels.
This thorny and gloomy path may lead to
fair fields of light and verdure. Tempests
are succeeded by calms; war ends in peace;
the splendours of the brightest morning arise
on the wings of blackest midnight:
troubles
with not always last: life at most is short;
death comes to the relief of the virtuous
wretched, and transports them to another and
a better world, where sighing and sorrows
cease, and the tempestuous passions are known
no more.
The
rage of grief
which had overwhelmed
Melissa, began now to subside, as the waves
of the ocean gradually cease their tumultuous
agitation after the turbulent winds are laid
asleep
.
Deep sobs and long drawn sighs
succeeded
to a suffocation of tears. The
irritation
of her feelings had caused a more than
usual glow upon her cheek, which faded away
as she became composed, until a livid
paleness
spread itself over her features. Alonzo
feared that the delicacy of her constitution
would fall a sacrifice to the sorrow which
preyed upon her heart, if not speedily
alleviated
;
but where, alas, were the means of
alleviation!
She informed him that her father had that
evening ordered her to prepare to become the
wife of Bowman; her disobedience, he said,
was no longer to be borne; No longer,
he exclaimed, will I tamper with your
perverseness
;
you are determined to be poor,
wretched and contemptible; I will compel
you to be rich, happy and respected. You
suffer the
jack-a-lantern
, fancy, to lead you
VOL. II. D
into swamps and quagmires, when, did you
but follow the fair light of reason, it would
conduct you to honour and real felicity.
Happiness
and misery await your choice: marry
Bowman, and you roll in your coach and
flaunt in your silks; your furniture and your
equipage are splendid, your associates of the
first character, and your family rejoice in your
prosperity: marry Haventon, and you sink into
obscurity, are condemned to drudgery, poorly
fed, worse clothed, and your relations and
acquaintance
shun and despise you. The
comparison
I have here drawn between Bowman and
Haventon is a correct one, for even the
wardrobe
of the former is of more value than the
whole fortune of the latter. I give you now
two days for consideration and reflection; at
the end of that time I shall expect your
decision
,
and hope you will decide discreetly:
but remember, that you become the wife of
Bowman, or you are no longer acknowledged
as my daughter.
Thus, said Melissa, did my father
pronounce his determination, which shook my
frame, and chilled with horror every nerve
of my heart, and immediately left me. My
aunt added her taunts to his severities, and
Bowman interfered with his ill-timed
consolation
.
My mother and Edgar ardently strove
to allay the fever of my soul, and mitigate
my distress: but the stroke was almost too
severe for my nature. Habituated only to
the smiles of my father, how could I support
his frowns! Accustomed to receive his
blessings
alone, how could I endure his sudden
malediction!
Description would fail in painting the
sensations
of Alonzo's bosom at this recital of woe;
but the endeavoured to mitigate her sorrows
by the consoling hope of more cheering
prospects
and happier hours.
Vincent and his lady came into the room:
they strenuously urged the propriety and the
necessity of an immediate and inseparable
union between the distressed pair. It will at
least disperse the clouds of affliction which
now surround you, said Mrs. Vincent, and
in future you can scarcely anticipate superior
calamity.
The measure would be hazardous,
remarked
Melissa.
My circumstances, said Alonzo
Not on that account, interrupted she,
but my father's displeasure
Will be the same whether you marry
Alonzo
or refuse to marry Bowman, replied
Vincent.
Her resolution appeared to be shaken.
Come here, Melissa, tomorrow evening,
said Mrs. Vincent; mean time you will
consider
the matter and then determine. To
this she assented, and prepared to return
home.
Haventon walked with her to the gate which
opened into the yard surrounding her father's
house: it was dangerous for him to go farther;
should he be discovered with Melissa, even by
a domestic of the family, it must increase the
persecutions against her. They parted: he
stood at the gate, gazing anxiously after her
as she walked up the long winding avenue,
bordered with the odour-flowering lilac and
lofty elm, her white robes now invisible, now
dimly seen, as she turned the angles of the
walk, until they were totally obscured, mingling
with the gloom and darkness of the night.
Thus, thought he, fades the angel of peace
from the visionary eyes of the war-worn
soldier
,
when it ascends in the dusky clouds of
early morning, while he slumbers on the field of
recent battle. With mournful forebodings
he returned to the house of Vincent.
He arose after a sleepless night and walked
into an adjoining field. He stood leaning in
deep contemplation against a tree, when he
heard quick footsteps behind him; he turned
and saw Edgar approaching; in a moment
they were in each other's arms and mingled
tears; they returned to Vincent's and
conversed
largely on present affairs.
I have discoursed with my father on the
subject, said Edgar; I have urged him
with every possible argument to relinquish
his determination; I fear however he is
inflexible
.
To assuage the tempest of distress
which rent Melissa's bosom, was my next
object
,
and in this I have not been unsuccessful;
you will see her this evening and will find her
more calm and resigned. You, Alonzo,
must exert your fortitude: the ways of
Heaven
VOL. II. D 2
are inscrutable, but they are right; we
must acquiesce in its dealings; we cannot
alter
its decrees: resignation to its will,
whether
merciful or afflictive, is one of those
eminent
virtues which adorn the good man's
character
,
and which ever find a brilliant reward
in the regions of unsullied splendour, far
beyond
trouble and the tomb.
Edgar told Alonzo that circumstances
compelled
him that day to depart for the army.
I would advise you, he continued, to
remain here until your affair comes to some
final issue; it must, I think, ere long be
determined
;
possibly my father may relent;
perhaps you and my sister may yet be happy.
Haventon feelingly expressed his gratitude
to Bloomfield. He found in him that
disinterested
friendship which his early youth had
experienced. Edgar the same day departed
for the army.
In the afternoon Alonzo received a note
from Melissa's father, requesting his
immediate
attendance. Surprised at the incident,
he repaired there instantly. The servant
introduced
him into a room where Col.
Bloomfield
and his sister were sitting: the former
motioned him to a seat, and then thus
addressed
him:
Understanding you were in the
neighbourhood
,
I have sent for you to make a
proposition
,
with which, after what has taken
place, I think you cannot hesitate to comply.
The occurrence of previous circumstances
may lead you to suppose that my daughter is
under obligations to you, which may render
it improper for her to form marriage
connexions
with any other. Whatever
embarrassments
your addresses to her may have
produced
,
it is in your power to remove them,
and if you are a man of honour you will not
hesitate to do so. You cannot wish to
involve
Melissa in your present penurious
condition
,
unless you are willing to make her
wretched. It therefore only remains for you
to give me a writing voluntarily resigning all
pretensions to the hand of my daughter; and
if you desire she may be happy, honourable
and respected in life, this, I say, you will
readily do.
He paused.
I cannot perceive, replied Haventon,
any particular advantage that can arise from
such a measure; it will neither increase nor
diminish the power you possess to command
obedience to your will, if you are determined
to command it, either from your daughter
or your servant.
There, brother, bawled Miss Martha,
half squeaking through her nose which was
well charged with
rappee
, there! did'nt I
tell you so? I knew the fellow would come to
no terms, no more than will your refractory
daughter. This love fairly bewitches such
foolish, crack-brained youngsters. But say,
Mr.what's your name, addressing herself
to Haventon, will love heat the oven? Will
love boil the pot? Will love clothe the back?
Will love
You will not, interrupted Col.
Bloomfield
,
speaking to Alonzo, it seems, accede
to my proposition. I have then one demand to
make, which of right you cannot resist;
promise
me that you will never see my daughter
again unless by my permission.
At the present moment I am prepared to
promise you nothing, Sir, replied Alonzo,
with some warmth.
There, again, exclaimed the old maid,
just so Melissa told you this morning when
you requested her to see
him
no more. The
fellow has certainly crazed her. If I had him
to deal with! Things wasn't so when I was
a girl; I kept the rogues at a distance, I'll
warrant you. I always told you, brother,
what would come of your indulgence to your
daughter; and I should not wonder were you
soon to find that the girl had eloped, and your
desk robbed into the bargain.
Alonzo hastily arose; I suppose, said
he, my presence may be dispensed with.
Well, young man, said Col. Bloomfield,
since you will not comply with any overtures
I make; since you will not accede to any
terms I propose, remember, Sir, I now warn
you to break off all communication and
correspondence
with Melissa, and to relinquish
every expectation concerning her. I shall
never consent to marry my daughter to a
beggar.
Beggar! involuntarily exclaimed
Alonzo
,
and his eyes flashed resentment; but he
recollected that it was the father of Melissa
who had thus insulted him, and he suppressed
his indignation. He rushed out of the house
and returned to Vincent's. He had neither
heard nor seen any thing of Melissa or
Bowman
.
Night came on, and he ardently and
anxiously
expected Melissa; he anticipated the
consolation her presence would bestow.
Edgar
had told him she was more composed;
he doubted whether it were proper to excite
anew her distress by relating his interview
with her father, unless she was already
apprized
of it. The evening passed on, but
she came not. Alonzo grew restless and
uneasy
;
he looked out, then at his watch;
Vincent
and his lady assured him she would soon
be there: he paced the room; still he
became
more impatient: he walked out on the
way she was expected to come; sometimes
he advanced hastily, at others he moved
slowly; then stood motionless, listening in
breathless silence, momentarily expecting to
discover her white form approaching through
the gloom, or to hear the sound of her
footsteps
advancing amidst the darkness.
Shapeless
objects, either real or imaginary,
frequently
crossed his sight, but like all unreal
phantoms of night, they suddenly passed
away and were seen no more. At length he
perceived a dusky white form advancing in
the distant, dim obscurity: it drew near;
his heart beat quick; his fond hopes told him
it was Melissa; the object came up and
hastily
passed him with a
Good night, Sir
.It
was a stranger in a white surtout. Alonzo
hesitated whether to advance or to return. It
was possible, though not probable, that
Mclissa
might have come some other way. He
hastened back to Vincent's; she had not
arrived
.
Something extraordinary, said
Mrs. Vincent, has prevented her coming;
perhaps she is ill. Alonzo shuddered at the
suggestion: he again looked at his watch; it
was half past eleven o'clock: he instantly
sallied out and took the road to her father's.
The night was exceedingly dark and
illuminated
only by the feeble glimmer of half
clouded twinkling stars. When he came
within sight of the house, and as he drew
nearer, no lights were visible, all was still and
silent. He entered the yard, walked up the
avenue and approached the door: the familiar
watch-dog which lay near the threshold fawned
upon him, joyfully whining and wagging his
tail: Thou still knowest me,
Curlow
, said
Alonzo, thou hast known me in better days;
I am now poor and wretched, but thy
friendship
is still the same; how much more
benevolent
art thou than man!
A death-like stillness prevailed all around,
interrupted only by the discordance of the
nightly insect and the hooting of the solemn
owl from a neighbouring forest. The
dwelling
was shrouded in darkness: in Melissa's
room no gleam of light appeared. They
are all buried in sleep, said he, deeply
sighing, and I have only to return in
disappointment
.
He then walked towards the
street; casting a glance back, the blaze of a
candle caught his eye; it passed rapidly
along
the lower rooms, now gleaming, now
intercepted
,
as the walls or the windows
intervened
,
and suddenly disappeared; he gazed
earnestly a few moments, and hastily
returned
:
no noise was to be heard, no new object
was discernable: he clambered over the
garden
wall and went around to the back side of
the house; there all was dark and silent as
in front: immediately a faint light appeared
through one of the upper casements, it grew
brighter, a candle entered the chamber, the
sash was flung up and Melissa seated herself
at the window.
The weather was sultry; she held a fan in
her hand; her countenance though stamped
with deep dejection was marked with
serenity
,
but pale as the drooping lily of the valley.
Haventon placed himself directly under the
window and in a low voice called her by name.
She started wildly, looked out and faintly
cried Who's there?
He answered Alonzo.
Good heavens! she exclaimed, Is it
you? I was disappointed in meeting you at
Vincent's this evening; my father will not
suffer me to go out without attendants. I am
now constantly watched and strictly
guarded
.
Guarded! he replied; At the risk of
my life I will rescue you from the tyranny
with which you are oppressed.
VOL. II. E
Be calm, Alonzo, said she; I think it
will not long last: Bowman will soon depart,
after which there will undoubtedly be some
alteration. Desire Mrs. Vincent to come
here tomorrow; I believe they will trust me
to see her; I can from time to time inform
you of passing events, so that you may know
what changes take place. I am placed under
the care of my aunt, who suffers me not to
step out of her sight. We pass the night in
an adjoining apartment, from whence, after
she had fallen asleep, I stole out and went
down with a design to walk in the garden,
but found the doors all locked and the keys
taken out: I returned and raised this window
for fresh air. Hark! she continued, my
aunt calls me; she has waked and misses me;
I must fly to her chamber. You shall hear
more from me tomorrow by Mrs. Vincent,
Alonzo. She then let down the window
and retired.
Haventon withdrew slowly from the place,
and repassed the way he came. As he sprang
back over the garden wall, he found a man
standing at its foot very near him: after a
moment's scrutiny he perceived it to be
Bowman
.
What, my chevalier, said he to
Alonzo
,
such an adept in the amorous science
already? Hast thou then eluded the watchful
eyes of Argus and the vigilance of the
dragon
?
Unfeeling and impertinent intruder!
retorted
Haventon, seizing hold of him, Is
it not enough that an innocent daughter
endure
a merciless parent's persecuting hand,
but must thou add to her misery by thy
disgusting
interference!
Quit thy hold, Tarquin, said Bowman;
art thou determined after storming the
fortress
to murder the garrison?
Go! replied Alonzo, quitting him;
Go, Sir! you are unworthy of my anger.
Pursue thy grovelling schemes; strive to
force to your arms a lady who abhors you,
and were it on no other account must ever
continue to despise and hate you.
Haventon, answered Bowman, I
perceive
thou knowest me not. You and I were
rivals in one pursuitthe hand of Miss
Bloomfield. Whether from freak or fancy,
the preference was given to you, and I retired
in silence. From a coincidence of
consequences
her father has now been induced to
give that preference to me. My belief was
that Melissa would comply with her father's
will, especially after her prospects of
connecting
with you were cut off by the events which
have ruined your fortune. You, Haventon,
have yet, I find, to learn the character of
women
;
it has been my particular study. Miss
Bloomfield, now ardently impassioned by first
impressions, irritated by recent
disappointment
,
her passions delicate and vivid, her
affections
animated and unmixed, it would be
strange if she could suddenly relinquish
primitive
attachments founded on such premises
without a struggle; but remove her from
your presence for one short year, with only
distant and uncertain prospects of seeing you
again; admit me as the substitute in your
absence
,
and she accepts my hand as freely as
she would now receive yours. I had no
design
,
it was never my wish, to marry her
without her voluntary consent; that I believe
will yet be obtained. Under existing
circumstances
it is impossible but that you must be
separated for some considerable time; then,
when cool deliberation succeeds to the wild
vagaries, the electric fires of frolic fancy, she
will discover the dangerous precipice, the
deadly abyss to which her present conduct and
inclinations lead; she will see that the
blandishments
without the possessions of life
must fade and die; will discriminate between
the shreds and the trappings of taste, and
prefer indifference and splendour to love and
a cottage. At present I relinquish all farther
pursuit: tomorrow I return to New-London.
When Melissa, from calm deliberation and
the advice of friends, shall cheerfully agree
to yield me her hand, I will return and receive
it. I came from my lodgings this evening to
declare these intentions to her father, but it
being later than I was aware of, the family
had retired to rest; I was about to return,
when I saw a light from the chamber window,
which soon withdrew; I stood a moment by
the garden wall, when you approached and
discovered me. So saying, he bade Alonzo
good night, and walked hastily away.
I find he understands not the character
of Melissa, thought Haventon, as he
returned
to Vincent's.
VOL. II. E 2
The next day Alonzo told the Vincents of
all that had passed, and it was agreed that
Mrs. Vincent should visit at Col.
Bloomfield's
that afternoon: she went at an early
hour. Alonzo's feelings were on the rack
until she returned, which happened much
sooner than was expected, when she gave
the following information:
On arriving there, said she, I found
Melissa's father and mother alone; the latter
was in tears, which she endeavoured to
conceal
;
the former soon withdrew. After some
conversation I inquired for Melissa: Mrs.
Bloomfield burst into tears, and told me
that this morning Melissa's aunt had invited
her to ride out: a carriage was provided,
which, after a large trunk had been placed
therein, drove off with only her and Miss
Martha
;
that Col. Bloomfield had just informed
her that he had sent their daughter to a distant
part of the country, where she was to reside
with a friend until Haventon should depart
from the neighbourhood. The reason of this
sudden resolution was his being apprized by
Bowman, that notwithstanding his
precaution
,
Melissa and Alonzo had an interview
the last evening. Where she was sent to, the
old lady could not tell, but she was convinced
that Melissa was not aware of the design
when she consented to go. Her aunt had
resided
heretofore, alternately, with the
different
relatives of the family, in various parts of
the state, to one of which places they had
probably gone.
Alonzo listened to Mrs. Vincent's relation
with inexpressible agitation. He sat silent a
few moments; then suddenly starting up, I
will find her if she be on the earth! said he,
and in spite of Vincent's attempts to prevent
him, rushed out of the house, flew to the
road, and was soon out of sight.
Melissa had not indeed the most distant
suspicion of the designs of her father and
aunt. The latter said that she was going to
take a morning ride, and invited her niece to
accompany her, to which she consented: she
did not even perceive the trunk which was
fastened on behind the carriage. They were
attended by a single servant, and drove to a
neighbouring town where Melissa had
frequently
been with her father or mother to
purchase articles of dress; there they
alighted
at a friend's house and lingered away the
time until dinner, after which they prepared,
as she supposed, to return, but found to her
surprise when they entered the carriage, that
her aunt ordered the driver to proceed a
different
way. She inquired if they were not
going home. Not yet, said Miss Martha.
Melissa grew uneasy; she expected to see
Mrs. Vincent that afternoon; what
disappointment
must Alonzo experience if he
heard nothing from her! She begged her
aunt to return, as she expected the company
of some ladies that afternoon. You cannot
see them, child, answered the old maid.
Melissa knew it was in vain to remonstrate;
she supposed her aunt was bent on visiting
some of her acquaintance, and remained
silent.
They arrived at another small village and
alighted at an inn, where they tarried while
the servant was ordered out on some business
unknown to Melissa. When they again
seated
themselves in the carriage she perceived
several large packages and bundles which had
been deposited there since they left it. She
inquired of aunt Martha what they
contained
;
Articles for family use, child, she
replied, and ordered the driver to proceed.
They passed along winding and solitary
paths, into a by-road which led through an
unfrequented wood, that opened into a rocky
part of the country, bordering on the Sound.
Here they stopped at the only house in view;
it was a miserable hut built of logs and
covered
with slabs. They alighted from the
carriage
,
and Miss Martha handing the driver a
large bunch of keys; Remember to do as I
have told you, said she, and he drove
rapidly
away. It was with some difficulty they
got into the hut, as a meagre cow with a long
yoke on her neck, a board before her eyes and
a cross-piece on her horns, stood with her
head in the door; on one side of her were
four or five half-starved squeaking pigs; on
the other a flock of gaggling geese. As they
entered the door, a woman who sat carding
wool jumped up: La me! she cried,
here is Madam Bloomfield; welcome here
again: how does Madam do? dropping a
low curtsey. She was dressed in a
linseywoolsey
short gown, a petticoat of the same;
her hair hanging about her ears; bare-headed
and barefoot. Three dirty, ragged children
were playing about the floor, and the furniture
was of a piece with the building.
Is my room in order? inquired Martha.
It hasn't been touched since Madam was
here, answered the woman, and
immediately
stalked away to a little back apartment,
which they entered after her: it was small,
but neatly furnished and contained a single
bed. This appendage had been concealed from
Melissa's view, as it was opposite the side of
the house at which she alighted.
Where is Jeffrey? asked Martha.
My husband is in the garden, replied
the woman; I will call him; and out she
scampered. Jeffrey soon appeared, and
exhibited
an exact counterpart to his wife.
What does Madam please to want?
inquired
he, bowing three or four times.
I want you, Jeffrey, she answered; and
immediately gave some directions in a
whisper
to him and his wife.
Dear, doleful! exclaimed the woman;
Madam a'n't a going to live in that terrible
place. Melissa could not understand her
aunt's reply, but heard her give orders to
first hang on the teakettle. This was
done, when the man and his wife went out,
and Martha prepared tea in her own room.
In about an hour they returned, and gave the
same bunch of keys to Martha which she had
given to the servant who drove the carriage.
Melissa was involved in inscrutable
mystery
respecting these extraordinary
proceedings
;
she conjectured that they boded her no
good, but could not prenetrate into her aunt's
designs: she frequently looked out hoping to
see the return of the carriage, but was
disappointed
.
When tea was made ready she
could neither eat nor drink: after her aunt
had disposed of a dozen cups and an
adequate
proportion of buttered biscuit and
dried beef, she directed Melissa to prepare to
take a walk.
The sun was low; they proceeded through
fields in a foot path, over rough and uneven
ways, directly towards the Sound; they
walked
about a mile, when they came in sight of
a large, old-fashioned, castle-like building,
surrounded
with a moat, crossed by a drawbridge,
and with high, thick, wooden walls; the build
ing was almost totally concealed on all sides
from view, by irregular rows of large locust and
elm trees, dry
Prim

The

formerly a great number of prim hedges in
New-England
and other parts of America. It is a remarkable
fact that they almost all died the year previous to the
commencement of the American war.
hedges and green
shrubbery
.
The gate which opened into the yard
was made of strong hard wood, thickly
crossed
on the outside with iron bars and filled
with old nails and spikes. After passing the
bridge, Melissa's aunt raised it, unlocked the
gate, and they entered the inclosure, which
was overgrown with rank grass and rushes;
the avenue which led to the house was almost
in the same condition. The mansion was
of real Gothic architecture, built of rude
stone with battlements; the doors were
constructed
in the same manner as the gate at
which they entered; they opened one of them,
which creaked heavily on its hinges, and
went in, ascended a flight of stairs, wound
through several dark and empty rooms, till
they came to one which was handsomely
furnished
,
with a fire burning on the hearth;
two beds were in the room, with tables,
chairs and other conveniences for
housekeeping
.
Here we are safe, said Miss Martha,
as I have taken care to lock all the doors and
gates after me. And here, Melissa, you are
in the mansion of your ancestors. Your
great grandfather who came over from
England
built this house in the earliest settlement
of the country, and here he resided until his
death. The reason why the moat, with so
high and thick a wall, were formed around it,
and the doors and gates so strongly fortified,
was to secure it against the Indians, who
frequently
committed depredations on the early
settlers. Your grandfather came into
possession
of this estate after his father's death;
it fell to me by will, with the lands
surrounding
it. The house has sometimes been
tenanted
,
at others not; it has now been vacant
for a few years. The lands are rented
yearly
.
Jeffrey, the person from whose house we
last came, is a servant to one of my overseers
and tenants. I had a small room built
adjoining
that hut, where I generally reside for
a week when I come to receive my rents. I
have thought frequently of fitting up this
place for my future residence, but
circumstances
have hitherto hindered my carrying
the scheme into effect, and now perhaps it
will never take place.
VOL. II. F
Your perverseness, Melissa, in refusing to
comply with the wishes of your friends has
induced us to adopt the plan of bringing you
here, where you are to remain until
Haventon
leaves the neighbourhood of Bloomfield
Vale, at least. Notwithstanding your father's
injunctions and my vigilance, you had a
clandestine
interview with him last night; so we
were told by Bowman this morning, before
he set out for New-London, who discovered
him at your window. It therefore became
necessary to remove you immediately. You
will want for nothing; Jeffrey is to supply us
with every thing that is needful. You will
not be long here; Haventon will soon be
gone; you will think differently; return
home, marry Bowman, and become a lady.
My God! exclaimed Melissa; Is it
possible my father can be so cruel? Is he so
unfeeling as to banish me from his house, and
confine me within the walls of a prison like a
common malefactor! She flung herself on
the bed in a state little inferior to distraction.
Her aunt told her it was all owing to her own
obstinacy, and because she refused to be
made happy, and went to preparing supper.
Melissa heard none of these observations:
she lay in stupifying agony, insensible to all
that passed. When supper was ready her
aunt attempted to arouse her; she started
up, stared around her with a wild and
agonizing
countenance, but spake not a word.
Martha became alarmed; applied stimulants
to her temples and forehead, and persuaded
her to take some cordials; but she remained
seemingly insensible throughout the night;
just at morning she fell into a slumber,
interrupted
by incoherent moanings, convulsive
startings, long sighs, intermitting sobs, and
frequent, sudden and restless turnings from
side to side; at length she appeared to be in a
calm and quiet sleep for nearly an hour.
About
sunrise she awoke; her aunt sat by her
bed-side; she gazed languidly about the
room, then bursting into tears, wept a long
time; Martha endeavoured to console her,
for she really began to tremble lest Melissa's
distress should produce her immediate
dissolution
;
towards night, however, she became
more calm and resigned, but a slight fever
succeeded, which kept her confined for several
days, after which she slowly recovered.
CHAPTER XI.
A thousand phantoms glide the midnight hall,
And groans ascend along the mouldering wall;
Dim shadows flutter through the dreary gloom,
And ghostly voices sound from room to room;
A light appearssome hollow voice is near
Chill terror startsand every pulse is fear.
Linn
.
Jeffrey
came frequently to the mansion
for directions, and provided such things as
they needed. Miss Martha sometimes went
home with him, leaving the keys of the house
with her niece, but locking the gate and
taking the key of that with her. She
generally
returned before sunset.
When Melissa was so far recovered as to
walk out, she found that the house was
situated
on an eminence, about one hundred
perches from the Sound. The yard was large
and extensive; within the inclosure was a
spacious garden, now overrun with brambles
and weeds; some medical and odoriferous
herbs were scattered therein, and a few
solitary
flowers overtopped the tangling briers
below, but there was plenty of fruit on the
shrubbery and trees. The out-buildings were
generally in a ruinous state. The cemetery
was the most perfect, as it was built of
freestone
and marble, and had best withstood the
ravages of time. The rooms in the house
were mostly empty and decaying; the main
building was firm and strong, as was also the
extended wall which inclosed the whole. She
found that although her aunt, when they first
arrived, had led her through several upper
rooms to the chamber she inhabited, yet
there was from thence a direct passage to the
hall. The prospect was not disagreeable:
west, all was wilderness, from a brook which
wound along at a little distance without the
garden wall: north were the uneven grounds
she had crossed when she came there,
bounded
by distant groves and hills: east,
beautiful
meadows and fields, arrayed in flowery
green, sloped to the salt marshes or sandy
banks of the Sound, or ended in the long
white beaches which extended far into the
sea; south was the Sound and Long-Island.
Melissa passed much of her time in tracing
the ruins of this antiquated place; in viewing
VOL. II. F 2
the many different sails as they passed up and
down the Sound, and in listening to the songs
of the numerous and various species of birds
which frequented the garden, the inclosure
and the forest. She would have been
contented
here to bury her afflictions, and for
ever to retire from the world, could Alonzo
but have resided within these walls. What
will he think has become of me, she would
say, while the disconsolate tear of reflection
glittered in her eye. Aunt Martha had
frequently
urged her to yield to her father's
injunctions
,
regain her liberty and marry
Bowman
,
and she every day became more
solicitous
and importunate. A subject so hateful
to Melissa, sometimes provoked her tears, at
others excited her resentment: she therefore,
when the weather was fair, strolled about the
garden, through the adjoining walks, and
around
the inclosure, wishing to be as little in
her aunt's company as possible.
One day Jeffrey came there early in the
morning, and Miss Martha went home with
him. The day passed away but she did not
return. Melissa sat up until a late hour
expecting
her; she then went to the gate and
found it was fast locked, returned, bolted and
fastened the doors of the house, went to bed
and slept as soundly as she had done since
her residence in the old mansion. I have
at least, she said, escaped the disgusting
curtain-lecture about marrying Bowman.
The next day her aunt returned. I was
quite concerned about you, child, said she;
how did you sleep?
Never better, answered Melissa, since
I have been here.
I had forgotten, said Martha, that my
rents became due this week; I was detained
until late by some of my tenants; Jeffrey
was out, and I dare not return in the night
alone. I must go back to-day; it will take
me a week to settle my business; if I am
obliged to stay out again, I will send one of
Jeffrey's daughters to sleep with you.
You need not give yourself that trouble,
replied Melissa; I am under no
apprehension
of staying here alone; nothing can get
in or out of these premises.
Well thou hast wonderful courage, child,
said her aunt; but I will be as often
here as possible, and as soon as my business
is settled I shall be absent no more. She
then bade Melissa good morning and
departed
.
She did not return in two days. The
second
night of her absence Melissa was
sitting
in her chamber, reading, when she heard
a noise, as of several people trampling in the
yard below. She arose, cautiously raised the
window and looked out. It was extremely
dark; she could discern nothing. All was
still, and she thought she must have been
mistaken.
Her aunt came the next day, and told her
she was obliged to go into the country to
collect
some debts of those to whom she had
rented lands. She should be gone a few
days, and when she returned would come
there. The keys of the house, said she,
I will leave with you. The gate I shall
lock, and leave that key with Jeffrey, who
will be here as often as is necessary to assist
you, and see if you want any thing. She
then went off, leaving her niece not
dissatisfied
with the prospect of her absence.
Melissa amused herself on evenings by
reading in the few books her aunt had
brought there, and in the day-time by walking
around the yard and garden, or in traversing
the rooms of this antique building. In some,
were the remains of ancient furniture, others
were entirely empty. Cobwebs and
mouldering
walls were the principal ornaments left.
One evening, when about retiring to rest,
she thought she heard the same trampling
noises in the yard, as on a former occasion.
She stepped softly to the window, suddenly
raised it, and holding out the candle, she
fancied
she saw the glance of two or three dark
forms pass swiftly along, but so indistinctly
that it was impossible to determine whether
they were real, or only shadows produced by
objects intervening the light of the candle.
She listened and gazed with anxious
solicitude
,
but discovered nothing more; then shut
the window, and in a short time went to bed.
But for a length of time she could not
sleep. She had been alarmed by
appearances
,
either real or imaginary; probably the
latter, but possibly the former, and if so, how
distressing her situation! Secluded in a
desolate
building, insolated, far removed from
society, beyond the reach of assistance,
whatever
dangers might arise, whatever evils
should threaten. She might even be
murdered
there, without the perpetrators fearing
punishment or discovery.
But on calmer reflection, she felt confident
that no human being could enter the premises.
The canal, the wall, the drawbridge, the gate,
the building, were all originally constructed
to resist the ravages of war, the attacks of the
natives. When therefore the drawbridge was
drawn up, and the gate effectually secured, as
they then were, they could not be surpassed
even by the wild beasts of the forest.
Nothing
except the winged inhabitants of
air could gain access to the inclosure, and
they were harmless.
Composed by these considerations, she
finally
fell asleep; but was aroused to instant
wakefulness, at what time, or by what
cause, she knew not. She listened, and
thought she could distinguish a low hum of
voices, but in what direction she could not
ascertain. The noise soon ceased, but she
slept no more.
Perceiving the next day that nothing had
been displaced about the house or grounds,
she concluded that her senses must have
deceived
her; or if the noises were real, they
might have proceeded from the sailors of
some vessel passing the Sound.
A few evenings after, as she was
preparing
for bed, she was startled by what
seemed
the quick shutting of a door. With
breathless attention she listened for some
time, but heard nothing more. She then took
the candle, went down stairs, and searched
the rooms; but discovering no circumstance
which could explain the cause of the alarm,
she supposed it must have been effected by
rats, which frequented the old building.
With these impressions she returned to her
chamber, and retired to repose.
Some time in the night she was awakened
by a sharp sound, apparently near her. She
started in trembling panic; but
endeavoured
to compose herself with the idea that
something had fallen from the shelves. While
reflecting upon the incident, she plainly
distinguished
footsteps and voices in the rooms
below. She shuddered; a cold chilly sweat
ran down her face. Directly after, she was
convinced that she heard whispering in her
room. She raised herself up in the bed, and
cast inquisitive eyes towards her chamber
door. All was darkness; no object was
visible
;
no noise assailed her ear, and she again
lay down.
Her mind was too much agitated and
alarmed
to admit sleep. She had evidently heard
sounds, footsteps and voices in the house, and
whisperings which appeared to be in her
room. The yard gate was locked, of which
Jeffrey had the key: she was confident that no
person could ascend or get over the wall of the
inclosure; but if that were practicable, how
was it possible that any human being could
enter
the house! she possessed the key of every
door, and they were all fast locked. A thought
darted into her mindwas it not a plan which
her aunt had contrived in order to frighten her
into a compliance with the wishes of her
father
?
But how could the house be entered
without keys? This might be done with
false ones. But from whence did the
whispering
proceed, which appeared close to her
bed-side? Possibly it might be conveyed
through the key-hole of her chamber door.
These thoughts tended in some degree to
allay
her fears; they were possibilities at least,
however improbable.
As she was thus musing, a hand, cold as the
icy fingers of death, grasped her arm, which
lay on the outside of the bed-clothes. She
screamed convulsively, and sprang up in the
bed. Nothing was to be seen, no noise
distinguished
.
She had not time to reflect.
She flew out of bed, ran to the fire and
lighted a candle. Her heart beat rapidly.
She cast timid glances around the room;
cautiously
searching every corner, and
examining
the door. All things were in the same
state she had left them when she went to
rest. Her door was locked in the same
manner
.
No visible being was in the room
except
herself.
She sat down contemplating on these
strange events. Was it not probable that she
was right in her first conjectures respecting
their being the works of her aunt, and
effected
VOL. II. G
by her agents and their instrumentality?
All was possible except the cold hand which
had grasped her arm. Might not this be the
delusion of a terrified and heated imagination?
Or if by false keys the rooms had been entered
below, might they not also be used to enter
her chamber? But could the door of her
room be unlocked, a person come in, approach
her bed, depart, and relock the door, while she
was awake, in so noiseless and silent a manner?
All inclination for sleep had deserted her;
she therefore determined not again to attempt
it that night. She took up a book, but her
spirits had been too much agitated by the past
scenes to permit her to read. She looked out
of the window: the moon was up, and cast a
pale, imperfect lustre over the landscape.
She reflected upon the sounds she had heard
in the lower rooms; perhaps the doors were
open; the thought was alarming. She
unclosed
her chamber door, and with the candle
in her hand cautiously descended the stairs,
casting an inquisitive eye in every direction,
and stopping frequently to listen. She
advanced
to the door; it was locked;
examined
the others, they were in the same
situation
.
She turned to go up stairs, when a
loud whisper echoed through the hall,
expressing
away! away!
She flew swiftly to her
chamber, relocked the door, and flung
herself
almost breathless into a chair.
When her scattered senses were collected,
she concluded that whoever had been in the
house were there still. She resolved to go out
no more until day, which, from an eastern
window
,
she soon perceived beginning to
discolour
the east with a fainter blue; then purple
streaks, intermingled with a dusky whiteness,
ascended in pyramidal columns to the zenith;
these fading slowly away, the eastern horizon
became fringed with the golden spangles of
early morning; a small spot of ineffable
brightness succeeded, and immediately the
sun burst over the verge of creation, deluging
the world in a flood of unbounded light and
glory.
Soon as the morning had a little advanced
Melissa ventured out. She proceeded with
hesitating steps, carefully scrutinizing each
object which met her sight. She examined
all the doors; they were still fast; critically
searched every room, closet, and corner,
above
and below. She next took a light and
descended into the cellar; here her
inquisition
was the same. Thus did she thoroughly
and strictly explore and search every part of
the house, but could find nothing altered,
changed or removed; no outlet, no signs of
any being having been there the
evening
before, except herself. She then
unclosed
the outer door and proceeded to the
gate, which she found locked as usual. She
next examined the yard, the garden and all
the outhouses; nothing could be discovered
of any person having been recently there. She
walked around by the wall, the whole circle
of the inclosure; she was convinced that the
unusual height thereof rendered it impossible
for any one to get over it. It was
constructed
of several tier of hewn timbers, and both
sides of it were smooth as glass. On the
top long spikes were thickly driven in,
sharpened
at both ends. It was surrounded on
the outside by a deep, wide moat, which was
nearly filled with water. Over this moat,
outside of the gate, was a drawbridge, which
was raised, and Jeffrey had the keys of both the
bridge and the gate. The events of the past
night, therefore, remained inscrutable, unless,
as she conjectured, her aunt was the agent
who had managed this extraordinary
machinery
.
She found Jeffrey at the house when she
re-entered. Does madam want any thing
to day? asked he.
Has my aunt returned? inquired
Melissa
.
Not yet, he replied.
How long has she been gone? she
asked
.
Four days, replied Jeffrey, after
counting
his fingers, and she will not be back
under
four or five more.
Has the key of the gate been constantly
in your possession? inquired she.
The keys of the gate and drawbridge, he
replied, have not been out of my possession
for a moment since Madam has been gone.
VOL. II. G 2
Has any person been to inquire for me or
my aunt, she asked, since I have been
here?
No, Madam, he answered, not a
single
person.
Melissa knew not what to think: she could
not give up the idea of false keys: probably,
by the contrivance of her father and aunt,
the drawbridge had been let down, the
gate opened and the house entered by means
of such keys. Her father would as soon do
this as to confine her in so solitary a place,
nor would he abandon his purpose, if by any
measures he could induce her to relinquish
Alonzo and marry Bowman.
An idea impressed her mind which gave
her some consolation; it was possible to
secure
the premises so that no one could enter
even by the aid of false keys. She asked
Jeffrey if he would assist her that day. In
any thing you wish, Madam, he replied.
She then directed him to go to work: old
staples and iron bars were found in different
parts of the building, with which he secured
the doors and windows, so that they could be
opened only on the inside; the gate, which
swang inward, was secured in the same
manner
.
She then asked him if he was willing
to leave the keys of the gate and the
draw-bridge
with her. Perhaps I may as well,
said he, for if you bar the gate and
drawup
the bridge, I cannot get in myself until
you please to let me, and handed her the
keys. When I come, said he, I will
holla, and you must let me in. This she
promised to do, and Jeffrey departed.
[2]
[2]
Of the place where Melissa was confined, as
described
in the foregoing pages, scarce a trace now
remains. By the events of the revolution the premises
fell into other hands. The mansion, outhouses and
walls were torn down; the cemetery levelled, the
moat filled up, the locust and elm trees cleared away;
all obstructions were removed, and the yard and
garden
converted into a beautiful meadow. An elegant
farm-house is now erected on the place where
Jeffrey's
hut then stood, and the neighbourhood is thinly
settled.
That night Melissa raised the bridge,
locked
and barred the gate, as also the doors and
windows of the house; she likewise went again
over all parts of the building, strictly
searching
every place, though well convinced from
previous scrutiny that nothing extraordinary
would be discovered; she then retired to her
chamber, seated herself at a western window
and watched the slow declining sun as it
leisurely
sank behind lofty groves. Pensive
twilight
spread her dusky mantle over the
landscape
;
the western horizon glowed with the
spangles of evening; deepening glooms
advanced
;
the last beam of day faded, and the
world was enveloped in night. The owl
hooted
solemnly in the forest, and the whipperwill
sung cheerfully in the garden. Innumerous
stars glittered in the firmament,
intermingling
their quivering lustre with the pale
splendours of the milky-way.
She did not retire from the window until
late; then shut it and withdrew to her room,
intending not to close her eyes during the
night; if beings material or immaterial were
to visit her, she chose not again to encounter
them in darkness, or to be surprised by them
when asleep. But what cause existed for
fear? She had injured no one; none had she
displeased, except her father, her aunt and
Bowman; if by any of these the late
terrifying
scenes had been wrought, they were
effectually
precluded from repeating them, for
she was well convinced that no human being
could now enter the inclosure without her
permission; but if supernatural agents were
the actors, what had she to apprehend from
them? The night passed away without any
alarming circumstance, and when daylight
appeared she flung herself upon the bed and
slept until the morning was considerably
advanced
.
She now felt convinced that her
former
conjectures were right; that it was her
aunt, her father, or both, who had caused
the frightful noises she had heard, a
repetition
of which were only prevented by the
precautions she had taken.
When she awoke the horizon was
overclouded
;
it soon began to rain and
continued
until towards evening, when it cleared
away. She went to the gate, and found all
things as she had left them, then returned,
fastened the doors as usual, examined all
parts of the house, and again went to her
chamber.
She sat up until a late hour, when growing
very drowsy, and convinced that she was safe
and secure, concluded to retire to repose,
leaving candles, however, burning in the
room. Having for two nights been deprived
of her usual rest, she soon fell into a slumber.
Sleep had scarcely arrested her senses,
when she was instantly aroused by the
apparent
report of a pistol, seemingly discharged
close to her head. Awakened so
suddenly
,
recollection for a time was confused
and imperfect; she was only sensible of a
strong, sulphureous scent; but she soon
remembered
leaving two candles burning, and
every object was now shrouded in darkness:
this alarmed her exceedingly. What could
have become of the candles? They must
have been extinguished or taken away. What
was the noise she had just heard? What
the sulphureous stench which pervaded the
room? While thus reflecting in perplexity, a
broad flash like that of lightning transiently
illuminated her chamber, followed by a long,
loud and deep roar which seemed to shake
the building to its centre; it did not appear
like thunder; the sound was apparently in
the rooms directly over her head: perhaps
however it was thunder; possibly a
preceding
clap had struck near the building,
broken the windows, put out the lights, and
filled the house with the electric effluvium.
She listened for a repetition of the report;
but a very different sound soon grated on her
ear: a hollow, horrible groan echoed through
her apartment, passing off in a faint, dying
murmur: it was evident that the groan
proceeded
from some person in the chamber.
Melissa raised her head; a tall, white form
moved from the upper end of the room,
glided slowly by her bed and seemed to pass
off near the foot; she then heard the doors
below alternately open and shut, slapping
furiously
and in quick succession, followed by
violent noises in the rooms beneath, like the
falling of heavy bodies, and the crash of
furniture
;
clamorous voices succeeded, among
which she could distinguish boisterous
menaces
and threatenings, and the plaintive tone
of expostulation; a momentary silence
ensued
,
when the cry of
Murder! murder!
murder!
echoed through the building,
followed
by the report of a pistol, and shortly
after
by the groans of a person apparently in the
agonies of death, which grew fainter and
fainter until they died away in a seemingly
expiring gasp: a dead silence prevailed for a
few minutes, to which a loud, hoarse peal
of ghastly laughter succeeded; then again
all was still: but she soon heard heavy
footsteps
ascending the stairs to her chamber
door. It was then she became terrified and
alarmed beyond any former example.
Gracious
Heaven defend me, she exclaimed;
what am I coming to! Knowing that
every
avenue to the inclosure was effectually
secured; that all the doors and windows of
the house, as also the door which opened into
her chamber, were fast locked, strictly bolted
and barred, and certain that all the keys were
in her possession, she could not entertain the
least doubt but the noises she had heard were
produced by supernatural beings, and she had
reason to believe, of the most mischievous
nature. She was now convinced that neither
her father nor her aunt could have any agency
in the business, and even wished her aunt
had returned. It must be exceedingly difficult
to cross the moat, as the drawbridge was up;
it must be still more difficult to scale the wall
of the inclosure; it was impossible for any
human being to get into the house, or to enter
her chamber, without bursting the doors.
While she lay thus ruminating in extreme
agitation, momentarily expecting her ears
would be assailed with some terrific sound,
a pale light dimly illuminated her room; it
grew brighter; she raised herself up to look
towards the door; the first sight which met
her eye was a most horrible object
standing
at a little distance from her bed-side; its
form was tall and stately, wrapped in a white,
folding robe, spotted with blood; the hair
of its head was matted with clotted gore;
a deep wound appeared to have pierced
the breast, from which fresh blood flowed
down the garment; its haggard face was
gashed and gory; eyes fixed, glazed and
glaring
;
lips open, teeth set, and in its hand was
a bloody dagger. Melissa, uttering a shriek
of terror, shrunk into bed, and in an instant
the room was involved in total darkness; a
freezing ague seized her limbs, and drops of
chilling sweat stood upon her face.
Immediately
a horrid, hoarse voice burst from
amidst
the gloom of her apartment
Begone!
Begone from this house!
The bed on which
she lay then seemed to be agitated, and
directly
she perceived some person crawling on
to its foot. Every consideration except
present
safety was relinquished; instantaneously
she sprang from the bed to the floor, with
convulsive grasp seized the candle, flew to
the fire and lighted it; she gazed wildly
about
the room; no new object was visible;
with timid step she approached the bed,
strictly
searched all around and under it, but
nothing
strange could be found. An idea
flashed
across her mind to leave the house
immediately
and fly to Jeffrey's; this was easy,
VOL. II. H
as the keys of the gate and drawbridge were
in her possession; she stopped not to
reconsider
the thought, but seizing the keys,
with a candle in her hand, unlocked her
chamber door, and proceeded cautiously
down stairs, fearfully casting her eyes on each
side as she tremblingly advanced to the outer
door. She hesitated a moment: to what
perils was she about to expose herself by thus
venturing out at the dead of night and
proceeding
such a distance alone! But confident
her situation could become no more
hazardous
,
she was about to unbar the door, when
she was alarmed by a deep, hollow sigh; she
looked around, and saw stretched on one side
of the hall the same ghastly form which had
so recently appeared standing by her
bedside
;
the same haggard countenance, the
same awful appearance of murderous death!
A faintness came upon her; she turned to flee
to her chamber; the candle dropped from
her palsied hand and all was shrouded in
impenetrable darkness. Groping to find the
stairs, as she came near their foot, a black
object
,
apparently in human shape, stood before
her, with eyes which resembled glowing
coals, and red flames issuing from its mouth.
As she stood fixed in inexpressible
trepidation
,
a large ball of fire rolled slowly along the
extended hall, and burst with an explosion
which seemed to rock the building to its
deepest foundations. Melissa closed her eyes
and fell senseless to the floor: she revived,
and reached her chamber she hardly knew
how; locked her door, lighted another
candle
,
and after again searching the room sank
into a chair in a state of mind which almost
deprived her of reason.
Daylight soon appeared; and the cheerful
sun, darting his enlivening rays through the
crevices and windows of the antique
mansion
,
revived her exhausted spirits, and
dissipated
in some degree the terrors which
hovered
about her mind. She endeavoured
to reason coolly on the events of the
past night, but reason could not elucidate
them; not the least sound had been heard
since she returned to her room; she
therefore expected to discover no traits which
might tend to a disclosure of those mysteries.
She consoled herself only with a fixed
determination
to leave the desolate building.
Should Jeffrey come there that day, he might
be prevailed on to permit her to remain at
the apartment in his house until her aunt
returned. If he came not before sunset, she
resolved to leave the mansion and proceed
thither.
After taking some refreshment she went
down stairs; the doors and windows were all
fast as she had left them; she again
searched every room in the house, both
above
and below, but discovered no trace
or mark of the past disturbance; not
the smallest article was displaced; every
thing appeared as usual. She then went to
the gate; it was locked and the drawbridge
was up. Again she traversed the circuit of
the wall, but found no alteration, or any
place where it was possible the inclosure
might be entered; she visited the
outbuildings
,
and even entered the cemetery, but
perceived
not the least trait or vestige which
tended to explain the surprising transactions
of the preceding night. She however
returned
to her room in a more composed frame
of spirit, confident that she should not
remain
alone another night in that gloomy,
desolate
and dangerous solitude.
Towards evening Melissa took her usual
walk around the inclosure. It was that sea
son of the year when weary summer is lapsing
into the arms of sallow autumn. The day
had been warm, and the light gales bore
revigorating
coolness on their wings, as they
tremulously agitated the foliage of the
western
forest, or fluttered among the branches
of trees surrounding the mansion. The green
splendours of spring had begun to fade into a
yellow lustre; the flowery verdure of the
fields was changing to a russet hue. A robin
chirped on a neighbouring oak, a wren
chattered
beneath; swallows twittered around
the decayed buildings; the ludicrous
mocking-bird
sang sportively from the top of the
highest elm, and the surrounding groves rang

while deep in the adjacent wilderness
the woodcock,
[3]
[3]
This bird is of the same plumage, possessing the
same habits and propensities, and is doubtless of the
same species with the common woodpecker, but much
larger, weighing from four to six pounds. It has a
long, sharp and strong beak, with which it readily chops
large holes and cavities into dry and decaying trees, in
order to extract worms and insects, which it devours.
It has been known to cut a dry branch of considerable
dimensions entirely off in a very short time; and while
it is thus employed the chips and fragments fly from
the wood as by the stroke of a hatchet. If the tree or
branch happens to be hollow, the sound is heard at a
great distance. It is common in the eastern states,
where it is called the woodcock. Its note or call is
singular, loud and strong. There is another species of
bird in this country known by the same name.
hammering on the hollow
trunk of some dry and blasted tree, filled
VOL. II. H 2
the woods with reverberant echoes. The
Sound was only ruffled by the lingering
breezes as they idly wandered over its
surface
.
Long-Island, then in possession of the
British troops, was thinly enveloped in smoky
vapour: scattered along its shores lay the
numerous small craft and larger ships of the
hostile fleet. A few skiffs were passing and
repassing the Sound, and several American
gun-boats lay off a point which stretched out
from the mainland far to the eastward.
Numberless
summer insects mingled their
discordant
strains amidst the weedy herbage. A
heavy, black cloud was rising in the
northwest
which seemed to portend a shower, as
the sonorous, distant thunder was at long
intervals
distinctly heard.
Melissa strolled around the inclosure,
contemplating the varying beauties of the
scene. The images of departed joys, the
days when Alonzo had participated with her
in admiring the splendours of rural prospects,
raised in her bosom the sigh of deep regret.
Where was he now? What were his
sensations
?
Perhaps he had been induced to
believe
her false or capricious; or wearied by
incessant disappointment, he might have
relinquished
a pursuit attended with so much
difficulty: or was it not more probable that
his late family misfortunes, added to the
mystery
of her sudden disappearance, had driven
him to despair, and that he was now
wandering
in distant lands? Could she but hear
from him, it might alleviate her sorrows; but
alas! she doubted of ever hearing aught that
would restore her to comfort and to peace.
She entered the garden and traversed the
alleys, now overgrown with weeds and tufted
knot-grass. The flower-beds were choaked
with the low-running bramble and the
tangling
five-finger; tall, rank rushes, mullens
and daisies had usurped the empire of the
kitchen garden. The
viny arbour
was broken
and principally gone to decay; yet the
lonely
wild-rose blushed mournfully amidst its
ruins, and around the environs the wild grape
hung in clusters. Passing from the garden,
she involuntarily stopped at the cemetery;
she paused in serious reflection: Here,
said she, in this house of gloom, rest in
undisturbed
silence my honourable ancestors,
once the active tenants of yonder mansion;
then, throughout these now solitary demesnes,
the busy occurrences of life glided in
cheerful
circles; then, these moss-clad alleys and
this wild, weedy garden, were the resort of
the fashionable and the gay; evening music
then floated over the fields, while yonder halls
and apartments shone with brilliant
illumination
:
now all is sad, solitary and dreary, the
haunt of sprites and spectres of nameless
terror. All that remains of the head that
formed, the hand that executed and the
bosom
that relished this once happy scenery, is,
alas! only a heap of dust.
She seated herself on a little hillock under
a weeping-willow that stood near the
cemetery
,
and watched the rising shower which
slowly ascended in gloomy pomp, half hidden
behind western groves, shrouding the low
sun in black vapour, while coming thunders
nearer and more awfully rolled. The shriek
ing night-hawk

peculiarity

soared high into the air,
mingling
with the lurid van of the approaching
storm, which widening, more rapidly
advanced
,
until the heavens were arrayed in
blackness. The lightning broader and
brighter flashed, hurling down its forky,
streaming bolts, far in the wilderness, its
flaming path followed by the volleying
artillery
of the skies; now bending its long,
crinkling spires over the valleys, then
glimmering
along the summit of the hills.
Convolving
clouds poured smoky volumes through
the expansion; a deep, hollow, distant roar
announced the approach of summoned
winds; the whole forest bowed in awful
grandeur, as from its dark bosom rushed the
impetuous hurricane, twisting off or tearing
up by the roots the stoutest trees, and
whirling
the heaviest branches through the air with
irresistible fury. It dashed upon the sea,
tossed it into irregular mountains, or mingled
its white, foamy spray with the gloom of the
turbid skies. Slantways the large, heavy
drops of rain began to descend. Melissa
hastened to the mansion; as she reached the
door a very brilliant flash of lightning,
accompanied
by a tremendous explosion,
startled
her. A thunderbolt had entered a large
elm tree within the inclosure, and with
horrible
crash had shivered it from top to bottom.
She unlocked the door and hurried to her
chamber.
Deep night now filled the atmosphere; the
rain poured in torrents; the wind rocked the
building and bellowed in the adjacent groves;
the sea raged and roared; fierce lightnings
rent the heavens, alternately involving the
world in the sheeted flame of their
many-coloured
fires; thunders rolled awfully
around
the firmament, or burst with horrid din,
bounding and reverberating among the
surrounding
woods, hills and valleys. It
seemed
nothing less than the crush of worlds
sounding through the universe.
Melissa walked her room, listening to the
wild commotion of the elements. She feared
that if the storm continued she should be
compelled to pass another night in the lonely
mansion; if so, she resolved not to sleep.
She now suddenly recollected that in her
haste to regain her chamber she had
forgotten
to lock the outer door; the shock she
received when the lightning demolished the
elm tree was the cause of this neglect; she
took the candle, ran hastily down and
fastened
the door. When returning, she heard
footsteps, and imperfectly saw the glance of
something coming out of an adjoining room
into the hall; supposing some ghastly object
was approaching, she averted her eyes and
flew to the stairs: as she was ascending them
a voice behind her expressed, Gracious
Heaven!Melissa! The voice agitated her
frame with a confused, sympathetic
sensation
.
She turned, fixed her eyes upon the
person who had spoken; unconnected ideas
floated a moment in her imagination
Eternal
Powers! she exclaimedAlonzo!
CHAPTER XII.
Sleep, lovely maid! In hallowed silence rest,
Let fragrant gales thy form with leaves invest;
There, with new sweets, the lonely wild-rose bloom,
And pitying strangers raise thy verdant tomb.

They
were both equally surprised at so
unexpected a meeting, and could scarcely
credit their own senses. How Alonzo
discovered
her solitude; what led him to that
lonely place; how he crossed the canal and
scaled the wall, were queries which first arose
in the mind of Melissa. He likewise could
not conceive by what miracle he should find
her in a remote, desolate building, which he
had supposed uninhabited. With rapture he
took her trembling hand; tears of joy choked
their utterance.
You are wet, Alonzo, said Melissa, at
length; we will go up to my chamber, I
have a fire there, where you can dry your
clothes.
Your chamber! replied he; who then
inhabits this house?
No one except myself, she answered;
I am here alone.
Alone! he exclaimed; Here alone,
Melissa! Good God! Tell me howwhy
by what means are you here alone?
Let us go to my room, she answered;
and I will tell you all. He followed to
her apartment and seated himself by the fire.
You want refreshment, said she, which
was indeed the case, as he had been long
without
any, and was wet, hungry and weary.
She immediately began to prepare supper
and soon had it ready, when a comfortable
repast was spread for his entertainment.
And now, reader, if thou art a child of
nature; if thy bosom be susceptible of refined
sensibility, contemplate for a moment,
Melissa
and Alonzo seated at the same table, a
table
prepared by her own hands, in a lonely
mansion, distant from society, and no one
present
to interrupt them. After innumerable
VOL. II. I
difficulties, troubles and perplexities; after
serious
embarrassments and a painful separation,
they were once more together, and for some time
every other consideration was lost. the
violence
of the storm had not abated; the
lightning
still blazed, the thunder bellowed, the
wind roared, the sea raged, the rain poured,
mingled with rattling hail. They heard little
of it. She told him all that had happened to
her since they parted, except of the strange
noises and awful sights which had terrified
her during her confinement in that solitary
building; this she considered unnecessary
and untimely in their present situation.
Alonzo informed her that soon as he
learned
the manner in which she had been sent
away, he left the house of Vincent and
repaired
to her father's, to see if he could not
find out by some of the domestics where she
was concealed. None of them knew any
thing about it. He did not put himself in
the way of her father, as he was
apprehensive
of ill treatment. He then went to
several
places among the relatives of the family,
where he had heretofore visited with Melissa,
most of whom treated him with a cautious
coldness. At length he came to the house of
Bergher; there he was received with the
ardour
of friendship. They had heard his
story
;
Melissa had kept up a correspondence
with Mrs. Bergher and Katherine; they were
therefore apprized of all, except Melissa's
removal from her father's house; of this
they knew nothing until informed thereof by
Haventon.
I am surprised at the conduct of my
kinsman
,
said Bergher; for though his
injunctions
are like the laws of the Medes and
Persians, yet I have ever believed that the
welfare of his children lay nearest his heart.
In the present instance he is certainly
pursuing
a mistaken course. I will visit him;
possibly
he may be induced to adopt milder
measures. He then ordered his horse,
desiring
Haventon to remain at his house until
he made the experiment.
Alonzo was entertained with the most
friendly politeness by the family; he found
that they were deeply interested in his favour
and the welfare of Melissa. Here for the
first time he saw and became acquainted with
the Baron Du Ruyter, and was highly pleased
with his manners. Du Ruyter, instead of
returning to Germany, fired with the flame
of patriotism, espoused the American cause,
had been honoured with the station of
general
of brigade, and was soon to repair to the
army.
The ensuing evening Bergher returned.
It is in vain, said he, to reason with my
kinsman: he is determined that his daughter
shall marry your rival. He will not even
inform
me to what place he has sent her; his
sister however is with her, and they must be
at the residence of some of their connexions.
I will dispatch my son Roderick among them,
perhaps he will be able to make some
discovery
.
The next morning Roderick
departed
,
and was gone five days, but could not
obtain the least intelligence either of Melissa
or her aunt, although he had visited almost
all the relatives of the family.
There is some mystery in this affair,
said Bergher. I am very little acquainted
with Miss Martha; I have understood that
she derives a decent support from her
patrimonial
resources, which it is said are pretty
large, and that she resides alternately with
her different relations. I have also been
informed
that my kinsman expects her fortune
to come into his family in case she never
marries
,
which in all probability she now will
not, and that she in consequence holds
considerable
influence over him. Doubtless his
daughter is concealed at some place where
her aunt usually resides. I judge it cannot
be long before the secret is disclosed. You,
Mr. Haventon, are welcome to make my
house your home; and if the object of your
search can be found, she shall be treated as
my daughter. Alonzo thanked him for his
friendship and proffered kindness: I must
continue, said he, my inquiries for
Melissa
;
the result you shall know.
He then departed, and travelled through the
neighbouring villages and adjoining towns,
making
at almost every house such examination
as he considered necessary on the occasion.
He at length arrived at the inn in the last little
village where Melissa and her aunt had
stopped
when they went to the mansion. Here
the innkeeper informed him that two ladies
answering to his description had been at his
house; he named the time, which was the
day on which they left Bloomfield Vale. The
innkeeper told him that they purchased some
VOL. II. I 2
articles in the village, and drove off to the
south. Alonzo then traversed the country
adjoining the Sound, far to the west, and
was returning eastward, when he was
overtaken
by the shower. No house being within
sight, he resorted to the forest for shelter;
from a little hilly glade in the wilderness he
discovered the lonely mansion, which from
its appearance he very naturally judged to
be uninhabited. The tempest soon becoming
severe, he thought he would endeavour to
reach the house; when he arrived at the moat
he found it impossible to cross it, or ascend
the wall; and he stood in momentary
jeopardy
of his life from the falling timber, some
of which was broken or torn up by the
tornado
,
some splintered by the fiery bolts of
heaven. At length a large, tall tree, which
stood near him on the verge of the canal,
was hurled from its foundation, and fell with
hideous crash across the moat, its top lodging
on the wall; he scrambled up on the trunk,
and advanced along on the fallen tree; by
the incessant glare of lightning he was able
to see distinctly; the top of the tree was
partly broken by the force of the fall, and
hung over the inclosure; by these branches
he let himself down into the yard, proceeded
to the house, found the door open, which
Melissa
had left so in her fright, and entered into
one of the rooms, where he proposed to stay
until at least the storm was over, still
supposing
the house unoccupied, until the noise of
locking the door, and the light of the candle,
drew him from the room, when to his infinite
surprise he discovered Miss Bloomfield, as
previously related.
Melissa listened to this narrative with
varied
emotion. The fixed obduracy of her
father, the generous conduct of the Berghers,
the constancy of Alonzo, filled her heart with
inexpressible sensations. She foresaw that
her sufferings were not shortly to end. She
knew not when her sorrows would close.
Haventon was shocked at the alteration
which appeared in the features of Melissa.
The rose had faded from her cheek, except
when transiently suffused with a hectic
flush. A livid paleness sat upon her
countenance
,
and her fine form was rapidly wasting.
It was easy to foresee that the floods of grief
which overwhelmed her, unless shortly
removed
,
would soon sink her to the tomb.
The storm had now passed into the regions
of the east; the wind and rain had ceased,
the lightning more unfrequently flashed, and
the thunder rolled at a distance. The hours
moved hastily; day would soon appear.
Hitherto
they had thought only of the present
moment; it was time to think of the future.
After the troubles they had experienced,
after
so fortunate a meeting, they could not
endure
the idea of another and an immediate
separation; and yet immediately separate
they must. It would not be safe for Alonzo
to stay there even until the rising of the sun,
unless he was concealed; and of what use
could it be for him to remain there in
concealment
?
In this dilemma there was but one
expedient
.
Permit me, said Alonzo, to
remove
you from this solitary confinement.
Your health is impaired. To you your father
is no longer a parent; he has steeled his
bosom
to paternal affection; he has banished
you from his house, placed you under the
tyranny of others, and confined you in a
lonely
,
desolate building, far from the sweets of
society, and this only because you cannot
heedlessly renounce a most solemn contract,
formed under his eye and sanctioned by his
immediate approbation. Pardon me,
Melissa
,
I would not wish unjustly to censure your
father, but allow me to say, that after such
treatment you are absolved from implicit
obedience
to his rigorous, cruel and stern
commands
.
It will therefore be considered a
duty you owe to your preservation, if you
suffer me to remove you from the unusual
severity
with which you are oppressed.
Melissa sighed, and wiping a tear which
fell from her eye: Unqualified obedience to
my parents, said she, I ever considered
the first of duties, and have religiously
practised
thereon. But where, Alonzo, would
you remove me?
To any place you shall appoint, he
answered
.
Alas! I have nowhere to go, she replied.
If you will permit me to name the place,
said he, I will mention Bergher's: he will
espouse your cause, and if conciliation be
possible, will reconcile you to your father.
You are intimate with the family, and are
distantly connected. They are all your
friends, and sincerely sympathize in your
sufferings. It was their express desire, if
you could be found, to have you brought to
their house. Your removal can be effected
without its being known that I had any
agency
in the business. There you can remain
either in secret or openly, as you shall choose,
until some change in our affairs takes place.
Be governed by me in this, and in all things
I will obey you thereafter. I will then
submit
to the future events of fate; but I
cannot
,
Melissa, I cannot leave you in this
doleful
place.
Melissa arose and walked the room in
extreme
agitation. What did her duty enjoin?
She had indeed determined to quit the house
for reasons of which Alonzo knew nothing.
But should she leave it in the way
previously
contemplated, she would probably be
immediately remanded back, more strictly
guarded, and more severely treated. To
continue
there under existing circumstances,
would be impossible, and long to exist. She
therefore came to a determinationI will
go, she said, to Bergher's.
It was then concluded that Alonzo should
proceed to the house of Vincent, apprize that
family of the circumstances, procure a carriage
and return at eleven o'clock the next night.
Melissa was to leave the drawbridge down
and the gate open. If Jeffrey should come to
the house the succeeding day, she would
persuade
him to let her still keep the keys. But
it was possible her aunt might return: this
would render the execution of the scheme more
hazardous and difficult: a signal was therefore
agreed on; if Martha should be there, a
candle
was to be set at the window fronting the gate,
in the chamber; if not, it would be placed
against
a similar window in the room below. In
the first case, Haventon was to rap loudly at the
door, Melissa would then run down under
pretence
of seeing who was there, fly with Alonzo
to the carriage, and leave her aunt to scrape
acquaintance
with the ghosts and goblins of the
old mansion. For even if Martha should
return
,
which was extremely doubtful, Melissa
thought she could contrive to let down the
bridge and unlock the gate in the evening,
without her aunt's knowledge. At any rate,
she was determined not to let the keys go out
of her hands, unless they were forced from
her, until she had escaped from that horrid
and dreary place. Had Alonzo been
apprized
of the terrors she had there
encountered
,
what would have been his sensations!
but these she wisely concealed.
Daylight began to break from the east, and
Haventon prepared to depart. Melissa
accompanied
him to the bridge, which they let
down; he passed over, and she slowly
withdrew
,
both frequently turning to look back.
At the gate she paused; Alonzo stopped also;
she waved a white handkerchief, and he
bowed
in answer to the sign. She then leisurely
entered and slowly closed the gate. Alonzo
could not forbear climbing up into a tree to
catch another glance of her as she passed up
the avenue. With lingering step he saw her
move along, soon receding from his view in
the grey twilight of a misty morning. He
then descended and hastily proceeded on his
journey.
Streams of glory now painted the eastern
skies. The glittering day-star, harbinger of
light, began to transmit its retrocessive lustre.
Thin scud flew swiftly over the moon's
decrescent
form. Low, hollow winds
murmured
among the bushes, or brushed the limpid
drops from intermingling foliage. The
firefly
sank, feebly twinkling, amidst the weedy
herbage of the fields. The dusky shadows
of night fled to the deep glens and rocky
caverns
of the wilderness. The American lark
soared high in the air, consecrating its matin
lay to morn's approaching splendours. The
woodlands began to ring with native melody.
Forest tops, on high mountains, caught the
sun's first ray, which widening and extending,
soon spangled the landscape with brilliants of
a thousand various dies.
As Haventon came out of the fields near
the road, he saw two persons passing in an
open chaise; they suddenly stopped, earnestly
gazing at him: they were wrapped in long
riding-cloaks, and it could not be
distinguished
from their dress whether they were men
or women. He stood not to notice them, but
made the best of his way to the residence of
the Vincents, where he arrived about noon.
Rejoiced to find that he had discovered
Melissa
,
they applauded the plan of her removal
and assisted him in obtaining a carriage.
A chaise was procured, and he set out to
return
,
promising to see Vincent again, soon
as he had removed Melissa to Bergher's. He
VOL. II. K
made such use of his time as to reach the
mansion at the hour appointed. He found
the draw-bridge down, the gate open, and
saw, as had been agreed upon, the light at the
lower window, glimmering through the
branches of trees. He was therefore assured
that Melissa was alone. His heart beat; a
joyful tremour seized his frame: Miss
Bloomfield was soon to be under his
protection
,
for a short time at least. He drove up
to the house, sprang out of the carriage, and
fastened his horse to a locust tree; the door
was open, he went in, flew lightly up stairs,
entered her chamberMelissa was not there!
A small fire was blazing on the hearth, and a
candle burning on the table. He stood
petrified
with amazement; then gazed around in
anxious solicitude. What could have
become
of her? It was impossible, he thought,
but that she must be there. Had she been
removed by fraud or force, the signal-candle
would not have been at the window.
Perhaps
in a frolicksome moment, she had
concealed
herself, for no other purpose than to
cause him a little perplexity. He therefore
took a candle and searched every corner of
the chamber, and every room in the house,
not even neglecting the garret and the cellar.
He then placed the candle in a lantern,
hastened
into the yard, and examined the
outhouses
;
he next went round the garden and the
inclosure
,
strictly exploring and investigating
every place, but he found her not. He
repeatedly
and loudly called her by name; he was
answered
only by the solitary echoes of the
wilderness
.
Again he returned to the house,
traversed
the rooms, there also calling on the
name of Melissa; his voice reverberated from
the walls, dying away in solemn murmurs in
the distant, empty apartments. Thus did he
continue his anxious scrutiny, alternately, in
the house and the inclosure, until day, but no
traces could be discovered, nothing seen or
heard of Melissa. What had become of her
he could not form even a conjecture. Nothing
was removed from the house: the beds, the
chairs, the table, all the furniture remained in
the same condition as when he was there the
night before; the candle, as had been agreed
upon, was at the window, and another
burning
on the table; it was therefore evident
that she could not have been long gone when
he arrived. By what means she had thus
suddenly disappeared was a most deep and
inscrutable mystery.
When the sun had arisen he once more
repeated his inquisitive search, but with the
same effect. He then, in extreme vexation
and disappointment, flung himself into the
chaise, and drove from the mansion.
Frequently
did he look back at the building,
anxiously did he scrutinize every
surrounding
and receding object. A thrill of pensive
recollection vibrated through his frame as
he passed the gate, and the keen,
agonizing
pangs of blasted hope, pierced his
heart, as his carriage rolled over the bridge.
Once more he cast a longing, lingering
look upon the premises behind, sacred only
for the treasure they lately possessed, then
sank backward in his seat, and was dragged
slowly away.
He had been informed by Melissa that
Jeffrey's
hut was situate about one mile north
from the old mansion. When he came out
near the road he left his horse and carriage,
after securing them, went in search of the
cottage
,
and soon discovered it. He knocked at
the door, which was opened by Jeffrey, whom
Alonzo readily knew, from the portrait
Melissa
had drawn of him. The man started in
amazement.
Understanding, said Alonzo, that you
have the charge of the old building in yonder
field, I have come to know if you can inform
me what has become of the lady who has been
confined there.
Confined! said he, I did not know she
was confined.
Recollecting himself, I mean the young
lady who has lately resided there with her
aunt, replied Alonzo.
She was there last night, answered the
other, but old Madam has gone into the
country and has not returned.
Haventon then told him of the situation of
the mansion, and that the young lady was
gone likewise. Jeffrey said she was there about
sunset and according to her request he had
left the keys of the gate and bridge with her.
He desired Alonzo to tarry there until he ran
to the building. He returned in about half
an hour: she is gone, sure enough, said
he; but how or where, it is impossible for me
to guess. Convinced that he knew nothing
VOL. II. K 2
of the matter, Alonzo left him and returned
to Vincent's.
Vincent and his lady were much
surprised
at Alonzo's account of Melissa's
sudden
disappearance, and they wished to
ascertain
whether her father's family knew any
thing of the circumstance. Social intercourse
had been suspended between the families of
Vincent and Col. Bloomfield, as the latter had
taxed the former with improperly
endeavouring
to promote the views of Haventon. They
therefore procured a neighbouring woman to
visit Mrs. Bloomfield, to see if any
information
could be obtained concerning Melissa;
but the old lady had learnt nothing since her
departure with Martha, who had never yet
returned
.
Alonzo left Vincent's, and went to
Bergher's. He informed them of all that had
happened since he was there, of which,
before
,
they had heard nothing. At the houses
of Bergher and Vincent, he resided some time,
while they made the most diligent search to
discover Melissa, but not a particle of
information
could be obtained.
He then travelled into various parts of the
country, making such inquiries as caution
dictated
,
of all whom he saw, but he found none
who could give him the least intelligence of
his lost Melissa. In the course of his
wanderings
he again passed near the old
mansion
:
he felt an inclination once more to visit
it; he proceeded over the bridge, which was
down, but found the gate locked. He
therefore
hurried back and called on Jeffrey. On
questioning him whether he had yet heard
any thing of the young lady and her aunt,
All I know of the matter, said Jeffrey, is,
that two days after you was here, old Madam
came back with a strange gentleman, and
ordered
me to go and fetch the furniture away
from the room they had occupied. I asked
her what had become of young Madam. She
told me that young Madam had behaved
improperly
,
and she found fault with me for
leaving the keys in her possession, though I
did not know that any harm could come of it.
From the discourse which my wife and I
afterwards
overheard between old Madam and the
strange gentleman, I understood that young
Madam had been sent to reside with some
friend or relation at a great distance, because
her father wanted her to marry a man, and
she wanted to marry somebody else.
From Jeffrey's plain and simple narrative,
Alonzo concluded that Melissa had been
removed
by her father's orders, or through the
agency or instigation of her aunt. Whether
his visit to the mansion had been somehow
discovered or suspected, or whether she was
removed by some preconcerted or antecedent
plan, he could not conjecture. Still, the
situation
in which he found things on the night he
went to convey her away, left an inexplicable
impression on his mind. He could in no
manner account how the candle should be
placed at the window according to
agreement
,
unless it had been done by herself, and
if so, how had she so suddenly disappeared?
He asked Jeffrey where Melissa's aunt now
was. She left here yesterday morning, he
answered, with the strange gentleman I
mentioned, on a visit to some of her friends.
Was the strange gentleman you speak of
her brother? asked Alonzo.
I believe not, replied Jeffrey, smiling,
and winking at his wife; I know not who
he was; somebody that Madam seems to like
pretty well.
Have you the care of the old house?
asked Alonzo.
Yes, answered he; I have the keys; I
will go with you there if you wish; perhaps
you will like to buy it; Madam said
yesterday
she intended to sell it. Alonzo told him
he had no thoughts of purchasing, thanked
him for his information and departed.
Convinced now that Melissa was removed
by the agency of her persecutors, he
compared
the circumstances of Jeffrey's story.
She had been sent to reside with some
friend or relation at a great distance. This
great distance
he believed to be
New-London
,
and her
friend or relation
, Glenford,
her cousin, with whom she would be safe,
and Bowman have an opportunity of
renewing
his addresses. Under these impressions
he did not long hesitate what course to adopt;
he determined to repair to New-London
immediately
.
In pursuance of this design he went to his
father's. He found the old gentleman with
his man contentedly tilling his farm, and his
mother cheerfully attending to household
affairs
,
as their narrow circumstances would
not permit her to keep a maid without
embarrassment
.
Haventon's soul sickened on
comparing
the present state of his family with its
former affluence; but it was an unspeakable
consolation to see his aged parents contented
and happy in their humble situation, and
though the idea could not pluck the thorn
from his bosom, yet it tended temporarily to
assuage the anguish of the wound.
You have been long gone, my son, said
his father; I scarcely knew what had
become
of you. Since I have been a farmer
I know little of what is going on in the world;
and indeed we were never happier in our
lives: after stocking and paying for my farm,
and purchasing the requisites for my business,
I have considerable money at command. We
live frugally, and realize the blessings of
health, comfort and contentment; our only
disquietude is on your account, Alonzo:
your affair with Miss Bloomfield, I suppose,
is not so favourable as you could wish; but
despair not, my son; hope is the harbinger of
fairer prospects; rely on Providence, which
never deserts those who submissively bow to
the justice of its dispensations.
Unwilling to disturb the serenity of his
parents, Alonzo did not disclose to them his
troubles; he answered that probably affairs
would yet take a favourable turn; but that as in
the present state of his mind he thought change
of situation might be of advantage, he asked
liberty to travel for some little time. To this
his father consented, and offered him a part
of the money he had on hand, which Alonzo
refused, saying he did not expect to be long
gone, and his resources had not yet failed
him. He immediately sold off his books,
horses, carriages, and his wardrobe, the
insignia
of his better days, but now useless
appendages
,
from which he raised no
inconsiderable
sum. He then took a tender and
affectionate
leave of his parents and set out for
New-London.
He journeyed along with a heavy heart
and in an enfeebled frame of spirits. Through
disappointment, vexation and the fatigues he
had endured while wandering about for so
long a time in search of Melissa, despondency
had seized upon his mind and indisposition
upon his body. He put up the first night
within a few miles of New-Haven, and as he
passed through that town the next morning,
the scenes of early life in which he had there
been an actor, moved in melancholy succession
over his recollection. That day he grew more
indisposed; he experienced an unusual
languor
,
listlessness and debility; chills,
followed
by hot flashes, succeeded; then heavy
pains in the head and back, with incessant
and intolerable thirst. It was near night
when he reached Killingworth, where he
halted, as he felt unable to go farther; he
called for a bed, and through the night was
racked with severe pain, and scorched with
a burning fever.
The next morning he requested that the
physician of the town might be called, who
came and ordered a prescription which gave
his patient some relief; and by strict attention
he was able in a few weeks to pursue his
journey. He arrived at New-London, and
took lodgings with a private family of the
name of Wyllys, in a retired part of the town.
The first object was to ascertain whether
Melissa was at her cousin's. But how should
he obtain this information; he knew no
persons
in the town except it were those whom he
had reason to suppose were leagued against
him. Should he go to the house of her
cousin
it might prove an injury to her if she was
there, and could answer no valuable purpose
if she was not. The evening after he
arrived
,
he wrapped himself up in his cloak, and
walked towards Glenford's house: he stopped
when he came against it to see if he could
make any discoveries. As people were passing
and repassing the street, he got over into a
small inclosure, and stood under a tree about
thirty yards from the building; he had not long
occupied this station before a lady came to the
chamber window, which was flung up,
opposite
to the place where he stood; she leaned
out, looked earnestly around for a few
minutes
,
then shut it and retired. She had
brought a candle into the room, but did not
bring it to the window, of course he could
not distinguish her features so as to identify
them. He knew it was not Mrs. Glenford,
and from her appearance he believed it to be
Melissa. Again the window opened, and
again the same lady appeared; she took a
seat at a little distance within the room, and
reclined with her head upon one hand, her
arm appearing to be supported by a toilet or
table. Alonzo's heart beat violently; he now
had a side view of her face, and was more
VOL. II. L
than ever convinced that it was Melissa; her
delicate features, pale and dejected as when
he last saw her; her brown hair, falling in
artless circles around her neck, her arched
eyebrows and pensive aspect. He moved
towards
the house with a design if possible to
draw her attention, and should it really prove
to be Melissa, to discover himself; he had
proceeded but a few steps before she arose,
shut the window, retired, and the light
disappeared
.
He waited a considerable time, but
she came no more. Supposing she had
retired
for the night, he slowly withdrew,
chagrined
at his disappointment, yet pleased
with the discovery he had made.
The people with whom Haventon had taken
lodgings were fashionable and respectable.
The following afternoon they had appointed
to visit a friend, and invited him to
accompany
them; when they named the family
where their visit was intended, he found it
was Glenford's; he therefore declined going
under pretence of business; he however
waited with anxiety for their return, hoping
he should be able to learn by their
conversation
whether Melissa was there or not.
When they returned he made some
inquiries
respecting the families in town, until the
discourse turned upon Glenford's. The
young lady who resides there, said Mrs.
Wyllys, is undoubtedly in a confirmed
decline
;
she will never recover.
Alonzo started, deeply agitated: Is the
lady a relative of the family? he asked.
She is sister to Glenford's wife,
answered
Mr. Wyllys; her father lives in Newport,
and she has come here with the view of
amending
her health.
Do you not think, said Mrs. Wyllys,
that she resembles Miss Bloomfield, their
cousin, who resided there some time ago?
Very much, indeed, replied her
husband
,
only she is not so beautiful.
Again was Alonzo disappointed, and again
did he experience a melancholy pleasure:
the previous evening he trusted he had
discovered
Melissa, but to find her in a
hopeless
decline was worse than that she should
remain undiscovered.
It is reported, said Mrs. Wyllys, that
Miss Bloomfield has been on the verge of
matrimony, but that the treaty was somehow
broken off; perhaps Bowman will renew his
addresses, should this be the case.
Bowman has other business than
addressing
the ladies, answered Mr. Wyllys; he
has marched to the lines near New-York with
his new-raised company of volunteers.
From this discourse Haventon perceived
Melissa was not the person he had seen
at her cousin's the preceding evening, and
that she was not there; and also that
Bowman
had left the town. Where to search next,
or what course to pursue, he could not
determine
.
The ensuing morning he arose early and
wandered about the town. As he passed by
the house of Glenford he saw the lady who
had appeared at the window, walking in the
garden; her air, her figure, had very much
the appearance of Melissa, but the
lineaments
of her countenance, when viewed by
the light of day, were widely dissimilar.
Alonzo felt no strong curiosity farther to
examine her features, but passing on,
returned
to his lodgings.
How he was now to proceed he could not
readily decide. To return home appeared
as useless as to tarry where he was. For
many weeks had he travelled and searched
every place where he thought it probable
Melissa
might be found; both among her
relatives
and elsewhere, the strictest inquiries
had been made; he had used every effort to
obtain some clue to her removal from the old
mansion, but could learn nothing but what he
had been told by Jeffrey. If his friends
should even find her, they could not inform
him thereof, as no one knew where he was.
Would it not therefore be best for him to
return
and consult with those friends, and if
nothing had been heard of her, pursue some
other mode of investigation? He could at
least leave directions where he might be
written to, in case they should have any thing
whereof to apprize him.
An incident tended to confirm this
resolution
.
He one night dreamed that he was
sitting
in a strange house, reflecting on his
present
situation, when Melissa suddenly entered.
VOL. II. L 2
Her countenance was pale, sickly and
dejected
;
her elegant form had wasted away,
her eyes were sunk, her cheeks fallen, her
lips livid. He fancied it to be night: she
held a candle in her hand; smiling
languidly
upon him, she turned and went out,
beckoning to him as she retired: he thought
he immediately arose and followed her; she
glided through several winding rooms till
finally
he lost sight of her, and the light
gradually
fading away, he was involved in deep
darkness; he groped along, and at length
saw a faint, distant glimmer, the course of
which he pursued until he came into an
extensive
apartment hung with black tapestry,
and illuminated by a number of bright torches;
in one corner thereof appeared a hearse,
on which some person was laid; he went up
to it; the first object that arrested his
attention
was the lovely form of Melissa,
shrouded
in the sable vestments of death! Cold
and lifeless, stretched upon the hearse,
beautiful
even in dissolution. The dying smile
of complacency had not yet deserted her
cheek: the music of her voice had ceased;
her fine eyes were closed for ever; animation
no longer enlightened her features, but
loveliness
was still there. Insensible to objects
in which she once delighted; to afflictions
which had blasted her youth and blooming
prospects, and drained the streams of life,
she lay like blossomed trees of spring,
overthrown
by rude and boisterous winds. The
deep groans which convulsed the distracted
bosom, and shook the trembling frame of
Alonzo
,
broke the delusive charm; he awoke,
rejoiced to find it but a dream, though it
impressed
his mind with doleful and portentous
forebodings and apprehensions.
It was long before he could again close his
eyes to sleep; he at length fell into a
slumber
,
and again he dreamed. He fancied
himself with Melissa at the house of her
father
,
who had consented to their union, and
that the marriage ceremony was soon to be
performed. He thought she appeared as in
her most fortunate and sprightly days, before
the darts of adversity and the thorns of
affliction
had wounded her heart. Her father
seemed to be divested of all his awful
sternness
,
and received him graciously and with
complacency. His own parents were there
also, and apparently happy. A large
concourse
of his former friends were assembled;
Edgar was among them, who taking the hand
of Melissa, placed it in Alonzo's. He
awoke
,
and the horrors of his former dream
were dissipated by the happy influences of
the latter. Who knows, he said, but this
may be the case; but that the sun of peace
may yet dispel the glooms of these afflictive
hours?
He arose, determined to return home in a
few days. He went out and enjoyed his
morning walk in a more composed frame of
spirits than he had for some time
experienced
:
he returned, and as he was
entering
the door, saw the weekly newspaper of the
town, which had been published that
morning
and which the carrier had just thrown
into the hall. The family had not yet arisen.
He took the paper, carried it to his chamber,
and opened it to read the news of the day;
he ran his eye hastily over it, and was about
to lay it aside, when the obituary arrested
his attention, by a display of broad black
lines. The first article he read therein was as
follows:
DIED, of a consumption, on the 26th ult.
at Bloomfield Hill, near Charleston,
South-Carolina
,
where she had recently arrived from
Connecticut, Miss
Melissa Bloomfield
,
the
amiable and only daughter of Col. Bloomfield,
in the 19th year of her age
.
The paper dropped from his palsied hand
a sudden faintness came upon himthe room
grew darkhe staggered, and fell senseless
upon the floor.
CHAPTER XIII.

The
incidents of our story will here produce
a pause.The fanciful class of our readers may
be ready to cast it aside in chagrin and
disappointment
.
Such an event, may they say,
we were not prepared to expect. After so
many and such various trials of heart; after
innumerable difficulties vanquished, almost
invincible obstacles removed, and insuperable
barriers surmounted; after attending the hero
and heroine of your tale through the
diversified
scenes of anxiety, suspense, hope,
disappointment
,
expectation, joy, sorrow,
anticipated
bliss, sudden and disastrous woe; after
elevating them to the threshold of happiness,
then, by the premature death of one, to plunge
the other, instantaneously, in deep and
irretrievable
despair, must not, cannot be right.
Your history will hereafter become languid
and spiritless; the subject will be
uninteresting
,
the theme unengaging, since the
geni
which animated and enlivened it, is gone for
ever.
Reader of sensibility, reflect.Are we not
detailing facts? Shall we gloss them over
with false colouring? Must we describe things
as they are, or as they are not? Shall we draw
with the pencil of nature, or of art? Do we
indeed paint life as it is, or as it is not? Cast
thine eyes, reader, over the ephemeral circle
of passing and fortuitous events; view the
change of
contingencies;
mark well the varied
and shifting scenery in the great drama of
Time; seriously contemplate Nature in her
operations; minutely examine the entrance,
the action, and the exit of characters on the
stage of existence; then say, if
disappointment
,
distress, misery and calamitous woe, are
not the inalienable portion of the susceptible
bosom. Say, if the possession of refined
feelings
be desirable, the lot of
Nature's children
enviable; whether to
these
, through life, the
sprinklings of comfort are sufficient to give a
zest to the bitter banquets of adversity;
whether
,
indeed, sorrow, sighing, and tears, are
not the inseparable attendants of all those
whose hearts are the repositories of tender
affections
and pathetic sympathies. But what
says the moralist?Portray life as it is;
delude not the senses by deceptive
appearances
.
Arouse your hero; call to his aid
stern philosophy and sober reason; they will
dissipate the rainbow glories of unreal
pleasure
,
and banish the glittering meteors of
unsubstantial
happiness: or if these fail, lead
him to the mild presence of holy religion; she
will regulate the fires of fancy, and assuage the
tempest of the passions; she will illuminate the
dark wilderness, and smooth the thorny paths
of life; will point him to worlds where
sorrows
never approach, to joys beyond the
tomb, and pour the balm of consolation and
serenity
over his wounded soul.
Shall we indeed arouse Alonzo? Alas! to
what pathos of grief, what sublimity of
wretchedness must we awake him! To a
world, void and cheerless to his heart,
desolate
and dreary to his soul.
Alonzo revivedWhy am I, he
exclaimed
,
recalled to this dungeon of torment! Why
was not my spirit permitted to take its flight
to regions where my guardian angel has gone?
Why am I cursed with memory!O that I
might be blessed with forgetfulness! But
why think of blessings? Heaven never had
one in store for me. Where are fled my
anticipated
joys? To the bosom, the dark
bosom
of the oblivious tomb! There lie all the
graces worthy of love in life; all the virtues
deserving lamentation in death. There rests
perfectionperfection has here been found,
and, Oh! for ever lost! Was she not all that
even Heaven could demandfair, lovely,
holy
,
virtuous? Her tender solicitudesher
enrapturing
endearmentsher soul-inspiring
blandishments; goneirrevocably gone!
That celestial formthat discriminate mind
unsullied as lightchaste as seraphs; a prey to
wormsmingled with incorporeal shadows
regardless of former inquietudes or delights;
regardless of the keen anguish which now
wrings tears of blood from my
despairing
heart! Eternal Disposer of events! if
virtue
be thy special care, why is the fairest
flower in the garden of innocence and purity,
blasted like a noxious weed! Why is the
brightest gem of excellence trampled in the
dust like a worthless pebble?Why is Melissa
hurried to the tomb! Thus raved Alonzo,
VOL. II. M
it was evident that delirium had partially
seized his intellect.
He arose and flung himself on the bed, in
indiscribable agony. And what, alas! he
again exclaimed, now remains for me!
Existence, and unparalleled misery. The
consolation even of death, is denied me! O
that I were an insect, that the first passing
foot might crush me! then could I die, and be
with Melissa.But sheAh! where is she?
Oh! reflection insupportable! insufferable
consideration! Must that heavenly frame
putrify, moulder, and crumble into dust!
Must the loathsome spider nestle on her snowy
bosom! the odious reptile riot on her
delicate
limbs! the worm revel amidst the
roses
of her cheek, fatten on her temples, and
bask in the lustre of her eyes!Great God!
what a thought! Alas! the lustre has been
dimmed in death; the bloom decayed, the
harmony of her voice has ceased, the graces
the elegancies of formthe innumerable
delicacies of airall are gone, and I am left
in a state of misery which defies mitigation or
comparison.
Exhausted by excess of grief, he now lay
in stupifying agony until he was summoned
to breakfast; he told the servant he was
indisposed
,
and requested he might not be
disturbed
.
Mr. Wyllys and his lady came up,
anxious to yield him any assistance in their
power, and advised him to call a physician;
he thanked them, but said it was unnecessary;
he only wanted rest. His extreme distress of
mind brought on a relapse of the fever from
which he had but partially recovered. For
several days he continued in a very dangerous
and doubtful state. A physician was called,
contrary to his choice or knowledge, as most
part of the time his mind was delirious and
his sensation imperfect: this was probably
the cause of baffling the disorder; he was in
a measure insensible to his woes; he did not
oppose the prescriptions of the physician;
the fever abated, nature triumphed over
disease
of body, he slowly recovered, but the
malady of his mind was not removed.
He contemplated on the past. I fear,
said he, I have murmured against the
wisdom
of Providence. Forgive, O merciful
Creator! forgive the frenzies of distraction!
He now recollected that Melissa once told
him she had an uncle who resided at
Charleston
,
in South Carolina: thither he supposed
she had been sent by her father when she was
removed from the old mansion, in order to
prevent his having access to her, and with a
view to compel her to marry Bowman. Her
appearance indicated a deep decline when
he last saw her. There, said he, far
removed from friends and acquaintance
there did she languish, there did she die, a
victim to excessive grief and cruel parental
persecution!
Soon as he was able to leave his room, he
walked out one evening, and in deep
contemplation
roved he knew not whither. The
moon shone brilliantly from her throne of
glory; the chill, heavy dews of autumn
glittered
on the decaying verdure. The

Local names given to certain American insects,
from their sound. They are well known in various
parts of the United States; generally make their
appearance about the end of August, and
continue
until destroyed by the frest. The notes of the

solemn, melodious, and mournfully pleasing. They

the night.
croaked hoarsely among the trees; the
Dirkle
[5]
sang mournfully in the grass.
Alonzo
heard them not; he was insensible to all
external objects, until he had imperceptibly
wandered to the ROCK on the point of the
beach, verging the Sound, to which he
once attended Melissa from the house of
Glenford.
Had the whole artillery of heaven exploded
in sheeted flame from the skieshad raging
winds hurled the roaring waves over the tops
of mountainshad an instantaneous
earthquake
burst beneath his feet, his frame would
not have been so shocked, his soul so
agitated
!
Sudden as the blaze darts from
electric
clouds, was he aroused to a lively sense
of blessings entombed! The memory of
departed
joys passed with rapidity over his
imagination; his first meeting with Melissa;
the evening he attended her to that place;
her frequent allusions to the scenery there
displayed
,
when they were traversing the fields,
or reclining in the bower on her favourite hill;
in fine, all the vicissitudes through which
they had passed, were recalled to his mind.
His fancy saw herfelt her gently leaning on
VOL. II. M 2
his arm, while he tremblingly pressed her hand.
Again he saw smiling health crimsoning the
lilies of her cheek; again he perceived the
bright soul of exquisite feeling sparkling in her
eyethe air of easethe graces of attitude
her brown hair circling the borders of her
snowy robe: again was he enraptured by the
melody of her voice: once more would he
have been happy, had not fancy inverted the
scenebut alas! she shifted the curtainhe
saw Melissa stretched on the sable hearse,
wrapped in the dreary vestments of the grave
the roses witheredthe lilies faded
motionless
the
graces fledher eyes fixed, and
sealed in the glaze of death! Spontaneously
he sank upon his knees, and thus poured
forth the overcharged burden of his
anguished
bosom:
Infinite Ruler of all events! Great
Sovereign
of this ever changing world!
Omnipoten
Controller of vicissitudes! Omniscient
Dispenser of destinies! The beginningthe
progressionthe end, are thine.
Unsearchable
are thy purposes! mysterious thy
movements
!
inscrutable thy operations! An atom
of thy creation, wildered in the mazes of
ignorance
and unparalleled affliction, would bow
to thy decrees. Surrounded with
impenetrable
gloomsunable to scrutinize the past
incompetent
to explore the futurefain would
he sayThy will be done!And O, that
it might be consistent with that high will,
to call
this atom
from regions of wretchedness
and woe, to worlds of light and glory, where
his only consolation is gone!
Thus prayed the heart-broken Alonzo. It
was indeed a
worldly prayer
, but perhaps as
pure and as acceptable as many of our modern
professors would have made on a similar
occasion
.
He arose, and repaired to his
lodgings
.
One determination only he had now fixed
uponto bury himself and his griefs from all
with whom he had formerly been acquainted.
Why should he return to scenes of former
anxiety, comfort and inquietude, where every
countenance tended to renew his mourning;
where every door would be inscribed with a
memento mori
, and where every object would
he shrouded in crape! He therefore turned
his attention to the army; but the army was
far distant, and he was too feeble to prosecute
a journey of such an extent.
A convoy was at that time preparing from
various parts of the United States for the
protection of our European trade; they were
to rendezvous at a certain station, and thence
proceed with the merchantmen under their
care to the ports of France and Holland,
where our commerce principally centred,
and return with some other mercantile fleet
in charge. One of these ships of war was
then nearly fitted out at New-London.
Haventon
offered himself to the captain, who,
pleased with his appearance, gave him the
station of commander of marines.
Alonzo prepared himself with all speed for
the voyage. He sought, he wished no
acquaintance
.
His only place of resort, except
to his lodgings and the ship, was to Melissa's
rock; there he bowed as to the shrine of her
spirit, and there he consecrated his devotions.
As he was one day passing through the
town, a gentleman stepped out of an adjoining
house and accosted him: he immediately
recognized
the person to be Glenford, whose
dress of full mourning sufficiently
indicated
that he had been apprized of Melissa's
death. Glenford invited Haventon to his
house, who could not complaisantly refuse
the invitation; he therefore accepted it, and
passed an hour with him, from whom he
learnt that Melissa had been sent to her
uncle's
at Charleston for the recovery of her
health, as Glenford understood, where she
died. Her premature death, said he,
has borne so heavily upon her aged father,
that it is feared he will not long survive.
Well may it wring his bosom, thought
Alonzo
;
how can his conscience ever be at
peace! Whether Glenford had been informed
of the particulars of Alonzo's unfortunate
attachment
,
was not known, as he said nothing
on the subject; neither did he inquire into
Haventon's prospects; he only invited him to
call again. Alonzo thanked him, but replied
it would be doubtful, as he should shortly
leave town. He made no one acquainted
with his intentions.
The day at length arrived when the ship
was to sail, and Haventon to leave the shores
of America. They spread their canvas to
propitious gales; the breezes rushed from
their woody coverts, and majestically wafted
them from the harbour. Slowly the land
receded
;
fields, forests, hills, mountains, towns
and villages leisurely withdrew, until they
were mingled in one common mass; the
ocean opening, expanded and widened,
presenting
to the astonished eyes of the
untried
mariner its wilderness of waters. Near
sunset Alonzo ascended the mast to take a
last view of a country once so dear, but
whose charms were now lost for ever. The
land still appeared like a semicircular border
of dark green velvet on the edge of a convex
mirror; the sun sank in fleecy golden vapour
behind it; it soon dwindled to discoloured
and irregular spots, which seemed like
objects
floating amidst the blue mists of
distance
,
on the verge of the main, and
immediately
all was lost beneath the spherical,
watery surface. Alonzo fixed his eyes as
nearly as his judgment could direct towards
Melissa's favourite rock, till nothing but sea
was discoverable. With a heart-parting sigh
he then descended. They had now launched
into the illimitable world of billows, and the
sable wings of night brooded over the
boundless
main.
A new scene opened to Alonzo in the
wonders
of the mighty deep. The sun rising
from and setting in the ocean; the
widespread
region of watery waste, now smooth
as polished glass, now urged into irregular,
rolling hillocks, then swelled to
Blue, tumbling billows, topp'd with foam,
or gradually rising into mountainous waves.
Often would he traverse the deck amidst the
still hours of midnight, when the moon
silvered
over the liquid surface: Bright
luminary
of the lonely hour, he would say,
that now shedest thy mild and placid ray
on the woe-worn head of fortune's fugitive,
dost thou not also pensively shine upon the
sacred and silent grave of my Melissa?
Favourable breezes wafted them for many
days over the bosom of the Atlantic. At
length the atmosphere indicated a storm; the
wind began to blow strongly from the
south-west
,
and soon came on a violent gale; the
dingy scud first flew swiftly along the sky;
then dark and heavy clouds filled the
atmosphere
,
mingling with the topgallant streamers
of the ship. Night hovered over the ocean,
rendered horrible by the intermitting blaze
of lightning, the awful crash of thunder,
and the deafening roar of winds and waves.
The sea was rolled into mountains, capped
with foaming fire. Now the ship was soaring
among the thunders of heaven, now sinking in
the abyss of waters.
The storm dispersed the fleet, so that when
it abated the vessel in which Alonzo sailed
was alone; they, however, kept on their course
of destination, after repairing their rigging,
which had been considerably disordered by
the violence of the gale.
The next morning they discovered a sail
which they fondly hoped might prove to be
one of their own fleet, and accordingly made
for it. The chase shortened sail, and towards
noon, wore round and bore down upon them,
when they perceived that it was not one of
their convoy. It appeared to be of about equal
force and dimensions with those of their own
ship; they therefore, in order to prepare for
the worst, got ready with all speed for action.
They slowly approached each other,
manuvring
for the advantage, till the strange ship
ran up British colours, and fired a gun, which
was immediately answered by the other,
under
the flag of the United States. They now
found her to be a forty-four gun frigate;
the American carried but forty. The
cannonade
shortly became general, nor was it
long before a close and severe action took
place.
The roar of cannon, the crash of musketry,
the shouts of the combatants, the groans of
the wounded and dying, inspired Alonzo's
bosom
with the ardour of battle. He was
fighting
in the cause of freedom and his country.
Both ships were completely enveloped in
smoke and flame. The main and
mizzenmasts
of the British frigate went by the board,
as did also the foremast of the American ship.
At length Haventon heard the command of
his captain, to
Board!
Instantly the
Briton
was laid along side, and seized by
grapplings
.
Then Destruction rioted on human
carcases; then Slaughter swam in gore.
Alonzo
,
fixing a stern eye on death, drew his
sword, and rushed into the midst of the
conflict
.
The Americans sprang over the sides
of the British vessel; a terrible contest
ensued
,
but they were driven back with loss,
and in their turn boarded by the English, who
were instantly cut to pieces. Pikes
contended
with bayonets, and swords clashed upon
daggers. The decks were piled with carnage,
and the scuppers spouted blood! Again
VOL. II. N
blazed the musketry, again thundered the
artillery
,
and again the brave American crew
surged
upon the deck of the enemy: the shock was
resistless; the Britons fell or were driven
below
;
their colours were struck, they yielded
to capture, and the storm of battle ceased.
Both ships were wrecks; not a mast was
standing on either; their rigging cut, their
sails in fritters, and their hulks much
damaged
.
Such was their shattered condition
that neither could manage a single gun with
celerity. The British had lost their captain,
first and second lieutenants, with several other
officers, and more than half their crew, most
of the remainder being wounded. The
second
American officer was slain, and their
loss in men, both killed and wounded, was
nearly equal to that of the enemy. It was
soon perceived that the British frigate must
sink, as she had received several shots
between
wind and water; all hands were
therefore
set to work to remove the prisoners on
board the American ship. While thus
employed
they discovered a large sail bearing
down upon them, which soon came up and
proved to be an English ship of the line.
The victorious Americans, unable to resist,
were immediately captured, and with their
prisoners, so dearly vanquished, taken on
board the English ship. The British frigate
shortly went down, and was for ever buried
beneath mountains of ponderous waves.
Six glasses measured the duration of this
terrible conflict. Alonzo was slightly
wounded
by a musket ball which grazed his left
side, and with a sabre in the arm. The
Briton
,
with the American ship in tow, soon made
sail, and in a few days reached England.
The wounded prisoners were sent to a
hospital
,
but the others were confined in a strong
prison within the precincts of London.
The latter were huddled into an apartment
with British convicts of various description.
Among these Alonzo observed one whose
demeanour
arrested his attention. A deep
melancholy
was impressed upon his features;
his eye was wild and despairing, his figure
interesting, tall, elegant and handsome. He
appeared to be about twenty-five years of
age. He seldom conversed, but when he did,
it was readily discovered that his education
had been above the common cast, and that he
possessed an enlightened and discriminating
mind. Haventon sympathetically sought his
acquaintance, and discovered therein a unison
of woe. One evening when the prisoners
were retired to rest, the stranger, upon
Alonzo's
request, recited the following incidents
of his life:
You express, said he, some surprise
at finding a man of my appearance in so
degraded
a situation, and you wish to learn the
events which have plunged me into this abject
state. These I will briefly relate, and your
wonder will cease.
My name is Henry Malcomb; my father
was a clergyman in the west of England, and
descended from one of the most respectable
families in those parts. I received a classical
education, and then entered the military
school, as I was designed for the army, to
which my earliest inclinations led. Soon as
my education was considered complete, an
ensign's commission was procured for me in
one of the regiments destined for India:
previous
to its departure I became acquainted
with a Miss Vernon, who was a few years
younger than myself, and the daughter of a
gentleman farmer who had recently purchased
and removed to an estate in my father's
parish
.
Every thing that was graceful and
lovely appeared centred in her person; all
that was virtuous and excellent in her mind.
I sought her hand: our souls soon became
united in the indissoluble bonds of the
sincerest
love; and as there existed no parental
or other impediments to our union, it was
agreed that when I returned from India,
where it was expected my stay would be
short, the marriage solemnities should be
performed
.
Solemn oaths of constancy passed
between us, and I sailed with my regiment.
While in India I received from her and
returned letters filled with the tenderest
expressions
of anxiety and regret of absence.
At length the time came when we were to
reembark
for England, where we arrived after
an absence of about eighteen months. The
moment I reached land I hastened to the house
of Mr. Vernon to visit the object I most
valued on earth. She received me with all
the ardency of affection, and even shed tears
of joy in my presence. I pressed her to
name the day which was to perfect our union
and happiness, and the next Sunday, four
days only distant, was agreed upon for me to
VOL. II. N 2
lead her to the altar. How did my heart
bound at the prospect of making Miss Vernon
my own; of possessing in her all that could
render life agreeable! I hastened home to
my family and informed them of my
approaching
bliss, who all sympathized in the
anticipations of felicity which swelled my
bosom.
I had a sister, wild, thoughtless and gay,
who was several years younger than myself;
she had been the friend and confident of my
mistress while I was absent; Miss Vernon
passed an afternoon with her at my father's
one day; when she had departed my sister
requested
me to attend her in a private room;
we therefore retired, and she thus addressed
me:
`Henry, you know that to promote your
welfare, your happiness and your peace has
ever been the boast and pride of my heart:
nothing except this could extort the secret
which I shall now disclose, and which has
yet remained deposited in my own bosom;
my duty to a brother whom I esteem dear as
life, forbids me to remain silent. As an
affectionate
sister, I cannot tacitly see you
thus imposed upon: I cannot see you the
dupe and slave of an artful and insidious
woman
,
who does not sincerely return your love;
nor can I bear to witness your marriage with
one whose soul and affections are placed upon
another object.'
Here she paused, while I with insufferable
anguish of mind begged her to proceed.
`About six or eight months after your
departure
,'
she continued, `it was reported to
Miss Vernon that she had a rival in India;
that you had there found an American beauty
on whom you lavished those endearments
which belonged of right to her alone. This
news made at first a deep impression on her
mind, but it soon wore away, and whether
from this cause, from fickleness of
disposition
,
or that she never sincerely loved you,
I know not, but this I do know, that a youth
has been, for some time past, her almost
constant
companion.'
Again she hesitated. I laughed
convulsively
,
and requested her to continue.
`To convince you of this,' she
proceeded
,
`you need only tomorrow evening about
sunset, conceal yourself among the laurels near
the long avenue by the side of the rivulet
back of Mr. Vernon's house, where you will
undoubtedly surprise Miss Vernon and her
companion in their usual evening excursion.
If I should be mistaken I will submit to your
censure; but should you find it as I have
stated, you have only to rush from your
concealment
,
charge her with her perfidy, and
renounce her for ever.'
Of all the plagues, the torments, the
ourses, which torture the soul, suspicion of a
rival in love is the worst. Enraged,
confounded
,
astonished, it seemed as if my
bosom would have instantaneously burst. To
hide my emotions I left my sister's apartment,
after having thanked ner for her information
and promised to obey her injunctions. I
retired
to my own room and there poured out
my execrations. `Cursed woman!' I
exclaimed
,
`is it thus you requite my tender
love? Could a vague report of my
inconstancy
drive you to infidelity? Did not my
continual letters breathe constant adoration?
And did not yours portray the same sincerity
of affection? No; it was not this that caused
you to perjure your plighted vows. It was
that damnable passion for novelty, which
more or less holds a predominancy over your
whole sex. To a new coat, a new face, a
new lover, you will sacrifice honour,
principle
and virtue; and for these, when allied
with magnificent power and splendid wealth,
you will perjure your most sacred
engagements
,
though sealed in the sanctuary of
Heaven.' Thus did I rave through a
sleepless
night.
On the morrow, which was the day
previous
to our appointed marriage, I walked
into the fields, and before the time my sister
appointed had arrived, my feelings were
wrought up almost to the frenzy of
distraction
.
I repaired however to the spot and
concealed myself in the place she had named,
which was a tuft of laurels by the side of the
walk. I soon perceived Miss Vernon
strolling
down the avenue, arm in arm with a youth
elegantly dressed, and of singularly delicate
appearance. They were earnestly conversing
in a low tone of voice; the hand of my false
mistress was gently pressed in that of the
stranger. Soon as they had passed me they
turned aside and seated themselves in a little
arbour a few yards distant from the place where
I stood. The stranger clasped Miss Vernon in
his arms: `Dearest angel!' he exclaimed,
`what an interruption to our bliss is the
return
of my hated rival!'
With fond caresses and endearing
blandishments
,
`Fear nothing,' she replied; `I
have promised and must yield him my hand,
but you shall never be excluded from my
heart: we shall find sufficient opportunities
for private conference.'
I could restrain myself no longerMy
brain was on fire. Quick as lightning I
sprang from my covert, and presenting a
pistol
which I had concealed under my robe,
`Die!' I exclaimed, `thou false and
perjured
wretch, by the hand thou hast
dishonoured
,
a death too mild for so foul a crime!'
and immediately shot Miss Vernon through
the head, who fell dead at my feet! Then
suddenly drawing my sword, `And thou,
perfidious
contaminator and destroyer of my
bliss,' cried I, `go! attend thy companion in
infamy to the black regions of everlasting
torment!' So saying, I plunged my sword
into his bosom!
A screech of agony, attended by the
exclamation
`
Henry!your wife!your
sister
!
'
awoke me too late to terrors unutterable
to anguish unspeakableto woes
irretrievable
,
and insupportable despair! It was
indeed
my affianced wifeIt was indeed my
affectionate sister, arrayed in man's habit!
The one lay dead before methe other,
weltering
in her blood! With a feeble and
expiring
voice my sister informed me that in a
gay and inconsiderate moment they had
concerted
this plan to try my jealousy,
determining
to discover themselves soon as they
had made the experiment. `I forgive you
Henry!' she said, `I forgiveyour mistake'
and closed her eyes for ever in death!
What a scene for sensibilities like mine!
to paint or describe it exceeds the power of
language or imagination. I instantly turned
the sword against my own bosom; an
unknown
hand arrested it, and prevented its
entering
my heart. The report of the pistol,
and the dying screech of my sister, had
alarmed
Mr. Vernon's family, who arrived
at that moment, one of whom seized my
arm, and thus hindered me from destroying
my own life. I submitted to be bound and
conveyed to prison. My trial came on at the
last assizes; I made no defence, and was
condemned to death. Eight weeks from
tomorrow
is the day appointed for my
execution
.
I shall cheerfully meet my fate, for
who would endure life when rendered so
peculiarly, so eminently miserable!
The wretched Malcomb here ended his
tale of woe. No tear moistened his eye; his
grief was too despairing for tears: it preyed
upon his heart, drank the vital streams of
life, and burst in convulsive sighs from his
burning bosom.
Alonzo seriously reflected on the incidents
and events of this tragical story. Conscience
whispered him,
Are not Malcomb's miseries
superior
to thine?
candour and correct reason
must have answered YES. Melissa
perished
,
said he, but not by the hand of her
lover; she expired, but not through the
mistaken
frenzy of him who adored her; she
died, conscious of the unfeigned love I bore
her.
Haventon submitted to his fate with
fortitude
and firmness. All places, every scene
was to him equally alike. In a palace or a
prison, in bed or in battle, the thorn of woe
still rankled at his heart. He sought not to
prolong life, but religion taught him not to
destroy it. Happiness in this world he now
never expected. He did not even wish for
consolation or comfort, for without Melissa
he could not attain or enjoy them, if spread
around him, and she was low in the grave.
In whatever state or station, therefore, he
wore away life, was totally unimportant and
immaterial.
He and his fellow prisoners had been
robbed
when they were captured, of every thing
except the clothes they wore. Their
allowance
of provisions was scanty and poor. They
were confined in the third story of a lofty
prison, without fire, and with no other
bedding
than a little straw. Time rolled away;
no prospect appeared of their liberation,
either
by exchange or parole. Some of the
prisoners were removed, as new ones were
introduced, to other places of confinement,
until not one American was left but Alonzo.
VOL. II. O
Meantime the day appointed for the
execution
of Malcomb drew near. His past and
approaching fate filled the breast of
Haventon
with sympathetic sorrow. He saw his
venerable father, his mother, his friends and
acquaintance, with several pious clergymen,
alternately enter the prison to console and
comfort him, and to prepare him for the
unchangeable
state on which he was soon to
enter
.
He perceived his mind softened by their
advice and counsel; frequently would he
burst into tears; often in the solitary hours
of night was he heard addressing the throne of
grace for mercy and forgiveness. But deep
and inconsolable sorrow consumed and
wasted
him away; a slow but deleterious fever
had consequently implanted itself in his
constitution
;
exhausted nature could make but
a weak resistance against disease and
affliction
like his, and about a week previous to
the day appointed for his execution, he
expired
in peace and penitence, trusting in the
mercy of his Creator through the merits of a
Redeemer.
Shortly after this event orders came for
removing
some of the prisoners to a most
loathsome
place of confinement, in the suburbs of
the city: it fell to Alonzo's lot to be one.
This incident aroused him from his lethargy
and he formed a project for escaping. He
had observed that the gratings in one of the
windows of the apartment were loose, and
could easily be removed. One night when
the prisoners were asleep, he stripped off his
clothes, every article of which he cut into
narrow
slips, twisted them into ropes, tied them
together, and fastening an end thereof to one
of the strongest gratings, removed the others
until he had made an opening large enough
to crowd himself out; he then, by the rope
he had thus made, let himself down into the
yard of the prison. There he found a piece
of long timber, which he dragged to the wall,
clambered up thereon, and sprang over into
the street. His shoes and hat he left in
the prison, as useless encumberances without
his clothes, all of which he had converted into
the means of escape, so that he was literally
stark naked. He stood a moment to reflect
Here am I, said he, freed from my local
prison indeed, but in the midst of an enemy's
country, without a friend, without the means
of obtaining one day's subsistence,
surrounded
by the darkness of night, destitute of a
single article of clothing, and even unable to
form a resolution, what step next to take.
The ways of Heaven are marvellous.May
I silently bow to its dispensations!
CHAPTER XIV.
Pursue the bright charm, and it flies,
It flies ere its joys can be prest;
Bliss, like the gay bow in the skies,
Is gaz'd at, but never possest.
Honeywood
.
Haventon
passed along in this forlorn
condition, not knowing where to proceed,
or what course to adopt, but determining to
cast himself upon the clemency of the first
person he saw. It was about three o'clock
in the morning; the street was
illuminated
by lamps, and he feared falling into
the hands of the watch. For some time he
saw no person; at length a voice from
behind
called out, Hallo! messmate; what;
scudding under bare poles! You must have
encountered a saucy gale indeed, thus to have
carried away every rag of sail! Alonzo
turned, and saw the person who spoke: he
was a decent looking man, of middle age,
dressed in sailors' habit. Haventon had
often
heard of the generosity and magnanimity
of the British tars; he therefore approached
him and disclosed his real situation, not even
VOL. II. O 2
concealing his being taken in actual hostility
against the British government, and his
escape
from prison.
The seamen mused a few minutes; Thy
case, said he, is a little critical, but do not
despair; had I met thee as an enemy, I
should have fought thee as long as there was
a shot in the locker, but as how you are now
in distress, you have by the laws of war, a
right to refit, though in an enemy's port.
Perhaps I may be in as bad trim before the
war is ended. Then slipping off his coat and
giving it to Alonzo, I must take thee in
tow, he said, and turning, walked hastily
along the street, followed by Haventon; he
passed into a by-lane, entered a small house,
and taking Alonzo into a back room, opened
a trunk and handed out a shirt; there, said
he, pointing to a bed, you can turn in, and
sleep till tomorrow, when we will see what
can be done.
Next morning the sailor brought in a very
decent suit of clothes and presented them to
his guest. You must make this place your
home, said he, until you gain a more
favourable
breeze. In this great city you will
be safe; for even your late gaoler would not
know you in this dress; and perhaps some
opportunity may offer by which you can
return
to your own country, He told Alonzo
that his name was Jack Brown; that he was
midshipman on board the Severn; that he
had a wife and four children, and owned the
house in which they then were. In order to
prevent suspicion or discovery, said he, I
shall consider you as a relation from the
country until you are better provided for.
Haventon was then introduced to Brown's
family; the woman was amiable, and the
children lovely.
Here he remained for several weeks. One
day he was informed that a number of
American
prisoners were brought in. He went to
the place where they were landed, and saw
several led away to prison, and some who
were diseased or disabled, carried to the
hospital
,
which being near by, he entered it to see
how the sick and wounded were treated, and
found that they received as much attention as
could be reasonably expected.
As he passed along the different aisles, he
was surprised at hearing his name called by a
feeble voice; turning towards the place from
whence it proceeded, he saw stretched on a
mattress, a person who appeared on the point
of expiring. His visage was pale and
emaciated
,
his countenance haggard and ghastly,
his eyes inexpressive and glazy. He held out
his withered hand, and feebly beckoned to
Haventon, who immediately approached him;
his features appeared not unfamiliar, but
Alonzo
for a moment could not recollect him.
You do not know me, said the apparently
dying stranger.
Bowman! exclaimed Haventon, in
surprise
.
Yes, replied the sick man, it is
Bowman
;
you behold me on the verge of
eternity
I
have but a short time to continue in this
world.
Alonzo inquired how he came in the
power of the enemy.
By the fate of war, he replied. I was
taken in an action near the White Plains,
conducted
to New-York and confined on board a
prison-ship in the harbour, and thence sent
with a number of others to England. I had
received a wound in my thigh, from a musket
ball, during the action, which mortified, and
amputation was performed on the passage;
since then I have been rapidly wasting away,
and I now feel that the cold hand of death is
upon me. He became exhausted, and for
some time remained silent. Alonzo did not
before discover that he had lost a leg; he
now perceived it had been taken off close to
his body, and that he was worn to a skeleton.
When Bowman revived, he inquired into
Haventon's affairs, who related all that had
happened to him after leaving New-London.
You are unhappy, said Bowman, in
the death of your Melissa, to which it is
possible
I have been undesigningly an accessary.
I could say much on this subject, would my
strength admit; but it is needlessshe is
goneand I must soon go also. She was
sent to her uncle's at Charleston by her father,
whither I was to follow her. It was supposed
that thus widely removed from all access to
your company, she would yield to the
persuasion
of her friends, and renounce you;
her unexpected death however frustrated
every
design of this nature, and overwhelmed
her father and family in inexpressible woe.
Here Bowman ceased. Alonzo inquired
whether he was in need of any thing to render
him more comfortable; he replied he was
not; For the comforts of life, said he,
I have no relish; medical aid is applied, but
without effect. Judging he wanted rest,
Haventon then left him, promising to call
again in the morning.
When he returned the following day, he
perceived in Bowman an alarming alteration.
His extremities were cold; a chilling,
clammy
sweat stood upon his face; his respiration
was short and interrupted, his pulse weak
and intermitting.
He took the hand of Haventon, and feebly
pressing it, I am dying, said he in a faint
voice; if you ever return to America,
inform my friends of my fate. This
Alonzo
readily engaged to do, and assured him
also, that he would not leave him. Bowman
soon fell into a stupour; sensation became
suspended
,
his eyes rolled up and fixed;
sometimes
he experienced a partial revival, when
he would fall into incoherent mutterings,
calling
on the names of his deceased father, his
mother, and Melissa, his voice dying away
in imperfect moanings till his lips continued
to move without sound. Towards night he
lay silent, and only continued to breathe with
difficulty, till a slight convulsion gave the
freed spirit to the unknown regions of
immaterial
existence.
Haventon followed his remains to the grave;
a natural stone was placed at its head, on
which Alonzo carved the initials of the
deceased's
name, with the date of his death,
and left him to moulder with his native dust.
A few days after this event, Jack Brown
informed Alonzo that he had procured the
means of his escape. A person of my
acquaintance
,
said he, and whom I suppose
to be a smuggler, has agreed to carry you to
France; there, by application to the
American
minister, you will be enabled to get to
your own country, if that is your object.
About midnight I will pilot you on board, and
by tomorrow's sun you may be in France.
At the time appointed Jack set out, bearing
a large trunk on his shoulder, and directing
Alonzo to follow him. They proceeded down
to a quay, and went on board a small shallop.
Here, said Jack to the captain, is the
gentleman I spoke to you about, and
delivered
him the trunk; then taking Alonzo
aside, In that trunk, said he, are a few
changes of linen, and here is something to
help you till you can help yourself. So
saying
,
he slipped ten guineas into his hand.
Haventon expressed his gratitude with tears.
Say nothing, replied the generous tar; we
were born to help each other when in distress;
and may Jack Brown never weather a storm,
or splice a rope in the day of battle, if he
permits a fellow-creature to suffer with want,
while he has a luncheon on board. He then
shook Alonzo by the hand, wishing him a
good voyage, and went whistling away. The
shallop soon sailed, and the next morning
reached Calais.
Alonzo proceeded immediately to Paris,
not with a view of returning to America; he
had yet no relish for revisiting the land of
his sorrows, the scenes where at every step
his heart must bleed afresh, though to bleed
it had never ceased. But he was friendless
in a foreign country: perhaps through the aid
of the American minister, Dr. Franklin, to
whose fame Haventon was no stranger, he
might be placed in a situation to procure
bread, which was all he at present hoped or
wished.
He therefore presented himself before the
Doctor, whom he found alone. To be
informed
that he was an American and
unfortunate
,
was sufficient to arouse the feelings of
Franklin. He desired Haventon to be
seated
,
and to recite his history. This he
readily
complied with, not concealing his
attachment
to Melissa, her father's barbarity, her
death in consequence, his own father's failure,
with all the particulars of his leaving
America
,
his capture, escape from prison and
arrival
in France, as also the town of his
nativity
,
the name of his father, and the
particular
circumstances of his family; concluding
by expressing his unconquerable reluctance to
return to his native country, which now
would be to him but a gloomy wilderness, and
that his present object was only some means
of support.
VOL. II. P
The Doctor inquired of Alonzo the
particular
circumstances and time of his father's
misfortune. Of this he gave a minute
account
.
Franklin sat in deep contemplation
for the space of several minutes. He then
took his pen, wrote a short note, sealed it,
and gave it to Haventon: Deliver this,
said he, according to its direction, and you
will find employment until something more
favourable may offer.
Alonzo took the paper, thanked the Doctor,
and went in search of the person to whom it
was addressed. He soon found the house,
which was situate in one of the most
popular
streets in Paris. He knocked at the
door; it was opened by an elderly man:
Alonzo inquired for the name to whom the
note was directed; the gentleman said that
he himself was the person. Haventon
presented
the note, which having read, the man
invited him to walk in, and ordered supper.
After it was over, he informed Alonzo that
he was an English bookseller, and should
employ him as a clerk, and desired to
know what wages he demanded. Haventon
replied
he should submit that to him, being
unacquainted
with the customary salaries of clerks
in that line of business. The gentleman
observed
that the matter should be arranged the
ensuing day. His name was Grafton.
The next morning Mr. Grafton took
Alonzo
into his bookstore, and gave him
instructions
;
his business was to sell books to
customers
,
and a list of prices was presented
him for the purpose. Mr. Grafton counted
out fifty crowns and gave them to Alonzo:
You may want some necessaries, said he,
and as you have set no price on your services,
we shall not differ about the wages, if you
are attentive and faithful.
He gave his employer no room to
complain
;
nor had he any reason to be
discontented
with his situation. Mr. Grafton
regularly
advanced him fifty crowns at the
commencement
of every month, and boarded
him in his family. Haventon dressed
himself
in deep mourning: he sought no
company
;
he found consolation only in solitude, if
consolation it could be named.
Walking out early one morning, he
perceived
something lying in the street, which he
at first supposed to be a small piece of silk;
he took it up, and found it to be a curiously
wrought purse, containing a few guineas,
with some small pieces of silver, and
something
at the bottom carefully wrapped in a
piece of gilt paper; he unfolded it, and was
thunderstruck at beholding an elegant
miniature
of Melissa! her sweetly pensive features,
her expressive countenance, her
soul-enlivening
eye! The shock was almost too powerful
for his senses. Wildered in a maze of
wonders
,
he knew not what to conjecture.
Melissa's
miniature found in the streets of Paris,
after she had been sometime dead! He
viewed
it, he clasped it to his bosom. Such,
said he, did she appear, ere the corroding
cankers of grief had blighted her heavenly
charms, or the withering hand of sorrow had
impressed her celestial features! By what
providential miracle am I possessed of the
likeness, when the original is mouldered into
dust? What benevolent angel has taken pity
on my sufferings, and conveyed me this
invaluable
,
inestimable prize?
But though he had thus obtained that
which he esteemed above all earthly
objects
,
what right had he to withhold it
from the real owner, could the owner
indeed
be found? Perhaps the person who lost
it would part with it; possibly the money
contained in the purse was of more value to
that person than the miniature. At any rate,
justice required that he should, if possible,
discover to whom it belonged; this he might
do by advertising, which he immediately
concluded
upon, resolving, should any one
appear
as claimant, to purchase it if within his
power.
Passing into another street, he saw several
handbills posted on the walls of houses;
stepping
up to one, he read as follows:
LOST, between the hours of 9 and
10
last evening, in the
Reu de Loire,
a small silk
purse, containing a few pieces of money, and
a Lady's Miniature
.
One Hundred Crowns
will be given to the person who may have found
it, and will return the miniature only, to the
owner, at the
American Hotel,
near the
Louvre,
Room No.
4.
It was printed both in the French and
English
languages. By the reward here offered,
Alonzo was convinced that the miniature
belonged
to some person who set a value upon
it. Determined to explicate the mystery, he
VOL. II. P 2
proceeded immediately to the place, found
the room mentioned in the bill, and knocked
at the door. A servant appeared, of whom
he inquired for the lodger; the man
answered
him in French, which Haventon did not
understand; he replied in his own language,
but found it was unintelligible to the servant.
A grave, middle-aged gentleman then came
to the door from within the room, and ended
their chattering; he, in the English language,
desired Alonzo to walk in. It was an
apartment
neatly furnished; no person was therein,
except the gentleman, the servant before
mentioned
,
and a person who sat writing in a
corner
of the room, with his back towards them.
Haventon observed that he had called
according
to the direction in a bill of advertisement,
to inquire for the person who the preceding
night had lost a purse and miniature. The
gentleman who was writing had hitherto taken
no notice of what passed; but at the sound
of Alonzo's voice, after he had entered the
room, he started and turned around, and on
mention of the miniature, he rose up.
Haventon
fixed his eyes upon him; they both stood
a few moments silent; for a short time their
recollection was confused and imperfect, but
the mists of doubt were soon dissipated
Bloomfield!Haventon!they
alternately
exclaimed. It was indeed Edgar, the
early friend and fellow-student of Alonzo
the brother of Melissa! In an instant they
were in each other's arms.
They retired to a separate apartment,
equally
anxious for mutual explanation of so
unexpected
a meeting. Edgar informed Alonzo
that the news of Melissa's death reached him
by a letter from his father, while at the army;
that he immediately procured a furlough and
visited his parents, whom he found in
inconsolable
affliction. The letter which my
uncle
had written, said Bloomfield,
announcing
the distressing event, stated with what
patience and placidity she endured her
malady
,
and with what calmness and resignation
she met the approach of death. Her last
moments
,
like her whole life, were unruffled and
serene; she is in Heaven, Alonzoshe is
an angel! Swelling grief prevented his
proceeding; for some time he could say no
more, and Haventon, with a bursting heart
could only mingle his tears.
My father, resumed Bloomfield, at
length, bent on uniting her to Bowman, or at
least on preventing her union with you, had
removed
her to a desolate family mansion, and
placed her under the care of an aunt. At
that place he either suspected or really
discovered
that you had access to her while
her guardian was absent on business. She
was therefore no longer intrusted to the care
of her aunt, but my father immediately
formed
and executed the plan of sending her to
his brother in South Carolina, with the
pretence
of restoring her health, by change of
climate, which in reality had begun seriously
to decline: there it was designed that
Bowman
should shortly follow her, with
recommendations
from my father to our uncle,
urging him to use all possible means which
might tend to persuade her to relinquish all
thoughts of you, and accept the hand of your
rival. But change of climate only increased
her load of sorrows, and she soon perished
beneath them. The letter mentioned nothing
of her mental afflictions; possibly my uncle's
family were not acquainted therewith; to them,
probably, she never disclosed the secrets of
her bosom, but a prey to bitter grief and
melancholy
concealment, sank silently into the
tomb. My father's distress was excessive;
often did he accuse himself of barbarity;
and he once earnestly expressed a wish that
he had consented to her union with you.
Notwithstanding
he is parsimonious, yet he
sincerely
loved his children. Inflexible as is his
nature, the untimely death of a truly
affectionate
and an only daughter, will, I much fear,
precipitate him, and perhaps my mother also,
to a speedy grave.
Soon as my feelings would permit, I
repaired
to the residence of your parents, and
made inquiry concerning you. I found them
easy in their reduced circumstances, except
that your father had been ill, but was
recovering
.
Of you they had heard nothing after
your departure, and they deeply lamented
your absence. From Vincent I could obtain
no farther information.
Sick of the world, I returned to the
army
.
An American ambassador was soon to
sail for Holland; I solicited and obtained
the appointment of secretary, hoping, by
visiting
distant countries, in some measure to
relieve
my mind from the deep melancholy with
which it was oppressed. We were to proceed
first to Paris, where we have been a few days:
tomorrow we depart for Holland. The
minister
is the gentleman who introduced you
into the room where you found me. Last
evening I lost the miniature which I suppose
you have found; the chain to which it was
suspended around my neck, had broken while
I was walking in the street; I carefully
wrapped
it in paper and deposited it in my purse,
which I probably dropped on replacing in my
pocket, and did not discover the loss until
this morning; I immediately made diligent
search, but not finding it, I put up bills of
advertisement. The likeness was taken in
my sister's happiest days: after I had entered
upon my clerical studies in New-York, I
became
acquainted with a miniature-painter, who
took mine; he afterwards went into the
country
,
and as I found he was to pass near
Bloomfield Vale, I engaged him to call there
and take my sister's also; we exchanged
them soon after; it was dear to me even
while the original remained, but since she is
gone it has become a most invaluable relique.
All the affectionate powers of Alonzo's soul
were called into action by Edgar's recital.
The days of other yearsthe ghost of
sepulchred
blessings, passed in painful review.
Added to these, the indigent circumstances
of his parents, his father's recent illness, and
his probable inability to procure even the
common
necessaries of life, all tended more
deeply
to sink his spirits in the gulf of
melancholy
and misery. He however informed
Edgar of all that had happened since they
parted at Vincent's; respecting the old
mansion
,
Melissa's extraordinary disappearance
therefrom, the manner in which he was
informed
of her death, his departure from
America
,
capture, Bowman's death, his own
escape
from prison, arrival in France, and
finding the miniature. To both Edgar and
Alonzo the manner of Melissa's sudden
removal
from the mansion was still
inexplicable
,
though convinced that it was effected by
her aunt or her father.
As Bloomfield was to depart early the next
morning, they neither slept nor separated that
night. If it were not for your reluctance to
revisit your native country, said Edgar,
I should urge you to accompany me to
Holland
,
and thence return with me to America.
Necessity and duty require that I should not
be long absent, as my parents want my
assistance
,
and they are now childless.
Suffer me, answered Haventon, to
bury myself in this city for the present;
should I ever again awake to real life, I will
seek you out if you are on earth, but now
I can only be a companion to my miseries.
The next morning as they were about to
part, Alonzo took Melissa's miniature from
his bosom; he contemplated the picture a few
moments with ardent emotion, and presented
it to Edgar.
Keep it, said Bloomfield, it is thine. I
bestow it upon thee as I would the original,
had not death have become the rival of thy love
and of my affection. Permit not the sacred
symbol too tenderly to renew your sorrows.
How swiftly, Haventon, does this restless
life fleet away! How soon shall we pass the
barriers of terrestrial existence! Let us live
worthy of ourselves, of our holy religion, of
MelissaMelissa, whom, when a few more
suns have arisen and set, we shall meet in
regions
where all tears shall be eternally wiped
from every eye.
With what unspeakable sensibilities was it
returned to the bosom from whence it was
taken!
Edgar offered Alonzo pecuniary assistance,
which the latter refused: I am in business,
said he, which brings me a decent support,
and that is sufficient. They agreed to write
each other as opportunities presented, and
then affectionately parted; Edgar sailed for
Holland, and Alonzo returned to his
employment
at Mr. Grafton's.
Sometime after this Haventon received a
message from Dr. Franklin, requesting him to
call at his house; he instantly obeyed the
summons
;
the Doctor introduced him into his
study
,
and after being seated, Franklin earnestly
surveyed him for some time, and then
addressed
him as follows:
Young man, your views, your resolutions,
and the present course of your conduct, are
totally wrong. Disappointment, you say, has
driven you from your native country.
Disappointment
in what? In obtaining the
object
you most valued. But suppose you had
experienced a completion of your wishes and
expectations; would you then have been
happy
?
Your own reason, if you coolly consult
it, will convince you to the contrary. Do
you not remember, when an infant, how you
VOL. II. Q
cried and teazed your nurse or your parents
for a rattle, or some gay trinket? Your whole
soul was fixed upon the enchanting gewgaw;
but when possessed you soon cast it away;
and sighed as ardently for some other trifle,
some new toy. Thus it is through life; the
fancied value of an object ceases with the
attainment
;
it becomes familiar, and its charm
is lost. Was it the splendours of beauty
which enraptured you? Sickness may, and
age must, destroy the symmetry of the most
finished form, the brilliancy of the finest
features. Was it the graces of intellect? I
tell you that by familiarity these allurements
perish, and the mind left vacant turns to some
other source to supply the vacuum. Stripped
of all but their intrinsic value, how poor,
how vain, how worthless, are those things
we name pleasures and enjoyments!
Besides, the attainment of your wishes
might have been the death of your hopes. If
my reasoning be correct, the ardency of your
passion must have expired with the pursuit
an
every-day
dress, however rich and costly
the texture, is soon soiledon your part,
indifference
would consequently have
succeeded
;
on that of your partner, disappointment,
jealousy and disgust. What might have
followed
is needless for me to name; your soul
must shudder at the idea of conjugal discord
and connubial hostility!
But granting the most favourable
consequences
;
turn the brightest side of the
picture
;
admitting as much happiness as the
marriage state will allow; how might your
bosom have been wounded by the sickness
and death of your children, or their
disorderly
and disobedient conduct! You must know,
also, that the warmth of youthful passion
soon ceases, and it is merely a hazardous
chance whether friendship will supply the
absence of affection. After all, my young
friend, it will be well for you to consider,
whether the all-wise, dispensing hand of
Providence
has not directed this matter, which
you esteem so heavy an affliction, for your
greatest good and most essential advantage.
And permit me to tell you, that in all my
observations
on life, I have always found that
those connexions which were formed from
inordinate passion, or what you would call
pure affection, have been ever the most
unhappy
.
Examine the varied circles of
society
,
you will there see this axiom
demonstrated
;
you will there perceive how few
among the sentimentally refined are even
apparently
at ease, while those insusceptible of
what you term tender attachments, or who
receive them only as things of course, plod
on through life without ever experiencing the
least inconvenience from a want of the
pleasures
they are supposed to bestow, or the
existence
of pains they are sure to create. Beware
then, my son, beware of yielding the heart to
the effeminacies of passion. Exquisite
sensibilities
are ever subject to exquisite inquietudes.
Counsel with correct reason; submit to the
dispensations of Heaven; place entire
dependence
on the
Supreme
, and the triumph of
fortitude and resignation will be yours.
Franklin paused. His reasonings,
howver
they convinced the understanding,
healed
not the wounds of Alonzo's bosom. In
Melissa he looked for as much happiness as
earth could afford, and he perceived no
consoling
hand in life able to repair the loss he
had sustained.
You have, resumed the philosopher,
deserted an indulgent father, a fond and
tender
mother, who must want your aid; now
perhaps unable to toil for bread; now
possibly
laid upon the bed of sickness, calling in
anguish or delirium for the filial hand of their
only child to administer relief. [
All the
parental
affections of Alonzo were now called into
poignant action
.] You have left a country
bleeding at every vein; desolated by the
ravages of war; wrecked by the thunders of
battle; her heroes slain; her children
captured
,
her towns conflagrated. This
country
asks, she demands, you owe her your
services. God and nature call upon you to
defend her, while here you bury yourself in
inglorious inactivity, pining for a hopeless
object, which by all your lamentations you
can never repossess, or bring back to the
regions
of mortality.
This aroused the patriotic flame in the
bosom
of Alonzo, and he involuntarily
exclaimed
,
I will go to the relief of my parentsI
will fly to the defence of my country!
In former days, continued Franklin, I
was well acquainted with your father. Soon
as you informed me of his failure I wrote to
my correspondent in London, and found, as
I suspected, that he had been overreached by
swindlers and sharpers. The pretended
insolvency
VOL. II. Q 2
of the merchants with whom he was
connected
proves to be all a deception, as does also
the reported loss of the ships in their employ.
The merchants fled to England; I have had
them arrested, and they have given up their
effects, to much more than the amount of their
debts. I have therefore procured a restoration
of your father's property, which, with costs,
damages and interests, when legally stated, he
will receive of my agent in Philadelphia, to
whom I shall transmit sufficient documents by
you, and shall advance you a sum equal to the
expences of your voyage, which will be
liquidated
by the said agent. A ship sails in a few
days from Havre for Savannah in Georgia; I
will give you a draft on a house in that city,
upon
which you will receive cash when you
arrive
,
to enable you to prosecute your journey.
It would indeed be more convenient were the
vessel bound to some northern port, but I
know of no other which will sail for any
part of America in some time. On board her
therefore I would advise you to take passage;
it is not very material in what quarter of the
continent you are landed, you will soon reach
Philadelphia, transact your business, restore
your father to his possessions, and be ready
to serve your country.
If any thing could yield Alonzo
consolation
,
it must have been this noble, liberal and
disinterested conduct of the great Franklin, by
which his family were to be placed in ease and
independence. Ah! could this fortunate
event have occurred in time to save a life far
dearer than his own!the reflection was too
painful, too excrutiating for retention. The
idea, however, of affording joy and comfort to
his aged parents hastened his departure.
Furnished
with proper documents and credentials
from his generous benefactor, he took leave of
him with the warmest expressions of
gratitude
,
bade adieu to the family of Mr.
Grafton
,
repaired to Havre, and sailed for
Savannah
.
CHAPTER XV.
And where, thou blest immortal, art thou flown!
Can these deep shades detain thy willing ear!
Canst thou from loaded breezes hear a groan,
Or stain thy spotless mantle with a tear!
Barlow
.
The
ship in which Alonzo embarked was
a merchantman letter of marque,
commanded
and manned by Frenchmen, with American
papers, and sailing under the flag of the
United
States. She carried sixteen guns, and had
a number of passengers on board, of both
sexes, among whom were some entire families,
whose design was to settle in Louisiana; but
besides Haventon there were only three
Americans; Mr. Freeland, concerned in
the cargo of the vessel which consisted of
French dry goods, and his two clerks.
Freeland
was a bachelor of about forty years of
age, a native of Savannah, where for several
years he had been a considerable trader; he
was a person of some information, and the
only one on board with whom Alonzo
formed any intimacy, as the clerks were but
mere youth, neither of them being over
sixteen
years old.
Fine weather and pleasant breezes attended
them across the Atlantic. As they were
armed
only for defence, and as British cruizers
were scouring the ocean, they endeavoured
to shun all large vessels which appeared like
ships of war.
Deeper melancholy impressed the mind of
Haventon as he approached the American
shore. He was returning indeed to his native
land, but to him it was a country widowed
of every joy; a land where his sad
bereavement
would be renewed by every familiar
object
.
One consolation was left him; he came
empowered to restore his parents to affluence;
when he had effected this he determined to
fly to the standard of his country, and to exert
himself in the cause of freedom while his life
or the war should continue.
The morning they came within soundings
a large sail appeared coming off the coast;
she bore down upon them, and soon was
discovered
to be a frigate under English colours;
instantly they set all the canvas their ship
could carry, and put her before the wind,
which happened to be favourable. The
frigate
gave them chase through the day;
towards
evening she came so near as to
commence
a running fire, but with little effect.
Night set in with dark and heavy clouds, and
the wind springing up, they altered their
course and escaped.
A storm came on, which towards midnight
increased to a severe gale. Knowing that
they must be near the coast, and apprehensive
of danger, as the wind blew in shore, they
attempted to lie to, but this the violence of
the gale prevented. They found by casting
the lead that they were rapidly approaching
shoal water; they let go all their anchors, and
lightened the ship by throwing over her guns;
the anchors held her but for a few moments;
the cables parted, and they drove with
amazing
velocity towards land. Consternation
then seized the crew; they saw nothing but
inevitable destruction before them.
Suddenly
she struck upon a reef with tremendous
crash. All was alarm and confusion. The
darkness of the night, the raging of the
wind, the roaring of the sea, mingled with the
despairing cries of men, women and
children
,
formed a scene beyond description
terrible
.
The masts were all carried away. As
a last resort they hoisted out the long boat,
which was immediately stove to pieces against
the sides of the vessel; the only remaining
boat was let down with more caution; the
people inconsiderately rushed in, and in a
moment were buried with it beneath the
waves. Instantly a general and an agonizing
screech announced the parting of the ship,
and human voices ceased to wail.
Haventon with the rest sank in the deep,
but in struggling with the billows caught hold
of a broken spar. His mind was collected.
He saw himself upon the verge of eternity,
just entering the world of spirits. Pardon,
Great God! he exclaimed, all the failings,
all the errors of thy creature, and receive him
to thy mercy. My parents! could I have first
restored thembut thy Almighty will be done.
I shall now meet my Melissa. He was
hurried
swiftly along, sometimes floating on
liquid
mountains, then buried in their
suffocating
bosoms, till on the receding of a
stupendous
billow he found himself resting on
land.
He attempted to rise, but was unable; he
therefore crawled as far as his strength would
permit; and the rage of the returning wave
expired at his feet, by which he judged he
was now beyond the fury of the sea: by
seizing
hold of small shrubbery, he drew himself
up a little eminence, and soon by exertion
recovered the use of his limbs. He fell upon
his knees and returned thanks to that Power,
in whose hands are the destinies of life, and
who had preserved him through so dreadful
a catastrophe.
Day began to break; the violence of the
storm had abated, but the sea was still in
terrible
commotion. Alonzo walked along the
shore, where at every step the scattered
fragments
of the ship were mingled with the
dead bodies of his late companions. He
contemplated
the awful scene with feelings of the
most poignant distress.
Suddenly he was startled by a low, hollow
groan: searching among the dead whence it
proceeded, he discovered a body in which
appeared some symptoms of life, but so
disfigured
with sand and sea-weed that at first he
could not clearly distinguish the features: on a
closer examination he, with mingled emotions
of pleasure and surprise, perceived it to be
Freeland. He drew the body out from among
the filth and rubbish with which it was partially
covered, placed it on a bank, and by constant
and continued friction restored animation; but
it was long before correct sensation returned;
intermitting sighs at length succeeded a
convulsive
struggle, and Freeland opened his
eyes, at first gazing vacantly around him,
then fixing them on Haventon; slowly
recollection
came to his mind; he raised himself
up, and the destructive effects of the
shipwreck
met his sight. All have perished
then, he exclaimed, except ourselves, and
by what miracle are we preserved? By a
miracle indeed, replied Haventon, and
related
the manner in which he had escaped
death.
Freeland informed Alonzo that when the
ship parted he was standing on the
quarter-deck
;
that he clung to the rudder, which
buoyed him up until he was dashed with
great violence against a rock on the shore,
when he lost all sensation.
VOL. II. R
It was with much difficulty, and not
without
the assistance of Haventon, that Freeland
could walk; they however slowly traversed the
shore, searching among the bodies to see if
there were yet any which retained the least
signs of remaining life; but all were cold
and inanimate; all had apparently been long
dead. On casting his eyes around, Freeland
exclaimed, I know this place well; we are
on one of the small islands bordering the coast
of Georgia; I have often been here: about
half a mile inland there is a cluster of houses,
where we can obtain refreshment and
assistance
.
Feeble and exhausted, they set out for the
place and arrived there about noon. The
inhabitants
,
to whom Freeland was known,
received
them with hospitality, and granted
them every aid in their power. The people
assembled and repaired to the coast, where
they buried the dead, and collected such
valuable
fragments of the wreck as had been
cast on shore. The next day Haventon and
Freeland were conveyed to the continent, and
they soon reached Savannah.
Freeland invited Alonzo to his house; it
was managed by servants, and an elderly
man and woman whom he called his
overseers
.
You will make this place your
home, said he to Haventon, so long as it
may suit your convenience. I hope it will be
unnecessary to request you to use the same
freedom as though it was your own. The
latter thanked him, but said that important
business demanded his immediate departure
for the northern states.
You will not, then, said the other, feel
a delicacy in making use of my purse, which,
whatever may be your future prospects, your
present circumstances, occasioned by the late
disastrous events, must render indispensible.
I would with gratitude and pleasure
accept
your generous offer, replied Haventon,
but I have preserved my papers, among
which is a draft upon a mercantile house in
this city which will completely answer all my
purposes.
The documents and credentials which
Alonzo
received from Franklin he had
carefully
wrapped in a piece of oiled seal-skin and
deposited them in his trunk; when the ship
struck, he flew to the trunk, took them out
and placed them in his bosom. If my life
is prolonged, or if not, and my body should be
found, thought he, they may yet reach my
father. The oiled skin resisted the water,
and they were thus preserved.
Intent on his purpose, he immediately
turned
the draft into cash, purchased a carriage,
took a grateful leave of Freeland, and
proceeded
on for Philadelphia. As he
approached
Charleston, his bosom swelled with
mournful
recollection. Near this place, the riches
of his earliest fond hopes, the only earthly
blessing he had ever seriously aspired to
attain
,
lay buried. Here were entombed all the
joys, every comfort his affections could
comprise
:
though hereafter he might find
momentary
consolation, he never could
experience
pleasure or delight, for here had
perished
his felicity, here mouldered Melissa!
He reached the city in the afternoon, and
entered an inn of decent appearance, where
he proposed staying until the next day. He
asked the landlord some questions respecting
the family of Bloomfield; the innkeeper
could give no information on the subject, as
he was but little acquainted in the city, having
recently removed thither from the country.
At evening Alonzo walked out and
wandered
about the city and its environs. He felt
exceedingly anxious to learn something more
particular respecting Melissa's death; but to
whom could he apply? He might easily
inquire
out her uncle; yet what purpose would
this answer, as to approach him comported
not with Haventon's ideas of propriety. Her
uncle had doubtless been made acquainted
with all the particulars of her history, and
had probably acted in concert with her father.
From him therefore Alonzo had nothing to
expect, perhaps not even the common
courtesies
due to strangers; but he experienced
an extreme reluctance to leave Charleston
without obtaining some information relative
to the last moments of Melissa. Ah! he
silently ejaculated, could I but find the
place where her remains are deposited, that
I might consecrate it with tears!
In his excursion he passed near the large
burial
ground; involuntarily he paused:
Possibly
,
he sighed, the object of my early
solicitudes
VOL. II. R 2
and lasting lamentations rests here
in this solemn habitation of gloom and
silence
.
He entered a little ale-house which
stood near. An elderly woman and two small
children were all the persons he found in the
hut. After calling for a pint of ale he asked
the old lady if a gentleman by the name of
Bloomfield did not reside in the city: she
informed him that a person of that name
now lived at Bloomfield Hill, about two miles
from town, where he had an elegant country
seat; that he was very rich, and owned a
superb
house in the city, which he occupied
during the winter.
Was there not a young lady, asked
Alonzo, who died in the family about
twenty months ago?
Dear me! said she, Did you know her
then? Yes; there was; and a sweeter or more
handsomer lady the sun never shined on.
And then she was so good, so patient in her
sickness. Poor, dear, distressed girl, she
pined away to skin and bone before she died.
She was not Col. Bloomfield's daughter, only
somehow related; she was sickly, and came
here in hopes that a change of air might do
her good. She came from  Good lack!
I can't think of the name of the place; it is
a crabbed name, though.
Connecticut, was it not? said Haventon.
Oh yes; that was it, replied she. Dear
suz! Then you knew her, did you, Sir?
Well; we hav'n't her like left in Charleston,
that we ha'n't. And then there was such ado
at her funeral; five hundred people, I dare
say, and more too, with eight young ladies
for pall-bearers, all dressed in white, with
black ribbons, and all the bells tolling so.
Where was she buried? inquired
Alonzo
.
In the great church-yard right before our
door, she answered; my husband is the
sexton
;
he put up her large, white marble
tomb-stones
;
they are the largest and whitest and
grandest in the whole burying-ground, and so
indeed they ought to be, for never was there
a person who deserved them more.
Tired of the old woman's loquacity, and
with a bosom bursting in anguish, he paid for
his ale without drinking it, bade her good
night, and slowly proceeded to the church-yard.
The moon in meridian glory shone with
solemn, silvery ray, on the consecrated piles
and funereal monuments of the sacred dead;
the wind murmured mournfully among the
weeping-willows; a solitary nightingale

[6]
This bird, though not an inhabitant of the northern
states, is frequently to be met with in Georgia and the
Carolinas.
sang
plaintively in the distant forest, and a
whipperwill
,
Melissa's favourite bird, whistled near
the portico of the church. The large, white
tomb-stones soon caught the eye of
Haventon
;
he approached them with tremulous step,
and with feelings too agitated for
description
.
On the head-stone he read as follows:
SACRED
To the memory of inestimable, departed
Worth;
To unrivalled excellence and virtue,
MISS MELISSA BLOOMFIELD:
Whose remains are deposited here;
And whose ethereal part became a Seraph,
October 26, 1776,
In the 19th year of her age.
Alonzo bent, he kneeled, he prostrated
himself, he clasped the green turf which
inclosed
her grave, he watered it with his
tears, he warmed it with his sighs. Where
art thou, bright beam of heavenly light?
he said. Come to my troubled soul, blest
spirit! come, holy shade! come in all thy
native loveliness, and cheer the bosom of
wretchedness by thy grief-dispersing smile!
On the ray of you evening star descendone
moment leave the celestial regions of glory
leave one moment thy sister beatitudesglide
in intrancing beauty before mewave,
benignly
wave thy white hand, and assuage the
anguish
of despairing sorrow! Alas! in vain
my invocations! A curtain impenetrable is
drawn between me and thee, only to be
dissolved
with the dissolution of nature!
He arose and walked away with hurried
step: suddenly he stopped: Yet, said he,
if spirits departed lose not the power of
recollection
;
if they have knowledge of
passing
events on earth, Melissa cannot have
forgotten
meshe must pity me. He returned
to the grave, he took her miniature from his
bosom, he held it up, and earnestly viewed it
by the moon's pale ray. Ah,
Franklin
!
he exclaimed, where is thy philosophy now!
How tenderly pensive beam her lovely eyes
upon me! How often have I drank delicious
ecstacy from the delicacy of those celestial
charms! How frequently have they taught
me to anticipate superlative and uninterrupted
bliss! Mistaken and delusive hope! [
returning
the miniature to his bosom:] Vain and
presumptuous assurance! There, [pointing
to the grave,] there, behold how my dearest
wishesmy proudest hopesmy fondest
expectations
are realized!
He stood awhile silent in speechless agony;
then with interrupting sighs he softly
murmured
,
Hallowed turf! lie lightly on her bosom!
Sacred willows! sprinkle the dews gently
over her tomb, while the moaning breezes
sigh sadly amidst your branches! Here let
the `widowed wild-rose' love to bloom, and
the sweet-briar to languish! here may the
first placid beams of morning delight to
linger
;
from hence the mild rays of evening
reluctantly retire! and when the final trump
shall renovate and arouse the sleeping saint;
when on `buoyant step' she soars to glory,
may our meeting spirits join in beatific
transport, and my enraptured ear catch the
first holy whisper of her consecrated lips!
Having thus poured out the effusions of an
overcharged heart, he pensively returned
to the inn, and seated himself in the common
room, in deep contemplation. As usual at
public houses, a number of people were
gathered there, among whom were several
officers of the American army. Haventon
was too deeply involved in melancholy
reflection
,
to notice passing incidents, until a young
officer took a seat near him, and entered into
conversation respecting the events of the
war. His person was interesting, his
address
sprightly, his observations correct.
Alonzo was in some degree aroused from his
abstraction; the manners of the stranger
pleased him. His frankness, his ease, his
understanding, his urbanity, void of
arrogance
or pedantry, spontaneously attracted
the respect and esteem of Haventon, and he
even felt a sort of solemn regret when the
stranger departed. He soon retired to bed,
determining to proceed on early in the
morning
.
He arose about daylight; the horizon was
overcast; it soon began to rain, and before
sunrise a heavy storm set in. He found
therefore
that he must content himself to stay
until
it was over, which did not happen till near
night, and too late to pursue his journey.
He was informed by the innkeeper, that the
theatre, which had been closed since the
commencement
of the war, was to be opened for
that night only, with the tragedy of
Gustavus
,
and close with a representation of Burgoyne's
capture, and some other recent events of the
American war. To `wing the minutes with
swifter speed,' he determined to go to the
theatre, and at the hour appointed repaired
thither. As he was advancing along the aisle
he passed a box where sat the young officer,
whose manners had so prepossessed him the
preceding evening, at the inn; they
recognized
each other, exchanged salutations,
and Alonzo walked on and took his seat.
The evening was warm, and the house
exceedingly
crowded. When the tragedy was
concluded, and before the after-piece
commenced
,
the officer came to Haventon's
box, and made some remarks on the merits of
the actors. While they were discoursing, a
bustle took place in one part of the house, and
several people gathered around a box, a little
distance from them. The stranger turned, left
Alonzo, and hastened to the place. To the
general inquiry of what's the matter, it
was answered that a lady had fainted. She
was led out, and the tumult subsided.
Soon as the representation closed,
Haventon
returned to the inn. As he passed along
he cast his eyes towards the church-yard,
where lay the `withered blessings of his
dearest joys.' Affection, passion, inclination,
urged him to go and breathe a farewell sigh,
to drop a final tear over the tomb of Melissa;
discretion, reason, wisdom, forbade itforbade
that he should repierce the ten thousand
wounds of his bosom, by the acute revival of
unavailing sorrows.He hurried to his
chamber
.
As he prepared to retire to rest, he saw a
book lying on the table near his bed. On
taking it up, he found it to be
Young's Night
Thoughts;
a volume which in happier days
had been the solace of many a gloomy, many
a lucid hour. He opened it, and the first
lines he cast his eyes upon were the
following
:
VOL. II. S
Song, beauty, youth, love, virtue, joy! this group
Of bright ideasflowers of Paradise,
As yet unforfeit! in one blaze we bind,
Kneel, and present it to the skies; as all
We guess of Heaven! And
these
were all her own,
And she was mine, and I was
was
most blest
Like blossom'd trees o'erturn'd by vernal storm,
Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay
Ye that e'er lost an angel, pity me!
His tears fell fast upon the page; he
replaced
the book, and flung himself into bed.
Sleep was far from him; he closed not his
eyes till dawning light broke from the east;
he then fell into interrupted slumbers.
When he awoke, the morning was
considerably
advanced. He arose. One consolation
was yet leftto see his parents happy. He
went down to order his carriage: his
favourite
stranger, the young officer, was in waiting,
and requested a private interview. They
immediately retired to a separate room, and
the stranger thus addressed him.
From our short acquaintance, Sir, you
may consider it singular that I should attempt
to scrutinize your private concerns; more
extraordinary may you esteem it, when I
inform
you of my reasons for so doing.
Judging
however from appearances, I have no
doubt of your candour; if my questions
should be deemed improper, you will have the
goodness to tell me so.
Alonzo assured him he would treat him
candidly.
This I believe, said the officer; I
therefore take the liberty to ask if you are an
American.
I am, answered Haventon.
I presume, added the strangerthe
question is a delicate oneI presumeyour
family is respectable?
Sacredly so, Sir, replied Alonzo.
Are you unmarried, Sir?
I am now, and have ever been single.
Have you any prospects of connecting in
marriage?
I have not, Sir.
I may then safely proceed, continued
the officer: I trust you will hear me
attentively
,
judge maturely, and decide discreetly.
At any rate, I am confident you will answer
me sincerely.
A young lady of this city, with whom I
am well acquainted, and on terms of the most
intimate friendship; whose father is affluent,
and her connexions eminently respectable;
whose manners are engaging, whose mind is
virtue, whose elegance of form, and personal
beauty, defy competition, is the cause, sir, of
this mission. Early introduced into the higher
walks of life, she has passed the rounds of
fashionable company: many suitors have
sighed
for her hand, whom she complaisantly
dismissed
,
without disobliging, as her heart had
not yet been touched by the tender passion of
love. Surprising as it may however seem, it is
now about six months since she saw in a
dream, the youth who possessed the power to
inspire her with this passion. In her dream
she saw a young gentleman whose manners
and appearance interested her so deeply
as to render her unhappy. She thought he
endeavoured
to obtain an interview with her,
but that some invisible power prevented it. It
seemed that if they could but converse
together
,
it would ensure their felicity. At
length he approached, and just as he was
about to address her, she awoke.
This extraordinary vision she has
communicated
to several of her acquaintance.
Confident that she should at some future time
meet with the real person whose semblance
she had thus seen, her mind has never since
been perfectly at ease. Her father, who has
but one child besides herself, being
extremely
fond of her, has promised that if ever
this unknown stranger should appear to claim
her hand, he will not oppose their union,
provided
he is respectable, and that if worthy of
her choice, he will make him independent.
On my return from the inn the evening I first
saw you, I told my cousinI beg pardon,
SirI was wandering from my subject
After
I first met you at the inn, I fell in
company
with the lady, and in a rallying way, told
her I had seen her
invisible
beau, as we used
to style the visionary gentleman. I
superficially
described your person, and descanted a
little on the embellishments of your mind.
She listened with some curiosity and
attention
;
but I had so often jested with her in
VOL. II. S 2
this manner, that she thought but little of it.
At the play last night, I had just been
conversing
with her when I came to your box;
her eyes followed me, but no sooner had they
rested on you, than she fainted! This was
the cause of my leaving you so abruptly, and
not returning. According to her request,
we conveyed her immediately home, when
she informed me that you was the person
she had seen in her dream! To me only, as
her most trusty friend, she disclosed the
circumstance
.
Even her father and mother are
not informed of it, and should my mission
prove unsuccessful, I shall rest satisfied that
our confidence has been honourably reposed,
and is most securely deposited.
Now, Sir, is it necessary for me farther to
explain? Singular as the facts which I
have related may be considered by you, to
me they must appear as strange. One
valuable
purpose is however answered thereby; it
will exclude the imputation of capriciousness
the freakish whim of
love at first sight
, which
exists only in novels and romances. You, sir,
are young, unmarried, unaffianced, your
affections
free. Such are the circumstances of the
lady. She inquires not into the state of your
property: she asks not riches. If she obtain the
object of her choice, on him, as I have told you,
will her father bestow affluence. Whatever,
Sir, may be your pretensions to eminence,
and they may be many, the lady is not your
inferior. Her education also is such as would
do honour to a gentleman of taste. I will not
extend my remarks: you perfectly understand
meWhat answer shall I return?
Alonzo sighed: for a few moments he was
silent. So sudden, so unexpected was this
singular and extraordinary proposition, that
though not indecisive as to an answer, he
scarcely knew how to frame his reply.
Perhaps, said the stranger, you may
view the manner of this message as bearing
the appearance of indecorum. If so, I
presume
that on reviewing the incidents which led
towhich induced it, as the most safeas
indeed
the only proper means of communication,
you will change your opinion. Probably you
would not wish finally to decide until you
have visited the lady. This was my
expectation
,
and I am therefore ready to introduce
you to her presence.
No, Sir, replied Haventon, so far
from considering the message indecorous, I
esteem and receive it as a mark of peculiar
distinction both as it respects the lady and
yourself; nor is it necessary that I should
visit her to confirm the truth of what you
have related. You will not, Sir, receive it
as a compliment when I say that although
our acquaintance has been short, yet my
confidence
in your honour and integrity is such
as to require no corroborating facts to
establish
your declaration. But, Sir, there are
obstacles, insuperable obstacles to the
execution
of the measures you would propose.
Your frankness to me demands on my part
equal sincerity. I assured you that I was
unmarried, and had no prospect of entering
into matrimonial alliances; this is indeed
the fact; but it is also true that my affections
my first, my earliest affections were
engaged
,
inalienably engaged, to an object which
is now no more. Perhaps you may esteem it
singular; possibly you will consider it
enthusiasm
;
but, Sir, it is impossible that my heart
should admit a second and similar
impression
.
The stranger pausedRecent
disappointments
of this nature, he replied,
commonly
leave the mind under such gloomy
influences
;
time, however, the soother of
severest
woes, will, though slowly, yet surely,
disperse those clouds of anguish, and the rays
of consolation and tranquility again beam
upon the soul. I wish not to be considered
importunate, but the day may arrive when
you will change your present determination,
and then must you not regret that you
rejected
so advantageous an overture?
That day can never arrive, Sir,
answered
Alonzo. I have had time for
deliberate
reflection since the melancholy event
occurred; I have experienced a sufficient
change of objects and of country; the effect
is the same, the wound is still recent, and so
it will ever remain: indeed I cannot wish it
otherwise: there is a rich and sacred
solemnity
in my sorrows, Sir, which I would not
exchange for the most splendid acquirements
of wealth, the most dignified titles of fame, or
the most alluring blandishments of pleasure.
The young officer sat for some minutes
silent
.
Well, Sir, he said; since it is thus;
seeing that these things are so; I will urge
you no farther. You will pardon me
respecting
the part I have taken in this business, as
it was certainly with the purest motives. May
comfort and happiness be yet restored to your
bosom.
To you and your fair friend, returned
Haventon, I consider myself under the
highest
obligations. The gratitude I feel can be but
feebly expressed. Believe me, Sir, when I
tell you, and it is all I can do, that though I
am fit only to associate with my afflictions, yet
your ingenuous conduct has left impressions in
my breast which can never be obliterated till
the current of life ceases to flow. The
stranger
held out his hand, which Alonzo ardently
pressed; they were silent, but their eyes spoke
sympathy, and they parted.
Haventon immediately prepared, and was
soon ready to depart. As he was stepping
into his carriage he saw the officer returning;
when he came up, I must intrude a few
moments longer, he said, and will then give
you no farther trouble. You will recollect
that the lady about whom I have so much
teazed you, when she became
acquainted
with
you in her dream believed that if she could
but speak to you, joy and felicity would ensue.
Confident that this indication may comprise
some mystery, for with all her accomplishments
she is a little superstitious, she requests a short
interview. You have nothing to fear, Sir; she
would not for the wealth of worlds yield
you her hand, unless in return you could give
her your heart. Nor was I to inform you that
she made this request, but to introduce you
as by my own invitation. Conscious however
that you would thus far humour the caprice
of a lady, I chose to tell you the truth. She
resides near by, and it will not detain you
long.
It is capriciousness in the extreme,
thought Alonzo; but he assured the stranger
he would accompany him, who immediately
took a seat in the carriage, and they drove by
his direction to an elegant building in a street
at a little distance, and alighted.
As they entered the house, a servant
handed the stranger a note, which he hastily
looked over; Tell the gentleman I will be
with him in a moment, said he to the man,
who instantly withdrew. Turning to
Haventon
,
A person is in waiting, he said, on
urgent business; excuse me therefore if it is
with reluctance I retire a few moments after
having announced you. I will soon be with
you again.
They then ascended a flight of stairs, and
after winding through two or three rooms, the
officer opened the door of a chamberThe
gentleman I mentioned to you, Madam, he
said. Alonzo entered; the officer closed
the door and retired.
The lady was sitting by a window at the
opposite side of the room, but arose as
Haventon
was announced. She was dressed in
sky-blue silk, embroidered with spangled
lace; a gemmed tiara gathered her hair, from
which was suspended a green veil; a purple
silk girdle with diamond clasps surrounded
her waist, and a brilliant sparkled upon her
bosom. The stranger's description was not
exaggerated, thought Alonzo, for except
ONE, I have never seen a more elegant figure,
and he almost wished the veil removed, that
he might behold her features.
You will please to be seated, Sir, she
said. I know not howI feel an
inexpressible
diffidence in making an excuse for the
inconveniences my silly caprices have given
you.
Enchanting melody was in her voice!
Alonzo
knew not why, but it thrilled his bosom,
electrified his soul, and vibrated every nerve
of his heart! Confused and hurried
sensations
,
melancholy, yet pleasing, transporting
as the recurrence of youthful joys,
enrapturing
as dreams of early childhood, passed in
rapid succession over his recollection. She
advanced towards him and turned aside her
veil. Her eyes were suffused; tears
streamed
down her cheeks. Alonzo startedhis
whole frame shookhe gasped for breath
Melissa!he convulsively exclaimed
God of infinite wonders!It is
Melissa
!
VOL. II. I
CHAPTER XVI.
Thus, over the storm, and in glory on high,
The peaceable rainbow encircles the sky,
Looks abroad on the world, while the thunder retires,
The tempest subsides and the whirlwind expires;
In beauty sublime all creation is drest,
And the music of summer lulls nature to rest.
Darby
.
Again
will the incidents of our history
produce a pause. Our sentimental readers
will experience a recurrence of sympathetic
sensibilities, and attend more eagerly to the
final scene of our drama. Melissa alive?
may they say; Impossible! Did not Alonzo
see her death announced in the public prints?
Did not her cousin at New-London inform
him of the circumstance, and was he not in
mourning? Did not the dying Bowman
confirm
the melancholy event? And was not the
unquestionable testimony of her brother
Edgar
sufficient to establish the fact? Did
not the sexton's wife, who knew not
Haventon
,
corroborate it? And did not Alonzo
himself finally read her name, her age, and
the time of her death, on her tomb-stone,
which exactly accorded with the publication in
the papers, and his own knowledge of her age?
And is not all this competent to prove, clearly
and incontestibly prove, that she is dead! And
yet, here she is again, in all her primitive
beauty
and splendour! No; this surely can never
be. However the author may succeed in
description
;
in painting inanimate nature, he is
no magician; or if he is, he cannot raise the
dead. Melissa has long since mouldered into
dust, and he has conjured up some
female
Martin
Guerre, or Thomas Hoag
[7]
[7]
These were men who in countenance, stature,
voice and manners, so nearly resembled some other
persons that their own wives could not discriminate
between them. One of these instances, that of Hoag,
occurred in the city of New-York; the other in
England
.
some person
from whose near resemblance to the deceased
he thinks to impose upon us, and upon
Haventon
also, for Melissa. But it will not do;
it must be the identical Melissa herself, or it
might as well be her likeness in a marble
statue
.
What! Can Alonzo realize the
delicacies
,
the tenderness, the blandishments, of
Melissa in another? Can her substitute point
him to the rock on New-London beach, the
bower on her favourite hill, or so feelingly
describe the charms of nature! Can he
indeed
realize in her representative those
alluring
graces, that pensive sweetness, those
unrivalled
virtues and that matchless worth, which
he found in her, and which attracted, fixed and
secured the youngest affections of his soul?
Impossible! Or could the author even make
it out that Alonzo was deceived by a person
so nearly resembling Melissa, that the
difference
could not be distinguished, yet to his
readers
he must unveil the deception, and of course
the story will end in disappointment; it will
leave an unpleasant and disagreeable
impression
on the mind, which in novel writing is
certainly wrong. It is proved, as clearly as
facts can prove, that he has permitted
Melissa
to die, and since she is dead, it is totally
beyond his power to bring her to lifeand so
his history is intrinsically
good for nothing
.
Be not quite so hasty, my zealous
censor
.
Did we not tell you that we were detailing
facts? that we held the pencil of nature?
that our portraits were true to life? Shall we
disguise or discolour truth to please
your
taste?
Have we not told you that disappointments
are the lot of life, the inseparable attendants
of man? Have we not, according to the
advice
of the moralist, led Alonzo to the
temple
of philosophy, the shrine of reason, and
the sanctuary of religion? If all these fail;
if in them he cannot find a balsam sufficient
to heal his wounded bosom, then, if in
despite
of graves and tomb-stones, Melissa
will
come to his relief; will pour the balm of
consolation over his anguished soul, cynical
critic, can the author help it?
It was indeed Melissa, the identical
Melissa
,
whom Alonzo ascended a tree to catch
a last view of, as she walked up the avenue
to the old mansion, after they parted at the
draw-bridge, on the morning of the day when
she was so mysteriously removed.
Melissa
!Alonzo!
were
all they could
articulate
,
and frown not, my fair readers, if
we tell you that she was instantly in his arms,
while he pressed his ardent lips to her
glowing
cheek! Sneer not, ye callous hearted
insensibles
,
ye fastidious prudes, if we inform
you that their tears fell in one immingling
shower; that their sighs wafted in one
blended
breeze.
VOL. II. T 2
The sudden opening of the door aroused
them to a sense of their improper situation
for who but must consider it
improper
to find
a young lady locked in the arms of a
gentleman
to whom she had just been introduced!
The opening of the door therefore caused
them quickly to change their
position;
not so
hastily however but that the young officer,
who then entered the room, had a glimpse of
it. Aha! said he, Have I caught you!
Is my philosophic Plato so soon
metamorphosed
to a
bon ton
enamarato? But a few
hours ago, Sir, and you were proof against
the whole arcana of beauty, and all the
artillery
of the graces; but no sooner are you for
one moment
tete a tete
with a fashionable belle,
than your heroism and your resolutions are
vanquished, your former ties dissolved, and
your
deceased
charmer totally forgotten or
neglected, by the virtue of a single glance.
Well; so it is
Amor vincit omnia
, is my
motto
;
to thee, all-conquering beauty, our firmest
determinations must yield. I cannot censure
you for discovering, though late, that one
living object is really of more intrinsic value
than two dead ones. Indeed, Sir, I must
really applaud your discrimination and
discernment
.
The laws of honour, said Alonzo,
smiling
,
compel me to submit to your raillery
and deceptionI am in your power, Sir.
I acknowledge, returned the officer,
that I have a little deceived you; my story
was fiction founded on truththe true novel,
or lover style. But for the deceptive part,
you may thank your little gipsy of a nymph
there, (pointing to Melissa;) she planned
and I executed.
How ready you gentlemen are, replied
Melissa, when accused of impropriety, to
cast the blame on the defenceless! So it was
in the beginning, and so it is still. But you
must remember that Alonzo has yet to hear
my story; there, Sir, I have the advantage
of you.
There, I confess, said he, looking at
Haventon, you will be too hard for me, and
so I will dismiss the subject.
Melissa then introduced the young officer
to Alonzo by the appellation of Captain
Wilmot
.
He is the son of a deceased uncle,
said she; a cousin to whom I am much
indebted
,
as you shall hereafter know.
A coach drove up to the door. We must
prepare for a short ride, said Wilmot to
Haventon
;
this is our uncle's house in town,
where he resides in winter, but in summer
is kept by his steward. We chose it for the
scene of our late comedy. I will now
introduce
you to Col. Bloomfield at his villa, about
two miles from the city; you will have no
objection to breakfast with us there, if it be
only to keep our cousin Melissa in
countenance
.
Haventon did not hesitate to accept the
invitation; they immediately therefore
entered
the coach, a servant took charge of
Alonzo's carriage, and they drove to the
country seat of Col. Bloomfield, who with his
family received Alonzo with much friendship
and politeness. Wilmot had apprized them
of Haventon's arrival in town, and of course
he was expected.
Col. Bloomfield was about fifty years old;
his manners were majestically grave and
commanding
,
yet polished and polite. He was
a member of the state legislature, and
Colonel
of the city guards, which stations he had
held for several years. His family consisted
of an amiable wife considerably younger than
himself, and two sons; the eldest about ten
years of age, the other seven. Harmony
and cheerfulness reigned in this family, which
diffused tranquility and ease to all its
members
and its guests.
It was agreed that Alonzo should pass a
few days at the house of Melissa's uncle,
when she was to accompany him to
Connecticut
.
Capt. Wilmot, with some other officers,
was recruiting for the army, where his
regiment
then lay, and which he was shortly to
rejoin
.
He could not therefore be constantly at
his uncle's, though he was principally there
while Haventon stayed, but being absent the
day after the latter arrived, Melissa and
Alonzo
having retired to a room separate from the
family, she gave him the following account of
what happened after they parted at the old
mansion.
The morning after you left me, she said,
Jeffrey came there early and called to be
let in; I immediately went to the gate,
opened
it, and let down the bridge. He informed
me my aunt had suddenly and
unexpectedly
returned that morning, in company with
a strange gentleman, and had sent him for the
keys, as she intended to visit me immediately.
I endeavoured to persuade him to leave the
keys in my possession, engaging to make
all easy with my aunt when she arrived. This,
though with much reluctance, he at length
consented to, and departed. Soon after aunt
Martha came herself, and without much
ceremony
,
demanded the keys, insinuating that I
had obtained them from Jeffrey by imposition,
and for dishonourable purposes. This
aroused
my spirit, and I answered by assuring
her that whatever purposes persecution and
cruelty had compelled me to adopt, my
conscience
,
under present circumstances,
approved
them, and I refused to give her the keys.
She then ordered me to prepare to leave the
mansion, and accompany her to her residence
at the house of Jeffrey. I told her that as I
had been placed there by my father, I should
not consent to a removal unless by his express
orders. She instantly left me, declaring
she would soon let me know her authority
was not thus to be trampled upon with
impunity
.
I immediately raised the bridge and made
fast the gate, determining they should so
remain
until evening. The day passed away
without other occurrence worthy of note, and
soon as it was dark, I opened the gate, and
cautiously let down the bridge, then
returned
to the building, and placed a candle, as
we had concerted, at the window. Shortly
after I heard a carriage roll over the bridge
and proceed up the avenue. My heart
fluttered
;
I wishedI hardly knew what I did
wish, but I feared I was about to act
improperly
,
having no other idea but that it was you,
Alonzo, who was approaching. The carriage
stopped near the door, a footstep ascended
the stairs; judge of my surprise and
agitation
when my father entered the chamber!
A maid, and two men servants, followed him.
He directed me to make immediate
preparations
for leaving the house, which command,
I obeyed with a heart too full for utterance.
Soon as I was ready we entered the carriage,
which drove rapidly away. As we passed
out of the gate, I looked back at the mansion,
and saw the light of the candle, which I had
forgotten to remove, streaming from the
window
,
and it was by an extraordinary effort
that I prevented myself from fainting.
The carriage proceeded as near as I could
judge about ten miles, when we halted at an
inn for the night, except my father, who
returned
home on horseback, leaving me at the
inn in company with the servants, where the
carriage also remained. The maid was a
person who had been attached to me from my
infancy. I asked her whether she could
explain
these mysterious proceedings. `All I
know, Miss, I will tell you,' said she: `your
father received a letter to-day from Miss
Martha, which put him in a terrible fluster;
he immediately ordered his carriage and
directed
us to attend him; he met your aunt at
a tavern somewhere away back, and she told
him that the gentleman who used to come to
our house so much once, had planned to
carry
you off from the place where you lived
with her; so your father concluded to send
you to your uncle's in Carolina, and said I
must go with you; and to tell you the truth
Miss, I was not displeased with it, for your
father
has grown so sour of late that we have
little
peace in the house.' By this I found that
my fate was fixed, and I gave myself up for
some time to unavailing sorrow. The maid
informed me that my mother was well, which
was one sweet consolation among my many
troubles; whether my father had apprized
her of his intention to remove me, the maid
could not tell.
The next morning we pursued our
journey
,
and I was hurried on by rapid stages
until
we reached the Chesapeak, where with the
maid and one man servant I was put on board
a packet for Charleston, at which place we
arrived in due time. My uncle with his
family
received me with much tenderness; the
servant delivered him a package of letters
from my father. The carriage with one
servant
had returned from the Chesapeak to
Connecticut. The maid and the other
servant
experiencing ill health, and not liking
the country, returned home in about two
months.
My father had but one brother and two
sisters; my uncle here is the youngest of the
family. One of my aunts, she who was my
protectress
at the old mansion, you have seen;
the other was the mother of Wilmot; she
married very young to a gentleman in
Hartford
,
of that name, who fell before the walls
of Louisbourg, in the old French war; his
lady did not long survive him; her health,
VOL. II. U
which had been for some time declining,
received
so serious a shock by this catastrophe,
that she died a few months after the
melancholy
tidings arrived, leaving their only child,
then an infant, whom they named Alfred, to
the protection of his relations, who, when
he arrived at a suitable age, placed him at
school.
My grandfather, who had the principal
management of Mr. Wilmot's estate, sent my
uncle, then young and unmarried, to
Hartford
for the purpose of transacting the
necessary
business: there he became acquainted
with and addressed a young lady eminent for
beauty and loveliness, but without fortune,
the daughter of a poor mechanic. His father
when informed of this attachment, in a very
peremptory manner, ordered him to break off
the connexion on pain of his highest
displeasure
.
But such is the force of early
impressions
,
[
Melissa sighed
,] that he found it
impossible
to submit to these stern injunctions;
a clandestine marriage ensued, and my
grandfather's
maledictions in consequence. The
union was however soon dissolved; my
uncle's lady died in about twelve months
after their marriage, and shortly after the birth
of their first child, which was a daughter.
Inconsolable and comfortless, he put the child
out to nurse, and travelled to the south.
After
wandering about for some time, he took
up his residence in Charleston, where he
amassed a splendid fortune. He finally
married
an amiable and respectable woman,
whose tenderness, though it did not entirely
remove, yet greatly alleviated the pangs of
early sorrow, and this, added to the little
blandishments of a young family, fixed him
in a state of more contentedness than he once
ever expected to experience. His daughter,
by his first wife, when she became of proper
age, was placed at an eminent boarding-school,
where she remained until within about two
years before I came here, when her father
sent and brought her home. She it was who,
as I once informed you, I expected to pass the
summer with me at Bloomfield Vale, but ill
health prevented her visit. Alfred was
educated
at Harvard College; after having
graduated
he came to this place on our uncle's
request
,
and has since remained in the family.
Soon after I arrived here my uncle came
into my chamber one day, `Melissa,' said he,
`I find by your father's letters that he
considers
you to have formed an improper
attachment
;
I wish you to give me a true
statement
of the matter, and if any thing can be
done to effect a reconciliation, you may
depend
upon my assistance. I have seen some
troubles in this way myself, in early days;
perhaps my counsel may be of service.'
I immediately gave a correct account of
every particular circumstance from the time
of my first acquaintance with you until my
arrival at his house. He sat some time silent,
and then told me that my father, he believed,
had drawn the worst side of the picture; that
he had urged him to exert every means in his
power to reclaim me to obedience; that
Bowman
was to follow me within a few months,
and that if I still refused to yield him my
hand, my father positively and solemnly
declared
he would discard me for ever, and
strenuously enjoined it upon him to do the
same. `I well know my brother's temper,'
continued he; `the case is difficult, but
something
must be done. I shall immediately
write to your father, advising him not to
proceed
too rashly; in the mean time we will
consider what measures to pursue. You must
not, my niece, you must not be sacrificed.'
So saying, he left me, with the
consolation
that instead of a tyrant I had found a
friend in my new protector.
Alfred was made acquainted with the
affair
,
and many were the plans projected for
my
benefit
, and abandoned as indefeasible,
till an event happened which called forth all
the fortitude of my uncle to support it, and
operated in the end to free me from
persecution
.
My uncle's daughter was of a very
delicate
and sickly constitution, and her health
evidently
decreasing after coming to this place, she
was sent to a village on the high hills of
Santee
,
where she remained some time; she then
went to one of the inland towns in North
Carolina
,
from whence she had but just returned
with Alfred when I arrived. Afterwards I
accompanied her to Georgetown and other
places, attended by her father, so that she was
little more known in Charleston than myself.
But all answered no purpose towards the
restoration
of her health; a confirmed hectic
carried her off in the bloom of youth. I was
but a few months older than she; her name
was
Melissa
, a name which a pious
grandmother
VOL. II. U 2
had borne, and was therefore retained
in the family. Our similarity of age, and in
some measure of appearance; our being so
little known in Charleston, and our names
being
the same, suggested to Alfred the idea of
imposing upon my father by passing off my
cousin's death as my own. This would at least
deter Bowman from prosecuting his intended
journey to this place; it would also give time
for farther deliberation, and might so operate
on my father's feelings as to soften that
obduracy
of temper which deeply disquieted
himself
and others, and thus finally be productive
of happily effecting the desired purpose.
My uncle was too seriously overwhelmed
with grief to be particularly consulted on this
plan. He however intrusted Alfred to act
with full powers, and to use his name for my
interest if necessary. Wilmot therefore
procured
a publication of my cousin's death in
the Connecticut papers, particularly at
New-London
,
the native place of Bowman. In
Charleston it was generally supposed that it
was the niece, and not the daughter of my
uncle
,
who had died; this imposition was likewise
practised on the sexton, who keeps the
register
of deaths. Alfred then wrote a letter to
my father, in my uncle's name, stating the
particulars of my cousin's death, and
applying
them to me. The epitaph on her
tomb-stone
would with equal propriety apply either
to her or to me, as would also the account
of her death in the gazettes.
Confident that the news must reach you,
our next object was to give you correct
information
respecting the facts. I consulted
with Alfred how this might be done. `My
dear cousin,' said he, `I am determined to
see you happy before I relinquish the business
I have undertaken. Letters are a precarious
mode of communication; I will make a
journey
to Connecticut, find out Haventon, visit
your friends, and see how the plan
operates
.
I am known to your father, who has
ever treated me as a relative. I will return
as speedily as possible, and we shall then
know what measures are best next to be
adopted.' I requested him to unfold the
deception
to my mother, and if he found it
expedient
,
to Vincent also and the Berghers, on
whose friendship and confidence I was sure
he might safely rely.
He soon departed, and returned in about
two months. He found my parents in
extreme
distress on account of my supposed
death; my mother's grief had brought her
on the bed of sickness; but when Alfred
undeceived her she rapidly recovered. My
father observed to Wilmot that he seriously
regretted opposing my inclinations, and that
were it possible the steps he had taken could
be retraced he should act in a very different
manner, as he was not only deprived of me,
but of Edgar also, who had gone to Holland
in an official capacity, soon after receiving
the tidings of my death. `I am now
childless
,'
he said, in tears. Alfred's feelings
were moved, and could you then have
been found, he would have disclosed to my
father the facts as they really were; but lest
he should relapse into former prejudices and
austerities, Wilmot dare not reveal to him
the secret.
On inquiring at your father's, at
Vincent's
and at Bergher's, he could learn
nothing
of you, except that you had departed
in search of me. Vincent conjectured you
had gone to New-London, on the supposition
that I might be there. Alfred therefore
determined
to proceed to that place
immediately
.
He then confidentially unfolded the
scheme to your family, to Vincent and the
Berghers, desiring that if you returned you
would repair instantly to Charleston. My
father
was still to be kept in ignorance.
Alfred went on to New-London: by
Glenford he was informed of your interview
with him, but from whence you then came,
or whither you went, he knew not; and after
making the strictest inquiry he could learn
nothing more. By a vessel in that port bound
directly for Holland he wrote an account of
the whole affair to Edgar, mentioning his
unsuccessful
search to find you; he then
returned
to Charleston.
Wilmot was apprized by our friends of the
circumstances which occasioned my sudden
removal from the old mansion. The morning
you left me you were discovered by my aunt
who was passing the road in a chair attended
by a gentleman with whom she had then but
recently become acquainted. They
immediately
drove to Jeffrey's hut; finding that he
had left the keys with me, she sent him for
them, and on my refusing to give them up, she
came herself, as I have before related, but as
she succeeded no better than her messenger,
she returned and secretly despatched an
express
to my father, informing him of the
circumstances
,
adding her suspicions of our
having had an interview, and that from my
refusing to yield the keys, there was little
doubt but we had formed a plan for my
escape. Alarmed at this information, my
father immediately ordered his carriage,
drove to the mansion, and removed me as
previously stated.
But who was the strange gentleman with
your aunt? inquired Alonzo.
This I will also tell you, answered
Melissa
,
though it unfolds a tale which reflects
no great honour on my family.
Hamblin was the name which this man
assumed; he said he had been an eminent
merchant in New-York, and left it about the
time it was taken by the British. He lodged
at an inn where my aunt frequently called
when she was out collecting rents; there he
first introduced himself, and gained her
esteem
by art and insidiousness. He
accompanied
her on visits to the tenants, and assisted
in settling her accounts. He told her that
when the war came on, he turned his effects
into money, which he had with him, and was
now in pursuit of some country place where
he might purchase a residence to remain
during
the war. To make the story short as
possible, he finally so far seduced her
affections
that she accepted his hand, and contrary
to my father's advice, married him; he
shortly
persuaded her to sell her possessions under
pretence of removing to some populous town
and living in style; her property however
was no sooner sold, which my father bought
for ready cash at a low price, than he found
means to realize the money, and absconded.
It was afterwards discovered that his real name
was Brenton; that he had left a wife and
family
in Virginia in indigent circumstances,
where by dissipation he had wasted an ample
fortune inherited from his father, and involved
himself deeply in debt. He had scarcely
time to get off with the booty he swindled
from my aunt, when his creditors from
Virginia
were at his heels. He fled to the
British
at New-York, where he rioted for a few
months, was finally stabbed by a soldier in a
fracas, and died the next day. He was about
thirty-five years old. All these troubles bore
so heavily upon my aunt, that she fell into a
decline, and died about six months ago.
After Alfred returned from Connecticut,
he wrote frequently to Vincent and also to
Bergher, but could obtain no intelligence
concerning
you. It would be needless, Alonzo,
to describe my conjectures, my anxieties, my
feelings! The death of my cousin and aunt
kept me in crape until at the instance of
Wilmot I put it off yesterday morning at my
uncle's house in town, which Alfred
proposed
for the scene of action, after he
discovered
the cause of my fainting at the theatre.
I did not readily come into his plan to deceive
you: `Suffer me,' he said, `to try the
constancy
of your
Leander;
I much doubt whether
he would swim the Hellespont for you.' This
aroused my pride and confidence, and I
permitted
him to proceed.
Alonzo then gave Melissa a minute account
of all the events he had experienced from the
time of their separation until he met with her
the preceding day. At the mention of
Bowman's
fate, Melissa sighed; With how
many
vain fears, said she, was I perplexed,
lest by some means he should discover my
existence and place of residence, after he,
alas! was silent in the tomb! Alonzo
farther told her that he received a letter
from Edgar after his arrival in Holland, and
that he wrote him an answer just as he left
Paris, informing him of his reasons for
returning
to America.
When the time arrived that Haventon and
Miss Bloomfield were to set out for
Connecticut
,
Melissa's uncle and Alfred
accompanied
them to Georgetown, where an
affectionate
parting took place; the latter returned
to Charleston, and the former proceeded on
their journey.
Philadelphia was then in possession of the
British troops. Alonzo found Dr. Franklin's
agent at Chester, transacted his business,
went on, arrived at Vincent's, where he left
Melissa, and repaired immediately to his
father's.
Their friends were most joyfully surprised
at their arrival. Melissa's mother was sent
for to Vincent's; let imagination paint the
VOL. II. X
meeting! As yet however they were not
prepared to undeceive her father.
Haventon found his parents in penurious
circumstances indeed. His father having the
preceding summer been too much indisposed
to manage his little farm with attention, and
being unable to hire labourers, his crops had
yielded but a scanty supply, and he had been
compelled to sell most of his stock to answer
pressing demands. With great joy they
welcomed
their son, whom they had given up as
lost.
You still find your father poor, Alonzo,
said the old gentleman, but you find him
still honest. From my inability to labour we
have latterly been a little more straitened than
usual, but having now recovered my health,
I trust that difficulty will soon be removed.
Haventon asked his father if he had ever
known Doctor Franklin.
We were schoolmates, he replied, and
were intimately acquainted after we became
young men in business for ourselves. We
have done each other favours: I once
divided
my money with Franklin on an urgent
occasion to him; he afterwards repaid me
with ample interest; he will never forget it.
Alonzo then related all the incidents of his
travels, minutely particularizing the
disinterested
conduct of Franklin, and presented to
his father the vouchers and documents
testifying
the restoration of his property. The
old man fell on his knees, and with streaming
tears offered devout thanks to the great
Dispenser
of all mercies.
Haventon next visited Melissa's father who
received him with much complacency: I
have injured you, said he, my young
friend, deeply injured you; but in doing this
have inflicted a wound still deeper in my
own breast; a wound which can never be
healed.
Permit not a renewal of your sorrows,
Sir, said Alonzo; the past is beyond recall.
A subject of some importance to me is the
design of my present visit: true it is that
your daughter was the object of my earliest
affection, an affection which my heart must
ever retain; but being separated by the will
of Providencefor I view Providence as
overruling all events for wise purposesI left
my country and wandered through distant
lands. Time, you know it is said, Sir, will
blunt the sharpest thorns of sorrow[
the old
man sighed
.] In my travels I have found a
lady so nearly resembling your daughter that
I was induced to sue for her hand, and have
been so happy as to obtain the promise of it.
The favour I have to ask of you, Sir, is only
that you will permit the marriage ceremony
to be celebrated in your house, as you know
my father is poor, his house small and
inconvenient
,
and that you will also honour me
by giving the lady away. In receiving
her from your hands I shall in some measure
realize former happy anticipations; I shall
receive her in the character of Melissa.
Ah! exclaimed Col. Bloomfield, were
it in my powercould I but give you the
original
!But
how vain that wish!Yes, my
young friend, your request is freely granted;
I will take upon myself the preparations;
name your day, and if the lady is portionless,
in that she shall be to me a Melissa.
Alonzo
expressed thankful gratitude, and after
appointing
that day week, departed.
Invitations were once more sent abroad for
the wedding of Alonzo and Melissa. Few
indeed knew it to be the real Melissa, but
they were generally apprized of Haventon's
avowed reasons for preferring the celebration
at the house of Col. Bloomfield.
The evening before the day on which the
marriage was to take place, Haventon and
Miss Bloomfield were sitting with the
Vincents
in an upper room, when a person rapped
at the door below: Vincent went down, and
immediately returned, introducing, to the joy
and surprise of the company, Edgar!
Here again we shall leave it for imagination
to depict the scene of an affectionate brother
meeting a tender and only sister whom he
supposed long since dead! He had been at
his father's and his mother let him into the
secret, when he immediately hastened to
Vincent's
.
He told them that he did not stay
long in Holland; that after receiving
Alonzo's
letter from Paris he felt an
unconquerable
propensity to return, and soon sailed for
America, arrived at Boston, came to
New-Haven
,
took orders in the ministry, and
reached home that day. Wilmot's letter he
never received. He informed them that the
VOL. II. X 2
Berghers were at his father's, and also some
relatives whom his mother had invited.
The next morning ushered in the day on
which the hero and heroine of our story were
to consummate their felicity. No
cross
purposes
approached to intervene their happiness;
no determined rival, no obdurate father, no
watchful, scowling aunt, to interrupt their
transports. It was the latter end of May;
Nature was arrayed in her richest ornaments,
and odoured with her sweetest perfumes. The
sun blended its mild lustre with the
landscape's
lovely green; light-winged breezes
frolicked amidst the flowers; the spring-birds
caroled in varying strains,
The air was fragrance and the world was love.
Evening was appointed for the ceremony,
and Edgar was to be the officiating clergyman,
To tie those bands which nought but death can sever.
When the hour arrived they repaired to the
house of Col. Bloomfield where numerous
guests had assembled. Melissa was ushered
into the bridal apartment and seated in
advance
of a brilliant circle of ladies. She was
attired in robes `white as southern clouds,'
spangled with silver, and fringed with deep
gold lace; her hair flowed in artless ringlets,
decorated by a wreath of flowers; a rich gem
blazed upon her bosom, and a diamond
clasped
the green girdle which encircled her waist.
She had regained all her former loveliness;
the rose and the lily again mingled their tinges
in her cheek; again pensive sprightliness
beamed in her eye, and the undulations of
beauty played in tremulous colourings over
her fine features. Alonzo was then
introduced
and took his station at the side of
Melissa
;
his father and mother came next, who
were placed at their right hand; Melissa's
parents followed and were stationed at their
left. Edgar then came and took his seat in
front, when the guests were summoned, who
filled the room.
After a short pause, the intended bride, the
brideg room and Edgar arose; the latter
turning
to Alonzo's parents, asked their sanction
to the proposed union; they bowed assent;
then addressing his own father with emotions
that scar cely suffered him to articulate, Do
you, Sir, said he, present this lady to that
gentleman?
A solemn silence prevailed in the room.
Melissa was extremely agitated as her father,
slowly rising, with downcast eyes and
mournful
aspect, took her trembling hand, and
conveyed
it into Alonzo's; May the smiles of
Heaven rest upon you, he sadly said; may
future blessings crown your present happy
prospectsand may your latter days never
be imbittered by the premature loss of near
and dear
Pungent grief here choked his utterance;
bitter sighs swelled his bosom, and large
drops coursed down his furrowed cheeks
At that moment Melissa sank upon her
knees; Dear father! she exclaimed,
bursting
into tears, pardon deception!
acknowledge
your daughteryour own Melissa!
Her father startedhe gazed at her with
scrutinizing attention, and fell back into his
chair.My daughter! he cried;
merciful
Heaven! my daughter!
The guests caught the contagious
sympathy
;
convulsive sobs arose from all parts of
the room. Melissa's father clasped her in his
arms; And do I receive thee, my child,
from the dead? he said; I am anxious to
hear the mystery unfolded. But first let the
solemn rites for which we are assembled be
concluded; let not an old man's anxiety
interrupt
the ceremony.
As you are acquainted with my
circumstances
,
said Alonzo, will you not esteem
it ungenerous to take advantage of your
present
feelings, Sir, seeing I am unable to
support
your daughter according to her deserts
and your own expectations?
Leave that to me, my young friend,
replied
her father; I have enough; my
children
are restored, and I am happy.
Melissa soon resumed her former station;
the indissoluble union was cemented; they sat
down to the wedding feast, while joy and
felicity
glowed in every countenance.
Before the company retired, Edgar related
the most prominent incidents of Alonzo and
Melissa's history, since they had been absent.
The guests listened with attention; they
applauded
the conduct of our new bride and
bridegroom, in which Melissa's father
cordially
joined; they rejoiced to find that
Alonzo's
parents had regained their fortune, and
copious libations were poured forth in honour
of the immortal Franklin.
And now, reader of sensibility, indulge the
pleasing sensations of thy bosom, for Alonzo
and Melissa are MARRIED.
CHAPTER XVII.
Here spring its earliest buds displays,
Here, latest on the leafless sprays,
The plumy nations sing;
The vernal shower, the summer clear,
The autumnal stores, the winter drear,
For thee new pleasures bring.
Humphreys
.
Alonzo
and
Melissa
are married
, said
we to the reader in closing our last chapter.
And here, were we to adopt the method of
some modern novelists, we might close our
history, and leave it for imagination to paint
the sequel.
They
seem to think it in style to
leave something to guess at, but
we
choose to
follow the old-fashioned course, and like the
lawyer in his declaration, tell the whole story.
Besides, there are some
mysteries
which, if
not elucidated, would render the narrative
incomplete
the
finishing stroke
would still be
wanting. Then, though the
denouement
has
been developed, the catastrophe displayed,
we shall, fashionable or not, proceed a little
beyond these events before we consign our
volumes to public scrutiny.
Alonzo's father soon realized the happy
effects
of Franklin's generous and discriminate
proceedings. He not only recovered the
principal
of the fortune he had lost, but the
damages
and the interest. Even his former
possessions
,
which had been both sold and bought
by fraud and collusion, were yielded up
without
difficulty; so that although like Job he
had seen affliction, like him his latter days
were better than his beginning. But wearied
with the active and tumultuous scenes of life,
he did not again enter into mercantile
business
,
but placing his money at interest in safe
hands, lived retired in the country.
A few days after the wedding, as Melissa
was sitting with Alonzo, Edgar and her
parents
,
she asked her father whether the old
mansion was inhabited.
Not by human beings, he replied;
since it has fallen into my hands I have
leased it to two or three different families,
who all soon left it under the foolish pretence
or impression of hearing strange noises and
seeing frightful objects; and such is the
superstition
of people that no one now will
venture
to try it again, though I suppose the
inhabitants
to consist only of rats and mice.
Melissa then informed them of all that had
happened while she was there; the alarming
noises and horrible appearances she had
been witness to, and in which she was
confident
her senses had not deceived her.
Exceedingly astonished at her relation, it
was determined that some persons should be
sent to the mansion in order to find whether
any discoveries could be made which might
lead to an elucidation of circumstances so
singular
and extraordinary.
They consequently selected five stout
fellows
and despatched them to the place with
orders to remain in the building through the
night; to return the following day and report
the result of their observations. Hickory canes
were the only weapons they carried, nor did
they expect to use even these. Two days
however
elapsed and they came not back.
Persons
were sent in search of them, but they
were nowhere to be found; nor could any
VOL. II. Y
traces of them be perceived either within the
house or inclosure, except that the
draw-bridge
was down, the gate and outer door of
the building unlocked, which evinced that the
men had been there.
Surprised at these alarming incidents, they
resolved upon taking measures more
effecually
to investigate so mysterious an affair. For
this purpose, Edgar and Alonzo chose out
thirty men among the tenants and labourers
of Col. Bloomfield, and in the neighbourhood,
armed them with muskets and swords, and
repaired to the mansion, where they arrived
in the dusk of the evening, having chosen that
season as most favourable to their designs.
They found the drawbridge, gate and door,
as the last messengers said they had left
them. When they came to the house they
cautiously proceeded to the chamber, where
they struck a fire and lit candles, which they
had brought with them. It was then agreed
to plant twenty of the men at suitable
distances
in the yard around the mansion,
and retain ten in the chamber with Alonzo
and Edgar. The men who were placed
without the building were stationed behind
trees, stumps or rocks, and where no objects
presented they lay flat on the ground, with
orders not to stir nor discover themselves
let what would ensue, unless an alarm should
be given from the house by the report of a
gun. Alonzo and Edgar were armed with
pistols and side arms, and having bolted the
outer door, posted themselves with the ten
men in the chamber, taking care that the
lights should not shine against the window
shutters, so that nothing could be discovered
from without. Things thus arranged they
preserved almost an entire silence, no one
being
allowed to speak except in a low whisper.
For a long time no sounds were heard
except
the hollow roar of winds in the
neighbouring
forest, their whistling around the
angles
of the mansion, or the hoarse murmurs of
the distant surge. They watched until
about midnight, when they were alarmed by
noises in the rooms below, among which they
could distinguish footsteps and human voices.
Alonzo and Edgar then taking each a pistol
in one hand and a drawn sword in the other,
ordered their men to follow them silently,
prepared for action. Coming to the head of
the stairs they saw a brilliant light streaming
into the hall; they therefore concluded to
take no candles, and to prevent discovery,
took off their shoes. When they came into
the hall opposite the door of the room from
whence the noise and light proceeded, they
perceived twelve men, genteely dressed,
sitting
around a table, on which were a number
of glasses and several decanters of liquor, as
also a quantity of gold and silver coin.
Alonzo
and his party stood a few minutes
listening
to the following discourse which was held
among this
ghostly
gentry.
Well boys! we have made a fine haul
this trip.
Yes; but poor Bob, though, was plump'd
over by the dd skulkers.
Ay, and had we not tugg'd bravely at the
oars, they would have hook'd us.
Those rascally cow-boys detained us too
long.
Well, well, never mind it; let us toss
round the wine and then divide the spoil.
Yes, yes; first wine and then money.
But where are our prisoners?
Safe; perfectly safe in limbo, boy.
And what is to be done with them?
Tomorrow night we are to take them
across
the
ferry;
then let them get back if
they can.
That will do; they thought to nab us,
but we were too old for them.
At this moment Alonzo and Edgar,
followed
by their men, rushed into the room, crying
Surrender, or you are all dead men! at the
same time discharging a pistol into the ceiling.
In an instant the room was involved in total
darkness; a loud crash was heard, then a
scampering about the floor, and a noise as if
several doors were shut with violence.
Immediately
the report of guns were heard around
the mansion. One of the men flew up stairs and
brought a light, but to their utter amazement
no person was to be discovered in the room
except their own party. The table with its
apparatus, and the chairs on which those now
invisible beings sat, had all disappeared as if
VOL. II. Y 2
by magic, not a single trace of them
remaining
.
While they stood petrified with
astonishment
,
the men from without called for
admittance. The door being opened, a
wounded stranger was led in, whom they
immediately
discovered to be one of those they
had seen at the table.
The men who were stationed in the yard
informed that some time before the alarm was
given, they saw a number of persons crossing
the inclosure, from the western part thereof,
towards the house; that immediately after
the report of the pistol, they discovered
several
people running from the building towards
the wall; they hailed them, which being
disregarded
,
they fired and one fell, who was the
wounded man they had brought in. The
others, though they pursued them, got off.
The prisoner's wound was not dangerous;
the ball had pierced his arm and glanced
upon his breast. They dressed his wound
as well as they could, and then requested him
to unfold the circumstances of the suspicious
appearance in which he was involved.
First promise me on your honour, said
the stranger, that you will use your
influence
to prevent my being punished or
imprisoned
.
To this they readily agreed, on
condition that he would conceal nothing from
them, and he gave them the following
relation
.
That they were part of a gang of
Illicit
Traders;
men who had combined for the
purpose of carrying on a secret and illegal
commerce with the British army on
Long-Island
,
which, contrary to the existing laws, they
supplied with provisions, brought off English
goods in exchange, and sold them at a very
extortionate price. But this was not all;
they also brought over large quantities of
counterfeit continental money; this they put
off among the Americans for live-stock,
poultry
and produce, which they carried to the
Island
.
The counterfeit money they purchased
by merely paying for the printing; the
British
having obtained copies of the American
emission, struck immense sums in New-York,
and insidiously sent it out into the country in
order to sink our currency. This gang
was likewise connected with the
Cow-Boys
,
who made it their business to steal, from the
farmers about the country, not only
milch-cows
and fat cattle, but also hogs and sheep,
which they drove by night to some convenient
place on the shores of the Sound, where these
thief-partners
received the plunder and
conveyed
it to the British.
In our excursions across the Sound,
continued the wounded man, we
frequently
observed this mansion, which from every
appearance we were convinced was
uninhabited
;
we therefore selected it as a suitable
place for our future rendezvous, which had
heretofore been only in the open woods.
To cross the moat we dragged up an old
canoe
from the sea shore, and concealed it in the
bushes soon as we recrossed from the
mansion
.
To get over the wall we used ladders
of ropes, placing a flat piece of thick board
on the points of the spikes. We found more
difficulty in entering the house; at length
however we succeded by tearing away a
small part of the building, and fitting in a door
so exactly and so naturally painted that it
could not be distinguished from the adjoining
parts. This door was so constructed that on
pressing a spring it would instantly fly
open, and when unrestrained would
voluntarily
shut with considerable force. Finding
the house so eligible for our purpose, and
fearing that at some future time we might be
disturbed either by the owner or some tenant,
we cut similar apertures through various parts
of the building into the yard, and also into all
the rooms, so that on emergency we could
traverse every apartment without access to the
usual passages. Trap doors on the same
construction
communicated with the cellar; the
table
which you saw us sitting around stood
upon
one of these, which on your abrupt
appearance
,
was, with its contents, after the candles
were extinguished, precipitated below, and we
made our escape by those secret passages,
judging that although you had seen us, if
we could get off, you would be unable to find
out any thing which might lead to a discovery,
as the trap-door, by force of the secret spring,
closed of itself soon as it became
disburdened
of its contents.
A circumstance shortly happened which
tended to embarrass our plans, and at first
seemed to menace their overthrow. Our
assembling
at the mansion was irregular, as
occasion
and circumstances occurred;
sometimes
not to exceed once a week; at others
more frequently, and always in the night,
though of late we have made it almost our
constant residence. Late one evening as we
were proceeding to the building, and had
arrived
near it, one of the chamber windows was
suddenly opened, and a light issued from
within. We entered the house with caution,
and soon discovered that some person was in
the room from whence we had seen the light.
We remained until all was silent and then
repaired
to the chamber by one of our secret
doors, and to our inexpressible surprise,
beheld
a beautiful young lady in bed and asleep
in the room. We cautiously retired, and
reconnoitering
all parts of the mansion, found
she was the only inhabitant, though there
were two beds in her chamber. The
singularity
of her being there alone is a
circumstance
we have never been able to discover,
but it gave us fair hopes of easily procuring
her ejectment. We then immediately
withdrew
and made preparations to dispossess the
fair tenant of premises to which we
considered
ourselves more properly entitled, as
possessing
a prior incumbency. We did not
effect
the completion of our apparatus under
three or four days; and once while it was
constructing, we returned to the house about
midnight in order to hold consultation
respecting
some of our plans and transactions.
As we approached the building it seems the
lady heard us, for again she flung up a
window
and held out a candle; we skulked from
the light, in hopes she would not discover us.
After entering the house we were silent and
still until we supposed her to be asleep,
which we found to be the case on going to
her apartment. We then commenced our
business
in the rooms below, and while there,
one of the company who was a little
intoxicated
,
overset a table we had been sitting
around
;
we feared this might awake her; but
not hearing any movement in her chamber,
we continued our sitting till towards day, and
then departed.
Soon as we were fully prepared we
returned
to the mansion at about eleven o'clock
in the evening. On entering the house, by
the inattention of one of our people, the door
flew to with force, the sound of which must
have alarmed the lady as we immediately
heard her descending the stairs, and retreated
to our hiding places. She did not stay long;
on he retiring to the chamber we returned to
put our scheme into execution.
When we found he was in a sound sleep
we stationed one near her bed, who by a
rap upon the floor with a cane, evidently
aroused
her in a fright. Noises were then made
below, the person in her room whispering at
the same time; she raised herself up, and he
fled behind the curtains. Soon after she
again
lay down and he approached nearer the
bed with a design to lay his hand, over
which he had drawn a thin sheet-lead glove,
upon her face: but discovering her arm on
the outside of the counterpane, he grasped
it; she screamed and sprang up; the man
then left the apartment. As it was not our
intention to injure the lady, but only to drive
her from the house, we concluded we had
sufficiently
alarmed her, and having
extinguished
the lights were about to depart, when we
heard her descending the stairs. She came
down and examined the doors; one of our
party, who had secreted himself in a closet
adjoining the hall, then whispering with
strong aspiration away! away! she darted
up stairs, and we left the house.
We did not return the next night in
order
to give her time to get off; but the
evening
after we again repaired to the mansion,
expecting that she had gone, but were
disappointed
.
As it was late when we arrived she
was asleep, and we found that more forcible
measures must be resorted to before we could
remove her, and for such measures we were
amply prepared.
The stranger then unfolded the mysteries
of that awful night when Melissa was so
terrified
by horrible appearances. One of the
tallest of the gang was attired as has been
described
when he appeared by her bed-side.
The white robe was a sheet stained in some
parts with a liquid red mixture; the wound
in his breast was artificial, and the apparent
blood issuing therefrom was this red liquid
pressed from a small bladder concealed under
his robe. On his head and face he wore a
mask with glass eyes; the mask was painted
to suit their purposes. The bloody dagger
was of wood, and painted also.
Thus accoutred he took his stand near
Melissa's bed; he first extinguished the
candles
she had left burning and then discharged
a small pistol. Perceiving this had
awakened
her, a train of powder was fired in the
adjoining
room, opposite the secret door, which
VOL. II. Z
was left open so that the flash might
illuminate
her apartment; then several large
cannon-balls, they had picked up on Long
Island
,
and which they used as ballast, were
rolled through the rooms over her head,
imitative
of thunder. The person in her
chamber
next uttered a horrible groan, and gliding
along by her bed, took his stand behind the
curtains near the foot. The noises below, the
cry of murder, the firing of the second pistol,
and the running up stairs, were all
corresponding
scenes to impress terror on her
imagination
.
The pretended ghost then
advanced
in front of her bed, while lights were
slowly introduced, which first shone faintly,
until they were ushered into the room by the
secret passage, exhibiting the man before
her in all his horrific attitudes. On her
shrieking and shrinking into bed, the lights
were suddenly extinguished, and the person
after commanding her to
begone
in a hoarse
voice, passed again to the foot of the bed,
shook it violently, and made a seeming
attempt
to get on it, when perceiving her to be
springing up he fled out of the room by the
private aperture, cautiously closed it and
joined his companions.
The operators had not yet completed their
farce, or rather to Melissa, tragedy. They
had framed an image of paste-board in
human
shape, arrayed it in black, its eyes being
formed of
ignis vulpina
, vulgarly called
fox
fire
,
[8]
[8]
A sort of decayed, or rotten, phosphoric wood, which
in the night appears like coals of fire, of a bright
whitish
colour. It emits a faint light.
some of the same material being placed
in its mouth wrapped in thin scarlet tiffany
in order to give it the appearance of flame.
They had also constructed a large
combustible
ball of paste-board, several inches thick,
to which a match was affixed. The image
they intended to convey into her room, place it
before her bed, and while in that position to
cover the ball with phosphorus, set the match
on fire, and roll it across her chamber, and
when it should burst, the image was to
vanish
by being suddenly conveyed out by the
secret passage, which was to close the scene
for that night. But Melissa having now
arisen
and lighted candles, the plan was defeated.
While they were consulting how to proceed
they heard her unlock her chamber door and
slowly descend the stairs. Fearing a
discovery
they retired with their lights, and the
person who had been in her chamber, not
having
yet stripped off his ghostly habiliments,
lay down on one side of the hall. The man
who had the image, crowded himself with it
under the stairs she was descending. On her
dropping the candle when she turned to flee
to her room from the sight of the same
object which appeared at her bed side,
the fellow under the stairs presented the
image at their foot; at the same instant the
combustible ball was prepared and rolled
through the hall; and when on its bursting
she fainted, they began to grow alarmed;
but finding she quickly revived and regained
her apartment, they departed for that time
from the house.
Our scheme, continued the prisoner,
had the desired effect: on returning a few
evenings after, we found the lady gone and
the furniture removed. Several attempts
were afterwards made to occupy the mansion,
but we always succeeded in soon frightening
the inhabitants away.
A few evenings since, on coming to the
house, we heard a noise in one of the rooms
adjoining the hall. On a cautious examination
we perceived, by the light of a candle they
had with them, five men in the apartment.
Listening to their discourse, we found they
were sent to make discoveries. We waited
some time in hopes they would depart, but
finding they intended to stay till morning, we
soon determined how to act. As they were
unarmed, and there being more than twenty
of us then together, we suddenly rushed in
upon them, and after a short scuffle made
them all prisoners. They are now confined
in a secret part of the building. Considering
it not safe to liberate them, tomorrow
evening
they were to be conveyed to the Island
and delivered to the British.
Edgar and Alonzo then directed their
prisoner
to lead them instantly to the place
where their five messengers were confined,
and then to show them the machinery of those
secret doors, and how they were managed.
This he did immediately. The springs were
sunk in the wood, which being pressed by
entering
a gimblet hole with a pointed steel
instrument
that each of the gang always had about
him, the door would fly open, shut, and fasten
again of itself. On raising the trap door
whereon
VOL. II. Z 2
the twelve fellows sat when first discovered,
they perceived in the cellar beneath, the table
and chairs, with the decanters and glasses
broken, as also the money which they
secured
.
In one part of the cellar was
a kind of cave, its mouth covered with
boards and earth; here the company kept
their furniture, and thither would they have
removed it, had they not been so suddenly
frightened away. Within this cavern was
another trap-door fastened by one of those
springs, which the prisoner opened, and there,
in a deep dungeon, they found the five men,
whom to their mutual joy they quickly
released
.
The canoe they were shown secreted in
the bushes beyond the canal.
It was agreed that the prisoner should go
before the proper authorities in a
neighbouring
town, and there, as state's evidence, make
affidavit of what he had recited, and a
complete
development of the characters
concerned
in the business, when he was to be
released
.
The man inquired to what town they
were to proceed, which when they had
informed
him, This, said he, will enable
me to perform one act of justice before I
leave the country, as leave it I must,
immediately
after I have given in my testimony, or
I shall be assassinated by some of those who
will be implicated in the transactions I have
related. He then told them that while he
with his companions was prosecuting the
illicit
trade, a British ship came and anchored in
the Sound, which they supplied with
provisions
;
but that having at one time a
considerable
quantity on hand, the ship sent its boat
with an officer and five men to fetch them; the
officer with two of the hands came on shore,
leaving the rest of the men in the boat. As
we were about to convey the provisions on
board the boat, continued the man, a
party
of Americans rushed from the woods, fired
upon us and wounded the officer in the thigh,
who fell; `I shall be made prisoner and
probably plundered,' said he, taking out his
purse and handing it to me; `keep this,
and if I live perhaps you may restore it to me
when in prison, where I shall need it.
Fly; alarm the boat's crew, and shift for
yourselves.' The two sailors fled to the boat,
which returned to the ship, and we also saved
ourselves by flight. This happened about
four months ago; the ship soon after sailed for
New-York; the officer was imprisoned in the
jail of the town to which we are going; I have
twice been there for the purpose of restoring
him the purse, but being a stranger I could
not gain admission to the prison; with your
assistance the measure may now be effected.
The man further informed them that they
were several times near being taken by the
Americans, and that in their last trip they
were fired upon and one of their party killed.
Soon as morning appeared they set out for
the aforesaid town, after having dismissed
their men, and when they arrived there
Alonzo and Edgar accompanied their
prisoner
to the jail. On making their business
known they were conducted into a dark and
dirty apartment where were several captives
in irons. The British officer was soon
distinguished
among them by his regimentals.
Though enveloped in filth and dust, his
countenance
appeared familiar to Alonzo, and on
a few moments recollection he recognized, in
the manacled seamen, the generous
midshipman
,
Jack Brown, who had so
disinterestedly
relieved him when he escaped from the
prison in London! In the fervency of his
feelings Alonzo flew to him and folded him
in his arms. What do I behold! he cried;
my friendmy brave deliverer, in chains
in my own country!
The fortune of war, boy, said Jack;
it might have been worse. But my lad, I
am heartily glad to see you; how has it
fared with you since you left old England.
We will talk of that at a future time,
said Alonzo.
There were then some American officers of
distinction in the town with whom Edgar was
acquainted, and to whom he applied for the
release of the noble sailor. As there were
several other British prisoners in the jail, it
was agreed that a cartel should be
immediately
sent to New-York to exchange them.
Alonzo
had therefore the satisfaction to see the
irons knocked off his liberal-hearted
benefactor
,
and his prison doors opened. The man
they had taken at the mansion returned him
his purse, containing only twenty-five guineas,
of which Brown gave him ten; There boy,
said he, you have been honest, so I will
divide
with you. They then repaired to an
inn; Jack, whose wound was healed, was
put under the hands of a barber, cleaned,
furnished
with a change of clothes, and soon
appeared
in a new attitude.
He informed them that soon after
Haventon
left England the Severn was ordered for
America; that the price of provisions
growing
high, it had taken almost all his wages to
support his family, though he was under
lieutenant's pay, having been advanced to
that station; that he had sent home his last
remittance just before he was taken,
reserving
only the twenty-five guineas which had
been restored him that day. But I have
never despaired, said he; the great
Commodore
of life orders all for the best. My
tour of duty is to serve my king and country,
and provide for my dear Poll and her chicks,
which if I faithfully perform I shall gain
applause
from the Commander.
When the cartel was ready to depart,
Haventon
drawing Brown aside from the
company
,
presented him with a draught of five
hundred pounds sterling on a merchant in
New-York, who privately transacted business
with the Americans. Take this my friend,
said he; you can ensure it by converting it
into bills of exchange on London. Though
you once saw me naked and poor, I can now
conveniently spare this sum, and it may
assist
you in buffeting the billows of life. The
affectionate tar, with tears of gratitude,
clasped
Alonzo to his bosom; in eloquent silence
they separated, each fervently invoking
Heaven
for blessings on his mutual benefactor.
The man who came with Haventon and
Bloomfield from the mansion, went before the
magistrates of the town and gave in his
testimony
and affidavit, by which it appeared that
several eminent characters in Connecticut
were concerned in the illicit trade. They
then released him, after giving him the money
they had found in the cellar, and he
immediately
left the town. Warrants were soon
after
issued for apprehending those illicit
traders
;
several were taken who belonged to the
gang, and some remotely connected therewith;
but most of them absconded, so that the
company
were dispersed and their illegal trading
schemes annihilated.
When Alonzo and Edgar returned home
and related their adventure, they were all
astonished
at the fortitude of Melissa by which
she was enabled to support her spirits in a
solitary
mansion, amidst such great and so many
terrors.
Haventon now turned his attention to
future
prospects. It was time to select a place
for domestic residence. He consulted
Melissa
,
and she expressively mentioned the
little
rural village, where
Ere fate and fortune frown'd severe,
they had projected scenes of conjugal bliss, and
planned the structure of their family edifice.
Do you not remember, Alonzo, said she,
that I once remarked, `This shall be my
Asylum?
'
Never can I forget it, he replied; and
now the prediction shall be verified.
The scite formerly marked out, with an
adjoining
farm, was immediately purchased, and
suitable buildings erected, to which they
removed
the ensuing summer. To this place
they gave the name of
Asylum
, which it
locally
retains to the present day.
Here did Melissa and Alonzo repose after
the storms of adversity were past. Here did
they realize all the happiness which the
sublunary
hand of time apportions to mortals. The
varying seasons diversified their joys, except
when Haventon was called with the militia of
his country, in which he was honoured with a
distinguished commission, to oppose the
enemy
,
and this was not unfrequent, as in his
country's defence he took a very conspicuous
part; then would anxiety, incertitude and
disconsolation possess the bosom of Melissa,
until dissipated by his safe return. But the
happy termination of the war soon removed
all cause of these inquietudes.
Shortly after the return of peace Alonzo
received
a letter from his friend, Jack Brown,
dated at an interior parish in England, in
which, after pouring forth abundance of
gratitude
,
he stated that at the close of the war he
returned to England and was discharged from
the navy; that he then sold his house in town
and removed into the country, where he had
set up an inn with the sign of
The Grateful
American
. You have made us all happy,
said he; my dear Poll blubbered like a
fresh-water sailor in a hurricane when I told
VOL. II. A a
her of your goodness. My wife, my
children
all
hands upon deck are yours. We
have a good run of business, and are now
under
full sail for the land of prosperity.
The clergyman of the village where
Haventon
resided having died, Edgar was called
to the pastoral charge of this unsophisticated
people. He shortly after married Katharine
Bergher. The Baron Du Ruyter returned
to Germany, accompanied by Roderick, who
had been his aid-de-camp through the war,
and whom the Baron intended to make the
principal heir to his large estates.
Alonzo and Melissa were frequently
visited
by their parents, as also by Vincent,
his lady, and the Berghers, with many other
friends and acquaintance, who all rejoiced
in their felicity, after such a diversity of
troubles
.
Alfred was generally once a year their
guest, until at length he married and settled
in mercantile business at Charleston.
To our hero and heroine the native charms
of their retired village were a source of ever
pleasing variety. Spring, with its verdured
fields, flowery meads, and vocal groves, its
balmy gales, purling rills, and its evening
whipperwill; summer, with its embowering
shades reflected in the glassy lake, its mild
showers, gay rainbow, its lightning, its
thunder, and the long, pensive, yet
sprightly
notes of the solitary Strawberry-bird;
autumn
,
with its mellow fruit, yellow foliage,
falling leaf, and decaying verdure;
winter
,
with its hoarse, rough blasts, icy bands,
stormy skies, and snowy mantleall
tended
to thrill, with sensations of pleasing
transition
,
the feeling bosoms of
Alonzo
and
Melissa
,
in their early chosen, long sought, but
finally happy, secluded
Asylum
.
THE END.
