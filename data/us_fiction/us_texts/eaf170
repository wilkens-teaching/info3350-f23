HERMAN DE RUYTER:
BY PROFESSOR J. H. INGRAHAM.
Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1844, In the Clerk's Office of the District of
Massachusetts, by H. L. Williams.
CHAPTER I.
The Book-man's Stall.
It
was a few minutes past nine o'clock
three evenings
previous
to the sudden
disappearance
of the beautiful `Cigar-Vender,'
whose adventurous life, up to that time, has
afforded us the subject of a former Tale, when
the keeper of a miserable book-stall situated
in a narrow thoroughfare leading from Pearl
into Chatham street, prepared to close his
stall for the night. His stall consisted of
some rude shelfs placed against the wall of a
low and wretched habitation, with a sunken
door on one side of the shelves by which he
had ingress from the side-walk into a dark
narrow apartment that served him as a
dwelling-place
.
There were shelves against the
street wall on both sides of his door, a board
placed in front of which, encroaching about
two feet upon the pavement formed a sort of
counter. It was supported at each end by
rough empty boxes, in the cavity of one of
which, upon a bundle of straw as it stood on end,
facing inward, lay a small, ugly shock-dog with
a black turn-up nose, and most fiery little gray
eyes. In the opposite box,
vis-a-vis
to the
little spiteful dog crouched a monstrous white
Tom cat, with great green eyes, and a visage
quite as savage as that of a panther. Thus
with the counter and the boxes supporting it,
the keeper was enclosed in a sort of
ingeniously
constructed shop, which he had
contrived
to cover by a strip of canvass, which
served as a shade from the sun as well as a
shelter from the storms. The contents of his
shelves presented to the passer-by a singular
assemblage of old books, pamphlets, songs,
pictures of pirates and buccaneers hung in
yellow-painted frames; two-penny portraits
of murderers and other distinguished
characters
in this line, with ferocious full lengths of
General Jackson, and Col. Johnson killing
Tecumseh! Rolls of ballads, piles of sailor's
songs of the last war, last dying speeches and
lives of celebrated criminals, were strewn
upon the counter, to which was added a
goodly
assortment of children's picture books and
toys. Cigars and even candy were displayed
to tempt the various tastes of the passers-by,
and even gay ribbons, something faded,
exposed
in a pasteboard box were offered as a
net to catch the fancy of the females who
might glance that way.
The whole stall with its treasures, was
lighted by a tin lamp suspended by a piece of
twine from a nail above the door which gave
admittance to the little dark room behind the
stall. The light fell full upon the person and
features of the keeper, as he lifted his face
while removing from their places some of the
prints which had garnished the rough wall of
his tenement, preparatory to restoring them
to a box in his room from which he had taken
them when he opened and arranged his stall
in the morning.
This man was low in stature and squarely
framed, with a high protuberance between his
shoulders, nearly level with the top of his
head. He was also lame, his left leg being
shrunk and drawn up so that for the most
part when he stood, he stood on but one leg,
with difficulty touching the ground with the
toe of the other when he walked. The man's
head was finely shaped, and its expression
intelligent
.
His hair was a soft brown, and
curled with a grace and beauty about his neck
that singularly contrasted the unsightly aspect
of his figure. He seemed to be proud of this,
for it was trimmed and oiled with the
greatest
care, and arranged about his high, white
forehead with the most fastidious taste. The
features of the man were finely cut, were
even noble in their cast; but a bitter sneer,
a sinister, dark expression of in-dwelling
malignity
deformed them, and made them
repulsive
,
and himself feared.
Yet this man had been born with a heart
as gentle as an angel's and he grew up with
feelings overrunning with benevolence, and
the love of his species. A fairer, purer,
holier
spirit of universal love never inhabited the
human bosom. His eye beamed sweetness
and tenderness upon all, and his heart, filled
to the brim with love, sent forth a hundred
streams to irrigate and enrich everywhere
the soil of human affection. He loved all,
and yearned for that sympathy with his love,
which is love's nourishment! But as he grew
from boyhood to manhood, as the dear,
domestic
circle which had surrounded him,
with a chain of tenderest affection, link by
link dropped away into the grave, and he was
at length left exposed without the covered
shield of a mother's or a sister's love, to the
cold gaze and unfeeling mockery of the outer
world, how like the sensitive plant, his heart
shrunk up and folded itself within itself! how
his spirit withered as the flower withers
before
the sudden frost.
Then he learned his deformity! Then he
learned that men despised him! Then he felt
that he was not loved! How bitter was the
anguish
of that conviction! From that hour a
change came over the amiable and loving
spirit! His love gradually grew to hatred as
he grew to manhood, and he felt that he was
at feud with his kind. Yet, at times, as he
struggled on for subsistence, for he had been
left poor, he strove to find some one to
love
some one to love
him!
His heart was
yearning
daily in secret for a soul kindred with his
own! His only solace was books. He read,
read, read that in the world of other's minds
he might become oblivious of the dark
thoughts of his own.
When he was thrown upon his own
exertions
,
and found every avenue to honorable
exertion closed to him on account of his de
formity, when he found that men turned from
him with contempt, he ceased to mingle with
men: he resolved to be independent of their
favor. With a little money, but a dollar or
two, which he possessed, he purchased a few
books and placed himself near the Park to sell
them. He had no other stall than a basket.
He read constantly. He asked no one to buy
of him; he solicited no man's favorable
attention
to his little stock. Yet he sold a few
books daily, and by degrees increased his
store. He then opened a little stall in the
quarter of the town in which Herman de
Ruyter
had lived, where he is first introduced to
the reader. Time passed on, and we now
find him where he is again brought to our
notice in an obscure lane, in the act of
closing
his little stall. He had still yearned for
the love of some one of his kind in vain. But
he had found none, and then he sought the
love of the brute creation; but even the noble
dog he would have won to his side to love him
with that attachment peculiar to his race,
shunned his advances. At length one day the
ugly little shock-dog which now lay in the
box by his side, being persecuted for its very
ugliness by boys, fled for shelter under his
stall. He extended to the miserable creature
his protection, and from that hour the grateful
animal remained with him and showed
towards
him the profoundest gratitude and most
touching affection. Not long afterwards he
saw a man passing his stall with a hideous
and fierce looking cat with a stone tied to its
neck. The pitiable condition of the animal
moved him to save her; for he felt that, like
himself, she was an outcast. He prevailed
on the man to surrender her to him,
although
warned that the fierce creature was
too savage to be suffered to go loose. But
from the day the Deformed Book-man took
her she manifested towards him only the
kindest attachment. Thus the three had
lived together many months, being the whole
family of the stall-man. By day they sat on
either side of him, as he read in his books, or
waited in silence on his customers, at night
they shared his little room, one sleeping at
his feet the other at his head. Such was the
character, person, profession, companions, and
domestic arrangement of Rolfe Brant, or `the
Book-man,' as he was most generally called.
He was in the act of removing his last
parcel of musty books from his counter into
his rear room, in which at night this outcast
of his kind safely locked up his goods, himself
and his two favorites, when a young man in
the dress of a seaman who was passing by,
stopped and gazed full and intensely upon the
form of Brant, whose back was towards him.
The light of the stall lamp shone full upon the
stranger, who was well dressed in a blue
sailor's
round-about open before, with full white
trowsers, a black handkerchief loosely knotted
in front and was without a vest, better to
display
his fine blue shirt, which lay in careless
folds across his manly chest. He was tall
and symmetrical, with a bold free bearing,
which was sustained by a fine dark
countenance
,
shaded by locks of raven black hair
that swept his shoulders. A mustache
darkened
his upper lip, and gave strength and
energy to the expression of a face as
determined
as it was handsome.
He stood gazing upon the Book-man with a
look partly of recognition, partly of surprise.
At length Brant turned half-round to call to
his dog and cat to follow him into the house.
As he did so, and the features of his
countenance
were strongly revealed in profile under
the lamp, the young man uttered an
exclamation
of recognition and pleasure. With a
light curled rattan which he carried he
reached
over the counter and struck the
stall-keeper
lightly upon the shoulder to draw his
attention
.
At the act the shaggy shock-dog
bristling up his back and showing his teeth
sprung from the box, uttered a fierce yelp of
rage and vindictiveness and flying at him
fastened his sharp fangs in his leg, while the
huge Tom cat leaped like a hyena upon hi
breast and clung there mouthing and spitting
like an enraged ape, and savagely tearing at
his bosom with her sharp claws. The
Book-man
had, also, at the same moment turned to
see who gave the blow.
`Rolfe! man! Brant! What the devil!
Call off your cats and imps!' cried the young
seaman as he struggled to free himself from
these assailants. `Do you mean an old friend
shall be torn to pieces in this way?' And as
he spoke he seized the huge cat in both hands
by the throat and with difficulty disengaged
him, bringing away with his claws bleeding
portions of his blue checked shirt. He was
about to dash him to the pavement and then
liberate himself from the dog which still
vindictively
tugged at his leg, when Rolfe cried,
pressing forward and grasping the cat also,
`Herman, hurt him not' He is all I love,
or that loves me save Pest! Away, Pest! Let
go and into your house, sir!' he cried to the
shock-dog; which, giving another sharp bite
to the tendon he had fastened upon with his
teeth, sulkily retired as far as the door and
there sat on his haunches and with his long
hair bristling like a porcupine's quill's,
contented
himself with growling in a most
snappish
and ill-natured way. In the meanwhile
the young man had released his hold on the
Tom-cat and Brant had dropped him upon
the ground saying kindly,
`Go in, Snowy! You are too quick, you
and Pest both of you!'
`Quick as the flash of a gun, Rolfe! What
the devil do you keep such impish beasts
about you for?' he demanded staunching the
trickling blood that flowed freely from the
scratch in his breast, and stooping down to
examine his ancle. `Confound that little
black brute! His teeth are like needles! The
fellow has met his jaws through the skin.'
`I am sorry you have met with such a
reception
,
Herman,' said Rolfe, in a tone of
more gentleness than was his wont. `Come
in, and I will try and see what I can do for
you?'
`Never mind. They are mere scratches!
Musketoe bites! They are sharp but they
are little fellows those friends of yours, Rolfe,
and are not worth noticing! The scratches
will be well enough in a day or too. I am
too impatient to think about any thing till I
hear where and how my mother is. I have
just now, within the last hour got in from two
years absence at sea, and was hastening up to
the Post Office to see if there was any letter
from her there for me. When I sailed she
was living in Boston, and I have had letters
regularly from her or Maria, until six months
past, since when I have not had a word.'
`You need not go to the Post Office
to-night
,
Herman, as the hour for keeping it open
has passed. Besides your mother is in New
York!'
`In New York?' exclaimed Herman with
surprise.
`Yes. She has been living here three
months at least!'
`How do you know this?'
`I have seen her pass here often in that
time, and always with such things in her
hands as leads me to know she keeps house
and is not visiting!'
`Andandmy friend who gives such good
news, tell me is she well? Looked she well?'
asked Herman earnestly.
`I have now closed my stall, and your
wounds are troublesome to you. Come into
my little room and with some cotton I have
there I will staunch the blood and then we
will talk more at ease!'
Herman looked suspiciously at Pest and
Snow who sat on their haunches on either
side of the door, when Brant, catching the
direction
of his glances, made a motion of his
hand. Both obeyed by retiring from the
door and seating themselves at the foot of a
low truckle bed, one at one post, the other at
the other post, from which respective positions
they kept up a most vigilant watch upon
the intruder, from time to time exchanging
glances with each other of the most
unmitigated
suspicion of the intentions of the
stranger
;
for many a month had past since human
foot step had crossed the threshold of their
solitary master.
Herman stooped to enter the door of the
low apartinent and the book-man having taken
down his lamp from the nail outside, closed
the door and turned a ponderous key in an
enormous lock. There was no chair in the
room, and Herman seated himself upon a heap
of books, while his host occupied the side of
the bed. The lamp stood upon a low mantle,
beneath which, in a broken fire-place, were
a few utensils for cooking.
`It is a long time since we met, Herman,'
said Brant after surveying the young man
closely.
`Yet you knew me at the first glance!'
`I never forget the faces of men,' said Brant,
with emphasis. `You recognised me at once!'
he added with severe irony.
`Yes, Brant! I '
`Enough. You need not tell me what I
know, that God has given me Cain's mark!
So you are returned from sea! You have
grown. You are tall and noble looking,
Herman
!
Such as you are now you promised to
be when you were a boy!'
`You have not changed, Rolfe,' said
Herman
looking at him closely. `Do you
remember
that it was you who first told me
about my father's being in prison? From
that day, Brant, the seeds of the devil's
wickedness
were sown in my heart. A
recklessness
seized upon me, and I felt a wild joy in
making shipwreck of all the good and
virtuous
principles my mother, my good and noble
mother had so carefully instilled into my heart
hoping that if I could be kept ignorant of
my father's crimes I might grow up an honest
man!'
`I remember that time! I pitied you then,
Herman, when I saw the anguish with which
you heard the tale of your father's criminal
deeds. I told it you not in malice, boy, for I
was not then so profoundly the hater of my
species as I am now. Yet I hate not all men.
I find that kindly feelings are still in my heart
when I see you. You did me a kindness then,
and I have never forgotten it. You did me the
only kind act man has done me since my
sister
and mother died and left me a blot on God's
earth for every heartless being, perchance,
who stands erect to spit his venom on!' The
dark, deep sunken eyes of Brant glowed as
he spoke and thought of his wrongs from his
kind.
`You take it too much at heart, Brant.
People
don't hate you, so much as you think. It
is most in your fancy! But what of my
mother
?
When did you see her last?'
`On Monday morning.'
`How did she look? Well?'
`Thin and poor!'
`Poor? It is impossible. She had means!'
`Yet she looked poor and sad!'
`I hope not! Did you speak to her?'
`I speak to nobody first, Herman?'
`Was she alone always. Did you not see
any one with her?' he asked eagerly. `Tell
me quickly, Brant?
`But once have I seen her pass with any
one,' aaswered the Deformed, his countenance
changing, and an extraordinary expression
passing over it.
`And whowho was this? was it Maria?'
Who do you mean, Herman? Once before
you spoke of Maria, as having written you?
Of whom do you speak?' This question was
put in a tone of calmness, so calm that it was
plainly assumed to conceal any opposite
emotion
that his voice might betray.
`Of  but you do
not
know, either! We
left the city directly, and he
could
not know,'
said Herman to himself, the dark, intellectual
observing eyes of Brant resting upon his face
the while with the closest scrutiny. `Why it
my sister!' he answered after a moment's
hesitation and deeply coloring; for he saw at
once that any other confession would be
imprudent
.
`I never knew you had a sister. I knew
your father, that is as I knew other men, and
I knew no tthat he had two children. It may
be so!'
`May be so? Do you doubt my word,
Brant?' cried Herman, his handsome
countenance
darkening, and the indications of his
fiery nature, manifesting themselves in every
lineament.
`No, Herman,' answered Brant, a smile
scarcely perceptible, creeping about the
corners
of his sarcastic mouth. `No Herman, I
doubt not but that you had a sister!
Doubtless
,
she has another mother than thine, eh?'
`Was the person you saw with my mother
young and beautiful and aboutlet me see
about seventeen she must be by this time!'
asked Herman letting the suspicion pass.
`Such was her description. Both young
and beautiful,' answered the Dwarf, with a
look of extraordinary melancholy and feeling.
`I saw such a maiden passing once with your
mother!'
`Had she blue eyes and fair hair, with a
sweet look and gentle smile?'
`You have described her, Herman,' replied
Brant sighing, then recovering himself, and
frowning, and biting his lips.
`I saw her once,
only
once! Till now,' he
continued with animation, I knew not who
she was!
Thy
sister! It is good, Herman. I
thank thee for thy news.' As he spoke the
last words, his face assumed an expression of
singular decision of inward purpose, and he
seemed to have spoken absently to himself,
rather than addressed them to Herman. The
young man did not regard the expression of
his countenance, being at the moment busily
watching the furtive manuvres of Pest, who
had left his bed-post and seemed to be stealing
around the room for the purpose of making,
as he supposed, further demonstrations of
hostility. The eye of his master, however,
arrested him, and he turned and went
snapping
his teeth back to his place.
`What an imp of Satan you have there,
Brant! Well, I am glad to hear from my
mother. I can't imagine what can have
brought her back to New York, But for
meeting you I should have posted off to
Boston
to-morrow. Thanks, good Ralfe; now if
you can tell me how to find her out, I shall
be your debtor doubly!'
`That I can't do, Herman; though she
lives in this neighborhood I am confident. I
have wished to ascertain since the '
here the Dwarf suddenly checked himself,
and added, `since I saw she looked so poor;
for I would gladly have assisted her for your
sake, Herman. So she is his sister?' he
added
to himself, with a glowing cheek, and an
eye and lip eloquent with some strange and
deep emotion of the soul within, `So she is
his sister! It may be, and may be not? 'Tis
strange!'
`Well, Rolfe, good night! You can't assist
me farther, and I must go where I can get
information
.
Yet I dont know where to take
the first step forward?'
`Herman,' said Ralfe suddenly, `do you
recollect your father?'
`I? No!'
`Would you like to know that he was free?
Would you like to see him?'
The young man stood and looked at his
interrogater
with intense surprise for several
seconds.
`Is my father still living?' he demanded
hoarsely.
`Yes. I ask you would you like to see
him?'
Herman was silent a moment, and then
replied
;
`Brant I ought not to wish to see my
father but to curse him; for, but for his crime
I should not have been the man I am? I do
not know,I cannot say whether I would like
to see him or not! Is he at liberty!'
`I saw him pass here this very day!'
`My father?'
`Yes.'
`How looked he?'
`As he did fourteen years ago, though gray
hairs were mixed with his black locks. He
was something bent, yet his frame was strong
and his step bold!'
`How was he clad?'
`Illy.'
`He is my father too! I
should
like to see
him, not to be known to him,' answered
Herman
thoughtfully. `How has he become
free?'
`His sentence was for life; but after
serving
fourteen years the Governor has
pardoned
him. I knew he was out for I saw it in
the papers last week!'
`I would give much to see him!' answered
Herman with thoughtful earnestness. `I
would give much to behold my father!' he
added with a deeper tone that seemed to come
from the depths of his chest.
`You will find him, doubtless at the
Saracen's
Head, for I saw him in company with a
rare villain who haunts there!'
`I will see him, then,' answered Herman
decidedly. `Think you my mother has met
him?' he inquired with a flashing eye.
`No, Yet 'tis possible through him, you
may learn where she is, as he would be likely
to seek her out!'
`Then I go at once to the Saracen's head,'
he answered going to the door, which the
stall-keeper opened for him.
`When you have made the discovery let
me know, Herman? now, good night. I have
entertained you as my guest which I would
never do for any other man!'
`No man would come to visit you often, to
have such a reception as your imps gave me.
You must have a strange fancy for ugliness,
Rolfe, to keep such savage brutes about you.
But no matter, the scars are done bleeding,
and I don't mind it, if they are not poisoned!
Well, good night. I will drop in to see you
to-morrow'
Thus speaking Herman de Ruyter went up
out of the low den which served the
Book-man
for a habitation, and rapidly took his way
up the street in the direction of the Saracen's
Head.
CHAPTER II.
The Saracen's Head.
The
`Saracen's Head,' towards which
Herman
directed his step after quitting the
wretched
stall of the Book-man, was situated at the
head of the narrow street he was traversing,
and in the neighborhood of the City Prison,
the dark Egyptian, walls of which towered
high and frowningly above it. It was at the
corner with a door on either side, and above
the angle projecting over the narrow
side-walk
was a rude sign-board on which was
pictured
a rude representation of a Turk's Head
in a green turban and an enormous blue beard,
The building was two low stories in height,
with a hip-roof and dormer windows; the
roof steep and much broken in places, and
the windows set with very small bull's eye
panes The house was sunken several feet
below the pavement, partly from age and
partly by the gradual elevation and levelling
of the streets that it faced upon. It had once
been red but was now a dingy brown and had
the appearance, altogether, of a tavern of the
lowest order. It had originally been square,
but various additions to its length on either
wing had given it a rambling over-laden look;
and as these additions were in every possible
variety as suited the purse or taste of the
owner of the tenement, they added much to
its picturesque aspect, as well as increased his
income; for the apartments, some under
ground, some above ground, and some stuck
upon the roof like one cage placed a-top of
another, being let out to various tenants, added
not a little to the income of the economical
landlord.
The renter of this rambling row of
tenements
was the hostes of `Saracen's Head,'
who not only kept on the corner a famous
tap-room
,
which she styled a `Coffee House,' in
red letters on a pinkground, placed over the
principal door, but let `furnished lodgings' at
eleven York shilling's a week, or `a single
bed' for ninepence. Dame Dilley, or as she
was better known, `Dirk Dilley,' from her
habit of carrying a dirk sheathed in her
girdle
,
did not only let rooms to lodgers, but she
rented by the week and month, apartments in
the more remote quarters of her habitation
attached
to the Saracen's Head. Thus she had
under her miscellaneous union of roofs no
less than nine families who rented rooms of
her independent of the `Coffee House,' poor
people who furnished their own quarters, such
furnishing as it was, and lived as they could,
whether by theft or honest industry, Dirk
Dilley never made it her business to inquire
so that she got her weekly dues for rent.
Some of these families got to their apartments
by a door on the street in a line with the `
Coffee
House; others reached them by going in
a narrow passage a few steps and clambering
up a damp, miserable flight of steps, here and
there one of the decayed boards missing;
while others passed from the side walk through
a cellar door, and traversing a sort of
underground
passage, dark at noon-day, emerged in
the rear of the tavern into the yard of the
house. This yard or court was narrow, and
closely built round by wooden sheds two
stories
high, the lower portion being used for
wood and washroom, while the upper story
was let out to her tenants; a narrow platform
which was reached by a flight of steps at one
end running around beneath the second row
of windows, with half a dozen doors opening
from it into the rooms occupied by them.
Such was the character of the externals of
the Saracens Head.
As Herman approached this rendezvous of
vice, poverty and crime, he instinctively
slackened
his pace; for he did not know but he
might the next moment meet his father, and
the thought made his blood flow quicker while
it produced a certain emotion of reluctance
and awe. Around the door were four or five
persons smoking cigars and talking together.
Two men muffled about the chin and mouth,
and wearing hats pushed down over their
brows, evidently for disguise, stood beneath
the dull lamp which hung above the door of
the `tap,' conversing apart secretly. As
Herman
came up they lowered their voices and
turned their faces away, shaded as the spot
was where they were standing. He knew one
of them, nevertheless, disguised as he was,
and approaching him he laid his hand
suddenly
upon his arm. The man started back,
and throwing himself into an attitude of
defence
,
half unsheathed a knife, the steel of
which flashed on the eyes of De Ruyter. His
companion at the same moment drew from
beneath his jacket a short, loaded cudgel and
held it above his head.
`Wilkins, is this the way to welcome an
old acquantance,' said Herman in a lively
tene and a pleasant laugh, without betraying
the least fear at their menacing demeanor.
`Who the deuce are you?' demanded the
man he addressed, slowly shoving back his
knife into its sheath and eyeing him closely.
`If you know me, you ought to know it is
dangerous for a man to come up and lay a
hand upon me in that way by surprise. I might
take his life before I knew whether he was
friend or foe! Who are you?'
`Herman de Ruyter,' he answered, firmly.
`
Herman!
' cried the burglar captain with
a recognition of surprise and pleasure. And
seizing him by the extended hand he warmly
shook it. `You are the last man I expected
to see here! No wonder I didn't know you
You were but seventeen when we last met and
now you are full three and twenty! But
your way of carrying yourself is just the
same, and you have an eye no man could
mistake
who had once seen it! You knew me
readily. If I have been so easily detected I
am not safe here!'
`I heard your voice first, and then looking
at you closely I recognised you. Perhaps I
houldn't have noticed you if I had not heard
you speak!'
`Softly,' said the burglar captain,
lowering
his voice.
`Come into the tap, Herman, my boy, and let
us know where you've been! You are the
very man I would rather see than all others!
By the by, this is my particular friend
Napes
!'
Herman shook Mr. Napes by the hand and
then followed his two friends into the coffee
house, by descending four well-worn steps,
the tap being three feet lower than the level
of the street. The door was carefully closed
by Wild, and being half glass was habitually
guarded by a faded red curtain drawn across
the panes. The door on the other street
was arranged with an under curtain in the
same manner; thus the orgies going on
within, could not be overlooked, or rather
looked down upon by those passing on the
walk. The apartment into which Herman
descended was a large sized room,
remarkable
for its time-worn and smoky aspect, and
for the lowness of its blackened ceiling. Its
floor had been sanded, the time when being
doubtful, but the sand had now united with
the dirt brought in by the feet of Dirk Dilley's
guests and covered the boards with a hard
cement not unlike a macadamised surface.
Over this was strewn bits of half-smoked
cigars
,
fragments of refreshments, and around
the bar at the opposite end it was damp with
water and other liquids spilled or dashed upon
it. There were little blue tables ranged around
the sides of the room, and every one of them
was occupied by hard looking characters,
some card-playing, others drinking and
puffing
at short pipes or detestable cigars, others
with their heads bent close together
conversing
in low, cautious tones. A steady buzz,
mingled with oaths of the most horrible
character
and language singularly vile, filled the
room, alternated with loud calls for glasses of
wine or tumblers of spirits.
Dame Dilley stood behind her bar the
presiding
genius of this bacchanalian scene. Her
appearance presented a striking contrast to
all around her. She was a young woman
not more than five or six and twenty, and still
remarkably handsome, with a clear hazel eye,
dark shining hair, and a superb figure. She
was dressed in a tight-fitting black velvet
spencer, with a green silk skirt, and a
necklace
of sparkling stones encircled her
well-turned
neck. She was at once beautiful and
wicked; for the seal of vice was impressed
upon her fine face in lines that could not be
mistaken. In a word the hostess of the
Saracen's
Head was Isabel Wild, once the wife of
the burglar captain. After his sentence to
seven
years in the States Prison**, her marriage
with him was, by the law, annulled. She passed
through various vicissitudes the past two or
three years of her separation, but in all her
circumstance was remarkable for her bold,
daring and independent spirit, and a
propensity
to defy the law by engaging in lawless
enterprizes
.
Indeed, she took for a time the
position
Wilkins Wild had held and was
virtually
the head of a band of burglars for whom
she planned enterprizes, being artful, bold and
most accomplished in the management of
conspiracies
against the property of honest
citizens
.
One of these, by the name of Dilley,
she married; but he was shot not long
afterwards in breaking into a Doctor's house
in Washington square. Avarice grew with
her acquisitions and her depredations through
the skilful persons she had in her employ at
length rendering her discovery and arrest an
object of great importance to the police, she
resolved to abandon her career as a
successful
female burglar, and invest her money,
while she could do it safely in a way that
would enable her to enrich herself. At first
she opened a boarding house for the friends of
`the art,' as she termed burglary, charging
them a high price for the advantages she could
afford them by her protection, as well as by her
advice; and ultimately she got to eharging a
fee for consultation upon nice points touching
any contemplated `descent.' But she
carefully
kept herself from all participation in the
acts themselves. By degrees her boarding
house assumed the character of a tavern, and
finding the Saracen's Head to rent, she
removed
there about three years after Wilkins
had been sentenced to Sing-Sing, and
gradually
increasing the number of her rooms, she
had at length got under her domestic
government
quite a colony to which she was a most
exacting and uncompromising governor. In
the collection of her rents, or bills for lodging
or board, Isabel Dilley knew no pity. The
last loaf of bread or the last blanket that
appertained
to her poor tenants she would seize
without mercy if the hour of her dues came
and there was not money enough to pay.
As she stood now in her bar, not serving
herself so much as overseeing the movements
of a young girl who was in the bar with her,
her hard cold, yet handsome eye, betrayed to
a close observer all the iron-coldness of her
nature. Yet it was not her nature. Isabel
Wild was not always such as she now was;
and under other circumstances might have
made a noble woman. But early temptation
and fall had reversed her character, and from
a high-spirited girl, made a dangerous and
guilty woman!
As Herman followed Wild up to the bar,
she fixed upon him her quick glance, and a
look of surprise and searching scrutiny of his
features followed. He at once recognized her
and turned to Wilkins, exclaimed,
`There is your wifeIsabel?'
`Not my wife now,' answered Wild
laughing
,
yet looking confused and displeased.
`The state's prison gave us a bill of divorce!
She has recognized you, and beckons to me
to bring you there!'
Wild led Herman by the side of the bar
into
a small setting room, into which Isabel
instantly came.
`Is it possible,' she exclaimed with a
smiling
countenance, as she stopped a moment to
survey Herman, `is it possible Wild, you have
brought little Herman here! It is he! That
smile and glance no body can mistake! How
handsome and tall you've grown! she added
as she approached him, and laid her hand
upon
his shoulder. `Where have you been?'
`At sea!'
`Under the free flag, hey?' she said
laughing
.
`No,' replied Herman. `I have been part
the time in a merchantman, and a part of the
time in a man-of-war. I only got back from
my last cruise to-night, and I want you to tell
me, Isabel, where I can find my mother?'
`
Isabel!
I like
that!
You remind me of old
times, Herman;' she said as if pleased. `How
very fine looking you are! Your seaman's
dress is truly becoming, and you wear it with
such an air! Come, we must be good friends
again, now you have got back. So you were
kind to come and see me first! Have you
been to supper?'
`Yes, before I came ashore!' answered
Herman
,
gratified at the warm reception by her.
`I cannot stop a moment either, as I am
anxious
to see my mother!'
`Your mother! Bless me, you are too old
to ask after your mother, Herman, she said
laughing. `She is n't living is she?'
`Yes, and is in the city!'
`Well, I did not know it! Besides I never
saw her in my life! Where are you going to
stop while you are here? You must remain at
the Saracen! I have a neat room for you, and
you will feel perfectly at home!'
`Well, I will accept your kind offer,' said
Herman, `until I ascertain where my mother
is!'
`Bel,' said Wild in an imperious tone, `bring
us in three glasses of your best. We will
drink together in here, where it is private!'
`Who do you order in that manner, sir?'
asked the hostess of the Saracer, her large
eyes flashing, and her fine lip curling with
contempt. `Your old tones wont do with me
now, Wilkins? If you wish me to be your
friend, you will be less haughty. We are
two
now! If I suffer you to lodge here for old
acquaintance
sake till you can do better, it is
not for you to think that I am your wife!'
`Dont be angry, Isabel,' said Wild trying
to laugh, though his brow darkened. `We
will keep friends! Come, my dear, get us
the three glasses, and a fourth too, for
yourself
!'
`No, I will take a glass, with a cup of tea,
by and by alone with Herman!'
`
Alone
with Herman, eh!' repeated Wild
in a sarcastic tone, and with a look that
showed
,
that notwithstanding his present relative
position with regard to her, he was jealous of
her very apparent regard for Herman.
She smiled with wicked triumph in her eye,
and entering the bar, in a few moments
returned
with the glasses and placed them upon
the table before them. As she retired from
the room, Wild rose up and followed her to
the door of the bar.
`Isabel!'
`Well, Wild?'
`I see how the wards lay, and have a key
in my eye that unlocks all your thoughts! I
understand what you mean to be at!'
`Well, what is it?'
`You know Herman is rich, and will soon
have his money. You see he is devilish good
looking. So you mean to play a double game;
getting him fascinated with you to gratify
your vanity, and then work him out of his
money!'
`If I thought it would make you jealous,
nothing would please me more, Wild, than to
fall in love with him. The truth is I am
almost
in love with him; and I tell you plainly
if I can catch him I will marry him!'
`Do as you please, only beware!' said Wild,
his fine, yet vice-hardened face glowing with
anger. `But look you, woman! About his
money, there are two to play at that game!'
`How do you mean?'
`If you make me jealous of him, I will so
manage my cards, that you shall not touch a
dollar of his money. I know your avarice is
stronger than your love, and so take heed! I
do not, you well know, threaten lightly! If
you wish to profit by his return, you must
make me your friend!'
`Well, Wilkins, I will not do any thing to
vex you! The truth is I do love you still;
but then my hatred of you for deceiving and
degrading me in the first, is so much stronger
than love, that sometimes it will come to the
surface; and then I feel as I could do any
thing to make you suffer in soul and body!'
`Never make me jealous, Isabel!' said Wild
in a stern tone, depressed so as not to be
overheard
by Herman and Napes. `If I can be
nothing more to you again than another man,
no other shall share your affections. Dont
touch your dirk! It will not intimidate me! I
am as desperate and determined as hell itself
on that point. So if you would not make me
your enemy, beware!'
He then turned away from her, while with
a pale cheek yet flashing eyes she entered her
bar.
`You and Dirk Dilley seem to have been at
words,' said Napes, as Wild sat down by the
table and raised his glass.
`You seem to have been listening,'
retorted
Wild ill-humoredly. `But let us drink,'
he said his brow clearing up. Come,
Herman
,
here is to your health!'
`Wilkins,' said Herman as he sat down his
glass, can you tell me if' and here looking
doubtfully at Napes he lowered his tone and
and added`if my
father
is in the city!'
`Bless me! I never thought of it before!
That is true sure enough! What a meeting
it would be! I should like to be present at
it!'
`He is here then?'
Yes. But talk freely; don't be afraid of
Napes. He knows all about you and the old
'un too! He's served his
three years!
.
`Have you seen him?'
`Not half an hour ago. I dare say he is
about now! I will see!'
`Noby no means!' cried Herman
catching
him by the arm and detaining him. `I
have not seen my father since I was a lad. I
do not wish him to know me when we do
meet! Yet I would like to see him!'
`You shall see him. He lodges here. He
has a room with Napes in the court-yard right
over the arch. We will go up all three to
his room soon and see him. I will call you
Corney. He has heard me speak of such a
person and won't suspect!'
`Thank you, Wilkins,' said Herman with
an earnest voice. `I don't want him to know
me, at least, yet!'
`Well, now let us have a little talk
together
.
How are you as it regards the old trade?'
`I have done with all that, Wilkins! I had
enough when I was a boy in that way to serve
me!'
`Yes, you used to do service! By the by,
was Shears killed before or after you left the
city? Oh, I remember it was about the time;
for you were together a night or two before!
That was the strangest affair!'
`It was,' responded Napes with emphasis.
`I would give a hundred dollars to know how
the poor fellow came by his death!'
`Has the person never been suspected?'
asked Herman with as much composure as he
could assume at such a moment.
`Never! unless it was a little girl whom he
was known to take into the carriage with him.
It seems impossible it could have been this
child; and that afterwards she should cut her
way through the leather at the back of the
coach. Yet the child disappeared at the same
time as if guilty; and her father or uncle,
Mr. Carrol, used every means to ascertain
what had become of her. It is a
confoundedly
mysterious affair!'
`So it is,' warmly answered Napes, who
was a young, slender, pale faced man of thirty,
in a gray jacket buttoned to his chin, with
black, straight hair, cut very short to his head,
and eyes large, green, and consumptive
looking
.
His countenance was expressive of the
most hardened villany, Every feature
seemed
to be attenuated and sharpened by
duplicity
and cunning. He spoke through his nose,
and had a habit of jirking the corner of his
mouth towards his left ear; and a look of
cautious watchfulness was so habitual to him
that one could not behold him without
irresistably
thinking of a cat.
Herman kept his countenance with
remarkably
coolness, and said quietly.
`It is very singular. I heard of the facts
before I left.'
`Shears was one in a thousand,' said Wild
with admiration in his tones, as he recalled
the many virtues of the skillful burglar. `I
would not have lost him for a good deal of
money. Well, Herman, I suppose you are
soon to be rich! I am not mistaken, hey?'
`I was to have about twenty thousand
dollars
when I came of age, which was nearly
two years ago. I hope it is now safe; though
if I hear rightly my mother is in the city and
in poverty.'
`It can't be true! But you will find her
tomorrow
,
by dropping a line in the office. So
you will cut us all after you get your money,
I dare say.'
No, I shall not cut you,' he answered
smiling; `but there will be no need I should
take a hand with you.'
`Ah, the same old frank, bold spirit, I see!
You are Herman still! Going to sea hasn't
spoiled you.'
`It has made me reflect a good deal. I
intend
to stay ashore quietly, marry and live as
happily as I can.'
`Here's to your good resolutions,' cried
Wells filling his glass.
At this moment a noise without and a loud
shriek caused them to rise and rush
precipitately
into the tap-room.
CHAPTER III.
The Forget-me-Not.
Before explaining the scene that met the
eyes of Herman and the others upon entering
the tap-room, we will first take the reader to
the tenement occupied by Mrs. de Ruyter and
her young friend, the lovely cigar vender.
This abode was situated upon a narrow street,
or rather alley, not far distant from the `
Saracen's
Head,' and in a quarter where the poor
congregated on account of the lowness
of the rents, though such places as
they inhabited scarcely were decent enough
to bring any rent at all to their avaricious
landlords. Upon the second floor of an old
black wooden house, Mrs. de Ruyter had
hired a room for herself and her protege. It
was furnished in the humblest manner, and
one bed in the room served for her and the
maiden. In spite of the poverty which
manifested
itself in the chamber, there was an air
of neatness that pervaded the whole. Maria
had been then a few weeks in the cigar store,
and her little wages had been cheerfully
contributed
towards the comfort of her
fostermother
;
and the appearance of things was
now quite genteel, though indigent still,
compared
with what they had been before the
young girl obtained this uncertain situation.
There was a small mirror over a table covered
with neat white dimity, and a white coverlid
to the bed, and clean curtains to the two low
windows; all of which were presents from
Maria, made out of the avails of her weekly
wages.
It was a little after nine o'clock in the
evening
,
and about the time that Herman had
entered the tap of the Saracen's Head, that
Mrs. de Ruyter was seated at table sewing by
a small lamp. Upon a seat a little lower and
close by her side sat the lovely girl, whom we
have chosen as the heroine of our tale. The
rays of the lamp fell softly upon her pure
forehead, on either side of which the fair
brown hair was modestly parted, and put
behind
the ears, fell in two or three natural curls
upon her neck. She was reading a letter
aloud; and, as at intervals, she would lift up
her eyelids from the paper, and fixed her deep
blue eyes upon the face of her maternal friend,
to listen to some remark she made upon the
contents of the epistle, the expression was
heavenly from its innocence and purity. As
she read, a sweet ever-dwelling smile played
about her mouth. She was very beautiful; but
it was the beauty of the retiring daisy, rather
than of the glowing rose. She was attired
with great simplicity in a muslin dress, with
a pink flower in it, and in her bosom was
stuck a sprig of myrtle and forget-me-not. As
she read, she rested her arm upon the lap of
Mrs. de Ruyter, and seemed to nestle by her,
as if she were her mother indeed. Her voice
as she read was sweetly toned, and, at times,
was slightly tremulous; for she was reading
over again, at Mrs. de Ruyter's request, the
last letter received many months before from
Herman, dated at Valparaiso, and there
were passages in it breathing the most
passionate
tenderness towards her.
`Nay, read that passage over again, dear,'
said Mrs. de Ruyter, laying down her work
upon her knee, and fixing her eyes upon the
letter, `read it again, my child!'
`Never forget, my dear mother,' obeyed the
maiden, and blushing as she obeyed, `that
Maria must be regarded by you as your own
child, as you promised me when I parted from
you. She is very,
very
dear to me! I love
her as a sister, as more than a sister; and it
is only the hope, that one day I may be united
to her by a bond still tenderer than that of
brotherly love, that leads me onward in my
career of usefulness! But for her I feel I
should, forover, have cast myself away on
learning my father's crime. But I feel
differently
when I think of Maria. Her
image
'
`Why do you stop, my child? These
words are very sweet to my heart, and I know
you will rejoice to be so loved by my boy!
See what you have done, my dear, by your
gentle and silent influence! Herman
confesses
he owes his safety from the gulf of
crime to you! If any thing could make me
love you more than I do, my child, it is this
reflection!' And the grateful mother of the
wandering boy, placed both her hands upon
the head of the sweet maiden, and raising her
eyes to Heaven, called fervently for its
blessing
upon her!
Maria sat pale and silent. She looked
distressed
and said hurriedly,
`I will not read any more to-night, dear
mother, if you will excuse me. The light is
dim and I do not feel quite well.'
`Then fold up the dear boy's letter. I
know you have to work hard all day and stay
until eight o'clock and sometimes later in the
evening. I don't wonder your head aches. The
smell of so much tobacco would make mine
ache constantly. Besides you have'nt been
home long enough to get rested. There, the
lamp is going out! I forgot to get any oil to
day, and I must have this gown finished to
night for Mrs. Gillin's little girl to put on in
the morning. Will you remain here, alone
dear, while I go to the store on the corner
over against the Saracen's Head.'
`You must not go, mother,' said Maria
rising quickly, and taking the little oil pitcher
from her hand.'
`But you are too tired walking all the way
from the shop in Broadway down here, and
only been in about twenty minutes.'
`No, I can go very well. It is but a step,'
she said cheerfully; and throwing her shawl
over her head was going out when the
forget-me-not
fell out of her bosom upon the floor.
She stooped to pick it up when Madam de
Ruyter anticipated her, and as she took it in
her hand before returning it to her, she said,
`This is beautiful, Maria. Where did you
find such a sweet flower? It is a rare sight
for me to see a flower in these days. It
reminds
me of my garden at the old place.
Where did you get it?'
`It was given to me,' answered the maiden,
colouring, and rubbing her eyelids.
`I hope you did not receive it from any of
the young gentlemen who frequent your shop.
I cannot caution you too closely, my sweet
child; about the society you are under the
necessity
of seeing there. Nay, don't look
grieved
!
You are a good girl, and know propriety
as well as I do. There it is, dear Maria! If
you don't care to tell how you came by it, I
will not press you,' added Mrs. de Ruyter
kindly. `I
know
you would not have
received
it from any young man, especially after
Herman's letter.'
`I am afraid the lamp will go quite out
before
I can get back with the oil,' said Maria,
placing the flower in her bosom beside the
sprig of myrtle; and, without making any
further reply, she left the room and closed
the door. With difficulty she found her way
down a crooked and dilapidated staircase, and
as she reached the street door, she said
internally
to herself,
`This is the last night I shall have to go in
and out of this wretched place. The two
pretty rooms in Nassau street I have engaged,
and secretly furnished with my wages, will
be ready tomorrow afternoon; and then how
I shall surprise my dear Mrs. de Ruyter by
taking her there to see them, and then telling
her they are her own! I can almost see her
happy and grateful countenance beaming
upon me with thankfulness and love. Ah,
this flower! I wonder if she suspected truly
the truth! Oh
if
she knew, she would be
very angry with me! But how
could
I refuse
him? so noble in looks, so agreeable, so
handsome
!
and I know he is so generous and good!
And how should I have answered my mother,
when I know not even his name myself?'
With these pleasant thoughts of some one
who is yet a stranger to us, but of whom the
maiden knew more than she was willing to
confide to her, from whom, up to this time, she
had kept no emotion of her heart; she tripped
lightly along the murky side-walk, her
delicate
features nearly concealed by the shawl
which she drew closely down over her
forehead
,
and round her chin; for the walk was
thronged with idlers of all classes who were
lounging about, or coming in and out of the
low lodging-houses and tippling-cellars that
lined the way. She proceeded very rapidly
along on her errand, fearing to be accosted by
some rude person, and was passing the long
row of tenements composing the `Saracen's
Head,' when the door of the tap-room opened,
and a man was coming out, when the glare
falling directly upon the face of Maria as she
tripped past, revealed to him a glimpse of its
beauty.
`Ha, my bright eyes!' he cried with
drunken
triumph, as he sprung and seized hold of
her shawl, `let us have a sight of that pretty
face.'
The maiden alarmed uttered a half-cry, and
releasing the shawl to his grasp, fled towards
the grocery. As she was leaving the
curbstone
to cross the street to it, another person
who had seen the act of the man, suddenly
placed himself in her way, and with outspread
arms tried to receive her flying, form. She
turned from him, now fairly affrighted, and
was about to escape by turning down the
street, up which a little before Herman had
come from the bookman's stall, when a third
person, seeing her terror, intercepted her
course, and attempted to pass his arm around
her graceful waist. At this instant, when all
hopes of avoiding the rude insults of these
desperadoes seemed gone, the other door of
the tap was thrown open by a woman, who
was coming out with a bottle in her hand. At
the sight of one of her sex, and the open door,
the alarmed girl sprung towards her.
`Protect me, good woman, from these
wretches!' she cried, clinging to her.
`Och, and what is it ye fare from the min'?'
demanded the woman coarsely in a strong
Irish brogue. `Don't be afther claverin' me
wid yer hands!' and thus speaking, she drew
back from her. At the same moment the man
who had first alarmed her came up, and was
laying his hand upon her arm, when she
pushed
past the unfeeling Irish woman into the tap,
and sprung down the two steps through the
still open door into the smoky and crowded
room. No sooner did she discover the
character
of the place she had sought shelter in, than
she trembled with renewed apprehensions, and
was about to fly through the door again past
the men who were entering after her, when
she was caught by the wrist, and drawn
forcibly
back into the room.
`Here is a canary bird that has broke loose
from its cage!' cried the fellow who had
seized
her. `Don't sing so loud, pretty one,
nobody
is deaf here!' But the voice of the
terrified
girl rose louder, shriek after shriek, for
three cut-throat looking villains had hold of
her, and knives were already drawn above her
head in fierce rivalry for the possession of
her.
It was the shrieks of the trembling girl that
reached the ears of Herman, the burglar
Captain
and Napes in the little back room of the
tavern, and which led them to leave their
glasses, and rush out to ascertain the cause.
The room being illy lighted, and its
atmosphere
thick with tobacco smoke, and the
inmates
of the tap thronging towards the door
to see what was going on, Herman at first was
unable to discover the cause. But being one
of those ready spirits that are ever foremost in
a quarrel or a scene of excitement, he pressed
his way through the crowd, imperiously
saying
,
as he did so,
`Stand aside, fellow! Clear the passage
here! Give me room, villains!' And in this
way helping his words with strong arms, he
soon reached the scene. There was a
battered
japan lamp hanging just above the door,
and casting its light down upon the spot where
the maiden stood pale as marble, and
trembling
with apprehension. Two men now only
had hold of her, one grasping each arm, while
with knives brandished in the air, they stood
eyeing each other with fierce and murderous
hate.
`By Heaven I will kill the girl unless you
let go of her, Plymp!' vociferated one of them,
and he lowered his knife till the point hung
just above her bosom.
`Let go of her yourself, Flash,' cried the
other furiously. `She is mine, for I first saw
her. Let go her, or I will kill
you
!'
Herman came at this near enough to see the
features of the young girl, over whom this
desperate quarrel was going on; and instantly
all the blood in his heart rushed to his brain.
Could it be possible? The features pale and
alarmed as their expression was, were those
which he had carried with him in `in his
heart of hearts,' during all his wild
wanderings
.
Changed and far more beautiful they
were, but they were the same as those of the
lovely child who had so generously saved him
from arrest by concealing him in her closet!
the same, but more matured, of the sweet
maid of fifteen whom he had two years before
parted from with tenderness, and in tears.
The situation of any young and lovely
female
in such peril, would, under any
circumstances
,
have called forth the chivalrous
interference
of the young sailor. How much more
when he recognised in her the features of the
one he loved best on earth! The recognition
acted upon his brain with the force of a blow
being given upon the temples. He staggered
a step backwards! but instantly recovering
himself as he saw the dreadful situation she
was in, he uttered a loud cry, so loud and
terrible
that those around him started aside; and
as a lion leaps upon his prey, he leaped
bounded upon these men. He had no weapon
in his grasp! He seized a hand of each of
them, heedless of their knives, and bending
the wrists till they relaxed their brutal hold
upon her shoulders, he hurled them both from
him, one to this side, and the other that, as if
they had been children in his grasp; and with
the same act he threw his arm around the half
lifeless maiden and drew her closely to his
side, and with the other arm presented in
fierce defiance, he cried,
`Stand back, ruffians, both of ye,
all
of ye!
He who lays a hand upon this young girl is a
dead man!'
The two men recovering themselves, and
seeing him unarmed, sprung at him together
with their gleaming blades, when Wild and
Napes caught their hands and held them, each
securing one of them.
`How is this, PlympFlash! Put up your
knives, would you kill the best fellow that
ever worked a clasher?'
`
He?
' cried Plymp, in a tone of contempt.
`He a clasher?'
`Yes, and one of us, and the girl is his
sister
!
So quit this game, and be hanged to
you!'
`Just as you say, Wilks,' answered Plymp,
sheathing his weapon, and followed in the act
by Flash, while both closely regarded
Herman
.
`Who is he, Wild?' asked Flash, a short,
fat young man of five or six and twenty,
dressed in a torn bottle-green coat worse for
wear; a soiled claret-velvet waistcoat, and
buff cassimere pants much too tight for his
legs, and a threadbare greasy blue broadcloth
cap, jauntily worn to one side, with a faded
gold tassel dangling over his left ear.
`Aye,
who
is he, Wilks? I'm blowed if I
knows him!' repeated the other gentleman,
shutting up his left eye, and eyeing Herman
inquisitively with the right. This
interrogator
was endowed with a bright red
complexion
,
sandy hair, and two monstrous whiskered
warts on his chin, which otherwise had no
beard. His nose was half gone, a mouthful
having been taken from its extremity by a
bull-dog which had seized him by that
member
,
as he was entering through a store
window
in the way of his profession, which was
that of a burglar. Plymp, for that was the
name of this personage, had also but a part of
an ear, the residue having been left on a post,
to which he was nailed in Virginia for
slave-stealing
,
and from which durance he escaped
minus the portion of cartilage in question. He
was a savage-looking fellow, tall and
ill-jointed
,
with a huge red freckled hand, that
looked
as if it could fell a horse with a single blow
of it clenched. The attire of this ruffian
consisted
of a stout drab box-coat, cut very close
in the skirts, and buttoned to his chin, the
collar standing up above his ears; and a pair
of blue check trowsers, rolled up over the top
of thick-soled boots. A cap not unlike a
fireman's
,
save that it wanted the capo, was
lowered
over his assassin-like eyes, and gave him
at once a revolting and wicked aspect.
`Come to Napes' room both of you, and I
will tell you, boys,' answered Wild in a
conciliating
tone, speaking low `Depend upon
it he is one of us, and you will find it for your
interest to be friends with him. You have
seen already he has the courage of an eagle,
and that he would make a dangerous foe!'
`Well, if you say so, Wilks, I am content!
I can't go to Napes' room to-night, as Flash
and I have a little fancy work cut out, and I
was going to look after it when I saw this
pretty wench, who has made such a muss,
tripping by like a kitten going wisitin' of a
Sunday afternoon. If she is his sister, then
I'm sorry. So, comrade, give us your
flipper
!'
he said, addressing Herman, who had
all this time been soothing and encouraging
his recovered treasure; for she seemed to him
ready each moment to sink to the ground,
being
yet ignorant who her timely friend was,
and fearing still that she was in the grasp of
one from whom she had quite as much to fear
as from the others; for, in the confused state
of her faculties, she had been hardly conscious
of what actually passed around her while
Herman was rescuing her.
`Revive, and speak for my sake, dearest
Maria!' he said, with anxiety and deep
tenderness
,
as he gazed upon her marble and still
features. `It is Herman who speaks to you!
Herman who holds you!'
`I say, friend, give us your fives,' repeated
Plymp, in a louder tone. `No harm meant,
and none done, I hope!'
`Stand back, fellow, and don't
friend
me!'
cried Herman angrily. `When I cross hands
with thee, it shall be as thy foe, and with a
knife in them; for I mean yet to wipe out the
insult you have put upon this fair girl, by
laying your savage grasp upon her person!
Away, I want nothing with you! Throw
open the door some of you and give her
air!'
He was obeyed, and bearing his burden to
the open passage, she felt the night-air upon
her brow and lifted her eyelids. He bore her
in his arms out of the sunken tap, and gained
the side-walk with her. Flash and Plymp
would have rushed after him, but Wild placed
himself against the door which he had shut
the instant Herman had got out.
`This game won't do, master,' cried the
burglar, with a terrific oath. `Give back and
leave the way free, or I will pin you to the
door as I would a beetle!'
Wild fixed his eye steadily upon those of
the burglar, and said with a firm voice,
`Plymp, I do not fear your knife, so put it
up. The young man who has gone out came
in with me, and I will not suffer him to come
to harm. If you want me to serve you again,
or to be friends with me, you had best let this
matter pass in a quiet way. It is true I am
not your Captain as I once was; but you
know that I am preparing to organise again,
and that you are to be my `
first
.' So be
peaceable. This stranger you will yet say is
a trump!'
`Who is he, then?' asked Plymp, sullenly.
`Aye, who is the chap, Captain?' echoed
Flash, in a swaggering way.
`He is a lad who served his aprenticeship
with me, and has to-night just got back from
a long cruise in other lands. That girl is his
sister,' added Wild, who, however, only
guessed at this conjecture from Herman's
manner towards her. He had seen her
features
,
and was struck not only with their
finished
beauty, but also with a startling
resemblance
to somebody or other he had seen
before
;
a resemblance that greatly perplexed
him, and with which something or other was
associated which he could not clearly and
distinctly
recal from the past.
After a few more words interchanged aside
between the two burglars and Wild, the
former
left the tap together, as they said, to
proceed
on a private burglarious expedition of
their own; while the latter following them
out, said he would go and see how his friend
got home with his sister, and give him a
helping
hand if it were needed.
CHAPTER IV.
The meeting and interview.
The
night air served to revive the lovely
girl whom Herman had so courageously
rescued
from the ruffians in the tap-room of the
Saracen's Head; and after he had supported
her a few steps along the side-walk with his
arm around her, she stopped, and drawing
back, said faintly,
`Sir, you are very kind, but I can proceed
alone. It is but a few steps. You are very
good to do what you have for me.'
`Maria, is it possible you do not know me,'
exclaimed Herman with suspicion. `It is
me
Herman.'
`Then it was not a confused dream of my
bewildered brain as I was in that horrible den.
I thought I heard and knew your voice,' she
cried with joy. `Herman it
is
you,' she added,
looking up into his face as the street lamp fell
upon it and revealed the look of tenderness
and love with which his eyes were bent on
her. And taking both his hands between
hers she pressed them with the warmth of
sisterly affection. `How happy you will make
your mother.'
`Is she well, Maria?' he asked eagerly.
`Yes, and lives but a few steps off.'
`I will hasten to see her. But how is it I
found you there! How is it I have met you
in this situation? Why is it you are in New
York at all?' he asked with a tone of anxiety.
`In a few words she told him the object of
her errand and how she had been insulted and
driven into the Saracen's Head for shelter and
protection.'
`Sad protection you were likely to find
there,' he said as she ended. `Thank God I
was near you to save you from these villains.'
`I can never be too grateful to you
Herman
,
she answered with warmth. `Come,
here is the door.'
`This? What a wretched abode! Is my
mother so poor?' he exclaimed with pain as
he surveyed the wretched exterior of the
habitation
.
`Yes, Herman, she is very poor! But you
shall know all when you have seen your
mother. Let me go first in and break the
news or her heart will break for joy on seeing
you.'
`That is right and prudent, just like
yourself
,
dear Maria,' he said pressing a kiss upon
her brow as they stood together in the
doorway
.
She shrunk instinctively from him so
that he could not but observe and speak of it:
`You did not
once
shrink from my kiss,
Maria
?'
`We were children then, Herman! But let
us not quarrel
now
,' she said with a pleasant
laugh. `I will run up and tell mother the
good news.'
`And I will go into the next shop and
purchase
some candles as you say there is no light
up stairs.'
`You are very kind, dear Herman,' she said
as she tripped lightly up the dark stair way.
`
Dear
Herman,' he sottly repeated to
himself
.
`That little phrase makes all square
again! I had began to fear she might have
found somebody during my absence she loved
quite as well as Herman! Her refusing a kiss
was only maiden coyness; and as she says,
she is not a child now, she is a lovely girl
indeed
!
She has grown taller and fairer! I
begin
to think she is too far above me she looks
so lovely and pure and good.'
Thus reflecting within himself he went and
purchased the candles, and having lighted one
he returned to the door where he found Maria
waiting for him.
`Have you broken it to her?' he asked
eagerly
.
`Yes; gently as I could.'
`And where is she?'
`On her knees in prayer waiting for you.'
Herman felt his bosom glow with the fire of
filial devotion and awe when he heard these
words and reverently ascended the stairs
preceded
by Maria carrying the lighted candle.
She opened the door and standing aside let
him enter. Mrs. De Ruyter rose from her
knees and unclasping her hands stood gazing
an instant and then rushed towards him.
`My son! my boy! my Herman.'
`Mother, dear mother.'
For a few moments mother and son stood
locked
in each others arms in silence, and both in
tears, while Maria freely wept for joy. At length
composure was restored to each and the three
sat down, the mother by her long absent boy's
side, his hand in hers her eyes on his, and the
maiden upon a low stool a little removed from
them, and gazing upon both with looks of equal
affection. They listened to his brief account
of his voyage home and his arrival that even
ing in port and then how he happened to meet
with Maria so singularly while he was
searching
for them without any clue to direct his
steps.
`But it was certainly very imprudent, dear
mother, for you to let Maria go out at such an
hour in a neighborhood like this.'
`I would have gone, Herman dear, but she
would not suffer me to.'
`And I am used to being out after dark,
Herman,' said the maiden smiling.
`How and for what?'
`Because Maria has a place, Herman, and
she seldom leaves it till eight o'clock and
sometimes stays later.'
`A place! I don't understand you! But
now I think again where I am and look at this
wretched chamber I begin to comprehend! Is
it possible Maria works out as a servant.'
`Not that, oh no, Herman,' exclaimed his
mother.
`Then do explain one of you,' he cried
impatiently
,
and looking from one to the other.
`How is it you are in New York! How is it
you are so poorso utterly destitute! I
learned
something of this from Rolfe the
Book-man
!'
`Rolfe the Book-man,' repeated Maria in a
voice of surprise and a look of alarm, while
her color fled.
`Yes. He first told me that you were here,
dear mother, in this city, though I could
hardly
believe it, and had seen you pass in the garb
of poverty; and he also described a young
girl who I know now was Maria.'
Herman did not take notice of the effect his
words in allusion to Rolfe had upon Maria,
being too deeply interested to have an answer
to his inquiries.
`There is a long and sad story, Herman, my
son! You must make up your mind to suffer
a great disappointment.'
`There is but one thing that can be a
subject
of disappointment to me in this life,
mother,' he said bending his warm glance
upon the maiden, who feeling it dropped her
eyes and looked distressed. `Let your story
be short and let me hear the worst. So it does
not affect you and Maria I am careless of the
consequences.'
`Then know, Herman, that Mr. Waldeigh
has proved unfaithful! He has failed and
become
bankrupt, and every dollar of your
money with the income you reserved for my
use is lost. It was this that led me to come
to New York and which has reduced us to
the indigence you find us in.'
`Is this man living?' demanded Herman
after a few moments severe thought; for the
intelligence produced no other effect upon him
than darkening his brow and compressing his
lips. `Is this manthis Mr. Waldeigh, my
trustee, living.'
`Yes; and rumour says he is still rich. I
have been several times to see him, but could
never gain admittance. He did leave the
city at one time, but returned again.'
`Very well, dear mother, let him drop
just
now,' he said in a quiet manner. `Something
must be done to make you and Maria more
comfortable! This house will never do.
Fortunately
I have six hundred dollars of my own
with me, and this is yours, mother?
Tomorrow
I will have you out of this hole!'
`Now then, I will tell you, Herman and
mother, also, what I have been doing,' said
Maria with a brightening smile, and blushing
at the reflection of her own good act, `I meant
to surprise dear mother, but as you have come
I may as well tell!'
`Ah, something good I know that, my
beloved
child,' said Mrs. de Ruyter with kindly
praise; `You are always trying to make me
happy. Well, child, God will reward you!
You will never suffer while you love so to
provide for the happiness of those around
you!'
`You think too much of the little I can do
for you, mother! I have received since my
tenth year all I have had from you! I can
repay you nothing in all that I can do. But
I see brother Herman is impatient to know
what great thing I have been doing!'
`I am most impatient to know where you
have a place, and why you have got one!'
answered
Herman.
`You shall soon hear! What I have been
doing is to hire two pleasant rooms in Nassau
street with my wages, which I have furnished
neat and comfortably, and got every thing
ready for dear mother to go with them
tomorrow
!'
`There, Herman!' cried Mrs. de Ruyter
with the deepest admiration and gratitude,
looking first upon Herman and then upon our
heroine, `that is Maria perfectly! You see
from this what she is to me, and what she
has been to me since you left! But for her
life would been dreary. She has been an
angel
beneath my roof!'
`You cannot say one word that will cause
me to think more of Maria than I do now;'
said Herman enthusiastically, and
endeavoring
to pour into her eyes the floods of
affection
(more than
brotherly
) that flowed from
his heart to her own. But she reservedly cast
down the lids, and with a deep blush, said,
`Now, Herman, I will tell you about my
place. I hope you will not blame me if you
do not like it; but then'
`But then what, my daughter? Why do
you begin with an apology? We should have
perished, but that you took this place at the
greatest sacrifice of feeling, from a sacred
sense of duty.'
`Let Maria speak, mother! My heart bleeds
for the suffering that has driven either of you
to any sacrifices.'
`I will speak for her, Herman, for I can
speak best of her good and noble conduct,'
answered Madam de Ruyter. `We were so
reduced, and I being sick, that I had no means
except what Maria's needle earned; and soon
the confinement affected her health; when she
would either have had to give it up, or seek
something else. Well, she saw a place
advertised
in a paper, and thinking, perhaps, she
would just suit it, she applied, and engaged
herself in it without my knowledge. She has
been there now about three months and
received
good wages, and the people are
respectable
and kind to her. The only drawback is
that it is very public, and she has to
encounter
the gaze of young men, and to stay out
late, for she is wanted evenings as well as in
the day. She doesn't, however, go till ten in
the morning, and so she helps me much at
home. You have seen already what she has
done with her wages over what we don't need
to consume.'
`What place is this, mother? a milliner's?'
`No, Herman!'
`Why this hesitation? Is it a tailor's?'
`No!'
`I will tell you, brother,' said Maria calmly,
seeing him surprised and impatient at the
apparent
reluctance of his mother to reveal the
character of the situation she held. `I will
tell you, Herman, and perhaps you may blame
me, as a modest girl, for taking it; but I had
no alternative, and you may be assured that
in no instance have I been treated by any one
who has entered the shop otherwise than with
that respect modesty and a pure heart always
command! The place I am in is a retail
cigar-store
!'
`A retail cigar-store!' he repeated, starting
from his chair. `Maria in a place like that!'
`It is very respectable, Herman,' said his
mother. `It is on Broadway, and only
resorted
to by the most genteel company!'
`Worse and worse, worse and worse!' he
repeated with an angry brow. `I don't know
what else would not have been better!'
`But how could it be helped?' said his
mother sternly. `How could it be helped,
when we were perishing for food?'
`But consider, mother, this young pure girl!
consider Maria so guileless, so beautiful
placed
in a situation surrounded with such great
dangers. Consider the peril to her
reputation
!
Were she fair as the lily, the breath of
slander would blast her fair fame forever! Oh,
Maria! would to God you had reflected, ere
you had taken this step!'
`But, Herman, there was no bread in the
housenay, no house to shelter us. You are
unreasonable.'
`Yes, yes, I know it. I know it, mother,'
he said despondingly and sadly. `I know it.
You were poor, and I your protector was
away. I must blame only myself. But this
is the last day she remains there!' he cried
with determination.
`Nay, dear Herman,' answered Maria
mildly
,
and laying her soft hand gently upon his
shoulder, for he had reseated himself, and sat
with his forehead pressed upon his hand; `I
have yet four days more to complete my first
term of engagement, which was for three
months. Then, if you desire it, prove but
your wishes to me as those of a brother, then
if you wish it I will leave. I should break my
agreement and do Mr. Aan injury by not
going tomorrow.'
`Well, tomorrow and the other three days,
and then no longer,' he said, taking her hand
in his. `You have no idea, Maria, how dear
you are to me, and how fondly I have
cherished
your image in my heart. The idea of
your being exposed to slanderers, surmises,
and the rude impertinence of fashionable fops,
almost makes me mad. But I know you have
conducted yourself like yourself, and as I
would wish to have you under such trying
circumstances. But in a few days it will be
past. Pardon my quickness. Instead of
censuring
you, I ought to kneel to you for your
goodness to my mother. I ought to kneel to
you as the preserver of her life!'
`Nay, Herman, your feelings with
reference
to the exposed situation I hold are
natural
.
Any brother, and are you not my
brother
!
would feel as you do on making the
discovery
.
I have had much to try me there;
but the consciousness that I was serving her
who had been as a mother to me, kept me from
yielding to the tears that a hundred times a
day gushed upwards to my eyes!'
`Then you have often been insulted, or
your feelings have been wounded. They
must have been, though you have said to the
contrary. I wish I knew of one who had
dared
to'
`Herman, be calm!' said Mrs. de Ruyter in
a kind tone. `I know that you have no
reason
to be suspicious in this way. Who,
seeing
Maria's pure face, and looking into her
heavenly blue eyes, where modesty and
virtue
dwell as if in their own home, would
presume
to insult her?'
`I know it, mother; but there are brutes!'
answered Herman, in a deep tone. `But let
this pass. We will have all things smooth
again soon. In four days morenay,
perhaps
,
tomorrow, for I can buy off your time,
Maria, I dare say.'
`I would rather remain till it is out,' said
Maria. `Mr. Ahas been very good to
me, and I ought to give him time to get some
person to supply my place.'
`You are right, Maria, I dare say. Then
let things remain as they are. Tomorrow I
will assist mother to move into your nice
rooms. I can go for you at night to come
home with you. You have not come alone,
and into such a quarter as this, I hope?'
`No, sometimes Mr. Acame with
me, and sometimessometimes' here Maria
hesitated, and then added, `a friend walks
with me to the door.'
He loved Maria with the deepest passion.
Herman was of a quick, jealous
temperament
.
He did not like the word `friend,' and
was about to put some searching inquiry to
her touching her
friends
, when a low tap was
given upon the window; for, although the
room was in the second story of the house, the
street had been so raised that one passing on
the walk, could with ease rap upon the
window-panes
with a stick. It was in this way
the knock was given.
`Who can that he?' said Herman rising,
and looking out. By the faint glimmer of a
street lamp in the next corner, he recognised
the figure of Wilkins Wild who had followed
him from the Saracen's Head Wild
beckored
to him on seeing him.
`Excuse me, I will return in a moment,' he
said, and went down to meet him.
`Ah, me! How that secret knocking
outside
reminds me of old times when Herman
was at home,' sighed Mrs. de Ruyter. `I
trust he has not already fallen in with any of
his old associates. Ah, Maria, I look only to
you to save him from temptation! You heard
now he said he had never ceased thinking of
you, and how your image was graven on his
heart, and how the thought of you kept him
from wickedness when he was tempted to it!
I am so happy to see that he loves you so.
This love for you will be his salvation! All
I wish is to see you married and happy before
I am removed! Did you see how calmly he
took the loss of his money, when I thought he
would rave and storm; and then how
beautifully
he said, only one thing would disappoint
or make him unhappy; and, while he spoke,
he fixed his eyes on you full of hope and love.
I am glad you both love each other, and that
you will, for your own sake too, try to keep
him from temptation now he is back again.'
`I love Herman as a brother, dear mother!'
said Maria, evidently pained at the words of
Madame de Ruyter, and looking distressed.
`I trust he only regards me as a sister.'
`Yes, as a sister, dear, and also as a wife!'
`I can never love Herman other than as a
sister loves a brother, dearest mother!' said
the maiden firmly, but very pale. `If I
thought he regarded me with any tenderer
emotions
than should find a place in a brother's
bosom, I should feel unhappy. But, alas! I
fear he does, and that I shall find unhappiness
and sorrow follow from his error!'
`But Herman looks upon you only as his
future wife, dear Maria! He loves you
devotedly
.
He believes you love him!'
`Then he must be deceived, mother,'
answered
she, with calmness and decision.
`Never breathe it to him, never! If your
feelings are such, never let Herman know
them, child! It would be terrible! I don't
know what he might not do! The idea that
you love him is all that, with his fierce and
intractable nature, that keeps him under any
restraint. But for this belief, I have no doubt
he would have become a pirate in distant seas!
but for it to cheer him now, he will be a
desperate
man! To hear you say what you have
said makes my heart bleed, and wrecks all my
hopes! But, perhaps, you will feel
differently
by and by!'
`Never, dear mother! I love Herman as a
brother! I am grateful to him for his kindness
and attachment to me. But I can only return
him a sister's affection!'
`Then, if you love me, child, keep Herman
ignorant of this. To know it would drive him
to some desperate act! But have you not
another
in your heart, Maria?' she asked, with
sudden questioning of the lovely and
embarrassed
girl.
She was about to make some confused
reply
,
when Herman entered and said he had to
go away on some business, and as he could
not be lodged there, he would return and see
them early in the morning. He then
hurriedly
departed, and the next moment the steps of
two men were heard moving up the street.
CHAPTER V.
The Highwayman.
The
person who had knocked upon the
window, to draw the attention of Herman,
was Wilkins Wild. When Herman went
down to him he was standing upon the
side-walk
,
close by the door.
`Herman,' said he in an eager tone, `you
say you would like to see your father? He
has just gone by towards the Saracen. He
was hurrying so that he did not see me. If
you come with me I can show him to you,
and introduce you as my friend Corney!
He will be in his room, for that is his strong
hold.'
`Thank you, Wilkins. I wish of all things
to meet my father;' answered Herman with
deep emotion. `I will just go in and tell my
mother and
sister
good night!'
Then that was your sister and your
mother
who lives here!' observed Wild, after
Herman had gone up stairs and returned and
taken his arm.
`Yes, I found her through my sister whom
I met so strangely!'
`Then that
was
your sister. Do you know
I think I have seen her before, and under
circumstances that made a deep impression
upon me! Yet it could not be her, but
somebody
very like! Whether it was, in truth, a
person or a picture, I am not certain; but the
face haunts me!'
At his first speaking Herman thought he
might have seen her in a cigar-store, but
when he mentioned a picture, his heart
leap-to
his mouth; for he recollected that Wilkins'
account of the picture of the lovely child he
had seen at Mr. Carroll's, first led him to be
himself interested in her. And he trembled
at the thought that he might, by some
accident
,
make his memory perfect, and fully
identify
Maria as the original of the picture, and,
of course, as the young girl who had so
mysteriously
disappeared at the time of Shears'
murder, and whom Wild had hinted might
have been, possibly, its perpetrator!
To prevent him from dwelling upon this
dangerous subject, which, if pursued and
Maria
identified by him, would place her wholly
in Wild's power, if he chose to use his
information
,
Herman said quietly:
`How did my father look? Was he well
clad?'
`He looked pretty hard used, my boy! But
you will see him for yourself. Here we are
at the Saracen! Come in! Not that door;
but by this private entrance down through
the cellar! He always goes strait to his room
first, and then if he finds the tap is clear he
goes down. Take care of your head as it is
low, and lay your hand upon my shoulder, as
it is as dark as a dungeon! There we are
into
the light again in the court! Now mount
these stairs and step carefully, for they are
ricketty. It is the third door along the
plat-form
!'
`Whose room?'
`Your father's!'
Here Wild struck upon a door twice
heavily
.
`Who is it?' demanded a deep voice within.
`The Captain!'
`Aye, aye! come in,' answered the voice;
and the sound of a bar removed from the door
was heard, and the door cautiously opened a
little ways and the occupant peeped out.
`Two of you!' he said in a surprised tone,
pressing the door closer! `Who is the other?'
`A friend! Corney. You have heard me
speak of him!'
`Yes, yes. Come in both of you.'
And opening the door he let them in, and
carefully closed and barred it after them.
`You are cautious to night, Ruyter!' said
Wild in a careless tone.
`I have been at work and made a miss of
it, and the hounds are abroad!'
`Ah, that is bad! But you are safe enough
here! What have you been doing?'
`I bade a gentleman stand at the corner of
Barclay street, and he gave me his purse with
one hand, knocked me down with the other,
and sung out for the Watch. But I got to
my feet and rolled two of the Charlies into
the gutter, and so got clear!'
`With the purse?'
`Yes! Here it is!' he answered jingling
in his hand a handsome scarlet silk purse.
There is in all thirty dollars in it!'
While he was talking Herman was silently
regarding his father's features. He was seat
ed by a rude table on which burned a tallow
candle in a wooden socket. The light struck
upwards against his features and gave to them
a sharp sinister cast that was revolting. Yet
he could trace in that dark countenance,
disfigured
by uncontrolled evil passions, remains
of manly dignity and beauty. He was a man
about five and forty, heavily framed, and
wearing long grey or black hair flowing upon
his shoulders. His eye brows were thick and
bushy black, and beneath them glowed dark
eyes of the most viciously hardened
expression
.
Crime and years of imprisonment,
during
which he brooded over revenge, had made
the man a demon. Sweet humanity with all
her gentle train seemed banished from his
lineaments
.
He wore a shaggy green box coat
and a red woollen sash was wound about his
neck without a collar. Upon the table by him
was a short club, a pistol, and an old glazed
leather cap, a pair of soiled thick deer-skin
gloves lay by the cap and upon one of them
were stains like blood.
See illustration, page 1.
Herman silently saw all this and then
glanced
his eye around the narrow apartment
occupied
by his father. It contained a rude
double cot-bed, three chairs, a chest and
table
,
all of the meanest description. There
were two square windows in the room, one
looking towards the street, the other into the
court yard. Each window contained but eight
small panes of glass, and was heavily barred
with oaken beams let into sockets. There
were two heavy bars also for the door, one of
which was now only in its place, the other
standing by its side.
`Do you know this man, Ruyter?'
`No. I saw him coming out of the Astor
House and as he looked like a gentleman and
a foreigner I thought I would make a lift by
following him!'
`Here is a name on the silver clasp,' said
Wild taking the purse. `It is
Delorme
! He
was an Englishman, for this is an English
name and a good family too!'
`Then he ought to have had more money
about him,' said the foot-pad growling. `I
will do better next time!'
`Your way of raising a revenue upon the
sovereign people, isn't so safe as mine,' said
Wild laughing. `You had best give up the
high ways and take to picking locks.'
`That is beneath me,' answered Ruyter.
`If I have been in States' prison, I am at least
a gentleman in blood.'
`Every man to his taste. Now here is
Corney
here, a man I dare say of as good blood
as you are, Ruyter, who has not disdained to
play the clasher on one occasion.'
Here Ruyter directed his gaze inquisitively
towards Herman whose sensations at such a
moment it would be difficult to describe. He
had seen his father only to despise him; and
as he sat before him he internally resolved
that he would never acknowledge him or be
made known to him. As his father kept his
gaze upon him Herman dropped his eyes and
tried to assume an indifference that he was
very far from feeling. He trembled each
instant
lest by some means he should be
recognized
by him. But his father after regarding
him steadily for a few moments looked away
with this remark,
`Your friend is young, Wild, and may do
better by and by than pick locks. If he will
come under my teaching I will made a
gentleman
of him in my way!'
`I dare say he is very much obliged to
you. But by the by, have you found your
wite yet?'
`No,' answered Ruyter with a deep oath.
`I am persuaded she is in the city, for I have
found out that much. But where she conceals
herself, I can't yet find out!'
`What do you want to see her for? You
knew she is nothing to you now! State's
prison divorces!'
`I know that! But I mean to see the
woman
!
I know her well, and that I can
intimidate
her to give me a home and money, too, if
I am short run!'
`What money has she?' carelessly wishing
to get all he could out of his friend.
`None of her own I reckon, for the person
who saw her said she was poor-looking! But
she has the control of my boys's twenty
thousand
,
and it is to get the possession of this
I would see her. This one idea has been
uppermost
in my mind ever since I first entered
Sing-Sing.'
`Ah, yes! you had a son, I now
remember
!'
`Yes; a fine little fellow when I saw him
lasta boy of some six or seven years! And
he is living now if he hasn't been
shipwrecked
;
for I have heard he has grown up a fine
looking man and gone to sea. This money was
given him by his mother after she sold her old
rookery and the land, and it is in trust now
with somebody; but who I can't find out!
Now if I can fall in with her I can get it all
out of her before he returns from sea; and
once in my possession, he may whistle for it!
If he or she are troublesome, I have a settler
here!' And he laid his hand significantly
upon his knife.
Wild looked aside at Herman's face, which
he saw was deadly pale, while his eye was
fearfully black, save a bright, intense star of
indignant light, blazing in the depth of its
centre. He was about to make some remark
to Ruyter, but the expression of Herman's
face checked his words. He saw that he was
about to speak, and he resolved to wait the
result.
`Sir,' said Herman, with fearful calmness,
and bending his eyes upon him, while he
smiled with an appalling aspect, `what would
you give to him who told you where you
could find Madame de Ruyter?'
`What would I give?' cried he eagerly, and
leaning earnestly forward upon the table; I
would give him one hundred dollars, so that
he did it!'
`What security have I, if I give you this
information
,
that you will pay me?'
`My word! Do you doubt it?'
`No. I will take your word. Come with
me and I will take you to her abode!'
`You will! Do you know it?'
`Yes. I have been there this very night and
seen her!'
`You are my man!' cried Ruyter rising up
placing his cap on his head.
`The only condition I require is, that you
go with me unarmed! Leave your weapons
here!'
`A trap!'
`Do you fear? Then I am not bound to
show you!' answered Herman with a smile
of contempt.
`Then I will go without my weapons. I
can trust himcan I?' he asked in an under
tone of Wild.
`Yes, by all means! He is trump!' Then
puzzled at Herman's course, he, in his turn,
asked the latter in an under tone, `what in
the deuce he intended to do with the hoary
old villain?'
`Leave him to me,' answered Herman,
`and keep my secret!'
`I will!'
`Are you ready?' said Herman in a
commanding
tone as he rose and approached the
door, the bar across which he took down with
his own hand.
`Yes, quite. But '
`But what? Why do you hesitate?'
`I'm blamed if I like your looks, and
suspect
a trap. If Wild was not here I should
believe you were an officer?'
`Then I will go without you. Come,
Wilkins
,
we will depart!'
`Nay, then, here goes with you, Mr.
Corney
!'
answered his father, who by no means
relished the singular tone and air of the young
stranger; and, under other circumstances, his
aroused suspicions would have deterred him
from committing himself to his guidance; but
his strong desire to see his former wife, for
whom he had been diligently on the look-out
since he had been out of prison, led him to
overcome his suspicious fears of a plan to
arrest
him, and to accompany the young man on
the expedition before him. He therefore
followed
him to the street, and here Herman,
after saying a few words to Wild, who left
and entered the tap of the Saracen's Head,
took the direction towards his mother's abode,
his father walking by his side with the silent,
watchful air and manner of a man who
expects
each moment to be betrayed.
`Herman has taken a strange way of
acting
,'
said Wild as he entered the tap, after
looking down the street until they
disappeared
;
`he says it is all right, and bids me wait
for him in the little room where the good
dame Dirk is to have his supper ready. Well,
Herman is a devil of a fellow! The old man
has got into a scrape now, I will wager! It
was capital that he should have divulged his
whole plan right before Herman! If he knew
how I cheated him, passing his son off for
Corney
,
he'd put a knife into me! So, I only
pray Herman may keep him safe, whatever
he is going to do with the old rogue!'
When Herman reached the door leading
up the narrow and dark stair-way leading to
his mothers' room, he turned and addressed
his father in these terms.
`The woman you seek lives here. I will
go up first and prepare her for such an
unlooked
for visitor. You say you were once
her husband, and the sudden sight of you
might affect her! Remain you here, while I
go up. But come into the entry and let me
close the door.
Ruyter obeyed though not without
hesitation
;
and when he saw the door shut upon
him he felt a little trepidation; and after he
saw Herman turn the key and place it in his
pocket, he became satisfied that he had been
trapped. He was about to spring upon the
young man and seize him by the throat,
charging
him with treachery, but Herman had
already
ascended the stairs and opened the door
at the top of the flight and entered the room.
`This place looks confoundedly suspicious,
and I don't by any means like this young
fellow's
looks. He eyes me with an evil eye,
and means me no good! But perhaps he is
right in saying the woman lives here, and
means honestly. I will wait and see what
comes of it. I don't like his locking me in
here in this fashion. Let me see if one of
these panels is not loose! I would get out if
I could. Yes, the door is old and one gives
way! The fresh air enters! I'm out of my
trap!' He was about to yield to his fear and
escape, when he heard the sound of a female
voice above stairs, which at once arrested
him!
`Yes, that is madam! The young fellow
is right! I would know that voice in
Patagonia
!'
he exclaimed with satisfaction, and
hurriedly replacing the panel, he eagerly half
ascended the stairway. All was the next
moment
still. He listened with the most intense
attention.
`Mother,' Herman said on entering
suddenly
,
as he did just as she about retiring for
the night, `mother, I have news of a painful
nature to communicate. My father is
pardoned
out of prison!'
`I knew it, Herman, and have trembled
lest he should seek me!' answered his
mother
with alarm visible on her countenance
and taking him by the hand with fear. Maria was
not visible, but a slight motion of the curtain
that concealed the bed, and a look which Mrs.
de Ruyter cast that way showed him that she
had already retired, fatigued with the duties
and events of the day.
`He does seek you! Nayhear me with
firmness. `I have met him, but he knew me
not, knows me not! I was introduced to him
under the name of Corney. Such you must
call me before him, for you will see him in a
few moments!'
`See him! Oh, Herman, Herman, have
you brought your father hither?' she cried,
clasping her hands.
`Yes, mother! I did it from a laid plan. I
heard him say to a friend and to myself,
supposing
me to be Corney, that he sought you to
get my property from you (knowing
me
, as he
said, to be at sea) and to get a home and
asylum
with you by intimidating you. He said
he would give a hundred dollars to any one
to show him where you were. A scheme
entered
my mind suddenly, and I said that I
would show him, for I knew where you lived.
He is now below in the entry! When you
see him meet him carelessly, and firmly, for I
shall be present. Be guided by me in the
progress
of the interview; for this night I mean
to relieve you from all future fears from him.
I have thought it best if he was resolved to
see you, he had best see you once for all in
my presence. Now be calm, and I will bring
hin in! Be firm, dear mother, for I am with
you, and remember!'
Mrs. de Ruyter stood pale and confounded,
with her hands clasped upon her bosom, and
her eyes lifted to Heaven in prayer for
strength. Herman tenderly embraced her,
repeated
his injunctions to be firm, and then
went towards the door.
`Come up, sir, the lady will see you,' said
Herman, opening the door and calling below.
When Ruyter entered and beheld his wife
standing, calm and self-possessed, though
very pale, in the centre of the room, he
remained
a moment gazing upon her without
motion. Her matronly air and lady-like
dignity
,
abashed him, and made him feel the
inferiority
to which crime had degraded
himself
.
Herman advanced a few steps, and stood
not far from his mother, giving her a look of
encouragement. But how could the poor lady
gather encouragement from
such
a source,
against such a danger! How could she
gather
strength from the assurance that the
son
would protect the mother against the father!
Her heart sunk within her; though she strove
to sustain herself, feeling that she had need!
At length the returned convict spoke:
`So,' he said, with a half smile, that on his
features was a leer of the grossest hardihood
of character, `so wife we have met again!'
`I am no longer your wife, sir,' she
answered
firmly.
`That is as we may agree, madam, he
answered
with irony, and advancing a step
nearer to her. `I say young fellow,' he
added
,
turning to Herman, here is the purse I
took, you know when! Take it in part pay
and go. To-morrow I will pay you the
balance
of what I agreed to!' As he spoke he
tossed the purse to Herman. Take it and go
back to the Saracen! I have some little
private
affairs with this lady to talk over!'
`I keep the purse but shall not leave until
I receive the balance,' answered Herman,
placing the purse in his pocket.
`There are thirty dollars in it,' answered
the convict with a savage glance!'
`There should be seventy more. Till I
receive
it I shall not leave you,' answered Her
man with positiveness. `Say what you say
before me if you cannot pay me what you
owe!'
`Then go to the devil for the balance,'
answered Ruyter with a brutal oath. `Listen
if you will, I care not!'
CHAPTER VI.
The Conviction.
When
the convict had thus spoken he
turned to Madame de Ruyter, who, pale and
trembling had listened to their words, and
said to her.
`Madam, I should judge you were not very
glad to see me by your looks, but I am
determined
to make my home here! What has
become of Herman's money?'
`It is all lost!' she answered faintly.
`Lost? I do not believe a word of it! How
lost?'
`The banker who had it in trust failed?'
`'Tis false! who was he?' he cried
advancing
,
and was about to lay his hand upon her;
but Herman's arm intervened and knocked
his upward, while he said to him in a very
positive tone,
`Speak to the lady, and lay not a finger
upon
her!'
`Ah, younker, you are home here it seems!
what is the woman to you! She is my wife,
and I'll thank you to keep yourself at a
distanced
!'
`Who I am, you shall know in good time.
I shall see the lady is not rudely treated.
What you have to say, say to her, for the
hour is late!'
His father fixed on him a glance of rage and
hatred, but seeing the tall well-limbed young
man stand composed and resolute, he feared
the encounter with him, he meditated; and
then he remembered that he was without his
weapons.
`Well, I'll find time and a way to be quits
with you, young fellow,' he said sullenly.
`Now, wife, let us hear about the money you
put in bank for your son!'
`I have told you it was all gone! The
banker has failed and both Herman and I are
impoverished You see my abode. This
should convince you!'
The convict glanced his eyes around the
wretched abode, and then said
`Very well, it may be so, but I doubt it.
Who was this banker?'
`Mr. Waldeigh!'
`Oh, aye! I remember his name. I can
find out the truth of this matter for myself
then to-morrow. Where's Herman?'
`He, he went to sea two years ago,'
answered
his mother catching Herman's cautioning
glance.
`Yes, so I heard! When do you look for
him home?'
`He wrote me he should be here about this
time!'
`Well, I'm glad he will find his money all
gone,' said Ruyter with an oath; `he is a
confounded
high spirited fellow I'm told, and
don't fear the devil! I hope he'll come soon,
for when he finds he's poor he'll take easily to
training for the profession I follow; and I'd
like to have the teaching of the boy. If he's
so smart as I hear he is, he'll cut me all out!
Now, old woman what have you got for
supper
?'
`Nothing!'
`NothingI must have something. I
havn't eaten since my dinner, and that was a
slim affair. You may as well stir for I mean
to sup and lodge here to-night!' As he spoke
he was about to sit down in a chair, when
Herman removing it from behind him cast it
to the farther side of the room, saying at the
same time,
`Now, sir, if you have said all you wish to
this noble and virtuous lady whom you have
so long disgraced by your crimes, it is time
you should take your leave, for be assured
here this night you neither sup nor lodge!'
`Who the devil are you?' asked de Ruyter
after gazing with surprise upon him as he
stood eyeing him with calm and resolute eyes.
`I am the bearer of the name you have
disgraced
and degraded! I am the inheritor of
your infamy. My name is Herman de Ruyter
like thine own!'
`What?' exclaimed the astonished father
starting back and fixing his confounded stare
upon the features of his son. `Are you
Herman
?
Are you my son?' and he trembled
with fear as he put the interrogation to the
indignant
and stern young man.
`To my disgrace I am thy son, man of
crime! In me behold the child for whom it
was your duty to have lived an honorable and
virtuous life! But instead you turned your
red hand to guilt, and brought woe upon your
wife, my mother, and entailed dishonor upon
me! For this I might forgive you, but for
your wrongs to her I love and honor, I curse
you! Vile wretch! not satisfied with the
deep wrongs you have done her, you would
now come crawling like the slimy serpent
from your filthy den of crime, and coiling
yourself upon her threshhold, poison all the
air around you! No!I am here to be her
protector, and,
if need be
, her avenger! To
me you are only a convict of the State's
prison
!
As a father I never knew you or your
love! I have only known my mother.
Therefore beware my vengeance, for no filial
emotion lies between it and thee! That thou
mightest hear me speak, and that I might
know all thy purpose towards my mother, I
brought thee here myself, lest you should
creep hither unawares and do mischief! I
thought it best you should see her in my
presence
.
You have seen her, and in the
interview
betrayed to us both the deep depravity
of your base heart. Now, sir. the interview
is ended! From this moment be a stranger
to this lady! See her house again, dare to
lift a recognising look in the street, dare to
approach her in any way, and I swear to you
by the God that made me, that that hour shall
be your last!'
`Herman, Herman!' cried Mrs. de Ruyter
in the deepest anguish,
`Not one word to me, dear mother,
now
.
Come, sir, take up your cap and leave this
place, and never cross its threshold again! I
shall watch your movements from this time
with a jealous eye. Leave the house,
wretched
and guilty man! Seek your den and
never crawl from it again to meet the eyes of
the wife and son you have so deeply
wronged
!
Thus speaking Herman opened the door.
Abashed, humbled and subdued by fear, the
guilty wretch turned and silently left the
chamber and descended the stairs. He spake
not a word, nor even looked again upon the
face of her who had once been his wife; but
with his cap over his eyes and a shuffling,
crouching air he went out of the room. What
was in his heart will be better known in the
progress of the tale. Herman went before
him to unlock the outer door. His father
passed out into the open air. Neither of them
spoke. Herman locked the door after him and
then rejoined his mother, whom he found
fainting upon the floor, with Maria in her
night-dress bending over her.
In a few minutes their united efforts restor
ed her, and after a while Herman took his
leave promising to breakfast with them in the
morning. On his way up the street, he
reflected
upon the course he had pursued with
reference to his father, and felt satisfied that
he had taken the only one which would
effectually
protect his mother from his persecutions.
This subject was succeeded in his thoughts
by the lovely image of Maria. He thought
he had never seen her so beautiful as when
bending over her mother in her snowy
night-dress
,
her oval face looking sweetly and
gently
forth from her narrow bordered cap. But
there was something in her look and manner
that troubled him. They were kind, frank,
sisterly; yet there was something wanting;
semething in her glance to answer to his own
deep loving one. She met his eye too freely,
too unreservedly, too openly. It was not that
timid, faltering glance which he looked for,
and which he felt she would manifest if she
thought of him with a tenderer love than a
sister's. Herman was troubled as he thought,
and vague surmises began to fill his bosom,
that possibly Maria never thought of him with
the same feelings with which he regarded her.
`Still,' said he impetuously within himself,
`still if she loves not me who else does she
love! Certainly, knowing I am
not
her
brother
,
she would never drive my image from her
breast to replace it by another! Yet I must
confess I tremble lest it should be so!'
At this stage of his reflection he reached
the door of the Saracen Head and entered.
The tap was nearly deserted; but two or three
persons who were strangers drinking
together
at a table near the fire-place. Dirk Dilley
was seated in her bar reading a newspaper.
Her toilet was improved by a coquettish cap
worn upon the back of her head, and by fresh
curls on either check. She looked up on
seeing
Herman enter as if expecting him, and
smiled.
`Ah,' said she with a smile, `so truant you
come back! I was getting jealous of that
pretty girl till I knew who she was! I heard
all about your affair from Wilk'. So you've
found your mother and sister! Well, I am
glad of it, for you can let me have some of
your company now! I was afraid they would
keep you; but Wilk' told me you'd soon be
in. Your supper is all ready in the little back
parlor, and let us go in to the table; for it is
going on to twelve o'clock. It isn't every
body I'd keep up so late for, Herman!'
`You are very good, Mrs. Wildthat is,
Mrs. Dilley!'
`Call me Isabel, as you did at first! Here
is the door through the bar. Betty stay in
the bar till those men have done drinking
what they have, and thou shut up!'
Thus giving her orders, the handsome
young hostess of Saracen's Head preceded
her guest into her tea-room in the rear of
the bar.
`Where is Wilkins?' asked Herman,
looking
round.
`He is coming; for, as he begged hard, I
invited him to supper with us! Wilk' is a
good fellow, keep him under proper
government
.
It's the way I began with him at first,
when he came out of Sing Sing. If I had'nt
been firm as I was, he would have come into
my house and taken the helm!'
`As my father would have done. I have
seen him, but we met and parted as
enemies
!'
`Well you have a great deal to forgive,
Herman, if you forgive him at all,' said Dame
Dilley, placing the hot-water pot upon the
waiter. `Ah, here is Wilk' all in good time,'
she said, as she heard the tap door open. `I
knew his step! But it sounds as if he was in
bad humor!'
The next moment the door into the
tearoom
from the bar opened, and Wild entered.
He smiled slightly, and expressed, in a brief
word or two, his gratification at finding
Herman
there; and throwing aside his hat and
coat, he took a seat by the table at which
Herman had just placed himself. Wild's
countenance
worked dark and gloomy, and he
seemed to find it difficult to enter into the
conversation as the supper progressed.
`What the deuce is the matter, Wilkins?'
asked dame Dilley, after looking at him
steadily.
`Well the truth is, I have met your father,
Herman, and he assures me that your
property
is all gone by the board!'
`So it is. Waldeigh has become
bankrupt
!'
`You take it very coolly!'
`It would seem more coolly than you
yourself
,
Wild!'
`I  that is I feel confounded sorry for
you!' answered Wild, embarrassed; for the
news he had heard from Ruyter had dashed
his hopes to the ground of sharing the twenty
thousand dollars with Dirk Dilley. Her
countenance immediately fell; but she had
full command over its expression.
`Is it true, Herman?' she asked.
`So my mother tells me. I am sorry
rather
on her account, than my own. But I have
a few hundred left.'
`Have you seen this Waldeigh?'
`No! But he is in the city!'
`I dont believe all is lost, Herman! I know
a way by which he can be compelled to
disgorge
;
for this same Waldeigh lives now in
good style in the upper part of Broadway!'
`In what way?'
`I cannot now explain. But if you will
promise to give me one quarter I get out of
him, I will undertake it!'
`I will do it,' answered Herman.
`The matter is then settled,' answered Wild
with a cheerful tone.
By and by Herman left the table, and was
shown to his room by Dame Dilley, who bade
him good night, but less frankly than she
would have done had he been worth the
twenty
thousand dollars she was fishing for. She
closed the door and then returned quickly,
and with an anxious look to the tea-room,
where she had left Wild. On entering it she
closed the door carefully, and sitting down
fixed her eyes upon his face.
`Well, this game is up,' she said gloomily.
`No, Isabel,' answered the burglar-captain.
`I want to hear your plans?'
`And share in the spoils?'
`I do. Mr. Waldeigh, who was the
trustee
of this money failed, it is true. But he
now lives in good style, and must have
money
.
I have no doubt that every dollar of
Herman's
money is safe in his hands!'
`How will you get it, if it is?'
`By my genius,' Bel! I shall go the first
thing to-morrow and sound the premises. I
will have Waldeigh in my power in less than
twenty-four hours. You know I have four
good men I can trust. I shall want the
`Black Hole.'
`Ah, I see your plan. You are like
yourself
again, Wild! The spirits of old times
has come over you! Now I will tell you what
I will do If this Waldeigh has the money
and you get it out of him, I will promise, if
you pay down half of it to me, to marry you!
`If I had half of it, I should choose a wife
where I liked best, Bel! But dont look dark
Let us be friends. I can't let you have half,
as I claim only a quarter of what I may get
Herman must have the balance!'
The widow reflected a few moments, and
then said, as if yielding,
`Well, Wild, as you say. Go to work and
when you have got the money we can talk
about its division! Now to your room, for its
after midnight. To-morrow night let me
know what you have done.
The burglar captain then took his leave
after
taking a glass of brandy, which she
offered
him. She let him out by a door into the
court, for his room was on the same gallery
with that occupied by Napes and Ruyter.
Seeing a light glimmering beneath the door of
their apartment, he knocked and giving his
name to Ruyter was admitted, and the door
closed upon him. In about twenty minutes
he came forth again, having detailed to both
his plan, with reference to Mr. Waldeigh, and
secured their aid; of Ruyter he was sure of
from the first, for he had learned the result of
the meeting between Ruyter and Herman,
from the lips of the former, when he saw him
outside the Saracen's Head on his return from
Madame de Ruyter's, though the convict did
not give him the account until he had first
cursed him for having introduced his son to
him under the name of Corney.
As Wild was taking his departure from their
chamber, after his secret interview with the
two, Ruyter said softly, so that Napes did not
hear,
`Does Herman lodge here to-night?'
`Yes.'
`Is he in bed?'
`Yes.'
`In what room!'
`Ah, do you mean him harm?' asked Wild,
quickly.
`No, by my soul. He is my boy. Only I
wished to know.
`He is in the first room on the lower floor!'
`Thank you! I dont mean
him
harm! good
night.'
Ruyter closed the door and waited till all
was still, and then taking his knife and pistol
up from the table, he wrapped his over-coat
around his shoulders and was going out, when
Napes, who had thrown himself upon the
bed, asked him where he was going so late?'
`A little private expedition of my own!' he
answered with a scowl.
`Well, don't disturb me when you come in!'
said Napes turning over sulkily with his face
against the wall.
The gray-bearded convict closed the door
noiselessly behind him, and descending the
stairs to the court-yard stood a moment to
listen
.
Finding all still he crossed it to the room
which Herman occupied. He came to the door
and looking through the key-hole saw that all
was dark.
He is safe there for to-night at least. Now
for my revenge on
her!
'
He turned quickly away and with a rapid
step proceeded to a sort of court-gate which
opened into a narrow alley. This being
locked
on the inner side he easily opened and
passing
forth into the alley, he was soon in the
street in front of the tavern. He now took his
way with a stealthy air towards the abode of
Madame de Ruyter. As he came to it he
paused beneath the window and listened. All
was still. He placed his hand upon the door
and found it fast.
`I know as good a way,' he said stooping
down and slipping aside the pannel which he
had loosened two hours before on being left
in the entry by Herman Looking carefully
round to see that he was not watched he
pushed
his body through the opening, and
disappeared
within.
CHAPTER VII.
The Consul's Ball.
Leaving
the convict Ruyter to proceed on
his secret midnight expedition, we will now
refer to an event of our story which has
only yet been hinted at in connection with
the little affair of the `Forget-me-not' worn
by Maria in her bosom. The history of that
little flower is the history of a pure and deep
love.
We have said that Maria's extreme beauty
and her propriety in the exposed situation she
had taken in the cigar mart, attracted many
admirers. Some of these were young men of
respectability, who, while they admired her
beauty, greatly respected her virtue and
modesty
.
Yet she manifested to one and all the
same graceful propriety, in no instance
overstepping
the limits of the most perfect
propriety
.
But the maiden's heart was not made of
ice. The bulwark of reserve and
insensibility
which she had from the first thrown around
her, was not strong enough to keep out the
little god Love, who laughs at bars and
barriers. There happened two gentlemen,
an elderly man and a younger one to pass
along Broadway one evening as she was
standing in her place behind the counter.
Maria never looked lovlier than she did that
evening. The light of the gas burner fell
brilliantly upon her face, and softened, while
it enriched its charms. The young man
caught sight of the beautiful girl and
arresting
the progress of the elder gentleman, turned
with him into the shop. With eyes fixed
upon
her in the deepest admiration the young
man, who with his companion were evidently
high-bred English people, asked her for
cigars
.
While with a gracious smile and a
grace that was inimitable she presented to
him the small rose-wood boxes containing the
most fragrant ones, he could not keep his
eyes from her. At length their deep,
passionate
gaze was felt by her and with a blush
of confusion she dropped her eyes to the
ground, and while he remained did not once
direct them towards him.
`My lord, did you notice the extreme
beauty
of that lovely cigar-girl!' asked the young
man with admiration in his tones, as they left
the mart and resumed their walk.
`Yes. She was remarkably lovely; and
somehow her face has awakened in me a
strange interest.'
`Ah, my lord!' cried the young man
coloring
;
`do you confess this much. I myself
was about confessing that I had felt something
of the same myself! We must be rivals!'
`Your interest is widely different from mine
my young friend; I felt a sad and gentle
interest
awakened in my bosom as I gazed on
her. I thought, too, how many temptations so
young a girl must be exposed, and'
`No doubt felt very philosophical and
parental
my lord,' answered the young man
laughing.
The interest which he felt in the lovely
cigar-vender
was not wholly upon one side.
She had met and felt the passionate yet
respectful
ardor of his glance, and it awakened
in her bosom, emotions pleasing yet agitated.
After his departure she did not forget him
with the next customer, but the image of his
fine face, for he was very handsome, and tall
and noble in height and air, lingered in her
thoughts and was carried home to her humble
pillow where it mingled with her dreams.
The first thought she had the next morning
on awaking, was if she should see the noble
young stranger again that day! and a hundred
times her heart bounded as she lifted her
eyes at an entering foot step which she
thought sounded like his. Just at twilight
she saw him slowly pass the door and look in.
Her heart trembled with emotions of hope,
fear and joy. He passed onward and
disappeared
,
and she sighed and felt a pang of
disappointment
.
The next moment she heard a
step and looking up saw the subject of her
thoughts entering the shop. She trembled
like a leaf. She was afraid to look up, and
stood covered with blushes which she tried to
conceal, for she feared he would discover the
interest he had awakened in her heart. She
was alone in the shop. In the same breath
she wished and did not wish the proprietors
were present!
With ease and self-possession he
approached
the glass case behind which she stood and
in a tone that betrayed a feeling stronger than
mere gallantry asked her for cigars. While
she was waiting upon him he continued to
regard
her intently, and with increasing
admiration
.
In a quiet conversational tone, and in
a manner calculated to win her confidence
(for he saw how embarrassed and confused
she was) he began to speak with her. By
degrees
and in the most delicate way he
succeeded
in learning from her something of her
history, that is so far as the poverty of her
mother, as she called Mrs. de Ruyter,
rendered
it necessary for her to take such a place to
aid in her support. He was charmed with the
frank ingeunousness of her replies, and she
with the kind interest he seemed to take in
her.
`I assure you, Miss,' he said to her `that
the interest I have shown in these inquiries is
sincere, and not mere curiosity. I have had
you in my thoughts, nay, if I dared to speak
it, in my heart, ever since I saw you
yesterday
.
I resolved to visit you again and
converse
with you. You are very good to suffer
me to talk with you. Do you live far from
this?'
`But ten minutes walk, sir,' she answered,
dropping her eyes.
`And do you walk alone?'
`Not always, sir!'
`Will you permit me to wait upon you this
evening when you close your shop?'
`Sir, you are very kind! but you will see
the impropriety of my admitting it. I have
only my fair name, which the least breath of
slander will defame! The proprietor usually
accompanies me; and sometimes I run all the
way alone!'
`I will not urge you,' he said pleasantly;
`but I regret that you are compelled by
circumstances
,
to be placed in such a situation.
Will you permit me, as a friend, to take steps
to render your mother's condition better, so
that you can remain altogether with her?'
`Indeed, sir, you are a stranger, though a
kind one. I feel grateful for your proposal,
but I must decline it!'
At this moment some persons came in, and
the young Englishman took his leave. An
hour afterwards, as it was a moonlight night,
Maria left the shop at eight o'clock to
proceed
homeward. She went tripping along
with a rapid step and with a happy heart, for
she was thinking of the young stranger, when
suddenly she found a gentleman walking by
her side, and his hand laid lightly upon her
arm.
`Do not be alarmed!'
She knew the tones of the voice and
restrained
the impulse to fly; yet she trembled,
though not with fear. `I have watched you
that I may see you safely homeward,' said the
foreigner in the gentlest cadence of his voice.
`I thank you, sir, I am very grateful to you,
but I had rather go alone!'
`Then suffer me to walk a little ways
behind
you,' he said respectfully, and dropping
back a step. She felt his consideration for
her feelings, and instinctively yielding to the
generous impulses which this conduct
aroused
in her bosom, she gradually walked slower,
until he was again by her side. She felt a
sweet sense of protection as he walked along
by her, and her heart was filled with joy as
he discoursed to her in the tender accents of
a pure devotion. He accompanied her to the
door, and there took leave of her, pressing
the hand she diffidently yielded to his
friendly
parting clasp.
`You will permit me this pleasure to-mor
row night,' he said as he was leaving her.
She would have said `yes,' if her feelings
had governed; but, influenced by propriety,
she answered faintly, `no.'
`Then I must trust to chance,' he said,
smiling.
When she reached the room and was alone
with her own thoughts, and began to examine
the nature of her feelings towards the
handsome
and respectful young stranger, she
confessed
,
with a sigh of sadness, that he was
very dear to herfar dearer than she had ever
felt Herman to be'
`Yet he is a stranger! Why should I think
of him. I may well sigh with sadness to
think I have let my affections fix upon one
who is evidently so far above me, and whose
further acquaintance it would be wrong to
encourage
!
I only know his name to be
Edward
,
and that he is a native of England, but
a few weeks in this city. I will try to think
no more of him!' Yet the more she resolved
to banish him from her thoughts, the more he
filled them.
The next evening the young stranger called
at the shop for cigars; and although she tried
to be reserved, his kindness and gentleness of
manner rendered her resolutions of no avail.
Taking advantage of a favorable moment he
took from his breast a boquet, composed of a
sprig of myrtle and a forget-me-not, and
placed it in her hand. As he did so he smiled,
bowed and took his leave. An hour
afterwards
when he overtook her going
homeward
and walked by her side, her arm placed
with confidence in his, he was gratified to
see that his light gift was in her bosom.
After accompanying her to the door he
proceeded
towards the Astor House and entering,
ascended to a suite of rooms where he found
the gentleman Maria had first seen him with.
This person was in full ball dress and was
walking up and down the parlor, as if
waiting
for him. He was a noble looking man,
with a decided military air and a
commanding
person. His age was probably fifty five
or six.
Upon a sofa, reading, sat a lady about five
and forty, and retaining in her fine features
traces of great beauty. There was in her
face sufficient likeness to the young man to
mark the near relationship of mother and
son.
`Ah, Edward, you have kept brother long
waiting for you!' she said with a smile,
mingled
with her mild reproof.
`Some more romancing I'll warrant,'
answered
the gentleman, smiling. `I shall have
to leave New York to save you from falling
in love with a pretty shop-tender!'
`I confess to the charge, uncle, of having
been detained by her. The truth is, my good
lord, I fear I shall have to run away from her;
for I was never so taken!'
`You are imprudent, Edward,' said the lady
Lessington. `You will do this young girl, it
she is modest, a great injury and degrade
yourself. I fear from the animated manner
in which you yesterday gave me an account
of your conversations with her and your
boldness in escorting her homeward, that you
have, in truth, suffered your feelings to get
the better of your judgment. This conduct
is so unlike you! Did I not know the
integrity
of your character I should fear that your
regard for her was dictated by the worst
motives
!'
`My dearest mother, I only wish you could
see her, yourself. I know not what it is in
her face that so deeply interests me. I
frankly tell you, that it she were in a suitable
rank in society, I should not hesitate to
confess
that I was deeply in love with her and
seriously address myself to win her as my
wife!'
`Such being your feelings, my son, it is due
to her as well as yourself that you do not see
her again.'
`I will not promise, my dear mother.'
`Then we had best pursue our tour to
Niagara
and Montreal, brother,' she said turning
to the gentleman who stood by in silence.
`Yes, if Edward has so far forgotten
himself
and what is due to the honor of his rank
and name.'
`Nay, my lord and noble uncle, you are
severe
.
I will make the promise to my mother;
for I feel that it would be criminal and cruel
in me to awaken feellngs in that young girls'
bosom, which could only fall back again upon
her own heart to perish! My mother is right.
I will see her no more; for as an honorable
man I cannot. But this decision will be a
great sacrifice to me; for you know not how
deeply my heart is interested in her, mother.'
`Come, nephew, shall we go to this party.
The carriage has been some time in waiting.
I feared by your delay you had been attacked
by some foot-pad, as I was early this evening.
I gave him my purse to have time to knock
him down, but the rogue got to his feet and
escaped with it.'
`I will complete my toilet in a few
moments
,'
answered the young man. `I trust
you were not hurt.'
`No.'
`I regret, mother, that your slight
indisposition
prevents you from going to this party,'
added lord Edward; and he then left the
room.
After an absence of a few moments, he
returned
and announced himself as ready to
accompany
his uncle.
This party in the drawing-room consisted
of General Lord Delorme, his windowed sister,
the lady Ann Lessington, and her son lord
Edward Lessington. They had arrived three
weeks before in the United States, by the
way of Boston, and had been in New-York
ten days. Their object in visiting America
was partly a tour of pleasure and partly for
lady Lessington to visit her sister, who was
the wife of the Governor General of the
Canadas
.
The ball to which they were invited
was given expressly to them by the British
Consul.
Without describing the magnificence of the
rooms, the elegance of the entertainment, and
the splendor of the gay throngs there
assembled
,
we will pass to an event of the evening,
more intimately connected with our story.
As General Delorme was walking up and
down one of the apartments, conversing with
a distinguished New York merchant, who had
been presented to him, a gentleman entered,
and seeing the former, stood for some
moments
transfixed, closely regarding his face
with a look of the deepest surprise.
At length he walked rapidly up to the
English
consul, and said to him in a tone of
singular
agitation,
`Sir, will you be so kind as to tell me who
that gentleman is, with the high, bold fore
head and military air!'
`That, Mr. Carrol, is General Lord
Delorme
,
whom I told you, you would meet at
my house. Come, and let me present you.
Yonder is his nephew waltzing with Miss
the belle!' But why are you so
agitated
?'
`I beg pardon, sir, for my confusion. But
do you not remember, sir, that seven years
ago I came to you with the account of the
mysterious disappearance of a lovely child,
which I told you I had received from a poor
dying woman, on the passage from England?'
`I remember it perfectly; and that it was
your impression this child belonged to a good
family.'
`Yes, sir. At the same time, I told you
that I had a portrait of a gentleman, copied
from a miniature which the child had with
her, and also the child's portrait taken, and
both sent to England, and placed in a public
gallery there, if perchance the friends of the
child, might by this means be discovered!
Since then, sir, and the sudden disappearance
of the child from my house, I heard nothing
from her! But now sir that gentleman!'
`And what connection has he with the
subject
,
sir?' asked the Consul, with surprise.
`The moment I saw his face as I entered, I
recognized in it the
original
of the miniature
which the child had round her neck, and
which I had copied!'
`Is not this a delusion, Mr. Carrol?'
`No, sir. Each moment I see it stronger
and stronger as well as in his features as when
he smiles a vivid resemblance to the child!'
`This is very extraordinary.'
`It is, sir!'
`Yet, I should not wish to speak of this
subject to General Delorme without stronger
proofs.'
`I will go for the miniature. My carriage
is at the door!'
`Do so, Mr. Carrol. The whole story of
this child as you once related it to me, when
you solicited my aid in your efforts to trace
her parentage, now recurs to me. I am
deeply
interested in the subject. It may be as you
say. Hasten for the miniature, I beg of you!'
In less than twenty minutes Mr. Carrol
returned
and placed the portrait in the Consul's
hands. He had no sooner glanced at it than
he uttered an exclamation of surprise and
astonishment
.
`You are right, sir. It is his portrait, only
some dozen years junior. But to make sure
come with me where lord Edward, his
nephew
,
is standing.
`My lord, here is a miniature. Have you
ever known the original?'
`It is the General's!' he answered, taking
it and glancing at it!'
`Do you mean General Delorme?'
`Certainly, sir. I was not aware you had
it. It looks a little younger, but the likeness
is perfect!'
`I am satisfied, Mr. Carrol,' answered the
Consul. `Come with me and I will also send
for the Earl Delorme to my library. We will
then investigate this interesting affair. But,
alas! if it should prove true that child was
his, what avails to confirm to him her
loss!
!
`It may be that she lives, sir,' said Mr.
Carrol warmly. `I have never ceased to
believe
that she is still alive somewhere; and I
have not for one day given up the hope of
seeing her. I do not encounter in the streets
a young girl of the age she would be now,
that I do not intuitively survey her features
closely and ask myself if it may not be my
lost protege.
CHAPTER VIII.
The Miniature.
When
the message from the Consul came
to lord Delorme, he was at the moment in
conversation
with lord Edward, who was in the
act of asking him where he had had the
miniature
taken which had been shown him by
the Consul.
`I know of no miniature, Edward,'
answered
the nobleman. `What have you seen?'
Before Lord Edward replied, the message
was delivered by an attendant from the
Consul
,
desiring Lord Delorme's presence in the
library.
`Come, Lord Edward, let us go in together
and ask the Consul about this miniature you
speak of!'
Together they entered the library. The
consul met them in the door.
`Pardon me, my lord, for taking this
liberty
;
but I have a few words to say to you in
private.'
`Then I will retire,' answered the young
man.
`No my lord, remain, if you please. You
can hear all I have to say. Be seated!'
Lord Delorme having taken a chair, the
Consul thus addressed him, while Mr. Carrol
sat regarding the features of the nobleman
with the most intense interest, comparing
them from time to time with those of the
miniature
he held in his band.
`My lord,' said the Consul, `I have taken
the liberty of sending for you to ask you if
ever you had a miniature of yourself taken?'
`This singular question would surprise me,
I must confess, sir,' answered Lord Delorme,
but that I was just spoken to about a
miniature
of myself by my nephew. What is this
picture you both speak of?'
Will you be so kind, first, my lord, to
recollect if you ever had a miniature taken?'
`Yes, several.'
`In lockets?'
`No, but one.'
`Is that it, my lord?' cried Mr. Carrol,
extending
that he held in his hand towards
him.
`This, my lord, is Mr. Carrol, an eminent
merchant of this city,' said the consul. `He
will explain to you how he came by the
picture
.'
Lord Delorme took the picture in hand, and
had no sooner glanced at the face than an ex
pression of recognition, mingled with the most
intense surprise, came upon his countenance.
He stared for full one minute, fixedly
regarding
the portrait, and then raising his eyes,
while his face was the color of marble.
`Praypray, sir,` he said in a voice
tremulous
with emotion, and looking towards Mr.
Carroll, `can you tell me where you obtained
this?' and his hand shook like an aspen leaf
as he held it out, with the miniature in it,
towards
Mr. Carrol. `The last time I saw this
miniature I placed it around my child's neck,
since which fatal hour I have never beheld
either! But quickly tell me, sir! He who
can explain how he came by this, must know
something of my lost child!'
His words were full of the pathos of deep
grief. The Consul and Mr. Carrol exchanged
glances of gratified intelligence, both being
satisfied that now, at last, the parentage of
the lovely child was discovered.
`Will your lordship be so good as to state
in what manner and under what
circumstances
you last beheld this miniature?' asked Mr.
Carrol.
`I was returning from London in my
carriage
,
with my little daughter and her nurse,
having taken her to town in the morning, to
indulge her with a holiday. We left London
about an hour before sun-set, I intending to
reach home in time to dine at seven, as my
villa was but sixteen miles from town. The
nurse and child sat on the front seat, and I
upon the back; and as I had had this very
miniature finished that day, and was taking
it home to Lady Delorme, to please the child
I took it from its case, and threw it around
her neck to amuse her while I took a nap, as
was my custom in riding to and from town.
The next thing I recollect was being awakened
by a cold draught in the carriage, when I saw
that one of the doors was open, and that I was
alone!
It was just dark, nay, nearly dark!
Filled with alarm and surprise, I pulled the
string of the carriage to stop it and spring to
the ground. Where is the nurse and my child?
I demanded of the coachman in accents of
horror. No one knew. The postman had
seen nothingheard nothing! Yet by some
means they were both gone, and the door of
the coach I had found open. But without
entering
into the details of my grief and
consternation
,
and giving you an account of my
fruitless search and enquiries, I will briefly
add, that ten days afterwards the nurse made
her appearance at the villa, where all was
mourning, in a state bordering on insanity.
She confessed that while I slept she also fell
asleep, leaving the child standing against the
glass window of the coach, looking out!
That she was awakened by missing the child,
when she found the door open and her charge
gone. She said that the fastening must have
slipped, and that it had fallen out of the
carriage
into the road. Instantly overwhelmed
with a sense of her responsibility, she sprung
from the carriage without giving the alarm,
hoping to find it unhurt, and with the resolve
if it was killed, to take her own life. She
represented
that after searching up and down
the moors all night (for it was while crossing
them she missed the child) she sunk
exhausted
by the way-side. She was taken up by
some humane persons and carried into an
Inn, where she was ill several days with
brain fever; and as soon as she could move
she desired them to take her to me, that she
might know if the child was found, and if not
to confess her own guilt. From that time I
have not been able to trace any clue to my
daughter. I advertised her in all the papers,
offering large rewards even for the least
information
respecting her either alive or dead;
for even the knowledge of her death would
have been a relief far preferable to the
dreadful
state of uncertainty under which we
labored
.
At length, after a year had elapsed, we
gave her up as dead, though not without a
lingering hope, she might yet live and be
restored
to us. And now when I inform you,
gentlemen, that this miniature is the very one
which I placed around her neck the last time
I looked upon her, you will not be surprised
at the emotion which you have seen me
manifest
on beholding it under circumstances so
extraordinary! Sir, if you regard a father's
feelings, make haste to give me such
information
as you possess in relation to this
picture
!'
`My lord,' answered Mr. Carrol with deep
sympathy in his tones, `Seven years ago the
past season, I came passenger from England
to this port, in a ship which also carried as a
steerage passenger, a poor but respectable
looking woman, who had with her a young
girl of nine or ten years of age. This woman
died on the passage and committed the child
to my charge. She said that it was not her
own; but that she had found it one evening
wandering on the moss near London, when it
was about five years old.'
`
My
child! This was the eye of my lovely
Maria when I lost her,' exclaimed Lord
Delorme
,
deeply interested in this narration.
`The woman said she took the child home,
and her heart yearned toward it because she
had a few days before buried her own little
girl about the same age. She said the child
was richly dressed and had not only the
minature you now hold about its neck, but
also a small cross. She gave me the
miniature
in her dying hands, saying she had
repented
keeping the child, and hoped that it
would be the means of returning her to her
friends. She said she had not heard any
inquiries
after it, which is probable from her
obscure situation; and as she removed to
another neighborhood and pawned it off for
her own little girl suspicion never fastened
upon her.'
`That child, gentleman, must be my
daughter
,'
answered Lord Delorme with the most
profound emotion.
`There can be no question of it,' exclaimed
earnestly Lord Edward. `How
extraordinary
!'
`I fear from the sad expression upon your
face, Mr. Carrol,' said Lord Delorme, `that
the child entrusted to you, no longer lives,
and that I have found my daughter only to
weep over her grave.'
`I wish, my lord, I could relieve your
anxiety
as well as my own touching the fate of
this sweet child.'
`Then my foreboding's are true.
`You shall hear, my lord! I accepted the
trust the dying woman confided to me, and
took the lovely child to my own house and
adopted her as my daughter.'
`Thanks, thanks, kind sir.'
`I, at the same time, had a portrait taken
from this miniature and sent to the
gallery
in London, in hopes some one, knowing
the original, might see it and so lead to the
discovery of her parentage; for, much as the
lovely little girl became endeared to us, I felt
it my duty to leave no means untried to
discover
her family.'
`Sir, you now have a father's warmest
gratitude
,'
said Lord Delorme.
`I have also, my lord, the approval of my
own heart. We soon learned to love the
child as our own, and each day she wound
herself more and more closely around our
hearts. I also had a portrait of the child
taken with the intention of sending it to
London
,
when'
`A portrait of my child,' exclaimed Lord
Delorme with intense excitement. `Where
is it? Let me behold it! The sight of it would
at once assure me of the identity of this
protege
of yours with my daughter, if they are
one and the same, of which I have no doubt!
Where have you this portrait, Mr. Carrol?'
`It will be here in a moment, my lord,'
answered
Mr. Carrol. `After getting back here
with the miniature, I recollected the portrait
and despatched a servant for it, thinking it
would serve to strengthen the testimony I
foresaw from your resemblance to the
miniature
,
was about to be brought to bear upon my
protege's parentage.'
While Mr. Carrol spoke a knock was heard
at the door and on opening it he saw the man
with the portrait. He took it from him and
placing it in a strong light over against the
lamp, stepped aside for lord Delorme to look
at it. The nobleman and his nephew both
eagerly approached to view it and both at the
moment exclaimed,
`It is she!'
`It is my daughter, my long lost child again
before me!' continued Lord Delorme,
kneeling
upon one knee before the picture and
gazing upon it with wrapt affection. `Yes,
the same delicate brow! the same sweet
smile and mouth! the same soft brown hair!
Only it is my Maria with more maturity; the
maturity that six years would give! In her
fifth year she was lost to me, and this was
taken you say six years afterwards, Mr.
Carrol
!'
`She was probably eleven when this was
painted, my lord!'
`So
she
would have looked at eleven!'
`It looks almost as she looked at five,
uncle
,'
said Lord Edward, gazing upon it with
surprise and tenderness. `There can now be
no manner of doubt as to the identity of the
original of this portrait!'
`There is even a correct representative of
the very cross she woreher mother's gift,'
resumed the nobleman, still kneeling before
the picture and regarding its features with
the deepest attention and an air of grief
mingled
with tenderness. The young man also
began to fix his eyes upon it with suddenly
renewed animation, as if he had all at once
discovered in it some half-remembered
resemblance
of some one. The longer he gazed the
stronger this impression grew upon him that
he had not only seen the original of that
picture
before him years past, in childhood, but
he had seen the same face recently. But
where he could not decide! Still he
surveyed
it, more and more puzzled, for the longer
he looked the deeper grew this impression.
`Now, Mr. Carrol, all that remains is for you
to inform me of the fate of my child,' said
Lord Delorme, rising and turning sadly
towards
him. `I am persuaded she is no more;
therefore tell me when she died and where you
have laid her!'
`There seems destined, my lord, that all
connected with his lovely child should be
attended
with mystery. A few weeks after I
had had this picture taken, my house was
broken into by night, by a notorious burglar,
who was, however, arrested. But by some
stratagem he escaped and the next night the
house was also entered, but whether by the
same or not I cannot tell. The alarm was
given by a servant, and as I was rushing from
my room I heard the wild cries of Maria from
the rear of the house. Appalled at the sound,
for I supposed she was fast asleep in her little
bed, I flew down stairs, her cries ringing in
my ears
`Save me, father, Oh, save me!'
`Would to God I, her father, had been
there to answer her cries! Go on sir,' said
the nobleman with deep excitement.
`I reached the gate and leaping into the
lane saw a carriage at the other end just
driving
off at a furious rate. I suspected that
Maria had been borne away in it and giving
the alarm I started in swift pursuit. But it
was out of sight when I got to the head of the
lane and I saw it no more. Three days
afterwards
the body of the burglar Shears, who
had broken into my house was found floating
in a dock in East River, with a deep knife
wound in his breast. All search after Maria
proved fruitless and at length I gave her up
as dead!'
`And from that moment you have not seen
nor heard from the hapless girl?' asked lord
Edward.
`No, my lord. It is my belief she horribly
perished in some way connected with the
burglar's death; for I cannot but believe that
he was the person who abducted her; for he
escaped the day after he was taken in my
house, and doubtless came the next night and
carried off the child out of revenge!'
`It is doubtless so. But how he should
come to a sudden death and no traces of the
child is extraordinary,' said Lord Edward.
Was there any suspicion how this notorious
burglar got his death wound.'
`No, my lord. It was doubtless in some
broil among his associates who threw his body
into the river to conceal the act!'
`But my child
my child
. What became
of my child?' cried the nobleman in the
deepest
anguish.
`Was there no child's body found near that
time?' asked Lord Edward.
`None. I made every inquiry but without
being able to get hold of the least clue to
unravel
the mystery that hung around her
sudden
disappearance from beneath my roof!'
`Mr. Carrol,' said Lord Delorme in a tone
at once solemn and despondingly, `do you
have the least hope that my child lives?'
`I have never, my lord, given up the hope
of once more seeing or hearing from her. It
is my opinion she lives, though perhaps dead
to us who are so deeply interested in the
knowledge of the fact!'
`Oh that I could believe that I should once
more behold her! But no! There is not the
least probability! She is no more! Alas!
that I should have discovered thus much!
that I should have dispelled one painful
mystery
hanging about her first disappearance, to
be plunged into the mazes of another still
more distressing! Is there
no
clue by which
we might sift this matter to the bottom?'
`I would recommend, my lord,' replied the
Consul `that an advertisement be inserted in
the principal papers of the city, referring to
the events narrated by Mr. Carrol, and
offering
a large reward for any information that
may throw light upon her present condition.'
`It shall be done. Edward you will write
such an advertisement, and be so good as to
have it in the paper to-morrow. My child
may yet live, and I may yet embrace her!
By this time she would be seventeen! Alas!
if living, into what fearful moral degradation
may she not have been plunged.
Nevertheless
,
she would be still my child!'
The parties so deeply interested in the fate
of the lovely wanderer after some further
discussion
upon the subject, retired from the
library
.
Lord Delorme called his carriage and
sought his rooms at the Astor, where he had
related all he had heard to his sister, lady
Lessington, who listened with surprise, that
cannot be described but may be imagined.
It was her opinion, after Maria's first
preservation
so wonderfully, that she was destined
again to re-appear; and that both would yet
behold her. She was all hope and joy, and
communicated new energies to the depending
spirits of lord Delorme.
Edward was not disposed to retire so early
from the ball, and lingered till twelve, when
he left, and wrapped in his cloak, pursued his
way alone, thinking upon the extraordinary
revelations he had heard. As he came near
the lane which turned down to the abode of
the lovely cigar-vender, he was inspired by a
idesire to pass her window and recall her sweet
mage, quite forgetting his promise made to
his mother. As he came near, he saw a man
looking by the door in a suspicious manner,
and he paused in the shade, the closer to
observe
his operations.
CHAPTER IX.
The Assassin.
The
person whom the young nobleman
discovered was Ruyter, the convict. Edward
watched him closely, for he well knew the
character of the neighborhood in which the
beautiful cigar-girl lived, and he had spoken
to her about the danger of dwelling in such a
quarter of the city, delieately offering to her
at the same time such means as would enable
her to choose a better abode. This offer,
however
,
the young girl gratefully declined,
acting
in this instance as in all other cases with
that charming propriety which characterized
her.
`If the house were not so wretched I should
suspect this fellow of burglary. But he must
have some other motive than treasure. Nay!
what treasure is more valuable than the
lovely
cigar-vender who dwells there! She must
be the object and I am providentially here!'
While he was making these mental
observations
,
Ruyter had slipped the pannel as we
have seen, and to the surprise of Edward
darted
through it and disappeared. He
immediately
approached the door and softly sliding
the pannel back again (for the convict had
replaced
it) he endeavored to pass through; but
being stouter about the shoulders than Ruyter
he was unable to get in as he had done. He,
however, by passing his arm through the
aperture
succeeded in reaching up to the key on
the inside and unlocking the door.
As it opened he entered and listened. A
door closed softly above him. He groped his
way up the stairs and entered the room into
which Ruyter had already preceeded him.
As he went in the convict had sprung a dark
lantern and as Edward entered he saw him
advancing towards a bed the lantern in one
hand and a gleaming blade in the other.
Intent
on his murderous purpose Ruyter was
not conscious that his steps were followed, for
he believed that the door below was firmly
secured
.
Edward saw that the man's purpose
was murder, and with noiseless advance drew
near and stood over him ready to arrest his
hand. The curtain of the bed was partly
drawn aside and Ruyter saw lying asleep in
it the victim of his vengeance and also, to his
surprise, the beautiful face of a young girl.
This discovery seemed to startle him and
lowering
his knife he gazed upon her with
wonder
.
He feared also to do the murder he had
contemplated; and stood deliberating. The
young nobleman also saw the lovely sleeper
by the light of the convict's lantern and he
let his eye dwell upon the sweet features with
deep admiration. All at once Ruyter placed
his knife and lantern upon the floor, and
taking
a cravat from his neck, muttered.
`This shall do it! The thing can be done
quietly by passing this round her throat, and
the girl not be waked!'
He twisted the handkerchief hard into a
rope, and was bending over the unconscious
sleeper, when Edward with a quick
movement
over the head of the assassin, seized both
ends of this twisted cravat, wrested it from
his grasp and with the rapidity of lightning
took a double turn with it round his neck;
then drawing the ends together with a strong
hand, he threw the astonished and alarmed
convict backwards upon the floor, and placed
his foot upon his breast.
`Lie there villain!' he cried sternly, `and
offer to move a muscle and with your own
knife I will strike you to the heart!'
Alarmed by the fall Madame de Ruyter and
Maria both awoke in terror. Their
consternation
on seeing a man standing in the
middle
of the chamber with his foot upon the
body of another nearly paralyzed them.
Neither could give utterance to the cry that
rose to their lips. A second glance told
Maria
that one of them was the handsome
stranger
;
and deep blushes instantly chased away
the paleness of fear, while instinctively she
drew the curtain towards her to hide herself;
yet filled with wonder and fear!
`Do not be alarmed,' said the young man
in tones that at once inspired confidence in the
breast of Madame de Ruyter, for Maria's
fears were already vanishing at the sight of
one whom she was at the moment she awaked
pleasantly dreaming, `this man I saw
breaking
into your house and following him into
this room prevented him from doing murder.
But for my providential interference in
arresting
his hand you madam would have been the
victim.'
Both of the ladies shrieked, and Madame
de Ruyter trembled with horror, as she
recognized
the dark features of her late husband!
`It is well for you, Madam, growled the as
sassin, that this chap happened to be at hand;
for I had sworn to take your life. That young
girl, who, I suppose is one of your brats, I
would then have taken into my possession.
Come, friend your foot is rather heavy on my
breast bone, and I dont like this cravat being
quite so tight!'
`Get to your feet, fellow, but I shall retain
my grasp upon this handkerchief. Now come
with me. When I am gone ladies, you can
secure the doors, and doubtless will meet no
further interruption to-night. I did not speak
to you, fair Maria without cause, for
dwelling
in such a neighborhood!'
`To-morrow we leave it, sir, for a better
house,' answered Madame de Ruyter.
`You should do so. Good night, Madame,
and rest secure, for I will place a watchman in
charge of the premises for the remainder of
the night. Good night, my friend!' he added
looking towards the blushing girl. `Now
fellow
,
come with me! The least attempt on
your part to escape, will make your knife
point, and heart's blood acquainted!'
The young nobleman then led him out of
the chamber by a grasp upon the cravat, and
holding Ruyter's own knife in his other hand
above his breast. The convict suffered
himself
to be led in this way in dogged silence to
the street, where Edward gave him into the
hands of two watchmen, who, hearing the
noise had hastened to the scene, and telling
them the nature of his offence, told them to
guard him with unwonted vigilence.
Madame
de Ruyter from her window saw this
transfer to the custody of the watchmen, and
felt relieved.
`He is now in security, Maria, and I need
no longer tremble! I feared that he would
seek my life! How providential my escape.
Who could this brave young gentleman be?
He called you by name! You must know him,
dear!'
`He is the one who gave me the
forget-me-not
,
my dear mother,' answered the loving
girl with grateful joy. `I tell you that now
because I feel, after what he has done, you
will not censure me for loving him!'
`No never, my sweet child! But do you
love him?'
`With all my heart, and now more than
ever!' she answered with fervent emotion.
`And this is why you cannot love my poor
boy, who idolizes you! Well, dear child, I
canot help it now, only I pity Herman! Who
is this young man?'
`Indeed, dear mother, I have never asked
his name. I only know that he calls himself
Edward!'
`Well, dear, I hope good will come of it.
He has certainly shewn himself a brave man,
and looks like a perfect gentleman. I hope
good will come of it! But then was it not
strange he should have been about here at this
time of the night!'
`I do not know, mother,' answered Maria,'
but feeling she could very truly guess.
There was some further conversation,
during which Madame de Ruyter convinced
herself that Herman had no place in the heart
of her lovely protege, and that he was rather
feared than loved. She sighed for him,
knowing
well the violence of his character, and
how fearfully the knowledge of this fact
would affect him.
CHAPTER X.
The Advertisement.
It
was about nine o'clock the morning
following
that Wilkins Wild was seated at a
table in the tap-room of the Saracen's head,
taking a cup of coffee and reading the
morning's
paper which had just been thrown into
the door by a news-boy. Plymp and Napes
sat on the opposite side of the table smoking
cigars.
`What news, Captain?' asked the former,
lighting a fresh cigar.
`I dont see any thing.' Ahyes I do,
though! Here is your chum in a fix Napes!'
`WhatRuyter?'
Yes! Here he is in the Police report!'
`I'm glad of it.' answered both burglars,
venting their satisfaction in deep oaths.
`What has he done? added Napes. `He
went out after you left ns, and I saw no more
of him! Has he killed any body?'
`Here is the account. I will read it,'
answered
Wild, throwing himself back in his
chair with his feet laid across the corner of
the table:
`A villanous looking fellow by the name of
Ruyter, known as `sharp knife' among his
fellows, was brought up for an attempt at
murder. He was detected by a gentleman
breaking into a house in  street, where
but for him he would have murdered a female
in bed. This person arrested him in the very
act of taking her life, and delivered him into
the custody of the watchmen. This Ruyter
was recently pardoned out of State's prison,
where he was sentenced for life fourteen years
ago, for a highway robbery and murder. The
woman he attempted to murder was his wife
before his incarceration. He was fully
cemmitted
for trial, the gentleman, who arrested
him, and whom we learn is Lord Edward
Lessington, at present sojourning here,
appearing
against him, as well as Madame de
Ruyter, whom the Justice, at his lordship's
request
,
sent for.'
`Then Ruyt' is fixed comfortably for the
rest of his life,' said Plymp. `I never liked
the man. He was too fond of blood.'
`Yes, we are peaceable pick-locks and do no
mans any injury,' answered Napes with an
air of self satisfaction.
`Very innocent gentlemen we are all, no
doubt,' remarked Wild dryly. `So this
villain
has tried to kill his poor wife. It is well
Herman was not the one who arrested him,
for he would have taken his life, father or no
father on the spot. Where is Herman, daine?'
asked Wild laying down the paper and
turning
his head towards the bar.
`He went out early this morning. But
come here, Wilk', I have a word to say.'
`Well, wife, what is it?' he asked
approaching
her and leaning over the bar towards her.
`Have you been sounding Waldeigh's
premises?'
`Yes. I was there by sun-rise. I went as
a brick-layer sent by the landlord to examine
the flues! I went all through the house. It
was richly furnlshed and I am confident old
Waldeigh had Herman's money to do it with!
I have all my plans arranged for having him
your guest to night, dame, provided we can't
bring him to terms in his own house. He has
but two servants besides a foot-boy, and only
himself and sister. Napes and Plymp are to
be my aids.'
`Well they will do if they can keep sober.'
`They have both promised me to drink
nothing stronger than coffee to day.'
`What hour have you fixed upon?'
`Eight o'clock.'
`Ho, captain,' called out Napes from the
table and holding the newspaper in his hand.
`Here is a windfull for some luckly fellow
if
he gets.'
`What is it?' carelessly inquired Wild as he
returned to his seat and resumed the position
of his feet across the table.
`A bouncing reward offered!'
`How much?'
`One thousand dollars!'
`One thousand?' repeated Wild. `Let me
see the paper!'
The burglar surrendered it and Wild then
read aloud
ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD!
The above reward will be paid to any
person
who will communicate any information
concerning a little girl of ten years old who
mysteriously disappeared from the dwelling
of Mr. Carrol, Washington square, seven
years ago this month. This child if living
must be now seventeen years of age, with
blue eyes, fair brown hair and a delicate
complexion
.
The above reward will be paid for
such information as may lead to a knowledge
of her fate whether she be now living or dead!
Apply to Parlor No. , Astor House!'
When the burglar Captain had finished
reading this advertisement, he compressed his
lips and let his clenched hand fall with an
emphasis
upon the table till the wares upon it
rung again.
`What? Do you know any thing about
this, Captain?' asked Napes, eagerly.
`I'll wager an X he does!' responped
Plymp.
`Not I. I know nothing,' he answered
evasively. `I was only thinking what a
capital hawl that would be
if
I
did
know!'
In a moment or two afterwards Wild got
up and in a lounging manner wholly
calculated
to lull suspicion that this movement was
owing to the advertisement, he went out of the
tap. On gaining the street he walked rapidly
in the direction of Madam de Ruyter's
dwelling
.
As he went he thus gave utterance to
his thoughts.
`I have it now! It is as clear as day-light!
That very girl Herman called his sister is the
the original of the portrait I saw at Mr.
Carroll's
.
That is why I have been so troubled
with her face from the moment I saw her in
the tap. I had recognised its resemblance to
that portraitthat portrait which I recollect
that boy, as he was, fell in love with from my
description. There is no mistake. This young
girl is just the age, too, that this child would
be now. There is no doubt that Herman stole
her off, and  ah! a new light breaks upon
me. This girl was said at the time to have
been seen to be taken into the carriage by a
man while a lad sprung up behind. This
then will give me a clue to the mystery that
hangs around Shear's path; for I well knew
Shears took off this young girl. The death
of Shears, the disappearance of the girl and
Herman, also, all at the same time, link the
three events together; and now I know that
this
sister
of Herman is neither more nor less
than the young girl that Shears carried off.
How Herman mixed himself with the affair I
cant tell; but one thing is certain, his mother
has the girl beneath her own roof. I will see
him and have a talk with him! If what I
suspect about Shears is true, Herman is in
my
power
. Here is the house!
He ascended the stairs and knocked at the
upper door. It was opened by Herman. He
was in a state of great excitement, for his
mother
,
who had just returned from the Police
court, where she had entered her complaint
against her late husband, was relating the
whole affair to him. Herman had been in but
a little while, early as he had risen; for he
had met Maria at the street door as she was
going to her new rooms in Nassau street, to
get them all ready to move into. On the way
he poured out all his heart before her. On
reaching the rooms she desired him to be
seated, and calmly listen to her while she
spoke with him. She then in a gentle way,
and with a sweet dignity becoming a maiden
at such a crisis, told him that her regard for
him was only sisterly, and that as a sister
she loved him with great affection.
`More than this, Herman,' she said with a
voice slightly tremulous, `I can never be to
you!'
We will not attempt to portray the scenes
of wild passiontears, pleadings,
recriminations
,
and fearful wrath which this confession
produced. During all he did not ask her if
she loved another, nor did she make this
confession
;
for she feared for the life of him she
loved.
`Well, be it so! he said bitterly, after
pouring out, not upon her, but upon himself,
the bitterest denunciations for loving as he
had done, and deceiving his heart. `Be it so,
Maria! From this time I am a reckless man
a man of blood! You know what my early
career was, and that I turned from it that I
might be worthy of your pure love. I sought
honors and a good name, that I might lay
them at your feet! I shunned temptation for
your sake! I kept your image upon the altar
of my heart and daily worshipped it there.
Each day by your power in me and over me,
I grew better. I looked forward to happiness
only in your presence. Butwhywhy
do I recapitulate these things! Why do I
open my mouth! You are lost to me forever!
Cruel, ungrateful! But I will not curse you!
I love you, and I refrain from speaking the
words of bitterness that rush from my
crushed
heart to my burning lips. Sister's love?
NayI want no love but that love which
answers
to mine! I am sorry, MariaI am sad
and sorrowfulfor I know that from this hour
I have neither helm, nor chart, nor
compass
!'
As he thus gave utterance to his emotion he
hastily left her, and rushed into the street.
He sought his mother and poured the tale of
grief into her sympathising ear. From her
he first learned that she loved
another
! Who
it was he, also, learned from her; and when
he was told it was he who had saved his
mother's life, he buried his face in his hands
and wept passionately; for he felt that he
could not injure the life of the noble youth
who had saved his mother's!' It was during
this painful interview that Wild knocked at
the door.
`Well!' said Herman, almost savagely.
`Do you come for me to do crimes! If so, I
am ready!' and he laughed so wildly that the
burglar captain believed for a moment that he
was insane.
`No, Herman, I have not come to get you
to engage in any new affair; but to see you
about an old one!'
`Well what is it?'
`Can your mother leave the room a
moment
?'
`Go mother! Now we are alone! What
would you with me?' he asked gloomily.
`I have long wanted to ask you, Herman,
about the death of Shears!' and the burglar
eyed him closely. `There have some
circumstance
lately come to light that lead me to
believe
,
who was the author of it?'
Herman colored deeply, and then became
suddenly pale. This emotion confirmed, Wild
in his belief.
`Who do you suspect?' asked Herman.
`
You
!' answered Wild firmly.
`
Me?
' answered Herman starting from his
chair.
`Yes, and you may as well confess it. But
read
that
! and you will see I know something
more!' and he placed the newspaper he had
brought with him, in his hand. He watched
his countenance while he read it. Herman's
hand which held the newspaper trembled
like a leaf as he finished the perusal. He
looked up at Wild, with a look of alarm and
suspicion.
`Well, what is this to me?' he asked
hoarsely.
`That you are not only in some way
concerned
in the death of Shears, but that the
young girl here described, is the very same I
saw you protect from Napes and Plymp in
the tap! I recognized her by the portrait I saw
at Mr. Carrol's!'
CHAPTER XI.
The Burglar's Discovery.
Herman
remained a few moments after this
hold charge from Wild buried in deep and
troubled thought. At length he raised his
head, and fixing hts eyes full upon him
said,
`Wilkins, you have guessed right. You are
my friend, and I will tell you the whole story!
He then went on to relate in detail the
incidents
as they occurred.
When Herman had ended his recital, the
events given in which have already been made
known to the reader,
*
*
See the novel entitled `La Bonita Cigarrera,'
or the `Beautiful Cigar Vender.'
the burglar captain.
started up with an exclamation of surprise
and admiration.
`This then is the way Shears came to his
end!' he at length said with deep emphasis.
`Well, I am glad this mystery is solved. I
never had anything perplex me so in my life
as accounting for his death! Well, Herman,
it was a bold deed and like yourself! Now
what have you in view touching this young
girl? It is plain that the one I saw you fight
so bravely for in the tap at `the Saracen,' and
the one you rescued from Shears, are one and
the same, though you have not yet acknow
ledged so much to me. You have read the
advertisement! It describes her exactly. A
thousand dollars isn't got every sunny
morning
!'
`What does your language mean?'
demanded
Herman, his brow darkening. `Do I
understand
you?'
`There is no use fooling the matter
Herman
between us. You acknowledge the young
girl to be the same advertised here?'
`I do; what then?' he demanded
haughtily
.
`That we give her up and go shares, half
and half in the reward!'
`Wild, are you in earnest?' he asked in a
tone fearfully subdued by his efforts to
suppress
his deep wrath.
`Yes, my boy!'
`So am I,' thundered Herman. `Dare to
think of carrying out this hellish plan of
yours, and you shall die by my hand! This
maiden has been reared and educated by my
mother as my sister! Such she is to me, and
as such I will protect her! Hear mefor now
you have unmasked yourselfI will deal in
plain words with you! By accident you have
recognized this person to be the original of
the picture you saw at Mr. Carrol's, and you
are the only one that recognises her to be the
one sought for by those who penned this
advertisement
.
Who they are, or why it is
written, I know not, nor do I care! But this
I say, that if you breathe a word of your
knowledge
to any living soul, I will be your
murderer
!'
`I do not fear your menaces, Herman,'
responded
Wild, with a reckless laugh; and at
the same time he began to move towards the
door, with the inward purpose to hasten at
once to the Astor House to give the
information
sought. But Herman divined his object,
and placed himself between him and the
door.
`By the Creator that made me, Wild, you
shall not stir out of this room till you have
sworn to keep silence touching this discovery
you have made!'
`Herman, this is going a little too far,'
cried Wild through his clenched teeth, his
eyes glowing with rage. `Let me pass out,
for I swear to you I will take no oath of yours
or any other man's dictation!'
`You will
not!
'
`No!' firmly answered the burglar captain,
and with the utterance of the words he drew
a pistol from his bosom and cocking it,
levelled
it at Herman's heart. `Stand back and
let me pass forth, or I pass across your body!'
Quick as this act of the burglar-captain had
been, the motion of Herman's hand, with
which he knooked the weapon from his grasp,
was quicker! Flying into the air it struck
the ceiling and exploded, while the two
men fiercely grappled with each other.
Herman
was struggling for the preservation of
her whom he loved better than life, and he
was resolved that the burglar should not
betray
her existence to those who would take
her from him forever! for he believed her
parents
were at length moving in this search
after her, and well aware that she must be of
a superior condition in life, he felt that her
discovery by them would prevent forever a
barrier to the union which (notwithstanding
all his crushed hopes) he still trusted might
be brought about according to his soul's
desire
;
for true love never desponds.
The contest was short but terrific. After a
little more than a minute from their first
falling
together upon the floor, the young man
rose to his feet, and wiping the red blood from
a seaman's clasp-knife, he closed it and
returned
it to his pocket! The burglar-captain
moved not! He lay upon his back with his
face upward! From his heart bubbled forth a
torrent of blood which formed a pool around
him. His features were fixed and his eye
glazed. He was dead!
CHAPTER XII.
The Rivals.
We
left our heroine at the apartments
which she had been turnishing for Madame
de Ruyter, and where Herman had his
unhappy
interview with her. He returned as
we have seen, to his mother's, where Wild
called upon him, the fatal issue of which
interview
we have just seen. After Herman
quitted Maria she sat down and wept for him,
and for herself, that she should be the cause
of his grief, for she felt grateful to him, and
wished from her heart she could requite his
affection. As the hour was now close at hand
when she should be at the shop, she dried her
tears and resuming her hat and shawl she
locked the neatly arranged rooms and tripped
lightly away towards her place of daily duties.
On her way she was turned aside from her
usual course by a crowd gathered around a
small building on fire, and to avoid it she
passed
into the street in which the stall of Brant
the Book-man was situated. She had not yet
got in sight of it, when Brant, who was
seated
in his dark box reading a newspaper, was
startled by the sudden and abrupt appearance
of Herman.
`Rolfe, you are my friend. Let me conceal
myself in your lodging-rooom! I have just
slain the burglar Wilkins Wild, and his body
is fresh and bleeding in the door of my
mother's
house, and which is round the corner,
beyond the Saracen's Head!'
`You have saved the judge and hangman
trouble, if you have killed this villain,'
answered
Rolfe with a smile of pleasure. `I
liked him not, for he always had an insult for
my deformity! Go in,' he continued,
throwing
open the low door in the rear of his stall.
There you will be safe, till some other place
offers! Did any one see you do the deed?'
`No one!'
`Then feel secure! I will shut you in, and
by and by, go up the street and see upon
whom men fasten suspicion.'
As the Book-man turned the key in the door
to his cell, for such the room in the rear of
his stall may very properly be termed, he cast
his eyes up and down the street, preparatory
to going on his mission. He suddenly started
and his cheeks became flushed while his eyes
sparkled with intense emotion. Not ten steps
from him approaching the stall along the
side-walk
,
he beheld the lovely girl whom he had
before seen accompanying Madame de
Ruyter
,
and for whom he had then been seized
with the most violent passiona passion that
changed his whole nature. A second time he
had seen her walking alone, and as he passed
her he sent forth his deep burning glance into
her eyes, and under his breath he whispered,
`For thy love, maiden, I would die!
Deformed
as I ambase and low as you see me,
I have a soul that can appreciate your worth.
Think of me sometimes, and do not despise
the true heart which for years has throbbed
only with throes of sorrow, until the sight of
your sweet countenance thrilled my veins
with joy unutterableand hopes high and
daring seized upon my thoughts. Nay!
tremble
not! Fly me not! Pass on thy way,
innocent
and fair! I have spoken with thee
and I am happy! Gobut I feel within my
soul's depths that you will never forget me!'
And the Book-man spoke truly. Though
surprised and alarmed at being thus
addressed
in the street by a stranger of such a
singular
aspect, Maria listened to his words with a
feeling akin to gentle pity, and wondering she
went on her way; but she could not banish
him from her mind. Her emotion when
Herman
alluded to him will be remembered by
the reader.
In her haste to reach her shop, Maria did
not think of the Book-man's stall being in her
way; for since he had met her and spoken
with her so strangely, she avoided the
neighborhood
of his dwelling. She first became
conscious of being near him by seeing his
dark eyes gazing upon her from beneath the
shadowy arches of his brows. Instinctively
she dropped her veil, and drawing it closely
around her face, she averted her head and
hurried
by. As she left the stall behind her she
almost flew!
`She fears aud shuns me!' he said bitterly.
`If I were shapely in person and fair in
visage
she would have smiled upon me! But
now as I am she avoids me as if I were
a wild beast! She must learn to
love
me! I
am hideoue without; but I will so make her
fall in love with my mind that she shall love
me! This passion I entertain for her is not
awakened to perish without purpose. Our
destinies are interwoven by fate, or my heart
would never have bounded to her foot-step as
it has done. Fly, maiden, fly! but we shall
meet again. She can be found at Herman's
mother's and her own! I will hie there now
and see what men say of this deed of blood.'
As he spoke he left his stall and took his
way in the direction of the Saracen's head.
When he reached the tavern and turned the
corner, he encountered a throng of people,
who were gathered around the dwelling where
Wild lay, having been drawn together by the
outcries raised by Madame de Ruyter on
returning
to her room and discovering the
murdered
man upon her floor. Maria had seen
the crowd, but had avoided it, being already
late for her duties at the shop, and not
knowing
the object which had set it in motion.
Rolfe reached the scene and listening to the
numerous conjectures of the multitude, was
satisfied that the true criminal was
unsuspected
.
He then approached Madame de
Ruyter who was pacing up and down her
room ringing her hands, for she believed that
Herman had done the murder, and she
trembled
lost she should each instant hear the cry
given of his being arrested.
`Calm yourself, madam,' said Rolfe in a
low tone. `Your son is safe. Your grief
will draw suspicion on you. Compose
yourself
and Herman will be with you as soon as
the momentary excitement passes. Where is
your child?'
`My child? you said he was safe? Is he
not in safety?' she asked wildly.
`I mean your daughter!'
`My daughter! Yesoh yesdid I say
she was
not
my daughter, sir?' she asked
bewildered
,
and looking as if she feared she had
unwittingly betrayed what she should kept
secret.
`No you did not.
Is
she thy daughter?'
asked the keenly watchful Book-man.
`She is the only daughter I ever had.'
`Madame, your answers are singular. You
have made me suspect she is not your child.
I never knew you had any other than
Herman
.'
`Who is she then if she be not my child?'
asked Madam de Ruyter with firmness,
sensible
of her danger.
`I know not,' answered Rolfe turning
away and mixing with the crowd, still
strongly
suspecting that the fair maiden was not the
sister of Herman; for the young seaman on
first returning home had inquired after, and
spoken of her with a tone more like that
of a lover than a brother. Nevertheless,' he
said as he walked slowly away towards his
stall, `nevertheless she
may
be his sister.
Now that I know her abode I will see her
again, for my life is hid in hers.'
`Well, Rolfe?' said Herman as the
Book-man
unlocked his door and entered the little
room in which he had left him.
`No one suspects you. You may venture
abroad in safety.'
`Thanks, good Brant. Did you see my
mother?
`Yes, and left her composed after assuring
her of your safety.'
`Thanks again.'
`Herman you have a sister,' said Rolfe in a
tone full of emphasis and feeling.
`Well?' responded Herman with surprise.
`
I love her!
' answered Brant in a voice that
came from the depths of his chest.
`Love her? cried Herman recoiling a step
and fixing his eyes fiercely upon him.
`Yes, Herman, dearer than life I love her.'
`Go onwhat
more?
' demanded Herman
pale as marble, his lips compressed and his
hand trembling though clinched till the nails
of the fingers met in the quick flesh of the
palms.
`I mean to woo and win her. We are
friends! I have moneyI am rich! I ask
your consent and I
`Rolfe'
`Why do you falter, Herman?' asked the
Book-man calmly.
`I will not falter, then! Know that my
sister can never love thee, and that you shall
never have my consent. Nayby the heaven
above our heads, if you dare think of her
again I will'
`Stop, Herman! I am satisfied now that
she is not your sister!'
`Who is she then?'
`The daughter of Mr. Carrol who so
mysteriously
disappeared seven years ago!'
`Ha?' gasped Herman.
`Read that advertisement. It throws light
upon by-gone events I have long had my
thoughts upon, and I believe that this
maiden
is the person here advertised, for you
disappeared at the same time she did; and
that very night I saw you from my stall in the
storm, convey something into your mother's
house, which, after I heard of the child's dis
appearance I knew must have been a little
girl. But I saw no more of you and the
subject
escaped me. Now I find in your
mother's
house (and
loved
by you, for you cannot
disguise it,) a maiden who is neither her
daughter, nor your sister, and who answers
perfectly to the description in this
advertisement
.
Read it!'
`I have read it, Brant,' answered Herman,
hoarsely. `Would you also claim the
reward
?
Beware! It was for this I slew Wild!'
`No. I desire no other reward than her
young heart! Perish the money! I love her
and it shall be my part to keep her existence
secret from those who seek her. She must be
mine
, and none other's!'
`
Thine
accursed!' cried Herman, seizing
him by the throat, fierce with rage, that he
should dare to speak of love with reference to
one he adored, as he did his lovely
foster-sister
!
`Herman, take off your hands' Goad me not
to resentment!' shrieked the Book-man.
`I will tear out thy foul tongue?'
`Forbear and unloose my throat, or I will
kill thee!'
`Base spawn I defy thee! To dare lift your
thoughts to
her!
It is madness! Down, and
grovel in the dust, hound!'
Herman, as he spoke tried to press the head
of the dwarf to the earth, so that he could
place his foot upon his neck. But strong as
he was, he miscalculated his own powers,
compared with that of the massive-shouldered
Book-man. With a strong exertion of
muscular
strength. Rolfe threw him from him,
and then uttering a short, panther-like cry,
he sprung upon him, and clasped his long,
thin fingers about his neck. He then dashed
his large head violently several times in rapid
succession into his face, till the poor young
man suffocated and overpowered fell
backward
heavily to the floor, where he lay as
insensible
as marble. The Book-man drew
from his bosom a slender
machete
, and
stooping
over him drove it to the hilt in his heart!
Thrice he repeated the blow, and then
getting
up he said as he gazed upon him,
`There lies the only man, who stood
between
me and happiness! Thus let him
perish
,
who dares to be Rolfe Brant's rival in
love!'
CHAPTER XIII.
The Mystery Unraveled.
It
was about half past seven o'clock, the
evening of the day on which these tragic
events occurred, that lord Delorme and his
sister, lady Lessington were seated at the
teatable
in their rooms at the Astor. They were
speaking of the extraordinary series of
circumstances
,
by which they had obtained
intelligence
of the lost ehild up to her
disappearance
from the house of Mr. Carrol, and
were sadly discussing the hopeless chances
that they should ever hear of her again.
`What can Edward have meant,' said lady
Lessington, `by his wild words just now, and
rising from the table, and rushing out as he
did so like a mad-man, crying, `I have it! I
have it! The riddle is solved, and it is she!
`I cant explain his conduct. But all day
he has had something in his thoughts
perplexing
,
and once I heard him say, to himself, the
face of that child's portrait haunts me, with a
vague resemblance to some one, and each
instant
I would fix upon the person the
connecting
link I sought would vanish!' Evidently
he has seen some one whom the portrait
reminds
him of, but who it is he is not able to
fasten upon!'
`It would be extraordinary if Edward had
by chance met with her somewheres, and now
traces the resemblance! Perhaps his sudden
departure from the table and his words had
something to do with the fastening this
resemblance
upon the person whose image has
been vaguely seen in his mind!'
They were right in their conjectures. Lord
Edward had again and again that day gazed
upon the portrait of the lovely child which
was in lord Delorme's possession, and the
more he gazed the more certain he felt that
he had somewheres seen the face! But where,
as is often the case, in seeking out vaguely
defined resemblances in the memory, he had
met with it, he found it impossible to tell.
The reader, however, will be at no loss! and
when it is borne in mind that the likeness he
was trying to fix and individualize, was that
of a portrait of a young girl at ten, and the
face of the same person beheld in her
seventeenth
year, his perplexity will not be
surprising
.
But all day his thoughts were upon
it, when suddenly the truth flashed upon his
mind at a moment, when he had the portrait
and the face of the lovely girl at ths same
instant
in his mind. Then face answered to
face as in a mirror, and their identity was
clear, and decided.
He hastened from the hotel to the
VignMort
and not finding her there in an assumed
careless tone inquired for her of the
proprietor
.
From him he understood that she had
gone to her mother's, having been sent for on
account of her sudden illness. The scenes
she had gone through that day had deeply
affected
this lady and when she sent for Maria
to see her she was near her end. Of the
murder of Herman she had not heard, for the
Book-man having done the deed in secret took
care to remove the body and all traces of their
act of blood from his dark and solitary abode.
On reaching the dwelling of Madam de
Ruyter, Lord Edward ascended the stairs and
entered the room. Upon the bed lay the
dying
woman. Over her, bent weeping, the
lovely girl he sought. The young
nobleman
advanced with sympathy in his looks
and knelt by the side of the bed with an air
of respectful sorrow. Maria on seeing him
blushed deeply and would have risen but he
said to her
`Do not move. Let us together watch her
last moments!'
`Is it the noble youth? Ah, sir, Heaven
has sent you,' said the dying woman with
faint articulation. `You are good and
honorable
,
for I see these sentiments in your
countenance. You are her only protector
under God. To you I solemnly commit her!'
`I take the trust which you confide to me,
in truth and sincerity, my dear Madam!'
answered
Lord Edward with emotion. `Tell
me then truly, is she your daughter?'
`Nono! I have deceived full long! Do
not trouble, Maria! The knowledge of the
truth will not now affect you. You need not
now fear exposure with being charged with
the murder of that man Shears, which alone
has so long intimidated you! No, sir, she is
not my daughter! A burglar in breaking
into the house of Mr. Carrol, not finding
booty, seized upon her, believing her to be
his child, hoping to get large ransom fer her.
My son slew him and rescued the child whom,
boy as he was, he loved and conveyed her
to my house. Then, at his urgent desire I
connived at the concealment of the sweet
child whom he resolved never to part from.
She was prevented from making known who
she was by the subtilty of Herman, who
excited
her apprehensions with the idea that as
she would be asserted as the murderer of the
man who carried her off, he being killed by
Herman in her presence! If I have done
wrong God knows I have repented it!'
`You have doubtless done wickedly,
madam
,'
said the young man. `But Providence
has directed these things to a termination you
little anticipated. I will tell you what will
rolieve your mind at this solemn hour. Here
is an advertisement,' he continued taking a
paper from his pocket, `which please listen
to!'
When he had ended reading it, the poor
woman clasped her hands together in deep
emotion.
`Oh, sir, do her parents live?'
`Yesher father! He is now in this city!
He is an English nobleman and my uncle.
Satisfied that this lovely girl was her we
sought, I came here to question her as to her
only recollections. Your words have left no
room for doubt. This young girl is my cousin
and to my mother, who is in the city, I shall
at once consign her. You see, therefore, that
she will not be without suitable protectors!'
Madame de Ruyter extended her arms with
an expression of deep joy upon her pale
countenance
to embrace Maria, and then pressing
the hand of the young nobleman she said
fervantly
,
`Now do I die in peace!'
The next moment the spirit of Madam de
Ruyler had taken its flight.
The surprise and joy of the young maiden
on hearing the words of Lord Edward were at
once lost in the deep grief with which the loss
of her dear friend and foster-mother
overwhelmed
her. At length soothed by her
noble
cousin, and feeling that all she had heard
him say was a dream, she suffered him to
conduct
her to a carriage, which he had called to
as it was going by, and convey her to his
mother and her father!
The seene that passed on the entrance of
Lord Edward with the lovely girl, whose
features clearly spoke her claim to her noble
birth-right, cannot be described. She gave
her happy father her whole story, while Lord
Edward sat at her, listening with deep and
tender interest, and perfectly happy that he
could now make his wife her, to whom, in a
humble station, he had lost his heart.
After some discussion as to the best mode of
proceeding, now that she was once more in
their possession it was decided unanimously
that there should be nothing said to the
proprietor
of the cigar-mart, nor to any person
whatsoever touching this discovery of her
birth; but that she should leave with them
early the next day for Boston, and at once
proceed with them to England. The motive
for this secrecy was to spare her own feelings
as well as those of her father in her new
position
,
by protecting her from any allusion to
her late situation as a cigar-girl; it being
deemed best that this precauiion should be
made to guard her against any reproach tha
might follow her into the new life before her.
The next day, therefore, the whole party
left for Boston, and two days afterwards took
the packet for England. The mystery that
involved her sudden disappearance and the
excitement it produced in New York is already
familiar to the reader. Three years careful
education under the best tutors and
governnesses
completed her education, and in her
twentieth year Lord Edward led her to the
altar, where all joined in confessing her to be
the loveliest and most accomplished bride that
had for years graced the nuptial records of
any one of the British aristocracy.
Brant the Book-man, who had never been
suspected of murdering Herman, who, indeed,
had not been missed, had not believed, from
the first, in the death of the lovely girl, and
used every means, and expending much
money, to ascertain where she was, but
without
success. At length after she had been
absent a little more than three years he
believed
he had got trace of her, which was very
favorable; for in a few days aftewards he
sailed in the steamer for England, since when
we have lost all knowledge of him.
THE END.
