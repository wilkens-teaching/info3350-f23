VOLUME I.
The PETITION.
I Should
like to know the certainty of it,
said
I,
putting the petition into my pocket.It contained
an account of an unfortunate
tradesman
reduced to
want, with a wife and three
small
children.He
asked
not charity for
himself
, but them.I
should
like
to know the certainty of it,
said
Ithere are
so
many
feigned tales of
distress
, and the world is
so
full
of duplicity, that in following the dictates of
humanity
we often encourage
idleness
.Could I but be
satisfied
of the authenticity of this man's
story
, I
would do
something
for him.
Will your honour
please
to
send
an
answer
?
said
the child, that brought the petition.
I had forgot herby the unaffected innocence of
her countenance,
she
could
scarcely
have
seen
nine
years.
Meekness
smiled
in her
sweet
eyeswhat a
lovely flower,
said
I'tis a pity the chilling breath
of
sorrow
should
visit
thee too rudelyI gave her
half a guinea, and bid her tell her father to come to
me the next morning.
The WISH.
How
happy
should
I be if
some
good fairy, as in
days of yore, would give me the power of
visiting
unseen
,
the receptacles of the
miserable
, and the
habitations
of vice and luxury.What a
satisfa
ction I
should
feel in rewarding and
supporting
merit; or
withdrawing the veil, and
discovering
the hideous
apect
of
hypocrisy
.
Besides
,
says
self
-love, I
should
then have an opportunity of
discovering
the
sentiments
of the world concerning
myself
. I
should
find my real friends, and detect my enemies.If
half my fortune could procure
such
a power, I would
freely give it.
Search your heart, replies a
soft
voice, and
see
if
it is not an unwarrantable
curiosity
, rather than a
real
wish
to do good, that now
inspires
you.
It is
strange
,
said
I; I hear a voice, but
see
no
person
near me;
surely
I do not dream!
Be not
surprised
, continued my
invisible
companion
,
I am your guardian genius, and have it in my
power to comply with your
wishes
, provided they
are corrected by
reason
.Look on that table and
you will
see
a ring, which, when on your finger,
will render you
invisible
; and, as long as humanity,
honor, or
friendship
, leads you to
use
it, it will
contribute
to your
happiness
; but whenever you
endeavour
to make it
subservient
to any unworthy
purpose
,
it will lead you into innumerable
difficulties
.
I thanked the kind genius,
instantly
seized
the
treasure
, put it on my finger, and, eager to try the
experiment, walked out.
The STREET.
I'll
bet you ten to one,
said
a noted gambler to
another;they were walking arm in armI'll bet
you ten to one I am married before this day
fortnight
.You
are a lucky dog, Cogdie, replied his
companion, to obtain
so
lovely a woman as
Melissa
,
and twenty
thousand
pounds into the bargain.
Dn the woman,
said
the wretch, it is money I
want: by Heavens I have not five guineas left in the
world, and am twice as many hundred in debt. If
I do not
succeed
in this matrimonial
scheme
, I
shall
go to limbo.There's an old prying cat of a
maiden
aunt
stands
devilishly
in the way, or I could
easily
dupe the old dad.As to
Melissa
herself
,
she
's
such
a mere
simpleton
in the ways of the world, that it
requires but a
small
share
of art to make her believe
almost
any thing.
By this time they had reached the
house
of the
intended victim, when finding my ring had the
desired
effect, I entered the
house
with her betrayer.
His companion
wished
him good morning, and I,
without
hesitation
, followed him up
stairs
.
The DRAWING ROOM.
A venerable
old man was
sitting
on a
sopha
;
the hoary ornaments of his head
inspired
the mind
with awe, while the benignity of his countenance
encouraged and invited
friendship
.
Beside
him,
reading
Thomson
's
Seasons
,
sat
his daughter,
lovely
and blooming as Aurora, when with
rosy
fingers
on a
sweet
May morn
she
unbars the gates of light.
As Cogdie approached, her features were
enlivened
with a glow that plainly told me her heart was
not her own; and the cordiality with which her
father
received him, evinced the integrity of his own
heart, as he
suspe
not the integrity of another.
After the
usual
compliments, the little party being
seated
, Cogdie informed the old gentleman that he
had been prevented the honor of dining with him
that day by a
tradesman
to whom he owed about
thirty pounds, which, as he had not lately received
remittances from his father, he found it
inconvenient
just
then to pay; that the man would take no
denial, but had threatened to
arrest
him. I
must
be
obliged to borrow this paltry
sum
, continued he, till
I can write again to my father.You
shall
not be
distressed
for
such
a trifle,
said
the old gentleman, I
will lend it you.
He left the room to get the money, when the
unfeeling
Cogdie made
use
of that opportunity to
persuade
the
heedless
unsuspecting
Melissa
to elope.
Thou art
worse
than a midnight ruffian,
said
I
thou art
stealing
the peace of a man who is at this
moment contributing to thine. They had
just
time
to appoint the day, hour, and place of rendezvous,
when
Melissa
's father returned with the money.
I had heard enough, and quitted the room as the old
gentleman entered.
The REFLECTION.
That
a man who has a wife and numerous
family
of children, and
sees
them plunged in the
deepest
distress
,
should
rob to keep them from
starving
,
is not a matter of
surprise
and while
stern
Justice
holds the balance, angel-like pity gently turns
the
scale
.But that a man in full health and vigour,
with
strength
and abilities to
support
himself
, who
has no weeping wife or
famished
children to urge
him to the deed;
should
cozen and defraud his
best
friend, debauch the morals of an innocent girl, and
plunge her into ruin, only to obtain a larger
share
of
sordid
ore, is to me unaccountable. It is an act
that makes humanity
shrink
back
aghast
:
Justice
with
srowns
unsheaths
her
sword
, and pity weeps
but for the offender's crimes.
I will
rescue
Melissa
,
said
I
she
may hereafter
thank me. The thought filled my mind with
unusual
complacency.I enjoyed in idea the
satisfaction
and gratitude of her father, when he beheld his
darling
rescued
from the jaws of
destruction
.
It was a fine evening in the month of June;
so
removing the ring from my finger, I
stepped
into a
fruiterer's,
purchased
a bottle of
strawberries
, walked
into the Park, and
seated
myself
in one of the chairs.
My mind was at that moment a
sort
of vacuum,
my thoughts unemployed, when
casting
my eyes
upon the paper that covered the
strawberries
, I
perceived
it was part of a fairy tale, but wrote in an
uncommon poetic
stile
.
The FRAGMENT.
Fair Cynthia now, bright
Empress
of the night,
Mounted her azure throne with diamonds
studded
;
Her
modest
face, veil'd in a fleecy cloud.
Which, as it partly hid, heighten'd her beauties.
When fair Alzada, weary and forlorn,
Pensive
sat
down
beside
a murm'ring
stream
,
With nought to
shield
her from nocturnal dews,
Saving an ancient oak,
whose
sturdy
boughs
Had brav'd the
storms
of many a winter
past
.
Her lovely head reclin'd upon her hand;
Her eyes were rais'd with
servour
toward Heav'n.
In
those
bright orbs
started
a pearly drop,
Which, as it fell, another took its place,
And that, too, fell and
kiss
'd its
pleasing
way
In quick
succession
down her ruby cheeks.
Ah! me,
she
cried, how wretched is my fate,
Forc'd from my royal parents, and my home;
What
hospitable
roof will now receive me,
Or where
shall
poor Alzada lay her head.
In this lone wild I
see
no trace of mortals;
No lowing herds
bespeaks
a
mansion
near;
No bleating flock breaks this
most
solemn
silence
;
And ere another heavy hour is
past
,
Perhaps
some
savage
monster
, fierce for prey,
On me may
satisfy
his craving hunger.
The genius Abradan beheld her
sorrows
;
In a plain
rustic
form conceal'd his own,
And thus
address
'd the
sadly
weeping fair.
Fair daughter of affliction, follow me;
I come to lead you to a
festive
board,
Where
social
mirth and innocence
preside
,
And where the
smiling
host
shall
bid you wel-
come.
The trembling
Princess
left her
mossy
seat
,
And without
speaking
followed her kind guide.
When
sudden
clouds
obscur
'd the face of Heav'n;
The thunders roll'd the forked lightnings
flash
'd,
And all around was horror and amazement;
Alzada
sunk
in terror to the ground.
A death-like
swoon
seal
'd up each active
sense
.
The
tempest
ceas'd. She rais'd her fearful eyes,
And
saw
before her a fair lofty palace:
The gates were
solid
brass
; and the
supporters
Marble, twin'd round with vine leaves wrought in gold.
She enter'd, and was
instantly
surrounded
By
seven
young virgins, clad in azure blue,
With
alabaster
vases
in their hands,
Who paid the homage to a
princess
due.
They
shed
around her
numberless
perfumes,
And o'er her threw a robe, of
spotless
white,
Then led her to a room within the palace,
Where, on a throne of
amethyst
and gold,
There
sat
a Monarch of
majestic
port;
Who,
rising
, welcom'd the admiring
princess
,
And plac'd her on a
shining
throne
beside
him.
They brought her
baskets
of the
choicest
fruits,
And water from the
purest
limpid
stream
.
Alzada being
refresh
'd,
rose
from her
seat
,
And thus
address
'd the
master
of the
feast
.
Who e'er thou art, great King,
whose
magic pow'r,
Has brought me to this place, where
farthest
Ind'
Seems to have empti'd her
exhaustless
store
To add to its magnificence:
Say, can you guide a
helpless
wand'ring maid,
To find the home where late
she
was
so
blest
;
From whence the
sorceress
Zelubia forc'd her,
And left her parents to bewail her
loss
.
To which the Monarch, with a
smile
, reply'd,
Lovely Alzada,
fairest
of thy
sex
,
Whose
charms triumphant rule this royal heart,
Dry up thy tears. By this right hand I
swear
,
Ere Phbus
harnesses
his fiery
steeds
,
And leaves his
sea
-green couch to
visit
mortals,
I will conduct you to your father's court,
And guard you from the vile Zelubia's pow'r.
Slaves bring my chariot. Bid the virgins wait,
And
strew
fresh
flow'rs where'er Alzada treads.
The chariot was of curious
workmanship
,
Ivory, gold, coral, and precious
stones
;
Around it hover'd little laughing loves;
And on each
side
were rang'd fair village maids,
With lutes, and harps, tabors, and
shepherds
' pipes,
Singing and playing
soft
harmonious airs.
Eight milk-white
steeds
,
I turned the paper, but there was no more
There are times when the mind is affected by mere
trifles;
such
now was my
case
I was vexed at not
finding the
conclusion
of the
story
, and determined
to go back to the fruiterer's, and inquire if they had
the remainder.A few moments brought me to the
place.
The FRUITERER's
A crowd
was
assembled
before the door.
Forgetting
what I came for, friend,
said
I
addressing
myself
to the
master
of the
shop
, can you tell me the
cause
of this
bustle
?It is a very extraordinary one,
Sir, he replied.A boy about ten years old, going to
a
shop
hard by to
purchase
something
for his
mother
,
was recollected by a
tradesman
to whom his
father
owed a
considerable
sum
of money, and who
had
just
before employed a bailiff to
arrest
him.
The man inquired of the child where his father
lived
,
and upon his
refusing
to tell, offered him money,
and
promised
him a great many fine things; but
finding that plan equally ineffectual, he proceeded to
threats. Upon which, the boy
burst
into tears, and
seating
himself
upon
some
steps
opposite
, declared he
would
stay
there all night rather than give them an
opportunity of
sending
his father to jail.
The boy has the
spirit
of a Roman,
said
I.How
many a man will feel the
blush
of
conscious
guilt
upon his cheek, when he
shall
be told of this; for,
Oh!
shame
to humanity and manhood, how many
would
sell
their country through avarice, or betray
it through fear.While this magnanimous boy
refuses
a bribe, though poverty might induce him to
take it, and dares brave the threats of an inhuman
wretch, rather than betray his father, though his
childhood might
excuse
even cowardice.I will go
and
speak
to the creditor,
said
Iperhaps I may
persuade
him to drop his
design
of
arresting
the poor
man, and then I will follow the boy home.
The CREDITOR.
Pray
, Sir, how much does this boy's father
owe you?
C
Eighteen pounds, replied the man.
And are you really
distressed
for the money?
No; thank my prudence for that; I have taken
care of the main chance, and not like Heartfree,
loved others more than
myself
.
I fear you have not loved them
so
well, my
friend.
Why no, to be
sure
! I follow the
first
law of
nature
,
self
-
preservation
.
And why not follow the
first
rule of
Christianity
,
to do as you would be done by?
Why look ye, Sir; I always pay my debts
punctually
,
and I expect others
should
pay me as
punctually
.
Certainly.But
suppose
a man who has an
honest
heart,
should
, by unavoidable misfortunes, be
rendered
unable to
discharge
his debts; is it not better
to
trust
to his honor, rather than by confining him,
put it entirely out of his power to pay you at all?
Trust
to his honoreh! you know but little of
this world, to talk at that rate: why this very
Heartfree
was ruined by
trusting
to a
person
's honor. An
old officer lodged in his
house
for many years,
borrowed
money of him, run in his debt for linen for
his whole family, and when I have talked to
Heartfree
about the impropriety of his conduct in not
asking
for payment, he would
answer
I am
sure
he
will pay me whenever he has it in his powerbut
before it was in his power, he died, leaving four
children without the
least
support
. The
eldest
was
about twenty; a fine young girl to be
sure
, but
she
had been brought up in
idleness
. She could
embroider
,
draw, dance,
sing
, and play upon the
spinnet
;
but that would not keep her;
so
I
advised
Heartfree to try and get her a place to wait on a
lady
.
To put the two younger girls out apprentice,
and take the boy to go of errands, clean
shoes
,
knives, &c, in his own kitchen; but he
forsooth
said
no; the children of a man who had
spent
his
days in the
service
of his country,
should
never want
an
asylum
while he had a
house
; nor the innocent
orphans want a friend, while he lived:
so
he
married
the
eldest
, and put her
sisters
to
school
, were,
luckily, they both died.The boy he
sent
to the
East
Indies about
seven
years ago, after
spending
an enormous
sum
on his education.His wife bred
very
fast
, and was quite the fine lady;
so
what with
extravagance, and a few
losses
, from being one of
the
first
linen-drapers in the city, he is become a
bankrupt, and, as I
suppose
, has not bread to eat.
And for his humanity,
said
Iyou would reward
him with a
prison
; rob his wife and children of their
only comfort, the
presence
of their father and their
friendand of what
use
will it be to you?
I don't know that it will be of much
use
to
me
, he
replied; but it will teach Heartfree to remember
himself
before others, another time.
The remembrance of what he has done for others,
said
I,
so
far from
sitting
painful on his mind, will
smooth
the thorny pillow of
distress
, and make even
a
prison
pleasant
; he
shall
sleep
soundly
on a bed
of
straw
, and dream of
those
whose
sorrows
he has
lightened, while you
shall
feel
scorpions
on a bed
of down: nor
shall
the
sweet
restorer
of tired nature
visit
you,
unless
it be to fright you with
some
dreadful
vision
of
prisons
and
starving
wretches.
I turned from him with
honest
indignation, and
calling to the fruiterer, gave him the money to
discharge
the debt.I would not
trust
myself
to
speak
to the man again who could
so
shamefully
trample
on the laws of humanity.The poor boy was
weeping
,
his face hid with his hands. Go home, child,
said
Iyour father's debt is paid. He
staid
not to
thank me; but the
pleasure
that
sparkled
in his eye,
the agility with which he
sprang
from his
seat
, and
flew towards his home, conveyed a greater
pleasure
to my heart, than the
most
eloquent
effusions
of
gratitude
.I
was willing to be a
witness
of his relating
the
story
to his parents;
so
putting on my ring. I
followed him
unseen
.
The FAMILY.
As
I
ascended
a narrow winding
stair
-
case
, I
perceived
in a
small
room, the door of which was
partly
open, an elegantly-formed woman,
sitting
on the
side
of a wretched bed, on which lay a man, the
picture of famine. On her knee
sat
a lovely infant,
who with her little hand was wiping off the tears
that trickled down her mother's cheeks.The little
boy,
breathless
with impatience,
rushed
into the
roomPapaMamma'tis paidyou
shall
not go
to
prison
I would not tell where you lived;
indeed
he was very angry; but that good
gentleman
My dear boy, cried the fond mother, why do you
talk
so
incoherently? Who has frightened my child?
What is the matter with you?
He endeavoured to tell his
story
with propriety.
It was in vain, joy had entirely unconnected his
ideas; but he made
himself
understood
.
Oh! thou
sensualist
,
couldst
thou but in
imagination
taste
the luxury of my feelings at this moment,
thou
wouldst
henceforth forego the gratification of
thy
grosser
appetites, to
feast
thy mind with the
highest
of human
pleasures
.
I
saw
the
honest
fruiterer enter with
some
supplies
which I had judged might be
necessary
for
people
in their condition. He repeated every
circumstance
,
only concealing my name.
I was preparing to leave the room, when a child
entered, whom I
instantly
knew to be my little
petitioner
I
will
see
thee again to-morrow,
said
I
but will now
seek
my lovely Emma, and engage her
in thy behalf.
The RESOLUTION.
It
was more than I could conveniently afford,
said
Iwhen I found how much money I had expended
Twenty pounds is a good
sum
, but it will
cost
me
much more before I have placed Heartfree in a
situation
more
suitable
to his meritbut no matter, I
will
discharge
one of my
servants
: why
should
I
keep two footmen, when a man of greater worth is
in want of even the common
necessaries
of life?
my dear Emma will, I am
sure
, agree to this
proposal
.My
phton and
horses
, too, I will
dispose
of;
one carriage is enough; what
business
have I with
superfluities
? the money this requires will be much
better employed in relieving the unfortunate. I
will be generous, but I will not be imprudentmy
Emma, and her dear little Harriet,
shall
not
suffer
for my benevolence.
I had reached my own
mansion
; a
smile
of
chearfulness
,
that ever graced my Emma's face, bade me
welcome.
I communicated my
proposal
, and related
Heartfree's
case
.She
smiled
assent
, and the
smile
was
rendered doubly enchanting, accompanied by the
tear of
sensibility
.
Retiring, I
passed
through my Harriet's chamber
sweet
are the
slumbers
of the innocent. I
feasted
my eyes upon her infant beauties, and retired to
rest
with a mind
so
serene
, that I envied not the
greatest
monarch, and forgave even my
bitterest
enemies.

The MORNING RAMBLE.
Who
will pretend to
say
that early
rising
does
not afford us many
pleasures
, and contribute to our
health?how charming to
see
the beauteous orb of
day,
rising
supremely
bright, to enliven nature, and
tinge with gold the lofty mountains' tops.The
country is the place to enjoy
these
beauties; but even
near London we may find
pleasant
walks.I had
ascended
a hillhow charming was the
prospect
fields crowned with
rising
plenty; the
peasants
blithly
singing
as they labour.
These
people
seem
happy, but they are not to be envied; they work
hard for their bread, and if their rude,
unpolished
minds are callous and unfeeling in
distress
, they are
likewise
insensible
to many of the
pleasures
that
await
them; the works of nature afford them no
satisfaction
,
because
they cannot contemplate their
beauties; yet their minds are
suited
to their
station
;
refinement would be no
blessing
to them, and the
best
security
the
peasant
has for
happiness
, is
ignorance
.
These
were my reflections, as I rambled towards
Hampstead
.
Give me a draught of milk, my dear,
said
I, to
a
rosy
damsel
.She
blushed
,
curtsied
aukwardly,
and complied
she
trembled as
she
presented
it.
Were you ever in love?
said
I, as I took the milk.
Never but once, and
please
your honor.
And are you not in love now?
No.
No! and how happens that?
I am going to be married to-morrow.
And you don't think love
necessary
in
matrimony
?
Father
says
I
shall
love my
husband
as
soon
as I
am married,
And pray who was you in love with?
Colin; his cottage was
close
by ours; we were
born on the
same
day, and when we were children
we
used
to play together. If Colin had
some
fruit
he would
save
a part for me; and when
strange
gentlemen
or ladies gave him half-pence, he
shared
them
with me: when we grew older, he would tend my
sheep
, watch my young lambs, and bring home my
cows; and if I'd had a brother, your honor, he
could not have been kinder, nor, I am
sure
, I could
not have loved him better;
so
he axed father to let
us be married; but Colin was but a
shepherd
's boy,
and I was father's only child,
so
he
said
he could
give me fifty pounds, and I might have a match
better
than Colin
so
we
kissed
and partedand
to-morrow
I am to be married to farmer
Willson
, who
is old and lame, but he
says
I
shall
have a mort of
fine thingstho', to tell the truth, I had rather
wear my own
linsey
jacket, and be married to Colin.
And
so
you
shall
, my
sweet
simple
rustic
,
said
I
Her father was one of my tenantsI took out my
pocket-book, wrote a line or two on my tablet, and
bade her give it to her father.
What a
curse
this pride is,
said
I, as I directed
my
steps
towards Londonbut that this haughty
dame
should
stoop
to inhabit a cottage, is wondrous
strange
Why a peer of the realm could but have
made his daughter
miserable
, to
preserve
the dignity
of his
house
, but in the name of common
sense
,
what has a
peasant
to do with pride of family?
The INN YARD.
My
dear friend, you are heartily welcome to town,
said
a
spruce
-
dressed
citizen, as he helped his
country
friend to alight from the Norfolk
stage
. Pray
come home with me; I expect you will make my
house
your own while you
stay
in town; there is
nothing in my power I will not do to make it
agreeable
to you. I have depended upon your company;
my whole
house
is at your
service
.
This over-acted
complaisance
made me
suspect
his
sincerity
, or that he had
some
sinister
point in
view;
so
putting my ring on my finger, I followed
them home.
The DISCOVERY.
I am
greatly obliged to you
said
the country
gentleman
,
as he
sat
down to the
breakfast
table; the
invitation you have have given me is very
acceptable
;
I have
lost
the
estate
I have been
so
long at law
about, for want of
sufficient
evidence; and after I
have paid the
costs
, I
shall
not have more than two
hundred pounds left, with which I mean to
purchase
an annuity; therefore I
shall
make your
house
my
home, till I can
settle
my affairs.
It may be
some
time before you can
settle
your
business
to your
satisfaction
, replied the citizen, his
features contracting into cold civility; and I expect
a gentleman to take my
first
floor in about a week;
I am very
sorry
I cannot accommodate you longer.
My dear Mr. Woollet cried the wife,
hastily
entering
,
I am
vastly
glad to
see
you.
Mr. Woollet has
lost
his
lawsuit
, my dear,
said
the
husband
.
The
smile
of welcome was
instantly
changed into
a look of amazementShe had advanced to give him
her hand, but on his attempting to
salute
her,
she
withdrew her cheek, exclaiming I am
sorry
for his
disappointment
and began to make the tea.
He drank two
dishes
of tea, and then
asked
his
friend to lend him two guineas.He had it not in
the
house
.Trade was very precariousagain
mentioned
his expected lodger, and recommended a
mean room to his friend at half a crown per week, in
an
obscure
lane in the city.
Oh!
self
-
interest
, how
dost
thou deaden every
virtue
;
lead to
hypocrisy
and vice, and make us what
we
should
be
ashamed
to own, mean, avaricious, and
unfeeling.Would I change the feeling heart for all
the
interested
views this world affords? Oh, no!
give me
sensibility
to feel another's woe, and I
shall
then feel, as I ought, my own
happiness
.
The SURPRISE.
It
is vexatious,
said
Mr. Woollet, as he
arose
from
breakfast
, that I cannot
stay
here, as I have no
ready money to procure a lodging.No
answer
was
made.
Can't I have a room on your
second
floor, Mrs.
Saveall?
Really, Sir, they are all occupied.
I do not know what to do; I
must
beg you to
lend me half a guinea till next week.
I cannot, upon my word, Sir.
Mr. Woollet
summoned
up a look of
expressive
anger and contempt, and fixing his eyes on his
false
friend, cried, He who can
refuse
half a guinea to my
necessities
,
shall
never
share
my
prosperity
. Know,
selfish
man, I have gained my
cause
, and am, at this
moment,
master
of two
thousand
pounds per annum.
Then turning from them,
hastily
left the
house
.
I
stood
for a moment to view their
confusion
;
they
spoke
not a word, but giving each other the
keenest
looks of reproach,
separated
in
sullen
silence
.
At that
instant
, Heartfree
shot
across
my mind,
I quitted the
house
, and removing the ring from my
finger, walked home.
The BREAKFAST.
She
was
listening
with attention to Heartfree,
who was relating the
story
of
last
night. She knew
it before, but
still
it was
pleasing
, for it was in
praise
of the man
she
loved.Harriet had made an
acquaintance
with my little petitioner; was
displaying
her toys, and teaching her to
dress
her doll.
I have made you wait, my Emma,
said
I
Heartfree
rose
from his
seat
, bowed, and
cast
down his
eyes, while his cheeks were dyed with
crimson
it
was a
blush
neither
expressive
of guilt nor
shame
it
was a
blush
occasioned
only by the pain a noble heart
feels when in a
state
of
despondence
. I took no
notice of it, but began a
conversation
on indifferent
subjects
his
confusion
gradually
decreased
, and in
less
than half an hour was quite
dissipated
.
I
settled
a plan for his future
subsistence
he left
me in
haste
to carry the joyful tidings to his wife
he was beyond
expression
happy, nor was I a jot
behind
him in that particular.My Harriet could not
part with her little play-fellow.She
shall
live with
you, Harriet,
said
I;
so
she
shall
, papa, and ride
in my coach, and wear my fine thingswon't you,
Lucy?
She looked up at me with a countenance I
shall
never forget.
And
shall
I never
see
mamma, then? and
must
she
still
live in that dark room?
I was willing to try her.You
shall
stay
here,
Lucy,
said
I, but you
must
not
see
your mamma, nor
can I help her living in that little dark room.
She
surveyed
the apartment
she
was in, as though
making a
comparison
.
It is a fine place,
said
she
; but if my mamma
cannot take a part of
these
fine things, I had rather
go home again.
Oh! exclaimed Emma, who can
say
that
Heartfree
is poor; fate has indeed robbed him of his
wealth, but Heaven in return has given him an
invaluable
treasure
in his children.
The LESSON.
It
was about two years after, when my Emma,
Harriet, Lucy, and
myself
, were on a
visit
to
Heartfree
.His
brother had returned from India with a
fortune equal to their
most
sanguine
wishes
.In
rural retirement, about twenty miles from London,
they lived in complete
happiness
, having been taught
the value of
present
blessings
, by
past
scenes
of
sorrow
.
It was a night when the contending elements
seemed
to threaten the earth with
dissolution
; the
forked lightening rived the
sturdy
oaks; the
bursting
and
almost
incessant
peals of thunder made
all nature tremble. The whirlwind raged, the
gleaming
meteors
shewed
the
distant
foaming
sea
, its
proud
unsettled
waves that
seemed
to wage war with
the black impending
sky
.It was a night of horror.
It was a night to make a man remember on what a
slender
thread his life depends. The
vast
universe
is but an atom that with one
blast
from the Creative
Power might
vanish
into air, and leave no trace of
planets, earth, or
sea
, but all again be
universal
chaos.
It
ceased
. The moon broke from behind a jetty
cloud, tinged round with
silver
the wind
passed
gently over the trees and herbage,
whose
leaves had
caught the late
descending
shower
, and glittered in
the moon beams.
The
tempest
was dreadful,
said
I, but it has
cleared
the air of all noxious vapours; and how
beautiful
appears the face of nature, heightened by the
remembrance
of the late
scene
of horror!
Just
so
it
is with life; none can enjoy the
pleasures
of
prosperity
so
well as
those
who have felt the pangs of
adversity
.
Our ears were invaded by a groan; it came from
the road; we followed the
sound
, and found a man
lying on the ground, bleeding, and
almost
naked.
We bore him to the
house
, his wounds were
dressed
,
and it was judged
rest
would be his
best
restorer
.
In the morning he was unable to
rise
. I
proposed
to Heartfree to
visit
him; we entered the room,
put back the curtains, and
discovered
the features of
the inhuman Creditor.We
paused
.He
endeavoured
to turn his face from us, and waving his hand
for us to leave him, cried emphatically, Heartfree!
thou art revenged.
I
should
like to know,
said
Heartfree, when his
wounded
guest
was able to leave his apartment, by
what accident you came in that dangerous
situation
.
I will inform you, he replied:About three
weeks
since
, my
house
was
consumed
by fire, and
with it all my propertymy wife and children were
saved
, but they were
saved
from the flames to
perish
by famine.
His heart was full.Heartfree
passed
his hand
across
his eyes.The man continued.Some
charitable
people made a collection of near fifty pounds,
and
advised
me to go into the country, and
purchase
a little place where my wife and children might be
supported
by
industry
.To
save
expences I travelled
on foot, and in a late
tempest
stopt
at an ale
house
till
it
should
be over. On coming away, two men
offered
to accompany me; but before I had proceeded
far, they
stopped
and demanded my money;
seeing
they had no fire arms, I endeavoured to defend
myself
,
but they were too powerful; I received a wound
in my
side
and
soon
grew
insensible
; the
rest
you
know.I return you many thanks for the
unmerited
favours I have received; but I
must
now go
back to my poor family, and either
starve
in
obscurity
,
or go to the
parish
.
You
shall
do neither, exclaimed Heartfree,
looking
at his own children as he
spoke
.
Heartfree was a
husband
and a father in the
just
sense
of the words.He was troubled with a
short
memory, and had entirely forgot that he had ever
been
harshly
treated by the
person
before him.
You
shall
do neither,
said
he, taking out his
pocket
book, and endeavouring to
disperse
the drops of
humanity that
started
in his eye: here, giving him
a note, here is a trifle; I do not at
present
want;
when you can
spare
it, repay me; till then you are
welcome.
The man could not take it
astonishment
had
rendered him
motionless
.
Heartfree put it on the table, and calling to a
servant
to get a
horse
ready for his
guest
to return to
town,
wished
him a
pleasant
ride, and left the room.
The ELOPEMENT.
I fear
this
step
will greatly
distress
my poor
father,
said
Melissa
to her woman, as they entered
the Park.
They had left the carriage at Spring Gardens,
with orders if they did not return in two hours, to go
home.
Mrs. Tiffany was artful;
she
knew her lady's
partiality for Cogdie, and
she
painted the
matrimonial
D
state
, founded on love, in the
most
glowing
colours
.
Melissa
for a moment forgot her father, but the
idea
soon
returned.
I hope he will not be very wretched,
said
she
.
You will
soon
return,
answered
Mrs. Tiffany.
But I marry without
consulting
him.
And is not your fortune your own, Madam; and
in a
case
of this nature, young ladies can certainly
tell what will contribute to their own
happiness
,
better
than their old fathers can judge for them.
But he will be very angry, TiffanyI will not
goI will return, fall at his feet, and
confess
my
errorI am
sure
he will
refuse
me nothing that is
really
necessary
to my
happiness
.
Dear madam, how can you talk
so
what will
poor Mr. Cogdie think? he will certainly go
distracted
.
Melissa
stopped
.
And then your aunt Sarah,
she
will never let you
have Mr. Cogdie if
she
can prevent it.
No matter; I will not go.
Well, madam,
just
as you
please
; Mr. Cogdie
will think you meant to make a fool of him, and
will marry
Miss
Sparkle, who is
so
fond of him.
Melissa
sighed
and went forward.
A
chaise
and four was waiting for her at
Hydepark
Corner; I had a
horse
there ready
also
.By
means of my ring I had followed them through the
Park
unseen
I now took it off, and mounting my
horse
, followed the
chaise
full
speed
, in which were
Cogdie,
Melissa
, and her woman.
GRETNA GREEN.
I have
often heard of this place,
said
I, but I
never thought I
should
be one that took a trip to it
on an hymeneal expedition;but I
must
not
lose
sight
of
Melissa
;
so
putting on my ring, I followed
them into the
house
.
The INN.
How
happy your
condescension
makes me,
said
Cogdie, as he
seated
himself
by
Melissa
but I
shall
not be entirely devoid of fear till I can call you mine:
and as the
Parson
is not in the way,
suppose
, my
dear girl, you
sign
this paper, to certify that you
came with me voluntarily, in
case
I
should
be called
to an account for running away with an
Heiress
.
May I not read the paper,
said
Melissa
.
It is of no great
consequence
, my love, whether
you
sign
it or not, only in
such
cases
there are
sometimes
difficulties
ensue
after the ceremony is over.
I may be tried and
cast
.
Give me the paper, I will
sign
it.
I trembled with anxiety.She had taken up the
pen to
sign
the conveyance of her whole fortune
into
his hands.
I will
see
himexclaimed a voice, not the
gentlest
in the worldI have a warrant to apprehend
him.
Cogdie turned pale as
ashes
.The pen dropped
from
Melissa
's hand.
An officer of
justice
entered.
Mr. Cogdie,
said
he, you
must
go with me.
I
arrest
you for a fraud committed five years ago.
And who has employod you? who forged this tale
to injure me in the opinion of this lady?
I had taken off my ring, and
stepping
forward at
that moment, cried, 'tis I, you villain. Is it not
enough that you have ruined an innocent girl who
was under my protection; left her and her
helpless
infant to
shame
and want, and by
base
and
fraudulent
methods taken from me near a
thousand
pounds,
but you
must
add to the catalogue of your crimes the
ruin of this amiable lady, and break the heart of her
worthy father.
Melissa
shrieked
, and fainted; I caught her as
she
fell, and bore her in my arms to another
apartment
.Cogdie
departed with the officers of
justice
,
muttering
curses
as he went.
O! where am I, cried
Melissa
, as
she
opened her
eyes, and where is my dear father? Safe, I hope,
replied
I; and when you
choose
, I will order a
chaise
and we will return to him.
When you
please
, Sir; but I fear he will never
see
me, never forgive me; I dare not go to him.
I will make your peace with him,
said
I.
Melissa
burst
into tears, and was
silent
.
We cannot depart without
some
refreshment
,
thought I;
so
going into the kitchen to order
something
,
I met Mrs. Tiffany on the
stairs
. Woman,
said
I, what wages does your lady owe you?
Six months, Sir; but I hope my lady will not
part with me in this
strange
place?
You had no
business
to
advise
her to come to this
strange
placethere is your money, and three
guineas
to pay your expences to town, your lady never
desires
to
see
you again.Now by the
astonishment
of her countenance, and a
sort
of leer that
she
gave
as
she
tripped down
stairs
, I
guessed
I had paid her
more than was her due.
HONESTY.
This
Woman has certainly got more than
she
had a right to,
said
I,
standing
with my right hand
on the top of the lower
balustrade
, and holding my
purse
, which I had not yet tied up, in my leftThe
world talks much about
honesty
, but I cannot
comprehend
where it is to be found.The trader will
stand
behind his counter, and
ask
you three
shillings
per yard for cloth more than it is worth, and if you
are inexperienced, as it frequently happens in
such
cases
, you pay him without
hesitation
he knows
he has
imposed
upon you, yet he will lay his hand
upon his heart, and declare he is an
honest
man.
The CourtierOh! quoth reflection, pray don't
mention a courtier and
honesty
in the
same
breath.
The womenhow can you talk of their
honesty
,
when you have
so
flagrant a proof to the contrary
before you.The Clergy
worse
and
worse
; does
not the beneficed clergyman, quietly pocket his
hundreds
,
or
thousands
, while the poor curate is
starving
on thirty pounds per annum, and will not the rector
preach you an eloquent
sermon
on charity, and the
curate
spend
his breath in recommending
abstinence
.
Is this
honesty
?
It may be called
so
,
said
I.
The lawyer and
physician
Oh, there is no
honesty
there, I
assure
you; the one
steals
your
fortune
,
and the other your lifebut this is all in the
way of
business
.
Then pray where may we find this
said
honesty
?
It was a
sort
of
question
I knew not how to
answer
at
that
instant
faithful C
sar
came and licked
my hand.You are right,
said
I, patting his head.
If any thing like
honesty
or fidelity is to be found
in the world, it is in your
species
.
Shall we go, Sir,
said
Melissa
, as
she
came down
stairs
.
With all my heart,
said
I, putting up my
purse
,
and offering her my hand.The
chaise
was at the
door, and I was actually
stopping
in to it, without
once recollecting that I had not
spent
a
single
half-penny
for the good of the
house
.
D 2
The RECITAL.
It
is all like a dream,
said
Melissa
, as the
chaise
drove off; a
sort
of
confused
,
disagreeable
dream,
from which I
shall
be glad to awakebut pray, Sir,
if it be not
troublesome
, will you tell me the
meaning
of
some
words which you dropped concerning
Cogdie? what woman has he ruined, and whom
has he defrauded?
I will tell you, Madam,
said
I
she
was all
attention
.
Five years
since
, a friend of mine died and left
a lovely orphan daughter to my care.Olivia was
young and inexperienced in the ways of the world.
I was gay and fond of companythe
house
of a
young gentleman of fortune is not a fit
sanctuary
for
innocence and beauty. I loved Olivia like a
sister
I would have revenged an
insult
offered her at the
expense
of my life, but
she
required the tender
solicitude
of a mother, the
sedate
mature advice of a
father
.Her
heart was the
seat
of
sensibility
,
she
was
formed for
domestic
love and felicityhaving no
paternal
ties, no filial affection to warm her gentle
breast
there was an aching void in her heart,
which only love could fill.Cogdie
visited
at my
house
he was much older than Olivia,
she
was
only
sixteen
.He was attentive to her
childish
pleasures
;
her favourite dog was
caressed
he would
feed her Goldfinch, talk to her parrot, and bring her
nosegays
.I was not of a
suspicious
temper, but
placed an implicit confidence in Cogdie, who, by a
thousand
arts, had ingratiated
himself
into my favour.
It was not long before I
observed
Olivia grew pale
and thin;
she
had
lost
her
chearfulness
, and I
frequently
found her in tears. Imagining
she
might
be
solitary
for want of a female companion, I
proposed
her going into the country to an old lady, a
friend of mine, who had a daughter but three years
older than
herself
she
consented
, and two days after
was appointed for her departure. When the
appointed
morning came,
she
was not to be found. I
sent
to all her acquaintance in vain.I cannot
describe
my
distress
I told my affliction to Cogdie;
he
consoled
me, and flattered me with hopes I might
yet find herI was happy to think I had
such
a
friend. Three weeks
passed
on, and I never heard
of my OliviaCogdie had frequently mentioned his
being
sometimes
employed by a capital merchant at
Hamburgh, with whom I was acquainted when
abroad
He came to me one morning and
shewed
a letter in which he was
desired
to
send
the merchant
a ring, the
most
valuable that could be procured.
I wonder,
said
Cogdie, why he has not
sent
me the
money to
purchase
this ring; he knows my
circumstances
are not the
most
affluent. He
seemed
distressed
at not being able to get
so
valuable a ring on
credit.I
sent
him to my jeweller; the ring was
ordered, and it came to near eight hundred and fifty
poundshe took it away in
haste
one morning,
as he
said
, to
send
it to Hamburgh; and I never
saw
him again, till a few days
since
, when I was
informed
he was one of the
most
noted gamblers about
town. I had given up all thoughts of ever
finding
Olivia, when going out one evening
The TRAVELLER.
The
roads are very heavy indeed,
said
I,
breaking
the thread of my
story
, and fixing my eyes on
an old man, who was travelling through the dirt
There had
just
fallen a heavy
shower
of rain, and
the
sun
was now
shining
with
scorching
rays upon
his head; he was
dressed
in a gray coat, and a
bundle
hung to the end of a
stick
that was
across
his
shoulder
.My
heart is always
interested
by the
present
object.This man,
said
I, is no more able to walk
than I am; and four
horses
can certainly drag three
peopleI bade the
postilion
stop
.And what are
you about to do?
said
PrudenceOffer that poor
man a
seat
in the
chaise
,
said
Benevolenceah! but
you know nothing of him; he may be a thief, cried
Suspicion
or a very poor mechanic, and by no
means fit to ride in a
chaise
with a gentleman, urged
Pridebut he is a fellow-creature, and
seems
very
weary,
said
Humanity.I
stayed
not another
moment
for
consideration
.
And have you never heard of Olivia
since
?
said
Melissa
, when we were
settled
in our
seats
.I
know not how it was, but I could not proceed with
my
story
there was
something
in the appearance
of the old man, that awakened my
curiosity
he
was a figure not
striking
; but examine it minutely,
and you would find it
interesting
. A few gray hairs
were
scattered
over his forehead; his face
seemed
to
have
some
traces of
sorrow
and
disappointment
;
his features were grave, but withal tempered with
such
meek
resignation
and
composure
, that I
contemplated
them till I had forgot Olivia,
Melissa
, and
almost
myself
.
The CONJECTURE.
There
is
such
a natural
curiosity
implanted in
the mind of man, that we cannot be half an hour in
company with a
stranger
, before in our own
imagination
we form many conjectures concerning his
situation
in lifewhat
sort
of a
disposition
he has
whether he is married or
single
and fifty
such
particulars
,
which are of no real
consequence
to us.I
had not been
seated
with this old man above ten
minutes
,
when I had
settled
in my own mind that he
was a
parson
, that he had
lost
his wife, and that he
was going to town in order to look out for
some
employment
to
settle
his children in.Thou
hast
lost
thy partner, thought I, looking at him with
compassion
who has heightened the
pleasure
of thy youth,
shared
with thee the
sweets
and bitters of life, and
was thy companion in old age.The bower that
she
planted
so
many years
since
; the woodbines that
she
trimmed and guided with her hands, now
shoot
wild
and neglected, and that bower which to thee was
once a
paradise
, is now
desolate
and gloomy,
deprived
of her
presence
.What a fancy baggage is this
Madam Fancy,
said
I, recollecting
myself
;
she
has given me a pain at my heart by telling me
a tale which, perhaps, has no foundation.
Do not complain of Fancy,
said
my fellow
traveller, for how many a heavy hour
she
often helps
to
dissipate
, when
she
soars
upon the pinions of hope,
and builds fine airy fabrics, extricates us out of
difficulties
,
and leads us to the
summit
of our
wishes
;
and we are for the moment as happy as tho' in the
real
possession
of them; and what tho
she
sometimes
does
forsake
us, and all the
prospects
vanish
into
air, yet
soon
she
returns again, and again is
welcomed
we
listen
to her
siren
tale with
pleasure
, and
so
wear life away. How often in fancy have I
rushed
into battle, and with this arm
sent
hundreds to
eternity
how
often has fancy led me to my
sovereign
's
feet to receive the reward of my
past
services
.
You are a
soldier
, then,
said
, I,every feature
was animated with the remembrance of former
campaigns
,
as he replied in the affirmative.
Then by my
soul
,
said
I madam Fancy is an
arrant
cheat, for
she
had
represented
you as a
parson
.
The SOLDIER.
I have
spent
the
best
part of my life,
said
the
old man, in the
service
of my country.At fifty
years of age I retired, with no other fortune than a
lieutenant's half payit was but
scanty
, it was but
sufficient
for the wants of
Narcissa
, my wife, and
self
.I would tell you that my child was lovely, Sir,
but I am old, and a father; both
those
particulars
would lead you to doubt my veracity. Our
mansion
was
small
, but it was the
mansion
of content.
Last
summer
an old lady came to lodge in our
neighbourhood
;
she
took great notice of
Narcissa
during her
residence
in the country, and at her departure
requested
me to let my child come the
ensuing
spring
to
pass
a few weeks in town; with reluctance I
consented
, for I thought the fair
blossom
of innocence
would be
subject
to contamination if I
entrusted
her
in the metropolis without a proper protector.
You was right,
said
Iat that
instant
recollecting
poor Olivia, and fearing I might again
lose
the
thread of my
story
, I
instantly
gratified
Melissa
's
curiosity
,
by relating the remainder.
The recital continued.
Going
out one evening, I heard a voice which
I thought I knew, imploring charity. I
sent
my
servant
to bring her to me;
she
came weeping and
sobbing
aloud.She
just
entered the door, and
sunk
insensible
at my
seet
.It was poor OliviaI
raised
her, I
pressed
her in my arms, and by the
tenderest
caresses
called her back to life. When
she
found
herself
in my arms,
she
could hardly
trust
her
senses
,
but
sliding
from my embrace upon her knees, took
both my hands in hers, and cried will you forgive
me.I
assured
her
she
was pardoned;
soothed
her and begged to know why
she
had left my
protection
she
unfolded a tale of horrorCogdie had
ruined her. She found
herself
pregnant, and
pressed
him to marry her; he
said
I would not confent to
their union, and when out of
tenderness
I
wished
to
remove her into the country,
she
thought it was
only
to take her from him.
Conscious
of her own
unhappy
situation
,
she
flew to her betrayerhe for a
while behaved with a tolerable degree of
tenderness
;
but he
soon
threw off the
disguise
, and turned her out
of doors, at the
same
time informing her that I had
taken an oath never to
see
or
assist
her.
Heavens! what barbarity, exclaimed
Melissa
.
Melissa
pitied Olivia, but
she
felt for
herself
it
might have been her
situation
.She
desired
me to
proceed.
I took the fair mourner,
said
I, into the country,
where, in about
six
weeks,
she
was delivered of a
boy.I told her unfortunate tale to Mrs Sidley and
her daughter; they pitied her, they determined
she
should
not be
lost
. I
visited
Olivia in her retreat;
my
visits
were long and frequent; when I was
absent
from Sidley Cot, I was
pensive
and unhappy;
my former
pleasures
lost
the power of
amusing
in
short
, I at
last
discovered
that the lovely Emma
Sidley
had taken
possession
of my heart; I
sought
her
handI gained it, and brought my charming prize
triumphant up to town.
Olivia has
spent
these
last
five years in
superintending
the care of her boy;
she
passes
for a widow,
and her charms have gained her many admirers, but
she
declines them all; and declares
she
looks upon
herself
as the wife of Cogdie. Chance
discovered
to
me his vile
design
on you. Pardon me, dear lady,
if I thought the method I have made
use
of, the only
one that I could
impress
your mind with terror, at
the precipice you have
escaped
, and guard you in
future
against
forming
clandestine
connections with
our
sex
.
The OMISSION.
And
what have you done with the old lieutenant?
said
my Emma, when I had given her an account of
our journey.
I
set
him down
somewhere
in the Strand,
said
I.
I hope you found
some
opportunity to
increase
his little
store
, without hurting his feelings,
said
she
.
I was
ashamed
to own my
omission
; and yet
where is the
shame
?
said
I, as I
sat
with my hand
upon my Emma's knee, reading the
sweet
lines
written
by benevolence on her lovely countenance.
Where is the
shame
that I was guilty of an
omission
through
forgetfulness
? it was not a wilful
sin
against
charityI will go
seek
him,
said
I, and repair my
fault.
You will
first
go to my father, I hope,
said
Melissa
.
I took my hat, and
stood
full two minutes
undetermined
which to do
first
they were both actions
of benevolence.
Had it been thy
case
, bright pattern of humanity,
said
I, opening a volume of Sterne, that lay on the
table before me,
just
at the corporal's relating the
story
of Le Fevre to Captain Shandyhad it been
thy
case
, thou would'
st
have given the preference to
the old
soldier
; but I am a father, and will act as
my feelings direct.
The RECONCILIATION.
It
is of no
purpose
,
said
I, to the
servant
, to
deny
your
master
; I am
sure
he is at home, and I
will
see
himpray tell him I have particular
business
with him.I had left
Melissa
at my
house
after waiting half an hour, I was admitted up
stairs
Melissa
's father was
sitting
in a
pensive
posture
, his
looks dejected, and his
dress
disordered
.On the
other
side
of the room
sat
a woman, the picture of
envy and ill-nature.
You will pardon me, Sir, for this
intrusion
I
came from
My daughter, eagerly exclaimed the old
gentleman
and
where is
she
, Sir?will
she
come home
again? Oh, lead me to her, that I may lock her in
my arms, and with tears of joy
wash
away the
remembrance
of her error.
I
suppose
Miss
is married, cried Mrs. Sarah.
She did not make
such
an
excursion
, and with
such
company, for nothing.
Really, Madam,
said
I,
she
is not married;
she
has taken a little
excursion
it is true, but
she
is now
at my
house
, impatiently waiting for a
summons
to
throw
herself
at her father's feet, and implore his
forgiveness
.The old gentleman called for his
hat.
Why
surely
you will not forgive her, brother?
said
the
churlish
aunt.
Not forgive her! exclaimed the fatherI tell
you,
sister
,
she
shall
be forgiven, taken again to my
bosom
, again
share
my confidence; nor be driven
by my
unkindness
, and the cold contempt of her
own
sex
to that vice which I know her
soul
would
shrink
from as from death.
Mrs. Sarah muttered
something
about virtue and
propriety, and left the room.
There were three
reasons
why Mrs. Sarah was
so
inveterate
against
her niece; the
first
was was,
she
was old, very
sallow
rather inclined to be crooked,
and had a voice
something
resembling
the cawing of
a rook; it was therefore a great mortification to
have a niece
so
young and lovely.
In the
second
place,
she
had formed
some
design
E
on Cogdie's heart
herself
no woman can bear a
rival in love or
dress
.
The third, and
most
potent
reason
was,
she
had
never been a parent, therefore could not tell the
pangs, the yearnings, the fond
solicitudes
that by
turns agitated the heart of
Melissa
's father.
Come, let us go, my friend,
said
he, let us go and
bring the dear fugitive home.
As we were going, I gave him an account of our
expedition.
I cannot bear to
see
him, exclaimed
Melissa
,
hiding
her face as we enteredHe would not
suffer
her
to kneel, but embracing her cordially, cried, Come
home, my child, come home, and let us forget all
that is
past
, I never will reproach you.
He was right in making this
promise
, for nothing
is
so
liable to drive a woman to a
second
error, as
her being
subject
to continual reproach for the
first
.
I wonder, thought I, as they departed, if there is
a geater
blessing
on this
side
eternity, than the power
of conferring benefits.The man who has it in his
power to make others happy, has a large
share
of
happiness
allotted to
himself
.I would not part
with my ring
said
I for half the
universe
; without
it I had been unable to deliver this charming girl
from the hands of her betrayer.
The PRINTING OFFICE.
And
can that young creature be an author?
said
I
she
was
standing
at the door of the printing office,
waiting for
admission
.I had rambled out that
morning in
search
of adventuresmy ring was on,
I entered the office with the young author.
I have brought you my
manuscript
, Mr. Cke,
said
she
; the
story
is founded on fact, and, I hope,
will be
so
lucky as to
please
those
who
shall
hereafter
peruse
it.
Is it original,
Miss
?
Entirely
so
.
Lord
bless
me! that was quite
unnecessary
.
Why, Sir, how could I think of offering to the
public a
story
which has appeared in print before?
Nothing more common, I
assure
you.
He was a thin, pale looking man,
dressed
in a
shabby
green coathe never looked in her face the
whole time; he was
speaking
, but
standing
half
sideways
towards her, fixed his eyes
askance
upon the
ground.I never like a man that is
ashamed
to look
me in the face, it argues a
consciousness
of not
having
always acted with integrity.
Nothing can be more common,
Miss
, continued
he, than for an author to get a quantity of old
magazines
,
the older the better, and having picked and
culled
those
stories
the
most
adapted for his
purpose
,
he places them in a little regular order, writes a line
here and there, and
so
offers them to the public as
an entire new work.
See, here, now, I have
published
this work on my
own account;
these
few
first
pages are original, but
I
assure
you the
scissars
did the
rest
. I have entitled
it The
Moralist
, and
sell
these
two volumes at
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
.
I
should
rather call that compiling,
said
the young
author.
Why
so
it is, in factbut I
assure
you there are
few people who have genius
sufficient
to write a book,
or even if they had, would take the trouble to do it.
A
sentimental
novel will hardly pay you for time
and paper.A
story
full of intrigue, wrote with
levity
,
and tending to convey
loose
ideas, would
sell
very well.
It is a
subject
unfit for a female pen,
said
the
young lady.
Why you need not put your name to it.
It is a
subject
unfit for any pen, retorted
she
, a
deep vermilion dying her cheeks, and fire
flashing
from her eyes
she
stopped
, and checked her
rising
passion
I think, Sir,
she
continued, with more
composure
, the
person
who would write a book that
might tend to corrupt the morals of youth, and fill
their docile minds with ideas pernicious and
destructive
to their
happiness
,
deserves
a greater
punishment
than the robber who
steals
your
purse
, or the
murderer that takes your life.
Mr. Cke
stared
it was a vacant
stare
he
wondered, no doubt, how an author could
study
any
thing but her own emolumentI was
pleased
with
her
sentiments
if your writings are equal to what
you have
just
uttered,
said
I, they will be worth
perusing
;
but
some
can talk better than they write;
perhaps it is her
case
. Her works never fell in my
way,
so
I cannot judge.
You mean to
publish
by
subscription
,
said
Mr.
CkeShe replied in the affirmative
And how do you mean to get
subscribers
?
By
shewing
my
proposals
, and
simply
requesting
them to encourage my undertakings.
Oh! God
bless
me, he replied,
still
looking
askance
,
for he never changed his
position
, or
raised
his
eyes from the ground, except it was to look at his
elbow, and contemplate his thread-bare
sleeve
It
will never do to go that way to workyou
must
have
a tale of
distress
to tell, or you will never procure one
subscriber
I am not very much
distressed
,
said
she
; and if I
was, why
should
I blazon it to the world?
It is no matter whether you are really
distressed
or
not,
said
Cke; but you
must
tell a tale to excite
pity, or you will never gain a
single
shilling
towards
printing your booksI have
sold
eight hundred
copies
of the
Moralist
by
these
meansnobody gives
themselves
the trouble to enquire whether my
story
be
false
or true; it excites pity for the moment
they
send
me a
subscription
my
purpose
is
answered
,
and 'tis a
question
whether they ever think of me
or my
story
again
She
seemed
tired of the
conversation
so
laying
down her
manuscript
, and
desiring
him to put it
in hand immediately,
she
bade him good morning
What
impositions
there are in the world!
said
I,
as I went out of the office: this very account will
make me always
resuse
to
subscribe
to a book that is
recommended by a tale of
distress
.
The FUNERAL.
Two
coaches with white plumes; in the
first
was the
cossin
of an infant at the door of an elegant
house
stood
several
domestics
weepingA young
woman
who had
stood
at a
distance
, watched the
coaches
till they were out of
sight
and then
burst
into
tears
I removed my ring from my finger, and inquired
the
cause
of her grief.
He is gone, Sir,
said
she
, pointing to the road the
coaches had taken; he is gone, and I
shall
never fee
him again; he was the
sweetest
childI once lived
with him, I loved him with
unspeakable
tenderness
,
listened
with
pleasure
to his prattle, and when he
was ill, attended him with anxious, unremitting care;
he was the delight of his parents, he was the joy of
my heart.
You do wrong to lament,
said
I; he is gone to a
more happy place; he is taken away before he had
offended his Maker, to
share
in
pleasures
unspeakable
and
unceasing
; then why
should
you make
yourself
wretched? It is like regretting that he was not
E 2
suffered
to remain in a world
subject
to all
sorts
of
disappointments
and
missortunes
; he is now an
angel
in the
mansions
of the
blessed
: why
should
you
then mourn his
absence
from you?
Have you children, Sir?
said
she
, with unaffected
simplicity
The
question
struck
me forcibly. I
thus
asked
my own hearthad Harriet been taken
from me, could I have
reasoned
thus calmly; the
very
supposition
gave me an
unspeakable
pang; it
told me that
reason
had little power over the heart
torn by the
loss
of what it prized more than life.
I turned to the young woman
she
was gone a few
paces from me
she
sighed
, profoundly pronounced
the name of Henry, wiped off her tears,
raised
her
swollen
eyes to Heaven and criedThy will be
done.
I was
ashamed
of my former
reasoning
; that one
sentence
convinced me, that
christianity
was a
better
comforter in affliction than the
most
boasted
rules
of
philosophy
.
The HAPPY PAIR.
It
was a neat little
house
, by the
side
of the fields
a pretty looking woman,
drest
by
simplicity
,
Nature's
handmaid, was laying the table cloth and
trimming up her little parlour; her looks were
chearful and
serene
, and with a voice
pleasing
, though
wild and untutored,
she
sung
the following little
stanzas
:
Here, beneath my humble cot,
Tranquil peace and
pleasure
dwell;
If contented with our lot,
Smiling joy can grace a cell.
Nature's wants are all
supply
'd;
Food and raiment,
house
and fire;
Let others
swell
the courts of pride,
This is all that I require.
Just
as
she
had
finished
, a genteel young man
entered
the gate;
she
ran eagerly to meet him.
My dear Charles,
she
cried, you are late to-night.
It was near ten o'clockI had taken the advantage
of my ring, and followed them into the
house
.
I am weary,
Betsey
,
said
he, leaning his head
upon
her
shoulder
.
I am
sorry
for it, my love; but come, eat your
supper
, and you
shall
then
repose
on my
bosom
, and
hush
all your cares to
rest
Their frugal meal was
sallad
and bread and
butter
.
If to be content is to be happy, my dear,
said
she
how
superlatively
happy am II have no
wish
beyond
what our little income will afford me; my
home is to me a palace, thy love my
estate
. I envy
not the rich dames who
shine
in
costly
array; I
please
my Charles in my plain,
simple
attire; I
wish
to
please
no other.
Thou dear reward of all my toils! cried Charles,
embracing her, how can I have a
wish
ungratified
while
possessed
of theeI never
desired
wealth but
for thy
sake
, and thy chearful, contented
disposition
makes even wealth
unnecessary
.
It is by no means
necessary
to
happiness
,
said
I,
as I left the
house
Charles and
Betsy
seem
perfectly
happy and content with only a bare
competence
I
ask
but a competence, cries the luxurious
or avaricious wretch; the very exclamation
convinces
us, that a
trisle
is adequate to the wants of
the humble, frugal mind, while
thousands
cannot
supply
the inordinate
desires
of the prodigal, or
fatisfy
the
grasping
disposition
of the
miser
.
The DRUNKARD.
It
was a
confused
noise
of
singing
,
swearing
, and
a
crash
of breaking
glasses
.Perhaps,
said
I, this is
a private mad
house
; for
surely
I am not near
Bedlam
.
The moon
shone
bright, I
cast
my eyes up
towards the
house
and perceived the
sign
of the
Angel
Good
Heavens! thought I, this is a public
house
; and how ridiculous to place an angel at the
door of the habitation of
drunkenness
and
debauchery
.
Of all the crimes to which human nature is
addicted
,
drunkenness
is the
most
pernicious; it is the
master
key that leads to all other vice.Behold that
young man; he is an apprenticein a
sit
of
intoxication
he commenced an acquaintance with a lewd
woman; he has not money to
answer
her
extravagancies
he
robs his
master
he is detectedhis
distracted
parents pay the
sum
he has takenthey
exhort him with
streaming
eyes, to avoid
such
excesses
in futureHe leaves them with a
promise
of amendmentReturning to his
master
's
house
,
he again is entrapped in his darling vice, and again
returns to his abandoned companionbehold him
now
just
entering her
mansion
he has taken a
confiderable
sum
from his
master
's tillthe officers of
justice
are
close
behindhe intreats her to
secrete
him
she
refuses
she
delivers him up; denies her
acquaintance with himhe is dragged to
prison
.
See him now, loaded with irons, in a
dismal
dungeon
;
he has received the
sentence
of deathHis
parents enter; they are
speechless
with
sorrow
he
remembers their former
kindness
he
sees
their
present
anguish
; his folly, his guilt appear in their
proper colourshe would comfort them, but is
unable
the
messenger
of death callsanother
moment
,
he
asks
but one moment, and that is
denied
his
mother
But
stop
; the
scene
grows too deep; I
must
draw
a veil before it.
The BUCKS.
And
these
men call
themselves
rational beings
they had interrupted my meditations by breaking the
lamps and beating the watchmen who had
endeavoured
to prevent them. Among them was a young
man of qualityOh,
shame
,
said
I, that
those
whose
exalted
station
makes their action
conspicuous
in the
eyes of the world,
should
set
examples
so
very
detrimental
to
society
.
Dn me,
says
he, let us go and get drunk, and
then roar catches through the
street
, and
disturb
the
sober
,
sleeping
drones, in
spite
of all the watchmen
or
constables
in the kingdomCome along, my
boys; and if we do go to the round
house
, let us go
jovially.
How very humiliating it is to human nature to
see
mankind
so
far degrade
themselves
, and commit
such
follies as render them
scarcely
a degree
superior
to
the brute creationnay, I do not know but the poor
ass
, who carries the loaded panier, or the ox who
drags the plough, are more
useful
to
society
that
such
a man:
these
poor animals render their owners all
the
service
in their power in return for their food,
while the buck
spends
his nights in riot and
debauchery
;
his days in
sleep
, and, in return for the
vast
blessings
showered
around him,
instead
of
making
himself
serviceable
to the community of which
he is a member, he breaks the laws,
disturbs
the
peace,
squanders
his
substance
on the infamous and
profligate, and dies without having performed one
action that might make his
loss
regretted.
You
thoughtless
,
dissipated
rakes that haunt this
town, behold this
comparison
, and if you are men,
blush
at your own inferiority.
The MIDNIGHT HOUR.
The
clock
struck
twelve.
This is the hour,
said
I, when Morpheus, with
his
drowsing
poppies, has
sealed
the eyes of the
innocent
and happybut Morphcus is a courtier; he
never
visits
the couch of affliction, or
listens
to the
request
of the unhappy.Now the lover, true to the
appointed hour, to elude the guardian's watchful eye,
steals
softly
to the window of his fair
enslaver
, who
anxiously
had counted the lazy, lagging minutes, and
listened
to the
passing
breeze that moved the flowers
or
whispered
through the wood; caught at each
sound
, and thought it was her love. Now the fair
mourner
seeks
her widowed bed, and hangs over her
sleeping
infant, till
busy
fancy recalls to her mind
the father's featuresthe tear of regret which trickles
from her eye falls on the infant's cheekHe wakes,
he
smiles
, and charms away her
sorrows
.So,
from the lowering
sky
, when the
soft
shower
gently
descends
on the half blown
rose
, its fragrance is
increased
,
its leaves expanded, and all its beauties are
revealed to view.
At this lonely hour the ruffian takes his knife,
and
rushes
on the unguarded victim of his barbarity.
Thou
foolish
wretch, think not the
sable
curtain
of the night can hide thy actions from the eye of
justice
.
This is the hour when the guilty mortal, though
in a
losty
room,
stretched
on a bed of down, and
covered
by a gilded canopy, though, perhaps, on India's
distant
shore
he perpotrated the horrid deed;
imbrued
his hands in innocent blood to
grasp
a glittering
toy,
starts
frantic from his pillowhe
sees
the
murdered
Indian, his gaping wounds, his mangled
carcase
;
he hears his wife and children calling aloud
for vengeance on the murderer; the cold
sweat
bedews
his limbs, his joints tremble, his faculties are
lost
, he groans, and in his thoughts,
curses
the day
when he was
first
taught the
use
of gold or the
advantages
of power.
This is the hour
In which, cries reflection, your Emma is
wondering
why you tarry
so
long from her; and, anxious
for your
safety
, paints to her
sickening
imagination
a
thousand
dangers which
exist
not but in her ideas.
I quickened my pace
She met me at the door
I caught her in my arms
A tear had fallen upon her cheek, another
stood
glittering in her eyethe
first
was a tear of
suspense
,
the
last
of joy. I
kissed
them both away, and was
angry with
myself
for having given her gentle
bosom
a moment's pain.
The LOUNGER.
Heigho
! cried he,
stretching
and yawning;
how
shall
I
pass
this day?
It was nine o'clock; he was
just
up, and had
repaired
to the coffee
house
for his
breakfast
. He took
he news paper, read two or three
advertisements
;
but
soon
threw it
aside
, and
seemed
wholly occupied
in picking his nails and
whistling
. I will follow
you through this day,
said
I, and immediately put
on my ring. He left the coffee
house
and
sauntered
an hour in the park, than
strolled
from one
acquaintance's
house
to another, till he received an
invitation
to dinnerThat
universal
topic, the
weather
,
being
discussed
, and the play for the night
mentioned
,
he had not another word to
say
, but
sat
stupidly
silent
,
unless
indeed he ventured to
say
yes or no to any
question
asked
by the lady of the
house
.
He once complained of the
heaviness
of time
she
recommended drawingthat required too much
study
readinghe could not bear a book, it
stupified
him
music
he
should
never have patience to
learn; he liked nothing but the flute, and that would
throw him into a
consumption
I am
surprised
,
said
the lady, you like none of
these
; give me leave to recommend you a few books
that I am
sure
will help to wear away the time
Bridon's Tour you will find
instructive
and
amusing
Goldsmith
's Animated Nature is the
same
Sterne is a
pleasing
author; and there is a
vast
fund
of
amusement
in
You have mentioned books enow already,
said
he
(interrupting her) to
last
me my life. I never read
any thing except it be a ballad, or the
last
dying
speech
of people that were hanged.
Very entertaining and
instructive
subjects
, cried
the lady.
He dined, and then
sauntered
to a public
house
,
drank a pint of rum and water, went to the play
when it was half over, and came away again
without
understanding
a
single
sentence
he had heard
went again to the public
house
,
squandered
away
two or three
shillings
more in drinking, only
because
he had nothing elfe to do, and went to bed as
he
arose
, with a mind entirely vacant, unoccupied by
thought or reflectionThis is the life of a lounger,
said
IIf the lives of mortals are recorded in the
book of fate, what a blank will this man's life
appear
!Yet
I am certain he
goes to bed every jot as
weary as the poor labourer who toils for his daily
breadIs it the fault of education or
disposition
?
said
I.
Reason
answered
, it
must
be native indolence, or
he would
otherwise
engage in
some
pleasing
study
that might at once employ and
amuse
him
It is a matter of doubt with me whether
such
a
man
deserves
most
our pity or contempt.
A TALE of SCANDAL.
And
so
you are writingand do you intend to
publish
your works?
Perhaps I may,
said
I
What is your
subject
, pray?
Rambles,
excursions
, characters, and tales.
And do you think the world will attend to your
rambles,
excursions
, characters, and tales?
I will write
sentimental
rambles, juvenile
excursions
,
original characters, and tales of
scandal
, and
then my books will be
universally
read.
The
last
article may make them
rise
into
some
repute
,
said
he.
Do'
st
thou know the origin of
scandal
?
said
I.
No
Then I will tell thee
She is of
spurious
birth; begot of Envy on that
blear eyed
monster
,
Mistrust
;
she
was
nursed
by
Self-love, and tutored by
Hypocrisy
She is
hideously
deformed, has a
thousand
ears, and
lists
to every
taleHer eyes magnify the
smallest
objects into
mountains; and as her tongue has not the power to
vent her malicious tales
so
fast
as her vile heart
conceives
them,
she
makes up the
rest
in nods, winks,
shrugs
of the
shoulders
, lifting the eyes, and
shaking
the headShe in general wears a
mask
, and
dresses
in a
pleasing
garb, which makes her
so
well
received
in all companies.
F
Why this is a tale of
scandal
indeed,
said
he.
And the only one I
shall
ever write,
said
Ifor if
in this
vast
globe full of
interesting
scenes
to excite
our wonder and engage our attention, if, I
say
, in
such
a place a man cannot
use
his pen without
stabbing
the character of his neighbour, he
must
have
had a very narrow education, be
possessed
of a bad
heart, and
blessed
with little or no
understanding
.
The VILLAGE WEDDING.
I never
see
the
simple
inhabitants of a village
engaged in a
scene
of mirth, but I long to mingle
with themI
wish
to
see
, feel, and
taste
, every
thing with the
same
sensations
they do.
They were
seated
round a large table, under the
shade
of
some
spreading
oaksI will partake their
diversions
,
said
I, without
disturbing
them;
so
I
put on my ring, and mixed among the groupe.
A nut-brown maid,
dressed
in pure white, the
emblem
of her own innocence,
presided
at the head of
the boardI looked at her with
scrutinizing
eye,
and perceived it was my pretty milk-maidShe had
that day given her hand to Colin, and the chearful
company were
assembled
to keep the wedding.
Their
repast
finished
, a lad with a pipe and
labor
,
and another with a fiddle,
struck
up a lively
air, when Colin and his
Rose
led off the dance, with
step
so
light, a countenance
so
serene
, and an air
so
blythe, that I
wished
myself
an humble villager, and
my Emma a nut-brown maid.
And why cannot all the world live thus? What
need of titles, equipage,
state
, pomp, and
nonsense
?
Nature never
designed
it
so
.
Nor did nature
design
us to wear cloaths
The idea was ludicrousit irritated my
risible
muscles
what
aukward beings would
these
tight country
damsels
appear if they were dancing about in a
state
of nature! A petticoat is a pretty ornament,
said
I
and
so
is an apronThe dancers had tucked
their aprons up on one
side
it gave them a look of
ease
and negligence.
It is
strange
,
said
I, that among all the caprices
of
fashion
the apron has never been totally
abolished
,
but has continued to be worn by all ranks and
degrees
of women, from our grandmother Eve, down
to
these
dancing
damsels
.
It had never
struck
me before that the apron was
an ornament of
such
antiquity.
They danced till
silver
Cynthia lighted up the
horizon
,
and then all with one
consent
sat
down to
supper
.
That
past
, the jocund tale, the
song
, the laugh,
went round, and all was gay
festivity
and mirth.
In the
course
of the evening Colin had twined a
branch of myrtle with woodbine, and placed it on
his
Rose
's
bosom
He could not have judged better;
the woodbine was an emblem of her
sweetness
, the
myrtle of her love and
constancy
.
Farewel,
blest
pair! may your portion of life be
pure, and unmixed with gall; may your
happiness
be as permanent as your innocence and truth are
conspicuous
.
The RESCUE.
I head
been at the play.
A young creature, in the box adjoining that I
sat
in, had attracted my notice the whole evening; her
fixed attention during the performance,
shewed
she
was
almost
a
stranger
to
those
kind of
diversions
.
The various
passions
that agitated her features at
the
interesting
parts of the drama
seemed
the
workings
of pure natureI did not like her companions;
they were by no means
suitable
guardians for her
youth and charms.
The one was a young man of fortune, a
prosessed
libertine.
The other an old, fat woman,
whose
looks and
gestures
bespoke
her employment.
I thought I could read in the open countenance
of the young lady an
unconsciousness
of guilt, and a
full confidence in the company and protection of her
companionsI was determined to be convinced
whether my conjectures were well founded.
When they left the
playhouse
I put on my ring
and followed them; they were
set
down at the door
of an elegant
house
; the rooms within were
superb
,
the furniture grand, and the
servants
numerous
Supper was
served
upthey urged the young lady to
drink
several
glasses
of wine
She complied with reluctance.
I will go and order the coach,
said
the old woman,
and left the room.
The libertine took the opportunity, which was
intentionally
given, and had nearly executed his horrid
purpose
, when taking off my ring and
snatching
up a
knife that lay on the table Villain,
said
I, forbear
your attempts, or this
instant
puts a period to your
lifeHeaven is too watchful over the virtuous to
suffer
it to fall a prey to
such
lust
and barbarity.
If I was clever at
designing
I would give you a
sketch
of this
scene
.
The libertine at the
sound
of my voice
relinquished
his prey, and fixed his eyes on me in
silent
astonishment
,
while every feature
expressed
terror and
dismay
.
Half
starting
from his
seat
, he exclaimed, in a
voice
scarcely
articulate,
Who are you?
The poor girl
sat
leaning her head
against
the
elbow
of the
sopha
, pale and ready to
sink
like a
timid
hart, who for a moment having
outstretched
the
speed
of the fleet hounds, trembling looks around,
and
stops
and pants for breathagain her
pursuers
appear in
sight
again
she
would fly, but fear
deprives
her of the power; tears of
anguish
chase
each
other down her cheeks, and
she
sits
in an agony of
despair
awaiting the approaching ruin which
she
is
unable to
escape
.
I took her by the hand, bid her fear nothing, and
led her triumphant from the
house
of infamy.
The ACTRESS.
I will
take a peep behind the
scenes
,
said
I,
one evening, as I
passed
the Hay-market Theatre;
so
, putting on my ring, I entered.
You
surprise
me, Madamnot come into the
house
about his
business
the nights that you perform?
(
said
a man,
addressing
himself
to
Miss
) pray,
in what has he
molested
you?
He met me on the
stairs
, Sir, and it is very
distressing
to be
jostled
by
such
low creatures. I will
have the
house
cleared of
such
people.
It is a very extraordinary demand, madamhe
is full as
necessary
in his
station
as you are in yours
I fancy, the heroine of a comedy would make
but a poor appearance with her hair uncurled and
unpowdered; nor would you much admire an
hero with a beard of ten or twelve days growth.
I don't
understand
this
insolence
, replied
she
; it
is what I am not
used
to.
Pray, what is all this
fuss
about? cried a lame
gentleman
Nothing in the world, Sir, but
Miss
and the
barber.
F 2
It is very ridiculous,
said
I, talking of the
circumstance
a few days after, that a woman
whose
bread
depends upon the
smiles
of the public, and who,
every
night that the performs, exerts her talents to
please
taylors,
hairdressers
, tinners, nay, even
hairdreers">hairdressers
, tinners, nay, even
chimney-sweepers
,
when they can
raise
a
shilling
to
purchase
a
seat
among the Gods. It is the height of
solly
for
such
a woman to complain of her feelings being hurt
by meeting a barber on her
dressing
-room
stairs
.
Call it by its right name,
said
a
person
that
stood
by me, it is pride.
Pride was not made for man, nor woman neither,
I'll be
sworn
; it
spoils
the
sinest
set
of features in
the world, and is more pernicious to a pretty face
than paint to a lovely complexion;it
sits
but
aukwardly
on a
dutchess
and the queen never
uses
it.
What Queen?
said
he
Why the
British
Queen, to be
sure
,
said
I.
But then you make no
distinction
,
said
he,
between
the
conscious
dignity of a queen, and the pert
supercilious
airs of a favourite
actress
: if the world
were guided by the bright example
set
from the
British
throne, pride would be entirely
abolished
.
That would be a heavenly thing,
said
I; for the
annihilation of pride is like the
dissolution
of the
body
,
it
unsetters
the
soul
, and leaves it free and
unconsined
to
soar
above the
stars
.
I have frequently been engaged in
disputes
concerning
women of this
profession
it puts me
beyond
all patience to hear people advance an opinion
so
very contracted and illiberal, as that of
supposing
no woman can be virtuous who is on the
stage
I
know many at this time who are ornaments not
only
to their
profession
, but to the
sex
in general: even
the lady I have
just
mentioned is generous, humane,
and prudent, pride is her only
sault
.Charming
woman! I have often
said
, when I was enchanted
with her performance of
some
amiable character
conquer but that one foible, and our admiration will
rise
into veneration.I am confident a woman may,
if
she
is
so
inclined, be as virtuous as Lucrece
behind
the
scenes
of a theatre. Virtue begets
respect
wherever
she
appears; on the contrary, a woman of
loose
inclination, though
she
is immured in a
convent
,
will find opportunities of doing evil.It is a
great pity
so
many women belonging to the
stage
are
thus inclined; but why
should
we, on account of
those
that are bad, condemn a Siddons, Brunton,
Kemble, or Pope?Why
should
a woman, if
she
is a good wife, daughter, or mother, be
less
respected
because
she
has genius to contribute to our
amusement
,
by bringing before our eyes heroines we
have
so
often read of, and exhibiting characters we
so
greatl admire?for my part, I never judge of a
person
from their
prosession
or
situation
in life; it
is from their actions I form an idea of their
disposition
;
and as I think genius and merit
deserve
as
much
esteem
when we meet them in an humble
mansion
as when they inherit palaces,
so
are virtue
and prudence as valuable an
acquisition
in an
actress
,
as in the daughter of a peer, and alike to be
esteemed
and
respected
.
The RENCOUNTER.
It
is
astonishing
to me how people can
complain
for want of
amusement
. I am never a
moment
without
something
to
amuse
,
instruct
, or
interest
meI never walk abroad but I am attentive
to every little incident that happens: a
solitary
,
slow
place, the folded arms, or down-
cast
eye, will excite
my
compassion
, and a joyous
serene
aspect
will
exhilirate
my
spirits
even in a
wilderness
where
never
human
step
marked the green turf, or
swept
the
dew drops from the waving
grass
, even there I would
find company,
conversation
, and
amusement
.
To a thinking mind, the book of nature is ever
open for our
perusal
; and a
soul
warmed by
sensibility
and gratitude, reads the divine pages with
pleasure
,
and contemplates the great
source
of all with
wonder, reverence, and love.
As I wandered along, encouraging
these
pleasing
reflections, I
saw
an old man buying
some
stale
bread
and meat at the window of a mean eating-
house
; he
stood
with his back towards me; his coat was
dirty
and torn; his whole appearance was
expressive
of
the
most
abject poverty.Friend,
said
I, going up
to him; perhaps this trifle may procure you a
better
meal, putting half a guinea into his hand.
It always gives my heart a pang when I
see
age
and
distress
combinedage of
itself
always brings
anguish
enough.How very
insupportable
, then,
must
it be, when there are no comforts, no little
indulgencies
,
to
compensate
for
those
days of
unavoidable
pain.
As I
presented
my little donation, I looked in the
old man's faceI thought I had
seen
the features,
but could not recollect where.
Humanity is not entirely
banished
from the world,
said
he, turning part from me to conceal his
emotion
.
I immediately knew his voiceit was the old
lieutenant.Good God!
said
I,
stopping
him as he
was going from me, what has reduced you to this
distressed
situation
?
Misfortune,
said
he.
And did not you know where I lived?
I was
ashamed
to beg,
said
hea
sudden
glow
passing
over his languid featuresand I thought, Sir,
you would be
ashamed
to own an acquaintance with
poverty.
You
shall
go home with me,
said
I, calling an
hackney coachlet
those
take
shame
to
themselves
who deny a part of their wealth to merit in
distress
.
I am proud to acknowledge
myself
the friend of a
man of worth, though he
should
be in the
lowest
situation
.
And why,
said
I, as we drove towards
home, why
should
a man be
ashamed
of his
misfortunes
?
why
should
poverty call a
blush
upon the cheek
of merit? we did not mark out our own fortunes.
But then the world, the world, Sir, will always
scoff
and
spurn
the man humbled by the griping hand
of penury: nor is there an object than in general
meets with more contempt from the rich and
powerful
,
than
those
who have
seen
better days, but are
reduced by unavoidable misfortunes to a dependence
on their
smiles
.
Strange
insatuation
! to
set
themselves
in the pride
of their hearts, above their fellow creatures; and for
what, truly?
because
a little more yellow dirt has
fallen to their
share
. I believe there are but few
who know the true value of riches, and fewer
still
reflect that they are only
stewards
of the wealth
which the bounty of their Creator has committed to
their care; and at
last
, when we all come to give an
account of our
stewardship
, the man who from a
truly
compassionate
nature has wiped the tear from
he eyes of orphans,
softened
the
setters
of the
captive, or cheared the widow, will receive a
greater
reward than the
ostentatious
wretch, who, having
spent
his whole life in
amassing
treasure
, on his
death bed, when he can no longer enjoy it, leaves it
for the endowment of an
hospital
. Such a man is
not charitable from his feelings for others, but an
inordinate
desire
he has to have his own memory
held in veneration.
The REPROOF.
And
do you think there are
such
characters in
the world,
said
the old Lieutenant?
I fear there are too many, friend,
said
I.
I know not how it was,
said
he, but I never
suspected
mankind of half the vices and follies I have
found in this
short
month that I have been in
London
;
and even now I do not think their errors
proceed
half
so
much from the
badness
of their hearts as
their heads. I own, continued he, it is our duty
to render every
service
in our power to our fellow
creatures, but why
should
one,
because
he has a
just
sense
of his duty, and
discharges
it faithfully,
despise
an other
because
he has not the
same
feelings. I
felt a
consciousness
of having, in commending
benevolence
,
founded my own
praise
it was my turn to
be
ashamed
.I felt
abashed
, and
shrunk
, as it were,
into nothing.Oh, man! what a poor weak
creature
thou art, when even in the moment of
discharging
thy duty, thy own heart,
easily
led
astray
, will
vaunt and
boast
its own
superiority
.The
most
benevolent
action in the world
looses
its
intrinsic
merit
,
when the man who performs it
says
to
himself
,
I am better than my neighbour; I am not hard
hearted, nor proud, nor avaricious.
No, cries humility, but you are vain glorious.
I was quite
disconcerted
, and could not forgive
myself
.
The MEETING.
I had
ordered my
servant
to
supply
Mr.
Nelson
(for that was the name of the old Lieutenant) with
every thing
necessary
for him to appear in at dinner,
and then went to
seek
my Emma.I found her in
the gardenthe young lady I had
rescued
last
night
was
busy
in platting a little lock of hair, and placing
it in a fanciful manner, to the bottom of a picture
which hung round her neck. When
she
had
finished
,
she
glanced her eye towards us, and thinking
she
was not
observed
,
pressed
it
several
times to her lips.
I thought I
saw
a tear in her eye, but the
chaste
look,
the religious fervour with which
she
gazed upon the
portrait, convinced me it was a tear
whose
source
might be acknowledged without a
blush
.
She had dropped the picture, and,
resting
one arm
upon a
pedestal
,
seemed
attentively watching
Harriet
and Lucy, who had
dressed
a little favourite dog
in their dolls cloaths, and was teaching it to dance a
minuet.The
scene
was
picturesque
; and I know
not how long I might have contemplated it with
silent
satisfaction
, had I not
observed
Mr.
Nelson
coming toward me with eager
step
and anxious eye.
Tell me, who is that?
said
he, pointing to the
young ladybut that I think 'tis
impossible
, I
should
say
'tis my
Narcissa
.
At the
sound
of his voice the young lady looked up,
and, advancing a few
steps
,
stood
in an attitude of
wonder and
astonishment
, till he pronounced the
name of
Narcissa
; when
springing
like lightning to
him,
she
threw her arms round his neck, and cried,
Yes, yes, I am your child.
It would be doing
injustice
to the
rest
of the
scene
,
were I to attempt to
describe
itwords could not
speak
the feelings of their heartsIt was a meeting
between a fond father and an affectionate childand
I leave it to
such
to judge of their
happiness
.
The REQUEST.
When
we had dined, and the cloth was
removed
Tell
me, my dear Sir,
said
Narcissa
, by what
lucky accident you came acquainted with this
gentleman
,
and what brought you at this time to
London
?
How can you
ask
me that, my child? replied the
old man; did you think your mother and
myself
could
sit
quietly down when you had been
absent
from us near a month, and we had never had a
single
line from you?
I wrote twice a week,
said
Narcissa
, wiping her
eyes
she
could not bear to hear her mother had
been
distressed
.
The old man continued
I was too much
interested
in the
safety
of my dear
girl to be at
ease
under
such
disagreeable
appearances
;
so
leaving your mother what money I could
spare
, I
sat
out to walk to London, but was prevented
by this gentleman.On my arrival in town I went
to the place where the old lady
resided
, and was told
by her
servant
that you were gone out of town to
pass
a few weeksI walked to the place whither I was
directed, but could find no
such
person
My
little
stock
was
almost
exhausted
I went again to the
lady's
house
, and was treated by her
servant
with
insolence
.
Narcissa
laid her hand on his
shoulder
and gave
him a look that I am
sure
would have healed every
wound the
servant
's
insolence
had given his heart,
though they had been a
thousand
.
Oh! filial love, fair daughter of gratitude,
sister
to
piety, thou
first
favourite of Heaven, to whom long
life and
prosperous
days are
promised
, how doth thy
angel's face and
soothing
hand make the paternal
evening of life clear and unclouded!But I am
wandering
from my
story
.
I was now, continued Mr.
Nelson
, reduced to my
last
shilling
, and being a week in arrears for my
lodging, was forced to
sell
my coat, and be content
with an old ragged
surtout
I wrote to the lady two
days
since
, but received no
answer
, and was
almost
driven to
despair
when chance again threw me in
the way of this gentlemanBut how am I to account
for your being here, my child?what was the
cause
of your neglect and
silence
?I think,
Narcissa
if
you had known my anxiety, you would have relieved
it by either coming or writing to me.
NARCISSA.
The
person
to
whose
care you
entrusted
me,
said
Narcissa
was a vile woman; and it is only by
a miracle I can have
escaped
her
snare
I never
knew you was in townI have been whirled about
from one folly to another, and have been
witness
to
such
scenes
of
shame
as made me
shudder
; but I was
told it was
usual
for people of quality to lead a life
of riot, which my vile
preceptress
termed
pleasure
.
A young nobleman paid me particular attention,
talked much of love, and
settlements
, and grandeur,
but never mentioned marriageI was ever on my
guard; nor, indeed, was my heart
prepossessed
in his
favourHis
person
was not
unpleasing
, but his
manner was
disgusting
, his morals corrupt, and his
conversation
unchaste
I had frequently intreated
leave to return to the country; frequently wrote to
you, my dear father,
desiring
to be commanded home
But
last
night,
last
night
She then proceeded to give him an account of
what has been already related to the readerWhen
she
mentioned the villain's attempt upon her honor,
her father looked down to the
side
where his
sword
used

WOMAN.
Who
but a coward indeed, cried I, for who can
look at a woman in all her native
loveliness
,
helpless
,
unarmed, devoid of the
least
defence
against
the
numerous dangers that await her; who that
sees
her
sweet
looks, that
seem
to
speak
in nature's pure
language
behold
I am at your mercy, you are my
protector
,
I am weak and
defenceless
, it is you
must
guard mewho but a barbarian, after having
seen
woman in this light, would attempt to injure or
insult
her. Yet do I
blush
while I
confess
it,
instead
of remembering our duty towards the lovely
sex
, man,
who was
designed
by Heaven as their friend, is
become
their
seducer
; and the fairer the flower, the
more eager are they to
blast
itlike the
scaly
snake
who tries to draw to its devouring jaws the
harmless
bird that
thoughtless
hops from
spray
to
spray
; he
twines about, thews all his glided
scales
,
basks
in the
sun
, rears up his
crested
head, and courts the little
songster
to his
snare
It ventures
first
to gaze at a
distance
on him, then, by degrees draws nearer to
admire, till, facinated by his
subtile
arts, it drops
into
his jaws and meets
destruction
.
Oh! how my heart has often bled to
see
so
many
lovely women, who were intended by nature to be
the
pleasing
bond of
society
, the
source
of virtuous
pleasures
, reduced to the
sad
alternative of
perishing
for want, or living on the wages of
prostitution
.
But oh! woman, when thou
canst
so
far forget what
is due to thy own
sex
as to be
accessary
to the ruin
of the innocent, my heart
swells
with indignation
thou art then like the fallen angel, who, when in
heaven
,
was the
first
among the bright ethereal bodies,
but falling, becomes the
lowest
; and envious of
those
joys which he can never
taste
, exerts his arts,
his malice, and deceit, to draw down others to
the
same
dark
abyss
which he
himself
is plunged
in.

myself

those
poor creatures who are
brought from their native country, and
exposed
to
all the horrors of famine in a place with
whose
customs

I
say
within

I be if I were left in their country without
money or friendsWe can never feel properly the

we place
ourselves
for a few

This man was generally near my habitation, and
I often felt
something
like
curiosity
to know his

ask
him,

I, one day;
perhaps it may lie in my power to make his life a

EAST INDIAN continued.
Poor
fellow!
said
I, looking at him with an
eye of
compassion
as he went out of the apartment
Poor fellow! thou
hast
been hardly
used
by one
man who called
himself
a
Christian
, and it makes
thee
suspect
the whole raceBut,
surely
,
said
I, it is
not a man's barely
prosessing
Christianity
that makes
him worthy that character; a man
must
behave
with humanity, not only to his fellow-creatures, but
to the animal creation, before he can be ranked with
propriety among that exalted
class
of mortals.
The man who with unmerciful hand
scourges
his
slave
, does he then remember that the
person
he is
chastising
is endowed with the
same
sense
of feeling
as
himself
, and is as
sensible
of pain, hunger,
thirst
,
cold, aye, and all the
social
blessings
of life? has
filial, conjugal, and paternal affection?then why,
because
he is a
slave
,
should
you
bestow
on him
painful
stripes
, when
yourself
would
shrink
to receive
but the
smallest
of themDoes the name of Slave,
Slave!
said
I,
rising
as I
spoke
, while the
sanguine
tide that plays about my heart
rushed
unbidden
to my cheeks
Why did I
blush
, why did I tremble, as I
pronounced
the word
slave
?It was
because
I was
ashamed
of the appellationIt is a word that
should
never be
used
between man and manThe negro
on the burning
sands
of Africa was born as free as
him who draws his
first
breath in Britainand
shall
a
Christian
, a man
whose
mind is enlightened by
education and religion, for a little
sordid
pels
,
sell
the
freedom of this poor negro, only
because
he differs
from him in complexionwhat right has an
European
to
sell
an African? do they leave their
native
land and
seek
our
coast
, by arts entice our
countrymen
away, and make them
slaves
?
The SLAVE.
I walked
out and endeavoured to
dissipate
the
disagreeable
reflection; but the idea of
slavery
pursued
me
still
.
Unhappy man,
said
I, as
busy
fancy drew out the
sad
scene
.
She held up to my mind's eye a man born to a good
inheritance, and
surrounded
with all the comforts,
all the
blessings
, he
desired
but he was a negro.
He was
sitting
in his little hut, his jetty
companion
by his
side
; one infant at her
breast
, two others
prattling at her knee;
she
looked,
she
felt happy.
Her
husband
, her children, were with her;
serenity
played on every countenance; content had fixed her
habitation in their dwellingSome Europeans
enter
they
deck his beloved children with baubles
they tie beads round the arms of his wifeand
ornament
her jetty locks with glittering toysHe is
charmed with their
courtesy
He walks with them
to the
sea
side
, and takes his boy, his
eldest
darling,
with himthey invite them on board the
vessel
Poor
soul
!
unsuspecting
their treachery, he goes,
and bids adieu to liberty for everHis wife, taking
advantage of his
absence
, trims up their hutlays
her dear babes to
sleep
and then prepares a
supper
for her love,
composed
of
wholesome
roots and
fruitShe wonders why he
stays
She leaves her
home and walks toward the
sea
,
she
sees
him embark
her child goes toothe
sailors

the
sails
the
vessel

she
shrieks
but there my heart
was wrung
so
keenly, I could go no farther.
I left the wife, and followed the poor negrohe
had no comfort but the idea that he
should
be with
his child; that he
should
have it in his power to
ease
him if heavy
tasks
were
imposed
, to guard him from
dangers, and teach him to be
resigned
and
contented
.They

exposed
to
sale
and allotted to different
masters
.
Alas! poor man, tears and intreaties are vain; you
are in the hands of the
sons
of Mammon.
Fancy
still
led me forwardI
saw
him when age
and infirmities came on without one comfort,
without
one friend, on a
miserable
bed,
sickness
and
sad
ren embrance his only companionshe is
weary
of lifehe offers up a prayer for his
still
dear
companion, for his children, his
hapless
enslaved
child
He diesand is thrown into the grave without a
prayer to
consecrate
the ground, without one tear of
affection or regret being
shed
upon his bier.
Had not that poor negro a
soul
?
Yesand in futurity it
shall
appear white and
spotless
at the throne of Grace, to confound the man
who called
himself
a
Christian
, and yet betrayed a
fellow-creature into bondage.
It would give me a great deal of
pleasure
,
said
I,
to have the
history
of the
East
Indiansbut
when I
have got it, how
shall
I
translate
itI know nothing
of the language; but, perhaps I may be able to
procure
a
person
to
translate
it for me.
How do you do? my good friend,
said
a man,
rather
shabbily
dressed
Now I make it a rule
never
to turn my back on a man
because
he had rather
wear a thread-bare coat than run in debt with his
taylor
;
so
I turned about to
present
my hand to the
person
who
addressed
me with
such
cordiality, and
perceived in him the features of an old
school
fellow.
The CLERGYMAN.
Ifear
,
said
I, as we went forwardI fear you
have not been
successful
in gaining any permanent
settlement
pray how have you
disposed
of
yourself
these
last
seven
years?
I have, he replied, been
strangely
tossed
about,
beheld
various
scenes
, tried many different plans, and
been
unsuccessful
in all.
When I left Oxford, I was recommended by a
friend of my father's to be preceptor to the only
son
of a man of large fortunehe was a
sprightly
,
sensible
lad, but exceedingly capricious in his humour,
which was owing to his parent's never allowing him
to be contradicted. For a month or fix weeks we
went on very well; my young gentleman was fond
of learning, took every thing with
surprising
facility,
and gave me little or no trouble in obliging him to
attend his bookbut the unbounded
applause
he
received
from his parents, the
caresses
and indulgences
they were continually heaping on him, and the
praise
every
casual
guest
was obliged to
bestow
on this
darling of the family,
soon
made him think he was
as learned as any of the
seven
wife men of Greece,
and therefore had no farther need of a preceptor.
When I found he grew
careless
and neglectful,
I thought a little correction might be
necessary
; but,
on trying the experiment, was called by the over fond
mother, an inhuman
monster
; and the father thought
his boy had a genius too bright to require
such
rough
methods of proceeding. In
short
, Sir, having no
power over the child, he
soon
lost
what little
learning
he had at
first
attained; and I was
dismissed
with
the character of having ruined the boy's genius by
ill-timed
and unmerciful correction.
As I had taken orders, I lived for
some
time by
occasionally
reading prayers, or preaching for a
vicar
who was very old and infirm, but having a large
family, could not well afford to pay a
constant
curate
.In
the
course
of this time I became
acquainted
with a young lady
possessed
of every virtue that
might render her a
desirable
companion; add to this,
she
had two hundred pounds in her own
possession
,
and lived with an uncle, who,
beside
an affluent
fortune
,
had an excellent living in his giftthe old
incumbent
of which was in a very declining
state
of
healthhad Maria been poor I
should
have loved
her; but I
should
never have thought of marrying
her in the
circumstances
I then was, as I knew it
must
involve us both in
misery
. She was all
gentleness
;
and while
she
thought the
sentiment
she
felt
for me was only pity for my precarious,
disagreeable
situation
, it by degrees ripened into a tender and
lasting
affection.Her uncle had ever
studied
her
happiness
, and thinking it would
soon
be in his
power to
settle
us both in an
easy
,
desirable
living,
he encouraged my
pretensions
, and in a few months
made me the
husband
of Maria.
It would be
needless
to mention the
happiness
I
enjoyed for eight months with this amiable woman;
suffice
it to
say
, I envied not the
wealthiest
or
most
oppulent man in Europe. But our
happiness
was
too great to be permanenther uncle had ever been
a man of
sound
constitution
, and though then in the
sixtieth
year of his age, gave no
signs
of infirmity or
decay: but, alas! who can depend on
so
frail a
thing as life.One morning having waited
breakfast
till near ten o'clock,
surprised
at the old
gentleman's
lying
so
long, as he was in general an early
rifer, I tapped at his chamber door, but received no
answer
. I opened it, and went in, and
sound
he
had taken his final leave of this world. I felt
myself
extremely
shocked
; but fearing for Maria, who,
at that time was pregnant, I
composed
myself
, and
going down, told her, that her uncle being rather
indisposed
,
desired
not to be
disturbed
.
On pretence of going for an apothecary I went
and informed an intimate friend of Maria's with the
melancholy affair. We determined
she
should
call
and take Maria out, and by various methods keep
her from home all day; when in the evening we
would, by degrees, acquaint her with the
sad
tidings
But all
these
precautions were vain. During my
absence
, one of the
servants
had entered the room,
which in my agitated
state
of mind I had forgot to
lock, and
instantly
alarmed her
mistress
. At my
return I found my poor Maria in an agony of grief,
which, however, was happily of no ill
consequence
to
herself
or the infant.
When my uncle was buried, we examined his
papers, and no will being found, a
distant
male
relation
took
possession
of the whole
estate
. I removed
with my wife from the
house
;
still
flattering
myself
when the old incumbent died I
should
have the
living; but I was
mistaken
. In a few months the
old man paid the debt of nature, and the living was
disposed
of to another
person
.
Our
disappointment
was very greatbut the two
hundred pounds Maria
possessed
hindered us from
being immediately
exposed
to want, but that
sum
was gradually
decreasing
beside
a child which
was born
soon
after my uncle's
decease
, Maria
promised
to make me father of another. At any other
time this would have given me great
pleasure
but the
unsettled
state
of my affairs made me regret
that this poor little infant was coming into a world
to inherit nothing but penury.
About this time I was recommended to Lord
Ernoff,
whose
eldest
son
was going abroad, and
wanted
H
a governor; however painful it might be to part
with Maria, yet the
promise
of a
handsome
salary
led me to accept the
proposal
.
I left the dear woman, and
set
out to make the
tour of Europe with my young Lord.I had been
absent
from my native country three years, and
found
myself
highly in favour with the young
gentleman
abroad, and his father at homewho, to
recompense
my fidelity to his
son
, was continually
heaping favours on Maria and the children.
We were at Madrid, when my Lord commenced
an intrigue with a woman of rank and reputation.
It was in vain I
represented
to him the
dangerous
consequences
that might
ensue
from
such
an
illicit
amour.The more I
remonstrated
, the more
obstinate
he appeared; and unfortunately
soon
succeeded
in ruining the object of his
dishonorable
pursuit
.
Having obtained every favour from the
easy
,
thoughtless
Leonilla, he was preparing to leave
Madrid
.She
was informed of his
design
(and the
revenge
of a
Spanish
woman, when injured, being
always
adequate to the love they once bore their
seducer
)
she
hired bravoes to
dispatch
this young
nobleman
the night preceding that appointed for our
departure.
We had dined outand the evening being fine,
preferred walking home rather than going in a
carriage
.
I perceived two men watch and follow us through
every
street
, till coming to one that was dark and
unfrequented, one of the men came up and
attempted
to
stab
my Lord.I drew my
sword
, and aiming
at the villain's heart, threw
myself
before the young
nobleman, and received the poniard of the
second
assassin
in my own
bosom
.
This little
scuffle
having made
some
noise
, people
soon
gathered round, when the ruffians finding
themselves
disappointed
in their aims, made off.My
Lord thinking a longer
stay
at Madrid would be
dangerous, left me to the care of a
surgeon
and
nurse
,
and departed next morning for Paris, from whence
he
proposed
returning to England.
The MOURNER.
My
friend was proceeding in his narrative, when
our attention was engaged by the appearance of a
woman habited like a pilgrim, but in deep
mourning
such
an appearance being uncommon in
England
,
it naturally excited our
curiosity
.
We were in
Kensington
Gardens.
The mourner's
stature
was above the lower
size
,
and there was a certain dignity about her which
spoke
her of no common rankher features had
once been lovely; and even now, though pale and
marked with grief, there was a
something
in them
that engaged the affections, and
insensibly
drew the
heart towards her.She
seated
herself
upon the
ground; and
resting
her elbow on the root of a tree
her head reclining
pensively
on her hand
she
plucked up
some
wild
daisies
that grew round her
it
amused
her for the moment, but recollecting
herself
,
she
cried
They will
soon
die, and I have killed them.
The thought
seemed
to give her
exquisite
pain.
She dropped the
daisies
on the ground, and
burst
into
tears.
I will not look at them,
said
she
,
rising
, and
bending
her
steps
another way.
Alas! poor
soul
,
said
I, it is not
these
flowers you
would fly from, it is
yourself
and your own painful
reflections.
That is very true,
said
she
(turning towards me,
and laying her hand on my arm) I would fain forget
that I was the murderer of an innocent manI am
trying to expiate my fault by
fasting
and hard
penance
.
I have come a pilgrimage of many hundred
miles on foot, nor
rested
my weary limbs, but when
necessity
obliged me to
cross
the
sea
.If I could find
the woman I have made a widow, and the children
I have rendered orphans, I would do
something
to
make their lives happy, and then return home, and
devote
myself
to the
Blessed
Virgin.
Alas, continued
she
,
still
resting
on my arm, and
laying her other hand on her heartalas, you know
not what a
sad
thing it is to be an orphan. I once
had a fatherhad he livedbut, poor man, he had
been to the wars; and when he returned, he met my
mother's
corpse
just
going to the grave.He wept
nothe never once complained, but following in
silence
,
saw
her interredthen laid
himself
down on
the cold turf that covered her, and never
rose
again.
Here
she
seemed
quite
lost
and leaving me
abruptly
,
walked to a retired part of the garden.
I never felt my pity
so
strongly
excited as at this
moment.The whole tenor of the mourner's
discourse
and actions
discovered
the
disorder
of her
mind. She
seemed
to have experienced a variety of
misfortunes which had banithed fair
reason
from her
throne. Poor girl,
said
I, how
severely
must
your
heart have been wrung before you were drove to this
miserable
situation
!
But come,
said
I, turning to my friend,
finish
your
recital.He attempted to
speak
, but was forced to
stop
something
rose
in his throatI felt the
same
in minebut what that was, I will leave to the
imagination
of every reader of
sensibility
.
The COURTIER.
My
Lord's departing from Madrid without me,
continued my friend,
occasioned
a report to be
spread
that I had died of my wounds, and indeed
never
was a man nearer the confines of the grave than
I wasbut by the care and attention of the people
that were about me, I was in
six
weeks able to go
into the country, where I remained above two
months in a languid, weak
state
, during which time
I received not one line from my Lordas
soon
as I
found
myself
able to bear the fatigue of travelling, I
set
forward for England, where I arrived about ten
months
since
, and found my dear Maria in a
situation
truly deplorableThe old Earl was dead, and
his
son
daily expected from Paris, where he had
made a longer
stay
than he at
first
intendedMaria
had been
six
months without receiving any money
on my account, as my Lord had wrote to his father's
sleward
, informing him that I
chose
to be left at
MadridI endeavoured to get employ; and, after
many
fruitless
attempts, at
last
got a curacy of thirty
pounds a year, which is but trifling to
support
a
wife and two childrenI have frequently wrote to
my Lord who has been at his
seat
in
Essex
ever
since
his arrival in England; but either has been
prevented
from
answering
my letters by a multiplicity of
business
,
or he does not
choose
to be troubled with an
indigent friendYet I cannot bring
myself
to think
it
possible
for a human being to be
so
ungrateful as
to turn a deaf ear to the complaint of a man who
once
saved
his life, at the hazard of his ownHe
arrived in town three days
since
; and this day at
two o'clock I
propose
waiting on him, and
requesting
his
assistance
.
We will take an hackney coach, and I will
set
you down at his door,
said
I.
H 2
When we arrived within ten yards of the
house
I
stopped
the coach, and getting out,
wished
my friend
a good morning, and turned down a
street
only to
put on my ringwhen quickening my pace, I was
at the Earl's door as
soon
as he was.
A
servant
appeared,
whose
insolent
carriage
bespoke
the character of his Lord.
You may always judge of a man's general
demeanor
and
disposition
by the behaviour of his
servant
,
the lower
class
of mankind always aping the
manners
of their
superiors
.
After
some
hesitation
, and a few leering,
saucy
looks at the
rusty
garb of my friend, he left him
standing
in the hall, and went up to my Lord.
Having waited full a quarter of an hour, he again
made his appearance at the top of the
stairs
, and
reaching his body partly over the
ballustrades
, called
out, You may come up.
I followed him into the chamber of the young
EarlHe was
sitting
in an
easy
chair,
dressed
in a
long robe de chambre, a
dish
of chocolate in one
hand and the
newspaper
in the other;his back was
partly toward the door;and on my friend's being
announced, he neither turned his head nor
raised
his
eyes from the paper
I have taken the
earliest
opportunity to wait on
your
Lordship
,
said
my friend bowing.
Oh, Mr. Teachum,
said
my Lord, I am glad to
see
youSet Mr. Teachum a chair
said
he to the
servant
and when did you arrive in England, Mr.
Teachum?
I had the honor of informing your
Lordship
by
letter, he replied, about
six
months
since
, and of the
mistake
that was made concerning my
salary
, which
was
stopped
from the time your
Lordship
left
Madrid
.
Why, Teachum,
said
my Lord, lifting up his
eyes for the
first
time from the paper, and looking
at my friend with a
sort
of
surprise
, I thought from
that time you was free from my
service
.
Very true, my Lord; but the wound I received in
your
Lordships
service
confined me to my
apartment
for a long time; and the attendance I received
was very
expensive
I had nothing to depend on
but your
Lordship
's bounty.
Well, I will
see
and
recompense
you for your
salary's
being
stopped
Pray how have you lived
since
your return to
England
?
But poorly my Lord; I have but thirty pounds a
year.
My Lord again looked up; but it was a look of
disbelief
.
And how many children have you?
Two, my Lord; a boy and a girl.
Well, I will
see
and do
something
for the boy
and let me thinkyes, there's the living at
Wiltham
,
about three hundred a yearthat will
just
suit
youcall on me again in a day or two; I
shall
always
be glad to
see
you.
So
saying
, he got up, and, without farther
ceremony
,
walked into the next roommy friend
departed
,
and I followed my LordHe pulled the bell
John,
said
he to the
servant
that entered, I
desire
you will tell the porter never to admit that
shabby
parson
again; I don't like to be teazed with
visits
from
such
mean-looking people.
Mr Bauble waits below,
said
the
servant
.
Desire
Mr. Bauble to walk upand when
Miss
L'
Estrange
comes, let me know.
The jeweller entered, and in a few moments after,
Miss
L'
Estrange
;
whose
levity of carriage,
studied
negligence, and confident
stare
, at once
spoke
her
profession
.
A number of jewels were
displayed
; and this
Lord who had not a guinea to
spare
for the poor
man who
saved
his life,
lavished
four hundred pounds
on jewels for an infamous
strumpet
.
And is
such
a man,
said
I, as I left the
house
, is
such
a man as this a peer of the realm? can he, who
ought to ornament the nation, thus
shamefully
disgrace
it!Of all the crimes man can commit,
ingratitude
is the
blackest
; It argues a depravity of
heart, a mind
stupid
and
insensible
; it
sets
a man
below the brute creationthe animal word in
general
are grateful, affectionate, and faithfulBut man
man,
whose
boasted
reason
makes him lord over
those
who act merely from
instinct
,
loses
his
superiority
by folly and ingratitudeI am certain that
the man who is unmindful of a benefit conferred on
him by a brother mortal, is totally
destitute
of
gratitude
toward the great
source
of his life, health and
prosperity
.
The VISIT.
I will
go and
see
Teachum,
said
I, one day,
after having recounted his
story
to my EmmaShe
would accompany me
Their habitation was
small
, but every thing about
it was neat to
excess
; there was nothing to be
seen
that
spoke
distress
; the children were clean; Maria
herself
, though her attire was plain, appeared the
model of elegance
she
was hearing her children
their
lesson
; they
stood
before her, reading each
alternately
a
verse
from the
sacred
writings.
Teachum was leaning over the back of her chair,
gazing at his children, with eyes
expressive
of as
much
pleasure
, and far more
serenity
, than the
miser
who contemplates his hoarded
treasure
We are come to
spend
an hour with you,
said
I,
leading my Emma into the room.
Maria was
embarrassed
; but
she
was too polite to
make
unnecessary
excuses
concerning her
dress
or
apartmentI always think
such
apologies are a
sort
of reproof for an untimely
visit
.
Have you
seen
my Lord lately?
said
I.
He is never at home, replied Teachum.
I am
sorry
for it,
said
I; and believe me, my
friend, I think your attendance on him is entirely
unnecessary
, and your hopes from that quarter
fruitless
I
have taken the liberty of calling, to offer you
any
service
that is in my power, and to beg you will
look upon me as your friend. I
shall
hope to
see
you often at my
house
.
And I hope,
said
Emma, that Mrs. Teachum and
my little friends here will always accompany you.
I have been
sadly
perplexed for
these
few days,
said
I, changing the
conversation
I have got a
manuscript
in my
possession
written in the
Eastern
language
;
I am certain it contains
some
extraordinary
incidents, but cannot get at the particulars, being
almost
entirely unacquainted with the characters it
is wrote in.
It is lucky,
said
Teachum, that you have
mentioned
it to me; I ever took great
pleasure
in
studying
the
Eastern
languages, and am a great admirer of
their
stile
; it is
simple
and elegant, and though we
may
translate
it with tolerable
correctness
, we can
never entirely
preserve
its native purityIf you will
put the
manuscript
into my hands I will
use
my
endeavours
to
translate
it. I have many
leisure
hours,
in which I
amuse
myself
with my pen.
I was highly
pleased
with the idea of having the
adventures of the poor Indian in my native language,
and
desired
Teachum to call on me next day; when
fearful of paining them by a longer
visit
, we
reluctantly
took our leave.
Emma, at parting, put
something
into the hand
of the girl; and
seeing
I
observed
her,
she
took my
hand when we were
seated
in the carriageit was
but a trifle, my love,
said
she
; and I had
saved
it
from my own private expences.
Had
she
just
been giving away half my fortune,
the look, the manner in which
she
pronounced
these
words, would have
instantly
obtained
forgiveness
.
The METHODIST.
Emma
intended to call on
several
of her
acquaintance
.I
hate
visits
of ceremony
so
alighting
from the carriage, I
strolled
into the fields.
An itinerant preacher was mounted above a
listening
multitude, bawling out the virtues and
excellencies
of charity, and
strongly
recommending
brotherly
love among the electall his cry was faith and
charity; at the
same
time he declared every one to
be in a
state
of perdition that differed from his
sect
in their opinion concerning religious matters. I
never was partial to people of this
persuasion
; not
that I condemn the whole
class
no, far be it from
me to
censure
a large body of people,
because
some
of
the members are hypocrites.I have known many
people who
prosess
Methodism
, humane, charitable,
and
just
; but they were people of enlarged ideas,
and liberal educationthe
solemn
gait
sanctified
air
upcast
eyesand tongue ever ready with
scripture
phrases
and quotations, are by no means the
signs
of genuine piety.A chearful, contented
disposition
a heart grateful for every
blessing
, and
resigned
to the all-
wise
dispensations
of Providence
and an hand ready to
bestow
on others part of the
blessings
we enjoy
ourselves
;
these
are the
results
of pure religion
these
are acceptable
sacrifices
in
the
sight
of our Creator.
When the preacher had
finished
his oration, he
descended
from the tub on which he had
stood
; and
with his hat in his hand, walked round to his
numerous
congregation, every one warm with the
impression
made by his
discourse
, readily contributed
something
towards the
support
of a man who was
so
eloquent in recommending them to
seek
the right
way to eternal
happiness
.
The collection that was made
must
have amply
repaid him for the time and breath he had
spent
in
exhorting them to charity.
I
should
like to know,
said
I, whether this man
practises
the virtue
himself
, he
so
strongly
recommends
to others.
I put on my ring and followed him home.
His habitation was at
Chelsea
at his door he was
met by a woman decently
dressed
, but dejected in her
countenanceher eyes were
swolen
with tears.
Well
said
the man,
pushing
rudely by her, is he
gone?
He is gone,
she
repliedgone for ever.
What, is he dead?
Yes.
And in my
house
why was he not removed to
the work
house
?
Alas, Sir, replied the woman, the
parish
officers
came to take him away; and the exertions he made
to
rise
and
dress
himself
being too much for his
weak frame, he expired as they were putting him
into
the chair.
And, who will pay for the funeral?
The
parish
will.
And, do you think he
shall
go out of this
house
till I am paid my rent?No, no, as he has died here,
he
shall
stay
till every farthing owing me is
discharged
.Have
you got any money now?
Not one halfpenny, or a
morsel
of bread for my
poor childrenBut I will
sell
my bedit is the
last
thing I have left, and we will henceforth
sleep
on
straw
.
You
shall
sell
nothingtouch nothing till I am
paid.What, do you think I am to
lose
a whole
year's rent?
Have you no
compassion
on a poor widow and
six
fatherless
children?
said
the woman.
I do not know what
business
such
poor folks have
to get children, he replied. Go, go along, woman;
I am going to dinner, and cannot be troubled with
your whining and complaints.
I took off my ring; and following the poor
woman
up
stairs
, gave her
something
to quiet the
apprehensions
her inhuman landlord's
discourse
had
inspired
.
As I
passed
from the
staircase
to the
street
door, I
heard this teacher of charity pouring forth a long
grace over his meat.
Hypocritical wretch!
said
I,
dost
thou think this
lip
service
is acceptable to God?
Mistaken
man,
thou art mocking the Lord of the
universe
.Go,
divide your meal with the widow and the
fatherless
it is the
best
way of
shewing
your gratitude to him
who gave it you.
Such men as this,
said
I, as I left the
house
, are
a great deal more prejudicial to
society
than the
professed
libertine. When we
see
a man neglect all
religious dutiesbreak through all ties moral and
divine, we naturally turn from him with horror and
detestation
.But, when a man under the cloak of
piety and virtue, who
professes
a
just
sense
of
religion
,
is
discovered
to be hard-hearted
oppressive
avaricious
selfish
in
short
, living in the private
practice of every vice he publicly declaims
against
;
is it not enough to make the generality of the world
conclude that religion is no more than a
specious
mask
put on to deceive mankind?
Religion, in her own native
simplicity
, is truly
lovely
she
attracts admirationcharms the
soul
by
her preceptsand
passing
with us through life
blunts the points of
those
arrows of affliction which
it is the lot of every mortal to experience.
But,
hypocrisy
too often puts on her
pleasing
garb;
and, when
discovered
, leads mankind to think the
angel face of piety hides the foul fiend beneath.
The STUDY.
Mr.
Teachum was in my
study
full half an hour
before I came down.Well, my friend,
said
I, as
I entered, don't you think I have got a fine parcel of
writings?Here in this drawer, pointing to one
that was partly open, I keep all my heroic poetry
here is another for playsanother for odes,
sonnets
,
pastorals
, &c.What a charming prize
these
would be to
some
garreted author; he might
sell
all this
waste
paper for at
least
two pence a
poundit would then turn to
some
account, for
it might
serve
to wrap penny worths of tobacco
light pipes, fires, &c. or, in
short
, be applied to any
other
use
the
possessor
might want
waste
paper for.
What an humiliating idea!
said
my friend,
smiling
.
Not at all,
said
I; in following the dictates of
imagination, and employing my pen, I
please
, I
amuse
myself
but if my writings are not
so
lucky as
to
please
and
amuse
others, why
should
I be
mortified
?every
man has a peculiar
taste
; and
between
I
you and I, my friend, every man has a
peculiar
hobby-
horse
, on which he frequently mounts,
and rides away
post
haste
, without once
considering
who he may
discompose
, overturn, or offend in the
wild career.
I know one man, who, though
possessed
of a very
moderate fortune, and who has had but a confined
education, is
so
fond of aping the
insolent
carriage
of a Lord, that he is continually
distressing
his
companions
by affected grimaces, and
studied
gestures
then he
speaks
in
such
a pompous
stile
, and
assumes
such
an air of
consequence
, that while he thinks he
is received with admiration, every man of
sense
must
laugh at his folly.
Another is fond of
displaying
his profound
learning
in the different
sciences
at one time he is a
professor
of
music
at another time he
studies
logic;
and when by chance you mention either of
those
sciences
,
he will run on at
least
two hours without
either
taking breath, or giving you an opportunity to
edge in a
single
word.
These
are their hobby
horses
writing is mine.
I would not give up the
pleasure
of writing for any
pecuniary gratification that could be offered.
That is,
said
my friend,
because
you
stand
in
need of no pecuniary favours; but,
ask
the poor
author
,
who, in an airy apartment, three
stories
from
the ground,
sits
invoking the coy
muses
to
assist
him
in writing
something
to gain him a few guineas that
might
serve
to
satisfy
his butcher, baker, &c.
ask
him, my good friend, if he will give up the
pleasure
of writing, to enjoy a
settled
salary
of
sixty
pounds
a year.
He might readily
promise
to do
so
,
said
I; but
take my word for it, the very
first
time pen, ink,
paper
,
and opportunity
sell
in his way, he would write
an eulogium on the man who had thus
generously
raised
him from
distress
.
Oh, ye
sweet
tuneful
sisters
, may ye never
forsake
my
mansion
; but when on the wing to
visit
your
favouritesBurney, Moore, and Inchbald
stop
for
a moment, and dart a
single
ray of your
sacred
fire
upon the
humblest
of your votariesin a
sad
hour
it will enliven mein a lonely hour,
amuse
and,
when
happiness
deigns to be my companion, it will
increase
every
pleasure
.
But come,
said
I to Teachum, here is the
story
I
wish
you to
translate
.I am going out for a few
hours, and
shall
hope to
see
it in fair
English
characters
when I come back.You
shall
see
part of
it at
least
,
said
he. So I left him; and mounting
my
horse
which was at the door, rode into Hyde
Park.
The FRACAS.
On
my entering the Park, I
saw
at a
distance
, a
multiplicity of people,
some
running one way,
some
another, and all in the
utmost
confusion
.I rode up
to the place, and the
first
thing that
presented
itself
to
my view, was
Miss
L'
Estrange
in a fit; and a few
paces from her, a young man laying on the ground,
bleeding. By his
side
knelt the fair mourner whom
I had
seen
in
Kensington
Gardens
she
was
endeavouring
to
staunch
the blood that
issued
from his
side
,
with her handkerchiefit
seemed
a
scene
of
confusion
,
for no one was paying the
least
attention to the
wounded man but this unhappy woman.
I called my
servant
, and giving him my
horse
,
raised
the young man from the ground; and
presently
perceived it was Lord Ernolf, whom Teachum
had attended abroad.
I
assisted
the fair mourner to bind up his wound
with our handkerchiefs, and a
servant
at that
moment
arriving with a
surgeon
and a litter, we lifted
him on it, and proceeded to the
nearest
house
the
surgeon
thinking the
sooner
his wound was
dressed
the better.
The mourner followed
pensively
often
crossing
herself
,
sighing
, and weeping bitterlyno one
attempted
to
obstruct
her entrance into the
house
with
us.
The wound was
dressed
, and the
surgeon
pronounced
it not dangerous, provided a fever could be
prevented.
Lord Ernolf had fainted through
loss
of blood;
and during the time of his wound being
dressed
,
remained
in a
state
of
insensibility
.
It was judged proper that he
should
be
immediately
put to bed; but, when the
servant
attempted
to move him, the mourner came to me and
entreated
that
she
might not be
separated
from him
for, indeed Sir,
said
she
, I heartily forgive himI
do not
wish
his death now, though once I
sought
to
have
assassinated
him; but I have
since
been taught that
we
should
forgive
those
who injured us. Alas! if
it were not for the reflection that I am not at
enmity
with any mortal breathing, how
should
I have hope
to obtain pardon of my Creator for the heinous
crime I have committed
whilst
in
pursuit
of my
revenge!
I thought from
these
few words that this
hapless
mourner could be no other than poor Leonilla.
I entreated the people of the
house
to let her
remain with the wounded nobleman; and attended
her up to his chamber, where he was in bed, and
just
recovering his
senses
.
She approached the bed, and
sitting
down on the
side
, took one of his hands
kissed
it, and
pressed
it
to her
bosom
.
He lifted his languid eyes, and fixed them on her
faceat
first
they
spoke
amazement and terrorbut
at
last
, grief.
Where am I?
said
heam I
passing
the bounds
of mortality; and art thou,
blest
shade
,
suffered
to
conduct me through the gloomy vale?I know
why you look
so
mournfulyou died of a broken
heartbut, I
shall
be
punished
for my crimes.
Compose
yourself
, my Lord,
said
the mourner
you are in no danger, I hope you may yet live
many
years, and be happy.
Do you talk of
happiness
,
said
he; and do you
wish
me happy?
I do! I do! So Heaven hear my prayers.
But, tell me,
said
he, how came you here?am
I not in England?
She was going to
answer
when I
interposed
and
begged they would both be
silent
, and
consider
of
what dangerous
consequences
a violent exertion of
spirits
might be to the young gentleman. She
promised
obedience, drew the curtains round the bed,
and
sat
down in an
easy
chair that
stood
at the head.
A
nurse
entering, I took that opportunity to go and
inquire what had been the
cause
of this unhappy
affair.
The
servant
who attended
Miss
L'
Estrange
and
his
Lordship
in their ride that morning, gave me the
following account:
That a
strange
gentleman rode up to
Miss
L'Estrange
,
and
accosting
her in a very haughty manner,
inquired why
she
had left him at Paris, and what
she
had done with a miniature picture which
she
had
taken from his cabinet the morning before the left
him; the Lady pretended not to know him, and
complained to my Lord that
she
was
insulted
; upon
which, high words
ensued
between the
stranger
and
Lord Ernolf, when the former, having a pair of
pistols
ready in his pocket, offered one to my Lord,
I 2
who being naturally of a warm
disposition
, took it,
and before any
interposition
could be made, they
both fired; my Lord's
pistol
took no effect, but the
stranger
's wounded him in the manner you have
seen
.
At the
discharge
of the
pistols
Miss
L'
Estrange
fainted
;
but I believe, it was more for fear of the life of
the gentleman than my Lord's. I ran as
fast
as I could
for a
surgeon
.
The
servant
was proceeding in his
story
when he
was called away.
Having gained this intelligence, I determined to
go immediately to
Miss
L'
Estrange
, who was now
become an inmate of Lord Ernolf's
house
, and
see
in what manner
she
behaved, and whether the
servant's
suspicions
were well founded.
I repaired immediately to his
Lordship
's
house
inquired for the lady, but was denied admittancea
chariot and four was at the doorI feared
some
soul
play; and thinking there was no time to be
lost
, I
watched my opportunity, and, putting on my ring,
went into the
house
, and up to the Lady's apartment.
I found her
sitting
on a
sopha
with a large quantity
of jewels, &c. on a table before her; the was
busied
in
packing them up, but often turned and
addressed
some
endearing
expressions
to an officer who
sat
beside
her, entreating him never to
forsake
her again,
and telling him what riches the had heaped together
since
she
had lived with Lord Ernolf.
I examined the features of the pretended officer,
and in
spite
of a large black patch which he had over
one eye, and his eye-brows and complexion being
stained
, I
soon
discovered
it to be the villain Cogdie,
who had
escaped
from the officers of
justice
as they
were conveying him from Gretna Green to London.
I learned from the
conversation
that
passed
between
Cogdie and
Miss
L'
Estrange
, that
she
was
in reality his lawful wife; but, being of a
loose
disposition
,
had broken the matrimonial bonds
some
years
since
, and
visited
most
of the capitals in
Europe
with a young nobleman,
whose
fortune
she
had
ruined, and finding him no longer able to
support
her extravagance,
she
had left Paris with Lord
Ernolf, with whom
she
had lived for this
twelve-month
past
.
I found,
also
, that chance had thrown Cogdie in
her way; and that he,
seeing
her in
so
prosperous
a
situation
, and being
himself
at a very low ebb of
fortune
,
had
persuaded
her that his
passion
for her was
stronger
than ever, and endeavoured to prevail with
her to rob the Earl, and decamp with him.But
L'
Estrange
was a woman
whose
avarice was not
so
easily
gratified:
she
, by feigning the
most
passionate
tenderness
for the Earl, had worked upon his temper
till
she
persuaded
him to make a will greatly in her
favour; and then the
insult
, &c. which happened in
the Park, was planned and executed by Cogdie. He
had marked the
pistols
; the one he gave to Lord
Ernolf was charged only with powder, but that which
he retained
himself
was loaded with ball.
I was greatly at a
loss
how to act, as I feared to
leave the
house
to procure proper
persons
to
secure
Cogdie, left in the mean time he
should
escape
.
L'
Estrange
told him he ought to prepare for
flight; and giving him
several
bank notes,
some
jewels
,
and other valuables,
stepped
into another room
and brought out a gown, petticoats, &c. for him to
put on.I was quite undetermined in what manner
to prevent his departure, when L'
Estrange
recollected
there was
some
more money in a bureau in Lord
Ernolf's apartment, which was in a
distant
part of
the
house
; I followed, and
seeing
her
safe
in the
closet
, in which there was no bell, and only a
small
high window, and that
secured
with bars; I pulled
to the door, locked and bolted it; I then returned in
haste
to the apartment where Cogdie was, and
seeing
him totally
absorbed
in the
pleasure
of contemplating
his
treasure
,
fastened
both the doors without being
observed
.
Having
succeeded
thus far, I left the
house
with
precipitation, and procured proper people to
apprehend
them; I returned within half an hour, and
demanded
entrance. Though I had been
absent
so
short
a time, five minutes longer had been too late;
Cogdie and L'
Estrange
had by their cries alarmed
the
servant
; for each fearing the other intended
information
against
themselves
, were in the
utmost
consternation
; and violent were their cries for
liberty
the
servants
had
burst
open the doors, and
Cogdie was on the
stairs
in order to depart when I
entered.
I committed them both to the charge of the
constable
;
having
first
eased
them of the weighty
concern
of having
so
much money and jewels to take
off. I waited on them to the
house
of a
neighbouring
justice
, made my
accusation
in proper form, and
being certain that apartments in a
strong
, well-built
mansion
, would be prepared for their reception till
farther inquiry
should
be made concerning the
affair
,
I left them, and returned to the wounded
Noblemen
;
and from thence home.
The REPARATION.
I thought
you were
lost
, my love,
said
Emma,
as I entered the parlour about eleven o'clock, and
found her
seated
at
supper
with Teachum and his
Maria.In my hurry and
confusion
in the
morning
,
though I had
sent
my
servant
home, I had not
sent
any
message
by him: I was therefore not
surprised
at my Emma's exclamation. The adventures
of the day had
so
entirely taken up my mind, that
the
East
Indian had not once intruded; and even
when my friend mentioned having
almost
completed
the
translation
, I felt no
sort
of
curiosity
to
see
it.
We will take a walk to-morrow,
said
I to
Teachum
;
I have
seen
Lord Ernolf to-day, and if you
like, I will take you to
visit
him early.
We were at the
house
where he was before ten
o'clock.
As we entered the room without
noise
, we
saw
the fair Leonilla in the
highest
act of devotion; his
Lordship
was
sitting
in the bed,
supported
by pillows,
his eyes fixed with a mixture of love and veneration
on her face, we were unwilling to
disturb
them,
so
drew back behind the curtains. When
she
had
finished
her morning
orisons
Oh, my dear Lord,
said
she
, what a relief do you give my
almost
bursting
heart, by informing me that your governor is not
dead. How
severe
has the reflection always been,
that my
rashness
had
sent
a
deserving
man out of the
world; a man who had honor, courage, affection,
sufficient
to make him value his own life as nothing
when the life of his Lord was in danger. It is that
cruel idea, and the remembrance of my dear father
and mother, that at times deprives me of my
reason
;
but I will be thankful to that good Providence that
has taken this mighty load off my heart.
I hope you have provided for Mr. Teachum,
said
she
, after a little
pause
.
It is a
shame
to own I have not,
said
my Lord;
but I will endeavour to repair all my errors.
Mr. Teachum is come to
see
you, my Lord,
said
I,
stepping
forward.
Ernolf
stretched
out his hand, and taking hold of
Teachum's, cried, this wound, my good Dr.
Teachum
,
is an excellent thing.
Indeed, my Lord, replied Teachum, I do not
believe
any body but
yourself
thinks
so
, all your friends
regret it.
I rejoice in it,
said
his
Lordship
, it makes me
feelingly remember my own ingratitude.
Teachum walked to the other end of the room
he was too much of a
Christian
to rejoice in the pain
of a fellow mortal, though it might be productive of
good to
himself
. After our noble patient's wound
was again
dressed
, he
requested
Leonilla to inform
him why
she
had left her native country.
She
said
, that when
she
found by the rumour then
prevailing at Madrid, that Mr. Teachum was killed
in defending his
Lordship
, it lay very heavy at her
heart, and
she
grew melancholy and
sickly
.I
never
went to
sleep
,
said
she
, but I fancied the
shade
of the innocent man my
rashness
had murdered, was
reproaching me. I thought my mind would be
easier
after
confession
, and went to my holy father,
confessed
my
first
deviation from duty, my grief,
anger
,
revenge, and all its fatal
consequences
.The
good father rebuked the
spirit
of revenge that
still
was harboured in my
bosom
, and taught me that
penitence
,
fasting
, and tears, were the only methods to
gain the pardon of the Creator for my heinous
offences
but
alas! Sir, I could not praymy mind
was in a
state
of horror, not to be
described
remorse
,
love, and rage, by turns tormented my
soul
;
but Heaven offended at my
obstinacy
and folly,
visited
me with a dreadful judgment.I had a favourite
dog which you had given me; on this poor
inoffensive
animal did I vent the various changes of my
temper, one moment
caressing
it, the next
using
it
with the
utmost
barbarity. My dear mother had
never
suspected
my
dishonour
;
she
wondered at the
alteration
so
visible
in my health and
disposition
;
and frequently chid me for my
unkindness
to this
poor little animal. I fear I
used
it very ill; but,
indeed I hardly know what I did, my mind was
so
disordered
.
My dog ran mad, and bit my dear mother; all
medical
assistance
was tried without effect
she
expired
in the
greatest
agony. My father who was
on a campaign
against
the Turks at the time this
happened, unfortunately retured the day before my
mother was buriedhe was unrepared for the
stroke
he
saw
my mother's
corpse
he
saw
me deprived of
my
senses
.
In my delirium I told him how I had
dishonored
his
house
It was too much; he was not equal to
the mighty load of
sorrow
, but
sunk
under it.
Since that, I have wandered about, over barren
hills and
desert
plains,
seeking
content, but
she
fled
from me as I
pursued
her. I thought
she
might
dwell with charity;
so
I divided my portion with
the
fatherless
and the widow; but alas! I could
never
find her
she
is buried in the grave with my dear
parents!
I
saw
that the recital of her misfortunes had
occasioned
a return of her unhappy malady;
so
taking her
by her hand, I led her into another apartment, and
persuaded
her to take
some
repose
.
About
six
weeks after, I had the
pleasure
of
bestowing
her in marriage on the repentant Lord
Ernolf
.
Teachum performed the ceremony; and his
Lord gave him as a marriage portion, the
promised
living of Wiltham.
Leonilla never after
relapsed
into her former
disordered
slate
of mind. She entreated that Cogdie
and his compantons might be forgiven. Her Lord
complied with her
request
; and
she
gave them a
sum
of money, to prevent poverty being an
incentive
to future vice. But they were too far
immerged
in all manner of deceit to think of amendment,
and
soon
returned to their old practices.
I cannot help here relating a
circumstance
that
happened many years after.The
son
which Olivia
brought into the world, the fruit of her unfortunate
attachment to Cogdie, as he advanced in years,
shewed
no
signs
of any of his father's vices in his
disposition
,
except a
propensity
to gaming.This
propensity
he once indulged at a public gaming
house
,
where an old man having won from him a
considerable
sum
of money, which the young
spark
imagining
was not won by fair play; high words
arose
, and
a challenge was given.
They met, fired, and the old man was wounded.
The
son
of Olivia, though
hasty
in his temper,
was generous, humane, and forgiving; he
wished
not to take the life even of the man who had
wronged
him.
He had him carried to his lodgings; and finding
him in a poor
situation
, he
sent
for a
surgeon
, and
supplied
him with all the
necessaries
and comforts of
life at his own expence.
A
servant
in the family who
observed
the frequent
visits
of Olivia's
son
to this mean,
obscure
lodging,
told it as a
secret
to Olivia's maid, who directly told
it to her
mistress
.
Olivia was then at my
house
;
she
had often
wished
an union might take place between her
son
and
Lucy Heartfree, my fair petitioner. The idea of a
secret
mistress
immediately alarmed her.She
desired
me to go with her to the place the
servant
had
mentioned.
I complied.
When we entered the room, the
first
object that
struck
our
sight
was her
son
helping a woman to lift
an infirm,
sickly
old man from a chair to the bed;
he was, to all appearance, near his end.
The old man no
sooner
saw
us than he breathed
a dreadful groan, and fell back in his chair. Olivia
was greatly agitated
she
applied her
salts
to his
nose
.He recoveredhe gazed feebly on her. It
is Olivia,
said
he.She
started
.Do you not know
me, Olivia? have you forgot the wretched
Cogdie
?
Gracious Heaven! cried Olivia, catching hold of
her
son
's hand, it is your father.
My father!
said
the youth; then I am a
parricide
.
Not
so
, my
son
,
answered
Cogdie; you have only
revenged your mother's injuries.But, will you
forgive
me.
May heaven forgive you as freely,
said
Olivia
.
Her
son
knelt, and craved
forgiveness
of his
dying
father.
It is enough
said
Cogdie. I forgive, and hope to
be forgiven.His head
sunk
on Olivia's
shoulder
he groaned and expired.
The CHILDREN.
I think
you have never read Mr. Teachum's
translation
,
said
Emma, one evening, as I was
sitting
by her,
listening
to the innocent prattle of
Harriet
and her little companionI had
some
months
before committed them to the care of Mrs.of
Hammersmith
.
Though I had always heard the
highest
character
of this lady and her
school
, yet my dear Harriet, who
at this time was at home for the holidays,
raised
it in
my opinionLucy,
said
he, let us play at
school
you
shall
be Mrs., and I will be a
scholar
.
You may always judge by the play of children
what company, regulations, and
conversation
, they
are
used
to.
Come here,
Miss
Harriet,
said
Lucy; I hope you
are very well this morning, and quite prepared to
say
your
task
; you know I
shall
take no
excuse
.
K
Come, Ladies, it is eight o'clock, and not all
dressed
yet!Oh
sye
!
Miss
, your face and hands
are not
washed
!how indelicate that is!well, now
we are all ready
so
you
must
kneel down and
say
your prayers.
Do you always
say
your prayers at
school
,
Harriet
?
said
I.
Oh, yes, Papa; Mrs.  not only makes us
say
our prayers, but
she
says
her own prayers with
us.
Do you love Mrs. , my dear?
Yes, indeed, PapaI don't know any body but
what does love her,
she
is
so
good to us all.
I was
so
pleased
with the account the children
gave of this amiable woman, that by means of my
ring I frequently
visited
her
unseen
there was
always
the
same
decent regularity
observed
through the
whole
house
.
She had a relation lived with herI would
mention
some
acts of humanity which I have
seen
this
relation perform, but I fear to hurt her delicacy
Yet there is one which will never be
erased
from
my mind. It was the
kindness
she
shewed
to a poor
young woman who was
distressed
, calumniated, and
beset
with dangersYet
she
knew not the full force
of her benevolence; But I, who
visited
,
unseen
, the
object of her humanity, know, that
she
drew her
from an horrid precipice, from whence
she
must
have
soon
plunged into the gulf of infamy.
Oh! thou gentle pattern of benevolence and
piety
,
judge not the poor young woman from
appearances
could'
st
thou but
see
her heart, thou would'
st
there read gratitude to thee written in indelible
characters
and
when
she
prays for thee,
whose
bounty
she
has received,
she
humbly
asks
of Heaven the
power
to return it.But I am always running from the
subject
I begin with.
My Emma had
requested
me to read Teachum's
translation
of the
Eastern
tale;
so
dismissing
the
children to the
nursery
, and
stirring
up the fire, for
it was a cold evening in December, I
stepped
into
my
sludy
, and brought out the
manuscript
.
SADI and ZELIA.
Sadi
, the
son
of Mahadan, the rich
possessor
of
a
sertile
valley, watered by a beautiful riverwho
had
slaves
at his command, and was called by the
sons
of the
East
, Sadi the Happy.Ah! what avails
possessions
and
treasure
?and what is
terrestrial
happiness
to man?It
vanisheth
like a dreamit
departeth
like the
mist
of the morning before the beams
of the
sun
.
Sadi, the once rich and happy, is a
slave
and
wretched.Go tell this to the daughters of joy
sound
it in the ears of the
sons
of
pleasure
; for
prosperity
has hardened their hearts, and made them
callous
to the feelings of humanity.
Zelia was the
fairest
among the daughters of
Arabia
;
she
was tall, and
straight
as the pine tree;
stately
as the young cedar; her
skin
was like the ripe
olive; her eyes, bright
stars
; her locks were like
the
polished
ebony; and her teeth, fair rows of
pearl; her lips were the colour of the ruby; and
her breath like the breezes blowing from the
spicy
islands
.
I built a bower for my Zelia; I adorned it with
beautiful flowers, and planted
sweet
smelling
shrubs
around it.
With lofty trees I fenced out the
sun
beams; and
the birds dwelt in their branches.In the
recess
was
a
silver
stream
; the
osiers
and wild flowers hung
upon
its banks, and the
swans
sported
on its
bosom
.
I
sought
my love among the daughters of the
plainI wooed her in the
shady
placesI brought
her to the bower I had plantedI culled for her the
choicest
fruitsI brought her
silks
from the looms
of
Persia
I platted her hair with
fresh
flowersI
put
costly
jewels in her earsand with pearls made
bracelets for her arms.
We were the
happiest
among the happy; in the
morning we
arose
together and
worshipped
the
bright luminary of day.We
strayed
over the fertile
valleyswe
sported
with the young
sawns
; or
retired
from the heat, and
reposed
in the thick
shade
.
If I was in pain,
she
would
sooth
me.I
listened
to her angel voice all day; and at night I
reposed
on
her
bosom
.
The curtain of night had fallen over usthe
stars
shot
their beams through the Heavensthe
voice of
distress
met our earsthe plaints of
sorrow
invaded our dwellingwe went forth from the
bowerwe
saw
a
Christian
overpowered by his
adversary
. The blood
issued
from his
bosom
his
face was the picture of terror.
We bore him to our peaceful bowerwe poure I
oil upon his wounds, and Zelia bound them up with
her hands.She watched him with the care of a
sister
she
gave him a part of our fruits, and brought
him milk from the young camels.He was
grateful
for the
kindness
we
shewed
he
swore
by his
God it
should
not be forgotten.But, the word of a
man is like unto the wind; it maketh a
sound
,
passeth
,
and is no more remembered.
He left our bower once at early dawnhe
tarried
till the
close
of evening.
Zelia had retired to
rest
the moon beams played
upon her faceI contemplated her
sleeping
beauties
.
The
Christian
I had
saved
, entered the bower
be brought with him a band of
ruthless
russians
.
He
seized
upon my lovely Zeliahe
listened
not
unto
her crieshe put a chain upon her feet, and
bound the hands which had healed his wounds.
They took our
costly
ornaments and pearlsthey
bound me with an heavy iron chain, and led us like
two
slaves
towards the
sea
.They put us on board a
ship
he had preparedthey
spread
the
sails
the
wind blew from the
shore
, and in the morn we
saw
the main before us.
They took the chains from off my hands and feet
they gave me food, but parted me from Zelia.
I heard her lift up a voice of terrorI heard her
call on Sadi for
assistance
I
rushed
into the room
where they confined herI
saw
her in the embraces
of a villainI
snatched
a poniard from his
side
I
bade him
instantly
forego his prey.
Zelia like lightning darted from his arms
she
cried, Now, Sadi!Sadi, follow me!then, from
the window
sprang
into the ocean.
I
sent
the poniard to the traitor's heart.I felt its
warm blood
gush
upon my hand; then
hastily
obeyed
my charming Zelia.I called her as I plunged
into the
sea
I
sought
my Zelia in the world of
waters
;
but the
spirits
of
blessed
saints
had
seen
her
virtuethey caught the lovely victim as
she
fell, and
bore her on their wings to
paradise
.I called for
death to take a wretched lifeI
sought
the friend of
misery
, but he fled from me.
Some other
Christians
saved
me from the
sea
;
they gave me food, and treated me with
kindness
but the
kindness
of a
Christian
is like the
song
of the
Syren, it
sooths
the
senses
, gains upon the heart;
then,
unsuspected
leads to
destruction
.They took
me with them to the
Western
worldthey fold the
wretched Sadi for a
slave
.
My haughty
spirit
was not
used
to bondage.I
heard that England was the land of freedomI hid
K 2
myself
on board an
English
ship
, and
sailed
unseen
into the
boundless
main.I left my hiding place,
and
sought
the captain, and bowed my face toward
the deck, before him.
He told me, I no more
should
be a
slave
he
brought me with him to this land of freedom.
But, here I found I
also
was deceived; for, here
mankind are
slaves
to vice, to avarice, to luxury, and
to folly.The man who brought me from the
Western
world, demanded payment for my
passage
over.
Alas! I had been rifled by the
Christians
.I had
nought to give but grateful thanks and prayers.
He who had
said
I
should
not be a
slave
, confined
me in a
loathsome
prison
house
this was my
welcome
to the land of freedom.
For
seven
long years I never felt the air, nor ever
saw
the chearful face of Heavenbut the angel of
death that
visits
all the earth, then
stopped
the breath
of my hard
persecutor
. I then was freed from out
the
loathsome
prison
, and for a moment I rejoiced in
liberty; but
soon
I felt the gnawing pangs of
hunger
.
I had no friend
whose
pity might relieve me
the
spacious
city was to me a
desert
, and I was
slarving
in the land of plenty.But, who can bear
the griping hand of famine; who can
sink
under it
and not complain? I laid me down upon the damp,
cold groundI groaned aloud, and tore my hair
through
anguish
; but many
passed
by, nor once
regarded
me; and others
scoffed
and called me an
impostor
.
I thought the end of all my woes was come
I
ceased
to groan, and waited death's approach;
but pity had not wholly fled the world;
she
dwells
within the hearts of
Christian
womenone brought
me
something
to allay my hunger; another put
some
money in my hand.One
seeming
almost
as wretched as
myself
, looked at me,
shook
her head,
and dropt
some
tears. I felt her
kindness
more than
those
beforethe tear of pity healed my bleeding
heart.
But, the woes of Sadi
soon
will have an end;
soon
shall
I
sleep
, and be at
rest
for ever, for the
sorrows
of my heart overpower me, and pain and
sickness
bow me to the earth.The lamp of life is very near
exhausted
; and when each night I lay me down to
rest
, I think not to behold another morning.
And what, alas! has wretched Sadi done? and,
who reduced him to this
state
of
misery
? Go tell the
tale to all the
Eastern
worldGo warn them to
beware
of
trusting
Christians
; for Sadi
saved
one from
the jaws of death, and thus was his humanity
rewarded
.
The CONVERSATION.
This
is a
strange
world,
said
I, laying down the
manuscript
, and
addressing
my dear Emma
The world, my love,
she
replied, laying one hand
on my
shoulder
, and with the other wiping away a
drop which poor Sadi's
story
had excitedthe
world, my love, in
itself
is a charming placeit is
the people in it that makes it uncomfortable. Let
us view it at
first
coming from the hands of the
Creator
;
what beauty, what regularity and order! but
no
sooner
was man created, than pride
avarice
envyrevengeand
a long train of
evils
Not forgetting female vanity and
curiosity
,
said
I,
looking archly at her.
Nay, my dear,
said
she
, don't attribute all your
evils to our
sex
; for I am certain, that had not Adam
had a little
curiosity
in his own
composition
, he
never
could have been prevailed on to
stray
from his
dutybut we are running from the
subject
,
continued
she
.
My remark was, that it is the vile
disposition
of
many people in the world, not the world
itself
, that is
so
disagreeable
to
those
who are
possessed
of
humanity
and feeling. What a delightful place it would
be,
said
I, if harmony, peace, and love
universally
reigned around us; if there was no ingratitude, no
revenge, no rapine, murder, theft, or perjury.
It would,
said
she
; but it is not for us to
say
why
are things thus? let us, my love, endeavour to
perform
our duty, and, as far as example will go, lead
others to do the
same
; and let us be thankful that
the world is not
so
full of allurements as to prevent
our preparing and hoping for a better; for my own
part, continued
she
,
passing
her arm round my neck,
while her lovely countenance beamed with gratitude
and love, my cup overflows with
blessings
; I feel no
sorrow
except it is when I reflect on the vices or
sorrows
of my fellow creatures; yet, I
must
not expect
to
pass
this life exempt from woe.Poor Sadi has
had a life of
misery
, it is true, but
shall
we arraign
the power omnipotent, and
say
, why was it
so
?
My dear, Emma,
said
I, I did not mean to
complain
of the
dispensations
of Providence when I
said
it is a
strange
world; but does it not appear
wonderful
that a man can
so
far forget a benefit as to treat
his benefactor with cruelty?
It is unaccountable,
said
she
; and yet we hear of
it in more
instances
than onewhat a
striking
proof
of ingratitude is related in
Addison
's pathetic
story
of Incle and Yarico
Oh, a propos,
said
I, you never gave me your
opinion
of the opera taken from that
story
I was greatly
pleased
with it,
she
replied; I think
the author
shews
great judgment in the
management
of his plot; for after having excited in our
imagination a proper horror for the avarice and
ingratitude
of Incle, by
contrasting
it with the blunt
honesty
of Trudge, he makes his hero repent, and,
by unexpectedly bringing him to act with honor and
humanity towards his kind
preserver
, leaves no
impression
on the mind of the audience but an entire
love and admiration of virtue.
I think the remark extremely
just
,
said
I, which
Incle makes in the
conclusion
of the piecethat, his
contracted ideas, and
grasping
disposition
, was
chiefly
owing to his education.
There is nothing, replied my Emma, which, in
my opinion,
should
be
so
carefully inculcated in the
mind of a child as humanitythere are many
parents
who, out of a
mistaken
fondness
for their
children
,
will
suffer
them, by way of
amusement
, to rob
birds
nests
, catch butterflies, &c. and transfix them
with pins, and a
thousand
other whims and fancies
which are the height of cruelty;
these
things by
degrees
harden their hearts, and they can afterwards
practise
cruelty on their fellow creatures without
repugnance
.I
would always teach my children to be
tender even to the
smallest
insect
that has life; if,
indeed, they are obnoxious or
poisonous
, and
poionous">poisonous
, and
self-preservation
leads us to
destroy
them, let them be
dispatched
quick and with as little pain as
possible
.
Then opening a volume of our immitable
Shakespeare
,
she
read the following
passage
in
Measure
for
Measure
:
The poor blind beetle which we tread upon,
In corporeal
suff
'rance feels as much
As when a giant falls.
Hail, humanity! fair daughter of Heaven, it is
thou, bright angel, that can
smooth
the bed of pain,
and blunt the
sharpest
arrow of
distress
: come, thou
celestial
guest
! and dwell with me, and with thee
bring thy
sweet
companion gratitude.
Almighty Power! creator of the
universe
,
said
I,
teach me to
shew
my gratitude to thee by
practising
humanity towards my fellow creatures.
The REGISTER OFFICE.
I hope
you will not
disappoint
me, Madam,
said
a young woman to an old fat dame, who kept a
Register
Office for hiring of
servants
I had entered
the
house
by means of my ring.
The young woman was
something
below the
middle
size
, her countenance was dejected, and
she
appeared
not to be
used
to
servitude
.
You had better
sit
down and
rest
yourself
, my
dear,
said
the old woman.
I will, if you
please
, replied the other; for it is a
long walk from Lambeth.
She entered a little parlour, and
sat
down; when
I learnt from their
conversation
that the young
woman
,
whom I
shall
henceforth call Mariana, was
applying
for a place as
governess
to one or two young
ladies, and was
promised
by the woman who kept
the office that
she
should
be recommended to Lady
Allworth, who wanted a
governess
for her two
daughters.
It is now
six
weeks,
said
Mariana,
since
I was
first
proposed
to Lady Allworth, and I
should
be glad
to know whether
she
will have me or no, for my
circumstances
are
such
as render it
absolutely
necessary
that I
should
have
some
place in a
short
time
To-morrow
,
Mrs. Ly, I hope you will go with me.
The old woman
promised
faithfully to attend her,
and at ten o'clock the next morning was appointed
for her to call.
Then to-morrow I will
see
thee again, poor,
gentle
Mariana,
said
I.
I was by no means
pleased
with the woman who
kept the office; for while Mariana was
resting
herself
,
two young men of
fashion
came into the room.
I
blush
to think, that their being young men of
fashion
rendered me
uneasy
on the poor girl's
account
.
There were
some
very intelligent looks
passed
between
them and the old woman; and immediately
on their leaving the room Mariana was invited to
dine the
ensuing
day.
At ten, the next day, Mariana again repaired to
the office, and was again
disappointed
of waiting on
Lady Allworth.
I know not what to do,
said
she
, as
she
left the
house
; and a tear
stole
down her cheekShe had
refused
the invitation to dinner, and was proceeding
with melancholy
steps
towards her homeI
followed
her.
When
she
entered the
house
she
was wet, cold,
and hungry; but there was neither fire nor
refreshment
.
She
sat
down at the end of a long table, and
leaning
her head upon her hands, the tears flowed
plenteously
down her pale face
she
looked the picture of
dumb
despair
.
I was thinking of
some
method to relieve her,
when a
short
, fat old gentleman entered the room.
I read in your face, Mariana,
said
he, that you
have had no
success
to-day.
She
shook
her head, and
asked
his advice how to
proceed.
I would
advise
you to go to Lady Allworth
yourself
write
a letter,
send
it up, and wait for an
answer
from her
ladyship
.
Mariana wiped her eyes, wrote a letter, and then
proceeded to
measure
back the weary
steps
she
had
trod before.
Poor girl!
said
I, as I followed her, I
should
like
to know how you were reduced to this
situation
;
but I will not leave you till I
see
you are likely to
get
some
settlement
Youth and innocence without
friends or money, in
such
a place as London,
must
have a hard
struggle
to keep free from vice; and
will find it
impossible
to keep free from
censure
.
I
wish
Lady Allworth may be as much
prepossessed
in your favour as I ambut perhaps
she
will
not
see
you; and
should
she
not, you
shall
not be
lost
for want of a friend.
I do verily believe, that during our walk from
Lambeth to St. James's Street, I was
almost
as much
agitated as Mariana
herself
.
She tapped
modestly
at the door; but I could
see
it was humiliating to her.
A
servant
appeared, and
she
was
instantly
admitted
Will you deliver this to Lady Allworth?
said
she
,
presenting
the letter.
The
servant
looked at her with
compassion
I
thus
translated
his looks: this poor girl is come to
entreat a favour of my Lady; I will not be the
means of her not obtaining it; I
wish
she
may meet
with
success
.
Sir James Allworth,
said
I, is a benevolent man:
he never
suffers
a petitioner to be treated with
rudeness
or
disrespect
: I can read his humanity in the
countenance of his
domestic
.
I had hardly time for the reflection before
Mariand
was
desired
to walk up
stairs
I perceived that
she
trembled as
she
ascended
; but had her fears been
ever
so
great, they
must
all have
vanished
at the
sight
of Lady Allworth.
The DRESSING ROOM.
She
was an elegant woman, though arrived to an
age when the bloom and
sprightliness
of youth is
past
; yet her face had a benignity about it that
diffused
itself
over all her features, and
seemed
enlivened
by a ray of
celestial
light; her fine black eyes
were of that
sort
that would pierce the
inmost
recesses
of a guilty
soul
, but withal, tempered with
so
much benevolence, that to the innocent they
seemed
to beam only with humanity and
compassion
.Her
form was
majestic
, and in her manner was a
mixture
of dignity,
ease
, and
sweetness
.
Mariana's countenance brightened up when
she
saw
this lovely woman
she
curtised
, and a feint
blush
tinged her cheeks
You are the
person
who wrote this letter?
asked
her
Ladyship
.
Yes, Madam.
Pray, who was it that pretended to recommend
you to me?
Mariana informed her.
Good God! cried Lady Allworth; I know
nothing
of the woman; I never applied to her for a
servant
in my life; and
should
never have thought
of applying to an office for a
governess
.
Mariana turned pale, and with difficulty
restrained
her tears.
But pray, continued her
Ladyship
, pray, Ma'am,
inform me how you came to apply to an office:
have you no friends?
But one, Madam, and
she
is not in a line to
recommend
me.
Poor girl!
said
Lady Allworth,
softly
she
thought the exclamation of pity too humiliating to
L
be
addressed
to Mariana
herself
: it was an
involuntary
motion of the lips dictated by a feeling
heart.
Pray,
sit
down, Ma'am continued her
Ladyship
,
and, if it is not
disagreeable
, inform me how you
came into
such
a place as London without friends:
I feel
myself
interested
in your behalf, and if it is
in my power I will
serve
you.
Mariana
sat
down, and with a voice of timidity,
accompanied with a look of gratitude, in a few words,
acquainted Lady Allworth with her
story
.
My father, Madam, is an officer in the army;
my mother dying while I was yet an
insant
, my
father
married a lady in America, who brought him an
ample fortunehe took me over to America when
only eight years old, and we remained there in the
utmost
harmony till the unhappy breach between
Great Britain and her Colonies. My father
refusing
to join the Americans, his property was
confiscated
,
and he returned with his family to
England
in a
distressed
situation
.We have been in
England
seven
years; the family has been
sickly
and
expensive
my poor father was involved in debt
I could not bear the idea of adding to his expences
I left my home, which is in the country, and came
to town to a
distant
relation, in hopes, by
industry
,
to obtain a living; this relation I have
undesignedly
offended; as
also
some
who were nearer allied
my efforts to live by
industry
have failed, and I find
myself
under the
necessity
of
seeking
a
service
I had
flattered
myself
with the hopes of being engaged in
your
Ladyship
's family; but alas! I am
disappointed
in all my undertakings.
Has the woman who pretended to recommend,
got any money from you?
said
her
Ladyship
.
Indeed, Madam,
she
has got all I had.
Lady Allworth drew forth her
purse
Mariana
arose
to take her leave.
Stop a moment,
said
Lady Allworth
sit
down
againyou
must
want
some
refreshment
.
A
glass
of wine and a
biscuit
was ordered.
Call on me again in a day or two,
said
her
Ladyship
;
I will try to do
something
for you; in the
mean time accept of this trifle.
I could not
see
what
she
put into her hand; but I
am
sure
it was the manner of the giver, not the gift
itself
, that
sunk
so
deep into Mariana's heart: it was
that which made her exclaim as
she
left the
house
Dear Lady, when I forget my obligations to thee,
may I
cease
to live.
Lady Allworth kept her word, and recommended
Mariana to a Lady in
whose
family
she
remained
till ill health obliged her to quit it.
Ye fair daughters of Britain,
whose
charms are
the theme of every tongue, the admiration of every
eye, and
whose
praise
is
sounded
to the
most
distant
kingdoms, learn from the amiable behaviour of a
Lady Allworth, how to attain
those
charms which
neither time nor accident can
diminish
the
beauties
of that Lady's
person
might have rendered her
universally
admired; but it is the
goodness
of her
heart alone that could create
universal
love and
veneration
.
The FASHIONABLE FRIEND.
As
I
passed
a
house
in the
close
of the evening,
the window
shutters
being open, I
saw
a woman
sitting
by a table, her cheek
resting
upon her left hand,
and a pen in her right
she
wrotethen
paused
then wrote again: it
seemed
to be a
subject
that
required
reflection. A genteel young woman
knocked
at the doorI had time on my hands,
so
being
rather curious to be
present
at a female tete-a-tete,
I put on my ring, and when the door was opened I
entered with the
visitor
.
She was hardly
seated
, before,
observing
the
writing
apparatus,
she
says
, So my dear Ellen, you are
exercising
your fertile geniusyou are certainly a
charming girl!what would I not give to
possess
such
a talentpray, may I
see
your performance,
or will you be
so
obliging as to read it to me?
Ellen took up the paper, threw it on the
window
,
and
said
, it was only a
sonnet
not worth
looking
at
Oh, you
sad
girl? how can you mortify me
so
?
I am
sure
if the
sonnet
is the production of your
own genius it
must
be delightfulpray do let me
see
it.
If it will give you any
pleasure
,
said
Ellen, I will
read it to you;but, I
assure
you, it is but a trifle
she
took it up and read
From the day of my birth until now,
I've
still
been
accustom
'd to grief;
My mother
she
nurs'd me in woe,
Her
sorrows
admit no relief;
She lull'd me to
sleep
with her
sighs
,
Tears mix'd with the milk of her
breast
;
For oft would they
start
in her eyes,
At the
sight
of an object
distress
'd.
To feel for another man's woes,
Is a
blessing
to
British
hearts giv'n;
A
blessing
which pity
bestows
;
And pity's the daughter of heav'n.
All nature rejoic'd at her birth;
Humanity
foster
'd the child;
And when
she
appear'd upon earth,
Each virtue approvingly
smil
'd.
Oh, 'tis divine! exclaimed the
visitor
,
whose
name I found was Greenham;pray, my dear
Ellen
,
favour me with a copy of it.
Ellen
promised
to comply with her
request
.
I wonder,
said
Mrs. Greenham, why you don't
publish
your works; it is a
thousand
pities
such
charming poems as you in general write
should
be
buried in oblivion.
I
sometimes
,
said
Ellen, think I will lay
some
of
my little productions before the impartial public;
but I am quite terrified at the idea of
exposing
myself
to the ridicule of my own
sex
or the
satire
of the
other.
You are too humble, my
sweet
friend, cries Mrs.
Greenham, there is not the
least
occasion
for your
fearsI am certain your works would be
universally
read and admired; and it will be
injustice
both to
yourself
and the world, to deprive them of the
gratification
of
perusing
them, and
yourself
of the
same
you would certainly acquire and undoubtedly
deserve
.
It is rather
surprising
, thought I, that one woman
should
be
so
liberal in the
praises
of another.I
looked intently in Mrs. Greenham's face; and
methought
I read
dissimulation
in every featureI took
an attentive view of Ellen, and plainly
discovered
that
she
saw
through the thin veil of her
visitor
's
flattery; and though
she
could not but
listen
to her
with
silent
civility,
she
, in her heart,
despised
her
envy
and ill nature much
less
than the
specious
arts
with which
she
endeavoured to cover them.
When Mrs. Greenham took her leave, I
followed
her; determined to hear in what manner
she
L 2
spoke
of Ellen when
absent
from her. She went
immediately home and entertained her
husband
and
several
visitors
at the expence of the
inoffensive
Ellen
.
I found her,
said
she
,
scribbling
as
usual
: I
praised
her extravagantly, and
advised
her to
publish
her works
she
said
she
had
some
thoughts of it.
I
wish
she
would to my heart, for I
should
like to
see
her heartily laughed atI am
sure
women have
no
business
with pens in their hands, they had better
mend their cloaths, and look after their family.
And pray, why not Madam,
said
an old
gentleman
who had
listened
attentively to this loquacious
harangue, why may not a woman if
she
has
leisure
and genius, take up her pen to gratify both
herself
and friends. I am not
ashamed
to acknowledge
that I have
perused
the productions of
some
of our
female pens, with the
highest
satisfaction
; and am
happy when I find any woman has
so
large a fund
of
amusement
in her own mind. I never heard a
woman who was fond of her pen complain of the
tediousness
of time; nor, did I ever know
such
a
woman extravagantly fond of
dress
, public
amusements
,
or
expensive
gaiety; yet, I have
seen
many
women of genius prove
themselves
excellent
mothers
,
wives, and daughters.
But, Sir, replied Mrs. Greenham, the Lady in
question
only fancies
herself
possessed
of genius; her
writings are the
most
insipid
things in nature.
If I could
see
some
of them,
said
the old
gentleman
,
I
should
be a better judge.
Then you
shall
presently
, for I expect
she
will
come and
spend
an hour or two with me this
evening
,
when I can
easily
prevail with her to
shew
you
some
of her pretty
scrawls
.
Ellen
soon
after made her appearance.Mrs.
Greenham received her with a
vast
show
of
affection
,
and
soon
began a
conversation
which led to
literary
productions.
I know of nobody
so
clever in this way,
said
she
,
as my little friend Ellen heredo, my dear, oblige
the company by reciting
some
of your poems; or,
perhaps, you may have
some
in your pocketI know
you always have a
treasure
there.
Indeed Madam,
said
Ellen, I only write for
amusement
;
nor can it be
supposed
my
performances
have any merit worthy the attention of this
company
.
Oh, you are always
so
diffident
It is a
sure
sign
of merit,
said
the old gentleman.
But, pray Madam,
addressing
himself
to Ellen, do
you devote much of your time to your pen?
I am
so
situated
, Sir,
she
replied, that I am
unavoidably
obliged to
pass
many hours entirely by
myself
In
the former part of my life I have been
engaged
in many
scenes
, the remembrance of which,
in
these
solitary
hours, would be extremely painful,
were it not for the relaxation and
amusement
I find
in the
exercise
of my pen I have but few
acquaintance
,
she
continued, and even
those
few might, by
too frequent
visits
, grow tired of my company. I
seldom
go out but I meet with
some
object to
engage
my attention; and often when reflecting on
the various
scenes
around me, I fall into a train of
ideas which I feel a
sort
of
pleasure
in committing
to paper; and in general they
serve
to occupy the
next
leisure
or
solitary
hour.
And an excellent way of
spending
time too,
replied
the old gentleman.I am certain, Madam, you
are never
less
alone than when by
yourself
.
It is true, Sir,
said
she
, I do find a great deal of
entertainment from this method of employing
myself
;
but it is no
reason
for me to
suppose
,
because
I am
amused
in writing, another
person
should
be
amused
in reading what I have written.
But, I do
assure
you,
said
Mrs. Greenham, it will
give us all a great deal of
satisfaction
to hear a little
of your performance.Now do, Ellen, oblige us.
Ellen was of a temper that could not bear
entreaties
she
had not power to
refuse
a
request
made
with any tolerable degree of
sincerity
and
earnestness
.
I am always in pain for people of this
disposition
;
they often do things
absolutely
disagreeable
to
themselves
,
because
they have not
strength
of mind
to
refuse
peremptorily, but do it
so
faintly, and with
such
evident marks of pain, that a
second
or third
request
always conquers.
I know a young man of this
disposition
who is
intoxicated two or three times a week, though he
is not naturally addicted to inebriety, and in
general
suffers
exceedingly after it, merely
because
he
cannot
resist
the
earnest
importunities of his
friends.
I know a woman too, who, whenever
she
goes
into a
shop
, lays out twice as much money as
she
intended,
because
the
shop
-keeper intreats her to
have this, and that is
so
vastly
pretty, or amazingly
cheapand
she
imperceptibly launches into
extravagancies
which
she
afterwards heartily repents.
Now, though
such
a pliability of temper may be
extremely
pleasing
and agreeable in
domestic
life, it
exposes
a
person
to a
thousand
inconveniencies,
improprieties
,
and irregularities. I would have a man
or woman maintain an opinion of their own; and
when
resolved
to
refuse
a
request
which they may
judge imprudent or improper to grant,
refuse
it with
such
steadiness
and dignity as may at once prevent
their being teized into an action which their
reason
revolts
against
.
But, this is by way of
digression
,
so
I beg pardon,
and return.
Ellen, urged by the united
requests
of the
company
,
and a little female vanity which dwelt in her
own
bosom
, at length complied, and recited in a
graceful manner, a
short
, pathetic tale, written in the
elegiac
stile
, and greatly in the manner of
Shenstone
.
The old gentleman
bestowed
no
praises
on it, but
he honored the recital with a tear, and
soon
after
left the companywhen the
inoffensive
Ellen
became
a butt for the
satire
, ridicule, envy, and
ill-nature
of
those
that remained, and
whose
tongues had
only been
restrained
by his
presence
. Yet Mrs.
Greenham
professed
an unbounded
friendship
for
her, and declared there was nothing but what
she
would freely do to
serve
herbut
she
was a
fashionable
friend.
Friendship
is a word
universally
used
, but little
understood
; there are a number of people who
stile
themselves
friends, who never knew what it
was to have an anxious thought for the
person
for
whom they pretend this violent
friendship
, in the
female world in particular. I make no doubt but
there are numbers of women who,
should
they be
informed
whilst
at cards, of the
greatest
misfortune
having befallen one of their
most
intimate friends,
would cry, Poor thing, I am
vastly
sorry
I had a
great regard for herand then inquire what is
trumps? or how gows the game? I can divide the
world into five
distinct
classes
of friends, for there is
hardly any one
person
breathing but
boasts
of feeling
that exalted attachment for
some
one or other of
their fellow mortals.Among the men, is the
professing
friend and
insidious
friend; among the
women
,
the
ostentatious
, and the envious friend; and
a
small
parcel may be culled of both
sexes
and
set
under
the denomination of real friends.
The PROFESSING FRIEND.
I will
try him, however,
said
Lavinia, wiping
her eyes, for I have often heard him
say
he valued
my dear Ferdinand above all other menand
sure
he will not let him
languish
in a
prison
for the want
of
such
a trifle, and which we can
so
soon
repay
.
It was a day or two after I was in
possession
of
my ring.I had
stepped
into a
shop
to buy a pair
of gloves, when a young woman behind the
counter
addressed
these
words to her companion:
You may try him, Lavinia,
said
her companion,
but I do not think you will
succeed
;
beside
, my dear,
your
circumstances
are not
so
bad as to lead you to
fear your
husband
's confinement.
They are
worse
than you imagine, Eliza,
said
she
; we have,
besides
this bill,
several
more to pay,
which we are equally unable to provide for.Mr.
Woudbe has
professed
the
warmest
friendship
for
my
husband
, and I think he will be glad of the
opportunity
to convince him it was not merely
professional
.
I had by this time
purchased
my gloves; and
being
anxious to know how Lavinia would
succeed
in
her undertaking, I
just
left the
shop
, put on my
ring, and returned.
Lavinia had left the
shop
, and was in the parlour.
A
person
came in, who from his appearance I
should
have
supposed
a man of
fashion
; yet, I
knew him to be a mechanichis affected air and
gait
spoke
him a
finished
coxcombit was the
identical Mr. Woudbe; he
asked
for her
husband
;
he was not at homehe
sat
down, fell into
conversation
,
frequently intimated his
servent
wishes
for
their
prosperity
, and declared he
desired
nothing
more than an opportunity to convince his worthy
friend Ferdinand how much he had his
interest
and
happiness
at heart.
Lavinia's eyes beamed
pleasure
and gratitude;
she
thought it a favourable, golden opportunity
she
told him her
husband
's
circumstances
were
embarrassed
,
but the loan of eighty or an hundred pounds
would
set
them quite at
ease
; and they
should
by
industry
and oeconomy
soon
be enabled to repay it.
She pleaded with the
most
persuasive
eloquence;
love animated her countenance; an anxious tear
glittered in her eyebut the
professing
Mr.
profeing">professing
Mr.
Woud be
had none of the finer feelings which dignify the
man; he loved
ostentation
,
show
, and grandeur;
but he had no idea of any
pleasure
in life
superior
to that he felt when
dressed
in a finer coat than his
neighbour.Two guineas was not too much for a
ticket for a ball, but a
shilling
was extravagantly
thrown away in relieving the wants of a
distressed
fellow-creature.
To
such
a man, the tearful eye, the anxious
countenance
alternately red and pale, the trembling
frame, and
struggling
sigh
of Lavinia, pleaded in
vain; he heard her with indifference; he
consoled
her in language in which was an equal mixture of
pity and contempt; and I was informed by a
person
who knew him, that it was the
last
visit
he ever
paid his friend Ferdinand.
This is a
sort
of friend which the world
swarms
with
professions
cost
nothinggive me the man
whose
heart, alive to every dictate of humanity,
stays
not till he is
asked
to do a favour, but
eagerly
seeks
out opportunities to render
service
to
mankind
.
Anxious for the fate of Lavinia, a
short
time
after
,
I made another
invisible
visit
when I entered
the
house
, every thing was in
confusion
; and
Lavinia
herself
looked like Melancholy
musing
on a
scene
of woe. I was
casting
in my own mind fifty
different plans to find out the real
cause
of her
distress
,
and, if
possible
, relieve it without hurting her
feelings, by letting her know that her
necessities
were
discovered
by a
stranger
, when a little man
entered the
house
,
whose
features, however plain,
and, to the generality of the world,
uninteresting
,
immediately
prepossessed
me in his favour.
Lavinia,
said
he, I hear you are moving, and am
come to
see
if I can be of any
service
to you
where is your
husband
?
A
gush
of tears was all
she
could
answer
.
Dear girl, do not weep,
said
heis it pecuniary
matters that
distress
you?
speak
Lavinia; will
twenty
or thirty guineas be of any
service
to you?
She
hesitated
; but at
last
confessed
that they were
greatly
distressed
for money; and that her
husband
was obliged to keep out of the way of his creditors.
I will be with you again in a few moments,
said
he, darting out of the
house
.
I waited his return.
In
less
than half an hour he came back, and put a
sum
of money into Lavinia's hand, which entirely
calmed her fears.
Oh! Sir,
said
she
, how
shall
I ever return this
obligation.
By never mentioning it, he replied: let me beg it
may be buried in oblivionI
shall
be offended if
ever I hear it talked ofit gives me
pleasure
that I
had it in my power to
serve
so
worthy a man as your
husband
; and
restore
tranquility to two hearts which
were formed for love and
domestic
happiness
.
He
shook
her hand cordially and left her.
How does thy humility exalt thee, my generous
friend,
said
Lavinia, when he was gone; but actions
like thine cannot be hid; it would be an injury to
mankind to conceal themyet it is not an action to
be blazoned from the trump of common
same
, but
gratitude
shall
snatch
a gentler clarion, and tell thy
virtues to the
listening
few who know how to
admire
and imitate them.
I left her with a heart at
ease
.
It was the
close
of the evening
passing
through a
public
street
, I heard the
sound
of
music
, and
saw
a
room in an
house
of entertainment elegantly
illuminated
I
took the advantage of my ring, and
went inIt was an entertainment given at the
expence
of Mr. Woudbethe kind, the friendly, Mr.
Woudbe, was
lavishing
in folly and
dissipation
a
sum
which might have lightened the hearts of the
miserable
, and dried the tear of
despondency
But
he could not
shew
his
taste
in giving or lending
money
he
could
display
his elegant fancy by
spending
it on trifles, or, in reality, throwing it away.
The ATTORNEY.
You
must
not
lose
a moment, Sir,
said
a
foot-man
,
addressing
a man in the coffee room, whom I
knew to be an attorneyYou
must
make all
possible
haste
, for my
master
cannot live three hours.
The attorney was a tall, meagre man; had a great
deal of
servile
politeness
and outward
sanctity
in his
manner; yet there was an under
designing
cast
with
his eyes, which made me
suspect
the integrity of his
heart.
He is going to make a will,
said
Iperhaps
some
rich, old
miser
is at the point of death, and is willing
M
to
dispose
of his hoards in the
best
manner he can
I will accompany the attorney.
We were
sat
down at the door of an
handsome
house
, and I followed Mr. Vellum
unseen
into the
chamber of the
sick
man.
He appeared to be between the age of forty and
fifty; his looks were venerable, but his features were
marked by the hand of deathbehind his pillow,
supporting
his head,
sat
a lovely girl about fourteen
years old, who while
she
, with her hand, wiped away
the
sweat
which
stood
upon the forehead of the dying
man, bedewed it again with her tearsAt the foot
of the bed
stood
a youth
something
older than the
girl; he leaned
against
the
supporter
of the bed;
the curtain partly hid his face, but the part which
was
exposed
to view,
spoke
filial love, anxiety and
sorrow
.
My good friend, Mr. Vellum,
said
the
sick
man,
seebly
stretching
out his hand, I am glad you are
come: I feel the
springs
of life
almost
worn out,
and I
wish
to
settle
my worldly affairs, that my dear
Julietta and Horace may have no trouble from my
relations.
You know, Mr. Vellum, I married their mother
contrary to the inclination of my father, and on that
account, at his
decease
, found
myself
possessed
of but
a
small
patrimony: willing to provide, not only for
the
present
moment, but
also
for futurity, I entered
into
partnership
with an eminent merchant, and my
success
being beyond my hopes, I not only lived in
affluence, but am enabled to leave my beloved
children
sufficient
to place them above temptation, and
give them the exalted
pleasure
of
administering
to
the
necessities
of their fellow creaturesI have
experienced
so
much malignity and envy from my own
relations, that I think them by no means fit
guardians
for my children. My wife was poor, and an
orphan;
she
had many relations, but no friends.
Those
who will not befriend a
desolate
orphan, are
not proper people to be
entrusted
with the care and
management of young, volatile mindsYou, my
friend, have a
son
, about the age of Horace; and a
daughter
some
years older than Julietta; they will
be
sit
companions for each other. I do not think my
children can be happier than under your
guardianship
and protectionI have in the funds thirty
thousand
pounds I
desire
you will divide it equally
between
my children; and in
case
of their dying
without
issue
, it
shall
devolve to you and yoursI
shall
leave you other
testimonies
of my regard, and a
few legacies to my
servants
pray be quick, I am
hastening
toward my end
Mr. Vellum wrote the will, the old gentleman
signed
it, and two of the
servants
witnessed
it.
Mr. Vellum
seemed
greatly affected,
professed
much
esteem
for the lovely children, and declared the
whole
study
of his life
should
be to make them
happy
he
embraced, and pretended to weep over his
friend, but methought there was more of joy than
sorrow
in his tearsThe will in his
possession
gave
him greater
satisfaction
, than the death of his friend
gave him pain.
The DEPARTURE.
The
old gentleman
desiring
to be left to
himself
a few moments, the attorney and the children
withdrewHe offered up
some
pious ejaculations,
requesting
the
blessings
so
abundantly
shower
'd on
himself
might be continued to his children; his
heart overflowed with gratitude for the many
mercies
he had enjoyed; he petitioned health and
prosperity
for his friends, penitence and pardon for his
enemies, and
finished
his prayer by
servently
recommending
his
soul
to the mercy of that Being who
had guided and
supported
him through life. This
essential
duty
finished
, he again called for his
children
.
My dear Horace and Julietta,
said
he, I am
summoned
from you; early, my children, you are
berest
of the love, attention, and advice of a parent, who had
no other regard for life than as it contributed to
your
happiness
I have but one precept I with to
inculcate and
impress
upon your minds: deal by all
mankind as you
wish
and expect them to deal by
you; let nothing, my children, alienate your
affections
from each other; and remember to
respect
your brother and
sister
mortals, not according to the
homage which the
mistaken
world may think due
to wealth and grandeur, but according to their own
intrinsic
worth and merit.
Horace,
respect
virtue wherever you find it; nor
dare on any account
use
the wealth of which Heaven
has appointed you
steward
, to corrupt integrity, or
pervert innocence;
shun
the
society
of the licentious,
though dignified with titles; regard not the
scoffs
of
the libertine, but
preserve
unshaken
your integrity
to God and man.
Julietta, my beloved girl, fly from the voice of
adulation
;
beware of
insidious
villains, who
spread
their
specious
snares
for youth and innocence; guard
with
unceasing
vigilance your honor and your
same
;
yet, my dear girl, exult not in the pride of your own
virtue, nor triumph over the wretched fallen of your
sex
; be uniformly good; be innocent
yourself
, but
pity and lament the
misery
of
those
who have
forfeited
that
inestimable
jewel; pour the balm of
comfort
into their bleeding hearts, and learn from their
errors to rectify your own.
Oh, I am goingone more embraceAlmighty
Father
bless
bless
myChildren, he would have
said
, but the
ghastly
monarch
sealed
up his lips for
ever.
Oh! take me with you, dear
saint
, cried Julietta,
wildly
clasping
her hands
she
threw
herself
on the
bed and fainted.
The grief of Horace was manly, but
expressive
the tears rolled down his cheekshe walked about
the room in
silent
agonytill
seeing
his
sister
's
situation
,
he forgot his own
sorrows
, and endeavoured
to revive and comfort her.
The ORPHANS.
Lovely
children,
said
I, as I left the
house
, you
are now launched into a world full of temptations to
vice, which will approach you under the
fascinating
form of
pleasure
.May you avoid the rocks and
quick
sands
on which
so
many youths of both
sexes
are wrecked.
I do not like Mr. Vellum,
said
I, making a quick
transition
from the orphans to the guardian.I
wish
he may
discharge
his
trust
faithfully.
Hang this
suspicion
, continued I, it is an
uncharitable
,
unchristian
-like thing that has crept into my
mind under the
shape
of anxiety for the welfare of
those
poor orphans.There's another
foolish
idea
now; how is it
possible
a
person
can be poor who has
fifty
thousand
pounds to their fortune; it may
seem
an inexplicable riddle to the narrow minded race of
mortals who place the
summum
bonum
of
sublunary
happiness
in an
ostentatious
display
of wealth and
grandeur: but I can
assure
them a
person
possessed
of fifty times that
sum
, may be poor, and
so
poor as
to be
miserable
.
M 2
Impossible
, exclaims pretty
Miss
Biddy, the
tradesman
's daughter, who
just
returned from
boarding
school
, is informed by mamma that
she
is to have
five
thousand
pounds for her fortune.
Impossible
, had I ten more added to that five, I
should
be the
happiest
mortal breathingand it is
quite out of the
question
to think of ever being poor
again.
A well-a-day,
said
I, 'tis a
strange
thing; but, to
me, poverty of ideas and
meanness
of
spirit
are
greater
afflictions than poverty of
purse
and
meanness
of
birth.
When a man is alone, and in a thinking mood,
his imagination
insensibly
runs from one thing to
another, till he entirely wanders from the
subject
that
first
engaged his attention.
Now, this being my
case
, I had got into
such
a
train of thought on the various kinds of poverty with
which the world is
infested
, that it was with
difficulty
I brought my mind back to Horace and
Julietta
;
and, when I did, that
devilish
suspicion
of
their guardian's integrity would creep along with
them.
Pshaw
said
I, what
business
have I to
suspect
a
man of
baseness
, to which, perhaps, he may be an
entire
stranger
. I declare, weak mortal as I am, I
find
sufficient
employ in correcting my own errors,
without
searching
out the errors of others.
I endeavoured to give my thoughts another turn,
but in vain, they involuntarily turned back to the
orphans, and I wandered on,
musing
on the
uncertainty
of their future
happiness
.
The GIRL of the TOWN.
For
ever
cursed
be that
detested
place,
said
a
wretched daughter of folly, as
she
passed
a tavern in
Holborn; and for ever execrated be that night on
which I
first
entered it.
She caught my hand as I
passed
her.
Give me a
glass
of wine,
said
she
.
The watch had
just
gone ten.
I looked in her face
she
was pretty; and I thought
her features were not of the
sort
which never
express
shame
; her eyes were
cast
downI thought I
saw
a tear
steal
from themI touched her cheek, it was
wet, yet
she
forced a
smile
I took hold of her hand,
it was cold, it trembled.
My
compassion
was
strongly
excitedby an
involuntary
motion I drew her hand under my arm, and
walked on in
silence
till we came to another
house
of
entertainment.I then gave her
something
to
procure
refreshment
, and bade her good night.
Then you will not go in with me,
said
she
, in
tremulous
accents.
I
must
not,
said
I, I have a wife.
Go, then,
said
she
, letting go my arm. Yet, I
thought I had found a friend, and would have told
you
such
a talebut, no matterI am wretched
I have made others
so
I will not
sin
against
conviction
.
While this
lasts
,
said
she
, I will live
unpolluted
when
it is gone I
must
either
starve
or
sin
again.
Now let the icy
sons
of
philosophy
say
what they
please
. I could no more have left this poor girl after
such
a declaration, than I could travel bare-foot over
the burning
deserts
of Arabia.So, without once
asking
the advice of Madam Prudence, or
suffering
Suspicion
to hint that her affliction might be
assumed
I again took hold of her hand, and we entered the
house
together.
And now for your tale, my poor afflicted,
said
I,
after
she
had eaten an hearty
supper
of cold veal and
sallad
.
To engage your
friendship
, Sir,
said
she
, I
must
be open and candid, and often condemn
myself
I
know I
stand
convicted before the world, but the
world fees not the heart.Credulity was my fault;
a vile platonic
system
my ruin.
Yet, had I been ruined alone, it were but little
consequence
; but, alas! I have involved others in
misery
I have
sown
thorns on the conjugal pillow
of a worthy womanI have torn the heart of a
parent
with all the dreadful pangs an injured wife, a
doating mother can feel, who
sees
the
husband
of her
affections, the father of her children eagerly
pursuing
,
and encouraged in a guilty
passion
.
Gracious God, cried
she
,
clasping
her hands, let
my
sorrows
, my
miseries
, my unfeigned penitence
expiate this fault, and for the
rest
thy will be done.
I know not how it was; but, though
she
so
strongly
accused
herself
, and of
such
heinous offences,
for my
soul
I could not but pity her; and
so
did my
dear Emma too, when I told her the tale;
so
I bade
her to be comforted, and I would
serve
her in every
thing that lay in my power
But to the tale
You
shall
have it directly, good ladiesI know
you love a little private
history
.
Mercy on me! cried
Miss
Autumn, what
sort
of
a
story
are we to have now? the
history
of a filthy
creature who lived with another woman's
husband
,
and then turned
street
walker?
Even
so
, dear Madam; and if your immaculate
modesty
will be too much
shocked
at the recital in
public, double down the page, take it up into your
chamber, and read it when you are alone; it will
save
you the trouble of a
blush
And do you think, Mr.
Inquisitor
, that your
works will be proper for the
perusal
of youth?
I hope
so
, Madam; Heaven forbid that I
should
ever write a page
whose
tendency might make me
blush
to own it, or in my
latest
hour
wish
to blot it
outmy narrative is calculated to
inspire
at once
pity and horror
Pity! good LordI never heard the likepity
for an abandoned
hussey
who merits the
most
flagrant
punishment
?
You'll pardon me, Madam, if I differ from you
in opinionI would have every woman to feel a
proper horror and
detestation
of the crimes this
unhappy
girl has committed; but, at the
same
time,
pity the
weakness
that led her into them, and the
miseries
the
commission
of them has entailed upon her.
I have no patience, Sir; I
insist
upon it, that the
breach of
chastity
in woman
deserves
the
most
rigorous
punishment
.
Unfeeling woman! if thou art really virtuous
thyself
,
boast
not thy
superiority
over thy afflicted,
fallen
sisters
; but retire to thy
closet
, and thank thy
Creator that he gave thee not a form that might lead
thee into temptations, or endued thee with fortitude
to
withstand
them
But now for Annie's
story

INQUISITOR;

INVISIBLE RAMBLER.

VOLUME III.
ANNIE's STORY.
It
was on a fine evening, the latter end of May,
when tired with the fatigues of the day, for
she
was
a milliner's apprentice, Annie obtained leave of her
mistress
to walk out for a little air.Her
mistress
had a
shop
which
she
occupied, and frequently
visited
during the
summer
season
,
situated
on the banks
of the Thames.
Annie
strayed
toward the water
side
. Some
venerable
trees grew on the banks, forming a covert
from the
sun
at noon; and, by their interwoven
branches,
inspiring
a
sort
of
pleasing
melancholy in
the gray twilight of the evening.
Annie was a
sentimental
girl
she
loved
solitude
,
poetry, and
music
.With a mind
softened
by the
remembrance of
some
former occurrences of her life,
and
spirits
calmed, but not
depressed
, by the
solemn
silence
and
serenity
of every thing around her,
she
wandered on, meditating on the happy
state
of
those
who were in a
situation
to enjoy
unmolested
the
darling
pleasures
of reading, meditation, and
friendship
.
Whether love had any
share
in her thoughts at
that moment, I never could get her to
consess
but,
whether a
sentimental
young woman, wandering in
a
solitary
walk, and contemplating the works of
nature
,
might not naturally enough
wish
for a
bosom
friend to participate in her
pleasures
, and join in an
innocent
conversation
, I leave to my fair readers to
determineto be
sure
,
she
might
wish
for a female
companion; very likely
she
did; but it is a point I
never could determine.
In this
shady
walk Annie was
accosted
by Mr.
Winlove.
Mr. Winlove was a gentleman of fortune, to
whose
family Annie had been recommended by a
particular friend as an innocent, well-
disposed
girl.
She frequently
visited
Mrs. Winlove
she
had
received
numberless
civilities from her
husband
there could be no harm in walking two or three turns
with a married man
she
accepted his proferred
arm, and they proceeded together.
I had been
wishing
for an agreeable companion
in this walk, Annie,
said
he.
Why did you not bring Mrs. Winlove with you?
'Tis a natural
question
; Annie, but a wife is not
always the
most
agreeable companion. I am much
better
pleased
with your company than I
should
be
with hers
Annie had been brought up in the
strictest
principles
of virtue;
she
had
likewise
imbibed
some
strange
,
obsolete
notions concerning honor, piety,
integrity, and the like. She, therefore, thought it
strange
that a man
should
prefer the company of an
indifferent
person
, to that of the woman to whom he
had vowed eternal love and
constancy
.
How can you talk
so
inconsistently
, Mr.
Winlove
?
said
she
;
surely
my company cannot be
preferable
to that of the woman of your choice.
Do people never marry from any other motives
than inclination?
N
I have heard, indeed,
said
Annie, of marriages
of
interest
, where avarice, not love, lighted the
hymeneal
torch; but I have too good an opinion of
Mr. Winlove to think he could be
biassed
by
so
sordid
a motive.
How I am delighted to find that you entertain
so
high an opinion of me, my dear creature; and
yet it pains me.
Oh, why am I denied the power of
bestowing
myself
and fortune on a woman every way
so
amiable.
Annie was going to interrupt him, but he
stopped
her, and proceeded.
Be not offended, my
sweet
angel, you have no
idea of the
miseries
of my
situation
; drawn into a
cursed
connection with a woman who has neither
beauty, merit, nor
accomplishments
to render her
a
desirable
companiona woman for whom I have
not the
least
tenderness
, and whom I married from
a
mistaken
point of honorunhappy wretch that I
am, I
must
now daily
see
you, charming Annie,
lovely, amiable,
accomplished
, yet obliged to earn
a
subsistence
, when nature formed you to move in a
sphere
more exalted, more
suited
to your gentle
disposition
.
These
hands, dear girl, were not
formed
for labourhe took one hand and
pressed
it
tenderly
to his lips.
Now, however Annie might be inclined to
reprove
Mr. Winlove in the beginning of this
address
,
the latter part of it was
so
prettily mixed
with
praises
of
herself
, that
she
could not well
determine
whether to be
pleased
or offended
she
therefore continued
silent
.
Annie was the daughter of a merchant; had
been well educated; and being
supposed
to have a
large fortune, was early introduced into the
school
of gallantry, and her ears invaded by the voice of
adulation
she
was prettyhow could
she
avoid
knowing it?
she
had heard an hundred different
men
swear
it; her
glass
confirmed their oaths.
She was naturally
sensible
; but
she
was vain, and a
little inclined to cequetry.Her father died
insolvent
she
was taken from a
scene
of grandeur, and
apprenticed to a milliner.She was good-natured;
every body loved her
she
submitted
to her fate
without repining, and endeavoured to render
herself
useful
in her new occupation.But, alas! poor
Annie,
she
loved the
soft
numbers of a Dryden or
a Pope, much better than the
study
of the
fashions
;
and would prefer
spending
an hour at her pen,
before
the formation of the
most
elegant ornament for
the
person
.
It is not to be wondered at that
she
was
delighted
by the voice of flattery,
since
she
had
seldom
,
from her cradle, been
accustomed
to any other.
Mr. Winlove was artful; he
easily
discovered
the method by which he might gain the good will
of this
simple
girl; and imperceptibly changed the
subject
, from admiring the beauties of her
person
,
to commend the graces of her mind.He then
inquired
into the nature of her
studies
; commended
her
taste
in the
selection
of authors; ventured
gently
to laugh at her ideas of religion; called them
superstitious
;
said
she
was a novice in the ways of
the world, and openly avowed a
passion
for her.
At
first
her looks plainly indicated her horror and
amazementShe trembled
shrunk
from him,
and telling him
she
was
shocked
to find the
person
she
had
supposed
her friend, was her
bitterest
enemy
,
burst
into tears.
Had Annie acted with propriety
she
would have
instantly
left him; but he attempted to palliate his
offence
she
staid
to hear him.
How can you call me your enemy, dear Annie,
said
hethough I doat on you
almost
to
madness
,
I would not injure you to obtain an empire. I
will curb my
passion
; it
shall
be pure, exalted
friendship
that warms our
bosoms
; we may be
friends, my
sweet
girl; you cannot
resuse
me that
token of your
esteem
.
Let your actions teach me to
esteem
you, Mr.
WinloveI will be the friend of no man who
pretends
to laugh at all obligations moral and
religious
.
Mr. Winlove by degrees led her into a
dispute
Annie was not a match in argument with this
insidious
friend; he was a
sophist
; he preferred the
laws of nature; called religion
priestcraft
; brought
innumerable proofs to convince her that her
opinion
was fallacious, and that
she
was entirely
ignorant
of the road to
happiness
, if
she
supposed
it was
to be found by
strictly
adhering to the
musty
rules
prescribed
by the aged and captious, who, unable
any longer to enjoy the
pleasures
of youth, would
deprive others of their
share
.
Take example, dear Annie,
said
he, from the
excellent
Eloise
of Rouffeau.
She had never read it.
He recommended it very
strongly
for her
perusal
.
As
she
returned home,
passing
a library, Mr.
Winlove
purchased
the pernicious novel, and gave
it to Annie.
She took it home
she
read ither judgment
was perverted
she
believed in the reality of a
platonic
passion
she
thought
she
had the virtue of
an
Eloise
, and Mr. Winlove the honor of a St.
Preux.
Churchill was the next author that was
recommended
.
She read
she
listened
to the
soft
language of
love, and imbibed pernicious
poison
from every
page
she
read, and every word
she
heard.
Trusting
to her own
strength
and virtue,
she
made a private
assingnation
met him
confessed
she
loved himand was
lost
.
But little now remains to be told.
A few months convinced her, that when honor
is forfeited, love cannot
exist
.
Mr. Winlove
forsook
her.
Her reputation
stained
without friends
without
peace
despised
and
insulted
by her own
sex
,
pitied by the other, and renounced by her uncle,
who had bound her apprentice,
she
became the
associate
of the abandoned and profligate; and
reduced
to
chuse
the dreadful alternative of death or
infamy, became a partner in vices which once
she
would have
shuddered
but to think on.
LOVE.
And
this man pleaded love as an incitement to
the ruin of the poor,
simple
Annie.
What is love?
It is a
question
which would be
answered
different
ways, according to the age and
situation
of the
person
to whom it is
addressed
Love! cries the
lively girl,
whose
imagination is warmed by the
perusal
of a
sentimental
novellove is the cordial
drop Heaven has thrown in, to
sweeten
the bitter
draught of lifewithout love we can only
exist
sweet
soother
of our cares! that can
strew
roses
on.
N 2
the
coarsest
bed, and make the
most
homely fair
delicious.Give me love and Strephon, an
humble
cottage
shaded
with woodbine; for love will
render the retreat delightful!
Charmed with the enchanting
scene
her
busy
fancy
draws,
she
imagines
happiness
exists
only in a
cottage; and that for the love of her dear
Strephon
,
she
could
easily
, and without regret, forego
all the indulgencies of her father's
house
; all the
advantages of wealth, and
solace
herself
with a
brown
crust
and a pitcher of milk. But then her
Strephon will always be near her, ever
whispering
his love, and
studying
to promote her felicity: fired
with
these
romantic ideas,
she
takes the
first
opportunity
of quitting her home; and without a
moment's deliberation, throws
hersels
upon the
honor
of a man, who, perhaps, had no further regard
for her than the hope of
sharing
her fortune might
excite.
Ask
this
same
woman,
some
few months after,
when poverty has
visited
her dwelling, and
umasked
the real
designs
of her
husband
,
ask
her then
what love isher
answer
will be, it is a
foolish
,
headstrong
passion
,
whose
pleasures
exist
merely in
imagination; a blind hood-winked deity, who
leads on his votaries by
promises
of
everlasting
felicity
;
and when too late for retreat,
discovers
his
real
aspect
, and plunges them into inevitable
misery
.Yet
this woman's ideas of love were both
erroneousthe
reason
of which was,
she
had never
really felt the effects of that exalted
passion
.
Ask
the libertine what is love?
Innocence trembles at his
answer
; religion and
virtue replies, it is ruin, infamy and
shame
.
The old, avaricious, captious wretch will tell
you, there is no
such
thing as love; that it never
existed
but in romances, plays, and novels.
Then pray, Mr.
Inquisitor
, what is your
opinion
of love?
The ANSWER.
Real
love was born of Beauty,
nursed
by
Innocence
,
and its life prolonged by good
sense
,
affability
and prudenceit
consists
of a
strict
union of
soul
and parity of
sentiment
between two
persons
of different
sexes
its
constant
attendants are
honor
,
integrity, candour, humility, good nature, and
chearfulness
.
A
passion
of this kind elevates the
soul
, and
inspires
it with fortitude to bear the various
vicissitudes
of life without complainingfrom
such
a
passion
proceeds all the endearing ties of nature
Father, brother,
husband
, wife, mother, daughter;
names, the very
sound
of which will make every
fibre of the heart vibrate with
pleasure
.
What noble,
praise
-worthy actions have men
performed when animated by the
esteem
and love
of a
deserving
object; even women have forgot the
weakness
of their
sex
, and
suffered
hardships
,
combated
perils, and braved even the threats of war, for
the
sake
of a beloved
husband
.It opens the heart
to all the gentle virtues which ornament
society
the heart
susceptible
of love is never callous to the
feelings of humanity; he never beholds a
distressed
object but he immediately
wishes
to relieve it, not
that he feels
so
much for the
person
's
suffering
as
for
those
who may
suffer
with or for their
distress
,
such
as a wife,
husband
, or parent.It is a
passion
which, when
inspired
by virtue, and guided by
religion
and
reason
, dignifies mankinda
passion
which ornaments the
highest
station
, and adds new
lustre
even to the
British
diadem.
Illustrious
pair!
whose
every action tends to
point the way to real
happiness
; long, long may
you reign the pride and
blessing
of your people
May your bright example
spread
throughout the
kingdom, till Hymen, led by Love and Honor,
shall
reign triumphant o'er the
British
nation.
It is very extraordinary, but I never can
finish
with the
subject
I begin uponI began a definition
of Love, and I ramble immediately to the King
and Queen; and how was it
possible
I could do
otherwise when love and harmony was the theme.
My fair country-women, you
whose
hearts are
formed by nature open to every gentle, generous
sentiment
, beware of Lovethere are many
deceivers
who
assume
his appearance, and
steal
unsuspected
into the heart; but of all the various
shapes
it
assumes
, none is
so
much to be dreaded as
the
specious
mask
of
friendship
.There has been
more women
lost
through platonic love than any
other; and the
reason
is, they are thrown entirely
off their guard, and have not the
least
doubt of the
strength
of their own virtue, or their lover's honor,
till both are forfeited
past
redemption.
But all this is
digressing
from Annie's
story
.
The SEQUEL.
When
she
had
finished
her relation I took her
into a hackney coach, and conveyed her home
candidly told my dear Emma the
circumstance
of
our meeting, and
asked
her advice in what manner
to
dispose
of the poor girl.
We tried her penitence; found it
sincere
; and
willing to encourage her in virtue, recommended
her to the
service
of a lady
whose
example confirmed
those
sentiments
which were newly returning to be
inmates of Annie's
bosom
.
I have frequently
seen
her
since
, and experience
a
thousand
times more
satisfaction
in the reflection
that I have
snatched
her from infamy, than the man
of
pleasure
can feel who
raises
the object of his
guilty
pursuit
from the
lowest
station
, to affluence
and grandeur.
That is but a bad
comparison
neither; the two
actions cannot come in competition with each
other,
since
the
first
elevates human nature, the
latter
debases
it.
The JOURNEY.
I have
often been
surprised
to find that
persons
who are
possessed
of elegant villas, and are at
liberty
to
dispose
of their time as they think proper,
should
prefer
spending
it in London. For my own
part I
should
hardly
pass
one month of the twelve
in that
seat
of commerce and
bustle
, were it not for
unavoidable obligations.
I find the
purest
pleasures
arise
from a walk in a
pleasant
meadow, hedged round with hawthorn, in
a
sweet
May morning, when the lark attunes her
early
song
, and chants forth the
praises
of her
Creator
;
to
see
bright Phbus leave his watery bed
and
kiss
away Aurora's pearly tears which hang
upon the opening flowers.
Drive on,
said
I to the
postillion
, I long to be at
my journey's end, and I
must
positively
dine at
Friendly Hall to-day.
Pray, your honor, give me
some
halfpence,
said
a boy that ran out of a cottage as the carriage
passed
.
He was an arch-looking boy, with curly hair,
very decently
dressed
, and ran along by the
side
of
the carriage with
surprising
agility.I threw him
out
some
halfpence; and looking out of the
window
to
observe
him pick them up, I
saw
a young
man who had greatly the appearance of a
gentleman
,
eagerly take the money from the child,
and go into the cottage.
I had
scarcely
mentioned the
circumstance
to my
Emma, before the
postillion
driving
carelessly
over
a heap of
stones
, one of the wheels gave way, and
down came the coach.
At another time I
should
undoubtedly have
sworn
at the
postillion
, and thrown
myself
into a
violent
passion
from which I might not have
recovered
the whole day.At
present
, as there was no
harm done, the accident only coincided with my
wishes
, which led me towards the cottage;
so
helping my Emma out, and taking Harriet in one
hand and Lucy in the other, we walked into the
humble habitation.
The COTTAGERS.
The
young man was
seated
by a woman
whose
face had never been remarkable for beauty, but was
irresistibly
charming, over
shadowed
by
melancholy
,
and adorned by
sensibility
.Her fine
auburn
hair
she
had endeavoured to confine under a
small
lawn cap, but it had broke from its bandage,
and played in wanton ringlets round her face.
A child about three months old was at her
breast
,
and the boy to whom I had given the halfpence,
was making boats with bits of wood, and
swimming
them in a pail of water that
stood
in a
corner
of the room.
As we entered, the young man glanced his eyes
upon his cloaths; his cheeks
assumed
a
sanguine
hue.They certainly were thread-bare; but what
of that? they had once been new, and from what
remained we could
see
they had once been elegant;
perhaps it was that very
circumstance
which
distressed
him.
Whatever
circumstances
a
person
is in, you may
always
discover
by their behaviour whether they
have been innured to their
situation
from
childhood
.A
person
who has never known any thing
but poverty,
shews
no other mark of chagrin at the
entrance of a
stranger
than what proceeds from an
aukwardness
of manner which they ever betray
when in the company of their
superiors
and
raise
that
person
to the
most
exalted
station
, and you
will
still
perceive the
same
disgusting
aukwardness
and
rusticity
.So, place a man of education in
ever
so
obscure
a
situation
, you will always
discover
the manners of the gentleman, though
obscured
by the garb of the beggar.
I, therefore, no
sooner
beheld the young man
than I
discovered
that he had not always worn a
thread-bare coat, or lived from his childhood in a
cottage.
The EMBARRASSMENT.
I am
hungry, mamma,
said
Harriet.
Could you procure us a little bread and milk,
said
I, to the young woman.
We have none in the
house
, Sir,
she
replied,
visibly
embarrassed
; and it is above two miles to
another cottage.
The young man turned pale as
ashes
.
Give me my money, mother,
said
the boy, and
I will go and buy
some
.
She
hesitated
, and the boy proceeded.
I think it is time we had
some
breakfast
I am
sure
I am hungryand
so
are youI heard you
say
so
, or I
should
not have begged of the
gentlefolks
.
He will
discover
our poverty,
said
the father,
forcing a
smile
.The mother turned from us
and wept.
Pardon me, Madam,
said
Emma, if I
ask
the
cause
of your tearsit is not
curiosity
, but a
wish
to
serve
you
occasions
the
question
.
Pride and poverty, replied the young man,
struggling
to
suppress
his emotions.
Will this relieve you,
said
I, offering him a few
guineas.
Though I am
almost
starving
,
said
he, I feel
more
anguish
than
satisfaction
at the offer; nor
would I accept it but for my wife and
children
.
It is extraordinary that there is
such
an innate
pride implanted in the mind of
some
men that they
are
ashamed
of poverty, though it was entailed
upon them by unavoidable misfortunes; and I am
certain that people of this
cast
, in receiving
favours
,
though perhaps
those
favours
raise
them from
a
state
of penury to plenty, feel a larger
share
of
pain than
pleasure
the noble mind is always
pained when labouring under the weight of
obligations
.
Now,
shame
upon the world for
occasioning
thiswere it not that there is greater
respect
paid
to the gilded equipage, glaring liveries, and
embroidered
cloaths, than to the poor atom of clay
that is attended by all this pomp, a man would
never
blush
at poverty when it was attended by honor
and virtue.
I do not mean hereditary honor, I mean a
nobleness
of
soul
, an elevation of
sentiment
, an integrity
of heart, that would rather bear the laugh of the
world for keeping within the
strict
rules of
conomy
than
suffer
a
tradesman
's bill to go unpaid, or
a fellow creature to want
sustenance
.
A man of real honor will not always draw his
sword
at every trivial offence; but he ever
stands
forth the undaunted champion of innocence and
virtuehe
also
holds his friend's wife or daughter
as
sacred
, regards them with
esteem
, and treats
them with
respect
.
The modern man of honor is quite a different
creature; he
must
have his
pleasures
whether he
can afford to pay for them or not; he will
steal
his
friend's fortune at the gaming table; debauch his
wife, or
ensnare
his daughter, and then run him
through the body by way of reparation.
And, what is hereditary, honor?A word of
pompous
sound
a toya playthinga pretty
bauble
for children of twenty, thirty, aye, up to an
hundred years of age.
O
I have
seen
those
great babies as
pleased
with
enumerating
the titles of their
ancestors
, as an infant
has been with a new rattle, or a jack in the box.
Sir, my forefathers were Earls, or Dukes, or
Princes.Sir, I have noble blood in my veins,
which has flowed uncontaminated through twenty
generations.
Yes, Sir, but your
ancestors
were cruel, or
unjust
,
or ambitious, or avaricious, or proud, or
revengeful
.But
they were Earls, or Dukes, or Princes.
That is the convincing argument; and my Lord
sits
down perfectly contented with the reflection
that he is right honorable by birth, and never gives
himself
the trouble to perform one honorable action
during the whole
course
of his life.
And, pray what has this to do with the
cottagers
.
Faith I don't know that it has the
least
connection
with them; but I never can
prescribe
rules for
my pen, any more than I can confine my thoughts
to one
single
object.To write
straight
forward, is
like an hackney
horse
that,
setting
out from the
first
stage
, continues in the beaten track till he arrives
at the end of his journeyfor my part I hate
such
insipid
travelling; mine is a journey of
pleasure
,
and I will turn out of the road as often as I
please
totake a view of any thing
amusing
or entertaining.
The STEWARD.
The
young man went out and procured
some
refreshment
, of which we partook, and, after the
repast
was
finished
, the wife prepared to give us her
own and
husband
's
history
.
She laid her infant to
sleep
,
set
her apartment in
proper order; and, having
set
a mug of cyder (which
her
husband
had brought in) upon the table,
sat
down to gratify the
curiosity
she
had
so
strongly
excited.
At that
instant
a fat old man rode up to the door,
dismounted
,
fastened
his
horse
to a tree, and
entered
.
I never
cast
my eye upon a
stranger
but I
immediately
form
some
idea of his or her
dispositions
by
the turn of their eyes and
cast
of their features; and
though my
skill
in
physiognomy
is not infallible, I
seldom
find
myself
deceived.
The old man had a
sort
of
haughtiness
in his
carriage, which
seemed
the
result
of mean pride and
self
-
sufficiency
; his
person
was
coarse
, his manner
rude, his language
almost
insulting
.
I am
surprised
,
said
he, to the young man, that
you have not brought me your
last
half year's rent
I have repeatedly
sent
, and will no longer be put
off by your trifling
excuses
I am now come for
the money, and will not depart without it.
Sir,
said
the young man, we have it not; and to
add to our misfortunes, two days
since
our cattle
was
seized
for a
small
sum
which we owed in the
neighbourhood.
Money I want, and money I will have,
said
the
mana large
sum
is to be made up this week, and
I will not wait any longerif you do not
send
me
the rent within two days, I will turn you out of the
cottage,
first
seizing
what
stock
you have.
Confound this money,
said
I; it is the
occasion
of more ill will and diffention than any thing
else
in the world.
Why, pray, young man,
said
he, what would
you
do without money?
I was
dressed
very plainly
so
was Emma and
the childrenhe had not
seen
the carriage that was
repairing; or if he had, he could never have
supposed
it was mine.
He
addressed
me, therefore, by this familiar
epithet
,
on account of his
supposed
superiority
; and
as he pronounced the words
young man
, he
assumed
such
an air of
self
-
sufficiency
, and
sat
himself
back
in the chair with
such
an
insulting
assurance
, that
I had hardly patience to
answer
him calmly.
If there was no money in the world,
said
I, there
would be no extortion: and, I fancy then, you, my
good friend, would find but little employment.
One of my
servants
then informed me that the
carriage was readyI enquired of my young
host
if this was his landlord, and was informed he was
only
steward
to Lord M: I became
answerable
for the rent, and determined, on my return to
town, to pay a
visit
to his
Lordship
, and inform him
of the
necessitous
situation
of his tenants.
The AUTHOR.
One
evening as I was rambling out, I
observed
a man
sitting
on the trunk of an old tree, with a
paper and pencil in his hand; at
first
I
supposed
him to be drawing, but, on a nearer approach, I
found him to be writing.
Pray, Sir,
said
I, advancing, and paying him the
compliments of the evening, what may be the
subject
which
so
agreeably engages your attention?
I
presume
you are
sacrificing
at the
shrine
of the
Muses
I am, Sir,
said
he,
rising
and putting the
paper in his pocketI have been writing all this
summer
, and in the winter I hope to have my
works in printIt is a novel, Sir, entirely
calculated
to
amuse
In how many volumes?
Two.
And are you
sure
of
selling
them?
I am engaged, Sir, to write for a
person
who
scarcely
ever
publishes
any thing but novels.
What may be the plot or foundation of your
novel
?
It is called
Annabella;
or
Suffering Innocence
my heroine is beautiful,
accomplished
, and rich;
an only child, and
surrounded
by admirers
she
contracts an attachment for a man, her inferior in
point of birth and fortune; but honorable,
handsome
,
&c.She has a female friend to whom
she
relates all that
passes
in her
breast
her hopes, fears,
meetings, partings, &c.She is treated hardly by
her friendscombats innumerable difficulties in
the
sentimental
way, but at
last
overcomes them all,
and is made the bride of the man of her heart.
Pshaw
,
said
I, that is
stale
; there are at this
present
day above two
thousand
novels in
existence
which begin and end exactly in the
same
way
the novel writers have now taken another road;
and, if you will give me leave, I will
just
give you
a few hints which may, perhaps, be of
some
service
to you in writing a novel in future.
Sketch of a Modern Novel.

person
.
There, Sir,
said
I, there you have the
substance
of a narrative which might be
spun
out to two or
three volumesthere has been many novels
introduced
to the public built on as
slender
a foundation
as that  The Modern Fine Gentleman,
Deserted
Bride, Clara and
The INTERRUPTION.
I have
often been
surprised
,
said
the author,
taking the
sketch
(for I had wrote it down) and
giving
me a bow of thanks  It has often
surprised
me,
said
he, to find that all the
distresses
of a novel
proceeds
from a
passion
which is in general
supposed
to
contribute to our chief
happiness
All writers of
that
sort
of production, from the time of romance
and enchanted tales, to the
present
tribe of
scribblers
,
could find no other
subject
to employ their
pons but love  I wonder that the novel readers are
not tired of reading one
story
so
my times, with
only the variation of its being told different ways.
When I
first
commenced Author, continued he,
I wrote on religion and
philosophy
; but I found in
the
first
I could gain no reputation
unless
I wrote
in the
enthusiastic
stile
of a
Methodist
; and the
latter was too
obstruse
a
study
for the young and gay,
required too much time for the old, and was totally
improper for the ignorant and illiterate  My books
would not fell  I had frequently applied to a
person
eminent for his numerous publications. He told
me if I
wished
to get a living I
must
write to
amuse
rather than
instruct
the world; and that if I would
write him a good novel in two volumes, he would
give me ten guineas for it.
He thought, no doubt, ten guineas was a very
large
sum
to be put into the hands of a poor author:
to deal candidly, I
should
have been very glad at
that time of a fifth part of the
sum
but to proceed
I was not at all
conversant
in that
sort
of
reading
;
but finding it
absolutely
necessary
, I borrowed
some
of the
best
esteemed
modern novels from a
library
,
and began to
peruse
them with great
attention
,
but there was a
sameness
in the generality of
them that
disgusted
, and a
looseness
in the language
of others that
shocked
me.
It is indeed
shocking
,
said
I, to
see
so
many reams
of paper expended in
ushering
to the world
pernicious
pages, which tend to vitiate the
taste
and
corrupt
the heart. When the heroine of a novel is
represented
as flying in the face of filial duty,
eloping
,
running into the very lap of danger, braving
the authority of her parents, and forgetting the
decorum
and delicacy which ought to be the
characteristic
of the female
sex
, and yet, in the end meets
with every
blessing
, every comfort,
she
can
wish
;
is it not enough to ruin the weak head and unwary
heart, by leading them to think true felicity is to
be found by following the bent of their own
inclinations
,
though never
so
wayward and
opposite
to
the advice of their friends or the dictates of
reason
?
Nor can I think that the more modern
productions
contain a better moral,
since
the whole merit of
the filial obedience is cancelled by the retaining an
affection for one man after they have vowed
eternal
fidelity to another.
I would
wish
the authors of
those
works to
reflect
,
that it is the inclinations of the heart that
renders
us guilty as much as the actual
commission
of
a crime; and a woman who
strays
from her
husband
only in
wishes
and thoughts, is in reality as
culpable as
she
who actually wounds his honor.
I have very nice notions of conjugal fidelity and
filial duty, and
earnestly
wish
that no writings might
ever be made public which tend to injure either:
they are the foundation on which we may always
raise
the temple of
happiness
; they are a crown of
glory for the head, a cordial and comforter even to
the
sorrow
-wounded heart.
These
virtues are the
brightest
ornaments the
female
sex
can wear, they make the
plainest
woman
lovely; and, when
displayed
in an eminent degree,
elevate the human
soul
, and make it little inferior
to angels.
The FAIR MANIAC.
I was
proceeding in this manner, when a
lovely
young creature darted out of a little cottage, as
we were
passing
, and
seized
me by the arm, eagerly
desired
I would convey her back to her friends.
They
say
I am mad,
said
she
: but I am not, I
have my
reason
as well as they have; I know I am
miserable
, and have been
so
ever
since
they took
my brother from me.Oh! cruel to tear him
from my arms, to break my very heart
strings
, and
send
him away, never, never to returnhe went on
the treacherous oceanYes, yes, the
sea
, the
sky
,
all, all combined with my inhuman guardian to take

I, you

, and will

Oh no!
said
she
,
crossing
her hands upon her
bosom
, and
sitting
down upon the ground.Oh
no! he will never return to me; he will never

Horace!
said
I, looking more intently at her
It was poor Juliettathen Vellum was a villain.
At the name of Vellum
she
started
from the
ground, appeared terrified, looked wildly round
her, and uttering a feint exclamation, ran
hastily
into the cottage.
I bade the author a good night and followed her
but an old woman, who I found was her only
attendant, could give me no information
concerning
her; only that
she
had
lost
her
senses
ever
since
the death of her brother, who was
shipwrecked
as he was going abroad to
finish
his
education
,
and that
she
had been
sent
into the
country in hopes that the air would be of
service
to
her.
I found my heart
so
deeply engaged by the
miserable
situation
of this lovely orphan, that it was
with difficulty I
restrained
my tears when I
pressed
her cold hand and bade her good night.
The MENDICANT.
Though
it was near three years
since
I had
been a
witness
to the
sorrow
of Julietta, on the
death of her father, yet the
scene
still
remained
sresh
in my memoryI remembered the doubts I
then entertained of Vellum's integrity, and was
determined immediately to return to town and
search
into the
mystery
of Horace's death, and the
shocking
privation of Julietta's
senses
.
When I have once formed a
resolution
, I am
not long in putting it in execution.
The morning after my arrival tn town, I
determined
to pay Mr. Vellum an
invisible
visit
.
As I was proceeding through a very public
street
, I
saw
a
servant
, in livery, feeding a fine dog
with bits of
roast
meat, which appeared perfectly
fresh
and good.A poor woman,
whose
tattered
garb
spoke
extremity of poverty,
whose
emaciated
frame
seemed
tottering on the verge of eternity,
and
whose
head was
sprinkled
over with hoary
frost
, approached the man, and in the
humblest
manner intreated him to let her pick up a little of
the victuals which he had thrown to the animal
only one bit, Sir,
said
she
, to
save
me from
starving
The
servant
was
silent
she
took it for
consent
,
and bent forward to pick up what the dog
seemed
to
refuse
.
The
servant
, who, unmoved, had heard her
request
,
no
sooner
saw
her attempt to gather up the
broken
scraps
, than he
stepped
eagerly to hen,
Inatched them from her, and with
sacrilegious
hand
struck
the wretched mortal,
whose
sex
, age,
and poverty,
should
have kept her
sacred
from
insult
.
Good Heavens!
said
I, that a man
should
so
far forgot
himself
.What!
must
the brute
creation
enjoy
ease
and plenty, while an unhappy
human
being wanders through the
streets
perishing
with hunger!and what
must
this poor woman
suffer
at
seeing
herself
denied the fragments that
are rejected by a brute? for the dog had
absolutely
left a large part of the food that had been given
him.
Who does that dog belong to?
said
I to the
servant
?
Lord M,
said
he.
Lord M,
said
I, at that
instant
recollecting
the unhappy cottagersthen why not pay Lord
Ma
visit
now, as well as at any other time;
it will only defer my intended inquiry at Mr.
Vellum's a few hours longer.
It was no
sooner
thought on than determined;
and having inquired of the
servant
in which
house
his
Lordship
resided
, I put on my ring,
ascended
the
steps
, and patiently waited the opening of the
door.
The PEOPLE of FASHION.
I chose
to make this
visit
invisible
, that I
might be the better able to judge of the
sentiments
and
disposition
of his
Lordship
.
Having got admittance into the
house
unperceived
,
I followed a
servant
who was going up
slairs
with the
breakfast
apparatus, though it was
then 1 o'clock.
On entering a room, I
saw
a woman in an
elegant
dihabille
, lolling on a
sofa
, and turning over
an enormous heap of complimentary cardsShe
was between forty and fiftywas finely formed,
and had once been
handsome
, if one might judge
from a regular
set
of features; but at
present
her
skin
was
shrivelled
and yellow, her eyes
sunk
and
languid.
Thomas,
said
she
to the
servant
, is my Lord
stirring
?
Yes, my Lady.
Go with my compliments, and I
should
be glad
of his company to
breakfast
.
In a few moments my Lord entered, threw
himself
into an
easy
chair, yawned, and drawled out
the compliments of the morning.
Where were you, my Lord,
last
night? I was
quite
surprised
at not
seeing
you at Lady
Blackace's
all
the world was there.
It is quite a
bore
, my Lady, to
see
a man and
his wife at the
same
place.
Very true, my Lord; but had your
Lordship
appeared I
should
certainly have been
so
polite as
to have made my exit.
A propos
, my LordI
wonder what has become of that fond fool, Charles
Howard, and how he and I
sabella
like matrimony
with the
sour
sauce
of povertyGood God!
continued
she
, I wonder how any body can think
of
swallowing
that bitter pill without having it
sufficiently
gilded over.
A
servant
entered, and announced Mr.
Howard
.
P
Mr. Howard! cried my Lady,
staring
up with
astonishment
,
surely
you
mistake
; my brother has
been dead above
these
seven
years; and Charles
cannot think of coming.
The gentleman certainly
sent
up the name of
Howard,
said
the
servant
.
He was bid to
shew
him up.
The FATHER.
An
elegant, elderly gentleman
soon
entered the
room,
dressed
in the military habithe paid his
respects
politely to my Lordadvanced to the
Lady
with a look of
tenderness
, and embraced her.
You are, no doubt,
surprised
to
see
me,
sister
,
said
he, after having
supposed
me dead
so
many
years; but your
surprise
will be converted into
joy when I inform you during the
last
seven
years
of my
absence
I have accumulated a large
sortune
,
and am now come to reclaim my
son
, and return
the
kindness
and
generosity
with which you
stepped
forward, and offered him your favour and
protection
during the time when my duty forced me
to be
absent
from my native countryYou, my
dear Lord and Lady M, took my poor boy
when he had no inheritance but poverty.
During the time the old gentleman was
delivering
these
words Lady M's countenance
underwent
several
changes, and at
last
settled
in a deadly
palethe fond father
instantly
saw
the change, and
asked
in a voice
scarcely
audible, whether his child
was dead?
No, Captain Howard,
said
my Lord, he is not
dead, but he has behaved
so
ill of late, that he has
entirely forfeited my favour; he has voluntarily
absented
himself
from my
house
; and to
confess
the
truth, I have not
seen
him
these
six
years, nor do I
know where he is.
And what has he done?
asked
the
distracted
father
.
He has behaved like a poor, mean
spirited
wretch,
said
my Ladyhe has degraded the family
my marrying a low, vulgar creature, in direct
opposition
to the advice, nay
absolute
commands, of
my Lord and
myself
.
Upon my honor, Mr. Howard,
said
my Lord,
I had contracted
such
an
esteem
for the lad, that I
had
positively
determined to adopt him; but on
his
absolutely
persisting
in his
design
of marrying
the low creature my Lady mentions, I forbid him
my
house
:I had no intention to adopt a
beggar's
brat.
The
conversation
was now interrupted by a
servant
,
who informed my Lady there was company
in the drawing room
she
begged leave of her
brother
to go and receive them; and my Lord, having
rung for his valet, retired to
adjust
his
dress
.
The ECLAIRCISSEMENT.
Captain
Howard had been abruptly informed
that his
son
had forfeited his uncle's favour; had
been informed of it in a manner
inconsiderate
and
unfeeling, and then left to
himself
to reflect at
leisure
on his misfortune.
He
sat
with one hand
resting
on the
breakfast
table, and the other in his
bosom
, his brow
contracted
,
and his eyes fixed on the floorthere was
such
a dignity in his
person
, and yet
such
an
apparent
concern upon his countenance, that my
affections
were drawn towards him by an
irresistible
impulse
I
longed to call him brother and friend
my heart was wrung with
sensibility
.
And what avails it,
said
I, that this man has
accumulated
a large fortune?of what benefit is
wealth to him?he had looked upon his
son
as his
greatest
treasure
for
these
many years has his
delighted
imagination drawn a
most
perfect picture of
felicity in the idea of beholding this beloved
son
,
and
seeing
him enjoying the favour of his uncle,
and perhaps wedded to
some
amiable woman, who,
to the gifts of birth and fortune, added the gifts of
nature,
whose
beauty created love, and her virtue
esteem
.
Behold him now in one moment bereaved of
this darling hope, his heart aching with paternal
love and fearoh! would children but reflect how
greatly the
happiness
of a parent depends on their
well doing; could they have the
least
idea of the
mighty pangs which tear the parental
bosom
when
they
stray
from their duty, they would
surely
avoid
every action which might tend to
disturb
the peace
or wound the minds of their parents; for
sure
I am,
that not the
sharpest
torture
enthusiastic
zeal could
invent, can equal the torments that rend the heart
of a fondly-doating
disappointed
parent.
My meditations were interrupted by a decent,
elderly woman, who opened the door, and,
advancing
to Captain Howard, welcomed him cordially
to England.
My good Mrs.
Watson
,
said
he, taking her by
her hand, can you tell me where Charles is, and to
whom he has united
himself
so
contrary to the
desire
of his uncle and aunt?
It was for that
purpose
,
said
Mrs.
Watson
, that
I took the liberty of coming into the room to
speak
to youbut this room, Sir, is not a proper place
to
converse
in; I
must
beg you to come into my
apartment, and I will then inform you of
some
circumstances
which will fill you with
astonishment
.
I felt a
curiosity
which I could not
withstand
,
and, anxious for the fate of Charles, I followed
Captain Howard and Mrs.
Watson
into another
apartment. Mrs.
Watson
I found was Lady
M's
housekeeper
, and had formerly lived in that
capacity with her
Ladyship
's motherWhen
Captain Howard was
seated
,
she
related the
following
circumstances
:
You know, Sir,
said
she
,
just
before you left
England
,
my Lady, at my Lord's
request
, had taken
Miss
Isabella
Beauchamp to be her companion
you had not been gone many years before Mr.
Beauchamp died
insolvent
, and the poor young
Lady
had no dependance but on my Lord, who was a
distant
relation of her father's. From the time of
Mr. Beauchamp's death, Lady M altered in her
behaviour to
Miss
Bella; treated her often with
disrespect
; and in general, with cold contempt
My Lord, on the contrary, behaved with the
greatest
politeness
, affiduity, and attention; made her
elegant
presents
,
insisted
on her joining all parties,
public or private, in which Lady M was
included
young
Mr. Howard
shewed
the attention
of a brother; and, I
must
own, this conduct
raised
both the gentlemen highly in my opinion. It was
with great concern that I noticed a
settled
melancholy
on
Miss
Bella's countenance, and often would
P 2
she
retire from a crowded
assembly
to her own
apartment and give a
loose
to her tears
she
had
always
conducted
herself
in
such
a manner as to gain
the love of all the
domestics
, and
she
had favoured
me with many
singular
marks of
friendship
I
therefore took the liberty one day to enquire into
the
cause
of her melancholy; when
bursting
into a
flood of grief,
she
cried, oh! Mrs.
Watson
, what
will become of me? Lord M
pursues
me with
a criminal
passion
I cannot
stay
in this family to
be
subject
to his
insults
; and if I leave it, how
shall
I guard
myself
from the
snares
and
insults
of the
unfeeling part of mankind, who know not how to
pity poverty? or how
shall
I provide for the
necessaries
of life? I endeavoured all in my power to
console
her, and told her I would certainly look out for
some
reputable family where
she
might be boarded
on moderate terms, and that I would
advise
her to
sell
a few of her jewels to provide for the
present
,
and
trust
in Providence that her future life may be
more fortunate
she
gave me a pair of diamond
earings, which were her mother's, to
dispose
of;
but as I was returning to my own apartment I met
Mr. Howard, and knowing he was always
plentifully
supplied
with money by his aunt, I
determined
to make him acquainted with
Miss
Bella's
situation
,
and engage him to
assist
herbut judge my
surprise
, when I had informed him of my Lord's
designs
, to hear him fly into a violent rage, and
swear
she
should
not
stay
another hour in the
house
,
called her his wife, his adored Bella, and was
hastening
to her apartment, when he was
stopped
by his aunt, who had overheard our
conversation
,
and peremptorily demanded whether he had been
so
mean
spirited
as to marry
Miss
Beauchamp?
he
answered
with warmth, he was not married to
her; but
since
there was no other way to
shield
her
from the contempt of pride and the
insults
of
libertinism
,
he would marry her the next morning.
Lady M was greatly irritated, and
sent
a
message
to
Miss
Beauchamp, commanding her to quit
her
house
instantly
Charles followed the poor
distressed
girl; and before my Lord returned, who
was then in the country, prevailed on her to give
him a lawful right to protect her.
However ill
Miss
Beauchamp had been treated,
Mr. Howard thought it was his duty to
visit
his
uncle
,
and
sue
for his pardon, for the precipitate
step
he had taken.
They made their appearance the morning after
my Lord came to townit is
unnecessary
, and
would only be
shocking
your feelings, to give you
an account of the reception they met with;
suffice
it to
say
, they were
spurned
by the haughty pair,
and turned with indignity out of the
house
.
Lord M
swearing
by all that was holy he would
not give them a
single
farthing to keep them from
starving
they left the
house
, and I never heard
where they were till
last
summer
, when I
accidentally
found them in a mean cottage, which they
rented of Lord M's
steward
they went by an
assumed
name, and Mrs. Howard having bred very
fast
, and being very weakly, they were reduced to
the
most
abject
state
of penury.
Then
these
are my poor cottagers,
said
I.
Mr. Howard, when he had heard the
conclusion
of her relation,
arose
from his
seat
and looking at
once joy and indignation,
swore
he would never
rest
till he had found his dear injured Charles.
I will find him,
said
he; and his lovely
Isabella
shall
be rewarded for all her love and patient
sufferings
he
gave the
housekeeper
something
by way
of gratuity, and immediately departedwhen I,
having no farther
business
there, followed his
example
.
NATURAL REFLECTION.
It
has often
surprised
me to find that people who
have, with unbounded
generosity
, educated,
cloathed
,
and
fostered
an infant in childhood, indulging
it to an extravagant degree, never
suffering
it to be
contradicted, but bringing it up in
ease
aud luxury,
shall
, when that infant arrives at years of maturity,
when it has attained
sense
and
reason
sufficient
to
enable it to judge what will
most
conduce to its
own
happiness
, for the
most
trifling
misdemeanor
,
nay, for only daring to think contrary to its
benefactors
,
or
presuming
to
choose
a companion for
itself
,
spurn
from them, with indignity, the object
they once
cherished
, and drive it out
defenceless
to
brave
those
storms
of
adversity
which the education
they have
bestowed
on it renders it totally unable to
combat withit has often puzzled me to determine
whether
such
people have ever been actuated by true
generosity
. Pure philanthropy will lead us rather
to
study
the
happiness
of a human being, when it
is capable of receiving real
satisfaction
from our
kindness
. So far from evincing our affection to
children by unlimited indulgencies, we are acting
with cruelty toward them,
since
we are laying up
a fund of
discontent
and
uneasiness
for hereafter.
How hard is it for
those
darlings of families,
whose
every
desire
has been complied with, who never
wished
for a toy or bauble but it was procured,
though at the
most
exorbitant price, who was
always
fed with the
greatest
dainties, to find, when
arrived at maturity, that they are journeying thro'
a world where they will unavoidably meet with
disappointments
, vexation, and troublefor my
part, I would never indulge my children in a
wish
which I thought might tend hereafter to render
them unhappy; I would teach them to confine
their
desires
within the bounds of moderation, not
by
morosely
opposing
all their little fancies, but by
insensibly
drawing off their attention to any other
objects.
As they advanced in years, I would, by
example
,
teach them that forbearance and
self
-denial,
which precept alone will ever fail to effect. If
they have affluence, let them enjoy every
reasonable
wish
of their hearts; and no one need inquire what
is to be done with the overplus.
Oh! ye

The INGRATE.
Do
you
see
that beautiful woman in that
splendid
equipage,
surrounded
by a train of
servants
?
'tis the
thoughtless
, ungrateful Amelia.
Behold that poor old woman who toils through
the dirt unattended by any but her two lovely
daughters,
sweet
as opening flowers, and innocent
as new-born infants;
see
on her venerable
countenance
what grief and
despondency
is imprinted!
see
the big tears roll down her
surrowed
cheeks!
see
she
enters an
obscure
apartment, and a
scanty
meal is divided between her children and
herself
.
She looks at them by turns with
such
maternal
tenderness
,
such
anguish
of heart, that
she
seems
to
say
, what will become of you, my
sweet
children
;
how will you
pass
through life when I am
gone.
That poor old woman was Amelia's
benefactress
but
it is fit I
should
tell my tale
methodically
.
Amelia was the daughter of a gentleman of
small
fortune, who,
besides
her, had nine other children:
Mrs. Ellwin was a
distant
relation of the family;
she
was the wife of an opulent merchant, and
their habitation was the habitation of
philanthropy
.
Amelia had received a tolerable education
she
was pretty in her
person
, chearful in her
disposition
,
and had a good
share
of
understanding
; with
these
accomplishments
, Mrs. Ellwin thought it
would be a pity for Amelia to be buried in
obscurity
;
she
gave her an invitation to her
house
,
cloathed her genteelly, and introduced her into
such
company as
she
thought would be
most
conducive
to her future advancement in life. It was not long
before Amelia's charms made a
conquest
of a
gentleman
of large fortunehe loved her; and her
virtues were
so
kindly brought forward by Mrs.
Ellwin, and her little faults buried in oblivion, that
he overlooked her want of fortune, made her his
wife, and
settled
upon her 5001. per annum
jointure
.
Amelia had not long enjoyed this
advancement
,
before Mr. Ellwin, having placed too great
a dependance on the honor of a friend,
lost
a large
sum
of money; of
consequence
his payments were
not punctual, and he became a bankrupt.
He
struggled
for
some
time
against
his
adverse
fate, but at length died of a broken heart, and left
his wife and lovely daughters no inheritance but
poverty.
About this time Amelia became a widow:but
Amelia was now a fine lady
she
had no time to
spend
with poor relations, no money to
spare
to
relieve
the
distresses
of Mrs. Ellwin; though her
wedding cloaths were
purchased
by that generous
friend, and
cost
near five hundred pounds, and that
sum
had never been repaid.
Amelia is now
just
married again, and flying
about
in all the gaiety of heart which wealth and
splendor
can
inspire
in a giddy mortal; while poor
Mrs. Ellwin is
sinking
under a load of
anguish
,
unpitied and unthought of. Her once blooming,
amiable daughters drooping like
frost
-nipped
blossoms
,
and neither
Friendship
, Humanity, nor
Gratitude
will reach forth a hand to cheer, revive, or
save
them.
But I am wandering from my intended route.
The SUICIDES.
As
I approached Mr. Vellum's
house
an
hearse
and
six
mourning coaches drove from the door.
Perhaps,
said
I, the guardian is gone to give an
account of his
guardianship
and a very black
account
I fear it will behowever I will go in;
perhaps I may learn
something
concerning the
death of Horace, or gain
some
intelligence which
may be
serviceable
to the
hapless
Julietta.
I put on my ring, and a
servant
opening the door
soon
afterwards, I entered unperceived.
I went into
several
rooms before I found any
body
likely to give me any
satisfaction
by their
conversation
.
At length I entered a chamber, where,
on an embroidered
sopha
, lay Mr. Vellum,
surrounded
by magnificencebut, good Heavens!
how changed from the man he once washis face
was
ghastly
pale, his eyes
sunk
, yet their motion
was
so
quick and fiery that they gave him the
appearance
of a fiend rather than an human being.
Opposite
to him, in a
pensive
posture
,
sat
a young
woman in a deep mourning habit; her face was
Q
partly concealed with her handkerchief, but the
part that appeared bore
such
evident marks of
sorrow
,
that a
savage
must
have felt his heart moved
with pity at the
sight
.
He is gone, gone for ever, cried Vellum,
starting
from the
sopha
, and catching hold of the young
lady's handhe is gone,
Hester
, and you know not
half the
anguish
of my
soul
.
My dear father,
said
she
, why will you give way
to unavailing
sorrow
? the kind Power who lent
him to you has but re-called his ownit is the lot
of mortalitythen, why my father, why will you
offend your Creator by repining at his divine will?
O,
Hester
, you do not know the dreadful
circumstances
of your brother's deathalas! my
child, he
rushed
unbidden into the prefence of his
Maker with multitudes of unrepented crimes upon
his head.
Did he
destroy
himself
? cried
Hestor
, the look
of woe changing into that of
inexpressible
horror.
Oh! what could tempt him to the dreadful deed?
Hester
, my beloved daughter, I was his
murderer
,
I was the
cause
of the horrid act.
Forbid it, gracious God,
she
cried,
clasping
her
hands and
sinking
upon her kneesOh! my
father
,
recall
those
shocking
words; you was not,
could not be,
so
inhuman.
Hester
,
said
he, with a look of horrid
firmness
,
I will unfold to you a tale which it is proper you
should
know; I may not long continue with you.
I have been guilty of deeds which will make
your tender heart
shudder
to acknowledge me as a
parentOh!
cursed
avarice, it was that which
led me to
stain
my
soul
with murder, and to ruin
my child, my darling
son
.For him and for thee
I would have gained an empire, though I had waded
to it through oceans of human blood: but to lead
him by vile
persuasions
to agree to, and execute the
accursed
plot, and plunge
himself
, for
sordid
ore, to
the
lowest
abyss
of hell.Oh! it is more than I
can bear to think ofmy
soul
is at this moment
suffering
all the tortures of the damned
scorpions
,
flames, and furies hang about meHorace, dear
murdered youth, well may you
smile
to
see
my
tortures
.
Was Horace murdered! Oh! inhuman wretch,
cried
Hester
then where is my
sweet
Julietta?
have you murdered her too?
I hope
she
still
lives,
said
Vellum; and may
your gentle
friendship
recall her wandering
reason
,
for my cruelty has bereaved her of her
senses
; and
if
she
is alive,
she
is a poor,
distressed
lunatic.
Gracious Heaven! cried
Hester
,
bursting
into a
flood of tears, and leaning her head upon the elbow
of the
sopha
.
The lovely girl, continued her father, is in a
miserable
cottage, on one of her own
estates
, in
Wiltshire
,
where I have employed an old woman to
watch her, and, by
harsh
treatment, prevent her
returning
to
reason
.
As to Horace he is no more.When I
sent
him
abroad, as I
said
, for education, your brother went
with himwe laid the
shocking
plot before the
vessel
sailed
; and one night as they were walking
the deck together, your brother
pushed
Horace
into
the
sea
the
vessel
was
sailing
before the wind,
and he was
lost
in a moment.
You, my dear
Hester
, I knew would be an
obstacle
to
these
hellish
schemes
, and for that
reason
I
sent
you to France.About three weeks
since
your
brother had a
thousand
pounds of me; and in a few
days after, applied for more; it was then I
discovered
he had a
propensity
for gamingI
remonstrated
with him on the folly of
such
a
pursuit
, and
refused
him a
supply
high words
ensued
he
accused
me of being a murderer; of drawing him
in to participate the crime, and then
refusing
him
a participation of the wealth I had by that means
gained.It is
impossible
for you to conceive the
terrors that
seized
my mind during this
conversation
;
I actually formed the
resolution
of giving this
darling of my
soul
into the hands of
justice
, and
thereby
saving
my own wretched lifebut before
I could execute my intention, I was alarmed by
the
discharge
of a
pistol
I ran to your brother's
room, and
saw
him weltering in his blood, a
pistol
clenched in his hand.
Go, leave me,
said
he, as I approached him;
add not, by thy hateful
presence
, to the horror of
this momentI thought, by dying, to
shut
out life
and
misery
together, to fly from the terrors of a
reproaching
conscience
; but, alas! my
miseries
are but
just
beginning.
Oh! thou
detested
, wretched old man, continued
he, drawing me forcibly towards him, thou art
ignorant
what a
task
thou
hast
yet to perform: Go,
lose
not a moment, but
use
every method to
restore
that injured angel Julietta to her
senses
give her
back her fortuneand do thou retire to
some
desert
fast
, pray, and lay upon the cold ground
years and years
spent
in
supplication
will hardly
gain that pardon you
so
much need.There is!
there is! an hereafterI feel it now
rush
on my
guilty
soul
.You do not know how hard it is to
die, to plunge at once into eternity.Oh! murder,
murder cannot be forgiven.
At that
instant
he expired with a groan,
so
hollow
,
that it
still
vibrates in my ears.
I hear thee, Oh! thou guilty
shade
I will obey
thee.
Hester
, continued Vellum, I have
sent
for you
home, that you may
administer
comfort to Julietta
here, take this paper, and go prepare for your
journey; when you are
separated
from me, open
it; you will there find full
instructions
how to act
leave me, my child; I am now more
composed
,
I may perhaps take
some
rest
.
Hester
gladly retired.
I
saw
from the agitation of her features, though
she
could not but pity the
distresses
of her father's
mind, it was
impossible
for her any longer to love
him.
That
task
is over,
said
Vellum, as
she
shut
the
doornow, what remains?to pray for pardon.
Pardon for what?Murder. Ah! that is not all;
my
soul
is loaded with crimes.Fraud, perjury,
oppression
, are in the horrid catalogue!the
widows
,
the
fatherless
children whom I have
oppressed
,
will
rise
up in judgment
against
me.Mercy
Oh! mercy
just
God!but wretch that I am,
did I ever
shew
mercywill that
just
Creator then
shew
mercy to me?Nofor I
must
appear at a
tribunal where every one will be rewarded
according
to his works.
Oh that I was annihilated!that I had never
livedfor the
distraction
of my mind is too mighty
to be borneI will not bear itI will end
my torturesmy life is in my own power; and it
is but to plunge at once into evils which cannot be
more dreadful than this
constant
terror.This is
the
instrument
,
said
he, taking a
pistol
from his
pocket.
Q 2
I
stepped
forward, in order to prevent his fatal
intention.
It
shall
be done quick,
said
heI will not
languish
I caught hold of his arm; but it was too late;
he had pointed the
pistol
to his templeit went off,
and he plunged in one moment into a dreadful
eternity
.
Oh!
save
him!
save
him! cried
Hester
,
bursting
into the room; he is not fit to die.
When
she
saw
the
shocking
catastrophe
,
she
uttered
a
scream
of terror, and
sunk
down upon the
floorthe
servants
entered, and all was in an
instant
a
scene
of
confusion
.
I thought I could gain no farther intelligence
and my
spirits
being greatly
depressed
by the
occurrences
of the day, I departed, determining in a few
days to pay the gentle, unfortunate
Hester
another
visit
.
The WIFE.
I wish
to go to Mrs. Melbourne's
assembly
,
next week, if agreeable to you, my dear,
said
a
woman
,
who was walking through the park with a
man
whose
appearance
spoke
him the gentleman.
She was a pretty-looking
person
; her
countenance
was open and engaging, and there was a mild
air of tender melancholy
diffused
over it.
She led by the hand a beautiful girl, about four
or five years old; and a
smiling
boy,
seemingly
a
year or two older, was
skipping
, with
steps
as light
as his own innocent heart, before them that man,
said
I,
must
surely
be happy.
I examined his countenance with a
scrutinizing
eye, and methought I read in it indifference and
inattention
;
nay, he even
seemed
uneasy
in the
company
of his wife and lovely children.
I
should
like to go to Mrs. Melbourne's
assembly
,
said
she
, putting her hand under his arm,
and giving him a look of
tenderness
it was a look
I know not well how to
describe
; it was a
mixture
of affection and gentle
solicitude
; it was that
kind of look my Emma ever
assumes
when
she
has
any little favour to
ask
, and it always carries with
it
such
persuasive
eloquence, that for my
soul
I
could not
refuse
, though
she
were to
request
the
half of my fortune.
You want new cloaths too, I
suppose
,
said
he,
rather
surlily
.
I thought you might make it convenient to let
me have my half-years
stipend
,
said
she
, mildly;
and you know, my dear, I never exceed it.
Very well, Madam, I hear enough of your
conomy
,
said
he, withdrawing his arm in anger; but
I tell you I have no money for
myself
, and
therefore
cannot let you have any.I do not
see
why
you
should
go to Mrs. Melbourne's; you may find
employment and
amusement
too in
nursing
your
brats; home is the
fittest
place for women.
I will not go, Mr. Selby, if you
desire
I
should
not.
There, now, make a merit of
staying
at home to
oblige me, when you cannot go
because
I will not
give you money to
lavish
in finery. The
education
of your children
costs
me
so
much that I intend
for the future to reduce your allowance to half what
it
used
to be.
Very well, my dear, you are the
best
judge of
what you can afford; I
shall
always have your
interest
too much at heart to repine at being deprived
of a few
superfluities
which I can
easily
do
without
.
By this time they were arrived at Spring
Gardens
,
where an
handsome
chariot was waiting.
I am engaged out this evening,
said
he, handing
her into the carriage.
Shall I
see
you at
supper
?
said
she
, again
assuming
the look of
solicitude
; but it was far more
anxious
than the former.
Noperhaps I
shall
not return all night,
said
he; and immediately left her without even the
common form of civility.
Drive on,
said
she
, to the coachman; and as the
carriage moved, I
saw
her apply her handkerchief
to her eyes.
Poor woman!
said
I; at that
instant
feeling the
drop of pity
start
into my own.Poor woman!
thou art
surrounded
with wealth, have a number of
servants
, and, no doubt, for
these
advantages, are
the object of envy in the eyes of many; but, alas!
the poor cottager,
whose
mansion
appears the
habitation
of poverty, who has
just
set
by her wheel,
and is feeding a number of cherry-cheeked,
curlypated
,
ragged children,
whose
husband
, returning
from the labours of the field,
accosts
her with words
of
kindness
,
kisses
all his little prattlers round, and
takes the
youngest
on his knee to
share
his
homely
supper
, that humble cottager is happier far than
you.
These
reflections had
passed
with
such
rapidity
through my brain, that Mr. Selby was
still
in
sight
.
I will follow thee,
said
I, and
see
what has
had power to charm thee from
so
sweet
,
so
gentle a
companion.
Having got my ring on, I quickened my pace,
and
soon
overtook him.
He proceeded to May Fair; when knocking at
the door of a large
house
, a
servant
in a
showey
livery
opened it; when, taking the advantage of my
invisibility
, I entered, and followed him through
a magnificent
suite
of rooms into a drawing room.
The MISTRESS.
She
was an elegant-formed woman, rather
above
the middle
size
; her features were regular,
and her complexion would have been dazzling, had
it not been for an immoderate quantity of rouge
which
she
had laid on her face, which, in reality,
required no art to make it lovely; her eyes were
dark, lively, and piercing; and her hair, which was
bright as golden thread, hung in wanton ringlets
round her face and neck; her
dress
was
studiedly
negligent, being only a white
muslin
robe with
small
silver
sprigs
; it was
fastened
round her
slender
waist
with a velvet zone, ornamented with
pearl;
she
was
seated
by a table on which
sat
a
little
French dog, which
she
was
caressing
as we
entered
.
My charming
Lassonia
,
said
he, running to her
with
eagerness
, how tedious have the hours
passed
that kept me from you!
No doubt they have,
said
she
, coldly evading his
offered embrace; when you have made it two hours
later than you
promised
.
My
dearest
love, I could not avoid it,
said
he,
business
of importance
Oh you are a very prudent man,
said
she
;
scornfully
;
by all means
business
should
be attended to
before
pleasure
; but it is very well, Mr. Selby. I
have waited at home to hear your paltry
excuse
for
breaking your word; but I have made an
engagement
which I cannot
possibly
break; my chair is
waiting:
She
arose
to leave the room.
My Angel, my dear
Lassonia
,
said
he, catching
her hands, you
surely
do not mean to leave me;
hear me but one word; I
should
have been here
much
sooner
had I not overtaken my wife and
children in the park, and
she
begun teazing me for
money.
And you gave it her?
said
she
, with
precipitation
.
No, my charmer, I have not given it to her, I
have
reserved
it for you; there is not a
wish
my
Lassonia
can form but
shall
be immediately
complied
withEmily had
set
her heart upon going to
Mrs. Melbourne's
assembly
; but I knew my
adored
girl intended to be there, and did not
wish
to
meet her;
so
I have
desired
her not to go.
And have you brought me your wife's diamonds?
said
she
.
No but you
shall
have
some
, more valuable
than
those
we will go out now, and you
shall
chuse
them at any price you
please
.
What, I
suppose
,
said
she
, with a look of
contempt
,
your wife
refused
to part with them; and
you, a poor, tame-
spirited
husband
, dared not
contradict
her; but I will have her jewels or none,
so
take your choice, Sir, either bring me the
meek,
dutiful
Emily's diamonds, or never
see
me more.
What a pity it is,
said
I, as I
stood
contemplating
this
scene
, what a pity
so
lovely a form
should
conceal
so
vile a heart; that woman appears a
masterpiece
of nature, and yet draw
aside
that
beauteous
veil, and there is
such
soul
deformity within,
that we
shrink
with horror and
disgust
from the
very object which at
first
view filled us with
admiration
.
I am unwilling to
refuse
you any thing, my
sweet
girl,
said
he; but indeed I do not know how
to get the jewels; I have no
plausible
pretext to
ask
for them.
And is this your
boasted
love?
said
she
, this the
fidelity, the
servent
passion
you have
so
repeatedly
sworn
? am I to be denied
so
trifling a
gratification
because
you cannot bear a few tears from that
proud minx your wife? have I not
sacrificed
every
thing for you?
relinquished
reputation, honor,
friends; and is this the return? this the gratitude
I am to meet with? you would
sooner
break my
heart than comply with the
smallest
of my
wishes
.
During
these
reproaches
she
had vented her
passion
by tears.
Do not thus
distress
yourself
, my
dearest
creature
,
said
Selby; you cut me to the
soul
by your
reproaches; come, dry up your tears, and tell me
in what can I oblige you?
Go and bring me Emily's diamonds this evening,
said
she
.
I came to
spend
the night with you, my love,
then do not
send
me from you; let us go out and
purchase
some
other trinkets.
I will have nothing but the diamonds!
exclaimed
she
, in an agony of
passion
; which reminded
me of Othello in his jealous fury raving for the
fatal
handkerchief.
At length the infatuated Selby, finding it was in
vain to attempt to
sooth
her, and being, as he
said
,
unable to live without her, actually
promised
to go
home and fetch the jewels for which
she
expressed
such
a
desire
.
I was determined to go with him, and
hastily
stepping
down
stairs
before him,
stepped
unperceived
into a hackney coach which he had
sent
for,
and was waiting for him at the doora
short
time
brought us to Gower
street
.
The RECEPTION.
This
is kind indeed, my love,
said
Mrs.
Selby
,
meeting him with a
smile
as he entered the
parlour; I was afraid you would not have
returned
so
soon
.
Pshaw
,
said
he, throwing
himself
into a chair;
I do not
suppose
you will be
so
pleased
when I tell
you the
business
which brought me home.
If it is any thing which will make you
uneasy
,
my dear,
said
she
, I
shall
certainly regret it; but
if it only concerns
myself
I
shall
regret nothing
which gives me the extatic
pleasure
of your
company
.
You are a good girl, Emily,
said
he, taking her
handand methought at that
instant
he repented
the
task
he had undertakenbut it was a
momentary
reflection.
I have
occasion
for a large
sum
of money,
said
he, to make up a payment, and I have no
possible
means of
raising
it.
Good God! cried
she
, turning pale with
apprehension
,
are your
circumstances
really
so
bad
then?
Make no inquiries,
said
he, but
consider
if you
can form any plan to relieve me.
How much do you want my love?
About two
thousand
pounds.
I dare
say
my father will lend you
such
a trifle,
rather than you
should
be
distressed
.
So, Madam,
said
he, you would
advise
me
to apply to your father, and make my misfortunes
the talk of the town.You
say
you love me,
Emily.
Heaven knows I do
most
servently
.
Then to prove it, bring me your jewels, they
will procure me the money I want.
You cannot
raise
so
large a
sum
without my
mother's
also
; and I
should
not
wish
to part with
them.
A very pretty declaration indeed, Madam; you
value your mother's memory more than your
husband's
peace of mind.
Oh! do not
say
so
harsh
a word,
said
she
; I
will bring the jewelshad I the
universe
at my
command it would be of no value to me when put
in competition with your
happiness
.
She left the room, and
soon
returned with the
jewels.
Here they are,
said
she
; would to Heaven
every
desire
which you form may be as
easily
obtained
.
He looked them over.
These
are not all,
said
he
A
blush
of
confusion
passed
over the pale face of
the trembling Emily.
I have indeed
reserved
some
,
said
she
; but do
not be angry, I cannot part with the
first
tokens
R
of your love; I cannot part with your
picture
.
I
must
have all,
said
he, impatiently.
The afflicted wife drew from her throbbing
bosom
a miniature picture
set
with diamonds, and a
small
, but valuable locket, emblamatical of love and
peace; he took them from her
Leave me the picture,
said
she
take the
diamonds
;
but, for pity's
sake
, take not that dear,
first
pledge of your love.The picture will not enhance
the value to any but me.
I cannot
stay
to take it out,
said
he, putting the
jewels into his pocket, and giving the poor,
weeping
Emily a
slight
kiss
; he
snatched
up his hat and
instantly
returned to the vile
Lassonia
.
I had been too much
disgusted
with that
woman's
behaviour to entertain a thought of returning
with him, therefore, taking off my ring, when I
left the
house
, I walked toward home.
The INFORMATION.
Being
at the play with a friend
some
months
after, I
observed
Lassonia
in a box
opposite
to that
in which I
sat
, adorned with the very jewels which
Selby had obtained from his affectionate wife.
Who that
sees
that woman,
said
I to my friend,
but would think her the
loveliest
work of creation.
I have been admiring her for
some
time,
said
he;
can you give me any information concerning her?
I have
seen
her once before, and am quite
captivated
with her beauty; if her mind is equal to her
person
, I could freely devote my life to
such
a
woman
.
There is no more
comparison
between her mind
and her form,
said
an old gentleman, in a black coat
and a
snug
round wig, who
sat
just
behind us
there is no more
comparison
between them,
said
he,
than there is between an angel of Light and a d
mon of Hell.
Do you know her, Sir,
said
my friend, turning
hastily
round.
I do, young man,
said
he; and to guard you
from the effects of her pernicious charms, if you
will
sup
with me after the play, I will tell you a tale
that
shall
make you hate her.
When the play was over we adjourned to a
tavern
,
and after
supper
our new friend gave us the
history
of
Lassonia
.
Miss
Freeman and
Miss
Eldridge,
said
, he, were
the daughters of two opulent
tradesmen
; their
fathers
were united in the
closest
bonds of amity.
Emily Freeman and
Lassonia
Eldridge were
playmates
in infancy, educated at the
same
school
, and
contracted for each other the affection of
sister
.
Emily had
just
entered her
sixteenth
year, when
she
was called from
school
to attend an excellent
mother
,
who was
hastily
advancing to that bourne
from whence no traveller returns.
Lassonia
would
not be
separated
from her friend on this trying
occasion
,
and Mrs. Freeman
soon
after paying the
debt of nature,
she
was retained by Mr. Freeman
as a companion,
whose
vivacity would prevent
Emily from too frequently
musing
on her recent
loss
.
Mr. Selby became acquainted with the lovely
friends before Emily had attained her eighteenth
yearher
sense
and penetration charmed him; and
her
person
, having then all the attractions of
blooming
youth, he declared
himself
her loverhe
frequently
laughed and romped with
Lassonia
, but
never
entertained a thought of love, as her conduct
in general was
so
slighty
, and her
conversation
so
trifling, that though it was
impossible
to avoid
admiring
her beauty,
she
had not one
requisite
calculation
to create
esteem
.
About this time Mr. Eldridge was taken ill
the
physicians
feared a
consumption
, and
advised
a
journey to Montpelier
Lassonia
accompanied her
father, and during their
absence
Emily gave her
hand to Mr. Selby. Mr. Eldridge recovered his
health, and they
revisited
England; when, no
mention
being made of
Lassonia
's returning to Mrs.
Selby,
she
continued with her father to
superintend
his family. Two years
passed
on in delightful
harmony between Mr. and Mrs. Selby, in which
time
she
presented
him with a boy and a girl.
During that period the father of
Lassonia
died
insolvent
,
and
she
was reduced to the
necessity
of
going
to
service
, as there was not the
least
provision
for her future
subsistence
.
It was then the generous,
disinterested
Emily
offered
her an
asylum
in her
house
, appointed her an
apartment, a
servant
to attend her, and
supplied
her
with cloaths and money from her own private
purse
.
Lassonia
had not long been an inmate in the
house
of her friend, before, envious of her felicity,
she
determined to imbitter it by alienating the
affection
of Selby from his truly amiable wifeSelby
was young, and fond of variety; his
passion
for
Emily was greatly abated by
possession
, and though
he
almost
venerated her for her virtues, the charms
of her
faithless
friend enflamed his heart, and he
eagerly caught at the frequent opportunities which
she
intentionally gave him to plead his
passion
.
Lassonia
is a proud woman; her
situation
was
irksome
, though every favour from Emily was
conferred
in
so
delicate a manner that an indifferent
spectator
would have imagined her the
person
obliged.
She was
likewise
an artful woman;
she
soon
gained
such
an
ascendancy
over Selby, that while
Emily
scarcely
dared to hint her
wishes
,
Lassonia
demanded with authority, and gained every
desire
.
Yet of
so
gentle,
unsuspicious
, a temper was Mrs.
Selby, and
so
great a confidence did
she
place in the
honor of her friend and her
husband
, that though
Lassonia
remained in the family near a
twelve-month
after her connection with Selby,
she
never
once thought
such
a thing could happen. She
frequently
lamented to her treacherous friend the
alteration
in her
husband
's behaviour, but
she
never
suspected
her as the
cause
of her
uneasiness
.
But
Lassonia
now found it
necessary
to remove
from Mrs. Selby's, to prevent her
shame
from
becoming
public;
she
told Emily that
she
was
distressed
at being
so
great an incumbrance to her, and
that having an opportunity of going abroad with a
lady, who wanted a companion,
she
would
embrace
it, and endeavour to contribute to her own
support
. By this conduct
she
laid a plan to
prevent
returning to the family, which
she
predetermined
not to do before
she
left it.
Mrs. Selby loaded her with obligations at
parting
.
She retired to a
small
house
about twenty
miles from town which Selby had provided for her
reception, and where
she
remained three years,
Selby
spending
great part of his time with her.
R 2
About
six
months
since
she
came to town,
assumed
the name of Green, took an elegant
house
,
and
set
up a carriage. Mrs. Selby hearing of her
arrival, and
supposing
she
was married,
requested
me, who at that time was ignorant of the
circumstances
I have now related, to go with her and
pay
Lassonia
a morning
visit
.
We were
shewn
into the drawing room by a
servant
, who informed us his
misterss
would be
down in a few minutes, but that
she
was then
dressing
.
How agreeably
surprised
my dear
Lassonia
will
be,
said
Emily, to find I am the lady who wanted
to
speak
with herfor
she
had
sent
up no
name.
We were chatting on indifferent
subjects
, when
a child ran into the room, crying, I will have
papa's
picture; I won't break it indeed; a maid
following
him in; he ran to Emily,
whose
arms were
extended to receive him, and throwing the picture
into her lap, judge her feelings when
she
saw
the
portrait of Mr. Selby, which
she
had given him
but two days before with the
greatest
regret,
imagining
him in want of money. Her feelings
over-powered
her, and
she
fell
lifeless
on the floor. The
cries of the
servant
alarmed the family, and
Lassonia
,
thinking
some
misfortune had happened to
her child,
rushed
into the room followed by Selby
himself
.
It is
impossible
to
describe
the
scene
that
ensued
on the recovery of Emily
Lassonia
raved, Mrs.
Selby wept, and Selby appeared
motionless
as a
statue
.
As
soon
as Emily was able to walk, I took her
hand and led her to the carriage. Upon her
return
home, her fainting fits returned;
she
passed
a
night of inconceivable
distress
, for Selby never
came near her; and in the morning
she
was in a
violent fever. I then went in
pursuit
of the
perfidious
husband
; but as the
suffering
faint
desired
,
forbore to reproach him.
I found him, and he returned with me to
her.
She beheld him approach with a faint
smile
It
is kind, my Selby,
said
she
, to come and receive the
parting
sigh
of her who has
so
long been a barrier to
your
happiness
; indeed I did not know, or I never
would have
visited
my happy rivalI never thought
your love was divided, and the certainty of it came
so
sudden
upon my heart, that weak and
unprepared
as it was, it could not bear the
shock
take
care of my children,
said
she
, adieu my love; my
heart may break, but my tongue will never
reproach
you.
Her
disorder
hourly
increased
; a delirium
ensued
;
and before the next morning
she
breathed
her
last
, invoking
blessings
on the head of her
faithless
husband
and treacherous friend.
The DISSERTATION.
It
is
such
women as
Lassonia
who
cast
an
odium
on the whole
sex
; and
such
women are not
only objects of contempt but
detestation
. I am
not of opinion that women would never
degenerate
into vice, were they not at
first
seduced
by
man; certain I am, though my heart achs at the
idea, that there are many women who are
abandoned
to all manner of
wickedness
entirely through
the depravity of their inclinations.Oh! how my
soul
rises
with indignation to
see
the
fairest
works
of the Creator's hand
so
far forget their native
dignity as to glory in actions which
debase
them
beneath the
lowest
reptile that crawls upon the
earth! To
see
a woman loaded with ornaments
which are the wages of guilt, and exulting in the
badges of her
dishonor
; to
see
her admitted into
all public places, and rudely
pressing
before the
meek and virtuousI could
strip
her of her gaudy
trappings, and, to bring her to a
just
sense
of her
infamous conduct, feed her upon bread and water,
till convinced of the
necessity
of repentance,
she
should
gladly embrace the
most
servile
employment
,
and accept the
meanest
apparel, rather than
return to her former life of vice and
dissipation
.
How many families have been ruined by
licentious
women! How many virtuous wives have
sunk
, broken-hearted to the grave! how many
innocent
orphans have been
sent
portionless
into the
world, through their diabolical machinations! and,
alas! (I
shudder
as the thought occurs) how many
wretched women, forgetful of their marriage vows,
have
relinquished
a tender
husband
, a family of
children,
whose
innocent
caresses
should
have
linked
her heart
inseparably
to their father, and thrown
herself
into the arms of an abandoned libertine!
let not
such
a woman plead
seduction
a married
woman
must
, by her conduct give
some
encouragement
before the
most
profligate man would dare
offend her ear with a declaration of love; and weak,
very weak,
must
be her
repulses
, if he ventures to
persevere
in his impious
pursuit
.
From the
inmost
recesses
of my
soul
do I pity
the unhappy girl who, betrayed by the
impulse
of
affection, falls a prey to an
insidious
villain, and,
abandoned by her
seducer
, is
exposed
to the
scorn
and contempt of the worldOh! how my heart
has been wrung to
see
poor girls who are
scarcely
past
their childhood,
whose
misfortune it has been
to have wicked
advisers
,
so
early initiated into the
school
of vice. Their tender frames, which once
perhaps, by kind, paternal care, were
shielded
from
the winds of Heavennow
defenceless
, in the
most
inclement
season
exposed
to noxious damps and
pinching cold, and when they
most
stand
in need
of
consolation
, when bowed
almost
to the grave
with want,
disease
, and
shame
, to
see
them
rest
their wearied bones upon the cold damp
pavement
,
and lay their aching heads upon the
steps
of
an
house
where a woman dwells,
whose
heart is a
thousand
times more guilty than theirs, who
sins
without
remorse
, and riots in wealth and luxury.
I never
see
the poor nightly wanderers that
infest
our
streets
, but,
spite
of my endeavours to the
contrary, the tear of
anguish
will
steal
unbidden to
my eye.
Poor
souls
! I often
say
, poor unhappy creatures,
would to Heaven I had a fortune capacious as my
heart, that I might
snatch
you from perdition, and
teach you the road to
everlasting
felicity. I would
guard you from the
insults
of the world; I would
cherish
you,
listen
to all your tales of
sorrow
, and
join my tears with yours, till we had
washed
away
the
stains
of guilt, and taught you that to be
happy
,
is to be happy.
Oh! my fair countrywomen, turn not away from
the plaints of
misery
;
scorn
not the daughters of
affliction; for, if by clemency and humanity you
could draw one
miserable
object from the thorny
paths of vice, and
restore
her to peace with her own
soul
, you would do an act more acceptable in the
sight
of your Creator, than the man who
bestows
thousands
for the endowment of an
hospital
the
first
action
must
proceed from innate
goodness
of
the heart; the
last
may from
self
-lovea man may
do a public act of benevolence to perpetuate his
name, and dignify
himself
with the title of
generous
;
but that pure charity which leads us to
forgive
the
sailing
of our fellow creatures, chear the
desponding
heart, and wipe the grief-
swoln
eye of
an
obscure
individual,
must
be the
result
of
religion
;
it is a
sort
of benevolence which gratifies the
heart in performing good deeds, but
blushes
whenever
those
actions are repeatedIt feels the
most
exalted
pleasure
in relieving a
distressed
fellow
creature, but it is pained to receive
acknowledgements
.
The ARREST.
I WILL go and pay the
disconsolate
Hester
a
visit
,
said
I, one morning as I was rambling near
Chelsea
. I bent my
steps
toward her habitation;
but had not proceeded far before I
observed
a young
man,
whose
dress
had formerly been genteel, but
was now
shabby
in the extreme; his hair had once
been
dressed
, but it might have been
some
three
weeks or a month
since
; his coat was
de couleur de
puce
, but much the
worse
for wear, as the elbows
discovered
a very fine, but dirty,
shirt
; his once
satin
waistcoat
was threadbare and
greasy
, his
breeches
loose
and ragged at the knees; a pair of
dirty
silk
stockings
, ornamented with here and there
a hole, hung in a
slovenly
manner about his legs;
and the
sable
fril of his
shirt
, that peeped from his
breast
, was trimmed with the
finest
edgingThat
man has once been a coxcomb,
said
; for I
always
judge when I
see
the remains of finery put on
carelessly
or disfigured with dirt, that the wearer
has formerly been extravagant in his
dress
.
I approached the tattered beau in order to take a
view of his
person
, when I
discovered
the features
of my old acquaintance Mr. Woudbe.
And this is the end of ignorant pride,
ostentation
,
and folly,
said
Ino doubt you would now be
glad of a friend to
administer
to
those
wants which
henceforth you will learn to pity in othersbut I
fear your conduct has been
such
that you have no
friends to apply to.
The thought was
scarcely
passed
before two
disagreeable
looking fellows came up, and
shewing
the trembling Woudbe a bit of parchment, he was
forced to
surrender
himself
their
prisoner
.
Just
at that time a young man of
fashion
passing
, and recollecting Woudbe,
accosted
him with heigh!
Jack, what! come to this already! I thought you
would have held it out a little longerha! ha!
what a rueful figure!all out at the elbows eh!
A truce with your
sneers
, Sir,
said
Woudbe,
assuming
an air of importance, I
stand
in need of
twenty pounds immediatelyyou have frequently
made me offers of
service
; lend me that
sum
, and
I
shall
be obliged to you.
Ah! Jack,
said
the other, that air and manner
won't do now, it did very well while the
l'argent
lasted
, and you was a gentleman at large; but now
you are again plain Jack Woudbe, the
Cabinet-maker
;
you
must
learn to bow, cringe, and mind
your
business
I am
sorry
it goes
so
hard with you;
but depend upon it, this will always be the
case
with young men of trifling fortunes, who ape the
manners, and launch into extravagancies, which
are only becoming their
superiors
I would lend
you the money with all my heart, but I know you
have no way to repay it, and are too proud to go
to work; therefore you had better
submit
to your
fate with a good grace.
The poor
crest
fallen Woudbe walked away with
his
disagreeable
companions, and the
stranger
addressed
himself
to methat young man, Sir,
said
he, was the
son
of an
industrious
tradesman
, who
by
strict
attention to
business
,
scraped
together
about
three or four
thousand
pounds; at his death
this money was left for his only
son
, who was then
getting a little education at a cheap
school
in the
country.
When fifteen years old, he was apprenticed to a
capital Cabinet-maker; a very
handsome
premium
was given with him; but he was too much of the
gentleman to attend to
business
, and when he came
of age he
assumed
the
dress
and manners of a man
of
fashion
;
expensive
amusements
, treats, balls,
and the retinue of
dissipation
and folly were eagerly
attended tobut this would not
last
long; it is now
over; and even if he makes friends to get from his
present
cinfinement, I know of no method he can
pursue
for future
subsistence
.
Such young men as
these
,
said
I, by their folly
are often involved in difficulties, which, in hopes
of extricating
themselves
from, they hurry to the
gaming table, and finding their expectations
frustrated
there
also
, as the
last
resource
, betake
themselves
to a black crape, a good
horse
, and a
pistol
.
How careful
should
parents and guardians be to
instil
into the minds of youth of narrow fortunes,
meekness
, humility, and
industry
! the
least
tendency
to
thoughtless
extravagance, in either
sex
ought
to be
severely
chastised
;
since
pride, and a
passion
for
expensive
pleasures
, which they have no
laudable
method to obtain, has hurried
thousands
into
actions which imbitter the
last
hours of life with
poverty,
shame
, and
remorse
.
As I
finished
these
remarks, I looked up,
expecting
an
answer
from my companion; but
whether
my
discourse
was too grave, or whether it
touched his feelings, or whether
some
other
cause
had
occasioned
him to leave me, I know not, but
he was gone; and on my turning round to look
for him, I
saw
he was
hastily
proceeding towards
town.
How
easy
it is,
said
I, for a man to blame a
conduct in others which he is eagerly
pursuing
himself
; perhaps a few years may reduce that
young man to the
same
situation
in which he now
smiles
to
see
Woudbeexperience is undoubtedly
best
when
purchased
; but Woudbe has, I fear,
paid an exorbitant price for his.
I was now
opposite
Vellum's
house
.
The RETRIBUTION.
Having
entered, by means of my ring, I
proceeded
unseen
to
Hester
's apartment
she
was
greatly altered
since
the death of her father; a
sickly
langour had taken
possession
of her features
she
looked anxious and fatigued.
S
I wonder Harper is not returned,
said
she
to a
young woman who was with her: I hope the dear
Julietta is not
worse
.
She had hardly pronounced the words, before a
post
chaise
stopped
at the door, and, in a few
moments
,
the injured orphan entered, leaning on the
arm of an elderly woman; an
universal
trembling
seized
on
Hester
when
she
beheld the ravages
which
sickness
and ill
usage
had made on the form
of her lovely friend:
she
led her to a
sopha
, dropped
on her knees before her, and, gazing at her with a
look that
spoke
the keen
anguish
of her
soul
, took
her thin hands in hers, and
burst
into tears.
Do you not know me, my
sweet
friend?
said
she
, after a long and affecting
silence
; will you not
speak
to me, Julietta?
Hester
,
said
she
, bowing her head forward, and
leaning her cheek upon that of her weeping friend,
Hester
, why are you
so
sorrowful
? and why are
you
dressed
in black? are
you
an orphan,
Hester
?
Oh! had it
pleased
Heaven I had been, cried
Hester
,
earnestly
, rather than you, dear, injured
angel
,
had been reduced to this
hapless
state
.
Alas!
said
Julietta, why would you
wish
to be
an orphan, to have a cruel guardian, to
lose
your
brother, to eat dry bread and drink cold water, and
lie upon a wretched bed of
straw
? you could not
bear it, dear
Hester
; you would die of a broken
heartfor my part, I am
used
to it; I can bear it
very well; then let me return to my little hut
again
if
my guardian knew I had left it, he would
be very angry.
And have you
suffered
all this? cried
Hester
,
weeping bitterly. Oh! Julietta, you never
shall
return to that
sad
place again; your cruel guardian
is dead.
Dead! cried Julietta,
raising
her hands and eyes
in a
supplicating
manner; then Heaven have
mercy
on him.
And what do you think of the poor girl's
case
?
said
Hester
, as
she
re-entered the room with Dr.
M, after they had
persuaded
Julietta to go to
bed.
The doctor gave her great hopes that kind and
affectionate treatment would
soon
entirely
restore
her
reason
, which he imagined was already
beginning
to return.
Could I but
see
that happy day,
said
she
, and
deliver
her fortune into her own hands, I
should
have
no farther
business
in this world.
How
so
, my young friend?
said
the Doctor,
with a look of
surprise
; I think you have a great
deal of
business
in the world yet; why
sure
, with
all your
goodness
and
accomplishments
, you would
not
shut
yourself
up in a convent?
Why no,
said
she
; I am not a
sufficient
convert
to the catholic religion to imagine it
absolutely
necessary
to
shut
ourselves
up within the walls of a
prison
to avoid the temptations of the world; but,
I think, a
person
may in
solitude
better
practise
those
virtues
so
necessary
to our well doing
hereafter
,
than in the
noise
and hurry of the more
busy
scenes
of life.By
solitude
, I do not mean to
retire
to a
desert
, and
shut
myself
from the
converse
and
society
of my fellow creatures; I mean a calm
retirement, far from folly and
dissipation
, where I
may
consult
my own heart on the propriety and
equity of all my actions, without incurring the
sneers
and ridicule of the world. As to the wealth
which my poor unhappy father hoarded, it does not
belong to me; it is the property of the widow and
the
fatherless
.
Here her tears interrupted her.
After this declaration, Doctor,
she
continued,
you will not be
surprised
at my
resolution
of
retiring
from the gay
scenes
of life; and, I flatter
myself
,
I
shall
in time regain that
serenity
of mind a
series
of uncommon trials have robbed me of.
The Doctor was too much affected to reply;
he
pressed
her hand,
struggled
hard to
suppress
a
rising
tear, and making a
hasty
bow, left the room.
A few weeks
restored
Julietta to
reason
, health
and
spirits
; when
Hester
, having
resigned
her
fortune
to her own care, and made ample retribution
of
those
sums
her father had appropriated to his
own
use
, during the infanity of his ward, retired to
a village, in a county far
distant
from London, and
spent
the remainder of her life in
administering
to
the wants of the
helpless
and
distressed
.
Her
friendship
for Julietta
ceased
but with her
life; and many
summers
has that amiable girl
spent
with her, uniting in every action of
benevolence
,
and
shedding
peace and plenty around them;
the villagers adored them while living, and
mourned
with unaffected
sorrow
when deprived by death
of their
benefactresses
.
The CITY HEIRESS.
I WILL have the
most
elegant that is to be had,
Mamma, cried a young lady, as
she
came out of a
carriage, and ran into a milliner's
shop
, which I
had entered to buy
some
little
presents
for Harriot
and Lucy.
Do not let me detain you from waiting on the
ladies,
said
I to the
mistress
of the
shop
, for I was
willing to
see
to what lengths this girl's
extravagance
would take her.
I want a bouquet, Mrs. Frippery,
said
she
;
come,
shew
me
some
of the
handsomest
you have.
The counter was in an
instant
overspread
with
roses
, carnations, lilies,
jessamine
, and other
flowers
innumerable; it looked like the temple of
Flora
;
but I
should
by no means have taken the young
lady for the divinity of the place, as
she
was a little
swarthy
figure, with
small
black eyes, a good deal
marked with the
small
pox, and
something
inclined
to be crooked.Nature might have made her
really
so
, but her
stay
-maker had found out a method,
in a great
measure
, to hide the defect; her hair
was
dressed
to the extremity of the
fashion
; her
bonnet, which was large, and loaded with
trimming
,
placed on the left
side
of her head; a train
of rich
satin
swept
the ground as
she
walked; the
prominence of her handkerchief
almost
hid her
chin; and her cheeks wore the tints of
some
of the
best
rouge.It is
astonishing
,
said
I, as I
sat
looking
at her, that a woman to whom nature has not
been
lavish
in
personal
attractions,
should
take
such
pains by their
outre
manner of
dressing
, entirely to
obscure
the few charms with which they are
endued
,
and make their defects
conspicuous
.
I was
roused
from
these
reflections by the
Lady's
bidding five guineas for as many flowers.
But really, Mrs. Frippery,
said
she
, have you
none more elegant?
Why, my dear
Miss
,
said
the woman, I have
one, but it is
positively
bespoke
by the
Dutchess
of
Melvin, and it
likewise
comes rather high:it
cannot go out of my
shop
under
seven
guineas
though there are not more flowers in it than in the
one you have
chosen
.
The flowers were produced, the Lady
insisted
on
having them, and the money was paid.
It is a doubt with me,
said
I, whether the poor
mortal
whose
industry
and ingenuity formed
those
pretty ornaments,
scarcely
earns more than enough
to
support
nature; and yet this
thoughtless
girl has
paid
seven
guineas for them, merely
because
they
were
bespoke
by the
Dutchess
of Melvin.
Just
as the Ladies were about leaving the
shop
,
a
smart
man,
dressed
like an officer,
whose
language
spoke
him hibernian,
desired
to look at
some
point ruffles; he advanced to the counter at which
the young Lady
sat
, and while he
seemed
busy
at
looking at the ruffles, took an opportunity to
slip
a
letter into her hand unperceived by her mother.
I
shall
again have
recourse
to my ring,
said
I, for if
I am not
mistaken
, that man is a fortune-hunter.
That young Lady,
said
Mrs. Frippery, as they
drove from the door, is the only child of Alderman
Fig
she
is
heiress
to a
vast
fortune.
Two fat old gentlemen
passing
just
then,
she
informed
me that one of them was Mr. Fig
himself
.
I had made my
purchases
,
so
I
stepped
out of the
shop
and followed the Alderman.
The DISAPPOINTMENT.
I HAVE been out on
purpose
to get an appetite,
said
Mr. Fig;I think it was the
largest
turtle I
ever
saw
; and my friend Dip always has his
turtles
so
well
dressed
, that I long for the hour of
dinner
.
I will
just
step
home and change my wig, and
be with you again immediately.
Then this is the time,
said
I, for me to get
admission
.I
put my hand in my pocket for my
ringbut it was goneI
searched
every pocket
diligently, but no ring could I find. I returned to
the milliner's
shop
, and from thence home
searched
my bedhad every room in the
house
swept
; but it was all to no
purpose
.I never
saw
it again.
And pray, Mr.
Inquisitor
, what became of the
City
Heiress
?
Upon my word, Madam, I never heard.
FINIS.
