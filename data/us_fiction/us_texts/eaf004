THE BRIDE OF FORT EDWARD.
PART FIRST.
INDUCTION.
DIALOGUE I.
Scene
.
The road-side on the slope of a wooded hill near
Fort Edward. The speakers, two young soldiers,
Students in arms
.
1
st Student
.
These were the evenings last year, when
the bell
From the old college tower, would find us still
Under the shady elms, with sauntering step
And book in hand, or on the dark grass stretched,
Or lounging on the fence, with skyward gaze
Amid the sunset warble. Ah! that world,
That world we lived in thenwhere is it now?
Like earth to the departed dead, methinks.
2
nd Stud
.
Yet oftenest, of that homeward path I think,
Amid the deepening twilight slowly trod,
And I can hear the click of that old gate,
As once again, amid the chirping yard,
I see the summer rooms, open and dark,
And on the shady step the sister stands,
Her merry welcome, in a mock reproach,
Of Love's long childhood breathing. Oh this year,
This year of blood hath made me old, and yet,
Spite of my manhood now, with all my heart,
I could lie down upon this grass and weep
For those old blessed times, the times of peace again.
1
st Stud
.
There will be weeping, Frank, from older
eyes,
Or e'er again that blessed time shall come.
Hearts strong and glad now, must be broke ere then:
Wild tragedies, that for the days to come
Shall faery pastime make, must yet ere then
Be acted here; ay, with the genuine clasp
Of anguish, and fierce stabs, not buried in silk robes,
But in hot hearts, and sighs from wrung souls' depths.
And they shall walk in light that we have made,
They of the days to come, and sit in shadow
Of our blood-reared vines, not counting the wild cost.
Thus 'tis: among glad ages many,one
In garlands lies, bleeding and bound. Times past,
And times to come, on ours, as on an altar
Have laid down their griefs, and unto us
Is given the burthen of them all.
2
nd Stud
.
And yet,
See now, how pleasantly the sun shines there
Over the yellow fields, to the brown fence
Its hour of golden beautygiving still.
And but for that faint ringing from the fort,
That comes just now across the vale to us,
And this small band of soldiers planted here,
I could think this was peace, so calmly there,
The afternoon amid the valley sleeps.
1
st Stud
.
Yet in the bosom of this gentle time,
The crisis of an age-long struggle heaves.
2
nd Stud
.
Age-long?
Why, this land's history can
scarce
Be told in ages, yet.
1
st Stud
.
But this war's can.
In that small isle beyond the sea, Francis,
Ages, ages ago, its light first blazed.
This is the war. Old, foolish, blind prerogative,
In ermines wrapped, and sitting on king's thrones;
Against young reason, in a peasant's robe
His king's brow hiding. For the infant race
Weaves for itself the chains its manhood scorns,
(When time hath made them adamant, alas!)
The reverence of humanity, that gold
Which makes power's glittering round, ordained of God
But for the lovely majesty of right,
Unto a mad usurper, yielding, all,
Making the low and lawless will of man
Vicegerent of that law and will divine,
Whose image only, reason hath, on earth.
This is the struggle:
here,
we'll fight it out.
'Twas all too narrow and too courtly
there;
In sight of that old pageantry of power
We were, in truth, the children of the past,
Scarce knowing our own time: but here, we stand
In nature's palaces, and we are
men;
Here, grandeur hath no younger dome than this;
And now, the strength which brought us o'er the deep,
Hath grown to manhood with its nurture here,
Now that they heap on us abuses, that
Had crimsoned the first William's cheek, to name,
We're ready nowfor our last grapple with blind power.
[Exeunt.
DIALOGUE II.
Scene
. The same. A group of ragged soldiers in
conference
.
1
st Soldier
.
I am flesh and blood myself, as well as
the rest of you, but there is no use in talking. What
the devil would you do?You may talk till dooms-day,
but what's to hinder us from serving our time out?
and that's three months yet. Ay, there's the point.
Show me that.
2
nd Sol
.
Three months! Ha, thank Heaven mine is
2*
up to-morrow; and, I'll tell you what, boys, before the
sun goes down to-morrow night, you will see one Jack
Richards trudging home,trudging home, Sirs! None of
your bamboozling, your logic, and your figures. A good
piece of bread and butter is the figure for me. But you
should hear the Colonel, though, as the time draws
nigh. Lord! you'd think I was the General at least.
Humph, says I.
3
d Sol
.
Ay, ay,feed you on sugar-candy till they get
you to sign, and then comes the old shoes and
moccasins
.
2
nd Sol
.
And that's true enough, Ned. I've eaten
myself
,
no less than two very decent pair in the service. I'll
have it out of Congress yet though, I'll be hanged if I
don't. None of your figures for me! I say, boys, I am
going home.
1
st Sol
.
Well, go home, andcan't any body else
breathe? Why don't you answer me, John?What
would you have us do?
4
th Sol
.
Ask Will Wilson there.
1
st Sol
.
Will?Where is he?
4
th Sol
.
There he stands, alongside of the picket there,
his hands in his pockets, whistling, and looking as wise
as the dragon. Mind you, there's always something
pinching at the bottom of that same whistle, though its
such a don't-care sort of a whistle too. Ask Will, he'll
tell you.
3
d Sol
.
Ay, Will has been to the new quarters to-day.
See, he's coming this way.
5

And he saw Striker there, fresh from the

All up there, Sirs. A gone horse!and he
that turns his coat first, is the best fellow.

Shall I?
All

Ay, ay, What is it?
6
th Sol
.
That we are a cowardly, sneaking,
good-for-nothing
pack of poltroons, here in the north. There's
for you! There's what you get for your pains, Sirs.
And for the rest, General Schuyler is to be disgraced, and
old Gates is to be set over us again, andno matter for
the rest. See here, boys. Any body coming? See here.

What has he got there?

The Proclamation! The Proclamation!
Will you be good enough to let me see if there is
not a picture there somewhere, with an Indian and a
tomahawk?

DIALOGUE III.
Scene.
The same.
1
st Officer
.
I cannot conceal it from you, Sir; there is
but one feeling about it, as far as I can judge, and I had
some chances in my brief journey
2
nd Off
.
Were you at head-quarters?
1
st Off
.
Yes,and every step of this retreating army
only makes it more desperate. I never knew any thing
like the mad, unreasonable terror this army inspires.
Burgoyne and his Indians!
Burgoyne and the
Indians
!
there
is not a girl on the banks of the
Connecticut
that does not expect to see them by her father's
door ere day-break. Colonel Leslie, what were those
men concealing so carefully as we approached just now?
Did you mark them?
2nd Off
.
Yes. If I am not mistaken, it was the
paper we were speaking of.
1
st Off
.
Ay, ay,I thought as much.
2nd Off
.
General Arnold, I am surprised you should
do these honest men the injustice to suppose that such
an impudent, flimsy, bombastic tirade as that same
proclamation
of Burgoyne's, should have a feather's weight
with any mother's son of them.
Arnold
.
A feather's, ay a feather's, just so; but when
the scales are turning, a feather counts too, and that is
the predicament just now of more minds than you think
for, Colonel Leslie. A pretty dark horizon around us just
now, Sir,another regiment goes off to-morrow, I hear.
Hey?
Leslie
.
Why, no. At least we hope not. We think
we shall be able to keep them yet, unlessthat paper
might work some mischief with them perhaps, and it
would be rather a fatal affair too, I mean in the way of
example.These Green Mountain Boys
Arnold
.
Colonel Leslie, Colonel Leslie, this army is
melting away like a snow-wreath. There's no denying
it. Your General misses it. The news of one brave
battle would send the good blood to the fingers' ends
from ten thousand chilled hearts; no matter how fearful
the odds; the better, the better,no matter how large
the loss;for every slain soldier, a hundred better would
stand on the field;
Leslie
.
But then
Arnold
.
By all that's holy, Sir, if I were head here,
the red blood should smoke on this grass ere to-morrow's
sunset. I would have battle here, though none but the
birds of the air were left to carry the tale to the nation.
I tell you, Colonel Leslie, a war, whose resources are
only in the popular feeling, as now, and for months to
come, this war's must be; a war, at least, which depends
wholly upon the
unselfishness
of a people, as this war
does, can be kept alive by excitement only. It was
wonderful enough indeed, to behold a whole people, the
low and comfort-loving too, in whose narrow lives that
little world which the sense builds round us, takes such
space, forsaking the tangible good of their merry firesides,
for rags and wretchedness,poverty that the thought of
the citizen beggar cannot reach,the supperless night
on the frozen field; with the news perchance of a home
in ashes, or a murdered household, and, last of all, on some
dismal day, the edge of the sword or the sharp bullet
ending all;and all in defence ofwhat?an ideaan
abstraction,a thought:I say this was wonderful
enough, even in the glow of the first excitement. But
now that the Jersey winter is fresh in men's memories,
and Lexington and Bunker Hill are forgotten, and all
have found leisure and learning to count the cost; it
were expecting miracles indeed, to believe that this army
could hold together with a policy like this. Every step
of this retreat, I say again, treads out some lingering
spark of enthusiasm. Own it yourself. Is not this
army dropping off by hundreds, and desertion too,
increasing every hour, thinning your own ranks and
swelling your foes?and that, too, at a crisisColonel
Leslie, retreat a little further, some fifty miles further;
let Burgoyne once set foot in Albany, and the business
is done,we may roll up our pretty declaration as fast
as we please, and go home in peace.
Leslie
.
General Arnold, I have heard you to the
end, though you have spoken insultingly of councils in
which I have had my share. Will you look at this little
clause in this paper, Sir. The excitement you speak of
will come ere long, and that at a rate less ruinous than
this whole army's loss. There's a linethere's a line,
Sir, that will make null and void, very soon, if not on
the instant, all the evil of these golden promises.
There'll be excitement enough ere long; but better blood
than that shed in battle fields must flow to waken it.
Arnold
.
I hardly understand you, Sir. Is it this threat
you point at?
Leslie
.
Can't you see?They have let loose these
hell-hounds upon us, and butchery must be sent into our
soft and innocent homes;beings that we have sheltered
from the air of heaven, brows that have grown pale at
the breath of an ungentle word, must meet the red knife
of the Indian now. Oh God, this is war!
Arnold
.
I understand you, Colonel Leslie. There
was a crisis like this in New Jersey last winter, I know,
when our people were flocking to the royal standard, as
they are now, and a few fiendish outrages on the part of
the foe changed the whole current in our favor. It may
be so now, but meanwhile
Leslie
.
Meanwhile, this army is the hope of the
nation, and must be preserved. We are wronged, Sir.
Have we not done all that men could do? What were
twenty pitched battles to such an enemy, with a force
like ours, compared with the harm we have done them?
Have we not kept them loitering here among these hills,
wasting the strength that was meant to tell in the
quivering
fibres of men, on senseless trees and stones,
paralyzing them with famine, wearying them with
unexciting
,
inglorious toil, until, divided and dispirited, at
last we can measure our power with theirs, and fight,
not in vain? Why, even now the division is planning
there, which will bring them to our feet. And what to
us, Sir, were the hazards of one bloody encounter, to
the pitiful details of this unhonored warfare?We are
wrongedwe are wronged, Sir.
Arnold
.
There is some policy in the plan you speak
of,certainly, there is excellent policy in it if one had
the patience to follow it out; but then you can't make
Congress see it, or the people either; and so, after all,
your General is superseded. Well, well, at all events he
must abandon this policy now,it's the only chance left
for him.
Leslie
.
Why; howso?
3
Arnold
.
Or else, don't you see?just at the point
where the glory appears, this eastern hero steps in,
and receives it all; and the laurels which he has been
rearing so long, blow just in time to drop on the brow of
his rival.
Leslie
.
General Arnold,excuse me, Siryou do
not understand the man of whom you speak. There
is a substance in the glory he aims at, to which,
all that you call by the name is as the mere shell
and outermost rind. Good Heavens! Do you think
that, for the sake of his own individual fame, the
man would risk the fate of this great enterprize?What
a mere fool's bauble, what an empty shell of honor,
would that be. If I thought he would
Arnold
.
It might be well for you to lower your voice
a little, Sir; the gentleman of whom you are speaking is
just at hand.
[Other officers are seen emerging from the woods.]
3
d Off
.
Yes, if this rumor holds, Lieutenant Van
Vechten, your post is likely to become one of more honor
than safety. GentlemenHa!General Arnold! You
are heartily welcome;I have been seeking you, Sir.
If this news is any thing, the movement that was
planned
for Wednesday, we must anticipate somewhat.
Leslie
.
News from the enemy, General?
Gen. Schuyler
.
Staythose scouts must be coming
in, Van Vechten. Why, we can scarce call it news yet, I
suppose; but if this countryman's tale is true, Burgoyne
himself, with his main corps, is encamping at this moment
at the Mills, scarce three miles above us.
Arnold
.
Ay, and good news too.
Leslie
.
But that cannot be, SirAlaska
Gen. Schuyler
.
Alaska has broken faith with us if it is,
and the army have avoided the delay we had planned
for them.That may be.This man overheard their
scouts in the woods just below us here.
Arnold
.
And if it is,do you talk of retreat, General
Schuyler? In your power now it lies, with one hour's
work perchance, to make those lying enemies of yours
in Congress eat the dust, to clear for ever your blackened
fame. Why, Heaven itself is interfering to do you right,
and throwing honor in your way as it were! Do you talk
of retreat, Sir, now?
Gen. Schuyler
.
Heaven has other work on hand just
now, than righting
the wrongs
of such heroes as you and I,
Sir. Colonel ArnoldI beg your pardon, Sir, Congress
has done you justice at last I see,General Arnold, you
are right as to the consequence, yet, for all that, if this
news is true, I must order the retreat. My reputation
I'll trust in God's hands. My honor is in my own
keeping
.
[Exeunt Schuyler, Leslie, and Van Vechten.
Arnold
.
There's a smoke from that chimney; are
those houses inhabited, my boy?
Boy
.
Part of them, Sir. Some of our people went off
to-day. That white house by the orchardthe old
parsonage
there? Ay, there are ladies there Sir, but I heard
Colonel Leslie saying this morning 'twas a sin and a
shame for them to stay another hour.
Arnold
.
Ay, Ay. I fancied the Colonel was not
dealing
in abstractions just now.
[Exeunt.
DIALOGUE IV.
[
Scene
. A room in the Parsonage,an old-fashioned
summer parlor.On the side a door and windows
opening into an orchard, in front, a yard filled with
shade trees. The view beyond bounded by a hill
partly wooded. A young girl, in the picturesque
costume of the time, lies sleeping on the antique sofa.
Annie sits by a table, covered with coarse
needle-work
,
humming snatches of songs as she works.
Annie,
(
singing
.)
Soft peace spreads her wings and flies weeping away
.
Soft peace spreads her wings and flies weeping away
.
And flies weeping away
.
The red cloud of war o'er our forest is scowling,
Soft peace spreads her wings and flies weeping away
.
Come blow the shrill bugle, the war dogs are
howling
,
Already they eagerly snuff out their prey
The red cloud of warthe red cloud of war
Yes, let me see now,with a little plotting this might
make twotwo, at least,and then
The red cloud of war o'er our forest is scowling,
Soft peace spreads her wings and flies weeping away
.
The infants affrighted cling close to their mothers,
The youths grasp their swords, and for combat
prepare
;
While beauty weeps fathers, and lovers, and brothers,
Who are gone to defend
Alas! what a golden, delicious afternoon is blowing
without there, wasting for ever; and never a glimpse of
it. Delicate work this! Here's a needle might serve for
a genuine stiletto! No matter,it is the cause,it is
the cause that makes, as my mother says, each stitch in
this clumsy fabric a grander thing than the flashing of
the bravest lance that brave knight ever won.
(
Singing
)
The brooks are talking in the dell,
Tul la lul, tul la lul,
3*
The brooks are talking low, and sweet,
Under the boughs where th' arches meet;
Come to the dell, come to the dell,
Oh come, come
.
The birds are singing in the dell,
Wee wee whoo, wee wee whoo;
The birds are singing wild and free,
In every bough of the forest tree,
Come to the dell, come to the dell,
Oh come, come
.
And there the idle breezes lie,
Whispering, whispering,
Whispering with the laughing leaves
.
And nothing says each idle breeze,
But come, come, come, O lady come,
Come to th' dell
.
[Mrs. Grey enters from without.]
Mrs. G
.
Do not sing, Annie.
Annie
.
Crying would better befit the times, I know,
Dear mother, what is this?
Mrs. G
.
Hush,asleepis she?
Annie
.
This hour, and quiet as an infant. Need
enough there was of it too. See, what a perfect damask
mother!
Mrs. G
.
Draw the curtain on that sunshine there.
This sleep has flushed her. Ay, a painter might have
dropped that golden hair,yet this delicate beauty is but
the martyr's wreath now, with its fine nerve and
shrinking helplessness. No, Annie; put away your hat,
my love,you cannot go to the lodge to-night.
Annie
.
Mother?
Mrs. G
.
You cannot go to the glen to-night. This is
no time for idle pleasure, God knows.
Annie
.
Why, you have been weeping in earnest, and
your cheek is pale.And now I know where that sad
appointment led you. Is it over? That it should be in
our humanity to bear, what in our ease we cannot,
cannot
think of!
Mrs. G
.
Harder things for humanity are there than
bodily anguish, sharp though it be. It was not the boy,
the mother's anguish, I wept for, Annie.
Annie
.
Poor Endross! And he will go, to his dying
day, a crippled thing. But yesterday I saw him
springing
by so proudly! And the mother
Mrs. G
.
Words, words,
she answered sternly
when I tried to comfort her; ay, words are easy.
Wait till you see your own child's blood
. Wait till you
stand by and see his young limbs hewn away, and the
groans come thicker and thicker that you cannot soothe;
and then let them prate to you of the good cause.
Bitter words! God knows what is in store for us;all
day this strange dread has clung to me.
Annie
.
Dear mother, is not this the superstition you
were wont to chide?
Mrs. G
.
Ay, ay, we should have been in Albany ere
this. In these wild times, Annie, every chance-blown
straw that points at evil, is likely to prove a faithful
index
;
and if it serve to nerve the heart for it, we may call
it heaven-sent indeed. Annie,hear me calmly, my
child,the enemy, so at least goes the rumor, are nearer
than we counted on this morning, andhush, not a word.
Annie
.
She is but dreaming. Just so she murmured
in her sleep last night; twice she waked me with the
saddest cry, and after that she sat all night by the
window
in her dressing-gown, I could not persuade her to
sleep again. Tell me, mother, you say
and
and what?
Mrs. G
.
I cannot think it true, 'tis rumored though,
that these savage neighbors of ours have joined the
enemy.
Annie
.
No! no! Has Alaska turned against us?
Why, it was but yesterday I saw him with Leslie in
yonder field. 'Tis false; it must be. Surely he could
not harm us.
Mrs. G
.
And false, I trust it is. At least till it is
proved otherwise, Helen must not hear of it.
Annie
.
And why?
Mrs. Grey
.
She needs no caution, and it were useless
to add to the idle fear with which she regards them all,
already. Some dark fancy possesses her to-day; I have
marked it myself.
Annie
.
It is just two years to-morrow, mother,
since
Helen's wedding day, or rather, that sad day that should
have seen her bridal; and it cannot be that she has quite
forgotten Everard Maitland. Alas, he seemed so noble!
Mrs. G
.
Hush! Never name him. Your sister is
too high-hearted to waste a thought on him. Tory!
Helen is no love-lorn damsel, child, to pine for an
unworthy
love. See the rose on that round cheek,it
might teach that same haughty loyalist, could he see her
now, what kind of hearts 'tis that we patriots wear,
whose strength they think to trample. Where are you
going, Annie?
Annie
.
Not beyond the orchard-wall. I will only
stroll down the path here, just to breathe this lovely air
a little; indeed, there's no fear of my going further now.
[Exit.
Mrs. G
.
Did I say right, Helen? It cannot be
feigned
.
Those quick smiles, with their thousand lovely
meanings; those eyes, whose beams lead straight to the
smiling soul. Principle is it? There is no principle in
this, but joy, or else it strikes so deep, that the joy grows
up from it, genuine, not feigned; and yet I have found
her weeping once or twice of late, in unexplained agony.
Helen!
Helen
.
Oh mother! is it you? Thank God. I
thought
Mrs. G
.
What did you think? What moves you
thus?
Helen
.
I thought'tis nothing. This
is
very strange.
Mrs. G
.
Why do you look through that window thus?
There's no one there! What is it that's so strange?
Helen
.
Is it to-morrow that we go?
Mrs. G
.
To Albany? Why, no; on Thursday. You
are bewildered, Helen! surely you could not have
forgotten
that.
Helen
.
I wish it was to-day. I do.
Mrs. G
.
My child, yesterday, when the question was
debated here, and wishing might have been of some
avail, 'tis true you did not say much, but I thought, and
so we all did, that you chose to stay.
Helen
.
Did you? Mother, does the road to Albany
wind over a hill like that?
Mrs. G
.
Like what, Helen?
Helen
.
Like yonder wooded hill, where the soldiers
are stationed now?
Mrs. G
.
Not that I know of? Why?
Helen
.
Perhaps we may cross that very hill,no
could we?
Mrs. G
.
Not unless we should turn refugees, my
love; an event of which there is little danger just now, I
think. That road, as indeed you know yourself, leads
out directly to the British camp.
Helen
.
Yesyesit does. I know it does. I will
not yield to it. 'Tis folly, all.
Mrs. G
.
You talk as though you were dreaming still,
my child. Put on your hat, and go into the garden for
a little, the air is fresh and pleasant now; or take a ramble
through the orchard if you will, you might meet Annie
there,no, yon she comes, and well too. It's quite
time that I were gone again. I wish that we had nothing
worse than dreams on hand. Helen, I must talk with
you about these fancies; you must not thus unnerve
yourself for real evil.
[Exit.
Helen
.
It were impossible,it could not be!how
could it be?Oh! these are wild times. Unseen powers
are crossing their meshes here around us,and, what
am I?Powers?there's but one Power, and that
He careth for the little bird,
Far in the lone wood's depths, and though dark weapons
And keen eyes are out, it falleth not
But at his will.

A squirrel it is, Sir; there he sits.
Off
.
By keeping this path you avoid the picket on
the hill. It will bring you out where these woods skirt
the vale, and scarcely a hundred rods from the house
itself.
[Calling without.]
Sol
.
Captain AndreSir.
Off
.
It were well that the pacquet should fall into no
other hands. With a little caution there is no danger.
It will be twilight ere you get out of these woods
Sol
.
I beg your pardon, Sir; but here is that young
Indian guide of mine, after all, above there, beckoning me.
Off
.
Stayyou will come back to the camp ere
midnight
?
Sol
.
Unless some of these quick-eyed rebels see through
my disguise.
Off
.
Do not forget the lodge as you return. A little
hut of logs just in the edge of the woods, but Siganaw
knows it well.
[Exit the Soldier.
(
The call in the thicket above is repeated, and
another
young officer enters the glen
.)
2nd Off
.
Hillo, Maitland! These woods yield fairies,
come this way.
1st Off
.
For God's sake, Andre!
(
motioning silence
.)
Are you mad?
Andre
.
Well, who are they?
Mait
.
Who?
Have you forgotten that we are on the
enemy's ground? Soldiers from the fort, no doubt.
They have crossed that opening twice since we stood
here.
4
Andre
.
Well, let them cross twice more. I would run
the risk of a year's captivity, at least, for one such glimpse.
Nay, come, she will be gone.
Mait
.
Stay,not yet. There, again!
Andre
.
Such a villainous scratching as I got in that
pass just now. It must have cost the rogues an infinite
deal of pains though. A regular, handsome sword-cut
is nothing to a dozen of these same ragged scratches,
that a man can't swear about. After all, Captain
Maitland
,
these cunning Yankees understand the game.
They will keep out of our way, slyly enough, until we
are starved, and scratched, and fretted down to their
proportions
,
meanwhile they league the very trees against us.
Mait
.
As to that, we have made some leagues
ourselves
,
I think, quite as hard to be defended, Sir.
Andre
.
It may be so. Should we not be at the river
by this?
Mait
.
Sunset was the time appointed. We are as
safe here, till then.
Andre
.
'Tis a little temple of beauty you have lighted
on, in truth. These pretty singers overhead, seem to
have no guess at our hostile errand. Methinks their
peaceful warble makes too soft a welcome for such
warlike
comers. Hark!
[
Whistling
.]
That's American.
One might win bloodless laurels here. Will you stand
a moment just as you are, Maitland;'tis the very thing.
There's a little space in my unfinished picture, and with
that
a la Kemble
mien, you were a fitting mate for this
young Dian here,
(
taking a pencil sketch from his
portfolio
,
)
the
beauty-breathing, ay, beauty-breathing, it's no
poetry;for the lonesome little glen smiled to its darkest
nook with her presence.
Mait
.
What are you talking of, Andre? Fairies and
goddesses!What next?
Andre
.
I am glad you grow a little curious at last.
Why I say, and your own eyes may make it good if you
will, that just down in this glen below here, not a
hundred
rods hence, there sits, or stands, or did some fifteen
minutes since, some creature of these woods, I suppose
it is; what else could it be? Well, well, I'll call no
names, since they offend you, Sir; but this I'll say, a young
cheek and smiling lip it had, whate'er it was, and
round and snowy arm, and dimpled hand, that lay
ungloved on her sylvan robe, and eyesI tell you
plainly
,
they lighted all the glen.
Mait
.
Ha? A lady?there? Are you in earnest?
Andre
.
A lady, well you would call her so perchance.
Such ladies used to spring from the fairy nut-shells, in the
old time, when the kings' son lacked a bride; and if this
were Windsor forest that stretches about us here, I might
fancy, perchance, some royal one had wandered out, to
cool the day's glow in her cheek, and nurse her
love-dream
;
but here, in this untrodden wilderness, unless
your ladies here spring up like flowers, or drop down on
invisible pinions from above, how, in the name of reason,
came she here?
Mait
.
On the invisible pinions of thine own
lady-loving
fancy; none otherwise, trust me.
Andre
.
Come, come,see for yourself. On my word
I was a little startled though, as my eye first lighted on
her, suddenly, in that lonesome spot. There she sat, so
bright and still, like some creature of the leaves and
waters, such as the old Greeks fabled, that my first
thought was to worship her; my nextof you, but I
could not leave the spot until I had sketched this; I
stood unseen, within a yard of her; for I could see her
soft breath stirring the while. See, the scene itself was
a picture,the dark glen, the lonesome little lodge, on the
very margin of the fairy lakehere she sat, motionless
as marble; this bunch of roses had dropped from her
listless hand, and you would have thought some tragedy
of ancient sorrow, were passing before her, in the
invisible
element, with such a fixed and lofty sadness she
gazed into it. But of course, of course, it is nothing to
your
eye; for me, it will serve to bring the whole out at
my leisure. Indeed, the air, I think, I have caught a little
as it is.
Mait
.
A littleyou may say it. She is there, is she?
sorrowful; well, what is't to me?
Andre
.
What do you say?There?Yes, I left her
there at least. Come, come. I'll show you one will
teach you to unlearn this fixed contempt of gentle
woman
.
Come.
Mait
.
Let go, if you please, Sir. She who gave me
my first lesson in that art, is scarcely the one to bid me
now unlearn it, and I want no new teaching as yet,
thank Heaven. Will you come? We have loitered
here long enough, I think.
Andre
.
What, under the blue scopewhat the devil
ails you, Maitland?
Mait
.
Nothing, nothing. This much I'll say to you,
that lady is my wife
.
Andre
.
Nonsense!
Mait
.
There lackedthree days, I think it was, three
whole days, to the time when the law would have given
her that name; but for all that, was she mine, and is;
Heaven and earth cannot undo it.
Andre
.
Are you in earnest? Why, are we not here
in the very heart of a most savage wilderness, where
never foot of man trod before,unless you call these
wild red creatures men?
Mait
.
You talk wildly; that path, followed a few
rods further, would have brought you out within sight of
her mother's door.
Andre
.
Ha! you have been in this wilderness then,
ere now?
Mait
.
Have you forgotten the fortune I wasted once
4*
on a summer's seat, some few miles up, on the lake above?
These Yankees did me the grace to burn it, just as the
war broke out.
Andre
.
Ay, ay, that was
here
. I had forgotten the
whereabouts. Those blackened ruins we passed last
evening, perchance;and the ladymy wood-nymph,
what of her?
Mait
.
Captain Andre, I beg your pardon, Sir. That
sketch of yours reminded me, by chance perhaps, of one
with whom some painful passages of my life are linked;
and I said, in my haste, what were better left unsaid.
Do me the favor not to remind me that I have done so.
Andre
.
Soso! And I am to know nothing more of
this smiling apparition; nay, not so much as to speak
her name? Consider, Maitland, I am your friend it is
true; but, prithee, consider the human in me. Give her
a local habitation, or at least a name.
Mait
.
I have told you already that the lady you speak
of resides not far hence. On the border of these woods
you may see her home. I may point it out to you
securely
,
some few days hence;to-night, unless you
would find yourself in the midst of the American army,
this must content you.
Andre
.
A wild risk for a creature like that! Have
these Americans no safer place to bestow their daughters
than the fastnesses of this wilderness?
Mait
.
It would seem so. Yet it is her home. Wild
as it looks here, from the top of that hill, where our men
came out on the picket just now so suddenly, you will
see as fair a picture of cultured life as e'er your eyes
looked on. No English horizon frames a lovelier one.
Andre
.
Here
? No!
Mait
.
Between that hill and the fort, there stretches a
wide and beautiful plain, covered with orchards and
meadows
to the wood's edge; and here and there a gentle
swell, crowned with trees, some patch of the old
wilderness
.
The infant Hudson winds through it, circling in
its deepest bend one little fairy isle, with woods enough
for a single bower, and a beauty that fills and
characterizes
,
to its remotest line, the varied landscape it centres;
and far away in the east, this same azure mountain-chain
we have traced so long, with its changeful light and
shade, finishes the scene.
Andre
.
You should have been a painter, Maitland.
Mait
.
The first time I beheld itone summer evening
it was, from the woods on the hill's brow;we were a
hunting party, I had lost my way, and ere I knew it
there I stood;its waters lay glittering in the sunset
light, and the window-panes of its quiet dwellings were
flashing like gold,the old brown houses looked out
through the trees like so many lighted palaces; and even
the little hut of logs, nestling on the wood's edge,
borrowed
beauty from the hour. I was miles from home;
but the setting sun could not warn me away from such
a paradise, for so it seemed, set in that howling
wilderness
,
and
Andre
.
Prithee, go on. I listen.
Mait
.
I know not how it was, but as I wandered
slowly
down the shady road, for the first time in years of
worldliness, the dream that had haunted my boyhood
revived
again. Do you know what I mean, Andre?that
dim yearning for lovelier beings and fairer places, whose
ideals lie in the heaven-fitted mind, but not in the
wilderness
it wakes in; that mystery of our nature, that
overlooked as it is, and trampled with unmeaning things
so soon, hides, after all, the whole secret of this life's dark
enigma.
Andre
.
But see,our time is well-nigh gone,this is
philosophyI would have heard a love tale.
Mait
.
It was then, that near me, suddenly I heard the
voice that made this dull, real world, thenceforth a richer
place for me than the gorgeous dream-land of childhood
was of old.
Andre
.
Ay, aygo on.
Mait
.
Andre, did you ever meet an eye, in which the
intelligence of our nature idealized, as it were, the very
poetry of human thought seemed to look forth?
Andre
.
One such.
Mait
.
That reflected your whole being; nay,
revealed
from its mysterious depths, new consciousness, that
yet seemed like a faint memory, the traces of some old
and pleasant dream?
Andre
.
Methinks the heavenly revelation itself doth that.
Mait
.
Such an eye I saw then shining on me. A
clump of stately pines grew on the sloping road-side, and,
looking into its dark embrasure, I beheld a group of
merry
children around a spring that gurgled out of the
hill-side
there, and among them, there sat a young girl clad
in white, her hat on the bank beside her, tying a wreath
of wild flowers. That was allthat was all, Andre.
Andre
.
Well, she was beautiful, I suppose? Nay, if it
was the damsel I met just now I need not ask.
Mait
.
Beautiful? Ay, they called her so.
Beauty
I had seen before; but from that hour the sun shone with
another light, and the very dust and stones of this dull
earth were precious to me.
Beautiful?
Nay, it was
she
. I knew her in an instant, the spirit of my being;
she whose existence made the lovely whole, of which
mine alone had been the worthless and despised
fragment
.
There are a thousand women on the earth the
artist might call as lovely,show me another that I can
worship.
Andre
.
Worship! This is Captain Everard
Maitland
.
If I should shut my eyes now
Mait
.
Well, go on; but I tell you, ne'ertheless, there
have been times, even in this very spot,we often
wandered
here when the day was dying as it is now,here
in her soft, breathing loveliness, she has stood beside me,
when I have,
worshipped?
nay, feared her, in her
holy beauty, as we two should an angel who should
come through that glade to us now.
Andre
.
True it is, something of the Divinity there is
in beauty, that, in its intenser forms, repels with all its
winningness, until the lowliness of love looks through it.
Wellyou worshipped her.
Mait
.
Nay, you have told the rest. I would have
worshipped
;
but one day there came a look from those
beautiful
eyes, when I met them suddenly, with a gaze that
sought the mystery of their beauty,a single look, and
in an instant the drooping lash had buried it forever;
but I knew, ere it fell, that the world of her young being
was all mine already. Another life had been forever
added unto mine; a whole creation; yet, like Eden's
fairest, it but made another perfect; a new and purer
self;
and in it grew the heaven, and the fairy-land of
my old dreams, lovelier than ever. You have loved
yourself, Andre, else I should weary you.
Andre
.
Not a bit the more do I understand you
though. You talk most lover-like; that's very clear, yet I
must say I never saw the part worse played. Why,
here's your ladye-love, this self-same idol of whom you
rave, at this moment perchance, breathing within these
woods,years tootwo mortal years it must be, since
you have seen her face; and yetyou stand here yet,
with folded arms;a goodly lover, on my word!
Mait
.
Softly, Sir! you grace me with a title to which
I can lay no claim. Lover I
was,
may be. I am no
lover now, not Inot I; you are right; I would not walk
to that knoll's edge to see the lady, Sir.
Andre
.
Well, I must wait your leisure, I see.
Mait
.
And yet, the last time that we stood together
here, her arm lay on mine, my promised wife. A few
days more, and by
my
name, all that loveliness had gone.
There needed only that to make that tie holy in all
eyes, the holiest which the universe held for us; but
needed there that, or any thing to make it such in ours.
Why, love lay in her eye, that evening, like religion,
solemn and calm.We should have smiled then at
the thought of any thing in height or depth, ending, what
through each instant seemed to breathe eternity from
its own essence;we were one,
one,
that trite word
makes no meaning in your ear,to me, life's roses burst
from it; music, sunshine, Araby, should image what it
means; what it meant rather, for it is over.
Andre
.
What was it, Maitland?
Mait
.
Oh,well,she did not love me; that was all.
So far my story has told the seeming only, but ere long
the trial came, and then I found it
was
seeming, in good
sooth. The Rebellion had then long been maturing, as
you know; but just then came the crisis. It was the
one theme everywhere. Of course I took my king's
part against these rebels, and at once I was outraged,
wronged beyond all human bearing. Her mad brother,
her's,
her's
what a world of preciousness, Andre, that
little
word once enshrined for me; and still it seems like
some broken vase, fragrant with what it held.
Andre
.
And ever with that name, a rosy flash
Paints, for an instant, all my world.
Nay, 'tis a little love-poem of my own; go on, Maitland.
Mait
.
This brother I say, quarrelled with me, though
I had borne from him unresentingly, what from another
would have seemed insult. We quarrelled at last, and
the house was closed against me, or would have been
had I sought access; for I walked sternly by its pleasant
door that afternoon, though I remember now how the
very roses that o'erhung the porch, the benched and
shaded porch, that lovely lingering place, seemed to
beckon me in. It was a breathless summer day, and the
vine curled in the open window,even now those lowly
rooms make a brighter image of heaven to me than the
jewelled walls that of old grew in the pageant of our
sabbath dreams.
Andre
.
And thus you abandoned
your love
? A
quarrel
with her brother?
Mait
.
I never wronged her with the shadow of a
doubt. Directly, that same day, I wrote to her to fix
our meeting elsewhere, that we might renew our
broken
plans in some fitter shape for the altered times.
She sent me a few lines of grave refusal, Sir; and the
next letter was returned unopened.
Andre
.
'Twas that brother! Pshaw! 'twas that
brother
,
Maitland. I'll lay my life the lady saw no word
of it.
Mait
.
I might have thought so too, perchance; but that
same day,the morning had brought the news from
Boston
,I
met her by chance, by the spring in the little grove
where we first met; andGood Heavens! she talked of
brothers!
Brothers, mother, sisters!What was their
right to mine? All that the round world holds, or the
universe, what could it be to her?that is, if she had
loved me ever; which, past all doubt, she never did.
Andre
.
Maitland! Heavens, how this passion blinds
you! And you expected a gentle, timid girl like that to
abandon all she loved. Nay, to make her home in the
very camp, where death and ruin unto all she loved, was
the watchword?
Mait
.
I beg your pardon, Sir. I looked for no such
thing. I offered to renounce my hopes of honor here for
her; a whole life's plans, for her sake I counted nothing.
I offered her a home in England too, the very real of her
girlhood's wish; my blighted fortunes since, or a home
in yonder camp,never, never. But if I had, ay, if I
5
had,that is not
love,
call it what you will, it is not love,
to which such barriers were any thing.
Andre
.
Oh well, a word's a word. That's as one
likes. Only with your definition, give me leave to say,
marvellous little love, Captain Maitland, marvellous little
you will find in this poor world of ours.
Mait
.
I'll grant ye.
Andre
.
If there is any thing like it outside of a poet's
skull, ne'er credit me.
Mait
.
Strange it should take such shape in the
creating
thought and in the yearning heart, when all reality
hath not its archetype.
Andre
.
Hist!
Mait
.
A careful step,one of our party I fancy.
Andre
.
'Tis time we were at the rendezvous. If we
have to recross the river as we came, on the stumps of
that old bridge, we had best keep a little day-light with
us, I think.
[Exeunt.
DIALOGUE II.
Scene
. A chamber in the Parsonage. Helen leaning
from the open window.
Annie enters
.
Annie
.
Helen Grey, where on earth have you been?
Wood flowers!
Helen
.
Come and look at this sunset.
Annie
.
Surely you have not, you cannot have been in
those woods, Helen: and yet, where else could this
periwinkle
grow, and these wild roses?Delicious!
Helen
.
Hear that flute. It comes from among those
trees by the river side.
Annie
.
It is the shower that has freshened every
thing, and made the birds so musical. You should
stand in the door below, as I did just now, to see the fort
and the moistened woods stands out from that black sky,
with all this brightness blazing on them.
Helen
.
'Tis lovelyall.
Annie
.
There goes the last golden rim over the
blackening
woods; already even a shade of tender mourning
steals over all things, the very children's voices under this
tree,how soft they grow.
Helen
.
Will the day come when we shall see him
sink, for the last time, behind those hills?
Annie
.
Nay, Helen, why do you mar this lovely hour
with a thought like that?
Helen
.
And in another life, shall we see light, when
his, for us, shines no more?What sound is that?
Annie
.
That faint cry from the woods?
Helen
.
No,more distant,far off as the horizon, like
some mighty murmur, faintly borne, it came.
Annie
.
I wish that we had gone to-day. I do not
like this waiting until Thursday;just one of that elder
brother's foolish whims it was. I cannot think how your
consent was won to it. Did you meet any one in your
walk just now?
Helen
.
NoYes, yes, I did. The little people where
I went, I met by hundreds, Annie. Through the dark
aisles, and the high arches, all decked in blue, and gold,
and crimson, they sung me a most merry welcome.
And such as theseseeYou cannot think how like
long-forgotten friends they looked, smiling up from their
dark homes, upon me.
Annie
.
You have had chance enough to forget them
indeed,it is two years, Helen, since you have been in
those woods before. What could have tempted you there
to-day?
Helen
.
Was there
danger
then?was there danger
indeed?I was by the wood-side ere I knew it, and
then,it was but one last look I thought to takenay,
what is it, Annie? George met me as I was coming
home, and I remember something in his eye startled me
at first; but if there was danger, I should have known of
it before.
Annie
.
How could we dream of your going there
this evening, when we knew you had never set your
foot in those woods since the day Everard Maitland left
Fort Edward?
Helen
.
Annie!
Annie
.
For me, I would as soon have looked to see
Maitland himself coming from those woods, as you.
Helen
.
Annie! Annie Grey! You must not, my
sister
do
not speak that name to me, never again,
never
.
Annie
.
Why, Helen, I am sorry to have grieved you
thus; but I thoughtLook! look! There go those
officers
again,there, in the lane between the orchards.
Scarcely half an hour ago they went by to the fort in
just such haste. There is something going on there, I
am sure.
(Helen rises from the window, and walks the room.
Annie
.
In truth there was a rumor this afternoon,
you are so timid and fanciful, our mother chose you
should not hear it while it was rumor only; but 'tis said
that a party of the enemy have been seen in those woods
5*
to-day, and, among them, the Indians we have counted
so friendly. Do you hear me, Helen?
Helen
.
That he should
live
still! Yes, it is all real
still! That heaven of my thought, that grows so like a
pageant to me, is still
real
somewhere. Those eyes
they are darkly shining now; this very moment that
passes
me,
drinks their beauty;that voice,that tone,
that very toneon some careless ear, even now it wastes
its luxury of blessing. Continents of hail and darkness,
the polar seasall earth's distance, could never have
parted me from him; but now I live in the same world
with him, and the everlasting walls blacken between
us. Those looks may shine on the dull earth and
senseless
stones, but not on me; on uncaring eyes, but not on
mine; though for one moment of their lavished wealth,
I could cheaply give a life without them; never again,
never, never, never shall their love come to me.
Annie
.
Who would have thought she could cherish in
secret a grief like this? Dear sister, we all believed
you had forgotten that sad affair long ago,we thought
that you were happy now.
Helen
.
Happy?I am, you were right; but I have been
to-day down to the very glen where we took that last
lovely walk together, and all the beautiful past came
back to me like life.I
am
happy; you must count me
so still.
Annie
.
With what I have just now heard, how can I?
Helen
.
It is this war that has parted us; and so, this
is but my part in these noble and suffering times, and
that great thought reaches over all my anguish. But for
this war I might have beenhath this world such
flowers
,
and do they call it a wilderness?I might have been,
even now, you know it, Annie, his wife, his wife,
his
.
But our hearts are cunningly made, many-stringed; and
often much good music is left in them when we count
them broken. That which makes the bitterness of this
ot, the inconceivable, unutterable bitterness of it, even
that I can bear now, calmly, and count it God's kindness
too.
Annie
.
I do not understand you, sister.
Helen
.
What if this young royalist, Annie, when he
quarrelled with my brother, and took arms against my
country, what if he had kept faith to
me?
Annie
.
Well.
Helen
.
Well?
Oh no, it would not have been well.
Why, my home would have been with that pursuing
army now, my fate bound up with that hollow cause,
these very hands might have fastened the sword of
oppression
;
nay, the sword whose edge was turned against
you, against you all, and against the cause, that with
tears, night and morning, you were praying for, and with
your heart's best blood stood ready to seal every hour.
No, it is best as it is; or if my wish grows deeper still, if
in my heart I envy, with murmuring thought, the blessed
brides, on whose wedding dawns the laughing sun of
peace, then with a wish I cast away the glory of these
suffering times.It is best as it is. I am content.
Annie
.
I wish I could understand you, Helen. You
say, if he had kept faith to you;carried you off, you
mean! Do you mean, sister Helen, that of your own
will you would ever have gone with him, with Everard
Maitland,that traitor?
Helen
.
Gone with him?
Would I not? Would I
not? Dear child, we talk of what, as yet, you know
nothing
of. Gone with
him?
Some things are holy,
Annie
,
only until the holier come.
Annie
.
(
looking toward the door
.)
Stay, stay. What
is it, George?
(George Grey comes in.)
George
.
I was seeking our mother. What should it
be, but ill news? This tide is against us, and if it be
not well-night full, we may e'en fold our arms for the rest.
There, read that.
(
Throwing her a letter
.)
Every face you see looks as if a
thunder-cloud
were
passing it. I heard one man say, just now, as I came in,
that the war would be over in a fortnight's time.
There'll be some blood spilt ere then, I reckon though.
Helen
.
What paper is that that reddens her cheek so
suddenly?
Annie
.
The McGregor's!think of it, Helen,gone
over to the British side, and St. John of the Glens, and
who brought you this letter, George? 'Tis false! I
do not believe it, not a word of it. Why, here are
twenty
names, people that we know, the most honorable, too,
forsaking us now, at such a crisis!
George
.
Self-defence, self-defence, sister; their lands
and their houses must be saved from devastation. What
sort of barracks think you, would that fine country-seat of
McGregor's make?and St. John's
he
is a farmer you
know, and his fields are covered with beautiful grain,
that a week will ripen, and so, he is for turning his sword
into a sickle;besides, there are worse things than
pillage
threatened here. Look,
(
unfolding a hand-bill
.)
Just at this time comes this villainous proclamation
from Skeensborough, scattered about among our soldiers
nobody knows how, half of them on the eve of desertion
before, and the other halfwhat ails you, Helen?
Helen
.
There he stands!
Annie
.
Is she crazed? Why do you clasp your hands
so wildly? for Heaven's sake, Helen!her cheek is
white as death.Helen!
Helen
.
Is he gone, Annie?
Annie
.
As I live, I do not know what you are talking
of. Nay, look; there is no one here, none that you
need fear, most certainly.
Helen
.
I saw him, his eye was on me; there he
stood, looking through that window, smiling and
beckoning
me.
George
.
Saw him?
Who,
in Heaven's name? This
is fancy-work.
Helen
.
I saw him as I see you now. He stood on
that roof,an Indian,I saw the crimson bars on his
face, and the blanket, and the long wild hair on his
shoulders; andand, I saw the gleaming knife in his
girdle,Oh God! I did.
George
.
Ay, ay, 'twas that scoundrel that dogged us
in our way home, I'll lay my life it was.
Helen
.
In our way home? An
Indian,
I said.
George
.
Well, well, and I say an Indian, a rascal
Indian
,
was watching and following us all the way home
just now.
Helen
.
George!
George
.
Then you did not see him after all. In truth,
I did not mean you should, for we could not have hurried
more, but all the time we sat in that shanty, while it
rained, about as far off as that chair from me, stood this
same fellow among the bushes, watching us, or rather
you. And you saw him here? He might have crept
along by that orchard wall. What are you laughing at,
Annie?I will go and see what sort of a guard we
have.
Annie
.
If you knew as much of Helen's Indians as I
do, you would hardly be in such a hurry, George, I mean
about this one that was here just now, for there are
Indians
in yonder forest I suppose; but since we were so
high, I never walked in the woods with her once, but
that we encountered one, or heard his steps among the
bushes at least; and if it chanced to be as late as this,
there would be half a dozen of them way-laying us in
the road,but sometimes they turned out squirrels,
and sometimes logs of wood, and sometimes mere air,
air of about this color. We want a little light, that is all.
There is no weapon like that for these fancy-people. I
can slay a dozen of them with a candle's beams.
(George goes out.)
Helen
.
Do not laugh at me to-night, Annie.
Annie
.
But what should the Indians want of you,
pry'thee; tell me that, Helen?
Helen
.
God knows. Wait till the sun sets to-morrow,
and I will laugh with you if you are merry then.
Annie
.
Why to-morrow?because it is our last day
here? TuesdayWednesdayyes; the next day we
shall be on the road to Albany.
[Exit.
Helen
.
I am awake now. Watched me in the glen?
followed me home? Those woods are full of them.
But what has turned their wild eyes on me?
It is but one day longer;we have counted many, in
peril and fear, and
this,
is the last;even now how
softly
the fearful time wastes.
One day!
Oh God, thou
only knowest what its shining walls encircle.
(
She leans
on the window, musing silently
.)
Two years ago I
stood here, and prayed to die.On that same tree my
eye rested then. With what visions of hope I played
under it once, building bowers for fairies I verily thought
would come, and dreaming, with yearning heart, of
glorious
and beautiful things this world
hath not
. But,
that wretched day, through blinding tears, I saw the
sunlight
on its glossy leaves, and I said, `let me see that
light no more.' Surely the bitterness is deep when that
which hath colored all our unfolded being, is a weariness.
For what more hath life for me I thought, its lesson is
learned and its power is spent,it can please, and it can
trouble me no more; and why should I stay here in vain
and wearily?
It was sad enough, indeed, to see the laughing spring
returning again, when the everlasting winter had set in
within, to link with each change of the varied year,
sweet with a life's memories, such mournfulness;
laying
by, one by one, all hope's blessed spells, withered and
broken forever,the moonlight, the songs of birds, the
blossom showers of April, the green and gold of autumn's
sunset,it was sad, but it was not in vain.Not in vain,
Oh God, didst thou deny that weeping prayer.
(A merry voice is heard without, and a child's face
peeps through the window that overlooks the
orchard
.)
Child
.
Look! look! sister Helen! see what I have
found on the roof of the piazza here,all covered with
wampum and scarlet, and here are feathers tootwo
feathers in it, blue and yelloweagle's feathers they are,
I guess.
Helen
(
approaching the window
.)
Let me see, Willy.
What, did you find it here?
Willy
.
Just under the window here. Frank and I
were swinging on the gate; andthere is something
hard in it, Helen,feel.
Helen
.
Yes, it is very curious; but
Willy
.
There comes Netty with the candle; now we
can see to untie this knot.
Helen
.
Willy, dear Willy, you must give it to me, you
must indeed, andI will paint you a bird to-morrow.
Willy
.
A blue-bird, will you? A real one?
Helen
.
Yes, yes;run down little climber; see how
dark it grows, and Frank is waiting, see.
Willy
.
Well. But mind you, it must be a blue bird
then. A real one. With the red on his breast, and all.
[Exit.
(She walks to the table, unfastening the envelope.)
Helen
.
What sent that thrill of forgotten life through
me then?that wild, delicious thrill? This is strange,
indeed. A sealed pacquet within! and here
(She glances at the superscription, and the pacquet
drops from her hand.)
Nono. I have seen that hand-writing in my dreams
before, but it dissolved always. What's joy better than
grief, if it pierce thus? Can never a one of all the soul's
deep melodies on this poor instrument be played out, then
trembling and jarring thus, even at the breath of its
most lovely passion.And yet, it is some cruel thing, I
know.
(The pacquet opened, discovers Helen's miniature, a
book, a ring, and other tokens.)
Cruel indeed! That little rose!He might have spared
me this. A dull reader I were, in truth, if this needed
comment,but I knew it before. He might have
spared
me this.
(She leans over the recovered relics with a burst of
passionate weeping.)
Yet, who knows
(
lifting her head with a sudden
smile
,)
some trace, some little curl of his pencil I may
find among these leaves yet, to tell me, as of old,
(A letter drops from the book, she tears it eagerly
open.)
(
Reading
.)
These cold words I understand, but
letters!
He wrote me none! Was there ever a word between
us, from the hour when he left me, his fancied bride, to
that last meeting, when, at a word, and ere I knew what
I had said, he turned on me that cold and careless eye,
and left me, haughtily and forever? And now
(
reading
)
misapprehension, has it been! Is the sun on
high again?in this black and starless nightthe
noonday
sun? He loves me still.Oh! this joy weighs like
grief.
Shall I see him again? Joy! joy! Beautiful
sunshine
joy! Who knows the soul's rich depths till joy
hath lighted them?--from the dim and sorrowful haunts
of memory will he come again into the living present?
Shall I see those eyes, looking on me? Shall I hear my
name in that lost music sound once more?His?Am
I his again? New mantled with that shining love, like
some glorious and beautiful stranger I seem to myself,
Helen
the bright and joy-wreathed thing his voice
makes that name meanMy life will be all full of that
blest music. I shall be Helen, evermore hishis.
No,it would make liars of old sages,and all books
would read wrong. A life of such wild blessedness? It
would be fearful like living in some magic land, where
the honest laws of nature were not. A life?a moment
were enough. Ages of common life would shine in it.
(
Reading again
.)
Elliston's hut?If I choose that
the return should be mutual,and the memorials of a
despised
regard can at best be but an indifferent possession;
a pacquet reinclosed directly in this same envelope,
and left at the hut of the missionary, cannot fail to reach
him safely.
Safely.Might he not come there safely then?
And might I not go thither safely too, in to-morrow's
light?
O God, let not Passion lead me now. The centre
beaming truth, not passion's narrow ray, must light me
here!But am I not his?
Once more, one horizon circles, for a day, our
longparted
destinies; another, and another wave of these
wild times will drift them asunder again, forever; and
I count myself his wife. His wife?nay, his bride, his
two years' bride, to-night, his wife, to-morrow. He must
meet me there,
(
Writing
)
at noon, I will say.I did not
think that little hut of logs should have been my
marriage-hall
;he
must meet me there, and to-morrow is
my bridal day

Annie

(
Calling
.)
Come, come,why do you sit
there scribbling so late, Helen? Come, and enjoy this
beautiful night with me. Ay, what a world of invisible
life amid the dew and darkness utters its glad voices;
even the little insect we never saw by day, makes us feel
for once the great brotherhood of being. This day week
we shall be in Albany,no more such scenes as this
then.
(Helen approaches the window, and puts her arm
gently
around her sister.)
Helen
.
No more!It was a sad word you were saying,
Annie.
Annie
.
How you startled me. Your hands are cold,
cold as icicles, and trembling too. What ails you,
Helen?
Helen
.
'Tis nothing.How often you and I have
stood together thus, looking down on that old bridge.
Summer and winter.Do you remember the cold snowy
moonlights of old, when the sound of the distant bell
had hope in it? We shall stand together thus, no more.
Annie
.
Do not speak so sadly, Helen. I cannot think
they will destroy our home in mere wantonness. Was
there not some one coming up the path just now?
Hark! there is news with that tone.
[Exit.
Helen
.
A little more, an hour perchance, and he will
read my letter. Why do I tremble thus? Is it because
I have done wrong, that these dark misgivings haunt
me? No,it is not remorse'tis very likeyet remorse
it is not. Danger, there is none. I shall but walk to the
wood-side as to-day, that little path to the hut is quickly
trod, and he will be waiting there. I shall be safe then,
safe as I care to be.Why do I stand here reasoning
thus? Safe? And if I were not, what is it to me now?
The dark plan is laid. The fearful acting now is all
that's left for me.
This must go to the lodge to-night, and ere my mother
returns;to tell them now, would be to make my scheme
impossible.
(She begins, with a reluctant air, to fold the dresses,
which are lying loose'y by her.)
Oh God! whence do these dark and horrible thoughts
grow?Nay, feeling not born of thought. That
wedding
robe looks like a shroud to me! I cannot.
Shadows
from things unseen are upon me. The future is a
night of tempest, where I hear nothing but the breaking
boughs, and the whirl and crash of the mourning blast.
Oh God! there is no refuge for the fearful, but in thee.
To theeno. If there is power in prayer of mine, hath
it not already doomed that wicked cause, my fate is
linked
with now. I cannot pray.Can I not?How the
pure strength comes welling up from its infinite depths.
Hear menot with lip service, I beseech thee now,
but with the earnestness that stays the rushing heart's
blood in its way.Hear me. Let the high cause of
right and freedom, whose sad banner, now, on yonder
hill, floats in this summer air; whose music on this soft
night-breeze is bornelet it prevailthough
I,
with all
this sensitive, warm, shrinking life; with all this
newfound
wealth of love and hope, lie on its iron way.
I am safe now.This life that I feel now, steel
cannot
reach.
(Annie enters.)
Annie
.
Dear Helen, dress yourself. It is all true!
We must go to-night, we must indeed. They are
dismantling
the fort now.Come to the door, and you can
hear them if you will; and here is word from Henry, we
must be ready before morningthe British are within
sight. Do you hear me, Helen? Do not stand looking
at me in that strange way.
Helen
.
To-night!
Annie
.
I was frightened myself at first, sadly; but
there is no danger, not the least. We shall be in Albany
to-morrow, Henry says. Come, Helen, there is no one
to see to any thing but ourselves. They are running
about like mad creatures there below, and the children
are crying, and such a time you never saw.
Helen
.
To-night! That those beautiful lips should
speak it! Take it back. It cannot be. It must not be.
Annie
.
Why do you look so reproachfully at me?
Helen, you astonish and frighten me!
Helen
.
YesyesI see it all. And why could I not
have known this one hour sooner?Even now it may
not be too late. Annie
Annie
.
Thank Heaven,there is my mother's voice
at last.
Helen
.
Annie, stay. Do not mark what I have I
said in the bewilderment of this sudden fear. Is George
below?Who brought this news?
Annie
.
One of the men from the fort.George has
not been home since you sent him to Elliston's. She is
calling me. Make haste and come down, Helen.
[Exit.
Helen
.
They will leave me alone. They will leave
me here alone. And why could I not have known this
one hour sooner?I could have bid him come to-night
If the invisible powers are plotting against me, it is well.
Could I have thought of this?and yet, how like
something
I had known before, it all comes upon me.Can I
stay here alone?Could I?No never, never! He
must come for me to-night. Perchance that pacquet
still lies at yonder hut, and it is not yet too late to recal
my letter;if it isif it is, I must find some other
messenger
.
Thank God!there is one way. Elliston can
send to that camp to-night. He canever now,He
canhe will.
[Exit.
DIALOGUE III.
Scene
. The porch. Helen waiting the return of her
messenger from the hut.
Helen
.
How quiet and soft it all lies in this solemn
light. Is it illusion?can it be?that old, familiar look,
that from these woods and hills, and from this moon-lit
meadow, seems to smile on me now with such a holy
promise of protection and love?The merry trill in this
apple-tree is the very sound that, waking from my infant
sleep in the hush of the summer midnight, of old lulled,
nay, wakened my first inward thought. Oh that my heart's
youngest religion could come again, the feeling with
which a little child looks up to these mighty stars, as the
spangles on his home-roof, while he stands smiling
beneath
the awful shelter of the skies, as under a father's
dome. But these years show us the evil that mocks that
trust.
'Tis he,What a mere thread of time separates me
from my fate, and yet the darkness of ages could not hide
it more surely. Already he has reached the lane.
Another
minute will show me all. Will the pacquet be in
his hand, or will it not? I will be calmit shall be like
a picture to me.
Ah! there is an immeasurable power about us, a
foreign
and strange thing, that answers not to the soul, that
seems to know or to heed nothing of the living suffering,
rejoicing being of the spirit. Why should I struggle
with it any longer? From my weeping childhood to this
hour, it hath set its iron bars about me; nosoftly
yielding
,
hath it not sometimes, the long, undreamed-of
vistas
opened, bright as heaven,and now, maybehow
slow he moveseven now perchance.This is wrong.
The Infinite is One. The Goodness Infinite, whose
everlasting smile lighteth the inner soul, and the Power
Infinite, whose alien touch without, in darkness comes,
they are of One, and the good know it.
The Messenger
.
(
Coming up the path
.)
Bless you, Miss! The pacquet had been gone this
hour!
Helen
.
Gone! Well.And Ellistonwhat said he?
Mess
.
I brought this note of yours back, Miss Helen.
Father Elliston was gone. Here has been an Indian
killed on Sandy Hill this evening, Alaska's own son as
it turns out, and such a hubbub as they are making about
it you never heard. I met a couple of squaws myself,
yelling like mad creatures, and the woods are all alive
with them. The priest has gone down to their village
to pacify them if it may be,so I brought the note back,
Miss Helen, for there was no one there but a little rascal
of an Indian, and I would not trust the worth of a feather
with one of them. Was I right?
Helen
.
Yes. Give it to me. How far is it to the
British
camp?
Mess
.
Why, they are just above here at Brandon's
Mills they say, that is, the main body. It can't be over
three miles, or so.
Helen
.
Three
miles! only three miles of this lovely
moonlight road between us.William McReady, go to
that camp for me to-night.
Mess
.
To the British camp?
Helen
.
Ay.
Mess
.
To the British camp! Lord bless you, Miss.
I should be shotI should be shot as true as you are a
living woman. I should be shot for a deserter, or, what's
worse, I should be hanged for a spy.
Helen
.
What shall I do!
Mess
.
And besides, there's Madame Grey will be
wanting me by this time. See how the candles dance
about the rooms there.
Helen
.
Yes, you are right. We must go in and help
them. Come,

What will you see, Margaret? Nothing
lovelier than this, I am sure. Are you not ashamed to
stand muttering there? Come here, and look at this
beautiful night.
Maid
.
La, Lady Harriet!
Lady A
.
Listen! How still the camp is now! You
can hear the rush of those falls we passed, distinctly.
How pretty the tents look there, in that deep shade.
These tuneful frogs and katy-dids must be our
nightingales
to-night. Indeed, as I stand now, I could almost
fancy that fine wood there was my father's park; nay,
methinks
I see the top of the old gray turrets peeping out
among the shadows there. Look, Margaret, do you see?
Maid
.
La! I can see woods enough, my lady, if that
is what you mean,nothing else, and I have seen
enough of them already to last me one life through. Yes,
here's a pretty tear I have got amongst them!Two
guineas and a half it cost me in London,I pray I may
never set my eyes on a wood again.
Lady A
.
This was some happy home once, I know.
See that rose-bush, and this little bed of flowers.Here
was a pretty yardthere went the fence,and there,
where that waggon stands, by that broken pear-tree,
swung the gate. And pleasant meetings there have
been at this door, no doubt, and sorrowful partings too,
and hearts within have leaped at the sound of that
gate, and merry tales have been told by that desolate
hearth. In this little lonely unthought-of place, the
mysterious
world of the human soul has unfolded,the drams
of life been played, as grandly in the eyes of angels as
in the proud halls where my life dawned. And there are
hearts that cling to this desolate spot as mine does to
that far-off home. We have driven them away in
sorrow
and fear. This is war!
Maid
.
I wonder who is fluting under that tree there,
so late. They are serenading that Dutch woman, as I
live.
Lady A
.
The Baroness, are you talking of, Margaret?
Maid
.
A baroness! Good sooth!she looks like it,
in that yellow silk, and those odious beads, fussing about.
If your ladyship will believe me, I saw her sitting in
her tent to-night, ay, in the door, feeding that wretched
child with her own hands. We can't be thankful
enough they did not put her in here with us, I'll own.
Lady A
.
Hush, hush, for shame! We might well
have spared that empty room. Come, we'll go inIt's
very late. Strange that Sir George should not be here
ere this.

has joined him just nowyes, it is he.

Stay, Colonel Hill,I beg your pardon, but
you spoke so hastily.This young Maitland is a friend
of ours, I trust there is nothing that concerns him

glen as we passed?I will send for them in the
morning
,
and we will fill the vacant hearth with these
blossoming
boughs.
Maid
.
But, herein these woods, a wife!where on
earth will he bring her from, my lady?
Lady A
.
Ay, we shall see, to-morrow we shall see,
go dream the rest.
[Exit the maid.
Lady A
.
Who would have thought it?so cold and
proud he seemed, so scornful of our sex.And yet I
knew something there lay beneath it all.Even in that
wild, gay mood, when the light of mirth filled and
o'erflowed
those splendid eyes,deeper still, I saw always
the calm sorrow-beam shining within.
That picture he showed mehow pretty it was!
The face haunts me with its look of beseeching
loveliness
.Was
there anything so sorrowful about it though?
Nay, the look was a smile, and yet a strange
mournfulness
clings to my thought of it now. Well, if the painter
hath not dissembled in itthe
painter
?no. The
spirit of those eyes was of no painter's making. From
the
Eidos
of the Heavenly Mind sprung that.
I shall see her to-morrow.Nay, I must meet her in
the outskirts of the camp,so went my promise,if
Maitland be not here ere then.
[Exit.
THOUGHTS.
Scene
. The Hill. The Student's Night-watch.
How beautiful the night, through all these hours
Of nothingness, with ceaseless music wakes
Among the hills, trying the melodies
Of myriad chords on the lone, darkened air,
With lavish power, self-gladdened, caring nought
That there is none to hear. How beautiful!
That men should live upon a world like this,
Uncovered all, left open every night
To the broad universe, with vision free
To roam the long bright galleries of creation,
Yet, to their strange destiny ne'er wake.
Yon mighty hunter in his silver vest,
That o'er those azure fields walks nightly now,
In his bright girdle wears the self-same gems
That on the watchers of old Babylon
Shone once, and to the soldier on her walls
Marked the swift hour, as they do now to me.
Prose is the dream, and poetry the truth.
That which we call reality, is but
Reality's worn surface, that one thought
Into the bright and boundless all might pierce.
There's not a fragment of this weary real
That hath not in its lines a story hid
Stranger than aught wild chivalry could tell.
There's not a scene of this dim, daily life,
But, in the splendor of one truthful thought
As from creation's palette freshly wet,
Might make young romance's loveliest picture dim,
And e'en the wonder-land of ancient song,
Old Fable's fairest dream, a nursery rhyme.
How calm the night moves on, and yet
In the dark morrow, that behind those hills
Lies sleeping now, who knows what waits?'Tis well.
He that made this life, I'll trust with another.
To be,there was the risk. We might have waked
Amid a wrathful scene, but this,with all
Its lovely ordinances of calm days,
The golden morns, the rosy evenings,
Its sweet sabbath hours and holy homes,
If the same hidden hand from whence these sprung,
That dark gate opens, what need we fear there?
Here's wrath, but none that hath not its sure pathway
Upward leading,there are tears, but 'tis
A school-time weariness; and many a breeze
And lovely warble from our native hills,
Through the dim casement comes, over the worn
And tear-wet page, unto the listening ear
Of our home sighingto the
listening
ear.
Ah, what know we of life?of that strange life
That this, in many a folded rudiment,
With nature's low, unlying voice, doth point to.
Is it not very like what the poor grub
Knows of the butterfly's gay being?
With its colors strange, fragrance, and song,
And robes of floating gold with gorgeous dyes,
And loveliest motion o'er wide, blooming worlds.
That dark dream had ne'er imaged!
Ay, sing on,
Sing on, thou bright one, with the news of life,
The everlasting, winging o'er our vale.
Oh warble on, thy high, strange song.
What sayest thou?a land o'er these dark cliffs,
A land all glory, where the day ne'er setteth
Where bright creatures, mid the deathless shades.
Go singing, shouting evermore? And yet
'Twere vain. That wild tale hath no meaning here,
Thou warbler from afar. Like music
Of a foreign tongue, on our dull sense,
The rich thought wastes.We have been nursed in tears,
Thro' all we've known of life, we have known grief,
And is there none in life's deep essence mixed?
Is sorrow but the young soul's garment then?
A baby mantle, doffed forever here,
Within these lowly walls.
And we were born
Amid a glad creation!then why hear we ne'er
The silver shout, filling the unmeasured heaven?
Why catch we e'er the rich plume's rustle soft,
Or sweep of passing lyre! Our tearful home
Hung 'mid a gay, rejoicing universe,
And ne'er a glimpse adown its golden paths?
Oh are there eyes, soft eyes upon us,
In the dark and in the day, shining unseen,
And everlasting smiles, brightening unfelt
On all our tears: News sweet and strange ye bring.
Hither we came from our Creator's hands,
Bright earnest ones, looking for joy, and lo,
A stranger met us at the gate of life,
A stranger dark, and wrapped us in her robe,
And bore us on through a dim vale.Ah, not
The world we looked for,for an image in
Our souls was born, of a high home, that yet
We have not seen. And were our childhood's yearnings,
Its strange hopes, no dreams then,dim revealings
Of a land that yet we travel to?
But thou, oh foster-mother, mournful nurse,
So long upon thy sable vest we're leaned,
Thou art grown dear to us, and when at last
At yonder blue and burning gate
Thou yieldest up thy trust, and joy at last
In her own wild embrace enfolds us once, e'en
From the jewelled bosom of that dazzling one,
From the young roses of that smiling face,
Shall we not turn to thee, for one last glimpse
Of that wan cheek, and solemn eye of love,
And watch thy stately step, far down
This dim world's fading paths? Take us, kind sorrow!
We will lean our young head meekly on thee;
Good and holy is thy ministry,
8
Oh handmaid of the Halls thou ne'er mayst tread.
And let the darkness gather round that world,
Not for the vision of thy glittering walls
We ask, nor glimpse of brilliant troops that roam
Thine ancient streets, thou sunless city,
Wrap thy strange pavillions still in clouds,
Let the shades slumber round thy many homes,
By faith, and not by sight, through lowly paths
Of goodness, sorrow-led, to thee we come.

DIALOGUE I.
Scene
. The ground before the fort. Baggage
wagons
.
Cannon dismounted. Confused sounds
within
.
A soldier is seen leaning on his rifle.
(Another soldier enters.)
2
nd Sol
.
It's morning! Look in the east there. What
are we waiting for?
1
st Sol
.
Eh! The devil knows best, I reckon, Sir.
2
nd Sol
.
Hillo, John! What's the matter there?
Here's day-break upon us! What are we waiting for?
(Another soldier enters.)
3
d Sol
.
To build a bridgethat is all.
2
nd Sol
.
A bridge?
3
d Sol
.
We shall be off by to-morrow night, no doubt of
it,if we don't chance to get cooked and eaten before
that time,some little risk of that.
2
nd Sol
.
But what's the matter below there, I say?
The bridge? what ails it?
3
d Sol
.
Just as that last wagon was going over, down
comes the bridge, Sirs, or a good piece of it at least.
What else could it do?timbers half sawn away!
2
nd Sol
.
Some of that young jackanape's work!
Aid-de-camp
!
I'd
aid
him. He must be ordering and
fidgetting
,
and fuming.Could not wait till we were over.
1
st Sol
.
All of a piece, boys!
3
d Sol
.
Humph. I wish it had been,the bridge, I
mean.
1
st Sol
.
But, I say, don't you see how every thing,
little and great, goes one way, and that, against us?
Chance has no currents like this! It's a bad side that
Providence frowns on. I think when Heaven deserts a
cause, it's time for us poor mortals to begin to think about
it.
3
d Sol
.
Now, if you are going to do so mean a thing
as that, don't talk about Heavenprythee don't.

Yankee doodle is the tune
Americans delight in,
'Twill do to whistle, sing, or play,
And just the thing for fighting.
Yankee doodle, boys, huzza
(
Breaking off abruptly
.)
I do not like the looks of it,
Will.
5
th Sol
.
Of what?
4
th Sol
.
Of the morning that begins to glimmer in the
east there.
5
th Sol
.
No? Why, I was thinking just now I never
saw a handsomer summer's dawning. That first faint
light on the woods and meadows, there is nothing I like
better. See, it has reached the river now.
4
th Sol
.
But the mornings we saw two years ago
looked on us with another sort of eye than this,it is not
the glimmer of the long, pleasant harvest day that we see
there.
5
th Sol
.
We have looked on mornings that promised
better, I'll own. I would rather be letting down the bars
in the old meadow just now, or hawing with my team
down the brake; with the children by my side to pick
the ripe blackberries for our morning meal, than standing
8*
here in these rags with a gun on my shoulder. Let
well alone.We could not though.
4
th Sol
.
(
Handing him a glass
.)
See, they are
beginning
to form again. It looks for all the world like a
funeral
train.
5
th Sol
.
What was the Stamp Act to us, or all the
acts beyond the sea that ever were acted, so long as
they left us our golden fields, our Sabbath days, the quiet
of the summer evening door, and the merry winter
hearth.
The Stamp Act
? It would have been
cheaper
for us to have written our bills on gold-leaf, and for
tea, to have drunk melted jewels, like the queen I read
of once; cheaper and better, a thousand times, than the
bloody cost we are paying now.
4
th Sol
.
It was not the money, Will,it was not the
money, you know. The wrong it was. We could not
be trampled on in that way,it was not in uswe could
not.
5
th Sol
.
Ay, ay. A fine thing to get mad about was
that when we sat in the door of a moonlight evening and
the day's toils were done. It was easy talking then.
Trampled on!
I will tell you when I was nearest being
trampled on, Andros,when I lay on the ground below
there last winter,on the frozen ground, with the blood
running out of my side like a river, and a great high
heeled German walking over my shoulder as if I had
been a hickory log. I can tell you, Sir, that other was a
moon-shiny sort of a trampling to that. I shall bear to be
trampled on in figures the better for it, as long as I live.
Between ourselves now
4
th Sol
.
There's no one here.
5
th Sol
.
There are voices around that corner, though.
Come this way.
[They pass on.
(Another group of Soldiers.)
1
st Sol
.
Then if nothing else happens, we are off now.
Hillo, Martin! Here we go againskulking away.
Hey? What do you say now? Hey, M r.Martin, what
do you say now?
2
nd Sol
.
(
Advancing
.)
What I said before.
1
st Sol
.
But where is all this to end, Sir? Tell us
thattell us that.
3
d Sol
.
Yes, yes,tell us that. If you don't see
Burgoyne
safe in Albany by Friday night, never trust me,
Sirs.
1
st Sol
.
A bad business we've made of it.
4
th Sol
.
Suppose he gets to Albany;do you think
that would finish the war?
3
d Sol
.
Well, indeed, I thought that was settled on all
hands, Sir. I believe the General himself makes no
secret
of that.
4
th Sol
.
And what becomes of us all then? We
shall go back to the old times again, I suppose;weren't
so very bad though, Sam, were they?
1
st Sol
.
We have seen worse, I'll own.
3
d Sol
.
And what becomes of our young nation here,
with its congress and its army, and all these presidents,
and gene als, and colonels, and aide-de-camps?wont it
look like a great baby-house when the hubbub is over,
and the colonies settle quietly down again?
2
nd Sol
.
Faith, you take it very coolly. Before that
can happen, do you know what must happen to you?
1
st Sol
.
Nothing worse than this, I reckon.
2
nd Sol
.
(
makes a gesture to denote hanging
.)
4
th Sol
.
What would they hang us though? Do you
think they would really hang us, John?
2
nd Sol
.
Wait and see.
1
st Sol
.
Nonsense! nonsense! A few of the
ringleaders
,
Schuyler, and Hancock, and Washington, and a
few such, they will hang of course,but for the rest,
we shall have to take the oath anew, and swallow a few
duties with our sugar and tea, and
2
nd Sol
.
You talk as if the matter were all settled
already.
1
st Sol
.
There is no more doubt of it, than that you
and I stand here this moment. Why, they are flocking
to Skeensborough from all quarters now, and this poor
fragment,this miserable skeleton of an army, which is
the only earthly obstacle between Burgoyne and Albany,
why, even this is crumbling to pieces as fast as one can
reckon. Two hundred less than we were yesterday at
this hour, and to-morrowhow many are off to-morrow?
Ay, and what are we doing the while? Bowing and
retreating, cap in hand, from post to post, from Crown
Point to Ticonderoga, from Ticonderoga to Fort
Edward
,
from Fort Edward onward; just showing them
down, as it were, into the heart of the land. Let them
get to AlbanyAh, let them once get to Albany, they'll
need no more of our help then, they'll take care of
themselves
then and us too.
2
nd Sol
.
They'll never get to Albany.
1
st Sol
.
Hey?
2
nd Sol
.
They'll never get to Albany.
1
st Sol
.
What's to hinder them?
2
nd Sol
.
We,yes we,and such as we,
cravenhearted
as we are. They'll never get to Albany until we
take them there captives.
3
d Sol
.
Then they'll wait till next week, I reckon.
1
st Sol
.
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! How many prison
ers shall we have a-piece, John? How many regiments,
I mean? They'll open the windows when we get there,
won't they? I hope the sun will shine that day. How
grandly we shall march down the old hill there, with our
train behind us. I shall have to borrow a coat of one of
them though, they might be ashamed of their captor
else.
3
d Sol
.
When is this great battle to be, John? This
don't look much like it.
4
th Sol
.
I think myself, if the General would only give
us a chance to fight
2
nd Sol
.
A chance to throw your life away,he will
never give you. A chance to fight, you will have ere
long,doubt it not. Our General might clear his
blackened
fame, by opposing
this
force to
that,
this day he
might;he will not do it. The time has not yet come.
But he will spare no pains to strengthen the army, and
prepare it for victory, and the glory he will leave to his
rival. Recruits will be pouring in ere long. General
Burgoyne's proclamation has weakened us,General
Schuyler will issue one himself to-day.
1
st Sol
.
Will he? will he? What will he proclaim?
As to the recruits he gets, I'll eat them all, skin and
bone. What will he proclaim? You see what
Burgoyne
offers us. On the one hand, money and clothing,
and protection for ourselves and our families; and on the
other, the cord, and the tomahawk, and the
scalping-knife
.
Now, what will General Schuyler set down over
against these two columns?What will he offer us?
To lend us a gun, maybe,leave to follow him from one
post to another, barefooted and starving, and for our
pains to be cursed and reviled for cowards from one end
of the land to the other. And what will he threaten?
Ha, we were cowards indeed, if we feared what he could
threaten. What thing in human nature will he speak
to?say.
2
nd Sol
.
I will tell you. To that spirit in human
nature
which resists the wrong, the fiendish wrong
threatened
there. Ay, in the basest nature that power sleeps,
and out of the bosom of Omnipotence there is nothing
stronger. It has wakened here once, and this war is its
fruit. It slumbers now. Let Burgoyne look to it that
he rouse it not himself for us. Let him look to it. For
every outrage of those fiendish legions, thank God.It
lays a finger on the spring of our only strength.
What
will he offer us? I will tell you.A chance to live, or to
die,
men,
ay, to leave a sample of manhood on the
earth, that shall wring tears from the selfish of unborn
ages, as they feel for once the depths of the slumbering
and godlike nature within them. And Burgoyne,oh!
a coat and a pair of shoes, he offers, andhow many
pounds?Are you men?
4
th Sol
.
What do you say, Sam?Talks like a
minister
,
don't he?
1
st Sol
.
Come, come,there's the drum, boys. You
don't bamboozle me again! I've heard all that before.
3

Nor me.I don't intend to have my wife and
children tomahawked,don't think I can stand that,

or not.

DIALOGUE II.
Scene
. Before the door of the Parsonage. Trunks,
boxes, and various articles of furniture, scattered
about the yard. Two men coming down the path.
(George Grey enters.)
George
.
Those trunks in the forward team. Make
haste. We've no time to lose. This box in the
wagon
where the children are.Carefullycarefully,
though.
(A Soldier enters.)

.
Hurra, hurra, the house there! Are you ready?
Ten minutes more.
George
.
Get out. What do you stand yelling there
for? We know all about it.
Sol
.
But your brother, the Captain, says, I must hurry
you, or you'll be left behind.
George
.
Tell my brother, the Captain, I'll see to that.
We want no more hurrying. We have had enough of
that already, and much good it has done us too. Stop,
stop,not that. We must leave those for the Indians to
take their tea in.
Workman
.
But the lady said
George
.
Never mind the lady. Well, Annie, are you
ready? Don't stand there crying; there's no use. We
may come back here again yet, you know. Many a
pleasant sunrise we may see from these windows yet.
Heaven defend us, here is this aunt of ours.What on
earth are they bringing now?
(A Lady in the door with a couple of portraits, followed
by others bringing baskets and boxes, etc.)
Lady
.
That will do, set them down; now, the Colonel
and his lady, on the back room wall, just over against
the beaufet. Stop a moment. I'll go with you myself.
Betty
.
(
In the door
.)
Lord 'a mercy! Here it is
broad day-light. What are we waiting for? I am all
ready. Why don't we go?

George
.
I tell you, Aunt Rachael, the thing is
impossible
.
This trumpery can't go, and there's the end of it.
St. George and the Dragon
Miss Rachael
.
Never mind this young malapertdo
as I bid you.
Betty
.
Lord 'a mercy, we shall all be murdered and
scalped, every soul of us. Bless youthere it is in the
garret now!just hold this umberell a minute, Mr.
George,think of those murderous Indians wearing my
straw bonnet. Lord bless you! What are you doing?
a heaving my umberell over the fence, in that fashion!
George
.
These women will drive me mad I believe.
Let that box alone, you rascal. Lay a finger on that
trumpery there I say, and you'll find whose orders you
are under; as for the Colonel and his lady, they'll get a
little drink out of the first puddle we come to, I reckon.
[Goes out.
Miss R
.
(
Coming from the house
.)
That will do.
That is all,in the green wagon, John
Ser't
.
But the children
Miss R
.
Don't stand there, prating to me at a time
like this. Make haste, make haste!
How perfectly calm I am! I would never have
believed
it;just tie this string for me, child, my hands
twitch so strangely,they say the British are just down
in the lane here, with five thousand Indians, Annie.
Annie
.
It is no such thing, Aunt Rachael. The
British
are quietly encamped on the other side of the river;
three miles off at least.
Miss R
.
I thought as much. A pretty hour for us to
be turned out of house and home to be sure. Not a wink
have I slept this blessed night. Hark! What o'clock
is that? George, George! where is that boy? Just run
and tell your mother, Annie, just tell her, my dear, will
you, that we shall all be murdered. Maybe she will make
haste a little. Well, are they in?
Ser't
.
The pictures? They are in,yes'm. But
Miss Kitty's a crying, and says as how she won't go,
and there's the other one too; because, Ma'am, their toes
you see there's the trunk in front gives 'em a leetle slope
inward, and then that chest under the seatIf you
would just step down and see yourself, Ma'am.
Miss R
.
I desire to be patient.
[They go out.
(Annie sits on the bench of the little Porch, weeping.
Mrs. Gray enters from within.)
Annie
.
Shall I never walk down that shady path
again? Shall I enter those dear rooms no more?
There are voices there they cannot hear. From the life
of buried years, ten thousand scenes, all vacancy to other
eyes, enrich those walls for us; the furniture that money
cannot buy, that only the joy and grief of years can
purchase
.
They will spoil our pleasant home,will they
not, mother?
Mrs. G
.
Pleasant, ay, pleasant indeed, has it been to
us. God's will be done. Do not weep, Annie. We
have counted the cost;many a safe and happy home
there will be in the days to come, whose light shall spring
from this forgotten sorrow. God's will be done.
Annie
.
Mother, they are all ready now; is Helen in
her room still?
Mrs. G
.
Go call her, Annie. Hours ago it was I sent
her there. I thought she might get some little sleep ere
the summons came. Call her, my child. How deadly
pale she was!
[Annie goes in.
DIALOGUE III.
Scene
. A Chamber partly darkened, the morning air
steals faintly through the half-open shutters. Helen
before the mirror, leaning upon the toilette, her face
buried in her hands, her long hair unbound, and
flowing on her shoulders.
(Annie enters.)
Annie
.
Helen! Why, Helen, are you asleep there?
Come, we are going now. After keeping us on tiptoe
for hours, the summons has come at last. Indeed, there
is hardly time for you to dress. Shall I help you?
Helen
.
(
Rising slowly
.)
God
help me. Bid my
mother come here, Annie.
Annie
.
What ails you, Helen?there is no time,
you do not understand me,there is not one moment to
be lost. Let me wind up this hair for you.
Helen
.
Let go!Oh God
Annie
.
Helen Grey!
Helen
.
It was a dream,it was but a foolish dream.
It must not be thought of now,it will never do. Bid
my mother come here, I am ready now.
Annie
.
Ready, Helen!ready?in that
dressing-gown
,
and your hairsee here,are you ready, Helen?
Helen
.
Yes,bid her come;
Annie
.
Heaven only knows what you mean with this
wild talk of yours, but if you are not mad indeed, I intreat
you, sister, waste no more of this precious time.
Helen
.
No, no,we must not indeed. It was wrong,
but I could notgo,make haste, bid her come.
Annie
.
She is crazed, certainly!
[Goes out.
(Helen stands with her arms folded, and her eye
fixed
on the door.)
(Mrs. Grey enters.)

.
My child! Helen, Helen! Why do you
stand there thus?
Helen
.
Mother
Mrs. G
.
Nay, do not stay to speak. Therethrow
this mantle around you. Where is your hat?not here!
Bridal gear!
(George enters.)
George
.
On my word! Well, well, stand there a
little longer, to dress those pretty curls of yours, and
humphthere's a style in vogue in yonder camp
for rebels just now; we'll all stand a chance to try,
I think.
Helen
.
George!George Grey!Be still,be still.
We must not think of that. It was a dream.
George
.
Is my sister mad?
Helen
.
Mother
Mrs. G
.
Speak, my child.

.
Mothermy blessed mother,(

but a brief word,it will be over soon.
Mrs. G
.
Speak, Helen.
Helen
.
I cannot go with you, mother.
Mrs. G
.
Helen?
George
.
Not go with us?
Mrs. G
.
Helen, do you know what you are saying?
George
.
You are in jest, Helen; or else you are mad,
before another sunset the British army will be
encamping
here.
Helen
.
Hear me, mother. A message from the
British
camp came to me last night,
Mrs. G.
The British camp?Ha!ha! Everard
Maitland! God forgive him.
Helen
.
Do not speak thus. It was but a few cold
and careless lines he sent me,my purpose is my own.
Mrs. G.
Andwhat, and he does not know?Helen
Grey, this passes patience.
Helen
.
He does. Here is the answer that has just
now come; for I have promised to meet him to-day at
the hut of the missionary in yonder woods.I can
hardly spell these hasty words; but this I know, he will
surely come for me,though he bids me wait until I
hear his signal,so I cannot go with you, mother.
Mrs. G.
Where will you go, Helen?
Helen
.
Everard is in yonder camp;where should the
wife's home be?
Mrs. G.
The wife's?
Helen
.
These two years I have been his bride;his
wedded wife I shall be to-day. Yonder dawns my bridal
day.
George
.
What does she say? What does Helen say?
I do not understand one word of it.
Mrs. G.
She says she will go to the British camp.
Desertions thicken upon us. Hark!they are calling
us.
George
.
To the British camp?
Mrs. G.
Go down, George, go down. Your sister
talks wildly and foolishly, what you should not have
heard, what she will be sorry for anon; go down, and
tell them they must wait for us a little,we will be there
presently.
George
.
Hark!
(
going to the door
.)
another
message
.
Do you hear?Helen may be ready yet, if she
will.
Mrs. G.
Blessed delay! Go down, George; say
nothing of this. There is time yet. Tell them we will
be there presently.
(George goes out.)
Mrs. G.
Did you think I should leave you here to
accomplish
this frantic scheme?Did you dream of it, and
you call me mother?but what do you know of that
name's meaning? Do not turn away from me thus, my
child; do not stand with that fixed eye as though some
phantom divinity were there. I shall not leave you here,
Helen, never.
Come, come; sit down with me in this pleasant
window
,
there is time yet,let us look at this moonlight
scheme of yours a little. Would you stay here in this
deserted citadel, alone? My child, our army are already
on their march. In an hour more you would be the only
living thing in all this solitude. Would you stay here
alone, to meet your lover too?Bethink yourself, Helen.
Helen
.
This Canadian girl will stay with me, and
Mrs. G.
A
girl!
Helen, yesterday an army's
strength, the armies of the nation, the love of mother,
and brothers, and sisters, all seemed nothing for
protection
to your timid and foreboding thought; and now,
when the enemy are all around us,do you talk of a
single girl? Why, the spirit of some strange destiny is
struggling with your nature, and speaks within you, but
we will not yield to it.
Helen
.
You have spoken truly, mother. There is one
tie in these hearts of ours, whose strength makes destiny,
and where that leads, there lie those iron ways that are
of old from everlasting. This is Heaven's decree, not
mine.
Mrs. G.
Do not charge the madness of this frantic
scheme on Heaven, my child.
Helen
.
Everard!
no, no. I cannot show to another
the lightning flash, that with that name reveals my
destiny
,yet
the falling stone might as soon question of its
way. Renounce him?you know not what you ask!
all there is of life within me laughs at the wild
impossibility
.
Mother, hear me. There is no danger in my staying
here,none real. The guard still keep their station on
yonder hill, and the fort itself will not be wholly
abandoned
to-day. Everard will come for me at noon.It is
impossible that the enemy should be here ere then; nay,
the news of this unlooked-for movement will scarce have
reached their camp.
Real
danger there is none, and
Do not urge me. I know what you would say; the
bitter
cost I have counted all, already, all
all
. That
Maitland
is in yonder camp, thatis it not a strange
blessedness
which can sweeten anguish such as this?that he
loves me still, that he will come here to-day to make me
his forever,this is all that I can say, my mother.
Mrs. G.
Will you go over to the British side, Helen?
Will you go over to the side of wrong and oppression?
Would you link yourself with our cruel and pursuing
enemy? Oh no, no no,that could not benever.
Amid the world of fearful thoughts that name brings, how
could we place your image? Oh God, I did not count
on this. I knew that this war was to bring us toil, and
want, and fear, and haply bloody death; and I could have
borne it unmurmuringly; butGod forgive me,that the
child I nursed in these arms should forsake me, and join
with our deadly foes against usI did not count on
this.
Helen
.
Yesthat's the look,the very lookall night
I saw it;it does not move me now, as it did then. It is
shadows of these things that are so fearful, for with the real
comes the unreckoned power of suffering.
Mother, this dark coil hath Heaven wound, not we.
The tie which makes his path the way of God to me,
was linked ere this war was,and war cannot undo it
now. It is a bitter fate, I know,a bitter and a fearful
one.
Mrs. G.
Ay, ay,thank God! You had forgotten,
Helen, that in that army's pay, nay, all around us even now
are hordes and legions.
Helen
.
I know it,I know it all. I do indeed.
Mrs. G.
Helen, will you place yourself defenceless
amidst that savage race, whose very name from your
childhood upwards, has filled you with such strange fear?
Yesterday I chid you for those fancies,I was wrong,
they were warnings, heaven-sent, to save you from this
doom. What was that dream you talked of then?
Helen
.
Dreams are nothing. Will you unsay a life's
lessons now when most I need them?
Mrs. G.
Yesterday, all day, a shadow as of coming
evil lay upon me, but now I remember the forgotten
vision
whence it fell. Yesternight I had a dream, Helen,
such as yours might be; for in my broken and fevered
slumbers, wherever I turned, one vision awaited me.
There was a savage arm, and over it fell a shower of
golden hair, and ever and anon, in the shadowy light of
my dream, a knife glittered and waved before me. We
were safe, but over one,some young and innocent and
tender one it wasthere hung a hopeless and inexorable
fate. Once methought it seemed the young English girl
that was wedded here last winter, and once she turned
her eye upon meHa!I had forgotten that glance of
agonysurely, Helen, it was
yours
.
Mrs. G
.
Helen! my child
(
Aside(
.)
There it is,
that same curdling glance,'twas but a dream, Helen.
Why do you stand there so white and motionlesswhy
do you look on me with that fixed and darkening eye?
'twas but a dream!
Helen
.
And where were you?tell me truly. Was it
not by a gurgling fountain among the pine trees there?
and was it not noon-day in your dream, a hot, bright,
sultry
noon, and a few clouds swelling in the western sky,
and nothing but the trilling locusts astir?
Mrs. G
.
How wildly you talk; how should I
remember
any thing like this?
Helen
.
I will not yield to it; tempt me not. 'Tis folly
all, I know it is. Danger there is none. Long ere
yonder
hill is abandoned, Everard will be here; and who
knows that I am left here alone, and who would come
here to seek me out but he? Oh no, I cannot break
this solemn faith for a dream. What would he give to
know I held my promise and his love lighter than a
dream? I must
stay
here, mother.
Mrs. G
.
No, my child. Hear me. If this must be
indeed
,
if all my holy right in you is nothing, if you will
indeed
go over to our cruel enemy, and rejoice in our
sorrows
and triumph in our overthrow
Helen
.
Hear her
Mrs. G
.
Be it so, Helen,be it so; but for all that, do
not stay here to-day. Bear but a little longer with our
wearisome tenderness, and wait for some safer chance
of forsaking us. Come.
Helen
.
If I couldAh, if I could
Mrs. G
.
You canyou will. Here, let me help you.
we shall be ready yet. No one knows of this wild
scheme but your brother and myself, no one else shall
ever know it. Come.
Helen
.
If I could. 'Tis true, I did not know when I
sent him this promise you would leave me alone ere the
hour should come. Perhapsno, it would never do.
When he comes and finds that, after all, I have deserted
him, once with a word I angered him, and for years it
was the last between us;and what safer chance will
there be in these fearful times of meeting him? No, no.
If we do not meet now, we are parted for ever;if I do
not keep my promise now, I shall see him no more.
10
Mrs. G
.
See him no more then. What is he to us
this stranger, this haughty, all-requiring one? Think of
the blessed days ere he had crossed our threshold. You
have counted
all,
Helen? The anguish that will bring
tears into your proud brother's eyes, your sister's
comfortless
sorrow?did you think of her lonely and
saddened
youth? You counted the wild suffering of this
bitter moment,did you think of the weary years, the
long sleepless nights of grief, the days of tears; did you
count the anguish of a mother's broken heart, Helen?
God only can count that.
You did notthere come the blessed tears at last.
Here's my own gentle daughter, once again. Come,
Helen, see, they are waiting for us. There stands the
old chaise under the locust tree. You and I will ride
together. Come, 'tis but a few steps down that shady
path, and we are safea few steps and quickly trod.
Hark! the respite is past even now. Do you stand
there marble still? Helen, if you stay here, we shall
see you no more. This lover of yours hates us all. He
will take you to England when the war is over if you
outlive its bloody hazards, and we are parted for ever.
I shall see you no more, Helen, my child; my child, I shall
see you no more.
(
She sinks upon the chair, and
weeps aloud
.)
Helen
.
Has it come to this? Will you break my
heart? If it were continents and oceans that you bade
me cross, but those few stepsAh, they would sever me
from him for ever, and I cannot, I cannot, I can
not
take
them,there is no motion so impossible. Yes, they are
calling us. Do not stay.
(Annie enters).
Annie
.
Mother, will you tell me what this means?
Mrs. G
.
Yes, come in. We will waste no more time
about it. She will stay here to meet her lover, she will
forsake us for a traitor. We have nursed an enemy
among us. The babe I cherished in this bosom, whose
sleeping face I watched with a young mother's love,
hath become my enemy. Oh my Godis it from thee?
Annie
.
Helen! my sister! Helen!
Mrs. G
.
Ay, look at her. Would you think that the
spirit which heaves in that light frame, and glances in
those soft eyes, held such cruel power? Yesterday I
would have counted it a breath in the way of my lightest
purpose, and nowcome away, Annieit is vain, you
cannot move her.
(George enters.)
George
.
Mother, if Helen will not go now, we must
leave her to her fate or share it with her. Every wagon
is on the rod but ours. A little more, and we shall be
too late for the protection of the army. Shall I stay with
her?
Mrs. G
.
No, never. That were a sure and idle
waste of life. Helen, perhaps, may be safe with them.
Oh yes, the refugees are safe, else desertion would grow
out of fashion soon.
Annie
.
Refugees! Refugee! Helen!
Mrs. G
.
It sounds strange for one of us I know. You
will grow used to it soon. Helen belongs to the British
side, she will go over to them to-day, but she must go
alone, for none of us would be safe in British hands, at
least I trust sothis morning's experience might make
me doubtful, but I trust we are all true here yet beside.
Annie
.
Have I heard aright, Helen?or is this all
some fearful dream? You and I, who have lived
together
all the years of our lives, to be parted this moment,
and for ever,no, no!
(A young American Officer enters hastily.)
Capt. Grey
.
Softly, softly! What is this? Are you in
this conspiracy to disgrace me, mother? Oh, very well;
if you have all decided to stay here, I'll take my leave.
Annie
.
Oh, Henry, stay. You can persuade her it may
be.
Capt. G
.
Persuade!
What's all this! A goodly
time for rhetoric forsooth! Who's this that's risking all
our lives, waiting to be persuaded now?
Mrs. G
.
That Tory, Henry! We should have thought
of this. Ah, if we had gone yesterday,that haughty
Maitland,she will stay here to meet him! She will
marry him, my son.
Capt. G
.
Maitland!and stay here!
Helen
.
Dear Henry, let us part in kindness. Do not
look on me with that angry eye. It was I that played
with you in the woods and meadows, it was I that
roamed with you in those autumn twilights,you loved
me then, and we are parting for ever it may be.
Capt. G
.
(
To the children at the door
.)
Get you
down, young ones, get you down. Pray, mother, lead
the way, will you?break up this ring. Come, Helen,
you and I will talk of this as we go on, only in passing
give me leave to say, of all the mad pranks of your novel
ladies, this caps the chief. You have outdone them,
Helen; I'll give you credit for it, you have outdone them
all.
Why you'll be chronicled,there's nothing on record
like it, that ever I heard of; I am well-read in romances
too. We'll have a new love-ballad made and set to tune,
under the head of Love and Murder, it will come
though, if you don't make haste a little. Come, come.
Helen
.
Henry!
Capt. G
.
Are you in earnest, Helen? Did you
suppose
that we were mad enough to leave you here?
You'll not go with us? But you
will,
by Heaven!
Helen
.
Henry! Mother!Nay, Henry, this is vain. I
shall stay here, I shall
I shall stay here,
so help me
Heaven.
10*
Capt. G
.
Helen Grey! Is that young lioness there
my sometime sister?my delicate sister?with her foot
planted like iron, and the strength of twenty men
nerving
her arm?
Helen
.
Let go.I shall stay here.
Capt. G
.
Well, have your way, young lady, have your
way; butMother, if you choose to leave that mad girl
here, you can,but as for this same Everard Maitland,
look you, my lady, if I don't stab him to his heart's core,
never trust me.
(He goes outMrs. Grey follows him to the door.)
Mrs. G
.
Stay, Henry,stay. What shall we do?
Capt. G
.
Do!Indeed, a straight waistcoat is the
only remedy I know of, Madam, for such freaks as these.
If you say so, she shall go with us yet.
Mrs. G
.
Hear me. This is no time for passion now
Hear me, Henry. This Maitland,
Tory
as he is, is her
betrothed
husband, and she has chosen her fate with him;
we cannot keep her with us; nay, with what we have
now seen, it would be vain to think of it, to wish it even.
She must go to him,it but remains to see that she meets
him safely. Noon is the hour appointed for his coming.
Could we not stay till then?
Capt. G
.
Impossible. Noon?well.Oh, if its all
fixed upon;if you have settled it between yourselves
that Helen is to abandon us and our protection, for
Everard Maitland's and the British, the sooner done, the
better, She's quite right,she's like to find no safer
chance for it than this. Noon,there is a picket left on
yonder hill till after that time, certainly, and a hundred
men or so in the fort. I might give Van Vechten a hint
of itnay, I can return myself this afternoon, and if she
is not gone then, I will take it upon me she is not left a
second time. Of course Maitland would be likely to
care for her safety. At all events there's nothing else
for us to do, at least there's but one alternative, and
that I have named to you.
[They go out together.
Helen
.
(
She has stood silently watching them
.)
He
has gone, without one parting lookhe has gone! So
break the myriad-tied loves, it hath taken a life to weave.
This is a weary world.
(
She turns to her sister, who leans weeping on the
window-seat
.)
Come, Annie, you and I will part in kindness, will we
not? No cruel words shall there be here. Pleasant hath
your love been unto me, my precious sister. Farewell,
Annie.
Annie
.
Shall I never hear your voice again, that
hath been the music of my whole life? Is your face
henceforth to be to me only a remembered thing? Helen,
you must not stay here. The Indians,it was no idle
fear, the half of their bloody outrages you have not heard;
they will murder you, yes,
you
. The innocence and
loveliness
that is holy to us, is nothing in their eyes, they
would as soon sever that beautiful hair from your brow
Helen
.
Hush, hush. There is no danger, Annie. The
dark things of destiny are God's; the heart, the heart
only, is ours.
(Mrs. Grey re-enters.)
Mrs. G
.
(
to Annie
)
Come, come, my child. This is
foolish now. All is ready. Janette will stay with you,
Helen.
(
Laughing voices are heard without, and the children's
faces are seen peeping in the door
.)
Willy
.
Dear mother, are you not ready yet? We have
been in the wagon and out a hundred times. Oh, Helen,
make haste. The sun is above the trees, and the grass
on the roadside is all full of diamonds. The last
soldiers
are winding down the hollow now. Is not Helen
going, Mother?
Mrs. G
.
Your sister Helen is going from us forever.
Come in and kiss her once, and then make hasteyou
must not all be lost.
(They enter.)
Willy
.
Ah, why don't you go with us, sister?Such
a beautiful ride we shall have. You never heard such a
bird-singing in all your life.
Frank
.
We shall go by the Chesnut Hollow, George
says we shall. Smell of these roses, Helen. Must she
stay here? Hark, Willy, there's the drum. Good-bye.
How sorry I am you will not go with us.
Willy
.
So am I. What makes you stand so still and
look at us so? Why don't you kiss me? Good-bye, Helen.
Helen
.
(
Embracing them silently
.)
Annie
.
Will you leave her here alone, mother? Will
you?
Mrs. G
.
No. There is a guard left on yonder hill,
and the fort is not yet abandoned wholly. Besides, the
army encamp at the creek, and Henry himself will
return this afternoon. She will be gone ere then,
though.
Helen
.
Those merry steps and voices, those little, soft
clinging hands and rosy lips, have vanished forever. For
all my love I shall be to them but as the faint trace of
some faded dream. This is a weary world.
Come, George, farewell. How I have loved to look on
that young brow. Be what my dreams have made you.
Fare you well.
George
.
Farewell, Helen.
[He goes out hastily.
Helen
.
Will
he
forget me?
Mrs. G
.
And farewell, Helen. Fare ye well.
Helen
.
Will she leave me thus?
Mrs. G
.
Do not go to the hutdo not leave this door
until you are sure of the signal you spoke of, Helen.
Helen
.
She will not look at me.Mother!
Mrs. G
.
Farewell, Helen; may the hour never come
when you need the love you have cast from you now so
freely.
Helen
.
Will you leave me thus? Is not our life
together
ending here? In that great and solemn Hereafter
our ways may meet again; but by the light of sun, or
moon, or candle, or underneath these Heavens, no more.
Oh! lovely, lovely have you been unto me, a spirit of
holiness and beauty, building all my way.Part we
thus?
Mrs. G
.
Farewell, Helen.
Helen
.
Part we thus?
Mrs. G
.
Fare ye well, Helen Grey, my own sweet
and precious child, my own lovely, lovely daughter, fare
ye well, and the Lord be with you. The Lord keep you,
for I can keep you now no more. The Lord watch over
you, my helpless one, mine, mine, mine, all mine, though
I leave you thus; my world of untold wealth, unto
another
.
Nay, do not sorrow, my blessed child,you will
be happy yet. Fear nothing,if this must be, I say, fear
nothing. You think that you are doing right in
forsaking
us thus;it may be that you are. If in the strength
of a pure conscience you stay here to-day,be not afraid.
When you lay here of old, a lisping babe, I told you of
One whose love was better than a mother's.
Now
farewell
,
and trust in Him. Farewell, mine eye shall see thee
yet again. Farewell.
Helen
.
No, no; leave me not.
Mrs. G
.
Unclasp these hands, I cannot stay.
Helen
.
Nevernever.
Mrs G
.
Untwine this wild embrace, or, even now,
even now
Helen
.
Farewell, mother. Annie Grey, farewell.
[They go.
Helen
.
This is a weary world. Take me home. To
the land where there is no crying or bitterness, take me
home.
(
The noise of retreating steps is heard, and the sound
of the outer door closing heavily
.)
Helen
.
They are gone,not to church,not for the
summer's ride. I shall see them no more.In heaven
it may be; but by the twilight hearth, or merry table, at
morn, or noon, or evening, in mirth or earthly tenderness,
no more.
Hark! There it is!that voice,I hear it now, I do.
A dark eternity had rolled between us, and I hear it yet
again. They are going now. Those rolling wheels, oh
that that sound would last. There is no music half so
sweet. Fainterfainterit is gone--nothat was but
the hollow.Hark
Now they are gone, indeed. So breaks the sense's last
link between me and that world.
PART FIFTH.
FULFILMENT.
DIALOGUE I.
Scene
. The hill. A young Soldier enters.
How gloriously, with what a lonely majesty the
morning
wastes in that silent valley there; with its moving
shadows, and breeze and sunshine, and its thousand
delicious
sounds mocking those desolate homes
(He stops suddenly, and looks earnestly into the
thicket.)
This is strange, indeed. This feeling that I cannot
analyze, still grows upon me.
Presentiment?
Some
dark, swift-flying thought, leaves its trace, and the
causeseeking
11
mind, in the range of its own vision finding none,
looks to the shadowy future for it.
[He passes on.
(
Two Indian Chiefs, in their war-dress, emerge from
the thicket, talking in suppressed tones
.)
1
st Chief
.
Hoogh! Hoogh! Alaska fights to revenge
his son,we spill our blood to revenge his son, and he
thinks to win gifts besides. Hugh! A brave chief he is!
2
nd Chief
.
Your talk is not good, Manida. They are
our enemies,we shall conquer them, we shall see their
chestnut locks waving aloft, we shall dance and shout
all night around them, and the eyes of the maidens shall
meet ours in the merry ring, sparkling with joy, as we
shout Victory! victory! our enemies are slain,our
foot is on their necks, we have slain our enemies! What
more, Manida? Is it not enough?
1
st Chief
.
No. I went last night with Alaska to the
camp above, to the tent of the young sachem of the lake,
and he promised him presents, rich and many, for an
errand
that a boy might do. I asked Alaska to send me for
him, and he would not.
2
nd Chief
.
The young white sachem was Alaska's
friend, many moons ago, when Alaska was wounded and
sick.--He must revenge young Siganaw, but he must
keep his faith to his white friend, too.
1
st Chief
.
Ah, but I know where the horse is hidden
and the paper. When the tomahawks flash here, and
the war-cry is loudest, we will steal away. Come, and I
will share the prize with you.
2nd Chief
.
No, I will tell my brother chief that
Manida
is a treacherous friend.
1st Chief
.
You cannot. It is too late. Hist! Quick,
lowerlower
[They crouch among the trees.
(Another Soldier emerges from the wood-path,
singing
,)
Then march to the roll of the drum,
It summons the brave to the plain,
Where heroes contend for the home
Which perchance they may ne'er see again.
(
Pausing abruptly
.)
Well, we are finely manned
here!
(1st Soldier re-enters.)
2nd Sol
.
How many men do you think we have in all,
upon this hill, Edward?
1st Sol
.
Hist!more than you count on, perhaps.
2nd Sol
.
Why? What is the matter? Why do you
look among those bushes so earnestly?
1st Student
.
It is singular, indeed. I can hardly tell
you what it is, but twice before in my round, precisely
in this same spot, the same impression has flashed upon
me, though the sense that gives it, if sense it is, will not
bide an instant's questioning. There! Hist! Did
nothing move there then?
2nd Sol
.
I see nothing. This comes of star-gazing,
when you should have slept. Though as to that, I have
nothing to complain of, certainly. I had to thank your
taste that way, last night, for an hour of the most
delicious
slumber. It was like that we used to snatch of
old, between the first stroke of the prayer-bell and its
dying
peal.
1st Sol
.
I am glad you could sleep. For myself, such
a world of troubled thoughts haunted me, I found more
repose in waking.
2nd Sol
.
Then I wish you could have shared my
dream with me, as indeed you seemed to, for you were
with me through it all. A blessed dream it was, and
yet
1st Sol
.
Well, let me share it with you now.
2nd Sol
.
I cannot tell you how it was, that in honor
and good conscience we had effected it, but somehow,
methought our part in this sickening warfare was
accomplished
,
and we were home again. Oh the joy of
it! oh the joy of it! Even amid my dream, methought
we questioned its reality, so unearthly in its perfectness,
it seemed. We stood upon the college-green, and the
sun was going down with a strange, darkling splendor;
and from afar, ever and anon came the thunder roll of
battle; but we had nought to do with it; our part was
done; our time was out; we were to fight no more. And
there we stood, watching the student's games; and there
too was poor
Hale
, merry and full of life as e'er he was,
for never a thought of his cruel fate crossed my dream.
Suddenly we saw two ladies, arm in arm, come swiftly
down the shady street, most strangely beautiful and
strangely clad; with long white robes, and garlands in
their hair, and such a clear and silvery laugh, and
something
fearful in their loveliness withal; and one of them,
as she came smiling toward usdo you remember that
bright, fair-haired girl we met in yonder lane one noon?
Just such a smile as hers wore the lady in my dream.
Then, into the old chapel we were crowding all; that
long-deferred commencement had come on at last; we
stood upon a stage, and a strange light filled all the
house, and suddenly the ceiling swelled unto the skiey
dome, and nations filled the galleries; and I woke, to find
myself upon a soldier's couch, and the reveille beating.
1st Sol
.
Well, if it cheered you, `twas a good dream
most certainly, though, yetthe dream-books might not
tell you so. Will you take this glass a moment?
2nd Sol
.
What is it?
1st Sol
.
That white house by the orchard, in the door
do you see nothing?
2nd Sol
.
Yes, a figure, certainly;yes, now it moves.
I had thought those houses were deserted,it is time
they were I think, for all the protection we can give
them. How long shall we maintain this post, think you,
with such a handful?
11*
1st Sol
.
Till the preparations below are complete, I
trust so at least, for we have watchers in these woods, no
doubt, who would speedily report our absence.
2nd Sol
.
Well, if we all see yonder sun go down, 'tis
more than I count on.
1st Sol
.
A chance if we doa chance if we do. Will
the hour come when this infant nation shall forget her
bloody baptism?the holy name of truth and freedom,
that with our hearts' blood we seal upon her in these days
of fear?
2nd Sol
.
Ay, that hour may come.
1st Sol
.
Then, with tears, and
blood
if need be, shall
she learn it anew; and not in vain shall the bones of the
martyrs moulder in her peopled vales. For human
nature
,
in her loftiest mood, was this beautiful land of old
built, and for ages hid. Hereher cradle-dreams
behind
her flung; here, on the height of ages past,
her solemn eye down their long vistas turned, in a
new and nobler life she shall arise here. Ah, who knows
but that the book of History may show us at last on its
long-marred page
Man
himself,no longer the partial
and deformed developments of his nature, which each
successive age hath left as if in mockery of its ideal,
but, man himself, the creature of thought,the high, calm,
majestic being, that of old stood unshrinking beneath
his Maker's gaze. Even, as first he woke amid the
gardens
of the East, in this far western clime at last he shall
smile again,a perfect thing.

In your earnestness, you do not mark these
strange sounds, Edward. Listen.

He grasps his
sword

We are surrounded! Fly. The Indians are
upon us. Fly.
[Rushes on.
(Another Soldier bursts from the woods.)

God! They are butchering them above there,
do not stand here!
[Rushes down the hill.

Resistance is vain. Hear those shrieks!
There is death in them. Resistance is vain.
1st Sol
.
Flight is vain. Look yonder! Francis,
the dark hour hath come!
2nd Sol
.
Is it so? Mother and sister I shall see no
more.
(A number of Indians, disfigured with paint and blood,
and brandishing their knives, come rushing down
the road, uttering short, fierce yells. Others from
below, bringing buck the fugitives.)
1st Sol
.
We shall die together. God of Truth and
Freedom, unto thee our youthful spirits trust we.
(The Indians surround them. Fighting to the last,
they fall.)
DIALOGUE II.
Scene
. The deserted housethe chamberHelen by
the tableher head bowed and motionless. She
rises slowly from her drooping posture.
Helen
.
It is my bridal day. I had forgotten that.
(
Looking from the window
.)
Is this real? Am I here
alone? My mother gone? The army gone? brothers
and sisters gone, and those woods full of armed Indian?
I am awake. This is not the light of dreams,'tis the
sun that's shining there. Not the fresh and tender
morning
sun, that looked in on that parting. Hours he has
climbed since then, to turn those shadows thus,hours that
to me were nothing.Alone?deserteddefenceless?
Of my own will too? There was a
law
in that will,
though, was there not?
(
Turning suddenly from the
window
.)
Shall I see him again? The living real of
my thousand dreams, in the light of life, will he stand
here to-day?to-day? No, no. Is this swift flow of
being leading on to
that?
Oh day of anguish, if in
thine awful bosom, still, that dazzling instant sleeps, I
can forgive the rest.
(She stands by the toilette, and begins to gather once
more the long hair from her shoulders. Suddenly
a low voice at the door breaks the stillness. The
Canadian servant looks in.)
Jan
.
I ask your pardonShall I come in,Ma'amselle?
Helen
.
Ay, ay, come in. How strangely any voice
sounds amid this loneliness. I am glad you are here.
Jan
.
(
Entering.
)
Beautiful! Santa Maria! How
beautiful! May I look at these things, Ma'amselle?
(
Stopping by the couch strewn with bridal gear
.)
Real
Brussels! And the plume in this bonnet, was there ever
such a lovely droop?
Helen
.
Come, fasten this clasp for me, Netty. I thought
to have had another bridesmaid once, butthat is past
Yes, I am a bride to-day, and I must not wait here
unadorned
.
(
Aside
.)
He shall have no hint from me this
day of
altered fortunes
. As though these weary
years had been but last night's dream, and my
wedding-day
had come as it was fixed, so will I meet him.Yet
I thought to have worn my shroud sooner than this
robe.
Jan
.
This silk would stand alone, Ma'amselle,and
what a lovely white it is! Just such a bodice as this
I saw my Lady Mary wear, two years ago this summer,
in Quebec; only, this is a thought deeper. But, Santa
Maria! how it becomes a shape like yours!
Helen
.
What a world of buried feeling lives again as
I feel the clasp of this robe once more! Will he say
these years have changed me?
Jan
.
(
Aside
.)
I do not like that altered mien. How
the beauty flashes from her? Is it silk and lace that can
change one so? Here are bracelets too, Ma'amselle;
will you wear them?
Helen
.
Yes. Go, look from the window, Janette,
down the lane to the woods. I am well-nigh ready now.
He will come,yes, he will come.
(Janette retreats to the window,her eye still
following
the lady.)
Jan
.
I have seen brides before, but never so gay a one
as this. It is strange and fearful to see her stand here
alone, in this lonesome house, all in glistening white,
smiling, and the light flashing from her eyes thus. She
looks too much like some radiant creature from another
world, to be long for this.
Helen
.
He will come, why should he not? Netty, fix
your eye on that opening in the woods, and if you see
but a shadow crossing it, tell me quickly.
Jan
.
I can see nothingnothing at all. Marie
sanctissima
!how
quiet it is! The shadows are straight here
now, Miss Helen.
Helen
.
Noonthe very hour has come! Another
minute it may be.Noon, you said, Netty?
(Joining Janette at the window.)
Jan
.
Yes, quiteyou can see; and hark, there's the
clock. Oh, isn't it lonesome though? See how like the
Sunday those houses look, with the doors all closed and
the yards and gardens still as midnight. If we could but
hear a human voice!whose, I would not care.
Helen
.
How like any other noon-day it comes! The
faint breeze plays in those graceful boughs as it did
yesterday
;
that little, yellow butterfly glides on its noiseless
way above the grass, as then it did;just so, the
shadows
sleep on the grassy road-side there;yes, Netty,
yes,
'tis
very lonely.Hear those merry birds!
Jan
.
But I would rather hear that signal, Miss Helen,
a thousand times, than the best music that ever was
played.
Helen
.
I shall see him again. That wild hope is wild
no longer. To doubt were wilder now. Ay, Fate must
cross my way with a bold hand, to snatch that good from
me now. And yet,alas, in the shadowy future it lieth
still, and a dark and treacherous realm is that! The joys
that blossom on its threshold are not oursIt may be, even
now, darkness and silence everlasting lie between us.
Jan
.
HarkHark!
Helen
.
What is it?
Jan
.
Hark!There!Do you hear nothing?
Helen
.
Distant voices?
Jan
.
Yes
Helen
.
I do
Jan
.
Once before,'twas when I stood in the door
below
,
I heard something like this; but the breeze just then
brought the sound of the fall nearer, and drowned it.
There it is!Nearer. The other window, Miss Helen.
Helen
.
From that hill it comes, does it not?
Jan
.
Yes--yes, I should think it did. Oh yes. There
is a guard left thereI had forgotten that. Mon Dieu!
How white your lips are! Are you afraid, Ma'amselle?
(Helen stands gazing silently from the window.)
Jan
.
There is no danger. It must have been those
soldiers that we heard,or the cry of some wild animal
roaming through yonder woodsit might have been,
how many strange sounds we hear from them. At
another
time we should never have thought of it. I think
we should have heard that signal though, ere this,I do,
indeed.
Helen
.
What is it to die? Nor wood nor meadow, nor
winding stream, nor the blue sky, do
they
see; nor the voice
of bird or insect do they hear; nor breeze, nor sunshine,
nor fragrance visits them. Will there be nothing left that
makes this being then? The high, Godlike purpose
the life whose breath it is,can
that
die?the meek
trust in Goodness Infinite,can
that
perish? No.This
is that building of the soul which nothing can dissolve,
that house eternal, that eternity's wide tempests cannot
move. NonoI a m not afraid. No--Netty, I am not
afraid.
Jan
.
Will you come here, Miss Helen?
Helen
.
Well.
Jan
.
Look among those trees by the road-sidethose
pine trees, on the side of the hill, where my finger
points.
Helen
.
Wellwhat is it?
Jan
.
Do you seewhat a blinding sunshine this is
do you see something moving there?wait a moment
they are hid among the trees nowyou will see them
again presentlyThere!there they come, a troop of them,
see.
Helen
.
Yes
Indians
are they not?
Jan
.
Ayit must have been their yelling that
we heard.We need not be alarmed.They are from
the campthey have come to that spring for water. The
wonder is, your soldiers should have let them pass.
You will see them turning back directly now.
Helen
.
(
Turning from the window
.)
Shelter usall
power is thine.
Jan
.
Holy Virgin!they are coming this way. Those
creatures are coming down that hill, as I live. Yes,
there they come.
This strip of wood hides them now. What keeps
them there so long? Ay, ay,I see nowI am sorry I
should have alarmed you so, Ma'amselle, for nothing too
12
They have struck into those woods again, no doubt;
they are going back to their camp by the lower route.
Helen
.
No.
Jan
.
It must be so. There is no doubt of it. Indeed,
we might be sure they would never dare come here.
They cannot know yet that your army are gone.
Besides
,
we should have heard from them ere this. They
could never have kept their horrid tongues to
themselves
so long, I know.Well, if it were to save me, I
cannot screw myself into this shape any longer.
(
Rising
from the window
.
Helen
.
Listen.
Jan
.
'Tis nothing but the sound of the river. You
can make nothing else of it, Ma'amselle,unless it is
these locusts that you hear. I wish they would cease
their everlasting din a moment.
How that breeze has died away! Every leaf is still
now! There's not a cloud or a speck in all the sky.
Helen
.
Look in the westhave you looked there?
Jan
.
Yes, there are a few little clouds beginning to
gather there indeed. We shall have a shower yet ere
night.
(The war-whoop is heard, loud and near.)
Jan
.
Mon Dieu! Here they are! It is all over with
us! We shall be murdered!
(She clasps her hands, and shrieks wildly.
Helen
.
Hush! hush! Put down that window, and
come away. We must be calm now.
Jan
.
It is all over with us,what use is there? Do
you hear that trampling?in the street!they are
coming!
Helen
.
JanetteHear me. Will you throw away
your life and mine? For shame! Be calm. These
Indians cannot know that we are here. They will see
these houses
all
deserted. Why should they stop to
search
this
? Hush! hush! they are passing now.
Jan
.
They have stopped!the trampling has
stopped
!I
hear the gate,they have come into the yard.
(A long wild yell is heard under the window. They
stand, looking silently at each other. Again it
trembles through the room, louder than before.)
Helen
.
I am sorry you stayed here with me. Perhaps
Hark! What was that? What was that? Was it
not
Maitland
they said then? It wasit isDon't
grasp me so.
Jan
.
Naywhat would you do?
Helen
.
I must speak with them. Let go my arm! Do
you not hear? 'Tis Maitland they are talking of. How
strangely that blessed name sounds in those tones!
Jan
.
You must notwe have tempted Heaven
already
this
is madness.
Helen
.
Let go, Janette. It is not you they seek. You
can conceal yourself. You shall be safe.
Jan
.
She is wild! Nay, I was mad myself, or I should
never have stayed here. It were better to have lived
always with them, than to be murdered thus.
(Helen opens the window, and stands for a moment,
looking silently down into the court. She turns
away, shuddering.)
Helen
.
Can I meet those eyes again?
(Again the name of Maitland mingles with the wild
and unintelligible sounds that rise from without.)
Helen
.
Can I?
(
She turns to the window
.)
What
can it mean? His own beautiful steed! How fiercely
he prances beneath that unskilful rein. Where's your
master, Selma, that he leaves me to be murdered here?
A letter! He bids me unfasten the door, Janette.
Jan
.
And will you?
Helen
.
They are treacherous I know. This will do.
(
Taking a basket from the toilette
.)
Give me that cord.
(
She lets down the basket from the window, and draws
it up, with a letter in it
.)
Helen
.
(
Looking at the superscription
.)
'Tis his!
I thought so. Is it ink and paper that I want now?
(
Breaking it open
.)
Ah, there's no forgery in this. 'Tis
his! 'tis his!
Jan
.
How can she stand to look at that little lock of
hair now?smiling as if she had found a bag of
diamonds
.
But there's bad news there. How the color
fades out, and the light in her eye dies away. What can
it be?
Helen
.
(
Throwing the letter down, and walking the
floor hastily
.)
This is too much! I cannot, I cannot,
I cannot go with them!
How could he ask it of me?
This is
cruel.
He knew, perfectly well, how I have always feared
themI cannot go with them.
(She takes up the letter.)
(
Reading
.)
PossibleIf it were possiblehe
does not read that word as I did when I kept this
promise
Possible?
He does not know the meaning that
love gives that wordIf I had known an hour sooner,
Ay, ay, an hour sooner!Trust me, dear Helen,
they will not harm you.
Trust me,
trust me. Won't
I?
Jan
.
She is beckoning them, as I live!
Helen
.
Bring me that hat and mantle, Netty. I must
go with these savages.
Jan
.
Go
with them!
Helen
.
There is no help for it.
Jan
.
With these wild creatures,with these painted
12*
devils?NoLike nothing human they look, I am
sure. Ah see, see them in their feathers and blankets,
and that long wild hair. See the knives and the
tomahawks
in their girdles! Holy Mary! Here's one
within
the court!
Helen
.
Yes, there he standsthere's life in it now.
There they standthe chesnut boughs wave over them
this is the filling up of life. They
are
waiting for me.
'Tis no dream.
Jan
.
Dare you go with them? They will murder
you.
Helen
.
If they were but human, I could move them
and yet it is the human in them that is so dreadful. To
die were sad enoughto die by violence, by the power
of the innocent elements, were dreadful, or to be torn of
beasts; to meet the wild, fierce eye, with its fixed and
deadly purpose, more dreadful; but ah, to see the human
soul, from the murderers eye glaring on you, to
encounter
the human will in its wickedness, amid that wild
struggleOh God! spare me.
Jan
.
If you fear them so, surely you will not go with
them.
Helen
.
This letter says they are kind and innocent.
One I
should
believe tells me there is no cause for fear.
In his haste he could not find no other way to send for
me.The army will be here soon,I
must
go with
them.
Jan
.
But Captain Grey will come back here again
this afternoon. Stay,stay, and we will go with him.
Helen
.
You canyes, you will be safe. For myself, I
will abide my choice. Surely I need not dread to go
where my betrothed husband trusts me so fearlessly. I
count my life worth little more than the price at which he
values it. Clasp this mantle, Netty.And is it thus I go
forth from these blessed walls at last?Through all those
safe and quiet hours of peace and trust, did this dark end
to them lie waiting here?Are they calling me?
Jan
.
Yes.
Helen
.
Well,I am ready.
(
Lingering in the door
.)
I
shall sit by that window no more. Never again shall I
turn those blinds to catch the breeze or the sunshine.
Yes
(
returning
)
, let me look down on that orchard
once again. Never morenever more.
(She walks to the door, again pausing on the
threshold
.
Helen
.
(
solemnly
.)
Oh God, here, from childhood to
this hour, morning and evening I have called on thee
forget me not. Farewell, Netty, you will see my mother
you will see them allthat is past.Tell her I had
seen the Indians, and was not afraid.
[She goes out.
Jan
.
It won't take much to make an angel of her,
there's that in it.
(Looking cautiously through the shutters.)
There she comes! How every eye in that wild group
flashes on her! And yet with what a calm and stately
bearing she meets them. Holy Mary! she suffers that
savage creature to lift her to her horse, as though he
were her brother, and the long knife by his side too,
glancing
in the sunshine! The horse, one would think, he
knew the touch of that white hand on his neck. How
gently he rears his beautiful head. There they go.
Adieu! Was there ever so sad a smile?
Another glimpse I shall have of them yet beyond those
trees.Yes, there they gothere they go. I can see
that lovely plume waving among the trees still.Was
there ever so wild a bridal train?
DIALOGUE III.
Scene

furnished. An Officer seated at a table covered
with papers and maps. A Servant in waiting.

(
Sipping his wine, and carefully
examining
a plan of the adjacent country
.)
About here,

st Off
.
How goes it abroad, Colonel St. Leger?
2
nd Off
.
Indeed, Sir, the camp is as quiet as midnight.
It's a breathless heat. But there are a few dark heads
swelling in the west. We may have a shower yet ere
night.
Bur
.
Good news that. But here is better,
(
giving
the other an open letter
.)
St. Leger
.
Ay, ay, that reads well, Sir.
Bur
.
And here is another as good. Yes Sir, yes Sir,
they are flocking in from all quartersthe insurgents are
laying down their arms by hundreds. It must be a
miserable fragment that Schuyler has with him by this.
St. L
.
General Burgoyne, is not it a singular
circumstance
,
that the enemy should allow us to take possession
of a point like that without opposition,so trifling a
detachment, too? Why, that hill commands the fort,
certainly it does.
Bur
.
Wellwell. They are pretty much reduced,
I fancy, Sir. We shall hardly hear much more from
them. Let me see,this is the hill.
St. L
.
A pity we could not provoke them into an
engagement, though! They depend so entirely upon
the popular feeling for supplies and troops, and the whole
machinery of their warfare, that it is rather
hazardous
reckoning upon them, after all. If we could draw
them into an engagement
now,
the result would be
certain
.
Bur
.
Yes, yes; we must contrive to do that ere
long. Rather troublesome travelling companions they
make, that's certain. Like those insects that swarm
about us here,no great honor in fighting them, but a
good deal of discomfort in letting them alone. We must
sweep them out of our way, I think, or at all events give
them a brush, that will quiet them a little.
St. L
.
Or they might prove, after all, like the
gadfly
in the fable. I do not think this outbreak will be
any disadvantage in the end, General.
Bur
.
Not a whitnot a whitthey have needed this,
It will do them good, Sir.
St. L
.
The fact is, these colonies were founded in
the spirit of insubordination, and all the circumstances
of their position have hitherto tended to develope only
these disorganizing elements.
Bur
.
It will do them good, Sir. Depend upon it,
they'll remember this lesson. Pretty well sickened of
war are they all. They'll count the cost ere they try it
again.
St. L
.
We can hardly expect the news from General
Reidesel before sunset, I suppose.
Bur
.
If my messenger returns by to-morrow's sunrise,
it is better fortune than I look for.
(Col. St. Leger goes out.)
(Burgoyne resumes his plan.)
A Ser't
.
(
At the door
.)
Capt. Maitland, Sir.
Bur
.
Capt. Maitland!
Ser't
.
From Fort Ann, Sir.
(Maitland enters.)
Bur
.
Captain Maitland! Good heavens, I thought
you were at Skeensborough by this,what has happened?
or am I to congratulate myself that the necessity of your
embassy is obviated. You met them, perhaps?
Maitland
.
There's but little cause of congratulation,
Sir, as these dispatches will prove to you. I returned
only because my embassy was accomplished.
Bur
.
Do you mean to say, Captain Maitland, that you
have seen the waters of Lake Champlain, since you left
here this morning?
Mait
.
I do, Sir.
Bur
.
On my word, these roads must have improved
since we travelled them some two days agone. I am
sorry for your horses, Sir. You saw General Reidesel?
Mait
.
I left him only at nine o'clock this morning.
(Burgoyne examines the dispatches.)
Bur
.
Twelve oxen to one batteaux!and but fifty
teams! This news was scarcely worth so much haste,
I think,but fifty teams?Captain Maitland, had those
draught horses from Canada not arrived yet?
Mait
.
They were just landing this morning as I left,
but only one-fourth of the number contracted for.
Bur
.
Humph! I would like to know what time, at
this ratesit down, Captain Maitland, sit downwe
are like to spend the summer here, for aught I see,
after all.
(
A long pause, in which Burgoyne resumes
his reading
.)
Mait
.
General Burgoyne, I am entrusted with a
message
from General Reidsel to the Baroness. If this is
all
Bur
.
What were you saying?The Baronessay,
aythat's all well enough,but Captain Maitland is
aware, no doubt, there are more important subjects on
the tapis just now than a lady's behests.
Mait
.
Sir?
Bur
.
(
Pushing the papers impatiently from him
.)
This will never do. St. George! We'll give these
rebels other work ere many days, than driving away cattle
and breaking down bridges for our convenience.
Meanwhile
we must open some new source of supplies, or
we may starve to death among these hills yet. Captain
Maitland, I have a proposal to make to you. You are
impatient, Sir.
13
Mait
.
General Burgoyne!
Bur
.
Nay, nay,there's no haste about it. It were
cruel to detain you now, after the toil of this wild
journey
.
You'll find your quarters changed, Captain
Maitland
.
We sent a small detachment across the river just
now. Some of our copper-colored allies had got into a
fray with the enemy there.
Mait
.
Ha!
(
returning
.)
Bur
.
Nothing of consequence, as it turns out. We
hoped it would have ended in something. A few of the
enemy, who were stationed as a guard on a hill not far
from Fort Edward, were surprised by a party of Indians,
and killed, to a man, I believe. Afterwards, the victors
got into a deadly fray among themselves as usual. A
quarrel between a couple of these chiefs, at some famous
watering place of theirs, and in the midst of it, a party
from the fort drove them from the ground;this is
Alaska's own story at least.
Mait
.
Alaska's!
Bur
.
Alaska?Alaska?yes, I think it was,one of
these new allies we have picked up here.
Mait
.
(
In a whisper
.)
Good God!
Bur
.
By the time our detachment arrived there,
however
,
the ground was cleared, and they took quiet
possession
.
Are you ill, Captain Maitland?
Mait
.
A little,it is nothing. I am to cross the
river.
Bur
.
Yes. You will take these papers to Captain
Andre. You have over-fatigued yourself. You should
have taken more time for this wild journey.
(Maitland goes out.)
Bur
.
I do not like the idea of division, but it cannot be
helped now. This gallant young soldier were a fitting
leader for such an enterprize.
DIALOGUE IV.
Scene
. The ground before Maitland's Tent.
(Maitland and the Indian Chief, Manida, enter.)
Mait
.
This is well.
(
He writes on a slip of paper,
and gives it to the Indian
.)
Take that, they will give
you the reward you ask for it. Let me see your face no
more, that is all.
Manida
.
Ha,
Monsieur?
Mait
.
Let me see your face no more, I say. Do you
understand me?
Manida
.
(
Smiling
.)
Oui.
(Maitland turns from him. The Indian goes off in
the opposite direction. He stops a moment, and steals
a look at Maitland,throws his head back with a
long silent laugh, and then goes on toward the
woods.)
Mait
.
(
Musing
.)
I like this.
This
is womanly!
Nay, perhaps there is no capriee about it. I may have
misinterpreted that letter in my haste last night. Very
likely. Well,better this, than that Helen Grey should
come to evil through fault of mine,better this, than the
anguish of the horrible misgivings that haunted me amid
my journey.
And so pass these faery visions! Nay, not thus. It
will take longer than this to unlink this one day's hope
from its thousand fastnesses. I thought, ere this, to have
met the spirit of those beaming eyes, to have taken to my
heart for ever this soft, pure being of another life.
And yet, even as I rode through those lonely hills this
morning, with every picture my hope painted, there came
a strange misgiving;like some scene of laughing
noon-day
loveliness, darkening in the shadow of a summer's
cloud.
Strange that Alaska should abandon my trust! I
cannot
understand it. Why, I should never have trusted
her with this rascal Indian. There was something in
his eye, hateful beyond all thought,and once or twice
I caught a strange expression in it, like malignant
triumph
it seemed. It may beno, he must have seen
herthat glove he showed me was hers, I know. Good
God!what ifI think my old experience should
have taught me there was little danger of her risking
much in my behalf. Welleven this is better, than that
Helen Grey should have come to evil through fault of
mine.

PART SIXTH.
RECONCILIATION.
DIALOGUE I.
Scene
. The slope of the Hill near Fort Edward.
The road-side, shaded with stately pines and
hemlocks
.
(Two British Officers, coming slowly down the road.)
1
st Off
.
Yes, here has been wild work upon this hill
to-day. They were slaughtered to a man.
2nd Off
.
I saw a sight above there, just now, that
sickened me of warfare.
1
st Off
.
And what was that, pry'thee?
2
nd Off
.
Oh nothing,'twas nothing but a dead
soldier
;
a common sight enough, indeed; but this was a
mere youth;he was lying in a little hollow on the
road-side
,
and as I crossed in haste, I had well-nigh set my
foot on his brow. Such a brow it was, so young, so
noble
,
and the dark chesnut curls clustering about it. I think
I never saw a more classic set of features, or a look of
loftier courage than that which death seemed to have
found and marbled in them. Harkthat's a water-fall
we hear.
1
st Off
.
I saw him, there was another though, lying
not far thence, the sight of whom moved me more. He
was younger yet, or seemed so, and of a softer mould;
and, torn and bloody as they were, I fancied I could see
in his garb and appointments, and in every line of his
features, the traces of some mother's tenderness.
2
nd Off
.
Listen, Andre! This is beautiful! There's
some cascade not far hence, worth searching for.
Andre
.
Yes, just in among those trees you'll find a
perfect drawing-room, carpeted, canopied, and dark as
twilight; its verdant seats broidered with violets and
forget-me-nots; and all untenanted it seems, nay,
deserted
rather, for the music wastes on the lonely air, as if the
fairy that kept state there, in gossip mood had stolen
down some neighboring aisle, and would be home anon.
I would have bartered all the glory of this campaign for
leave to stretch myself on its mossy bank, for a soft hour
or so.
Mor
.
Ay, with Chaucer or the Faery Queen. If
one could people these lovely shades with the fresh
creations
of the olden time, knight and lady, and dark
enchantress
and Paynim fierce, instead of Yankee rebels
Andre
.
'Twere well your faery-work were of no
lasting
mould, or these same Yankee rebels would scarce
thank you for your pains,they hold that race in little
reverence. Alas,
No grot divine, or wood-nymph haunted glen,
Or stream, or fount, shall these young shades e'er know.
No beautiful divinity, stealing afar
Through darkling nooks, to poet's eye thence gleam;
With mocking my stery the dim ways wind,
They reach not to the blessed fairy-land
That once all lovely in heaven's stolen light,
To yearning thoughts, in the deep green-wood grew.
Ah! had they come to light when nature
Was a wonder-loving, story-telling child!
The misty morn of ages had gone by,
The dreamy childhood of the race was past,
And in its tame and reasoning manhood,
In the daylight broad, and noon-day of all time,
This
world hath sprung. The poetry of
truth,
None other, shall her shining lakes, and woods,
And ocean-streams, and hoary mountains wear.
Perchance that other day of poesy,
Unsung of prophets, that upon the lands
Shall dawn yet, thence shall spring. The self-same
mind
That on the night of ages once, for us
Those deathless clusters flung, the self-same mind,
With all its ancient elements of might,
Among us now its ancient glory hides;
But, from its smothered power, and buried wealth,
A golden future sparkles, decked from deeper founts,
A new and lovelier firmament,
A thousand realms of song undreamed of now,
That shall make Romance a forgotten world,
And the young heaven of Antiquity,
With all its starry groups, a gathered scroll.
Mor
.
Ay, Andre, you were born a poet, and have
mistaken
your art. Prythee excuse me, who am but a poor
soldier, for marring so fine a rhapsody with any thing so
sublunary; but, methinks, for an enemy's quarters,
youder
fort shows as peaceable a front of stone and mortar
as one could ask for. What can it mean that they are
so quiet there?
Andre
.
That spy did not return a second time.
Mor
.
The rogues have made sure of him ere this, I
fancy. They may have given us the slip,who knows?
Andre
.
I would like to venture a stroll through that
shady street if I thought so. A dim impression that I
have somewhere seen this view before, haunts me
unaccountably
.
Mor
.
How I hate that sober, afternoon air, that hangs
like an invisible presence over it all. You can see it in
the sunshine on those white walls, you can hear it in the
hum of the bee from the bending thistle here.
Andre
.
Of the mind it is. This were lovely as the
morning light, but for the shade it gathers thence, from
the thought of decline and the vanishing day. 'Tis a
pretty spot.
Mor
.
Yes, but the quiet goings-on of life are all
hushed
there now.
Andre
.
Ay, this is the hour, when the home-bound
children swing the gate with a merry spring, and the
mother sits at her work by the open window, with her quiet
eye, and the daughter, with the beauty of an untamed soul
in her's, looks forth on the woods and meadows, and
thinks of her walk at even-tide. I thought it was
something
like a memory that haunted me thus,'tis the spot
that Maitland talked of yesterday.
Mor
.
Captain Maitland? I saw him just now at the
works above.
Andre
.
Here? On this hill?
Mor
.
Yes,something struck me in his mien,and
there he stands with Colonel Hill, above, on the other
side.Mark him now. Your friend is handsome,
Andre
;
he is handsome, I'll own,but I never liked that
smile of his, and I think I like it less than ever now.
Andre
.
Why, that's the genuine Apollo-curl,a line's
breadth deeper were too much, I'll own.
(Maitland and another Officer enter.)
Off
.
That is all,that is all, I believe, Captain
Maitland
.
Yonder pretty dwelling among the trees seems
an old acquaintance of yours. It has had the ill manners
to rob me of your eye ever since we stood here, and I
have had little token that the other senses were not in
its company. Andre, has your friend never a ladye-love
in these wilds, you could tell us of?
Mor
.
He is sworn to secresy. Did you mark that
glance?
Mait
.
Love! I hold it a pretty theme for the
ballad-makers
,
Colonel Hill; but for myself, I have scarce time
for rhyming just now. Captain Andre, here are papers for
you.
[He walks away, descending the road.
Col. Hill
.
So! So! What ails the boy?
(Looking after him for a moment, and then ascending
the hill.)
Andre
.
(
Reading
.)
Humph! Here's prose enough!
Will you walk up the hill with me, Mortimer? I must
cross the river again.
Mort
.
First let me seek this horse of mine,the rogue
must have strayed down this path, I think.
(He enters the wood
.)
(Andre walks to and fro with an impatient air, then
pauses.)
Andre
.
Well, I can wait no longer for this loiterer.
[Exit.
(Mortimer re-enters, calling from the woods.)
Mor
.
Andre! Maitland! Colonel Hill! Good
Heavens! Where the devil are they all? Maitland!
(Maitland appears, slowly ascending the road.)
Mor
.
For the love of Heaven,come here.
Mait
.
Nay,but what is it?
Mor
.
For God's sake, come.
DIALOGUE II.
Scene.
A little glen, darkly shaded with pines. A
fountain issuing from one side, and falling with a
curious murmur into the basin below.
Mortimer and Maitland enter
.
Mor
.
This is the place!Well, if hallucinations like
this can visit mortal eyes, I'll ne'er trust mine again.
'Tis the spot, I'm sure of it,the place, too, that Andre
was raving about just now.The fairies' drawing-room,
palace rather,look at these graceful shafts,
Maitland
,and
fairies' work, it must have been in good
earnest.
Mait
.
If it's to admire this clump of pine trees you
have brought me hither, allow me to say you might have
spared yourself that trouble. I have seen the place
already
,
as often as I care to.
Mor
.
Come this way a little,yes, it was just above
there that I stood,it must have been.
Mait
.
If you would give me some little inkling of what
you are talking about, Lieutenant Mortimer, I should be
more likely to help you, if it's help you need.
Mor
.
I do not ask you to believe me, but,as I was
springing on my horse just now above there, the gurgling
of this spring caught my ear, and looking down
suddenly
upon
my word, Captain Maitland, I am ashamed
to describe what cannot but seem to you such an
improbable
piece of fancy-work; and yet, true it seemed, as
that I see you now. I was looking down, as I said, when
suddenly, among those low evergreens, the brilliant hue
of a silken mantle caught my eye, and then a woman's
brow gleamed up upon me. Yes, there in that dark
cradle, calmly sleeping, all flashing with gold and jewels,
like some bright vision of olden time, methought there
laya lady,a girl, young and lovely as a dream;the
white plume in her bonnet soiled and broken, and the
14
long bright hair streaming heavily on her mantle,and
yet with all its loveliness, such a face of utter sorrow saw
I never. I
saw
her, I saw her, as I see you now,the
proud young form with such a depth of grace, in its
strange repose, andwhere are you going?what are
you doing, Maitland?
Mait
.
Helen Grey!
Mor
.
You are right. I did not mark that breakyes
there she lies. Said I right, Maitland?
Mait
.
Helen Grey!
Mor
.
Maitland! Heavens!what a world of anguish
that tone reveals!Why do you stand gazing on that
lovely
sleeper thus?
Mait
.
Bring water. There's a cup at yonder spring.
Here has been treachery! Devils and fiends have been
working here against me. We must unclasp this
mantle
.
The treasure of the earth lies here.Now doth
mine arm enfold it once, at last. 'Tis sweet, Helen,
mine own
true
love; 'tis sweet, even thus.
Mor
.
This letter,seefrom those loosened folds it
just now dropped. This might throw some light,
perchance
Mait
.
Let it be. There's light enough. I want no
more. Water,more water,do you see?
Mor
.
Maitland,this is vain. Mark this dark spot
upon her girdle
Mait
.
Hush, hush,there, cover it thus'tis nothing.
Loosen this bonnetso'twas a firm hand that tied
that knot; soshe can breathe now.
Mor
.
How like life, those soft curls burst from their
loosened pressure! But mark youthere is no other
motion
.
I am sorry to distress you,butMaitlandthis
lady is dead.
Mait
.
Dead!
Lying hell-hound!
Dead!
Say that
again.
Mor
.
God help you!
Mait
.
Dead!
Helen Grey, open these eyes. Here's
one that, never having seen them, talks of death. Oh
God! is it thus we meet at last? At last these arms
are round her, and she knows it not. I look upon her,
but her eye answers me not. Dead!for me?
Murdered
!mine
own hand hath done it.
Mor
.
Why do you start thus?
Mait
.
Hush!hush! There!againthat slow
heavy throbagain! again!
Mor
.
Good God! she breathes! This is life indeed.
Mait
.
(
Solemnly
.)
Ay, thank God. This moment's
sweetness is enough.
Mor
.
How like one in troubled sleep she murmurs!
Mark those tones of sweet and wild entreaty. Listen!
Mait
.
I have heard it again!from the buried years
of love and hope that music came. She is here. 'Tis
she
. This is no marble mockery. She is here! Her
head is on my bosom. Death cannot rob me of this
sweetness now.
(Talking without.)
A Lady
.
This wayI hear their voices. Down this
pathwayhere they are.
(Lady Ackland and Andre enter the Glen.)
Lady A
.
I knew it could not be. They told us she
was murdered, Maitland.
(
Starting back
.)
Ahah
God help thee, Maitland!
Mait
.
Listen, listen. She was speaking but now.
Thereagain!
Lady A
.
And this is she! Can the wilderness
blossom
thus? And did God unfold such lovelinessfor a
waste so cruel?
Helen
.
(
In a low murmur
.)
We are almost there.
If we could but pass this glen. Oh God! will they stop
here? Go on,go on. Was not that a white tent I
saw? Go on. They will not. 'Tis nothing,do not
weep.
Mait
.
Look at me, Helen.Open these eyes. One
more lookone more.
Andre
.
She hears your bidding.
Mait
.
Oh God! Do you see those eyesthose dim,
bewildered eyes?it is quenchedquenched. Let her
lean on you.
Lady A
.
Gentlygently, she does not see us yet.
Helen
.
Oh Mother, I am ill and weary. Here's this
dream again! Blue sky? and pine-tree boughs? Am I
here indeed? Yes, I remember now,we stood upon
that cliffI am dying. Is there no one here? Whose
tears are these?
Lady A
.
Dear child, sweet one, nay, lean on me.
Helen
.
My mother, oh my mother, come to me. Come,
Annie, come, come! Strangers all!
Mor
.
Her eye is on him. Hush!
Andre
.
See in an instant how the light comes flashing
up from those dim depths again.
That
is the eye that I
saw yesterday.
Lady A
.
That slowly settling smile,deeper and
deepersaw you ever any thing so gay, so passing
lovely
?
Helen
.
Is itis itEverard Maitlandis it
thee?
The living real of my thousand dreams, in the light of
life doth he stand there now? Doth he?
'Tis he!
Mait
.
Helen!
Helen
.
'Tis he! That tone's spell builds around me
its all-sheltering music-walls, and death is nothing. Oh
God, when at thy dark will dimly revealed, I trembled
14*
yesterday, I did not think in this most rosy bower to
meet its fearfulness.
Mait
.
Helen,dost thou love me
yet?
Helen
.
Doubter, am I dying here?
Mait
.
'Tis her own most rich and blessed smile,
even as of old in mirth it shone upon me. Your
murderer
,
you count me then?
Helen
.
Come hither,let me lean on
you
. Star of
the wilderness!of this life that is fading now, the sun!
doth
mine eye see thee, then, at last? Oh! this is
sweet! On its own holy home my head rests now.
Everard, in this dark world
Love leans on Faith
. How
else, even in God's love and loveliness, could I trust now
for that strange future on whose bloody threshold I am
lying
here; yes, and in spite of prayers and trust, and
struggling
hopes. And yethow beautiful it isthat love
invisible
,
invisible no more. Like glorious sunshine it is
streaming round me,lighting all. The infinite of that
thy smile hath imaged, as real,it beams on me now.
Have faith, in
him
I mean; forif we meet againwe'll
need it then no more; andhow dim it growsnay, let
me lean on you,andthrough
this
life's darkening
glass I shall see you no more. Nay, hold me!quick!
where art thou?Everard!He is gonegone!
Lady A
.
Dead!
Mor
.
She is dead!
Andre
.
This was Love.
Lady A
.
See how her eyes are fixed on
you
. The
light and love of the vanished soul looks through them
still. Cruelly hath it been sent thence; and no other
gleam of its changeful beauty will e'er dawn in them.
Sadly, oh lovely stranger, I close for ever now these
dark-fringed lids upon their love and beauty. Yes
this
was love!
Andre
.
And so there was a need-be in its doom. I'll
ne'er believe
that
genuine, that is blessed. The fate of
this life would not suffer it. Ah! if it would, if Heaven
should leave a gem like that outside her walls, we should
none of us go thither.
Mait
.
Dead? How beautiful! Yeslet her lie
thereunder that lovely canopy. Dead!it's a curious
wordHow comes it that we all stand here? Ha,
Ander?is it you?
Andre
.
I heard the tale as I crossed just now, from
an Indian, who was one in the ambuscade this noon
and in the woods on the other side, I found this lady,
with her attendants, abiding the promise she made you
last night, to welcome this lovely stranger with her
savage
guides.
Mait
.
Hush, hush. Let it pass. See,a bride!
Mor
.
(
Aside
.)
Did he trust her with these
murderers
?
Mait
.
Aysay yes.
Andre
.
Indeed, Maitland, you wrong yourself. It was
the treachery of this savage Manida that crossed your
plans, working the mission of some Higher power,as for
Alaska, you might as soon have doubted me.
The Chief he sent for her was one he had known
yearsbut, unfortunately, he was one in the ambuscade
this morningnay, the leader of it; for the murdered
Indian
was his son; and meanwhile amid the fight the
treacherous Manida, who accompanied him to
Maitland's
tent last night, and heard the promised reward,
found means to steal from its concealment the letter,
with which he easily won this trusting lady to
accompany
him.
Mor
.
Ah!there it lies.
Andre
.
It was here in this glen that Alaska,
discovering
the treachery, lay in wait for them with a band of
chosen warriors, and on that cliff above they fought.
Lady A
.
(
Aside
.)
and she stood there, amid those
yelling demons alone! Methinks the angels should have
come from their unseen dwellings at her prayer. Can
our humanity's darkest extremity wring no love from the
invisible?
Andre
.
Alaska had regained his charge; but the
malignant
eye, and the deadly arrow of the vanquished
Indian
followed her. She fell, even in the place where you
found her; for at that same instant a party from the fort
drove them hence, victor and vanquished. Alaska fled;
but the murderer, with a tale cunning enough to deceive
the lover, boldly demanded and obtained the prize.
Mor
.
Mark his changed mien. I would rather see
tears for a grief like this, than that calm smile with
which he gazes on her now.
(Burgoyne and St. Leger are seen talking in the road
above,they enter the glen.)
Bur
.
At a crisis like this we might better have lost a
thousand men in battle! Ah! ah!a sight for our
enemies
,
Lady Ackland! Where is this Indian?
St. L
.
We have sent out for him. No one has seen
him as yet.
Bur
.
Let him be found. Look to it. We will give
them an example for once. I say, at a crisis like this
we might better have lost a thousand men in battle,
for it will turn thousands against us, and rouse the
slumbering spirit of resistance here, at the very crisis
when, had it slumbered on a little longer, all was ours.
St. L
.
But this was a quarrel among the Indians, and
no fault of ours.
Bur,
.
No matter. You will see what Schuyler will
make of it. His wordy proclamation will have its living
sequel now. A young and innocent girl, seeking the
protection of our camp, is inhumanly murdered by
Indians
in our pay. A single tale like this is enough to
undo at a blow all that we have accomplished here.
With ten thousand will aggravations, it will be told in
every cottage of these borders before to-morrow's
sunset
.
(Another Officer enters hastily.)
Off
.
Here is Arnold, with a thousand men, on the
brow of the next hill. One of the rebel guard escaped,
and the news of the massacre here has reached their
camp below.
Bur
.
Said I right?
(The three Officers go out together.)
Andre
.
This story is spreading fast, there will be
throngs here presently. Maitland,nay, do not let me
startle you thus, but
Mait
.
Is it you? What was it we were saying
yesterday
?we
should have noted it. This were a picture
worth your pencilling now. Those silken vestments,
that long, golden hait,this youthful shape,there's that
same haughty grace about it, that the smile of these
thought-lit eyes would disown with every glance. Then
that letter,and the Lady Ackland here,Weeping?
This is most strange. I know you all,but,as I live I
can't remember how this chanced. How comes it that we
all stand here? Pearls?and white silk?a bridal?
Ha ha ha!
(
Laughing wildly
.)
Lady A
.
Take me away. This is too terrible! I can
stay here no longer. Take me away, Andre.
[Exeunt Andre and Lady A.
(An Officer enters.)
The Officer
.
We are ordered to withdraw our
detachment
,
Captain Maitland. The rebels are just below,
some two thousand strong, and in no mood to be
encountered
.
Mor
.
He does not hear you. We must leave that
murdered lady here, and 'its vain to think of parting
them. Come.
[Exeunt Mortimer and Officer.
Mait
.
They are gone at last. They are all gone. I
am alone with my dead bride. I must needs smileI
could not weep when those haughty and prying eyes
were upon me, but nowI am alone with my dead bride.
Helen, they are all gone,we are alone. How still she
lies,smiling too,on that same bank. She will speak,
surely she will. How lightly those soft lashes lie, as if a
word would lift them.Helen!I will be calm and
patient
as a child. This lovely smile is deepening, it will
melt to words again.Hark! that spring,that same
curious murmur! We have checked our sweetest
words to hear it, we have stood here listening to it, till
we fancied, in its talk-like tones, wild histories, beautiful
and sad, the secrets of the woods.Oh God!and have
such memories no power here now? In mine ear alone
doth the spring murmur now. Death! what is't?
Awake! awake,by the love that is
stronger
than
death,awake!
I thought that scene would shift. It had a heavy,
dream-like mistiness.
This
is reality again.
These
are the pine trees that I dreamed of. See! how
beautiful
!
With the sharp outline and the vivid hue such as
our childhood's unworn sense yields, they are waving
now. Look, Andre, there she sits, the young and radiant
stranger,there, in the golden sunset she is sitting still,
braiding those flowers,see, how the rich life flashes in
her eye, and yet, just now I dreamed that she was dead,
andandOh my God!
(A voice without.)
Let go, who stays me?where's my sister?
(Captain Grey enters.)
Grey
.
Ha! Murderer! art satisfied?
Mait
.
Ay.
Grey
.
What, do you mock me, Sir?
Mait
.
Let her be. She is mine!all mine! my
love, my bride,my
bride?  Murderer?
Stay!
Don't glare at me! I know you, Sir. I can hurl off
these mountain shadows yet.They'll send some
stronger
devil ere they wrench this hold from me! I know
you well. What make you here?
Grey
.
Madness!there's little wonder!It's the only
good that Heaven has left for him! My lovely
playfellow
,my
sister, is it so indeed? Alas! all gently
lies this hand in mine. There is no angry strength here
now. Helen!--Ah! would to God our last words had
not been in bitterness.
Mait
.
He weeps. I never thought to see tears there.
List!she should not lie there thus. Strange it should
move you so!--Think it a picture now. 'Tis but a
well-wrought
painting after all, if one but thinks so. See,
'tis but a sleeping girl, with the red summer light upon
her cheek, and the slight breeze stirring her golden hair.
Mark you that shoulder's grace?They come.
(Leslie, Elliston, and others enter.)
Leslie
.
Oh God, was there none other? My lovely
cousin, andwere
you
the victim? In your bridal glory
chosen,nay, with your heart's holiest law lured to the
bloody altar! Yet this day's history, and something in
that calm, high mien, tells me, as freely you had moved
unto it, though God had spoken by a higher voice, and
with a martyr's garland beckoned you.
Elliston
.
Our cause is linked unto that ancient one,
the cause of Love and Truth; in which Heaven moves
with unrelenting hand, not sparing its own loveliest
ones, but unto bloody death freely delivering them.
(Grey and Leslie converse apart.)
Leslie
.
Yeswe will bury her here. 'Tis a fitting
spot; and unto distant days, this lonely grave, with its
ever-verdant canopy, shall be even as Love's Shrine.
Thither, in the calm and smiling summers of those
bloodless
times shall many a fair young pilgrim come, to
wonder at such love; and living eyes shall weep, and
living hearts shall heave over its cruel fate, when unto
her the long-told tale, and all the anguish of this far-off
day, shall be even as the dim passage of some troubled
dream. A martyr's garland she hath won indeed; true
Love's young Martyr there she lies.
Elliston
.
Yet was that love but the wreathed and
glittering
weapon of a higher doom. In that holy cause,
whose martyrs strew a thousand fields, truth's, freedom's,
God's, darkly, by
Power Invisible
hath this young life
been offered here.
A thousand graves like this, over all this lovely land,
in lanes and fields, on the lonely hill-side, by the
laughing
stream, and in the depths of many a silent wood, to
distant days shall speakof blood-sealed destinies;
with voices that no tyrant's power can smother, they
shall speak.
Leslie
.
The light of that chamber window, through
the soft summer evening will shine here; no mournful
memory of all the lovely past will it waken. The
autumn
blaze will flicker within those distant walls, and
gather its pleasant circle again; but
she
will lie calmly
here. For ever at her feet the river of her childhood
shall murmur on, and many a lovely spring-time, like the
spring-times of her childhood, shall come and go, but no
yearning hope shall it waken here; the winter shall sing
through the desolate boughs, and rear its fairy temples
around her, but nought shall break her dreamless rest.
Mait
.
Graves! Is it graves they are talking of?
Will they bury this gay young bride! 'Tis but the
name; there's nothing sad in it. In the lovely summer
twilight shall her burial be, and thus; in all her bridal
array, with the glory of the crimson sunset shining
through the trees;see what a fearful glow is kindling
on her cheek, and that faint breezeor, is it life that stirs
these curls? Stay!whose young brow is this?Ha!
whose
smile is this? Who is this they would hurry
away into the darkness of death? The grave! Could
you fold the rosy and all-speading beauty of heaven in
the narrow grave? Helen, is it thee?my heaven, my
long-lost heaven; and, even now, but for mine own deed
Oh God! was there no hand but mine?but for me
They shall not utter it,there, thus. There's
but
one
cry that could unfold this grief, but that would
circle the round universe and fill eternity. A sad sight
this! Is't known who killed this lady, Sir?
Leslie
.
Of all the wrecks of beautiful humanity that
strew these paths, we have found none so sad as this!
Elliston
.
Mark you those groups of soldiers loitering
on the road-side there?
An Officer
.
Curiosity. The regiment that was
dismissed
to-day. They'll be here anon.
Leslie
.
Ay, let them come.
Off
.
Look,who comes up that winding pathway
through the trees, with such a swift and stately
movement
?
A woman! See how the rude soldiers turn
aside with awe. Ah, she comes hither.
(A voice without.)
Where is she?stand aside!What have you here
in this dark ring?Henrynay, let me come.
(Mrs. Grey enters the glen.)
Grey
.
For God's sake, Madam, let me lead you hence.
This is no place for you. Look at this group of men,
officers, soldiers
Mrs. G
.
Would you cheat me
thus
? Is it no place
for
me
? What kind of place is't then for her, whose
Oh God!think you I do not see that slippered foot, nor
know whose it is,and whose plumed bonnet is it that
lies crushed there at their feet?unhand me, Henry.
Leslie
.
Nay, let her come,'tis best.
(She passes swiftly through the parting group.)
Mrs. G
.
My daughter!
Blood?
My stricken child
smile you? No pity was there then? Speak to me, speak!
Your mother's tears are on your brow, and heed you not?
Nay, tell me all, my smitten one. This day's dark
history
will you never pour into my ear, that bath treasured so
often your lightest grief? Alone through that wild
anguish
have you passed, and smile you now? I bade her
trust in God. Did
God
see this?
(Arnold, and a group of Soldiers, enter the glen.)
Arnold
.
Look there. Ay, ay, look there. You were
right, Leslie;this
is
better than a battle-field. They'll
find that this day's work will cost them dear.
Mrs. G.
Did
God,
who loves as mothers love their
babes, see this? Had I been there, with my love, in the
heavens, could
I
have given up this innocent and tender
child a prey to the wild Indians? No!and legions of
pitying angels waiting but my word. No,no.
Elliston
.
Had you been
there,
from that far centre
whence God's eye sees all, you had beheld what lies in
darkness here. Forth from this fearful hour you might
have seen Peace, like a river, flowing o'er the years to
come; and smiles, ten thousand, thousand smiles, down
the long ages brightening, sown in this day's tears. Had
you been there with God's
all-
pitying eye, the pitying
legions had waited your word in vain, for once, unto a
sterner doom, for the world's sake he gave his Son.
Mrs. G.
Words! Look there. That mother warned
me yesterday.
Words, words! My own child's
blood,
I
see
it now.
(A group of Soldiers enter.)
Another Soldier
.
(
Whispering
.)
Who would have thought
to see tears on
his
face; look you, Jack Richards.
Another Sol
.
'Twas his sister, hush!
Arnold
.
Ay, ay, come hither. Look you there!
Lay down your arms. Seek the royal mercy;here it
is. Your wives, your sisters, and your innocent
children
;let
them seek the royal shelter;it is a safe one.
See.
3d Sol
.
It was just so in Jersey last winter;made
no difference which side you were.
Arnold
.
Ask no reasons.'Twas in sport may be. 'Tis
but one, in many such. Shameless tyranny we have
borne long, and now, for resistance, to red butchery we
are given over. The sport of lawless soldiers, and
savages
more cruel than the fiends in hell, are we, and the
gentle beings of our homes;but, 'tis the Royal power.
Lay down your arms.
Soldiers
.
(
Shouting
.)
No.
Arnold
.
Nay, nay,in its caprice some will be safe,
it may not light on you. See, here's the proclamation.
(
Throwing it among them
.)
Pardon for rebles.
Soldiers
.
Nono.
(
Shouting
.)
Away with pardou!
(
Tearing the proclamation
.)
To the death!
Freedom
for ever!
THE END.
