What
could excite in you any
curiosity as to my affairs? You once knew
me a simple lad, plying the file and
tweezers
at the bench of a watchmaker, with
no prospect before me but of labouring,
for a few years, at least, as a petty and
obscure journeyman, at the same bench
where I worked five years as an
apprentice
.
I was sprung from obscurity,
destitute
of property, of parents, of paternal
friends; was full of that rustic diffidence,
that inveterate humility, which are alone
sufficient to divert from us the stream of
fortune's favours.
Such was I three years ago! Now am I
rich, happy, crowned with every
terrestrial
felicity, in possession of that most
exquisite of all blessings, a wife, endowed
with youth, grace, dignity, discretion.
I do not, on second thoughts, wonder
at your curiosity. It was impossible for
me to have foreseen, absurd to have hoped
for such a destiny. All that has happened,
was equally beyond my expectations and
deservings.
You ask me how all these surprising
things came about? The inclosed letters,
which I have put into a regular series,
contain all the information you wish.
The pacquet is a precious one; you will
find in it, a more lively and exact picture
of my life, than it is possible, by any other
means, to communicate. Preserve it,
therefore, with care, and return it safely
and entire, as soon as you have read it.A
LETTER I.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
New-York

Why
do I write? For whose use do I
pass my time thus? There is no one living who
cares a jot for me. There was a time, when a
throbbing heart, a trembling hand, and eager
eyes were always prepared to read, and
ruminate
on the scantiest and poorest scribble that
dropped from my pen, but she has disappeared.
The veil between us is like death.
Yet why should I so utterly despair of
finding
her? What all my toils may not accomplish,
may be effected at a moment the least expected,
and in a manner the least probable. I may
travel a thousand miles, north and south, and
not find her. I may lingeringly and reluctantly
give up the fruitless search, and return home.
A few hours after, I may stroll, in melancholy,
hopeless mood, into the next street....and meet
her. By such invisible threads is the
unwitting
man led through this maze of life.
But how will she be met? Perhaps....horrid
thought!...she may have become vile, polluted;
and how shall I endure to meet her in that
condition. One so delicate, carrying dignity
to the verge....beyond the verge of pride;
preferring
to starve rather than incur contempt.
But that degradation is impossible.
Yet, if she dreaded not my censure, if she
despaired
not of my acquiescence in her schemes,
why conceal from me her flight? Why not
leave behind her a cold farewel. Could she
be insensible to the torments and inquietudes
which her silence would entail upon me. Could
she question the continuance and fervency of
my zeal for her welfare? What have I done
to estrange her heart, to awaken her
resentment
?
She does not live with Sedley. That
question
Mr. Phillips's report has decided. Atleast
she does not live with him as
his wife
.
Impossible
that Mary Wilmot should be allied to any
man by a different tie. It is sacrilege so much
as to whisper to one's heart the surmise. Yet
have I not written it? Have I not several times
pondered on it? What has so often suggested
these frightful images?
This mysterious, this impenetrable silence
it is, that astounds and perplexes me. This
evident desire, which her conduct betrayed,
to be not sought after by me, and this
departure
in company with Sedley; the man whom
so long a devotion, so many services had not
induced her to suffer his visits. To sever
herself
thus abruptly and forever from
me
, to
whom she had given all her tenderness, with
whom she had divided all her cares, during
years; to whom the marriage promise had been
solemnly pledged, and trust herself, on some
long and incomprehensible journey with one,
whom she had thought it her duty to shun; to
exclude, on all occasions, from her company;
is beyond my comprehension.
But I am tired of the pen already; of
myself
;
of the world.
Ah, Clara! can so groundless a punctilio
govern thee? The settled gloom of thy aspect;
thy agitation, when too tenderly urged by me;
thy tears, that, in spite of heroic resolutions,
will sometimes find way, prove thy heart to be
still mine.
But I will urge thee, I will distress thee no
more. Thy last words have put an end to my
importunity. Can I ever forget them, or the
looks and gestures with which they were
spoken?
I never will be yours! Have I not heard
all your pleas; all your reasonings? And am
I not now furnished with all the means of a
right judgment. I have listened to you twenty
times upon this topic, and always patiently.
Now listen to me.
I never will be yours, while Mary's
condition
is unknown. I never will be yours while
she is single; unmarried to another and
unhappy
.
I will have no intercourse with you.
I will not grant you even my esteem, unless
you search for her; find her; and oblige her
to accept your vows.
There is now no obstacle on account of
fortune.
I
have enough for several, and will
A 2
give you half. All that my parents have, and
you know they are rich, they will either divide
between you and me, or will give entirely to
me. In either case, competence, and even
abundance shall be hers and yours.
'Tis nine months since I first entered this
house: not on the footing of a stranger or a
guest; but of a child. Yet my claims upon my
revered friend are not filial. He loves me,
because all the virtues I possess are of his own
planting and rearing. He that was once the
pupil has now become the son.
How painful and how sweet is the review
of the past year. How benign were the
auspices
under which I entered this house.
Commended
to the confidence and love of their
daughter, treated with complacency, at first;
then with confidence by that daughter; and,
finally, honoured with her love. And yet, a
single conversation; the mention of one
unhappy
name, has reversed totally my condition.
I am still beloved by Clara; but that passion
produces nothing but her misery and mine.
I must go, she tells me; and duty tells me
that I must go in search of the fugitive. I will
not rest till I have ascertained her destiny. Yet
I can forbode nothing but evil. The truth,
whatever it be, will avail me nothing.
I set out to-morrow; meanwhile Clara shall
have this scribble: perhaps, she will not spurn
it. Wilt thou, Clara? Thou once lovedst me:
perhaps, dost love me still: Yet of that I must
entertain some doubts. I part with thee
tomorrow
,
perhaps, forever. This I will put into
thy hands at parting.
LETTER II.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
Hatfield
,
March
20.
You
knew my intention to stop, a few
days, at this place, to see my sisters and my old
friend. I promised to write to you, and inform
you of my welfare. I gave the promise with
coldness and reluctance, because I predicted
that no benefit would flow to either from our
correspondence. Will you believe that I was
a little sullen at our parting; that your seeming
cheerfulness was construed by my perverse
heart, into something very odious? The words
inhuman
and
insensible
girl rose to my lips, and
had like to have been uttered aloud.
I did not reflect, that, since you have
resolved
to pursue a certain path, my regard for
you, if unmixed with selfishness, should prompt
me to wish, that you may encounter as few
asperities as possible, and to rejoice at the
easiness of a sacrifice, which, whether difficult
or easy,
must
be made.
I had not left you a day, before my
inconstant
disposition restored me to my virtuous
feelings. I repented of the coldness with which
I had consented to your scheme of
correspondence
,
and tormented myself with imagining
those pangs which my injustice must have
given you. I determined to repair my fault
as quickly as possible; to write to you often,
and in the strain worthy of one who can enter
into your feelings, and estimate, at its true
value, the motive which governs your actions.
I have, indeed, new and more urgent
motives
for writing. I arrived, at this hospitable
mansion, late in the evening. I have retired,
for the first time, to my chamber, and have
instantly taken up my pen. The nature of the
tidings I send, will justify my haste. I will
relate what has happened, without further
preface
.
I approached my friend's door, and lifted
the latch without giving any signal of my
approach
.
I found the old gentleman, seated with
his pipe, near the fire, and looking placidly on
the two girls, who were busy at draughts, for
which they had made squares on the pine table,
with chalk, and employed yellow and red grains
of corn in place of
pawns
.
They started at my entrance, and, seeing
who it was, threw themselves into my arms,
in a transport of surprise and delight. After
the first raptures of our meeting had passed,
Mr. Hickman said to me; Well, my boy, thou
hast come just in time. Godfry Cartwright
has just carried away letters for thee. He goes
to town to-morrow, and I gave him a pacquet
that has lain here for some time, to put into
the office for thee.
A pacquet? For me? From whom?
When thou knowest the truth, thou wilt be
apt to blame us a little, for our negligence; but
I will tell thee the whole affair, and thou shalt
judge how far we are culpable. A week ago,
I was searching the drawers in my cherry-tree
desk, for the copy of a bond which old
Duckworth
had placed in my hands for safe-keeping,
when I lighted on a bulky pacquet, sealed up,
and inscribed with thy name. I thought it
strange, that a paper of that kind should be
found in my possession, and looked at it again
and again before I could comprehend the
mystery
.
At last I noticed, in the corner, the words
By Mr. Cartwright. Cartwright, thou
knowest is the man we employ to take and
bring letters to and from the city. Hence, I
supposed it to be a pacquet brought by him on
some occasion, and left here for thee; but by
whom it was received, when it was brought,
and how it should chance to repose in this
drawer, I could not guess. I mentioned the
affair to my sister, but she had no knowledge
of the matter. At length, after examining the
pacquet and comparing circumstances, she
gradually recollected its history.
Alack-a-day! cried she, I do remember
something of it now. Cartwright brought it
here, just the same evening of the very day
that poor Edward left here and went to town.
I remember I put it into that drawer,
supposing
that to be as good a place as any to keep it
safe in, till we should hear from the lad, and
so have some inkling whereabouts to send it
to him; but, as I am a living soul, I forgot all
about it from that day to this.
Such is the history of your pacquet, which,
you see, was mislaid through accident and my
sister's bad memory.
This pacquet instantly connected itself, in
my fancy, with the destiny of poor Mary. It
came hither nearly at the time of her flight
from Abingdon. It, no doubt, came from
her, and contained information of unspeakable
moment to our mutual happiness. When I
reflected on the consequences of this
negligence
,
I could scarcely restrain my impatience.
I eagerly inquired for the pacquet.
Not an half-hour ago, said Hickman, I
delivered it to Cartwright, with directions to
put it into the post-office for New-York. He
sets out early in the morning, so that thou wilt
receive it on thy return to New-York.
Cartwright lives five miles from this house.
The least delay was intolerable; and, my horse
not being yet unsaddled, I mounted him
immediately
,
and set out, in spite of
expostulation
and intreaty. The night was remarkably
gloomy and tempestuous, and I was already
thoroughly fatigued; but these considerations
were forgotten.
I arrived at Cartwright's hovel, in less than
an hour, and having gotten the pacquet, I
returned
with equal dispatch. Immediately after,
I retired to my chamber and opened the
pacquet
,
on which I instantly recognised the
well-known hand of Miss Wilmot. I will wave
all comments, and send you the letter.
TO EDWARD HARTLEY.
Abingdon
,
Nov. 11.
I need
not tell you, my friend, what I
have felt, in consequence of your silence. The
short note which I received, a fortnight after
you had left me, roused my curiosity and my
fears, instead of allaying them. You promised
me a longer account of some mysterious
changes that had taken place in your condition.
This I was to receive in a few days. At the
end of a week I was impatient. The promised
letter did not arrive. Four weeks passed away,
and nothing came from you.
Your pacquet has at last put an end to
suspense
:
But why did you not send it sooner?
B
Why not send me your story piece-meal; or,
at least, tell me, in half a line, how you were
employed, and what occasioned your delay?
Why did you not come yourself? Edward, I
am
displeased;
I was going to say,
angry
with
you. You have sported with my feelings. I
ought to lay down my pen while I am in this
humour. The pangs your negligence has given
me, have not yet been soothed to rest, and
when I find that so much unhappiness has been
given through mere heedlessness, I can scarcely
keep my patience.
I was sitting on a bench in the garden, when
a country lad entered the enclosure. As soon
as I caught a glimpse of him, and observed
that his attention was fixed upon me, and his
right hand already in his pocket, my heart
whispered
that this was the bearer of tidings from
you. I attempted to rise and meet him, but
my knees trembled so much, that I was obliged
to give up my design. He drew forth his
pacquet
and threw it into my lap, answering, at the
same time, my inquiries, respecting you, by
telling me that you were well, and that you
had been busy, for a long time, night and day,
in writing that
there
letter to me. He had stopt
a moment to give it, and could not stay, but
merely to receive three lines from me,
informing
you of my health.
You do not deserve the favour. Besides,
my fingers partake the flutterings of my heart.
A tumult of joy and vexation, overpowers me.
But, though you do not merit it, you shall
have a few lines. This paper was spread upon
my lap, and I had taken the pen to write to my
aunt Bowles, but I will devote it to you, though
my tremors, you see, will scarcely permit me
to write legibly.
Your messenger chides my lingering; and
I will let him go with nothing but a verbal
message, for on second thoughts, I will defer
writing till I have read your long letter.
Nov. 15.
Yes; the narrative of Morton is true. The
simple recital which you give, leaves me no
doubt. The money is his, and shall be restored
the moment he demands it. For what I have
spent, I must a little while be his debtor. This
he must consent to lose, for I never can repay
it. Indeed, it is not much. Since my change
of fortune, I have not been extravagant. An
hundred dollars is the most that I have laid
out, and some of this has been in furniture
which I shall resign to him.
Be under no concern, my friend, on my
account. Think not how I shall endure the
evils of my former condition, for I never shall
return to it. Thy Mary is hastening to the
grave, with a very quick pace. That is her only
refuge from humiliation and calamity, and to
that she looks forward with more confidence
than ever.
I was not fashioned of stubborn materials.
Poverty, contempt, and labour, are a burden
too great for me. I know, that for these only,
am I reserved, and this interval of better
prospects
was no comfort to me. I always told you
my brother had no just claim to this money,
and that the rightful claimant would sooner or
later appear. You were more sanguine, and
were willing to incur, even on grounds so
imperfect
,
the irrevocable obligations of
marriage
.
See into what a gulf your rashness would
have hurried you, and rejoice that my obstinacy
insisted on a delay of half a year.
You know my motives for accepting, and
on what conditions I accepted your proffered
vows. I have never concealed from you my
love. What my penetration easily perceived,
your candour never strove to conceal. Your
indifference, your freedom from every thing
like passion, was not only to be seen in your
conduct, but was avowed by your lips. I was
not so base as to accept your hand, without
your heart. You talked of gratitude, and duty,
and perfect esteem. I obtained, you told me,
your entire reverence, and there was no female
in the world whom you loved
so much
. It was
true that you did not love
me
, but you
preferred
me to all other women. Union with me was
your supreme desire. Your reason discerned
and adored my merits, and the concurrence of
the heart could not but follow.
Fondly devoted to you as I was, and urged
as these arguments were, with pathetic
eloquence
,
I could not be deceived for more than
a moment. My heart was filled with
contradictory
emotions. I secretly upbraided you for
obduracy in withholding your love, while I,
at the same time, admired and loved you the
more for your generosity. Your conduct
rendered
the sacrifice of my happiness to yours
the more difficult, while it increased the
necessity
,
B 2
and inforced the justice of that sacrifice.
I could not discover the probability, that
marriage
would give birth to that love which
previous
tenderness and kindness had been unable
to produce. I doubted not your fidelity, and
that the consciousness of conferring happiness
would secure your contentment; but I felt that
this was insufficient for my pride, if not for
my love.
I sought your happiness. To be the author
of it was the object of inexpressible longings.
To be happy without you was impossible, but
the misery of loneliness, however great, was
less than that of being the spectator of your
misery, or even that of defrauding you of the
felicity, attending marriage with a woman
whom you could truly love. Meanwhile, our
mutual poverty was itself an insurmountable
bar to marriage.
My brother's death put me in seeming
possession
of competence. Circumstances were
now somewhat changed. If no claimant
appeared
,
I should be able, by giving myself to
you, to bestow upon the object of my love that
good, the want of which nothing can
compensate
.
There were no other means of rescuing
your sisters and yourself from indigence and
dependence. What I was willing to share with
you, you would not share with me on any
terms but those of wedlock.
Too well did I see on what weak
foundations
was built this scheme of happiness. This
property was never gained by my brother's own
industry, and how could I apply to my own use
what I could not doubt belonged to another,
though that other should never appear to claim
it at my hands.
My reluctance was partly subdued by your
urgency. I consented, waveringly, and with a
thousand misgivings, to be yours at the end of
six months, if no one should appear, meantime,
to make out a good title to this money. I
listened to your arguments and suppositions,
by which you would fain account for my
brother's acquisition of so large a sum
consistently
with honesty, and for his silence as to his
possession of it. I was willing to be convinced,
and consented to sacrifice my peace by
marrying
the man I loved, because this marriage
would secure to him the competence, which I
could not enjoy alone.
This end cannot now be effected. New
reasons have sprung up for foregoing your
affection, even had Morton perished at sea. A
friend has returned to you, who is far more
able to relieve your poverty than I should be.
It is easy to see on what conditions this relief
is intended to be given. He has a daughter,
whom he deems worthy of his adopted son. He
knows your merit, and cannot fail of perceiving
that it places you on a level with the most lovely
and accomplished of human beings.
I see how it is. This Clara will be yours.
That intelligence, that mien, that gracefulness,
which rustic obscurity cannot hide, which the
garb of a clown could never disguise,
accompanied
with the ardent commendations of her
father, will fascinate her in a moment. I cannot
hesitate what to wish, or how to act. That
passion
which a form, homely and uncouth like
mine, tarnished and withered by drudgery and
sorrow, and by comparative old age, for I am
nine years older than you; which a mind, void
of education, and the refinements of learned
and polished intercourse was incapable of
wakening
,
cannot fail to be excited by the youth
and beauty, the varied accomplishments and
ineffable graces of this stranger. She will offer
you happiness, and wealth, and honour, and
you will accept them at her hands.
As for me, I cannot be yours, because I am
not my own. My resolution to be severed from
you is unalterable; but this is not necessary to
insure our separation. It cannot take place,
even if all my wishes were in favour of it.
Long before the expiration of the half year, I
shall be removed beyond your reach. This is
not the illusion of despair. I feel in my deepest
vitals, the progress of death. Nature languishes
within me, and every hour accelerates my
decay.
My friend, thou must not parley with me;
thou must not afflict me with arguments or
intreaties
,
by letters or visits. I must see thee,
and hear from thee no more: but I know thy
character too well to expect this from thee.
As soon as thou receivest this letter, thou wilt
hasten hither, and endeavour to shake my
purpose
.
I am not doubtful of my own constancy,
but I would save myself and thee from a trial
that will answer no end. I shall leave this place
early to-morrow. Whither I am going must
never be told to thee. Thy pursuit and thy
inquiries will be incessant and anxious, but the
measures I have taken for eluding thy search,
will defeat all thy efforts. I know that these
assurances will not dissuade thee from making
them, and I sorrow to reflect on the labours
and anxieties to which thou wilt subject
thyself
for my sake; but I shall derive consolation
from the belief, that my retreat will
never be
discovered
.
I enclose an order on the bank for the
money
that remains in it, drawn in favour of
Morton, and an assignment to him of the few
tables and chairs that furnish my lodgings here.
These thou wilt faithfully deliver into his
hands. I likewise return you your papers and
letters.
And now....Edward....best and most
beloved
of men!....and is it come to this? Must I
bid thee farewel forever?
Do not, I beseech thee, think hardly of me
for what I have done. Nothing but a sense of
duty, nothing but a supreme regard to thy
happiness
,
could suggest my design. I cannot
faulter in the execution, since I could not
waver in the sense of my duty. I am ashamed
of my weakness, that hinders me from
pronouncing
my last farewel.
Make haste to forget the unhappy Mary;
make haste to the feet of your new friend, and
to secure that felicity which an untoward fate
denied me the power of bestowing.
My friend, my benefactor, farewel.
Mary
LETTER III.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
March
24.
I write
to you in a mood not very well
suited to the business. I am weary and
impatient
.
The company which surrounds me is
alien to my temper and my habits. I want to
shut out the tokens of their existence; to
forget where I am, and restore myself to those
rapturous scenes and that blissful period which
preceded my last inauspicious meeting with
Morton.
I write to you, and yet I have nothing to
say that will please you. My heart overflows
with bitterness. I would pour it out upon
you
,
and yet my equity will only add new keenness
to my compunction, when I come to review
what I have written. I am disposed to
complain
.
I want an object to whom to impute my
disasters, and to gratify my malice by
upbraiding
.
There is a kind of satisfaction in revenge
that I want to taste. I want to shift my anxieties
from my own shoulders to those of another,
who deserves the burden more than I.
Your decision has made me unhappy. I
believe your decision absurd, yet I know your
motives are disinterested and heroic. I know
the misery which adherence to your scheme
costs you. It is only less than my own. Why
then should I aggravate that misery? It is the
system of nature that deserves my hatred and
my curses: that system which makes our very
virtues instrumental to our misery.
But chiefly my own folly have I to deplore:
that folly which made me intrust to you the
story of Miss Wilmot, before the bonds had
been formed which no after-repentance could
break. I ought to have forgotten her existence.
I ought to have claimed your love and your
hand. You would have bestowed them upon
me, and my happiness would have been placed
beyond the reach of caprice.
What has wrought this change in my
thoughts? I set out from Hatfield with an
C
heart glowing with zeal for the poor Mary. I
burnt with impatience to throw myself at her
feet, and tender her my vows. This zeal time
has extinguished. I call to mind the perfections
of another. I compare them with those of the
fugitive. My soul droops at the comparison,
and my tongue would find it impossible to utter
the vows, which my untoward fate may exact
from me.
Yet there is no alternative. I must finish
the course that I have begun. I must conjure
up impetuosity and zeal in this new cause. I
must act and speak with the earnestness of
sincerity
and the pathos of hope. Otherwise I
shall betray my cause and violate my duty.
Alas! it is vain to deny it, my powers are not
equal to this task.
I have inquired at the house where Mrs.
Vallentine formerly lived. A new family are
there, and no intelligence of the former tenant
can be gained from them. This lady has friends,
no doubt, in the city; but I know them not. It
is chance alone that can give me their company.
My efforts are languid and my prospects
dim. I shall stay here for as short a time as
possible, and then proceed to Virginia. I will
not rest till I have restored to Mary her own.
This money shall be faithfully delivered. To
add my heart to the gift is impossible. With
less than my affections she will never be
satisfied
,
and they are no longer mine to bestow.
Having performed this duty, what will
remain
for me. My future destiny it will be
your province to prescribe. I shall cease,
however
,
to reason with you, or to persuade.
Decide
agreeably to your own conceptions of
right, and secure to yourself happiness, even
by allotting misery, banishment, or death, to
E. H.
LETTER IV.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,
March
26.
If
I thought the temper which dictated
your last letter would continue beyond the hour
or the night, I should indeed be unhappy. My
life has known much sorrow, but the sharpest
pangs will be those arising from the sense of
your unworthiness.
In my eyes marriage is no sensual or selfish
bargain. I will never
vow to honour
the man
who deserves only my contempt; and my esteem
can be secured only by a just and disinterested
conduct. Perhaps esteem is not the only
requisite
to marriage. Of that I am not certain; but
I know that it is an indispensible requisite to
love. I cannot love any thing in you but
excellence
.
Infatuation will render you hateful
or pitiable in my eyes. I shall hasten to forget
you, and for that end shall estrange myself
from your society, and drop your
correspondence
.
You know what it is that reason prescribes
to you with regard to Miss Wilmot. If you
cannot ardently and sincerely seek her
presence
,
and find in the happiness which she will
derive from union with you, sufficient motives
to make you zealously solicit that union, you
are unworthy not merely of my love, but of
my esteem. Henceforth I will know you not.
Let me not have reason to charge you with
hypocrisy, or to consider your love for me as
the mere child of sensuality and selfishness.
You have often told me that you desire my
happiness above all things. That you love me
for my own sake. Your sincerity and rectitude
are now put to the test. Do not belie your
professions, by a blind and unjust decision.
Allow me to judge in what it is that my
happiness
consists, and prove your attachment to
me by promoting my happiness.
Misguided friend! What is it you want?
To gain your end by exciting my pity?
Suppose
the end should be thus accomplished;
C 2
suppose I should become your wife merely to
save your life, to prevent hazards and
temptations
to which my rejection might expose you.
Mournful, indeed, full of anguish and of tears,
would be the day which should make me your
bride. My act would be a mere submission to
humiliating
and painful necessity. I should look
to reap from such an alliance, nothing but
repinings
and sorrow. By soliciting my hand,
by consenting to ratify a contract made on such
principles, you would irretrievably forfeit my
esteem. My condition would be the most
disastrous
that can betide a human being. I
should be bound, beyond the power of
loosening
my bonds, to one whom I
despised
.
I am, indeed, in no danger of acting upon
these principles. I shall never so little consult
my own dignity and yours, as to accept your
hand
through compassion
. I am not
unacquainted
with the schemes which your foolish
despondency has suggested to you. I know
very well what alternatives you have
sometimes
resolved to offer me; of compliance with
your wishes, or of banishing you to the desert,
and dissolving that connection between my
father and you, which is so advantageous to
yourself and your sisters. Fie upon you I
Even to have entertained such thoughts fixes
a stain upon your character not easily effaced.
Nothing but the hope that the illusion is
transitory
,
and that sober reflection will, in a short
time, relieve you from the yoke of such
cowardly
and ignoble designs, prevents this from
being the last token of friendship you will ever
receive from

LETTER V.
TO MISS HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
March
28.
Clara
, thou hast conquered me. I see
the folly of my last letter, and deplore it. It,
indeed, merited the indignation and the scorn
which it has received. Never shall you again
be grieved and provoked by the like folly. I
am now master of my actions and my thoughts,
and will steadily direct them to a single
purpose
,
the pursuit of the poor Mary, and the
promotion of her happiness.
How inconsistent and capricious is man.
To-day, his resolution and motives are as
adverse
to those of yesterday, as those of one
man, can be, at any time and in any situation, to
those of another. Yesterday! Heaven preserve
me from a repetition of the same thoughts!
I shudder on looking back upon the gulf on the
brink of which I was tottering. How could I
so utterly forget my own interest; the regard
due to the woman who truly loves me; to my
sisters and my noble friend?
But the humiliation is now past. I think
it is: I am sure it is. I am serene, resolute,
and happy. The remorse my errors have
produced
is now at an end. Better thoughts,
resolutions worthy of your pupil and your
friend
have succeeded. Not that my past feelings
have been, perhaps, quite as culpable as you
describe them. My repinings were drawn from
fallacious sources, but they were not wholly
selfish. I imagined you loved me; that my
alliance with another, however sanctioned by
your judgment, would produce some regret.
Believing your judgment misinformed;
believing
these regrets to be needless, I was not
willing to create them. I need not say that
this was
all
my reluctance. That would be
false; but, as they partly originated hence, my
feelings were not wholly selfish, and if I may
judge of my own emotions, surely you wrong
me in calling my passion by the odious name
of sensual.
But these things are past. You have not
done me justice; and in return, I have imputed
to you, feelings of which you knew nothing.
Henceforth, my conduct shall convince you
that I cannot stoop to solicit that boon from
your pity, which is refused by your love.
Conjugal
claims and enjoyments are mutual. The
happiness received is always proportioned to
that conferred. A wretch, worthy of eternal
abhorrence, must
he
be, and endowed with
tyger-like ferocity, who seeks and is contented
with the
person
, while the heart is averse or
indifferent. Such an one, believe me, Clara,
am not I.
On Tuesday, I expect to dispatch all my
concerns in this city, and to proceed
southward
.
Adieu.

LETTER VI.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,
April
1.
There
is an obscurity in your letter,
my friend, that I cannot dispel. The first part
afforded me much pleasure, but the sequel
disappointed me. You seem to have strangely
misconstrued my meaning. Whether this
misconstruction be real or pretended, it does
not become me to enter into any explanation.
If it be real, it affords a proof of a narrow and
ungenerous heart, an heart incapable of
perceiving
the possibility of sacrificing my own
personal gratification to that of another, and
of deriving, from that very sacrifice, a purer
and more lasting felicity. It shews you unable
to comprehend that the welfare of another may
demandself-denial from us, and that in
bestowing
benefits on others, there is a purer delight
than in gratifications merely selfish and
exclusive
.
You question my love, because I exhort
you to do your duty, and to make another
happy that is worthier than I. Why am I
anxious for that other and for you? Why should
I rejoice in your integrity, and mourn for your
degradation? Why should I harbour such
glowing images of the bliss which your Mary
should derive from union with you? Would
not my indifference and negligence on these
heads, would not my ardour to appropriate
your affections to myself, prove me to be...there
is no name sufficiently abhorrent and
contemptuous
for such an heart.
And yet, such is the deportment you expect
from me! Any thing but this will prove me to
be indifferent, or averse to you! Desist, I
beseech you, in time. If you proceed thus,
quickly will you lose what remains of that
esteem which I once felt for you. Instead of
earnestly promoting your alliance with Miss
Wilmot, I shall anxiously obstruct it, on
account of your unworthiness.
D
If this misconstruction be
pretended
only,
if you mean to assail, by this new expedient,
my imaginary weakness; if you imagine, that
in order to remove an unjust imputation from
my character, I will do what will make me
really culpable; if you imagine that I shall
degrade myself in my own estimation, merely
for the purpose of raising myself in yours, you
have grossly deceived yourself.
Formerly you talked, with much
self-complacency
,
of the trials to which I had subjected
my fortitude, and
consoled
yourself with
thinking
that adhering to my new scheme, was
productive
of misery. I say, that you
consoled
yourself with this reflection. In your eyes, my
character was estimable in proportion to the
reluctance with which I performed what was
just. Your devotion to me was fervent in
proportion
as the performance of my duty was
attended with
anguish
and
suffering!
Edward! are you, indeed, so sordid as to
reason in this manner? Are you so blind as to
account this the surest road to my esteem? Are
you not ashamed of your infatuation and
absurdity
?
I need not disguise or deny my
unhappiness
from any pity to you, or through the value
which I set on your esteem. You exult in
proportion
to my misery. You revere me in
proportion as my sentiments are mean and
selfish! I am to be upbraided and despised, in
proportion to the fulness of that enjoyment,
which, the approbation of my conscience, the
sense of doing right myself, and of conferring
good on others, has given me!
Let me constantly hear from you,
respecting
your movements. I am in hopes that time
and reflection will instil into you better
principles
.
Till then, I shall not be displeased, if
your letters be confined to a mere narrative of
your journey.
Adieu.

LETTER VII.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,
April
5
.
You
were to leave Philadelphia on
Tuesday
,
you told me. I imagined the interval
would be engrossed with business, and,
therefore
,
expected not to hear from you, till after
that day; but that day, and the whole week is
past, and no tidings.
This silence does not proceed from
sullenness
.
I hope, I persuade myself, it does not.
Whatever anger you have conceived against
me, let not that, I intreat you, make you
ungrateful
to my father, cruel to your sisters,
unjust to yourself.
Letters have been hourly expected from
you, relative to concerns which you had in
charge. Have you neglected them? Have
you betrayed your trust? Have you suffered an
unmanly dejection to unfit you for this charge?
Have you committed any rashness?
Heaven forbid! Yet, what but some fatal
event has occasioned this delay? Perhaps,
while I thus write to you, you are....
Let me not think of it. I shiver with a
deadly cold at the thought. Thou art fiery and
impetuous, my friend. Thy spirit is not curbed
by reason. There is no outrage on discretion;
no crime against thyself, into which thy
headlong
spirit may not hurry thee.
Perhaps, my last letter was harsh, unjust.
My censures were too bitter. I made not
suitable allowances for your youth; the force
of that attachment which you own for me.
Knew I so little of my own nature, and the
illusions of passion, as to expect you to act and
speak with perfect wisdom.
Would to heaven, I had not written that
letter, or that I had sufficiently considered its
contents before I sent it. It was scribbled
hastily, in a moment of resentment. Of that,
which I so acrimoniously censured in you, I
D 2
was guilty myself. I ought to have staid till
cool reflection had succeeded.
But, perhaps, we torment ourselves
needlessly
.
It is said, that the late storms have
overflowed the rivers, swept away the bridges,
and flooded the roads. Perhaps, your letters
are delayed from this cause. Perhaps, the
ways have been impassable.
Mr. Talbot has been abroad during the
morning. We expect him to return presently.
He may bring us letters.
No intelligence yet received! I am
excessively
uneasy. Your friend is displeased. He
is almost ready to repent the confidence he has
placed in you. Nothing can justify your silence.
Your sickness should not hinder you from
informing
him of certain transactions. Their
importance required you to give him early
notice of any disaster that might befal you,
and common prudence would enjoin you to
take measures for conveying this intelligence
by the hands of others, in case of your
incapacity
....
The coming of the post has been interrupted
only for one day. The reason why we have
not heard from you, can only be your not
having
written. My thoughts are too much
disturbed
to permit me to write any more. I will
lay down the pen, and dispatch this: perhaps,
it may find you, and produce some effect.
C. H.
LETTER VIII.
TO MISS HOWARD.
Schuylkill
,
April
10.
I write
to you by the hand of another.
Be not greatly surprised or alarmed. Perhaps,
my strength is equal to the performance of this
duty for myself, but my good friend and
affectionate
nurse, Mrs. Aston, insists upon
guiding
the pen for me. She sits by my side, and
promises to write whatever I dictate.
My theme is of an interesting and affecting
nature. Perhaps, it might appear to you
improper
to employ any hand but my own.
Circumstances
must apologize for me. I cannot
hold the pen; the friend, whose hand I employ,
deserves my affection and gratitude. On her
discretion I can rely. Besides, I am now
approaching
a bourne, where our scruples and
reserves usually disappear. The suggestions
of self-interest, and the calculations of the
future, are sure to vanish at the approach of
death.
When I wrote you last, I told you my
intention
to leave the city on Tuesday. I
afterwards
received your letter. Your censure was
far more severe than my conscience told me I
deserved. But my own heart did not secure
me from regret. I was highly culpable to allow
my peace to be molested by the tenor of your
letter. In different circumstances, I should
certainly conceal from you, its effect upon my
feelings. I intended to have concealed them
from you. I perceived that, with respect to
you, I was thenceforth to regard myself as a
stranger and an out-cast; and resolved that you
should see me and hear from me no more.
In embracing this scheme, I found no
tranquillity
.
Clara, I loved you, and that love led
me to place my supreme happiness in the
possession
of your heart. For this you call me
sensual and selfish. This, at least, convinced me
of one thing; that the happiness which I formed
to myself, is beyond my reach! It behoved me,
doubtless, to dismiss all fruitless repinings, as
well as to forbear all unprofitable efforts. My
courage was equal to the last, but not to the first.
Though the confession will degrade me still
lower in your opinion. It is now no time to
prevaricate
or counterfeit; and I will not hide
from you my anguish, and dejection. These
did not unfit me for performing my duty to
your father, but they banished health and
repose
from my pillow.
I set out, on Tuesday morning, for
Baltimore
.
The usual floods of this season having
carried away the bridge on Schuylkill, we
prepared
to pass it in a boat. The horses which
drew the stage, being unaccustomed to this
mode of conveyance, and being startled by
the whirlpools and eddies, took fright, when
the boat had gained the middle of the river,
and suddenly rushed out, at the further end,
into the stream.
All the passengers, except two females, had
dismounted from the carriage before it entered
the boat. The air was extremely cold, and
a drizzling shower was falling. These
circumstances
induced the father of the two girls,
who was one of our company, to dissuade them
from alighting, as he imagined no danger
would arise, during the passage. Happily the
passengers and boatmen were behind the
carriage
,
so that, in rushing forward, the horses
drew after them nothing but the coach and
those in it.
The coach and horses instantly sunk. The
curtains, on all sides, had been lowered and
fastened; but the rushing waters burst the
fastenings, and by a miraculous chance, the
two females, who sat on one seat behind, were
extricated in a moment from the poles and
curtains
.
The coach sunk to the bottom, but the
girls presently rose to the surface.
I threw off my upper and under coat in a
moment, and watching the place of their
reappearance
,
plunged into the water, and by the
assistance of others, lifted one breathless corpse
into the boat. Meanwhile, the father, more
terrified
,
and less prudent, threw himself, cloaked
and encumbered as he was, into the water, to
save his children. Instead of effecting this, he
was unable to save himself. No one followed
my example in plunging into the river, and
the father and one of his children perished
together.
The immediate consequence of this
exposure
,
in a feverish state of my frame, was a
violent ague, which gave place to an high
fever and dilerium. I stopt at the inn on the
opposite bank, to change my wet clothes for
dry; but, having done this, was unable to
proceed
,
and betook myself to my bed. I
suspected
nothing more than an intermittent,
which, however violent, during its prevalence,
would pass away in less than an hour. In this
I was mistaken.
My understanding was greatly disturbed.
I had no remembrance of the past, or foresight
of the future. All was painful confusion,
which has but lately disappeared. Clear
conceptions
have returned to me, but my strength
is gone, and I feel the cold of death gradually
gaining on my hearth. My force of mind is
not lessened. I can talk and reason as
coherently
as ever; and my conclusions are far
more wise than while in perfect health.
The family of Mr. Aston, residing in this
neighbourhood, hearing of my condition, have
afforded me every succour and comfort I
needed. It was not till this moment that I
have been able to employ the suitable means
of conveying to you tidings of these events.
Your letter has just been brought me from the
post-office, and my good friend, who now
holds the pen, and who has watched by my
pillow during my sickness, was good enough
to read it to me.
What shall I say? To one regarding me as
selfish and unjust; as even capable of villainy
and foul ingratitude; who, among so many
conjectures, as to the cause of my silence, was
ready to suspect me of breach of faith, the low
guilt of embezzlement! What shall I say?
Nothing: I can say nothing. The prayers
of a dying man for thy felicity, Clara, will, at
least, be accepted as sincere. There is no
personal motive to vitiate this prayer. Thy
happiness must, henceforth, be independent of
mine. I can neither be the author nor
partaker
of it. Be thou, lovely and excellent
woman
!
be happy!
I break off here, to write to your father. I
have much to say to him, which another day,
perhaps, another hour, may forever prevent
me from saying.

LETTER IX.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York

26.
My
father carries you this. The merciful
God grant that he may find you alive! Edward,
is it possible for you to forgive me....But I
deserve
it not. I have lost you forever! My
wickedness and folly merited no less.
My father smiles and says there is hope.
He vows to find you out; to restore you to
health, to bring you back to us alive and happy.
Good God! what horrible infatuation was
it that made me write as I did! If thou diest,
just....just will be my punishment. Never
more will I open my eyes to the light.
My father, my mother, will not suffer me
to go to thee. To see thee once more; to
receive
thy last sigh; to clasp thy cold remains;
to find my everlasting peace in the same grave.
They will not hearken to me; they will not
suffer me to go!
In my frantic thoughts, I ran to the water's
edge. I was stepping into the boat to cross the
river, determined to see thee ere a new day
returned, but I was pursued. I am detained
by force; by intreaties more powerful than
bonds and fetters.
I need not go. Thou art gone forever. My
prayer for forgiveness thou canst not hear.
Heaven has denied me the power to repair the
wrongs that I have done thee. To expiate my
folly, to call thee back to my bosom; and to
give my stubborn heart to thy possession,
cannot
be.

LETTER X.
TO MRS. HOWARD.
Philadelphia,
April
14.
I HAVE been here thirty hours, and have
not written to you. I know your impatience,
and that of your girl; but, till this hour I was
unable to give you information that would
relieve
your fears. Edgar was, indeed, ill. I
found him in a state wholly desperate. He had
not strength to lift his eye-lids at my approach,
or to articulate a welcome.
I found in his chamber his nurse and his
physician. The former is a young lady, newly
married, who resides in this neighbourhood,
and a sister of the person whom our pupil
saved from drowning. She has paid him the
kindest and most anxious attention.
Let me hasten to tell you that the crisis
has passed, and terminated favourably. A
profound
sleep of ten hours, has left him free from
pain and fever, though in a state of weakness
which could not be carried beyond its present
degree, without death.
Set your hearts at rest. The lad is safe. I
promised to bring him back alive and well, and
will certainly fulfil my promise; but some
weeks must elapse before he will be fit for the
journey. You must wait with patience till
then. Farewel.

LETTER XI.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,
April
15.
To
describe the agony which my father's
silence produced, both to my mother and
myself
,
would be useless. Thanks to my God,
you are out of danger. I can now breathe
with freedom.
Tell me, beloved Edward, by your own
hand, or, if your weakness will not suffer it,
by that of your friend, that you forgive me.
O! that I were not at this unfriendly distance
from you! That I could pour out the tears
of my remorse, of my gratitude, of my love,
upon your hand. I am jealous of your lovely
nurse. She is performing those functions
which belong to me.
You are grateful for her services, are you
not? Not more so than I am. Give her my
fervent thanks....but stay, I will give them
myself
.
I will write to her immediately, tell her
of the obligations she has laid upon me, and
solicit her friendship. She is an angel, I am
sure.
Prithee, my friend, make haste and be
well; and fly to us. The arms of thy Clara
are open to receive thee. She is ready to
kneel to thee for pardon; to expiate her
former
obduracy by years of gratitude and
tenderness
.
Lay on my past offences what penalty
thou wilt. The heavier it be the more
cheerfully
shall I sustain it; the more adequate it
will be to my fault.
Mary....My heart droops when I think of
her. How imperfect are schemes of human
felicity. May Heaven assist me in driving
from my mind the secret conviction, that her
claim to your affection is still valid.
Alas! how fleeting is our confidence. Come
to me my friend. Exert all thy persuasive
eloquence
.
Convince me that I have erred in
resigning thy heart and hand to another; in
imagining the claim of Mary better than mine.
I call upon thy efforts to rescue me from
self-condemnation; but I call on thee without
hope. My reason cannot be deceived. The
sense of the injustice I have done her, will
poison every enjoyment which union with thee
can afford me.
Yet come. I repent not of my invitation.
I retract not my promise. Make me
irrevocably
thine. I shall at least be happy while I
forget her, and I will labour to forget her.
Adieu.

TO MISS HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
April
23.
When
you know my reason for not
accompanying
your father, you will approve of
my conduct. I am once more in health, but
could not, at this season, perform the journey
without hazard. Meanwhile, some affairs
remain
to be transacted in this city, to which my
strength is fully equal; and the assurance of
your love, has lulled all my cares to repose.
In less than a week I will be with you.
Rely upon my power to convince you that your
present decision is just. If I had doubts of its
rectitude, your offer, transporting as it is,
would never be accepted.
How little did you comprehend my
character
,
in believing me capable of urging you
to the commission of what I deemed wrong!
And think you that even now I will accept
your hand, unattended with the fullest
concurrence
of your reason? No: but I doubt not
to obtain that concurrence. I will fly to you
on the wings of transport, and armed with
reasons which shall fully remove your scruples.
These reasons, as well as a thousand
affecting
incidents which have lately befallen me, I
will reserve for our meeting. Meanwhile,
place the inclosed portrait in your bosom. It
is that of my
nurse
, Mrs. Aston. She sends
it to you, and desires me to tell you that she
has received your letter, and will answer it
very shortly. Adieu.

LETTER XIII.
TO FRANCIS HARRIS.
Philadelphia
,
April
23.
Do
you wish for some account of my
present
situation? I will readily comply with your
request. I am, indeed, in a mood, just now,
extremely favourable to the telling of a long
story. I have no companions in this city, and
various circumstances, while they give me a
few days solitude and leisure, strongly incline
me likewise to ruminate and moralize on past
adventures.
When I last wrote to you, I told you my
destiny had undergone surprising changes
since we parted. I had then no leisure to enter
into minute particulars. Alas! my friend,
changes still more surprising have since
occurred
,
but changes very different from those to
which I then alluded. Then they were all
benign
and joyous: since, they have been only
gloomy and disastrous.
But how far must I go back to render my
narrative intelligible? You went your voyage,
if I mistake not, just after I was settled with
my uncle and sisters, in the neighbourhood of
Hatfield. I believe you were acquainted with
the beginnings, at least, of my intercourse
with Mr. Howard. I described to you, I
believe
,
the dignified, grave and secluded
deportment
of that man; the little relish he appeared
to have for the society around him, and the
flattering regards he bestowed on me.
I was a mere country lad, with little
education
but what was gained by myself; diffident
and bashful as the rawest inexperience could
make me. He was a man of elevated and
sedate demeanour; living, if not with
splendour
,
yet with elegance; withdrawing in a great
degree from the society of his neighbours;
immersed in books and papers, and wholly
given to study and contemplation.
I shall never forget the occasion on which
he first honoured me with his notice; the
unspeakable
F
delight which his increasing
familiarity
and confidence; my admission to his
house, and my partaking of his conversation
and instructions afforded me. I recollect the
gradual disappearance, in his intercourse with
me, of that reserve and austerity which he still
maintained to the rest of mankind, with
emotions
of gratitude and pleasure unutterable.
He had reason to regard me, indeed,
somewhat
like his own son. I had no father; I had
no property: there was no one among my own
relations, who had any particular claim upon
my reverence or affection. A thousand tokens
in my demeanour, must have manifested a
veneration
for him next to idolatry. My temper
was artless and impetuous, and several little
incidents occurred, during the many years that
I frequented his house, that brought forth
striking proofs of my attachment to him. I
greedily swallowed his lessons, and
remember
how often his eyes sparkled, his
countenance
brightened into smiles, and his tongue
lavished applause on my wonderful docility
and rapid progress. He shewed his affection
for me, by giving his instructions, inquiring
into my situation, and directing me in every
case of difficulty that occurred; but he never
offered to become my real father; to be at the
expense of my subsistence, or my education
to any liberal profession. Indeed, he was
anxious
to persuade me that the farmer's life was
the life of true dignity, and that, however
desirable
to me property might be, I ought to
entertain no wish to change my mode of life.
That was a lesson which he was extremely
assiduous to teach.
He never gave me money, nor ever
suffered
the slightest hint to escape him that he
designed to carry his munificence any farther
than to lend me his company, his conversation
and his books. Indeed, in my attachment to
him, there was nothing sordid or mercenary.
It never occurred to me to reflect on this
frugality
;
this limitation of his bounty. What
he gave was, in my own eyes, infinitely beyond
my merits, and instead of panting after more,
I was only astonished that he gave me so
much. Indeed, had I had wisdom enough to
judge of appearances, I should have naturally
supposed that there existed many others who
had stronger claims upon his fortune than I
had, and might actually enjoy his bounty.
His family and situation were, indeed,
wholly unknown to me and his neighbours.
He was a native of Britain; had not been long
in America; lived alone and in affluence; was
a man past the middle of life; enjoyed a calm,
studious and contemplative existence. This
was the sum of all the knowledge I ever
obtained
of him. Indeed, my curiosity never
carried me into stratagems or guesses, in
order
to discover what he did not voluntarily
disclose, or what he was desirous to conceal.
The mournful day of his departure from
Hatfield, and from America, at last arrived.
I never was taught to believe that he designed
to pass his life in America. I naturally
regarded
him as merely a sojourner, but never
inquired how long he meant to stay among us.
When he told me, therefore, that he should
embark in a week, I felt no surprise, though
it was impossible to conceal my impatience
and regret. I never felt a keener pang than
his last embrace gave me.
He parted with me with every mark of
paternal
tenderness. Yet he left nothing behind
him, as a memorial of his affection. Even the
books that I had often read under his roof,
some of which were my chief favourites, and
would have been prized, for the donor's sake,
beyond their weight in rubies, he carried away
with him. Neither did he explain the causes
of his voyage, or give me any expectation of
seeing him again.
My obligations to Mr. Howard cannot be
measured. To him am I indebted for
whatever
distinguishes me from the stone which
I turned up with my plough, or the stock
which I dissevered with my axe. My
understanding
was awakened, disciplined,
informed
;
my affections were cherished, exercised,
and regulated by him. My heart was
penetrated
with a sentiment, in regard to him....
perhaps, it would be impious to call it
devotion
.
The divinity only can claim that;
yet this man was a sort of divinity to me: the
substitute and representative of heaven, in my
eyes, and for my good.
I besought him to let me accompany him.
I anxiously inquired whether I might cherish
the hope of ever seeing him again. The first
request he made me ashamed of having urged,
by shewing me that I had sisters who needed
my protection, and for whose sake I ought to
F 2
labour to attain independence. His own
destiny
would be regulated by future events, but
be deemed it most probable that we should
never
see each other more.
The melancholy inspired by this
separation
from one who was not only my best, but
my sole friend, was not dissipated, like the
other afflictions of youth, by the lapse of a few
months. Being accompanied with absolute
uncertainty as to his condition and place of
residence, it produced the same effect that his
death would have done. This melancholy,
though no variety of scene could have effaced
it, was, no doubt, aggravated by the cheerless
solitude in which I was placed. The rustic
life was wholly unsuitable to my temper and
taste. My active mind panted for a nobler
and wider sphere of action; and after
enduring
the inconveniences of my sequestered
situation, for some time, I, at length, bound
myself apprentice to a watch-marker in the city.
My genius was always turned towards
mechanics
,
and I could imagine no art more
respectable
or profitable than this.
Shortly after my removal to the city, I
became
acquainted with a young man by the
name of Wilmot. There were many points
of resemblance between us. We were equally
fond of study and reflection, and the same
literary pursuits happened to engage our
passions
.
Hence a cordial and incessant
intercourse
took place between us.
I suppose you know nothing of Wilmot.
Yet possibly you have heard something of the
family. They were of no small note in
Delaware
.
Not natives of the country. The father
was an emigrant, who brought a daughter and
this son with him, when children, from Europe.
He purchased a delightful place on
Brandywine
,
built an house, laid out gardens, and
passed a merry life among horses, dogs, and
boon companions. He died, at length, by a
fall from his horse, when his daughter Mary
was sixteen years of age, and the son four or
five years younger.
These children had been trained up in the
most luxurious manner. The girl had been
her own mistress, and the mistress of her
father's
purse from a very early age. All the
prejudices and expectations of an heiress were
early and deeply imbibed by her; and her
father's character had hindered her from
forming
any affectionate or useful friends of her
own sex, while those who called themselves
his
friends were either merely jovial
companions
or cunning creditors. It very soon
appeared
that Wilmot's fortune had lasted just
as long as his life. House, and land, and stock
were sold by auction, to discharge his
numerous
debts, and nothing but a surplus on the
sale of the furniture, remained to the heirs.
Mary, after a recluse and affluent
education
,
was thus left, at the inexperienced age
of sixteen, friendless and forlorn, to find the
means of subsistence for herself and her
brother
,
in her own ingenuity and industry. It
cannot be supposed that she escaped all the
obvious and enervating effects of such an
education
.
Her pride was sorely wounded by
this reverse, but nature had furnished her with
a vigorous mind, which made it impossible
for her to sink, either into meanness or despair.
She was not wise enough to endure poverty
and straitened accommodations, and a
toilsome
calling, with serenity; but she was
strenuous
enough to adopt the best means for
repairing
the ills that oppressed her.
She retired, with the wreck of her father's
property, from the scene in which she had
been accustomed to appear with a splendour
no longer hers. Her sensibility found
consolation
in living obscure and unknown. For
this end, she removed to the city, took cheap
lodgings in the suburbs, and reduced all her
expences to the most frugal standard. With
the money she brought with her, she placed
her brother at a reputable grammar school,
and her acquaintance, by very slow degress,
extending beyond her own roof among the
good and considerate part of the community,
she acquired, by the exercise of the needle, a
slender provision for herself and her brother.
The boy was a noble and generous spirit,
and endowed with ardent thirst of knowledge.
He made a rapid progress in his learning, and
at the age of sixteen, became usher in the
school in which he had been trained. He was
smitten with the charms of literature; and
greatly to his sisters disappointment and
vexation
,
refused to engage in any of those
professions
which lead to riches and honour. He
adopted certain antiquated and unfashionable
notions about the grandeur of retreat,
honourable poverty, a studious life, and
the dignity of imparting knowledge to others.
The desk, bar, and pulpit, had no attractions
for him. This, no doubt, partly arose from
youthful timidity and self-diffidence, and age
might have insensibly changed his views.
My intercourse with Wilmot, introduced
me, of course, to the knowledge of his sister.
I usually met him at her lodgings. Sundays
and all our evenings were spent together, and
as Mary had few or no visitants, on her own
account, she was nearly on the same footing
of domestic familiarity with me, as with her
brother.
She was much older than I. Humiliation
and anxiety had deeply preyed on her
constitution
,
which had never been florid or robust,
and made still less that small portion of
external
grace or beauty, which nature had
conferred upon her. Dignity, however, was
conspicuous in her deportment, and
intelligence
glowed in her delicate and pliant
features
.
Her manners were extremely mild,
her voice soft and musical, and her
conversation
full of originality and wisdom. The high
place to which she admitted me in her esteem,
and the pleasure she took in my company,
demanded my esteem and gratitude in return.
In a short time, she took place of her brother
in my confidence and veneration.
I never loved Mary Wilmot. Disparity
of age, the dignity and sedateness of her
carriage
,
and perhaps the want of personal
attractions
,
inspired me with a sentiment, very
different from love. Yet there was no
sacrifice
of inclination which I would not cheerfully
have made, in the cause of her happiness.
Though union with her could not give me the
raptures, that fortunate love is said to produce,
it was impossible to find them with another
while she was miserable.
I had no experience of the passions. I knew,
and conversed with no woman but Mary, and
imagined that no human being possessed equal
excellences. I had no counter-longing to
contend
with; and, to say truth, did not suspect
that my regard, for any woman, could possibly
be carried further than what I felt for her.
Mary's knowledge of the heart, the
persuasion
of her own defects, or her refined
conception of the passions, made her less
sanguine
and impetuous. Her love was to be
indisputably requited by a love as fervent,
before she would permit herself to indulge in
hopes of felicity, or allow me to esteem, in her,
my future wife: Our mutual situation, by no
means justified marriage. Secure and regular
means of subsistence were wanting, as I had,
somewhat indiscreetly, bound myself to serve
a parsimonious master, for a much longer
period
than was requisite to make me a proficient
in my art. Meanwhile, there subsisted
between
us, the most affectionate and cordial
intercourse, such as was worthy of her love,
and my boundless esteem.
As long as the possibility of marriage was
distant, this discord of feelings was of less
moment. A very great misfortune, however,
seemed to have brought it, for a time, very
near. Wilmot embarked on the river, in an
evil hour, and the boat being upset by a gust
of wind, was drowned. The brother and
sister
tenderly loved each other, and this calamity
was long and deeply deplored by the survivor.
One unexpected good, however, grew out of
this event. Wilmot was found to be credited
in the bank of P. for so large a sum as five
thousand dollars.
You will judge of the surprise produced
by such a discovery, when I tell you that this
credit appeared to have been given, above two
years before Wilmot's death: that we, his
constant and intimate associates, had never
heard the slightest intimation of his possessing
any thing beyond the scanty income of his
school: that his expences, continued, till the
day of his death, perfectly conformable to the
known amount of this wretched income, and
that no documents could be found among his
papers, throwing any light on the mystery.
I shall not recount the ten thousand fruitless
conjectures, that were formed to account for
this circumstance. None was more probable,
than that Wilmot held this money for
another
.
Mary was particularly confident of the
truth of this conclusion, though, to me, it was
not unembarrassed with difficulties, for why
was no written evidence; no memorandum or
letter to be found respecting the trust; and
why did he maintain so obstinate a silence on
the subject, to us, to whom he was
accustomed
to communicate every action and every
thought?
G
We endeavoured to recollect Wilmot's
conversation and deportment, at the time this
money was deposited, by him, in his own
name, in bank. This clue seemed to lead to
some discovery. I well remembered a
thoughtfulness
,
at that period, not usual in my friend,
and a certain conversation, that took place,
between
us, on the propriety of living on the
bounty of others, when able to maintain
ourselves
by our own industry. In short, I was
extremely willing to conclude that this money
had been a present to Wilmot, from some
paternal friend of his family, or, perhaps, some
kinsman from a distance. At all events, as
this sum had lain undisturbed in bank for two
years, I saw no reason why it should not be
applied to the purpose of subsistence, by his
sister, to whom it now fully belonged.
It was difficult to overcome her scruples.
At length she determined to use as small a
part as her necessities could dispense with, and
to leave the rest untouched for half a year
longer, when, if no claimant appeared, she
might use it with less scruple. This half year
of precaution expired, and nobody appeared
to dispute her right.
She now became extremely anxious to
divide
this sum, gratuitously, with me. To me,
the only obstacle to marriage was, the want of
property. This obstacle, if Mary Wilmot
consented
to bestow her hand, where her heart
had long reposed, would be removed. It was
difficult, however, to persuade her to accept
a man on whom she doated; but who, though
urgent in his proffers, was not as deeply in
love as herself. At length, she consented to
be mine, provided, at the end of another half
year, I should continue equally desirous of the
gift.
At this time, I was become my own
master
,
and having placed Mary in a safe and rural
asylum at Abingdon, I paid a visit of a few
weeks to my uncle near Hatfield. I had been
here scarcely a fortnight, when, one evening,
a stranger whom I had formerly known in my
boyish days, as the son of a neighbouring
farmer
,
paid me a visit. This person had been
abroad, for several years, on mercantile
adventures
,
in Europe and the West-Indies. He
had just returned, and after various ineffectual
inquiries after Wilmot, with whom he had
been formerly in habits of confidence, he had
come to me, in the prosecution of the same
search.
After various preliminaries, he made me
acquainted with the purpose of his search. The
substance of his story was this: After toiling
for wealth, during several years, in different
ports of the Mediterranean, he at length
acquired
what he deemed sufficient for frugal
subsistence in America. His property he
partly invested in a ship and her cargo, and
partly in a bill of exchange for
five thousand
dollars
. This bill he transmitted to his friend
Wilmot, with directions to reserve the
proceeds
till his arrival. He embarked,
meanwhile
,
in his own vessel, sending, at the same
time, directions to his wife, who was then at
Glasgow, to meet him in America.
Unfortunately the ship was wrecked on the
coast of Africa; the cargo was plundered or
destroyed by the savage natives, and he, and
a few survivors, were subjected to innumerable
hardships, and the danger of perpetual
servitude
.
From this he was delivered by the agents
of the United States, in consequence of a treaty
being ratified between
us
and the government
of Algiers. Morton was among the miserable
wretches whose chains were broken on that
occasion, and he had just touched the shore of
his native country.
His attention was naturally directed, in the
first place, to the fate of the property
transmitted
to Wilmot. Wilmot, he heard, died
suddenly
.
Wilmot's sister, his only known
relation
,
was gone nobody could tell whither. The
merchant, on whom his bills had been drawn,
was partner in an Hamburg house, to which
he had lately returned. The ships in which
he sent his letters, had safely arrived. His
bills had never been protested at any of the
notaries, but all the written evidences of this
transaction, that had remained in his own
hands, had been buried, with his other property,
in the waves.
After some suspense, and much inquiry,
he was directed to me, as the dearest friend of
Wilmot, and the intended husband of his
sister.
You will see, my friend, that the mystery
which perplexed us so long, was now at an
end. The coincidence between the sum
remitted
,
and that in our possession, and between
the time of the probable receipt of the bills, and
G 2
that of the deposit made by Wilmot at the
bank, left me in no doubt as to the true owner
of the money.
I explained to Morton, with the utmost
clearness and simplicity, every particular
relative
to this affair. I acknowledged the
plausibility
of his claim; assured him of miss
Wilmot's readiness, and even eagerness, to do
him justice, and promised to furnish him, on
his return to Philadelphia, with a letter,
introducing
him to my friend. We parted.
This was a most heavy and unlooked-for
disappointment of all our schemes of happiness.
My heart bled with compassion for the forlorn
and destitute Mary. To be thus rescued from
obscurity and penury, merely, to have these
evils augmented by the bitterness of
disappointment
,
was an hard lot.
I was just emancipated from my servitude.
I was perfectly skilled in my art, but mere skill
might supply myself with scanty bread,
without
enabling me to support a family. For that
end, credit to procure an house, and the means
of purchasing tools and materials, were
necessary
;
but I knew not which way to look for
them.
My nearest relation was my uncle Walter,
who had taken me and my sisters, in our
infancy
,
into his protection, and had maintained
the girls, ever since. His whole property,
however, was a small farm, whose profits were
barely sufficient to defray the current expences
of his family. At his death, this asylum would
be lost to us, as his son, who would then
become
the occupant, had always avowed the
most malignant envy and rancorous aversion
to us. As my uncle was old, and of a feeble
constitution, and as the girls were still young,
and helpless, I had abundant theme on my
own account, for uneasy meditation. To these
reflections were added the miseries, which this
reverse of fortune, would bring down upon
the woman whom I prized beyond all the world.
One day, while deeply immersed in such
contemplations as these, and musefully and
mournfully pacing up and down the piazza of
the inn at Hatfield, a chaise came briskly up
to the door and stopped. I lifted my eyes, and
beheld, alighting from it, a venerable figure,
in whom I instantly recognized my friend and
benefactor, Mr. Howard. The recognition was
not more sudden on my side than on his, though
a few years, at my age, were sufficient to
produce
great changes in personal appearance.
Surprise and joy nearly deprived me of my
senses, when he took me in his arms and
saluted
me in the most paternal manner. We
entered the house, and as soon as I regained
my breath, I gave utterance to my transports,
in the most extravagant terms.
After the first emotion had subsided, he
informed me that the sole object of his present
journey to Hatfield, was a meeting with me.
He had just arrived, with a wife and daughter,
in America, where he designed to pass the
rest of his days. It was his anxious hope to
find me well and in my former situation, as he
was now able to take the care of providing for
me into his own hands. He inquired minutely
into my history since we parted. I could not
immediately conquer my reserve, on that
subject
,
that was nearest my heart; but in other
respects, I was perfectly explicit.
My narrative seemed not to displease him,
and he condescended in his turn, to give me
some insight into his own condition. I now
discovered
that he was sprung from the younger
branch of a family, at once, ancient and noble.
He received an education, more befitting his
birth than his fortune; and had, by a
thoughtless
and dissipated life, wasted his small
patrimony
.
This misfortune had contributed
to tame his spirit, to open his eyes on the folly
of his past conduct, and to direct him in the
choice of more rational pursuits.
He was early distinguished by the
favourable
regards of a lady of great beauty and
accomplishments
.
This blessing he did not
prize as he ought. Though his devotion to
Clara Lisle was fervent, he suffered the
giddiness
of youth, and the fascinations of pleasure,
to draw him aside from the path of his true
interest. Her regard for him made her
overlook
many of his foibles, and induced her to
try various means to restore him to virtue and
discretion. These effosts met with various
success, till, at length, some flagrant and
unexpected
deviation, contrary to promises, and
in defiance of her warnings, caused a breach
between them that was irreparable.
The head of the nobler branch of Mr.
Howard's
family, was a cousin, a man of an
excellent
,
though not of shining character. He had
long been my friend's competitor for the favour
of miss Lisle. The lady's friends were his
strenuous advocates, and used every
expedient
of argument or authority, to subdue her
prepossessions for another. None of these
had any influence, while my friend afforded
her any hopes of his reformation. His rashness
and folly, having, at length, extinguished these
hopes, she complied, after much reluctance
and delay, with the wishes of her family.
This event, communicated by the lady
herself in a letter to my friend, in which her
motives were candidly stated, and the most
pathetic admonitions were employed to point
out the errors of his conduct, effected an
immediate
reformation. The blessing which he
neglected or slighted, when within his reach,
now acquired inestimable value. His regrets
and remorses were very keen, and terminated
in a resolution to convert the wreck of his
fortune
into an annuity, and retire for the rest of
his life, to America. This income, though
small, was sufficient, economically managed,
to maintain him decently, at such a village as
Hatfield.
His residence here, at a distance from
ancient
companions, and from all the usual
incitements
to extravagance, completed, in a few
years, a thorough change in his character. He
became, as I have formerly described him,
temperate
,
studious, gentle, and sedate. The
irksomeness
of solitude, was somewhat relieved,
by his acquaintance with me, and by the efforts,
which his growing kindness for poor Ned,
induced him to make for improving and
befriending
the lad. These efforts, he imagined
to be crowned with remarkable success, and
gradually concentred all his social feelings in
affection for me. He resolved to be a father
to me while living, and to leave his few
movables
,
all he had to leave, to me, at his death.
These prospects were somewhat disturbed,
by intelligence from home, that his cousin was
dead.
Eighteen years absence from his native
country, and from miss Lisle, had greatly
strengthened his attachment to his present
abode, but had not effaced all the impressions
of his youth. The recollection of that lady's
charms, her fidelity to him in spite of the
opposition
of her family, and of his own
demerits
,
her generous efforts to extricate him from
his difficulties, which even proceeded so far,
as to pay, indirectly, and through the agency of
others, a debt for which he had been arrested,
always filled his heart with tenderness and
veneration
.
These thoughts produced habitual
seriousness, gratitude to this benefactor, an
ardent zeal to fulfil her hopes by the dignity
of his future deportment; but was not attended
with any anger or reget at her compliance with
the prudent wishes of her family, and her
choice of one infinitely more worthy than
himself
.
At this he sincerely rejoiced, and felt a
pang, at the news of that interruption to her
felicity, occasioned by her husband's death.
This event, however, came gradually to be
viewed with somewhat different emotions.
He began to reflect, that a tenderness so
fervent
as was once cherished for him, was not
likely to be totally extinguished, by any thing
but death. His cousin, though a man of worth,
had been accepted from the impulse of
generosity
and pity, and not from that of love. She
had been contented, and perhaps, happy in her
union with him; but, if her first passion was
extinct, he imagined there would be found
no very great difficulty in reviving it. Both
were still in the prime of life, being under
thirty-eight years of age.
The correspondence, so long suspended,
was now renewed between them; and Mr.
Howard, with altered views, and renovated
hopes, now embarked for that country which
he had believed himself to have forever
abjured
.
This new state of his affairs, by no
means lessened his attachment to the fortunate
youth, who had been, for eight years, the sole
companion of his retirement. While his own
destiny was unaccomplished, he thought it
proper
to forbear exciting any hopes in me. Should
his darling purpose be defeated, he meant
immediately
to return. Should he meet with
success, and his present views, as to the
preference
due to America, as a place of abode,
continued, he meant to exert his influence with
the elder and younger Clara, for his cousin had
left behind him one child, a daughter, now in
the bloom of youth, to induce them to
emigrate
.
In every case, however, he was resolved
that the farmer-boy should not be forgotten.
His projects were crowned, though not
immediately
,
with all the success to be desired.
The pair, whom so many years, and so wide an
H
interval had severed, were now united, and
the picture, which Mr. Howard drew, of the
American climate and society, obtained his
wife's consent to cross the ocean.
My dear Ned, said Mr. Howard to me,
after relating these particulars, I have a
pleasure
in this meeting with you, that I cannot
describe. You are the son, not of my instincts,
but of my affections and my reason. Formerly
I gave you my advice, my instructions, and
company only, because I had nothing more to
give. Now I am rich, and will take care that
you shall never be again exposed to the chances
of poverty. Though opulent, I do not mean
to be idle. He that knows the true use of riches,
never can be rich enough; but my occupation
will leave me leisure enough for enjoyment;
and you, who will share my labour, shall
partake
liberally of the profit. For this end, I
mean to admit you as an inseparable member
of my family, and to place you, in every respect,
on the footing of my son.
My family consists of my wife and her
daughter. The latter is now twenty-three, and
you will be able to form a just conception of her
person and mind when I tell you, that in both
respects, she is exactly what her mother was
at her age. There is one particular, indeed,
in which the resemblance is most striking. She
estimates the characters of others, not by the
specious but delusive considerations of fortune
or birth, but by the intrinsic qualities of heart
and head. In her marriage choice, which yet
remains to be made, she will forget ancestry
and patrimony, and think only of the morals and
understanding of the object. Hitherto, her
affections
have been wholly free, but...here Mr.
Howard fixed his eyes with much intentness
and significance, on my countenance...her
parents
will neither be grieved nor surprised, if,
after a residence of some time under the same
roof with her
brother
Edward, she should no
longer be able to boast of her freedom in that
respect. If ever circumstances should arise
to put my sincerity to the test, you shall never
find me backward to convince you that I
practise
no equivocations and reserves, and
prescribe
no limitations or conditions, when I
grant you the privilege of calling me father.
My stay with you at present must be short.
I am now going, on business of importance, to
Virginia. I shall call here on my return,
which I expect will be soon, and take you with
me to New-York, where I purpose to reside
for some time. The interval may be useful
to you, in settling and arranging your little
matters, and equipping yourself for your
journey
.
Such, my friend, was the result of this
meeting with Mr. Howard. Every thing
connected
with this event, was so abrupt and
unexpected, that my mind was a scene of
hurry and confusion, till his departure, next
morning, left me at liberty to think on what
had past. He left me with marks of the most
tender affection, with particular advice in what
manner to adjust my affairs, and with a
promise
of acquainting me by letter with all his
motions.
I waited with some impatience for Mr.
Howard's return. Many things had dropped
from him, in our short interview, on which I
had now leisure to reflect. His views, with
regard to me, could not fail to delight my
youthful fancy. I was dazzled and enchanted
by the prospect which he set before me, of
entering on a new and more dignified
existence
,
of partaking the society of beings like
Mrs. Howard and her daughter, and of aiding
him in the promotion of great and useful
purposes
.
One intimation, however, had escaped him,
which filled me with anxious meditations.
The young Clara was the companion of his
voyage hither. She had landed on this shore.
To her presence and domestic intercourse, I
was about to be introduced, and I was allowed
to solicit her love. He was willing to bestow
her upon me, and had, without doubt, gained
the concurrence of her mother in this scheme.
It was thus that he meant to insure the
felicity
,
and establish the fortune, of his pupil.
There is somewhat in the advantages of
birth and rank, in the habit of viewing objects
through the medium of books, that gives a
sacred obscurity, a mysterious elevation, to
human beings. I had been familiar with the
names of nobility and royalty, but the things
themselves had ever been shrouded in an
awe-creating
darkness. Their distance had
likewise
produced an interval, which I imagined
impossible for me to overpass. They were
objects to be viewed, like the divinity, from
afar. The only sentiments which they could
H 2
excite, were reverence and wonder. That I
should ever pass the mound which separated
my residence, and my condition, from theirs,
was utterly incredible.
The ideas annexed to the term
peasant
, are
wholly inapplicable to the tillers of ground in
America; but our notions are the offspring,
more of the books we read, than of any other
of our external circumstances. Our books are
almost wholly the productions of Europe, and
the prejudices which infect us, are derived
chiefly from this source. These prejudices may
be somewhat rectified by age, and by converse
with the world, but they flourish in full vigour
in youthful minds, reared in seclusion and
privacy
,
and undisciplined by intercourse with
various classes of mankind. In me, they
possessed
an unusual degree of strength. My
words were selected and defined according to
foreign usages, and my notions of dignity
were modelled on a scale, which the
revolution
has completely taken away. I could never
forget that my condition was that of a
peasant
,
and in spite of reflection, I was the slave of
those sentiments of self-contempt and
humiliation
,
which pertain to that condition
elsewhere
,
though chimerical and visionary on the
western side of the Atlantic.
My ambition of dignity and fortune grew
out of this supposed inferiority of rank.
Experience
had taught me, how slender are the
genuine wants of an human being, and made
me estimate, at their true value, the blessings
of competence, and fixed property. Our fears
are always proportioned to our hopes, and
what is ardently desired, appears, when placed
within our reach, to be an illusion designed
to torment us. We are inclined to question
the reality of that which our foresight had
never suggested as near, though our wishes
had perpetually hovered around it.
When the death of Wilmot put his sister
in possession of a sum of money, which, when
converted into land, would procure her and
the man whom her affection had distinguished,
a domain of four or five hundred fertile acres,
my emotions I cannot describe. Many would
be less affected in passing from a fisherman's
hovel, to the throne of an opulent nation. It so
much surpassed the ordinary bounds of my
foresight, and even of my wishes, that, for a
time, I was fain to think myself in one of my
usual wakeful dreams. My doubts were
dispelled only by the repetition of the same
impressions, and by the lapse of time. I
gradually became familiarized to the change,
and by frequently revolving its benefits and
consequences, raised the tenor of my ordinary
sensations to the level, as it were, of my new
condition.
From this unwonted height, Morton's
reappearance
had thrown us down to our
original
obscurity. But now my old preceptor had
started up before me, and, like my good
genius, had brought with him gifts
immeasurable
,
and surpassing belief. They existed
till now in another hemisphere; they occupied
an elevation in the social scale, to which I
could scarcely raise my eyes; yet they were
now within a short journey of my dwelling.
I was going to be ushered into their presence;
but my privilege was not to be circumscribed
by any sober limits. This heiress of opulence
and splendour, this child of fortune, and
appropriator
of elegance and grace, and beauty,
was proffered to me as a wife!
I reflected on the education which I had
received from Mr. Howard; his affection for
me, which had been unlimited; his relation
to his wife's daughter, and the authority and
respect....which that relation, as well as his
personal qualities, produced. I reflected on
the futility of titular distinction; on the
capriciousness
of wealth, and its independance of
all real merit, in the possessor, but still I
could not retain but for a moment, the
confidence
and self-respect which flowed from
these thoughts. I was still nothing more than
an obscure clown, whose life had been spent
in the barn-yard and corn-field, and to whose
level, it was impossible for a being qualified
and educated like Clara, ever to descend.
You must not imagine, however, that this
descent was desired by me. I was bound, by
every tie of honour, though not of affection,
to Mary Wilmot. Incited by compassion and
by gratitude, I had plighted my vows to her,
and had formed no wish or expectation of
revoking them. These vows were to be
completed
,
in a few months, by marriage; but
this event, by the unfortunate, though
seasonable
and equitable claim of Morton, was placed
at an uncertain distance. Marriage, while
both of us were poor, would be an act of the
utmost indiscretion.
What, however, was taken away by
Morton
,
might, I fondly conceived, be restored
to us by the generosity of Mr. Howard. It
was not, indeed, perfectly agreeable to the
dictates of my pride, to receive fortune as the
boon of any one; but I had always been
accustomed
to regard Mr. Howard more as my
father than teacher, and it seemed as if I had
a natural right to every gift which was
needful
to my happiness, and which was in his
power to bestow.
Mary and her claims on me, were indeed,
unknown to my friend. He had no reason to
be particularly interested in her fate; and her
claims interfered with those schemes which
he had apparently formed, with relation to
Clara and myself. How, I asked, might he
regard her claims? In what light would he
consider that engagement of the
understanding
,
rather than of the heart, into which I had
entered? How far would he esteem it proper
to adhere to it; and what efforts might he
make to dissolve it?
Various incidents had hindered me from
thoroughly explaining to him my situation,
during his short stay at Hatfield; but I resolved
to seize the opportunity of our next meeting,
and by a frank disclosure, to put an end to all
my doubts. Meanwhile, I employed the
interval
of his absence, in giving an account of
all these events to Mary, and impatiently
waited the arrival of a letter. The period of
my friend's absence was nearly expired, and
the hourly expectation of his return prevented
me from visiting Mary in person. Instead
of his coming, however, I at length received
a letter from him in these terms:
Richmond
,
Nov
. 11.
I shall
not call on you at Hatfield. I
am weary of traversing hills and dales; and
my detention in Virginia being longer than I
expected, shall go on board a vessel in this
port, bound for New-York. Contract, in my
name, with your old friend, for the present
accommodation of the girls, and repair to
New-York as soon as possible. Search out
No......., Broadway. If I am not there to
embrace
you, inquire for my wife or niece, and
mention your name. Make haste; the women
long to see a youth in whose education I had
so large a share; and be sure, by your
deportment
,
not to discredit your instructor, and
belie my good report.
Howard
.
Being, by this letter, relieved from the
necessity of staying longer at Hatfield, I
prepared
to visit my friend at Abingdon. Some
six or seven days had elapsed since my
messenger
had left with her my last letter, and I
had not since heard from her. I had been
enjoined to repair to New-York with
expedition
,
but I could not omit the present
occasion
of an interview with Mary. Morton's
claim would produce an essential change in
her condition, and I was desirous of
discussing
with her the validity of this claim, and the
consequences of admitting it.
I had not seen Morton since his first visit.
I now, in my way to Abingdon, called at his
father's house.
The old man appeared at the door. His
son had visited and stayed with him a few
days, but had afterwards returned to the city.
He had gone thither to settle some affairs,
and had promised to come back in a few
weeks. He knew not in what affairs he was
engaged; could not tell how far he had
succeeded
,
or whereabout in the city he resided.
I proceeded to Abingdon, not without
some expectation of Morton's having already
accomplished his wishes, and persuaded my
friend to refund the money; and yet, in a case
of such importance, I could not easily believe
that my concurrence, or at least, advice,
would be dispensed with.
I went to her lodgings as soon as I arrived.
I had procured her a pleasant abode, at the
house of a lady who was nearly allied to my
uncle, and where the benefits of decent and
affectionate society could be enjoyed without
leaving her apartments. Mrs. Bordley was
apprized of the connection which subsisted
between her inmate and me, and had
contracted
and expressed much affection for her
guest. On inquiring for miss Wilmot, of her
hostess, she betrayed some surprise.
1
Mary Wilmot? she answered, that is a
strange question from you: surely you know
she is not here.
Not here? cryed I, somewhat startled;
what has become of her?
You do not know then that she has left us
for good and all?
No, indeed; not a syllable of any such
design has reached me; but whither has she
gone?
That is more than I can say. If you are
uninformed on that head, it cannot be
expected
that I should be in the secret. I only
know, that three days ago she told me of her
intention to change her lodgings, and she did so
accordingly, yesterday morning, at sun rise.
But what was her motive? What cause of
dislike did she express to this house? I
expected
she would remain here, till she changed
it for an house of her own.
Why indeed that may be actually the case
now, for she went away with a very spruce
young gentleman, in his chaise; but that
cannot
be. Poor creature! She was in no state for
so joyous a thing as matrimony. She was
very feeble; nay, she was quite ill: she had
scarcely left her bed during five days before,
and with difficulty got out of it, and dressed
herself, when the chaise called for her. She
would eat nothing, notwithstanding all my
persuasion, and the pains I took to prepare
some light nice thing, such as a weak stomach
could bear. When she told me she meant
to leave my house, I was as much surprised
as you, and inquired what had offended or
displeased her in my behaviour. She assured
me that she had been entirely satisfied, and
that her motives for leaving me had no
connection
with my deportment. There was a
necessity for going, though she could not
explain
to me what it was. I ventured to ask
where she designed to go, but she avoided
answering me for some time; and when I
repeated the question, she said, she could not
describe her new lodgings. She knew not in
what spot she was destined to take up her rest,
and confessed, that there were the most cogent
reasons for her silence on that head. I
mentioned
the coldness of the weather, and her
own ill-health, but she answered, that no
option had been left her, and that she must go, if
it were even necessary to carry her from her
bed to the carriage. All this, as you may well
suppose, was strange, and I renewed my
questions and intreaties, but she gave me no
satisfaction, and persisted in her resolutions.
Accordingly, on Thursday morning, a chaise
stopped at the door, took her in, with a small
trunk, and hastened away.
I was confounded and perplexed at this
tale. No event was less expected than this.
No intimation had even been dropped by
Mary, that created the least suspicion of this
design. She had left, as Mrs. Bordley
proceeded
to inform me, all her furniture,
without
direction to whom, or in what manner to
dispose of it, and yet had said, that she never
designed to return. The gentleman with
whom she departed, was unknown to Mrs.
Bordley, and had stopt so short a time as not
to suffer her to obtain, by remarks or
interrogatories
,
any gratification of her curiosity.
Having ineffectually put a score of
questions
to Mrs. Bordley, I entered the deserted
apartments. The keys of closets and drawers
no where appeared, though the furniture was
arranged as usual. Inquiring of my
companion
for these, Ay, said she, I had almost
forgotten. The last thing she said before the
chair left the door, holding out a bunch of
keys to me, was, Give these to....there her
voice faultered, and I observed the tears flow.
I received the keys, and though she went
away without ending her sentence, I took
for granted it was you she meant.
I eagerly seized the keys, and hoped, by
their assistance, to find a clue to this labyrinth.
I opened the closets and drawers and turned
over their contents, but found no paper which
would give me the intelligence I wanted. No
script of any kind appeared; nothing but a
few napkins and sheets, and the like cumbrous
furniture. A writing-desk stood near the
wall, but blank paper, wafers, and quills, were
all that it contained. I desisted, at length,
from my unprofitable labour, and once more
renewed my inquiries of Mrs. Bordley.
She described the dress and form of the
young man who attended the fugitive. I
could not at first recognize in her description
any one whom I knew. His appearance
bespoke
him to be a citizen, and he seemed to
have arrived from the city, as well as to return
thither. She dwelt with particular emphasis on
I 2
the graces of the youth, and frequently
insinuated
that a new gallant had supplanted the old.
For some time, I was deaf to these
surmises
;
but, at length, they insensibly revived
in my fancy, and acquired strength. I began
to account for appearances so as to justify
my suspicion. She had not informed me of
her motions; but that might arise from
compunction
and shame. There might even be
something illicit in this new connection, to
which necessity might have impelled her.
The claims of Morton were made known to
her by me, but possibly they had been
previously
imparted by himself. To shun that
poverty to which this discovery would again
reduce her, she listened to the offers of one,
whose opulence was able to relieve her wants.
The notion that her conduct was culpable,
vanished in a moment, and I abhorred myself
for harbouring it. I remembered all the
proofs of a pure and exalted mind, impatient
of contempt and poverty, but shrinking with
infinitely more reluctance from vice and
turpitude
,
which she had given. I called to mind
her treatment of a man, by name, Sedley, who
had formerly solicited her love, and this
remembrance
gave birth to a new conjecture
which subsequent reflection only tended to
confirm.
Sedley had contracted a passion for Mary
six or eight years ago. He was a man of
excellent
morals, and heir to a great fortune.
He had patrimony in his own possession, and
had much to hope for from his parents. These
parents hated and reviled the object of their
son's affections merely because she was poor,
and their happiness seemed to depend on his
renouncing her. To this he would never
consent
,
and Mary might long ago have removed
all the evils of her situation, had she been
willing
to accept Sedley's offers; but though she
had the highest esteem for his virtues, and
gratitude for his preference, her heart was
anothers. Besides, her notions of duty, were
unusually scrupulous. Her poverty had only
made her more watchful against any
encroachments
on her dignity, and she disdained
to enter a family who thought themselves
degraded by her alliance.
Sedley was a vehement spirit. Opposition
whetted, rather than blunted his zeal; and
Mary's conduct, while it heightened his
admiration
and respect, gave new edge to his
desires
.
The youth whom she loved did not
admit a mutual affection, and his poverty
would have set marriage at an hopeless
distance
,
even if it had been conceived. Sedley,
therefore, believed himself the only one
capable
of truly promoting her happiness, and
persisted
in courting her favour longer and with
more constancy than might have been
expected
from his ardent feelings and versatile age.
I need not repeat that Mary's affections
were mine. To Sedley, therefore, I was the
object of aversion and fear, and there never
took place between us intercourse sufficient to
subdue his prejudices. After her brother's
death, marriage was resolved upon between
us, and Sedley at length slackened the ardour
of his pursuit. Still, however, he would not
abjure her society.
Some secret revolution, perhaps, had been
wrought in the mind of my friend. Her
consent
to marriage, had been extorted by me,
for she was almost equally averse to marriage
with one by whom she was not loved with
that warmth which she thought her due, as
with one who possessed every title to
preference
but her love. These scruples had been
laid aside in consideration of the benefit which
her brother's death, by giving her property,
enabled her to confer upon me who was
destitute
.
This benefit it was no longer in her
power to confer. She would consider herself
as severed from me forever, and in this state
a renewal of Sedley's importunities, might
subdue her reluctance. On comparing Mrs.
Bordley's description of the voice, features,
garb, and carriage of Mary's attendant, with
those of Sedley, I fancied I discovered a
strong resemblance between them. Some
other coincidences, which came to light in
the course of the day, made me certain as to
the person of her companion. It was Sedley
himself.
I was willing to gain all the knowledge of
this affair which was within reach. Sedley's
usual place of abode was his father's house in
Virginia, but he chiefly passed his time in
Philadelphia
,
where he resided with his sister,
who was a lady of great merit, and left, by her
husband's death, in opulent circumstances.
This lady had made frequent overtures of
friendship to Mary, but these had, for the most
part, been declined. This reserve was not
wholly free from pride. A mistaken
sensibility
made her shun those occasions for
contempt
or insult which might occur in her
intercourse
with the rich. The relation in which
she stood to Sedley was another impediment.
A just regard for his happiness compelled her
to exclude herself as much as possible from his
company. The kindness of Mrs. Valentine
had not been diverted by these scruples and
reserves, and some intercourse had taken place
between them before Mary's retirement to
Abingdon.
This change of views in my friend had
given me much disquiet, but some reflection
convinced me that it was a cause of rejoicing
rather than regret. Wedlock had been desired
by me, more from zeal for the happiness of
another
,
than for my own. I had lamented that
destiny which made the affections of three
persons
merely the instruments of their misery,
and had exerted my influence to give a new
direction to my friend's passions. This
undertaking
was no less delicate than arduous, and
no wonder, that in hands so unskilful as mine,
the attempt should fail. I could not be much
displeased that this end was effected, though
I was somewhat mortified on finding that she
did not deem me worthy of being apprized of
her schemes. I reflected, however, that this
information might only be delayed; and
imagined
a thousand plausible reasons which might
induce her to postpone intelligence so
unexpected
,
if not disagreeable to me.
Next morning I repaired to the city, and
to Mrs. Valentine's house. I inquired of a
female servant for Miss Wilmot, but was told
that she had been there, a few hours, on the
preceding Thursday, and had then gone, in
company with her mistress and Mr. Sedley,
to New-York. No time had been fixed for
their return, but Mrs. Valentine had said that
her absence might last for six or eight months.
The steward, who might afford me more
information
,
was out of town.
Thus my conjectures were confirmed; and
having no reason for further delay, I
immediately
set out in the same road. My thoughts,
disembarrassed from all engagements with
Mary, persuaded of her union with Sedley,
and convinced that this union would more
promote
her happiness than any other event, I
returned without reluctance to Clara Howard.
I was impatient to compare those vague and
glittering conceptions which hovered in my
fancy, with the truth; therefore adopted the
swiftest conveyance, and arrived, in the
evening
of the same day, at Powle's Hook ferry.
My excursions had hitherto been short and
rare, and the stage on which I was now
entering
,
abounded with novelty and grandeur.
The second city in our country was familiar to
my fancy by description, but my ideas were
disjointed and crude, and my attention was
busy in searching, in the objects which
presented
themselves, for similitudes which were
seldom to be met with. A sort of tremulous,
but pleasing astonishment, overwhelmed me,
while I gazed through the twilight, on the
river and the city on the further shore. My
sensations of solemn and glowing expectation
chiefly flowed from the foresight of the
circumstances
in which I was preparing to place
myself.
Men exist more for the future than the
present
.
Our being is never so intense and vivid,
if I may so speak, as when we are on the eve
of some anticipated revolution, momentous to
our happiness. Our attention is attracted by
every incident that brings us nearer to the
change, and we are busy in marking the
agreement
between objects as they rise before us,
and our previous imaginations. Thus it was
with me. My palpitations increased as I drew
near the house to which I had been directed,
and I could scarcely govern my emotions
sufficiently
to inquire of the servant who
appeared
to my summons, for Mrs. Howard.
I was ushered into a lighted parlour, and
presently a lady entered. She bore no marks
of having passed the middle age, and her
countenance
exhibited the union of fortitude and
sweetness. Her air was full of dignity and
condescension. Methought I wanted no other
assurance but that which the sight of her
conveyed
,
that this was the wife of my friend.
I was thrown, by her entrance, into some
confusion, and was at a loss in what manner
to announce myself. The moment she caught
a distinct glance of my figure, her features
expanded
into a smile, and offering her hand,
she exclaimed....Ahah! This, without doubt,
is the young friend whom we have so anxiously
looked for. Your name is Edward Hartley,
K
and as such I welcome you, with the
tenderness
of a mother, to this home. Turning to
a servant who followed her, she continued, call
Clara hither. Tell her that a friend has
arrived
.
Before I had time to comment on this abrupt
reception, the door was again opened. A
nymph, robed with the most graceful simplicity,
entered, and advancing towards me, offered
me her hand....Here, said the elder lady, is
the son and brother whom Mr. Howard
promised
to procure for us. Welcome him, my
girl, as such.
Lifting her eyes from the floor, and casting
on me bashful but affectionate looks, the young
lady said, in an half-whisper, he is truly
welcome
...and
again offered the hand which,
confounded
and embarrassed as I at first was, I
had declined to accept. Now, however, I was
less backward.
An unaffected and sprightly conversation
followed, that tended to banish those timidities
which were too apparent in my deportment.
Mrs. Howard entered into a gay and almost
humorous description of my person, such as
she had received before my arrival, and
remarked
the differences between the picture
and the original, intermingling questions,
which, compelling me to open my lips in
answer
to them, helped me to get rid of my
aukwardness. Presently supper was prepared,
and dispatched with the utmost cheerfulness.
My astonishment and rapture were
unspeakable
.
Such condescension and familiarity,
surpassing all my fondest imaginations, from
beings invested with such dazzling superiority,
almost intoxicated my senses. My answers
were disadvantageous to myself, for they were
made in such a tumult and delirium of
emotions
,
that they could not fail of being
incoherent
or silly.
Gradually these raptures subsided, and I
acted and spoke with more sobriety and
confidence
.
I had leisure also to survey the
features
of my friends. Seated at opposite sides
of the table, with lights above and around us,
every lineament and gesture were distinctly
seen. It was difficult to say which person was
the most lovely. The bloom and glossiness
of youth had, indeed, disappeared in the elder,
but the ruddy tints and the smoothness of
health, joined to the most pathetic and
intelligent
expression, set the mother on a level, even
in personal attractions, with the daughter. No
music was ever more thrilling than the tones
of Clara. They sunk, deeply, into my heart,
while her eyes, casually turned on me, and
beaming with complacency, contributed still
more to enchant me.
In a few days, the effects of novelty
gradually
disappearing, I began to find myself at
home. Mr. Howard's arrival, and the
cordiality
of his behaviour, contributed still more
to place me at ease. Those employments he
designed for me, now occurred. They
generally
engrossed the half of each day. They
were light, dispatched without toil, or anxiety,
and conduced, in innumerable ways, to my
pleasure and improvement. They introduced
me to men of different professions and
characters
,
called forth my ingenuity and
knowledge
,
and supplied powerful incitements to
new studies and inquiries.
At noon, the day's business was usually
dismissed, and the afternoon and evening were
devoted to intellectual and social occupations.
These were generally partaken by the ladies,
and visits were received and paid so rarely, as
to form no interruption to domestic pleasures.
Collected round the fire, and busied in music
or books, or discourse, the hours flew away
with unheeded rapidity. The contrast which
this scene bore to my past life, perpetually
recurred
to my reflections, and added new and
inexpressible charms to that security and
elegance
by which I was at present surrounded.
Clara was the companion of my serious
and my sportive hours. I found, in her
character
,
simplicity and tenderness, united to
powerful intellects. The name of children
was often conferred upon us by my friend and
his wife; all advances to familiarity and
confidence
between us were encouraged; our little
plans of walking or studying together were
sanctioned by smiles of approbation, and their
happiness was evidently imperfect while ours
was suspended or postponed.
In this intercourse, there was nothing to
hinder the growth of that sentiment, which is
so congenial with virtuous and youthful
bosoms
.
My chief delight was in sharing the
society and performing offices of kindness for
Clara, and this delight the frankness of her
nature readily shewed to be mutual. Love
K 2
was not avowed or solicited, and did not
frequently
recur, in an undisguised shape, to my
thoughts. My desires seemed to be limited
to her presence, and to participating her
occupations
and amusements. Satisfied in like
manner with this, no marks of impatience or
anxiety were ever betrayed by her, but in my
absence.
The fulness of content which I now
experienced
,
did not totally exclude the
remembrance
of Mary. I had heard and seen nothing
of Morton since my departure from Hatfield.
The only way of accounting for this, was to
suppose that Mary and he had met, and that
the former, persuaded of the equity of his
claim, had resigned to him the money which
he had remitted to her brother.
The silence which she had observed,
involved
me in the deepest perplexity. I spared
no pains to discover Mrs. Valentine's
residence
,
but my pains were fruitless. My
inquiries
rendered it certain that, at least, no
such person resided in New-York.
Thus occupied, the winter passed away.
On a mild, but blustering evening in March,
I happened to be walking, in company with
Clara, on the battery. I chanced, after some
time, to spy before me, coming in an opposite
direction, the man whose fate had engaged so
much of my attention. It was Morton himself.
On seeing me, he betrayed much satisfaction,
but no surprise. We greeted each other
affectionately
.
Observing that he eyed my
companion
with particular earnestness, I introduced
him to her.
This meeting was highly desirable, as I
hoped to collect from it an explication of what
had hitherto been a source of perplexity. I
likewise marked a cheerfulnes in my friend's
deportment, which shewed that some
favourable
change had taken place. He seemed no
less anxious than I for a confidential interview;
and an appointment of a meeting on the same
evening was accordingly made.
Having conducted Clara home, I hastened
to the place appointed. I was forthwith
ushered
into a parlour, where Morton was found in
company with a lady of graceful and pensive
mein, with a smiling babe in her arms, to whom
he introduced me as to his wife. This
incident
confirmed my favourable prognostics, and
I waited, with impatience, till the lady's
departure
removed all constraint from our
conversation
.
In a short time, she left us alone. I
congratulate
you, said I, on your reunion with
your family, but cannot help expressing my
surprise
that you never favoured me with a second
visit, or gave me any intelligence of your good
fortune.
He apologized for his neglect, by saying,
that the arrival of his wife and daughter, in
New-York, obliged him, shortly after our
interview
,
to hasten to this city, where
successive
engagements had detained him till now.
He was, nevertheless, extremely desirous of a
meeting, and intended, as soon as pleasant
weather should return, to go to Hatfield, on
purpose to see me. This meeting, however,
had fortunately occurred to preclude the
necessity
of that journey. He then inquired
into the health of miss Wilmot, and her
present
situation. I was anxious to see her, he
continued, on account of that affair, on which
we conversed at our last meeting. As her
brother's friend, I was, likewise, desirous of
seeing her, and tendering her any service in
my power, but when taking measures to bring
about an interview, I received a letter from
my wife, who, to my infinite surprise and
satisfaction
,
had embarked for America, and
arrived safely at New-York. My eagerness
to see my family, made me postpone this
interview
for the present, and one engagement has
since so rapidly succeeded another, that I have
never been at leisure to execute this design.
What, said I, has no meeting taken place
between Mary Wilmot and you? Has she not
restored the money you claimed?
Surely, replied he, you cannot be ignorant
that I have never received it. I doubted
whether
I ought to receive it, even if my title were
good. It was chiefly to become acquainted
with her, that I looked for her, and my good
fortune has since enabled me to dispense with
any thing else. The property, left by her
brother
,
may rightfully belong to her,
notwithstanding
present appearances. At any rate,
her possession shall be unmolested by me.
He then proceeded to inform me, that his
wife's parents being deceived by his long
silence
,
and the intelligence of his shipwreck,
into the opinion of his death, had relented, and
settled an independent and liberal pension on
their daughter, on condition of her chusing
some abode at a distance from them. She
proposed to retire, with her child, to some
neat and rural abode in Cornwall, and was on
the point of executing this design, when letters
were received from her husband, at Algiers,
which assured her of his safety, and requested
her to embark for America, where it was his
intention to meet her. She had instantly
changed her plans, and selling her annuity on
good terms, had transported herself and her
property to New-York, were her husband
being
apprised of her arrival, hastened to join
her.
Thus, continued Morton, you have, in my
destiny, a striking instance of the folly of
despair
.
My shipwreck, and my long absence,
in circumstances which hindered all
intercourse
between me and my family, were the
most propitious events that could have
happened
.
Nothing but the belief of my death,
and the consequent distresses of my wife,
could have softened the animosity of her
parents
.
Her disobedience, they though, had
been amply punished, and fate having taken
from me, the power of receiving any
advantage
from their gift, they consented to make
her future life secure, at least, from want.
It was also lucky, that their returning
affection stopped just where it did. Their
resentment
was still so powerful as to make
them refuse to see her, and to annex to their
gift, the stern condition of residing at a
distance
from them. Hence she was enabled to
embark for America, without detecting their
mistake, as to my death. They carefully shut
their ears against all intelligence of her
condition
,
whether direct or indirect, and will
probably pass their lives in ignorance of that,
which, if known, would only revive their
upbraidings
and regrets.
I am not sorry for the hardships I have
indured. They are not unpleasing to
remembrance
,
and serve to brighten and endear the
enjoyments of my present state, by contrast
with former sufferings. I have enough for the
kind of life which I prefer to all others, and
have no desire to enlarge my stock.
Meanwhile
,
I am anxious for the welfare of miss
Wilmot
,
and shall rejoice in having been, though
undesignedly, the means of her prosperity.
I heard, in Philadelphia, that a marriage
was on foot between her and you. I flattered
myself, when I met you this evening, that
your companion was she, and secretly
congratulated
you on the possession of so much
gracefulness and beauty. In this, it seems, I
was partly mistaken. This is a person very
different from Mary Wilmot; but a friend,
whom I met, shortly after parting from you,
and to whom I described her, assured me that
this was the object of your choice. Pray, what
has become of miss Wilmot?
I frankly confessed to him, my ignorance
of her condition, and related what had
formerly
been the relation between her and us. I
expressed my surprise at finding that she was
still in possession of the money, after the
representations
I had made; and at the silence she
had so long observed.
When I recollected in what manner, and in
whose company, she had left Abingdon, I
could not shut out some doubts, as to her
integrity
.
She was, indeed, mistress of her own
actions, and Sedley was not unworthy of her
choice; but her neglect of my letter, and her
keeping this money, were suspicious
accompanyments
.
This belief was too painful, to
attain my ready acquiescence, and I
occasionally
consoled myself, by imagining her
conduct
to proceed from some misapprehension,
on the one or other part. Mrs. Valentine's
reputation was unspotted, and under her
guardianship
,
it was scarcely possible for any injury
to approach my friend's person or morals.
My anxiety to discover the truth, was now
increased. After being so long accustomed
to partake her cares, and watch over her safety,
I could not endure this profound ignorance.
I was even uncertain, as to her existence. It
was impossible, but that my friendship would
be of some benefit. My sympathy could not
fail to alleviate her sorrow, or enhance her
prosperity.
But what means had I of removing this
painful obscurity. I knew not which way to
look for her. My discoveries must be wholly
fortuitous.
Notwithstanding my own enjoyments, I
allowed the image of Mary Wilmot to intrude
into my thoughts too frequently. Some change
in my temper was discerned by Clara, and she
inquired into the cause. At first, I was
deterred
L
by indefinite scruples, from unfolding
the cause, but some reflection shewed me that
I was wrong, in so long concealing from her,
a transaction of this moment. I, therefore,
seized a favourable opportunity, and recounted
all the incidents of my life, connected with this
poor fugitive.
When I began, however, I was not aware
of the embarrassment which I was preparing to
suffer and inflict. We used to sit up much
longer than our friends, and after they had
retired to repose, taking their places on the
sofa, allowed the embers to die gradually away,
while we poured forth, unrestrained, the
effusions
of the moment. It was on one of these
occasions that, after a short preface, I began
my story. I detailed the origin of my
intercourse
with miss Wilmot, the discovery of her
passion for me, the contest between that
passion
and my indifference on one side, and the
claims and solicitations of Sedley on the other.
I was listened to with the deepest emotion.
Curiosity enabled her to stifle it for some time;
but when I came to the events of Wilmot's
death, the discovery of his property, and the
consequent agreement to marry, she was able
to endure the recital no longer. She burst into
tears, and articulated with difficulty: Enough,
my friend, I know the rest. I know what you
would say. Your melancholy is explained,
and I see that my fate is fixed in eternal
misery
.
I was at once shocked, astonished, and
delighted
,
by the discovery which was thus made,
and made haste, by recounting subsequent
transactions, to correct her error. She did
not draw the same inferences from the flight
and silence of the girl, or drew them with less
confidence than I. She was not consoled by
my avowals of passion for herself, and declared
that she considered my previous contract as
inviolable. Nothing could absolve me from it,
but the absolute renunciation of miss Wilmot
herself.
I considered the disappearance and silence
of Mary, as a sufficient renunciation of her
claims, and once more dwelt upon the scruples
and objections which she had formerly raised
to our alliance; which had been, imperfectly,
and for a time, removed by the death of her
brother, and which, Morton's arrival, had
restored
to their original strength. Some regard,
likewise, was due to my own felicity, and to
that of one whose happiness deserved to be as
zealously promoted as that of the fugitive. It
was true, that I had tendered vows to miss
Wilmot, which my understanding, and not my
heart; which gratitude, and not affection, had
dictated. This tender, in the circumstances in
which I was then placed, was necessary and
proper; but these circumstances had now
changed. My offer had been tacitly rejected.
Not only my love, but my friendship, had been
slighted and despised. My affections had
never
been devoted to another, and the sacrifice
of inclination was limited to myself. This
indifference, however, existed no more. It was
supplanted by a genuine and ardent attachment
for one in all respects more worthy. I was
willing to hope that this attachment was
mutual
.
Fortune and her parents, and her own
heart, were all propitious to my love; and to
stifle and thwart it for the sake of one, who had
abjured my society and my friendship; who
renounced my proffered hand, and cancelled
all my promises; who had possibly made
herself
unworthy of my esteem, by the forfeiture
of honour itself, or more probably had given
up all her claims on my justice and compassion,
by accepting another, would be, in the highest
degree, absurd and unjustifiable.
These arguments wrought no effect upon
Clara. It was her duty, she answered, to
contend
with selfish regards, and to judge of the
feelings of others by her own. Whatever
reluctance she might experience in resigning
me to another, in whatever degree she might
thwart the wishes and schemes of her parents,
it was her duty to resign me, and she should
derive more satisfaction from disinterested,
than from selfish conduct. She would not
attempt to disguise her feelings and wishes,
and extenuate the sacrifice she was called on
to make, but she had no doubt as to what was
right, and her resolution to adhere to it would
be immovable.
This resolution, and this inflexibility, were
wholly unexpected. I was astonished and
mortified, and having exhausted all my
arguments
in vain, gave way to some degree of
acrimony and complaint, as if I were
capriciously
treated. At one time, I had thoughts
of calling her parents to my aid, and
explaining
to them my situation with regard to Mary,
L 2
and soliciting them to exert their authority in
my behalf with Clara.
A deep and incurable sadness now
appeared
in my friend, and strong, though
unostentatious
proofs were daily afforded, that an
exquisite sense of justice had dictated her
deportment, and that she had laid upon
herself
a task to which her fortitude was scarcely
equal. It appeared to me the highest cruelty
to aggravate the difficulty of this task, by
enlisting
against her those whose authority she
most revered, and whose happiness she was
most desirous of promoting.
My eagerness to trace miss Wilmost to
her retreat, to find out her condition, and make
her, if possible, my advocate with Clara, was
increased by this unhappy resolution. I began
to meditate anew upon the best means of
effecting
this. I blamed myself for having so long
failed to employ all the means in my power,
and resolved to begin my search without
delay. Clara, whose conclusions respecting
miss Wilmot's motives were far more
charitable
than mine, was no less earnest in
inciting
me to this pursuit. She believed miss
Wilmot's conduct to have been consistent with
integrity, that it flowed from a generous but
erroneous self-denial, and that the
re-establishment
of intercourse between us, would
terminate in the happiness of both.
The incidents formerly related, had made
it certain that miss Wilmot had flown away in
company with Sedley. Sedley's patrimony
and fixed abode were in Virginia. There, it
was most probable, that he and the fugitive
would be found. There, at least, should
Sedley
have abandoned his ancient residence,
was it most likely that the means of tracing
his footsteps, would be found. Mary, if not
at present in his company, or in that of his
sister, had not perhaps concealed her asylum
from them, and might be discovered by their
means. Fortunately, Mr. Howard had
engagements
at Richmond which would shortly
require his own presence, or that of one in
whom he could confide. He had mentioned
this necessity in my presence in such a way as
shewed that he would not be unwilling to
transfer his business to me. Hitherto I had
been unwilling to relinquish my present
situation
;
but now I begged to be entrusted with
his commission, as it agreed with my own
projects.
In a few days I set out upon this journey.
Passing, necessarily, at no great distance from
Hatfield, I took that opportunity of visiting
my uncle and sisters. You may imagine my
surprise on finding, at my uncle's house, a
letter for me, from Mary, which had arrived
there just after my departure, in the
preceding
autumn, and had lain, during the whole
winter, neglected and forgotten, in a drawer.
This letter was worthy of my friend's
generous and indignant spirit, and fully
accounted
for her flight from Abingdon. She
was determined to separate herself from me,
to die in some obscure recess, whither I
should never be able to trace her, and thus to
remove every obstacle in the way of my
pretentions
to one, younger, lovlier and richer
than herself. In this letter was enclosed an
order for the money, which, as I had taught
her too hastily to believe, belonged to
another
.
I believe you know that I am not a selfish
or unfeeling wretch. What but the deepest
regret, could I feel at the ignorance in which I
had so long been kept of her destiny; what, but
vehement impatience to discover the place of
her retreat, and persuade her to accept my
vows, or, at least, to take back the money to
which Morton's title was not yet proved,
which would save her at least from the
horrors
of that penury she was so little qualified
to endure, and to which, for more than six
inclement months, she had been, through
unhappy
misapprehension, subjected?
In this mood I hastened to this city, but
my heroism quickly evaporated. I felt no
abatement of my eagerness to benefit the
unhappy
fugitive, by finding her; counselling
her; consoling her; repossessing her of the
means of easy, if not of affluent subsistence;
but more than this I felt myself incapable of
offering. I knew full well, that, when
acquainted
with the whole truth, she never
would accept me as hers; but I despaired of
gaining any thing with respect to Clara, by
that rejection. I despaired of ever lighting
again on miss Wilmot. Besides, my pride
was piqued and wounded by resolutions that
appeared to me absurd; to arise from
prejudiced
views and a narrow heart; from
unreasonable
regards bestowed upon one, of whose
merits she had no direct knowledge, and
blamable
indifference to another whom she had
abundant reason to love.
The letters that passed between us only
tended to convince me that she was
implacable
,
and I left the city for Virginia with a
secret determination of never returning. I
resolved to solicit Mr. Howard's permission
to accompany some surveyors employed by
him, who were to pass immediately into the
western country. By this means, I hoped to
shake off fetters that were now become badges
of misery and ignominy.
The wisdom of man, when employed upon
the future, is incessantly taught its own
weakness
.
Had an angel whispered me, as I
mounted the stage for Baltimore, that I should
go no further on that journey than Schuylkill,
and that, without any new argument or effort
on my part, Clara would, of her own accord,
call me back to her and to happiness, I should
no doubt have discredited the intimation.
Yet such was the event.
In order to rescue a drowning passenger,
I leaped into the river. The weather being
bleak and unwholesome, I was seized, shortly
after my coming out, with a fever, which
reduced
me, in a very few days, to the brink of
the grave. Now was the solicitude of my
Clara awakened. When in danger of losing
me forever, she discovered the weakness of
her scruples, and effectually recalled me to
life, by entreating me to live for her sake.
I have not yet perfectly recovered my
usual health. I am unfit for business or for
travelling; and standing in need of some
amusement which will relieve, without
fatiguing
my attention, I called to mind your
claims on me, and determined to give you the
account you desired.
When I received your letter, informing
me of your design to meet me in New-York,
I was utterly dispirited and miserable. My
design of coming southward, I knew, would
prevent an immediate meeting with you, and
as I had then conceived the project of a
journey
to the western waters, I imagined that
we should never have another meeting.
Now, my friend, my prospects are brighter,
and I hope to greet you the moment of your
arrival in New-York. I shall go thither as
soon as I am able. I shall never repose till my
happiness with Clara is put beyond the power
of man to defeat.
But, alas! what has become of Mary
Wilmot
.
Heaven grant that she be safe. While
unacquainted with her destiny, my happiness
will never be complete; day and night I
torment
myself with fruitless conjectures about
her. Yet she went away with Sedley, a man
of honour, and her lover, and with his sister,
whose integrity cannot be questioned. With
these she cannot be in danger, or in poverty.
This reflection consoles me.
I long to see you, my friend. I hope to be
of some service to you. You will see, by this
long detail, that fortune has been kind to me.
Indeed, when I take a view of the events of
the last year, I cannot find language for my
wonder. My blessings are so numerous and
exorbitant, my merits so slender.
I wish thee patience to carry thee to the
end of this long letter.
Adieu.

LETTER XIV.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,
April
28.
Why
don't you come home, my love?
Are you not quite well? Tell me when; the
day, the hour, when I may expect you. I will
put new elegance into my garb; new health
into my cheeks; new light; new love; new
joy into my eyes, against that happy hour.
Would to heaven I were with you. I
represented
to my father what an excellent nurse
I should prove, but he would not suffer me to
accompany him. I have a good mind to steal
away to you, even now; but are you not
already
quite well? Yes, you are; or, very soon
will be. Time and care are all that are required
to make you so.
But, poor Mary....Does not your heart, my
Edward, bleed for poor Mary? Can I rob her
of so precious a good; bereave her of the gem
of which she has so long been in secure
possession
?
Can I riot in bliss, and deck myself in
bridal
ornaments, while she lives pining in
dreary
solitude, carrying to the grave an heart
broken by the contumelies of the world; the
horrors of indigence and neglect; and chiefly
by the desertion of him on whom she doated?
Do I not know what it is to love? Cannot I
easily imagine what it is to bear about an
unrequited
passion? Have I not known, from
infancy, the pleasures of affluence and homage?
Cannot I conceive the mortifications to one
thus bred up, of poverty and labour? Indeed,
my friend, I conceive them so justly, that till
Mary Wilmot is discovered, and is either
been found happy, or been made happy, no
selfish gratification, whatever, can insure my
peace.
I should not thus be deeply interested for
a mere stranger. I know your Mary. Your
details, full of honesty and candour, have made
me thoroughly acquainted with her. You have
given me, in the picture of her life, the amplest
picture of an human being that I ever was
allowed
to survey. Her virtue, my friend, has
been tried. Not without foibles, she is, for
which she was indebted to her education; but
her signal excellence lies in having, in spite of
a most pernicious education, so few faults.
My friend, you
must
find her. As you
value my happiness, you
must
. Nay, as you
value my love. If your zeal did not lead you
to move heaven and earth in her cause, you
would be, in my eyes, a wretch. Nay, if you
did not....But I am straying from the path. I
must not think of her, lest my admiration and
my pity for her get the better of my love for
you.
Pray, make haste and be well, that you
make as happy as she can be, your fond, your
devoted
Clara
.

LETTER XV.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
April
30.
I will
never yield to you, my friend,
in zeal for one whom I reverence and love so
much as Mary Wilmot. How I adore your
generous, your noble spirit. While limited
to the real good of that girl; while zealous
to confer happiness on her, without an
equivalent
injury to others, I applaud, and will
strive to emulate your generosity....
An incident has just occurred, that seems
to promise some intelligence concerning her.
It has made me very uneasy. I am afraid she
is not happy. I am afraid she is....is not happy;
I mean, I fear she is....unhappy. But I know
not what I would say. I am bewildered....by
my terrors on her account. Let me tell you
what I have heard. Judge for yourself.
Unhappy
the hour that I wrote the last letter from
Hatfield. Yet, who could imagine that the
intelligence
contained in it would suggest so
rash, so precipitate a flight!
This Sedley, whose fidelity, whose honour
I have so often applauded, is, I am afraid, a
miscreant; a villain. Mary....the very thought
takes away my breath....is, I fear, a lost,
undone
creature....
Yet how? Such a fall surely was impossible.
Mary Wilmot, whose whole life has been
exposed
to my view; whom I have seen in the
most unguarded moments; whose indifference
to Sedley; whose unconquerable aversion to
his most honourable and flattering offers, I
have so often witnessed, could not forget
herself
;
her dignity. I will not believe it.
But what am I saying? Let me recollect
myself, and lay, distinctly, before you, the
cause of my apprehensions.
This morning being disengaged, and the
air mild, instead of going on with this letter,
I stole abroad to enjoy the sweet breath of
heaven. My feet carried me, unaware, to the
door of the house in which I formerly passed
a servitude of three years. My old master,
Watkins, of time-measuring memory, has
been some time dead. The widow turned
her stock into revenue, and now lives at her
ease. Though not eminently good, she is far
from being a bad woman. She never behaved
otherwise than kindly to Neddy Sobersides,
as she used to call me, and I feel somewhat
like gratitude, which would not let me pass
the door. So I called, to see the old dame.
I found her by a close-stove, in the parlour,
knitting a blue stocking.... Lack a day, said she,
why as I's a living soul, this is our Ned.
After the usual congratulations and
inquiries
were made, she proceeded: Why, what
a fine story is this, Neddy, that we hear of
you? Why, they say you've grown a rich man's
son, and are going to be married to a fine rich,
great lady, from some other country.
I avoided a direct answer. She continued:
Ah! dear me, we all thought you were going
to be married to poor Molly Wilmot, the
mantua-maker. Nay, for the matter o' that,
my poor dear man, I remember, said, as how,
that if so be, we'd wait a year or so, we should
see things turn up so, that you and her should
be married already; at that time; and that, I
remember, was just as your time was up. But
Molly, (with a very significant air this was
said) has carried her goods to a much worse
market it seems.
Why, know you any thing of miss
Wilmot
?
Why, I don't know but as I does. I doesn't
know much to her advantage though, you
may depend, Neddy.
I was startled. What do you know of her?
Tell me, I beseech you, all you know?
Why, I don't know much, not I; but
Peggy
,
my nurse, said something or other about
her, yesterday. She drank tea with me....
Pray, said I, impatiently, what said your
nurse of miss Wilmot?
Why, I don't know as I ought to tell.... But
I will not tease you, Clara, as I was tired with
the jargon of the old woman. I will give you
the sum of her intelligence in my own words.
The nurse had lately been in the family of
Mr. Kalm, of Germantown....between which
and that of Mrs. Valentine, I have long known
that much intimacy subsisted. Sedley, it
seems, passed through this city about three
weeks ago, and spent a day at Mr. Kalm's.
At dinner, when the nurse was present, the
conversation turned upon the marriage of
Sedley
,
which, it seems, was just concerted with
the daughter of a wealthy family in Virginia.
The lady's name was mentioned, but the nurse
forgot it.
Mrs. Kalm, who is noted for the freedom
of her discourse, reminded Mr. Sedley of
the mantua-maker who eloped with him from
Abingdon last autumn, and jestingly inquired
into her present condition. Sedley dealt in
hints and innuendoes, which imported that he
was on as good terms with Molly Wilmot as
he desired to be; that all his wishes, with
respect
to her, were now accomplished; that she
knew her own interest too well to allow any
obstruction to his marriage to come from her;
that she would speedily resume her customary
station in society, as the
cause
of her present
disappearance
was likely to be soon removed.
I will not torment you or myself, by
dwelling
on further particulars. My informant
was deplorably defective in the means of
imparting
any clear and consistent meaning. An
hour was employed in recollecting facts and
answering questions, all which, taken together,
imported nothing less than that an improper
connection had, for some months, subsisted
between Sedley and my friend; a connection
of such a nature as was consistent with his
marriage
with another.
Comfort me; counsel me, my angel. I
gathered
from the beldame's tale, the probability
at least, that miss Wilmot was still in this city.
Shall I seek her? shall I.... Tell me, in short,
what I must believe? what I shall do?

LETTER XVI.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,

Ah
! my friend! art thou so easily
misled
?
Does slander find in thee a dupe of her
most silly and extravagant contrivances? An
old nurse's envious and incoherent tale! At
second hand, too! With all the deductions and
embellishments which must cleave to every
story, as it passes through the imagination of
two gossips.
Art thou not ashamed of thyself, Edward?
To impute black pollution to the heart, whose
fortitude, whose purity, so many years of trial
have attested, on the authority of a crazy
beldame
,
repeating the malignant inferences, and
embellishing the stupid hints of an old nurse.
Sedley is a villain and a slanderer. Had
I
been
present when he thought proper to blast the
fame of the innocent and absent, I should not
have controuled my indignation. I should
have cast the furious
lie
in his teeth.
And is it possible, my friend, that on such
evidence as this, you build your belief that
Mary has become an abandoned creature! I
am ashamed of such credulity. She is in the
same city, you believe, yet sit idly in your
chamber, lamenting that depravity which exists
only in your fancy, and finding in such absurd
and groundless suspicions, a reason for
withholding
that property which, whether she be
vile as dirt, or bright as heaven, is equally her
right.
Seek her out this moment. Never rest till
you have found her. Restore to her, her own
property; tender her your counsel; your aid.
Mention me to her as one extremely anxious
to cultivate her good opinion, and enjoy her
friendship. Do this, Edward, instantly, I
exhort
,
I intreat, I command you; and let me
know the result?

LETTER XVII.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
May
4.
I have
just returned from Germantown,
and find your letter on my table. Thank
heaven
,
I have not merited all your rebukes. That
anxiety to ascertain the truth, and that
unwillingness
to trust to such witnesses as gossips
and nurses, which you think I ought to feel, I
really have felt. My last was written in the
first tumult of my thoughts. The moment I
laid down the pen, and began more
deliberately
to reflect upon the subject, doubts and
hopes thronged into my imagination. I
resolved
to bend every nerve to discover the
retreat of Mary, and ascertain her true
situation
.
As Sedley was so well known to Mrs.
Kalm, I resolved to visit that lady. I had no
acquaintance with her, but I overlooked the
impropriety of my application, and set out
immediately
to Germantown.
Being admitted to an apartment in which
I found that lady alone, I introduced myself
in some confused way, I scarcely know how,
and inquired whether she knew the person
whom Sedley was about to marry, and
whether
she could afford me any information of
the place where Mary Wilmot was likely to be
found.
She answered, with great civility, that
Sedley's
sister was her dear friend; that Mrs.
Valentine resided, at this time, in
New-England
;
that her brother, passing lately through
this city, in order to join her, had spent part
of a day with Mr. Kalm; that Sedley had given
his friends leave to consider him as upon the
eve of marriage, but had not thought proper to
disclose to them the name and family of the
lady; that they were totally in the dark on both
these heads, but were inclined to believe that
she was a woman of Boston; that as to Mary
Wilmot, she knew nothing of her or her affairs.
Mrs. Kalm's curiosity was somewhat
excited
by the singularity of my introduction,
and she soon became inquisitive in her turn.
Encouraged by her frank and communicative
humour, I ventured to explain, unreservedly,
the motive of my inquiries. She smiled at
the impression which the tale of the nurse and
gossip had made on my fears.
Your uneasiness, said she, was without any
foundation. Perhaps we might have jestingly
talked of Miss Wilmot's elopement with
Sedley
,
because his pretensions to that girl are
pretty well known; but I am not now to be told
that your friend was, on that journey, the
companion
,
not of the brother, but the sister, and
that Miss Wilmot's reputation and virtue,
could not be safer under her own guardianship
than under Mrs. Valentine's. Besides, there
is not a man in the world, of stricter principles
than Sedley. What you have heard, or
something
like it, might actually have passed at that
dinner, but no one could have construed it in
a way injurious to Sedley or your friend, but
who was wholly unacquainted with the parties,
or who was very hungry after slander.
Sedley certainly talked as if he knew more
of Miss Wilmot than he just then thought fit
to disclose. What he said was accompanied
with nods and smiles of some significance;
but I should just as readily have put an evil
construction on his hints, had he been talking
of his own sister. All the world knows that
a woman of merit would be sure to receive
from Sedley, exactly the treatment which an
affectionate brother would be disposed to give.
As to Miss Wilmot's
disappearance
, I
never
knew, till now, there was any thing
mysterious
or suspicious in her conduct. It is true,
she left her former residence, but, considering
in whose company she left it, and the privacy
and solitude in which she had previously lived,
I was inclined to think she had risen into sight
and notice, and instead of retiring from
observation
,
had come forth more conspicuously
than ever. This was necessarily the case, if
she lived, or associated, as she probably did,
with Mrs. Valentine.
When Sedley talked of the cause of her
journey being removed, and her reassuming
her station among us, I confess he was
unintelligible
to me. I knew of no cause for her
N 2
journey, but her own pleasure, and perhaps,
Mrs. Valentine's intreaties. The construction
which a casual hearer seems to have put upon
his words, was foolish and preposterous.
Indeed
,
it is highly offensive to me, since it
presupposed
that I could patiently hear any one
utter such insinuations at my table.
Mrs. Kalm seemed much hurt at the
misapprehensions
of the nurse, and was very
earnest in vindicating Sedley's innocence. She
bore testimony to the undeviating and
exemplary
propriety of Miss Wilmot's conduct, ever
since it had been within the reach of her
observation
.
Thou wilt imagine, Clara, with what
unspeakable
delight I listened to her eulogy. I
was astonished at my own folly, in drawing
such extravagant conclusions. My own heart
pleads guilty to thy charges of credulity and
precipitation, but I hope I shall not be so grossly
or so easily deceived a second time.
Mrs. Kalm could give me no account of
the present situation of my friend, but she gave
me Mrs. Valentine's address. From her, no
doubt, I shall be able to obtain all the
information
I want. I was a stupid wretch, not
sooner to inquire among that lady's numerous
friends, where she was to be found. I will
write to her immediately.
Congratulate me, my beloved, on this
opening
of brighter prospects for one who is equally
and deservedly dear to both of us. Unless
you make haste to write, I shall receive your
congratulations in person, for I feel myself,
already, well enough to travel, in your
company
,
to the world's end. Adieu.

LETTER XVIII.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
May

.
Though
I am so soon to be with you,
and have received no answer to my last, yet I
cannot be alone in my chamber, and be within
reach of pen and paper, without snatching
them up and talking to my friend thus. This
is a mode of conversing I would willingly
exchange
for the more lively and congenial
intercourse
of eyes and lips, but 'tis better than
total silence.
What are you doing now? Busy, I
suppose
,
in turning over the leaves of some book.
Some painter of manners or of nature is before
you. Some dramatist, or poet, or historian,
furnishes you with occupation. The day, here,
is celestially benigh. Such, only, as our
climate
can know. It is not less splendid and
serene with you. So, you have strolled into
that field, which is not excelled, for the
grandeur
of its scenery, the balsamic and reviving
virtue of its breezes, its commodiousness of
situation, for the purpose of relieving those
condemned to a city life, by any field on this
globe. The batttery....what a preposterous
name! Yet not the only instance of a mound,
serving at once the double purpose of pleasure
and defence. Did you not say the
bulwarks
of Paris were pleasure-walks? You have been
in Sicily and Provence. Did you ever meet
with sun, sky, and water, more magnificent,
and air more bland, than you are
now
contemplating
and breathing? For methinks I see that
lovely form gliding along the green, or fixed,
in musing posture, at the rails, and listening to
the ripling of the waters.
Perhaps, some duty keeps you at home.
You expect a visitant; are seated at your toilet;
adding all the inchantments of drapery; the
brilliant hues and the flowing train of muslin,
to a form whose excellence it is to be
beautiful
when unadorned, and yet to gain from every
ornament, new beauty.
What a rare lot is yours, Clara! One of
the most fortunate of women art thou. Wealth,
affluence, is yours; but wealth is only the means
of every kind of happiness; it is not happiness
itself. But you have not only the tools, but
the inclination and ability to use them. In no
hands could riches be placed so as to produce
more felicity to the possessor, and to those
within reach of her munificence.
Which is the most unerring touchstone of
merit, poverty or riches? Ingeniously to
supply
the place, or gracefully to endure the want
of riches, is the privilege of great minds. To
retain humility and probity, in spite of riches,
and to effect the highest good of ourselves and
others, by the use of them, is the privilege of
minds still greater. The last privilege is
Clara's. The first....vanity has sometimes
said....no matter what. It was, indeed, vanity
that said it. Vanity, that is now humbled into
wisdom and self-distrust. So far from bearing
poverty with dignity, I cannot justly call my
former situation by that name, and was far
from bearing even the moderate privations of
that state with fortitude.
And are, indeed, these privations forever
at an end? Is the harder test of wisdom, the
true use of riches, now to be imposed upon
me? It is. Clara Howard, and all that she
inherits, will be mine. I ought to tremble for
the consequences of exposure to such
temptations
.
And, if I stood alone, I
should
tremble;
but, in reality, whatever is your, or your father's
gift, is not mine. Your power over it shall ever
be unlimited and uncontrouled by me, and this,
not more from the equity of your claim to the
sole power, than from the absolute rectitude
with which that power will be exercised by
you. Had I millions of my own acquiring,
I should deem it no more than my duty to
resign
to you the employment of them.
Ah! my divine friend! I will be no more
than your agent; your almoner; one whose
aid may make charity less toilsome to you;
may free the pleasures of beneficence from
some of those pains by which they are usually
attended. I will go before you, plucking up
thorns, and removing asperities from the path
that you chuse. All my recompense shall be
the consciousness in whose service I labour,
and whose pleasures I enhance.
They tell us that ambition is natural to
man: that no possession is so pleasing as power
and command. I do not find it so. I would
fain be an universal benefactor. The power,
that office or riches confers, is requisite to this
end; but power in infirm hands, is productive
only of mischief. I who know my own frailty,
am therefore undesirous of power. So far
from wishing to rule others, it is my glory and
my boast to submit to one whom I deem
unerring
and divine. Clara's will is my law: her
pleasure the science that I study; her smiles
the reward that, next to an approving God,
my soul prizes most dearly.
Indeed, my friend, before you honour me
with your choice, you should contrive to exalt
me or lower yourself. Some
parity
there
ought to be between us. An angel in the
heavens
,
like thee, is not a fit companion for a
mere earth-worm, like
Hartlly

Ah
hah! give them to me. Two letters
at once. This is unexpected happiness.
Charming papers! Lie
there
and still the little
rebel, that will not allow me speech.
And thinkest thou my lips said this, as
my father threw thy letters into my lap? No
such thing. My heart was mutinous, 'tis true,
but no one present....there were many present
....was aware of its tumults, except, indeed,
my mother. Her observant eye saw what
was passing within. Or rather she guessed,
from the superscription, what I felt, and
therefore
,
considerately furnished me with an
excuse
for retiring.
Clara, my dear, I imagine your good
woman
has come. I think I saw her go down the
steps. My friends will excuse you for a
moment
.
I hastily withdrew; and
then
, Edward,
having
gained the friendly covert of my chamber,
I eagerly, rapturously, kissed and read thy
letters.
I thought it would prove a mere slander;
and yet I was uneasy. The mere possibility
of its truth, shocked and distressed me, more
than I can tell; but thy intelligence has not
only removed the disquiet which thy
foregoing
letter had produced, but, in reality, has
given me uncommon pleasure. I flatter
myself
that your letter to Mrs. Valentine will
receive a speedy and satisfactory answer.
Human life, Edward, is a motley scene.
Thou wilt not thank me for the novelty of that
remark, but the truth of it I think has received
new illustration in the little incidents on
which thy last letters have commented. Had
not the old nurse's tale incited thee to inquiry,
thou would'st not, at this moment, have been
in the way to gain any knowledge of poor
Mary. Had not thy sad prognostics filled me
with melancholy, my mother's attention would
not have been excited to the cause of my
uneasiness
.
I did not conceal from her the cause. I
made her pretty well acquainted with the
history
of Mary. She was deeply interested in
the story I told, and suggested many
inquiries
respecting her, which I had overlooked.
She has made me extremely anxious as to
some particulars, on which perhaps you can
give me the desired information.
Pray tell me what you know of the history
of her family before her father's leaving
Europe
.
Where was he born? Where lived he?
What profession did he follow? What know
you of the history of Mary's mother?
Excuse me for confining myself, at
present
,
to these inquiries. Tell me all you
know on this subject, and I will then acquaint
you with the motive of my inquisitiveness.
I shall expect to hear from you, on
Thursday
morning.
Adieu. Be careful of thyself, if thou
lovest
thy
Clara

O 2
LETTER XX.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
May
8.
I am
at a loss, dear girl, to account for
thy questions, but I will answer them to the
utmost of my power. The same questions
frequently occurred to me, in my intercourse
with the Wilmots. It was natural, you know,
to suppose that they had left relations in their
native country, with whom it might be of
some advantage to renew their intercourse.
Mary was ten years old, when her father
took up his abode in Delaware, but he had
been already five years in the country, so that,
you will easily perceive, she was not likely to
possess much personal knowledge of events
previous to their voyage. Her mother's
death happened just before their removal to
Wilmington. It appears to have been the
chief cause of that removal.
Your letter has put me on the task of
recollection
.
I am sorry that I am able to
collect
and arrange very few circumstances; such
as you demand. The Wilmots were either
very imperfectly acquainted with the history
of their parents, or were anxious to bury their
history in oblivion. The first was probably
the situation of the son, but I have often
suspected
,
from the contradictions and evasions
of which Mary was at different times guilty,
when this subject was talked of between us,
that the daughter pretended ignorance, for the
sake of avoiding the mortification of telling
the truth. When once urged pretty closely
on this head, she, indeed, told me, the
subject
was a painful one to her; that she knew
nothing of her European kindred which would
justify the searching them out; and that she
would hold herself obliged to me, if I never
recalled past events to her remembrance.
After
this injunction I was silent, but, in the
course of numberless conversations,
afterwards
,
hints were casually dropped, which
afforded me, now and then, a glimpse into
their family history.
When Mary spoke of her father, it was
always with reverence for his talents, gratitude
for his indulgence to her, and compassion for
that frailty of character, which made him seek
in dissipation, relief from sorrow on account
of the death of a wife whom he adored; and a
refuge, as she sometimes obscurely intimated,
from some calamity or humiliation, which
befel him in his native country.
My friend's heart always throbbed, and
her eyes were filled with tears, whenever her
mother was remembered. She took a
mournful
pleasure in describing her mother's person
and manners, in which, she was prone to
believe, all human excellence was comprized.
Her own melancholy temper and gloomy
destiny
,
she imagined to have descended to her
by inheritance, and she once allowed me to
collect from her discourse, that her mother had
died the victim of some early and heavy
disappointment
.
We were once, the winter before last,
conversing, by an evening fire, on that most
captivating topic, ourselves. Having said
something on my attachment to my country,
and especially to the hill-side where I first
drew breath, and inquired into her feelings
in relation to the same objects,
Alas! said she, I should be puzzled to say
to what country I belong. I am a German by
my father; English by my mother. I was
born at an hotel in Paris, I was nursed by a
woman of Nice, where I passed my infancy;
and my youth and womanhood, and probably
my whole life, belong to America. Now,
what is the country, Germany, England,
France, Italy or America, which I have a
right to call my own. The earliest object of
my recollection is the face of my nurse, who
accompanied us in all our wanderings, and
who died just before my father, on
Brandywine
.
The olives, the orange walks, and the
sea-shore scenery of Savoy, are still fresh in
my remembrance. Should I visit them again,
no doubt my feelings would be strongly
affected
,
but I never expect to visit them.
But your father's, your mother's natal spot,
would have some charms, methinks, to one of
your sensibility.
Some influence, no doubt, the
contemplation
would have, but no charms. Strange, if I
should ever have an opportunity of trying their
effect upon my feelings.
You are acquainted, then, with the
birthplace
of your father and mother.
Yes, I have heard them described so often,
and with such minuteness, that I should
recognize
them, I think, at any distance of time.
My father was born in the Grey-street, next
to the chapel of St. Anne, at Altona. My
mother
and family have subsisted, from the days of
William the Norman, at a spot, five miles
from Taunton, in Devonshire.
I was in hopes that these particulars were
preliminary to more interesting disclosures,
but my friend now changed the subject of
conversation
,
and would not be brought back to the
point I wished.
Mr. Wilmot was a man of liberal
education
and cultivated taste. This appears from
the representations of his daughter, and
likewise
from several books, which she preserved
by connivance of his creditors, and which are
enriched by many notes and memorandums in
her father's hand-writing. These betoken an
enlarged mind and extensive knowledge. She
has, likewise, a sort of journal, kept by him
when a mere youth, during two or three years
residence in Bologne, in the character, as I
suspect, of a commercial agent. This journal,
which I have occasionally seen, affords many
proofs of a sprightly and vigorous mind.
This, my friend, is the whole of my
present
recollections on this subject. I am
anxious
to know what has suggested your inquiry.
Is your mother acquainted with any of the
family in Europe? With the history of Wilmot
before he came hither? Pray tell me all you
know in your next.
Adieu.

LETTER XXI.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,
May
10.
As
soon as I had read your letter, I
hurried
to my mother. All her conjectures are
ascertained. A native of Holstein.... Family
abode near Taunton.... Victim of some early
distress. These circumstances place the truth
beyond controversy. But I will tell you the
story with somewhat more order.
I told you that my mother's curiosity was
awakened by the effect of your gloomy
prognostics
.
I told her every thing respecting Mary
Wilmot, but her love for you.
Wilmot.... Wilmot....said she. An English
family....Came over twenty-four years ago. I
think I know something of them. Their story
was a singular one; a disastrous one. I should
like to know more of their history. I think
it not improbable that these are the same
Wilmots
with those with whose history I am
perfectly
acquainted: Nay, more, who were no
very distant relations of our own. Pray write
to Ned, and get from him all he knows of their
early adventures. Inquire if the father was
from Holstein, and the mother from
Devonshire
,
and if Mary was born at Paris.
You see, my friend, your letter has
satisfactorily
confirmed these guesses; and now,
will I relate to you, the early history of this
family, in the words of my mother. Mary will
be greatly astonished when she comes to find
how much you know of her family....much
more, 'tis probable, than she herself knows....
and to discover that the nearest relations he has
in the world is myself. Being alone with my
mother, on Thursday evening, she fulfilled the
promise she had made, to tell me all she knew
of the Wilmots, in these words:
Mary Anne was the only daughter of my
father's only brother; consequently she was
my cousin. She was nearly of my own age,
and being the only child of a man, respectable
P
for birth and property, and my near relation,
and particularly of my own sex, we were
intimately
connected at an early age. She lost
her mother in her infancy, and our family
having
several daughters, our house was thought
more suited to her education than her father's.
She lived with me and my sisters till she was
eighteen years of age, receiving from us, our
brothers, and our parents, exactly the same
treatment which a real sister and daughter
received
.
There was no particular affection between
Mary and myself. Our tempers did not chance
to coincide. Her taste led her to one species
of amusement, and mine to another. This
difference
stood in the way of that union of
interests
,
which, however, took place between her
and my elder sister. Still, there were few
persons
in the world for whom I had a more
ardent esteem, or more tender affection, than
for my cousin Mary Anne. She parted from
us at the age of eighteen, in obedience to the
summons of her father, who wished to place
her at the head of his household. We lived
in the north, and Mr. Lisle lived in
Devonshire
,
so that we had little hope of any
intercourse
but by letter. This intercourse was
very punctually maintained between her and
my sister, and it was by means of this
correspondence
,
that we obtained the knowledge of
subsequent events.
On leaving our family, my cousin entered
into a world of strangers; a sphere very
incongenial
with her temper and habits. So long a
separation had deprived the parental character
of all those claims to reverence and confidence,
which are apt to arise when the lives of father
and daughter are spent under the same roof.
She saw in my uncle a man, who, in many
essential particulars, both of speculation and
of practice, was at variance with herself, and
to whom nature had given prerogatives which
her fearful temper foreboded would be oftener
exerted to her injury than benefit. His
inmates
,
his companions, his employments, his
sports, were dissonant with all the feelings she
was most accustomed to cherish. In short,
her new situation was in the highest degree
irksome.
She naturally looked abroad for that
comfort
which she could not find at home. She
formed intimacies with several persons of her
own sex, among others, with miss Saunders,
the daughter of a Bristol merchant, with whom
she spent as much time as her father would
allow her to spend. Her winter months were
generally passed in the society of that young
lady at Bristol; while her friend, in summer,
was her guest in the country.
It was at the house of Mr. Saunders that
she became acquainted with Veelmetz, or
Wilmot
,
a young man of uncommon elegance and
insinuation. He was a native of Germany,
but had received his early education in
England
.
He had, at this time, been for two or
three years chief, or confidential clerk, in an
English mercantile house, at Bologne, but
made occasional excursions on behalf of his
employer to the neighbouring countries. Some
concerns detained him a few months at Bristol,
and being on a familiar footing with the family
of Saunders, he there became acquainted with
my cousin.
On the first interview, my cousin was in
love with the stranger. It is impossible to tell
how far the laws of strict honour were observed
by Wilmot in his behaviour to my cousin,
either before or after the discovery of her
attachment
to him. Certain it is, that his heart
was devoted to another at the period of his
interview with Mary Anne; that she, at all
times, earnestly acquitted him of any duplicity
or treachery towards her, and ascribed the
unfortunate
cause of their mutual shame and
embarrassment to some infatuation; in
consequence
of which a man, who concealed not his
love and his engagement to another, and
without
the sanction or the promise of marriage,
prevailed on her to forget her dignity and her
duty.
Both parties deserved blame. Which
deserved
it most, and how far their guilt might
be extenuated or atoned for by the
circumstances
attending it, it is impossible to tell.
Mary Anne was a great, a mixed, and
doubtless
,
a faulty character. The world, in general,
was liberal of its eulogies on the probity, as
well as on the graces and talents of Wilmot.
His subsequent behaviour lay claim to some
praise; but his fatal meeting with my cousin,
proved that the virtue of both was capable of
yielding, when the integrity of worse people
would easily have stood firm.
P 2
About the same time, Wilmot returned to
Bologne, and my cousin accompanied her
father
to Paris. The lady to whom the former
was betrothed, was the daughter of the
principal
in that house, where Wilmot had long
been a servant, and in which, in consequence
of his merits, he was now shortly to become
a son and partner. The nuptial day was fixed.
Before the arrival of that day, he wrote a
letter to Mary Anne, acquainting her with his
present situation, reminding her that he never
practised any fraud or concealment in his
intercourse
with her; yet, nevertheless, offering
to come, and either by an open application to
her father, or by a clandestine marriage,
prevent
any evil that might threaten her safety or
her reputation.
This letter placed my cousin in the most
distressful dilemma that can be conceived.
Her heart was still fondly devoted to him that
made this offer. A fair fame was precious
in her eyes. Her father's wrath was terrible.
She knew that the accident, which Wilmot was
willing to provide against, would soon and
inevitably
befal her. Yet, in her answer to his
letter
,
the possibility of this accident was denied;
her attachment was denied, and he was
earnestly
conjured to complete his own happiness
and that of a worthier woman.
There were many generous pleas by which
my cousin might have accounted for her
conduct
.
She knew that the marriage he offered
would never be crowned with her father's
consent
;
that, on the contrary, his hatred and
vengeance would pursue them forever. That
Wilmot would thereby forfeit the honour
already
plighted to another; would inflict
exquisite
misery on that other and on himself, and
would forever cut himself off from that road
to fortune, which had now been opened to
him.
She was candid enough to confess that
these considerations, though powerful, did not
singly dictate her conduct. Her heart was, in
reality, full of grief. Despondency and horror
took possession of her whole soul. She hoped
to protract the discovery of her personal
condition
to a very late period, and then, when
further concealment was hopeless, designed
to put a violent end to life and all its cares.
Meanwhile, Wilmot's conscience being
somewhat relieved by my cousin's answer, he
gave himself up without restraint, to the
pleasurable
prospects before him. The day of
happiness was near at hand. He had little
leisure for any thing, but the offices of love
and tenderness, and was engaged, on the
evening
of a fine day, to accompany his mistress,
with a numerous party, on a rural excursion.
The carriage, ready to receive them, was at
the door, and he only waited, in a court before
the house, till the lady had adjusted her dress
for the occasion.
His mistress, Adela, having made the
requisite
adjustments, came out. She looked
around for her lover in vain. Some accident,
it was easily imagined, had called him for a
few moments away. She collected patience
to wait; but she waited and expected in vain.
Night came, and one day succeeded another,
but Wilmot did not appear. Inquiries were
set on foot, and messengers were dispatched,
but Wilmot had entirely vanished.
Some intelligence was, at last, gained of
him. It appeared, that while walking to and
fro in the court, two persons had came up to
him, and after a short dialogue, had retired
with him to an inn. There they had been
closeted
for a few minutes. After which they
came forth, and mounting horses that stood
at the gate, hastily left the city together.
The suspense and anxiety which this
circumstance
produced in the lady and her
family, may be easily imagined. Their
conjectures
wandered from one object to another,
without obtaining satisfaction. They could
gain from all their inquiries, no knowledge of
the persons who had summoned the young man
away. They inferred that the messengers were
the bearers of no good tidings; since the
attendants
at the inn reported that Wilmot's
countenance
and motions betrayed the utmost
consternation, on descending from the chamber
where the conference was held.
Their suspense was at length terminated by
the return of the fugitive himself. Wan,
sorrowful
,
and drooping, an horseman languidly
alighted, about ten days after Wilmot's
disappearance
,
at the gate. It was Wilmot himself.
The family flocked about, eager to express
their joy, terror, and surprise. He received
their greetings with affected cheerfulness, but
presently requesting an interview with Adela,
retired with her to her closet.
I suppose, my dear, you conjecture the
true cause of all these appearances. My
cousin's
secret was betrayed, by an unfaithful
confidant, to her father, whose rage, at the
discovery
,
was without bounds. He rushed into
his daughter's presence, in a transport of fury,
and easily extorted from her the author of her
disgrace. Without a moment's delay, he
ordered
horses, and in company with a friend,
made all possible haste to Bologne. The
daughter's uncertainty as to the cause and
object
of his journey, was ended by the return
of Mr. Lisle, in company with Wilmot. The
alternative offered to the youth, was to meet
the father with pistols, or to repair his child's
dishonour by marriage. Mr. Lisle's
impetuosity
overbore all my cousin's opposition, and
Wilmot, the moment he discovered her true
situation, was willing to repair the wrong to
the utmost of his power.
The ceremony being performed, Mr.
Lisle's pride was so far satisfied, but his rage
demanded nothing less than eternal
separation
from his daughter. Wilmot was obliged
to procure lodgings in a different quarter, and
my poor cousin left her father's presence, for
the last time, with his curses ringing in her
ears.
The horror occasioned by these events,
brought on a premature labour, the fruit of
which did not perish, as might have been
expected
,
but has survived to this day, and is no
other than your Mary Wilmot.
Poor Wilmot had an arduous office still to
perform. These events, and his new
condition
,
were to be disclosed to Adela. This it
was easy to do by letter, but he rather chose to
do full justice to his feelings in a formal
interview
.
And this was the purpose for which he
returned to Bologne.
It is not possible to imagine a more
deplorable
situation than that in which Wilmot was
now placed. He was torn forever from the
object of his dearest affections. At the
moment
when all obstacles were about to
disappear
,
and a few days were to unite those
hearts which had cherished a mutual passion
from infancy, he was compelled to pay the
forfeit of past transgressions, by binding
himself
to one who had his esteem, but not his
love. Adela was the pride and delight of
her family, and Wilmot had made himself
scarcely a less fervent interest in their
affections
.
That privilege he was now compelled
to resign, and by the same act, to break the
heart of the daughter, and excite
unextinguishable
animosity in the bosom of her
friends. Every tie dear to the human heart,
was now violently broken: every flattering
scheme of honour and fortune, baffled and
defeated. Nor had he the consolation to
reflect, that by these sacrifices he had secured
the happiness of, at least, one human being.
My cousin was an involuntary actor in this
scene. She had been overborne by her
father's menaces, and even by the
expostulations
and entreaties of Wilmot himself. The
irrevocable ceremony was hurried over without
a moment's deliberation or delay, and before
she had time to collect her thoughts and form
her resolutions, to recover from the first
confusions
of surprise and affright, she found
herself a wife and a mother.
It was, perhaps, merely the very conduct
which my cousin's feelings taught her to
pursue
,
that secured her ultimately some portion
of happiness. All the fault of the first
transgression
she imputed to herself. Wilmot was
the innocent and injured person: she only was
the injurer and criminal. Those upbraidings
which the anguish of his heart might have
prompted him to use, were anticipated; dwelt
upon and exaggerated; all the miseries of this
alliance passed, in as vivid hues before her
imagination, as before his. These images
plunged her into the most profound and
pitiable
sorrow.
Wilmot's generosity would by no means
admit, that her's only was the guilt. On the
contrary, his candour, awakened by her
example
,
was busy in aggravating his own crime.
His heart was touched by the proofs of her
extreme dejection; her disinterested regard.
He reflected, that her portion of evil was at
least equal to his own. Her sensibility to
reputation, her sense of right, her dependance
on her father for the means of subsistence, her
attachment to her country and kindred, all
contributed to heighten her peculiar calamity,
since she believed her fame to be blasted
forever
;
since her conscience reproached her
with all the guilt of their intercourse; since
her father had sworn never to treat her
as his child; since she had lost, in her own
Q
opinion, the esteem of all her relations and
friends, and solemnly vowed never to set foot
in her native country.
Wilmot's efforts to console his wife,
produced
insensibly a salutary effect on his own
feelings. Being obliged to search out topics
of comfort for her use, they were equally
conducive
to his own, and a habit of regarding
objects on their brightest side; of considering
my cousin as merely a subject of tenderness
and compassion; somewhat abated the edge
of his own misfortunes.
My father took infinite, though unsolicited
pains to reconcile the parent and child, but
my uncle could not be prevailed on to do more
than allow Wilmot a small annuity, with which
he retired to the town of Nice, and by a
recluse
and frugal life, subsisted, if not with
elegance
,
at least with comfort. Mary Anne was
extremely backward to cultivate the society
of her old friends. Their good offices she
took pains to repel and elude, and her only
source of consolation, with regard to them,
appeared
to be the hope that they had entirely
forgotten her. We, her cousins, were not,
however, deterred by her repulses, but did
every thing, in our power, to befriend her
cause with her inexorable father, and to
improve
her domestic situation. We had the
pleasure to find that Wilmot, though his
vivacity
,
his ambitious and enterprizing spirit was
flown, was an affectionate husband and
provident
father.
At my uncle's death we had hopes that
Mary Anne's situation would be bettered. His
will, however, bequeathed all his estate to his
nephew, my elder brother, and the Wilmots
were deprived even of that slender stipend
which they had hitherto enjoyed. This
injustice
was, in some degree, repaired by my
brother, who, as soon as the affairs of the
deceased
were arranged, sent a very large
present
to Wilmot. They did not make us
acquainted with the motives of their new
resolutions
.
We were merely informed,
indirectly
,
that on the receipt of this sum, Wilmot
repaired with his family to some port in
France, and embarked for the colonies. Time
insensibly wore away the memory of these
transactions, and 'tis a long time since my
sisters and I have been accustomed, in
reviewing
past events, to inquire What has
become of poor Mrs. Wilmot and her
children
?
Such, Edward, was my mother's relation.
Is it not an affecting one. And is, indeed,
thy Mary the remnant of this family? They
had several children, but most of them found
an early grave in Europe, and the eldest, it
seems, is the sole survivor. We must make
haste, my friend, to raise her from obscurity
and make her happy.
Is it not likely that Mary knows nothing of
her mother's history? Being only ten years
old at her death, the child would scarcely be
made the confidant of such transactions. The
father, it is likely, would be equally prone to
silence, on such a topic.
Our fortune is strongly influenced by
our ignorance. What can be more lonely and
forlorn than the life thy poor friend has led.
Yet had she returned to her mother's native
country, and disclosed her relation to the
present
mistress of
Littlelisle
, she would have been
instantly admitted to the house and bosom of
a fond mother.
My uncle, to whom I told you the estate
of Mary's grandfather was bequeathed, died
unmarried and left this property to the sister,
who was the intimate of Mary Anne, and who
never lost the tenderest respect for her youthful
friend. This happened some years after
Wilmot's
voyage to the colonies. My aunt being
childless and a widow, was extremely solicitous
to discover Mary Anne's retreat, and restore
her, or her children to at least, a part of that
property, to the whole of which their title was,
strictly speaking, better than her own. For
this end, she made a great many inquiries in
America, but none of them met with success.
I have written a long letter. Yet I could
add much more, were I not afraid of losing
this post. So let me hear thy comments on
all these particulars, and tell me, especially,
when I may certainly expect thy return.
Adieu
Clara

LETTER XXII.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
May
11.
Thanks
, a thousand thanks, my
beloved
friend, for thy story. It has absorbed and
overwhelmed every other thought and feeling.
Since I received it, I have done nothing but
peruse and ponder on thy letter. It has opened
cheerful prospects for my poor friend. Shall
we not see her restored to her native country:
to her original rank, and the affluence to which
she is entitled by her birth, her education and
her former sufferings? I trust, we shall.
'Tis impossible to guess how far she is
acquainted
with the history of her parents: but
that and every other doubt will, I hope,
speedily
be put to flight.
I hope that this is the last letter I shall
have occasion to write to you. The next time
I shall address you, will be through no such
wild and ambiguous medium.
May I find my Clara all gentleness; all
condescension; all love. So, with all his
heart, prays her
Edward

LETTER XXIII.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,
May
11.
By
the calm tenor of this letter you will
hardly judge of the state of my mind before I
sat down to write. To describe it would be
doing wrong to myself and to you. I am not
anxious to pass for better than I am; to hide
my weakness, or to dwell upon my folly. In
this letter to paint the struggles between
reason
and passion, would be making more
arduous
that task which I must assign to you.
I have formerly concealed these struggles.
My motive was not shame. I aimed not to
shun contempt, by concealing my defects; for,
alas! the spirit with which I had to deal,
modelled
his opinions by a standard different from
mine. That which was selfish and base in my
eyes, was praise-worthy in his. I passed for
obdurate and absurd, in proportion as I acted
in a manner which appeared to me generous
and just.
I concealed these struggles, because I
hated to reflect upon my own faults; because
they were past, and the better thoughts that
succeeded were sources of complacency too
precious to be lost, and attained and preserved
with so much difficulty, that to review the
conflicts
which it cost me to gain them, would
hazard their loss.
Thus it is, at present. I write to you, not
to give utterance and new existence to anguish
no longer felt. I write to you to tell my
present
views, and they cannot waver or change.
My friend, the bearer of this is your Mary.
She is not happy. She is not anothers. She
is poor, but good, and no doubt as much
devoted
to you as ever. Need I point out to
you the road which you ought to take! Need
I enforce, by arguments, that duty which
compels
you to consult her happiness, by every
honest means?
Could I but inspire you, my friend, with
the sentiments that now possess my heart:
could I but make your convictions at once
just and strong, and convert you into a
cheerful
performer of your duty, I should, indeed,
be happy.
You will wonder by what means Mary has
been made known to me. I will tell you. I
went to pay a visit, long since due, to Mrs.
Etheridge. It was but yesterday. After
cursory discourse she mentioned that she
expected
in a few minutes to see a lady, who
was going on the morrow to Philadelphia. I
had written to you, and was not unwilling to
make use of this opportunity. What, I asked,
is her name? Her character? Her situation?
Mary Wilmot. She has just come from
New-Haven, where she has passed the winter
with a friend. She is amiable, but
unfortunate
.
You will imagine with what emotions I
listened to these words. For some minutes
I was too much surprised to think or to speak
clearly. My companion noticed my emotion,
but before she could inquire into the cause, a
visitant was announced, and Miss Wilmot
herself
entered the room. Being introduced to
each other, my name occasioned as much
surprise
and embarrassment as hers had given to
me. The interview ended abruptly, but not
till I had so far collected my thoughts, as to
request her to be the bearer of a letter. She
mentioned the place where it might be left
and we parted.
I ought to have acted in a different
manner
.
I ought to have asked her company
home, have sought her confidence, have
unbosomed
myself to her, and removed every
obstacle to her union with you, which might
arise from an erring judgment or an unwise
generosity.
But I was unfitted for this by the
suddenness
of our interview. I had not time to
subdue
those trembling and mixed feelings which
the sight of her produced, before she
withdrew
,
and I had not courage enough to visit
her at her lodgings, and be the bearer of my
own letter. so much the more arduous is the
task which belongs to you. My deficiencies
must be supplied by you. Act uprightly and
ingenuously, my friend, I entreat you. Seek
her presence, and shew her this and every
other letter from me. Offer her, beseech her,
compel her, to accept your vows.
Accuse me not of fickleness. Acquit me
of mean and ungenerous behaviour. Dream
not that reasoning or entreaty will effect any
change in my present sentiments. I love you,
Edward, as I ought to love you. I love your
happiness; your virtue. I resign you to this
good girl as to one who deserves you more
than I; whose happiness is more dependent
on the affections of another than mine is.
What passion is now wanting in you time will
shortly supply. In such a case, you must and
will act and feel as you ought.
Let me not hear from you till you have
seen her. I know whence will arise the failure
of your efforts on such an interview. If she
withstand your eloquence, it will be because
you have betrayed your cause, or because she
acts from a romantic and groundless
generosity
with regard to me. The last obstacle,
it will be my province to remove. I will
write to her, and convince her that by
rejecting
you on my account she does me injury and
not benefit, and is an enemy to your happiness;
for while Mary lives, and is not bound to
another, I will never be to you any thing but
Your friend,
C. H.

LETTER XXIV.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
May
13.
MY FRIEND,
I do
not mean to reason with you. When
I tell you that you are wrong, I am far from
expecting your assent to my assertion. I say
it not in a tone of bitterness or deprecation.
I am calm, in this respect, as yourself. There
is nothing to ruffle my calm. We fluctuate
and are impatient, only when doubtful of the
future. Our fate being sealed, and an end
being put to suspense and to doubt, the
passions
are still. Sedateness and tranquillity at
least are ours.
There is nothing, I repeat, to ruffle my
calm. I am not angry with you, for I know
the purity and rectitude of your motives.
Your judgment only is misguided, but that
is no source of impatience or repining to me.
It is beyond my power, or that of time, to
rectify your error.
I do not pity you. You aspire to true
happiness
,
the gift of self-approbation and of
virtuous
forbearance. You have adopted the
means necessary to this end, and the end is
gained. Why then should I pity you? You
would not derive more happiness from a
different
decision. Another would, indeed, be
more happy, but you would, perhaps, be less.
At any rate, your enjoyments would not be
greater than they now are; for what
gratification
can be compared to that arising from the
sense of doing as we ought?
I believe you in the wrong, and I tell you
so. It is proper that the truth should be known.
It is proper that my opinion, and the grounds
of it should be known to you. Not that after
this disclosure,
you
will think or act differently.
Of that I have not the least hope.
You are wrong, Clara. You study, it seems,
the good of others. You desire the benefit of
this girl; and since her happiness lies in being
united to me, and in possessing my affections,
you wish to unite us, and to transfer to her my
love.
It cannot be done. Marry her I may, but
I shall not love her. I cannot love her. This
incapacity, you will think argues infirmity and
vice in me, and lessens me in your esteem. It
ought not to produce this effect. It is a proof
of neither wickedness nor folly. I cannot love
her, because my affections are already devoted
to one more attractive and more excellent than
she.
She has my reverence. If wedlock unites
us, my fidelity will never be broken. I will
watch over her safety with unfailing solicitude.
She shall share every feeling and thought. The
ties of the tenderest friendship shall be hers,
but....nothing more.
You will say that more is due to her; that
a just man will add to every office of a friend
the sanction of ineffable passion. I will not
discuss with you the propriety of loving
my
wife
, when her moral and intellectual
excellence
is unquestionable, and when all her love
is bestowed upon me. I will only repeat, that
passion will never be felt.
What then will be the fruit of marriage?
Nothing but woe to her whom you labour, by
uniting us, to make happy. You rely,
however
,
on the influence of time and intercourse
to beget that passion which is now wanting.
And think you that this girl will wed a man
who loves her not?
She never will. Our union is
impracticable
,
not from opposition or refusal on my side,
but on hers. As to me, my concurrence shall
be full, cheerful, zealous. Argument and
importunity
will not be wanting. If they fail,
you will ascribe their failure to my coldness,
ambiguity or artifice, or to mistaken
generosity
in her with regard to you. The last
motive
,
after due representations, will not exist.
The former cause may possess some influence,
for I shall act with scrupulous sincerity. I
shall counterfeit no passion and no warmth.
The simple and unembellished truth shall be
told to her, and this I know will be an
insurmountable
impediment.
But suppose, for a moment, this obstacle
to disappear, and that Mary is happy as the
wife one who esteems her, indeed, but loves
her not. Your end is accomplished. You
R 2
proceed to reap the fruits of disinterested
virtue
,
and contemplate the felicity which is your
own work.
This girl is the only one of God's creatures
worthy of benevolence. No other is entitled
to the sacrifice of your inclination. None
there are in whose happiness you find a
recompence
for evils and privations befalling
yourself
.
As to me, I am an inert and insensible
atom, or I move in so remote a sphere that
my pains or pleasures are independent of any
will or exertion of yours. But no; that is a
dignity of which I must not boast. I am so far
sunk into depravity, that all my desires are the
instigations of guilt, and all my pleasures those
of iniquity. Duty tells you to withstand and
to thwart, not to gratify my wishes.
I love you, and my happiness depends upon
your favour. Without you, or with another,
I can know no joy. But this, in your opinion,
is folly and perverseness. To aspire to your
favour, when it is beyond my reach, is
criminal
infatuation. Not to love her who loves me,
and whose happiness depends upon my love,
is, you think, cruel and unjust. Be it so. Great
indeed, is my demerit. Worthless and
depraved
am I, but not single in iniquity and
wretchedness; for the rule is fallacious that is
not applicable to all others in the same
circumstances
.
That conduct which in me is
culpable
,
is no less culpable in others. Am I cruel
and unjust, in refusing my love to one that
claims it? So are you, whose refusal is no less
obstinate as to me, as mine with respect to
another; and who hearkens not to claims upon
your sympathy, as reasonable as those of Mary
on mine.
And how is it that miss Wilmot's merits
tower so far above mine? By placing her
happiness in gaining affections which are
obstinately
withheld; by sacrificing the duty she
owes herself, her fellow-creatures, and her
God, to grief, because the capricious feelings
of another have chosen a different object of
devotion, does she afford no proof of
infatuation
and perverseness? Is she not at least
sunk to a level with me?
But Mary Wilmot and I are not the only
persons affected by your decision. There is
another more entitled to the affections of this
woman than I, because he loves her; because,
in spite of coldness, poverty, and personal
defects; in spite of repulse from her, the
aversion
of his family, and the inticements of those
to whom his birth, fortune, and exterior
accomplishments
have made him desirable,
continues
to love her. With regard to this man
is she not exactly in the same relation as I am to
her? Is it not her duty to consult his
happiness
,
and no longer to oppose his laudable and
generous wishes? For him and for me, your
benevolence sleeps. With regard to us you
have neither consideration nor humanity.
They are all absorbed in the cause of one,
whose merits, whose claim to your sympathy
and aid, if it be not less, is far from being
greater than Sedley's or mine.
My path is, indeed, plain. I mean to visit
miss Wilmot; but before I see her, I shall
transmit to her all the letters that have passed
between you and me on this subject, and
particularly
a copy of
this
. She shall not be
deceived
.
She shall judge with all the materials of
a right judgment before her. I am prepared
to devote myself to her will; to join my fate
to hers to-morrow. I do not fear any lessening
of my reverence for her virtues, of that
tenderness
which will be her due, and which it
becomes
him to feel in whose hands is deposited
the weal or woe of a woman truly excellent.
We have wherewith to secure the blessings
of competence. With that we will seek the
shores of the Ohio, and devote ourselves to
rural affairs. You and yours I shall strive to
forget. Justice to my wife and to myself, will
require this at my hand.
Adieu.

I
am
impatient to see you, and assure
myself from your own lips, of your welfare;
but there is a necessity for postponing my
visit till to-morrow evening. Then I will see
you; meanwhile, read the inclosed papers.
One is a narrative of occurrences since the
date of my last letter to you from Hatfield.
The rest are letters that have been written to
miss Howard, or received from her, down to
the present hour. Read them, and reflect
deeply and impartially on their contents. They
require no preface or commentary. Make up
your mind by evening, when I will attend you
with an heart overflowing with the affection of
a friend, and prepared to perform, with zeal
and cheerfulness, whatever the cause of your
felicity requires from

LETTER XXVI.
TO MISS HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
May
15.
I
sit
down to relate what, perhaps, will
afford you pain instead of pleasure. I know not
whether I ought to give you pain, by this recital.
Having no longer the power of living for my
own happiness, I had wrought up my mind
to the fervent wish of living for the sake of
another. I found consolation in the thought
of being useful to a human being.
Now my condition is forlorn and dreary.
That sedate and mixed kind of happiness, on
which I had set my wishes, is denied to me.
My last hope, meagre and poor as it was, is
extinguished forever. The fire that glowed
in my bosom, languishes. I am like one let
loose upon a perilous sea, without rudder or
sail.
I have made preparation to leave this city
to-morrow, by the dawn of day, on a journey
from which I neither wish nor expect to return.
I at this moment anticipate the dawn of
comfort
,
from the scenes of the wilderness and of
savage life. I begin to adopt, with seriousness,
a plan which has often occurred to my
juvenile
reveries.
In my uncle's parlour there hangs a rude
outline of the continent of North-America.
Many an hour have I gazed upon it, and
indulged
that romantic love of enterprize, for which I
have ever been distinguished. My eye used
to leap from the shore of Ontario, to the
obscure
rivulets which form, by their conflux, the
Allegheny. This have I pursued through all
its windings, till its stream was lost in that of the
Ohio. Along this river have I steered and
paddled my canoe of bark, many hundreds of
leagues, till the Missisippi was attained. Down
that mighty current I allowed myself to be
passively
borne, till the mouths of Missouri opened
to my view. A more arduous task, and one
hitherto
unattempted, then remained for me. In
S
the ardours of my fancy, all perils and hardships
were despised, and I boldly adventured to
struggle against the current of Missouri, to
combat the dangers of an untried navigation,
of hostile tribes, and unknown regions.
Having gained the remotest sources of the
river, I proceeded to drag my barque over
mountains and rocks, till I lighted upon the
vallies and streams that tend to the north and
west. On one of these I again embarked.
The rivulets insensibly swelled into majestic
streams. Lurking sands and overhanging
cliffs gradually disappeared, and a river flowed
beneath me, as spacious in its breadth and
depth, and wandering through as many realms,
as the Wolga or the Oronoco. After a tedious
navigation of two thousand miles, I at last
entered
a bay of the ocean, and descried the
shores of the great Pacific. This purpose
being gained, I was little anxious to return,
and allowed my fancy to range at will over the
boundless field of contingencies, by some of
which I might be transported across the ocean
to China, or along the coast to the dominions
of the Spaniards.
This scheme, suspended and forgotten for
awhile, I have now resumed. To-morrow I go
hence, in company with a person who holds
an high rank in the Spanish districts westward
of the Missisippi.
You will not receive this letter, or be
apprised
of my intentions, till after I am gone. I
shall dispatch it at the moment of my leaving
this city. I shall not write to Mr. Howard.
I want not his aid or his counsel. I know that
his views are very different from mine. I shall
awaken opposition and remonstrance, which
will answer no end but to give me torment and
inquietude. To you I leave the task of
informing
him of my destiny, or allow him, if you
please, to be wholly unacquainted with it.
Either conduct is indifferent to me.
But there is one in whose welfare you
condescend
to take some interest, and of whom I
am able to communicate some tidings. Some
commands which you laid upon me in relation
to Mary have been fulfilled, and I shall now
acquaint you with the result.
She sent me your letter not many hours
after it was written, with a note, informing me
of her place of abode, and requesting a
meeting
with me. A letter from you, by her hands,
was a cause of sufficient wonder; but the
contents
of your letter were far more wonderful
than the mode of its conveyance. The
handwriting
assured me it was yours. The style
and sentiments were alien to all that my fancy
had connected with your name. With these
tokens of profound indifference to my
happiness
,
of ineffable contempt for my person and
character, I compared the solicitude and
tenderness which your preceding letter had
breathed, and was utterly lost in horror and
doubt. But this is not the strain in which I
ought to write to you. Reason should set
my happiness beyond the love or enmity of
another not wiser or more discerning or
benevolent
than myself. If reason be inadequate
to my deliverance, pride should hinder me
from disclosing my humiliation; from
confessing
my voluntary servitude.
After my discomposure was somewhat
abated, I proceeded to reflect on what was
now to be done. Compliance with your
dictates
was obvious. Since I was no longer of
importance to your happiness, it was time to
remember what was due to that angelic
sufferer
.
I have already told you that I sent your
letters, and promised to see her in the evening.
I went at the appointed hour. I entered her
apartment with a throbbing heart, for she is
my friend. Near a year had passed since I
had last seen her. This interval had been
tormented
with doubts of her safety, of her
happiness
,
of her virtue, and even her existence.
These doubts were removed, or about to be
solved. My own eyes were to bear testimony
to the truth of her existence.
I was admitted to her. I hastened to
communicate
my wishes. I enforced them by all
the eloquence that I was master of, but my
eloquence was powerless. She was too blind
an admirer, and assiduous a follower of Clara
Howard, to accept my proffers. I abruptly
withdrew.
Heaven protect thee and her! I shall carry,
I fear, the images of both of you along with
me. Their company will not be friendly to
courage or constancy. I shall shut them out
as soon as I can.

LETTER XXVII.
TO MISS HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
May 13, Noon
.
I feel
some reluctance and
embarrassment
in addressing you in this manner, but am
enabled, in some degree, to surmount them, by
reflecting on the proofs which are now in my
hands, of the interest which you take in my
welfare, and of the inimitable generosity of
your sentiments. I am likewise stimulated by
the regard, which, in common with yourself,
I feel for an excellent youth, to whose
happiness
this letter may essentially contribute.
I have seen you but for a moment. I was
prepared to find in you all that could inspire
veneration and love. That my prepossessions
were fully verified, will, perhaps, redound
little
to the credit of my penetration or your
beauty, since we seldom fail to discover in the
features, tokens of all that we imagine to
exist
within.
I know you by more copious and
satisfactory
means; by several letters which Edward
Hartley has put into my hands. By these it
likewise appears, that you have some
acquaintance
with me, collected from the same source,
and from the representations of my friend.
The character and situation, the early history
and unfortunate attachment of Mary, and that
expedient which she adopted to free herself
from useless importunities and repinings, are
already known to you.
This makes it needless for me to mention
many particulars of my early life; they
authorise
the present letter, and allow me, or,
perhaps
,
to speak more truly, they enjoin me
to confide in you a relation of some incidents
that have lately occurred. Your sensibility
would render them of some moment in your
eyes, should they possess no relation but to a
forlorn and unhappy girl; but their importance
will be greater, inasmuch as they are
connected
with your own destiny, and with that
of one, whom you justly hold dear. I shall
claim your attention for as short a time as
possible.
A letter, written last autumn, to Edward
Hartley, informing him of the motives that
induced me to withdraw from his society, has
been shewn to you. It will, therefore, be
needless to explain these motives anew. I
console myself with believing, that they
merited
and obtained the approbation of so
enlightened and delicate a judge as Clara
Howard.
The place of my retreat was determined
by the kind offers and solicitations of a lady,
by name, Valentine. In other circumstances,
similar solicitations from her had been refused,
but now I was anxious to retire to a great and
unknown distance from my usual home; to
retire without delay, but my health was
imperfect
.
I was a female without knowledge
of the world, without the means of subsistence,
and the season was cold and boisterous. Mrs.
Valentine was opulent; her character entitled
her to confidence and love; her engagements
required her immediate departure; she would
travel with all possible advantages; her new
abode was at a great distance from my own;
and she meant to continue absent during the
ensuing year. There was but one
consideration
to make me hesitate.
Her brother had long offered me his
affections
.
Mrs. Valentine had been his advocate,
and endeavoured to win my favour, or at least,
to facilitate his own exertions, by promoting
our intercourse.
I had been hitherto unjust to the merits
of this man. His constancy, his generosity,
his gifts of person, understanding and fortune,
might have won the heart of a woman less
prepossessed
in favour of another. My
indifference
,
my aversion, were proportioned to that
fervent love with which my heart was inspired
by another. I thought it my duty to avoid
every means by which the impracticable
wishes of Sedley might be fostered. For this
end, I had hitherto declined most of those
offers of friendship and intercourse with which
I had been honoured by his sister.
My unhappy situation had now reduced
me to the necessity of violating some of my
maxims. I should never have accompanied
Mrs. Valentine, however, had I not been
previously
assured that her brother designed to
live at a distance. It was impossible to object
to his design of accompanying us to the end of
our journey.
That journey was accomplished. We
arrived
,
at the eve of winter, in the
neighbourhood
of Boston. The treatment I received
from my friend, was scrupulously delicate.
She acted with the frankness and affection of a
sister; but I think with shame, on that absurd
pride which hindered me from practising the
same candour. I was born in an affluent
condition
,
but the misfortune of my parents,
while they trained me up in a thousand
prejudices
,
left me, at the age of eighteen, totally
destitute of property or friends. There was
no human being on whom the customs of the
world would allow me to depend. My only
relation was a younger brother, who was still
a boy, and who needed protection, as much as
myself. In this state, I had recourse for
honest
bread, to my needle; but the bread thus
procured was mingled with many bitter tears.
I conceived myself degraded by my labour;
my penury was aggravated by remembrance of
my former enjoyments. I shrunk from the
salutation, or avoided the path, of my early
companions. I imagined that they would
regard my fallen state with contempt, or with
pity, no less hard to be endured than scorn. I
laboured sometimes by unjustifiable and
disingenuous
artifices, to conceal my employments
and my wants, and masked my cares as well
as I was able, under cheerful looks.
This spirit led me to conceal from Mrs.
Valentine my forlorn condition. I looked
forward without hope, to the hour when new
labour would be requisite to procure for me
shelter and food. For there, I was at present
indebted to my friend; but I loved to regard
myself merely as a visitant, and anticipate the
time when I should cease to lie under obligation.
Meanwhile, there were many little and
occasional
sources of expense, to which my
ill-supplied
purse was unequal; while a thousand
obstacles existed under this roof, to any
profitable
application of my time. Hence arose
new cause of vexation, and new force to my
melancholy.
All my stratagems could not conceal from
my friend my poverty. For a time, she
struggled
to accommodate herself to my scruples,
and to aid me, without seeming to know the
extent of my necessities. These struggles
were frustrated by my obstinate pride. I
steadily
refused either money or credit.
At length, she resolved to enter into full
explanations with me, on this subject. She
laid before me, with simplicity and candour,
all her suspicions and surmises, and finally
extorted
from me a confession that I was not
mistress of a single dollar in the world; that I
had no kinsman to whom I could betake
myself
for the supply of my wants; no fund on
which I was authorized to draw for a
farthing
.
This declaration was heard with the
strongest
emotion. She betrayed surprise and
disappointment
.
After a pause, she expressed
her astonishment at this news. She reminded
me how little it agreed with past appearances.
She had known me, during the latter part of
my brother's life, and since. My brother's
profession had apparently been useful to my
subsistence, and since his death, though
indeed
the period had been short, I had lived
in a neat seclusion, and at leisure.
These hints induced me to be more frank
in my disclosures. I related what is already
known to you, the fate of the money which I
inherited from my brother, the doubtful
circumstances
that attended my brother's
possession
,
and the irresistible claim of Morton.
Every word of my narrative added anew
to my friends surprise and disappointment.
She continued for a long time silent, but much
disquiet was betrayed by her looks. I
mistook
these for signs of disapprobation of my
conduct, and began to justify myself. Dear
madam! Would you not, in my place, have
acted in this manner?
Just so, Mary. Your conclusion was
highly
plausible.
I believe my conclusion, replied I, to be
certain. I did not require any stronger proof
of Morton's title.
And yet his claim was fallacious. This
money was yours, and only yours.
This assertion was made with a confidence
that convinced me of its truth, and caused my
mind instantly to adopt a new method of
accounting
for the acquisition of this money.
My eyes, fixed upon my companion, betrayed
T
my suspicion that my benefactress was before
me. Humiliation and gratitude were mingled
in my heart. Tears gushed from my eyes,
while I pressed her hand to my lips.
Ah! said I, if Morton were not the
giver, who should know the defects of his
title, but the real giver?
Your gratitude, Mary, is misplaced. You
might easily imagine that my funds would
never allow me to be liberal to that amount.
Is it not you? Whose then was the
bounteous
spirit? You are, at least, acquainted with
the real benefactor.
I confess that I am, but may not be
authorized
to disclose the name.
I besought her to disclose her name.
The motive, said my friend, is obvious.
It could only be the dread that, knowing your
scrupulousness on this head, you would refuse
the boon, and thus frustrate a purpose truly
benevolent. This apprehension being
removed
,
there can certainly be no reason for
concealment
.
I am entirely of your opinion, that
the author of every good deed should be
known not only to the subject of the benefit,
but to all mankind.
After much solicitation she, at length,
confessed
that this money was the gift of Mr.
Sedley
to my brother. She stated the motives of
this uncommon liberality. Sedley had made
his sister acquainted with his passion for me,
and had engaged her counsel and aid. Her
counsel had always been, to abandon a pursuit
whose success was hopeless....Perceiving your
reluctance, continued my friend, and finding
it to arise from a passion for another, I
earnestly
dissuaded him from persisting in claims
which were hurtful to you without profiting
himself. His passion sometimes led him to
accuse you of frowardness and obstinacy, and,
at those times, I had much ado to defend you,
and to prove your right to consult your own
happiness.
But these moments, I must say in justice
to my brother, were few. I could generally
reason him into better temper. He could see,
at least for a time, the propriety of ceasing to
vex you with entreaties and arguments, and
was generous enough to wish you happiness,
even with another. This spirit led him to
inquire into the character and condition of
your chosen friend. For this purpose he
cultivated
the acquaintance of your brother, and
discovered that the only obstacle to your union
with young Hartley, was your mutual
poverty
.
After many struggles, many fits of
jealousy
,
and anger, and melancholy, he
determined
to lay aside every selfish wish, and to
remove this obstacle to your happiness, by
giving you possession of sufficient property.
This undertaking was in the highest
degree
arduous and delicate. To make the
offer directly to you, was chimerical. No
power on earth, he well knew, could persuade
you to receive a free gift in money from one
whose pretensions had been such as his. To
bestow it upon Hartley, would be exposing the
success of his scheme to hazard. His scruples
would be as likely to exclaim against such a
gift, as loudly as yours, especially when
attended
with those conditions which it would be
necessary to prescribe. There was likewise no
certainty that his gift might not be diverted by
Hartley to other purposes than those which he
sought. Neither did he wish to ensure your
marriage with another, upon terms which
should appear to lay you under obligations to
that other. Besides, your union with Hartley,
was, in some degree, uncertain. A thousand
untoward events might occur to protract or
prevent it, whereas your poverty was a present
and constant evil.
After discussing a great number of
expedients
,
he adopted one, at length, which,
perhaps
,
was as unskilful as any which he could
have lighted on. By talking with your brother,
he found him possessed of a quick, indignant,
and lofty spirit; one that recoiled from
pecuniary
obligations; that placed a kind of glory
in being poor, and in devoting his efforts to
benevolent, rather than to lucrative purposes.
He saw that direct offers of money, to any
considerable
amount, and accompanied with no
conditions, or by conditions which respected
his sister, would be disdainfully rejected. He
determined, therefore, to leave him no option,
and to put a certain sum in his possession
without it being possible for him to discover
the donor, or to refuse the gift. This sum
was, therefore, sent to him, under cover of a
short billet, without signature, and in a
disguised
hand.
This scheme was not disclosed to me till
after it was executed. I did not approve it. I
T 2
am no friend to indirect proceedings. I was
aware of many accidents that might make this
gift an hurtful one, or, at least, useless to the
end Sedley proposed. Your brother's scruples,
which hindered him from openly accepting
it, were likely to prevent him from applying
so large a sum to his own, or to your benefit.
He would either let it lie idly in his coffers,
under the belief that so ambiguous a transfer
gave him no right to it, or he would, more
probably, spend it on some charitable scheme.
I was acquainted with his enthusiasm, in the
cause of what he called the good of mankind,
and that his notions of the goods and evils of
life differed much from those of his sister.
This act, however, was not to be recalled,
and it was useless to make my brother repent
of his precipitation. I hoped that his
intention
would not be defeated, and watched the
conduct of your brother very carefully, to
discover
the effect of his new acquisitions. The
effect was such as I expected. Your brother's
mode of life underwent no change; and the
money, as there were easy means of
discovering
,
lay in one of the banks, untouched.
My curiosity was awakened anew at your
brother's death, and Sedley had the
satisfaction
of perceiving that your condition was
visibly improved. You no longer hired out
your labour. You lived in retirement, indeed,
but with some degree of neatness; and your
time was spent in improving and adorning
your mind, and in those offices of kindness
and charity, which, however arduous in
themselves
,
are made light by the consciousness of
dignity attending them.
I admire and love you, and that day which
would make you my sister, I should count
the happiest of my life. You have treated me
with much distance and reserve, but I flattered
myself that my overtures to intimacy, had
been rejected not on my own account, but on
that of my brother. Since you have been my
companion, I have noticed the proofs of your
poverty, with great uneasiness. I know, that
your money, all but a few hundred dollars,
still lies in one of the banks. Will you
pardon me for having been attentive to your
conduct? For my brother's sake, and for your
own, I have watched all your movements,
and could tell you the times and portions in
which these hundreds have been drawn out;
and have formed very plausible guesses as to
the mode in which you have disposed of
them.
How to reconcile your seeming poverty
with the possession of some thousands, how
to account for your acquiescence in my wishes
to attend me hither, and for forbearing to use
any more of this money for the supply of your
own wants, has puzzled me a great deal. I
perceive that you have dropped all intercouse
with your former friend, and given up yourself
a prey to melancholy. These things have
excited
,
you will imagine, a great deal of
reflection
,
but I have patiently waited till you
yourself
have thought proper to put aside the
curtain that is drawn between us. This you
have at length done, and I in my turn have
disclosed what I am afraid my brother will
never forgive me for doing.
I could not but be deeply affected by this
representation. The generosity of Sedley and
his sister, their perseverance in labouring for
my good, when no personal advantage, not
even the homage of a grateful spirit, could
flow to themselves, made me feel the stings of
somewhat like ingratitude. The merits and
claims of Sedley came now to assume a new
aspect. I had hitherto suffered different
objects
to engross my attention. I did not
applaud
or condemn myself for my conduct
towards him, merely because I did not think
of him. I was occupied by gloomy reveries,
in which no images appeared but those of
Hartley and my brother.
Now the subjects of my thoughts were
changed. Time had insensibly, and, in some
degree, worn out those deep traces, which I
brought away with me from Abingdon. Pity
and complacency, and reverence for Sedley;
gratitude to his sister, from whom I had
received
so many favours, and who would deem
herself amply repaid by my consent to make
her brother happy, hourly gained ground in
my heart.
These tendencies did not escape my friend,
who endeavoured to strengthen and promote
them. She insisted on the merits of her
brother
,
arising from the integrity of his life, the
elevation of his sentiments, and especially the
constancy of his affection to me. She praised
my self-denial with regard to Hartley, and
hinted, that my duty to him was but half
performed
.
It became me to shew that my
happiness
was consistent with self-denial.
Marriage
with miss Howard will give him but
little pleasure, she said, while he is a stranger
to your fate, or while he knows that you are
unhappy. For his sake, it becomes you, to
shake off all useless repinings. To waste your
days in this dejection, in longings after what
is unattainable, and what you have voluntarily
given up, is contemptible, and, indeed,
criminal
.
You have profited but little by the lessons
of that religion you profess, if you see not the
impiety of despair, and the necessity of
changing
your conduct.
You have, indeed, fallen into a very gross
error with regard to your friend. In some
respects, you have treated him in an inhuman
manner.
Good heaven, Mrs. Valentine, in what
respect have I been inhuman?
Have you not detailed to me the contents
of the letter which you left behind you at
Abingdon? In that letter have you not assured
him that your heart was broken; that you
expected
and wished for death....wishes that
sprung from the necessity there was of
renouncing
his love! Have you not given him
reason to suppose that you are enduring all
the evils of penury and neglect; that you are
languishing in some obscure corner, unknown,
neglected, forgotten, and despised by all
mankind
?
Have you not done this?
Alas! it is too true.
Not to mention that this picture was by no
means justified by the circumstances in which
you left Abingdon, and in which you could
not but expect to pass the winter, amidst all
the comforts which my character, my station
in society, my friends, my fortune, and my
friendship must bestow....not to mention these
things, which rendered your statement to him
untrue, what must have been the influence of
this picture upon the feelings of that generous
youth? Can you not imagine his affliction?
O yes, indeed, I can. I was wrong: I now
see my error. I believed that I should not
have survived to this hour. I wanted to cut
off every hope, every possibility of his union
with me.
And do you think that, by that letter, this
end was answered? Do not you perceive that
Hartley's sympathy for you must have been
infinitely increased by that distressful picture?
that his resolution to find you out in your
retreat
and compel you to be happy, would receive
tenfold energy? You imagine yourself to have
resigned him to miss Howard, but your letter
and your flight could only bind him by stronger
ties to yourself. Should this lady be inclined
to favour Hartley, of what materials must her
heart be composed, if she do not refuse, or at
least, hesitate to interfere with your claims?
If she do not refuse, how must her happiness
be embittered by reflections on your forlorn
state? for no doubt the young man's sincerity
will make her mistress of your story.
Do not dwell upon this theme, said I. I
am grieved for my folly. I have been very
wrong. Tell me rather, my beloved monitor,
what I ought to have done: what I may still do.
It would be useless to dwell on what is
past, and cannot be undone. The future is
fully in your power. Without doubt you ought
to hasten to repair the errors you have
committed
.
By what means?
They are obvious. You must dismiss these
useless, these pernicious regrets, which, in
every view, religious or moral, are criminal.
You must give admission to cheerful thoughts;
fix your attention on the objects of useful
knowledge; study the happiness of those around
you; be affable and social, and entitle yourself
to the friendship and respect of the many
amiable persons who live near us. Above all,
make haste to inform Hartley of your present
condition; disclose to him your new prospects
of being useful and happy; and teach him to
be wise by your example.
But let your kindness be most shewn,
where your power is greatest, and where you
are most strongly bound by the ties of
gratitude
.
Think of my brother, as he merits to
be thought of. Hasten to reward him, for
those years of anguish which your
perverseness
has given him, and which have consumed
the best part of his life.
But how shall I gain an interview with
Hartley? I know not where he is. You say
that my draught has never been presented. It
must be so; since the money is still there, in
U
my own name. Some accident, perhaps, has
befallen him. He may not be alive to receive
the fruits of my repentance.
Set your heart at rest, replied my friend,
with a significant smile; he is well.
Indeed? You speak as if you had the means
of knowing. Surely, madam, you know nothing
of him.
I know enough of him. He is now in
New-York
,
in the same house with miss Howard.
In the same house? And....perhaps....
married
?
Fie upon you, Mary. Is this the courage
you have just avowed? To turn pale; to
faulter
,
at the mere possibility of what you have
so earnestly endeavoured to accomplish.
Forgive me. It was a momentary folly.
He is then....
married
.
No. They live under the same roof; but
it is nothing but a vague surmise that they will
ever be married.
Dear lady! By what means....
Through my brother's letters; which, if
you please to read them, will give you all the
information that I possess. Why that sudden
gravity? They will not taint your fingers, or
blast your sight. They are worthy of my
brother
,
and will depict, truly, that character
which you could not fail to love, if you were
but thoroughly acquainted with it.
This rebuke suppressed the objection which
I was going to raise against perusing these
letters. They were put into my hands. They
contained no information respecting Hartley,
but that he resided at New-York.
They contained chiefly, incidents and
reflections
relative to Sedley and to me. In this
respect they were copious. I read them often,
and found myself daily confirmed in the
resolutions
which I began to form. I need not
dwell upon the struggles which I occasionally
experienced, and those fits of profound
melancholy
into which I was still, sometimes,
plunged. I shall only say, that listening only
to the dictates of justice and gratitude, and to
the pathetic remonstrances of my friend, I
finally prevailed upon myself to consent to
her brother's wishes.
I should have written to Hartley,
informing
him of my destiny, but I proposed to
return
to Philadelphia, with Mrs Valentine, and
hoped to meet him there, or at New-York.
I was not unaware of the effects of an
interview
with him. My soul was tremulous with
doubt, and torn by conflicting emotions. I was
ready, in dreary moments, to revoke my
promise
to Sedley, to trust once more to some
kind chance that might make Hartley mine, or
to consecrate my life to mournful recollections
of my lost happiness. These were transient
moments, and the bitter tears which attended
them were soon dried up. I found
complacency
in the resolution to devote my life to
Sedley's happiness, and to the society of his
beloved sister.
Having arrived at New-York, I was told
of Hartley's absence, and learned that he was
then somewhere southward. I was informed
by Mrs. Etheridge, with whom Sedley made
me acquainted, of your general character. I
wanted to see you; to know you; to repose
my thoughts in your bosom; to be Hartley's
advocate with you; but I could not procure
sufficient courage to request an introduction
to you. A thousand scruples deterred me. I
thought, that to justify confidence and candour
on such delicate topics, much time and many
interviews would be necessary; but I could
not remain in New-York beyond a day.
I went to Mrs. Etheridge strangely
perplexed
.
Perhaps, I should have ventured to
beseech that lady's company to your house;
but the meeting that took place, on that
occasion
,
confused me beyond the possibility of
regaining composure. The superscription of
your letter added to my surprise, and made
me more willing to decline a meeting, since
this letter would guide me to the very spot
where Hartley was to be found.
I once more entered my native city.
Sedley
was prepared to meet and welcome me.
He was apprised of my intention as to Hartley,
and did not disapprove. He even wrote the
billet by which I invited your friend to come
to my lodgings.
My purpose was, to unfold the particulars
contained in this letter to Hartley, and to
introduce
my two friends to each other. In
answer
to my billet, I received a voluminous
pacquet, containing certain letters and
narratives
relative to him and to you.
How shall I describe my feelings on
perusing
them? They supply the place of a
thousand
U 2
conversations. They leave nothing to
be said. They take away every remnant of
hesitation. They inspire me with new virtue
and new joy. I am not grieved that Hartley
and his Clara are subjected to trials of their
magnanimity, since I foresee the propitious
issue of the trial. I am not grieved that the
happiness of Mary has been an object of such
value in your eyes, as to merit the sacrifice of
your own. I exult that my feelings are akin
to yours, and that it is in my power to vie with
you in generosity.
But Hartley's last letter gives me pain;
the more, because, in the tenor of yours, which
preceded it, there is an apparent harshness not,
perhaps, to be mistaken by an unimpassioned
reader, but liable to produce fallacious terrors
in an heart deeply enamoured. I see the
extent
of this error in him, but am consoled by
hoping that my reasoning, when we meet, or,
at least, that time, will dispel this unfriendly
cloud. I am impatient for his coming.
M. W.
LETTER XXVII.
TO MISS HOWARD.
Philadelphia
,
May
13.
My
friend, we have met, but such a
meeting!....
The letters had told me of his sickness,
but I expected not to behold a figure so wan,
so feeble, so decayed. I expected much
anxiety, much conflict in his features,
between
apprehension and hope; but not an
aspect so wild, so rueful, so melancholy. His
deportment and his words were equally
adverse
to my expectations.
After our first tears of congratulation were
exhausted, he exclaimed in a tone of unusual
vehemence:
Why, my friend, have you thus long
abandoned
me? You have been unjust to yourself
and to me, and I know not how to pardon you,
except on one condition.
What is that?
That we now meet to be united by the
strongest ties, and never to part more. On
that condition I forgive you.
I was prepared for this question; but the
tones and looks with which it was
accompanied
,
and especially its abruptness,
disconcerted
me. I was silent.
I came to this interview, resumed he, with
one determination. I will not tremble, or
repine, or upbraid, because my confidence in
the success of my efforts, is perfect, and not to
be shaken. I came to offer you the vows of
an husband. They are now offered, and
received
.
You have no power to decline them.
Let me then salute you as....my wife.
I shrunk back, and spread out my hand to
repulse him. I was still unable to speak.
I told you the purpose of my coming, said
he, in a solemn tone. This purpose is the
dearest to my heart. Of every other good I
am bereaved, but to the attainment of this
there can be no obstacle, but caprice, or
inhumanity
,
or folly, such as I never can impute
to you. If you love me, if you have regard
to my welfare, if you wish me to love, grant
me that good which is all that remains to
endear existence. If you refuse this gift, I
shall instantly vanish from society. I shall
undertake a journey, in which my life will be
exposed to numberless perils. If I pass them
in safety, I shall be dead to all the offices and
pleasures of civilized existence. I shall hasten
to embrute all my faculties. I shall make
myself
akin to savages and tygers, and forget
that I once was a man.
This is no incoherent intimation. It is
the fixed purpose of my soul, to be changed
only by your consenting to be mine. Ponder
well on the consequences of a refusal. It
decides
my everlasting destiny.
Have you not read my letter? Have I not
read yours and Clara's? How then can you
expect my concurrence? Have you not
anticipated
my refusal?
I anticipated misery. Having found
injustice
and a callous heart in another, where
I least expected to find them, I was prone, in
the bitterness of disappointment, to ascribe
them to every human creature; but that was
rash and absurd. Mary cannot be unjust.
To whom do you impute an hard heart?
Not to you. You merit not the
imputation
.
You will prove yourself compassionate
and good. You will not scorn me; cast me
off; drive me into hopeless exile, and
inextricable
perils. You are too good, and have been
too long my friend; the partaker of my cares;
the solace of my being; the rewarder of my
tenderness. You will not reject me, banish
me, kill me.
You know not what you say. Your thoughts
are confused. You love and are beloved by
another; by one who merits your eternal
devotion
and gratitude. They are due to her,
and never will I rob her of them.
What mean you. Did not you say you
had read the pacquets? and do not these
inform
you that I have no place in the affections
of any human being but yourself? Convince
me that I have, indeed, a place in yours; that
I am not utterly deserted. Consent to be
mine own, my beloved wife, and thus make
me as happy as my fate will permit.
Alas, my friend! you are not in your right
mind. Disappointment has injured your
reason
,
or you could never solicit me thus; you
could never charge Clara Howard with a hard
heart.
Talk not of Clara Howard. Talk only of
yourself and of me. Rid me of suspense and
anxiety, by consenting to my wishes. Make
me happy. Take away, at least, the largest
portion of my misery, by your consent. Will
you not be mine?
Never. Former objections time has
rendered
more strong; but your letters would
have fixed my resolutions, had they wavered.
These shew how far the happiness of miss
Howard and your own depend upon my
perseverence
;
and persevere I must.
What mean you? Miss Howard's
happiness
,
say you, depends upon your incompliance
with her wishes? on your rejecting the prayers
she has made, with the utmost degree of
earnestness
?
They are generous prayers, which suppose
me weaker and more infatuated than I am.
They are prayers which counteract their own
purpose, since they exhibit an example of
disinterestedness and self-oblivion, which I
cannot fail to admire and to imitate. Our
cases are, indeed, not parallel. Her love for
you is answered and returned by equal love.
To me your heart is indifferent, and I have
resolved to conquer my perverse affections, or
perish.
You have read her letters, her last letter,
and yet you talk of her love! Once, I grant,
it might have been, it was so, but that time
of affability, of softness, of yielding, is gone.
She is now rugged, austere, unfeeling. Her
preposterous abstractions and refinements have
gained force through the coldness of her heart.
There is no self-sacrifice, for she loves me not.
There is no regard for my welfare or felicity,
for she loves me not.
O, Edward! can you be so perverse; so
unjust? You merit not the love of so pure a
spirit. You merit not the happiness which
such an one is qualified to give you. But
your disappointment has disturbed your
reason
.
I can pity and forgive you, and will
intercede with her for your forgiveness. I see
her merits and her superior claims too clearly,
ever to consent to your separation.
X
You are discomposed, I continued. Surely
you have been very sick. You seem to have
just risen from the grave; you are so pale;
so wan; so feeble. Your state of health has
made you unfit to judge truly of the motives
of your friend, and to adopt her magnanimity.
If you will have patience I can convince you
that it is my duty to reject your offers, and
that Clara Howard may still, if you please, be
yours.
Then, replied he, you do reject them?
Do not look so wildly. I am sure, you are
not well. You seem ready to sink upon the
floor. You are cold,
very
cold. Let us defer
this conversation a little while. I have much
to say on the subject of my history, since we
parted. That being known to you, you will see
reason to judge differently of my motives in
rejecting
your offers. Instead of making that
rejection more difficult by importunity and
vehemence, you will see the justice of
concurring
with me, and of strengthening my
resolution
.
Impossible, said he, that any thing has
happened to change my views. Are not your
affections, merits, and integrity, the same as
formerly? Answer me sincerely.
I will. I have no reason for concealment.
Time has not lessened my merits, it is true,
but....
That assurance is enough for me. I will
eagerly listen to your story, but not until my
fate is decided. Have pity on that sinking
frame, and that wounded heart which you
behold
.
There is but one cure, and that is
deposited
in your hands. To every other my
joy or sorrow; my life or death, is indifferent.
Will you take me to your bosom; shall my
image be fostered, and my soul find peace there;
or shall I cast myself upon a sea of storms
and perils, and vanish from this scene forever?
How you grieve me! I beseech you be not
so impetuous. Listen to my story first, and
then say in what manner I ought to act.
There is no room for delay. Say you will
be mine, and then I shall enjoy repose. I shall
be able to listen. Till then I am stretched
upon the rack. Answer me; will you be mine?
O no! I replied; while I have an heart not
wholly sordid and selfish, I cannot consent.
My conscience will not let me.
Find consolation, he answered, in the
approbations
of that conscience, for a sentence
that has ratified the doom of one who deserved
differently from you. I perceive you are
inflexible
,
and will therefore leave you.
But whither are you going? Will you not
return to Clara?
To Clara! No. Far different is the path
that I am to tread. I shall never see her
more.
He now moved towards the door, as if
going
.
Edward! what can you mean? Stay. Do not
go till you have heard me further. I entreat
you, as you value my peace, and my life, hear
me further.
Will you then consent? said he, returning
with a more cheerful brow. How good you
are! The same dear girl; the same angelic
benignity as formerly. Confirm my happiness
by new assurances. Confirm it by permitting
this embrace.
I was compelled to avert my face; to
repulse
him from my arms. To what unlooked
for trials have you subjected me! But I must
not retract my resolutions. No, Edward, the
bar between us is insuperable. I must never
be yours.
Never!....never!....be mine!....Well, may
the arms of a protecting Providence encircle
thee! May some other rise to claim and
possess
thy love! May ye never, neither thou nor
Clara, know remorse for your treatment to
me!....Saying this, he snatched his hat from
the table, and ran out of the house. I called,
but he was gone beyond my hearing.
I was justly alarmed by this frantic
demeanour
.
I knew not how to account for it,
but by imagining that some remains of
delirium
still afflicted his understanding. I related
this conversation to Sedley. I entreated him
to pursue Edward to his lodgings, to prevail
upon him to return hither, or to calm his mind,
by relating what his abrupt departure had
prevented
me from saying.
Sedley cheerfully complied with my
request
,
but Hartley was not to be found at his
lodging. He waited his return till ten, eleven,
and twelve o'clock, but in vain.
Meanwhile, I found some relief in
imagining
they had met; that Sedley's address and
benevolence had succeeded in restoring our
X 2
friend to better thoughts. My disappointment
and alarm, at his return, on hearing that
Hartley
had not been met with, were inexpressible.
That night passed away without repose. Early
in the morning, I again entreated Sedley to go
in search of the fugitive. He went, but
presently
returned to inform me that Hartley had
set out, in the stage for Baltimore, at
day-dawn
.
I cannot comprehend his intimations of a
journey to the wilderness; of embruting his
faculties; of exposing his humanity, his life, to
hazard. Could he have interpreted your
letters
into avowals of hatred or scorn, or even
of indifference? One, indeed, who knew you
less perfectly, might impute to you a rigour in
judging; a sternness not suitable to the merits
of this youth. Your letters are void of that
extenuating spirit, that reluctance to inflict
sufferings, which, perhaps, the wisest
inflexibility
will not be slow to feel, or unwilling to
express....but Edward had sufficient
knowledge
to save him from a wrong construction.
Yet that, alas! is not true. He ought to
have had that knowledge....but it was wanting.
Possibly he has not told you his designs.
He cannot inform you of the truth with
respect
to me. My present situation should be
known to you, to enable you to act with
propriety
.
I shall not prescribe to you. I am not
mistress of your thoughts and motives. May
heaven direct you right.
A friend will go to Baltimore on Tuesday,
time enough for you to receive this, and to
write to Hartley. If sent to me, I will intrust
it to my friend. I have not time to add a
word more.
Accept the reverence and love of
Mary
.
LETTER XXVIII.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,
May
15.
Hartley
! how shall I address you!
In terms of indignation or of kindness? Shall
I entreat you to return, or exhort you to obey
the wild dictates of your caprice? Shall I leave
you to your froward destiny, and seek, in the
prospect of a better world, a relief from the
keen distress, the humiliating sorrows of this
scene of weakness and error?
Shall I link my fate with one who is deaf
to the most pathetic calls of his duty? Who
forgets or spurns the most urgent obligations
of gratitude? Whom the charms of nature,
the attractions of science, the claims of
helpless
and fond sisters, who trust for shelter, for
bread, for safety from contempt and servitude
and vice, to his protection, his counsel, his
presence, cannot detain from forests and wilds,
where inevitable death awaits him?
Shall I bestow one drop of tender
remembrance
on him who upbraids and contemns
me for sacrificing every selfish regard to his
dignity; for stifling in my bosom, that ignoble
passion, which makes us trample on the claims
of others; which seeks its own gratification
at the price of humanity and justice; which
can smile in the midst of repinings and despair,
of creatures no less worthy, no less susceptible
of good?
You say that I love you not. Till this
moment
your assertion was untrue. My heart
was not free, till
these
proofs of your
infatuation
and your folly were set before me. Till
now, I was willing to account you not
unworthy
.
I hoped that time and my efforts, would
reclaim you to some sense of equity and
reason
.
But now....must I then deem you utterly
lost? Have you committed this last and
irretrievable
act? O no! it was surely but a
momentary
madness. The fit will be past before
this letter reaches you. You will have opened
your eyes to the cowardice, the ignominy, the
guilt of this flight. You will hasten to close
those wounds which have rent my heart.
You will return to me with the speed of the
wind, and make me, by the rectitude of your
future conduct, forget that you have ever
erred.
Has it come to this! now, that the
impediment
has vanished, that my feelings may be
indulged at the cost of no one's peace; now
that the duty which once so sternly forbad me
to be yours, not only permits, but enjoins me
to link together our fates; that the sweet
voice of an approving conscience is ready to
sanction and applaud every impulse of my
heart, and make the offices of tenderness not
only free from guilt, but coincident with every
duty; that now....
Edward! let me hope that thou hast
hesitated
,
doubted, lingered in thy fatal career.
Let me foster this hope, that I may retain life.
My fortitude, alas! is unequal to this test. No
disaster should bereave me of serenity and
courage; but to this, while I despise myself
for yielding, I must yield. If this letter do
not reach thee; if it fill not thy heart with
remorse
,
thy eyes with tenderness; if it cure
thee not of thy phrenzy, and bring thee not
back....
It must....it will.

LETTER XXIX.
TO E. HARTLEY.
Philadelphia
,
May
15.
What
has become of that fortitude, my
friend, which I was once accustomed to
admire
in you. You used to be circumspect,
sedate, cautious; not precipitate in judging
or resolving. What has become of all these
virtues?
Why would you not give your poor friend
a patient hearing? Why not hesitate a
moment
,
before you plunged all whom you love
into sorrow and distress? Was it impossible
for six months of reflection to restore the
strength of my mind, to introduce wiser
resolutions
and more cheerful thoughts, than those
with which I parted from you?
I was then sick. My lonely situation, the
racking fears your long silence had produced,
a dreary and lowering sky, and the tidings
your letter conveyed, of my return again to
that indigence so much detested by my pride,
were surely enough to sink me deeply in
despondency
;
to make me, at the same time,
desire and expect my death.
I saw the bright destiny that was reserved
for you. My life, I thought, stood in the way
of your felicity. I knew your impetuous
generosity
,
your bewitching eloquence. I knew
the frailty of my own heart. Hence my firm
resolve to shun an interview with you, to see
you no more, at least, till your destiny had
been accomplished.
Happy was the hour in which I formed this
resolution. By it I have not only secured that
indirect happiness, arising from the
contemplation
of yours, but the ineffable bliss of
requiting
that love, of which my heart was so
long insensible.
Yes, my friend, the place that you once
possessed in my affections, is now occupied by
another. By him, of whose claims I know you
Y
have always been the secret advocate; by that
good, wise, and generous man, whom I always
admitted to be second to yourself, but for
whom my heart now acknowledges a
preference
.
Had you waited for an explanation of my
sentiments, you would have saved me, your
beloved Clara, yourself, and all your friends,
the anxieties your present absence has
produced
.
That rashness may excite remorse,
but it cannot be recalled. Let it then be
speedily
forgotten, and let this letter put a stop
to your flight.
Dear Edward! come back. All the
addition
of which my present happiness is capable,
must come from you. The heart-felt
approbation
,
the sweet ineffable complacensy with
which my present feelings are attended, want
nothing to merit the name of perfect happiness,
but to be witnessed and applauded by you.
Your Clara, that noblest of women, joins
me in recalling you, and is as eager to do
justice
to
your
passion, as
I
am to recompence
the merits of Sedley. Therefore, my friend,
if you value my happiness or Clara's, come
back. Will you not obey the well known
voice, calling you to virtue and felicity, of
Your sister
Mary
.
LETTER XXX.
TO CLARA HOWARD.
Wilmington
,
May
17.
I have
received and have read your
letter. To say thus much is enough. From
what a depth of humiliation and horror have I
emerged! How quickly was I posting to my
ignominy and my ruin? Your letter overtook
me at this place, where a benignant fate
decreed
that I should be detained by sickness.
Clara, thou hast judged truly. My eyes are
open on my folly, and my infatuation. The
mists that obscured my sight, are gone; I am
once more a reasonable creature.
How shall I atone for my past misconduct,
or compensate thee, my heavenly monitor, for
the disquiet which thou hast endured for my
sake? By hasting to thy feet, and pouring out
before thee the tears of my repentance? Thy
forgiveness is all that I dare claim. Thy
tenderness
I do not merit. Years of service and
self-denial, are requisite to qualify me for
receiving
that best gift.
Your letter, with one from Mary, were left
upon my pillow, by a traveller, passing
through this town to Baltimore. I had
swallowed
laudanum, to secure me some sleep,
on the night of my arrival hither. I was
unable
to proceed further, my mind and body
being equally distempered. After a perturbed
sleep, I awoke before the light, and lifting
my head from the pillow, to acquaint myself
with my situation, I perceived, by the light
of a candle on the hearth, a pacquet lying
beside
me. I snatched it with eagerness, and
found enclosed, thy letter, and one from
Mary.
For a time, I imagined myself still
dreaming
.
The contents of each letter so far
surpassed
and deceived every expectation, every
wish, that I had formed; such pure and
unmerited
felicity was offered me, and by means
Y 2
so abrupt and inexplicable, that I might well
hesitate to believe it real.
Next morning, on inquiry, I discovered
that a midnight coach had arrived, in which
a traveller, chancing to hear of my condition,
and my name, entered my apartment while I
slept, and left this pacquet, which, as I saw,
was intended to have been conveyed to
Baltimore
.
My fever, though violent, proved to be
merely an intermittent. By noon this day,
though feeble and languid, I was freed from
disease; I am also free from anxiety. The
purest delight thrills in my bosom; mixed,
now and then, and giving place to
compunction
for the folly of my late schemes. In
truth, I have been sick. Since the perusal
of thy letter by Mary, I have been half crazy,
shivering and glowing by turns; bereft of
appetite
,
and restless. Every object was tinged
with melancholy hues.
But I shall not try to extenuate my fault.
May thy smiles, my beloved Clara, and thy
voice, musical and thrilling as it used to be,
disperse every disquiet. No time shall be
lost in returning to thee. My utmost haste
will not enable me to offer thee, before
Tuesday
morning, the hand and heart of
E. H.
LETTER XXXI.
TO E. HARTLEY.
New-York
,
May
19.
You
are coming, my friend. I shall chide
you and thank you, in the same breath, for
your haste. I hope you will incur no injury
by a journey at night. Knowing that you
mean not to lay by, I am unable to go to bed.
The air was blustering in the evening, and
now, at midnight, it blows a storm. It is not
very cold, but an heavy rain is falling. I sit by
my chamber-fire, occupied in little else than
listening to it, and my heart droops, or gains
courage, according to the pauses or increases
of the wind and rain.
Would to Heaven thou hadst not this
boisterous river to cross. It is said to be
somewhat
dangerous, in an high wind. This is a
land of evils; the transitions of the seasons
are so quick, and into such extremes. How
different from the pictures which our fancy
drew in our native land?
This wind and rain! How will you endure
them in your crazy vehicle, thumping over
rocks, and sinking into hollows? I wish you
had not been in such haste. Twenty hours
sooner or later, would be of no moment. And
this river!.... To cross it at any time, is full
of danger; what must it be at night, and in a
storm? Your adventurous spirit will never
linger on the opposite shore till day dawns,
and the wind has died away.
But well know I the dangers and toils of a
midnight journey, in a stage-coach, in
America
.
The roads are kneedeep in mire, winding
through crags and pits, while the wheels groan
and totter, and the curtains and roof admit the
wet at a thousand seams.
It is
three
, and the day will soon come.
How I long to see thee, my poor friend!
Having once met, never, I promise thee, will
we part more. This heart, with whose
treasures
thou art imperfectly acquainted, will
pour all its sorrows and joys into thy honest
bosom. My maturer age and more cautious
judgment shall be counsellers and guides to
thy inexperienced youth. While I love thee
and cherish thee as a wife, I shall assume some
of the perogatives of an elder sister, and put
my circumspection and forethought in the
balance against thy headlong confidence.
I revere thy genius and thy knowledge.
With the improvements of time, very far wilt
thou surpass the humble Clara; but in moral
discernment, much art thou still deficient.
Here I claim to be more than equal, but the
difference shall not subsist long. Our modes
of judging and our maxims, shall be the same;
and this resemblance shall be purchased at
the cost of all my patience, my skill and my
love.
Alas! this rain is heavy! The gale
whistles
more loudly than ever. Would to heaven
thou wast safely seated near me, at this quiet
fire-side!
LETTER XXXII.
TO MARY WILMOT.
New-York,
May
21.
Rejoice
with me, my friend. Hartley
is arrived, and has been little incommoded by
his journey. He has brought with him your
letter. Will you pardon me for omitting to
answer it immediately, and as fully as it
deserves
?
As soon as the tumults of my joy
settles down into calm, unruffled felicity, I
will comment upon every sentence. At
present
,
I must devote myself to console this
good lad for his sufferings, incurred, as he
presumes to say, entirely on my account.
And so you have deferred the happiness
of your Sedley for a whole month. I wonder
he has any patience with you; but he that has
endured, without much discontent, the delay
of six or eight years (is it not so long?) ought
to be ashamed of his impatience at a new delay
of a few weeks.
Dear Mary, shall I tell you a secret? If
you add one week of probation to the four
already decreed, it is, by no means,
impossible
,
that the same day may witness the
happiness
of both of us. May that day, whenever
it shall come, prove the beginning of joy to
Mary, and to her who, in every state, will be
your affectionate
Clara
.
THE END.TO EDWARD HARTLEY.
Abingdon
,
Nov. 11.
I need
not tell you, my friend, what I
have felt, in consequence of your silence. The
short note which I received, a fortnight after
you had left me, roused my curiosity and my
fears, instead of allaying them. You promised
me a longer account of some mysterious
changes that had taken place in your condition.
This I was to receive in a few days. At the
end of a week I was impatient. The promised
letter did not arrive. Four weeks passed away,
and nothing came from you.
Your pacquet has at last put an end to
suspense
:
But why did you not send it sooner?
B
Why not send me your story piece-meal; or,
at least, tell me, in half a line, how you were
employed, and what occasioned your delay?
Why did you not come yourself? Edward, I
am
displeased;
I was going to say,
angry
with
you. You have sported with my feelings. I
ought to lay down my pen while I am in this
humour. The pangs your negligence has given
me, have not yet been soothed to rest, and
when I find that so much unhappiness has been
given through mere heedlessness, I can scarcely
keep my patience.
I was sitting on a bench in the garden, when
a country lad entered the enclosure. As soon
as I caught a glimpse of him, and observed
that his attention was fixed upon me, and his
right hand already in his pocket, my heart
whispered
that this was the bearer of tidings from
you. I attempted to rise and meet him, but
my knees trembled so much, that I was obliged
to give up my design. He drew forth his
pacquet
and threw it into my lap, answering, at the
same time, my inquiries, respecting you, by
telling me that you were well, and that you
had been busy, for a long time, night and day,
in writing that
there
letter to me. He had stopt
a moment to give it, and could not stay, but
merely to receive three lines from me,
informing
you of my health.
You do not deserve the favour. Besides,
my fingers partake the flutterings of my heart.
A tumult of joy and vexation, overpowers me.
But, though you do not merit it, you shall
have a few lines. This paper was spread upon
my lap, and I had taken the pen to write to my
aunt Bowles, but I will devote it to you, though
my tremors, you see, will scarcely permit me
to write legibly.
Your messenger chides my lingering; and
I will let him go with nothing but a verbal
message, for on second thoughts, I will defer
writing till I have read your long letter.
Nov. 15.
Yes; the narrative of Morton is true. The
simple recital which you give, leaves me no
doubt. The money is his, and shall be restored
the moment he demands it. For what I have
spent, I must a little while be his debtor. This
he must consent to lose, for I never can repay
it. Indeed, it is not much. Since my change
of fortune, I have not been extravagant. An
hundred dollars is the most that I have laid
out, and some of this has been in furniture
which I shall resign to him.
Be under no concern, my friend, on my
account. Think not how I shall endure the
evils of my former condition, for I never shall
return to it. Thy Mary is hastening to the
grave, with a very quick pace. That is her only
refuge from humiliation and calamity, and to
that she looks forward with more confidence
than ever.
I was not fashioned of stubborn materials.
Poverty, contempt, and labour, are a burden
too great for me. I know, that for these only,
am I reserved, and this interval of better
prospects
was no comfort to me. I always told you
my brother had no just claim to this money,
and that the rightful claimant would sooner or
later appear. You were more sanguine, and
were willing to incur, even on grounds so
imperfect
,
the irrevocable obligations of
marriage
.
See into what a gulf your rashness would
have hurried you, and rejoice that my obstinacy
insisted on a delay of half a year.
You know my motives for accepting, and
on what conditions I accepted your proffered
vows. I have never concealed from you my
love. What my penetration easily perceived,
your candour never strove to conceal. Your
indifference, your freedom from every thing
like passion, was not only to be seen in your
conduct, but was avowed by your lips. I was
not so base as to accept your hand, without
your heart. You talked of gratitude, and duty,
and perfect esteem. I obtained, you told me,
your entire reverence, and there was no female
in the world whom you loved
so much
. It was
true that you did not love
me
, but you
preferred
me to all other women. Union with me was
your supreme desire. Your reason discerned
and adored my merits, and the concurrence of
the heart could not but follow.
Fondly devoted to you as I was, and urged
as these arguments were, with pathetic
eloquence
,
I could not be deceived for more than
a moment. My heart was filled with
contradictory
emotions. I secretly upbraided you for
obduracy in withholding your love, while I,
at the same time, admired and loved you the
more for your generosity. Your conduct
rendered
the sacrifice of my happiness to yours
the more difficult, while it increased the
necessity
,
B 2
and inforced the justice of that sacrifice.
I could not discover the probability, that
marriage
would give birth to that love which
previous
tenderness and kindness had been unable
to produce. I doubted not your fidelity, and
that the consciousness of conferring happiness
would secure your contentment; but I felt that
this was insufficient for my pride, if not for
my love.
I sought your happiness. To be the author
of it was the object of inexpressible longings.
To be happy without you was impossible, but
the misery of loneliness, however great, was
less than that of being the spectator of your
misery, or even that of defrauding you of the
felicity, attending marriage with a woman
whom you could truly love. Meanwhile, our
mutual poverty was itself an insurmountable
bar to marriage.
My brother's death put me in seeming
possession
of competence. Circumstances were
now somewhat changed. If no claimant
appeared
,
I should be able, by giving myself to
you, to bestow upon the object of my love that
good, the want of which nothing can
compensate
.
There were no other means of rescuing
your sisters and yourself from indigence and
dependence. What I was willing to share with
you, you would not share with me on any
terms but those of wedlock.
Too well did I see on what weak
foundations
was built this scheme of happiness. This
property was never gained by my brother's own
industry, and how could I apply to my own use
what I could not doubt belonged to another,
though that other should never appear to claim
it at my hands.
My reluctance was partly subdued by your
urgency. I consented, waveringly, and with a
thousand misgivings, to be yours at the end of
six months, if no one should appear, meantime,
to make out a good title to this money. I
listened to your arguments and suppositions,
by which you would fain account for my
brother's acquisition of so large a sum
consistently
with honesty, and for his silence as to his
possession of it. I was willing to be convinced,
and consented to sacrifice my peace by
marrying
the man I loved, because this marriage
would secure to him the competence, which I
could not enjoy alone.
This end cannot now be effected. New
reasons have sprung up for foregoing your
affection, even had Morton perished at sea. A
friend has returned to you, who is far more
able to relieve your poverty than I should be.
It is easy to see on what conditions this relief
is intended to be given. He has a daughter,
whom he deems worthy of his adopted son. He
knows your merit, and cannot fail of perceiving
that it places you on a level with the most lovely
and accomplished of human beings.
I see how it is. This Clara will be yours.
That intelligence, that mien, that gracefulness,
which rustic obscurity cannot hide, which the
garb of a clown could never disguise,
accompanied
with the ardent commendations of her
father, will fascinate her in a moment. I cannot
hesitate what to wish, or how to act. That
passion
which a form, homely and uncouth like
mine, tarnished and withered by drudgery and
sorrow, and by comparative old age, for I am
nine years older than you; which a mind, void
of education, and the refinements of learned
and polished intercourse was incapable of
wakening
,
cannot fail to be excited by the youth
and beauty, the varied accomplishments and
ineffable graces of this stranger. She will offer
you happiness, and wealth, and honour, and
you will accept them at her hands.
As for me, I cannot be yours, because I am
not my own. My resolution to be severed from
you is unalterable; but this is not necessary to
insure our separation. It cannot take place,
even if all my wishes were in favour of it.
Long before the expiration of the half year, I
shall be removed beyond your reach. This is
not the illusion of despair. I feel in my deepest
vitals, the progress of death. Nature languishes
within me, and every hour accelerates my
decay.
My friend, thou must not parley with me;
thou must not afflict me with arguments or
intreaties
,
by letters or visits. I must see thee,
and hear from thee no more: but I know thy
character too well to expect this from thee.
As soon as thou receivest this letter, thou wilt
hasten hither, and endeavour to shake my
purpose
.
I am not doubtful of my own constancy,
but I would save myself and thee from a trial
that will answer no end. I shall leave this place
early to-morrow. Whither I am going must
never be told to thee. Thy pursuit and thy
inquiries will be incessant and anxious, but the
measures I have taken for eluding thy search,
will defeat all thy efforts. I know that these
assurances will not dissuade thee from making
them, and I sorrow to reflect on the labours
and anxieties to which thou wilt subject
thyself
for my sake; but I shall derive consolation
from the belief, that my retreat will
never be
discovered
.
I enclose an order on the bank for the
money
that remains in it, drawn in favour of
Morton, and an assignment to him of the few
tables and chairs that furnish my lodgings here.
These thou wilt faithfully deliver into his
hands. I likewise return you your papers and
letters.
And now....Edward....best and most
beloved
of men!....and is it come to this? Must I
bid thee farewel forever?
Do not, I beseech thee, think hardly of me
for what I have done. Nothing but a sense of
duty, nothing but a supreme regard to thy
happiness
,
could suggest my design. I cannot
faulter in the execution, since I could not
waver in the sense of my duty. I am ashamed
of my weakness, that hinders me from
pronouncing
my last farewel.
Make haste to forget the unhappy Mary;
make haste to the feet of your new friend, and
to secure that felicity which an untoward fate
denied me the power of bestowing.
My friend, my benefactor, farewel.

I shall
not call on you at Hatfield. I
am weary of traversing hills and dales; and
my detention in Virginia being longer than I
expected, shall go on board a vessel in this

accommodation of the girls, and repair to
New-York as soon as possible. Search out
No......., Broadway. If I am not there to

you, inquire for my wife or niece, and
