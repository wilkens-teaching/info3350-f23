LETTER I.
Original State of the
Forest
.The
Adventures
of
Walter Pipeweed
,
and
Cecilius Peterson
.
DEAR SIR,
To
perform the
promise
which
I made to you before I began my journey,
I will give you
such
an account of this,
once
forest
, but now cultivated and
pleasant
country, as I can collect from my
conversation
with its inhabitants, and
from the
perusal
of their old family
papers
,
which they have kindly
permitted
me to look into for my
entertainment
.
By
these
means I have
acquainted
myself
with the
story
of their
first
planting,
consequent
improvements and
present
state
; the recital of which will
occupy the hours which I
shall
be able to
spare
from
business
, company and
sleep
,
during my
residence
among them.
In
reading the character of
John Bull
,
which was committed to paper
some
years
ago by one who knew him well, you
must
have
observed
, that though he was in
the main an
honest
, plain dealing fellow,
yet he was choleric and
inconstant
, and
very apt to
quarrel with his
best
friends
.
This
observation
you will find fully
verified
in the
course
of the narrative; and
as the opinions and manners of
superiors
have a very great influence in forming the
character of inferiors, you need not be
surprised
if you find a family
likeness
prevailing among the
persons
whose
history
I am about to recite,
most
, of whom
A 2
were formerly
residents
in Mr. Bull's
house
, or apprentices in his
shop
.
There
was among the appendages to
John's
estate
, a pretty large tract of land,
which had been neglected by his
ancestors
,
and which he never cared much
about
,
excepting that now and then
some
of his family went thither a hunting, and
brought home
venison
and furs. Indeed
this was as far as I can find the
best
pretence
that John had to call the land his;
for he had no legal title to it. It was
then a very woody country, in
some
parts
rocky and hilly, in other parts level; well
watered with brooks and ponds, and the
whole of it bordered on a large lake, in
which were plenty of
fish
,
some
of which
were often
served
up at John's table, on
fast
days.
The
stories
told by one and another of
these
adventurers, had made a deep im
pression
on the mind of
Walter Pipeweed
,
[1]
[1]
Sir Walter Raleigh.
one of John's
domestics
, a fellow of a
roving
and projecting
disposition
, and who
had learned the art of
surveying
. Walter
having frequently
listened
to their chat,
began to think within
himself
, If
these
fellows make
so
many pence by their
excursions
to this wild
spot
, what might not
I gain by
sitting
down upon it? There is
plenty of game and
fish
at hand, for a
present
supply
; plenty of nuts and acorns
to fatten pigs, and with
some
small
labour
I may be able to
raise
corn and feed
poultry, which will fetch me a good price
at market.I can carry
bisket
enough in
my pockets, to keep me alive till my
first
crop comes in, and my dog can live upon
the offals of the game that I
shall
kill.
Besides
, who knows what
treasures
the
land
itself
may containperhaps
some
rich mines!
od zounds!then I am
made for this world.
Full
of this dream, Walter applied to
his
master
one day for a
lease
of part of
the
forest
, as it was called. Bull at
first
laughed at the
proposal
, and put him off;
but Walter followed it up
so
close
, and
told what advantages might be gained by
settling
there, and
promised
, if he
should
succeed
, to turn all his trade into his
master's
hand, and give him the
refusal
of
whatever he might bring to market, and
withal
shewed
him
some
draughts, which
he had made with chalk, from the reports
of the
huntsmen
, that Bull began to think
of the matter in good
earnest
, and
consulted
his lawyer upon the
subject
, who,
after due confideration of the
premises
,
and
stroking
his band,
advised
him as
follows. Why yes, Mr. Bull, I don't
see
why you ought not to look about you
as well as your neighbours. You know
that old
Lord Peter
lays claim to the
whole country, and has
assumed
to parcel
it out among his devotees. He has given
all the
western
part of it, where this
forest
lies, to
Lord Strut
, and he has a large
manor adjoining to your
forest
, which,
they
say
, yields him a fine rent, and who
knows but this may bring you in as much,
or more?Then there is old
Lewis
, the
cudgel player, and
Nic Frog
, the draper,
who have, perhaps, (I
say
perhaps
, Mr.
Bull,
because
there may be a little doubt
on both
sides
, and in that
case
, you know
sir
, it would not become gentlemen of our
cloth, to
speak
positively
) as good a claim
as your honor to this land; but then it is
a maxim, you know, that
possession
is
eleven
points of the law, and if you once
get your foot upon it, they cannot
oust
you without a
process
, and your honor
knows that your
purse
is as long as theirs,
and you are as able to
stand
a
suit
with
them as they are with you. I therefore
advise
you to humour your man Walter,
and give him a
lease
, and a pretty large
oneyou may find more advantages in it
than you are aware ofbut
lease
it,
lease
it at any rate. Upon this he was
ordered
to make out a
lease
; and Walter
being
thus
invested
with as good authority
as could be obtained, filled his pockets
with bread and
cheese
, took his gun,
powder
flask
, and
shot
of various kinds,
with a parcel of
fishing
lines and hooks,
his
surveying
instruments
, and a bag of
corn on his
shoulders
, and off he trotted
to his new
paradise
.
It
was
some
time before he could fix
upon a
spot
to his liking, and he at
first
met with
some
opposition
from the bears
and wolves, and was greatly
exposed
to
the weather, before he could build him a
hut; once or twice the
savage
animals had
almost
devoured him, but being made of
good
stuff
, he
stood
his ground, cleared a
little
spot
, put his
seed
into the earth, and
lived as well as
such
adventurers can
expect
,
poorly enough at
first
, but
supported
as all new planters are, by the hope of
better times. After a while he began to
thrive, and his
master
Bull recommended
a
wife
,
[2]
[2]
The charter of Virginia.
whom he married, and by whom
he had a number of children. Having
found a new
sort
of grain in the
forest
,
and a certain plant of a narcotic quality,
he cultivated both, and having procured
a number of
black cattle
, he went on pretty
gaily in the planting way, and brought
his narcotic weed into great repute, by
sending
a
present
of a quantity of it to his
old
master
, who grew
excessively
fond of it,
and kept calling for more, till he got the
whole trade of it into his own hands, and
sold
it out of his own ware
house
to old
Lewis, Nic Frog, and all the other
tradesmen
around him. In return he
supplied
Walter with cloths and
stuffs
for his
family
,
and
utensils
for his
husbandry
; and
as a reward for being the
first
, who had
courage to make a
settlement
in his
forest
,
and in token of his high
esteem
of him as
a
customer
, as well as for certain other
reasons
, he made it a practice every year,
to
present
him with a waggon load of or
dure,
[3]
[3]
Convicts.
the
sweepings
of his back yard, the
scrapings
of his dog kennel, and contents
of his own water
closet
. This was a mark
of
politeness
which John valued
himself
much upon. It may
seem
odd (
said
he one day to a friend) that I make
such
a kind of compliment as this to my good
customer
; but if you
consider
it aright
you will find it a piece of refined policy
for by this means I get rid of a deal of
trash
and
rubbish
that is
necessarily
made
in
such
a family as mine; I get a
cursed
stink
removed from under my
nose
, and
my good friend has the advantage of it
upon his farm, to manure his grounds,
and make them produce more plentifully
that precious weed in which we all
so
much delight. Walter was often
seen
,
on the arrival of Bull's waggon, to clap
his handerchief to his
nose
; but as he
knew his old
master
was an odd
sort
of a
fellow, and it was his
interest
to keep in
with him, he generally turned off the
compliment with a laugh,
saying
, good
naturedly enough, Let him laugh that
wins, without explaining his meaning,
though it might admit of a
double
entendre
and
calling
some
of his
servants
, he
ordered them to
shovel
out the dung, and
make his black cattle mix theirs with it
and when
spread
over the land, the air
took out
most
of the
scent
, and the
salts
were of
some
advantage to the
soil
.
After
Walter Pipeweed had got his
affairs into tolerable order, he was
visited
in his retirement by
Cecilius
Peterson
,
[4]
[4]
Calvert, Lord Baltimore, who
first
settled
Maryland
,
was a
Papist
; his
successors

and conformed to the Church of England.
another
of Bull's apprentices, who had
taken a fancy to the
same
kind of life,
from a
disgust
to
some
things that had
happened in the family. He had not
been long with Walter before he found
it would not do for him to remain there.
Peterson
was
supposed
to be a natural
son
B
of old
Lord Peter
, after whom he was
nick named. He had the
same
affected
airs, and a tincture of the high flying
notions
of his reputed father.
These
made
him rather
disgustful
to Walter, who had
learned his manners of Mr. Bull's mother,
when
she
was in her
sober
senses
, and
between
her and Lord Peter there had been
a long variance. When
Peterson
perceived
that his company was not
desired
,
he had
so
much good
sense
as to leave
Walter's plantation, and paddling
across
a creek,
seated
himself
on a point of land
that ran out into the lake. Of this he
obtained
a
lease
of his old
master
, and went
to work in the
same
manner as Walter had
done, who, liking his company
best
at a
distance
, was willing to
supply
him with
bread and meat till he could
scramble
for
himself
. Here he took to
husbandry
,
raising
corn and the narcotic weed, and
buying up
black cattle
, and after a while
turned his produce into his old
master
's
ware
house
, and received from him the
annual compliment of a waggon load of
dung, excepting that when there had not
been
so
much as
usual
made, he and
Walter
were to
share
a load between them.
To ingratiate
himself
still
farther with
his old
master
, he accepted of a girl out
of his family for a wife, (for John was
always
fond of his tenants marrying for fear
of their doing
worse
) he took as little
notice
as
possible
of his reputed father, and
dropping, or
disowning
his nick name of
Peterson
, he
assumed
that of
Marygold
,
which old Madam Bull
understood
as a
compliment to one of her daughters. He
also
made his court to the old lady by
kneeling down and
kissing
the fringe of
her embroidered petticoat, as was the
fashion
of that day. This ceremony,
though a trifle in
itself
, helped much to
recommend him to Mr. Bull, who was a
very dutiful
son
, and took his mother's
advice in
most
parts of his
business
. In
short
, Cecilius was too much of a politi
cian to
suppose
that filial affection ought
to
stand
in the way of a man's
interest
,
and in this he judged as
most
other men
would have done in the fame
circumstances
.

and delirium of Mr.
Bull

s
mother
.Adventures
of
Peregrine

DEAR SIR,
About
the time in which
these
first
attempts were making, and the fame
of them had
raised
much
jealousy
among
some
, and much expectation among
others
,
there happened a
sad
quarrel in
John
Bull's
family. His mother,
[5]
[5]
The Church of England.
poor
woman
,
had been
seized
with
hysteric
sits
,
which
caused
her at times to be delirious
and full of all forts of whims. She had
taken it into her head that every one of
the family
must
hold knife and fork
and
spoon
exactly alike; that they
must
all
wash
their hands and face
precisely
in the
same
manner; that
they
must
sit
,
stand
, walk, kneel, bow,
spit
, blow their
noses
, and perform
every other animal function by the exact
rule of
uniformity
, which
she
had drawn
up with her own hand, and from which
they were not allowed to vary one hair's
breadth. If any one of the family
complained
of a lame ancle or
stiff
knee, or
had the crick in his neck, or happened to
cut his finger, or was any other way
so
disabled
as not to perform his duty to a
tittle,
she
was
so
far from making the
least
allowance, that
she
would frown and
scold
and rave like a bedlamite; and John was
such
an obedient
son
to his mother, that
he would lend her his hand to box their
B 2
ears, or his foot to kick their
backsides
,
for not complying with her humours.
This way of proceeding
raised
an uproar
in the family; for though
most
of them
complied, either through affection for the
old lady, or through fear, or
some
other
motive, yet others looked
sour
, and
grumbled
;
some
would openly find fault and
attempt to
remonstrate
, but they were
answered
with a kick or a thump, or a
cat-o'nine
tails, or
shut
up in a dark garret
'till they
promised
a compliance. Such
was the logic of the family in
those
days!
Among
the number of the
disaffected
,
was
Peregrine Pickle
,
[6]
[6]
The Plymouth Adventurers.
a pretty clever
sort
of
a fellow about his
business
, but a great
lover
of
sour
crout, and of an humour that
would not bear contradiction. However,
as he knew it would be
fruitless
to enter
into a downright quarrel, and yet
could not live there in peace; he had
so
much prudence as to quit the
house
,
which he did by getting out of the
window
in the night. Not liking to be out
of employ, he went to the
house
of
Nic
Frog
,
[7]
[7]
The States of Holland.
his
master
's old friend and rival,
told him the
story
of his
sufferings
, and
got leave to employ
himself
in one of his
workshops
till the
storm
should
be over.
After he had been here a while, he
thought Nick's family were as much too
loose
in their manners as Bull's were too
strict
; and having heard a rumour of the
Forest
, to which Nick had
some
kind of
claim, he packed up his little all, and
hired one of Nick's
servants
who had
been there a hunting, to pilot him to that
part of the
Forest
to which Nick laid
claim. But Frog had laid an anchor to
windward of him; for as Pickle had
said
nothing to him about a
lease
, he
supposed
that when Peregrine had got into the
Forest
he would take a
lease
of his old
master
,
Bull, which would
strengthen
his title,
and weaken his own; he therefore bribed
the pilot to
shew
Peregrine to a barren
part of the
Forest
instead
of that fertile
place
[8]
[8]
Hudson
's River.
to which he had already
sent
his
surveyors
, and of which he was contriving
to get
possession
. Accordingly the pilot
having conducted Pickle to a
sandy
point
which runs into the lake,
Cape Cod.
it being the
dusk
of the evening,
[9]
[9]
The month of December.
bade him good
night, and walked off. Peregrine, who
was fatigued with his march, laid down
and went to
sleep
, but waking in the
morning,
saw
himself
alone in a very
dreary
situation
, where he could get nothing
to live upon but clams, and a few acorns
which the
squirrels
had left. In this
piteous
plight the poor fellow folded his
arms, and walking along the
sandy
beach,
fell into
such
a
soliloquy
as this. So
much for travelling!
Abused
by Bull,
cheated by Frog, what am I at
last
come
to? Here I am alone, no creatures but
bears, and wolves, and
such
vermin around
me! Nothing in the
shape
of an human
being that I know of, nearer than
Pipeweed's
plantation, and with him I cannot
agree; he is
so
devoted to old Dame Bull
that he and I cannot live together any
more than I could with the old woman.
But, why
should
I
despair
? That is
unmanly
;
there is at
least
a
possibility
of my
living here, and if I am
disappointed
in
my worldly
prospects
, it is but right, for I
professed
not to have any. My
wish
was
to have my own way without
disturbance
or contradiction, and
surely
I can here
enjoy my liberty. I have nobody here
to
curse
me, or kick me, or cheat me. If
I have only clams to eat, I can cook them
my own way, and
say
as long a grace over
them as I
please
. I can
sit
or
stand
, or kneel,
or
use
any other
posture
at my devotions,
without any
cross
old woman to growl at
me, or any hectoring bully to cuff me for
it. So that if I have
lost
in one way I
have gained in another. I had better
therefore reconcile
myself
to my
situation
and make the
best
of a bad market. But
company is good! Apropos! I will write
to
some
of my fellow-apprentices; I know
they were as
discontented
as
myself
in old
Bull's family, though they did not care
to
speak
their minds as plainly as I did.
I'll tell them how much
happiness
I
enjoy
here in my
solitude
. I'll point out
to them the charms of liberty, and coax
them to follow me into the
wilderness
;
and by and by, when we get all together,
we
shall
make a brave hand of it. Full
of this
resolution
, he
sat
down on a
wind-fallen
tree, and pulling out his inkhorn
and paper, wrote a letter to
John Codline,
Humphry
Ploughshare
, and
Roger Carrier
,
three of his fellow-apprentices, informing
them of the extreme
happiness
he
enjoyed
in having liberty to eat his
scanty
meals in his own way, and to lay his
swelled
ancles and
stiff
knee in whatever
posture
was
most
easy
to him, conjuring
them by their former
friendship
, to come
to join them in carrying on the good work
so
happily begun, &c. &c. As
soon
as he
had
finished
the letter, (which had
deeply
engaged his attention) a
huntsman
happened to come along in
quest
of game.
This was a lucky
circumstance
indeed, for
Peregrine had not once thought of a
conveyance
for his letter; it proved
also
favourable
to him in another view, for the
huntsman
taking pity on his forlorn
situation
,
spared
him
some
powder and
shot
and a few
biscuit
which he happened to
have in his pocket;
so
taking charge of
the letter, he delivered it as it was
directed
.
This
letter arrived in good
season
, for
old Madam had grown much
worse
since
Pickle had left the family: her vapours
had
increased
, and her longings and
aversions
were much
stronger
. She had a
strange
lurch for embroidered petticoats
and high waving plumes; her
Christmas
pies
must
have double the quantity of
spice
that was
usual
; the
servants
must
make three bows where they formerly
made but one, and they
must
never come
into her
presence
without having curled
and powdered their hair in the pink of the
mode, for
she
had an
aversion
to every
thing plain, and an high
relish
for every
thing gaudy.
Besides
,
she
had an high
mettled chaplain
[10]
[10]
Archbishop
Laud.
who was
constantly
at
her elbow, and
said
prayers night and
morning in a brocaded
vest
with a gilded
mitre on his head; and he exacted
so
many
bows and
scrapes
of every one in the
family, that it would have puzzled a French
dancing
master
to have kept pace with
him. Nor would he perform the
service
at all
unless
a verger
stood
by him all the
while with a yard-wand in his hand; and
if any
servant
or apprentice
missed
one
bow or
scrape
, or made it at the wrong
time, or dared to look off his book, or
said
Amen in the wrong place, rap went
the
stick
over his head and ears or
knuckles
.
It was in vain to appeal from the
chaplain or the old Dame to their
master
,
for he was
so
obedient a
son
that he
suffered
them to govern him as they
pleased
;
nay, though broad hints were given
that the chaplain was an
emissary
of lord
Peter, and was taking advantage of the
old lady's
hysterics
to bring the whole
family into his
interest
, John gave no
heed to any of
these
insinuations
.
As
soon
as the letter of Peregrine
Pickle
arrived, the apprentices, to whom it
was directed, held a
consultation
what
they
should
do. They were heartily
tired
of the conduct of the chaplain; they
lamented the old lady's ill health, and
wished
for a cure; but there was at
present
no hope of it, and they concluded
that it was
best
to follow Pickle's advice,
and retire with him into the
Forest
.
Though they were infected with the
spirit
of adventure, yet they were a
set
of wary
fellows, and knew they could not with
safety
venture thither
unless
they had a
C
lease
of the land. Happily, however, for
them, Bull had a little while before that
put the affairs of the
Forest
into the
hands of a gentleman of the law,
[11]
[11]
The Council of Plymouth.
with
orders to
see
that the matter was properly
managed,
so
as to yield him
some
certain
profit. To this
sage
they applied, and
for the proper fees, which they clubbed
for between them, they obtained a
lease
,
under hand and
seal
; wherein, for
sundry
causes
him thereunto moving, the
said
Bull did grant and convey unto John
Codline and his
associates
,
so
many acres
of his
Forest
, bounded
so
and
so
, and
which they were to have, hold, and enjoy
for ever and ever, yielding and paying
so
and
so
, and
so
forth. When this grand
point was gained by the
assistance
of the
lawyer and
his clerks
, who knew how to
manage
business
, the adventurers
sold
all
their
superfluities
to the pawn brokers,
and got together what things they
supposed
they
should
want, and leaving be
hind them a note on the compter,
[12]
[12]
Letter written on board the Arabella, after the
embarkation of the
Massachusetts
settlers
.
to tell
their
master
where they were bound, and
what were their
designs
: they
set
off all
together and got
safe
into a part of the
Forest
adjoining to Pickle, who hearing
of their arrival, took his oaken
staff
in his
hand and hobbled along as
fast
as his lame
legs could carry him to
see
them, and a
joyful meeting indeed they had.
Having
laid their heads together, it was
agreed
that Codline
should
send
for a girl
whom he had courted,
The
Massachusetts
charter.
and marry her,
and that he
should
be
considered
as the
lord of the manor, that Pickle
should
have
a
lease
of that part which he had pitched
upon, and that
Ploughshare
and Carrier
should
for the
present
be
considered
as
members of Codline's family. John had
taken a great fancy to
fishing
, and thought
he could wholly or chiefly
subsist
by it;
but Humphry had a mind for a farm;
so
after a while they parted in
friendship
.
Humphry, with a pack on his back and a
spade
in his hand, travelled
across
the
Forest
till he found a wide meadow with a

running through it, which he
supposed
to be within John's grant, and
intended
still
to
consider
himself
as a
distant
member of the family. But as it fell
out
otherwise
, he was obliged to get a
new
lease

some
objections, but they were over ruled;
and

after another old fellow
servant

,
Colony of New-Haven.
came and
sat
down by him. They being
so
much
alike
in their views and
dispositions
, agreed
to live together as intimates, though in
two families, which they did till
Wheatear's
death, when
Ploughshare
became his
sole
heir, and the
estate
has ever
since
been
his. This Humphry was always a very
industrious
, frugal,
saving
husband
; and
his wife, though a formal
strait
laced
sort
of a body, yet always minded her
spinning
and knitting, and took excellent care of
her dairy. She always clothed her
children
in
homespun
garments, and
scarcely
ever
spent
a farthing for
outlandish
trinkets
.
The family and all its concerns were
under very exact regulations: not one of
them was
suffered
to peep out of doors
after
the
sun
was
set
. It was never
allowed
to brew on Saturday, left the beer
should
break the Fourth Commandment
by working on Sunday: and once it is
said
the
stallion
was impounded a whole
week for having held
crim. con
. with the
mare while the Old Gentleman was at his
devotions. Bating
these
peculiarities,
(and every body has
some
) Humphry was
a very good
sort
of man, a kind neighbor,
very thriving, and made a
respectable
figure, though he lived a retired life, and
did not much follow the
fashions
, yet he
raised
a good
estate
, and brought up a
large family, who knew how to get their
living wherever they could find land.

DEAR SIR,
After
Ploughshare
's
departure
,
John Codline with his family kept
on their
fishing
and planting, and
sometimes
went a hunting,
so
that they made
out to get a tolerable
subsistence
. John's
family grew, and he
settled
his
sons
as
fast
as they became of age, to live by
themselves
;
and when any of his old
acquaintance
came to
see
him, he bade them
welcome, and was their very good friend,
as long as they continued to be of his mind
,
and no longer; for he was a very
pragmatical
fort of a fellow, and loved to have
his own way in every thing. This was the
cause
of a quarrel between him and
Roger
Carrier
, for it happened that Roger had
taken a fancy to dip his head into water,
[14]
[14]
Anabaptists
.
as the
most
effectual way of
washing
his
face, and thought it could not be made
so
clean in any other way. John, who
used
the common way of taking water in
his hand, to
wash
his face, was
displeased
with Roger's innovation, and
remonstrated
against
it. The
remonstrance
had no
other effect, than to fix Roger's opinion
more firmly, and as a farther
improvement
on his new plan, he pretended that
no
person
ought to have his face
washed
till he was capable of doing it
himself
,
without any
assistance
from his parents.
John was out of patience with this
addition
,
and plumply told him, that if he did
not reform his principles and practice, he
would fine him, or flog him, or kick him
out of doors.
These
threats put Roger
on inventing other odd and
whimsical
opinions
.
He took offence at the letter X,
and would have had it expunged from the
alphabet.
[15]
[15]
Roger Williams's zeal
against
the
sign
of the
cross
.
He would not do his duty at
a military
muster
,
because
there was an
X in the colours. After a while he
began
to
scruple
the
lawfulness
of bearing
arms, and killing wild
beasts
. But, poor
fellow! the
worst
of all was, that being
seized
with a
shaking
palsy
,
Quakers.
which
affected
every limb and joint of him, his
speech
was
so
altered that he was unable to
pronounce certain letters and
syllables
as
he had been
used
to do.
These
oddities
and defects rendered him more and more
disagreeable
to his old friend, who,
however
,
kept his temper as well as he could,
till one day, as John was
saying
a long
grace over his meat, Roger kept his hat
on the whole time. As
soon
as the
ceremony
was over, John took up a
case
knife
from the table, and gave Roger a blow on
the ear with the broad
side
of it, then
with a
rising
stroke
turned off his hat.
Roger
said
nothing, but taking up his hat
put it on again; at which John broke
out into
such
a
passionate
speech
as this
You impudent
scoundrel
! is it come to
this! Have I not borne with your whims
and fidgets
these
many years, and yet
they grow upon you? Have I not talked
with you time after time, and proved to
you as plain as the
nose
in your face that
your notions are wrong? Have I not
ordered
you to leave them off, and warned
you of the
consequence
, and yet you have
gone on from bad to
worse
? You began
with dipping your head into water, and
would have all the family do the
same
,
pretending there was no other way of
washing
the face. You would have had
the children go dirty all their days, under
pretence that they were not able to
wash
their own faces, and
so
they
must
have
looked like the pigs till they were grown
up. Then you would talk your own
balderdash
linguo,
thee and thou, and nan
forfooth
and now you
must
keep your
hat on when I am at my devotions, and I
suppose
would be glad to have the whole
family do the
same
! There is no bearing
with you any longer
so
nowhear me,
I give you fair warning, if you don't mend
your manners, and retract your errors,
and
promise
reformation, I'll kick you
out of the
house
. I'll have no
such
refractory
fellows here: I came into this
forest
for
reformation
, and reformation I
will
have.
Friend
John (
said
Roger)
dost
not
thou remember when thou and I lived
together
in friend Bull's family, how hard
thou
didst
think it to be compelled to look
on thy book all the time that the hooded
chaplain was reading the prayers, and how
many knocks and thumps thou and I had
for offering to
use
our liberty, which we
thought we had a right to?
Didst
thou
not come hitherunto for the
sake
of
enjoying
thy liberty, and did not I come to
enjoy mine? Wherefore then
dost
thou
assume
to deprive me of the right which
thou
claimest
for
thyself
?
Don't
tell me (
answered
John) of
right and of libertyyou have as much
liberty as any man ought to have. You
have liberty to do right, and no man ought
to have liberty to do wrong.
Who
is to be judge (replied Roger)
what is right or what is wrong? Ought not
I to judge for
myself
? or,
Thinkest
thou
it is thy place to judge for me?
Who
is to be judge (
said
John) why
the book
is to be judgeand I have
proved
by the book over and over again that
you are wrong, and therefore you are
wrong, and you have no liberty to do any
thing but what is right.
But
friend John (
said
Roger) who
is to judge whether thou
hast
proved my
opinions or conduct to be wrongthou
or I?
Come
, come, (
said
John) not
so
close
neithernone of your idle
distinctions
: I
say
you are in the wrong, I have
proved
it, and
you know
it; you have
sinned
against
your own
conscience
, and therefore you
deserve
to be cut off as an incorrigible
heretic.
How
dost
thou know (
said
Roger)
that I have
sinned
against
my own
conscience
?
Canst
thou
search
the heart?
At
this John was
so
enraged that he
gave him a
smart
kick on the
posteriors
,
and bade him be gone out of his
house
,
and off his lands, and called after him to
tell him, that if ever he
should
catch him
there again he would knock his brains
out. Roger, having experienced the logic
of the foot, applied to the feat of honor,
walked off, with as much
meekness
as
human
nature is capable of, on
such
occasions
;
and having travelled as far as he
supposed
to be out of the limits of John's
lease
, laid
himself
down by the
side
of a
clear rivulet, which flowed down a hill;
here he
composed
himself
to
sleep
, and
on his awaking found
several
bears about
him, but none offered him any
insult
.
Upon which he
said
, and minuted it down
in his pocket book, Surely the
beasts
of
the
wilderness
are in
friendship
with me,
and this is
designed
by
Providence
[16]
[16]
The town of Providence was built by emigrants
from
Massachusetts
, of whom Roger Williams was
head.
as my
resting
place; here, therefore, will I pitch
my tabernacle, and here
shall
I dwell
more in peace, though
surrounded
by
bears and wolves, than when in the
midst
of
those
whom I counted my brethren.
On
this
spot
he built an hut, and
having
taken
possession
, made a
visit
to his old
master
Bull, who gave him a
lease
of the
D
place, with an
island
or two in an
adjoining
cove of the great lake, and
recommended
to him a wife, by whom he had a
few children; but his plantation was
chiefly
increased
by the flocking of
strangers
to him; for he was a very
hospitable
man, and made it a rule in his family not
to
refuse
any who
should
come, whether
lame or blind,
short
or tall, whether they
had two eyes or one, whether they
squinted
or
stammered
, or limped, or had any
other natural defect or impediment; it
was another rule that every one
should
bear with the infirmities of his
neighbours
,
and help one another as they were
able. Once as I was
passing
through
Roger's plantation I
saw
one man
carrying
another on his
shoulders
, which, at
first
, I thought a very odd fight; upon
coming up to them, I perceived that the
lower one was blind, and the upper one
was lame,
so
as they had but one pair of
eyes, and one pair of legs between them,
the lame man availed
himself
of the blind
man's legs, and he of the other's eyes, and
both went along very well together. I
remember
also
, that as I
passed
along, the
fences were in
some
places made of very
crooked, knotty rails; but the crooks and
knots were made to fay into each other
so
cleverly, that the fences were as tight as if
they had been made of
stuff
sawed
ever
so
even; a
circumstance
which convinced
me that very crooked things might be put
together, to advantage, if proper pains
were taken.
When
John Codline had
settled
the
controversy
with Roger, by kicking him
out of doors, he began to look about him
to
see
what his neighbours were doing.
Having found a young fellow on his north
eastern
limits, who had come thither
without
his knowledge or
permission
, he took
it into his head to
survey
the extent of
his grounds. The words of his
lease
were
rather ambiguous, and by virtue thereof
he thought it convenient to extend his
claims over the lands on which
Robert
Lumber
(for that was the name of the
young fellow) had
settled
.
[17]
[17]
New
Hampshire
was granted to John
Mason
, and
the claim
descended
to Robert
Mason
.
It
seems
that
Bob had been
sent
by
some
of John Bull's
family to erect a
fishing
stage
on the
borders
of the lake, and the lawyer who had
the care of the
forest
not being acquainted
so
much as he ought to have been with
the
situation
of the lands, or having no
knowledge of the art of
surveying
, had
made out a
lease
which lapped over
Codline's
;
so
that each of them had a claim
upon the
same
land. In
some
circumstances
this might have been deemed
unfortunate
,
but as it happened it proved
lucky for poor Bobhis employers had
left him in the lurch, and he would have
starved
to death if John had not taken
him under his wing and
sent
him
provisions
to keep him alive. He
also
lent him
a hand to clear up the
bushes
, and
furnished
him with materials to build a
saw
mill. This
set
Bob on his own legs, and
he proved a
sturdy
faithful fellow. He
was of great
service
to John in killing
bears and wolves that
infested
his
plantation
;
and when he
himself
was in
danger
,
John lent him powder,
shot
, and
flints, and
sent
hands to help him, and in
so
doing he
served
himself
as well as his
neighbour, which was no breach of
morality
.
Thus they lived pretty peaceably
together, till after a while Bob's old
owners
found the land was grown good for
something
, and then (without paying
John for his
assistance
in making it
so
)
appealed to Mr. Bull,
and got it away
,
and took a large
slice
of John's land into
the bargain.
[18]
[18]
The
settling
the line between
Massachusetts
and
New
Hampshire
.
This was a matter which
stuck
in John's throat a great while, and
if I am rightly informed he has hardly
swallowed
it yet. He did not think
himself
fairly dealt by, though he had all
Peregrine
Pickle's land put into a new
lease
D 2
which Bull gave him. To be
short
, John
Codline and John Bull never heartily
loved one another; they were in their
temper and
disposition
too much alike;
each was eternally jealous of the other:
and this
jealousy
was kept alive by a
variety
of incidents which it would be too
tedious to enumerate. One of them,
however, was of
so
singular
a nature that
I think it
deserves
to be remembered. It
was this. Old Lewis had erected a
fishing
stage
and ware
house
[19]
[19]
Louisburg
.
on the north
east
, which interfered with Codline's
favorite
employment. Without
consulting
his old
Master
Bull, or waiting for his
advice or orders, Jack
sent
a bailiff with
a writ of
intrusion
to the
fishermen
and
began a
suit
in law; Mr. Bull hearing of
it, was glad to take advantage of the
circumstance
and fee council in the
cause
,
which finally went in his favour. But
though the
issue
of the
cause
was of
so
much advantage to him; yet he ever
after
looked upon Codline as a forward,
saucy
fellow, for running on that errand
before he was
sent
; and there were not
wanting
persons
who were continually
buzzing in his ear, to keep a good look
out on that impudent jackanapes, or he
would
soon
begin to think
himself
as good
a man as his
master
.

DEAR SIR,
In
my
last
letter I had got a
little
too forward in my
story
, in point of
time; but as I write by piecemeal, and
often in a hurry, you
must
excuse
chronological
inaccuracy. I now go back to
tell you, that between the lands occupied
by Marygold, and
those
on which
Ploughshare
had made his
settlement
, was a large
tract of
waste
, where none of Mr. Bull's
family had ever been; but the report of
the plantations which one and another of
them had made, drew the attention of
Bull's neighbours. Among
these
,
Nicolas
Frog
[20]
[20]
The Dutch.
was not an idle
spectator
. He
was as
sly
a fellow as you will meet with
in a
summer
's day, always attentive to his
interest
, and never let
slip
an opportunity
to promote it.
Observing
that Mr. Bull
was rather
careless
of the
Forest
, and
trusted
his lawyers and
servants
with the
management of it, and knowing there
was a large
slice
of it unoccupied, he
clandestinely
sent
out
some
surveyors
in
the
disguise
of hunters, to make a
description
of the country, and report to him at
their return. Another good neighbour,
Gustavus
the ironmonger
The King of Sweden.
was gaping
after
it, and gave out word among his
journeymen
,
that if any of them would
adventure
thither and
set
up their trade, he
would uphold them in their
pretensions
,
and lend them any
assistance
in his power.
Accordingly one of them, by the name of
Casimir
, ventured to make a beginning on
the
shore
of a navigable creek;
[21]
[21]
The Delaware.
but did
not care to penetrate far into the country,
on account of the wolves and bears, which
were very numerous thereabouts. As
soon
as Frog heard of this, he picked a
quarrel with
Gustavus
, and
insisted
that
the land was his by
possession
,
because
he had already
sent
surveyors
thither.
It happened, however, that the place
which Frog's people had pitched upon
was at the mouth of another creek,
Hudson
's
River.
at a
considerable
distance
; where they had
built a hut, on a point of land, and
farther
up the creek had erected a kind of
lodge or hunting
house
,
[22]
[22]
Albany.
for the
convenience
of collecting game. On this
plantation
Frog had placed
Peter Stiver
, a
one-legged
fellow, as his
overseer
. As
soon
as Peter heard of the quarrel between his
master
and
Gustavus
, he thought the
quickest
way of ending it was the
best
;
and therefore, without waiting for orders
or ceremony, he went and commanded
Casimir
off the ground; and with one of
his crutches beat his
house
to pieces
about
his ears. The poor fellow
stared
at
this rough treatment; but was glad to
escape
with whole bones, and humbly
requested
leave to remain there with his
tools,
promising
to follow his
business
quietly, and become an obedient
servant
to Mr. Frog; upon
these
conditions he
was permitted to remain, and the whole
tract was reputed Frog's property.
While
these
things were doing, John
Bull was confined to his
house
with a
violent
fever and delirium,
[23]
[23]
The civil wars in England.
under which
he laboured for a long time, and his
imagination
was the
seat
of every wild freak
and
strange
vagary. One while he
fancied
himself
an
absolute
monarch; then, a
presbyterian
clergyman; then a general of
horse
; then a lord protector: His noddle
was filled with a jumble of polemic
divinity
,
political
disputes
, and military
arrangements
,
and it was not till after much
blood letting,
blistering
, vomiting and
purging, that he began to mend. Under
this
severe
, but
wholesome
regimen, he at
length grew cool and came to
himself
,
but found on his recovery that his affairs
had gone behind hand during his
sickness
.
Beside
the
loss
of
business
, he had
physicians
' and apothecaries' bills to pay,
and
those
who had attended upon him as
nurses
, watchers, porters, &c. all
expected
wages or douceurs, and were
continually
haunting him with, How does
your honour do? I am glad to
see
your
honour
so
well as to be abroad. Some
one or more were continually putting
themselves
in his way, and if they did not
directly
dun
him for payment, their looks
were
so
significant
that a man of
less
penetration
could
easily
have
guessed
what
was their meaning.
Bull
was
somewhat
perplexed how to
answer
all their demands and
expectations
.
He was too far behind hand to
be able to
satisfy
them, and withal too
generous to let them remain unpaid. At
length he hit on this expedient:
These
fellows,
said
he to
himself
, have
served
me
well, and may be of
use
to me again.
There is yet a
considerable
part of my
forest
unoccupied. I'll offer to
lease
them tracts of land which
cost
me nothing
,
and if they will accept them at a low rent,
they may prove
useful
servants
, and I
shall
be a gainer as well as they.
Having
come to this
resolution
, he began to
enquire into the affairs of his
forest
, and
found that his neighbours had intruded
upon
his claim. Lewis had taken
possession
at one end;
[24]
[24]
Canada
possessed
by the French.
Lord Strut at the other;
Florida
possessed
by the Spaniards.
and Nic Frog in the middle,
New
Amsterdam
and
the New Netherlands, by the Dutch.
and his own
tenants had been quarrelling with their
new neighbours, as well as among them
E
selves
. Hey day!
says
John, this will
never do; I
must
keep a good look out
upon
these
dogs, or they will get the
advantage
of me. Away he goes to Frog,
and begun to complain of the ill
treatment
which he had received. Frog, who
had no mind either to quarrel, or to cry
peccavi, like a fly,
evasive
whore
son
as
he was,
shrugged
up his
shoulders
,
disowned
what his
servants
had done, and
said
, he
supposed
they only meant to kill
game, and did not intend to hold
possession
.
Bull was not to be put off
so
; his
blood was up and he determined to treat
Frog's
servants
as they had treated
Casimir
.
So, calling a
trusty
old
stud
out of
his compting
house
, Here Bob,
[25]
[25]
Sir Robert Carr's expedition
against
Newamsterdam
,
now Newyork.
said
he,
take one of my
servants
with a couple of
blood hounds, and go to that part of the
forest
where Peter Stiver has encroached,
give him fair warning; tell him the land
is mine, and I will have it; if he gives up
at once, treat him well and tell him I'll
give him leave to remain there; but if he
offers to make any
resistance
, or
hesitates
about an
answer
,
set
your dogs at him and
drive him off; kill his cattle and
set
his
house
on fire; never fear, I'll bear you
out in it. Away goes Bob and
delivered
his
message
; Peter at
first
thought it a
matter of
amusement
, and began to divert
himself
with it; but as
soon
as the dogs
opened upon him he found his
mistake
,
and rather than run the
risk
of being
driven off, he quietly
submitted
to the
conditions
proposed
. Hang it,
said
he
to
himself
, what care I who is my
landlord
?
Gain is my object; I have already
been at great
expense
, and have a
prospect
of getting an
estate
. To remove
will ruin me; I'll therefore
stay
here, and
make money under Bull, or Frog, or any
other
master
that will let me
stay
.
In
a
subsequent
quarrel which
happened
between Bull and Frogthe latter
seized
upon this plantation again, and
Peter recognized his old
master
; but
upon
a
compromise
it was given up to Bull
in exchange for a tract of
swamp
[26]
[26]
Surrinam.
which
lay far to the
southward
. Peter
continued
on the ground through all
these
changes, and followed his
business
with
great diligence, collecting game and pelts,
and vending them
sometimes
to Mr.
Bull, and
sometimes
to Mr. Frog.
However
,
Bull thought it
best
, that in token of
subjection
, Stiver
should
change his name;
to which he
consented
, and partly to
please
his new
master
, and partly to
retain
the remembrance of his old one, he
assumed
the name of
Bullfrog
.
The
whole tract which was thus
gotten
from Frog, was thought too large for
one plantation, and therefore Mr. Bull,
in
pursuance
of the plan which he had
formed appropriated the rents of the
plantation, on which Bullfrog was
feated
,
to his brother, and the other was leaf
ed to two of his
servants
,
Cartrut
and
Bareclay
, and
sometime
after another
tract was
set
off to
William
Broadbrim
,
whose
father had been an
assiduous
ratcatcher in Mr. Bull's family; but
more of this hereafter.
Cartrut
and
Bareclay
agreed to
divide
their land into two farms, which they
called the
east
and
west
farms;
[27]
[27]
East
and
West
Jersey
.
but when
they came to run the
division
line, their
compasses
differed
so
much that they
could not fix the boundary. This was
one
cause
of
dissention
. Another was the
different humors and
dispositions
of their
families.
Those
on the
East
farm were
brought up under Mr. Bull's
sister
Peg
,
The church of Scotland.
and as it is well known that
she
and her
brother had long been at variance,
so
their
domestics
had got tinctured with the
notions
and prejudices of their
respective
families. The family on the
West
farm
was made up of
persons
who were
subject
E 2
to the epidemic ague or
shaking
palsy
;
[28]
[28]
The Quakers.
with
some
struggles
from Bullfrog's and
Casimir
's families. From this
diversity
of
constitutions
and humours
arose
bickerings
and quarrels, a
disinclination
to
work and
submit
to family government.
These
disorders
continued a long while,
and
business
went on very
slowly
, till at
length the heads of both families agreed
to give up their
separate
leases
, and take a
new one of the whole, and let Mr. Bull
appoint an
overseer
. By
these
means
peace was
restored
, and the new
overseer
,
who was
supposed
to be a
descendant
of
Julius Csar
, gave the name of his
ancestor
to the farm, which has ever
since
been called
Csarea
.
There
was another portion of the
forest
,
which lay
southward
of Walter
Pipeweed's
plantation, and which no
person
had yet taken up, though
some
had made
attempts and had been driven off by the
numberless
musquitoes
and
sand
flies,
which abounded in
those
places. Mr.
Bull was
still
desirous
to reward his
friends in the
cheapest
-manner
, and at the
same
time to keep his neighbors from
encroaching
upon him, and
secure
the
possession
of the
forest
to
himself
. In
pursuance
of his plan, and to make
short
work
of it at once, he
leased
the whole of this
southern
extremity to
Charles
Indigo
,
[29]
[29]
The Carolina company.
who was
expressly
ordered to take
under his care and into his family all
persons
who had attended Mr. Bull, in his
late
sickness
, in quality of
nurses
,
druggists
,
apothecaries,
laundresses
,
upholsters
,
porters, watchers, &c. &c. By this
order Charles found
himself
at once
surrounded
by a large body of retainers of
various ranks and qualities, and being a
speculator
himself
, he employed a
speculative
man, Mr.
Padlock
, who had
written
a large
treatise
upon
Ideas
, to draw
up fome rules, for the management of
such
a family, intending when he
should
build an
house
, to
paste
it up in the
parlour
,
as a directory to his wife.
Accordingly
Mr. Padlock went to work, and with
an
exquisite
mixture of political and
metaphysical
knowledge,
distinguished
between
the hall, the parlour, the
dressing
room, the gallery, the
music
room, the
bed chambers, the chapel, the kitchen, the
water
closet
, &c.
shewing
what was to be
done in each, and the proper
subordination
of one to the other, all which would
have been of excellent
service
in a palace,
and among people who had got to a high
degree of
resinement
, but was ill
suited
to
the
circumstances
of new adventurers in a
forest
. They rather needed to be
instructed
in the method of felling trees,
draining
swamps
, digging clams,
guarding
against
musquitoes
, killing wolves and
bears, and erecting huts to keep off the
weather. To
these
necessary
affairs they
were obliged to attend, and Mr. Padlock's
fine
spun
rules were laid by and little
thought of.
Charles
had pitched upon a
sandy
point, between two brooks, for his
mansion
house
, and had made a
small
beginning
,
when his
repose
was
disturbed
by
one
Augustine
,
[30]
[30]
St.
Augustine
in Florida.
a lubberly fellow, who
had taken a
lease
of Lord Strut, and
lived
farther
southward
. This Strut was
the
largest
landholder in the country, and
was never
satisfied
with adding field to
field. He had already got much more
than he could manage, and had greatly
impoverished
his
homestead
by attending
to his extra territories. His tenants were
infected with the
same
land fever, and
wished
to have no neighbors within fight
or call. From this envious
disposition
Augustine
collected a rabble of
lousy
fellows
,
and was coming to
dispossess
Charles,
thinking him too weak to make a defence;
but Charles was a lad of too much
spunk
to be brow beaten. He armed all his
people with
some
weapon or other, and
advanced till he came within fight of the
place where
Augustine
was, who on
seeing
him, took wit in his anger, and went
back, without attempting any
mischief
.
Another
difficulty which Charles
expected
to encounter was from the wild
beasts
; but luckily for him,
these
creatures
got into a quarrel among
themselves
,
and fought with each other till
they had thinned their numbers
considerbly
,
so
that Charles and his companions
could venture into the woods, where they
caught
some
few and tamed them, as was
the
usual
practice among all Mr. Bull's
tenants
at that day. Of this practice a more
particular account
shall
be given in my
next letter.

LETTER V.
Mr.
Bull
'
s project of taming wild
animals
.Its
execution by his tenants.
Their different notions and conduct in
this matter
.
DEAR SIR,
You
must
have remarked in your
acquaintance with the life and character
of Mr. John Bull, that he is very
whimsical
,
and as
positive
as
whimsical
. Among
other advantages which he expected from
the
settlement
of his
Forest
, one was, that
the wild animals whom nature had made
ferocious and untractable in the
highest
degree, would be rendered tame and
ferviceable
,
by receiving
instruction
and
education
from the nurturing hand of
humanity
.
He had conceived a notion that
every creature has certain latent
principles
and qualities which form a
foundation
for improvement; and he thought it
a great piece of
injustice
that
these
qualities
should
be
suffered
to remain
uncultivated
:
he had a mind that experiments
should
be attempted to
discover
how far
this kind of cultivation was practicable,
and what
use
could be made of the
animal
powers under the direction and
control
of rational government. Full of
this idea, he came to a
resolution
, that it
should
be the duty of every one of his
tenants to catch wild
beasts
of various
sorts
, and
discipline
them
so
as to find out
their
several
properties and capacities, and
use
them accordingly; and this kind of
service
was mentioned in their
respective
leases
as one condition of the grants.
Some
of the tenants, particularly
Peregrine
Pickle, John Codline, and
Humphry
Ploughshare
, entered
zealously
into
the
measure
from principle. They had,
during Mr. Bull's
sickness
and delirium,
before
spoken
of, formed an
association
for their mutual
safety
.
[31]
[31]
The united colonies of New England, 1643.
The object of
their union was two fold:
first
, to
endeavour
by all fair means to tame and
discipline
the wild
beasts
; and
secondly
, in
cafe of their proving refractory, to defend
themselves
against
their attacks. The
other tenants did
something
in the
same
way;
some
from one principle, and
some
from another. Peter Bullfrog, who was
as cunning as any of them, made
use
of
those
which he had tamed as his caterers,
to provide game for his table, of which
the feathers and furs
served
him as
articles
of traffic, and brought him in a
profitable
return.
The
principal
consideration
(
setting
aside
interest
) which induced the more
zealous of the
Foresters
to enter into this
business
, was an idea, that
these
animals
were a degenerated part of the human
species
, and might be
restored
to their
proper rank and order if due pains were
taken. The grounds of this opinion were
F
these
: Among the traditions of the ancient
Druids there was a
story
, that out of
twelve
families which inhabited a certain
district
by
themselves
,
ten
had been
lost
, and no
account could be given of them; and,
Where,
said
they, is it more likely to find
them than in this
forest
, in the
shape
of
some
other creatures?
especially
, if the
doctrine of TRANSMIGRATION, which
the Druids held be true. Another
tradition
was, that one of Mr. Bull's great
great uncles, by the name of
Madok
, had
many years ago
disappeared
, and the
last
accounts which had been received of him
was, that he had been
seen
going towards
this
forest
; hence it was concluded that
his
descendants
must
be found there. In
confirmation of this argument, it was
alleged
,
that the
sounds
which
some
of
these
creatures made in their howlings,
resembled
the language
spoken
in that
day: nay,
some
were
positive
that they
had heard them pronounce the word
Madokawando
;
[32]
[32]
The name of a Sachem at
Penobscot
.
and one hunter roundly
swore
that he had
seen
in the den of a
bear, an old
book
which he
supposed
to be
a
Bible
written in the Celtic language, and
this book they concluded
must
have been
left there by
Madok
, who could read and
speak
no other language. Another very
material
circumstance
was the
discovery
of a rock by the
side
of a brook,
[33]
[33]
The celebrated rock, at Dighton, in
Massachufetts
.
inscribed
with
some
characters which bore
no
resemblance
to any kind of writing,
ancient or modern; the
conclusion
from
hence was, that it
must
be of the
remotest
antiquity: this rock was deemed an
unaccountable
curiosity
, till a certan
virtuoso
took into his noddle,
first
to
imagine
,
and then to become extremely
positive
that the characters were
Punic
; and
finally this
inscription
was
translated
, and
affirmed to be nothing
less
than a treaty
of alliance and commerce between the
Phenicians
and the
first
inhabitants of
this
forest
. From all
these
premises
it was
inferred, with
some
plausibility
, and more
positiveness
, that one
species
at
least
of the
savage
animals was
descended
from
Madok
,
and that the others were the
posterity
of
the long
lost
ten
families, who were well
known to have had a commercial
connexion
with the
Phenicians
, and that
these
probably found out their haunt,
and followed them for the
sake
of their
former
friendship
. What happy light
do modern
discoveries
and conjectures
thrown on the dark pages of antiquity!
From
these
principles, as well as from
motives of humanity and of
interest
,
some
of the
Foresters
entered with zeal on the
consideration
and practice of the
best
methods to fulfil this condition of their
grants, the
disciplining
the
savage
animals
,
and they certainly
deserve
praise
for
their
honest
endeavours; but, others who
pretended to the
same
zeal, it is to be
lamented
,
made
use
of this pretence to
cover
their vanity or their avarice. Had
none but gentle means been
used
, it
is probable more good might, on the
whole, have been produced; but as it
often happens that many a good project
has been ruined for want of prudence in
the execution,
so
it fared with this; for
while the new comers were
busy
in
putting up their huts, and preparing the
land for cultivation, both which were
necessary
before they could attend to any
other
business
,
some
of the
savage
tribe
would be a little impertinent, either by
peeping into the huts, or breaking up
a
nest
where the poultry were hatching,
or carrying off a chick or a
gosling
.
These
impertinencies bred frequent quarrels,
and the poor creatures were
sometimes
driven off with bloody
noses
, or obliged
to hop on three legs, or even laid
sprawling
and
slyly
covered with earth, no
service
or ceremony being
said
over the
carcass
,
and no other epitaph than Poh,
they are nothing but brutes, and where's
F 2
the harm of killing them! or in rhyme
thus:
Tit for tat, tit for tat,
He
stole
my chick and I broke his back.
Whatever
plausible
excuses
might
have been made for
these
proceedings,
they
served
to render the creatures jealous
of their new neighbors; but
instead
of
abating
their appetite for
mischief
, it
sharpened
their invention to take more
sly
methods of
accomplishing
it. The more
wary of them kept aloof in the day timd,
and would not be enticed by the arts
which were
used
to draw them in;
however
,
they were
sometimes
pinched for
food, and the new inhabitants
used
to
throw
crusts
of bread, handfuls of corn,
and other eatables, in their way, which
allured them by degrees to familiarity.
After a while it was found that nothing
succeeded
so
well as
molaffes
. It was
therefore
thought a capital manuvre to drop
a train of it on the ground, which the
creatures would follow, licking it, till they
had
insensibly
got up to the doors of the
houses
, where, if any body held a bowl
or a plate
besmeared
with the liquor, they
would come and put their
noses
into it,
and then you might pat them on the back
and
sides
, or
stroke
them,
saying
, Poor
Bruin, poor I
sgrim
, poor Reynard, poor
Puss
, and the like, and they
should
suffer
themselves
to be handled and fondled
till they dropped
asleep
. When they
awaked
they would make a moan and wag
their tails as if they were
asking
for more,
and if it was denied them, they would
retire to the woods in
disgust
, till the
scent
of the molaffes operating on their
depraved
appetites, invited them to return where
it was to be had. This was upon
repeated
trial found to be the
most
effectual way
of taming them, as they might be taught
to imitate any kind of tricks and
gestures
if a
dish
of molaffes was held out as a
reward
.
The
Foresters
knew that they could
not ingratiate
themselves
better with their
old
master
Bull, than by humouring his
itch for projects. They therefore took
care to
raise
reports and write letters from
time to time concerning the wonderful
success
which they had met with in
civilizing
the
savage
animals. Bull was
greatly
pleased
with
these
reports, and made a
practice of
sending
presents
of trinkets to
be
distributed
among them;
such
as
collars
,
earrings, and
nosejewels
. Several
times
some
of the
most
stately
and
best
instructed
of them were carried to his
house
for a
show
, where he had them
dressed
up in
scarlet
and gold trappings,
and led through all his apartments for the
entertainment of his family, and
feasted
with every nicknack which his cook and
confectioner could procure. He was
so
fond of being thought their patron and
protector, that he
usually
spoke
of them
as his
red children
, from the colour of their
hides. It is not many years
since
one of
them, after being led through
several
families
and plantations of the tenants, was
carried home to Mr. Bull's own
house
,
dressed
in the habit of a
clergyman
,
having
been
previously
taught to lift his paw
and roll his eyes as if in the act of
devotion
.
This trick was
so
well carried on
that the managers of it picked up a large
pocket full of pence, by exhibiting him
for a raree
show
, and the money was
applied
toward building a
menagerie
, where
beasts
of all kinds might be brought and
tamed. This project, like many
such
whims, has made more
noise
than profit;
for
most
of
those
who were
supposed
to
be tamed and
domesticated
, after they had
been
sent
back to their native woods, with
a view to their being
instrumental
in
taming their fellow
savages
, have returned
to their former ferocious habits, and
some
of them have proved greater rogues than
ever, and have done more
mischief
than
they could
otherwise
have been capable
of.
Mr
. Bull
himself
was once
so
full of the
project, that he got his chaplain and
some
others to form
themselves
into a club; the
professed
object of which, was to
propagate
knowledge
among
these
savage
creatures
.
After
some
trials which did not
answer
expectation, old Madam Bull
conceived
that the money which was
collected
might as well be expended in teaching
Mr. Bull's own tenants
themselves
a
little
better manners; for
some
of them
were rather awkward and
slovenly
in their
deportment, while others were decent and
devout
in their own way
. Madam, as we
have before
observed
, was a great zealot
in the
cause
of
uniformity
, and had a
vast
influence over her
son
, by virtue of which
the attention of the club was principally
directed to the promoting this grand
object
.
Accordingly, every one of the
tenants
was
furnished
with a Bible and a
Prayer Book, a clean napkin,
bason
,
platter
,
and chalice, with a few devotional
tracts, and
some
young adventurers who
had been educated in the family, were
recommended as chaplains; who had
also
by orders to keep a look out toward the
savage
animals, when they
should
fall in
their way.
The
chaplains were tolerably well
received
in
most
of the families; but
some
,
particularly Codline and
Ploughshare
,
who gloried in being able to
say
their
prayers
without book
, always looked sour
upon them, and would frequently
say
to
them, Go, take care of the
savage
objects
of your
mission
, and don't come here
to teach us, till you have learned better
yourselves
. The chaplains in
disgust
,
and perhaps in revenge, for they were but
men of like
passions
, would pout and
swell
and call
fchifmatic
and other canonical nick
names, of which there is extant a large
vocabulary, and would frequently write
letters, much to the
disadvantage
of their
opponents. It is not many years
since
they, with the club which
sent
them, were
pretty
severely
handled by one of
Codline's
own chaplains, and it is
supposed
that they have ever
since
been more
modest
;
certain it is that they are now on
better terms with their neighbors than
formerly; this may, in part, be owing to
Mr. Bull's
deserting
them and
refusing
to
pay them for their
services
ever
since
the
time that he began to quarrel with his
tenants. On that
occasion
some
of them
removed their quarters; others kept their
old places and have got along as well as
they could without the help which they
formerly received.
LETTER VI.
Adventures of
Charles Indigo
and
Peter
Pitch
.
Character of
William
Broadbrim
.
His projects, principles,
and a
specimen
of his harrangues
.
DEAR SIR,
I HAVE
observed
, in a former
letter, that the
lease
which Mr. Bull gave
to Charles Indigo, obliged him to receive
into his family all
such
persons
as had
been attendants on Mr. Bull during his
sickness
, and for whom he had no other
means of providing. This general
indulgence
procured to Charles the reputation
of a very friendly,
hospitable
person
, and
induced great numbers of other people
of various characters, views, and
interests
,
to
seek
an
asylum
within his limits.
About
this time old Lewis had grown
sick
and
peevish
, and had
severely
cudgelled
some
G
of his apprentices,
because
they did not
make their P's and Q's exactly to his
mind.
[34]
[34]
Revocation of the edict of Nantz, by Lewis XIV.
1685.
The poor fellows, to prevent
worse
treatment, fled from his
house
, and
took refuge with Mr. Bull, who treated
them civilly, and recommended them to
the
Forest
, where they
dispersed
themselves
in the
several
families of his tenants,
and a large party of them took up their
abode with Charles, to whom they
proved
an
industrious
, profitable
acquisition
,
though
some
of the family looked a little
sourly
upon them.
This
facility of admitting
strangers
produced
an effect which had
almost
proved
fatal to the reputation of the family; for
a number of highwaymen
Pirates.
also
sought
shelter
there, and by means of their gold
and
silver
, which they had in plenty,
made friends in the
house
, and were
admitted
by night at a back door. After a
while they grew more bold, and came in
the day time, under the
disguise
of
pedlars
,
with packs on their
shoulders
. One
of them actually took his
stand
behind a
corner of one of the fences, from whence
he
sallied
out on travellers; this corner
obtained
,
from that
circumstance
, the name
of
Cape Fear;
and as the
first
names of
places are not
easily
got rid of, it retains
the name to this day, and perhaps will
ever
retain it. Here the
rascal
intended to
have built
himself
a lodge, and taken up
his quarters for life; but the matter was
now grown
so
public, that Charles, for the
honour of his family, ordered all
stragglers
to be
seized
, and this fellow in
particular
,
after a fevere
struggle
, was
apprehended
and brought to
justice
.
The
same
spot
was afterward taken
possession
of by
Peter Pitch
,
[35]
[35]
Northcarolina.
a poor
fellow who got his living as he did his
name, from collecting the
resinous
juice
of the numerous pines which grew
thereabouts
.
He had to work hard and fare
hard, and go a great way for his victuals
and clothes; but after he had lived alone
for
some
time, he picked up one or two
acquaintances of his own
stamp
, and they
formed a family, which was at
first
rather
disorderly
. Farther
discovery
of the
lands, and the advantage of the water
carriage
,
induced
some
other people to
sit
down by him, and in
process
of time he
became
so
respectable
as to be noticed by
Mr. Bull, who, though he never gave him
a
lease
in form, yet let him have cloth and
haberdashery
upon credit, and took his
pitch in payment as
fast
as he could
collect
it. This kept him in a dependent
state
,
and
subjected
him to
impositions
from
Bull's clerks and journeymen. About
twenty years ago, Bull
sent
him a taylor
to
try on
a new coat,
[36]
[36]
Insurrections
in Northcarolina, 1771.
which was
so
strait
that it
split
in
several
places, and never
could be altered
so
as to fit him; but he
was obliged to wear it rather than quarrel
with his patron. This
same
taylor was
remarkable for
cabbaging
, as Peter
Bullfrog
and Humphry
Ploughshare
have
since
had large experience.
To
finish
what relates to Charles
Indigo
,
I
shall
observe
, that the land on which
he began his plantation, was in general
so
wet and miry, that it was unfavourable to
the production of wheat, and it was for
some
time doubtful whether he would be
able to
raise
his own bread. Chance at
length effected what labour and
ingenuity
could not: a bird of
passage
having
dropped
some
kernels of rice in his dung,
it was found to thrive exceedingly well;
from whence the hint was taken, and rice
became the
standard
grain of the
plantation
.
By the cultivation of this, and of a
weed which, was ufeful to the dyers, he
grew rich, and made a fightly figure
among
his neighbours in point of
dress
and
equipage; though his countenance is
G 2
rather
sallow
, and he is
subject
to frequent
returns of the intermittent fever.
By
the
extensive
lease
given to Indigo
and his
associates
,
most
of Mr. Bull's
dependants
and attendants were provided for,
and their
services
recompensed
with a
shew
of
generosity
on his part, and of
satisfaction
on theirs. I have before
just
hinted at a grant made to
William
Broadbrim
,
[37]
[37]
Pennsylvania
.
of which I
shall
now give
a more particular account.
His
father had been an old
servant
of
Mr. Bull, and had been employed in the
very laborious and
necessary
business
of
catching and killing rats. In this
employment
he was
so
very dexterous and
successsul
,
that he recommended
himself
highly to his
master
, who not only
allowed
him large wages, but
promised
him
farther
recompense
. During Mr. Bull's
sickness
, the care and diligence of this
faithful
servant
had been unremitted, and
his merits were thereby
increased
,
so
that
Mr. Bull, on his recovery, found
himself
deeply indebted to him, and he
still
continued
his
services
; till worn out with age
and infirmity, he died and had an
honorable
funeral.
His
son
William then became his heir,
and
solicited
for payment of the
arrears
due to his father, which Mr. Bull,
according to the maxim he had laid down
for
himself
, and urged by the
necessity
of
the
occasion
,
proposed
to
discharge
by a
lease
of part of the
Forest
. This
happened
to fall in, exactly, with William's
views, which were of a
singular
nature.
About
this time a nervous
disorder
appeared in Bull's family, which went by
the name of the
shaking
palsy
.
[38]
[38]
Ouakerism
.
We
shall
not pretend to trace the
causes
of it, as the
origin of
such
things is often
obscure
and
impenetrable; but the effects were, a
trembling of the nerves, a
stissness
in the
neck and
shoulders
, and a
hesitancy
in the
speech
,
so
that it was
impossible
for the
patients to pronounce certain words and
syllables
,
such
as Sir, Madam, your
Honor
,
my Lord, &c. nor could one of them
raise
his hand to take off his hat, or hold
it on the book when an oath was to be
administered
.
Mr.
Bull's choleric temper
misinterpreted
this natural infirmity into a fullen
disrespect
. When he found a change in
the behaviour of
these
domestics
; that
instead
of bowing to him they
stood
upright
as a maypole, and
instead
of Sir, and
your Honor, they could utter nothing but
Friend
, he grew angry, and made a pretty
free
use
of his
fist
; and when he found
that they could not be cured by
such
means, he
thrust
some
of them into a dark
closet
, and
shut
them up till they
should
,
as he termed it, learn better manners;
and it is
supposed
he would have carried
his
resentment
much further, but for this
circumstance
; William Broadbrim, who
had
himself
strong
symptoms
of the
disorder
,
whispered
to Mr. Bull, that if he
would give him time to ripen a project,
which he had conceived, he would rid
him of all trouble with
these
people.
William had a plodding genius, and the
scheme
with which his head was pregnant
at this time, was nothing more or
less
than
to make a
settlement
in the
forest
, and
take all
these
people with him. Bull,
who was glad to get rid of them, and of
the debt which he owed to William,
readily
fell in with the project; and a grant
was made out under hand and
seal
,
wherein
William Broadbrim, and his heirs,
were
invested
with the right of
soil
, and
all other privileges of
proprietorship
, in a
certain part of the
forest
, between the
plantation of Marygold and that of
Cartrut
and Bareclay, being in the
neighborhood
of the
spot
where
Casimir
had
rebuilt
his hut, and lived in an ambiguous
situation
, not knowing who was his
landlord
.
With him William made a
peaceable
compromise
,
saying
, Friend, I will
do thee no violence, there is room enough
for us both.
Casimir
was glad of
so
good a neighbor, and he had
reason
to be,
for he throve more rapidly after this than
before.
William
pitched upon a level piece
of ground, where two large brooks met,
for the
situation
of his
mansion
house
,
and went to work to draw up rules for
the government of his family. One of
which was, that no
person
should
be
refused
admittance into it, or
disturbed
in
it, or
cast
out of it, on account of any
natural infirmity. Another was, that no
arms, nor ammunition,
should
ever be
made
use
of on any pretence whatever.
The
first
of
these
rules gained William
great reputation among all
sensible
men;
the latter was a notion which candor would
lead us to
suppose
proceeded from a love
of peace, and the
exercise
of good will
toward
his fellow creatures; though
some
were
so
illnatured as to imagine that it
was an effect of the
disorder
in his nerves.
When
any of William's neighbors,
who were of a different way of thinking,
spake
to him of the impolicy of this rule,
and
asked
him how he expected to defend
himself
and his family
against
the wild
beasts
, if they
should
attack him;
William
,
who was fond of harangue, would
answer
thusThere is in all
creatures
a certain
instinct
, which
disposeth
them to peace. This
instinct
is
so
strong
and fixed, that upon it, as upon a
foundation
,
may be erected a complete
system
of love and concord, which all the powers
of anarchy
shall
not be able to overthrow.
To cultivate and improve this
instinct
is
the
business
of every
wise
man, and he
may
reasonably
expect that an example
of this kind, if
steadily
and regularly
adhered
to, will have a very
extensive
and
beneficial influence, on all
sorts
of
creatures
;
even the wild
beasts
of the
forest
will become tame as the lambs, and birds
of prey as
harmless
as doves.
Dost
thou
not
see
, friend, what influence my
example
has already had on
those
creatures
which are deemed
savage
? I go into their
dens with
sasety
, and they enter my
habitation
without fear. When they are
hungry I feed them, when they are
thirsty
I give them drink, and they in return
bear my burdens, and do
such
other kind
offices as they are capable of, and I require
of them. I have even tamed
some
of
them
so
far, that they have
sold
me the
land on which they live, and have
acknowledged
the bargain by a mark made
with their toe nails on parchment. They
are certainly
some
of the
best
natured
creatures
in the world; their native
instinct
leads them to love and peace, and
sociability
,
and as long as I
set
them a good
example I have no doubt they will follow
it. When
such
is my opinion and
expectation
,
why
should
I be anxious about
what may, and I
trust
never will happen?
Why
should
I put
myself
in a
posture
of
defence
against
those
who may never
attack
me? or, why
should
I, by the
appearance
of
jealousy
and
distrust
on my
part, offend
those
who now put
confidence
in me? No, no, I will not
suppose
that they will ever hurt me. I will not
suffer
the
carnal weapon
to be
seen
in my
house
, nor
shall
one of my family ever
learn the
detestable
practice of pulling the
trigger. I leave the
instruments
of
destruction
to the offspring of Cain and the
seed
of the
serpent
; while I meekly
imitate
the
gentleness
of the lamb, and the
innocence of the dove.
With
such
harrangues William would
frequently entertain
himself
and his
friends, and he was
so
sanguine
in his
benevolent
project, that
instead
of having
his own name, as was
usual
, written over
his door, he had the words BROTHERLY
LOVE,
translated
into the Greek language,
H
and
inscribed
in golden characters, as a
standing
invitation to
persons
of all
nations
and characters to come and take
shelter
under his roof.

sickness
, and
second
marriage.His project of making a new

Scotus
.
DEAR SIR,
The
general invitation which
William Broadbrim had given to all
persons
who were
destitute
of a home, to come
and take
shelter
under his roof, and the
gentle humane treatment which
those
who accepted the invitation met with,
spread
his fame abroad, and brought him
much company. His family was
sometimes
compared to the Ark of Noah,
because
there was
scarcely
any kind of
being
,
of whatever
shape
,
size
, complexion,
disposition
, or language, but what might
be found there. He had
also
the art to
keep them pretty well employed.
Industry
,
frugality, and temperance, were
the leading principles of his family; and
their thriving was in a ratio compounded
of
these
three forces. Nothing was
wanting
to make them as happy a family as any
in the world, but a
disposition
among
themselves
, to live in peace. Unluckily,
however, this
desirable
blessing
, on
account
of the variety of their humours and
interests
, was
seldom
found among them.
Ambition,
jealousy
, avarice, and party
spirit
, had frequent out breakings, and
were with difficulty quelled. It is
needless
to enter into a very particular
discussion
of the grounds or effects of
these
dissentions
:
family quarrels are not very
entertaining either at home or abroad,
unless
to
such
as delight in
scandal
. But
there was one
cause
of
dissention
which it
would be improper not to notice,
because
I have already hinted at the principle
from which it proceeded. William's
aversion
to fire arms was
so
strong
, that
he would not
suffer
any of his family to
molest
the wild inhabitants of the
forest
,
though they were ever
so
mischievous
.
While the family was
small
, the
savage
animals who lived in the neighborhood
being well fed, were tolerably tame and
civil, but when the
increased
number of
the family had penetrated farther into the
forest
, the haunts of the natives were
dissturbed
,
and the
straggling
labourers were
sometimes
surprised
, and having nothing
to defend
themselves
with, fell a
sacrifice
to
savage
resentment
.
Remonstrances
were
presented
to Mr. Broadbrim one
after another, but he always
insisted
on
it that the
sufferer
must
have been the
aggressor
, and that they who take the
sword
must
expect to
perish
by the
sword
.
At length the dead
corpse
of one of the
labourers, mangled and torn in a
dreadful
manner, was brought and laid at the
H 2
door of William's parlour
[39]
[39]
State
house
, 1755.
with a label
affixed to the
breast
, on which were
written
these
words, Thou
thyself
must
be
accounted my murderer,
because
thou
didst
deny me the means of defence. At
sight
of this horrid
spectacle
, Broadbrim
turned pale! the eye of his mind looked
inward! Nature began to plead her own
cause
within him! he gave way in
some
degree to her operations, though contrary
to his preconceived opinion, and with a
trembling hand
signed
a
permission
for
those
to
use
the
carnal weapon
,
Militia act.
who could
do it without
scruple
; and when they
asked
him for money to buy guns,
powder
and ball, he gave them a certain
sum
to provide
the
necessaries
of life
, leaving
them to put their own
construction
on the
words. By degrees his
squeamishness
decreased
,
and though it is imagined he has
still
some
remainder of it, yet
necessity
has
so
often overcome it, that there is not
much
said
on the
subject
,
unless
it be very
privately and among
friends
.
During
the time of which we have
been
speaking
, Mr. John Bull had
undergone
another
sickness
,
[40]
[40]
The Revolution, 1688.
not
so
long nor
so
violent as the former, but much more
beneficial in its effects. His new
physicians
had
administered
medicines which
composed
his nerves; he eat, drank, and
slept
more regularly; and he was
advised
to marry again, for his former wife had
died of a
consumption
a little before this
sickness
came on. By
these
means his
vigour was renewed, but
still
his
whimsical
disposition
remained, and broke out
on
several
occasions
. When he viewed
his
extensive
forest
, now planted and
thriving, under the
honest
hand of
industry
,
he thought within
himself
that
still
greater advantages might be derived from
that territory. There was yet a part of it
unsettled
between the plantation of Charles
Indigo, and the dominions of Lord Strut;
and Bull thought it a pity to let
so
much
remain a
wilderness
. The other
plantations
had been made by
discontented
servants
and needy adventurers, who,
struggling
with
hardships
, a
steady
perseverance
had
surmounted
many
difficulties
,
and obtained a comfortable living.
Now,
said
Bull, if
these
fellows have
done
so
well, and got
so
far aforehand,
without having any capital of their own
to begin with, what cannot be done by the
force of my great capital? If they have
performed
such
wonders, what greater
wonders may be brought into view by my
own exertions, with all the advantages
which it is in my power to command?
To it, boys, I vow I'll have a farm of my
own that
shall
beat you all!Having
hit upon this project, his brains
immediately
became pregnant with ideas; but
according to the rule which he had lately
prescribed
to
himself
, he communicated
the matter to his wife. This good lady
was not free from an ambitious turn of
mind. She was extremely fond of
having
it thought that
she
had great influence
over her
husband
, and would
sometimes
gratify his humour at the
expense
of her
own judgment, rather than not keep up
this idea. His expectations from his new
project were very
sanguine
. The land
on which he had
cast
his eye was enough
for a large farm; it had a
southern
exposure
,
it was warm, rich and fertile in
some
parts, and in others boggy or
sandy
.
He had
conversed
with
some
foreigners,
who told him that it was proper for the
cultivation of wine and
silk
, and he
imagined
that if he could but add
these
articles
to the
list
of his own productions,
there would be a great
saving
in the
family
.
Mrs. Bull too was
pleased
with the
idea of having her
silk
gowns and ribbands
of her own growth, and with the
expectation
of having the vaults filled with wine,
made on her own plantation; for
these
and
other good
reasons
, her thereunto
moving
,
madam gave her
consent
to the proj
ect. The
person
appointed to carry it
into execution was
George
Trusty
,
[41]
[41]
The
trustees
of Georgia, 1732.
a
sensible
well bred merchant, but one who had
only
speculated
in the
science
of
agriculture
,
and knew nothing of it by
experience
.
Having collected a number of poor
people who were out of employment, he
sent
them to the
spot
, with
strict
orders to
work fix days in
seven
, to keep their tools
free from
rust
, and their fire arms in
readiness
for their defence. Whatever they
should
earn was to be
their own
as long as
they lived, and after their death their
possessions
were to
descend
to their
sons
, and
in default of male
issue
to revert to the
orriginal
grantor. They were not allowed
to
use
black cattle in the labour of the
field; and were
expressly
forbidden to
drink grog. Their
business
was to
cultivate
vines and mulberry trees, and to
manufacture wine and
silk
. Upon this
project another was grafted by the very
sagacious
Doctor Squintum
, who
chose
this
new plantation as the
most
convenient
spot
in the world for a charity
school
,
where
Orphans
might receive the
best
education
and be fitted to be the pillars of
church and
state
.
But
notwithstanding
the
sums
which
Bull
so
freely
lavished
out of his bags for
the
support
of the vine and mulberry
plantations; and
notwithstanding
the
collections
which Squintum made among
his numerous devotees,
these
projects
were either
so
impracticable in
themselves
,
or
so
ill conducted in the execution, that
neither of them
answered
the expectations
of the projectors. For want of black
cattle
,
the
soil
could not be properly tilled;
and for want of grog, the labourers
fainted
at their work; the right of inheritance
being limited to the male line, women
and girls were not fond of living there,
and the men could not well live without
them; land, cattle, women and grog,
were to be had
elsewhere
, and who would
be confined to
such
a place? The land,
too, was claimed by Lord Strut, who
sent
them writs of ejectment. As to the
Charity
school
, it was, on trial, found
that the
cost
was more than the profit,
and the building which had
swallowed
up
thousands
of charity money, was finally
consumed
by fire. Poor George
Trusty
was
discouraged
, and begged Mr. Bull
to take the plantation into his own hands;
however, Bull continued to
supply
him
with
cash
, and he kept making attempts.
Alterations were made in the terms of
settlement
,
the
restrictions
were removed,
cattle and grog were allowed, Lord Strut
was
ousted
, and
possession
held; the
swamps
were drained; rice and indigo
were cultivated
instead
of
silk
and wine;
and upon the whole,
considerable
improvements
were made, though at
such
a
vast
expense
, that Mr. Bull never
saw
any
adequate returns.
The
ill
success
of this adventure did
not deter him from another project. He
was extremely fond of
Trout,
[42]
[42]
Cod
fishery
.
and thought
if he could have them regularly catched
and brought to his table, he
should
exceed
all his neighbours in delicate living;
and now and then be able to
send
a
mess
to his particular friends. Lord Peter's
family too, he thought, would be glad to
buy them, as they were very
useful
in the
long lents, and frequent meagre days
observed
by them. There was a part of the
forest
on the north-
east
quarter, which
was very conveniently
situated
for this
employment.
Nova Scotia.
It had been occupied by
Alexander Scotus
, a purblind
fellow
,
who had
straggled
thither no one
could tell how; and it was matter of
doubt whether he derived his right from
Bull, or Lewis; for both of them laid
claim to the land, and their claims had
not been fairly decided in law. To make
sure
of the matter, Mr. Bull, by advice of
his wife,
sent
a waggon to bring off the
family of Scotus, whom he
distributed
a
I
mong the other families of his tenants;
and in their room
sent
thither
[43]
[43]
1749.
a parcel
of naked, half
starved
people, who could
live no where
else
, and
supported
them
for
several
years with
provisions
,
furnished
them with
skiffs
, lines, hooks and
other
implements to carry on the
fishery
;
but every trout which they catched,
cost
him ten times as much as if he had bought
it in the common market; nor could
he, after all, get half what he wanted for
his own
consumption
. His trout
fishery
,
and his mulberry plantation, rendered him
the laughing
stock
of his neighbours,
nor could he ever gain even the
interest
of the money he had laid out upon them;
while the
foresters
who had
settled
at their
own
expense
, grew rich and became
respectable
.
He had indeed, the benefit of
their trade, which kept his journeymen
at work, and obliged him to enlarge their
number; for the
foresters
had a
respect
for their old
master
and landlord, and
when they had any thing to
sell
, they
always
let him have the
refusal
of it, and
bought all their goods of him. But
though he called
himself
their father, and
his wife their mother, yet he began to
abate
of his parental affection for them;
and rather looked on them with a jealous
eye, as if they were aiming to deprive him
of his claim and
set
up for independence.
Had he been contented with the profits of
their trade, as was certainly his
interest
,
they might have remained his tenants to
this day; but ambition, avarice,
jealousy
and choler, inflamed by bad
counsellors
,
have wrought
such
a
separation
, that it
is thought Mr. Bull will go mourning all
the remainder of his days, and his grey
hairs will be brought down with
sorrow
to the grave.
LETTER VIII.
Mr.
Bull's
quarrel and
lawsuit
with
Lewis
and Lord
Strut
.
He gains
possession
of the whole
Forest
.
DEAR SIR,
In
my former letters I have
endeavoured to trace the
several
steps
by
which the
forest
became cultivated and
peopled. Mr. Bull had no
less
than
fourteen tenants who held under him, and
were
settled
on lands which he claimed as
his own, and which he had granted to
them in
separate
parcels. Their names,
and the enigmatical letters by which they
distinguished
themselves
, were as follows:
Alexander Scotus,
N. S.
Robert Lumber,
N. H.
John Codline,
M.
Roger Carrier
R. I.
Humphry Ploughhare,
C.
Peter Bullfrog,
N. Y.
Julius Cfar,
N. J.
Caimir,
D.
William Broadbrim,
P.
Cecilius Marygold,
M.
Walter Pipeweed,
V.
Peter Pitch,
N. C.
Charles Indigo,
S. C.
George Truty,
G.
It
was
observed
, that of all the
adventurers
,
those
generally were the
least
thriving
, who received
most
assistance
from their old
master
. I cannot tell
whether it was owing to their being
employed
in
business
to which they had not
served
a regular
apprenticeship
, or to a
natural indolence, and a
disposition
to
continue hangers on where they had got
a good hold; for it
must
be noted, that
Mr. Bull was very generous to
some
persons
,
and on
some
occasions
where it
suited
his fancy, and this
disposition
in him
I 2
was
so
prevalent, that they who kenned
him, and would humor his whims, could
work him out of any thing which they had
a mind to.
On
the other hand,
those
adventurers
who came into the
forest
on their own
hook, and had no
assistance
at all from
their old
master
, nor any thing to help
themselves
with, but their four limbs and
five
senses
, proved to be the
most
industrious
and thriving, and after a while told
up a good
estate
. They all
seemed
to
have an affection for Mr. Bull, and it was
generally believed to be
sincere
. His
house
was
usually
spoken
of by them as
their
home
. His ware
house
was the
centre
of their traffic; and he had the
address
to
engross
the profits of their labour
and draw their earnings into his own fob.
To
some
of them he would now and then
make a
present
, to others he would lend a
pack of his hounds,
[44]
[44]
Station
ships
and regiments.
when he was out of
the humor of hunting; but they were
generally
useless
to them for the
purpose
of
scouring
the woods,
those
who could
afford it kept dogs of their own, who were
better trained to the game, and could
better
scent
the
forest
, being native curs, and
not
so
spruce
and delicate a breed as Bull's
grey-hounds.
It
has been before
observed
, that each
end of the
forest
was occupied by Bull's
rivals. His old neighbour Lewis had got
the north end, and Lord Strut the
south
.
Bull's tenants had
seated
themselves
chiefly
on or near the
shore
of the lake, and had
not extended very far back,
because
of the
beasts
of prey; but Lewis, like a cunning
old fox, had formed a
scheme
to get
footing
in the interior parts of the country,
and prevent
these
planters from
penetrating
beyond the limits which he intended
to
assign
them. His
emissaries
had been
sent
slily
into the
distant
parts of the
forest
,
under pretence of taming
these
beasts
of prey; but in fact they had halved the
matter with them, and had
themselves
become as
savage
as the
beasts
had become
tame. They would run, leap and climb
with them and crawl into their dens,
imparting
to them a lick of
melasses
out of
their
calabash
, and teaching them to
scratch
with their paws the
sign
of a
cross
.
They had built
several
hunting lodges on
the
most
convenient
passes
of the brooks
and ponds, and though thus
scattered
in
the wood, were all united under one
overseer
,
called Onontio,
[45]
[45]
The governor of Canada.
who lived in
the
mansion-house
of St. Lewis's Hall.
It
was matter of wonder among Bull's
tenants, for
some
time, what could be the
reason
that the wild
beasts
had grown
more
surly
and
snappish
of late than
formerly
;
but after a while,
some
hunters
made a
discovery
of the new lodges, which
the
emissaries
of Onontio had erected, and
the
design
of them being apparent, a
general
alarm was
raised
in the plantations.
On the
first
news, Walter Pipeweed
sent
his
grandson
George
,
[46]
[46]
Washington
, 1753.
a
smart
, active,
lively
youth,
across
the hills, with his
compliments
to the intruders,
desiring
them to
move off, and threatening them with a
writ in
case
of non compliance. This
modest
warning being ineffectual, it was
thought that if an
Union
could be formed
among the tenants, they might make a
stand
against
these
encroachments. A
meeting was held at
Orange Hall
,
Albany, 1754.
but no
efficient plan could be hit on, without a
previous application to their landlord,
who hearing of this meeting, conceived a
jealousy
with regard to this
union
which
seemed
to be their object, and thought it
was better to retain the management of
the matter in his own hands, and keep
them divided among
themselves
, but
united
in their dependence on him. He
therefore
sent
them word that he had a
very great affection for them, and would
take care of
their
interest
, which was
also
his own;
that he would not
suffer
old
Lewis to
set
his half tamed wild
beasts
upon them, nor eject them from their
possessions
,
but that he would immediately
take advice of his council, learned in the
law, conjuring them by the affection which
they
professed
to bear towards him, to be
aiding and
assisting
in all ways, in their
power, towards bringing the
controversy
to an
issue
.
At
this time, the
steward
, to whom
Mr. Bull
entrusted
the care of his
business
,
was not a
person
of that
discernment
and expedition which the exigency of
affairs
required. He had committed divers
blunders in his accounts, and it was
suspected
that he was a defaulter in more
respects
than one. It cannot, therefore,
be expected, that in conducting a
controversy
of this magnitude, he
should
exactly
hit on the right methods, nor employ the
best
council which could be had. The
first
step
which was taken was to
send
Broadoak
[47]
[47]
Braddock, 1755.
the bailiff, with a writ of
intrusion
,
which he was ordered to
serve
volens nolens
, upon one of the
messuages
or hunting
seats
of Lewis. This bailiff,
proceeding
rashly
and
against
the
best
advice
into the
forest
, not a
step
of which he
was acquainted with, found his
progress
impeded in a way wholly unexpected.
For Onontio had taken care to place a
number of his half tamed wild cats and
wolverenes on the boughs of trees, which
hung over the path, and as
soon
as the
bailiff came within reach, having
first
wetted their tails with their own urine,
they
whisked
it into his eyes till they
blinded him. This manuvre put a
stop
to the
process
for that time.
Several
other attempts of the like
kind were made without
success
, and
Lewis
at one time had
almost
got
possession
of
Orange Hall
.
1757.
Not only the
foresters
themselves
, but even Bull's own
domes
tics, complained bitterly of
these
ineffectual
measures
, and their clamors at
last
prevailed to make him
discharge
his old
steward
, and put another into his place.
The new officer
[48]
[48]
Pitt's
administration
.
soon
changed the face of
affairs; he employed no attorneys, nor
bailiffs, but
those
of tried and approved
abilities, men of enterprize and
resolution
,
by whom the
suit
was
prosecuted
in good
earnest
. In every action Bull recovered
judgment, and got
possession
. When
Lord Strut came in to the aid of Lewis,
Bull
cast
him
also
, and took away his
manor
of
Augustine
, which, with the whole
tract of land, where Onontio
presided
,
was annexed to his
estate
. The agents
who had been employed in this arduous
service
, were not only well paid for doing
their duty, but, with the
steward
, who
employed
them, were honored according to
the ancient, but
whimsical
custom
of Bull's
family, by having their effigies portrayed
on
sign
boards, pocket handkerchiefs,
snuff
boxes, and punch bowls;
so
that while
the fit
lasted
, you could not walk the
streets
, nor blow your
nose
, nor take a
pinch of
snuff
, nor a draught of punch,
but you were obliged to
salute
them.
Whenever
Bull's
steward
called
upon
the
foresters
for their quotas of aid,
towards
carrying on this heavy
lawsuit
, they
always readily afforded it; and
some
of
them were really
almost
exhausted
by the
efforts which they made, to do
more
than
their
share
. The
steward
was
so
sensible
of their merit, that on due
consultation
with Mr. Bull's wife, and her taking him
in the right mood, he was prevailed upon
to
reimburse
the extra
expense
to them,
and mutual complacency reigned between
the landlord and tenants all the time this
steward
remained in office. But
these
times were too good to
last
long; there
were
some
who envied the
steward
his
reputation, and
raised
stories
to his
disadvantage
,
which highly affronted him. At
K
this time Mr. Bull was
so
much off his
guard, as to give heed to
these
reports,
and take a
rash
step
in a hurry, which he
had
occasion
to repent of at his
leisure
.
He accepted the
resignation
of this
trusty
servant
, and put one of his
[49]

sister
Peg's
cast
off footmen into his place; whereby
he laid a foundation for his own
disgrace
,
and the
dismemberment
of his
estate
, of
which I
shall
give you a particular
account
hereafter.

LETTER IX.
Mr.
Bull
gets into debt, and by the
advice
of his new wife and her gambling
companions, begins a quarrel with his
tenants
.
DEAR SIR,
To
trace with
precision
all the
causes
, great and
small
, which operated to
the
dismemberment
of John Bull's
estate
,
would be no
easy
task
;
some
of them
perhaps
,
were
secret
, but of
such
, as were
open to
observation
, we
shall
endeavour
to
sketch
out the principal.
It
is well known that he was of a
choleric
habit, and that
those
who were
acquainted
with his humor and
passions
,
could manage and
impose
upon him at
their
pleasure
. Had he been let alone to
pursue
his own
business
himself
, his plain,
natural good
sense
, and
generosity
of
mind, would have kept him clear of many
difficulties; but he had his
advisers
, his
hangers on, his levee hunters, his toad
eaters, and
sycophants
, forever about him,
who, like a parcel of blood
suckers
, could
never have enough to glut their voracity.
When
the
forest
was
first
occupied by
the tenants, Bull had a wife
[50]
[50]
Parliament.
who minded
her own
domestic
business
, and did not
concern
herself
with his landed
interest
.
The
leases
and grants were made out in
his
name, and he was
supposed
to be the
owner or proprietor; but the lady whom
he had married after his
second
sickness
was very
assuming
, and
insisted
on having
her
hand in the management of
all
his
affairs
.
She
visited
the compting
house
,
and made the clerks
shew
her their books;
she
overhalled the
steward
's accounts, and
inspected
his
correspondence
;
she
not
only looked after the rents and incomes
of the
forest
, but even intruded into the
household
concerns of the tenants, and
affected to call
herself
their mother
,
because
she
had taken
some
care of one or
two of them in their
first
fetting out,
although
most
of them
scarcely
ever had
seen
her face, or had any acquaintance
with her, but by
hearsay
.
It
must
be
observed
,
also
, that this
woman had engaged Mr. Bull in
some
expensive
lawsuits
and
speculations
, which
had got him deeply into
debt
, and he was
obliged to hire money of
usurers
to
carry
her
schemes
into execution. Had
she
,
at the
same
time, introduced that
frugality
and economy into the family, which
her duty ought to have prompted her to,
this debt might have been kept down;
but the
swarm
of harpies which were
continually
about her, and the
course
of
gambling which was carried on under her
connivance and direction,
swallowed
up
all the profits of the trade, and incomes
of the land; while the luxury and
dissi
K 2
pation of the family
in
creased
, in
proportion
as the means of
discharging
the debt
de
creased
. In
short
, Mr. Bull was
reduced
to that humiliating condition, which,
by whatever
fashionable
name it may now
go, was formerly called
petticoat-government
.
During
the
lawsuit
with Lewis and
Lord Strut,
[51]
[51]
War of 1756.
concerning the
forest
, there
had been a great
intercourse
with the
tenants. Many of Bull's
servants
and
retainers, who were employed as bailiffs
and attornies, and their deputies, had
been very
conversant
with them, and were
entertained at their
houses
, where they
always
found
wholesome
victuals, jolly fire
sides
, and warm beds. They took much
notice of every thing that
passed
,
asked
many
questions
, and made many remarks
on the
goodness
of the land, the
pleasant
situation
of the
houses
, the clean and
thriving condition of the children, who
were always ready to wait them, to clean
their boots, hold their
stirrups
, open and
shut
the gates for them, and the like
little
necessary
services
, as well bred children
in the country are wont. The remarks
which
these
persons
made, when they got
home, favored rather of envy, than of
gratitude or affection. Some of them
would
say
:
Those
fellows live too well
in the
forest
; they thrive too
fast
; the
place is too good for them; they ought
to know who is their
master
; they can
afford to pay more rent; they ought
to pay for the help they have had; if it
had not been for
Master
Bull, and the
assistance
which he has lent them, they
would have been turned out of doors;
and now they are to reap the benefit of
his exertions, while he, poor man, is to
pay the
cost
.
There
were not wanting
some
, in the
families of the
Foresters
themselves
, who
had the
meanness
to crouch to
these
fellows
,
and
supplicate
their favour and
interest
with Mr. Bull, to recommend them
to
some
posts
of profit, as
understewards
,
collectors of rent, clerks of receipts, and
the like pretty offices.
These
beggarly
curs would repeat the
same
language, and
hold
correspondence
with the bailiffs,
attornies
,
&c. after they had got home.
Whenever any trifling quarrel happened
in the families of the tenants, they would
magnify it and fill their letters with
complaints
of the
licentiousness
of the people,
and plead for a tighter hand to be held
over them.
Such
speeches
as
those
were
frequently
made, and
such
letters read, in the
hearing
of Mr. Bull's wife and
steward
.
Their language grew by degrees to be
the current language of the family, and
Bull
himself
listened
to it. His choler
rose
upon the
occasion
, and when his
hangers on
observed
it, they plied him
with
stronger
doses
, till his
jealousy
and
hatred were excited, and a complete
revolution
in his temper, with regard to
his tenants, took place, agreeably to the
most
sanguine
and malevolent
wishes
of
his and their enemies.
The
first
effect of this change was, that
his clerks were ordered to charge not
only
the prices of the goods, which the
tenants
should
purchase
, but to make them
pay for the
paper
[52]
[52]
Stamp act, 1765.
on which their bills of
parcels and notes of hand were written,
and that at a very exorbitant rate. This
was
so
intolerable an
abuse
, and withal
so
mean, pitiful, and beggarly an expedient
to pick their pockets, that they held a
meeting among
themselves
, and
resolved
not to buy any more of his goods, as long
as this
imposition
lasted
; and by way of
contempt, they hanged and burned the
effigies of the
steward
, and other
persons
who were
suspected
of having
advised
to
these
new
measures
.
The
resentment
shewn
by the tenants
on this
occasion
was quite unexpected.
The
secret
favourers, and real authors of
the
mischief
, began to be afraid that they
had gone too far for the
first
attempt.
Bull's journeymen were in an uproar
about
it, left by the failure of his trade,
they
should
be out of bread; and to
shorten
the
story
, he was obliged to give
up the point of making them pay for the
paper, though
Madam
had the
singular
modesty
to make a declaration, that it was
a mere matter of
expediency
, and that
she
had the
sole
power and right of dominion
over them,
notwithstanding
Mr. Bull's
most
gracious
concession
at that time.
[53]
[53]
Repeal of the
stamp
act, and declaratory act, 1766.
This
was
considered
by the tenants as
a
most
impudent and barefaced
assumption
;
for whatever rights Mr. Bull might
pretend to have, as their old
master
and
landlord, yet they never had any idea of
a
mistress
over them; and though they
very
complaisantly
returned him their
thanks for his
present
goodness
, yet as
they
suspected
that there was more
mischief
hatching, they began to inquire more
narrowly than ever into his right and
title
to the land, on which they lived.
They looked over old parchments and
memorandums,
consulted
council learned
in the law, and after due deliberation,
they were fully convinced, that
their own
title was, at
least
, as good as his, and that
they had a right to
refuse
him any rent or
acknowledgment, if it were prudent for
them to
exercise
it.
Mr
. Bull's
jealousy
was now
increased
with regard to their intentions, and his
scribbling
retainers frequently
accused
them of ingratitude and
disobedience
, and
a long premeditated
design
to
set
up for
independence; a thing which they had
not yet thought of, and probably never
would, if this
abusive
treatment had not
put it into their heads.
But
though by
those
means they were
led into an inquiry, and a train of
thinking
,
which were quite new to them; yet
as old habits are not
easily
broken, and
their affection for their
master
was very
strong
, they endeavoured, with a candor
which did them honor, to transfer the
blame from him to his wife and
steward
,
to
whose
machinations they knew he was
a dupe.
These
bad
counsellors
soon
renewed
their attempts in another
shape
, by
raising
the rent, and putting an advanced
price upon the goods, and by means of
additional clerks, packers, porters,
watchmen
,
draymen, &c. who were continually
in waiting, and to all of whom fees were
to be paid, the trade laboured under great
embarrassments
, and
some
of the
foresters
were quite
discouraged
, others were vexed
and impatient, while
some
of the better
tempered of them, endeavoured to
persuade
the
rest
to keep up the
communication
as long as they could. They were
loth to quarrel with their old
master
, and
yet could not pocket the affronts and
abuses
to which they were daily
exposed
.
During
this
sullen
interval, many
letters
passed
, many books and precedents
were examined, and much ink was
shed
, in
a
controversy
, which, however incapable
of a
decision
in this way, might have been
compromised
, if Mr. Bull's
first
thoughts
had been as good as his
second
; but he
was
so
completely under management, as
not to
see
his true
interest
. It was a
common
saying
among his neighbors, John
Bull's wit comes afterward; and in fact
it did not come in this
case
, till too late,
for, when a
cause
once gets into the law,
there are
so
many quirks,
evasions
,
demurs
,
and
procrastinations
, that it is
impossible
to make a retreat, till one or both
of the parties have
severely
smarted
for
their temerity.
L
LETTER X.
Mr.
Bull
attempts a new mode of traffic
which
disgusts
his tenants.They
refuse
to receive his
presents
.His
singular
resentment
against
John Codline
,
and the effects which it produced
.
DEAR SIR,
I SUPPOSE you are by this
time impatient for the
story
of the
lawfuit
;
how it began and how it was carried
on and ended. I will give it to you as
briefly as
so
long and intricate a matter
will bear to be told; and I am
apprehensive
you will think that Mr. Bull was
so
ill a politician, or
so
badly
advised
, as
actually
to pick a quarrel with his
best
customers
.
But facts will
speak
for
themselves
.
Know then, that by the advice of
his dear wife and her gambling junto, Mr.
Bull was prevailed upon to
send
a dozen
pounds of tea to each of his tenants,
as a
present
, in token of his extreme good will to
them, and
because
he knew that they loved
it, and at the
same
time to order his clerks
to charge
three pence
per pound for the
paper and pack thread in which this
exhilarating
weed was wrapped. This
trifling
sum
he expected would be paid on
demand, in acknowledgment of their good
will to him as their kind and generous
landlord, who had protected and defended
them
against
all
opposers
, and would
still
continue to protect and defend them as
his beloved children and obedient humble
servants
.
The
knowledge of his intention
happened
to come to them
sooner
than the
present
, and they began to argue thus
among
themselves
Ha! how comes
this? What is freer than a gift? If Mr.
Bull really intends the tea as a prefent,
why does he exact three pence? Had he
offered it to us as an article of
merchandise
as
usual
, we might have taken it if we
had liked the price, or left it if we had not;
but this is a new way of trading to which
we have not been
accustomed
. There is
a
design
in this. If we receive this
present
and pay the trifling acknowledgment
of three pence, by and by we
shall
have a
present
with
six
pence annexed, and
another
with a
shilling
, and
so
on. If we once
establish
a precedent there is no
knowing
where to
stop
, and by
these
presents
we may be gulled out of all our
loose
corns, and afterwards our real
estates
may
be demanded! No, it is better to prevent
an evil than to cure it. We will have
none of your
presents
, Mr. Bull, if this
is to be the
consequence
. We have paid
our debts wellyou have had the
exclusive
benefit of our trade, and have
become
rich by it, and now in your old age
you are grown
trickish
It is time for us
to be on our guard and keep a
sharp
look
out, for if a man does not take care of
himself
who can he expect will take care
of him? Fortified with
these
arguments
they waited for the approach of the
messengers
which were on the road with the
present
.
One
of them came to Charles Indigo's
house
, and with Mr. Bull's compliments
begged his acceptance of a package of
teaThrow it into that cellar,
said
Charles, and let it lie there till I have
considered
of the matter.
Another
came to William
Broadbrim
but
as the way to William's
mansion
was through a long, crooked, miry
lane, he had ordered the porter to
stop
him, and give him liberty to return
without
delivering his
message
.
Peter Bullfrog
did the
same
, but
some
part of the tea being
smuggled
into
the
house
, as
soon
as Peter knew it he
threw it into the gutter.
L 2
John Codline
had the
greatest
difficulty
about Mr. Bull's
present
. He
would gladly have
sent
back the
messenger
,
but unluckily for him the gate which
led to his
house
was held
fast
by Bull's
under
steward
, who
constantly
watched
and attended there to
observe
who went
in and out, which
service
he was more
particularly fond of,
because
he expected
a douceur for opening and
shutting
the
gate. Having admitted the
messenger
and received his
penny
, he
stiffly
refused
to let him out again without having
delivered the
present
. The
see
was
tendered, but this could not prevail; the
family were
uneasy
, they were loth to
assront
Mr. Bull, and yet determined not
to receive his
present
. They could not
account for the conduct of the
understeward
on any other principle than this,
that he expected to get a
share
of the
three pence
per pound, and of all other
profits
arising
from future
presents
; and
was afraid he
should
lose
it if he let the
messenger
return. The family was called
together in the chapel, where they held a
long
consultation
,
sent
several
messages
to the under
steward
, who held
fast
the
gate, and finally
refused
to open it. They
were driven at length to an extremity and
threw the tea into the vault, where it
perished
, at the
same
time
protesting
that
the whole blame ought to be charged on
the under
steward
, as they had no
intention
of injuring Mr. Bull if they could
have avoided it.
As
soon
as this was known in Mr. Bull's
family, his wife fell into a violent
hysteric
fit, and in her raving phrenzy denounced
all the vengeance which it was in her
power to execute, on
these
refractory,
ungrateful
tenants, who would not accept a
present
when it was
so
freely offered to
them. But when
she
came a little to
herself
,
she
was
persuaded
by her gambling
companions not to attempt any thing
against
the whole body of the tenants,
lest
they
should
be driven by
necessity
to form
an union among
themselves
, which might
defeat the plan;
she
therefore
proposed
to
Mr. Bull to
single
out
one
of the
most
refractory
of them, and
shew
his
resentment
in a particular manner to
him
, hoping
that the others would be intimidated and
let him
suffer
alone, and be glad to get off
so
well
themselves
. The
person
singled
out for the object of
resentment
was John
Codline, and the mode of
resentment
was
as ridiculous as it was malicious, for it was
nothing more nor
less
than to
send
a
bailiff
,
with a pack of blood hounds, to
stand
before the great gate that led to the
front
of his
house
. This, it was thought, would
strengthen
the authority of the under
steward
who had the key of the gate, and
would reduce the family to this dilemma,
either to receive no company and carry
on no
business
, or
else
to
submit
to Mr.
Bull's new mode of trading.
The
reason
assigned
for this particular
mode of revenge was, that Mr. Bull, as
lord of the manor, claimed a kind of
sovereign
right to the high way. He had
for a long time exacted an
acknowledgment
from all
passengers
; whenever they
happened to meet any of his
horses
or
carriages
on the road, whether he was there
himself
or not, they were obliged to
douse
the hat, or they might be
sure
of receiving
a
stroke
of the whip, if not of being run
down by his
servants
, who had
special
orders
not to let any
omission
of this nature
pass
unpunished
.
In
consequence
of this manuvre on
the part of Mr. Bull, every
person
who
had any
business
to do with John Codline
was
stopped
in the road, and ordered to
go back, or
pass
by like the
Priest
and
Levite, on the other
side
. However,
those
who had a mind to
see
him, found
means to climb over the fence, or to go
up a narrow lane, which, by the help of a
stile
and a foot path, led them to
Codline's
back door.
This
species
of
punishment
exposed
Mr. Bull to the ridicule of all his
neighbors
.
It
also
proved quite ineffectual to
the
purpose
for which he
designed
it.
Instead
of hindering company from coming
to Codline's
house
, it brought more; and
he received many letters from
those
who
could not come in
person
. But, what was
of more
service
to him than letters or
visits
was this, that many who were indebted
to him came and made payment, and
those
who had at various times received
favours from him when they were in
distress
,
sent
him
presents
, and encouraged
him to keep up a good heart,
promising
to
stand
by him to the
last
extremity, if
he
should
be reduced to it.
It
has been
observed
, that one
advantage
which Mr. Bull expected would
arise
from this
specimen
of his
refined
policy
was, that it would
disunite
the tenants,
and frighten
some
or perhaps all the
others
into a compliance with the new mode
of traffic. This expectation was
grounded
on one of the Fables of
Esop
, which
relates, that a fox who had been caught in
a trap, and
disengaged
himself
by the
loss
of his tail, whenever he appeared among
the foxes, was the object of their ridicule;
upon which he endeavoured to
persuade
them that he had been travelling to learn
fashions
, and that the
newest
fashion
was
for foxes to cut off their tails as a
useless
and
burdensome
appendage, and
boasted
how much more light and nimble he had
become
since
he had parted with that
encumbrance
;
to which an old fox replied,
that if he would do
justice
to his
argument
he ought to produce the
shears
with
which he had cut off his tail, for the
conviction
of his brethren.
This
fable, and the moral couched
under
it,
raised
a great deal of vain
expectation
and triumph in the family of Mr.
Bull; but the
foresters
had another of
their own making, which was a match for
it. A man meeting a
serpent
in the field,
struck
at him with a
stick
, and there being
but one in his view he thought to kill him
immediately; but the
snake
set
up
such
a
hiss
as brought a dozen more out of their
holes, who attacked the proud murderer
in front, rear, and flank, and obliged him
to take to his heels for
safety
. This fable
was
so
much admired among the
foresters
at that time, that they had an engraving
made on all their
message
cards, of a
wounded
serpent
, with this motto,
Join
or die
.
Adieu
.
LETTER XI.
The quarrel begins in
earnest
and is carried
into the Law.Conduct of the Managers
on both
sides
.The
first
verdict in
favour
of the
Foresters
given at
Saratoga
Hall
.
DEAR SIR,
The
insult
which the
foresters
supposed
to be put on them by the
obstruction
of the road, as mentioned in my
last
,
caused
a
serious
alarm, and induced
them to call a meeting of the heads of the
several
families to
consult
for their own
safety
. The
result
of this meeting was to
endeavour by all peaceable means in their
power to effect an accommodation; but
if that
should
fail, to prepare, in the
best
manner they could, to
assert
and maintain
their rights,
possessions
and properties.
M
In
prosecution
of the former part of
their plan, they wrote letters to Mr. Bull,
and to
several
members of his family;
and with
respect
to the latter part, they
came to a
resolution
to buy nothing more
of him till he
should
change his mode of
conduct, and treat them as he had
formerly
done.
In
the letters which they wrote on this
occasion
, though they
professed
a great
deal of
respect
and affection for the old
gentleman
himself
; they
omitted
to
send
their compliments to his wife. This was
more than madam could bear. She
therefore, after
consulting
with her
gambling
companions, determined upon the
two following points;
first
, that no
answer
at all
should
be given to the letter;
and
secondly
, that an action at law
should
be entered, and the tenants ejected from
their
possessions
. She would not
however
have come to this latter
determination
,
if
she
had not been
assured
by
persons
who pretended thoroughly to
understand
their family
secrets
, that the
foresters
would not dare to defend their title in
law;
but on the
first
appearance of a
legal
process
, would
submit
to any terms of
accommodation which her
ladyship
might
think proper to
impose
. Full of this
idea,
she
roundly
swore
that
she
would
see
them
prostrate
at her feet
, before
she
would make up the matter with them on
any terms whatever.
Influenced
by her
passions
, Mr.
Bull's choler
rose
to the
highest
pitch.
As lord of the manor, he placed bailiffs
and blood hounds in the high way, and
denied all
passage
to any
persons
without
his
license
. He then called upon all the
counsellors
and attornies to whom he had
given a retaining fee, and who were very
numerous, to exert all their learning and
eloquence in maintaining his
cause
,
promising
them not only a regular payment of
their
sees
, but a generous allowance for
disbursements
and incidental charges, to
be paid at
sight
by a draught on his
banker.
These
sagacious
gentlemen, many of
whom were of Madam's own junto,
finding
that they had a fat client, contrived
to
husband
the job
, and
spin
out the
cause
secundum
artem
. They were old
prosicients
in the
science
, and knew very well
how to take double receipts of their
stationers
,
bailiffs,
messengers
, and other
retainers
,
i. e.
one receipt for the exact
sum
paid, and another for
double
the
same
sum
;
these
latter were always produced
as vouchers in the
settlement
of accounts,
and in the glorious uncertainty of the law
were admitted under the name of
duplicates
.
It would divert you to
see
the
numberless
items
which they crouded into
their bills of
costs
, and the various pleas
and pretences which were formed for
demurring
and continuing the
cause
from
one
session
to another; while they were
feeding their client with the hope that in
every
next
session
it would be decided.
On
the other hand, the
foresters
finding
that Mr. Bull had retained
so
many
learned
counsellors
,
sergeants
and
barristers
in his
service
, and that he had by far the
longest
purse
, were obliged to
use
the
greatest
economy in conducting their
defence
.
On looking round to
see
who was
the
most
prudent, the
most
deliberate, and
the
most
determined among them, and to
whom they might with
safety
commit their
cause
, they
unanimously
pitched upon
Walter Pipeweed
's
grandson
George
; who,
being elected their chief attorney,
modestly
accepted the office on this generous
condition
,
that they
should
not
insist
on his
receiving
any fee or reward,
because
he
conceived
that in
serving
them he was doing
no more than his duty. This
instance
of
magnanimity was interpreted by them as
a
sure
omen of
success
.
M 2
George
was a man of good
understanding
and true
spunk
; he had made
considerable
progress
in the
study
of the
law for his own
amusement
, and had
practised
at the bar in the defence of his own
family claims
against
the encroachments
of old Lewis. His abilities were of
such
a nature as to
rise
and
shine
with the
opportunities
which called them into action.
This was
also
the
case
with divers other
persons
in the families of the
foresters
;
who would perhaps never have thought
of engaging in the
study
of the law, had
not this
controversy
been agitated; but
would have remained in the
state
which is
thus elegantly
described
by the poet.
Full many a gem of
purest
ray
serene
,
The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;
Full many a flower is born to
blush
unseen
,
And
waste
its
sweetness
on the
desart
air.
This
circumstance
was predicted in the
hearing of Mr. Bull's wife, by a very
learned and
honest
gentleman, who would
have
dissuaded
her from giving her
husband
such
bad advice as to plunge
himself
into that deep ditch, the law, out
of which there is no coming till the
last
farthing be paid. If there are any
seeds
of genius,
said
this faithful
adviser
, they
are drawn into action by public ferments
and troubles; but might have remained
in time of tranquillity forever
useless
and
unknown, perhaps at the plough, under a
shed
, or among the
lowest
class
of
mechanics
.
[54]
[54]
Vide Debates in Parliament, March 16, 1775.
This
sage
hint was totally
disregarded
,
because
, as I before
observed
,
too much confidence was placed in a
set
of
advisers
, who pretended to know all
the family
secrets
of the
foresters
. But
the prediction was fully verified when this
lawsuit
brought to the bar one from his
farm, and another from his
merchandise
,
one from his
shed
, and another from his
shop
,
This
circumstance
gave
occasion
to the following
bagatelle
, written, as is
supposed
, by
some
disaffected
or perhaps
disappointed
wag, in one of the
families
.
till in fact they became a match,
in point of numbers at
least
, for the
whole
host
of Mr. Bull's attornies.
The
first
action was brought
against
John Codline, who was deemed the
most
surly
and refractory of the whole number.
It was thought if he could be
cast
, the
others would of
course
submit
. In this
way of proceeding, Mr. Bull acted like that
species
of dog which bears his name, and
which is known to attack his enemy by the
head.
The
cause
was learnedly argued at the
Court of
Bunker hall
, and the arguments
in favour of the
foresters
made a very
unexpected
and very deep
impression
on the
managers for Mr. Bull. They found it a
much more
serious
affair than they had
imagined, and thought it
best
to
stop
short
and have the
case
hung up
, that they
might
consult
their books over again, and
prepare
themselves
by better authorities
and allegations at the next hearing.
After
a long time they contrived to
shift
their
ground
,
[55]
[55]
March, 1776.
and let John alone. They
advised
Mr. Bull to
send
for
some
lawyers
out of Germany, who had been more
used
to this game, and to lay an attachment on
the
estate
of Peter Bullfrog, and the farm
called C
sarea
; where they expected to
gain
some
greater advantage, partly
because
the tenancy was different, being
founded on
courtesy
and not on
lease
, and
partly
because
of the diffentions which
they heard were
subsisting
in
these
families
.
In this interval
also
Madam Bull's
resentment
was
raised
so
high, that
she
swore
point blank that not one of
these
refractory
scoundrels
should
enter her
husband
's doors nor have the
least
connection
with him, but that
she
would drive
them off from the land, and repeople the
forest
with another
set
of men.
When
they had heard of this
resolution
,
the heads of all the families in one
of their
consultations
, came to a
determination
to
publish
an
advertisement
,
setting
forth the various
abuses
and grievances
which they had
suffered
from Mr. Bull,
his wife, and her junto; and declaring
that they looked upon the country as
their
own
, and
themselves
as free from any
obligations
to him, and at liberty to look out
for other markets, and invite other
merchants
to form connexions with them.
This
transaction
was
so
important an era
in the
controversy
, that the
fourth of July
,
the day on which the
advertisement
was
dated, has ever
since
been celebrated as a
day of
festivity
. The morning of that
anniversary
is
ushered
in with a firing of
guns and fluttering of pigeons. At noon
you may hear
some
young lad
spouting
a declamation in favour of free trade;
which is generally followed by a bowl of
punch and a rump of beef, and the day is
concluded with a
song
and a dance.
In
the
progress
of the action,
several
points of law were argued at different
times with much
skill
and learning. On
one of
these
occasions
George was
reducto
a dilemma, and his opponents thought
him
absolutely
silenced
; but
suddenly
recollecting
himself
, he
rose
superior
to
them,
[56]
[56]
Trenton, 1776.
and compelled them again to
move for a continuance. Thus the
cause
was kept
suspended
till the
third year
was
almost
closed
. At length a vaunting
braggadocio of a
barrister
on Mr. Bull's
side
, who thought to carry all before him,
was
so
completely
answered
and
confuted
in an
obstinate
argument, that a verdict
was given at
Saratoga
hall in favour of
those
plantations, which had been
sued
for in the northern part of the manor.
This verdict relieved the
foresters
in
some
degree, and it was hoped would prove a
good precedent for the
decision
of the
other
suits
which were meditating
against
their brethren in the
southern
part.
The
unfortunate
barrister
was
severely
reflected on by Mr. Bull's wife, for not
doing his duty; and he was obliged to
justify
himself
by producing his
instructions
,
and by telling a number of
serious
truths
respecting
the
forest
and the
foresters
,
which Mrs. Bull had often heard
before
but would not believe. The
relation
of
these
truths was
so
very
offensive
,
that
she
influenced her
husband
never
more to employ him; and as he could get:
no other
business
in the law, he has
since
betaken
himself
to writing plays and
romances
.
See folly on a
losty
seat
,
And humble
wisdom
at her feet!
On
horseback
see
the beggar ride,
With princes walking by his
side
.
Pale
Crispin
has his
last
foregone,
To
serve
himself
and
save
his town;
And Snip the taylor's
shears
are
lost
,
Because
he's got a higher
post
.
So have I
seen
the kitchen pot,
When
set
on coals
profusely
hot,
Throw up its
sediment
to
scum
,
While bubbles dance
amidst
the foam.

Lewis

request
Alarm in
Mr.
Bull's
familyHis conference
with his wifeHer manuvres upon
the
occasion
Disappointed
by the
inflexibility
of the
Foresters
.
DEAR SIR,
You
may well
suppose
that a
three years
lawsuit
was a very
expensive
undertaking on both
sides
; and you will
wonder how the
foresters
,
circumstanced
as they were, could
struggle
with
such
an
antagonist
;
especially
when the high way
was
so
obstructed
that they could not
carry
their
provisions
to market to procure
them
cash
. The truth is, that though
they were
served
gratis
by their prime
counsellor
, yet they were obliged to give
promissory
notes to the attornies,
scriveners
,
bailiffs, and
messengers
, whom they
employed under him; but as the
prospect
of payment was
distant
, the notes
passed
at a
discount
, and the only remedy
in their power was to
issue
more
, which
instead
of
lessening
increased
the
difficulty
.
They
had early
foreseen
this difficulty,
and applied privately to Mr. Lewis, Mr.
Frog, and Lord Strut, to borrow money
on
interest
.
These
old curmudgeons,
though each of them looked with an
envious
eye on Mr. Bull, and
secretly
wished
he might
lose
the
cause
, yet were
induced
by various
considerations
to evade
the
question
proposed
to them by the
foresters
. We
must
,
said
they, keep
up appearances with our old neighbour;
we have accounts open with him, as well
as claims upon
some
portions of land, to
which our title is no better than his; we
may draw
ourselves
into a
scrape
, and fet
our own tenants a bad example, for who
knows but the
same
arguments may avail
with them to
refuse
their rents to us?
Besides
,
how do we know whether
these
fellows
will ever be able to pay? They
offer
to mortgage the manor to us, but the
title is yet in
dispute
, and how do we know
whether it be theirs or Mr. Bull's?
These
were the
secret
reasons
which
induced
them to evade a direct
answer
to
the
messengers
; and, like true courtiers,
To
squeeze
their hands, and beg them come
to-morrow
.
But
as
soon
as the verdict was given at
Saratoga hall, they began to change their
mind, and
wish
not only to make them
debtors, but even to enter into contracts
to a large amount.
Mr
. Lewis was the
first
to make
advances
,
and meeting the
messengers
one
day on 'change, he
accosted
them thus:
Your
servant
gentlemenI congratulate
you on your
success
; you are welcome to
my
house
, and
warehouse
, and table. I
will lend you a few livres to help you to
finish
the
controversy
; and if Mr. Frog
will advance a few
stivers
, I will give him
my bond for
security
.
Besides
, I will
consent
that my own
counsellors
,
barristers
,
and attornies, whom I have retained,
shall
assist
you at the next
session
, and I
will
see
if I cannot open the high way,
that you may bring your produce to
market
.
When you
see
Lord Strut, give my
compliments to him, and tell him what I
have
promised
, and I dare
say
he will,
out of
friendship
to
me
, and for the
sake
of our old
family compact
, give you
some
assistance
; for look ye, gentlemen, I will
be
honest
with you, I mean to promote
my own
interest
by
serving
you, and I am
sure
he has the
same
meaning.
This
change in the
sentiments
and
language
of Mr. Lewis was immediately made
known to Mr. Bull, by means of
some
running
sootmen
, who frequently carried
N 2
news from one
house
to the other.
Consternation
seized
the whole family, and
Mrs. Bull
herself
began to think it a very
serious
matter, and that it was
necessary
to do
something
immediately to prevent
worse
consequences
. She therefore held
a
curtain
conference with Mr. Bull on
the
subject
, thus
Mrs. B.
Well, my dear, what do you
think of the conduct of your neighbour
Lewis?
Mr. B.
Why I think he is a
deceitful
dog and means to ruin me. If
these
fellows get him for their friend, he will
draw in Lord Strut and Nic Frog, and I
shall
have them all to contend with at
once; and therefore I think we had
better
compromise
the matter with the
tenants
and let them take the land, if they
will, and go to the Dl; why
should
I
keep on throwing away good money after
bad; I am damnably in debt now, and
I
wish
to
stop
where I am, without getting
any deeper into the law.
Mrs. B.
I agree with you, my dear,
that he is a deceitful dog, and I
wish
the
tenants could know his true character; if
they did, I am
persuaded
they would not
put any confidence in him. There is a
number of very
sensible
persons
among
them, and by the
discourse
which I have
had with
some
who know their
secrets
, I
believe that means might yet be found to
divide
them, and to
detach
them from the
interest
of Lewis; and if you will let me
manage the matter, I have no doubt that
I
shall
be able to
accomplish
it.
Poor
John
setched
a deep
sigh
, and
said
inwardly
Ah, I have let you manage
my matters
so
long, that you have
almost
brought me to ruin! Then
raising
his
voice and wiping his eyes, he replied, Well,
my dear, I have told you
my
mind plainly,
but if you think you can do any thing to
save
me, pray be
speedy
; I would gladly
keep the tenants attached to me, for the
benefit of their trade, which is a matter of
more
consequence
than their rent, and if
I
should
finally
lose
the land, I
wish
to be
again connected with them in
business
.
Mrs. B.
Never fear, I do not doubt
but we
shall
find means to keep the land
and have the trade too. I know how to
sweeten
them and bring them to good
humour again.
As
soon
as this conference was ended,
she
wrote a billet in a very
complaisant
stile
,
but in a hand
scarcely
legible,
[57]
[57]
1778.
and was in
such
a hurry to
send
it, that
she
could not
wait for one of the clerks to copy it,
prefenting
Mr. and Mrs. Bull's compliments
to the gentlemen tenants, informing them
that it was not intended to trouble them
any farther for the payment of paper and
pack thread, which had been the
occasion
of the
controversy
; but to
settle
all
matters
by a reference, and that
suitable
persons
should
soon
be deputed to confer
with them, or any of them, on the
premises
.
This billet was hurried away by an
express
, and actually arrived before the
foresters
had heard of Mr. Lewis's
intended
kindness
to them. But they
received
it with contempt, and gave no
other
answer
to it than this, Let Mr.
Bull withdraw his action and clear the
road, and we will talk with
him
; but as
to
his wife
, we will have nothing to do
with
her
.
After
they had given this
answer
,
word was brought them of the good will
of Mr. Lewis, which was received with
the
greatest
joy imaginable. He was
accounted
the
finest
gentleman in the whole
country, and all the
stories
which they
had heard of him through the medium of
Bull's family, were
set
down as lies. He
was regarded as the protector of the
injured
,
the helper of the
distressed
, and
the friend of the rights of mankind.
While
the
praises
of Lewis were thus
echoed from
house
to
house
, the deputies
of Madam Bull arrived. They were
instructed
by her
ladyship
to enter into free
conversation
with the
foresters
, or any of
them, publicly or privately; to tell them
that they were greatly deceived if they
took Mr. Lewis for their friend; that he
was an arch, fly, deceitful fellow, and that
no
trust
ought to be put in him; that
Mr. and Mrs. Bull were very amicably
disposed
toward them, and willing to
forget
and forgive all that was
past
, to renew
the former
intercourse
, to take off all the
charges and burdens which had been
complained of; to help them pay the
debt which they had incurred by the
lawfuit
;
and as the
greatest
proof imaginable
of Mrs. Bull's particular favour to them,
she
would admit any of them to
visit
her in her own drawing room, and give
them a
seat
at her card table. As a token
of her
sincerity
in
these
professions
,
she
sent
several
presents
to their wives and
daughters, and gave the deputies a large
purse
of money to be
distributed
privately
among the
most
insluential
persons
in the
several
families.
The
deputies had
scarcely
alighted
before
they
sent
their footman to the door
of the
house
where the heads of the
families
were
assembled
, with a
message
of
compliments to announce their arrival,
and
ask
permission
to make a friendly
vifit
.
The porter
refused
entrance to the
footman, and he returned, without having
delivered his
message
. The deputies then
wrote the purport of their errand and
sent
it to the porter, who delivered it, and the
following
answer
was returned
Gentlemen
, we cannot hear any
invectives
against
our good friend Mr.
Lewis. If your
master
is in
earnest
, tell
him that he
must
withdraw his action and
clear the road. This is all from your
humble
servants
,
The
Foresters
.
Disappointed
and chagrined, but not
wholly
discouraged
, the deputies
attempted
privately to get into
some
of the
houses
; but they were
refused
entrance.
They wrote letters and threw them in at
the windows, or put them into the key
holes, but all to no
purpose
. The
firmness
and inflexibility of the
foresters
astonished
them, and they were obliged to
return with aching hearts, and tell their
master
and
mistress
that the
forest
was
lost
forever.
And
now was verified the old
saying
,
Earth has no
curse
like love to hatred turn'd;
Hell has no fury like a woman
scorn
'd.
But
Madam's fury and its
consequences
,
will be the
subject
of my
next.

DEAR SIR,
Nothing
could exceed the
rage into which Mrs. Bull was thrown by
this
disappointment
. O
these
cursed
,
stubborn
, ungrateful,
disobedient
wretches
,
to
refuse

spurn
at my offers of

!
What, not admit my deputies into

off the land! And as to that deceitful dog
of a Lewis, I will
raise
such
a hornet's
nest
about his ears, that he
shall
repent
his bargain! If Lord Strut attempts to
help him, I'll lay an attachment upon his
richest
farms. And as for Nic Frog, if
he lends them money, I will break up his
warehouse
, and
sell
all his goods by
auction
.
I will
satiate
my vengeance on the
whole pack of them, and if I fall
myself
among the general wreck, I
shall
have the
glory of dying like Samfon in the ruin of
my enemies.
The
rage which Mrs. Bull indulged
on this
occasion
, and the
noise
which
she
made in her raving fits,
raised
a great
alarm
in the family, and as
hysterics
are
said
to be catching,
so
the
distemper
spread
into the two next families, viz.
into
those
of
sister
Peg and brother Patrick.
The former imagined that it was Mr.
Bull's intention to call in Lord Peter to
his aid,
because
he had been of late
somewhat
complaisant
to
those
of his natural
children, which
resided
in the family;
and the latter expected that he
should
be
treated in the
same
manner as the
foresters
,
because
he had complained of
some
restraints
and
impositions
from his brother
John Bull, in
respect
to his trade and
business
,
which was that of a linen draper.
Old
jealousies
and grudges were revived
on this
occasion
, and the whole
neighbourhood
was in
confusion
. The dogs in
Peg's family kept a
constant
howling and
barking, and were
answered
by
those
of Mr.
Bull. Several of them actually ran mad,
[58]
[58]
Protestant
association
, 1779 and 1780.
and Bull was obliged to place guards at
his doors and gates, who attacked the curs
with clubs and killed
several
on the
spot
.
In the
midst
of this hurly burly, his
house
was
set
on fire, and was actually
seen
blazing in thirty
six
places at once;
[59]
[59]
Lord G. Gordon's mob.
the
fire even penetrated madam's drawing
room, and her card party were obliged to
hand buckets and pump the engine; and
it was not without the
greatest
exertions
that the whole
mansion
was
saved
from
utter
destruction
.
A DIFFLCULTY
also
arose
from another
quarter, where it was little expected.
The
measure
which Mr. Bull had
adopted
of
stopping
the high way provoked all
the neighbours, who thought it a great
infringement of their common rights;
but as he was a
person
of
so
much wealth
and power, they were afraid openly to
contest
that point with him. At length
an elderly widow lady, of large property,
with whom he had always lived on friend
O 2
ly terms, and who generally went by the
name of Madam
Kate
, took the liberty to
tell him, that
she
could no longer
suffer
her neighbours and
herself
to be
so
imposed
upon; that the high way was
common
to all; that he had no right to
stop
passengers
and examine them, but that
every body ought to go about their
lawful
business
without let or hindrance, and
that
she
was determined to form a
combination
[60]
[60]
Armed neutrality formed by the
Empress
of
Russia
, &c.
with Mr. Frog, Mr. Lewis,
Lord Strut, and all the other neighbours,
to remove the incumbrances which Mr.
Bull had thrown in the way, and clear the
passage
.
This
combination extended to other
objects,
besides
clearing the high way.
They were all
disposed
to help the
foresters
against
Mr. Bull, though in different
ways. Lewis had already lent them
money and feed lawyers to plead for them.
Lord Strut, though rich in landed
interest
,
yet generally anticipated his revenues,
(or as the vulgar
phrase
is, ate the calf in
the cow's belly) he therefore had no
money to
spare
; but to oblige his friend
Lewis, he laid an attachment on a
southerly
corner of the
forest
, which formerly
belonged to him, and which from the
numerous
flowers with which it abounds,
had got the name of
Terra Florida
. At
the
same
time he attached one of Mr.
Bull's favourite hunting
seats
,
[61]
[61]
Gibraltar.
which
commanded an
extensive
prospect
, and
was
situate
extremely convenient for
hunting, fowling, and
fishing
. It had
formerly belonged to Strut, but he had
foolishly
lost
it by
staking
it in a game of
whist
, which he played with Mr. Bull. It
was a doubt in law whether real
estate
could be held by
such
tenure, but Bull
had
possession
, and that you know is
eleven
points of the law. At any rate, it
would oblige Bull to defend; and that
would
cost
him money, and divert
some
at
least
of his lawyers from the
business
of
the
forest
.
A SECRET
correspondence
had for
some
time been carried on between the
foresters
and Mr. Frog, for a loan of
cash
and a mercantile contract. Bull had
suspected
it, but could not prove it, till one
night, his myrmidons caught a
messenger
from the
forest
and
searched
his pockets,
[62]
[62]
Capture of Mr. Laurens.
in which were found certain letters and
other papers, which were
supposed
to
amount
to full evidence.
Upon
this
occasion
an
advertisement
was
published
, according to
fashion
,
justifying
the
measures
about to be taken, and
deploring the evils which were connected
with them. However
small
a
share
of
credit
these
publications obtain, it is
generally
as much as they
deserve
.
To make
short
work with Frog, Mr.
Bull got a
search
warrant, and
sent
a
bailiff
to his
richest
warehouse
,
[63]
[63]
St.
Eustatius
.
who entered
it,
per fas aut nefas
, tumbled over the
merchandise
under pretence of
searching
for
stolen
goods; and having taken away
as many as he
pleased
, by a writ of
venditioni
exponas
, he put them up at
auction
,
and it is
said
made a fortune by this
job. Mr. Lewis was
so
exasperated
at
the outrage thus committed on his friend
Frog, that by a writ of
scire
facias
he
laid claim to the ware
house
and its
contents, and brought in Bull for
damages
.
In
short
, Mr. Bull now found
himself
soused
over head and ears in that deep
ditch, the law. Like
Ishmael
of old,
his hand was
against
every man, and
every
man's hand
against
him. Look which
way
soever
he would, he found enemies,
and his own family were continually
buzzing
in his ears that he would bring his
affairs to ruin.
By
the
assistance
derived from the loans
which they had negotiated with Lewis
and Frog, and the additional
counsellors
and attornies which Lewis employed for
them, the
foresters
pursued
the
controversy
with as much vigor as the forms,
delays, and uncertainty of the law would
permit. No
less
than four years longer
were
consumed
in this
expensive
quarrel,
and Mr. Bull's numerous retinue of
lawyers
were employing
themselves
in the
various chicanery and
tergiversations
of
their
profession
, all the while fattening on
the profits of the
suit
;
whilst
his debt
was growing at
such
a rate that he was at
his wit's end to keep the
interest
from
accumulating
as well as the principal. At
length, by a capital manoelig;uvre of
Pipeweed's
grandson
George, aided by the
counsellors
of Lewis, the
cause
was
brought to a hearing at
York
court, and
the arguments were of
such
efficacy that a
second
verdict
was given in favour of the
foresters
, with large damages. This
verdict
came
so
near to a final
decision
, that
all Mr. Bull's friends were convinced he
could no longer maintain an action
against
the
foresters
; and
some
trusty
old
servants
ventured to
whisper
in madam's ear
that it was high time to end the
controversy
,
for that it could not
possibly
be
carried any farther without bringing the
family and the trade to total ruin.
Look
ye, madam,
said
they, how all
the
schemes
which you have laid have
been uniformly defeated; you have
professed
to know the family
secrets
of
these
foresters
; but
those
fellows who
pretended
to give you this information have
deceived
you. In fact they have no
such
secrets
as your
ladyship
imagines. What
has been
openly
told you all along is the
truth, and you ought long ago to have
believed
it. Now the conviction has
forced
itself
upon you, and you can no longer
withstand
it. The
foresters
have been
defending their title in the law, and they
have made it appear
so
plainly, that no
jury in the world will ever give a verdict
against
them. All who are acquainted
with new lands know that the labour
attending
the improvement of them is worth
ten times more than the land; and in fact
gives the
best
title to it. If our
master
will now end the matter by a
compromise
,
he may yet
save
some
part of the manor
at the northward, where is the
best
of
hunting and
fishing
; but if he
pursues
the
matter any farther he will
lose
it all.
These
faithful
remonstrances
, enforced
by the
necessity
of the
case
, began to have
some
effect on the turbulent mind of
madam. She
saw
that it was in vain to
contend
against
the opinions of all
mankind
,
and therefore in her next curtain
lecture
she
held a
short
dialogue with Mr.
Bull, thus
Mrs. B.
My
dear, I have been
thinking
whether it would not be
best
for you
to come to a
settlement
of this long
controversy
.
Mr. B. (groaning inwardly)
So
then
you have changed your mind, have
you?
Mrs. B.
Yes
, my dear, I find I have
been deceived with
false
information, or I
would never have
advised
you to
prosecute
the matter
so
far.
Mr. B.
Well
, but how like a fool
shall
I appear to the world, if, after I have
threatened and hectored
these
fellows,
and
spent
so
much money to recover my
right, I
should
give it up at this time of
day?
Mrs. B.
Why
you know, my dear,
that you have formerly made
concessions
to them,
because
I judged it
expedient
.
P
Mr. B.
Ay
, then I retained my claim
of
right;
but that will not do now
Mrs. B.
True
, my dear, you
must
give up your right and title to about two
thirds of the
forest
; but you may
still
hold the other third, and I dare
say
nobody
will
contest
your right to that. And
as for that part which you give up, you
may
say
by it as old Lewis did of that
which you once took from him. Hang
it, it is not worth the keeping; it has
always
been a bill of
cost
to me, and the
like.
Mr. B.
I wish
, my dear, you had
given me this advice
some
years
sooner
, I
should
have
saved
my money and my
credit too.
Mrs. B.
Why
, my dear, I tell you I
was deceived; I am as
sorry
as you are
for the
loss
of the money and of the
forest
,
but as the
case
is now
circumstanced
, I
think a
compromise
would be
best
.
Mr. B.
Well
, I will
consider
of it.
When
Mr. Bull had taken the matter
into
consideration
, he thought it
best
to
wait the
issue
of the
suit
with Lord Strut
about the hunting
seat
, for he was loth to
lose
that; and happily for him, when that
cause
came to tryal, it was argued
so
forcibly
by his lawyers, that Strut was obliged
to give it up. As
soon
as Bull heard of
that, he cried out, Now is the moment
of victorynow is the time for peace.
So calling one of his clerks, Here,
says
he, go and
settle
the matter with the
foresters
,
or their deputies, on the
best
terms
that you can. The deputies and the
clerk
soon
came to an agreement, and a
quitclaim deed was drawn,
describing
the
butts and bounds of the
forest
, and
distinguishing
what he gave up to them from
what he retained. This quitclaim being
properly
engrossed
, he with a trembling
hand and aching heart
subscribed
it,
while madam,
standing
behind him,
could not help
shedding
a tear at the
sight
of a
transaction
to which
she
would
never have
consented
but from dire
necessity
.
LETTER XIV.
The
Foresters
form a
partnership
.It
proves deficient and ineffectual.Their
Clock out of order.Their
strong
box
empty.
Disturbances
in
some
of the
families.A meeting is called to
revise
and amend the
partnership
.
DEAR SIR,
I was
loth to break the thread
of my narration in my former letters, and
you know that we prattling folks love to
tell our
stories
in our own way, which we
are under great advantage to do when we
are writing letters. But I will now go
back to tell you
something
of the manner
in which the
foresters
managed their
domestic
affairs during the
controversy
with
Mr. Bull, and for
some
time after it was
closed
.
P 2
When
they had broken their
connexion
with him, it was uncertain what
connexions
they might form abroad, but it
was judged expedient for them to be
united
among
themselves
, that no one
family
should
connect
itself
in trade with any
merchant or factor, without the
consent
of
the others. In
short
it became
necessary
for them to enter into a
partnership
for
their mutual
interest
and convenience.
To do this was a nice point, and
required
much delicacy. It was to them a new
subject
, and they had an untrodden path
before them. After much
consultation
and inquiry, their ingenuity
suggested
to
them the idea of an original
social
compact
.
Why
should
we,
said
they, look
abroad for precedents, when we have
enough
among
ourselves
? See the
beavers
in our own brooks and meadows, how
they work in complete
partnership
, each
family has its own cell, and a number of
cells are placed in one pond. They
carry
on their operations with peace and
unanimity
,
without even the appearance of
a
master
. Here is a perfect republic, a
complete equality, a
striking
example of
order without
subordination
, of liberty
without
jealousy
, of
industry
without
coercion
,
of economy without
parsimony
,
of
sagacity
without overbearing influence.
Every one knows his own
business
and
does it, their labour goes on with
regularity
and decency; their united efforts
serve
the common
cause
, and the
interest
of
every
one is involved in that of the whole.
Let us go and do
likewise
. The hint
took, and a plan of CONFEDERATION, as
it was called, was drawn up on principles
of the
purest
equality; each family
retaining
the entire control of its own
domestic
concerns, without any interference
of the others, and agreeing to contribute
voluntarily
its proportion of labour and
money to
support
the common
interest
.
This
was, in theory, a very pretty
device
,
exactly
suited
to a
set
of people who
thought
themselves
completely virtuous.
But as it often happens that great
ingenuity
exists
without much judgment or
policy,
so
it proved here.
These
foresters
did not
consider
that their intellects
were not, like
those
of the beavers,
confined
to a few particular objects; that
they were not like the beavers, void of
passions
and prejudices, void of ambition,
jealousy
, avarice and
self
interest
. With
all the infirmities and vices of humanity,
they were expecting to
establish
a
community
on a plan
similar
to that in which
no
such
deformities can
possibly
find
admittance
.
Though
for a while, and during the
period of the
lawsuit
, when common
danger
impelled them to keep
themselves
close
together, this plan
answered
the end
better than none; yet
in fact
the notion
of
independence
had
so
intoxicated their
minds, that having
cast
off their
dependence
on Mr. Bull, they thought
themselves
independent of all the world
beside
.
When they had got entirely clear of the
controversy
with him, they were in the
condition of a young heir
just
come of
age, who feels proud of his freedom, and
thinks he has a right to act without
control
.
Each family felt its own
importance
,
and expected a degree of
respect
from the others in proportion to its
numbers
,
its property, its exertions, its
antiquity
,
and other trifling
considerations
,
which ought never to have had any place
in a
partnership
of complete equality;
and in
consequence
of this intoxicating
idea of independence, each family claimed
the right of giving or withholding its
consent
to what was
proposed
by any or all
of the others.
In
the club room, among a number of
ingenious devices, there was a clock, of a
most
curious and intricate
construction
,
by which all the common concerns of the
partnership
were to be regulated. It had
one
bell, on which
thirteen
distinct
hammers
struck
the hours. Each hammer
was moved by independent wheels and
weights, each
set
of wheels and weights
was
enclosed
in a
separate
case
, the key of
which was kept, not as it ought to have
been, by the
person
who
represented
the
family at club, but in each
mansion
house
;
and every family claimed a right either to
keep the key at home or
send
it to club,
when and by whom they
pleased
. Now
as this clock, like all other automatons,
needed frequently to be wound up, to be
oiled and cleaned, a very nice and
particular
adjustment
of
circumstances
was
necessary
to
preserve
the regularity of its
motions, and make the hammers perform
their functions with propriety.
Sometimes
one or two of the hammers would
be out of order, and when it came to the
turn of one to
strike
it would be
silent
;
then there
must
be a running or
sending
home for the key, and the
houses
being at
a
considerable
distance
, much time was
spent
in waiting. Sometimes the
messenger
arrived at an
unseasonable
hour, when
the family was
asleep
, or abroad in the
fields, and it would take up a
considerable
time to collect them, and lay the
case
before them, that they might deliberate
and determine whether the key
should
be
sent
or not; and before this could be
done, the clock would get more out of
order
.
By this means, the club was
frequently
perplexed; they knew neither
the hour of the day, nor the day of the
month; they could not date their letters
nor
adjust
their books, nor do
business
with any regularity.
Besides
this there was another
inconvenience
.
For though they had a
strong
box, yet it was filled with nothing but
bills of parcels and accounts
presented
for
payment, contracts of loans and
indentures
for
services
. No money could be
had from any of the families but by their
own voluntary
consent
; and to gain this
consent
there was great difficulty. Some
had advanced what they
supposed
to be
more than their proportion; others had
paid
less
. The former would give no
more till the latter had made up their
quotas, and there was no authority which
could call any one to account, or make
him do his duty. Their whole
estates
were mortgaged for the money which they
had borrowed of Mr. Lewis and Mr.
Frog; and yet they could carry on no
business
in
partnership
. In fact they had
formed
such
an unheard of kind of
partnership
,
that though they could run
themselves
in debt, yet they could not
oblige
one another to
raise
any money to
discharge
their debts.
Each
family however carried on a
separate
trade, and they contrived to
undersell
each other, both at home and at
market. Each family
also
had a
separate
debt, which
some
were providing means
to
discharge
, and others neglected. In
one or two of the families they went to
loggerheads among
themselves
. John
Codline's family was for
several
days a
scene
of
confusion
and
disorder
; nothing
was
seen
or heard but
cursing
and calling
names, kicking
shins
and pulling
noses
.
John at
first
tried to
silence
them by
gentle
means, but finding
these
ineffectual,
he at length drew his
scymitar
, and
swore
he would cut off the ears of the
first
that
should
dare to make any more
noise
.
This threatening drove two or three
turbulent
fellows out of doors, after which
the
house
was tolerably quiet.
Something
of the
same
kind happened in
Robert
Lumber's family, but he made
so
good
a
use
of his
fist
as quelled the
disturbance
at once.
In
the family of Roger Carrier there
seemed
to be a predominant lurch for
knavery, for he publicly
advertised
that
he was ready to pay his debts by notes of
hand
subject
to a
discount
, the amount of
Q
which was indefinite,
because
continually
increasing
; and that whoever did not take
his pay when thus offered, might go
without
.
The other families were alarmed at
his conduct; but had no power to oblige
him to deal
honestly
, and he carried his
roguery
so
far as to bid them all
defiance
.
In
this
state
of debility and
distraction
,
it became
necessary
to
consult
on
some
measures
for a better plan of union.
They began to be convinced that they
were not
beavers
, nor capable of
subsisting
in
such
a
state
of
society
as had been
adopted from them. Something more
energetic was wanted to compel the lazy,
to check the
knavish
, to direct the
industrious
,
and to keep the
honest
from being
imposed
upon. It had been often in
contemplation
to amend the mode of
partnership
;
but now the
disorders
in
some
of
the families became
so
alarming, that
though they had been quelled for the
present
, it was uncertain whether they
would not break out again,
especially
as
one whole family
seemed
determined
openly
to
patronise
roguery.
These
confiderations
served
to
hasten
the change
which had been contemplated. It was
accordingly moved in the club, that each
family
should
appoint one or more
persons
to meet together, and
consult
upon
some
alterations and improvements in the
partnership
. This meeting was
accordingly
held, and the
result
of it
shall
be the
subject
of my next letter.
Adieu.
LETTER XV.
A new plan of
partnership
is
proposed
.
Arguments pro and con.It is
established
.A
Chief Steward appointed, with
inferior officers.Hunting too much in
fashion
.A new
species
of rats
introduced
.Two
families added to the
number
of apartments
.
DEAR SIR,
It
is not in my power to give
you a particular detail of the whole
proceedings
of the meeting which was held
to reform the plan of
partnership
in the
manner of your parliamentary
journalists
,
who make
speeches
for the members,
perhaps
better than
some
of them make for
themselves
; but I will endeavour to give
you a
summary
of the principles on which
they proceeded.
The
professed
design
of the meeting
was to reform and amend the plan; but
in fact when they came to examine it they
found
themselves
obliged to
pass
the
same
sentence
on it that was once delivered
concerning the famous poet, Alexander
Pope,
whose
usual
ejaculation was,
Gd
mend me!
Mend you,
said
a hackney
coachman, (looking with contempt on his
dwarfish
form and hump back) it would
not be half
so
much trouble to make a
new one.
A NEW one was accordingly entered
upon, and the fundamental principle of it
was, not to
suppose
men as good as they
ought to be, but to take them as they are.
It is true,
said
they, that all men are
naturally free and equal; it is a very good
idea, and ought to be
understood
in every
contract and
partnership
which can be
formed; it may
serve
as a check upon
ambition and other human
passions
, and
put people in mind that they may
some
Q 2
time or other be called to account by
their equals. But it is as true that this
equality is
destroyed
by a
thousand
causes
which
exist
in nature and in
society
. It
is true that all
beasts
, birds, and
fishes
are
naturally free and equal in
some
respects
,
but yet we find them unequal in other
respects
, and one becomes the prey of
another. There is, and always will be,
a
superiority
and an inferiority, in
spite
of
all the
systems
of
metaphysics
that ever
existed
. How can you prevent one man
from being
stronger
, or
wiser
, or richer
than another? and will not the
strong
overcome
the weak? will not the cunning
circumvent the
foolish
, and will not the
borrower become
servant
to the lender?
Is not this noble, free, and independent
creature man,
necessarily
subject
to lords
of his own
species
in every
stage
of his
existence
? When a child, is he not under
the command of his parents?
send
him
to
school
, place him out as an apprentice,
put him on board a
ship
, enrol him in a
company of militia,
must
he not be
subject
to a
master
? Place him in any kind
of
society
whatever, and he has wants to
be
supplied
, and
passions
to be
subdued
;
his active powers need to be directed, and
his extravagances to be controled, and if
he will not do it
himself
,
some
body
must
do it for him. Self government is indeed
the
most
perfect form of government in
the world; but if men will not govern
themselves
, they
must
have
some
governors
appointed over them, who will keep
them in order and make them do their
duty. Now if there is in fact
such
an
inequality
existing
among us, why
should
we
act as if no
such
thing
existed
? We have
tried the
beaver
scheme
of
partnership
long enough, and find it will not do. Let
us then adopt the practice of another
kind of
industrious
animals which we
have among usLet us imitate the
bees
,
who are governed by one
supreme
head,
and under that direction conduct their
whole economy with perfect order and
regularity.
On
this principle they drew up an
entire
new plan, in which there was one
chief
steward
, who was to manage their
united
interest
, and be
ressponsible
to
the whole for his conduct. He was to
have a kind of council to
advise
and
direct
him, and
several
inferior officers to
assist
him, as there might be
occasion
; and
a certain contribution was to be levied on
the trade, or on the
estates
of the whole,
which was to make a common
stock
for
the
support
of the common
interest
; and
they were to erect a tribunal among
themselves
,
which
should
decide and determine
all differences. If nine of the families
should
agree to this plan, it was to take
place; and the others might or might not
adopt it; but if any one
should
finally
refuse
, or if any
should
adopt it and
afterward
fall from it, he was to be looked
upon as an
outcast
, and no
person
was to
have any connection with him.
The
meeting having continued a long
time, every body became extremely
anxious
to know what they were about; the
doors were kept
shut
, and no
person
whatever
was let into the
secret
till the whole
was completed. A copy was then
sent
to
each family for them to
consider
at their
leisure
.
Though
curiosity
was now gratified,
yet anxiety was not relaxed. The new
plan of
partnership
went by the name of
the fiddle;
those
who were in favour of it
called
themselves
fiddlers
, and
those
who
opposed
it were
stiled
antifiddlers
. The
former
said
it was the
best
plan that
human
wisdom
had ever contrived. The
latter imagined it pregnant with
mischief
of every kind. The former compared it
to a
strong
sence
about a rich field of
wheat. The latter compared it to the
whale that
swallowed
up Jonah.
In
each family a
consultation
was held
on the
question
, Whether it
should
be
adopted
or not? and liberty was given for
every one to
speak
his mind with the
utmost
freedom. The objections,
answers
,
replies, rejoinders, and rebutters, which
were produced on this
occasion
, would
make a curious collection, and form an
important page in the
history
of man.
The
fiddlers
were extremely fond of
having
it examined,
because
they
said
it was
like a rich piece of plate, which the more
it be rubbed
shines
the brighter. The
antifiddlers
said
it was like a worm eaten
bottom of a
ship
, the defects of which
would more evidently appear the more it
was ripped to pieces; they were therefore
for rejecting it at once, without any
examination
at all.
When
they were urged to point out
its defects, they would
say
, It is
dangerous
to put
so
much power into the hands
of any man, or
set
of men,
lest
they
should
abuse
it. Our liberty and property will
be
safe
whilst
we keep them
ourselves
, but
when we have once parted with them,
we may never be able to get them back
again.
If
the plan was compared to a
house
,
then the objection would be made
against
building it too high,
lest
the wind
should
blow it down. How
shall
we guard it
against
fire? how
shall
we
secure
it
against
robbers? and how
shall
we keep out rats
and mice?
If
it was likened to a
ship
, then it
would be
asked
, how
shall
we guard it
against
leaking? how
shall
we prevent it
from running on the rocks and
quick-sands
?
Sometimes
it would be compared to a
clock
, then
question
was, how
shall
we
secure
the pendulum, the wheels and the
balance from
rust
? who
shall
keep the
key, and who
shall
we
trust
to wind it
up?
Sometimes
it was
represented
by a
purse
, and then it was
said
to be
dangerous
to let any one hold the
strings
.
Money is a tempting object, and the
best
men are liable to be corrupted.
In
short
, the whole
sum
and
substance
of the arguments
against
it might be
summed
up in one wordJEALOUSY.
To
shew
the
sutility
of
these
arguments
it was
observed
by the
opposite
party, that
it was
impossible
to put it into any man's
power to do you good, without at the
same
time putting it into his power to do
you hurt. If you
trust
a barber to
shave
your beard, you put it into his power to
cut your throat. If you
trust
a baker to
make your bread, or a cook to
dress
your
meat, you put it into the power of each
to
poison
you; nay, if you venture to lie
in the
same
bed with your wife, you put
it into her power to choak you when
you are
asleep
. Shall we therefore
let our beards grow till they are long
enough
to put into our pockets,
because
we are afraid of the barber? Shall we
starve
ourselves
because
the baker and the
cook
may
poison
us? and
shall
we be
afraid
to go to bed with our wives? Fie,
fie, gentlemen, do not indulge
such
whims: Be careful in the choice of your
barbers, your bakers, your cooks, and your
wives; pay them well and treat them
well, and make it their
interest
to treat you
well, and you need not fear them.
After
much debate and
discussion
,
some
of the families adopted it without
exception, but in others the
opposition
was
so
strong
that it could not be made to
pass
, but by the help of certain
amend
R
ments
which were
proposed
; and of
these
amendments every family which thought
proper to make any, made as many as
they
pleased
. The new plan, with its
appendage of amendments, cut
such
a
grotesque
figure, that a certain wag in one
of the families, like Jotham the
son
of
Gideon, ridiculed it in the following
parable
.
A CERTAIN man hired a taylor to
make him a pair of
small
clothes;
the
taylor
meafured him and made the garment.
When he had brought it home, the man
turned and
twisted
and viewed it on all
sides
; it is too
small
here,
said
he, and
wants to be let out;it is too big here, and
wants to be taken in; I am afraid there
will be a hole here, and you
must
put on
a patch; this button is not
strong
enough,
you
must
set
on another. He was going
on in this manner, when his wife entered
the roomHave you put on the
small
clothes, my dear,
said
she
No,
said
he.
How then, replied
she
, can you
possibly
tell whether they will fit you or not? If I
had made
such
objections to a gown or a
pair of
stays
before I had put them on,
how would you have laughed at my
female
wisdom
? The man took his wife's
advice and faved the taylor a deal of
trouble.
In
like manner, the new plan of
partnership
was
tried on
, and was found to fit
very well. The amendments were thrown
by for future confideration, and if ever
adopted, will be
so
few and
so
trifling as
to make no effential difference.
As
soon
as a
sufficient
number of the
families had adopted the plan, they began
to fet it in operation; and
unanimously
chose
for their chief
steward
and manager,
George, the
grandson
of Walter
Pipeweed
.
He had ferved them
so
faithfully
and
generously
in conducting the lawfuit
against
Mr. Bull, that no
person
was higher
in their confidence. As he would take
no reward for his former
services
;
so
he
began this new
business
with a declaration
of the
same
kind, and a
protestation
that
nothing could have induced him to quit
the
sweets
of retirement for the toils of
public
business
but a
disposition
to oblige
his numerous friends who had united their
suffrages
in his favour. Every one who
knows him is fully convinced of the
sincerity
of his declarations, and he has
perhaps
as large a
share
of the
esteem
and
affection of the people in
these
families as
any
person
ever could expect from a
course
of faithful and friendly offices.
Besides
him there is an under
steward
,
a council of advice, a chief clerk, a
cashier
,
and a
master
of the hounds. The under
steward
is a
person
of a grave deportment,
much reading and
strict
integrity, and was
largely concerned in effecting the
compromise
with Mr. Bull. The council of
advice are
chosen
from the feveral
families
,
and
consist
of
persons
of the
best
education
,
abilities, and popularity. The
chief clerk has the care of the
most
important
papers, and the
cashier
keeps the
key of the
strong
box, which
now
has
something
in it
besides
paper. By his
advice the debts of the company are put
in a fair way of being paid, though
some
grumbling
still
subsists
among
those
who
were obliged to
sell
their notes at a
discount
.
The
master
of the hounds is an
officer, who it was at
first
thought would
have very little
business
; but as the wild
beasls
of the
forest
have of late grown very
troublesome
, it is
supposed
that he will
have his hands full. There is too much
of a lurch for hunting among many of the
foresters
; and
some
have not been
ashamed
to
express
their
wishes
that the
whole race of wild creatures was
exterminated
from the face of the earth. There
are others who
still
continue of the mind,
that
these
animals are a degenerated part
of the
human
species
, and might yet be
recovered
R 2
if proper methods were
used
to
tame them; but it is greatly feared, that
while the rage for hunting continues, all
such
benevolent projects will fail in the
execution.
In
some
late hunting matches,
these
wild animals
discovered
so
much art and
courage, that
several
of the hunters were
laid to
sleep
in the bed of honour; and
the
rest
were obliged to take to their
heels, that they might live to hunt
another
day. Some perfons are of the
mind that it is not
best
to
seek
these
beasts
in their dens, but rather to guard the
fields and take care of the poultry at
home. Others are for
pursuing
them to
the
thickest
shades
of the
forest
, and this
seems
at
present
to be the prevailing
opinion
.
What the
success
of it will be
time
must
determine.
The child that is unborn may rue,
The hunting of that day.
Since
the new
partnership
has been
established
,
husbandry
and trade have
been carried on
briskly
; the
houses
are
full of good things, and the children are
well clad and healthy; but there is one
inconvenience which
usually
attends a
full
house
, and that is, that
rats
are very
numerous, and a
new
species
of them have
lately found their way thither.
[64]
[64]
Sp-c-lrs.
Some
of them are very fat and
sleek
, and are not
afraid to appear in open day light;
though it is
supposed
they burrow under
ground, and have
subterraneous
communications
from
house
to
house
. This is
an inconvenience
against
which no
remedy
has yet been found; though
some
people
,
from their apparent
voracity
, are of
the mind that they will either prey upon
one another, or
else
eat till they
burst
.
I HAD
almost
forgot to tell you that
two new families have lately been added
to the number of partners. One is that
of
Ethan Greenwood
,

a
stout
,
lusty
fellow
,
born in the family of Robert
Lumber
,
but married into that of Peter
Bullfrog
,
from whom, after a long
dispute
, he
has got a good tract of land, which
originally
belonged to his own father, but was
surreptitiously
taken
possession
of by his
father in law. The other is
Hunter
Longknife
,
Keatucky.
he was bred in the family of
Walter Pipeweed, and has a large
share
of
his
spirit
of adventure. Having taken
up his
residence
in the
outskirts
of the
forest
, he has had many a
scuffle
with the
wild
beasts
, who are extremely fond of his
green corn and young chickens, whenever
they can get a
taste
of them.
LETTER XVI.
Present
State of Mr. Bull.His wife and
bis mother.Story of the
everlasting
taper
.Some
account of Mr. Lewis.His
new wife and
cast
off
mistress
.
Conclusion
.
DEAR SIR,
After
giving you
such
a long
detail of the affairs of
these
foresters
, I
will
close
my
correspondence
, for the
present
, with a brief account of the
situation
of the principal
persons
with
whom they are or have been connected,
and whom I have had
occasion
to
mention
in my other letters.
To begin with Mr. Bull. Though he
has given a quitclaim of that part of the
forest
where his old
servants
and
best
customers
have
possession
, yet he retains the
northern part, together with
some
hunting
feats which he
promised
to give up to the
foresters
. The chief produce of this
northern territory is the furs, which are
brought to his
warehouse
and wrought up
by his
tradesmen
.
Notwithstanding
the
loss
of his title to the lands of the
foresters
,
they have not wholly
forsaken
him as a
trader. He keeps his fulling mills at
work, and
supplies
them with cloths of
various kinds, but they feel
themselves
at
liberty either to
purchase
of him or his
neighbours, or to manufacture for
themselves
.
He is rather more
complaisant
to
them in his own
shop
than his factors are
in
some
of his
distant
warehouses
, where
they are not allowed to carry their
produce
to market, nor to receive
cossee
,
cotton
,
and
sugar
, as formerly. However,
they have found out other places where
they can buy
these
commodities without
asking
his
permission
. And as for that
capital article TEA, which was the occa
sion
of beginning the
controversy
, they
now
setch
it directly from the original
warehouse
of old
Cang-hi
, where it is
manufactured. They
purchase
their
silks
and
muslins
of the
first
makers and
dealers
,
and get their wines directly from the
vineyards.
I HAVE before told you that Mr. Bull
formerly
used
to
send
the
ordure
made in
his family to enrich the plantations of the
foresters
; but
since
his quarrel with them
he has been
somewhat
at a
loss
how to
dispose
of it. At
first
he threw it into
the gutter
[66]
[66]
Convicts employed in lighters on the Thames.
before his door. But there
was
such
a large quantity of it, and the
stench
which it
caused
was
so
offensive
,
that this expedient would not
answer
the
end. He then thought of
sending
it to a
place where
some
of his family had been
employed in
botanizing
,
Botany Bay in New Holland.
in hope that by
adding to the fertility of the
soil
, they
would find more encouragement to
prosecute
their inquiries, and that he
should
in time receive
some
rent or
recompense
;
but this
scheme
, like
some
others, the
product of his fruitful brain, has been
hitherto attended with more
cost
than
profit. What will be his next
contrivance
to
dispose
of his ordure no one can
conjecture.
He
has been obliged, in deference to the
opinion of his neighbours, to
sing
small
about
his right to
stopping
the high way;
and it is thought that he will not revive
his
pretensions
to an
exclusive
title to that
kind of
sovereignty
.
As to his
domestic
affairs, his
wife
still
rules him according to her
usual
maxims,
and keeps up her gaming club, where
she
wins and
loses
alternately; but between
the
shop
and the drawing room, there is
enough gained to pay the
interest
of his
debt, though it is not imagined he will
ever be able to pay the principal. This,
like a
millstone
about his neck,
must
finally
sink
him.
You
may
possibly
be curious to know
what is become of his
mother
, whom I
have formerly mentioned to you as
having
had
some
sway
in his family. The
truth is, that
since
he married his
present
wife, the old lady found her influence
decreasing
and retired to her chamber, where
she
has been for many years confined, and
is now wholly bed rid. Mr. and Mrs.
Bull indeed treat the old lady with much
decency, and
suffer
none to intrude upon
her but
such
company as
she
is fond of.
Old Madam has all the infirmities of age
about her. She will not
suffer
herself
to
be touched nor turned in her bed; nor
the room to be aired, nor her linen
shifted
.
She keeps her window
shutters
closed
, and
will not admit the
least
ray of light in her
apartment, but what proceeds from her
own candle, which having been once
dipped
in
consecrated
water, is
supposed
to
S
possess
all the virtues of an
everlasting
taper
.
Now I have
spoken
of madam's taper,
perhaps you will be
amused
with
some
account of it. It is a wax candle of a
common
size
,
set
in an old
fashioned
silver
candlestick
, richly
embossed
and gilt,
but the
rust
and
dust
of it are
so
sacred
,
that it is never permitted to be
scoured
.
The tradition is, that this
candlestick
formerly
belonged to St. Peter, and the
candle
first
placed in it is
supposed
to have
been lighted at the SUN, and by a
mysterious
kind of
uninterrupted
succession
, has
been kept burning ever
since
. By the
light of this taper, old madam reads her
bible and books of devotion, which
always
lie on a table by her
bedside
.
Some
persons
of an incredulous turn
of mind, have pretended to call in
question
this
mystery
; but it is
still
held
sacred
by the old lady, and by
most
of Mr.
Bull's own family. There are
some
even
among the
foresters
of the
same
opinion;
and
such
is the liberality in
these
families,
that no one is
molested
in the indulgence
of any innocent whim, which does not
affect the peace of the families, nor the
interest
of the
partnership
. It was not
long after the
reestablishment
of harmony
between them and Mr. Bull, that
these
persons
sent
two candles in one lantern,
and one in another, to be lighted at this
venerable taper, and dipt in the
consecrated
water. Two of them were
actually
lighted in old Madam Bull's
presence
,
and to her great
satisfaction
. The
other was lighted at a taper
supposed
to
be derived from the
same
original, but
hid under a
bushel
in one of
fister
Peg's out
houses
, it not being permitted
to burn publicly in her family, where the
only candles allowed are of the
manufacture
of Geneva.
There
has been as long a
controversy
between different
opinionists
on this
subject
,
as between the fectaries in Liliput,
about breaking the egg at the big or little
end. But it is
easy
enough to
accommodate
the matter by granting that St.
Peter's
candle, as well as
those
from Geneva,
were originally lighted at the SUN; that
the
same
source
of light is open to all;
and that it is of no
consequence
of what
materials tapers are made, nor in what
kind of
candlesticks
they are placed, nor
by
whose
hands they are lighted,
provided
they
give
so
clear a light as to
answer
the
purposes
of
vision
.
It
remains only that I give you
some
account of Mr. Lewis. The adventures
in his family have been very
singular
. I
formerly told you that he feed lawyers to
plead the
cause
of the
foresters
.
These
subtile
practitioners
soon
found that the
same
arguments which they were obliged
to
use
in favour of the
foresters
, would
apply with equal propriety to the
case
of
Mr. Lewis's own family. He had long
been a widower, and the family was
governed
by a
succession
of kept
mistresses
,
who minded only their
pleasures
and the
enriching of their own relations and
dependants
.
The tenants were
abused
, the
mansion
house
was dirty and out of
repair
,
and though the rents were paid into
the hands of the
steward
, yet much
oppression
and embezzlement, and little
economy
,
were the
constant
topics of
complaint
.
After
the alteration, produced by the
assistance
of Lewis's lawyers in the
forest
,
they began to think it was high time to
do
something
of the
same
kind at home.
The only peaceable remedy which they
could imagine, was to
persuade
Mr. Lewis
to marry a reputable woman, who would
be agreeable to the family. After much
argument he was at length brought to
see
the
necessity
of the
case
; and to prevent
a
lawsuit
, with which they threatened
him, he
consented
to take the wife
[67]
[67]
The National
Constitution
.
which
S 2
they recommended. She is a lady of
good
sense
and polite manners, and treats
him with the
greatest
deference and
propriety
.
She has had the
mansion
thoroughly
repaired, the floors and windows
cleaned, and the walls
whitewashed
, and is
not afraid to let her
inmost
apartments
be
visited
by the
sun
and air. The
building
is now commodious,
wholesome
, and
pleasant
, and the dirty dog kennel,
[68]
[68]
Bastile
.
which
stood
near the door, is
demolished
.
It
is
suspected
by
some
that Lewis
still
has a hankering after his old connexions,
but he
professes
love to his new wife in
the
strongest
terms imaginable. His
cast
off
mistress
has had the audacity to
insult
the newly married lady, and tell her that
she
has no
business
to occupy
her
apartments
;
that all Mr. Lewis's
professions
are
insincere
and that
she
still
possesses
his
heart. If
these
ladies
should
go to
pulling
caps, Mr. Lewis will be in a critical
situation
, as indeed every man is when
two women are contending for him. It
is
said
that
some
of the neighbouring
gentlemen
,
who prefer concubinage to
matrimony
,
have taken the part of the late
mistress
, and
insist
on her
restoration
to
bed and board; but how this matter will
terminate can be decided only by
futurity
.
He
has
also
been very unfortunate in
some
of his
distant
plantations and
factories
.
His black cattle have caught the
horn
distemper
;
some
of his farm
houses
have been burnt, and it is thought that
several
years will intervene before his
affairs
will be
set
to rights.
Thus
, my friend, I have endeavoured
to fulfil my
promise
, by giving you
such
an account as I have been able to procure
of the
foresters
and their connexions. I
assure
you I am extremely delighted with
the country and its improvements, which
exceed by far the expectations of every
person
who travels this way, and has
formed
what he may think a
just
idea of the
country, by
staying
at home and hearing
the reports of others. There is no
possibility
of conceiving what a fine country it
is without actually
seeing
it; I therefore
recommend to you a journey hither, for a
two fold
purpose
, viz. to cure you of the
spleen
, and to convince you how much
human
industry
and ingenuity can
perform
in a
short
time, when nature has
already
done her part toward making a
good country and a happy people.
Yours, &c.
AMYNTOR.
