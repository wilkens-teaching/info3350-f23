NEAL NELSON.
BY J. H. INGRAHAM, E
Q.,
CHAPTER I.
THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
It
was early in the beginning of that
memorable contest which dismembered
a powerful and splendid empire,' and
to which a brave people were driven by
the oppressive measures of the British
ministry, that the following story opens.
Resistance and revolt had taken the
place of petitions and remonstrances;
councils of advicement had been
converted
into councils of war; and men
exchanged the halls of debate upon civil
rights and political oppression for the
tent and the battle field.
The colonies were in arms from Maine
to Georgia.
A national congress had concentrated
into its hand all the authority of
government
.
To reduce the colonies to obedience,
England had sent over immense fleets
and large armies.
Boston was in the possession of an
English force consisting of nearly ten
thousand men; there being besides in the
city about fifteen hundred Tory families,
whose presence and services were of
advantage to the enemy in his operations.
Washington was encamped upon the
hills around Boston, laying siege to it at
the head of an army of fifteen thousand
men. The investment of the British in
the town became closer and closer every
day. The strict vigilance preserved in
blockading every avenue to the country,
cut off all supplies. Intercourse between
the besieged and the main-land was
entirely
suspended, save when a patriot
family, eluding the vigilance of their
English captors, would safely reach the
army and report the increasing distress
of the British army shut up within.
The Americans at length, under cover
of darkness and mist, took possession of
the heights of Dorchester and fortified
them in a single night. The appearance
of these formidable redoubts the next
morning, commanding the city and
harbor
,
convinced General Howe that his
position was no longer tenable unless he
could take possession of these menacing
elevations, It seemed like another
Bunker
Hill pouring down upon him from
the south side of the city; and although
he feared that an attempt to dislodge the
daring Americans from the height might
bring on another sanguinary battle like
that on the attack on Bunker Hill nine
months before, he determined to make
the attack; for there was no alternation
but the instant evacuation of the city.
A storm, however, rendered the
embarkation
and passage of his troops across
the intervening space of water
impossible
;
and before he could safely proceed
on the enterprize the Americans had so
far strengthened their position and
approached
the city so near with fresh
redoubts
,
on which they had mounted
cannon
,
that he saw that he must soon
capitulate
unless he fled to his ships; and this
step he perceived he should speedily have
to take, as the patriots were making
preparations
of an alarming character to
command the channel; when to pass out
with his transports he felt would be
hazardous
in the extreme, if not
impracticable
.
A retreat by sea, open as it still was to
him, however presented great obstacles.
General Howe saw that the embarkation
of his troops would bring upon him the
fire of the American artillery, who would
line the shores; and that the
intelligence
of his flight would probably
expose
the greater portion of his army to
an attack and capture by the van of
Washington's army which would not fail
to press upon his rear.
Under these difficulties Sir William
Howe resolved to call a council of war.
An hour or two after issuing this order,
on the afternoon of the Sabbath, the
fourteenth
of March, he was standing upon
a terrace in the garden of a mansion
which he had made his head-quarters.
It stood
[1]
[1]
And still [1845] stands. The Governor Phillips
Mansion, now No. 11 1-2 Beacon street.
upon Beacon street, near the
site of the present State House, and
commanded
a view of the whole circuit round
Boston. Upon an elevated terrace in
the garden was an arbor, the favorite
resort
of the British General, who was
accustomed
to pass most of the day here
with his telescope at his eye watching
the shores of Roxbury, Cambridge and
Charleston; but for the last few days,
since the night of the fourth of March,
when the redoubts were thrown up like
the work of magic on the heights of
Dorchester, his glass had mostly been
directed towards these formidable
looking
eminences.
By the side of the English General
stood a stout, bluff, full-faced man, about
forty-eight years of age, in the full dress
of a rear-Admiral. The contrast between
the appearance of Howe and this person
was very striking. The figure of the
other was tall and elegant, and although
he had passed his fiftieth year his air was
singularly youthful and his costume
graceful and gay. Every thing about him
betrayed a close observance of the rules
of taste in dress, even to the beautiful
sword-knot of mingled gold and silken
threads that dangled at the bilt of his
sword. His hair was nicely powdered
and tied in a queue, his ruffles were
richly
laced both at the wrists and bosom;
his waistcoat was of the fairest buff and
embroidered with silver; his yellow
top-boots
shone like gold and his steel spurs
glittered with their elaborate polish. His
air and address were easy and yet
haughty
;
and with all his care in dress his
military appearance was striking. He had
served before in America, and had a
distinguished reputation as a soldier as
well as a skilful diplomatist; and had
been selected by the ministry as the
fittest
man in England to command in
chief the hostile operations by land
against the revolted colonies. In
disposition
he was mild by nature and
possessed
that indescribable suavity of
manner
that rendered him pleasing in
intercourse
even with his foes. Yet his
opinion
of the Americans as rebels led him
to pursue against them the war with a
perseverance that exhibited to them only
the sterner military features of his
character
.
The person standing with him on the
outside of the arbor was Admiral
Shuldam
in command of the squadron of ships
of war and transports then lying in
Boston
harbor. He was a large, fleshy man,
and might have sat for a picture of Sir
John Falstaff, save that he wanted the
knight's merry humor in his eye; and
that the peculiar fiery complexion of his
countenance was wanting in that oily
smoothness of rubicundity which can
come only from `good sack.' Admiral
Shuldam loved brandy rather than sack,
and this gave a ruddiness to his face that
seemed to invite tapping. His beard had
not been shaven for a week, Sunday
though it was, and his neckcloth had not
been exchanged in the same time, and
so it had got rolled and twisted under his
fat chin, till, though originally white, it
had now nearly the hue and appearance
of a bite of rope. His hair was without
powder, and stood stifly up all over his
head. His forehead was as tanned and
grained as a piece of old canvas, and he
possessed a nose that had a ludicrous
cock in it, which got him the sobriequet
in the fleet of `Old Snub.' When he
looked at any object at a distance, he
would throw back his head and shut the
eye-lids of his little gray eyes so close
together
that, but for a faint twinkle, just
perceptible, he seemed to have closed
them altogether. His dress was as
slovenly
as his person. His coat was shabby,
and had probably never seen a brush in
the four years and a half that he had
worn it. It had lost a third of its
buttons
and half of a cuff. His breeches
were slouching and loose at one knee,
he wore long blue steekings, but so
negligently
secured that he had every two or
three minutes to stoop with his hand and
give them a pull upward. His shoes were
worn brown for want of polish, and
although
they had each its buckle, the
settings
were more than half lost. His shirt
ruffles were stained filthy yellow by
tobacco juice, and his finger nails
hideous with a permanent segment of
black ! His head was surmounted
by a naval chapeau, oily and weather
worn. In his hand he held a clumsy
ship's spy-glass, covered with old leather,
an instrument as strikingly contrasting
the elegant silver-mounted fieldle escope
which General Howe had at his eye, as
the Admiral himself the military
chieftain
.
`It is very plain, Admiral,' said Howe
after a close scrutiny of the Boston lines
in the curve of the shore, where groups
and parties of men were very busily
engaged
;
`it is very clear that Washington
has made up his mind to make Boston
too warm for me! The rouges are
raising
a new redoubt there a half a mile in
advance of their last!'
`Yes, yes, I see him, confound him,'
observed the Admiral directing his glass
towards the neck. They mean to beat
up until they come fairly along side!'
`I begin to fear the worst, Washington
has shown himself a skilful soldier and a
man by no means to be trifled with, rebel
as he is!'
`If you followed my opinion, Sir
William
;'
said the Admiral `you would once
more embark your three thousand men
and make a night descent upon the flat
below the Dorchester heights! You
could be aboard of them before they knew
of your being within hail, and my life on
it, you would get the best of it!'
`I have not forgotten Bunker's Hill,
This would prove an equally disastrous
affair!'
`Do you call Bunker Hill disastrous?'
demanded the Admiral gruffly.
`We lost in killed and wounded over
a thousand men, the flower of the army!'
`And we took possession of their
redoubt
driving the rebels from it, killing
and wounding five hundred of them!'
`Yet the victory was dearly purchased.
Besides they would not have retreated if
their amunition had not failed! At
Dorchester
they will be better prepared! I
am persuaded that an enterprize like
that attempted against Bunker's Hill will
here fail. The difficulties in the way of
its accomplishment are very numerous
and well nigh insurmountable!'
`If you say the word I will warp three
of my frigates within point blank range
and batter away at them till they are
tired of the sport!'
`The tide would not serve you but
three or four hours as the water is shoal,
and you would probably be grounded
before
you could return. This course I
have thought of and have questioned
pilots
touching the depth of water and
condition
of the tides, and I am satisfied
that it is impossible to do any thing by
such means!'
`You do not then seriously meditate
evacuating the citythe only place of
importance we holdwithout making an
effort to maintain it!'
`I see no alternation. I will be
governed
however by the decision of the
council of war which I have called
together
to meet me this evening. A
second `victory,' as you are pleased to
term it, like that of Bunker's Hill, would
expose the interests of England in
America
to great danger.'
`What danger could a successful
battle
bring to his majesty, I would like to
learn? Are not we hear to fight the
infernal
Yankees when and wherever we
can?'
`True; but we must act with caution.
We must not jeopardize our cause by
rashness. Suppose, even, that I should
embark to night five thousand troops,
(for a man less would not suffice) and
make a successful attack upon the
heights of Dorchester, and the morning
sun should shine upon the flag of Great
Britain waving over its summit?'
`It would be a glorious achievement,
that would crown with honor your
command
,
Sir William, and place a coronet
upon your brow.'
`Success,' pursued the British
General
,
`success the most brilliant would be
as disastrous as defeat. It would require
half the army now in Boston to maintain
the heights after we had seized them.
How can I spare four thousand men out
of but eight thousand and three hundred,
which is all I have fit for duty.'
`My sailors and marines! They are
as good men as yours!'
`True, but these would not give me
in all more than ten thousand effective
troops. Of these, half would, as I have
said, have to be detached to take the
heights and then maintain them against
Washington's army of fifteen thousand
men, besides some six thousand of the
provincial militia that have of late flocked
to his standard. And if you give me your
men, it will leave your ships exposed to
a boat attack from the Americans, who
are as alert as foxes and ready to avail
themselves of every opportunity of
assailing
us Besides holding the city I have, as
you know, to guard the peninsula of
Charlestown, lest the Americans seize a
second time upon Breed's Hill. How,
pray, my dear Admiral, shall I keep the
Heights of Dorchester, the town of
Boston
and the peninsula of Charlestown,
when my present force is hardly sufficient
to keep this place. No, I can't spare a
man!'
`But I tell you, General,' said the
Admiral
warmly, as he constantly paced up
and down the path before the arbour as
if walking his quarter-deck, `I tell you
that the attack ought to be made! A
battle is necessary to save the reputation
of his majesty's arms! The rebels are
beginning to laugh at us and to scorn us
for our long inaction. They even
openly
twit us with your being afraid to
risk your men out of Boston since the
Bunker Hill affair!'
`A
victory
might be desirable to save
the credit of the royal arms, but we are
not sure of a victory. Nor even would a
victory decide affairs in the Province.
It would be risking everything to attempt
the enterprise. If a reinforcement of five
thousand men should enter the harbor to
night in less then twelve hours, I would
possess myself of yonder thronged Heights
or lay my body in its trenchess. As it is
the advantages cannot compensate the
danger! But we will have the whole
affair
discussed in Council. If a majority
of the twenty-one officers who shall there
meet me, decide in favor of an attempt
to dislodge the Americans, I shall not
gainsay it; but when they shall have
heard all I have to say, I am satisfied
that they will agree with me that there is
no alternation left but withdrawing from
the city in the best manner and with as
little delay as possible!'
Admiral Shuldam made no reply. He
was engaged looking through his glass in
the direction of Cambridge, where a
prolonged cloud of dust indicated the
passage of horseman. He evidently heard
every word uttered by General Howe, for
his face expressed displeasure and he bit
his lip with vexation. Howe levelled his
glass in the same direction, and
discovered
that a large party of horse and flying
artillery were moving along the road from
the centre of Washington's position
towards
the left wing at Dorchester. The
cloud of dust extended for full two thirds
of a mile; but only here and there,
through openings in the way-side trees,
were visible the body of men thus moving
onward.
`Washington, you see, Admiral, is
concentrating his troops towards the
Neck. He means to press us closely,
and perhaps try in a day or two to enter
the city by the Roxbury road!'
`More reason that you should make a
movement to meet them!' answered the
seaman, moodily. `But have your own
way. I would sink my ship before I
would surrender or run away from a
Yankee rebel!'
Thus speaking, the Admiral bowed
formally, and began to descend the long
flight of stone steps that led from the
terrace
to the level lawn in the rear of the
house.
`You will meet me at the council,
Admiral,' said General Howe, in a tone
perfectly unmoved by the old sailor's
displeasure.
`No. You know my opinions. Tell the
others what I think! But you will have
it all your own way with your smooth
smile. If you want men to do as you
would have them, you smile, and I
swear! but somehow your dd smile
has the best of it!'
`I see you are convinced I ought not
attack the heights, but don't like to
confess
it, my dear Admiral! I am glad
you are not so vexed as you would have
me think! There is, indeed, nothing to
be gained by remaining in possession of
Boston!'
`Where do you expect to go?' asked
the Admiral, stopping on the fifth step,
and looking back.
`To take possession of New York. It
is more central, is wholly undefended,
there is no American army within three
hundred miles of it, and it is everywhere
a more advantageous central position for
our operations. We do not so much fly
from Boston, dear Shuldam,' added
Howe, laughing, `as we vacate our
position for another more favorable!'
`Well, you would convince the devil
London had'nt a sinner in it! If you
decide
to give up the ship, just let me know
in time and I'll have the transports
ready.'
`You are very good, Admiral. How
many transports are there in all under
your command?'
`About one hundred and fifty great
and small. They are not enought, but
they will hold all your men if they will
lie close?'
`You had best at once get them ready
for sea and provisioned in the best
manner
you are able. I foresee what the
decision
of the council of war will be!
There is little probability that we shall
be here five days longer!'
The Admiral continued his way down
the steps of the terrace, and crossing the
area passed through the hall and so down
a still loftier flight of steps leading into
Beacon street. Here, two old tars who
were waiting for him, and who always
attended him as body servants when he
went ashore, touched their hats to him
and fell in his wake as he moved down
the middle of the street at a rolling 'fore
the wind gait, not unlike his own ship of
the line when the wind was aft.
`There is no alternative,' mused
General
Howe gravely, as he took a second
look at the moving army in the direction
of Cambridge, `I must retreat on board
the ships ere another week begins.
`Washington seems the last few days to
be in earnest. The opening of Spring
has warmed them out as it does a hive
of bees! The American chief seems,
from yonder long trail of dust to be
moving his centre towards his left wing
or making from it a large detachment!
The head of war sets towards the
southern
quarter of the town! I have no
alternative
but to run away or stay and
capitulate. Well, Jocelyn,' he cried
suddenly to a young man in the uniform
the steps of the terrace with rapid strides.
`What news bring you now! From
your looks you have reconnoitred along
the lines to some purpose!'
`The Americans have commenced
constructing a redoubt on Nook's Hill,
in the peninsula of Dorchester, and are
furnishing it with heavy artillery! This
I learned from a Tory who crossed the
lines as I was reconnoitreing. From
him I got also the important information
that the enemy are about to occupy
Noddle's
Island, and establish batteries there.'
`Then no time is to be lost!' said
Howe, with deep interest in this
information
.
`A battery there will sweep the
surface of the water, stop the passage of
the ships, and reduce us to the necessity
of yielding at discretion! I have been
watching the movements on Nook's Hill
the last half hour and suspected what
they were at.' General Howe then took
his glass and levelled it long and
earnestly
at Noddle's Island which was in
full view from his position.
CHAPTER II.
THE LETTER.
The
decision of the council of war
held on the night of March 15, 1776 in
the east room of the Phillip's mansion,
occupied by General Howe, as his
head-quarters
,
was, as he had predicted in
favor
of immediate evacuation of the town.
Indeed, its occupation for any longer
period would have been madness.
Provisions
were exorbitantly dear and so
very scarce that hundred's both of the
troops and citizens, rebel as well as loyal
were in a state of starvation; sickness
prevailed to an afarming extent both
among the inhabitants and soldiery, the
latter of whom were great sufferers by
their long confinement in such narrow
limits combined with the constant
activity
required of them to prevent a surprise.
Those who went out in boats to catch a
few fish were fired at from the main-land;
vegetables had been for months unknown,
the bakers had no wood to bake their
bread with; and the last batch baked for
General Howe and his staff on the day
our story opened, was from ovens heated
by the wood of the pulpit of the old South
broken up and burned by the soldiers
and citizens. Houses were destroyed for
their wood to kindle fires for cooking and
warmth; counters and petitions of
ware-houses
and even dwelling houses were
demolished for the sake of the wood.
Sixteen months the armed occupation of
the town had lasted, and a crisis had
now been reached, beyond which there
was no advancing without ruin or flight.
The army under Washington was closing
its lines upon the place and the shot from
the American batteries fell in the streets
of the town, and one missile from a
redoubt
at Cambridge buried itself in the
tower of the church in Brattle street,
which was situated in the very heart of
the metropolis. Every moment's delay
was dangerous.
The council of war was fully alive to
the exigency of the situation of the
garrison
,
and it was not requisite that
General
Howe should
smile
or Admiral
Shuldam
swear
(for the Admiral was also
present in council) to produce the result
to which wisdom and prudence directed
them.
`Now,' said General Howe, as the
council broke up, and the officers
composing
it were about to take their leave,
`now that it is the deliberate opinion of
the Council of war that it is expedient
for the safety of the garrison as well as
for the ultimate success of his majesty's
arms in America that the plan be
forthwith
evacuated, it falls upon me to
devise
some means whereby this last resort
may be achieved without disgrace to our
flag and danger to the army! The
Americans now command the town and
are erecting batteries at points that will
in three days have cannon mounted on
Noddle's, and the Islands in the harbor
so as effectually to interdict the passage
of our ships. By the fire of this artillery
they will be able even now to interpose
the greatest obstacles to the embarkation
of our troops. How to obviate this
inconvenience
becomes now a question of
infinite moment. You have decided
that it is best to evacuate the town
tomorrow
.
I will between this and the
morning try and hit upon some scheme
by which the danger of our movement
will be lessened! I trust I shall have
The officers of the council
unanimously
left the further arrangement of the
retreat
to his well known judgment, and
departed to their several quarters to
prepare
in haste and secrecy for the
embarkation
of the ensuing day.
For some time after their departure
General Howe walked up and down the
hall, where he had taken leave of his
officers
,
buried in profound thought. At
no period of his military career had he
been placed in a position so delicate and
trying. Ten thousand men, not to speak
of the honor of the royal arms and his
own reputation as a general, were
depending
on his single mind for safety and
life. It was true he had in the
emergency
called a council of his officers and
divided the responsibility of his task with
them, receiving their unanimous sanction
to the proposed step. But, with all this,
he felt that the whole weight of the duty
and responsibility, of the odium at home,
of the shame with his foes, rested upon
him.
In the open door stood a young man,
a mere youth, in a neat blue naval
undress
,
and a gold laced cap beneath his
arm. The evening wind, as he bared
his temples to the cool air of a
remarkably
warm spring day, blew aside his dark
brown locks, and displayed a forehead
fair, where the tresses were lifted, but
browned otherwheres as if by the
tawning
breezes of the ocean. He was about
nineteen years of age, of a medium
stature
but compactly built, with a carriage
firm and daring. He was, what is to be
sure, of little importance save in young
females, very handsome; but his beauty
was of a manly and courageous
character
,
as if he had been familiar with
dangers
and deeds that carved upon his face
the decision of his active and fearless
spirit.
`Neal,' said General Howe,
addressing
this youth, but without lifting his eyes
towards him or stopping in his walk up
and down the hall.
`Sir William!' he responded, in the
tone and manner of one on the most
intimate
social terms with the British
general
.
`I would have you go forthwith to the
town house and see if the selectmen are
them there of a Sunday evening, general.
These New England folks are great
observers
of the Sabbath. I am more likely
to find them at prayers.' This was
spoken
with a lively air.
`And I warrant you they pray not for
the King either! Go and find them each
and all, wherever they may be, and say
to them that I desire a special interview
with them to-night on matters touching
the present crisis of affairs!'
`I will go, sir! Do you then wish my
services further to-night?'
`Not if you are sleepy?'
`I am not sleepy,' answered the young
man slightly coloring; `but I should like
to have leave to be free from duty 'till
morning.'
`Well, you have it, Neal. But it seems
to me you are a great lover of your leisure
of late! Where do you spend your time?
Not in your quarters; for I have
frequently
sent for you there, after begging leave
of absence, but neither shadow nor
substance
were to be found!'
`Yet when I was really wanted in my
regular service of duty have I not been
easily found and always present?'
`Yes, that is true! But' and
here the English general fixed his eyes
full and searchingly upon the frank face
of the young man who, though a sailor,
acted as his aide-de-camp. He then
turned
away saying, `I will not doubt him!'
`You seem to look upon me strangely,
Sir William?'
`It is nothing!'
`You have heard something against
me!'
`Yes, to tell you the truth, Neal, I
have!'
The youth blushed and bit his lip with
a look of vexation. He dropped his eyes
and seemed embarrassed.
`What have you heard, sir?'
`It is scarcely worth regarding, as it
does you so much injustice. It has come
to my ears from an annonymous source
that I must be on guard against you, for
you were strongly affected towards
rebellion
;
and that if I wished proof of it,
to have you watched when you ask leave
of absence and see where you go, and
how you pass your time!'
If General Howe had been looking full
in the face of the young man while speak
or and a look of confusion that would
have confirmed suspicions of his want of
loyalty.
`If you do not have full confidence in
me, I will return again on board the
frigate
and resume my duties under Admiral
Shuldam!'
`No, no! I trust you. Have I not
shown that I do, by making known to you
what I have heard. Had I doubted your
loyalty, I should have let you departed
whither you desire to go, and sent a spy
to follow you; for the information I
received
would make me to believe that
you have secret intercourse with the
enemy
!'
Neal dropped his glove upon the floor
as it were by accident, though it was done
to conceal, while in the act of stooping
for it, the conscious expression of his
face.
`Who could have given you this
information
,
Sir William?'
`It came to me in writing without
signature
.
I have no doubt it is from some
enemy who would do you an injury! Do
not look so annoyed. You have my
unimpaired
confidence. Haste to fulfil your
mission to the selectmen, and urge them
to come and wait on me without delay!'
General Howe then entered the room
in which he usually received his officers
and transacted business, while the young
man placing his gold-laced chapeau upon
his head, descended the lofty flight of
freestone steps leading to the street, and
took his way rapidly towards the centre
of the town.
General Howe crossed the hall and
rung a small table bell. A youth entered
to whom he said. `Follow Neal unseen!
If he quits the town, return, and let me
know!'
As the British general re-entered his
room, a door at the other side opened and
a lady came in. She was a woman of
noble stature and of a very elegant
appearance
,
with feature pleasing, but too strong
for beauty. She was about thirty seven
or eight years of age, with black hair and
eyes, and an aspect and air, not unlike
that supposed to characterise Lady
Macbeth
.
Her dress was a black satin with
deep lace collar and ruffs, and her hair
without powder. Her face wore a look
of anxiety approaching distress.
`What is this Sir William that I have
overheard touching suspicion of Neal's
loyalty. What know you against my boy?'
`Nothing, Isabel,' answered General
Howe composed, yet kindly, as if he
respected
the feelings of her who addressed
him the inquiries. `You have overheard
all I know!'
`And you do not believe it! For this
my heart is overjoyed! I know he is
true and loyal! It is the work of an
enemy
!
What letter did you receive, and
when did it come to you?'
`Here it is! You see it has no
signature
and it written is a disguised hand,
evidently.'
As General Howe spoke, he took from
a little drawer by the side of his desk, a
folded note and placed it in her hands.
With hurried fingers she opened it and
read with surprise and alarm as follows:
`Near the Camp at Cambridge
;
March, 6.
Sir
:
A commander-in-chief cannot be too
cautious whom he employs about his
person
and makes confidants of his plans and
purposes; especially in the position you
are in, surrounded by enemies whom you
have no means of knowing are other than
they seem. The writer need not apprize
you that the romantic notions of liberty
and independence have seized upon the
minds of more than one youth in the
British army and that they have become
disloyal to their king and taken arms with
the rebels! It will not therefore so much
surprise you to learn the disaffection and
disloyalty of one near your own person
and related to you by ties of
consanquinity
.
I allude to Neal Nelson, against
whom I deem it my duty to put you on
your guard. I recommend to you to
observe
closely his conduct, and watch him
when he absents himself from head
quarters
.
It is easy for a traitor who has the
pass word to go out and in the city at
will. A word to the wise is enough; and
General Howe is known not to be
wanting
in wisdom.'
This is a most extraordinary
communication
,
brother,' said the lady with looks
of surprise and indignation. `It is a plot
to ruin Neal! I do not credit a word of
the base insinuations! I am glad it has
no effect upon you! You did well not
to believe, or take any notice of it!'
`I do not altogether disbelieve it,' an
swered General Howe in a serious
manner
.
`Do you then doubt Neal's loyalty?'
she asked with astonishment.
`I have seen nothing in himthat is
in his conduct that could have raised in
my mind the faintest suspicion of his
integrity
,
if this letter had not come to
hand! But since I have received it I
have thought upon it a good deal, (for
you see it is ingemously worded and well
written, and emanates from no vulgar
source,) and several free sentiments of
his, expressed in conversation from time
to time in the past, have flashed upon my
recollection; which, however, I did not
notice then, for I had no suspicion of his
fealty and attachment to the King,
American-born
as he is! But as I have since
reflected upon these remarks of his, I
have become forcibly impressed with the
belief that this letter ought to have weight;
and since then I have marked Neal
closely
.
`And what have you discovered?'
asked
the lady with deep emotion.
`Nothing new to confirm suspicion;
but you are aware he has the last three
months absented himself from quarters a
good deal, especially at night. This I
should not have taken notice of but for
this letter! Besides we should not
forget
that Boston is his birth-place! This
fact is important in our consideration of
the warning in it!'
`The letter is a false and malicious
tissue of insinuations,' answered the lady
warmly. `But if you suspected Neal why
have you trusted him!'
`That I might watch him closely and
ascertain if he was false!'
`And you have found nothing to
confirm
your suspicions?' she said with a
look of certain triumph.
`Nothing farther than in his request to
be absent again to night, and which
doubtless you overhead, as the rest of
our conversation reached you!
`And why have you told him of your
suspicions? Is this the way to confirm
them? It is strange!'
`I have thought it best, if he is really
inclined to disloyalty to let him know
that I am not wholly ignorant of his
derelection
and to give him an opportunity of
stopping where he is! If I had openly
charged him with being a spy or traitor
and he were really guilty, with his high
proud spirit he would have taken the
first occasion, if I saw fit to leave him at
liberty, to go over to the enemy! I
have told him of the letter to caution
him if he be really guilty, and have
continued
at the same time my confidence
to give him an opportunity of saving his
honor!'
`It
is
possible, but
barely
possible,
Sir William,' said the lady thoughtfully,
`that Neal may have acted imprudently
and perhaps have given ground for this
letter; for I am not ignorant of his
attachment
to his native country. But I
trusted, and still believe that it is an
attachment
to it only in its loyalty not in
its revolt. It is possible he may have
said or done something he should not
have done; but I am sure it has been
through thoughtlessness and not from
intention
!'
`Who do you think the warning letter
came from?'
`I have not the most distant idea!
An enemy of Neal's!'
`I think rather a friend of the King,
who has discovered something in Neal
which his duty has led him to
communicate
to me in this manner!'
`How can it be a friend to the King
when it is dated from Washington's
camp!'
`Examine the date. It is
near
the
camp at Cambridge. The letter is
probably
from a legal tory who resides near
the rebel post; and if I should clearly
express
all my suspicions, sister I should
say that Neal has been seen by him out
of the city!'
`Impossible!'
`It is not unlikely. If my nephew has
been delayed at all, depend upon it he
has seen the inside of the rebel camp!'
`But what motives could have carried
him there?' asked the mother of the
young man who was the subject of the
conversation. `Have you any suspicion
of his being proved a traitor to your
councils?'
`I cannot think that! No! He is too
honorable to act the spy and report what
has transpired here!' said Sir William
Howe warmly.
`Then what has he done? What
reason
has he had for going to the
main-land
?
I am sure that the letter is un
worthy of attention and that some one
who does not like him, taking advantage
of the fact of his being an American has
made this attempt to destroy him!
Perhaps
some one in the garrison itself.'
`It may be so. I shall, however, prove
Neal! It is due to him to give him a
chance of manifesting that he is
innocent
,
and it is due to ourselves that we
know whether we have a traitor within
our walls!'
`God grant he may prove innocent!'
cried his mother with deep emotion. `If
he is a traitor, William, a mother's
bosom shall not shield him from the
punishment
to which you may see fit, as a
military commander, to deliver him up!
But I have faith in his loyalty!'
`I trust he will give proof of it,'
answered
the English General with
sincerity
.
`When he returns will you send him
to me?'
`Oh, whither can my boy desire to go!
God shield him from evil ways!'
`I shall learn whither he has gone?'
said Sir William Howe with an
impressive
manner.
`Have you sent one to observe him?'
she asked tremblingly.
`Yes!'
`Then is my boy saved or lost this
night,' she cried with deep feeling as
hearing steps of men ascending from the
street she left the room.
CHAPTER III.
THE TRUCE.
The
persons whose footsteps were
heard by Lady Isabella Nelson ascending
to the door of the mansion, were two in
number, and dressed, as the hall lamp
showed when they came in front of the
door, in the plain garb of civilians. One
of them was tall, grave and classical
looking, though his occupation was that
of a tradesman; but being a deacon
also, he deemed it proper to assume as
nearly as possible, without infringing too
closely upon the privileges of `the cloth,'
the costume of a man of God. His
countenance was strongly marked and
beamed with shrewdness and benevolence.
He wore a long queus bound with black
silk ribbon and carried a cane with a
gold head to which appended a tassel.
His step was staid and stately as became
a Deacon of the church and a selectman
of the town of Boston.
His companion was a man of less
stature and more abdomen; a smooth,
oily personage in visage, and one who
laughed more than became the gravity
of a dignitary and ruler of the town. He
carried, as was always his custom in fair
weather and foul, a green umbrella which
be used as a staff. His knee buckles
were of silver and shone brightly in
rivalry of his shoe buckles which were of
polished steel, with settings of glass cut
in the representation of diamonds. He
carried visibly in the pocket of his brown
cloth coat, a blue spotted silk
handkerchief
and held in his hand a tortoise
shell snuff-box, out of which he every two
minutes and a half, charged his nose with
rappee, each of which charges was duly
followed by a sneezing explosion.
`Ah, gentlemen, I am happy to see
you,' said the English General,
advancing
into the ball to receive his expected
guests! `You are prompt in complying
with my wishes.'
Thus speaking the accomplished
English-commander
extended his hand to
each.
`We are always happy to wait upon
your excellency,' said the portly,
dignitary
bowing with suavity. `Will your
excellency accept a pinch of rappee.'
And the open box after being tapped by
a peculiar movement of the fore finger,
known only to the initiated, was
extended
towards the English officer.
`Thank you, Mr. Buzzel, I do not
indulge
!
Walk in gentlemen! Your
friends and coadjutors I expect
momently
!
Be seated Deacon Farrington.'
`You seem to be quite at your ease,
Sir William,' responded Deacon
Farrington
,
after looking at the composed
countenance of the British chief! `I
suppose you know that General
Washington
is drawing his lines every day
closer about the town.'
`Yes, I am quite well aware of it,'
answered
Sir William Howe quietly. `You
prefer Burgundy I believe, Mr. Buzzel!'
he added, placing a decanter before this
gentleman.
`Yes, Burgundy is my favorite, Sir
William!'
Deacon! Gentlemen help yourselves!.
In a few moments your friends will be
here and then we will proceed to
business
.'
The two guests each helped himself
to his favorite wine, (for temperance
was not then a law of the land; and
`where there is no law there is no sin')
and the English General gave as a
sentiment
.
`An amicable termination to the
disagreement
between the mother country
and her colonies!'
`I will drink the toast, Sir William,'
said Mr. Buzzel, pointedly; `but with
the explanation that by amicable I am to
understand honorable to us!'
`With the acknowledgment of our
independence
I trust also,' said Deacon
Farrington very positively.
`As you please gentlemen! I but
place a mirror before you, in my toast,
and I expect each man when he looks
into it will see his own face and not my
own!'
`That is very fairly said, Sir William,'
remarked Mr. Buzzel.
`Very,' echoed the Deacon formally.
The glasses were emptied and General Howe entered into conversation with the
two rulers of the town, in which he
insiduously
forced the way for his
purposes
.
At length the remainder of the
selectmen arrived, and then closing his
door, the English General opened to
them as follows the object of the
interview
he sought of them:
`You are aware, gentlemen,' he said,
addressing himself particularly to Mr.
Greene the chief of the Board, a man of
intelligence and wisdom, `you are aware
that a crisis in the state of the garrison
occupying your town has been reached.
I need not inform you of what you
already
know, that Boston is no longer a
safe position for the British troops.
Washington
is acquainted with the distresses
that prevail here among us, and is now
active in taking advantage of them. In
a word, gentlemen, it must be as clear to
your minds as to my own, that I can no
longer hold the post in safety or with
honor.'
`We are quite as well convinced of
your inability, Sir William Howe, as you
seem to be yourself, to maintain the town
dignity; `I therefore trust that you are
prepared to capitulate upon terms'
`Capitulate, sirs!' repeated the British
general haughtily! `The word I am
ignorant
of while I command in his
majesty's
name!'
`Then for what purpose have you
called
us together by a special and urgent
message?'
`You shall learn, gentlemen, that is
not to sue to you or throw myself upon
your mercy!' he answered haughtily.
`This high language, Sir William
Howe, is well enough to cover your
weakness
but it cannot deceive us,' answered
Mr. Greene with decision. `We are
fully
informed, and through us, General
Washington is, also, of your actual
position
.
We know that you have not seven
thousand troops out of a nominal force of
ten thousand, fit for service. We know
that a thousand of your people are lying
ill in your military hospitals, and that
those who are well are weak and
discontented
from the privations in food and
warmth to which they have been
subjected
.
We know that disaffection and
bitterness
pervades your garrison, and that
only a spark is needed to kindle a flame
of revolt throughout the length and
breadth of your barracks. We know that
the American Commander in Chief,
aware of your situation, proposes to bring
the siege to a close by a decisive blow.
The truth of this you have evidence of,
in the redoubts that are being nightly
thrown up on every side of you and
almost
within gun-shot of your own sentries
and out-posts! We know that you have
not provisions to sustain your men
twenty
days longer, and that you look for no
reinforcements; for we are not ignorant
that you have of late been bitter in your
invectives against the ministry for
neglecting
you and forgetting you as you
have termed their silence. Knowing all
this we are prepared to hear from you
proposals for terms that we may transmit
them to General Washington in your
behalf
!'
Sir William Howe listened with
surprise
and an angry frown to this bold
address from one of the rebel rulers of
the town, whom in his pleasure he had
permitted to hold office and power. But
he could not but feel the full force of his
the Selectmen had represented them.
But the more critical his situation was
the more needful it was for him to put a
bold front upon it.
`If you think I am to be a suppliant
to you, Mr. Selectman, you are in great
error,' he said firmly. `I am as fully
advised
of my position as you can be. To
sue to you, or through you to
Washington
,
was not my object in sending for
you here to-night. I know not only the
difficulties that environ me, but I have
confidence as well in my ability to cope
with them. A British general with eight
thousand regular troops under his
command
has victory in his hand whenever
he chooses to go to battle. We do not
count Washington's twenty thousand
rabble
as a force at which to be intimidated.'
`Then why have you not taken
possession
of the Heights of Dorchester, Sir
William?' asked Mr. Buzzel, who had
been trying for some time to get a word
in.
`Because, sir, it is no object for me to
hold them. Neither, gentlemen,' he
continued, addressing them all in a bold
manner, `neither is it an object for the
crown longer to hold Boston! It is of
no further use to his Majesty! In a
word I would let you see the policy of
the ministry at which you accuse me of
murmuring. My instructions were to
huld Boston until I had concentrated the
body of the American forces in the
neighborhood and drawn upon this
single
point the attention and armed power
of the whole country. When I had done
so my intentions were to withdraw on
board the fleet which for this purpose I
have, as you have seen, detained in port,
and embark for some other point of your
shores unguarded and there take
possession
,
and from it as a centre subdue
the adjacent region. Having, therefore,
fulfilled my instructions, I have sent for
you to inform you that it is my
intention
tomorrow or the next day to
evacuate
the town and retire on board the
shipping. It is possible to maintain the
town, and I would maintain it at all odds
were the advantages commensurate with
the trouble. But the experience of the
last few months has shown me that the
port of Boston is far from being
conveniently
situated to accommodate the fu
pected soon to arrive from England. A
desire to concentrate at this point all the
American forces has hitherto prevented
me from withdrawing from the town.
This motive of delay no longer exists,
for in whatever direction I level my
spy-glass
around the peninsula I behold the
armies of the rebels gathering and
settling
themselves like flights of locusts.'
When the British General had ended
this subtle address, the selectmen looked
at one another with blank faces.
Surprise
was manifest on each countenance.
Even Mr. Greene appeared amazed at
the high position taken by the general
who seemed already in their power; he
was, as well as his colleagues, confounded
by the new arguments he had advanced.
Mr. Buzzel took snuff very rapidly, and
looked from one to another as if
uncertain
how to take the affair, until he had
guessed at the sentiments of the rest.
`You have given us, Sir William, a
fair display of that diplomacy for which
you are said to be famed,' said Mr.
Greene. `It may be true that you have
had instructions such as you mention.
I do not wish to question the veracity of
any gentleman though he be my country's
foe and invader. But whether or no your
experience has proved to you that Boston
Port is not perfectly accommodated to the
future
operations of the army, yet it needs
no proof that you are in no condition to
remain in possession of the place should
to-night arrive from Lord Dartmouth
instructions
ordering you to hold it, to use
your own expression, `at all odds!' Let us
perfectly understand each other, Sir
William
!
Your words have not changed
my mind from the first conviction which
it received when your young aid-de-camp,
Mr. Nelson, brought me your request to
see me in my official capacity!'
`And pray, sir, what was this
conviction
?'
asked the English general
appearing
slightly confused.
`That you saw the strait in which your
garrison was placed, and desired to
arrange
terms of capitulation for the safety
of all. For you are well aware that our
cannon already commands, or will do so
before you could embark, the passage of
the harbor, and that it is impossible for
you to escape without the consent of your
enemies!'
deeply at this assertion. He well knew
the fact. He was perfectly aware that in
twenty-four hours more the Americans
would interdict the passage to sea; and
that he could, in less time, scarcely hope
with the greatest haste of departure, to
embark his numerous forces. For a few
moments he remained silent. He saw
that it was useless to attempt longer to
trifle with the body of men he had called
before him, or to endeavor to make them
believe, to save the credit of the royal
arms, that he was voluntarily leaving the
town. He, therefore, resolved to enter
at once upon the matter in a frank,
business
manner.
`Whatever be the immediate causes of
the act, gentlemen, is not material to our
purpose,' he said in a grave manner; `let
it suffice for you to know that I have
resolved
to abandon the town of Boston and
retire on board the fleet. It is my
intention
to withdraw
peaceably
, if your
countrymen
are disposed, on their part, to act
in the same manner. I have sent for you
to make known to you this my purpose,
that you may wait upon General
Washington
and report to him what I say to
you and to him through you.'
`You are no doubt willing enough to
retire unmolested, sir,' said Mr.
Farrington
standing up and stretching his tall,
gaunt form to its loftiest dimensions;
`but it is a question whether our
outraged
and indignant country will be so
willing
as to let you retire in this manner.
You have no choice! Retire you must!
Your situation admits neither of
hesitation
or delay! Therefore you cannot
say, you will not withdraw if we will not
give our promise to let you go quietly,
you with your goods, your arms, your
camp, furniture and your spoils; for you
must go, whatever we do, or remain and
give yourselves up prisoners of war!'
`Sir,' said Mr. Buzzel, looking very
red in the cheeks and rapping his
snuff-box
cover with an emphasis that made a
report like that of a pocket pistol, `Sir,
do you suppose, sir, that, Sir William,
sir, that we are agoing to let you go in
peace with your wives and little ones,
flocks and herds, gods and goddesses, as
my friend the Deacon just re'
`I said nothing about gods and
goddesses
,
squire,' interrupted the Deacon
`True, deacon, but its no matter, sir!
I
did! Do you think, Sir William, sir,
that we who have been sixteen months
shut up here, starving, freezing, dying
with the plague for want of food and fire
wood, and innumerable other evils too
numerous to enumeratedo you suppose
sir! No sir! I would buckle on my
sword, sir, first sir, and stand at the head
of Long Wharf, sir, with it drawn in my
hand sir, and would singly stay your
departure
,
if I had to lay down the last drop
of blood I had in my body, sir! Yes sir!'
Here Mr. Buzzel took a huge pinch
of snuff, and drank a glass of Sir
William's
Burgundy, it being the eighth
bumper
he had taken, which will account for
his very extraordinary speech; for
between
snuff, wine and patriotism, Mr.
Buzzel was very tipsy.
`Mr. Buzzel,' said deacon Farrington,
laying his large hand upon the little
man's shoulder, `you have this day
brought discredit upon the good name of
the rulers of the town. You have drank
wine beyond sobriety. Be silent sir, for
when the wine is in the wit is out!'
`I cannot see, General Howe, on what
grounds you can ask leave of us, to be
suffered to retire in peace,' said Mr.
Greene. `You have brought by your
presence a blight upon the land, and
vengeance
and justice cry for retribution!'
`On the ground of your own interest
and safety! Although compelled to
retire
,
I am not impotent! I have caused
to be prepared, several tons of
combustible
materials to set fire to the dwellings
of the city, should the provincials molest
me in my departure in any shape. One
word from me and your fair town would
be laid in ashes! Further, I invite you,
gentlemen, to reflect upon the dangers
which must inevitably result, for you and
your habitations and those of the
numerous
families friendly to your side of the
quarrel now in the city of a battle should
be fought between the garrison and the
American forces under Washington, in
your streets. For the distress and
misery
of such a deplorable event, fall upon
your own heads, not on mine. I have
offered to retire peaceably. I will do so
if I am unmolested. But if in case I
commense embarking my troops, they
are molested, I will fire and sack the city
ere I leave it!'
`Such a proceedure would recoil on
yourselves,' said Mr. Greene firmly.
`Not a transport would ever quit the
harbornot a British soldier would
escape alive.'
`That may be. But is not
forbearance
with your city whole and your
citizens secure better than these
alternatives
to either of us. If, therefore,
you have the interest of your town and
the happiness of your fellow-citizens at
heart, I would exhort you to see General
Washington early in the morning.
Repeat
to him what you have heard from
me, and say to him that I demand the
following conditions; that I have fifty
hours to embark my troops in from the
time he grants the terms of truce: that
I depart with all the munitions of war in
my possession: that I shall be permitted
to take with me as many of the loyalist
families with their effects as desire to
abandon the country; and that those
which remain shall have their personal
liberty secured to them; that I shall be
permitted to remain anchored in the
harbor
until the wind, now unfavorable,
shall permit the fleet to depart!'
`We will wait upon General
Washington
,
sir,' said Mr. Greene, after he
and his colleagues had conversed apart
for a little while; `but I do not think he
will consent to all the conditions you
demand!'
`General Washington is a wise man
and will not let a temporary advantage
present the accomplishment of so
desirable
a result on my departure from Boston.'
The selectmen waited upon the
American
commander-in-chief on the ensuing
morning. They laid before him the
propositions of Sir William Howe. At
first he rejected them; but finally on
their making a very affecting
representation
of the situation of the city he
consented
to all the conditions demanded
save the removal of the munitions. The
English General yielded this exception
and prepared gladly to withdraw from a
position which he could no longer hold
in safety.
CHAPTER IV.
THE EVACUATION OF THE TOWN.
On
the seventeenth of March sixteen
hours after the ratification of the truce
required by Sir William Howe, the
British
troops were in motion preparatory to
embarkation. So early as four o'clock,
long before the first light of dawn began
to show itself in the East, the garrison
marched out of barracks and formed
along Cornhill, Beacon street and upon
the Common. The morning broke upon
eight thousand wearied and worn troops,
suffering by cold, scanty clothing and
hunger, drawn up in lines, each man
burdened
with what he could carry upon his
back. The morning was chilly and
foggy
and contributed to the dispirited air
of the men who felt that their condition
was likely to be but little improved by
being crowded on board transports and
subjected to the dangers of the
inhospitable
seas of that region and the horrors
of sea-sickness. Not a company when
its roll was called was found complete.
Numbers preferring to be taken
prisoners
by the Americans or desiring to join
their standard had secreted themselves in
the barracks and houses under cover of
the darkness.
At five o'clock the order for the line
to form in column and march was
communicated
;
and without colors
displayed
and merely with the tap of a drum
commenced its melancholy retreat
through Cornhill and State street and in
the direction of Long Wharf Here
they were embarked as fast as the boats
from the one hundred and fifty transports
could be filled with men and rowed off
to the ships to return and take fresh
numbers.
The American citizens of the town
remained quiet spectators of the retreat
of their invaders; being ordered by
General
Howe to keep in their houses.
They crowded the roofs and balconies to
observe their march through the town to
the water-side; but not a shout or cry of
derision was raised. They gazed in the
same silence with which the troops
moved
by.
There were in the town fifteen
hundred
loyalists or Tories, who, many of
them were wealthy citizens and had been
born in Boston. They now began to
feel the effects of their blind attachment
to the royal side. Compelled with
infinite
dejection and tears of regret to
abandon
residences so long dear to them,
they had been engaged since the evening
before, when the order was issued from
head quarters to prepare for evacuating
the city in twelve hours, in packing up
their personal property and securing their
valuables. When the morning dawned
hundreds of these families were seen
hurrying
from their homes where they had
long dwelt in luxury and enjoyed years of
felicity, and seeking an asylum on board
the ships. There was no distinction of
suffering. The rich, who had the most
valuables to remove suffered more than
others; for the poor man could carry all
his load upon his shoulders and upon the
backs of his wife and children; but the
rich, weary with much goods, were
dependant
upon carts and wagons to
remove
to the wharf what he would carry
away. But such was the scene of
confusion
and distress, and so great was the
demand for wagons, that all could not be
supplied; and some of the fathers of
families
,
once among the most influential in
the Commonwealth were now bending
under burdens which they could get no
man to carry. Mothers, young and
delicately
reared carried their children and
took their way weeping towards the
decks; `the last salutations,' says the
eloquent
historian Botta, `the farewell
embraces of those who departed and of
those who remained, the sick, the
wounded
,
the aged the infants, would have
moved with compassion the witnesses of
their distress, if the care of his own
safety
had not absorbed the attention of each
one.
The carts and beasts of burden
became
the occasion of sharp disputes;
and in various parts of the town fierce
battles took place between the soldiers
who would seize upon them and the tory
inhabitants who would maintain them.
Even the march of the main column was
more than once obstructed by fearful
contests between the loyalists themselves
for the possession of horses and wagons
with which to convey their effects to the
shipping. Added to this was each one's
fear lest he should be left behind to fall
into the hands of the enemy, and a
desire
to secure first a berth on board the
transports. Whither the fleet which
received
them was destined no one knew
and the uncertainty was an additional
cause of anxiety and distress to the more
intelligent portion of the flying loyalists.
Meanwhile a desperate band of
English
soldiers and sailors who had fallen
into the rear of the embarking army took
advantage of the confusion to force doors
and pillage the houses and shops of
whatever
the loyalists could not remove; and
even attempted the dwellings of the
provincials
who, however, met them with
such firmness that they were under the
necessity of confining their lawless
depredations
exclusively to the deserted
abodes of the tories, in which they
found a great deal that was valuable that
had been deserted by the owners lest
delay
should lose them a chance of getting
a berth in the ships. These desperadoes
destroyed what they could not carry
away. The city before this presented
an appearance melancholy enough but
now it had an aspect of devastation that
it was painful to contemplate. Thrice
they fired the houses they had pillaged,
but by the prompt energy of the citizens
the flames were extinguished and the
town saved from conflagration.
By ten o'clock in the forenoon the
whole garrison was embarked on board
the shipping, and in the very face of the
American batteries which completely
commanded the embarkation. But the
latter only remained distant and quiet
spectators of the scene. The vessels,
many of which were small, overladen with
men and baggage, and the fruits of the
indiscriminate pillage, as well as with
the effects of the unhappy loyalists.
Provisions
were very scanty, not enough
being
on board at first for the full
allowance
of the crews and soldiers; and the
loyalists had brought only plate and
other
articles which at that crisis were of
less value than bread. Confusion
reigned
throughout the fleet. Every deck of
the one hundred and fifty three
transports
was a scene of discord unparalleled.
Women weeping, infants screaming, men
moaning and lamenting the loss of
property
left behind, soldiers cursing and
drinking and the seamen unable to do
any thing in the crowd and uproar,
swearing
at all.
Scarcely had the last crowded boat
load of soldiers left the end of Long wharf
when the roar of cannons from the
American
lines south of the town announced
that Washington had commenced the
march of his army to take possession of
the deserted town! The report of the
artillery was responded to by the citizens
with loud shouts of gratitude and joy.
They now poured from their houses into
the streets and hastened towards the Neck
to receive the Deliverer.
General Howe! who was tee last man
to embark had hardly placed his foot in
the boat that was to take him to the
shipping
when Washington entered the town
on the other side with colors displayed,
drums beating `Yankee Doodle,' and all
the forms of victory and triumph.
Mounted upon a snow white charger,
and attended by his generals aids, among
whom rode Neal Nelson, the chief
triumphantly
entered the principal street of
the city, and at every step of his advance
was hailed by the citizens so long
forcibly
held prisoners to the garrison, as a
deliverer and conquerer.
`Their joy,' says the historian, `broke
forth with the more vivacity as their
sufferings
had been long and cruel. For
more than sixteen months they had
endured
hunger, thirst, cold, and the insults
of an insolent soldiery who deemed them
rebels; and suffering in common with
the garrison, the horrors of famine they
had been reduced even to subsist on the
flesh of horses!
The victorious besieging army,
numbering
sixteen thousand organized troops,
passed into town battalion after
battalion
,
and after passing through the whole
length of Cornhill, marched to the
common
and then formed.
On riding over the town, and
receiving
the reports of the selectmen and
citizens
of the sufferings of the inhabitants,
which were apparent in their hollow
cheeks and emaciated forms,
Washington
was seen to be so deeply moved as to
shed tears. He found that the English
had left a great quantity of artillery
and munitions, but among them little or
no powder, of which the army was nearly
destitute.
`Thus after a siege of long duration
the capital of the Province of
Massachusetts
fell again into the hands of the
Americans. The joy this happy event
produced was universal throughout all
true hearts in the land. It gave a new
impulse to the public spirit, and inspired
with enthusiasm the hitherto desponding.
Contrary winds, succeeded by a dead
calm prevented the English fleet from
getting to sea until the eighth day after
the troops were taken on board; a
period
of intense suffering and privation to
all on board. At length the wind
became
favorable and the fleet sailed. Its
destination was at the time unknown.
The general opinion was that it was
destined
for Charleston or New York; but
it actually sailed for Halifax, where it
arrived after a remarkably short passage.
For the subsequent movements of
General
Howe the reader is referred to the
histories of the period.
As the evacuation of Boston could not
be known to English vessels then at sea,
or to others just about sailing from
Europe
for the port of Boston, Admiral
Shuldam had left in the waters of Boston
bay a small squadron under the command
of Commodore Banks to protect the
navigation
of the vessels of the king, which,
in ignorance of the evacuation of the
city might continue their voyage towards
it. `This precaution, however, had not
all the effect,' says Botta, `that was
desired
;
the bay being extensive, the
American cruisers lay in concealment
behind the numerous little islands with
which it is interspersed, and sprang
suddenly upon the ships that
presented
themselves without mistrust. It
is at this crisis, and amid these islands
that our story will be resumed when we
shall have followed our hero Neal Nelson,
after his departure from the presence of
his uncle Sir William Howe on his
mission
to the Selectmen. But we will first
explain why a sailor, as he was, should
have been made an aid of the military
Commander-in Chief.
Isabella Howe, the General's sister,
had early married a young lieutenant
without any other qualifications than his
sword, a handsome person, great courage
and an honorable fame. This marriage
was kept secret for some time, as she
knew that her family would refuse its
sanction. It was however discovered,
and to escape persecution, Lieutenant
Nelson fled with his wife to Boston. On
the birth of her only child, Neal, she
wrote and made it known to her brothers,
who, however, were so exasperated that
they succeeded, by their influence, in
getting her husband removed to the East
India station in a time of great mortality,
where he fell a victim to the climate.
Subsequently, Sir William regretted the
act, and as an atonement, sent for his
sister
and got a midshipman's berth in the
service for his nephew. Neal was seven
years old when he left Boston for England
with his mother. At eleven he entered
the navy under his uncle, lord Admiral
Howe. When he reached his nineteenth
year he accompanied General Sir Wiliam
Howe to Boston in Admiral Shuldam's
frigate, to which he was attached.
When General Howe took up his quarters
on shore he invited Neal to take up his
abode with him. While he was here, his
mother, who had not seen her son for
several years, came over to visit him and
became an inmate of Sir William's abode.
Neal was daily in the presence of his
uncle
,
and in his full confidence. In his
character he was frank and manly, and
every feeling of rectitude and honor
inspired
his conduct. His very face invited
confidence; and no one who knew him
could believe that he would be guilty of
any act of dishonor. His mother, whom
he tenderly loved, was proud of the high
tone of his feelings, and anticipated for
him the most brilliant career. Sir
William
regarded him with affection and
relied
implicitly upon his loyalty and good
faith.
Neal was all that his mother or his
uncle
believed him to be. He was
honorable
,
noble in mind, truthful and sincere
in character. But all this was
consistent
with sympathy for the wrongs of the
land which gave him birth! From the
time he stepped foot on shore at Boston
six months previous to its evacuation, he
could not forget that he was born there
that he was an American. He
remembered
,
as he roamed about the town, the
Common, Beacon and Copp's Hill, all
the places which in his early boyhood he
had frequented. His spirit from every
scene drank in that love of country which
is so strong in the American boy.
By degree his mind, naturally active
and intelligent, began to examine the
cause of the quarrel between the land of
his birth and the mother country. He
found among the provincials who were
detained in the town, an old man, who
related to him the whole history of
grievances
!
who unfolded to him the tyranny
and oppression of England, the
forbearance
and suffering of the Colonies in
their true light. His heart was fired by
the recital and his sympathies gradually
became enlisted with those who were so
bravely battling for independence. Yet
he by no means thought of joining his
countrymen. The idea of quitting the
service of the king never for a moment
entered his mind. He felt for and
sympathized
with the Americans, but he
dreamed not of disloyalty. He could
admire
the spirit of the patriots without
feeling any desire to descrt the service
of the king.
But the seeds of liberty once sowo in
the heart will first take root downward
and then spring its stalk upward into open
view. Neal's was a mind well fitted for
the promotion of the up-springing of such
a plant. The subject was ever upon his
minc. The character of Washington
commanded his admiration and respect
The patience and perseverence and
endurance
of the American soldiery
astonished
him. Daily he thought upon their
cause, until, at length, he found himself
in the presence of his uncle, speaking
warmly in praise of the American
General
,
and wishing that the King and
ministry
would do justice to the Colonies.
`And do you think think they are
doing
injustice, Neal?' asked Sir William
Howe, surprised.
`Yes, sir!' answered the young man
firmly. `I have examined the whole
ground of quarrel, and I feel satisfied that
England is in the wrong. I am
persuaded
,
also, that if the ministry would look
to it impartially they would see that they
cannot be sustained in equity in the
coercive
course they have taken!'
`You had best go home in a frigate,
nephew, and teach the ministry,' said Sir
William Howe laughing. `If you will
undertake the mission, I will despatch a
ship with you to-morrow.'
Neal's cheek burned, and he felt a
little
vexed and mortified; but the recption
his opinion had met with, did not
diminish
his awakening patriotism. The
sneering
manner in which his uncle had
replied
to him stung and angered him. A
few days afterwards he was led a second
time to speak, with unguarded zeal, of
the spirit and bravery which a party of
Americans had exhibited in a certain
encounter
with a detachment of the British
on a foraging expedition, and Sir
William
Howe could not but see, from his
eye and tone, as well as from his words,
that his sympathies went strongly with
the American party, and that he felt glad
at the defeat of the British; for the latter
had been discomfited and driven within
their lines with the loss of many men
killed
and taken prisoners.
`You had best join the rebels at once,
Neal!' answered his uncle, fixing upon
the young seaman a keen look.
`I have no wish to join them, sir,' he
answered firmly; `but I still feel
persuaded
that they are fighting in a cause that
will be ultimately successful. Such men
can never be conquered.'
`We shall at least try to conquer them,
nephew,' said the English General in a
tone of derision. `If you have such
sentiments
as these, you had best dismiss
them at once from your mind, or not give
them utterance!'
`I do not fear to speak as I think,'
answered
Nesl firmly.
`It is not always safe to do so, young
man. Your language has treason in it,
and if spoken before such men as
Shuldam
or Gage, would lose you your
liberty
.
But I am aware of the warmth of
your feelings, and know you are more
thoughtless than traitorous. So let me
hear no more of this!' This
conversation
took place about three weeks
preceding
the evacuation of the place.
Neal obeyed his uncle. From that
day he was careful to conceal from him
his thoughts; not, however, because he
had been commanded to do so, but
because
a change had taken place in his
character and feelings that rendered
precaution
necessary for his safety; for he
had, in the interval, fully committed
himself
,
though secretly, in the rebel cause;
and so far as to lead him to resolve when
an opportunity should offer, to withdraw
from the town, and attach himself to the
provincial party.
How this change and determination
was brought about, and the instrument
that achieved it, will be explained in the
next chapter.
CHAPTER V.
THE HEROINE.
The
severity with which Sir William
Howe reprimanded his youthful relative
for his free expression of his opinion,
accompanied
as the reproof was with
ridicule
,
vexed Neal not a little. His pride
was touched by the contempt with which
his bold avowal of his sentiments had
been received. He was at that age, and
of that frank, ingenious temper which
knows no double dealing, and which
fearlessly
manifests its emotions. Neal saw
nothing to occasion surprise, that,
because
he thought the Americans were
right in resistance, he should say so.
He had not lived so long in the world as
to learn that the truth must sometimes be
withheld; and that men must speak as
interest and prejudice dictate. Though
serving England he did not feel himself
the less competent to see the difference
between right and wrong! nor, seeing
it, did he suspect that he was doing
anything
reproachable in making known his
sentiments.
He was therefore not a little annoyed
by the manner in which his uncle had
received his opinions. For this uncle,
he had not of late felt very ardent
attachment
.
He had, not many days before,
learned from his mother for the first time,
the history of her marriage, of her
persecution
,
of her father's wicked death, and
the relentless conduct of his uncle
towards
him and her. He had, when she
discovered his honest indignation,
pledged
himself to his mother not to show any
ill-will towards Sir William Howe, but to
manifest the same respect as formerly
towards
him. The promise was easier
than its execution. Neal could not from
that day but feel that he was in the
presence
of a man who had proved the
greatest
enemy to his parents. This feeling
of resentment went far to sever his
attachment
both to his uncle and to the
royal cause. He felt that he no longer
owed to his uncle duty or service.
The manner in which his free
expression
of opinion was received a few days
after his mother's communication, did
not by any means serve to increase his
regard for his distinguished relative.
A few moments afterwards he left the
room to retire ostensibly to his quarters,
which were a few doors farther east on
the same street. Instead of entering the
dwelling where his room was, he passed
by it and took his way rapidly down
School street and across Cornhill in the
direction of Fort Hill. It was seven
o'clock in the evening and the air was
filled with snow, for it was the last of
January, about six weeks previous to the
evacuation of the town. Here and there
at the corners of the streets, or in passing
guard houses he was challenged by the
sentries, who enveloped in their thick
winter coats, paced up and down at a
quick tread on their posts, and looking,
by the light of the lamps swung above
the sentry-box, like shaggy Greenland
bears.
As he passed the old South which was
occupied as a barracks for a corps of
cavalry, he saw an officer just
dismounting
at the West door, who throwing his
bridle to a sergeant crossed the walk as
he went by so as to intercept him. Neal
was enveloped in a storm jacket such as
naval officers stand watch in, in heavy
weather, and perhaps was recognized by
it, rather than by his features, which
were nearly concealed within the meeting
collar.
`Ah, Nelson, is it you?'
`Yes, Colonel Jocelyn. How do you
do to-night?'
`Cleverly, thank you! But whither
away such a blustering night? Come in
and take something to warm yourself.
I have been out the last two hours
towards
the Roxbury lines watching the
movements of a party of infernal rebels
who have been skulking since sun-down
about the neck as if bent on mischief.
We sent a few shot at them but they took
no more notice of the balls than as if they
had been wooden bowles and themselves
so many nine-pins! I received orders
to be ready to make a cavalry charge
upon
them if they came nearer, but they
have at length retired, and so I am at
liberty to go to sleep, a luxury I haven't
enjoyed this thirty-six hours, save in the
saddle!'
`Where are your men?' asked Neal
carelessly.
`They came up in advance of me
quarter of an hour ago, and I dare say
sound asleep in the galleries of this
puritan
conventiele, every soul of them. But
come in! I have a bed and a bumper
for you.'
`Thank you; I have an engagement!'
answered Neal.
`With a pretty rebel, I dare swear!'
responded Jocelyn, laughing. `Do you
know I have heard of your being a very
frequent guest with that old rebel,
Colonel
Parks! They say he has a pretty
neice; but I have not had the pleasure
of seeing her yet; for she secludes
herself
like a nun.'
Neal colored in spite of an effort to
command the expression of his face, and
said in a gay tone,
`Rebel Colonels may have fair neices
enow in Boston, and the gallant Colonel
Jocelyn be far more wise upon the
matter
than I.'
With this reply he passed on, bidding
the huzzar officer good night. He
turned
into Milk street and so on to what is
now known as Pearl street. He
ascended
it about half way and then stopped in
front of a stately mansion, three stories
in height facing the West, and separated
from the street by a terrace garden.
After looking carefully about him to
see if he was observed, he entered the
gate, and ascending to the front door
knocked for admittance After a little
delay the door was opened by an old
man, erect and stately in his figure, and
with an air at once venerable and
military
.
When he recognised his visitor he
smiled and extended his hand with
cordial
and affectionate welcome.
`Come in, my son! The storm is
most too violent for you to be abroad.'
`I am a seaman, sir, and little regard
the weather,' answered Neal as he
entered
.
`Come in and let me hear what news
you have! We live so retired we get
nothing certain, though strange accounts
are continually coming to us through our
domestics. Never mind stopping to
knock off the snow out side. Hang your
coat in the hall as it is. We New
Englanders
are not afraid to have snow
brought into our houses.'
Neal removed his rough coat which
was fairly whitened with the flakes and
followed the old gentleman into a small
comfortable parlor warmed by a blazing
wood fire. The whole apartment wore
an air of quiet, grave respectability,
without
osteatation or luxury. An old
fashioned
calico sofa and two arm chairs, the
backs embroidered with heraldic designs,
invited to comfortable repose. Over the
mantle piece was a portrait of Queen
Anne, and around the walls hung pictures
of battles in Flanders, set in carved
frames of great antiquity. The andirons
were brass dogs and shone like the sun;
while the brass latches and locks of the
doors rivalled them in lustre. A pipe
upon the mantle showed that the host
loved to smoke; and a book case of
three or four hundred volumes, partly
hid by a green curtain, betrayed his love
for literature.
On one side of the fire-place stood a
small work-table, on which lay a piece of
needle-work in a state of progress, and
the needle sticking in it, the low rocking
chair still in motion; a ladies
handkerchief
lying on the floor betrayed that the
embroiderer had but the instant before
deserted it, probably on hearing the rap
at the door.
Neal looked at the little work table
and chair as he entered with the
animated
look of one about to address some
one whom he expected to find occupying
it; but the instant change that passed
across his face showed his
disappointment
.
`Anne will return in a moment, Neal.
She did not know it was you or she
would not have run.'
But her father was mistaken. It was
because she knew it was Neal that she
did fly! She flew to change her dress,
for not expecting any visiter so stormy a
night she was in a sort of home undress;
which though sweetly becoming, and
displaying her exquisite shape to the most
conceivable advantage, she did not think
it proper to appear in before a young
gentleman; for Anne Parks, though
possessed of excellent taste had not yet
learned that our sex are most charmed
with simplicity of costume in hers.
`What is this rumor, my young friend,
that Sir William Howe proposes to march
out with the whole garrison to-morrow,
and give General Washington battle?'
asked Colonel Parks, after Neal had
seated himself in the opposite arm chair
to his own, leaving the low cushioned
rocking-chair to be occupied by her for
whose return his throbbing heart and
listening ears were waiting.
`There is no foundation for the rumor
ripe as it is.'
`Yes, there is no question but that
such a report has been circulated by
General Howe.'
`Yes; his motive in doing it, I can
now say to you, sir, without betraying
his confidence in me, was to draw
Washington's
forces all to one focus at
Roxbury
;
when taking advantage of the open
country he meant to land a large
detachment
at Lechmere Point to forage for
provisions! But as the American
General
with his characteristic penetration has
seen through the ruse and kept his army
quiet, the plan has failed.'
`I guessed this was his motive. Howe
is in no situation to fight a battle. He
is growing each day weaker, and in six
month's time unless he is reinforced from
England he will have to capitulate or
withdraw on board the shipping!'
`One of these results is inevitable.
But my sympathies are no longer with
him or the royal cause!'
`Indeed! are you then becoming one
of us?' asked the old man with
sparkling
eyes. `I have been looking for
this! I have hoped for it! I have
refrained
from advising or urging you to be
with us. I have satisfied myself with
explaining
to you all the causes of our
differences
with England and the motive
which led us to take up arms, leaving
the inferences to your own good sense
and justice. I have understood fully
your position as nephew and aid of the
General in chief, and I have forborne to
influence you though I felt that time
would produce a change and lead you to
right decision and action!'
`Yes decision and action is what I
have been deficient in, sir. But I fear
you place more meaning upon my words
than I meant to give them? I meant to
say that I am satisfied that the king is
wrong and the Provincials right! that
the latter have my hearty wishes for their
ultimate independence of the crown!'
`I did then give too much meaning to
your words my young friend,' said the
venerable Patriot with a look of
disappointment
.
`I can condemn the course of
England
,
and yet remain in her service!'
`True, true! There are others in
your army that do not approve of the
war against us, yet are prepared to
slaughter us?'
`They cannot resign without ruining
themselves or doubtless they would do
so!'
`Is there no other course for them to
take? Is nothing else suggested to
their minds? Must they remain in the
service or sink into beggary? Shall I
speak more plainly? are there not two
sides to this quarrel? are there not two
armies? If one is engaged in a wrong
cause is not the other in a right one?'
Neal listened with surprise. He had
never conceived that the legitimate
fruit of his growing dissatisfaction ought
to be the arming himself in the cause of
freedom. He had not thought of joining
Washington, if he should withdraw from
Howe and the service; or if such ideas
had occurred to him they were vague
and indecisive. His notion was to
remain
a quiet spectator of the contest,
thinking he should have done all that
his sense of justice required of him, in
refusing to participate longer in a system
of aggression which he felt was both
unjust
and tyrannical.
Such were Neal's feelings when he
received the reproof from his uncle which
had offended his pride. `I will from
this time cease to share in this quarrel.
No gratitude binds me to my uncle!
No honor binds me to my country's
service
in a wicked cause. I will resign
and let the odium of that invasion of the
colonies rest with those who war against
them. I will bear none of it longer on
my conscience!'
It was with such feelings that he left
his presence and sought secretly the
abode of Colonel Park. This
gentleman
had been a distinguished officer in
the early French wars and had returned
from the army a few years before the
breaking out of the revolution, and
resumed
the practice of the law in Boston.
Here he resided when General Gage then
in command, committed those acts of
aggression
upon private property and
liberty
which drew upon him the scorn of
all men and raised the spirit of
resistance
.
Boston was surrounded by an
army and Gage began to fortify the town
to stand a siege. The citizens in alarm
began to fly to the country lest they
should be shut up with the garrison.
At first he permitted them to go after
first stacking their arms in Fanuiel Hall;
but discovering that they conveyed away
a great deal of valuable property beside
provisions, and seeing that each man
would increase the strength of the rebel
forces, he suddenly issued an order
forbidding
any more to depart. The
promulgation
of this order found a large
number of the citizens still in town, who
were subsequently involved in all the
miseries
of the siege of sixteen months which
followed. Among these citizens was
Colonel Parks and his family, which
consisted
of a nephew and neice and a
maiden
sister. The nephew succeeded
afterwards
in effecting his escape and
joining
Washington. When this was
discovered
,
a sentry was placed at the door
of the family mansion. One day not long
after the guard was placed there, Neal
was passing and saw a young and
beautiful
girl endeavoring to prevail upon him
to permit her to enter the house. Neal
saw that the soldier was insolent and the
female very much alarmed; for two or
three tipsy young officers were crossing
the street towards her, singing a gay song.
`What means this, fellow?'
demanded
Neal of the sentinel.
`I have orders not let any one pass
out without a permit!' answered the man
respectfully, as he recognised the
general's
nephew.
`You wish to go in, I believe,' said
Neal, addressing the shrinking and
terrified
girl.
`Yes, sir.'
He regarded her an instant with deep
admiration and then said, with courtesy,
`Suffer me to escort you! The
soldier
is insolent and shall be arrested.'
He offered her his arm and attended
her to the door of the mansion. The
grateful girl turned and thanked him with
a glanced that thrilled to his soul, and in
a voice that sounded sweeter to his
charmed ears than any music that had
ever fallen upon them.
She was scarcely eighteen, with
heavenly
blue eyes, and soft fair hair, and
one of those pure complexions that are
the index of a sunny spirit. She was
slight in person, and airy as a sylph in
her movements. Neal's heart was at
once taken captive. Yet the lovely
Anna
Parks was all unconscious of her
power.
`You will be so kind as to come in
and let my uncle thank you, sir,' she
said, in a way that was totally
irresistiable
.
`I ought not to have gone out
without him; but a poor woman whose
son is in prison on suspicion of having
tried to escape to the army, and who is
in great distress sent for me: and
forgetful
of the peril of being abroad I
hastended
to her. On my return another
soldier
was on duty before the door who
refused
to let me enter, when you were so
good as to interpose in my behalf.'
`I am most happy to serve you. The
sentry shall be at once and altogether
removed
from your door.'
`I thank you, sir, if you have
influence
enough with General Howe!'
`You may depend upon the removal of
this annoyance,' he said very decidedly.
He accepted his invitation to enter the
house, wondering how so much beauty
had been so long secluded in the town
from his view or knowledge. He did
not go in because he wished her father to
be thanked. The gratitude of the lovely
provincial was enough. He wished to
know and see more of her and to learn
who she could be.
The result of all was that he became
a frequent guest at the house of the old
soldier, passing there the hours in which
he absented himself from his quarters.
Colonel Parks soon discovered the worth
and excellency of character in his young
visitor, and conversed with him freely
upon the state of affairs, conveying
instruction
and truth in all he said. Neal
became a gratified listener, for Anne, in
whom he had discovered a playmate of
his childhood, listened also! In this way
he became acquainted with the great
principles which actuated the Americans,
and convinced of the injustice of
England
.
Neither father nor daughter used
an argument to bring him over to the
provincial party. Colonel Parks
contented
himself with stating facts, leaving
the result to his own mind. Anne had
faith that its final decision would be the
right one.
Colonel Parks was too honorable also
to seek to corrupt the integrity of his
young friend by drawing from him
information
that might be useful to
Washington
;
and Neal was too faithful, while he
remained in the service of the king, to
betray
the trust reposed in him.
The visits of Neal to the house of the
provincial were made always by night,
and with caution; for he did not like the
ridicule of the officers, and he feared, too,
that his motives might be misinterpreted
to the injury of the fair girl's good name.
He also did not like to give occasion for
any suspicion to be fastened upon his
loyalty
.
The withdrawal of the sentry
favored
the secrecy of his visits. Colonel
Parks was not blind to the attachment of
the young aid de camp to his niece; nor
that it was reciprocated by her. But he
had no fears of the integrity of the young
man, for whom he himself had conceived
a strong affection.
Affairs remained in this condition up
to the stormy evening on which we
accompany
him on his usual visit to the
house of the venerable provincial.
CHAPTER VI.
THE MESSENGER FROM THE REBEL CAMP.
Before
Neal could decide what sort
of a reply to make to the searching
question
of the old Provincial Colonel, the
door of an inner room opened and Anne
Park came in. She smiled, but
blushed
also as she gave her hand to Neal who
rose and approached her with ardent
affection
beaming in his fine countenance.
Our hero's cheek reflected the rich hue
of her own, as he pressed her small, warm
hand in his and led her to the vacant
seat.
`You were sitting here at your
embroidery
,
Anne,' he said, tenderly, `and run
away when I knocked! Did you think
I was a stranger? Have you forgotten
my rap?' and he smiled in her eye, and
she looked down as she replied,
`No, but .' Here she
hesitated
and took up her work.
`But she did not think she was in
trim to see you, I suspect,' said her
uncle
;
for I see that she has not on the
same dress that .'
`
Dear
uncle .'
`Well, I wont expose you, child?'
`I think you have done so already,'
she answered, laughing.
`I am sorry you should make a
stranger
of me more than you would of your
brother,' said Neal. `Have you heard
from him of late?'
`Not for two weeks. I am very
anxious
to learn if he is well!'
`If he had been ill you would have
heard from him.'
`Perhaps not,' said Colonel Park; `
besides
communication is now nearly im
possible, both sides observes such
vigilance
!
But I trust he is well and
serving
his country faithfully.
The old gentleman then took his pipe
in his hand, as if he learned from
expression
,
that Neal had no ear for him
while Anne was by; and saying he
believed
he would go into his bed-room and
smoke, he rose and left the lovers
together
.
Neal looked very well pleased, and
taking
up Anne's hand he pressed it to his
lips; and then would have drawn her
towards
him with his arm about her
slender
waist when she reservedly drew back.
`Why, Anne! This is not usual!' he
exclaimed, hurt.
`I have been thinking, Neal .'
And she hesitated, and in trying to take
a stitch in her work pricked her finger
with her needle.
`What have you been thinking, dear
Anne?'
`That we ought not to be so intimate.'
`Do you not love me then?'
`I will not unsay what I have said!'
she said, quietly.
`Then you do love me! If so, why
shrink from me, as you did at this
moment
?'
`I have thought .'
`Thought! I wish you would let your
thoughts alone, Anne, if they are to
grieve me in this way.'
`I do not wish to grieve you, Neal,
indeed
,
I do not,' she said earnestly.
`But we ought not to see each other any
more! You do not now come here to
converse with my uncle but to sit with
me!'
`And do you not like it? Does it
displease
you?'
`Oh, no! But I know it will end in
making us both very unhappy.
`Why? How, dearest Anne?'
`I will deal frankly, Neal,' said the
beautiful provincial maiden elevating
her deep, blue eyes to his face beaming
with an expression full of sincerity and
devotion; `we are both very much
attached
to each other. Each day will
strengthen it in both our hearts! In a
few weeks General Howe will depart or
surrender, my uncle thinks, and then we
must separate, you to go to England or
perhaps to prison, and I shall be left in
tears and .'
Here her voice trembled and her eyes
filled with glittering drops.
`Why should we separate?' he said
with warmth. `I will not go to England!
I will not leave you! If I go to England
by and by you shall accompany me as
my bride! Naylook not so coldly.
Have I not before breathed to thee this
sweet wordthis delightful thought?
Why this grave look that you wear?
`It is because I can never be yours,
Neal, that I look gravethat I have said
our intimacy should cease?'
`And why shall you not be mine? I
am youngbut in less than a year I
shall be of age, and inherit a fortune left
me by my aunt. You shall live with me
in England and .'
`I can never live in the land of my
country's oppressors!' she said firmly,
yet with a cheek very pale.
Neal started with surprise. He
regarded
her for a moment with looks of
sadness.
`Yes, it is the land of oppression to
you, Anne! You speak truly!
England
is unjust. But there will be peace
by and by. Then your objection will
be removed.'
`I cannot be the bride of one who
now, there is war, is in arms on the side
of my country's oppressors?'
`Anne! are you in earnest?'
`Do you wish me to repeat my words,
Neal?'
`No. They are ringing now in my
ears! Is this decision the result of what
you have been thinking upon?'
`Yes'
`And you are firm?'
`Neal; strongly as my heart is linked
to you, I would break it ere I would
become
your wife while you are in arms
against the land of my birth. I should
be unworthy to be called an American
woman should I forget my country in
myself, Neal.'
`It is a noble sentiment, Anne! A
cause must prosper that inspires such a
spirit throughout all classes without
distinction
of age or sex as this which you
love so warmly. From this hour, Anne
I cease to serve the king!' he added,
with decision. `I will to-morrow
tender
my resignation to General Howe and
also to Admiral Shuldan. I confess that
I ought not to continue in arms with the
opinions I entertain and which I have
learned from your uncle and you. I
will frankly confess to my uncle my
objections
to serving longer, and then, free
as the bird that hastens from the storm
cloud to its nest, will I fly to you. I
have been offended by my uncle to-night,
and I owe him little ingratitude.
Tomorrow
I will resign and come hither
and lay my sword at your feet.'
`Are you sincere! Can I believe
this, Neal?' asked the young girl with
cheeks glowing with pleasure and her
eyes sparkling with delighted hope.
`For your sake I will to-morrow cease
to sanction this war of oppression by
attaching
myself to its leaders! You shall
then be mine! I will sail with you and
my mother to France and there remain
till peace is restored and then return to
England!'
`Neal, are you of Englandare you
English born that you must think only of
that proud and wicked land! You as
well as I are American born. Boston is
your native townNew England your
native land. What have you to do with
England but to resist her oppression of
your country? You have not done
enough when you only resign? You
have not done what is due to yourself,
Neal, when you only cease to serve the
tyrant?'
`What could you have me do more,
Anne? Turn traitor and take up arms
against the king?'
`Is there any alternation for a brave
man who has arrived to a true knowledge
of his country's wrongs? Your reward
is due to America! Your arms, your
voice, your influence, your country most
sacredly claims! You have been a
traitor
,
Neal, to her not to be so to England.
Have I not heard you speak with
pleasure
of your boyhood, and nay, have I not
heard you express your happiness that
you were born where I was? What is
there that attaches me to New England
that does not equally bind you? What
is their that makes an Americana
patriot
that does not make you the same?
Throw off this blind prejudice, which,
like a veil obscure the true nobility of
your soul, Neal, and from this hour give
to your country your sword and, if need,
your life. You are convinced of the
oppression
and tyranny of the king and of
the injustice of his cause. What more
should you do but to bear testimony to
your sense of her injustice by aiding your
oppressed countrymen to resist it. Do
not foreigners, from love of liberty and
hatred of oppression, flock to our
standard
!
and lay down their lives upon a
soil far from their own! What higher
motive have you who .'
`Enoughenough, dearest Anne,'
exclaimed
Neal, kneeling on one knee by
the side of the eloquent girl, who,
inspired
by patriotic love for her country and
her solicitude for the honor of him whom
she so devotedly loved; `you have
prevailed
!
I feel as if I had just awakened
from a lethargy! You are right! I have
been a traitor to my country! I will
return from my allegiance. From this
hour I am an American.'
The ardent and joyful girl could not
restrain the tears that rushed to her eyes.
She suffered him to press her to his
heart unresistingly.
`Now, Neal, I am happy. Oh, how I
have longed to make this appeal to you;
but I have refrained, not wishing to
influence
you, lest I might be actuated in
doing so, by selfish rather than by the
higher motives which ought to govern
me. But you have made me happy.
You will now be joined hand in hand
with my noble brother instead of against
him, and '
`And with the sister heart and hand
instead of separating from her,'
continued
Neal, with a smile. `I have been, it
seems wilfully blind. I never can be too
grateful to you, Anne, for teaching me
my duty. I am an American. I will
prove myself to be one.'
At this moment the hall door softly
opened, and a man enveloped in snow
from head to foot entered, and stood
gazing
upon them with an air of hesitation
and wariness, as if doubtful whether to
advance or retreat. At first his
complexion
could not be made out for the
snow that lay on his cheeks, but as it was
rapidly dissolving it displayed shortly the
glossy hue of an Ethiopian.
`It is Jesse!' cried Anne, springing
from her chair and running towards him.
`Who can `Jesse' be?' thought Neal,
as he surveyed the tall, ungainly shape of
the negro.
`Jesse! bless us, is Jesse here?' cried
the old officer coming in with his pipe
in one hand and his red night cap in the
other; and hastening up to the new
comner
he dragged him to the fire by one
hand, while Anne drew him along by
the other.
`Who
can
Jesse be?' repeated Neal,
mentally, at this demonstration of joy
and friendship.
`How
have
you got into the town,
Jesse
?'
inquired Anne, as she untied a large
muffler that enveloped `Jesse's' neck.
`And where is Frederick?' asked the
Colonel, as he pushed the old negro into
his own arm chair.
`Is he well, and why have you come,
and in such a storm? What can have
made you venture to try and see us
through so many dangers?'
`Why, Miss Anny, and master,'
answered
Jesse, after having taken off his
fur cap, displaying a head as grey with
age as his coat collar was with snow,
`it a mos' unpossible for de poor nigger
answer sich a sight o' questions all at
onct. I'se glad I got here safe tho' and
bress de lord I finds you both safe and
well.'
`Where did you leave my brother?'
asked Anne. `This, Neal,' she added
observing his look of curiosity, `this is
our old servant who accompanied
Frederic
in his escape from the town five
months ago when he went to join
Washington
.
We have not seen him since
then; and so you will not be longer
surprised
at our reception of him. `Where
is Frederick? is he well and did he send
you?'
`I werry sorry, missis, but young
master ant verry well,' responded the
old man shaking his head sadly.
`Sick? my dear brother ill?'
`Is my boy hurtis he wounded?'
`Yes, master, that is it! You see
yesterday dere was a boat full o'
waluable
perwissions and arms goin' to the
merikan army from below when de wind
blow contrary and drive de boat over on
to de flat on dis side; and when de
English
see it dey start a hundred red coat
from deir lines to take it. Master
Frederick
he vos ridin' with about twenty
horse along the shore goin' to relieve a
post, when he sees the perdikament of
the boat and gives the command to his
men to keep the English from gettin' it.
So they galloped on for more than a mile
fast as they could spur and reaches the
boat first. But the English comed up
and attack 'em, but master Frederick
had so much fight in him be sarved 'em
so they run'd away and then he got the
boat safe; but he was shot bad in the
side and in the forehead, though he didn't
mind it till he got the boat clear. But
there was five o' the English killed and
seventeen wounded, and this was
satisfaction
to me and master Edward wy he
and I was the ony one's hit on our side!'
`I heard of the exploit, but did'nt
know that the gallant cavalry officer who
executed it was my nephew,' said the old
soldier with a tone of pride while tears
glistened in his eyes. `Thank God he
was not killed.'
`Oh, tell me Jesse, is he badly hurt?'
cried Anne, pale with sisterly alarm.
`Why pretty bad, missis! He cant
set up and his head pains him werry hard!
The doctor distract one ball from his
side and a half a ball from his forehead,
coz you see that the bone split it. But
he ant in no danger! He ony told me
to try and get into the town and tell you
'xactly how he was so you mustn't be
alarmed: for he was 'fraid you might
hear he was killed out and out!'
`Then he is in no present danger,
good Jesse?' asked the Colonel.
`No, master! he ony have good deal
pain!'
`And do you say you were in the
skirmish!'
`Yes, master! I always go where
young master goes!'
`And where were you wounded? not
badly, I hope!' said the Colonel with
concern.
`Not much master. I ony got a shot
in de lef arm. Its ony a flesh wound!
Doctor sew it up and nigger good as
new!'
`Are you sure you are not much hurt,
Jesse?' inquired Anne with beautiful
solicitude, for the moment forgetting her
brother in her grateful interest in the
fate of his faithful servant.
`Not a bit! De doctor cut him
bullet
out clean, and dere he is,' he added
taking the leaden missile out of his
pocket
and exhibiting to them. `I keep him,
master, coz I mean to send him back
again to 'em afore a week!'
`And how did you get in so safely,
brave Jesse, with all the avenues so
vigilantly
kept?' asked Neal.
Jesse surveyed the speaker a moment
and discovering the English uniform he
started back, as if he had for the first
time noticed him.
`Bress me, ant this a enemy, master?'
`No, Jesse. He is an American and
a true friend of the cause,' answered
Anne with a tone of pride.
`Has he, indeed, become one of us,
Anne?' asked Colonel Park with a glow
of pleasure.
`Yes, sir; I am now worthy of the
land of my birth,' answered Neal firmly.
`I have seen that the officer who feels
the injustice of England has something
more to do than resign and return home!
especially if he be by birth an American!
My decision is made. I resign
to-morrow
and the sword I withdraw from
tyranny
I consecrate to liberty!'
The old Provincial officer made no
reply
;
but he went up and embraced him
and called him affectionately `his son!'
`Come and kiss him, girl!' he said to
Anne. `He deserves this!'
Anne did not obey. Perhaps she
thought Neal had already taken his
reward
!
She blushed deeply and looked
very happy. But the next instant the
situation of her brother filled all her
thoughts.
`If this young gemman be a true
friend then I answers his question,' said
Jesse. `I lef the camp just afore dark
and made for the lines. I know'd the
snow and dark would help me, and so I
walked on fast. When I got near the
lines it was dark as pitch and the snow
as thick as feathers. So I kep' along
till I come to the first sentry. But he
didn't see me for the snowand taking
care of his own eyes and I went by him
within two rods. In dis way I passed
'em all but de last one when I step on a
stick which crack and he look and see
me. But afore he could fire I caught
him by de froat and fling him down and
stuff his mouth full o' snow keep him
from hollerin' and dere leave him arter
I'd taken his gun. And when I lef him
I advise him to go over to the rebels for
if General Howe knew he'd lost his mus
ket he'd have him shot. He got rite
up and went strait as I advise, like a
wise man! The rest o' the way I got
here easy enuff. I stood my musket up
in the back entry coz I crept in the
house that way!'
You have done bravely, Jesse,' said
Colonel Park. Now relieve Anne's
anxiety
who fears you have not told all the
truth about her brother! Is your young
master in any danger?'
`Wal, to tell the truth his situation is
pretty bad.'
`Did he not tell you to represent his
case as lightly as possible?' asked Anne.
`That is just his words, Miss Anne.'
`He must be dangerously wounded,
uncle! Oh, that I was with him. In
the camp and without proper attention
he will sufferperhaps die! I might save
his life. Where is he, Jesse? Where
did you leave him?'
`At General Washington's own
quarters
The General had him removed
there.'
`Then he must be very ill to call for
such attention. Jesse, do you intend to
return to-night?'
`Yes, misses! I mean to go rite back.'
`Then I will accompany you.'
`You, Anne!' exclaimed her uncle and
Neal in the same breath.
`I must see my brother! I must be
near him to nurse him in his illness!
I will brave every danger. Is he not
wounded in the service of his country!
What can woman do less than devote
herself to those who bleed for this
struggling
land. What can a sister do but
watch by a brother's couch. I am
resolved
uncle! I will go out of the city
with Jesse! If he can risk his life for
Frederick, shall not I?'
`Nothing is impossible to resolute
affection
and sacred duty.'
`The fatigue.' said Neal.
`I shall not feel it!'
`The peril'
`Shall I fear any that I may reach my
wounded brother's side? Jesse, refresh
yourself, and in an hour I will be ready
to go with you.'
`If this is your determination, Anne,'
said Neal, `I will go also. I shall thus
prove to you the sincerity of my
conversion
!'
CHAPTER VII.
THE RUSE.
The
limits of our story will not permit
us to accompany the party, composed of
Neal, Anne and the faithful black, each
step of their progress on their dangerous
enterprise. Favored by the storm and
darkness and by the direction of the sentry
whom Jesse had disarmed, they passed
the out posts and reached the American
lines in safety. Neal's British uniform
was concealed by his seaman's jacket,
in which he had enveloped himself.
Anne was protected by a cloak and furs
and bravely stood the fatigue of the three
miles walk which intervened between the
out posts of the British garrison and the
centre of the American camp at
Cambridge
.
Jesse proved an excellent guide; and
always having ready pass-word and
countersign
when chalenged, in two hours
after, leaving her uncle's house within the
besieged town, Anne was in front of the
quarters occupied by General
Washington
.
Neal's feelings were sufficiently novel
at finding himself in the American camp,
and about to be ushered within the
presence
of the Commander-in-chief of the
army opposed to that commanded by his
uncle and to which he had hitherto owed
service and allegiance. But he did not
hesitate. He had no feeling of regret.
He had become fully alive to the course
of duty: and if duty and honor did not
point him to serve the American cause,
love for the fair girl resting upon his arm
undisputably did so.
The hour was near midnight; but
lights were visible in several of the
windows
as, after passing the sentry, Jesse
knocked at the door. It was opened by
a black footman who, recognising Jesse,
threw wide the door and admitted them.
`How is Master Frederick?' asked
Jesse in a low tone.
`About as he was when you left him,
but some little more fever! He has asked
after you a good many times.'
`Miss Anny, you and young master
Neal stop here in the hall a bit; and I'll
jist go up and tell him you are here and
all about it, so he need'nt be took by
surprise.'
The hall in which Jesse left them
plainly enough indicated the military
occupation
of the house. Swords, and
belts, chapeous and pistols were hanging
from pegs around the walls or strewn on
the tables and settees. Military uniform
and camp-coats lay about, and the place
had that air of negligence which a
common
hall might be supposed to wear after
midnight when all had retired.
`Which is General Washington's
apartment?' asked Neal of the footman.
`That front one,' he answered
pointing
to a door on their left. `It is
sleeping
and eating room. The other rooms
are occupied by his staff, and one by
young Captain Parks who was wounded
yesterday in rescuing a barge from the
enemy.'
`Was he badly wounded?' asked Anne
tremblingly.
`He received a spent ball in his
forehead
,
and was severely wounded in the
side; but the doctors think he may live.'
`
May
live? Then is his danger
imminent
.
I can never be too thankful,
Neal, that I have come.'
`I fear your fatigue and exposure will
endanger your own life, dear Anne.'
`No. I can never suffer from what I
have this night done. Here comes Jesse.'
`Come up, Miss Anne! Master
Frederick
is told you is here. He wants to
see you.'
Anne flew up the stairs, but Neal
folowed
at her side.
`I will not go in at present, Anne!
I would you should first let him know who
I am! I hope you will find him better
than you hope for.'
The reception of Anne by her brother
was very affecting. He blamed her for
adventuring so much, but expressed his
gratitude in the same words, that she was
with him. She found that he had fever
but was without pain, though he had been
severely wounded.
`Is there no danger of your dying, my
dear brother?' she asked with solicitude.
`None! The wounds are not mortal.
But the doctor says I must be kept quiet;
and that every thing depends on good
nursing for a week or two. I am glad
you are here! You were very kind and
brave to come! And how you have
changed! You are paler yet lovelier than
when we parted six months ago! Are
you not wearied with your walk?'
`Neal and Jesse carried me in their
arms a great part of the way.'
`Noble Jesse! And who is this Neal,
sister, that has risked danger with you!
Jesse says he is a young English officer!
Can it be possible.'
In a few words, with hesitation and
blnshing that betrayed to her brother the
secret of her heart, she told him who he
was; beginning with her first seeing him
when he rebuked the insolence of the
sentry up to the present evening.
`The nephew of General Howe! and
an American by birth! Educated in
England and attached to its naval service;
and now an aid of the Fnglish General!
I have heard of him! I trust he is all
you say he is; and that his conversion is
sincere!'
`It is brother! you have evidence of
it in his being now in the American
camp!'
`Let me be made known to him!
Nay, don't object! I shan't talk too
much. I wish to see him, and thank
him. I wish Washington also to know
him!'
Neal was in a moment or two
afterwards
introduced by Anne to her brother.
The two young men met with frankness
and mutual prepossession for each other.
In a few minutes they conversed together
like long known friends. Neal freely
discussed the change in his views and
feelings and spoke of his intention to
join the American Army so soon as he
should resign his present position.
`Resign?' exclaimed Frederic.
`Yes. I intend to return to the city
before dawn and seeking an interview
with my uncle freely and openly
explain
to him my intention no longer
to bear arms against my native country!
I might now remain with your army,' he
added, `but I do not wish to take the
step I contemplate in a clandestine way.
I will resign in person into my uncle's
hands the trust I received at them and
returning to Admiral Shuldam my
commission
,
will again see you!'
It was in vain that both urged him to
stay while he was in safety. In vain Anne
held out to him the probability that his
uncle would place him under arrest as a
traitor or hold him in prison as a rebel.
Neal's high sense of honor was superior
even to the wishes and tears of Anne:
and after remaining two hours with them
he took his leave promising soon to
return
.
The storm which still raged favored
his entrance into the city. The
morning
found him early in his uncle's
presence
,
which he had sought with the
merely patriotic determination to
resign
his position and explain to him his
reasons for so doing. But the time
happened
to be rife with excitement on
account
of a rumor that the citizen rebels
had formed a plan to fire the town and
then compel the garrison to leave the
place. General Howe was surrounded
with officers and messengers, and Neal
postponed his purpose till another time.
He then went privately to inform Colonel
Park of the success of Anne's escape and
the condition of his nephew. He at the
same time laid before him his intention.
The Colonel tried to prevail upon him to
give up this `Quixotic idea' as he
termed
it, assuring him that Howe would put
him under arrest.
Neal promised to think upon it? but
Colonel Parks would take no delay of
decision, and Neal finally consented to
depart, leaving a letter behind to his
uncle
explaining his motives. The letter
was written and Neal was about to take
his final departure under cover of the
darkness and had walked to the mansion
of Colonel Parks to bid him adieu when
he found the house in the possession of
a guard of soldiers. On inquiring he
learned that the old soldier had been
arrested
on suspicion of communicating
with the enemy.
Angry, grieved and surprised at this
intelligence, Neal felt, nevertheless, that
if he wished to serve him effectually he
must act with caution and secrecy.
Instead
,
therefore of obeying the first
impulse
of his feelings, and going to his
uncle and demanding his release, he
resolved
to learn first the facts of his
arrest
and what particulars he had been
charged with.
He, at length, learned that Jesse had
been followed from the lines by a tory
who was skulking about seeking for
plunder, and who saw him cross there
disarming the soldier and proceed to the
house of Colonel Parks, and, that
afterwards
saw three persons leave it, whom
he followed and saw pass the post into
the country. This account confirmed
by the absence of the run-a-away
sentry
had led to the arrest of the venerable
patriot.
Until he should effect his release, Neal
resolved to be silent respecting his change
of opinion; for he knew that if his
uncle
knew that he was a friend to the
rebels
his opportunity for aiding the father
of Anne would be lost. With some
management he succeeded in getting an
interview with the Colonel in prison to
whom he made known his purpose of
affecting
his release, either by entreaty or
stratagem.
It was several days before Neal
became
fully satisfied that it was his
uncle's
intentions to keep the old soldier a
close prisoner in spite of all his efforts in
his behalf; and of the petitions of the
American citizens in the town for his
liberation
.
Three nights of this period of
imprisonment
,
Neal had passed in the
American
camp, whither, having the pass of the
garrison, he went without any difficulty.
With Anne and her brother he here
discussed
plans for the release of the
prisoner
:
and returned to town before
morning
to try and carry them into execution.
But all his schemes failed from the fact
that the guard over the prisoner was
unusually
strict; and that his apartment
was changed every night, lest there should
be an attempt made to aid his escape, for
General Howe was aware tha, the
citizens
were highly indignant at the arrest
of the venerable soldier and patriot whom
they believed was innocent of the charge
brought against him.
Affairs were in this situation when the
English General ordered Neal, who still
held his post near him in the hope of yet
aiding the prisoner by his presence, to
summon the selectmen of the town to a
consultation.
[2]
[2]
The reader is referred back to chapter III.
The assembling of the rulers of the
city, and the conference between them
and Sir William Howe has already been
made known, with the subsequent truce
and evacuation of the town by the enemy.
Having now brought up our story to the
evening of Neals departure from General
Howe's head quarters to summon the
selectmen
to wait upon him, we will now
follow him in his farther adventures.
We have now seen that his uncle's
suspicions
were not without good ground;
and that if he had been cognizant of what
is known to the reader, instead of
sending
his nephew on a mission to the
selectmen
he would have sent him under
guard to prison.
Neal delivered his several messages to
the members of the corporation and then,
from the town hall, took his way rapidly
in the direction of the prison where
Colonel
Parks was confined. Although he
had in no one act betrayed Sir William
Howe's confidence in him by giving the
information he might have done to
Washington
,
concerning the garrison, he now
resolved, since he saw that his uncle had
suspicions of his loyalty, to use the power
his position near him gave him to see the
prisoner, and boldly effect his release.
The evening before when he parted from
Anne in his brother's room, he had
pledged himself that he would not cross
the lines again but in company with her
uncle. He now resolved to redeem this
pledge.
`Who is on guard to night?' he asked
of a sergeant who stood in front of the
prison.
`I am with my men!'
Then my business is with you,
Murray
!'
`What is your wish, sir?'
`The prisoner, Colonel Parks I wish
brought out privately, and escorted to
Head Quarters! Yourself and four men
will serve a sufficient detachment!'
The sergeant did not hesitate to obey
an order brought by the nephew of the
General. He led the way into the
prison
and showed Neal into the apartment
where the old soldier was confined.
`Orders, sir to march under guard to
Head-Quarters,' said the sergeant in a
formal tone. `Get ready to leave.'
On seeing Neal Colonel Parks was
about to express his pleasure when the
young man placed his fore finger on his
lip, with a look of caution.
`Sergeant, I will assist the prisoner in
getting his over-coat on, while you draw
out your men,' and the sergeant retired
along the gloomy corridor of the prison.
`Now, my friend, I am about to restore
you to liberty and to your family,' said
Neal quickly. `I have done all I can to
effect your release by an honorable
discharge
;
but in vain. Within three days
the garrison will withdraw from the town,
and I fear you may be conveyed on board
one of the ships and there held prisoner
till you can be exchanged. I am also
suspected and may share your fate. The
sergeant will escort you out to the
Head-Quarters
of Sir William Howe. All
you have to do is to follow me and I will
conduct you to your neice.'
The sergeant soon returned to receive
the prisoner, and escorted by four
soldiers
the prisoner left, leaning on Neal's
arm. The night was dark but clear, and
the hour about half past seven. The
escort
took its way through Common street
into Beacon and so up to the
Head-Quarters
of the General. They halted at the
gate at the foot of the steep flight of steps
where stood a sentry.
`Halt, here, sergeant with your
prisononer
till I return to you,' said Neal.
He then ascended to the door and
entered
the hall with a bold, free tread.
He learned from a servant that his uncle
was already in conference with the
seectmen
.
`Then all is as I expected it would
be! The way will be free!' he said with
animation. He was about to return to
the sargeant, when his mother seeing him,
approached from the extremity of the
hall.
`Neal, I am glad you are returned. I
would speak with you.'
`Well, mother.'
`This is no place. Come into my
room.'
`I am somewhat engaged. But I will
give you a moment here, mother.'
`Do you know your uncle suspects
you of being disloyal to the king's cause.'
`Yes; he told me as much! But my
uncle's suspicions are not confirmed.'
`I do not like your tone, Neal. If I
thought you were false to your country I
would be the first to cry out for your
arrest
!'
`I am false to my country only when
I take sides with its oppressors, mother,'
said Neal evasively, `What have you
more to say, dear mother?'
`To caution you! If you are getting
rebel notions, banish them! You are in
danger! My brother will not spare even
you!'
`Mother, why should I
not
be a rebel?'
he said with a smile. Is not America
my birth-place? Did not England drive
you and my father to these shores?
What harm or wonder would there be if
I should be a little rebelish! But here
is a packet for you, which I wish you to
read, dear mother! I have another,
something similar, for my uncle. Good
night! I shall soon see you again.'
Thus speaking, he pressed her hand,
and hurriedly descended the steps to
where he had left the sergeant with the
prisoner.
`Sergeant, the general is at this
moment
engaged in council. You will
march your prisoner up the yard by the
wall, and so to the side door.'
The sergeant obeyed, and halted his
men at a door that led from the carriage
yard up to the kitchen.
`You will wait here with your men till
the prisoner returns.' he said. `Follow
me, sir!' he added sternly to the
prisoner
.
He entered the door and ascended a
steep, winding stair-way, closely followed
by the Colonel. At the landing he
turned
to the right, and traversing a narrow
passage, opened a door at its extremity
which led into the garden.
`Now, my dear sir, lean on me and
move on as quickly as possible!' said
Neal giving him his arm.
He rapidly crossed the lower parterre
and then ascending the steps of the
terrace
to the summer-house, passed it, and
crossing the elevated summit of the
garden
,
descended by a steep path on the
farther side which terminated in a gate.
They passed through this, and entered a
lane which led towards the water-side on
the west of the town.
`Now, my dear friend,' said Neal, `we
are almost in security. You can
understand
now that the order to march you
from prison to the head-quarter's was a
ruse to deceive the sergeat, and get you
from his power! In five minutes more,
if all is as I hope for, we shall be beyond
pursuit. But there is little probability
that my uncle will end his conference
under an hour, and during that time the
sergeant and his men will not discover
the deception I have practiced on them.
`Noble young man! I know not how
to thank you for your interest in my
behalf
.'
`I am fully rewarded in your liberty,
sir,' answered Neal, who also thought of
the sweet reward he should be sure to
obtain from her whom he loved better
than life.
In ten minutes after leaving the
garden-gate
they came to the water-side at
a point where a ravine penetrated the
land for some rods. Here Neal stopped
and listened. As he did so he heard on
one side and on the other of him the cries
of the sentinels that guarded the beach of
`All's well,' sound answering to sound,
for many a winding mile of the guarded
shore. He could also hear it from the
American side coming faintly and
far-distant
over the water. After all was
still he took up a stone and threw it far
out into the dark water. After a pause
long enough to count fifty, he cast
another
.
A third, after a similar interval
followed
,
each striking sharp into the wave
like the light splash of a small fish
springing
into the air and falling back again.
The fall of the last stone was answered
by three low splashes upon the water not
many yards off; but in the darkness
nothing
was visible.
`The cry of all's well, has alarmed
the fish, Bill,' said one sentry calling to
another.
`Yes, they seem to be quite lively
tonight
.
But when one wants to catch one
to keep from starving, they are as scarce
as guineas in a canteen.'
`I am glad they are gossiping to one
another,' said Neal. `Now step softly,
sir. The breaking of a dry stick would
betray us.'
CHAPTER VIII.
THE ESCAPE.
Neal
took the old patriot by the hand
and led him with caution along the
bottom
of the ravine and following it about
twelve yards they came to its outlet.
Here they stopped and Neal looked
abroad upon the water and listened.
The next moment he saw a boat appear
close at hand and moving with noiseless
celerity. It touched the shore. The
faint outline of a single human figure
was perceptible in the bow.
`Jesse!' whispered Neal.
`Master Nelson!' answered the
negro
in the same cautious tone. `I glad
you here! Is dat old massa?'
`Yes. Push your boat round so he
can step into the stern! Be cautious
for there are enemies close at hand!'
`I knows it! I have been layin' off
here two hour and hear 'em talk! Bless
you old massa! Missy Anny be mighty
glad see you!'
`Hist, Jesse!' said Neal warningly.
The old man stepped by his aid into
the skiff, and Neal springing in Jesse
pushed it noiselessly from the bank and
shot out into the bay. Not a word was
spoken for some minutes. Neal sat
watching anxiously the shore and Jesse
plied the paddle with perseverance and
skill.
Gradually the confused sounds of the
town grew less and less distinguishable
and the lights of the American camp
increased
in size.
`Now, Colonel,' said Neal taking his
hand in his and pressing it warmly, `now,
sir, you are free! We are beyond
pursuit
!
Our escape has been
undiscovered
!'
`Thanks! blessings on your head!'
answered the grateful American.
`Massa let Jesse shake hands wid you
too!'
`Yes, Jesse, I shall never forget you.
But is it you were waiting there!'
`That is my plan,' answered Neal.
`For five nights Jesse has been waiting
in this skiff off that inlet. Only to-night
has he been successful with taking you
on board. I arranged that he should
come for I did not know what might
occur
and I wanted some means of getting
you to the main land knowing you could
not well stand the land route by the
rock. The signal which you heard us
exchange I also arranged with Jesse.
Too much praise cannot be bestowed
upon
him for his faithful watching and
his skill and caution in bringing the plan
to a successful termination! I resolved,
sir, a week ago that, if you were not
released
by the General I would release
you though at the expense of the
confidence
he placed in me!'
`If you are a true born American and
really love your country and feel for her
wrongs now that you know them, you
have broken no faith! you have done
nothing but what in war is declared
lawful
and honorable!'
`I do not feel any regret, I have well
weighed the result. I only wish my
mother was with me in the cause I have
now espoused!'
`She is a strong partisan of the royal
side?' Yes. But I have written and
left with her a letter in which I have gone
over the whole ground of my change of
opinion with all its probable arguments.
I have told her that if she is convinced
that England is wrong and American right
she will remain in the city when the
garrison
is withdrawn; for, sir, not many
hours hence Sir William will retire, if
he can do so unmolested, on board the
shipping!'
`This an event devoutly to be wished?'
`I
know
that this is his purpose. So I
have left it with my mother either to
remove
and be with me or to depart with
the General. I have told her if she
proposes
going to England I will visit her
after the war is ended! I trust she will,
however, conclude to favor the American
cause, and cast in her lot with mine!'
The boat at length arrived on the
patriot
side of the Back bay and the party
landed: Jesse drawing the skiff up high
on shore and concealing it under some
bushes that overhung the bank.
Conducted
by Neal the escaped prisoner then
took his way in the direction of the
American camp, at which all three
arrived
about ten o'clock, two and a half
hours after leaving the sergeant and his
men standing guard before the side door
at the head quarters of the English
General
.
On the departure of the Selectmen
from the presence of Sir William Howe
after their conference, a rap at his door
called his attention from the deep
meditation
into which he had fallen upon the
fearful crisis of affairs.
`Come in!' he answered and
advancing
a step towards the door as if
anticipating
who it was.
`Ah, you are returned!' he said to the
person he had ordered to follow Neal.
`Yes, Sir William?'
`And what is the result? Where went
he?'
`To summon the selectmen!'
`That I know! Where afterwards?'
`To the prison!'
`Did he go in!'
`Yes, Sir William! But he shortly
after came forth again and brought the
prisoner here, as you ordered!'
`As I ordered! What prisoner!'
`Why, I learned from the guard whom
I questioned while he was in, that he had
gone there by an order from you to
escort
the old rebel Colonel to you!'
`This did you hear?'
`Yes, Sir William. And I waited till
Mr. Nelson came out again with the pris
oner; and then I followed him and the
Sergeant and four men at a distance.
`Do you mean to say that a Sergeant
and four men accompanied Neal and the
prisoner from the prison!'
`Yes, Sir William!'
`This is strange and unaccountable!
Where did they go?'
`Have you not seen them!'
`Seen who!'
`The prisoner and Mr. Nelson!'
`No!'
`I followed them hither to
head-quarters
.
Neal left his prisoner and guard at
the front gate and came into the house.
In a few minutes he returned, and I heard
him say that you were engaged in
council
,
and for the present the prisoner must
await your leisure in a rear room of the
house. So he ordered the guard round
to the east door and there they remain
supposing that the prisoner was with you,
as certainly I did, for I saw them ascend
the stairs together, as I supposed to the
ante-room. If I have been in error, Sir,
I could not help it; for I supposed that
you had sent for the prisoner, and that
Mr. Nelson was acting under your
instructions
.
I thought you only wished
me to follow him while he was abroad;
not in your own house!'
Sir William Howe stood a few moments
over-powered with surprise. At length
he said,
`Is the Sergeant at the door?'
`Yes, Sir William!'
`Send him to me!'
From this man the British general
learned the ruse Neal had practiced to
get possession of the prisoner. Instant
search was made throughout the house
and gardens but he could not be
discovered
,
neither he nor the prisoner. Sir
William Howe then gave orders to have
every avenue strictly guarded, and patrols
were sent in every direction to intercept
the fugitives in their escape.
After he had given his orders, and was
pacing up and down the room thinking
upon Neal's defaction, the door opened
and Madame Nelson, his sister, entered
with a face flashed with angry emotion.
`Neal has gone over to the rebels,
brother!'
`I know it!'
`Here is a letter stating his reasons
for doing so! I want you to read it!
Perhaps you will not censure him so
severely
,
when you bear in mind that he is
a native of the country!'
`Ah! are you too, about to prove
disloyal
!'
`No! But Neal's arguments are very
forcible! I never before viewed this
contest
in the light he represents it!'
`Sir William, here is a package for
you!' said a servant entering.
The English general took it and
glancing
at the address, said with angry
susprise
,
`It is the young traitor's hand-writing!
Does he address me too, seeking to make
a rebel of me l'
Without further words his uncle broke
the seal and sat down to peruse the letter
which Neal had left for him. When he
had ended it, he took up that written to
his mother, and read that also to the end!
`Well, the boy is thorough-faced rebel,
bone and blood! The rogue reasons
well, and would I dare say convince any
man but an Englishman that we are
unjust
and tyrannical, and the cause of the
Revolters is a sacred one! There is no
doubt but that he has escaped with
Colonel
Parks to the rebel army! If so, I
am sorry; for I hoped much from him!
But if he attaches himself to this cause
which he loftily styles `his country's,'
he will fall with it, and all his hopes in
life ruined forever! The Colonists,
though we are now somewhat closely
pressed by them, must eventually yield
submmission to the royal arms, and then
infamy will follow all those visionary and
romantic gentlemen who have deserted
the King for the standard of revolt!'
The next day the English general, as
has been already seen, was too much
occupied
with arranging for the secure
retreat
of his garrison to think much of
Neal. His mother, partly influenced by
his arguments, but mainly governed by
materal feelings, resolved to remain
behind
;
which in the confusion of the
evacuation
she was enabled to do without
drawing the attention of her brother to
the fact until he was already embarked
and missed her on board. The
departure
of the fleet for Halifax we have
already
mentioned, with the repossession
of the town by the Patriots. Neal, our
here we have also seen enter riding
among the young officers composing the
staff of Washington. He had been
presented
to Washington in Frederick's
chamber several evening's before, and
when he had reached his quarters with
Colonel Parks, this gentleman so warmly
spoke in his praise, relating his history,
that Washington at once appointed him
to a position near his person, the same
which Frederick had occupied before he
was wounded. In Boston he found his
mother and embraced her with joyful
emotions
.
Having thus brought our hero to
honor
and credit among his own
countrymen
,
and to favor with Washington, we
need not assure the reader that Annie was
become the happiest maiden in all the
land? Her brother was rapidly
convalescing
,
and a warm friendship had sprung
up between him and Neal. He
sanctioned
her heart's choice of the noble
young seaman, and her uncle had given
her his consent to her union with his
young friend so soon as the war should
terminate; `for,' said he, `the camp is
no place for bridals. As there seemed
to be a prospect, from the present aspect
of affairs, that the war would speedily be
brought to an end, the lovers were not
impatient so long as they could see each
other daily; which was the case, as
Colonel
Parks had returned to his mansion
where not only Annie resided, but where
Neal himself was quartered with his friend
Frederick.
The face of things after the entrance
of the American army into Boston began
to wear a different aspect. The ruined
and dismantled houses were repaired;
churches desecrated to riding circuses
for cavalry, and to the uses of barracks
were restored; the town was open to the
country people; and the markets were
once more filled with abundance.
Preparations
were at once made for fortilying
the harbor and making it defensive in
case the enemy should attempt to
reoccupy
the town with a fresh army.
Cannon, muskets and ball were now
plenty among the Amercans, but there
was no powder. If forts were built and
redoubts armed there was no powder to
render them of service in case of an
attack
.
This deficiency so serious was
irremediable
.
There was no manufactory
of gunpowder then established in New
England, and the army was dependant
wholly upon supplies from abroad.
Vessels
disguised under English colors had
been despatched to the coast of Africa to
purchase powder from the British forts
there, but they had not returned; and
there was no visible means of getting a
supply. Up to this time, the Americans
had no navy. They had never thought
of competing on the sea with so
formidable
a power as that of Englandthe
mistress
of the Ocean. Two letters of
Marque, indeed, had been fitted out, one
under the heroic Captain Manly, who,
having captured an English provision
ship and brought her safe into Salem,
won for himself a high reputation; for
it was the first conquest over England
upon the ocean. This success led to the
arming of other private cruisers as well
as an order from the provincial
Congress
to build several thirty-two gun
frigates
.
But at the period of the repossession of
Boston by Washington's army, none of
these frigates had been launched, and all
the armed marine of the country
consisted
in four or five small cruisers to which
letters of Marque had been granted by
Congress. These little vessels were
generally
fast sailers, and manned with very
resolute men. As yet, none of them had
made any captures save Manly's
schooner
.
This was not, however, from want
of zeal or courage, but from the
difficulty
of cutting off any of the English
merchantmen
or transports that were bound
into Boston to Howe's army. They were
daring enough, and often risked capture
by the English frigates through their
boldness. They would secrete
themselves
in the small harbors along the
coast, or in the mouth of the rivers, or
behind some one of numerous islands of
Boston Bay and from these positions dart
out upon the enemy, sometimes running
him fairly into port under the very guns
of Shuldam's ships of war.
The departure of the one hundred and
fifty British transports was a source of
very particular gratification to the
commanders
of these cruisers. They
fore-saw
that many English provision and
powder ships would still make for the
port, ignorant of the departure of the
fleet and garrison; and these they
resolved
to make prizes. Admiral Shuldam
however, was too shrewd a man to leave
such unsuspecting vessels to fall into the
hands of the rebel cruisers that
hawk-like
would be ready to pounce upon them.
He therefore left Commodore Barker
with a small force of one frigate and
three sloops to protect them, and warn
them off the coast.
The American cruisers were not,
however
,
to be intimidated by such
precautions
.
Stretching boldly out to sea in
the night, they run by daylight far
eastward
of the squadron and out of sight of
it, and placing themselves in the track
of vessels bound in lay in wait for them;
John Bull believing he had the rogues
blockaded in shore of him.
Five days after the sailing of the
transports with Sir William Howe's
forces
,
the citizens of Boston were
surprised
and alarmed one morning at dawn by
firing of cannons in the direction of the
harbor. On hastening to their roofs and
look-outs they beheld a large English
ship, the British ensign hoisted
underneath
the stars and stripes, coming in
past the castle a prize to a small
schooner
that was a cable's length in advance.
She proved to be a store-ship bound to
Boston to supply the garrison. The
cruiser had fallen in with her fifty miles
at sea early the evening before and
captured
her; and though discovered by an
English frigate four hours later and
chased by it, she reached port in safety
with her valuable prize. This cvent
gave new impulse to public feeling.
The stores on board the prize were very
much needed, but there was
no
powder,
the article most in requisition.
`If one hundred of those barrels had
been filled with gun-powder instead of
flour,' said General Washington, `it
would have been more valuable than
gold dust. The captain of the cruiser
that should capture a powder ship
deserves
a frigate!'
This speech did not fall unheeded
upon
the ears of Neal Nelson who was
present
and heard it. He had an hour
before
been insulted by Frederick Parks;
and but for his love for Anne he would
have resented it at once. But this
restrained
him; and he had sought the
presence of Washington to desire to be
sent on some duty of danger and
importance
,
that he might show that the
charge which Frederick rashly fastened
upon him was false. Anne, young and
beautiful, had more admirers than our
hero. In the American army were
several
young men who admired her and
sought her society. They were not long
in discovering that Neal was the
monopolizer
of all her smiles. Jealousy was
awakened, and envy aroused. This led
to an investigation of his claims and
then whispered doubts as to the
sincerity
of his attachment to the American
cause. `Spy of Howe!' dropped from
more than one young man's lips. The
ears of Frederic were poisoned, and
though at first he warmly took the part
of his friend, he was finally led to doubt
his good father. He went to him,
frankly
told him the suspicions he entertained
of him.
With the resolution that he would
perform
some act that should forever silence
calumnies that he knew originated in
jealousy, he sought the presence of the
Commander-in-Chief. He waited until
Washington was alone, and then said,
firmly and respectfully,
`Sir, yon have kindly placed
confidence
in me, and stationed me near your
person, though I so lately formed a
portion
of the military household of the
English
general. Your favor towards me
and some other light causes, have drawn
upon me the dislike of some of the young
officers. I am accused of being a spy
of Sir William Howe! Will you, sir,
confide to me some duty of danger and
necessity whereby my conduct I may
silence
my calumniators.'
`What service would you like?' asked
Washington after questioning him more
closely and in a friendly manner as to
the difference between him and the other
young officers.
`I am a sailor, I would like to cruise
in search of a powder-ship! your
excellency
!
There are two to be destined
for this port. The cruiser that captured
that English ship is about to sail
to-morrow
.
The second officer in command
is wounded and the place is vacant. Your
interest will obtain it for me!'
`You shall have it,' answered
Washington
very positively.
CHAPTER IX.
THE REBEL CRUISER.
It
was twilight of the day on which
our hero had received the promise of
Genera. Washington that he would use
his influence to get him appointed to the
second station in the cruiser schooner.
`The Rebel' which had brought the
English
store-ship in as a prize.
Washington
had redeemed his pledge and sent
him the commission. As soon as he had
received it, he first hastened to return him
his grateful thanks for this mark of his
confidence in him, and then flew to take
a farewell of Anne; for that night with
the tide the schooner was to sail.
It was twilight and the lovers stood
together
in the door of the mansion.
`It is not necessary you should take
this course, Neal, to maintain your
honor
,'
said Anne, sadly. `I have talked
with my brother and he is now ready to
apologise to you. He is persuaded that
he was misled; and he regrets deeply that
he should have forgotten so soon all your
kindess to him and uncle! He will soon
be at home; and I entreat you will wait
and be reconciled to him?'
`I would gladly be so! I have no
animosity
towards Frederick! I am glad
he expresses confidence in me! But the
whisper has gone abroad! It is on many
lips. I must give evidence by my acts
that I am no spybut a true patriot
though a late one! I cannot delay! I
have here the commission! The cruiser
weighs in an hour, and I burn to do
something to distinguish myself and to
silence calumny.'
`How happy I am that General
Washington's
faith in you remains firm! How
noble in him to trust you when such
reports
were flying abroad!'
`Circumstances look strong against
me! The fact that I am the nephew of
General Howe, and have been his aid
and an officer also in the King's service,
these facts are sufficient to lead persons
to believe such reports easily. None
know, as you do, Anne, the peculiar
motives
which actuated me;' he said,
looking
upon her and smiling. `None know
the arguments by which I was converted.
Men only see the external act! They
look upon it, naturally, with suspicion!
They readily believe I may be a spy!
But I hope to prove that I am true to the
cause I have embraced! I have certain
knowledge that two powder-ships,
containing
of course other stores besides
arms, are on their way from Portsmouth
to Boston. It is for the protection of
these ships when they come on the
coast that Admiral Shuldam has left the
squadron under Commodore Bankes:
for he well knew the value they would
be to his foe, should they or one of them
fall into his hands. Now it is my hope
to fall in with and capture one of these
ships. No service that could be
performed
would be so highly estimated by
Washington or the country as such a
capture. When I heard Washington
this morning so warmly express his wish
that the prize had contained powder, I
internally resolved that I would embark,
even as a common seaman, in `The
Rebel'
and endeavor to be at least one of
the party that should bring such a prize
into port. But I hold the rank of second
in command, and this will give me an
opportunity of winning fame and name!
for I am resolved that if I can have any
influence with my voice, that the cruiser
shall not return to port without one or the
other of these ships.'
In a few minutes afterwards, while
they were still lingering at their parting,
the signal gun sounded from the port.
Neal once more embraced the weeping
girl and hastened to the pier. The last
boat was just leaving it. He sprung on
board and in five minutes stood upon the
deck of the little vessel. There was
just light enough for him to distinguish
the captain, whom he recognized by his
chapeau and sword, not having yet seen
him.
`This is Captain Derby, I believe,'
said Neal, walking aft from the gangway
`Yes, sir,' answered a short, full-faced
man, thirty-five years of age, with a keen
look, and a very firm, but pleasing
expression
of countenance.
`Yes: is this Mr. Nelson?'
Neal replied in the affirmative.
`I am glad to see you ou board, sir, as
the tide will soon serve. `I am prepared
to find in you a good officer. The
general
has spoken to me favorably of you.'
Neal bowed, and then said, `I will, if
you please, assume my duties.'
`Yes. Take the deck while I go
below
to finish a letter I have to send on
shore!' and he handed him the trumpet.
Neal, prepossessed in favor of his
captain
,
began to take upon himself the
command
of the deck by giving two or three
neaessary orders in a tone that at once
showed the men they had a seaman to
command them who must be obeyed.
At eight o'clock the schooner loosed
her fore-topsail and jib, and tripping her
anchor, was in five minutes afterwards
bowling down the harbor at the rate of
seven knots. The night was starry with
drifting clouds; the wind steady from
N.N. West. The schooner was about one
hundred tons burthen, a very fast sailer,
with unusual breadth of beam. She
carried
eight `twelves' and one twenty-four
on a carriage upon a sort of top-gallant
fore-castle which seemed to have been
constructed on purpose to sustain the
gun at this elevation. The crew
consisted
of sixty men.
All these facts Neal learned befor they
had passed the castle. Up to this time
Captain Derby had taken no active part
in the command, although he had been
on deck since the anchor was weighed.
He seemed to leave all to his new officer
that he might test his quallties as an
officer
and as a seaman.
After they had passed Nix Mate and
left the Light house a mile or two astern,
Captain Derby approached Neal as he
stood near the helmsman conning the
sailing of the vessel.
`Well, Mr. Nelson, I am very well,
satisfied with General Washington's
appointment
!
I see you understand your
business. I dont want a better officer if
you turn out to be as good as you've
begun
.'
`I am gratified at your approval, sir,'
answered Neal.
`Now, we are in blue water we have
got to keep a sharp look out. Bankes
is cruising in our present neighborhood,
and can't be far off at this moment; for
he was in the offing at sunset with the
frigate that chased me in, and a sloop.
We must take in all the sail we can spare
so as not to be conspicuous if they sweep
the sea with their night glasses; at the
same time we must carry enough to get
off the coast before daylight and far
outside
of him.'
`Have you any particular object in
view this cruise, sir?'
`Particular! Yes, very particular.
I mean to capture the first British
vessel
that will strike to me.'
`I mean is there any vessel in
particular
that you are desirous of capturing?'
`No! I shall watch for any that are
bound this way.'
`Would you not like to fall in with a
ship laden with powder, Captain Derby?'
`I would rather make such a capture
than capture a frigate if she had no
powder
on board!'
`You, perhaps, know that though I am
now in the Provincial service, I was
recently
in the British!'
`Yes, the general told me part of your
story; but old Colonel Parks sent for me
and gave me a full account of you!'
`Then I have only to add that I
learned
while I was in the king's service that
two ships laden with powder and
munitions
of war were to sail from Bristol or
Portsmouth the last of February! It is
now the twenty eighth of March!'
`Do you mean to say that the ships
were destined for Boston?'
`Yes; to supply Sir William Howe's
army! It is more paricularly to watch
for the approach of these two ships that
Commodore Bankes has been left to
cruise off the port.'
`This is brave news! Last of last
month they were to sail! They have
been to sea now thirty days or so!
Excellent
news! Now if I could fall in
with one of these powder-monkies I
would tie his tail to my taffrail and tow
him in to Boston!'
`It is with the prospect of your being
able to make a capture of one of these
vessels I have shipped with you; for I
would share in the credit of the
enterprize
!'
`I would never ask another earthly
favor
if I might come athwart one of these
gentlemen!' said Captain Derby with
animation
walking up and down the deck
and rubbing his hands! `Boys!' he
suddenly cried out to his men! `There
are two powder-ships making for Boston,
thirty days out! We will have them if
we have to fight Banke's squadron!
Hey, boys?'
`Aye, aye, sir!' was the general re
`Keep a good lookout there, bows?
Open your eyes there in the fore-topmast
head! You have got to see double and
lookout for prizes as well as John Bull's
frigates! Have the men all ready at their
guns, Mr. Nelson! These store ships
show fight sometimes and have to be
whipped! The prize we took yesterday
give us nine round shot besides a
sprinkling
of musketry. Harry Cowell my
second
,
and three men got hit! We must
be prepared for the rogues!'
The little vessel ploughed her way
along over the undulating billows, under
shortened sail to present as little surface
to the eyes of the enemy as possible, and
yet making full six knots. Her course
was E. S. East, wing and wing, the wind
being dead aft. At least a dozen men
were engaged in looking out from the
deck and aloft, some directing their eyes
abeam, and others astern; for Captain
Derby knew that ships which had kept
no lookout over the course they had
crossed, bad sometimes found themselves
over-hauled by the enemy coming up
under
their stern.
It was about five minutes after seven
bells had struck in the middle watch,
when. Neal who was pacing the deck
suddenly
stopped. He had been walking and
thinking upon Anne and anticipating the
time when, if fortune favored him, he
should return with honor and silence
forever
all doubts of the sincerity of
allegiance
to the patriot cause. At intervals,
mindful of his duty, he had sent his keen
glance ahead and around him; and at the
moment he stopped, his eye was arrested
by a star rising, but which he believed at
first to be the light of a vessel it was
visible
so low upon the horizon. Taking
his glass he examined it and was satisfied
that it was the star Aldeharan. He put
down his glass and remained watching
its slow altitude when he saw it all at once
disappear and the next instant re-appear
as if an opaque object had passed between
it and his line of sight. The idea that
it was a vessel flashed upon his mind; and
again seizing his glass, he levelled it in
the direction, and was satisfied that there
was a ship ahead about three points off
the starboard bow and standing close
hauled, but on what tack he was unable
to determine, the whole mass was so
indistinct
Captain Derby was lying asleep
upon the deck with his jacket under his
head for a pillow; for he was too anxious
to go below. Neal awoke him and
directed
his attention to the sail.
`It is a large ship, and I think
standing
upon the larboard tack S. by East!
She is one of Banke's frigates. Give the
word quietly Mr. Nelson, to haul aft the
fore and main sheets, and let us steer a
point or two nigher till we can better
make her out. Drop both the peaks, and
take a double reef in the fore-sail and
mainsail, so that we can lay as low in the
water as possible. All our top canvass
is furled as it should be in such a
dangerous
neighborhood!'
These orders were conveyed to the men
by Nelson in an under tone, for the wind
blew directly towards the stranger, and it
was important that no sound should be
borne to them: for at sea the slightest
noise is heard at an inconceivable
distance
.
`We can run down close under her
counter with the low sail we carry,' said
Neal; and can see what she looks like,
We shall not be discovered if we let go
our halyards as we come close to her.'
`You are both bold and wise I see, Mr.
Nelson. I love a brave man! Take the
command as it is your watch, and
manage
her as you will! I will play
passenger
and look on! It is my opinion it is
the frigate.'
`No, sir,' responded Neal who had the
glass at his eye; `she is too small for a
frigate! It is either one of the sloops or
a large merchantman.'
`Then it is one of the store-ships.'
`I sincerely hope so. We shall
however
soon know, as we are now not more
than a mile from her.'
The schooner with not a yard of
canvass
hoisted twenty feet above her decks,
lying low and crouching upon the water
like a hound upon its haunches, moved
steadily and silently down towards the
dark tower of canvass that lay between
her and the sky. As they came nearer,
it was plain that the ship was beating
westward on the larboard tack, with
top-gallant-sails
set, and royal-yards across.
`Whether she is an armed vessel or
not, I be hanged if I can make out,' said
Captain Derby. `But she looks to me
like a merchant ship! Hark there is eight
bells! Now listen.'
The loud prolonged call of the `
larboard
watch ahoy!' reached their ears.
`That settles it, sir,' said Neal with
animation.
`Yes, I think it does,' answered the
Captain. `A man of war never calls a
watch in that style.'
`No. She is a trader.'
`I hope she is a store-ship filled with
powder.'
`That remains to be seen! But look
to leeward of her! There is another
ship booming up against the sky like a
cloud! We are in ticklish company! It
can't be that they are both the
powder-ships
.'
`I think the one the other side of her
must be one of Banke's frigates,' said
Neal levelling his glass at the new-comer.
`Hark! there is a boatswain's whistle!
See! a linstock is flashing on her decks!
Let go halyards there that the flash of
the gun if they fire shall not expose us!
Easywithout noise!'
Hardly had the sails descended to the
deck ere a bright flash illumined the sea.
By it, the ship first discoverved, was
plainly seen to be a large store-ship,
painted black with white bends. It also
displayed the vessel from which it came.
She was plainly made out to be a frigate
of the first class. A loud report
resounded
across the water and died away in the
distance.'
`That gun is for the ship to heave to,
not for us,' said Neal. `Hark! hear
the yards swing round! She is laying
her maintopsail aback! Listen! They
hail her from the frigate's deck.'
`Ship, ahoy! what ship is that?'
`The George the IIIdstore-ship!
bound to Boston!'
`Aye, aye! Glad to fall in with you!
Have spoken your consort six hours ago
and ordered her to put away for Halifax!
The garrison is withdrawn from Boston,
and the Yankees are in possession again!
Happy to fall in with you, Captain! Fill
away and lay your course for Halifax!'
`Aye, aye, sir! What frigate is that?'
`His Brittanic majesty's frigate the
Sphynx.'
`Thank you, sir, for your warning!'
`Keep in my wake till day-light, and
will protect you till you get a hundred
miles or so Eastward! There are some
rebel cruisers abroad and they
are in want of powder. So you must
keep sharp look out.'
`Aye, aye, sir! But we are a heavy
sailer and may fall astern!'
`Fill away with me and steer E. N.
East, and if you lose sight of me you will
be sure I am ahead. If I lose sight of
you for any length of time I will lay by
and wait till you come up.'
`Thank you, sir.'
`The order `brace round the yards,'
then reached the ears of Neal and
Captain
Derby from the powder-ship, and the
frigate putting up her helm took the lead
followed by the other.
`Now, if I do not hang upon your
track like a blood hound,' said Neal
within himself, `I hope never to see
Anne! Captain Derby that ship must
be our prize before another hour
`Impossible'
`It is possible, sir!'
`She is under the protection of the
frigate!'
`Therefore can we take her easier.
She will feel the more secure.'
`How can it be effected?'
`It is plain, though we have been
within
hail, we have not been discovered.
That frigate therefore cannot see us a
mile distant is very plain. This
store-ship
is a bad sailer, so says her captain!
She is now a third of a mile at the start
astern of her convoy, and in half an hour
will be likely to double this space. My
plan is, sir, to follow close in her wake
and when we get near enough, hail her,
and demand to know if she is the
store-ship
`George the IIId!' On receiving
a reply, we will inform them of the
evacuation of Boston, and warn them not
to proceed, passing ourselves off as one
of Banke's cruisers! Our gratuitive
information
will gain their confidence and
I will gradually fall along side. If you
will have the boarders ready to leap away
at the word, in three minutes she will be
in our hands! All we shall then have
to do will be to stick her head on the
other tack and beat dead to windward.
It will be some time, perhaps an hour or
two, before the frigate wlll miss her
altogether
and put back to look her up. By
that time we shall have so far got the
weather gage as to laugh at the
Commodore
should he be in sight at day-break!'
`Mr. Nelson' said Captain Derby
grasping his hand, `you have my hearty
concurrence in this plan. It is well
conceived
.
It does you honor. You shall
have the credit of carrying it out.'
The schooner was the next moment
under press of sail steering in the wake
of the store-ship, which was now distant
about half a mile ahead.
CHAPTER X.
THE POWDER-SHIP.
The
attempt about to be made for
cutting
off the powder-ship from the
protection
of the frigate, was one of singular
boldness and temerity. But our hero
was well fitted for an enterprize like this.
Brave and skilful, and as cool as he was
courageous, he knew no difficulties where
he resolved to succeed. Captain Derby
was scarcely less daring in spirit and
action
than himself; and his crew were full
of animation and zeal. The most
perfect
silence, consistent with the
working
of the vessel, prevailed on board; and
all were in eager expectation. Groups of
men crowded the fore-castle intently
watching the two vessels ahead, for not
only the store-ship was in sight, but also
the dark cloud like outline of the frigate
in the distance beyond her. The
schooner's
sheets were drawn aft nearly sharp,
though the wind was several points free,
in order to present as narrow a surface as
possible to the eyes of those on the deck
of the enemy; while their broad yards
presented a large object to the vision of
their pursuers.
`How does she go?' asked Captain
Derby, as Neal laid down the thirty
second
glass after ordering the reel to be
held.
`Five and a half!'
`That is fair! We plainly gain upon
them!'
`Yes. After we get a cable's length
nigher they will of course discover us;
run boldly up along side and hail; for if
they see us lagging behind they will take
the alarm and perhaps fire a gun to
attract
the attention of the frigate!'
`You are right, Mr. Nelson! Steady,
as you are, helmsman!'
`Steady, sir!' answered the man in
the low, gruff tone, peculiar to men
when at the helm.
`She booms up bravely! There is a
light moving on board!' said Captain
Derby! `Stand up at your guns, men,
for we must be ready for any emergency.'
`Let every man have his boarding pike
and cutlass ready to his grasp,' said Neal a
few moments afterwards. `Be silent in
treading about the decks. Be ready to
board when you shall see me spring into
the hammock netting's and call
boarders
away! But let there be no pistols
fired or taken; for this ship must be
carried
with as little noise as possible! We
must get possession of her before she can
have time to fire a gun or give any alarm.'
The schooner stood on about five
minutes
longer, when Neal, for Captain
Derby
had given the whole conduct of the
enterprise to him as its originator, gave
an order to ease off the fore and main
sheets and keep away a couple of points!
The long booms moved out broadly
over the bulwarks and the little vessel
freed from her temporary restraint went
dashing forward boldly in a direction
and at a rate that in ten minutes brought
her within hail under the lee-counter of
the ship. She was already discovered
by the sound of commotion which the
wind bore to their ears; but Neal
without
giving them time to speculate upon
his character or to hail him first, seized
his trumpet, and waiting until the
schooner
came so near that his voice could not
be heard by the frigate, he hailed in true
man-of-war style,
`What ship is that?'
`The George III store-ship bound to
Boston? What schooner is that?'
`His Brittania majesty's cruiser,'
Bull Dog.
`From your course I suppose you are
bound into Halifax, and have heard of
the evacuation of Boston?'
`Yes.'
`What ship is that ahead?'
`His majesty's frigate the Sphynx!'
the fleet cruising about here to warn
vessels
off! (Helmsman, luff a point! Come
up directly abeam so as to run the end of
the jib-boom into her fore-rigging. Stand
by her in tbe quarter boat with the
grapnals
and be ready to cast them into her
mizzen-chains at the word!'
These
orders
were spoken by Neal in an under
tone.)
You are under convoy of the
frigate
,
I suppose!'
`Yes.'
`Very well, then I will not keep
company
with you! Good night and a
pleasant
passage!'
`Thank you, sir, good night!'
The two vessels were standing on their
course all the while, the ship under top
gallant sails her courses brailed up, the
schooner under her fore and main sail
and her jib and fore topsail. They were
moving at about the rate of seven to five!
so that the schooner was each instant
overlapping the Ship's quarter with her
bows. The space between the vessels
abeam was about one hundred feet.
`I will pass ahead of you and speak the
frigate,' said Neal. `You seem to be a
light sailer and could make a circle
round me if you chose,' answered the
English Captain.
`Have you any late London papers?'
`Yes; I will throw you one, if you
will luff a little closer.'
Neal heard the captain give an order
to his steward to go into the cabin to
being the newspapers.
`Now stand by, boarders, all!
Captain
Derby you may head the party bows
or astern! I do not wish to rob you of
any honor in this affair!'
`I am too fat to do service leading
boarders! I will remain and look after
the schooner, for you may have to
retreat
aboard again!'
`Not while I have a life to lose!
Helmsman now is your time to shoot the
jib-boom in her fore-rigging!'
`Tell your men to keep away a little
sir, you will be afoul of us!' cried the
English captain with quick apprehension.
Before he had done speaking the
jib-boom
of the schooner showed itself
between the rattlings of the fore rigging
and the same instant the stern swung
towards
the ship's quarter!
`Cast your grapnels!' cried Neal.
`Now, boarders, away! Captain!' he
cried to the English commander, `I will
come on board in person and take your
papers!'
The next instant he was upon the deck
of the ship with thirty men at his back.
The struggle was short. Taken by
surprise
,
the English Captain made but little
resistance, and fled to his cabin. Two
British Colonels and three or four young
military officers, who were passengers
going over to join Howe's army, made a
courageous defence and were finally only
secured after they had killed three of the
boarders and wounded Neal in the
sword-arm
.
As they had not anticipated a
surprise
there was fortunately no pistols on
deck, and none were discharged in the
melee. The crew of the ship, driven to
the forecastle, made no resistance but
surrendered at discretion. In four
minutes
after Neal had boarded, the ship was
in his possession, and the captain and
eighteen seamen besides the military
officers
,
prisoners.
So complete had been the surprise,
and so successful the capture, that the
vessel still continued on her course, Neal
having the first thing sent a man to take
the helm which the English sailor had
deserted. The ship proved to be armed
with four twelve pounders; but they were
unloaded; and although a circlet of
boarding pikes surrounded the main-mast,
not one of them had been removed from
the beckets.
`I regret, my dear sir, I should have
to take you into Boston after all,' said
Neal to the discomfited British captain;
`but as that is the port for which you
sailed, it will not be any infringement
upon your ship's papers!'
`I would like to know if you are a
Yankee cruiser?' asked the Captain,
whom Neal had invited on deck.
`Yes. This is the American schooner
Rebel, Captain Derby, along side; and
we left Boston not many hours since on
purpose to capture you or the William
and Mary. But as she has been manned
and is making the best of her way to
Halifax
,
I must be content with George
IIId. How much powder have you on
board?'
`You will find out before you get into
port. I will blow you sky-high if, I can
get a match.'
`You are very kind to inform me of
your intentions! I will have you put in
irons. A guard is already placed over
the magazine's hold! So don't think of
doing anything so rash, dear captain. It
is very natural that you should fume and
swear a little, for it must be provoking
to be captured right under the stern of a
frigate!'
`None but a madman would have
attempted
it! The frigate is not three
quarters of a mile off! I wish I had a
pistol or musket for a moment to fire and
let 'em know what a fix we are in. You
keep standing on; do you mean to take
the frigate too?'
`Not quite; I stand on to lull any
suspicions
that any noise, if heard, might
have roused. If they heard our boarding
you, and seeing the ship still sailing
steadily
in her wake, she will not stop to
inquire
what was the matter; but if I had
instantly put about, as I mean to do in a
few moments, she would be putting back
to look after us.'
You are confoundedly shrewd. So I
suppose if the frigate dont happen to look
back, I shall have to go into Boston.'
`Yes. The Americans are in great
want of gun-powder, and this supply you
have brought over is very seasonable.
No doubt the city of Boston will present
you with a vote of thanks.'
`You are a very merry young
gentleman
.'
`Captain Derby,' said Neal, looking
over the side, `now you have cast off the
schooner, perhaps you had best drop
astern, and lay your course to windward.
As the frigate may see you when you
quit the ship's side, you had best stand
away in such a line that the prize will
cover you till you get out of sight. I
shall gradually shorten sail and fall astern
till I lose sight of the frigate, and then
follow you.'
Captain Derby followed successfully
the suggestions of his young officer, and
dropping astern, leaving thirty of the
cruiser's crew in the prize with Neal, he
was in ten minutes invisible in the gloom
of the midnight sea.
The frigate was now about a mile ahead
standing on her course totally
unsuspicious
of the events that had transpired on
board the powder-ship in convoy. Neal
had thought he could safely drop astern,
and gave orders to furl the main and
mizzin
top-gallant sails. Soon afterwards he
brailed up the mizzen and main topsail,
leaving the head sails standing as they
were so as to deceive the frigate and give
the appearance of being under full sail.
`Is there no way in which we can give
the frigate intimation of our situation?'
asked one of the British colonels of the
captain in an under tone.
`None unless by discharging fire arms!
The report of a pistol would attract her
attention and bring her to! But we are
so closely guarded by the Yankee, there
is no access to such a weapon! We must
take it philosophically, trusting that the
frigate will miss us and put back after us;
for you see we are falling astern fast
under
our short sail, and in ten minutes we
shall have lost sight of her!'
`This capture is characteristic of all
that I have heard of those rebellious
yankees
.
They are bold, daring devils and
attempt to achieve enterprizes no other
people would think of! Who would have
thought of or dared to board a ship within
less than a mile of a frigate, when the
firing of a single pistol would have
betrayed
them and brought the frigate down
upon them.'
`Not exactly
down
upon them, Colonel,'
responded the Captain; `for the frigate is
ahead of us and of course to leeward.
She would have to beat up to us, and it
would have been a long chase. This the
yankee knows and calculated upon. The
fact is, we are fairly outwitted and must
content ourselves with going into Boston
prisoners. See, the frigate is scarcely
visible. You can scarcely make her out.
She gradually fades away in the darkness
and distance, and now she is fairly out of
sight.'
`Ready about!' cried Neal in a quick
exulting tone.
`You see that the young fellow knows
what he is about!' continued the Captain.
`He will have it all his own way now.
The frigate keeps on as ignorant of our
being in the hands of the enemy as a Port
Admiral parading Portsmouth Pier that
his flashy pocket handkerchief has been
picked out of his pocket.'
The order given by the young seaman
was obeyed by his crew with alacrity.
They had discovered before Neal had
been an hour in the schooner that they
had a second officer who knew his
business
;
and his success had now bound
them to him with a devotion nothing could
destroy. He had not merely shown
himself
a seaman, but a brave man who could
handle a cutlass as well as a trumpet. He
had conquered for them a ship of
inestimable
value, enriching with her wealth,
each man of them all. They sprung to
their ports with a glad cry as they heard
the order to put about, and with a hearty
heave-ho-yeo that even the vicinity of the
frigate could not check they swung the
yards around and brought the ship braced
sharp up on the larboard tack.
`Lay aloft and make sail!' cried Neal
as the ship met her helm and lay snugly
to the wind.
The mizzin and main topmast were
loosed and the top-gallant sails set again,
and the ship began to toss the sea from
under her bows, leaving the frigate
rapidly
in the distance.
`Keep a good lookout forward there,
and aloft, for we are not yet safe in port,'
cried Neal to his men. `There is another
frigate and three eighteen gun sloops yet
cruising about us. We are besides twenty
leagues east of our port with a wind dead
in our teeth.'
The prize proved, indeed, a very heavy
sailor. With a breeze that eight knots
could have been freely got out of the
schooner, but five and a half could be
made by the ship. After standing on about
an hour, a sail was discovered ahead.
Neal had his men called to quarters and
stood on till he was satisfied that it was
the schooner on the opposite tack. They
hailed as they passed, and Captain Derby
saying he would keep in company, fell
astern and followed in her wake under
shortened sail. In less than twenty
minutes
afterwards the cry sail ho, was
again heard from aloft. Neal sprung
forward and saw that a large ship was
very near, crossing his fore-foot. He
knew that if she was a frigate, he could
not escape her, and so resolved to put
the best face on the matter, luffed to give
her room to pass.
`What ship is that?' came hoarsely
from the deck of the stranger, which he
now saw plainly was a sloop of war.
`The George IIId, store ship, bound
for Boston!' answered Neal.
`Then tack ship and lay your course
for Halifax! The port of Boston has
been deserted by his majesty's fleet and
garrison, and is in Washington's hands.
Lay your course for the port of Halifax.'
`Aye, aye, sir! Many thanks for your
kindness.'
`What schooner is that in company?'
`A New foundland fishing-schooner we
have just spoken.'
The ships parted. The sloop of war
was soon lost in the darkness, and the
prize kept boldly on her way, crowding
all sail to get as far to windward as
possible
.
The day light dawned upon the prize
ship and cruiser within sight of Cape Cod,
the Sphynx frigate hull down to the East,
her topsails just dipping, and evidently in
pursuit of the store ship. The prize,
however, safely reached port about four
o'clock in the afternoon, and with `The
Rebel' in company, saluted the town
with thirteen guns and anchored of the
end of Long Wharf abreast of the other
prize.
The joy this capture produced
throughout
the army, the town, and all New
England, cannot be concieved of at this
period of time! The prize contained
eleven hundred casks of powder, besides
cast shot, lead, muskets, swords, pistols,
and provisions to a large amount.
Captain
Derby generously waived all the
credit of the capture, and Neal received
the public congratulations, not only of
Washington and the selectmen of the
town but a vote of thanks from Congress.
The command of the first frigate that
should be ready for sea was conferred
upon him. He silenced completely the
calumnies that had been circulated
againt him; and even his enemies were
constrained to do him reverence. The
joy of Anne can be better imagined than
discribed. Colonel Parks embraced his
young friend with fatherly pride and
affection
,
and said it would be the happiest
day of his life when he should see him
united to Anne. Frederick cordialy
acknowledged
the injustice he had done
him, and the two friends reconciled, were
in a few days more closely bound to each
other as brothers, for Anne and Neal
were united on the fourth of July, ten
weeks after the departure of the English
garrison, at the altar of Christ's Church,
Salem street, Washington giving away
the bride.
Thus we terminate our story; which
we have written mainly to illustrate the
important historical events connected
with the siege and evacuation of Boston;
knowing, that history reflected from the
mirror of romance, sometimes catcheswith
its lusture the youthful eye, which
otherwise
would but faintly be impressed by
its sober presence; and in making use of
history, to further our purpose, we have in
no instance deviated from its integrity.
THE END.`Near the Camp at Cambridge
;
March, 6.
Sir
:
A commander-in-chief cannot be too
cautious whom he employs about his
person
and makes confidants of his plans and
purposes; especially in the position you
are in, surrounded by enemies whom you
have no means of knowing are other than
they seem. The writer need not apprize
you that the romantic notions of liberty
and independence have seized upon the
minds of more than one youth in the
British army and that they have become
disloyal to their king and taken arms with
the rebels! It will not therefore so much
surprise you to learn the disaffection and
disloyalty of one near your own person
and related to you by ties of
consanquinity
.
I allude to Neal Nelson, against
whom I deem it my duty to put you on
your guard. I recommend to you to
observe
closely his conduct, and watch him
when he absents himself from head
quarters
.
It is easy for a traitor who has the
pass word to go out and in the city at
will. A word to the wise is enough; and
General Howe is known not to be
wanting
in wisdom.'
