LETTER I.
HARRINGTON to WORTHY.
BOSTON.
You
may now felicitate me
I have had an interview with the charmer I
informed you of. Alas! where were the
thoughtfulness
and
circumspection
of my
friend
Worthy?
I did not
possess
them, and
am
graceless
enough to acknowledge it.
He would have
considered
the
consequences
,
before he had
resolved
upon the
project
.
But you call me, with
some
degree of
truth, a
strange
medley of contradiction
the
moralist
and the
amoroso
the
sentiment
and the
sensibility
are interwoven in
my
constitution
,
so
that nature and grace
are at continual
fisticuffs
.To the
point:
I PURSUED my determination of
discovering
the dwelling of my charmer, and
have at length obtained
access
. You may
behold my
Rosebud
, but
should
you
presume
to place it in your
bosom
, expect
the force of my wrath to be the infallible
consequence
.
I DECLARED the
sincerity
of my
passion
the
warmth of my affectionto the
beautiful
Harriot
Believe me,
Jack
,
she
did not
seem
inattentive. Her mein is
elegant
her
disposition
inclining to the
melancholy
,
and yet her temper is affable, and
her manners
easy
. And as I poured my
tender vows into the heart of my beloved,
a
crimson
drop
stole
across
her cheek, and
thus I
construe
it in my own favour, as the
sweet
messenger
of hope:
DO not wholly
despair
, my new friend;
excuse
the declaration of a poor
artless
female
you
see
I am not perfectly contented
in my
situation
[
Observe
,
Jack
, I have
not the vanity to think this
distress
altogether
upon my account]Time therefore may
disclose
wonders, and perhaps more to your
advantage than you imaginedo not
despair
then.
SUCH vulgar, uncongenial
souls
, as that
which animates thy clay cold
carcase
, would
have thought this
crimson
drop nothing
more than an ordinary
blush
! Be far
removed
from my heart,
such
sordid
,
uch">such
sordid
,
earthborn
ideas: But come thou
spirit
of
celestial
language, that
canst
communicate by
one affectionate lookone tender glance
more divine information to the
soul
of
sensibility
,
than can be contained in myriads of
volumes!
HAIL gentle God of Love! While thou
rivetest
the chains of thy
slaves
, how
dost
thou make them leap for joy, as with
delicious
triumph
. Happy
enthusiasm
! that
while it carries us away into captivity, can
make the heart to dance as in the
bosom
of
content. Hail gentle God of Love!
Encircled
as thou art with darts, torments, and
ensigns
of cruelty,
still
do we hail thee.
How
dost
thou
smooth
over the
roughness
and
asperities
of
present
pain, with what
thou
seest
in
reversion
! Thou
banishest
the
Stygian
glooms of
disquiet
and
suspense
, by
the hope of approaching
Elysium
Blessed
infatuation!
I DESIRE you will not
hesitate
to
pronounce
an
amen
to my Hymn to Love, as
an unequivocal evidence of your
wish
for
my
success
.
LETTER II.
WORTHY to HARRINGTON.
NEWYORK.
Wish
you
success
!In
what? Who is this lady of whom you have
been talking at
such
an
inconsistent
rate?
But before you have
leisure
to reply to
these
inquiries, you may have forgotten there is
such
a
person
, as
she
whom you call
Harriot
I
have
seen
many juvenile heroes,
during my pilgrimage of two and twenty
years,
easily
inflamed with new objects
agitated and hurried away by the
impetuosity
of new
desires
and at the
same
time
they were by no means famous for
solidity
of judgment, or remarkable for the
permanency
of their
resolutions
. There is
such
B
a tumult
such
an ebullition of the brain in
these
paroxisms
of
passion
, that this new
object is very
superficially
examined.
These
,
added to partiality and
prepossession
, never
fail to blind the eyes of the lover.
Instead
of weighing matters maturely, and
stating
the evidence fairly on both
sides
, in order to
form a right judgment, every
circumstance
not perfectly coincident with your
particular
bias, comes not under
consideration
,
because
it does not flatter your vanity.
Ponder
and
pause
just
here, and tell me
feriously
whether you are in love, and whether
you have
sufficiently
examined your heart
to give a
just
answer
.
Do you mean to
insinuate
that your
declaration
of love hath attracted the affection
of the
pensive
Harriot?
If this
should
be
the
case
, I
wish
you would tell me what you
design
to do with her.
LETTER III.
HARRINGTON to WORTHY.
BOSTON.
I CANNOT but laugh at your
dull fermons, and yet I find
something
in
them not altogether
displeasing
; for this
reason
I permit you to prate on. Weigh
matters maturely! Ha! ha! why art thou
not arrayed in canonicals! What do I
design
to do with her? Upon my word, my
sententious
friend, you
ask
mighty odd
questions
. I
see
you aim a
stroke
at the
foundation upon which the pillar of my
new
system
is rearedand will you
strive
to batter down that pillar? If you entertain
any idea of executing
such
a
task
, I forefee
it will never
succeed
, and
advise
you timely
to
desist
. What!
dost
thou think to topple
down my
scheme
of
pleasure
? Thou
mightest
as well topple down the pike of
Teneriffe
.
I SUPPOSE you will be ready to
ask
, why,
if I love
Harriot
, I do not marry her
Your monitorial
correspondence
has
so
accustomed
me to reproof, that I
easily
anticipate
this piece of impertinenceBut
who
shall
I marry? That is the
question
.
Harriot
has no fatherno motherneither is
there aunt,
cousin
, or kindred of any
degree
who claim any kind of
relationship
to
her. She is companion to Mrs.
Francis
,
and, as I
understand
, totally dependent on
that lady. Now, Mr.
Worthy
, I
must
take
the liberty to acquaint you, that I am not
so
much of a republican as formally to
wed any
person
of this
class
. How
laughable
would my conduct appear, were I to
trace over the
same
ground marked out by
thy immaculate
footsteps
To be heard
openly acknowledging
for my
bosom
companion
,
any daughter of the democratick
empire of virtue!
To
suppose
a
smart
, beautiful girl, would
continue as a companion to the
best
lady in
Christendom
, when
she
could
raise
herself
to
a more eligible
situation
, is to
suppose
a
folecism
She
might as well be immured in
a nunnery. Now,
Jack
, I will
shew
you
B 2
my benevolent
scheme
; it is to take this
beautiful
sprig
, and
transplant
it to a more
favourable foil, where it
shall
flourish
and
blossom
under my own
auspices
. In a word,
I mean to remove this fine girl into an
elegant
apartment, of which
she
herself
is to be
the fole
mistress
. Is not this a proof of my
humanity and
of heart? But I
know the
purport of
your
answer
So pray
thee keep thy comments to
thyself
, and be
sparing
of your compliments on this part of
my conductfor I do not love flattery. A
month has
elapsed
since
my arrival in town.
What will the revolution of another moon
bring forth?
Your &c.
LETTER IV.
Miss
HARRIOT FAWCET to
Miss
MYRA
HARRINGTON.
BOSTON.
I
have
somehow
bewitched a
new lover, my dear
Myra
a
smart
, clever
fellow tooand the youth
expresses
such
fondness
and
passion
that I begin to feel
afraid even to pity himfor love will
certainly
follow. I own to you I
esteem
him
very much, but
must
I go any farther? He
is extremely generouspolitegayand I
believe if you were to
see
him, your
partiality
in his favour would exceed mine.
I NEVER
saw
my poor
swain
so
seemingly
disconcerted
and
abashed
as he was a few
days agohe appeared to have
something
very particular to communicate, but his
tongue faulteredought not one to help
out a
modest
youth in
such
cases
?
Your &c.
LETTER V.
Miss
MYRA HARRINGTON to Mrs.
HOLMES.
BOSTON.
Are
the rural
pleasures
of
Belleview
,
my dear friend,
so
engaging as to
debar
us of the
pleasure
of your company
forever? Do your dear groves, and your
books,
still
employ your meditating mind?
Serious
sentimentalist
as you are, let me
ask
,
whether a Ball, a Concert or Serenade,
would not afford you the
satisfac
tion of a
contemplative walk in your garden,
listening
to the love tales of the melodious
inhabitants
of the air?
RAILLERY apartwhen
shall
I take
upon
myself
the honour to wait upon you
here?I want to
advise
with you on
certain
points of female conduct, and about my
new
dress
I have heard you
say
,
lessons
to
a volatile mind
should
be
fresh
and
fresh
applied
,
because
it either pretends to
despise
them, or has a tendency to degeneracy
Now you
must
know I am actually
degenerating
for want of
some
of your
Mentor
like
lessons
of
instruc
tion. I have
scarcely
any opinion of my own,
these
fashions
,
changing about
so
often, are enough to
vitiate
the
best
taste
in the world.
I FORGOT to tell you my brother has
been at home this month; but, from
certain
indubitable
symptoms
, I
suspec
t the
young man to be in love.
HEIGHHO! what is become of
Worthy?
The time of my liberty
steals
away, for you
know I was to have three or four months
of liberty before I gave
myself
up to his
authority
,
and
relinquished
all my right and
title to the name of
Harrington
.
LETTER VI.
HARRINGTON to WORTHY.
ROSTON.
Abashed
confounded
defeated
I
waited upon my beloved with my
head well
furnished
with ready made
arguments
,
to prevail on her to
acquiesce
in my
benevolent
scheme
she
never appeared
so
amiablegrace accompanied every word
she
uttered, and every action
she
performed.
Think, my love,
said
I, in a tone
something
between
sighing
and tears, and took
her hand in a very cordial manner
Think, my love, on your
present
,
unhappy
,
menial
situation
, in the family of Mrs.
Francis
. I enlarged on the violence of my
passion
expatiated
most
metaphysically
on
our future
happiness
; and concluded by
largely
answering
objections. Shall we
not, continued I, obey the dictates of
nature
,
rather than confine
ourselves
to the
forced, unnatural rules ofandand
shall
the halcyon days of youth
slip
through
our fingers unenjoyed?
Do you think,
Worthy
, I
said
this to
Harriot
?
Not
a
syllable
of it. It was
impossible
my
heart had the courage to dictate,
but my rebellious tongue
refused
to utter
a wordit faultered
stammered
hesitated
.
THERE is a language of the eyesand we
converfed in that language; and though I
said
not a word with my tongue,
she
seemed
perfectly to
understand
my meaningfor
she
looked
(and I comprehended it as well
as if
she
had
said
)Is the crime of
dependence
to be expiated by the
sacrifice
of
virtue? And
because
I am a poor,
unfortunate
girl,
must
the little I have be taken from
me? No, my love,
answered
I,
passionately
,
it
shall
not.
OF all
those
undescribable
things which
influence the mind, and which are
most
apt
to
persuade
none is
so
powerful an orator
so
feelingly eloquent as beautyI bow to
the allconquering force of
Harriot
's
eloquence
and
what is the confequence?I
am now determined to continue my
addresses
on a principle the
most
just
, and the
most
honourable.
HOW amiable is that beauty which has its
foundation in
goodness
!
Reason
cannot
contemplate its power with indifference
Wisdom
cannot refrain from
enthusiasm
and the
sneering
exertions of Wit cannot
render it ridiculous. There is a
dignity
in
confcious virtue
that all my impudence
cannot
bring me to
despise
and if it be beauty
C
that
subdues
my heart, it is
this
that
completes
the triumphIt is here my pompous
parade, and all my
flimsy
subterfuges
, appear
to me in their proper light. In fine, I have
weighed matters maturely
, and the alternative
is
Harriot
must
be mine, or I
miserable
without her.I have
so
well weighed the
matter that even this idea is a
flash
of joy
to my heartBut, my friend,
after the
lightning
comes the thunder
my father is mortally
averse
to my making any matrimonial
engagement
at
so
early a periodthis is a bar
in my way, but I
must
leap over it.
Adieu!
LETTER VII.
Mrs. HOLMES to
Miss
HARRINGTON.
RELLEVIEW.
Although
my attachment
to
Belleview
is not
so
romantick as your airy
pen has
described
it, I think its quiet and
amusements
infinitely preferable to the
busfle
and parade with which you are
surrounded
.
THE improvements made here by my
late
husband
(who inherited the virtues of
his parents, who
still
protect me, and
endeavour
to
console
the
anguish
of his
loss
by the
most
tender affection) have rendered
the charms of
Belleview
superiour
in my
estimation
to every gilded
scene
of the gay
world.
IT is
almost
vanity to pretend to give you
a
description
of the beauty of the
prospect
the grandeur of the river that rolls through
the meadow in front of the
house
, or any
eulogium on rural elegance,
because
these
scenes
are common to
most
places in the
country. Nature is every where liberal in
dispensing
her beauties and her variety
and I pity
those
who look round and
declare
they
see
neither.
A GREAT proportion of our
happiness
depends on our own choiceit offers
itself
to our
taste
, but it is the heart that gives it
a
relish
what at one time, for
instance
, we
think to be humour, is at another
disgustful
or
insipid
so
,
unless
we carry our appetite
with us to the treat, we
shall
vainly
wish
to
make
ourselves
happy. Was I in a
defart
,
says
Sterne
, I would find wherewith
in it to call forth my affectionsIf I could
do no better, I would
fasten
them on
some
sweet
myrtle, or
seek
some
melan
choly
cypress
to connect
myself
toI
would court their
shade
and greet them
kindly for their protectionIf their leaves
withered, I would teach
myself
to mourn,
and when they rejoiced, I would rejoice
along with them.
I BELIEVE you could hardly find the way
to the
summer
house
, where we have
enjoyed
many happy hours together, and
which you
used
to call The
Temple
of
Apollo
. It is now more elegantly
furnished
than it formerly was, and is enriched
C 2
with a
considerable
addition to the library
and
musick
.
IN front of the avenue that leads to this
place, is a figure of CONTENT, pointing
with one hand to the Temple, and with the
other to an INVITATION, executed in
such
an antique
style
, that you would think it
done either by the ancient inhabitants of
the country, or by the hand of a Fairy
she
is very particular in the characters
she
invites
,
but
those
whom
she
invites
she
heartily
welcomes.
Rural Inscription
.
COME YE who loath the horrid
crest
,
Who hate the fiery front of Mars;
Who
scorn
the meanthe
sordid
breast
Who fly AMBITION's guilty cares:
Ye
who are
blest
with peaceful
souls
,
Rest
HERE: Enjoy the
pleasures
round;
Here
Fairies quaffe their acorn bowls,
And lightly print the mazy ground.
Thrice welcome to this humble
scene
(To YE alone
such
scenes
belong)
Peace
smiles
upon the fragrant green,
And HERE the WOODLAND SISTERS throng,
And fair CONTENTMENT's
pleasing
train,
Whilst
in the Heav'n the
stars
advance,
With many a maid and many a
swain
,
Lead up the jocund, rural dance.
Thriee welcome to our calm retreat,
Where INNOCENCY oft hath
strove
,
With violet blue, and woodbine
sweet
,
To form the votive wreath to LOVE:
O! pardon then, our cautious pride
(Caution, a virtue rare, I ween)
For evils with the great abide,
Which dwell not in our
sylvan
scene
.
THESE are the
scenes
to which I have
chosen
to retreat; contented with the
suffrage
of the virtuous and the good, and
inattentive
to the contemptuous
sneer
of the giddy
and the futile, for even
these
have the vanity
to look with pity on
those
who voluntarily
remove from whatever agrees with
their
ideas of
pleasure
. He who has no
conception
of the beauties of the mind, will
contemn
a
person
aukward or illfavoured; and
one
whose
store
of enjoyment is drawn from
affluence and abundance, will be
astonished
at the conduct of him who finds
cause
to
rejoice, though
surrounded
with
inconvenience
and penury. Hence we judge of the
happiness
of others by the
standard
of our
own conduct and prejudices.
FROM this misjudging race I retire,
without
a
sigh
to mingle in their
amusements
,
nor yet
disgusted
at whatever is thought of
sufficient
consequence
to engage their
pursuits
.
I fly from the tumult of the town
from
scenes
of
boisterous
pleasure
and riot,
to
those
of
quietness
and peace, where
every breeze breathes health, and every
sound
is the echo of tranquillity.On this
subject
I give my
sentiments
to you with
freedom, from a conviction that I bear the
world no
spleen
; at the
same
time with a
degree of deference to the judgment of
others, from a conviction that I may be a
little prejudiced.
I HOPE to be with you
soon
in the mean
time continue to write.
Eliza Holmes

LETTER VIII.
WORTHY to HARRINGTON.
NEWYORK.
I applaud
your change of
sentiment
:
Harriot
is a good girl, and your
conduct is extremely
praiseworthy
and
honourable. It is what her virtues
incontestibly
merit.But I
advise
you
certainly
to gain your father's approbation before
you proceed
so
far as to be unable to return.
A contrary
step
might terminate in the utter
ruin of you both.Direct to me at
Belleview
for I intend to
stop
there in my
return to
Boston
.
LETTER IX.
HARRINGTON to WORTHY.
BOSTON.
I have
had a
conversation
with
my father on the
subject
of early
marriages
,
but to no
purpose
I will not be
certain
whether he
understood
my drift, but all
his arguments are applicable to my
situation
.
One
must
be an adept to argue with
him; and
interested
as he thinks
himself
in
the
result
of the debate, he cannot be
prevailed
upon to
relinquish
his
settled
opinion.
I am too much chagrined to write you even
the heads of our
conversation
. I now
stand
upon my old ground.
Adieu!
LETTER X.
WORTHY to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
I am
very happy at
present
enjoying
the
sweets
of
Belleview
with our
excellent
friend Mrs.
Holmes
. To dwell in
this delightful retreat, and to be
blest
with the
conversation
of this amiable woman,
cannot
be called
solitude
. The charms of
Nature
are here beheld in the
most
luxuriant
varietyit is here,
diversified
with a
beautiful
prospect
, the late Mr.
Holmes
planned
his garden; it is elegant, but
simple
. My
time glides off my hands
most
happilyI
am
sometimes
indulging my
solitary
reflections
in contemplating the
sublimity
of the
scenes
around meand
sometimes
in
conversation
with
Eliza
and the old people.
THE old gentleman is a man of a
most
benevolent heart; he continues to preach
is
assiduous
in the duties of his
profession
,
and is the love and admiration of his flock.
He
prescribes
for the health of the body, as
well as that of the
soul
, and
settles
all the
little
disputes
of his
parish
. They are
contented
with his judgment, and he is at once
their
parson
, their lawyer, and their
physician
.I
often read in the little building
that was
finished
by his
son
. He was a
man of an excellent
taste
, and I have paid
my tribute to his memoryIt is the
same
place that you
used
to admire, and perhaps
I improve more of my time in it on that
very account.
Adieu!
D
LETTER XI.
Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
I sit
down to give you, my dear
Myra
,
some
account of the
visitants
of
today
,
and their
conversation
. We are not
always
distinguished
by
such
company, but
perhaps it is
sometimes
necessary
; and as
it is a relaxation from thought, it
serves
to
give us more
pleasure
in returning to the
conversation
of people of ideas.
MRS.
Bourn
assumes
a higher rank in life
than
she
pretended to
seven
years ago.She
then walked on foot
she
now, by good
fortune
,
rides in a chariot. Placed, however,
in a
situation
with which her education
does not altogether comport,
she
has nothing
disagreeable
but her over
assiduity
to
please
this is
sometimes
disgusting
, for one cannot
feast
heartily upon honey: It is an errour
which a candid mind
easily
forgives. She
sometimes
appears
solicitous
to
display
her
mental
accomplishments
, and
desirous
to
improve
those
of her daughter; but it is
merely apparent.
Notwithstanding
a
temporary
wish
may
arise
towards the
attainment
of this point, a habitual vacancy nips
it in the bud.
MISS
Bourn
is about the age of fourteen
genteel, with a tolerable
share
of beauty, but
not
striking
her
dress
was elegant, but
might have been
adjusted
to more
advantage
not
altogether aukward in her
manners
,
nor yet can
she
be called graceful
she
has a peculiar air of
drollery
which takes
her by fits, and for this
reason
, perhaps, does
not avail
herself
of every opportunity of
displaying
the
modesty
of her
sex
she
has
seen
much company, but
instead
of
polishing
her
manners, it has only
increased
her
assurance
.
THUS much of the characters of our
company
. After
some
small
chat which
passed
as we took a turn in the garden, we entered
the Temple.
WHAT books would you recommend
to put into the hands of my daughter?
said
Mrs.
Bourn
, as
she
walked into the
library
it
is a matter of
some
importance.
It is a matter of
more
importance,
answered
Worthy
, than is generally imagined,
for
unless
a proper
selection
is made, one
would do better never to read at all:Now,
Madam, as much depends on the choice of
books, care
should
be taken not to put
those
in the way of young
persons
, which might
leave on their minds any
disagreeable
prejudices
,
or which has a tendency to corrupt
their morals.As obvious as your
remark
is, added Mr.
Holmes
, it is
evidently
overlooked in the common
course
of
education. We
wisely
exclude
those
persons
from our
conversation
,
whose
characters
are bad,
whose
manners are depraved,
or
whose
morals are impure; but if they are
excluded from an
apprehension
of
contaminating
our minds, how much more
dangerous
is the company of
those
books, where
D 2
the
strokes
aimed at virtue are redoubled,
and the
poison
of vice, by repeatedly
reading
the
same
thing, indelibly
distains
the
young mind?
WE all agree, rejoined
Worthy
, that
it is as great a matter of virtue and prudence
to be
circumspect
in the
selection
of our
books, as in the choice of our company.
But, Sir, the
best
things may be
subverted
to an ill
use
. Hence we may
possibly
trace the
cause
of the ill tendency of many
of the Novels extant.
MOST of the Novels, interrupted my
father, with which our female libraries are
overrun, are built on a foundation not
always
placed on
strict
morality, and in the
pursuit
of objects not always probable of
praiseworthy
.Novels, not regulated on the
chaste
principles of true
friendship
, rational
love, and connubial duty, appear to me
totally
unfit to form the minds of women, of
friends, or of wives.
BUT, as
most
young people read,
says
Mrs.
Bourn
what rule can be
bit upon
to make
study
always terminate to
advan-tage
?
IMPOSSIBLE, cried
Miss
, for I read
as much as any body, and though it may
afford
amusement
, while I am employed, I
do not remember a
single
word; when I lay
down the book.
THIS confirms what I
say
of Novels,
cried Mr.
Holmes
,
addressing
Worthy
in a
jocular manner,
just
calculated to kill time
to attract the attention of the reader for
an hour, but leave not one idea on the
mind.
I AM far from condemning every
production
in the
gross
, replied
Worthy
;
general
satire
against
any particular
class
,
or order of men, may be viewed in the
same
light as a
satire
against
the
species
it is the
same
with booksIf there are corrupt or
mortified members, it is hardly fair to
destroy
the whole body. Now I grant
some
Novels have a bad tendency, yet there are
many which contain excellent
sentiments
let
these
receive their
deserved
rewardlet
those
be
discountenanced
; and if it is
impossible
to
smite
them with an apoplexy, there
is a moral certainty of their dying of a
consumption
.But, as Mrs.
Bourn
observes
,
most
young
persons
read, I will
therefore
recommend to
those
who
wish
to
mingle
instruction
with entertainment, method
and regularity in reading. To
dip
into
any
book
burthens the mind with
unnecessary
lumber, and may rather be called a
disadvantage
,
than a benefitThe record of
memory is
so
serawled
and blotted with
imperfect
ideas, that not one legible character
can be traced.
WERE I to throw my thoughts on this
subject
,
said
my good father-in-law, as he
began to enter more warmly into the debate
drawing his chair
opposite
Worthy
, and
raising
his hand with a poetical
enthusiasm
Were I to throw my thoughts on this
subject
into an Allegory, I would
describe
the human mind as an
extensive
plain, and
knowledge as the river that
should
water it.
If the
course
of the river be properly dire
cted
,
the plain will be fertilized and
cultivated
to advantage; but if books, which are
the
sources
that feed this river,
rush
into it
from every quarter, it will overflow its
banks, and the plain will become
inundated
:
When, therefore, knowledge flows on in
its proper channel, this
extensive
and
valuable
field, the mind,
instead
of being
covered
with
stagnant
waters, is cultivated to the
utmost
advantage, and blooms luxuriantly
into a general
efflorescence
for a river
properly
restricted
by high banks, is
necessarily
progressive
.
THE old gentleman brought down his
hand with great
selemnity
, and we
complimented
him on his poetical exertion. I
cannot comprehend the meaning of this
matter,
said
the penetrative
Miss
Bourn
.
I will explain it to you, my little dear,
said
he, with great good natureIf you
read with any
design
to improve your mind
in virtue and every amiable
accomplishment
,
you
should
be careful to read methodically,
which will enable you to form an
estimate
of the various topicks
discussed
in company;
and to bear a part in all
those
conversations
which belong to your
sex
you
see
,
therefore
,
how
necessary
general knowledge is
what would you think of a woman advanced
in life, who has no other
store
of knowledge,
than what
she
has obtained from
experi-ence
?
I THINK
she
would have a
sorry
time
of it;
answered
Miss
.
TO prevent it in
yourself
,
said
Mrs.
Bourn
to her daughter, be
assiduous
to lay
in a good
stock
of this knowledge, while
your mind is yet free from prejudice and
care.
HOW
shall
I
go to work
, Madam,
enquired
the delicate daughter.
MRS.
Bourn
turned towards Mr.
Holmes
,
which was hint enough for the good old
man to proceed.
THERE is a medium to be
observed
,
continued he, in a lady's reading;
she
is
not to receive every thing
she
finds, even in
the
best
books, as invariable
lessons
of
conduct
;
in books written in an
easy
, flowing
style
, which excel in
description
and the
luxuriance
of fancy, the imagination is apt to
get heated
she
ought, therefore, to
discern
with an eye of judgment, between the
superficial
and the penetratingthe elegant
and the tawdrywhat may be merely
amusing
,
and what may be
useful
. General
reading will not teach her a true knowledge
of the world.
IN books
she
finds recorded the
faithfulness
of
friendship
the
constancy
of
true
love
, and even that
honesty
is the
best
policy
.
E
If virtue is
represented
carrying its
reward
with it,
she
too
easily
persuades
herself
that mankind have adopted this plan: Thus
she
finds, when, perhaps, it is too late, that
she
has entertained wrong notions of human
nature; that her friends are deceitfulher
lovers
false
and that men
consult
interest
oftener than
honesty
.
A YOUNG lady who has imbibed her
ideas of the world from
desultory
reading,
and placed confidence in the virtue of others,
will bring back
disappointment
, when
she
expected gratitude.
Unsuspicious
of deceit,
she
is
easily
deceivedfrom the purity of her
own thoughts,
she
trusts
the faith of
mankind
,
until experience convinces her of her
errour
she
falls a
sacrifice
to her credulity,
and her only
consolation
is the
simplicity
and
goodness
of her heart.
THE
story
of
Miss
Whitman
[1]
[1]
THIS young lady was of a reputable family in
Connecticut
.
In her youth
she
was admired for beauty and
good
sense
. She was a great reader of novels and
romances
,
and having imbibed her ideas of
the characters of
men
, from
those
fellacious
sources
, became vain and
coquetish
,
and rejected
several
offers of marriage, in
expectation
of receiving one more agreeable to her fanciful
idea
.
Disappointed
in her
Fairy
hope, and finding her
train of admirers
less
solicitous
for the honour of her
hand, in proportion as the
roses
of youth decayed,
she
was
the more
easily
persuaded
to
relinquish
that
stability
which
is the honour and
happiness
of the
sex
. The
consequences
of her amour becoming
visible
,
she
acquainted her
lover of her
situation
, and a
husband
was
proposed
for
her, who was to receive a
considerable
sum
for
preserving
the reputation of the lady; but, having received
security
for the payment, he immediately withdrew. She then
left her friends, and travelled in the
stage
as far as
Watertown
,
where
she
hired a young man to conduct her in a
chaise
to
Salem
. Here
she
wandered alone and
friendless
,
and at length repaired to the
Bell-Tavern
, in
Danvers
,
where
she
was delivered of a
lifeless
child, and in about a
fortnight after (in
July
, 1788) died of a puerperal fever,
aged about 35 years.
Before her death
she
amused
herself
with reading,
writing
and needlework, and though in a
state
of anxiety,
preserved
a
cheerfulness
, not
so
much the effect of
insensibility
,
as of patience and fortitude. She was
sensible
of
her approaching fate, as appears from the following letter,
which was written in characters.
MUST I die alone? Shall I never
see
you more? I
know that you will come, but you will come too late:
This is, I fear, my
last
ability. Tears fall
so
, I know not
how to write. Why did you leave me in
so
much
dissstress
?
But I will not reproach you: All that was dear I
left for you; but do not regret it.May God forgive in
both what was
amiss
: When I go from hence, I will leave
you
some
way to find me; if I die, will you come and
drop a tear over my grave?
In the following Poem,
she
, like the dying
Swan
, fings
her own Elegy, and it is here added, as a
sorrowful
instance
,
how often the
best
, and
most
pleasing
talents, not
accompanied by virtue and prudence, operate the
destruction
of their
possessor
.
The
description
of her unfortunate
passion
, will remind
the critical reader of the famous ode of
Sappbo
. In
genius
and in misfortune,
these
poetical ladies were
similar
.
DISAPPOINMENT
.
WITH fond impatience all the tedious day
I
sigh
'd, and
wish
'd the lingering hours away;
For when bright
Hesper
led the
starry
train,
My
shepherd
swore
to meet me on the plain;
With eager
haste
to that dear
spot
I flew,
And linger'd long, and then with tears withdrew:
Alone, abandon'd to love's
tenderest
woes,
Down my pale cheeks the tide of
sorrow
flows;
Dead to all joys that fortune can
bestow
,
In vain for me her
useless
bounties flow;
Take back each envied gift, ye pow'rs divine,
And only let me call
Fidelio
mine.
Ah, wretch! what
anguish
yet thy
soul
must
prove,
Ere thou
canst
hope to
lose
thy care in love;
And when
Fidelio
meets thy tearful eye,
Pale fear and cold
despair
his
presence
fly;
With
pensive
steps
, I
sought
thy walks again,
And
kiss
'd thy token on the verdant plain;
With
fondest
hope, thro' many a
blissful
bow'r,
We gave the
soul
to fancy's pleafing pow'r;
Lost
in the magick of that
sweet
employ,
To build gay
scenes
, and
fashion
future joy,
We
saw
mild peace o'er fair
Canan
rife,
And
show
'r her
blessings
from benignant
skies
;
On airy hills our happy
mansion
rose
,
Built but for joy, no room for future woes;
Sweet as the
sleep
of innocence, the day,
(By
transports
measur
'd) lightly danc'd away;
To love, to
bliss
, the union'd
soul
was given,
And each! too happy,
ask
'd no brighter heaven.
And
must
the hours in
ceaseless
anguish
roll?
Will no
soft
sunshine
cheer my clouded
soul
Can this dear earth no
transient
joy
supply
?
Is it my doom to hope,
despair
and die?
Oh! come, once more, with
soft
endearments come,
Burst
the cold
prison
of the
sullen
tomb;
Through favour'd walks, thy
chosen
maid attend,
Where well known
shades
their
pleasing
branches bend,
Shed the
soft
poison
from thy
speaking
eye,
And look
those
raptures
lifeless
words deny;
Still be, though late, reheard what ne'er could tire,
But, told each eve,
fresh
pleasures
would
inspire
;
Still hope
those
scenes
which love and fancy drew;
But, drawn a
thousand
times, were ever new.
Can fancy paint, can words
express
;
Can aught on earth my woes
redress
E'en thy
soft
smiles
can
ceaseless
prove
Thy truth, thy
tenderness
and love.
Once thou
couldst
every
bliss
inspire
,
Transporting
JOY, and gay DESIRE:
Now cold DESPAIR her banner rears,
And PLEASURE flies when
she
appears;
Fond HOPE within my
bosom
dies,
And AGONY her place
supplies
:
O, thou! for
whose
dear
sake
I bear,
A doom
so
dreadful,
so
severe
May happy fates thy
footsteps
guide,
And o'er thy peaceful home
preside
Nor let Eliza's early tomb
Infect
thee, with its baleful gloom.
is an
emphatical
illustration
of the truth of
these
observations
. An inflated fancy, not
restricted
by judgment, leads too often to
disappointment
and repentance. Such will be
the fate of
those
who become (to
use
her
own words)
Lost
in the magick of that
sweet
employ,
To build
gay
scenes
and
fashion
future joy
.
WITH a good heart
she
possessed
a
poetical
imagination, and an unbounded
thirst
for
novelty; but
these
airy talents, not
counterpoised
with judgment, or perhaps
serious
reflection
,
instead
of adding to her
happiness
,
were the
cause
of her ruin.
E 2
I CONCLUDE from your
reasoning
,
said
I, and it is,
besides
, my own opinion, that
many fine girls have been ruined by reading
Novels.
AND I believe, added Mrs.
Bourn
we may trace from hence the
causes
of
spleen
in many
persons
advanced in life.
YOU mean old maids, Madam, cries
the
sagacious
Miss
, like my aunt
Deborah
she
calls all the men deceitful, and
most
women, with her, are no better than they
should
be.
WELL
said
exclaimed
Worthy
, the
recollection of chagrin and former
disappointment
,
sours
one's temper and mortifies
the heart
disappointment
will be more or
less
severe
in proportion as we elevate our
expectations; for the
most
sanguine
tempers
are the
soonest
discouraged
; as the
highest
building is in the
most
danger of falling.
IT appears from what I have
said
resumed
Mr.
Holmes
, that
those
books which
teach us a knowledge of the world are
useful
to form the minds of females, and ought
therefore to be
studied
.
I MENTIONED
Rochefoucault's
maxims.
DO they not degrade human nature?
enquired my father.
THIS little book,
answered
Worthy
,
contains much truthand
those
short
sketches
traced by the hand of
judgment
,
present
to us the leading features of
mankind. But, replied my father,
that
interest
should
assume
all
shapes
, is a
doctrine
,
which, in my mind,
represents
a
caricature
rather than a living picture. It is
the duty of a painter to produce a
likeness
,
said
Worthy
.And a
skilful
one, cried
my father, continuing the metaphor, will
bring the amiable qualities of the heart to
light; and throw
those
which
disgrace
humanity
into the
shade
. I doubt,
rejoined
Worthy
, whether this flattery will
answer
the
purpose
you aim to
accomplish
You entertain a high opinion of
the dignity
of human nature
, and are
displeased
at the
author
who advances any thing derogatory to
that dignity.
Swift
, in
speaking
of
these
maxims, in one of his
best
poems, affirms,
They argue no corrupted mind
In himthe fault is in mankind.
AS I began this
subject
, added I, it
shall
be ended by one
observation
As
these
maxims
give us an idea of the manners and
characters
of men, among whom a young
person
is
soon
to appear; and as it is
necessary
to her
security
and
happiness
that
she
be
made acquainted with themthey may be
read to advantage.
THERE is another medium,
said
Mr.
Holmes
,
assenting
to my
observation
, to be
noticed in the
study
of a lady
she
takes up
a book, either for
instruction
or
entertainment
;
the medium lies in knowing when
to put it down.
Constant
application
becomes
labourit
sours
the tempergives an
air of
thoughtfulness
, and frequently of
absence
.
By
immoderate reading
we hoard up
opinions and become
insensibly
attached to
them; this
miserly
conduct
sinks
us to
affectation
,
and
disgustful
pedantry;
conversation
only can remedy this dangerous evil,
strengthen
the judgment, and make reading really
useful
. They mutually depend upon, and
assist
each other.
A KNOWLEDGE of HISTORY which
exhibits
to us in one view the
rise
,
progress
and
decay of nationswhich points out the
advancement
of the mind in
society
, and the
improvements in the arts which adorn
human
nature, comes with propriety under the
notice of a lady. To
observe
the origin of
civilizationthe gradual
progress
of
society
,
and the
resinements
of manners, policy,
morality
and religionto
observe
the
progression
of mankind from
simplicity
to luxury,
from luxury to effeminacy, and the gradual
steps
of the decline of empire, and the
dissolution
of
states
and kingdoms,
must
blend
that happy union of
instruction
and
entertainment
,
which never fails to win our
attention
to the
pursuit
of all
subjects
.
POETRY claims her due from the ladies.
POETRY enlarges and
strengthens
the mind,
refines the
taste
and improves the judgment.
It has been afferted that women have no
business
with
satire
now
satire
is but a
branch of poetry. I acknowledge, however,
much
false
wit is
sent
into the world, under
this general title; but no critick with whom
I am acquainted ever called
satire
false
wit
for as long as vice and folly continue to
predominate
in the human heart, the
satirist
will be
considered
as a
useful
member of
society
. I believe
Addison
calls him an
auxiliary
to the pulpit. Suffer me to
enlarge
on this
new idea
. Satire is the
correction
of the vices and follies of the human
heart; a woman may, therefore, read it to
advantage. What I mean by enforcing this
point, is, to
impress
the minds of females
with a principle of
self
correction; for
among
all kinds of knowledge which
arise
from reading, the duty of
self
knowledge is
a very eminent one; and is at the
same
time, the
most
useful
and important.
OUR ordinary
intercourse
with the world,
will
present
to us in a very clear point of
view, the fallacious ideas we
sometimes
entertain
of our own
self
knowledge.We are
blinded by pride and
self
love, and will not
observe
our own imperfections, which we
F
blame with the
greatest
acrimony in
other people, and
seem
to deteft with the
greatest
abhorrence;
so
that it often happens,
while we are branding our neighbour for
some
foible, or vanity, we
ourselves
are
equally guilty.
RIDICULOUS as this conduct
must
appear
in the eyes of all judicious people, it is
too frequently
practised
to
escape
observa-tion
.
I WILL drop this piece of morality,
with a charge to the fair reader, that
whenever
she
discovers
a fatire, ridiculing or
recriminating
the follies or crimes of mankind,
that
she
look into her own heart, and
compare
the
strictures
on the conduct of others
with her own feelings.
LETTER XII.
Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA.
In Continuation.
My good father-in-law being
so
strenuous
in proving the eligibility of
reading
satire
, had
spun
out, what he called his
new idea
, to
such
a metaphyfical nicety, that
he unhappily
diminished
the number of his
hearers; for Mrs.
Bourn
, to whom he directed his
discourse
, had taken down a book
and was reading to
herself
, and
Miss
was
diverting
herself
with the cuts in
Gay's
Fables
.
A CONSIDERABLE
silence
ensued
, which
Worthy
first
broke, by
asking
Mrs.
Bouru
what book
she
had in her hand. Every
one's attention was alarmed at this
important
enquiry. Mrs.
Bourn
, with little
difficulty
,
found the title page, and began to
read,
A Sentimental Journey through France
and Italy, by Mr.
Yorick.
I DO not like the
title
,
said
Miss
Bourn
.
WHY, my dear!
apostrophized
the
mother, you are
mistaken
it is a very
famous
book.
WHY, my dear! retorted the
daughter
,
It is
sentimental
I abominate every
thing that is
sentimental
it is
so
unfashionable
too.
I NEVER knew before,
said
Mr.
Holmes
, that wit was
subject
to the caprice
of
fashion
.
WHY 'Squire
Biily
, returned
Miss
,
who is
just
arrived from the centre of
politeness
and
fashion
,
says
the
bettermost
genil
never read any
sentimental
books
so
you
see
sentiment
is out of date.
THE company rofe to go out.
SENTIMENT out of date! cries
Worthy
,
repeating the words of
Miss
Bourn
, and
taking the book from her mother, as
she
walked towards the doorSentiment out
of datealas! poor
Yorick
may thy pages
never be foiled by the fingers of prejudice.
He continued his
address
to the book, as they
went out, in the
same
Shandean
tone
These
antisentimentalists
would
banish
thee from
the
society
of all books! Unto what a pitiful
size
are the race of
readers
dwindled!
Surely
F 2
these
antis
have no more to do with thee,
than the gods of the
Canaanites
In character and
understanding
they are alikeeyes
have
they
, but they
see
notears have
they
,
but they hear not, neither is there any
knowledge
to be found in them. It is
hardly
worth while to beat it into them,
said
my father-in-law,
so
let us follow the
company
.
WE did
so
they walked towards the
house
, and
Worthy
and
myself
brought up
the rear.
I COULD not but remark, as we went on,
that
Miss
Bourn
had
spoken
the
sentiments
of many of her
sex
;and whence,
said
I to
Worthy
,
arises
this
detestation
of books
in
some
of us females, and why are
they
enemies
to any thing that may be called
sentiment
and
conversation
: I grant it often
happens there is
such
rapidity of
speeches
that
one may be at a
loss
to
distinguish
the
speakers
;
but why is there
such
a calm
silence
,
should
an unfortunate
sentiment
inadvertantly
I WILL tell you, interrupted he, You
all read, and it is from the books which
engage
your attention, that you generally
imbibe
your ideas of the principal
subjects
discussed
in companynow, the books which
employ your hours of
study
, happen to be
Novels; and the
subjects
contained in
these
Novels are commonly confined to
dress
, balls,
visiting
, and the like
edifying
topicks; does it
not follow, that
these
must
be the
subjects
of your
conversation
? I will not
dispute
whether the Novel makes the woman, or the
woman makes the Novel; or whether they
are written to engage your attention, or
flatter your vanity. I believe the
result
will
shew
they depend, in
some
measure
, upon
each other; and an uninformed woman,
by reading them, only augments the number
of her futile ideas.
The female mind
,
notwithstanding
,
is competent to any
task
, and the
accomplishments
of an elegant woman
depend
on a proper cultivation of her
intelligent
powers; a barrennefsa
sterility
of
conversation
immediately
discovers
where
this cultivation is wanting.
GIVE me leave,
answered
I, to
efpouse
the
cause
of this
class
of females. Tell
me candidly, Mr.
Worthy
, whether that
insipid
flattery, perhaps
sacrificed
at the
expense
of truth, does not
misguide
many of
us into erroneous paths? You declare we
are
handsome
and your conduct
demonstrates
you to be more
solicitous
for the
possession
of
beautiful
, than of
mental
charms.
Hence is the deluded female
persuaded
of
the force of her
fascinating
powers, and
vainly imagines one glance of her eye
sufficient
to reduce a million of hearts
whenever
she
chooses
: Her aims, therefore, are
confined to the decoration of her
person
, and
her views centre
solely
in
finishing
herself
in
those
attractive, allpowerful graces, with
which you declare
yourselves
to be enchanted.
How then are they to be
censured
for
neglecting
to improve, and to adorn the mind,
when your adulation diverts their attention
to an external object?
I JOIN with you, replied
Worthy
, in
calling it
insipid
flatteryand the vain
coxcomb
,
the powdered beau, the
insignificant
petit maitre
, are
those
who make
use
of it.
Will women of real merit, and
sound
sense
,
believe, what is
said
by
them
to be
their
real
sentiments
?NoThere
must
be a
congeniality
in the minds of
those
who give and
receive flatteryHas not the vain coquette
as much inclination to be thought a
goddess
,
as the empty admirer to declare her
so
?
FLATTERY is become a kind of
epidemical
distemper
; many run into it, perhaps,
without
designing
it, or only through civility.
There are
some
women who expect it
who
dress
to be admiredand who deem it
a mark of
impoliteness
and
rudeness
in men,
who do not pay them the tribute of
compliment
and adulation. A man of
sense
may
comply with their expectationhe will
still
think them agreeable
playthings
, to divert
him at an hour of relaxation; but I cannot
suppose
he will entertain any ferious
thoughts of
a more permanent connexion
.
MAY we not conclude
these
things to
be productive of many evils that happen in
society
do they not frighten all
sentiment
from
conversation
introduce affectation
prideenvy
clandestine
marriages
elopements
division
of familiesand
ultimately
terminate in the
ruin
of very many

BELLEVIEW.
A PEACEFUL,
recluse
life, is
suited
to my temperthere is
something
in
the
soft
breath of Naturein the delicacy of
smiling
meadows and cultivated fieldsin
the
sublimity
of an aged woodof broken
rocksof rivers pouring along their lucid
waves, to which the heart always gives a
ready receptionthere is
something
within
us congenial to
these
scenes
; they
impress
the mind with ideas
similar
to what we feel
in beholding one whom we tenderly
esteem
.
I WAS making this
observation
to Mrs.
Holmes
, and
she
told me I was in love
These
are the very
scenes
,
said
she
,
which your beloved
Myra
used
to
praise
and admire, and for which you, by a
secret
sympathy
, entertain the
same
predilection.
The piece of embroidery which
she
worked
at an early age, and which ornaments the
Temple, I have
seen
you gaze upon
several
timesyou
seem
to trace perfection in every
G
part of it,
because
it was executed by the
hand of
Myra
.
I ACKNOWLEDGE I have often
gazed
upon it (as Mrs.
Holmes
terms it) but did
not recollect it to be a piece of your work.
I
stole
an opportunity to
revisit
it by
myself
,
and I
instantly
remembered itI
remembered
when you
finished
it, and all the
happy
,
inoffensive
scenes
of our childhood,
returned
fresh
upon my heart.
IT is the work of
Myra
,
said
I to
myself
Did not her fingers trace
these
beautiful,
expanding flowers?Did not
she
give to
this carnation its animated glow, and to this
opening
rose
its
languishing
grace?
Removed
as I amcontinued I in a certain
interiour
language that every
son
of nature
possesses
Removed
as I am, from the amiable
object of my
tenderest
affection, I have
nothing
to do but to admire this offspring of
industry
and artIt
shall
yield more
fragrance
to my
soul
than all the
boquets
in the
universe
.
I DID not care to
pursue
the thoughtit
touched a delicate
string
at
first
, however,
I flattered
myself
I
should
gain
some
confolation
but
I
lost
in every reflection.
I CONSIDERED the work as coming from
your hand, and was delighted the more with
it. A piece of
steel
that has been rubbed
with a
loadstone
, retains the power of
attracting
small
bodies of iron: So the
beauties
of this embroidery,
springing
from your
hands, continue to draw my attention, and
fill the mind with ideas of the
artist
.
Farewel!

I WISH you could be here to

with
what
ease

I cannot give a

wish
to conveyYou will tell me I am in

its natureto

it of its mere

consider
it as it may be

she

described
in her native
simplicity

captivating

and at length the
task
of
description
is given up as altogether
undescribable

Are not all
these
in
themselves
bare
insignificant
words? The world has
so
long
been
accustomed
to hear the
sound
of them,
that the idea is
lost

question
What is love?
Unless
it is
answered
now,

perhaps it never will be. Is it not an
infinitude
of graces that accompany every thing
said
by
Harriot?
That adorn all
she
does?
They
must
not be taken
severally
they
cannot
be contemplated in the
abstract
.If you
proceed to a chymical
analysis
, their tenuous
essence
will evaporatethey are in
themselves
nothing, but the aggregate is love.

LETTER XVII.
HARRINGTON to WORTHY.
BOSTON.
Our
little party was overthrown
by a
strange
piece of folly. A
Miss
P
was introduced, a young lady of beauty and
elegant
accomplishments
. The whole
company
were beginning to be cheerful
business
and care were
disgusted
at the
sight
of
so
many happy countenances, and had gone
out from among us. Jollity and good
humour
bade us prepare for the dance
unhappily
at this juncture a lady and
gentleman
were engaged in a
conversation
concerning
Miss
P, and one of them
repeated
the words a mechanick's daughter
it is
supposed
the word mechanick was
repeated
scornfully
She heard itthought
herself
insulted
and indignantly retired
Disorder
and
confusion
immediately took
place, and the
amusement
was put an end to
for the evening.
I WISH people would
consider
how little
time they have to frolick herethat they
would improve it to more advantage, and
not
dispute
for any precedence or
superiority
but in good nature and
sociability
a
mechanick
and
pray whence this
distinction
!
INEQUALITY among mankind is a
soe
to
our
happiness
it even affects our little
parties of
pleasure
Such is the fate of the
human race, one order of men lords it over
another; but upon what grounds its right
is founded I could never yet be
satisfied
.
FOR this
reason
, I like a democratical
better than any other kind of government:
and were I a
Lycurgus
no
distinction
of rank
should
be found in my commonwealth.
IN my tour through the United States, I
had an opportunity of examining and
comparing
the different manners and
dispositions
of the inhabitants of the
several
republicks.
Those
of the
southern
states
,
accustomed
to
a habit of domineering over their
slaves
, are
haughtier, more tenacious of honour, and
indeed
possess
more of an
aristocratick
temper
than their
sisters
of the confederacy.
As we travel to the northward, the nature
of the
constitution
seems
to operate on the
minds of the people
slavery
is
abolished
all men are declared free and equal, and
their tempers are open, generous and
communicative
.
It is the
same
in all
those
countries where the people enjoy
independence
and equal liberty. Why then
should
those
distinctions
arise
which are inimical to
domestick
quietude? Or why
should
the
noisy
voice of
those
who
seek
distin
ction,
so
loudly reecho in the ears of peace and jollity,
as to deafen the
sound
of the
musick
For
while we are
disputing
who
shall
lead off the
dance, behold! the
instrument
gets out of
tunea
string
snaps
and where is our
chance for dancing?

NO thoughts, but thoughts of

If
a
wish
,
arising
from the
most
tender affection, could
transport
me to the
object of my love, I
persude
myself
that
you would not be troubled with reading this
letter.
YOU
must
expect nothing like wit or
humour
,
or even common
sense
, from me; wit
and humour are flown with you, and your
return only can
restore
them. I am
sometimes
willing to
persuade
myself
that this is
the
case
I think I hear the well known
voice, I look around me with the
ecstacy
of
Orpheus
but that look breaks the charm, I
find
myself
alone, and my
Eurydice
vanished
to the
shades
.
I HOPE you will not permit
yourself
to
grow envious of the beauties of
Rhodeisland
Of the force of their charms I am
experimentally
acquainted. Whereever fortune
has thrown me, it has been my
happiness
to imagine
myself
in love with
some
divine
creature or other; and after all it is but
truth to declare that the
passion
was
seated
more in fancy than the heart; and it is
justice
to acknowledge to you that I am now
more provident of my
passion
, and never
suffer
the
excursion
of fancy, except when I am
so
liberal as to admit the united
beauty
of the
Rhodeisland
ladies in competition with
yours.
WHERE there are
handsome
women there
will
necessarily
be fine gentlemen, and
should
they be
smitten
with your
external graces
, I
cannot but lament their deplorable
situation
,
when they
discover
how
egregiously
they
have been cheated. What
must
be his
dis-appointment
,
who thought
himself
fascinated
by beauty, when he finds he has
un-knowingly
been charmed by
reason
and
virtue!
BUT this you will
say
contains a
sentiment
of
jealousy
, and is but a
transcript
of my
ap-prehensions
and gloomy anxieties: When
will your
presence
like the return of the fun
in the
spring
, which
dispels
glooms, and
re-animates
the face of nature, quiet
these
ap-prehensions
.
If it be not in a
short
time, I
H 2
shall
proceed on a journey to find you out;
until then I commit you to the care of your
guardian angel.
LETTER XX.
HARRINGTON to HARRIOT.
BOSTON.
Last
night I went on a
visit
to
your
house
: It was an adventure that would
have done honour to the Knight of
La
Mancha
. The moon
ascended
a clear,
serene
sky
, the air was
still
, the bells
sounded
the
solemn
hour of midnightI
sighed
and
the
reason
of it I need not tell you. This
was, indeed, a pilgrimage; and no
Musselman
ever travelled barefooted to
Mecca
with more
sincere
devotion.
YOUR
absence
would
cause
an
insufferable
ennui
in your friends, were it not for the art
we have in making it turn to our
amusement
.
Instead
of
wishing
you were of our party,
you are the
goddess
to
whose
honour we
perform innumerable
Heathenish
rites.
Libations
of wine are poured out, but not a
guest
presumes
to
taste
it, until they implore
the name of
Harriot
; we hail the new
divinity
in
songs
, and
strew
around the flowers
of poetry. You need not, however, take to
yourself
any extraordinary addition of
vanity
on this
occasion
, as your
absence
will not
cause
any repining:
Harriot
, our
goddess
and our grief no more.
BUT to give you
my
opinion on
this important matter, I
must
descend
to
plain truth, and acknowledge I had rather
adore you a
present
mortal, than an
absent
divinity; and therefore
wish
for your return
with more religious ardour than a devout
disciple
of the
false
prophet for the
company
of the
Houri
.
THANKS to the power of imagination for
one fanciful interview. Methought I
somewhere
unexpectedly met youbut I was
soon
undeceived of my imaginary
happiness
,
and I awoke, repeating
these
verses
:
THOUGH
sleep
her
sable
pinions
spread
,
My thoughts
still
run on you;
And
visions
hovering o'er my head,
Present
you to my view.
By FANCY's magick pencil dreft
I
saw
my Delia move;
I
clasp
'd her to my anxious
breast
,
With TEARS of joy and love.
Methought
she
said
Why thus forlorn?
Be all thy care refign'd:
I'woke and found my
Delia
gone,
But
still
the TEAR behind.
LETTER XXI.
HARRIOT to MYRA.
RHODEISLAND
We
arrived here in
safety
, but our
journey is not without incidentan incident
which exhibits a melancholy picture of the
wickedness
and depravity of the human
heart.
WHEN we came to the
house
of Mrs.
Martin
,
who, I
suppose
you know is
cousin
to
Mrs.
Francis
, we were not a little
astonished
at the evident traces of
distress
in her
countenance
;
all her actions were accompanied
with an air of
solemnity
, and her former
gaiety of heart was exchanged for
sad
,
serious
thoughtfulness
: She, however, put on
a face of vivacity upon our being introduced,
but her
cheerfulness
was foreign to the
feelings
of her heart.
MR.
Martin
was equally agitated; he
endeavoured
to
dispossess
himself
of an
uncommon
weight of
remorse
, but in vainall his
dissimulation
could not conceal his emotion,
nor his art abate the continual upbradings of,
conscious
guilt.
MRS.
Francis
was anxious to enquire the
cause
of this extraordinary change, but
wifely
forebore adding to the
distress
of her
friend, by
desiring
her to explain it, in a
manner too precipitate. She was in a
short
time made acquainted with the particulars
of the
story
which is not more melanoholy
than uncommon.
SOMETIME after the marriage of
Martin
,
the beautiful
Ophelia
,
sister
to Mrs.
Martin
,
returned from an
European
visit
, to her
friends in
Rhodeisland
. Upon her arrival,
she
received a polite offer from her
he">she
received a polite offer from her
brother-in-law
of an elegant apartment at his
house
in
town, which was cheerfully acceptedFatal
acceptation! He had conceived a
passion
for
Ophelia
and was plotting to gratify it. By
a
series
of the
most
artful attentions,
suggested
by a diabolical appetite, he
insinuated
himself
into her affectionhe prevailed
upon
the heart of the
unsuspicious
Ophelia
, and
triumphed over her innocence and virtue.
THIS
incestuous
connexion has
secretly
subsisted
until the
present
timeit was
interrupted
by a
symptom
which rendered it
necessary
for
Ophelia
to retire into the
country
,
where
she
was delivered of a child, at
once the
son
and nephew of
Martin
.
THIS event was a
severe
mortification to
the proud
spirit
of
Shepherd
, the father of
Ophelia
. His
resentment
to his daughter
was implacable, and his revenge of the
injury
from
Martin
not to be
satiated
The
blaze of family
dispute
raged with
unquenchable
furyand poor
Ophelia
received other
punishment
from the hand of a vindictive
father than bare recrimination.
THE affection of
Martin
now became
changed to the
vilest
hatred.
THUS doomed to
suffer
the
blackest
ingratitude
from her
seducer
on the one hand,
and to experience the feverity of paternal
vengeance
on the otherand before her the
gloomy
prospect
of a
blasted
reputationwhat
must
be the
situation
of the
hapless
Ophelia!
Hope, the
last
resort
of the wretched, was
forever
shut
out. There was no one whom
she
durst
implore by the tender name of
father
,
and he who had
seduced
her from her
duty and her virtue, was the
first
to brand her
with the
disgraceful
epithets, of undutiful
and
unchaste
.
I
PERHAPS it was only at this time, that
she
became fully
sensible
of her danger; the
flattery and
dissimulation
of
Martin
might
have
banished
the idea of detection, and
glossed
over that of criminality; but now
she
awoke from her dream of
insensibility
,
she
was like one who had been deluded by an
ignis fatuus
to the brink of a precipice, and
there abandoned to his reflection to
contemplate
the horrours of the
sea
beneath him,
into which he was about to plunge.
WHETHER from the
promises
of
Martin
,
or the flattery of her own fancy, is unknown,
but it is
said
she
expected to become his wife,
and made
use
of many expedients to obtain
a divorcement of
Martin
from her
sister
:
But this is the breath of rumour.
Allowing
it to be truth, it appears to be the
last
attempt of
despair
; for
such
unnatural
exertions
,
with the compuction attending them,
represent
a gloomy picture of the
struggle
between
sisterly
affection and declining
honour
.
They however proved unavailable,
and her efforts to that end, may with
propriety
be deemed a wretched
subterfuge
.
IN the mean while the rage of
Shepherd
was augmenting. Time,
instead
of
allaying
,
kindled the flame of revenge in the
breast
of the old man. A
sense
of the
wounded honour of his family, became
every day more
exquisite
; he
resolved
to
call a meeting of the parties, in which the
whole
mystery
should
be developedthat
Ophelia
should
confront her feducer, and a
thorough enquiry and explication he
brought about.
OPHELIA
exercised
all her powers to
prevent
it;
she
intreated her father to
consent
to her
desire
, but her tears and intreaties
were vain. To this
earnest
desire
of his
daughter,
Shepherd
opposed
the honour of
his family. She replied that
such
a
procedure
would
publish
its
disgrace
and be
subversive
of his intention: That
she
hoped to
live retired from the world, and it was in
his power to accept her happy repentance:
In extenuating,
she
wished
not to vindicate
her errours, but declared
herself
to be
penetrated
with a melancholy
sense
of her
miscondu
ct,
and hoped her penitence might
expiate
her guilt: She now beheld in the
mosglaring
colours, the dangers to which
she
had
been
exposed
, and acknowledged the effects
of her temerity had
impressed
her mind with
sincere
contrition: All
persons
, continued
she
, are not
blest
with the like
happiness
of
resisting
temptation;
she
intreated her
father
,
therefore, to believe her
missortunes
proceeded from credulity and not from an
abandoned principlethat they
arose
more
from
situation
than a depraved heart: In
asking
to be
restored
to the favour and
prote
ction
of a parent,
she
protested
she
was not
influenced by any other motive, than a
wish
to
demonstrate
the
sincerity
of her
repentance
,
and to
establish
the peace and
harmony
of the family.
I 2
OPHELIA
now became melancholy, and
her intentions
visibly
bent on the
manner of
her death
. As the time drew nigh, her
sensibility
became more exquifite: What was
before
distress
,
she
now averred to be
horrour
:
Her conduct bordered upon
insanity
.
THE day was appointed to bring to a
settlement
this unhappy
business
the time of

Ophelia

of the

of her parents, and of her own

clasped
her mother's hand, and
raising
her eye to heaven, was only heard to
articulate

!

Myra
this unhappy
affair
has worked me into a fit of melancholy.
I can write no more. I will give you a few
particulars in my next. It is

catastrophe
and not be

LETTER XXII.
HARRIOT to MYRA.
RHODEISLAND.
How
frail is the heart! How dim
is human
foresight
! We behold the gilded
bait of temptation, and know not until taught
by experience, that the
admission
of one
errour
is but the introduction of calamity.
One
mistake
imperceptibly leads to another
but the
consequences
of the whole
bursting
suddenly
on the devoted head of an
unfortunate
wanderer, becomes intolerable.
How acute
must
be that torture, which
seeks
an
asylum
in
suicide
!
O seduction
! how
many and how
miserable
are the victims of
thy unrelenting vengeance. Some crimes,
indeed, ceafe to afflict when they ceafe to
exist
, but SEDUCTION opens the door to a
dismal
train of innumerable
miseries
.
YOU can better imagine the
situation
of
the friends of the unfortunate
Ophelia
than
I can
describe
it.
THE writings
she
left were
expressive
of
contrition for her
past
transa
ction, and an
awful
sense
of the deed
she
was about to
execute
.
Her
miserable
life was
insupportable
,
there was no oblation but in death
she
welcomed death, therefore, as the
pleasing
harbinger of relief to the unfortunate. She
remembered her once loved
seducer
with
pity, and bequeathed him her
forgiveness
To
say
she
felt no agitation was not
just
, but
that
she
experienced a
calmness
unknown
to a criminal was certain. She hoped the
rashness
of her conduct would not be
construed
to her
disadvantage
for
she
died in
charity with the world. She felt like a poor
wanderer about to return to a tender parent,
and flattered
herself
with the hopes of a
welcome
,
though unbidden to return. She
owned the way was dark and intricate, but
lamented
she
had no friend to enlighten her
understanding
, or unravel the
mysteries
of
futurity. She knew there was a God who
will reward and
punish
: She
acknowledged
she
had offended him, and
confessed
her
repentance. She expatiated on the
miserable
life
she
had
suffered
, not that
she
feared
detection, that was
impossible
; but that
she
had been doing an injury to a
sister
who was
all
kindness
to her;
she
prayed her
sister
's
forgiveness
even as
she
herself
forgave her
seducer
; and that her crime might not be
called ingratitude,
because
she
was always
sensible
of her obligation to that
sister
. She
requested
her parents to pardon her, and
acknowledged
she
felt the pangs of a bleeding
heart at the
shock
which
must
be given to
the
most
feeling of mothers. She intreated
her
sisters
to think of her with pity, and died
with
assurance
that her friends would
so
far
revere her memory as to take up one thing
or another, and
say
this belonged to poor
Ophelia
O MY friend! what
scenes
of
anguish
are here unfolded to the
survivours
. The
unhappy
Shepherd
charged
Martin
with the
sedu
ction and murder of his daughter.
What the termination of this
most
horrible
affair will be, is not
easy
to
foresee
.
Adieu!
LETTER XXIII.
HARRIOT to MYRA.
RHODEISLAND.
Whatever
may be the
other
causes
(if there were any
besides
her
sedu
ction) which drove the unhappy
Ophelia
,
temerariously
to end her
existence
, it
certainly
becomes us, my dear friend, to attend
to themand to draw
such
morals and
lessons
of
instru
ction from each
side
of the
question
, as will be a mirrour by which we
may regulate our conduct and amend our
lives. A prudent pilot will
shun
those
rocks
upon which others have been
dashed
to
pieces, and take example from the conduct
of others
less
fortunate than
himself
: It is
the duty of the
moralist
, then, to deduce his
observations
from preceding facts in
such
a
manner as may directly improve the mind
and promote the economy of human life.
THIS may be an apology for
sending
you
the arguments of
Martin
in
answer
to
Shepherd
,
who in his rage and grief had called
him the murderer of his child.
K
HE reminded
Shepherd
of his
obstinacy
in
persisting
in an explanatory meeting, and
refusing
to grant
Ophelia
's
request
in
suffering
the affair to
subside
Your proud
spirit
,
said
he, would not hearken to the
gentle
remonstrance
of your daughteryour
heart was
closed
to every conciliatory
proposition
.
Though
she
expressed
a
propensity
to fly from the eye of the world,
she
had
hitherto appeared lulled in a kind of happy
insensibility
; yet the approaching time of
explanation was terrible, it renewed the
story
and torture of all her misfortunes, and the
idea filled her with grief and
dismay
. Had
you been as willing to receive her, as
she
to
return to you, happy would it have been for
both; but your pride was the
cause
of
additional
calamitieswhen the time arrived
But why
shall
we harrow up our
souls
with the reiteration of her
sorrowful
exit?
FROM
these
circumstances
,
said
Martin
,
you cannot
accuse
me as the
immediate
cause
of
Ophelia
's death; the facts are as I
have
stated
themand thus was a
straying
,
but penitent child, driven to
despair
and
suicide
by a
severe
use
of paternal power, and
a vain attempt to
resent
an injury, for which
it was
impossible
the
accused
party could
make
compensation
.
NOTWITHSTANDING the
plausibility
of
Martin
's plea, I have little
hesitation
in my
mind to charge him with the
remote
cause
of
the
miserable
end of
Ophelia
.
HOW far parental authority may be
extended
,
is a
question
which I
shall
not
determine
;
I
must
however think it depends upon
the combination of
circumstances
. The
duty of a child to her parents will be in
proportion
to the attention paid to her
education
.
If,
instead
of the
usual
pains
bestowed
by many partial parents, upon the vain
parade of forming the manners of a child,
and burthening the mind wiht the
necessity
of
the douceurs and the graces, would it not
often be happier for both, to take a finall
share
of thought to kindle
one
spark
of grace
in the heart?
HAPPY the parents, who have
bestowed
upon their children
such
an education, as
will enable them, by a principle of
mediocrity
,
to govern them without extorting
obedience
,
and to reclaim them without
exercising
severity
.
Farewel!

Your
sorrowful
little
history
has
infected me with grief. Surely there is no
human vice of
so
black a die
so
fatal in its
confequencesor which
causes
a more
general
calamity, than that of
seducing
a female
from the path of honour. This idea has
been improved by my brother, on the hint
of your favouras an acknowledgment for
which I
inclose

[The
Inclosed

The Court of Vice
.
An APOLOGUE.
VICE on a
solemn
night of
state
,
In all her pomp of terrour
sate
,
Her voice in deep, tremendous tone,
Thus
issu
'd from her ebon throne:
`This night at our infernal court,
`Let all our
ministers
refort;
`Who
most
annoys the human race,
`At our right hand
shall
take his place,
`Rais'd on a throneadvanc'd in fame
`Ye CRIMES now vindicate your claim.'
Eager for
praise
, the hideous
host
,
All
spake
,
aspiring
to the
post
.
PRIDE
said
, to gain his private ends,
He
sacrific
'd his
dearest
friends;
Infulted all with manners rude,
And introduc'd ingratitude.
'Twas he infus'd
domestick
hate,
And party
spirit
in the
slate
;
Hop'd they'd
observe
his
mystick
plan,
Destroy
'd all confidence in man;
And
justify
'd his high pretentions,
By caufing envy and diffentions.
INTEMP'RANCE loud, demands the place,
He'd long deceiv'd the human race;
None could
such
right as he maintain,
Disease
and death were in his train.
THEFT next appears to claim the
station
,
E'er
constant
in his dark vocation;
He thought the place might well repay,
The
crime
who labeur'd night and day.
FRAUD own'd (tho' loth to
speak
his
praise
)
He gain'd his point by
secret
ways;
His voice in cities had been heard,
And oft in
senates
been preferr'd!
Yet much
derision
had he borne,
Treated by
honest
fools with
scorn
;
His influence on the
western
shore
Was not
so
great as heretofore:
He own'd each
side
alike
assail'd
Complain'd how
sadly
he was rail'd,
Curst
by the name in ev'ry
street
,
Of Paper, Tendry, Rogue and Cheat:
Yet if
some
honour
should
requite
His labourthings might
still
go right.
MURDER before the
footstool
stood
,
With tatter'd robe
distain
'd in blood.
`And who,' he cry'd, with daring face,
`Denies my title to the place?
`My watchful eyes mankind furvey,
`And
single
out the midnight prey;
`Not cowardlike I meet the foe,
With
footsteps
infecure and
slow
,
`Or
cause
his death by languid
strife
`Boldly this dagger ends his life.
`Give back, ye CRIMES, your claims
resign
`For I demand the
post
as mine.
AV'RICE declar'd his love of gold;
His nation, or
himself
he fold;
He taught the
sin
of PRIDE betimes;
Was
foster
-father of all
crimes:
He pawn'd his life; he
stak
'd his
soul
,
And found employment for the whole:
Acknowledg'd that he gain'd his wealth,
By FRAUD, by MURDER and by STEALTH:
On one
so
useful
in her
cause
,
VICE well might
lavish
due
applause
.
The hagger'd
host
bow low the head,
The
Monster
rofe, and thus
she
said
:
`Ye
ministers
of
VICE, draw near,
`For fame no longer
persevere
;
`No more your various parts
disclose
,
`Men
see
, and hate you all as foes
.
`One yet remains among your crew,
`Then
rise
, SEDUCTION! claim your due.
`Your baleful
presence
quickly parts
`The tie that holds the
happiest
hearts;
`You
rob
what
wealth
can ne'er repay;
`Like
Judas
with a
kiss
betray
:
`Hence come the
starving
, trembling train,
`Who
prostitute
themselves
for gain,
`
Whose
lanquid
visages
impart
`A
smile
, while
anguish
knaws the heart;
`
Whose
steps
decoy unwary youth,
`From honour,
honesty
, and truth,
`Which follow'd 'till too late to mend,
`In ruin, and the gallows end
`Be thine the
post
.
Besides
, who knows
`Where all thy
consequences
close
?
`With thee, SEDUCTION! are ally'd
`HORROUR, DESPAIR and SUICIDE.
`YOU woundbut the
devoted
heart
`Feels not alonethe poignant
smart
:
`YOU woundth' electrick pain extends
`To fathers, mothers,

`MURDER may yet delight in blood,
`And deluge round the
crimson

LETTER XXVI.
MYRA to Mrs. HOLMES.
BOSTON.
In
one of my former letters I
acquainted you that I
suspe
cted my brother
to be in love, and now, Madam, I am
enabled
to tell you with whomthe amiable
Harriot
.
HARRIOT
attended Mrs.
Francis
in her
journey to
Rhodeisland
, and our young hero
has, in her
absence
, been dreaming of his
mistress
; and, in a letter to her has written
a
description
of his
visionary
interview.
Harriot
, with whom I maintain a
constant
correspondence
, and who keeps no
secret
from me,
inclosed
the
verses
in her laft,
L
when lo! the hand writing of
Master
Har-rington
.
I WAS a little mortified that the young
man had kept me in ignorance of his amour
all this time, and this morning determined
upon a little innocent revenge
Tommy
,
said
I, as he entered the room, here is a
piece of poetry, written by an acquaintance
of mineI want your judgment on it
Poetry or rhyme,
answered
he, advancing
towards me, and
casting
his eye on itHe
took the letter and began to readWhy
do you
blush
, young man?
said
I,
Har-riot
is a fine girl.
THIS produced an
eclaircissement
, and as
the matter
must
remain
secret
, for a certain
weighty
reason
, I am to be the
confidante
.
I MUST acknowledge to you, Mrs.
Holmes
,
there is a certain
je ne
sais
quoi
in my amiable
friend, that has always
interested
me in her
favourI have an affection for her which
comes from the heartan affection which I
do not pretend to account forHer
depend-ance
on Mrs.
Francis
hurts meI do not
think this lady is the gentle, complaifant
being, that
she
appears to be in company
To behold
so
fine a girl in
so
disagreeable
a
situation
, might at
first
attract my
commifer-ation
and
esteem
, and a more intimate
know-ledge
of her virtues might have ripened them
into love. Certain it is, however, that whom
I admire as a friend, I could love as a SISTER.
In the feelings of the heart there can be no
dissimulation
.
PLEASE to tell Mr.
Worthy
, he may
con-tinue
to write, and that I will
condescend
to
read his letters.
Farewel!
LETTER XXVII. WORTHY to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
I AM
just
returned from a
melan-choly
excursion
with
Eliza
. I will give you
the
history
of itWe generally walk out
together, but we this time went further than
usual
The morning was calm and
serene
all Nature was
flourishing
, and its
universal
harmony
conspired
to deceive us in the
length of the way.
WHILE we were
pursuing
our walk, our
ears were
struck
with a plaintive,
musical
voice,
singing
a melancholy tune.This,
said
Mrs.
Holmes
,
must
be
Fidelia
the
poor
distra
cted girl was carried off by a
ruf-fian
a few days before her intended marriage,
and her lover, in
despair
, threw
himself
into
the river
Eliza
could
say
no morefor
Fidelia
refumed her melancholy
strain
in the
following words:
TALL rofe the lily's
slender
frame,
It
shed
a glad perfume;
But ah! the cruel
spoiler
came,
And nipt its opening bloom.
Curse
on the cruel
spoiler
's hand
That
stole
thy bloom and fled
Curse
on his handfor thy true love
Is number'd with the dead.
L 2
Poor maiden! like the lily frail,
'Twas all in vain you
strove
;
You heard the
stranger
's tender tale
But where was thy true love?
Thou
wast
unkind and
false
to him,
But he did
constant
prove;
He plunged headlong in the
stream
Farewel, farewel, my love!
'Twas where the river rolls along,
The youth all trembling
stood
,
Opprest
with griefhe
cast
himself
Amidst
the cruel flood.
White o'er his head the billows foam,
And circling eddies move;
Ah! there he finds a watery tomb
Farewel, farewel, my love!
WE advanced towards the place from
whence the
sound
issued
, and
Fidelia
, who
heard our approach, immediately
rose
from
the ground; I was tired,
said
she
, and
sat
down here to
rest
myself
.
SHE was
dressed
in a long white robe, tied
about the
waist
with a pink ribband; her
fine brown hair flowed
loosely
round her
shoulders
In her hand
she
held a number
of wild flowers and weeds, which
she
had
been gathering.
These
,
she
cried, are
to make a
nosegay
for my love. He
hath no
occasion
for it,
said
Eliza
. Yes!
where he lives, cried
Fidelia
, there are
plentyand flowers that never fade tooI
will throw them into the river, and they will
swim
to himthey will go
straight
to him
And what will he do with them? I
asked
.
O!
said
the poor girl as
she
looked
wistfully
on them, and forted them in her hand,
he loves every thing that comes from me
he told me
so
He will be happy to
receive
them, cried
Eliza
Where he is,
said
Fidelia
, is
happiness
and happy are
the flowers that bloom thereand happy
shall
I be, when I go to himalas! I am
very ill nowHe will love you again,
said
Eliza
, when you find him outO
he was very kind, cried
she
, tenderly, he
delighted to walk with me over all
these
fieldsbut now, I am obliged to walk
alone.
Fidelia
drew her hand
across
her cheek, and we wept with her.
I
must
go,
she
said
, I
must
go, and
turned abruptly from us, and left us with
great precipitation.
Farewel!
LETTER XXVIII.
WORTHY to MYRA.
BELLEVIEW.
My
melancholy meditations led
me
yesterday
to the
same
place where I had
seen
the
distra
cted
Fidelia
, and walking down
the hill I again beheld her by the
side
of a
beautiful
spring
Before I could come up to
the place,
she
was gone
she
went
hastily
over the fieldI followed herafter a few
minutes walk, I overtook her, and we both
went on together towards a
small
, neat, farm
house
. An old man was
sitting
at the door
he gave a
sigh
as
she
passed
by him to go
inI
asked
him if
she
was his daughter
Alas!
said
he, my poor child
she
has
been in this
state
of affliction for near a twelve
month. I inquired what
cause
produced
the
loss
of her
senses
He looked down
sorrowfully
the
question
awakened the gloomy
sensations
of
past
evils, the recollection of
which was painful, and opened wounds
afresh
that were not yet healed. She has
lost
her lover, cried the old manthe youth
was the
son
of one of our neighbourstheir
infancy was marked by a peculiar
attachment
to each other. When the young
people
danced together,
Fidelia
was always
the partner of
Henry
as they grew up their
mutual tendernefs ripened into
passionate
affection. They were engaged to each
other, and
Henry
saved
all his little
stock
of
money to begin the world by
himself
. All
the town beheld them with
pleasure
they
wished
them
success
and
happiness
and
from their knowledge of both their
charac-ters
,
were led to hope they would one day
become good members of
society
but
these
hopes are
blasted
, and they now
bestow
the
bitterest
curses
on the wretch who hath
crushed
their expectationswho hath
de-prived
Fidelia
of her
senses
, and
caused
the
death of her lover.
THE gay
Williams
comes among us, and
participates in our
domestick
pastimes
he
singles
out
Fidelia
, and is affiduous in his
at-tentions
to herher little heart is lifted up
but her prudence
rises
superiour
to her
vanity.
Henry
observes
the operations of
Williams
and thinks he
sees
in him a
power-ful
rivalthe unhappy youth becomes
me-lancholy
he
sickens
with
jealousy
the
pleasures
of our country are forgotten by
himhis thoughts are continually
employed
on his
Fidelia
.To complete the
measure
of his
promised
happiness
he
wishes
to call
her his ownhe declares the
desire
of his
soul
Fidelia
pledges her faith. He now
fees the
accomplishment
of all his
wishes
in
reversion
his heart leaps for joybutas
the little paraphernalia is preparing, the
ruffian
hand of the Seducer
dashes
the cup of joy
from their lips
Fidelia
suddenly
disappears
Williams
the ungrateful
Williams
betrays
her to a carriage he had prepared, and
she
is hurried off.
Henry
stands
astonished
wild with grief and
dismay
, he appears
senseless
and confounded.
WHEN the heart is elevated by
strong
expectation
disappointment
and
misfortune
come with redoubled forceTo
receive
pain, when we look for
pleasure
,
penetrates
the very
soul
with accumulated
anguish
.
THE old man
paused
He
endeavoured
to hide a tear that was
stealing
down his
cheekand to check the violence of his
passion
.
I ASKED him how long his daughter was
missing
Not long, he
answered
the
young men, enraged at the
insult
, arm
themselves
and
pursue
the robberthey
overtake him
Williams
is wounded in the
scuffle
, and is carried away bleeding, by his
servant
My daughter is regainedwe
M
thank Heaven for her
restoration
. She
enquires
for her
Henry
alas!
Henry
is no
more! The object of his love had flown from
him, and with her, all the light of his
soul
Darkness
and grief had
encompassed
him
he had no
resource
, no
consolation
, no hope
she
whom his
soul
loved was
stolen
was
wrested
from his embrace. Who was there
to
administer
relief?Who was there to
supply
her
loss
?Not one.The light of
his
reason
now became cloudedhe is
seized
by
despair
, and urged forward by the
torments
of
disappointed
love, he plunges into
the riverto
close
his
sorrows
with his
life.
THE
loss
of
Fidelia
's
senses
followed this
tragical event.
SHE hears the
sate
of her lover and
becomes
petrisied
the idea of her
sorrows
her own agitation and care for her
person
,
are
lost
in the reflection of her lover's death.
A while
she
ravedbut is now
somewhat
restored
, and, as you
see
,the poor maniack
strays
about the fields
harmless
and
inoffenfive
.
THE old man proceeded to inform me of
the death of his wifethe idea of one
misfortune
aroused
in him that of anotheror
rather there was a gradual
progression
in
them, and
consequently
a connexionHe
told me
she
did not long
survive
the death
of
Henry
. O
Charlotte!
he cried, thou
wast
kind and cheerfulvery
pleasant
hast
thou been unto me. I will not
cease
to
regret
thy
loss
, till I meet thee in a better
world.
OUR hearts, continued the old man,
addressing
me, are
loosened
from their
attachment
to this world by repeated
strokes
of misfortune.
Wisely
is it ordered thus.
Every calamity
severs
a
string
from the
heartuntil one
scene
of
sorrow
on the back
of another, matures us for eternityThus
are our affections
estranged
from this
scene
of
misery
. The cord that detains the bird
is
severed
in twoand it
slies
away.
FORMERLY as I
sat
in this placein
the mild
shade
of the eveningwhen I had
returned from my labour and took
Fidelia
on
my knee, how often have I rendered thanks
to Heaven for the
happiness
I enjoyed, and
implored his power to make my child
such
another as
Charlotte
This
sweet
remembrance
yet
swells
and agitates my heart, and
in the
midst
of the
distress
which
surrounds
me, I feel a
consolation
in tracing to you a
feeble
sketch
of the happy times that are
pasted
.
THE old man was
sensibly
affectedhe
delighted to dwell on what his child had
beenhe thought of
those
timesand he
fighed when he
contrasted
them with the
present
.
IN her
disordered
state
, continued he,
she
knows me not as a fatherI
spread
my
morsel
before her, and
she
slies
from it
she
forgets the
sound
of my voice
she
is no
longer unto me as a daughter. She who
hath
so
often
said
,
she
would
support
me
with her arm, and lead me about, when I
should
be old and decripedto her I call,
but
she
returns me no
answer
. Is not the
cause
of my woe, a melancholy
instance
of
the baleful art of the SEDUCER?She is
deprived of her
reason
, and knows not the
weight of her
misery
; and I am doubly
burdened with her affliction, and the
accumulated
misfortune of immature
decripitude
.
SEDUCTION is a crime, I
observed
,
that nothing can be
said
to palliate or
excuse
.
AND wo to him, added the old man,
who
shall
endeavour to extenuate it
They have taken away my
staff
continued
he,
raising
a look of imploring mercy to
Heaven
,
while a trembling tear rolled from his
swollen
eye,
They have taken away my
staff
in my old age
.
FREELY did my heart
share
in the
sorrows
of the good old manwhen I left him,
I prayed Heaven to
compassionate
his
diftress
and
as I bent my
pensive
step
towards
Belleview
, I had
leisure
to animadvert on the
fatal tendency of SEDUCTION.
Adies!
