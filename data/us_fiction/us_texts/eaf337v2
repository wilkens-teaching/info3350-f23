VOL. II. B
REDWOOD.
CHAPTER X.
They're here that kens and here that disna ken,
The wimpled meaning o' your unco tale,
Whilk soon will make a noise o'er muir and dale.
Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd
.
Those
only who have observed the
magical effect produced upon a young
lady by the presence of a candidate for
her favour, whom she deems it worth
her efforts to obtain or retain, can have
an adequate notion of the change wrought
on Caroline Redwood since the arrival
of the Westalls. Instead of the listless,
sullen girl, who yawned away her days
in discontent or apathy, she became
spirited
,
active, and good-humoured. Even
her interest in the concerns of Ellen
Bruce, and her suspicions of that artless
girl's designs, were suspended in the
ardour of her present pursuit, and she
seemed to think of nothing and to care
for nothing but how she should secure
the triumph of her vanity. Every one
noticed the change; (excepting Ellen,
who had of late almost wholly
withdrawn
from the family circle) indeed, it
was so manifest that Miss Deborah, who
had taken a decided dislike to Caroline,
and who was rather remarkable for the
inveteracy of her opinions, was heard to
say, that since the girl's sweetheart
had come, she was as bright as a
September
day after the fog was lifted; but
for her part she liked to see people have
sunshine within them like Ellen. This
declaration was made by Miss Debby in
an imprudently loud tone of voice, as
she stood at a window gazing on Mr.
Redwood's carriage that had been
ordered
for an afternoon's drive. Mr.
Redwood
,
Caroline, and Mrs. Westall were
B 2
already in the carriage, and Charles
Westall had returned to the parlour in
quest of some article Mr. Redwood had
forgotten; while he was looking for it,
Deborah's comment fell on his ear, and
probably gave a new direction to his
thoughts, for during the ride Caroline
rallied him on his extraordinary
pensiveness
;
and finally perceiving that his
gravity resisted all her efforts to dissipate
it, she proposed that if he had not lost
the use of his limbs as well as of his
tongue, he should alight from the
carriage
with her and walk to a cottage, to
which they perceived a direct path
through a field, while the carriage
approached
by the high road which ran
along the lake shore and was circuitous.
Westall assented rather with politeness
than eagerness; but when he was alone
with Caroline, when she roused all her
powers to charm him, he yielded to the
influence of her beauty and her vivacity.
Never had she appeared so engaging
never so beautifulthe afternoon was
delicioustheir path ran along the skirts
of an enchanting woodits soft shadows
fell over them, the birds poured forth
their melody; and, in short, all nature
conspired to stimulate the lover's
imagination
and to quicken his sensibility.
Charles forgot the sage resolutions he
had made to withhold his declaration till
he had satisfied certain doubts that had
sometimes obtruded on him, that all in
Caroline was not as fair and lovely as it
seemed; he forgot Miss Deborah's hint
forgot every thing but the power and
the presence of his beautiful companion,
and only hesitated for language to
express
what his eyes had already told her.
At this moment both his and Miss
Redwood's
attention was withdrawn from
themselves to a little girl who appeared
at the door of the cottage, from which
they were now not many yards distant.
On perceiving them she bounded over
the door step, then stopped, put up her
hand to shade her eyes from the sun,
and gazed fixedly on them for a moment,
then again sprang forward, again
stopped
,
covered her eyes with both her
hands, threw herself at full length on the
grass, laid her ear to the ground and
seemed for a moment to listen intently;
she then rose, put her apron to her eyes
and appeared to be weeping, while she
retraced her way languidly to the
cottage
.
Caroline and Westall, moved by
the same impulse, quickened their pace,
and in a few moments reached the
cottage
door, to which a woman had been
attracted by the sobs of the child, and
was expostulating with her in an earnest
tone. God help us, Peggy, you'll just
ruin all if you go on in this way; she
paused on perceiving that the child had
attracted the attention of the strangers;
and in reply to Westall's asking what
ailed the little girl, she said, it's just
her simplicity, Sir; but if you and the
lady will condescend to walk into my
poor place here, I will tell you all about
it, or Peggy shall tell it herself, for when
she gets upon it her tongue runs faster
than mine: but bless me, here comes a
grand coachlook up, Peggy, you never
saw a real coach in your life. Peggy
now let fall the apron with which she
had covered her facea face if not
beautiful, full of feeling and intelligence.
She seemed instantly to forget her
affliction
,
whatever it was, in the pleasure of
gazing on the spectacle of the real coach.
Ah, aunt Betty, she exclaimed, it
is the grand sick gentleman that is
staying
at Mr. Lenox's. The carriage drew
up to the door, and Mrs. Westall and
Mr. Redwood, attracted by the
uncommonly
neat appearance of the cottage,
alighted and followed Caroline and
Charles, who had already entered it.
The good woman, middle-aged and of a
cheerful countenance, was delighted with
the honour conferred on her, bustled
around to furnish seats for her guests
shook up the cushion of a rocking chair
for Mr. Redwood, and made a thousand
apologies for the confusion and dirt of
her house, which had the usual if not the
intended effect of calling forth
abundance
of compliments on its perfect order
and neatness. And now, Peggy, she
said, as soon as they were all quietly
seated, take the pitcher and bring some
cold water from the spring, that's what
the poor have, thank God, as good as
the rich, and it is all we have to offer.
The little girl obeyed, and as soon as she
was out of hearing, the woman turned to
Westall. It was your wish, Sir, to
know what ailed the child; the poor
thing has just got the use of her
eyesight
,
and she has been expecting some
one that she loves better than all the
world; and when she saw this young
lady with you, she thought it was her
friendthough to be sure she is shorter
than this lady; but then Peggy, poor
thing, does not see quite right yet, and
then when she is puzzled she just lies
down to the ground as you saw her, for
that was her way to listen, and she knows
Miss Ellen's step, for as light as it is,
when my poor ear can't hear a sound.
How did she become blind, my good
woman, and how did she recover her
sight? asked Westall.
It is a long story, Sir: when she was
one year old, she laid in the measles, and
her mother dying at the same time, and
I sick of a fever, and the child, God
forgive
me, was neglected, and there came
a blind over her eyes, and shut them up
in darkness. Not all darkness, said
the little heroine of the story, who
reentered
with the water, you know,
aunt Betty, I could see a glimmer of
sunshine
.
Yes, and that it was that gave
the doctor hopes of her. No, no,
interrupted the child, it was Miss Ellen
that gave the doctor hopes.
Lord bless her, continued the
woman, smiling, Peggy thinks there's
B 3
nothing good done in the world, but
Miss Ellen does it, and to be sure she
has been an angel to Peggy.
And how, asked Mr. Redwood,
whose interest in Peggy's history seemed
much augmented since the mention of
Miss Ellen, how came Miss Bruce to
know your child?
God brought them together, Sir; it
was his own work; but the child is not
mine, her poor mother lies in the
graveyard
there in the village, far from all her
own people, for we are from old England,
Sir. My sister, poor Fanny, was a wild
thing, the youngest of ten of us, and I
the oldest. My mother died and left
her a baby in my arms; and she was like
my own, and we all, and father more
than all, petted her, and when she was
sixteen, she had just her own way, and
married a young soldier lad of our
village
,
and my father turned her from his
door, and would not hear to forgiving
her. But I, Lord help me! I had no
right not to forgive her; and so I came
over to Canada with her when her
husband's
regiment was ordered there. I
had a little money of my own, and we
paid our own way, but when that was
gone, our distresses and hardships threw
her in the consumption. Her husband
got into bad company, deserted and came
off to the States; we followedshe with
the babyPeggy that isin her arms.
We persuaded her husband to take this
bit of a place, but he soon left us, and,
as I told you before, Fanny died, and
left me alone in the world, as you may
say, with Peggyand she blind; but, Sir,
I have always been of a contented
disposition
,
and I meant to be resigned to
whatever it pleased the Lord to send
upon me; but I must own, when I found
Peggy was blind, and the doctors told
me nothing could be done for her, I had
my match. It was the bitterest sorrow
I ever felt when life was spared, but I
thought to myself, what can't be cured
must be endured; so I went to work.
The Lord has blessed us, and Peggy and
I have lived these six years as
comfortable
and as contented may be as those
that are richer, and seem to be happier.
No doubt, no doubt, my good
woman
,
said Mr. Redwood, struck with
admiration of the simple creature's
practical
philosophy; but you have told us
so much of your story that you must give
us the rest.
Yes, yes, said little Peggy, do,
aunt Betty, tell them about Miss Ellen,
they'll like to hear that best of all: now
don't go away, said she, turning to
Caroline
,
who had risen from her chair, and
was walking towards the door.
I am not going away, child, she
answered, pettishly, I prefer standing
at the door.
It is five weeks to-morrow,
continued
the narrator, since I first saw
Miss Ellen; it was the very morning after
young Mr. Allen's funeral. I saw her
that morning and the next sitting on
that rock by the elm tree yonder, ladies;
she had a pencil in her hand, and a big
book on her lap, and a paper on it; and
the second morning Peggy heard her
humming some songs to herself, and she
crept close to her: the silly thing would
any time leave her breakfast for an end
of a song. I saw the young lady noticed
Peggy, and then I made bold to walk
up to her; and will you believe me,
ladies! she had been picturing on her
paper this little hut and the half withered
tree, and that old bench with my
washtub
turned up on it, and my old cow, as
she stands eating her morning mess, and
Peggy stroking her! and I could not but
ask her why she did not choose to draw
out some of the nice houses in the village
with two chimnies, and a square roof to
them, and a pretty fence to the
dooryard
,
and the straight tall poplars; but
she smiled, and said `this suited her
fancy better;' and then she began
talking
to me of Peggy, and when she found
she was quite blind, she just laid down
her pencil and her book and all, and took
the child in her lap, and said, `something
must be done for her;' and when she
said so, the tears stood in her blue eyes;
and God knows, I never saw tears so
becoming; and from that time, ladies,
she came every morning, and sate here
three or four hours, teaching Peggy to
sew, and learning her hymns and songs.
Caroline, Caroline, do you hear
that? asked Mr. Redwood, impetuously.
Lord, papa, I am not deafcertainly
I hear.
Go on, good woman, said Mr.
Redwood
.
The child's quickness, Sir,
continued
the aunt, seemed a miracle to
me; for, God forgive me, I had never
thought of her learning anything. Peggy,
get those bags you made that Miss Ellen
said you might sell.
The child instantly produced the bags,
which were made of pieces of calico very
neatly sewn together. Caroline
interrupted
the story while she bargained
with the little girl for the bags, for which
she paid her most munificently.
The aunt seemed more sensible of the
extent of Miss Redwood's generosity
than the child, for she was voluble in
her thanks; and then proceeded to say
that Miss Ellen, not satisfied with doing
so much, brought Doctor Bristol to look
at Peggy's eyes. Doctor Bristol, she
said, had come to live in Eton since
she had given up Peggy's eyes as quite
gone, and therefore she had never shown
the child to him. But Doctor Bristol
had learned some new fashioned ways
that other doctors in the country knew
nothing about, and as soon as he looked
at the child, he said one of the eyes might
be restored. Then poor Peggy was so
frightened with the thought of an
operation
,
and I could do nothing with her,
for I had always let her have her own
way; for who, ladies, could have the
heart to cross a blind child? but Miss
Ellen, God bless her, could always make
her mind without crossing her, for she
loves Miss Ellen better than any thing
on earth, or in heaven either, I fear me;
and she would liken her to strawberries
and roses, and every thing that was most
pleasant to the senses the poor thing had
leftand she would say that her voice
was sweeter than the music of the birds,
or the sound of the waters breaking on
the shore, when a gentle breeze came
over the lake of a still evening, for that
was the sound she loved best of all, and
would listen to it sometimes for an hour
together without speaking or moving.
It seemed that Miss Redwood's
patience
could no longer brook the minute
and excursive style of the narrator, as
she proposed to Mrs. Westall in a
whisper
,
that they should cut the woman's
never-ending story short and pursue their
ride. Mrs. Westall acquiesced, with a
`just as you please, my dear;' but Mr.
Redwood, guessing the purport of his
daughter's whisper, interposed with a
request in a low voice, that she would
not prolong their delay by interrupting
the good woman's story, as the pain in
his arm warned him that it was time for
him to return; then turning to the aunt,
he asked her how she brought the girl
finally to consent to the operation?
Oh, it was Miss Ellen that made her
consent, and she would only do it by
promising that she would stay by her and
hold her head. God knows I could not
have done it, well as I love her, to have
saved her eyes, for I was all in a shiver
when I saw the doctor fix her by that
window, and Miss Ellen stood behind
her, and Peggy leaned her head back on
to Miss Ellen's breast, and one of Miss
Ellen's hands was on the child's forehead,
and the other under her chin, and she
looked, God bless her, as white as
marble
,
and as beautiful as an angel. I had
but a glance at them, for when the doctor
took out his long needle I covered my
eyes till I heard them say it was all over,
and Peggy had not made a movement or
a groan. Miss Ellen bade me not to
speak yet, and the bandage was put over
the child's eyes, and she was laid there
on the bed, and Miss Ellen motioned
to me to go out with her, and as I
stepped
from the door, she sunk like a dying
person into my arms; but still it seemed
she could only think of Peggy, for she
put up her hand for a sign to me to be
quiet, and then the breath seemed quite
gone out of her. I laid her on the turf
and fetched some cold water, and she
soon came to herself, and bade me say
nothing of it to the doctor; and she came
in again and told the doctor she should
come back in the evening and sit the
night with Peggy, for she would trust no
one else for the first night, for the doctor
said all depended on keeping her quiet;
and the last word she said, was to beg he
would not tell any of the family at Mr.
Lenox's that she was coming here, for
they, she said, fancied she was not well,
and would not permit it. At this
simple
explanation of the absence which
Caroline had placed in a suspicious light,
her father turned on her a look full of
meaningshe blushed deeply, but
neither
spoke, and the aunt proceeded.
All went on well to the third day,
and then Miss Ellen came with leave to
take off the bandage, and she asked
Peggy what she wished most in the world
to see. Oh you, you, Miss Ellen, she
said; and then the dear young lady stood
before her, and took off the bandage;
and then, bless you, ladies, her piercing
scream of joy when the light touched
her eyeoh!I heard my father curse
poor FannyI saw her die in a strange
land; but never any thing went so deep
into my heart as that scream. I fell on
my knees, and heard nothing and saw
nothing, till I felt Peggy's arms round
my neck, and heard her say, `Oh aunt,
I see herI see you.'
Many more eloquent tales have
produced
less sensation than the simple
story of this good aunt. Mrs. Westall
wiped the tears from her eyesCaroline
put her handkerchief to hersMr.
Redwood's
speaking face showed that other
and deeper feelings than compassion and
sympathy had been awakened; and
Charles, who had drawn the little girl
close to him, asked a hundred questions
in relation to Miss Bruce, and expressed
by his caresses his pleasure in her simple
expressions of gratitude and love.
The party now took a very kind leave
of Peggy and her aunt, and returned
home; all in rather a contemplative frame
of mind. Mr. Redwood once turned
abruptly to his daughter, and asked her
if she remembered the quotation he had
made to her, that the `simplest
characters
sometimes baffle all the art of
decipherers
?'
She remembered it, she said, but
she thought simple characters were not
worth deciphering. After they reached
home, the ceremony of tea came in aid
of Caroline's efforts, and changed the
train of association, and seconded by
Mrs. Westall, she succeeded in exciting
a more lively tone of spirits in the party;
but fate seemed determined not to
suspend
its persecutions, for after tea, when
she seemed quite to have forgotten the
incidents of the ride, and her gaiety had
arrived to its usual pitch, it was suddenly
checked by Miss Deborah, who came
into the parlour and informed Mr.
Redwood
that Billy Raymond, the lame
boy that supported his old mother by
fishing, had called to see if the stranger
gentleman would have the generosity to
pay him the damages for his
fishingtackle
,
that Miss Redwood had lost at
the time of her frolic in his canoe?
This was the first time Mr. Redwood
had heard any hint of the canoe
adventure
,
and he inquired into the
particulars
.
Caroline carelessly detailed them,
and Mr. Redwood ascertaining from
Deborah the amount of the boy's loss,
gave her a sum for the applicant which
she deemed a most liberal compensation;
for shaking the silver in her hand, while
her eye glistened with an honest joy at
the good fortune of her proteg
Thank'e, thank'e, squire, said she,
this is profit, and no loss to Billthe
lad is a worthy lad, and thank the Lord
his bread has not been cast on the
waters
without coming to him again. It is
well, young folks, she continued,
turning
her eyes on Miss Redwood and
Westall, it is well when the heart and
the purse of a gentleman fall in company
here, and she opened her hand and
surveyed the glittering coins, here is
what will make a young heart leap with
joyand an old one too, and that is not
so easy a matterand after all, squire,
it is but a drop from your full bucket.
Oh, you rich ones might be god-like on
the earth if ye would.
And how, Miss Debby? inquired
Mr. Redwood, pleased with her
earnestness
;
if you will furnish me an easy
rule I may possibly adopt it.
Make the cause of the poor thine
own: the rule is not overly easy, squire,
as maybe you have found. It is a hard
tug to keep up with them scripter rules,
they are all a-head of us.
Miss Deborah's sagacity or
experience
,
observed Westall to Mr.
Redwood
,
has led her to one of the most
satisfactory proofs of the divine origin
of our religion. Mr. Redwood averted
his eyes, knit his brow, and adjusted
the sling of his arm, while Caroline
putting
up her fan to shelter herself from
her father's observation, whispered,
Lord, Mr. Westall, do you not know
that papa is an infidel?
Your father?
Oh yesit is indeed quite shocking,
how far the sudden gravity of Westall's
face would have prompted her to
proceed
in her lamentations, is uncertain,
for her attention was called by her father,
who willing to divert the conversation
from the channel into which it had fallen,
asked her why she had never mentioned
the affair of the canoe to him?
Oh, I quite forgot it, Sir, she replied,
in my pleasure at seeing Mrs. Westall
and her son, her eyes added, as she sent
a sparkling glance to Charles. Her
reply
did not appear entirely to satisfy
Westall, even with the flattering
appendage
to which her kind look had
supplied
;
after musing a moment he said,
I hope Miss Redwood has not
forgotten
her friend's presence of mind on
that occasion?
Miss Bruce's?  certainly not
though it deprived me of the romance
of being rescued by you, Mr. Westall,
which you know would have been quite
an incident for a novel.
I don't know about incidents, said
Debby, who was arrested as she was
leaving the room by the allusion to Ellen,
but I think if any body had saved me
from the accident of being drowned or
ducked, I should not have left it to
other folks to tell of it.
There was one unsuspected and most
unwilling auditor of this conversation
Ellen Bruce. She had been indulging
herself with the refreshment of a short
walk, and was just re-entering the door,
and lingering to gaze on the dewy
landscape
glittering in the moon-beams, when
her ear caught Charles Westall's inquiry
in relation to herself: she was awkwardly
situated, for she could not advance
without
being observed, nor remain without
being an involuntary listener to a
conversation
that seemed now to have turned
upon herself. While she was hesitating,
Mr. Redwood inquired of Debby why
Miss Bruce latterly confined herself so
much to Mrs. Allen's room?
VOL. II. C
Why, said Deborah, the fact is,
that the old lady is broke to pieces with
her troubles, and the moment Ellen is
out of her sight she moans for her like a
child whimpering for its mother: we all
try to spell her, but none of us can do
any thing right but Ellen: it is past all
belief what she does for the old ladyit
is enough to wear out the strength of
Sampson. I talk to Mrs. Allen, but she
is quite past hearing to reason, though
there was never a nicer reasonabler
woman
than she has been in her day.
It is quite surprising, observed
Caroline
,
languidly to Mrs. Westall, what
labours these New England women
perform
.
Surprising indeed, echoed Mrs.
Westall, but it's all in habit, my dear.
New-England womenhabit!
exclaimed
Deborah; I'll tell you what
it is not being born here or there, it is
not habit; it is not strength of limb, but
here, and she struck her hand against
her heart, here is what gives Ellen
Bruce strength and patience.
There was energy if not eloquence in
Deborah's manner, and Charles Westall,
who had listened to the conversation
from the beginning, with an interest that
had manifestly nettled Caroline, inquired
what relation Mrs. Allen bore to Miss
Bruce? None, replied Deborah,
and then seeming suddenly to recollect
that the fisherman was awaiting her, she
left the room.
This is an uncommon devotion on
the part of Miss Bruce, said Westall;
but after what we have heard this
afternoon
it cannot surprise usthere is
something
singularly pure and lovely in her
whole expression and manner, in perfect
unison with her disinterested conduct.
She is indeed quite a genteel young
woman, observed Mrs. Westall. Pray,
Miss Redwood, how is she connected
with the Lenoxes?
Not at all as far as I can ascertain,
C 2
replied Caroline. She seems to be
quite as mysterious a personage as the
man in the iron mask. I have tried in
vain to find out whether she has, or ever
had, father or mother, brethren or sisters
and I have finally come to the
conclusion
,
that she is, as you know, papa, old
Colonel Linston used to call such people,
of the Melchisedeck family.
There was a harshness, a levity
bordering
on impiety in Miss Redwood's
reply; it sent a sudden light in upon
Charles Westall's mind. He had been
amusing himself with drawing and
undrawing
the strings of Caroline's reticule
he threw it aside, not with that
lover-like
manner that resembles so much the
profound reverence with which the
priest handles the consecrated vessels,
but very carelesslyand left the room.
In the passage he met Ellen, who on his
approach had darted forward in the hope
of avoiding him. It was impossible
and it was apparent that she had
overheard
the conversationher face was
flushed and her manner troubledher
eye met Westall's: a single glance
intimated
the suffering of the one and the
indignant feeling of the othertheir fine
spirits had been kindled by the same
sparkit was one of those moments
when the soul sends its bright
illuminations
to the face, and does not need the
intervention of language. Ellen's first
impulse had been to pass to her own
apartment, but Westall's look had
changed the current of her feelings
such is the power of sympathy. Stay
one moment, Mr. Westall, said she,
hastily entering Mr. Redwood's
apartment
,
while Westall paused at the
door.
Her appearance was electrifying
Caroline
rose from her seat, Mr. Redwood
exclaimed, good heavens! and Mrs.
Westall signed out, what a pity!
Miss Redwood, said Ellen, I have
not come to excuse my listening, that
was involuntary, but as far as I am able,
to shield the memory of my mother from
your reckless insinuations. The word
mother, seemed to choke her; a
sudden
faintness came over her, and she
clung for support to the side of the
easychair
on which Mr. Redwood was sitting:
after a moment's struggle with her
feelings
,
the blood that had retreated to her
heart flowed again to her cheeks, and she
went on:
Miss Redwood, it is true I am a
solitary
being in this world, but I have not
sought to wrap myself in mystery; I
hoped the obscurity of my condition
would shelter me from observation and
curiosityit has notthere may be
mystery in my brief story, but there is
no disgrace. My mother died while I
was still an infant. I only know that
my father survived herand that he
washer husband. Here Ellen's voice
quite failed her, but after a moment's
pause she proceeded with tolerable
composure
.
This was her last solemn
declaration. The proofs of her marriage
and other private documents are in my
hands, in a locked casket. It was my
mother's dying injunction that it should
not be opened till a period arrived,
which she named. I have guarded it,
she added, clasping her hands and raising
her fine eyes, as the Israelites guarded
the ark of the living God. The time is
now not far distant when I am at liberty
to examine its contentsto explore my
own history.
But, my God! interrupted Mr.
Redwood, Miss BruceEllenmy
poor childhave you quietly complied
with so strange, so arbitrary a request?
I never heard any thing so
unaccountable
,
so ridiculous, exclaimed
Caroline
.
Nor I, said Mrs. Westall;
it is indeed inexplicable.
Westall said nothing: his eyes were
rivetted with intense eagerness on Ellen,
who replied, can it be inexplicable to
you, Mrs. Westall, who have a devoted
son, to you, Miss Redwood, who can
render a daily service to your parent, that
I should hold sacred and dear the only
act of filial duty that remains to me?
You are too scrupulous, Miss Bruce,
said Mr. Redwood. It cannot be your
duty to comply with so unreasonable, so
irrational a restriction: you may have a
parent living, to whom your filial piety
might be of some avail while you are
rendering this fanciful homage to her
who is insensible and unknowing as the
clods of the valley.
I do not believe it, Sir! replied
Ellen with impetuosity. My mother
seems always near to me; I hear her
voice, I feel her influence in every event
of my life; why she imposed this
restriction
on me, I know not, but that it had
a sufficient cause I may trust to the
tenderness
of a dying mother's heart.
Charles Westall had listened with
breathless interest; he now advanced
involuntarily, and seizing Ellen's hand,
admirable being! he exclaimed, your
enthusiasm cannot be taken from you
persevereand, he added, in a softened
and tremulous voice, God shield you
from the shafts of the careless, the cruel,
or the envious.
Ellen certainly felt a glow of gratitude
and delight that there was one who
perfectly
understood her: such sympathies
are well compared to the perfect accords
of fine instruments. She had hardly
uttered
a fervent thank you, Mr. Westall,
before a sudden feeling of the
awkwardness
of her conspicuous situation came
over her;her natural timidity had been
controlled by stronger feelings, but now
yielding to it, she abruptly left the room
to seek the shelter of her own
apartment
.
Westall's last words to Ellen were still
ringing in Caroline's ears. I trust,
Sir, said she, addressing herself to him,
that you did not mean to do me the
C 3
honour to class me among the `careless,
cruel, or envious?'
Oh no, my sweet Caroline,
exclaimed
Mrs. Westall, how can you
ask such a question: he did not indeed
you did not, my sonof course you
could not?
Westall did not second his mother's
earnest defence; he merely said coldly,
that he hoped Miss Redwood was not
conscious of deserving to be so classed.
Lord bless me!no, replied
Caroline
,
I had not thought of hurting the
girl's feelings; who could have dreamed
that she was listening at the door? But
you know the old proverb, Mrs. Westall,
`listeners never hear any good of
themselves
.'
That is too often true, my love,
replied Mrs. Westall.
Mother! exclaimed Charles
Westall
,
in a tone that savoured of reproach,
but had still more of grief than
resentment
in it; and then unable to endure
any longer his mother's sycophancy, and
perhaps unwilling to expose his own
emotion, he left the room.
Shame on you, Caroline! said her
father.
Now really, interposed Mrs.
Westall
,
I do not see that Caroline is at
all in fault: how could she divine that
Miss Bruce was within hearing?
indeed
,
my dear Sir, it was mere pleasantry
on her part. It is a pity Miss Bruce,
who appears so amiable, should tell such
an incredible story; no one can believe
it, you know, unless it be Charles. It is
just like him to be taken with such
romance
;
it was my dear husband's
greatest
fault; but I own, Caroline, I am
shocked at Charles's inadvertence; I am
sure it was unintentional.
It is quite indifferent to me, whether
it was or not, replied Caroline, pouting,
and evidently far enough from the stoical
feeling she professed. Mrs. Westall
perceived that this was not a propitious
moment, and whispered to Caroline that
Charles should do penance by going
home at an hour so much earlier than
usual, she took her leave, and returned
to the village with her son. This was
the first time that their return had not
been animated by a conversation about
Miss Redwood. This evening her name
was not mentionedneither spoke of
the scene at the cottage, nor of Ellen's
extraordinary disclosure. They
mutually
understood that their feelings did
not harmonize, and both maintained
silence. When they parted for the night,
Charles kissed his mother, as was his
custom, tenderly; and as he closed the
door she heard him sigh deeply. She
regretted that she had pained him, but
she thought it a pity that he had such
peculiar feelings
.
CHAPTER XI.
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
Two Gentlemen of Verona
.
As
soon as the Westalls were gone,
Caroline rose to leave her father's room.
Stop for one moment, my child, said
he, I hope that the experience of this
day and evening has taught you, if not
to be more generous in your judgments,
to be more careful in the expression of
them. I think you cannot fail to learn
this lesson from the story of the blind
child, which has furnished the solution
to those mysterious morning walks, and
that more mysterious night's absence
which perplexed you so much, while you
had nothing else to employ your thoughts
upon.
Yes, Sir, that riddle is read; but
Miss Bruce has been so good as to give
out another, which even you may be
puzzled to solve.
I shall not make the effort, Caroline.
I entreat you to atone by your attentions
to Miss Bruce for your unjust suspicions,
and for your rudeness this evening;
common justice requires that you
should do so; and besides, I can assure
you, it will not be an easy matter to efface
the impression that your unfortunate
remarks
in relation to her have made on
Westall's mind.
I care not, Sir, whether they are
effaced or not, replied Caroline,
sullenly
.
Pursue your own way then, Miss
Redwood. I shall not attempt to guide
you.
Thank you, Sir, replied the
daughter
in a cool sarcastic tone which she
could sometimes assume; and then
wishing
her father a good night, she retired
to her own apartment in a state of mind
resembling that of a petted child
deprived
of its play-things.
She was surprised to find that Ellen,
who had of late been constantly with
Mrs. Allen, was already in her room.
Ellen, believing that Caroline was still
occupied with her guests, had taken her
precious casket from one of her drawers,
had placed it on the window-ledge, and
was sitting in a deep reverie with her
cheek leaning on it, when Caroline's
entrance startled and somewhat
disconcerted
her.
We ought not perhaps to draw aside
the veil and disclose her secret
meditations
.
It is better to appeal to the
experience
of other young ladies to determine
whether it is not probable that the
thoughts of Westall, and of the
animated
interest he had expressed for her, had
not some part in her reverie, and whether
the pleasure he had awakened did not
more than counterbalance the pain
Caroline
had inflicted. There was a
newlyfallen
tear on the box which would not
perhaps justify such a conclusion, but
then her face was so bright and peaceful,
that a malignant spirit might have shrunk
in despair from the attempt to cast a
shadow over it. She rose at Caroline's
entrance to replace the box in the drawer.
Ah, said Caroline, that is your
precious
casketis it, Miss Bruce? pray
allow me to look at it. She took it
from Ellen's hand, and carelessly
shaking
it, said, it is quite light, there is
something rattles thoughshould it be
a miniature? Lord! I would open it,
perhaps the painting will be spoiledI
should like of all things to know whether
it is a hoaxnow do not look so like a
tragedy-queenall I mean is that it may
have been a way your mother adopted
to save your feelingsafter all, perhaps
it is nothing, it is not larger than one of
my jewel cases.
It contains
all
my jewels, Miss
Redwood
;
permit me to take it, replied
Ellen, with some emotion; for she could
no longer endure to see that handled and
discussed with so much levity, which she
had never touched but with a sentiment
resembling religious awe.
While Ellen replaced the box in the
drawer, Caroline watched her, saying at
the same time, (for she was displeased at
Ellen's manner of resuming it) I
cannot
have the slightest curiosity about the
contents of your box, of course, Miss
Bruce; but if they were as important to
me as they are to you, I should not
hesitate
:
it is quite silly to suppose there
would be any harm in just taking a peep.
My mind is entirely at rest on the
subject, replied Ellen. There are
feelings, Miss Redwood, that can control
curiosityeven the most natural and
reasonable curiosity. I am sorry that
my poor concerns have been obtruded on
your notice, but since they have been,
the greatest favour you can do me now
is to forget them; then bidding Caroline
good night, she returned to Mrs. Allen.
`Forget them,' Caroline could not;
the demon of curiosity had taken
possession
of her mind. She had suffered
injurious thoughts of Ellen, till she had
come to consider her as an enemy, of
whom it was right to take any advantage.
Her self-importance had been mortified
by the deference paid to Ellen by the
Lenoxes; her self-love offended by her
father's excessive admiration. Caroline
had the passions of a strong character,
and the habits of a weak one. In her
idleness her thoughts had brooded over
Ellen's conduct, till she had magnified
the most trivial circumstances into a
ground of alarm or anxiety; but since
the arrival of Charles Westall she had
almost forgotten her, and quite forgotten
her silly fancy of the danger of what she
called a `sentimental affair' between
Ellen and her father. The events of the
day and evening had thrown a strong
light on her rival, and cast her quite into
the shade: this was enough to relume
the fires of envy in Caroline's bosom, if
they were not already kindled by the
interest Westall had manifested in Ellen.
A most convenient opportunity now
offered to gratify her curiosity, perhaps
to confirm her malicious conjectures. It
was possible that the key to one of her
trinket cases might open Ellen's box;
there could be no harm in trying just to
see if one would suit. She drew out the
drawer in which she had seen Ellen
replace
her casket, and then paused for a
momentbut, `c'est le premier pas qui
cote; the first wrong step taken, or
resolved on, the next is easy and almost
certain. She carried the box to the
light, found a key that exactly fitted, and
then the gratification could not be
resisted
.
She opened the boxa miniature laid
on the top of it. Caroline started at the
first glance as if she had seen a spectre
she took it out and examined ita name
legibly written on the reverse of the
picture confirmed her first impressions.
She replaced it in the boxshe would
have given worlds that she had never
seen itbut the bold, bad deed, was
done; and, `past who can recall, or done
undo?' After pacing the room for a
few moments in agitation of mind
bordering
on distraction, she returned to the
examination of the box: there was in it
a letter directed `To my child.'It was
unsealed, unless a tress of beautiful hair
which was bound around it might be
called a seal. There was also a
certificate
of the marriage of Ellen's mother to
the original of the picture. Caroline's
first impulse was to destroy the records:
she went to the window, threw up the
sash, and prepared to give Ellen's
treasure
to the disposition of the windsbut
as she unbound the lock of hair that she
might reduce the letter to fragments, it
curled around her hand, and awakened
a feeling of awe and superstition. She
paused; she was familiar with folly, but
not with crime; she had not virtue
enough to restore Ellen's right, nor
hardihood
enough to annihilate the proof of
it: a feeble purpose of future restitution
dawned in her mindthe articles might
be safely retained in her own keeping
future circumstances should decide their
destinyher grandmother
ought
to see
them. This last consideration fixed her
wavering mind, and she proceeded to
make her arrangements with the caution
that conscious guilt already inspired.
She let fall the window-curtains, secured
herself from interruption by placing the
scissors over the latch of the door, and
then refolded the letter, and carefully
removed the miniature from its setting,
tore the name from the back of it, and
placed it with the hair, the letter, and
the certificate, in a box of her own, which
she securely deposited at the bottom of
one of her trunks. In order to avoid a
suspicion that might arise in Ellen's
mind, should she miss the sound of the
miniature, Caroline prudently restored
the setting to the box, and then locked
and replaced it in the drawer.
For a moment she felt a glow of
triumph, that the result of her
investigation
had made her the mistress of
Ellen's destiny; but this was quickly
succeeded by a deep feeling of
mortification
,
a consciousness of injustice and
degradation, and a fearful apprehension
of the future;even at this moment,
who would not rather have been the
innocent
Ellen, spoiled of the object of
years, of patient waiting and intense
expectation
,
than the selfish, ruthless
Caroline
!who
would not rather have been
the injured than the injurer!
Caroline endeavoured to compose
herself
before she summoned her servant,
for she already shrunk from the eye of
an obsequious menialso surely do fear
and shame follow guilt. When Lilly
came, in obedience to her call, and
entering
,
exclaimed, the Lord pity us!
Miss Cary, you are as pale as a ghost,
and all in a tremble,do let me speak to
Mistress Lenox. Caroline replied, no,
no, Lilly, I am only shivering with the
horrid air from the lake: mind your own
affairs and undress me, and do not leave
my bed-side till you see I am quite fast
asleep. These terrible cold damp
evenings
at the north make one so wakeful
and restless!
The succeeding morning Charles
Westall
came as usual with his mother to Mr.
Lenox's. On their way Mrs. Westall,
assiduous to gratify her favourite, had
lingered to gather some wild
honeysuckles
for her, saying at the same time
to her son, that those beautiful and
fragrant flowers were emblematical of
Caroline. Charles made no reply; but
he thought that though the beauty of the
flowers might be emblematical of
Caroline
,
their fragrance was a truer emblem
of that virtue which sends sweet incense
to heaven, and is to beauty what the
perfume
is to the flower. As he proceeded
forward, at a sudden turn of the road he
caught a glimpse of Miss Redwood just
issuing from Mr. Lenox's court-yard.
He felt an invincible disinclination to
meet her alone, and seeing that he was
not perceived by her, he placed his hand
on the garden-fence and sprang over it,
and turning around some shrubbery, he
was no longer within the range of Miss
Redwood's observation. The spell of
her beauty was broken; the power of
the enchantress over him for ever lost by
the revelation which she had made of
her character in the conversation of the
preceding day. Thank Heaven!
exclaimed
Westall, audibly, I have awoke
before it is too late.
And what is that you thank Heaven
for, young man? inquired Debby, who
was sitting under the shade of an apple
tree shelling some beans.
Why, Miss Deborah, replied
Westall
,
smiling at his own abstraction, is
there not always enough of good
received
or danger escaped to be thankful
for?
A plenty, young mana plenty,
especially with you young folks, who
have not the clearest light to walk by,
and are too full of conceit to see by the
candle of older people's experience.
Pride and conceit are your ruin: I don't
mean yours in particular, Mr. Westall,
Deborah continued, casting a side and
approving glance at his fine modest and
benignant countenance, but the rising
generation in generalit is pride and
conceit that keep up such a will-worship,
as the great Bunyan would call it. There
is that Carliny girl, all nature could not
convince her that all God's creatures
wer'n't made for her sarvice and
convenience
.The
girl is no fool neither,
nat'rally she is rather bright; the fault
is in her bringing up; that I own is a
VOL. II. D
master-puzzle to me how such a
reasonable
smart man as squire Redwooda
very pretty behaved man too, especially
when you consider that he has lived in a
slave countryhow he could have good
materials worked up into such a poor
manufacture. It is quite a pleasure,
continued Deborah, stimulated to
proceed
as others might have been by so
patient a listener, It is quite a pleasure
to meet such a man as the Squire, who
has travelled in the old countries, and
taken note of what he has seen; for he
a'n't like those travellers I have heard a
man liken to Jonah in the whale's belly,
who go a great ways and see nothing.
But, after all, she continued, giving the
tin pan into which she was shelling her
beans, an energetic shake, after all, I
don't know what good such stores of
knowledge do people, if they don't make
them of some sarvice in their conduct
and happiness. To my mind, Mr.
Westall
,
it is as if men were to gather all the
nourishing rains into great cisterns, and
there keep them, instead of letting them
fall upon the earth, to bring forth good
entertainment for man and horse, as the
tavern signs say. Now there is my sister
Lenox: she has not what are called
shining talents; but, Mr. Westall, she
has used all she has, in the true scriptur
way. Just cast your eye about this
garden
;I
don't mean to praise myself,
though I take all the care of it, 'bating
the help I get from the boys, but poor
tools at such worklook round at the
long saace, the short saace, and the green
saace
[1]
[1]
Sauce
, pronounced
saace
or
sarce
, is in most
parts of New-England the vulgar name for culinary
vegetables:
e. g.
long saacefor beets, carrots, &c.;
short saacefor potatoes and turnips.
; they are all of my planting; and
as you may observe, there is not a spot
in the garden as big as your hat crown
that has not some good and useful thing
tucked into it, except it may be the
pinies and pinks and rosesand them are
D 2
good for sore eyes and other kinds of
ailments
,
besides being pretty notions for
the children;well, this garden is a
parfect
picture of Miss Lenox's management
of her family. Eleven children has she
brought up, that is, the most of them are
brought up, and the rest in a thriving
wayand an honour and a credit will
they be to her, and a blessing to the
world, when she has played her part out
above ground; and that time must come
to her, as to all, continued Debby,
passing
the back of her hand across her
eyes, and it is a time she need not
shrink from,for such a life is what you
may call a continual making-ready for it.
In my view, though it has never fallen
to my lot to be married and have
children
but
that is neither here nor
therein my view there can't be so
praiseful a monument to the memory of
a parent as a real good child. I never
mind this rhodomontade upon
tomb-stones
any more than so much novel
writing; some of it may be truethe
poor creatures that's mouldering away
below, has lived and died, so much we
know is sartin; but for the most part it's
like one of the stories of that Gulliver
revived, that's so divarting to the boys.
Yes, a real virtuous child is a crown of
glory to the parent; and as I said before,
all the tomb-stones in the world, even
them peramids and obelisks, and things
cut out of brass, and made of a kind of
marble mason-work that squire
Redwood
tells about in the old countries,
they a'n't to be mentioned with it.
It surprises me, said Westall, who
was evidently greatly interested by the
honest and affectionate zeal with which
Deborah lauded her sisterIt
surprises
me, Miss Deborah, that with such
very correct views of the happiness and
duties of parents, you should have chosen
a single life.
Deborah's smile showed she was not
insensible to the compliment implied in
the word
chosen;
for like other maidens,
she preferred it should be understood
that she did not walk in the solitary
path of celibacy by compulsion. Oh,
it was a whim of my own, she replied,
and there is no danger of such whims
being catchingsooner or later every
body slides off into the beaten road of
matrimony.
But it is a pity, Miss Deborah, that
you
should have been governed by such
a whim.
Why I don't know, Mr. WestallI
don't know. In the first place, there is
no danger in the example, for there's
nobody that will follow it of their own
good-will. I don't wish to speak my own
epitaph, 'logium, or whatever you call it,
but to my mind, a lone woman that no
one notices, no one praises, that is not
coaxed into goodness, that envies no one,
minds her own affairs, is contented and
happysuch a woman is a sight to
behold
!
And to admirecertainly. I agree
with you entirely, Miss Debby, replied
Westall.
Deborah turned her eye upon Westall,
pleased with his cordial concurrence in
her own opinion, but his had been
attracted
by a groupe that seemed to have
just taken their stations at the entrance
door, which we have before had occasion
to notice on the north side of Mr.
Lenox's house. Oh, I see how it is,
young man, she said, good naturedly,
old women have no chance at ears or
eyes when young ones come in sight,
especially those so comely as she is.
I do not see Miss Redwood, replied
Westall, his eyes still rivetted to the
spot.
Bless your dear heart, no, but you
see one that is worth as many of her as
can stand 'twixt here and Carliny.
But it was beauty you spoke of, Miss
Debby; and with all your partiality, I
presume you do not pretend that Miss
Bruce has as much beauty as Miss
Redwood
?
Do notbut indeed I do though,
and I could prove it too, to the
satisfaction
of any reasonable person.
Ah, replied Westall, that is a
matter
of taste, that has not much to do with
proof or reason; but let me see, Miss
Debby, how you make out your case.
I will be the champion of Miss
Redwood's
beauty, and sure no knight ever
had a fairer cause for his chivalry. What
do you say to that incomparable hair,
black and glossy as a raven's
plumage
,
turning into rich curls whenever
it escapes from the classic braids that
confine it?
Oh, you talk too high grammar for
me, Mr. Westall. Well, I never before
heard there was any beauty in black
hair; why mine was as black as hers
before
it turned gray, and I never heard
a word said about the beauty of it. Now
tell me, Mr. Westall, on your conscience,
if you can think that black hair plaited,
and twisted, and fussified, to be
compared
with Ellen's beautiful brown hair?
why, man, I don't believe you ever saw
it when she was combing it.
No, I certainly never had that
privilege
.
Well, proceeded Debby, in her
earnestness, not heeding the smile that
hovered on Westall's lip, I can tell you
it reaches almost to the tops of her shoes;
and then, when she doubles it into them
rich folds, and fastens it with her comb,
and parts it from the front in a kind of a
wavedid you ever see any thing that
had a cleaner, prettier look? and so
bright and polished as if the sun was
shining into it.
I yield the point of the hair, Miss
Debby; but what do you say to Miss
Redwood's high marble brow?
Proud, proud, Sir, and as cold as
marble. Now Ellen's is just what a
woman's should be, modest and meek.
D 3
I am not gifted at description; but if
you ever saw that picture of the Virgin
Mary that our George sent home to his
mother, (and between you and I, I
always thought it was because it was such
a likeness of Ellen that he sent it) you
will know what I mean: look at the
forehead, the temple, the mouth, the
eyesyes, most especially the eyes, and
you will say, `this is an immortal
creatur'
you
need not smile, Mr. Westall:
what I mean is, that that face has been
lit up by a spark from heaven, as the
hymn-book says, `a vital spark of heavenly
flame,' and a spark that will never die.
Now I should like to know if you get
any such idea from Miss Redwood's flesh
and blood?
Oh, Miss Debby, I confess myself
vanquished: I give up the face, but you
will certainly have the candour to allow
that Miss Redwood has the finest figure;
so tall and gracefulshe moves like
Juno.
That I won't deny. She is just like
one of them heathen idols: every motion,
sitting or rising, walking or standing,
seems to say, look at me! worship me!
but Ellen!she is behind a cloud just
now; but if you had seen her as I have
seen her, every step as light and springy
as a fawn's, and now, if you take notice,
her motions are all free like a child's, she
never seems to think any one is looking
at her. I never read any to speak of, in
poetry, and novel books, and such things,
so I can't compare Miss Redwood to any
of the gentry you find there, but she
always brings to my mind the daughters
of Zion spoken of by the Prophet Isaiah,
in his third chapter, 16th verse and on;
while Ellen is like those Christian women
the apostle commends, whose adorning
is not outwardly, but that of a meek and
quiet spirit: there is just the difference
between the two girls that there is
between
the pomp and show and to-do of
the old Jewish worship, and of that of
our times, which is, (that is, ought to be)
in spirit and in truth.
Oh, you are blind, Miss Debby,
replied Westall, laughing, there is no
use in contesting the point with you, but
I will go and see if I can discover any of
these surprising charms; so saying, he
walked towards the house, while
Deborah
following him with her eyes, could
not help wondering that a young man
who seemed to her not to want sense or
discernment should not, after all, know
darkness from light.
There had been showers during the
night which had changed the air from
extreme sultriness to a delicious purity
and coolness. Even old Mrs. Allen's
frame seemed newly braced by the sweet
freshening breezes that came over the
lake. Ellen had persuaded her to have
her easy chair drawn to the door, in the
hope that she would be cheered by the
bright scene before her. After
adjusting
her pillows, placing a footstool at
her feet, and putting her snuff-box and
handkerchief into her lap, Oh, said
she, Mrs. Allen, is it not a glorious
morning? Look at the mountains
beyond
the lake, how bright and distinct
they look.
My eyes are dim, childI cannot
see them.
Now, said Ellen, placing the old
lady's spectacles over her eyes, now
you can see: oh, only look where the
mist still rests between the mountains,
and looks like a flood of melted silver;
and there where it is rising up the side
of the mountainso bright, one might
fancy it enrobed spirits of the airand
above, what a silvery curtain it hangs
over that highest pointand there it has
risen, and is melting away on the pure
blue of the sky: the lake too is alive
with the spirit of the morning, and the
merry waves as they come dancing on
before the breeze, seem to laugh as they
break on the shore. Ellen was an
enthusiast in her susceptibility to the
influence of natural beauty; the bright
scene before her had kindled a rapturous
sensation which might excuse one
moment
of forgetfulness that her old friend's
senses were dull and cold; that the
chords were broken, over which the glad
voice of nature might breathe,
discoursing
sweet music. Here, Ellen, said
she, languidly, put away these
spectacles
the
days have come that I have
no pleasure in them: there is a heavy
weight on my heart, child, and it will
not bound at such sights.
But, dear Mrs. Allen, throw aside
the weight for a little while, said Ellen,
while she playfully held the spectacles
over the old lady's eyes, you must
enjoy this morningall nature rejoices
the birds fill the sweet air with their
music; and see those insects, what
myriads
of them are whirling in a giddy
circle.
And look, aunt Allen, said little
Lucy Lenox, who had just joined them,
look at the hay-makers, how busy and
happy they are!
But, Eddy is not among them,
replied the old lady, giving way to a
childish burst of tears. Where shall I
look for my children, Ellen?
Oh, Mrs. Allen, all this beauty is
but a shadow of that brighter sphere to
which Edward is gone.
But, my little Emily, that lost one!
The lost one may be yet found,
dear Mrs. Allen, it is not right for you
to despair.
Your ministry is a kind one, my
young friend, said Mr. Redwood,
advancing
from his room where he had been
listening to Ellen; but vain I am afraid.
The sick cannot swallow the food of the
healthy; Mrs. Allen and I have
travelled
so far on this wearisome journey of
life that we have exhausted the resources
of youth.
Mrs. Allen either did not hear or
heed Mr. Redwood. Lucy, she said,
get your Testament and read me a few
chapters; that is all the comfort left to
me.
There are then, said Ellen, looking
timidly at Mr. Redwood, some
resources
that cannot be exhausted.
Happy are those who think so,
replied
Mr. Redwood, with an equivocal
smile, which indicated that his respect
for Ellen alone prevented him from
saying
,
`that such a nostrum might do for
an old woman, but had no efficacy for
more enlightened subjects.'
Lucy brought her Testament, and
seating
herself on Mrs. Allen's footstool,
began her reading.
Lucy, said Ellen to Mr. Redwood,
is quite a rustic, like the rest of us
unlearned in the forms of courtesy.
I should be sorry, Miss Bruce, that
you should deem me such a bigot to the
usages of the world, as to require that an
essential kindness should be deferred to
the forms of politeness. No, so far
from it, that if Miss Lucy will permit me,
I will be one of her auditors. So
saying
,
he seated himself, and Ellen, having
brought her portfolio from an adjoining
room, placed herself on a bench under
the elm tree which grew a few yards from
the door-step. She was just finishing a
sketch of the view from Mr. Lenox's
house, which she had promised to George
Lenox. Lucy proceeded with her
reading
,
and Mr. Redwood listened with
apparent interest, which might be
accounted
for by the novelty of the book
to him; for, `en philosophe,' he had
judged and condemned without
examining
the only record that pretends to any
credible authority to teach us our duties
and our destiny.
The lecture would have been long,
and might have been profitable, but it
was interrupted by the approach of Mrs.
Westall and Miss Redwood; they had
been joined by Mr. Lenox, and Charles
Westall, who was just issuing from the
garden gate as the ladies entered the
yard. I did not know that this was an
accomplishment of yours, Miss Bruce,
said Westall, advancing to her, and
casting
his eye over her drawing, which was
too faithful a copy of the scene before
them to be mistaken.
My knowledge of the art does not
merit so dignified a name, Mr. Westall;
slight as it is, however, it is a great
gratification
when it gives me the
opportunity
of gratifying an absent friend.
And do you limit your benevolence
to the absent, or will you permit me to
examine the contents of your port-folio?
Certainly, said Ellen, although
it will hardly reward you for the trouble.
Ellen was unostentatious, and at the same
time free from that false modesty which
has its source in pride. She would have
shrunk from any thing approaching to
an exhibition of any of her talents, but
she did not either from vanity or false
humility imagine that there was in the
efforts of her skill in drawing anything
either to do her honour or discredit.
Westall seemed in a most provokingly
admiring humour. Not a graceful line,
a happy light, or fortunate shadow
escaped his observation. He called his
mother and Miss Redwood, to point out
to them a thousand beauties. Caroline's
colour, brilliant from exercise, was
certainly
heightened as she approached
Ellen. She looked over the drawings
languidly, and said, they were pretty
sketches for any one who fancied
landscapes
.
Her mind was evidently intent
on something beside the drawings, for
her eye wandered from her father to
Ellen for a few moments, when she seated
herself with an expression of sullenness
and abstraction that recalled the
transactions
of the preceding evening to all
that had witnessed them: an
awkwardness
came over the whole party. Ellen
busied herself with arranging and
replacing
her drawings; the operation did not
seem to be accelerated by Westall's
efforts to aid her.
Mr. Redwood gazed on the two girls
with feelings sufficiently mortifying to
his paternal pride; he had abused the
noblest feelings of his nature, but not
extinguished them; his aspirations went
beyond the mean gratification of his
vanity, which might have been derived
from the rare beauty of his daughter.
The classic elegance of her figure, the
brilliancy of her complexion (the more
striking for its singularity in our southern
country) the symmetry of her features,
and that perfect control of her graceful
movements which pride and fashionable
success had given to her, invested her
with a right to the infallible decision of
the beau-monde, which had already
pronounced
her an unrivalled beauty. `Ah,'
thought her father, as he explored her
face in vain for some expression that
might consecrate so fair a temple, and
sighed at the pride, discontent, and scorn
which he met there, `ah, my child, you
look like a fit idol for a pagan worship;
men would deify you, but you are all
earthly. This Ellen Bruce,' thought he,
as he turned his eye towards her, `has
such a look of spirituality, so bright, and
so tranquil too, that if there is a heaven
she is surely destined to it.' Ellen had
in truth a face of the beatitudes. `
My
child,' thought Mr. Redwood, as he
pursued his melancholy reflections, `has
no right to such an expression. Ellen's
is full of notable morality which it doth
delightfully teach, and might almost
inspire.'
Mr. Redwood was roused from his
reverie
by Lenox, who observing that his
guest looked unusually grave, said, why
how now, Squire Redwood, can't all
these women folks keep you in heartor
maybe you are heart-whole, but it is the
arm pains you?
No, replied Mr. Redwood, the
arm is doing well enough, and will I hope
soon be at the service of any of the ladies;
but it is not their province, Sir, to keep
the heart whole.
I don't know as to that, replied
Lenox: it is true wife gave mine
something of a jerk when I was young;
but I am one of the contented sort, Sir,
and contentment, as likely you may have
observed, is an article that is not to be
bought.
I believe not, friend Lenox, for if
all men were of my mind, they would be
all buyers and no sellers.
Well, that is honest, Squire, I like
that. If it was to be bought, I'm
thinking
you could make the purchase, if any
body, for I judge you to be something
of a nabob. What may be your yearly
income, Squire?
Mr. Redwood was not prepared for so
direct an investigation of his pecuniary
affairs, he replied, indeed, Sir, I do not
know.
Don't know! exclaimed Lenox,
quite unsuspicious of the impropriety of
his inquirythat's surprisingI took
the Squire for one of those smart
knowing
people that understands all about
their own affairs. It must take, he
continued, surveying Caroline, a pretty
considerable handsome sum to furnish
your daughter with all the fine clothes I
see her wear. I dare say that her
gewgaws
(no offence, Miss Caroline, I only
mean the flourishes) and your coach, and
such kind of nick-nacks, cost you as
much as it does a plain man like me to
support my whole family, and bring them
up in what may be called an honourable
manner.
It is very possible, replied Mr.
Redwood.
Well, pursued the indefatigable
man, this is a free country, and every
man has a right to do what he will with
his own; if you are a mind to dress Miss
Caroline in diamonds and gold beads, it
is none of my affair. You never had any
other child, I believe, Sir?
No, Sir.
That is a pitysuch a fortune as you
have to give makes a girl a sort of a prey
to all the hungry hunters after money;
but may be you calculate to divide some
of your property with your other
relations
?
I have made no calculations on the
subject, Sir.
I wonder you have never married
again, Mr. Redwood; I conclude you
was never married but once?
You have a right to your own
conclusions
,
Sir, replied Mr. Redwood, so
sternly, that Ellen involuntarily looked
towards him. His eye met hers, and he
was mortified that he should have
betrayed
his vexation, and he became still
more disconcerted when Ellen said
playfully
,
oh Mr. Lenox, do not expect
Mr. Redwood to tell all the secrets of
his life before `the women folks.'
Secrets of my life! echoed Mr.
Redwood, but in a smothered voice,
while Caroline, who had been listening
intently to the close of the conversation,
sprang on her feet, and grasping Ellen's
arm, exclaimed, looking on her as if she
would have pierced her soul with the
inquiry
,
Ellen Bruce! what do you
mean?
The movement had been involuntary.
Caroline, unused to control her slightest
emotions, could not resist the mastery of
a strong passion. Ellen turned on her a
look of such surprise and innocence, that
she sunk back alarmed at her own
precipitancy
.
Every eye was now fixed on
her, as if to demand an explanation;
while Mr. Redwood, whose mottled cheek
and contracted brow betrayed strong
emotion, was the first to recover his
selfpossession
;
and when Caroline, hiding
her face with her handkerchief, said,
excuse me, Miss Bruce, I am not well
this morning, her father said, sternly,
VOL. II. E
your extraordinary conduct needs that
apology, Carolineoblige me with a few
minutes in my room.
The request had too much the tone of
a command to be disregarded; and
Caroline
(glad too to escape observation)
followed her father. Mr. Redwood before
entering his room turned to Mr. Lenox,
and with the air of courtesy that always
distinguished him, said, my good friend
Lenox, you must forgive my rudeness.
We southern people are a little shy, and
do not understand this game of
question
and answer as well as you frank
northerners.
Oh, no offence, Sir, none in the
world, said the good-natured Lenox,
it is a free country, Sir, that we live in,
and every man has a right to his own
notions
,
be they ever so notional; that is
my doctrine.
And a very liberal one, Sir, replied
Mr. Redwood, slightly bowing, and
smiling
as he closed the door after him.
Well, well, said Lenox, women
are strange cattle. Why what ailed the
girl, Ellen: is she hystericky? or may
be, he added, lowering his voice, and
chuckling with the pride of a discoverer,
may be she is afraid you'll get away her
sweetheart, Ellen, ha? have I guessed
it? It was now poor Ellen's turn to
blush: she recollected suddenly that
Mrs. Allen had been sitting in the air too
long, and begged Mr. Lenox to assist
her to her room, whither she followed,
leaving Mrs. Westall and her son to their
own musings.
Charles Westall returned to the
examination
of the drawings which Ellen,
in the haste of her attention to Mrs.
Allen, had forgotten.
Little Lucy stood by his side; there,
said he, to the child, do you know that
Miss Bruce has put you into the picture,
just as you sat reading to your aunt?
Oh, has she! George will be glad to
see me there?
E 2
George! who is George? inquired
Charles Westall.
My brother; don't you know George?
No, I do not. Is the picture for
him, Lucy?
Oh yes, Mr. Westall; and pray why
should not it be for him? asked the
simple child, giving a very natural
interpretation
to the shade that flitted over
Westall's face. I am sure, she
continued
,
George has sent a great many
beautiful books to Ellen, and George
loves her.
Does he? exclaimed Westall.
Yes, indeed, does he; don't you,
Mr. Westall? I thought every body loved
Ellen.
Lenox at this moment rejoined them,
like father, like child, exclaimed he,
with a hearty laugh,come along,
Lucy; you and I ask plaguy unlucky
questions this morning. Young man,
he added, turning to Charles, I take a
fancy to youand if you do get any
whims into your head, all the harm I wish
you is, that you may have better luck
than poor George.
We will not pretend to say whether it
was the information insinuated in the
kind-hearted Lenox's wish, or the
expression
of his favour, but one, or the
other, or both, certainly kindled a bright
expression of pleasure in Westall's face:
his mother noticed it, and after Mr.
Lenox
had walked away she said to her son,
I am surprised, Charles, that you do
not repress that man's familiarity; he is
really becoming intolerable.
Oh, not at all so to me, my dear
mother.
But, Charles, did you ever hear any
thing so impertinent as his questions to
Mr. Redwood?
They scarcely deserve to be so
stigmatised
.
Mr. Lenox lives in a simple
state of society, where each man knows
every particular of his neighbour's affairs,
and he never suspected that his guest
would not be as free to tell as he to ask.
It is very easy to see all the imperfections
of unpolished surfaces; but, perhaps, dear
mother, as your eye seems somewhat
dazzled
by Miss Redwood's charms, you did
not notice her strange start of passion.
I noticed it, Charles, but I did not
think it strange. Caroline has been out
of spirits all the morningquite dejected.
You wounded her feelings last night, my
son, too severely; it was that which
made her so sensitive this morning.
She was vexed, as she ought to have
been, with the idle questions of this man
Lenox; and perhaps she thought (for I
thought so myself) that there was
something
too familiar in Miss Bruce's
manner
and observation.
I confess, mother, that a young lady
who gives such energetic
demonstrations
of her vexation at an offence so
trifling, is rather formidable; and I
think with you that it would be prudent
to avoid her resentment.
But, Charles, I am in earnestyou
are trifling with your own interest; and
I am sorry to say, my son, that you seem
to have forgotten the deep obligations
we are under to Mr. Redwoodhis
friendship for your fatherfor you.
Caroline's only offence seems to be a
predilection (perhaps too obvious) for
you, and the kindest, most generous
affection for me. Mrs. Westall paused
she thought Charles's silence
indicated
conviction, and she ventured to
proceed
a step farther: as to this Miss
Bruce, her story is quite an incredible
one. Do not look at me thus, my son.
I do not mean that it is an intentional
imposture of hersI dare say she is
that is, she may be, quite innocent about
it; but as Caroline says, and Caroline
has uncommon penetrationin that she
resembles her fatherCaroline says that
it must be an invention of Ellen's mother
to screen the disgrace of her birth; of
course you know a woman of the sort
that her mother must have been would
not scruple a contrivance of that kind,
which might induce some credulous
fellow, as Caroline says, to marry her
daughter. No considerate man certainly
would think of marrying a woman whose
history is so involved in mysteryas
Caroline says, no man in his senses
should forget the old proverb, `like
mother, like daughter.'
For heaven's sake, my dear mother,
exclaimed Westall, unable any longer to
maintain his dutiful patience, speak
from your own heart, and do not retail
to me any more of Miss Redwood's
sayings
;
forgive meI cannot endure to
see her play on your kind dispositions.
I appeal, my dear mother, to your own
heart. Is there not something touching
sacredin Ellen Bruce's faith in her
mother's truthin her scrupulous and
patient fidelity? I declare to you, if
Miss Redwood is right in her worst
conjectures
,
I think the parent's fault is
redeemed
by the daughter's virtue.
Mrs. Westall knew that her son was
unmanageable in any matter in which
his feelings were earnestly engaged,
though habitually yielding in trifles; she
saw the impossibility of stemming the
present current that had set against her.
Although dazzled by the brilliant
prospects
that she had imagined were
opening
to her son, she was not quite
insensible
to the virtuous feelings that
governed
him, and when she concluded the
conversation by saying, Charles, you
are a singular being, there was a
mixture
of satisfaction and disappointment
in the confession.
The purely accidental inquiries of
honest Lenox had operated like the
apple of discord on the group assembled
at the good man's door. It is too well
known to require remark that this busy
spirit of investigation pervades the mass
E 3
of society in New-Englandleaveneth
the whole lump. It appears, among
the illiterate, in what the polite call idle
and impertinent questions, and, among
the educated, in a very free and
sometimes
inconvenient spirit of inquiry into
what the prudent or austere would deem
unquestionable. Whether this passion
is blameable or praiseworthy we leave to
those whom it may concern to
determine
;
but certain we are that it is
incurable
;
since it has been our chance
to see an old lady perfectly blind and
deaf, who, by taking the hand of a
friend, and understanding from a strong
or feeble pressure an affirmative or
negative
,
contrived so ingeniously and
indefatigably
to vary and multiply her
questions, as to ascertain all the details
of all the affairs of all her acquaintance.
There had been so many agreeable
circumstances in Mr. Redwood's
situation
,
that he had for the most part
endured
this inevitable evil with good
nature
;
but sometimes his wincing would
show that he was galled, and once or
twice he thought that the case of the
poor Dutchman, who is said to have been
questioned to death by a relentless
Yankee
,
would not have been a singular
instance of the fatal effects of this
curious
mode of persecution.
CHAPTER XII.
But I have seen since past the Tweed,
What much has changed my sceptic creed.
Marmion
.
Mr. Redwood
, as has been said,
retreated
to his room; and Caroline, with
the appearance at least of passive
obedience
,
followed him. A few moments'
reflection restored to her her
self-confidence
.
She now for the first time in her
life felt the operation of powerful
motives
,
and the strength of her own
passions
.
She was destitute of natural
sensitiveness
,
and emboldened by the hardy
resolution that had never experienced
trial nor defeat. Determined to repair
the faults of her sudden gust of passion
by a wariness that should baffle her father's
penetration, she folded her arms, and
seated herself very composedly, as if
awaiting her father's pleasurewhile he
walked the room in extreme, and as his
varying colour indicated, uncontrolable
agitation. He complained of his arm
it was excessively painful; then, Sir,
said his daughter, with the most perfect
nonchalance, the attendance of the
physician would be more appropriate
than mine.
No! replied Mr. Redwood, in a
thrilling tone; nothere is no
physician
that can heal my wounds. Oh
Caroline! he continued, suddenly
taking her hand, you are my child, my
only childhe was choked by his
emotion
,
and unable to proceed; he again
turned from her, while she with a
coolness
which bordered on insult, replied,
yes, Sir, so I flattered myself; but you
announce it as if it were a discovery.
Mr. Redwood sunk into a chair, his
face betrayed the strong mental conflict
he was suffering. The emotion his
daughter had manifested at the question
and remarks, to which, as he thought his
conscience could alone give significance,
had led him to suppose that she had in
some way possessed herself of his early
history, and he had suddenly resolved
to obtain from her all she knew, and to
disclose to her all of which she was
ignorant
.
Her manner had checked
congealed the current of his feelings;
his habitual reserve, which in this
moment
of excitement a kind tone, a single
expression of gentleness, of affectionate
sympathy, would have dissipated for
ever, resumed its power over him. He
sat silent and abstracted until Caroline
said, as you seem to have no farther
occasion for me, Sir, I will go to my own
apartment.
No, stay, Carolineyou must first
explain to me your singular conduct to
Miss Bruce.
Miss Redwood said there was nothing
to explain  she meant nothing  she
thought it very extraordinary that she
must give a reason for every movement
her manner might have been a little
hurriedshe was not very wellshe was
fatigued with her walkteased to death
with old Lenox's impertinence, and
disgusted
with Miss Bruce.
But why disgusted, Caroline? It
seems to me nothing could be more
proper
than the gentle check Miss Bruce
gave to Lenox; nothing more innocent
and unmeaning than what she said.
You certainly, Sir, are the most
competent
judge of her meaningif you
were not offended it was quite
unnecessary
that I should be provoked.
Caroline? what would you say, what
would you insinuate?
Nothing in the world, Sir, she
answered
,
and added with a bitter smile,
nothing but what you may choose to
understand. I am not accustomed, she
continued, undisturbedly enduring her
father's piercing gaze, I am not
accustomed
to have so much importance
attached
to my expressions. Miss Bruce
may walk in mystery, and talk enigmas
with impunity, while my poor simple
phrases are received like the dark
sayings
of a sybil.
Mr. Redwood's suspicions were again
averted by his daughter's skill and daring
in parrying his question. After a few
moments' consideration, he wondered
they had been excited, and believed that
she had accidentally touched the secret
spring which he alone commanded. He
said something of the excitability of his
feelings in his present weak state, and
did not permit Caroline to leave him
without exhorting her to be more
careful
and conciliating in her manners for
the little time they should remain at
Eton. He again departed from the strict
reserve he had imposed upon himself,
and hinted how much he should be
pained by Caroline's losing the esteem
of Westall, and even how much he
should be gratified by her securing and
returning the young man's affections.
She replied, that to secure Mr.
Westall's
affections she had no reason to
believe
would be a difficult enterpriseas
to her own, she was in no haste to
dispose
of them.
Her father commended her reserve,
said he had no wish to control her choice
of a husband, and perhaps no right to
expect her confidence.
Our intercourse, Sir, she said, rising
to leave the room, has not been
particularly
confidential.
Strange girl! exclaimed her father,
as she closed the door after her; what
has so suddenly invested you with the
power to torture me?
Mr. Redwood began now to talk of
recommencing his journey, which Dr.
Bristol assured him he might do after a
few days without any hazard. As the
time approached for his departure, he
felt a growing reluctance to leave the
rustic friends from whom he had received
such genuine kindness, and whose
simple
and tranquil pleasures had in some
degree restored a healthful tone to his
mind. From day to day he delayed
fixing the time of their departure, for
which both Mrs. Westall and Caroline
had become excessively impatient. The
blessing, whatever it may be, of `those
that wait,' seemed to have descended
upon Charles Westall. He was, as he
insisted it became him to be, since he
was in attendance on his superior, a
monument
of patience. It is possible that
his virtue was in part owing to his being
indulged almost constantly with Miss
Bruce's society. Mrs. Allen, as
Deborah
had suggested, had become quite
childish; and of late she had taken a
whim to sit constantly in the parlour,
where the company was in the habit of
assembling. She took no part in the
conversation which she probably did not
understand, but (as we have sometimes
remarked of persons at her stage of
existence
)
the variety of tones and objects
appeared to afford her a kind of
excitement
and relief.
Caroline was evidently annoyed by
this new arrangement, but she had tact
enough to conceal how hard it was for
her to submit to it, and to deport herself
with such decent decorum and medium
civility, as in general to avert
observation
,
and most effectually to conceal her
secret sentiments.
Mrs. Westall, who was really amiable
when not perverted by a bad influence,
was sometimes won by the sweetness of
Ellen's manners to forget the superior
attractions of Miss Redwood; and Ellen,
happy in her own integrity, and
unconscious
of design, was frank, natural, and
often spirited: so much so, that Westall
thought that if she had not all the pensive
and serious beauty which Deborah had
attributed to her, she possessed a variety
and animation that were more in harmony
with the spring-time of life. For
himself
,
with the
inconsequence
of a feeling
and generous nature, he abandoned
himself
without a calculation for the future
to present influences. If the ladies
walked, and the mother flattered herself
that by her skilful disposition she had
secured Charles's attendance to Caroline,
he was sure to revert to Ellen's side in
some direct way, that distanced
manoeuvring
if
he read aloud, at every fine
passage his eye appealed to Ellen
in every conversation they expressed
almost simultaneously the same
sentiment
.
On one occasion their sympathy was
elicited in a way that excited some
apprehension in the observers as to
its dangerous tendency. Caroline had
arranged a Turkish turban on Mrs.
Westall's head, which she pronounced
to be surprisingly becoming.
See, papa, she said, does not Mrs.
Westall look twenty years younger for
this turban?
The turban does you infinite credit
certainly, Caroline, replied her father,
but I cannot pay it a compliment which
would imply that any disposition of her
dress could make Mrs. Westall look
twenty years younger.
Ah my dear Caroline, interposed
Mrs. Westall, you know not how far
you tax your father's sincerity; he knew
me twenty years agoand he perceives
that (as Miss Debby insists, you know)
`every year has made its mark.' Time
makes sad havoc in twenty years, she
continued addressing herself to Mr.
Redwood; I think it is little more than
that since my beautiful friend, Mary
Erwine, was staying with me, and you
were almost constantly at our house
bless me, Caroline, you have run that
pin half way into my head.
Caroline `begged pardonsaid she
had put the last pin in the turban, and
would go and meet Mr. Westall, who she
saw coming up from the lake, and
bespeak
his suffrage for her taste.'
The mention of Mary Erwine
appeared
to have revived the past in Mrs.
Westall's memory. Pray, Mr.
Redwood
,
she asked, did you ever see
Mary after she went to live with the
Emlyns?
Yesrepeatedly.
There was something startling in the
tone of Mr. Redwood's voice, for Ellen,
who was sitting beside Mrs. Allen at one
extremity of the room, let fall a book
which she was intently perusing, and
looked involuntarily at him: and Mrs.
Westall said with a smile, you remind
me of one of my dear Edmund's
sentimental
fancieshe thought you were in
love with Mary. Mr. Redwood made
no reply, and she continuedI knew
you would not think of her of course;
poor Maryshe was a sweet creature
such simplicity and tendernessand such
perfect beauty. She left Virginia I think
soon after you embarked for Europe:
indeed it was not long after that she
died. I never could endure to think of
her melancholy fateso beautiful and so
youngnot seventeen when she died.
Miss Bruce, interrupted Mr.
Redwood
,
may I trouble you for a glass of
water? Ellen brought one from an
adjoining
room.
Upon my word, said Mrs. Westall,
it never struck me before, but I really
fancy Miss Bruce resembles Mary; did
it ever occur to you?
Yes, madam, I perceived it, I was
struck with it the first time I saw Miss
Bruce.
Mr. Redwood spoke quick and with a
tremulous voice, he knew that he had
betrayed emotion, and anxious to put a
stop to the conversation, he turned
suddenly
to Ellen, and asked her what book
she was reading.
The Absentee.
The Absenteea tale of Miss
Edgeworth's
,
I believe; will you do me the
favour to read aloud?
Certainly; but I am near the
conclusion
of the book.
That is of no consequence; the story
is, in my view, always a subordinate part,
and the sense and spirit of Miss
Edgeworth's
dialogue, open her books where
you will, is sure to instruct and
entertain
you.
Well, Sir, then I will begin where I
am, just at the adjustment of an account
with a Mr. Solo, `no vulgar
tradesman
.'
Ellen read aloud, but she had not read
far when Caroline entered with Charles
Westall; and she laid aside her book
while the turban was discussed. Westall
pronounced it to be beautiful, declared
it could not have been in better taste if
his mother had had the graces for her
Coffeurs.
But, Miss Bruce, he said, addressing
Ellen, I entreat that we may not
interrupt
your reading.
No, Miss Ellen, said Mr. Redwood,
they must notI as an invalid have a
right to be humouredI beg you will
proceed.
Ellen resumed the book, and read with
feeling and expression the
ever-memorable
scene of Colambre's declaration to
Grace Nugent, till she came to the
passage
where Colambre says, there is an
`invincible obstacle' to their union. Her
voice faltered; but she would have had
enough self-command to proceed, had
not Mr. Redwood inquired, what
obstacle
could be invincible where a
creature
so artless, so frank, so charming,
was in question?
A sufficient obstacle, papa,
interposed
Caroline; Lord Colambre
believed
that Miss Nugent's mother was
not `sans reproche.'
That may be a sufficient obstruction
VOL. II. F
in a work of fiction, replied Mr.
Redwood
,
but in real life, with a man of
sense and feeling, a man deeply in love,
too, I fancy it would not be a very
serious
objection. What say you, Charles,
you are a young man of the class I have
named?
Mr. Redwood looked to Westall for a
reply; he perceived his question had
disconcerted himhe looked at Ellen,
her face was crimsonthe application
that had been made of the fictitious
incident
instantly flashed across his mind.
I perceive, he added, with his usual
adroitness, that I have proposed a nice
question in ethics. I am no casuist, and
was not aware that it admitted a doubt.
Nor does it, said Westall, recovering
himself completely. I know not how
it may be in the artificial ethics of the
world, but it seems to me to be the
decision
of natural justice that the fault of
one person cannot be transferred to
another
that
it cannot be right to make an
innocent child suffer for the guilt of its
parent.
Ellen took a long breath, and oppressed
with the consciousness of feelings which
she feared to expose, she experienced the
greatest relief from an opportunity that
was afforded her to escape from the
apartment, without attracting
observation
to herself, by Deborah's appearance
at the door with a letter in her hand, and
a summons to Mrs. Lenox.
Mrs. Westall and Caroline fell into a
conversation which, though conducted in
a whisper, appeared to be very
interesting
to themselves. Westall took up the
book Ellen had laid down: his eyes
seemed spell-bound to the page she had
been reading, for Mr. Redwood (whose
vigilance was now thoroughly awakened,)
observed that he did not turn the leaf;
and Mr. Redwood had himself an ample
fund for meditation in the possibility
that had now for the first time occurred
to him that Ellen, the undesigning artless
F 2
Ellen, might frustrate his long cherished
project.
In the evening, after Mrs. Westall and
her son had returned to the village, and
Miss Redwood had retired to her
apartment
,
Mr. Redwood was still sitting in
the parlour, reading some newspapers
which had been received by the day's
mail, when Ellen entered, and after
apologising
for interrupting him, said, that
she had just determined on leaving Eton
in the morning, and she was not willing
to go without expressing her gratitude
to Mr. Redwood for the kind attentions
he had bestowed on her.
Mr. Redwood, after expressing his
surprise and regret, inquired the cause of
this sudden arrangement, and Ellen
stated
to him that Mrs. Allen had just
received
a letter from Emily, in which,
without expressly allowing that she was
unhappy, she betrayed discontentIt
professed to be written merely to
inform
her grandmother that `she was
well, and that she hoped she was
enjoying
the same blessing;' she said `it was
a big cross she had taken up; that all that
called themselves shakers, were not
shakers indeed; that wherever there were
true disciples, there was also a Judas;
that she had many thoughts of her
grandmother
,
and sometimes it was so much in
her heart to go home to her, that she
believed that she had a call to leave
the people; but that her elder sister,
who was gifted to interpret, told her such
thoughts were temptation.' The
conclusion
of the letter, Ellen said, was
evidently
drenched with the poor girl's
tears. She had written one sentence
repeatedly, and as often crossed it out;
they had been able, after many vain
attempts
,
to decipher it; it ran thus:
I send my kind remembrance, as in
duty bound, to James Lenox, for all his
goodness to my natural brother, and to
me in times past: tell James also, that if
he knew what trouble some people have,
he would not blame them, but he would
pity them from his heart.
This, Sir, continued Ellen, is to
you an unmeaning jargon; but we, from
our knowledge of poor Emily, infer from
it that she is tired of her unnatural
seclusion
;
that her early attachment to
James has revived, in spite of her dutiful
efforts to extinguish it; and we have
fears that she is suffering persecution in
some way which she dare not
communicate
.
The letter must have been written
and conveyed away secretly, as it was
post-marked `Albany;' and the
experienced
ones would never have permitted
such a document to issue from their
retreat.'
And why, asked Mr. Redwood,
should this letter occasion your
departure
?
It has been determined in a family
conference, replied Ellen, that an
effort shall be made to rescue Emily.
James, who in truth has long loved her,
is most earnest in her cause. He frankly
avows his attachment, but is afraid of
appearing in the enterprise, lest Emily
should be persuaded by her spiritual
guides that he is an emissary from the
arch enemy. Deborah, who looks upon
herself as a natural protector of the weak
and oppressed, has volunteered a crusade
to the shakers, provided I will
accompany
her. She has an extraordinary
confidence in my influence with Emily
and with Susan too, the `elder sister.'
Mr. Redwood inquired `if it were
possible that she would undertake such
an enterprise with no protector but
Deborah
?'
Ellen assured him `that nothing was
more common or safe, than for females
to travel from one extremity of
New-England
to the other, without any other
safeguard than the virtue and civility of
the inhabitants; that where there was
no danger there was no need of
protection
,
and that for her own part she should
esteem her good friend Deborah's right
arm as sufficient a defence for these
modern
times, as a gallant knight or baron
bold would have been in the days of
danger and of chivalry.'
Mr. Redwood ventured to hint, that
although Miss Debby might be a sturdy
protector, she certainly was a ludicrous
chaperone for a young lady.
Ellen frankly confessed that she felt a
little squeamishness on that account:
but, Sir, said she, I never could
forgive myself, if I permitted a foolish
scruple of that kind to prevent me from
rendering an essential service to the
Allens. I owe them a vast debt, and I
have small means to pay it.
Mr. Redwood commended her motive,
and half an hour after was perhaps glad
that it controlled her, but at this moment
his reluctance to part with her overcame
his apprehension that she might possibly
interfere with the accomplishment of his
favourite projecthe earnestly urged
delay; but Ellen said there were
domestic
reasons for their going at once
which she could not oppose.
Then, my dear Miss Bruce, if I
must part with you, allow me to say that
I feel an interest almost paternal in the
issue of your hopesnot the generous
hopes you are indulging for this little
shaker girl, but those which relate to the
development of your own history. Oh
Ellen! he continued with emotion, and
fixing his melancholy eye steadfastly on
her, you little dream of the
supernatural
power your face possesses over my
feelingsmy memory: there are thoughts
that quite unman me; he clasped his
hands and was silent, while Ellen awaited
in amazement and trembling expectation
what he should next say: but after a
moment's pause, he resumed his
composure
and proceeded in his ordinary tone.
Your society, Ellen, has been a cordial
to my weary spirit. I have worn out the
world; but here in this still place, amid
F 3
these quiet scenes, where the sweet spirit
of contentment dwells, here, he added,
taking Ellen's hand, where I have seen
that it is possible to forego the display of
talent and the gratification of taste, to
practise the obscure virtues which are
the peculiar boast of your religionthe
virtues silent and secret, that neither ask
nor expect earthly notice or reward
here I have felt a new influenceI have
seemed to breathe a purer, a heavenly
airand I have sometimes hoped
What, Sir, what? exclaimed Ellen,
eagerly.
That you would make a convert of
me, my sweet friend.
Would to heaven! said Ellen.
Nay, replied Mr. Redwood,
mournfully
shaking his head, I believe it is
too late. It is a beautiful illusion; but
I have outlived all illusions, Ellen: the
man cannot return to the leading-strings
of infancyhe cannot unlearn his
philosophy
he
cannot forget his experience.
But he can examine if his philosophy
be the true oneOh, Mr. Redwood
Ellen blushed and faltered, her heart was
overflowingbut the natural timidity of
a woman in the presence of a man, her
elder and her superior, restrained her:
she was frightened at her own daring
and while she hesitated, Mr. Redwood
said, spare yourself any farther trouble
about me, EllenI am too rigid to bend
to a new yoke. It would be as
impossible
for me to adopt your faith as for you
to assume the manacles of your friend
Susan Allen. But I am not cruel
enough to wish to weaken your hopes
we will waive this subjectdo you go
without seeing the Westalls?
Yes, Sir, we go early.
I am sorry for it; they will regret it
they both esteem you, Miss Bruce.
We must all support your departure as
well as we canwhen you are gone,
much as I like the Lenoxes, I shall no
longer find it impossible to tear myself
away. The Westalls will I hope
accompany
us to New-York and Philadelphia,
perhaps to Virginia. Westall shall never
leave us if we can detain him. Ellen,
you are worthy of all confidence, and I
will venture to tell you, what indeed you
may have already discerned, that I am
extremely desirous to ally my daughter
with Charles Westall. You look grave
you do not think Caroline worthy so
happy a destiny?
Mr. Redwood perceived that Ellen
was embarrassed, and he proceeded, I
will not tax your sincerity, Miss Bruce;
my daughter has faults, great faults
still she has splendid attractions: her
beauty might gratify the pride of any
manher fortune is immenseand if
she has faults, why I know no one so
likely to cure them as Charles Westall.
I have not, I confess, as yet observed
any indications of a particular interest
in her; but she has insinuated in a
conversation
that we have had together, that
she has it in her power to receive or
reject him.
Ellen walked to the window and threw
up the sash. You look pale, Miss
Bruce, are you not well? continued
Mr. Redwood.
Perfectly well, she replied, but
the evening is oppressively warm.
I was not aware of that, said Mr.
Redwood, shivering as the chill air blew
on him from the window.
I believe it is not very warm,
replied
Ellen, closing the window. I
am a little fatigued with the preparations
for our journey, she added, re-seating
herself with her face averted from Mr.
Redwood.
I will detain you but one moment
longer, Miss Bruce; should you from
your own observations conclude that
Westall was interested in my daughter?
I cannot say, SirI know nothing
of the manners of the world.
It is not necessary you should:
women
have an instinct on this subject that
surpasses the sagacity of experiencetell
me then frankly the result of your
observations
.
Ellen after making a vain effort to
reply
with composure, stammered out, that
Miss Redwood certainly must know,
and Miss Redwood had saidHere
she hesitated again, and Mr. Redwood
compassionating her embarrassment,
said, you are right, Ellen; you are too
prudent to flatter my wishes.
Ellen, anxious to avail herself of this
moment, rose, and giving Mr. Redwood
her hand, bade him farewell; he
reiterated
his expression of interest and
kindness
,
and they parted. Poor girl!
thought Mr. Redwood, as she closed the
door; it is as I suspected: the most
virtuous seem always the most persecuted
by destiny. Why should another thorn
be planted in her innocent bosom?
Mr. Redwood felt a consciousness that
he might avert the destiny he deprecated
he had virtue for good emotions, but
not for the difficult sacrifice of a
favourite
object. Believing as he had, that the
best owe most of their virtue to the
applause
of society, or to the flattery of
their little world; the unostentatious
goodness of Ellen (dignified as he deemed
her by talents and improvement) had
made a deep and ineffaceable impression
on him. He sate for a long time
meditating
on her character and singular
history
;
he thought that if there were ever
two beings formed to make a joyous path
over this wilderness world, they were
Ellen and Westall. He reproached
himself
with wishing to interpose his plans
to frustrate such possible happiness. He
thought he never came in contact with
the good and lovely without inflicting
suffering on them.
It had been Mr. Redwood's destiny
through life to feel right and to act
wrongto see and to feel, deeply feel,
the beauty of virtue, but to resign
himself
to the convenience or expediency of
wrong. His impulses were goodbut
what is impulse without principle? what
is it to resist the eternal solicitations of
selfishness, the sweeping tempests of
passion?
Mr. Redwood had an unconquerable
wish to bestow some benefit on Ellen.
He had none in his power but of a
pecuniary
nature, and that it was difficult to
offer without offending her delicacy. He
determined, however, to do it, and he
enclosed bank notes to the amount of
five hundred dollars in the following
note:
My dear Miss Bruce must not
punish my temerity in offering her the
enclosed, by refusing to accept it. Being
a parent, I understand the wants of a
young ladyallow me then to act as the
representative of your father. By
permitting
me now and in future to supply
those vulgar wants, from which none of us
are exempt, you will make me a convert
to the common opinion, that a rich man
is enviable.
After sealing the pacquet, he gave it
to Deborah with a request that she would
not deliver it until after she and her
companion
had left Eton.
Ellen retired to her room to occupy
herself with the preparations for her
journey. Her wardrobe was simple, but
neat, and not inelegant. It had been
amply furnished, not only with
necessaries
,
but with the little luxuries of a lady's
equipage, by Mrs. Harrison, from the
abundant stores of her youthful and
prosperous days. The costume in which
a lady of fortune had figured twenty
years gone by, would have been quite
too antique, but, happily, Ellen's taste
and ingenuity enabled her gracefully to
adapt it to her own person and the
fashion of the day. The journey she
was about to undertake was a long one,
and, in obedience to the wise caution of
Mrs. Lenox, she prepared for any delay
that might occurr; a prudence enforced
by Deborah, who said that as she had not
journied for twenty years, she should not
hurry home. After packing her trunk,
she made a safe corner in it for her
casket
,
little dreaming that the spirit was
not there. She had never been
separated
from it since it was first transferred
to her possession. She locked her trunk,
arranged her dressing case, and took up
her Bible to place in ita beautiful little
Bible with gold clasps, the gift too of
Mrs. Harrison. Her recent conversation
with Mr. Redwood made her feel its
value
,
particularly at this moment. Her
eye glistened while she kissed it with an
emotion of gratitude at the thought of
the solace it had been, and would be to
her. Such emotions prove that religious
sufferers have a compensation for their
trials. A wish suddenly arose in Ellen's
mind that she could impart the truths
and consolations of that book to Mr.
Redwood. The thought seemed like
inspiration. If she was enthusiastic, who
can blame an enthusiasm so benevolent?
She wrapped the book with this short
note in an envelope:My dear Mr.
Redwood, accept and value this treasure
for the sake of your friend Ellen Bruce,
may I not say for your own sakeGod
bless you.
She left the pacquet with Mrs. Lenox
to be delivered after her departure. As
she was returning to her own room she
heard Westall's voice in the parlour: he
had come back with some message from
his mother for Miss Redwood. Ellen
obeyed the first impulse of her feeling,
and moved towards the parlour door:
she felt her heart beating violently, and
surprised and alarmed at her own
agitation
,
she retreated reluctantly to her
apartment. `Perhaps,' she thought,
`Mr. Redwood will tell him that I am
going away, and he will ask to see me'
but soon after she heard him shut the
parlour doorheard him go out of the
houseand at the last sound of his
retiring
footsteps she burst into tears;
shocked at the discovery of her own
feelings, she hastily undressed, and threw
herself on the bed in the hope that sleep
would dispel the images that crowded
her mind, but sleep she could not. In
the multitude of her thoughts; her
anxiety
for Emily, her concern at leaving
Mrs. Allen, her regret at parting with
Mr. Redwood, there was still one that
predominated over every other. Was it
possible that Westall, pure, excellent,
elevated as he was, could love Caroline
Redwood? or worsenot loving, could
he marry her? It must be soif it were
not, all womanly feeling would have
forbidden the communication Caroline
had made to her father. Ellen tried to
persuade herself that she had no other
interest in it than that benevolent one
which it was natural and right to feel in
Westall's happiness: but alas! the
melancholy
result of her `maiden meditation,'
was that she was
not
`fancy free;' and,
involuntarily, she covered her face with
her hands as if she would have hidden
from her own consciousness the tears
and blushes which the discovery cost
her.
At this moment she was startled by a
loud shriek from Caroline. She sprang
to her bedside, and Caroline grasping her
arm, stared wildly at her, as if the
phantom
that had scared her sleep had not
yet vanished.
You were dreaming, Miss Redwood.
Dreaming! was I dreaming? said
Caroline, still continuing her fixed gaze
on Ellen, bring the light nearer, Ellen.
Yes, thank God! I was dreaming.
What dream, Miss Redwood, could
thus terrify you?
Oh Ellen, I thought I saw you and
Westall standing together on the
summit
of that rock on the lake-shore; and
there was a soft silvery cloud floating
just over you, it parted, and I saw a
beautiful spiritual creature bending from
it; her garments of light floated on the
bright cloud; she had a chaplet of white
flowers in her hand like those you
plucked for me: while I was gazing to
see if she would place it on your head;
the earth trembled where I stood, a
frightful chasm yawned before me, and
my father was hurling me into it, when
I awoke.
It was a strange dream, said Ellen,
with a melancholy smile.
How strange, Miss Bruce? can you
read dreams? have you faith in them?
Not the least; and it is well for
me that I have not, for in this case, as
dreams are interpreted by contraries,
you would be on the rock and I in the
chasm.
That is true, replied Caroline; but
it was, as you say, a strange dream;
even now I see his eye bent on you.
Whose eye? inquired Ellen, who
began to think Caroline had really lost
her senses.
Westall's, she replied, her brow
again contracting.
Your dream then is already working
by rule, for his eye will never be bent
on me again.
Never, what do you mean, Miss
Bruce?
Ellen explained to Caroline that
she was to leave Eton in the morning,
and should not return for some weeks.
Thank God! exclaimed Caroline,
springing from the bed, entirely unable
to control the relief she felt from Ellen's
information.
Ellen rose also: she said nothing, but
her face expressed so plainly: In what
have I offended? that after a moment's
pause, Caroline proceeded to say, It is
in vain, Ellen Bruce, it is useless longer
to conceal my feelings towards you,
sleeping or waking they are always the
same; from the first moment that we
met, you have in every way injured me,
crossed my purposes, baffled my hopes,
and all under cover of such artlessness,
such simplicity. Above all things I hate
hypocrisy, and I will have the
satisfaction
of telling you before you go that I
at least have seen through your disguises,
and neither set you down for an innocent
nor a saint.
Ellen was confounded with this
sudden
burst of passion. I know not,
Miss Redwood, she said, calmly, what
you mean by your insinuations. I know
not how I have interfered with you: but
one thing I know, that your opinion,
determined as you are to misunderstand
and misrepresent me, ought not
cannot
affect my happiness.
Lord bless me, how heroic! but
there is one whose opinion
may
possibly
affect your happiness. Mrs. Westall
sees through you as plainly as I do, and
if she can help it, I assure you you will
not succeed in wheedling her son out of
his affections and senses with all your
pretty romantic devices.
My devices! oh, Miss Redwood,
you are cruelwhat are my devices?
Really, Miss Ellen Bruce, you
flatter
yourself they have all passed current
with us simple onesthe trumpery story
about the boxa fine Arabian night's
entertainment, truly; your dragging that
old woman day after day into the parlour
to practise your benevolence upon, as
the milliners display their fashions on
their blocks; the pretty tale of the blind
girl, admirably got up to be sure, with a
hundred other inferior instances of your
mode of practice upon the romantic
unsuspecting
Westall.
Ellen could have borne unmoved
Caroline's
malice, but the thought of the
odious light in which she should be
presented
to Westall quite overcame her
VOL. II. G
fortitude. I could not have believed
Mrs. Westall so ungenerousso unjust,
said she, bursting into tears.
`Ah,' thought Caroline, `I have
touched the vulnerable spot;' and she
would have proceeded with savage
barbarity
in the application of her tortures,
but she was interrupted. Mrs. Lenox
tapped at the door to say that Deborah
was in readiness, and to beg Ellen to
despatch her preparations.
Mrs. Lenox's voice operated as a
sedative
upon Caroline: she sat down and
fixed her eyes on Ellen, while she with
trembling hands proceeded to array
herself
for her departure. When every
thing was in readiness, she approached
Caroline, and said with a faltering voice,
Miss Redwood, I forgive you; may
God forgive your unkind, unnatural
treatment of one who never injured you
in thought, word, or deed. I would ask
you to spare me when I am gone, but I
have no reason to hope for that. To
God, she continued, with a solemnity
that appalled Caroline, to God, my
father and my friend, I commit my cause
I have no earthly protector, and I need
none. We part for ever; this
for ever
compasses the limit of our earthly career,
and brings us to that presence where we
must next meet, where all injustice will
be exposedall wrong repaired.
Caroline had covered her eyes as if to
shut out the vision of innocence and
loveliness. Ellen's words touched her
with a feeling of remorse, and awakened
appalling fears: her passions were
turbulent
,
but not yet hardened into the
resolution of one inured to the practice
of evil. As Ellen turned from her she
started from the bed and exclaimed,
stay, Ellen Bruce, staygive me one
moment's time. Ellen paused and
looked
at her with mute amazement, while
she walked the room in the agony of
indecision
.
Among other valuable branches
of education, Caroline had been taught to
G 2
believe in dreams and all their train of
vain imaginations; her fancy had been
excited by the airy nothings of the night's
vision. Ellen's last words struck upon
her ear like the voice of prophecy. She
imagined that her innocent victim was
wrested from her, and that she beheld
the visible interposition of Heaven in
her behalfthat chasm, that dark deep
frightful chasm, yawned before her, and
the thought that she could in no way
close it up but by the restoration of the
rifled treasure came to her like an
impulse
from a good spirit: obedient to it
she had risen from the bed, but she
faltered
in the execution of her good
purpose
;
she shrunk from the train of evils
that her busy thoughts suggested: the
certain loss of WestallEllen's
advancement
to fortune, rank and fashion equal
to her ownthe exposure of her own
basenessthat she could not brook; and
`I cannot humble myself to
her
,' was the
mental conclusion of her deliberations
`When she is gone, I can, if I choose,
restore the articles as secretly as I took
them; the discovery will then be delayed
Westall secured.'
This feeble intention to render
imperfect
justice quieted her conscience:
while she was deliberating what gloss
she should put on her mysterious
conduct
,
Deborah opened the door.
Heyday
,
said she, are you up, Miss
Caroline
?
well, I am glad of it, you will have
a chance to see the sun rise once in your
life; and when he comes sailing over
those hills, and pours a shower of light
on Champlain, you'll own there is not
such a sight in all the Car'linas: good
luck, and a husband to you, girl. Come,
Ellen, come, what signifies losing any
more lost time?
Ellen assured Deborah she was quite
ready; and Deborah, who would not on
compulsion have performed a menial
service for a queen, took Ellen's trunk
in her arms, and commanding her to
follow `with the nick-nacks,' she left
the apartment.
Ellen looked inquiringly at Caroline:
I have nothing farther to say, Miss
Bruce.
Then, farewell, said Ellen.
Caroline
bowed, and they parted.
CHAPTER XIII.
Lassie, say thon lo'est me,
Or if thou wilt na be my ain,
Say na thou'lt refuse me.
Burns
.
The
breakfast was soon despatched,
and our travellers, after receiving many
wise cautions from Mrs. Lenox, and
earnest injunctions from James, mounted
into an old-fashioned chaise, and
commenced
their journey.
We hope our romantic readers will not
regret that our heroine could not be
accommodated
with a more poetical or
dignified vehicle. They ought rather to
rejoice that she did not fall upon these
evil times, when, beyond a doubt, she
would have been compelled to perform
the journey in a one-horse waggona
`kill-devil'or, to give it its original and
appropriate designationa dear-born;
so called from the illustrious author of
the invention; a vehicle that commends
itself so strongly to the social temper of
the Yankees, that it has in the interior of
New-England nearly superseded the use
of every other carriage drawn by one
horse.
Our travellers had proceeded a few
miles, when Deborah thought she might
give Ellen the pacquet with which she
had been entrusted, without violating the
letter of Mr. Redwood's direction. Her
surprise surpassed Ellen's when she
beheld
its contents. She begged her to
read the letter aloud.Ellen read it with
a trembling voice. The Lord bless his
dear heart! exclaimed Deborah.
Oh Ellen, I wish he had you for his
child, instead of that ; never mind,
I'll overlook her for the sake of her
fathercount the money, girl, count it,
you can't, she added, looking at Ellen,
whose eyes were overflowing, give
it to me: my sight is rather dull too,
and she dashed off the tears that clouded
her vision, five hundred is it! you are
rich, you are an heiress, Ellen.
I am, indeed, replied Ellen, rich
in kind friends, but this money, Miss
Deborah, must be returned.
Returned! echoed Debby; why,
you would not be such a born fool, girl?
a thirsty man might as well pour back a
draught he had taken from a fountain.
No, no, Ellen, when the rich give, let
the poor receive and be thankful; that is
always encouragement to them to go on.
Returned, indeed! it would be a
slighting
o' Providence to return it, Ellen
quite out of all reason and nature. Just
like one of Mrs. Harrison's superstitious
high-flown notions.
It was impossible for Ellen to
communicate
all the motives that led her to
decline a pecuniary favour from Miss
Redwood's father; but she suggested
G 3
reasons which she thought would appeal
to her companion's characteristic
independence
.
The veteran maiden opposed
them allshe had advanced into the cold
climate of worldly prudence, but Ellen
was at that age when sentiment controls
interest. In vain Debby continued her
remonstrances. Ellen, heedless of them
all, wrote with a pencil an affecting
expression
of her gratitude on the envelope
of the pacquet, and reversing it, she
directed
it to Mr. Redwood, intending to
procure at the next village a trusty
person
to re-convey it to Eton.
The travellers had just reached a small
brook which intercepted the road: there
was a bridge over it, and a road by the
side of the bridge, by which passengers
descended to the brook for the purpose
of watering their horses. Deborah thought
it was time to perform that kind office for
her steed; she alighted to arrange the
bridle, and desiring Ellen to drive through
the stream, said she would herself walk
up the hill on the other side. The
passage
to the brook was shaded and hidden
by thick clumps of willow trees. As
Ellen reined her horse into the narrow
way, she encountered Westall, who had
gone out on horse-back for a morning
ride.
Miss Bruce, is it possible? he
exclaimed
,
with a tone and expression of
delight that changed instantly on noticing
her riding dress, and other indications of
travelling. Where, he continued, are
you going; what can be the reason of
your sudden departure?
Ellen communicated as briefly as
possible
the object of her journey, and the
place of her destination. In the
meantime
the poor beast, quite at a loss to
account for the restraint put upon his
movements, and not a whit inclined to
play Tantalus in full view of the pure
tempting rivulet, threw up his head,
pawed the dust, and showed all the signs
of impatience common on such occasions.
Ellen, usually sufficiently accomplished
in the art of driving, now, from some
cause or other, seemed as maladroit as
most women: she pulled the wrong rein,
and was, or Westall thought she was, in
imminent danger of an overturn. He
dismounted from his horse, and
springing
into the chaise beside her, took upon
himself the conduct of affairs. He then,
with laudable discretion, permitted the
animal to drink, and drove him to the
opposite bank, before the conversation
was renewed. As he paused there, Ellen
said, with the best voice she could
command
,
I thank you for your assistance;
I must proceed nowDeborah waits for
me.
For heaven's sake! he replied, let
her waitI cannot, I will not part with
you, till I have laid open my heart to
you.
It is unnecessaryI already have
heard from Mr. Redwood what you would
say, replied Ellen, confused, and
shrinking
from the communication, which her
conversation with Mr. Redwood the
preceding
evening led her to anticipate.
From Mr. Redwood? exclaimed
Westall, impossible! has he then read
my soul!
Not he, but his daughter, answered
Ellen.
His daughter! reiterated Westall,
and was proceeding to entreat Ellen
to explain herself, when they were
both startled by a hoarse and impatient
call from Deborah, who was evidently
drawing near to them with rapid
strides.
Ellen! she screamed, Ellen Bruce,
you'll founder the horse; drive out of the
brook, girl, if he has not drank it dry
already.
The lovers were too much confounded
to make any reply, and Deborah,
apprehending
some fatal disaster to Ellen,
doubled her speed, and darting into the
path that led to the watering place,
quickly arrived in full view of the objects
of her search and alarm. There is, to
the best natured, something irresistibly
provoking in the apparent tranquillity of
those who have produced within them
all the tumult of anxiety. Deborah, at
a single glance, ascertained the safety of
Ellen, and of the horse, and approaching
the latter, she patted him, saying, I
think you have the most sense of the
three; if you had not been dumb, poor
beast, you would not have let me run the
breath out of my body without answering
me a word.
Charles Westall, though his mind was
on other thoughts intent, could not but
smile at the indirect reproach of Debby,
which their truly lover-like forgetfulness
of her and of every thing else so justly
merited. Forgive me, Miss Deborah,
he said, springing from the chaise,
your horse was restive, and I assumed
your seat to aid Miss Bruce, who was
quite unequal to managing him.
You are a great manager, truly,
replied Deborah, half smiling and half
vexed: the beast seems as quiet now
as you could wish him. Is it your will
and pleasure, Miss Ellen, to proceed?
Certainly, replied Ellen.
Well, come, Mr. Westall, continued
Deborah, whose heat of body and mind
had already subsided, we won't part in
angeryoung folks must be young folks.
Farewell, and a long and a happy life to
you.
Stay one moment, Miss Deborah, I
have a favour to begI have something
to say to Miss Bruce. Miss Bruce, he
added, turning to Ellen, I entreat you
to grant me a few momentsit may be
the last favour I shall ever ask of you
Miss Deborah will drive slowly up the
hillthe path is shaded from the
morning
sunyou will not find the walk
unpleasant
You forget, young man, interposed
Debby, which way the sun shines this
morning; when I came down the road,
it was hot enough to boil all the blood
in my veins
Ellen, continued Westall,
unheeding
in his eagerness Deborah's cross-cut,
do not, do not deny me this favour.
Why, Ellen, said Debby, what
ails you girl why should you deny it?
This was too direct a question to be
answered in any way but by compliance.
Some gleams of light had flashed athwart
Ellen's mind, that rendered her less
reluctant
than she had been at the onset,
to listen to a communication from
Westall
.
She suffered him to hand her out
of the chaise; and Deborah, assuming
the reins, and setting off the horse `en
connoisseur,' said, she had the advantage
now, for if they forgot her, she could ride
instead of walking back.
The moments were too few and
precious
to be wasted in circumlocution.
Westall, after saying he was sure there
was some misunderstanding  Caroline
Redwood was the last person in the world
to whom he should confide any sentiment
that interested him, proceeded to make
a frank declaration of the unqualified
affection which Ellen had inspired. When
he paused Ellen made no reply; and he
proceeded, while he urged his suit, to
say, with the consistency usual on such
occasions, that he knew he had no right
to expect a return, that her abrupt
departure
alone could, and that must,
justify
his obtruding on her his feelings and
his hopes, after so brief an acquaintance.
Ellen was all simplicity and truth, and
in other circumstances she would not,
she could not have withheld from Westall
the confession that would have been to
himheaven to hear. She had not a
particle of coquetry, and she would not
have delayed the confession for a
moment
for the pleasure of feeling her
power. Various feelings struggled for
mastery in her bosom; first, and perhaps
ruling every other, was the delightful
consciousness of possessing Westall's
affections; then came the thought of the
mystery that hung over her parentage
it had never before inflicted such an
exquisite
pang as at this moment; and last
and most painful, was the remembrance
of Mrs. Westall's unkind suspicions, and
of the malicious interpretation Caroline
Redwood had given to her actions.
While she hesitated in what terms to
reply
,
Westall said, there is then, Ellen,
no feeling in your heart that pleads for
my rashness?
It is indeed rashness, after so brief
an acquaintance, to commit your
happiness
Oh, Ellen, interrupted Westall, I
meant rather presumption that
rashness
.
Whatever it is, let us both forget
it, replied Ellen, in a tone of affected
calmness that would have indicated
repressed emotion to a cooler observer
than Westall; it is time that we should
part, and we must part as we met
strangers.
Have you not, then, Ellen, a spark
of kindness for me, which years of the
most devoted affection and service might
kindle? Is there not the slightest
foundation
on which I might rest a hope for
the future?
Ellen, in a broken voice, alluded to the
possibility that her name was a
dishonoured
one; a possibility, she said,
which ought to set an impassable
barrier
to her affections.
Westall protested and entreated. If,
he said, the worst she could apprehend
should prove true, it should be the
business
,
the happiness of his life to make
her forget it.
Ellen felt that her scruples were
yielding
to the impetuous feeling of her lover.
Who can resist the pleadings of
tenderness
when they coincide with the secret,
the strongest, though the resisted
inclinations
of the heart? She was silent for
some time, and when she did speak, her
voice was faltering, and her opposition
such as a lover might hope to overcome.
Westall's hopes were re-animated, and he
pressed his suit more eagerly than ever.
At least, he said, Ellen, delay this
journey one day; do not now make an
irrevocable decision; return to Eton;
let my mother join her entreaties to
mine.
The thought of Westall's mother
re-invigorated
Ellen's dying resolution.
Urge me no farther, Mr. Westall,
said she, I have not been so happy as
to obtain your mother's esteem, and were
every other obstacle removed, I never
would obtrude myself on her undesired;
nonor unsolicited.
My mother, Ellen?But the
assurance
of his mother's favour, which he
was about instinctively to pronounce,
was checked by the consciousness of the
real state of the case.My mother,
Ellen, he continued, in a subdued tone,
has been dazzled by gilded dreams long
indulgedbut she is kind, affectionate
and will, I am certain, be easily
reconciled
to any step on which she knows my
happiness depends.
It would not, replied Ellen, be
very consolatory to me if she should
become
reconciled to an inevitable evil.
I have already listened too long, she
added, and casting her eye towards
Deborah, who had halted under the
broad shadow of an elm tree on the
summit
of the hill, she hurried forward.
Can you, said Westall, when you
see how you afflict me, thus hasten from
me without a regret?
Ellen could not trust her voice to
answer; but when she had reached the
chaise, she turned and gave him her
hand: her eloquent face (not governed
by the law she had imposed on her
tongue) expressed any thing but
insensibility
.
God reward you, she said,
for your generous purposewe must
now part.
And to meet again, replied Westall,
while he fervently kissed the hand she
had extended to him, as surely as
there is truth in heaven.
Ellen sunk back into her seat, and hid
her face with her handkerchief, while
honest Debby, heartily sympathising in
the evident affliction of the lovers, said
in a whining voice, that contrasted
ludicrously
enough with her customary
harsh tone, Good bye to you, Mr.
Westallgood bye to you, Sirit is
hard parting; but keep a good heart
we shall all three meet again in the
Lord's own time. After having uttered
this consolatory expression of her trust
in Providence, she gave the whip to her
steed, and set off with a speed that
promised
to make up for lost time. After
driving a few yards she stopped again,
and calling to Westall, who was still
standing as if rivetted to the spot on
which they had left him, she threw out
Mr. Redwood's packet, saying, These,
with all care and speed, to Squire
Redwood
;
then kindly nodding, she drove
on.
Deborah exercised on this occasion
that discretion resulting from good sense
and good feeling, which in all its
modifications
still preserves the convenient
designation
of
tact:
she left Ellen to the
operation of her feelings, without
molesting
her with a remark or inquiry. Ellen
resigned herself for a little while to
emotions
the more violent for having been
repressed. The same fountain had to
her sent forth sweet and bitter waters.
If the uncertainty of her fate, and the
anguish of parting with Westall were
evils nearly intolerable, there was a
heart-cheering consciousness of the
treasure
she had acquired in his affections
there was the sweetest consolation in the
thought that there was one who felt with
her and for her; and the recollection of
Westall's last words was like the bright
gleam along the western horizon, that,
smiling in triumph at the dark
overhanging
clouds, speaks a sure promise of a
fair coming day.
As for Westall, after the few first
moments of absolute despair, he began
to think the case not quite desperate;
and though Ellen had not spoken a word
of encouragement on which he might
suspend a hope, neither had she said or
intimated that there existed in her
feelings
any obstacle to his wishes; there
were certain tones and expressions which
are the universal language of tenderness,
that he had noticed, and which he now
laid up in his memory and cherished
there, as the faithful fix their eyes on
the twilight of prophecy.
In the course of the morning, Charles
Westall joined the circle at Mr. Lenox's,
whither his mother had already gone.
He perceived that the tone of the ladies'
spirits was raised, (as was indeed too
plain) by Ellen's departure.
Westall delivered to Mr. Redwood the
packet with which he had been entrusted.
Mr. Redwood received it with evident
surprise, and said, You have then seen
Miss Bruce this morning? All eyes
were now fixed on Westall, who,
colouring
deeply, replied, that he had met
her accidentally during his morning
ride.
Miss Bruce is quite a character,
said Caroline; every thing connected
with her is involved in an interesting
veil of mystery;par exampleyour
son, Mrs. Westall, cannot speak of
meeting
her even
accidentally
, without the
most portentous blushes; and there is,
my dear fatherthe very soul of
frankness
thrusting
into his pocket a bundle
of private communications received from
this same fair one. Upon my word it is
a pity she had not flourished at a court,
she would have made a pretty intri

your favourite Moliere describes, papa,

Et jusques au bon jour, il dit tout a l'oreille.

[2]
He swells each trifle to a wonder's height,
And takes his friend aside, to say, `good night.'
Mr. Redwood darted an angry look
on his daughter, and changing his
purpose
,
he tore off the envelope, and threw
the bank-notes on the table, saying, at
the same time, behold the solution of
the mystery that provokes your wit,
Caroline
.
I offered Ellen Bruce a little of
that which gives us all our boasted
superiority
to her, and she declined
receiving
it
With the advice and consent of
counsel, no doubt, answered Caroline,
glancing her eye at Charles Westall.
Wrath is cruel, and anger is
out-rageous
,
but who is able to stand before
envy?rose to Westall's lips; he had
the grace, however, to suppress it, and
to say in a calm tone, Miss Bruce is
her own best counsellor.
Doubtless, replied Caroline, Miss
Bruce is wondrous wise; but she is not
the first divinity who has admitted
mortals
to her deliberations.What say you,
Mrs. Westall? Does not your son look
guilty of aiding and abetting this most
dignified refusal of my father's
extraordinary
patronage?
If I look guilty of aught, said
Westall, but the involuntary fault of
listening to an implication against Miss
Bruce, my face does me great injustice.
Really, Caroline, my love, said
Mrs. Westall, in the hope of averting
observation from her son, and perceiving
the necessity of turning Miss Redwood
from her pursuit, your raillery is quite
too much for Charles this morning: I
must interpose my maternal shield. What
say you to a truce and a ride?
A truce, certainly; for I am too
H 2
generous to fight with one hors du
combat
,
and a ride with all my heart,
answered
Caroline, provided Mr.
Westall
is not fatigued by his
accidental
morning
escortexcursion, I mean.
Mr. Westall, with more gravity than
gallantry, and in spite of his mother's
entreating looks, said that he must
resign
the privilege vouchsafed to him, to
fulfil an engagement in the village
and on this pretext he left the party to
pursue their design, while he gave the
rein to his own meditations.
CHAPTER XIV.
Who made the heart, 'tis
he
alone
Decidedly can try us;
He knows each chordits various tone,
Each springits various bias.
Burns
.
We
must now leave the party at Eton,
which we hope that our readers will
think has lost its chief interest since the
departure of our heroine, and we shall
exempt them from attending her in her
wearisome progress, since it was
diversified
by no danger real or imaginary, to
recall their attention to the sorrows of
the simple amiable little fanatic Emily
Allen.
She returned to her monastic seclusion
with her aunt, or as she called her (
according
to the fashion of the Believers,
who acknowledge none but primitive
titles and relations,) her `elder sister,'
more from a habit of passive obedience,
than from any distaste to the world.
Our readers may recollect that at parting
with James Lenox, she had received
from him a slip of paper, and succeeded
in hiding it in her bosom. He had
written on it a strong expression of his
love, and an entreaty that she would
abandon her false religion. From the
moment she placed it in her bosom, her
heart fluttered and struggled as an
imprisoned
bird when her mate approaches
her cage. She regarded it as a
temptation
,
but had no strength, hardly a wish
to resist it. All her solitary moments
(they were rare and brief) were devoted
to reading this note over and over again.
She felt herself immured in a dungeon,
and from this the only gleam of light
she could not for a moment turn her
thoughts.
The uniform habits and monotonous
occupations of this singular community
have a strong tendency to check every
irregular feeling, and to intercept every
vagrant desire. But in vain did Emily
try their sedative influence. She was
one of the highest, and even there,
where few distinctions obtain, most
privileged order, called, par excellence,
`the church.' Susan's gifts had
advanced
her to the lead, and Emily's
graces were looked upon by the
fraternity
as the herald blossoms of like
precious
fruit. But since her return from
her fatal visit to the world's people,
she had become an object of intense
anxiety to Susan, and of solicitude or
distrust to the rest of the society. Susan
had no suspicion of the real cause of her
discontent; she imputed it to the
workings
of her natural affections, the dying
sparks of which, not quite extinguished
by grace, had been rekindled by her late
visit to her kindred.
Little did this stern enthusiast imagine,
as she watched over her young disciple
with maternal tenderness, how much
there was of natural and original feeling
in her own affection for her. She saw
the bright colour, the beautiful signal of
youth and health, fading day by day
from her cheeks, till her face became
almost as white as the snowy cap border
that fringed it. She saw her take her
accustomed place at the formal meal, but
she noticed that her food was often
untasted
,
and never relished. She observed
her slow step and abstracted look, as she
passed over the broad flagstones to the
offices to perform her daily tasks, and
that though she went through them with
fidelity, her trembling hands and frequent
sighs evinced that her heart and strength
were gone. She uniformly appeared
with the sisters that thronged to the
evening worship, and went forth with
them to `labour in the dance,' but her
movements were heavy and mechanical;
and it was too plain, even to the lenient
judgment of Susan, that the spirit was
not there.
The kind-hearted old women, who
thought she was falling into a weakly
way, consulted with Susan as to the
nature
of her complaints. Susan humoured
their conjectures, and allowed them to
believe they had detected some latent
malady. They prepared their simples,
and Susan permitted Emily to swallow
them, because she knew them to be
innocent, and that they possessed that
best recommendation of any drug, viz.
that `if it does no good it can do no
harm.'
Some were of opinion that she had an
incipient consumption, some that it was
only a `drying of the lungs,' some
pronounced
it an `inward rheumatism,'
while others sagaciously intimated that
it might be a `palsy of the heart.' In
short the wise sisters discovered many
diseases that have not yet a place in the
H 3
nomenclature of the learned faculty;
and poor Emily, without a word of
remonstrance
or complaint, listened to
their skilful suggestions and tried all
their remedies, till their materia medica
was exhausted, without effect. She took
bitters fasting and feastingshe
swallowed
syrups `nine days' and `three
days,' and `every other day,'she took
conserves, and `health waters,' and `life
waters,' and every other water that
`with a blessing always cures'but still
she had the same deadly palenessthe
same sunken eyethe same trembling at
the heartand all the symptoms of a
mysterious disease, which the most
sagacious
deemed nothing short of a `
healing
gift' could cure.
The elder brethren, ever strict in their
watch over the young converts, now
became
alarmed in their turn. They held
frequent and long consultations, at which
Reuben Harrington had a gift to
preside
.
Whether these veterans derived
their light from the experience of similar
conflicts cannot be ascertained; but
certain
it is that they soon came to the
decision that Emily's disease was a moral
one; and to Reuben was assigned the
task of stilling her natural yearnings
after the world, and of bringing back
her wandering affections to the foldto
the wolf was committed the guardianship
of the lamb.
Reuben was aware that nothing could
be effected without the consent and
concurrence
of Susan; and to obtain that
to the mode of operation which he had
proposed to himself, he knew was no
easy matter, now that her natural
sagacity
was stimulated by strong affection
and deep anxiety.
After the brethren had closed their
deliberations, Reuben proposed calling
the elder sister to the conference, to
advise with her as to the best means of
pursuing their righteous end. Susan
came at his bidding; but she was
cautious
and reserved in her
communications
,
till one of the brethren roused her
by saying, (after a long low groan,) It
is evident the girl is given over to the
sifting of Satan,Susan raised her
eyes, and fixed them on the speaker
and, he continued, according to my
light, she should stand before the
congregation
of the people on the coming
Lord's day, and, in the presence of the
chosen vessels, receive an open rebuke
for sin.
What sin, Obadiah? inquired
Susan
with a trembling voice.
Sin of the heartdoth not all sin
proceed from the heart, woman?
Verily it doth, Obadiahbut who
hath seen the sin proceeding from the
heart of this afflicted child?and who
hath given you authority to discern the
thoughts and intents of the heart?
would you treat the young lambs like
the fat calves of the stall?
Nay, sister, this is unprofitable,
interposed Reuben. It is too true
that the fine gold has become dim, and
we must seek for a gift to restore its
brightness. Let us each labour for it in
the evening worship, and he or she to
whom it may be given shall forthwith
undertake the cure of this precious
soul.
Susan did not venture to withhold her
assent to this proposition, regarded as it
evidently was by the brethren as a direct
inspiration, but her spirit still hovered
over the child of her affection as a bird
fluttereth over her nest. My light has
been, she said, to leave Emily to the
work of time and gracebut it may be
that seeking, brethren, ye may find a
quicker cureit is a duty to remember
that in months past the testimony of the
child's life against all sin has been very
clear. The enemy has taken advantage
of her late visit to her kindred, and
has carried her back to the path of
natural
affection, out of which she had
travelled
farand seeing nature reviving,
and grace sleeping, he hath taken that
moment to bind her again with carnal
bonds.
You have ever been gifted, sister,
replied Reuben, with that hidden
wisdom
that quickly discerneth. It may be
you see the true evil; but even now I
can comfort you with a prophecy that
the young woman will awake as from
sleep, and break these carnal bonds like
threadher conflict is sore, but great
will be her victoryfor I predict of her
as Christian Love, the holy martyr of
Cromwell's time, predicted of our
mother
Anne, that this our young sister
shall yet shine out, `a
bright star
, whose
light and power shall make the heavens
to quake and knock under.'
Amen, exclaimed Susan, devoutly
clasping her hands; and amen
responded
all the veteran counsellors in
one voice, animated by that vaunted
spontaneous spirit of union which flows
through the whole bodywhen
governed
by a master spirit.
Susan, on issuing from the brethren's
apartment, passed through a narrow
passage
to the common entry from whence
all the passages diverge, and in the
centre
of which is placed a large clock, the
work of one of the ingenious brethren.
Emily stood at the foot of the staircase,
her face so much averted from Susan,
that she did not notice her approach,
her footsteps she could not hear, for it
is the law of the society which carries
its war with the flesh into the most
minute
particulars, that every one shall
tread softly, and shall shut the doors
with the least possible soundto these
laws such due observance is paid, that a
stranger ignorant of their habits, would
imagine their houses were untenanted.
Emily had paused at the staircase from
extreme weakness; the loud ticking of
the clock had arrested her attention;
this sound, always the same, seems like
the natural voice of this monotonous
solitude
.
Oh, said Emily,
unconsciously
uttering audibly her thoughts, to
what purpose is time measured here?
there is no pleasure to comethere is
none past that I dare to remember.
Do you ask to what purpose? said
Susan, in a voice of unwonted austerity
that startled Emily, and are you then
so far relapsed into nature!Oh, have
you already forgotten when every stroke
of that clock was as a holy monitor to
you, arousing you to redeem the time?
have you forgotten, Emily, when you
wrestled with vain thoughts, and sinful
thoughts, and overcame them?have you
forgotten, or do you tremble to
remember
when the stroke of every hour
carried
with it the record of your
innocence
.
Oh, spare me, spare me!
interrupted
the poor girl, grasping the elder
sister's arm, and clinging to it, I am
sickvery sick.
Susan's heart melted within her at
this appeal, and hearing the brethren
approaching, she instinctively drew, or
rather carried Emily away from their
observation, to her own apartment, the
door of which she closed, and turned a
button that secured her from intrusion.
She seated herself, and would have
placed Emily beside her, but she, as if
desperate now the veil had fallen, sunk
into Susan's lap, and folding her arms
around her, sobbed on her bosom.
This was the language of nature; and
the elder sister was surprised into what
she deemed an amazing sin. She wept
too freely and audibly, but
When she had wrestled down,
Feelings her nature strove to own,
and could command her voice, she said,
I thought all these natural affections
were rooted outand they were, Emily;
but since you came among us the enemy
hath sown tares among the wheat. Poor
child! I see where your temptation lies
the worldthe world calls you; but
be not discouraged, if you overcome the
temptation you will be stronger than one
that hath never been tempted. This is
not the first time that the serpent has
entered our garden. Long after I joined
myself to the people, my soul thirsted
after the world, as the hart panteth for
the water courses.
Emily, I have never told you my
trials, for I thought the world was as a
strange country to you; now you shall
know them all, and the Lord grant they
may prove a beacon to you!
Susan paused for a few moments, to
nerve her mind to the recollection and
detail of long past sorrows; and then
began in a calm subdued tone, while
Emily continued with her face hidden
on her bosom, sobbing at intervals like a
child that cannot forget its griefs.
Emily, I was the youngest of your
grandmother's seven children. My
natural
father was a good man, living up
to the light he had, till our mother Anne,
having had a safe path made for her
through the waters, came a swift witness
to this new world, which being, as it
were, born out of due time, was
accounted
worthy of her ministry, having been,
under Providence, discovered and
civilized
to become the inheritance of the
believers. My father, as you have often
heard, was one of the first fruits of the
work: he and my natural brothers and
sisters were among the first that joined
the people, and set out for the Lord. I
was left alone with your grandmother,
and she in possession of all her husband's
propertya handsome farm on the other
side of the mountain. Emily, I had
wicked thoughts then. I believed my
family were led away by a deceiver, and
an antichrist. I listened eagerly to the
stories of those that reviled our mother's
name. Some said that she and her elders
were the offscourings of the English jails;
others seeing that her work far
transcended
natural power, accused her of
witchcraft; some insisted that she was a
man in woman's apparel; and although
she predicted the independence of this
favoured land, and could not act against
her own testimony, there were some who
charged her with treasonable practices,
and threw her into jail. I was willing
to believe all that the voice of the
slanderer
uttered; and when my father came
to take me to her, in obedience to him I
went, but blinded by my prepossessions.
It was then that mother and William Lee
and our ancients were gathering the
believers
at Niskeyuna, and there your
grandfather carried me.
We arrived at the close of a
November
day; the sun had just set in clouds
the sky was dark and foreboding. I
had been chilled and wearied with our
long ride and fasting; but when we
turned from the high road into a woody
path, and my father pointing to a smoke
that curled upward from a deep wood,
said, there dwells the bright star, I
forgot all the weakness and the wants of
the flesh. The adversary put forth all
his strength to secure his dominion in
my weak and troubled mind;a
trembling
seized meit seemed to me that I
was hurried on to a precipice, and I had
no power to resist the cruel force that
pressed me onward. I tried to pray, but
my spirit died away within me. The
low murmurs of the little stream along
which we rodethe wind that sighed
through the naked branches of the trees
the rustling of the fallen leaves over
which we passed, all seemed to speak a
voice of warning to my fearful spirit.
I was always a feeling and a
thoughtful
girl, Emily, and it had long been
borne in upon my mind that great things
awaited me: still I hated the way that
was opened, and joyfully would I have
turned my back upon the light that was
ready to dawn on me.
As we approached the house the
believers were closing the afternoon
worship; I caught the sound of the
evening
hymn: it was so ordered, that I did
not then, nor till long after, witness the
going forth in the dance. My faith was
not yet strong enough for it, and for a
long time, the Lord forgive me! it was
a cross to me.
When we were about to enter the
door, my father perceived that my limbs
were sinking under me, and he led, or
rather dragged me into the room. Oh
Emily, I shall never forget that moment.
The apartment, though in a
loghouse
,
was a large one, the brethren
having in their early gathering removed
all the partitions to give space for the
labour worship. There was a bright fire
on the hearth from some pine knots, but
no other light in the room. The brethren,
with their broad-brimmed hats slouched,
and casting a deep shadow over their
faces, were sitting on one side of the
room, as is their customthe sisters on
the other; their arms were folded, and
their eyes all cast down; and exhausted
by the evening labour they were pale as
spectres. Our mother stood in the
centre
of the apartment aloneher arms also
folded across her breast. I looked
fearfully
aroundI saw my natural brothers
and sisters, as the flame burned brightly
and shone upon their faces, but none of
them regarded me. It seemed to me
that I had come into an assembly of the
dead. I turned to beg my father to lead
me away, but he had quitted my side,
and taken his place among the brethren.
My head grew giddy, and I thought
myself sinking to the earth.
At this moment our mother advanced
to me; `and is this,' she said, `the one
stray lamb that I have so longed to get
into the fold?' My bonnet had fallen
backshe laid her hand upon my head
her hand and arm were bare, and
white and smooth as if they had been
rounded out of the purest marble. My
hair was dressed after the fashion of the
world. `You must forsake these
vanities
,
Susan,' said she:she did not speak
sharply, though she could sometimes
sharply rebuke sin:she made a short
pause, and then fixing her clear piercing
blue eye steadfastly on me, as if she
penetrated to the depths of my soul, she
added, in a low solemn tone, `Susan, I
bear a message to youthe Master saith,
`forsake all and follow me, and ye shall
have in this world an hundred fold, and
in the world to come, life everlasting.'
Emily, there was a celestial melody
in mother's voice in the gift of speaking,
and a weight in all her words, and
though I gave no outward sign, they
sunk deeply into my heart. She said no
more to me at that timeshe was never
forward to speak. In her looks there
was a boldness and an innocence that
seemed, as it were, like the truth and the
gentleness of the gospel she preached,
written for a testimony in every line of
her face.
Ah! she had, continued the
enthusiast
,
her eyes kindling and her face
brightening, while her imagination
magnified
the graces of the leader who had
captivated her youthful affection. Ah,
she had all the sweet qualities of woman,
and yet Emily, for a season I turned my
back on her. I returned to my natural
motherto the worldtoyes it is
fitting
you should know all my temptations
to one to whom I was deeply bound
in my affections.
Susan pausedand Emily's sobbing,
which had continued at intervals till this
moment, ceased. She raised her face,
now gleaming with faint streaks of red,
from Susan's bosom, and fixing her eye
on the speaker, who after some effort
continued,
William Harwood was a pleasant
VOL. II. I
lad: we had been mates from our
infancy
,
and had loved one another (loving
no one else) with that faith which is the
boast of the world's people: little did I
think till the gospel was opened to me,
that that love was the fruit of a depraved
naturethat, if I would not perish
eternally
,
it must be plucked off and cast
from me. William pleaded for it, and
my own heart pleaded more stoutly
Oh, Emily! you know not how the
natural man can talkand oh, my
innocent
child, be thankful; you know not
how the unregenerate heart goes forth
in what the world calls love; how the
breath of the body and the life of the
soul seem bound up in the life and
breath of another; how cheap the
sacrifice
of earthyea heaven, to the idol
seems
Oh, stop, stop, exclaimed Emily,
falling on her knees, and clasping her
hands in agony, do not say any more
to me, I cannot bear it.
Nay, my child, replied Susan,
recovering
her calm tone and self-command
which had for a moment given way
before
the rush of natural feeling. Nay,
be quiet and listen, for grace obtained
the victory. The conflict lasted for
many months. I saw that I could in no
way be justified but by obeying the
gospel
and setting out with the believers.
Your grandmother hated the faith then
as she does now. I could answer all she
said, but when William told me with
despairing looks that he should be a
ruined man if I forsook him, my heart
sunk within me. My flesh consumed
on my bones as if there had been a curse
upon me, and often, often between the
setting and the rising of the sun my
eyelids have not met, and in the
morning
I could wring from my handkerchief
the tears that had poured from my eyes
like rain in the night. But finally grace
triumphed over nature: the strong man
was bound, and I joined myself to the
I 2
people. It is now thirty years since I
believed, and, added she, raising her
hands and eyes, and speaking with more
energy than she had yet spoken, I say
the truth before God, and lie not: I
have not repented for a moment; I have
been heartily thankful that I have borne
my testimonyI have purchased a peace
that cannot be taken away, and cheaply
purchased it.
Then I am lost, exclaimed Emily.
Nay, do not mistake me, childI
mean that having put my hand to the
plough, I never turned back; but I had
many heavy dragging hours, much
hungering
after forsaken joys. It could not
be otherwise, but again I say I never
repented. You know already that when
tribulation came, many fell away. Our
mother was carried to prison. My
father, your father, all my natural
kindred
left herI alone remained to abide
our day of wasteness and desolation.
And did you ever again see William
Harwood? inquired Emily.
Yea, yea, child, that was my chiefest
sorrow; he never gave me uphe would
not believe that I would persevere in a
celibious life and after our family
removed
hither he came every month and
sometimes every week to see me. He
once came into our worshipping
assembly
,
but the moment that I went forth
in the dance, he fainted and fell to the
floor. After that I saw him but seldom.
Susan paused, and Emily asked, if
he never married?
Nay, replied Susan.
And is he dead? inquired Emily.
Wait a moment, child, and ye shall
hear it allyea all. She pressed her
hands on her foreheadMy head is
giddy, and these thoughts have kindled
strange fire in my heart. She remained
silent for a few moments, and then,
resuming her usual deliberate manner,
she said, William was an only, and
an indulged child. His parents had
never crossed him in any thing; and
though he had a kind and a tender
disposition
,
he could not brook a
disappointment
.
He fell into a weakly way, and
then he took to ruinous habits. His poor
old parents died, I fear, of a wounded
spirit; for they laid his misfortunes sadly
to heart. After their death his worldly
affairs went fast to destruction, and he
became a miserable vagrant. He would
come here and sit for hours on the
doorstep
;
at these times I kept to my room,
for I could do nothing for him; and if
he chanced to see me in his fits of
intoxication
,
he would either upbraid me
bitterly
,
or cry like a childand both were
trying to me.
It is ten years ago the tenth day of
last January; it had stormed for three
days, and the roads were blocked with
the drifted snows; and it had been a
cruel cold night; and in the morning
a Sabbath morning toowhen we had
risen and kindled a fire, one of the
brethren
opened the outer door, and there
was lying a poor wretch across the
doorstone
frozen
to death; we all gathered
round him; and O Emily, child, it
was
William?
Yeayeait was William himself.
Oh misery! misery! exclaimed
Emily, with a burst of sympathy which
she could not repress.
Yea, it was misery. I forgot myself
forgot all that stood about me. I saw
not his tattered dirty garments, nor his
bloated face, but I saw him as in the
days of our youth and our love, and I
fell on his neck and weptI could not
help it; but thanks be rendered, she
added, raising her eyes, it was the last
struggle of nature, and it has been
forgiven
.
And have you suffered thus? asked
Emily, after a moment's pause.
Do not so speak, child, replied
Susan; rather be grateful that I have
been accounted worthy thus to suffer.
Susan's raised feelings did not permit
her to add any thing farther. She
became silent and abstracted; and
Emily, exhausted with her emotions,
laid her head in her elder sister's lap,
and like a child wept herself to sleep.
Susan's narrative had not precisely the
effect on the mind of her disciple that
she had designed and anticipated.
Emily's excited imagination was deeply
impressed by Harwood's death, and the
instinctive conclusion of her feelings
was perhaps as just as if it had been a
logical deduction from a process of
reasoning
.
She felt that the faith which
exacted such sacrifices, and produced
such effects, was stern in its requisitions,
and cruel in its consequences. Her
fidelity to this strange religion hung, as
it were, by a hairits vibration at the
mercy of every passing influence,
unlike
Susan, whose strong feelings being
set one way by some powerful impetus,
were as little liable as a tide of the
ocean, to fluctuate from human
interposition
.

CHAPTER XV.
Le bonheur se compose d'une suite d'actions et de sensations

voil en gnral ce qui le forme et le constitue.
Madame de Genlis

The
Shaker Society at Hancock in
Massachusetts, is one of the eldest
establishments of this sect, which has
extended its limits far beyond the
anticipations
of the unbelieving world,
and now boasts that its outposts have
advanced to the frontiers of civilization
to Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, and
exults in the verification of the prophecy,
a little one shall become a thousand,
and a small one a strong nation.
The society is distributed into several
families of a convenient size
[3]
[3]
No family, we believe, is permitted to exceed a
hundred members. Hear and admire, ye
housekeepers
.
for
domestic
arrangements, and the whole
body is guided and governed by elder
brothers and elder sisters, whose
gifts of superior wisdom, knowledge,
or cunning, obtain for them these titles,
and secure to them their rights and
immunities
.
There are gradations of rank,
or, as they choose to designate their
distinctions
,
of privilege among them;
but none are exempt from the equitable
law of their religious republic, which
requires each individual to labour
with his hands, according to his
strength.
A village is divided into lots of
various
dimensions. Each enclosure
contains
a family, whose members are
clothed from one store-house, fed at the
same board, and perform their domestic
worship together. In the centre of the
enclosure is a large building, which
contains
their eating-room and kitchen,
their sleeping apartments, and two large
rooms connected by folding doors,
where they receive their visitors, and
assemble for their evening religious
service
.
All their mechanical and manual
labours, distinct from the housewifery,
(a profane term in this application) are
performed in offices at a convenient
distance
from the main dwelling, and
within the enclosure. In these offices
may be heard, from the rising to the
setting of the sun, the cheerful sounds
of voluntary industrysounds as
significant
to the moral sense, as the smith's
stroke upon his anvil to the musical ear.
One edifice is erected over a cold
perennial
stream, and devoted to the various
operations of the dairy; from another
proceed the sounds of the heavy looms
and the flying shuttle, and the buzz of the
swift wheels; in one apartment is a
group of sisters, selected chiefly from
the old and feeble, but among whom
were also some of the young and
tasteful
,
weaving the delicate basket;
another
is devoted to the dress-makers, (a
class that obtains even among shaking
Quakers,) who are employed in
fashioning
,
after a uniform model, the striped
cotton for summer wear, or the
sadcoloured
winter russet; here is the
patient
teacher, and there the ingenious
manufacturer; and wherever labour is
performed, there are many valuable
contrivances
by which toil is lightened and
success insured.
The villages of Lebanon

The village at Lebanon is distinguished as the

and
Hancock
have been visited by foreigners and
strangers from all parts of our union
all are shocked or disgusted by some of
the absurdities of the shaker faith, but
none have withheld their admiration
from the results of their industry,
ingenuity
,
order, frugality, and temperance.
The perfection of these virtues among
them may perhaps be traced with
propriety
to the founder of their sect, who
united practical wisdom with the wildest
fanaticism, and who proved that she
understood
the intricate machine of the
human mind, when she declared that
temporal prosperity was the indication,
and should be the reward of spiritual
fidelity.
The prosperity of the society's
agriculture
is a beautiful illustration of the
philosophical remark, that to
temperance
every day is bright, and every hour
propitious to diligence. Their skilful
cultivation preserves them from many of
the disasters that fall like a curse upon
the slovenly husbandry of the farmers
in their vicinity. Their gardens always
flourish in spite of late frosts and early
frostsblast and mildew ravage their
neighbours' fields without invading their
territorythe mischievous daisy, that
spreads its starry mantle over the rich
meadows of the `world's people,' does
not presume to lift its yellow head in
their green fieldsand even the Canada
thistle, that bristled little warrior armed
at all points, that comes in from the
north, extirpating in its march, like the
hordes of barbarous invaders, all the fair
fruits of civilization, is not permitted to
intrude upon their grounds.
It is sufficiently manifest that this
felicity is the natural consequence and
appropriate reward of their skill,
vigilance
,
and unwearied toil, but they
believe it (or affect to believe it) to be a
spiritual blessingan assurance of
peculiar
favour, like that which exempted the
Israelites from the seven Egyptian plagues
an accomplishment of the promise that
every one that hath forsaken houses,
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
mother, or
wife
, or children, or lands for
my name's sake, shall
receive an hundred
fold
.
The sisters too have their peculiar and
appropriate blessings and exemptions.
They are saved from those scourges of
our land of liberty and equality, poor
help and no help. There are no
scolding mistresses, nor eye-servants
among them.
It might be curious to ascertain by
what magical process these felicitous
sisters have expelled from their thrifty
housewifery that busy mischievous
principle
of all evil in the domestic economy
of the `world's people,' known in all its
proteus shapes by the name of `bad
luck;' the modern successor of Robin
Goodfellow, with all the spite, but
without
the genius of that frolic-loving little
spirit, he who
Frights the maidens of the villagery,
Skims milk, and sometimes labours in the quern,
And bootless makes the breathless housewife churn,
And sometimes makes the drink to bear no barm.
How much broken china, spoiled
batches of bread, ruined tempers, and
other common domestic disasters might
be avoided by the discovery of this secret;
what tribes of mice, ants, flies, and other
household demons, might be driven from
their strong holds. We hope that none
of those provoking solvers of mysteries,
who are so fond of finding out the `
reason
of the thing,' that they are daily
circumscribing within most barren and
inconvenient limits the dominion of the
imagination, will pretend to have found
the clue to this mystery in the exact
order and elaborate neatness of the
sisterhood.
The sisters themselves certainly hint
at a sublime cause of their success, when
in reply to a stranger's involuntary
admiration
of their stainless walls, polished
floors, snow white linen, and all the
detail
of their precise arrangement and
ornamental neatness, they say with the
utmost gravity, `God is the God of
order and not of confusion.'
The most signal triumph of the society,
is in the discipline of the children.
Of these there are many among them:
a few are received, together with their
`believing' parents; in some instances
orphans, and even orphan families are
adopted; and many are brought to the
society by parents, who, either from the
despair of poverty, or the carelessness of
vice, choose to commit their offspring to
the guardianship of the shakers. Now
that the first fervours of enthusiasm are
abated, and conversions have become
rare, the adoption of children is a
principle
cause of the continuance and
preservation
of the society. These little
born rebels, natural enemies to the social
compact, lose, in their hands, their
prescriptive
right to uproar and misrule,
and soon become as silent, as formal,
and as neat as their elders.
We hope we shall not be suspected of
speaking the language of panegyric
rather than justice, if we add that the
hospitalities of these people are never
refused to the weary way-worn-traveller,
nor their alms to the needy; and that
their faith (however absurd and
indefensible
its peculiarities) is tempered by
some generous and enlightened
principles
which those who had rather learn
than scoff would do well to adopt. In
short, those who know them well, and
judge them equitably, will not withhold
from them the praise of moral conduct
which they claim, in professing
themselves
as a community, a harmless, just,
and upright people.
It is time that we should return from
our long digression to give some account
of the spiritual and physical labours of
Reuben Harrington. At nine o'clock
in the evening that followed the day of
the brethren's sage council, the bell,
according to the uniform custom,
sounded
for the evening worship. The
brethren
and sisters poured in equal streams
into the two large apartments, which
were now thrown into one by the
opening
of the wide folding doors. A few
candles were hung around the walls,
casting a dim and quivering light upon
the strange throng. The men took their
stations in one apartment, the women in
the other, and arranged themselves
opposite
to each other in straight lines,
extending
across the room. The eldest
were placed in the front ranksby this
arrangement, the young people were
saved from the temptation to wandering
looks, and their consequence, wandering
thoughtsnot uncommon in the most
orthodox congregations.
After a few moments, the deep and
reverential silence of the assembly was
broken by a shout, in which every voice
was simultaneously lifted to its highest
pitch. The shout was followed by a
hymn, but sung so loud, with such
discordant
and irregular sounds (for music
it could not be called), that it was
impossible
to distinguish any words, excepting
our mother and mother Anne,
which seemed to form a kind of chorus.
The singing was accompanied by an
equal and steady motion, and alternating
from one foot to the other, which
resembles
to a profane eye the
pas bas
of the
world's dancers. This deafening yell
and uniform motion continued till their
breath was spent, when all the assembly,
as if governed by one instinct, relapsed
into silence.
They remained as motionless as so
many statues, till the profound stillness
was broken by Harrington Brethren
and sisters, he said, we labour this
evening for a special gift, and to
encourage
our hearts, and enliven our faith, it
is meet that we should bear upon our
minds all those holy men and women of
old, who, according to their light, have
worshipped in the dance. Sisters,
bethink
yourselves of Miriam; of Miriam,
the sister of Aaron, a prophetessthe
first in the female linewho when she
sang the glorious triumph of the Lord
over the Egyptian host, `took a timbrel
in her hand, and all the women went out
after her with timbrels and with
dances
'
remember the daughters of Shiloh,
who went `yearly to the feast of the
Lord to
dance
in
dances
and king
David
,
who leaped and
danced
before the
Lord, so that Michal, profane Michal,
despised him in her heart, even as the
world's people in these latter times
despise us, and deride our
labour-worship
.
Ye believers need not be told that
the Psalmist justifies his deeds by his
words, and exhorts the faithful again
and again `to praise the Lord with the
timbrel and the
dance
'to praise His
name in the
dance
.' Solomon tells us,
`there is a time to
dance
,' and manifestly
he could not mean there was a time for
those vain festive rites wherewith the
carnal children of this world worship
their god. Hath not the holy prophet
Jeremiah predicted our day in these
memorable words, `then shall the Virgin
rejoice in the
dance
, both young men
and old together? When was this
prediction verified in the ball-rooms of
the world's people? There the young
man goes not forth with the aged
brother
,
but selects the fair and youthful
maiden for his partner in the dance;
and nothing can be more unlike our
spiritual labours, than the movements of
their bodies, and the exercises of their
minds! Again the same prophet saith,
`O, Virgin of Israel, thou shalt again be
adorned with thy tabrets, and go forth
in the
dances
.'
Here Reuben paused, either to take
breath, or because he had exhausted his
authorities; and the assembly, without
any visible external direction, but
apparently
in obedience to a common
impulse
,
broke up their ranks,arranged
in pairs, the elder taking precedence of
the younger, and the sisters of the
brethren
,
they made in a dancing
procession
the circuit of the two apartments.
A small knot of brethren and sisters
remained in the centre of each room,
shouting strange music to the dancers,
and slowly turning so as to keep their
faces always towards the procession,
which moved on with a uniform shuffling
step, as if it was composed of so many
automatons, their arms rising and falling
mechanically; and their monotonous
movements, solemn, melancholy, or
stupid
aspects, contrasting ludicrously with
the festive throngs which are usually
seen stepping on `light fantastic toe,'
through the mazy dance.
There was but one in all this assembly
that seemed to be governed by natural
feeling; this was Emily, who, in
obedience
to the stern requisition of her
aunt had come, or rather been dragged
into the room; but unable to perform
her part of the insane worship, unable
in truth to support her own weight, she
had sunk on her knees in a recess of the
window near which she was standing;
her cap had fallen from her head, and
laid beside herher fair hair, thus
permitted
to escape from its bondage, had
fallen over her neck and shoulders, she
had covered her face with her hands,
and disordered, pale, and trembling,
there she remained, till the assembly
forming into the procession, exposed her
to every eye, looking like a culprit
awaiting her sentence.
Susan had missed her from her side,
and had hoped that she had stolen away
to her own apartment, and that her
disappearance
would remain unobserved.
Vain were the elder sister's efforts to
command peace in her own troubled
mind, when she beheld the humiliating
and sorrowful spectacle. The burning
colour that flushed her usually sallow
cheek, and her unsteady movements,
betrayed her affliction. She would have
given the world to have sheltered her
fallen favourite from the disgrace of such
VOL. II. K
an exposure, but to move from the ranks
was impossible. The elders and the
disciplined
passed Emily in their rounds
without any other notice than a languid
and brief glance; but the younger, and
especially the children, unable to
control
their curiosity, gazed on her till
their heads were at right angles with
their bodies. Suddenly the procession
stopped; and Harrington advancing
from the ranks, `laboured alone with
great power,' and whirling around like a
top, to which his form bore no faint
resemblance
,
he continued his violent
exercise for an hour; then approaching
Emily, and laying his hand upon her
headTo me, brethren and sisters,
he said, is assigned the task and given
the gift to snatch this prey from Satan.
The work is to be wrought out in private
conference, when words of rebuke, of
wisdom, and of conviction will flow from
my lips, as the water flowed from the
rock at the touch of Moses.Fear not,
young maidentremble notbe not thus
disheartenedthe devil shall release you
from his toils, and you shall yet shine
out a bright star among the faithful.
The assembly acquiesced silently in
the result of Reuben's extraordinary
worship. They dispersed to their
several
apartments; and Susan, without one
word of inquiry or reprimand, led Emily
to her own room, and spent the silent
watches of the night in weeping and
praying for her.
On the following day Harrington
began
,
and continued for many successive
days, his private conferences with Emily.
For some time he confined himself to
harangues on the peculiar doctrines of
his sect. Emily listened dutifully, but
the more she listened, the more her
growing aversion to them strengthened.
He insisted that the net in which Satan
had caught her could not be broken,
unless she would be governed by his
wisdomguided by his inward light.
K 2
Emily sighed and wept, but never
attempted
a reply.
After awhile he changed his tone;
he occasionally softened his rebukes with
praise, sometimes mingled flattery with
his admonitions, and darkly intimated a
purpose that he dared not yet fully
disclose
.Still
Emily listened patiently:
she had been always remarkable for
singleness
of heart, a soft temper, and
tender affections, but never for a quick
or keen perception. Her mind too had
been recently weakened by the hard
conflict between her natural affections
and her mistaken sense of duty: it was
not wonderful, therefore, that she did
not distrust Harrington's integrity, nor
suspect the meaning that glimmered
through his mystical language.
He continued gradually preparing her
mind for the proposition he had in
reserve
for her, nothing doubting of its
final acceptance; for Reuben, in
common
with all thorough hypocrites, was
quite incredulous as to the existence of
goodness, and believed that the
seemingly
upright only wanted the
opportunity
and the motive to turn aside from
the straight and narrow way. At last
impatient at his own slow and serpentine
advances to Emily's understanding, and
afraid that in spite of her habitual
passiveness
her patience would be exhausted
before he had approached the attainment
of his purpose, and hoping too, against
hope, that her uniform silence foreboded
his final successhe took a bold
straightforward
step. At his accustomed hour
he entered the room where Emily was
sitting with the elder sister. He
detained
Susan for a moment to enquire
`if she yet perceived any smoking of the
flax any symptom of revival in the
child?' She shook her head mournfully,
and slowly withdrew, leaving him alone
with Emily with evident reluctance.
He then drew his chair close to the
poor girl, and taking her hand, (a
freedom
he had never before ventured upon)
and not rebuked by the innocent look of
surprise and inquiry which she turned
on him, he proceeded to say, in the
softest voice he could assume, You
are a worthy maiden, Emilya chosen
vessela vessel selected for a great
ministry
;
if you have been cast into the
furnace, it is that you may come out as
gold seven times tried; the honoured
instrument must be made bright and
keen in the fires of tribulation. Awake,
maiden, awake, and survey the path that
I am appointed to open to your view
the path we must travel together; for
we are not permitted longer to remain
here, mere watchmen on the walls of
Zion, but are commanded to march
boldly forward to the enemy's camp.
Listen, while I disclose to you the
revelation that has been vouchsafed to
me. I have obtained a great advance
upon the forward wheel; it has been
made plain to me that we are together to
accomplish a great workto turn and
overturn, till we bring to pass the
conversion
of the world.
A faint light dawned on Emily's mind,
and fearfulness mingled with the
amazement
with which she had hitherto gazed
on Harrington. He perceived that she
was startled, but he went on undaunted.
The Israelites were commanded to
spoil the Egyptians, and we are
permitted
,
nay, ordered, to take of the lucre
(which belongeth equally to our
brethren
and to us) in order to help us
forward
in our blessed mission, and to
reward
our labours. A goodly sum in the
bank at Albany awaiteth us. All these
matters it is duty for a season to hide
from our brethren and sisters; they
cannot
yet receive them. Our departure
must be secretat nightyea, this
night.
Astonished, alarmed, and still
uncertain
,
Emily did not utter a word: her
eyes were fixed on Reuben, and looked
as though they would have started from
their sockets.
Nay, precious maiden, he
continued
,
misinterpreting her silence, do
not tremble thusye need not be
alarmed. We have a farther
dispensation
:
as we go among the world's
people
,
we are permitted to be united in
wedlock by one of the world's priests.
Till this moment Reuben's meaning had
but partially appeared to Emily through
the fog of cant phrases in which he had
artfully involved it; but his last words,
and the fond look that accompanied
them, were like the touch of Ithuriel
her persecutor stood revealed in his true
light. She snatched her hand from him,
and groaning aloud she sprang towards
the doorthe door opened, and Susan
entered.
Oh for mercy's sake save me, take
me away! cried the poor girl, clinging
to her aunt in desperation.
What means this? inquired Susan,
looking at Harrington; have you dared
to insult the innocent girl?Be calm,
Emily, my child, be calm.',
Smooth your brow, sister, replied
Harrington, with perfect coolness, and
I will tell all that has passed between
us.
Say on, she answered, without in
the least relaxing her features, and
bear it in mind that I shall know from
this afflicted girl, who never opened her
mouth to speak a lie, whether ye speak
truly.
My word, replied Reuben, will go
farthermuch farther with the people
than that poor fargone sinner's.
That may be, Reuben, but not with
me, therefore speak quickly and truly.
There is a moral power in virtuous
resolution that the most vicious find it
difficult to resist. Reuben perceived
that he could neither conceal nor deny,
and that his best, indeed his only policy
was to state the truth, and to varnish it
K 3
over with the best gloss his ready wit
could invent. He said that all his
attempts
to reclaim Emily had hitherto
been fruitless; that as elder sister knew,
he had laboured in season, and out of
season, and all in vainall without
producing
a sign of life in the child.
That morning, he said, it had
been sent in upon his mind to try her
with a temptation, in order to ascertain
how far she was under the dominion of
Satan; or at least to drive away the
dumb devil that possessed her,in that
he had succeeded. He then went on
to detail what he had said to Emily
verbatim
,
omitting nothing but his design
on the funds of the society: a
circumstance
that he rightly judged his last
monstrous proposition had effaced from
Emily's mind. And now, sister, he
said, in conclusion, I think your
conscience
will tell you that you have judged
me with unrighteous judgment; that
nature has so far gotten the upper hand
of grace with you, that you are blinded,
sorely blinded; and henceforth you will
feel it to be duty to leave the girl to my
appointed ministry.
Never, never, replied Susan, firmly:
she has been unkindly dealt with
alreadynature and grace both speak for
the child, Reubenboth tell me that she
needs `more gentle usage.'
But, woman, I have the gift.
I have a gift also, Reuben; and
sooner shall you have my heart's blood,
than I will trust this girl with you again;
ye need not lift your voice in the
congregation
;
ye need not whisper among the
brethren. Remember I am your elder;
I fear you not, Reuben; I suspect you.
The determined look with which Susan
accompanied her words, quelled
Harrington's
spirit: he dared not attempt a
reply
,
and smothering an imprecation, he
departed to digest, as he best could, his
rage and mortification.
Susan did not think it expedient to
make any farther direct disclosure to
Emily of her suspicions of Harrington,
but she cautiously questioned and
cross-questioned
her. Emily, confounded by
Reuben's subtlety, and feeble and
exhausted
,
could not remember that he had
said to her any more or other, than he
had repeated to the elder sister.
Notwithstanding the agreement of the
simple girl's testimony with Reuben's
story, Susan was too sagacious to be
deceived
by the interpretation the crafty
brother had put upon the language he
had held to her, and having for a long
time felt a growing dislike and distrust
of him, she was not convinced that she
had been mistaken in her conclusions;
and she remained quite satisfied that she
had done right in refusing him any
farther
communication with Emily.
Emily's melancholy became every day
deeper and more fixed, and Susan began
to fear the total annihilation of her mind.
She imposed no restraint on her, but
permitted
her to walk when she chose; to
remain secluded from observation in her
own room, and sometimes to lie all day
on the bed in a state of listlessness and
vacuity, in which she appeared scarcely
conscious of her existence.
CHAPTER XVI.
Curse on his perjured arts! dissembling, smooth!
Are honour, virtue, conscience, all exil'd?
Is there no pity, no relenting ruth?
Burns
.
Emily
was one day sitting by her
window
,
when she saw a party of travellers
from Lebanon springs stop at their gate.
It suddenly occurred to her that she
might, through the agency of some one
of the party, get a letter conveyed to her
friends. The thought that this might be
the first step towards leaving the society,
flitted across her mind, but without
forming any distinct purpose, she hastily
penned the letter, which was the
occasion
of Ellen's abrupt departure from
Eton. She then stationed herself at a
door that opened into one of the passages
through which the visitors were to pass;
and arresting the attention of a romantic
young lady who was in the rear of the
throng, she slipped the letter into her
hand, unobserved by any one, and
entreating
her to convey it safely to some
post-office, she disappeared, leaving her
confidant quite elated with the trust
which had been confided to her by the
pale interesting little shaker, and which
she discharged, as has been seen, with
laudable fidelity.
Activity is as necessary to the health
of the mind, as exercise to that of the
body. Emily derived more benefit from
the effort she had made in writing and
despatching her letter than she had felt
from the combined skill, moral and
medical
,
of the whole fraternity. For a few
days her heart was cheered, and her
countenance brightened. She had no
settled purpose of leaving the society:
she still believed it her duty to remain
with them, and the tender sympathy and
forbearance of her aunt had strengthened
the almost filial love she bore herthe only
sentiment that alleviated the misery of her
condition. Still her belief of
Harrington's
hypocrisy, countenanced and
confirmed
as it was by Susan, had shaken
her faith in the monstrous pretensions of
the believers: she fancied she saw deceit
lurking under many a broad brim, and
she felt a secret revulsion from the
dancing
worship, which she had never joined
in, or even witnessed since the
memorable
night of Harrington's inspiration.
A few days after the despatch of the
letter, and just at twilightthat sweet
hour consecrated by all young ladies in
their teens to sentiment and romantic
meditationsEmily, availing herself of
the liberty she had recently enjoyed,
strolled out, without any other purpose
than to be alone, and think her own
thoughts. She had not walked far when
she perceived Reuben approaching her.
He did not appear to have observed her,
and to escape his notice she turned into
a little enclosure she had just then
reached
,
which a few broken stones marked as
a place of interment. She paused a
moment
at the graves, and almost envied
their silent tenants.
The shakers preserve all their austere
formality in the disposition of their dead:
the brethren and sisters are laid in
separate
and parallel lines, as if they
contemplated
the same restrictions in the other
world which they impose here: each
grave is designated by a rough hewn
stone inscribed (with ostentatious
humility
)
with the initials only of the name
borne by the person who reposes beneath
it. Emily's thoughts naturally reverted
to the village church-yard where her
father and her mother slept. That
seemed
a social place when compared with
the shaker burial ground. Her
imagination
pictured the storied monuments
the sacred spot where her parents laid
the beautiful willow that drooped over
it, and the neatly carved white stone
that stood under its shadow, setting
forth in its long inscription their virtues
and their sufferings. Oh, that I was
there, was the involuntary breathing of
her spirit.
After lingering for a few moments lost
in melancholy contemplations, she turned
away and pursued her walk through a
secluded path to the garden which lay
at a short distance from her. As she
entered it she passed an old man
arranging
a bed of violets, which with many
other beautiful flowers obtain sufferance
among these ascetics on account of some
real or fancied medical virtue.
I am glad to see ye, child, said the
good-natured old man. I think ye are
picking up a little, and I am heartily
glad to see it: I would not have you a
drooping lily all your days. It is a short
pilgrimage through this world, and a
thorny path it may be, but seeing it
leads to the garden of Paradise, it is not
worth while for a reasonable person to
worry with the troubles by the way; they
can't last longthat is a comfort,
continued
the speaker, striking his spade
into the earth and resting upon it. I
have seen mothers wailing for their
firstborn
as if their very souls died with
them, and in a few days, or a few years
at worst, that passed away like a vapour,
they too were cut down and lying quiet
beside them. I have seen children
withering away like a severed branch at
the death of their parents, and a frost
has come and nipt them in their flower.
I have seen people wearying themselves
for riches and honours, and just when
they had got them, leave them all for the
shroud and the cold earth. I tell you,
my young sister, life is a short journey,
therefore don't be discouraged if the
road is not quite to your liking.
Emily made no reply to this kind
exhortation
,
but she plucked some of the
violets and asked the old man, if they
were not sometimes called heart's
ease?
Yea, I believe some folks call them
heart's ease.
And do they grow no where but on
the believer's ground? she asked.
Yea, yea, replied the man, smiling
significantly, as if he understood the
import of her inquiry; they grow all
about among the neighbours  every
where.
He paused and looked at Emily for a
moment, and then casting his eyes in
every direction, and ascertaining there
was no one in hearing, he lowered his
voice and said, I believe you to be a
discreet, good little body, and that
you'll keep the counsel I give you to
yourself. You are wearied with this
kind of strange, still life, childyour
mind is running upon your relations,
your homemay be upon some
sweetheart
now
ye need not look so
frightened
,
it is nat'ral, it is nat'ralI don't
blame you for it. I always feel sorry to
see a young and tender plant put into
soil it don't love; it never takes root
fairlynever thrives. Now, my advice
is that you pluck up courage, tell the
people the plain truth, go home to your
friends, get a good husband, and `guide
the house.' Ye can take scripture
warrant
with you, for its God's own word,
that `in
every nation
, he that feareth
him and worketh righteousness is
accepted
of him.'
Emily with very natural surprise gazed
at the old man as if she discredited her
senses. Are you a shaker? she
asked.
A shaker, girl! he replied,
laughing
yea,
and a very good shaker.
His muscles contracted as he added, I
have been what is called an unfortunate
man in the world. Every thing went
against me. I lost my wife, my
children
lost
my propertyand I thought
I could not do better than to get a
shelter
in this peaceable place; and as I had
a remarkable gift for gardening, the
people were glad to have me with
them.
Then you are not a shaker? said
Emily, bewildered by the contrariety of
his motives with those she had always
heard professed by the shakers.
Yea, but I am, that is to say, in the
main a believer. Our people are foolish
about some things, but then I never saw
any religion but there were some weeds
among it; and to speak truly, I am too
near the end of my summer to care much
where my leaves drop; but it is a pity
you should be growing, nay, growing
you are not, but withering in the shade:
say nothing, but store my counsel in
your heart, and let it bring forth its fruit
in season: thus concluding, the
kindhearted
old gardener turned away and
left Emily to reflect on his singular
communication
.
Though not a very skilful reasoner,
she came to the just conclusion, that
such shakers as the crafty Harrington
and the frank gardener, were not shakers
by divine impulse; that the ties which
attached others to the society were not
in all cases indissoluble, and the society
itself did not exist by prescriptive divine
right.
She sought a sequestered part of the
garden, and seating herself in the shade
of some fruit-trees, and as she thought
secure from observation, she drew from
her bosom the precious little scroll which
linked her to the world. All that was
there written was more legibly inscribed
on her heart, but still she loved to look
on it. The sight of it touched her
imagination
like a conjurer's wand, and
brought before her all those images she
most loved to dwell upon. She resigned
herself to the visions of her fancy, forgot
the formal habitations around her, the
severe brethren and the pale sisters; and
was restored to the Lenox family,
joining
in their bustling occupations, sharing
their pleasures, the object of the
kindness
of all, and the chosen, loved partner
of James. She beheld her old
grandmother
cheerful and approving, Ellen
Bruce smiling on her with sisterly
kindness
,
the merry faces of the children;
she heard their unrebuked mirth,
Debby's
loud laugh; she saw and she heard
all, till awakened from her reverie by an
approaching footstep, she looked up and
beheld Harrington coming towards her.
She instinctively started on her feet, and
intending to restore the scroll to its
hiding place, she unconsciously dropped
it. As she walked hastily past
Harrington
homeward, he said, Stop, Emily
stop, my good girlI have something
particular to say to you.
I cannot hear it now, she replied,
redoubling her speed.
You cannot! muttered Reuben,
looking after her: the time will come
when you shall hear meand hear me
patiently and quietly.
Provoked at being defeated in his
purpose
of speaking to her, he remained
where she left him, whetting his
resentment
and brooding vengeance, when the
note she had dropped caught his eye.
He took it up, and read it. Ah now,
thought he, I see the reasons why my
fair offers were received with horror and
disdain  the little fool has a younger
sweetheart but she shall find the old
fox an overmatch for the young hound.
Never did a vulture fasten his talons
around his victim with more exultation
than Harrington thrust poor little Emily's
lost talisman into his pockethe did not
see exactly how he should turn it to
account; but it gave him power, and
power in his hands was the sure means
of mischief. It would not be very
edifying
to thread all the intricate windings
of his bad mindto examine the projects
he conceived and dismissed, till he
devised
VOL. II. L
one which flattered him with the
hope of the certain destruction of his
innocent victim, and with the prospect
of complete vengeance on the elder
sister
,
who he well knew was vulnerable
alone through this object of her natural
affection.
Subtle and active, it was not long
before
his plans were matured. Two days
after he had obtained possession of the
note for which Emily had anxiously and
vainly sought, he came on some pretext
of business into an apartment where she
and one of the sisters were sitting. Emily
felt as strong an impulse to leave the
room as if a venomous reptile had crept
into it, but afraid of attracting the
notice
of a third person, she remained with
as much tranquillity as she could
command
.
After a few moments, a traveller
chanced to pass in a waggon. Emily's
companion was attracted to the window.
Harrington followed her, and looking
earnestly at the traveller, he said
carelessly
,
That young man favours James
Lenoxit is possible it may be him
he paused, and Emily instinctively sprang
towards the window. Reuben looked at
her, and conscience-smitten, she shrunk
back into her chair.
I am told young Lenox is in these
parts, pursued Harrington, and I
judged he might ride over here to see
some of his old friends. Again he
turned his eyes on Emily, hers met his
her face and neck were crimson. I
wish, Judy, said he, to the young
woman
who was still gazing out of the
window
,
that ye would go to the
sewingroom
,
and inquire if my coat is finished?
Judy went, and Emily rose to follow
her. Stop, Emily, said Harrington, in
a low voice, and unobserved by Judy,
laying his hand on her arm, and closing
the door, with all your gettings, get
discretion, young woman: your ready
step, your burning cheeks, would this
L 2
moment have betrayed your secret to
me, if I had not known it before. Nay,
now
you must hear mebe calm, do not
tremble, we have no time to wastetake
this note, said he, restoring her
treasure
,
and be thankful that it fell into
friendly hands. The hint I gave you
was spoken in earnest: James Lenox is
in Lebanon. The silly boy sent a letter
to you sealed; it fell into my hands; it
was my duty to open it, and my duty, as
you well know, I perform at all risks
here it is. Emily hastily caught it
without
observing the diabolical sneer on
Reuben's face. Now mark me, young
woman, he continued. I see it is a
vain struggle you are keeping upye
cannot abide here; and as you are of
the earth earthy, I cannot counsel you
to abideyou shall see that I am your
friend, and will return good for evil.
Lenox urges you to join him at
Lebanon
:
he thinks if he comes here, ye will
not be able to resist the open opposition
of the peopleye'll read his letter, and
ye'll find this is the last day of his stay in
these parts; and if ye do not join him
before to-morrow, he concludes you are
still in bonds to the believers.
I have had the letter in my
possession
four days, and you may thank
yourself
that you have not got it sooner; ye
have fled from me as if I had been a tiger,
or a rattle-snake. Now mark me, if you
take my counsel you'll go to-night quietly
and secretly. Little as you deserve it
from me, it is in my mind to help you:
if you will come to the supper-table with
your cap tied, I'll take it for a signal that
you are determined to go, and I will be
ready one hour after sunset with a waggon
and horses, just at the turning of the road
that leads to North-house. I wish to go
thus early that I may return before
day-light
,
for it is not needful the brethren
should know that I take up for you.
They might not view your departure as
I do; for after all it is but acting up to
your light, which is all we profess to
require
.
Now go, young woman, and the
Lord direct all your steps.
He gazed after her as she passed
through the passage, and exclaimed,
exultingly rubbing his hands, I have
caught herI have caught her at last.
Let the fox but clear the ground, and the
old one may bark till doomsday.
It was some time after Emily reached
her own apartment before she became
sufficiently composed to read the letter:
her head swam, and her hands shook
violently; but at last, making a great
effort, she did read it. It was filled with
passionate declarations of love, and
earnest
and repeatedentreaties that she would
join the writer at Lebanon, where he said
he should await her four days. He
alleged many very plausible reasons for
not coming to the village. He rested
his earnest suit mainly on his ardent,
devoted attachment to her; but at the
close of the letter he insinuated that if
she did not return to Eton with him, her
grandmother's death must lie at her
door, so much had her desertion of the
poor old lady shattered her health and
spirits.
Emily perused and re-perused the
letter
;
she felt her cheeks burning while
she read it, and she wondered that James
should write in a style so impassioned
`surely he ought not,' she thought, and
the next moment mentally accused
herself
of injustice. `Alas,' she said, `if
my heart beats thus at the bare thought
of meeting him, can I blame him if he
talks in the fashion of the world's
people
?my
head is in such strange
confusion
,
that it may be I do not understand
him aright.'
But every other consideration was
swallowed up in the necessity of coming
to an immediate decision whether to go
or remain. Emily's
convictions
, as they
had been deemed, had gradually
subsided
as her early attachments revived,
and her inclinations for the world
strengthened; and now, no strong tie
remained to be broken but her love for
the elder sister, which had produced such
habitual dependence on her, that she
had become a mere machine governed
by a power which she could neither
understand
nor resist.
There was now a demand on her for
extraordinary energy, she must act
independently
,
promptly, and secretly. Her
mind was tempest-tost, and while the
sore conflict lasted, reason threatened at
every moment to abandon the helm.
Much cause as she had to distrust
Harrington's
integrity, she did not on this
occasion doubt the sincerity of his
kindness
.
Her mind was engrossed by the
great circumstance of her departure, and
she scarcely thought of the means by
which it was to be effected. Once,
indeed
,
the thought flitted across her mind,
that Reuben's compassionate
interference
in her behalf was very strange, and
for the moment she felt an almost
invincible
repugnance to trust herself with
him; but there was no alternative, she
had no other means of meeting James.
She could, it was true, declare her
resolution
to leave the society. No one was
ever detained by physical force; but to
a weak and irresolute mind there are
moral barriers that are as impassable as
prison-walls, and Emily felt that she had
not the courage necessary to persevere
against the deliberate opposition of the
society, to withstand the counsel, rebuke,
or sneer that she must expect from the
different characters that composed that
strange community, and above all to
meet the elder sister's eye. But how
could she bear to deceive her, to steal
away from her tenderest friend as from
an enemy! The thought of making this
treacherous return to her maternal
kindness
quite overcame the poor girl, and
L 3
Susan entering at this moment, found
her wringing her hands and sobbing most
piteously.
What has happened to you, Emily,
child? she asked, in her kindest voice:
this distress is something more than
common with you.
Emily made no other reply than by
throwing her arms around Susan's neck,
and hiding her face on her bosom.
Nay, child, said Susan, folding her
arms around her, ye must not. It is
but a tempting of Providence. Ye'll be
quite worn out in the struggle, and if
ye cannot conquer, whyye had better
yield.
`Now, now, if ever,' thought Emily,
`is the moment;' and she raised her
head from Susan's bosom with the full
purpose of confessing her weakness and
her wishes. But when she lifted her
tearful eyes, and saw the calm fixed
resolution marked on the elder sister's
face, and met her eye in which there
was the majesty of command, it awed
her spirit as that of man is said to awe
the inferior animals. Her head fell again
on Susan's bosom. Ye are a strange
wayward child, said she: I am sorry
to leave you at this moment, she added
nay, do not start, I shall return
to-morrow.
To-morrow! echoed Emily,
Yea to-morrow; and Judy has
promised
to keep you company to-night.
One of the elders at Lebanon draws
near his end, and they have sent for me,
to consult upon some temporalities to be
settled before his departure. Now sit
down and compose yourselfit troubles
me to leave you thus.
Susan led Emily to a chair, and at
this moment one of the sisters gave her
notice that the brethren were already in
the waggon and waiting for her. While
she hastened her preparations, she
exhorted
Emily to be more tranquil, and
above all not to permit any one to see
how far the adversary yet maintained his
power over her. Emily, though she
groaned aloud as the door closed after
the elder sister, suffered her to depart
without any farther communication.
She passed the remainder of the day
in severe struggles; but finally, at the
close of it, she came to the supper-table
leaning on Judy, with her cap tied; and
one hour after, having evaded her
companion's
observation, she stole,
unnoticed
by any one, to the appointed place
of rendezvous, where she found
Harrington
,
and took with him the road to
Lebanon
.
Harrington, for reasons all important
to himself, abandoned the road usually
travelled, and turned at the western
extremity of the village, into one which
passes in a northerly direction over the
mountain to the town of Lebanon.
There are on this sequestered road but
two or three habitations for a distance
of several miles, and though it presents
many enchanting views of the uplands
and vallies, and ought therefore to
attract
the lovers of the picturesque, few
of that (in our country) small and select
class ever heard of it; and business
travellers preferring the more levelled
and turnpike road, this remains
unfrequented
and grass-grown.
The necessity that Harrington should
reach Albany with all possible
expedition
,
and execute his business there before
it was practicable that he should be
overtaken
,
forbade his permitting Emily to
remain in ignorance of his purposes, and
he had scarcely passed the boundary of
the village, before he began to unfold
them to her. His language was entirely
changedall the mysterious phrases,
and the obscure and technical words,
with which he was wont, as he expressed
himself, to `sanctify his discourse,' to
guard it with equivocal meanings, and
veil it in unintelligible terms, were
exchanged
for the concise language of the
man of business. Emily soon
comprehended
that she was the dupe of his arts
`that the decoy letter was forged by
him, after the model of the note, (he, as
he boasted, holding the pen of a ready
writer)that James Lenox neither
expected
nor wished for herand finally,
that her reputation being destroyed by
her elopement with Harrington, her only
resource was to proceed with him,
without
any ado, to the nearest justice, who
could perform the marriage ceremony,
to accept his hand, which he
generously
proffered, and then pursue her way with
him to Albany, where he insultingly
concluded
he should possess himself of a
sum of money that would enable him to
make a lady of her for the rest of her
life.'
Emily heard him through with
dismay
;
and springing from his side, she
would have cleared the waggon in an
instant, but he perceiving her design,
passed his arm around her, and pulled
her back on to the seat, and there
detained
her in his strong grasp. She
screamed for help with reiterated cries,
and the only answer she received was,
be quiet, sweetheartyou spend your
breath in vainthere is nothing in these
woods to hear you but the bats and owls
no `elder sister' to snatch you from
me.
Oh! exclaimed Emily, turning to
him with a look of helplessness and
appeal
that might have awakened
compassion
in a tiger. Oh, do pity me.
Pity you, indeed! he replied; I
have none of that article on hand: I used
it all upon myself while I staid among
those devilish fools. Take wit in your
anger, girlwhat can't be cured must
be endured. I foresaw that I should
have trouble with your stubborn nature,
and I have provided accordingly. But
fair play is a jewel, and the Lord knows,
I would like to treat you handsomely, if
you will hear to reason and let me.
They had now nearly attained the
summit
of the hill, and Harrington stopped
his horses. Now, Emily Allen, said
he, I leave it to your free choice to go
with me to the first justice we can find,
and there quietly, and as it were,
willingly
,
be lawfully made Mrs. Harrington,
so that man can't put asunder what God
joins togetheror abide here, where I
have bespoke a cage and a keeper for you
till my return, when you will be glad
enough to take me on my own terms.
Emily listened in silence to the
particulars
of the wretch's plot against her:
her whole frame trembled, and her lips
quivered: she made no other reply than
by attempting again to scream for help,
but her voice was so faint and incapable
of articulation, that it sounded like the
smothered cry of a person attempting to
scream in the agony of a frightful dream.
Well, said Reuben, after pausing
but a moment, if you won't hear to
reason, you must e'en abide by the
consequences
.
He then turned his horses
from the road into a deeply shaded
passage
through the woods, where, by the
imperfect star-light, not a trace of a
footstep
could be discerned. The way
however
had been used, during the winter,
for the transportation of wood to the
neighbouring villages, and was sufficiently
cleared from impediments, to allow the
cautious Reuben to pass slowly and safely
through it. Emily looked around her in
utter despairshe cast her eyes up to the
heavens as if to appeal for mercy there
their stillness and serene beauty seemed
to mock and aggravate her misery: she
tried to frame a mental petition to the
only Power that could rescue her, but
her mind was so shaken by terror that
she could not command her thoughts for
the effort.
They had proceeded about half a mile,
and Harrington again stopped. A bright
light streamed through a vista in the
woods on their right. Emily looked in
the direction whence it proceeded, and
saw, through the open door of a hovel,
a human figure enveloped in a blanket,
and extended on the ground before a
blazing fire. The light played fitfully
on the figure, now almost dying away,
and then streaming upward nearly to the
aperture in the roof through which the
smoke found its way. Happily
imagination
could not aggravate her terrors,
and now fully aware of her own
helplessness
,
she sat as still as if she had been
turned to stone, while Harrington
vociferated
Holla! Sooduckdoctor! the
devil take the lazy loon, is he asleep or
drunk? Reuben's repeated calls at
length roused a dog, whose head laid on
his master's bosom, and his barking
awakened the sleeper. He raised his
head, shook back the long black locks
that shaded his eyes, and looked around
as if uncertain whence the sound had
proceeded.
Who's wanting the doctor? he
asked, in a surly tone: foolswill they
never learn not to come to me at the
moon's full?
He then drew his blanket around him,
and was about to resume his sleeping
posture, when Harrington roused him
effectually. Here, Sooduck, he
screamed, here I am on the spot;
have you forgotten, old fellow? Here
is the jug well filled, and here is the
girl.
Ah! is it you, friend Reuben? Here
I am, true as steel, watching for you.
A devil of a pretty watch you keep,
muttered Harrington. Come, come
along, doctor, I have no time to lose,
every minute is worth a golden guinea
to me. The old man moved slowly
and with difficulty towards the waggon
why how now, Emily, girl,
continued
Harrington, it's hard parting,
is it. She clings to me, doctor, like a
bur.
What have you brought here?
asked the old man, looking inquiringly
at Emily, who, quite spent with terror,
had sunk insensible into Harrington's
arms. No, no, friend, he added,
turning away, since the breath is gone,
I'll have nothing to do with her: it is bad
luck meddling with the dead, and there
was no death in the bargain.
Stop, you old fool, exclaimed
Harrington
.
Fool, I may be, friend Reuben, but
I'll not be fool to a foolI tell you again
I'll not undertake with the dead.
Excuse me, doctor, said Reuben,
in a moderated soothing tone, you have
mistaken your case for the first time in
your life: the girl is no more dead than
you or Ishe is as fearful as a fawn,
Sooduck, and your old Indian face has
frightened her out of her witsshe is
faint too, poor little sweetheart, with
grief at parting. Here, take the jug
first, he added, well knowing that he
offered an argument irresistible to
Sooduck
:
there is life of man for you,
doctorit will make your lazy blood
race through your old veins again, and
warm your cold heart to do a good turn
to a friend.
Ah Reuben, Reuben, replied the
old man, grasping the jug and
swallowing
a draught from it, you know what
is needful. The stuff, he added, after
repeating the application, has put life
into me alreadynow give me my
prisoner
and be off.
Reuben, with the little aid that
Sooduck
was able to afford him, succeeded
in lifting Emily from the waggon and
conveying her to the hut, where he
placed her on some fresh straw that
appeared to have been provided for the
purpose, and then left her, enjoining it on
the old man to watch her narrowly and
treat her kindly. After having once
gone to the waggon, he returned to advise
Sooduck to administer a sleeping potion;
`it would save trouble,' he said, `and
make safe work.'
Never you fear, friend Reuben,
replied
Sooduck; trust me and my dog
to guard this little she pigeon.
Harrington
thought there was in truth very
little to apprehend, and he departed
exulting
in the expectation of the final
success of his savage scheme.
Emily soon recovered from her
fainting
fit, but she passed the night in a state
of nervous excitement, little short of
distraction
.
Before morning, however, she
sunk into a quiet sleep, in consequence
of a composing draught, which Sooduck
half compelled and half persuaded her to
swallow. Repose had its usual
beneficent
effects, and she awoke with the first
beam of daylight quite tranquillized. She
had now for the first time sufficient
presence
of mind to examine her prison and
her jailor. The hut was about ten feet
square, and constructed of slender poles
well secured in the ground, and bent
together at the upper extremity in the
form of an arbour: the sides and top
were filled in with flexible brush-wood,
closely matted together. Some brans
and ashes, the relics of the evening's fire,
laid on and about two flat stones, which
composed the fire-place. A chair, so
rough that one might have fancied it the
first barbarous essay towards forming
that indispensable domestic article; an
iron pot, and two skillets, were the only
furniture of this tenement, rude as the
rudest structures of the primitive
inhabitants
.
The remnant of an Indian cake,
laid on a scorched board near the
firestones
,
and some trout, that had been
caught the preceding day in a mountain
stream, were languidly moving in a large
wooden bowl nearly filled with water.
Sooduck, still stupified by the copious
draughts he had taken from Reuben's
jug, was stretched on a mat before the
doorhis dog laid beside him. The
faithful animal ever and anon would start
from his sleep, look inquiringly around
him, lick his master's face, and fall asleep
again on his bosom.
Sooduck the Indian (for such he was)
had all the peculiarities of his race.
Though so old that he looked as if `death
had forgotten to strike him,' his gigantic
form was still erect and muscular. In
vain Emily explored his long face, as the
increasing light of day revealed its rigid
lines and worn channels, for some trace of
humanity, some signal of compassion;
but it was a visage to pierce the heart of
one who sought for mercy with utter
despair
a
visage in which brutal sensuality
was mingled with a fierceness that
neither
time nor events could tame. She
remembered to have heard this man
described
,
and marvellous medical skill
imputed
to him. She recognised some of
the signs of his profession hanging around
the interior of his hut; strings of the
rattles of rattle-snakesskins of snakes
snakes salted and dried in the air
bunches of herbs and rootsthe plumage
of birdstheir carcasses and eggsin
short, he seemed to have levied his
contributions
equally on the elements of
earth, air, and water.
There are still, in the most civilized
parts of our country, some individuals of
the aboriginal race, who, like the
remnants
of their sacrifice-rocks, remain
among us monuments of past ages. They
seek the most secluded and wildest spots,
where the face of nature, yet untouched
by man, expresses some sympathy for
themowns an alliance with them. Some
of them are pretenders to medical skill,
and receive the significant appellation of
root doctors. They no longer affect
to possess the charms, and use the spells
of the ancient
pow-wows
, but their
preparations
are made with a studied
secrecy
which, by its influence over the
imaginations of the vulgar, answers the
purpose of magic. Without taxing our
VOL. II. M
credulity to believe in all the marvellous
cures that are ascribed to them, we see
no reason why the simples they extract
from the bosom of our kind mother
earth should not prove as innocent and
quite as efficacious as the drugs of the
foreign soils.
Every one has felt the inspiring
influence
of returning day-lightthe most
timid are emboldened by it. Emily
inhaled
the cool and fragrant morning air:
she saw through the open door the dewy
foliage glittering in the sun-beams, and
the cheerful light that chequered the
shaded foot-path, and the still voice of
nature seemed to whisper
encouragement
to her spirit. She heard the shrill
voice of the lark, and the clear note of
the robin, and they sounded in her ear
like the voices of her familiar friends.
Exhausted as she was by long sufferings
and recent terrors, hope nerved her to
attempt her liberty. The rattling of the
straw, as she moved from it, startled the
vigilant dog; she saw him fix his eye
upon her, and looking around for some
means of diverting his attention, she
espied a piece of dried meat hanging
over the door; she cautiously took it
down, stooped over him, and patted him
coaxingly, while she offered him the
tempting bribe, but he shook off her
arm, and with a low growl expressed his
disdain of her arts.
Finding the dog impracticable, she
trusted that he would not be able to
awaken his master from his deep sleep,
and stealing timidly around his feet, and
having attained the threshold of the
door, she ascertained by one fearful
glance, that he still slept soundly, and
rashly bounded over the door-step; but
she was suddenly arrested by the dog,
who having jealously watched her stolen
movements, now sprang after her, and
caught her garments between his teeth.
While she made an effort to extricate
herself, the yelping of the animal awoke
M 2
his master, who growled on her more
fiercely than his dog. She turned
towards
him, and sunk on her knees, and
with tears and entreaties besought him,
as he hoped for that mercy from
Heaven
,
which he would so soon need, that
he would have mercy on her. He
heeded her no more than if she had
spoken
to him in a dead language; and
after gazing on her for a few moments,
silently, and with a mixture of sullen
anger and brute indifference, he
commended
and caressed his dog, and then
pulled the helpless despairing girl into
the hut. She sunk back on her straw
bed, while Sooduck, apparently
unconscious
of her sobs, and even of her
presence
,
proceeded to make preparations
for his breakfast.
He first whetted his appetite by a
copious draught of Reuben's liquor, and
then kindled a fire, on which, without
any fastidious preparation, he threw the
still gasping trout. When they were
but half roasted, he offered one on a
piece of Indian cake to Emily, who, as
might be anticipated, rejected his
hospitality
,
though her fast had been a long
one. Quite unaffected by the scruples
of his guest, Sooduck devoured his
savage repast with a voracious appetite.
He then left the hut, secured the door
as well as he was able with a stout cord,
and attaching his dog by his collar to a
chain which was fastened in a staple
driven into one of the upright posts, he
left the trusty animal to guard his
prisoner
,
while he with his pole and line
sauntered to a little brook near his
dwelling, but hidden by a thick growth
of trees which it nourished on its sides.
Emily remained stretched on her rude
bed, now giving way to a burst of grief,
as the recollection of the past, or the
gloomy portents of the future
over-powered
her, and now relapsing into
profound silence, rendered more
grievous
by the sweet music of nature, which
struck on the poor prisoner's sickening
sense. The melody of the birds, as they
flew about her prison-house, breathed
freedom and gladness, and the brook,
which she distinctly heard as it gurgled
around the roots of the trees that
impeded
its way, or bounded over the
stones that vainly obstructed its free
passage, conveyed to her the song of
liberty.
She was sometimes startled by the
shrill whistle of the Indian, who, still
pursuing his drowsy pleasure in the
shelter of the wood, sent his greeting to
his dog, whose hoarse response answered
the purpose of the sentinel call of All
is well!
CHAPTER XVII.
Proud of her parts, but gracious in her pride
She bore a gay good-nature in her face,
And in her air was dignity and grace.
Crabbe
.
While
the transactions so fatal to the
peace of Emily Allen were going on,
Deborah and Ellen were quietly
pursuing
their journey, though not as
expeditiously
as Ellen could have wished.
She had not, as has been seen, left Eton
in the most tranquil state of mind; and
she was perhaps more impatient at the
little accidents that retarded their
progress
,
than she would have been at
another
time, or under other circumstances.
Sometimes the old racked chaise needed
repairsometimes the horse, who, as
Deborah said, had, like herself, seen
better and stronger days, and needed to
be favoured, required a day's delay
and sometimes they came into the
neighbourhood
of an old acquaintance or
faroff
cousin of Deborah's, and she judged
it right to diverge from their direct route
to prove to them her friendly
remembrance
;
for she scrupulously maintained
the New-England custom (which among
the degenerate moderns is becoming a
little unfashionable) of noticing a
relative
to the remotest degree. Ellen often
felt inclined to remonstrate against these
repeated delays; but Deborah was so
much accustomed to exercise the petty
tyranny of having her own way, that
Ellen rightly concluded it would be
much easier for her to acquiesce, than
for Deborah to relinquish her habitual
control.
Ten days had elapsed, when they
stopped at a village inn in the vicinity
of the shaker settlement at Hancock:
an hostler advanced to take charge of
the horse: Deborah, before she resigned
the reins, gave to him the most minute
directions as to the refection of her
beast; but the man, puffed up with the
transient importance which he derived
from an unusual concourse of travellers
that had filled the stables and stable-yards
of the inn with fine horses and fine
equipages
,
was evidently quite heedless of
Miss Debby's directions. She at last had
recourse to the usual expedient of
travellers
,
and though she utterly
disapproved
the use of such appliances, which
she thought were little better than
bribery
and corruption, she reluctantly
drew a fourpence-halfpenny from her
pocket, and giving it to the man, with
the air of one who offers ample
consideration
for `value received,'Here,
said she, take this, and deal kindly
with the beast  poor fellow, he has had
a tough morning of it, what with the
heat and the hills.
The hostler took the bit of money,
M 3
looked at it, and turned it over with
mock gravity, balanced it on the end of
his finger, as if weighing it, and then
tossed it high in air, accompanying this
last expression of his contempt with an
insolent laugh, in which he was joined
by half-a-dozen of his associates who had
gathered around him.
Deborah picked up the money as it
fell, and deliberately replacing it in her
pocket, said with perfect coolness, A
fool and his money are soon parted
this is a right punishment for my giving
in to these new-fangled ways. Here,
fellow, give me the reins, and call the
master of the house to me.
This appeal to his principal reduced
the menial to his proper insignificance,
and turned the laugh against him, and
Deborah remained fairly mistress of the
field, till the landlord made his
appearance
.
The raised voices of the different
parties attracted several persons to the
windows and door of the inn, and Ellen
felt herself rather awkwardly situated as
she stood awaiting the termination of
Deborah's arrangements.
Walk in, Miss, walk in, said the
landlord to her: here, this way, in the
parlour: the house is considerable full,
but you'll find room enough to spare yet
I'll attend to your motherwalk in.
The attention was now withdrawn
from Deborah to Ellen, and each
observer
probably noticed the disparity
between the supposed mother and
daughter.
Impossible, whispered a young
man who stood in the door-way to a lady
beside him; that she-grenadier cannot
be mother to this pretty graceful girl.
Impossible is a rash word for you,
Mr. Philosopher, replied the young
lady: look there, she added, pointing
to a prickly pear in flower, there are
strange productionsodd relations in
nature.
Ellen's ear caught enough of these
remarks as she passed along, to inform
her that she was the subject of them;
and her embarrasmeut was increased
when the landlord opened the parlour
door to usher her in, and she perceived
that the room was already occupied by
a large party of travellersshe shrunk
back, and begged her conductor to show
her to a private apartment. He said that
was impossible, for his rooms were all
taken up. The young lady at the door
observed Ellen's embarrassment, and
advancing
,
with a mixture of good-nature
and graceful politeness, begged Ellen to
enter.
Our party, she said, is of such an
unconscionable size! We travel en
masse like the patriarchsmen, women,
and childrenand much cattle, and
when we have gained possession of a
territory we are quite terrible; but the
parlour of a country inn you know is
neutral ground, where all parties have
equal rights.
A smile and a bow from Ellen
expressed
her sense of the proffered
courtesy
,
and she passed and seated herself
at an unoccupied window.
You are a rash woman, Miss
Campbell
,
said the gentleman in a low voice,
whom Ellen had first seen at the door,
and who had followed her to the parlour.
I see a storm lowering on Mrs.
Norton's
brow, and I fear she will not
permit
you the privilege of neutrality.
I care not, Mr. Howardthe motto
of my family arms is, `dauntless in war,
gentle in peace.'
My family's boastful motto also,
replied Mr. Howard.
Indeed! exclaimed Miss Campbell,
that is singular; but I hope you are
not ashamed of it, noticing a little
embarrassment
in Mr. Howard's manner.
Oh, certainly not; though one
might blush at thinking how little we
degenerate sons can do in these peaceful
times to verify the pretensions of our
fighting forefathersbut see, the storm
is ready to burst on your devoted head.
Mrs. Norton is beckoning to youand
even that look of invincible good-nature
which you have assumed will not mollify
her. Mr. Howard's eyes followed Miss
Campbell with an expression that seemed
to say, `that look is as potent as the
beauty that in the olden time disarmed
the wild beasts of their ferocity.'
My dear Miss Campbell, began
Mrs. Norton, drawing up her severe
features
to as stern an expression, as if she
was taking up her testimony against the
depravity of the age. My dear Miss
Campbell, I really wonder at you.
Wonder! Can you, Mrs. Norton,
condescend to so vulgar an emotion as
wonder?
But I am serious, Miss Grace.
So I perceive, ma'am.
There can be no doubt, I fancy that
you understand me?
Indeed I have not that pleasure.
Few things are more mortifying to a
person of self-consequence, than to be
called on to explain the cause of a
personal
irritation, which he had imagined
quite obvious. After a little fidgetting
on her chair, and clearing of her throat,
all which Miss Campbell awaited with
the most provoking serenity, the lady
spoke with the manner of one who in
her own little sphere had been looked
upon as quite oracular.
Miss Campbell, it has ever been my
opinion, confirmed by all my
experience
,
and I have had more than most
people;she paused again, probably
from the difficulty of giving sufficient
dignity to a very small subject, and
Miss Campbell slipped in
Incontrovertibly
,
ma'am, few people live to be
more than three-score.
I did not mean, Miss Grace, the
experience
of age; every one who lives
to a certain time has thatbut the
experience
of
Wisdom, ma'amsagacious
observation
,
&c. &c. I understand you.
Oh, cousin Grace, you are such a
tease, said a young lady who sat at
Mrs. Norton's right hand, and who
perceived
she was quite as much provoked
by being understood, as by not being
understood.
Your cousin Grace, said Mrs.
Norton, may teaze you young ladies,
Miss Sarah, but I assure you that I am
not a subject for teazing.
My dear Sarah, said Miss
Campbell
,
with affected gravity, how could
you suspect me of taking such high aim
you know mine are all random shafts,
and if they wound, are `heaven directed;'
but, Mrs. Norton, pray do not deprive
me of that valuable opinion of yours
the result, if I remember, of unparalleled
experience.
I shall not be deterred from
expressing
it by your ridicule, Miss Campbell;
self-respect renders one quite superior to
ridicule.
Self-respect renders one quite superior
to ridicule, repeated Miss Campbell
with deliberation and emphasisat the
same time taking out her pocket-book,
seemingly with the purpose of recording
on her tablets Mrs. Norton's saying
self respect, she again repeated, as
she drew out her pencil, when Mrs.
Norton stopped her by exclaiming
Do you mean to insult me, Miss
Campbell?
Insult you! my dear Mrs. Norton,
Lord bless me! noreally if I have been
so unfortunate as to misunderstand you
again, you must not lay all the blame
on my poor intellects; for you talk so
much in the style of the venerable
Greeks, to such a dissultory personage
as I am every sentence sounds like an
apophthegm.
Mrs. Armstead, the aunt of Miss
Campbell, thought her niece was
carrying
matters too farshe perceived that
Mrs. Norton felt as awkwardly as a
warrior
of the olden time who should be in
his heavy coat of mail, assaulted by a
light armed soldier of the present day.
My dear Grace, she said, you
have not allowed Mrs. Norton time to
explain herself. She noticed the
companion
of the young woman, towards
whom you have thought proper to give
yourself such an air of patronising
hospitality
,
in an altercation with the
hostlershe says she is an excessively
vulgar woman, and she thinks, my dear,
that it is a great piece of presumption
for this young woman to come into our
parlour without an invitation, and
rather ill-advised in you to encourage
her assurance.
Thank you, my dear aunt, replied
Grace Campbell, bowing her head with
affected deference, for possessing me
of Mrs. Norton's views of my conduct;
and now, my dear madam, she added,
turning to Mrs. Norton, pray do not
withhold from me your own expression
of your golden opinion.
Mrs. Norton had strong motives for
keeping well with Miss Campbell: she
was conscious that the lady's fortune,
fashion, and talents placed her in the
first class, let her make that class as
small as she would. She had been
excessively
provoked at Miss Campbell's
contempt, or at best indifference for her,
but, having no alternative, she made to
herself a great merit of forgiveness,
obliged to suppress her wrath against
Miss Campbell, she meant to indemnify
herself by wreaking her vengeance on
the innocent stranger, and when she
spoke, she spoke calmly, but loud enough
to be heard by Ellen.
Miss Grace, she said, there is
much excuse for one who is ignorant of
the presumption of the common people:
you have lived for the most part in town,
where you did not come in contact with
them.
Yesunfortunately, Mrs. Norton,
but I have now and then taken a trip to
the country, and indemnified myself for
the privation. There is nothing in life
so tiresome to me as the genteel
gentlemen
and ladies one meets for ever in
townwe flatter one another's
prejudices
we
adopt one another's opinions
and tastes and habits till every thing
individual
and peculiar is gonewe are all
formed in the same mould, and all
receive
the same impressionpure gold
and base copperall must bear the same
stamp to be current coin. It is a
refreshment
to me to see the natural character
as it is developed in the strong
peculiarities
one meets in the country. I love
the common peoplean unpardonable
sin it may be, Mrs. Norton, but I do
love themI love to see the
undisciplined
movements of natural feelingI
sympathise with their unaffected griefs
I love to witness their hearty pleasures
I had rather receive the expression of their
cordial good-will than the compliments
of a successful winter's campaign
For heaven's sake tell me, cousin
Grace, said a gentleman who was
standing near to her, are you
addressing
this tirade in favour of rusticity to
Mrs. Norton or to Howard?
A deep blush suffused Miss Campbell's,
cheeks; she was conscious that though
she had in the onset addressed herself
to Mrs. Norton, she had involuntarily,
and in obedience to the impulse of
sympathy
,
directed her eyes to Howard.
the blush was followed by a beautiful
smile, as she replied to her cousinIs
it strange, William, that my enthusiasm
in behalf of the contemned and neglected
should impel my eyes instinctively to
a Howard?
Beware instinct, Howardinstinct
is a great matter, whispered young
Armstead, and added aloud, do not
bow so like simple Mr. Slender, as if
you believed every word of that
rattlebrained
cousin of mine. She has drank
a draught of sentiment this morning on
these romantic hills; but this love of the
country and its sweet simplicity is not
her first love: she will return to town,
and run the course of fashion and folly
with the swiftest of her rivals.
For shame, my son: I will not suffer
your insinuations against Grace, said
Mrs. Armstead; I am sure she was
never fond of dissipation.
Oh no, my dear mother; dissipation
is a self denying ordinance with Grace;
and the admiration of half the men, and
the envy of all the women, are her
voluntary mortifications.
Ah, Will, replied Miss Campbell,
you are a snarlera predestined old
bachelorbut you shall see that I will
deny the world and all ungodliness
forswear your company, and live soberly
in this present life.
I am certain Miss Campbell has the
ability to verify the prophecy she utters,
said Howard.
I see it is all in vain, my good
friends, retorted young Armstead,
assuming the gravity of a sage; you
pour in your poisons faster than I can
administer my antidotes; so go on, and
in a few years you will drive my cousin
Grace, in spite of her good sense, into
the rank of the infallibles: our dear
mother would even now persuade you,
Grace, as the worthy Bishop Hoadley
said, `not that you cannot err, but that
you do not err.'
My good aunt's blindness is not
likely to prove fatal to me while I have
so clear-sighted a cousin, who with one
keen glance of his eye can pierce the
fog of vanity. But here, William,
comes a newer if not fairer subject for
your sharp-shooting.
All eyes were now directed to the
door, and Deborah entered.
The pause occasioned by her entrance
gave Mrs. Norton an opportunity to
speak, and obliged others to listen to
her. She poured forth many wise
maxims upon the necessity of jealously
guarding the few distinctions of rank
that remained among us, and concluded
with the condescending declaration, that
she always made it a point to speak to
persons she met at an inn, but she took
good care they should understand, `thus
far shalt thou come and no farther.'
Young Armstead ventured to express
a fear that the wave of the multitude
would be too strong for her supreme
command; but for the most part the
good lady talked without being heeded.
Every eye seemed fixed on Deborah,
who on entering had given a good
natured
nod to the Armstead party, and
had proceeded in her operations with as
much nonchalance as if she had been in
her own little bed room at home and
mistress of all she surveyed. She walked
up to a small looking-glassthrew aside
her bonnet, and began smoothing her
refractory locks with a pocket-comb,
while she recounted to Ellen, in her
homeliest phrase, and with the
exultation
of a victor, her success in
securing
the best hospitalities of the
manger
for her good steed, and boasted that
like a faithful mistress, she had insisted
on being an eye-witness of his
accommodations
.
It must be confessed that Ellen felt a
little disturbed at the ludicrous figure
her companion made in the eyes of the
fashionable party who were observing
her. She perceived that the mirth of
the young people was only kept within
decent limits by the gravity of their
elders, and that gravity was
maintained
by a difficult effort. She averted her
eyes and looked out of the window,
when Deborah who had finished her
VOL. II. N
toilette, and was surveying some
pictures
that garnished the walls, again
exacted
her attention.
For the land's sake, Ellen, she said
come and look at these pictures and tell
me what this meanshere is something
that puzzles me; and she fixed her
eyes on an embroidered Hector and
Andromache
,
the fruit at least of three
months' labour of one of the young lady
artists of the inn.
That man, she said pointing to the
Trojan hero, is dressed in the uniform
of the Connecticut reg'lars, at least it is
as much like that as any thing, and I
take it to be the likeness of Col. Smith.
I remember he had a wife and one child,
and he parted from them just before the
battle of Garmantown, where he lost
his life, and a great many other brave
fellows that have never been stitched
into a pictur, lost theirs too. It's always
your generals and colonels that get all
the profit and honour while they live,
and the glory when they are gone,
while the poor fellows that suffer
hunger
and cold die, and are never named
nor thought of. But what signifies it;
for the `same event happeneth to all,'
as Solomon says.
And it is the honest life that
precedes
the `event,' and not the honour
which follows it, that makes all the
difference
,
said Miss Campbell, advancing
to Deborah, and entering into her
feelings
with evident pleasure,
Very true, Missand very well
said, replied Debby, heartily.
Maybe
Miss, she added, with an earnest
manner, which indicated that a very
slight observation of Miss Campbell
had inspired a great respect for her
powers, maybe Miss, you can help
Ellen explain these outlandish names
that puzzle me. I am sure there was
not in all the Connecticut reg'lars such
a name as Hector, and as to the other,
I can't make any thing out of it.
N 2
They are fancy names I imagine,
said Ellen, willing to avoid an
explanation
.
Deborah passed on to a coarse
engraving
of Solomon's temple, which
she gazed on with at least as honest a
rapture as a connoisseur would have
felt at the cartoons of Raphael. She
commented on its length, breadth, and
depth, with critical accuracy, observed
the number of porches, pillars, windows
and doors, and concluded with
expressing
her delight that she had `at last
seen a pictur of old king Solomon's
temple.'
Deborah poured forth her comments
without heeding the whispers, the stares
and smiles that her oddity excited; but
Ellen saw and heard all; and more
pained that her honest friend should be
the subject of ridicule, than mortified
on her own account, she drew her out
of the room into the little piazza in
front of the house, and earnestly
recommended
their proceeding on their
journey immediately. Her arguments
however had no weight with Deborah;
but while she still urged them, their
attention
was attracted by an alarming
outcry. The cause of it was at once
obvious. A chaise had been overset in
the village street, the horse was running
with the broken vehicle at his heels at
full speed, while half a score of men
where in breathless pursuit; a little
child stood in the road before the door,
his danger was apparent, and his
destruction
seemed inevitable: the party
in the house joined their cries to those
in the street, while a voice of terror and
agony loud above all the rest, screamed,
my
child,
my
child! The horse
received
a new impetus from these
frightful
screams, while the little fellow stood
facing the danger quite unappalled, and
resolutely threw his hat at the horse.
Deborah and Ellen darted forward
at the same instantDeborah attempted
N 3
to stop the horse: she failed in that,
but the force of her arm turned him
aside from his course, while Ellen
snatched the child, and turning, placed
it in the arms of its mother, who had
just reached the door, and trembling,
almost fainting, extended them to
receive
her child. This was all the
operation
of an instant. The whole party
from the parlour now surrounded
Deborah
and Ellen.
Mrs. Armstead, (for she was the
mother) as soon as she had tranquillized
her feelings sufficiently to speak,
overwhelmed
the preservers of her child
with expressions of gratitude. The
brothers and sisters crowded about, and
embraced the little boy who seemed to
wonder why he had caused such
emotion
;
while Miss Campbell advancing to
Ellen, and gracefully offering her hand,
said, that her llittle 'scape-death
cousin
had obtained for her the right to beg
the name and acquaintance of her whose
kind intervention had saved his life.
She proceeded to lavish praises on Ellen
for her prompt courage; but Ellen
modestly declined them, saying, she
had been impelled by instinct to the
action, and was quite unconscious of any
danger till it was past.
The ice being thus broken, the young
ladies, after discussing every particular
of the `hair breadth 'scape,' proceeded
to an animated conversation on various
subjects, which elicited the characters
of each, and inspired them with mutual
admiration. Perhaps they liked each
other the better because, though there
was a general agreement between them
in tastes and sentiments, there was a
striking difference in some particulars.
Ellen's manners, without any of the
awkwardness or gaucherie of
bashfulness
or ignorance, were timid, and, with
strangers, rather reserved and retiring;
while Miss Campbell had the assured
air of one who has held a high
command
in society, and whose right and
habit it was to take the lead in the
world of fashion. Ellen, with one of
the sweetest voices in the world, talked
in rather a low tonethe style of her
conversation was unambitious and
simple
,
and though it often took a rich
colouring from the bright rays of genius
and feeling, like those glowing hues
which fall on the summer landscape,
and which no contrivance of art can
produce or imitate, there was nothing
said to court attention or excite
admiration
.
Miss Campbell talked rather loud,
and with spirit and fluency; she had the
fearless manner of one who has often
felt her own power, and the weakness
of others: she dashed on like an
impetuous
mountain stream, disdaining
obstruction
and careless of opposition.
She had evidently been accustomed to
occupy the fore-ground of the picture,
to be the primary object of attention.
She would have been at a loss to
comprehend
the feeling that suffused Ellen's
face with blushes, and imparted
tremulousness
to her voice, when she found
herself the object of an admiring
observation
.
Miss Campbell had been so
accustomed
to the homage of society, that
the excitement had become as necessary
to her as the applause of an audience to
a popular actor. In the midst of her
most animated and eloquent sallies, her
eye would glance rapidly around her
circle of auditors, to catch new
inspiration
from the silent tribute of their
enchained attention. With these faults,
she had such a fund of good sense, such
invincible good humour and unaffected
benevolence, that she commanded the
love, the respect even of those who were
most sensible of her imperfections. Her
virtues were her own, the luxuriant
growth of a rich soil; her faults the
result of accident, the weeds permitted
by neglect, or occasioned by improper
cultivation. Miss Campbell was not a
regular beauty, but her graceful person
and fine expression gave to her
appearance
the effect of beauty,
Mrs. Armstead, her aunt, resided in
Philadelphia, and was on a jaunt to
Boston by the way of Lebanon springs.
Mrs. Norton was an old acquaintance
and distant relation, whom she had met
accidentally. Mr. Howard had been
introduced
by young Armstead into his
mother's family a few weeks before they
left home, and recommended to their
regard as an old college friend from
Boston.
This introduction is necessary to our
readers, but even these concise
particulars
are more than our travellers
ascertained
of their new friends. The little
boy who had been rescued seemed
to have been struck by the manly
genius of Deborah, and attached
himself
to herand the whole party, with
the exception of Mrs. Norton, were
emulous of showing civility to Deborah,
and admiration of Miss Bruce. Mrs.
Armstead, anxious to improve her brief
opportunity of expressing her gratitude,
lavished her attentions on Ellen, placed
her next herself at table, and melted
away all reserve by the warmth of her
kindness.
The dinner being over, preparations
were made for the departure of all
parties. Deborah's primitive looking
chaise and ancient horse, were led to
the door in the rear of Mrs. Armstead's
elegant carriage, which with the dashing
gig and tandem of her son, and the horses
of their outriders effectually `stopped
the way.' While the servants were
adjusting
some light baggage, dried fruits
and cakes for the young people, the
late publications for their elders, &c. &c.
Miss Campbell said to Ellen, you
must allow me to borrow a
New-England
phrase, to ask whither you are
`journeying?' we cannot part from you
without the hope at least of meeting
again.
It is not impossible we may, replied
Ellen, for my companion has just
announced to me, that if we are
successful
in attaining the object of our
coming
to this vicinity, she intends visiting
Lebanon springs for a few days.
Successful or not successful, Ellen,
interrupted Deborah, I shall go to the
pool, for I hear those waters are a
master-cure
for the rheutmatis.
Oh, I am told quite equal to
Bethesda
,
said Miss Campbell; and as
you take along with you an angel to
trouble them, you may be sure of
experiencing
their efficacy. But seriously,
Miss Bruce, I hope no consideration
will deter you: we are to linger in the
adjacent villages for a day or two, and
then go to Lebanon, and I am certain
that if we are so happy as to meet you
there, my aunt will insist on your
attaching
yourselves to our party.
Grace, said Mrs. Armstead, you
anticipate my wishesyou would indeed,
Miss Bruce, do me a great favour by
enrolling yourselves in my party. And
the young ladies exclaimed, how glad
I shall beand how pleasant it will
be.
Ellen gracefully returned her thanks
to each and all, while Deborah, quite
ignorant of the tactics of the polite
world, comprehended nothing of the
offered
civility, but that it was meant in
kindness, and therefore deserved the
hearty thanks which she replied to it.
Come my dear girls, said Mrs.
Armstead, we must despatch this
leavetaking
;
every thing I see is in readiness.
Our friends, said Miss Campbell,
must start first. Be good enough,
William, to order the servant to lead
forward
VOL. II. O
Miss Lenox's horse. I am sure,
she added smiling, his age and virtues
entitle him to precedence.
The two parties now proceeded to
make their adieus; and the young ladies,
each as they took Ellen's hand, slipped
on her finger a ring, which they begged
her to take for a keepsake.
The little boy, watchful of every thing
concerning his new friends, observed
thishe drew from his pocket a net
purse, through the interstices of which
shone a golden guinea, and swelling
with manly pride, he offered it to
Deborah
.
Deborah patted him on the head, called
him a young prince, said his life was
worth saving, and as a matter of course
she handed the purse to his mother.
Oh no, no, Miss Lenox, said Mrs.
Armstead, you must keep it indeed, it
would quite break my little boy's heart
if you despised his gift.
Despice it, ma'am, rejoined
Deborah
,
surveying it with unfeigned
delight. I was never the owner of a
golden guinea in my life, and I thought
it would be an imposition to take it
but I shall take good care of it, and
she carefully deposited it in her pocket,
adding, Mr. John, your guinea will
seldom see daylight while I live.
The last parting words were saidthe
last kind looks reciprocated, and all
parties arranging themselves in their
own places, Deborah drove off in one
direction, and Mrs. Armstead and her
suite in another. As the children
stretched their necks out of the carriage
to send their last lingering look towards
the old chaise and the humble Rosinante
that drew it heavily along, Mrs
Armstead
remarked, how little the young
and the truly wise estimate that which
is essentially good and lovely by
external
appearances.
As I cannot in conscience, my dear
aunt, said Miss Campbell, take a place
in either of those classes, being not very
young and certainly not belonging to
the `select few' of the `truly wise,' I
must investigate the cause of my prompt
admiration of our new acquaintance.
She shook her head after a moment's
deliberation, and added, I can take no
praise to myself, for that charming
Miss Bruce is a self-evident ladyand
her companionan exception to all rules
just hit one of my wayward fancies.
And I rather think, Grace, said
young Armstead, (who had taken his
sister's place in the carriage,) you
were not sorry to have an opportunity
of giving to our cousin Norton a
practical
instance of your contempt of her
aristocracy
and
of manifesting to another
observer your elevation above the
prejudices
of society.
Miss Campbell did not notice the last
clause of her cousin's sentence except by
a slight blush: she pleaded guilty to
the desire of mortifying the baseless
pride of Mrs. Norton. There was
nothing
,
she said, more essentially
vulgar
than the consequence that betrayed,
by its perpetual vigilance and jealousy,
a consciousness that there existed no
intrinsic
superiorityan exclusive bigoted
spirit ought not to receive any toleration
in our societyit was opposed to the
genius and tendencies of every thing
about uswe were happily exempt from
the servitude of oriental castes, and the
scarcely less arbitrary classifications
of more liberal countries. Superior
talents
educationmannersthe
habits
of refined life, were the only distinctions
that ought to obtain among us, and they
were quite obvious.
Ah coz, I see how it is. Like the
Duchess of Gordon, who replied to the
managers of the city assembly at
New-York
,
when they apologised for not
being able to offer her the precedence to
which her rank entitled her, `never
mind, Gentlemen, wherever I am, there
is the Duchess of Gordon.' Like her
Grace, you are satisfied that Miss
Campbell's
is the first placethat modern
heraldry of merit will always give
precedence
.
Thank you, William, for your
generous
personal application of my principles
you need not shake your headI am in
no danger of mistaking any thing you
say to me for a compliment.
Believe me, Grace, replied her
cousin, affectionately taking her hand,
I never was in more imminent danger
of joining my voice to the coral song of
your flatterers. I sympathise entirely
in your desire to dissipate the illusions of
our conceited, and thank Heaven, `
faroff'
cousin Nortonin your admiration
of our new acquaintance, and in some
other
new
feelings, he added, lowering
his voice to a whisper, that are getting
the mastery in your heartand I pray
heaven you may always shew yourself
as entirely superior to the adventitious
distinctions of the world, as with your
character you may afford to be.
A bona fide compliment from
William
Armstead!Saul among the
prophets
!
exclaimed Grace Campbell.
