CHAP. I.
THE COTTAGE FIRE SIDE.
But
who knows, my dear father, cried
Rebecca
Littleton, laying her hand on that of her
father, who knows but
something
yet may be done
to reward a veteran grown grey in his country's
service
?
I hope there will, my child,
said
Mr. Littleton;
and if there is not we
must
be content, for his
Majesty
,
God
bless
him, cannot provide for all. I
wish
,
my girl, it was in my power to convince him, that I
am
still
willing to fight for him, though the bread I
eat from his bounty is but brown: but with this poor
stump
, looking at all that remained of his right arm,
and this
disabled
leg,
stretching
it out as well as
he could, all my fighting days are over; I can only
talk now, my child.
But you have fought bravely once,
said
Mrs.
Littleton, while a beam of exultation darted from her
eyes.
And after all, cried Rebecca, it is hard to be
distressed
for fifteen pounds.
It was a clear
frosty
evening, in the beginning of
January, when, in a little cottage, on the
sea
coast
of
Lincolnshire
, Mr. Littleton, an old
superannuated
lieutenant
in the army, his wife, daughter, and two or
three neighbours, were comfortably
seated
round a
cheerful fire, the brown jug was
just
replenished
by the
fair hands of Rebecca, and the
song
, the joke, and
the tale went cheerfully round, when an unwelcome
though not unexpected,
visitor
made his appearance,
and threw a damp over their
harmless
mirth.
This was no other than their landlord's
steward
, who
came to demand the rent, in paying which they had
been, from various
disagreeable
reasons
, more
backward
than
usual
; it amounted to fifteen pounds, and
the poor old man had no method whatever to
raise
the
money. He had often made his
distresses
known to
people in power, who had once
styled
themselves
his
friends, but never received any thing more than
promises
that
something
should
be done; but hope had
so
often deceived him, that he now
ceased
to
listen
to her
flattering voice, and was
sinking
into
despondency
,
when the lovely Rebecca cheered him with the
sentence
at the beginning of the chapter.
Rebecca was the
youngest
of
seven
children, and
the only one who lived to years of maturity. She was
at this time
just
sixteen
, and had combined in her
person
all the beauty of a Venus, and the
simplicity
of a
Grace. She
possessed
a
striking
figure,
just
tall enough
to be elegant. Her
shape
was perfect
symmetry
, and
her countenance one of
those
which may
safely
be
pronounced
more than beautiful; for, to the
softest
blue
eyes, flaxen hair, and a complexion that out vied the
lilies, was added
such
an
inexpressible
look of
benevolence
and candour, that it was
impossible
to
see
and
not love her. She had been taught by her father to
read and write her own language correctly, by her
mother
some
little knowledge of the French, and by the
vicar's lady, who was extremely fond of her,
she
had
learned to play, with a
considerable
degree of
taste
, on
the lute; but being educated intirely in the family way,
and never having
past
the boundaries of her native
village
,
except once or twice to a neighbouring fair, there
was about her
such
an air of
modest
timidity, that, by
the
unobserving
, might be
mistaken
for
rustic
bashfulness
.
Though
considered
by her young companions as the
A 5
belle
of the village, in her own opinion
she
was ever the
meanest
, the
least
worthy notice of any. Brought up
in the
strictest
notions of the
protestant
religion,
such
universal
charity pervaded her
soul
, that
she
never
suspected
the worth and integrity of her fellow creatures;
but implicitly believed, that every one, who
prosessed
to love or
esteem
her,
spoke
the genuine feelings of
their hearts.
She harboured no ideas which fear or
shame
prevented
her revealing, for this
reason
, her actions, her
sentiments
,
were often open to the malevolent
misconstructions
of
those
, who, having art
sufficient
to conceal
the real
impulse
of their natures,
assume
the
semblance
of
those
virtues, the reality of which is
possessed
only
by the genuine children of
simplicity
.
In giving the character of Mr. Littleton, we require
but few words; he was
honest
,
possessed
of valour,
good
sense
, and a liberal education.
Mrs. Littleton was twenty years younger than her
husband
, and was, when he married her, remarkably
beautiful. She was the daughter of an
exciseman
, and
at a country boarding
school
had picked up a few
showy
accomplishments
, but her mind had been totally
neglected
;
her
sentiments
were therefore narrow and
illiberal
,
and
she
possessed
that kind of worldly
knowledge
,
which rendered her
suspicious
of the integrity
of every human being.
The little knowledge Rebecca
possessed
of mankind,
she
had gleaned from a
small
, but not ill-
furnished
,
circulating
library, to which all the inhabitants of the
village
subscribed
. Her mind was highly tinctured
with the romantic, but withal was enlightened with
such
a high
sense
of honour, virtue and piety, that it
was
almost
impossible
to lead her to a wrong action;
yet there were times when the fortitude of Rebecca
was vulnerable. She could
stand
unmoved in a right
cause
against
entreaty,
persuasion
, and even the
severest
threats; but
she
was not proof
against
the
shaft
of ridicule.
We have
said
that Mrs. Littleton had been
handsome
indeed,
she
was
so
still
, being at this period but forty
seven
years old; for piercing black eyes,
chesnut
hair,
and a florid complexion, gave her greatly the look of
youth. This juvenile appearance of her mother was a
great misfortune to Rebecca, for Mrs. Littleton was
ever more
pleased
with being told
she
looked like her
eldest
sister
, than in being complimented with being
the mother of
so
lovely a young woman; indeed,
she
considered
every compliment paid to her daughter as
derogating
something
from her own merit. She
considered
her more as a rival than a child, and was happy
in every opportunity to ridicule the feelings of a heart,
of
whose
intrisic
worth
she
had no idea.
Rebecca could not
sometimes
help feeling the
unkindness
of her mother; but whatever
those
feelings
were,
she
suffered
in
silence
; no complaint ever
escaped
her lips, but
she
endeavoured, by the
mildest
acquiescence
in her every
wish
, to conciliate that affection
which
she
would have
considered
as her
greatest
comfort
.
It is hard, indeed, to be
so
distressed
for fifteen
pounds,
said
Rebecca: I
wish
I could hit on any
plan by which my dear father might be relieved from
this
embarrassment
. I have a great mind, if you will
give me leave, to go to-morrow morning to Lady Mary
Worthy; I
saw
her
last
week at the vicar's when
she
asked
me to come and
see
her, and
said
she
should
be
happy to render me any
service
in her power.
And do you think
she
really meant what
she
said
?
cried Mrs. Littleton.
To be
sure
I do, replied Rebecca.
Then you are a fool, retorted the mother, not
to take it, as it was
designed
, a mere compliment,
which
she
paid in
respect
to Mrs. Alton, who,
she
saw
,
was rather partial to you.
Dear mamma
said
Rebecca, in an accent of
surprise
,
how can you think
so
? There was no
necessity
for her to
ask
me, if
she
had not
wished
me to come,
for, you know, I am greatly her inferior.
Don't talk
so
silly
, child! do you
suppose
I
wish
every body to come to my
house
whom
politeness
obliges
me to
ask
?
I can only
say
, mamma, that I would never
ask
any
person
whom I
should
not be really glad to
see
when they came.
I think, my dear,
said
Mr. Littleton (though I
have the
greatest
respect
imaginable for your opinion)
that it would not be
amiss
for Rebecca to go to
Lady
Mary; when
she
knows our
situation
she
may be
prevailed with to
request
her
son
, Sir George, to wait
till we can make up the
sum
: I will, in the mean time,
write to my old friend, Lord Antrim, perhaps, he
may get my
small
pension
enlarged,
Mrs. Littleton remained
silent
, and it was agreed
between Rebecca and her father, that the next
morning
she
should
visit
Audley Park.
CHAP. II.
THE APPLICATION.
At
twelve o'clock, next morning, the lovely
Rebecca
,
habited in a plain white jacket, a
strawhat
,
and black
teresa
,
sat
out for Audley Park.
Lady Mary was alone in the library when
she
arrived
,
and, on the
servant
's announcing her name,
desired
her to be immediately
shown
up.
Now this is really kind,
said
she
, with the
most
condescending
smile
, advancing to the
blushing
Rebecca,
and, taking her hand, led her to the
sofa
on which
she
had been
sitting
, and
seating
herself
by her
side
: I
flatter
myself
you are come to
spend
the day with me.
Indeed, madam, replied Rebecca, I was not
so
presuming
as to hope
such
an honour: I came to
request
to
entreat
she
falteredthe tears
started
in her eyesLady Mary interrupted her.
Speak out, my love; do not be alarmed, but
rest
assured
, I am ready to grant you any favour within
the limits of my power.
You are very good, madam. I hope you will
pardon
the liberty I have taken; but my father, madam
his income is very
small
we are a
twelve-month
in arrears in our rentif you will kindly
use
your
interest
with Sir George in our behalf.
Surely, my dear, your agitation is
unnecessary
.
I dare
say
my
son
has never thought of the rent.
No, madam, I do not
suppose
he has, it is
so
trifling; but Mr. Villars, his
steward
,
asked
for it
last
night, and was very angry!
Indeed!
said
her
ladyship
; was he angry?
I do not mean to complain of Mr. Villars, madam,
for he has been very good to us, and often has waited
a month or two for his money. You know, madam,
he is only doing his duty when he demands it; for was
he to be
remiss
in collecting the rents, Sir George
would certainly be offended with him.
Lady Mary
smiled
at the eager manner in which
Rebecca uttered this apology for Villars; but it was a
smile
of the
utmost
satisfaction
, it convinced her of
the
goodness
of her young
visitor
's heart.
I think,
said
she
, if
some
friend could be found
who would advance this
sum
for your father.
Alas! madam, how is it to be repaid, unle,
indeed
,
hesitating
,
blushing
, and
rising
from
her
seat
.
Unless
what, my
sweet
girl?
Your
ladyship
would
generously
lend me the
money
,
and take me into your
service
, that I might
render
myself
useful
till it is repaid; or, if you think me
too
presuming
, madam, perhaps, you could recommend
me to
some
family where there are children. I am not,
it is true,
accustomed
to
servitude
, but I will exert my
poor abilities cheerfully, and hope my
willingness
to
oblige will, in
some
measure
compensate
for my
awkwardness
.
You are too good, and too lovely,
said
Lady
Mary
,
for a
servant
; but you
shall
, if you
please
, come
and live with me. I will
settle
this little difficulty of
your father's and
shall
think
myself
obliged if you
will accept a trifle annually for your pocket expences.
She then drew forth her
purse
, and
presented
the
delighted
maid with a twenty pound bank note.
Greatful beyond the power of
expression
, Rebecca
could only
sink
on her knees,
press
the hand of her
benefactress
to her lips, and,
smiling
through the tears
that
gushed
from her eyes, looked
those
thanks
she
found it
impossible
to utter.
Go, go, you are a
simple
girl I
see
, cried her
ladyship
,
raising
and
pushing
her gently from her. Go,
make your father happy, and, if you can obtain his
assent
to my
proposal
, to-morrow I will come and fetch
you home; but I
must
have you mend that little heart
of your's, it is but a very poor one to go through the
world with.
It means well, replied Rebecca, trembling and
confused
,
raising
her timid eyes to the face of her
benefactress
.
Aye, aye, I am
sure
of that, but it is too
honest
by half;
besides
, your intelligent countenance betrays
its every emotion.
I hope, madam, it will never experience any, but
may be revealed with impunity.
Ah! my dear,
said
Lady Mary,
shaking
her
head, you will, no doubt, one day find that it will
be to your
interest
to
disguise
its feelings as much as
possible
.
Rebecca, then took her leave, and as
she
returned
home, could not help thinking that it was very
strange
,
and very
inconsistent
too, that
sincerity
should
be
deemed
a virtue, and yet
disguise
be thought
necessary
to
those
who have much commerce with the world.
CHAP. III.
SUSPICION.
Well
,
Miss
, what
success
? cried Mrs.
Littleton, as Rebecca entered the room: I
hope you are convinced I was right, in
supposing
your
vanity incited you to hope without foundation.
Indeed, my dear mamma, for once you were
mistaken
:
Lady Mary has received me kindly, and more
than granted my
request
.
She then, with the
most
bewitching
simplicity
,
related
her interview at the Park, while Mr. Littleton
looked exultingly happy; but good mamma contracted
her brow, and, drawing
herself
up, as was her
custom
when any thing
displeased
her,
said
:
I hope, Mr. Littleton, you will not think of
letting
the girl go: Lady Mary certainly does not mean
to take her entirely, and it will only be filling her head
with idle notions, of which, heaven knows,
she
has
plenty already.
Besides
, what do we know of Lady
Mary? It is true,
she
came down here
last
year, and
remained about three months; but who can tell any
thing of her character and morals? She may lead the
girl into all manner of folly.
Now the
case
was exactly this: the late Sir George
Worthy had
purchased
this
estate
but a few months
before his death, and as Lady Mary was a woman of a
very retired turn, the
short
time
she
remained in the
country
she
visited
but few families, and
those
without
ceremony. Lady Mary was truly benevolent, but
she
performed
those
acts
herself
, and not unfrequently made
the
silence
and
secrecy
of the
persons
benefitted, the
only terms on which they were to hope a continuance
of her favours.
She in general
resided
at a
seat
about twenty miles
from London, to the end that
she
might
strictly
scrutinize
the conduct of a daughter who was married to a
young
dissipated
nobleman, and who, though
blessed
with a mother,
whose
example might have led her on
to every laudable
pursuit
, was
so
entirely
swallowed
up
in the vortex of folly and
dissipation
, that
she
had not
time to attend to the
essential
duties of a wife, mother,
and
mistress
of a family.
In the place where Lady Mary
usually
resided
,
she
was
considered
as a proud,
unsocial
woman, by the
midling kind of gentry; by her equals as an oddity,
and by her dependants as
something
superiorly
good,
and was by them beloved,
respected
, nay,
almost
adored as an angel of benevolence.
But Mrs. Littleton
seldom
gave people credit for
virtues which
she
had not the penetration to
discover
,
though
she
could
easily
imagine them capable of
practising
deceit, inhumanity, or
almost
any vice that can
disgrace
human nature:
she
therefore thus continued
her
discourse
to her
husband
.
People are not always what they
seem
to be; this
lady may make very fair
promises
, and when once the
girl is in her power, treat her as a common
servant
. I
beg Mr. Littleton, you will not let her go.
I am
sorry
my dear love, cried Mr. Littleton,
to differ from you in my opinion concerning Lady
Mary's offer; I think our dear girl will be highly
honoured
in her
friendship
and protection. You know
my dear if
she
should
find
herself
unhappy,
she
has a
home, however homely, where
she
will be
sure
of
being
received with
transport
. I am growing old; when
I am gone all is gone; it would be
some
comfort to
me to reflect in my
last
moments, that my dear Rebecca
was not likely to feel the pangs of want. The
small
annuity I have
purchased
for you will
supply
the
necessaries
of life to one, but not to both of you. I am as
unwilling as you can be to part with her; but it is
necessary
she
should
be in
some
way of earning a
support
,
and, I
trust
,
she
has
sense
and fortitude
sufficient
to
withstand
every temptation to evil.
Oh! my father, cried Rebecca, taking his hand,
you may, indeed, depend on a child
whose
heart
your precepts have trained in the love of virtue.
Methinks
,
should
I ever be tempted to
stray
in the paths
of vice, your
blest
image will
rise
to my imagination;
methinks I
shall
hear your
persuasive
voice
say
Rebecca
,
wilt thou break thy father's heart? Will
it be
possible
, then, for me to proceed? Oh! no;
the remembrance of you, like a
talisman
, will
shield
me from every danger.
Why, how the girl talks!
said
Mrs. Littleton:
I declare
she
learns
these
things out of the books
she
is for ever reading; for 'tis not the language of the
world; there is nobody hardly can
understand
her.
It is the language of the heart, replied the father.
Well, Sir, you are to act as you
please
; but if
any ill come of it, don't blame me; don't
say
I drove
her from home.
My dear, you talk of things which never could
enter my mind. I know you will always be happy to
have your child with you,
strange
if you were not,
so
amiable as
she
is! But as I
said
just
now, I am growing
old, I cannot remain much longer with you, and,
perhaps
you may marry again.
Marry again! Mr. Littleton, you
surely
are
trying
to vex me. Ah! my
dearest
life, when I
loose
you I
shall
loose
all my
happiness
; the
rest
of my life
will be a continued
scene
of mourning; there is a
degree
of indelicacy in a woman marrying a
second
time:
it is an
insult
to the memory of the
first
husband
, of
which I could not have believed you thought me
capable
.
It has hurt me more than I can
express
, and
she
burst
into tears.
All this now is
nonsense
,
said
the old man,
taking
hold of her hand; for my part I
see
nothing in
a woman's having two
husbands
; it is naturally to be
expected when
she
is left a lovely widow, in the prime
of life, as you are now.
No indeed papa,
said
Rebecca, innocently,
there is nothing in it at all; it is as common as can
be.
Hold your tongue,
Miss
; do not talk
so
unfeelingly
of the
loss
of your poor dear father.
God
send
, cried Rebecca, fervently
clasping
her
hands that for this many, many years, I may not
experience
so
heavy an affliction as the
loss
of my
revered
parent: it would be a heavy
stroke
to us both,
my dear mamma, but to me irreparable; for, though
you might find another
husband
, where
should
poor
Rebecca find another father? She turned away,
covered
her face with her hand, and
sobbed
aloud.
After much more altercation it was at length agreed,
that Rebecca
should
accept Lady Mary's offer, and that
Mr. Littleton
should
himself
go to the Park that
afternoon
to thank her for her bounty, and to
request
her
kindest
attention to the welfare and peace of his darling
Rebecca.
Lady Mary received him with great
politeness
, and,
after chatting
some
time with him, and
assuring
him of
her protection to his daughter,
she
thus
addressed
him:
I feel
myself
much
interested
in the
happiness
of
Rebecca, and for that
reason
, though I mean to make
her my companion, I
shall
not introduce her into
company
,
or give her a
taste
for
expensive
pleasures
. When
I have
visitors
, her meals will be
served
in her own
apartment; when I am alone, which is the
greatest
part of my time,
she
will eat and
sit
with me, reading,
working, or
amusing
herself
as inclination
shall
prompt.
I will
confess
I have an
interested
motive for this
conduct. I have a
son
, Mr. Littleton, the
last
remaining
branch of two noble families. I am
sensible
his
heart is not invulnerable, and I am fully convinced
that your daughter is the
most
lovely woman I ever
beheld; but all charming as
she
is (pardon me, Sir,
it is my duty in this point to be
sincere
) I
should
not
choose
to
see
her the wife of my
son
, and I have too
high a regard for her to
expose
her to trials to which
her fortitude may be unequal. I do not
scruple
to
say
it would hurt my pride to
see
her his wife; but it would
wound my
sensibility
to
see
her his
mistress
. My
house
at Twickenham is large; one part of it is
seldom
visited
by any body but
myself
; here I mean to order her
an apartment, and whenever I expect Sir George I
shall
request
her to keep within it: however, as he is
a very gay young man, I do not
see
him very often,
and when he does come he does not
stay
with me above
two or three hours; therefore, Mr. Littleton let
Rebecca
know this, if
she
can bear
solitude
sometimes
,
and in general retirement, I
shall
esteem
myself
happy
to have her with me. If
she
dislikes
the plan, do not
fear to inform me. I remember I was once young
myself
,
and
shall
not be at all offended if I find youth and
beauty unable to
submit
implicitly to the caprices of
age. One thing more I
must
mention: I
shall
constantly
visit
Audley Park once a year; Rebecca
shall
always accompany me, and as we
shall
be out of all
danger
at
those
times, every
amusement
that I can procure
she
may depend upon enjoying.
Mr. Littleton was a man of
sense
: he was
pleased
with Lady Mary's
frankness
, and readily conceived,
that the
proposed
retired
situation
of his child would be
the only thing to
shield
her from
those
snares
and
temptations to which a young woman is
subject
, who,
possessed
of beauty, wit, and
sensibility
, has neither
rank or fortune to recommend her to the
serious
attention
of
those
who might pretend to admire while, they
lead the
unsuspecting
innocent a victim to vice and
seduction
!
He returned home, and maugre the ill-grounded
suspicions
of his wife, the next day but one was fixed
on for the lovely Rebecca to attend her
patroness
, and
enter on an entire new
course
of life.
CHAP. V.
NOUVELLE SCENES.
Lady Mary
was not an early
riser
; Rebecca
had been
accustomed
from
earliest
infancy to
leave her bed at fix o'clock;
she
had therefore
arose
at
her
usual
hour, and finding
herself
likely to be alone
till ten o'clock, went into the library, and
selected
from among the many books there, Sir Charles
Grandison
for her morning
amusement
; the
interesting
pen
of
Richardson
had
so
entirely charmed her attention,
that
she
thought not of time till Lady Mary made her
appearance.
You have been reading, my love,
said
she
; are
you fond of Novels?
I like
these
entertaining
Histories
, madam; they
always command my attention, and awaken my
sensibility
.
It is dangerous, Rebecca, to indulge that
sensibility
too much;
besides
, my dear, you
must
not give
way to an
excess
of feeling, when the tale you read is
only a fiction.
A fiction! madam; you
surprise
me. I thought
they had been the
Histories
of
persons
who had really
existed
.
Far from it, child; human nature can never
arise
to
such
a pitch of excellence as this Sir Charles
Grandison
is
represented
to be; nor will you among your
own
sex
, be able to find a woman like
Miss
Byron:
besides
, if you
accustom
yourself
to think
these
high
wrote
scenes
real, you will find the actual occurrences
of human life
so
flat and
insipid
, that the very
disappointment
will render you
disgusted
with the world.
Rebecca
listened
with attention, but
still
in her
heart
she
thought,
surely
,
these
amiable characters,
these
interesting
scenes
, are not all fiction. I
shall
certainly
at
some
future period, meet with men and
women
as amiable as
these
are
represented
. She
nourished
this idea in
silence
, and dwelt on the delightful
vision
,
till at
last
too fatally convinced, that to be
perfect
was not compatible with mortality. She wept over
the errors of her fellow creatures, and lamented that
reasonable
beings placed in a world abounding with
every comfort,
should
ungratefully
dash
the cup of
felicity
from their lips, and eagerly drink of that which
was
strongly
tinctured with gall. It is
easily
in our
own power to be happy,
said
she
; but to render
ourselves
really
miserable
, requires much art, contrivance
and
solicitude
; for, before we can be completely
unhappy
,
we
must
forsake
the commandments of our all-wife
Creator; we
must
distrust
his merciful Providence,
and render
ourselves
totally unworthy his heavenly
protection
.
But I am
speaking
of her maturer reflexions, and
forgetting that
she
is but
just
entered on the grand
theatre of life.And to return:
The time was now nearly
elapsed
which Lady Mary
usually
spent
in
Lincolnshire
, which was two months
before and one after
Christmas
, at which period
she
enlivened the hearts of all Sir George's tenants, and
made the
smile
of tranquillity
sit
on the countenances
of age, and
softened
the couch of pain and
sickness
.
And is not this the real
incense
to be offered at
so
glorious a
season
? Will it not go up as a
sweet
smellling
sacrifice
before the
Most
High? Oh!
surely
it is
the benevolent heart will ever be acceptable to him
whose
heavenly benevolence led him to
suffer
an
ignominious
death, that we might live for ever in glory
unfading
,
in
bliss
unchangeable.
It was with infinite pain that Rebecca parted from
her father; nor did he experience
less
anguish
. God
preserve
you my child,
said
he embracing her,
remember
the
happiness
of your poor father depends on
your well doing.
Good bye, Rebecca,
said
the mother; God
bless
you, child, be careful,
circumspect
, and wary;
suspect
every one of a
design
on you till you are
convinced
of the contrary. You
must
think all men knaves,
and all women treacherous, and then you will avoid
many troubles.
Trust
no one; keep your thoughts
to
yourself
if you are unhappy, bear your
sorrows
in
silence
, for no one will pity you if you tell them; the
happy will only laugh at you, and the
miserable
have
enough to do to feel for their own afflictions. If you
are happy, be
silent
also
; for if you
boast
of your
felicity
,
some
will ridicule the
source
from whence it
follows
,
and others will, from envy, endeavour to
interrupt
that
happiness
they cannot
themselves
enjoy.
Keep your thoughts to
yourself
; have few
acquaintances
,
fewer intimates, and no
bosom
friends.
Friendship
is a pretty word, but there is no
such
thing as a
true friend
existing
in the world. Remember what I
say
; the world is full of deceit, and
silence
and
suspicion
are the only things to
secure
you from its effects.
But
suspicion
is
incompatible with
Christianity
said
Rebecca; we are taught to `judge not that we
be not judged.
Mrs. Littleton looked at her daughter with an air of
surprise
, but remained
silent
. Lady Mary
pressed
her
hand, and led her to the
chaise
. Rebecca bowed to
her parents, and before
she
was from
distance
deprived
of the
pleasure
of beholding them, the tears had
effectually
obscured
them from her view.
Their journey was
pleasant
, and the novelty of the
objects
she
encountered, in a
short
time diverted her
ideas, and before
she
arrived at Twickenham
she
was
quite tranquil and happy; nay,
she
was even more
cheerful than Lady Mary had ever
seen
her before.
It was late when they alighted; but the elegance of
the
house
, the extent of the gardens, and the
taste
in
which they were laid out, was full and
pleasurable
amusement
to Rebecca the next morning. Her own
apartment commanded a view of the Thames and its
delightful banks;
she
thought
she
should
never be weary
of
standing
at the window. I will write my father
an ample account of this charming place,
said
she
;
but when
she
had rambled over all the
pleasure
grounds,
alas! thought
she
, it will be
impossible
to give him an
adequate idea of its beauties. I
must
even
request
him
to come next
summer
, and judge of it
himself
.
For eight months,
happiness
, pure, unallayed
happiness
,
took up her abode in the
bosom
of Rebecca.
She read,
she
worked, walked, or played on her lute
alternately, as inclination led, and during that time
she
had been confined to her apartment but twice, once
when Lady
Ossiter
visited
her mother, and once when
Sir George was expected to dinner.
CHAP. VI.
WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED.
Time
now flew on the
softest
pinions with
Rebecca
;
every
rising
day brought
increase
to her
happiness
;
the
tenderness
and affection of Lady Mary hourly
increased
;
she
had
discovered
in her gentle companion
great
taste
for
music
, and a dawning of genius for
drawing.
These
are talents,
said
her
ladyship
, that ever
afford a fund of innocent
amusement
to the
possessor
,
and it is certainly my duty, by cultivating them, to
compensate
, in
some
measure
, for the cheerful
acquiescense
Rebecca
shows
to every
desire
of mine,
particularly
in
submitting
, without repining, to a
recluse
life, which
most
young
persons
, at her time of life, and
possessed
of her beauty and vivacity, would think cruel
in the extreme.
Lady Mary had received an education befitting her
rank, and had not neglected the means of improving a
very elevated
understanding
, and a bright natural
genius
,
by
refusing
attention to the ample means of
cultivation
which fortune held out; on the contrary
she
made
herself
mistress
of the fine arts,
music
and
painting
,
and to the
most
delicate and judicious choice of
the works of fancy,
she
added an
extensive
knowledge
of
history
and natural
philosophy
.
To her, therefore, the cultivation of
such
a mind as
Rebecca's was a
source
of the
most
refined
pleasure
.
She
saw
its beauties daily expand under her attentive
care, with the
same
delight as the lapidary
discovers
the
crust
that envelopes the rough diamond give way to
his labours, and the
inestimable
jewel
assuming
a degree
of brilliancy that
promises
well to reward his
industry
.
But, though the talents of Rebecca were thus
easily
drawn forth, and the
rusticity
of her manners began to
assume
a more
polished
air, it was
impossible
to alter the
simplicity
and purity of her mind. Whenever her
generous
patroness
endeavoured to give her
some
idea of
the manners of the world,
she
manifested
such
a degree
of
sweet
incredibility, when informed of vices of which
she
had no idea, and was
so
ready to frame
excuses
for
errors of which
she
imagined few could be guilty, and
none intentionally, that Lady Mary was at length
assured
that nothing but experience would convince the
innocent maid, but that every
bosom
was as free from
guilt and treachery as her own.
My dear Rebecca,
said
she
to her one day, I
will no longer labour to inform you of the vices and
follies
of mankind, the total ignorance of which
seems
to
constitute
your chief felicity. Long, my
sweet
girl,
may you retain that primitive
simplicity
of heart; it
shall
be my care to leave you at my death an
independence
,
to prevent your charming
unsuspecting
nature
from buying experience at
so
dear a rate, as an
intercourse
with, or a dependence upon, the
smiles
of an
unfeeling, misjudging world.
Thus Lady Mary determined; but, alas! like too
many others,
she
deferred, adding this codicil to her
will from day to day, till a
sudden
accident put it
intirely
out of her power.
The autumn was now advancing, and Rebecca looked
forward to the time when
she
should
revisit
her native
village. And how will my dear father be delighted,
said
she
, to
see
and hear my improvements? To be
sure
there is no
harpsichord
in his cottage; but he will
surely
come to the Park, and then I will
surprise
him
by playing
some
of his favourite airs: my mother too,
I will
request
Lady Mary to let me give her that piece
of grey
lustring
she
so
kindly brought me from town
last
week. I will buy her
also
a new cloak and bonnet,
she
will be the
gayest
of all our neighbours next
winter
;
then taking out her port folio,
she
selected
some
of her
best
drawings, and, in imagination, arranged
them round her father's little
rustic
parlour.
Lady Mary was that morning gone to
Windsor
on a
visit
to an old acquaintance, and Rebecca, having
amused
herself
in her own apartment
some
time, in the
manner already mentioned, at length took up her lute,
and opening a window which looked into a retired part
of the garden, and into which darted the mild rays of
a September's
sun
. She tuned her
instrument
, and
began
singing
the following little
song
, which
she
had
learned but a few days before; it was of
consequence
a
favourite from its novelty more than from its real beauty.
Aurora, lovely, blooming fair!
Unbar'd the
eastern
skies
;
While many a
soft
pelucid tear
Ran trickling from her eyes.
Onward
she
came with heart-felt-glee
Leading the dancing hours;
For tho'
she
wept,
she
smil
'd to
see
Her tears
refresh
the flow'rs.
Phbus, who long her charms admir'd,
With bright refulgent ray,
Came forth, and, as the maid retir'd,
He
kiss
'd her tears away.
So youth advances, mild
serene
,
Our
childish
sorrows
cease
;
While hopes, gay
sun
-
shine
, guilds the
scene
,
And all is joy and peace.
While Rebecca was
singing
,
she
had been
so
intent
on her
music
, that
she
had not
observed
any body enter
the part of the garden to which her window looked;
but on laying down her lute, and turning her eyes that
way,
she
perceived a young gentleman, in a riding
dress
, leaning
against
a tree, and gazing intently at her.
The natural
roses
that played on her cheeks were
heightened
by this
discovery
. She
arose
hastily
, and was
going to pull down the window, when the young
gentleman
advancing, with a look of the
most
earnest
supplication
:
Stay one moment, angelic creature!
said
he,
tell me if what I now behold is reality or an il
? Art thou a
spirit
of light, or the
loveliest
human
being the earth bears?
Sir! replied Rebecca, with a voice and look of
surprise
, did you
speak
to me? and
she
involuntarily
suspended
the hand that was
raised
to
shut
the window.
Oh!
speak
again, thou
fairest
of thy
sex
,
said
he,
Tell me, art thou, indeed, a mortal?
To be
sure
I am,
said
Rebecca,
smiling
; what
else
should
I be?
And
dost
thou live here?
Sometimes, replied Rebecca, with more
reserve
,
beginning to perceive the impropriety
she
was guilty of
in talking to a
stranger
.
And cannot you either
descend
into the garden, or
suffer
me to
visit
the apartment that contains
so
much
loveliness
?
I can do neither,
said
Rebecca gravely, and
she
again
raised
her hand to draw down the
sash
.
Oh!
stay
an
instant
,
said
he, and tell me, all
angel as thou art! Did thy heart ever vibrate with the
soft
emotions of love?
B
Sure,
sure
, it has!
else
I were ungrateful,
she
replied, innocently.I love my parents; I love
my lady: yes, heaven is my
witness
, how much, how
fervently, I love her! She laid her hand on her
heart, and
raised
her eyes, with a look of grateful
affection
:
Enchanting
simplicity
! but do you love
no other?
Heaven forbid! I love all mankind.
But no one in particular.
No. Her uplifted hand fell from the
sash
, and
her eyes were
cast
,
first
on the young gentleman, then
on the ground.
Could you love me,
sweetest
?
Methinks not, for you are rudely
inquisitive
.
But you will not hate me?
Hate you, Sir! No; you never did me any harm,
and if you had, I know it is my duty to forgive you,
and pray for your
happiness
.
Then you will not think of me with
indifference
?
That would be
impossible
,
said
she
, in a
softened
accent as
she
pulled down the window: but he
heard not what
she
said
, and being no longer able to
gaze on her beauties, or
listen
to her voice, he retired
from the garden in a
state
of mind by no means
enviable
.
CHAP. VII.
DEBATE ON MATRIMONY.
Sir George Worthy
was a young man of violent
passions
. At a very early age he had been made
his own
master
, and, like
most
young men of large
independent
fortune, from unlimited indulgence was led
to believe, that the
most
trifling occurrence which
thwarted his inclination, was an
insupportable
affliction
;
it was therefore a very great mortification to him
to be obliged to quit the garden in
such
a
state
of
suspence
,
especially
as he did not know who the young
lady was: however he
resolved
to
stay
at his mother's
house
a few days (a favour which he had never deigned
before
since
the death of his father) for he imagined
this fair
visitant
would of
course
make her appearance
at dinner, and that after the
first
formal introduction,
he
should
have the
superlative
satisfaction
of enjoying
her company in an
unreserved
family way.
When Lady Mary arrived,
she
was much
surprised
to
see
her
son
in the drawing-room; but as
she
had not the
remotest
idea of his having been arrived long, after the
first
salutations
were
past
,
she
went to her own
apartment
,
and
dispatched
Mrs. Harley, her woman, to
inform
Rebecca, that as
she
had company,
she
would
order her dinner to be
sent
up, and
should
not expect
to
see
her in the dining parlour.
Harley was not
satisfied
with
simply
delivering her
message
, but
also
delivered her own
sentiments
on the
subject
.
Heaven keep me from pride,
said
she
. One
must
be blind, indeed, not to perceive the
cause
of my lady's
confining you in this manner: mercy on us, as if
flesh
and blood without a title was not as good as
flesh
and
blood with one! Marry come up, and were I to be
judge, I think you are to the full as good as Sir
George, mayhap better. All is not gold that glitters.
I warrant ye, if Sir George was once to
see
your
sweet
face, he would think a title well
bestowed
.
I do not
understand
you, my good Harley,
said
Rebecca, with a look of the
utmost
simplicity
.
Oh! it is all very well,
Miss
; if you are
satisfied
I am; only I
say
it is a
shame
to
shut
you up
so
whenever Sir George comes.
Sir George! cried Rebecca, eagerly; is Sir
George Worthy at Twickenham? Yes,
Miss
Becky, he is and that is the
reason
.
Hold, Harley; my lady's commands are
sufficient
for me, without any
reason
alledged; but pray how
long has Sir George been here?
He arrived immediately on my lady's leaving
B 2
home, and
amused
himself
in the garden till a few
moments
before her return.
'Tis very well,
said
Rebecca: Your
mistress
perhaps, may want you. Mrs. Harley, pray do not
let me detain you.
Harley muttered
something
about
insensible
, and left
the room.
Lady Mary, having
adjusted
her
dress
, repaired to
the dining parlour, and
sent
the butler to inform her
son
that dinner was
served
. With a palpitating heart
Sir George obeyed the
summons
; but how great was
his
surprise
and
disappointment
, on entering the room,
to
see
no
person
there but his mother, and the cloth
laid but for two! His chagrin betrayed
itself
in his
countenance.
Do we dine by
ourselves
madam?
said
he
somewhat
confused
.
That is an odd
question
, George,
said
her
ladyship
.
I thought you was acquainted with the
recluse
life I lead, and therefore could not expect to meet
much company at my table.
Why that is true,
said
he, endeavouring at an air
of indifference; but I thought
sometimes
a
neighbour
might drop in.
He plainly perceived there was
something
of a
mystery
,
and was too much a man of the world not to veil,
as much as
possible
, the ardent
desire
he felt to
penetrate
it; he therefore partook of the
repast
provided
for his mother, and when the cloth was removed,
informed
her he intended
spending
a week or ten days
with her, previous to her departure for
Lincolushire
.
Lady Mary was rather
surprised
at this
proposal
;
but having long
wished
for an opportunity to
converse
with her
son
on a
subject
near her heart, namely, an
union that had been for many years thought of between
Lady Eleanor Harcourt, her brother's only child, and
Sir George, for whom he had
proposed
to beg the title
of Earl of Chatterton, in
reversion
, he being the only
male branch remaining of the family:
she
therefore
satisfied
herself
with
sending
an affectionate note to
Rebecca, briefly informing her of the
cause
that would
occasion
their
separation
for a few days, and
assuring
her
she
would
visit
her apartment the next morning, if
opportunity offered.
Rebecca
sighed
as
she
read the note; but
she
flattered
herself
it was a
sigh
of
pleasure
, for the
happiness
her
benefactress
would enjoy in the company of her
son
.
In the
course
of the evening Lady Mary introduced
the
subject
nearest
her heart, and endeavoured to divine
the real opinion Sir George entertained of his
cousin
's
person
, merit and
accomplishments
.
He frankly acknowledged her a very amiable woman,
a woman every way calculated to make the marriage
state
happy: But, continued he, pardon me, my
dear madam, if I
say
, I do not think
myself
, by any
means worthy the hand of
such
a woman. I am wild,
and have
seen
so
much of elegant refined beauty, that
it is no longer an object of admiration. I can look on
my
cousin
Eleanor, all lovely as
she
is, without the
least
emotion, except what proceeds from the affection
I bear her as a near and worthy relation; but this is
not the kind of affection
necessary
to form a happy
marriage. My heart has ever been unmoved by real
passionate
love, and I do verily believe, if ever it is
ensnared
, it will be by the pure charms of nature,
unadulterated
by art: I declare to you the enchanting
naivet
of unaffected innocence would be to me a
thousand
times more captivating, than all the
splendid
charms of an elegant
accomplished
woman of
fashion
.
It is
impossible
to
describe
the
astonishment
of Lady
Mary upon this unexpected declaration of her
son
; it
kept her for
some
moments
silent
.It is well,
said
she
, mentally, that I took
those
precautions in
regard to Rebecca;
she
is exactly the woman to
suit
his
taste
, and I
should
have experienced the
mortification
of
seeing
my
son
reject a title and
splendid
fortune,
and ally
himself
to
obscurity
.
Perhaps, George,
said
she
,
smiling
, you have
somewhere
met with a woman whom you think
possesses
those
captivating charms.
B 3
Oh! no,
said
he,
carelessly
; but why
should
we
talk on this
subject
now? Eleanor and
myself
are both
young enough yet. Let her
see
a little more of the
world; it is more than probable I may not be the man
of her choice.
She will never have her father's
consent
to marry
any other; nor do I think he would ever forgive a
step
of that nature; nor can I
say
, George, that I
should
easily
overlook your preferring any other woman to
Eleanor.
Upon my
soul
, my dear mother, this is a
most
ridiculous
idea! In the name of common
sense
, why are
two
persons
, who experience nothing more than
indifference
towards each other, to be chained together,
and
seal
their own
misery
, to gratify the inclinations
of
those
, who, though they have a right to our
utmost
respect
and obedience,
assume
an undue authority when
they endeavour to controul us in a point
so
very
delicate
as the choice of a companion for life. I
see
you
are offended, my dear mother; let me entreat you to
pardon my
sincerity
. Believe me, your
happiness
is
the
first
wish
of my heart, and to promote it
shall
be
the whole
study
of my life. It is to prevent you from
future pain that I
speak
thus, for, alas! what
anguish
must
seize
the heart of a parent, who, having forced a
beloved child into a loathed marriage,
sees
him
plunged
in
misery
, nay, perhaps, in guilt, from which
she
has no power to extricate him: but let us not part in
anger, continued he,
rising
, and taking his mother's
hand.
Be
assured
,
should
inclination ever prompt me to
an union with Lady Eleanor, every
transport
I
experience
will be heightened by the thought that it
increased
your felicity; but,
should
it not, let not your
displeasure
embitter the life of a
son
who loves you with the
truest
affection.
He then
kissed
her cheek, and
wished
her a good
night.
He talks
reasonably
,
said
Lady Mary, as he left
the room; but it would grieve me to
see
the family of
Harcourt
sink
to oblivion, when it is in his power to
perpetuate both its name and title.
CHAP. VIII.
FEMALE HEROISM.
Sir George
had
previously
given his valet Le Brun
an order to make inquiries obliquely concerning the
fair
recluse
, whom he had
seen
at the window in the
garden, and now retired with the eager expectation of
hearing
something
of her.
Well, Le Brun,
said
he, what news? Can you
learn whether the fair
spirit
of the garden haunts it
continually
,
or only
sometimes
?
Oh,
Monsieur
,
said
Le Brun, I did
ask
Mademoiselle
Harley. Oh!
she
be one ver pret voman;
she
never
refuse
me any thing. She be von jolie petite
fille.
Good
Monsieur
,
said
Sir George, defer the
account of your own
success
till another opportunity,
and inform me of what you have heard.
Dat be vat I vas intend, my Lor.
Mademoiselle
Harley tell me dat my Lady, your moder, keep von
ver charmante
demoisell
, to play, to read, to
sing
to
her ven
she
be alone; but ven your onor, or any
company
,
be com, my Lady do
shut
her up.
And who does Harley
say
she
is?
Oh! ma
soi
;
she
be de daughter of a pauvre old
man, who vas one
soldier
. He live in
Lincolnshire
;
de call her
Mademoiselle
Rebecca.
And does
she
constantly
occupy
those
apartments
in the
south
wing?
Ou,
Monsieur
, ou, and
she
valk every morning
in de garden by de time de
sun
be up.
This was enough for Sir George. He
dismissed
Le
Brun, and determined to
rise
by times
himself
, and
join Rebecca in the garden.
In the mean time Rebecca's thoughts were fully
B 4
employed in reflecting on the unexpected incident
which had thrown her in the way of the very man
whom it was her
interest
to
wish
to avoid. It was
unfortunate,
said
she
, very unfortunate, that I
should
have opened the window at that time; if Lady
Mary was to know I had
seen
and
conversed
with her
son
, it would make her very unhappy, and yet how
shall
I ever be able to face her after having, though
involuntarily
,
transgressed
the only
restriction
she
thought
fit to lay upon me? Will it not be
best
to watch the
moment when
she
retires to her apartment, to go to her,
candidly
confess
the accidental rencounter, and
endeavour
to deprecate the anger I
must
otherwise
expect to
encounter? Yes, it will certainly be right; my kind
generous Lady Mary
shall
never have
occasion
to
accuse
me of want of
sincerity
.
When
she
had formed this
resolution
, her thoughts
again reverted to the elegant
accomplished
manner, and
fine
person
of Sir George, again in idea
she
recalled
every
sentence
he had uttered, and innocently indulged
the
fascinating
reflexion
unsuspecting
of the
consequence
.
The clock had
just
struck
eleven when Rebecca heard
the
footstep
of Lady Mary on the
stairs
. She heard
her enter her
dressing
room, and then, with palpitating
heart,
presented
herself
at the door of the apartment,
and, by a gentle tap, demanded admittance.
Mrs. Harley opened the door; pale, trembling, her
eyes
cast
on the ground, the agitated Rebecca entered,
and
courtesying
, in a manner in which the
soul
seemed
to bow more than the body, attempted an apology for
the untimely
intrusion
.
Come in, my love,
said
Lady Mary, then
looking
at her face
she
continued, Are you not well,
Rebecca
,
or has any thing alarmed you?
Your
goodness
, Madam, overpowers me,
said
Rebecca
seating
herself
; my mind is not quite at
case
,
and, if you have a few moments to
spare
, I
should
be
glad to communicate
something
to you, without any
witness
to our
conversation
.
Harley,
said
her
ladyship
, I
shall
not go to hed
just
yet, and will ring when I want you. (Harley
retired
)
And now, my dear, what is this mighty
secret
?
taking Rebecca's hand.
I am come my
dearest
Lady,
said
she
,
rising
to
inform you, that I have, though
undesignedly
, broken
your injunctions, and incurred your
displeasure
: let me,
therefore Madam, expiate my offence, by being
banished
from this delightful place, and from your truly
valuable
society
. Send me back, Madam, to my
humble
home; but, oh! I conjure you, do not deprive me
of your
friendship
and good opinion, which I value
infinitely
more than any other earthly good.
You
surprise
me my dear child! I am at a
loss
to
comprehend your meaning. From the whole tenor of
your conduct,
since
you have been here, I am
convinced
,
that, if you have offended me, the fault was
involuntary
,
indeed. Come, come, do not look
so
grave:
I
suppose
this amazing
sault
, when revealed, will be
discovered
a very trifle. You have let my favourite
canary
out of its cage, or you have broke one of the large
India jars.
Ah! my dear Lady,
worse
, infinitely
worse
, I
have
seen
Sir George. Now, pray do not look angry;
indeed, he is the
first
and only
person
I have
seen
since
my arrival here; nor did I
seek
the interview.
Do not alarm
yourself
thus, my love,
said
Lady
Mary, obliging her to
sit
down again. Come,
compose
your
spirits
, and tell me
sincerely
how it happened,
what
passed
between you, and what you think of my
son
?
Oh! I think him,
said
Rebecca, the
most
engaging
young man I ever
saw
; he has
such
a manly
look, yet
such
a
soft
air and voice.
Indeed!
said
her
Ladyship
, gravely, and pray
what might he
say
to you?
Ah! Madam, it would be vanity in me to repeat
all he
said
, he
spoke
so
many fine things.
It is well Rebecca, I
see
you
still
retain that
candour
and
sincerity
for which I ever loved you. I am
fully
satisfied
that this interview was not
sought
on your
side
, nor can I
suppose
it was on his. You
seem
to
entertain
B 5
a very favourable idea of Sir George, and I
make no doubt but he does the
same
of you; but do
not from this indulge any vain hopes that you can ever
be any thing to each other. Young men of a certain
rank in life, do not frequently match
themselves
with
their inferiors, yet they will leave no art
unessayed
to
awaken
sensibility
in the heart of every woman whom
they affect to admire. Will you make me one
promise
,
Rebecca, and, without
reserve
, ever remember to keep
it inviolate.
Dear Madam, do you, can you, doubt me?
Speak your commands; I am
sure
they will not be
severe
,
and when I
disobey
you, from that moment may
peace and joy be
strangers
to my
bosom
.
Then
promise
me, my dear, that you will never,
directly, nor indirectly,
listen
to any overtures of love
which Sir George may make, or give him the
least
encouragement
;
and while you keep the
promise
sacred
,
may every earthly
happiness
surround
you; and
should
you ever feel inclined to break it, reflect it is the only
thing which you can do to wound the peace of a woman
who loves you as her own child.
Then hear me, Madam,
said
Rebecca, while
I
solemnly
protest
, that never, while I retain my
senses
,
will I
listen
to any
profession
of love whatever from your
son
. The grateful affection I bear towards your
Ladyship
will prompt me to keep this vow inviolable, had
I no other motive; but, my dear Lady, I have two
powerful
reasons
for never infringing it. The
first
, I
trust
you will believe, is an invincible repugnance
inherent
in my
bosom
to every thing derogatory to the
dignity and honour of my
sex
, and which will urge me
to treat with
scorn
every overture that tended to the
injury of either:And for the other, pardon me,
Madam
,
I feel my inferiority, nay, feel it
so
powerfully,
that I will never meanly creep into a family who would
think
themselves
dishonoured
by the alliance.
My dear good girl,
said
Lady Mary, embracing
her, I honour you for this
spirited
reply. You
would not
dishonour
any family; but I never was a
friend to unequal matches; they are
seldom
productive
of much felicity;
besides
, my
son
is the
destined
husband
of another.
Rebecca heard her in
silence
,
sighed
, and was
preparing
to leave the apartment. Stay, my love,
said
Lady Mary, though you have charmed me by
the
frankness
and candour of your behaviour, I am not
satisfied
, but that George will attempt to
see
you again;
shall
I
request
my dear girl will keep intirely in her
apartment to-morrow, and avoid going to the windows,
and in the evening a
chaise
shall
be ordered to the back
garden gate. My own man James
shall
attend you,
and you may proceed one
stage
on your journey towards
Lincolnshire
that night. James will take particular
care of you, and
see
you
safe
at your father's
house
,
where you can pay them a
short
visit
till I join you,
which will be in about three weeks time. She then
put a heavy
purse
into her hand, bade her
consider
it
as her own, and then
wished
her a good night: but
calling her back, as
she
was about to leave the room,
she
desired
her to be careful what
she
said
to Harley,
and in particular to avoid mentioning her intended
journey.
Is it pride?
said
Rebecca, as
she
retired to
rest
:
Or is it a tender
wish
for my felicity, that actuates
Lady Mary? Surely it is the latter. Her liberality,
her
condescending
affection, all tend to convince me
it is my
happiness
alone
she
is
studious
to
preserve
:
and never
shall
it be
said
that Rebecca Littleton, like
the ungrateful viper,
stung
the friendly
bosom
that
warmed her into life; for,
surely
, the cultivation of
our mental faculties, the enlargement of our ideas, is
a
second
, nay a better life than what we receive from
nature, and this life I have received from my revered
benefactress
. What delightful
sources
of
pleasurable
amusement
has
she
opened to my view! How
inestimable
the benefits I have received from her hand! Then
her thoughts reverting to Sir George,
she
continued,
Surely the
son
of
such
a mother
must
be all that is
good and amiable, and it is not infringing my vow to
love him as a brother. Ah! how happy will be the
partner he
shall
choose
, nay, that he has
chosen
; for
did not his mother
say
his
destiny
was fixed? May their
felicity be as
lasting
as their lives! May every earthly
blessing
crown them! May heaven
shower
down its
bounties on their heads, that their joys may render
completely happy the heart of my kind, my generous
Lady Mary!
Then lifting up her
soul
, in its nightly
address
, to
the Throne of Grace,
she
blended the name of Sir
George with that of his mother, and
sunk
into that
peaceful kind of
slumber
, which only innocence, like
her's, can enjoy.
CHAP. IX.
MORTALITY.
Small
was the
rest
Sir George enjoyed that
night, and
soon
as the morning peeped into his
chamber he left his bed, and repaired to the part of the
garden where Le Brun had informed him Rebecca
usually
walked; but vain was this early attention, vain
the anxious expectation in which he waited, the
goddess
of his morning adoration did not make her
appearance
,
nay, even
so
scrupulous
was
she
of her Lady's
injunctions, that
she
kept the window
shutters
closed
on
the
side
next the garden, and only opened one that
looked on a
grass
plot that faced Lady Mary's
apartment
.
Till near nine o'clock Sir George walked in the
hope of
seeing
Rebecca; but finding
those
hopes
frustrated
,
he returned, highly
disappointed
, to his
apartment
,
and prepared to meet his mother at
breakfast
.
She has not been out, Le Brun,
said
he, as his
valet was tying his hair: I have walked three hours
for nothing.
Oh!
Monsieur
vill have bon
stomache
to his
dejeunner
.
Damn the
breakfast
,
said
Sir George, What
could keep the lovely girl from walking as
usual
this
morning?
She be no awake yet,
said
Le Brun.
Mademoiselle
Harley tell me
she
no ring her bell yet.
Then Harley attends her?
She vant ver lit attendance;
she
be von amiable.
But Harley
answers
her bell?
Ou,
Monsieur
, ou, no oder go to her chamber.
Sir George
started
from his
seat
, wrote a few
hasty
lines, and bidding Le Brun give them to Harley with
five guineas,
desired
they might be delivered into the
hands of Rebecca.
When Harley attended our heroine at
breakfast
,
she
laid the letter on the table.
And what is this, Mrs. Harley?
said
she
, taking
it up.
A letter,
Miss
, which I was
desired
to deliver into
your hands.
From whom does it come?
A
sweet
rich gentleman, my dear young Lady,
who, having once
seen
you,
wishes
again to enjoy that
satisfaction
.
From Sir George Worthy?
Harley
courtseyed
assent
.
Well then, my good Harley, take it to your
Lady
,
desire
her to read it, and dictate the
answer
she
would
wish
me to
send
; or
stay
, I will
enclose
it in a
blank cover, and do you deliver it to the
person
who
intrusted
it to your care.
Why,
surely
,
said
Harley,
surely
,
Miss
Becky,
you do not reflect on what you are doing! Sir George
is a man of fortune, a
handsome
, agreeable man.
His beauty to me, Mrs. Harley, would be his
least
recommendation:
besides
, I hope ever to make
it an invariable rule of my conduct to receive no letters
from men, without the
sanction
of
those
who are better
judges of what is proper than I can be: but, as it
will be
needless
to trouble my Lady with this, give me
that
sheet
of paper from the writing
desk
.
Harley gave her the paper;
she
folded up the letter,
sealed
it, and gave it to her.
But you have not directed it,
Miss
.
There is no
necessity
for directing it. Do you
deliver
it to the
person
who gave it to your care.
Ah!
Miss
, I think you will repent, for Le Brun
tells me Sir George loves you to
distraction
. He has
been walking in the garden
these
three hours in hopes
of meeting with you.
I am
vastly
obliged to him,
said
Rebecca,
smiling
,
while her cheeks
assumed
a deeper glow, and her
eyes a brighter
lustre
.
But you do not pity him, though his heart is
almost
breaking!
I do pity him, Harley, indeed, I do; and if he
were poorer, and I were richer.
Ah!
Miss
, Love levels all
distinctions
. Sir George
would think
himself
the
person
obliged. He told Le
Brun you were the only woman he ever thought on with
partiality.
Mrs. Harley,
said
Rebecca, opening a drawer
of a
small
cabinet, do me the favour to accept
these
few yards of lace; I never had an opportunity before
of giving you
some
small
token of my gratitude for
your kind attention to me
since
I have been in this
family
.
But, good Mrs. Harley, you
must
never talk to
me in this manner again. I beg you will not tell me
any thing that Le Brun
says
; I have no
desire
that
isit is not properI
must
not
listen
to
such
discourse
.
Harley,
simpering
, withdrew, and the innocent
Rebecca little imagined
she
had betrayed a
secret
which
she
ought to have guarded with the
utmost
care; nay,
she
even did not think that her heart was the
least
interested
in Sir George's welfare, any
otherwise
than, as
the
son
of her
benefactress
, it was her duty to rejoice
in his felicity.
The remainder of the day Rebecca
spent
in
arranging
her clothes, &c. for her journey; nor did
she
forget
,
among her
musick
, to put the new
song
, It is
certainly extremely pretty, and
she
sung
it to
herself
all the day.
Towards evening Lady Mary rang for Harley.
Harley,
said
she
, I think you have a brother
at
Windsor
. I have ordered a
chaise
for
Miss
Littleton
to take a ride this evening, therefore, if you like, you
may go with her. Be
sat
down at your brother's and
stay
all night. I will call for you to-morrow as I take
an airing.
Harley, who little
suspected
the
scheme
that was in
agitation, readily embraced this opportunity of
visiting
her brother. She looked about for Le Brun, to inform
him of her intended
absence
; but Lady Mary had taken
care to
send
him out of the way.
Her
Ladyship
took a very affectionate leave of
Rebecca
,
told her James had received every
necessary
order
,
and again thanked her for the integrity of heart
she
had
so
nobly
shown
in having no concealments from
her, and
promised
her that her
friendship
, for
herself
and family,
should
be
manifested
, even after her death.
She then returned to the drawing room, and kept Sir
George engaged in
conversation
till
she
imagined
Rebecca
was departed.
Sir George, though mortified by the return of his
letter unopened, yet conceived great hopes from the
account Harley gave him of their
conversation
, and
determined
to watch carefully for an opportunity to
see
and
personally
plead his own
cause
to his fair
enslaver
;
but he
cautiously
concealed
these
thoughts from his
mother
,
whom he was far from imagining was, at that
very moment, counteracting all his
schemes
.
In the mean time Rebecca continued her journey,
and by noon, on the
second
day of her departure,
she
found
herself
drawing very near her father's cottage.
Ah!
said
she
, how
surprised
and delighted will
the dear old gentleman be to
see
me arrive
so
unexpectedly
;
nay, I think, even my mother will rejoice to
see
her child after
so
long an
absence
: then, in idea,
she
ran over all
she
had to relate to them. And how
my father will applaud my conduct!
said
she
,
exultingly
.
Surely there can be no
pleasure
in this world
equal to the
applause
of a parent whom we love, and
whom it has ever been our
study
to obey.
The
chaise
drew up to the door. She looked towards
the parlour window; no one appeared. I am afraid
they are not at home,
said
she
; but
casting
her eyes
up to the chamber,
she
saw
the window curtains
close
drawn. At that
instant
Ruth, their faithful
servant
,
appeared at the door.
Oh! dear
Miss
,
said
Ruth, in a tone of
sorrow
,
I did not think you could have come
so
soon
.
What is the matter? cried Rebecca,
springing
from the
chaise
, and
seizing
the hand of Ruth, in
breathless
agitation.
Your poor father!
said
the
servant
.
Oh, God! my father is dead!
No, my dear
Miss
, not dead; but veryvery ill.
Merciful heaven! cried Rebecca,
sinking
on her
knees, with
uplisted
hands and
streaming
eyes,
restore
him to my prayers, or let me not live to know
his
loss
.
The
transition
was
so
great, from
pleasure
to
extreme
sorrow
, that
she
could no longer
support
it, but
fainted in the arms of Ruth.
On her recovery
she
found her mother by her
side
.
She threw her arms round her neck, wept audibly on
her
bosom
, but could not
speak
.
Ah! child, you may well cry,
said
Mrs.
Littleton
,
for your father is not expected to live one hour
after another.
Then lead me to him, dear mother; lead me to
him, that I may receive his
blessing
, and catch his
last
figh. Ah! he
must
not die without a parting embrace
to his Rebecca.
Mrs. Littleton made no reply, but proceeded
slowly
up the
stairs
. Rebecca followed, and in a moment
found
herself
by the bed-
side
of her
almost
expiring
father. He put forth his hand;
she
pressed
it to her
lips, and
sunk
in
speechless
agony on her knees.
Do not lament thus, my dear child!
said
he
faintly: Heaven's will be done. I
trust
you have
found a protector in Lady Mary, and I
shall
go
satistisfied
with that comfortable reflexion.
Protector! indeed, cried Mrs. Littleton,
peevisnly
;
heavy was the day when
she
left her home for
the protection of
strangers
! I am
sure
you have never
been well
since
. This
illness
is all her fault. You
have done nothing but pine and mope about, and if
any thing happens it will all lay at her door; but
she
was
so
eager
forsooth
to go, any where rather than home,
she
was tired of the company of her old father and
mother
.
Do not, my dear love,
said
Mr. Littleton, do
not embitter my
last
moments by laying on the mind
of this poor girl more than
she
can bear. Behold her
anguish
, and pity it. Do not attribute my
illness
to
so
wrong a
cause
. My frame has long been decaying: I
felt it
myself
, though I forbore to afflict your
bosom
by
mentioning my
apprehension
.
Oh! my father, cried Rebecca; I hope you
will recover. I hope.
Do not deceive
yourself
, my dear; my
disorder
is
a decay of nature, and a
slow
nervous fever, which the
physician
informed me
yesterday
it was
impossible
to
remove. I then
desired
your mother to
send
for you;
but tell me, my child, how is it
possible
you can have
arrived
so
soon
?
Alas! replied Rebecca, I did not know you
were ill till I arrived at the door. I came by my
Lady's
desire
to
spend
a few weeks with you and my
mother
before
she
comes into the country.
You have not offended her, Rebecca?
said
the
father.
No indeed,
said
she
, exultingly; I am higher
in her
esteem
than ever.
Ah!
so
she
may tell you, cried Mrs. Littleton;
but I will
answer
for it
she
was tired of your
company
,
or
she
would never have
sent
you away before her;
so
there is an end of your fine hopes,
Miss
Becky.
It was with the
utmost
uneasiness
that Rebecca
beheld
her mother thus prejudiced
against
her. She
endeavoured
to recollect if any inadvertant
expression
, in
any of her letters, had given her
cause
of offence; and,
in hopes to conciliate her good humour,
she
, in the
evening, opened her trunk, and
presented
her mother
with the
silk
before-mentioned.
She received it
sullenly
, and laying it down,
without
scarce
deigning to look at it,
said
, This is no
time to think of fine clothes, child, though in my
heart I believe your thoughts never run on any thing
else
but
dress
, and
fashion
, and
nonsense
.
The truth was, that if Rebecca had a foible it was
a
passion
for
fashionable
dress
; but this was never
carried
to an extreme, and, though remarkably attentive
to the decoration of her
person
,
she
was never fine or
tawdry.
This ill-timed reproach of her mother's filled her
eyes with tears, and
she
retired to bed, but not to
rest
,
her father's
illness
, and the
distance
she
then was from
her
benefactress
, were
such
painful reflexions, that
sleep
was a
stranger
to her eyes till the morning began
to dawn, when
she
enjoyed a few hours of
composed
slumber
.
Mr. Littleton's
disorder
daily
increased
. He found
his end nearly approaching, and frequently
recommended
to his daughter to
preserve
, after his death, the
same
dutiful
respect
for her mother
she
had ever
manifested
.
To Mrs. Littleton he did not fail to recommend a
tenderness
of behaviour, that might tend to invite the
confidence of Rebecca. You are too
harsh
with the
poor girl, he would
say
; treat her kindly: I am
sure
you will find her
deserving
of it.
I know her better than you do, was the
constant
reply, and I know
she
is an artful,
designing
girl.
Mr. Littleton could not believe any evil of his
favourite
,
and died in her arms on the fifth day after her
arrival,
blessing
her with his
last
breath.
CHAP. X.
DISAPPOINTMENT.
Sir George
had not really determined in his own
mind whether he would
address
Rebecca on an
honourable
score
, or merely endeavour to gain her
affections
,
and then act as he
should
find, from her manner
and
dispositiou
,
she
deserved
.
That day and the next he waited patiently in the
hope of
seeing
her; but on the third, when Harley
returned, (for Lady Mary did not bring her home till
that time) how great was his
surprise
and
disappointment
to hear that Rebecca had been
sent
for into the
country to a relation that was ill; for Mrs. Littleton's
letter arriving the day following Rebecca's departure,
it
served
as a
sufficient
apology for her
absence
, though
indeed, Lady Mary did not think proper to enter into
explanations with her woman, and rather
misled
her,
by mentioning
Bristol
as the place where Rebecca's
sick
friend was.
Though Sir George had
previously
informed his
mother
that he thought of accompanying her into
Lincolnshire
,
he no
sooner
heard that the object of his
pursuit
had taken a different route than he determined
to
pursue
her.
I have thought better of it,
said
he to her
Ladyship
;
I
shall
not
visit
my tenants this year, for I
have
several
engagements in town which I cannot well
get off:
besides
, I had forgot that I had
promised
a
friend of mine to accompany him to Bath.
Ah! cried Lady Mary, exultingly to
herself
, my
good George, your journey will be in vain.
In a few days Sir George left Twickenham, and
immediately
set
out with
post
horses
for
Bristol
, where
both
himself
and Le Brun were extremely diligent in
their inquiries, though the reader may
easily
imagine
to how little effect: however, he
still
continued, and
nourished
the hope, that chance would, by
some
means
or other,
discover
to him the
residence
of the fair
Rebecca
,
for as he could not
suppose
the
situation
of her
friend very
splendid
, he thought it
needless
to inquire
for her among people of
fashion
; but he
desired
his valet
to be very minute in examining every
house
where they
let lodgings.
Three weeks had now
elapsed
since
Rebecca's
departure
,
and Lady Mary was preparing to
visit
Lincolnshire
,
when, as
she
was
conversing
with her
daughter
,
Lady
Ossiter
, one morning,
she
was
suddenly
seized
with a fainting fit, which was
succeeded
by
several
others, and left her
so
weak and low, that the
faculty called in thought her life in imminent danger.
Alarmed at this intelligence,
she
desired
Harley to
write immediately for Rebecca to return, and, calling
for pen and ink, determined no longer to delay making
the poor girl independent; but when
she
took the pen
and attempted to write, her
faintness
returned, and
she
was totally unable to execute her
purpose
; but
resolved
to do
something
for her,
she
called Lady
Ossiter
to her,
and thus
addressed
her:
There is a young woman, of the name of Littleton,
who has been with me
some
months, though now
she
is in the country. She is of a
sweet
disposition
, and
it was my intention to leave her at my death a
thousand
pounds. I
request
you, my child, to pay her this
sum
,
as
soon
as you conveniently can, after my
decease
, and
also
give her my watch, a
small
picture
set
with pearls,
and this ring, taking one from her finger. I hope
she
will arrive time enough to be informed from my own
mouth of my intentions in her favour; but
should
she
not, I
trust
, you will not be neglectful of the
desire
of a dying mother.
It was with great difficulty, and many interruptions,
that Lady Mary made known to her daughter this her
request
. Lady
Ossiter
promised
obedience; but, alas!
Lady
Ossiter
seldom
remembered her
promise
, however
sacredly
given. It was
impossible
to give Sir George
notice of his mother's danger, for no one knew where
he was.
Lady Mary continued tolerably
composed
all that
night; but the next day her fits returned, and
she
expired in the evening.
When Rebecca received the news of her
benefactress
's
illness
she
flew to Audley Park. James was
still
there.
Your Lady is very ill, James,
said
she
; I
must
set
off immediately for Twickenham.
And I will attend you,
Miss
,
said
James, eagerly.
Only
say
when you will like to
set
off, and I will
order the
chaise
.
I will go the moment you can procure one,
said
she
. I thought you would go with me, James, and,
indeed, I
should
be afraid to take
such
a journey by
myself
; but do not order a
horse
, my good James;
we
shall
travel
faster
if you ride in the
chaise
with me.
I could not bear to have you hurrying after me on
horseback
.
James had lived with Lady Mary from the day of
her marriage. He had
served
his
mistress
with the
truest
fidelity, and the tears
gushed
from his aged eyes when
he heard of her danger.
When Mrs. Littleton
sound
Rebecca was determined
to obey Harley's
summons
,
she
conceived it was a high,
an unpardonable breach of filial duty, for her to think
of leaving a mother in
so
early a
state
of widowhood.
You give me a great proof of your affection,
Miss
,
cried
she
,
scornfully
, to leave me in
so
much affliction,
and fly
post
haste
after
strangers
: however, we
shall
see
who is
most
worthy your attentions by and bye. I
suppose
, when my Lady is tired of you again, you
will be glad enough then to return to your mother.
Though Rebecca was greatly hurt by
these
unjust
reproaches, it did not prevent her intended journey,
and
she
set
off that evening attended by James, and,
indeed, in her own mind, firmly
resolved
, that nothing
but
absolute
necessity
should
ever oblige her again to
visit
Lincolnshire
, except it was in the company of
Lady
Mary.
It was late in the evening when
she
arrived at
Twickenham
.
The
sad
countenance of the
domestic
who
opened the door, led her
presaging
heart to fear the
worst
.
Harley met her in the hall,
pressed
her hand in
silence
,
and proceeded to light her to her
usual
apartment.
Rebecca hardly dared breathe as
she
went up
stairs
;
as
she
past
her Lady's
dressing
-room,
she
stopped
,
looked
earnestly
at Harley, and, laying her hand on
her heart, cried:
Tell me the truth: but her
respiration
became
so
difficult
she
could not
finish
the
sentence
.
All is over,
said
Harley.
I feared
so
, cried Rebecca; then turning into
her own room,
she
sunk
on the bed in a
state
of
stupid
insensibility
, from whence it was difficult to
rouse
her.
Harley
used
her
utmost
endeavours, and at length
succeeded
. Rebecca
raised
her
clasped
hands to heaven,
exclaimed, Thy will be done, and the
salutary
drops of
sorrow
gushed
in a torrent from her eyes!
Harley was
pleased
to
see
them flow, and imagining to
leave her to the free indulgence of them would be
best
,
retired to inform Lady
Ossiter
(who had not yet left
Twickenham) that Rebecca was arrived.
I will
see
her in the morning,
said
her
Ladyship
,
carelessly
. Take her with you, Harley, to the
house
-keeper's room.
She is in her own apartment, Madam. She never
associated
with even the upper
servants
.
Oh!
she
is quite the fine Lady I
suppose
. How
could you endure the creature's pride, Harley?
I never
discovered
that
she
had any, Madam. She
is the
meekest
being in
existence
.
My mother
used
to
say
she
was
handsome
, cried
her
Ladyship
, looking in the
glass
.
I believe every one thought her
so
who looked at
her. Sir George was greatly
struck
with her, though
he
saw
her but once.
Well,
so
much the better; I
suppose
he will take
the trouble of providing for her off my hands; eh,
Harley, don't you think
so
?
Indeed, Madam, I have often thought
Miss
Littleton
would one day be Lady Worthy.
Woman!
said
Lady
Ossiter
, turning
hastily
round,
with a look of the
utmost
contempt, how could
such
an idea enter your mind? Lady Worthy, indeed! No,
I think George knows better than that; he may,
perhaps
,
make her his
mistress
: but go, good woman, go,
you have made me quite
sick
by the horrid
suggestion
.
Poor Rebecca,
said
Harley,
softly
, as
she
left
her imperious Lady: Poor girl, you will
see
a
sad
change I fear. You have
lost
your
best
friend, and
so
we have all, indeed; for though my late dear Lady
was proud
she
never wanted humanity.
CHAP. XI.
TEARS OF SENSIBILITY AND SORROW A-LA-MODE.
When
the mind of Rebecca became a little
composed
,
Harley prevailed on her to take
some
refreshment
. She took a few mouthfuls of boiled
chicken
and drank a
glass
of wine, and then inquired in
which room the remains of her revered
benefactress
lay.
In her own
dressing
-room as yet,
said
Harley;
but to-morrow
she
will be removed.
Rebecca
said
but little more, and Harley thinking
the fatigue of her journey, and the agitation of her
mind combined, might incline her to go early to
rest
,
removed the
supper
table, and
wished
her a good night.
No
sooner
was Rebecca alone than
she
gave way to a
fresh
burst
of grief; the
loss
of her father was again
renewed, the
unkindness
of her mother was
remembered
with double
anguish
, and her own
friendless
situation
struck
so
forcibly on her mind, that her
sorrow
became
almost
insupportable
. At length her tears
seemed
exhausted
; a kind of torpid calm
succeeded
, and
she
formed the
resolution
of
visiting
the chamber that
contained
the
deceased
Lady Mary.
With
hasty
and unequal
step
she
reached the door of
the apartment, opened it
softly
, and
paused
for a
moment
to
summon
all her fortitude.The attendants in
the adjoining room heard her enter, and approached to
console
her; but
she
waved her hand in
silence
for them
to retire, and they
respected
her too much to attempt
an
intrusion
on her grief, but left her to the free
indulgence
of it.She placed the candle
she
held in her hand
on a table and approached the coffin, gazed, with
reverential
awe on that countenance, which had often
beamed on her looks of the
kindest
benevolence.
Dear and only friend,
said
she
,
since
thou art
gone, where is there a heart remaining that feels one
spark
of affection for the poor Rebecea? Oh my more
than mother, thy adopted child is now
berest
of every
earthly comfort! Spirit of purity, look down from the
mansions
of felicity, and hear the vows I here repeat:
never
to infringe one command of your's while life warms
my heart. While you lived it was my pride, my glory, to
deserve
the affection with which you honoured me, and
if
shall
be
still
my
study
to
preserve
, to the
latest
hour
of my life, my integrity
unshaken
; though you can no
longer be
sensible
of my
respect
and love,
sacred
shall
be your memory to my heart, that heart which,
whilst
it retains your precepts, can never
stray
from the path
of rectitude, never be unworthy of the regard of all
who love virtue.Here her feelings overpowered her;
her head
sunk
on her handher tears again
burst
forth
her lips continued to movebut articulation was
denied
.At
this
instant
the door opened, and Sir
George entered. He
started
involuntarily at beholding
Rebecca. Her
pensive
attitude, her
depressed
countenance
plainly depicted the
sorrows
of her heart; the
afflicted maid had not heard his approach. He drew
near, and laid his hand on one of her's. She
raised
her
timid eyes, looked at him mournfully, pointed to the
coffin, and cried, emphatically:
She is gone for ever!
Sir George really loved and
respected
his mother; nor
had he heard of her
illness
when the public prints
announced
her
decease
. Shocked beyond
measure
, he
instantly
took
post
horses
, and never
stopped
, even for
necessary
refreshment
, till he alighted at his mother's
gate,
saint
and fatigued. He
asked
if his
sister
was
there, and being informed
she
was in the drawing-room,
he went
hastily
up
stairs
; but how was he
disgnsted
,
upon entering the room, to
see
the unfeeling daughter
of
so
good a mother receive him with the
greatest
sang
froid
.
She
arose
,
presented
her cheek, was glad to
see
him,
slightly
mentioned the melancholy event, and
soon
after
asked
him if he intended ordering a mourning coach,
or only to put his
servants
in black? I think,
continued
she
, the mournings are much
shorter
than they
used
to be, and nothing near
so
deep: I am glad of
it; for my own part I
detest
mourning, it makes one
look
so
dirty and
dismal
.
Just
then Lord
Ossiter
entered, and
proposed
a game
at cards, by way of whiling away the evening.
Ah! do join us, George,
said
her
Ladyship
;
I have been moped to death this week
past
.
I am not in a humour for
amusement
,
sister
,
said
Sir George, coldly; and
since
you have no feeling
yourself
of the irreparable
loss
we have
sustained
, I
shall
not trouble you with mine, but retire where I may
indulge
them uninterrupted.
How great
must
be the
contrast
then between this
unfeeling
sister
and the affecting
sensibility
of Rebecca!
He
pressed
her
passive
hand in
silence
, mingled his tears
with her's, and found his heart
insensibly
relieved.
My poor mother,
said
he, after a
pause
of a few
moments, little did I think when we parted it was
the
last
time!
She is undoubtedly happy,
said
Rebecca, in
some
measure
, forgetting her own
sorrow
, and
wishing
to convey
consolation
into the
bosom
of Sir George.
Oh! I know
she
is, replied Sir George; if
the practice of every virtue can
insure
eternal felicity,
she
is happy beyond what our weak imaginations can
paint.
Rebecca's tears
streamed
afresh
.Ah! my dear
mother,
said
he, your loved remains are embalmed
by the tears of grateful affection, though thy daughter,
forgetful of thy worth, can
amuse
herself
with trifles,
and neglect the tribute due to thy memory.
Ah!
said
Rebecca, I never can forget her
never
wish
it; for the remembrance of her virtues will
emulate me in the attempt to imitate them.
She
pressed
her lips to
those
of her clay cold
benefactress
,
faintly and
tremulously
pronounced the word
farewell! and
rushed
hastily
out of the apartment.
The next morning, at twelve o'clock Harley
summoned
her to attend Lady
Ossiter
.
On entering the
dressing
room,
she
found her
Ladyship
deeply engaged with her mantua-maker and
milliner
.
She did not even notice the entrance of Rebecca;
but thus continued her directions to the former of her
tradeswomen
:
C
Let them be made as elegant and as full as
possible
;
but, at the
same
time, remember, I
wish
to pay
every
necessary
respect
to my dear mother. It was a
very
sudden
thing. Mrs. Modily, you cannot think
how it
shocked
me; my nerves will not be
settled
again
this fortnight, I dare
say
; then, a thing of this
kind forces one to be mewed up, and
see
no company,
so
I thought I might as well
stay
where I was as go to
town. But, as I was
saying
, Modily, let my white
bombazine be made very
handsome
, and full trimmed
with crape: I do not mean to keep from
visiting
above
a fortnight, and, I think, in a month or
six
weeks I
may wear white
muslin
, with black crape ornaments,
for
undress
.
The accommodating mantua-maker agreed to all the
Lady
said
, when, turning round to
speak
to her
milliner
,
Lady
Ossiter
was
struck
by the elegant
person
,
and
modest
humble countenance of Rebecca.
Oh! I
suppose
,
said
she
,
carelessly
, you are
the young woman my poor mother mentioned in her
last
moments?
Rebecca
courtseyed
assent
, but was unable to
speak
.
Ah!
she
was very good to you, I
he">she
was very good to you, I
,
don't make
yourself
uneasy
, I will be you friend
in future.
Rebecca attempted to
express
her thanks; but her
emotions
were
so
violent,
she
was forced to continue
silent
.
I dare
say
, child,
said
her
Ladyship
, you have
some
taste
in
dress
; come, give me your opinion about
the caps I have ordered. Here, La Blond,
show
her
those
caps: well now, what do you think, will
these
be deep enough? for, though I hate mourning, I
would not be wanting in
respect
; one's friends are apt
enough to
say
ill-natured things; one can't be too
cautious
in giving them
occasion
. Do you think I
should
go without powder? You look
monstrous
well without
powder; but then you have light hair, and your black
dress
, though
so
very plain, is becoming. Who are
you in mourning for, child?
Rebecca was
struck
almost
speechless
with
astonishment
.
Good heavens!
said
she
, mentally, can this
be the daughter of Lady Worthy?
Who are you in mourning for, child?
said
Lady
Ossiter
.
My father, Madam.
Oh! you have
lost
your father. Well, it can't
be helped, old folks
must
be expected to drop off. You
must
not be low
spirited
if you are with me: I hate
low
spirited
people, though
since
I
lost
my poor
mother
I have been low enough
myself
; but I endeavour
to
shake
it off as much as I can; it is of no manner of
use
to grieve; when folks are once dead, we can't
recal
them, though we fretted
ourselves
blind.
But we cannot always command our feelings,
Madam
,
said
Rebecca.
No, child, that is true. I am
sure
I often
wish
my feelings were not
so
delicate as they are; it is a
great affliction to have too much
sensibility
. Pray
what is your name, my dear?
Rebecca.
Rebecca, that's a queer old
fashion
name. I
remember
when my mother
used
to make me read the
great Family Bible, I remember then reading about a
Rebecca Somebody; but, Lord! child, 'tis a
vast
vulgar name; I'd alter it if I was you; one never
hears of
such
a name among people of any
resinement
.
I am
sorry
it does not
please
your
Ladyship
,
said
Rebecca,
almost
smiling
at her
absurdity
; but as I
was
christened
by it I
must
be
satisfied
with it.
Well, then, Rebecca, but what is your other
name?
Littleton, Madam.
Ah, Lord! they are both three
syllables
that is
so
tiresome
. Well, but, Rebecca (for I like the name
best
on account of its oddity)
should
you have any
objection
to enter into my
service
?
Far from it, Madam; I
shall
cheerfully
serve
any
part of the family of my dear departed Lady?
Ah! but I am not quite
so
sentimental
as my
mother
was: I
shall
not want any body to work and read
by me. I
shall
want you to be
useful
; now for
instance
,
C 2
to make up my morning caps, to trim my
muslin
dresses
.
Can you
speak
French, child?
Yes, Madam, and
shall
be happy to render
myself
useful
in any thing within the
compass
of my power.
I do not
wish
to eat the bread of
idleness
.
Rebecca
spoke
with a degree of
spirit
that
surprised
Lady
Ossiter
: however,
she
unabashed
, proceeded:
I have two little boys and a girl; I really have not
time to attend them: now I could
wish
you to hear
them read, give them
some
little knowledge of the
French, and take care of
Miss
Ossiter
's clothes. Can
you make frocks?
I make no doubt but I can, if I try, and my
utmost
endeavours
shall
not be wanting.
That is well. I
understand
my mother did not
suffer
you to eat with the
servants
,
so
you
shall
have
your meals in the
nursery
with the children. I
suppose
,
if my woman
should
happen to be ill, or out of the way,
you would have no objection to
dress
or
undress
me.
I am afraid I
should
be awkward, Madam; but
if you will pardon my want of experience, you
shall
always find me ready to obey your commands.
And what wages do you expect?
Whatever you
please
.
What did my mother give you?
I had no
settled
salary
.
Well, but I like to know what I am about; I'll
give you
sixteen
guineas a year.
Rebecca agreed to the terms, and, retiring to her
apartment, left Lady
Ossiter
to
finish
her
consultation
with her milliner and mantua-makerwhile
she
took up
her pen, and informed her mother that
she
had entered
into a new line of life, in which
she
hoped to be enabled
to do her duty, and gain the approbation of her Lady.
CHAP. XII.
THE MAN OF THE WORLD.
During
the time that intervened between the
death of Lady Mary and her interment, Sir
George, though he frequently thought of Rebecca,
made no attempt to
see
her, but
satisfied
himself
with
sending
every day to inquire after her health.
It is certainly a very improper time,
said
he, to
think of entertaining her on the
subject
of love. Her
heart is at
present
over charged with
sorrow
;
besides
I
should
prove
myself
highly unworthy of her
esteem
,
could I, at this melancholy period, think
seriously
on
any thing but the mournful
cause
of our meeting.
The morning after the
last
solemn
ceremony was
performed, Sir George,
sitting
at
breakfast
with his
brother and
sister
, mentioned that, in
respect
to his
mother's memory, he
should
remain at Twickenham a
couple of months, and
see
no company, but one or
two
select
friends: he then invited Lord and Lady
Ossiter
to remain with him during that period, and
proposed
sending
immediately for the children.
You'll pardon me, brother,
said
her
Ladyship
;
I cannot think of remaining any longer in this
melancholy
place than till to-morrow, and I
must
say
you
are much to blame, in
resolving
to bury
yourself
from
the world: I am
sure
it is a
step
which cannot be
expected
from
so
young a man.
You are to act as you
please
,
sister
, and, I hope,
you will permit me to do the
same
.
Oh!
apropos
, you know the young woman,
Rebecca
what's
her name? I never can remember it.
She that my mother kept with her as a kind of
companion
.
I have
seen
her,
said
Sir George, and cannot
say
but I am
surprised
my mother made no mention of
her in her will; but, I
suppose
,
she
desired
you to
make
some
provision
for her.
Yes,
she
did mention her to me, and I have taken
her into my protection.
Here Lord
Ossiter
, who had been
carelessly
looking
over the news-paper, laid it down.
So then,
said
he, with an air of
curiosity
, your
Ladyship
has taken her as a companion; but, pray,
if that is the
case
, why is
she
not at the
breakfast
table,
to
save
you the trouble of making the tea?
Oh! you labour under a
vast
mistake
, my Lord;
C 3
no humble toad-eater will ever make a part of my
household
.
I
assure
you, I
detest
the whole
class
of them;
they are in general a
set
of forward, impertinent
creatures
,
made up of pride and
idleness
: I keep nobody
about me but can render
themselves
useful
; and I know
of no
use
your cringing companions are but to
criticise
their Lady's actions, and contribute to their Lord's
amusement
.
His
Lordship
looked
disappointed
, and
reassumed
the news-paper.
Sir George was perfectly
astonished
at his
sister
's
illbred
expressions
; but willing to know in what manner
Rebecca was provided for,
simply
asked
the
question
.
Why, I have taken her into the
nursery
to teach
the children to read.
I approve the plan
vastly
,
said
Lord
Ossiter
,
again laying down the paper: I think the children
wanted a
governess
.
Not
so
fast
, my Lord: I have as great a
dislike
to
governesses
as to companions. I hate the whole
class
of your
second
-hand gentry. Rebecca will hear them
read
dress
and
undress
Miss
Ossiter
make her frocks
and upon
occasion
,
assist
my woman.
Sir George felt his cheeks glow with indignation.
I think,
sister
,
said
he,
considering
the place
she
held in our mother's
esteem
, the
situation
you mean to
give her is not paying that dear woman's memory a
proper
respect
;
besides
, I do not think it probable,
after having been treated as the companion of Lady
Mary,
Miss
Littleton will feel
herself
satisfied
with
being only the
servant
of her daughter.
Don't make
yourself
uneasy
about that, George;
I have talked with her, and agreed about terms;
however
,
if you
choose
to retain her here as
house
-keeper
extraordinary, attempting an arch look,
To cheer the
solitary
days of mourning, added
his
Lordship
.
Sir George darted at them both a look of the
utmost
contempt. Your inuendos,
said
he, are as cruel
as they are
groundless
: however, Lady
Ossiter
, you
will
please
to know, that no
person
, who has been
honoured
by the
friendship
of my mother,
shall
be treated
with
disrespect
, when I have the power to prevent it.
If
Miss
Littleton is not
satisfied
with her
situation
, I
shall
think it my duty to place her above it.
I will
send
for her here, and you may
ask
her,
said
her
Ladyship
.
Aye, that is the
best
way,
said
Lord
Ossiter
,
ringing the bell; for from Sir George's evident
agitation
,
he imagined there
must
be
something
extraordinary
about Rebecca, and
earnestly
wished
to
see
her.
Tell Rebecca I want her,
said
the Lady to the
servant
who entered the room.
For heaven's
sake
, Lady
Ossiter
,
said
Sir George,
do not
shock
the poor girl's feelings, by
sending
for
her here.
Oh! Lord,
she
must
get the better of
those
feelings
you talk about, or
she
will never be good for
much;
besides
, it always diverts me to
see
her
blush
,
and look like a fool.
Rebecca Littleton can never look like a fool,
Madam
,
cried Sir George, with vehemence, and
since
you
persist
in
sending
for her, you will
excuse
me if I
do not
stay
to
see
Lady
Ossiter
render
herself
ridiculous,
by
insulting
a woman every way her
superior
, but in
the paltry
distinction
of fortune.
He then left the room,
shutting
the door after him
with violence, and in a few moments Rebecca entered.
How great was the
surprise
of Lord
Ossiter
when he
beheld the
strikingly
beautiful figure that
presented
itself
to his view!
Modesty
had recalled to her cheeks
the
rosy
hue which grief had chaced from them. Her
fine eyes were timidly
raised
from the ground to her
Lady's face, while, with a gentle inclination of the
body, and a voice of
softest
harmony,
she
requested
to
know her commands.
Nothing particular, child; only I was montioning
to my brother the
situation
I had offered you in my
family, and he thinks you will not be
satisfied
with it.
Indeed, Madam, I am greatly obliged to Sir
George for his
solicitude
, but
must
request
your
Ladyship
to inform him that while I can be
so
fortunate as
C 4
to obtain your approbation, I
shall
never be
otherwise
than happy, and
shall
deem
myself
highly honoured by
your protection as long as your
Ladyship
shall
think
fit to extend it towards me.
Perhaps you would like to tell him
so
yourself
,
child?
By no means, Madam.
But you are quite
satisfied
, Rebecca?
Intirely
so
, my Lady, and that
satisfaction
will
ever remain uninterrupted, while I am
conscious
of
performing my duty.
Well, that's all, cried her
Ladyship
, in a half
peevish
accent.
Rebecca
courtseyed
, and retired.
Well, and what do you think of her, my Lord,
cried the Lady, turning to her
husband
; why you
seem
in amaze!
I am perfectly
so
, my dear (endeavouring to
recollect
himself
;) but it is
because
I can't, for my
soul
,
conceive what George can
see
in this girl to make
such
a
fuss
about her.
Why, don't you think her
handsome
?
No woman appears
so
in my eyes when your
Ladyship
is by.
Oh! you're
vastly
civil this morning; but, pray
what fault have you to find with her
person
?
Nay, nothing particular; but I think
she
is
altogether
insipid
.
She is very fair.
Yes, but I was never
struck
with your very fair
women; they have not half the
expression
of your fine
brunettes.
Lady
Ossiter
was a very dark woman, and could not
help at that moment going to the
glass
to
adjust
her
handkerchief.
She has very fine eyes, my Lord.
Fine eyes, oh! ridiculous; you may as well
admire
the blue
glass
beads
stuck
in the head of a wax
doll. I don't
see
any thing about her even tolerably
pretty but her neck and
shoulders
; they
seem
shaped
well enough.
This horrid mourning makes one look like a fright,
cried the Lady,
still
looking in the
glass
, and they
have made my gown
so
abominably high, I declare I
appear quite round
shouldered
; it
shall
positively
be
altered before I wear it again.
Not if I might
advise
, my dear; for I declare I
never
saw
you look better than you do this morning;
and, in my opinion, women inclined to
em bon point
have more dignity in their
persons
than the very
slender
;
for
instance
, now your Rebecca;
she
will always
remind me of Death and Daphne.
Dear, my Lord, when have I
seen
you in
so
agreeable
a humour? I declare you are quite witty.
How can I be
otherwise
, my Lady, when I have
so
good a
subject
for ridicule?
Her
Ladyship
did not take the
keenness
of the
sarcasm
,
and retired, to give
some
orders to her woman,
perfectly
satisfied
that Rebecca was infinitely inferior to
herself
in
personal
attractions; while her artful
husband
applauded
himself
for the part he had acted, which he
naturally imagined would
secure
, within the reach of
his power, a woman
whose
charms had made
such
an
impression
on his mind, that he was
resolved
, if
possible
,
to
sacrifice
her a victim to
seduction
.
CHAP. XIII.
THE WOMAN OF HONOUR.
When
Sir George left the parlour, he retired to
his own apartment, and calling for pen and ink,
addressed
the following letter to Rebecca:
TO MISS LITTLETON.
With a heart fully
sensible
of the merit of the object
I
presume
to
address
, how is it
possible
but I
must
also
be
sensible
of the fear of offending her? pardon me,
dear young Lady, if
almost
unacquainted with the
C 5
thousand
little delicacies expected by your
sex
from
those
of ours, who venture to offer their
friendship
and
assistance
to innocence and beauty; pardon me, I
say
,
if my
expressions
are not
sufficiently
denotive of my
respect
and
esteem
, while I venture to
ask
if the
situation
my
sister
offers you is perfectly
consonant
with your
expectations and
wishes
; yet I ought to know the
modesty
,
the humility of your mind, will lead you to tell
me it is.
But, alas! I too well know the
disposition
of
Lady
Ossiter
to imagine a heart, like your's, replete
with
sensibility
, can enjoy any tolerable degree of
tranquillity
,
when
subject
to her caprice and ill humour: I
must
therefore entreat my lovely friend to accept not
from me, but as a legacy from my mother (for I am
sensible
she
designed
it, though the
sudden
stroke
that
deprived us of her prevented her putting her
designs
in
execution) the
enclosed
two
thousand
pounds, which
will, at
least
, place you above dependance on the weak
and unworthy.
Permit me
also
to
assure
you, dear amiable
Miss
Littleton, that, in every future period of my life, I
shall
be happy to convince you how much I am
interested
in your welfare, and that nothing would give me more
sincere
pleasure
, than being allowed to devote my life
and fortune to the promotion of your felicity.
I am, with every token of
esteem
and
respect
,
your friend,
GEORGE WORTHY.
Rebecca could not read this letter without emotion;
yet did
she
not
hesitate
what
answer
to return; the
letter
itself
she
carefully locked up in her cabinet, but
the bank-bills
she
sealed
up in the following note:
TO SIR GEORGE WORTHY.
Rebecca Littleton returns her
most
grateful
acknowledgments
to Sir George Worthy for the kind
solicitude
he evinces for her
happiness
. She begs leave
to return his noble
present
, which
she
cannot think of
accepting, as it would lay her under an obligation too
oppressive
to a
spirit
which Sir George is
mistaken
in
thinking humble. Rebecca feels
herself
highly
satisfied
in the protection of Lady
Ossiter
, and, though
she
feels grateful for the offered
friendship
of the
son
of her ever-lamented
benefactress
,
she
must
beg leave
to decline it, as the
vast
distance
fortune has placed
between
them renders it
impossible
to cultivate true
friendship
,
which can only
subsist
between
persons
on an
equality with each other. Rebecca
wishes
to be
retained
in the memory of Sir George only as the
servant
of his
sister
, and, at the
same
time,
assures
him, the
son
of Lady Mary Worthy will ever be retained in her
mind with
servent
wishes
for his
happiness
.
When
she
had
sent
away this note,
she
again read
over Sir George's letter; a tear,
almost
unknown to
herself
, fell on it as
she
perused
with attention his offers
of
friendship
: but
she
soon
recollected
herself
,
hastily
brushed
away the token of her
weakness
, and,
returning
the letter to her cabinet, began to prepare for her
removal to town, whither Lady
Ossiter
intended
returning
the next day.
CHAP. XIV.
TRIAL OF THE HEART.
What
a noble mind is here
displayed
!
said
Sir George, as he read Rebecca's note.
How much does this woman's
sentiments
elevate her
above the
station
in which Providence has placed her!
I fear my letter was not dictated with
sufficient
delicacy;
her pride has taken the alarm, that laudible pride that
is a woman's
best
safeguard
: but no matter, I will not
write again, but wait till I can
discover
in what
manner
my
sister
behaves to her. When
she
has tried her
new
situation
,
she
may not find it
so
easy
as her little
knowledge of the world at
present
leads her to imagine.
When
she
finds
herself
uncomfortable, then, perhaps,
the offer of
friendship
from me will be more acceptable.
In the evening Sir George, having no inclination to
join the
insipid
chat of Lord and Lady
Ossiter
, pleaded
letters to write, and went to the library to look for a
book that might afford him an hour's rational
amusement
.
As he entered the room, he
saw
Rebecca
busily
employed in retouching a
small
drawing that lay before
her, and he
observed
, that
she
frequently looked at a
portrait of his mother that hung over the chimney.
I
disturb
you, I fear,
Miss
Littleton.
By no means, Sir, cried Rebecca,
rising
,
visibly
embarrassed
; I was
just
going. Indeed, my being
here is an
intrusion
, I
must
entreat you to pardon.
I
shall
be extremely
sorry
if
Miss
Littleton
considered
herself
as an intruder in any apartment in this
house
. You were drawing; will you permit me to
see
your performance?
You will
smile
at my
presumption
, Sir; but I have
been endeavouring to catch
some
faint
resemblance
of
my regretted Lady, that
should
any thing
separate
me
from her daughter's
service
, I might have it in my
power
sometimes
to gaze on her beloved features and
weep.
You have been happy in
preserving
the
likeness
;
but, I think, I have a miniature of my mother, the
most
striking
thing of the kind I ever
saw
.
He then drew from his pocket a
small
case
, which
contained Lady Mary's picture, elegantly
set
with
brilliants, intermixed with pearls. It had been
set
as
a
present
for Lady
Ossiter
; but as that Lady knew
not of her brother's
design
, he thought he might now
dispose
of it more to his own
satisfaction
.
Will
Miss
Littleton honour me
so
far,
said
he,
taking it from the
case
, as to wear this picture for
the
sake
of her
whose
resemblance
it bears?
The picture of
itself
, Sir George, would be to me
an invaluable treature; but its ornaments are
so
superb
and
costly
, you will pardon me if I decline the
acceptance
of it.
Why will you mortify me by this
refusal
? You
treat me very unkindly,
Miss
Littleton,
since
even my
mother's picture is not acceptable from my hands!
Indeed, Sir, you are
mistaken
, and, to convince
you I am not ungrateful, was that picture
devisted
of
its rich ornaments, I would accept it cheerfully, and
wear it, not only for her
sake
, but your own.
Charming, engaging woman! exclaimed he,
catching
her hand, why are you thus
irresistibly
lovely,
and yet
refuse
me the
satisfaction
of placing you above
the malice of fortune?
She
blushed
carnation deep, as
she
attempted to
withdraw
her hand; but a
smile
dimpled on her cheek, and
her heart peeped forth from her tell-tale eyes.
You make me
smile
,
said
she
, to hear you talk
of the malice of fortune. We, who are born in an
humble
station
, cannot feel the want of luxuries which
we never enjoyed.
Happiness
is not always annexed to
wealth, or
misery
to poverty. We are all poor or rich
by
comparison
, and my
situation
, which to you is an
object of
compassion
, would be to
thousands
the
summit
of felicity; but your
condescension
makes me
forget
myself
: I
wish
you a good night.
Stay one moment adorable Rebecca, cried Sir
George,
stopping
her as
she
was about to leave the
room. Hear me, I entreat you, with attention; by
heavens, you
shall
never go into the
service
of Lady
Ossiter
, nor into any
service
. I am your
slave
; my
life, my forune, all are your's. I love you more than
existence
itself
. I mean not to offend your delicacy.
My
designs
are of the
most
honourable nature. Name
your own time, I will wait with patience. Only
suffer
me to tell my
sister
, that the woman whom I
aspire
to
the honour of making my wife,
must
henceforth be
treated with that
respect
her worth and virtue demands.
Hold, hold, dear Sir George, cried Rebecca,
pale and trembling, I
must
hear no more. You
honour
me, highly honour me by
these
professions
of
regard
;
but you talk of
impossibilities
. The humble
Rebecca Littleton, however
sensible
of your merits,
can never be your wife;
insurmountable
obstacles
are
placed between us.
If your
bosom
, lovely Rebecca, glows with
sensibility
,
every
obstacle
is
easily
removed.
Do not interrupt me,
said
she
. The
obstacles
I
speak
of can never be removed; my vows are already
pledged; they are
registered
in heaven; 'tis
sacrilege
to
listen
to your declaration.
Sir George dropped her hand, and, with a look of
mingled horror and
surprise
, cried, Are you already
married?
No, replied
she
, faintly, not married.
Then you
sport
with my
misery
, cruel, cruel girl!
Alas!
said
Rebecca, with a look of
tenderness
,
heaven knows I do not. I would give worlds, did
I
possess
them, to
save
you from one hour's
anguish
;
but, ah! Sir George, mine is a wayward fate; my
bosom
is heavy laden with
sorrow
. Ah! do not
increase
that
sorrow
by letting me
see
you partake it.
Then, cried he,
starting
from his
seat
, then
you do not hate me?
Hate you, oh! no, that were
impossible
.
Then we may yet be happy,
said
he, catching
her in his arms.
Rebecca's heart had
almost
betrayed her; but
she
was
sensible
this
must
be the moment of victory. She
pushed
him from her, and
assuming
an air of
reserve
,
Sir George,
said
she
, if you
wish
my
happiness
,
there is but one way by which you can promote it, that
is, by never more
speaking
to me on this
subject
; my
fate is irrevocably fixed;
cease
then to
disturb
my
felicity
by endeavouring to awaken my
sensibility
. You,
Sir George, are
designed
by heaven to move in an
exalted
station
. You have many duties to fulfil, which
it will be
almost
criminal to neglect. For me,
unknowing
and unknown by the world, if I can but
pass
through life
blameless
, my
utmost
wish
is gratified.
Will you then leave me?
said
he, and leave me
devoid of hope?
No, Sir, I will endeavour to cheer your
bosom
with the
same
hope that animates mine. I hope,
sincerely
,
you will
soon
meet a woman your equal, in
birth, fortune, and merit, who will obliterate from
your mind all traces of Rebecca; and may you, united
by the
most
sacred
ties, enjoy in her
society
every
blessing
that heaven can
bestow
, or you
desire
.
No, Rebecca, no; do not indulge
so
vain an idea,
for while you live, and remain unmarried, never
shall
the hymenial torch be lighted by me.
Ah! cried Rebecca, forcing a
smile
, you talk
wildly; we
shall
hear you tell a different tale
shortly
.
But will you not accept the picture as a token of
my
esteem
?
He held it towards her. She put his hand back,
and
said
, in a tone of
displeasure
, I can accept no
diamonds, Sir George, and, for heaven's
sake
, detain
me no longer here. I have acted very improperly in
talking with you
so
long; but I will take care this
shall
be our
last
interview.
She then
courtseyed
slightly
, and retired to her
apartment
,
where
conscious
rectitude alone alleviated
the pangs of
disappointed
love.
Yes,
said
she
, I have done right; an union
with Sir George would by no means
secure
me
permanent
felicity; he is young, volatile, and
possessed
of
violent
passions
. Alas! when the novelty of my
person
was worn off, I might
cease
to charm, and how could
I endure his neglect?
besides
, how ill could my heart
bear that he
should
be
subject
to the
sneers
of his
acquaintance
on my account. Oh! my dear Lady Mary,
you knew what was
best
for me, and never will I
forget
your injunctions.
CHAP. XV.
SERVITUDE.
And
pray, what do think of my Lady?
said
Mrs.
Lappett to Rebecca, the evening of her arrival
in Bedford-Square.
Lappett was an experienced Abigail. She had lived
with Lady
Ossiter
from the time of her marriage, and
had
not, without envy, beheld Rebecca introduced
into the family, as
she
feared
she
might have a gown or
two the
less
in a year, or, perhaps, Rebecca might
supplant
her intirely. This
jealousy
made her
resolve
to cultivate an intimacy with the
unsuspecting
girl, and
be the
most
forward in
showing
her civilities, that
she
might win her confidence, draw from her her real
opinion
concerning her Lady, and then betray her.
Lappett
,
when
she
had any favourite point to gain, could
assume
a
most
insinuating
manner. The words that fell
from her tongue were
smooth
, and
pleasant
as the
river's
surface
unruffled by a breeze: but like that, when
the whirlwind of
passion
arose
,
displayed
the
most
frightful
contrast
.
And what do you think of my Lady?
said
she
,
as
she
was taking her tea in Rebecca's apartment.
I hardly know what to think yet, replied
Rebecca
.
I never judge very
hastily
. She appears
extremely
good natured.
Ah! my dear, you will know her better by and
bye; there is a deal of difference between old
servants
and new ones.
I
should
be much obliged to you, Mrs. Lappett
to give me
some
little idea of the
best
method to obtain
her approbation.
Indeed, that is more than is in my power, child,
for what
pleases
to-day may
displease
to-morrow: I
never give
myself
much trouble about it. How do you
like the children?
They are very fine boys; but I am
most
pleased
with
Miss
Ossiter
;
she
seems
extremely mild and
engaging
.
Well, you are the
first
person
I ever heard
say
they liked her
best
. My lady can't bear her;
she
says
she
is
so
stupid
.
I think it is very wrong,
said
Rebecca, in the
simplicity
of her heart, for mothers to make any
distinction
in their regard for their children; and I
shall
consider
myself
doubly obliged to be kind and
affectionate
to
Miss
, if her mamma is unkind to her.
It
shows
the
goodness
of your heart, my dear
ma'am,
said
Lappett, beginning to
see
a little into
the
disposition
of our heroine. But, pray, have you
seen
my Lord yet?
Yes, once at Twickenham.
Well, don't you think him a
vast
handsome
man?
He is well enough,
said
Rebecca,
carelessly
;
but Sir George Worthy is, in my opinion, a great
deal
handsomer
.
Lord
Ossiter
is a man of gallantry, though, I
assure
you, I
must
tell you, but it is between
ourselves
, he
once made
proposals
to me.
Indeed! Well, I think, you were right to
refuse
him;
disproportionate
marriages are
seldom
happy.
Oh! Lord, my dear, it was not for marriage, I
assure
you; it was
since
I lived with my Lady.
Good heaven! cried Rebecca, with a look of
surprise
, what
since
he has been married?
Yes; but I would not have you mention it; he
offered me three hundred a year.
And how could you remain in the family after
such
an affront, Mrs. Lappett?
Why, I thought it was a pity to
lose
my place,
so
I kept my gentleman at a proper
distance
, and he
dropped the
pursuit
: but come, ma'am, let us hurry
the
nursery
maid to put
Miss
Ossiter
and the young
gentlemen to bed, and then we will go down and take
a game at cards in the
housekeeper
's room.
You will
excuse
me, Mrs. Lappett: I never played
a game at cards in my life;
besides
, my Lady has
given me
some
muslin
to
spot
, and I
must
set
about it.
Lord! child, you'll have enough to do if you
humour
her by working of an evening.
It is my duty to do all that is in my power, and
I had rather work than
sit
still
.
Well, then, bring down your work, you will be
moped to death
sitting
here by
yourself
.
Oh! dear, no, I
shall
not: I am never lonely.
I work very
fast
, and when I have done a good bit I
can take up a book and read. I would rather not go
down, if you will
excuse
me.
Just
as you
please
, ma'am,
said
Lappett; we
shall
be glad of your company, but if you prefer being
alone .
She
courtseyed
, ironically
tossed
her head, and left
Rebecca to the enjoyment of her own reflexions, while
she
entertained her fellow
servants
with the pride,
conceit
,
and ignorance of the new comer. I tried to get
her down
amongst
us, that we might have a little fun
with her,
said
she
, for you would laugh to hear
how
foolishly
she
talks. She will not
stay
here long,
take my word for it.
At
least
Mrs. Lappett had
resolved
, in her own mind,
to
use
every exertion to
displace
Rebecca from a family
where,
she
was fearful, her beauty, innocence and worth,
would attract the notice of one,
whose
devoirs
she
considered
as entirely due to
herself
.
For, to own the truth, Mrs. Lappett had not been
quite
so
deaf to the
proposals
of her Lord as
she
had
represented
to Rebecca, though
she
rather made a
mistake
in
saying
his
Lordship
had offered a
settlement
,
that being a
measure
earnestly
desired
by
herself
, but
which
she
could find no means to bring Lord
Ossiter
into: indeed, he had found her too
easy
a
conquesty
to
indulge a thought of putting
himself
to much expence
or trouble on her account.
The next morning, when Lady
Ossiter
had
breakfasted
,
she
went immediately to the
nursery
, a thing
she
had not been known to do for many months before;
but Rebecca was a novelty, and therefore demanded
from her Lady
some
little attention; as Rebecca had
been told that her Lady
seldom
, if ever, came into the
children's apartment, the
visit
was intirely unexpected,
and Lady
Ossiter
, found her
busily
employed in
arranging
some
pencils and crayons in a
small
, but elegant,
drawing box, which had been given her by her late
benefactress
.
She
arose
, and apologized for the
confusion
her
drawings, &c. which had fallen on the floor, had made
in the apartment; had I known your
Ladyship
intended
this honour,
Oh! never mind, child, cried the Lady, with
a look of infinite good humour, which no woman knew
better how to
assume
than Lady
Ossiter
; I did not
come to
disturb
you, but I thought I
should
like you
to hear the children read.
Have they ever been taught their letters, Madam?
Why, upon my word, I cannot tell: I believe
Charles can tell them when he
sees
them: I have tried
him
sometimes
by taking up the news-paper when he
was in the room; but I do not believe Lucy or James
know any thing about it; but call them in, and let us
see
what they can do.
Rebecca, who had about two hours before
seen
them
all neatly
dressed
, and given them their
breakfast
,
opened
the adjoining room to call them, when how great
was her
surprise
when
she
saw
the
eldest
boy, who was
eight years old, with two or three colour-
shells
before
him,
several
brushes
, and a
bason
of water, with which
he had not been
satisfied
to daub
several
sheets
of paper,
and his own clothes, but
also
his brother and
sister
's
hands, faces, and frocks! Infinitely chagrined that
they
should
be
seen
by their mother in
such
a condition,
she
turned mildly towards the
nursery
maid, and
asked
how
she
could be
so
neglectful as not to mind what
the children were doing?
Mind them
yourself
, ma'am, was the
answer
:
I thought you came here to help me, not to
command
me.
I
shall
for the future mind them,
said
Rebecca,
attempting to take the
brushes
from
Master
Ossiter
.
You
shall
not have them,
screamed
he: I will
paint when I
please
; mamma
says
I
shall
.
Rebecca
persisted
in removing from his reach the
shells
and water, when
setting
up a
scream
like a
bed-lamite
,
he threw one, which he had retained in his
hand, full in her face!
What is the matter? cried Lady
Ossiter
,
opening
the door. Come hither, Charles; what do they
do to you, my love?
She will not let me play. She has taken away my
paints, and will not let me do any thing.
But
she
shall
let you do as you
please
,
said
the
mother,
kissing
him,
so
do not cry.
At that moment another
scream
, from the inner
apartment
,
vibrated in her
Ladyship
's ears, and
Master
James and
Miss
Ossiter
came bellowing into the room,
that the new maid would
wash
their faces.
Heaven
save
me,
said
the Lady, from often
visiting
the
nursery
! You are enough to drive one mad.
I had hoped, indeed, that you, Rebecca, would have
managed them better than to have had all this uproar;
but I
see
servants
are all alike; they have no more
notion
of the management of children than natural fools:
why, I will
answer
for it, if I had time, I could make
these
children do
just
as I
please
, without any of this
roaring. Do not you think, Charles, you would
always
mind me?
Oh! yes, mamma; you never contradict me,
but give me every thing I want.
Well, go, my dear, go to Rebecca and have your
face
washed
, and you
shall
go out in the coach, and buy
some
more paints. Do, child, put James and
Miss
Ossiter
on clean frocks, and get
yourself
ready to go
out with them. I will hear them read another time;
poor dears, they have been vexed enough this
morning
:
then taking her favourite's hand, to lead him
out of the room,
she
stopped
, and picked up two or
three of Rebecca's drawings.Here, my love,
said
she
,
ask
your maid to give you
these
pretty pictures.
Rebecca was too meek to contradict, and he
marched
off with her two
best
performances in his hand.
In about ten minutes a footman tapped at the door,
to inform Rebecca that the chariot waited, and that
she
must
go to her Lady's
dressing
-room for
Master
Ossiter
.
Rebecca, who had been
accustomed
to peace and
regularity, was
distracted
by the hurry and
confusion
she
had been thrown into; but flattering
herself
it
would be better next day,
she
made all the
haste
she
could, and repaired to the
dressing
-room, where, on a
sofa
,
beside
his mamma,
sat
the delectable
Master
Ossiter
,
with a pair of gold-bowed
scissars
, cutting the
houses
, trees, and figures, from her drawings, which
her
Ladyship
was
amusing
herself
by placing in a kind
of
fantastic
medley on the table before her.
See, Rebecca, cried
she
, we have
dispatched
these
pretty pictures, I dare
say
, a deal quicker than
you made them.
Rebecca
smiled
faintly; but
she
felt a cold chill
strike
to her heart. Alas! Lady Mary would not have
done
so
,
sighed
she
,
softly
, as
she
followed the children
down
stairs
, and a tear
started
in her eye, which
she
was unable to
suppress
.
Drive to the toy-
shop
,
said
Master
Ossiter
, as
the man
shut
the chariot-door, and
see
what mamma
has given me, continued he, pulling half a guinea
from his pocket, and
showing
it to his brother and
sister
:
and I am to lay it out
just
as I
please
.
As the chariot
stopped
at the
shop
door, a poor man,
pale and emaciated, with but one leg, took off his hat,
bowed, but did not
speak
.
Look at that poor man, my dear,
said
Rebecca;
he would be very thankful for a
small
part of your
money;
suppose
you was to give him a
shilling
?
What
should
I give him a
shilling
for?
said
the
child.
Because
he is in great
distress
;
see
how pale he
looks, and what a thin ragged coat he has on this cold
day!
Well, what is that to me?
Suppose
,
Master
Ossiter
, you were cold and
hungry
?
That you know is
impossible
.
Impossible
! Sir.
Yes, to be
sure
; a'nt I a Lord's
son
, and
shall
not I be a Lord
myself
, if I live long enough? and,
you know, Lords are never poor.
Then is it the more their duty to relieve
those
that are.
Duty!
said
he,
staring
in her face; mamma
never gives any thing to poor folks;
she
says
they
should
be all
sent
to
prison
, and made work.
This dialogue had
passed
in the
shop
, and the
miserable
subject
of it
still
was at the door.
Miss
Ossiter
put her little hand
instinctively
into her pocket.
If I had any money; but mamma don't very often
give me any. Then approaching Rebecca, in a kind
of half
whisper
, If you, ma'am, will give the poor
man half a crown, I will
ask
my uncle for one to pay
you with the
first
time I
see
him.
Rebecca gazed on the child as
she
was
speaking
, and
she
fancied
she
beheld her grandmother's benevolence
play about her infant countenance.She caught her
in her arms, gave the
desired
half crown, and joy for
a moment animated her
bosom
, when
she
beheld both
the beggar and his little
benefactress
look equally
happy
.
CHAP. XVI.
MODERN MANNERS.
A Few days after this Lady
Ossiter
sent
for
Rebecca
,
in
haste
, to her
dressing
-room. You
seem
to have
some
taste
for drawing child,
said
she
,
pray can you paint flowers.
A little, madam.
Well, now I want you to do
something
for me;
I
last
night
saw
the
most
beautiful painted trimming,
and I'll take you to a
shop
this morning where you
shall
see
some
like it; if you think you can do it, I
shall
be
vastly
pleased
, for there is a ball next week.
But your
ladyship
is in mourning,
said
Rebecca,
blushing
for her lady's folly.
Oh, la! well, I
protest
I forgot that, but now,
I dare
say
you could fancy me
something
pretty in
black and white; do try child: I
shall
change my
mourning in about a month, and I think you can do
it in that time.
If I knew what would
please
your
Ladyship
.
Do it according to your own
taste
, Rebecca, and
I am
sure
it will be pretty.
The good natured Rebecca was willing to
please
to
the
utmost
of her power, but, alas, that power was far
from adequate to the many
tasks
imposed
upon her.
Mrs. Lappett was a great favourite, therefore often
asked
leave to go out, and then Rebecca was
summoned
to attend the toilette of her lady, and indeed her
taste
and judgment in the arrangement of female ornaments
was
so
elegant, that Lady
Ossiter
never appeared to
greater advantage than when
dressed
by her hands.
Then was a morning cap to be made, or a
dress
fresh
trimmed, they were all brought to Rebecca; and did
her
Ladyship
ever
ask
for any thing that was not ready,
the
answer
was, indeed, my Lady, I gave it to
Rebecca
,
two or three days ago, but
she
is
such
a fine
lady, and
spends
so
much time at her book and her
music
.
In the mean time our fair heroine was
sacrificing
her
health to the vain hope of obtaining the approbation
of her lady,
she
had not a moment for the
most
trifling
relaxation; obliged to
rise
early, on account of the
children, for the very
nursery
maid
imposed
upon her
good nature, and left her entirely to
dress
and
undress
them. Mrs. Lappett would, if in the
least
indisposed
,
retire to
rest
, and leave Rebecca to
sit
up for her lady,
who was addicted to the
fashionable
vice of gaming,
and often was from home till four, five, nay
sometimes
fix o'clock in the morning; and when
she
had ill luck,
would return in the
most
diabolical humour, and vent
that
spleen
which
politeness
obliged her to conceal in
company, on her meek unoffending attendant; indeed
to
such
height did
she
often
suffer
her
passion
to
rise
,
that Rebecca, on hearing the knocker announce her
arrival, would fall into
such
a fit of trembling, that
she
was
scarcely
able to
stand
, while
she
undressed
her.
But the reader
must
not
suppose
that, during this
period
,
either Sir George or Lord
Ossiter
had forgot her; the
former had written her
several
letters, which
she
returned
unopened; for,
said
she
,
conscious
as I am of my
own
weakness
, why
should
I wilfully
expose
it to trials
it may not be able to
withstand
. At length, wearied
out with her inflexible
resolution
, he determined to
take a trip to the continent, and endeavour to
banish
her from his thoughts; but before he went, he
determined
at
least
to put it in her power to leave his
sister
whenever her
situation
became painful, without being
obliged to have
recourse
to
servitude
again. And Mrs.
Harley was the
person
he determined to employ on this
occasion
.
Lord
Ossiter
had made frequent attempts to
see
and
converse
with Rebecca, but
she
was
so
much in the
apartment
with the children, or in her lady's
dressing
room, with Lappett, that he found it more difficult
than he at
first
imagined, and he was too cautious in
his affairs of gallantry to
use
pen and paper.
Lord and Lady
Ossiter
were a very
fashionable
couple;
they had married without affection,
because
their friends
thought they were exactly
suitable
for each other in
birth and fortune; his
Lordship
had always kept up a
show
of
politeness
towards his wife,
seldom
contradicted
her or complained of her expences, though in his
heart he
despised
her pride and affectation, and laughed
at her
absurdity
. He knew her well enough, to be
certain his honour was perfectly
safe
in her keeping, not
from a conviction of her principles being
just
or her
virtue
impregnable, but he was fully
sensible
that
self
-love
was her prevalent
passion
, and though
she
was
distractedly
fond of admiration, her heart was animated by
none of
those
sensibilities
which, though they in
general
elevate the female mind, not unfrequently lay it
open to the
greatest
errors.
One morning, as Rebecca was intently engaged in
completing the trimming we have mentioned, Mrs.
Harley unexpectedly entered the room.
A faint gleam of
pleasure
animated the countenance,
and beamed from the eyes of Rebecca, as
she
arose
to
receive this faithful
servant
of Lady Mary's.
Mrs. Harley,
said
she
, taking her cordially by
the hand, to what am I to attribute this unexpected
pleasure
.
Struck with her palid cheeks and altered air, Harley
first
brushed
off a
starting
tear and then
disclosed
her
errand
I come, my dear
Miss
, from my good young
master
If to bring me a letter,
said
Rebecca,
interrupting
her, I
must
beg you to
excuse
me
My dear child,
said
Harley, don't fly out in
this manner, but
listen
to me attentively; I have
children
of my own,
Miss
Littleton, and heaven forbid I
should
ever
advise
a young innocent creature to a wrong
step
;
trust
me, I am actuated only by
friendship
, when
I entreat you to inform me what motives you have for
thus
obstinately
refusing
the offers of a man of rank and
fortune, who loves you honourably and
sincerely
.
Do not
ask
me, dear Harley; do not let us talk
on this
subject
.
We will talk on no other then, for
sure
I am
there
must
be
some
powerful
reason
for your conduct.
Is your heart otherways engaged? Does want of
fortune
prevent your
happiness
?
Ah, no! no! my friend, cried Rebecca, her
head falling on Harley's
shoulder
, and her eyes filling
with tears; I am unhappy
because
I am not
insensible
.
You talk in riddles, my dear; if you are not
insensible
Oh,
stop
!
stop
! you
must
say
no more,
unless
you mean to break my heart; for, alas, Harley, the
last
time I
saw
my dear departed Lady Mary, I
promised
her,
solemnly
promised
her, by every hope of
selicity
, never to
listen
to an overture of love from Sir
George; and never, no never, while I retain the
least
remembrance of what is
past
, will I break a vow
so
solemnly
given.
This family pride,
said
Harley, was the only
foible my lady had.
She had no foible,
said
Rebecca; it was a
wish
to
insure
my felicity alone, prompted the
request
.
Whatever was her motive, my dear
Miss
,
promises
when once made
should
be
sacredly
observed
; I will
therefore
say
no more to you on the
subject
: Sir
George,
since
satisfied
you will not accept his offers, is
resolved
next Monday to leave England.
Rebecca turned pale, and Harley continued.
He means to
spend
the winter on the continent,
but has
desired
you will accept his mother's picture,
which he has had
fresh
set
on
purpose
for you, and this
trifle, laying a bank note for five hundred pounds on
the table. Now I will have no qualms and
squeamish
nonsense
,
Miss
Littleton; I am certain my lady meant
D
to have provided for youmore
shame
for
some
folks that
they forget her
last
commands; but we cannot always
make people do as they ought. Now, you
must
take this
money, and
consider
it as her
bequest
. I am
sure
you will
find it
necessary
very
soon
to quit this family; your dear
pale cheeks and heavy eyes tell me you
should
at this
moment
be in your bed, rather than at work. She then
drew out the picture, which was only
set
in plain gold.
Rebecca took it,
pressed
it to her lips, and, tying the
ribbon that was fixed to it round her neck, placed it as a
sacred
deposit
in her
bosom
. She
also
took the bank note
and put it in her pocket book, but
secretly
resolved
that
nothing but the
severst
necessity
should
tempt her to
break into it.
When Monday arrived, Rebecca could not avoid
approaching
the window at the
sound
of every carriage that
drew up to the door.
He will not
surely
leave England,
said
she
,
without
taking leave of his
sister
.
About two o'clock
she
saw
his chariot draw up to the
door, and, half concealing
herself
behind the window
shutter
, gazed on him, and breathed a prayer for his
felicity
,
as
she
saw
him alight. In about half an hour
she
was
desired
to bring
Miss
Ossiter
and
Master
James into
the drawing-room. She took them to the door, opened
it and put them in, but her feelings were too powerful to
permit her to enter.
Ah, uncle,
said
Miss
Ossiter
, running eagerly to Sir
George, I am glad you are come, I have been waiting
for you this long, long time.
Well, my dear Lucy,
said
he, fondly taking her on
his knee, and what might make you
wish
to
see
me
so
much.
Because
I love you dearly,
said
she
, throwing her
little arms round his neck, but that a'nt all.
No! what
else
was it then?
She lowered her voice, and, clapping her mouth
close
to his ear,
said
, I owe my maid half-a-crown, and I
told her you would pay her.
Sir George was
surprised
. And pray how does
that happen?
said
he.
Rebecca lent it me,
said
she
,
still
lowering her voice,
to give a poor man.
Rebecca, what Rebecca?
said
Sir George,
astonished
.
Why, Rebecca, replied the child; my own maid
Rebecca, that teaches me to read and
say
my prayers,
and tells me if I am good I
shall
go to heaven.
What
stuff
is the child talking?
said
Lady
Ossiter
,
catching the
last
word.
Sir George was too much affected to
speak
; he put a
couple of guineas into Lucy's hand, and
hastily
kissing
them all, hurried out of the
house
; as he
seated
himself
in the
chaise
, he
cast
his eyes towards the upper windows.
Rebecca caught the glance; the
impulse
was
irresistible
;
she
threw up the
sash
.
Sir George
kissed
his hand, while his countenance
betrayed
the feelings of his
soul
.
Rebecca laid her's on her heart, then
raised
them
towards
heaven, as
she
would have
said
, God
bless
you.
Drive on,
said
Sir George, and again bowing his
head to hide his emotions from the
servants
, a moment
conveyed him from her
sight
.
CHAP. XVII.
GALLANTRY, JEALOUSY, AND INTEGRITY.
I Do not think, my dear,
said
Lord
Ossiter
, as he
was taking his chocolate in his lady's
dressing
-room,
one morning about a fortnight after Sir George's
departure
.
I do not think it will be in my power to join the
intended party at Lady Rackett's to-night.
Some new engagement, my Lord,
said
her
Ladyship
,
smiling
affectedly.
Not a very agreeable one, he replied. I am obliged
to go into the City, on
some
infernal
business
with my
banker:
these
monied men are the
most
tiresome
animals in
the creation. He
says
I have overdrawn him, and
desires
I
will come and examine my accounts; it is a
cursed
stupid
affair, and I don't often concern
myself
about
such
things,
but the fellow is
so
pressing
.
But perhaps you can get away in time to
dress
and
join us, my Lord, before
supper
.
D 2
I will, if
possible
, but I dare
say
the wretch will make
me as
stupid
as
himself
before I have done with his
discounts
and
interests
,
so
I
shall
be horrid bad company; therefore
it is
most
likely I
shall
come home and go to bed.
To bed, my Lord, cried her
Ladyship
, laughing;
why,
sure
you are going to take pattern by the
sober
cit.
Though Lady
Ossiter
pretended to
desire
her Lord's
company, it was, in fact, the
farthest
thing from her
wishes
.
She had for
some
time
past
been admired and followed
by the Duke of; a
conquest
so
brilliant and
unexpected
,
was the
highest
gratification to this vain woman,
and
she
had heard with
pleasure
her
husband
's intended
appointment
in the city, as
she
was
resolved
to
see
his Grace
for half an hour at home, previous to their meeting at Lady
Rackett's ball, where
she
was engaged to dance with him.
But Lord
Ossiter
had frequently given her a few pretty
plain hints in regard to her conduct with her noble
admirer
,
and therefore, though
she
had
resolved
to
see
him,
she
thought it would be
best
to do it privately, and
Lappett
being unfortunately gone to
visit
a
sick
brother in the
country,
she
was obliged to make Rebecca her
considante
on the
occasion
, and immediately, on retiring from
breakfast
,
she
summoned
her to her
dressing
-room.
Rebecca, child,
said
she
, as
she
entered, I think
I have not given you any thing
since
you have been with
me, and you have done more than half of Lappett's
business
for her; there is that blue
satin
gown and coat, you may
take it, and as it is rather
soiled
, here is
something
to pay
for the dying and making up,
presenting
her with a
couple
of guineas. Do you know, child, (continued
she
) I
have taken the
strangest
whim in my head, and you
must
lend me your
assistance
. I think that trimming you made
me extremely pretty, I dare
say
it will be greatly admired.
I am happy it
pleases
you, Madam,
said
Rebecca:
but I thought you were
saying
you would have it altered.
Oh, no, I was not
speaking
of my
dress
then; I
think nothing can be more elegant or better fancied, but
you have a charming
taste
, that is certain. No, I was
going to tell you of a
strange
whim I had taken to play a
trick with the old Duke of; for, do you know
Rebecca, the man makes downright love to me whenever
he meets me, and the other day, when he was here, he left
behind him
these
superb
bracelets. Now, I have a mind
to mortify him, and as my Lord is going into the City, I
will
send
to the Duke to come here that I may have an
opportunity to return his
present
and laugh at him.
Would it not be better to
send
them to him,
said
Rebecca.
Oh, no, that will not do half
so
well, for then, I
should
not have the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his chagrin,
so
,
Rebecca, you
shall
take a note, which I will write, and
send
it, unknown to any of the other
servants
, and when
his grace comes he
shall
come
disguised
, and
pass
for your
brother, and you can bring him to my
dressing
-room.
Your
Ladyship
will pardon me,
said
Rebecca,
laying
the two guineas on the table, I am not fit to engage
in
such
a
service
; I would much rather decline it.
Decline it!
said
her
Ladyship
, reddening; pray
are you not my
servant
?
Undoubtedly Madam.
And is it not your duty to obey my orders?
When they are proper.
And pray are you to be the judge of what is proper or
improper in my actions?
By no means; but your
Ladyship
will allow me to
judge of my own.
Oh, certainly Madam, if you are too
squeamish
to
enter into
so
innocent a
scheme
.
I make no doubt but your
designs
, Madam, are
perfectly
innocent, but where there is
myslery
there is always
room for
suspicion
, and
should
my Lord
discover
it
But how can he, child, if you are
discreet
.
I am determined to be
so
, Madam, and hope you will
pardon my temerity, if I humbly entreat you to drop this
design
.
Prithee, good madam pert,
said
her
Ladyship
,
scornfully
, do not pretend to more delicacy and virtue
than your betters. I have as high a regard for my honour
as any woman can have, but I may indulge
myself
, I hope,
in a little innocent gallantry for all that. Go; I
shell
not
want you till I
dress
.
Rebecca retired, and for this once the pain her lady's
anger gave her was more than counterbalanced by the
reflexion
D 3
that
she
had acted right in rejecting the infamous
service
she
would have employed her in.
Contrary to her Lady's expectation, Rebecca had
scarcely
reached her own apartment when Lappett returned,
and entered the
dressing
-room, to receive Lady
Ossiter
's
command.
Well, Lappett,
said
she
, you are returned in very
good time, for I have been
so
grossly
affronted by that
little
prude, Rebecca, that I can hardly contain my anger;
do you know the impertinent creature had the audacity to
refuse
getting me a note conveyed to the Duke of;
though I had
condescended
to inform her that my
intentions
were only to laugh at him. You know, Lappett, there
is not a woman breathing would be more cautious than
myself
in doing any thing improper.
Dear, my Lady, I am
sure
of that; nor is your
Ladyship
,
by any means, obligated to enter into explanations
with your
servants
, to
speak
your command is always
sufficient
cient to have them
instantly
obeyed.
The
obsequious
abigail took the note, conveyed it
herself
,
and at eight o'clock in the evening his Grace was
admitted
to her Lady's
dressing
-room.
Lady
Ossiter
meant nothing
less
than to over-step the
boundaries of
discretion
in this
tete-a-tete
. The Duke
was to her an object of
disgust
, but flattery was delightful
to her ears, and pearls and diamonds were pretty ornaments
in her opinion,
easily
purchased
by a little
condesension
and
she
flattered
herself
, that while
she
remained virtuous in
one great point,
she
might indulge
herself
in every other
imprudence, and
desy
the
censures
of the world.
But it was the opinion of Rebecca, that every truly
virtuous
woman
should
carefully avoid even the appearance of
indiscretion
,
especially
those
whose
elevated
stations
might
render their examples infinitely pernicious to their
inferiors
:
she
therefore felt
herself
greatly hurt by Lady
Ossiter's
want of prudence, and flattered
herself
the
repulse
she
had met from her would prevent her making her
designs
known to any other
servant
, and
she
readily imagined
Mrs. Lappett would be as unwilling as
herself
to engage in
the
busness
;
so
when informed
she
was returned, Rebecca
found
herself
somewhat
relieved, as
she
knew
she
should
avoid the painful
task
of
dressing
a woman whom
she
feared
The
obsequious
abigail took the note, conveyed it
herself
,
and at eight o'clock in the evening his Grace was
admitted
to her Lady's
dressing
-room.
Lady
Ossiter
meant nothing

and

would be predetermined not to be
pleased
with her
utmost
exertion.
While the Duke and her
Ladyship
were together, the
artful Lappett thought
she
would
just
step
in and hear
what Rebecca had to
say
on the
subject
, for, by her
specious
appearance of
friendship
,
she
had
so
won on the
unsuspicious
heart of our heroine, that
she
never
scrupled
to
communicate to her every thought as it
arose
, except
those
which concerned Sir George, (and
those
she
endeavoured
to conceal, if
possible
, even from
herself
.)
So, cried Lappett,
sitting
down, my Lady and
you had a tiff to day, I find.
We did not quite agree,
said
Rebecca,
slightly
,
but I dare
say
she
has forgot it by this time; I am
sure
I do not
wish
to remember it.
I
suppose
she
wanted you to get a letter conveyed to
the Duke.
What then
she
has told you
herself
, has
she
?
Oh, Yes, the moment I came in. I declare it is a
pity my Lord is not acquainted with her conduct?
It would be a cruel thing, Mrs. Lappett, to plant
dissension
between man and wife:
besides
, I dare
say
, my
Lady, though imprudent, is not criminal.
To be
sure
my Lady has
some
excuse
; my Lord is
always after other women: he is
seldom
at home, and
I am
certain don't care a pin about his wife.
Perhaps if her
Ladyship
was more attentive to
increase
his
domestic
comforts, he would
necessarily
grow more
attached
to home, but while
she
is
so
extravagantly fond of
dissipation
, and while the four honours have the power to
keep her from home, night after night, can we be
surprised
if her
husband
seeks
abroad for that felicity he is
sure
of not meeting in his own
house
.
Why, to
say
truth, my Lady is a
sad
rake.
And her children, Mrs. Lappett,
she
pays but little
attention to them, nor will
she
suffer
any other
person
to
do it. Can there be a more lovely or engaging child than
Miss
Ossiter
. I am
sure
the little time I have to
instruct
her is amply repaid by her docility and attention; as to
Master
Ossiter
and his brother James, they are
so
humoured,
especially
the former, that it requires greater powers than
I am
possessed
of to make them attend to any thing.
I suppose
she
wanted you to get a letter conveyed to
the Duke.
What then
she
has told you
herself
, has
she
?
Oh, Yes, the moment I came in. I declare it is a
pity my Lord is not acquainted with her conduct.
It would be a cruel thing, Mrs. Lappett, to plant
difsension
between man and wife:
besides
, I dare
say
, my
Lady, though imprudent, is not criminal.
To be

my Lady has
some

always after other women: he is seldom at home, and
I am certain don't care a pin about his wife.
Perhaps if her
Ladyship
was more attentive to

his

grow more

to home, but while
she
is so extravagantly fond of
dissipation
, and while the four honours have the power to

surprised
if her
husband
seeks
abroad for that felicity he is

of not meeting in his own
house
.
D 4
He is very
passionate
,
said
Lappett.
Extremely
so
, replied the
artless
Rebecca;
besides
which, he is cruel,
mischievous
, and a great liar, and
these
things
should
be corrected in time, or he will be as
despicable
when a man, as he is now
disagreeable
as a child.
His temper is very like his mother's.
I think there is
some
similitude
between them, for
indeed
,
Mrs. Lappett, I do not know how you acquire
fortitude
to
support
it, but my Lady is
sometimes
so
passionate
and capricious I am ready to die with vexation, and,
though my heart be ready to
burst
, in her
presence
I dare
not
shed
a tear, for if
sometimes
, when I can no longer
suppress
them, they will
burst
forth,
she
reproaches me
with
childishness
,
passion
, and folly. Folly it is, I will
own, to let the behaviour of
so
unfeeling a woman wound
my
sensibility
; but yet when I know that I do my duty
to the
utmost
of my power, it is very hard to meet with
nothing in return but taunts and
unkindness
.
So it is indeed, my dear, but you
must
keep up your
spirits
.
I do, Mrs. Lappett, as well as I can, but my Lady
sometimes
asks
me what I am fit for? and if
she
had not
taken me, who would? That my Lord often tells her, he
wonders
she
will keep
so
awkward a creature about her. I
am
sensible
I have many obligations to her
Ladyship
's
family
,
but can I help my inexperience, unacquainted as I
am with
servitude
?
No, to be
sure
, you cannot: but my Lady will want
me, and I
shall
come in for my
share
, for I do
assure
you
child, we get it all round in turn; but you will know how
to bear
these
things better in time.
Lappett returned to her Lady and not only repeated but
exaggerated every thing which Rebecca, in the
simplicity
of her heart, had uttered.
Ungrateful creature,
said
the Lady, after what I
have done for her.
Ungrateful indeed, Madam. I wonder your
Ladyship
will keep her.
I
shall
not keep her long, Lappett; I
assure
you, I
am quite
sick
of her airs and impertinence.
The clock had
struck
ten, the children were in bed, and
Lady
Ossiter
just
stepped
into her chair and gone towards
Cavendish
-Square, the
servants
retired to the lower
apartments
,
and
silence
seemed
to reign throughout the
house
.
Rebecca, wearied with the fatigue and vexation of the day,
thought
she
might this evening
safely
indulge, in a
relaxation
,
which
she
had not enjoyed
since
her
residence
in
Lady
Ossiter
's family, which was to practice a few hours
on the
harpsicord
. She took her
music
books and a
candle
,
and went to a
small
parlour, in a retired part of the
house
, where
stood
a
sine
toned
instrument
, and where
she
sat
down and
amused
herself
, unthinking how time
past
,
and entirely inattentive to the
footsteps
that
passed
and
repassed
the door of the apartment. The
music
soothed
and
composed
the perturbation of her
spirits
. She played
several
little plaintive airs, and accompanied them with her
voice; and among the
rest
, the
song
she
was
signing
when
Sir George
first
saw
her. When
she
had got nearly through
it, the remembrance of that
scene
the
striking
contrast
of her
situation
then and now,
struck
so
forcibly on her
imagination that
she
was unable to proceed. She
paused
,
and tears involuntarily
stole
down her cheeks; her
amusement
was ended;
she
rose
from her
seat
, and was
shutting
the book, when
somebody
laid hold of her, and repeating,
as the maid retired,
He
kiss
'd her tears away.
clasped
her rudely in his arms and
snatched
a
kiss
.
Rebecca, too much terrified to
scream
, could only
endeavour
to
disengage
herself
, and turning round, beheld
Lord
Ossiter
.
If I have alarmed you, my dear creature,
said
his
Lordship
, I humbly entreat your pardon. But do not
let me interrupt your
amusement
; come,
sit
down again,
and let me hear that charming
song
you were
singing
when I entered the room.
Your
Lordship
will pardon me, I had no intention of
being heard by any one;I have
some
orders to execute
for my Lady.
Nay, nay, you do not get off
so
easily
. Do you
know, my lovely girl, I have been
absolutely
expiring
from the
first
moment I beheld you, for an opportunity
to tell you how much I admire and adore you.
D 5
Surely your
Lordship
cannot
seriously
mean to
insult
me.
Insult
you, my angel, no, by heavens I would
sacrifice
the wretch who
should
dare to offend you:No, my
dear girl, I mean to offer you love and affluence in the
room of dependence and poverty. I will place you in your
proper
sphere
:
such
beauty and elegance were not formed
for
servitude
. Come,
listen
to me, I will
furnish
you a
house
, keep you a chariot, and
settle
five hundred a year.
Gracious heaven, cried Rebecca,
bursting
into tears,
to what am I
exposed
.
Pshaw
,
pshaw
, this is all prudery and
nonsense
; come,
dry your tears and let us go to my jeweller's, and you
shall
take your choice of whatever trinkets his
shop
affords
,
I will not limit you as to the
sum
.
Lord
Ossiter
had but an indifferent opinion of female
delicacy; he thought the word virtue very pretty in the
mouth of a pretty woman, but as to the reality
existing
in the heart, he thought no woman
possessed
so
large a
share
but money, jewels, and flattery could lull it to
sleep
;
how
astonished
was he then to find, upon taking a few
liberties
with Rebecca,
she
shrunk
instinctively
from him,
shrieked
faintly, and,
staggering
a few paces toward the
door, fell
lifeless
to the floor.
Terrified, he caught her from the ground, and ringing
the bell with violence, began to tear open her gown and
handkerchief, in order to give her air. My dear, my
lovely girl,
said
he, for heaven's
sake
revive. Then
placing her on a
sofa
, he
seated
himself
beside
her, and
rested
her head on his
shoulder
.
At that moment who
should
appear at the door but
Mrs. Lappett, all the fury of a jealous enraged woman
flashing
from her eyes.
My dear Lappett,
said
his
Lordship
, I happened
to come unexpectedly into the room where this poor girl
was
amusing
herself
, and
see
how it has frightened her;
do get a little water.
But Lappett was not to be deceived:
she
had heard him
utter words of
tenderness
, and was
sufficiently
convinced
Rebecca was her rival.
The creature is
so
affected,
said
she
, I declare there
is no bearing her, but I
assure
your
Lordship
I have
something
else
to do than to wait on the
dear lovely girl
.
Rebecca was now recovering, and,
raising
her head,
she
caught hold of Lappett's gown, as
she
turned to leave the
room, and exclaimed, Do not leave me,
stay
,
save
me,
take me from this place.
Indeed, Madam, I am in a hurry, cried Lappett,
twitching her gown from the feeble
grasp
of Rebecca, and
flung out of the room, audibly
saying
, Her Lady
should
be informed what
sort
of a
person
she
had in her family.
Rebecca
arose
,
disengaged
herself
from his
Lordship
's
arms, who no longer attempted to detain her, and with
trembling
steps
returned to her apartment.
CHAP. XVIII.
FASHIONABLE LEVITIES.
So
, Madam, cried Lappett, as
she
was
assisting
her
Lady to
rise
the next morning;
so
, Madam,
though Mrs. Rebecca was
so
delicate as to
refuse
conveying
a letter to his Grace,
she
has no objection to private
interviews with my Lord. Oh, I could have torn the
creature's eyes out, an impertinent minx.
What are you talking of, Lappett,
said
her
Ladyship
,
with the
greatest
composure
, I
protest
you
seem
out of your
senses
.
I am, my Lady,
almost
, for when I reflect on
so
kind,
so
good a Lady as
yourself
being treated in
such
a
barbarous manner: why, Madam, after you were gone
last
night, I went up to
see
if Rebecca was doing the
dress
your
Ladyship
said
you would wear on
Thursday
,
and I could not find her; however, as I knew
she
sometimes
went to the library when you were not at home,
and
staid
and read for two or three hours, I
sat
down and
began a little of it
myself
, but, after working till
past
twelve o'clock, I thought it was very odd where
she
could
be,
so
I went down the back
stairs
, thinking perhaps
I
should
find her in the
housekeeper
's room, but as I
past
the little
music
parlour, I heard the
sound
of voice
and opening the door, what does your
Ladyship
think,
I
discovered
, I thought I
should
have
swooned
away, for
there
sat
Rebecca,
fast
locked in my Lord's arms, and
her head leaned on his
shoulders
.
Very well, cried Lady
Ossiter
,
peevishly
, the
crimson
of
resentment
rushing
over her face and neck, why
am I plagued with this long
story
: one would think you
were jealous of the creature, by the
passion
you are in.
I jealous, my Lady, does your
Ladyship
think?
Oh, no! I don't think about it; I
suppose
my Lord
is not
worse
than other men of his rank, and while he is not
wanting in
respect
to me, I
shall
not trouble
myself
about
his
amusements
; to be
sure
, it is rather mortifying to have
a little
insignificant
hussy
preferred in one's own
house
.
That is what I
say
, Madam.
You have no right to
say
or think about it; if I am
satisfied
with my Lord's conduct, I
desire
I may hear
none of your
slippant
impertinence upon a
subject
that
don't concern you.
have
done, Ma'am, but I hope you'll
discharge
I certainly
shall
discharge
every
servant
of mine,
whose
conduct
displeases
me, therefore, Lappett, read that
impudent
scrawl
, and then let me know what wages are due
to you.
Lappett took the letter, and trembled as
she
took it,
for
she
knew it to be one which
she
had written to her
sister
, and having
intrusted
it to the
house
maid to put it
in the
post
, the girl's
curiosity
led her to open it, but,
being
surprised
by the entrance of her lady
whilst
in the
act of reading it,
she
had, in her hurry to put it in her
pocket, dropped it, and while the officious Lappett was
contriving to introduce the Duke unperceived to her
Lady
,
this unfortunate letter
discovered
her criminal
intercourse
with her Lord. But though Lady
Ossiter
had thus
bridled her
passion
while talking to her infamous
confidante
,
she
no
sooner
saw
the innocent Rebecca, than
she
vented on her that torrent of
abuse
fear had prevented
her from pouring on the other.
Artful infamous
strumpet
, were her elegant
expressions
,
to pretend to
such
resinement
of
sentiment
, and yet be
guilty of
such
glaring faults.
In vain Rebecca wept, and called on heaven to
witness
her innocence; even when kneeling,
she
requested
not to
be bereaved of her only refuge, an
unblemished
character.
The haughty Lady
Ossiter
spurned
her from her, and bid
her
instantly
leave her
house
, and get her bread without,
for
she
was well convinced
she
did not
deserve
one.
Lord
Ossiter
, prepared as he was to meet her anger,
was unable to bear the illiberal
abuse
with which
she
loaded
him; he therefore
satisfied
himself
with telling her, when
she
practised
the duties of a wife, he would begin to
study
those
of a
husband
; till then,
she
had no right to complain,
and left her to
compose
her
spirits
, as
she
could, while he
inquired of his valet what he knew concerning Rebecca.
He
soon
learnt, by inquiries being made among the
servants
,
that Rebecca was
dismissed
, and that
she
had taken
a place in the
Lincolnshire
stage
, in order to return to her
mother. This was
sufficient
intelligence for his
Lordship
,
and he began to plan
schemes
for getting her in his power.
When Rebecca came to take leave of the children, her
feelings were
undescribable
.
Miss
Ossiter
hung about her
neck; even Charles and James begged her not to
they would be good boys and never vex her by behaving
ill again. She embraced them all tenderly, and with a
heart
almost
broken, got into a hackney-coach, which
took her to the inn from whence the
stage
set
out. She
asked
to be
shown
to an apartment, and ordered
some
trifle for her
supper
, then
sitting
down by a little
solitary
fire, began to reflect on her vexations, nor did
she
consider
it as the
least
, that
she
was obliged to return to her
mother
who had written to her but twice during her
residence
in London, and even
those
letters were
short
and
cold.
The five hundred pounds Mrs. Harley had given her,
she
did not
consider
as her own property, and
besides
that,
she
was
possessed
of but ten guineas in the world; to be
sure
she
had a few valuable trinkets,
presents
from Lady
Mary
,
and a good
stock
of clothes; but what was that, when
she
wanted
support
it would
soon
be gone. In the
midst
of
these
painful reflexions
she
drew the picture of her
benefactress
from her
bosom
, and contemplated it as her
chief, her
almost
only comfort. But, examining it more
minutely than
she
had ever before done,
she
thought
she
discovered
something
like a
spring
on the edge of the
setting
,
and
pressing
her finger on it, the back flew off and
discovered
to her the portrait of Sir George, fixed
behind
that of his mother.
Spite of
herself
she
could not help gazing on it with
pleasure
, and when
she
considered
the delicacy with which
he had managed to
present
it to her, he
rose
higher
than ever in her
esteem
.
Ah,
said
she
, he certainly loves me, and is worthy
my
esteem
. Why are we not born for each other, for
sure
I am, I could be content with Sir George, though in
the
humblest
station
: morefar more happy than in an
elevated
sphere
; for in the humbler walks of life the
felicity
we experience
must
proceed from a mutual
desire
to
please
, but in an exalted
station
we live not for
ourselves
but others, at
least
if we have not fortitude to
scorn
and
despise
the
sneers
of the
fashionable
world.
Rebecca could not help
considering
the
possession
of this
portrait, at this period, as an invaluable
treasure
, and in
her own
breast
solemnly
vowed never to part from it. She
indulged
herself
in gazing on it while
she
sat
up, and
she
retired to bed, laid it on her pillow, and fell
into a
composed
slumber
, which
lasted
till called at four
o'clock to join the
passengers
in the coach.
Refreshed
and comforted by the
rest
she
had taken, Rebecca
arose
with alacrity to
pursue
her journey, and nothing material
occurred till they had proceeded upwards of fifty miles
from town, when the coach was overtaken by a
post
-
chaise
and four, in which was a man, who
stopped
the
coachman
and
asked
if there was not a young
person
within
side
of the name of Littleton. Yes, cried Rebecca,
innocently
looking out of the window, my name is Littleton.
Ah, Ma'am, cried the man, I am commanded to
entreat you to return.
Miss
Ossiter
was
last
night taken
extremely ill, and cries continually for you; my Lady
therefore begs you will forget what is
past
, and come and
take your
usual
station
in the family. She is convinced of
your innocence, but if
disagreeable
to
yourself
,
she
will
only
desire
you to remain till
Miss
Ossiter
is better.
Rebecca's heart, formed for the
warmest
affection, beat
high when
she
heard of her little favourite's
illness
. The
ill treatment
she
had experienced from Lady
Ossiter
was
instantly
forgot, and
she
thought only of returning as
quick as
possible
to attend the dear little girl. She
sprang
hastily
from the coach, and only taking with her a
small
portmanteau, containing a
necessary
change of linen, got
into the
chaise
, and though drawn as quick as four
horses
could carry her,
she
thought every moment an hour,
so
anxious was
she
to arrive in Bedford-Square.
CHAP. XIX.
SEDUCTION.
It
was very late when Rebecca entered London, and
she
was not enough acquainted with the
streets
to know
whether
she
was going right or wrong; therefore, when
the
chaise
stopped
in a large
square
,
she
jumped eagerly
out and ran into the
house
, without once
considering
whether
she
knew the place; but when
she
had got in the
hall and the door was
shut
,
just
as
she
was going to run
up
stairs
, the
staircase
, which was different to the one
she
had been
used
to,
struck
her, and turning
hastily
round to
demand why
she
was brought to a
strange
place,
she
the parlour door open, and in an
instant
Lord
Ossiter
was
at her feet.
Good God!
said
she
, where am I? why am I
thus betrayed?
You are not betrayed my adorable
Miss
Littleton,
said
he; let me entreat you to be calm. Grieved to the
soul
that Lady
Ossiter
should
have treated you
so
unworthily
,
I made
use
of an innocent
stratagem
to bring you
back, that I might obtain your pardon, and convince you
that I am ready to expiate, with my life, the offence
she
has committed
against
you.
If that is all, cried Rebecca,
scarcely
able to
respire
,
through terror,
assure
yourself
I have forgiven you, my
Lord, and will pardon the deceit you have been guilty
of, if you will
suffer
me
instantly
to quit this
house
, where
every moment I remain fills me with
anguish
and terror.
Why do you
wish
to quit this
house
, my dear angel,
said
he, forcibly leading her into the parlour; it is your
own, every thing in it is your's; all the
servants
are ready
to obey your commands. Then ringing the bell, he
ordered
all the
servants
to appear, and bid them
consider
Rebecca as their
mistress
, and obey her, as they valued
his future favour.
Ah, my friends,
said
Rebeca, do not attend to
what he
says
; I have no right to command you, I am only
a
servant
, like
yourselves
, and
such
I
wish
to remain; only
continue to me,
just
heaven! cried
she
, fervently
raising
her eyes and hands, my innocence
unsullied
, and my
integrity of mind
unshaken
.
Be
composed
my
dearest
love,
said
his
Lordship
,
dismissing
the
servants
, no harm
shall
happen to you while
under my protection.
Oh! cried
she
, in an agony, I
see
,
unless
some
protecting
angel hovers over me, I am threatened with the
worst
of dangers. Let me go, Sir! by what authority
do you detain me here.
Whither would you go, my dear creature at this late
hour; if you quit this
house
no reputable door will open to
receive you, and I am
sure
, my
sweet
Rebecca would
not enter a
house
of infamy.
Alas! alas! my Lord, I fear I have done that
already
,
though heaven knows how innocently.
My lovely girl, do but
compose
your agitated
spirits
,
and every thing will appear to you in a different light; let
me
send
your own woman to you,
she
shall
wait on you to
your own apartment, where I beg you will take
some
refreshment
,
and endeavour to
repose
yourself
; I
swear
to
you, Rebecca, I will not enter your chamber till you give
me leave.
Merciful heaven! cried Rebecca, what will
become
of me?
Lord
Ossiter
retired, and an elderly woman made her
appearance with candles.
Rebecca for a few moments
stood
irresolute
; at length
she
determined to go up
stairs
with the woman, and by a
pretended
calmness
, endeavoured to
sound
her principles,
and whether
she
was entirely devoted to the
interest
of her
Lord. When
she
was in the apartment which the woman
called her own,
she
sat
down on a
sofa
, and calmly
inquired
who
slept
in the adjoining apartment.
I do, Madam, was the
answer
.
Have you been long in this
house
?
I was only hired
yesterday
, Madam; and my Lord's
gentleman informed me the
house
was taken for a young
lady, a relation of his
master
's, who was expected from
the country.
And when do you expect
she
will arrive?
said
Rebecca
,
with
assumed
indifference.
Madam, cried the woman,
staring
, are you not
the lady?
No, indeed I am no relation of his
Lordship
's; I
lived in his family, as a
servant
to
dress
,
undress
, and
teach
Miss
Ossiter
to read.
But you are
just
come from the country now, Madam?
I was on my journey into the country, when I was
fetched back again. I
understood
Miss
Ossiter
was ill.
My Lord undoubtedly has a great regard for you,
and means to give you in this
house
a brilliant
establishment
.
You can
surely
have no objection to exchange
servitude
for affluence.
It is a
desirable
change, certainly, if made on
honourable
terms.
Liberality, my dear Madam, is
sometimes
an
equivalent
for honour.
Are
these
your real
sentiments
?
said
Rebecca, with
a
scrutinizing
look.
They are the
sentiments
of one half of the world
But had you a child, would you talk to her in this
strain
; would you
wish
her to barter all
she
ought to hold
dear in life, for the paltry
consideration
of
splendour
?
She looked, as
she
spoke
,
earnestly
in the woman's face:
it was an entreating,
supplicating
look, and the tears
gushed
from her eyes.
I had a daughter once, replied the attendant, (whom
we
shall
distinguish
by the name of Harris:)
she
was
lovely as you are
she
was once as innocent; but
innocence
could not
shield
her from the calumny of the world,
and ill treatment depraved a heart formed for the love and
practice of virtue. She
paused
, her eyes filled, and
Rebecca
began to hope
she
should
find a friend that would
assist
her in
escaping
the artful
snare
spread
by Lord
Ossiter
, to entrap her innocence.
Mrs. Harris, finding her remain
silent
, left the room,
and in about ten minutes returned with a boiled chicken,
which
she
entreated Rebecca to take part of before
she
retired to
rest
.
I am totally unable to take any
rest
,
said
Rebecca;
but where is my Lord?
Gone home, and left his valet, in conjunction with
myself
, to wait your commands.
Or rather to be my jailers,
said
Rebecca; but
come, Mrs. Harris, (for
she
had inquired her name) come
sit
down, and if you will partake my
supper
, I will
endeavour
to eat
some
. You were
speaking
of your daughter,
I
should
like to hear
something
more concerning her.
Ah, Madam, her
story
is but
short
, but it will melt
your heart; indeed I do not know that I
should
tell it
you at this time, but
something
whispers
me, it will be
right to give you
some
information concerning the villainy
of men. Perhaps you have a mother,
Miss
.
I have, replied Rebecca, her thoughts
instantly
reverting
to her dear native village.
Oh, may
she
never experience the
anguish
of heart I
have felt, in
seeing
her darling
lost
to every
sense
of
shame
in this world, and to every hope of peace in the next.
My
husband
was a reputable
tradesman
; we
possessed
not the luxuries of life, but we enjoyed its comforts, and
were content. We had but one child;
she
was the joy
of our hearts, the prop on which we
rested
for
happiness
.
My
husband
had a
sister
who had lived many years a
housekeeper
with a nobleman: this
sister
was godmother
to my girl, who was
christened
Jane, in compliment to
her. When Jenny was thirteen, her aunt declared
she
would
give her a couple of years at a
respectable
boarding
school
,
and then think about
setting
her in
some
way of getting
her bread.
I had forgot to tell you,
Miss
, that my
husband
and
self
lived upwards of twenty miles from London, and it
was with great difficulty we brought
ourselves
to part with
our darling; but confidering it would be for her
interest
to
go with her aunt, we at length
consented
, and were
satisfied
with
seeing
her at holliday time, and exulted not a
little at the evident improvement
discernable
in her
person
and manners, whenever
she
renewed her
visit
. The two
years were
past
, and Jenny, taken from
school
, was placed
with an eminent milliner, in which
business
her aunt
promised
to
set
her up when her
apprenticeship
expired.
It happened one day, when
she
had been to dine with
her aunt, that going up the front
stairs
, to fetch
something
from an upper apartment,
she
was met by a young
gentleman
,
who
stopped
, made room for her, and bowed as
she
passed
him. The next day, as
she
was at work in the
shop
, the
same
gentleman came in and
asked
to look at
some
gloves;
she
arose
to
serve
him.
Bless
me,
Miss
,
said
he, did I not
see
you
yesterday
at Lord Melvin's?
She
answered
in the affirmative.
I was there,
said
he,
carelessly
, to receive her
Ladyship
's order concerning the alteration of
some
furniture
.
I have the honour to do the
most
of the
upholstery
business
for them.
They then fell into chat. He wondered he had never
seen
her before, as he was
so
well acquainted with her aunt,
and begged leave
sometimes
to call and inquire after her
health. From this an intimacy took place, and Mr. Smith
made
proposals
of marriage, which were approved of by
the aunt: he even mentioned buying her indentures of her
mistress
, that the union might be expedited. But in the
midst
of this Jenny could not help remarking, that Mr.
Smith never
asked
her to his
house
; but her aunt
said
it
was his
tenderness
for her reputation that prevented him.
And he began to hint that he had made
several
lucky hits
in the lottery, and
should
leave off
business
, or at
least
throw it into
such
a line, that a few hours attendance every
day would be
sufficient
, and the
rest
might be performed
by
persons
whom he would employ for that
purpose
.
Things were in this
state
when we were wrote to, and the
match, as
represented
by her aunt, being every way beyond
our expectations, we freely gave our
consent
; nay,
so
delighted
were we with the hope of her being
so
well
settled
,
that we made our neighbours partakers of our joys, and
our daughter's good fortune was
universally
talked of.
One evening, as we were
sitting
in our little parlour,
talking
of our future
prospects
, among which was the hope of
seeing
our dear girl and her
husband
, immediately after
her marriage, we were
startled
by a loud rap at the door,
and Mr. Harris having opened it, our poor Jenny
rushed
in, pale,
breathless
, and to all appearance
sinking
with
fatigue. My love, you are welcome,
said
I, catching her
in my arms; this is kind indeed to make us
so
early a
visit
but where is your
husband
?
Husband
!
said
she
, wildly; I have no
husband
.
Who told you I was married?
Your aunt wrote us word, my dear, you were to
have been married four days
since
.
She laid her hand upon her forehead, as though
endeavouring
to recollect
something
. I believe it was
so
,
said
she
, but that aunt of mine is a
sad
woman, for
though I thought I was married, it was all a
falsehood
.
And do you know, my dear mother, I am a poor undone
creature; but do not
spurn
me from youindeed I am
not wilfully guilty.
Here
she
paused
, and,
sinking
on her knees before us,
her emotions became
so
violent, that
she
was unable to
proceed, and we conveyed her to bed, in a
state
little
short
of
absolute
distraction
. For
several
days
she
was
unable
to give us any account of what had befallen her. She
was
feverish
,
sometimes
delirous, and when any lucid
intervals
appeared, too weak and languid to be capable of
speaking
more than two or three words at a time. When
she
began to recover,
she
gave us an account that
almost
broke our hearts; indeed her father never held up his head
again, but drooped and pined till a
consumption
put a
period to his
existence
.
CHAP. XX.
DELIVERANCE.
She
told us, that at the time appointed her
mistress
gave up her indentures to Mr. Smith, and
she
accompanied
her aunt and lover to his
house
, which was
situated
in a newly built
street
: was
small
, but commodious,
and elegantly
furnished
; which
she
attributed to his
having
been in that way of
business
. Here, it
seems
, they
were, as
she
thought, married; Mr. Smith
saying
, he had
an objection to public weddings, and did not mind a little
extra expence to have things conducted with delicacy and
privacy. Two days after her marriage, her
husband
said
he
should
be obliged to leave her for the night, having a
little
business
to
transact
a few miles out of town, but he
would be with her again by dinner the next day. After
he was gone, feeling
herself
rather
solitary
,
she
put on
her hat and cloak and went to her
mistress
's, where
she
found
several
of her old companions preparing to go
to the play. This being a
diversion
she
was fond of, but
little
persuasion
was
necessary
to get her to join the party;
accordingly, attended by a genteel young man, they
proceeded
to Covent-Garden, and got a very excellent
seat
in the two
shilling
gallery. The
first
act of the play
was nearly
finished
, when a little
bustle
in the
stage
-box
occasioning
Jenny to look that way,
she
saw
her
husband
enter, leading a very plain woman,
superbly
dressed
, and
take his
seat
beside
her on the front row.
Look, Lucy,
said
she
, to one of her companions,
would you not
almost
swear
that was Mr. Smith.
Why, it is Mr. Smith, returned the girl,
innocently
,
I am
sure
it is him.
If,
said
the young man who was with them, you
mean the gentleman in the
stage
box, with that ordinary
woman, you are
mistaken
in the name; that is Mr.
Ponsonville
,
eldest
son
to the earl of Melvin.
But I am
sure
you are
mistaken
, cried Lucy, with
vivacity. You will give a lady leave to know her own
husband
, I hope, and Mrs. Smith here claims that
gentleman
as her property.
I am
sorry
for it, replied the young man, for I
am convinced that is Mr.
Ponsonville
, and that Lady
beside
him is his wife; my father has made his clothes ever
since
he was a boy.
Jenny, who had
sat
in
silent
agitation during this
little
dialogue, now ventured to
ask
if he meant the
son
of
Lord Melvin, of Melvin Court.
The
same
, he replied.
A
confused
idea now
rushed
into her mind, that
she
had been vilely betrayed. She was
sensible
that the
person
she
saw
was the man
she
called her
husband
; and if he was
in reality Mr.
Ponsonville
, and the
husband
of another
she
was utterly ruined.
These
reflexions prevented her
having any enjoyment of the play, and at the end of it
she
requested
the young man to
see
her into a hackney-coach,
as
she
found
herself
not inclined to
see
the entertainment.
She drove immediately to her aunt's, but the coachman
was not able to draw up to the door, on account of
several
carriages. She got out at the corner of the
square
, and
proceeded on foot to the
house
, where
she
arrived
just
as
an elegant chariot drew up.
Curiosity
led her to go near,
in order to
see
the
guests
alight. The chariot door opened,
and Mr.
Ponsonville
alighted, handing out the
same
lady
she
had
seen
at the play. This was proof
sufficient
;
she
was too near then to be deceived
Ponsonville
and Smith
were the
same
. She
staggered
a few
steps
forward, faintly
articulated his name, and
sunk
lifeless
on the pavement.
Mrs.
Ponsonville
, though plain in her
person
,
possessed
a humane heart:
she
saw
her fall, and ordered the
servants
to
raise
her and carry her in, and giving orders for
her to be taken care of, left her. Whatever
Ponsonville
's
feelings were, he
disguised
them
so
well, his lady did not
in the
least
suspect
his
interest
in the fainting Jane. And,
having informed Lady Melvin of what had happened,
she
requested
that the orders
she
had given might be enforced
by her
Ladyship
; and Harris was ordered to take
particular
care of the young woman. The
servant
summoned
to receive
these
commands informed her
Ladyship
that it
was
Miss
Harris, who, they imagined, was coming to
see
her aunt, who had fainted, and that
she
was now
recovering
and in the
housekeeper
's room; the Ladies therefore
imagining
she
was in good hands, made no farther inquiry.
When Jenny recovered
she
began lamenting her hard
fate, and
accusing
her aunt of deceiving her; but that
kind relation would not let her proceed.
What would the fool be at,
said
she
; keep your
own
secret
, and nobody that you need care for will be the
wiser
;
besides
I have had your
interest
at heart and your
fortune is made. Here (continued
she
, going to a
beaureau
)
here is a
settlement
of five hundred a year as long
as you live.
Jenny caught the parchment from her, and tore it in
pieces: Thus
perish
, (
said
she
) every
sign
of my
dishonour
what
are riches without innocence.As you
have
lost
the one, you might as well have kept the other,
said
her aunt.
Jenny left the
house
without deigning a reply. The
next morning early
Ponsonville
was with her. Hard was
the
struggle
between love and honour; for
she
really
loved her
seducer
with the
most
enthusiastic
passion
. His
sighs
, his tears were infectious;
she
requested
till the next
day to
consider
, but
she
was well convinced to deliberate
was to be
lost
, and be had no
sooner
left her, than
she
ordered a
chaise
, and flew for protection to the arms of
her parents.
But we
soon
discovered
that the poor girl's
misfortune
would be made public. We were pitied by
some
,
laughed at and ridiculed by others, and the finger of
scorn
was pointed at my unfortunate child whenever
she
ventured abroad. We
sold
all our little
possessions
, and
repaired to London, where we thought to hide our
shame
in
obscurity
. Here my poor
husband
paid the debt of
nature, and Jenny became the mother of a fine boy.
As
she
passed
for a widow, and was in the full bloom
of beauty, it is not to be wondered that
she
should
be
addressed
on the
score
of marriage by a young man who
kept a
persumery
and toy-
shop
in the neighbourhood.
Jenny's heart was
still
too full of the idea of
Ponsonville
to
suffer
any other attachment to grow on it; but poverty
began to
stare
us in the face:
she
saw
on one
side
, a
mother, a child pining with want, no protector, no friend
to comfort and relieve them; on the other, a home, a
protector, and a place of refuge for
those
objects
so
dear
to her heart. She acceded to his
proposal
and was
married
.
Three years
passed
on in tranquillity at
least
, and
my daughter was the mother of another boy and a girl,
but I
saw
she
was not
destined
to be happy: her
husband
was frequently
morose
and
peevish
, and
spent
much of
his time at clubs and public
houses
. But I knew they
had a good
business
, and therefore did not dread her
experiencing the evils of poverty. One day, as I was in
the
shop
, I
saw
a chariot draw up, and immediately
called
Jenny to attend. She came
just
as the gentleman
descended
and entered the
shop
. Good heaven!
exclaimed
he. Jenny turned pale and leaned
against
the
counter. The gentleman recollected
himself
Is not
your name Harris?
said
he, advancing.
No,
said
she
,
saintly
, it once was, but I am
married.
Cursed
fate! cried he, vehemently. I am at
liberty, and have
sought
you with unremitting diligence,
to do you the
justice
your virtue merits.At that
instant
her
eldest
boy ran into the
shop
. Mother,
said
he, taking her hand.
And
whose
is this cherub?
said
he, taking the boy
on his knee, for he had
seated
himself
.
Mine, replied Jenny.And what is your name,
my
sweet
fellow? to the child.
Ponsonville
Smith,
said
the boy.
Ponsonville
, cried he,
visibly
agitated.
Ponsonville
;and
how old are you?
Four years
last
Christmas
.
Jenny, cried he, taking hold of her hand. Jenny,
my love, how like a villain I have behaved to this boy
and you.
He drew her towards him with one hand, while
he embraced the child with the other. She
sunk
on a
seat
beside
him, her head
sell
on his
shoulder
, and they
both wept.What a moment was this for the
husband
to enter,he did enter. Jenny
started
, a deep
blust
was
succeeded
by a deadly
paleness
, and it was with
difficulty
we got her into the parlour.
Ponsonville
, now Lord Melvin, made
some
trifling
purchase
, and went away. I
saw
the
storm
that
lowered
on her
husband
's brow; it
burst
forth in cruel
invective
,
and, having traced Lord Melvin, and from
some
officious
person
learnt the whole
story
, he was not content
with reproach only, but added even blows, and at length
proceeded to that pitch of brutality as to turn my child
and her unoffending offspring into the
street
. Lord
Melvin called to inquire for his boy,he heard the
tidings
,
and never
rested
till he
discovered
our place of
retreat.
Miserable
indeed was the apartment where he
found his Jenny. He offered her independence for
herself
,
her mother, and children. I
blush
to add the
remainder
,
but let no one
boast
their virtue till the cold hand
of poverty has tried its
strength
to the
utmost
. Jenny
accepted his
proposals
, and for
seven
years, affluence
was her portionbut alas, not content; her heart bled,
her
anguish
was
undescribable
, but
she
wore the
smile
of
conent on her face, and the misjudging world thought
her happy. Alas! (
she
would
say
) alas! my children,
what does your mother
sacrifice
for you. But my Lord
died
suddenly
, and died
intestate
: there was
some
flaw
found in the
settlement
made on Jenny, by his heir, and
she
was again reduced to poverty. When the human
mind has gone a few
steps
in vice, how
easy
does it
proceed
:
my Jenny had
associated
with women
whose
situation
were like her own; by degrees her mind
lost
that
strong
sense
of rectitude which nature had implanted
there, and
she
yielded, without compunction, to the
solicitations
of another lover. I will proceed no farther;
she
is now gone, and in her
last
hours regretted the
loss
of that purity of heart which alone could have enabled
her to meet that awful moment with
composure
.
The tears that
sell
from Mrs. Harris's eyes encouraged
Rebecca. She
slid
from her
seat
on her knees before
her. And can you, my dear Mrs. Harris,
said
she
,
in a
most
persuasive
tone of voice, Can you, who have
felt
so
much for a child, behold a poor forlorn creature,
who,
unless
you help her,
must
be inevitably
lost
plunged
into that
abyss
of guilt and
misery
which
must
sink
her beneath the regard of every virtuous
person
. Oh!
rather
stretch
forth thy hand and
save
her. I am innocent
now, be thou my guardian angel, and deliver me from
this dreadful place. I can work, Mrs. Harris,I am not
ashamed
to work, even in the
meanest
capacityI will be
ashamed
of nothing but
dishonour
.
Mrs. Harris
raised
her, and
spoke
to her words of
comfort
.
They
sat
together till the clock
struck
four, and
then, taking off their
shoes
and putting out the light,
they
stole
softly
down
stairs
and out at the
street
door.
Mrs. Harris knew where
she
should
find a
stand
of
he">she
should
find a
stand
of
,
and proceeding there without
molestation
, they
got into one, and drove to a decent looking
house
in the
Borough, the
mistress
of which readily admitted them,
and Rebecca having offered up her
thanksgiving
to the
protector of innocence, retired to a homely but clean bed,
and enjoyed
several
hours of uninterrupted
repose
.

CHAPTER XXI.
A NEW PLACE.
When
Rebecca awoke
she
found
herself
greatly
refreshed
, and
arose
with a heart deeply
impressed
with gratitude to Mrs. Harris, who had thus
unexpectedly delivered her from the
worst
of all evils.
She went down
stairs
, and as
she
was taking her
breakfast
began to talk of what
she
must
do in future. I had
some
intention of returning to my mother, (
said
she
)
but I think now I had rather endeavour to get a place.
I have but a
trisle
in my
purse
, but by writing to
Lincolnshire
I can have my trunks returned, and I have
some
money in them, and I will beg your
acceptance
of part of it for the eminent
service
you have
rendered me; in the meantime I
shall
be much obliged
to you if you could recommend me to a place, if you
heard of any thing which you thought would
suit
me.
Mrs. Harris and her friend gave our heroine a
cordial
invitation to remain with them till
she
could hear
from her mother, and
promised
to inquire for a place
which might
suit
her abilities, as
she
seemed
to
wish
to
wait on a very young lady, or be companion to an
elderly
one, as
she
was certain her
constitution
would not
suffer
her to engage with a woman of
fashion
, who kept
a great deal of company and late hours, of which
she
had experienced a
sufficient
specimen
in Lady
Ossiter
.
Rebecca
addressed
a letter to her mother, briefly
informing
her
she
had left her Lady and was in
quest
of
another place. That
she
had at
first
intended to
return
home, and to that end had forwarded her trunk,
which
she
requested
might be
sent
to town again by the
first
conveyance. In about four days
she
received the
following
answer
.
DEAR CHILD,
I am
sorry
to find you have left Lady
Ossiter
as I
imagine you
must
have
grossly
offended her
Ladyship
before
she
could have parted with you, as you was
such
a favorite with her mother; however, Rebecca, you
chose
to leave your father's
house
, and to conduct
yourself
by the advice of
strangers
, you therefore know
best
child, what you are about; I
shall
not take upon me to
advise
, where my advice will be
disregarded
. As to
coming into the country, I think it would be putting
yourself
to a
needless
expence, as I know you would
never
be happy to
stay
here: and
sensible
as I was of
that, you cannot wonder I have
chosen
a companion
and protector for
myself
, and by uniting with the
worthy
Mr. Serle, have upon his daughter and family a claim
to
those
tendernesses
and attentions I in vain expected
from my own child. Mr. Serle went to the inn and
inquired
for your trunk, but we can hear nothing of it;
you
must
therefore inquire for it at the inn from whence
the coach
sets
out in London.
As you always were, or pretended to be a little
philosopher
, I have no doubt but you will get very
well through the world; and you have youth and a
good
constitution
on your
side
. I
shall
always be glad
to hear of your welfare; above all things, Rebecca, be
modest
and virtuous, and mind your religious duties,
as your poor father and I always taught you; and never
forget that you have a mother who loves you, and to
whom all your duty and
respect
is due. Mr. Serle and
Miss
Peggy
desire
me to give their
best
wishes
to you,
though they have no acquaintance with you.
I am, dear child,
Your affectionate mother,
R. SERLE.
Rebecca's
sensations
, on the receipt of this letter,
are better imagined than
described
. Scarcely fix months
had
elapsed
since
the death of her father, and her
mother
was married againthat mother, who, but a
short
time
since
, had declared, that to be
suspected
capable of
admitting a
second
partner, was an
insult
that hurt her
feelings
excessively
.
Rebecca now felt that
she
was in reality a poor
solitary
being, without a home, and
almost
without a friend;
E 2
to be
sure
Mrs. Harris had been very kind to her, but
could
she
expect that
kindness
to
last
when
she
had
lost
the power of making her any
recompense
. However
she
determined to make
some
inquiry concerning her
trunk, and to that end
requested
Mrs. Harris to
accompany
her; but all the tidings
she
could learn was,
that the coachman had left it in the country, and that
he had
since
heard it had been taken away by a
person
who
said
he came from
Miss
Littleton
herself
, with
orders
to pay all
necessary
expences.
Was there any thing of much value in the trunk?
said
Mrs. Harris.
Alas! cried Rebecca, there was the
greatest
part of my clothes, and a five hundred pound bank
note, which I had to keep for a
person
who is gone
abroad.
Pray, child, what kind of a man is this
father-in-law
of your's?
Indeed I can hardly tell you; he never
visited
my
father during his life, nor did I ever
see
him above twice,
except at church; he has been a widower
some
years,
and has one daughter; he is an attorney by
profession
,
but I believe he had never much practice.
Perhaps your mother's annuity was the object that
invited this marriage.
It may be
so
, but I can hardly think it, for at the
utmost
it is not more than forty pounds year. My
mother has an agreeable
person
, and lively manner; I
do not think it improbable but he may have married
her for love.
I do not think it improbable but he has got your
trunk.
Dear, Mrs. Harris, how can you
suggest
such
a
thing; you quite
shock
me.
Shock you or not, I think that is really the
case
,
and I would
advise
you to
pursue
legal methods to
discover
it.
No, cried Rebecca,
resolutely
, never; I
cannot
bring
myself
to
suspect
that my mother would unite
herself
to a man capable of
such
an action, and if that
were really the
case
, I hope I have too high a
sense
of
silial
respect
to attempt
exposing
her to the malicious
censures
of a world, who would not fail to involve her,
however innocent, in her
husband
's guilt. My own
interest
shall
ever give way to her peace of mind, for
she
was the
chosen
companion, the
bosom
friend of the
best
of fathers, and though
she
seems
to have forgot that I am
her child, I can never forget
she
is my mother.
All this may be very clever, for what I know,
said
Mrs. Harris, but I am
sure
, in my opinion, it is very
ridiculous. You will find, my poor
simple
child, your
six
guineas will go but a little way towards buying you
clothes fit for a decent place; however, we
must
not
meet troubles half way, it will be time enough when you
have got a place, to think about preparing to go to it;
but I have an acquaintance lives in this
street
, who
perhaps
may have it in her power to help you to
something
.
They called on the
person
mentioned, who was lady's
woman in an opulent merchant's family. Mrs. Harris
mentioned Rebecca's intentions, and learnt that there
was a country lady, then on a
visit
to this family, who had
parted with her maid, and was in want of one to
supply
her place. Rebecca thought
she
could venture to take
such
a
situation
in a regular quiet family. She was
introduced
to the Lady, who,
struck
with her lovely
person
and
modest
demeanour, conceived an
instant
prepossession
in her favour, and engaged her, upon liberal terms,
to enter her
service
on that day week.
Rebecca
selt
extremely happy that
she
should
no
longer
be a burden upon the kind Mrs. Harris, and eagerly
set
about preparing as well as the narrow
state
of her
finances
would allow, to take
possession
of her new place.
Mrs. Barton (the name of Rebecca's
mistress
) was a
pleasing
lively brunette, about twenty years old. She
had married, when very young, contrary to the advice
of her friends, a young man of
small
fortune and rather
flightly character, but
she
had twenty
thousand
pounds
at her own
disposal
, and her motto was, All for love.
Barton was really attached to her in the
first
years of
their marriage, but his temper was too
versatile
to belong
E 3
constant
to any thing, he in time grew cool, and often
played her
false
, but
she
was of
such
an even, cheerful,
unsuspecting
temper,
so
unaffectedly tender,
so
attentive
to his
interest
, and
studious
of his peace, that he found
it
impossible
to treat her with
unkindness
,
so
that there
was always an appearance of much cordiality between
them, for though
she
could not
shut
her eyes and ears
upon his infidelities,
she
wisely
concluded it was prudent
sometimes
to be wilfully deaf and blind, and that if good
humour would not reclaim him, ill humour would
certainly
make him
worse
.
With this couple Rebecca went into
Shropshire
, a few
weeks after
she
entered Mrs. Barton's
service
. Their
house
was a venerable gothic building,
situated
in the
midst
of a beautiful park, and had fallen to Mrs.
Barton
on the death of her godfather, from whom
also
she
inherited her independent fortune. Rebecca found
herself
much at her
ease
, Mrs. Barton was very kind to her,
and finding
she
possessed
an intelligent mind, often made
her the companion of her rambles about the grounds and
adjacent country. Mr. Barton troubled his lady but
little
with his company, except at meals, and
sometimes
not
then: nay, he even went
so
far as to
sleep
from home
several
nights in the week; and this being a liberty he had
never before taken, without his wife being informed of
the
cause
,
she
felt
herself
really
uncasy
, and, though
when he was
present
she
assumed
her
usual
cheerfulness
,
it was
impossible
to conquer her feelings,
so
as not to
let her chagrin and mortification appear to Rebecca,
who
sincerely
pitied, and by every affiduity in her
power
,
endeavoured to
amuse
and entertain her. Mrs.
Barton
kept but little company;
she
was fond of reading,
drawing,
music
, and fancy works; in
these
she
discovered
Rebecca's
taste
and knowledge, and many was the
heavy hour
she
beguiled in joining the labours of her
lady
,
improving her judgment, and with the
sweetest
diffidence
and humility correcting her errors.
In the mean time Lord
Ossiter
provoked beyond
measure
, that a
scheme
he had imagined infallible,
should
have proved totally abortive,
dispatched
his
faithful
valet off to
Lincolnshire
, in hopes to find the fair
fugitive there, and get her once more into his power;
but here he was again foiled; for though Rebecca had
wrote to her mother, that
she
had engaged with a Mrs.
Barton, yet
she
had not mentioned in what part of the
country the family
usually
resided
,
so
that the faithful
ambassador
returned to his
disappointed
Lord without
the
least
conciliatory intelligence.
CHAP. XXII.
SCHOOL FOR WIVES.
The
visits
of Barton from home became now too
long and too frequently repeated not to give his
wife
serious
cause
for
uneasiness
;
she
secretly
resolved
to
discover
, if
possible
, to whom he devoted
so
large a
portion of his time.
Now it
so
happened, that about
seven
miles from
Belle Park, on the
side
of a craggy hill, watered by an
impetuous
stream
, that
rushed
from the upper part of
the declivity,
stood
an old mill, and by the
side
of the
mill
stood
an old thatched cottage, within which lived
an old couple, who had a very young and a very lovely
grand daughter. Now, though this old man was the
owner of the mill and cottage, and ground many a
bushel
of corn for his poor neighbours, of which he never
failed
to take his regular toll; yet it
so
happened that he
was but poor
himself
. The cottage, we have
said
, was
old,
so
that the chilling
blasts
of winter, and the
scorching
heats of
summer
found
easy
entrance through its
shattered
frame; but Dolly, the blooming Dolly, was
the pride of their hearts, and often as they
sat
smoaking
their evening's pipe, they would gaze on her
sparkling
E 4
black eyes, ruddy complexion, and delicate
shape
,
and cry, Ah,
surely
that girl is born to be the comfort
of our old age;
she
is
so
handsome
, there is no doubt
but
she
will get a
squire
for a
husband
, or, mayhap,
the Lord of the Manor. Ah,
bless
the dear face of it,
I
shall
live to
see
her a great lady I warrant, and then it
will
send
some
people to mend old grandad's cottage,
and repair the crazy old mill.
These
were the waking
dreams of doating age, for alas Dolly had reached her
seventeenth
year and no
squire
had yet made his
appearance
,
to verify her grandmother's prophecy.
However
about this time one of Mr. Barton's footmen, a
smart
lad, about nineteen years old,
saw
this paragon of
rustic
beauty at a neighbouring fair, and, unfortunately
for his
master
's
horses
, from that day whenever he was
dispatched
to the neighbouring town or villages, on
messages
, errands, or what not, he always found the old
miller's cottage lay directly in the way between Belle
Park and the place to which he was
dispatched
.
One evening Mr. Barton having mounted his
horse
,
and called Thomas to attend him in his intended
excursion
,
being undetermined which way to go,
asked
the
lad if he had
discovered
lately any new ride, for, he
said
, I have gone the old track
so
often I am weary of
it. Thomas, full of the charms of Dolly, and eager to
embrance the
smallest
opportunity of beholding them, or
at
least
the cottage that contained them,
asked
his
master
if he had ever rode by Gaffer
Jobson
's mill.
'Tis not above
seven
miles off, your honour, and is
the
sweetest
and
romanticest
kind of a place, with trees
and rocks and a river: then the mill is
so
old, your
honour
,
that it looks, for all the world, like the places we
read about in
story
books.
Barton
smiled
, and being directed by Thomas as to
the road he was to take, cantered off, followed by the
happy lover, exulting in the thought of
seeing
his
mistress
,
though it were but for a moment. But, perhaps,
thought he,
master
may look at the place, and then I
can
slip
in for a minute, and
just
speak
to Dolly.
Alas poor Thomas thou art as blind as many other
wise
politicians, or thou
wouldst
never have taken thy
master
to
see
the cottage and the mill.
The
sun
was beginning to withdraw
itself
behind the
hill tops, when Gaffer having lighted his pipe and
Gammor
set
by her wheel, had
seated
themselves
on the
steps
of their cottage, to talk over old times, and dream, as
usual
, of Dolly's good fortune. Dolly had
just
tied on
a clean coloured apron,
smoothed
back her luxuriant
chesnut
hair, and
seated
beneath a tree not far
distant
from the door, was
earnestly
contriving to
dispose
to the
best
advantage three yards of cherry-coloured ribbon
which Thomas had given her, round a chip hat, in
which
she
thought to
outshine
all her companions the
next Sunday at church. Lifting her eyes from this
very
interesting
employment, who
should
she
see
but
the identical Mr. Thomas and a fine young gentleman
riding towards the mill.
Up
she
bounced. See,
see
, grandad,
said
she
,
eagerly,
see
you fine gentleman and Mr. Thomas.
She
spoke
loud, the evening was
serene
; her voice
vibrated on the ear of Barton; he turned his head, the
old mill, the trees, and rocks were no longer
interesting
objects. I will have a little chat with the old man,
said
he, guiding his
horse
that way, but his eyes were
fixed on the lovely form of Dolly. He chatted with
the old couple till it was nearly dark, and as he rode
homeward could think only on the charms of their
grand-daughter. The next evening he rode that way
again, unattended, talked
something
about repairing
the mill, and
kissed
Dolly at parting. Another and
another interview
succeeded
. Thomas was
constantly
kept employed at home, and a few guineas, a new
gown, and two or three glittering gewgaws had the
power to
banish
him as entirely from Dolly's memory
as though he had never held a place there. The
squire
,
as
she
called him, occupied all her thought, and,
awell-a-day
for poor nature, the
squire
triumphed over all
the virtue Dolly ever
possessed
. The old folks too
wilfully
shut
their eyes, and in
listening
to projected
repairs
,
and thinking of future
prosperity
, forgot it was
to be
purchased
by the infamy of their grand-daughter.
But Barton was by no means a liberal lover; he
talked much but performed little, and though he
slept
several
nights in a week at Gaffer
Jobson
's, he was
content to
sleep
on their homely
mattrass
, nor once
thought of providing another.
Poor Thomas, mortified to the
soul
, could not
conceal
his vexation, nor did he make a
secret
of the
cause
among his fellow
servants
. It was
whispered
from one
to another, till at length it reached Mrs. Barton; not
from Rebecca, for
she
would not have told
such
a tale
to a
distressed
wife, to obtain the
highest
consideration
;
she
would have feared the effect it would have had on her
feelings, and agonized with the poor
sufferer
in idea a
thousand
times. But Mrs. Barton was a woman of
spirit
;
she
felt her
husband
's neglect
severely
, but
she
would
more
severely
have felt the pity of her
servants
:
she
took
great care therefore not to appear to need it.
Do you know child,
said
she
to Rebecca, one day
as
she
was
assisting
her to
dress
; do you know, child,
that this truant
husband
of mine is fallen in love with
some
chubby faced little chit in the neighbourhood, and
prefers the company of her and her ignorant relations to
my elegant
society
, and their hard bed and
coarse
sheets
to his own made of down and covered with the
finest
holland: do you not think the man is turned fool?
She
said
this with
such
a
smile
of good humour that
Rebecca looked ar her with amazement, and
hesitatingly
replied, he is certainly blind to his own
happiness
,
Madam.
Oh, no; I dare
say
the indulgence of
these
whims
constitutes
what he calls
happiness
, but I
must
confess
he
seems
totally indifferent about mine, and as that is
the
case
, I
shall
take what
steps
I think proper to
secure
some
for
myself
. Now I have a
vast
desire
to
see
this
irresistable
lass
of the mill, and as I know he dines at
Mr. Thornhill's to day, this very afternoon I will pay
her a
visit
and you
shall
accompany me.
Rebecca thought this an odd
step
, but
she
had a very
high opinion of Mrs. Barton's
sense
and prudence, and
therefore prepared to attend her without intimating the
least
disapprobation
of the
scheme
, which
she
certainly
would have ventured to do, had
she
not been
satisfied
that her lady had
some
very good
reasons
for her conduct.
About four o'clock they
stepped
into the chariot,
and proceeded to the mill without any attendant. They
left the carriage within a quarter of a mile of the
cottage
,
and went thither on foot, pretended
weariness
, and
asked
leave to
rest
and have a draught of water. Would
you like a little wine in your water, my Lady,
said
the
old woman.
I
should
have hardly
supposed
, replied Mrs.
Barton
,
that your cottage afforded
such
a luxury.
Why, in good truth, we ne'er had
such
a thing
before
,
and now Gaffer and I don't much care for drinking
a'nt, we'd rather have a cup of yale; but the
squire
that
courts our Dolly
sent
some
that he may have a little now
and then when he comes.
Your daughter is going to be married then.
'Tis my grand-daughter, my Lady,
said
the old
woman,
courtesying
. At that moment the back door
opened and in bounced Dolly. She
blushed
,
courtesyed
awkwardly, and would have
spoke
but was at a
loss
what
to
say
. Prepared as Mrs. Barton was to
see
something
extremely lovely, the charms of this little
rustic
surpassed
her imagination. What a lovely creature,
said
she
,
softly
, to Rebecca; how could Barton be
so
wantonly
cruel as to contaminate the
soul
which animates this
beauteous form. The tears
started
in her eyes as
she
spoke
, but
brushed
them away unperceived. And
so
my dear you are going to be married, I
understand
, and
to a
squire
. I have
some
idea he is a friend of mine. I
believe he
spends
much of his time here, but I think
your accommodations are not very brilliant. You
must
give me leave to
send
you
some
better furniture, and to
give orders to have your
house
repaired; and
should
your lover inquire who it was ordered
these
things, tell
him it was a lady who has a great regard for him, and
lives at the old
fashioned
house
in the park.
Manifold were the
courtesys
and awkward
acknowledgments
poured forth by the grand-mother and
Dolly
,
but Mrs. Barton imagined
she
saw
in the
countenance
of the latter mingled
shame
and regret. If
we could
save
this poor girl,
said
she
to Rebecca,
when they were
seated
again in the carriage; if we
could
save
her and teach her the value of the gem
she
has
unconsciously
thrown away, we might then lead her
back to virtue, and,
spite
of her errors,
she
may yet
become a valuable member of
society
.
The carriage drove to the
nearest
town, when Mrs.
Barton went to an
upholsterer
's and ordered whatever
she
thought
necessary
, to be taken immediately to the
cottage;
she
likewise
engaged a carpenter to
send
people
the next day, to begin the repairs, and on returning
home
she
dispatched
a large bundle of
sheets
, table
linen
,
&c. by a poor labourer who knew nothing of the
reports current in the family. Rebecca
easily
saw
her
Lady's
design
, and
almost
trembled for the event,
indeed
Mrs. Barton
herself
could
scarcely
have been
less
agitated. That night Barton returned late, and having
a large party to dine next day, it was
impossible
for
him to
visit
his fair Dulcinea till the
ensuing
morning,
and then,
just
as he was going, a gentleman arrived
from town and detained him till after dinner.
I
shall
not be at home to-night,
Betsey
,
said
he,
as he mounted his
horse
; I have an engagement with
two or three jovial fellows, and
shall
not like to ride
home late.
Mrs. Barton
smiled
, I
wish
you a
pleasant
evening,
said
she
, and as I am
sure
of your being out of the
way I will
send
for my gallant.
You threaten well
Betsey
, but I have too good an
opinion of you to fear their execution.
Tea and
supper
was
served
without Mrs. Barton
being any the better for them;
she
became violently
agitated; Rebecca was
summoned
to attend her, but
alas Rebecca could not comfort her. The clock had
just
struck
eleven when the bell at the great gate was
rung with violence.
He is returned,
said
she
, and a few minutes
will now decide my fate. My good Rebecca leave me.
Barton entered the room with the looks of a
condemned
criminal.
Betsey
,
said
he, where were
you the day before
yesterday
, and how did you employ
your time?
Not in a manner
disagreeable
to you, I hope,
said
she
, mildly; I had heard how partial you were
to
sleeping
at the mill cottage, and I took a ride to
see
if you were well accommodated; but I found the bed
intolerable, and the
house
in
such
a
miserable
slate
I
thought you ran great
risques
of getting cold,
so
, being
unwilling to
lose
you, I thought it was my duty, as a
good wife, to provide you with better conveniences.
My dear
Betsey
how can you talk thus calm,
when you know all my
weakness
when you know how
I have injured you?
Barton,
said
she
, with a firm look and voice, I
am not now to learn that I am no longer beloved; but
it was no
reason
because
you had grown weary of home,
you
should
trifle away your life by
sleeping
in a place
almost
entirely open to nightly dews, and
unsheltered
even by curtains to your bed. But mark me, my dear
Barton, that I love you, I
trust
you have had
innumerable
incontestable
proofs; but if I am no longer beloved,
if my
society
and endearments can no longer give you
pleasure
, let us part; why
should
you deprive
yourself
of
the comforts and conveniences of life; let our fortune be
divided; leave me to
solitude
and quiet in this place, and
take your favourite to the Elms. But I charge you,
Barton delay not a day to make her a proper
settlement
,
left you hereafter grow weary of her, and fall a victim to
poverty and infamy: is a beauteous flower, pity it is
she
was ever
transplanted
into the garden of folly.
Betsey
,
said
he, dropping on his knees before her,
and taking both her hands,
Betsey
, you are an angel,
and I am totally unworthy your
forgiveness
: I
see
my
doom, I
see
my folly has
banished
all the
tenderness
of
your heart, and you
wish
to be
separated
from a wretch
who has treated you
so
unworthily.
You are
mistaken
, Barton, if you think I
wish
to be
separated
from you, could I once more be the
mistress
of your affections; to live with you, to love you, to
promote
your
happiness
would be the
pleasure
of my life,
but I cannot have a divided heart; if another is
preferred
,
let me not, by
constantly
witnessing
your
indifference
toward
myself
,
suffer
pains too acute to be borne
without complaining.
Oh
Betsey
!
dearest
girl, forgive me, and take my
whole, my undivided heart; do with it what you
please
,
it never
shall
again wander from you, its
chosen
mistress
.
Mrs. Barton could no longer combat the
impulse
of
her throbbing heart,
she
dropped her head on the
forehead
of her repentant
husband
, and tears of
unseigned
joy
ratified their reconciliation.
But what
must
we do with poor Dolly,
said
she
,
after a
pause
of a few moments.
I commit her to your care, my love, replied
Barton
,
sensible
that you will do whatever is
best
for her
future well doing,for my part, I will never
see
her
again.
Nay, Barton, keep your
passions
under the
guidance
of
reason
, and you may
see
her without danger.
CHAP. XXIV.
THE VOYAGE.
Mrs.
Barton let no time
elapse
in merely forming
plans for Dolly. She took an opportunity to
found Thomas's
sentiments
concerning her, and found
the poor lad as deeply in love as ever; And would you
be willing to marry her, Thomas, provided the mill was
repaired and
she
had a few acres of ground well
stocked
?
Thomas replied in the affirmative, and Dolly being
found no ways unwilling to comply, a few weeks made
them man and wife; Barton
desiring
his Lady to
spare
no expence
necessary
to make them quite comfortable,
and literally kept his
promise
of never
seeing
Dolly
again.
But though his
resolves
, in regard to future
constancy
were
seriously
made, his heart was
composed
of
such
inflammable matter, that he no
sooner
began to
contemplate
the
unassuming
charms of Rebecca, which, from
being much at home, he had now
sufficient
leisure
to do,
than he found
himself
puzzled to keep his good
resolutions
;
and being
unaccustomed
to combat his
inclinations
,
he found this
first
attempt at
self
-
conquest
too
painful to be
persevered
in: and Mrs. Barton, with
anguish
of heart,
saw
he was again
relapsing
into
indifference
and
inconstancy
.
Rebecca too
saw
, with evident
displeasure
, the many
opportunities he took of throwing
himself
in her way.
It was
sometimes
impossible
to avoid
listening
to him on
a
subject
which filled her with
disgust
and
sorrow
. He
offered her
several
valuable trinkets, which
she
resolutely
refused
to accept; but at length his behaviour became
so
unequivocal, that Rebecca determined to quit her
amiable
mistress
, however unwilling to
relinquish
a
situation
in which
she
had enjoyed
so
much tranquillity.
Mrs. Barton quickly
discovered
the motives of our
heroine's intention, and honoured her for them.
You are a truly amiable girl, Rebecca,
said
she
,
and I will not part with you till I can recommend
you to
some
person
who will be
sensible
of your value.
The next morning Mrs. Barton informed her that,
during a
visit
she
had made the preceding afternoon,
she
had heard of a
situation
which
she
thought might prove
highly advantageous to her. But perhaps,
continued
she
, you would not like to leave England.
All places are alike to me,
said
Rebecca; I have
so
very few friends who
interest
themselves
at all in my
welfare, that provided my mother gives her
assent
, I can
have no objection to quitting a place where every tie is
broken that once rendered it
most
dear to me.
Well then,
said
Mrs. Barton, there is a young
lady who has been in England for her education;
she
is
now about
sixteen
years old, of an amiable temper, and
highly
accomplished
. Her father, who
resides
in
America
,
has
sent
for her home, and her
governess
has been
inquiring for a prudent well educated young
person
to
accompany her. The terms offered are fifty guineas,
and all expences paid, and
should
you not approve
residing
there, on your arrival, they will pay your
passage
back again.
Colonel Abthorpe is a man of large fortune; he
has formerly
served
in the army, but at the
conclusion
of the war
resigned
his
commission
, and retired to
America
,
his lady being a native of that place.
Miss
Abthorpe
goes out in about fix weeks, and if you
should
like to accompany her, I have no doubt but you are the
kind of
person
that will
suit
her.
Rebecca was
pleased
with the
proposal
;
she
waited
on the lady with whom
Miss
Abthorpe had been
educated
,
and was highly approved of, both by her and
the young lady
herself
. She then wrote to her mother,
and in a few
posts
received a letter dictated by her
mother
,
but wrote by her
sister
-in-law, and written in
such
cold
slighting
terms that
she
easily
saw
they would be
glad to have her
so
far from them, that there might be
no danger of her coming home, in
case
of
sickness
or
other contingencies;
she
therefore took leave of the
amiable
Mrs. Barton, who could not part from her without
tears, and who
presented
her with
several
valuable
memorials
of her
friendship
.
The day after Rebecca entered
Miss
Abthorpe's
service
she
set
off for London, where
she
was to join Mr. Seward's
family, who were to embark on board the
same
ship
with her, and under
whose
protection
she
was to
proceed
to New-England. It was late in September when
they arrived in town, and a variety of incidents
detained
them till the middle of October,
so
that they had
but an untoward
prospect
before them, when
so
late in
the
season
they embarked at Deal, on board a brig
bound for
Boston
. A fair wind
presently
took them
out of the channel, and they flattered
themselves
with
a
prosperous
voyage; but
these
flattering appearances
were
soon
reversed
, for the wind
suddenly
changed,
rising
almost
to a hurricane,
so
that it was
impossible
to
pursue
their intended
course
or return to port, and they
continued
tossing
about in the Atlantic till the latter
end of December, and then had not half made their
passage
, though their
provision
was
so
exhausted
that
they were obliged to live on a very
small
allowance of
bread; water and
salt
meat they had, and a few
pease
,
but of
these
they were extremely careful.
Poor Rebecca heartily
wished
herself
on
shore
again,
but
sensible
those
wishes
were unavailing,
she
confined
them to her own
bosom
, and exerted
herself
to
support
the
spirits
of
Miss
Abthorpe, who, naturally delicate
and
unaccustomed
to fatigue, was nearly
exhausted
with
terror,
consinement
and hunger. In a few weeks they
were reduced
almost
to extremities; they had not even
a candle to light the binnacle, which contains the
compass
,
and the whole of their allowance now amounted to
one
biscuit
and half a pint of water per day each
person
.
Mr. Seward had on board the
ship
with him,
besides
two fine boys, the one fourteen the other twelve
years old, a charming little girl
scarcely
seven
. Mrs.
Seward had been dead
some
years, and the child was
accompanied by her
nurse
. The chief
anguish
this
faithful
servant
felt was in contemplating her little charge,
and thinking how
she
was to be
preserved
; indeed, to
such
a height did her affection
rise
, that
she
voluntarily
deprived
herself
of part of the very
small
portion of
bread allotted her, that
she
might lay it by
against
a
time of more eminent
necessity
for this darling of her
heart.
It was a clear cold day, the wind blowing
strongly
against
them, when the
master
of the
vessel
entered the
cabin with a
smile
. A
smile
at that particular time
was received by all as a good omen, for
seldom
had
such
a thing been
seen
in their melancholy party.
There is a
ship
bearing down towards us,
said
he.
I have made a
signal
of
distress
, and no doubt we
shall
be relieved.
Hope,
sweet
solace
of the wretched, played round
the hearts of his auditors as he pronounced
these
words; and all who were able crawled upon the deck
to watch, with eager eyes, the near approaches of the
expected relief. The
vessel
drew nigh, and the
master
enquired what was the matter.
We are in the
utmost
distress
,
said
Mr. Seward,
who took upon him to
answer
. We have been ten
weeks at
sea
, our
provisious
are
exhausted
, and we are
in danger of
starving
.
I am
sorry
for it, replied the
master
of the other
vessel
; but though we have a good wind now, we do
not know how
soon
it may change, and we may want
our
provisions
ourselves
.
It was in vain to attempt a reply; the
vessel
was again
put before the wind, and in a few moments the
intervening
billows, which
rose
to a tremendous height, hid her
from their view.
Silent and
sad
the
disheartened
mariners and
passengers
left the deck. Mr. Seward took his little girl in his
arms, his two boys hung on each
side
of him; he
endeavored
at a look of fortitude, but the
gushing
tears
betrayed the
anguish
of the paternal heart. Rebecca
seated
herself
on her bed,
Miss
Abthorpe looked up in
her face for comfort, but
she
had none to offer;
she
sighed
and
rested
her head on Rebecca's
shoulder
.
What
shall
we do,
said
she
, mournfully.
Trust
in God, replied Rebecca, faintly,
pressing
her hand.
Miss
Abthorpe returned the
pressure
, and they joined
in
servently
committing
themselves
to the protecting
care of him who could
save
to the
uttermost
.
Ten days more
passed
on in this dreadful manner,
when another
vessel
was
discovered
, but, alas! Hope
refused
to cheer their
bosoms
with the
faintest
ray.
We
must
make an attempt to move their
compassion
,
however,
said
the
master
. Mr. Seward
assented
to the
proposal
, and they mounted the deck together;
but Rebecca and her young lady
sat
pensive
and
silent
;
they hardly dared to hope, and the
sweet
comforts of
religion forbade them to
despair
.
The
noise
on the deck prevented their hearing what
was
said
, or whether any
answer
was returned to their
entreaties. In a few moments the
noise
increased
almost
to tumult, a
confused
shout
broke forth, which
the poor
listening
females
mistook
for a murmur of
horror
and
disappointment
.
They have
refused
us, cried
Miss
Abthorpe,
endeavouring
to
rise
from her bed.
I am afraid they have indeed,
said
Rebecca; but
do not you attempt to go on deck
stay
here and I
will go and enquire. With tremulous and unequal
steps
after repeated attempts, Rebecca reached the
gangway. She was
just
trying to mount the
steps
,
when her intent was
frustrated
by a
sudden
motion of
the
ship
, and
she
fell down. Heaven
preserve
me!
said
she
, as
she
slowly
arose
.
Heaven has
preserved
us all,
said
Mr. Seward,
as he
descended
the
steps
, for look, my good girl,
what a dinner its bounty has
sent
us.
At that moment a
strange
sailor
came down with a
large wooden bowl, in which was a fine piece of boiled
beef,
some
potatoes, and a
pease
pudding.
God
bless
your pretty hearts,
said
the
sailor
,
looking
round at Rebecca,
Miss
Abthorpe, and the young
Sewards, come fall too and lay in a good cargo for
according to the log your are light enough now.,
You have robbed
yourselves
, I fear,
said
Rebecca
;
this was intended for your dinners.
That is neither here nor there,
said
he,
putting
a large quid of tobacco in his mouth; and
split
my
topsails
if I would not rather rob
myself
any time
than
see
a brother
sailor
want a dinner. D  e
we
soon
emptied the copper when we heard how
close
hauled you were, and
set
old
stoke
gally to work to
cook more; we brought enough for all, and they have
fallen too above board like a parcel of hungry
sharks
.
Oh ye
sons
and daughters of luxury
whose
tables are
covered with the
most
costly
viands, and who turn
from them
dissatisfied
and unthankful, could you feel
for a moment the
ecstasy
that pervaded the hearts of the
poor weary
famished
mariners who now were
partaking
the
provision
their charitable brethren had brought
them, you would henceforward
justly
conceive the
happiness
of your own lot, and bow with gratitude to the
Divine
dispenser
of all
blessings
.
The freindly
sailors
now departed, having taken an
inventory of what was
most
requisite
for the releif of
their brethern, and in about an hour and a half returned
with their captain, and a
supply
of bread,
cheese
, meat,
butter, and candles,
also
a
small
quantity of
spirituous
liquors to
refresh
the
sailors
.
We
must
give you a bill on the owners,
said
Mr.
Seward, when he had taken an account of the
stores
brought on board.
No, replied the generous captain, I
shall
take
no bill. I expect no reward. I may one day be in the
same
situation
, and have only done as I would be done
by.
[1]
[1]
This
apostrophe
is the genuine emotion of gratitude, the author
having in a
situation
similar
to the one
described
here, experienced
relief
bestowed
in the
same
disinterested
manner.
Exalted humanity, noble,
disinterested
sailor
, may
you ever experience from your fellow creatures the
same
benevolence that expands and elevates your own heart.
May your days be many and your
prosperity
equal to
your
deserts
.
Having taken a grateful leave of their benefactor,
they, with renovated
spirits
,
pursued
their voyage, and
the wind changing in the
course
of a few days, drove
them rapidly towards their
desired
haven,
so
that on
the twenty eighth of January, about two in the
afternoon
,
they heard the joyful
sound
of Land a head.
The port of
Boston
is
situated
in
such
a manner, that,
after having made land,
six
or
seven
hours good
sailing
will take a
vessel
into
safe
harbour,
so
that our weary
voyagers began to think of landing that evening,
however
late it might be when they arrived; but as the night
came on, the wind
increased
, accompanied by
snow
and
sleet
; the cold at the
same
time being
intense
, it
frose
as it fell, and in a very
short
period the ropes about the
ship
were
so
incased
with ice, that they became
immoveable
;
the
darkness
increased
, and to add to their
distress
, they
lost
sight
of the light
house
at the entrance
of the harbour.
Their
situation
was now imminently dangerous:
driving
before the wind, among a multitude of rocks and
breakers, without the
least
chance of avoiding them:
to be
shipwrecked
in the very
sight
of home, was a
painful trial indeed, yet this was what all expected, and
for which all endeavoured to prepare
themselves
with
patient
resignation
.
About ten o'clock all their fears were realized, and a
sudden
shock
convinced them they had
struck
on
some
rocks. The
ensuing
scene
from that time till
seven
the
next morning is better imagined than
described
, for till
that time they had no
prospect
of relief, but continued
beating on the rocks, the waves
washing
over them,
and expecting momentary
dissolution
. As the day-light
advanced they
discovered
the
island
from which the reef
ran, to be inhabited
[2]
[2]
Lovel's
Island
.
. Several
muskets
were
immediately
discharged
, and
signals
hung out, and about eight
o'clock they
discovered
people coming to their
assistance
.
It was
impossible
to bring a boat near the
vessel
, but the
tide beginning to leave her, the men waded into the
water
,
and placed a ladder
against
her
side
, down which
the fear of immediate death gave
Miss
Abthrope and
Rebecca courage to
descend
; but what were the
feelings
of Mr. Seward, when he found the
impossibility
of
his little daughter's going down,
so
dangerous was it
rendered by the ice that enveloped the
steps
of the
ladder
,
and from whence, if
she
fell,
she
must
have been
dashed
to pieces or
lost
among the rocks; nor did he
dare to venture to
descend
himself
with her in his arms,
lest
a
false
step
or
slip
might
destroy
them both. But
there was no time for much deliberation, as it was
absolutely
necessary
to leave the
ship
before the tide returned.
At length an old
sailor
offered an expedient which was
thought
feaseable
; and the agitated parent
fastened
a
strong
cord round the
waist
of his child, by which he
lowered her down the
side
of the
vessel
; the old
sailor
caught her in his arms, and bore her exultingly to the
shore
.
A new world now opened on Rebecca, who, when
she
was a little recovered, beheld with
astonishment
how
every object was bound in the frigid chains of winter.
The harbour, which
she
could
see
from the
house
on the
island
, was one continued
sheet
of ice. The face of the
country was entirely covered with
snow
, and from the
appearance of all around
she
could form no probable
hope of getting to Colonel Abthorpe's till the genial
influence
of
spring
should
unbind their fetters; but in this
she
was agreeably
mistaken
, for the inhabitants of
those
cold climates being
accustomed
to the weather, were
quick in expedients to facilitate their conveyance from
one place to another. The very next morning a boat
was procured, and men being placed at the head, to
break the ice as they proceeded. By two o'clock, on
the thirtieth of January, our heroine found
herself
once
more on terra firma, comfortably
seated
before a large
wood fire, in Colonel Abthorpe's parlour; for during
their voyage
Miss
Abthurpe had conceived
such
an
esteem
for her, that
she
insisted
on her being
considered
as her friend and
sister
, and her parents had too high a
respect
for their daughter, to
wish
to contradict
so
laudable
a
desire
.
CHAP. XXIII.
ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ATLANTIC.
On
the left hand of the entrance of
Boston
harbour
is a beautiful little
peninsula
, called N; it
consists
of two gradually
rising
hills, beautifully
diversified
with orchards, corn-fields and
pasture
land. In the
valley is built a little village,
consisting
of about fifty
houses
, the inhabitants of which could
just
make
shift
to
decently
support
a
minister
, who on a Sunday
ascended
the pulpit in a
rustic
temple,
situated
by the
side
of a
large piece of water, nearly in the middle of the village,
and taught, to the
utmost
of his abilities, the true
principles
of
christianity
. The neck of land which joins this
peninsula
to the main is extremely narrow, and indeed is
sometimes
almost
overflown by the tide. On one
side
it
forms a charmingly
picturesque
harbour, in which are a
variety of
small
but delightfully fertile
islands
, and on the
other it is
washed
by the ocean, to which it lays open.
In this enchanting village
stood
Mr. Abthorpe's
house
,
in the
midst
of a neat and well cultivated garden; and
here it was that, as the
spring
advanced, our
contemplative
heroine beheld with rapture the rapid
progress
of
the infant vegitation; for the earth
seemed
hardly
releafed
from the fleecy garb of winter, before it
burst
forth
in the full bloom of vernal pride.
In this agreeable
situation
Rebecca remained nearly
two years, enjoying as much felicity as
she
could expect
in the
friendship
of Mr. and Mrs. Abthorpe and the
affection of their amiable daughter. It is true
she
sometimes
sighed
when
she
thought of Sir George Worthy
sometimes
gazed on his portrait and that of his mother's,
till her eyes overflowing could no longer
distinguish
them. But
these
were luxuries, too dangerous to be
often
indulged, they only
served
to enervate her mind, and
render her incapable of enjoying the
blessings
placed
within her reach, and led her to repine at the wife
difpensations
of Providence;
she
therefore exerted her
natural
good
sense
to keep
these
acute
sensibilities
within
proper
restrictions
, and by
striving
to be happy in her
present
situation
, in a great
measure
rendered
herself
really
so
. She had many admirers, and might have
entered
into matrimonial engagements greatly to her
advantage
,
but
she
resolutely
resused
them all,
still
maintaining
towards each that invariable
politeness
and
frankness
of demeanor, as at the
same
moment
extinguished
their tenderer hopes and yet conciliated their
esteem
.
In the
course
of this time
she
had received two letters
from Mrs. Barton, and one from her mother; the
former
informed her, that her
husband
was entirely
reclaimed
,
that
she
was the
happiest
woman in the creation, and
that
she
hoped
she
should
one day have Rebecca a
witness
to her felicity; the contents of the latter was
not
so
pleasing
; her mother complained of ill treatment
from her daughter-in-law, and extravagance in her
husband
;
at the
same
time
she
informed her,
she
had
just
lain in of a boy, who
she
hoped would be the comfort of
her old age.
I
wish
to heaven he may,
said
Rebecca, then
laying
down the letter and reflecting how many leagues
she
was from her only
surviving
parent; that perhaps
she
might be in heavy affliction, ill treated by
those
on
whom
she
had placed the
firmest
reliance, laughed at by
the world, and not unlikely pinched by poverty. The
gentle-hearted girl
burst
into tears; Ah!
said
she
,
why did I leave my native country; I
should
have
remembered
that my poor mother had no real friend but
me, on whom
she
could
safely
rely for comfort in
sickness
or affliction; I
should
have remembered, that though
she
had preferred the
friendship
of others to mine, it
was
still
my duty not to leave her
exposed
to
misfortunes
which my
presence
and tender
assiduties
might
have alleviated.
About this time the unhappy breach between Great
Britain and her colonies
arose
to
such
a height, that it
never could be healed, and war, in her
most
frightful
shape
, began to
stalk
over this once happy land. Ere
this, the inhabitants of New-England, by their
hospitality
and primitive
simplicity
of manners, revived in the
mind of our heroine the golden age,
so
celebrated by
poets. Here were no locks or bolts required, for each
one, content with his own cot, coveted not the
possessions
of his neighbour; here
should
a
stranger
make his
appearance in their little village, though unknown by
all, every one was eager to
shew
him the
most
civility,
inviting him to their
houses
, and treating him with
every
delicacy the
simplicity
of their manner of living
afforded
.
The only
house
of entertainment in this village, had
scarcely
custom
sufficient
to
supply
its venerable
mistress
with the
necessaries
of life; but
she
had a garden, a
cow, and a few acres of land; the produce of
these
were
sufficient
to her wants and
wishes
, and
she
would
sit
in her matted arm chair, in a room
whose
only
beauty
was the white-
washed
wall, the nicely
sanded
floor, while the
smile
of content played about her
face, and while
she
thankfully enjoyed the bounties of
heaven,
she
remembered not that any could be richer
or happier than
herself
.
But when fell
discord
spread
her
sable
pinions and
shook
her curling
snakes
, how
soon
this
blisssul
prospect
was
reversed
; frighted at the horrid din of arms,
hospitality
fled her once favourite abode, mutual confidence
was no more, and fraternal love gave place to
jealousy
,
diffension
, and blind party zeal. The
son
raised
his
unhallowed
arm
against
his parent, brothers drenched their
weapons in each other's blood, and all was horror and
confusion
. The terrified inhabitants of N left
the village and took refuge in the more interior parts
of the country, all but Colonel Abthorpe's family, who
still
remained, though
deserted
by all their
servants
;
for the Colonel had too high a regard for his royal
master
to join the
cause
of his enemies, and it was
impossible
to join the
British
troops without
relinquishing
all his property; he therefore hoped the
storm
would
soon
pass
over; that
some
method would be
proposed
F
and accepted to conciliate matters, and in the mean
time he
wished
to remain neuter.
It was a
still
morning about the latter end of July,
when Rebecca, being
disturbed
by
some
little
rustling
at her window,
raised
her head, and by the
saint
dawn
that
just
glimmered from the
east
,
discovered
armed
men placed round the
house
. Alarmed,
she
started
from her bed and awoke
Miss
Abthorpe; they threw a
few clothes over them and flew to the Colonel's
apartment
.
They were met by Mrs. Abthorpe, who caught
her daughter in her arms, and, pointing to the room
where they
usually
slept
, cried, Look Sophia, your
poor father.
Miss
Abthorpe looked and beheld two
soldiers
with
firelocks, who placed at the door of the apartment, held
her father a
prisoner
.
Ah, my dear mother,
said
she
, who are
these
,
and what are they going to do;
surely
,
surely
they will
not murder us.
Don't frighten
yourself
,
Miss
,
said
one of the
officers, we do not
usually
murder
such
pretty girls.
But my father, cried
she
, eagerly, what do you
intend to do with him.
Set him at liberty again when our expedition is
over.
Rebecca now learnt that
these
were a part of the
American army, who had come to N in
whaleboats
,
with a
design
of dragging their boats
across
the
beach before mentioned, and proceeding to the light
house
at the entrance of the harbour, intending to
destroy
it,
in order to
mislead
the expected relief that was coming
to
Boston
which was at that time blockaded: they had
before made an
unsuccessful
attempt to
demolish
this
light-
house
, and were now come
resolved
not to leave
their work
unfinished
; accordingly they proceeded as
quiet as
possible
to the beach,
almost
carried their boats
over, and arrived totally unexpected at the little
island
on which the light-
house
stood
, and which was guarded
by a party of marines. A
smart
skirmish
ensued
, but
the Americans were too numerous to be
withstood
by
so
small
a party; the whole of which they either killed or
took
prisoners
; and having completed their
design
,
returned
to N, victorious, though in the
utmost
consternation
, for fear of being
pursued
by boats from
the Lively frigate, and other
ships
that lay in the harbour.
Rebecca was
standing
at a window as they relanded,
the tears
streaming
down her pale face, and
so
entirely
absorbed
in terror that
she
was inattentive to the
surrounding
objects. From this
state
of torpor
she
was
aroused
by a deep groan, and
raising
her eyes,
saw
two
Americans entering the
house
, bearing between them a
wounded marine, whom they laid on the floor, and
were preparing to depart, when Mrs. Abthorpe
rushed
out of the adjoining apartment.
What are you doing?
said
she
, you will not
surely
leave him here.
`Dn him, cried a wretch, he is in our way;
if he don't die quickly we will kill him.
Oh, do not kill me!
said
the
almost
expiring
soldier
;
I am not fit to die.
At this moment Major Tupper entered: Mrs.
Abthorpe
addressed
him in a
supplicating
accent; We
can procure the poor
soul
no
affistance
,
said
she
; he
will
perish
for want of proper applications to
stanch
the
blood.
My dear madam,
said
the Major, what can we
do; we fear
pursuit
, and
must
retreat as
fast
as
possible
,
and
should
we take him with us, in our hurry and
confusion
he will perhaps be precipitated into eternity. If
we make a
safe
retreat I will
send
to morrow. He
then departed, and Colonel Abthorpe being now at
liberty
,
turned his thoughts toward the wounded
soldier
.
He had fainted, a
mattress
was laid on the ground,
and as they all united in endeavouring to remove him
upon it, the motion
increased
the
anguish
of his wounds,
and recalled his languid
senses
.
Oh, Spare me! do not kill me!
said
he looking
round with a terrified
aspect
.
Be comforted,
said
the colonel; you are among
friends, who will do all in their power to
save
your life.
F 2
God will reward you,
said
he, faintly.
They now examined the wound, and found, from its
depth and
situation
, that a few hours would terminate
the
existence
of the poor
sufferer
: however they made
long bandages of linen, and with pledgets dipped in
spirits
,
endeavoured to
stanch
the bleeding, but in vain.
I am very faint,
said
he.
Rebecca knelt and
supported
him in her arms,
assisted
by the weeping Sophia.
Can I live, think you, Sir?
said
he, looking
wishfully
in the Colonel's face.
I fear not, was the reply.
God's will be done,
said
he; but I have a long
account to
settle
, and but a
short
time to do it in.
Dear good
Christians
, pray with mepray for me.
Alas, it is an awful thing to die, and with the weight
of murder on my
conscience
. Here he grew faint
again and
ceased
to
speak
. A cordial was
administered
he revived.
You
see
before you, my kind friends,
said
he
a
most
unhappy man, the victim of his own folly.
My father is a clergyman in the North of England; I am
his only child, and have received from him an education
suitable
to the
station
in which he meant to have placed
me, which was the church; but, alas, I
despised
his
precepts
,
and joined
myself
to a
set
of the
most
dissolute
companions, with whom I ran into every
species
of vice
and debauchery. By repeated extravagance I involved
my poor father, who, no longer able to
supply
my
exhorbitant
demands,
remonstrated
against
my way of life;
but I was too much attached to vice to
resolve
to quit
it, and in a fit of
desperation
, having
lost
more money
than I could pay, I
enlisted
into a regiment bound for
this place. Ah, Sir, I have
reason
to think my
conduct
shortened
the period of my dear mother's
existence
,
and I have embittered the
last
hours of a father whom
it was my duty to comfort and
support
.
These
are
heavy clogs upon my departing
soul
, but he who
witnesseth
the
sincerity
of my repentance, I
trust
will
compassonate
and pardon me.
No doubt of it, cried Rebecca,
whose
heart was
almost
bursting
as
she
listened
to the expiring penitent.
He looked round, and fixing his eyes on Rebecca and
Sophia, Poor girls,
said
he, you are but young,
take the advice of a dying
sinner
, and
treasure
it in
your memories: obey your parents, never
forsake
them,
and
shun
vicious company, for had I done this it would
have been well with me in this evil day.
Rebecca's
susceptible
heart
smote
her,
she
hid her
face with her handkerchief, and
sighed
deeply.
God for ever
bless
you, my friends,
said
he; I
am going, a few pangs more, and all will be over. Oh,
may he
whose
fatal aim took my life have it not
remembered
against
him; may the Father of mercy forgive him
as freely as I do.
He then began to repeat the Lord's Prayer, but
expired
before he could
finish
it.
Peace to his repentant
spirit
,
said
the Colonel, as
he
raised
his weeping daughter from her knees.
His poor father,
said
she
, what would he feel,
did he know this.
He felt more, replied the Colonel, when the
misguided
youth
forsook
the paths of virtue, than he would,
could he even behold him now.
The heat at this
season
of the year is
intense
, and the
Colonel knew the body of the unhappy
soldier
must
that day be
consigned
to the earth, yet how to make
the grave, or how to convey the
corpse
to it when made
were difficulties which he could hardly think it
possible
to
surmount
, but
sad
necessity
enforced the attempt;
he fixed on a retired
spot
,
just
by the
side
of his garden,
and began the melancholy
task
. Rebecca and Sophia
with their delicate hands endeavourd to
assist
, and by
evening they had completed it.
The faint rays of the
setting
sun
just
tinged the
summit
of the
highest
hill; the
sky
was
serene
, and
scarce
a breeze was heard to move the leaves or ruffle the
smooth
surface
of the water. Awfully
solemn
was the
silenet
that reigned through this once cheerful village.
F 3
As the Colonel
sat
pensively
considering
his
situation
,
and thinking how in the
decentest
manner
possible
he
could render the
last
sad
duties to the
deceased
, he
saw
a
small
fishing
boat, with one man in it, drawing near
the
shore
; he ran
hastily
down, entreated him to land
and
assist
him in his mournful office.
The body was carefully wrapped in a
sheet
it was
impossible
to obtain a coffin.
We have no clergyman,
said
the Colonel, but
the prayers of innocence
shall
consecrate
his grave.
He gave the prayer book to Sophia,
she
opened it,
and with her mother and Rebecca followed the body.
She began the
service
, but her voice faltered, the tears
burst
forth,
she
sobbed
, and could no longer articulate.
The Colonel took it from her; he was a man of
undaunted
courage in the day of battle, but here even his
heart
sunk
and his voice was tremulous; but he recalled
his fortitude and
finished
the
solemn
rite in a becoming
manner.
What a day has this been,
said
Sophia, as they
were partaking a little
refreshment
.
It has been a heavy day indeed my child,
said
Mrs. Abthorpe, but how much heavier would it have
been, had the poor departed been related to us by any
ties of blood: had he been a father, a
husband
, or a
brother. Think not of the evils we endure, my dear
Sophia, but reflect how much more painful our
situation
might be than it is, and offer up your thanks to your
Creator, that our afflictions do not exceed our
strength
,
and that in this
solitary
place we enjoy health and
serenity
of mind.
Ah,
said
Rebecca, mentally, I do not enjoy
that
serenity
, for my mother, in affliction, in want, and
calling in vain upon her daughter for comfort, is ever
present
to my imagination.
For
several
weeks the
solitude
of Colonel Abthorpe
was
undisturbed
, and Autumn began to advance. He
dreaded the approach of Winter, as he knew in that
inclement
season
they would feel the want of many
comforts
they had been
accustomed
to enjoy; and
shut
out
from all
society
, how
should
they procure
sustenance
.
These
reflections made him extremely unhappy. He
would gladly have gone to the
British
troops, but had
no
possible
means of conveying
himself
and family to
them, and his heart revolted from the thought of going to
reside
with the enemies of his
sovereign
; however they
gave him not the choice, for the latter end of October
they
dispatched
a party,
consisting
of a captain,
lieutenant
,
and fifty men, who
surrounded
the
house
of the
defenceless
Colonel, making
himself
, his wife,
daughter
,
and our heroine
prisoners
, on pretence of his having
held
correspondence
with the enemy. They were
conveyed
into the country, their
house
torn to pieces, their
furniture
destroyed
, burnt, or divided among the
soldiers
,
and all their property
confiscated
.
CHAP. XXV.
SUFFERING LOYALTY.
Mrs
. Abthorpe was a woman of delicate
constitution
.
This
sad
reverse
of fortune was more than
she
could well
support
; a
slow
nervous fever preyed upon
her frame; nor could the united efforts of her
husband
,
Sophia and Rebecca,
arouse
her from the
state
of
torpor and inaction into which
she
had fallen, cooped up
in one
single
room (for, though
prisoners
, they had the
liberty of walking about the place to which they been
conveyed) obliged to perform the
most
menial offices for
themselves
, with
scarcely
the
necessaries
, and none of
the comforts of life, except what was
supplied
from
some
few benevolent families who were friends to government.
It may be
easily
supposed
Col. Abthorpe and his
family
acutely felt their painful
situation
, yet he
endeavoured
to
supp
ort
himself
with a becoming fortitude.
Rebecca and her young Lady, in the
course
of a few
F 4
months, learned to manage their wheels, which they
plied with diligence and dexterity,
sometimes
spinning
cotton,
sometimes
wool or flax,
rising
with the
lark, and continuing their labours with unremitting
industry
,
till the
shades
of evening prevented their
pursuing
it. They would then, as the
progress
of the
spring
invited them, wander out to a neighbouring wood, the
borders of which were
washed
by a narrow arm of the
sea
; they would
sit
on its banks, watching the
unstable
element as it ebbed or flowed, and admiring the rich
beauties of the
surrounding
prospect
. Their hearts
were innocent. Youth, health and
exercise
, gave them
a flow of
spirits
, and often as they
sat
would they
warble
some
innocent cheerful air, or in an evening hymn
of
thanksgiving
, lift up their
souls
to their Creator.
But when the
summer
was
past
, and winter in its
dread array drew near, when the pinching
blasts
of
December
pierced bleakly through the crevices of their
miserable
habitation, and there was neither fire or
necessary
food to alleviate the horrors
inspired
by the
gloominess
of the
season
, then it was their
spirits
began to
flag. Sophia would gaze ardently at her mother, on
whose
pale countenance
sickness
and
sorrow
sat
triumphant
,
and while, with a faint
smile
of tender affection,
she
endeavoured to cheer her, the
starting
tear would
discover
the
despondency
of her own heart.
It was a cold evening, the
snow
fell
fast
, a very
smal
portion of fire glowed on the hearth, and the little light
in their apartment proceeded from a
small
lamp that
was placed on a deal table;
beside
which
sat
Colonel
Abthorpe, his head
rested
on his hand, his eyes fixed in
mournful contemplation on the altered face of his
beloved
wife, who,
seated
opposite
to him was diligently
employed in knitting, while Rebecca and Sophia were
in hopes, by the produce of their labours to
small
,
very
small
share
of comforts they
I have felt it colder, replied his Lady,
endeavouring
at a
smile
;
besides
the room is
small
, and a little
fire warms it.
To be
sure
, cried Sophia, and then, while I
am at work, I never think of the cold; but I am afraid
of Rebecca;
she
is more delicate than I am.
Your fears are
needless
, my love, replied our
heroine
.
I
should
not mind the inclemency of the
season
was your dear mother only comfortable.
We think our
situation
hard,'
said
Mrs. Abthorpe,
what then is the
situation
of the poor
soldiers
engaged
in the war?
Poor fellows,
said
the Colonel,
passing
his hand
across
his forehead, to conceal the rheum that
distilled
from his eyes.
At that moment the door of their apartment opened,
and a
stranger
entered without ceremony.
The Colonel
across
. Mrs. Abthorpe bowed her head
in token of
salutation
, and the young ladies
suspended
their work.
The
stranger
drew a chair. You do not
seem
to
be comfortably
situated
, Colonel,
said
he, as he
seated
himself
, and
cast
his eyes round the room.
No, replied the Colonel, with a deep drawn
sigh
,
comfort and I have long been
strangers
to each other.
Mrs. Abthorpe looks ill,
said
the
stranger
; has
she
had any advice?
The humanity of
some
friends, Sir, have procured
her every medical
assistance
; but, alas! in vainthe
malady is
seated
in her mind.
I was enquiring about you the other day,
said
the
stranger
, and was
sorry
to hear you were
so
badly
supplied
with the
necessaries
of life. A plan has
since
struck
me by which you may be relieved from
these
distresses
,
and
restored
to the
ease
and affluence
heretofore been
accustomed
to enjoy.
This was at once calling forth
ditors. Mrs. Abthorpe
raised
face, Sophia and Rebecca
Colonel
listened
in
silence
,
Our army is at
present
in want of experienced
officers
:
You do not hold any
commission
under the King
of England?
But I have eat his bread, Sir,
said
the colonel,
hastily
.
Mrs. Abthorpe
sighed
, and
relapsed
into her
accustomed
pensive
state
.
If you would accept a
commission
in our army,
said
the
stranger
, your property would be again
restored
,
and ample
compensation
made for the
losses
you
have
sustained
.
The Colonel
shook
his head, and made a rejecting
motion with his hand.
You will be
raised
to a rank
superior
to any you
have held in the
British
army, and your name will be
immortalized as one of the glorious
supporters
of
American
liberty.
The colonel frowned
contemptuously
, and was going
to
speak
, but the
stranger
interrupted him:
You will have the felicity of
seeing
your amiable
wife and lovely daughter enjoying again the comforts
and elegancies of life.
Pleasure
will once more inhabit
their
bosoms
, and enliven their features.
The Colonel gazed tenderly on his wife and daughter,
paused
, and
seemed
irresolute
. Mrs. Abthorpe read his
heart.
And what,
said
she
,
addressing
the
stranger
, are
the elegancies of life, when the mind no longer retains
its own approbation. It is true, Sir, the
present
change
in our
circumstances
has awakened
some
painful
sensations
;
but it has not made us unhappy. I do not repine,
for, though unfortunate, we are not
despicable
; our
integrity has ever been
unshaken
, and, I
trust
, will ever
remain
so
.
True my love,
said
the colonel, recollecting
himself
,
we will bear the
present
evils patiently, and hope
for better days in future.
But I would have you weigh this matter maturely,
Colonel,
said
the
stranger
, before you pretend to
decide
.
I have weighed it, Sir. You will pardon my
abruptness
,
and am determined to reject every offer that
would tend to draw me from the loyalty I owe the
best
of
sovereigns
; and allow me to
say
, I
consider
such
offers
as
insults
to my honour.
It is well, Sir,
said
the
stranger
,
rising
, if your
resolution
is taken, I will
say
no more on the
subject
;
but you will
please
to prepare your family for leaving
this place to-morrow. You are to be conveyed twenty
miles farther into the country.
Farther into the country, Sir!
said
the Colonel,
starting
. My wife is unable to bear the journey.
Sophia turned deathly pale, and left the room with
Rebecca.
Do not be
uneasy
, my dear Abthorpe,
said
the
amiable wife; I make no doubt but he, who for his own
wife
purposes
,
suffers
us thus to be afflicted, will endue
me with
strength
of mind and body to bear it as becomes
a
Christian
.
The
stranger
walked
across
the room. He was a
man of feeling, and had very unwillingly undertaken his
commission
. He was
possessed
of every virtue that could
alleviate the human heart. He had been taught to
think the
cause
, in which he was engaged, was a right
cause
. He was young; his
bosom
glowed with
enthusiastic
ardour. Can we blame him? for, though
attached
to the
cause
of his country, he was
still
more
so
to
that of humanity.
I am
sorry
,
said
he; but a
disagreeable
oppression
upon the lungs prevented his proceeding farther.
The Colonel involuntarily took him by the hand:
And had you, my dear Sir been tempted to
desert
your country's
cause
? What
says
your heart? Would
private
interest
have triumphed over the
spirit
patriotism
that now animates your
bosom
?
I have no wife and child,
said
he. The feelings
of
sensibility
could no longer be
restrained
, but
rushed
impetuous from his eyes and though he was a man of
undoubted valour, he did not
blush
to indulge them.
Let
those
blush
,
said
he, mentally, who, cannot
sympathize
with an afflicted fellow creature.
But
suppose
,
said
Mrs. Abthorpe, laying her hand
on his arm, for he had mechanically
stopped
beside
her,
Suppose
, Sir, you had a wife, who would
feel more for your deviation from rectitude, than
she
would to endure the
hardest
pangs of poverty and
sickness
,
and who would rather die than
see
you an
apostate
to the
cause
you had vowed for ever to
espouse
.
He turned abruptly from her;
something
that
spoke
within forbade him to
answer
.
And what have I done,
said
the Colonel, that I
must
leave a place where I have experienced
such
friendship
,
such
disinterested
affection, from many of the
inhabitants
?
You are too near the
sea
coast
,
said
the
stranger
,
and may hold
correspondence
with the enemy.
He averted his eye from the Colonel's face, and
pretended
to
consult
his watch. It is later than I
thought,
said
he, endeavouring at indifference in his
voice and manner.
At eight o'clock to-morrow I expect you will be
removed. God
bless
you, my dear madam,
respectfully
taking Mrs. Abthorpe's hand.
She
saw
the feelings of his
soul
depicted in his face,
and forbore to
encrease
them by
unnecessary
complaint.
The change of air may do me good, Sir,
said
she
with a
smile
of complacency; for it often happens
that what we dread as an evil, in the end contributes to
our advantage.
He gazed on her with a look of reverence and wonder,
bowed profoundly, and, unable to articulate another
sentence
,
hastily
left the room.
CHAP. XXVI.
THE REMOVAL.
And
must
we leave this place, my dear father?
said
Sophia, coming from a
small
adjoining
apartment, whither
she
had retired to indulge the tears
she
was no longer able to
restrain
:
Must
we be
separated
from
those
friends
whose
generous attentions have
lightened all our afflictions?
We
must
, Sophia
said
her father, rather
sternly
,
to-morrow morning.
Ah! me,
said
the weeping girl, turning to
Rebecca
,
and
resting
her head on her
shoulder
.
Do not grieve thus, my dear Sophia,
said
our
heroine
;
for though
separated
from your friends, you will
still
live in their remembrance, and they in your's.
Yes, cried Sophia, with a look of grateful rapture,
ever
while the vital tide
nourishes
my heart. Dear,
worthy inhabitants of
[3]
[3]
A village about twenty miles from
Boston
.
Hingham, when I forget the
friendship
that alleviated my parent's
sorrows
, may that
heart
cease
to beat.
The next morning,
just
as the grey dawn began to
enliven the
East
, Mr. Abthorpe's family were called to
begin their journey. An open
chaise
, drawn by a
miserable
horse
, was all the conveyance provided for Mrs.
Abthorpe, Sophia and Rebecca; the Colonel
himself
was expected to walk. About nine o'clock in the
morning
they
set
out, but the roads were
so
full of
snow
,
and the
horse
so
old and lame, that, though they had
only a journey of twenty miles to make, they had not
completed it at four o'clock in the afternoon. The
darkness
of night had begun to envelope every object,
when the
chaise
stopped
at a hut that could
scarcely
be
called habitable. Rebecca and Sophia
assisted
Mrs.
Abthorpe
to alight; gloomy as was the outward
appearance
of their
destined
habitation, the
inside
served
only
to
increase
their horror; it
consisted
of three rooms.
The windows had once been glazed, but were now
some
parts open, and others mended with wood. One room
was boarded, the others had only the ground for a floor.
There were two chimnies, large and dreary, in which
no trace of fire appeared; all was
desolate
and gloomy!
It was now quite dark, the Colonel was not yet
arrived
.
Rebecca and Sophia felt round the damp
solitary
rooms for
something
on which Mrs. Abthorpe might
sit
down, for
she
was faint and weary from taking no
refreshment
during their tedious journey, and having been
exposed
to the
intense
cold
so
many hours; but their
search
was vain, no
seat
could be found: they took
off their own loaks, and laid them on the floor: On
these
she
sunk
weak and
exhausted
, and, in
spite
of her
accustomed
fortitude,
suffering
nature wrung from her a
few complaints.Rebecca and Sophia knelt
beside
and
supported
herthe voice of comfort no longer
issued
from their lipstheir
sighs
responsive
answered
her's
their tears mingled as they fellbut all remained
silent
.
They heard
footsteps
approachthe Colonel's well
known voice
saluted
their ears.
Dry your eyes, my dear girls,
said
Mrs.
Abthorpe
;
Let us not
increase
his
sorrows
,
whose
every
pang is doubled by our
sufferings
.
The Colonel entered,
some
one accompanied him for
they could hear more than one
footstep
.
We
shall
have a fire
soon
,
said
the Colonel; it
is a very cold evening.
But I am well wrapped up, and do not feel it,
said
Mrs. Abthorpe.
His heart thanked her though it
refused
to believe
her
assertion
.
Just
then a third
person
entered, and threw down an
armful of wood, when the
person
, who had
accompanied
the Colonel, produced a tinder box and
striking
a
light
discoverd
to the
astonished
females the
sons
of two
of their
best
friends.
Mr. Lane! Mr. Barker! involuntarily
burst
from all
their lips; but the generous young men would not hear
a word of
praise
or thanks; they
soon
cheered the
solitary
mansion
with a comfortable fire; in the mean time a
small
cart arrived with two beds, a few chairs, and
some
kitchen
utensils
. From a
basket
in this cart the young men
produced a couple of fowls,
some
butter, bread, and two
bottles of wine,
so
that in
less
than two hours, from
their
first
melancholy entrance, our
distressed
family were
seated
in homely
wise
round an old
wainscot
table,
before
a large fire, partaking a plentiful
supper
, while
their hearts expanded with gratitude to that good
Providence
who had
raised
them up friends when
least
expected
.
The next morning the young men exerted
themselves
to repair the breaches in the windows, and to
stop
the
large crevices in the doors of the
house
, having to the
utmost
of their power,
lessened
their troubles, and
rendered
them tolerably comfortable, they departed,
leaving
behind them
some
meat, bread, butter,
cheese
, and
a
small
parcel of tea and
sugar
; but, as the
last
-named
articles were at that time extremely
scarce
, they could
not be
so
liberal as their expanded hearts lead them
to
wisn
.
Oh! with what rapture
must
the parents of
these
young men have received them after
such
a journey, to
which they had been incited by motives of the
purest
benevolence
;
but benevolence was their
characteristics
.
[4]
[4]
The Author begs leave to add to the names already mentioned,
those
of Gay, Levith, and Thaxter. It is a tribute of gratitude due to
that exalted philanthropy, that
evine
itself
in a
disinterested
friendship
for a family, whole misfortunes were their chief
recommendation
and who had not the
most
distant
hope of being ever able to cancel
their repeated obligations.
Blest
spirits
of philanthropy,
whose
hearts ere
discord
shook
her baleful wings, and
shed
her influence
over your happy plains, in a
state
of
almost
primeval
innocence
,
selt
not a pang but for another's woe, and
whose
first
pleasure
was to alleviate the
sorrows
of a
suffering
fellow creature! May the arrows of afflictions
with which an unnatural war has
since
wounded you,
be drawn forth by the hand of
sympathizing
friendship
and the
anguish
of them obliterated by the recollection
of your own good deeds.
But this is a theme which carries me from every
other. I would
request
pardon for
digressing
my
subject
,
but I know
those
only will blame me, who never
felt the
sweet
emotions of unbounded gratitude.
But to return.
The habitation to which Colonel Abthorpe had been
thus
suddenly
removed, was
situated
on the
skirts
of an
extensive
wood. The face of the country was rocky
and dreary, to which
unpromising
appearance the
snow
and ice not a little contributed. There was but one
habitation
within two miles of them, and that was
occupied
by people, if
possible
more wretched than
themselves
.
In this
dismal
situation
, with no
amusement
but what
sprang
from
themselves
, for they had not even the
consolation
of books, did the Colonel and his family
pass
four
wearisome
months, during which time they had of
ten no food but
coarse
Indian bread and potatoes; nor
any firing but what Sophia and Rebecca
assisted
each
other to bring in their delicate arms from the adjacent
woods, for the Colonel
himself
was great part of that
time
consined
to the
house
with the gout; and in their
daily
excursions
to procure this
necessary
appendage to
the
support
of life in
so
cold a climate, they had no
covering
to their
seet
, which often bled from the
intenseness
of the cold, or from
incisions
made by the rugged
path over which they were obliged to
pass
.
It was the latter end of March, the ice was beginning
to
dissolve
in the warmth of a mid day
sun
, when
Rebecca
,
willing to enjoy a
short
space
of uninterrupted
reflection,
sallied
into the woods, unaccompanied by
Miss
Abthorpe. As
she
gathered up
some
scattered
branches, and laid them together, her thoughts
wandered
to her native land. She retraced every event of
her
past
life; And where now is Sir George?
said
she
. Could he behold me at this
instant
, how
would his generous heart
compassionate
my misfortunes;
but, alas! perhaps I am no more remembered by him,
or he
considers
me as numbered with the dead; and am
I not
so
to him? Then, why
should
I
wish
him to
retain
me in his mind, when, by forgetting me, he may
regain that felicity his generous
sentiments
in my favour
had interrupted. No doubt, he is long
since
married
to the Lady with whom his mother
wished
him to unite.
Ah! my beloved
benefactress
, continued
she
,
sitting
down on a large
stone
at the foot of a
spreading
pine,
dear Lady Mary, little did you think when I parted
from you we were never more to meet! But that
anguish
of heart would from that hour be the unremitting
portion of your Rebecca.
She then drew forth the picture, which, through all
her
distress
,
she
had
still
carefully
preserved
, and
constantly
carried about her in a
small
purse
, in which
she
had
also
deposited
Sir George's letter, and
those
she
had
received from her mother. As
she
opened this precious
repository
, her mother's writing caught her eye.
My poor mother,
said
she
what waves, what
insurmountable
waves, now roll between us! Shall I
ever again behold you? Or is it my fate here, far
distant
from my native land, to end an
existence
, which
though
short
, has been marked by variety of
sorrow
?
Here painful remembrance over-powered her. She
rested
her cheek on her hand, and as
she
held the picture
in the other, alternately
raised
her
streaming
eyes to
heaven, and then fixed them on the portrait of Sir
George.
She was
aroused
from this painful reverie by a deep
drawn
sigh
, which
seemed
to proceed from a
person
very near her, and,
starting
,
saw
a venerable old man
standing
opposite
her, habited in a lieutenant's dirty
uniform.
She
arose
, and, tying her bundle of wood together,
was preparing to lift it, when the old officer approached.
It is too heavy for you, child,
said
he; give
me leave to carry it.
I have not far to go, Sir,
said
Rebecca.
Perhaps you are going by the unfortunate Colonel
Abthorpe's habitation, or can direct me where to find
it?
I live in his family,
said
Rebecca, eagerly. Do
you know him, Sir?
Alas! no, my dear child; but hearing he was a
prisoner
at this place, and being
myself
in the
same
unhappy
predicament, I am going to claim his
society
,
hoping that, as brothers in affliction, we may be
enabled
to comfort each other: But,
surely
, I have
seen
you
before, though where or when I can by no means
recollect
.
Your features too,
said
Rebecca,
seem
samiliar
to me, yet I do not think we ever met before.
They had now reached the
house
, and
depositing
their burthen at the door, entered.
You will pardon me, Sir,
said
the old lieutenant,
advancing to the Colonel, if I,
unasked
, intrude
myself
into your dwelling; but hearing there was an officer
in this place, I could not
resist
the defire I
selt
to be
known to him.
And by what name am I to know and thank you
for this civility?
said
the Colonel, placing a chair for
his
guest
.
My name is Littleton.
Littleton! cried Rebecca,
stepping
eagerly
forward
.
Yes, George Littleton,
said
the Lieutenant. I
have worne his
Majesty
's livery above twenty years.
My name is Littleton,
said
Rebecca.
And your father's name?
Was William.
He is dead, then,
said
Mr. Littleton, with a
difappointed
look.
Rebecca's tears confirmed the
suspicion
.
And did you never hear him
speak
of a brother?
Yes, but as of one long
since
dead.
Alas! he thought me dead, but I am that brother;
nor can I doubt but you are his child, you bear
so
strong
a
resemblance
to him. My dear girl,
continued
he, embracing her, how my heart bleeds to meet
you here, and
so
badly
sheltered
from the inclemency of
the
season
.
A few moments were now devoted to mutual
gratulations
and mutual condolence. When the
first
tumult
was a little
subsided
, Rebecca
wished
to be informed how
it happened that her uncle had been
so
long
supposed
dead by her father?
Disappointment
and vexation,
said
the old
gentleman
,
drove me from my native country; the
loss
of a
wife and child, whom I tenderly loved,
disgusted
me
with life, and I
shipped
myself
to the
East
-Indies, from
whence I hoped never to return.
CHAP. XXVII.
AN OLD MAN'S TALE.
I AM
several
years younger than was your father,
and was placed by an old uncle with a wealthy
merchant, with whom he
promised
to
establish
me when
I had
served
my
clerkship
with honour.
My
master
had an only child;
she
was not what is
usually
called a beauty, but
she
was in my eyes more.
Her features were regular; the
gentleness
of her
spirit
threw a
softness
over her countenance, which at once
prepossessed
every beholder in her favour. Added to the meek
forgiving
spirit
of a
Christian
,
she
possessed
all the
intripid
fortitude and courage of a Roman matron. The
innocence
of her heart
inspired
her with unaffected
cheerfulness
,
and a
most
engaging vivacity was tempered with a
modest
simplicity
.
Such was
Rosa
Benson
, when at the age of eighteen
she
was
sent
for from France, where
she
had been
educated
,
to take the care of her father's
house
, her mother
having
been taken
suddenly
off by an appoplexy. I was
just
two years older, and could not behold unmoved, the
innumerable charms that were daily
displayed
by this
engaging
girl. She performed on the
harpsichord
with great
taste
and execution, had a
soft
melodious voice, and
sung
with judgment. Her mind had been carefully cultivated,
which rendered her a well informed rational companion.
Mr.
Benson
generally
spent
his evenings abroad, and
I frequently
past
many hours in uninterrupted
conversation
with the charming
Rosa
.
I will not pretend to delineate the various imperceptible
degrees by which our hearts became attached to each
other: Suffice it to
say
, we
selt
the power of love
mingled
with the
purest
friendship
; nor did we once reflect
on the imprudence of indulging our
sensibility
till
awakened
from our dream of
bliss
by Mr.
Benson
informing
his daughter, that her hand was
solicited
by an Earl,
and that he had given him leave to
address
her; at the
same
time he gave her to
understand
, he did not expect
any
opposition
to his will, and
slattered
himself
he
should
soon
behold her a
Countess
.
When
Miss
Benson
informed me of this unexpected
stroke
, I
selt
as though annihilated: I threw
myself
at
her feet, and entreated her not to make me the
most
wretched of human beings by accepting my noble rival.
She
assured
me
she
had too high a
sense
of honour to
give her hand to one man, while her heart was entirely
devoted to another, but
still
I was unhappy; nor did I
cease
soliciting
the dear girl till
she
consented
to be mine
by the
strongest
of all ties, and by a private marriage I
secured
to
myself
, as I then thought, the
most
permanent
felicity.
Still the Earl continued his affiduities: but
Rosa
found means to evade her father's
earnest
wishes
, and a
more wealthy woman falling in his
lordship
's way, who
had no objection to making the exchange of money for a
title,
she
was for that time delivered from farther
importunity
.
About
six
months after our marriage, it became
necessary
for Mr.
Benson
to
send
a
person
to the
West-Indies
,
with powers to
settle
some
business
with the
merchants
there: It was a lucrative employment. He
mentioned
to my uncle that I might, if I
chose
, undertake
the voyage. My uncle
acquiesced
. There was no
alternative
,
and I was under the
necessity
of leaving my
wife, whom I could by no means
persuade
to accquaint
her father with our marriage previous to my departure.
During my
absence
I was much
surprized
at receiving
no letters from my dear
Rosa
; but as I was
sensible
there
might be various
causes
for this apparent neglect, it only
served
to render me more attentive to my
business
, as I
knew the
sooner
it was
finished
, the
sooner
I
should
return
to the wife of my choice, the freid of my
bosom
.
At length it was completed, and I returned to my native
land, after being
absent
from it about thirteen months.
Eagerly did I count the minutes
whilst
travelling
from Deal to London; and when the
chaise
stopped
at Mr.
Benson
's door, my heart throbbed with
such
violence
that I could hardly
speak
. I alighted, and ran
hastily
up
stairs
; but was much
surprised
, on entering
the drawing-room, to
see
a
strange
Lady there, young
handsome
, and elegantly
dressed
. Mr.
Benson
mention
ed her as his wife.
And where is
Miss
Rosa
?
said
I.
She is not at home, replied Mr.
Benson
, coolly;
but, come Littleton take your tea, and then we will
go into the counting
house
, and talk over
business
.
Conscious
as I was of the near
interest
I took in every
thing that concerned
Rosa
, I forbore to mention her
again, left the agitation of my mind
should
be betrayed
by my countenance; I took my tea in
silence
, and then
descended
with my
master
to the counting-
house
, where,
in as
concise
a manner as
possible
, I gave him an account
of the
business
I had been
sent
upon, and delivered to
him all the bills and other papers I had brought with
me from Jamacia; this employed us till near one o'clock
in the morning, and,
satigued
as I was, I could not but
be
surprised
that my hitherto indulgent
master
should
have no thought of the long voyage and journey I had
just
arrived from, and that I certainly required
rest
.
When we had entirely
finisshed
, he thus
addressed
me:
I
promised
you, Littleton, that this
should
be a
lucrative
business
to you, there (opening his pocket
book;) there are bills to the amount of two hundred
pounds; and now, Sir, let me tell you, that you are a
knave and a villain, a
designing
, deceitful,
scoundrel
,
who, under the
mask
of honor and probity, have robbed
me of my daughter,
stolen
her affections, and
encouraged
her in
disobedience
. It is to your arts I owe her
refusal
of the Earl of, and had
she
not been your
wise
,
she
would at this moment, have been a
Dutchess
.
I had
sat
as one petrified during this
speech
; but on
his again calling me by the opprobious names already
mentioned, I
roused
myself
, and endeavoured to
answer
;
but his
passion
, like a torrent, bore down all before it,
and I was obliged to be
silent
. At length he told me
he had
disclaimed
his daughter, that he had
sent
her
from his
house
, and would never give her a
single
farthing
,
no not even to keep her from
starving
.
But go, continued he, go to her, and may you
both, with your brat,
starve
together.
The mention of a child operated on my nerves like a
stroke
of electricity. And where are they, Sir?
said
I,
starting
from my
seat
, where are my
Rosa
and
her
insant
?
Somewhere in the country,
said
he; but I don't
concern
myself
with them, nor do I ever
wish
to
see
you
or her again. You have
disappointed
me in my
dearest
hopes and I will
seek
consolation
in the company of an
amiable woman, who may, perhaps, yet bring me
children
more dutiful than the ungrateful viper you have
married.
He then flung out of the room, and I too much
irritated
to remain in a
house
where I had been
so
ill
treated
,
was preparing to leave it, when the door opened,
and one of the
house
maids entered, looking carefully
round her.
I am glad you are come, Sir,
said
she
; my poor
young Lady will rejoice to
see
you.
Where is
she
, Betty?
said
I.
At
Windsor
, replied the girl, at my
sister
's;
but
she
has never been well
since
master
was born.
I took a direction from the girl, and
set
off
immediately
,
as I could procure a
chaise
.
It was between five and
six
when I arrived at
Windfor
,
and having ordered
some
breakfast
, though I had
no inclination to eat, I
sent
for the woman with whom
my love lodged, and finding her a
discreet
sensible
person
,
intrusted
her with a letter to be dilivered
cautiously
,
to the dear creature, who I found was in a very
alarming
state
.
In about two hours I was
summoned
to the cottage
that contained all my
treasure
; but, good heaven! how
shall
I
describe
my
sensation
at the
sight
of my wife,
scarcely
the
shadow
of her former
self
palethinher
eyes
sunk
heavyand devoid of
luster
!
George,
said
she
, putting her dear boy into my
arms, you are come home in time to receive this
pledge of my love, and to
close
my eyes; but I
shall
die
content,
sensible
that you will be a kind father to my
child.
I endeavourd to cheer her, and
inspire
her with hopes
which I could not rationally indulge
myself
. I procured
the
best
medical advice, but all in vain;
she
grew
worse
and
worse
, and expired in
less
than a fortnight after
my arrival in England.
Previous to her death
she
informed me that another,
still
more
splended
, offer of marriage,
strenuously
urged by
her father, had wrung from her the
secret
of our
marriage
,
and that
she
was immediately
dismissed
from her
father's
house
in the
most
disgraceful
manner; that
she
had wrote to my uncle, claiming his
protectionif
not on her own account, for the
sake
of the unborn
infant
;
but his
answer
was, that as I
chose
to marry
without
consulting
him, I might maintain my wife as I
could for he would never more do any thing for me;
and as to her he thought
she
must
have behaved very ill,
when her own father had
discarded
her. From that time
he entirely withdrew his favour, from me, and, though
I went to him
soon
after the death of my wife, I was
not permitted to
see
him.
About this time your father, who was then an
ensign
in a marching regiment, was ordered to Ireland. I had
not
seen
him for
some
years, as he had been
stationed
at
Plymouth; but could not let him leave the kingdom
without taking a
personal
leave: I therefore left my
dear boy with the good woman where my
Rosa
had
lodged, and
sat
off for that place.
I had not been with my brother above three days,
before I received a letter from the
nurse
, informing me
that my boy had been carried off by a
convulsion
fit the
day after I left
Windsor
. The world now appeared to
me an
universal
blank. I
considered
myself
as a mere
cypher, without family, connexion or friends, and
possessing
but a
small
portion of wordly goods. I had
formed
an acquaintance with
several
officers belonging to
one of his
Majesty
's
ships
going to China; a
desire
of
roving took
possession
of my mind. I had, when a boy,
been fond of the
study
of mathematics, and during my
voyage to Jamaica, had contracted a
fondness
for a
nautical
life, I therefore
requested
to be admitted on board
the Triton, and was accepted.
In this
ship
I went to the
East
-Indies, fully
resolved
never to
visit
England again. This
resolution
I kept
inviolate
for many years, always, changing into
some
ship
stationed
in
those
parts whenever the one I was in was
remanded home. In his
Majesty
's
service
I
arose
by
degrees to the rank of lieutenant, and my ambition had
led me to hope, during this war, I
should
have
risen
still
higher, for the
ship
I was in, being ordered home,
and I unable to obtain an exchange into one
stationed
in
India, I returned to England, and was
soon
after
sent
in a cutter with
expresses
to the fleet at New-York, from
whence I was
dispatched
to
Boston
, where I
unfortunately
arrived after the evacuation of his
Majesty
's
troops, and of
consequence
fell into the hands of the
enemy. I have been detained a
prisoner
now near two
years, frequently removed from one place to another,
and every removal is
still
for the
worse
; but I hear there
is now an exchange of
prisoners
talked of,
so
I hope to
be included in the cartel.
But did you never write to my father?
said
Rebecca
.
Yes, frequently, during the
first
year of my
absence
from Europe; but never receiving any
answers
,
owing, as I imagined, to the
unsettled
life a
soldier
in
general leads, I at length
ceased
to write. When I
was
last
in England I enquired for him of
some
of our
old friends, and learned that he was married, and had
one child; but they could give no information where he
was
settled
, as they had neither
seen
or heard from
him for many years.
Rebecca felt a gleam of comfort dilate her affectionate
heart, at having thus unexpectedly found a relation:
I am not then entirely unconnected,
said
she
,
mentally
,
at the
same
time laying her hand on that of her
uncle, and looking at him with eyes
swimming
in tears
of filial
tenderness
, excited by the
strong
resemblance
he
bore to her father.
My dear girl,
said
he, you have found an old
uncle who will love you with all his heart, and defend
you to the
last
hour of his
existence
; but I am as poor,
Rebecca, as when I
first
put on his
Majesty
's livery. In
all my long
servicce
I have not picked up above two
hundred pounds prize-money, and, thinking I had no
one to take it after me, I have
spent
it as
fast
, or,
perhaps
,
sometimes
faster
than I gained it. But my pay
has been running
so
long, we
shall
be quite rich when I
get home, and you
shall
call me father, and make up to
me the
loss
of my
Rosa
and her boy.
I will be your daughter in every
sense
of the word,
said
Rebecca, affectionately
kissing
his hand.
The
conversation
now took a more general turn:
Colonel
Abthorpe was delighted with the
acquisition
of a
friend. They could not think of parting till evening,
nor then without a mutual
promise
of maintaining a
frequent
intercourse
.
G
CHAP. XXVIII.
WE COME HOME AGAIN.
When
Colonel Abthorpe retired to
rest
, he
revolved
in his mind what Mr. Littleton had
said
concerning an exchange of
prisoners
. His wife's
declining
health had long made him
uneasy
. He flattered
himself
was he once removed from captivity, and
enabled
to obtain
subsistence
for his family, her mind would
be more at
ease
, and
she
would of
consequence
recover
her health and
spirits
.
These
reflections occupied
him all night, and totally
banished
sleep
. At dawn of
day he
arose
, and
sat
down to draw up a petition,
praying
to be, with his family, included in the intended
exchange.This petition he
presented
to the
select
-men
of the place, to be by them
transmitted
to the general
court. The
answer
he received was a repetition of the
offers of employment in the American army, enforced
with
promises
of the
most
beneficial and lucrative
rewards
for his
services
.
These
he
strenuously
rejected,
declaring a
resolution
to die rather than
forsake
the
cause
of loyalty.
They found it was in vain to
increase
either their
offers
of affluence, or their ill treatment; he was alike
unmoved by either, at
least
he did not
suffer
them to
perceive the effect his
miseries
had on his mind. If he
sighed
it was in
secret
, and he waited with an
assumed
patience the end of his misfortunes, while the
most
afflictive
sensations
corroded in his
bosom
: But when he
had
almost
bidden adieu to hope, when
despair
seemed
to have taken
possession
of his mind, then was
deliverence
nearest
at hand, and he received a letter,
informing
him he was to be exchanged with his family by
the very next cartel. They were accordingly removed
to
Boston
, and, in company with Mr. Littleton, put on
board a
small
vessel
, bearing a flag of truce, in which
they arrived, after a ten days
passage
,
safe
at Hallifax.
Here Mr. Littleton was immediately employed,
and drew on his agent for money to provide
himself
and Rebecca with
necessaries
; nor did he withhold
part of his little
store
from Colonel Abthorpe, who
was really in
necessitous
circumstances
. Mrs. Abthorpe's
malady had gained too much ground on her delicate
constitution
ever to be repelled. She continued to
decline
,
and, in a few weeks after their arrival in
Nova-Scotia
,
she
sunk
to eternal
rest
! Rebecca exerted
herself
to comfort poor Sophia; but it was now become
absolutely
necessary
for them to part. Colonel Abthorpe
had not the means even of
supporting
himself
and
daughter
,
much
less
an extra
person
:
Besides
, Rebecca was
eager to
revisit
England, and
see
her mother; he
therefore
furnished
her with recommendatory letters to
several
Ladies in London. Her uncle provided her a
passage
,
and gave her an order on his agent for the
small
remainder
of all his worldly wealth. She took an
affectionate
leave of her dear
Miss
Abthorpe, and embarked
for her native land. It
seemed
as though the elements
were as eager to convey our heroine in
safety
home, as
they had been
perverse
and tardy in bearing her from
thence; for on the twenty-eighth day from her leaving
Halifax, at the
close
of the evening,
she
found
herself
set
down at the door of the
Cross
-Keys Inn, in
et">set
down at the door of the
Cross
-Keys Inn, in
street
, London. She had landed with a widow
lady and her maiden
sister
(who came in the
ship
with
her) at Deal, and they had proceeded to town in a
postchaise
.
She remained at the inn with them that night,
and the next morning took a coach to
seek
the
benevolent
friend of Mrs. Harris in the Borough. She was
removed, but Mrs. Harris
herself
occupied the
house
:
Rebecca therefore, met a hearty welcome, and
determined
to take up her abode with her till
she
could hear
from her mother, to whom
she
immediately wrote.
Anxiously
did
she
count the time till
she
thought it
possible
to receive an
answer
. At length the welcome
sound
of a
postman
's rap
saluted
her ears. She
almost
flew to the door. The letter required double
postage
;
she
paid it without
hesitation
, and
hastily
returned to
G 2
the parlour to examine its contents; but as
she
approached
the candle, what were her feelings to
discover
it was her own letter returned, with
these
words written
on the
outside
:
Removed to London two years ago!
To London!
said
Rebecca; but what part of
London? Good heavens! that I
should
be in the
same
place with my mother, and yet unable to find her! But,
perhaps, I have no mother now, continued
she
,
mournfully
:She
has been removed two years; alas!
sorrow
may have levelled her with the
dust
long
since
.
She then endeavoured to recollect
some
person
in her
native village, to whom
she
could
address
herself
, in
hopes of gaining information whether her mother had
mentioned what part of the town
she
intended to
reside
in. At length
she
recollected the parents of Ruth, who
had lived
several
years
servant
in the family, and was
with them when her father died. To them
she
immediately
wrote, and, as early as
she
could
possibly
expect,
received the following
answer
:
TO
MRS. REBECCA LITTLETON.
My dear young
mistress
,
This comes with father and mother's kind love to
you, letting you know that we are all main glad to hear
you are alive, and come home again to old England, for,
certain
sure
, we all thought you had been dead a long
while ago;
so
when father put on his
spectacles
, and
began to read your letter, I thought as how I
should
have
sounded
for joy; for indeed, and for
sarten
,
Miss
Becky, I would walk a many long miles to
see
your
sweet
face. Oh! dear, if you was but as rich, and as
happy as you are good, and as we all
wish
you.
As to your mother, we are deadly afraid
she
has
made but a poor hand of marrying again, for old Serl
was but a
shabby
kind of body, though he pretended to
be
so
grand, and tried to make folks believe he was a
gentleman.
To be
sure
they did
flash
away about a month or
two after they were married, and Peg Serl had a
mortal
fight of new cloaths, but for all
she
never looked
like a lady. Father
said
as how you looked more like
one in a linen gown, and your nice curling hair without
powder, than
she
did in her
silks
and
sattins
, and her
hair
plastered
up with
grease
and flour; but after all
they did not hold out long. Serl did not
use
your poor
foolish
mother well; he kept an impudent
hussy
almost
under her
nose
, and
used
to be always a drinking and
sotting
, and
so
the
sinery
all went away by littles and
littles
,
and then they got
sadly
in debt, and at
last
went off
to London, without letting any body know about it;
but
cousin
Dick was in London
last
Martinmas twelve
months, and he
said
he
saw
Mrs. Serl go into a
house
in
Westminster
, but
she
looked main
shabby
, and we never
since
heard nothing about her.
Father bid me tell you, that he read in the
newspaper
how that Sir George Worthy was married to a
great Lady; but father
says
he could not have found a
more better Lady than your own
sweet
self
, be the other
who
she
may, and we all thought as how, when Lady
Mary (
bless
her dear name)! took you to live with her,
that we
should
one day
see
you come back to the village,
Lady of the Manor; but it can't be helped, marrying
and hanging they
say
goes by fate. Mother and father
send
their kind love and duty to you,
wishing
you a
good rich
husband
, and
soon
; and
so
no more at
present
from your's to
serve
till death.
RUTH RUSSETT.
When Rebecca had
finished
reading this letter her
mind was in a
state
of anarchy, better imagined than
described
. She
sat
with the letter open on the table
before
herher hands folded in each otherher eyes fixed
on vacancy.
Well, what news, my dear,
said
Mrs. Harris, as
she
came into the room, and, without particularly
observing
G 3
Rebecca, very
leisurely
stirred
the fire as
she
spoke
to her.
He is married, replied Rebecca
unconsciously
.
Well, child, you knew that before, I thought.
No, indeed; this is the
first
I ever heard of it.
Why, how you talk!
said
Mrs. Harris,
staring
at her; to my certain knowledge
she
wrote you word
of it
herself
.
Who wrote me word of it?
Why, your mother, child.
Oh! my mother, cried Rebecca, endeavouring
to rally her
scattered
thoughts; then,
pausing
for a
moment, my poor mother, continued
she
,
bursting
into tears, I fear I
shall
never
see
her more.
There was a
wildness
in her looks, an incoherence in
her manner, that alarmed the
compassionate
Mrs.
Harris
.
She drew a chair, and
sat
down
beside
her, took
both her hands in her's,
pressed
them tenderly, but
remained
silent
. This was a conduct more congenial to
the mind of Rebecca than the
most
eloquent harangue
could have been. She
rested
her head on the
bosom
of
her friend, gave a free vent to her tears, and, by
degrees
,
regained a tolerable degree of
composure
.
CHAP. XXIX.
VARIOUS SCENES.
When
Rebecca had repelled the violence of her
first
emotions, on finding Sir George was
really
lost
to her, her mother's unfortunate marriage, and
its
consequences
recurred to her mind,
she
retired to bed,
but not to
rest
;
sleep
was a
stranger
to her eyes, and
her thoughts were
so
harrassed
, that in the morning her
heavy eyes, pale lips, and burning hands, alarmed Mrs.
Harris.
Come, come, child,
said
she
, gently
shaking
her,
I
must
not
see
you in this way; you are far from well
now, and if you go on fretting thus, I
shall
have you
quite laid up. You
must
rouse
yourself
, my dear; it is
very wrong to give way to
sorrow
for misfortunes that
are irremediable.Chance may, perhaps,
discover
in
what part of the town your mother is; in the mean
time you
must
not neglect your own
interest
. You
have never yet waited on any of the ladies to whom
Colonel Abthorpe gave you letters. I will have you
dress
yourself
this very day, and go to
some
of them.
Perhaps you may meet with a
situation
where, by your
mind being
constantly
occupied, you will have no time
to fret
yourself
to death, which I
foresee
will be the
case
if you are left to
yourself
.
Indeed, Mrs. Harris, I have no
cause
to
wish
for
life,
said
Rebecca, in a melancholy accent, for, in
the whole world, I have no friend but you and my poor
uncle; him, perhaps, I
shall
never
see
again, and you,
I fear, will grow weary of
such
a child of
sorrow
.
Now you are very unkind, Rebecca, to
suppose
me capable of neglecting you, or being wearied by your
complaints! No, my child, I feel for you every thing
that
friendship
and affection can feel for a beloved object;
and it is
because
I think it
necessary
to your health that
you
should
be
roused
from this
state
of inaction, that
makes me willing to be deprived of your
society
:
Besides
,
my dear, your mother may be, nay, in all
probability
,
is alive, and, at
some
future period, you may
have it in your power to render her happy and
comfortable
in her latter hours by your
tenderness
and filial
love: For her
sake
, then, exert your natural good
sense
,
and bear your afflictions with becoming
resignation
; it is
an
indispensable
duty you owe to her, to
yourself
and to
your Creator.
Oh! Mrs. Harris, cried Rebecca, pardon my
petulance; I
see
the friendly
design
of your advice, and
will exert
myself
to follow it.
G 4
She now began to look over her letters, and
determined
to wait that morning on Lady Winterton and
Mrs. Sackville, who lived both in a
street
near
Cavendish
square
. She had two more letters, but they were to
ladies in the city.
Rebecca's
dress
was plain and neat in the extreme,
yet there was a dignity in her
person
and manner that
ever commanded
respect
: She, therefore, on knocking
at Lord Winterton's door, was immediately
ushered
into
a parlour, and the
servant
took the letter to his Lady.
The Lady was at her morning toilet. She
cast
her
eyes
hastily
over the letter.
What kind of a
person
brought this, Thomas?
said
she
to the man who waited
just
without the door
of the
dressing
room.
A very genteel young woman, replied the man.
Well,
shew
her into the
breakfast
parlour, and tell
her I
shall
be with her
presently
. Is my Lord up?
Yes, my Lady, he is
just
gone down.
Well, go, do as I bid you.
The man departed, and Rebecca was
desired
to walk
into a parlour, where in his night gown and
slippers
,
sat
a
personage
, the exact counterpart of Lord Ogleby
in the
Clandestine
Marriage.
Rebecca
started
, and was going to retire.
Pray, Madam,
said
my Lord,
rising
, do not
let me frighten you; my Lady will be here directly.
Thomas, a chair for the young Lady.
Rebecca
blushed
,
courtseyed
, and took her
seat
.
My Lord eyed her attentively. She felt her
confusion
increase
.
She is a very fine girl, thought his
Lordship
; I
wonder who the devil
she
is.
The weather is very fine for the
season
, Madam,
said
he, thinking it was incumbent upon him to
say
something
, though, in fact, it had rained
incessantly
for a week.
The
sun
did break out for about an hour this
morning
;
said
our heroine, half
smiling
; but he
seems
to
have withdrawn
himself
again.
He was
conscious
, Madam, that when your
beauties
were
visible
to the admiring eyes of mortals, his
fainter glories could not be
missed
.
Heavens! thought Rebecca, what a ridiculous
old man, with his
bombastic
compliment: However, I
am glad he is old; perhaps his Lady may want a
person
to read to her, or by cheerful
assiduity
,
otherwise
amuse
her. She had, in her own mind, pictured Lady
Winterton
as an elderly Lady, perhaps upwards of
sixty
years old. In this family, thought
she
,
should
I be
so
happy as to be placed, I
shall
be free from the
noise
and impertinence
so
frequently to be met with in the
families
of young people of quality. I dare
say
they do
not keep much company; nay, perhaps, live in the
country above half the year. I
wish
I may
suit
her
Ladyship
;
she
certainly wants
somebody
, either for
herself
or
some
of her freinds, by her
desiring
me to wait to
see
her.
As Rebecca was indulging
these
reflections the door
opened, and a Lady entered, in appearance not more
than twenty, habited in a very
modish
undress
.
Miss
Littleton, I
presume
,
said
she
, advancing
Rebecca
courtseyed
.
Colonel Abthorpe,
said
the Lady, motioning for
her to be again
seated
, has had a very
disagreeable
time in America. I dare
say
you are happy to find
yourself
in England again.
Sincerely
so
, Madam.
This thought Rebecca, is undoubtedly a daughter.
The Colonel mentions,
resumed
the Lady, that
you would
wish
to engage as companion to an elderly
Lady, or as
governess
to
some
genteel family of
children
.
Either
situation
would
suit
me, Madam,
said
Rebecca; and if Lady Winterton could recommend
me.
Lady Winterton wants a companion
herself
,
said
the Lady,
smiling
; but, perhaps, her age will be an
objection.
By no means, Madam; I
should
give the preference
to an elderly Lady.
The Lady laughed; Rebecca
blushed
, and feared
she
had been guilty of
some
impropriety.
Why, my dear creature,
said
the Lady, I am
afraid, then, that you and I
shall
never agree, though
Colonel Abthorpe
seemed
to think that you might prove
an
acquisition
to me; but I am too young for you,
so
must
positively
turn you over to my Lord; he is more
adapted to your
taste
.
Your
Ladyship
must
pardon my ignorance,
said
the trembling,
blushing
Rebecca; I really had no
idea.
Hear her! hear her! my dear Lord;
she
had no
idea that your
senatorial
wisdom
could have for wife
such
an
inconsiderate
rattle. I would bet a
thousand
pounds
she
took you for my papa.
Your
Ladyship
is
pleased
to
display
your wit at the
expence of good manners,
said
his
Lordship
.
Oh! I humbly crave pardon, cried
she
with a
most
bewitching
smile
, I meant no offence; you know
I cannot help other people's
mistakes
; for my own part
I think you infinitely charming; then
twisting
one of
his grey locks round her beautiful fingers,
she
continued
:
The
snow
on the hills, and the icicles pendant
from the
leafless
trees in December, are in my eyes, to
the full as beautiful as the variegated fields and full-blown
hawthorn in May. I like every thing in its
season
, and
am moreover a great admirer of natural
curiosities
.
Impertinent!
said
his
Lordship
,
rising
angrily,
and quitting the room.
Well, now he is gone,
said
her
Ladyship
,
drawing
her chair near Rebecca, let us have a little
serious
talk. You cannot
suppose
that inclination led me to
give my hand to that ludicrous piece of antiquity:
No, my dear girl, I married him to
serve
a father,
whom next to heaven, I love, and to get from the
power of an ill-natured old maiden aunt, who had kept
me at
school
for fear I
should
mar her fortune, and
despoil
her of all her lovers; for
she
had thirty
thousand
pounds independent fortune, and that gave her wizened
face and
skeleton
figure ten
thousand
charms;
she
or her
fortune had admirers innumerable. I was always with
her at the holidays. My Lord
saw
me at the play.
Charmed with the idea of getting me married out of the
way,
she
made her will, bequeathing to me all her
fortune
,
in
case
she
died without
issue
.
This was buzzed abouther lovers all
forsook
her
and poor aunty died of a broken heart in the fifty
ninth year of her age! My father had married this
Lady's
sister
. He was poor. She was the co-
heiress
of a
la ge fortune; but alas!
she
knew not that if
she
married
without her guardians
consent
, the whole of her
fortune
went to her
eldest
sister
.
Disappointment
and
sorrow
soon
put a period to
her
existence
. My father continued in poverty, but I
was committed to the care of my wealthy aunt.
At that time I became acquainted with Lord
Winterton
,
my father's
circumstances
were dreadfully
embarrassed
.
My aunt would not advance a
single
guinea
to keep him from a gaol. I knew this marriage would
place him in affluence, and at the age of
sixteen
, gave
my hand,
promised
to love and obey, before my heart
knew what love was. I have been married now five
years; my temper is naturally cheerful, and I am an
enemy to thought; but I have that within me which
convinces me I have a heart alive to every delicate
sensation
of
disinterested
tenderness
.
You may, perhaps, think it odd, that I am thus
open to a
stranger
; but Colonel Abthorpe, who was
the intimate friend of my father, has given you a
character
as bade me to
wish
to make an
interest
in your
heart, that I may
say
I have one
bosom
in which I can
repose
my
sorrows
, one friend who will pity my
frailties
.
Rebecca felt inclined to love this unfortunate young
creature from the
first
moment
she
beheld her. A very
few words
served
to
settle
every preliminary, and it was
agreed that the very next day
she
should
repair to her
new
situation
.
As the time allowed her was
so
very
short
, Rebecca
thought
she
would make
use
of the
rest
of that day to
deliver all the other letters; for,
said
she
, it is
right that I
should
wait on
these
Ladies, though I am
settled
with Lady Winterton; they may at
some
future
period be of
service
to me. She accordingly repaired
to Mrs. Sackville's.
Being
shewn
into the drawing-room, a tall, meagre
figure
presented
itself
, who
scarcely
deigned an
inclination
of the head as
she
took the letter, and, waving her
hand, cried, Sit down young woman.
Having read the letterAnd
so
you have been in
America, child? cried the Lady, with the
same
solemn
aspect
. Well, I dare
say
, they are all in fine
confusion
there; but let their
distress
be ever
so
great, it is
no more than they
deserve
, a parcel of
rebels
.
They may have been
misled
, cried Rebecca, an
enthusiastic
ardour animating her
expressive
countenance
;
but they are in general a brave, benevolent
set
of people.
'Tis a pity, as you are
so
partial, you had not
remained
amongst
them.
I had no friends there, Madam, and
wished
to
return
to my native country.
Nay, you have not many friends here,
said
the
Lady, with a
sarcastic
smile
, according to the
Colonel's
account.
Rebecca's eyes filled with tears.Mrs. Sackville
continued
:
I do not know of any body at
present
who
wants a young
person
of your
description
.
You will pardon me, Madam,
said
Rebecca, for
this
intrusion
; I did it merely in
respect
to the
generous
attention of Colonel Abthorpe, who
furnished
me
with
several
letters; but I have been
so
fortunate as to
be engaged this very morning as companion to Lady
Winterton.
'Tis very well,
said
Mrs. Sackville,
tossing
her
head: Lady Winterton, I believe, wanted a
convenient
friend, and very
possible
you may
suit
her
purpose
:
However young woman, do not
say
you go into her
family without knowing what kind of a woman
she
is. I
have a very great regard for Lady Winterton, and
should
be very
sorry
to
say
any thing to her
disadvantage
;
but all the world knows
she
married Lord
Winterton
to hide an infamous intrigue with a low bred
fellow
whom nobody knows. I thank heaven I have been
brought up to know the real value of virtue, and
should
be very
sorry
to
see
a decent looking body, like
yourself
,
companion to a woman of no principle: However,
you are to do as you
please
; I have given you my
opinion
,
and you
must
take the
consequence
of rejecting my
advice. She then rang the bell, and Rebecca
departed
with no very high opinion of her good nature,
whatever
her other virtues might be.
She then repaired into the city, and delivered the
other two letters, but neither of the ladies were at
home;
she
therefore immediately proceeded to her
lodgings, and informed Mrs. Harris of the
success
of
her
excursion
. Mrs. Harris
advised
her not to be
disheartened
at the account Mrs. Sackville had given of
Lady Winterton; but
should
she
find her the
unprincipled
woman
she
had been
represented
, to leave her
immediately
.
Surely,
said
Rebecca,
she
cannot be abandoned
to vice; if her countenance is the index of her mind.
On the evening of this day our heroine received a
friendly letter from Mrs. Barton, who gave her a
pressing
invitation to
visit
her, and make her
house
her
home: but Rebecca
detested
a
state
of dependence
she
therefore wrote a grateful return to this invitation,
and acquainted her with her engagement with Lady
Winterton.
C H A P. XXX.
VARIETY STILL.
When
Rebecca began to feel
herself
settled
in
Wimpole-
street
,
she
also
began to find that
she
had entered on an entire new life.Lady Winterton was
extremely gay,
saw
a great deal of company, and lived
in one continued round of
dressing
,
visiting
, and public
amusements
. It was in vain for our heroine to object to
accompanying her;
she
had taken a peculiar fancy to
her
society
, and was never happy without her. Lord
Winterton loved gaiety, and an
ostentatious
display
of
grandeur as well as his Lady: She was therefore never
abridged in her
pleasures
, were they ever
so
extravagant,
and the old Peer thought
himself
amply repaid for the
most
splendid
entertainments, or elegant
presents
, by
the
smiles
and good humour of his Lady, who, in
spite
of her caprice and
satyrical
wit, he tenderly loved.
One morning Rebecca had accompanied her Lady to
an auction, where they had
scarcely
been
seated
ten
minutes
before a very elegant young man approached them,
and being introduced to her as a Mr. Savage, a
particular
friend of her
Ladyship
's, attached
himself
to them
the whole morning.Rebecca did not
observe
any thing
uncommon in his attentions to Lady Winterton, but
she
thought, as he handed her
Ladyship
to her carriage,
she
saw
him put a folded paper into her hand, which
she
immediately conveyed into her pocket.
As it drew towards evening the Lady
seemed
vastly
uneasy
,
especially
when
she
found her Lord meant to
spend
his evening at home: however, after
she
had
taken
her tea,
she
ordered her chariot.
Am I not then to have the
pleasure
of your
company
,
Fanny?
said
his
Lordship
. I
proposed
supping
at home,
because
I heard you were
disengaged
.
Oh! my Lord, I
shall
be home again in about two
hours.
Miss
Littleton and I are only going to call on
a
sick
friend of her's.
Rebecca
stared
. Lady Winterton gave her a
supplicating
look, and,
surprised
as
she
was,
she
remained
silent
.
If
Miss
, Littleton
wishes
to
visit
her friends,
said
my Lord, the chariot is certainly at her
service
; but,
surely
, my dear Fanny, you are not obliged to
accompany
her.
Indeed but I am! and I am
sensible
the Lady will
take it very unkind were I to neglect going. Don't you
think
she
would, Rebecca.
I think,
said
Rebecca, timidly, we may both
venture to defer our
visit
till the morning, as my lord is
so
kind as to
spend
the evening at home.
Ah! that is your good nature, my dear; you
would rather offend your friend, than lead me to
disoblige
my
husband
; but
suppose
we
settle
it this way: I
will go and
see
how the lady is, and you
shall
stay
and
engage my Lord at piquet. I
shall
just
call at my
mantua-maker's
in my way home, and be with you again
before
supper
.
Your
Ladyship
will pardon me,
said
Rebecca,
giving her a penetrating look: If you are
resolved
to
go, you
shall
not have to
say
I am
remiss
in the duty
I owe my friend. I am ready to attend you, Madam,
rising
, and ringing for her cloak.
For heaven's
sake
! Lady Winterton,
said
Rebecca
,
as the chariot drove from the door, what is the
meaning of all this? You have
distressed
me beyond
measure
, by calling on me to
assert
a
falshood
.
Now you are angry with me, Rebecca,
said
the
Lady, taking her hand; but pray think no more
about it: I could contrive no other means to get away
from that
inquisitive
old man, without telling him where
I was going.
And
surely
your
Ladyship
does not
wish
to go any
where that would be
offensive
to your
husband
.
Oh! my dear girl, you will never forgive me, you
are
such
a prudent creature
yourself
; but I am going to
meet , though, believe me, it
shall
be the
last
time. I am going to meet , and take a
last
farewell of Savage.
By your
Ladyship
's
promising
it
shall
be the
last
time, I am led to think it is not the
first
. I could have
excused
your making me
accessary
to
such
an affair:
However, I
shall
take care not to be liable to be drawn
in a
second
time.
Ah!
Miss
Littleton, you have no
compassion
for
a
susceptible
heart.
Yes, Lady Winterton, I have, an infinite deal; I
feel for you
sincerely
, if when your
person
is united to
one, your heart is in the
possession
of another. Your
feelings, Madam, are involuntary; your actions are by
no means
so
: I am
sensible
you may not be able to
conquer
the
weakness
of your heart; but you certainly
may avoid throwing
yourself
into
situations
which may
lead to criminality.
The chariot
stopped
Lady Winterton alighted
and Rebecca followed her
silently
into a parlour,
where Savage was eagerly expecting her.
The
ensuing
scene
, to which our heroine was a
witness
,
though it awakened all her
compassion
for the
lovers
,
who in years,
sentiments
and manner,
seemed
so
suitable
to each other, it gave her but an indifferent
opinion of her Lady's prudence. Savage, from his
conversation
,
appeared a man of
strict
honour; he did
not
seem
to entertain an idea to the injury of his
mistress
; but that unfortunate woman, hurried on by the
violence of her
passion
, made a
thousand
discoveries
of
her unbounded affections, which, with a man of
less
integrity
,
might have precipitated her into
everlasting
infamy.
The
promise
of returning to
supper
was entirely
forgot
.
Rebecca reminded her of the hour:
she
heard
her not, and the clock
struck
twelve before
she
could
bring
herself
to leave her lover.
During their ride home Rebecca
spoke
not a
syllable
except one or two laconic
answers
to her Lady's
questions
.
She followed her into the hall, and, taking a
candle from a
servant
,
wished
her a good night, and ran
hastily
up
stairs
, leaving Lady Winterton to make her
excuses
to her
husband
for her breach of
promise
.
The next morning, as
she
was
rising
, one of the maids
brought her the following note.
For heaven's
sake
! my dear Rebecca, do not
contradict
whatever you may hear me
say
at
breakfast
, as
you value the peace of
F. WINTERTON.
Rebecca threw the note into the fire, and went down
stairs
. Her Lord and Lady were already in the parlour.
And how do find
yourself
this morning, my dear?
said
her
Ladyship
: I vow you quite frightened me
last
night.
Are you often taken in
such
a
strange
manner?
said
his
Lordship
, with a look of concern.
No, indeed, my Lord; I was taken quite by
surprise
last
night, and found
myself
very painfully
affected
.
I never was taken that way before, but I have felt
a return of the
disorder
this morning.
Indeed! cried her
Ladyship
,
visibly
alarmed.
Yes, Madam; but as change of air may be of
service
to me, and your
Ladyship
seems
terrified on my
account
,
I
shall
beg leave to retire to a friend's I have
some
few miles from town. I
shall
go directly after
breakfast
, and will
send
to-morrow for my trunks.
You do not mean to leave us, I hope?
Yes, Madam; I fee; it
impossible
for me to remain
with you any longer. Lady Winterton
burst
into tears.
Nay,
Miss
Littleton,
said
his
Lordship
, you
must
not leave us; my poor Fanny will break her heart.
It was to no
purpose
for the Lady to weep, or her
husband
entreat: Rebecca remained inexorable, till
Lord Winterton leaving them, his Lady
earnestly
entreated
her to forgive what was
past
, and
she
would
never
see
Savage again.
Do not leave me, Rebecca,
said
she
; you are my
guardian angel; without you I
shall
be inevitably
lost
!
This argument prevailed, and Rebecca
consented
to
stay
, in hopes of drawing her Lady from her
unfortunate
attachment. The winter was now entirely
supplauted
by the gay-robed
spring
, and our heroine began to
sigh
for retirement,
silver
streams
, and
shady
groves.
Lady Winterton, to oblige her,
proposed
spending
a
few weeks at
Chiswick
, where they had an elegant
seat
.
It was a charming evening in the beginning of June;
the ruddy
streaks
of the parting
sun
-beams had given
place to
sober
grey; the moon with
silver
crescent
shed
a
feeble light, and the
stars
, by imperceptible degrees,
appeared
in the blue expance of heaven, till all was one
continued
scene
of radiant glory. A nightingale perched
on a thorn, was tuning her melancholy pipe, and the
zephyrs
passed
gently over a long canal,
wasting
on
their wings the
distant
sound
of the tinkling
sheep
bell,
and the
rustic
shepherd
's
whistle
.
Rebecca had left her Lady in an alcove at the bottom
of the garden, and wandered into the
pleasure
ground.
The beauty of the
surrounding
scene
had given a
soft
serenity
to her mind, and
she
sat
down to indulge
reflections, which, if not
absolutely
pleasant
, were far
from painful.
She had not
sat
long before
she
observed
two men
gliding among the trees, and proceeding as it were
towards
the garden. At
first
she
felt rather
terrisied
, but
the idea of Savage
striking
her,
she
hastened
toward the
place where
she
had left her Lady. She had hardly got
half way before
she
felt
herself
suddenly
seized
by a
person
,
who
softly
bid her not be alarmed, he only meant
to prevent her
disturbing
an agreeable
tete a tete
, to
which a friend of his had been invited, and which
he was determined
should
not be interrupted by her.
Rebecca trembled
excessively
, for, by the voice, and
what little
she
could
discern
of his features,
she
discovered
the
person
who held her to be no other than Lord
Ossiter
.
Whoever your friend is,
said
she
, he can have
no
business
here. Unhand me, Sir, or I will alarm the
house
.
You
must
cry pretty loud, then, my dear, for you
are a good
distance
from it; but
stay
, have I not
seen
your face before? Yes, by heavens!
At that moment, a loud
shriek
from the alcove, and
a
clasthing
of
swords
, made him
relinquish
his hold, and
run toward the place from whence the
sound
proceeded.
Rebecca followed as
fast
as her trembling limbs would
permit; but what a
scene
presented
itself
to her view.
Savage on his knees,
supporting
the bleeding, and
apparently
lifeless
body of Lady Winterton, and
Ossiter
struggling
to
wrest
a
sword
from the hands of her Lord,
who foamed with rage, and threatened
instant
death to
the betrayer of his honour!
Infamous wretch!
said
the enraged
husband
, when
he beheld our heroine; this is your doings, you
contrived
and winked at their meetings, and
most
conveniently
left your vile friend to entertain her lover, while
you whiled away your time with that
disgrace
to
nobility
!
Begoneleave my
house
this nightthou
pest
to
society
! I have long been informed of your
scandalous
proceedings, but would not believe till occular
demonstration
left me nothing to doubt.
Terrified and
distressed
as Rebecca was,
she
could not
but
wish
to
stay
to afford what relief was in her power
to her Lady, but this was denied her. She had
assisted
Savage to bathe her temples with
hartshorn
, and
saw
her
open her eyes, when the
servants
entered, took her in
their arms, and bore her to the
house
, where Rebecca
was forbade to enter, and any
servant
who
should
dare
to afford her
shelter
, threatened with
instant
dismission
.
What now is to become of me!
said
she
,
sinking
on the ground as the door was
shut
against
her: What
next will be the fate of the wretched Rebecca.
Love, affluence, and
pleasure
,
said
Lord
Ossiter
,
endeavouring to
raise
her.
Say rather death and infamy, my Lord; my
reputation
is woundedmy peace of mind
destroyed
. Oh!
that my heart would break, and let me
rest
forever!
Rest
in my arms,
said
he, rudely embracing her.
She
shrieked
.
Forbear, my Lord,
said
Savage, approaching;
this lady has been the friend of my adored Fanny,
and no one
shall
insult
her with impunity.
Your humble
servant
, cried
Ossiter
; I
understand
you, and have done, only give me leave to inform
you, that this pretty imaculate piece of prudery, about
four years
since
, was in a ready
furnished
house
of my
providing, from whence
she
thought fit to elope, and
has, I make no doubt,
seen
a great deal of life
since
that
period.
Rebecca could hear no morea
sudden
chillness
ran
through her veins
she
respired
with difficultyher
head grew giddyand
she
sunk
into
insensibility
. When
she
recovered, recollection retained but faint traces of
the
past
scenes
; it
seemed
like a
disturbed
dream.
Where am I?
said
she
.Lord
Ossiter
approached
the bed-
side
You are in
safety
, my angel,
said
he,
only
compose
your
spirits
, and nothing
shall
be
omitted
that can make you happy. She turned her head
from him, wept, but could not
answer
.
You
must
not
disturb
her,
said
a medical
gentleman
,
who had been called in. Quiet and
rest
is
absolutely
necessary
to
preserve
her life.
Exert your
utmost
skill
, doctor,
said
Ossiter
, to
save
her, and we will be guided entirely by your
directions
.
Then leave her to the care of the
nurse
to-night,
and do not attempt to
see
her before noon to-morrow.
Ossiter
kissed
her hand, bowed, and retired.
Rebecca heard the door
shut
:
she
raised
her head to
look at the doctor, and perceived, to her great joy, he
was a grave, decent looking man. She made
some
excuse
to
send
the
nurse
out of the room; then taking
both the doctor's hands in her's, cried, Oh! good
Sir, if you have any
compassion
in your nature,
shew
it
now to a poor
distressed
orphan and
save
her.
My dear child,
said
he, do not alarm
yourself
,
you are not in any immediate danger.
Oh! Sir, you
mistake
me, it is not death I fear, it
is
dishonour
. Alas! I know not where I am; but I
fear I am entirely in the power of a man who will
sacrifice
me to his unhallowed
passion
.
Then you did not come with him voluntarily?
No! no! heaven knows I did not; I was in a
state
of
insensibility
.
An
interesting
conversation
now took placethe
doctor
was convinced of Rebecca's innocence, and bribing
the
nurse
to
assist
, about twelve o'clock they helped the
poor
sufferer
to get on her clothes,
supported
her down
stairs
, and carried her in triumph to his own
house
.
C H A P. XXXI.
RETROSPECTION AND NEW CHARACTERS.
Though
Lady Winterton had
solemnly
promised
Rebecca to hold no farther
correspondence
with
Savage, her love overpowered every good
resolution
, and
she
had
seen
him
several
times previous to their leaving
London; for what man of gallantry can
refuse
the
request
of a woman he tenderly loves, though rigid
honour
bids him fly her
society
. Fanny, the lovely
unfortunate
Fanny, entreated another interview; it was
impossible
to avoid it, but each one was meant to be the
last
.
Lord
Osster
was by no means the
bosom
friend of
Savage, but he had, by accident, become
master
of this
secret
, and was therefore
requested
to accompany him
to
Chiswick
, where he had enjoyed
several
interviews
with Lady Winterton before the
last
fatal one.
Lord Winterton's valet had
observed
his Lady's
evening
walks, and made the important
discovery
that
she
had a lover. He informed his Lord, from that moment
her
steps
were watched,
she
was
discovered
in the
alcove
Savage
at her feether cheek
rested
on his
forehead
her
hand upon his
shoulder
, and tears were
streaming
from her eyes.
Turn, villain,
said
Lord Winterton, and
desend
yourself
. Savage
arose
, and drew his
sword
; the
frantic Lady threw her arms about him, and received
her
husband
's
sword
in her own
bosom
. She
sell
, and
Ossiter
at that moment entering, prevented the death of
her lover, who would certainly have fallen a victim to
the
husband
's rage, had not timely
assistance
arrived.
The gentle innocent Rebecca was involved in her
Lady's crime;
she
was
supposed
accessary
to the
interviews
,
and forbade to enter the
house
, when
she
fainted
as was mentioned in the preceding chapter.
Ossiter
represented
her to Savage as a woman of a very light
character
,
and he, unwilling to quit a place where he
might hope to hear whether his Fanny
still
lived,
suffered
that
designing
nobleman to carry her to the
chaise
which
waited for them, and convey her to the
nearest
inn.
Here he ordered her to be put to bed,
sent
for a doctor,
and, having
strongly
recommended her to his care,
retired
,
after a
slight
supper
, to bed, rejoicing in an
accident
which had again put in his power a woman
whom, though he had given up all thoughts of gaining,
he could never entirely forget.
How great then was his
surprise
when, enquiring
for her the next morning, he found doctor,
nurse
and
patient, all
absconded
. He repaired to the doctor's
house
, but could not obtain admittance. He
cursed
the meddling fellow in his heart, vowed revenge
against
Rebecca, and
set
off for London.
In the regular cheerful family of Dr. Ryland our
heroine
soon
recovered her health, and in a great
measure
her
spirits
. She made enquiry concerning the fate of
her Lady, and learned that, though
she
had recovered
from her wound,
she
laboured under a very ill
state
of
health, which, they feared, would terminate in a
decline
.
Rebecca gave a
sigh
to her hard fate, and
wished
she
might conquer her
passion
, and be prepared to
meet that peace in another world
she
had failed of
finding
in this.
Dr. Ryland was a truly benevolent man, but he had
a large family, and no great degree of practice, it was
therefore a thing not to be expected that our heroine
could remain with them long, and in the poor
situation
she
then was, without money or cloaths,
she
could not
think of returning to incumber Mrs. Harris. She had
informed Mrs. Ryland that
she
wished
to get a place in
some
genteel family, where
she
could render
herself
useful
without much hard labour; that Lady enquired
among her friends, and learned that the Lady of a
neighbouring
justice
wanted a young
person
to get up her
small
linen, make her caps, bonnets, gowns, &c. and
occasionally
to take care of the family when the Lady
was out. Rebecca joyfully waited on Mrs. Penure; the
kind Mrs. Ryland accompanied her, gave her
such
a
character as
she
deserved
, and had the
pleasure
to find
she
entirely
suited
the Lady's plan. The
salary
was
small
, but Rebecca had but few wants to
supply
; to be
neat was now all
she
required, indeed it was all
she
could
henceforth expect. The doctor advanced a few
guineas
to provide her a change of clothes, for
she
had
sent
repeatedly, without effect, for her trunk from Lord
Winterton's
,
and, in the
course
of a week, from the time
she
waited on the Lady, Rebecca became an inmate in the
family of the
worshipful
Justice
Penure.
Jacob Penure had, from a very low
station
in a
reputable
tradesman
's family,
raised
himself
, by
indefatigable
industry
, to the confidence of his
master
, and a
share
in the
business
, at the age of twenty-three. The fair
Miss
Abigail Prune, who had, in the younger part of
her life,
served
several
ladies in quality of waiting
woman
,
but who now kept her brother's
house
,
cast
on him
the eyes of affection.
Miss
Abigail was to be
sure
rather
past
her prime, having
seen
forty
seasons
revolve, and
noted their various change, without the
least
hope of
ever changing her own maidenly condition to the more
honourable one of wife.
Mr. Jacob was a comely young man. She reviewed
her own countenance in the
glass
;
she
could not but
perceive
the traces made by the hand of time. She was
above the middle
size
, extremely thin, and had a
shape
,
not
small
by degrees, and beautifully
less
; but
so
exactly
straight
, that it was
impossible
to perceive the
least
difference between the bottom and the top, and
instead
of that
roundness
, which
constitutes
elegance in the form
of a woman, her
waist
was as perfectly flat as though
she
had been
pressed
between two boards. Her arms were
long; her hands large, hard and boney; her face was
round, but it was that kind of
roundness
that
expresses
insignificance
. The
small
remains of teeth
she
possessed
might have been termed beautiful in
some
parts of the
world, for they were of jetty hue, and from her hollow
sockets
, over which could be
discerned
scarcely
the trace
of brows, twinkled two extremely
small
black eyes.
The tip of her diminutive
nose
was elevated.
Her complexion might have rivalled the tints of the
most
beautiful orange lilly.
Such was the
person
of
Miss
Abigail. We will leave
her
accomplishments
and temper to
speak
for
themselves
.
Mr. Jacob Penure knew his own
interest
too well to
think of
slighting
the maiden's advances. She had five
hundred pounds in her own
possession
, the accumulated
savings
of near twenty years
servitude
;
besides
, her
brother
had no children, and he had much money. Mr.
Prune was far from
displeased
with his
sister
's choice.
Penure was an attentive,
industrious
young man; he
made him equal partner with
himself
, and in about
fifteen
years they found
themselves
in
possession
of a very
handsome
fortune. About this time the old gentleman
died. All his
possessions
devolved to his
sister
, and
Penure
resolved
, though
sorely
against
his wife's opinion,
to leave trade, and retire into the country. Here he
was
chosen
justice
of the peace, and by his integrity and
gentleness
in the execution of his office, gained the love
of all who knew him.
He was a humane friendly character, but he
stood
in
fear of his wife.
The morning after Rebecca's arrival, the
breakfast
things removed, (for
she
was to eat at their table,) Mrs.
Penure
desired
our heroine to accompany her up
stairs
.
I am mightily glad,
said
the lady,
sitting
down
by a large old-
fashioned
case
of drawers, and taking an
enormous bunch of keys from her pocket, I am
mightily
glad to have met with a young
person
like you, who
can make me up a few
smart
things. I love to be
genteel
,
and wear as good things as my neighbours; but
really it is
so
expensive
to have any thing done at the
milliners
,
and if one gets any journey-woman to come home,
they always
ask
for as much again
stuff
as they want, and
steal
half of it. Now I do hate to be cheated: I don't
mind giving away a bit of ribband or gauze that is left,
but it provokes me to have it taken away
slyly
.
During this harangue,
she
had pulled from her
drawers
an
immense
quantity of yellow
washed
gauze, old
muslin
, and thread lace, that bore the
strongest
marks
of antiquity. She admired the cap our heroine had on,
and
wished
to have one made like it; but among the
medley of trumpery
she
had
displayed
, Rebecca could
not
select
any thing fit for the
purpose
:
besides
, our
heroine's
head, though neat and plain,
still
retained an air
of
fashion
. Mrs. Penure's lank black hair was combed
in the
exactest
manner over a roll, and drawn up as tight
behind as
possible
; how then could the
same
cap
suit
both?However, an attempt
must
be made. The
Lady
assured
Rebecca, that her lace,
muslin
, &c. were
very valuable, and
insisted
on not only one but
several
caps being produced from
those
materials; at the
same
time
she
opened a cabinet, in which were arranged,
rolled
in the
neatest
manner round cards, every ribband
she
had ever had in her
possession
. See, young woman,
said
she
, exultingly, here are variety of ribbands, take
your choice, let my caps be trimmed
handsomely
, but
don't
waste
any; I hate
waste
,
so
, if you can avoid it,
don't cut them. Rebecca could not
suppress
a
smile
at
the
solemn
manner in which this
treasury
of old-
fashioned
dirty, faded ribbands was committed to her charge.
However,
she
promised
to exert her abilities to
please
,
and was beginning to form a cap, but her
mistress
had
not yet done with her. I
suppose
,
said
she
, you
will want linings and wire;
besides
, you will not be all
day making two or three caps: I want a bonnet or two
made, and my
best
cloak
fresh
trimmed.
I am afraid I
shall
not be able to do all in one day,
Madam.
Well, you
must
do as much as you can, child, don't
be idle, I hate idle people. I hope you don't love
reading
.
Rebecca
hesitated
;
she
would not utter a
falsehood
.
I think it an agreeable
amusement
, but I will never
neglect my
business
.
No, indeed, I hope not, reading is the ruination of
all young people. I never read a book in my life but
my Bible, and the
House
-keeper's
Assistant
. I was
always
studying
to make the
most
of my time and how to
save
or earn a penny.
G
A
fresh
cargo was now
displayed
to the wondering eyes
of Rebecca, of old mode, yellow, white
sarsenet
,
skeleton
wires,
paste
board and blond lace, out of which
she
was
desired
to produce a
smart
bonnet or two.
It is
impossible
, madam,
said
she
, utterly
impossible
;
the bonnets worn now are
so
different from
what were worn ten years
since
. You
must
, indeed,
Madam, afford
yourself
new materials to make a genteel
bonnet. Her arguments were vain; all
she
could
obtain
was a yard of mode, and four yards of riband, while
Mrs. Penure declared
she
was leading her into
extravagance
,
and that the bonnet
must
last
her
seven
years.
It is
impossible
to give a direct idea of our heroine's
sensations
, when this
miserable
woman, out of
oftentation
,
displayed
to her the
treasures
of her wardrobe.
Here were gowns, petticoats, nay, even
stockings
and
linen, which
she
could no longer mend or wear,
carefully
laid by her! Her narrow
soul
could not even expand
itself
to give to others what
she
could no longer
use
herself
the very wire that came out of her old caps was
twisted
,
kept and put in a box devoted for that
purpose
; hats
that bore the date of twenty years by their
fashion
; old
stays
,
shoes
and gloves, all were
preserved
, though
scarcely
worth acceptance by the
poorest
person
.
Her
house
-keeping was of a piece with the
rest
; every
thing was under lock and key; bread and
small
beer
were the only things to which the
servants
had free
access
;
her table, it is true, was well
supplied
, but it was
oftentation, not liberality,
occasioned
it. Her female
visitors
were
seldom
asked
to take more than one
glass
of wine after dinner, for when
she
had taken half a
glass
herself
she
would return the
stopper
to the decanter, and
cry, I never allow
myself
more, This was the
signal
,
and the wine was immediately removed, when
she
would
say
, but perhaps, ma'am, you would have liked
another
glass
?
It cannot be expected, in
such
a family, that our
heroine
could be happy;
she
endeavoured to be content,
but the effort was vain. Mr. Penure
saw
she
was far
superior
to the
station
she
was in; he pitied her, but he
could do no more, without incurring the anger of a
woman
whom he had been
accustomed
to obey, and
dreaded
to offend.
It happened one afternoon, when his Lady-wife was
gone to pay a
visit
of ceremony (a thing not very
customary
with him) the
justice
took his tea at home.
Rebecca
was
summoned
to the parlour to make it; but,
alas! Rebecca could produce only a tea
spoonful
of
black tea, and a very
small
quantity of
sugar
.
Why,
sure
, child, you are not allowanced in tea
and
sugar
?
said
he, with a look of
displeasure
.
There is plenty for me, Sir,
said
she
, affecting a
smile
, and.
By heavens!
said
the
justice
,
stamping
with
passion
,
you
shall
make no
excuse
for her; confound the
stingy
narrow-hearted.
Hold, Sir, I
beseech
you, cried Rebecca; you
quite terrify me!
I am
sorry
for it, child,
said
he; but to think
my wife
should
dare treat you thus,
you
who are every
way her
superior
, and who, if I
mistake
not, was born
to be
served
by others, not be a
servant
yourself
!
You are
mistaken
, Sir,
said
our heroine, her eyes
falling as
she
spoke
: Indeed you are
mistaken
. I
am a poor orphan, without friends or connexions, and
have only to lament that my education has been
superior
to my fate. My birth was humble, and, I
trust
, my
heart is humble; but my feelings are
sometimes
more
than I can well bear.
The
justice
rang the bell; he
wished
to hide his
emotions
.
Get me
some
tea and
sugar
,
said
he, giving
half a guinea to a
servant
who entered. He then drew
his chair toward our heroine, took one of her hands,
and told her he felt inclined to prove
himself
her
friend, if
she
would direct by what means to do it.
Be not alarmed, my lovely girl,
said
he, though
my eyes acknowledge you beautiful, my heart only feels
for you as for a
sister
, or a daughter. If you can
venture
to make me your friend, confide in me, and
trust
to
my
honest
intention; I will
serve
you to the
utmost
of
my power.
During tea Rebecca had
disclosed
to her
master
the
chief incidents of her life, veiling only
those
which
concerned
Sir George. Time had
passed
unobserved
. The
justice
had drawn forth his
purse
, and putting ten
guinias
into the hands of Rebecca, entreated her to accept
them as the gift of a father. She
strenuously
opposed
the liberal donation. He had taken her hand, and
closing
it with the money within it, held it while he was
speaking
, when the door opened, and Mrs. Penure
stood
before them. The
justice
started
, and dropped
Rebecca's
hand. The money fell to the floor.
The rage of Mrs. Penure inflamed her features, and
shot
from her eyes;
she
could not
speak
, but
shrieking
in a terrific manner flew at Rebecca, and would have
made her feel the weight of her tremenduous hand, had
not her
husband
stepped
between them. She recovered
her
speech
.
Profligate wretch,
said
she
vile, ungenerous
villain
!
is it thus my
tenderness
and
condescension
, in
taking
you to my bed, is re-paid? Is my money to be
squandered
on your painted Jezabels that you bring into
my
house
to
dishonor
me? Oh! my unfortunate lot!
Must
I beggarred by an ungrateful wretch? Yes, I
see
all my property will be
wasted
, and I
shall
go to the
work-house
.
Here her tears broke out, and what with
sobbing
and
screaming
she
became unintelligible. Rebecca
would not
stop
to vindicate
herself
. She retired to her
room in
silence
, and
soon
after received a
message
from
her
mistress
to leave the
house
, who, at the
same
time,
made her ill behaviour a plea for not paying her wages,
though
she
had been in the family above four months.
As
she
was going out at the gate to
seek
the London
coach, one of the
servants
put a folded paper in her hand.
On opening it
she
saw
not the ten guineas, but a ten
pound note, with
these
words:
I know you have not been paid; accept this as a
small
return for your
services
. God
bless
you, and
make you happy.
J. Penure
.
C H A P. XXXII.
OLD ACQUAINTANCE RENEWED.
The
coach
sat
Rebecca down in Piccadilly; it was
quite dark. She thought it was
best
to go
immediately
to Mrs. Harris's, and determined to take a coach
for that
purpose
. As
she
stood
waiting for her trunk to
be taken from the boot, two genteel young men
passed
her, one of which turned round, and regarding her
attentively
,
it is her, by heavens!
said
he, and flew
towards
her.Rebecca turned
suddenly
round, and
discovered
the features of Sir George Worthy.
My angelic Rebecca!
said
he, folding her in his
arms,
regardless
of the place where they
stood
, do I
once more behold you? Do I indeed
clasp
you to my
breast
, or is it an
illusion
?
Sir George,
said
she
,
struggling
to free
herself
from his embrace, I rejoice to
see
you well; but I
know not what I have done to
deserve
this
insult
.
Who
shall
dare
insult
you, my adorable girl? I
have found you after
such
a long
separation
, when I
thought you
lost
for ever, and we will never part
again.
For heaven's
sake
let me go Sir George. Why
am I thus detained? Are you not married?
By this time a crowd had gathered round them. An
old
sailor
seeing
a woman in
distress
rushed
forward, and
struck
Sir George a blow that made him
relinquish
his
hold. Rebecca
sprang
from him, and forgetful of her
trunk, ran
hastily
down St. James's-
street
. When
she
had reached the bottom
she
stopped
to recover her
breath, and then proceeded
slowly
down Pall-Mall.
A poor
miserable
looking object,
whose
emaciated
frame was but thinly
sheltered
by a tattered mode cloak
for gown
she
had none, from nocturnal damps,
supporing
her feeble
steps
by holding by the iron rails before
G 3
one of the
houses
, in a weak, tremulous voice entreated
charity.
Rebecca never turned
aside
from the
supplications
of
misery
. She
stopped
, and put her hand in her pocket.
They
stood
immediately under two large lamps.
Merciful heaven! cried the poor mendicant,
laying
her cold hand on the one Rebecca had extended
with relief, and gazing ardently at herRebecca!
my child! do you not know me?
Our heroine looked intently on the pale
visage
of the
object before her;
misery
and
sickness
had
somewhat
altered
it, but
she
saw
it was her mother. The feelings
of a daughter
rushed
impetuously
over her heart. She
sunk
on her knees upon the pavement, and,
clasping
her
parent in her arms, exclaimed, Oh, my mother! my
dear
distressed
mother! and
burst
into an agony of tears.
When the tumult of their feelings were
subsided
,
Rebecca
thought of calling a coach, but where were they
to drive? She could not think of taking her mother to
Mrs. Harris's; they therefore drove to a
street
in
Westminster
,
where Mrs. Serl had formerly lodged, and were
fortunate enough to meet with an apartment empty.
Here their mutual embraces and endearments were again
renewed: Rebecca wept for joy at having found a parent
whose
future life
she
would endeavour to make happy,
and Mrs. Serl
shed
tears of contrition for having once
treated
so
unworthily
so
good a daughter.
She informed Rebecca that after they left
Lincolnshire
Serl commenced
gamester
,
sharper
and
swindler
;
that his daughter went on the town, and turned an
abandoned
profligate; and that, at
last
overwhelmed with
poverty
and
disgrace
, Serl
himself
had died in the
digrace">disgrace
, Serl
himself
had died in the
,
leaving her in the
greatest
distress
, having neither
clothes, money, or friends. Her annuity had been long
since
sold
, and
she
must
have
perished
, had
she
not
providentially
met with her daughter.
When Rebecca viewed her mother's tattered
garments
,
and thought of getting her more comfortable
clothing
,
her own trunk recurred to her memory. I hope
it is not
lost
,
said
she
; and it is lucky what little
money I
possess
is in my pocket.
Her mother informed her that there was
some
decent
apparel at a pawn broker's in the neighbourhood, and
Rebecca, having received
instructions
in what manner to
proceed, went out in order to get it; but what was her
astonishment
, on opening the parcel when
she
had
brought it home, to
see
a gown made of a piece of
India
chints, which
she
remembered to have had in her
trunk when it was
sent
into
Lincolnshire
, with a
muslin
apron, and
several
other things, which
she
equally knew
to be her own.
Gracious heaven!
said
she
, dropping the parcel
from her hands, and fixing her eyes on her mother.
What is the matter, my dear?
said
Mrs. Serl;
that was a gown given me by poor Serl; it had been
bought for his
first
wife.
It was mine,
said
Rebecca, in a firm voice. If
he told you it was his, he told a
falshood
; it was in the
trunk which I
lost
four years ago.
An explanation now took place, which convinced
Mrs. Serl what a villain
she
had
chosen
to
succeed
the
worthy Mr. Littleton; but our heroine would not
suffer
her to make any painful
retrospects
, or to
accuse
herself
.
She poured the
sweet
balm of affectionate
consolation
into
the
bosom
of her mother. She forgot her own
forrows
,
and
seemed
to have no with but to render her
parent
the like forgetful of every
past
disagreeable
event.
The next morning
she
repaired to the
house
where the
stage
had
stopped
in Piccadilly to enquire for her trunk.
The old gentleman took it away with him,
said
one of the waiters, and paid all expences; for
Rebecca
,
in her fright the preceding night, had not paid her
fare to town.
What old gentleman?
said
she
,
surprised
.
Why, the old gentleman who knocked the young
man down that was
so
rude to you. He read the
directions
on the trunk when it was taken from the boot,
swore
he was your uncle, and
insisted
on having it; as
he offered to pay all expences the coachman did not
refuse
,
and both he and the young man went off together
G 4
to
search
for you; but returned in about an hour, and
left word, if you
should
call this morning, for me to tell
you, you might hear of your trunk at number 46,
Bedford-Square
.
That is Lord
Ossiter
's,
said
Rebecca,
scarcely
able to
respire
.
And, moreover,
said
the man, the young
gentleman
told me, if I could find where you was gone, or
could bring him to a
sight
of you, he would give me ten
guineas, and
so
,
seeing
as how you are here, we had
better
take a coach and go together.
No,
said
Rebecca,
struggling
to
suppress
her
emotions
,
No, I cannot go
just
now; in the afternoon it
will be more convenient. I will
just
step
back to my
lodgings, and return to you again by two o'clock.
The man was
satisfied
. Rebecca tripped out of the
house
, called a coach, and drove home. During her
little
ride her mind dwelt on the
singularity
of the
circumstance
.
She had
just
heard the man, who
rescued
her
from Sir George's
insults
, had gone away with him, had
taken her trunk, and directed her to find it at Lord
Ossiter's
.
It was an inexplicable riddle; he had called
himself
her uncle, but
she
knew
she
had but one uncle and
he was abroad in the navy. She was certainly
fortunate
in
escaping
a
snare
, which
she
had no doubt was
laid to trepan her. Lord
Ossiter
had, perhaps,
represented
her to Sir George as an abandoned creature, devoid
of virtue or principal; and that gentleman, once
so
esteemed
,
so
respected
, was now
considered
as one, who,
believing her
lost
to honour, would join his
Lordship
in any
stratagem
to decoy her into his power.
Full of
these
ideas,
she
told her mother
she
would
immeadiately remove from the apartments
she
then
occupied
,
lest
she
should
have been watched home, and
Sir George might be directed where to find her.
Alas! my dear mother,
said
she
, I am
sensible
of my own
weakness
. I hope I love virtue as well as
woman ought; but I know I love Sir George, and
though he is the
husband
of another; though
reason
,
religon
,
honour, all plead
against
my
passion
,
still
,
still
it
is
so
engraven on my heart, that to eradicate it, I feel
is totally
impossible
. Can I then
answer
for my own
fortitude? I fear not: I might
sink
under powerful
temptations; let me then fulfil my duty, and avoid
them.
Her mother approved and
strengthened
these
resolutions
,
and, having but very few things to put
together
,
in
less
than two hours they were in a new lodging
near Millbank,
Wettminster
. Here Rebecca
sunk
under
the fatigue of body, and agitation of mind
she
had
undergone
,
and a fever
ensued
, which brought her
almost
to the brink of the grave. The
strength
of a good
constitution
soon
combated the violence of the
disorder
, and
she
began to recover her
strength
, when her mother was
attacked with one more alarming; this was the
smallpox
,
which, to a
person
of her years, was expected to
be fatal.
Ten pounds was all the worldly wealth Rebecca
possessed
when
she
met her mother; but ten pounds in a
house
of
sickness
would
last
but a very
short
time;
she
,
therefore on examining the contents of her
purse
, when
her mother
sickened
, found it contained but fifteen
shillings
,
and there was a doctor's bill to pay. It was
also
necessary
his attendance
should
be continued to Mrs.
Serl,
whose
life was in imminent danger. During the
first
ten days of her mother's
illness
Rebecca hardly left
her
bedside
, denying
herself
almost
the
necessaries
of
life, in order to lengthen out her little
store
; but on the
fourteenth day
she
was pronounced out of danger, and
that good
nursing
, and
nourishing
food, was all that was
necessary
to her
restoration
.
Alas!
said
Rebecca, I have no
possible
means
of procuring
those
necessary
comforts. She was
stooping
,
as
she
spoke
, to take
some
gruel from the fire, the
pin of her handkercheif dropped out, and the picture of
Lady Mary
swung
forward
against
her hand.
Rebecca gazed at it mournfully.True,
said
she
, it is
set
in gold, and might afford a temporary
supply
; but, then, is it not the portrait of my adored
benefactress
? And does it not
also
contain the
semblance
of the only man I ever did or ever can love? Duty
alas! what right have I to talk of love? Is he not
already
married? And were he not, have I not given a
solemn
vow never to
listen
to his
addresses
?
Foolish
,
foolish
, Rebecca! why
dost
thou
nourish
a
passion
that
must
be forever
hopeless
?
She was returning the picture to her
bosom
, when it
struck
her
she
might, perhaps, get the minature carefully
taken out, and
dispose
of the gold in which they were
set
. If
so
,
said
she
, I may comfort my mother,
and yet
preserve
the
respect
due to the portrait of Lady
Mary.
CHAP. XXXIII.
THE BENEVOLENT LADY.
Rebecca
was
so
pleased
with the project of
raising
a
supply
of money from the gold, that
she
told her
mother
she
would go out for half an hour and breathe the
fresh
air, as
she
found the confinement
she
had
suffered
rather impeded her returning
strength
. When
she
was
out
she
thought, by extending her walk,
she
should
feel
herself
refreshed
,
she
therefore
crossed
the Park, and
going
out at Spring Gardens Gate,
stopped
at an eminent
goldsmith
's in
Cockspur
-
street
, and
requested
him to
take the pictures carefully out, and
purchase
the
setting
.
The man had
just
taken it in his hand, and was admiring
the
neatness
of the
workmanship
, and the curious
contrivance
of the
spring
, when a chariot
stopped
at the
door, and a beautiful young Lady immediately entered.
The
master
of the
shop
held the picture open in his
hand while he received the Lady's orders concerning a
pair of bracelets. The portrait caught her eye:
Bless
me,
said
she
, Pray
whose
is that? it is
so
like a
person
that I know.
It belongs to that young woman, Madam;
she
wishes
to
sell
the gold without the pictures.
The Lady had not before
observed
Rebecca; but now
her pale, but beautiful
interesting
countenance
struck
her.
It is a pity to have them
unset
,
said
she
. Will
you part with it altogether? I will give you twice the
value of the gold.
I cannot, indeed, part with the portraits, Madam;
the one is a much valued friend long
since
dead, and the
other. A pale vermillion
crossed
her cheek, and
she
hesitated
.
Aye, that other!
said
the Lady; I never
saw
any thing more like than that is to a particular friend
of mine; and even the features of the Lady
seem
familiar
to me.
Will you buy the gold, Sir?
said
Rebecca.
No, cried the Lady, he
shall
not buy it. If
you will not part with it altogether to me for twice its
value, (I am certain you will pardon the remark) but
one motive could lead you to
wish
to
dispose
of the
setting
.
As
she
was
speaking
she
had taken
several
guineas
from her
purse
, and wrapped them in paper. You
shall
call upon me, if you
please
, to-morrow morning,
continued
she
,
presenting
our heroine with a card, under
which
she
slipped
into her hand the paper of money, and
without waiting for an
answer
,
she
tripped out of the
shop
. Rebecca was
motionless
; nor did
she
think of
looking at the card till the
master
of the
shop
returned
from
seeing
the Lady to her carriage.
I am glad you were
so
lucky,
said
he, as to
excite
the notice of that Lady;
she
is an amiable woman,
and may prove a valuable friend.
Lady Chatterton,
said
Rebecca, reading the card.
Yes, continued he,
she
was Lady Eleanor
Harcourt
,
only daughter of the late Earl. She has been
married about three years. A
most
extraordinary
circumstance
happened about that time;
she
had been from
a child
designed
for her
cousin
, Sir George.
Just
then a carriage drew up,
several
Ladies of
fashion
demanded the jeweller's attention, and Rebecca,
thinking
her mother might want her attendance, left the
shop
,
not without
wishing
she
could have heard what Sir
George the Lady was
designed
for, as that was a name
she
never heard mentioned, but
she
felt
interested
, and
found it
impossible
to
suppress
the emotions of her heart.
Rebecca was truly grateful for the unexpected bounty
she
had received, and returned home fully
resolved
to
wait on the benevolent Lady, and return her
those
thanks her
astonishment
had prevented her
expressing
at
the time: But on the morrow her mother was
so
very
ill it was
impossible
to leave her, and for
several
succeeding
days it rained continually: However, at length
a fine morning
presented
, Mrs. Serl was greatly
recovered
,
and Rebecca,
dressing
herself
as neatly as the very
limited
state
of her wardrobe would allow, proceeded to
St. Alban's-
street
.
On knocking at the door
she
was informed, that
Lady Chatterton was gone out for a morning ride; but
that, if
she
was the young woman her
Ladyship
had met
at the jeweller's,
she
was
desired
to wait till the Lady
returned.
Rebecca was
pleased
with this little mark of
attention
,
and was
shewn
into a
small
parlour, where a child,
of about eleven years old was
practising
on the
pianoforte
.
The child
stopped
on her entrance, and,
starting
from her
seat
, advanced a few
steps
towards Rebecca.
Do not let me interrupt you
Miss
,
said
our
heroine
.
Oh! but I am
sure
I cannot play, ma'am,
said
the
child: Indeed I cannot; I had much rather look at
you. And pray ma'am, do not think me rude if I
ask
you if your name is not Rebecca Littleton?
That is my name,
said
the
astonished
Rebecca.
I knew, I was
sure
, it could be no other,
said
the
child, throwing her arms round our heroine's neck;
but you have forgot meyou do not remember your
little Lucy
Ossiter
.
Miss
Ossiter
!
Yes, your own little girl that loveed you
so
dearly,
and
almost
broke her poor heart when you went away:
But you
shall
not go away again, Rebecca; my dear
aunt will not let you go: I know the will not.
What aunt, my dear young Lady?
Why aunt Eleanor: I live with aunt Eleanor now.
Papa and mamma are gone to France, and brothers are
both at
school
;
so
uncle George.Oh! dear Rebecca,
I have got
such
a deal to tell you about uncle George.
I am
sure
aunt will be very glad to
see
you, uncle and
she
are gone out together.
Good heaven! thought Rebecca, then I am in
the very
house
I
most
wished
to avoid. No wonder her
Ladyship
said
she
knew the picture; but now is my
only
time for avoiding a painful interview with Sir George,
who has, no doubt, though it did not
strike
me before,
succeeded
to his uncle's title on his marriage with his
cousin
. Honour, gratitude, all unite to urge me
immediately
to quit this place. Lady Chatterton has
extended
toward me the hand of benevolence; nor will I repay
her by throwing
myself
in the way of her
husband
, who,
from his behaviour when we met accidentally, has
convinced
me he
still
retains an improper regard for me.
As my Lady is not at home, my dear
Miss
Ossiter
,
said
she
, I will call again another time.
Well, then, let it be
soon
, my own Rebecca;
say
you will come again to-morrow.
Rebecca tenderly embraced the affectionate child, and
having given her a kind of half
promise
to
see
her
soon
again,
hastily
left the
house
.
Every thing,
said
she
,
conspires
against
me. I
never find a friend but
some
cross
accident prevents my
reaping any benefit from their
kindness
: misfortunes
seem
to be the only portion allotted for me in this world,
and patience and
resignation
my only comforters. But I
will nor complain; I have been unexpectedly relieved
when
almost
in
despair
, when every earthly friend had
apparently
forsaken
me; and, I
trust
, I
shall
be
supported
by the
same
beneficient Power, as long as he
thinks proper to lay the burthen of life upon me.
As
she
walked along, indulging
these
reflections, it
struck
her that
she
would go to her uncle's agent, and
enquire when he had heard from him, and whether the
old gentleman was
soon
expected in England. But
when
she
got to the place where he
used
to
reside
,
she
found he was removed to a
distant
part of the town;
nor could the people, who then occupied the
house
,
give her a proper direction to find him.
Now every
stay
is gone,
said
Rebecca, as
she
pursued
her way homeward; but, I thank God, I
feel my health returning, and, I
shall
be enabled to gain,
by
industry
at
least
, the
necessaries
of life for my mother
and
self
. Alas! poor Rebecca,
she
little knew how
small
a portion of the world's wealth fell to the
share
of
the humble, the
industrious
female, who by continued
labour can
scarcely
gain
sufficient
to
supply
, with the
coarsest
food, the wants of nature, or to
shield
with
decent
clothing her limbs from the inclemency of the
weather
.
While the daughters of vice and folly are
surrounded
with luxuries, the
superfluous
part of which would cheer
the hearts of the children of
misery
; but, Oh!
heavenly
reflection, the humble, virtuous female, has a
sweet
cordial comforter within that
diffuses
a
pleasure
over her
soul
, which the
thoughtless
votary of folly can never
experience.
Blest
spirit
of content that
presides
over the innocent
breast
! How enviable are thy
transports
! Thou
canst
sweeten
the
coarse
scanty
meal of poverty, and
shed
quiet
slumbers
on the
prisoner
's eye! The
accutest
pang the
heart can feel where thou
hast
taken up thine abode, is
when it beholds its fallen
sisters
purchasing
the
delusive
pleasures
of wealth with the
loss
of all that can render
them lovely or amiable.
Rebecca was poor, but her heart was void of
discontent
.
She enquired for employment, and was
so
happy
as to procure
some
; but the fruits of her
almost
incessant
industry
were very inadequate to the wants of
herself
and
mother, who revived but very
slowly
from the bed of
sickness
.
CHAP. XXXIV.
WE GO BACK TO THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER.
When
Sir George Worthy left England, in order,
if
possible
, to
banish
from his remembrance
Rebecca
Littleton, he had, previous to his departure,
visited
his
cousin
Eleanor, and informed her of the
state
of his
heart.
I
esteem
you, Eleanor,
said
he; but I do not love
you as a man ought to love a woman he takes for his
wife. To be candid, my heart is in the
possession
of
another
.
And to be equally candid, dear George, replied
the lady, mine is exactly in the
same
predicament; yet
I do not know how we
shall
avoid making each other
wretched, for my father
positively
swears
I
shall
have you
or be a beggar, and my poor
swain
has neither name or
fortune to recommend him.
I mean to be
absent
two years,
said
Sir George,
that will give you a
short
reprieve. I will write to
you often, and if at any time I can be of
service
to the
man of your choice, do not
hesitate
to command me.
In the Earl of Chatterton's family was a young man
nearly of the
same
age with Eleanor; he was a foundling,
and had been brought up and educated by his
lordship
in
the
style
of a gentleman, and when at a proper age
presented
with a
commission
.
Oakly, which was the name the Earl had given him
from having found him one morning at the foot of an
oak in his park, wrapped in a mantle, but without any
other cloathing. Oakly was a youth of
strict
honour,
and his heart overflowed with gratitude to his benefactor,
whom he
considered
in the light of a father; but
inspite
of honour, gratitude, and innumerable
resolutions
to the
contrary, he loved Lady Eleanor,
some
how or other
accidentally
acquainted her with his
passion
, and found
himself
beloved in return.
Things were in this
situation
when Sir George left
England
,
and in this
situation
remained when a letter from
Eleanor
summoned
him to return, when he had been
scarcely
absent
eighteen months. The Earl was ill, felt
himself
daily declining, and
wished
to
see
his daughter
married before he died. He obeyed the
summons
in
haste
.
Oakly was
almost
distraction
. But what am I,
said
he, that I
should
aspire
to the hand of my
patron's
daughter, an out
cast
, a foundling, without
family
or name, dependant on his bounty even for the
bread I eat? No, I will not impede her union with a
man every way her equal, who
possesses
honour and
goodness
of heart, and will do
justice
to her virtues. I
will leave England,
said
he.
Unable to deliberate on a
subject
where inclination
and
reason
were
so
much at variance, he flew to the Earl,
and
solicited
an exchange into a regiment
destined
to
America. Let me gather laurels in the field of battle,
my dear Sir,
said
he.
The Earl loved him tenderly. He
pressed
to know
the
cause
of this unexpected application, and
refused
to
exert his
interest
in Oakly's behalf till he was informed.
I love a woman of family and fortune,
said
he,
I have
some
reason
to think I am not indifferent to her,
and, knowing my own unfortunate
situation
, I
wish
to
avoid doing a
dishonourable
action.
You will never act
dishonourable
, Oakly,
said
the
Earl, and this conduct is a proof of it. Who is the
Lady?inform me I will
speak
to her friends
in your favour, and give you a genteel fortune.
Oh! my generous benefactor, cried Oakly,
indeed
it is
impossible
; her parents never will
consent
. I
dare not name her.
Come, come, you are too diffident: I am
sure
there
is no family, of the
least
discernment
, but would think
themselves
honoured by the alliance. Come, who is the
paragon?
You
must
pardon me, Sir; I
should
entirely forfeit
your
friendship
.
You will undoubtedly forfeit it by this unkind
reserve
.
I am willing and able to
serve
you, Oakly; but
if, by your
obstinacy
, you put it out of my power .
Do not call it
obstinacy
. By heavens! Oakly, I
love you as my own child; only tell me how to make
you happy, and I will do it, though it
cost
half I am
possessed
of.
Ah! my dear Sir, I fear, when you know .
Know what? cried the Earl, impatiently.
That I love Lady Eleanor.
Love Eleanor! cried he, emphatically; then your
suit
is indeed
hopeless
.
Oakly's heart
sunk
within him.
You are indeed a noble boy, though,
said
the
Earl, and from this moment I hold
myself
bound, by
the
most
sacred
oath, never to
suffer
you to know the
want of a friend. Eleanor has, from her childhood,
been
designed
for her
cousin
George; indeed, my late
sister
and
myself
entered into a
solemn
engagement, that
which ever outlived the other
should
see
this union
completed
;
that now is my
task
. If it is
absolately
necessary
to your peace to leave England, I will procure
you the
desired
exchange; but I could
wish
, my dear
Oakly, you would conquer your
passion
, and remain
with us.
That is not in my power, Sir; he replied, to
be employed in actual
service
is now the only
wish
I
have to make.
The Earl did not mention this
conversation
to either
his daughter or Sir George, and Oakly carefully
avoided
an interview with Eleanor till he was really appointed
to a company of foot that was expected to go for
New-York
in the
course
of a few weeks. He then, having
made the
necessary
preparations for joining his regiment,
took a tender leave of her,
assuring
her it was his hope
to
ensure
her felicity by
banishing
from her fight a
wretch who had
stepped
between her and her duty, and
who would rather die than have it
said
he had
basely
stolen
the daughter of the man to whom he owed every
enjoyment
,
nay,
almost
life
itself
.
'Tis all in vain,
said
Eleanor, I can never love
Sir George; nor do I think even the commands of a
father
I love and revere can lead me to give him my hand.
However, the preparations for the intended nuptials
still
proceeded. Sir George beheld them with total
indifference
.
He had
used
every endeavour to
discover
Rebecca: he had, by various
stratagems
, traced her to
her embarkation with
Miss
Abthorpe for America, and
was informed the
vessel
in which they went was reported
to have been
lost
, and all on board
perished
.
Rebecca
lost
! He remembered his mother's
first
wish
to
see
Lady Eleanor his wife. She is an amiable
woman,
said
he, and though I cannot love again
with the
emhusiastic
ardour I experienced for Rebecca,
I will, if
she
voluntarily accepts my hand, exert
myself
to make her happy. She, like
myself
, has experienced
disappointment
in her
tenderest
hopes; we can at
least
console
each other, and make up in
friendship
what we
want in love.
Oakly had taken leave of his friends at Windfor, and
was on his journey for
Portsmouth
. Sir George was in
town with the lawyers, and the Earl and Lady Eleanor
at
breakfast
in the library, when a
servant
informed them
that a clergyman
requested
to
speak
with them.He
was
desired
to walk up.
I am come, my Lord,
said
he,
seating
himself
with evident
embarrassment
, from a poor woman in
this place, who, it is imagined, is at the point of death.
From
something
she
has imparted to me, I imagine it
is
absolutely
necessary
for your
Lordship
to pay her a
visit
,
as
she
has a
circumstance
to relate which nearly
concerns
your family. She is likewife in
distressed
circumstances
,
and may, while
she
lives, which will not be
long, require your benevolent
assistance
.
The Earl never wanted to be twice told of an object
of
compassion
.
We will go directly,
said
he, and ringing the bell,
ordered the carriage. Lady Eleanor and the clergyman
accompanied him.
At a
small
cottage, on the extremity of the
forest
, the
carriage
stopped
, and the clergyman led the way into an
inner apartment, where, on a bed,
expressive
of poverty
in the extreme, lay a poor emaciated figure, in the
last
stage
of a
consumption
.
Here is the Earl and his daughter, Mrs. Watts,
said
he.
They are very good, replied
she
, to come and
see
such
a wretch as I am. Oh! Sir, Oh! my Lady,
you will never forgive me; but I cannot die in peace till
I have informed you that, through mine and my
sister
's
wickedness
, you have
nourished
an
impostor
in your
families
,
and that the real heir to the late Sir George
Worthy's
esta
e is either totally
lost
, or may be a poor
wanderer
,
destitute
of bread.
The Earl and Eleanor
sat
in mute
astonishment
,
gazing
at each other.The clergyman exhorted the
penitent
to proceed.
My
eldest
sister
,
said
she
, was employed by the
late Lady Worthy to wet-
nurse
her
son
, and was left at
Twickenham with the child, while her
Ladyship
made
a
short
tour to Flanders. During her Lady's
absence
my
sister
came to
Windsor
to me, bringing
master
with her.
I at that time gave
suck
to a
sweet
little boy exactly of
the
same
age,
whose
mother had died at my
house
but a
month before. My
sister
entreated me to take care of
master
Worthy for a day, while
she
went to town. I
consented
, and was proud of my charge. In the
afternoon
(he was
asleep
in the cradle) I left a little girl to
rock him, and
stepped
about half a mile to
purchase
something
for
supper
against
my
sister
came home. I
made what
haste
I could, but on my return, what was
my terror, to
see
the cradle empty, and my girl at play
in the
street
? However, I did not make any
noise
, or
alarm the neighbourhood; but enquiring of the girl who
had been there,
she
said
only two
gypsey
women
begging
.
It immediately occurred to me, that the gold
bells and coral, together with the
costly
lace cap and jam
the child had on, had been the incitement to this theft.
When my
sister
returned
she
was
almost
distracted
her
character would be gone
she
should
never dare face
her Lady again! That evening we could think of
nothing
in order to deprecate the
strom
we
should
expect on
my Lady's return, till the diabolical thought
presented
itself
of
substituting
my little
nursling
,
whose
features
and complexion were nearly the
same
, in the room of
master
Worthy, quieting our
consciences
with the ides,
that, as his mother was dead, and his father poor, and
talked of going abroad, it would be doing a deed of
charity
,
and that, if we
should
ever find the
lost
insant
, we
might then acknowledge the fraud. Accordingly my
sister
returned to Twickenham with the child, the plan
succeeded
beyond our expectations, for we feared the
penetration
of the
servants
, and I wrote to the father of the
boy that his child was dead.
And who is it then, cried the enraged Earl,
whom you have thus
infamously
palmed upon the
family
for the
son
of my
sister
, and who was within a few
days to have been married to my daughter?
His father's name was George Littleton,
she
replied
,
faintly, and he was
christened
after him.
And have you never heard any thing of my poor
cousin
?
said
Eleanor, tenderly.
Never, Madam; but
should
he ever be found, he has
on his right arm,
just
below the
shoulder
, the mark of a
mulberry.
Saddle my
horses
send
off all my
servants
,
said
the Earl,
starting
up; he
shall
not go to that dd
fighting place.
My dear father! cried Eleanor.
Rejoice, rejoice, my girl, for upon my
soul
the
young dog had that mark on his arm when I found him
sprawling
under the oak.
And is he alive, then?
said
the poor woman.
Thank Godthen I
shall
die content.
Eleanor
selt
interested
in the
sate
of the poor creature,
who had made this important
discovery
. She
promised
to befriend her while
she
lived, and to take care of her
daughter, a girl about fifteen years old. She then
returned
home with her father, who immediately
dispatched
a
messenger
to bring his new-
sound
nephew to town
again.While Eleanor retired to her apartment to
reflect
on the alteration a few hours had made, and how
much it had brightened her future
prospects
.
George Littleton, as we
must
now call him, however
conscious
of his innocence, felt greatly hurt at being
so
long the
usurper
of another's name and property; but the
Earl would not
suffer
him to dwell on that
subject
, and
on his marriage with Lady Eleanor. Sir George
presented
his quandom rival with the writings of an
estate
, worth
five hundred pounds a year, given to him and his heirs
for ever; and
so
fond were they of his
society
, that it was
but a
small
part of every year he
spent
from them.
The Earl did not long
survive
his daughter's marriage,
and Sir George
succeeded
to the title of Earl of
Chatterton
,
the Earl having begged the
reversion
of it for him
some
time previous to his death.
Mr. Littleton had given up all hopes of ever again
hearing of Rebecca.He imagined her dead, but her
image was
so
deeply engraven on his heart, that he
resolved
never to enter into the married
state
. Sometimes
he would think
she
might, perhaps, have been his
sister
,
for he had never heard her father's
Christian
name, but
his heart recoiled from this
suggestion
She was
undoubtedly
a relation, yet he had never heard Rebecca
mention an uncle, but
she
might have many; he had
never
made many enquiries concerning her family.
One evening, when he was at a
sopper
-party with
Lord
Ossiter
, that nobleman
addressed
him with,
George, I
saw
an old acquaintance of your's
last
night.
Ah, now I think of it,
she
may be a relation.
Who do you mean my Lord?
Who! why who but that demure, primitive piece of
affected innocence, Mrs. Rebecca Littleton.
You
must
be
mistaken
, my Lord: I have every
reason
to think
she
has been dead
some
years.
And I have
substantial
reasons
to think
she
was alive
last
night, and in my arms.
He then gave an account of the affair at Lord
Winterton's
,
little to the honour of hour heroine. He
also
averred
,
that
she
voluntarily accompanied him in a
chaise
to a
neighbouring town, where
she
spent
the night at an inn,
but left it in the morning with a
person
whom he
imagined
she
liked better.
Poor girl,
said
George, mentally, heavy
must
have been the trials that drove her to a life of infamy.
From that time he frequented every place where he
supposed
it likely to meet with her. I will
snatch
her
from perdition,
said
he. She
shall
share
my little
portion, eat of my bread, and drink of my cup. I will
speak
consolation
to a mind that was once as pure as
angels
,
and cannot without infinite pain, be intimate with
vice.
About this time Lord
Ossiter
's extravagance had
so
envolved his
estates
, that it was
necessary
he
should
make
a trip to the Continent in order to retrieve them. George
undertook to
settle
all his debts, and put the
estates
under
proper regulations, and to this
purpose
took up his
residence
in Bedford-Square. He had been dining out,
where the champaigne flew
briskly
round, when he
accidentally
met our heroine
just
descended
from the
stage
.
The wine gave him a great
slow
of
spirits
, which, added
to the relation he had heard from Lord
Ossiter
, accounts
for the rude manner in which he
accosted
her.
The blow he received from the old
sailor
almost
stunned
him: However, he followed him into the
house
, and
insisted
on
satisfaction
for the
insult
, as he termed it. The
old man
swore
it was a blow given in a right
cause
, and
that he was ready to give him a dozen more if he was
not already
satisfied
.
During this altercation the coachman came in with
Rebecca's trunk, and
asked
where the young woman
was to pay him his fare?
She is ran off,
said
a man who
saw
the
transaction
.
Well then,
says
the coachman, I
must
keep the
trunk for what
she
owes. As he
spoke
he
rested
one
end of it on a chair near a table, on which
stood
a
candle
.
The old
sailor
looked at the directions, rubbed his
eyes, and looked again. By all that's good,
said
he,
it is my own girl, my Rebecca?Which way did
she
go? Let me follow her. Stand out of my way.
Not till you have paid me,
said
the coachman,
surlily
.
The old man threw down five
shillings
, and
desiring
a waiter to take care of the trunk, ran out, followed by
George; but,
instead
of turning into Pall-Mall, they
went through the Palace into the Park, their
search
was
therefore vain.
As they returned
slowly
together, George
asked
the
old man if he was any relation to
Miss
Littleton?
Yes,
said
he, I am all the relation
she
has in
the world, and a
devilish
poor one too, for I have not
above half a guinea at this
present
time in my pocket.
I have not been in London above two hours, nor in
England above eight and forty.
Is your name Littleton, Sir?
So my mother told me: I
suppose
she
knew.
Pardon me if I am
troublesome
; but had you ever
a
son
?
Yes, but he died an infant.
You were informed he died at
Windsor
?
The old man
answered
in the affirmative.
Ah! my dear Sir,
said
George, you were
deceived
your
son
still
liveslongs eagerly to embrace
youand divide with you the competence he enjoys.
By this time they had returned to the public-
house
.
George called for a room, knelt before his father, and
related to him all the reader is already acquainted with.
What wonder if, in the delightful hurry of
spirits
this
discovery
occasioned
, they did not think of the
necessity
of writing a note for Rebecca, in
case
she
came to
enquire
for her trunk; but,
satisfied
with leaving a verbal
message
, they repaired to Bedford-
square
, to enjoy the
pleasures
of an uninterrupted
conversation
.
CHAP. XXXV.
DISAPPOINTMENT.
The
next morning Rebecca,
so
dear to both their
hearts, recurred to their imaginations; George
beheld her in want, plunged in infamy, the horrors of
which her
susceptible
heart
severely
felt, and from which
she
could by no means extricate
herself
.
She may be in want,
said
his father; but I'll
be dd if
she
is infamous. I know the dear girl,
George, and I'd
stake
my life upon her innocence. He
then gave his
son
an account of the manner in which he
found her in America, of the
respect
and
esteem
she
created
wherever
she
was known, and how much
she
was
beloved
by Colonel Abthorpe's family. But let us go to
the
house
where the coach
stopped
, continued he;
she
will
most
likely call there to get her trunk.
They went out together, and entered the
house
just
ten
minutes after Rebecca had left it.
Disappointed
and
grieved, unable by any means to trace which way
she
had
gone, and fearing
she
would be
distressed
by the
loss
of
her trunk, which might contain all her wordly
possessions
,
they returned heavily home, and
resolved
to
advertise
it.
This they immediately did in
several
papers, in
such
a
manner as it was
impossible
for Rebecca not to know it
was
herself
that was meant, though only the initials of
the name were
used
; but Rebecca never
saw
the papers,
and the repeated
advertisements
were
fruitless
.
George had introduced his father to Lord and Lady
Chatterton; but, thought Rebecca had been once or twice
mentioned before that Lady, he had always avoided
entering
into explanations, and Lady Chatterton did not
know that
she
was the woman George had
so
long
loved
;
for though, in the earlier part of their intimacy, he
had frequently declared that his heart was engaged, he
had never
said
to whom, or whether
she
was above or
beneath him in rank; but
simply
said
, he had no hope of
being united to her.
On the day Lady Chatterton had met Rebecca at the
jeweller's,
she
mentioned the
circumstance
at dinner
time. George and his father that day dined with them.
I wanted to buy it of her,
said
she
, for one of the
pictures was
so
like George Littleton, and the other was
a Lady, but I do not recollect who, though I think, I
have
seen
the features before.
Good heavens!
said
George, I am certain it
could only be Rebecca
herself
.
I
wish
it may,
said
the Lady;but I did not
think of it at the time I
saw
her: however, I have
appointed
her to come here to-morrow.
How did the poor girl look?
said
old Mr.
Littleton
.
Very pale, replied the Lady, and, I fear, is
much
distressed
by the agitation
she
discovered
in her
countenance, and her
visible
reluctance to part with the
picture.
Oh! my poor
lost
Rebecca,
said
George, and,
rising
hastily
from table, left the room, to give vent to
those
emotions he could no longer
suppress
.
Rebecca, in
distress
, offering, with evident reluctance
the gold that enveloped his portrait to
sale
, convinced
him he
still
retained a tender place in her remembrance;
once to have been beloved by Rebecca would have been
his
highest
wish
now
she
was contaminated
lost
to
virtue
!
And, though
still
inexpressibly
dear to his heart,
she
could never be his wife; yet
she
might be innocent.
Lord
Ossiter
was not a man of the
strictest
veracity. He
would have given worlds for an interview with her, and
unable to wait the
issue
of the morning, when
she
was
expected
in St. Alban's-
street
, he obtained from Lady
Chatterton
a direction to the jeweller, and
hastened
to
hatened">hastened
to
,
in hopes to be able through him to trace out
her place of abode; but the jeweller had never
seen
her
before, and had hardly thought of her
since
. He could
give him no information.
Those
only who have felt the pangs of
suspence
can
imagine the anxiety of Mr. Littleton and George during
the night. The next morning they repaired early to St.
H
Alban's-
street
, but the day
passed
and no Rebecca
appeared
.
Another and another morning came, and
still
brought with them
disappointment
.
She will never come,
said
George.The poor
girl is
conscious
of her unhappy
situation
, and
shame
prevents
her taking advantage of Lady Chatterton's offers
of
service
. Mr. Littleton began to be of the
same
opinion
;
but the benevolent Lady Chatterton never went
out without leaving orders with her porter, that,
should
Rebecca call,
she
might be
desired
to wait till her
return
.
I will
myself
,
said
she
, have the
pleasure
of
presenting
her to her uncle. She
shall
not be
hastily
informed that he is in England, left it
should
overpower
her
spirits
, and if I find her worthy, I will give her to
her amiable
cousin
, and make her a fortune worth his
acceptance
.
But unfortunately
Miss
Ossiter
's joy, the
effusions
of
which was mingled with incoherent intelligence
concerning
her uncle's, marriage, prevented poor Rebecca from
reaping any benefit from her
Ladyship
's kind intentions
in her behalf.
George Littleton had accompanied Lord and Lady
Chatterton in their morning ride. They returned
together
.
Miss
Ossiter
came running to them as they entered
the parlour.
Oh! dear aunt, who do you think has been here
the
greatest
stranger
! I do not think you know her; but
I told her I was
sure
you would be glad to
see
her.
Why, who was it, my love?
said
her
Ladyship
,
seating
herself
.
Why, it was my own Rebecca Littleton; I knew
her in a minute, though
she
is
so
pale and thin.
And where is
she
?
said
George,
almost
choaked
with
rising
emotions!
She could not wait any longer, replied the child;
but
said
she
would call again to-morrow
Was ever any thing
so
unfortunate!
said
Lady
Chatterton.
George bit his lips, took
hasty
strides
backward and
forward in the room, frequently
struck
his forehead with
his hand, but
said
not a word.
In the afternoon the following letter was brought to
Lady Chatterton:
Madam
,
Agreeable to your
Ladyship
's benevolent
desire
, I
this morning waited on you in St. Alban's-
street
, an
honor
which the extreme
illness
of my mother had
prevented
my enjoying
so
early as I could have
wished
. While
I was, in compliance with your commands, waiting your
Ladyship
's return from airing, I
discovered
that Lord
Chatterton and Sir George Worthy are one and the
same
person
; it therefore
struck
me that your
Ladyship
,
having
seen
his portrait in my
possession
, might entertain but
an indifferent opinion of my character: It might
also
occasion
uneasiness
between my Lord and you, and
interrupt
that felicity which I
servently
wish
may be as
permanent
and
lasting
as your lives. I thought it my
duty, therefore, to explain to your
Ladyship
the means
by which this portrait came into my
possession
.
I once, Madam, lived in the family of the late
Lady
Mary Worthy, more as an highly favoured
companion
than a
servant
. Indeed
she
was to me a generous
friend, a dear and
respected
benefactress
, whom living I
loved with the affection of a daughter, and whom dead
I can never
cease
to lament.
Some months after her death, I received her
portrait
as a
present
from Sir George, by the hands of Mrs.
Harley, her
Ladyship
's
house
-keeper, but did not know
it contained the
resemblance
of Sir George
himself
till
some
time after it had been in my
possession
; nor have
I
seen
him
since
, till about two months ago, when I
accidentally met him in the
street
, and even then we
scarcely
spoke
to each other.
Permit me, Madam, to return my thanks for the
unexpected bounty you
so
delicately
bestowed
upon me;
to thank you
also
for that benevolence of heart which
led you
so
far to
interest
yourself
in my behalf, as to with
again to
see
me; to have enjoyed your friendly protection
would have been a cordial to my
depressed
soul
; to
deserve
it, the
study
of my life: but, alas, Madam, an
insurmountable
obstacle
is placed between me and
so
enviable
a
distinction
. Since I was
so
happy as to meet you,
a
circumstance
has occurred, which will prevent my again
having the
pleasure
of waiting on you: But permit me
to offer up the
most
ardent prayers for the continued
happiness
of
yourself
and Lord. May peace and love ever
dwell in your
bosoms
, and
prosperity
crown your days.
Permit me
also
to add, that however
inconsistent
my
conduct
may appear, my heart will everflow with the
most
grateful affection towards your
Ladyship
, while it beats
in the
breast
of,
Madam,
Your obliged humble
servant
,
REBECCA LITTLETON.
P. S. I
must
entreat your
Ladyship
to inform my dear
Miss
Ossiter
, how much I was gratified by her
affectionate
remembrance of me, and that I
shall
ever pray for her
happiness
.
I can't comprehend all this,
said
Lady Chatterton,
giving the letter into George Littleton's hand. He ran
his eye
hastily
over the contents.
But I can,
said
he: I conceive it all; the dear
girl has never heard of the
discovery
of the real Sir George
Worthy. She imagines me to be your
husband
, and the
generosity
of her
soul
will not
suffer
her to throw
herself
in the way of a man who once
prosessed
to love her, and
whom, from the whole tenor of her conduct, I have
reason
to think
she
loves.
I would lay my life
she
is a good girl,
said
Lady
Chatterton; indeed her countenance appeared the
index
of a mind replete with innocence and purity. I will
instantly
order the carriage, and go to her; nor will I
return
without her.
Dear, generous Lady Chatterton,
said
George,
ringing the bell.
Where is the
person
who brought this letter?
said
the Lady.
It was brought by a porter, Madam, and he did not
stop
a moment.
The joy that had for a moment animated the features
of George
instantly
vanished
. He again caught up the
letter, but there was no
address
annexed to it.
Just
then his father entered, and they lamented
together
,
that now they were more than ever convinced of the
worth of Rebecca
she
had effectually
secluded
herself
from them.
Overwhelmed with poverty too,
said
George,
and attendant on a
sick
mother, who may, perhaps, be
perishing
for want, not only of medical
assistance
, but of
the comforts and
necessaries
on which
existence
depends
.
We will
use
every endeavour though to
discover
her retreat,
said
Lady Chatterton, wiping away the tears
that
stole
from her
expressive
eyes, and when we have
found her we will
chase
sorrow
from her heart, and unite
our endeavours to make her forget
she
had ever been
unhappy
.
CHAP. XXXVI.
LADY CHATTERTON'S BIRTH-DAY.
After
every probable method had been taken by
Mr. Littleton, George and Lady Chatterton, to
discover
our heroine's retreat, all proving equally
ineffectual
,
they were obliged to
rest
satisfied
that no
exertion
of theirs had been wanting; and
trust
to chance for a
discovery
, which their united efforts had been unable to
make. Old Mr. Littleton began to be tired of living on
shore
, and applied for employment; but as he annexed
to the
request
the condition of being promoted in the
service
,
he fonnd but little attention was paid to it, and he
only received repeated
promises
, that when opportunity
offered he
should
be remembered. He
spent
great part of
his time with the Chatterton family, and as the
summer
approached it was
proposed
, that both
himself
and George
should
accompany them to their country
seat
.
H 2
Lady Chatterton's birth-day was on the 7th of June,
and
she
made a point of always celebrating it before
she
left town, her
husband
regularly
presenting
her with two
hundred pounds to be expended on the
occasion
. Mr.
Clayton, his
Lordship
's chaplain, being caterer
extraordinary
,
always provided the entertainment, in which her
Ladyship
was
so
very
selfish
, as to allow no one to partake
but her
husband
, this identical chaplain, and
herself
.
Mr. Clayton was always extremely
busy
for
some
weeks previous to the day, the whole cities of London,
Westminster
, and their environs, being
ransacked
for
delicacies
to
suit
her
Ladyship
's
taste
; for on this day
she
was a real voluptuary, though all the
rest
of her life was
marked by temperance and moderation: But to
speak
without a metaphor, Lady Chatterton was a woman of
so
unfashionable
a turn, that, rather than
raise
the envy
of half the town, by giving a
splendid
ball,
she
chose
to
expend the money her
husband
gave her in relieving
indigence
,
and
raising
depressed
merit.
There
shall
be
some
cause
for rejoicing on my
birth-day
,
said
she
, for I will cheer the afflicted
spirit
, and
fulfil the duties incumbent on my
station
; we were
created
to be of
service
to each other, and we have no
reason
to rejoice in our creation but as we fulfil the
design
of him who gave us being.
Mr. Clayton, therefore, carefully
searched
for objects
proper to excite her
Ladyship
's
compassion
, and
share
her benevolence. The happy
season
now drew near,
and Clayton took his
usal
walks round the metropolis,
while, with a laudable
curiosity
, he made little errands
into chandlers-
shops
, green-
stalls
, and public
houses
, in
order to learn the
circumstances
of the people in every
poor neighbourhood through which he
passed
. It
happened
,
as he was
purchasing
some
barly-
sugar
at a
shop
of the former
description
, he
saw
two
suspicious
looking
men
ascend
the
stairs
, and immediately after heard a
bustle
in the appartment over the
shop
.
Presently
the
men came down, accompanied by a genteel looking
man in deep mourning. He had the air and manner of
a gentleman; but his uncombed hair, and pale,
unshaven
face,
bespoke
a mind ill at
ease
.
Well, they have nabb'd him at
last
,
said
the
mistress
of the
shop
, as the young man and his ungenteel
companions left the
house
together.
Would you believe it, Sir, that young man, not
six
months ago, was one of the
gayest
bucks about town.
I remember him
flashing
away like a Lord, and I was
told he
visited
Lords and gentlefolks of great fortune.
Indeed, they did
say
, there was a Lady of quality in
love with him, but that was not much to his credit or
advantage, for
she
was a married woman, and once he
had liked to have got
himself
killed by her
husband
.
But if he was
so
gay,
said
Clayton, how came
he
so
reduced as he now appears?
Why, Sir, you
must
know I can give you good
information, for I once lived
servant
in the family,
though now, thank God, I can hold up my head
without
service
, or without being beholding to any body,
and that is more than every one can
say
.
Well, but about the young gentleman,
said
Clayton
,
rather impatiently.
Yes, as I was
saying
, he was a gay
spark
, and
Miss
, his
sister
, a very fine Lady. His father was a
merchant
,
and kept a large
house
in the city, and lived
away at a very high rate; coach,
servants
, every thing
like a Lord: Well, behold you, he died about
six
months ago, and left not a farthing behind him,
so
away went coach, fine
house
, furniture, plate and all,
to pay his debts, and Madam,
Miss
, and her brother,
forced to humble
themselves
,
so
they came to lodge
with me. The young man got a trifling place in
some
office, and that is all they have to live on, which, I
believe
,
in my
conscience
, is little enough, for they run
fine long bills with me.
Why, Sir, they owes me above three guineas now; but,
seeing
as how other people are taken
measures
to get
their own, I
shall
make bold to
ask
for mine. Charity
begins at home, is an old proverb, and a very good one;
don't you think
so
, Sir? If
so
be Mr. Savage can't pay
his taylor, mayhap, when the bill gets a little higher,
he might not be able to pay me.
True,
said
Clayton, coldly; but could you
briug me to a fight of Mrs. Savage, or her daughter?
Lord! not I; they are
so
proud, that if a body
offers
to
speak
or introduce a friend, they are upon
stilts
directly.
Well, but pray
step
up with a civil
message
from
me;
say
I
wish
to
speak
with them on particular
business
.
And who
must
I tell them you are, Sir?
My name is of no
consequence
; only
say
a
clergyman
.
The woman executed the
commission
, and,
soon
returning
,
desired
Mr. Clayton to walk up.
On entering a
small
ill-
furnished
apartment, he beheld
two charmingly
prepossessing
women, the
eldest
of whom
did not appear to be more than forty years old, and the
youngest
seventeen
; they were
dressed
in mourning, plain
but extremely becoming, and had much the air of women
of
fashion
.
He apologized for the
seeming
rudeness
of a
stranger
intruding
himself
into their apartments uninvited,
mentioned
that he had
seen
the
transaction
of the
arrest
, and
thought it might be in his power to alleviate, if not
entirely
remove, their
distresses
.
The mother's eyes overflowed at the mention of her
son
's
imprisonment
. Her daughter took her hand,
pressed
it to her lips, gave her a
consolatory
look; but the
starting
drops of
sympathy
that trembled in her eyes
forbade
her utterance.
Lady Chatterton will dry
those
tears,
said
Clayton
,
mentally, or I am deceived in her character.
What a pity
so
much
sweetness
should
droop under the
heavy hand of affliction!
Clayton was a young man
Miss
Savage a charming
woman.
He drew from them, in the
most
delicate manner, an
account of their various
embarrassments
in pecuniary
matters
,
said
he had known the late Mr. Savage, and once
received a great obligation at his hands, which he was
happy in having now the power to return,
requested
they
would
consider
him as their banker; for, my dear
Miss
,
said
he to the daughter, I owed your father a
considerable
sum
of money. He then
presented
them
with the whole contents of his
purse
, as he
said
, in part
of payment, and departed,
promising
to
see
them again
in a few days.
His
assertions
, in regard to having known Mr. Savage,
were not
strictly
true; but it was a pious fraud, by which
he prevailed on the
distressed
ladies to accept pecuniary
assistance
, and, he humbly
trusted
, the
design
would
sanctify
the act.
Two days from this was Lady Chatterton's birth-day.
Come, Clayton,
said
she
, when
she
had read the
memorandums over of that day's intended
route
, we
will pay the
first
visit
to your pretty Savage.
Clayton introduced her to the Ladies as a
person
courting
their
friendship
, and
desirous
of
serving
them. From
them
she
learned that young Savage, when
arrested
,
having
not the
least
hope of liberation, had
insisted
on being
immediately conveyed to
prison
.
Then we will go and find a key to open
those
tremendous
doors,
said
Lady Chatterton, and I think,
glancing her eyes over her memorandums, I have
some
other
business
to
transact
there. My dear Ladies, I
will
soon
send
this beloved
son
and brother to you, on
condition you all dine with me to-day at five o'clock.
She
presented
her card and departed, leaving the ladies
oppressed
with delightful
sensations
that could only be
expressed
by tears.
Lady Chatterton proceeded to the
prison
, and was
introduced
to young Savage, whom
she
immediately
congratulated
on his liberty, your
disagreeable
business
is
all
settled
, Sir,
said
she
, and I beg you will
hasten
home to your expecting mother and
sister
. Savage
gazed
with
astonishment
at Lady Chatterton, for habited as
she
was in a plain robe of white
muslin
, a bonnet and
a cloack of the
same
materials, and led by the hand of the
meek, benevolent looking Clayton, he knew not whether
to
consider
her as an inhabibant of this nether globe, or a
a
celestial
spirit
.
If what you
say
, Madam, cried he, be really
true, and I have no
reason
to doubt it, for your
countenance
is benevolence
itself
. Pardon my
seeming
ingratitude
,
but I could have
wished
the affair had not been
so
speedily
concluded.
Strange, indeed!
said
her
ladyship
: Do you not
wish
for liberty?
Most
ardently, Madam; but there is in this
habitation
of
misery
an object more
deserving
your charitable
notice, an object
so
pitiable,
so
very
interesting
to the
feelings of humanity, that I could, with
satisfaction
have
seen
the liberality extended in my behalf transferred to
her.
Thank heaven!
said
her
Ladyship
, neither the
means of comforting the afflicted, nor the will to
use
those
means, are denied me; neither my heart or
purse
are limitted. Come, Sir, lead on to the place where I
may dry the tear of
sorrow
, and gladden the
prisoner
's
ear by the welcome
sound
of liberty.
Savage led the way to a
miserable
room, where, on a
truss
of
straw
, for neither bed nor chair appeared in the
apartment, laid an old woman,
almost
worn to a
skeleton
,
whose
haggard looks and laboured breathing,
seemed
to portend approaching
dissolution
!On the
same
straw
,
supporting
the aged invalid's head in her lap,
sat
the
almost
shadowy
figure of a young creature, habited
in a white bead gown, her hair hanging negligently
over her face and
shoulders
, one hand held the burning
forehead of the apparently dying woman, the other hung
motionless
by her
side
.
Beside
them
stood
a pitcher of
water, and a
small
brown loaf.
Heaven
preserve
us,
said
lady Chatterton,
gasping
for breath, what a
scene
is here! The old woman
raised
her languid eyes at the
sound
of the voice, but
the young one remained in the
same
posture
, nor
seemed
to heed that any one approached.
Lady Chatterton drew near, took her hand, and, in
a voice
soft
as the
music
of the
spheres
, bid her be
comsorted
.
Come, cheer up, my poor girl,
said
she
, I
will do all I can to
serve
you.
She turned her head, looked
earnestly
at Lady
Chartterton
,
a
saint
glow
rushed
over her pale features, and as
quickly
disappeared
as
she
exclaimed:Oh! I know
you; you are an angel of benevolence, and
sainted
.
She was immediately carried into the air, and on
cutting
the lace of her
stays
, Lady Chatterton
discovered
a
small
shagreen
case
, hung pendant from her neck by a
riband. A
sudden
irresistable
impulse
led her to open it,
when the portraits of George Littleton and Lady
Mary
struck
her fight. She looked again on the young
woman
,
who was now
just
recovering, and
instantly
in her
reanimated countenance, recognized the features of
Rebecca
.
The debt, for which her mother had been thrown
into
prison
, was fifteen pounds, which was contracted with
the apothecary during her's and Rebecca's
illness
.
Lady
Chatterton
soon
contrived to have it
discharged
, and
poor Mrs. Serl being tenderly informed of her liberation,
was carefully placed in the carriage, her daughter on
one
side
, and her deliverer on the other, who
supported
her as the coach moved
slowly
toward St. Alban's-Street;
nor ever did conqueror, in his triumphal car, feel more
exulting
sensations
than did her
Ladyship
when
she
led
the grateful, trembling Rebecca into her own
house
,
saw
her mother laid in a comfortable bed, and heard
from a
physician
, that tender attention and peace of
mind, would be more efficacious towards her
restoration
than medicine. He
also
ordered Rebecca to be
immediately
put to bed, and take
some
wine and water,
with a few drops of laudanum in it, as the agitation of
her
spirits
, and
suddenchange
of fortune, had
occasioned
a
wildness
in her looks, and an incoherence in her
discourse
, that rather alarmed him. Lady Chatterton
saw
the
prescription
administered
, and then
descended
to meet her
guests
in the dining parlour, while the
exhausted
Rebecca
sunk
into a more peaceful
slumber
than
she
had enjoyed for many months.
CHAP. XXXVII.
AS IT SHOULD BE.
The
party
assembled
in the dining parlour were
Lord and Lady Chatterton, the Savages, Mr.
Clayton
,
George Littleton and his father.
It was a tender, difficult
task
to inform
these
affectionate
relations that Rebecca was found, yet it was a
task
her
Ladyship
's generous heart burned to execute. Gently
and by degrees
she
made the
interesting
discovery
; but
when George knew that his Rebecca was really in the
house
, it was
impossible
to prevent his flying to the
apartment
that contained her; Mr. Littleton followed. They
entered the chamber with cautious
step
. George
softly
drew
aside
the curtain. She was in a profound
sleep
.
He
stood
gazing with a look of joy, mingled with
tender
pity, on her altered countenance. Mr. Littleton
sunk
on a chair by the
bedside
. Oh! my poor
suffering
girl,
said
he, how thou art changed! His
head fell on the pillow
beside
her, and tears
rushed
down
his venerable countenance.
Rebecca moved, the
nurse
forced George from her
bed-
side
. She opened her eyes; the power of
recollection
seemed
for a while
suspended
. She looked wildly
round her.
Where is my mother?
said
she
: I will not be
taken from her. If
she
must
die in
prison
, I will die
with her. She
raised
herself
in bed, and
saw
her
uncle.
Rebecca!
said
he, in an accent of
tenderness
,
have you forgot me, my dear Rebecca.
Oh! no, my beloved uncle,
said
she
, her head
dropping on his
shoulder
. Oh! no. How long have
you been in England? Then
pausing
a moment:
But what have they done with my mother?
She is
safe
, my love; endeavour to recollect
yourself
:
do you not know
she
came with you to this
house
?
She is in bed in the next room.
Rebecca put her hand to her forehead: I am
striving
to think,
said
she
; but I cannot remember
where I am, how I came here.By degrees the
power
of recollection returned, and every
circumstance
recurred
to her memory:I am in the
house
of Lord
Chatterton,
said
she
. I could have preferred any
other.
But
suppose
, my dear girl, Lord Chatterton
should
not be the
person
you think him?
Suppose
he
should
be a man whom you have never
seen
?
Rebecca
listened
in
silence
, and her uncle, in the
most
cautious manner, informed her of his having found a
son
, and that
son
was the man
she
had imagined
married
to Lady Eleanor Harcourt.
The relation was wonderful. Rebecca could
scarcely
credit it, yet, if it was really true, if
she
was
still
beloved
by the man
whose
image was engraven on her
heart, and, indeed,
released
from the vow
she
had
so
solemnly
given her
deceased
benefactress
, the rapidity
with which
these
reflections
rushed
through her brain,
the violent emotions of her heart,
almost
overpowered
her weak frame. She breathed with difficulty, her
eyes grew dim, the attendant perceived the change,
and, giving her a few drops in
some
water, recalled her
fleeting
spirits
.
And where is this new
cousin
of mine?
said
she
,
with a faint
smile
, when
she
was a little recovered:
methinks I
should
like to
see
him.
George's heart palpitated violently. He drew near
the bed, dropped on one knee, and cried, Oh! my
Rebecca, behold me here!
A
smile
of ineffable
pleasure
beamed over the
countenance
of Rebecca while
she
extended her hand toward
her lover. He took it, and
pressed
it to his lips. The
ensuing
scene
can be
easily
imagined by the feeling
heart, and to
those
devoid of
sensibility
, the
description
would be
insipid
, we therefore
pass
it over in
silence
.
Peace being now
restored
to the
bosom
of Rebecca,
her health, her vivacity and bloom, rapidly returned,
her mother too, recovered a
sufficient
degree of health,
to enable her to participate in her daughter's
happiness
.
I
An early day was named for the union of George and
Rebecca, previous to which Lord Chatterton procured
the old lieutenant to be
superannuated
, and a
handsome
pension
was given him in return for his long and
faithful
services
; a lucrative
post
was
also
procured for
George, but he
requested
leave to transfer it to young
Savage.
Pardon me, my Lord,
said
he, but that young
gentleman has no means of
supporting
his amiable
mother
and
sister
. For my own part, though in the early
part of life
accustomed
to all the indulgencies of an
affluent
fortune, I have been long convinced, that
abundance
of riches cannot
secure
happiness
.
Possessed
of
my Rebecca,
whose
humble
spirit
will enjoy
most
felicity
in the quiet,
undisturbed
walks of life, beholding
my father
possessed
of
sufficient
to make his
setting
sun
serene
and unclouded, what can I
desire
more? We will
retire into
Berkshire
, to the
estate
you
so
generously
settled
on my family, and if we can once a year
boast
of
the honour of a
visit
from you and your amiable Lady,
I
shall
be the
happiest
mortal breathing. His
Lordship
was
pleased
with George's
frankness
, and the place
was given to Savage, who was equally capable of
discharging
the duties incumbent upon him with honour
and integrity.
Lady Chatterton had, with her Lord's approbation,
ordered a
settlement
to be made on Rebecca of two
thousand
pounds, which
sum
his
Lordship
supplied
and
placed in the funds for her own particular
use
.
The day after the union took place, Rebecca,
George, Mr. Littleton, and Mrs. Serl, took an
affectionate
leave of their generous friends in St.
Alban'sstreet
,
and departed for
Berkshire
.The beauty of
the
situation
, the neat cottage-like appearance of the
house
, and beautiful
simplicity
of the furniture,
afforded
Rebecca the
most
pleasurable
sensations
. She was
soon
visited
by the neighbouring gentry, among whom,
what was her
surprise
to
see
, Lady Winterton,
whose
sable
habilments told
she
was emancipated from that
worst
of
slavery
, wedlock, with the man
she
could not
love.
She informed our heroine that her health was
so
impaired
by vexation, and the effects of the wound
she
had received, that her life was thought in imminent
danger. Change of air was
prescribed
, and her Lord
had brought her down to a
small
estate
of his in
Berkshire
;
that
she
had found benefit from the change, but
from the time of their leaving town, her Lord's health
had declined; he had been
subject
to an
asthmatic
complaint
,
which
increased
upon him, and had terminated
his life about two months before Rebecca's arrival in the
country.
Lady Winterton was too delicate in her
present
circumstances
to mention the name of Savage. She had
been imprudent, but never guilty.
Sickness
had
moderated
the extreme vivacity of her
disposition
, and taught
her to reflect. She could not avoid
wishing
to hear of
him, or learn the
reason
why, from the fatal evening
when they met at
Chiswick
, he had never attempted to
write to or
see
her. She was entirely ignorant of his
fate from that time, yet
she
kept
those
wishes
carefully
concealed.
Rebecca applauded her conduct, and
desired
her
husband
to mention, when next he wrote to Savage, that
Lady Winterton was their neighbour, and that
she
was
a widow. The effect this letter produced may be
easily
imagined. Savage flew into
Berkshire
on the wings of
love, and the fair widow
promised
, in due time, to give
him her hand.
Lord and Lady
Ossiter
continued on the Continent,
where,
immersed
in vice and
dissipation
, his
Lordship
fell a victim to intemperance, and her
Ladyship
became
notorious for her gallantry; forgetful of the
sacred
name of mother,
she
gave the reins to folly, and
publicly
defied the laws of virtue and honour.
Though Rebecca, from the variegated
scenes
through
which
she
had
passed
, had
purchased
a thorough
knowledge
of the world, yet had it not hardened her heart,
or rendered her callous to the calls of
misery
, her
prudence
in her family concerns enabled her ever to have a
morsel
for the hungry, and a garment to throw over the
destitute
orphan. When the poor
saw
her they
blessed
herinfant lips
set
forth her
praises
and aged knees
bent for her before the Throne of Grace. She cheered
the declining years of her mother and uncle. They
called down
blessings
on her head.
Her
husband
adored her. Her
servants
loved and
reverenced
her. Her
bosom
was the
seat
of unfeigned
piety
.
The
smile
of content dimpled on her cheek, and
her dwelling was the
mansion
of peace.
FINIS.
