CHAPTER I.
THE GAZELLE KEEPER.
`So shone the sun upon the arrowy
Guadalquivir, when Spain was ruled by
a Christian, and the Cross of God rose
where now the Moslem Crescent gleams!'
These words were slowly and sadly
spoken by a venerable, apostolic-looking
man with a lofty and towering form, a
pale, thoughtful brow, and features of the
most noble outline. He wore a garment
of close cloth, girded by a thong of
untanned
leather about his waist, and descending to his feet, which were
sandalled
with untanned hide, strapped with
cords across his naked feet. To his
brown-hued coarse robe was attached a
hood, which hung down his shoulders,
leaving exposed his fine silvery head and
commanding brow. His beard like a
cataract of shining snow, descended into
his bosom and was lost there. His eye
was as clear as light and as gentle as
that of a maiden's, white his pure
complexion
was as soft as an infant's, the
effect
of rigid abstinence from animal
aliment
,
and of many a long fast and
wasting
vigil.
There was a lustre and transparency
to his countenance that seemed to belong
more to heaven than to earthan
ethereal
,
saint-like expression that gave it an
aspect almost divine.
The words he had uttered fell
unexpectedly
and startlingly upon the car of
a young man seated at his feet upon a
rock, which, being near the Sierra
Morena
,
commanded a wide and
magnificent
prospect of the green vale of the
Guadalquivir, and the silver white towers
and dark walls of Cordova upon its
banks.
He was a young shepherd of tha
Sierras
by his garb, which was a
baregan
of dark cloth fastened at his neck by a
loop of leather, bound with a girdle of
goat's hide, and terminating at the knee,
which, with half the leg, were encased
in coarse mountain boots of dried skin.
By his side was a rudely-made hat of
palm leaves, with the brim thriee the
breadth of the crown, and also a strong
oak pike, seven feet long, terminating in
a hook, not unlike a shepherd's crook.
His age was not more than three or
four and twenty at the most; yet the
mountain life he had led matured a
nobly
developed form, which was moulded
as if it had been the original for the
Greek Apollo. Though his cheek was
as brown as the chesnut of his native
Sierras
,
his face was remarkably handsome
and lighted by an eye at once soft as the
gazelles and piercing as that of the
mountain
eagle.
He was reclining at his ease upon a
rock, which stood upon the very pinnacle
and outer verge of a cliff that towered a
thousand feet from the valley in a sheer
precipice. He had been collecting his
goats and gazelles, of which he had a
flock numbering more than one hundred,
and having gathered them from the nooks
and shelves and peaks of the mountain,
whither they had dispersed themselves
seeking the scanty herbage of the heights,
be gaided them into the rocky pathway
which led down the mountain side home
ward, and here turned aside, as he was
wont to linger and gaze upon the fair
valley, lighted up with the splendor of
the setting sun.
And a fair and glorious sun it was that
made the goat-herd loiter on his
homeward
path till often the shadows of night
would hasten upon him and render his
passage down the steep footway perilous
even to his practised tread. Beauteous
as the Vale of Paradise itself, the verdant
plain of the golden Guadalquivir lay
before
his admiring and wistful eyes.
Terminating
on the south at the majestic
wall of the dazzling Sierra Nevada,
whose purple sides were finely blended
with their snowy crests, and embraced in
the north by the encircling arms of the
Morena Mountains, with the beautiful
river meandering through its green
bosom
,
its banks studded with cities and
towers, and lovely with groves and
gardens
,
it seemed truly to be, as it was
termed by the Moors, `the guarded
emerald
of the earth.'
In the midst of the charming valley sat
Cordova, upon a throne of towers, the
Queen of all the fair scene. Upon her
hundred minarets sparkled the crescent
of Islam, and from the bosom of her
groves rose side by side with the
cathedral
of the Nazarene, the Mosque of Omar.
A league from the base of the
mountain
,
along a winding road, a party of
travelling merchants, with their long train
of laden mules and horses was visible,
making its way from a pass in the hills
towards the city, ere the gates should be
closed for the night; and off the road,
beneath a grove of stately palms, that
flung their delicate shadows far across
the green plain, were assembled a
caravan
of Moorish travellers, with one or
two camels and many horses and mules,
some laden, others garnished with gay
trappings, while here and there moving
about the picturesque encampment, were
seen cavaliers in turbans and embroidered
vests. The eminences along the face of
the Sierras, were frowning with castle
and tower, many of them in ruins, yet
all adding to the effect of the picture
spread before the eyes of the young
mountaineer.
He had reclined at first upon the
rock, and gazed with a subdued look of
enjoyment; but gradually his eyes
lighted
up, and an expression of decision,
not untinged with melancholy, passed
across his handsome face.
It was at this moment, that the words
spoken by the hermit fell upon his ear.
Upon hearing his voice he started
quickly
to his feet, and turned towards the
speaker and knelt with an air of
reverence
upon his knee, while he said
earnestly,
`Thy blessing, father.'
`Thou hast it, son!' responded the
hermit, laying his hand upon his head.
The young man kissed the hand with
affectionate veneration, and then
standing
up said
`You are far from your cell, father,
for this hour. It will be night ere you
reach it, and the way is perilous to one
of thy years! Let me guide thee, father.'
`Stay, not yet, son. I will sit here
and rest with thee. This stone is a
sacred seat. 'Tis said the Holy Paul
when he first preached in Spain the
cross of the Crucified, was five days
wandering among these mountains, to
which he had been driven by those in
Cordova, who would not hear his
doctrine
.
He was secreted here by a
converted
Israelite, and from this rock gazed
upon Cordova as we do now.'
`How knowest thou this, father?'
asked
the young mountaineer, reverently,
stepping aside from the spot, and gazing
with holy awe upon the little recess in
which he had been reclining.
`Tradition, son, which never suffers
ought to perish touching the followers of
the Messiah.' `And tradition, father,
says that Paul from this rock shook off
from his feet the dust of the city, and
said, prophetically, `Thou hast rejected
the Cross; therefore thou shalt wear the
yoke.'
`And that yoke, father?'
`Is the crescentand a grievous yoke
has it been this twenty years to Cordova.
The rule of the Moslem is a punishment
of Heaven upon the land that proved
itself
unworthy to bear the foot of an
apostle
.
Yes, my son, in the rule of the
Moor we behold the retribution which
was denounced upon yonder city. As
now it shines in the setting sun, fair and
glorious to the eye it shone twenty years
ago the pride of a Christian King, and
Christian people. But then the sun
lighted
up no infidel crescent. A thousand
crosses flung back his beams. Look! can
thy young glance espy even one lowly
symbol of Christ in all this vale of beauty?
`The crescent is everywhere, father.
I see no cross.'
`No. Not one is left standing. The
sign of the False Prophet usurps even
upon the Temples of God, the place of
the Son of Man. The church is
desecrated
into a mosque; and the
muezzin
calls
the prayer from the tower in which once
chimed the vesper and matin-bell. It is a
sad sight, my son, for the eyes of a
Christian
man to gaze upon. But prayer and
faith will yet avail to turn aside the
judgment
that is upon us. Penitence and
deep humiliation among the great and the
rich, aye among the priests of the altar,
are needful. This has come upon us for
the worldliness of the church, the
licentiousness
of the priesthood. God has
bridged
the sea to the infidel, and given the
fair lands into his hand to waste and to
pollute. Let me lean on thy shoulder,
my son, I will accept thy guidance.
`Willingly, holy hermit,' answered
the young man as he placed the hand of
the venerable recluse upon his shoulder
and turned to support him up the
mountain
to his cell, which was situated at
least four hundred feet higher than the
lofty projection on which they were
standing
.
`Not this way, my son. I go down
into the valley,' he said, pointing down
the steep path, that was lost to the eye,
a thousand feet below in a ravine, in the
shadows of which lay half-buried a
shepherd's
hamlet.
`Then you have just come down from
the summit, father?'
`Yes; I have an errand of mercy
below
to-night.'
`It is not often you are found out of
your cell, father, when the evening star
rises over the peak;' said the young man,
as he directed his steps away from the
cliff-verge and began to descend a
precipitous
goat-track, that wound down the
western side of the Sierra. Slowly they
descended together, that youth and aged
man, the younger supporting the elder
with tenderness, mingled with reverence.
The sun sank into a bed of purple
clouds, and the soft shadows of
advancing
twilight began to fall over the
beautiful
scenes of the valley. The city with
its towers and walls, and arching domes,
melted into a golden haze, that each
instant
grew browner and more obscure,
till the minarets of the mosque could no
longer be distinguished from the tall shafts
of the palm-tree that towered about them.
The river soon caught the light of the first
star, and shortly after the moon, like the
half of a large pearl, rose over the Sierra
and flung its chaste radiance over grove
and river, and softly beaming upon the
crescents which the sun had so lately
left.
Steadily, and firmly, and with the
affection
of a son, the young mountaincer
guided the steps of the noble hermit amid
the gathering darkness and gloom of the
way; and ceming at length to a small
ledge, which projected about a hundred
feet above the hamlet, in the ravine
beneath
,
they paused there to rest.
`Thanks, my son. Thy arm is as
strong as it is willing. It is not often
that I need other aid, even in this
mountain
path, than my own strength. But
I have not been well of late!
`Thou dost fast too often, I fear
father
!'
`Nay, it is grief rather than abstinenee
that hath weakened me.'
`And how much farther than the
hamlet
do you intend to go, father; for I
will accompany thee?'
`Not far; but I need no aid when I
reach the plain. But who comes this
way down the glen? A hunter, and by
his garb a Moor.'
The place where they stood was a
shelf in a winding path, that led from
a mountain pass to the summit of one
of the boldest of the Sierras. In the
defile itself at the foot of the path was
nestled a hamlet of a dozen humble
herdsmen's
huts, perched here and there
upon
the rocky banks of a wild torrent.
About one hundred feet above the
torrent
,
and level with the spot on which
they were resting, ran a path through
the defile, and so to the summit of the
mountain to the rear. Both of these
paths that led through the defile, and that
descending from the cliff by which they
had terminated on this natural platform,
and joining, formed a single path down
to the hamlet.
Along this defile way a person was
advancing alone, a green silken turban
upon his head, and a rich, scarlet
Moorish
shawl bound round his waist by a
morocco belt, to which hung his curved
scymeter. His figure was strikingly
elegant
and commanding. His costume
sparkled with silver and jewels. He was
slenderly built, had a fine expressive
black eye, and handsome features. But
his face was now flushed, and his
bearing
highly excited. He wore a dark
mustache. On seeing the two strangers
he assumed a hostile and haughty air,
and with the fragment of a short hunting
spear which he carried, and upon which
he slightly leaned as he walked, he
menaced
them.
`Stand back, dogs of Christians!' he
cried haughtily.
`Hear that my son!' said the old
hermit
,
with a flashing eye.
`I hear it father,' answered the
mountaineer
,
clenching his hand impulsively;
`but we must submit! I would gladly
lay down my poor life that such words
might no more be heard on the air of
Spain. The time may come father!
These Moors be but
men!
'
`They called my master Beelzebub.
His followers must not be startled to be
called dogs!'
`Pass, Moor!' said the young man in
a tone of stern defiance.
CHAPTER II.
THE YOUTHFUL MOOR.
The
youthful Infidel, for he had not
seen more than twenty summers, strode
on with his broken spear advanced, as if
he anticipated an attack from the
mountaineer
;
for in those hostile times every
man was likely to meet a foe in every
stranger whose path he crossed. He
came along the path until he stood before
them. The platform of rock was so
narrow
,
that the hermit and the
gazelle-tender
fully occupied it; yet the descent of
the path lay over it, to which it formed a
sort of step. The hermit stood firm; but
the mountaineer by his side gave way as
far as he might with safety, to let the
young Moorish huntsman pass between
them.
He hesitated, nevertheless, to go by.
The stern glance of thu hermit rested upon
him as he remained as immovable as a
statue.
`Wilt thou let me pass, Christian
dog?' repeated the Moor with flashing
eyes, as he pressed his spear point
towards
the silvery beard of the venerable
apostle of the Cross.
`The Christian hath turned aside full
often for the Infidel, young man.'
`I cannot pass unless thou move also,'
answered the Moor. `I am wounded by
the tusk of a boar which I slew but a few
paces up the defile, and I hasten to my
friends. Let me pass.'
`There is fresh blood discoloring his
kaftan, father,' said the mountaineer.
`He speaks the truth.'
`I am deeply hurt in the side. Give
way and let me hasten, or thou shalt rue
it. My life or thine.'
`Nay, if thou art in suffering I will not
stay thee, but rather aid thee, Infidel,'
answered the hermit, his brow relaxing
its sternness of aspect, and his
countenance
beaming with benevolence and
sympathy. Sit here and let me see thy
wound and I will bind it up for thee.'
The young man gazed keenly upon
his features with looks of mingled doubt
and confidence. The latter feeling
prevailed
,
perhaps aided by his
consciousness
of his inability to advance forward
without some aid; for he was growing
fainter each moment from the loss of
blood which was now seen trickling upon
his sandalled feet.
`I will trust thee, Christian,' he
answered
faintly, as he sat, or rather sank
down upon the rock at their feet; his
spear fell from his relaxed grasp; a
deadly paleness took the place of the
flushed brow; and, inclining his head
upon his shoulder, he became insensible
in the arms of the young gazelle-keeper.
`He has now beceme a subject for
Christian love and pity, rather than
Christian anger,' said the recluse. Poor
youth, though an Infidel, he is a child of
Adam, even as we are, and we cannot
refuse him our aid in extremity. Loosen
the shawl, Alfonzo. Carefully, for the
wound may be deep, and the blood should
not come too freely.'
The young mountaineer had stood
aside, as we have seen, at the imperious
and insulting demand of the Moor, to
give him room to pass; for, though he
loved not the Infidel, he regarded him
as it were a guest upon his mountains,
and he did not care to be so uncharitable
as to deny him the pathway, open to all.
He had stood aside, too, at imminent
peril, for the rock below him fell sheer
a hundred feet, and he had only his
firmness of foot and steadiness of nerve
to sustain him while the Moor should pass
him. In stepping aside, therefore, he
trusted to the Moor's honor not to jostle
him; for the slightest touch would have
sent him headlong. In a word, he had
jeopardised his own life out of a spirit of
mountain courtesy to the Infidel. It was
not a feeling of fear that caused him to
obey. The heart of the young
gazelle-tender
knew nothing of the sensation
before
man.
The stern Christian indignation of the
bearded hermit, however, would not
suffer him to yield to a demand made so
haughtily and with such epithets. He
stood his ground, and would have
grappled
with the Moor ere he would have
recognized the degrading appellation
applied
to him by obeying. But when he
saw the young Moslem bleeding before
him, and beheld him sink insensible at
his feet, all his humanity dissolved into
gentle charity for the sufferer; and,
forgetting
the Mahommedan in the man, he
extended to him prompt assistance.
From his girdle he untied a thick
leather
pouch, which he hastily opened, and
out of it took two little crystal vials
and a box of some fragrant unction,
which he proceeded to mingle together
and pour upon linen torn from the
bosom
of the Moor. By the time he had
prepared this, Alfonzo had removed the
shawl and firmly woven garments and
laid bare the wound, which was an
unsightly
rent in the side between the ribs.
In a few moments, by the application of
the linen saturated with the medical
preperation
the flow of the blood ceased.
The wound was then carefully dressed
and bound up by the hermit with a
degree
of skill found at this time only in
the art of the surgoon.
`Now, my son, canst thou bear him
on thy shoulders to thy hut in the
hamlet
!'
asked the hermit as he completed
his Samaritan-like task. `We have done
our duty to this Infidel, as unto God, and
we must not let him lie here and die.
We must watch over him till he can
take his feet again!'
`I can carry him, father!' answered
Alfonzo as he raised the lifeless form of
the stranger upon his shoulder and
proceeded
carefully to descend the steep
way, the hermit following supporting his
steps by the aid of the boar-spear which
he had brought from the shelf of rock
to return to the Moor when he should
recover.
In a few minutes, this latter portion of
the mountain path being easier of descent
than the former, they reached the foot
of the mountain and entered all at once
upon a kind of village thoroughfare
that led beneath shady trees, along the
rocky borders of the brook and lined on
one side with the rude huts of the
mountains
.
Although this hamlet seemed to be,
when viewed from Paul's Rock, in the
level of the valley, it was at least
seventy
feet above it, and the brook of the
defile
along which it was built, gained the
vale only by a succession of wild
cataracts
,
whose roar echoing from the cliff
and mountain sides, was heard
unceasingly
.
It was a rude, romantic spot where the
hamlet stood, and being so high on the
road of the valley and so profoundly
concealed by trees that it was visible
only
to those who from the cliff above
could look directly down on its thatched
roofs and hugely constructed chimneys.
Alfonzo bore the burden on his
shoulder
along the street of the hamlet, until
he came to a hut constructed of stone a
little apart from the rest of the
habitations
.
It was sheltered by half a dozen
date and banana trees, and a majestic
cork tree grew before its door. Under
the cork-tree sat a man about forty years
of age making a frugal meal of coarse
barley bread and dried fish. He wore
the dark brown shepherd's
rernagan
and
broad palm hat, and at his feet crouched
a shaggy wolf dog, who upon seeing the
approach of Alfonzo and the recluse,
glared hls white teeth and emitted a
savage
growl.
`Who is it, Lopo?' questioned the man
as he looked through the dim twilight in
the direction of the approaching party.
`Ah, it is the good father, Godefred, and
Por Dios! here comes Alfonzo with a
dead man on his shoulder!'
With these words the goatherd laid his
bread and fish down on the root of the
tree upon which he had been seated, and
hastened to meet them.
`What is this? Who have you here?
An Infidel? We have one less enemy
in the land.'
`He is not dead father Gaspar,'
answered
Alfonzo, as he laid his burden at
the foot of the tree.
`Not dead! Then by the mass let us
kill him ere he get to his feet again!'
cried the goat herd drawing from his
girdle the broad sharp knife that he had
used in many a combat with the wolves
of the Sierras in defence of his goats.
`Nay, Gaspar,' cried father Godfrey,
arresting his hand as he aimed a blow at
the breast of the lifeless Moor with as
little compunction as if the infidel had
been a wild beast. `The Moslem is thy
guest? You must not harm him. God
hath given him to our charity, and we
must not show ourselves worse than
barbarians
by slaying a helpless foe. We
found him on the hill at the cross path,
he was grievously wounded in combat
with a boar and sank at our feet lifeless;
albeit if he had had strength he would not
have hesitated to have made his way
over our bodies. But when he could no
longer do us harm and lay at our feet
dying, christian feeling commanded us to
bind up his wounds and restore him to
life.'
`To kill thee afterwards,' growled
the dark-faced goatherd slowly and
reluctantly
returning his knife to its sheath
of untanned leather.
`Nay, he will never injure a
benefactor
,
Infidel though he be. The sons of
Islam regard hospitality as a sacred duty.
So must we Christians. How know you
but that we may convert him to the
faith of the cross when he shall recover?
Hast thou a spare couch?
`He shall have mine, father!'
answered
Alfonzo.
`That is noble in thee, son. I am
glad to see that thy soul is so superior as
to not only disdain taking advantage of a
fallen foe, but to put thyseif to
iuconvenience
to entertain him. Gaspar, I see
discontent on thy brow still. Thou may'st
go into the valley and slay as many
Moors as thou wilt, but thou canst not
lay thy hand upon the man whom God
hath smitten, without sin. Alfonzo bear
him into the hut and let him sleep. As
he awakes give him this potion dissolved
in a glass of water from the brook. It
will restore his strength, and at the end of
three days he will be able to rejoin his
friends in Cordova for by his white hands
and his rich costume he is of high lineage
among the Moslems.'
`And whither go you, father?' asked
Gaspar. `By the mass, I shall not sleep
a wink to night with a Mahmoud under
my roof. Make the sign of the cross on
my door-stone ere thou depart.'
`I am glad to see thy faith in the
cross my son. It will protect thee and
all who believe in it, both in this world
and the next, and against infidel and
Satan
.
I will do as thou sayest.'
With these words the venerable
apostle
knelt upon the threshold after Alfonzo
had again lifted the body and bore in into
the hut, and reverently made the sign of
the cross not only upon the door-stone,
but also upon the lintel and sides of the
door. The mind of Gaspar seemed from
his countenance to be greatly relieved by
this strong defence against Moorish
necromancy
;
should their guest attempt to
exercise any of the supernatural evil
power attributed to the Saracen. Father
Godfrey now approached the rude couch
of dried mountain grass, upon which
Alfonzo
had gently laid the Moor, and by
the pleasing light of a torch of resin-wood
gazed for a moment upon his pale and
strikingly beautiful features.
`Poor youth; with so fair a body, and
so dark a soul: alas, that it should be lost
forever, when Christ hath died for him as
well as for thee and me, Gaspar. When
I return to the hamlet, which I shall do
to-morrow morning early, I will call and
see how he fares. If he wake up before
dawn, Alfonzo, speak to him kindly; and
let him not rise till I come. Now good
night, and God's benison be on thee and
thy house.
Father, I will go with thee,' said
Alfonzo
,
following him out of the hut, and
laying his grasp upon his robe.
`No, son; I need no aid now. The
way is familiar to my feet and my staff,
by night as well as by day. Watch you
by the side of the infidel. Thy conduct
this night has made me love thee,
Alfonzo
.
I have often looked upon thee with
interest as I have seen thee watching thy
gazelles upon the cliffs, and thanked the
blessed Virgin that thou wert a son of
the church. Thou hast shown true
Christian
charity to-night. I know thy hatred
of the Moslem power, my son, and thy
scorn of the infidel name; and, know
therefore, that to extend this kindness to
one of the foes of thy church and land,
was a great sacrifice of thy fiery spirit.
Good night, son. I go on a mission that
requires secrecy and needs no
companionship
,
else I would take thee with me.
Watch well over thy guest.'
With these words the hermit walked
forward, and soon Alfonzo saw his white
locks disappear over the verge of the
path that led down into the valley.
Slowly
he returned to his hut, and entering it
approached the Moor, who seemed to
sleep heavily, and seating himself by his
couch, began to examine with a curious
eye the jewels with which he was
adorned
.
CHAPTER III.
THE SPANISH TOWER.
While Alfonzo was admiring the
richness
of the apparel, and the wondrous
beauty of the jewels which adorned the
wounded Infidel, Gaspar, his father, sat
on the opposite couch gazing moodily
and silently upon the pale face of their
unconscious guest. At length he spoke,
as he saw Alfonzo examine with
attention
a jeweled bracelet that clasped the
left wrist of the Infidel:
`This tinsel
we
have to pay for, boy.
That red ruby is made of the best blood
of Spain. That diamond is made of the
congealed tears of the daughters of the
land who fill the Infidel's bosom. These
silken vestments are woven from the
heart's fibres of the best men in Spain.
What the man has on is not his, but thine
and mine.
This was said sternly, and with a
countenance
darkly foreboding the purpose
that the goatherd was forming in his
soul. Alfonzo fixed upon him a keen
glance. He read his father's thoughts
and feelings, for his own bosom
sympathized
in them. He felt that his words
were true words; that the glory of the
Moslem was the degradation of Spain.
But he could not enter into his father's
stern resolve to desecrate the hospitality
of the roof beneath which, in his arms,
he had brought the youthful Saracen, at
the command of the holy hermit.
`Father, you say what no man in
Spain can gainsay. But this is no time
to talk of such things. This Infidel and
all he possesses is sacred.
`Alfonzo, I am a poor goatherd. I live
on coarse fare, I wear coarse garments;
and this poor cabin is my only home.
But before the Moor came my father was
a noble, of proud Gothic and Roman
lineage
.
He fared sumptuously, he wore
purple and dwelt in a palace. All this
before the Moor came. I am made poor
through the Infidel. My father's palace
in Cordova is now the Seraglio of a
turbaned
Emir. My father's head fell
beneath
the scymetar of the conqueror
Taric. I alone live an exile in the Sierras,
remembering the past greatness and
present
ignominy of my house and name.
And this man who lies here, and his, did
it.'
`He is not twenty yet, father, and it is
twenty years since Taric at the battle of
Xeres overthrew the Christian power and
made Cordova the Saracen capital. At
least
this
young man is innocent.'
`Art thou a Moor, that thou should'st
speak one word in behalf of one of them?'
cried Gaspar, with angry vehemence.
`If he was not one of the conquerors of
the land he is one of its dwellers and one
of our masters. At this moment thou
seest that he has upon his person wealth
for a noble. It is not his. The Moors
brought nothing into Spain but their
scymetars. Yet they have cities and
morgues, and slaves, and gold and silver,
and wear silks and jewels, and the
Moslem
court of Cordova outvies in regal
splendour the court of the Gaul or the
Roman Emperor! All this magnificence
hath been coined out of Spanish hearts.
I say this Moor's jewels are mine. I
will tear them from him, boy, and send
him forth to get more as he got these,
by robbing and rapine. I will be a
goat-herd
no longer and crouch here in fear
to show my head in the valley for fear
of a Saracen scymetar. I will go to
Vence or Rome and live their like a
noble
as my fathers were.'
`The good father Godfrey hath given
him to me and thee in sacred charge. I
would not touch a hair of his head. Nor,
father, shall you so wrong yourself as to
harm him!'
`Dost thou menace me?' cried Gaspar,
laying his hand upon the haft of his knife.
`No, father. But I would not have
it said in the hamlet by our neighbours
that the hermit Godfrey brought a
wounded
Moor to thy roof and bade thee take
charge of him till he got well, and that
thou did'st basely rob him. The honest
goatherds would cry `shame!'
`With this Moor's gold and jewels I
should ere many days be beyond the
voices of my neighbours and indifferent
to their scorn. Say no more, boy; I will
take his jewels from him ere he wakes to
defend them.'
`Yes, father, that is right. Go to it
like a coward, as becomes the deed you
would do. Be careful that he wakes not
to scare thee away. I did not believe
the best of gold would have made thee
forget thy honesty as a man, and thy
honour as a Spaniard, to say nothing of
thy duty as a host.'
`Do you mock me? I swear to thee,
boy, that I will not let this Moor go forth
as rich as he came. It is a merit to rob
an infidel. It is not robbery, but taking
back that which is our own.'
`Hear me, father,' said Alfonzo, who
saw him stretch forth his hand rudely to
unclasp the dazzling bracelet from his
arm. `You are a brave man. You have
slain in deadliest struggle three score and
ten wolves, as the notches on thy
boar-spear
show to all who will count them.
Now wouldst thou by one act of robbery,
the robbery of a wounded and sleeping
foe, undo all thou hast done, and proclaim
thyself a coward.'
`I am no coward, boy.'
`Then show it by waiting till the
Infidel
is restored by father Godfrey's
potions
to strength and health. Then,
ere he departs, tell him what thou wert
tempted to do while he lay asleep in thy
power, and say that you will now give
him a chance to defend his property, for
you mean to try and win it of him in fair
battle as becomes a brave man.'
`I will do it; by the mass. I will
wait, boy,' responded the stout goatherd,
drawing back his hand from the tempting
bracelet. I would rather have them that
way, than meanly to rob him. Thank
thee, boy, for this hint. His jewels are
mine as certainly as if I took them now;
for he must needs he a strong man who
can defeat Gaspar, the wolf-killer.'
And as he thus spoke he elevated his
broad, herculean chest and gazed with
complacency upon his sinewy bare arms
as he moved them up and down with
athletic pride in their muscular power.
Alfonzo looked gratified that he had
succeeded by his knowledge of his
father's
character, in saving the sleeping
Moor from being plundered in their hut.
There was in the spirit of Alfonzo a vein
of chivalric feeling that elevated him far
above his condition; and though he loved
not the tyrant and oppressor of the land,
he could be generous and superior to
hostility or revenge in circumstances
which appealed like the present, to the
loftier sentiments of his breast.
It was with pleasure he saw the change
in the manner of Gaspar, who putting up
his formidable knife, looked once more
upon his guest, not with plans of robbery,
but with impatient wishes for his speedy
recovery. Alfonzo saw that the Moor
had nothing more to fear at present from
his father, and rising, he said,
`I will be in by and by and watch
with him, till dawn. I leave you, father,
to sit up with him till I come back.'
`I will do it. You need not fear me,
Alfonzo. I am as sure of him when he
gets well, as I should be now. Where
do you go?'
`Not far. I will be back in two hours.
If he wakes, administer what I have
mixed
in the cup!'
`I will do just as you say. I hope it
is a magic drink that will put him on his
feet in five minutes after as well as ever.
By the mass it would not be many
seconds before we should be at it,
Christian
to Moor.'
Alfonzo threw on his
bernish
, a coarse
brown mantle, like a blanket, about his
manly form, and gathering it about his
waist with a wide belt, to which hung a
wolf's sheathe knife, took his mountain
staff and went out.
The night was gloriously bright, with
burning stars in the deep azure of heaven,
rivaling the lustre of the pure moon,
which floated like a transparent shell
upon a blue sea. The low winds
breathed
gently among the lime and the date
trees, and rustled pleasantly in the
pendant
foliage of the banana. The
mountain
crests rose skyward on either hand,
as if supporting a group of the
fleece-like
clouds that hung above them and
almost seemed reposing upon them.
The roar of the sparkling brook at his
feet filled the defile with a constant song
that the mountains loved always to hear.
The young gazelle-tender walked along
the narrow road that led past the few huts
that composed the secluded hamlet, and
coming to the descent along the side of
the water-falls, bounded down the
declivity
almost with the speed of the
leaping
cataracts that shone in the
moonbeams
like ribbons of silver unrolled
down the dark face of tho cliff.
He was now upon the plain in a grove
of cork-trees whose heavy shadows left
the path-way which wound beneath their
huge trunks, in impenetrable darkness.
But, at intervals, glimpses of moonlight
falling upon the sward through an open
space between the branches, lighted him
along like beacons gleaming in the deep
forest gloom. He pursued his way, not
in the direction of the city of Cordova,
but following the base of the Sierra,
which constantly frowned above his path.
At length, after going about a mile, he
came suddenly upon a spur of the
mountain
,
and passing round it, he entered a
gorge similar to that in which the hamlet
stood. He ascended a few rods a grassy
but steep path, when getting above the
top of the forest trees which he had
hitherto been traversing, and which spread
before him like a dark green lake slightly
agitated by the breeze, he looked up and
rested his eyes for an instant upon a
tower a few feet above him and
overhanging
the path. It was a square
bastion
,
with a round turret or tower at the
outer angle, and standing on the very
verge of the mountain, and at the edge
of the defile, like a sentry to protect its
passes.
It was, however, in ruins, like nearly
every strong hold which had once
belonged
to the Christian inhabitants of the fair
valley of Andalusia; for that it was a
Spanish, and not a Moorish fortress, was
plain from its age and peculiar
construction
.
The tower had lost a portion of
its battlement, and the bastion had been
deprived of several feet of its wall at the
southern angle. Over it towered two
lofty sycamores, like protecting genii.
The moonlight fell upon it and exposed
both its strength and state of ruin.
`So has the curse of the infidel
blighted
all that is fair in Spain,' said Alfonzo,
as he let his eyes linger upon it as it
towered
over the forest, and looked yet like
a strong hold of power even in its
impotency
.
All about the tower was silent and
peaceful. The thunder of battle that
had once rolled round its base was
hushed
!
The cry of the warrior, the shriek
of the fallen, the clangour of steel
meeting
steel, the roar of warlike engines
were silenced. Repose and loneliness
and peace seemed to have made it their
home.
Alfozo, reflecting in this strain, began
to ascend a flight of hewn steps that led
to the portal of the tower. He passed
around the angle of the ruined bastion,
and came all at once upon a neat
whitewashed
kasah
, or vine-dresser's cottage,
sheltered by the wall of the tower on one
side, and by the face of the cliff on the
other. It was before its door that the
two sycamores grew. The moonlight
fell full and pleasantly upon the small
green plat adorned with roses and
blossoming
flowers, before the door, and
revealed
a spot of loveliness rarely found
in such a remote and secluded region.
The cottage or casah was built of
stone from the bastion, in a neat
manner
,
was flat-roofed, and its spotless
white walls were only seen through the
interstices of vines that clambered all
over it, so profusely that it resembled a
bower. Before the door was a bench,
and under each of the two windows was
a bench, on which humble vases of
flowers were placed, half veiling the
casement. The little space between the
door and the wall was about forty feet
wide, green as soft verdure could make
it, and containing little plots of mountain
plants and the two gigantic sycamores.
Back of the cottage rose sublimely into
the starry heavens the wooded face of
the Sierra. To the south, through an
opening between the mountain and the
bastion, was a glimpse over forest,
garden
,
plain, and fertile meadow, of the
white minarets of Cordova, beyond which
remoter far, against the margin, like
blue-tinted shadows, the faintly-seen
masses of the Sierra Nevada.
Alfonzo lingered an instant as he came
upon this little paradise, as if fearing to
disturb its peaceful beauty by his
presence
.
He then, with his finger on his
lip, walked softly forward, and was
about to approach the window nearest to
him, when a huge dog bounded from the
shadow of the building, and without a
voice, other than a low, fierce growl,
leaped towards him, as if he would rend
him. But, ere he made the second
bound, he crouched at his feet and
whined recognition. Alfonzo patted the
shaggy beast upon his head and then tap
ped at the window, by the side of which
hung, like trophies, rather than for
present use, an old shield and two or
three sheathed yatagans, belonging to
the owner of the cottage.
He tapped a second time, and then,
putting aside the trellis, looked in. The
moon-beams that he admitted showed
a small neat chamber, with a spotless
couch, but no occupant. Voices fell
upon his ear from an inner room. He
was about to leave the window to enter
by the door, when a hand was lightly
laid upon his shoulder, and a musical
voice pronounced gladly, but in a low
tone, his name.
CHAPTER IV.
THE INFIDEL MAIDEN.
The
young mountaineer turned
quickly
round, and, with an exclamation of
delight, clasped to his heart a lovely
maiden of a beautiful form and an air of
wild mountain grace, mingled with a
modesty
so captivating, a bearing so proud
and free, that she seemed a fit mate for
the noble, manly gazelle-keeper, who
was gazing so affectionately into her dark
moon-lit eyes. Such eyes ne'er had
gazelle
as hers. So large, and bright, and
starry, and so beaming with love and
the tenderness of passion.
`Genilla,' he said, `I feared you were
away again. I was just about entering
the door to seek you.'
`Allah be praised that you did not!'
she answered fervently. I am so glad
you are come. It is three daysthree
long days, Alfonzo since I have seen
you.'
`I have seen you every moment,
dearest
Genilla. I have to look into my heart
to find your image there always.'
`And do you think I forget you? How
is it you have not been here?'
`I have had much trouble with my
gazelles of late. They have four times,
in the last three days, wandered far out
of their usual track upon the mountains,
and I have spent many hours in search
of them. The night before last I was
upon the mountain till dawn.'
`How I tremble when I reflect upon
your dangers at such times, dear
Alfonzo
,'
said the dark-eyed girl, looking up
into the face of her lover with beaming
eyes that seemed moistened with tears of
affectionate solicitude. `One false step
in those hours of darkness, and you
would perish! Would that you could
turn to some other pursuit, my noble
Alfonzo. Oh, that you would listen and
be persuaded to'
`Not a word more, Genilla,' he said
playfully, yet firmly; `I know what you
would say. I am a Christian and not a
Moor!'
`You should, for my sake, seek the
service of the Emir,' she continued
warmly. `If thon lovest me, Alfonzo,
thou canst not hate my people!'
`For thy sake, I would do them good
and not evil. For thy sake I have done
them kindness, when it was in my power
to injure them. But more than this, I
cannot. I would rather be the free
gazelle-keeper
upon the mountains, exposed
to death by the precipices and the wolves,
rather than take service with the chiefs
of thy race. Speak no more to me upon
this subject, Genilla!'
The maiden folded her fair hands upon
her bosom, and sighed and remained
silent. Alfonzo led her gently along a
narrow walk, bordered with wild flowers,
which wound round the cottage, and
thence held its serpentine way up the
mountain. They walked on a little way
together, until they came to a smooth
rock, hollowed out beneath a trickling
mountain stream, that had filled the
cavity
.
A few gold and silver fishes glanced
about in the pool, their glittering scales
reflecting the moonlight, as it found its
way to them through the foliage of an
acacia that grew from a crevice in the
rock, and bent gracefully over it. There
was a stone bench against the natural
wall by the fountain, and a bed of moss
before it for the feet to rest upon.
`Let us sit here, Genilla,' said Alfonso,
as he drew her gently to the seat. `How
delicately the distant minarets sparkle in
the beams of the young moon, which
looks upon a hundred rivals in Cordova!
Would it were the cross the moon shone
upon. Father Godfrey says that he
remembers
when a hundred golden crosses
caught, and flung back the glory of the
morning sun. Would those good days
were come again, Genilla. But I see
that you like not the subject. I know, if
I love thee, I must love thee as thou
art; but would to God thou wert a
Christian
!'
`Would to Allah thou wert a true
believer
,
Alfonzo!' said the maiden,
earnestly
,
her dark eyes lighting up with
beautiful enthusiasm.
`We will not talk of this now. Who
was with thy father when I tapped at thy
window, and where were you, Genilla,
when I came?'
`I was in the tower looking for thee,
and listening for thy step. I expected
thee to-night, for if thou hadst not come
I should have been sad and filled with
fears of thy safety. I saw thee come up
the path and listen at the lattice. I came
out of the tower and touched thee just in
time to keep thee from entering rashly.'
`Who is with thy father?'
`The Chistian hermit.'
`Not father Godfrey!' exclaimed
Alfonzo
,
with amazement.
`Yes. He came about a quarter
of an hour ago. I was in my lattice
singing to my littah when I beheld his
tall, majestic figure crossing the green to
the door. I trembled, I hardly knew
why; but since he used to come and talk
to me of Christ, I have feared him. Yet
I would have warned him, for thy sake,
that my father, Ben Osmin, was at home.
I ran forth for this purpose, supposing he
had come as heretofore to persuade me
to become a Christian, to tell him his
danger
,
when seeing me he directly asked
for Ben Osmin.'
`Asked for the stern Moor?'
`Yes. He said to me, Daughter, I
would see thy father. Lead me to him!'
`And you obeyed?'
`While he was speaking, Wolf, the
dog, was making a deep growling noise
which brought my father to the door.
Upon seeing him I expected I knew not
what scene of horror, for my father loves
not a Christian. But upon seeing the
hermit, for the moon showed him plainly
to him, he advanced with courtesy and
taking bis hand, said,
`Enter, Christian in the name of
Allah
.'
`This is surprising. It was hither then
that the father was coming.'
`He seemed to be expected. My
father
led him into the house, and at the
same time bade me walk awhile in the
moon-light as he had a private talk to
hold with the hermit. So I wandered
into the tower and stood in the window
waiting for you and wondering at this
strange visit of the hermit to my father.'
`It is strange indeed. I know not
what it can mean. He cannot hope to
convert Ben Osmin. Yet he and Ben
Osmin can have no business together in
common. It is very strange that the holy
father should leave his mountain lodge at
night to come hither.'
`Perhaps they have business together.
In Cordova Christian and Infidel traffic
together, jostle each other in the Bazaars,
and dwell at peace within the same
walls. Why should not two meet
here? Are not you and I proof that they
may, Alfonzo?' she asked, smilingly.
`But I have not inquired of thee how that
fair mountain maid, thy sister, is?'
`Xariffa is well, and each day wishes
thou wert a Christian.'
`Then she knows her brother loves
the daughter of the Moor?'
`I have told her.'
`And did not her dark eyes flash with
anger, Alfonzo.'
`Oh, no; she said that she hoped I
should be the instrument in leading you
to the truth. Twice only have you met
each other, but often enough, I know, to
be mutually interested in one another.
`She is very beautiful! I love her
because she is so like you I saw in her
eyes and in her smile the smile and eyes
I love.'
`The consciousness that I am beloved
by you, Genilla, is bliss to me. I dwell
upon your sweet image when I am alone
upon the mountain, I dream of you in
the night. The stars remind me of the
light of your eyes, the singing of the
birds of your voice. Were it not for you
for my love for you'
`Well, Alfonzo, why do you place
your face between your hands and heave
a sigh so sad?'
`I cannot breathe the words that came
to my lips. It may not be. Yet I do
not fear to trust you.'
`Fear to trust me, Alfonzo?' she said
with accents of touching reproach. Fear
Genilla! I thought our hearts, our hopes,
our lives, were one.'
`No, I do not fear to trust you, dearest
girl, though our faiths differ, our hearts
beat as one heart in one bosom. You
shall hear all I would have said. But for
my love for thee, instead of serving the
Moor in the Emir's guard as thou wouldst
have me, I would take up arms against
him were there a Chief to be found in
Spain.
`These words from thee! This spirit
in the bosom that Genilla believed
throbbed
only for himself! wouldst thou indeed
arm this hand which now holds mine in
its bound grasp with the steel of war to
pierce the heart of my father, of my
countryman!'
`Do not take my words with such
spirit, Genilla! There is no need! God
knows we have no leader in Spain. The
land is sunk in bondage to the Moor.
The scymetar has struck down the cross;
the Mosque has displaced the cathedral!
The Priests of God are flown into Italy
or have perished by the sword, or live
exiled in the mountains like the holy
father Godfrey himself, once the Abbot
of the richest monastery in Spain. Chiefs
we have none. Our nobles are out-laws;
our Princes have perished. The Moor
reigns in the palace of Amalarie and
the Convent of the Blessed Virgins has
become a harem for Algezir the Eimr.
Thou mayest, therefore, laugh, but not
be angry at my words; for they are
only
words
. They will never be more
than words!'
`Alfonzo, I will neither laugh nor
be angry. It is natural that you
should feel as you do, being a Spaniard
and a Christian. But look! behold the
cloud of glittering crescents that shines
above the walls of Cordova! These
should show you that the power of the
Prophet is established in the land and
that the followers of the Nazarene have
no more hope! You should therefore
cease to dwell upon your past greatness
as a nation and submit to the rules of
my people. It cannot be remedied.
The destiny of your race is sealed.
The Prophet is fated to hold empire
here forever. Be wise, then, cling no
longer to a crushed and fallen faith, and
embrace that of the true Apostle of
God!'
`I know there is no hope, at least I
see none, Genilla! But I can never rest
quietly under the yoke of Islam. I can
never become a follower of the False
Prophet!'
`Be it so. So that we love let there
be peace between us!' said the maiden
laying her hand upon his shoulder and
looking up affectionately into his serious
face. `This is heavy conversation for us,
Alfonzo. Let me sing to thee! You are
gloomy and I will sing thee a lively
ballad
.
It shall be of the fortunes of an
Andalusian maiden who was taken
captive
by Taric the Conqueror!'
`No, I care not to listen now to songs
of Moorish valor, Genilla. I am
interested
to know what can be the subject of
the interview between the father
Godfrey
and Ben Osmin.'
`When he has gone, my father, who
keeps no secrets from me, will tell me,
then shalt thou know! Did you see
ought of a hunting party from Cordova,
on the mountains to-day?'
`Did one pass here?' asked Alfonso
quickly.
`Through the defile below, within a
quarter of a mile. But they were half
concealed by the trees, yet I could see
it was a brave show of arms and horses,
banners and silks, with lively bugling.
`How large a party?'
`No less than three score. It was an
Emir at the very least. No doubt they
went into the mountain to hunt wolves.'
`If they were keepers of goats on the
Sicrras, they would see little pastime in
hunting the wolf. When did you say
they went by?'
`About an hour after the sun was up.'
`Then none of them have come back
that you have seen?'
`No; doubtless they have issued by
yon defile and returned to the city.'
`I heard hunters on the hills to the
southward of me during the day, and
about noon a wounded wolf dashed
howling
past me as I was dining from my
wallet a thousand feet up the mountain.
I have yet more to tell thee. As I was
coming down the Sierra path with father
Godfrey, a youthful Moor, richly attired
and armed with a shattered boar-spear,
came into the path; and, the way being
narrow, and we being in it resting, he
sternly bade us stand aside, and suffer him
to precede us down the mountain!'
`And what did you?' she asked
earnestly
.
`I thought of you and stood aside.
But the holy hermit remained firm. The
Moor advanced upon him as if to run him
through, and I had raised my hand to
catch the spear when the young infidel
sunk upon his knees and fell over lifeless
and bleeding!'
`A
miracle
performed by the hermit!'
she cried between scorn and surprise.
`No; he had been a short time before
wounded by a boar's tusk, and was
hastening
from the mountains when he met
us. But his strength failed him and he
fell senseless at our feet.'
CHAPTER V.
THE EMIRS.
The
young Moorish girl, upon hearing
the account given thus by her lover,
prepared
her mind to hear of the death of
the Saracen hunter by his hand. He saw
by the expression of her countenance that
she expected him to announce this to her.
He quietly answered her suspicions by a
smile ere he said:
`And doubtless you believe that I left
him there to die, Genilla, or that I
hastened
his end with my steel's point?'
`I know not what you did. I pray you
let me know quickly. I would know
whether I sit by the side of a murderer
of one of my countrymen!' she said
haughtily.
`I raised him upon my shoulders, after
father Godfrey and I had dressed his
wounds, and bearing him down the
mountain
,
I placed him on my own couch in
my hut. I left him there an hour ago
asleep, and under my father's charge.
Before I left the hermit took his departure,
bidding me take good care of him, and
when he awoke administer a cordial which
he left. In this way did I avenge my
countrymen's wrongs upon thine,
Genilla
!'
`Forgive me, Alfonso.'
`Thou hast not offended. It was
natural
that you should suppose I should hate
the Moor; but I thought of thee and
treated
him as if he had been my brother.
Besides, he being wounded, I looked upon
him as an object of benevolence rather
than of enmity. Beneath my father's
roof sleeps in peace the Infidel, who
tomorrow
,
if he were well and strong, would
not hesitate to level it to the ground, and
give our heads to the scymetar.'
`Judge them not so harshly, Alfonso.
Thou hast done a noble deed. This shall
be remembered by me whenever I hear
thee, in thy excited moments, vent thy
anger upon my people. Who was this
Moor?'
`I know him not I have seldom seen,
Saracen though he be, a nobler face.'
`You said his costume was rich!'
`Very; and he wore a prince's ransom
in jewels about his person.'
`Wore he a green turban?'
`Yes.'
`He is a descendant of the Prophet.
He is one of the sons of the Emir, I
doubt not. Did you see a ring on his
finger with a green stone in it?'
`Yes,'
`Did you examine the device?'
`A key.'
`Then thy guest is a Prince, Alfonzo.'
`Sayest thou so!'
`These are the insignia of an Emir.'
`There are a score of Emirs in the
realm of Cordova who since the
assassination
of Prince Ayub Musa have been
aspiring to the Emir's throne. Which can
this be?'
`I know not. It should be one of the
first rank. It was his train who passed
this morning to the hunt. And in this
way he returns wounded, and the guest
of the Christian herdsman Gasper. What
can have become of his followers?'
`He must, in the ardor of pursuit,
have wandered from them. No doubt they
are seeking him still on the mountain.'
`Yes. Hear that winding bugle. I
have heard it twice before, but mistook it
for the lowing of kine. They still seek
him.'
`Genilla, whether the wounded Moor
be an Emir or not, I am ignorant. He
is a Moor, which is the same to me.
Were he a water-carrier of Cordova, he
should be as sacredly my guest. But I
do not wish his followors to find him in
my cabin. It is a quiet home into which
the foot of the Saracen has never yet
intruded
.
So, if to-night those who seek
him should pass this way by the tower
aud ask for him, let it not be known that
you know where he is.'
`What shall I answer them?'
`Say you have not seen him?'
`But they ought to know their Prince
is safe, though wounded.'
`Send them not to my quiet home to
seek him. Father Godfrey says that in
three days he will be restored to health.
He shall then depart. I will guide him
to Cordova in safety. For thy sake he
shall go free, were he the Imperial
Caliph
of Damascus.'
`I will obey you, Alfonso.'
Thanks. Thou knowest that I have a
fair and dearly loved sister. Her beauty
in these dangerous times is her greatest
snare. Let the eyes of any of these
Saracen knights light upon her modest
beauty, and the sweet flower of my
humble
home would be plucked, though I
should perish in her defence. Send them
not thither, Genilla, if thou lovest me!'
`I will not, Alfonzo.'
`Thanks. Three days away from
Cordova will not be long. I would show
him how a Christian peasant can show
hospitality to a Moorish prince, if prince
he be, as he may be, for he had princely
bearing with him.'
`None but the descendants of the
prophet wear the green turban, and only
a Prince of the line, the signet graven
with a key, the insignia of the Morisco
Empire.'
`Be it so. There sounds afar off
another
bugle. Sound on Infidel; thy
leader
sleeps soundly and hears thee not.'
`Hist. There are footsteps. It is my
father and the hermit. See, they walk
forth together. They take leave of each
other with ceremony, and he departs.'
`How strange. May it not be that
Ben Osmin is a Christian?'
`My father false to his faith,' repeated
the maiden, with a haughty air. `Sooner,
Alfonzo, wilt thou find Genilla false to
thee.'
`And yet thou art false to me, sweet
Genilla, so long as thou refusest to
become
a Christian. But hither comes Ben
Osmin. Shall I meet him boldly? He
knows I love thee.'
`And he hath forbidden me on pain of
death to hold interview with thee.'
`I will defend thee.'
`What. Draw thy steel against my
father? Retire within the shadow of the
rock. You cannot pass him unseen.
Wert thou only a Moslem, Alfonzo,' she
said, reproachfully, `this secresy need
not be. Hide quickly?'
Alfonzo drew back half a dozen steps
so that the acacia, aided by a projection
in the rock, effectually concealed his per
son to the eye of a casval observer. The
beautiful Moorish girl then advanced to
meet her father who was calling her by
name.
`Ho, Genilla. Where art thou, child?
`Here, father.'
`Allah be praised,' ejaculated the old
man, as he came forward. He was a
short fleshy man, in a huge white turban,
a black kaftan, and red sash in which was
stuck a yataghan. His trowsers were of
white linen of the amplest volume about
the red slippered feet. Ben Osmin was
a Mooor by birth, and had been captain
of a galley in the fleet which brought
over Taric and his army twenty years
before
.
He gained great fame and some
wealth in the taking of Cordova, and
settled
down to enjoy himself after his wars
on land and his perils by flood. He was
a person of cheerful temper, and had a
rare talent at making the most of the
sources of happiness in his way. He
was a bachelor, that is, he had no harem,
for he had a great horror of a sex that
had no souls, and to whom the Prophet
denied even a corner in Paradise.
But one day, as Ben Osmin sat upon
his Divan, thinking of nothing in
particular
,
as was his custom, (for pipe smoking
in that early age was unknown,) and
sipping
sherbert through a silver tube, a
slippered
Moor in blue caftan and soiled
turban
came near and said,
`Salaam, Ben Osmin. Here is a bale
of rich shawls the Mufti hath sent thee
for thy valour in the wars in defence of
the true faith.'
`Allah be praised, and Paradise be to
the Mufti and all his generations,'
answered
Ben Osmin. `Take this gold plece
and say the words I have spoken to the
Mufti.
The slave departed hastily, thrusting
the gold piece into his girdle as he went
out. Ben Osmin now fixed his eyes upon
the bale of shawls with glances of
mingled
admiration and delight. The size
of the bale, the beauty of the covering,
the courtesy of the Mufti, and the
reflection that his bravery was
remembered
,
made his eyes sparkle, and
overflowed
his heart with joy and universal
benevolence.
`Allah be praised.' God is God,' he
ejaculated more than seven times, with
an interval of at least three minutes
between
each ejaculation. At length he
laid aside his sherbet tube, and clapped
his hands thrice. An African slave in
white turban and white tunic entered,
and bowed reverently before Ben Osmin
his master.
`Hussan, thou seest that bale of rich
shawls! It is a present from the Mufti,
the defender of the Faith, to me Ben
Osmin
in consideration of the skulls of
Christians I have cloven through in my
days of valour. Unloose the cords. Let
me feast my eyes on the gift of the Mufti
Allah be praised forever.'
The African approached the bale of
shawls, and undoing the cords by which
it was bound cast them aside, and then
unrolled the outer shawl.
`Beard of the Prophet! what have we
there?' cried the amazed Ben Osmin, as
the removal of the shawl revealed a wicker
basket open at the top, in which lay fast
asleep a sweet little infant about a month
old. The slave fell back in amazement,
and showed his glittering teeth from ear
to ear, while the warlike Moor stroked his
beard several times with rapidity and
ejaculated,
`Allah be praised! Hussuf what seest
thou?'
`An infant, Effendi!'
`By the harem of the Soldanhow is
it that my bale of shawls hath turned into
the child of a woman! God is good!
What must be, is to be. Allah be
praised!'
With these exclamations of
astonishment
,
the Moor bade Hussuf to take the
babe out of the basket, that he might look
at it the closer.
`Mishallah!' he cried, `it is fair to
look upon, though something small; but
please Allah it will grow. What is that
in the bottom of the basket?' he cried,
pointing to a piece of parchment, on
which were traced certain characters in
Arabic. `Place it in my hands!'
The slave obeyed, and Ben Osmin read
as follows:
`To the discreet and brave Ben
Osmin
,
health and peace, Greeting:This
gift is sent thee by one who honors thee.
Shawls will decay, and time tarnishes
their beauty; but a soul is immortal.
Let Ben Osmin see that the infant be
cared for, for he himself is a child in the
hand of Allah, and is daily fed from the
stores of his bounty. God is good and
Mahomet is his prophet!'
`Bismillah!' exclaimed Ben Osmin;
`a child is better than a bale of shawls.
Hussuf, seek out a nurse forthwith, lest
it die on my hands, and I have to answer
for its life to Isfrael.'
The slave disappeared on his errand,
and soon returned with the wife of Aben
Hassen, the turban-maker in the next
street, who pledged herself to take charge
of the infant till it should walk for a gold
betsch the month.
`Allah be praised!' said Ben Osmin,
as the woman departed with the babe and
he resumed the silver pipe of his sherbet
cup. `A child is better than a bale of
shawls. I will call it Genilla, and it shall
be a shawl of love to my heart when I
get old.'
So Ben Osmin named the infant
Genilla
,
which signified a shawl of silk,
and every day he walked to Hassan's
shop to have a sight of his protege, in
which he took increasing interest as it
began
to advance to take notice of him, and
by and bye to amuse him with its smiles
and prattle.
`Bismallah!' he said one day to
Hassan
,
`here am I a bachelor, and yet I
have the prettiest daughter in all
Andalusia
.
Allah be praised!'
The infant Genilla grew apace to
girlhood
,
and, when she had reached her
twelfth year, gave promise of being the
fairest maiden in Cordova. Old Ben
Osmin worshipped her with pride and
love. But at length the Emir or
Imperial
Caliph, who held the government
under
the sceptre of the Caliph of
Damascus
,
the Emperor of all Islam, died. It
was necessary to send to Damascus to
learn who should be his successor. In
the interval, two of the principal Emirs,
who had been generals of Taric the
Conqueror, aspired to the vice-royalty to
govern till the return of the messenger.
This aspiration created two parties in the
city, and, in a severe battle that took
place between them, both were slain.
But, hydra-like, no less than eleven
Emirs now raised their standards and
asserted
their claims to the Caliphate. At
this juncture, Suleyman, who reigned in
Barbary, interposed and appointed Abury
Musa, the nephew of the late Emir, to
hold the reins of government. But in a
few weeks Musa was assassinated by
Algezir
,
a powerful Emir, and once more
Cordova was the scene of civil war
between
the Moors.
At length the new Emir arrived from
Damascus, but only to find his throne in
the hands of Algezir. He raised the
standard of the Prophet against him, and
calling on all good Moslems to rally
around it, he advanced upon Cordova,
and defeating the Emir's forces,
eompelled
him to fly to the Sierras for safety.
He took refuge in the tower beneath
which Ben Osmin now dwelt so
peacefully
,
and, after enduring a long siege,
was compelled to yield at discretion. As
he was an Emir, and the blood of the
Prophet flowed in his veins, his blood
was not shed, but he was banished to
Africa. The Caliph thus won his throne.
Ben Osmin had joined the Caliph, and
for his instrumentality in bringing about
the capture of the Emir in his tower, he
had been rewarded with the tower by the
Caliph, and a vineyard adjacent. Hither,
therefore, he came to dwell; but, instead
of inhabiting the tower, he constructed,
with great taste, for the comfort of his
foster daughter rather than his own, the
cottage adjoining it: and here for four
years he had been dwelling in peace,
undisturbed by the commotions that from
time to time rended the city. For the
Caliph had not heen two years on his
throne, ere the Emir, Algezir, returned,
raised a standard of rebellion, deposed
him to be in his turn overthrown by a
conspiracy of fourteen Emirs, who, too
jealous to concede power to either singly,
reigned conjointly, but each watching an
opportunity to reign alone.
CHAPTER VI.
THE WOLF-SLAYER.
The
Moor, Ben Osmin, had remained
in quiet at his cottage by the tower during
all the warlike excitement in the city;
and so that he was undisturbed in the
society
of Genilla, and in the culture of his
acre of vineyard, he was content, and it
mattered little to him whether one Emir
or twenty held the reigns of government
in Cordova.
`Allah be praised!' he repeated a
second
time on beholding his foster
daughter
approaching him from the fountain
behind which Alfonzo had concealed
himself. `I was afraid thou hadst
wandered
away, and, by the beard of the
Prophet, the neighborhood is none of the
safest for a maiden to trust herself in.
Hearest thou the bugles of the hunters
among the hills! I would rather they
that blow them would keep there than
come nigher my dovecote. There are
unruly gallants always to be found in an
Emir's hunting train! Hast thou been
lonely, child?' he asked, taking her hand
and addressing her with great kindness,
and a countenance sparkling with the
deep affection of his heart.
`No, father,' she answered, richly
colouring and dropping with slight
confusion
the lids of her dark Arabian eyes.
`I am right glad of it, for I had
business
that kept me.'
`Business, father? What couldst thou
have to say to the Christian hermit?'
`It is not for thine ears, sweet,'
answered
Ben Osmin, smlling. `I ne'er
heard of a woman that could keep a
secret
.
But one day, perhaps, I may tell
thee, but not now.'
`I do not like secrets, father.'
`Then, Mishillah! thou shalt not be
troubled with this.'
`I mean I do not like them when I
dont't know them.'
`Oh, that is it. By the beard of the
Prophet! when thou knowest it, a secret
it is no longer.'
`I will find it out ere long, dear
father
!'
`Dost thou threaten me, pretty one?'
`I will ask the hermit Godfrey.'
`Thou?' cried Ben Osmin with alarm.
`I will go up the mountain to his cave
and he will not refuse to tell me,' she
said with playful firmness.
`Daughter, thou must not go near this
Christian monk. Thy words have
alarmed
me. Go not nigh him. Pass no words
with him if he cross thy path, if thou hast
reverence or love for me.'
`Is it so serious, then?'
`It is. He might tell thee what I
refuse
to tell. It is not good for thee to
know it. Besides, what he says may be
false. I will yet talk further with him
after I have been to Cordova, and then I
may tell thee!'
`Art thou going to Cordova?' cried
the maiden with delight beaming in her
beautiful face. `You will take me with
you, good dear Ben Osmin!' and as she
spoke she entwined her graceful arms
about his bearded throat and kissed his
smooth well-fed cheek with the most
winning temptation. `Do not say no!'
`By the turban of the Prophet, what
can I say?' responded the Moor in
perplexity
.
`Thou must stay at home. I
have business.'
`It is so lonely here! I have not seen
the city since I was a child.'
`You cannot go, child. The city is in
sight from the tower. Thou seest it daily.'
`But I wish to go there!'
`It is a dangerous time to take thee
there. Any day a revolution may break
out. The Emirs are as jealous of each
other as so many wolves watching a
goat-pen. I should not be surprised to
hear that some one of them had raised
the green standard and proclaimed
himself
Supreme Caliph. It would not be
afe for thee there. Besides, I am afraid
of the gay Saracen cavaliers and
rampant
Andalusian knights that might rob
me of thee! Praised be Allah! thou art
secure here, and no one of them
knoweth
what a treasure is hid here! Don't
ask me, Genilla.'
`I am not afraid of the knights and
cavaliers, father!'
`Bismillah! I would have thee afraid
of them. Thou shalt stay here.'
`If thou leavest me, father, I will go
up the mountain while thou art gone, and
see the Christian Monk.'
`The Prophet knew what he was about
when he shut Paradise against women!
Elbilirah! Thou shalt go with me.
Allah be praised that is settled!'
`I am so delighted! I shall now see
the beautiful city, the splendid mosques,
the palaces, the knights and cavaliers,
the princes' and ladies. Oh, dear Ben
Osmin, how very happy I shall be. You
are so good.'
`On my soul be it! Three women
like thee would keep a man from
Paradise
.'
`When do you go, dear father?' asked
the gazelle-eyed Genilla, as she hung
fondly upon his shoulder.
`I must go early in the morning. I
will ride on horseback, and thou shalt
have the mule accoutred, and amble by
my side.'
`I shall dream only of Cordova all
night, father!'
`We must to our beds, if we are to
start so early. In the city there still
lives old Aben Hassan, the turban-maker,
and I will have thee at his house. It is
retired and out o' the way o' the range
o' the young cavaliers. Come, let us in,
daughter!'
`I will, father, in a moment,' she
answered
,
slipping back towards the
fountain
;
`I have left my bracelet on the
stone bench under the acacia.
`How could you drop your bracelet?
But get it and come in, for it is a heavy
dew.'
Genilla did not tell him that her lover
had accidentally unclasped it from her
wrist, for it would have been to betray
his presence which she wished to
conceal
from him. She saw her father go
round the cottage to enter it, and then
picking up her bracelet she approached
Alfonzo, who came forth from his hiding
place, and clasped her hand.
`Now you must go without delay,
Alfonzo
!'
she said quickly. `If I linger
my father will return, and discover you!
To-morrow night I shall be back from the
city. I shall then see you and have a
great deal to tell you.'
`I would rather you would not go to
Cordova, dearest Genilla,' said Alfonzo,
with a tone of regret at her intention.
`As Ben Osmin says, it is a dangerous
place for a maiden, so fair as thou art!'
`Jealous already, dear Alfonzo,' said
the Moorish beauty, bearing upon him
her splendid eyes, while her delicate
fingers tapped playfully his cheek.
`Fear me not! I shall fall in love with
none of the young Emirs at court.
Besides
,
I am but a poor humble girl, the
daughter of a vintner. I fear not that
any admiring eye will be turned upon
me. I shall be safe in my obscurity, and
the humility of Aben Hassan's house.
I only wish to gaze on the magnificence
of which I have heard so much, and of
which I retain a girlish memory.'
`I will say no more lest thou shouldst
suppose I fear any knight should look on
thee. If I thought thou lovedst me
because
thou hast seen no other man, I
should little prize thy love, Genilla, and
might fear it could be turned from me to
the first jewelled and gay cavalier that
chanced to bend his gaze on the! But
I know thee better, and can trust thee even
in the gay and free city of Cordova!'
`I shall return to value and love thee
more. If thou only wert a follower of
the true faith,but I see a frown
gathering
upon thy brow. We will let faiths
alone. We will love for this world alone;
faiths belong to a hereafter.'
`Not wholly, dear Genilla! But we
will not embitter this brief parting
moment
by a subject on which, I fear, we
can never see alike. One day I trust to
see thee turn from a religion which
denies
to woman immortality, and embrace
that of the son of Mary, the beloved
Virgin
mother, through whom all women are
blessed and honoured evermore. Good
night, love! I will be here again
tomorrow
night at this hour!'
`I will see thee at the fountain!'
`Has Ben Osmin spoken about me of
late?'
But once. When he heard how you
had saved three peasants from being torn
to pieces by wolves, he said, `He is a
brave youth, and were he a good
musselman
,
he would be glad to see thee at the
tower. But since he found us
conversing
together in the path at the foot of
the rock, and saw that we liked one
another
too well, he forbade me to see you,
as he forbade you to think of me mere.
He is grateful to you for the service you
did me, very grateful, but he can never
forgive you for being a Christian.'
The lovers now parted, and Genilla
entered the cottage, casting many a
lingering
look behind, while Alfonzo, with
a thoughtful brow, walked slowly down
the tower hill and descended into the
forest path, in the gloom of which he was
soon threading his way back to the hamlet.
We have alluded to a service done by
Alfonzo to the Moorish maiden, and
which was the foundation of their first
acquaintance and of their love. Alfonzo
had been brought up in the obscure
hamlet
of the mountain gorge as a keeper of
goats and gazelles; such being the
occupation
of Gaspar, who having fled to
the Sierras from the sword of the Moors,
turned himself to this as a means of
subsistence
.
Gaspar was a noble of Spain, a man
of uncalculating mind, but of great
courage
and integrity. He had lost his
possession
with the rest of his caste, and
houseless he fled to the hills with
hundreds
of his countrymen. Many
perished
from hunger, many secreted
themselves
in caves and lived by hunting,
more banded themselves as robbers of
their conquerors, and lived by rapine;
while others joined themselves with the
dwellers of the mountains and became
herdsmen. Among these was Gaspar,
the rough hearted, strong handed noble.
He soon became attached to his
occupation
,
for there was a certain excitement
in it. Wolves constantly prowled in
packs to way-lay and destroy his charge,
and the fiercer banded exiles of the hills
sallied forth upon his flocks to plunder
them for sustenance. In defending his
herds against wolves and bandits, he won
a name for the prowess that made him
respected and feared in all the Sierras.
The fame of Gaspar the Wolf-killer had
reached even the streets and
marketplaces
of Cordova.
Trained in such a school, Alfonzo grew
up fearless and skilful, and became a
conqueror in many a fierce contest upon
the monntains with the beasts and robbers
that infested it. Side by side with his
father, and aided only by a huge
wolfdog
,
he had put to flight and defeated a
band of twelve famished robbers who
had pounced upon his flock; till at length
his herds roamed and browsed with
safety
upon the loneliest places of the hills,
while the flocks of others were daily
diminished
.
At length the mountaineers, unable
longer to endure the ravages upon their
flocks resolved to band together, and hunt
the bandits from their fastnesses in the
Sierras. They assembled to the number
of four score, each attended by his fierce
wolf-dog, a formidable opponent to an
armed man. Over this small but resolute
force they appointed Gaspar as captain,
and Alfonzo as second in command. This
was about six months before the opening
of our story. The expedition was
assembled
secretly and went forth secretly. It
was successful. The robbers, taken by
surprise, were defeated in every
encounter
.
They were driven from their strong
holds, and from the Sierras for several
leagues space. Alfonzo covered himself
with glory by his bravery as well as
distinguished
himself by his judgment and
military skill. Gaspar openly confessed
that the whole success of the expedition
was owing to the resolution and courage
of Alfonzo, an assertion to which all the
mountaineers gave their loudest
testimony
.
The young gazelle-keeper
received
their praises with that modesty
which always accompanies true bravery,
and from that hour he was the hero of
the Sierras; and the fame of Alfonzo the
Destroyer, as his enemies, the dispersed
bandits, universally denominated him,
penetrated the palaces of the Emirs, and
his deeds found commendation from the
lips of the youthful Moorish cavaliers that
hung about the court.
Up to this hour Alfonzo had not seen
the fair Moorish maiden who dwelt at the
white
kasah
beneath the tower of the rock.
CHAPTER VII.
THE MOORISH SONGSTESS.
The young mountaineer, a few weeks
after his gallant conquest over the
banditti
of the hills, was seated upon an
elevated
peak, watching the browsing
goats and bounding gazelles of his flock,
dispersed around him and beneath his
feet. From the position which he had
chosen for the purpose of keeping his
charge full in sight, there was a view of
the tower and the roof of the cottage of
Genilla at the foot of the mountain on the
eastern side. He had often gazed down
upon this secluded place from the height
upon which he now reclined, his dog Ban
by his side, his boar-spear lying across
his knee, and his eyes sharply wandering
over the erratic herd, which he had in
keeping, ready to send his watchful dog
to bring back any one of the flock that
seemed disposed to stray.
He had heard that a Moor dwelt in the
white walled cot, and this knowledge was
sufficient to keep him from ever
approaching
it, though at times some
straggling
gazelle would wander down that
side of the mountain and draw his steps
near the tower in his search after it. Still
he never went nigher the dwelling of the
Moor than was necessary. He had heard,
too, that the Moor who dwelt there had a
fair daughter. More than this, he knew
not. He had not heard even her name.
Perhaps those from whom he heard it,
never known it; as there was but little
communication between the conquered
Christian and the conquering Infidel.
It was a sunny afternoon. The bright
green undulations of the plain at his feet
were relieved by dark lines of forest, or
enlivened by the groves and gardens.
The air was so transparent that Cordova,
though two good leagues distant at the
shortest, seeemed as if the hand could be
laid upon it.
Every object was singularly distinct
and beautifully defined in every variation
of its out-line. The Guadalquiver, above
and below the city, beneath the walls of
which it was lost for a while to the eye,
shone and flowed brightly on its surface,
dotted by caiques decorated, with flags
shooting up and down the stream. The
villas and terraces, groves and gardens,
mosques and minarets, that stood upon
its banks were reflected from it as from
a mirror. The various winding roads
that led across the plain from the
mountains
or the river gorges, towards the
gates of the city, were here and there
enlivened by groups of travellers, or now
and then a single horseman coursing
along like the wind, marking his passage
by a long cloud of dust. Near the city
glittered the tents of a caravan of
merchants
about to set out on their journey
into Gaul, and winding through the defile
came slowly in sight a weary company
that had three weeks before crossed the
Pyrennees to barter their goods for
Moorish
gold. A troop of Saracen cavalry
were just entering a forest on the right,
with sounding bugles and banners
flaunting
.
The young mountaineer's eye
wandered
listlessly over scenes long familiar to his
eye and then let his gaze rest upon the
little Morisco cottage a thousand feet
below him. His eye was attracted to
the appearance of a female figure, which
even at that distance, he could discern,
was youthful and graceful. It at once
occurred to him that it was the Moor's
fair daughter of whom he had heard. A
little closer scrutiny assured him that she
wore the turban and white flowing
trousers
of the Saracen maiden.
He at once became interested in her
motions. She was, it seemed to him,
engaged
in training plants in the little green
court-yard. He could see every
movement
of her white arms, and he felt
confident
she was gathering flowers.
Once or twice she paused and seemed
to be looking upward to the mountain, as
if she had discovered him perched upon
the pinnacle against the blue sky. She
then suddenly disappeared. In a few
moments
a Moor came out and she was by
his side. They walked along the terrace
and sat down by the fountain. He now
knew that he saw the Moor and his
daughter. Hark! He bends his ear
eagerly and listens. The air is asleep.
Not a breath moves that would float a
thistle down. Suddenly the notes of
music come up the sky, floating on the
air like some celestial melody. Far
distant
and faint as it is, it is inconceivably
sweet, and for its very remoteness seems
to him to come from heaven.
At intervals a richer, clearer, more
thrilling note would reach his ear, when
his cheek would tingle and his dark,
handsome eyes beam and expand with a
new delight. The song went on. He
could not distinguish a word, for it was
doubtless Arabic; but had it been his
native Andalusian tongue, the far depth
would have rendered words
undistinguishable
.
He could not, moreover, hear
only now and then a wild, seraphine
strain that made his very heart-strings
vibrate with the sweetest sensations.
He forgets his gazelles! he forgets
where he is! He forgets that the
songstress
is the daughter of a Moor. He is
enchanted, bewildered, and, for the
moment
,
lost!
The music ceases. The singer
retires
,
not without looking, as he fancied,
up the cliff, and he sees her appear no
more, though he watched an hour, hoping
to hear once more that voice of passion
and melody.
At length he rose to his feet, and his
cheek burned with shame that he had
suffered his heart to be stirred by the
scarcely heard song of a Moorish maiden.
He felt that he had done a great evil,
and yielded to a temptation that his
conscience
would not acquit him of; for it
was no small portion of the Christian
faith of that day and nation to
hate
the
Infidel. Hatred of the other was usually
a good test of the orthodoxy of either
Mahommedan or Christian. Alfonzo felt,
therefore, that in suffering his senses to
be beguiled for a moment by the syren
song of an Infidel maid he had grievously
sinned; for he had lively religious
scruples
,
and as become the fashion of the
time, so far as belief in the Romish
miracles was concerned, was a faithful
son of the Church. He had been early
initiated into the mysteries of the
Christian
faith by the hermit Godfrey, who
often seeing him when a lad out upon the
hills with his gazelles, had taken a deep
interest in him, and taken much pains to
teach him all that was needful to make a
good Catholic of him. As to Gaspar the
wolf-slayer, a man was Christian enough
for him if he swore by the mass, instead
of by the beard of Mahomet. He hardly
knew the difference between the religions
of True Prophet and the False. He was
a Christian simply because he did not
happen to be a Moor. He swore by the
cross, and had a vague idea that there
was some sort of virtue in the cross that
would save his soul. But these nicer
matters he left to the priests.
But Alfonzo was taught by the hermit
to understand better the great principles
of the Christian faith, and to see clearly
that Mahomet was a false teacher,
and his followers deluded. He could
give a reason, which it would have
puzzled
Gaspar to do, for accepting the one
and rejecting the other.
It was not often that his occupation
would suffer him to visit the holy hermit
in his cell, and there listen to his
instructions
from the sacred scrolls, and hear
the wisdom that flowed from his lips.
But he learned enough to make him an
intelligent son of the Cross, to elevate
his character and guide his judgment.
His faith became, as it ever does when
received in honest trust, the conservator
of his principles.
A pleasing intercourse thus grew
between
the young gazelle-keeper and the
exiled abbot, and on the side of the latter
it manifested itself in parental
tenderness
,
and on the part of the former in
gratitude and filial reverence. Not a kid
was killed at tfle hamlet that Alfonzo did
not bear a portion of it to the cell of the
hermit, and he never let escape an
opportunity
of returning, by attention to his
few wants, his sense of the value of his
instructions.
When now, therefore, our youthful
mountaineer began suddenly to feel a
consciousness that he had done evil in
listening with such pleasure to the voice
of the Infidel songstress, he thought of
Father Godfrey, and how sternly he
would reprove him therefor. It was this
reflection that contributed quite as much
as his active conscience to deepen the
blush on his cheek as he rose to his feet.
But, if it were possible to have
heightened
the glow, it would have been
immeasurably
increased when, upon
looking
round him, he saw that nearly every
one of his flock had strayed out of sight,
not more than three or four being visible,
and these at a great distance off, on the
side of the mountain above him. His
dog, also, seemed to have been charmed
with the music, for he lay in a deep
slumber at his feet.
`How long can this charm have
lasted
?'
he exclaimed, amazed. `It seems
but a few minutes, yet my gazelles have
had time to stray far away unseen, and
the sun is an hour lower in the west. I
must do penance when I see the holy
hermit for this. I will try to forget that
voice so heavenly, if I can! But first,
I must hunt up my flock. Ho! Ban!
sleepest thou also! Up, and away!
Seek them and bring them back!'
The dog sprung from his repose, shook
his shaggy hide, and glancing first into
his master's face, and then sending his
eye over the mountain side, he bounded
away, emitting a low growl, as he leaped
from crag to crag.
The young mountaineer now eager to
redeem the time, unslung from his belt
a horn, tipped with an agate from the
brook, and sounding loud and long for a
minute, restored it to its place, and
followed
his dog with athletic bounds, not
even turning his eyes again in the
direction
of the Moorish cot beneath the tower.
It was already on the verge of
evening
when he found himself with all his
flock but one, a favorite gazelle,
collected
around him at the head of the
mountain
path, and guarded by his faithful
and panting dog. The one astray was
his sister's, a fair young girl, whose
chief delight it was to contribute to her
father and brother's happiness and
comfort
.
She prepared her brother's
morning
meal at early dawn, of fresh goat's
milk, and brown barley bread, and, at
evening when he returned, he always
found a warm supper awaiting him, with
her cheerful smile, and her voice of
sisterly
affection.
The wandering kid was hers. It had,
when very young, fallen from a
precipice
,
and broken one of its legs. Alfonzo
pitying its sufferings would have killed
it; but Xariffa, more merciful still,
pleaded
for its young life, for it was a very
beautiful soft-eyed kind, and seemed to
cast its gentle looks up to her as if
seeking
her protection, and he gave it into
her hands. Tenderly and assiduously
she nursed it, first skilfully setting the
slender bones of its leg, and fostered by
her care, it soon recovered health and
soundness. From this moment a bond
of affection was created between them.
The gazelle bounded to meet her, and
licked her hand, and to receive with
joyful
beaming eyes her fond caresses.
Whensoever she let it accompany her
brother to the mountain, for the herbage
was sweetest there, she would carefully
enjoin him to keep her favorite near him
and never let it stray out of his sight.
Sacredly had Alfonzo fulfilled the
trust until this day. But in the hour he
gave himself up to the song of the Moorish
maiden, and in watching for her
re-appearance
,
his precious charge strayed
with the rest; and when after three hours
toilsome exertion and much anxiety he
at length got them once more together,
lo, the kid, which for his beloved sister's
sake, was of more value than all, was
missing still!
His brow was sad. The solicitude of
his bosom was expressed in the sorrow
of his countenance.
`Poor little Zarif!' he said, looking
once more all around, to see if he could
not espy its soft bright eyes, peering
through the foliage of the mountain
heather, or the thickening shades of the
rocks. `I fear that thou hast met the
fate which thou didst escape in thy
infancy
!
I dare not behold the face of
my sister without thee, her loved gazelle.
Zarif! Hillo,oo, Zarif!' he shouted,
till the echoes of the mountains echoed
back again `Zarif.' Hast thou seen
nothing
of the pet kid, Ban? Go, look for
her.'
The dog understood his master, for
the sagacious animal was well aware that
one of the flock was missing. Tired as
he was he galloped off, and soon
disappeared
.
`If he does not find her, I shall be
wretched indeed. This is for listening
to the song of a Saracen maid! The
holy father hath ever told me that there
was necromancy and magic among the
Moors, and this comes of it!'
The thought of the holy father
reminded
him that he was near his cell, and,
seeing his dog soon return unsuccessful,
he resolved, though reluctantly, to turn
aside and confess all that he had done,
to the hermit.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE WOLF-CHASE.
Leaving
his faithful dog to guard his
herd in the pass, the young mountaineer
left the spot where they were collected
together, and going a few steps along
a ledge in the cliff-side, he came upon an
open space, about which grew several
clumps of wild olive trees. A group of
these concealed the entrance to a cave,
which he approached with the ready
tread of one familiar with the place.
The shadows were already heavy
before
the opening, and the cave was quite
dark. Still he advanced a few steps
into
it, when he came to an elevated
chamber
,
which received light from an iron
lamp, which burned before a
curiously-carved
altar of stone, supported by
sculptured
mermaids, upon which stood a
crucifix
and a cup.
The cave was about twenty feet high,
as many broad, and twice as many feet
in length. It was dry and clean, and
hung with two or three pictures of holy
scenes in Palestine. The lamp gave a
very dim light, and it was a minute before
the young man was convinced that the
hermit was not in his cave.
The pallet of dried wolf-skins, gifts of
his own, was empty; and the knee-worn
stones before the crucifix were no longer
occupied by the holy man of God. The
lamp still burning showed that he had been
there that day, and his rosary and a
scroll, laid down as if hastily left, showed
that he had not gone far, for these were
articles he never left the mountain
without
.
`I cannot wait for Father Godfrey,'
said the young penitent, as he gazed
around the dark vault with feelings of
religious awe, impressed by a silence
that was seldom broken, save by the
voice of prayer. `It is near the close of
day, and my flock will be belated on the
mountain if I linger. But the father hath
said prayer and confession ne'er bring
evil to any man; so I will fain kneel on
this sacred spot and confess to the Virgin
my heinous sin. By-and-by I will
confess
it to Father Godfrey and get
absolution
.
I wish I had ne'er listened to
Saracen
sorcery.'
With these words the young
mountaineer
reverently laid aside his
palm-leaf
hat and boar-spear, and even
unsheathed
and placed beside them upon
the ground his hunting-knife; he then
placed upon his brow a crown of thorns,
the points inward, worn, when at prayer,
by the hermit, bowed his head reverently
before the little altar, and kissed the
crucifix
with a penitential air.
`Mary mother, Virgin most holy,
intercede
for an erring son. I have been
tempted and have sinned in that I have
delighted my ear in the song of the
Saracen
.
It is my fault, my grievous
infirmity
,
and I have seen my guilt in the
just dispersion of my flock and the loss of
my sister's beloved gazelle. I will offend
no more, sweet Mother most holy.'
The sincere and ingenuous young
Catholic
mountaineer then kissed the
crucifix
again, and then rising to his feet,
started with surprise and pleasure, not
unmixed with shame; for he beheld
standing behind him, in the shadows, the
holy father, who carried in his bosom the
lost gazelle. His impulse to spring
forward
and caress the recovered kid was
checked by a quick sense of his
unworthiness
.
He therefore fell upon one knee
before the hermit, and knowing that he
must have been overheard in his
confession
,
he said,
`Father, forgive me. Thou hast heard
me confess to Heaven.'
`Thou hast absolution of thy fault, my
son, whatever it may be,' answered
Father
Godfrey, placing his open hand
upon
the top of his head. `As I forgive
thee on earth, may the Son of the Virgin
forgive thee in Heaven. But rise and
tell me what thou hast done.'
`I have listened with a delight I
cannot
express to the ravishing sounds of a
Moorish maiden, which ascended to my
ear from the house of the Infidel by the
tower, as I was seated upon the cliff
watching my flock. I suffered myself to
be so lost by the entrancing sounds, that
I forgot I was a keeper of gazelles, nay,
forgot I was a Christian, for an Infidel
Moor could not have listened with more
pleasure than I did.'
`Thou hast been in great danger, my
son. I trust thou hast not spoken with
the Moorish maiden?'
`No; I went not nigher than the top of
Alfar's cliff.'
`Then thou art safe.'
`Thou hast not heard all, holy father.
I have said I forgot where I was. My
herd wandered off and I saw them not.
At length I recovered from, or rather
broke from the charm, and found my
gazelles
had strayed I knew not whither.
After three tedious hours of anxious
search I gathered them again at the head
of the path to go down the mountain
every one save Zarif, the favorite of my
sister, and which to my great joy and
relief
I see nestled in the bosom of your
robe. Penitent and sorrowing for what
I had done, I sought your cave to make
confession, when finding you absent I
kneeled to confess to the Blessed Virgin
and her Babe, which I trust will be as
effectual
as if I had confessed to you, since
you heard me.'
`Yes, my son! I am glad to see such
ready contrition. That is truest
repentance
which soonest followest misdoing.
I am sorry that thou shouldst have
suffered
the voice of a Saracen sorceress to
have allured thine ear till sin entered
thy heart. Thou hast been punished in
the dispersion of thy flock, and in the loss
of thy kid, and your anxiety for it. I will
inflict on thee no other penance. The
maiden whom thou listenedst to is the
daughter of the Moor, Ben Osmin, a stern
hater of the Christian. Here is thy
gazelle
,
my son.'
`Where didst thou find my little kid,
holy father?' asked Alfonzo, as he
received
the beautiful animal from the arms
of the hermit, and pressed it to his own
bosom with grateful joy. `I knew not
that I should ever see it againand how
should I have met my sister?'
`I heard the sound of thy horn calling
together thy kids, and at the same time
the bleating of two or three before the
mouth of the cave. I rose and went forth,
wondering much at seeing them there,
when, from the direction in which I heard
your horn, I knew you were half a mile
from them to the Eastward. It surprised
me, as you are always found within sight
of your flock. Something, thought I,
unusual
has happened; and I proceeded to
drive your goats towards you. In a little
while your noble dog passed me, guiding
seven or eight more, and then I saw that
all your flock had been dispersed over the
hills. I was about to return towards the
cave, seeking any others that might have
got lost to turn them towards you, when I
heard a faint cry.'
`It was my poor gazelle!'
`It was. It was some time before I
could ascertain whence it proceeded; at
length, after considerable search, I saw it
lying at the foot of a precipice down which
it had fallen!'
`My unfortunate gazelle! this was
owing
to my folly.'
`I saw that it was in danger of being
destroyed by a young eagle that was
every few seconds wheeling around it and
then swooping towards it with grasping
talons, but scared away, yet each instant
growing bolder by the loud outcries of the
affrighted kid!'
`I shall never forgive myself, father.'
`It was a long distance round the cliff,
but I succeeded at length in descending
safely to the spot where it lay; and
scaring
away the fierce bird, I rescued it from
its perilous situation. I found no limbs
broken, but that it had been only
bewildered
by the fall.'
`It looks likely again;my poor
Zarif
!'
`It is unharmed.'
`Thanks to the Blessed Virgin!'
`No doubt that this happiness is
vouchsafed
to you in reward for your
contrition
.
I trust you will never offend in
this way again.'
`There must have been sorcery in her
voice or the words she sang, father. It
strangely affected me. It was a
sensation
wild and delightful! a sort of sweet
intoxication of the senses! I have no
doubt that it was magic.'
`Do not doubt it. The Infidel has a
league with Sathanas. The false prophet
is the great deceiver, who was to deceive
the nations. His followers have
fellowship
with Belzebub. Barbary, whence
these Moors came, is a land of sorcery
and their neighbor Egypt is the home of
magicians. It was in Egypt Moses found
sorcerers that could do even the miracles
he did, save his serpent swallowed up
their's. These Moors deal in magic, and
their very language is cabalistic. There
may have been magic in the words she
sang, for the Holy Church admits that
certain words of Arabic are unlawful to
be uttered, as they contain the alphabet
of the language spoken by fallen angels.
One can only be safe by not dealing with
the Infidel.'
Some further advice mixed with much
valuable wisdom, father Godfrey gave
the young mountaineer, and then
accompanying
him to the door of his cave, he
dismissed him with his blessing.
For several days afterwards Alfonzo
studuously and religiously avoided the
cliff on which he had listened to the
syren
song of the Moorish maiden; and
once when a straying gazelle compelled
him to go upon the cliff for it, he
carefully
abstained from looking down at the
cottage or tower. He seemed to feel
that his eyes might jeopardise his soul;
yet we cannot deny that he caught
himself
listening unconsciously, as if he
expected
the sweet sounds would be
repeated
;
and as he left the rock without
hearing
them, it must not be concealed that a
feeling of disappointment, or an emotion
very like it, passed through his bosom.
Yet when he had fairly left the rock
behind
,
he felt relieved, and experienced a
sensation of escape.
But Moorish `sorcery' was destined to
prevail over the resolutions of the young
mountaineer, if not in one way, in another.
About ten days after that on which his
sin of listening had been punished by the
dispersion of his gazelles, he was
standing
by a stately ulmos tree watching his
herd as they grazed about him, when he
heard a loud cry of alarm, followed by
fierce barking mingled with the terrific
howling of a wolf.
Quicker than lightning he grasped his
boar-spear, and bounded in the direction
of the sounds which led him into a glen
of the mountain over which the rocks
hung so closely as to exclude the sun at
noon-tide. His gazelles in the
meanwhile
warned by a blast upon his horn,
huddled together in a compact body
under
the tree, and there stood affrighted
with wild looks and expanded eyes,
trembling in every limb.
Alfonzo bounded forward and soon
came up with the combatants whom he
found in the glen closely engaged in
terrific
contest. There were two enormous
wolves battling with the dog. The pass
was very narrow, and the dog, it seemed
had been lying in it, so that when the
wolves would have passed through on
their prowling expedition to reach the
gazelles, he had been aronsed and
attacked
them at the same time giving the
alarm.
The young herdsman on seeing the
unequal
battle rushed forward shouting and
launched his spear. It passed through
the flesh of the dog's shoulder but
penetrated
at the same time beyond it the
heart of one of the wolves. The dog and
wolf fell bound together by the spear, and
Alfonzo leaped knife in hand upon the
remaining brute; but showing his teeth
with a ferocious snarl of his turned back
lips he fled. It was the work of an
instant
only for Alfonzo to draw the spear
from the neck of the dog and the heart of
the dead wolf, and thus armed to pursue
the fugitive. The dog was not disabled
by the wound, as the spear had only
transpierced the skin, and was bounding
away after him, when, at his masters's
command he returned to guard the
gazelles
.
The glen which was an opening
between
two cliffs of the Sierra, descended
obliquely down the mountain, till lost in a
vast forest to the westward. It was a
natural
road, but from the direction which
it took seemed intended only for the
convenience
of wolves and robbers. The
latter, Alfonzo well knew made frequent
use of it; and one of the strongest
positions
which he had been the means of
destroying had commanded a portion of
this defile.
There was no excitement more
congenial
to the youthful gazelle-keeper than
the wolf-chase. The animal led Alfonzo
along tle gorge for about a mile at an
unflinching
pace, occasionally snarling at
his pursuer over his back, but not
slacking
his rapid gallop. Though fleet of
foot, Alfonzo found he could not overtake
him, and he launched his spear after him,
resolved to give up the chase and return
to his flock, and also to look after the
wound in his dog's neck.
Unexpectedly to himself the spear,
well launched, glided along the ridge of
the wolf's back, and entered the back of
his head, into which it deeply forced itself,
and then fell out leaving its point broken
off in the skull. With a shout of victory
the young mountaineer bounded forward
and buried his knife in his throat as he
dropped bleeding to the ground.
CHAPTER IX.
THE FORTRESS.
The
wolf thus slain by Alfonzo was
one of the largest of his species and bore
upon his wiry hide many a scar, inflicted
by baffled hunters.
`My poor gazelles have one less
enemy
,
monster!' said the young man as he
drew his blood-wet knife from the wound
and cleaned it in the soil at his feet. He
now looked up and around him, and for
the first time discovered that he was in
the vicinity of a strong-hold once
occupied
by a party of bandits, which, under
their formidable chief
El Zegris
, he had
expelled with great loss to them, when
commanding the expedition of
Mountaineers
already alluded to. The ruin
was in sight and not a hundred yards
distant
,
and it occurred to him that the
wolves he had slain had made their den
in its foundation, and that if he searched
the place he might come upon their lair.
The idea was no sooner conceived than
he resolved to carry it into execution.
No one but Alfozo the Destroyer or
Gaspar
the Wolf-slayer would have thought
of going alone into a lonely ruin among
the wild mountains when it was likely
wolves made it their home. But danger
was the element in which the young
mountaineer breathed most freely.
He delayed only long enough to take
the skin of the wolf as a trophy of his
success, and then marched forward to the
ruin which he had not visited since he
had driven El Zegris the bandit chief
forth from it at the point of the spear,
and came near taking him captive in his
band. He found it, to his surprise,
almost
entirely repaired; the walls, which
had been partly thrown down, built up;
the gate replaced upon its massive
hinges
;
the portcullis lifted to its place, and
the draw-bridge, which had been burned,
rebuilt, though rudely, with logs. It bore
indeed every trace of having been
occupied
since the robbers had been ejected.
There was a path, too, well trodden,
leading from the gate-way down the
gorge in the direction of the dark forest
that, like an ocean of black waters,
spread many leagues in the rear of the
mountain, northwardly,
He remained standing and gazing upon
these signs of its habitation with
amazement
.
He saw at a glance that the
bandits
,
taking advantage of the quiet which
had followed the earnest war waged
against them, had returned to their
fortresses
.
His first impulse was to
conceal
his presence from any one within,
and, returning to the hamlet, gather a
party of his friends and fall upon the
place by surprise the same night. But
as he closely observed the exterior and
seeing no one either upon the look-out
above the gate or any where in the
vicinity
of the walls, curiosity impelled him
to a closer scrutiny before giving any
alarm, which in the end might have
proved
wholly unnecessary. He, therefore,
cautiously advanced step by step until he
found himself across the draw-bridge and
standing before the gate which still bore
marks of the heavy stone axes by which
he, at the head of his comrades, a few
months before, had bettered it down and
gained entrance into the strong hold.
All about the place was as silent as
the deep repose of noon could make it.
There was not a sound, save the hum of
the summer insect on wing and the
chirping
of a mountain sparrow on a branch
that overtopped the wall.
The appearance of the repairs was as
if they had been but recently made; but
yet as if they were intended to resist
outward force.
`This has been the work of not less
than a score of men,' said Alfonzo, as he
looked about upon the restored ruin; `but
where are the workmen? I will e'en
ascertain the meaning of this ere I go
away from it. The place must come
down again, and the next time level with
the ground. This gate is secured only
by bars which are put up on the outside.
This shows that those who make it
their home have gone forth barring it
behind
them. I will take the liberty of
unbarring it and go in; for I must know
who are my neighbors on the mountain.
He removed two heavy bars, or rather
timbers that were placed in deep beds in
the door-posts, and the gate swung open
of itself. Grasping his wolf-spear, and
walking guardedly, like a brave man
who means not to be taken by surprise,
he advanced into the court. This was a
quadrangle sixty feet broad, with small
rooms built into the walls on all sides
like pigeon-holes, fit dens for robbers.
On each side of the gateway were two
large rooms. The place was strewn
with the remains of old Gothic altars and
columns, it having once been a pagan
temple, according to tradition. He
entered
one of the rooms, and to his great
surprise, found that it contained the arms
and costume of Moors, while a
silver-gilt
crescent fastened upon a mace stood
up in one corner. It looked like a
Saracen
guard-house. Amazed and
wondering
what all this could mean, he
opened
the opposite room and started back on
beholding a Moorish turban and kaftan,
rolled up on the ground, and beneath the
folds of the turban peering a Moorish
beard. He looked closer and saw that
there was indeed sleeping at his feet a
Saracen soldier or robber, which, he
knew not; but he had evidence enough
that the place was occupied no longer
by Christian free-booters, but that Infidels
held it instead. But for what purpose?
This he determined to ascertain. On
looking around the apartment he saw
that it contained Moorish saddles,
scymetars
,
and yatagans, besides, turbans of
every color, kaftans, morocco slippers,
green, blue, and yellow, and many rich
dresses.
Filled with surprise at this discovery,
he was about to rouse the Moor, and
know from his lips what it meant. But
he first determined to inspect the whole
interior. He walked round the court,
looking into each of the recesses, or dens
in the wall, and although he found the
most of them vacant, he discovered
evidence
that the rest were occupied; and
one of them held two beautiful Arabian
horses, caparisoned for the field, who
started and opened their large wild eyes,
and pricked their small pointed ears in
affright, on beholding the stranger.
Having satisfied himself that the place
was occupied by a Moorish party, which
were then absent, he returned to the
room by the gate-way, where he had
seen the Infidel sentinel asleep. The
Moor was still motionless, and Alfonzo
possessing himself of his scymetar cried
aloud
`Up, Infidel! The Christians be upon
thee!'
The Saracen sprung to his feet, and
instinctively searching for his sword hilt,
found his weapon gone. Upon seeing
before him the tall athletic form of the
young mountaineer, and beholding his
scymetar held at his breast, he fell upon
his knees and cried for mercy, in broken
Spanish.
`Mercy, good Christian, mercy in the
name of Jesu!'
`Infidel dog, to dare to pronounce that
name on your polluted lips,' cried
Alfonzo
,
striking him on the mouth with
the palm of his hand. `What do you
here? Who holds this place?'
`If thou wilt spare my life, thou shalt
know all!' answered the Moor, who was
a stout man of forty, with a grizly beard,
and a swarthy visage, now pale with
terror
.
Hast thou taken the fort. Allah
guard my head then!'
`Who are you, and what do you here?'
asked Alfonzo, impatiently.
`I am Habib Ben Habib, and I was
left here to guard the fortress, but
having
drunk wine from the Captain's stores,
I fell asleep.'
`A mussulman drink wine! This is
a change in the prophet's faith. Who is
thy Captain? Answer me truly!'
`El Zegris!'
`El Zegris, again! He is a Spaniard
and thou a Moor. Besides, he has fled
men say, to the Pyrenees!'
`My Captain is El Zegris Effendi,'
answered the Saracen. `He is a
Spaniard
or a Moor as suits him. His father
was a Saracen, his mother of Andalusia.
Once he was chief of the Spanish
bandits
.
Now he is a follower of the
prophet
,
and the chief of a Saracen band.
Instead of flying to the Pyrenees when
Alfonzo, the Destroyer, defeated him,
he fled for refuge to Cordova. There
he became a good Moslem; took service
with the Emir, Abdel Alba, and became
his friend. But he gave offence to the
Emir ere long, who sent to have his
head, but El Zegris, with twenty horse,
fled the city, and sought shelter here,
repairing
the place as you see, Effendi.
I am but his poor slave, who aspired to
no higher dignity, than to make sherbet
for my master, and fight for him when I
cant run away; but I assure your
highness
I am a great coward, an arrant and
a most admirable coward, and would
not hurt a ligardo. How many fierce
Christian devils hast thou on the
outside
?'
`Enough, Moor! So thou art only a
slave of El Zegris?' said Alfonzo,
looking
upon the trembling Moor, whose beard
and moustache, with his warlike gear,
gave him a ferocious look that greatly
belied
his real character.
`No more, Effendi!' he answered with
a low obeisance.
`How is it that thou art left alone?'
`El Zegris did not expect company.
He left me because he has gone on busy
work, and needed men who could handle
steel better than I do; so he shut me in
to cook and look after the horses, and as
I told your most garcious Christian
highness
,
I was tempted and drank wine, and
the Prophet punished me by making me
drunk.'
`When did the Zegris ride forth?'
`Abut sunrise, Effendi,' answered the
slave with a profound salaam at every
word; cowardice making the craven
rogue most courteous to Alfonzo, whom,
under opposite circumstances, he would
not hesitated to have branded as a `
Christian
dog!'
`When does he return?'
`He bade me have the noon-meal
ready for him, as he should be back by
the time the sun was overhead.'
Alfonzo glanced upward, and saw that
the sun was then approaching the zenith.
He was brave, but not a bravo. His
courage was tempered with prudence.
He knew that it would be instant death to
be caught by El Zegris and his score of
followers in his stronghold. He
therefore
resolved to take his departure and
compel the Moor to go with him, as to
leave him behind would be to betray to
the robber-chief that his re-occupation of
the place was known; while, if the slave
was only missed, he might be supposed
to have run away. He was, therefore,
about to command him to go before him
and leave the place, when his ear caught
the sound of approaching horses. He
sprung to a loop-hole which commanded
the entrance, and to his confusion beheld
the Moorish party, headed by El Zegris,
winding up the gorge, and within thirty
yards of the gateway.
To escape by the gate would have been
impossible. He saw the peril he was in,
and all his self-possession was called into
exercise to aid him in effecting his escape.
The sound of the horses' hoofs clattering
over the loose stones of the rugged path
had been caught by the slave's quickear,
and the two Arabian horses neighing
briskly in their stalls showed their
consciousness
of the approach of their
companions
.
The slave, with the subtle
quickness of the Moor, was making for
the door to escape to his captain, when
Alfonzo laid his grasp upon him and held
him firmly.
`Stir not!' he cried, as he pressed the
scymetar against his breast. `Come with
me, and if you utter a word or sound this
steel shall silence your tongue forever!'
He dragged the Moor hastily along by
the collar of his kaftan, and succeeded in
gaining one of the vacant rooms which he
had before noticed had a large ruinous
loop-hole on the forest side. Into this
place he thrust the Moor headlong, and
springing in after him he closed the door
and placed against it a heavy stone
which had fallen from the wall above the
loop-hole.
He then took the turban of the slave,
and twisting it bound it firmly across his
mouth, so that he could not, even from
fear, give any alarm. He rolled him
into
the corner of the cell, and now
climbed
up to the loop-hole to see what chances
it afforded him for escaping; when, to his
deep chagrin, he saw that it overlooked
a sheer precipice of sixty feet, which
prevented
all chances of escape.
`Be it so!' said Alfonzo; `a brave man
can die but once. I will be patient and
hope, while I watch my enemy as he
enters
.'
There was an opening for air left above
each door, about the size of a brick, and
by standing upon the huge stone he had
rolled there, he was enabled to command
a view of the gate-way and of the whole
of the interior.
CHAPTER X.
THE CAPTIVE MAIDEN.
The
young mountaineer had hardly
taken his position upon the stone by the
door when El Zegris came galloping into
the court, looking round him with fierce
surprise at having found the gate
unbarred
.
`Ho, Habib Ben Habib, what means
this? Thou hast lost thy head for thy
carelessness!' he cried. `Come forth
and answer, for by the beard of the
Prophet
I will make thee a head shorter.'
As he spoke he galloped rapidly round
the court, looking in at the open doors of
the apartments; and as he passed by the
door at which Alfonzo was posted, the
corner of his vernish, or Moorish cloak,
nearly flapped into his face by the wind
of his motion.
He was splendidly mounted upon a
dun-colored Arabian mare, which had an
eye almost as beautiful and intelligent as
a woman's, a glossy hide like silk velvet,
and nostrils so transparent that the pink
light shone through them. Her head was
small and elegantly shaped, and her
fetlocks
as delicate as a deer's. Her
movements
were all fire and wild grace.
Her rider was a young man not above
thirty, rather under-sized, but firmly
made, with a finely set head, and a proud
fierce bearing. He was dressed in a
scarlet Moorish cloak, a military turban,
ornamented with the green feather of the
Caliph's guard, and loose flowing Arabian
trousers of white muslin, over which was
drawn a pair of long Tunisian green
boots. About his waist was loosely
knotted
a purple sash, to which hung by a
double gold chain a jewelled scymetar.
The trappings of his horse were also
exceedingly
rich.
His whole appearance was picturesque
and striking. His air was that of a man
accustomed to command, and wont also
to give free rein to his temper. His
features
were more Spanish than Moorish,
though his dark, handsome Arabian eye,
betrayed his half Morisco blood. His face
was very fine, full of expression, and
stamped with great energy and fierce
passions. The jet-black beard, flowing
to his breast, his raven locks sweeping
the wind, his flashing glance and martial
bearing, his inimitable horsemanship as he
sat in his Barbaric saddle, like a part of
the beautiful animal he rode, gave him
altogether an imposing appearance, and
rivetted the admiration of the youthful
gazelle-keeper; albeit Alfonzo had before
this crossed blades with him in battle, and
well nigh had taken him prisoner.
El Zegris lingered an instant at the
door of the room in which the Moorish
slave had been found by Alfonzo,
bending
forward from his saddle to peer in.
`The slave has fled! By the cross of
the Nazarene, if it prove so, he shall die
if he be taken.'
The rest of his party now came
galloping
into the court after their chief, who
had preceded them by spurring forward,
and nineteen in number rode round the
area and drew up facing the gate. They
were all Moors, save one or two renegade
Spanish bandits, whom Alfonzo
recognised
even under the turban and kaftan.
They were all habited in a fashion
similar
to that of their chief, though less rich;
the colors of their coarse kaftans being
brown or blue. Their horses, however,
were without exception beautiful animals.
Every man was armed with a short spear,
in addition to his scymetar at his girdle,
and a large two-edged knife stuck in his
boot-leg, its only sheath. They were
`bearded like pards,' and had the
ferocious
,
reckless look of outlaws, of
whatever
land or language.
There was one of the party, however,
which entered the gate, and instead of
riding round in column with the rest,
turned aside at a gesture from El Zegris,
and approached the place where he
remained
watching the entrance of his
troop. This person was a large framed
Ethiopian, whose jet-black visage
presented
a striking contrast with the white
turban
which overshadowed it.
He was, moreover, dressed in white,
save a dark colored sash, that held his
knife and heavy scymetar. He was
mounted upon a bay horse as gigantic as
himself, and, what fixed Alfonzo's eyes
with surprise and curiosity, he carried in
his arms a female figure, her face
exposed
,
and reclining upon his grisly
bearded breast. A second glance told
Alfonzo that the maiden was insensible,
and the torn veil and disarranged vesture,
shewed him that she had been lawlessly
torn away from her home, and was a
prize to El Zegris.
From the moment Alfonzo discovered
her, he had no eye for the movements
of the rest. The Ethiopian stopped his
horse in such a position, that he could
see her pale features distinctly, as she
lay unconsciously upon the hideous breast
of the Ethiop.
He had never before beheld feminine
beauty so perfect. If she were so lovely
with her color gone, and her eyes closed,
and that expression of sorrow upon her
brow, thought Alfonzo, how beautiful
must she appear when her face is lighted
up by the dazzling splendor of her eyes,
and the tint of the rose leaf plays with
the smile of beauty upon her cheek and
lip! It was impossible for him to gaze
upon a lovely girl, Moorish though he
saw she was, placed thus in the power of
lawless men, without feeling a deep
interest
awakened for her in his generous
breast. He thought of his scarcely less
beautiful sister Xariffa, and his cheek
burned as he thought how it might have
been her, instead of the sweet, hapless
stranger, on whom he gazed.
He could not remove his eyes from
her. As the Ethiop lifted up a mass of
her shining raven tresses, that had fallen
upon the neck, and mingled with the
mane of the horse, and threw them
rudely across his arm, his spirit leaped
to have the power to hurl him from the
saddle and rescue her.
`She has not yet revived!' said El
Zegris, as he laid his hand upon her
forehead, gently rather than rudely.
`No, Captain Effendi,' answered the
Ethiop, in a hoarse grating voice.
`The mountain air will soon restore
her! Dismount and bear her into that
room!' he added, pointing to an
apartment
,
the door of which was closed.
The Ethiop alighted with the graceful
form of the beautiful Moor, hanging
supine
across his arm, as if the weight
were nothing to him, and taking a key
from his bosom, he opened the door and
entered.
The apartment was evidently that
belonging
to the chief himself. The stone
pavement of the floor was covered with
richly flowered mats, and silken divans
ran round three sides of the walls, which
were hung with Venetian tapestry. Of
these particulars, Alfonzo was enabled
to obtain a glimpse, from the position in
which he was placed.
The Ethiop laid his light burden upon
one of the Divan's while the eye of his
chief followed him, and then came out
and turned the key.
`Allah be praised!' said El Zegris;
`she is now in safety, and the trouble
well off my hands of bringing her hither!'
He now turned to his men, and after
glancing from one to the other with a
rapid eye, as if numbering them, he
waved
his hand, and then dismounted
himself
.
His followers did the same also,
and each man led his horse towards the
temporary stalls in the walls of the
stronghold
.
While they were unsaddling them,
El Zegris, who had haughtily cast the
rein of his mare to the Ethiopian, was
looking round sharply for the slave. He
then examined the gate, as if to see how
he could have removed the bars from the
inner-side.
`The dog has let himself down by the
walls. That he has escaped is clear,' he
said, addressing his speech to his
lieutenant
,
a Spanish bandit, though in
Moorish costume, who approached him
after turning his horse over to one of the
men. Alfonzo knew the bandit well, he
having been once a mountaineer, and for
a murder he had done, fled to the haunts
of robbers for protection.
`The rogue fears your scymetar and
his wind-pipe will some day become
acquainted
;
he knows that he well deserves
that such an introduction should take
place,' was the reply of the lieutenant,
with a coarse laugh. `He has escaped
without doubt. I am sorry, for we have
no coffee ready, and we are pretty well
tired with our foray down the mountain!'
`The maid seems to take her capture
unkindly.'
`Make the maiden no theme for thy
speech, Diego!' said El Zegris, with a
flashing eye, as he turned away and
walked towards the room, where he had
ordered the Ethiopian to place her. He
turned the key and entered, leaving the
door wide open.
The maiden lay upon the divan, like
a reclining statue of marble. Alfonzo,
whose look out was not more than twelve
feet from the apartment where she was,
saw him place his hand upon her pulse,
and shake his head.
`This sleep will end in death if I let it
go on. I must bleed her!' he cried, and
taking a lancet from his sash, which
was contained in a morocco case that
held a few other small surgical
instruments
and mendicaments, such as men
accustomed to war always carried about
with them in those days, he bared her
moulded arm, and bandaging it with her
torn veil, pierced the full vein. In a
few moments, as the blood flowed into a
silver basin, held by the huge Ethiopian
on one knee at his feet, she opened her
eyes, and a shudder passed over her
frame, while a faint flush colored her
cheek, and deepened the red upon her
lips.
`She revives,' cried El Zegris.
His voice, and the sight of him
bending
over her, drew from her a cry of
terror. She realized at once the
circumstances
of her situation, and bounding to
her feet, she shrieked and would have
fled. But her strength failed her ere she
had made three steps, and she would
have fallen heavily to the floor, but for
the interposing arm of the robber-chief.
`Nay, be calm, child,' said El Zegris,
smiling with the consciousness of
possession
.
`Thy father insulted, me and so,
by Allah, did the daughter. Thou shalt
be the bride of El Zegris. Thou'
`Nevernever!' she cried, putting
her hands before her face, with the palms
open towards him, and shuddering with
horror. `I will not listen to thee. Thou
hast ruthlessly torn me from my home,
as if I were a Christian slave, rathar than
a free Moslem woman.'
`Thou art more beautiful, fairest
Genilla
,'
said the chief, `than all the
maidens
in Christendom else. Be gentle, and
be the bride of El Zegris.'
`Robber.'
`I am now an outlaw; but ere long
I shall be an Emir. There is discord at
work in Cordova, and El Zegris will be
there when the nut is ripe to see what he
can do with raising a standard.
Andalusia
is now the prize of the sharpest
scymetar. Come, Genilla, say thou will be
mine.'
`My spirit shall take flight to Allah,
ere it bow to thy will,' answered the
young girl with lofty resolution.
`I will tame thee.'
`Do not drive me to death, chief, What
is my dead body to thee? Yet I swear
to thee by the Holy pages of the Koran
that I will not be thine, and live.'
`Dost thou not know, sweet maid, that
thou art in my power. I offer thee the
honorable place of wife. Thou refusest
it, knowing that thou art wholly mine,
and that I do thee an honor. No, no; I
cannot give thee up. It has cost me too
much trouble to possess myself of thee.
Thou mayest play at disdain, flash thine
eye, and curl thy pretty lip, but it will
avail thee nothing. I am no longer a
wooer to sue for thy smile, but thy
master
to command.'
`More and more, as thy speech unfolds
thy nature, do I hate thee. Each word
thou utterest but widens the space
between
us.'
`Sayest thou so,' answered the chief,
turning pale with anger, and a bright
angry
light glowing in his eyes. I will find
a way to tame thee. I will leave thee
now a while; but first I will take good
care that you have no instrument of
death; for I do half believe you would
try and cheat me out of yourself, if you
believed there was no way of escape for
you. But as to escape, you can easily
see that you have no chance to get free.
You are a prisoner in a stronghold in the
mountains, a full league and a half from
your father's cottage. I leave thee now
to better reflections, and Allah be praised
whether they favor me or no, thou art
mine
nevertheless.'
CHAPTER XI.
EL ZEGRIS.
It
was with the most intense interest,
and the deepest sympathy in the fate of
the hapless maiden, Moorish though she
were, that Alfonzo witnessed what we
have related in the foregoing chapter.
His heart swelled with indignant
emotion
,
and his cheek burned at the
contemplation
of her unprotected state. His
reverence and love for his sister had made
all other maidens sacred in his sight. She
was, too, about Xariffa's age, and had the
same dark beaming eyes, and flowing
dark hair.
He watched the robber chief as he
left the apartment, locking behind him
the door, and placing the key in his
girdle
.
He resolved then that he would
endeavor
,
in securing his own escape, to
effect
hers also, if it were possible. The
beauty and hapless condition of the
beautiful
Moorish girl, had made their own
impression upon his heart; but certain
tones of her voice, as she plead
eloquently
for liberty at the feet of El Zegris,
made him believe that he saw captive
before his eyes the maiden who had so
captivated his senses with her song.
The very idea should have made the
youth tremble when he recollected the
consequences which had followed his
listening
to her melody. But this was not
the effect this assurance produced in his
bosom; but it rather increased and gave
rest to his awakened interest in her. Like
the moth, he would hover around the
flame which had singed him. There
was an infatuation in the feeling that
possessed
him.
But it was easier to yield to the
infatuation
than to resist it. As a mere
Moorish
maiden taken captive it is a question
whether Alfonzo, chivalrous as he was
by nature, would have gone so far as he
did towards effecting her release; but
when that maiden was the sweet
songstress
the echo of whose voice still float
ed about his heart, he was inspired by a
romantic enthusiasm in her behalf the
secret of which lay in a sentiment deep
in his bosom which he had never yet
analysed, but to which he yielded
obedience
.
The very reason which father
Godfrey would have urged to him why
he should leave the fair captive to her
fate, was the very reason which
prompted
him to resolve to accomplish her
release
.
Conscience and his religion told
him to banish her from his thoughts and
think only of himself, whose peril was
equal to her own; while a tender interest
that lay deeper than mere waywardness,
urged him to desire to see her free from
the power of El Zegris.
`I will escape only with that maiden
by my side,' he said, resolutely. `It
may be wrong to serve one whom
conscience
bids me fly, but I cannot resist
the impulse. It may be that a spell is
upon me, and that this kindness towards
her that warms my bosom is produced
by Moorish enchantments that I may be
induced to free her. However it be I
shall obey the feeling. I could not feel
myself free to go forth and leave the
poor beautiful tearful maiden behind me.
If I escape she escapes also with me, if
she will accept freedom at the hand of a
Christian. This El Zegris shall be
disappointed
.
He shall lose his bride and
he shall know that Alfonzo the Destroyer
has stolen her from his hand.'
He now watched the progress of things
in the court. The Moorish horsemen,
after having taken care of their steeds,
gathered about a large fire which one of
their number built in the midst of the
court, and began each to cook for
himself
the dinner which the unlucky Habib
Ben Habib should have had in readiness.
A kid, stolen from some herd on the
mountain, was roasted upon sticks, and
with their knives they cut off pieces and
devoured them with coarse barley bread,
washing the whole down with sour wine,
which was sipped in an old silver cup
out of a copper vessel near by.
El Zegris and his lieutenant Diego ate
apart on a broad seat placed just within
the door of the room which contained the
arms of the party, the apartment which
Alfonzo had first entered on coming into
the fortress.
All their proceedings were plainly
visible
to Alfonzo. He noted everything
with the closest attention. In the
meanwhile
,
Ben Habib, his prisoner, was
becoming
very restless, rolling about and
blowing noisely for breath. He saw that
it was necessary to silence him and
getting
down from the stone he placed his
hands upon the now motionless slave as
he lay against a broken pillar curiously
carved with a capital of entwined asps
and said sternly,
`If you are not still you shall die.
You have heard what El Zegris has
said. If he hears you and discovers you
and me he will be sure to take your head
off as well as mine.'
`I know it, Effendi,' gasped the Moor,
succeeding in removing the turban from
his mouth. `Oh, do not let me die for
want o' breath. I have small nostrils, as
Allah knows, and I can't get wind enough
in and out at them for my body! If
thou wilt let me breathe and trust to me,
may the Prophet pull me out o' Paradise
by the hairs o' my beard if I speak above
my breath. I know well I am taller by
the head while I am in here than I should
be out there.'
Alfonzo reflected a moment. He
was convinced that he could safely trust
him, as he saw that he was fully
convinced
his safety depended on being
undiscovered
.
`I will trust you, Ben Habib. But I
swear to you by your Prophet that if you
lift your voice above a whisper, or speak
when you are not spoken to, I will slay
you on the spot.'
With these words Alfonzo unbound
the turban from his mouth and returned
it to him to fold again about his shining
bald pate. Ben Habib was full of
gratitude
and kissing the hem of Alfonzo's
robe, said he would be his slave and serve
him faithfully if he would deliver him
out of the hands of the fierce El Zegris.
The Moor seemed to think that the
young mountaineer, alone and
surrounded
by foes as he was, would yet escape
his enemies in safety; and Alfonzo too
possessed this very kind of confidence in
himself. The idea of being taken
prisoner
or slain by El Zegris did not give
him a moment's uneasy thought. He
felt strong in his own courage and energy.
He now returned once more to his
look-out, while Ben Habib climbed up to
the loop-hole to survey the depth below.
He measured it with his eye, and looked
by no means satisfied at the result of the
survey. He neverthless slid down again
to the floor, and began to unwind his
kaftan
,
and proceeded to tear it into pieces.
At the noise, Alfonzo called to know what
he was doing.
`I am making a rope to let myself
down the wall, Effendi. My sash and
turban, my kaftan and trousers, torn up
with economy, will reach full fifty feet,
and a jump of ten more may be saved if
thou wilt lend thy bernash to me to tear
up!'
`Hist! Let this be the last way of
escape when all others fail,' said Alfonzo.
`I would try this first. El Zegris may
take a notion to have all the empty rooms
looked into after me; and if he finds this
door fast on the inside, it is all up with
thee and mewhip would go off our
heads in the stoning of a date.'
`Make no more noise with that
rending
,
and be silent. I will devise a way
to get out of this. Worse come to the
worst we can fight our way out.'
`Allah forfend, good neighbor Effendi.
I am no man at the swordI am better
at a spit. Let us have no fighting, I pray
thee!'
`Silence, Moor!' cried Alfonzo sternly.
He then directed his scrutiny into the
court with the closest attention. The
Moors, having dined, had thrown
themselves
upon their mats and horse-cloths,
to sleep in the shade, and repose after
the fatigue of their morning's expedition.
In a little while all, except two, who were
still drinking wine by the fire, were
stretched at length in sleep. El Zegris
and his lieutenant still remained eating
dried dates, waited upon by the
Ethiopian
.
At length El Zegris rose and
walked
slowly round the court-yard, gazed a
moment on the sleepers, glanced into the
stalls, examined the security of the gate,
and then ordered the two men by the fire
to take their scymetars and do guard duty.
The men murmured at being compelled
to leave their sour wine, but obeyed.
The lieutenant Diego, without more ado,
threw himself at length on the divan upon
which he had taken his dinner, and
shading
his face with his turban, was soon
buried in deep rose.
El Zegris alone, with the two sentinels,
was awake and vigilant. For his men to
sleep after dinner was as customary, in
that climate, as to sleep in the night.
They were, moreover, better fitted by
repose
in the heat of noon for the midnight
expeditions upon which El Zegris led
them.
At length, after walking round the
court and observing every thing
thoroughly
,
like a skilful chief, he stopped before
the door of the apartment in which the
maiden had been shut up. Alfonzo's
heart throbbed violently, and his grasp
was firmer upon the hilt of Ben Habib's
scymetar, which he held in his hand.
The Ethiopian came near him, and held
up before his eyes the bloody wolf-spear
which Alfonzo had dropped as he hurried
from the guard-room with his hold upon
the Moor's collar. The Ethiopian had
just found it in the corner whither it had
rolled aside, unheeded by its owner, who
did not miss it with the scymetar in his
grasp. He now saw it again with
surprise
,
aud closely observed the result of
the discovery.
`What is it?' impatiently asked El
Zegris, whose foot was already on the
step of the door which led to the
apartment
of his beautiful captive.
`A mountaineer's wolf-spear. It has
blood on it still moist.'
`How came you by it?' asked El
Zegris
,
taking it in his hand and looking at
it closely.
`I found it just now in that room, upon
the floor. No doubt it will help to
account
for Ben Habib's absence, and the
open gate.'
`By the beard of Mahomet, you say
well, Yussuf. This is strange! Is it a
man's blood on it?'
`No, a wolf's.'
`How can you tell?'
`Man's blood dries red: a brute's
darkens
and becomes brown: this is brown.'
`It is not the slave's blood then! But
how came this spear here?'
`It must have been left here.'
`But by whom? If this place had been
visited by a herdsman, as it is not likely,
for they seldom venture this side o' the
Sierra, it would have been plundered.
Nothing seems gooe. Yet the gate was
found open and this spear picked up;
and Ben Habib is no where to be found.
I will examine this matter by and by.
Guards, see that you keep vigilant watch,
and on no account open the gate. We
have enemies that have found us out.
Yussuf, keep awake, and if anything
occurs
to cause alarm, sound the trumpet
call.'
With these words El Zegris threw
open the door of the apartment in which
the maiden had been imprisoned, and as
he entered, she darted past him with a
bound and a cry of mingled defiance and
terror. He caught her around the waist
and detained her, with a laugh of
victory
.
`No, no, my pretty bird. You do not
escape so easily. Do not be so cruel as
to fly me thus. There is many a maiden
that would gladly become the bride of
El Zegris, yet I choose only thee.'
`I would thank thee to put me to
death,' she cried imploringly. `I hate
thee, Julio.'
`Not half so much as I love thee.'
`Give me till to-morrow to decide,'
she cried ia despair.
`I see the ruse. Thou wishest to gain
time. But I will not be too hard with
thee. I will give thee till the sun go
down. Wilt thou decide by then?'
`I will,' she answered, half suffocated
with her emotions. `Leave me now. I
had hoped thou hadst relented. But
leave me now.'
`I had also hoped that thou hadst
relented
.
Say that thou wilt be my bride,
Genilla, star of my life, and I will ride
with thee to-morrow, in open day, into
Cordova, and at the Mosque there the
Mufti shall wed thee to me.'
`It is false what thou utterest. Thou
darest not appear in Cordova for thy
head, robber. But at sun-down thou
shalt have my answer. Leave me.'
`Cruel as beautiful, thou seest that I
am thy slave and obey thee,' he
answered
with an air of haughty
superciliousness
,
while a scornful smile curved his
dark lip.
He then slowly withdrew and turned
the key as before, saying significantly as
he did so, `At sunset.'
CHAPTER XII.
THE ENTERPRIZE PLANNED.
The
youthful gazelle-keeper now in
his heart resolved that he would free the
maiden from the power of El Zegris,
even at the sacrifice of his life. There
were, perhaps, two motives operating to
spur him on to this chivalrous enterprise;
one, and the most powerful, a deep
interest
in the sweet singer who had so
enthralled
his heart, and the other, a
desire
to disappoint the robber chief.
Touehing his own escape, he saw that
it could be effected by the mode which
had been suggested by Ben Habib; for
he well knew that the robes of both, torn
up into cords, would be of sufficient
length and strength to let him and the
Moor down the precipice, when their
escape
would be easy by the defile of the
mountain.
But Alfonzo was not one who could at
any time think only of self-preservation,
and more particularly now, when he was
to leave behind, in the power of El
Zegris
,
a lovely girl, who had not been out
of his thoughts for a day in the past three
weeks, and whose voice floated like
strains of music from the walls of
Paradise
,
through his dreams night after
night.
`I will not seek my own safety and
leave the maiden in the power of El
Zegris
,'
he said firmly, as Ben Habib once
more ventured to propose to him to
escape
by the window.
`How can you do her any good,
Effendi
?'
asked Ben Habib in astonishment.
`There is El Zegris my master and
twenty men that fear neither man nor
spirit of evil. They will cut thee in
pieces and make kabobs of thee and me.
Let me tear up my kaftan. We had
best be diligent and get away while they
sleep!'
El Zegris is not asleep. He is
standing
by the door of the armoury.'
`He will lay down by and bye. He
always takes his sleep after noon.'
`No. He walks away and now gives
an order to the Ethiopian. The black
leaves his side and crosses to the stalls
He is saddling the chief's horse. Now
he puts the saddle on his own.'
`El Zegris is going to ride out, I dare
say, in search of me, Effendi;' answered
Ben Habib, with tremor in every limb.
`Rather to ascertain if any enemy is
lurking about; for he is examining my
wolf-spear with attention, and evidently
is disturbed at its being found here. He
goes out to see if there are any signs of
his enemies abroad.'
`That is it. He will examine the
ground closely for footsteps of man or
horse. I am grateful to Allah I am safe
in here.'
`The sentry is unfastening the gate,
tho' not before looking through a loop-hole
over it to see that all is clear on the
outside
of the walls. The Ethiopian now
leads the two horses across the court
towards
his master. El Zegris vaults into
his saddle fully armed, and bears in his
hand my wolf-spear. He evidently means
to see if he can find anybody, man or
wolf; in the neighborhood to account for
the blood on the spear.
`It will be more of a puzzle for him to
tell how the spear came here, Effendi,'
answered Ben Habib with a faint attempt
at a smile. `I hope he will get his neck
broke before he comes back again. Now
his going out will keep us in. If we get
down the rock, and into the defile he will
find me, and then, Mash-Allah, Ben
Habib
will have no more use for a turban.'
`Hist! he speaks with the Ethiopian,
and points towards the door of the room
where his prisoner is shut up, and then
casts a glance of suspicion towards his
lieutenant Diego.'
`He is afraid to leave the fortress, and
leave her to the power of the renegade.
By the soul of the Prophet, he is right,'
said Ben Habib, who stood near Alfozo,
and listened with great interest to his
reports
of what passed without in the
court-yard
of the strong-hold.
`It is plain that he fears him. The
Ethiopian makes a salaam with his face
to the ground, and goes towards the
door where he sits leaning his head against
the pillar, and with his naked scymetar
grasped in his right hand. Te enter the
place one would first have to encounter
the gigantic barbarian.'
`I have seen him, Effendi,' said Ben
Habib, `I have seen him take up two
stout Moors, one in each hand, and dash
their heads together three feet from the
ground, till they roared for mercy.'
`El Zegris waves his hand to one of
the sentries to mount the Ethiop's horse.
He obeys, and the chief rides forth,
followed
closely by him. The gate is shut,
but not barred, for I heard El Zegris say
that it must be left so as to admit him
suddenly, in case he should be
compelled
to to return suddenly.'
`I hear the clatter of the horses' hoofs
as they go over the draw-bridge. Allah
be praised; may they never come back
again. Now, Effendi, what shall we do?
If we go out of the loop-hole, as I
proposed
,
El Zegris, whose eye is like an
eagle's, will be sure to see us, and I
should land upon his pike-head, spitted
like a goose.
`Be patient, and I will devise a way of
escape for us both and the lady also,'
answered
Alfonzo.
`Do not think of the woman, Effendi.
Women are made to do men mischief.
Every evil in the world hath come o'
woman. If it had not been for a woman,
El Zegris would not have left here after
one, and I should not have been left alone,
and captured by you and locked up here
and in danger of my head.'
`If it had not been for a woman you
would never have been born, Ben Habib,
so let the matter end there.'
`Mash Allah; that is but the beginning
of it,' answered the Moor, pulling his
beard and shrugging his shoulders. `Now
Effendi, if thou wilt tell me how I am to
get out of this, I will pray Allah for thy
soul's safety when it crosses the bridge
of a single hair that leads to Paradise.'
`Silence, Ben Habib. They babble
will awake these robbers, and they will
have thee by thy beard ere thou knowest it.
`Bismillah! I shall know it when they
do; the curse of the Prophet light upon
them.'
Alfonzo having seen the chief and his
single follower ride forth, and the gate
closed, but not fastened, and having seen
the Ethiopian seat himself by the door,
as a guardian Cerebus of the impassioned
maiden, began to conceive in his mind
some way in which he could avail
himself
of the present condition of things, to
effect not only his own escape, but the
liberation of the maiden.
The whole interior of the court-yard,
with its numerous little rooms, or cells in
the wall opening into it, with its groups
of Moors reposing in different parts of it,
under the shadows of the western side,
with the embers of the late fire in the
centre, was open to his gaze. The
Moorish sentry at the gate had seated
himself upon a stone; Diego, the
lieutenant
,
was asleep on the divan under the
eaves of the guard-room, and the Ethiop
leaned upon his scymetar, looking
dozingly
over the sleeping men, and
occasionally
nodding his head over the hilt of his
weapon.
Alfonzo watched his motions until, at
length, he had the satisfaction of seeing
him droop his huge head upon his
shoulder
,
and remain motionless in the
profoundest
repose. The only person that
seemed to be awake under the drowsy
influence of that warm sunny afternoon,
was the sentry at the gate. The horses
in their stalls, by their stamping, and
occasionally
neighing, alone broke the
profound
stillness, which, like the repose of
midnight, reigned within the fortress.
Alfonzo now saw that the time had
come for him to effect his escape, if he
ever intended to leave the den of
robbers
alive. He was impatient to go, for
he thought of his poor, watchful dog, his
defenceless flock, his anxious sister and
father. Every moment was precious to
him. El Zegris might not be out long,
and the attempt, if made at all, must be
made, he saw, at once.
`Ben Habib,' he said, turning to the
Moor, give me thy turban. Fold it on
my head as thou wearest it, and thy
people!'
The Moor obeyed in silent admiration.
`Now thy kaftan. I want thy Moorish
trowsers also! Not a word. Invest me
with all thy apparel; for I am to play
the Infidel for a little while.'
`By the Prophet's beard, wilt thou
leave thy servant as naked as he was
born, Effendi?'
`No, thon shalt have a fair exchange.
Put on my clothes!'
`This will be turning a Moslem into a
Christian, as well as a Christian into a
Moselm.'
`Not a word of objection. I am to
effect thy escape, as well as my own.'
`I shall be taken and slain as a
Christian
dog.'
`Thou hadst better be slain as a
Christian
thanas thou art sure to be if I leave
the hereas a Moslem dog.'
`Thou speakest wisdom! Now thou
art a Moslem to any man's eye. By the
beards of Islam, thou wouldst be taken
by the Prophet himself for one of his own
followers.'
`I am willing to be for the present.
Now I wish to have thee second me, and
obey me in every thing, if thou lovest thy
life.'
`I love it better than I do any thing
else I know of in this miserable world,
the curse of Allah be upon it, that ever
I was born into it, to be now in danger of
losing my head. Look at me! Am I
not a Christian without suspicion of ever
having seen the inside of a Mosque.
BismillahitAllah! I am like to loose
my head either as a Christian or
Moslem
.
I will stick close to thy skirts,
Effendi
.'
`Thou must fight too, if need be.
Remember that thy life hangs upon thy
valor,'
`Then I fear me my neck will hang
by a rope also. I am better at spitting
fowl than men, Effendi.'
`I am now about to open the door, and
go boldly out. I shall, if noticed, by the
sentinel or any who may awake, be taken
for one of their number, as I shall keep
my turban thus well over my brow.
My first step will be to go to the stalls,
and saddle three of the best steeds.'
`Then what wilt thou do?'
`I will make thee come out of this
hiding-place, and hold them ready to
mount!'
`Bismillah! They will not take me
for one of their followers. Canst thou
not, while thou art about it, bring a
turban
and kaftan, and trowsers from the
guard-room there. I will put them on in
a second, noble Effendi.'
`I will try if I can, without
awakening
Diego, who sleeps there. But if I
cannot you must obey me, nevertheless,
and hold the horses. No one will
observe
,
for the sentinel is yielding to the
general influence, and is bobbing his
head to and fro, as if it was balanced on
wires.'
`I must obey, Effendi. I will do my
best,' answer Ben Habib, in a
desponding
tone.
`Thou hast no alternative, but to
remain
here, then, and await thy fate from
the scymetar of El Zegris when he
returns
;
for he will assuredly take off thy
head for thy carelessness in letting me
in. Now, watch my movements, and
when thou seest me cross the court after
saddling the horses, you sally forth
noiselessly
and take them, and lead them
after me. It shall not be my fault if there
are not three riders upon their saddles in
a moment after scouring across the
draw-bridge
.'
Alfonzo now cast one more observing
glance over the sleeping court-yard, and
then rolled the stone back from the door,
and slowly opened it. He stepped forth,
his scymetar in his hand, and habited
from head to foot like a Moor. He
closed the door behind him, leaving Ben
Habib peering through a narrow crevice,
his face pale with fear, and his large
eyes expanded with expectation. His
prayers to Allah went with him for his
success, for upon it depended his own
safety. It was, therefore, with the
deepest interest, that he followed his
movements.
Alfonzo, after finding himself fairly
in the open court-yard, proceeded
towards
the stalls. He found, to his great
joy, two horses saddled, the same which
had been found there by him, when he
entered the fort. All he had to do, was
to tighten their girths, and bit them. He
threw a saddle upon a third horse, and
then leading the three out, he beckoned
to Ben Habib. But he had to make the
signal thrice, before the Moor came forth
with a face blanched by terror, increased
by his Christian costume. But Alfonzo
saw that the risk would be too great for
him to try to pass into the armoury, by
the sleeping lieutenant.
`Now lead these horses, and hold them
before you door for me,' said Alfonzo,
as he left him and walked round in the
shadows of the court, towards the
guarded
door of the apartment which
contained
the beautiful Moor.
CHAPTER XIII.
THE RESCUE.
The
critical moment for action, upon
which his own life as well as the
happiness
and safety of the Moorish maiden
depended, had now arrived, and the young
gazelle-keeper felt the need of all his
coolness, as well as of his courage.
Slowly he advanced towards the door,
on the threshold of which the Ethiop
reclined
a
giant in stature and strength
his head bowed upon his breast, and
buried in profound sleep. The Moorish
sentinel at the gate raised his eyes as
Alfonzo
approached the Ethiopian, but
merely towards him: he closed them
again. Alfonzo saw in this act proof of
the perfection of his disguise; for the
sentry had evidently taken him for one
of the Moors walking about in preference
to sleeping.
Taking a firmer grasp upon the hilt of
the scymetar, Alfonzo now strode
rapidly
forward, and, passing by the
Ethiopian
,
came suddenly upon the sentinel,
whom he caught by the beard and, at a
single blow with his scymetar, sent the
Moor to his Propnet. It was the act of
an instant. The victim of necessity
uttered
no groan, but fell dead across the
stone upon which he was seated.
Alfonzo
with a strong arm then swung back
the heavy gates, and leaving them wide
open, he bounded lightly towards the
Ethiopian, and leaping upon the giant
buried his steel deep into his breast. The
African rose convulsively to his full
height, tossed his arms wildly in the air
above his head, and then pitched
headlong
forward, at the foot of one of the
circular, serpent-entwined barbaric altars
in the fortress, and struck upon the ground
with a sound that made the court-yard
ring again, and to vibrate with the shock,
while Alfonzo springing upon him once
more struck him to ensure his death.
Instantly three or four Moors were
awake and upon their feet.
`The horses, Ben Habib!' cried
Alfonzo
.
`This way quickly. Rescue,
lady! rescue!' he called to the maiden.
`I have slain your guard, and now will
open the door for thy escape!'
With this he took the massive
scymetar
of the Ethiopian, and wielding the
ponderous weapon as he would have done
a battle-axe, he broke the door down and
sprung across it into the apartment. There
stood the Moorish maiden with eager face,
her hands clasped, and her head bent
forward
between fear and wonder and hope.
`Ask no questions, lady! Know that
I am the foe of El Zegris, and risk my
life to save thee. Wilt thou commit
thyself
to my guidance!
`Yes, oh yes!' she cried, yet
shrinking
instinctively from the presence of a
stranger. But there was something in
the tones of his voice, more than in his
words, that gave her confidence, and
assured
her that she was not flying from
one enemy into the power of another.
`I go with youonly save me from El
Zegris!' she added, grasping his hand.
`Then mount with me upon one of
these horses. The way is open before
us. Delay not a moment, the Moors are
arising.'
With these words he caught her up,
and the next moment was seated in the
saddle with her in his arms. There was
no time to place her upon the other horse.
Ben Habib no sooner beheld him
mounted
,
than springing forward he dashed first
out of the gate, and just in time cleared
the portal to avoid a blow of a yataghan
from one of the Moors, who had
bounded
forward to stop his progress. Alfonzo
was met by three of them in his passage
to the gate; but with the heavy scymetar
of the Ethiopian he cut two of them down
and rode over the third. He turned his
head for a second and shouted back,
`Tell the Zegris that Alfonzo the
Destroyer
has taken his bride away.' The
next moment he was threading across the
bridge, leaving confusion, alarm and
amazement behind him in the fortress.
The Moors were now all awake, and
seizing their arms before he got across
the moat, ran to the walls, and a score
of spears and lances were sent after him,
but fell harmlessly about his path, as he
flew like the windbut still outstripped
by Ben Habib, who went down the rocky
pass as if he had neither neck or head to
break.
The astonished Moors finding their
sentinel
dead, the Ethiopian slain, and
seeing
the surprising escape of what
seemed
to them a Christian and a Moslem
mounted upon two of their best horses,
the latter carrying on his saddle bow the
Moorish captive, knew not what to say,
or how to understand it all. But when
they heard his defying cry which told who
he was, fear seized them. They
increased
their confusion by asking a hundred
questions of one another, which none
could answer. They believed they were
surrounded by mountaineers. Diego soon
recovered his presence of mind, and
seeing
no other enemies, ordered the whole
party into the saddle to pursue the
fugitives
,
whoever they were. But they
refused
to stir to a man, without El Zegris.
The daring act they had witnessed, with
the dread name which had been shouted
back to their ears, paralyzed them.
The third horse still galloped by the
side of Alfonzo, held fast by the rein, and
when he got to the foot of the defile, he
transferred the maiden to the saddle upon
it, and thus side by side they flew down
the mountain. Not a word was spoken
by either. Flightsafetywere only
in the minds of both. Ahead of them
rode at an unflinching pace the
affrighted
Ben Habib, laying on with fist and
heels, and glowing, as if pursued by
wolves. From the heights above, the
Moor sent cries of defiance, and lances
that fell short; but none came forth to
pursue. Not even Diego crossed the
portal, but believing that the
mountaineers
were in force near by, and that he
would fall into an ambuscade, he ordered
the gates to be closed, and the garrison
to stand at arms ready to repel the
expected
assault; for that the person who
had entered the fort and carried off the
maiden, slaying the sentry and the
Ethiopian
,
must have been backed by a large
force, he felt confident. He was
anxious
,
too, for the safety of El Zegris,
whom one of the Moors said he
recollectas
he was going to sleep, having seen
ride forth accompanied by Ali Benish his
trumpeter.
`This is all a strange work,' ejaculated
Diego, as he gazed upon the bodies of
the two men. `One cant well say what
is done when one is asleep; but things,
look as if the devil had been paying us a
visit. How that man who rode forth
with the maiden on his saddle ever got
inside I know not. Yet as he rode out
he must have rode in.'
`He was mounted on the captain's
dun mare, that he keeps for holidays,'
said one of the Moors.
`So I thought I had seen the horse
before
;
but he rode on like the wind. And
that was one of ours that he led too, I
suppose
.'
`It belongs to Aben Hafel.'
`Yet it was not Alfonzo the Destroyer
who had the maiden. He, whoever he
was, was a Moor. The person who rode
ahead alone was the young mountaineer
chief.'
`If ever there were two heads made
on the same block,' said one of the
Moorish robbers, `the head on that man's
shoulders was as like that of Ben Osmin
as two eyes under one brow. I made a
stroke at him, believing him to be a
Christian dog, as he rode out, and he
drew up his eyes and uttered a yell that
none but the gullet of Ben Osmin could
have given voice to. Besides, I knew the
board and the bottle-nose.'
`Then who in the name of St. Peter of
Rome was the turbaned fellow who rode
so gallantly, and shouted back the name
of Alfonzo?' asked Diego.
`It was the Christian himself,' said
another of the renegade Spanish robbers
who stood by. `I saw him when he
defeated
our captain, and heard his voice
resounding above the fight. It was the
same voice. He spoke for himself and
not for the one in the Christian garb,
who rode ahead.'
`Then I have it,' said Diego, as the
riddle
seemed to resolve itself slowly to his
apprehension. `This Alfonzo has met
Ben Huzzar, who you know we found
not when we returned, he has met him
outside and, changing garbs with him,
has, by his means, through his treachery
or his fears, got entrance into the fort
while we slept, slew the sentinel and the
Ethiopian, and so carried off the maiden
bodily. This is all the explanation I can
give for it, especially as, El Melec here
says that he heard El Zegris when he went
out order the sentinel to leave the gate
ajar for his return. This must be the
truth. But more than this, Alfonzo
would never have ventured inside a
fortress
in broad day.
When El Zegris returns he will foam
and chafe life a tiger to find his mistress
stolen and we all asleep the while. But
as we are all alike to blame, he will have
to take all our heads if any; so the very
magnitude of the offence will be our
safety. I care not for the loss of the
maiden, nor for that matter will any of
us weep for the death of this mass of
Ethiopian bone and flesh. I will let
them lay where they are till El Zegris
returns, and in the meanwhile will keep
our defences in case that this daring
mountaineer should have a force at hand,
as is likely. If El Zegris be not
watchful
,
he will be in danger! I wonder what
sent him abroad. Hark! there is a shout.
There clangs steel against steel in the
defile below! To horse! There is a
combat! El Zegris is no doubt in peril.
Who will follow me?'
Four of the Moors leaped into their
saddles at the same instant that he did.
The gates were thrown open, and like a
whirlwind the party dashed across the
moat and soon diappeared to the eyes of
those who watched them from the walls.
El Zegris had left the fortress for the
purpose of satisfying himself touching
the wolf-spear, which had been found in
the interior of his stronghold. The
blood upon it he believed to be either that
of Ben Habib or of a wolf, slain near the
fort; but he suspected it to be the blood
of the former, who had been slain by
the owner of the spear, and his body cast
over the cliff.
He, therefore, after getting down the
path to the foot of the rock on which the
tower stood, rode round the base of it,
looking for the body of his slave. But
nothing appeared to confirm his
suspicions
.
He carefully, also, watched the
neighborhood, which was a wild scene of
rocks overthrown, tangled forest and
barren pinnacles that towered like
minerets
,
seeming to invite the crescent to
crown their sharp points. He rode,
scymitar
in hand, like a man who expects an
enemy to start out from behind every
covert. After riding quite around the
elevated spur of the peak on which his
stronghold was perched, without finding
the body of his slave, he turned into the
gorge which led over the shoulder of the
mountain in the direction of the hamlet
on the southern side. He dismounted in
this path, and giving his reign to his
follower
,
he carefully walked along,
examining
the ground and the stones, and
even noticing the spears and grass to
ascertain
if a foot-step either of man or
horse had recentiy disturbed it. He had
not proceeded far before he saw a small
pebble that had been brushed from its bed
in the soil, its moist side being turned
upward
and the little clayey cavity in which
it had been half imbedded, was still damp
and smooth, not being even sun-dried.
This was a proof to him that some one
had been in the path not long before.
He continued his search and a little ways
further came upon the print of a foot.
He saw that it was not a Moorish
sharp-pointed
boot, but the broad sandal track
of a mountaineer.
`I have now evidence enough that
some Christian dog has found his way
into the fort in my absence, and that the
spear belongs to the owner of the foot
that pressed its print into the soil here!'
While he was examining the ground
farther, his followers, who had gone
forward
a few paces, leading his horse,
suddenly
cried out that the horses would not
move, and that they acted as if a wolf
was near. Upon looking up, El Zegris
saw the animals running backwards,
moving their ears and snorting with
alarm. He immediately sprung into his
saddle, and levelling his spear, rode for
ward, urging his reluctant steed with its
sharp point. He had proceeded but a
few steps when his horse reared and
nearly threw him, and wheeling about
would have galloped away. Directly in
the path lay a dead wolf, and a vulture
was balancing himself on his large dark
wings above its head, fiercely picking
out its eye. A shout from the chief sent
him soaring away to settle slowly upon
the top of a scathed oak. El Zegris,
unable
to get his horse nigher, leaped to
the ground and approached the wolf,
which he found had been recently slain
by a spear thrust, from which the blood
still oozed out upon the earth.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE PURSUIT.
The
sight of the dead wolf, with the
spear-wound in his head, was hardly
needed to confirm the suspicions of El
Zegris that some mountaineer had been
his visitor, and that the person who slew
the wild animal and he who entered the
fortress were the same he was convinced
by finding the broken point of the spear
he held in his hand sticking in the bone
of the wolf's skull. This proof was all
he required.
`Some wolf-hunter has slain the beast
here, and then, wandering up to the fort,
which he supposed vacant, he entered, or
was admitted by the slave, who left with
him or was slain in a quarrel. There
are no other enemies about,' continued
El Zegris, as if satisfied with what he had
discovered. `Yet this person, whoever
he was, will report that the fort is
occupied
again, That I should be found out
here, ere long, I had no doubt; but it will
take more than a force of mountaineers
to dislodge me again from this place, if I
choose to hold it. But I shall hold it
only
till I see how events are going to turn
in Cordova. The revolution may break
out to-morrow. I shall then leave the
fort as empty as I found it and try my
fortunes with some one of the Emirs.
His standard who is likely to conquer I
shall rally under.'
These words were addressed partly to
his follower, but were more the
self-uttered
thoughts of his mind than intended
for the car of the trumpeter.
`It is a large wolf, Effendi l' said the
man as he drew near and gazed on the
dead animal in the path, which it quite
blocked up.
`A monster of his speeies. It was a
true eye and strong man that launched
this spear. It was either Gaspar the
Wolf-slayer or his son, whom Allah
confound
!
If I e'er meet with him again,
we part not till I have avenged my last
defeat. For a more youtha
gazelle-herd-boy
,
without skill or experience, to
conquer me and drive me and mine from
the Sierras, is an ignominy I shall not
bear unavenged.'
`It would be easy in the night to sally
upon the hamlet where they dwell and
come upon them by suprise,' said the
Moor.
`Thou art giving words to my own
thoughts, Melec. I shall not long delay
my vengeance.'
`Here are letters carved on the end of
the spear. They are Christian
characters
,
which I do not read.'
`Let me see them. I have heard these
mountaineers mark their spears, so that
if it be carried off by a wolf, after it has
pierced him, and the animal is found
dead, it may be known to whom its hide
belongs. Let me read. This is the name
of my foe.'
`Gaspar!'
`No. Alfonzo, whom my men call
the Destroyer. This spear is his. The
wolf's hide is his; and would to Allah he
would come and take it while El Zegris
has his foot upon it.'
`If this be the wolf of that man, and it
was he who went into the fort and left
the spear,' said the Moor with some
alarm, `I would rather he would keep
away.'
`I know he is brave, and so, too, is El
Zegris. Whoever knew me to show
fear? I would forfeit a thousand years
in Paradise to see this Alfonze here and
avenge upon him my wrongs.'
`There are few men that would care
to meet him in this place,' answered the
Moor, looking round. `I would
recommend
that we return to the fortress.
`Hark! what shouting is that from it?'
he cried, looking up the mountain to the
stronghold, an angle of which only was
in sight, about three hundred yards
distant
,
the rest of it being concealed by a
projection of a cliff overhanging the deep
gorge in which they were.
`There is confusion among them!'
exclaimed
El Zegris. `Hark! that was the
clash of steel. Listen! a galloping across
the resounding bridge over the moat!
To horse and let us see what this means.'
He vaulted across the back of his
horse, and giving him rein galloped back
the way he had come. A turn in the
defile brought him in full view of the
draw-bridge and part of the tower, in the
gate of which he saw his men
brandishing
their scymetars, and shouting and
sending their lances after a person on
horseback, who was thundering across
the draw-bridge, as if in pursuit of
another
in the dark garb of a mountaineer.
For an instant the two horses with their
riders were in full view; but they were
the next moment lost in the deep path
down which they were careering.
`The Christian dog has been
discovered
in the fort and is pursued!' cried El
Zegris.
`He who pursued him had a female, I
am sure; and the lances were sent after
him more than after the head one,' said
Melec, who continued to ride on at speed
after his chief.
`Then it was so! I was not sure, but
thought the hind one carried a female!'
answered El Zegris.
`Of that I am sure, Captain.'
`On thenonward without slacking
rein. There is no woman in the fort to
come out of it but Genilla, and he who
bore her forth is Diego and none else.
Allah il Allah to the rescue!' he shouted,
brandishing his scymetar, and burying
his spurs deep into the flanks of his horse.
The path-way which led down the
mountain's side from the fort, ran at first
at a sharp angle of descent northwardly,
and then making a sudden turn, ran south
in a zig-zag line, thus making a
succession
of terraces. The wolf had been
slain on the second terrace below, and
from this, in looking up, persons
descending
the first or higher terrace were visible
until they began to enter that deeper part
of it where the angle was made.
The two parties were now approaching
each other, one ascending towards the
deep gorge at the angle, and the other
descending into it. There was also at
this angle a defile, which opened
westerdly
and descended towards the forest,
and so round by the east side of the
mountain; the same ravine by which El
Zegris and his whole party had returned
to the tower, bringing the Moorish
maiden
their captive.
El Zegris would not have galloped
forward
at such speed up the steep path had
he not feared that the fugitives would
take the eastern gorge, and so escape.
That the three persons were the Christian
Alfonzo and Diego bearing off Genilla,
he had no doubt. He had, therefore, a
three-fold motive to urge him onward,
and to nerve his arm to combat. The
portion of road along which he was now
galloping was concealed from the tower
by a brow of beetling rocks.
Alfonzo resolved to bear his fair charge
to the hamlet, and thence conduct her
under a strong escort, if necessary, to her
home. But the Moor Ben Habib was
ignorant
of this determination, and upon
coming to the opening at the angle which
led eastward down the mountains, he
took it without hesitation, and as Alfonzo
passed it he could just see the top of his
bald head disappearing in the depths of
the gorge.
He could not but smile, serious as his
present situation was, at the headlong
equestrianism of the terrified Moor, thus
riding for his head.
`The slave flies with fear for wings,'
he said to the maiden; `I am glad to see
thee so calm. Still retain thy courage
and self-possession, and ere long thou wilt
be in safety.'
`Who are you that thou art risking life
for me?' asked the maiden. `Thy dress
is that of a Moor, but thy speech and face
betray thee to be a Christian.'
Alfonzo did not reply; he had turned
the angle and his eye fell upon the figure
of El Zegris coming up the gorge at full
speed.
The two horsemen discovered each
other simultaneously. Alfonzo had
loooked for a meeting with the chief
somewhere in the gorge on his return to
his tower. He now recognised him, and
at the same moment the chief saw and
recognised the maiden whom he had
destined for his bride. He reined up
and took a second glance at the turbaned
horseman by her side, but was amazed
instead of seeing the features of his
lieutenant
Diego to behold those of the
youthful mountaineer-chief his direct foe.
Even the turban could not disguise or
hide his well-remembered face from El
Zegris, who never forget the features of
a foeman, especially of one by whom he
had been humbled.
`Lady, rein up and remain here and I
will free thee from thy tyrant and make
thee a free passage to liberty,' he said,
putting his hand upon the bit of her horse
and reining him backward. He then
grasped firmly the hilt of the scymetar
which he had taken from the Ethiopian
and charged upon the robber chief, who,
taken by surprise at discovering so
formidable
an atagonist where he expected
to cope only with Diego, seemed to
hesitate
whether to withstand the onset or
retreat for better vantage ground, for he
was lower in the gorge than his
antagonist
.
But Alfonzo's headlong charge
upon
him gave no time for reflection. He
spurred aside as he came upon him and
endeavoured to parry the thrust which
was made at his side. But his scymetar
shivered like glass at the touch of
Alfonzo's
weapon, and the guard of the
hilt striking him in the breast hurled him
from his saddle to the earth. His
follower
without waiting to see the result
had in the outset leaped from his horse
and climbed a cliff with the agility of an
ape, and was full fifty feet in the air
when his chief rolled over upon the
ground.
Alfonzo reined up and dismounted
and pressing his foot upon his chest
said,
`I do not wish to kill thee. Ask thy
life and swear never to disturb the peace
of this maiden whom I have rescued
from thy power, and I will let thee go
free!'
`I will not take my life at thy hand,
slave!' growled the fallen chief in a tone
and with a scrowl of defiance.
`Then I will give it thee. I would not
shock this maiden's eyes by slaying thee
before them; but I will mark thee and
destroy thy power of doing mischief.'
With these words he raised his weighty
scymetar and suddenly letting it fall
upon
the right arm of El Zegris as it lay
stretched out upon the ground he severed
the hand above the wrist at a blow. The
robber howled with rage and pain, and an
exclamation from the Moorish maiden
caused him to turn his eyes in the
direction
in which her finger pointed his
attention
,
when he beheld Diego and his
four followers galloping across the moat.
In an instant recovering again his own
spear he was in the saddle and with the
maiden by his side was urging the two
horses at full flight along the defile. For
a moment he thought he should not be
able to make them pass the dead wolf,
but by the aid of the point of his
scymetar
he sent them madly leaping over the
obstacle. Behind him he could hear the
clatter of the troops of Diego's horses
and the shouts of the Moors. Suddenly
they ceased and he knew that they had
come up with El Zegris. He was
confirmed
in this by a loud outcry from the
spot following the clang of iron hoof
supon
the rocks.
`Allah, protect us!' cried the maiden.
`I fear that even your courage, noble
Emir, may not save either thee or me!'
`Fear not, lady! Were they twice
their number I would not fear them in
thy defence. But they will not follow
far. In a few rods we shall come to a
part of the gorge impracticable for horses.
We will leave our horses in the narrow
defile which will be so completely
blocked
up by them that no horsemen can
get by or beyond them. We will then
make the rest of our way on foot by a
path known only to the mountaineers;
and thus effectually elude pursuit.
Where you cannot walk for the
roughness
of the way I will carry you safely!'
CHAPTER XV.
THE EXPLANATION.
The
gorge along which they were
rapidly pressing their way, narrowed
every moment, until they could only go
on one before the other, Alfonzo being
last. At length they came to the steep
face of a precipice, where the road was
only a mere cleft in the rock not two feet
wide.
Here, by his directions, she alighted,
and also dismounting, joined her. Just
before them was a sort of natural path
over the cliff, accessible only for persons
on foot.
`We will here leave our horses to be
taken by their owners, lady,' said
Alfonzo
,
`and go the rest of the distance
on foot. I hear our pursuers. Let us
make no delay. Your safety is every
thing to me. I am willing they should
say `Alfonzo flies the Moors!' so that
thereby I secure your safety!'
She pressed his hand in silence, but
her eyes beaming with gratitude to her
unknown deliverer were more eloquent
than words. He aided her to climb the
steep path, and in a few minutes they
had left the gorge far below them and
were crossing the open mountain-top in
the vicinity of the cell of the hermit.
They heard no more of their pursuers,
though they listened as they paused to
rest for a moment. In a little while,
Alfonzo
came in sight of his herd and his
noble wolf-dog walking round and round
them, guarding them. Upon seeing his
master, the intelligent animal came
bounding towards him and leaped upon
his shoulder as if he would embrace him,
while his eyes beamed welcome and joy
at seeing him. Alfonzo examined the
wound in his neck made by his spear
when he launched it at the wolf, and was
gratified to find that it was not worth
noticing
and would heal without attention.
From the situation, in which he found his
flock all collected in a close crowd
together
,
he knew that his trusty dog had
compelled them to remain so, not
permitting
them either to feed or move from
the spot till his master should return.
The poor gazelles seemed startled at the
sight of the Moorish costume through
which Ban had instantly recognised his
master, and looked startled when he
approached
them.
`You see, lady, that my herd are
afraid of me, though if I wore my own
costume they would be trotting up to lick
my hands with every sign of joy!'
`Your herd,
Emir?
'
[1]
[1]
A title; and used also as a term of respect,
like sir or senior.
`Yes, lady, I am a gazelle herds-man!'
he answered. `Sit here upon this
mosscovered
stone over-shadowed by this
olive tree, and where I often have st to
4
watch my gazelles, and I will tell thee
who I am and how I came to rescue thee,
for we have had little time to speak with
each other since we left the fort of El
Zegris.'
The maiden gladly availed herself of
the umbrageous seat to which he
conducted
her, a pleasant and elevated yet
secluded nook in the cliff commanding a
wild mountain prospect; and in the
distance
,
between two peaks, was a glimpse
of the golden Guadalquivir. She could
not withhold her eyes from the noble and
youthful countenance of the young man
who had saved her so gallantly from the
hand of the marauding El Zegris. Every
time he turned towards her as he was
discoursing, he saw her dark, rich eyes
drop hurriedly beneath his glance, while
the deep glow of the rose would heighten
the charming tint of her cheek.
`I am, maiden,' he said to her, `but a
poor gazelle-keeper. You see my flock
which is all my worldly wealth, and its
care my only ambition.'
`How is it, then, noble Emir, that I
see you in the dress of one of my
countrymen
?'
she asked, with curiosity and
surprise. `I know, by thy speech, thou
art a Christian, and I know that the
mountaineers are all men of Spain; how
is it that I see you wearing the turban of
a Moslem?'
`I assumed this costume, lady, to save
thee. No other motive would have
induced
me to adopt the garb of the
Infidel
.'
`But I am an infidel as you term the
children of Islam,' answered the maiden,
with something between reproach and
regret. `Didn't you know this at the
first? If so, what am I to thee that thou,
a Christian, the enemy of my race and
faith, shouldst save me as thou hast so
nobly done?'
`Listen to me, lady, and all shall be
made known to thee, for here you are
safe. The Zegri dare not come on this
side of the cliff without their leader, who
will hardly ever lead them again. In
my duty, as a herdsman, not many days
ago, I was seated watching my herd
upon
yonder rocky summit, which
overlooks
the valley of the river and Cordova,
and also looks down upon a tower called
the Emir's tower.'
`My father's home and mine!' she ex
claimed with delight, clapping her hands
with joyful surprise, and gratitude
sparkled
in her glorious oriental eyes. `Oh,
am I so near! I knew not where I was,
but being with thee, though I know thee
not, and know thou art a Christian, I felt
secure. Wilt thou take me to my
father
,
Ben Osmin?'
As soon as thou art rested! Thou
shalt see him ere night!'
`Thanks, noble Christian.'
`I am rewarded in having rescued
thee. Do not thank me, nor look upon
me with such grateful eyes, lady, or I
shall forget that thou art a believer in
Mahomet; I in the cross. I know not
if I ought to linger here a moment, or
hold any discourse with thee.'
`Nay, if I, a Moorish maid, fear thee
not, noble Christian, THOU shouldst have
little scruple!' she answered, with an
arch, yet modest look, that made his
heart, Cupid's faithful time-piece, go
faster
in his bosom, than he ever knew it to
throb before. Her eyes seemed to dart
arrows of fire into his soul. He dared
not look up again to meet her gaze, but
said with downcast eyes
`I will hasten with what I have to say.
While I was seated upon the rock,
looking
down upon the tower, I saw you
appear
in the court-yard, and proceed to
water some flowers.'
`Saw me, noble Christian.'
`Thyself,' he answered with a smile
at her look of perplexed surprise.
`The cliff is at least a thousand feet
above the tower. Thou couldst scarcely
tell me from one of thy gazelles.'
`If I had only seen thy eyes, maiden,
I might not,' he answered with ready
gallantry
,
and at the speech she dropped her
fringed lids to her small Morocco
slippered
feet, and blushed with evident
pleasure
at so delicate a compliment. `But I
saw thee and yet could not distinguish a
feature. I beheld only a grace of motion
that since then, now thou hast been
nigher
to me is proved could only have been
thine own. But not by motion, or form,
or feature do I know that thou art the
same. By thy voice I recognize thee,
lady. I heard thee sing. Heaven only
has such music as floated from that
garden
bower to my ravished ears. I
listened
entranced. It seemed to awaken or
create a new and delightful sense in my
soul. You sang I know not how long.
It might have been a few minutesit
might have been hours for all that I gave
count of the passing time. But I will not
speak in such terms, for I see that it
surprises
thee to hear me, and I know that I
do wrong in suffering the recollection to
animate my words as they do; but my
heart will speak, lady.'
The maiden listened like a startled fawn
at some unusual sound, to his
impassioned
words, for words of passion they were
though he hardly knew it, and swiftly
would he have fled from her in fear, had
he understood that it was love that was
burning in his bosom for the Infidel
maiden
,
and kindling his lips with such warm
eloquence.
`I have offended you, maiden.' he said,
observing her look constantly down.
`No,' she answered in a voice as
musical
as silver; and raised her eyes to his
face. It was only for an instant; but the
look thrilled to his very being.
Lightning
is not more vivid than was this brief
glance, nor is the tremulous dew-drop
softer in the moon-beam.
The young mountaineer was not aware
of his danger, or being aware yielded with
delightful madness to the spell that he
felt she had cast about his heart.
`Maiden,' he continued, taking her
passive hand, and how could the fair
Moorish girl refuse to give her hand into
his whose courage and love had saved
her from a fate so dreaded as to be the
bride of El Zegris? `Maiden, I will not
speak to thee of the hours by day in
which thy voice echoed in the deep of
my soul, and the dreams at night in which
I heard it mingling with every sound as
the star beams are woven with the
darkness
.
I knew thou wert of the Moorish
race, and would have banished thee from
my thoughts. But in vain. In vain I
confessed
my sin and did bitter penance for
my crime.'
`Alas! is it so great a crime for a
Christian to think of a Moorish maiden?'
she said with a sigh of the profoundest
sincerity; for she felt that her heart
already
was her preserver's.
I fear it is, lady,' he said sadly. `And
I resolved no more to think of thee; for
I said, if the notes of her voice have so
moved me, how shall I withstand the
glance of her eye, should we ever meet.'
Here the heautiful girl lifted suddenly
her almond-shaped lids, fringed with
midnight rays, and darted upon him a
glance that would have made captive the
heart even of the holy father Godfrey,
had he been exposed as was Alfonzo his
protege, to their influence.
`I did not expect to meet you, lady,
for we mountaineers have little
fellowship
with or love for the Moors that
settle
about us in the valley. But to-day,
being in pursuit of a wolf, I came upon
the stronghold into which you were
brought by El Zegris, and entered it
without being opposed. It contained but
one Moor, whom I was compelled to drag
with me into a room on suddenly hearing
the returning footsteps of the Chief; for
it was too late to retreat by the gate. I
saw you brought in and heard all that El
Zegris said to you. When I heard your
voice, I recognized it to be the same that
I had heard floating up from the garden
at the foot of the Emir's tower.
Instantly
I resolved to rescue you, for I saw how
you hated the proposed union. I could
have escaped by a loop-hole in the wall,
but I would not leave you in the power
of El Zegris.'
`Noble and brave Christian!'
`I waited until El Zegris rode forth
and his followers, save one, slept. I then
disguised myself in the habiliments of the
Moor, whom I held prisoner in the
apartment
where I was, and sallied out boldly,
saddled the horses, and then slew the
sentry as he nodded on his post. My
next act was to kill the Ethiopian who
guarded your doorto burst it open and
place you before me on the saddle, and
fight my way out. The rest you know,
lady. And now having explained to you
all, we will once more resume our way;
for I doubt not you are desirous of seeing
your father.'
`How shall I thank you, my noble
benefactor
!'
cried the Moorish maid, almost
kneeling in her gratitude at his feet. `I
forget thou art an unbeliever in my
remembrance
of what thou hast done for
me. My father will bless thee also!'
`I ask no return: I have done only my
duty. El Zegris has been punished, and
thou art made happythis is enough for
me. I heard him call thee Genilla.'
`It is my name, noble youth. Now,
wilt thou tell me thine?' she asked with
sweet grace.
`Alfonzo.'
`The Destroyer!' she cried, starting
aside with amazement not unmixed with
fear.
`I thought thou knewest me not, as I
called my name aloud when I rode from
the fortress.'
`I was too much alarmed and confused
to hear. The sounds of clashing steel,
the whizzing of lances, and the shouts of
the robbers, were all that I heard. Art
thou then the brave and heroic
mountaineer
?
Yet why should I askI should
have known thee by thy deeds!'
`Thou wilt hate me too; for if thou
hast heard of me, thou hast also heard I
love not thy peoplethe oppressors of
my native land.'
`Yet from this time I will look upon
thee, Alfonzo, and think of thee, noble
Alfonzo, only as the friend of the Moor!
He who could risk his life to save a
Moorish maiden, cannot be the foe of her
people.'
Alfonzo slowly shook his head, made
no reply, and calling to his dog to guide
the gazelles down the mountain, led the
way with the maiden.
CHAPTER XVI.
THE PARTING.
We
have now brought our story up to
the time when Alfonzo had his first
interview
with the beautiful Genilla. We
have seen how rapidly love intoxicated
his heart as he discoursed with the
beautiful
Genilla. We have seen how
rapidly
love intoxicated his heart as he
discoursed
with her upon the moss-seat
beneath
the wild olive tree on the mountain.
We shall now briefly allude to the events
that followed, and then proceed with the
regular narrative which we broke off after
the parting of the lovers at the tower and
as Alfonzo was returning to his home
where he had left his father watching
over the wounded young Emir.
Alfonzo, then, having conducted the
Moorish maiden to his homble abode,
where he quickly exchanged his Moorish
dress for one more suited to his faith and
race, presented the lovely Moor to his
sister, relating her history. The fair
Xariffa, who had less strong prejudice
than her brother, received the rescued
maiden with sisterly affection; and when,
after an hour's rest with her, she left
under Alfonzo's charge to return to her
father's house, she presented her with a
little silver cross, and sweetly told her
that when she was in sorrow or trouble if
she would pray to him who died upon
a cross, she would find protection and
peace. Genilla accepted the cross rather
as a token of affection than a badge of
faith, and promised she would try its
efficacy
.
Alfonzo then took her once
more under his charge and safely
conducted
her to the tower, where she found
that Ben Osmin had just returned from
Cordova, whither he had been to get
troops to pursue the robbers, who had
carried off his daughter; but could
obtain
none, each of the ruling Emirs
fearing
to let any of his own followers go,
as a revolution was daily, if not hourly,
expected to break out. He, therefore,
returned in despair just before the
arrival
in safety of his lost daughter. He
embraced her with tears, and was nearly
beside himself with joy, crying and
laughing by turns.
Alfonzo had not delayed a moment
after leaving her, as he was anxious to
return and head an expedition against
the tower, and besides he did not wish to
hear the Moor's thanks for the service
done his daughter.
From that time he became a frequent
visitor at the cottage of the Moor, till old
Ben Osmin thought it best to ask the
young lover if he intended to become a
Moslem; if so, he might still visit
Genilla
;
but if not, he must cease coming to
the Emir's tower.
`I owe you my child's happiness and
safety,' he said to him, `but, by the
beard of the Prophet! I cannot have her
saved from El Zegris to be lost again to
a Christian. The Zegris is at least half
Moor, while thou hast not a drop of the
true blood in thy veins. I thank thee,
Christian, for the rescue of my child; but
I cannot consent that you should have
her as the price of it. So let there be
peace between us and the shadow of thy
body cast no more across my threshold!'
Alfonzo bowed in quiet submission to
the will of the Moor. He could not
become
a Moslem, even for Genilla's love.
All the while the maiden stood by in
silence, her hands folded upon her breast,
as if she perfectly submitted to her
father's
decree. She well knew that the
young mountaineer would not change his
religion; therefore she did not ask him.
But she also knew that he would not
cease to love her.
Without a word he left the presence
of the old Moor; but he had caught the
dark glance of the maiden as he passed
out and translated into, `Wait by the
tower and I will speak with thee,
Alfonso
.'
So he waited at the southern angle of
the tower, and in three minutes Genilla
was by his side. Her eyes were
sparkling
with moisture and her cheek was
pale; that emotion which she suppressed
and concealed in the presence of her
father now showed itself before the
lover.
`Alfonzo, we cannot part thus!'
`No, Genilla! Yet I feel that your
father has instructed me in my duty. I
ought
not to see you again. Day by day
I have been self-condemned for loving
thee! But in vain have I tried to break
the sweet spell with which thou hast
bound my heart to thee! I would say
in the morning, I will see Genilla no
more, and yet evening would find me by
thy side! I have felt miserable because
I loved thee, and ye more wretched
when I thought that I must one day give
thee up, or perish!'
`It need not be, Alfonzo!'
`What wilt thou become a Christian?'
cried Afonzo, with joy.
`No, no, I said not so. I cannot
become
a Christian, but for me thou wilt
become a follower of the Prophet of
God!'
`
I
, a Mahommadoun!' he cried,
shrinking from her in holy horror. `I a
Moslem believer? Never, never,
Genilla
,!
I love thee with all my being,
but I detest thy faith!'
`We will not darken this hour of
parting
by more words like these, Alfonzo.
I love thee, because gratitude lies at the
bottom of my love; and I cannot cease
to love thee whatever thou art. We will
speak of this subject no more. But we
are not to part now forever!'
`I hope I shall see you again, yet I sin
in saying so!'
`Sin! Sin for thee to love me! Oh,
what a severe faith is thine, Alfonzo!'
she said, softly and reproachfully. `It
is no sin for me to love thee as I do!'
`If the Holy Church knew that I loved
an Infidel maiden, as I love thee Genilla,
it would cast me forth from its bosom.'
`Would to Allah it would; then the
fold of Islam would open its gate to
receive
thee!'
`I would rather perish with the curse
of the Church upon my head than
embrace
thy false faith!'
`We were to speak no more on this
theme,' she said, smiling. `I forgive
thy words for thy sake. I have not
come to meet thee, Alfonzo, to make
thee a Mussleman, but to tell thee that I
and my father are of two minds. He
would have thee stay away, I would have
thee come! Wilt thou come secretly to
see me! For thou art the star of my
life, now! To love thee and to be
conscious
that I am beloved by thee is all of
existence that I feel! Thy love is the
breath of my being. Wilt thou come!'
`Yes, Genilla! I would refuse to see
thee again, for it is better to lose thee in
this world than to lose my soul in the
next; but I cannot say so. I
must
come.'
And he did come often and secretly,
till their hearts grew together as one
heart, and save in faith they were one.
Yet Alfonzo loved with a heavy
conscience
.
He kept the secret of his love
from the hermit, and this made him
unhappy
;
for to an ingenuous mind
concealment
is hateful. He felt he was
doing wrong in loving the Moorish
maiden
;
but he hoped to convert her to
Christianity, and with this weak
defence
of his conduct he let the current of
his peep passions drive him onward. On
her part she felf none of those
compunctious
visitings of conscience for
loving Alfonzo. He had won her heart
by the service he had done her.
Christian
,
or Moor, or Pagan, even, she could
not cease to love him. And she too, it
was the sweet hope of her young heart,
she too hoped by the talisman of love to
allure him to the faith of Islam, which to
her was the Faith of Faiths.
So the current of their loves ran
smoothly on, disturbed only by brief
discussions
upon their respective faiths.
Their meetings were secret, and not less
delightful that they were so. It
rendered
Genilla dearer to Alfonzo in that her
sweet society was not to be purchased
without danger.
We have now got back to our lover as
he is proceeding homeward from the
Emir's tower after his last visit, that visit
in which he had found the hermit
closeted
with Ben Osmin, and on which he
learned Genilla's determination to
accompany
her father the next morning
into
Cordova.
He walked slowly along through the
dark cork-tree forest, his way at intervals
being lighted up by a patch of moonlight
laying like shining water-pools upon the
green sward. He was busily occupied
as he paced along, in thinking about his
love for Genilla, and her contemplated
visit to Cordova. He did not like to have
her go, so beautiful and unskilful in the
ways of the world as he knew her to be;
and he feared thatin a word he began
to feel jealous. He was very much
afraidif he had dared to confess his
feelings to himselfthat some one of the
handsome and dashing Saracen cavaliers
with whom Cordova swarmed, might see
her and captivate her susceptible heart,
and steal her affections away from
himself
.
This idea, once fairly got into the
head of the young mountain lover,
troubled
him vastly. Half a dozen times he
was on the eve of turning back and
insisting
with all a lover's eloquence that
she should not go; but he was every time
deterred from this lest she should suspect
his motives; and to be thought to be
jealous
is exceedingly annoying to a lover
when he
is
jealous.
`I will let her go,' he at length said;
`if some gay Saracen knight falls in love
with her and she returns his passion, as
she
may
for I am but a poor
mountaineer
and a Christianit will be best for
me! In loving her as I do, I feel I am
risking my soul's salvation. But I should
be miserable not to love her! So
beautiful
,
so gentleshe was made for me to
love her! Oh, Genilla! if thou wert
only a Christian!'
He sighed and walked on rapidly, as
if he would run from his thoughts.
Suddenly
he heard the tramp of horses, and
voices ahead of him. He drew aside,
and upon seeing the party come near, he
knew that it was a Moorish cavalcade of
hunters, for there were hounds in leach,
and two falconers with birds riding in
front.
`It will be a sad tale to bear back to
Cordova,' said one of the horsemen, a
richly dressed Saracen, who seemed to
be the chief of the party, addressing a
young man in a green turban who rode
by his side.
`It will indeed,' answered the other;
`but I trust that he has found his way
down the mountain by some other path.
It is more than likely we shall find him
at the palace when we arrive.'
`Allah grant it! But on my soul be
it! I would rather it had been myself lost
or perished than he; and at this time,
too, when our faction hoped so much
from him. But I hope the best! God is
greatand what is to be will be!'
`It is barely possible he may have
found shelter in the hut of some
mountaineer
,'
said another of those who rode
slowly along in front.
`That would be as fatal to his life as if
he had fallen from a precipice,'
responded
the first speaker. `It was folly in him
going out to hunt on the Sierras, and
being
there, rash for him to separate
himself
from us. But I have done my best.
We will return to Cordova, and if he be
not there before uswhich Allah bring
to pass!I will head a fresh party in the
morning and scour the mountain.'
The horsemen by this time had passed
some distance the spot where Alfonzo
stood unseen. Their conversation at once
brought to his recollection his wounded
guest, whom he had left two hours before
under the uncertain protection of his
father
,
Gaspar, the Wolf-slayer; and whom
he had forgotten in his thoughts about
Genilla. He now knew that his guest
was the leader of the party which had
passed, and that, having given up the
search, they had been collected together
by their lieutenant, and were returning
to Cordova full of sorrow at their loss.
His first impulse was to follow them,
and relieve their anxiety by informing
them where the young Emiras he
doubtless waswas lying. But the
reflection
how dangerous it might prove to
introduce a lawless Moorish party into
the quiet hamlet, checked this purpose in
his mind as soon as it was formed.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE HERDSMAN'S CABIN.
Alfonzo
did not, however, suffer his
generous impulse to subside in his bosom
without giving it at least some vent. He
watched until the cavalcade had entirely
past, save a single Moorish slave who
rode a donkey some way in the rear,
laden with tent equipage.
He came out from behind the tree
where he had placed himself, and laying
his hand upon the hempen bridle of the
ass, he said to the surprised Moor,
`Ride forward and tell thy master that
his chief is safe, and in three days will
be in Cordova! Say to him that he need
not search for him, as he will not find
him; but in three days he will behold
him in Cordova.'
Having thus spoken, he left the slave
as suddenly as he had appeared before
him. The Moor, as soon as he could
recover
from his surprise, galloped forward,
and Alfonzo could hear him shouting,
`Yallah, yal-il-lah!' to the troop before
him; `Yallah, the glorious Emir is
found!'
Alfonzo heard the commotion that
followed
this loud out-cry of the slave, and
the trampling of the horses as their riders
turned back to question the slave,
reached
his ears. He did not wait, however,
for the Moor to tell his story; but,
striking
off into the forest, was soon out of
danger of being overtaken by the
pursuing
hunters, who, upon hearing the
intelligence
,
proceeded to search the forest
for the informant. At length, Alfonzo
could hear their chief wind a recall upon
his bugle; and, a little while afterwards,
as he ascended the first steps of the
mountain side towards the hamlet, could
see a mile distant, in an opening of the
forest, the steel arms of the party once
more in column, galloping over the plain
towards the city.
`They will now wait patiently for their
chief,' said Alfonzo, as he climbed the
path by the side of the cataract; `and
by the end of the three days, I trust he
will be well, as father Godfrey has said.
The hamlet is safe from their
marauding
visit; and Xariffa from their free
admiration
.'
He soon reached the summit of the
rocking table over which the cataract
tumbled like wreathed clouds of silver in
the bright moonlight, and in a few
moments
afterwards he was in front of his
hut. All the way through the forest, as
he had come, he had been expecting to
overtake the hermit; and as the
cavalcade
of Moors had not fallen in with
him, the result of which would have been
to make him their prisoner, he began to
suspect that he had not returned to the
mountain; but had, perhaps, gone on foot
towards the city; but wherefore, unless
to meet the Infidel Ben Osmin there the
next day, he could not divine. But that
he would venture there, he could hardly
believe; for, much as the Saracen
conquerors
hated the Christians as a nation,
they despised the priests, and never let
slip an occasion of doing them a
mischief
.
He now entered the hut softly, and not
hearing any noise, he approached the
couch where, three hours before, he had
left the wounded Moor asleep under the
influence of the soporific ointment which
the hermit had rubbed into his wound.
There, buried in deep sleep, the
youthful
Saracen lay as he had left him. His
handsome features were less false than
before, and his breathing was more
natural
.
One jewelled hand lay beneath
his cheek and partly concealed by his
dark hair. His long eye-lashes lay in an
arch of dark curving lines upon his cheek.
Beautiful as he was, yet his features
were manly and noble, and seemed to
bear the impress of mingled courage and
gentleness. As Alfonzo gazed upon him,
he saw his nether lip move and twitch
uneasily, and at times nervously curve
itself into an expression of exceeding
pride and ferocity. He recollected
seeing
the same expression upon his
countenance
when he first beheld him
advancing
towards him in the mountain
path and haughtily commanding him and
the hermit to stand aside for him.
`The soul may be brave and the spirit
gentle; but that look, which sleep has
betrayed, shows that his heart is bad.
Noble and beautiful as he is, from this
hour, I could rather fear than trust him.
The sooner he recovers his strength, and
is on his way to Cordova, the better I
shall feel.'
`Ha, boy! Hast thou come back?
What is the hour o' the night?'
This voice came from Gaspar, whom
Alfonzo saw lying at full length upon a
wolf's hide, at the head of the couch.
He had fallen asleep with his forehead
upon his boar-spear, and the voice of the
young man raised him to a sense of his
duty.
`It is near the mid hour of night,
father
.
Has he waked yet?'
`Not while I have kept awake; but,
by the mass! by the feeling about my
eyes, I think I have been sleeping. He's
safe, though!' added the wolf-hunter.
`We shall yet have our bout together for
his jewels and goldthe Holy Virgin
permitting it!' he added, crossing his
bearded chest with the point of his spear.
`Hast thou seen the holy father?'
asked Alfonzo, looking round the large,
gloomy apartment of the cabin.
`No, not since he left here at the first
o' the evening. He is no doubt by this
hour at his midnight vigils. What do
you want with him, boy?'
`Nothing, father. Where is my
sister
?
Has she been in the room to-night?'
`I have not seen her. She sleeps in
her room as a maiden ought at this hour.'
`You can also go to your couch,
father
.
I will watch by our guest.'
`Can I trust thee, boy?'
`Dost thou think I covet the Moors
gew-gaws? No, no, father; I am not
yet a robber even of a Moor.'
`Nor am I, by the mass! Yet will I
fight him fairly for these so soon as
father
Godfrey pronounces him a well
man. Call me at the dawn. I have
business on hand. I would first get the
hide o' the wolf he says he has wounded.
He will ne'er ask for it, and if he should,
he will not get it. At least the wolves of
the mountains belong to us. The Moor
has all else of oursour lands and rivers,
our cities and churches, and even our
maidens for his harem. By the red
rood! he shall leave us the wolves.
Wake me at dawn, boy.'
With these words, old Gaspar cast
himself again upon the rude pallet from
which Alfonzo's entrance had aroused
him, and in two minutes he was breathing
heavily in deep sleep.
Alfonzo gazed instantly from one to
the other, and could not but remark the
contrast between the physicel strength of
muscle and sinew of one, and the
graceful
eloquence of form of the other. Both
alike slept unconscious of each other,
unconscious
of the gazer. The cabin was
silent, save the deep respirations of the
wolf-slayer. An iron lamp, fed by rezin
from the barlec tree of the mountains,
stood upon a wooden shelf near the head
of the bed. It cast its dusky light
strongly
upon the faces of the sleepers, and
penetrated faintly to the extremities of
the large apartment. There was little to
attract the eye in the room. A settle or
two of oak placed on either side of a wide
fire-place, a rude table, a dresser in one
corner containing a few articles of
pewter
ware; a picture of the Virgin by the
side of one lattice, and a huge cross of
cork-wood, smoked black over the
chimney
piece, completed the furnishing of
the herdsman's chief apartment. The
floor was paved with flat pieces of stone
taken from the brook close at hand, and
the hearth was a fragrant as smooth as
polished marble. The windows were
low, and latticed strongly in
diamond-shaped
panes, but without glass. There
were but two doors in the room; one that
opened from without, and another of
smaller size that led into an inner room
of the cabin. The roof of the hut was
open, with its rafters to the eye black
and smoked, and garnished with cob-web
festoons of a score of years. The cabin
was surrounded in part by an enclosure
of pickets, in which the goats and
gazelles
were folded at night. A portion
of this fold had a covering of bark,
beneath
which in cold stormy weather the
herd might gather for shelter and mutual
warmth.
There were hanging about on the walls
on the inside of the cabin, the coarse
apparel
of herdsmenpalm-hats with wide
brims, and sandals of cork with white
lacings
.
In one corner stood a bunch or
faggot of oaken staves for boar-spears
for Gaspar's hunting-spear had often to
be replaced by a new one. There was
also a crook and a Moorish lance and
sword, and several pieces of Moorish
armour
trophies
taken by Gaspar in his
first battles with the Infidels, a score of
years before. There hung also above
the mantle-piece the gigantic scymetar
which Alfonzo had taken from the
Ethiopian
he had slain; and dangling from a
knob by it was suspended the hilt of the
shivered yataghan which he had taken
from the severed hand of El Zegris.
There also hung about the cabin many
wolf-skins, trophies also of the young
mountaineer's courage, and proofs of his
faithfulness in protecting his herd from
its fiercest foe.
Alfonzo gazed a few moments upon
the face of the young Moorish prince, and
then slowly walked away, and opening
the door that led to the inner room, he
passed through a little entry and then
came to a second door. Here he tapped
lightly with the tips of his fingers;he
had to repeat the call, when a hand was
heard moving the button within, and a
voice, soft and womanly, said
`Is it you, brother?'
`Yes, Xariffa; can I come in?'
The door opened, and he entered a
small white-washed chamber, with a
paved floor covered with rushes, little
sacred
pictures upon the spotless walls, a
bed upon a wooden framea great
luxury
in a mountain cabinupon which was
a covering of the whitest linenrelics of
Gaspar's once noble style of
house-keeping
in the palmier days of Spain. There
were several little luxuries in the room,
all once his wife's, and barely saved as
mementoes to the daughter of her noble
birth. There was a little stand between
two windows, on which was a covering
of silver embroidery, faded indeed, but
exquisitely wrought. There was also a
little oval silver-gilt mirror hanging above
it, kept polished by a ball of doe-skin,
that was suspended by its side from a
silken thread. Upon the table also was
a silver cruet for scented waters,
curiously
embossed, and two or three small rolls
of parchment, tied with orange-colored
ribbon. These rolls were, one of them
a missal of her prayers, another a history
of the Virgin, and a third a `Book of the
sayings of Christ, from his fourth to his
twelfth year, compiled by a learned and
devout monk.'
There was over the head of the bed a
small shelf, on which stood a crucifix of
black wood, and from a nail over that
hung a small muslin bag containing
relics
:
there was a hair from the eye-brow
of the Virgin; a piece of a chip that
Jesus had chisselled off in his father's
carpenter's shop, when he was a boy; a
strand of the whip of small cords, with
which our Saviour drove the money
changers from the temple; a hair of the
tail of the colt that he rode into Jerusulem
on; and a thorn of the crown that he
wore when he was crucified!!! These
were but a portion of the treasures in this
sacred bag. It had descended to Xariffa
from her mother, and was devoutly
reverenced
by Gasparindeed it was the
only thing he did reverence.
But the mind of his daughter was too
much enlightened to give value to such
light things as these relics. She held
them sacred, not that she believed them
to be what they were represented to be,
but they were sacred as a mother's
legacy. Father Godfrey had taught her
too faithfully and well for her to mistake
superstition for religion.
The moon was lighted only by a broad
beam of the moon-light that came in at
one of the windows; but reflected as it
was from the snow-white walls on all
sides, there was need of no more light
than this afforded. By it the beautiful
Andalusian maiden could be seen to be
beautiful, dark-eyed, and as graceful as
a mountain-sylph. She was scarcely
seventeen; wore her rich brown tresses
free upon her shapely shouldersand
being now robed in a loose night-dress
that, as she let in her brother, she
gathered
about her form, one hand holding it
to her bosomshe seemed to be some
lovely statue just warmed into life.
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE INFIDEL GUEST.
`
Thou
wert awake, Xariffa,' said the
young gazelle-keeper, as he took a seat
by the moon-lit window, which looked
out upon the sparkling water-fall.
`Yes, brother; I cannot sleep when
the moon shines so bright,' she said in a
sweet voice, that was only equalled by
that of Genilla, the Moorish maiden.
`Where have you been? I went out for
you a little while since.'
`Did you!' he cried with surprise;
`and whom saw you?' he asked, as he
thought he discovered something like
hesitation in her manner.
`I found my father asleep by your
couch, and upon it lay a strangera
Moor!'
`And did you not before know he was
here?' he asked, pointedly.
`Teresa, the herd's wife, came in and
said you had brought a stranger in, whom
you had found on the mountain; but
when I would have entered the
apartment
,
my father met me and bade me go
to bed, saying I had no business there.'
`And yet you went again afterwards,'
he said archly.
`Yes, brother. Not being able to sleep,
I was seated by my window looking at
the play of the light upon the cataract,
when I heard a commotion in the
gazelle-fold
.
Fearing that a wolf was prewling
near, I went to call you; the door was
unfastened, and I entered; my father
was asleep, and, as I said, I saw the
handsome stranger lying upon your bed.'
`You saw, then, that he was handsome,
Xariffa.
`Yes; and he looked so interesting
and pale that, if he had not been a Moor,
my heart would have felt for him. Still
I could not but pray that his soul might
not be lost.'
`I am glad he saw thee not. Go out
no more while he is hereit were
dangerous
for him to see thee!'
Upon hearing her brother say this,
Xariffa refrained from saying further
that the young stranger
did
open his eyes
while she was standing looking at him
with sympathizing bosom, and that
alarmed
she had fled back to her own room,
and filled with wonder and curiosity to
know who he was and all about him.
She did not tell her brother this,
therefore
,
nor that it was thinking of the Moor
as, much as the glare of the moonlight
that made her wakeful. She was seated
at her window recalling and dwelling
upon his features, when the tap
announcing
Alfonzo recalled her to herself.
`I hope you did not stay long when
you discovered him?' said Alfonzo.
`No.'
`And what happened in the fold?
When was this noise which you heard?'
`An hour ago. When I got back to
my room all was still; I have heard
nothing
since, or I should have waked my
father.'
`Why did you not wake him then?'
`For fear he would be displeased at
seeing me there, and also for fear I might
alarm the stranger.'
`I am glad it is no worse. This
stranger
,
Xariffa, is a Moor. I met him just
at twilight on the mountain: it was at the
meeting of the two paths by the old date
treeyou know that there there is a
narrow
ledge?'
`I know it well; it was there you saved
me from the wolf, that would otherwise
have rent me in pieces, dear brother!'
she answered, laying her pretty brown
hand in his, and fixing upon his face from
her dark Andalusian eyes looks of
grateful
affection. The moon-beams fell like
a veil of transparent silver upon her pure
brow, and gave a lustre to her beauty
that night and moonlight only can lend.
He let his gaze rest upon her lovely face
for a moment in tender admiration. He
thought how like Genilla were the brow
and deeply shaded eyes; and the voice,
how some of its tones resembled those of
the Moorish maiden;and he loved
Xariffa
more for this resemblance to Genilla,
and his love for Genilla received new
impetus
from her likeness to Xariffa.
`On that rock where father Godfrey and
I were resting, with room but for us two,
when this Moor appeared armed with a
broken spear, and with a flushed cheek.
Upon seeing us his bearing became
haughty and he commanded us, calling
us Christian dogs, to let him pass.'
`Alas, he looks so gentle now as he
sleeps?'
`For the sake of Genilla '
`For her sake! Hast thou not cast
the Moslem girl from thy heart, brother?'
she cried, with surprise and an aspect of
alarm.
`Can I not say for her sake, even if I
have done so? Did I not once love her,
sister Xariffa? Be assured I shall never
hate Genilla,' he said, firmly. `For her
sake, I said I resolved not to resist the
Moor's fierce demand. So I stood aside,
almost hanging over the verge, balanced
by a hold upon the trunk of the date
tree. But the holy hermit, not
recognising
the appellation given us, refused to
move, and the fiery Moor aimed a blow
at his breast; but before I could ward it
off, the hand that held the broken spear
dropped by his side powerless and he
sunk at the feet of the good father
insensible
and bleeding from a wound which
he before said he had got from an
encounter
with a wild boar or a wolf.'
`Father Godfrey at once took pity on
him, for his anger extends not to the
unfortunate
,
and bade me raise him up and
bear him to the hut. I obeyed. We
dressed his wounds and in the molient
which de poured upon them was a
sleeping
power, under which the Moor now
lies. The holy father, who is a skilful
leech, says that by the third day he will
recover and be able to go to his people.'
`Dost thou know who he is, brother?'
`Thou hast too much curiosity, I fear
me, touching him. But thou art discreet,
He is a dangerous person for thee to be
seen by him. He is a Moor! and that is
enough for thee, Xariffa! Thou art
safe now in the ignorance of the lawless
Saracen that so fair a flower as thou art
blooms in the mountain glens; but
whether this man be Prince or peasant,
he will, if he sees thee, bear the fame of
thy beauty to Cordova. From that hour
thou art no longer safe here.'
`There is no danger to me, brother,
from one so noble looking! Prince or
peasant! He is not the latter; and may
be the former.'
`Thou talkest as if thou didst wish it
would prove so. What is it matter to
thee, sister, whether he be the one or the
other. Which wouldst thou most regard
a Christian Peasant, or a Saracen Emir.'
`The peasant, brother. Why shouldst
thou ask me?'
`I thought thy words showed a regard
for this Moor.'
`The Virgin forbid! I pitied but his
misfortunes.'
Alfonzo said no more. He knew
that he, a Christian, madly loved a
Moorish maiden and he found that even
Xariffa might love a handsome Moorish
youth! But then she had no tie of
gratitude
to bind her to the stranger. He
had done her no service to awaken
attachment
for him in her young and
guiIeless
bosom. In a word, thought he
within himself, she has `no
motive
,' as I
had, for loving. My fears are
groundless
.
She is too pure a pupil of the holy
father Godfrey to fix her heart upon an
unbeliever. I will see that he does not
see her, and there will be no danger
from what is past!'
`The hour is late for thee to be
awake,' he said. `I will go and look
into
the fold. It may be that a wolf has
been abroad! Did you hear Ban give
the alarm?'
`Yes, he barked violently at the time.
But, as I said, all was soon silent again!'
`It was perhaps only a false alarm.
But I will go out and see. I shall then
return to watch with this stranger, who I
wish was safe in Cordova. But it is
father
Godfrey's commands that I extend
to him the usages of mountain hospitality
until he is well. Ere many hours he will
awake, and perhaps he will need a
nurse's care.'
`I will give it, brother.'
`No, no! It would be setting the
dove to watch the new-fledged hawk. I
will see Teresa Pablo's wife and entrust
this duty to her. I shall be in the
mountains all day. Wilt thou promise
me one thing, Xariffa?'
`Whatever thou desirest brother. I
can deny nothing to thy request.'
`Then go not near him on the morrow.
Keep out of his sight with discreet care.
I have good reasons for it. Would to
the saints he had never been led this
way, and thus cast upon me. But if we
must harbour the lion, we must take heed
that he does us no harm.'
`I promise you, brother. The Moor is
handsome, but do not fear for my heart,'
she said, laughing. `I could never love
a Moor, were he an angel.'
`I question whether there are many
Moors who are angels, or are like to be.'
`What; not Genilla! But I ought not
to speak to thee of her. Fear not for me.
I care not for him, save that I shall pray
for his soul.'
`Thou hadst best not. It will make
thee think of him in thy prayers, when
thou shouldst be thinking of the Virgin,
and her beloved son. It will do thee no
good to pray for this Infidel, sister. Let
him alone. Only promise me he shall not
see thee.'
`This I have already done.'
`Then good night. I now go to the
fold, and if all is quiet I shall go back to
the room where our guest lies, und there
watch with him till he wakes. Good
night sister. The saints keep thee in
their safe keeping.'
`And guard thee also, brother,' she
answered, as she withdrew her graceful
form from the gentle embrace of his
fraternal
arm.
Alfonzo went out to see if all were
quiet in the fold. He passed first along
a narrow walk by the side of the cabin,
and came to a gate-way in a high
picketed
enclosure, over which a brow of the
mountain hung like a roof. It was a close
and sheltered covert, and inaccessible to
wolves save only from the rock above;
from which more than once these fierce
beasts had boldly leaped from a height of
thirty feet into the midst of the herd.
But it was a leap to certain death, for
escape
being denied them, tbey always
were slain after fiercely combatting with
Gaspar or Alfonzo. The latter now
walked around the fold and found all
quiet. Ban the dog came near, and
rubbed
his head against his side, and
seemed
unusually alert; but there were no
signs of an enemy. The gazelles were
all quietly nestled in one corner of the
fold, and all wore an air of peace and
security
.
He then left the spot, pausing an
instant
to gaze upon the dark mountains
around him, and casting a glance at the
skies in which the moon walked in her
brightness, attended by the brightest stars
of the night's train.
He now re-entered the cabin and
approached
the couch. The Moor awoke
as he came near, or rather raised his eyes
and closed them again, murmuring a few
words. Alfonzo went near him, when
he again raised his eye-lids, and gazed
upon him.
Allah, give me memory,' he said,
where am I? Who art thou?'
`Thy host, Moor. Take this. It is a
portion left thee by a skilful leech.'
The young man took it with looks
partly unconscious, and a bewildered air.
Who art thou?' he asked again.
`Thy friend. Sleep and get strength,
for thou hast need of it,' said Alfonzo,
who saw that he was yet but partially
restored to consciousness.
`I have seen a vision. I thought I had
been in Paradise. A houri came and
bent over me, and told me that I was
immortal. But who art thou? What
dreary place is this? This is no
paradise
,
for thou art a Christian dog.'
`Moor,'began Alfonzo; but
checked
the indignant words that leaped to his
lips. The next moment the Infidel was
buried in profound sleep as before.
`He is asleep. How quickly. He
was not fully awake. What meant he
by that vision. Xariffa is as lovely as
the houri of this Mahommedan's paradise.
Could he have seen her. The Virgin
mother forbid. Yet I feel troubled at his
words. I hope he will sleep well, and
depart sound at early dawn. I will help
him away. I know not why, but I feel a
foreboding of evil weighing upon my
heart through this man. He shall depart
at dawn. if I have to take him again
upon
my shoulders and thus carry him
within
a stone's throw of the gate of Cordova.'
CHAPTER XIX.
THE EMIR AND HIS HOSTS.
The
morning broke upon the sleepers
and the watcher. With the first grey
light Gaspar shook sleep from him, as if
it had been a mantle, and standing up
said, as he set aright his gasban and
bernash
,
adjusted his skin-cap upon his locks,
sheathed his knife and grasped his wolf
spear,
`The Moor is sound. Thy father's
potion is strong, boy. Didst thou give
him the second?'
`Yes,' father. He is under its
influence
.'
`I would not value a pair of goats that
he were now well again. My fingers
itch to handle his jewels. See; he is
stirring, and look at the door; yonder
comes the hermit in his round cap, and
haggard enough he looks. Good
morning
,
holy man. Thy blessing for the
day,' and the stout wolf-killer dropped on
his knees upon the stone floor of his cabin
before the tall form of the hermit, who,
at the moment, entered the hut.
`Thou hast it, son,' answered the
monk, touching him upon the uncovered
crown of the head. `Thou dost not ask
the same, my son,' said the hermit, fixing
his eyes on Alfonzo, who stood aloof.
`No, father,' answered the young man,
who felt that he did not deserve to ask a
blessing at his hand, so long as he loved
Genilla so wilfully and madly as he did.
`Kneel!'
Alfonzo obeyed, but with evident
reluctance
,
conscious of his guilty secret.
He received the blessing in silence, and
with shame at heart. He rose suddenly,
as if his generous soul disdained the
hypocrisy
of the knee to which he had
yielded, when he had felt, that if father
Godfrey knew all, he would pronounce a
curse instead of a blessing, upon his head.
The young Moor now not only looked
round upon them with an air of
consciousness
,
but raising himself up on his
elbow
,
he said in good Spanish:
`How is it that I am here? You are
a Christian, I see. Explain to me, for I
can remember nothing, distinctly,' and
he fixed his eyes upon the hermit.
`Thou hast been wounded, Moor, as
thou saidst, by a wolf, and I had thee
brought hither under the roof of this
honest
goat-herd and his son. I dressed
thy wounds, and have had as much care
taken of thee as if thou wert not a
scorner
of the holy faith.'
`Thanks, thanks; I remember that I
saw thee. Thou shalt be remembered.
Gold I have, and it shall be given thee.
When was this?'
`Yesterday.'
`It seems longeras if many days had
passed. I am still weak, I find,' he said,
as he made an effort to sit up.
`You will be better to-morrow. Has
he drank the potion, Alfonzo?' asked the
hermit.
`I gave it to him about two hours after
after midnight, father.'
`Then he will mend rapidly. But it
is needful that thou shouldst remain till
thou has strength to walk away.'
`I would rather then go now; for I
am unable to move far. Hast thou seen
any of my people about?'
`I met last night, Moor,' answered
Alfonzo
,
`a party of Moorish horse,
evidently
a hunting party. I heard their
chiefs discoursing, and learned from their
words that they had lost their leader in
the mountains. I supposed that thou
must be the person they were so
concerned
for, and I took occasion to speak
to one of the party, and bid him tell
their lieutenant that thou wert safe, and
would be in Cordova in three days at the
farthest, and that they need make no
further
search for thee.'
`Ha! and didst thou not tell them
where I was, that they might come for
me?' cried the Moor, with a flushed brow
and angry eyes.
`I did not,' calmly responded the
young mountaineer, firmly meeting the
Saracen's fiery glance. `I did not care
to have a Moorish horde invade the
retirement
of my mountain home. I thought
it better to conduct thee, when thou wert
well enough, myself to the walls of
Cordova
.'
`And did the chief let you pass
unquestioned
?'
demanded the irritated
young Emir.
`It was in the forest I discovered them.
I was unseen by them, and so heard their
discourse as they rode by; and, after all
had ridden on, save a Moorish slave
mounted on a pack mule, I stepped out
from my concealment and bade him tell
his masters the words I have already
repeated
.
He rode forward at once, and
in a few moments afterwards the forest
resounded with the cries and tramp of
pursuit. But I escaped their search, and
reached my hut here in safety about
midnight
.
But I have reason to believe that
thy followers, if thou art their chief,
returned
to Cordova.'
`Thou deservest death, Christian, for
thus withholding the knowledge of my
being
here!' cried the Saracen, angrily.
`Moor!' cried Gaspar, who had been
standing by and frowning upon the
Infidel
in silence; `I would caution thee to
be chary of thy speech here. Thou art
not in Cordova among thy friends, but in
the free mountains among thy enemies.
Discreet speech becomes thee.'
`Dost thou menace me?' cried the
Moor, clenching his hand as if he would
grasp a scymetar.
`Gaspar,' said the hermit, `worry him
not. This treatment of an invalid
becomes
thee not, especially when he is
thy guest. Infidel, thou art wholly in the
power of the Christian. But thou shalt
not he harmed. I will see that thou art
attended to till thy strength is restored,
and then send thee safely to Cordova.
But thou must be quiet, and also have
full confidence in my skill.'
`I can do no otherwise. I will trust
thee, leech!' answered the Moor, faintly.
`Gaspar, go forth to thy day's duties;
and, Alfonzo, remain thou here,' said the
monk.
The wolf-slayer went out, darkly
frowning upon the Saracen, who had
fallen back exhausted upon his coarse
pillow. Father Godfrey examined and
dressed his wound, and gave him a drink
of some healing mixture; and, darkening
the room, went forth with Alfonzo,
leaving
him to sleep.
`Father,' said Alfonzo, as they stood
without, `I like not the longer presence
of this wolf in my fold!'
`It will be but a day or two. I and
four men will make him a litter and bear
him away, and leave him at the first
Moor's dwelling on the plain.'
`It might endanger his life. He wants
quiet, my son. I know the virtues of the
medicine I have given him. It will
invigorate
him rapidly. He must not be
removed; and, besides, it would
endanger
thee and thy men. The Moors thou
wouldst go amongst might quarrel with
thee and do thee a mischief.'
`Not coming on such an errand?'
`Thou hadst best not trust to them.
Why can he not share the hospitality of
thy roof? He has gold, and will repay
thee?'
`I would not touch the Infidel's gold
for such a thing, father. ButI will
tell thee freely. Thou knowest my
sister
Xariffa is very fair.'
`No Infidel maid can compare with
her; and she is as good as she is comely.'
`I fear that if this firey young Saracen
lays eyes upon her, he will covet her.
The very thought kindles my cheek.'
`The maiden would not look upon a
Moor with favor, Alfonzo.'
`But if the Moor looks upon her with
favor, he will, perhaps, wish to possess
her. Is there not at this moment many a
beautiful Spanish girl an inmate of the
harems of the Moslem invader? It will
be no new thing. If this prince fancies
her, he will strive to possess her; got no
Andalusian maid is safe in her father's
house from the licentious power of these
accursed conquerors of Christendom. The
quiet of our hamlet would be disturbed
with the tramp of Moorish feet, and the
Blood of my friends and I would flow in
the defence of our homes.'
`I see that thou art wise, and bast
judicious
forsight. I can anticipate all
horrors that you have named, my
son. I would hasten, therefore, this
guest away by night. The potion he hath
now, taken will keep him asleep till past
noon. He will then awake stronger, and
by the aid of a litter can be taken to the
house of Ben Osmin.'
`Not there, father!' cried Alfonzo,
quickly.
`Why not? There is a daughter of
his race to nurse him; and the Moorish
maidens are famed for their skill in
medicine
.
He can there remain till his
friends come for him.'
`No, no, father. It is too near us. If
he remove at all, it must be to Cordova.
Canst thou not give him a strong draught
when he wakes that will lend him two or
three hours' strength to enable him to
reach Cardova?'
`I know a powerful stimulant will do
this, son.'
`Then administer it, father.'
`I will do so. Xariffa must not be
perilled by his presence here longer than
is needful. I trust the maiden hath not
been seen by him.'
`No, I hope not, father. She has seen
him but he slept.'
`Advise her to keep her room till he
has departed; or instead of a blessing to
the hamlet, her beauty will bring a curse
upon it. The Moor must not see her.'
`Whither goest thou now, father?'
`To my cell, for a time. I shall
return
soon after noon, and when he awakes,
will administer to him that which will endue
him with false strength for a few
hours; but it will be at the expense of
greater weakness afterwards.'
`If he die it were better, than that he
should see and desire my beautiful sister
for his harem. I know, arid all men
know, that every fair maiden of Andalusia
is looked upon by the Moor as his own;
and I would not wish to have a party
come hither with the intent to bear away
Xariffa to Cordova to the Seraglio of this
fierce Emir; for I well know the
Infidel race. He would not hesitate to
repay my hospitality by rapine and the
sword. I will let my bird out, father,
and go up the mountain with thee. Hast
thou broken thy fast, for here I have in
my pouch bread and dried meat enough
for me and thee.'
`I Thank thee, my son. I will eat a
little while thou art letting out the
gazelles
.
Has Gaspar gone to the hills?'
`I saw him as I came out of the door
already upon the path going up the
gorge.'
`The gazelle-keeper opened the gate
of his fold, led them to water by the brook
side and then turned them into the hill
path up which Ban guided them.
Alfonzo
having asked of the hermit if there
was no danger of the Moor's waking
before
noon, attended him up the steep
path-way towards his cell, intending by
mid-day to leave his flock with Ban and
a herd-boy of one of his neighbours and
return to look after the Moor, resolved
not to leave him until he saw him far on
his way out of the hamlet.
His anxiety for the safety of Xariffia
was well founded; not that the maiden
would be likely to look favorably upon
an Infldel, however handsome and
attractive
,
but the Saracen had added to his
conquest of Andalusia a claim upon its
fairest maidens to fill his harem. A
daughter's beauty had in hundreds of
instances
lost the father his head or the
brother his life. The Seraglios of
Cordova
were tenanted only by Andalusian
females, torn by the scymetar of the
Saracen
from the sacred shelter of their
homes; and daily these things were done.
Reason, therefore, had the young
mountaineer to tremble for his sister if
the young Emir should once behold her.
CHAPTER XX.
THE DIAMOND.
We
now return to the cabin of the
herdsman and watch the progress of
events therein after the departure of
Gaspar in search of the wolf which the
Moor had slain, and of Alfonzo and the
hermit to the mountain.
The Saracen still lay as they had left
him buried in deep repose induced by
the medicinal draught which he had
taken from the hands of the monk. He
had taken it with an air of mingled trust
and suspicion, but being weak and his
mind a little confused and irresolute, he
had drank it off in silence. Offered by
the hand of Gaspar he would have
rejected
it; but there was something in the
venerable aspect of the hermit that led
him to believe, or at least hope that he
intended him good and not evil.
After the departure of the three men
the door opened from the inner room and
an old brown-visaged female stole softly
in. It was Teresa the wife of Pablo the
hireling. She was dressed in a dark
blue gown of coarse material, looped up
at the side to her girdle; and upon her
black locks, sprinkled with grey, she
wore a red cotton cap with lappets over
the cars, and tied beneath her skinny
throat. She was full fifty, tawny as an
Indian, and yet with an appearance of
having once possessed youthful beauty;
for her figure was still symmetrical and
her dark eyes were bright and in
themselves
handsome. She held in her hand
her rosary, at the ring upon which was
appended a little cross.
This woman had been commanded by
Alfonzo to watch his guest, and also to
keep silence, should he wake, touching
the presence in the house of the fair
Xariffa
.
All this the dame promised; and
after having passed a few minutes in the
room with the maiden, to assist her in
making her neat rustic toilet, she
proceeded
,
armed with her rosary, to the
post assigned her.
The old nurse did not like to be left
alone in a room with an Infidel, even
though he were asleep. She had heard
strange and marvellous tales of Moorish
necromancy; and it was her religious
belief
,
that every Saracen was a son of
Sathanas. She, therefore, left ajar the
door, so that, in case she should see any
evil spirits appear about the bed of the
unbeliever, she could secure for herself a
prompt escape from the scene of danger.
She now counted her rosary, and
muttering
an
ave
at every bead, took courage
and walked towards the couch of
wolf-skins
on which the stranger lay, with a
bag of heather for a pillow. The room
had been darkened by the hermit, but
light enough stole in through one of the
windows to enable her to have a good
view of the patient's features. Teresa
had seen many a Moor at a distance, and
wide awake with scymetars in their hands;
but she was then too much frightened to
look at them with attention;but a Moor
asleep and unarmed, was comparatively
harmless, and she resolved to have a good
look at him.
The gloom of the large room did not
please her at all; it looked too much as
if the dark corners might hide scores or
two of little imps of Eblis; so she
approached
the lattice and put back the old
baragan of Gaspar's with which it was
temporarily curtained, and so let the
broad, cheerful sun-light into the
apartment
and across the person of the Moor.
The sight of the sun-beams gave Teresa
more confidence, for she knew that evil
beings feared the light of day. She now
went close to the couch of the sleeper,
and gazed upon him with mingled
curiosity
and awe.
`Ave Maria! but he is a proper youth.
How handsome his nose is; and then he
has a mouth just like a baby's, only it has
a moustache on it, which only makes it
the manlier! The blessed Virgin keep
my soul! but he is for all the world like
any Christian. See his dark curling hair
and eye-brows, as even as the new moon.
His hands!Jesu Maria!they are as
delicate as Signora Xariffa's; and how
they sparkle with rings! That large
stone must be a diamond at the least; it
is like white fire blazing. How much I
wonder did it cost? What a pity for a
Moor to have such handsome jewels; and
such silks to dress in, and velvet bands
on his wrists. I never in my born days
saw a diamond shine afore! I've heard
the folk say they give light in the dark:
I'd like to know if that's true. He sleeps
terrible soundif I could just slip it off
for a minute, I'd take it into the closet
and try it. I
would
like to see if the
story they tell about it is trueit looks as
if it would come off easy.'
Teresa, therefore, softly approximated
her thumb and finger to the ringa
brilliant
diamond that sparkled on his little
finger. The finger was exposed to her
touch, and the ring looked as if it bound
it loosely, as though loss of blood had
relaxed
the muscles and contracted the size
of the finger.
She, who a few moments before had
approached the couch only with her
rosary
in her hand, and with many fears,
impelled by female curiosity, was now
bending over the unconscious Infidel and
softly slipping the ring from his finger.
`How easy it came off,' she said with
congratulation; `if he had waked he
would have taken my head off as easy.
These Moors think nothing of taking folk's
heads off they say; but I hav'nt
disturbed
him, he is as sound as a mole. Now
I'll try it in the cupboard and see if it
shines in the dark; I'll not keep it three
minutes, and then put it brick again.
But it wouldn't be a sin or theft, being he
is a Moor, for me to keep it and not give
it back to him at all, only for the fuss and
swirl he'd make about it. So I'll put it
on again when I've done with it, though
I'm half a mind to keep it altogether.'
With these words the nurse crept
across the room, and opening a narrow
left that led behind the dresser into a sort
of a closet, she drew the door to after
her and disappeared. Whether there
any virtue in the ring, which went out
of the Moor on its being separated from
his finger, and of the loss of which he was
suddenly conscious, is a question that
cannot be satifactorily answered; but,
certain it is, that she had no sooner closed
the door behind her than he turned
himself upon his couch and then opened
his eyes and looked wildly about him.
His looks showed a consciousness of
knowing where he was; still he was not
wholly roused. He seemed making
efforts
to awake and throw off the artificial
sleep which had been imposed upon him
by the drug which the hermit had
administered
to him. But he failed, and
was sinking to sleep again when he
instinctively
sought for his ring upon his
finger. When he found that it was gone,
he again threw open his eyes and moved
his lips, as if making an effort to give
words to his surprise. At this moment
his eyes fell upon the door of the closet,
being cautiously re-opened by the old
nurse. She had satisfied herself that the
diamond shone in the dark, but as for
answering the purpose of a candle,
thought she, one candle was worth ten
such diamonds.
Instantly, upon seeing the door open
so mysteriously, the young Moor closed
in part his eyes; but closely watched
from underneath the lashes the
appearance
of the intruder. His sense of danger
tended greatly to quicken his intellect
into consciousness; and, by the time
dame Teresa had got out of the pantry
and closed and buttoned the door behind
her, he was observing silently and keenly
all her motions. Fear and suspicion
were more potent than any reactive
power in his drug, and the potent spell of
the monk's medicine was dissolved and
null.
Old Teresa, with the diamond in her
hand, stood looking towards the bed and
evidently deliberating whether she ought
to return it to the unbeliever or not. She
had certain vague ideas in her old head
that a small diamond was of more value
than much gold, and she thought that it
was no more than right that she would
keep it from the Moor, who, thought she,
had no doubt got it by robbery.
`He shall not have it again,' she at
length said very positively. `At least I
will take it in and show it to Signora. It
is no sin to spoil the Egyptians, and they
say these Moors came from Egypt. I
think it would be more wicked to give it
back to him again than to keep it. But
I will show it to Signora. She would
like to see it shining in the dark. If she
says I must give it back, I will; but
when I talk to her a little, I know she
will keep it.'
With this resolution the old dame,
without taking another look at her
patient
,
went out through the door which
led to the apartment occupied by Xariffa.
She found the maiden engaged in
weaving
with two hand shuttles a piece of
netting for the head. She looked up on
seeing her enter, and said, with a smile,
`How is it, Teresa, you come away
so soon from your patient? I hope he
has not waked up!'
'No, Signora, he sleeps for all the
world just like a babe a month old,'
answered
the crone. `He is the sweetest
youth for a Moor that ever woman laid
eyes on. It is good for some eyes to
have a good look of his pretty face.Only that
he is a Hommadoun, I should never wish to see
a properer young man.'
`I know he is very handsome, Teresa;
and I believe, too, that he is as wicked as
he is handsome.'
`He can't be!'
`I have seen him. I fear him.
Perhaps
it is because I know him to be a
Saracen; but noble looking as he is,
there is something in his features that is
unpleasant. But what is that thou hast
there?'
`Don't be angry, Signora, for he is
only a son of Sathanas, and if I had
robbed
and murdered him outright, it would
have been doing God service.'
`Let me see what it is. Open thy
hand. What! a ring?'
`A diamond, nothing less; and shines
in the dark like a glow-worm. It would
take a rosary of 'em to make a light as
bright as a rezin taper; but they are
very pretty, and then don't burn out,
which is a great saving, if one only had
one big enough.'
`Where did you get this, woman?'
asked Xariffa, with angry surprise.
`I just slipped it off the Hommadoun's
little finger. He was sound, and is never
the wiser.'
`Robbed him?'
`No, Xariffa. I heard diamonds shined
in the dark; so I took it off as I saw it
was on loose, to carry it into the closet
to see.'
`And did it?'
`Yes, as I said, like a glow-worm.'
`And why did you come to me with
it? Why did you take it off, or after
having been guilty of this folly, why did
you not at once replace it!'
`What good will it do to him? He
has more, and is rich. We are poor, and
it is no sin to keep it. He is an
Egyptian
,
and we are bound to spoil the
Egyptians
.'
`Take it back at once. Wouldst thou
rob a guest of my father's house, woman,
and he a wounded youth. If you despise
him because he is a Moslem, you should
do him good because thou art a
Christian
.
Return quickly, and, without
waking
him, replace it upon his finger. The
Virgin protect me! The Moor!' she
cried, rising and retreating with surprise
and fear, as she beheld the tall, noble
figure of the stranger in the door of her
room.
CHAPTER XXI.
THE NET-WORKER.
The
young Moor, on seeing the old
Andalusian nurse leave the closet and
then glide from the room, suspected that
she was the person who had taken his
missing diamond. He, therefore
resolved
to follow-overtake her, and recover
it; for it was of inestimable value. His
desire to regain possession of it infused
into him new strength; and his sleep had
also greatly invigorated him. He was
able, therefore, to rise with some activity
from the couch of wolf-skins, on which
he had been so long laying, and taking a
scymetar from the wall, one of Alfonzo's
trophies, he leaned upon it and hastened
after the woman. He advanced
cautiously
and with a wary glance around him,
for he knew not what enemies he might
encounter. He passed through the
narrow
passage, and all at once came upon
Teresa and the maiden. He stood still
within a step of the door, transfixed with
admiring surprise at beholding such
beauty in so wild a mountain spot.
Xariffa was, at the moment he
discovered
her, censuring the old woman severely
for taking the diamond, and commanding
her to return it. Her side-face was
turned
towards him, although she did not at
first see him, thus giving him a good
opportunity
both to contemplate her charms
and to listen to her words. The dark
shining hair waving over a brow and
shoulders of exquisite womanly beauty;
the gazelle-like eyes; the superb bust
and shapely hand, he felt had never been
equalled. There was a spirit and glance
in her eye as she reproved the old nurse,
that heightened the glow of her beauty.
She was simply attired in a brown
bernish
,
a blue linen sash, confining it at
the slender waist, and she wore a green
net-cap upon her head, to bind up the
tresses. A native elegance, a sweet
rustic
grace, were embodied in her form,
and around her beauty had thrown a
charm that captivated and bewildered the
youthful Emir.
Upon seeing that he was discovered,
he stepped forward and said, with
Oriental
courtesy and flattery
`I thought I had been lost in the
mountains
;
but I find that having discovered
a stray
houri
, that Paradise cannot be far
off! Allah has heard my prayer. I
behold in the body the angel of my
dream!'
`Signor,' said Xariffa, blushing at this
compliment to her beauty; `I thought
you were sleepingthat is, too ill with
your wound to walk.' Xariffa said this
with hesitation and great confusion, and
alarm; for his appearance had
completely
taken her by surprise. Yet there
was in his looks nothing to fear, at least
so her heart whispered to her, as she
gazed a second time upon him. His
noble figure, elegantly attired, though
his costume was somowhat disarranged,
his handsome, pale features; his large
fine eyes, beaming upon her with
mingled
admiration and passion; the calm
repose of his whole attitude, as he leaned
for support upon the hilt of the scymetar
all spoke in his favor.
Teresa who had seen him at the same
time that Xariffa discovered him, had
instantly sunk upon her knees and began
to tell her beads, and to cry for mercy
in the name both of the Virgin and of
the mother of Mahomet. The Moor took
no further notice of her, more than to
point with his hand to the door, and
simply to say
`Go!'
She gladly sprung to her feet, and fled
from his presence. Xariffa called to her
to remain, trembling at the thought that
she should he alone with the Moor, but
Teresa was deaf.
`Fear not, Signora! I come not as
your foe, but as your guest I am here.
As I slept, the ring you hold in your
hand, was taken from my finger. I
awoke and saw the woman who has now
fled in such terror, quit my room; and I
rose to follow her, as I suspected her.
She led me hither! I heard your reproof
and your command for her to return it!
For this accept my thanks!'
`I need them not, Signor Saracen!'
answered Xariffa, embarrassed. `Take
the ring, sir; I am sorry the nurse took
it; but I believe it was more from
curiosity
to test its quality of emitting light in
darkness, than from a desire to rob you
of it; yet, upon getting possession of it,
her cupidity got the better of her honesty.
I pray you forgive her, and receive the
diamond.'
`Noit is yours, fair Christian maid,'
answered the young man, taking it from
her to place it upon her finger.
`No, no, Signor,' she quickly said,
removing
it with a shudder. `I cannot
take it.'
`Thou art too cruel, maiden, to
disdain
my gift. I owe this courtesy, for I
am thy guest.'
`My father's and brother's.'
`So; these two men are father and
brother to thee,' repeated the Moor, as
he seated himself upon a settle near the
door. `I am still weak and must rest
while I talk with thee.'
`Hadst thou better not return, Signor,
to thy couch. Thy face is pale and'
`Nay, maiden, I shall be better here,'
he answered with a smile, bending at the
same time his piercing black eyes upon
her face. `I shall do better with so fair
a leech as thyself, than under the care of
the old man who hath dragged me so
heavily. I am still heavy with the sleepy
power of his potions. What is thy name?'
`Xariffa, Signor,' answered the
maiden
,
with blushing confusion at his bold,
free inquiry. `But I pray thee, Signor,
stay not here. Thou art imprudent.'
`To trust myself within the influence
of eyes so burning as thine. I grant it.
But do not fly me. I shall not let thee
pass me to the door. See, my scymetar
debars thy passage out. Thou art
my-prisoner
,
sweet bird of the mountain;' he
said, as he snugly placed his sword across
the open door, pressing the point deep
into the wooden post. `Sit down, I pray
thee, and resume thy netting. I love to
look at fair fingers nimbly plying the
shuttle
bow. Thou hast both skill and taste.
maiden,' he added, taking up a corner of
the web which she had been making, and
examining the work. `With silk for thy
woof, instead of this coarse hempen fibre,
it would be a scarf worthy to adorn a
Princess. Come and sit here and go on
with thy pretty toil.'
`Nay, Signor. I implore thee to
retire
.
If my fathermy brother'
`Well, what would they do? I honor
them in noticing thee, the Christian dogs.'
`Moor, thou dost forget that thou
owest to them thy life and present
hospice
.
Is it by insult the followers Islam
return hospitality.
The cheek of the young Emir
coloured
highly, and although he smiled, he
looked as if deeply displeased, and
touched
by her reproof.
`Thou shouldst not have threatened
me with thy father and brother,' he
answered
haughtily.
`I did not menace thee; I begged thee
to go. They would be sorryangry to
find that thou hadst taken advantage of
their absence to over-step the license of
a guest to intrude into my private room.'
`Private room! Allah be gracious.
Thou lookest as if thou wert a princess,
and these rough walls a palace.
`It is my palace, my lord,' she
answered
proudly. 'It is my home, lowly
though it be.'
`It is no fit home, maiden, for beauty
like thine to hide itself in. Thy name is
Xariffa; a fair flower, but thou art fairer
than the flower after which thou art
called
.
Come, go on with thy netting,'
and as he spoke he took her hand and
would have drawn her to the seat, but
she escaped its hold and stood, as before,
at the extremity of the apartment looking,
both angry and alarmed, while she
wondered
at the cool audacity and
impudence
of the young Saracen.
`I command thee,' she said with firm
displeasure, her fine eyes flashing at the
insult of his intrusive presence, I
command
thee to leave me!'
`Maiden, I pray thee forgive me,' he
said, suddenly kneeling and assuming an
air of deep contrition. `I have but been
testing thy spirit and forbearance. I see
that thou art as proudly souled as
beautiful
in body! I will no longer force
myself upon your society. I obey, and
will leave thee; but I pray thee first let
me remain a moment or two for further
repose. My wound still troubles me,
and I am not so strong as I believed.
Allow
me to sit here till I recover a little.
I will not disturb thee. I will not even
look upon thy sunny face. See! I have
removed my scymetar from the door, so
that thou art free to go or stay! But
i
thou wilt remain and proceed with thy
work and forget me, I will depart. Thou
knowest I should not have come hither
but for the theft of my ring by the
woman
who left my room.'
`I know it, Signor. I am sorry she
was guilty of this.'
`I know thou art. I heard thee nobly
reprove her. Those few words showed
me thy high spirit and honorable feeling.
Wilt thou still firmly refuse the ring?' he
asked, beaming upon her relenting
features
looks of tender appeal.
`I cannot take it, my lord. It becomes
not a maiden to accept so rich a gift from
a stranger, much less from an
Unbeliever
.
Ask me no more!'
`Be it so. I will press thee no further.
To thy pretty task again. There! That
is generous! Now I will sit here and
watch thee in silence. Thou wilt forget
I am here!'
`I would rather thou shouldst go,
Signor
!'
answered Xariffa, as she re-seated
herself, with a hesitating, timid air, to her
task of netting.
`Wouldst thou send me away from thee
to that dark old room, to be alone ? I
shall, each moment, grow better here!
The sun of thy eyes will warm my blood
and '
`No more, Signor. Thou didst pledge
thy word to keep silent, if I permitted
thee to remain.'
`Then thou dost permit it. Thanks!'
he said, with looks of delight.
`I cannot permit where one will or
no!' she answered, with a smile playing
about her beautiful mouth as she bit into
the thread of her work and then
proceeded
to knot and weave it.
She was not perfectly at her ease in
so dangerous a presence; yet she had
far more confidence in him than at the
outset. Still she felt like a lamb who
finds itself unexpectedly the guest of a
lion, and finds that it must make the best
of his critical situation. There was
something
in the
degagee
air of the handsome
young Saracen that amused her, and
qualified greatly her fear of him. There
was also something in his looks, his
manner
when he spoke to her, in the tones of
his voice, that struck her as pleasing.
She knew that he was a very dangerous
person, and her brother's warning words
came vividly to her mind. But still he
did not look so very dangerous. And
then he had apologised so handsomely;
and removed so pleasantly the scymetar
from the door-way! And then sat so
quietly and submissively, as if he was
resolved
by docility to atone for his previous
boldness.
She, therefore, resumed, timidly
indeed
,
her netting; yet she trembled lest
some accident should bring her brother
back from the hills before noon; or for
fear her father should come suddenly in
and find his guest in his lamb's fold.
These thoughts troubled her; and what
too with the dark eyes of the young Emir
fixed upon her, and watching every
movement of her trembling fingers, it is
not surprising that she dropped almost
every third stitch in her web, and made,
altogether, in the five minutes space only
that she tried to net upon it before him,
a very bungling piece of work of it.
CHAPTER XXII.
THE WOLF-KILLER
Xariffa
found that she could not
command
her self-possession sufficiently to
accomplish anything at her netting while
the dark eyes of the youthful infidel
were upon her. She became more and more
confused at his presence. As a Christian
she felt that it was very wrong to remain
a moment in the company of so wicked
a person as a Mussleman. Nothing but
his manly beauty could have reconciled
her to her forced stay in the room.
Suddenly throwing down her work, she
rose up and said, between a smile and
a frown of real annoyance,
`I can do nothing, Signor; I pray you,
if you are rested, leave me.'
`I obey, maiden,' answered the Moor,
with ready reply; `I would not anger
thee on my account; I see that my
longer
remaining will displease thee;but
first tell me if I can hope that one day I
shall see thee in Cordova?'
`I have never been in the city, Signor.
It is too dangerous a place for a Christian
maiden.'
`Thou hast heard only foolish rumors,
brought by the peasants. I assure thee
that Cordova is only second to the City
of Paradise; it abounds in palaces of
marble, in beautiful gardens, in
fountains
;
in noble youths and fair dames;
and mirth and music reign joyous there.
Thou must come to Cordova.'
`When the cross replaces the crescent
upon its temples, and a Christian prince
sits in its royal palace, instead of the
usurping Emirs, I will visit Cordova,
Signor
!'
`Thy words ring, maiden,' said the
Moor, with a quick color, and an angry
light in his eye, which, however, he
instantly
subdued. `Thou hast spoken of
a day that will never return. The Emirs,
indeed, will not long reign, I think, in
Cordova; but there will be one Caliph
instead.'
`And who is he? Have not thy
people
thrown off allegiance to the great
Sultan of the East?'
`I speak of no Caliph sent from
Damascus
,
but one among us!' answered
the young man proudly. `Thou
knowest
that now Cordova is governedsince
we declared ourselves free from the
Caliphate
of Syriaby a Council of Emirs.'
`And they rule not in concord, I hear,
Signor. Daily we look for an outbreak,
as the principal Emirs among them
aspire
to reign alone. I have heard that
the young Emir, Abdelasis, the son
o
the Emir Mahomad, who was slain last
year, is the most powerful of these, though
he rules not with the Council.'
`Then thou hast heard of Abdelasis?'
`Only that he is rich and ambitious,
and has many friends. My father said
that the Council of Emirs feared him more
than they did each other.'
`Ha! has news of our city matters
penetrated even here, maiden?' said the
Moor, with surprise on his countenance.
`The peasants know more than we
ourselves
.
There has been, within a few
days past, some talk of such matters as
you speak of, and it may be that
Abdelasis
may succeed, but it remains to be
tried. He is closely watched by the
Emirs, since a rumor got out a few days
back that he might aspire to the
Caliphate
;
for one resolute man, with a few
fast friends, would do more than a score
of jealous and quarrelling Emirs, each
fearing the other, and, in their disunion,
become powerless. I had not believed
the movements in the town were so well
reported here.'
`We take a deep interest in all that
passes among our conquerors, Signor.
It may be that, by and by, taking
advantage
of your dissensions, we may regain
our city and province!'
`By the sword of the Prophet! thou
art a bold maiden! thy speech tells!
Do all Christian maids feel this interest
in their country?'
`Else they were unworthy the love
of Christian youths, Signor! We all
weep and pray daily for our beloved
land. Spain has fallen; but she will rise
again. The holy hermit, who dressed
thy wound, says that this calamity hath
befallen the land for its sins. It may be
so! We are deeply penitent now, and
I trust that Heaven will yet accept our
penitence and once more raise up a
prince and leader among us.'
`By the soul of the Prophet! I did
not know such a spirit dwelt in the
mountains!' cried the Saracen. `If the
sister speaks and feels thus how must the
brother and father feel and speak! If
the maidens of the conquered land are
moved to such eloquence and lofty spirit,
how must the men of the country be
effected
.
With such a feeling abroad in
the land, Spain is not conquered!'
`Thou hast confessed it, Moor. Spain
is not conquered. The crescent rules
over the soil, but not over the soul of
Andalusia
.'
The more I listen to thee, the more
thou pleasest me, for thy very spirit! I
have never before beheld a woman like
thee. Thou canst think and speak for
thyself. Beautiful and wise maiden,
listen to me, Moor though I am. I love
thee. My heart is taken by thy beauty,
but less by thy beauty than thy spirit.
For thy sake I would almost become a
Christian!'
`Thou wouldst never be a Christian, if
only for my sake. Christianity receives
none but those who come for Christ's
sake, and that they may be saved. Thy
words displease me, Signor. Yet I would
that not only thou but all thy people
were true believers and heirs of promises
given to thy father Abraham!'
`Perhaps, if thou couldst favor my
love, maiden, thou mightest teach mel
the truth. I could sit at thy feet and
listen
to thy teachings forever, so that I
could have the privilege, as I listened, of
gazing up into thy dark eyes.'
`Thy speech is blasphemy; for it
mingles earthly passion with heavenly
love. I cannot hear thee, Signor. In
professiug to love me, thou art mocking
me. Wilt thou depart, or let me?'
`Nay, I will not detain thee! Never
was wooer treated so coldly. I could
envy the Christian goat-herd on whom
thy smile would light! If thou wilt
return
my love, I swear to thee, by Allah,
maiden, that I will become a Christian.'
`I wish that thou wert a follower of
the Prophet of Nazareth, Signor, but I
cannot sacrifice myself to make thee one.
I cannot trust to faith pledged by a
Moslem
oath. Thou mightest deceive me
and profess to be a Christian, but I know
that none but God can give thee a new
heart!'
The youthful Moor frowned and
seemed
to be displeased at her words. There
was a treacherous light in his eye that
showed he meant to deceive the pure
girl; for Moors kept no faith with
Christians
.
`Thou art a pretty preacher, fair
Xariffa!' he answered; `but I will not
make thee angry by any words for those
thou hast given me. I will go and try to
forget thee! Farewell!'
With these words the young Moor
slowly retired, bending upon her looks of
mingled reproach and tenderness. As
soon as she saw that he had disappeared
she raised her eyes from the floor, for
she had not looked up to meet his gaze,
and with a feeling of relief secured the
fastening of her door and resumed her
netting. But her fingers were trembling
too much for her to accomplish any
thing; and her thoughts too much
agitated
to give her mind to her task. So she
threw it aside and rose up and walked
the room. She re-called every
circumstance
of the interview, just terminated.
At one moment she condemned at another
approved of her conduct. That she felt
flattered by his admiration of her beauty
is not to be denied, and to be told by so
handsome a youth, Infidel though he
were, that he loved her disturbed not a
little the usual tranquillity of her bosom.
She felt that she could never love him
under any circumstances, even as a
Christian, were he to become one!
There was something in his face that
was unpleasant, and marred, like a flaw
in a diamond, its moral beauty.
`I But why should I think about or let
my mind dwell for a moment upon him?'
she said suddenly. I He is an Infidel,
and it becomes not a Christian maiden to
think upon an unbeliever. I am happy
that he has left me. I feel as if I had
escaped
from some great peril. Handsome
he is; but it is the beauty of a fallen
angel
.
How can the sons of the spirit
Sathanas
have other than that evil light in
the eye which sparkled balefully amid
the glory of his glance. Glad, indeed,
I am that he has returned to his room
before my father and Alfonzo came and
discovered him. I tremble at the very
idea of such a meeting. My brother
would have slain him, had he found him
here. But why does my heart so
suddenly
sink? Is there evil still to come
to me from this interview? I pray the
Virgin to watch over me. But my
brother's
words of warning ring in my ears.
Yet I am not to blame. He sought my
room in pursuit of Teresaluckless
Teresa
,
who always brings mischief
where-ever
she goes. Alfonzo cannot censure
me. Yet I will keep it from him, and
Teresa shall be commanded to preserve
silence, which she will gladly do, as the
price of secresy about the theft of the
diamond. I fear nothing, the more I
think upon him. He will go away and
forget me, as he said he would. I would
that my brother were here, or my
father
!'
`Thou hast thy wish child,' said the
voice of Gaspar, as he passed by her
window, with the skins of two wolves
hanging over his shoulder, and his dress
wild and disordered, as if he had been
combatting with the animals.
`What do you wish for me girl?'
he asked kindly but roughly, as his
manner
was; and as he spoke he leaned
upon
the sill of the window.
`I hear the Moor up, sir.'
`Ah, then I am back in time! The
hermit's potion was not so potent as he
supposed. I found the wolf which he
had wounded. It was laying in a crevice
of the cliff with the broken spear
sticking
in his shoulder, and, as you see, had
nearly gnawed it up in endeavoring to
draw it from the wouud in his broken
shoulder-blade. He resisted fiercely, but
I slew him, and here is his skln. The
other is the hide of a wolf that I followed
last night to his lair, and this morning
attacked
him in it; and after some
scratches
,
as you see, killed him and took his
coat from him. They were both of the
largest size, and one of them has five
old wounds in his hide. The Moor will
be glad to see the skin of his enemy. I
will take it to him. I am glad he is up,
for we will the sooner get rid of him; I
ike not these Infidels too well at a
distance
;
much less beneath my own roof.
But the father would have it that a
Christian
ought to show hospitality to his foe,
giving me Scripture for it. If the devil
made a call upon the good father in his
cell, I have no doubt he would treat him
civilly with the best he had. But I must
see the Moor.'
Thus saying, Gaspar left the window
and passed round the corner of the cabin
and entered the room where the young
Saracen was engaged in examining the
heavy scymetar which had once
belonged
to the Ethiopian of El Zegris. Upon
seeing Gaspar enter, he stepped back
with an attitude of hostile inquiry; for
the appearance of the wolf-killer was
wild and savage, with his gory skins
dripping from his shoulder, his rough
mountain costume, and the spears in his
hand. But he at once recognized him
as his host, though he had before seen
him but for a moment, and dropping the
point of the scymetar, he gazed upon
him with surprise and curiosity.
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE QUARREL.
The
wolf-slayer at first looked at his
guest with some show of hostility, seeing
him armed with the scymetar of the
Ethiopian
;
but a second glance showed him
that he was only examining it; he
therefore
dropped the point of his spear, and
said as he entered,
`I hardly knew whether to meet thee
with words or steel, sir Moor. I am glad
thou art well up again. There is great
virtue in the monk's medicaments, as I
know well, having had to call on him
many a time to heal a hurt from a wolf's
fang or claws. How fares it with thee?'
`I feel strong again, though I have lost
much blood, and shall hardly be myself
fully for some day or two; I am well
enough to return to Cordova, if thou canst
get me a horse, peasant.'
`A horse? there is not one owned in
the Sierras. You Moors have all the
horses; by chance a mule may be found
nothing better.'
`Dost thou intend to keep me here?'
`No; I shall be right glad when thou
art safe in Cordova.'
`Then wilt thou go and find on the
plain some Moor, and send him hither
with a horse for me?'
`I can do nothing without father
Godfrey
.
It is now approaching noon, and
he will soon be here. I will see what he
says: besides, he can give thee
something
will strengthen thee.'
`How camest thou by this scymetar?'
`That is not mineit is Alfonzo's.'
`Alfonzo! What, the Destroyer?'
`Yes.'
`Where is that hero of your Sierras?
I have heard much of himwhere dwells
he?'
`Not far off, Signor,' answered
Gaspar
,
who had it on his tongue to answer
that he was then in his cabin; but he
feared that the Moor might some day
hatch mischief against him out of the
intelligence
;
and so he withheld the proud
boast of his being his son.
`I would give much to behold him.
Hast thou seen him?'
`Yes.'
`What stature is he?'
`Talleven a couple of inches above
thy own height, sir Moor: and thou hast
a truly knightly bearing of thy own.'
`How camest thou by this ponderous
sword? Does he wield it?if so, he is
a giant.'
`No, he carries only a wolf's spear.
He loves no better than I the Saracen
weapon; yet he can use it on occasion,
as well as I. That scymetar was taken
by him from a huge Ethiopian, whom he
slew when he maimed El Zegrishast
thou heard of that?'
`What man in the valley of Andalusia
is ignorant of the exploit? It is a
ponderous
sword! Dost he know that El
Zegris thirsts for his blood?'
`Does the robber live?'
`Yes, and is captain of a body of rebel
Zenetan horse, that lay imposts upon all
travellers that cross the Vegas. He will
ride this way some day in search of his
foe. I would give much to see this
Alfonzo
;where
is he now?'
`Doubtless with his herd upon the
hills.'
`Is he still a herdsman? a warrior like
he?' exclaimed the Moor with surprise.
`He takes no merit for his deeds,
Signor
;
he is like all brave men, modest.
Spain speaks of him as a hero, while he
only regards himself as a humble
gazelle-tender
.'
`He must be an extraordinary man.
Whose other armor and arms are these?
They are Moorish?
`Yes; they were taken from their
ownners
in fair battle a score of years ago.
Thou seest that narrow swordit was
Taric's, the Moorish conqueror!'
`Tarics!' exclaimed the Saracen with
surprise and admiration, taking it up.
`How came it here?'
`I struck it from his hand, and he only
was saved by his friends from being slain
by me; for I had this foot upon his
breast!'
`Thou?'
`Yes, Moor. Herdsman as you see
me now, I am of the best blood in Spain.
When Taric invaded our land, I was a
noble, at the head of a thousand retainers,
whom I led to the field. Heaven
ordained
that we should be defeated. Since
that disastrous day I have been a
mountaineer
!
Still I keep Taric's sword as a
trophy!'
`Thou shalt no longer have it to
beast
of, Christian!' answered the Moor. `It
is
mine!
'
`Thine, Moor! Give it to me!'
`Thou shalt no longer retain the sword
of the great Champion of Islam. It is a
shame to the children of the Prophet that
thou shouldst have it. Ask me no more
for it!'
`No, I will not ask thee for it,
Saracen
!'
cried Gaspar, throwing down the
skins and catching a scymetar from the
wall. `I will take it from thee, and with
it thy jewels! I am poor and thou art
rich, robber! Come, defend thyself?'
As Gaspar spoke these fierce words he
sprung towards him, his long hair
flowing
behind, giving him a wild and
extremely
fierce aspect. The Saracen
stepped back and prepared to defend with
the scymetar his possession of it, and in
another instant their swords would have
been clashing in mortal combat, when
Alfonzo suddenly stood between them
and interposed his person to their hostile
swords. The Saracen gazed with
surprise
upon the noble and commanding
air with which the tall mountaineer put
them asunder, his shepherd's long
bernish
falling back from his shoulders like
the drapery of a statue. Behind him
stood, leaning upon his long staff and
surveying the group, the majestic
whitebearded
figure of the hermit Godfrey.
`What means this, Saracen? How is
this, father?' demanded Alfonzo with
difficulty
keeping back the fierce
wolf-slayer
.
`Dost thou see that he has the
scymetar
of Taric in his grasp?' cried Gaspar.
`The holy father's potion hath given him
health, and, by the mass! he gets out of
his couch to rob me of my trophy. Stand
back, Alfonzo! I am to do battle with
him for both Taric's sword and his
jewels!'
`Not so, father!' answered Alfonzo.
`The Moor is entitled to my protection.
Give up the sword, Saracen! Thou seest
thy life is in danger.'
The Moor, with a dark frown, slowly
hung it upon the stag's horn from which
he had taken it, and then stood proudly
gazing upon Alfonzo and the monk.
`How long hast thou been up, Infidel?'
asked the hermit now coming forward as
Gaspar drew sullenly back, muttering
threats against the Moslem hound, as he
termed him.
`It is not long. I am glad thou art
come, for this fierce peasant would have
slain me, knowing I am still weak!'
`Thou hast provoked him to anger.
But I am glad to see thee well again.
Thy hurt was less deep than I believed.'
`Monk, I would go to Cordova at once,'
said the Moor in a tone of command. `I
asked this peasant for a horse, but he
would have me wait for thee. Now wilt
thou end thy hospitality by
accommodating
me.'
`We own no horses in the mountain,
Moor,' answered father Godfrey mildly;
for the tones in which the Moor spoke
were fiercely stern; and to such wise
men ever respond peacefully. `I will
have a mule for thee.'
`I will rather walk. How far is it to
the highest Moor's dwelling?'
At the Emir's tower, half a league
hence. But thou wilt not find there Ben
Osmin, for doubtless he hath gone to day
to Cordova,' answered the hermit. And
he has no horse. If thou couldst walk
a league, by slow steps, with the aid of
this young man, thou wilt reach the
Kassah
of Ali Hamet, the keeper of the
garden
of cucumbers. He hath steeds!'
`I know the place well. But I cannot
well walk. Send thy people to him for
a horse! Thou shalt have gold for thy trouble!'
`If thou wilt take my arm's aid, Moor
I will go with thee,' answered Alfonzo.
`I will see thee in safety to the abode of
this Ali Hamet!'
Alfonzo had not spoken since he had
separated from them, and the Moor now
looked on his form with admiration.
`Art thou a mountaineer?' he asked
of him, in that tone of command like
one who was in the habit of addressing
inferiors.
`I am,' quietly answered Alfonzo.
`Thou shouldst show thyself in
Cordova
.
Thy form would give thee a good
place under the Emir Abdelasis. He likes tall
men in his body-guard.'
`The Emir must find slaves, not
freemen
to serve him, Moor!' answered
Alfonso
.
`If thou art strong enough to
walk, I am ready to attend thee. Thou
shalt lean on my arm, when thy feet fail
thee!'
`The father can give him a stimulant
that will help him,' answered Gaspar,
sullenly. `In the Virgin's blessed name
give it him, holy father, and get the
mountain
free of him soon. My hand burns
to lay its weight upon the unbeliever!'
The Moor frowned vindictively upon
Gaspar, and then turning to the monk in
whom he seemed to have confidence, he
said
`Hast thou a strengthening draught,
Christian?'
`I will prepare it for thee,' answered
father Godfrey. He then filled a cup
with water, and took from his leathern
case a powder which he placed in the cup.
`Drink all of it, Moor. Thou wilt
find an hour's hard travel of it! It will
bring thee to the gates of Cordova.
Thou wilt scarce need the aid of the
young man here; still he shall go with
thee to protect thee against any of the
goatherdsmen that may cross thy path!'
`I need no protection against the base
herds,' answered the young man with
that bold courage which seemed to be a
prominent feature of his character.
`Yet he shall go with thee! It is our
duty, having given thee shelter to see
that our hospitality be carried out! Our
Prophet Christ teaches us to love our
enemies, and if they ask a cup of cold
water to give it to them! So have we
done to thee, Moor! Now, depart in
peace!'
The Saracen having taken off the
draught, seemed in a moment or two
afterwards to be revived by it. His eye
caught the brilliancy of health, his colour
became clearer, and his whole bearing
like a man who has suddenly invested
himself with strength as with a garment.
He strode proudly towards the door, and
said with haughty courtesy
`Thanks, Christians, for the shelter of
thy roof! If thou wilt show me the path
down into the valley, fair sir, I can then
go forward alone!' This last sentence
was addressed to Alfonso.
`Go with him my son!' said father
Godfrey.
`He is too overbearing for me to like
him well enough to be his companion,'
answered Alfonzo, `But I heed him
not. I will go with him.'
If I went with him, it would be to
lighten him of his jewels,' said Gaspar in
an under tone, `and perhaps he will find
a guide far more of the way than he
bargains for. I will follow on at a
distance
;
and when Alfonzo leaves him,
I will join him again, and we will then
finish our little affair just now
interrupted
!'
The Moor, preceded by Alfonzo,
armed
with his wolf-spear, which he never
went without, left the cabin and took his
way down the cliff-side towards the
valley
.
Ere they were fairly out of sight,
Gaspar followed, leaving the hermit
resting
in the hut.
CHAPTER XXIV.
THE MOORISH HORSEMEN
The
path down the side of the cataract
was precipitous and the Moor in his
descent
found it difficult to maintain his
footing, especially where the spray from
the bounding torrent had rendered the
rocks slippery, More than once he was
compelled to lay his grasp upon Alfonzo
to save himself from a plunge headlong
down the precipice, which the sure-footed
young gazelle-keeper trode with perfect,
safety.
At length they reached the foot of the
rocks
and struck into the forest path that
led directly across the beautiful plain in
the direction of Cordova. Upon getting a
first glimpse of the minorets of the city
from the path, the Moor stopped and
exclaimed
with delight,
`Allah be praised. I am once more
in sight of the temples of the true faith!
How far is it to Cordova, Christian?' he
asked, as Alfonzo walked on before him.
`Two leagues,' answered the
mountaineer
.
`It is nearly two miles from
this to the first Moorish abode. If thou
keepest on direct,' he added as he came
to a meeting of two roads, `thou wilt
not fail to find it.'
`What, art thou going back?' asked
the Moor.
`The road is plain before thee?'
`Yet I would rather thou shouldest go
with me a little farther; for I care not
to fall in with any of the herdsmen.
Here is gold.'
`They never come into the valley.
But I will go on with thee a little farther,
Moor. Put up thy gold, I do this from
hospitality not for reward. We are poor,
we are mountaineers, but we are not
so poor as to take Moorish gold. Thou
and thine are my county's foes; but I
war not against one of thy race who calls
for my hospitality, as has been the case
with thee.
`So thou wouldst not hesitate to have
attacked me, hadst thou encountered me
well.'
`Not unless thou hadst done me a
present wrong. Christians meet Moors
daily, and yet there is no fighting
between
them, save when the former would
resent a wrong.'
`And the time will yet come when
they will not dare even to resent a wrong.
There is too much liberty given thee and
thy people. Were I Caliph I would make
bondsmen of the mountaineers, as well as
of the inhabitants of the towns.'
`Thou art not Caliph, and so we are
free, proud Moor,' answered Alfonzo,
with a scornful curl of his lip. `The
mountaineer is not so easily enslaved.
Dost thou recollect that fifteen years ago,
when one of the Caliphs would have
made us bondsmen, how many of his
servants lost their lives in the defiles of
the Sierras! He found us then
unconquerable
,
and so wouldst thou. We are
born free, and to God only are we
servants
.
Art thou an Emir, for I know
thou art a Moor of rank?'
`I am a private citizen of Cordova,'
answered the Saracen, who did not care
to make known his rank and name, when
it might, as he feared, be fatal to him;
for it will be seen he was no friend to the
Spaniard; but rather, of all their foes, the
bitterest, as well as the most rich and
powerful. `What is thy name?'
`I fear not to speak it, though thou
fearest to give thine ownI am Alfonzo,
the goat-herd.'
`The Destroyer?' cried the Saracen,
who now recalled to mind the Ethiop's
scymetar, which he had found in the hut.
`Art thou the Alfonzo who cut off the
hand of the Zegris?' he added, stopping
full in the path, and fixing his gaze upon
him, as he waited his reply.
`I am Moor,' responded the young
mountaineer quietly, walking on as
before
.
`Then I have my wish, for I this day
told that fierce peasant who would have
attacked me, that I would give much to
behold thee.'
`Thou seest but a freeman, Moor.
The sight, I know, is rare in Cordova to
infidel eyes; but thou wilt find many in
the mountains.'
The Saracen remained standing still,
and surveying the mountaineer wilh
curiosity
and admiration.
`So! Thou art the brave man I have
heard so much of!' he at length said. `I
am glad we have met, or rather that I
knew who thou wert before we parted. I
believe thou art no friend to the
Saracen
!'
`No. I look upon the Saracen as
the enemy of God and of Christian
nations. Thy people have now the
power
in the land, but it will not be forever.
The crescent that now so proudly glitters
above the cross must be thrown down.
Heaven may have punished Spain for
her sins; but its wrath will yet be
poured
out upon the wicked children of the
Prophet, whose iniquities cry aloud to it
for its judgment.'
`Thou art a bold speaker, peasant!'
answered the Moor, reminded by his
words of Xariffa's ringing speech. `It is
such men as thyself that keep Spain in
commotion.'
`Would there were more of them,
Saracen
,'
answered Alfonzo. `But this is
no time for us to speak of Spain's wrongs
and thy oppression. I have conducted
thee now as far as I intended. From this
spot thou seest the palm-tree of Ali
Hamet
.
It will be a guide from which
thou canst not stray.'
`If thou wilt go on with me farther, I
will give thee a purse of gold.'
`No gold! I will go on if thou art a
coward. No herdsmen of the hills will
find thee here, Sir Moor.
The Saracen would have resented the
imputation of cowardice; but he had a
motive stronger than pride actuating his
purposes. He resolved, if it were
possible
,
to get the celebrated mountaineer
into
his hands. But he could not do it
singly. Alfonzo the Destroyer was too
formidable an opponent for one or two or
many Moors to overcome, if aware of
treachery. He therefore wished to
beguile
him onward to the house of Ali
Hamet. He hoped there to be able to
make him a captive; and through him to
bring the proud maiden, his sister, whom
he had seen and talked with in the
mountain
cabin, till he became deeply
impassioned
with her beauty,to bring the
beautiful Xariffa at his feet. He,
moreover
,
felt desirous of having in his hands
so powerful an enemy of the Moor, who
might yet become as formidable to the
Infidels as he had been te the robbers of
the mountain-wilds. He therefore said,
`I am not a coward, brave Alfonzo, in
my own city; but, by the hand of the
Prophet
!
I like not much these gloomy woods.
If some half score of Christian peasants
should meet me alone, my courage would
hardly save me.'
`I need not go farther with thee! for
yonder comes galloping a party of
Moorish
horse; doubtless some of thy own
troop coming in search of thee!'
The Moor looked up and beheld about
half a mile off a party of horsemen whom
by their turbans and white costume he
knew to be Saracens. As they came
rapidly nearer, he cried out with joy that
he distinguished his own banner in
advance
.
`I congratulate you, Moor,' said
Alfonzo
.
`I will now return, and hereafter
when thou findest a sick or wounded
Christian in need of hospitality,
remember
the kind treatment thou hast had at
the hands of Alfonzo, the herdsman's
son.'
`Stay. I wonld make thee a costly
gift,' said the Moor.
`No; I do not care to trust myself
with thy people. Fare thee well, Moor.'
With this parting salutation, Alfonzo
turned to hasten into the narrow footpath
to avoid the cavalcade, which consisted
of at least eighteen horsemen, glittering
in gold and silks and precious stones, and
formidable with steel.
`They shall not harm thee. I will see
that thou art rewarded by them rather
than injured. They will hail thee as my
deliverer when they are told what thou
hast done for me.'
Alfonzo knew that it was dangerous
for a Christian to trust a Moor; yet he
believed that his guest would prove
faithful
to his word. He, therefore, stood
boldly; for the horsemen came on so
fast that, without fairly fleeing with speed
of foot, he could not readily escape them
should they pursue. So he remained,
resolved to confide in the honor of the
Moor.
The next instant the gorgeously
arrayed
troop came close at hand, and the
leader reining up on recognising his chief,
leaped from his horse and, approaching
him, shouted,
`Allah be praised! my lord Abdelasis
is safe!'
`Allah il Allah! God is great!'
shouted
his troop, on beholding the young
Emir.
`We rejoice to see you, my lord,' said
the lieutenant, embracing and kissing
him. `We heard that thou wert safe in
some of the mountain cabins, and I have
come out on purpose to search for thee
thoroughly. Thy absence so suddenly
on the Sierras yesterday has filled us all
with grief and alarm for your fate.
Every search was made for you. But
you look pale!'
`I was drawn away from you in
pursuit
of a monstrous wolf; I was not aware
how far I pursued. I at length came up
with him and wounded him in a fierce
combat; but he tore my side with his
paw, and I found shelter in the cabin of
a mountaineer.'
`Who is this Christian?'
`Thy prisoner, Osmen. Seize and bind
him!' cried the treacherous Saracen, as
he saw four of the horsemen were within
five feet of the young mountaineer.
Scarcely had he spoken when Alfonzo,
amazed, sprung backward, and presented
his spear to defend himself; Osmen, the
lieutenant of the Moors, leaped towards
him, and Alfonzo struck his scymetar to
the ground with a single blow, and still
retreated; the rest pressed upon him
fiercely.
`Let him not escape for your lives!
He is Alfonzo the Destroyer!' shouted
the false Moor. `Down with himbut
slay him not.'
No sooner had the four Moors heard
this well-known name, than, as if by one
impulse, they drew back, as if a chasm
had opened before them. The dreaded
name, instead of inspiring them with
valor
,
intimidated them. They were afraid
to attempt, alone, to arrest so formidable
an opponent: they waited for their
companions
to come to their aid, and then to
overwhelm him by the power of numbers.
In the mean while, Alfonzo steadily
retreated
towards the forest, facing his
foes. Seeing this, the treacherous
Abdelasis
leaped into one of the saddles, and
seizing a scymetar galloped towards him.
Alfonzo received the horse upon the
point of his spear, the weapon entering
deep into his chest; the animal reared
and fell dead, and Abdelasis rolled over
upon the ground. He was saved from
instant death from his own scymetar,
which Alfonzo had grasped, by the
interposition
of his followers; who, seeing
heir chief down, rode on with fierce
cries to attack the formidable
mountaineer
.
Alfonzo would have been
surrounded
and cut down, valiantly as he fought
in defence of his life and liberty, when a
loud cry from the forest close at hand
startled the Moors.
`Down with the Saracen! death to the
Moor! ho, to the rescue!'
Alfonzo, to his great surprise,
recognised
the stern voice of Gaspar. The
Moors, believing they were about to be
assailed by a superior force, gave back,
those on foot regaining their saddles in
great haste; and Alfonzo stood alone, as
it were, in the midst of his enemies.
When he saw Gaspar approach, he
rejoiced
to have such good aid, but was
surprised to see him coming towards him
alone; for he thought, as the Saracens
had done, that he had men with him.
`I am alone, my boy, but I will defend
or die with you. Two Christians to
sixteen
Moors is large odds, but let us have
stout hearts, and trust in the blessed
Saints, and we will get clear of them.'
The Moors, who had quickly placed
themselves in order of battle to receive
the expected attack, on seeing but one
person, now looked to Abdelasis for their
orders. This prince had mounted
Osmen's
horse, and taken a sword from one
of his followers. He instantly recognised
in the new comer his old foehe burned
to attack and punish him, and also to take
captive the young mountaineer, who had
thus far so successfully resisted the
efforts
made to take him prisoner.
CHAPTER. XXV.
THE REIGN OF THE EMIRS.
Gaspar
, upon coming up, ranged
himself
by the side of Alfonzo, and said,
`Now, let us walk backward slowly,
and face them, my boy. We shall soon
reach the covert of the wood, when they
will have to dismount to attack us. To
stand and fight with so many would be
folly rather than courage. Now for it.
Here comes my friend of the jewels at
full charge.
The Saracen leader spurred alone
towards
his foes, with his scymetar raised
to cut dow the wolf-slayer, as he should
ride over him. But Gaspar quicker, than
thought, caught the scymetar on the staff
of his wolf-spear, and turned it aside.
The horse and rider dashed past him,
and at the same moment came up Osmen
at the head of the whole troop. The
two brave mountaineers were forced
back to the edge of the wood, Alfonzo
keeping his assailants at bay with his
spear, while Gaspar, wielding the heavy
staff of his pike, like a club, swung it in
a circle around him, keeping a clear
space between him and the horses. The
shouts and cries of the Moors filled the
air, and the clangor of arms echoed and
re-echoed through the forest. The two
mountaineers fought in silence, and with
the calm resolution of men who feel that
their lives depend on their own courage,
and strength. At length they reached
the wood covert, where the horses could
not follow them, and bounding away deep
into the forest they left their pursuers
far behind them. The Emir Abdelasis
followed them on foot a short distance,
when Alfonzo, seeing it, turned back, at
which he retreated, though not without
cursing him, at the same time loudly
giving his people orders to surround the
covert and endeavor to cut off their retreat
to the mountain.
`Heaven has saved me from thy
treachery
,
false Moor,' cried Alfonzo. `Thou
hast shown us Christians how to trust a
Mussulman. From this hour look upon
Alfonzo the Destroyer as thy relentless
foe.'
`And take the same challenge, Moor,
from Gaspar, the wolf-slayer!' shouted
the stout herdsman, as the plume of the
Saracen's turban was disappearing
beyond
the foliage of the copse. The two
brave patriots then hastened away
rapidly
through the well-known paths of the
wood, and while they heard the Moorish
horsemen vainly riding hither and thither
in search of them, the angry voice of
their chief heard above the tramp of their
steeds, they left them far behind, and in
a little while regained the foot of the
cliff of the cataract. There they paused
and listened. The Moor could no longer
be seen or heard, and far and wide the
cork-wood forest lay buried in the repose
of the sunny afternoon.
`They have given it up, and thought it
best to go back to Cordova,' said Gaspar
as he stopped and leaned his chin upon
the end of his pike. `You have made a
good escape from the false rogues, boy.
It is well I was at hand. Yet I did not
help you much, for you seemed to be
able to do your own fighting, many as
they were. But I never saw a man
harder
pushed than you were.'
`Well, I will tell you the truth, since
good hath come of it: after you departed
I resolved to follow you, and when you
should quit the Moor, join him myself,
and give him a chance of defending his
jewels and his life; and so I kept you
in sight.' `By the mass, I thought you
would never leave him until you got to
the gates of Cordova.'
`The treacherous Saracen led me on
by pretending fear of any parties of
mountaineers. But his apparent timidity
I now see was treachery. He meant to
have betrayed me to Ali Hamet, if he
had not met the party of horse.'
`I saw you stop and talk, and then
discovered the Moorish horsemen coming,
even before you did; for I was higher
up on the road. I then crept forward to
see what would be the issue of the
meeting
to you, for I saw that you lingered. I
then trembled for you, Alfonzo, for I
know too well how little a Moor is to be
trusted. I was sure you would be
betrayed
;
so I came up to help you; and see
ing you set upon, I shouted as if I had a
party at my back, and dashed at them.'
`Your presence was timely, father. I
was hard pressed, and should have been
taken prisoner but for your outcry. They
fell back and gave me time to recover
myself. But for you, I should have now
been a captive to the Saracen, on my
way to Cordova.'
`If they had taken thee, I would have
rescued thee with an army of
mountaineers
.
I would have taken thee from the
very dungeons of the Algarf!'
`I owe my life to thee, father,'
answered
Alfonzo, grasping his hand and
affectionately laying it against his heart.
`Then my design to plunder the
Saracen
has proved a good one for thee. So
thou hast no words to say against it! He
deserved to be stripped and murdered
the false Moslem hound! My boy, we
men of Spain bear too much and too
patiently
the bonds of these unbelievers.'
`I know it, father,' answered the
youngman with stern sadness. `I know
it, father; and would to God there were
a David to arise in Spain to free our
nation
from the Philistines. But the nobles
have fled and wander in other lands, or
serve other princes. None remains but
the poor man, who cannot leave, or is too
insignificant, so think the conquerors, to
be troubled. Yet, father, there are seven
hundred thousand such men in Spain.
Would to God they had a prince to lead
them against the eighty thousand
Saracens
that enslave them!'
`Amen to that, boy. But the spirit of
our people is crushed. The children of
Spain, with their king slain, are like
sheep without a shepherd. Timid and
cringing, they strengthen the very chains
the hand of the Moslem has laid upon
them. Dost thou know that Christian
men and women, young men, young
maidens are bought and sold in the
shambles of Cordova like beasts?'
`I have heard it, father,' answered the
young man, with a crimsoned cheek and
a kindling eye.
`Yes; within the last two months they
have openly made a slave-market. And
men who have been in Cordova tell me
that there prowl about parties of slave
stealers who carry off the unprotected
female or youth, wherever they can do it
safely, and barter them in the city to the
keepers of the slave bazaars for gold. It
is enough to make a Spanish man blush
with shame that these things should be so
and we suffer it.'
`I know it, father. I have thought of
all these things and have wished that I
had the power in my single arm to
redeem
Spain. But we can only weep and
pray for our enslaved country! There
is no spirit in the people. There is no
prince to raise the standard of the cross
for them to rally around.'
`When Taric the conqueror beheaded
the king and queen, he did a wise thing,
for the stability of his own power, to
destroy
also the three princes. If one of
these had lived and Spain could behold
him, lethargic as you think the people
are, they would rise as one man and
follow
him wheresoever be would lead
them. The wrongs we have endured in
the twenty years of the Moorish sway
have made us desire their overthrow,
even at the price of our own blood.
Spain would fight now, boy, more
bravely
to recover her soil, and temples and
homes, than she fought to defend them.
Then she had not felt so bitterly the
weight of the Moslem rule as she has
since done. She did not have such
reason to hate the Moor as she has since
done. May God have pity upon us and
send us help from Rome or some other
Christian power. It is the cause of
Christendom to drive out the people of
Mahomadoun. We should make
pilgrimages
to their courts, and on our naked
knees implore them to send a Christian
Prince to succor us and lift the standard
of the Holy Cross up against the
accursed
crescent. I have never looked on
the new moon, which they take for their
device, since the battle of Xenil, without
feeling it is unlucky to undertake
anything
before its second quarter. The
moon was crescent and shone upon our
ranks when we fought the disastrous
battle
of the Xenil. The Moors fought by
its light and conquered. It was and is
the Christian's evil star. But we need
not stand here and talk of the wrongs of
our country, boy. The day is passed
that I hoped to see Spain redeemed.
But one day, as says father Godfrey,
the arm of the Lord will be made bare
and the mocker at the cross will come
down to the dust. But I shall not live to
see it.'
With these words, uttered in a
desponding
tone, Gaspar turned and began to
ascend
the steep path by the side of the
water-fall.
`What news have you from Cordova
within a day or or two, father?' asked
Alfonzo, as he walked by his side.
`Nothing. The council of Emirs still
rule like so many snarling dogs watching
a dead deer. I hope they will soon cut
one another's throats. But it matters
little to us whether Spain hath twenty or
only one ruler, so that the power is
Moslem.'
`The last rumor that came to me said
that the Emirs were daily expected to
fight among themselves for the Caliphate.
Each one of them had fortified his
Seraglio
,
and went about attended by an
armed force, and even met in conclave,
like enemies during a truce, holding a
council on the battle-field.'
`Yes; and this state of things cannot
long last. They are so well balanced
against each other in point of numbers,
that neither dare make the first move.
They say, those who go into the markets,
and from whom I learn these things,
these people say that the most powerful
of these is Algezir; not that he has more
followers or more gold to buy over
adherents
,
but on account of his indomitable
spirit. They all fear him and he despises
them all. But prudence keeps him quiet
until the suitable time shall arrive for him
to act. He will then make a move.
But he has an enemy and rival he fears
more than he does his fellow Emirs.'
`You mean Abdelasis, who has to-day
proved himself so treacherous,' said
Alfonzo
.
`I am glad I have seen this rich
young Emir, of whom I have heard so
much; I am glad, too, that he has shown
me his true character; I am resolved,
father
,
that the false Moorprince though
he beshall pay dearly for his
treacherous
designs upon me. But these are idle
threats! I am powerless: what should a
poor herdsman do with menacing
vengeance
against a powerful prince?'
`This Abdelasis is indeed powerful,
and he is a powerful rival of the
ambitious
Emirs;' said Gaspar, as he fastened
his spear in the crevice of the rock, and
drew himself upon the verge where
commenced
the level space on which the
hamlet was built.
`Yes, he is rich; and being the son of
a popular Emir, has many friends of his
father. It is true he has no authority.
and lives, as he told me, simply as a
citizen
in Cordova;but his court is like
that of a prince, and his retainers
outnumber
those of any three of the Emirs.
They all fear him; and Algezir, men
say, feels that he is the only rival who
can interpose to defeat his pretensions
to the throne. But Abdelasis has
remained
quiet, outwardly, though all men
know he will not continue so for a
moment
after the Emirs shall break the
peace of the city.'
`It is my belief he will yet be Caliph
of the kingdom,' said Gaspar, as they
approached
the hut.
`The Saints forfend! then Spain would
indeed bleed. Young and noble-looking
as he is,
we
know, father, that he has a
heart base enough to suggest, and a hand
ready enough to carry out any deed of
wickedness. God save poor Spain from
his rule!'
CHAPTER XXVI.
THE HERDSMAN'S BOARD.
The
two speakers had now reached
the front of their cabin, and Gaspar,
saying
that he had to look after his goats,
turned to leave Alfonzo at the door.
`You will go in and get some dinner,
father,' he said; `it is two hours past
noon.'
`That is true!' answered Gaspar,
entering
the cabin; `I had forgotten that I
was as hungry as a bear on a month's
fast. Here comes Xariffa with a pitcher
of goat's milk in her hand, and the table
is set for us, I see. Well, girl, the Moor
is on his way to Cordova, and, by the
mass! we are well rid of him. Ah! holy
father, art thou still honoring my humble
roof? Thou shalt eat with me this day,
for long abstinence is not good for thy
age; fasts are for young, lusty fellows,
to mortify the flesh, not for thee. Come,
here is a flagon of sour wine: it is the
best the Moors have left us, and we must
call it
Aldana
, and believe it so! Here
is goat's milk on the board, holy father,
if thou likest it better; and I see that the
active XariffaHeaven bless her!has
placed a loaf for each of us. Come,
father
,
say a grace, and let us fall to!'
`Thou art too hospitable for thy purse,
son,' answered the monk; `but I will eat
with thee gladly; I have need of strength,
for I have duties before me.'
With these words the hermit drew up
to the humble board; and while Alfonzo,
Xariffa, and old Gaspar, stood reverently
around it, he asked a blessing upon the
coarse fare. They then sat down, the
three men, while Xariffa walked about
the table waiting upon them, filling now
Gaspar's brown mug with sour wine, now
urging the hermit to take more of the
fresh goat's milk, or help himself to more
of the loaf, and now filling her brother's
cup with fair water.
They ate with appetites and
enjoyment
;
and when the first edge of their
fasting was taken off, Gaspar proceeded
to relate, in his blunt way, the
adventures
of himself and Alfonzo in the
forest
.
The Monk was amazed at the
treachery
of the Moor, and Xariffa could
hardly refrain from openly expressing
her indignation. But she discreetly kept
quiet, for fear that she might, by some
unadvised expression, betray the fact that
the false Saracen had seen and talked
with her. She knew that such
intelligence
would deeply, and with reason,
afflict her brother, and that she could
scarcely succeed in clearing herself from
all blame in the face of the fierce and
angry excitement which the knowledge
of it would produce. She, therefore,
listened in silence, her features
expressing
to her brother vividly enough her
sense of the infamous conduct of their
late guest.
`I don't know that I ought to be
surprised
,
my children,' said the monk.
`This is the Moor's character. It would
have been surprising, had you returned,
Alfonzo, and told me you had guided
the Saracen till he fell in with a party of
his followers in search of him, and that
he suffered you to depart in safety.'
`By the red mass! I shonld have been
surprised too!' responded Gaspar, as he
put down from his lips the half-emptied
mug, after a long draught.
`There is no red mass, my son,'
answered
the hermit, in a severe tone of
reproof
.
`I have often had occasion to re
mind thee that thy oaths are not well
chosen, and are too frequent.'
`Then, by the mass! I'll swear no
more, holy father, save when I come
across a Moor; then I will swear. They
are always swearing by their Allah and
their Prophet's beard, and I am not going
to be put down by such hounds, in this
matter. Besides, a good oath, sworn in
faith, hath a blessing in it!'
`Thou mayest swear, if need be, on
certain occasions; but see that thou use
no more thy favorite adjuration of the
red
mass. There is no mass but one.'
`I thank thee, father; but I have
heard Christian knights swear by the red
cross!'
`That is different, for the cross was
indeed
reddened by the blood of him who
was nailed thereon.'
`I see, father! My religious
education
was something neglected in my
youth; and I thank thee for thy
teaching
.
Would it be a sin for a Chrisrian
to swear by Allah?'
`It would be both a sin and a great
evil, my son! Thou shouldst make no
use of the words of the Infidel. I know
not if it is right to learn and speak their
barbaric and unholy tongue so much as
we do. Daughter, this bread is very
sweet and palatable! I never find such
bread in any other house in the Sierras.
Thou art an excellent housewife!'
`That she is, holy father. Thou canst
never throw away praise in giving it to
Xariffa. She is a rare maiden for one
who has been so many years without a
mother! Such a man as I am, father,
makes but a poor dame for a girl! But
I have done my best, and she is docile,
and things come to her hand easily.
Alfonzo
here has, however, done most for
her. She must thank him and not me!'
`Nay, father, I owe myself, all that I
am, to both of you!' said the pleased
Xariffa.
`And to the holy father! He hath
had the religious teaching. But for him
thou wouldst not have known the
difference
between a red mass and a white
one. Thou shouldst thank him also.'
`I do, dear father Godfrey,' responded
the maiden, smiling gratefully upon the
venerable face of her teacher. `I know
that I belong to each and all of you; and
I ought to be happy to be so loved and
protected.'
`Yes, thou wilt find protection,
daughter
,
not only from our arms, but those of
every youth and old man in the Sierras,
for many leagues west and east. They
all know thee and love thee. It is no light
affection that causes all people to call
thee the Star of the Sierras; yet thou art
spoken of more by this pretty title by all
the young men and maidens, than by thy
own christened name. It shows thou art
good as well as comely!'
`My father always goes on thus
praising
me when one begins,' said Xariffa,
laughing and blushing, as she looked
towards
the hermit.
`He has said none too much, daughter
If thou couldst hear Alfonzo discourse
of thee thou wouldst not heed thy father's
praise.'
`I know the boy loves her almost as
well as I do.'
`As well, father!' cried Alfonzo, `I
will have it that I love her quite as well.
Who is so dear to me as my sister?'
Xariffa thanked him by a sweet look
of affection, but at the same time gave
him a glance so peculiar that he knew
that she would have said, had she put the
glance into words, `I know I am dear to
thee, brother, but still I believe that
Genilla
is still more dearly beloved.'
The humble meal at length ended, and
the two herdsmen rose up, Gaspar to go
after his goats, which he had left under
the care of Pablo, up the cliff, and
Alfonzo
to return to the charge of his gazelles,
which the faithful Ban had been
guarding
,
as they fed far up the mountain.
`I am going up to my cell, and will
ascend
the pathway with thee, son,' said
the hermit.
`I am glad I can help thee up, father.
I hope you will accept my father's kind
invitation, and live with us. Thou art
getting too old to climb the mountain.'
`Thanks, sons, both of you. But I am
yet strong. I have, it is true, been
something
ill of late; but it was, I doubt not,
from too much fasting. I will take more
care of my health: as I find I can't
endure
the vigils and penance I once did.'
`It is impossible you should, father,'
answered Gaspar. `Now, fare thee well.
I go to my work; for I have a nice
garden
on the cliffs, which I dig in while my
goats feed. The soil is as rich as butter.
Thou shalt eat garlic and Spanish lentils
from it yet.'
Thus speaking, Gaspar started off alone
taking his way along a path that led
through the gorge. Alfonzo and the old
man went up the mountain track, the
latter refusing the aid of the young man.
At length they gained the uplands of
the Sierras, and Alfonzo found his
gazelles
feeding in security under the
guardianship
of Ban.
`I will go on with thee to thy cell,
father
.'
`No. I will not take thee from thy
flock. Besides I would sleep awhile when
I get there, and thou wouldst be alone.'
`You have been abroad much of late,
father.'
`Yes.'
`Did you not go into the valley, last
night?' asked Alfonzo, wishing very
much to know, if he could draw it from
him, the object of his visit to the Emir's
Tower.'
`How know you this?' asked the
hermit
quickly.
Alfonzo was about frankly to tell the
holy father, but he feared to let him
know that he himself was also at Ben
Osmin's; therefore he said, evasively.
`I saw thee go in the direction of the
valley. It is dangerous for you to venture
far from the mountain, father. The
Moors will not even respect thy white
hairs.'
`I must go and come as my duty calls
me, my son,' answered the hermit; and
he fixed his eyes keenly upon the quiet
face of the young man, to see if there was
any reason to suspect that he knew where
he had been.
`True, father. How clear the
atmosphere
is here, father. Yonder party of
horse is full three miles away over the
valley, yet how distinctly we can see
them from this height. I should not be
surprised if it were the troop
commanded
by the treacherous Abdelasis.
`I cannot see so far, my son; my eyes
are, therefore, not pained with the sight
of the Moslem banners.'
`There is the Moor who lives by
yonder
tower, at the foot of the Sierra,'
continued
Alfonzo; `is he a quiet person?'
`It is Ben Osmin; and I believe, for a
Moor, he is an honest man,' answered
the hermit. `Why this question, my
son?'
`It becomes us to know well who our
neighbors are, father, in these
troublesome
times. We must know who to
trust; this Ben Osmin may be a spy of
the Emirs.'
`No; I believe he lives quietly there
with his daughter;but thou shouldst not
think of him, for then thou wilt think of
her. Remember thy sin, my son! Turn
away thine eyes from temptation. But I
wrong thee! I do not fear that thou
wouldst ever give thought to an Infidel
maiden. Hast thou forgotten this one?'
`I hope I shall never be censured by
you again, father, on her account.'
`I am glad of it, my son; think of thy
herds, and thou wilt leave little room for
the magic of Moorish women's arts to
hurt thee.'
Thus speaking, the hermit bade him
farewell, and went slowly up the
remainder
of the path, and was soon afterwards
lost to the eye of Alfonzo.
In spite of the holy father's caution,
the young mountaineer let his eyes
wander
in the direction of the Emir's tower;
and sharply did he gaze down into the
court of the cottage, in hope that he should
espy the fair form of Genilla, with whom,
since he had been her lover, he had often
exchanged signals from the cliff,he
waving his shepherd's scarf, and she her
snowy veil. But he did not see her, and
it suddenly came to his recollection
what the recent stirring events had
caused
him to forgetthat Genilla had
doubtless
departed that morning with her
father
,
Ben Osmin, to visit Cordova.
END OF VOLUME FIRST.CHAPTER 1.
There is an interval of nearly two days
between the events related at the close of
the last chapter and those which will
form the subject of the present volume.
In this interval, however, brief as it
was, great changes were effected in the
government of the valley of Andalusia,
that deeply interested alike Moor and
Christian. Before proceeding with the
events that followed this change, we will
devote a chapter or two to an account
of it.
When Abdelasis, the false Saracen
Prince, who had so basely requited the
hospitality of Alfonzo by attempting to
deprive him of his liberty, found that
pursuit
after him through the labyrinths of
the forest was in vain, he recalled his
troop together and proceeded to return
to Cordova. He had not ridden far,
silently
brooding over his defeat in losing
the possession of the daring mountaineer,
before he called to his side his
confidential
officer, Hamet Osmen.
`Well, Osmen,' he said, trying to throw
off his chagrin by assuming a light air,
`we will let this Christian dog go. By
and by he will come into my hands!
Just at this time to have captured him
would have given me no inconsiderable
power; for the mountaineers are strongly
attached to him; and the possession of
their idol would give me a control over
them. At least none of them would
have consented to join the Emirs against
me, while I held him as hostage!'
`And none of them would join the
Emirs in any manner, noble Prince,'
answered
Hamet Osmen; `they love none
of our foes too well to favor eithor of
them.'
`That is true; but still it would have
been to my advantage holding so
formidable
a personage. But this was not my
only motive in resolving to arrest him, as
you shall by and bye learn from me;
but not now. When did you leave
Cordova
?'
`An hour before noon, my lord.
After
we missed you on the mountain side
we searched for you, and wound our
bugles, and left no efforts untried to find
you. At length we gave you up for lost;
but still I hoped you might have fallen in
with some mountaineer, and by means
of gold been guided into the valley.'
`It was not long after I saw you, and
sent you on one path while I took
another
,
to head the wolf, that I met him
and gave him battle; but I soon after
fainted and heard no bugle. This
Alfonzo
and a monk, it seems, bore me to
a hut, and there dressed my wounds and
gave me a sleeping draught. To this I
owe my recovery.'
`The wonder is, it was not a poison
they administered to you, my prince!'
cried Osmen, with horror at the idea.
`Allah be praised for your escape! You
did well to arrest this peasant, for no
doubt he would have poisoned you if he
could have done so. But you asked
when I left Cordova:your highness
shall hear. As I said, after searching
long in vain, and night coming on, I
resolved
to return to Cordovahoping that
possibly you might have got clear from
the mountain, and found your way alone
to the city. On our way through the
forest, a man suddenly appeared to Abul
the pack-mule rider, and told him to say
to me not to trouble myself about you
that you were safe in a herdsman's hut
in the mountains, and would be in
Cordova
well within three days.
Having said this, the peasant
disappeared
as suddenly as he had appeared,
and Abul galloped forward and gave me
the information. Resolved at once to
ascertain where you were, I turned back
and searched for the man, scouring the
forest; but at length I was compelled to
give up the hope of finding him, and
with reluctance pursued my way to the
city, trusting that the intelligence given
by the man would prove true.
`This man was none other than
Alfonzo
,
the herdsman!' said Abdelasis.
`He said to me that he had met a Moorish
troop in the forest, and given precisely
the information you have repeated. It
would seem that he did not care to have
you come in person to his hamlet, with
so large a party of followers to carry me
away. These mountain Spaniards are
very jealous of the invasion of their
homes by the footstep of the Moor.'
`After reaching Cordova, and not
finding
you at the Palace, nor hearing of you
in any other quarter of the city, I gave
up the hope, which so long had cheered
me, that I should yet find that you had
returned before me. And I had now
either to believe the story of the peasant
to Abul, the pack-rider, or to suspect the
worst.'
`I am grateful, Hamet Osmen, for
your faithful attachment to me.'
`My lord, my life is in your hands!'
answered the Moor, bending his neck till
his forehead rested upon the saddle-bow.
`Thou shalt not be forgotten! Go
on and tell me what affairs thou hast
left behind thee in Cordova!'
`Thou shalt hear, my lord, all in
good time; though by Allah, I have no
special news, save that the Emir's are
ready to draw the scymetar to cut off
each other's heads at any moment.
This morning I did not feel easy about
your absence, even with the assurance of
the unknown mountaineer that you were
safe; so I resolved to take a select party
and ride to the mountains and once more
search for you, especially in the huts of
the herdsmen. But Allah blessed me
with the sight of my lord, on his way to
meet me.'
`And now for Cordova. The news
thou hast for me! for something must
have transpired since I left. How goes
it with Algezir?'
`He is still in his Seraglio, which has
the air of a castle. There was a rumor
that he had desired the Council of Emirs
to meet him in his Seraglio on some
business
;
but each had refused to attend,
fearing treachery when once inside of
his walls.'
`They know Algezir is not to be
trusted. But they are cowards all and
weak men. If Allah gives me life for
two days more I will stand upon their
necks and give Algezir's red-bearded
head to the dogs. I know that am strong
and that he cannot withstand my power.
To-morrow I will lift the standard of the
Prophet in the court of my palace, and
from the midst of my steel-clad guard of
faithful Zenetas proclaim myself Caliph
of the kingdom.'
`The time is ripe, my lord. If you
do not strike soon Algezir will do so. It
is impossible Cordova can longer remain
torn so many factions.'
`Within two days Algezir or
Abedelasis
reigns Caliph of Spain!' cried the
young Emir. `Thank the Prophet, we
are now well out of that black forest.
How proudly rise the domes and
minarets
of the capital above the
Guadalquivir
;
and the crescents that surmount
them seem to smile welcome to the new
Caliph.'
`Long live the Caliph Abdelasis !'
shouted Hamet Osmen in his enthusiasm
and tossing his spear in the air, he
galloped
forward again shouting, while the
troop, catching up the words, made the
air ring again.
`That will do, my faithful friends
answered Abdelasis. `It is well we are
in so lonely a part of the valley, so that
that the cry could not reach our foes;
for, if it touched their ears, we should
hardly be admitted into the gates of the
the city. Let it pass now, Osmen; but
do not be so rash again. When you see
the standard of the Prophet unfolded and
tossed upon the winds by my hand, then
you may make the name of Abdelasis
your battle-cry. But now keep silent.
Let us enter the city in close order and
peacefully.
The party of horsemen now trotted
rapidly forward, passing gardens and
las and vineyards, and groves of date
and figs, and orchards of oranges, the
trees glittering with their golden fruit
and by and by reached the shady bank
of the beautiful Guadalquivir. Here the
road turned to the right and followed the
shore, which was a scene of gardens and
palaces. Gilded barks were floating upon
the tide, and music and laughter came
from the snow-white pavilions nestled
amid the green foliage on the banks.
All around them was a scene of beauty
and life and enjoyment. They met
turbaned
travellers on ambling horses,
followed
by laden mules; parties of
merchants
met them, or were passed,
reposing
under the trees; slaves were
bearing
water in jars upon their heads from
the river, to irrigate the terraced gardens
that adorned the shore; and now and
then a wealthy Moorish citizen of
Cordova
would prance by, followed by a
Sedan-chair
,
borne by Christian slaves, in
which, closely shut up from view by
silken curtains, rode his wives or
daughters
.
As they approached the gates,
there suddenly came to their ears loud
cries from the walls. Shouts were borne
to them from the streets, with the clang
of armor, and far and wide along the
battlements rose upon the air the uproar
of battle. The gates were all at once
filled with terrified citizens, pouring out
on foot, old and young, male and female.
The travellers and merchants who were
approaching the town turned and fled,
and repassed the cavalcade in wild
terror
,
crying,
`The Emirs are at war! Cordova is
in revolution! Algezir aims at the
throne! Fly all peaceable men!' and
so they rode on to widen as far as
possible
their distance from the city.
The commotion was not witnessed
unmoved
by Abdelasis. He had no sooner
caught the sound of battle raging within
than he raised himself in his stirrups and
calling upon his followers, he cried,
`Now is my time! Forward!'
Like a thunderbolt, the Moorish
horsemen
rolled forward along the dusty road,
which each moment became more densely
thronged with those who fled from the
confusion and warfare within the walls.
As they came near the portals, Abdelasis
met a young Moor, who dashed up to him
with looks of joy, and yet with alarm
visible on his face.
`Ho, Ibrahim! Whither so fast?
What uproar is this?' cried the Prince.
`Allah be praised!' cried the youth.
`Is it possible that I find my lord alive?'
`Yes, and ready to take advantage of
this hour. What is going on in
Cordova
?'
`You shall hear, my lord,' answered
the young man, who seemed hardly to
realize that the Prince was alive. `You
see that your absence was bruited about,
and at length this morning flew from lip
to lip, that you had been slain by a wolf
in the Sierras, while hunting. This report
no sooner reached the ears of Algezir,
the Emir, an hour ago, than he sent a
confidential messenger to ascertain its
foundation. The messenger, it seems,
returned and confirmed the truth of the
report. Thereupon, Algezir has
suddenly
raised the banner of the Caliphate
before the Great Mosque, and
proclaimed
himself Caliph. He is at this
moment
at the head of a thousand of his
followers, attacking the council of
Caliphs
,
which were assembled in the
council
chamber of the Seraglio, to
endeavor
to effect a combination to overthrow
the formidable Algezir. At this moment
he is assailing the gates of the Palace,
and at every corner the followers of the
Emir are doing battle with those of
Algezir
.'
`And where are my people? Has
any attack been made upon my Palace?'
`Not yet, my lord,' answered the
young Moor, as he galloped at the side
of the Prince, who was all the while
pressing
forward at the head of his troop.
`Algezir will first overthrow the Emirs,
and then invest the palace. But your
friends are resolved to defend themselves
to the last. They have only need to
know that their Prince lives, and to have
you place yourself at their head to sally
forth, and attack the force of Algezir
with success. I was riding to find Osmen
and bring him back to the city, to aid us
with his skill and courage, when Allah
gave me instead, my Prinee.
CHAPTER II.
THE RIVAL EMIRS.
The
young Emir had listened to the
rapid relation of events given by Ibrahim,
with the deepest interest, all the while
galloping onward to the gates. The
populace
,
who were non-combatants, were
crowding out of the portal, each
carrying
some valuable, and every face
expressive
of the deepest alarm.
Several of the men who were
escaping
from the scene of battle, recognised
Abdelasis at the head of his score of
horsemen and shouted his name to those
around, and in accents of gratification
and welcome.
`Allah be praised! Abdelasis lives,
and is entering the city! Now the power
of the cruel Algezir will fall. Long live
Abdelasis, the son of Musa, the Caliph!
The mantle of the Prophet descends
upon
him.'
`Long live Priuce Abdelasis!' shouted
his followers, uow catching up the cry,
and making it ring again, till it
resounded
into the streets of the city.
`All true Moslems, who are for order
and just rule, let them follow me this
day!' cried the Prince. `Come to my
palace and you shall find arms. Let us
onward.'
With these words the youthful Emir
dashed forward, and rode with speed
through the arched gate-way, the people
crowding close to the pillars on the right
and left, to suffer him to pass with his
troop. After entering the city, he
turned
short to the right, to avoid the crowd
in the main thoroughfare, and by a
narrow
and unfrequented street, rode at top
speed towards his palace. Suddenly on
turning an angle in the street, he came
upon a party of the followers of Algezir,
pursuing a larger force of the Emirs;
for the conclave of Emirs had united
their troops to oppose the common foe
Algezir. The pursued were fighting
but in confusion and panic; while the
Algezirs, about thirty in number, press
them closely, and with courage.
No sooner did Abdelasis see how affair
were going, than he couched his lance
and led his men against them, shouting
aloud in his own cry
`Il Allah! Allah, Il Allah!'
Their appearance was so sudden, and
the onset so resistless, that the Algezirs
were routed, and compelled in their turn
to flyfor the unexpected appearance of
Abdelasis, whom every man supposed to
be dead, terrified them as if they had
seen a spirit.
`Pursue them!' cried the Prince, `to
the troop of the Emirs, and remember
that you owe your safety te Abdelasis!
The captain of the Emir's grasped the
hand of the Prince, and said, `Long live
Prince Abdelasis!'
`Can I depend upon you and yours?'
asked the Prince, as he returned the
pressure of the officer, whom he well
knew.
`In all that you undertake, my lord
answered the Captain; and then taking
up the war cry of the youthful Emir, he
rallied his men, and led them gallantly up
the street, in pursuit of the flying foe.
Abdelasis did not wait to see the result
but turning into another street kept on
his rapid way towards his seraglio or
Palace. He rode through a narrow lane
bordered with orange-trees, and came
suddenly to a gate that led into a spacious
square, on the opposite of which,
embowered
in noble trees, stood his marble
palace. At the gate he found a strong
guard drawn up to receive him, for
Ibrahim
had ridden forward to announce the
safe return of the Prince. Abdelsis
rode at full speed into the beautiful court
of his palace, hailed by the joyful
acclamations
of his followers, who filled the
court and the palace to the number of
two thousand armed men. There were
amoug them sons of Princes, Viziers,
Colonels and Knights of the noblest
Moorish blood. They were
magnificently
arrayed, and seemed to vie with each
other, in the magnificence and costliness
of their armour, and the beauty of their
horses.
Upon beholding their chief, the young
knights and captains crowded around him
and hailed him with acclamations.
Abdelasis
galloped round the court, showing
himself to his people, and receiving their
congratulations; and then, reining up
near the palace steps, he called his chief
officers about him, and said
`My noble friends, Allah has restored
me in safety to you. Instead of finding
yourselves besieged here by Algezir
without
a chief, you find me here to lead you
forth against him, and prepared to seize
the sceptre of the Caliphate. At this
moment, the din of battle in the great
square of the Mosque reaches our ears,
mingled with the sounds of contest in
other portions of the city. Algezir, at
the head of the flower of his troops, is at
this moment attacking the Palace of the
Caliphs, where the Emirs have been
artfully
surprised by him while in Council,
and their troops fight at disadvantage
without their chiefs. It is my purpose to
attack Algezir in the rear, by entering
the square through the street Ben Hamel.
Osmen, go and bring me the green
standard
of the Prophet.'
While Osmen was gone into the palace,
Abdelasis, with skilful generalship,
formed
his followersone quarter of whom
were cavalryinto columns for attack,
and with his trumpeters placed in the
van, waited the return of Osmenwho
soon came forth from the palace, and
kneeling by the stirrup of his chief,
presented
him with the sacred banner, which
had been consecrated on the tomb of the
Prophet at Mecca.
A profound stillness reigned
throughout
the vast court of the palace, broken
only by the falling of water in the noble
fountain that adorned its centre, and by
the swelling sounds of the distant warfare,
borne to the ears of the impatient
warriors
upon the breeze.
Abdelasis, having received the
standard
,
kissed it with great reverence, and
then elevating the staff, unfolded its
silken
field broadly upon the air before all
eyes. He then waved it slowly to and
fro, while the armed hosts surrounding
him, with one voice, cried
`God is great, and Mahomet is his
Prophet!'
Again the prince waved the royal
standard
,
and every voice cried
`Long live Prince Abdelasis! Death
to his enemies!'
`Now, Ibrahim,' said the prince to the
handsome Moorish youth who had met
him outside the city gate, `take this
sacred
standard and bear it by my side.
Warriors and friends, now let us show
this Algezir that there is a Prince in
Cordova
more powerful than he. I draw my
scymetar before all your eyes, and I
swear by Allah, that I will not put it out
of my hand save to grasp the sceptre of
the Caliphate!'
These words were received with a
shout, and a deafening clang of steel
struck against steel. The next moment
Abdelasis was galloping forth from the
gate of his palace, with Ibrahim on his
left, bearing the green banner of the
Prophet, and Osmen upon his right; close
around him also rode his faithful
body-guard
of Zenetan horse. Troop after
troop of gorgeous cavalry came next,
each led by a knightly captain, clad in
glittering steel armour, inlaid with silver
or goldfell into column and thundered
after him, till four hundred horsemen
were in rapid motion into the heart of the
city, in the direction of the loud din of
contest. The foot soldiers followed at a
fast trot, each man armed with a lance
and curved sword, and some of the
companies
carrying likewise bows and a
quiver
of steel-pointed arrows at their backs.
This large army, numbering nearly two
thousand men, were soon all in motion
through two parallel streets towards the
great Mosque. A strong guard for the
defence of the palace was left behind,
and the gates were closed as soon as the
rear of the troops left the court.
Abdelasis rode on at full speed, so that
only his two friends and his body-guard
could keep up with him. Louder and
fiercer arose the uproar of battle from the
square, as they approached it. The
streets were thronged with citizens flying
in all directions, now from the scene of
battle, now from the terrific advance of
Abdelasis and his cavalry. Friend and
foe, young and old, were alike ridden
over by the prince and his followers, as
he dashed forward like a war-eagle on
the wing.
He had not slackened rein or spoken a
word since he issued from the gate of
his palace, until he came within about
two hundred yards of the entrance of the
vast square which had become the
sanguinary
theatre of the revolution in
progress
.
Here the Prince waved his hand
to halt, and leaping from his horse he
walked forward a few steps and ascended
a flight of steps which led to the corridor,
and thence to the flat roof of a house
that commanded the scene of conflict.
The inmates of the house had fled from
it, and he encountered no one but a
trembling slave, too decrepid to move.
He soon reached the roof, and before his
eyes laid the battle field which he was to
charge upon.
The square was a vast area in the
centre
of the city, and save on the side from
which the Prince overlooked it, entirely
surrounded by noble buildings, palaces,
mosques, and Christendom Cathedrals
now turned into Mosques. The sides of
this magnificent area were lines of
columns
,
corridors, terraces extending for
several hundred feet, in the most
sumptuous
style of Moorish and Gothic
architecture
.
Vast domes rose above stories of
marble
pillars, and minarets pierced the sky
on all sides like a forest of needles.
The Seraglio of the Caliphate or palace
royal of Cordova, was directly opposite
the eyes of the Prince. This was a
beautiful
structure of rose-colored marble,
ornamented
by ranges of pilastres and
columns of the purest alabaster; while
vaulted roofs and entablatures of carved
porphyry increased the splendor of its
effect. On the left of it was the Mosque
of Omar, the most majestic temple of the
Moors in Spain, and on the left rose the
imposing towers of the Cathedral, upon
the summits of which glittered the
crescent
.
Over all these glorious piles of
marble, and porphyry and alabaster, over
all this opulence of architecture shone
the cloudless afternoon sun, lending a
new splendor to the scene.
But the eye of the Prince lingered not
on these beauties. The roofs of the
temples
were thronged with armed hosts, the
towers and the domes bristled with spears,
and from the tall minarets lances glanced
downward like lightning, while flights of
arrows, from terraces and corridors,
darkened
the air.
The porticoes of the Mosques were
alive with warriors, and the piazzas of
the Palace were converted into fortresses;
and the Emirs could be seen defending
them with great valor against the
fiercely
attacking forces of Algezir. The whole
area, vast as it was, was filled with
battling
parties. Every avenue from the
square was a battle ground. On all sides
the fierce war raged.
The Prince's eye having taken in
at a glance the situation of the field,
now searched for the Emir Algezir
among his people, and at length beheld
him seated upon his horse near the statue
Taric, in the square, surrounded by his
chief officers, and giving orders. The
bosom of the Prince burned at the sight,
and he waited only to take one more
glance at the field, when he descended
from the roof, leaped into his saddle, gave
one or two directions to Osman, who
galloped at the rear, and then waving his
sword, he gave the command to his
columns
to advance into the square at full
charge. Side by side with the Prince
rode the youth Ibraham, bearing aloft
the sacred standard.
Already had the news that the forces
of Abdelasis were approaching to mingle
in the conflict, been received; and as
Abdelasis descended from the roof the
news reached the ears of Algezir, as he
sat in the midst of his aids.
`My lord!' cried the bearer of the
intelligence
;
`the troop of Abdelasis have
taken horse and are advancing upon us!'
`They will easily be beaten back,
without
their chief,' answered Agezir
haughtily
.
`They have nothing to fight for!
Go and meet them, and offer them peace,
on condition they acknowledge me as
Caliph, and lend me the aid of their
swords; otherwise, when I have hanged
these Emirs, I shall put them to the
sword! Say these words to Hamet
Osmen
,
who doubtless heads them!'
The messenger had hardly gone from
his presence to meet the coming forces
which, from the place where Algezir
stood, were not yet visible, when another
horseman spurred up, and cried,
`My lord, Abdelasis himself is alive,
and heads his own followers!'
`It is false!' cried the Emir changing
countenance. `Who told thee this?'
`I saw him with my own eyes, my
lord! He rides at the head of his troops,
who fill all the street, and above his head
floats the standard of the Prophet!'
CHAPTER III.
THE YOUTHFUL CALIPH.
When
Algezir heard this news, he
looked as if he felt that his power and
his victory were about to be taken from
him; for his troops were everywhere
getting the better of the Emirs' forces,
and three of the Emirs had been slain.
He remained for a moment as if
stunned
by the intelligence. At length he
said, as if he doubted the truth of it,
`Show me this Abdelasis, and I will
believe it. It may be some of his knights
who have assumed his armor and
energies
.'
`He wears no armor, my lord. His
face is open to all eyes. Behold!'
`Look! he comes! The Abdelases
charge upon us, my lord!' shouted his
officers, riding hither and thither to rally
their forces to meet him as he came
prancing into the square with trumpets
sounding, his banners flaunting, and
with the thunder of the trampling of his
cavalry. Algezir beheld and recognised
his foe, and then his amazement and
hesitation
gave place to courage. His voice
was heard high above the uproar of
battle
,
and placing himself at the head of
some of his best troops, he pressed
forward
to meet the charge of the Prince,
who was advancing upon him at the
head of his horse, with lances in rest and
shouting the battle-cry,
`Allah, il Allah! Down with the pale
Emir!'
The two parties met in full career,
and a score of riders at the head of each
column bit the dust, overthrown in the
fierce shock of the encounter. Abdelasis
and Algezir met scymetar to scymetar,
and while their followers were fiercely
fighting around them, they fought hand
to hand with desperate valor.
Algezir at length, being pressed hard
by the Prince, would have been slain but
for his friends, who separated the
combatants
.
The tide of battle rolled
onward
.
Everywhere was heard the
war-cry
of Abdelasis. Everywhere he was
seen with the sacred banner held above
his head by the brave Ibrahim. His
followers
kept their eye on this and fought
their way towards it. Unable to
withstand
the fierce energy of the Abdelases,
who came pouring into the square in
fresh squadrons, both foot and horse, the
forces of Algezir gave way. In vain
their leader called upon them to stand for
the day might yet be his. They were
panic-stricken.
The sudden appearance of Abdelasis
had filled their minds with fear and
consternation
;
for on the presumption of his
death, had they raised the standard of
Algezir. The troops, too, that had been
attacking the palace of the Emirs, had
been called by their Chief's trumpet to
aid in repelling Abdelasis; and seeing
this, the Emirs, who had been ready to
surrender the palace, took courage, and
sallying forth, charged them from the
portals. Thus placed between two foes,
Algezir's forces were broken and fled
from the scene where they were so lately
victors, pursued along the streets by the
now conquering partisans of the Emirs.
Algezir, as he was escaping by a narrow
street that led along the wall of the
mosque, was overtaken by Abdelasis,
and, after a brief passage of arms between
them, was overpowered and taken
captive
,
while his guard fled, leaving him to
his fate. That fate he well knew would
be death. He therefore folded his hands
upon his breast and calmly awaited it.
`Melec,' said the Prince, turning to an
Abyssinian near him, and who had not
left following him through all the fight,
`do thy duty.'
The tall Abyssinian drew from its
scabbard a heavy, glittering scymetar,
and taking a hair from the mane of his
horse, passed it across the blade
delicately
,
the hair splitting evenly as it was
drawn athwart the razor-like edge. He
smiled with satisfaction, and leaping from
his horse, advanced to the Emir, and
without ceremony took him by his beard
and pulled him down upon his knees.
He then stepped back. There was a
flashing circle moving in the air, and the
head of Algezir rolled at the feet of his
conqueror.
A crowd of his followers, at this
instant
,
pressed round, and separated the
Prince from the body. They would have
rescued their chief. The Abyssinian,
standing up, bade them take him, and
pointing to the body, he fell back, and,
leaping upon his horse near at hand,
followed
the Prince. Abdelasis and his
guard, now once more galloped forward,
not having been detained more than a
minute by this summary execution on the
battle-field.
The Prince pursued a troop of the
fugitives
a short distance towards the gate,
and then reining up, said to Osman and
Ibrahim,
`This is far enough for us to go; now
let us return to the square, and occupy
it, and let the Emir's forces cut to pieces
those of Algezir. I must see that I am
not conquered in my turn by them. Sound
the recall,' he shouted to his trumpeters;
and the clear notes of his bugles sounded
throughout the city.
The pursuers ceased their pursuit, and
hastened back to rally around their chief
in the square. There Abdelasis made a
stand, and, marshalling all his forces,
formed them again in close order of
battle
.
The most of the Emirs on seeing
the Algezirs give way, had gathered their
people about them, and followed in hot
pursuit; but there were three of them,
who, instead of moving, remained near
the Mosque, and with their bugles, were
collecting their friends about them.
Their movements Abdelasis had
antieipated
,
and now clearly saw through.
`Osman,' he said to his lieutenant,
`thou seest those Princes there. They
join not in the chase because they would
take advantage of the absence of the rest,
and so endeavor to win the Caliphate
each for himself. Now that the Algezirs
are defeated, we must make an end also
of the power of the Emirs. We will
charge upon these troops ere they are
fully forward to resist us, and cut them
in pieces. Thus will Cordova be mine.'
With these words the Prince caused
the charge to be sounded, and in a broad
phalanx, he rode across the square upon
the seven or eight hundred Moorish
soldiers
,
assembled in three divisions, each
under its own chief, and each jealous of
the other. But they were willing to
combine
to resist the successful Prince, and
endeavored to force him back by a flight
of lances and arrows. But heedless of
these weapons, the conquering Abdelasis
spurred on, and fairly rode down the lines
of the Emirs. In a few moments their
defeat
was complete. Two of the Emirs
were slain, bravely fighting, scymetar in
hand, and the third fled into the Mosque
for safety, from his enemies. On all sides
the defeated enemy fled, and were
pursued
down every street with great
slaughter
.
Abdelasis now resolved to complete
the work he had so propitiously begun.
He ordered divisions to pursue the Emirs
who were in pursuit of the flying Algezirs,
and attack them in the rear. These chiefs,
finding themselves thus pressed, and
unable
to withstand the charge against them,
were filled with consternation. Some of
them fled to the Mosques, others finding
the gates in possession of Abdelasis'
troops, threw themselves upon their own
swords and died, while two of them sur
rendered themselves prisoners, promising
allegiance to the Prince; for every few
minutes by his command, a herald had
proclaimed pardon and peace to all who
would lay down their arms, and
acknowledge
him as Caliph. Hundreds of the
followers of the Emirs and of Algezir,
finding that the star of Abdelasis was in
the ascendant, availed themselves of this
clemency, and, casting their arms at their
feet, cried,
`Long live Abdelasis. Long live the
son of the prophet.'
The sun was within an hour of his
setting
,
when Abdelasis first entered the
square at the head of his cavalry, and as
he sank redly beyond the vale of the
Guadalquiver, he was master of
Cordova
,
and Caliph of the Moorish Empire in
Spain. Ere darkness veiled the city,
the sounds of combat had ceased, and
there were but two parties within the
walls, the conquerors and the vanquished.
The Emirs, save the two who had sworn
allegiance to Abdelasis, and the one who
had made a sanctuary of the Mosque,
were all dead, and their followers had
purchased their heads, by transferring
their allegiance to the conqueror. Every
gate and strong-hold of the city was
occupied
by the troops of the Prince, and
not a hostile arm was to be found in all
the capital, raised against the power of
the victorious Caliph. The Prince took
possession of the Royal Palace of the
Caliphate, and by the light of the rising
moon raised the standard of the Prophet
above its battlements. The trumpets
sounded, and a herald proclaimed that,
`Abdelasis Mohamed, Prince and
Emir and descendant of the true Prophet
of God, was from that hour Caliph of
the Moorish Empire in Spain, and that
life and death, laws and liberty are in his
hand. Let all men bow the knee to
Abdelasis
,
Caliph and Emperor. God is
God and Mahomet is his Prophet!'
This proclamation was made not only
in front of the palace where Ibrahim
elevated the standard, but at all the gates
of the city and in the bazaars and public
places. Before midnight the streets
were silent. The wounded had been
removed
to an old Christian Church, which
Abdelasis converted into a hospital for
their accommodation, and the dead were
carried away to be buried. The
insubordinate
had been lodged in prison
and the rebellious executed. Guards
were posted in every square and placed
at each gate of the city; and patroles
paraded
the streets till morning.
At the rising of the sun the
muezzins
from their minarets called in their loud
sonorus tones,
`God is great! There is but one God
and Mahomet is his Prophet!'
But to this usual religious cry and call
to worship Allah, they added on this
morning`and Caliph Abdelasis is the
Prophet's vicegerent! Let all true
believers
fear and obey him!'
Thus had Cordova fallen into the
hands of the courageous Abdelasis. By
ingeniously uniting the sacred authority
of a descendant of Mahomet with his
power as a chieftain and conqueror he
effectually secured the obedience and
allegiance of the moslems when they
saw him seated on the throne of power.
By unfurling the banner of their faith
above his palace he proclaimed himself
not only their ruler but their delegated
Prophet. Thousands of the haughty
Moors who would still have resisted and
plotted against the mere Prince and
Caliph, yielded passive submission to the
representative of their prophet.
The revolution had been complete.
Moorish Spain was once more governed
by a Prince of the regal line who had
a right to carry at the head of his armies
the sacred standard. No longer torn by
the daily dissensions of a score of gover
nors, Cordova began already to feel the
blessings of having the reins of
government
held in one man's hands.
By ten o'clock, the morning after his
brilliant conquest, Abdelasis made his
appearance
in the Divan of the Palace,
followed
by his nobles and proclaimed that
he was ready to give audience, to redress
grievances and execute judgment. He
was arrayed in the gorgeous green and
gold robe of the Imperial Caliphs, and
his lofty brow was crowned with a
crescent
of diamonds that glowed like the
sun. His countenance expressed grace
and condescension. His officers stood
around him also gorgeously attired in
robes suited to their station. Hamet
Osmen
he had appointed his Vizier, and he
now sat at his right hand clothed in
purple
and green with a golden scymetar at
his girdle, and a lawn turban upon his
head, sparkling with emeralds. On the
Prince's left stood the youthful Ibrahim,
whom he had made the Reis Effendi, or
High Chancellor of his Empire.
Numerous were the cases which were
brought before the new Caliph, all of
which he decided to the satisfaction of
the parties and won for himself a name
for great wisdom as well as for great
bravery. Before night the fame of the
Prince, who studied to ingratiate himself
with all, looking upon every man now as
his subject, had gone abroad not only
through the city but into the wide valley.
He invited by proclamation all who had
fled to return, and they should be
protected
in their homes, and goods, and
pursuits
;
and all who had gone forth from
the city the day before now came into
it again and resumed their avocations.
Thus within twenty-four had Abdelasis
by his courage and skill conquered a
kingdom and established himself on its
throne, ruling with absolute power.
Once more the old Moors lifted up their
faces and prophecied great glory in the
Empire under the new Caliph; and,
indeed
,
so far as appearances went, he
seemed destined to confer additional
glory upon the Moorish conquest of
Spain.
CHAPTER IV.
THE TWO HERLSMEN.
The
news of the revolution in
Cordova
,
of the overthrow of the government
of the Emirs, of the death of the
powerful
Algezir, and of the accession of the
conqueror, Abdolasis, to the Caliphate,
thus consolidating the Moslem power in
Spain, reached the ears of Gaspar and
Alfonzo in their mountain home.
The intelligence spread also far and
wide in the valley and beyond the
Sierras
;
but the news was received with
indifference
both by the Chrlstians and by
the Moors. The former heard it with
apathy, because it mattered little tn them
who ruled in Cordova, so long as it was
the power of the crescent that was
wielded
there; and the latter were satisfied
because, if Abdelasis ruled in the place
the Emirs, it was the decree of Allah.
Thus they became submissive through
their fatalism.
`What is to be is to be! God is
great, and Mahomet is his Prophet. Let
Abdelasis live a thousand years. With
these emphatie words the Moslem of
the valley everywhere received the news
of the change of Government.
`There is great news, father,' said
Alfenzo
,
as he entered the cabin, after
having
folded his gazelles at the close of the
day in which Abdelasis sat upon the
divan
,
giving judgment as Caliph. There
is great news from Cordova. The Emirs
have been defeated, and Abdelasis, our
late guest, sits on the throne of the
Caliphate
!'
`I heard it, boy! I was down in the
valley, and there met a Spanish slave,
gathering dry sticks, with which ha was
lading an ass. He told me the news.'
`Who was this slave that prefers life
to liberty, or even to death?'
Sancho, who once dwelt by the sprtng
of the palms, and whose Moorish master
now holds his house, and even his
daughters
in his haremSancho has since had
his heart broken, or he would not live so
submissive as a slave!'
`There are ten thousand Spaniards,
father, with whole hearts and strong
arms, this day, submissive bondsmen to
the Moor. Would to God it was not so!
What said Sancho that he had heard; for
I only got a thread of the news from
Pioso
,
the goatherd's boy, who said he had
met, as he was driving his goats towards
the city this morning, some who told him
that Abdelasis was Caliph. Heard you
particulars?'
`I was told by Sancho that yesterday
afternoon the Emirs fought among
themselves
,
and Algezir, taking advantage of
their confusion, attacked them, when
Abdelasis
,
who was supposed dead,
suddenly
made his appearance with a large
force on the ground, defeated Algezir
and slew him, and then utterly dispersed
the forces of the Emirs, slaying all but
one or two who fled to the mosques, and
then he proclaimed himself Caliph,
unfurling
their sacred standard from the
portico
of the royal seraglio.'
`This is more news than I got,'
answered
Alfonzo, with animated interest.
`So our false Moor has indeed
triumphed
.
How different now would have been
the state of things in Cordova, had we
detained him here or have let him
perished
upon the mountains. Heard you
anything further?'
`That the new Caliph has filled the
strong places of the city with his troops,
taken possession of all the gates and
placed them under a strong guard, and
proclaimed pardon to all who will swear
allegiance to him; and he has also
called
back all who fled, promising them
protection and security to their lives and
property.'
`He means to establish his throne by
clemency, that he may rule by and by
with tyranny. He begins mildly, to end
cruelly. I know the man, father.'
`His gracious manner of proceeding
promises no good, I am sure. His smile
is worse than his frown. Now that he is
Caliph, boy, how is this new government
to affect us? But this is a silly question.
What matters to you and I who rules in
Cordova? We are herdsmen under the
Emirs, and we shall be herdsmen under
Abdelasis. We were poor yesterday,
and we shall be poor to-morrow also.
Spaniards no longer have any interest in
the government of their native land. We
are slaves, and all the change we have
is change of masters.'
`Yet we may feel the power of the
new Caliph, father. The cup of
bitterness
and woe against poor Spain may not
all be emptied! I fear the worst from
the accession of this treacherous Prince.
He is popular with his own people, and
he is now formidable to his enemies. He
will govern in such a manner that he will
become their benefactor and our curse!
He may be to them a mild ruler and an
bonorable man, while only to us
Christians
he shows the dark side of his
character
!'
`He cannot press us down lower than
we already lie. I fear him not. But as
you say, he may be wicked enough to do
us more mischief than his predecessors
have left to be done. Now I can
conceive
that he may command any
Christian
to pay a tax of half he possesses into
his coffers; and forbid their coming into
Cordova, except they submit to
circumcision
,
which they keep up with their
father
Abraham, though they are
degenerate
sons of Ishmael, and deny the
Scriptures
,
as father Godfrey says!'
`Have you seen the holy father
to-day
?'
`No.'
`I was at his cell twice and he is not
there. I fear he may have gone to
Cordova
!'
`What should take him there?'
This question Alfonzo could not
answer
;
yet he believed that he had gone
there in order to see Ben Osmin, who
had already been gone since the morning
before; and he was led to this belief
from the fact that the hermit had been
seen going down into the valley the
evening
before, but had not been known to
return; and that he had gone to Cordova
was, he thought, more than likely, as he
had sent Ben Osmin there before him.
That Ben Osmin had really gone,
Alfonzo
ascertained that very morning, by
paying a stolen visit to the Emir's tower.
He found the gates closed and fast, and
all quiet about. The only guard was
Lopo, the dog, who seemed indisposed in
his jealousy of all comers, to recognise
even the lover of his fair mistress.
Satisfied that they had departed at the
time Genilla had said she should go, that
is early the morning before, he slowly
left the place and hastened to the
mountain
to his herd. But he carried with
him a sad heart, and a mind filled with
apprehensions for the safety of Genilla in
the city. He was prompted more than
once to hasten to Cordova to ascertain her
safety and urge her to return without
longer delay in so dangerous a place,
where power and might were right. But
he could not desert his charge, nor could
he with safety go into Cordova; for
besides
being known to Abdelasis, he was
known to many Moors who had been
with El Zegris and who were now in
Cordova.
But when, ie the course of the
afternoon
,
he got the news from the boy Pioso
of the revolution in the city, his anxiety
for the safety of Genilla in such a scene
rendered him inattentive to further
particulars
of the intelligence brought by the
lad. He hastened with his flock down
from the mountain, and folding it,
resolved
that he would commit its charge to
Pablo, until he should learn how it went
with Genilla in the warlike city.
He now was half resolved to go at
once under some safe disguise to see
what had become of Ben Osmin and his
fair daughter, amid all the tumult of
battle
in which she had been environed.
The idea that the hermit had gone into
the city confirmed him in his half-formed
determination to visit Cordova; for he
feared that danger would menace the
holy man as well as threaten Genilla.
Love will seek excuses innumerable to
defend any course it decides upon. So
Alfonzo, nearly persuaded himself that
his presence in Cordova was necessary
for the safety of father Godfrey, although
he was by no means certain that he had
in reality gone there. That he was not in
the mountain, he was well assured. He,
therefore, when he recalled to mind his
mysterious visit to Ben Osmin, and the
subsequent departure of the latter,
conceived
that the same events which led
the Moor to go to Cordova might have
rendered it necessary also for father
Godfrey
to meet him there.
It was these reflections, assisting his
wishes, that led him to ask Gaspar the
question he did. The interrogation with
which it was answered, he could not
reply
to, or rather, he did not care to. If
he had answered it, he would have to
unfold
more circumstances touching his
knowledge of Father Godfrey's late
movements
than he wished to betray to
Gaspar
.
`He could not go to the city, boy,'
added Gaspar, without tossing his grey
head. No, no, he is not in Cordova. Is
it so rare a thing for the holy father to
be absent, that you think he is gone to
Cordova, if he be gone a day.'
`But just at this time, father, it is
dangerous
for him to be in the valley. The
Moors, elated with their new government,
may be insolent and commit excesses.
I am half of a mind to go to Cordova and
see how things look there. I would like
to have been there yesterday, during the
fighting. It must have been a stirring
scene. I shall, be able, father, to get
into
the city and out again, if I disguise
myself as a Moor, which I will do. We
have plenty of turbans, kaftans, and
other of their Infidel apparel, taken from
those whom we have conquered from
time to time.'
`I see no need of you going to the city,
boy, unless you are tired of life. And I
should disown you, to see your face
under
a Moslem's turban. Stay at home,
and let the Moors and their city alone.'
`I would see this Abdelasis on his
throne; you know I have a quarrel with
him.'
`And I also,' answered the wolf-slayer,
in a low fierce tone.
`I would find occasion to punish him,
Caliph though he be, and surrounded by
his guards though he were.'
`It would be needless. If thou goest,
I go also. We both have quarrels with
him. But it will not do for the mole to
war with the eagle. We must be
content
to let things be. Come, boy, let
Cordova and her Saracens alone. It
grows late, and we should eat our
suppers
and go to bed. Where is Xariffa?'
`Here, father,' answered the beautiful
girl, entering at the moment, holding in
her hand the beautiful net which she had
heen at work upon when Abdelasis was
in her apartment.
`What is that, sister?' asked Alfonzo,
looking upon her lovely face and figure,
with the admiring eyes of fraternal
affection
and brotherly pride.
Vol. 2. Sig. 2.
`The net for my hair I have been the
last three days at work upon. Is it not
becoming?' and she threw it over her
head, and letting the front fall upon her
brow, she bound her tresses in it by a
knot, and stood before them, looking, as
if conscious of the beautiful appearance
it gave to her head.
`It is very becoming, child,' said
Gaspar
,
smiling. `You are always
handsome
,
and need no such ornaments; but
still it is very pretty.
`You have great taste, Xariffa. Such
a head-dress would become a princess.
How gracefully it falls to the shoulders,
like a scarf for them. If it were less
open it would serve for a veil.'
`Look. It is a veil already,' ssid
Xariffa
,
smiling. And casting it about her
face, and drawing the meshes together,
it concealed her face like silken lattice.
`Father, I see your eyes are cast-towards
the table, and doubtless, you think I had
better have been baking bread for thy
supper and Alfonzo's, than idling my
time in such work. But I have not
forgotten
thee; come and see.'
With these words, she took her father's
hand in hers, and beckoning to her
brother
to follow, she led them towards her
own room; and throwing open the door,
she pointed silently to a neatly arranged
table, placed in the midst of the floor,
covered with a white cloth, and set out
with two or three plates and cups, dearly
cherished mementos of former glory,
and loaded with such a display and
variety
,
that Gaspar exclaimed,
`By the red mass, what does this
mean, girl? Bread, curds, goat's milk,
leeks, dates, and wine. This is a feast
for our Emir.'
`This is a surprise,' exclaimed
Alfonzo
.
`You have shown us your best
housewifery, Xariffa.'
`What does it all mean?' asked
Gaspar
,
looking both surprised, and pleased
at what he saw.
`This is thy birth-day, father. If thou
hast forgotten it, I have not,' answered
the maiden, with bewitching grace.
`By the rood, I had forgotten it. My
blessing on thee, child. Never had a
father such a treasure as I have in thee.
Kiss me, dear! Kiss her, boy! There.
Now let us thank God, and eat.'
CHAPTER V.
THE BRIDE.
The
sumptuous supper, which the
filial attention of Xariffa had provided for
her father, in honor of his birth-day, had
just been eaten by him and Alfonso,
when there was heard in the outer room
a loud voice, calling out`Ho!
Alfonso
.
Ho, Gaspar!'
The two men sprung to their feet, and
hastened to the main apartment of their
hut, where they beheld two mountaineers,
a young and an old man. They were
looking very much excited, and upon the
forehead of the young man was a heavy
wound.
`How is this? What has happened,
neighbors?' cried Gaspar and Alfonso,
in the same breath.
`The Moors, Gaspar! The accursed
Moors, Alfonso!' answered the old man,
trembling with fear and rage, while he
shook his clenched hand.
`Yes,' criod the younger, more
calmly
,
yet evidently labouring under intense
emotion; `it is a new outrage of our
tyrants
,
Alfonso. Thou shalt hear all.'
`Sit down, Tito, sit down,' said
Gaspar
,
offering him at the same time, a
small bench.
`No, no. This is no time to sit!
Tell him, Louis! Tell him what hath
happened. But, then, what good for
them to know it. We can do nothing,
we are slaves!'
`Yes, they shall hear. The brave
Alfonso
shall know all, and he may aid me
in revenge, if not in rescue! Thou
knowest, Alfonso, that I was to have been
married this night to the fair Agata, the
daughter of the old miller, who lives at
the mill?'
`I heard so, Louis.'
`And this afternoon when the sun was
about two hours high, I started with my
father and brother, and two friends, to
go by the cliff path, and so down the
valley
road to the mill. But when we came
near it we saw it in flames, and
hastening
forward, the cries of combat reached
us, above which rose the shrieks of a
female. I recognised the voice of
Agata
and rushed forward. As we got to
the gate of the wall that encloses the
court, we saw at least a dozen of Moors,
engaged in plundering the house, while
two of them were bearing off Agata
between
them on their horses. Upon
seeing
our approach, they galloped forward
to pass us, but I seized one of the horses
by the rein, and struck with my staff the
rider to the ground; but the other
succeeded
,
with Agata in his arms, in
escaping
into the plain, followed by the rest of
the Moors.'
`I would have stayed the man who
fled with the maiden,' said old Tito, but
he rode over me too quickly for me to
grapple with him. But two of the Moors
we tipped out of their saddles; but their
horses escaped, or we would have
mounted
them and pursued!'
`It would not have availed, Alfonso,'
answered Louis, with accents of deep
grief. `They flew like the wind across
the plain. She is lost to me for ever!
I shall never forget her looks and cries
of anguish as she passed me, shrieking
`Save me!' Oh, save me, Louis!' I did
all man could do, but Heaven ordered
that I should lose her! I was turning
to pursue her on foot, when old Simeon
came tottering up to me, bleeding with
many wounds, which he had received
in defence of his house and child. I
stopped to support him. He had life
only to tell me that he had done all in his
power to protect Ageta; that the party
of Moors had come to him demanding
money, which not having to give, they
had attacked and fired his house, and
carried away his child!'
`To sell her into slavery in the
public
Bazaar!' cried Tito, with indignant
warmth. Gaspar, thou hast heard this
outrage now. But thou answerest
nothing
.
Does it not touch thee?'
Suppose
it had been thine own'
`Hush! Utter not such a thought to
me! I was silent, because I could not
find words to express my feelings. My
heart was swelling too high for utterance.
Boy,' he added, turning to Alfonso, who
had listened with the most intense
interest
to the account of the young
bridegroom
,
and now walked up and down the
paved floor, with quick and firey steps.
His eye blazed, and his hand grasped
vehemently his wolf-spear. There was
a stern determined resolution in his tread
that spoke more eloquently than words.
`How long since was this?' he
suddenly
stopped and demanded of Luis.
`Not two hours; I have come hither
as soon as I could, giving the news as I
came to each hut. Oh! Alfonzo, that
you could once more rouse the Sierras to
arms, and avenge for me this wrong!
But what can be done? Nothing, I
know; we are but a few hundreds, and
the land is filled with Moors.'
`No, nonothing can be done;'
answered
old Tito, shaking his gray head.
`We must bear it;but it does us good
to tell one another of our wrongsthis is
all we expect!'
`When will Heaven have pity on our
poor land?' cried Xariffa, with strong
earnestness, having heard all. `Alas for
the helpless fate of Agata! So good, so
gentle, so fond of thee, Luis!'
`Do not speak of her, Xariffa!my
heart will burst!' sobbed the young man,
covering his face with both hands.
`By the red mass!' cried Gaspar, `I
feel in my arm the energy of a thousand
men to avenge a wrong like this. As
you were about to say, it
might
have
been me instead of Simeon the miller.
Did he die?'
`We left him stark and stiff,' answered
Tito.
`Yes, he died after telling us what had
befallen him and his; and I at once came
along the mountain road this way, while
my brother and my two friends went
northward to give the alarm, and rouse
the indignation of the people, and put
them on the watch lest their own homes
be invaded; for Simeon said that the
Moorish captain told him that they were
but one party of several, sent from
Cordova
to-day by the new Caliph
Abdelasis
,
to levy subsidies of gold and silver
for the support of the new government;
and also with orders to make captive the
most beautiful of the mountain maidens.'
`So, if Simeon had given them gold,'
said Gaspar, `they would still have taken
his child.'
`I thought,' cried Alfonzo, in tones
that rung again, `I thought that the cup
of our woes and degradation was full;
but I see that there are yet outrages we
can suffer! My friends, we must expect
from Abdelasis such things as these, if
we will bear them:and what can we
do?'
`Nothing but bear them!' answered
Tito despondingly.
`We cannot help ourselves!' said
Gaspar
.
`We are weak and they are
powerful
we
must submit.'
`I would that I had five hundred good
Christian arms with mine,' cried
Alfonzo
,
`I would not bear these thingsI
would lead them on to the very gates of
CordovaI would rescue Agata for thee,
Luis, or have Abdelasis's head!'
`Where wilt thou find even a hundred
men, boy, who would follow thee to
Cordova
?
We may get together a band to
drive robbers from our Sierras, as we
would band together against wolves to
destroy them; but go to-night with Luis
by thy side through the whole breadth
and length of the mountainslet him
proclaim at the door of every hut the
wrong he has suffered, and let you call
with the voice of a trumpet upon their
inmates to arm and follow thee to the
gates of Cordova, to bring back or avenge
the maidenwhat would they answer?
Would they move? would they not call
thee a madman? The men of Spain fear
the Moor as well as hate him, boy! They
dare not go forth in their strength to give
him battle again, and drive him from
heir soil.We are all become slaves and
serfs!'
`I fear it is true what you say, father.
I should fail in getting men to follow me
to rescue this maiden. They fear the
Moor; they are slavesthey, and you,
and Iand we fear our masters! Oh!
if my life, laid upon the altar of my
country, would save it, gladly would I
sacrifice it! But these wishes are vain,
neighbors. Luis,' he added, grasping
the hand of the unhappy youth`You
have lost Agata, and my heart bleeds for
you! I feel for you as if you were my
brother: for this is a wrong that comes
home to us all. To-morrow every young
man may stand in your placeevery
maiden in the place of the lost Agata.
If by giving my life I could aid you,
cheerfully would I give it; but I know
not what to domy father hath spoken
too truly.'
`I fear he has. Yet I know not what
hopes led me to come to thee,
Alfonzo
!
All eyes turn to you in danger!
All hearts throb with pride when thou art
named. Yet I know you cannot help me.'
`And heavy is my sorrow and shame
that I cannot. The Moor is stronger
now than heretofore. Abdelasis is
powerful
!
He will consolidate his empire
by the union of the numerous parties that
have hitherto weakened and torn it. We
can do nothing! We can only pray to
Heaven to have mercy upon us and not
inflict upon us more than we can bear!'
Thus speaking, Alfonzo walked slowly
and sadly across the room. Luis stood
silently gazing after him, and seemed to
be wholly overcome with his great loss
the heaviest and most grievous man can
suffer.
Old Tito did nothing but utter terrible
denunciations against the Moors, and
vehemently
call upon the saints to
interpose
to their overthrow. Gaspar sat upon
a bench, sullen and silent, his face
between
his hands, which rested upon his
kness. By the door stood Xariffa, gazing
in upon them with a pale countenance
and looks of anxious solicitude. For
some minutes all was still; each one
engaged
in his own painful thoughts.
Suddenly
the silence was broken by a heavy
tread without, as if men and horses were
approaching. Alfonzo sprung to the
window, and, by the glowing twilight, for
the sun had just gone down, he beheld
three men coming very fast towards the
hut. By their garb he knew them to be
mountaineers, though two of them
carried
scymetars and a third was mounted
upon a richly caprizoned Arabian steed.
They were evidently bearers of some
news, from their excited manner.
`Who comes without?' cried Gaspar,
slowly rising from his bench.
`One of them is Guiseppo, and
mounted
upon a Moorish horse; the others are
friends, though armed with scymetars!'
answered Alfonzo as he threw open the
door.
`Thank the saints, thou art at home,
brave Alfonzo, and thou Gaspar; and
here is Luis and his father too!' were the
words of the one upon the horse. `I am
glad I have found thee!'
`What is the matter? Hast thou met
the Moors?' cried Alfonzo.
`Yes, and slain each our man!'
`God and the saints be blessed!'
shouted
Tito.
`Hast thou seen Agata? Say that she
is rescued!' cried Luis, as he laid his
hand upon the arm of the speaker.
`I know nothing of any rescue or of a
maiden, neighbors,' answered the man,
as he leaped from the horse. `Thou
shalt know all. But briefly learn that this
horse was half an hour ago straddled by
a Moor, and that the two scymetars my
two honest friends here bear were
grasped
by Infidel hands!'
`How came this about?' demanded
Gaspar, as he walked round the horse
and looked at his rich harnessing, and
then took one and the other of the
scymetars
into his hand to look at.
`Hast thou heard the law yet?' asked
Guiseppo, who was a short, crooked little
man, with a very brilliant eye and a
resolute
air.
`What law?' asked Alfonzo. `Dost
thou speak of a law of the new Caliph's?'
`Yes. Thou knowest Abdelasis is king
of the Moors?'
`We know it. Proceed! What law
is this?'
`It will astonish you. But I don't
know that we ought to be astonished at
any thing. This very day noon he
issued
a decree that every Christian within
the realm of his rule should, within thirty
days, report himself at the palace of
Cordova
,
and there be registered, his name
and his worldly goods, and his children
and their ages; and this on pain of death
for disobeying the edict!'
`Do I live to hear this thing?' cried
Gaspar, with intense feeling.
`Peace, father,' said Alfonzo, with
forced calmness: `words are not for
such acts as these we are listening to!
Peace, father, he has more yet to say!'
CHAPTER VI.
THE DEATH OF THE MOORS.
All
bent eagerly forward to hear what
heavier outrage than this already related,
could be conceived against the conquered
Christians by their conquerors.
`Yes,' answered Guesippo, `I have
more to say. The edict which I have
spoken of, not only calls on us to
register
our names before the Reis Effendi,
but it declares every Christian who shall
refuse to become a follower of the
Prophet
,
and worship in the Mosque of
Omar
on the day he registers his name, a
slave, and as such to be brought and
sold, as other slaves, in the bazaar!'
`Do my ears hear thee aright,
Guesippo
?'
asked Alfonso, in a low
impressive
tone; and he laid his hand upon his
shoulder for the answer.
`What I have just now said I will
repeat
.'
`No, no. These are enough. Now,
tell me how thou hast heard this?'
`Yes, Guesippo,' cried Gaspar and
Luis in one breath! `Tell us how it
came to thee?'
`From the Moor's lips who sat in this
saddle.'
`Ah! Didst thou know him?'
`Listen and know all I know, Alfonso.
I was going with these two herdsmen, to
sell a dozen goats to the Mufti, who lives
in the Mosque, in the plain, once the
Church of the village of San Maria. I
would not sell to the Infidel, but we must
live, neighbours. We must have gold
and the Moors alone have it. I have often
sold to the Mufti before, and made him pay
well; though I would have been glad
that the first mouthful of goat's flesh had
choked him, and every Infidel that ate of
it. I will secure this firey horse to the
stake by the corner of thy hut, Gaspar!'
`A thousand wishes wont kill one
Moor,' answered Tito, as Guesippo
returned
and leaned with his back against
a block at the door, while the others
gathered around him with dark looks
and earnest attention; the tall form of
Alfonso over-topping them all. Directly
opposite, and keenly facing Guesippo,
stood Gaspar, leaning on his broken
boar-spear
,
his wolf's knife by his side.
Old Tito, supported by a staff taller than
himself, stood within the door in the
shade; and next to Gaspar, with her
hand upon his arm and indistinctly seen,
bent the fair form of Xariffa, eagerly
listening.
`I had sold my goats,' continued
Guesippo
,
`and left the Mufti with my silver
in my pouch, and accompanied by my
two men here, who had helped me to
drive the goats. I had not gone more
than half a mile, when I heard galloping
and shouting behind me, and looking
back what should I see but three Moors
on horseback coming after us at top
speed. The road was narrow, and there
was a thick brush hedge on either side,
so that we could not get out of their way;
for I had no desire to be too familiar with
them, especially as I had a pouch of
silver
at my girdle. So I resolved to run
for it; but finding they were coming up,
I spoke to my men and said, we are three
Christians to three unbelievers! Let us
give them battle in the name of the
Virgin
.
Each of you seize a horse by the
bit, while you defend your heads with
your staves, from the blows of their
scymetars
,
and it may be, we will unhorse
them! My men promised to do as I
did, and turning full upon them, we
rushed
to meet them with loud cries, each of
us seized a horse by the bit, and guarded
our heads with our staves from the blows
of their scymetars. Two of the Moors
were unhorsed by the sudden shock given
them by their horses being stopped so
suddenly. The other broke away and
fled, seeing us despatch these two before
they could rise. One of the horses got
off also, but I held mine firmly by the
bit, and in an instant was in his saddle
in pursuit of the fugitive. But he rode
better than I, and turning back I bade my
men take the scymetars of the dead
Moors and come after me. So we held
on our way at a good speed fearing
pursuit
;
for the village was not half a mile
behind us. But, thank the saints, we have
reached here in safety, and show you
our horses and arms as proofs of our
words!'
`You have done well, Guesippo, you
and your friends. By the mass!' cried
Gaspar, `I would I had the killing of
these Moors!'
`And you saved your gold?' enquired
old Tito.
`Yes, and have this fine horse and
these scymetars besides; one of them,
you see, has a hilt of solid gold.'
`We should have great spoil of these
Infidels, if we would have courage to fight
them,' said Gaspar.
`And these Moors were not then those
who bore away Agata,' said Luis, with a
tone of deep disappointment. `I had
hoped, at least, that if she were not
rescued
she had been avenged.'
Here Alfonzo briefly informed
Guesippo
of the outrage against Luis, and the
death of Simeon the miller.
`I saw such a party of Moors at a
distance
,
passing east of the Mosque,'
answered
Guesippo. `They were a good
three quarters of a mile off, and were
riding
towards Cordova.'
`It must have been the same,' cried
Luis. `Oh, my poor, lost Agatawhat
must be thy anguish, as well as mine!'
`Slaves! slaves! slaves!' slowly and
impressively repeated Alfonzo, as he
walked up and down the room. `We
are then become slaves! Oh, Christian
men! can Spain submit to this? There
are thousands in the land who have yet
thought themselves free, so long as the
Moor kept his hand from their tables;
but they will now feel the weight of the
Moslem yoke! Would to God they
could feel it cut into their necks so
deeply
that, unable to bear it longer, they
would throw it off as one man, and cry,
`Liberty! and for God and Spain!'
At these stirring words, those about him
started, and Gaspar waving his staff,
repeated
the cry
`Liberty! God and Spain!'
`Wordsmere words, my friends!'
said Alfonzo, dropping his head sadly.
`We have voices, and can speakthat is
all! They have not cut out our tongues
yet; but so long as we can do no more
than talk, let us be silent. Men should
use their steel, not their tongues!'
`Alfonzo, if thou wilt tell me how to
use mine to purpose,' cried Luis, `I swear
to thee it shall be drawn and made good
use of! I will not give rest to my body
till I have avenged or rescued Agata.'
`Thou talkest madly, boy!' cried
Gaspar
;
`thou mightest as well say you will
pluck Abdelasis by the beard before his
divan.'
The young man blushed, feeling too
keenly the rebuke; for he felt that he
was impotentthat he could in truth
accomplish
nothing.
`I cannot tell thee, Luis, what to do
save to bear or die,' answered Alfonzo,
in answer to his call upon him for aid.
`Spain will never move to throw off her
yoke, or avenge her wrongs, without a
prince to lead her to the field.'
`We must have a leader, Alfonzo
but it need not be a prince,' answered
Luis. `If thou shouldst raise thy
standard
upon a peak of the Sierra, every
man within sight of it would hasten to
rally around thee.'
`I believe it, boy,' answered Gaspar.
`There is no doubt of it,' cried
Guesippo
.
`Do not all men know thee to be
braveto love thy countryto mourn
for her wrongs? Trust me, neighbors,
that all in the mountains would sooner
follow Alfonzo here than a prince whom
they know not. We have tried thee,
Alfonzo
.'
`Mock me no more!' answered
Alfonzo
,
with a bitter smile. `Mock me no
more, my friends, and you my father.
I have slain wolves and driven robbers
am I therefore a leader of a people?
You make me scorn myself, to think I
should be so idly talked of, and
entreated
.
My standard! What is it?a wolf's
hide? No, no! Make me not angry,
my friends.' Thus speaking, the young
man left them, and walked into the
cabin
.
`Yet I will maintain my words, though
he be angry,' said Luis to the rest. `If
it were known that all men might have
an opportunity of redressing their wrongs
by flocking to the standard of Alfonzo,
even were it no more than a wolf's skin
hung upon his spear, he would find
himself
at the head of an army ere thirty
days.'
`I know it. The Spaniard is no longer
asleep,' said Gaspar, `we are all awake
to our wrongs. Our hatred of the Moor
is ready to drive away our fears.'
`I pray you, Gaspar,' said Guesippo.
`I pray you talk with thy son.'
`And press the matter upon him. He
is the only man in Spain can save Spain,'
said Luis. `Fair Xariffa, speak to thy
brother, and rouse him to give the
subject
attention.'
`My brother needs no rousing, friend,'
said the maiden; `he feels too keenly
now the wrongs his country bears. I have
heard him groan, by night when others
slept, over the oppression of his country.
But he feels that he can do nothing, and
what
can
he do? He is, even as
yourselves
,
poor and without power. He
would die for Spain, but his death would
not redeem Spain. We must look to
heaven, not to man, for aid.'
`The maiden spcaks truly,' answered
Tito. `I see nothing that we can do.'
`And shall we tamely become slaves
to the Moor?'
`I would like to know what man will
first give his name to be put on the
register
,'
said Gaspar with closed teeth, and
speaking through them. `If I were by I
would put my knife into his body.'
`Yet, thou wilt have to do it thyself,
Gaspar, brave as thou art,' answered
Guesippo. Thou must do it or lose thy
life.'
`I will not register my name there.
May I cut off my right hand ere it is so
false to me.'
`What wilt thou do?' asked Luis.
`Wait till they come after me.'
`And then?'
`Write my name on their hearts with
my broad knife,' responded the
wolf-slayer
,
as he pressed the point of his knife
upon the palm of his own hand. Then
those who would, after me, write their
names, may dip their pens in my blood,
if they will. I go not to Cordova to
worship
in their Mosquesnot I.'
`Who talks of going to Cordova?'
asked
Alfonzo, coming forth with a stern
brow, and firey air. `Who will bend his
neck to the heel of the Moor? Speak;
for I would see him?'
`That is the temper I am glad to see
thee in, my boy,' cried Gaspar with
delight
.
`Thou didst mistake. Said I, for
one, I go not to Cordova.'
`And who also says he will not go
among you?' asked Alfonzo, in the hoarse
deep tones of a man who is deeply
excited
,
but is endeavoring to repress all
outward emotion.
`I say not that I will not go to
Cordova
,
but I say that I will never bow my
knee in the Mosque of Omar,' firmly
responded
Luis. `I must see Cordova; for
I must avenge Agata. I go there, not to
use a pen, but a dagger.'
`Bravely worded, boy,' cried Tito.
`That spear hath the metal in it;' said
Gaspar. `With one thousand men of
such spirits, I would not fear to call on
Abdelasis in his seraglio. What
thinkest
thou, boy? You seem gloomy.'
`Gloomy? No, no; I am right
merry
.
Have we not enough to make us
glad? We, poor, valueless peasants, are
to become of worth. We are to be priced
by the head. Rejoice, Gaspar! Thou
wilt be worth, perhaps, six hundred
moidores
of silver, and thou Luis, as many,
perhaps. I may sell for five hundred;
and thou, Guesippo, for five hundred and
fifty, while Tito may be priced at three
hundred, going less, in consideration of
his age. Merry! Have we not reason
to be merry; to think that we poor rogues
of Christians are really worth so much
counted gold. Who dares to be gloomy?'
No one answered him. His words
sunk deep into their hearts. With but
few words more they separated, each to
his home and bed, there to forget awhile
their own and their country's wrongs.
CHAPTER VII.
THE GAZELLE-KEEPER ON THE HILLS.
Early
on the ensuing morning, ere
the day fairly broke, Alfonzo opened the
door of the hut and walked forth. He had
passed a sleepless night. The wrongs
of his country, his sympathy for Luis, the
edicts of Abdelasis, all pressed upon his
thoughts and kept him waking. The most
of the night he passed in pacing his room
and devising a thousand schemes of
exalted
patriotism; but each of which he
rejected as visionary. Conscious of his
own weakness and that of Spain,
compared
with the power of Abdelasis, he
he felt that all he could do was to weep
and pray for his country. He feltso
reasoned hethat it was for God's honor
that the crescent should be overthrown
and the cross replaced, and he trusted
that God would open a way to have it
done. He trembled too for the safety of
Xariffa. Ignorant that Abdelasis had
seen and spoken with her, he
nevertheless
feared for her lest she might be
taken
away during his absence, as Agata
had been borne off. He could not,
however
,
place her where she could be safer.
His hut was his only castle, and no place
he could command was safer than that.
To be there always was impossible; yet
he hoped that the retired bamlet would
escape the marauding parties of the
Moors. At any rate, he resotved that
either he or Gaspar would always remain
at home; and he determined to arm all
in the hamlet, and keep up a watch upon
the path down to the valley. The ab
sence of Genilla also, to Cordova, with
her father, now for two days, deeply
occupied
his mind. His thoughts were
tortured
with the imaginations of a thousand
evils which might have befallen her. At
one moment he felt it his duty to go and
seek her and ascertain her fate, and at the
next he felt that a duty equally sacred
called upon him to remain for the
protection
of Xariffa. He could not divide
himself. He was, therefore, in a state of
the most painful anxiety and suspense.
Gladly, therefore, did he hail the first
note of the cock which proclaimed the
night departed and day at hand.
It was still dark when he came out of
doors. The stars were glittering like
diamonds, and scarce a change in the
deep blue of the sky, told which was the
eastern horizon.
The air was still, and silence and
peace reigned everywhere about him,
save in his bosom. He walked on a few
paces, and he then thought he saw some
object move in the darkness before him.
He looked intently, and listening, he was
sure he heard a small stone move, as if
it had struck against another, as a
footstep
would disturb it. He thought of his
fold of gazelles on the north side of his
hut, and of the prowling wolf, and
whistled
low for his dog, while he stepped
back into the door for his wolf-spear. He
came out instantly, followed by Gaspar,
whom he had called up. Both were
armed
and advancing cautiously towards the
deep shadows under the woody rock,
where he had heard the movemenls; he
could discover nothing. They walked
around the fold, and all was quiet. Ban
the wolf-dog came towards them and
rubbed his nose against them, and
seemed
to suspect something.
`It must have been your fancy, boy,'
said Gaspar.
`I am sure I saw some object moving,
but so indistinctly, I could not tell
whether
man or beast. The next moment I
heard the noise under that date-rock.'
`It may have been the dog himself.'
`It is likely, since we discover
nothing
.
If it had been a wolf, he would
have left his scent on the air, and Ban
would have snuffed it! Do you go to
the hills this morning, father?'
`Why do you ask that? Have I not
four score goats to feed on the
mountains
?
Must I not watch them and show
them where to browse, and pick up their
scanty forage? I am not rich enough to
stay in the valley a day while the Moor
is in the land. I might ask you if
you were going to keep your sixty
gazelles
and kids in their folds to-day!
Come, let us rake our breakfasts in our
scrips and off!'
With these words, Gaspar, who this
morning was in a worse humor than
usual, removed the oaken bar from the
gate of his fold, and going in sullenly,
drove out his herd and turned them up
the mountain. He then entered his
cabin
,
where Xariffa was already stirring,
took his bag or scrip containing his
breakfast, and fastened it to his rough
and hairy girdle.
`Now the good angels keep thee on
the hills to-day, father!' said the maiden,
as she kissed, as her custom was, his
cheek before he went out. `Thy face
is heavy! I hope thou art not ill!'
`I am sick for poor Spain, daughter,'
was his answer. `Keep close within
today
.
Thou knowest enemies are abroad.
I shall not wander out of sight of the
cabin
,
so that if the Moor be seen in the
valley, coming this way, I may be here
to do battle for thee!'
`Father, the Holy Virgin will protect
all who trust in her!'
`I hope so, child, I hope so! Let me
kiss thee again! There! Now take care
of thyself. I feel sad to-day, very sad
and heavy. But it will pass off when I
get upon the hills where the fresh air
blows!'
At this moment entered Alfonzo, who
had also turned his gazelles from the
fold and sent them with Ban up the
hill-side
.
`Boy,' said Gaspar, `we have a kid
here to guard against worse wolves than
menances our folds. If thou canst keep
in sight of the hamlet through the day,
and also have a sharp eye upon the roads
in the valley. If thou seest any parties
prowling about our glen, hasten home,
sounding thy goat-horn with the fierce
war notes that used to ring in the ears of
El Zegris!'
`I will do so, father. I feel that we
have in Xariffa a most sacred charge.
At any hour the Moor may be in our
hamlet!'
`Fear not, brother,' said the matden,
smiling, though in truth she felt
sorrowful
at heart; for since she knew that the
youthful Moor who had declared his
passion
fer her was the same Abdelasis, now
become Caliph, she trembled at a power
which, prompted by his mad love, might
make her its victim. `Fear not, brother.
The fearless are ever secure!'
`Heaven grant that no danger come
nigh thee, my sister. I go now upon the
hills, but as no Moor can come near the
hamlet without being seen in the valley,
I shall be here as soon as a foe can be.
But I trust our little humble home will
escape the eye of the destroyer!'
Xariffa now prepared her brother's
breakfast as she had her father's, and in
a few minutes afterwards he was slowly
winding his way up the side of the
mountain
after his gazelles. The dawn was
just silvering the east as he reached the
rock by the old date tree where he had
first heheld Abdelasis, when haughtily
advancing he commanded him and the
hermit to give way and let him pass.
The valley of the Guadalquiver still lay
in darkness and the repose of night. A
he ascended, the light increased, and
when about six hundred feet up the
mountain, he paused, and by a signal
dispersed his gazelles to forage. He
then watched the opening day.
Gradually
the sky brightened, changing its
pale, silvery hue to a mellow rose, and
the rose deepened into a purple, which
rapidly catching the glories of the
advancing
sun, became a rich deep hue of
gold.
The valley threw off its veil of
darkness
,
and the forest stood boldly forth
from the plains, and then the vineyards
became distinct, then the villas upon
them and the gardens; and soon the
Guadalquiver
,
catching the golden radiance of
the moon, shone like a burnished spear;
and suddenly the crescents of the
Mosques
in Cordova flashed back the first
beams of the sun which had already
some minutes before kindled the peaks
of the Sierras.
The position from which Alfonzo
beheld
the day advancing hid from his
sight the hamlet; as he intended to go
higher up the mountain still, where it
would once more be in view beneath him,
as well also the Emir's tower. He,
therefore, now began slowly to drive his
flock before him to the higher region of
the mountain. He had proceeded but a
short distance, when he beheld Gaspar,
who was standing upon a bold rock on
the opposite side of a vast cleft in the
hill, and waving his bernish towards him
and at the same time pointing down the
mountain in the direction of the valley.
Alfonzo could also hear him shout, but
could not understand what he said, for
he was a third of a mile distant. But
suspecting from his manner, and seeing
him begin rapidly to descend the rocks
with great leaps, that some enemy was
in sight, he hastened forward to a bold
promontory which commanded a full view
of the hamlet and the family. As he
ran he heard the sound of a horn blown
in the direction of the gorge. Loud
voices came to his ears from the hamlet.
He thought he heard a female shriek.
He bounded onwardhe flew! he
out-stripped
the wind. He reached the
promontory and glanced down the sleep
mountain side. The roofs of the eight
or nine cabins composing the hamlet
were directly beneath his feet. Could
his eyes be believed. But his ears
confirmed
their vision. There was a party
of not less then three score Moorish
horsementhe fierce Zenetan cavalry
by their red sashes and long lances, in
possession of the hamlet. The door of
the hut was thronged with them. Two
or three mountaineers were seen flying
up the glen with terror, and Pablo was
visible ascending the mountain, blowing
the horn he had heard.
A glance showed all this to the startled
eyes of Alfonzo. He comprehended all
his sister's danger. It was with an
effort
he resisted the impulse to fling
himself
from the lofty height on which he
stood among his enemies. He saw one
bring his sister forth shrieking, and leap
into his saddle with her in his arms. He
staid but a second to wind a war blast
upon his horn, and then, with rage and
grief burning his breast, he flew to her
rescue, not calculating the numbers
against him. The strange conduct of
Gaspar was now explained to him. He
saw that he had first discovered the Moors
in the hamlet.
As he descended, Gaspar met him at
the intersection of the paths. Neither
spoke a word, but, grasping hands,
bounded
down the steep path towards the
hamlet. As they descended they could
see the Moors galloping out of the
hamlet
,
and beheld them going at a slow pace
carefully down the rocky way by the
cascade. They could see Xariffa
clasped
in the arms of the foremost, borne
farther and farther from their eyes
Who can picture their grief and
bitterness
of soul? At length they reached
the hamlet. They stopped not to go
into
their now deserted cabin. They knew
that she, so loved, was no longer there.
Pablo and two of the herdsmen of the
hamlet joined them. The five pursued
with the speed of hounds. But horse
were fleeter even than the feet of love or
the wings of vcngeance. When they
got into the plain and could see before
them a mile through the forest, the party
of horse were just visible disappearing
in a slight depression of the road, and
evidently moving at a very rapid rate.
`Stay, Alfonzo! We may as well
stay and leave her to her fate. We can
do nothing. God has cursed us! Let
us lie down and die!' and Gaspar, the
strong stout Gaspar, with his iron frame
and courageous heart, sank upon the
green sward beneath a forest tree, and
buried his head between his knees.
Alfonzo could not gainsay his father's
words. He well knew that pursuit would
be in vain. That to attempt, even if he
came up with the party, to rescue her,
would be attended with the sacrifice of
his own and his father's life without
benefit
to her. He stopped, therefore,
following
the waving plumes of the Zenetan
horse until they were out of sight, and
then striking his forehead in the anguish
of his soul, he cried, as he gazed upon
his prostrate father,
`You are right, we can do nothing,
you and I and these three; but the time
has come when these shall become three
thousand! From this hour I swear, and
hear me Heaven! I swear that I will
live only for vengeance and the freedom
of Spain! This hour I dedicate myself
to my country! If there be no Prince to
lead, let men follow a peasant, so he lead
them to liberty and revenge!'
CHAPTER VIII.
THE CONSPIRACY.
At
these stirring words of Alfonzo,
uttered as they were in the stern
moment
,
and under the fierce influence of
the bitterest grief, Gaspar raised his face
from between his knees and smiled. The
smile was not scornful nor mocking, but
it was like a beam of sunshine from his
soul. He rose to his feet, and looking
Alfonzo steadfastly in the eyes, he said,
`Young man, thy speech would have
brought me to life, had I been dead. Did
thy words come from thy heart?'
`From the depths of my being, my
father
.
I can no longer remain passive.
Well did Guiseppo say I needed to be
roused. I
am
now roused fully. It only
wanted this last drop to make my cup too
bitter to be drank. `Xariffa!' he cried,
stretching out his hands in the direction
the Moors had borne her, `be patient!
Thou shalt be avenged! Henceforth I
know only thee and my country. Father,
I am but oneand these our friends are
but three more; but we will increase
apace. There is Luis and Tito, and
Luis's brother, and there are our
neighbors
on the east and west and north of
us. They will join us when they hear
that Alfonzo would avenge his sister, for
they all loved her.'
`Oh, this is worth living for, boy!'
cried Gaspar. Now thou art thyself. I
see that it wanted but this. You no
longer doubt your power and
influence
!'
`I doubt nothing. I am all hope. I
will accomplish everything that I am
going
to undertake. Xariffa may not be
saved from the harem of the despoiler,
but she shall be avenged. Now, father,
let us talk calmly of what shall be done.
For the present let us forget my sister.
Let us bend our minds to the great
purposes
that are pressing upon them. Thou
art ready to be with me in what I will do,
father?'
`There is my hand, boy; and I make
upon it and thine the sign of the cross.'
`It is enough! Now hear me! There
are yet to be found in the mountains the
hundred men who have fought with me
against El Zegris. Go to each of them
and say that Alfonzo needs them again,
and that he raises his standard
`The wolf-skin!'
`Nonot now. That will do to go
against robbers with. But now we are
to fight the infidel and war against the
crescent. Say to them that Alfonzo has
raised the standard of the Holy Cross on
the rock of St. Paul, and they that love
Spain must hasten to it without delay, and
each bring his companion with him.'
`Oh, this tells again. I could almost
forgive the Moor for robbing me of my
child, to know that another blow is to be
struck for Spaiu.'
`I would I had not been so selfish. I
would that the tale of other's wrongs had
come home to me as this has done. I
did, indeed, have need to be touched
close to my heart to feel as I ought. But
there shall be no lack of action now. I
will avenge both Luis and myself, if my
countrymen will stand by me. Oh! who
have we here? A horseman, and lo! a
score of footmen running after him!'
`It is Guiseppo. There is Luis also
and a score of friends,' cried Gaspar.
`They come armed. Hear their shouts.
They have heard of our loss, and come
bravely to the rescue.'
`Thank God! This does not look like
cowardice!' said Alfonzo. `I do in my
heart believe that the hour has come not
only for me to act, but all Spain to feel
that it must rouse from its bondage. How
bravely they come on. What ho, friends!
Welcome!'
`Is this news true?' cried Guiseppo,
who, mounted on the Moor's horse he
had captured the day before, came first
up, brandishing a scymetar in his hand.
`Too true, Guesippo.'
`And where are they?'
`Beyond pursuit: we abandoned it
here in despair.'
`I could go no further, neighbors,' said
Gaspar; `when I saw my child disappear
beyond succor, I sank beneath this great
tree, and should have died here, but for
words that came from Alfonzo that put
life into me, and, as you see, have made
me strong again.'
`What were they?' cried Luis; `let
us hear them.'
`That from this hour he would
consecrate
himself to the liberty of Spain and
the overthrow of the Saracen! He
spoke from his heart, and I stood up and
embraced him, thanking God that the
only man who can redeem Spain had
resolved
to redeem her. Yes, Alfonzo,
surprised you look: but I assure you that
every patriot in the land has had his eyes
on you with hopes they hardly dared
breathe.'
`I thank them all; I will fulfil those
hopes, my friends, or perish! The
audacity
of the Saracen has got to its height;
our forbearance has given him power
and insolence: we are slaves because we
had not courage to be freemen. Luis,
Gaspar, my father, you my friends all,
go and tell each his neighbor the tale of
wrong done this day. Luis, I need not
urge you to be diligent in rousing the
peopleyour wrongs shall be avenged
as well as my own and our country's.
Now, Luis, bear to each man thou
meetest
the word that Alfonzo has raised the
standard of the cross, and calls on all
Christians to rally around it. Here come
more of our friends.'
`By the mass! we shall number fifty
soon!' cried Gaspar: `see how they rush
onward!'
`Would that the Moorish party were
now near!' said Alfonzo; `we would
rescue Xariffa, and punish her captors!
But we have now only to look to
vengeance
.
Welcome, neighbors! you are
too late to pursue the Moor, but not too
late to draw the sword in defence of
Spain!'
As he was speaking, a party of at least
twenty-eight men, herdsmen and
mountaineers
,
armed with spears and pikes
and large knives, came up one after the
other. They had heard the sound of the
war-trumpet, and hearing from the
women
they met in the hamlet what had
occurred
,
they boldly pressed forward to
join Gaspar and Alfonzo in pursuit.
`Dost thou know, Juan,' said Gaspar,
to one who seemed to be the leader of
the party,`dost thou know that Alfozo
has promised to lead against the Moor, as
he did against El Zegris, all who will
follow
him?'
`Then he will find himself at the head
of ten thousand men, for this number of
our countrymen will follow him,'
answer-the
man with animation. `But this is too
good news!'
`It is nevertheless true, my friend,'
answered Guesippo; `we are to have a
leader, and the Moor shall yet tremble on
his divan! We must strike now for
Spain, or never. We have but thirty
days in which to become slaves, or free
Spain of the Moors!'
`The nobles will not follow him,' said
a young man of the party that was just
come up. `They despise the peasants
of the mountains.'
`We need not the nobles' aid,'
answered
Gaspar; `we peasants will free Spain.
Every true man, noble or serf, will rally
around him who dares set up the
standard
of the cross within sight of the
crescent. Our nobles are exiles, and
poor and depressed, and their pride is
gone. If they will not come to the
rescue
,
let them remain in their bondage.
We at least will be free. Thirty days,
neighbors, is a short time to drive the
Moor out of Spainbut, God willing, we
will do it.'
`We must go to work secretly at first
not to alarm the Moor and awaken his
vigilance,' said Alfonzo, looking around
him into the dark forest in which they
were thus accidentally assembled.
`There are no foes looking onyet let
us be cautious with our voices.
`The Moor must be ignorant to the
last moment. The time to do something
for Spain is ceme. I feel my own
weakness
and inexperience, but as you call
on me to lead in this great movement,
I will do so, till some one abler shall
take the conduct of it. It is needful that
some one should stand up for Spain,
though it be one so humble as I am.
What I am I give to you, and to my
country
.'
`Lo! The hermit.'
`Father Godfrido!'
`See! There comes the holy Abbot,'
cried several voices, pointing along the
forest path where he had just appeared;
and Gaspar hastened to meet the old man
who was advancing towards the group
at a rapid pace, and with looks of
surprise
.
He was hailed by them with
animation
,
mingled with reverence.
Alfonzo
ran, and meeting him, embraced
him with affection.
`God has returned thee in safety, holy
father! I began to fear evil had
befallen
thee!'
`I am well. But what means this
assemblage
?'
demanded the hermit, as he
gazed round upon the stern faces, and
armed hands, of the congregated
mountaineers
,
as they stood grouped beneath
the majestic tree, which grew over the
road.
`Hast thou met no Moorish horse?'
asked Gaspar, earnestly.
`I beheld a large party of cavalry a
mile or more distant, but turned aside
into the adjoining wood, and so let them
pass.'
`That party of horse, father,' said
Alfonzo, taking his hand and pressing it
with deep emotion, while his brow wore
a cloud of dark vengeance, `That party
bore away in its midst, my sister Xariffa,
as a captive! I was on the mountain,
when they came to the hut: but,
doubtless
,
they approached in the nighthad
been lying in wait in covert till I should
depart; for well they knew they would
not all return, who came on such an
errand. After I reached the mountain,
they rushed upon our peaceful home
and I only heard the cry of alarm in
time to see them galloping from the
hamlet
,
with Xariffa in their power. I
sounded
the war-cry, and gathered together
such friends as I could, and pursued, but
in vain. Here we stopped, and here have
we been binding ourselves together, no
more to return to our pursuits, till Spain
is free of the Moorish yoke! Doubtless,
thou hast heard of the thirty days time
given us, within which, to become
Moslems
,
or die!'
`Yes, my son, I have heard it,'
answered
the hermit; for I have been in
Cordova!'
`And come back in safety.'
`I wore the dress of a Mufti, and so
escaped the vigilance of the Infidel!
There I beheld Abdelasis, and heard
with my own ears proclaimed the
bondage
of my people! I came back to the
mountains, my son, to call upon thee to
do what I see thou hast resolved to do
make an effort to free Spain from the
Infidel! I see by thy bearing in the
midst of those who stand around thee,
looking up to thy face with hope and
confidence
,
that thou art chosen tbeir
leader
!'
`Alfonso is our chief! We will
follow
him wherever he will lead!' cried
Guiseppo. `We will avenge the wrongs
of Spain or perish.'
Gaspar now briefly stated what had
been done by them, and when he ended,
the hermit said with a face beaming with
joy
`The hour at length has come for
which I have for twenty years fasted and
prayed. Heaven has heard the prayer
of our bleeding land. For this moment,
my son, Alfonso, have I been training
my mind and heart. I knew that this
hour would come. I knew when it came
all men's eyes would be fixed on thee!
Thou hast higher ends in view, my son,
than mere vengeance against those who
have robbed thee of thy beloved sister,
for whom I will mourn by and by! I
will forget her now, though thou mayest
remember her to nerve thy arm if need
be. But I know that thou art afflicted in
all the afflictions of thy country. I know
that thou lookest to her emancipation in
thus consecrating thyself to her. Thou
standest up among thy people, not the
avenger of a sister merely, but with a
nobler aim, as the redeemer of thy
country
!
As such I hail thee! Kneel, my
son, and receive my blessing, and be
consecrated
to thy great mission!'
The young chief reverently kneeled
before the majestic person of the hermit,
who laid his hand upon his head, and
raising his eyes heavenward, he said in
the most solemn manner, while all
uncovered
their heads, Gaspar and Luis and
Guiseppo kneeling a little behind Alfonzo.
`I now consecrate and set thee apart,
Alfonzo, as the redeemer of thy country;
her leader in battle; her defender and
saviour, in the name of the most Holy
Trinity. May the blessing of the God of
armies be upon thee and the spirit of the
Lord Jehovah guide thee!'
Thus speaking, the holy hermit took
from the olds of his garment a small
silver cruse of peculiar construction, and
from it poured a few drops of fragrant
oil upon his head, adding,
`Thus I anoint thee the Deliverer of
Spain, in the name of the Father Son and
Holy Ghost, Amen!'
`Amen!' profoundly responded
Gaspar
;
and from every lip echoed the like
deep and solemn response.
CHAPTER IX.
THE DEPARTURES.
Alfonzo
, thus solemnly anointed
leader
of the Christians, in this incipient
movement to overturn the Moorish
power
,
rose to his feet, looking both
surprised
and serious. The consecration
had made a deep impression upon his
mind, as well as upon the minds of those
who had witnessed it. He was diffident
of his influence over others, but still
feeling
that some one should rise in behalf of
Spain, humble as he was, he was willing
to give himself, his life, all that he was,
to her.
The hermit now took from its sheath
the dagger of the young chieftain, and
going to a helm tree near at hand, he
struck from it two branches, one shorter
than the other, and stripping them of their
bark, he bound them together in the
middle
with a withe of the bark, thus
constructing
a rude cross.
This he placed in the hands of
Alfonzo
,
and said,
`Behold the symbol of salvation. By
this, conquer its enemies!'
`I will do it, if Heaven give me help,'
answered the young chief firmly, as he
kissed the cross.
`Now give it back to me, my son! I
take it from thy hand and bearing it aloft
in my own, I go forth to call the
mountains
and valleys beyond to its defence.
I will tell every man that Alfonzo the
Destroyer, the Saviour of Spain, hath
sent this cross to all who love Christ
Jesus, and calls upon them to come to
his standard, for the freedom of Spain!'
`And I, too, will go forth and rouse
the land!' cried Gaspar.
`Nay, father, I need thy council and
experience,' said Alfonzo. `Keep thou
at hand and aid me in bringing to a head
this great revolution that has been put
upon me. Thou shalt get together at
once our friends of the mountains and be
their chief until I am ready to lead them.
I have work to do, also; for there are
men to stir up whom I must see in
person
!
There are men, now slaves, in
Cordova who must be told of this, and
Spaniards who purchase their homes
from spoil with large tribute. These
must be told what is at work for Spain.
Be thou at the hamlet there to receive
and martial all who come to thee. Let
each one here who loves Spain give
himself
to the work. Let them go in every
path and defile of the mountains, let them
penetrate the gorges of the hills and
every nook of the plain. Let others, in
such disguises as can best secure their
safety, visit the valleys, and the towns in
them; and let the good news go from lip
to lip to all parts of the land! Within
thirty days, if we are true to ourselves,
Spain will be free and the Holy Cross
take the place of the fallen crescent.'
This address was received with deep
feeling by the three score hardy
mountaineers
who heard it, and after some
further particular directions, and some
cautions to move with secrecy and let
not a Moor's ear get the news of the
revolt
till the day of action arrived.
`We must see first my friends,' said
Alfonzo, as they were about separating,
each on his own mission to his
countrymen
,
`we must first see how many men
there are in Spain that wish to throw off
the Moslem yoke. We must not move
without being sure of conquest. In ten
days we can tell how large a force can
be depended on when the standard of the
Cross shall be lifted up. Each of you
will return to me within that time, and
you will find me at the rock of St. Paul's.
Vol. 2. Sig 3.
There shall I lift the Holy Sign of our
salvation when the day for its display
shall arrive. Till then let us advance
cautiously; for the Moor must be taken
in a snare, and unprepared to resist his
fate. You will each let me know how
many can be looked to to join us. Say
to all that by the day of St. James, the
cross will be lifted up and the blow
which is to break or rivet forever the
Moorish chains upon us, will be struck;
for my friends, few or many, to rally
around me, I shall raise the standard and
trust in God.'
The mountaineers now separated each
to the important duty assigned him by
their young chief. These men had all
been with Alfonzo on his gallant
expeditions
against the banditti of the Sierras,
and loved and honored him. They felt
that he was the only man to lead them
against their haughty couquerors. Their
spirit they resolved to infuse into the
souls of all who had not seen and known
their chief. The solemn consecration he
had received at the hands of the
Christian
hermit had its impression upon them.
After the ceremony, Gaspar had
informed
them that the cruse used and the oil
were the very same with which the last
King (for he had seen that ceremony)
had been consecrated by the archbishop,
for he knew the cruse again and
recognised
the fragrance of the ointment.
Alfonzo, Gaspar, the hermit,
Guiseppo
and Luis were left standing together
beneath the tree, Guiseppo holding by
the bridle his Arabian; they remained
silently watching the retiring figures of
their friends, as they went away in
various
paths, till all disappeared.
Now may Heaven send its blessing
with each one of those honest and brave
men,' said the hermit. `I foresee the
redemption of Spain, my children. The
voice which these patriots of the cross
will utter shall find an echo in every
Spanish
heart. The people only want a
leader, and they have one of themselves,
and one whom nobles will not disdain to
follow; for whose name in Spain is wider
known for valor than thine, my son.'
`I know that father,' cried Gaspar.
`But the boy is so modest he blushes at
praise, and I believe thinks no better of
himself than as if he had never done
anything but tending gazelles all his life.
Why, there is not a child in the land that
will not answer when asked who cut off
the head of El Zegris. It was Alfonzo
the Destroyer. What I have heard and
seen this day, father, has made me young
again. I forget my child in thinking of
what has followed her capture. She has
become a sacrifice to the freedom of
Spain.'
`Speak not thus, father! Xariffa is in
the hands of the Moor, and nothing can
lessen my grief at this reflection. Though
I should take Cordova at the head of my
countrymen, I should weep my sister
lost.'
`Thou shoulds think more of thy
country
than of the maiden, my son. Provi
dence hath ordered this, to bring good
out of evil. Thou mayest yet recover
her in safety. We all loved her. To
me she was very dear, and thou seest
tears are in my eyes, as well as thine,
while I speak of her. But it is not wise
to give way to useless grief. To
recover
her is impossible, till thou shalt take
her with thine own hand from the
Moslem
Harem, which doubtless will become
her prison. Give her to the care of the
good Saint, and give thy thoughts to thy
country.'
`I will do so, father. I should not have
waited till Xariffa was taken, ere I moved.
But I did not feel confidence in myself.
I now feel not confidence in myself, but
in the justice of the great cause to which
I am committed. I will forget Xariffa
till the hour comes when I can recover
or avenge her.'
`Which way now, my son?'
`I am going to Cordova.'
`It is madness; you will be slain.'
`I must do my work. I must not
shrink in the outset from danger. I must
stir up conspirators within its walls as
well as without.'
`Thou hast spoken wisely. How do
you go?'
`I shall go in the disguise of our foes.
I must use caution and subtlety. My
father has two or three Moorish costumes
in the hamlet, and one of these I'll put
on. Let us go thither.'
`Noble Alfonzo,' said Guesippo, `thou
art our chief. This horse becomes thee,
not me. I give him to thee.'
`Nay, I need him not.'
`But thou shalt take him, boy,' cried
Gaspar. `If thou art to disguise thyself
as a Moor, thou wilt carry it better in the
saddle than on foot. Guesippo, the
sturdy
rogue, needs no such luxury. Mount
him?'
`Thou, holy father,' said Alfonzo.
`No. It is thy place, my son. It is
not far to the hamlet, and I will walk
thither with Gaspar, and Luis, and
Guesippo
.'
Unable to resist, Alfonzo leaped into
the saddle, and sat the noble charger like
a prince.
`I go with you to Cordova,' said Luis,
coming to his stirrup, and speaking
earnestly
,
in a low tone. `I must see and
know where my Agata is.'
`Thou art needed to get together thy
friends, Luis. Thy presence, and sad
tale of wrong, will carry with it fire to all
who hear thee.'
`Wilt thou then seek her out, and learn
her fate?'
`As faithfully as I will do that of
Xariffa
.'
The young man pressed his hand with
gratitude. The whole party now
proceeded
towards the mountain gorge, in
the entrance to which the hamlet was
situated. Alfonzo rode on in advance,
with the hermit at his side; leaving
Gaspar
to collect and drive back half a score
of scattered kids which were wandering
away. When at length, Gaspar reached
his door with his companions, they were
not a little startled to behold what
seemed
to the eyes a Moor, come forth and
leap into the saddle of the Arabian, which
was standing at the door. A smile and
wave of the hand from him, to them,
caused Gaspar to exclaim,
`I had never supposed a Christian
would look so much like a Moor. By
the mass, boy, thou hadst like to have
had my boar-spear flying through the air
at your breast.'
`Is it a fair disguise friend?' asked
Alfonzo, as he rode up to them. `It is
needful that I should be wholly free from
suspicion. Look at me well.'
`Thou art a thorough Saracen,' cried
Guesippo.
`It is with much ado I could keep my
spear's point quiet,' said Gaspar. `If I
did not know thee I should swear thou
wert a son of the Prophet, like the rest
of them.'
`Then I will venture on my nightly
mission in this disguise,' answered
Alfonzo
,
with that serious, sad air which had
not divested his face for a moment, since
the capture of Xariffa. `In three days,
Gaspar, I will return hither, and tell thee
all how the hearts of men beat in
Cordova
;
for there are three thousand artizans
in the city, besides five thousand slaves,
and many rich Spaniards, who live only
at the will of the Moslem, by paying
heavy sums every montha state worse
than bondage. I shall move among all
these, and know how they will receive
the news of a revolution for the
over-throw
of the power of their masters.'
`In the meanwhile,' said Gaspar, `I
will be in your place here, to receive all
who come with arms to rally around
thee!'
`Farewell, my son,' said the hermit,
coming forth from the hut where he had
been with Alfonzo while he dressed; `I
go to carry this cross from hamlet to
hamlet, and call on every Christian to
flock to the standard of Liberty, for the
freedom of Spain from the curse of the
Crescent! But first I will walk a little
way by thy stirrup, for I have a few
words to say to thee touching Cordova
and thy visit thither!'
Luis now came up, and Guiseppo also,
and taking an affectionate leave of their
young chief, departed on their mission.
Gaspar embraced his son with emotion,
and commanding him to the grace and
protection of all good angels, retired
abruptly
into the cabin.
Alfonzo, dismounting, led his horse
down the path, while father Godfrey,
walking by his side, said,
`Before thou leavest me, my son, I
would commend thee to one in Cordova
whom thou wilt find ready to receive
thee, and to give his gold and his life for
Spain! It is the Signor Velez, once
high in authority when our old Spanish
Kings reigned; but who now lives in
outward
obscurity. Thou wilt find his house
the fourth door from the Mosque of
Omar, on the left hand. The outside of
the house is mean, but thou wilt find
hospitality
within. When thou appliest at
the door, place this little cross in the hand
of the master, and he will receive thee
without further question!'
As the hermit spoke he placed in the
hands of Alfonzo a small silver cross, on
which was graven in Hebrew the word
`Jehovah.'
`Thanks, kind father!' answered
Alfonzo
.
`I needed some place like this
to go to! Can I trust him fully with all
our plans?'
`Yes; thou wilt find him wearing, as
thou dost now, a Moorish dressfor
outwardly
he professes to be a Moslem, but
it is only a garb that he may be a spy
upon his foes. When shall we see thee
again?'
`In three days at the farthest, father,'
answered Alfonzo; `I shall see who will
be with us there, and then return to learn
how the people of the Sierras look upon
the effort about to be made to throw off
the yoke of the Moor.'
`I will soon after that be with thee.
Fear notdoubt not, my son! Spain
only wants a leader, and thou art he
whom God has given to it. Now fare
thee well, and the blessing of Heaven go
with thee and prosper thee, my son!'
The hermit now pressed the hand of
his young friend, turned silently away,
and with his staff in his hand walked
rapidly
into the forest northward. Alfonzo
looked after him for a moment with a
longing farewell glance; and then said
with a kindling eye, as he pressed his
horse forward,
`Now for Cordova, to plot its down
fall! Xariffa, thou shalt be avenged!
Spain, thou shalt yet be free!'
CHAPTER X.
THE YOUNG VINE-DRESSER.
The
route of our youthful chief lay,
for a mile and a half, directly through the
heart of a dark forest, crossed in every
direction, by paths worn by muleteers
and woodmen. There was one tolerably
straight path, but narrow, which led from
the foot of the mountain, near the
hamlet
,
in the direction of the Guadelquiver.
Alfonzo galloped forward, for about a
mile, without drawing rein. He was
surprised
to see two wood-gatherers
suddenly
fly from the road on seeing him; but,
when he recollected that he wore the
Moorish attire, he saw the reason of their
flight, and sighed at the new proof of
the degradation of his countrymen.
`It is time Spain rose and asserted her
right to be a nation of freemen. We
have been slaves so long, we tremble at
the sight of a turban. But there shall be
a change soon, if my countrymen are true
to themselves. It may be that they will
refuse to recognise my claim to be their
leader. But if one among them will
stand up and raise the standard of the
cross, I will follow him. But there seems
no one ready; all my friends look to me.
Even my father turns to me and bids me
take the lead. It is true I have done
something to aid my countrymen; and
it is true that in Xariffa's capture, I have
endured an outrage, that seems to call
on me to act whether others move or not
and this I will do. I know not what the
holy hermit meant by pouring that cruice
of fragrant oil upon my head. How
solemnly
it was done. There seemed to
be a deep meaning in it: gladly would I
have asked him, but I feared he would
think I thought too much upon the
circumstance
.
There was, doubtless, some
sacred virtue in the ointment. I do,
indeed
,
feel that I am set apart for this great
work: and will the thousands of Spain,
now in bondage, rise at my call upon
them? Will Spain consent to be made
free by the hands of a peasant? The
nobles may mock, but the peasantry will
follow me, and so if I achieve liberty for
these I am content. There is the road
which turns off towards the Emir's tower.
I will take it on my way, and know what
hath become of Genilla. Her nation will
protect her from the outrages which
Christian maidens suffer. But I would
know if she is returned in safety from
Cordova.'
He had ridden but a few rods in the
new path he had taken, when he beheld
before him two Moorish vine-dressers,
driving an ass laden with grapes in
panniers
.
He felt that now his disguise
would have a fair test, without much
danger
,
even should it fail, as he was well
armed with daggers and a scymetar,
while they carried only their staves
sharpened with an iron pike, the usual
arms of both the Moorish and Spanish
peasantry.
As he rode towards them, he saw them
commence driving and pushing the ass
out to one side of the path, to give room
for him to ride by, their harsh cries and
blows making the forest echo again. His
costume was that of a Moorish officer, of
the rank of a captain, and as to it he had
added a green silk turbanthe sacred
color of the Prophettaken from one of
his former Moorish prisoners, he carried
with him authority and power.
The two men got their ass to one side
of the way, and there held him, as
Alfonzo
rode by. They both made a profound
salaam
with their faces to the ground as
he passed. To be sure that they saw him
well, he reined up, and asked in good
Arabic, for the language of their
conquerors
was mostly spoken by the men of
Spain, their proud conquerors disdaining
to learn the tongue of the vanquished.
`Hast thou seen a party of Zenetan
horse pass through the forest?'
`Three hours ago, most noble
Effendi
,'
answered one of the Moors.
`Hah! How large a force?'
`About sixty horsemen; and they had
a captive Christian lady with them!'
`Did they ride on to Cordova?'
`Yes, most excellent Effendi; but it
was not on this road, but by the one to
the West.'
Satisfied that he might now safely
venture
into Cordova, Alfonzo left them
with the indifference of manner
characteristic
of the Moor, who never thanks
an inferior, and galloped rapidly
forward
in the direction of the Emir's tower.
He soon came in sight of its lofty,
ruinous
hattlements over-topping the trees,
and in a few minutes afterwards reined
cautiously up under the wall; for he did
not care to come suddenly or
unnecessarily
upon any Moors, who might chance
to be about the tower, or upon Ben
Osmin
himself, if he should be at home.
The tower, as we have said, stood upon
a shoulder of a low projecting point of
the Sierra, and covered the whole rock,
save a narrow path-way around the base,
which led to a level, green platform in
the rear, half an acre in extent, and
overhung
by the mountain. In this
sheltered
elevation, upon a level with the wall
of the tower, stood, with its front to the
latter, the little vine-trellised cottage of
Ben Osmin, the retired Moorish captain
of the sea.
Up this path, just described, Alfonzo
slowly rode, carefully watching for the
appearance of any one. But he
reached
the top of the platform and came in
sight of the Kasah, without seeing any
one. Here he dismounted, and led his
horse into the area of the tower, to drink
at a pool which he saw there, resolving
afterwards to enter the dwelling; for he
knew that there dwelt there with Ben
Osmin and his daughter, an old Moorish
woman as house-keeper, who was partly
blind and a cripple, but nevertheless, as
Ben Osmin said of her to his friends, a
notable body to take care of a house, and
wait on 'nilla.
He entered the court of the tower, and
dismounted. The day being hot, and all
still around, the young chief removed
from his head his ample green turban,
and laid it upon a stone, displaying upon
his brow a sort of low helmet, or
coronet
of singular beauty, being eight sided,
and made of fine steel, inlaid with gold.
He then threw aside his long white
muslin
Moorish robe, and appeared clad in a
handsome surcoat of mail, with a
crimson
sash about his waist, and hanging
from a strap across his shoulder,
appeared
the gigantic scymetar of the Ethiop,
whom he had slain in the fortress of El
Zegris.
This costume had been given him in
the hut by the hermit, who had taken
it from a box in Xariffa's apartment where
he said he had long kept it, for this very
purpose, and insisted on his wearing
both the helmet and the cuirass, beneath
his Moorish robes
`For,' said he, `thou art a leader, and
thou shouldest wear armour becoming a
chief; and the armour will protect thy
life if thou art assailed. Besides, I have
my reasons why thou shouldest wear it
when thou comest to lead the Christian
host!'
`Then I will put it on, not now,
father
,'
answered Alfenzo.
`Now, my son is the time to put it on!
Thou mayest be called suddenly from
Cordova, and to throw off thy Moorish
dress to take the lead in the revolt. I
would have thee appear well. Wear
these by my command!'
`I obey!' answered Alfonzo, and put
ting them on he was surprised how well
they fitted him, as if made for him!'
`Said I not I kept them for thee, my
son,' answered the Monk with a proud
and gratified smile. `Yet they were
not made for thee! But now put on thy
Moorish garb. I would not Gaspar should
see thee in this guise just now. How
noble thy bearing. I love to gaze on
thee as thou now appearest! I could
almost kneel to thee, my son! But not
now, not now! First break in pieces
the chains of thy country!'
`I must have a sword becoming such
brave armour as this, father! I see
none that will serve me but this of the
Ethiop. It is of Damascus steel, and
tempered finely. It is well worthy of a
prince, much less a peasant. I will bind
it on, for I shall need it, if Spain comes
to the rescue of her altars and her homes,
as I believe she will!'
`Believe it, my son! If the land hears
thee not because thou art of humble birth,
I will give thee a talisman that will draw
every heart unto thee! Quickly on with
thy turban and robe, for I hear the
footsteps
and voice of Gaspar approaching!
In a few moments the knightly looking
young man was completely transformed
into a Saracen, in turban and bernish.
`Now, holy father,' said Alfonzo,
going out to mount his horse, `I leave
with thee my gazelles, and especially this
kid of Xariffa, who so plaintively misses
his mistress. The herd-boy will look to
them, but while thou art here see to him
that he neglects them not; for this is to
be thy home!'
The next instant he was in his saddle,
and met Gaspar and his friends, as we
have seen.
Having now laid aside his warm
Moorish
costume in the lonely court of the
tower, to resume again when he should
remount his horse, he led the noble
animal
towards the pool to let him drink,
and at the same time to cool his own
brow and hands. He came to the pool
which was at the end of a low wall that
intersected the tower, and was about to
let him drink, when a young man,
habited
in the ordinary garb of a Moorish
mountaineer, with a short wolf-knife in
his belt, came suddenly out from the
wall and stood before him, gazing into
his face with curiosity and fearless
surprise
.
Alfonzo instantly recognised him and
called him by his name.
`What, art thou here, Athir?'
`And am I not then mistaken?' cried
the young man, with a countenance
brightening with pleasure. `I knew that
I could not be deceived in my
benefactor's
face, even under a knight's helm!'
`What art thou doing here? And lo!
this water in the pool is crimson! My
horse snuffs it and revolts at it!' cried
Alfonzo, in the same breath in which he
questioned him; and pointing to the pool,
he looked steadily in his face, and asked,
`Hast thou slain any man? Hast
thou cast a Christian in here to conceal
the deed of blood, Moor? Speak!'
The youth stood up and looked him
firmly and unwaveringly in the face, and
with a noble air of innocence answered,
`No, I have not slain a Christian. For
thy sake, I am their friend! The body
that lies there is the body of a Moslem!'
`And wherefore did you quarrel?'
`He was a Moor who had followed El
Zegris when thou didst save my life and
gave it to me when I looked only for
death at thy hands!'
`I pitled thy youth, Athir. I warred
only with El Zegris and his hardy men
of war!'
`I have not forgotten thy mercy.
How thou didst take me to the good
hermit's
cave, give him charge to heal my
wound; and then, when I recovered, you
suffered me to depart in peace. For this
thy image has been daily before me;
and for this I would lose my life to serve
thee. This robber Moor came hither,
for I have of late been hired by Ben
Osmin
to help him in his vineyard, and
would have got me to join him by threats
to show him the cave of the hermit; for
he said men had told him that there was
much Christian gold concealed in the
cell of the hermit, and he meant to
plunder
it and carry it away!'
`The father hath but a cross and a
cup of silver! He is poor, save in the
riches of virtue, Athir!'
`So I told the Moor; but he would not
believe me. He said he would go alone
and would rob the hermit though he had
to slay him. So he would have left me;
but I held him, when he aimed a stroke
at me with his scymetar. I wrested it
from him and slew him and cast his body
into the pool. Thus have I saved the
life of the venerable Christian who healed
me and sent me away in peace, though
an enemy to his race!'
`Thou hast done a good deed, Athir,'
said Alfonzo to the youth, who had been
a page to El Zegris and whose life he
had spared when he first attacked and
drove the robber-chief from the mountains.
Athir had received a wound in the
conflict
and would have been slain by one
of Alfonzo's band but for his
interposition
.
He took him with him to the cell of
father Godfrey, and when he was healed
sent him home to Cordova, where Athir
told him he had a mother and sister
living. But there he met again with El
Zegris, who would have forced him into
his service, but Athir fled and became a
vine-dresser in the valley, and finally
had been hired by Ben Osmin to aid him
in dressing his vineyard.
CHAPTER XI.
THE YOUTHFUL MOOR.
The
young Moor having related to
Alfonzo the events as they have just been
given, and received his commendation
for what he had done in thus destroying
a dangerous enemy of the father Godfrey,
said,
`Though the pool is crimsoned with
the robber's blood, I will lead the horse
where he can find water. There is a
fountain behind the kasah that flows
from the rock.'
Alfonzo knew well the fountain. It
was there he had his last meeting with
Genilla the evening previous to her
departure
for Cordova with her father,
contrary
to her lover's wishes; for Alfonzo
had no wish to place her in the way of
the lawless young Saracen cavaliers, and
so let her see that there were good
looking
young men in the world besides
himself
.
`You may take him there, Athir.
Does Ben Osmin yet linger in the city?'
`Yes, Effendi. He left, it is now the
third day, with the fair Genilla his
daughter
,
the captain riding his brown ass
gaily caparisoned, and Genilla mounted
behind him upon a pillion. They went
with the sun-rising.'
`And have you heard from them?'
asked Alfonzo, as he walked with him
towards the trough, which was a hollow
stone beneath the fountain.
`Not a word. They were to go to the
house of Ben Habib, the turban-maker,
who I believe is a cousin of Ben Osmin;
at least they are great friends.'
`Dost thou know on what street in
Cordova this Ben Habib lives?' inquired
Alfonzo, as they stopped at the fountain
and let the horse drink of the refreshing
water as it gushed alive from the rock.
`It is the street known as the street of
the gate of Mecca. Thou wilt know the
place by the sign of a red turban.'
`I thank theeI will find it.'
`Thou art not going into Cordova?'
exclaimed Athir with surprise.
`Yes.'
`Thou wilt be slainCordova is filled
with thy enemies!'
`I know it.'
`Go not, my lord; do not put thyself
in the way of death! For my sake
remain
,
and rush not upon the scymetars of
my countrymen!'
`Dost thou then feel such interest in
me, Athir?' said Alfonzo, regarding him
keenly.
`Do I?Thou art dearer to me than
any one! Art thou not the saviour of
my life?do I not live by thee?do I
not stand here for thee? I am thine
not my own; and dost thou ask me if I
love thee?'
`This is gratitude, indeed!' exclaimed
Alfonzo, as he raised the youth from his
knees, upon which he had fallen as he
spoke, bowing his head upon his hand,
as if grieved that his grateful affection
for the preserver of his life should for a
moment be questioned. `I will trust
thee!'
`Thou shouldst do it, my lord; I slew
a Moor, my own countryman, because he
would have wronged the hermit, thy
friend! I would slay myself if I thought
that one throb of my heart could beat
false to thee. Go not to Cordova!'
`Wilt thou go with me?'
`I will if thou wilt let meI will be
thy faithful shadow. If thou goest to
Cordova, I will be by thy side to protect
theeto die with thee! But go not
thither, my lord!'
`I must;thou shalt go also.'
`Allah be praised!'
`Listen, Athir: I believe that you love
me, and can be trusted.'
`Thou shalt prove me!' answered the
youth with enthusiasm.
`But thou art a MoslemI a
Christian
,canst
thou serve me, and forget
both?'
`I can.'
`Then listen: my sister Xariffa, as
beautiful and good as an angel of
Paradise
,
and whom you saw once with me
in the hermit's cell, has this day been
torn from my home by a party of sixty
Zenetan horse, the household cavalry of
Abdelasis.'
`May Allah curse them!' cried the
Moor with flashing eyes. `I remember
her, my lord: fair as a houri. Her
gentle
smile warmed my breast. Has the
Zenetan horse become banditti?'
`I know not, unless they were sent by
Abdelasis for this special capture.' This
indeed had at last come to be Alfonzo's
opinion, the more his mind dwelt upon
the subject. In the first place, the
Zenetan
cavalry, which were the finest
horsemen
and best soldiers in Barbary, and
had always constituted the royal
body-guard
of Emir and Caliph, had made this
capture. They had no sooner
accomplished
it than they galloped back to
Cordova
with their prize. He recollected,
too, that his sister had said that she had
seen him asleep: and, recalling the words
he had heard fall from his lips when he
waked, he believed that he had seen her.
This belief now led him to suspect his
agency in her capture.
`I am going into the city in hopes to
find my sister,' added Alfonzo, who did
not see fit to unfold to him all his motives
in visiting Cordova. `I am willing to
confide in thee for a companion, knowing
well that I may trust my life in thy
hands.'
`My lord, thou knowest that I would
die to save thine.'
`Thou shalt then go with me, and
perhaps
thou mayest serve me. Ben
Osmin's
vineyard will not suffer for thy
absence
a day or two, and doubtless he will
be at home to-night or to-morrow.'
`I will send a man who dwells in the
valley a mile hence to look after it,'
answered
Athir with enthusiasm. `I am
happy to know thou wilt let me go with
thee. I will serve thee. I will try and
rescue Xariffa for thee. I will do
whatsoever
thou biddest me doonly that I
may be with thee.'
`Wilt thou keep sacredly the secret
that I am a Christian?'
`I will, my lord. But men will see
that thou art one.'
`True, if I wear this garb; but I am
not going into Cordova in this costume.
Come with me, Athir, and I will show
thee what I shall wear as a protection
against discovery.'
Thus speaking, Alfonzo led his horse,
and conducted the Moorish youth back to
the ruin, within which he pointed out to
him, lying upon a rock, the Moslem
turban
and bernish which he had left there.
He put them on, and then, turning to the
surprised youth, said,
`Am I not safe under this disguise,
even in Cordova?'
`Thou art, my lord. I should believe
thee none other than a Moorish officer of
one of the Emir's household.'
`So I would be considered. Thou must
address me as Ali Ahmet.'
`I will not forget it, my lord.'
`Then thou shalt go with me; but I
ride. Thou canst not keep up with me.
But I can adapt the pace of my horse to
thine.'
`I am swift of foot as a deer, my lord.
I will run by thy side.'
`It is, then, that I go into Cordova as
a Moorish officer, Ali Ahmet, and thou
mymywhat shall I saycompanion?
lieutenant?'
`Servant, my lord.'
`Nay, I am but a peasant. I know no
slaves. Yet be it so for the present.'
Alfonzo now glanced at the sun, and
seeing that it was but an hour high, he
resolved to proceed without delay to
Cordova, as he knew the gates would be
shut at sun-down.
He therefore bade Athir take his staff
and come with him.
`I must go in and get my kaftan and
turban, my lord,' answered the young
man; and, going into the house, after a
few minutes' absence, he returned with a
white lawn turban folded about his brows,
and a dark brown kaftan that reached to
his knees, and at the waist was confined
by a leathern belt, in which was stuck a
pruning-knife. Sandals were bound
upon
his feet, and in his hand he grasped a
stout staff, shod with sharp-pointed steel.
`I am ready, my lord,' he said, in a
frank, cheerful tone, as if he was happy
to be in the way of showing his gratitude
to his benefactor.
`There is yet one good hour left for us
to reach the gates before they close. The
distance is still more than two leagues.
Canst thou go so fast?'
`I could run it in much less time, my
lord,' answered the youth with
animation
,
as together they descended the steep
path which wound round the front of the
tower. At length they found themselves
in the open road that crossed the valley
of the Guadalquivir. For the first mile
their path lay through the bosom of the
forest that everywhere belted the region
where the sierra fell into the plain.
Alfonzo
rode at an easy pace through the
wood, the youthful Moor striding at his
horse's head with an agile and easy air.
`Thou art used to exercising thy
limbs, Athir. One would take thee for a
Christian mountaineer. It would put me
to task to keep pace with thee.'
`I have been a mountaineer, senor,'
answered the Moor. `In Barbary, where
I was born, are ranges of lofty
mountains
;
and on one of these, for centuries,
lived my fathers, who were herdsmen
and hunters. From a boy, till I could
draw a bow, I was reared among the
hills. But four years ago I left Barbary
in the train of Algezir the Emir, to seek
my fortune in this fair land, which our
songs said flowed with golden rivers, and
over which arched skies of sapphire.
`But friendly I was hardly served in
the Emir's household, who had made me
his page, and one day being struck by a
Eunuch, I slew him and fled to the
mountains here. El Zegris was then in
the height of his power as a robber chief,
and in my wanderings I came upon his
strong-hold. He made me a prisoner,
but afterwards took me into his service.
When, at length, he was driven from his
fortresses by you, my brave lord, I fell
into your hands, and you spared my life,
which life is now yours!'
`How came you to leave Barbary,
Athir? Why not remain in your
mountains
of the Moor, as I think they are
called, with thy fathers?'
`Thou shalt know, senor,' answered
Athir, after a moment's hesitation, and
colouring deeply. `I will speak of it
to thee, my lord. My father was poor,
but still he had in his veins princely
blood. Still we were very poor and I
tended my father's goats, our only
subsistence
!'
`Then we are brethren in occupation,
Athir!'
`I shall never be higher than I am
thou wilt be great, and men will yet
honor
thee greatly, signor! The chief of
our tribe had a fair daughter, Nube,
sixteen
years of age, with eyes like twin
stars shining at midnight, and a face as
beautiful as an angel's. I loved her afar
off, and worshipped her in my heart.
She discovered, I know not how, that I
loved her, and we met, and together
wandering by the soft moonlight, told our
loves and were happy. But, at length,
the proud chief was told that his
beautiful
daughter was loved by the son of
one of his herdsmen. He called her,
and she confessed it; and by a faithful
slave sent me word to fly. I obeyed,
though with a sad heart at leaving her
forever! It was thus that I came to
Spain!'
`And hast thou not heard from the
fair Arabian girl? Art thou ignorant of
her fate?' asked Alfonzo with deep
interest
in his simple story.
`I know nothing, senor,' answered the
youth, sadly. `I am ignorant whether
she lives or fell a victim to her father's
anger!'
`I sympathise with thee, Athir! But
see! what comes here?' he suddenly
exclaimed
,
as a cloud of dust rose in the
valley before them along a cross road
that led from the upper or western
extremity
of the valley.
It rolled along the line of the road
which intersected theirs, but the persons
were concealed by the hedge rows and
gardens between; for our two travellers
were now riding in the open valley,
having
left the forest some distance behind
them. About their road, as they went,
the country was beautiful with cottages,
villages with white towers, or here and
there a minaret peeping out above the
trees; with gardens and vineyards, and
pleasant meadows chequered with groves.
There were two principal roads which
wound through the valley, one of which
they were now on, and which led directly
to Cordova, and the other intersected it
from the east, and was that along which
rolled the cloud of dust which had called
Alfonzo's attention.
It is a troop, my lord, I see the tops of
their lances glancing above the hedges
and dust,' said Athir. `Let us turn aside.'
`No, we are too nigh them now. If I
expect to be admitted into Cordova as a
Moor, I must not fear a party of Moorish
horse in the high way. I will keep on,
trusting in my disguise. Walk with thy
hand upon my horse, Athir, as if thou
wert a slave.'
`My lord, feign thyself deaf, and let
me answer for thee, if thou art
questioned
.'
`If it will please thee, Athir, I will do
so; for I have too much at stake to risk
my liberty lightly.'
CHAPTER XII.
THE SARACEN CAVALRY.
The
cloud of moving dust now
suddenly
resolved itself, as they entered the
road in which Alfonzo travelled, into a
brilliant corps of cavalry, crossing the
valley at full speed. Their number was
not less than eighty. Upon entering the
road they wheeled to the left and
advanced
at the same pace towards
Cordova
,
as Athir thought, without seeing him
or his master, as he chose to term
Alfonzo
.
`This is a good oversight for us, my
lord. They might have been too
inquisitive
had they discovered you and chose
to wait for us to join them.'
`See! Three of them in the rear
have suddenly turned their horses'
heads and gallop back. They have seen
us. They wave their scymetars as they
spur on.'
`Now, my lord, may Allah keep thee,'
said Athir, with much alarm.
`Fear not, Athir. I will manage them.
They come in hostile attitudes; but they
know not whether I am foe or friend.
Even the Moors fear each other since
this revolution, which has broken up so
many factions. Now keep thee quiet, and
let us move gently on and meet them.'
The three horsemen, glittering in silks
and polished steel harness, with gleaming
scymetars, came up like the wind,
abreast; but as they came nigh Alfonzo,
seeing that he betrayed neither fear nor
hostility, they reined up, and trotting
gently along, met him and saluted him.
`Allah be with thee, brother,' said
the foremost.
`Allah be thy guide also, brother,'
answered
Alfonzo, in spite of the appealing
glance of the faithful Athir, who would
have replied in his stead.
`Comest thou far on this road?' asked
the Saracen cavalier.
`Not many miles, brother. What
band is this before me?'
`It is a party of the Caliph's guard, as
thou seest I am by my apparel and
turban
.
We have been to the mountains on
the east of the valley to attack a party of
Algezir's men, who had thrown
themselves
into a castle there.'
`I thought all the true followers had
submitted to Abdelasis,' said Alfonzo.
`All but these men. They hoped, by
fortifying themselves there, to defy the
Caliph, and by and by getting the
disaffected
,
the robbers and renegades to
their standard, avenge one day their
chief's death.'
`What leader had they?'
`Who but El Zegris, the Eblis of all
mischief in Andalusia,' answered the
officer
with a frown.
`El Zegris!' exclaimed Alfonzo and
Athir in the same breath.
`Yes. Your slave seems to speak as
if he knew him.'
`He was once his prisoner,' answered
Alfonzo. `And did you attack the
castle
?'
`Yes; but without success. The
one-handed
chief was everywhere inspiring
his men, and we had to retire; but we
are only returning to Cordova for a
reinforcement
.
If that brave Christian,
Alfonzo
the mountaineer, had slain this
great robber instead of only cutting off
his hand, he would have done us and all
Spain good service.'
`He spared him, because he thought
it would be a greater punishment to such
a manso men say,' answered Alfonzo.
`Punishment, indeed! It has been
but little to him; for he lashes his sword
to his club-wrist as if with bonds of iron,
and thus wields it with a power that no
man can withstand. It is a terrible steel
arm and fatal to all that come within its
sweep.'
`It is to be regretted, since this is so,
that he was not killed out-right.
`Allah be praised! we shall not want
a force to send against him; now
Abdelasis
reigns. He hates El Zegris, for some
early encounter they have had: and he
will give us troops enough to destroy
him.'
`Who is chief of this party to which
you belong?' asked Alfonzo.
`It is Aben Haphel, a nephew, thou
knowest, of Taric. Wilt thou ride on?'
`I ride slow to accommodate my slave,'
answed Anfonzo; for while they had
been conversing they had been riding
along, the horseman being on Alfonzo's
right, while his two companions, who
were inferior in rank, rode in the rear.
`There are three empty saddles in the
party, their riders having been slain. Thy
slave shall ride one, and so make it
easier for him and the soldiers who are
leading them. Go forward, Hammel,
and bring hither from the troop one of
the led horses.'
The soldier gallopped on ahead after
the body of cavalry, and soon coming up
with them, took a richly caparisoned
steed by the bridle, with which a Moor
was leading him, and returning, met the
officer and Alfonzo. Athir leapt lightly
into the saddle, and falling back in the
rear of all, as he knew it became him to
do, as a `slave,' he saw, not without
alarm, Alfonzo and the officer prepare
to gallop on and overtake the troop.
`You had better,' said the officer, `
enter
the gates with us, for they will
without
doubt be closed when we get to them;
and to you alone they would not be
opened
.'
`You are very courteous, Effendi,'
answered Alfonzo. `I will avail myself
of the privilege.'
`Come you from the north, brother?'
asked the officer.
`As I said, not far. But a few miles.'
`How do the Christians, if thou hast
spoken with any, like the accession of
Abdelasis?'
`They little heed the changes in our
government, brother. It is the same to
them who rules: a slave, you know has
no choice in masters.'
`True. But they should see in this
new government of Abdelasis that the
power of our people is to increase and
become greater than before; and with
our greatness they must see that they will
fall lower still.'
`They see it. But they have been
broken down by a score of years of
slavery
to theto
us
, and have little heed
how things now go. May I ask who
thou art brother?'
`I am Ali Ben Sarac, brother to
Ibrahim
,
who is the Reis Effendi under the
new Caliph,' answered the youthful
officer
;
and I am second in command of
the troops to which we are now so near.
Thy name and rank?'
`Ali Ahmet, a captain, but not in
service
now.'
`Dost thou go to Cordova to seek
service
with Abdelasis?'
`I may see the Prince; but I fear he
would not grant me a place, such as
would please me!'
`Fear not. He means to call around
his person all the bravest men in Spain.
Ibrahim told me that he would not
hesitate
to make an officer of rank even of
the valiant Christian Alfonzo, if he could
induce him to take service with him. But
they say this Chief is as proud as he is
poor; and there is little hope that
Abdelasis
will ever get his services
otherwise
than by making him his slave.'
`The Christians have little reason to
love their conquerors.'
`That is true, brother. But we shall
have them all good Mussulmen soon.
Thou hast heard of the great Decree of
the new Caliph? which calls on
Christians
to register their names before him
ere thirty days expire.'
`Yes, I have heard it.'
`Those who, after registering their
names, shall refuse to worship in the
Mosque Omar, are to have their left ear
clipped, the forefinger of the right hand
cut off, and to be sold in the bazanrs to
the highest bidder. By Allah, these
Christians are so stubborn that I see we
shall be overrun with slaves; every
artisan
will be as rich as an Emir.'
`Think you the Christians will come
in to undergo this degradation?' asked
Alfonzo, with an effort repressing the
exhibition of the emotions to which this
conversation gave rise.
`What help have they? Abdelasis has
all the power in the land. He has
consolidated
the empire. He has no rivals
no factions to contend withwhen this
El Zegris is slain or taken, as he will
soon be. The Caliph can, therefore, fill
the mountains and valleys of Spain with
his soldiers. With sword and fire they
can kill and destroy all who resist.
Unless
the Christians wish to be
exterminated
,
they will not resist the decree!'
`You believe, then, that they will come
in to be registered?'
`To a man.'
`Think you Alfonzo the mountaineer
will come too?'
`No, he will stay away! If he comes,
he is not the man that I suppose him to
be. He will no doubt fly to the
fortresses
of the mountains with others as
bold as himself, and there defy the
soldiers
of the Caliph. I would give the
richest diamond on the crescent of the
Caliph, were it mine, to see this Alfonzo!'
`Possibly he may come into Cordova
and be registered!'
`Should he do so, he will hardly leave
it again. Abdelasis would give much to
hold him in his hands.'
`Think you he will go so far as to
slit the ears and cut off the fingers of all
who, after having registered their names,
shall refuse to offer sacrifice in the
Mosque?'
`There is no doubt of it. He means
to make Spain a Moslem Empire. There
shall not, he says, exist in Spain two
nations, and one of these Christians. The
only distinction shall be master and slave;
and the Christian, if he refuses to become
a follower of the Prophet, shall be made
a bondman. But here we are up with
my troop!'
`It is a gallant company. Some of
your people, I see, are wounded, by the
blood-stained bandages they wear?'
`Yes; we lost four killed, and have
seven wounded, but not badly. The
Zegris
defended his castle bravely.
To-morrow
,
ere the sun-set, we shall once
more storm his defences. It will take
four hundred men to do it. I shall ask
Abdelasis to give me command of the
division; and if thou choosest to give
thy scymetar something to do, thou
shalt have an honorable place in my
troop!'
`Thanks, Effendi. I go to Cordova
only on matter of business, and for the
present care not to engage in any
expeditions
of warfare. I thank thee,
nevertheless
,
for thy courteous offer. You
said right that I should hardly get to the
gate before sun-set. The sun is now
close to the horizon, and we are yet full
two miles distant from the walls. To go
in with thy company will be a privilege;
for, not having any friends in the valley,
I should not care to lodge in the
caravansera
outside the gate, when, at such a
stirring time as this, many lawless bands
must be strolling about the suburbs!'
The Moorish cavalry to which Alfonzo
had now attached himself, and very
gladly too, as affording him a way of
entering
the city unquestioned, had now got
within full view of the city, which stood
in all its oriental splendor upon the banks
of the Guadalquivira pile of palaces,
mosques, domes and crowning minarets,
which reflected back with the brilliancy
of needles of polished gold, the setting
sun. The groves of palm that grew near
the walls, the lofty walls themselves, with
their bastions and towers, the noble river
flowing around and half-embracing them,
with the soft, mellow, roseate tint of the
atmosphere, hanging like a veil over all,
presented to the eye of the young
gazelle-keeper
,
as he rode along the road by the
side of the Moorish lieutenant, a scene
that delighted and enchanted him.
As they drew nearer, their road lay
amid a vale of gardens, the fragrance
from which loaded the air, and almost
oppressed the senses, Birds sang in the
orange groves, and flew from spray to
spray above the heads of the prancing
horsemen, like brilliant flowers on the
wing.
They passed the open gates of Moorish
villas, where, upon rich mats, sat the
master of the house, surrounded by his
family, listening to music, or being
entertained
with the graceful motions of
the Xeri, or Arabian dancing-girls.
They passed horsemen and mulattoes,
and labourers, hurrying homeward, ere
night should set in, and were passed by
riders at full speed, who feared they
should not reach the city in time, before
the closing of the gates: but the
commander
of the troop neither mended his
pace, nor betrayed anxiety; as he knew
that the gates, though shut, would be
thrown open to him, as soon as he should
appear before them.
CHAPTER XIII.
THE STREETS OF CORDOVA.
About
half a mile from the walls, the
road along which the party of horsemen
was in motion struck the broad river,
and turned city-ward along its banks.
The shades of evening were already
deepening the hue of the heavens, when
they came te the foot of the slight
ascent
,
which led up to the principal gate.
It was already closed, and about it was
gathered some score of travellers of all
ranks and pursuits, who had been shut
out for the night. Among them were
two Hadji or pilgrims, as their garb
showed
.
One of them was a man of tall
appearance
,
with an air that was singularly
noble, though his dress was coarse, and
his feet were bare. The other was more
youthful, slighter in person, and seemed
to retire from the observation of the
Moorish captain, as the elder Hadji
stepped
forth and saluted him.
`My lord,' said the Hedji, extending
his arm towards the leader of the corps,
as he rode up and waved his hand to the
officer of the gate, who stood upon its
summit, to admit him and his troop.
`Well, holy pilgrim from the tomb of
the prophet, what wouldst thou?'
`Permission to enter under thy
protection
.
We have travelled far a-foot,
and need repose, and were but a minute
too late.'
`Thou hast asked what I will gladly
grant thee, pilgrim. Touch my
scyme-tar
,
and give it power against the
Infidel
!'
The pilgrim laid his hand upon the
naked blade for a moment and
murmured
a few words, kissed it, and then stood
back.
`My lord, wilt thou permit me also to
go in?' cried a merchant of Catalan,
holding the bridle of his laden mule as he
humbly approached the chief. `I have
rich wares in my packs, and I am told
robbers are abroad.'
`What wilt thou pay me, merchant?'
asked the haughty Moslem officer,
extending
his open palm.
`I am very poor, my lordI can give
thee but little.'
`Poor! didst thou not but now say thy
packs were filled with rich goods. Thou
art a liar, and deservest the bastinado.
Give me a gold moid for suffering thee
to go in with me.'
`There it is, my lord Effendi,'
answered
the merchant, cheerfully taking the
coin from his pouch, and laying it upon
the palm of the officer's hand.
`Good! Now pay me two gold sheken
for thy lie!'
`Oh, my lord!'
`Not a word!Be quick, for you
delay
the captain of the gate, who waits
for me to go through.'
`There it is, my lord.'
`
Two!
I said not one,'
`There, my lord.'
`Hold: I have not done with thee yet.
Pay me three golden tekel for not taking
thy goods from thee, for lying to an
officer
of the Caliph!'
`Allah be merciful!' ejaculated the
poor merchant; `I shall be robbed!' and
he began to count the gold with
trembling
fingers.
`Dost thou call me a robber?' Make
it five tekel, rogue of a merchant.
Hesitate, and I will take off thy head!'
The merchant paid the gold, and then
with misgiving stepped back:but the
commander had done with him. Two
or three others, who had pressed forward
for permission to enter, on seeing these
proceedings, drew back in silence,
preferring
to run the risk of being plundered
by the robbers without, than the
certainty
of being robbed at the gate.
The Moorish officer now spurred
forward
and galloped through the arch
gate-way
between files of soldiers, who
saluted
him as he went by.
Alfonzo passed in with Ali-ben-Sarac,
the friendly lieutenant who rode in the
rear of the troop; and close behind him
galloped Athir; after these came the
Catalan
merchant, and the two Hadjii, and
one or two others. The gates were then
closed by a loud command from the
captain
of the guard, and Alfonzo found
himself
within the city of his foes, without
hope of escape, save by his address,
courage, and the excellency of his
disguise
.
`Which way do you ride?' asked
Aliben-Sarac
,
as they rode swiftly up the
main street which led from the gate to
the great square of the Mosque of Omar.
`I shall go to some caravansera,'
answered
Alfonzo. `I thank thee for thy
courtesy to me, a stranger.'
`No Moor who wears the green turban
is a stranger to a true follower of the
Prophet, brother. Besides, did I not see
by thy air and bearing that thou wert of
good birth and rank. If thou wilt ride
to the Caliph's palace I will insure thee a
good reception from Abdelasis, if thou
wilt take service with him. Under what
Emir hast thou served as captain?'
`Under none of late;as I said, I am
now a private citizen. I must, therefore,
beg leave to decline your kind invitation.
I will now bid thee good night, and pray
that to-morrow El Zegris may fall into
thy hands. Athir, dismount and give the
soldier by thee the horse he has given
thee to ride so long.'
Athir obeyed, throwing the rein to the
Moor and taking Alfonzo's horse by the
bit; for he had reined up, seeing that
they had come to a cross street, down
which he thought it best to turn to get rid
of going to the palace with the
kindly-disposed
Ali Sarac.
`Then if thou goest no farther, Allah
take thee in his keeping, noble brother!'
answered Ali Sarac, bowing with
courtesy
,
and laying his hand upon his heart.
The next moment he was dashing
after
his troop at full speed, followed by
his two attendants, one of whom led the
horse which had so well accommodated
Athir.
Alfonzo turned aside from the street
of the gate into another narrower and
obscure, bordered by low stone houses
with here and there an arch over-topped
by a palm, leading into the court-yard of
some secluded mansion. There were
but few persons in the streets, and these
standing about the door-ways. Now and
then two or three of the Moorish soldiers
were met lounging along, but they paid
no heed to the rider and his slave. The
twilight was already deepening into night,
and Alfonzo saw that it would be
necessary
for him to find the house of Senor
Velez to whom the hermit had
recommended
him.
`Dost thou know this street we are in,
Athir?' he asked of the young Moor who
walked at his horse's head.
`It is the street El Tarif, my lord! It
leads in the direction of the old palace of
Algezir!'
`I would seek the street which leads
past the Mosque of Omar, the fourth
door therefrom.'
`We shall have then to leave this one
and go to the left, my lord, and take
three turnings to bring us to the Mosque,
unless we turn back and approach it by
the street of the gate.'
`No, we will go this way, if it be the
safest.'
`There is less danger of meeting a
guard here. If you cross the great
square you will be challenged, now that
it is dark.'
`Then let us go on and at good speed,
Athir! I leave my guidance to thee,
for I am not familiar with the city.'
`I know it well, my lord. I lived here
in service with Algezir many months ere
I slew the Eunuch and fled to the
mountains
.
Vol. 2. Sig 4.
Dost thou see this high wall
which we are passing on our left, with
the trees over-topping it and loading the
air with the perfume of their flowers?'
`I see it, and the top of a noble edifice
within the garden.'
`This palace was the favorite residence
of the Caliph Musa, whose assassination
brought all the evils upon Cordova that
have since befallen it. It is still a fair
palace.'
`And what lofty tower is this on the
corner beyond, rising side by side with
that lofty palm, which seems to wish to
rival its height?'
`That is called the Vizier's tower.
From it the conqueror Taric received
his conquest and hung the severed
banner
of the prophet. It is now used as a
prison, my lord. Thou, seest that a
guard is pacing to and fro before it now.
Let us pass rapidly by!'
`Not so, Athir. It were safer to be
unconcerned,' answered Alfonzo.
As he rode past the Moorish sentinel
gazed at them fixedly, but remained
silent
and let them move on without
hinderance
.
They now came to the corner or
another street, broader and handsomer,
with stately edifices on either side and
shaded with rows of lime trees.
Minarets
pierced the sky above their heads,
and a vast dome lifted its huge bulk like
a mountain into the air.
`That is the Mosque of Omar,' said
Athir. `We will go down this narrow
street and come to it on the west side; by
this means we shall avoid the public
square in front of it, where, from the
sounds of trumpets and martial music
which we hear, we shall be likely to fall
in with the body guard of the Caliph.
Safe as your disguise is, my lord, you
cannot be too cautious.'
`I will be as careful, my brave and
faithful friend, as thou couldst wish to
have me; for more than my own life
and liberty hangs upon my safety. Ha,
here seems to be a broil in the street
before
us.'
`I hear the shouts. They are beating
a Christian slave!'
`Yes, I now hear their epithets of
`Christian dog' and `accursed Nazarine.'
And I hear the lashes, too, upon the
poor slaves back!' said Alfonzo, who
could scarcely restrain the impulse to
gallop forward and interpose to save the
victim of oppression whom he heard
pleading piteously in the name of the
Virgin for life! But he felt that he
owed as much to his own
self-preservation
as he did to humanity. `My poor
countryman!' he sighed.
`Let us pass another way, my lord,'
said Athir, who found that Alfonzo would
be tempted to expose himself in an effort
to rescue the Christian.
`No. Thou canst trust me, Athir. I
will not interpose. Heaven, in its grace,
soon vouchsafe to me the time when I
may!' he added fervently.
They now came up with the scene of
cruelty and suffering.
`What is this?' asken Athir of a man
who stood by with a trowel in his hand,
and in the garb of a mason.
`It is a Christian slave being
bastinadoed
,
as thou seest,' answered the Moor,
pointing to a man half naked, kneeling,
with his arms bound around a post, while
the soles of his feet were held up-turned
by a cord fastened to them, and grasped
by two Moslem boys. A man, with the
sleeves of his bernish rolled back to his
shoulder, was armed with a nine-lashed
whip, with which, at intervals of about a
quarter of a minute, he would inflict
severe
blows upon the exposed soles. At
every stroke of the cutting thongs the
man would utter a piercing shriek, which
would be mocked by the jeering Infidels
around. The sight made the bosom of
Alfonzo burn.
`What has he done?' demanded Athir
of the man with the trowel.
`He is the slave of the man who is
punishing himthat is enough, Allah be
praised,' answered the man; and he
turned
away and imitated with cruel
precision
another of the piercing cries which
the sufferer uttered.
`Save me, for Jesu's sake,' cried the
poor man.
`Call on Allah!' shouted the crowd.
`Yes, call on Allah, slave, and say
that God is God, and Mahomet is his
Prophet.'
`Never! Oh, Lord Jesu, save my
soul!' was the firm but agonizing
response
of the Christian.
It was with difficulty that Alfonzo
could recollect his own danger and
restrain
the impulse to rush forward to savo
him; for he was touched to the heart
with admiration by his noble firmness in
such an hour of suffering.
`Let us pass on, my lord,' said Athir.
`You can do nothing. If you speak in
his behalf, you will subject yourself to
suspicion.'
`I will go on, Athir. It would do no
good for me to speak. This is but one
in a thousand cases that occur each day.
To rescue him would be but as a drop
taken from the fountain of our sorrows,'
he said, riding forward, the crowd
making
way for him to pass.
`The master has powerover his slave,
and can do what he will, my lord. The
Caliph could not forbid the punishment
we have now witnessed. Here we are,
my lord, in the street which passes to the
morgue. We are at the lower end and
will have to pass up towards the morgue.
Thou didst say the fourth gate this side?'
`Yes, such were my directions.'
`Who is it thou wouldst see?'
`It is a man who, though a Christian,
still lives in Cordova free, though he had
to pay large sums for the privilege until
he became a Moslem.'
`A Moslem?'
`Thou shalt see him for thyself, Athir,'
answered Alfonzo, who felt that he ought
not to betray, even to Athir, that Senor
Velez was only outwardly a Mussulman,
being at heart a true Christian Spaniard.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE MOORISH SPANIARD.
The
street through which they now
were riding, was somewhat obscure in
appearance, and quite narrow. It
extended
from the rear of the city to the
grand central square, and passed close
by the mosque, the lofty dark walls of
which lined it for some distance.
It was now nearly dark. The stars
shone down between the branches of the
trees that grew within the gardens on
either side of the way, and the features
of the Moors that passed them were
undistinguishable
.
There were but few
persons visible, as after eight o'clock no
one was suffered to appear in the streets
without permission from the commander
of the city guard, and then only with a
lantern.
They now came near the beginning
of the mosque walls. Alfonzo looked
sharply for the house of the Signor
Velez
.
They at length came opposite a
low gate-way, placed in a wall not more
than twelve feet high, but which, by
counting the doors, answered to the
direction
given by the hermit, being the fourth
from the mosque, which towered in
majestic
and gloomy grandeur, far above
their heads.
`This is the place, my lord,' said
Athir, with confidence.
`Let us wait and ask this Moor who
comes along. Brother, dost thou know
if this be the dwelling of Velez, the
Moslem
Spaniard?'
`By the beard of Allah, brother, thou
art asking one who hath more need to
ask than answer,' responded the
well-known
voice of Ben Osmin. `I have
been up to the grand square, to hear the
music, and being of late a stranger in
Cordova, I have lost my way and know
not where to go. I was about to ask
thee, but thou art strangers also!'
`We are,' answered Alfonzo, who, as
well as the astonished Athir, had quickly
discovered who the speaker was; but
both commanded their surprise. To
Alfonzo
the meeting was a glad one; but
Athir trembled lest he should be
recognized
,
and reclaimed by the Moor, his
late master. So he stepped back in a
way to place the horse between them.
`What place do you seek, brother?'
asked Alfonzo, before whose mental
eyes, Genilla now appeared vividly.
`The street of Mecca, and the house
of Ben Habib, or as some call him
Yassef
,
the turban maker. It is there that
I lodge.'
`I am sorry I cannot inform thee?'
answered Alfonzo.
`Tell him to go back, and take the
first turn to the right, and the next to the
left. It is the street east of this,
running
the same way,' whispered Athir.
Alfonzo gave this information, and
received
the warm thanks of Ben Osmin,
who added, just as Alfonzo was trying to
conceive some mode of ascertaining the
safety of Genilla
`And I not only thank thee, but I have
a fair daughter who would thank thee
also, for this service, brother; for she
hath cried her eyes out by this time, lest
I should have fallen into evil hands.'
`Then thou hast a daughter, brother?'
`A daughter, whose eyes are brighter
than diamonds, and who is as good and
virtuous as she is fair. I have been but
three days in Cordova, and half the
gallants
in the suite of the new Caliph, have
rode by Ben Habib's door, prancing and
caracolling to show their bravery and
handsome appearance. But she is not
a maiden to be caught with glitter, or
good horsemanship.'
`Then she hath escaped all the snares
set for her beauty,' said Alfonzo, not a
little relieved by his last words, and in
his heart blessing the faithfulness of
Genilla. To hear from her, too, and to
know that she was well and in safety,
filled his bosom with joy. But he sighed
that Xariffa was not also as safe. The
news which Ben Osmin had thus
unconsciously
conveyed to him, relieved his
mind from a great weight of anxiety,
which had oppressed him, in relation to
her; for he knew that she had been in
Cordova through all the revolutions, and
was now there exposed to the lawless
pleasure of Abdelasis, who if he beheld
her, had only to command her to be
brought to his presence, who had but to
speak to make her his slave.
`I am glad to know, brother, thou art
so happy as to be blessed with such a
daughter,' he answered. `Dost thou
make a long stay in Cordova; if so, I
should like to know thee, and see this
beautiful maiden, though I am no wooer
like these young knights you speak of.'
`I shall be here for two days more. If
thou wouldst come and take coffee with
me, brother, I will gladly see thee. Thou
wilt find me at the sign of the scarlet
turban
,
in the street of Mecca, at the house
of Ben Habib. His abode is lowly, but
he is an honest man; and a good name
is better than gold. Allah be with thee,
brother, and in thy old age may men honor
thee!'
`May Allah keep thee a thousand
years, brother, and may thy children rise
up and call thee blessed!'
With these words, Alfonzo
dismounted
,
while Ben Osmin hurried away in
search of the dwelling of Ben Habib.
Afonzo congratulated himself at this
meeting; and he would have been
perfectly
happy if the thoughts of Xariffa
did not so forcibly press upon his mind.
Of her fate he was wholly ignorant.
That she had been brought into Cordova
and was in the seraglio of Abdelasis, he
sadly believed. But he had no time
now to dwell upon a subject so painful.
He resolved to see Senor Velez, and
be governed by his advice touching any
efforts to rescue her.
`Shall I knock at the gate, my lord?'
`Yes, but not noisely.'
`Who would enter here?' asked a
voice from within, a moment after Athir
had struck upon the door.
`A friend. Open in the name of
Allah
,
brother?' said Athir.
`I can admit no one after night,
without
a command from the Caliph or the
Captain of the city,' answered the
person
in a firm voice, but pleasing to the
ear.
`We shall not get in, my master!'
responded
Athir in a tone of
disappointment
.
`Doubtless there are robbers
about, and he mistakes us for such!'
`Hold the bridle, Athir. I will speak
to him,' answered Alfonzo, approaching
the gate, which was cast into deep
shadow
by the projecting Moorish arch over
it. `Art thou not the Senor Velez?' he
asked, in Spanish.
`Yes,' responded the Spaniard, in a
tone evidently of surprise at being
addressed
in his own tongue, by men in
Moorish costume; for he could see,
through a little window at the side gate,
the figures of his visitors.
`I am a friend to thee. I am sent by
one who gave me this little token, which
I place in thy hands. If it satisfies thee,
admit me, my horse and servant; for
there is a party of cavalry coming down
the street, and I would rather be under
cover when they came by.'
With these words, Alfonzo drew from
his bosom the little silver cross which the
hermit had given him, and handed it to
the Senor Velez through the little
opening
by the post of the gate.
There was a moment's suspense while
the Spaniard took the cross to a light
to examine it, and the removal of the
bars of the gate with a clanking of heavy
chains was heard by them, and the door
slowly swung open to admit them.
`Welcome, Senor, and quickly, thou
and thy steed. It is not safe to keep
one's gate open long, in such times as
these, after dark. Lead the horse through
into the court, slave. Thy hand, Senor.
Welcome to my home. I know, Moor
as thy garb would make thee to be, that
thou art a Spaniard, and a friend to the
abbot Godfrey. Who thou art, thou wilt,
doubtless, by and by, inform me!'
With these words, he drew him into
the court, and Athir followed, leading
the horse, whom he conducted to the
stalls on the opposite side of the walled
court-yard, which Senor Velez pointed
out to him. He then secured the gate,
and by a flight of steps led Alfonzo into
a handsome room, at the extremity of
which was a raised floor, carpeted and
surrounded with divans, in Moorish style
of furnishing houses. The Spaniard
himself was habited as a Moslem, and
with his mixed white and black beard,
his noble forehead and fine eyes, his lofty
figure and air of quiet dignity, he might
have been taken for a Sultan.
He wore a white muslin turban,
clasped
by a diamond in front; a long
crimson
sash bound together at his waist the
folds of his white bermish. His vest,
which was visible through the opening in
his robe, was of yellow, worked with gold.
He wore red morocco slippers, turned up
in a half-moon at the toes, and gilded
with a border of flowers.
His appearance, with that of the
apartment
,
was strictly Moorish. For a
moment
Alfonzo believed that he was in the
dwelling of a Mussulman, rather than that
of a native Spaniard, who still held to the
faith of the cross.
The Senor Velez led his guest to the
dais, or raised floor, at the extremity of
the apartment, and seated him upon a
divan, above which was suspended a
silver
lamp filled with burning olive oil, that
shed a soft clear radiance around.
`Thou hast seen the Abbot Godfrey,
lately,' said the host, clasping together
his hands as he spoke, a signal for the
appearance
of a Nubian slave in a pink
turban
and flowing white muslin trowers.
`Elec, coffee.'
The slave bowed profoundly and
retired
.
`I saw the holy father at noon-tide.'
`So lately. He then reached the
mountains safely. I rejoice at this.
Pardon
my close scrutiny, Senor, but I
would like to know why thou art here,
and in this guise? and why this silver
cross was given to thee for me? I
expected
it to have been brought by some
one else than such as thou seemest to be?
`Who did you expect would bring it,
Senor?'
`I may not say. Reveal thyself and
there shall be confidence between us.'
`I am the pupil of father Godfrey
This he bade me say to you.'
`His pupil! He was a peasant youth,'
said the Spaniard with surprise, gazing
upon the noble aspect and commanding
air of the young man before him.
`So am I, Senor. I am Alfonzo.'
`Thou the Destroyer?'
`The Moors have called me so, Senor.'
`Then, welcome: thrice welcome.
Forgive my coldness and suspicion, noble
Alfonzo. Do I indeed behold thee of
whom I have heard so much!' he cried,
surveying him with emotion and
admiration
.
`Let me embrace thee! I dared
not hope so much when the abbot bade
me be ready to see thee beneath my
roof ere many days passed! Welcome
to my house and to my heart.'
Alfonzo was not a little gratified to
meet with such a reception in the very
heart of the city of his foes.
`I feel happy, noble Velez,' he said,
on beholding one whom Spain has
honored
,
and who sat at the right hand of two
of her princes. But I am sorry that I find
thee an exile under the very shadow of
the palace of the Spanish Kings, and
doomed to wear the turban of the
conqueror
to purchase life.'
`I wear it not to buy my life, Alfonzo,
but to watch my foes, the enemies of
Spain and of God.'
`I know it, noble Senor. The holy
hermit hath unfolded to me all this. He
hath sent me to thee to learn how Spain
stands in the scale with her opponent.'
`I am glad to see thee, Alfonzo. I am
glad to hold converse with one man who
feels for, and loves Spain, and seeks her
glory again. The abbot hath told me
how thou lovest thy country. He hath
old me how thou mournest over her
downfall, and art ready to draw the sword
of liberty to redeem her.'
`He hath told thee truly, Senor. But
what can I do? Thou knowest that I am
but a peasant.'
`Thou art more! Thou hast, by thy
courage and example raised and led to
vicry
to over banditti a handfull of thy
mountaineers
.
A man who can do this, and
who will do this, can make that handfull
of men a thousand, and that thousand ten
thousand.'
`Would to God, Senor, thy words
were prophetic!' exclaimed Alfonzo.
`But I feel my weakness. I am ready
to do all than man can do for my
bleeding
,
enslaved country; but there are
many nobles, many of the ranks far above
me, who would mock my pretensions,
and scorn to be led by a herdsman.'
`Then let them find a leader among
themselves, if they can. They will find
no one;they are all cowards, made so
by bondage. Mark me, Alfonzo: they
will hail with joy the man who lifts the
Standard of the Cross again in the land,
and unsheathes his sword to defend it.
The Abbot Godfrey and I have
discoursed
this matter well. We have talked of
you and your influence among the hardy
mountaineers. He tells me that they all
love you, and that you have only to stand
up and say that Spain shall be freeyour
arm will free her. It is an examplea
leader that men want.'
`Senor, I have given myself to this
work; I am conscious of the difflculties;
I may failI may perish; but I shall do
all that I can do for my poor country. I
will act as if I had authority: for I see
no other man who will stand in my place
and lift the standard of liberty. I will do
it, and trust in God, who caused David
with a sling to overthrow Goliah, and
give victory to Israel.'
`That is the true spirit, my brave son,'
said the Spaniard, as the Nubian
re-entered
and served coffee to them, in silver
cups of exquisite workmanship.
CHAPTER XV.
THE YOUTHFUL CHIEF.
The
coffee which the slave served up
was accompanied by dried fruits and
other refreshments, to which was added
the rich wine of Xeres, nectar delicious
enough to tempt the Moslem to break the
laws of his Prophet. While Alfonzo was
engaged in doing justice to the hospitable
repast set before him after his fatigues of
the day, Athir entered, and standing
silently
,
waited to be noticed by his
master
,
as if he were indeed Alfonso's slave.
The keen glance of the Spaniard rested
on him steadfastly for a moment, and
then turning quickly to his guest, he said
with surprise, not untinged with
something
like rising suspicion,
`Thy servant is a Moor! There is no
deception in that eye and brow. He is
a Moorhow is this?'
`He
is
a Moor, Senor,' answered
Alfonzo
;
`but he can be trusted. He is
faithful to me, and will be to thee.'
`I never yet knew one I could trust,'
answered Velez. `How! Is he thy
slave? I have never yet known a Moor
the slave of a Christian.'
`I will tell thee about it, Senor,'
answered
Alfonzo; and he then proceeded
to relate to him the facts touching his
history, which have already been
repeated
to the reader. When he had done,
the Spanish noble called to Athir, and
gave him his hand.
`Young man, I honor thy fidelity! I
will also trust thee, if Alfonzo hath done
so. Thou mayest be of service to us.
Elec,' he added, after clapping his hands
and bringing in the Nubian slave, `see
that thou givest refreshment to this youth,
and that he has a mat spread down in the
room of the fountain, where thou wilt
also prepare a couch for his master.
See, too, that his horse wants nothing.'
The Nubian clasped his hands above
his head, and bowed to the ground in
token of obedience, and departed,
followed
by Athir.
`Now, my brave friend,' said the
Spanish noble, turning to his guest, `let
us talk over the wrongs of Spain, and
let us see what can be done to redress
them. I converse with thee with full
confidence
.
I know thy courage and
influence
well with the mountaineers; and
when news reached me three years ago
that a young mountaineer had armed
and led on his neighbours, and driven
the banditti from the Sierras, I blessed
God that there was yet one stout arm
and brave heart left in Spain, though it
were but a mountain youth's. And when
a few month's later the rumor came that
this same youth had stormed a castle,
and driven El Zegris forth a fugitive, I
again blessed God, and began to believe
that there were yet good men left in
Spain, who feared not the Moor. When
more recently came the intelligence that
El Zegris had again been attacked and
overthrown by thee, his person made
captive, and his right hand struck off by
thy scymetar, I said in my heart
`If Spain shall ever call for a
champion
,
that youth, whose prowess is in all
men's mouths, is the man to lead her to
victory. But then I knew no more than
this, that thou werest a humble herdsman.
Since, the holy Abbot Godfrey, hath
given me the outline of thy history, and
his opinion did but confirm my own, that
thou shouldst one day be the mover of a
revolt agaiust our masters. He said that
you were a lover of your country, and
mourned her wrongs, but that you were
doubtful of your influence, and too
modest
to know its wide extent. He felt
sure, however, that you would one day
rouse up, and stand in your native power,
and call on your countrymen to arm for
God and Spain. To this end, he said,
he had been watching over your mind
and heart, and so training thee to be one
day the saviour of thy country.'
`What I am, I owe to my excellent
friend,' answered Alfonzo, who had sat
quietly under the high language of
eulogium
,
that flowed from the lips of Senor
Velez. `What he has made me, that
my country shall have the benefit of.
But, Senor, I never looked to so wide a
feld of action as opens so unexpectedly
before me, and which I seem to be
irresistibly
thrust upon. I looked only to be
the leader of a small band of my fellow
herdsmen, to hold the Sierras free from
step of the Moslem, whether soldier or
bandit. Beyond this, I dare not aspire,
though my heart has secretly burned at
the thought, that I should like to be the
saviour of my country. I have wished
that my voice might rouse all the men in
Spain, as it hath stirred the breasts of
my fellow peasants when I have called
upon them to rally around me, to drive
the robber from his fastnesses, or attack
a horde of wolves in their lair.'
`Do not shrink. Heaven will gird thee
with strength. We want a man whom
Spain has heard of, and the Moors too!
`I shall not shrink. I have a motive
that urges me onward side by side with
the desire I have to see Spain free. It
is revenge for my sister's wrongs.
Within
the last twelve hours, Senor Velez,
my only sister, loved and lovely beyond
compare, has been stolen by the troops
of Abdelasis from her pure home, and
carried away to his harem.'
`Is this so? Alas, I pity thee. Thou
hast reason to take arms, young man.
But this is no new thing that it should be
made a reason.'
`Nobut to me it is. I should have
moved ere this to avenge others. But I
lingered ignobly, timid and hesitatingly,
till the blow came home to me. Then I
became earnest. Then, and only till
then, I am ashamed to acknowledge, did
I resolve that I would not rest till I had
roused a spirit of resistance in the length
and breadth of the land!'
`This decision must have filled the
holy Abbot's heart with joy; for the weal
of Christian Spain is the theme of his
daily prayer. For this he only lived.'
`His joy I cannot describe! So often
had he talked to me of the glory that
should fall upon him who should, whether
prince or peasant, lead Spain against the
Moslem once more; so often had he
implored
me to take a bold stand, humble
as I was, for God and liberty; so often
had he told me that I owed to Spain what
influence I procured over my friends
about me; that when I told him I had at
length got awake and had resolved to
kindle the flames of revolt, and I could
almost have believed that he had been
instrumental in the abduction of my
sister
,
that my heart might thereby be
roused; for it seems it wanted this to
move me, Senor,' he added, bitterly
smiling.
`I can imagine his joy. My own heart
is young again when I look upon thy
noble
form and think that Christian Spain, in
Alfonzo the Destroyer has once more a
Champion!'
`But how will Spain receive me,
Senor
?'
`With open arms!'
`I do not doubt but that among the
Sierras I shall be able to assemble at
least two thousand brave men. Not that
I am known to one third of this number,
but those I do know are acquainted with
others, and will influence them. This
day I was one of an assembly of fifty in
the cork forest of Debal; fifty brave
men, including my father, Gaspar. Hast
thou heard of him?'
`I knew him, when he was one of the
bravest nobles in Spain. He has had a
hard fate. From father Godfrey I have
from time to time heard of him and of
his great prowess. As Gaspar, the
Wolf-Slayer
,
his name is celebrated even
among the Moors.'
`When didst thou see the Abbot last?'
`He left here this morning, disguised
as a Hadji, and when he parted from me
he promised me that ere many days he
should send to me the Deliverer of
Spain. `And,' he added, `whomsoever
comes to thee bringing this cross,
receive
him as a friend. It may possibly
be my Alfonzo, if not some other who will
give the tidings of things in the Sierras!'
These were the Abbot's words to me;
and little did I expect to embrace thee
so soon!'
`Nor wouldst thou have seen me
to-night
,
but for the outrage put upon me in
taking my beloved sister away by force.
I could almost be persuaded to believe
that father Godfrey had an agency in
sending the troop to capture her; for he
knew I needed this to move me to my
duty!'
`Art thou in earnest in this suspicon?'
`God forbid. I did but speak of the
coincidence between the fact and the
result
.
He loves me, and is too good for
this, even though he thought he could
free Spain thereby.'
`If ever father loved a son, the Abbot
loves thee. I know not what there is that
hath, for years, as I know, bound him to
thee, beyond thy good qualities and
noble
countenance, which no man would
look upon without feeling an interest in
thee. But for what didst thou get these
fifty brave mountaineers together in the
forest?'
`They assembled at the cry that the
Moors had poured upon our hamlet and
borne away the Star of the Sierras, as
they loved to call Xariffa. But pursuit
was in vain. I then swore solemnly
before
my maker that I would never rest
till I had rescued her, or driven the
Spoiler
out of Spain, if men would arm and
follow me!'
`Brave words. St. Diego be thanked!
This sounds like steel ringing on steel.
What said they?'
`They received my words with
acclamations
.
It inspired me. I saw in their
readiness the spirit of all others. The
Abbot came suddenly upon us, and when
he knew what had been determined on,
tears of joy came into his eyes. He would
have embraced my knees. He clasped
me to his heart, saying,
`For this hour have I watched over
theefor this hour have I lived!'
`Thou must have felt rewarded
already
at witnessing the happiness he felt.'
`I was, Senor. But you will be
surprised
to know that he made me kneel,
and did there in a most solemn manner
consecrate me by prayer and anointing
with holy oil, to the service of my
country
.
I would have resisted, but he held
me down; and I submitted, though I
trembled, at the awful ceremony;for
I did not feel equal to what men seemed
to call upon me to perform.'
`I tell thee, son, God will give thee
strength. Thou art raised up his servant
and Captain; of this be assured, and go
forward with courage to thy duty. But
this is singular indeed!kings only are
anointed; and what is more
extraordinary
,
the Abbot himself anointed
Amalaric
,
our last Christian Gothic king, whom
Taric the conqueror slew, with the royal
Princes of his house.'
`Were but one of those young Princes
alive now, Senor, and proclaiming
himself
such, should raise the standard of the
cross, all Spain would rise as one man to
rally around him. But for me, I have no
more than the wrongs of Spain, the
oppression
of the Moor, to appeal to.'
`And what more do you ask? all men
in Spain will respond to the appeal.'
`I will point heavenward to God, and
tell them that He is their Prince and
Kingthat I am but a servant in his
hand!'
`Thou art too modestbut I like it in
thee. It shows me that thou art the
person
to be trusted. Fifty men, saidst
thou? What became of them?'
`I sent them two by two up the
valleys
,
and over the Sierras, to penetrate
every where a Christian dwelt and
walked, and call on them to up and arm
for their country, and on the eve of St.
James be found at the Rock of St. Paul.'
`This is indeed newsgreat news!
And did you see them depart?'
`Filled with zeal. By this time two
thousand men have been told the tale,
that on the eve of St. James the standard
of the cross will be raised on the sacred
Rock over against Cordova.'
`Heaven prosper the cause! Thou
hast began well; the Sierras will soon
be alive! But what can be done here?
for I know thou art in Cordova to ask that
very question,'
`I have come to see if there are any
left here who remember Spain under its
Christian King, and who in their bondage
sigh again for those days to return. I
have left Gaspar to act as my lieutenant
till I return. The news of the revolt will
reach only Christian ears till the hour to
strike arrives.'
`If fifty thousand Christians were
entrusted
with the secret, not one Moor
could get possession of it. Now we will
see what can be done here. In the
valleys
and mountains there are one
hundred
thousand Spaniards. If this news
flies fast, and secretly as fast, it will be
easy to bring to your standard twenty
thousand men by the eve of St. Diego.'
`Not
my
standard, Senor, but Christ's,'
answered Alfonzo, with his characteristic
modesty.
`I see thou art well-fitted for the place
that Heaven hath put thee in,' said the
Spaniard impressively. `Thou wilt
become
a popular leader. I will give thee
twenty thousand men from the valleys
and the hills, noble chief: but in
Cordova
I know not how manybut we will
soon see.'
CHAPTER XVI.
THE TWO CONSPIRATORS.
The
Spaniard now produced a roll of
parchment, and unfolding it, laid it upon
the divan between them, and said, as he ran
his finger over the columns of names and
trades and conditions:
`Here is a register which I have kept,
so far as I could make it accurate of the
number of Spanish Christians in Cordova.
The aggregate at which I see your eye
glances, makes them sixty-six thousand,
old and young, male and female.'
`It is a larger number than I had
supposed
,'
answered Alfonzo.
`Yes, our people seem to live
wonderfully
long under this servitude. Here
you see are about sixteen thousand
ablebodied
men, capable of bearing arms, in
these sixty-six thousand; the balance
being old, or women and children. Of
these sixteen thousand, many of them
are of the best blood of Spainand now
they are hewers of wood and drawers of
water to the Moor. There is not an
Infidel
in Cordova, however low his degree
or mean his trade, who has not one or
more of these, our Christian brethren, as
slaves. You of the mountains have fared
better and kept your freedom!'
`But it will not be much longer, I
hear, if we are supine. I allude, Senor,
to the decree of Abdelasis!'
`It is a base and cruel one. It is
worthy of himself. When I read it
yesterday
,
I then said, `In this decree,
Caliph
,
unless Spain be utterly lost, you have
signed the downfall of Moslem power in
the land!'
`I believe so,' answered Alfonzo, with
warmth. `There is not fifty men in Spain
base enough to come into Cordova and
thus register their names, knowing that
they are to be afterwards compelled to
become Moslem's.'
`I trust there are not!'
`It was this decree which I heard of,
even before I knew of my sister's loss,
which kindled the flames of liberty in my
bosom. The outrage done me by
stealing
her away was setting the last torch.
I have hopes that the noise of the decree
will do more for the causedo more to
bring men to their duty than any
influence
I can exert. Still a rallying point is
needed; and till Heaven gives my
country
a better leader, I am willing to stand
up first and strike for Spain and the
Cross!'
`The decree of Abdelasis will go
before
your fifty messengers, and prepare
the way for them. Gladly they will
listen to tidings that will point them to a
chieftain who dares defy Abdelasis, and
abide the issue, trusting to God and his
cause!'
`Your words give me more confidence
in myself, noble Velez. How many of
these sixteen thousand men will listen to
these tidings here in Cordova? Can
access
be got to their ears? Can they be
communicated with, without excting
before
the time the suspicions of their
masters
?'
`Yes. I have influence with one
hundred
men here, of our nation; slaves they
are, indeed, but they are well
treated
and have much leisure; some of them
even acting as Secretaries to officers of
the State, at least to such as were
officers
under the Emirs. These men love
Spain as I do. They mourn over her
degradation and the stain upon the true
cross, cast by the shadow of the
Crescent
.
They look, as I have looked, for
a Deliverer to arise in the land. Your
name they have heard, and repeated it
to me. These men know each one or
more others whom they talk with upon
the wrongs of their land; and these
associate
with others.
`In a word, the whole sixteen thousand
are linked together in degrees, like those
I have mentioned. An idea
communicated
to one, reaches every individual,
however lowly he may lie in his bonds.
One word of hope spoken this night by
me to four or five friends, ere morning,
would have stirred and warmed a thousand
hearts; and in twenty-four hours, not a
Christian slave in Cardova would be
ignorant
of it.'
`This is all that could be desired for
our cause. I did not know before that
the slaves of our people here in
Cordova
,
thus kept alive a love of Spain.
They have, most of them, seemed
sullenly
indifferent, or else cowardly
contented
in their servitude!'
`And why should you look for
outward
signs of freedom among men, who
live in bondsover whose heads hangs
the scymetar of the Caliph, or the thonged
lash of his master. Who are watched;
who are without arms; who have no
King nor leader to look up to, to keep
alive hopewho are treated as the dogs
of the kennel!'
`What a picture of degradation. Poor
Spain! alas, for my degraded
countrymen
!'
`It is your sacred duty, Alfonzo, to
strike a blow in their behalf! They will
hear your name with joy! Alfonzo, our
deliverer, will flow like honey from their
lips, and they will feel their hearts once
more throb with hope. The
grey-headed
man will lift up his bowed form, and
recall again the glories of the past, and
hope to behold them once more restored.
The youthful will look forward to see,
what they have not yet seen, Spain once
more a Christian kingdom. Mothers and
maidens will bless thee, and thou wilt
have that calm, deep joy in thy bosom,
which will flow from the happiness, of
which you have been the instrument.'
`But much is to be done, Senor.
There are in Cordova'
`Thirty thousand Moorish citizens and
eighteen thousand Moorish soldiers,
exclusive
of the Zenetan cavalry, one
thousand strong, and which now
compose
the body-guard of the new Caliph,
as they have done of the Emir's before
him. They are mercenaries, and are
paid for their services, and serve him who
pays them best.'
`There may be then, full twenty five
thuusand men to encounter, soldiers and
citizens,' said Alfonzo. `To take
Cordova
will require thirty thousand.'
`This number, mark my words, will
be raised easily; and if the revolt goes
on secretly, so that Abdelasis knows not
of the coming storm till it bursts upon
him, less than this number will do. But
if he should hear of it, he will so prepare
for it, that we may need fifty thousand
men to take the city, and maintain the
ports in the valley.'
`The undertaking is a great one,
Senor
,
but I trust we shall have the aid of
Heaven, and I feel assured, that if other
Christian nations see us make an effort
to expel the Moor, we shall have the aid
of their swords.'
`I foresee this, Alfonzo. Now I think
we understand each other, and know our
duties in the task before us. Mine is to
call on the influential Christians in the
city, and make known to them our
contemplated
movement. I will confide the
secret to a few confidential men, who
will spread it from lip to ear, till all who
hate the Moors in Cordova, shall know
that a Deliverer is raised up in Cordova,
and they will be ready to act with us as
one man!'
`When will you see these friends?'
asked Alfonzo, rising.
`At once. I will go forth at once
with Elic to bear a lantern before me,
and visit a few of the principal persons
I have in my mind. I shall find them
easily, and can see them without
suspicion
,
as among the Moors I am taken
for a Moor; and I have business with
their masters almost daily in the way of
my traffic, for I am a dealer in silks, as
you shall see in the marning, when I shall
show you my goods, Will you remain
here, my chief?'
`Call me Alfonzo, Senor.'
`Nay, thou art our chief, and must
submit to be addressed as such. I feel
that God has given the deliverance of
Spain, and the restoration of the cross to
thee to perform. To thy power and
guidance I bow, and so will all men who
hear thy name. It is now eight o'clock.
I shall return by ten, and you can repose
here on this divan, for you must needs
be weary.'
Thus speaking, Senor Velez threw on
a long brown cloak which he wore abroad,
and girding it at the waist by a sash, he
covered his head with a scarlet turban of
many voluminous folds, and took a staff
in his hand.
`Elec,' he said to the Nubian, who
entered at his call, take your lantern and
go forth with me.'
The slave, after a moment's absence,
returned with a large, richly painted
lantern
,
and preceding his master undid the
gate, and waited for him to pass.
`I shall return in two hours, I trust, able
to say to thee, Alfonzo, that the ball has
been set in motion, which shall not cease
to roll till it has thrown down Mosque and
minaret. You will not venture forth till
I return, for it would peril your life
unnecessarily
.'
`I will await you here, Senor, though
I feel little disposed to repose,' answered
the young chief. `Say to these Christian
bondmen that they must make no
movement
,
but only wait and stand prepared
to strike when they hear the war cry of
Spain breaking on their ears on the eve
of San Diego.'
The rich Spanish merchant then
folded
his cloak about him, and departed up
the street, giving Alfonzo particular
directions
to secure the gate and to admit
no one. Alfonzo followed, with his eye,
the dark forms, with their flickering
lantern
,
till they disappeared up the street,
and then turned to secure the gate. Athir
was at his shoulder.
`My lord,' said the youth, `I will bar
the gate. But I expected you would go
forth to see what hath become of Xariffa.'
`That, Athir, is a mission I shall give
to thee,' he said, smiling.
`To me?' cried the youth with
sparkling
eyes.
`Yes, to you, Athir. I want you to go
and ascertain where she is. You will
proceed at once to the palace of
Abdelasis
,
and I will leave to your address and
courage to get the intelligence I desire.
It will be easier for you, being a Moor,
than for me, and besides, I am known to
Abdelasis, and I should not wish to be
discovered.'
`I will go, my lord. I know I can
hear something from her if she is at the
palace. I would disguise myself as a
page and go boldly into the palace if I
had the dress.'
`If you had gold could you purchase
such a costume? Are not the bazaars
closed?'
`Not till nine o'clock, my lord.'
`Then here are five pieces which the
holy father put into my hand, saying I
should want money in Cordova, and I
find he spoke truly.'
`I can get all I want for two of the gold
pieces, my lord. I know well where the
bazaar is, in which I used to purchase
my suits when I was a page. I will go
there; and, habited as a page of the
palace
,
I will discover if Xariffa is in the
power of Abdelasis; and I will return ere
breakfast to-morrow, perhaps earlier, and
let you know what I hear.'
`You can inquire of those about, what
Christian maiden it was that a party of
Zenetan horse captured to-day, and if
she were sold. This question will open
a way to my poor sister's discovery.'
`Trust to me, my lord! I will proceed
to my task with courage and love for
thee!' answered the youth.
Alfonzo grasped him by the hand,
warmly, and then set him forth.
`Thou must have a lantern?'
`No. I will glide along by the shad
ows. Thou shalt soon hear of thy
sister's
fate, my lord!'
Thus speaking, he glided away up the
street in the direction taken by Signor
Velez and his Nubian slave; and was
soon lost in the darkness that enveloped
the street.
`Now,' said Alfonzo as he lingered at
the open gate, `now have I done all that
is in my power to do in behalf of my
sister
.
Once let me know her fate and I
shall know how to act in her behalf.
That she is in the power of Abdelases, I
have now no doubt: for the party was
composed of the Zeretan horse, who,
says Signor Velez, are taken into the
Caliph's service. I begin to fear he may
have seen my sister, and been inspired
with passion for her, and so has done this
deed! But I shall learn when the
faithful
Athir returns!'
CHAPTER XVII.
THE SERENADER.
Alfonzo had not been long alone after
the departure of Athir when he began to
experience restless desire to see Genilla,
and ascertain if she were in safety.
`Duty and religion,' he said within
himself, `would teach me to forget her
now that I have given myself to the
overthrow of her people's power and the
upraising of the cross where the crescent
now stands! But my heart is more
powerful
with its arguments than my head.
I must see! I cannot cease loving her.
I hope yet to make her a christian!'
He was pacing up and down the paved
court within the house of Signor Velez
as he thus mused. It was overhung with
trees on two sides that grew in a garden,
to which a gate in the wall led. The
moon was just rising and silvering the
tops of the palms and shedding its lustre
upon the minarets. The
dwee-loo
or
Andalusian
nightingale was singing in the
branches of an orange tree above his
head, and the air was laden with
fragrance
.
He examined the little gate
which was set in the wall and found that
by drawing a bolt on the innerside it
came open. He passed through it and
found himself in a spacious garden of
shady walks, fountains and terraces. It
was a scene of wonderful beauty to be
thus hidden in the heart of the city. In
the centre of the garden, were two lofty
palms that waved their tall capitals in the
soft winds and cast an ever moving shade
upon the sward at his feet.
He was charmed with the loveliness
and quiet of the place. He rambled on,
and passing a marble fountain, ascended
a flight of steps, which led him to a
higher
terrace of the garden. He saw in the
distance the walls of a villa, on the
remote
extremity of the garden
overlooking
it. He moved slowly in the direction
of it, and as he came in sight of a lattice
he thought he heard voices. He drew
his scymetar, and threw back the folds
of his bernish, so as to free his right arm,
and taking off his turban, he cautiously
went forward. But instead of an enemy
or foes seeking to attack him, he saw,
as he passed round the trunk of a large
cypress, with his sword in his grasp,
ready to defend himself should he come
suddenly upon foes,leaning in an easy
attitude against a palm-tree, a man
playing
upon a guitar, and singing as he
played
with a fine rich voice.
He could not be deceived!the voice
was that of Abdelasis; and as the
moonlight
fell full upon his figure, revealing
his features, he clearly recognised the
Caliph.
He stood transfixed at the discovery;
his first impulse was to rush forward and
attack him upon the spot, and if possible
take him prisoner. But he reflected that
aid might be nighthat he knew not
where he was, having wandered through
the gardens some distance from the
merchant's
house, and that his retreat might
be cut off. Besides, Abdelasisthough
he deserved punishment for his
treachery
to himmight be innocent of the
abduction or of the fate of Xariffa.
He was not a little surprised to meet
the Caliph in these gardens, and
especially
thus sentimentally playing the lover.
He bent his eyes keenly to see if he
could discern any one at the lattice; but
all was quiet there, and no sign even of
a fair hand upon the casement.
He remained for a few moments,
concealed
by the trunk of the cypress from
the view of Abdelasis, whose face was
upturned to the lattice. He could not
catch but here and there a word of what
he sang, but it was enough to show him
that it was a song of love.
At length he ceased, and looked up to
the lattice intently, and then waved his
guitar towards it, saying
`Cruel fair one! He who woos thee
might command thee. It is I, not thou,
who am bound a prisoner;my heart is
in chains, and I sigh in bondage! Wilt
thou not appear, lady?'
There was no reply; the lattice
betrayed
no presence; and the Prince
slowly moved away, stealthily followed
by Alfonzo. The latter pressed rapidly
forward, but suddenly drew back on
seeing
four Moorish soldiers standing in the
path waiting for the Caliph, who joined
them and disappeared in a dark alcove
of foliage that overhung the wall.
Alfonzo
went onward, and coming to the
place, found that a gate had let them
forth; but whether into a street or
another
garden adjoining he could not tell,
as the wall was so high.
`This is a wilderness of gardens,' said
he, as he looked about him. `Can it be
possible I am in the royal gardens of the
palace? How singular that I should
have beheld Abdelasis, and in such an
occupation! He may well say, he who
wooes may command. And what
maiden
is it who dares dispute his power
and scorn his love? Who can it be who
has so won his heart that he dare not
command, but is compelled to sue; and
even puts up with silence and
indifference
?
Whoever she is who rules the
proud Prince thus by love, rules Spain!
I will return and watch this lattice well;
it may be that I may see her. Were it
not that he sued so humbly for her
favor
,
I should believe that it was Xariffa.
I will at least endeavor to ascertain
who it is. It is well that I did not
attack
the Caliph as my first impulse
prompted me to do. I should have been
overpowered or slain; and I have given
my life to Spain not to be cast away in a
broil even with Abdelasis for my
antagonist
.
If I had slain him now Spain
would have been no less in bondage.
Others would have risen, and anarchy
and discord would have filled Cordova.
It is better for our conspiracy that the
Moslem power be consolidate and united
under him that we may know where to
strike, and know that when we strike we
strike off the head. Let Abdelasis live
till we are ready to meet and overthrow
him with all who belong to him.'
He now came in front of the lattice
and looked up with caution. There was
no one visible. He was in shadow and
yet commanded a full and near view of
the casement. He saw that it had been
opened since the Caliph left, for it was
now ajar, and when he was before it, it
was closely shut. This fact as well as
the earnest manner of the Prince in his
moonlight serenade led him to feel
confident
that some one was there. He
resolved
to ascertain whether it were
Xariffa or not by singing a few notes of
a Spanish ballad that she well knew and
which they had often sung together.
He began at first in a low tone and
then raising his voice till it fully reached
the casement he sang one verse of the
ballad, his eye, from his covert, full upon
the lattice.
It was suddenly thrown opena white
arm glowed in the moonlight and Xariffa
looked eagerly forth. The heart of
Alfonzo
bounded with joy. He lifted up
his heart in gratitude to God that he had
found his lost sister. But he did not at
once show himself. He was
apprehensive
:
he might have attracted attention
by his singing from some other ears than
hers. He therefore remained silent and
immoveable watching her, his heart
throbbing with joy. She looked eagerly
out and bending far forward listened.
She closely surveyed the ground beneath
the lofty casement, and seemed loth to
give up the search. He could see that
her face was pale and anxious. He
knew that she was a prisoner; but why
Abdelasis should thus humbly woo
amazed him. But he had not been
cognizant
of their former interview in the
cabin. He was ignorant of the sudden
passion which his guest had entertained
for his sister, and how completely
enthralled
by her charms was his haughty
spirit.
Finding all was still in the garden,
Alfonzo thought he could safely make
himself known, and advancing from the
shadow of the wall he suddenly
appeared
before her, forgetting his Moorish
costume, supposing she would instantly
recognise him as he had done her.
But when seeing him she stepped back
from the casement with a slight
exclamation
.
He then removed his turban
and called to her:
`Xariffa! Sister! It is I!'
Instantly the maiden reappeared at
the window, and uttered an exclamation
of delight as she gazed down upon the
noble brow of her brother on which the
moonlight broadly lay. `Oh, Alfonzo,
God bless you for seeking me out! But
fly at once! You cannot save me. You
will perish! You know not in whose
power I am.'
`I know well, Xariffa. I saw the
Caliph leave this place. You are in his
power. I will save you.
`You can do nothing. This window
is too lofty for me to descend to you,
and if you should reach the casement
you would only rush upon death. This
palace is closely guarded. I am a
prisoner
!
and I would not have you share
my fate! Fly! Think not of me but
fly!'
`I am secure in my disguise, Xariffa.
I have found you and I will not go away
and have you in the hands of Abdelasis.
Was it not by his order you were taken
captive?'
`Yes. I was brought to the city and
to this tower, where he came to see me;
but I rejected his suit with scorn?'
`And yet he loves thee! Did he see
thee, Xariffa?' asked Alfonzo earnestly,
coming still nearer to the window, `did
he see you at the hamlet?'
`Alas! he did. He came to my room
unexpectedly. He talked long with me.
He offered me his heart, but I refused to
listen to him. He left me, but in anger.
I should have told this to you, and you
would have guarded me more securely.
I owe my present situation to my silence.'
`It cannot now be helped, sister! I
know that it was not your fault. But the
Prince loves you! You have powerover
him that no one in Spain possesses. He
will be goaded to madness by your
indifference
,
and destroy you, a sacrifice to
his pride and passion. I will aid you to
escape. Can you throw me a cord?'
`There is none. I cannot escape,
save by the gates, and these are guarded
by armed men. I do not fear the Prince.
If he persists, I have a dagger, and will
die, ere I become his slave!'
`Nay, Xariffa, I am glad to see thee
show thyself so resolute. But this must
not be. Thou must be rescued. Who
else hast thou in the palace with thee?'
`There are slaves to do my bidding.
The apartments are sumptuous. I am
surrounded with every luxury.
Abdelasis
has twice been here and knelt at
my feet. He said he disdained to make
me a slave by his power, he sued for the
free gift of my heart. To-night he has
sought to win me with songs of love. He
is very kind!'
`Couldst thou love him, Xariffa?'
asked
Alfonzo, struck with her last words,
and beginning to suspect that her heart
might be secretly interested and moved
by his flattering homage and profound
attentions
.
`Love a moslem?' she repeated with
amazement.
`Suppose he were a christian, sister?'
`Then I could, indeed love him! He
is very noble and tender in his speech,
and has every grace to win a maiden's
love! But I do not forget that he is an
unbeliever!'
`And thou wilt not forget even this,
long, my sister, I see,' answered
Alfonzo
,
bitterly, who, with grief perceived
that she was inclined with all her
resistance
Vol. 2, Sig. 5.
to regard the prince with favor
rather than with anger and detestation.
But he had not seen Abdelases in her
presence after she was brought into the
city, for it was by his order that the
captain
of the Zenetan horsemen took her
captive. Instead of bringing her to his
Seraglio he had ordered the captain to
take her to his former palace, that in
which Alfonzo now discovered her.
Here she was delivered to the charge of
female slaves, and after a bath was robed
by them in magnificent apparel and
conducted
to the sumptuous apartments in
the casement of which she was now
conversing
with Alfonzo.
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE CALIPH AND HIS CAPTIVE.
After the fair captive had recovered a
little from her surprise on finding herself
thus treated, rather as if she were a
princess
than a mountain maiden, and her
alarm at finding herself in the power of
Abdelases (for the captain had told her it
was by his order he had acted) had
subsided
,
she began to contemplate her
condition
.
It was no new thing to her to
know that the Moorish chief stole fair
christian girls from their homes to make
them slaves in Cordova. She knew that
such was to be her condition. She was
not so miserable as she would have been
had her heart been interested in any
youth of her native Scerias; but she was
heart-free. She had no one to think of,
therefore, but herself and her brother and
Gaspar, her father. For these she shed
tears. The Moorish captain had told her
that she was not to be sold like other
maidens in the lagoon, but that the prince
would himself honor her by making her
his slave.
She paced up and down the gorgeous
apartments, now melted to tears, now
burning with anger, now tortured with
fear. She had heard that Abdelases was
cruel, and she knew that she must
prepare
to die; for she resolved to treat
him with scorn and defiance, and thus
by her coldness so enrage him as to
induce
him to command her execution.
She knew that he would visit her. The
principal slave of the palace had told her
the prince would visit her. She would
have torn off the jewels and rich robes
and trampled upon them, but she caught
sight of herself in a mirror, and let them
remain.
Suddenly a door opened, and a young
man entered with a princely air. She
uttered an exclamation of mingled
surprise
and pleasure. She recognised the
guest at the hamlet, of whom she had
thought with more kindness and leniency
since his departure, than she had felt
while he was present. Indeed he had
been very much in her thoughts,
considering
that he was an Infidel. Upon
now recognising him, she was moved
with surprise, pleasure, and not a little
with fear. He approached. She shrunk
back, and as he advanced, she retreated.
The casement arrested her receding
steps. She still regarded him as he ap
proached with curiosity and alarm, yet
the former emotion seemed strongest.
`Fair Xariffa,' he said, `why do you
fly me?'
`Why am I here? Tell Abdelasis if
he sent thee, that I am his prisoner, but
I will never be his slave. Did he fear
to behold one whom he had wronged,
that he sent thee? Was it by thy
report
that he heard of me? If so, let what
little kindness in my heart there remains
for thee, turn to hatred and scorn.'
`Maiden,' said the youthful Caliph,
approaching
her with a smile, yet with an
air of deference, `in me you behold
Abdelasis
.
It was Abdelasis who was your
guest.'
At hearing these words, she stood
gazing upon him with amazement, and
not without a beam of gratification
lighting
up the cloud which had been
gathering
upon her brow. She saw that the
worst was now made known, that the
Abdelasis she had trembled to think
upon
,
was before her, and in the person of
the handsome stranger who had declared
at her feet his deep passion for her.
She knew not which most to fear, the
young Moor as a supposed Saracen
cavalier
,
or Abdelasis, the powerful.
`You tremble, maiden. You need
not fear me,' he said, kindly. `By
Allah
,
I swear to thee that thou art as free
as air, and that I will not harm thee!'
`Then if I am free, send me back to
my father's roof, to the protection of my
brother!' she said, with spirit.
`Do not scorn my love, Christian
maiden
,'
said the prince, kneeling at her feet.
`I am your captivenot you mine.
This heart is yours, sacredly and
faithfully
yours,' he added, placing his hand
with graceful earnestness upon his heart,
and looking up into her face with eyes
that beamed with love and adoration.
She would have fled between fear of him
and fear of herself, for she felt that her
bosom was relenting. But the casement
towards which she had retreated, was too
high, and she could not escape from
listening to the ardent eloquent
out-pouring
of his passion.
It was impossible that she should
listen
without being moved. She felt that
if he were a Christian, she should hear
him with pleasure, and requite with
gratitude
love so profound and sincere as
his seemed to be.
`Xariffa, thou art ice,' he at length
said, as she remained immoveable.
`I know not what to say. I am a
Christian, thou a Moor. I am a Spanish
woman, thou art a Saracen, and my
country's foe and oppressor. I cannot
listen to thee. I cannot love thee. Do
not talk to me of love, noble Prince. If
I am free as thou hast said, send me at
once freely away. Thou knowest, Prince,
a Christian maiden may not give her
love to a Moslem!'
`I would almost become a Christian
for thy sake, sweet Xariffa.'
`You mock me. I know that thou and
thine are so wedded to thy faith that you
never change.'
`I have known Christians to change,
why wilt not thou?'
`Thou hast known only base renegades
to become Mussulmen.'
`Why, there is the nobleman, Senor
Velez, in this city, who is a follower of
the true Prophet, and worships in the
Mosques.'
`I am ashamed for him, and for Spain
that has such nobles, Prince,' she
answered
with spirit. `I will, weak woman as I
am, try to atone for his treachery to his
country and to his Redeemer, by being
steadfast.'
`Then you will not pity my great love
for thee.'
`No, Caliph, I can never consent to
give my heart to one who hates the cross
and Him crucified thereon. So, if I am
at liberty, as thou hast first said, suffer
me to be taken whence I was rudely
taken.'
`Nay, I cannot let thee go. I will now
bid thee good bye, sweet Xariffa, for a
time, trusting thou wilt think better of
me when you reflect upon my love. So
I offer to share with thee my crown and
power. Thou shalt reign with Abdelasis.
Our union shall be the band to unite
Spain and Islam. We will make one
nation in the land.'
`Christ may not dwell with Belial.
There can be no mingling of oil and
wine. Either the land must be Moslem
or Christian; and what would you have
me? Think not, noble Prince, I could
for thy sake give up my faith; and I know
thou wilt not depart from thine, false
though it be.'
`By the beard of Mehemet, maiden,
thou hast spirit enough for a princess.
Thy commanding eye and firmness of
bearing are imperial. Thou wouldst
grace a throne, were it that of Suliman.
Have I thy answer?'
`Thou hast.'
`Dost thou not fear me?'
`Yes, but I fear God more.'
`Dost thou not know that I can make
thee my slave, and that I am
condescending
to sue to thee thus?'
`I know that I am in thy power, but I
do not believe thou wouldst degrade it
and thyself, by using it as thou hast
intimated
.'
`You speak truly, Xariffa. I love thee,
too well, to make thee my slave. I again
repeat thou art free to'
`To go?'
`Noto love me or hate me.'
`How can I love my gaoler?'
`I am in hopes to tame thee by
keeping
thee in this pretty cage. I am in
hopes that my kindness and my efforts to
render thee happy will melt thy heart.
Do not reply; I cannot bear to hear thee
say anything that will destroy my hopes.
Fare thee well, Xariffa. I will go away
but I shall leave behind me all that can
make thee truly happy. It is true, I am
seated upon the throne of the Emirs, but
I feel far from being happy, so long as
I am rejected from the throne of thy
heart. Think of me, Xariffa. Think of
my love, my devotion, my happiness
which thou hast in thy keeping. Be
pitiful
,
and forget that I am not a Christian
like thyself.'
`I can never'
`Not a word, sweet maidennot
another
word. Fare well; and perhaps
to-morrow I will come and see thee again.
In the meantime, think upon me as
kindly
as thou canst.'
With these words, the Prince, with
real sadness and disappointment, took a
respectful leave of his beautiful captive,
and she was once more left alone.
She paced the room in troubled thought.
she felt that he had a power over her
heart, that she dared not contemplate
calmly. She felt that his love, so sincere
and so respectful, demanded from her a
better return than she had met it with.
She felt deeply his delicacy and
forbearance
,
when she knew that he might
command. She knew that only sincere
and sacred love could have dictated such
reverence and courtesy.
His love pleaded to her heart most
strongly in his behalf;but duty, her
duty as a Spanish woman and a
Christian
,
pleaded with greater energy against
him.
`Oh, that he were a Christian!' she
sighed; `then indeed I might listen to
him without guilt. But now, I must turn
a deaf ear to his eloquent words, and
close my eyes to the fire of his eye,
Let me not forget that he is my country's
foelet me not forget he is the enemy
of the Cross! Oh, that I were free in
my native mountains.'
Thus tortured and in suspense between
the Prince's love and her sense of duty,
she continued to walk her gorgeous
apartments
,
till at length, wearied with the
conflict, she sank upon her knees, and in
tears and prayers sought relief and
guidance
.
The next that she heard of her lover
was his voice beneath her casement the
evening of the same day, singing to her
a song full of the most earnest passion;
for Abdelasis was truly and irresistibly
captivated by the fair Christian girl; and
although she was in his power, his love
invested her with a sacredness in his eyes
that was her secure safeguard.
Alfonzo, be it remembered, was
ignorant
of these events, and of the bias in
Xariffa's mind towards her princely
captor
,
or he would not have marvelled as
he did to notice that absence of fear and
disposition to speak favorably of
Abdelasis
,
which she manifested; for he saw
that she did not seem to be so
overwhelmed
with terror as he supposed she would
have been, in the power of such a man.
`Xariffa,' he said, lifting his eyes once
more earnestly to the casement, `I see
that unless I secure your escape at once,
you will become a willing captive of the
Caliph. I know not by what spells he
hath charmed your heart, or by what
weakness you have been betrayed to
listen
to him; but I see that thou art as
willing to be a captive as to be free.'
`Brother, you do me wrong!' she
answered
with spirit. `I would escape if it
were possible without periling your life;
but you may see that I connot descend
from this casement, and even should you
be able to reach it, you could not
conduct
me in safety from the palaceit is
strictly guarded.'
`Lady, the Prince comes!' said a
beautiful
slave, who came that instant to the
casement and looked down.
`Fly, Alfonzo,' cried Xariffa; `fear
not for me! I will be true to myself and
to my faith. Fly! if you are taken here
you are lost!' she then waved her hand
and disappeared.
Alfonzo had had time to see that the
maiden who came to notify her of the
Prince's presence was exceedingly
beautiful
,
slight of figure, and spoke as if she
was the friend rather than the spy of his
sister. He felt it his duty to obey and
escape from the gardens, and sought the
distant gate by which he had entered,
greatly troubled in his mind as to Xariffa's
fate; for he began to tremble for her
faith under the dangerous influence of
the insinuating Caliph.
CHAPTER XIX.
THE TURBAN-MAKER AND HIS GUEST.
Alfonzo
, upon reaching the court of
the Senor Velez, found all quiet as he
had left it half an hour before. He,
however, had discovered his sister in the
power of Abdelasis, yet respected by
him, and in danger of forgetting her duty
as a Christian woman through the power
of his love. But it was out of his power
to save her; and to attempt it, might
result in his own captivity; and he felt
that he was not his own, but belonged to
those who had chosen him to be their
leader in the coming revolution.
He approached the street-gate, and
unbarring it, looked out to see if he could
discover any signs of the return of the
Spanish noble from his friends. But the
street was silent. The moonlight lay
broadly upon one side of it, lighting up
the Morisco edifices with a brilliancy and
beauty that the noon-day sun never could
lend to them. Here and there the black
shadow of a tree lay across the field of
moonlight. From a distance came to his
ear low sounds of music, and remotely
he heard the winding of a bugle, but
whether outside or within the walls, he
could not tell; the notes, however, he
knew to be Moorish; for it had been a
score of years since a Spanish bugle had
waked the echoes of the walls of
Cordova
.
`I will ramble up the street,' he said.
`All is quiet, and if I see any one, I will
retire into the shade, and so avoid them.
As a Moor, I may pass on safely to the
great square. It will be yet an hour ere
the Senor Velez returns!'
Thus speaking, he closed the gate after
him, and grasping his scymetar firmly,
he walked along up the narrow street on
the dark side of the way. He was
pleased
at the beauty of the Moorish edifices,
all the outlines of their elaborate
architecture
,
being finely relieved in the light
and shadow of the moon-beams. The
arched gate-ways, the tall, deep
casements
,
the heavy cornices and
battlements
,
all attracted his eyes, unused to
the magnificence of cities.
Finding all quiet as he went on, he
continued his way until he came to the
entrance into the great square. Here
the view that met his gaze was splendid
beyond conception. The noble mosques,
the palaces of the Emirs, the royal
Seraglio
were all visible at once embracing
the vast area in a magnificent and
sublime
array of terraces and porticoes,
columns and domes, towers and miniarets,
with a hundred silver crescents, shining
like a constellation of moons above all.
He stood a moment and contemplated
the scene, and in his heart prayed that
God would ere long give these palaces
once more into the hands of Christian
Spain.
There were guards both on horse and
foot in front of the palace of Abdelasis,
but where Alfonzo himself stood, no one
was moving. He now saw that the
palace
in which he had seen Xariffa was
not on the square before him, for it was
to the north, on his left. By reflecting a
moment, he believed he could find its
front, and thus by personal inspection,
ascertain exactly how strongly it was
guarded; and whether, if he could gain
access by the casement, he should be
able to escape with her some other way.
With this object in his mind, he turned
out of the square to the left, and by
mentally
comparing the situation of Senor
Velez's abode with the situation of the
casement, he was enabled to find the
street upon which it fronted.
`He went down this street and came
to a high wall overhung with foliage, and
farther on was a massive gate-way,
within
which he heard voices. He crossed
over, and under cover of the black
shadows
of the opposite side of the way
sawhimself unseenthat this was the
enclosure of the palace he sought, and
that at its entrance, a guard of four
soldiers
was placed. Two of them were
walking up and down before it, the other
two were seated upon a bench, playing
in the moonlight at
Ta-bish
, a popular
Moorish game, with date stones. Upon
the terrace of the palace, he saw also,
two armed figures standing, doubtless,
sentries, to prevent the escape of the
fair captive.
Alfonzo saw at a glance, that it would
be impossible for him to rescue his sister
alone, and return with her as he had
hoped to do, to the mountains, after his
own mission to Cordova should be
terminated
.
He went on, however, to the
extremity of the lofty wall, in belief that
he might find some opening less
strongly
guarded; but he found no other gate.
He was about to turn back, giving up
the hope of recovering his sister, and
anxious lest she shonld be led by the
love and rank of the Caliph to renounce
her faith, when his eye fell on a scarlet
turban made of wood and painted,
suspended
over the door of a humble
habitation
,
but a few paces further down the
street.
His heart bounded with joy and
delighted
surprise. He recollected that
this was the sign of the house of the
Moor, Yussef Ben Habib, where Ben
Osmin was sojourning with Genilla. He
sprung forward with the sudden impulse
which his wishes gave to his feet, but
as suddenly checked himself:
`There are many turban makers in
Cardova, and this may not be the shop
of Ben Habib. Rut I will not go away
till I ascertain. All this while I have
been wishing that I knew the street, that
I might at least look upon the house
where Genilla dwells, and lo, here I
have, without doubt, stumbled upon it!
I will see her if she be here!'
He then looked about him carefully to
see that he was not observed, and then
stepped across the street to the door, over
which hung the scarlet turban. The
house was of stone, one story in height,
had once been white washed, but was
now very dingy with age and neglect,
apparently by its exterior, proclaiming
the poverty of Ben Habib, whose wife
the reader will remember, was chosen by
Ben Osmin, as the nurse for his protege
Genilla, after he found her wrapped up
in the bale of shawls, in the mysterious
manner already related.
The house was buried in repose, aud
seemed to be closely shut up. He
resolved
,
however, to make some
demonstrations
towards ascertaining if the fair
Moorish girl was an inmate of it. He
had discovered the name `Yussuf Ben
Habib,' written over the top of the door,
in Arabic characters, with green chalk.
This discovery assured him that this was
the house in which Ginella was to be
found, if she were in Cordova. To
commence
beating upon the gate, after the
custom of applicants, with Moorish
tenements
,
he did not feel safe in doing, so
near the guard at the great gate of the
palace enclosure, which was not more
than two hundred yards distant. He
therefore looked for some way of ingress
to the court in the rear, for he knew that
all Moorish dwellings had a fountain, and
court, and garden, either of larger or
smaller dimensions, for every Moslem
citizen, however humble, had his
fountain
for his ablutions, though it be an
earthen one; and a court to sit in to
take his coffee, though it be but twelve
feet square; and a garden to give him
shade, though it be not able to hold more
than two date trees.
At the side of Ben Habib's house, he
found the roof terminate in a wall about
ten feet in height, over which crept a
vine. By the aid of the strong,
cordlike
tenderils of the vine, he drew
himself
up to the top of the wall, and
descended
into a little square court, which
was not ten steps either way in length
or breadth. In the centre was a brick
fountain, shaded by a fig-tree. He
advanced
a few steps from the wall, and
was able to look into the open corridor
of the Moor's humble house, upon the
paved floor of which, the moonlight
streamed like a flood of silver.
This corridor was a sort of outer hall,
open to the air, and having doors to lead
into the front rooms of the dwelling. One
of these doors was open, and showed a
lamp within, suspended above a bench,
on which sat a bald-headed mussulman
busily engaged in folding silk and muslin
into a suitable form to make turbans. He
was a short fat Moor with a full face of
good humor and simplicity. Opposite
to him was Ben Osmin, reclining on a
divan, and talking with Ben Habib.
Genilla
was not visible, and Alfonzo looked
towards a small apartment on the left of
Ben Osmin, which, he believed, held her
from his wistful gaze. He advanced a
step noiselessly, and bent forward, hoping
that she might be screened only by the
half-open door of the room in which they
were; but he could not discover her. A
word or two from Ben Habib arrested his
ear, and he instantly became interested
in the conversation.
`And this is all true that the Christian
hermit told you, brother,' was the
remark
of Ben Habib, looking up from his
work, and fixing his small, keen Moorish
eyes on the face of Ben Osmin.
`Yes, brother. He came to me on
purpose to tell me this. And I see it all
now. I can see how that priest Paulus
used to try and make a Christian of her,
till I told him I would make him a head
shorter if he spoke to Genilla of the cross
of the Nazarene again. I see it all, but
I love her not a whit less because she has
Christian blood in her veins.'
`How strange that a Christian monk
should have sent to thee a Christian
infant
to keep. He might have known she
would have grown up to be a follower of
the true Prophet, for which Allah be
thanked. Did he tell you who her
mother
was or her father?'
`No; he came to me three days ago,
and told me that this Paulus, whom we
thought such a good Moslem, had told
him, that the infant I had received in a
bale of shawls was the daughter of
Christian
parents of high rank; that its life had
been saved by him only by the most
extraordinary
exertions on his part, when
all her race perished, and that finding he
could not protect it longer, and knowing
my goodness of heart, (for he paid me
this compliment, Ben Habib; and
deserved
too,' remarked the turban-maker,
parenthetically,) he sent her to me in
the manner you have often been told.
Since then he has watched over her as a
Moslem and Mufti, though at heart he
was a Nazarene. He said that Paulus
did not intend she should remain with me
any longer than he could find a safe
asylum
for her, for fear of her becoming a
Moslem; but circumstances prevented his
giving her his protection; and last week
he died, telling father Godfrey these
things.'
`And yet this Paulus as a Moslem,
used to come and try to make her a
Christian
,
you say.'
`I have my suspicions that he did; but
I never liked to trust a converted
Christian
,
and so I had my eye upon him, and
finally forbade him the Emir's tower.'
`Well, what is to be done?'
`The father Godfrey, who seems to be
a good man for a Christian, told me that
the maiden was very rich, and that if I
would come to Cordova he would point
out where the wealth was secreted, and
give me half of it if I would surrender
Genilla to him.'
`On my soul be it,this was a request.'
`It was. I pretended to assent to this
though I would part with my life
sooner
than with my Genilla, though she had
all the Christian blood of Jerusalem in her
veins.'
`She is no worse a Moslem for that,
brother.'
`No. I deceived the holy hermit,
and came hither where he said he would
meet me, and unfold to me the wealth of
which Genilla has been so long deprived.
He should have been here to-night by his
promise,' answered Ben Osmin, looking
towards the street door, and listening.
CHAPTER XX.
THE MERCHANT AND HIS GUEST.
There
was a moment's pause in the
conversation, during which Alfonzo had
time to reflect rapidly upon the
wonderful
intelligence which he had heard.
Genilla was then of Christian birth, and
not the daughter of Ben Osmin the Moor.
This discovery filled his bosom with
delight
.
There was now no further
obstacle
to the free progress of his love for
the fair young girl; for he felt that he
had only to reveal to her this truth, to
make her a willing convert to the faith
of her fathers.
That the fact was as the conversation
he had overheard led him to see it, he
could not doubt. But he resolved to see
the hermit and learn from him the whole,
confessing his attachment to her and
persuading
him to unfold her history. He
now understood why father Godfrey had
made that mysterious visit to the Emir's
tower; and in his heart he said,`He
will no longer be displeased with me for
gazing on the tower and thinking upon
the fair occupant of the cottage by its
walls; he will gladly assent to our union,
hoping, as I hope, that through me she
be restored to the fold of the church.'
Suddenly the voice of Ben Habib
roused him from his pleasing meditations.
`How much gold think you, brother,
the maiden has?'
`That I know not; the hermit said it
was a large sum in gold and jewels,
which Paulus had hidden for her in some
safe place in Cordova, where it had
remained
twenty years.'
`I would I had found it. What do you
mean to do when he gives thee half, and
refuse to give up the maiden to him?'
`I will tell him I will keep Genilla for
the other half which I make over to him.
This will be fair dealing, brother, with a
Christian dog!'
`It is no harm, but rather a virtue, to
deceive them. But he may not let thee
have the gold till he have thy daughter.
But hist!the maiden may be listening.'
`Noshe sleeps soundly; I saw that
before we began our talk.'
`It would be bad to be overheard by
her, as she might play against us.'
`She loves me too well; she would
not leave me, brother Ben Habib. It
would break her little heart.'
`I have no doubt of it!But surely I
heard a noise!' cried the little
turban-maker
,
as he glanced around with a quick,
searching glance.
He
did
hear a noiseit was the
footstep
of Alfonzo, who, finding that he
could learn nothing more, and that
Genilla
was asleep and in safety,
recollecting
his engagement with Senor Velez,
retired from the corridor, but not without
striking a loose brick of the paved floor.
He rapidly sealed the wall, and lighted
undiscovered in the street, along which
he moved rapidly, to hasten back to the
merchant's house. He had made happy
discoveries during the two hours' absence
of Senor Velez:he had found where
Xariffa was imprisoned, and that she
rather
loved her cage than desired to be
stolen from it!he had found Genilla,
and learned not only her safety, but that
she had now claims to his regard more
sacred and stronger than ever.
He took his way with a light tread
along the street, and so wholly wrapped
in the sweet thoughts of Genilla that he
came unexpectedly upon two men at the
corner of a street into which he was
turning. He stepped back and drew his
scymetarthe foremost stranger did the
same.
They confronted each other for a
momeat
in hostile attitude, the third
standing
a little behind the second, when
Alfonzo
thought he recognised the height
and air of the latter.
`Art thou not Senor Velez?' he said.
`Yes; and thou?'
`Alfonzo!'
`Rash young man! How is it that I
find you in the street?'
`I was weary remaining at home,
Senor, and invited by the moonlight I
rambled forth. I have met with no
mishap and have found all quiet!'
`That was not your fault, my friend.
Come we will hasten homeward.'
`Is not this the way?'
`Not as you were going. You see
how imprudent you are, my noble friend.
You might have been lost; and as guards
of horsemen patrol the street every hour
you would certainly have been arrested
and discovered. I am glad I met with
thee! Let us hasten homeward.'
`Have you brought good tidings,
Senor?' asked Alfonzo, suddenly
forgetting
Genilla, Xariffa and every thing
but Spain and her wrongs!
`Yes! I have given the news to ten
brave and true men. Ere this they have
conveyed it to ten more. By sun-rise a
thousand Christian slaves in Cordova
will know that Alfonzo the Destroyer
has resolved to lift the standard of the
Cross on the eve of San Diego upon the
rock of St. Paul. The news will go
from lip to lip till a fire shall run through
all the veins of the bondmen of our blood
in the city. They will keep the secret
and await the signal to srike for Spain
and liberty!'
Thanks, thanks, noble Velez! I am
already inspired by thy tidings,'
answered
Alfonzo, as he walked homeward
with him, the Nubian slave following
close behind him with his no longer
needful lantern in his hand.
Upen entering the house, and once
more being seated, Senor Velez gave a
minute relation of what he had done
which convinced Alfonzo that he should
receive the co-operation of almost as
many strong arms within the walls of the
Moors as without. He then related to
the Senor his own adventures and even
unfolded to him his love for Genilla now
that he could speak of her as the
daughter
of Christian parents. The merchant
heard him with profound surprise. He
said, after some reflection,
`What you have told me amazes me
all of it! But I trust that your sister
does not feel as kindly towards
Abdelasis
as you suspect. Doubtless she
consulted
more your safety than her own in
refusing to permit you to risk your life
in trying to save her! And if you had
done so where could you have taken her?
If you had brought her here she would
have been discovered by the emissaries
of the Caliph. If you had escaped from
the city with her in disguise it would
have been to desert a cause which calls
for all your energies and devotion.'
`True!'
`Forget her and give your thoughts
to your country, Alfonzo!'
`I will do so!'
`Yet one word touching this daughter
of Ben Osmin! Said you that the
father
Godfrey did not know her
parentage
?'
`He did not name it to Ben Osmin.
Doubtless he was informed by Paulus!'
`I knew this priest Paulus well. He
was confessor to the late Duke de
Cordova
brother to our good King Amalarie,
whose memory Heaven bless forever.
Paulus was a faithful adherent of the
House of Amalarie and for years after
the slaughter of the king and his
household
by the order of the Emir Taric I
supposed he had shared their fate. But
seven years ago I met him as I was
travelling up the valley near the Pass of
Roncesvar.'
`He was habited as a recluse. He
told me he lived in the mountains, and
devoted his life to the returning glory of
Spain. Since then I have heard nothing
of him till now. And now I hear that
he died a few days ago, leaving behind,
in the ears of father Godfrey, this
singular
revelation. Do you know, Alfonzo,
that I have my suspicions!' said Senor
Velez, with a significant look and an
animated air.
`And I mine!'
`What are they?'
`That Genilla may belong to some one
of the noble houses connected with the
Duke de Cordova!'
`More than this. I believe, from her
age and your description of her, that she
is the daughter of the Duke himself,
saved by Paulus from death, at the risk
of his own life, and placed with a Moor
for preservation, as once a dying mother
laid her infant in the midst of a litter of
lion's whelps!'
`Had the Duke a daughter who was
then an infant?'
`Yes; I was at its christening. It was
believed to have perished.'
`Genilla must be that infant, I feel
persuaded!'
`So also do I. I will draw the whole
matter from father Godfrey. If it be
true, then Spain has a Princess at least,
and may hold up her head!'
`And I droop mine own. For how
will a princess look upon a peasant's love?'
`Thy union may yet be ordered by
Heaven as the salvation of the realm. If
she be a princess, indeed, she can have no
kindom, save by thy prowess. But let
these matters rest till we see father
Godfrey
.
He will doubtless unfold all to me!'
At this moment was heard a tapping
upon the outside of the street-gate. As
it was some time past midnight, Senor
Velez looked surprised, and rose himself
to go to the gate before ordering his slave
to open it.
`Open, my good lord,' said the visitor.
`It is Athir!' exclaimed Alfonzo, who
had gone to the wicket with him.
The gate was then unbarred and the
youthful Moor admitted. He wore the
dress of a royal page, a very elegant and
graceful costume, which set his figure off
to the best advantage. His turban was
of pink silk entwined with a scarf of
spangled muslin; his bernish was of
bright yellow satin, bound with a gold
border; and his vest was blue velvet,
spangled with stars. He wore full
muslin
drawers, that nearly hid in the ample
volume his red morocco gilt slippers.
About his waist was bound a green sash,
in which was stuck a silver-hilted
yataghan
and a jewelled dagger.
`How is this fine display, Athir? You
have made your two pieces of gold go a
great ways,your costume is worth a
hundred
bezets!
' exclaimed Alfonzo,
surveying
him.
`I bought a coarser garb at the bazaar,
my lord,' answered Athir, who seemed to
be conscious how well he looked with his
fine face and manly figure, to set off his
rich costume; `but not liking it well, I
went into the pages' bed-chamber, and
while the idle rogues slept, I helped
myself
to the best suit among them that I
could find; and donning it, I felt much
more at my ease.'
`Then you went into the palace of the
Caliph?'
`All over it, my lord, wheresoever a
page's slipper is permitted to echo. I
talked with many, and especially had a
social talk with old Belzar, the chief
eunuch, who was as communicative as I
could desire;and the result is, I am
satisfied that Xariffa is not in the harem
of the Seraglio.'
`You have performed your duty well
and faithfully, Athir: Xariffa is found
she is in the private palace of
Abdelasis
,
which is not far distant on the next
street.'
CHAPTER XXI.
THE MEETING OF THE LONG-SEVERED.
At
the intelligence thus unexpectedly
conveyed to him, Athir manifested his
surprise and pleasure.
`Allah be praised!' he cried: `I will
aid my lord in recovering her.'
`And, perhaps, you can aid me, Athir,'
answered Alfonzo, after a moment's
reflection
.
He then briefly stated how he had
discovered
her, and his fears that if she
were suffered to remain longer in the
power and presence of Abdelasis she
might return his love for her.
`Are you confident in your disguise?'
asked Alfonzo.
`It has saved me from detection in the
Seraglio itself, my lord. But I have here
a talisman.'
`What is this?' asked Alfonzo, as he
took from his hand a large signet.
`It is what I have seen often,'
interposed
Senor Velez: `it is the Caliph's
private seal.'
`It is, my lord,' answered Athir, as
Alfonzo fastened on him a glance of
surprise
and inquiry. `I took it from his
own chamber, for he was absent
doubtless
at the palace of his captive. I saw
it there, and took it without much
reflection
about itbut believing that it might
be of service to thee.'
`It was a bold act, and may be useful.
Can you gain admittance into the palace
with it?'
`Without doubt, my lord.'
`Then go and see Xariffa, and say to
her from whom you come, and urge her
to fly with you to the Sierras. Will you
not accompany her?'
`Wherever my noble benefactor
commands
.
I will do all I can to save her;
if she will not come with me, I will re
turn to you. What token shall I give her
to prove that you sent me?'
`Take this keyit is known to her.'
The youthful Moor was going out upon
his mission, when Senor Velez said to
him,
`When thou returnest, come by the
way of the gardens; yonder gate on the
other side of the court will let thee in
and shall be left unhasped for thee.
The gardens are the Caliph's, who, when
Emir, let those who dwelt around them
walk in them at certain hours daily.'
Athir was then let out by the street
door, and was departing, when a troop of
the mounted city guard came galloping
by. He quickly drew within the gate
and when their retiring hoofs were heard
at a distance, he again sallied forth.
Leaving Alfonzo to discuss farther the
details of the contemplated revolution
which was to place Spain once more
under
the Christian rule, we will follow the
disguised page to the gate of the palace
where Alfonzo had seen the four guards
stationed. He presented his signet
boldly
,
and was at once admitted with great
respect. A slave was called, who
conducted
him to the corridor of the palace
where the chief eunuch received him and
led him through a suite of magnificent
halls towards the apartments occupied by
Xariffa. Athir had adroitly ascertained
at the gate that the Caliph had a long
time before departed to his royal palace
on the great square.
Upon reaching the ante-room to her
apartments, the eunuch said, bowing his
head to the ground in the presence of the
Caliph's messenger:
`Does my lord Effendi wish to see the
Christian slave in person, or speak with
one of her attendants, and through he
convey his Highness' message to the
maiden.'
`I will see hergo and announce me.
The eunuch advanced, and lifting a
massive curtain of gold and silk, heavily
woven in gorgeous figures, he revealed
a columed chamber, with alabaster panel
exquisitely painted with birds of the
richest
plumage. The floor was mosaic, and
the roof frescoed in the highest style of
Moorish art, blue and gold contrasting
with white being the prevailing colors.
At the extremity of this beautiful
apartment
,
upon a raised dais overlaid with the
most costly and brilliant colors, sat
Xariffa
,
the half-willing, half-trembling
captive
of the powerful Abdelasis.
At her feet, a little removed, crouched
in an attitude of natural grace, sat the
beautiful Arabian maid her attendant,
whom Alfonzo had seen appear at the
casement, and warn her of the approach
of the Prince after his serenade. She
had a roquelin, or Moorish guitar, in her
hands, upon the strings of which her
taper
fingers were arrested by the
appearance
of the eunuch, towards whom she
turned her large black eyes enquiringly.
Xariffa had been listening to the sweet
voice of the young girl, who was singing,
or rather improvising, a tale of love in
her own experience, accompanying the
romantic and touching narrative with a
thrilling touch now and then upon the
strings of her guitar.
`Christian, a message from the Caliph,'
said the eunuch, speaking with the
machine-like
action of an automaton.
`I do not wish any message of the
Prince but one, to tell me that I am free,'
answered Xariffa with spirit. `He must
not come in unless he brings such.
Come, maiden, go on with thy sad story:
tell me if thy father, the chief, never
relented
when he found thou didst so mourn
the handsome youth, whom love for thee
compelled to flee.'
`No, ladyhe was austere and cruel
after this, and made me a prisoner in his
own mountain hold. But true love has
its own power. I escaped, and in
disguise
of a youth reached, after many
hapless
wanderings, these shores of Spain.
Here I hoped I might find him who was
dearer to me than the sun is to the green
earth.'
`And has thou ne'er met him?'
`No, lady, but I have heard that he
was a page to the Emir Algezir and
afterwards
became a wanderer in the
Sierras
!
I know not where he is now!'
`And how is it thou art the slave of
Abdelasis?'
`I was his page, also, till a month ago
when, as I slept, my vest opening
exposed
my bosom. He made me tell
him my whole story, and when he had
listened attentively to it, he bade me
take courage for if Athir were alive
I should yet behold him; for he said
nothing would give him so much happi
ness as to see me united to him I had so
faithfully loved. I have since been
honorably
entreated in the palace where I
served as page; and yesterday when he
brought thee hither he bade me please
him by endeavoring to make thee happy
and to love him!'
`He is nobler than I believed. Thou
has taken off one half my dislike to him
for his kindness to thee. Here comes
the Eunuch again to interrupt us! Sir
Eunuch, it is past midnight; and because
I choose to sit up and watch the moon I
am not compelled to receive at such an
hour the Caliph's messengers.'
`He comes of his own will, Christian,'
answered the Eunuch, standing aside and
letting Athir advance.
`Say to Abdelasis, fair page,' cried
Xariffa, rising, `that this is not fulfilling
his promise given me when he left, that
I should not be intruded upon ere
to-morrow
!
Ha! what is this? What
has happened, child? How wildly you
stare! Who'
Her words of surprise were
interrupted
by a loud shriek of heart heart
breaking
joy from the bosom of the Arabian
girl and a cry of gladness co-mingling
with it from the lips of the noble looking
youth.
`Nube!'
`Athir!'
These two words uttered with accents
of the deepest-toned human, joy told her
the whole story of lovers parted and
and meeting again. Nube made but one
bound to reach the approaching arms of
Athir and her head sunk lifeless upon his
shoulder while her arms clung around
him as if she would never release her
hold again.
`My Nube! My long-lost, found
Nube!' articulated Athir, with tender joy,
as he gazed down upon her face and
folded her again and again to his heart.
Xariffa gazed upon this scene of
happiness
with tearful eyes and a smile
sparkling upon her countenance. In a
few minutes Nube slowly raised her face
all smiles and tears, and dishevelled
tresses, and said softly to her, and oh,
what a world to her in those two
syllables
,
`Athir!' and then she once more
buried her face in his bosom!'
The breathless questioning, the
explanations
,
the thousand expressions of
grateful joy, to all of which Xariffa
listened
,
that followed this happy re-union
who shall record! The bliss of the
lovers was complete. It seemed to them
that there was no sorrow on earth.
At length Xariffa said to the happy
lover, `You will now hasten and inform
the Caliph of your discovery, that he
may rejoice with you!'
`Alas, lady,' said Nube, `he cannot
rejoice save you smile on him! Be not
cruel! Let an hour so blessed to me
and to Athir be also blessed to the Prince
and to you.'
`Nay, sweet Nube,' interposed Athir,
with a smile; `I cannot have you urge
the lady to favor the Prince! I am not
in the service of Abdelasis!'
`In whose?' asked Xariffa, with
surprise
.
Athir briefly related his history as it is
already known to the reader, up to the
time of his being ushered into the
apartment
by the Eunuch. He spoke freely
and with confidence knowing he was
with those who would not betray him.
When Xariffa heard his message to her
she sighed, and said,
`I cannot go with you! Nor will you
wish to leave Nube to escape with me!'
`She can go with us!'
`No, it is your duty to remain here
with her, and to-morrow let the Prince
learn from her lips who you are. He
will rejoice. I will intercede with him
to pardon you for taking his signet,
which you will now give me; and return
at once to Alfonzo and tell him that I
I' Here the Christian maiden
hesitated
and blushed.
`I will end the sentence for thee,
lady,' answered Nube, smiling; `tell
him that you love the Prince Abdelasis
and mean to make him happy by sharing
his throne and heart.'
`Nono'
`Yes! It is so! I see it, lady!'
answered
Athir. For Alfonzo's sake only
am I sorry! He will grieve to hear it!'
`Nay, I have not said that I love
Abdelasis
!'
`Nowords are less eloquent than
thy throbbing bosom and beaming eye
as he is spoken of!'
`Tell my brother that I feel that I can
prevail upon the Caliph to embrace
Christianity!'
`Allah forbid!' ejaculated both the
Arabian girl and her lover.
Xariffa smiled at their earnestness,
and said.
`Go, Athir. To-morrow at noon come
hither, and the Prince will receive thee,
and thou shalt be made happy and Nube
too!'
`What shall I say to Alfonzo?'
`Urge him to caution lest he should
be discovered; and tell him that I know
the Prince will treat me with all honour.
Urge him to return to the mountains
where in two days he will either see or
hear from me!
Athir embraced Nube tenderly, and
then took his leave of Xariffa with a
heavy cloud shadowing his happy heart.
He bore the news to Alfonzo; and the
brow of the brother darkened, and his
vengeance against Abdelasis was
awakened
anew. But when Athir told him of
his meeting with Nube, the brow of anger
relaxed, and he shewed by the
expression
of his smiling face, that he
sympathized
fully in the happiness of his friend.
CHAPTER XXII.
THE CRISIS OF THE CONSPIRACY.
The eve of St. James at length arrived,
a season to be marked with great events
the downfall of the crescent and the
elevation of the cross.
The emissaries which had departed
from Alfonzo in the forest, to rouse up
the Christians in the mountains, and in
the plains, were everywhere received
with joy and hailed as messengers of
deliverance
.
The name of Alfonzo had
preceded them to the remotest recesses
of the vallies, and been heard by the
farthest
mountaineer. It carried with it a
prestige that favored the messengers.
Every where men were told that Alfonzo
the Destroyer was to raise again the
standard
of the cross on the eve of St. James,
their eyes brightened, they shook off their
slavish indifference, and grasping their
rude weapons, desired to be led against
the Moor.
The edict issned by Abdelasis, calling
for the registering of every man's name,
also contributed to this willingness to take
up arms against the Moslem. They saw
that now was the crisis of their nation's
destiny; that the edict must be resisted
that Spain must be made free.
From hamlet to hamlet, from cabin to
cabin the fifty emissaries went bearing
the wooden cross, and raising the startling
cry.
`Up Christians of Spain! The
standard
of the cross is to be lifted up by the
hand of Alfonzo the Destroyer. Up
Christians of Spain. The eve of St.
James is to be the eve of our national
glory. Arm, Christians of Spain.
Hasten
to the rock of St. Paul on the eve of
St. James. God and Spain! down with
the Moor.
With such words as these did those
zealous mountaineers who had caught the
spirit of Alfonzo, spread the news of the
contemplated movement. No where did
they meet with indifference. The fire
spread and warmed every heart, and
nerved every arm.
Yet all was done secretly and unknown
to the Moor. Each Christian sacredly
kept his own council; and there, in the
very bosom of the Saracen empire, was
gathering a storm-cloud, which, to the
eyes of the Infidel, cast not a shadow
upon
the land. All was sunshine and peace.
Abdelasis had consolidated the kingdom.
He was a descendant of the Prophet, and
vice-general of the Faith of the crescent.
Mo one thought now of questioning his
authority, or of opposing his power. To
Moorish Spain there seemed rising a glory
greater than ever shone over the Moslem
empire of Syria.
The holy father Godfrey was also a
messenger; but he went rather to the
exiled priests in the recesses of the
mountains
than to the peasantry, though he
passed none by. These priests became
emissaries in their turn, and aroused the
nobles who were to be found buried in
their strong-holds, or dwelling in poverty
and degradation in the northern towns of
the Moorish empire. The cry went like
electric fire from lip to lip, and met with
the most thrilling welcome. `The eve
of San Diego' was on every tongue,
blended with the proudly uttered name of
Alfonzo the Destroyer. Every man felt
that a leader was now needed, or all
Spain would have to bend its neck to
the yoke of slavery, and to the faith of
of Mahommet.
In the city of Cordova Senor Velez,
and his friends had not been idle. The
intelligence which he had spread found
willing hearts to receive it.
Affection for the Cross and a desire for
the returning glory of Spain inspired the
bosoms of those who had long been
slaves. Secretly sixteen thousand men
prepared to rise upon their conquerors
and masters as soon as the trumpet of
Alfonzo should be heard at midnight
without the walls, proclaiming his
presence
with an army.
Alfonzo had held frequent secret
meetings
,
at the house of Senor Velez, with
the principal Christians in the city, and
chosen his leaders of division and
regularly
organised the masses, so that they
should act with harmony and effect. To
one was given the assault on the Royal
Palace; to another, to attack the armory,
a round tower near the city; to another,
to occupy one square and the streets
leading to it; and to another division,
another square. Some parties were to
occupy the several palaces, and the chief
party to attack the principal gate on the
inner side, and endeavor to open it for
the entrance of Alfonzo and his army.
Having made all these arrangements
with great wisdom and an almost innate
knowledge of military affairs, Alfonzo,
after remaining four days in Cordova,
returned
from the city to the hamlet. Here
he found Gaspar, who was in the midst
of a body-guard of four hundred
mountaineers
secretly gathered together; and
from him he learned that these could be
depended on a force of at least twelve
thousand armed men. He now
ascended
to the Rock of St. Paul's, which
commanded
a wide view of all the valley of
the Guadalquiver and the city of Cordova,
and here in the presence of these men he
constructed, by their aid, a wooden cross,
which the father Godfrey, who now never
left the side of his young friend, blessed
and consecrated for this purpose. The
cross was whitened, and being, when
erect, thirty feet in height, could be seen
at a great distance.
The eve of St. James (or San Diego)
was now ten days distant. Alfonzo
having
devoted the three next days, during
which armed detachments were
constantly
coming in by the mountain roads, to
the selection of his officers and the
arrangement
of the plan of the revolution,
which he as effectually organised in the
Sierras as he had done within the city,
he resolved once more to revisit Cordova
in diguise. Before deperting, he gave
directions that all who needed provisions
should be supplied from his herd of goats
and gazelles first, and then from those of
the other herdsmen on the Sierras, who
willingly gave them up to the great cause
to which they had devoted life and wealth.
Father Godfrey accompanied him to
Cordova, and both reached the abode of
Senor Velez in safety. Alfonzo had
now leisure to make inquiries of the
hermit
touching the birth of Genilla, and
from him, to his surprise, learned that
she was, as the merchant had suspected,
the daughter of the Duke de Cordava and
the sole heiress to the throne of Spain.
The intelligence rendered the young
lover despondent, for he felt that when
she came to know her rank and (if the
revolution was successful) to be elevated
to the sceptre of the empire, she would
disdain his humble love!
But in these apprehensions he was
deceived
.
Father Godfrey called upon Ben
Osmin, at the abode of Habib, and having
been permitted to have a private
interview
with Genilla, he unfolded to her the
secret of her lineage. Her surprise gave
place to deep reflection; and she at
length said,
`Have you told Ben Osmin, my father,
of this?'
`No. It would not be safe. Spain
looks to you for safety and security.
Alfonzo
loves you. Embrace the faith of
your father's and become the wife of
Alfonzo
,
and let him, in your name, raise
once more the standard of your royal
ancestors.'
The result of the interview was a
desire
on her part to see Alfonzo. They
met privately the same evening while
the hermit, taking Ben Osmin and Yusauf
Habib with him, went to show them the
hidden treasure that he would bestow
upon the former to surrender his
daughter
.
The eloquence and love of Alfonzo
prevailed. Convinced that she was the
child of a Christian race, the daughter of
Christian kings, she promised to embrace
the faith of the Cross in the great
principles
of which she had already been
instructed
not only the priest Paulus, but
by Alfonzo himself. From this hour her
destiny and line of life was separated
from that of Ben Osmin. She felt that
the parting would be painful, but she was
firm in uniting her destinies with those of
Alfonzo and Spain.
Ben Osmin returned laden with jewels,
and the hermit demanded Genilla. But
Ben Osmin laughed and told him that he
might have the other half left in the
vaults of the old ruin of the Duke of
Cordova's
castle they had visited, and he
would keep the maiden. Father Godfrey
protesting, Ben Osmin menaced him with
a complaint to the Caliph for hiding the
wealth of Christian nobles. Genilla
hearing this, became displeased, but
remained
silent. The same night she was
under Alfonzo protection in the house of
Senor Velez, and there in the presence
of a score of the chief conspirators she
was baptized, partook of the Holy
Communion
,
and then receiving the sign of
the cross, was solemnly united in
marriage
with Alfonzo.
Spain now had a leader of right to
conduct her to victory and to power.
The intelligence spread from mouth to
mouth, and from the city reached the
assembled
forces in the mountains. It gave
new life to the revolution. Men felt that
now they had something to fight for
an end to crown their efforts.
In the meanwhile, Xariffa remained an
inmate of the palace of Abdelasis. He
had called the next day to see her, and
was surprised and overjoyed at the
condescension
of her reception. When he
heard from her lips the romantic
narrative
of Nube, he was greatly pleased, and
promised to forgive Athir, who at that
moment came in.
The Prince then made him give an
account
of his adventures, which he did
save that portion, which related to his
service
with Alfonzo, upon which he
remained
silent. The Prince, however
pardoned Athir at Xariffa's solicitation
only on the condition that she would
reciprocate
his love for her, and consent
to become his wife.
`If you will, Xariffa,' he said, `I
promise that the edict whieh you so
deeply
lament and censure me for, shall be
revoked, and that your people shall share
the privileges of citizens equally with
mine.'
`I consent, on condition that you will
permit the Christians in Cordova to
worship
in their cathedral, and suffer a cross
to be erected upon its dome, where now
shines the crescent.'
`I consent to this, fair Xariffa. Now
you see that I truly love you, and honour
you.'
`Have I your royal word that these
things shall be as I ask?'
`I give you my word as Prince and
Caliph, beautiful maiden, beloved ef my
soul.'
`Then I consent to by thy wife,
Abdelasis
;
this sacrifice of my religious
objections
to thy faith, I am willing to make
to remove from my people the heavy
yoke that thou wouldst have put upon
them.'
The next day the marriage of Xariffa
with the Caliph, was solemnized in the
Great Mosque with public rejoicing.
Alfonzo heard of it in the Siarras at
Paul's Rock, and was pained to the heart
at this seeming manifestation of her
falsity
to her faith and country. But Athir,
who also was made happy by being the
same day made the husband of Nube,
came to him from the now Moorish
Princess
,
and made made known to him her
motives.
`It is too late for such a sacrifice to
do any good!' he answered, sadly.
`The sword is drawn and must not be
sheated till Spain be free.'
But Abdelasis proved false to his royal
pledge. He put off from day to day the
revocation of his edict. The eve of San
Diego arrived! Alfonzo stood upon the
Rock of St. Paul, and beheld around him
an army of forty thousand men, for so
readily and warmly had Spain responded
to the call upon her. The moon was just
rising over the peak of Corol when
mounted
upon his charger, he marched at the
head of his forces against the walls of
Cordova, two leagues distant. Already
had Abdelasis got rumour of the
assembling
of forces for a day past in the
Sierras
,
and he was preparing an army to
sally out upon them, not suspecting their
purpose, or guessing at their number.
But as he was in his saddle, reviewing
his troops, in the Great Square, as the
moon rose over the peak of Corol, El
Zegris came dashing up at full speed and
said
`My Prince, pardon me! I am now
thy vassal. I have come into the city to
aid thee in its defence, and was admitted
at the gate, leaving my followers, three
hundred men without. Do I live?'
`Thou art pardoned!'
`Now then, I have news for thee!
Alfonzo, the destroyer, is assembled at
the head of thirty thousand armed
Christians
,
and is preparing to storm the city.
This intelligence may be relied on.'
The Prince, amazed to learn that a
force, which he supposed to consist at
the most, of ten or fifteen hundred men,
was thus menacing him, under a leader
so formidable, at once called all the
citizens
to arms! But in vain to save
Cordova
and his crown.
Abdelasis had no sooner got before the
four gates, in four divisions, than he
sounded his trumpets. In a moment,
sixteen thousand slaves were in arms in
the bosom of the city. Taken by
surprise
,
the Moors were panic-stricken.
The gates were carriedAlfonzo
entered
at the head of ten thousand men, and
swept the city. Abdelasis was taken
prisonor, and El Zegris slain by the hand
of Alfonzo. Zariffa perished by the
hands af the Moorish officers of the
palace
who charged her with having been
the mover of the revolution. The whole
city, with every strong-hold, fell into the
hands of the Christians. Those in the
country followed, and every where the
banner of the cross, prevailed over the
fallen crescent. Spain was made free!
The Moors fled to their ships, or were
made slaves to their conquerors.
Addelasis
was beheaded on the terrace of
his own palace. Alfonzo, with his royal
bride, Genilla, was proclaimed King of
Spain, and the Triumph of Liberty, and
of the Cross over the Crescent, and
Moslem bondage, was complete.
THE END.
