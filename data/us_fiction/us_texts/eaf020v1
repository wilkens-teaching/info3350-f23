CHAP. I.
JOHN FARRAGO, was a man of about
fifty-three years of age, of good natural
sense
, and
considerable
reading; but in
some
things
whimsical
, owing perhaps to
his greater knowledge of books than of the
world; but, in
some
degree,
also
, to his
having never married, being what they call
an old batchelor, a
characteristic
of which
is,
usually
,
singularity
and whim. He had
the advantage of having had in early life,
an academic education; but having never
applied
himself
to any of the learned
professions
,
he had lived the greater part of his
life on a
small
farm, which he cultivated
with
servants
or hired hands, as he could
conveniently
supply
himself
with either.
The
servant
that he had at this time, was
an
Irishman
,
whose
name was Teague
Oregan. I
shall
say
nothing of the
character
of this man,
because
the very name
imports
what he was.
A
strange
idea came into the head of
Captain Farrago about this time; for, by
the bye, I had forgot to mention that
having
being
chosen
captain of a company of
militia in the neighbourhood, he had gone
by the name of Captain ever
since
; for the
rule is, once a captain, and always a
captain
;
but, as I was
observing
, the idea
had come into his head, to
saddle
an old
horse
that he had, and ride about the world
a little, with his man Teague at his heels,
to
see
how things were going on here and
there, and to
observe
human nature. For
it is a
mistake
to
suppose
, that a man
cannot
learn man by reading him in a corner,
as well as on the
widest
space
of
transaction
.
At any rate, it may yield
amusement
.
It was about a
score
of miles from his
own
house
, that he fell in with what we call
Races. The jockeys
seeing
him advance,
with Teague by his
side
, whom they took
for his groom, conceived him to be
some
person
who had brought his
horse
to enter
for the
purse
. Coming up and
accosting
him,
said
they, You
seem
to be for the
races, Sir; and have a
horse
to enter. Not
at all,
said
the captain; this is but a
common
palfrey, and by no means remarkable
for
speed
or bottom; he is a common
plough
horse
which I have
used
on my farm
for
several
years, and can
scarce
go beyond
a trot; much
less
match
himself
with your
blooded
horses
that are going to take the
field on this
occasion
.
The jockeys were of opinion, from the
speech
, that the
horse
was what they call a
bite, and that under the appearance of
leanness
and
stiffness
, there was concealed
some
hidden quality of
swiftness
uncommon
.
For they had heard of
instances
,
where the
most
knowing had been taken
in by mean looking
horses
;
so
that having
laid two, or more, to one, they were
nevertheless
bit by the bet; and the mean
looking nags, proved to be
horses
of a more
than common
speed
and bottom. So that
there is no
trusting
appearances. Such
was the
reasoning
of the jockeys. For they
could have no idea, that a man could come
there in
so
singular
a manner, with a
groom at his foot,
unless
he had
some
great object of making money by the
adventure
.
Under this idea, they began to
interrogate him with
respect
to the blood
and pedigree of his
horse
: whether he
was of the dove, or the bay mare that
took the
purse
; and was imported by
such
a one at
such
a time? whether his
sire
was Tamerlane or Bajazet?
The Captain was irritated at the
questions
,
and could not avoid
answering
.
Gentlemen,
said
he, it is a
strange
thing
that you
should
suppose
that it is of any
consequence
what may be the pedigree of a
horse
. For even in men it is of no avail.
Do we not find that
sages
have had
blockheads
for their
sons
; and that blockheads
have had
sages
? It is remarkable, that as
estates
have
seldom
lasted
three
generations
,
so
understanding
and ability have
seldom
been
transmitted
to the
second
.
There never was a greater man, take him
as an orator and
philosopher
, than Cicero:
and never was there a
person
who had
greater opportunities than his
son
Marcus;
and yet he proved of no account or
reputation
.
This is an old
instance
, but
there are a
thousand
others.
Chesterfield
and his
son
are mentioned. It is true,
Philip and Alexander may be
said
to be
exceptions: Philip of the
strongest
possible
mind; capable of
almost
every thing
we can conceive; the
deepest
policy and
the
most
determined valour; his
son
Alexander
not deficient in the
first
, and before
him in the
last
; if it is
possible
to be
before
a man than whom you can
suppose
nothing greater. It is
possible
, in modern
times, that Tippo Saib may be equal to
his father Hyder Ali. Some talk of the
two Pitts. I have no idea that the
son
is, in
any
respect
, equal to old Sir William. The
one is a laboured artificial
minister
: the
other
spoke
with the thunder, and acted
with the lightning of the gods. I will
venture to
say
, that when the
present
John
Adamses
, and Lees, and
Jeffersons
, and Jays,
and Henrys, and other great men, who
figure
upon the
stage
at this time, have gone
to
sleep
with their fathers, it is an hundred
to one if there is any of their
descendents
who can fill their places. Was I to lay a bet
for a great man, I would
sooner
pick up
the brat of a tinker, than go into the great
houses
to
chuse
a piece of
stuff
for a man
of genius. Even with
respect
to
personal
appearance, which is more in the power
of natural production, we do not
see
that
beauty always produces beauty; but on
the contrary, the
homliest
persons
have
oftentimes the
best
favoured offspring;
so
that there is no rule or
reason
in
these
things. With
respect
to this
horse
,
therefore
,
it can be of no moment whether he is
blooded or
studed
, or what he is. He is a
good old
horse
,
used
to the plough, and
carries
my weight very well; and I have never
yet made enquiry with
respect
to his
ancestors
,
or affronted him
so
much as to
cast
up to him the defect of parentage.
I bought him
some
years ago from Niel
Thomas, who had him from a colt. As
far as I can
understand
, he was of a brown
mare that John M`Neis had; but of what
horse
I know no more than the
horse
himself
.
His gaits are good enough, as to
riding a
short
journey of
seven
or eight
miles, or the like; but he is rather a pacer
than a troter; and though his bottom may
be good enough in carrying a bag to the
mill, or going in the plough, or the
sled
,
or the harrow,
&c.
yet his wind is not
so
good, nor his
speed
, as to be fit for the
heats.
The jockeys thought the man a fool, and
gave
themselves
no more trouble about
him.
The
horses
were now entered, and about
to
start
for the
purse
. There was Black
and all Black, and Snip, John Duncan's
Barbary Slim, and
several
others. The
riders had been weighed, and when
mounted
,
the word was given. It is
needless
to
describe
a race; every body knows the
circumstances
of it. It is
sufficient
to
say
,
that from the bets that were laid, there
was much anxiety, and
some
passion
in
B
the minds of
those
concerned: So, that as
two of the
horses
, Black and all Black,
and Slim, came out near together; there
was
dispute
and
confusion
. It came to
kicking and cuffing in
some
places. The
Captain was a good deal hurt with
such
indecency
amongst
gentlemen, and
advancing
,
addressed
them in the following
manner
:
Gentleman, this is an unequal and
unfair proceeding. It is unbecoming
modern
manners, or even the ancient. For at
the Olympic games of Greece, where were
celebrated
horse
and chariot races, there
was no
such
hurry
scurry
as this; and in
times of chivalry
itself
, where men ate,
drank, and
slept
on
horse
-back, though
there was a great deal of pell-meling, yet no
such
disorderly
work as this. If men had
a difference, they couched their lances,
and ran full tilt at one another; but no
such
indecent
expressions
, as villain,
scoundrel
,
liar, ever came out of their mouths.
There was the
most
perfect
courtesy
in
those
days of
heroism
and honour; and
this your
horse
-racing, which is a germ of
the
amusement
of
those
times, ought to be
conducted on the
same
principles of
decorum
,
and good breeding.
As he was
speaking
, he was
jostled
by
some
one in the croud, and thrown from
his
horse
; and had it not been for Teague,
who was at hand, and helped him on
again
,
he would have
suffered
damage. As
it was, he received a
contusion
in his head,
of which he complained much; and
having
left the race-ground, and coming to a
small
cottage, he
stopped
a little, to alight
and
dress
the wound. An old woman who
was there, thought they ought to take a
little
of his water, and
see
how it was with
him; but the Captain having no faith in
telling
disorders
by the urine, thought
proper to
send
for a
surgeon
who was hard
by, to examine the
bruise
, and apply
bandages
.
The
surgeon
attended, and
examining
the part, pronounced it a
contusion
of the cerebrum. But as there appeared
but little laceration, and no fracture,
simple
or compound, the pia mater could not
be injured; nor even could there be more
than a
slight
impression
on the dura mater.
So that trepaning did not at all appear
necessary
.
A
most
fortunate
circumstance
;
for a wound in the head, is of all places
the
most
dangerous;
because
there can be
no amputation to
save
life. There being but
one head to a man, and that being the
residence
of the five
senses
, it is
impossible
to live without it.
Nevertheless
, as the
present
case
was highly dangerous, as it
might lead to a
subsultus
tendinum, or
lock-jaw, it was
necessary
to apply
cataplasms
,
in order to reduce inflammation,
and bring about a
sanative
disposition
of
the parts. Perhaps it might not be
amiss
,
to take an anodyne as a refrigerant.
Many
patients had been
lost
by the ignorance
of empirics
prescribing
bracers; whereas,
in the
first
stage
of a
contusion
, relaxing
and antifebrile medicines are proper. A
little phlebotomy was no doubt
necessary
,
to prevent the
bursting
of the blood
vessels
.
The Captain hearing
so
many hard
words, and bad accounts of this
case
, was
much alarmed.
Nevertheless
he did not
think it could be
absolutely
so
dangerous.
For it
seemed
to him that he was not
sick
at heart, or under any mortal pain. The
surgeon
observed
, that in this
case
he could
not
himself
be a judge. For the very part
was affected by which he was to judge,
viz.
the head; that it was no uncommon thing
for men in the
extremest
cases
to imagine
themselves
out of danger; whereas in
reality
,
they were in the
greatest
possible
:
that
notwithstanding
the
symptoms
were
mild, yet from the
contusion
, a
mortification
might
ensue
. Hypocrates, who might
be
stiled
an elementary
physician
, and has
a
treatise
on this very
subject
, is of
opinion
,
that the
most
dangerous
symptom
,
is a topical
insensibility
; but among the
moderns, Sydenham
considers
it in
another
point of view, and thinks that where
there is no pain, there is as great
reason
to
suppose
that there is no hurt, as that
there is a mortal one. Be this as it may,
antiseptic
medicines might be very proper.
The Captain hearing
so
much jargon,
and
conscious
to
himself
that he was by
no means in
so
bad a
state
as this
son
of
Escalapius
would
represent
, broke out into
some
passion
. It is,
said
he, the craft of
your
profession
to make the
case
worse
than
it is, in order to
increase
the
perquisites
.
But if there is any faith in you, make the
same
demand, and let me know your real
judgment. The
surgeon
was irritated with
his
distrust
, and took it into his head to
fix
some
apprehension
in the mind of his
patient, if
possible
, that his
case
was not
without danger. Looking
stedfastly
at
him for
some
time, and feeling his
pulse
,
there is,
said
he, an evident delirium
approaching
.
This argues an affection of
the brain, but it will be
necessary
, after
some
soporiferous
draughts, to put the
patient to
sleep
. Said the Captain, If you
will give me about a pint of
whiskey
and
water, I will try to go to
sleep
myself
.
Adeleterious
mixture, in this
case
,
said
the
surgeon
, cannot be proper;
especially
a
distillation
of that quality. The Captain
would hear no more; but
requesting
the
man of the cabin, to let him have the
spirits
proposed
, drank a pint or two of
grog, and having bound up his head with
a handkerchief, went to bed.
CHAP. II.
Containing
some
general Reflections.
THE
first
reflection that
arises
, is, the
good
sense
of the Captain; who was
unwilling to
impose
his
horse
for a racer;
not being qualified for the
course
.
Because
,
as an old lean
beast
, attempting a
trot he was
respectable
enough; but
going
out of his nature, and affecting
speed
,
he would have been contemptible. The
great
secret
of
preserving
respect
, is the
cultivating and
shewing
to the
best
advantage
the powers that we
possess
, and the not
going beyond them. Every thing in its
element
is good, and in their proper
sphere
all
natures and capacities are excellent. This
thought might be turned into a
thousand
different
shapes
, and cloathed with various
expressions
; but after all, it comes to the
old proverb at
last
,
Ne
sutor
ultra crepidam,
Let the cobler
stick
to his
last
; a
sentiment
we are about more to
illustrate
in the
sequel
of this work.
The
second
reflection that
arises
, is, the
simplicity
of the Captain; who was
so
unacquainted
with the world, as to imagine that
jockeys and men of the turf could be
composed
by
reason
and good
sense
; whereas
there are no people who are by education
of a
less
philosophic
turn of mind. The
company of
horses
is by no means
favourable
to good
taste
and genius. The rubbing
and currying them, but little enlarges the
faculties, or improves the mind; and even
riding, by which a man is carried
swiftly
through the air, though it contributes to
health, yet
stores
the mind with few or no
ideas; and as men naturally
consimilate
with their company,
so
it is
observable
that your jockeys are a
class
of people not
greatly removed from the
sagacity
of a
good
horse
. Hence
most
probably the
fable of the centaur, among the ancients;
by which they held out the moral of the
jockey and the
horse
being one
beast
.
A third reflection is, that which he
exprest
;
viz.
the
professional
art of the
surgeon
to make the
most
of the
case
, and the
technical terms
used
by him. I have to
declare, that it is with no attempt at wit,
that the terms are
set
down, or the art of
the
surgeon
hinted at;
because
it is
so
common place a thing to ridicule the
peculiarities
of a
profession
, that it
savours
of
mean parts to indulge it. For a man of
real genius will never walk in the beaten
track,
because
his object is what is new
and uncommon. This
surgeon
does not
appear to have been a man of very great
ability; but the Captain was certainly
wrong in declining his
prescriptions
; for
the maxim is,
Unicuique in arte,
sua
perito,
credendum
est
;
every one is to be
trusted
in his
profession
.
CHAP. III.
THE Captain
rising
early next
morning
,
and
setting
out on his way, had
now arrived at a place where a number of
people were convened, for the
purpose
of
electing
persons
to
represent
them in the
legislature
of the
state
. There was a
weaver
who was a candidate for this
appointment
,
and
seemed
to have a good deal of
interest
among the people. But another,
who was a man of education, was his
competitor
.
Relying on
some
talent of
speaking
which he thought he
possessed
, he
addressed
the multitude.
Said he, Fellow citizens, I pretend not
to any great abilities; but am
conscious
to
myself
that I have the
best
good will to
serve
you. But it is very
astonishing
to
me, that this weaver
should
conceive
himself
qualified for the
trust
. For though my
acquirements are not great, yet his are
still
less
. The mechanical
business
which he
pursues
,
must
necessarily
take up
so
much
of his time, that he cannot apply
himself
to political
studies
. I
should
therefore
think it would be more
answerable
to your
dignity, and conducive to your
interest
,
to be
represented
by a man at
least
of
some
letters, than by an illiterate
handicraftsman
like this. It will be more
honourable
for
himself
, to remain at his
loom and knot threads, than to come
forward
in a
legislative
capacity:
because
, in
the one
case
, he is in the
sphere
where
God and nature has placed him; in the
other, he is like a
fish
out of water, and
must
struggle
for breath in a new element.
Is it
possible
he can
understand
the
affairs
of government,
whose
mind has been
concentered to the
small
object of weaving
webs; to the price by the yard, the
grist
of the thread, and
such
like matters as
concern a manufacturer of cloths? The
feet of him who weaves, are more
occupied
than the head, or at
least
as much;
and therefore the whole man
must
be, at
least
, but in half
accustomed
to
exercise
his mental powers. For
these
reasons
, all
other things
set
aside
, the chance is in my
favour, with
respect
to information.
However
,
you will decide, and give your
suffrages
to him or to me, as you
shall
judge
expedient.
The Captain hearing
these
observations
,
and looking at the weaver, could not help
advancing, and undertaking to
subjoin
something
in
support
of what had been
just
said
. Said he, I have no prejudice
against
a weaver more than another man. Nor do
I know any harm in the trade;
save
that
from the
sedentary
life in a damp place,
there is
usually
a
paleness
of the
countenance
:
but this is a
physical
, not a moral
evil. Such
usually
occupy
subterranean
apartments; not for the
purpose
, like
Demosthenes
, of
shaving
their heads, and
writing over eight times the
history
of
Thucydides, and perfecting a
stile
of
oratory
;
but rather to keep the thread
moist
;
or
because
this is
considered
but as an
inglorious
sort
of trade, and is frequently
thrust
away into cellars, and damp
outhouses
,
which are not occupied for a better
use
.
But to
rise
from the cellar to the
senate
house
, would be an unnatural
hoist
. To
come from counting threads, and
adjusting
them to the
splits
of a reed, to
regulate
the finances of a government, would
be
preposterous
; there being no
congruity
in the
case
. There is no analogy
between
knotting threads and framing laws.
It would be a
reversion
of the order of
things. Not that a manufacturer of linen
or woolen, or other
stuff
, is an inferior
character, but a different one, from that
which ought to be employed in affairs of
state
. It is
unnecessary
to enlarge on this
subject
; for you
must
all be convinced of
the truth and propriety of what I
say
. But
if you will give me leave to take the
manufacturer
aside
a little, I think I can
explain
to him my ideas on the
subject
; and
very probably prevail with him to
withdraw
his
pretensions
. The people
seeming
to
acquiesce
, and beckoning to the
weaver
,
they drew
aside
, and the Captain
addressed
him in the following words:
Mr. Traddle,
said
he, for that was the
name of the manufacturer, I have not the
smallest
idea of wounding your
sensibility
;
but it would
seem
to me, it would be more
your
interest
to
pursue
your occupation,
than to launch out into that of which you
have no knowledge. When you go to
the
senate
house
, the application to you
will not be to warp a web; but to make
laws for the commonwealth. Now,
suppose
that the making
these
laws, requires
a knowledge of commerce, or of the
interests
of agriculture, or
those
principles
upon
C
which the different manufactures
depend
,
what
service
could you render. It
is
possible
you might think
justly
enough;
but could you
speak
? You are not in the
habit of public
speaking
. You are not
furnished
with
those
common place ideas,
with which even very ignorant men can
pass
for knowing
something
. There is
nothing makes a man
so
ridiculous as to
attempt what is above his
sphere
. You
are no tumbler for
instance
; yet
should
you give out that you could vault upon a
man's back; or turn head over heels, like
the wheel of a cart; the
stiffness
of your
joints would encumber you; and you
would fall upon your
backside
to the
ground. Such a
squash
as that would do
you damage. The getting up to ride on
the
state
is an
unsafe
thing to
those
who
are not
accustomed
to
such
horsemanship
.
It is a
disagreeable
thing for a man to be
laughed at, and there is no way of
keeping
ones
self
from it but by avoiding all
affectation
.
While they were thus
discoursing
, a
bustle
had taken place among the croud.
Teague hearing
so
much about elections,
and
serving
the government, took it into
his head, that he could be a
legislator
himself
.
The thing was not
displeasing
to the
people, who
seemed
to favour his
pretensions
;
owing, in
some
degree, to there
being
several
of his countrymen among
the croud; but more
especially
to the
fluctuation
of the popular mind, and a
disposition
to what is new and ignoble. For
though the weaver was not the
most
elevated
object of choice, yet he was
still
preferable
to this tatter-demalion, who was but
a menial
servant
, and had
so
much of what
is called the brogue on his tongue, as to
fall far
short
of an elegant
speaker
.
The Captain coming up, and finding
what was on the carpet, was greatly
chagrined
at not having been able to give the
multitude a better idea of the importance
of a
legislative
trust
; alarmed
also
, from
an
apprehension
of the
loss
of his
servant
.
Under
these
impressions
he
resumed
his
address
to the multitude. Said he, This is
making the matter
still
worse
, gentlemen:
this
servant
of mine is but a bog-trotter;
who can
scarcely
speak
the dialect in which
your laws ought to be written; but
certainly
has never read a
single
treatise
on
any political
subject
; for the truth is, he
cannot read at all. The young people of
the lower
class
, in Ireland, have
seldom
the advantage of a good education;
especially
the
descendants
of the ancient
Irish
,
who have
most
of them a great
assurance
of countenance, but little information, or
literature. This young man,
whose
family
name is Oregan, has been my
servant
for
several
years. And, except a
too great
fondness
for women, which now
and then brings him into
scrapes
, he has
demeaned
himself
in a manner tolerable
enough. But he is totally ignorant of the
great principles of
legislation
; and more
especially
, the particular
interests
of the
government. A free government is a
noble
possession
to a people: and this
freedom
consists
in an equal right to make
laws, and to have the benefit of the laws
when made. Though
doubtless
, in
such
a government, the
lowest
citizen may
become
chief
magistrate
; yet it is
sufficient
to
possess
the right; not
absolutely
necessary
to
exercise
it. Or even if you
should
think proper, now and then, to
shew
your
privilege, and exert, in a
signal
manner,
the democratic prerogative, yet is it not
descending
too low to filch away from me
a hireling, which I cannot well
spare
, to
serve
your
purposes
? You are
surely
carrying
the matter too far, in thinking to
make a
senator
of this
hostler
; to take him
away from an employment to which he
has been bred, and put him to another, to
which he has
served
no
apprenticeship
: to
set
those
hands which have been lately
employed in currying my
horse
, to the
draughting-bills, and preparing
business
for the
house
.
The people were tenacious of their
choice, and
insisted
on giving Teague
their
suffrages
; and by the frown upon
their brows,
seemed
to indicate
resentment
at what had been
said
; as indirectly
charging
them with want of judgment; or
calling
in
question
their privilege to do what
they thought proper. It is a very
strange
thing,
said
one of them, who was a
speaker
for the
rest
, that after having
conquered
Burgoyne and Cornwallis, and got a
government of our own, we cannot put
in it whom we
please
. This young man
may be your
servant
, or another man's
servant
; but if we
chuse
to make him a
delegate, what is that to you. He may
not be yet
skilled
in the matter, but there
is a good day a-coming. We will
impower
him; and it is better to
trust
a
plain man like him, than one of your
C 2
high flyers, that will make laws to
suit
their own
purposes
.
Said the Captain, I had much rather you
would
send
the weaver, though I thought
that improper, than to invade my
household
,
and thus detract from me the very
person
that I have about me to
brush
my boots,
and clean my
spurs
. The prolocutor of
the people gave him to
understand
that
his
surmises
were
useless
, for the people
had determined on the choice, and Teague
they would have for a
representative
.
Finding it
answered
no end to
expostulate
with the multitude, he
requested
to
speak
a word with Teague by
himself
.
Stepping
aside
, he
said
to him,
composing
his voice, and
addressing
him in a
soft
manner
;
Teague, you are quite wrong in this
matter they have put into your head. Do
you know what it is to be a member of a
deliberative body? What qualifications are
necessary
? Do you
understand
any thing
of geography? If a
question
should
be, to
make a law to dig a canal in
some
part of
the
state
, can you
describe
the bearing of
the mountains, and the
course
of the rivers?
Or if commerce is to be
pushed
to
some
new
quarter, by the force of regulations, are you
competent to decide in
such
a
case
? There
will be
questions
of law, and
astronomy
on the carpet. How you
must
gape and
stare
like a fool, when you come to be
asked
your opinion on
these
subjects
? Are
you acquainted with the
abstract
principles
of finance; with the funding public
securities
;
the ways and means of
raising
the
revenue; providing for the
discharge
of
the public debts, and all other things
which
respect
the economy of the
government
?
Even if you had knowledge, have
you a facility of
speaking
. I would
suppose
you would have too much pride to go to
the
house
just
to
say
, Ay, or No. This is
not the fault of your nature, but of your
education; having been
accustomed
to dig
turf in your early years, rather than
instructing
yourself
in the
classics
, or
common
school
books.
When a man becomes a member of a
public
body, he is like a racoon, or other
beast
that climbs up the fork of a tree; the boys
pushing
at him with pitch-forks, or
throwing
stones
, or
shooting
at him with an
arrow
,
the dogs barking in the mean time.
One will find fault with your not
speaking
;
another with your
speaking
, if you
speak
at all. They will have you in the news
papers
,
and ridicule you as a perfect
beast
.
There is what they call the caricatura;
that is,
representing
you with a dog's head,
or a cat's claw. As you have a red head,
they will very probably make a fox of you,
or a
sorrel
horse
, or a brindled cow, or
the like. It is the devil in hell to be
exposed
to the
squibs
and crackers of the
gazette
wits and publications. You know
no more about
these
matters than a
goose
;
and yet you would undertake
rashly
,
without
advice, to enter on the office; nay,
contrary to advice. For I would not for
a
thousand
guineas, though I have not the
half of it to
spare
, that the breed of the
Oregans
should
come to this; bringing on
them a
worse
stain
than
stealing
sheep
; to
which they are addicted. You have
nothing
but your character, Teague, in a
new country to depend upon. Let it never
be
said
, that you quitted an
honest
livelihood
,
the taking care of my
horse
, to
follow
the new fangled whims of the times,
and to be a
statesman
.
Teague was moved chiefly with the
last
part of the
address
, and
consented
to give
up the object.
The Captain, glad of this, took him
back to the people, and announced his
disposition
to decline the honour which
they had intended him.
Teague acknowledged that he had
changed
his mind, and was willing to remain
in a private
station
.
The people did not
seem
well
pleased
with the Captain; but as nothing more
could be
said
about the matter, they
turned
their attention to the weaver, and gave
him their
suffrages
.
CHAP. IV.
CAPTAIN FARRAGO leaving this
place, proceeded on his way; and at
the
distance
of a mile or two, met a man
with a bridle in his hand; who had
lost
a
horse
, and had been at a conjurer's to
make enquiry, and recover his property.
It
struck
the mind of the Captain to go
to this conjuring
person
, and make a
demand
of him, what was the
cause
that the
multitude were
so
disposed
to elevate the
low to the
highest
station
. He had rode
but about a mile, when the habitation of
the conjurer, by the direction and
description
of the man who had
lost
the
horse
had
given, began to be in view. Coming up
to the door, and enquiring if that was not
where conjurer Kolt lived, they were
answered
Yes. Accordingly alighting, and
entering the domicile, all
those
things took
place which
usually
happen, or are
described
in
cases
of this nature,
viz.
there
was the conjurer's
assistant
, who gave the
Captain to
understand
that
master
had
withdrawn a little, but would be in
shortly
.
In the mean time, the
assistant
endeavoured
to draw from him
some
account of
the
occasion
of his journey; which the
other readily communicated; and the
conjurer
,
who was
listening
through a crack
in the partition, overheard. Finding it
was not a
horse
or a cow, or a piece of
linen that was
lost
, but an
abstract
question
of political
philosophy
which was to be put,
he came from his lurking place, and
entered
,
as if not knowing that any
person
had been waiting for him.
After mutual
salutations
, the Captain
gave him to
understand
the object which
he had in view by calling on him.
Said the conjurer, This lies not at all in
my way. If it had been a dozen of
spoons
,
or a
stolen
watch, that you had to look
for, I could very readily, by the
assistance
of my art, have
assisted
you in the
recovery
;
but as to this matter of men's
imaginations
and attachments in political
affairs
,
I have no more
understanding
than
another man.
It is very
strange
,
said
the Captain, that
you who can tell by what means a thing is
stolen
, and the place where it is
deposited
,
though at a
thousand
miles
distance
,
should
know
so
little of what is going on in the
breast
of man, as not to be able to
develope
his
secret
thoughts, and the motives
of his actions.
It is not of our
business
,
said
the other;
but
should
we undertake it, I do not
see
that it would be very difficult to explain
all that puzzles you at
present
. There is
no need of a conjurer to tell why it is that
the common people are more
disposed
to
trust
one of their own
class
, than
those
who may affect to be
superior
.
Besides
,
there is a certain pride in man, which leads
him to elevate the low, and pull down the
high. There is a kind of creating power
exerted in making a
senator
of an
unqualified
person
; which when the author has
done, he exults over the work, and, like
the Creator
himself
when he made the
world,
sees
that it is very good.
Moreover
,
there is in every government a
patrician
class
,
against
whom the
spirit
of the
multitude naturally militates: And hence
a perpetual war; the
aristocrats
endeavouring
to detrude the people, and the
people contending to obtrude
themselves
.
And it is right it
should
be
so
; for by this
fermentation, the
spirit
of democracy is
kept alive.
The Captain, thanking him for his
information
,
asked
him what was to pay;
at the
same
time pulling out half a crown
from a green
silk
purse
which he had in
his breeches pocket. The conjurer gave
him to
understand
, that as the
solution
of
these
difficulties was not within his
province
,
he took nothing for it. The
Captain
expressing
his
sense
of his
disinterested
service
, bade him adieu.
D
CHAP. V.
Containing Reflections.
A Democracy is beyond all
question
the
freest
government:
because
under
this, every man is equally protected by
the laws, and has equally a voice in
making
them. But I do not
say
an equal voice;
because
some
men have
stronger
lungs than
others, and can
express
more forcibly
their opinions of public affairs. Others,
though they may not
speak
very loud, yet
have a faculty of
saying
more in a
short
time; and even in the
case
of others, who
speak
little or none at all, yet what they
do
say
containing good
sense
, comes with
greater weight;
so
that all things
considered
,
every citizen, has not, in this
sense
of
the word, an equal voice. But the right
being equal, what great harm if it is
unequally
exercised
? is it
necessary
that every
man
should
become a
statesman
? No more
than that every man
should
become a poet
or a painter. The
sciences
, are open to all;
but let him only who has
taste
and genius
pursue
them. If any man covets the office
of a
bishop
,
says
St. Paul, he covets a
good work. But again, he adds this
caution
,
Ordain not a novice,
lest
being
lifted
up with pride, he falls into the
condemnation
of the devil. It is indeed making
a devil of a man to lift him up to a
state
to which he is not
suited
. A ditcher is a
respectable
character, with his over-alls on,
and a
spade
in his hand; but put the
same
man to
those
offices which require the
head, whereas he has been
accustomed
to
impress
with his foot, and there appears a
contrast
between the man and the
occupation
.
There are individuals in
society
, who
prefer honour to wealth; or cultivate
political
studies
as a branch of literary
pursuits
;
and offer
themselves
to
serve
public
bodies, in order to have an opportunity of
discovering
their knowledge, and
exercising
their judgment. It
must
be chagrining to
these
, and hurtful to the public, to
see
those
who have no talent this way, and ought
to have no
taste
,
preposterously
obtrude
themselves
upon the government. It is the
same
as if a brick-layer
should
usurp
the
office
of a taylor, and come with his
square
and perpendicular, to take the
measure
of
a pair of breeches.
It is proper that
those
who cultivate
oratory
,
should
go to the
house
of orators. But
for an Ay and No man to be ambitious of
that place, is to
sacrifice
his credit to his
vanity.
I would not mean to
insinuate
that
legislators
are to be
selected
from the more
wealthy of the citizens, yet a man's
circumstances
ought to be
such
as afford him
leisure
for
study
and reflection. There is
often wealth without
taste
or talent. I have
no idea, that
because
a man lives in a great
house
, and has a
cluster
of bricks or
stones
about his
backside
, that he is therefore fit
for a
legislator
. There is
so
much pride
and arrogance with
those
who
consider
themselves
the
first
in a government, that
it
deserves
to be checked by the populace,
and the evil
most
usually
commences on
this
side
. Men
associate
with their own
persons
, the adventitious
circumstances
of
birth and fortune: So that a fellow blowing
with fat and repletion, conceives
himself
superior
to the poor lean man, that lodges
in an inferior
mansion
. But as in all
cases
,
so
in this, there is a medium. Genius and
virtue are independent of rank and
fortune
;
and it is neither the opulent, nor the
indigent, but the man of ability and
integrity
that ought to be called forth to
serve
his country: and while, on the one hand,
the
aristocratic
part of the government,
arrogates a right to
represent
; on the other
hand, the democratic contends the point;
and from this conjunction and
opposition
of forces, there is produced a compound
resolution
, which carries the object in an
intermediate direction. When we
see
therefore, a Teague Oregan lifted up, the
philosopher
will reflect, that it is to balance
some
purse
-proud fellow, equally as
ignorant
,
that comes down from the
sphere
of
the
aristocratic
interest
.
But every man ought to
consider
for
himself
, whether it is his
use
to be this
draw-back, on either
side
. For as when
good liquor is to be
distilled
, you throw
in
some
material
useless
in
itself
to correct
the
effervescence
of the
spirit
;
so
it may be
his part to act as a
sedative
. For though
we commend the effect, yet
still
the
material
retains but its original value.
But as the nature of things is
such
, let
no man, who means well to the
commonwealth
,
and offers to
serve
it, be hurt in
his mind when
some
one of meaner talents
D 2
is preferred. The people are a
sovereign
,
and greatly
despotic
; but, in the main,
just
.
I have a great mind, in order to
elevate
the
composition
, to make quotations
from the Greek and Roman
history
. And
I am
conscious
to
myself
, that I have read
over the writers on the government of
Italy
and Greece, in ancient, as well as
modern times. But I have drawn a great
deal more from reflection on the nature
of things, than from all the writings I
have ever read. Nay, the
history
of the
election, which I have
just
given, will
afford
a better
lesson
to the American mind,
than all that is to be found in other
examples
.
We have
seen
here, a weaver a
favoured candidate, and in the next
instance
,
a bog-trotter
superseding
him. Now
it may be
said
, that this is fiction; but
fiction
,
or no fiction, the nature of the thing
will make it a reality. But I return to the
adventures of the Captain, whom I have
upon my hands; and who, as far as I can
yet
discover
, is a good
honest
man; and
means what is benevolent and
useful
;
though his ideas may not comport with
the ordinary manner of thinking, in every
particular.
BOOK II.
CHAP. I.
THERE was, in a certain great city,
a
society
who called
themselves
Philosophers
.
They had
published
books,
they called
Transactions
.
These
contained
dissertations
on the nature and
causes
of things; from the
stars
of the heaven to
the fire-flies of the earth; and from the
sea
-crab to the woodland buffaloe. Such
disquisitions
, are
doubtless
useful
and
entertaining
to an
inquisitive
mind.
There is no
question
, but there were in
this body
some
very great men;
whose
investigations
of the arcana of nature,
deserve
attention. But
so
it was, there had
been introduced, by
some
means, many
individuals, who were no
philosophers
at
all. This is no
unusual
thing with
institutions
of this nature; though, by the
bye, it is a very great fault. For it
lessens
the incentives of honour, to have the
access
made
so
easy
, that every one may
obtain
admission
. It has been a reproach
to
some
colleges, that a diploma could be
purchased
for half a crown. This
society
were
still
more moderate; for the bare
scratching
the
backside
of a member has
been known to procure a
fellowship
. At
least
, there have been
those
admitted who
appeared capable of nothing
else
.
Nevertheless
, it was
necessary
, even in
these
cases
, for the candidates to procure
some
token of a
philosophical
turn of mind;
such
as the
skin
of a dead cat, or
some
odd kind of a
mouse
-trap, or the like; or
have
some
phrases
in their mouths, about
minerals and petrifactions;
so
as
just
to
support
some
idea of natural knowledge,
and
pass
muster
. There was one who had
got in by finding, accidentally, the tail
of a rabbit, which had been taken off in
a boy's trap. Another by means of a
squirrel
's
scalp
, which he had taken care
to
stretch
and dry on a bit of
osier
,
bended
in the form of a hoop. The beard of
an old fox, taken off and dried in the
sun
,
was the means of introducing one whom
I knew very well: Or rather, as I have
already hinted, it was beforehand
intended
he
should
be introduced; and
these
exuvi, or
spoils
of the animal kingdom,
were but the tokens and apologies for
admission
.
It happened, as the Captain was riding
this day, and Teague trotting after him, he
saw
a large owl, that had been
shot
by
some
body, and was placed in the crotch of a tree,
about the height of a man's head from the
ground, for
those
that
passed
by to look
at. The Captain being
struck
with it, as
somewhat
larger than
such
birds
usually
are,
desired
Teague to reach it to him;
and tying it to the hinder part of his
saddle
,
rode along.
Passing
by the
house
of one who
belonged
to the
society
, the bird was noticed at
the
saddle
-
skirts
, and the
philosopher
coming
out, made enquiry of the genus and
nature of the fowl. Said the Captain, I
know nothing more about it, than that it
is nearly as long as a turkey buzzard. It
is
doubtless
,
said
the other, the great
Canada
owl, that comes from the Lakes; and
if your honour will give me leave, I will
take it and
submit
it to the
society
, and
have
yourself
made a member. As to the
first
, the Captain
consented
; but as to the
last
, the being a member, he
chose
rather
to decline it; conceiving
himself
unqualified
for a place in
such
a body. The other
assured
him that he was under a very great
mistake
; for there were
persons
there who
scarcely
knew a B from a bull's foot. That
may be,
said
the Captain; but if others
chuse
to degrade
themselves
, by
suffering
their names to be
used
in
so
preposterous
a way as that, it was no
reason
he
should
.
The other gave him to
understand
, that
the
society
would certainly
wish
to
express
their
sense
of his merit, and
shew
themselves
not inattentive to a
virtuoso
; that
as he declined the honour
himself
, he
probably
might not be
averse
to let his
servant
take a
seat
among them.
Said the Captain, He is but a
simple
Irishman
, and of a low education; his
language being that
spoken
by the
aborigines
of his country. And if he
speaks
a little
English
, it is with the brogue on
his tongue; which would be unbecoming
in a member of your body. It would
seem
to me, that a
philosopher
ought to know
how to write, or at
least
to read. But
Teague can neither write nor read. He
can
sing
a
song
, or
whistle
an
Irish
tune;
but is totally illiterate in all things
else
.
I
question
much if he could tell you how
many new moons there are in the year;
or any the
most
common thing that you
could
ask
him. He is a long-legged
fellow
,
it is true; and might be of
service
in
clambering over rocks, or going to the
shores
of rivers, to gather
curiosities
. But
could you not get
persons
to do this,
without
making them members? I have more
respect
for
science
, than to
suffer
this
bog-trotter
to be
so
advanced at its expence.
In
these
American
states
, there is a wide
field for
philosophic
search
; and
these
researches
may be of great
use
in
agriculture
,
mechanics, and
astronomy
. There
is but little immediate profit attending
these
pursuits
; but if there can be
inducements
of honour,
these
may
supply
the
place. What more alluring to a young
man, than the
prospect
of being, one day,
received into a
society
of men truly
learned
;
the
admission
being a
test
and a proof
of
distinguished
knowledge. But the
fountain
of honour, thus contaminated by a
sediment
foreign from its nature, who
would
wish
to drink of it?
Said the
philosopher
, At the
first
institution
of the
society
by Dr. Franklin and
others, it was put upon a narrow
basis
,
and only men of
science
were
considered
proper to
compose
it; and this might be a
necessary
policy at that time, when the
institution
was in its infancy, and could not
bear much draw-back of ignorance. But
it has not been judged
so
necessary
of late
years. The matter
stands
now on a broad
and catholic bottom; and, like the
gospel
itself
, it is our orders to go out into the
high-ways and hedges, and compel them
to come in. There are hundreds,
whose
names you may
see
on our
list
, who are
not more
instructed
than this lad of yours.
They
must
be a
sad
set
indeed then,
said
the Captain. Sad or no
sad
,
said
the other,
it is the
case
; and if you will let Teague
go, I will engage him a
membership
.
I take it very ill of you, Mr.
Philosopher
,
said
the Captain, to put this
nonsense
in his head. If you knew what trouble I
have lately had with a parcel of people
that were for
sending
him to
Congress
, you
would be unwilling to draw him from me
for the
purpose
of making him a
philosopher
.
It is not an
easy
matter to get
hirelings
now-a-days; and when you do get
one, it is a mere chance, whether he is
faithful, and will
suit
your
purpose
. It
would be a very great
loss
to me, to have
him taken off at this time, when I have
equipped
myself
for a journey.
Teague was a good deal
incensed
at this
refusal
of his
master
, and
insisted
that he
would be a
philosopher
. You are an
ignoramus
,
said
the Captain. It is not the
being among
philosophers
will make you
one.
Teague
insisted
that he had a right to
make the
best
of his fortune: and as there
was a door open to his advancement, he
did not
see
why he might not make
use
of it.
The Captain finding that it
answered
no
end to
dispute
the matter with him, by
words of
sense
and
reason
, took a
contrary
way to manage him.
Teague,
said
he, I have a regard for
you, and would
wish
to
see
you do well.
But before you take this
step
, I would
wish
to
speak
a word or two in private. If
you will go, I may perhaps
suggest
some
things that may be of
service
to you, for
your future conduct in that body.
Teague
consenting
, they
stepped
aside
;
and the Captain
addressed
him in the
following
manner:
E
Teague,
said
he, do you know what you
are about? It is a fine thing, at
first
sight
,
to be a
philosopher
, and get into this
body
.
And indeed, if you are a real
philosopher
,
it might be
some
honour, and
also
safe
, to take that leap. But do you think
it is to make a
philosopher
of you that
they want you? Far from it. It is their
great
study
to find
curiosities
; and
because
this man
saw
you coming after
me, with a red head, trotting like an
Esquimaux
Indian, it has
struck
his mind
to pick you up, and
pass
you for one.
Nay, it is
possible
, they may intend
worse
;
and when they have examined you awhile,
take the
skin
off you, and
pass
you for an
over-grown otter, or a
musk
-rat; or
some
outlandish
animal, for which they will,
themselves
, invent a name. If you were
at the
museum
of one of
these
societies
, to
observe
the quantity of
skins
and
skeletons
they have, you might be well
assured
they
did not come by them
honestly
. I know
so
much of
these
people, that I am well
persuaded
they would think no more of
throwing you into a kettle of boiling
water
,
than they would a tarapin; and
having
scraped
you out to a
shell
,
present
you
as the relics of an animal they had
procured
,
at an
immense
price, from
some
Guinea merchant. Or if they
should
not
at once turn you to this
use
, how, in the
mean time, will they
dispose
of you?
They will have you away through the
bogs and
marshes
, catching flies and
miresnipes
;
or
send
you to the woods for a
polecat
;
or oblige you to
descend
into
drawwells
for fog, and
phlogistic
air, and the
Lord knows what. You
must
go into
wolves dens, and catch bears by the tail;
run over mountains like an
opossum
, and
dig the earth like a ground hog. You
will have to climb upon trees, and get
yourself
bit by flying
squirrels
. There will
be no end to the
musketoes
you will have
to
dissect
. What is all this to diving into
mill-dams and rivers, to get craw-
fish
. Or
if you go to the ocean, there are
alligators
to devour you like a cat-
fish
. Who
knows but it may come your turn, in a
windy night, to go aloft to the heavens,
to rub down the
stars
, and give the goats
and rams, that are there, fodder. The
keeping the
stars
clean, is a laborious
work; a great deal
worse
than
scouring
andirons, or
brass
kettles. There is a
bull there would think no more of
tossing
you on his horns than he would a puppy
dog. If the crab
should
get you in his
claws he would
squeeze
you like a
lobster
.
But what is all that to your having no
place to
stand
on? How would you like
to be up at the moon, and to fall down
when you had
missed
your hold, like a
boy from the top-
mast
of a
ship
, and have
your brains beat out upon the top of
some
great mountain; where the devil might
take your
skeleton
and give it to the
turkey-buzzards
?
Or if they
should
, in the mean time,
excuse
from
such
out of door
services
, they
will rack and torture you with hard
questions
.
You
must
tell them how long the
rays of light are coming from the
sun
;
how many drops of rain fall in a thunder
gust
; what makes the
grasshopper
chirp
when the
sun
is hot; how
muscle
shells
get up to the top of the mountains; how
the Indians got over to America. You
will have to prove
absolutely
that the
negroes
were once white; and that their
flat
noses
came by
some
cause
in the
compass
of human means to produce.
These
are puzzling
questions
; and yet you
must
solve
them all. Take my advice, and
stay
where you are. Many men have ruined
themselves
by their ambition, and made
bad
worse
. There is another kind of
philosophy
, which lies more within your
sphere
; that is moral
philosophy
. Every
hostler
or hireling can
study
this, and
you have the
most
excellent opportunity
of acquiring this knowledge in our
traverses
through the country; or
communications
at the different taverns or
villages
,
where we may happen to
sojourn
.
Teague had long ago given up all
thoughts of
philosophy
, and would not
for the world have any more to do with
it; and therefore, without bidding the
philosopher
adieu, they
pursued
their route
as
usual
.
E 2
CHAP. II.
Containing
Observations
.
THE
institution
of the American
Philosophical
Society, does great honour
to the founders; and what has been
published
by that body, comes not behind what
has appeared from
societies
of the
same
nature
elsewhere
. But of late years, it
has
ceased
to be
presumptive
evidence,
at
least
what the lawyers call violent
presumption
,
of
philosophical
attainments, to
be a member; owing to the
spurious
brood
of illiterate
persons
that have been admitted
indiscriminately
with the informed; this
again, owing to a political
dispute
in the
government where this
society
exists
. For
when there are parties in a commonwealth,
they naturally
subdivide
themselves
, and
are found even in the retreats of the
muses
.
It has become the
question
with this
society
,
not whether a man is a
philosopher
or
not, but what part he had taken in
some
question
on the carpet. The body
conceived
itself
to pay a compliment to the
person
admitted, as if it could be any honour to
a man to be announced what he is not. The
contrary is the
case
here. For as honour
is the acknowledgement which the world
makes of a man's
respectability
, there can
be no honour here; for it has become a
mere matter of moon-
shine
to be a
member
.
To be or not be, that is the
question
;
but
so
trifling, that it is
scarcely
ever made.
The way to remedy this, would be to have
an over hauling of the
house
, and derange
at
least
three parts in four. As in the
case
of Tarquin, and the three remaining books
of the Sybiles, you would receive as much
for the fourth part of that body,
should
you
set
them up at market, as for the
whole at
present
.
I have often reflected with
myself
, what
an honour it
must
be, to be one of the
society
of the French academy; forty, of
twenty-four millions of people, are there
selected
in
consequence
of literary
characters
already
established
.
I recollect the time when I had high
ideas
of
philosophical
membership
in
America
.
But it does not appear to me now to
be the
highest
thing that a man could
wish
,
since
even a common Teague Oregan,
trotting on the high way, has been
solicited
to take a
seat
. It may be
said
, that this is
an exaggeration of the facts; and can be
considered
only as
burlesque
. I
profess
it
is not intended as
such
, but as a fair
picture
of what has taken place. Should it
be
considered
in the light of
burlesque
, it
must
be a very lame one;
because
where
there is no
excess
there can be no
caricatura
.
But omitting all apologies and
explanations
,
let the matter
rest
where it is.
BOOK III.
CHAP. I.
IT was
somewhat
late when the Captain
arrived at an inn this evening. There
was there before him, a young
clergyman
,
who had been preaching that day in
a neighbouring congregation; but had not
as
usual
, gone home with an elder; but
had come thus far on his way towards
another
place, where he was to preach the
next day.
The Captain entering into
conversation
with the clergyman,
sat
up pretty late.
The
subject
was what might be expected;
viz.
the affairs of religion and the church.
The clergyman was a good young man;
but inclining to
fanaticism
, and being
righteous
over much: The Captain on the
other
hand,
somewhat
sceptical
in his
notions
of religion: Hence, a
considerable
opposition
of
sentiment
between the two.
But at length,
drowziness
seizing
both,
candles were called for, and they went to
bed.
It was about an hour or two after, when
an uproar was heard in a
small
chamber to
the left of the
stair
-
case
which led to the
floor on which they
slept
. It was Teague,
who had got to bed to the girl of the
house
. For as they would neither let him
go to
Congress
, nor be a
philosopher
, he
must
be doing
something
. The girl not
being apprized, or not
chusing
his
embraces
,
made a great outcry and
lamentation
.
The clergyman, who
slept
in an
adjoining
chamber, and hearing this, out of
the zeal of his benevolence and humanity,
leaped out of bed in his
shirt
, and ran in
to
see
what was the
cause
of the
disturbance
.
The Captain
also
jumping up,
followed
soon
after, and was
scarcely
in the
chamber before the landlord coming up
with a candle, found them all together.
The maid gave this account of the
matter
,
viz.
That between
sleeping
and
waking
she
felt a man's hand lifting up the
bed-clothes; upon which
she
shouted
out
murder. But whether it was any body
there
present
, or
some
one
else
,
she
could
not tell.
Teague,
whose
natural parts were not
bad, and
presence
of mind
considerable
,
instantly
took the
resolution
to throw the
matter on the clergyman. By
shaint
Patrick
,
said
he, I was
aslape
in my own bed
as
sound
as the
shates
that were about me,
when I heard the
sound
of this young
crature's voice crying out like a
shape
in
a
pasture
; and when after I had heard,
aslape
as I was, and come here, I found
this
praste
, who was
so
wholy, and
praching
all night, upon the top of the bed,
with his arms round this young crature's
neck; and if I had not given him a twitch
by the
nose
, and bid him ly over, dear
honey, he would have
ravished
her
virginity
,
and murdered her,
save
her
soul
,
and the paple of the
house
not the
wiser
for it.
The clergyman
stared
with his mouth
open; for the palpable nature of the
falshood
,
had
shocked
him beyond the power
of
speech
.
But the landlady, who in the mean time
was come up, and had heard what Teague
had
said
, was enraged, could
supply
speech
for them both. Hey,
said
she
, this comes
of your preaching and praying, Mr.
Minister
.
I have lodged many a gentleman; but
have never had
such
doings here before. It
is a pretty
story
that a
minister
of the
gospel
should
be the
first
to bring a
scandal
upon the
house
.
The Captain interrupted her, and told
her there was no harm done. The maid
was not actually
ravished
; and if there
was no
noise
made about it, all matters
might be
set
right.
The clergyman had by this time
recovered
himself
so
much as to have the
use
of
his tongue; and began by
protesting
his
innocence
,
and that it was no more him that
made the attack upon the maid, than the
angel Gabriel.
The Captain, interrupting him, and
wishing
to
save
his feelings, began by
excusing
or extenuating the offence. It is
no great affair,
said
he, after all that is
said
or done. The love of women is a
natural
sin
, and the
holiest
men in all ages
have been
propense
to this indulgence.
There was Abraham that got to bed to his
maid Hagar, and had a
bastard
by her,
whom he named
Ishmael
.
Joshua
, who
took Jericho by the
sound
of ram's horns,
saved
a likely
slut
of the name of Rahab,
under a pretence that
she
had been civil to
the
spies
he had
sent
out, but in reality
because
he
himself
took a fancy for her. I
need
say
nothing about David, who wrote
the
Psalms
, and
set
them to
music
; and
yet in his old days had a girl to
sleep
with
him. Human nature is human nature
still
;
and it is not all the preaching and praying
on earth can
extinguish
it.
The clergyman averred his innocence,
and that it was that red-headed gentleman
himself
, meaning Teague, who was in the
room
first
, and had been guilty of the
outrage
.
Teague was beginning to make the
sign
of the
cross
, and to put
himself
into
an attitude of
swearing
, when the Captain
thinking it of no
consequence
who was the
person
, put an end to the matter, by
ordering
Teague to bed, and
himself
bidding
the company good night.
The clergyman finding no better could
be made of it, took the advice of the
landlord
,
and retired
also
. The landlady
seemed
disposed
to
hush
the matter up, and the
maid went to
sleep
as
usual
.
F
CHAP. II.
IT is not the nature of the female tongue
to be
silent
. The landlady could not
avoid informing her
gossips
, and even
some
of her
guests
, of what had happened the
preceding evening in her
house
. The
report
,
so
unfavourable to the clergyman,
had therefore got out; and coming to the
ears of the
consistory
, was the
occasion
of
calling him before them, to
answer
to the
accusation
. The clergyman much
alarmed
,
though
conscious
of innocence,
bethought
himself
of applying to the
Captain
,
to extort from his waiting man a
confession
of the truth, and relieve his
character. Accordingly having
set
out on
a bay
horse
that he had, he found the
Captain, and
addressed
him in the
following
manner:
Captain,
said
he, the affair of that night
at the tavern, is like to be of
serious
consequence
to me. For though I am
innocent
as the child unborn, yet the
presumption
is
against
me, and I am likely to fall
under church
censure
. It may be
sport
to you, but it is a matter of moment to
me. Now, as
sure
as God is in heaven,
I am innocent; and it
must
have been the
devil, or that red headed
Irishman
of
yours, that made the
disturbance
.
The Captain gave him the comfort of
assuring
him that he might make
himself
easy
; for be the matter as it might, he
would take care that Teague
should
assume
it, and bear the blame. The
clergyman
politely thanked him; declaring,
at the
same
time, that he would not
forget
him in his prayers, Sunday or
Saturday
,
while he had an hour to live. The
Captain, not
so
much from any
mercenary
motive of benefit, by his
spiritual
solicitations
, as from a real love of
humanity
and
justice
, had determined to do him
essential
service
in this affair.
Accordingly
,
when the clergyman had retired,
calling
Teague before him, he began in this
manner: Teague,
said
he, from what I
know of your
disposition
, I have no more
doubt than I have of my
existence
, that
it was
yourself
who made that uproar with
the girl at the tavern where we lodged;
though I could not but give you credit
for your
presence
of mind in throwing it
upon the clergyman. But whether the
matter lies with you or him, is of no
consequence
. You can take it upon you,
and lay up
treasure
in heaven. It will be
doing a good work; and
these
people, you
may be
assured
, have a
considerable
influence
in the other world. This clergyman
can
speak
a good word for you when you
come there, and let you into half the
benefit
of all the prayers he has
said
on earth.
It will be no harm to you, for your
character
in this
respect
is as bad as it can well
be.
Teague
said
he did not care much; but
thought the
priest
ought to pay a little
smart
money; for it was a
thankless
matter
to do
these
things for nothing. Said
the Captain,
these
people are not the
most
plenty of money; but I will advance half
a crown towards the accommodation.
Teague was
satisfied
, and ready to
acknowledge
whatever was demanded of him.
Accordingly having come before the
presbytery
on the day appointed for the
trial. Teague made
confession
of the truth;
viz.
That being in the kitchen with the
girl, and
observing
her to be a good
looking
hussy
But
suppose
we give the
speech
in his
own dialect.
Master
prastes
,
said
he, I
persave
you are all
prastes
of the
gosple
,
and can prach as
asily
as I can take a chaw
of tobacco. Now the trut of de
story
is
dis; I was
slaping
in my bed, and I tought
vid
myself
it was a
shame
amonst
christian
paple that a young crature
should
slape
by
herself
, and have no one to take care of
her. So I tought vid
myself
, to go and
slape
vid her. But as
she
was
aslape
,
she
made exclamation, and dis
praste
that is
here before you, came in to
save
her
shoul
from the devil; and as the captain my
master
,
might take offence, and the devil, I
am
shartain
that it was no better
person
,
put it into my head, to lay it on the
praste
This is the trut
master
prastes
, as I hope
for
shalvation
in the kingdom of
purgatory
,
shentlemen
.
On this
confession
, the clergyman was
absolved
, to the great joy of the
presbytery
,
who
considered
it as a particular
providence
that the truth was brought to light.
F 2
CHAP. III.
Containing Reflections.
IT
must
appear from the incident at the
public
house
, with what caution
presumptive
testimony
is to be admitted. Our
criminal law admits it, but lays it down
as a rule, that it be admitted with caution.
There is what is called violent
presumption
;
that is, where
such
circumstances
exist
, as
usually
attend the fact.
Presumptive
proof of this nature is held
sufficient
to convict. I doubt much, whether
reason
or experience approve the doctrine.
Reason
tells us, that there may be all the
circumstances
that
usually
attend the fact,
and yet without the fact
itself
.
Experience
evinces that it has been the
case
; for
we have heard of
persons
convicted of a
capital offence; and yet with their
last
breath
asserting
innocence. Nay, in the
case
of
some
who have been convicted of
homicide, the
persons
who have been
supposed
to have been murdered, have
afterwards
been found alive.
But on
abstract
principles, a
conclusion
of certainty cannot be drawn from
presumptive
proof.
Because
in
cases
of the
most
violent
presumption
, there is
still
a
possibility
of innocence; and where there
is a
possibility
, there
must
be a doubt; and
will you hang man, woman, or child, where
there is a doubt.
In all
cases
there ought to be complete
proof;
because
the convicted
person
is to
be completely
punished
; and the jury,
previous
to this,
must
make complete oath of
the guilt.
It is the ground of the doctrine of
presumptive
proof, that where you cannot
help
suspecting
, you ought to be
positive
;
whereas the
just
conclusion
would be, that
where you cannot help
suspecting
, there
you ought to
suspect
still
, but no more.
It would be a curious
question
in
arithmetic
how many uncertainties make a
certainty
?
In mathematics, the three
angles
of a triangle, are equal to a right
angle
.
But
these
are all angles, that are put
together; that is, they are things of the
same
kind, but the
greatest
angle, and the
longest
side
will never make a triangle,
because
there is no
inclusion
of
space
. There
must
be a number of things of the
same
kind to make an aggregate whole;
so
that
ten
thousand
possibilities
, probabilities, and
violent
presumptions
, can never
constitute
a certainty.
Presumptive
proof is of the nature of
the
semi
plena probatio
of the Roman law;
going but half-way towards proof, it can
never amount to proof at all. For, as the
saying
is, a
miss
is as good as a mile. I
would, therefore, recommend to all jurors,
to take care that
unless
the
witnesses
swear
positively
to the fact, they do not find a
verdict, guilty;
because
, as the current
cannot
rise
higher than the
source
,
so
the
verdict of the juror ought not to be more
absolute
than the oath of the
witness
. In
all
cases
, therefore,
short
of
positive
testimony
,
acquit.
These
hints may
also
be of
service
to
young attornies, and weak judges;
so
that
honest
people may not
lose
their lives, or
be rendered infamous, without full proof
of the offence. It is hard enough to
suffer
when there is full proof; but to be in
the power of a juror's or a judge's
imagination
,
comparing and
construing
circumstances
,
and weighing
possibilities
,
contingencies
,
caprice, wheel, or whim of the brain may
suggest
, is
inconsistent
with that fair trial
which, in a free government, ought to be
enjoyed. Was I a judge or juror, no
one would I condemn without
positive
testimony
of the fact. For it would not be
in my power to
restore
that fame or life
which I took away from the innocent.
And if a guilty
person
should
escape
, it
was none of my look out; but the
business
of Providence to
furnish
proof, if it
was intended that man
should
punish
; and if
proof is not
furnished
, let Providence take
the matter on
himself
, and
punish
the
culprit
either in this life or in a future
state
.
Invisible
things belong to the
Omniscient
;
and it would
seem
great arrogance in man
to take upon him to decide in
cases
of
uncertainty
.
I hope, therefore, yet to
see
the
doctrine of
presumptive
proof, in criminal
cases
, wholly, in courts of
justice
,
discountenanced
.
I can declare, that in the
course
of my experience at the bar, I have
bad one hung, and
several
others within
an ace of it, who were innocent; and
this on the doctrine of
presumption
and
probability. The one that was hung was
a tory
case
, where the popular clamour
was
against
the man; and light
presumption
became violent, under
such
a charge.
I
shall
say
no more on this
subject
;
because
it
seems
to me that I have been
affecting
to
speak
sense
, whereas my
business
is to
speak
nonsense
; this being the
only way to keep out of the reach of
criticism
;
because
critics can
say
no more
than you
yourself
allow;
so
that a charge
of
nonsense
cannot hurt. It is thus that
persons
who have a long
nose
, or
disproportion
of
some
other feature, take the
laugh upon
themselves
first
, and
so
escape
ridicule. The truth is, I will not give
myself
the trouble to write
sense
long. For
I would as
soon
please
fools as
wise
men;
because
the fools are the
most
numerous,
and every prudent man will go with the
majority. I
shall
return to the adventures
of the Captain.
CHAP. IV.
THE
Presbytery
sat
a day or two at
this place, on church affairs, and the
Captain delaying with them, lodged at the
same
house
. Teague, in the mean time,
having an opportunity of ingratiating
himself
with the clergymen, by rubing down
their
horses
, and other menial
services
.
For it is the national character of the
aboriginal
Irish
, to give fair words; and
Teague was not deficient in this
address
.
What with
master
Prasting
, and giving a
great deal of what is called Blarney, he
insinuated
himself
into their good graces;
and by affecting, now and then, to be
seen
at prayers by
himself
, and to have a
sorrowful
countenance, he induced them to
believe that he was in the
first
stage
of
conviction
,
and likely to become a pious man.
Having made this
progress
in their good
opinion, he ventured to
suggest
what was
the ultimate object of his ambition;
viz.
the being a candidate for holy orders. The
Presbytery
, to whom the matter was
represented
by the individuals more
particularly
acquainted with him, thought
favourably
of the
proposition
. For though his
common attainments might not be great,
yet if the grace of God had wrought upon
him, he might become a valuable man.
The Captain having got a hint of this,
took the
first
opportunity of
addressing
the
Presbytery
. Gentlemen,
said
he, you are
deceived in this ragamuffin. For,
notwithstanding
all the
pretensions
he may lately
have to religion, you may be well
assured
that it is all
hypocrisy
, and that he has no
more religion than my
horse
.
The
Presbytery
suspecting
the Captain
to be a carnal man, and
regardless
of the
ministry
, gave little heed to what he
said
,
and
seemed
disposed
to take Teague upon
trials.
The Captain finding the
case
to
stand
thus, and that in
spite
of all he could do,
he was likely to
lose
his
servant
, took his
usual
method of
addressing
the hopes and
fears of Teague
himself
.
Taking him
aside
, he began, with all
possible
art, to
impress
such
fears and
apprehensions
,
as the nature of the
case
suggested
.
Teague,
said
he, do you know
what you are about? You have got into
your vagaries once more. You want to
preach, do you? Are you
apprised
of the
difficulty of this work? The
first
thing you
will have to do, is to take a text; and
when that is done, you have to
split
it into
parts. There are what are called heads;
and
these
you
must
divide into
firstlys
,
and
secondlys
, and thirdlys, and fourthlys,
and
so
on, till you come to twentiethlys,
perhaps. Are you
furnished
with a
concordance
?
or do you know what a
concordance
is? Can you find a text to
suit
your
purpose
when you want it? Can you
explain the
scriptures
; the meaning of
Daniel's ram and the he-goat, or the
seven
trumpets in the Revelations? You are
mistaken
if you think your
Irish
will
pass
for Hebrew.
You think it a great honour to preach
now-a days. It was an honour once; but
the thing is now become
so
common, that
it is of little
consequence
to preach or not.
But do you know how it will behove
you to conduct
yourself
, if you take this
office
upon you. You will have to
compose
the
muscles
of your face to greater
seriousness
than your
disposition
can afford. You
must
quit whoring. How will you like
that, Teague. It would look very ill after
G
sermon
to be catched in bed with a girl at
a tavern.
But do you know why
these
men are
so
anxious to have you of their
mess
? The
truth of the matter is, they carry on a war
with the devil, and they
wish
to recruit you
for the
service
. Do they give you any
bounty-money. Take my word, there
will be but little of this going. Take my
advice then, and let them
settle
their own
quarrels. It is a
silly
thing to be drawn
into
a party, when there is but little to be
got by it: Nay,
worse
than little: For it
will be all on the other
side
. Think you
the devil will forget the
mischief
you do
him in this world, and not
resent
it when
he comes
across
you in a future
state
?
When you are preaching and praying, do
you think he will not hear all that you
throw out
against
him. You may rely
upon it, there will be enough to give him
information; and as a
story
never
loses
in
the telling, it is ten to one they will make
the matter
worse
than it was. Take my
advice, therefore, and make no enemies
while you can help it. Steer through life
as
smoothly
as
possible
. Keep a good
tongue in your mouth, and let
those
who
chuse
to
dispute
with Belzebub,
dispute
. I
never knew any good come of broils and
quarrels,
especially
with low characters.
And, to
say
the truth of it, this Satan,
as they call him, is very little of the
gentleman
.
Even where he is well
disposed
,
he will do but little good to one; but a
most
dangerous creature where he takes a
dislike
. When you go to hell, as, one
day, you
must
, you can expect but little
quarter, after
abusing
him in this world.
He will make you
squeel
like a pig; take
you by the throat, and kick you like a
cat. His very
scullions
will
piss
upon you,
and give you no better life than a dog
among
their feet; while
these
very
clergymen
,
that put you forward to blackguard
for them, will
stand
by laughing in their
sleeves
that you could be
such
a fool.
The
representation
had the
desired
effect
upon Teague, and he thought no
more of the matter.
CHAP. V.
The
Conclusion
, with
Observations
.
THE overtures made by Teague, to be
admitted to the
ministry
, and the
simplicity
of the
ecclesiastics
in
listening
to his
pretensions
, made a great
noise
through
the neighbourhood; in as much as the
young man laboured under a want of
education
,
and was not qualified by
theological
reading. But I do not
see
, why it
should
be thought blamable; provided the matter
was not too much hurried and
hastily
brought forward. For give him a little
time, and he might have been
instructed
to
preach as well as
some
that I
myself
have
heard.
Especially
if at
first
setting
out,
he had confined
himself
to
historical
passages
of
scripture
;
such
as the
history
of
Sampson
, and Gideon, and Barak, and the
like: Only he
must
have taken care that
in pronouncing Barak, with the brogue
upon his tongue, he did not make it Burke;
for that is a patronimic name of his
country
,
and he might inadvertently have
fallen
into this pronunciation.
I acknowledge, that in the regular
churches,
such
as that of the
Presbyterians
,
there is
still
kept up
some
opinion of
the
necessity
of literature. But do we not
see
that with other denominations;
such
as the Quakers, the
Methodists
, and
Anabaptists
,
it is totally
disregarded
and thrown
out?
Because
when human gifts or
acquirements
are
absent
, that which is
supernatural
more evidently appears.
Do not Quakers, and
Methodists
, and
Baptists
, preach very well? At any rate,
they do a great deal of good, and that is the
first
object of preaching. Whether
such
sermonists
, avail
themselves
most
of
sense
or
sound
, I will not
say
; but
so
it is they do
good; and that without the aid of any
human
learning whatever.
It is very true, that formerly in the
infancy
of the church, a knowledge of
languages
and
sciences
, might be
requisite
.
But the
case
is quite altered now. The
Scripture has been well explained, and
frequently preached over; every text and
context examined, and
passages
illustrated
.
The Hebrew roots,
so
to
speak
, have been
all dug up; and there is
scarcely
a new
G 2
etymology to be made. Are there any new
doctrines to
discover
? I
should
think it
impossible
.
At any rate, I
should
conceive
it
unnecessary
. There are enough in all
conscience
: The inventing more, would
be like bringing timber to a wood, or
coals to
Newcastle
.
This being the
case
, I feel
myself
disposed
to agree with
those
who reject
human
learning in religious matters
altogether
.
More
especially
as
science
is really
not the
fashion
at the
present
time. For
as has been before
seen
, even in the very
province of
science
itself
, it is
dispensed
with; that of natural
philosophy
, for
instance
.
In
state
affairs, ignorance does
very well, and why not in church? I am
for having all things of a piece; ignorant
statesmen
, ignorant
philosophers
, and
ignorant
ecclesiastics
. On this principle,
Teague might have done very well as a
preacher. But the
selfishness
of the
Captain
prevailed, and
obstructed
his
advancement
.
BOOK IV.
CHAP. I.
Containing preliminary
Observations
.
I AM very happy in the
composition
of
this work; for though but of a trifling
nature as to
sentiment
; yet, in what I do
write, no one can attribute to me the
least
tincture of
satire
, or ridicule of individuals
or public bodies. This is what I very much
dislike
in others, and would be far from
indulging in
myself
. I acknowledge,
indeed
,
that in my earlier years, and in the
course
of my academical
studies
, I had
contracted
some
taste
, and even habit, this
way; owing to my reading the dialogues
of Lucian, in the original Greek. Had I
read them in a
translation
, they might have
made
less
impression
. But by means of a
difficult language,
studying
them
slowly
,
the turn of thought became more deeply
impressed
upon my mind. Moreover,
afterwards
,
when I came to have
some
acquaintance
with the modern wits,
such
as
Cervantes, Le Sage, and
especially
Swift,
I found
myself
still
more inclined to an
ironical
,
ludicrous way of thinking and
writing
.
But finding the bad effects of this,
in many
respects
, leading me into broils
with individuals, and rendering me
obnoxious
to public bodies, I
saw
the
indiscretion
,
and bad policy of
such
indulgence;
and have for
several
years
past
, carefully
avoided every thing of this kind. It is
indeed
acting but a poor part in life, to make
a
business
of laughing at the follies of
others
.
It is injurious to one's
self
; for there
is a great deal more to be gained by
soothing
and
praising
what men do, than by
finding fault with them. It may be
said
of
satire
, what was
said
of anger by
some
philosopher
, It never pays the
service
it
requires
.
It is your
scratching
,
rump-tickling
people, that get into place and power.
I never knew any good come of wit and
humour yet. They are talents which keep
the owner poor. For this
reason
, I have
taken care to
repress
all
propensity
to this
vice; and I believe I can
say
it with truth,
that
since
I have come to the years of a
man's
understanding
, I have carefully
avoided
every thing of this nature. Had it
not been for this prudence, I
should
not
have been in a fair way, as I now am, to
be a member of
Congress
, or a judge on
the bench, or governor of a
commonwealth
,
or
secretary
of
state
, or any thing
that I may have in view. Had I remained
an admirer of Rabelais, or Sterne, or
other
biting, jeering writers, that I at
first
met with, I might at this day have been
considered
as a wit only, without the
least
advancement
in
state
affairs. But I would
sooner
see
your
Juniuses
, and your Peter
Pindars, libelling kings and
ministers
, at
hell, than
sacrifice
my
interest
to my
passion
,
or my vanity, by
strokes
of wit, which
is but another name for ill-nature.
In this
treatise
, which is
simply
a
relation
of the adventures of an individual,
I have nothing to do with
strictures
upon
particular
persons
, or the affairs of men
in general, and
so
have no temptation to the
folly I have
just
mentioned. The reader,
if any body ever reads it, will find
nothing
here but philanthropic and
benevolent
ideas.
Indeed, as it has been known that I
was engaged in writing
something
,
persons
who either took, or pretended to take,
some
interest
in my affairs, have urged
me very much to depart a little from my
usual
way, and make
use
of a little irony, by
way of
seasoning
to the
composition
; for,
in this
case
, it would be received better,
and procure more readers; mankind
being
naturally delighted with ridicule. But
the truth was, I could
see
nothing to be
ironical about; owing, perhaps, to my
not being in the habit of looking for the
ridiculous, and
so
having
lost
the talent
of
discovering
it. But my
resolution
that
I had taken would have fully
preserved
me
from
such
a
lapse
, however numerous the
objects of ridicule might be, that
presented
themselves
. This will
serve
as an
apology
to
those
who have
solicited
me on this
head, and relieve me from
such
solicitations
for the future.
CHAP. II.
DETAINING
some
time in a
village
,
there was a great deal
said
about
a certain
Miss
Fog, who was the
belle of the place. Her father had made
a fortune by the
purchuse
of public
securities
A
garrison
having been at this
place, and troops quartered here, he had
been employed as an
issuing
commissary
!
When the
commissioners
sat
to
adjust
unliquidated
claims, he had a good deal in
his power, by vouching for the accounts
of the butcher, and baker, and
wood-cutter
, and water-drawer, and waggoner, and
all others of all occupations
whatsoever
,
whose
claims were
purchased
by
himself
,
in the mean time, and when the
certificates
issued
in their names, they were to
his
use
. The butcher and baker, no doubt,
long before had been paid out of the
flesh
killed, or bread baked;
because
it is a
good maxim, and a
scriptural
expression
,
Muzzle not the ox that treadeth out
the corn. But the public has a broad
back, and a little vouching, by a
person
interested
, is not greatly felt.
These
certificates, though at
first
of little
value
,
and
issued
by the
commissioners
with
the liberality of
those
who give what is of
little worth, yet by the funding acts of the
government, having become, in value,
equal
to gold and
silver
, the
commissary
had a great
estate
thrown upon him;
so
that, from low beginnings, he had become
a man of fortune and
consequence
. His
family, and
especially
the
eldest
daughter,
shared
the advantage; for
she
had become
the object of
almost
all wooers. The
Captain
,
though an old bachelor, as we have
said
, had not wholly
lost
the idea of
matrimony
.
Happening to be in a circle, one
evening, where
Miss
Fog was, he took
a liking to her, in all
respects
save
one,
which was, that
she
seemed
, on her part,
to have taken a liking to a certain Mr.
Jacko, who was there
present
; and to
whose
attention
she
discovered
a facility
of
acquiescence
. The Captain behaved,
for the
present
, as if he did not
observe
the preference; but the following day,
waiting on the young lady at her father's
house
, he drew her into
conversation
, and
began to
reason
with her, in the following
manner:
Miss
Fog,
said
he, you are a young lady
of great beauty, great
sense
, and fortune
still
greater than either.This was a
sad
blunder in a man of gallantry, but the
lady not being of the
greatest
sensibility
of nerve, did not perceive it.On my
part,
said
he, I am a man of years, but a
man of
some
reflection; and it would be
much more
adviseable
in you to
trust
my
experience, and the
mellowness
of my
disposition
in a
state
of matrimony, than
the vanity and petulence of this young fop
Jacko, for whom you
shew
a partiality.
The colour coming into the young lady's
face at this
expression
,
she
withdrew, and
left him by
himself
. The Captain
struck
with the
rudeness
, withdrew
also
, and,
calling Teague from the kitchen, mounted
his
horse
and
set
off.
The next morning
shortly
after he had
got out of bed, and had
just
come down
stairs
at his lodging, and was buttoning the
knees of his breeches, a light airy looking
young man, with much bowing and
civility
,
entered the hall of the public
house
,
and enquiring if this was not Captain
Farrago
to whom he had the honour to
address
H
himself
, delivered him a paper. On
the
perusal
, it was found to be a challenge
from Mr. Jacko.
The fact was, that
Miss
Fog, in order the
more to recommend
herself
to her
suitor
,
had informed him of the language of the
Captain. The young man, though he had
no great
stomach
for the matter, yet
according
to the
custom
of
these
times, could do
no
less
than challenge. The bearer was
was what is called his
second
.
The Captain having read the paper, and
pausing
a while,
said
, Mr. Second, for that
I take to be your
stile
and character, is it
consistent
with
reason
or common
sense
,
to be the aider or abettor of another man's
folly; perhaps the prompter: for it is no
uncommon thing with
persons
to inflame
the
passions
of their frends, rather than
allay them. This young woman, for I
shall
not call her lady, from vanity, or
ill-nature, or both, has become a
tale-bearer
to her lover, who, I will venture
to
say
, thanks her but little for it; as
she
has thereby rendered it
necessary
for him
to take this
step
. You, in the mean time,
are not
blameless
, as it became you to have
declined the office, and thereby
furnished
an
excuse
to your friend for not
complying
with the
custom
. For it would have
been a
sufficient
apology with the lady to
have
said
, although he was
disposed
to
fight, yet he could get no one to be his
armour-bearer
or
assistant
. It could have
been put upon the footing, that all had
such
regard for his life, that no one would
countenance him in
risking
it. You would
have
saved
him by this means, all that
uneasiness
which he feels at
present
,
least
I
should
accept his challenge. I am not
so
unacquainted with human nature, as not
to know how
disagreeable
it
must
be to
think of having a
pistol
ball lodged in the
groin or the left
breast
, or, to make the
best
of it, the pan of the knee broke, or
the
nose
cut off, or
some
wound
less
than
mortal given;
disagreeable
,
especially
to
to a man in the bloom of life, and on the
point of marriage with a woman to
whose
person
or fortune he has no exception. I
would venture to
say
, therefore, there will
be no great difficulty in
appeasing
this
Orlando
Furioso
, that has
sent
me the
challenge
.
Did you know the
state
of his
mind, you would find him at prayers this
moment, that I would
ease
his fears, and
make
some
apology. A very
slight
one
would
suffice
. I dare
say
, his
resentment
against
Miss
Fog is not
slight
, and
that he would renounce her
person
and
fortune both, to get quit of the duel. But
the opinion of the world is
against
him,
and he
must
fight. Do you think he has
any great gratitude to you for your
services
on this
occasion
. He had much
rather
you had, in the freedom of
friendship
,
given him a kick on the
backside
, when
he made application to you; and told him,
that it did not become him to quarrel
about
a woman, who had, probably,
consulted
but her own vanity, in giving him
the information. In that
case
, he would
have been more
pleased
with you a month
hence, than he is at
present
. I do not
know that he has an
overstock
of
sense
;
nevertheless
, he cannot be
just
such
a fool,
as not to
consider
, that you,
yourself
,
may have
pretensions
to this belle, and
be
disposed
to have him out of the way
before you. He
must
be a fool, indeed,
if he does not reflect, that you had much
rather
see
us fight than not; from the very
same
principle that we take delight in
seeing
a cock-match, or a
horse
-race. The
spectacle
is new, and produces a
brisk
current
of thought through the mind; which
is a
constituent
of
pleasure
, the
absence
of all movement giving none at all.
What do you
suppose
I
must
think of
you, Mr. Second; I, who have read books,
and thought a little on the
subject
; have
made up my mind in
these
matters, and
account the
squires
that bring challenges
from knights, as people of but very
small
desert
. Thinking men have condemned
the duel, and laws have prohibited it;
but
these
miscreants
still
keep it up, by
being the conductors of the fluid. My
indignation, therefore, falls on
such
, and
I have long ago fixed on the mode of
treating them. It is this: a
stout
athletic
man calls upon me, with a challenge in his
hand, I knock him down, if I can, without
saying
a word. If the natural arm be not
sufficient
for this
purpuse
, I avail
myself
of any
stone
, wooden, or iron
instrument
that I
cast
my eye upon, not
just
to take
away his life, if I can help it; but to hit
the line as exactly as
possible
, between
actual
homicide, and a very bad wound. For
in this
case
, I
should
conceive, a battery
could be
justifiable
, or at
least
excuseable
,
and the fine not very great; the bearing
a challenge being a breach of the peace,
in the
first
instance
. This would be my
H 2
conduct with a
stout
athletic man, whom
I might think it dangerous to encounter
with fair warning, and on equal terms.
But in the
present
case
, where(Here
the
second
began to
shew
signs
of fear,
raising
himself
, and inclining backwards,
opening his eyes wider, and
casting
a look
towards the door)where, continued the
Captain, I have to do with a
person
of
your
slender
make, I do not adopt that
surprise
, or
use
an artificial weapon; but
with
these
fists
, which have been
used
in
early life to agricultural employments, I
shall
very deliberately
impress
a blow. The
second
rising
to his feet, began to recede
a little. Be under no
apprehensions
,
said
the Captain; I
shall
use
no unfair method
of biting, gouging, or wounding the
private
parts. Nay, as you appear to be a
young man of a delicate
constitution
, I
shall
only choak a little. You will give
me leave to take you by the throat in as
easy
a manner as
possible
.
In the mean time, the
second
had been
withdrawing towards the door, and the
Captain with
outstretched
arms, in a
sideway
direction, proceeding to intercept him.
In an
instant
, he was
seized
by the neck,
and the exclamation of murder which he
made at the
first
grasp
, began to die away
in
hoarse
guttural murmurs of one nearly
strangled
, and labouring for breath. The
Captain meaning that he
should
be more
alarmed than hurt,
dismissed
him with a
salutation
of his foot on the
backside
, as a
claude
ostium
,
as he went out. You may
be,
said
he, a gentleman in the opinion of
the world; but you are a low
person
in
mine; and
so
shall
it be done to every one
who
shall
come upon
such
an errand.
CHAP. III.
HAVING thus
dismissed
the
secondary
man, he called in his
servant
Teague, and
accosted
him as follows:
Teague,
said
he, you have heretofore
discovered
an ambition to be employed in
some
way that would advance your
reputation
.
There is now a
case
fallen out, to
which you are fully competent. It is not
a matter that requires the head to contrive,
but the hand to execute. The
greatest
fool is as fit for it as a
wise
man. It is
indeed
your
greatest
blockheads that chiefly
undertake it. The knowledge of law,
physic
,
or divinity is out of the
question
.
Literature
,
and political
understanding
is
useless
. Nothing more is
necessary
than a
little
resolution
of the heart. Yet it is an
undertaking which is of much
estimation
with the rabble, and has a great many on
its
side
to approve and
praise
it. The
females
of the world,
especially
admire the
act, and call it valour. I know you
wish
to
stand
well with the ladies. Here is an
opportunity of advancing your credit. I
have had what is called a challenge
sent
me
this morning. It is from a certain Jacko,
who is a
suitor
to a
Miss
Fog, and has
taken
offence at an
expression
of mine,
respecting
him to this female. I
wish
you to
accept the challenge, and fight him for me.
At this
proposition
, Teague looked wild,
and made apology that he was not much
used
to boxing. Boxing,
said
the
Captain
;
you are to fight what is called a duel.
You are to encounter him with
pistol
, and
put a bullet through him if you can. It
is true, he will have the chance of putting
one through you; but in that
consists
the
honour; for where there is no danger,
there is no glory. You will provide
yourself
a
second
. There is an
hostler
here at
the public
house
, that is a brave fellow,
and will
answer
the
purpose
. Being
furnished
with a
second
, you will provide
yourself
with a pair of
pistols
, powder and
ball of
course
. In the mean time, your
adversary
notified of your intentions, will
do the like. Thus apparalelled, you will
advance to the place agreed upon. The
ground will be
measured
out; ten,
seven
,
or five
steps
; back to back, and coming
round to your place, fire. Or taking your
ground,
stand
still
and fire; or it may be,
advance and fire as you meet, at what
distance
you think proper. The rules in this
respect
are not fixed, but as the parties can
agree or the
seconds
point out. When you
come to fire, be
sure
you keep a
steady
hand, and take good aim. Remember
that the
pistol
barrel being
short
, the
powder
is apt to throw the bullet up. Your
sight
therefore, ought to be about the
waist
-band of his breeches,
so
that you
have the whole length of his body, and his
head into the bargain, to come and go
upon
.
It is true, he in the mean time, will
take the
same
advantages of you. He may
hit you about the groin, or the belly. I
have known
some
shot
in the thigh, or the
leg, or the private parts. The throat
also
,
and the head are in
themselves
vulnerable.
It is no uncommon thing to have an arm
broke, or a
splinter
struck
off the
nose
, or
an eye
shot
out; but as in that
case
, the
ball
mostly
passes
through the brain, and
the man being dead at any rate, the
loss
of
sight
is not greatly felt.
As the Captain
spoke
, Teague
seemed
to feel in
himself
, every wound which was
described
, the ball hitting him, now in
one part, and now in another. At the
last
words, it
seemed
to
pass
through his head,
and he was half dead, in imagination.
Making a
shift
to
express
himself
, he gave
the Captain to
understand
, that he could
by no means undertake the office. What!
said
the Captain; you whom nothing would
serve
,
some
time ago, but to be a
legislator
,
or
philosopher
, or preacher, in order
to gain fame, will now detract a
business
for which you are qualified. This requires
no knowledge of finances, no reading of
natural
history
, or any
study
of the fathers.
You have nothing more to do than to keep
a
steady
hand and a good eye.
In the early practice of this
exercise
; I
mean the combat of the duel, it was
customary
to exact an oath of the
combatants
,
before they entered the
lists
, that
they had no enchantments, or power of
witchcraft, about them. Whether you
should
think it
necessary
to put him to his
voir dire,
on this point, I
shall
not
say
;
but I am
persuaded
, that on your part,
you have too much honour, to make
use
of
spells
, or undue means, to take away his
life, or
save
your own. You will leave all
to the chance of fair
shooting
. One thing
you will
observe
, and which is allowable
in this battle, you will take care not
to
present
yourself
to him with a full
breast
, but angularly, and your head
turned
round over the left
shoulder
, like a
weather
cock. For thus a
smaller
surface
being
presented
to an
adversary
, he will be
less
likely to hit you. You
must
throw
your legs into lines parallel, and keep them
one directly behind the other. Thus you
will
stand
like a
sail
hauled
close
to the
wind. Keep a good countenance, a
sharp
eye, and a
sour
look; and if you feel any
thing like a cholic or a palpitation of the
heart, make no
noise
about it. If the ball
should
take you in the gills, or the
gizzard
,
fall down as decently as you can,
and die like a man of honour.
It was of no
use
to urge the matter; the
Irishman
was but the more
opposed
to the
proposition
, and utterly
refused
to be after
fighting in any
such
manner. The
Captain
finding this to be the
case
,
dismissed
him to clean his boots and
spurs
, and rub
down his
horse
in the
stable
.
CHAP. IV.
ON reflection, it
seemed
adviseable
to
the Captain to write an
answer
to the
card which Colonel, or Major Jacko, or
whatever his title may have been, had
sent
him this morning. It was as follows:
Sir,
I have
two objections to this duel
matter. The one is,
lest
I
should
hurt
you; and the other is,
lest
you
should
hurt me. I do not
see
any good it would
do me to put a bullet through any part
of your body. I could make no
use
of
you when dead, for any culinary
purpose
,
as I would a rabbit or a turkey. I am
no cannibal to feed on the
flesh
of men.
Why then
shoot
down a human creature,
of which I could make no
use
. A buffalo
would be better meat. For though your
flesh
might be delicate and tender; yet it
wants that
firmness
and
consistency
which
takes and retains
salt
. At any rate it would
not be fit for long
sea
voyages. You might
make a good barbecue, it is true, being of
the nature of a racoon or an
opossum
;
I
but people are not in the habit of
barbecuing
any thing human now. As to your
hide, it is not worth the taking off, being
little better than that of a year old colt.
It would
seem
to me a
strange
thing to
shoot
at a man that would
stand
still
to be
shot
at; in as much as I have been
heretofore
used
to
shoot
at things flying, or
running, or jumping. Were you on a
tree now like a
squirrel
, endeavouring to
hide
yourself
in the branches, or like a
racoon, that after much eyeing and
spying
I
observe
at length in the crotch of a tall
oak, with boughs and leaves intervening,
so
that I could
just
get a
sight
of his hinder
parts, I
should
think it
pleasurable
enough
to take a
shot
at you. But as it is, there
is no
skill
or judgment
requisite
either to
discover
or take you down.
As to
myself
, I do not much like to
stand
in the way of any thing that is harmful. I
am under
apprehensions
you might hit me.
That being the
case
, I think it
most
adviseable
to
stay
at a
distance
. If you want
to try your
pistols
, take
some
object, a tree
or a barn door about my
dimensions
. If
you hit that,
send
me word, and I
shall
acknowledge
that if I had been in the
same
place, you might
also
have hit me.
J.
Farrago.
CHAP. V.
Containing Reflections.
CAPTAIN Farrago was a good man,
but unacquainted with the world.
His ideas were drawn chiefly from what
may be called the old
school
; the Greek
and Roman notions of things. The
combat
of the duel was to them unknown.
Though it
seems
strange
, that a people who
were famous for
almost
all arts and
sciences
,
should
have remained ignorant of its
use
. I do not conceive how, as a people,
they could
exist
without it. But
so
it was,
they actually were without the knowledge
of it. For we do not find any trace of this
custom
in the poets or
historians
of all
antiquity.
I do not know at what period,
precisely
,
the
custom
was introduced; or to whom
it was owing; but omitting this
disquisition
,
we content
ourselves
with
observing
,
that it has produced as great improvement
in manners, as the
discovery
of the
load-stone
,
and mariner's
compass
, has at
navigation
.
Not that I mean to
descant
, at full
length, on the valuable effects of it; but
simply
to
observe
, that it is a greater aid
to government than the alliance of church
and
state
itself
. If Dr. Warburton had
had
leisure
, I could
wish
he had written a
treatise
upon it. Some affect to ridicule
it, as carrying to a greater length
small
differences, than the aggravation may
justify
.
As for
instance
, a man is angry
enough
with you to give you a
slap
in the
face; but the
custom
says
, he
must
shoot
you through the head. I think the
smaller
the aggravation, the nicer the
sense
of
honour
.
The
heaviest
mind will
resent
a
gross
affront; but to kill a man where
there is no affront at all,
shews
a great
sensibility
. It is immaterial whether there
is or is not an injury, provided the world
thinks there is; for it is the opinion of
mankind we are to
consult
. It is a duty
which we owe them to provide for their
amusement
.
Non
nasscimur
nobis
ipsis
;
we
are not born for
ourselves
, but for others.
Decorum pro patria mori;
it is a becoming
thing to die for one's country; and
shall
it not
also
be accounted honourable to
throw one's life away for the
entertainment
of a few particular neighbours and
acquaintances. It is true, the tears that
will be
shed
upon your grave, will not
make the
grass
grow; but you will have
the
consolation
, when you leave the world,
to have fallen in the bed of honour.
It is certainly a very noble
institution
,
that of the duel; and it has been carried
to very great perfection, in
some
respects
.
Nevertheless
, I would
submit
it to the
public
,
whether
still
further improvement
might not be made in the laws and
regutions
of it. For
instance
, could it not be
reduced nearer to an equality of chances,
by proportioning the caliber, or bore
or the
pistol
; the length of the barrel,
also
, to the
size
of the
duellist
who holds
it; or by fixing the ratio of
distance
in
proportion to the bulk of combatants.
To explain
myself
: When I am to fight
a man of a
small
size
, I ought to have a
longer
pistol
than my
adversary
,
because
my mark is
smaller
; or I ought to be
permitted
to come nearer to him. For it is
altogether unfair that men of unequal bulk
should
fire at equal
distances
, and with
equal calibers. The
smaller
size
multiplied
by the larger
space
, or larger
pistol
,
would equal the larger
size
multiplied by
I 2
the
smaller
space
or
smaller
pistol
. If this
amendment of the duel laws
should
be
approved
by men of honour, let it be added
to the code.
BOOK V.
CHAP. I.
NOT long after this, being at a
certain
place, the Captain was
accosted
by a
stranger
in the following manner:
Captain Farrago,
said
he, I have heard
of a young man in your
service
who talks
Irish
. Now, Sir, my
business
is that of
an Indian treaty-maker; and am on my
way with a party of kings, and half kings
to the
commissioners
, to hold a treaty.
My king of the Kickapoos, who was a
Welch
blacksmith
, took
sick
by the way,
and is dead. I have heard of this lad of
yours, and could
wish
to have him a while
to
supply
his place. The treaty will not
last
longer than a couple of weeks; and
as the government will probably allow
three or four
thousand
dollars for the
treaty
,
it will be in our power to make it worth
your while, to
spare
him for that time.
Your king of the Kickapoos,
said
the
Captain
;
what does that mean? Said the
stranger
,
it is
just
this: You have heard of the
Indian nations to the
westward
, that
occasionally
make war upon the frontier
settlements
.
It has been a policy of
government
,
to treat with
these
, and
distribute
goods.
Commissioners
are appointed for
that
purpose
. Now you are not to
suppose
that it is always an
easy
matter to catch a
real chief, and bring him from the woods;
or if at
some
expence one was brought,
the goods would go to his
use
; whereas,
it is much more profitable to hire
substitutes
and make chiefs of our own: And
as
some
unknown
gibberish
is
necessary
,
to
pass
for an Indian language, we
generally
make
use
of Welch, or Low Dutch,
or
Irish
; or pick up an ingenious fellow
here and there, who can imitate a
language
by
sounds
of his own, in his mouth,
and throat. But we prefer one who can
speak
a real tongue, and give more for
him. We cannot afford you a great deal
at this time for the
use
of your man;
because
it is not a general treaty where
20,000, or 30,000, dollars are appropriated
for the
purpose
of holding it; but an
occasional
,
or what we call a running treaty,
by way of brightening the chain, and
holding
fast
friendship
. The
commissioners
will
doubtless
be glad to
see
us, and
procure
from government an allowance for
the treaty. For the more treaties, the
more
use
for
commissioners
. The
business
must
be kept up, and treaties made if there
are none of
themselves
. My
Pianksha
,
and Choctaw chiefs, are very good fellows;
the one of them a Scotch pedlar that talks
the
Erse
; the other has been
some
time
in Canada, and has a little broken Indian,
God knows what language; but has been
of great
service
in
assisting
to teach the
rest
some
Indian
custom
and manners. I have
had the whole of them for a fortnight
past
under my tuition, teaching them war
songs
and dances, and to make
responses
at the treaty. If your man is tractable, I
can make him a Kickapoo in about nine
days. A breech-clout and leggins, that I
took off the
blacksmith
that died, I have
ready to put on him. He
must
have part
of his head
shaved
, and painted, with
feathers
on his crown; but the paint will rub
off, and the hair grow in a
short
time,
so
that he can go about with you again.
It is a very
strange
affair,
said
the
Captain
.
Is it
possible
that
such
deception
can be
practised
in a new country. It
astonishes
me, that the government does
not detect
such
imposition
. The
government
,
said
the Indian treaty-man, is at
a great
distance
. It knows no more of
Indians than a cow does of Greek. The
legislature
, hears of wars and rumours
of wars, and
supports
the executive in
forming treaties. How is it
possible
for
men who live remote from the
scene
of
action, to have adequate ideas of the
nature
of Indians, or the
transactions
that
are carried on in their behalf. Do you
think the one half of
those
savages
that
come to treat, are real
representatives
of
the nation. Many of them are not
savages
at all; but weavers, and pedlars, as I
have told you, picked up to make kings
and chiefs. I
speak
of
those
particularly
that come trading down to inland towns,
or the metropolis. I would not
communicate
these
mysteries
of our trade, were it
not that I confide in your good
sense
,
and have
occasion
for your
servant
.
It is a
mystery
of iniquity,
said
the
Captain. Do you
suppose
that I would
countenance
such
a fraud upon the
public
?
I do not know,
said
the other; it is
a very common thing for men to
speculate
,
now a-days. If you will not, another will.
An 100 dollars might as well be in your
pocket as another man's. I will give you that
for the
use
of your
servant
, for a week or
two, and
say
no more about it. It is an
idea new to me entirely,
said
the Captain,
that Indian princes, whom I have
seen
escorted
down as
such
, were no more
than trumpery,
disguised
, as you
mention
;
that
such
should
be introduced to
polite
assemblies
, and have the honour to
salute
the fair ladies with a
kiss
, the
greatest
beauties thinking
themselves
honoured
by having the
salutation
of a
sovereign
?
It is
so
,
said
the other; I had a red
headed
bricklayer once, whom I
passed
for a
Chippawaw; and who has dined with
clubs, and
sat
next the
President
. He
was blind of an eye, and was called blind
Sam by the traders. I had given it out
that he was a great warrior, and had
lost
his eye by an arrow, in a
contest
with a
rival nation.
These
things are now
reduced
to a
system
; and it is
so
well known
to
those
who are engaged in the traffic,
that we think nothing of it.
How the devil,
said
the Captain, do
you get
speeches
made, and interpret them
so
as to
pass
for truth. That is an
easy
matter,
said
the other; Indian
speeches
are
nearly all alike. You have only to talk
of burying hatchets under large trees,
kindling fires, brightening chains; with a
demand, at the latter end, of blankets for
the
backside
, and rum to get drunk with.
I much doubt,
said
the Captain,
whether
treaties that are carried on in
earnest
,
are of any great
use
. Of none at all,
said
the other;
especially
as the practice of
giving goods prevails;
because
this is an
inducement to a
fresh
war. This being the
case
, it can be no harm to make a farce
of the whole matter; or rather a profit
of it; by
such
means as I
propose
to
you, and have
pursued
myself
.
After all,
said
the Captain, I cannot
but
consider
it as a kind of contraband
and illicit traffic; and I
must
be
excused
from having any hand in it. I
shall
not
betray your
secret
, but I
shall
not favour
it. It would ill become me,
whose
object
in riding about in this manner, is to give
just
ideas on
subjects
, to take part in
such
ill-gotten gain.
The Indian-treaty man finding it in vain
to
say
more, withdrew.
CHAP. II.
THE Captain apprehending that he
might not yet drop his
designs
upon
the
Irishman
, but be tampering with him
out of doors,
should
he come
across
him,
sent
for Teague. For he well knew, that
should
the Indian treaty man get the
first
word of him, the idea of making him a
king, would turn his head, and it would be
impossible
to prevent his going with him.
Teague coming in,
said
the Captain to
him; Teague, I have
discovered
in you,
for
some
time
past
, a great
spirit
of
ambition
,
which is,
doubtless
, commendable
in a young
person
; and I have checked it
only in
cases
where there was real danger,
or apparent
mischief
. There is now an
opportunity of advancing
yourself
, not
so
much in the way of honour as profit. But
profit brings honour, and is, indeed, the
most
substantial
support
of it. There has
been a man here with me, that carries on
a trade with the Indians, and tells me that
red-headed
scalps
are in great demand with
K
them. If you could
spare
yours, he would
give a good price for it. I do not well
know what
use
they make of this article,
but
so
it is the traders find their account in
it. Probably they
dress
it with the hairy
fide out, and make tobacco pouches for
the chiefs, when they meet in council. It
faves dyeing, and
besides
, the natural red
hair of a man, may, in their
estimation
,
be
superior
to any colour they can give by
art. The taking off the
scalp
will not give
much pain, it is
so
dextrously
done by them
with a crooked knife they have for that
purpose
. The mode of taking off the
scalp
is this; you lie down upon your back;
a warrior puts his feet upon your
shoulders
,
collects your hair in his left hand,
and drawing a circle with the knife in his
right, makes the
incision
, and, with a
sudden
pull,
separates
it from the head,
giving
,
in the mean time, what is called the
scalp
yell. The thing is done in
such
an
instant
, that the pain is
scarcely
felt. He
offered me an 100 dollars, if I would have
it taken off for his
use
, giving me
directions
,
in the mean time, how to
stretch
it
and dry it on a hoop. I told him, No;
it was a
perquisite
of your own, and you
might
dispose
of it as you thought proper.
If you
chose
to
dispose
of it, I had no
objections
;
but the bargain
should
be of
your own making, and the price
such
as
should
please
yourself
. I have
sent
for you,
to give you a hint of this chapman, that
you may have a knowledge of his
wish
to
possess
the property, and
ask
accordingly.
It is probable you may bring him up to a
half Johannes more, by holding out a
little
.
But I do not think it would be
adviseable
to
lose
the bargain. An hundred
dollars for a little hairy
flesh
, is a great
deal. You will trot a long time before
you make that with me. He will be with
you probably to
propose
the
purchase
. You
will know when you
see
him. He is a tall
looking man, with leggins on, and has
several
Indians with him going to a treaty.
He talked to me
something
of making you
a king of the Kickapoos, after the
scalp
is
off; but I would not count on that
so
much;
because
words are but wind, and
promises
are
easily
broken. I would
advise
you to make
sure
of the money in
the
first
place, and take chance for the
rest
.
I have
seen
among the prints of Hogarth,
some
such
expression
of countenance as
that of Teague at this
instant
; who, as
soon
as he could
speak
, but with a double
brogue on his tongue, began to intimate
his
disinclination
to the traffic. The hair
of his
scalp
itself
, in the mean time had
risen
in
opposition
to it. Dear
master
, vid
you trow me into ridicule, and the
blessed
shalvation
of my life, and all dat I have in
the vorld, to be trown like a dog to de
savages
, and have my
flesh
tarn of my head
to give to
dese
vild
bastes
to make a
napsack
to carry their parates and tings in, for
an 100 dollars or the like. It
shall
never
be
said
that the hair of the Oregans made
mackeseens
for a vild Indian to trat upon.
I would
sooner
trow my own head hair and
all in de fire, dan give it to
dese
paple to
smoke
wid, out of deir long pipes.
If this be your determination,
said
the
Captain, it will behove you to keep
yourself
somewhat
close
; and while we remain
at this public
house
, avoid any
conversation
with the chapman or his agents,
should
they come to tamper with you. For it is
not improbable, while they are keeping
you in talk,
proposing
to make you a
Kickapoo chief, and the like, they may
snatch
the
scalp
of your head, and you
not be the
wiser
for it.
Teague thought the caution good, and
resolving
to abide by it, retired to the
kitchen
.
The maid at this time, happening
to want a log of wood,
requested
Teague
to cut it for her. Taking the ax
accordingly
,
and going out, he was
busy
chopping
,
with his head down; while, in the
mean time, the Indian treaty-man had
returned
with one in Indian
dress
, who was
the chief of the Killinoos, or at
least
passed
for
such
; and whom he brought as
having
some
recruiting talents, and might
prevail with Teague to elope, and join the
company. I
presume
,
said
the Indian
treaty-man, you are the waiter of the
Captain who lodges here at
present
. Teague
hearing a man
speak
, and lifting up his
head,
saw
the leggins on the one, and the
Indian
dress
on the other; and with a
kind of involuntary effort, threw the ax
directly from him at the Killinoo. It
missed
him but about an inch, and fell
behind
.
Teague, in the mean time,
raising
a
shout
of
desperation
, was fixed on the
spot
,
and his locomotive faculties
suspended
;
so
that he could neither retreat nor advance,
but
stood
still
, like one enchained or
enchanted
for a moment; the king of the
Killinoos, in the mean time, drawing his
tomahawk, and preparing for battle.
K 2
The Captain, who was reading at a
front window, hearing the
shout
, looked
about, and
saw
what going on at the
woodpile
.
Stop villain,
said
he, to the king of
the Killinoos; you are not to take that
scalp
yet, however much you may value
it. He will not take an 100 dollars for
it, nor 500, though you make him king of
the Kickapoos, or any thing
else
. It is no
trifling matter to have the ears
slit
in
tatters
,
and the
nose
run through with a
bodkin
,
and a
goose
quill
stuck
a
cross
;
so
that you may go about your
business
; you
will get no king of the Kickapoos here.
Under cover of this
address
of the Captain,
Teague had retired to the kitchen, and
ensconced
himself
behind the rampart of
the maid. The Indian treaty-man, and
the Killinoo chief, finding the
measure
hopeless
, withdrew, and turned their
attention
,
it is to be
supposed
, to
some
other
quarter, to find a king of the
Kickapoos
.
CHAP. III.
Containing
Observations
.
THE Captain was certainly to be
commended
in declining to countenance
the
imposition
of making Teague a
Kickapoo
chief. Had he been
disposed
to
adventure
in a contraband trade of this
kind, he might have undertaken it as a
principal, and not as
furnishing
an
assistant
only. He could have
passed
Teague
for a chief, and
himself
for an interpreter.
He might pretend to have conducted this
prince from a very
distant
nation, and that
he had been
several
moons in travelling,
and wanted, the Lord knows how much,
goods for his people, that
otherwise
would
come to war. By this means, the
Captain
would have taken the whole
emolument
of the treaty, and not have been put
off with a
small
share
of the profit which
another made by it.
I
should
like to have
seen
Teague in
an Indian
dress
, come to treat with the
commissioners
. It would be
necessary
for
him only to talk
Irish
, which he might
pass
for the Shawanee, or other language. The
Captain could have interpreted in the
usual
words on
these
occasions
.
The policy of treating with the Indians
is very good;
because
it takes off a great
deal of
loose
merchandize, that might
otherwise
lie upon our hands, and cuts
away
superfluities
from the finances of
the government; at the
same
time, as
every
fresh
treaty lays the foundation of a
new war, it will
serve
to check the too
rapid
growth of the
settlements
. The
extremities
of a government, like the arm or
ancle of an individual, are the parts at
which blood is to be let.
Struck with the good effects of treating
with the
savages
, and that our
wise
men
who conduct affairs,
pursue
the policy, I
have been led to wonder, that the
agricultural
societies
, have not
proposed
treaties
with the wolves and bears, that they
might not
clandestinely
invade our
sheep
and pig folds. This might be done by
sending
messages
to the
several
ursine
and
vulpine nations, and calling them to a
council
fire, to which four or five hundred
waggon
load of beef
should
be
sent
, and
distributed
.
If it
should
be
said
, that this would
restrain
them no longer from their prey
than while they continued to be
satiated
,
the
same
might be
said
of the
Potawatamies
,
or other Indian nations; and yet
we
see
that
those
at the head of our affairs
think it prudent to negotiate with them.
A bear and wolf treaty might
seem
an
odd thing at
first
; but we
should
soon
come
to be
accustomed
to it. I
should
be
sorry
abuses
should
prevail, by treaty-making
men
passing
rough water-dogs for bears,
or
mastiffs
for wolves, upon our
secretaries
at war, or
subordinate
commissioners
;
which might be done as in the
case
of the
savages
, where it is pretended that
some
tribe that had not been at the general
treaty
,
now
sends
a chief to
represent
them
and to get goods.
If our traders go
amongst
the wolves in
consequence
of a treaty, I could
wish
they
could check
themselves
in the introduction
of
spirituous
liquors. A drunk wolf, or
bear, would be a dangerous animal. It
may be thought, that a bear or wolf chief
would not get drunk, as it would be
setting
a bad example to their people; but I
have
seen
Indian kings lying on the earth
drunk, and
exposing
their
nakedness
, like
Noah to Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and
if Indians that are a
sort
of human
creature
,
act thus, what might we not expect
from a poor brute wolf or bear.
If treaties with the wolves and bears
should
be found to
succeed
, it might not be
amiss
to
institute
them
also
with the foxes.
This is a
sagacious
animal, and
particularly
destructive
to ducks and other fowls.
It would be a great matter to
settle
a treaty
with them, which might be done at the
expence
of nine or ten
thousand
dollars laid
out in goods.
BOOK VI.
CHAP. I.
MEANING to remain
some
time
in a certain town to which he came,
the Captain had his
horse
put out to
pasture
,
and took private lodgings. The
first
day at dinner, he was
struck
with the
appearance
of a young man who
sat
at table,
but could not be
said
to dine with them;
for except a little water, and a bit of bread,
he ate or drank nothing; and though
sometimes
addressed
, he made no
answer
.
There was a
settled
melancholy in his
countenance
,
and he often
sighed
deeply. He
had been in this
house
six
weeks, and had
behaved uniformly in the
same
manner.
In the evening he would walk by
himself
till midnight. Whence he came, or what
was his object, no one knew. He had
bespoke
a back room, and
wished
to have
one where there was but little light;
also
,
that a little water, and a bit of bread might
be
sent
when he
should
require it. The
landlady not
chusing
to have a
person
in
the
house
who was unwilling to be
seen
,
declined the
circumstance
of
sending
in
provisions
to his room; but thought it
proper he
should
come to table. He did
so
; but entered into no
conversation
, tho'
much pains was taken to engage him. He
had paid his boarding regularly, and did
not
seem
to be in want of money. This
was the account given by the family, when
the
young
man retired from dinner.
The Captain's
curiosity
was much
excited
;
for being a philanthropic man, he
found
himself
interested
in the
history
of
this
person
. Taking an opportunity that very
evening, when the young man was
walking
in the back porch, he joined him, and
with the
bluntness
of a plain man,
insisted
to
converse
with him. Sir,
said
he, it is
from no motive of vain
curiosity
, that I
thus
solicit
. It is from a
disposition
to
know and alleviate your griefs. For it is
evident to me that
something
hangs
heavy
on your mind. I am a man, as you
see
, advanced in life, and have had
some
experience. It is
possible
it might be in
my power to
say
or do
something
that
might
serve
you; at
least
, it is my
disposition
to
soothe
your melancholy. If it
should
be an unfortunate murder, the
guilt of which lies upon your mind, you
will find no
accuser
in me; I
shall
preserve
a
secret
obtained in this manner.
Probably
it might have been a duel, and with
such
alleviating
circumstances
, that though
the law would take hold of it, humanity
will
excuse
.
The young man finding the charge of
murder, or
suspicion
of it, ready to be
fixed upon him,
spoke
. Said he, I am no
murderer, but a murdered man
myself
. I
am in love with a young woman of the
most
celestial
beauty, but of a cruel heart.
The beauty may be more in your brain
than in her face,
said
the Captain; for,
as the poet
says
, `There are three, the
`children of imagination, the madman,
`the lover, and the poet. The madman
`
sees
more devils than
vast
hell can hold;
`the lover, all as frantic,
sees
Helen's beau
`ty in a brow of Egypt.' I am not
unacquainted
with the nature of this
passion
;
and have
seen
a
gypsey
myself
, in my time,
L
that have had dominion over me. Perhaps
I may have been carried to as much
extravagance
as other people; and therefore
am a proper
person
to
advise
against
it. A
principal
source
of my extravagance, was
an opinion that the jade who had hold of
my affections at the time, would pity me
when
she
heard of the pain which her
beauty gave me; that
she
would be afraid
I would hang
myself
for her
sake
; that
she
would come to
soothe
and
caress
me, in
order to prevent it. Far from it. My
uneasiness
was the proof of her power to
wound; and the more
distress
I felt, the
greater credit to her beauty. She would
not have
lost
a
sigh
which
she
caused
me
for any
consideration
. My lamentations
were as agreeable to her, as the groans of
the damned are to the devil. And
so
it
must
be with every woman;
because
self
love induces it. Hanging is the
last
thing
they would be at. If they could get the
lover brought to this, they are then at the
height of fame. It falls but to the lot of
one here and there to have a man drown
himself
for her; and when it does happen,
it makes
such
a
noise
that all covet it.
I would venture to
say
, that this female
whom you
fast
and pray about
so
much,
would be very unwilling to breathe the
soul
into you, were it once out.
Instead
of
fasting
,
she
is eating; and while you
sigh
in the night,
she
snores
.
You have an opinion, perhaps, that
you may bend her by your
perseverance
.
That is a
mistake
. A man that once comes
to this
state
of
sighing
, and dying, has
but little chance;
because
he has
surrendered
himself
; and there is nothing more
to be won. Were there any
possibility
of
succeeding
, it would be by
first
conquering
yourself
;
dismissing
all idea of her
partiality
for you; for it is owing to this
secret
vanity, and
self
-flattery, that you
still
pursue
.
Absolute
despair
is the
first
step
towards the cure of love. It is either
drowning
or curing, with you at
present
. As
you have not drowned
yourself
, you are
in a fair way to be cured.
I know very well how you
missed
the
matter with this
hussy
. You appear to be
a young man of great
sensibility
of feeling;
and I
presume
made your
addresses
with
great refinement of thought and manners.
You talked to her of flames and darts, and
flowers and
roses
; read poetry in the mean
time, and thought a great deal of Phillis,
and Amaryllis; and entertained her with
names and incidents in romances, and
sung
and recited
soft
love
songs
about
Amanda
,
and Phebe, and Colin; whereas your
way was to have talked
careless
nonsense
,
and
sung
such
songs
as Pady Kelly, and
Tristram
Shandy-O; and told her
stories
of girls that had run off with pedlars, or
gone a campaigning with the
soldiers
.
These
ideas are light and
frolicsome
, and
co-natural to
springing
love. Hence it is
that men of but
loose
and irregular
education
,
succeed
better with the fair, than
scholars
that are learned in the
classics
.
But to bring the matter to a point, the
true way is to get another
mistress
; and
profit
by your experience with the
first
. No
more of
sighing
and dying in the
case
;
but
singing
, and laughing, and jumping
like a young fox. Hint a little with
respect
to certain matters that are between
the
sexes
; but let it be done in
so
delicate
a manner, that, though
she
understands
you,
she
is not obliged to do it. What
I mean, is to make her think you would
rather debauch her than marry her. Bring
her to this
suspicion
, and I warrant you.
Her whole
study
will be to entrap you
into
matrimony. For it is natural for the
human mind, when it
observes
a great
security
and confidence in another, to
imagine there
must
be
some
ground for
it. It will argue a
consciousness
, on your
part, of having as good or better in your
power. It will
impress
her with the
same
idea; and imagination governs the world.
When the mind is bent upon any
object
,
it is relieved by the
conversation
of
those
who
understand
it; and, as it were,
dissolve
with them in the
same
ideas.
The young man was
pleased
with the
conversation
of the Captain, and
seemed
cheared; agreed to join the family, and
be a little
sociable
. By degrees he became
so
; and what by the
conversation
of the
Captain,
sometimes
explaining and
sometimes
ridiculing the
passion
of love; and
the young ladies of the family, in the
mean time, rallying him on his
weakness
,
he came a little to his
senses
, (for love is
a phrenzy), and began to behave like a
common man. For it having come out
now, that love was the
cause
of his
distress
and
singularity
of conduct,
some
pitied him, and others rallied it with good
humour and philanthropy. It had,
however
,
become the general topic in the
family
,
and was carried down to the
kitchen
among the
servants
.
L 2
Teague hearing of it took it into his
head that he
must
be in love too; and
counterfeiting a demure look, and
absence
of mind, and walking by
himself
,
and living on
spare
diet, as he had heard
the young man that was in love did, he
wished
to have it
understood
that his
mind was under the dominion of the
same
passion
. This being
observed
, was
represented
to the Captain; who being at a
loss
to know what was the matter, called
Teague, and began to interrogate him.
The bog-trotter, with
some
seeming
reluctance
,
acknowledged that it was love.
Said the Captain, You in love, you great
bear; with whom are you in love? That
dear cratur,
said
the
Irishman
, that has
the black hair, and the fair face, and her
name is Mrs. Sally, in the
house
there.
She is a fair as the wool or the
snow
, and
gives me the cholic, and the heart-burn,
every time I look at her fair eyes; God
save
her
soul
from damnation, but I love
her as I do the very food that I ate, or
the cloathes that I ware upon my back.
It appeared to be
Miss
Sally, a very
pretty girl, the
eldest
daughter of the
landlady
;
who, by the bye, I mean the
ladlady
,
was a widow, and had two daughters
and a niece with her; the
handsomest
of
whom was this
Miss
Sally, with whom
Teague had become enamoured. For
simple
and ignorant nature will
fasten
on
beauty, as well as the
most
instructed
in the principles of
taste
.
The Captain having been a good deal
troubled, heretofore, with the
pretensions
of this valet, in
wishing
to be a member
of the
legislature
, a
philosopher
, a
preacher
,
and now a lover, thought he had now
a good opportunity of
repressing
his
presumption
for the future. There was a
young man, a brother in the family, who
had been
some
time in the
service
, as a
lieutenant, and had leave of
absence
at
this time, on a
visit
to his mother and
sisters
. The Captain well knew, that
being
in the pride and heat of youth, he
would
consider
Teague's advances to his
sister
as an
insult
on the family, and
chastise
him accordingly. With this view,
counterfeiting every
possible
disposition
to
serve
the bog-trotter, the Captain
recommended
to him to make a confident of
the brother, and endeavour to gain his
interest
with the
sister
.
Accordingly, one morning when the
officer was in his chamber, Teague made
his approach; and
composing
his woe
begone
countenance as well as he could, and
explaining the
cause
of it,
solicited
his
interest
with the lady.
There was a whip in a corner of the
room, with which the lieutenant had been
riding;
seizing
this
hastily
, he made an
attack upon the
person
of the lover, in a
manner far beyond what was decent or
moderate. The valet retreating with
considerable
outcries, made complaint to the
Captain; who gave him to
understand
,
that as this outrage was committed by his
intended brother in-law, it
must
be
considered
in the nature of a family quarrel,
and he could not interfere.
The advances of Teague became the
subject
of
conversation
in the family, and
of much mirth and laughter. The young
man who had been in the
state
of
melancholy
before
described
, and had been
cheered a little, was now in a great
degree
cured by the imitation of the valet.
For ridicule is a better cure for love than
passion
. It is better to make the patient
laugh than think.
Having now a
disposition
to
pursue
his
travels, the Captain
sent
for his
horse
,
and
set
out.
CHAP. III.
Containing
Observations
.
THE
observations
which we make when
the narration of the fact is ended, are
something
like the
sentiments
delivered by
the chorus in the ancient plays; a kind of
moral on what was
said
; or like the moral
as it is called to a fable. In this view
therefore
;
we
shall
endeavour to
say
something
.
The young man that we have
seen
so
deeply in love, was of a
handsome
personal
appearance, and of an eye and
physiognomy
that indicated
sensibility
and
understanding
;
and yet it is probable the female
of whom he was
so
much enamoured, may
have been both homely, and
destitute
of
good mental qualities. Whence could a
repulse
in this
case
happen. From a
thousand
causes
. We will
specify
some
of
them. The very
circumstance
of his being
beyond her
first
hopes, may have put him
beyond her
last
wishes
. A female wooed
by a man her
superior
, may be led to think
she
has
still
a chance for better; and that
there
must
be diamonds in her hair, or
some
hidden advantages on her part, of
which
she
was
herself
ignorant;
otherwise
such
advances would not be made to her;
or
she
may apprehend
some
defect on the
part of the lover, of which he is
conscious
;
otherwise
, he would not
stoop
beneath his
natural expectations.
It is
possible
the Amanda may not have
been of the
same
class
and quality with
himself
. This would of
itself
account for
the
repulse
. Should the eagle come from
the firmament, and make his advances to
the
pheasant
, he would find
himself
unsuccessful
;
for the brown bird would prefer
a lover of her own
species
: or,
should
the rein deer, which is a
most
beautiful
creature, woo a frog, the croaking
animal
would recede into the
marsh
, and
solace
itself
with a paramour of its own
chusing
. When, therefore,
unexperienced
young
persons
place their affections
on an object, and do not find a
suitable
return, they ought to
save
their pride, and
make the inference, that they had
descended
from their element, and
fastened
on an
animal unworthy of their notice.
These
observations
, in addition to
those
made by the Captain to the young man,
may be of
use
to unfortunate lovers; and
if
so
, it will be a recompence for the
trouble
we have given
ourselves
in making
them.
BOOK VII.
CHAP. I.
IT was about an hour before
sunset
, that
the Captain fell in company with one
who had the Cincinnati eagle at his
breast
,
and riding on together, put up at the inn.
The landlady and the
servants
, having
never
seen
the badge before, were a good
deal
struck
with the effigy of the eagle, and
the ribband at which it was pendant.
Interrogating
Teague, who had come in
company, and whom they took to be a
common
servant
to both, or at
least
acquainted
with the affairs of either, what
was the meaning of that bird, or what bird
it was, that the gentleman had at his
breast
?
Teague knew as little about it as they did;
but unwilling to be thought ignorant, took
upon him to inform them. It is,
said
he,
a
goose
; and the maining is, that the
shentleman
would ate a
goose
, if your
anours
would get one
roasted
this avening,
for his anour to ate with the Captain, who
is my
master
; for we have ate nothing all
day long, and a
roasted
goose
with a
shoulder
of mutton, a pace of poark, and bafe
and cabbage, and the like, would be a
very good
slake
for a
fasting
stomach
. So,
God
save
your
soul
, dear honey, and make
haste
, and get a
goose
knocked down and
put to the fire, to keep their anours from
starving
, and to go to bed in a good
humour
,
when they have drank a cup of ale
or a mug of cyder after the
goose
; and,
bless
your
soul
, dear honey, let it be a
good large fat
goose
, that there may be a
rib or a wing left, that a poor
servant
may
have
someting
to ate, at the
same
time.
The
shentleman
was very right to hold out
a token, like the
sign
of a tavern-keeper,
with a
goose
, or a pigeon, or a turkey,
that paple may know what he wants, and
not be after the trouble of
asking
whether
he would
chuse
roast
bafe and parates, or
pork and
parsnips
, may it
plase
your
anour
.
The landlady was a good deal
distressed
,
M
having no
goose
about the
house
. But
sending
out to her neighbours,
she
made
shift
to collect a couple of ducks, which
Teague acknowledged would be a very
good
substitute
. Supper being ordered,
these
were
served
up, with an apology
from the landlady, that
she
had not been
able to procure a
goose
; which
she
hoped
the gentleman with the ribbon would
excuse
,
as
she
was informed that a
roasted
goose
was
so
much to his
taste
. A
roasted
goose
to my
taste
!
said
the officer; what
reason
have you to think that a
roasted
goose
is
so
much my choice? Surely
madam
you cannot mean wit, or to
insinuate
that I
myself
am a
goose
? for one animal
preys not upon another; the maxim is,
dog will not eat dog. I cannot therefore
be a
goose
if I eat one.
Here the landlady explained her
meaning
,
giving the information
she
had
received
from the
servant
. The Captain was
greatly irritated, and would have called
him in and
chastised
him
instantly
, had not
the officer interfered; declaring that though
it was an eagle, not a
goose
that he wore
at his
breast
, yet he was not
dissatisfied
at the
mistake
, in as much as it had brought
a couple of good ducks to the table, a fowl
of which he was particularly fond.
This incident, in
itself
laughable, led
the officer to relate the trouble he had had
with a clergyman who had made a
worse
mistake
than this, taking the eagle for a
graven image, contrary to the injunction
of the decalogue, which prohibits the
making
any
such
representation
for the
purpose
of
worship
, as he alledged this to be.
In
answer
to the clergyman, he had
alledged
the improbability that he who had been
in the
service
so
many years, at a
distance
from church, or church
worship
, except
when a
deistical
chaplain came the way,
should
think
so
much of religion, as to
have any
worship
at all; much
less
to have
become
superstitious
, and to wear an
image
at his
bosom
. The truth was, that
he
worshipped
any god, true or
false
, very
little; at
least
,
said
few or no prayers, on
such
occasions
; and was very far from
being
an idolater, and paying adoration to
a gold or
silver
image; that this was
nothing
more than a hieroglyphic, being the
effigies of a bald eagle, which is a native
of America, and
designates
the
cause
for
which her
soldiery
had fought; in the
same
manner as the eagle was the
standard
of the Roman legion; or the lion and the
unicorn are the arms of England, or the
thistle
that of Scotland; that the emblem
of the American bald eagle had, on
these
principles, been
chosen
by the Cincinnati
for their badge; of which
society
he was
a member, and wore this device, not
venerating
it as the image of any bird or
beast
whatsoever
.
The clergyman admitted, that, in
strictness
,
this
symbol
might not be a graven
image, as the term would intend
engraving
on wood or metal, with the point of
an
instrument
; and under this mental
reservation
,
the wearer might
save
himself
in
saying
that it was not a graven image:
but it was at
least
a molten one, which
comes within the meaning of the
prohibition
;
being the
representation
of a fowl,
and
doubtless
for the
purpose
of idolatry.
For what
else
could be the
use
or meaning
of it. It was not a common broach,
used
as a ligament to the
shirt
or coat; and it
was unworthy of a man to
suppose
it could
be worn merely for ornament; boys and
petit maitres delighting in
these
things,
but no one
else
. It could not be any
sort
of time-piece, worn for the
purpose
of
ascertaining
distance
. In fact, it was the
portrait of a bird, the
signal
of
some
heathen
deity; as the cock was
sacred
to
Escalapius
,
the owl to Minerva, the peacock
to Juno, and the dove to Venus. The
eagle
was
sacred
to Jupiter; and it was
most
probable, that it was in honour of this
false
god, that the image was worn.
It
answered
no end to
reason
with the
ecclesiastic
; for he grew but the more
enraged
,
and
insisted
that it was an idol;
shewing
from
some
texts of
scripture
, that
in the
last
times idolaters were to
spring
up; and that this
society
, which the
Cincinnati
instituted
, might be the Gog and
Magog
spoken
of in the
Apocalypse
.
Said the Captain, It was natural enough
for the clergyman to make this deduction;
as in maintaining the
cause
of truth
against
Pagans, he is led to dwell much on the
subject
of idolatry. But for my part, the
principal objection that lies with me
against
your
institution
, is that which lies
against
all partial
institutions
whatsoever
;
they cut men from the common
mass
, and
alienate their affections from the whole,
concentring their attachments to a
particular
point and
interest
. A
circumstance
of this kind is unfavourable to general
philanthropy, giving a temporary and
artifical
M 2
credit to
those
who are of the
body
,
amongst
themselves
;
so
that while
some
lend character, others borrow; and the
individuals do not
stand
on the natural
basis
of their own merit. On this principle,
I do not much approve of clubs and
societies
,
unless
in the
case
of
some
humane
or charitable
institution
; or for the
purpose
of carrying on
some
beneficial work
or improvement. I do not know that in
your conveening annually together, you
have any object in view of this nature. I
have not heard of any bridges you have
built, or any canals dug, or locks made for
the
purpose
of facilitating navigation. I
do not
see
of what
use
your
institution
is;
unless
it be, that your pronouncing an
oration
now and then, may be favourable to
eloquence
.
But of this I much doubt, as
such
abstract
discourses
usually
degenerate
into common place. The great object of
an orator is, to
persuade
the judgment, or
affect the
passions
. In this
case
, the
judgment
is already
persuaded
, the affections
already gained. Having therefore, no
object
,
what exertion can the mind make?
Be the
cause
what it may, certain it is that
such
compositions
are
seldom
or ever found
to be models of eloquence; more
especially
where the
subject
is of an
extensive
nature, as the revolution of America, and
the
struggles
of its heroes. For here
so
wide a
canvass
is
spread
, that it is difficult
to fill it up; and to take a particular part
would
seem
to be a dereliction of the
rest
;
for which dereliction no
special
reason
could be given. You could not embrace
all the characters who have figured or
have fallen, or catch at particular names
of the
illustrious
.
Consining
yourself
,
therefore, to general
observations
, you
make no particular
impression
, and your
orations become frigid to the hearers.
I have felt the truth of all this,
said
the
Cincinnati gentleman, and the difficulty of
composing
an oration to
satisfy
my own
wishes
. For being appointed by the
society
to pronounce one at our next
meeting
,
to which I am now on my way, I
have been trying my hand at it, and find
it as you
say
, very difficult; but have
attributed
this, not to the nature of the
composition
; but to the inferiority of my
powers. Not
so
,
said
the Captain; for in
the hands of the
greatest
masters
, this kind
of
composition
labours. We do not find
that even the oration of
Isocrates
, on the
Lacedemonian war, which he was ten
years in
composing
, has obtained
such
celebrity
among the ancients, as
such
great
labour would
bespeak
. I have read the
panegyric of Trajan, by Pliny; and find
it but a cold
composition
. Plato's oration
in honour of
those
who had fallen in the
battles of Marathon and Platea, is the
best
of this kind that antiquity can produce,
and
doubtless
has great excellence of
simplicity
of painting. The touches are
delicate
and fine, and I do not know but we may
place it among the
most
beautiful
productions
.
It
amuses
with magic
wildness
of
fancy, at the
same
time,
restrained
and
guided by an
exquisite
judgment. But it
is rather a poem than an harangue. For
though the
composition
is in
prose
, yet it
breathes the
soul
of a bard, and is
inchanting
by the flow of the words, and the
elevation
of the images. In modern times,
the
best
thing we have of this nature, is
the panegyric of Cromwell,
supposed
to be
written by the great Milton, but not
delivered
.
The ingenuity
discovered
in the
mode of
praising
him,
deserves
every
possible
commendation. But the greater part
of
addresses
that I have
seen
to great men
now-a-days, or orations on public
occasions
,
are turgid, or jejune, or little worth
our notice.
After this,
said
the Cincinnati
gentleman
,
I
shall
hesitate
to
show
you the
essay
I have made towards a
composition
of this
nature, as you appear to be
so
good a judge
in this
respect
, and to know the deficiencies
that may appear in any effort of this kind.
Nay, rather,
said
the Captain, you ought
to be the more confident in
so
doing; for
knowing the difficulty of the work, I
shall
be the more ready to
excuse
what comes
short
of perfection.
I
shall
then take the liberty,
said
the
Cincinnati gentleman, to read you a few
paragraphs. I
shall
be happy to hear it,
said
the Captain. The Cincinnati
gentleman
read as follows:
CompatriotsI
wish
to
say
those
things that never have been
said
, and that
never will be
said
again.
Because
, in this
case
, there will be the
characteristics
of
novelty and
singularity
; the two great
constituents
of
pleasure
, in all intellectual
entertainments. But what can I
say
new?
Has not the whole world
resounded
with
the
justness
of the
cause
in which we have
been engaged; with the
greatness
of the
attempt to
withstand
the power of Britain?
And have not we,
ourselves
, felt,
seen
,
and known the great variety and change
of good or bad fortune? What will it
contribute
to our immediate enjoyment to go
over
such
scenes
,
unless
the particular
achievements
of each officer can be
enumerated
,
which decency forbids, and which
indeed, cannot be done in the limits of
one harangue. Leaving, therefore,
ourselves
,
and
these
scenes
, wholly out of
the
question
, let us
speak
a little of
those
whom we left behind. But why need we
speak
; for all time will
speak
of them.
The bards that
shall
live, will draw hence
their
choicest
allusions
.
Consider
them,
indeed, as more happy than you,
because
they
ascended
from among the group of
their companions, who were at that time
instant
witnesses
of their achievments. The
warriors who fall in battle, are the
most
glorious
subjects
of panegyric. Hector and
Achilles, form the
most
splendid
part of the
song
of Homer, and in a great degree,
because
their bodies were interred in the
presence
of the two armies. Oh what a noble
object! an army mourning a brave officer,
and tears drawn even from the foe,
struck
with the
sublime
of his
personal
prowess
,
and excellent knowledge of the military art.
Much unlike, and far above
those
who
languish
with
sickness
on a bed in calm life,
where relations
standing
round,
wish
the
departure of the
shade
, and gape for the
possession
which he leaves behind. But
the fame of a
soldier
none but
himself
can
enjoy, there can be no heir or
devisee
of
his property. It is his own, and it mounts
with him. His blood only remains to
bless
the earth, from which flowers and
roses
spring
, and clothe the woods and
groves with enchantment and delight. For
here the
song
of
poesy
is awakened, and at
morn, and noon, and at
still
eve, they are
heard who
rehearse
where the brave fell,
and where they
sleep
. Sublime
spirits
!
whether you inhabit the Pagan
elysium
or the
Christian
heaven, you are happy;
and
listen
to
those
immortal lyres which
are
strung
to the deeds of heroes.
So much for the exordium of the
oration
;
it was all he had yet written. The
evening
passed
away in hilarity; and the
conversation
turned again on the Cincinnati
order; but particularly what may be
called
the arms of the
institution
, viz.
Britannia
represented
as a fine woman, with
her
bosom
bare, affrighted; and
Cincinnatus
,
an accoutred knight, attacking her
thus unarmed, as St. George did the
dragon
;
the eagle, the bird of Jove, in the
mean time
grasping
the lightning in his
claws, an image that would
seem
unnatural
:
Whereas the eagle might be
represented
in the clouds near Jove, where the
lightning might be left to work its forked
course
, without the handing of the eagle;
and in the other figure, Cincinnatus might
raise
his lance
against
the lion that
supports
the crown, not
against
the
goddess
of the
island
.
From
these
strictures
which the Captain,
without pretending to be a
connoisseur
,
made, the
transition
was
easy
to a
criticism
on the motto of the badge; viz.
Omnia reliquit,
servare
, rempublicam.
The
infinitive is here
used
instead
of the
gerund
,
with the
preposition
,
ad
servandam
;
as if it was intended to
express
his motion,
or change of place, and not the object.
But in fact, the motto does not at all
express
that in which the merit of
Cincinnatus
did
consist
. It was not in his leaving
every thing to accept the
commission
of
the Roman
senate
; but in
resigning
his
commission
, and, the work done, going to
his plough again. His
praise
would have
been
expressed
better by the
phrase
of,
Victor ad aratrum redit.
In fact, it
cannot
apply well to our army;
most
of our
officers not having much to leave when
they accepted their
commissions
; but
discovered
a Cincinnati-like
disposition
, in
returning
after war to the employments of
civil life. It is true, there would have
been
less
tinsel
, and more bullion, in the
patriotism
of retiring without a badge, as
Cincinnatus did: But it is a thing that can
do little harm, and it is
pleasing
to indulge
a whim.
It may
doubtless
be
said
, that there were
officers that left the plough, and fought,
and returned to it, as well as
those
who
are within the limitations of the
institution
,
and entitled to a badge; that, troops
who had
served
a
short
enlistment
, and
militia
persons
, at
least
those
who fought
a little, were not wholly
destitute
of
some
claim to the badge of merit. Even
those
who
lost
property might be
said
to
suffer
,
and advance
pretensions
to the reward of
honour. Not that all of them
should
claim
gold medals, or even
silver
; but
some
brass
,
some
copper, pewter, a bit of tin,
or pot metal,
just
as the
specific
value of
their
services
might entitle them.
Perhaps
while
some
wore it at the
breast
,
others
N
might be enjoined to war it at the
breeches pocket, and thus, as well by the
point from which appendant, as by the bob
itself
,
designate
the proportion of their
honour.
After this,
some
things were
said
on the
subject
of introducing honourary
members
;
against
which the Captain declared
himself
: That every thing ought to be
preserved
sui
generis;
as nature makes no
honourary animals; but all are of the
species
,
or take not the name: a bear is a
real bear, a
sheep
is a
sheep
; and there is
no commixture of name, where there is
a difference of nature. But it did not
appear
to be of any great
consequence
, one
way or the other. For the order would
never come to any great head, as there
was no
opposition
given. For this is
necessary
to keep alive attachment to what is
arbitrary, and founded, not in utility, but
caprice. For as the fire dies without air,
so
whim without contradiction.
The officer was a man of liberality and
good
sense
, and acknowledged the truth
of this. But the evening being now far
spent
, candles were called for, and they
went to bed.
POSTSCRIPT.
THE preceding pages were written
several
years ago; during which time
the Captain has continued his travels: and
having been favoured with his journal,
I have
occasionally
made extracts, and put
them in the form of a continued
history
.
Whether I
shall
publish
any more, will
depend on the reception of this.
I had
first
begun this work in
verse
,
and have a volume by me, about two parts
in three as large as Butler's
Hudibrass
;
from which
composition
, I have extracted
this; thinking it might be more acceptable
in
prose
. When I
visit
this city next, I may
produce that in
verse
, and let the people
take their choice.
It is a
happiness
to a man to be
able
to
amuse
himself
with writing. For
it is not every one that can play upon
the violin, or the flute; and the
fingers
must
be employed
some
way. I
may be blamed in not
chusing
some
subject
worthier of my
studies
, and requiring
a profound
research
. It might profit the
world more; but it would
amuse
myself
less
.
Omnis labor improbus;
all toil is
grievous. However, I have not been
wholly inattentive to
severer
studies
. I
have
several
law tracts by me; for which
I mean, in due time, to
solicit
a
subscription
.
Nonum prematur in annum,
in every
work of moment, ought to be
observed
.
There are
some
light things which I
may in the mean time throw out; a
comparison
of Thucydides with Livy; thoughts
on the Egyptian hieroglyphics; on the
Carthaginian commerce; a
comparison
of the French and
English
eloquence; a
supplement
to Buffon, containing a
description
of
several
genera of animals, not
taken notice of by him; hints for the
improvement
of the
microscope
; on the
use
of the
Masoretic
points; on the recent
origin of the earth; on the criminal code
of the
Siamese
, &c.
If the world will
excuse
these
, I will give
them my word for it, they
shall
be
troubled
little more; for except the examining
my law tracts, I
shall
drop my pen,
finding
it, as I advance in life, more
adviseable
to apply
myself
to making money. What
things have been written, and are now
lying by me, may
occasionally
see
the
light.
It is a good deal owing to my
solitary
residence
in the
western
country, at a
distance
from books and literary
conversation
,
that I have been led to write at all.
It was
necessary
to fill up the
interstices
of
business
. If I
should
remain in that
country, the
same
circumstances
may lead
me to write
still
. If I
should
remove to
this city, or the
seat
of the federal
government
,
I
shall
avoid the tedium by other
means.
I
wish
the
present
book, to
sell
for at
least
as much as will defray the expence
of printing; for I have no inclination to
lose
by it. If I had a little time to
stay
in town, I could give it
some
celebrity by
extracts, and remarks upon it;
publishing
for and
against
. For it is of no
consequence
how a book is made famous, provided that
it is famous.
The truth is, as I have
said
, I value this
book for little but the
stile
. This I have
formed on the model of Xenophen, and
Swift's Tale of a Tub, and Gulliver's
Travels
.
It is
simple
, natural, various, and
forcible. I hope to
see
it made a
school
book; a kind of
classic
of the
English
language.
In looking over it, I find in the whole
work, but one word I would alter; it
is near the beginning; where I
say
figure
on the
stage
,
instead
of appear, or
make a figure on the
stage
. I have
carefully
avoided the word
unfounded
instead
of
groundless
, a word in vogue, among
members
of
Congress
especially
. The word
commit,
is good, but being lately
introduced
,
and too much hackneyed, I have
not
used
it.
Language being the
vestment
of thought,
it comes within the rules of other
dress
;
so
that as
slovenliness
, on the one hand,
or foppery, on the other, is to be avoided
in our attire;
so
also
in our
speech
, and
writing. Simplicity in the one and the
other, is the
greatest
beauty.
We do not know at what time the Greek
language began to be written as it was by
Hesiod
or Homer. But we find it to have
continued with little or no change, from
that time to the
latest
writers among the
Byzantine
historians
, a period of more
than 3000 years. The Roman language
is
considered
as improving from the time
of Ennius to the
Augustine
age. The
language
of the orators, poets, and
historians
of that time is the
standard
. It was not
so
much in the
use
of particular words, as
an affectation in the thought, that
Seneca
is
censured
as corrupting the
language
of the Romans. But Tacitus, after
him, writes in a pure
stile
; and I have
found but one conceit in
expression
, in his
whole
history
: meaning to give the
geography
of a country of a certain tribe of
the Germans; they are,
says
he,
separated
from the Sequani by mount Jura, from
the  by the lake , from the
by the river , and from the Atabani
by
mutual fear.
I do not find
so
much
fault with the
stile
of Pliny, as the
heaviness
of his thoughts and
expressions
.
However
,
the Latin
stile
of writing retained its
propriety and other excellencies tolerably
well, till the monks got
possession
of it,
and brought it down to a jargon that is
now exploded; and we recur to the pure
originals of Horace, Virgil, Cicero, and
Sallust
.
The French language is corrupting
fast
;
and not in the
use
of words, but in the
affectation of
surprise
, in the
structure
of
the
sentence
, or the turn of the
expression
.
Mirabeau was free from this; but
not the Abbe Raynal. To give an
example
:
meaning to
say
, which he might have
done in a
simple
manner, that about this
time the
English
cast
their eyes upon Goa,
as a place where, &c.
stating
the
advantages
of
such
a port; he begins by telling
you, that the
English
had
occasion
for
such
a port, which, &c. enumerating the
advantages
;
and after this, with
surprize
comes upon you, and tells you, they
wanted
Goa. Enfin,
says
he; that is, in fine
they wanted Goa.
The
English
language is undoubtedly
written better in America than in England,
especially
since
the time of that literary
dunce, Samuel
Johnson
, who was totally
destitute
of
taste
for the
vrai naturalle,
or
simplicity
of nature.
The language of the Scots writers is
chaste
, but the
structure
of the
sentence
of the academic Dr.
Robertson
,
especially
offends in this particular; his
uniformity
of period
striking
the ear with
the
same
pulse
, as the couplets of our
rhyme in Dryden and Pope. Hume is
before him in this
respect
, writing as
naturally
as a man
speaks
; his
stile
rising
and falling with the
subject
, as the
movements
of the mind
themselves
.
I am quite out of patience with this
postscript
.
I have written it, the Printer
informing
me that he had a few pages of the
last
sheet
to fill, which
must
be left blank
unless
I had
something
more; but as I am in a
hurry about
some
small
matters, and have no
disposition
to write, I believe I
shall
conclude
,
and let him leave the remainder
blank, or put in a paragraph of his own,
if he
chuses
it.
It
just
strikes
me to add, that I am this
moment come from being admitted a
Counsellor
in the
supreme
court of the United
States; having written the preceding part
of this
postscript
just
before the court
sat
.
In
consequence
of my
admission
in this
honourable court, I feel
myself
inspired
with a
consciousness
of new dignity, and
am determined to
relinquish
the
indulgence
of all
these
light
amusements
, and
apply
myself
for the future to fathom the
profound depths of the legal oceans and
rivers.

BOOK I.
CHAP. I.
RISING early next morning, the
Captain
proceeded, with his man Teague,
on his journey, and having
breakfasted
at
an inn, where nothing material
happened
,
we
shall
pass
it over, and come as far
down in the day as eleven o'clock; tho',
by the bye, it might have been more
correct
to have
said
up in the day,
because
the
sun
rises
until twelve o'clock, and then
descends
: But waving this nicety, we
shall
go on to relate what actually took place.
A man was
seen
before them, driving,
leisurely
, a
horse
with two kegs upon his
back. The Captain took him for what is
called a pack-
horse
man, that was
carrying
salt
or
sugar
to
some
place of market.
A man of a
philosophic
turn of mind
never
hesitates
to enter into
conversation
with any character;
because
human
nature
is the field whence he gathers thoughts
and
expressions
. The Captain therefore
accosting
this man,
said
, Is it
salt
or
molasses
you have in your kegs, countryman?
You are going home from
some
store
, I
suppose
, where you have
purchased
; or
going to
set
up a
small
store
of your own,
and vend goods. No,
said
the man,
with a Scotch-
Irish
pronunciation, there is
an election this day a little way before us,
and I am
setting
up for the
legislature
, and
have
these
two kegs of
whisky
to give a
dram to the voters. The Captain was
thrown into a reverie of thought, and
began to reflect with
himself
on the
nature
of a republican government, where
canvassing
by
such
means as this, can work
so
great an evil as to elevate the
most
unqualified
persons
to the
highest
deliberative
assemblies
. But, in the mean time,
roused
a little from his thought, he had
presence
of mind to recollect the danger
in which he was about to be involved
afresh
with his man Teague; whom, now
looking round, he
saw
to be about forty
yards behind him. It would have been
adviseable
to have diverted from the road,
and taken a circuitous rout, to avoid the
election ground. But as the devil, or
some
worse
being, would have it, it was
a lane in which they were, with a fence
on each
side
;
so
that he could not divert
without leaping like a fox hunter, or one
of your light-
horse
men, to which the
sober
nag on which he rode was not
competent
.
Besides
, if Teague did not leap
after
him he would be left
exposed
in the
lane to the populace, who might
solicit
him to be their
representative
. To turn
directly back would appear indecorous,
and
unless
he could drive Teague on
before
him, which was not
customary
, and
to which he might not, all at once
submit
,
his
station
would of
course
be the rear,
where he might be picked up as a
straggler
,
and
sent
to
some
public body.
In this quandary of thought, looking up,
he
saw
the breakers
just
a-head; that is,
the people met for the
purpose
of
electing
,
and that it was now
impossible
to
avoid
them. Depending, therefore, on his
own
address
, to make the
best
of
circumstances
,
he
suffered
himself
to be carried
along towards them, keeping, in the mean
time, an eye upon Teague, who was the
cause
of his concern.
Meeting accidentally with a Scotch
gentleman
on the ground, whom he knew, he
communicated to him the delicacy of his
situation
, and the
apprehensions
he had on
the part of Teague. Said the Scotch
gentleman
,
Ye need na gie your
sel
any
trouble
on that head, man; for I
sal
warrant
the man wi the twa kegs will carry the
elaction: there is na
resisting
guid liquor;
it has an unco effec on the judgment in
the choice of a
representative
. The man
that has a
distillery
or twa in our country,
canna want
suffrages
. He has his votaries
about him like ane o' the Heathen gods,
and
because
the fluid exhilerates the brain,
they think he maun be a deity that makes
it; and they fa' down,
especially
when
they have drank ower muckle, and
worship
him,
just
as at the
shrine
of Apollo
or Bacchus, among the ancients.
The candidate that
opposed
the man of
the two kegs, was a
person
of gravity and
years, and
said
to be of good
sense
and
experience
in facts. The judgment of the
people was in his favour, but their appetite
leaned
against
him.
There is a
story
of one Manlius, a
Roman
,
A 2
who had
saved
the capitol from the
Gauls, by putting his
breast
to the
rampart
,
and throwing them down as they
ascended
.
When this man afterwards,
elated
with the honours paid him, forgot the
duties of a citizen,
wishing
to
subvert
the
republic, by
usurping
the power of a
tyrant
,
the people, jealous of liberty, were
incensed
; and being convicted of the crime,
he was dragged to
punishment
. It was not
the way, at that time, to hang, as you
would a dog; or behead, as you would
a wild
beast
: but to throw from a high
rock, which they called the Tarpeian. The
capitol was
just
in view, and while they
were dragging him along to the place, he
would
stretch
his hand to this; as much
as to
say
, There, O Romans, I
saved
you:
The populace at this would
stop
a while,
irresolute
whether to
desist
or drag him
on. While they recollected his offence,
they marched a
step
; but when they
cast
their eye on the capitol, they
stood
still
;
and not until
some
principal men
directed
the rout out of the view of the capitol,
could he be brought to
justice
.
So it was with the multitude convened
on this
occasion
, between the man with
the two kegs and the grave looking
person
.
When they looked on the one, they felt
an inclination to promote him. But when
again on the other hand, they
saw
two
kegs which they knew to be
replenished
with a very chearing liquor, they
seemed
to be inclined in favour of the other.
But appetite prevailed, and they gave
their votes in favour of the man with the
two kegs.
Teague in the mean time thinking he
had another chance of being a great man,
had been
busy
, but to no
purpose
; for the
people gave their votes to the man of the
two kegs. The Captain thought
himself
fortunate to be thus relieved, and
proceeded
on his journey.
CHAP. II.
Containing
Observations
.
THE perplexity of the Captain, in the
late
transaction
on account of his man
servant
, may
serve
to put
those
in mind
who travel with a waiter, not to go much
about at the election
seasons
, but avoid
them as you would the equinoxes. It
might not be
amiss
, if, for this
reason
the
times of electing members for the
several
bodies were put down in the almanac, that
a man might be
safe
in his
excursions
, and
not have an
understrapper
picked up when
he could not well
spare
him.
I mean this as no
burlesque
on the
present
generation; for mankind in all ages
have had the
same
propensity
to magnify
what was
small
, and elevate the low. We
do not find that the Egyptians, though there
were lions in the kingdom of Lybia, not far
distant
, ever made a god of one of them.
They rather
chose
the cow kind, the
stork
,
and the crocodile, or the
musk
-rat, or
miresnipe
,
or other inferior animal to deify.
The Romans, and the Greeks
also
, often
worshipped
small
matters. Indeed we do
not find
amongst
any nation, that the
elephant
,
or rhinoceros, or elk, or unicorn,
have been made tutelar divinities. As,
Cannons
shoot
the higher pitches,
The lower you put down their breeches.
The
smaller
the objects we take up, and
make them great, the act is the greater;
for it requires an equal art in the formation
of the
glass
to magnify, as to
diminish
,
and if the object is not of
itself
small
, there
is no magnifying. Caligula is celebrated
through all
history
for making his
horse
a
senator
. It would have been nothing to
have made a Roman knight one; but to
endow a mere quadruped with the
qualities
of a
legislator
,
bespeaks
great
strength
of parts and judgment.
CHAP. III.
IT was about three o'clock in the
afternoon
that the Captain came to an inn,
where
unhorseing
and
unsaddling
, Teague
took the
steed
, and the
master
went to
sleep
on a
sopha
in the
passage
.
Unless
it
is in a very deep
sleep
, the mind is in
some
degree awake, and has what are called
dreams.
These
are frequently
composed
of a recollection of late events.
Sometimes
the mind recovers incidents long
since
past
, and makes comments, but
most
usually
, out of mere indolence takes
up with what is next at hand. It
happened
so
on this
occasion
; for the Captain
thought
himself
still
engaged with the
Scotchman on the
subject
of the late
election
.
It
seemed
to him that he
said
, Mr.
M`Donald, for that was the name of the
Scotch gentleman, you do not
seem
to
have a high opinion of our republican form
of government, when the
most
indifferent
can obtain the people's
suffrages
.
The Scotchman
seemed
to
answer
in his
own dialect,
saying
, Ye are much
mistaken
man, if ye draw that
conclusion
. I think
there is a
worse
chance for merit to come
forth where appointments are in the hand
of one than when with many; for it is
much
easier
to
scratch
the rump of one,
than tickle the hurdies o' a
thousand
. Ye
see
our executives dinna do much better
in their appointments to judicial and
ministerial
offices, than the rabble folk
themselves
to the
legislative
. It all comes to
the
same
thing in every government; the
wind blaws, and the feathers and the fern
get
uppermost
.
At this
instant
he was awakened by a
bustle
out of doors. The fact was; a
disagreement
had taken place between Teague
and the
hostler
at the inn, about their
skill
respectively
in rubbing down and currying
horses
. Teague had made
use
of a
single
grab of hay, which he held with both
hands, and
impressed
the
horse
, rubbing
him from
side
to
side
, and up and down
with all his might. The other with a
wisp
in each hand, rubbed; the right hand
passing
to the left, while the left hand
passed
to the right, in a
transverse
or diagonal
direction. The
hostler
valued
himself
on
having been groom, as he pretended, to
some
nobleman in England, and therefore
most
be
supposed
to
understand
the true
art of currying. Teague maintained his
opinion, and way of working with a good
deal of
obstinacy
, until at
last
it came to
blows. The
first
stroke
was given by
Teague, who hit the
hostler
on the left
haunch with his foot, when he was
stooping
down to
shew
Teague how to rub the
fetlock. The
hostler
recovering, and
seizing
Teague by the
breast
,
pushed
him
back with a retrograde motion, until he
was brought up by a cheek of the
stable
door.
Resting
against
this, Teague made
a
sally
, and impelled his
antagonist
several
yards back, who finding at length behind
him the
support
of a
standing
trough where
the waggoners
used
to feed, recovered his
position
, and elanced Teague
some
distance
from the place of projection. But
Teague
still
keeping hold of the collar of
his
adversary
, had brought him along with
him, and both were now on the ground
struggling
for victory. But Teague
turning
on his belly, and drawing up his knees,
was making an effort to
raise
himself
to his
feet. The other in the mean time, partly
by the
same
means, and partly by
retaining
hold of the
Irishman
, was in the
attitude
of
rising
with him. They were now
both up, locked
fast
in the
grasp
of each
other, their heads inclining in conjunction,
but their feet apart, like
muskets
stacked
after a review, or like the arch of a bridge.
The head of each
supported
by the
abutment
of the feet. Few blows were given,
and therefore not much damage done. But
the
persons
present
calling out fair play,
and making a
bustle
in the porch of the
inn, had awakened the Captain, and bro't
him to the door, who
seeing
what was
going
on, took upon him to command the
peace; and the people
supposing
him to
be a
magistrate
,
assisted
to part the
combatants
;
when the Captain ordering both of
them before him, made enquiry into the
cause
of the
dispute
. Teague gave his
account
of the matter; adding, if he had
had a
shillelah
, he would have been after
making him know that the paple in dis
country, could curry a
horse
, or a cow,
or a
shape
, as well as any
Englishman
in de world, though he have been
hastler
to a great lord, or de king
himself
, at his
own
stable
where he has his
harse
.
Teague,
said
the Captain, this may be
true; but it was unbecoming a
philosopher
to attempt to
establish
this by blows.
Vol. II. B
Force proves nothing but the quantum of
the force.
Reason
is the only argument
that belongs to man. You have been the
aggressor
, and therefore in the power of
the law. But as to you, Mr.
Hostler
, you
have given
considerable
provocation. I
have had this lad with me
several
years,
and I
say
that he curries and rubs down a
horse
very well. It is no uncommon thing
for men of your country, to undervalue
other nations, or
those
retained by them.
You naturally
associate
your own
attainments
with the bulk and
populousness
of
your cities: But can the looking at a large
building, or a tall
spire
, add an inch to
your
stature
?
Because
Fox is eloquent, is
every one that hears him
so
too? Is not
human ingenuity, the
same
here as on the
other
side
of the water? Our generals have
fought as well, in the late war, as any
Clinton, or Cornwallis that you have. Our
politicians have wrote, and our patriots
have
spoke
as well as your Burkes, or your
Sheridans, or any other; and yet when
you come here, there is no bearing the
airs of
superiority
you take upon
yourselves
.
I wonder if the
wasps
, that are in
your garrets in London,
consider
themselves
better than the
wasps
that are in
these
woods? I
should
suppose
they
must
;
such
is the contemptible vanity of an
island
,
which, taking in its whole extent,
would be little more than a urinal to one
of our Patagonians in South America.
This the Captain
said
to mortify the
hostler
;
though, by the bye, there is a good deal
of truth in the
observation
, that the
people
of an old country undervalue the new;
and when they think of
themselves
, conjoin
the adventitious
circumstances
of all that
exists
where they have lived. I have found
a prejudice of this nature even with the
wisest
men. What wonder, therefore, that
a poor illiterate
hostler
should
be
subject
to it? But if he did undervalue an
American
born, yet he ought to have
considered
that Teague, though not born in
Britain
,
was born near it, and therefore
might
considerably
approach the
same
skill
in any handy-craft work.
In natural
history
, we do not value
animals
on account of the place from whence
they are taken, but on account of what
they are
themselves
; and in things that are
made by hands, not by the manufacturer,
but the quality. We prefer the trout of
the rivulet, to the mullet of the river;
and we judge of the pudding not by the
maker, but the eating. There is a
proverb
that
establishes
this; for proverbs are
the deductions of experience, and to which
we
assent
as
soon
as
expressed
; containing
in them an obvious truth, which the
simplest
understand
.
CHAP. IV.
IT is not for the
sake
of any moral,
that I have related this
scuffle
that took
place between the
Irishman
and the
hostler
;
but for the
sake
of
shewing
in what
manner incidents are to be related; that
is, with great
simplicity
of
stile
, and
minuteness
of
description
. That part of Livy
which contains the combat of the Horatii,
and Curatii, is frequently given to the
students
at a college to
translate
, that by this
means they may be taught to imitate the
like delicacy in the choice of words, and
particularity of the recital. The above
may
answer
the
same
purpose
. It is true
there is not the like incidents in this
combat
,
as in that
described
by Livy;
nevertheless
,
the
same
art is therein
discovered
, as
the
sound
critic will
observe
. I know it will
be thought by any one who reads it, that
he could
use
the very
same
words, and
give the
same
liveliness
of picture, were
B 2
he to attempt it. Should he try it, he
will find
himself
disappointed
.
Sudet
multum,
frustraque
laboret,
ausus
idem.
It may be thought, that though
stile
is
my object, yet I might now and then bring
along a thought to entertain the reader,
and introduce
some
subject
of moment,
rather than the
fisty
-cuffs of two
raggamuffins
.
I would
just
ask
this
question
;
Is not the talent of the
artist
shewn
as much
in painting a fly, as a waggon-wheel. If
this were intended as a book of morals,
or
physiology
, and not as a mere belles
lettres
composition
, there might be
something
said
;as the
case
is, critics
must
be
silent
.
BOOK II.
CHAP. I.
I SHALL
pass
over the
circumstances
of the Captain's dining, and Teague,
reconciled with the
hostler
, taking his
mess
in the kitchen; and go on to what befel
afterwards, when having
saddled
the
horse
,
they
set
out on their further perigrination.
Towards evening, when the
shadows
of
the trees began to be very long, the
Captain
bidding Teague trot along
side
,
addressed
him in the following words:
Teague,
said
he, it is true I am none of
your knight-errants, who
used
to ride about
the world relieving fair
damsels
, and
killing
giants, and lying out in woods, and
forests
, without a
house
, or even
forets">forests
, without a
house
, or even
tent-cloth
over their heads, to protect them
from the night air.
Nevertheless
, as in
some
respects
my equipment, and
sallying
forth
resembles
a knight-errant, and you a
squire
, would it be
amiss
,
just
for a
frolick
,
to ly out a night or two, that it might
be
said
that we have done the like. There
is no great danger of wolves or bears, for
while there are
sheep
, or pigs to be got
at, they will
shun
human
flesh
. It will
make a good chapter in our journal, to
describe
you lying at the foot of an oak
tree, and me with my head upon my
saddle
,
under another; the
horse
, in the mean
time, feeding at a
small
distance
. Teague
thought it would be an
easier
matter to
write down the chapter in the journal, than
ly under the trees to beget it. It is true,
said
the Captain, navigators and
travellers
,
make many a fiction; and
those
who
have been in battle have killed many, that
were killed by others, or have not been
killed at all. But it would ill become a
limb of chivalry to deviate from the truth.
It will be but about twelve hours
service
lying on our backs and looking up to the
stars
, hearing the howling of wolves, and
observing
the great bear in the heavens,
the means by which the Chaldeans, the
first
astronomers
, laid the foundation of
the
science
. Fait, and I tink,
said
Teague,
it would be better to be in a good
house
,
with a
shoulder
of mutton to ate before we
go to
slape
, than to have our own
shoulders
tarn by the bears, or
brused
by lying
under great oaks. Of what
use
is this
astranomy
?
did any of
these
astranamers
ever
shoot
down a bear in the firmament,
to get a joint of mate for a
sick
person
;
and what good comes of lying in de woods,
to be ate up by the
snakes
; but
severs
, and
agues, and
sore
troats, to get a long cough,
and die in a ditch like a dead
horse
, and
be nothing thought of, but be trown into
ridicule like a black-head that has no
sense
.
It is better to go to a
house
and get a bed
to
slape
in, and warm
shates
about us, than
be lying in the dew like a frag, crocking
the next day like one of
dase
, and get no
good by it.
The Captain had made the
proposition
merely to divert
himself
with Teague, and
so
did not
insist
upon it.
Riding one or two miles, the
sun
was
setting
, and a
house
appeared in view a
little
off the road. A lane led up to it with
a meadow on one
side
, and a
pasture
field
on the other. On this
last
, there were
cattle
of cows, and
sheep
grazing. The
house
in front, was a frame building,
respectable
in appearance, from the height, and
dimensions
,
but ancient. There was a
considerable
extent of clear ground around
it, and an orchard hard by, with at
least
five hundred apple-trees.
Having lodged chiefly at inns
since
his
first
setting
out, the Captain had the
curiosity
to
diversify
his travels, by lodging
at a private
house
this evening.
Accordingly
riding up to the door, and calling
out Halloa, which is the note of
interrogation
which is
used
when a man
wishes
the
master
or
mistress
of a family, or
some
one
of the
servants
, to come forth, to know
what he wants.
It happened that the
mistress
herself
came to the door, and
seeing
a good
looking
man, in a green old age,
sitting
on
horse
-back, with his
servant
ready to take
care of his
steed
should
he think proper
to
dismount
,
she
made a low
curtsey
, as
much as to
say
, Sir, I
should
be happy to
know, in what manner I can
serve
you.
Madam,
said
the Captain, to tell you
the truth, the night is drawing on, and I
have been reflecting with
myself
, whether
to lodge in the woods, or take a
house
.
All things
considered
, I have thought it
most
adviseable
to take a
house
, and the
only
question
that now remains is, whether
I can get one.
The lady
smiling
with much
complacency
,
and inclining her head forward, and
her middle back, replied, I
should
be
happy
,
Sir, if this
small
mansion
could afford
you an accomodation worthy of your
suite
.
Madam,
said
the Captain, I
shall
be
happy
if the
guest
can be worthy of the
accommodation
.
Alight, Sir,
said
the lady, we
shall
be
happy to receive you. Having alighted,
he was introduced to a very decent
apartment
,
where the lady
seating
herself
in a
large
cushioned
chair, and pulling out her
box, took a pinch of
snuff
, and laid the
box upon the
cushion
. She was a good
looking woman, being about fifty-
seven
years of age, with gray hairs, but a green
fillet on her left eye-brow, as it
seems
the
eye on that
side
was
subject
to a defluction
of rheum, which made it expedient
to-cover
it. It could not be
said
that her
teeth were bad,
because
she
had none. If
she
wanted the
rose
on her cheek,
she
had
it on her
nose
,
so
that it all came to the
same
thing. Nothing could be
said
against
her chin, but it
used
her mouth ill in
getting
above it. She was not very tall, but
what
she
wanted in height,
she
made up in
breadth;
so
that multiplying one
dimension
by the other,
she
might be
considered
as a
very
sizeable
woman. After
conversing
a
little while, the lady withdrew, to give
directions
in the kitchen what to provide
for
supper
.
The Captain in the mean time taking
up a pipe, which he
saw
on the
mantlepiece
,
amused
himself
with a whiff.
The old lady in the mean time was in
the kitchen, and the
first
thing
she
observed
was Teague, reclining in an angle of
the chimney
fast
asleep
.
Considering
him
inattentive to his
master
's
horse
which had
been
sent
to the
stable
,
she
desired
a
servant
to give him a jog, and wake him.
Teague, awaking,
saw
the old lady, and
bespoke
her. Dear madam, what a great
happiness
it is for poor
sharvants
to have
gentle folks about them? God
bless
your
anours
ladyship
; you are
just
for all the world
like my
cousin
Shala Shagney, the
honsomest
woman in all Ireland, and was
married
to Shan
Crossan
, who had a great
estate
,
and a flock of
shape
into the bargain.
She
used
to
say
to me when I was
aslape
,
Teague are you awake; and when I was
awake, Teague are you
aslape
, dear honey.
There is
something
in an
Irishman
which
has an admirable effect upon the fair;
whether
it is owing to that love creating
lustiness
of
person
, and
freshness
of complexion
which they
usually
possess
; or the delicacy
and quantum of the flattery of which they
are not niggardly; nor need they be
so
, no
persons
having a greater
stock
to come and
go upon. For
so
it was, that the language
of the bog trotter, had gained the good
will of this
same
Hecuba, and
she
ordered
him a tankard of metheglim, to make
himself
merry with the
servants
.
Returning to the parlour
she
continued
her
conversation
with the Captain; but her
mind running upon Teague
she
could not
avoid introducing his name, with a view
to learn
some
particulars of his
history
.
This is a civil young man,
said
she
, that
came with you, and of a
conversation
above
ordinary
persons
. The Captain
being
an
observer
of the
passions
of the
mind, as they
express
themselves
in the
eye and
aspect
,
saw
that Teague had made
some
impression
on the affections of this
goodly old maiden gentlewoman: Nor
was he
displeased
with it; for his
first
alarm
was, that
she
would have
fastened
on
himself
; but her
passion
taking this
Vol. II. C
course
, would be
less
troublesome
.
Framing
his
answers
therefore to her
questions
,
with a view to favour what had
so
fortunately
commenced, he gave her to
understand
,
that, though in the
disguise
of
a
servant
, Teague was no
inconsiderable
personage
; that he had been a member
of
Congress
one or two years; though,
by the bye, this was
stretching
the matter
a little, as he had only had it in his power
to be one. But if it is allowable to
strain
a point at all, it is in the
recommendation
of one who
stands
well enough
already
;
for not being taken on the
recommendation
,
there is no deception; and it
is but civility to make one more
pleased
with their choice, than they already are.
The Captain
said
nothing of his having
preached, or being about to preach; for
the idea of
sermons
, and
catechisms
,
impressing
the mind with religious awe, is
unfavourable to love. As to his being a
member of the
philosophical
society
, it
could be neither here nor there with a
lady
,
and therefore he was
silent
with
respect
to this
also
.
Supper being brought in, they
sat
down;
but little
conversation
passed
; the mind
of the enamorata being more in the
kitchen
than in the parlour. After
supper
, the
Captain
sitting
sometime
, and
seeming
drowsy
, was
asked
by his
hostess
, if he
chose
to go to bed:
Answering
in the
affirmative, a
servant
waited with a
candle
;
and bidding her good night, he was
lighted to his chamber.
No
sooner
had he withdrawn, but the
old lady
sent
her compliments to Teague,
to take a
seat
in the parlour; where
sitting
down to a
roasted
duck,
just
brought in,
a few
slices
of gammon on a plate, a piece
of veal, and a couple of
roasted
potatoes,
he was
desired
to partake: the old lady
casting
amourous looks at him, in the
mean time. I
say
looks; for though
she
had but one eye to look with, yet
looking often,
she
might be
said
to
cast
looks. It was a new thing to the
Irishman
,
to be at a table with a
servant
at
his back; and he began now to think that
fortune meant to do him
justice
: and with
an
ease
, and
self
-
possession
, which
some
would call affrontery, he did the honours
of the table; helping
himself
, and
talking
as
fast
as
consisted
with his
disposition
to
satisfy
his appetite. May it
please
your
ladyship
,
said
he, I am a poor
sharvant
now, but I have
seen
the time, when I
have ate at as good a table as the Captain
my
master
, though he rides upon a
horse
and I trot on foot. My uncle, by the
mother's
side
, Shan O'Gan, had a deer
park, and kept race-
horses
, to go to de
fair, and the city of Cork; and my
father's
brother, Phelim O'Regan, was a
justice
of the pace, and hung paple for
staleing
shape
. I might have been a
member
of parliament, if I had
staid
at home
and went to
school
; but
sending
a
challenge
,
and fighting wid my own dear
cousin
Denis O'Conelly, I had to fly de
kingdom
,
and brought noting wid me but my
brogs, and ten guineas in my
purse
; and
am now noting but a poor
sharvant
,
unless
your
ladyship
would take pity upon me,
and marry me; for I am wary of this way
of tratting after a crazy Captain, that has
no
sense
to curry his own
harse
; and I
have to fight duels for him, and keep him
from being knocked down like a brute
baste
; for dis very day, when he had a
quarrel wid a
hastler
, and was trown
upon
his back, I lifted him up, and
said
,
Dear honey, are you dead? took de
hastler
by de troat, and choaked him, and he
could not
spake
, but
said
, Dear
shentlemen
,
spare
my life;
so
dat if your
ladyship
will take me to
yourself
, I will
stay
wid you, and take care of de
harses
, and
cows, and de
shape
, and plant parates, and
slape
wid you, and
ask
not a farthing, but
your own
sweat
self
into de bargain; for
you are de beauty of de world; and
fasting
or
slaping
, I could take you to my
arms, dear crature, and be happy wid
you.
The lady was by this time entirely won,
and gave him to
understand
, that in the
morning, after
consulting
a friend or two,
the marriage might be celebrated.
I give only a
sketch
of the
courtship
that
took place, for a great deal was
said
; and
it was near midnight before the lovers
could prevail upon
themselves
to part;
when Teague was lighted to his bed, and
had as good as that in which the Captain
slept
, which was a new thing to him;
being
accustomed
to pig in with
hostlers
and
servants
, at the places where they lodged.
The Captain was up early in the
morning
,
and
astonished
not to find Teague
stiring
,
but enquiring of the
servants
where
Teague
slept
, he was
shewn
up a pair of
stairs
, which he
ascended
, thinking he
had one or two more to
ascend
before he
reached the garret. But what was his
astonishment
,
C 2
when he was
shewn
into a
room on the
second
floor, where he found
Teague
snoring
on a feather bed with
curtains. Waking him, Teague;
said
he,
this goes beyond all your former
impudence
;
to crawl up out of the kitchen, and
get into a feather bed.
Please
your anour,
said
Teague, to ring a bell, and call up a
sharvant
, to bring boots, and
slippers
; for
I am to be married dis marning.
The Captain was thunder-
struck
; and
comprehending the whole of what had
taken
place,
saw
his
faux pas
in
recommending
him to the
hostess
; and now it only
remained, to cure the blunder he had
made, if it was at all curable.
We are
short
sighted
mortals; and while
we
stop
one leak, the water
rushes
in at
another. The very means that we
use
to
save
ourselves
from one evil, leads us to a
worse
. The Captain had need on this
occasion
of all his
address
.
Composing
himself
, he
dissembled
, and
spoke
as
follows
:
Teague,
said
he, will you that are a
young man, and have great
prospects
before
you,
consign
yourself
to the arms of an
old woman. Her breath will kill you in
the
course
of a fortnight. The fact is,
she
is a witch, and
inchantress
;
she
made the
same
proposition
to me
last
night, of
marrying
me; but I declined it. The world
is full of
these
sort
of cattle. There was
one
Shagnesa
Circe, in old times, that
used
to gather all
she
could into her net,
and transform them into hogs. Sir Teague
Ulysses
was the only one that had the
sense
to keep clear of her
music
, and avoid her.
Did you
see
that drove of hogs before the
door, when we rode up
last
evening. They
are nothing more than
stragglers
which
she
has transformed into
swine
. I did not
sleep
a wink
last
night, thinking of the danger
to which you were
exposed
, and indeed I
expected nothing
less
, than to find you
this morning a barrow, fattened up for a
feast
, a day or two hence. Did you think
such
an old haridan as this can have any
natural
concupiscence
for a man; or if
she
has, it is for a few days only, until
she
can
make him fit for
slaughter
. Then by
throwing
a little water on him, or by the bare
blowing of her breath,
she
makes a
beefcow
,
or hog-meat of him, and he finds the
knife at his throat, and
scalding
water
taking
off his
bristles
, and his guts out, and
is into the pickling-tub before he knows
what he is about. Do you think, Teague,
that I have read books for nothing? Have
you not
seen
me in my
study
, morning
and night, looking over Greek, and
Hebrew
letters, like partridge tracks? All
this to find out what was going on up and
down the world. Many a
history
of witches,
and conjurers, I have read, and know
them when I
see
them,
just
as I would my
own
sheep
, when I am at home. Better
indeed, for
unless
my
sheep
are marked, I
could not know them; but marked or not
marked, I know witches; and if I am not
mistaken
, this is the
greatest
witch that
ever
run. She was all night in my room,
in the
shape
of a cat. It is God's mercy,
that
she
had not changed
herself
into an
alligator, and eat you up before the
morning
.
When I came into the room I
expected
to find nothing
else
but bones, and
particles of hair, the remnant of her
repast
;
but it
seems
she
has thought you not
fat enough, and has given you a day or
two to run, to improve your
flesh
, and
take the
salt
better. The
worst
thing,
after
transformation, is the having you cut,
in order to make you fatter and better
pork, which is generally done the
first
day; and
castration
is a painful
operation
,
besides
the
loss
of the part. I have
had
several
of my acquaintances
served
in
this manner, falling in with old women
whom they took for fortunes; but were
in reality witches, and had dealings with
the devil.
Teague by this time was out of bed, and
had
dressed
himself
in his overalls and
short
coat, and was ready for a march. Indeed
he
wished
to
escape
as
soon
as
possible
;
and
descending
the
stairs
, going to the
stable
, and
saddling
the
horse
, they both
set
out, without taking leave. It was in
this manner Eneas quitted Dido, and got
a
ship
-board, before
she
was awake; and
the only difference was, that Teague had
left no little Iulus in the hall, to put her
in mind of the father.
CHAP. II.
TRAVELLING along, the Captain
could not but
observe
to Teague, the
injudicious choice he was about to make,
even had the woman not been a
necromancer
.
For the man who
surrenders
himself
to the arms of a
superannuated
female
,
for the
sake
of fortune, acts a part
not
less
unworthy and
disgraceful
, than the
prostitute
who does the
same
for half a
crown. While a man has the
use
of his
limbs and arms, he ought to be above
such
mercenary motives; and true
happiness
can be found only in congruity, and what
is natural. Teague
seemed
still
to have
some
hankering after the
supper
of ducks,
and the feather bed; but as they
proceeded
,
the recollection became more faint,
for
distance
and time, is the cure of all
passions
.
BOOK III.
CHAP. I.
PROCEEDING four or five miles,
they
breakfasted
; and afterwards,
going
on a mile or two further, they came
to a church where a number of people
were convened, to hear the
decision
of an
ecclesiastical
consistory
, met there on an
affair which came before them. It was
this: Two men appeared, the one of a
grave
aspect
, with a black coat; the other
without the
same
clerical colour of garb;
but with papers in his pocket which
announced
his authority to preach, and
officiatate
as a clergyman. The man with
the black coat, averred, that coming over
together, in a
vessel
from Ireland, they
had been
messmates
; and while he was
asleep
one night, being
drowsy
after
prayers
,
the other had
stolen
his credentials
from his pocket. The man in
possession
of the papers, averred they were his own,
and that the other had taken his coat, and
by advantage of the cloth, thought to
pass
for what he was not.
The
consistory
found it difficult, without
the aid of
inspiration
, to decide; and that
faculty having now
ceased
, there were no
other means, that they could
see
, to bring
the truth to light.
The Captain being informed of this
perplexity
,
could not avoid
stepping
up, and
addressing
them as follows: Gentlemen,
said
he, there is a text in your own
Scripture
,
which, I think, might enable you to
decide: It is this,
by their fruits you
shall
know them.
Let the two men preach;
and the
best
sermon
take the
purse
; or
laying
aside
the figure, let him that expounds
the
scripture
best
, be adjudged the
clergyman
.
The
proposition
seemed
reasonable
, and
was adopted; the competitors being
desired
to withdraw a little, and conn over their
notes, that they might be ready to deliver
a
discourse
respectively
.
The Captain
observing
the countenance
of him in
possession
of the papers, was
sensible
,
from his
paleness
, and dejection of
aspect
,
that he was the
impostor
. Going out
therefore
shortly
after, and falling in with
him, as he walked in a melancholy mood,
at a little
distance
from the church,
said
he
to him, I perceive how it is, that the other
is the preacher;
nevertheless
I would
wish
to
assist
you, and as I have been the means
of bringing you into this predicament, I
should
be
disposed
to bring you out.Let
me know how the
case
really
stands
.
The other candidly acknowledged that
having been a yarn-merchant in Ireland,
his capital had failed, and he had thought
proper to embark for this country; and
coming over with this clergyman, he had
purloined his papers; and would have
taken
his coat, had it not been too little for
him; a thing which never
struck
the
ecclesiastical
tribunal. But the matter being
now reduced to an actual experiment of
talents
,
he was at a
loss
; for he had never
preached a
sermon
in his life. It was true,
he had heard
sermons
and lectures in
abundance
;
and had he been
suffered
to go
on and preach at his
leisure
amongst
the
country people
first
, he might have done
well enough; but to make his
first
essay
in the
presence
of a learned body of the
Vol. II. D
clergy, would hazard a detection; but
now he
saw
his
oversight
in not having
taken
the notes of the other, at the
same
time he took the vouchers of his
mission
.
The Captain encouraged him, by
observing
,
that there were few bodies,
ecclesiastical
or civil, in which there were more than
one or two men of
sense
; that the
majority
of this
consistory
, might be as
easily
humbugged, as the lay people; that a good
deal would depend on the text that he took;
some
were
easily
preached upon; others
more difficult. An
historical
passage
about
Nimrod, or Nebuchadnezzar, or Sihon,
king of the Amorites, or Og, king of
Bashan
; out of
Genesis
, or Deuteronomy,
or the book of Judges, or Kings, would
do very well; but that he
should
avoid
carefully the book of Job, and the
Psalms
of David, and the Proverbs of Solomon;
these
requiring a
considerable
theological
knowledge; or, at
least
, moral
discussion
and reflection. Keep a good heart,
said
he, and attempt the matter. The
issue
may be better than you apprehend.
With this, taking him a little further to
the one
side
, where his
horse
was tied, he
took out a bottle from his
saddle
-bags, with
a little
whisky
in it, which Teague had put
there, and gave him a dram. This had a
good effect, and
raised
his
spirits
, and he
seemed
now ready to enter the
lists
with
his
antagonist
.
The other, in the mean time, had gone
in, and was ready, when called upon, to
hold forth. The man with the papers
returning
,
with the Captain not far behind,
took his
seat
. The board
signified
, that
one or other might
ascend
the pulpit. The
credential man,
wishing
to gain time, to
think farther what he was about to
say
,
but affecting
politeness
, yielded
precedence
to the other, and
desired
him to
preach
first
. Accordingly
stepping
up, he
took his text and began.
CHAP. III.
The Sermon.
Prov. viii. 33.
Hear
instruction
and be
wise
,
and
refuse
it not.
INSISTING on
these
words, I
shall
enquire, 1. Whence it is that men are
averse
to
instruction
. 2. The
misfortune
of this
disposition
.
Lastly
,
Conclude
with inferences from the
subject
.
1.
Whence it is that men are
adverse
to
instruction
.
The
first
principle is
indolence.
The mind loves
ease
, and does not
wish
to
be at the trouble of thinking. It is hard
to collect ideas, and
still
harder to
compose
them; it is like rowing a boat: whereas,
acting without thought, is like
sailing
before
the wind, and the tide in our favour.
The
second
principle is
pride.
It wounds
the
self
love of men, to
suppose
that they
need
instruction
. We
resent
more the
being called fools than knaves. No man
will own
himself
weak and uninformed.
In fact, he has not humility to think he
is: or, if he
should
be
conscious
of a want
of knowledge, he is unwilling that others
should
have the
same
opinion: and he will
not
submit
to be
instructed
, as that would
imply that he is not already
so
.
The third principle is
passion
.
When
we are
disposed
to
satisfy
the
desires
of
the
constitution
, or the affections of the
mind, which are unlawful, we do not
wish
to hear
dissuasion
from the indulgence.
The lecture comes to torment before the
time, when the
consequence
must
afflict.
Under the
second
head, we
shall
shew
the misfortune of this
disposition
.
It is what,
in early life, begins to fix the difference of
persons
. The hearer of
instruction
, even
with more moderate parts, becomes the
more
sensible
boy. The hearer of
instruction
has a better chance for life and
mature
years. Into how many dangers do
young
persons
run; leaping, climbing,
running, playing truant, and neglecting
books? Into what affrays too will
passions
prompt them, when they begin to feel the
sinew
strong
, and the manly nerve braced?
They value corporeal
strength
, which they
D 2
have in common with the
horse
, or the ox,
and neglect the cultivation of the mind,
which is the glory of our nature. What
is a man without information? In form
only above a
beast
. What is a man,
negligent
of moral duty?
Worse
than a
beast
;
because
, he is
destitute
of that by
which he might be governed, and of which
his nature is capable; and without which,
he is more dangerous, in proportion as he
is more ingenious.
I
shall
conclude with
inferences
from the
subject
.
It may be
seen
hence, with what
attention
we ought to hear, and with what
observation
,
see
. The five
senses
are the
avenues
of knowledge; but the reflection of
the mind on ideas
presented
, is the
source
of
wisdom
.
Understanding
is better than
riches; for
understanding
leads to
compotcency
,
and to know how to
use
it.
Laying
aside
, therefore, all indolence, pride,
and
passion
, let us hear
instruction
, and
be
wise
, and
refuse
it not.
This, reverend brethren, is a
short
sermon
.
It is one in miniature; like the
model
of a mechanical invention, which is
complete in its parts, and from whence
may be
seen
the powers of the inventor.
I did not intend to take up your time with
a long
discourse
;
because
,
ex pede
Herculem
;
you may know what I can do by
this
essay
.
The fact is, I am regularly bred, and
licensed
; but this my competitor, is no
more than a yarn merchant; who, failing
in his trade, has adventured to this
country
:
And coming over in the
vessel
with
me, took the opportunity one night, when
I was
asleep
, and picked my fob of
these
papers, which he now
shews
.
Thus having
spoke
, he
descended
.
The other, in the mean time, had been
at his wits end what to do. The
technical
difficulty of taking a text, and
dividing
it under
several
heads, and
splitting
each head into branches, and
pursuing
each with
such
strickness
, that the thoughts
should
be ranged under each which
belonged
to it, as exactly as you would
the
coarser
yarn with the
coarser
, and
the finer with the finer; or put balls with
balls, and hanks with hanks. At
last
he
had determined to take no text at all; as
it was much better to take none, than to
take one and not
stick
to it.
Accordingly
,
he
resolved
to preach up and down
the
scripture
, wherever he could get a
word of
seasonable
doctrine. Mounting the
pulpit, therefore, he began as follows:
The
first
man that we read of was
Adam
,
and
first
woman Eve:
she
was
tempted
by the
serpent
, and eat the forbidden
fruit. After this
she
conceived and bare
a
son
, and called his name Cain; and
Cain was a tiller of the ground, and Abel
a keeper of
sheep
; for
she
conceived and
bare a
second
son
, and called his name
Abel. And Cain
slew
Abel. There were
several
generations unto the flood, when
Noah built an ark, and
saved
himself
and
his family. After the flood, Abraham
begat
Isaac
, and
Isaac
begat Jacob, and
Jacob
begat
Joseph
and his brethren.
Potiphar's
wife, in Egypt, took a fancy for
Joseph
, and
cast
him in ward; and
Potiphar
was a captain of Pharaoh's guards;
and
Joseph
interpreted Pharaoh's dream
of the lean cattle; and there were twelve
years famine in the land; and
Moses
passed
for the
son
of Pharaoh's daughter,
and married Jethro's daughter, in the land
of Midian, and brought the
Israelites
out
of the land of Egypt; and
Joshua
the
son
of Nun, and Caleb the
son
Jephunneh;
and the walls of Jericho fell down at the
sound
of ram's horns; and
Sampson
slew
a
thousand
with the jaw-bone of an
ass
;
and Delilah the harlot; and Gideon, and
Barak, and Jephthah, and Abinoam the
Giliaditish
; and Samuel, and Saul, and
the prophets; and Jonathan, and David;
and Solomon built him an
house
; and
silver
was plenty as the
street
stones
in
Jerusalem
;
Rehoboam, and
Jehosophat
, and
the kings of
Israel
and Juda; Daniel was
cast
into the lions' den; and Shadrach,
Meshach
, and Abed-nego; and
Isaiah
and
Jeremiah; and Zachariah, and Zerobabel;
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and the
apostles
; Mary Magdalene, out of whom
were
cast
seven
devils; and the father of
Zebedee's children; and Pontius Pilate,
and the high
priest
, and Ananias and
Sapphira
,
and the
seven
trumpets, in the
Revelations
,
and the dragon, and the
woman
.
Amen. I add no more.
The lay people
present
were
most
pleased
with the
last
discourse
; and
some
of the
younger of the clergy: But the more aged,
gave the preference to the
first
. Thus it
seemed
difficult to decide.
The Captain
rising
up,
spoke
:
Gentlemen
,
said
he, the men
seem
both to have
considerable
gifts, and I
see
no harm in
letting them both preach. There is work
enough for them in this new country; the
first
appears to me, to be more qualified
for the city, as a very methodical
preacher
;
but the
last
is the
most
practical; and
each may
answer
a valuable
purpose
in
their proper place.
The
decision
seemed
judicious, and it
was agreed that they
should
both preach.
The man who had been the yarn merchant,
thanked their reverences, and gave out
that he would preach there that day week,
God willing.
The clergy were
so
pleased
with the
Captain
,
that they gave him an invitation to
go home with them to an elder's
house
,
just
by; but recollecting the trouble he
had with Teague on another
occasion
, and
the danger of being drawn into a like
predicament
,
should
he fall into
conversation
with the clergymen, and take it into his
head to preach, he declined the invitation,
and
hastened
to get his
horse
, and having
Teague along
side
, proceeded on his
journey
.
BOOK IV.
CHAP. I.
THE
insuing
day, the Captain arrived
in a certain city, and put up at the
sign
of the Indian Queen. Taking a day
or two to
refresh
himself
, and get a new
pair of breeches made, and his coat
mended
,
which was a little worn at the
elbows
,
he went to look about the city. The
fourth day, when he had
proposed
to
set
out to perambulate this modern Babylon,
and called for Teague to bring him his
boots, there was no Teague there. The
hostler
being called, with whom he
used
to
sleep
, informed, that he had
disappeared
the day before. The Captain was
alarmed
;
and, from the recollection of former
incidents, began to enquire if there were
any
elections going on at that time. As it
so
happened, there was one that very day.
Thinking it probable the bog-trotter,
having
still
a hankering after an appointment
might offer
himself
on that
occasion
, he
set
out to the place where the people were
convened, to
see
if he could
discover
Teague
amongst
the candidates. He could
see
nothing of him; and though he made
enquiry, he could hear no account. But
the
circumstance
of the election drawing
his attention for
some
time, he forgot
Teague.
The candidates were all remarkably
pot-bellied; and waddled in their gait.
The Captain enquiring what were the
pretensions
of
these
men to be elected; he was
told, that they had all
stock
in the funds,
and lived in large brick buildings; and
some
of them entertained fifty people at a
time, and eat and drank abundantly; and,
living an
easy
life, and pampering their
appetites
,
they had
swollen
to this
size
.
It is a
strange
thing,
said
the Captain, that
in the country, in my route, they would
elect
no one but a weaver, or a
whisky
distiller
;
and here none but fat
swabs
, that
guzzle
wine, and
smoke
segars
. It was not
so
in
Greece, where Phocion came with his plain
coat, from his humble dwelling, and
directed
the
counsels
of the people; or in Rome,
where Cincinnatus was made dictator from
the plough. Something
must
be wrong,
where the inflate, and pompous are the
objects
of choice. Though there is one good
arising
from it, that there is no danger of my
Teague here. He could not afford to give
a dinner; and as to funds, he has not a
single
shilling
in them. They will make him
neither mayor nor
legislator
in this city.
Na faith,
said
Mr. M`Donald, the Scotch
gentleman who had been
present
at the
embarrassment
of the Captain, on the
occasion
of the former election; and having, a few
days before, come to the city, and
observing
the Captain in the crowd, had come
up to
accost
him,
just
as he was uttering
these
last
words to
himself
: Na faith,
said
he, there is na danger of Teague here,
unless
he had his
scores
o'
shares
in the
bank; and was in league with the brokers,
and had a brick
house
at his hurdies, or
a
ship
or twa on the
stocks
. A great deal
used
to be done, by employing
advocates
with the
tradesmen
, to
listen
to the
news, and tell them fair
stories
; but all
is now
lost
in
substantial
interest
, and the
funds command every thing.
Besides
, this
city is
swarming
with Teagues, and
O'Regans
,
Vol. II. E
and O'Brians, and O'Murphys, and
O'Farrels; I
see
, that they cannot be at
a
loss
without your bog trotter.
The Captain having his fears
eased
, in
this particular, returned home, greatly
troubled,
nevertheless
, that he could not
come up with the
Irishman
.
CHAP. II.
REFLECTING with
himself
, that
Teague was inclined to women, and
that he might have gone to
some
of
those
houses
, which are not in the
best
repute
with the religious part of the community,
the Captain thought it might not be
amiss
to make enquiry. Being informed by the
waiter, that he had overheard gentlemen,
at the
house
, in their cups,
speak
of a
certain
Mrs.
Robeson
, who kept a
house
of
that kind; and, as far as he could
understand
,
it was in
such
a part of the city, a
few doors from
such
a
street
.
The Captain having
set
out, coming
into the neighbourhood, and making
inquiry
,
was directed to the
house
.
Knocking
,
and, on a
servant
coming to the door,
enquiring for Mrs.
Robeson
; he was
shewn
into a parlour, and in a little time the old
lady entered. Being
seated
, he took the
liberty of
addressing
her: Madam,
said
he,
I am not unacquainted with the
stile
and
designation
of your
house
. Why, as to that,
said
she
, we do the
best
we can; but the
times are hard, and it is a very difficult
thing to pick up a good looking healthy
girl, now a days. So many young
women
,
since
the war is over, having taken
to virtuous ways, and got married, has
almost
broke us up. But I have been
fortunate
enough to light upon one,
yesterday
,
that is a rare piece,
just
from the
country; and I am
sure
It is not in the way that you mean,
madam
,
said
the Captain, that I take the
liberty
to call upon you. I have a
servant
man, of the name of Teague O'Regan,
that is inclined to women, and has been
absent
some
days; and it has occurred to
me, that he may have come to your
house
,
or
some
other of the like kind; and may
be
skulking
, to avoid my
service
. As he
has little or no money, it is
impossible
he
can be much in your way; and I could
make it better worth your while to inform
on him, and
surrender
him up.
Teague O'Regan,
said
the old lady!
snuffing
; Teague O'Regan! I would have
you know,
sir
, that no Teague O'Regans
come here; we keep a
house
for the
first
gentlemen; not for waiters, or
understrappers
,
or any of the common
sorts
.
There is no half-crown, or five
shilling
pieces here. Teague O'Regan indeed!
there is no Teague O'Regan at this
house
.
We have meat for his
master
. I was
saying
there was a young woman
just
now
from the country, that looks more like a
woman of family, than a country girl;
but is
so
melancholy and
mopish
, that
she
scarcely
speaks
; and
stands
in need of
some
one to talk to her, and keep her in
spirits
. She is fit for any gentleman.
Teague O'Regan! Humph! There is no
Teague O'Regan puts his foot into my
door.
The Captain
assured
her, that he by no
means meant to give offence. That tho'
the bog-trotter could not have
access
to
her
first
rooms; yet he did not know but
he might have got in with
some
of her
under maids, and be about the kitchen.
The lady, being now
appeased
on the
score
of Teague, was in a good humour,
and renewed her hints to the Captain, with
respect
to the young woman. She is,
said
she
, as good looking a girl as ever came
to my
house
; and has not
seen
a
single
person
but
yourself
, whom
she
has not yet
seen
; but may
see
, if you
chuse
; and
E 2
a very pretty girl
she
is; but keeps
mopish
and melancholy, as if
she
was
crossed
in love, and had come to town for
fear of her relations, and
wishes
to keep
out of
sight
of every body.
The Captain being no
stranger
to the art
these
matrons
use
, in their
addresses
, to
enhance the value of their wares, was but
little moved with the recommendation
she
had given. But as there were
some
circumstances
in the account of the young
woman, that were a little
striking
, his
curiosity
was excited to let her be called in,
and
present
herself
. Accordingly, the old
lady
stepping
out, a young woman made
her appearance, of
considerable
beauty;
but in her countenance
expressions
of woe.
Her blue eye
seemed
involved in
mist
;
for
she
shed
no tears; her
sorrow
was
beyond that.
Young woman,
said
the Captain, it is
easy
to perceive that you have not been
in this way of life long; and that you have
been brought to it, perhaps, by
some
uncommon
circumstances
. My humanity is
interested
; and it occurs to me to
ask
, by
what means it has come to
pass
. The part
which he
seemed
to take in her
distress
,
inspiring
her with confidence; and being
requested
by him to relate her
story
frankly
,
she
began as follows:
My father,
said
she
, lives at the
distance
of about twenty miles from this city, and
is a man of good
estate
. I have two
brothers
,
but no
sisters
. My mother dying
when I was at the age of fourteen, I
became
house
-keeper for the family.
There was a young man that
used
to
come to the
same
church to which we went.
He was of the very
lowest
class
, mean in
his appearance, of homely features, and
a dimunitive
person
. Yet he had the
assurance
to put
himself
in my way on every
occasion
; endeavouring to catch my eye;
for he did not dare to
speak
to me. But
I hated him, and was
almost
resolved
to
stay
at home on Sundays, to avoid him;
for he began to be very
troublesome
. His
attentions to me were taken notice of by
my brothers. They were confident that I
must
give him
some
encouragement, or he
would not make
such
advances. My
father
was of the
same
opinion. I
assured
them I had never given him any
encouragement
,
and I never would; that I was
as much
averse
to him as
possible
.
I
shunned
him and hated him. He
persisted
a long time,
almost
two years, and
seemed
to become melancholy, and at
last
went away from the neighbourhood; and,
as I heard afterwards, to
sea
. I began
now to reflect upon his
assiduity
, and
endeavours
to engage my affections. I
recollected
every
circumstance
of his conduct
towards me,
since
the
first
time I was
obliged
to take notice of him. I
reasoned
with
myself
, that it was no fault of his, if
his family was low; and if he
himself
had
not all that
comeliness
of
person
which I
wished
in a
husband
; yet he was
sufficiently
punished
in his
presumption
in
thinking
of me, by what he
must
have
suffered
,
and by his going to
sea
, which he did to
get out of my
sight
, finding his attempts
to gain my affections,
hopeless
. I
dreamed
of him; and
scarcely
a moment of the
day
passed
, but my thoughts were running
on the danger to which he was
exposed
.
It
seemed
to me that if he came back, I
should
be more kind to him. I might at
least
shew
him, that I was not
insensible
of his attachment.
In about a year he returned, and the
moment I
saw
him, I loved him. He did
not dare to come to my father's
house
. But
I could not help giving him
encouragement
,
by my countenance, when I met
him in public. Emboldened by this, he
at
last
ventured to
speak
to me; and I
agreed
that he might come to a peach
orchard
,
at
some
distance
from my father's
house
, and that I would give him an
interview
.
There he came often; and with
a
most
lowly, and humble behaviour,
fixed
my regard for him. Not doubting the
violence of his love for me, and my
ascendency
over him, I at
last
put
myself
in his power. Becoming pregnant, I
hinted
marriage; but what was my
astonishment
to find, that, on various pretences,
he evaded it; and as I became more fond,
he became more cold; which had no other
effect, than to make me more ardent than
before. It had been
usual
, for many
months, to meet me every evening at this
place; but now I had gone often, and did
not find him there. At
last
he withdrew
altogether, and I heard he had left the
settlement
.
Worthless
and
base
, as I now
knew him to be; and, though my
reason
told me, that in
person
he was
still
as
homely as I
first
thought him, yet I
continued
to love him to
distraction
.
What was my
distress
, when my father,
and my brothers, found that I was with
child? They charged me, though
unjustly
,
of having deceived them with
respect
to my attachment to this low creature,
from the
first
: In fine, my father
dismissed
me from the
house
: My brothers, no
less
relenting than him, in their
resentment
against
me, upbraided me with the offers
I had
refused
, and the treatment I had
given
several
gentlemen, in their advances to
me. For, indeed, during the
absence
of
this
worthless
man, I had been
addressed
by
several
; but my pity and
compassion
for the wretch, had
so
wrought upon
me, that I could not think of any, or
scarcely
bear them to
speak
to me.
Dismissed
from my father's
house
, even
my younger brother, who was
most
soft
and
yielding in his nature,
seeming
to approve
of it, I went to the habitation of a tenant
of my father; there remained
some
time,
and endeavoured to make
compensation
,
by the labour of my hands, for the
trouble
I was giving them. But
these
poor
people, thinking my father would relent,
had informed him where I was, and of
the care they had taken of me. The
consequence
was, that, at the end of three
months, he
sent
for the child, of which I
had been brought to bed
some
weeks
before
;
but ordered them
instantly
to
dismiss
me, that I might never more offend
his hearing with my name.
I wandered to this city, and the
first
night lay in the market
house
, upon a
bench. The next morning mixed with
the women that came to market, and
enquired
for work of any kind. I could find
none; but at
last
meeting with a young
woman who felt for my
distress
,
she
told
me, that
she
had a
small
room in this
city
,
where
she
had lived
some
time with an
aunt that was lately dead; and that now
she
supported
herself
by doing a little in
the millinery way; that if I would come
and take
breakfast
with her, and
see
where
she
lived, I was welcome. Going with
the poor girl, I found her lonely and
distressed
enough.
Nevertheless
I continued
with her
several
months. But the work
was
small
that we got to do, and times
becoming
still
worse
, I was obliged to
sell
the cloths that I brought with me, to
the
last
petticoat and
short
gown, to
support
ourselves
and pay rent. To bring
me to the
last
stage
of
misery
, the poor
girl who was more expert than I was, in
making any little
provision
that could be
made, fell
sick
and in
short
time died. I
could bear to
stay
no longer in the room,
and coming out to wander in the
streets
,
like a forlorn wretch indeed, and
sobbing
sorely
by
myself
, when I thought no one
heard me, I was
observed
by this woman,
at
whose
house
you now are, and
pressed
by her to go home. I
soon
found what
sort
of a
house
it was, and had I not been
watched, when I talked of going away,
and threatened to be
sent
to jail, for what,
it is pretended I owe
since
I came to the
house
, I
should
not have been here
longer
than the
first
day.
The Captain feeling with great
sensibility
the
circumstances
of her
story
, made
reply: Said he, Young woman, I greatly
commiserate
your
history
and
situation
,
and feel
myself
impelled to revenge your
wrong. But the villain which has thus
injured
you, is out of my reach, in two
respects
;
first
, by
distance
; and
second
,
being
too contemptible and
base
to be
pursued
by my
resentment
even on your account.
But revenge is not your object, but
support
and
restoration
to your friends, and
the good opinion of the world. As to
money, it is not in my power to advance
you any great
sum
; but as far as words
can go, I could
wish
to
serve
you: not
words to
yourself
only; but to others, in
your behalf. It is evident to me, that
you have
suffered
by your own too great
sensibility
. It was humanity and
generosity
,
that engaged you in his favour.
It was your imagination, that gave
those
attractions to his vile and uncomely
person
,
by which you was
seduced
. You have
been a victim to your own
goodness
, and
not to his merit. The warmth of your
heart has overcome the
strength
of your
judgment; and your prudence has been
subdued
by your
passion
: or, rather,
indeed
,
confiding in a man whom you had
saved
from all the pains, and heart-felt
miseries
of
unsuccessful
love, you have
become
a
sacrifice
to your
compassion
and
tenderness
. The
best
advice I can give
you, is, to
compose
yourself
for this night.
Preserve
your virtue; for I do not
consider
you as having
lost
it: your mind has
not been in fault, or contaminated. I
will endeavour to find out
some
person
,
who may be
disposed
to
assist
you; and,
though it may be difficult for you yet to
establish
lost
fame, it is not
impossible
. So
saying
, he left the room; but the young
woman,
impressed
with
these
last
words
especially
, viz. the diffculty, if not
impossibility
,
of regaining reputation,
sunk
Vol. II. F
down upon her chair, and could not pay
him the compliment of thanks, at his
departure
.
During the night, through the whole
of which he lay awake, at the public
house
,
he ruminated on the extraordinary nature
of this incident, and the means which he
would adopt to recover this woman from
her unfortunate
situation
.
Thought he, I am in a city where there
are a great body of the people called
Quakers
.
This
society
, above all others, is
remarkable
for humanity, and charitable actions.
There is a female preacher, of whom I
have heard; a Lydia
Wilson
: I will
inform
this good woman of the
circumstance
;
and, if ge gives me leave, I will bring
this
stray
sheep
to her;
she
may have it
in her power to introduce her to
some
place, where, by needle work, and
industry
,
she
might live, until it may be in
my power, taking a journey to her father,
and
stating
the
case
, and giving my
sentiments
,
to
restore
her to her family.
Early next morning, as
soon
as it could
be
presumed
, the Quaker lady had
set
her
house
in order;
that is, after the
family
might be
supposed
to have
breakfasted
,
which was about nine o'clock, the
Captain
set
out; and being admitted,
stated
to Mrs.
Wilson
, the exact
circumstances
as before related. The pious woman
readily
undertook every office in her
power
.
Accordingly, taking leave, the
Captain
set
out for the
house
of Mrs.
Robeson
.
At the door, he met a number of men
coming out, and, on inquiry, he found a
coroner's
inquest
had
just
sat
on the body of a
young woman of the
house
, who had the
preceding evening,
suspended
herself
from
the bed
post
with her garter. He was
struck
,
suspecting
it
must
be the young
woman whom he had
so
much in his
thoughts. Going in, and enquiring, he
found it to be the
case
; and that they
proposed
to bury as
soon
as the few boards of
a coffin could be got ready. As a man of
humanity, he could not but
shed
tears;
and blame
himself
that he had not given
her
stronger
assurance
of his
interposition
before he left her, that
she
might not have
fallen into
despair
, and taken away her
life.
The coffin being now ready, the
funeral
set
out, not for the burying ground of
a church yard; but for a place without
the city, called the Potter's-field: For
suicide
forfeits
Christian
burial: Her
obsequies
attended, not by a clergyman in
front, nor by
scarfed
mourners, holding
up the pall; nor was
she
borne on a bier,
but drawn on a cart; and the company
that followed her uncovered
herse
, were
not decent matrons, nor venerable men,
but old bauds, and
strumpets
, and cullies,
half drunk, making merry as they went
along
.
Being interred, they returned home; but
the Captain remaining
some
time,
contemplating
the grave, thus
spoke
:
Earth, thou
coverest
the body of a
lovely
woman, and with a mind not
less
lovely
;
yet doomed in her burial, to the
same
ground with negroes, and malefactors;
not that I think the
circumstance
makes
any
difference; but it
shews
the opinion
of the world with
respect
to thy
personal
demerit. Nor do I call in
question
the
justness
of this opinion; having
such
circumstances
whereon to found it. But I
reflect with
myself
how much opinion,
operating
like a general law, may do
injustice
.
It remains only with heaven's chancery to
reach the equity of the
case
, and
absolve
her from a crime; or at
least
qualify that
which was the
excess
of virtue. If the fair
elements that
composed
her frame,
shall
ever again unite, and
rise
to life, and as
the divines
suppose
, her form receive its
shape
, and complexion from her mental
qualities, and conduct on earth,
she
will
lose
nothing of her beauty; for her daring
disdain
of
herself
and fate, was a mark of
repentance,
stronger
than all tears. Yet,
had
she
acted the nobler part of holding
herself
in life,
preserving
her mind and
body
chaste
until famine had taken her
away
,
or the hand of heaven moved for
her relief,
she
had
shone
, at the
last
rising
,
with
superior
brightness
; been ranked
amongst
the
first
beauties of heaven, and
walked
distinguished
in the
paradise
of
God.
Doubtless
the Almighty
must
blame,
and chide her for this premature and
rash
step
. Fallen to the
last
point of
depression
,
he was about to relieve her, and the
sequel
of her days might have been happy
and
serene
. It was a
distrust
of his
providence
.
She heard my words, though
she
did not know my heart. And
surely
it was my intention to relieve her. But
she
erred
against
my thoughts;
she
eluded
the
grasp
of my humanity. For this
she
will be reprimanded by the
Most
High;
and fail of that
supereminent
glory which
awaits heroic minds. Yet, O world, thou
F 2
dost
her wrong, in
sentencing
her to
so
low
a bed. Shall the wealthy, but
dishonest
men; matrons
chaste
, but cold and
cruel
in their feelings;
shall
these
have a
stone
built over them, and occupy a
consecrated
spot
;
whilst
thou, unworthy, art
thrown
amongst
the
rubbish
of
carcases
,
swept
from jails; or of emigrants,
unknown
as to their origin and place.
Farewel, lovely form, whom late I
knew; and let the
grass
grow green upon
thy grave. Thy
sorrows
are expunged;
but mine are awake; and will be
so
,
until
I
also
come to the
shades
invisible
, and
have the
same
apathy of heart with thee.
BOOK V.
CHAP. I.
RETURNING to his lodging, he
could not help reflecting by the way,
that probably poor Teague, mortified by
repeated
disappointments
, in going to
Congress
, being
suffered
to preach, or be
a member of the
Philosophical
Society;
and what might afflict him
still
more, the
not marrying the rich
hostess
, who had
made him overtures, might, in his
despair
of ever coming forward in any
respectable
capacity in life, have
suspended
himself
from a beam, or plunged into the river,
and have put an end to his
existence
;
which,
should
it be the
case
, being in
some
measure
accessary
to this
catastrophe
of the bog-trotter, by
dissuading
from
these
several
pretensions
, he could not acquit
himself
of guilt; at all events, he would
feel great pain and
sorrow
.
Such were his reflections for a great
part of this day; and had thought of
putting
an
advertisement
in the paper, to
know if any dead body had been lately
discovered
; or
inquisition
held on a young
man, with red hair, and a long leg, who
had been
missing
some
days, and was
supposed
to have hung or drowned
himself
.
But in the evening, meditating thus,
mention
being made by
some
of the lodgers,
of going to hear the annual oration,
delivered
before the
Philosophical
Society,
by a member; it
struck
his mind, that
possibly
Teague, falling in with
some
of
this body, had been induced by them to
take a
seat
, and might be
present
on that
occasion
. Not
hesitating
, therefore, he
seconded
the
proposal
of going; and
offered
to be of the party.
Coming to the hall, the
philosophers
were
seated
; but a black member
sat
with
a taper before him, who, it
seems
, was
to deliver the oration.
The fact was this; A gentleman of
Maryland
of the name of Gorum, had
sent
to the
society
,
some
time before, a
curiosity
found by one of his negroes in the
mud of Wye river, on the banks of which
his
seat
was. It appeared to be a
stone
,
with a cavity
sufficient
to receive a man's
foot, and was adjudged by the
society
to
be an Indian's petrified
moccason
. The
singularity
of the
discovery
, well intitling
the gentleman to a
seat
, he was invited;
but
sending
his compliments, he gave
them to
understand
, that Cuff, (for that
was the name of the negro) was more
intitled
to that honour than he was, being
the
person
who had found the
curiosity
;
and as he made it a point to do his
slaves
justice
in any
perquisite
of their own, he
could not think of robbing one, on this
occasion
of any honour, to which he might
be introduced by this
discovery
.
The
society
approved his
honesty
, and
fair dealing; and by unanimous ballot,
admitted the negro; who, having been a
member
some
time, had been appointed,
to pronounce the annual oration. Cuff, a
good deal
disconcerted
in hearing of the
task
imposed
upon him, had applied to
his
master
to know what to
say
. Colonel
Gorum attending a good deal to literary
matters, had heard of an oration delivered
before the
society
, the object of which was
to prove that the Africans had been once
white, had
sharp
noses
, and long hair;
but that by living in
sun
-burnt climates,
the
skin
had changed colour, the hair
become
frizzled, and in the
course
of
generation
,
the imagination of the mother,
presenting
obtuse
objects, had produced an
offspring
with flat
noses
. He therefore gave
Cuff to
understand
, that it would be doing
no more than
justice
to his countrymen, for
he was a Guinea negro, if he
should
avail
himself
of this
occasion
to prove that men
were all once black, and that by living in
snowy
countries, and being bleached by
the weather, the
skin
had gradually become
white, and the hair
moist
and long, and
the imagination
presenting
prominent
objects
to the mothers, or the fathers
differing
among
themselves
, and pulling one
another
by this part, had given the long and
pointed
nose
.
Cuff, thus prepared,
set
out; having
arrived
,
and being on this
occasion
to
harangue
,
began as follows:
The
Oration.
Massa

The oration being ended, the Society
could do no
less
than appoint a committee
to wait on Mr. Cuff, and
request
a copy
of his oration, that it might be
published
.
But the Captain, in the mean time, had
examined, with great attention, the whole
audience; but could not
discover
Teague.
Departing, therefore, with the
rest
, his
thoughts recurred to his
first
idea, viz.
that the unfortunate creature had
committed
suicide
. Drawing up, therefore, an
advertisement
, he
sent
it to a daily paper;
but, though it appeared next morning,
and the day
elapsed
, there was no word of
Teague.
CHAP. II.
THERE is no fact that has proved
more
stubborn
than the
diversity
of
the human
species
;
especially
that great
extreme of
diversity
in the natives of
Africa
.
How the
descendants
of Adam and
Eve, both good looking people,
should
ever come to be a vile negro, or even a
mulatto man or woman, is puzzling.
Some have conjectured, that a black
complexion, frizzled hair, a flat
nose
, and
bandy legs, were the mark
set
on Cain,
for the murder of his brother Abel. But,
as the deluge drowned the whole world,
and only one family was
saved
, the blacks
must
have all
perished
; like the
Mammoth
,
whose
bones are found on the
Ohio, and other places, which was too big
for Noah to get into the ark.
Some
suppose
, that it was the
curse
pronounced
upon Canaan, the
son
of Noah,
for looking at his father's
nakedness
. They
got rid by this means of the difficulty of
Vol. II. G
the flood; but by
Moses
' own account,
the Canaanites were the
descendents
of
Canaan; and we do not hear of them
being
negroes; which, had it been the
case
,
we cannot doubt would have been laid hold
of by the
Israelites
, as a
circumstance
to
justify
their extirpating, or making
slaves
of them.
Lord Kames, in his Sketches of the
History
of Man,
solves
the difficulty, by
supposing
,
that, at the building of Babel,
there was a
confusion
of complexions, as
well as languages. But,
besides
that it is
not to be
supposed
, that the
historian
would
pass
over
so
material a
circumstance
,
without
particularly mentioning it, it is
introducing
a miracle, which we are not
warranted
in doing,
unless
it had been
expressly
laid down to have been wrought.
The
last
theory, has been that of
accounting
for the change, from the
climate
,
and accident of wind and weather;
calling in aid, in the mean time, the
imagination
of the mothers. This does not
appear
altogether
satisfactory
. At
least
, there
are
those
who would not be
averse
to hear
some
other
solution
of the difficulty. I
have thought of one, which I would
suggest
with great diffidence; the authors of
those
before me being great men, and their
hypothesis
not lightly overthrown.
I am of opinion that Adam was a tall,
straight
limbed, red haired man, with a fair
complexion, blue eyes, and an aquiline
nose
; and that Eve was a negro woman.
For what
necessity
to make them both
of the
same
colour, feature, and form,
when there is beauty in variety. Do not
you
see
in a tulip, one leaf blue, and
another
white, and
sometimes
the
same
leaf
white and red?
As God made Adam in his own
likeness
,
so
it is to be
supposed
, that Adam
begat
some
in his; and
these
were red
haired, fair complexioned, blue eyed,
proportionably
featured boys and girls; while,
on the other hand,
some
took after the
mother, and became negro men and
women
.
From a mixture of complexion, the
offspring, at other times, might be a
shade
darker, in one
case
, than the father; and
a
shade
lighter, in another
case
, than the
mother; and hence, a
diversifyed
progeny
,
with a variety of features; from the
bottle-
nose
to the mire-
snipe
; which is that
of the people in the
west
of Ireland; and
from the auburn of the
Corsican
hair, to
the golden locks of the Caledonian
beauty
;
and from the black eye, to the hazle
and the grey.
It may be
asked
, How at the flood?
when Noah, his wife, his three
sons
, and
their wives, eight
persons
, only were
saved
?
It is but giving
some
of the
sons
negro
wenches for their wives, and you have the
matter all right.
CHAP. III.
AS I have
said
, the day
passed
over, and
there was no word of Teague. In
the evening, as it was
usual
with the
gentlemen
at the Indian Queen, to go to
some
place for the
amusement
of an hour or
two; mention being made of a celebrated
preacher, a
Universalist
, as he was called;
that is, one who preaches the doctrine of
universal
salvation
; it was
proposed
to go
to hear him, as he was to hold forth that
evening. The Captain readily
consented
;
and it
struck
him, that, as this was a new
fangled doctrine, and the preacher had
made a great
noise
; and as it was a
doctrine that,
conscious
of a good deal of
fornication, would naturally
please
Teague,
it was not
impossible
but the
Irishman
might have become a
disciple
of this
reformist
,
and be at his conventicle.
Coming in
amongst
the crowd, and
obtaining
seats
, they
saw
the preacher
ascend
the pulpit, and, after the preliminary
exercise
G 2
of
psalms
and prayer, take a text,
and begin his
sermon
.
His text was taken from one of
those
passages
of
scripture
, which
speaks
of the
lion lying down with the kid, and the
tyger
with the lamb; which have been
interpreted
of the Millenium; but were
applied
by him, to that period, when, as
the
sea
shall
give up her dead,
so
hell
shall
give up her damned; and the devil
himself
shall
come to lick
salt
out of the hand
of an angel.
Enlarging on this doctrine, and
supporting
it with a variety of proofs from
scripture
, and arguments from
reason
, he
seemed
to have brought the matter to a
point;
answering
all objections, and
closing
in with the hearer. At this
stage
,
using
that figure of oratory, which is
usual
in
the pulpit, of
asking
questions
, and
pressing
for an
answer
, but expecting none;
he would
say
, Is not this
conclusive
? Is it
not evident? Is there any here can advance
an argument
against
it? Will any of you
speak
I
pause
for an
answer
?
Mr. M`Donald, in the mean time, (the
Scotch gentleman; who happened to be
there,) thinking him really
serious
, and
that he wanted an
answer
; or taking
advantage
of the
pause
, and the
interrogation
,
to
speak
his mind, leaning over the
front of a back
seat
, made reply:
Why,
said
he, I like the doctrine well
enough, and ha' na'
disposition
to
o'erthrow
it. I dinna muckle care if there
ware na' hell ava. If ye could make that
out, I wad rather hear it, than o' being
smoaked
twa' or three
thousand
years in
the devil's nuke, or
singed
wi' his burnt
brimstone
, even if we
should
get out
afterwards
.
Ye need na' put
yoursel
in a
passion
, or be flee'd that you'll no get
proselytes
;
for I
shall
warrant you, as many
every night as ye can weel
stow
awa i' the
conventicle.
The preacher giving thanks to God for
the
success
in his
ministry
, in the
remarkable
conversion
of the man who
spoke
, the
Scotch gentleman
said
again; Ye need
na ca' it a
conversion
; for I ha' been o'
the
same
opinion a' my life; that it was a
sare
thing to bide the kiln of hell, and
they wad
deserve
muckle thanks wha could
establish
that we
should
na'
stay
long in it,
or that there was na'
such
place ava.
The preacher commenting upon this,
observed
that
some
were orthodox from
their birth, like Jeremiah, who was
sanctified
in his mother's womb; but others
were hardly brought to the truth, with
much teaching and
instruction
. That the
present
was a happy
instance
of one who
was in the right way from his very early
years.
The Captain in the mean time, had been
thinking of the doctrine; and thought it
reasonable
to
suppose
, that the Almighty
might relieve after
some
time, and let the
damned devils go.
Just
as with
himself
at
present
in the
case
of Teague; if he had
got his hands on the bog-trotter, he could
not help being very angry, and would be
disposed
to
punish
him with great
severity
;
but after
some
time he knew his
passion
would
subside
, and he would forget his
delinquencies.
Teague in this manner running in his
head, as the people, after
some
epilogue of
prayer and benediction, being
dismissed
,
were retiring, he got up, and
raising
his
voice, begged the audience to detain a
little.  Good people,
said
he, if any of
you
should
come
across
a young man, a
servant
of mine, of the name of Teague
O'Regan, I
shall
thank you to
send
me
notice
to the Indian Queen, where I lodge.
And, according to the
advertisement
in
this day's paper, I will give two dollars
reward.
Thinking him deranged in his brain,
they proceeded, and took no notice of the
proclamation.
CHAP. IV.
Containing
Observations
.
IN the infancy of
Christianity
it was
thought a hard matter to get to
heaven
;
and that when once in hell, there
was no geting out. A certain father of
the church, of the name of Origen, was
the
first
to be more liberal in his
sentiments
,
and thought, that after a certain
period, there would be a jail-delivery of
the damned. I do not know that he went
so
far as to let the devils
themselves
out
upon a furlough; but at the
present
time,
we all know very well, that the time will
come, when they will be out all together;
at
least
the
universalists
tell us this, and
prove it.
The doctrine was received in
some
part
by the early councils; but in other parts
rejected. The matter was compounded
by
establishing
a purgatory; for not
consenting
to liberate from hell, in order to
satisfy
the advocates of a temporary
punishment
,
they fixed up a middle place,
where all the advantages of penal
purgation
could be enjoyed, without the
necessity
of contradicting the eternity of hell
torments.
Indeed under the catholic church, the
strait
gate,
and
the narrow way,
and the
many called, and few
chosen
,
was a good deal
laid
aside
, and the road made pretty plain
by indulgencies and
absolutions
. But at
the reformation, the matter was brought
back to its old bed again, and the cry of
their being but a
remnant
saved
, was
raised
in every pulpit. There has been
some
relaxation of late years with
almost
every
sect
of
Protestants
; and there is not
just
such
a fury of tumbling great crowds into
the tolbooth, as there was in the days of
John Knox, and the framers of the
Westminster
confession
of faith, and
catechisms
.
Dr. Bellamy, a New-England divine,
some
years ago,
stated
in his pamphlet, that the
damned would be to the
saved
, as the
malefactors
of a country to
honest
people that
came to an untimely end by jail or gibbet.
Some now preach boldly, not perhaps a
total exemption, from future
punishment
,
but a final
restoration
from it;
so
that the
matter is now brought nearly to what it
was in the days of Origen. I do not know
that I would be of opinion with the
Scotch gentleman, and
wish
the matter
carried farther,
establishing
that there is
no hell at all;
because
if the thing
should
take a turn, it might go to the other
extreme
,
and be all hell;
so
that none
should
be
saved
; and
instead
of
universal
salvation
,
we
should
then have the doctrine of
the damnation of the whole, bodily.
CHAP. V.
THE next day, revolving every thing
in his mind, it occurred to the
Captain
,
that the
Irishman
might have gone
out of town, hearing of an election at a
district
, and have been elected to
Congress
.
As that body was then
sitting
, he thought
it could be no great trouble to go to the
house
, and
cast
an eye from the gallery,
and
see
if the raggamuffin had got there.
There was one that had a little of the
brogue of Teague upon his tongue, but
nothing of his
physiognomy
; others had a
good deal of his manner; but there was
none that came
absolutely
up to the
physic
of his
person
.
However, being here, the Captain tho't
it not
amiss
to
listen
a while to the
debates
upon the carpet. A certain bill was
depending, and made, it
seems
, the order
of the day. Mr. Cogan being on the floor,
spoke
:Sir,
said
he,
addressing
himself
to
the chair, the bill in contemplation, is, in
Vol. II. H
my opinion, of a dangerous tendency. I
will venture to foretel, that, if it goes into
a law, the cows will have fewer calves,
and the
sheep
less
wool; hens will lay
fewer eggs, and cocks forget to crow
day-light
.
The
horses
will be
worse
shod
, and
stumble
more; our watches go too
slow
;
corns grow upon our toes; young women
have the
stomach
ach; old men the gout;
and middle aged
persons
fainting fits. The
larks will fall dead in the field; the frogs
croak till they
burst
their bags; and the
leaves of the trees fall before the autumn.
Snow will be found in the heat of
harvest
,
and dog days in winter. The rivers will
revert; and the
shadows
fall to the
east
in
the morning. The moon will be
eclipsed
;
and the equinoxes happen at a wrong
season
of the year. Was it not
such
a bill
as this, that changed the old
stile
; that
made the
eclipse
in the time of Julius
Cesar
;
that produced an earthquake at
Jamaica
,
and
sunk
Port Royal? All
history
,
both ancient and modern, is full of
the
mischiefs
of
such
a bill. I
shall
,
therefore
,
vote
against
it.
Mr. Bogan was now on the floor, and
advocated the good effects of the bill.
Sir,
said
he,
addressing
himself
to the
chair, I appear in
support
of the bill. I
say
, it will have a good effect on the
physical
world
especially
. The ducks will be
fatter, the
geese
heavier, the
swans
whiter,
the red-birds
sing
better, and partridges
come more
easily
into traps. It will kill
rats, muzzle calves, and cut colts; and
multiply the breed of
oysters
, and pickle
cod-
fish
. It will moderate the
sun
's heat, and
the winter's cold; prevent fogs, and cure
the ague. It will help the natural brain;
brace the nerves, cure
sore
eyes, and the
cholic, and remove
rheumatisms
.
Consult
experience, and it will be found, that
provisions
of the nature
proposed
by this
bill, have an
astonishing
influence in this
respect
, where they have been tried. I
must
take the liberty to
say
, the gentleman's
allegations are totally
unfounded;
and he
has
committed
himself
, in the matter of his
history
; the earthquake in Jamaica, not
happening in the time of Julius
Cesar
; and
therefore could have nothing to do with
the
eclipse
of the
sun
. I
shall
, therefore,
vote in favour of the bill.
Mr. Cogan
rose
to explain; and
said
,
that he did not
say
, that the earthquake at
Jamaica, was at the
same
time with the
clipse
of the
sun
, which happened at the
birth of Julius
Cesar
.
Mr. Bogan
rose
to correct the
gentleman
:
It was not at the birth of Julius
Cesar
, but at his death, that the
earthquake
happened.
Mr. Hogan was on the floor: Said, he
thought he could reconcile the gentlemen
on that head. It was well known Julius
Cesar
lived about the time of the rebellion
in Scotland; a little after Nebuchadnezzar,
king of the Jews. As to the earthquake,
he did not remember what year it
happened
;
and therefore could
say
nothing about
it.
At this period, the
question
being
called
,
it was put, and carried by a majority
of 25.
The Captain,
satisfied
with this
sample
of
Congressional
debates, retired, and came
to his lodging.
CHAP. VI.
IT was about three or four o'clock in
the afternoon, that
some
one, who had
read the
advertisement
respecting
Teague,
came to the Captain, and informed him,
that a
person
,
answering
the
description
,
had been lately employed to teach Greek
in the
University
. Struck with the idea,
that the bog-trotter might have
passed
himself
for a Greek
scholar
, whereas he
understood
only
Irish
, he
set
out to the
University
,
to make enquiry. Knocking at
the door of the principal, he was
admitted
;
and, being
seated
,
addressed
him as
follows: Said he,
sir
, a
pedeseque
of mine,
(for talking to the rector of a college, he
did not
chuse
to
use
the vulgar terms,
waiter
,
or bog-trotter,) a
pedeseque
of mine,
whom I have found
useful
,
save
that he is
somewhat
troublesome
in pretending to
places of appointment for which he is not
H 2
qualified; a thing, by the bye, too
common
in this country; where men,
without
the aid of academic knowledge,
thrust
themselves
into places requiring great
learning and ability: (This he
said
to
slatter
the man of letters; as if a man could
know but little, that had not been forged
or
furbished
at his
school
): I
say
, this
pedeseque
of mine, has
absconded
for
some
days; and I have been able to collect no
account of him until
last
evening, that a
person
, having read an
advertisement
of
mine in the gazette, came to me, and
informed
,
that one,
answering
the
description
I had given, both as to appearance
and
accomplishments
, had been lately
employed
,
as
professor
of the Greek language,
in this
University
. Now, though I well
know this Pady, as I may call him, to
understand
no Greek; yet, as he
speaks
Irish
,
and has much
assurance
, and little
honesty
in matters where his ambition is
concerned, I did not know, but he might
have
imposed
himself
upon you, for a
Greek
scholar
, and obtained a
professorship
.
The principal made
answer
, that it was
true that a
person
from Ireland had been
lately employed in that capacity; and that
should
he be
discovered
to be an
inpostor
,
it would be
using
the
university
very ill.
The Captain thought
so
too; and taking
it for granted that it was Teague,
expressed
his
surprise
that they had not
examined
him, before he was admitted; or at
least
had
such
proof by letters as would
have had
ascertained
his being qualified.
The principal
observed
, that as to
examination
they had no one at hand to
examine
,
as there were none of the
trustees
or
professors
of other branches in the
university
understood
Greek; as for
himself
he did not, having not
studied
it in early
life, and for a
series
of years, having
giving
himself
to politics and mathematics;
so
that
unless
they could
send
out for a
Roman Catholic
priest
, or a Scotch
clergyman
,
there was none to examine. The
improbability of any
person
passing
himself
,
above all things, for a
master
of the
Greek language on the
score
of
understanding
Irish
, was
such
, that it never came
into
their heads to
suspect
it,
so
as to demand
letters.
Had you known
said
the Captain, this
bog-trotter of mine, (here he forgot the
word
pedeseque
) as well as I do, you
would not be
surprised
at his attempting
any thing; and that he
should
be now in
your academy giving Greek lectures,
understanding
nothing but the vernacular
tongue of his own country. Here he gave
an account of his
setting
up for
Congress
,
&c. as explained in the preceding
part of this narrative.
However,
wishing
to
see
the
raggamuffin
that he might unkennel him, he was
accompanied by the principal to the
chamber
of the
pseudo
professor
,
considering
as
he went along, in what manner he
should
accost
him; whether he
should
break out
upon him with a direct invective, or with
ironical words;
such
as, Mr.
Professor
,
you
must
be a very learned man, not only
to
understand
Irish
, but Greek: but
perhaps
the Greek and
Irish
language are
much the
same
. It
must
be
so
; for I know
that a few days ago, you did not
understand
a word of this, and to acquire a dead
language in
such
a
short
time would be
impossible
,
unless
the living tongue was a
good deal a-kin to it. But I had never
understood
that
Irish
had any more affinity
to the language of Athens and Sparta,
than the
Erse
, or the German, or the
Welch; however, we
must
live and learn,
as the
saying
is; you have
shewn
us what
we never knew before.
Conning a
speech
of this
sort
in his own
mind, with a view to divert the principal,
and
amuse
himself
with Teague, he
entered
the chamber of the
professor
; who
sat
in an elbow chair with Thucidydes before
him.
What was the
surprise
of the Captain
to find that it was not Teague.
In fact, it was a
person
not wholly
unlike
him,
especially
in a hinge of the
brogue which he betrayed in his
discourse
;
for though the
professor
was really a man
of education, having been early
sent
to St.
Omer's, where he had
studied
, being
intended
for a
priest
, and
understood
not
only the Greek, and Latin, but
spoke
French; yet in the pronunciation of the
English
tongue, he had that prolongation
of the
sound
of a word, and articulation
of the vowel O, which
constitutes
what
is vulgarly called the brogue, as being
the pronunciation of the native
Irish
; who
being a
depressed
people, are
most
of them
poor, and wear a kind of mean
shoe
, which
they call a brogue.
After an apology to the
professor
for
mistaking
him for a certain Teague
O'Regan
,
whom he had in his employment,
at the
request
of the
professor
, the
principal
and the Captain took
seats
.
The
professor
said
, His name was not
O'Regan, being O'Dougherty; but he
knew the O'Regans very well in Ireland.
There was a Pady O'Regan in the
same
class
with him at St. Omer's, when he read
Craike. That he was a good
scholar
, and
understood
Craike very well; and he would
be glad if he was over in this country to
tach Craike here; it appeared to be a very
scarce
language; but he had become a
praste
, and was now a
missionary
to
Paraguay
,
in Sout-America.
The Captain punning on his
pronunciation
of the word Greek; and willing to
amuse
himself
a little with the
professor
,
could not help
observing
, that he was
under
a
mistake
, as to the
scarceness
of the
Craike language in
these
States. That
there were whole tribes who
spoke
the
Craike language; there was that of the
heron, and the raven, and
several
other
fowls. A German
professor
, who was
present
,
apprehending the Captain to be
under
a
mistake
, and willing to correct him,
observed
It is,
said
he, the Creek
language
,
that the
professor
means. As to
that,
said
the Captain, it is
also
spoken
plentifully in America. There is a whole
nation of Indians, on the borders of South
Carolina and Georgia, that
speak
the Creek
language; men, women, and children.
The
professor
knowing more of the
classics
than of the geography of
these
United
States, and of the heathen gods more
than of the aborigines of this country,
expressed
astonishment
. If what you tell me
be a trut,
said
he, it is a crate
discovery
:
perhaps
dese
may have de fragments o' de
books o' de
philosophers
and poets that
are
lost
, and de
professors
cannot come
acrass
in deir own countries; but I have
tought dat de Craike language was
spoke
only in de Morea, and a little in
Russia
,
and
Constantinople
.
The Captain
assured
him, the principal
favouring the
mistake
, by a grave face,
and bowing as the Captain
spoke
, that it
was
absolutely
the vernacular language of
these
people.
Why den,
said
the other, do dey not
get
professors
from
amongst
dese
, to tache
Craike in deir Colleges?
Because
,
said
the Captain, we have been
heretofore on
hostile
terms with
these
Indians
;
and it is but of late that we have
made a peace. But now, it is to be
presumed
,
we
shall
have it in our power to
procure from them able teachers.
The
professor
was alarmed at this; as
supposing
it would
supercede
the
necessity
of his
services
; or, at
least
, much reduce
the price of his tuition. He could have
wished
he had not come to this quarter of
the world; and was
almost
ready, in his
own mind, to bind up what he had, and
go back to Clogher.
So ended their
visit
to the
University
,
and the Captain withdrew.
CHAP. VII.
Containing an Anecdote.
IT may be thought a
preposterous
idea,
that it could, for a moment, be
supposed
possible
, that the
pedeseque
could
have had the
assurance
to
pass
himself
for
a Grecian. But I had it from the Marquis
de la Luzerne, that a friend of his, who
was in
some
public capacity at
Moscow
;
and was entertained by a principal
inhabitant
of the city, was
asked
by him, to
visit
an academy, where the French language
was taught; and at which his
son
, a young
lad, then was. What was the
surprise
of the gentleman, to find a Pady from
Cork, who
understood
not a
single
word of
French, or Latin, teaching an unknown
gibberish
, which
most
probably was
Irish
?
Vol. II. I
CHAP. VIII.
OUR Chevalier was now at his wits
end; not being able to conceive of
any other place of
amusement
, in which
Teague might be found; when all at
once it came into his head, (led to it,
perhaps, from the reference, in his late
conversation
, to the Indian tribes,) that
probably he might have fallen in with the
Indian treaty-man, and have been
prevailed
upon to
personate
a chief. It
appeared
to him therefore
adviseable
to go
directly to the
secretary
at war, to know
if any party of Indians had been lately
there to negociate a treaty.
Being introduced, and after
some
ceremony
,
accosting
the
secretary
, he gave
him to
understand
why it was that he had
the honour to wait upon him, viz. that he
had a
servant
of the name of Teague
O'Regan
,
an
Irishman
, who had been
absent
some
days, and that from a
circumstance
which happened in the way to the city, he
had
reason
to
suspect
, he might have been
picked up by a certain Indian treaty-man,
to
supply
the place of a Welch
blacksmith
,
who had died, and had
passed
for a chief
of the Kickapoos.
The
secretary
was a good deal chagrined,
believing the Captain to be
some
wag that
had come to make this enquiry by way of
burlesque
on the Indian treaties; and
with
some
irritation of mind, gave him
to
understand
, that there had been no
Indian
treaty-man, or Kickapoo chief there;
that no treaty had been held with the
Indians
for above a month
past
,
since
the
king of the Togamogans had drawn goods;
but treaty or no treaty, it ill became him
in the appearance of a gentleman, to throw
a
burlesque
upon government, by
insinuating
that his
Irishman
could be
imposed
upon them for a chief.
I mean no
burlesque
,
said
the Captain,
a little irritated in his turn; I have had too
much trouble to keep him from the Indian
treaty-man that was coming here, to be
disposed
to
jest
with
so
serious
an affair.
The hair-breadth
escape
of going to
Congress
,
or being licenced as a preacher, or
being
chosen
as a member of the
philosophical
society
, was nothing to this, as it
was
so
difficult to guard
against
it, the
Indian
recruiters imitating
savages
, not only
in their
dress
and painting, but in the
dexterity
to way-lay and
surprise
.
I
wish
youto know,
sir
,
said
the
secretary
,
that I comprehend your
burlesque
very
well. But though you and others may
misrepresent
our policy in the Indian
treaties
,
it is
base
irony and ridicule to
insinuate
that the Indians we treat with, are
not chiefs.
Chiefs, or no chiefs,
said
the Capain, I
am not
saying
, nor care; but only
wish
to
know if you have been
instituting
any
treaty with my Teague, who has been
absent
some
days.
I will be much obliged to you to
withdraw
from my office,
said
the
secretary
.
I
shall
withdraw,
said
the Captain; and
not with that
respect
for your
understanding
and
politeness
, which I could have
wished
to entertain. I have
addressed
you
with civility; and I was entitled to a civil
answer
; but I
see
the
insolence
of office,
is well enumerated, by the poet,
amongst
the evils that make us
sick
of life. Your
humble
servant
Monsieur
Secretary; I
shall
trouble you no further.
CHAP. IX.
RETURNING to the Indian Queen,
a play bill, for the evening, had
announced
the performance of the tragedy
of Macbeth, and a farce called the Poor
Solider. A party of the gentlemen, from
the public
house
, had taken a box; and
the Captain agreed to go with them to
the play. Having delivered their tickets,
and being admitted to the box, it
struck
the Captain to
cast
his eye upon the pit
and galleries, and
observe
if he could any
way
descry
the
physiognomy
of Teague.
As before, when with the
same
view he
surveyed
the members of
Congress
, he
could
discover
several
that a good deal
resembled
him; but yet not the identical
person
. The curtain being now drawn
the play began. Nothing material occured
during the performance of the tragedy,
save
that when the witches came in, there
was one in her cap and
broomstick
whose
features a good deal
resembled
the
Irishman's
,
and who, had
she
not been an old
I 2
woman and a witch, might have
passed
for
Teague. The Captain was
struck
with the
resemblance
of feature, and long frame of
the bog-trotter, covered with a
short
gown
and petticoat; and borrowing a
glass
from
one that
sat
in the box with him,
endeavoured
to reconnoitre more perfectly, and
could have
sworn
that it was the mother,
or
sister
of Teague, that had
just
came
from Ireland, and joined the company.
The tragedy being ended, the farce
began
to be acted, and who
should
come
forward
in the character of Darby, but the
long
sought
for Teague. The fact was,
he had before appeared in the tragedy, in
the character of an over-grown red-headed
witch. It was more natural for him to
appear in the character of Darby his own
countryman; for he
spake
with the brogue
naturally, and not by imitation. The
managers
had had him all the while of his
absence
from the Captain, under tuition,
teaching him his part, which was not
difficult
to do; the manner and pronunciation
being already his own.
It was this had induced the managers to
take him up, as a
substitute
; the
person
who actually played the part of Darby,
being
,
at this time, out of the way. As the
natural
squal
of a pig is
superior
to an
imitation
of it;
so
it was allowed by the
audiance
,
that Teague exceeded the
pseudo
Irishman
that
usually
performed this part.
All were
pleased
but the Captain,
whose
sense
of propriety could
scarcely
restrain
him from throwing his cane at the
begtrotter
.
Thought he with
himself
, what
avails it that I prevented him from taking
a
seat
in a
legislative
body, or from
preaching
,
or being a
philosopher
; if after all,
he has
relinquished
my
service
, and turned
player; a thing, no doubt, fitter for him,
than the being a
senator
, or clergyman,
or
philosopher
;
because
he can appear in
some
low character in the farce or comedy,
and come off tolerably enough. For though
amongst
the dramatis
person
of learned
bodies, there are Tony Lumpkins, and
Darby M`Faddins in abundance, yet there
ought to be none; and Teague had better
be on the
stage
than in
such
capacities,
since
he
must
be
some
where. But to
leave me without notice, after all my
civilities
to him, is ungrateful, and
deserves
all that I can
say
bad concerning him. I
shall
give
myself
no farther trouble on this
head; but let him take his
course
. I
must
endeavour to find another
servant
who can
supply
his place.
BOOK VI.
CHAP. I.
THE foregoing had been the reflections
of the Captain during the exhibition
of the farce. But the play being ended,
and having come home, the next day he
began to put his
resolution
in practice;
and to think how he could
supply
himself
with another
servant
. It
struck
him to
purchase
a negro; and mentioning this to
the company, at
breakfast
, at the Indian
Queen, one of the people called
Quakers
,
who was
present
, and overheard the
conversation
, made an apology for the
liberty he took in making
some
objections
.
Friend,
said
he, thee appears to
be a
discreet
man, from thy behaviour,
and
conversation
; and if thee will not be
offended, I would
ask
if thee
canst
reconcile
it with thy principles, to keep a
slave
. As to that,
said
the Captain, I have
thought upon the
subject
, and do not
see
any great harm in the matter. If we look
to inanimate nature, we
shall
find, that
the great law is Force. The
Cartesians
call it
pressure
and
suction
: The
Newtonians
call it attraction and gravitation.
The
sun
, the
largest
body in the
universe
,
endeavours to draw all towards it; while
the
lesser
globes
struggle
to fly off at a
tangent. The
dense
air takes place of the
rare; and the heavier particles of water
cause
the lighter to recede. The tall oak
overshades
the under wood. There is a
predominancy, and
subordination
in all
things. In the animal creation, the weaker
is always
subject
to the
strong
; who even
devour them, when the
flesh
suits
their
appetite: and the very teeth and jaw-bone
of carnivorous animals,
shew
the intention
of nature, that they
should
make a prey
of living creatures. Do you blame
yourselves
,
when you
subjugate
elephants, or
horses
, or oxen of the plough, to your
use
? What right have you to invade the
liberty of a playful young colt, more than
of an African inhabitant? Or have you
not as good a right to take up a negro, and
put him to your work, as you have to cut a
calf, and manufacture him for the draft?
In this
case
, there is a difference,
said
the Quaker; a negro is a human creature,
and
possesses
all the natural rights of man.
That may be,
said
the Captain. But
what are the natural rights of men? Are
they not finally
resolvable
, as in the
inanimate
world, into power on the one hand,
and
weakness
on the other.
Who is it that
abstains
from dominion,
when he has it in his power to
assert
it?
Power is the great law of nature; and
nothing
but the pacts or conventions of
society
can contravene it. I
should
think
myself
justifiable
in making any man a
slave
to
answer
my
purposes
, provided I treated him
well while he was
such
. This I take to be
the only condition which the law of
reason
annexes to the enjoyment of
such
property.
I may be warranted in taking, and
managing
an animal of the
horse
kind; but it is
my
indisputable
duty not to
abuse
him by
causing
him to
suffer
famine, or endure
too much toil. The
same
with any other
animal that I
enslave
; there is a tacit
condition
annexed to the grant which the law
of nature gives, viz. That the
service
be
exacted with moderation; and proper
nourishment
be provided. I admit
also
,
that humanity would dictate that a
slave
ought to be
consulted
as much as is
consistent
with my convenience. For
instance
;
if I had the Grand Turk in my power, as
he has been
accustomed
to a
soft
and
effeminate
way of living, it would be hard to
put him all at once to maul rails, or
clearing
out meadow ground, or the like; or if
it
should
fall in my way to have Catherine
of
Russia
in that capacity, as
she
is a
women
of an elevated mind, it would be
inhumane
to put her to the
lowest
drudgery,
such
as
scrubing
out rooms, and carrying
water from the pump; but rather indulge
her if I could afford it, with a more
easy
employment,
especially
as
she
is an old
woman
,
of knitting
stockings
and carding
wool. There is no man would be more
disposed
to treat a
slave
with
tenderness
than
myself
; but to deny me of my right
altogether of making one, or of trafficking
for one when made, is carrying the matter
too far.
So much for the right of
enslaving
. But
if we put it on the principle of what will
conduce to the aggregate
happiness
of
mankind, we
shall
find it to be, that there
should
be
master
and
servant
, or in other
words, owner and
slave
. The economy
of nature
illustrates
this, in the
subserviency
of one thing to another: But,
independent
of any
illustration
, it
must
be known
on reflection, and is felt in experience, that
all are not competent to all things; and
in the
case
of temporary
servants
, much
time is taken up in contracting with them
for their remanence; and it is a
considerable
time before they get into the habit
of our
service
; and having it in their
power
to retire from us, when inclination may
direct, there is an
insecurity
in the
attachment
.
But as the
slave
has the
master
always to provide for him;
so
master
has the
slave
always to
subserve
him: and
thus, by a conjoint
interest
, the felicity
of both is promoted, and the
sum
of
human
happiness
increased
. Hence it is,
that
most
nations have made
use
of
slaves
.
The patriarch Abraham, had
threescore
and ten
servants
born in his
house
. What
were
these
but
slaves
? The Jews, his
descendants
,
had bond-men, and
bond-women
: Were not
these
slaves
? The Roman
slaves
were more in number than the
citizens
;
and
amongst
the Greeks, the
most
virtuous of them, viz. the Spartans, kept
in their
service
the
most
depressed
of all
slaves
, the Helotes; who, when we
consider
the black broth, the food, and
severe
life of the
masters
,
must
have lived
on poor fare, and in a laborious
service
indeed.
But it may be
said
, that example of
wrong never
constitutes
right. Grant it;
but if you examine the capacities, and
even
inclinations of men, will you not find,
that
some
are qualified only to be
slaves
.
They have not
understanding
to act for
themselves
. Nor do all love freedom,
even
when they have it. Do not many
surrender
it; and prefer
kissing
a great man's
backside
, to being independent? It is not
always, even from the views of advantage,
that men are
sycophants
; but from an
abstract
pleasure
in being drawn into the
vortex of others. There is a
pleasure
in
slavery
, more than
unenslaved
men know.
Why is it, that, even after the
convulsion
of a revolution in a government, in
favour
of liberty, there is a natural
tendency
to
slavery
; and it finally terminates in
this point. The fact is, a
state
of liberty
is an unnatural
state
. Like a bone out of
place, the mind, in an individual, or
political
capacity,
seeks
the condition of a
master
or
servant
; avoiding, as the
particular
Vol. II. K
propensity
may be, the one or the
other
.
There cannot be a greater proof that
this is founded in nature, than the common
moral
observation
, that the
greatest
tyrants,
that is, the
worst
masters
, make the
most
abject
slaves
: And,
vice
versa
,
that the
most
subservient
of mankind, when you give
them power, make the
worst
use
of it: All
this
because
, in
these
cases
, the
persons
are
misplaced
, and not in their proper
stations
.
Julius
Cesar
made a humane generous
master
;
but he would have made a very
intriguing
,
troublesome
valet de chambre. It
would have been
impossible
to have got any
good of him. On the other hand, Tiberius
would have made an excellent
hostler
, and
taken a beating, with as much
resignation
,
as a
house
beagle, who is
used
to it. So
that it evidently is the
provision
of nature,
that there are materials of
slavery
; and
the fault of
those
, whom
she
intends for
masters
, if they do not make
slaves
. But
as it is difficult to determine,
a priori,
who
are intended for
slavery
or freedom,
so
as to make a judicious
distribution
, things
must
take their
course
; and the rule be,
catch, catch can; and every man have a
servant
when he can get one. It is in
vain to be
squeamish
, and
stick
at colour.
It is true, I would rather have a white
person
, if
such
could be got; as I prefer
white to black;
especially
in the
summer
season
, as being a more light and airy
colour
.
Thy
reasoning
,
said
the Quaker, is more
rhetorical than logical; and thy analogies
of nature, and
historical
proofs, cannot
so
far
oppress
the light within, as to make
me think, that it is given to thee, or me,
to make
slaves
of our
species
.
As to that,
said
the Captain, I am not
clear that a negro is of our
species
. You
may claim kindred with him, if you
please
; but I
shall
not.
I
shall
not
dispute
that with thee,
said
the Quaker: for I perceive thee does not
give credit to what the book
says
of the
first
man, and his
descendants
: But will
thee not grant me, that the African,
though not of the
same
stock
, is, at
least
a man; that is of the human genus,
though the
species
of the white and the
black may not be the
same
; if
so
,
hast
thou more right to
enslave
him, than he
thee?
Grant it,
said
the Captain; for my
reasoning
tends to that, and
resolves
the right
into the power.
If
so
,
said
the Quaker, thee may be the
slave
in thy turn.
Doubtless
,
said
the Captain; and it is
not of
so
much
consequence
who is
slave
,
as that there be one. It is better that the
foot be foot, and the head be head; but
if there is a
conversion
,
nevertheless
, let
there be head and foot. It is
necessary
that there be domination and
subjection
,
in order to produce a compound
improvement
and advantage.
You could
see
by the Quaker's
countenance
,
that he thought the
reasoning
sophistical
;
but as he did not know very well
what he could
say
more, he was
silent
.
CHAP. II.
Containing Remarks.
IT is thought by
some
, the Captain was
not
serious
in thus advocating the
cause
of
slavery
. Be that as it may, he
omitted
some
serious
arguments, that
naturally
present
themselves
on that
side
on which
he
reasoned
: For
instance
, it
strikes
me
at
first
blush
, that there can be no moral
wrong in catching a young African, and
bringing him away from his own
happiness
to
pursue
ours. For if there were, is
it to be
supposed
, that humane and
just
persons
, would promote and
support
the
evil
,
by
purchasing
such
negro, or
retaining
him, and his offspring, when
purchased
.
For, on the principle that the
receiver
is the thief, or, to
speak
more
strictly
,
a thief, the
purchaser
of the African
takes the guilt along with the
possession
;
and, in the language of the law, every act
of retainer is a new
trespass
. For the evil
K 2
of the original act, if there be evil in it,
cannot be rendered pure by the filtration
of
purchase
, and retaining. So that the
holder of the negro, in the tenth
transmission
,
is an aider, or abettor, of the
original
act of taking; if I may
use
the word
aider, or abettor, in a
case
of
trespass
;
where, by the definition of the law, all
who any ways concur in the act, and
further
it, are
principals.
The holder of a
negro
must
, therefore, look back to that
act which
first
made him, or an
ancestor
,
a
slave
; and if he cannot
justify
this, he
cannot
justify
the retaining him in
servitude
:What
a
consequence
must
this be!
There is no man that pretends to
humanity
,
much
less
to religion, would be
safe
in being the
possessor
of a
slave
. The only
way therefore to get rid of the difficulty is
to
justify
,
ab origine,
traffic in all
such
property
.
That it is
justifiable
I have no doubt.
Is there any religious denomination,
except
the fanatical people called Quakers,
that have made it a term of communion
not to hold a
slave
. In admitting to
church privileges, I have never heard,
of the
question
asked
, Have you any
negroes
,
and do you keep
slaves
? If it was
a matter of
conscience
, would not
conscientious
persons
themselves
make it.
The
assemblies
or
synods
of the
Presbyterian
church, or conventions of the
Episcopal
,
in America, have
said
nothing on
this
subject
. Is an
omission
of this kind
reconcilable with the idea, that it is a
natural evil, or a moral wrong.
In the phrenzy of the day,
some
weak
minded powers, in Europe, begin to
consider
what is called the African trade as a
moral wrong, and to provide for a
gradual
abolition of it. If they will
abolish
it, I approve of its being done gradually;
because
, numbers being embarked in this
trade, it
must
ruin them all at once, to
desist
from it. On this principle, I have
always thought it a defect in the criminal
codes of
most
nations, not giving licence
to the perpetrators of offences, to proceed,
for a limited time, in larcenies, burglaries,
&c. until they get their hands out of
use
to
these
pursuits
, and in
use
to others. For
it
must
be greatly inconvenient to thieves
and cut-throats, who have engaged in this
way of life, and
spent
time, and expended
money, and run great
risks
in acquiring
skill
in their employment, to be obliged
all at once to withdraw their hands, and lay
aside
picking locks, and apply
themselves
to
industry
in other ways, for a
livelihood
.
The law of
Pennsylvania
on this
principle
,
has provided for the
gradual abolition
of the
slavery
of negroes. For
those
who
have got them could not do without them,
no more than a robber could do without
the money that he takes, being
pressed
by
some
great
necessity
to make
use
of that
expedient to recruit his
purse
. All
those
therefore who have been originally taken
from the
coast
of Africa, and deprived of
liberty, or
descended
from
such
, and
inheriting
slavery
, when recorded agreeably
to the act in
question
, continue
slaves
, and
for life, and their offspring to a certain
period. But were we to entramel the
case
with
political
or
moral
doubts
respecting
the original right of caption, and
subjugation
,
the difficulty would
exist
of
reconciling
it with
natural right to hold a
slave
for a moment, even whether the law
sanctioned
it or not;
in which
case
we
should
find it
necessary
to go as far as the fanatics in
religion, and
set
our
slaves
free altogether.
It is from not duly attending to this
circumstance
,
that
abstract
reasoners
talk of
abolition; a doctrine which, however
absurd
,
is becoming the whim of the day;
and the
phrensy
seems
to gain
such
ground,
that I would not wonder if they would
next
assert
that it is unlawful to
use
the
servitude
of
horses
, or other
beasts
of
burden
,
as having a natural right, to live in
the fields, and be as free as mankind. The
best
way to avoid extremes, is to check
the principle; I hold the right of
absolute
subjugation
, of whites, blacks, and browns
of all nations,
against
gradual abolition,
or any abolition
whatsoever
. This being
the only
consistent
principle,
short
of an
absolute
emancipation, made
instantly
; for
in no
mean
is there
reason
, or a
rest
for
conscience
.
That it is of importance to
settle
the
consciences
of
sober
minded
persons
in
Pennsylvania
,
clergymen, and members of the
Presbyterian
church
especially
, who have
negroes,
must
be well known from that
tenderness
of
conscience
, for which
such
are remarkable. Some, indeed, carry their
ideas of the extent of duties
so
far, as not
to omit grace to meat, or the formal
worship
of prayer, reading chapters, and
singing
psalms
, on the
set
occasions
, on any
consideration
whatsoever
; what is more,
will not
shave
a beard, on the Sabbath day,
for a cow. Now,
should
they, by any
means, come once to think of the
wickedness
of
enslaving
men, there would be no
getting them to keep a negro. For
those
of this denomination; and, indeed,
most
,
or all others of the
Christian
, hold, that
the Africans, though of a
sable
race, is
of their own
species
; being
descended
from Adam. This being the
case
, a
slight
matter, the bare directing their attention to
the
subject
, would alarm pious people, and
lead them to the favourite maxim of the
gospel
Do to others, as you would
have others to do to you.
As
opposed
to the
enfranchisement
of
negroes
,
generally, and in
Pennsylvania
in
particular, I have been under
apprehensions
,
that
some
of our young lawyers in
the courts, might plead the
constitution
of
the
state
, by which it is
established
that
all
men
are born equally free and
independent
.
Now admitting that a negro is
a man, how
shall
any
master
retain him as
a
slave
? On a habeus corpus, he
must
be
set
at liberty. At
least
I cannot conceive
how the judge could remand him to his
drudgery. The
constitution
is the law
paramount, and framed by a convention of
the people, recognizing the original right
of freedom in a negro, allowing him to
be a man; and caries us above the act of
the
legislature
for the gradual abolition,
&c. which by implication
seems
to
suppose
that negroes may be
slaves
:
An implication
inconsistent
with the
power
exercised
by the law. For if negroes
were
slaves
, and
so
the
property
of
those
who claimed them, could the
legislature
affect that property, without
indemnification
to the
masters
?
I
shall
say
no more on this head,
lest
I
should
furnish
hints to pettifoggers, who
may make an ill
use
of their information.
CHAP. III.
JUST at this moment a waiter coming
in, told him there was a
person
without
,
that is, in the bar room, who
wished
to
speak
with him. Going out, who
should
strike
his optics, but Teague.
The fact was, being elated with the
success
of his performance on the
stage
,
attributing
that to art which was nature
itself
,
he had counted more upon his
accomplishments
than he ought to have done,
and had made advances to the
mistress
of
the manager, who was
also
an
actress
, and
not greatly coveting an amour with the
bog-trotter, made a merit of the
circumstance
,
to induce an opinion of fidelity, and
informed the manager of the
presumption
of the
Irishman
. The manager in the
most
unbecoming manner, without either
citation, examination, trial, conviction,
or judgment, but laying
aside
all forms of
law, had
instituted
an original
process
of
himself
, and laying hold of a
horse
-whip,
had applied this implement to the back and
shoulders
of Teague, and as the
Irishman
made an effort of
resistance
at the
first
onset
,
the manager had been under the
necessity
,
by turning the but end of the whip,
to knock him down, which he did by a
stroke
above the left eye-brow, which not
only bereft him of
senses
for the
present
,
but a
discolouration
of the eye for
some
days, and a
scar
probably his whole life
after.
It was this incident had induced him
to leave the theatre, and brought him
back to the Captain, whom he now
accosted
in the following manner: Dear
master
,
for the love of
shalvation
, forgive a poor
sharvant
that has been killed this marning
with a great cudgel,
just
for nothing at all,
but not
plasing
a damned whore, that
wanted me to
stale
the manager's
cloathing
,
and go off wid her. This is all that
a poor
sharvant
gets by being
hanest
; but
by
shant
Patrick, and the holy
crass
, it is
what I
deserve
for leaving the
sarvice
of
a good
master
, as your anour, and taking
up with bog-tratters, and
stage
players,
that would
sooner
take a cup of wine than
the holy
sacrament
, and get drunk every
Vol. II. L
night in de wake, and go to de devil
head
foremost
; but if your honour, dear
master
, will forgive the
past
, and my
running
away, and laving you, I will come
back again, and
sarve
you to the day of
judgment, or any langer time that your
honour
plases
, and clane your boots and
spurs
, and rub down the bay
harse
; the
poor old crature, how aften I have tought
of him when I was in my rambles and he
was a
slape
,
laste
they
should
chare him of
his oats, and give him nather hay nor
straw
to ate; for I always liked to take
care of a good
harse
, and a good
master
;
and aften tought of your honour, when
I was among the bog-tratters of the
stage
,
and gave you a good name, and was
always
talking of you and forgot my part,
and put the managers in a
passion
, who
fell upon me, and bate me like a dog.
The Captain
saw
the
inconsistency
in the
relation; one while alleging the tale
bearing
of the
mistress
, as the
occasion
of it;
again, a deficiency in the recital of his
part; but expecting no truth from the
Irishman
,
cared very little how it came to
pass
. The principal thing that occupied
his thoughts, was whether to receive the
bog-trotter, or
dismiss
him. He reflected
with
himself
on the trouble he had had
with him, on his various
pretensions
to
advancement; his
uneasiness
of mind, and
fatigue of body, for
several
days
past
, in
examining
stews
,
methodistical
conventicles
,
rumaging
philosophical
societies
,
attending
elections, and
listening
to the
debates
of
Congress
, to
see
if he could any
where
observe
his
physiognomy
, or
distinguish
his brogue. He could not think
of
subjecting
himself
to
such
uncertainty
in the attendance of any
servant
, with
such
preposterous
ideas, as being a
legislator
,
philosopher
, &c. Again, he
considered
,
that probably this
last
chastisement
he had
received, might have a good effect, in
curing
him of the freaks of his ambition;
and a mind broken and reduced by
disappointment
,
is in a mellow
state
, and more
capable of receiving the
seeds
of good
advice
,
than a mind full of vanity or pride,
that has never yet received blows.
Deliberating
on
these
grounds, his humanity
prevailed, and he determined to receive the
raggamuffin into favour.
This being
settled
, and learning from
the
Irishman
in what manner he had been
inveigled, and drawn away by the
manager
,
to go upon the
stage
; and that it was
only
because
Teague had made advances
to a woman that was a whore already,
that the manager had made
such
an attack
upon his
person
, he
wished
to
punish
him,
if it
should
appear to be within the
province
of the law to do it. Accordingly,
inquiring what principal lawyer there was
in that city, was informed of a certain
counsellor
Grab. Taking Teague with him,
he
set
out to
consult
this gentleman.
Counsellor
Grab was in his office,
amongst
large
shelves
of books, or
shelves
of large
books; not, as the Latins
say
,
Co-opertus,
aut obrutus,
sed
comitatus libris;
that is,
In the
midst
of his books. He had on a
pair of
spectacles
, not
so
much on account
of age, as to make the client believe that
he laboured under a premature want of
sight
, from much reading; or,
because
a
pair of
lenses
, magnifying the organs of
vision
, gives the appearance of a larger eye,
which has a good effect on the
person
consulting
,
impressing
the idea of a broader
view of things that are before it.
Entering, the Captain
addressed
himself
to the
counsellor
, and gave him the
outlines
of the injury done to Teague; The
counsellor
, in the mean time,
suspending
his reading in a large book, which he had
before him, printed in Saxon letter, and
raising
his head, until the
glasses
of his
spectacles
were brought to bear upon the
physiognomy
of the Captain.
The Captain having
finished
his
account
,
referred him to Teague, the
subject
of the battery, for a a more particular
detail of the
circumstances
. Teague was
glad of the opportunity of
speaking
before
a learned lawyer, and was beginning to
give a relation of the whole affair; but
the Captain
stopped
him, bidding him wait
until the lawyer
should
himself
request
him
to begin. The lawyer was
silent
: after
having reconnoitered with his
glasses
, one
while the Captain, another while Teague,
he dropped his optics, and began to read
again. The Captain, thinking he had not
been
sufficiently
understood
, recommenced
the narration, and gave an account of
what he
himself
had
suffered
from the
inveigling
and detaining his
servant
, and
the
visible
injury which the
servant
himself
had
sustained
. The lawyer was
still
silent
; and, though he had eyed him while
speaking
, as a
Tuscan
astronomer
would
the moon, yet he applyed
himself
again to
the reading the black letter, that was
before
him.
L 2
The Captain thought it
strange
treatment
;
and was, for
some
time, at a
loss
to know what to think of the matter. But
recollecting, opportunely, that the
circumstance
of a fee had been omitted, he took
out his
purse
, and threw down two
dollars
.
The lawyer
seemed
a little moved,
but
cast
his eye again upon the black
letter
.
Finding the two dollars not
sufficient
,
the Captain threw down two more.
The
counsellor
raised
his head from the
book, and you might
discern
some
dilitation
of the
muscles
of the face, as
bespeaking
an approaching opening of the
voice; but
still
there was
silence
; and
might have been to this hour, had not the
Captain recollected, at this moment, what
he had all along forgot, that half a joe
was the fee of a lawyer. Doubling,
therefore
,
the four dollars that were already
down, the lawyer came to his voice, the
organs of his
speech
were
loosed
, and
taking
the
glasses
from his eyes, he gave his
counsel
as follows:
Said he, You have a double remedy in
this
case
;
against
the manager who
inveigled
,
and
against
the
servant
himself
:
Against
the
servant
, on the act of
Assembly
,
if indented; at common law, on the
contract to
serve
. For even a
servant
at
will, and not engaged for any
special
time, is not at liberty to
desert
the
service
of his
master
, without
reasonable
notice
first
given. So that you may have your
remedy
against
the
servant
, in the
first
instance
, by bringing the matter before
the court of quarter
sessions
; and having
time put upon him, as the
phrase
is, for
this dereliction of your
service
; or, an
action on the contract,
express
or implied,
as the
case
may be, wherein he
shall
repair
,
in damages, the
loss
sustained
.
The bog-trotter was alarmed at the idea
of an action
against
him; and looking
wistfully
at his
master
, exclaimed; Dear
master
, will you trow de law upon me,
dat am as innocent as a
shild
unborn; and
would go to death and damnation for you.
Dear
master
, I
suffered
enough by de
cudgel
of dat player, for all de running away
I have done; and, God love your
shoul
,
keep de law in its own place, and not let
it come
acrass
a poor
sharvant
, that has
nathing but as he works and trats about;
but let
dese
grate big books of his honour
de lawyer,
spake
to de manager, for his
deceiving a poor
sharvant
, and putting it
in his head to run away, and lave a good
master
; and his beating him with a grate
cudgel into the bargain.
I have no
desire
,
said
the Captain, to
pursue
the bog-trotter; as he has made
acknowledgments for his fault; but would
want the
utmost
rigour of the law to be
put in force
against
the player.
You have
also
in this
case
a double
remedy
,
said
the
counsellor
; by
prosecution
on the part of the
servant
, and on your
part. Nay, the
servant
himself
has a
double
remedy; for he may
prosecute
by
indictment
,
or bring his action of
assault
and battery; or both. I would
recommend
the action only;
because
, where no
indictment
is
prosecuted
, and the civil action
only brought, exemplary damages may be
given, as well as reparatory. For in the
civil action, it will affect the minds of a
jury, that the party has already
suffered
all
that is in the nature of
punishment
by a
criminal proceeding; and nothing remains
with them, but to give reparatory
damages
.
On the part of the
master
, two kinds
of action may be brought; either an
action
of
trespass
,
vi et armis,
laying a
perquod
servitium
amisit
;
or
simply
an action
on the
case
, for the
consequential
damage
of inveigling the
servant
.
As to the number of remedies
said
the
Captain, or the kind of them, I care very
little how many there are, or what they
are; I want only a good remedy; give
me a good
swingeing
one
against
the
rascal
,
and I care very little what it is called.
I
shall
then,
said
the
counsellor
,
advise
simply
an action on the
case
; and count
generally
on the inveigling, and detaining,
and rendering unfit for
service
while in
his power. In this mode, the whole
circumstances
of the injury may be brought
together, and
summed
up into one point
of view; and enhancing the quantum of
damages
,
can expatiate on the value of your
servant
, and the
special
occasion
you had
for his
service
, at this particular juncture;
for I make no doubt he is a valuable
servant
;
and that it has been an
almost
irreparable
injury to you, to have been
defrauded
of his
service
at this time.
As to his value,
said
the Captain, there
can be no doubt, not only as a
servant
,
but in other
respects
. I have been offered,
or at
least
I
suppose
I could have got, an
hundred pounds for him, to be a
member
of
Congress
, or to preach, or to go to
the
Philosophical
Society, or to be an
Indian
treaty-man; but have
refused
every
proposal
made him, or me, for
these
purposes
;
and now to have him kidnapped,
and taken off, without fee or reward, and
employed as an actor, and beat, and
rendered
useless
, at
least
for
some
time, into
the bargain, is too much for any man to
put up with. If there is law in the land, let
it be put in force; and this man made
an example.
The
counsellor
had no need of
spectacles
,
to give
himself
the appearance of a
glaring and broad look, on this
occasion
;
for the words of the Captain made him
stare
sufficiently
, without the aid of a
magnifying
medium, to enlarge his optics.
He began to take him for a madman;
at
least
, in
some
degree, deranged in his
brain; to talk of his
servant
being in
request
for a member of
Congress
, and the
like.
Yes, continued the Captain, he not
only
inveigled away a
servant
, that was
thought fit to be a member of
Congress
,
and a preacher, and an Indian
treaty-maker
,
and a
philosopher
, and what not;
but has kept me,
these
three days, trotting
after him, and trying to find him, at
election
places, and in
Congress
boarding-houses
,
and the hall where they have their
debates, and churches, and pulpits, and
chambers of
philosophical
societies
, and
professorships
, and where not; to
see
if
I could find him; while this manager had
him, in the mean time, at
rehearsals
,
teaching him the art of mimickry, for the
stage
.
The
counsellor
, in the mean time, had
reflected with
himself
, that, whether
madman
,
or no madman, the Captain had
money, and might be a good client, let
his
cause
be what it would; and
so
composing
the
muscles
of his face,
seemed
to
agree with him; and
observe
, that
doubtless
the quality and capacity of the
servant
would be taken into view, in
estimating
the damages: That, if it appeared he was
not only fit
stuff
for a
servant
; but to be
advanced to
such
eminent offices as
these
,
not only the inveigling the embryo
legislator
,
preacher, and
philosopher
; but the
assaulting
and beating him, and, by that
means,
disabling
him from immediate
service
,
must
be viewed in the light of an
atrocious injury, and
insure
a verdict
accordingly
.
Very well,
said
the Captain; and I
shall
wish
to have the matter determined as
speedily
as
possible
, as I may be but a few
days in town; and,
besides
, as the marks
are yet apparent on the face, and, I
suppose
,
back, of the bog-trotter, it will
appear
to the judges, and jury, without the
trouble of
witnesses
, what damage he has
sustained
.
The
process
of law,
said
the
counsellor
,
is tedious, but certain; you cannot expect
a trial, in this
case
, until the 3d or 4th
term; that is, nine months, or a year.
How
so
,
said
the Captain?
Because
,
said
the
counsellor
, it is now two months, or
upwards, before the court to which the
writ will be returnable. Even if a
declaration
is then filed, the defendant may
imparl until the
succeeding
term, which
is three months; when if there is no
demurer
general or
special
, a rule to plead
will be taken, which may not be put in
until the
succeeding
term of three months
again: At this term, if there is no
replication
,
rejoinder,
surrejoinder
,
rebutter
,
or
surrebutter
, to draw up and file,
while the defendant may crave a term,
issue
will be joined, and at the next term
trial. But even after a verdict, there may
be the delay of a term, on a motion for a
new trial depending;
so
that in the law
there is delay; but this delay is the price
of
justice
.
It is a price,
said
the Captain, that I
will not give for it. If you will bring it
about in a
short
time to have this fellow
flogged, even with half the
stripes
he has
given my
servant
, I
shall
not think the
half joe thrown away; but to be a year or
half a year about the
business
, is putting
the matter
so
far off, that it may as well
be omitted altogether. If you could only
get him
sentenced
to take a kick or two
from my foot, or Teague's, before we leave
the city, I
should
be
satisfied
.
The
lex talionis,
said
the
counsellor
,
makes no part of our law. You can
punish
only in
estate
, not in
person
, for a
simple
assault
and battery, as this is. Do
you not hang a man for murder,
said
the
Captain; and why not
punish
personally
for
an
assault
and battery?
Because
it is our
law,
said
the
counsellor
; and, in a civil
action, the object is damages.
A civil action, and damages, are
strange
phrases
,
said
the Captain; how can
civility
and damages, be reconciled.
These
are technical terms,
said
the
counsellor
, which
persons
, not of the
prosession
,
are at
loss
to
understand
; but
Vol. II. M
have, in
themselves
, a
distinct
and
sensible
meaning.
Let the terms mean what they will,
said
the Captain, it all comes to this at
last
There is no getting at the manager,
under
a year, or two year's race for it;
before
which time, Teague will have forgot
the
abuse
he has received, and I my
trouble
in running after a
strayed
Irishman
,
through this city; and, therefore, it may
be as well to give the matter up, and
sit
down with the
loss
.
That as you
please
,
said
the
counsellor
;
and putting on his
spectacles
,
cast
his eye
again upon the black letter.
The Captain, without bidding him
kiss
his
backside
, beckoned to Teague to
follow
him, and withdrew from the
chamber
.
Having retired; Teague,
said
the
Captain
,
this thing of law has been well
said
to be a
bottomless
pit. The way to it is
like that to the
shades
;
Facilis
descensus
averni;
Sed
reserre
gradus, hic labor, hoc opus
est
.
This pettifogger
seemed
to have a
thousand
remedies at his command, and yet
none that would
serve
us; as the
redress
,
if any, is to be
postponed
to
such
a
distant
day. I have heard a great deal of
these
cattle, and I believe they are
best
off that
have
least
to do with them. They have
so
much jargon of technical terms, that
the devil
himself
cannot
understand
them.
Their whole object is to get money; and,
provided they can pick the pocket of half
a joe, they care little about the
person
that
consults
them. The
first
loss
is the
best
; you had better put up with the
currying
you have got, than have my pocket
picked, on pretence of
redress
a year or
two hence, which may, perhaps, prove a
century.
Teague was contented to put up with
the drubbing, and have no more
said
about
it.
CHAP. IV.
THE Captain had
consoled
himself
with the idea that Teague was now
cured of his folly, and would no more be
disposed
to entertain notions of ambition,
and
unreasonable
projects. He was
disappointed
in his hope; for that very
evening
,
the
Irishman
washing
down the
recollection
of his woes with
some
exhilerating
drink, and though not intoxicated, but
enlivened only, he came to the Captain:
Said he, Dear
master
, what would your
anour think, if a poor
sharvant
should
turn lawyer; and get a half joe when a
customer
comes to
consult
him in the
morning? would it not be better than
currying a
horse
, and tratting about like
a big dog; with no
sense
to live like a
man of fartune, and have a big
house
over
his head, and books about him, and
take half joes from paple that come to him
about their quarrels and batings, through
de town, and
sending
dem aff as
wise
as
if dey never had come to him, and de
great
spectacles
, to look like a blind man,
dat was blind before he was born, and
could
see
more than two or three other
paple, for all dat; and was a canjurer,
and a wizzard, and could take money for
nating. Would it not be better,
master
,
than tratting like a fool, and
disputing
wid
paple, and having nating to lay up; but
be as poor as a church
mouse
, or a rat, all
the days of our life, and paple laugh after
us when we are gone.
The Captain was thrown into a reverie
of thought, by the
speech
of the
bog-trotter
;
reflecting, that his
presumption
and folly was incurable; for,
notwithstanding
all that had been
said
to him, or
suffered
by him, his natural
propensity
remained
the
same
; according to the
maxim
Naturam expellas bufurca,
usque
recurret
;
You may
toss
out nature with a
pitchfork,
she
will
still
come back upon
you. Not
so
much from any further view
of reclaiming him, as from indignation,
and
resentment
,
against
his
presumption
,
the Captain projected, in his mind, a
farther
means of
chastising
him. He had
heard of a work-
house
, in this city, into
M 2
which refractory
servants
are committed,
and put to hard labour;
such
as pounding
hemp, grinding
plaister
of Paris, and
picking
old ropes into oakum. He
resolved
to
have the raggamuffin put into this a while.
Counterfeiting, therefore, an approbation
of his project of becoming lawyer,
doubtless
,
said
he, the
profession
of the law is a
profitable
business
, where money is very
easily
got, by the bare breath of the
mouth.
Nevertheless
, it requires time and
study
to qualify for this
profession
. Nay,
the introduction to the
study
, by being
put under an eminent lawyer, in full
practice
,
is
itself
very
expensive
. An hundred
pistoles
is
sometimes
the fee. This I could
not very well afford; but I have an
acquaintance
in this town, who, I am
persuaded
,
would be willing to oblige me,
and will take
less
. I will call upon him
early to-morrow, and
settle
the contract.
Accordingly the next day, calling on
the keeper of the work-
house
, he gave him
an account of his refractory
servant
, and
with a gratuity of a couple of guineas,
obtained
his
consent
, to take the bog-trotter
under his direction, and give him a few
lessons
in picking oakum, and grinding
plaister
of Paris, and pounding hemp, not
withholding, in the mean time, a
seasonable
application of the
cowskin
, in the intervals
of
study
of
these
several
branches of the
law. For the idea was to be
imposed
upon
Teague, that this was an office, or as
it were an inn of court, or chamber of
the Inner Temple; and that the
several
flagellations, and grindings, and
poundings
,
were
so
many
lessons
, and lectures,
to qualify him for the practice of the law.
It happened, fortunately, that the
keeper
of the work-
house
was well qualified
for the
task
; for, in early years, he had
been put an apprentice to an attorney, and
had
some
opportunity of attending courts,
and hearing the names of books to which
the advocates referred in their pleadings;
but having a turn for extravagance, and
a
dissolute
manner of life, he had come to
poverty, and, through various
scenes
, to
jail. There, by
address
, he had gained
the good will of the jailor's daughter,
whom he married; and, by the
interest
of
his new father-in-law, having obtained his
liberation, he was, from acting as deputy
jailor, in a
series
of time, at length
promoted
to be the keeper of this work-
house
.
Indeed, from his employment, being
acquainted
with the
prisoners
, and finding
himself
sometimes
interested
in their fate,
and being led to attend their trials, he
had, even in his
last
capacity, been a good
deal about courts, and heard law
phrases
and books mentioned.
Accordingly, when Teague was
introduced
,
which was that very afternoon, he
had, at his command, the names of the
abridgers, and reporters, and
commentators
of the law, and the technical terms in
the commencement and
process
of a
suit
;
so
that, when the key was turned, and,
after having
stript
him of the linen
doublet
that was upon him, he began to give
him the
first
application of the
cowskin
,
he told him this was reading Wood's
Institutes
;
and when, after this, he was
sentenced
to an hour or two's hard labour,
at grinding
plaister
of Paris, this was called
Coke upon Littleton; and when the
employment
was varied, pounding hemp, or
picking oakum, it was called Hawkin's
Pleas of the crown, or
Foster
, or 4th
Blackstone
, &c. When the poor
bog-trotter
,
reduced to a
skeleton
, living on
bread and water, complained of the hard
usage
, and offered
himself
a
servant
for
life, to curry
horses
and
brush
boots, to
any
Christian
creature that would take him
out of that place; he was told, that, as he
had begun the
study
of the law, he
must
go through with it; that that was but the
commencement of the
suit
; that in a year's
time he would learn to file a declaration;
in another, to put in a plea; in a third,
to join
issue
; and in a fourth, to conduct
a trial; that
unless
a bill of exceptions
had been filed, or there was a motion, in
arrest
of judgment, or a writ of error
brought, he might be admitted the fifth,
and begin to practice the
sixth
year: At
all events, provided he would
submit
himself
,
with due application, to
fasting
, and
cowskinning
, and grinding
plaister
of
Paris
,
pounding hemp, and picking oakum,
he might be a lawyer the
seventh
year,
and wear
spectacles
, like
counsellor
Grab,
and take half a joe when he thought
proper
.
I know not by what
simile
to
represent
the howl of the
Irishman
, at this
prospect
of
the duration of his woes. It was like that
of a wolf at the bottom of a well, or a
dog that had
lost
his
master
, or a cow
her comrade, or
some
forlorn wanderer
that has
missed
the way, and given up all
hopes of being extricated from the
wilderness
.
At the various applications of the
cowskin
, he had jumped, and
cursed
, and
swore
, and prayed, and
beseeched
, and
promised
a
thousand
services
, of currying
horses
, and
brushing
boots, and trotting
where ever he was ordered, provided they
would
set
him at liberty. When
employed
at the hard labour, before mentioned,
he had groaned, and
cursed
the law, the
counsellor
, and the half joe. Ah, thought
he, if my dear
master
, the Captain, knew
how hard a ting it was to
study
law, and
to
fast
widout ating or drinking, and be
bate wid a cow-
skin
, he would not have
given the hundred
pistoles
, nor the half
of it, to have had me kicked and cuffed
in dis manner: I would give body and
shoul
into the bargain, if I could
see
him
once more at that iron gate there, to
spake
to him, and
besache
him to take me out
of this purgatory. He was a good
master
;
and when I was a fool, and wanted to be
a member of
Congress
, and prache, and
be a
phalosophar
, he told me, Teague,
you are a fool; and what they would do
wid me there; how they would bate me,
and ate me, and take de
skin
aff my back,
and make a cow or a
shape
od me; and
now I am
worse
than a cow or a
shape
,
or a
horse
in de tame; for I am cut, and
curried, black and blue; till my
flesh
is
raw, and a cholic in my belly, wid
fasting
;
and all to
stoody
dis law. The devil take
counsellor
Grab, and de half joe.
CHAP. V.
THE Captain having been led to think
so
much of law, of late, was
struck
with the idea of
visiting
courts of
justice
,
and hearing
some
of
those
cases
argued,
which come before them.
Understanding
that a court was then
sitting
, he
resolved
to take the opportunity of the
interval
of Teague's purgation, in the
workhouse
,
to
amuse
himself
with the pleading
of the advocates. Accordingly, repairing
to the court
house
, he took his place
amongst
the crowd, and
listened
to what
was going forward.
What came before the court was a
motion
in
arrest
of judgment. A Jonathan
Mun had been indicted, and found guilty
of
feloniously
taking and carrying away
water out of the well of Andrew Mab.
It was moved in
arrest
of judgment, that
larceny could not be committed of water
in a well, it being real property; for it
was a
distinction
of the common law, that
larceny could not be committed of things
real, or
savouring
of the realty, Black. 232.
2 Ray. 470. Hawkins, &c. So that
taking
away the
soil
was merely a
trespass
;
and taking away the water could be no
more.
It was
answered
, that water being
fluitans
,
et mobilis,
could not be
considered
as real property; that an ejectment would
not lie for water, but for
so
many acres of
land covered with water, Yelv. 143. 1
Burr. 142.
Because
it was
impossible
to
give execution of a thing which is always
transient
and running, Run. 36. quotes
Cro. Jas. 150. Lev. 114. Sid. 151.
Thence it is that in a grant of the
soil
it is
necessary
, as we
see
from old forms, to add
the right of ways, woods, and
water-courses
, Lilly. Con. 132. and 179. Bridg.
Con. 321. That whatever might be
said
of water in its natural bed on the
soil
,
as water in a running
stream
; yet a well
being dug by the labour of hands, the
water thus acquired,
must
be counted as
personal
, not real property. Barbcray,
Titius, and Locke. That at a well, the
water being drawn up by the bucket, and
thus by one act
separated
from the
freehold
,
Vol. II. N
and by another taken from the
bucket
,
it becomes a
subject
of larceny; as in
the law of corn, trees, or
grass
growing.
For if
these
be
severed
at one time, and
at another time taken away, it is larceny.
Hawk. Pl. Cr. 93.
It was replied, that an ejectment would
lie of water in a well; for here the water
is fixed in a certain place, within the
bounds and
compass
of the well; and is
considered
as part of the
soil
. Run. 37.
That,
ex vi termini,
in the indictment,
out of the well, it
must
be
considered
as water
ex,
out of, or from the well;
that is, water
severed
by the very act of
taking; for
otherwise
it would have been
expressed
, by water out of the bucket
of Andrew Mab; not out of the well;
and
so
the taking could not be larceny,
but
trespass
; as in the
case
of a tree
that is cut down at one time, and taken
away at another; or apples growing on a
tree, or
shaken
down and gathered from
the
soil
; the
first
being a
trespass
, the
second
larceny.
Curia
advisari
vult.
The Captain
whispering
to lawyer Grab,
enquired what difference it made in the
punishment
, whether it was larceny or
trespass
?
He was
answered
, that in the one
case
it was hanging by the common law,
and in the other to pay the value of the
property. A very material difference
indeed
,
said
the Captain, to depend on
so
nice a
distinction
.
BOOK VI.
CHAP. I.
THE Captain had now
leisure
to
reflect
on the predicament in which
he left Teague; and thinking he might
have had what was
sufficient
to cure him
of his folly, or at
least
restrain
it, thought
of making a
visit
to the
house
of
employment
,
or
sending
to liberate the valet.
This thought running in his head, he
naturally
suggested
it to a gentleman with
whom he was, at this time, in
conversation
,
on indifferent
subjects
; the
gentleman
lodging at the
same
inn, or public
house
, and
seeming
to be a
person
of
considerable
shrewdness
and
discernment
, not
only of the affairs of men in general, but
of the
special
spirit
and character of
these
times.
Said the gentleman; The folly of your
man has certainly been very great, to
suppose
,
that he could be qualified to
sustain
the
profession
of an advocate, and to
practise
law: For, though in this, as in
most
other
professions
, the race is not always
to the
swift
, nor the battle to the
strong
;
but the people that
sheweth
favour;
that is,
take up an opinion of abilities, where
there are none; yet your
servant
, having
so
little, even of the
semblance
of
qualification
,
it would be counting too much on
the
circumstance
, to
promise
great
success
in his
case
. His
prospect
of advancement
would be much more certain in the
political
career. You
seem
, by your account,
to have
discouraged
him in taking a feat in
the
legislature
; and would not
wish
now
to contradict
yourself
: yet why not
indulge
him in taking a place in the
executive
of
some
government. As far as I
see
,
with that ambition which is natural to him,
you will find him but of little
use
, as a
waiter; and you may as well let him do
something
for
himself
, as not. If
appointed
in the department of finance, he can
use
clerks; and, in a very
short
time, he
may learn to write his name,
so
as to give
his
signature
to any paper; and this, with
the help of clerks to do the accountant
business
,
would be
sufficient
: At
least
, there
have been
those
in
these
departments, who
have been approved, and yet could do
little
more. Should he even become a
governor
;
furnished
with a
secretary
, he can
be at no
loss
to
compose
his
messages
, or
other communications, to individuals, or
public bodies.
But what I would
propose
, and will
suit
him
best
, will be to go into the
general
government; and, under this, the
diplomatic line will be eligible. He might
be appointed
consul
to the port of Cork
or Dublin; or the Barbary States; or
other
places: Or he might go as
ambassador
to the grand Mogul; or envoy
extraordinary
to the king of England; or
other princes or potentates in Europe.
If you
should
think of favouring him in
this career, it will be
necessary
for him to
appear at the levee of the
president
, that
he may be introduced with a certain
gradual
etiquette of advancement.
What!
said
the Captain; introduce a
ragged bog-trotter to the
president
of the
United States!
Not ragged,
said
the gentleman; you
can have a pair of breeches made for him;
and put
shoes
upon his feet: a
sword
will
be
necessary
; and
some
other articles of
equipment. And when you bring this
into view with his making his fortune,
you will not
consider
it as advancing much
for a
person
whom you
wish
to
serve
.
The Captain began to think there was
weight in the
observations
of this
gentleman
;
and that it might be proper to let
the bog-trotter have a chance of doing
what he could: Accordingly, he wrote a
note to the keeper of the
house
of
employment
,
to liberate him for the
present
.
The
state
of politics at this time, and
the
prospect
of Teague's advancement, we
shall
leave to the Third Volume of this
work.
POSTSCRIPT.
IT is well for men in office, that my pen has
taken this turn; and that I employ
myself
in
writing
harmless
nonsense
, rather than
strictures
on
their conduct In the
case
of the famous Gordon,
who, with Trenchard, was an author of what were
stiled
Cato's Letters, it is well known that the
shrewd
minister
of that day, Walpole, dreading the effects
of
these
writings,
wisely
laid a plan to free his
administration
from them; by affecting to admire the
stile
; and
saying
, that it were a pity
so
noble a
genius
were not employed in giving a
sample
of good
language, where there would be no
occasion
to
invent
,
but merely to clothe ideas. For this
reason
,
he would
consider
it as a great
happiness
, could he
be induced to
translate
some
work of merit; and
give it in the beautiful garb of his
expression
. By
this
address
, and the addition of a
pension
, the
author
was induced to undertake the
translation
of
Tacitus.
Now, what government, with great art, got
Gordon to do, I have done of my own accord; that
is, to
amuse
myself
in
abstract
composition
;
regarding
words only, and letting men of place alone.
Nevertheless
, as the
sale
of
these
is not certain; and
if I
should
find it an
expense
, rather than a profit, to
proceed in the work, I may quit it, and fall foul of
the public
measures
,
those
who
discharge
the
public
trust
, at the
present
time, may not be altogether
safe
. It were, therefore,
wise
policy in
such
, to
assist
the
sale
as much as
possible
; and it might not
be
amiss
, in the
first
instance
, to buy up, each of
them, a number of copies I do not know that I
have any thing to
say
of the
president
of the United
States; or that I would
say
it, if I had;
nevertheless
,
it might not be
amiss
for him, on the principle
of
preservation
, and, agreeably to that
universal
prudence he has ever
shewn
, to take a few;
perhaps
50 might
suffice
. The
secretary
of the
treasury
,
and the
secretary
at war, might take, between
them, about 500. As to the
secretary
of
state
, he
is
such
a
skin
-dried
philosopher
, that an author would
make as little out of him, as a fly would out of a
weather-beaten bone; and
so
, it is of little
consequence
to him, whether he buys one at all; for I
believe I
shall
not trouble my head about him. As
to the
Congress
that have
sat
since
the adoption of
the federal
constitution
, they need not put
themselves
to the expence, individually or collectively,
of
purchasing
one pamphlet; as I am determined
not to be bought off by them; but in a work which I
shall
by and by
publish
, will
canvass
, freely, the
respective
demerit of their votes. I have not yet
written any of this work; but I have it all in my
mind; and if I had a ready
amanuensis
, to take it
down, could give a volume in a
short
time.
The whole gradation of officers and place-men,
under government, are a good deal in my power.
Not that I would
descend
to attack
them;
but I
might affect the
system
by which they are
supported
.
A pretty liberal
purchase
, therefore, on their
part, might be money not ill laid out.
The men that are upon the government of
Pennsylvania
,
would find their account, in making it
worth my while to let my fingers run in this way,
a while longer.
Peream ne
scribam
;
I
must
write;
and if I
should
break out upon them, I know not
where I might end.

INTRODUCTION.
Proceeding
with my object; the
giving an example of a perfect
stile
in
writing
,
I come now to the third volume of
the work. I well know, that it will not
all at once, and by all
persons
, be thought
to be the model of a perfect
stile
, for it is
only the perfectly
instructed
, and
delicately
discerning
that can
discover
its beauties:
and perhaps none will be more apt to
pass
them by than the learned of the academies,
and the
most
versed
in grammar rules of
writing, for there is a
greeness
in the
judgment
of the
school
critics with
respect
to
what is
simple
and natural in
composition
.
To
illustrate
this by anology. Let a
dancing
master
pass
his judgment on the
movements of the
best
bred man in life;
and not finding in his
position
and attitudes,
an evident conformity to the
lessons
of the
salatory
art, he will conclude that he has
not been taught to move with propriety.
He does not know that it is this very
circumstance
that
constitutes
the excellence of
the movements of the
easy
and perfectly
genteelman; to wit, that when you
observe
him, it will never once come into
your mind that he thinks of his attitudes or
positions
in the
least
; but that every
movement
is
just
as it happens, and without any
intention on his part. Ars
est
celare artem.
To wit; It is the
secret
of good
taste
and
perfection in behavior to conceal that you
ever think of it at all. So it is the
most
perfect proof of a good
stile
, that when you
read the
composition
, you think of nothing
but the
sense
; and are never
struck
with
the idea that it is any
otherwise
expressed
than every body would
express
it.
That
stile
, is not good, where it appears
that you have not dared to
use
a word
without thinking a long time whether you
ought to
use
it; that, in the
disposition
of
words, you have carefully
studied
which
ought to go
first
and which
last
; and, that
your
sentence
has a cadence which could
not come by chance; but is the effect of
design
and art.
I acknowledge that no man will ever
write a good
stile
that has not well
studied
,
and
exercised
himself
in writing,
selecting
with a
most
perfect delicacy, in all
cases
;
the proper term; but he
must
go beyond
this, and be able to deceive the world, and
never let it come into their heads that he
hath
spent
a thought on the
subject
. But
it is not one in five hundred that is born
with that
sensibility
of nerve as to be able to
attain with the help of great
instruction
and
practice, a perfect judgment in the
use
of
words. It is for this
reason
that I am
ambitious
of the
praise
of writing well
so
far
as
respects
language. For it requires no
uncommon
structure
of nerves, or
organization
of the brain to produce good
sense
;
the
mass
of mankind is equal to this.
Language, as it is the peculiar gift,
so
it is the
highest
glory of our
species
; and
the
philologist
is to be
considered
as
cultivating
the
most
useful
and ornamental of
all arts.
Pursuing
therefore
solely
the
use
of words, I do not
descend
professedly
to
think of
sense
;
nevertheless
, if at any time
there
should
be found ideas that have
some
consistency
and meaning, they may
deserve
attention, as much as if it was the primary
object of my work to
express
them; for
it is not their fault if I
set
little
store
by
them, and think more of the
dress
that I
put upon them than I do of
themselves
.
I am happy to find that in the review of
this publication, given in Young's
magazine
,
my ideas of the merit of the
stile
, is
recognized, and fully
justified
. And as
my work may be well
supposed
, to have
a much more
extensive
circulation, and to
live longer than that
miscellaneous
performance
,
I have thought it not
amiss
, for
the honor of the critics to extract
some
part
of the
observations
which have been made
by them, and which are as follows:
The author of the work before us,
is H. H. Brackenridge, well known in
the literary world for his
treatise
on the
conomy of Rats, a
satirical
composition
,
in which under the veil of allegory, he
designates
the
measures
of the federal
government
;
as
also
for his
history
of Weazles,
in which the
same
strokes
are given to
those
at the helm of our affairs, in a different
fable
,
and narration. In the
present
work
which he entitles Modern Chivalry, he
disowns
the idea of any moral or
sentiment
whatsoever
, and
proposes
stile
only as the
object of the
composition
. And to this
object, in our opinion, he
scrupulously
adheres; for though on
some
occasions
,
there would
seem
to be a
semblance
of
idea, yet this we
must
attribute to the
imagination of the reader,
just
as in
looking
upon a
plaistered
wall, attentively for
a long time, you will conceive the
inequality
of the
surface
, or accidental
scratchings
,
to be the
shape
of birds and
beasts
, or
the letters of the alphabet. Yet as
reason
in this
case
will correct the fancy, and
bring to mind that there is really no
character
or image there, there being none
intended;
so
on a
perusal
of the work in
question
, looking a long time for
sense
,
you may at
last
conceive that you
observe
some
glimmerings of it, yet when you
recollect that you have it from the author
himself
that he means none, you will be
sensible
that it is nothing more than the
accidental
combination of words which has
given this picture to the mind.
Stile, then, which is his object,
must
also
be ours, in our view of the publication.
For, to give a
simile
; if a manufacturer
of cloth, or a taylor that forms it into
vestments
,
should
come forward, and
produce
each his work, to be
considered
merely
as to the manufacture, or making up,
without regard to the materials of the
woof and warp in the one
case
, or the
wearing in the other, it would be
absurd
to enquire of
these
when nothing was
proposed
to you
respecting
them, by the
artists
themselves
.
Confining
ourselves
therefore to the
stile
of this performance, we
observe
, that
it has what is the
first
characteristic
of
excellence
;
viz. Simplicity. This
consists
in the choice of the
plainest
and
most
familiar
words, and in the arrangement of
the words in their natural order. There
is a great difference between a vulgar term,
or
phrase
, and that which is common,
and comes
first
upon the tongue, in
easy
and familiar
conversation
. It is the
mistake
of this
distinction
which leads
some
writers to avoid the
phrase
that any one
would
use
, and
seek
out what is
uncommon
.
Hence there appears a variation in
the words they put upon paper, from
those
which they
themselves
would
use
in
conversation
. And why this? Ought not
language to be
precisely
the
same
whether
spoken
or written.
Perspicuity
is the natural
result
of
simplicity
,
and needs not to be laid down as a
different
characteristic
. For can there be
obscurity
in that
composition
where the
most
familiar word is
used
, and that word
put in its proper place. This brings to mind
the definition of
stile
by Swift;
proper
words in proper places. There can
be nothing more
easy
than the
composition
of our author, His writing
savours
of
the
skill
of an artificer who after many
years exercitation in his art, acquires a
power of
accomplishing
his work by a
habit
of the fingers, independent of any
application
of the mind. So that while in
the
stile
of others there is an appearance
of exertion, here there is what a
superficial
observer
would call
carelessness
,
but which the
sound
critic will
discover
to
be the
result
of a perfect
mastery
of all that
relates to language.
It is pretty generally believed that our
stile
has been
constantly
degenerating from
the time of queen Anne, in
whose
reign
flourished
those
immortal penmen, Swift,
Addison
, Arbuthnot,
Tillotson
,
Bolinbroke
.
&c. If the
stile
of Mr.
Brackenridge
is examined, and compared with
those
models, it will be found to be in the
same
pure,
simple
attic
taste
. We
shall
therefore not
hesitate
to recommend it as
a
restorer
of all that is correct and
beautiful
in writing. So far the reviewers.
I have
said
that I was happy to find that
these
have had the good
taste
to find out
what I
myself
had thought of the
composition
.
But as I
wish
at all times to let
the reader, into a knowledge of my real
sentiments
, I will
confess
that
these
are
merely words of
course
with me, and that
I was not happy to find my work
praised
in any
respect
;
because
I
wished
to have a
quarrel with the critics; and this not
because
I love war,
abstractedly
considered
;
but
because
in this
case
I
should
have had
an opportunity of
shewing
my polemic
talents. Nay, expecting an attack, I
had prepared a number of good thoughts
in my mind, to be
used
in my
contest
with
them. What is more I had actually
written
a copy of
verses
in the
Hudibrastic
rhyme and manner, for their
use
, in which
I
considered
them as
Muskitoes
, or flies
of
some
kind, that were
troublesome
to
men; and though the
occasion
fails, yet
there can be no impropriety in giving to
the public
those
strokes
of
satire
which lay
dormant in my mind. As
these
would
apply more particularly to an attack
upon
me; yet the
essay
being in general
terms, it may appear without a particular
circumstance
to call it forth; merely as a
specimen
of what I could do had there been
occasion
for it. And the
insertion
will
be
excuseable
, when it is
considered
how
painful it is to be
frustrated
in what we
propose
as our
pleasure
. I have known a
good man
wish
to have bad news true,
merely
because
he had related them: and
we may conceive a
saint
vexed at not
finding
a man dead, when he had
digested
a
funeral
sermon
in his mind, and was ready
to bury him. On this principle, therefore,
and in
spite
of the critics, I will have my
verses
published
: they are as follows:
THE critic
first
possess
'd the earth,
And by his rules gave authors birth.
You may be ancient: critic, hark!
Were you with Noah in the ark?
In what compartment were you
seen
?
'
Mongst
creatures clean or the unclean?
The critic,
sir
's, the natural father
Of every
snifling
,
snuffling
author;
And when you nod or
snore
or
sleep
,
We
shly
on
posteriors
creep,
And
rouse
you to a bright exertion,
Of all your faculties; you
whoreson
.
How can there be idea of beauties,
Unless
the critic genius
shew
't-us?
The angle of the
sight
obtuse
,
Can
see
no more than doth a
goose
,
Whilst
we with
microscopic
eye,
Examine as you would a fly,
See through the crevices of fancy,
As far as human
eyesight
can
see
,
Tell where there is or is not Grammar;
What
phraseology
wants hammer
Or file to make the
verse
run
smoother
,
Where
sound
is
harsh
, or term uncouther.
I grant you
see
defects and errors,
Of
those
in genius your
superiors
:
The
skin
however
smoothly
curried,
To a flea's eye is deep and
surrowed
.
His optics may perceive a wart,
That grows upon the
unseen
part,
But for the beauty of the frame,
It is above the ken of them
Thus critics tell that bard divine
Has a rough word in
such
a line,
Or that the
sacred
poem
scarce
Can bear the trot of
such
a
verse
,
That feeble author in
such
sentence
Has not the vis, the
spirit
intense
,
That
Pegasus
was lame when he rode,
Over this or that dull period:
They tell, but never felt the force,
Of genius in his rapid
course
.
What? did not Quintilian fully,
Develope all the
praise
of Tully?
And '
mongst
the Greeks, the great Longinus,
Who may be
justly
stil
'd his
highness
,
With critic judgment join the fire,
Of Heaven
itself
? who can go higher?
From your vile
accusation
whose
's
safe
?
Not even the elder
scaliger
Joseph
,
Who had a mind as big's a mountain,
Could all defects and beauties contain,
And
shew
'd that Homer was inferior,
And Virgil hit perfection nearer.
Have you the
assurance
sir
to
speak
,
Against
the Roman worth and Greek?
So much we hear I believe that no man's,
Tongue is
still
of Greeks and Romans;
For if
dispute
should
rise
past
curing,
Which way 'tis
best
to make our urine,
And each
should
argue
stiffly
his way,
All
must
give up, the Greeks
piss
'd this way.
But there in modern times is Bently,
Who
sung
of Richard Blackmore daint'ly.
I grant it, critic, there's a
thousand
;
The
list
beginning has nor knows end.
They
swarm
in millions from the flood
The Hebrew critics
first
drew blood;
And this is what is meant by Babel
Where all were critics that were able.
The Rabbin and the
Talmudist
,
Fought hand to hand and
fist
to
fist
,
About the pentateuch of
Moses
;
Their tales, the
wildest
stuff
, God knows is.
If there has been
some
Grecian critic,
Above the offspring of a
seed
-tic;
Yet where is one in modern days
Who can
deserve
that
share
of
praise
?
For metamorphos'd down to vermin,
Who can the various
shapes
determine.
And
small
and great are prone to
mischief
,
And every clan and
sect
has his chief.
They
swarm
like Caledonian
cluster
,
When the Mac Neils and Camrons
muster
;
Or as when
house
wife
spreads
her
sugar
,
With water mix'd, each
insect
bugar,
Relinquishes
pots, tubs and pails,
And for the booty
spreads
his
sails
.
Thus all the race of critics gather,
Around the
footsteps
of an author,
Bite through his overalls and
stocking
,
And biting
shins
, you know's no joking.
Who now a days fits down to write
Uninterrupted by a bite?
Unless
he takes good care and puts on,
A pair of leggins or has boots on.
They
say
of Reynard who loves
geese
,
That when
oppress
'd with
swarm
of fleas
He takes in's mouth a lock of wool,
And gradually retires to pool;
The fleas by
secret
instinct
led,
Fly from the tail and trunk to head,
With
speed
each mother's
son
of them goes
To
seek
the promontory of
nose
,
And when no more remains abaft,
Fox
shakes
his head and leaves the raft.
Who could find out by book or
sermon
,
An equal way t' allude the vermin,
Would merit a rich premium more,
Than vers'd in
philosophic
lore,
The member who
dissects
a glow-worm,
To
see
if 'tis a
beast
and no worm,
I
wish
some
virtuoso
won'd,
Who natural
history
understood
,
Dissect
a critic,
shew
his jaw teeth,
Whether they are quite
smooth
or
saw
-teeth,
Resembling
butterfly or
asp
,
Or
sharp
and pointed like a
wasp
;
And by the grinders edge determine,
Corn-eating or carnivrous vermin.
I'd give,
myself
, a golden medal,
To know if't has a brown or red tail,
And whether when it moves it goes on
An hundred feet or half a dozen;
But many
glasses
must
be ground out,
Before
these
mysteries
can be found out.
I leave it to
some
great Linus,
Who may by this be fam'd as he was.
The reviewers in Young's Magazine,
may
see
from hence how well it was for
them, though unfortunate for me, that
they have dealt in approbation
solely
.
The
prettiest
part of the
history
of any
author
,
is his war with the critics; and as
that prince's reign,
seems
uninteresting
where we are not
amused
with
sieges
and
battles,
so
the life of an author is dull and
monotonous where we hear of no
litigations
with a Bavius, or Mvius, a Dennis,
or a Colly Cibber.
It is true I have heard one
observation
made, viz. that though my
stile
is
excellent
of the kind; yet it is but of one kind,
and as Swift
said
of
himself
that he could
never
rise
to the
stile
of an oration or a
sermon
,
so
it would
seem
to be the
case
with me, that I am competent only to
that humble
species
of diction which
suits
the
dissertation
, but
rises
not to the
swell
of lofty oratory. It is true this is the
stile
I have
used
in the memoirs of the Captain;
because
it is the
stile
which
suits
simple
narrative
.
Nevertheless
, it is not with me
as it was with Swift; and in this
respect
,
I am his
superior
; for I can
rise
to the
swell
of the
highest
pipe of diction. And
to evince this, I will here produce an
oration
delivered by me about two years ago,
when I officiated in the capacity of
Chaplain
to the light infantry company of
Pittsburgh
.
I produce it only as a
sample
of
stile
; for as to other merit I will not
answer
for it; and if the learned
should
not
think it, in point of
sentiment
, worthy
of my fame, let it be my apology that
the company at
whose
call I was, and
military
discipline
being
strict
, I was
obliged
to obey at a
short
notice; the
company
I
say
, having given me but about two
hours warning, the
composition
bears the
marks of
haste
, not having that
condensation
of
sentiment
which deliberation gives
But of this let the public judge. I give it
as delivered.
The Oration.
What is the object for which a
soldier
justifiably
draws his
sword
? the protection
of
personal
and
social
right. This is
comprehended
under one word, LIBERTY.
By this we are to
understand
the
natural
liberty of man, independent of
government
;
or liberty in a
state
of
society
,
and government. The
first
being but ideal,
it is the
last
to which our thoughts are
directed
in the
use
of this word. What then
is liberty? It is the enjoying under
some
form of government, an equality of rights:
an equal right to
speak
, and an equal right
to act: where no one can or dare arrogate
a
superiority
of power or privilege.
Who would not
risk
a life for
such
a
blessing
?
Who would not immolate a hecatomb
of foes who
should
dare to invade it.
Csar; I admire thy talents, I
praise
thy
virtues; but in the face of nations, on the
height of the world, thou
daredst
to
usurp
a
superiority
over brave men. The
soul
of
Brutus, or of
Casius
could not brook it;
the
soul
of Cato or of
Casta
could not
brook it; every Roman felt the
insult
, and
approved the act, that took away thy life.
When
understood
and felt, what are
the charms of Liberty? When
possessed
and enjoyed, what are its effects:
greatness
of thought, and
greatness
of conduct.
Can the
vassal
think nobly? Can the
dependent
mind act boldly? No, there is
a lion in the way, and cowardice benumbs
the faculties.
Are mankind
sensible
of this? There
have been
those
who have borne honorable
testimony
of it. Shall I give you proofs?
I recur not to the academies to bring thence
the
sentiments
of
philosophic
men. I
depict
not
those
who have fought for liberty.
I give you the
sense
of a people who had
enjoyed it; who had
lost
it, and who had
been
restored
to it. Stating the
occasion
,
I
shall
give it in the words of Plutarch.
Philip and the Macedonians had
subdued
the Grecian
states
.
These
calling in the
Romans,
submitted
to their authority, and
received
garrisons
in all their cities.
Titus
Flaminius, who commanded the
Roman
forces, beat the Macedonians, and
reduced them to their own territories.
The Grecian
states
were
still
enslaved
, but
had changed their
masters
. The tolians
had thence taken
occasion
to
ask
them,
whether it were not matter of much
consolation
that, though their chains weighed
heavier, yet they were now neater and
better
polished
than formerly? Whether
Titus were not
deservedly
admired by
them as their benefactor who had
unshackled
the feet of Greece and tied her up by
her neck? Titus vexed hereat, made it his
request
to the
senate
, and at
last
prevailed
in it, that the
garrisons
in
these
cities
should
be
discharged
, that
so
the Grecians might
be no longer debtors to him, for a partial
but entire favor. The
Isthmian
games
were now renewed, and multitudes
sat
crowded in the theatre to
see
the
exercises
;
for Greece, who of late days not only
found
respite
from war, and was in full
possession
of peace, but entertained farther
hopes of regaining her liberty, made
holiday
for it. As
these
were celebrating,
silence
was commanded by
sound
of a
trumpet
,
and the cryer,
stepping
from
amidst
the
spectators
; made proclamation, that
Titus Quintus, the
proconsular
general
,
having
vanquished
king Philip and
the Macedonians,
restored
the Corinthians,
Locreans, Phoceans, Eubans, Achans,
Pthiotans, Magnitians,
Thessalians
, and
Perribans, to their own country, laws
and liberty; took off all
impositions
upon
them, and withdrew their
garrisons
thence. At the
first
, many heard not at
all, and others did not
distinctly
hear what
was
said
; but an odd kind of
bustle
and
stir
there was in the theatre,
some
wondering,
some
asking
,
some
crying out to the
cryer
,
Repeat that again, repeat that
again
.
When therefore
fresh
silence
was
made, the cryer
raising
his voice, his
speech
more
easily
reached the ears of the
company
.
The
shout
, which in that extacy of
joy they gave, was
so
incredibly great
that it was heard to
sea
. The people all
jumped upon their legs; there was no
farther
regard to the
diversions
they came for,
but all fell a leaping and dancing, and
hugging one another; and all
salute
Titus
with the title of
saviour
and defender of
Greece. The
strength
there is in voices,
and the many relations we have of the
wonderful effects of it, were
seen
verified
upon this
occasion
: For the crows that
were then accidentally flying over the
stage
, fell down dead upon the
shout
. For
the voices being numerous, and the
acclamations
violent, and the parts of the air
separated
from each other, they could no
longer give
support
to the birds, but let
them tumble;
unless
we
should
rather
imagine
these
crows to fall and die,
shot
through with the
noise
as with a dart.
Are the
present
inhabitants of that
country
sensible
of the value of liberty? They
are not. They are
enslaved
by the
Ottoman
power. Could they be
resuscitated
to a
sense
of this magic word; this extatic
sentiment
, what would be their
sensation
?
What the acclamation? The Theban, the
Achean country would hear it, all Attica
and Sparta would
resound
. The gean
and Corinthian
seas
would tremble.
Mount Olympus and Helicon would
triumph
.
The Gods on the one, and the
Muses
on the other, would celebrate the
festival
. But O! Poetic and
philosophie
country, where my mind ranges every
day; whence I draw my
best
thoughts;
where I
converse
with the
schools
of
wise
men, and
solace
myself
with the company
of heroes, thou art
lost
in
servitude
, and
great
must
be the revolution that can
extricate
thee thence.
Let me
console
myself
with the
prospect
of a nation, who, after more than a
thousand
ages of barbarian
conquest
and
feudal tyranny, have emerged to liberty.
It is France I have in view. O glorious
people? Liberty
descended
not to you.
But it is your
acquisition
. You have broke
the fetters that
enslave
you, and tyranny
has been put under foot. The
legislative
and judicial authority of your government
has been rendered independent of your
monarch, and the monarch reduced to a
simple
executive power. Shall the
sovereigns
of Europe
conspire
to
reinstate
him
in his
absolute
dominion? Shall they hope
to
subdue
a nation of brave men
contending
for liberty: Why do the heathen rage
and the people imagine vain things.
Sooner
shall
the clouds of the
atmosphere
restrain
the electric fluid, or the object
struck
upon
resist
the electric
shock
:
Sooner
shall
the height of hills and the weight
of mountains
repress
the caverned air, and
earthquakes
cease
to
burst
, than the
generous
flame of liberty in this enlightened
nation, can be
extinguished
and
lost
.
Noble nation, you do us too much
honor
in
saying
that you drew from us the
inspiration
of liberty. You drew it from
yourselves
. The
Montesquieus
, the
Rousseaus
,
the Voltaires, the Abbe Raynalls
of your country. We felt the like
spirit
;
and
resisted
the
British
power, and were
aided by you in the conflict. May you
enjoy that liberty which you
assisted
us to
possess
; may your example give that
liberty
to
surrounding
kingdoms which you
yourselves
enjoy. The mind
contemplating
the
subject
is enlarged, and travels from
state
to
state
, and from kingdom to
kingdom
hailing the voice of liberty. It is not
in the nature of things that
such
a
renovation
should
take place at once. But the
day may not be far
distant
when Spain and
Sardinia, Sweden and
Russia
, Germany
and Poland may hear the voice of liberty;
when Turky in Europe, and the
islands
of
the Archipelago may hear the
sound
, and
with an acclaim
surpassing
the
Isthmean
voice,
convulse
the heavens with the
impulse
.
Pursuing
the thought, what would be
the effect of
such
a
resurrection
of the
dead? The
expression
which I have
incidently
used
has given me a
simile
. It
would
resemble
the
resuscitation
of the
dead at the
last
day, when the inhabitants
of the earth recovering limbs and new
bodies
,
shall
raise
their voice. Great will
be their exultation; great their acclaim.
They will
shout
, and with an emulation
not
unpleasing
to the Almighty,
struggle
to
surpass
his yet
resounding
trump
itself
.
A copy of the preceding oration was
sent
by me to the Abbe Gochin, with
whom I have been in habits of intimacy
these
forty five years, and was by him
translated
into elegant French. It was
the
perusal
of this that brought me
acquainted
with the Jacobin clubs of that
kingdom, and induced Mr. Claviers to
make honorable mention of me at the bar
of the
assembly
.
The fact is, as may be
seen
from the
oration, I
possess
great
versatility
of
stile
,
and
vast
compass
of
sentiment
and
imagination
.
Nature intended me for a writer,
and it has always been my ambition. How
often have I
sighed
for the garrets of
London
;
where I have read
histories
,
manners
,
and anecdotes of Otway, Dryden,
and others, who have lived in the upper
stories
of buildings, writing paragraphs,
or
essays
in
prose
or
verse
. I have
lamented
my hard fate that I was not one of
these
. Was I to go to London, of which
I have
sometimes
thought, my
first
object
would be to
visit
the aerial
mansions
of
these
divine inhabitants. There is not a garret
where any of
these
have dwelt, or where
any of their
descendents
now dwells, that
I would not rummage to find papers,
scraps
and remains, of what may be
still
there. I
would at any rate
visit
most
of the
present
men who live by their wits, and
converse
with them, indulging that
pleasure
which
one takes in a
consimilarity
of genius.
It was on this principle that the
last
time I was in the city of Philadelphia, I
made enquiry of the
booksellers
, if there
did not begin to be in that city
some
of
these
garret people? I was told by
Dobson
of a certain M`Comas, a Scotchman,
that had come over about two years ago,
and was in that way: that he had written
paragraphs for the gazettes, and
occasionally
essays
for the magazines; and that
he lived in
such
an alley, I forget the
name of it, but that he had not
seen
him
for
several
weeks; and
supposed
he was
engaged in preparing
some
work for
publication
.
With the advantage of this hint,
setting
out, I found the alley, and by
description
,
the
house
; when knocking at
the door, an old woman opened it, to
whom
addressing
myself
, I enquired if Mr.
M`Comas, the author, did not live there?
He did live here,
said
the old lady, but
about two weeks ago he died, and left me
a quarter's rent unpaid, This is all a poor
woman gets by
lousy
authors and
such
truck that keep writing night and day,
and biting their nails, and mumbling to
themselves
, like witches or warlocks, that
I was frightened out of my wits many a
night, as he was tramping about in the
garret over my head and talking to
himself
.
I was
struck
with the undervaluing
manner
in which this old lady
spoke
of the
author
,
and being in
some
passion
, you old
jade
said
I, are you not
sensible
of the
honor
done you in having a genius for your
tenant; a man that with a
single
stroke
of
his pen could make you immortal. Ay
mortal,
said
she
, I am a poor enough
mortal to want my quarter's rent, with
his writings and fangles; I would rather
have a
person
that would
sit
still
, and hold
his tongue, and
sleep
in my
house
, than a
raving crazy brained creature like him,
that made more
noise
than the rats, and
was behind with his rent when he died,
not leaving a pair of breeches or an old
coat that would
sell
for the expence of
burying him. By this time I had a little
composed
my mind, and
suppressed
my
resentment
, and told her I would pay her
the quarter's rent for the honor of the
cloth, if
she
would give me leave to
visit
the
celestial
mansion
where the bard had
resided
. Accordingly,
depositing
the
rent, which was two
shillings
and
seven
pence, I was permitted to
ascend
or
rather
climb up a ladder with broad
steps
of
plank, to the habitation which was the
second
story
, for it was a low building,
with two apartments, the one on the
lower, and the other on the upper
flooring
.
The roof was low, and did not
permit
a tail man as I am, to
stand
upright
on my entrance. Looking about, by the
help of an opening in the weather-boarding
of the gable end, I
discovered
a few
papers, which I took to be
manuscripts
,
lying in a corner near a kind of
stool
, with
a board before it, nailed to the gable end,
on which he
used
to write, and making a
perquisite
of
these
in lieu of my two
shillings
and
seven
pence, I
descended
: nor
have I any
reason
to repent of my
visit
,
or the
sum
paid, for
amongst
these
I have
discovered
some
scraps
of great merit, and
particularly a
finished
poem, of
considerable
length, with the title of
Cincinnatus
,
in
Hudibrastic
verse
; a kind of rhyme
of which I am fond. I
shall
not,
therefore
,
scruple
here to
insert
the poem in
this introduction, as a
specimen
of what
this man's manner was.
I know it will immediately be
surmised
by
some
, that the whole is a fiction, and
that I
myself
have written this poem, and
that the
story
of an author, &c. is an
invention
to make it the more
interesting
to
the reader, and to keep
myself
out of
sight
and behind the curtain; in the
same
manner, as Cervantes, in his Don
Quixotte
,
pretends that his
history
is a
translation
from a
Moorish
writer, Cid Hamed,
if I forget not; and the author of the
Adventures
of a Guinea tells us of his tracing
the work to its
repository
in
manuscript
,
from a
single
sheet
which he found, if I
remember right, wrapt round a pound of
pepper which he had bought at the
shop
of
a grocer. At any rate, though I may
not be accurate, as to the
last
circumstance
,
yet I mean to
say
in general, that, as
many writers of fictitious works, in order
to give them an air of truth and reality;
or to delight the reader by relating
some
accidental manner of coming at what was
nearly
lost
, invent tales of finding
shreds
and
scraps
of
compositions
, and thence
tracing to the
source
; or that by taking
lodgings that had been before occupied by
some
poet or
philosopher
, they
discover
in an old trunk, or
elsewhere
, the
lucubrations
which they now offer to the
public
,
so
I may be
suspected
of adopting a
common mode of introducing what I
myself
have written; but the fact is as I
have
stated
. Indeed, upon the
least
reflection
,
no one would
suppose
that I
could be the author of the poem;
because
,
though it is but a playful
satire
, and
those
of the Cincinnati who are men of
sense
,
would only
smile
at the performance, yet
there are weak brethren, who might be
offended; and I
should
not
wish
to have
a
sword
run through my body, for all the
pleasure
that a little mirth gives. But as
to the man that is dead, nothing can hurt
him; and therefore there can be no
danger
in
publishing
what he wrote.
The
scheme
of the poem
seems
to be,
that of a member of the Cincinnati Society
with the badge at his
breast
coming into a
village, and the people of different
descriptions
falling in with him
occasionally
, and
altercating with him
respecting
the
demerits
of the
institution
, and the propriety of
the emblem which he wore. The
introduction
is as follows.
CINCINNATUS.
A Poem.
What
time the States had
settled
peace
With
adversaries
over
seas
,
And troops
disbanded
, it
seem
'd good,
To
institute
a brotherhood,
Among the chieftains of the war,
Of Cincinnati character,
Who now laid by their arms and came,
To
seek
an agricultural fame---
On territory they had
sav
'd;
For as together they had brav'd,
The toils of
service
,
wish
'd a tie,
At
least
upon the memory,
Of that
companionship
; hence 'twas,
The
institution
came to
pass
,
Of a
society
and badge.
At
first
it did provoke the rage,
Of
several
of the citizens,
As being
savouring
of
designs
,
Of a nobility of title;
And chevaliering here a little;
And hence, when one of
these
in's gate,
Came to a village of the
state
,
With badge dependant at his
bosom
,
It
seem
'd a
singular
rosy
crozum,
And drew attention and
surmise
;
And every one that
seem
'd more
wise
,
Began
discussion
of th' affair.
A certain pedagogue was there,
Did
first
accost
, and
ask
'd the
rise
,
And the intendment of device,
And why he wore a turkey there,
Effigies of a bird of the air,
And other
such
interrogatories.
The Cincinnat who heard the queries,
Explain'd the
history
of the club,
And effigy upon the bob;
Vidilicet, that having fought,
And put the
adversar
's to trot,
Retir'd from war, like Cincinnatus,
And were about to plant potatoes;
But
first
in memory of their warfare,
And individuals did
most
care for,
Had
set
up club and wore a badge.
And what bird have you in the cage,
Quoth pedagogue? is it a
goose
,
That you have
chosen
for your
use
?
Or a wild turkey or a
swan
?
This hurt the Cincinnati man----
Quoth he, I will not
say
you mean,
T' affront, and throw out with
design
,
This
sarcasm
on the badge we wear;
For 'tis an eagle of the air,
And emblematical of power,
As having dominion of the lower,
The fowls of the
stack
-yard and the grove;
And hence become the bird of Jove,
And is device upon the badge,
Which you and other fools with rage,
Decry and vilify and
abuse
,
As being without
sense
or
use
;
Because
your ignorance is
such
,
You cannot comprehend it much,
The meaning of the hieroglyphic,
Or motto that is
scientific
,
Devis'd by
scholars
that were good,
And authors of
similitude
.
Quoth pedagogue, I own I
saw
It had a bird's tail and a claw;
But never did
so
far encroach,
To look
distinctly
on the broach
Whether a grey
goose
or a drake,
That gives
himself
i' th'
roost
a
shake
,
But what
resemblance
is there here,
To him of Roman character;
Who wore no brochet at his button;
Or a remarkable
escutcheon
;
But when he quit the war and battle;
Return'd t' his harrow and draft cattle,
Without a
goose
-
resembling
bauble;
Or other bird or
beast
, could gabble,
A word of Latin or of Greek.
But what the
phrase
it
seems
to
speak
?
Relinquit omnia,
servare
Rempublicam; by the lord Harry,
The Roman had not much to leave,
And would have laugh'd
himself
in's
sleeve
,
T' have had
these
words applied to him.
And you that are of modern time,
Were in the
same
predicament,
Before were to the warfare
sent
;
So that the point is not in this,
From whence eulogium takes its
rise
,
The having left a
steer
or two,
Or an old
horse
with which did plow;
But your returning to your place,
When armies had been
sent
to
grass
;
So that 'twere better you had made it,
Nunc victor ad aratrum redit:
Or
some
such
phraseology
,
Designating
the eulogy,
Which really did belong to
such
,
As not ambitious over much,
Return'd from victory and war,
To till their ground, and take the care,
Of
stock
upon their farms; but wore,
No other
ensign
than before,
With barbarous Latin
such
as this,
Assum
'd for their
hypothesis
.
Quoth Cincinnat, a great Quintilian,
You are, and have read books a million;
Can give a Latin word to teach us,
Which way the Romans pull'd up breeches;
Or how tobacco quid in cheek,
Was turn'd by the enlighten'd Greek;
You cough and grunt by
syntax
rules
Drawn from the
prosody
of
schools
;
But though I know not Cincinnatus,
Or other Roman that begat us,
The club nam'd after him is good
And I could
shew
it if I would;
But
easier
to
dissolve
the knot
By
slitting
nose
or cutting throat;
Than talking about book or
classic
,
And reading till it makes the eyes ach;
For that my
business
is; this, yours;
Which
sophistry
, a hanger cures.
So
say
no more about the matter.
Meantime with ignorance and ill-nature,
There was a certain clergyman,
That took upon him to explain,
The meaning of the badge and
use
,
By reading
history
of the Jews;
Conceiv'd was an idolater,
That from the
eastern
climes came there
With native
sparrow
at his
breast
;
Or what
else
bird it was
express
'd;
Egyptian ibis or a
stork
,
That did among the
sedges
lurk,
In face of dictate that was given,
By decalogue that came from heaven,
Inhibiting the
worshiping
,
Of graven bird or
beast
or thing;
Or
otherwise
a great magician,
He was, and dangerous on the
occasion
;
For had a trinket of his own,
And abracadrabra writ thereon,
With
some
infernal
spell
or force,
Above a common
Christian
's powers.
The Cincinnat enrag'd to hear
Attack upon his character,
Addressed
himself
to the populace,
Were then
assembled
at the place.
Quoth he, though no great orator
Experience being more in war,
Yet
sense
of injury and wrong,
May
loosen
word-
strings
of my tongue;
Enable me to tell my tale
In way, perhaps, acceptable;
Especially
as candour hears,
As is evinc'd by your drop'd ears.
For well aware that public lies,
Insinuation
and
surmise
,
Had got the
start
of me, I fear'd,
I would not be with candour heard.
But to begin----'tis gone abroad,
That I have image of
false
god,
Hung at my
breast
; the effigy
Of bird, or
beast
, or
fish
or fly;
Which idol grav'd in bit of gold,
Like the idolaters of old,
I
worship
, and put up a prayer,
Tho' but a wild fowl of the air.
The clergyman has given
rise
,
To this religious prejudice,
As natural to every mind,
To breed according to its kind;
But nothing more
dissimilar
,
Than that a
soldier
in the war,
Should
worship
God at all, or
beast
,
In effigy or
shape
express
'd;
For
seldom
worship
the true God,
Save when
some
danger comes the road;
Unless
the
swearing
by the Lord,
Or zounds or zucks, or
some
such
word,
May be accounted reverence,
Express
'd to the Omnipotence;
And therefore much
less
probable
T' adore the
visual
beak or bill
Of this
small
eaglet that I wear.
As to idolatry am clear;
For though know nothing more about,
Religions that are
set
on foot
Than a grey
goose
; yet catholic,
Let all men
worship
till they're
sick
;
Nor interfere with church or
psalm
,
But be plain
soldier
as I am.
You that
compose
my audience,
Are
persons
of
superior
sense
,
And can with others
set
that right
Misrepresented
by the wight,
And
save
my hard earn'd character,
And the good name I
wish
to bear.
There was a citizen
just
by,
Who
listened
to apology.
Quoth he it may not be the
shape
Of bird or
beast
at which you gape,
For
sake
of reverence or of prayer;
But to
distinguish
what you are;
The only
saviours
of the
cause
;
It being not the truth; whereas
Are many others that have fought,
And taken the
Hessians
by the throat,
And may
deserve
more
solid
praise
,
Than wearing that
small
thing of
brass
,
Unworthy even of you that
chuse
,
To have the
ensign
of the
goose
.
Is't not ridiculous that one,
Who in the
service
has been known,
As champion of a
sober
cause
,
Which with it
such
advantage draws
As to
secure
our liberty,
And place the thirteen
stripes
on high
In this
severe
and ruggid clime,
Should turn his thoughts to
such
a whim
As
savours
of a ruder age,
When every light-head wore a badge;
And is no trophy or a
spoil
The warrior earn'd, upon the
soil
,
But arbitrary honor made,
By
some
one of the brazier trade;
And is no
special
proof of worth;
There are
so
many to hold forth.
Pretension
to the
same
device;
For the peculiar honor lies,
In being
distinguish
'd in
desert
.
Are you the only that merit,
In revolution brought about?
Or are there not
amongst
the croud,
Some others that have
just
pretence,
If not with
sword
, at
least
with brains,
To
patriotism
in the
cause
?
If not with arms they have withjaws
In councils of the
several
states
,
Or by their writings in Gazettes,
Rebuff'd the
British
power and force
And militated with
discourse
;
And many who have
spoke
and wrote,
Have
also
on
occasion
fought.
And there are victims of the
cause
,
By operation of the laws;
In favor of the general good.
What think you of the multitude,
Reduc'd by fluctuating paper,
Estates
vanishing
like vapour,
And brought to beggary and
loss
:
For take the people in the
gross
,
And all have
suffer
'd more or
less
;
And
so
may claim by
services
,
At
least
a bit of lead or pewter,
As their
deservings
are minuter,
And
institute
a club or
so
,
For what they did
against
the foe,
In their particular grades and places;
So that the multitude
increases
,
To an infinity of badges;
The honorary rights and wages,
Of the whole bulk of citizens.
In this there was but little
sense
,
To which the Cincinnat replied,
As having more
reason
on his
side
.
Quoth he, it is a
small
affair,
If at the period of the war,
We
instituted
this our club,
To recreate us after rub,
And wear a badge which
some
arraign
As
visionary
toy, and vain;
But is not fancy that
supplies
,
One half of things which are our choice;
And all beyond the
dress
and food,
Is but imaginary good?
The cut, the colour of the garb
Distinguishing
the Jew from Ar'b;
And all kinds of appendages,
Of different tribes and nations
dress
Have their foundation in caprice;
Not from
necessity
take
rise
.
The
savages
that are untaught
Do wear their honors at the
snout
;
And nature
sanctions
the
pursuit
By giving feathers to the brute.
The badge we wear is not a charm
Of
Physical
or moral harm;
But forcibly doth operate,
And in the human mind create
A love of fame and dignity,
By having this before the eye;
As, in the
British
isle
, a
star
And Garter, is reward of war;
And the St, Louis
cross
in France,
In other places like advance:
It is a
small
thing if from toil,
Of
summers
sun
and winters
soil
,
Deficient in the
stipend
due,
We wear a thing
distinct
from you,
A trifling
signet
of our own,
Shall
scarcely
cost
us half a crown,
Is there a law
against
the
usage
,
Proscribing
it as a
surplussage
;
So that a writ of capias corpus
Can have the virtue to
disturb
us,
If there is neither rule of nature,
Or
jurisprudence
that can deter,
Why not
just
let the things go on,
In the
same
channel 'tis begun?
For though not great the excellence,
Yet have there not been men of
sense
Among the Romans and the Greeks,
That wore
such
things about their necks?
A bull or button at the
breast
;
Or
elsewhere
, that has well
express
'd,
The
signal
honor they had won,
By keeping
adversaries
down;
Or
saving
citizen at
least
;
And yet the thing not made a
jest
,
By
persons
that have talk'd like you?
Quoth citizen, it may be true;
And
also
in the modern days,
There have been found out many ways,
To tickle fancies of the fools.
There
scarcely
is a king but gulls,
His courtiers with appendages,
(At
least
when he is
moneyless
)
Of title, or
some
silly
badge
With which they dance like birds in cage,
Proud of a feather that is red,
Or blue,
because
they take't in head,
It does them honor with the prince;
But here we have a little
sense
,
In
these
United States, and hate,
Such
phantasy
of a wrong pate;
And
wish
t' have merit of our own,
And not a mark to make it known,
Hung up like
sign
at tavern door,
Or barber's pole your
nose
before,
Evincing what there is within,
You could not other ways divine.
Besides
why do you quote the Greeks,
Or Romans that had like dogs tricks?
There is a difference in the
case
;
For there, the people's
suffrages
,
Bestow
'd the honor that was worn;
But here it would not
serve
your turn,
But you
yourselves
assum
'd device.
Quoth Cincinnat, 'tis all damn'd lies;
We took it up, 'tis true, but yet,
It may be
said
the gift of the
state
,
Because
the honor was our right,
And by
deserving
we came by 't.
Be that as't may the thing is
safe
,
And well befitting to the brave;
Quite innocent in name and nature;
Nor works a harm to
single
creature,
Is neither error, nor a
sin
,
T' offend a layman or divine.
At this the clergyman
spoke
out,
Who
still
was
standing
in the croud.
Quoth he, have
said
, and
say
it again
The thing is
heathenish
and vain,
And wearer an idolater,
Of whom there is
just
cause
to fear,
Being
some
false
prophet come to light
As is laid down in
sacred
writ,
That fell deceivers would
arise
,
In latter times to blind our eyes,
And draw us from the truth we hold;
For as to that
same
bit of gold,
What
use
?
unless
simbolical
,
Of
something
bad and magical,
With rhyme that is engrav'd thereon?
If the mythology was known,
It might be found it was that gog,---
And magog that has lain incog,
So long in the
apocalypse
;
And now emerging from
eclipse
,
Has
risen
in
such
shape
to men.
The Cincinnat to him again:
Quoth he, it ill becomes a
priest
,
To travel from his
sphere
, and
jest
,
About this trinket that I wear;
Against
it roaring like a bear,
Who
should
be
reasoning
with the jew,
Wherever he can find a clue;
Or with the infidel, about,
The devil's horns and cloven foot.
Is this the knowledge that you gather,
From every old and half dead father,
As
Chrystostom
or Poly-carp,
Who on a different
string
did harp;
From you, about our
institutions
,
Instead
of prayers and
absolutions
,
And teaching from the
catechism
,
The origin of faith and
schism
:
Which is unnatural and
absurd
,
Deserves
to be
chastis
'd and cur'd?
For have you not an ample
scope
;
Or as we
say
, enough of rope,
To vent your rage and crudities,
Against
the errors that
arise
,
Of fools that are
propense
to evil,
And lay the fault upon the devil,
As if he were a Jack o' lantern,
In every whole and corner
sauntering
,
Who never yet was out of hell,
Or knew a
single
syllable
,
About the matter laid t' his charge,
In pulpit oratory at large?
I'
st
not enough to
split
your text:
(Till every hearer's heart is vex'd)
In forks and branches multiple,
And
firstlies
, and
so
-forths at ill,
With heads and horns of Daniel's ram,
That in the prophet's
vision
came;
Or bring a
sermon
out of what
Has
scarce
the
semblance
of a thought,
By
twisting
, turning, proper
phrase
;
Or cloathing
pristine
nakedness
,
With commentaries of the brain,
Which no man
else
could find therein?
And have you not interminable,
Career to run as
fast
as able,
Through all the
systems
of the faith,
And variations that it hath,
Drawn from theology of
schools
,
Or
self
-born of the preachers
skulls
,
And built upon the
abstract
base
;
Which was originally much
less
:
For
so
extensive
is the flood,
Of knowledge that is bad or good,
A man may
souse
therein and
toss
,
Just
as in ocean would a
goose
,
And find no
shore
or bottom out
Of doctrines that are
set
on foot?
Why then
necessity
to
stretch
,
Your legs upon us at a fetch,
As if you had not room at home
To canter on your hypodrome,
But
must
inveigh
against
what is
But a mere
symbol
and device,
And has no moral turpitude;
Or meaning that is bad or good,
Save
just
to
shew
the club we're of?
Quoth preacher, it is well enough
To put that face upon the matter,
To keep the world from knowing better,
Lest
it
should
do your club a damage.
But is it not an molten image
Which the commandment hath forbidden?
Quoth Cincinnat, are
so
priest
-ridden
That common
sense
has little place.
It may be molten, to
use
phrase
,
But what of that, if not the
use
Is a new god to introduce,
And
worship
semblance
of a
beast
,
Or bird that is upon the
crest
?
It cannot give offence to
Moses
,
Or hurt the decalogu's-
proboscis
,
Or you that are
conservators
,
Of all that in religion
stirs
.
So that it is
unnecessary
,
To make our club your
adversary
By thus
misconstruing
the badge,
By inuendoes that engage
The rabble to have prejudice.
Quoth clergyman the matter lies
Just
here; the pagan deities,
False gods in Egypt or
elsewhere
Did under
some
such
shape
appear;
And even we read
amongst
the Jews
They fell
sometimes
to this
abuse
;
But chiefly
worship
'd calves and
stocks
;
For which were given them
sore
rebukes.
But
paganism
worship
'd fowls,
Eagles and pigeons and vile owls,
Which you would imitate by this
A
sample
of idolatries, ---
And whoredom people did commit,
And
sins
of the
flesh
in holy writ;
And hence were
banish
'd from the earth
Which gave the
several
nations birth.
Of Canaanites and after them,
The
Philistines
that err'd the
same
;
The Romans, Greeks, and other pagans,
That had their
astharoths
, and dagons
And
worship
'd bulls, and goats and heifers;
And were your oracle believers;
Whichbrought the
curse
of God upon them:
And hence it is that there is no man,
Who
sees
affection that you have
For that which workmen did engrave,
But fears a judgment for the
sin
,
And
wickedness
that is there in;
So that I preach and pray and
fast
---
Quoth Cincinat, not much of the
last
;
At
least
may
spare
it, and take food,
As prayers can do but little good;
And all your exhortation, is
A
rhapsode
of
absurdities
,
To make the
simple
people
stare
,
About this wild fowl of the air.
But as you
seem
to be a fool,
The
best
way is to crack your
skull
And let in light to give you
sense
And make your
soul
like other mens;
Removing this
enthusiasm
,
That turns your brain to
Jewishism
.
With that he drew as if to
strike
;
But one among the people, quick,
Who was a great
philosoper
,
Though yet had made but little
stir
,
Put by the blow, and thus
bespoke
;
Quoth he, your hot-born rage revoke,
Nor draw your
sword
upon the cloth,
Because
you are a little wroth;
And without
reason
or
just
cause
,
what has been thrown out; whereas,
It is a general allegation,
And turns upon the whole
profession
Of club, which has
so
broad a
base
It
easily
bears it, in this
case
,
And is not
personal
alone,
To you on whom the thing is thrown;
And when a number are to bear
The ignominy of the affair,
It is as nothing to the whole.
Have you Don Quixotte in your
skull
,
And yet not recollect the
speech
,
He made t' a town within his reach,
Which had conceiv'd offence,
because
His Sancho braying like an
ass
;
At which he was not any
slouch
;
Did
seem
to
say
they were
just
such
?
He tells them that no words can
strike
Or hurt a body politic,
Because
the offence has no
just
base
Of individual in the
case
.
Are not the learn'd
professions
known
To be
just
string
to harp upon?
We
say
that lawyers are all rogues,
And preacher, that he but humbugs;
And of
physician
, that he kills;
More than he cures, with his damn'd pills,
And yet we have not on our backs,
The whole of
these
like pedlars packs;
For the
physician
, lawyer,
priest
,
I aughs at the matter, as a
jest
.
Why, then enrag'd, at any one,
For obloquy, that he has thrown,
Just
for a theme of his
discourse
,
To
raise
a laugh among the boors'
Do they who write your
worst
of
satires
,
And ironies and all
such
matters,
Possess
a temper
worse
than others,
Drawn from the nature of their mothers;
Or
just
to
shew
their wit, at times,
They
scratch
out paragraphs and rhymes;
Attack the elergy, or the bar;
Or with hypocrates make war;
Or
chuse
a country, or a town
To be the
subject
of lampoon;
Who laugh and read the ridicule;
And only but a natural fool,
Would take in head to fight or fence;
Or '
gainst
the
slander
break his
shins
.
But where there may be
some
just
base
,
Of obloquy, in any
case
,
It more behooves to bear, as here,
Where though the matter may be clear,
You have a right to wear what badge,
You
choose
; yet, there are who alledge,
It is a
trespass
to break heads;
For though the man is pleas'd who reads,
The
history
of atchievment, yet,
Not him who feels the blow on's pate.
Unseasonable
chivalry,
Does not with modern times agree;
Where law takes place of ancient prow'
ss
,
puts a
stop
to the
abuse
,
Nor troubles knights to knock down cows;
Or giants that have broke a
house
;
So that it is
unnecessary
;
To eudgel any
adversary
,
Especially
a clergyman,
Who has his priviledge: again,----
Inglorious to make war with
such
,
Not having honor very much,
Of victory, when it is obtain'd.----
There was a corporal by, hot-brain'd;
Who had been in the war, and fought;
But no bald eagle, yet had got;
Or was a partner of the club,
Which military had
set
up;
And took it much
amiss
that
those
,
Who equally had fac'd the foes,
Unworthily, were left i' the lurch,
To
stand
the back
side
of the porch,
And though, were
also
at the
mustering
;
Yet had not at the
breast
, or
postern
,
A thing,
significant
of this----
For his part, he was wounded thrice,
While that
same
officer that
spoke
,
Had
scarcely
ever
seen
the
smoke
.
But
since
he was
so
hot to fight,
With clergyman, no man of might,
Had better turn to him a
soldier
,
Would make his blood a little colder;
And
ease
him of intemperate
passion
;
Because
the clergyman had
reason
,
And others, to find fault, and blame,
The Cincinnat that left no fame,
To th' common
soldier
, and the
sergeant
,
But of their own accord, took charge on't;
And wore this honor as their own,
Appropriate to
themselves
alone.
The Cincinnat, who heard this,
spoke
.
Quoth he, whether, in, or, out of
smoke
;
Or where, the bullets flew, or fell;
And men, and
muskets
, fought like hell;
No matter, to an officer,
Who only has a right to wear,
The emblem of the victory;
Because
there
must
be low and high;
And what is better born and bread,
'Tis
reasonable
should
be the head.
For what our nature makes the foot,
Doth, in the inferior
station
trot.
As, in this very body of ours,
We do not go, upon all fours;
So, it is
reasonable
, there
should
,
Be a
distinction
of the brood;
And
those
who have but little
sense
And lower quality of brains,
Should occupy a
sphere
beneath.
Is not the officer the head?
When we gave orders you obey'd,
So that 'tis proper you
possess
But the inferior grade and place;
And have no badge or
institution
.
The corporal felt his
passion
rushing
.---
Quoth he, have
just
as good a right,
As you, though thus you did come by't
To take to
ourselves
and wear a badge.
The Cincinnat felt greater rage.
Quoth he,
forsooth
,
because
you fought,
Where battle was a little hot,
You claim the privilege with us,
To be o' th'
inside
of the
house
,
To have
insignia
at your
breast
!
As well might an irrational
beast
,
The
horse
that draws artillery gun,
Or
soldier
had to ride upon,
Put in for heraldry,
because
,
Has
sometimes
been where dancer was.
What would you think to
see
a ribbon
Or badge, hung at his tail, or hipbone!
A
burlesque
on your appetite,
To have this matter made
so
light,
Which were a proper ridicule
When
such
a Teague O'Regan fool
As you, would claim the
establishment
.
The corporal's anger which was pent
Broke out.---It was not proof of
sense
,
Or other quality of brains,
Quoth he, that fabricated one,
An officer, and let alone,
The other, that was
just
as good;
But
Congress
, that was in the mood;
For, had a comrade, in my hut,
That would have made a perfect butt,
Of many that were officers,
Who had as little
sense
as bears---
And yet
forsooth
poor
soldier
dick,
May
wish
for honor, till he's
sick
,
And get no knob, or bit of ribbon,
Hung at his
bosom
, or his hipbone,
As many of the codheads have,
Who did not
shew
themselves
so
brave,
In any battle that was fought.
At this, the Cincinnat, red hot,
Drew out his hanger, to
shed
blood,
And hew down corporal, as he
stood
:
But thought it
best
, t'
accost
him
first
,
Before the matter came to th'
worst
.
As Homer, when he wages battle,
Between two of heroic cattle,
He has a parly, and a
speech
,
To know each other, which is which;
And, of what origin, they were;
And, how the devil, they came there:
Because
, whoknows, but they were
cousins
?
So
should
not cut each others weazons;
But, turn to other combatants:
And even in the time of giants,
And champions, throughout
christendom
,
Before they, hand to hand, did come,
And actual
clashing
of the
swords
,
'Twas not
unusual
to have words;
Though what was
usual
to be
said
,
Have not at
present
in my head:
But do, remember, very well,---
What from our Cincinnatus fell,
Quoth he, if,
so
preposterous
,
T' have
also
what they call a
goose
,
Is your ambition, why not take,
God's name, and hang it at your neck;
Or at your breech, or back, or
bosom
;
Or like a turkey-cock, at
nose
o' 'im?
Some wooden peg, or pewter noggin,
To wear it as you are a joging;
Or copper ball, or piece of metal
Inferior, for the common cattle;
With
something
on it like a bird
Or
sign
of poultry; whence infer'd,
That you have rob'd
hen-roosts
, you rogue
Or
stole
a duck or drake incog;
When rations were a little
scarce
,
This
seem
'd to make the thing a farce;
And a militia man
just
by,
Who
listen
'd t' him attentively,
Was angry, and began to frown,
To
see
the
soldier
so
run down.
Quoth he, though but a common rat,
I am, and you a Cincinnat.
Great captain, that have
spoke
so
loud,
In your haranguing to the croud;
And, though I know the
soldier
would
Much rather have a fowl for food,
And eat the wing or rib of a
goose
,
Than
smell
its picture at his
nose
;
Yet take a part in his defence,
Because
he
speaks
the better
sense
;
And undervaluing, you throughout
Hits me, and others in the croud,
Who being but militia
persons
,
Who in the war have made exertions
Yet have no right to wear the badge,
As indirectly you alledge,
By title and the club
assum
'd---
By this time common fame had drum'd
The like ideas every where,
Amongst
the people that were there,
With
such
exaggeration, as---
Is natural in the like
case
;
Videlicet, that the prognatus
Who then was there of Cincinnatus
Had ridicul'd all common people;
And blackguarded them like the devil,
Calling them all
scrubs
and bodkins,
And
habberdashers
, and
such
odd things:
How, that they ran away at York,
And left the regulars at the work;
And fled at Germantown and broke,
Whilst
they were
busy
in the
smoke
:
At other places turn'd about,
And
scarcely
ever
shew
'd their
snout
,
Where there was danger, or hot fire.
One of the people that was nigher,
Became the
spokesman
of the
rest
;
And rage now boiling in his
breast
;
Quoth he, no doubt, we are but goats
And
scarce
above the
beast
that trots,
Compar'd with you, in what was done,
And
services
, you
son
of a gun;
Tag-rag and bob-tail,
doubtless
, are
Compar'd with vet'ran officer:
Because
we have not at our
bosom
That thing of yours, a
rosy
crozum;
Are not
embellish
'd with a broach,
At head or neck, or
breast
, or crotch;
A Latin motto or an
ensign
,
Our toils, or
services
evincing;
Being but a vulgar
sort
of whigs,
That in the marches danc'd our jigs;
Nor help'd at Trenton to take
Hessians
;
Or fought like you, on other
occasions
;
Or at the Cowpens, made good battle;
And
so
are but a common cattle;
And you alone
sustain
'd the
cause
,
While we like bears at home
suck
'd paws;
And cannot now advance a claim,
To hieroglyphic of your
same
.
Quoth Cincinnat, the charge is
false
,
And of the nature of all tales,
Which contradict, and
shew
by proof,
Intrinsical
, what they are of.
What? an American, by birth,
Degrade the military worth,
And
lessen
the
applause
,
Of my compatriots, in the
cause
,
Of
those
who fought, in front, or flank,
In regular, or militia rank.
My
sentiments
are the
reverse
;
And never had in view t'
asperse
The
signal
honor you have won,
In order to advance my own.
These
words had
reason
, but his voice
Was wholly buried in the
noise
;
And as the clamour was, to beat
And
chastise
, this our Cincinnat,
His words could not
restrain
the mob,
Or check the violence of hubbub.
For where a multitude convenes
To carry on
some
hot
designs
,
They
must
do
something
, or
seem
slack
,
Of
skill
and courage, for the attack.
So
rushing
discompos
'd, the throng,
Brought violence, and blows along:
Here one uprais'd a ponderous
stone
;
Another got an old
horse
bone;
Elsewhere
, was
seen
, a block of wood,
Portending to the knight no good;
And all around, the face of war
Appear'd,
just
gathering, in the air.
Say,
shall
he wage an equal fight;
And wound whole ranks, and kill outright;
Like val'rous Hector, at the
siege
,
Of Troy,
compose
a perfect bridge,
Of bodies, upon which to tread,
And
swell
the rivers with the dead;
Or mow a whole battalion down,
Like Ajax,
son
of Telamon;
Construct
a rampart of the
slain
;
And
strew
with
carcases
the plain?
Or
shall
I bid him jump among,
The individuals of the throng;
Like Alexander when half crazy
He leapt the walls of Oxcydracy?
Or
shall
I render him expert
The various wiles of war t' exert;
And now give way, and now advance,
And
spit
a parcel on his lance?
Shall I
describe
a various fray,
And change the fortune of the day;
Now on the verge of a defeat;
And now, in turn, advantage get;
One while broke down, like very
stubble
;
Now
rise
, and give the foe more trouble?
What wounds
shall
specify
; what heart,
Oppress
with javelin or dart?
What names relate, and characters
Of
those
who rag'd this day like bears?
I wave the arduous
task
of this;
Because
narration would be lies;
For,
just
the naked truth
express
'd,
In
history
, is always
best
.
Hence
shall
relate what came to
pass
;
And how the
issue
really was;
Videlicet---but here again,
I feel the
rushing
epic vein,
To bring Minerva, from the clouds,
Down
sliding
through aerial
shrouds
;
To make her vet'ran champion
wise
,
And teach him that no honor lies
In waging battle, where the chance,
Of war, between the combatants,
Is
so
unequal, as this was;
For, had no head piece, made of
brass
;
Or iron, adamant, or wood;
And let him do the
best
he could;
Yet
still
, the number, and the weight,
Of blows, that
must
assail
the pate,
Would overpower his
best
defence,
And wound him, or knock out his brains.
'Twas no Minerva, or a God,
From dome
celestial
, or abode,
But, his own
reason
, play'd the part,
And put
discretion
in his heart.
For,
seeing
that the wild
misrule
,
Of mob, as raging to the full,
As pedlars at an
Ulster
fair,
With their
shilelahs
,
swung
in air,
Left him no hope of victory,
He thought the
best
way was to fly,
And without waiting for the blows,
He turn'd the corner of a
house
;
Escaping
from the rioters:
As when a morning
shadow
stirs
,
And hides
itself
behind a wood,
Before the
sun
that would
suck
blood,
Pursuing
, with his
rising
heat,
The thing that is not adequate,
To give him battle, and
withstand
The numerous beams he has at hand:
To overpower it on the plains,
And maul it, and knock out its brains.
Retir'd, and to a tavern got,
Where
such
disturbance
there was not;
Fatigu'd with what had
sung
and
said
,
Now on a
sofa
laid his head;
Because
he did not
wish
to trudge.
God Morpheus who does not begrudge
A dream, lent one to keep him quiet.
He
saw
a plain, and there
espied
,
The champions of the former period,
And airy
coursers
, on which they rode:
The cavalcade of ancient knight-hood?
A
shew
would do the very
sight
good;
Such, as the
monsters
, had knock'd down;
And dwarfs, and giants, overthrown;
And fiery dragons of the air;
And pale-fac'd virgins that were there;
Whom they had
rescued
from the
grasp
,
Of
ravishers
that did
enclasp
Their
snowy
bodies, in their arms;
And drank the
lustre
of their charms;
Or knights
themselves
, who had been freed,
From oaken durance, where were tree'd;
Or bound in rocks, where by a
spell
,
They had remained
invisible
,
The Cincinnat approach'd the throng,
Who beckon'd him to come along;
As recognizing his advance,
To be that of no common man's;
But one who came to join the
squad
,
By that
same
baublet that he had;
With
ensign
of the eagle's beak,
And motto in th' original Greek
Or Latin, knew not which it was:
For things had come to
such
a
pass
,
When
these
knights
flourish
'd, devil a one,
Had
such
a thing as learning known;
But all depended on their
slashing
,
For fame, and for diurnal ration;
And cut and carv'd their
sustenance
,
By force of vig'rous arm and lance.
The Cincinnat
address
'd as ought,
With
chosen
words and
select
thought.
Quoth he, my
seniors
, in the art,
Of chevalry's great
master
part;
You
see
me, of a junior breed;
A germ,
sprung
from the
self
same
seed
,
Of
predecessors
in romance,
And orders that did
flourish
once;
Profession
now degenerate,
Reduc'd to the very
lowest
state
;
For even the Cincinnati club
Which imitative is
set
up,
Is much traduce'd, and badge do wear
Is greatly undervalu'd here;
Particularly a pedagogue,
And clergyman that is in vogue,
And other cavilers,
just
now
I met with in a town came through;
Do lead
astray
the populace,
Who have no judgment in the
case
.
A
senior
from the
squad
step
'd forth,
Of a
superior
mein, and worth:
Quoth he, the more the degration,
Of chivalry, the more
occasion
,
For an exertion of the brain,
To kindle up the thing again;
And
doubtless
this
same
club of yours,
Has, as't were added boots and
spurs
,
To bring it to a trot once more
And
restorate
the days of yore.
And, if
discouragements
arise
,
In this the greater honor lies,
To overcome and
persevere
.
'Tis true, no dragons of the air,
Or fiery vultures do occur,
T' encounter with, and make a
stir
;
Or
damsels
ravish
'd in a wood;
Or giant to let out his blood:
Or an inchanter with his
spell
;
But yet there is the devil in hell
To pay with other villainies,
That in your modern days take
rise
Such as
false
notions of the right,
Which it behooves a valourous knight
T' arraign with free born thought and
speech
And tell the people which is which;
And no
less
courage is requir'd,
To
speak
the truth with which are fir'd;
Than to knock down a cow at
grass
,
Or
monster
that did come to
pass
.
Meantime a
message
had been
sent
By Charlemagne to call from tent,
By trumpeter, the
several
orders,
That lay upon th' enchanted borders,
Our hero look'd to
see
where was,
Old Cincinnatus in the
case
.
In vain, for, in
elysium
hous'd,
His mettle had not yet be rous'd;
But mixed, with the ignoble
shades
,
Did wander, idly in the glades;
And as in life, had been a plowman,
And wore no badge, or
dress
uncommon;
So now he troubles not his herd,
With
these
; but walks among the dead,
The Romans, or
obscurer
Greeks;
That wore no pendle at their necks.
At this the Cincinnat below,
Awaking as
some
one came through,
Saw nothing but the
standing
chairs,
And landlord coming down the
stairs
.
It would
seem
a little
strange
, what
could have induced this bard, to have made
choice of the preceding
subject
for his
poem
,
as not being an American; or at
least
,
long in America; and could not be much
interested
, one would think, in the
institution
of the Cincinnati Society. But it is
to be
observed
, that poets,
chuse
a
subject
,
and ridicule, or
praise
, not
because
they
care any thing about the matter; but
because
there may be
some
novelty or
originality
in the
subject
; and,
so
, what they
write, not altogether beaten and common.
It may be
also
just
to
observe
, that
foreigners
were more alarmed at the
institution
of the
society
than Americans, and
for this
reason
,
because
, they
saw
at home
the orders of nobility with
stars
, garters,
crosses
, &c. and felt the weight of
superior
rank, of which
these
were
sometimes
the badges: and transferring the idea to
the Cincinnati, they
considered
them in
the
same
point of view. Hence, it was,
that Mirabeau, in France, was led to
compose
a
treatise
against
the
institution
,
shewing
it to be, as he conceived,
unfavorable
to equality, and dangerous to the
liberty of
these
states
. Burke has been
the only American that has written,
professedly
,
on the tendency of this club:
but, as his name imports, I take it he
must
have been, originally, an
Irishman
;
and had conceived, in that country, an
unfavorable idea of titled
persons
, Sir
this, and Sir that one, &c. Probably
he has been of the Hearts of Oak, or
White Boys, who were of a levelling
principle, and
opposed
to all elevation
from the common
mass
.
For my part, I could never
see
that it
was of any
consequence
whether this
institution
existed
or not. For it
must
naturally
evaporate in a few years, the
spirit
of the times being wholly changed, from
what it was in the days of chivalry, and
not capable of
supporting
an
excrescene
which has no natural root, or foundation
in the opinion of the people.
The public may think what it will of
this little work of the unfortunate
Scotchman
;
but it appears to me, to have the
vivida vis, animi, in a very great degree;
and the
versification
, though
careless
, is
spirited
. The
brokenness
and disjointings
of the
verses
, one line running into, and
interlaced with another, carries it beyond
the monotous, though perhaps, more
musical
imitators of Butler:
amongst
whom,
Trumbull, of Connecticut,
easily
deserves
the
first
place; yet though in his
similies
,
and other excellencies of his
composition
,
he may
surpass
the Cincinnatus of M`
Comas
;
nevertheless
I
must
give the Scotch
bard the
praise
of greater variety in the
structure
of his
verses
. I
should
have been
glad to have
seen
him before his exit. I
have no doubt, that want of food, reducing
him to great
weakness
, together with pain of
mind from his
desolate
situation
, in a new
country, where there were but few in the
same
line with
himself
, with whom he
could
share
his joys, or communicate his
griefs, might
hasten
the
dissolution
of his
frame, prematurely. For, from what I
have collected of the mode of life and
private
history
, in general, of bards, and
those
who live by their wits, in old
countries
,
I can
easily
conceive the
pleasure
which they have with each other, when,
after a fortunate paragraph with one, or
a copy of
verses
with another, they
collect
a few
shillings
, and after
starving
several
days in the garrets while they had
been writing
these
, they now come
together
,
in an evening, to break their
fast
,
with a few tripes, and a little ale, to
exhilirate
their hearts.
Peace to the manes of M`Comas. He lies
buried in the Potter's-field; with a
single
stone
at his head, which I
myself
, though
I do not
wish
to
boast
of it, have put there,
with this
inscription
on it, and nothing
more, Sanders M`Comas. I hope there
will be no
mistake
, in future times,
reading
it M`Comus,
instead
of M`Comas:
because
, it might be thought, to be a
composition
of the name of the god of wit
among the Romans, which was Comus,
with the word Mac, put to it, which is a
Scoth adjective, which would puzzle
antiquarians
,
and be unintelligible: for the
fact is, he was a Scotchman, and his name
spelled
, as I have written it.
BOOK I.
CHAPTER I.
Having
got through this long
introduction
which may
resemble
that
species
of
pompion they call a
quashaw
,
whose
neck
is longer than the whole body; I
say
resemble
it, for it will not be altogether like
it, as it will not be more at
most
, than a
third of the work. However it has been
long enough, in all
conscience
. We
hasten
to the
sequel
of the adventures of the
Captain, and Teague his
servant
.
It will be recollected, that
pestered
with
the
preposterous
ambition of the
bog-trotter
;
the Captain, by the advice of a
gentleman, had
consented
to let him try
his luck of getting into
some
employment
under government.
However; after reflecting with
himself
,
a long time on the
subject
, he could not
help
expressing
to the gentleman, with
whom he was
still
in
conversation
, his
doubt of the
success
of
such
pretensions
.
Said he, after all, I do not
see
, how it
can be
reasonable
to
suppose
that he can
come to any great height, in
state
affairs:
He is totally illiterate and uncultivated.
As to that,
said
the gentleman, it is no
reason
at all. Do we not read in
history
of
persons
of the
lowest
education who
have
risen
to the
greatest
heights both in
the civil, and military line. Butcher's
sons
, keepers of pigs, feeders of
sheep
,
traffickers in
small
wares, have come to
be Cardinals, Popes, and
ministers
of
state
. That
impuse
of mind which he
discovers
to be
something
, indicates a
capacity
of being
so
. We
seldom
find in men,
a
strong
desire
of obtaining any thing
which depends on human power, who have
not been able to obtain it. Hence it has
been
said
, that let a man determine to be
Lord Mayor of London, and he may
arrive
at that dignity.
The Captain yielding to the
reasons
,
began to think, in what manner, it might
be proper, to give him an introduction,
and bring him forward; whether to
endeavor
to cultivate an acquaintance with
some
members of
Congress
, or the heads
of departments,
such
as the Secretary of
the
Treasury
, of State, at War, &c. or
to begin with
some
of the
subordinate
clerks, and
rise
gradually to the
knowledge
of the principals.
This,
said
the gentleman, would be
beginning at the wrong end.
These
people
must
naturally be jealous,
especially
of
such
as appear to have talents; not
knowing
but that in time they may come to
supercede
them. The
most
adviseable
way
is to attack the head at once:
Present
him
at the levee of the
President
, and make
him known to the Chief
Magistrate
. This
is going to the fountain, and not depending
on the
streams
, that divide among
themselves
;
and
sometimes
sink
in the earth,
and
disappear
.
Having been once
seen
at court, he will
acquire friends; and the
President
himself
,
can with more propriety take notice of
him.
But would it not be
necessary
,
said
the
Captain, before we undertake to
present
him at the levee of the
President
, that I
should
have him rubbed down, and
cloathed
a little better than he is at
present
.
Not at all,
said
the gentleman. It will
be
best
to
present
him, puris naturalibus,
just
as he is, without brogues; in his
over-alls
,
with that long coat and
slouched
hat,
which you have given him to wear. The
President
seeing
him as he is, will imagine
what he may be, when he comes to be
dressed
off in a
suitable
manner; and
imagination
always out-goes the reality.
Besides
;
unless
he had been
accustomed
for
some
time to good cloathing, he will
appear
aukward in it, and move with pain
to
himself
, and to others. Take a
country
girl that is neat enough in her
short
gown and petticoat, and put her in a fine
silk
with
stays
, and
she
will appear to
much
less
advantage. A clown in his
jacket and
trowsers
, is
respectable
; but
in a broadcloth coat, with
suitable
habiliments
,
he would move ridicule.
Governed by
these
observations
, the
Captain
proposed
to take Teague to the
levee the next evening.
CHAP. II.
Containing
Observations
.
The
gentleman who thus
advised
the Captain,
though a grave man, I do not think was
serious
. He
has been what we call a wag, and
wished
to
amuse
himself
with the extravagance of introducing Teague as a
candidate for public offices, and taking him to the Levee.
For the
Irishman
was certainly in no very decent
apparel
to appear at the court, even of a republic. The
jacket and
trowsers
, or overalls, as
some
call them,
that he had upon him, though of rough materials,
being a
coarse
tow linen, that had not had but one
boiling before it was made up, were not even whole;
what is more, not clean, not that he had voluntarily
on
some
great
occasion
, for a public or private
calamity
,
as was the manner of the Jews, rent his garments,
and put on
sackcloth
, and
strewed
ashes
on his head;
but what came to the
same
thing, by lying by the fire
side
at night, and
wrestling
in the day with the
hostler
,
and
servants
at the tavern, he was reduced to the
same
raggedness
and
ash
-powdered
state
.
Nevertheless
, though there might not have been
time to have
washed
his duds; yet a patch or two might
have been put upon his
vestments
; a
considerable
impression
having been made upon his flank, by a
sharp
point; and his rear being uncovered, a hand's-breadth
or more;
unless
indeed his breeches had been taken off
altogether, and he had come forward, a real
sans
culotte,
without any thing on his
backside
at all.
CHAP. III.
The Levee.
Having
waited with impatience
for the evening, the Captain, with the
candidate,
set
out for the levee.
Arriving
at the door, the Captain, entering
first
, and Teague
just
behind, he
addressed
the
President
: Said he, may it
please
your Excellency, here is a young man,
whom I take the liberty to introduce, as
a candidate for
state
employment. He
has been offered a
seat
in
Congress
. But
it appears to me that a place in the
executive
department would
suit
him better;
his name is Teague O'Regan; and has
been for
some
time a
servant
of mine, a
bog-trotter; but I believe I could now
spare
him if your Excellency has
occasion
to make
use
of him. The Attorney
General
,
and
several
others who were
present
,
were a good deal confounded at the
proposition
. A little lean Frenchman in
in the room, with a
sword
by his
side
,
was
astonished
; and
expressed
above an
hundred foutres to
himself
in the
compass
of a minute; I do not mean that he
spoke
out, but thought them to
himself
in a
short
space
. A
British
consul
present
,
who was a man of a
philosophic
turn of
mind, could not but reflect on the nature
of a republican government, and the
extraordinary
assurance
of the
lowest
class
to
pretend to offices.
The
President
, in the mean time,
contemplating
the object, made a
pause
. But
after
some
time recollecting
himself
, bowed
to the Captain, and to Teague, and
signified
that
doubtless
proper notice
should
be taken of the merits of the gentleman,
and
provision
made for him. This he
said
, bowing at the
same
time in a circular
manner, and turning round as if to
converse
with another
person
, to whom
attention
was in his turn, due. Teague in
the mean time advancing with his mouth
open, and both his arms
stretched
out, was
about to harrangue in his own dialect, as
plase
your honor, &c. But an aid of the
President
, or
some
one concerned in the
ceremonial of the
occasion
, touching the
Captain and Teague, and
conversing
with
them towards the door, gave them to
understand
,
that they might depart for the
present
; and that there was no manner
of
question
, but that his Excellency had
taken a note of the matter, and when any
appointment was about to take place, the
gentleman would be remembered.
CHAP. IV.
Containing Remarks &
Observations
.
I observe,
from
some
scraps
, in the public papers,
that the holding a levee by the
President
of the United
States, has given offence, to men of
severe
, and
extreme
republican ideas: For, as at the reformation from
the Roman Catholic
superstition
, the puritans, and
other thorough paced
reformists
, were offended with
the Church of England, for retaining
some
particulars
of the ancient ceremonies;
such
as the ring in marriage;
the
cross
in
baptism
; the
surplice
; kneeling at the
sacrament
; bowing at the name of
Jesus
, &c.
so
here;
the more rigid
revolutionists
from monarchy, object to
any
vestige
of its
customs
, and would lay
aside
totally
all
resemblance
of it.
On the other hand, it is
suggested
by
those
who
would
justify
, or, apologize for the holding a levee,
that it is in
itself
, no
substance
or
essential
of monarchy;
it is, at the
most
, but a
shadow
of it, and can do little
harm; that the
institution
was
suggested
by John
Adams, who having
just
returned from his
embassy
in
England, had no doubt good
reason
to
suppose
, that it
would be
pleasing
to the
English
people who were
accustomed
to
such
things; and to the king
especially
,
who, as far as we
understand
from Peter Pindar, is but a
thick-headed prince: It would be
pleasing
to him, to
reflect that though he had
lost
direct authority and
jurisdiction
in
these
states
, yet we were
still
disposed
to
touch, as it were, the hem of his garment, and adopt
some
of the trappings of royalty. In this
case
he could
with more propriety take notice of his brother George;
having a levee like another prince, than if he remained
but a bare republican, like a plucked fowl, without any
plumage to decorate his dignity. It is
also
said
, that it
was on this principle that Citizen Adams,
proposed
introducing
titles of nobility,
such
as, Duke and
Dutchess
,
Marquiss
and
Marchioness
, Count and
Countess
,
Baronet
and
Baroness
, &c. For, that complying in
these
small
matters with the
stile
of the
English
ranks, and
the genius of their government, it would produce and
preserve
a greater amity between the nations; and with
the court
especially
, and enable us to obtain greater
advantages in our treaties of commerce. Whatever
may have been the principle, I do not think the
proposition
bad. It could not be blameable; for Saint
Paul
himself
, in matters of religion, a thing much more
delicate in its nature, did not
hesitate
to
shave
the heads
of four young men, to
please
the Jews; and what was
worse
,
circumcised
the poor boy Timothy. What
then, if to humour a weak king, and a prejudiced people,
we had received the appellations of nobility?
Besides
;
the matter might have been
so
managed, as not to
injure
the
stamina
of our
constitution
; that is, not to
confer the titles; but let the people take them.
Carlisle
,
for
instance
, the
constable
in Philadelphia, might
have called
himself
Lord
Carlisle
, and
so
on.
The advocates for a levee,
say
, that it is
useful
in
order
to avoid the interruptions of
persons
calling on the
President
at his private hours, who have no other
business
than merely to be introduced and to
see
him; that
setting
a couple of hours
aside
, one day in the week, for the
purpose
of
satisfying
the
curiosity
of the people, is good
conomy; and is like throwing a barrel to a whale, in
order to
preserve
the
ship
. For, that, if this was not
indulged, little
else
could be done through the week,
than attending to the formality of receiving
visitants
.
To this it is
answered
that it
must
be impertient in any
one to call upon the
President
who has no
business
with
him, and if he has
business
, a levee is not the place to
settle
it; that the Roman Pretors, and Grecian
Archons
made out to
discharge
their offices, without this
expedient; that it is not
consistent
with the honor of
wise
and
modest
republicans to have it
supposed
, that
from idle, and light-headed
curiosity
, they would be
troublesome
to their chief
magistrate
; if any were
so
,
calling once, they could be
dismissed
in
such
a manner,
as to cure them of it; and the thing being once known
to be improper, the idea would pervade the
mass
of the
citizens, and the
most
uninstructed
, would be taught
not to
transgress
by
so
obvious an
intrusion
.
Besides
; the
curiosity
of
seeing
a man eminent in
office,
exists
chiefly with weak minds; for the more
solid
know, that it is not the figure of a great man that
has made him
such
; but a
series
of prudent and
successful
conduct. They are
sensible
that when they
see
the
most
distinguished
in arts, in letters, or in arms,
they will
see
a
person
that looks
just
like another man.
Is it worth while then,
say
the anti-lee-vites, to
consult
the
curiosity
of gaping haubucks, by obliging the chief
magistrate
of a government, to
shew
himself
to them
once a week, when he has
so
much real
business
on his
hands?
For my part, lying at the back of a mountain here;
the cool
west
wind blowing on me; I find
myself
little
heated with the difference of opinions on this
question
.
All I
shall
say
, is, that the ceremony of a levee would
not be agreeable to my mind; and if I
should
be
chosen
President
at any time, with which my friends flatter me,
I believe I
shall
not continue it,
unless
indeed, I
should
be allowed to
discharge
it by proxy. For I could not
myself
,
submit
to
stand
two hours, once a week, in a
circle, like a bear at a
stake
, to be
saluted
by all comers
and goers, and be obliged to
say
,
some
words of
course
,
to get clear of them. It is
possible
, this declaration
may affect my election, but
such
is my habit of candour,
that being on the
subject
, I could not help making it.
And I flatter
myself
, the
most
streneous
lee-vites, may
be reconciled to it, when I
propose
in its place to have
myself
taken off the more abundantly in portraits, and
to have innumerable medals
struck
representing
my
physiognomy
and features; and to
assist
this, I
shall
not
be backward, to have
discriptions
given of my
person
,
manners, and apparel, to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
strangers
.
This I hope will
suffice
.
CHAP. V.
From
the reception at the levee,
which the Captain thought favorable, he
began to entertain more confidence in the
advancement of Teague; and, under this
impression
, thought it now
adviseable
to
begin to take
some
pains with his bodily
appearance, and by the next interview,
produce him to the
best
advantage.
To conduct this by
system
, the
first
thing was to heave him down, as it were,
and
scrape
off his barnacles. This was
done by ordering into an apartment of
the kitchen, at the Indian Queen, a tub
of warm water. His overalls being
stript
off, and putting his feet and legs in this,
with hickory
ashes
, and a pint of
soft
soap
,
the
hostler
was occupied an hour or two,
in the
necessary
lotion and friction, until
the upper
skin
began to come off, and the
natural complexion of his
flesh
appear.
After this being
stript
altogether, his
whole body underwent the
same
operation
,
the Captain
standing
by, and ordering
his joints to be
stretched
, in the manner
of the Turks in their baths. After this, a
clean
shirt
was put on him, and the
usual
attire of a common man.
CHAP. VI.
The
next thing to be done towards
forming the bog-trotter, to
some
degree
of decency, was the teaching him
some
more
easy
movements of his
person
,
so
as
not to lift his feet
so
high, or make
such
long
strides
; as not being
necessary
, where
there were now no
sloughs
or ditches to
leap over, but carpets, or plain floors to
step
upon. This, with the
instructing
him,
in what manner, to turn his toes out, or
at
least
to keep his feet parallel in walking;
and turning round, to throw one heel
into the hollow of the other foot; at the
same
time, in what manner to bear his
arms and head; and to
preserve
, or,
incline
his body, in receiving or returning a
salutation
:
considering
by what means
this was
best
attainable, the Captain
thought to
himself
it might be
adviseable
,
in the
first
instance
, to employ a dancing
master
. For though the
lessons
of
such
a
teacher, might not give
ease
of behavior,
all at once, yet
these
might lay the
foundation
of it. For, no man ever came
from the hands of a dancing
master
with
a natural
ease
and flexibility of joint and
limb; yet being taught to move by rule at
first
, in the
course
of mixing with good
company, the wire edge of art would
wear off, and an
ease
of demeanor be
attained
.
For this
reason
he thought
proper
,
the next morning, to
send
for
Monsieur
Douperie, and to
address
him as
follows:
Monsieur
Douperie,
said
he, here is a
young man of
some
talents, as the world
supposes
, though I never could find them
in him; who, is in a fair way to be
introduced
into the political, and probably the
gay world: and as he is but
rustic
and
aukward
in his movements, I would
wish
to
have him
polished
; not that I expect he
can attain to great perfection in the
highest
species
of the dance,
such
as the minuet,
or the cotilion, or even the manuvres
of a country dance; but
simply
in the
position
of his feet, and to
step
and move
with propriety. For I do not think it
necessary
for a
statesman
, that he be a
proficient in the
saltatory
art; but,
simply
,
that he be able to bear
himself
upright
,
and to enter a room in an
easy
manner
,
and not take too long
strides
in
walking
across
the floor.
The Frenchman, eyeing Teague,
thought with
himself
, that he was but a
rough
subject
to work upon;
nevertheless
,
concealing his
sentiment
, as the manner
of the nation is polite and compliant, he
replied.
Monsieur
Capitaine,
said
he,
ver great
sensible
of de honneur, que vous
me faites, de attitude of
dourself
be
so
ver
natural, dat prove de high degree que vous
acquis in de art dat I
tashe
; and trow un
grand
lustre
, on de talents dat I
possede
.
Such was the compliment to the
Captain
himself
; though, by the bye, he was
but a plain man, and had never been taught
to dance.
Monsieur
Douperie continuing, turned
his attention now to the bog-trotter.
Dis
Monsieur
,
said
he, appear de
best
calcule of de vorld for de
danse
. Sa taille,
ver good, his limb promettent, ver much
en faveur of his talents futures. His
muscle
,
et
son
apparance
nerveuse
, confirm
me of his
strense
in de execution. His
eye, be ver good, pour fixet
son
visavis
,
his partner. Tout me promet un grand
expectation make
Monsieur
most
egal
myself
, in de art of de
danse
.
As to that,
said
the Captain, I would
not have you too
sanguine
. You do not
take into view the low
state
in which he
is; and what pains will be
necessary
before
you can bring him to that point where you
begin with others. So low is my opinion
of his
present
grade in point of manners,
that I had thought of putting him a while
under the care of a
person
skilled
in
breaking oxen, that he might be taught
to move by rule
in
some
rough way at
first
, before I would trouble you with
giving him the nicer precepts that
respect
the locomotive art.
Tres
plaisant
Capitaine, ver
plaisant
,
said
the dancing
master
, mais, j'me
promet
dat
Monsieur
make ver good
proficiance
,
in ver
short
time.
The Captain now thinking proper to
withdraw, left Teague to his
lessons
.
CHAP. VII.
Monsieur
Patrick,
said
Monsieur
Douperie, for
understanding
that he was
an
Irishman
, and thinking that all
Irishmen
were named Patrick, he gave him
this appellation:
Monsieur
Patrick,
said
he, il faut commencer, par les principes;
must
begin by de principle.
La primiere principe, de
first
lessong
est
placer les pieds; place de foot.
Voyez
;
dis foot, cy; comme cela, (
shewing
him how to place his foot) and ce luy, dat
foot, la; comme dis foot. (Shewing him
by his own foot how to place it)
Tournez
les pieds; open de foot, quoi! vous
ouvrez la bouche; vous open de mout, and
not de foot. Vous keep vos foot in de
same
position
, et vous baillez: you open
de mout. La
secon
principe, is to keep
de body droit; trait.
Must
sit
firm
sur
ses
membres, on de limb. Tenez votre
body as dis (
shewing
him in what manner
to keep his body)
assieyez
vous,
sur
vos
membres, comme ce la; dis way
Monsieur
Quoi! encore la bouche ouverte,
you open de mout again
Monsieur
Patrick.
Fermez la bouche,
shut
de mout.
I
stop
here to
observe
, that the opening
the mouth when an exertion of the mind
or body is required, is a habit very
common
with uninformed men, and not at all
peculiar to Teague: you will
observe
,
that men, who have not been long, or at
least
much in the habit of writing, when
they put pen to paper, open the
mouth, and protrude the tongue,
moving
it, as the pen turns to the right hand
or to the left; or draws the
stroke
long
or
short
; and, you will
see
a cordwainer
of good
skill
in his trade, from mere
habit
,
and not any defect of art, put out his
tongue, and move it, as if it could guide
his hand, when he is parcing nicely the
margin
of the
soal
of a
shoe
or boot: Having
made this
observation
in
justice
to the
bog-trotter
,
I return to my narration.
The Captain coming in at this point of
the
business
, made enquiry of
Monsieur
Douperie, what
success
he appeared to
have with his pupil. Bien tolerable,
Monsieur
Capitaine,
said
Monsieur
Douperie,
ver tolerable:
Monsieur
es d'une tres
bonne naturel; ver good
disposition
. A
la commencement il ne faut pas nous
flatter,
must
not flatter, wid de plus haut
degre, du
succes
; at de
first
of de
lessong
.
The Captain, not
so
much from the
words of the dancing
master
, as from his
countenance, and the tone of his voice,
saw
, that he was not
so
sanguine
with
regard to the proficiency of the
bog-trotter
as he had been at
first
:
Nevertheless
,
he was not
discouraged
in
suffering
Monsieur
Douperie to go on with his
lessons
;
because
he expected little more,
as has been
said
, than
some
improvement
of
step
and gait. Nor did he draw any
conclusion
unfavorable with
respect
to the
attainments of the bog-trotter in a
political
career;
because
he well that auk
wardness
of manner is not at all
inconsistent
with
the
highest
literary and political abilities;
and that
some
of the
greatest
geniusess
that
the world has produced have never been
able to attain the graces of behavior. The
poet Horace,
says
of Virgil; magnum
ingenium
sub
inculto corpore latet: and
the anecdote of Harley, earl of Oxford,
is well known; who, when Queen Anne
made him Lord
Treasurer
, his dancing
master
expressed
his
astonishment
, and
wondered what the Queen could
see
in
him; for he was the
greatest
dunce he
ever had at his
school
.
With
these
reflections withdrawing he
left the Frenchman to go on with his
lesson
.
La
troisieme
principe; de tird
lessong
,
said
Monsieur
Douperie, is to lift de foot;
you lift de foot,
Monsieur
Patrick, le pied
droit, de right foot furs; here Teague
raised
the left, O! mon dieu,
said
the
dancing
master
, le pied droit, et non pas
le guache; de right foot, and not de left.
Est
il
possible
, you no
disting
de right foot
from de left. Il faut lever le guache: a
la bonne heure, you lift de left foot.
Now,
Monsieur
Patrick; un pas avec
le pied guache; lift de left foot. Here
Teague lifted the
right
foot, thinking of
the former
lesson
, and willing to
please
the
dancing
master
by giving him that foot
which had
seemed
to be
so
much in
request
with him. O! mon dieu, par blieu,
said
Monsieur
Douperie,
est
il
possible
you no
disting
de right foot from de left?
It is
observable
of the French character
that while they
preserve
their temper,
they are all
complaisance
, and have the
sofest
words imaginable; but when they
break, it is all at once, and they
pass
to
the
opposite
extreme of
peevishness
. It is
not altogether owing to an irritability of
nerve but to that
system
of
politeness
which
they cultivate;
because
when the chord of
civility is immoderately
stretched
by a
concealment
of the feelings, when it is let
go, it flies the farther, and with the
quicker vibration, beyond the medium of
its
tension
.
O! mon dieu, par blieu,
said
the
Frenchman; and here he had
almost
said
foutre, which is one of the
worst
epithets
that is given, when great contempt is
about to be
expressed
.
However,
composing
his temper, and
resuming
his
instructions
; he continued;
now
Monsieur
Patrick,
said
he, le pied
droit, lift de right foot. Here Teague,
as he had not
pleased
his
instructor
by what
he had done
last
, viz. lifting the right foot,
now lifted the left, being always at
cross
purposes
, as it were, or
still
too far
forward
,
or too far back in his motions, to
correspond
with the directions given.
O! diable, diable,
said
the Frenchman,
raising
his voice, and
almost
vociferating;
quoi ferai je? il
est
impossible
d'
instruire
cet garcon: no
possible
make you
understand
fat I
say
, you do. Attendez vous,
Monsieur
Patrick; you look at me, and
lift de foot dat I lift; now I lift de right
foot; lift de right foot.
Teague
standing
opposite
the
master
,
and lifting that foot which was on the
same
side
with that of the
instructor
made
the
same
blunder as before, and lifted the
left foot.
Monsieur
Douperie enraged beyond all
bearing, ran out of the room, and left
his
scholar
for the
present
.
The day after this,
Monsieur
Douperie,
having
composed
his temper and attending,
the Captain made enquiry, as
usual
, of the
progress
of his pupil. The Frenchman
endeavoring to put the
best
face on the
matter,
said
some
things of
course
and
complimentary; but could not help
intimating
that it was une grand difficulty en
le commencement, in de beginning, to
make
Monsieur
disting
de difference of de
right foot, and de left.
As to that,
said
the Captain, it is a
national
incapacity; for which, as
also
for
their
propensity
to make what they call
bulls, it is difficult to account. There are
not a people more brave than the
aborigines
of Ireland, and are far from being
destitute
of talents, and yet there is a
certain liability to blunders, both in their
words and actions, that is
singular
.
Whether
it is that a mind
strong
and vigorous,
and of
extensive
range cannot attend to
small
things; or that a great flow and
hurry
of animal
spirits
, carries them too
fast
for reflection; or that there is a
transposition
of the brain,
so
that things
present
themselves
by contraries to the
imagination
;
I cannot tell: but the fact is
so
that
in their own country, as I have been told,
when they are taught to dance, which,
by the bye, is a hint which I forgot to
give you, they bind on the right and left
foot different badges, on the one, a
twisted
wisp
of
straw
, which they call a
sugan
and on the other a band of ozier
twisted
in like manner, which they call a
gad:
so
that when the word is given to
raise
the
one foot, and
depress
the other, it is
rise
upon
sugan
, and sink upon gad;
so
, that though the tiro may not all at
once, and on the word given, be able to
distinguish
the right foot from the left, he
may
easily
tell gad from
sugan
, as his eye
can
assist
his ear in this
case
; the object
being
simple
; whereas right and left
are relative terms, and that which is on
the right in one
position
, will be on the
left in the contrary.
Monsieur
Douperie was willing to avail
himself
of this hint, for
understanding
that
the bog-trotter was a candidate for
state
affairs, he was greatly anxious to have the
honor of giving him
some
proficiency.
Accordingly, though he did not procure
a
straw
sugan
, and an ozier gad, yet he
made
use
of what he thought might be
equivalent, viz. a red rag, and a blue;
so
that
instead
of bidding him move the
right foot or the left, he could
desire
him
to move the red rag or the blue.
Having tied
these
upon his ancles next
morning, he began his
lesson
. Now,
Monsieur
Patrick,
said
he, lift de foot
dat hab de red ribbon: Teague obeyed
with
exactness
and promptitude, and
raised
that foot. Now,
said
Monsieur
Douperie, de foot dat hab de blue
ribbon
.
Teague hit the direction, and
raised
the foot with the blue rag upon it.
A la bonne heure, vous y voila,
said
the dancing
master
; ver glad
Monsieur
Patrick you make
so
good proficiance; en
peu de tems, je vous
presentera
a l'
assemble
.
You
danse
ver well,
short
time.
La quatrieme principe,
said
the dancing
master
, de fort
lessong
est
former une pas,
to make de
step
. Voyez
Monsieur
Patrick
,
fat I do. You make
step
, ne
pas long
step
, mais van little
step
. The
Irishman
attempting to obey the directions
and to
step
, made a
stride
about an ell in
length with his arms
stretched
out, and
gaping at the
same
time. Foutre,
said
the dancing
master
; quoi! Vous baillez;
you ope de mout yet. Oh, diable!
diable
!
foutre! une bete! But
composing
himself
, he proceeded. Rangez vous a
quartier;
step
to de van
side
, comme ce
la;
shewing
in what manner to
step
out
with one foot at right angles to the other.
The
Irishman
, endeavoring to confine
his feet to rule, felt
himself
as much
embarrassed
as if chained by the heels; and
attempting to make the
step
as
requested
,
and making the
usual
exertions, with his
eyes
staring
, his arms
stretched
, and his
mouth open,
lost
the command of
himself
on the floor, and being thrown from the
line of gravity, was about to fall, when to
save
himself
, he made a catch at the
dancing
master
, and drew him down with him.
The dancing
master
supposing
that he
hand
understood
him, though in French,
when he
used
the term foutre, and called
him a
beast
, and
resenting
this, was about
to take vengeance, and having heard of
their mode of biting, gouging, &c. in
America, was much alarmed, and
disposed
to throw
himself
on the
generosity
of the
Irishman
, as not being able to contend
with him in
strength
: He exclaimed, O!
my lord Patrick,
excusez
moi, pardon,
Monsieur
Patrick, je demand pardon.
Pauvre diable que je
suis
. I be van poor
dible. Vous etes un honnete homme.
Ver good man. Un homme brave,
courageux
,
absolument
un homme brave,
gallant, tres brave, O! je
suis
un
malheureux
,
I be van poor dible. Je
demand
pardon, my lord Patrick.
These
were the exclamations of the
Frenchman, though, at the
same
time,
he was
uppermost
, but entangled by the
bog-trotter, who having
still
a hold of
him, was endeavoring to
rise
; which the
other was
disposed
to prevent, thinking
it
adviseable
to retain the advantage he
possessed
, and to keep him down until he
could
appease
him by his entreaties, or
until help
should
arrive
so
continuing his
expostulation
, he exclaimed, O! my lord
Patrick, faites moi, grace. I give you
my money. J'ai beacoup d'argent. I
give you an order
sur
mon intendant de
cent Louis; one, two, tree hundred
guinea. I forgive de
compensation
of de
lessong
,
Teague, in the mean time, having
understood
that
chastisement
was
usually
given at
school
, for inattention or
flowness
in acquiring the elements, and not
understanding
broken French, conceived, that
the dancing
master
was
expressing
his
resentment
,
and about to inflict
punishment
;
and therefore endeavoured to
excuse
himself
by a
speech
on his part. God love
your
shoul
,
said
he, dont be after bateing
me,
because
I can't walk like a crippled
coose
,
just
at once. By Shaint Patrick,
dis is like
stoodying
law in de
workhouse
,
where de
first
ting is a good bateing;
God love your
shoul
, let me up, and i'l
step
as
strait
as a lame
shape
, or a dog
wid dis leg broke into de bargain.
By this time
struggling
, they were both
on their feet, the Frenchman,
still
calling
out, voulez vous me tuer; O! ma
femme
,
mes enfans,
spare
my life my lord
Patrick, and the bog-trotter beginning
to
curse
and
swear
, and to
raise
the
Irish
howl.
Being
disengaged
, the dancing
master
made his
escape
, and waiting on the
Captain
,
not
wishing
to be under the
necessity
of giving any more
lessons
, gave him to
understand
that
Monsieur
had made ver
good proficiance, en ver
short
time; that
he was capable to
present
himself
in public
wid all de
success
possible
; that it was not
necessary
to give him any more
lessons
.
The Captain did not
suppose
that the
Irishman
could have made
such
advances
as the
politeness
of the Frenchman would
lead him to believe, but he concluded he
might have acquired what would be
sufficient
as a foundation for his obtaining
some
decency, though not elegance in his manner
and deportment. Paying, therefore,
Monsieur
Douperie the
sum
he
demanded
,
and thanking him for the pains he had
taken, the Frenchman withdrew.
CHAP. VIII.
Having
bestowed
some
pains to
cultivate the
personal
movements of the
bog-trotter, it now remained to
endeavor
to improve his manners. This the
Captain undertook,
himself
, and though
he had not read
Chesterfield
, yet he had
some
common ideas of decency, and
delicacy
in habits, and behaviour. On this
point,
addressing
his pupil, he began.
Teague,
said
he, you have now got,
in literal terms your rough coat off; that
is, you have
some
better
dress
, than what
you
used
to wear; you have
also
had
some
lessons
, in what manner, to
stand
, or
move your feet, as there may be
occasion
;
it now remains to
instruct
you with regard
to habits of delicacy, in
some
matters.
You
must
be careful to keep your hands
and face clean; pair your nails, and let
no black be under them.
Wash
the
inside
of your mouth, and
brush
your teeth;
keep a handkerchief, and wipe your
nose
with this, not with your bare hand; when
you cough,
spit
out, even
should
there be
nothing to
spit
,
lest
the imagination of
another, may
suppose
that there is; you
must
not belch, or break wind from your
mouth, or from any other part. By the
bye Teague, I have my fears of you in
this
last
particular, for you know you
have not been always careful in trotting
with me to
observe
a delicacy in this
respect
;
and, it would be the devil in hell, if
in a company of ladies, an
indiscretion
of
this kind
should
escape
you.
In the next place you will be careful to
avoid
scratching
your head, or your
backside
,
or putting your hand in the
waistband
of your breeches, or turning your
back to the fire, and pulling up your coat
behind, which is the way of the vulgar.
Put but a
small
quid of tobacco in your
mouth, not
swell
the cheeks as if you had
robbed a weaver of a ball of yarn, and put
it there. Do not
spit
on a floor, but in
the fire, or in your handkerchief if you
must
spit
. In eating,
sit
close
to the
table
,
do not put your
nose
too near the
plate; put but a little in your mouth at
once; do not
speak
while your mouth is
full; or while you chew. If any one
speaks
to you in this predicament, bow;
as much as to
say
I will
answer
you
presently
:
drink healths
sparingly
, if at all.
Do not blow in your cup to cool your tea.
Keep your infirmities to
yourself
, and do
not complain of
costiveness
, or
laxativeness
;
of pains in the bowels, &c. A
gentleman
should
have no complaints,
unless
to his
physician
, of any thing, but the
gout, or a fever, or the like. Give no
information of a bad
digestion
; or food,
being heavy, or light to your
stomach
; of
your agreeing with this or that food, but
its not agreeing with you, as the vulgar
say
; that is, as we
shall
understand
you,
it gives you the belly-ach. Take care not
to value
yourself
, on your eating, as that
will
shew
a
gross
mind; or on your
drinking
much, as that is but a low ambition.
Sing no bawdy
songs
;
especially
amongst
ladies;
such
as Brian O'Linn, and
Arthur O'Bradley; or that about
Tristram
Shandy O. For though
these
were
suitable
enough to your former
station
,
and
such
as you have been
accustomed
to
sing
among the girls at the taverns,
yet they will not
pass
amongst
more
refined
company. You
must
get
some
more
fashionable
airs,
such
as the Bird, or
Guardian Angels, or the like.
Even at clubs,
amongst
gentlemen, I
would recommend it to you to avoid lewd
and indecent
songs
;
especially
if they are
of the
gross
and
disgusting
kind. As you
are an
Irishman
, a
verse
or two of Lango
Lee might be
excuseable
, perhaps. It is
true, that in the higher ranks, among
both males and females, the double
entendre
is
sometimes
used
; but
unless
it is with
great delicacy, and relieved by
singular
wit, it is not
admissible
.
There are rules of good manners which
you are to
observe
. Such as when you
walk with any
person
, let them walk
next the wall; if you are about to enter
a room, with another, let him enter
first
.
or if about to
sit
down, give way to
another
who is
also
about to
sit
down.
Decline
the higher
seat
. You
must
not talk
too much;
especially
about
yourself
;
boasting
, as I have heard you do
sometimes
,
of jumping and trotting, and how
you could
wrestler
, and the like. I am
afraid. Teague, that after all the pains
I am taking with you, you will
spoil
the
broth, by
some
out-breakings, of your
old tricks, and habits in
some
way or
other. However,
since
I have
suffered
myself
to be
persuaded
to try the matter,
let it go on, we
shall
see
the
issue
of it.
These
are the outlines of
some
of the hints
upon manners, given by the Captain.
BOOK II.
CHAP. I.
The Beer
House
.
Having
thus far cultivated the
bog-trotter
by
washing
, and currying his
person
,
forming his movements; refining
his manners, and give him
some
ideas of
delicacy of behavior, it now remained to
indoctrinate him in a knowledge of
politics
:
and for this
purpose
, as he could
not read the Gazettes, or other
publications
,
it became
necessary
, to give him the
opportunity of oral information, on
political
questions
: and as attending the
debates
of
Congress
, and hearing only, in
the galleries, would not put it in his power
to join
occasionally
in the debates, and
exercise
himself
in
speaking
; the
attending
private clubs, or
spending
evenings,
occasionally
, at beer
houses
,
seemed
the
more eligible means to be adopted.
Accordingly
an evening, after this, the
Captain
taking him to a beer
house
, and
occupying
a bench, called for a mug of
ale, and bade Teague attend to the
conversations
that were going forward.
The redemption of what are called
certificates
was at that time the
subject
of
debate
.
It is well known to the readers of
the
present
day in America, but which
perhaps will not be
so
well
understood
when this work comes to be read an
hundred
years hence, that the United States,
having incurred debts during the war with
Great Britain, and being unable at that
time to
discharge
them, could only give,
certificates of the
respective
sums
due to
the
several
creditors;
these
they did give
to the
soldiers
of their army, to
those
from
whom they had
purchased
articles, or
who had rendered any
service
: The
prospect
not being immediate of the public
being
in a condition of taking up
these
, and
the
necessity
of many of the holders
pressing
,
they had transferred their right in
the certificates for a fourth, fifth, or
sixth
of their nominal value; in
some
cases
, at
a much lower rate. The
question
was,
whether under
these
circumstances
, the
original holder
should
be bound by the
contract
,
and the transferree ought to take
the whole
sum
from the public.
It was
stated
on one
side
, that it was
the folly of the holder to make the
contract
.
There was no fraud or
imposition
in the
case
; what he did was with his eyes
open. There was no undue advantage on
the part of the
purchaser
, for he took no
more than the place of the holder; and
the bargain was fair and equal on both
sides
. The one had a
present
certainty
which he preferred: the other an
uncertainty
of a greater
sum
, of which he
chose
to run the
risk
. The
purchaser
who gave
credit to the bills of the
states
,
stood
in a
better point of view than the holder, who
distrusting
payment, had parted with
them.
On the other
side
it was contended,
that the certificates being only the evidence
of the debt, the receiving that was no
payment; that real
service
was rendered,
and real payment
should
be made;
that the
purchaser
discovered
a
distrust
of
the credit of the government as well as
the holder, in not giving the full value,
and therefore
stood
on no better ground;
that from the prevailing ideas under which
these
contracts were made, the holder did
conceive
himself
parting with
these
securities
at an under value, and the
purchaser
,
as obtaining them at that rate, but
neither
had an idea that the
loss
on the one
hand, or the advantage on the other,
could be
so
great as on the principle of the
provision
made for the
discharge
of the
public debt it had come to be; that for
these
and other
reasons
measures
ought to
have been adopted of a
discrimination
between
the original holders and the
transferrees
.
Teague had
listened
attentively, and,
contrary to the injunction of the Captain,
with his mouth open. He would
willingly
have taken a part in the debates, but
the Captain, thinking the
subject
too
abstruse
to begin with, did not
seem
to
approve
of it, and
shaking
his head,
repressed
the
disposition
of the bog-trotter.
The next topic of argument, was that
of the
assumption
of the
state
debts. In
order to
understand
this we
must
state
;
that, in carrying on the war
against
Great
Britain, contracts were made, and debts
incurred, on the faith of the confederated
states
, by their
representatives
in
Congress
,
and this was called the continental debt.
At the
same
time, contracts were made
and debts incurred, on the faith of
individual
states
, by their
representatives
in
the
state
legislature
, and this was called the
state
debt. This whole debt, continental
and
state
, had been thrown into one
mass
,
and the payment
assumed
by the
Congress
.
The policy of this
measure
was now
canvassed
.
On the one
side
, it was
contended
,
that as the whole debt, continental
or
state
, was payable by the United States,
each
state
paying the quota apportioned
by the
resolves
of the former
Congress
,
and having credit for what
state
debt
contracted on account of the war, was
over or beyond this quota, the
question
was no more than this, whether the ways
and means of
raising
money for the
discharge
of its proportion of the
state
debt,
should
remain with any
state
, as was
before
in the
case
of
furnishing
its quota;
or whether the United States,
assuming
the debt in the
first
instance
,
should
take
upon
themselves
to
discharge
the whole;
that it came to the
same
thing, as the debt
was payable by the whole, and the only
question
, was with whom it
should
lie to
devise
ways and means, to
discharge
it;
that the
system
of finance became more
simple
, when the United States,
assumed
the whole, and provided for the payment
by ways and means of their own at once;
that
it would contribute to the energy and
secure
the establishment of the federal
government
,
to have that government the
immediate debtor of the whole amount.
To this it was
answered
, that each
state
was a better judge of the ways and means,
within
itself
, for the
raising
money to
discharge
its debt; and while the United
States, now having command of the
imposts
should
necessarily
take upon them to
collect and provide for the
discharge
of
the continental debt, properly
so
called;
yet it might be left with each
state
as
before
,
to collect and pay over what was
called the
state
debt; receiving credit from
the United States, and having a right to
draw from thence, any overplus of that
proportion which by the
resolves
of the
former
Congress
they ought to pay of
the whole debt.
The Captain thinking this
subject
also
above the
comprehension
of the
Irishman
,
was not willing that he
should
speak
yet.
The next topic was that of the
incorportion
of the bank of the United States,
some
contending that no power was given
by the
constitution
to the general
government
to incorporate banks; others
asserting
that though not
expressly
, yet under
the article of paying debts, &c. and
making
laws
necessary
for that
purpose
, it
was by implication given.
The Captain thought this
also
above the
reach of Teague, and obliged him to be
silent
.
The next
subject
of argument was the
policy of the war carrying on
against
the
Indians. By
some
it was contended that
an Indian was a good creature,
simple
and
inoffensive
, like a young child; that you
might put your finger in his mouth, and
he would not bite; that by
speaking
softly
and kindly, and giving him victuals and
drink, and leggins, and breech-clouts, and
blankets, you might do what you
please
with him; that when you gave him
ammunition
and fire arms, he would go out
and kill turkies, and
shoot
down
squirrels
,
and bring you in a deer, now and then; that
there was no
such
thing as an Indian
stealing
a
horse
, or burning a
house
, or taking
a
scalp
,
unless
you had
first
stolen
his
horse
, or burnt his
house
, or made a
catch at his
scalp
; that when you made a
treaty with
these
people, they had
such
a
love of
justice
,
such
a
sense
of honor,
such
a perfect command of
themselves
, and
their young men, that, there was no
danger
of their departing from the treaty.
On the other hand it was advanced,
that, as a
savage
differed little from a
beast
of prey; a wolf, or a panther of the
woods; was rude; his
passions
violent,
attached to no farm; cultivating no art;
his only
amusement
, or
sense
of honour,
war; or hunting, the image of war;
his
sense
of
justice
, little; his
sense
of
honour
,
none at all; no government in his
state
of
society
; no
security
for
individual
or national engagements; that fear
pervading the
mass
, by reaching the
feelings
,
and
apprehensions
of each individual
was the only principle by which they
could be governed; that
instead
of
treaties
and giving goods, as heretofore, it
became us to retaliate by a heavy war
against
them, and to make known, by
feeling, our
superior
strength
.
Such were the arguments on each
side
of this
question
; when the Captain
looking
at Teague, and
observing
that he was
anxious to advance his opinion,
assenting
with a bow, or inclination of his head, he
seemed
to
signify
that he might
speak
.
But before we hear him, it will be
necessary
to
observe
, that during the
preceding
arguments, the company had
taken
notice of him, as he
sat
beside
the
Captain
with a mug of beer before them; and
had wondered in their own minds, who
he could be; for though he was a little
brushed
up by this time, as may be
supposed
,
having been at the levee, and taught
to dance, and received
lessons
of delicacy,
and what not;
nevertheless
, there was
still
an
uncoothness
in his appearance that
could not be all at once
shaken
off.
His form had yet not
lost
all her original
roughness
: nor appeared
less
than a paddy
dressed
; and the
excess
of
rusticity
removed
.
He therefore the more
easily
engaged attention, when
raising
his voice,
he
addressed
them as follows:
Plase
your honours,
said
he; I have
heard of
dese
Indians, when I was
trating
with the Captain my
master
. I came
acrass
one o' dem, who affer'd a hundred
dallars for my
scoolp
; he was going to a
traty here abouts. But my good
master
the Captain took my part, and didn't let
him take it aff; de vile
savages
! O! I
have heard of
dese
Indians;
plase
your
honours; they come out of de woods, and
stale
shape
, like de rabbers in Ireland, and
burn
houses
, and take
scoolps
; trate wid
dese
! I would trate wid dem, wid a good
shelelah
, or a tomahawk to break der
heads. Give dem goods! by Shaint
Patrick
,
I would give dem a good bullet
hole in deir faces; or
shoot
dem trough
de
backside
for deir pains. If I was in
Cangress
, and God love your
shouls
, I
wish
you would put me dere, I would
make a law to coot dem aff, every one o'
dem. O! if my uncle Phelim, and my
cousins
Dennis and Dermot, and my
brother
Murtock, and de oder boys was
here, we would
chase
dem, as you would
chase
one of deir own
shape
; and keep
dem aff de country, and
send
dem home
to eat paratoes. God love your
shouls
,
raise
a good party and go out upon dem,
and bring dem to de coort, and not let
dem be
staling
shape
, and taking
scoolps
from de poor people.
You tink to
plase
dem, by
spaking
good
words to dem. Spake a good cudgel
upon
der heads, and bid dem be
asy
dear
honies
,
and keep at deir homes, and plant
paratoes, and be hang'd in deir own
country
;
plase
your honours. Trate wid dem!
Trate wid de woolves or de bears, dat
roon troo de woods: I would trate wid a
good knock in deir troat, and be doon
wid dem.
From the manner in which he
spoke
,
of having been in danger of
losing
his
scalp
,
and the Captain
rescuing
him, it was
understood
that he had been in a campaign
against
the Indians, and his fervour was
excused
, and thought natural.
Those
particularly who were for
using
force
against
the
savages
, thought the
Irish
gentleman
had
spoken
very well.
Encouraged with this
success
, the
bog-trotter
was confirmed in his opinion, that
he was fit for any political appointment;
and the Captain
himself
, began to
entertain
better hopes of his advances than he
had yet done.
CHAP. II.
Though
I am not employed in political affairs; or,
meaning to make my book a
treatise
of finance; yet I
may be indulged in a few remarks on the preceding
subjects
.
I am far from being greatly confident that I am right;
nevertheless
I will acknowledge that in the
case
of the
certificates, I always found
myself
inclined to have made
a
discrimination
. It
seems
to me that even on the
principles
of the municipal law, it would have been
justifiable
.
Let us apply the chancery
decisions
to the
case
of the contract between the original holders, and the
transferrees. In a court of equity, a contract will be
set
aside
on the principle of,
1st
. Fraud.
2d. The
unconscionableness
of the bargain.
3d. The being
against
the public
interest
, and good
policy.
1st
. Fraud: And in this
case
, it is not
necessary
to
prove
express
fraud:
presumptive
is
sufficient
. This
court, meaning the court of chancery,
says
lord
chancellor
Hardwicke, will relieve
against
presumptive
fraud,
so
that equity goes farther than the rule of law; for
there fraud
must
be proved, and not
presumed
only.
1st
Atkins 352.
To apply this principle in our
case
. Is there not
presumption
of fraud, where the holder of a certificate
parts with it for a little more than the tenth of what is
really due upon it? But it is well known that actual
and
express
fraud, did in general
exist
in the traffic in
these
securities
, the
purchasers
, individually, or in
combination with others, decrying the credit of the
government
,
and depreciating as much as
possible
, the
value of the certificates.
But the
same
great chancellor, lays it down, that
To take an advantage of another man's
necessity
is
equally bad as taking advantage of his
weakness
, and
in
such
situation
, as incapable of making a right
use
of
his
reason
, as in the other. Fraud has been
constantly
presumed
, or inferred from
circumstances
, and
conditions
of parties;
weakness
and
necessity
on the one
side
,
and extortion and avarice, on the other;
and merely
from the
intrinsic
unconscionableness
of the bargain.
There
are hard
unconscionable
bargains, which have been
construed
fraudulent,
and there are
instances
, where
even the common law hath relieved for this
reason
expressly
.
1st
Atkins 352.
2d. But the bare
unconscionableness
of the bargain,
all idea of fraud out of the
question
, would be
sufficient
to
set
aside
the contract in a court of equity.
Sir John Strange, the
master
of the rolls in the court
of chancery lays it down; that there may be
cases
where this court will
interpose
to prevent improvident
persons
from ruining
themselves
,
before the expectancy
falls into
possession
,
though no
express
fraud or
imposition
appears.
1st
Atkins 346.
But let it be
supposed
that the contract was equal,
and
conscionable
at the time of making it; the one
taking
a
small
sum
certain, and the other receiving the
uncertainty
of a large
sun
.; yet has it not become
unconscionable
by the event? Did any
purchaser
ever expect
to be paid the whole nominal
sum
, in gold or
silver
?
The ideas of the time
must
be yet
fresh
in every man's
mind; and we well know that no man was
so
sanguine
as to expect this. It was
supposed
that
something
might
be done towards paying the
interest
at a future day, or
lands in the
western
country, might be obtained for
them. But whatever the
purchaser
might think, no
seller
did imagine that for one-third, or one-half of a
dollar, he was transferring twenty or twenty five
shillings
.
It was not in the contemplation of the parties
to
lose
so
much on the one
side
, or gain
so
much on the
other. It is an unexpected event that has put it in the
power of the public to do more in making a
provision
for the payment of the public debt, than could at that
time be
foreseen
. What is more; it is an event brought
about by the
joint efforts of the original holder and the
tranferree; I mean a new
constitution
of government,
under which the
legislature
of the
states
having the
command of all
resources
, was able to make a better
provision
for
these
debts. It is
unreasonable
, and
unconscionable
that the transferree
should
take all the
advantage
of this event? Let any man putting a
thousand
dollars in his pocket from the bank of the United States,
look at the war-worn
soldier
, or the widow and
fatherless
who has parted with them, and
say
if his
conscience
is not touched with a
sense
of the
unreasonable
gain.
If it is not, it ought to be. At any rate, on the
principle
of
unreasonableness
, a contract of
such
undue
advantage
,
would not be
sanctioned
by the law. The
3d. Ground is that of the public
interest
, and good
policy. Lord Hardwicke lays it down, that political
arguments, in the
fullest
sense
of the word, as they
concern the government of a nation
must
, and have
always
been of great weight in the
consideration
of this
court (the court of chancery) and though there may be
no dolus malus in the contract, as to other
persons
; yet,
if the
rest
of mankind are concerned, as well as the
parties
,
it may properly be
said
that it regards the public
utility.
1st
Atkins 352.
There can be nothing more hurtful to a people than
sudden
losses
, and
sudden
gains to individuals.
Happiness
depends on a gradual
accession
of attainment.
Perhaps
a
sudden
loss
inflicting with melancholy, is not
more hurtful, than
sudden
great gains, hurrying into
a
situation
for which the mind is not gradually qualified.
But
sudden
gains out of the way of common
industry
,
affect the
sensations
of others, who partake not; and
feel chagrin and
dissatisfaction
with their
state
in life.
Such gains
sap
the foundation of common
industry
.
For what man will be equally content to labour in his
vocation, and
pursue
the common means of a livelihood
when he
sees
his neighbour all at once, by
some
fortunate
cast
,
so
far before him in his
acquisitions
. It is
on this principle that our
legislatures
have prohibited
gaming, lotteries, &c. In the natural world there is
a gradation in all things. Animals grow to their
size
in a
course
of years; trees and plants, have their
progress
;
Jonah's ground might
spring
up in a night by a
miracle; but in general all the productions of nature
have a regular period of
increase
.
The attainments of men are made to depend
usually
upon their
industry
. As ye
sow
,
so
shall
ye reap. In
well regulated
societies
this conomy is imitated, and
where one
estate
comes by accident, five hundred are
acquired by common means. Such an
institution
of
things
constitutes
the health of any people.
On all or any of
these
grounds, therefore, fraud,
unconscionableness
,
or
sound
policy, a contract of the
nature
in
question
, would have been
set
aside
on a bill in
the chancery of England, and in our courts, the contract
would not be
established
against
the original holder of a
certificate: or on payment to the transferree, an action
would lie to the original holder, counting for money
had and received to his
use
, and demanding all above
the
sum
originally paid, and with legal
interest
from
the date.
But it will occur, that there were in
most
cases
a
number
of transferrees between the original holder, and
the then
possessor
. The impracticability of making
these
answerable
to the original holder, for their
respective
proportions of the undue gain, will put them out
of the
question
. The
case
would then have
stood
between
the original holder and the
last
transferree. Shall
he be
answerable
to the original holder for all the
intermediate
gains? No. But let him take no more than
the then
selling
price of the certificates. It became the
legislature
in the
first
instance
to have
ascertained
the
current value of the public
securities
, and to have made
provision
for the redemption of them in the hands of
the transferrees, at that value and no more; but in
the hands of the original holders, at the full
specie
value
;
and let the
sum
saved
from transferrees go to the
original holders
who had transferred. Was it
practicable
that
these
could be
ascertained
? Let the proof lie
on the original holders; and where it could not be
made, let the public be the gainers.
As to the
assumption
of the
state
debts, perhaps,
it would be
adviseable
for me to be as
silent
as the
bog-trotter; as it is
possible
, I may not have a perfect
knowledge of the
question
. But from the knowledge
I have on the
subject
, it has appeared to me I will not
say
an
unjust
,
but an
impolitic
measure
.
If more were
led to look to the general government, and to depend
upon it, as being the general debtor; yet with this it
took the odium of
imposing
duties to
discharge
the
whole. It would have been as well perhaps, to have
left the
states
themselves
, to enact
excise
laws, or to
devise
whatever other ways and means, they thought
proper while the
imposts
, which the United States
had now got in their collective capacity, would have
been
sufficient
to have
answered
the continental debt
where they were the immediate contractors. There
is that advantage in a public debt, that the fortunes of
many are made to depend on the
existence
of the
government
;
but as there, in the nature of things, can
be but few, in proportion to the whole, there will be
in that proportion, a greater number to be affected
with the payment, and to be
careless
of the
existence
of
the government, or to
wish
a
dissolution
of it. When
that debt, as in the
present
instance
, by the
necessiries
of the
distressed
, the
distrust
of the credulous, and
opportunities
of the knowing, has come to be in few hands;
after having
passed
from the
most
deserving
, at a
small
value
it
exists
with an odium upon it in the public mind,
which naturally transfers
itself
to all ways and means that
can be
devised
for the
discharge
of it. At the
same
time
that it is well to brace the government, and
secure
its
strength
, it is an object of equal moment to
preserve
it popular: affection, as well as power, are the bands
of authority.
As to the bank incorporation, I
shall
only
say
, that
the doctrine of
insering
powers by
implication,
is
extremely
dangerous, and may
easily
be carried to
overthrow
all the boundaries of any
constitution
. I think
it much the
most
adviseable
, when the
case
is doubtful,
to wait until the
same
authority by which the
constitution
is
established
,
shall
have declared its
sense
on the
subject
. For
otherwise
, except as to the
form
of a
government
,
independent of its
powers,
a
constitution
will
be of no
use
.
A
transgression
of the
constitution
is the breach at
which tyranny enters; and of all things it is the
most
difficult thing to
preserve
a
constitution
inviolate. The
Council of
Censors
in
Pennsylvania
, was a means, and
I think a good one. They did
themselves
honour in
the report they made with
respect
to the violation of
the
constitution
, though the
spirit
of party prevented
them from going far enough. Under the United States
there is but one means, and that is the
decision
of the
judiciary. The judges have done
themselves
honour in
a late
case
where they had the independence to declare
a law void which they
considered
as
unconstitutional
.
In the
case
of the bank, would not a writ of quo
warranto
lie. I can have no doubt of it; and, I may
be
mistaken
, but I can have no doubt but that
the judges would find
themselves
bound to declare the
act in
question
not within the powers granted to the
United States, and therefore void.
As to Indian treaties, having
occasionally
in this
work,
insinuated
my ideas, it may
seem
a repetition
to
say
any thing more on the
subject
. Indeed the
objection
may lie in general
against
the work, that
certain
subjects
,
such
as the
Philosophical
Society, Popular
Preaching, Indian Treaties, &c. have been too often
introduced. To this, I have to
answer
, that it has
been the
system
I
proposed
, not to
exhaust
a
subject
all
at once, but to touch it for the
present
, and introduce
it afterwards in a different point of view, where
such
things might be added, as would
otherwise
originally
have been brought in;
just
as, in order to
preserve
a
relish
for the
same
food, we do not dine upon it in
continuance
,
but having had veal to day, take pork
to-morrow
,
and the third day return to veal again.
Having certain ideas to inculcate, I bring them
forward
at various times, and in different
shapes
, with
front, flank, rear, corps de
reserve
, &c. As the human
mind, from defect of attention, or incapacity, cannot
be reached all at once, in the manner of the prophet,
imitating his zeal, and knowledge of the heart, I give
line upon line; precept upon precept; here a little,
and there a little. This will be my apology, for
touching the
subject
of Indian treaties again in this
volume.
On this
subject
I lay down
these
principles; that an
Indian is a man, and you may bind him by kind words
and good acts. But he is an ignorant, uninlightened
man, and when you
lose
the affections of his heart,
you have little hold upon his
reason
to recover it:
Respect
for you, in the
first
case
, is the ground of his
attachment; fear of you in the
last
,
must
be your
means to reclaim him. Hence it depends upon
circumstances
when a
treaty is expedient,
and when a
war is
necessary
.
Apply this to our
present
situation
with the Indians.
At the
conclusion
of the war with the
British
, we were
thought to be conquerors: though the
savages
were
kept in the dark with
respect
to the
stipulated
surrender
of the
posts
on the lakes, and the
cession
of the Indian
country by their allies, yet it had
transpired
among
them that we had been
successful
against
the great king;
hence a fear of us was
impressed
, and it was
expedient
to treat.
We did treat, and after
some
interval, as will
always
be the
case
, war, again took place. They have
have had the advantage. This is not, therefore,
the
crisis
to treat.
Amongst
ourselves
, do we not find, that if you
yield to the
imposition
of an ignorant man, he will
attribute
it to your want of
discernment
to
observe
it;
whereas, on your part, it was to avoid all contention
with a low
person
. If you are
insulted
by an ignorant
man, he will attribute it to your cowardice, that you do
not challenge him, whereas, it is an
unwillingness
to
have your name mentioned with his, as having had a
dispute
at all. If you attempt to negociate a contract
with an ignorant man, and
ask
him
just
what you ought
to
ask
, he
proposes
less
than he
otherwise
would have
done; and not until you convince him, that you are at
a world, in
these
matters, will you induce him to agree
to what is
reasonable
.
A
small
success
with an ignorant man,
against
an
adversary
,
will give him hopes, which the
occasion
does
not
justify
;
because
he does not comprehend the
principles
,
and
see
how much accident, or
causes
that may
not
exist
again, had to do in the
business
. It is
therefore
like
selling
a fowl in a rainy day, to attempt
negociating
with an ignorant man, when his imagination
is not corrected by an experience of facts
against
him.
It is on the principles of human nature, that I found
my ideas of managing the Indians.
I would deprecate a treaty at
present
,
because
it
could not be permanent. We are in a fair way, to
bring things to a
state
in which it might be
adviseable
to treat. Let the event be what it may, I am one of
those
who not only approve of the
present
war
against
the Indians, but
also
of the princ
i
ple on which it is
carried on, viz. by a body of regular and well
disciplined
troops. It is
suggested
by
some
, that the militia
would be adequate. What?
Because
in the
course
of
the war
against
the
British
, when we had not
disciplined
troops at all times, and in
sufficient
numbers to
oppose
to the enemy, the militia of
necessity
were obliged
to act, and
sometimes
acted well, will it be
said
that
they were preferable to the
disciplined
troops? we know
they were not, though
occasionally
they
discovered
bravery, and were obedient to orders. But
supposing
them equal; what is more,
supposing
them preferable;
are the inhabitants of the
western
country, to be
perpetually
harrassed
with militia duty? To be
subject
to
the
necessity
of quiting their occupations, and to be
occasionally
soldiers
? Did not the militia during the war
with Britain, groan under the
necessity
of being obliged
to act? And
shall
this grievance
exist
to the
western
country, ten years after that war has been terminated;
and when it is in the power of the government,
knowing
the
seat
of war with the
savages
, to have regular
troops to
oppose
them; not as in the
case
of the
British
,
where by means of their flects, the war was
suddenly
transferable from place to place, and the militia were
obliged to act, in order to
assist
the parts of our army,
until a greater force
should
arrive.
Militia! That is, let every man do his own fighting.
Why not every man his
smithing
,
masoning
, weaving,
and tayloring, as well?
Because
it will be better to
have
persons
who will make a
business
of each
particular
branch, and
stick
to it. It does not do to be a Jack
of all trades. Well, and why plow a
spell
, and then
fight? But the riflemen of the
western
country, are
the
best
calculated to fight the Indians. Well:
enlist
such
, and give them rifles, and make an abiding body
of them, that the country may have a permanent force
to depend upon. But they will not
enlist
. I engage
it, if you pay them well. When militia are called
upon they are not
those
that are drafted that go; they
are
substitutes
. They
cost
high to
those
that employ
them; and being the
refuse
of the country, they are
good for nothing when they are employed. But let
those
that are drafted go. Well; draft them from the
inland parts of the government, that have not families
to defend on the frontiers, and
see
what will then be
said
. Volunteers are the thing, making a
sudden
incursion
.
If they make a
sudden
incursion
, they will make
a
sudden
recursion
, and leave the matter as they found
it. A large army cannot find the Indians. They will
run away. Well,
stay
till they come back. Occupy
the country; and occupying it, then prepare to treat.
Treating at their own towns you will not be
imposed
upon by raggamuffins
passing
for chiefs; or tribes
treating
who are at peace already, and are
so
situated
that
they dare not go to war. But the
western
country is
not worth defending at the expence of a
standing
army.
Give it up then;
absolve
us from our allegiance, and
let us make terms with the
British
who have the
command
of the Indians. For an army at
least
equal to
the
present
establishment
must
be kept up;
otherwise
all the treaties that can be made, will be of no avail;
for a
present
visible
force is the only
sanction
of
engagements
,
with the
savages
; more
especially
in their
present
situation
, impelled, and
supported
by the
traders
of Britain. I will not
say
how far the government
takes a part, as there are different opinions on this
subject
.
But it is not the
western
country only that you
are defending. It is the very
sea
coast
settlements
. For
if we give way, and return to the
east
of the
mountains
,
will not the enemy come to the
east
after us?
If he finds no
horses
or blankets, on the one
side
, will
he not
pursue
his rout to the other? If he
misses
a
scalp
short
of the Schuylkill, will it not do to take it there?
The fact is, that the command of lake Erie, by
posts
established
upon it, and from thence to the
Wabash
,
are the only means of
repressing
the Indians; not
so
much from the actual force of
these
establishments
as
from the effect upon the imagination of the enemy; for
seeing
the
boldness
of the
step
, they will count more
upon our force than they ought; as at
present
they
count
less
; and it will refute the
British
traders, who
deny the
cession
of the country made by that
government
.
But more
especially
, by encouraging our
traders
under the protection of our
posts
, a commerce will
be
established
with the
savages
, under the
nose
of the
British
, and we may equally have the direction of them.
Surely any man of the
smallest
reflection
must
know,
that a treaty and giving goods, is but a
transitory
act,
and can have but a
transitory
effect; whereas the means
that will reduce, and the
interests
that will conciliate,
ought to be permanent to be of any
use
.
BOOK III.
CHAP. I.
The
circumstance
of having been at the
levee, and having made a
speech
in the
beer-
house
, which had been much
approved
,
and above all, it being announced
that he was a candidate for
state
employment
,
had made the bog-trotter a pretty
general theme of
conversation
. Sundry
persons
who were expectants upon
government
,
had procured
themselves
to be
introduced to him, as
supposing
that when
in office, by and bye, he might have it in
his power to do them
service
. Even by
those
that were in government, in the
legislative
, executive, or diplomatic line,
he was not neglected. Several members
of
Congress
had left cards.
Assistants
,
and deputy
assistants
in offices, foreign
consuls
, two or three directors and
cashiers
of banks, had waited upon him and paid
him their compliments.
His name became known in the gay
world, and by a gradual introduction, he
had become acquainted in
some
of the
best
families of the city. The ladies, in
general
,
were much taken with him. They
thought him a plain, frank, blunt
spoken
Irish
gentleman; not
harrassing
them with
deep
observations
, drawn from books, or
an
ostentation
of learning; but always
saying
something
gallant, and
complimentary
of their
persons
, or
accomplishments
;
such
as God love your
shoul
, my dear
cratur, but you are de beauty of de
world. Sleeping or waking, I could
take you to my heart, and ate you wid
de very love o' d' my
shoul
dat I have
for you. De look o' d' dur face, like
de
sun
or de moon, run trugh me, and
burn up like a coal o' d' de fire; dat I
am
shick
and fainting to take du to my
arms, my dear cratur.
Declarations of this nature, made
without
any ambiguity, and warm and violent
in their nature, had rendered him, as I
have
said
, pretty generally a favorite of
the ladies: far indeed beyond any thing
which the Captain,
simple
and ignorant
of the world, had ever imagined: his
astonishment
therefore was not
small
, a
day or two after this, when walking the
street
, he
saw
a carriage,
pass
by, with
a gentleman and lady; and on
asking
whose
carriage that was, and who the
gentleman that was in it; for he was
struck
with
some
resemblance
of the
bog-trotter
;
it was
answered
, that it was the
carriage of Mr.
Haberdasher
, a merchant
of the city,
whose
lady was taking an
airing it would
seem
with Major O'Regan,
a member of
Congress
, or
Ambassador
,
or
something
that was
just
come to town.
God Almighty! thought the Captain; is
it
possible
. I
see
that I have been a fool,
all my life, and though
just
going out of
the world, am but beginning to get
experience
to live in it. I had been led by
his own confidence, and by the opinion of
others, though with great doubts, on my
part, to
suppose
it
possible
that he might
have come to be of
some
respect
in
government
,
the
discharge
of an office,
requiring
rather
solid
, than brilliant parts;
but that in
so
short
a time, or indeed,
after
any period, he
should
become a
favorite
of females of
taste
and
fashion
,
never entered into my head at all: and
forsooth
they have given him the
appellation
of Major, though he is about as much
a Major as my
horse
.
Such were the ideas which the
circumstance
of Teague in a carriage with a fine
lady, naturally produced in his mind.
Nor indeed
should
we think them
unreasonable
,
were it not that we know there
was nothing extraordinary in the
case
.
For though
abstractedly
considered
, it
would
seem
improbable that the female
mind of great delicacy, and refinement,
should
be captivated by a rough and
gross
object; yet we know that the fact is in
nature, and we
must
leave it to the
philosophers
to account for it. Nor will this
be any difficult
task
, when we
consider
the
powers of imagination. Here was a new
object, unknown as to its origin, and
high as to its
pretensions
; and what is
novel
,
and not fully comprehended, and lofty
in its nature, has a
supereminent
dominion
over the human mind. Hence the proverb,
far fetched, and dear bought, is good
for ladies. But on the
present
occasion
,
a particular principle operated in favour
of the bog-trotter: viz. the
taste
and
fashion
of the day. For, as, in the age of
chivalry, a knight was the only object in
request
, and at the beginning of the
revolution
in America, a Baron, or a Count
from France or Germany was the ton,
so
now,
since
the adoption of the federal
constitution
, the appurtenant officers of
government are the only characters in
vogue. And as in the
first
instance
, mere
squires
had been taken for knights, and
passed
very well, and in the
second
case
,
taylors and barbers, had
slurred
themselves
for gentry or nobility, what could hinder
the bog-trotter from availing
himself
of
the whim of the day, and be taken for
a
person
qualified to fill any place in
government
,
from the bare pretending to
it? And being once taken for
such
, what
prodigy was there in his being in
request
with the females, and all the
first
families
of the city, who might be ambitious, and
vie with each other, in having him married
to a niece or a daughter, that
so
being
raised
above plebians by the connection,
they might be
considered
as of a
pratrician
degree? Let the principle be what it
would, whether
taste
, or ambition, the
fact was, that the bog-trotter was courted
and
carressed
by all the
first
people: there
could be no card party without Major
O'Regan. A young lady
sitting
by a
gentleman
in any
house
, and
seeing
him
pass
by, would
start
up, and run to
the window and
say
, O, there is Major
O'Regan. When he was in company,
and would laugh, and put out his tongue,
as if he was about to
sing
, Lilibullero, the
young ladies would laugh too; not that
there was any
jest
, in what he or they
said
, but
just
because
the Major had
laughed
.
When he would put out his great
paw to touch the hand of any of them,
O, la! Major, one would
say
, O, now!
Major, another would
say
; don't now
Major, a third would exclaim, rather to
attract his attention, than to
repress
his
advances. The fact was, there
seemed
to
be a kind of Teagueomania,
amongst
the
females,
so
that all idea of excellence,
personal
, or mental was centered in him,
and all common lovers, were neglected,
or
repulsed
on his account. A
melancholy
instance
of this kind occured to the
Captain the following day, when walking
by the margin of the river on which the
city
stood
, and towards a grove of wood,
which
skirted
it on the
south
, he
observed
a man
sitting
on a tuft of the bank, with
his head reclining forward, in a melancholy
position
, and looking down upon the
wave beneath him, in the manner in which
Achilles is
described
by the poet Homer,
as looking on the purple ocean, and
complaining
to the
goddess
Thetis of the injury
done to him, when the maid
Brisfeis
had
been taken from his arms by the order of
Agamemnon.
Sensibly
touched with an
appearance of woe in any
case
, the
Captain
could not avoid advancing, and
accosting
him: Sir,
said
he,----but what
need I take up the time of the reader with
stating
particularly the words of the
address
:
it is
sufficient
to
say
, that with all
the
necessary
delicacy, the captain gave
him to
understand
that he took a part in
his misfortune, if there was any upon his
mind, and would think
himself
extremely
fortunate if by language, or acts, he could
alleviate his griefs.
Sir,
said
the other, it is
impossible
. I
am an unhappy man, who have been for
some
months in love with a young lady of
this city, and
whose
affections I had
conceived
myself
to have engaged by the
most
unremitting attention. I had counted
upon her, as my wife, and in all my
industry
in
business
, which is that of a
merchant
,
I had my thoughts directed to the
provision
, I hoped, to have it in my
power, to make, in order to
support
her
with dignity and affluence. Yet within
these
few days, her attention is engaged,
and her affections alienated by a certain
Major O'Regan, that is, or, is about to
be engaged in
some
public employment.
Major O'Regan,
said
the Captain,
laughing; is it
possible
!
Do you know him,
said
the gentleman?
Know him,
said
the Captain; he is my
bog-trotter; he has been my valet de
chambre this three years; and of late my
hostler
and boot cleaner, in my travels to
this city. I believe I could prevail with
him for a pair of breeches, or
so
, to
resign
his
pretensions
to the lady.
At this, the eye of the inamorato began
to
resume
its
lustre
; and the
paleness
of his
countenance to give way to
some
freshness
of complexion. Give me your name,
and the name of the lady,
said
the
Captain
,
and call upon me to morrow, at
the Indian Queen, about nine o'clock, and
I will endeavor to make
such
terms on
your behalf with this
same
Major O'Regan,
that he will give you no farther trouble,
on the
score
of the lady.
The inamorato
expressed
his
thankfulness
with great animation and fervour;
and accepted the invitation to wait upon
him at the time and place
proposed
,
informing
him, at the
same
time, that his
name was Williams, and that of the lady,
was M`Cracken, a daughter of an
alderman
of the city of that name.
The Captain coming home,
addressed
the bog-trotter as follows: Major
O'Regan
,
said
he, for that I find is the title
which they have given you, there is a young
lady of this town of the name of M`
Cracken
,
whom you have by
some
means
engaged
to think favorably of you, to the
neglect of a former admirer, a Mr.
Williams
,
a merchant, of this city. This
gentleman had a claim upon her from a
prior attention, and though there is no
municipal law that
constitutes
it a wrong
in you to interfere; yet humanity will
dictate that it is a wrong.
Because
it is a
small
thing to a man
whose
affections are
not engaged; and who has yet
wasted
no
time upon an object, to decline attention
to it, or
relinquish
it. But to him who
has
set
his mind upon this or that lady, it
is death to be repulfed, and a man of
honor
and delicacy of feeling, who
sees
the
advances of another which are well
received
,
will not interfere, even though the
object might be agreeable to him. Much
less
will he
amuse
himself
at the expence
of another, by paying attention when it
is his own vanity alone that he
consults
, in
shewing
in what point of view he could
stand
if he
should
think proper to
persist
.
I hope better things of you Teague, and
that you will conduct
yourself
on the
principles
of honour and humanity; you will
resign
this flirt, for
such
I deem her, who
---- he was going to
say
, who could be
tickled with you; but having a point to
carry with Teague, he
chose
to
use
soft
words; who, continued he, could
so
readily change one lover for another.
What
security
have you of the affections
of one of
so
versatile
a mind, Mr.
Williams
is a merchant, and has cloths in his
store
: he will give you the pattern of a
pair of breeches to decline your
pretensions
,
and
resign
the jade to him who had
first
cast
his eye upon her.
Teague, much more from this
last
part
of the argument, than from the fine
sentiments
of delicacy, &c. which were laid
down in the
first
of it,
consented
to
relinquish
the dulcinea; and
so
when Mr.
Williams
called at the hour
proposed
, an order
for the making of a pair of breeches was
given and the bog-trotter pledged his
word, that he neither would laugh, talk,
walk, or ogle with her any more.
Shortly after this, while reading a
newspaper
,
the Captain heard two men
conversing
at the
opposite
end of the
saloon
in
which they
sat
, one of them
expressing
his concern that having a
cause
to be tried
before the court then
sitting
, his lawyer
Mr. Hardicknute could not attend, being
indisposed
, and as it was alledged, from
a
disappointment
in love, by a
Miss
Thimbleton
,
who was of late, as it appeared,
taken with a certain Major O'Regan, an
Irish
gentleman of
some
note, who had
paid attention to her.
Enquiring the
residence
of the
gentleman
,
and being informed, the Captain
ever prompt to do offices of humanity,
immediately calling for Teague, who was
in the bar room with the waiter getting
him to write a love letter for him,
set
out on a
visit
to lawyer Hardicknute, and
being admitted to his chamber, where he
lay
languishing
in bed,
accosted
him,
giving
him to
understand
that he knew the
cause
of his complaint, not by feeling his
pulse
as did the
physician
of Demetrius,
who was in love with Stratonice: nor by
any power of conjuring; but
simply
by
hearing it from a client who was
interested
in his recovery; and that in
consequence
of this information he had come to relieve
him, and had brought the identical Major
O'Regan along with him, who for half a
johannes was ready to
resign
all
pretensions
to the lady. This the Captain
presumed
,
from his influence with the
Irishman
,
and from his
succeeding
on the
former
occasion
.
The
sick
lawyer at this
sat
up; and
having put on on his gown and
slippers
,
expressed
great thanks to the Captain and
the Major, and very readily handed a half
johannes from his bureau, and calling for
pen, ink and paper, for he was not
sufficiently
restored
to go to his office, he
signified
that it would be proper the Major
should
give him
some
instrument
of
writing
as evidence of the contract. It was
agreed on the part of the Captain and the
bog-trotter; and the lawyer wrote as
follows
:
Know all men by
these
presents
, that
I Teague O'Regan, Major, am held and
firmly bound unto John Hardicknute, in
the
sum
of one hundred pounds, money
of the United States, well and truly to be
paid to him the
said
John, his heirs,
executors
,
administators
, or
assigns
. Given
under my hand and
seal
this
second
day of
June, in the year of our Lord one
thousand
seven
hundred and ninety-one.
The condition of the above obligation is
such
, That if I the
said
Teague O'Regan,
shall
withdraw all attention,
courtship
,
or wooing on my behalf from a certain
Martha Thimbleton, lady, then the
said
obligation to be void,
otherwise
to
remain
in full force and virtue.
his
TEAGUE O'REGAN
mark.
Signed,
sealed
and delivered
in the
presence
of
JOHN FARRAGO.
This matter being fully
settled
, the
Captain and the bog-trotter took their
leave and departed. On their way home,
a man was
seen
to run
across
the
street
,
dressed
in black, but without hat, coat,
or breeches on. The Captain conceived
it
must
be
some
mad
sans
culotte, or
unbreeched
person
that had come over from
Paris, and was running through the
streets
here in order to bring about a revolution;
but on enquiry, he was informed, that it
was the Revd. Mr. M`Whorter, a young
clergyman, who had been deranged in his
understanding
on account of a preference
given by
Miss
Fiddle to a certain Major
O'Regan, who had
seemed
to have
engaged
her affections; that it was
first
discovered
on the preceding Sunday, when in
his prayer,
instead
of
saying
give
us this day our daily bread, he repeated,
give us this day our daily
Miss
Fiddle, and
instead
of
saying
, deliver us from evil,
as he ought to have done, he
said
, deliver
us from Major O'Regan; that ever
since
he had been getting
worse
, and now had
thrown off a part of his garments, and
exposing
himself
in public, appeared to be
mad altogether.
The Captain thinking on the
subject
,
was about to parody that line of the poet
and to
say
;
Ye Gods what havock does O'Regan make
Amongst
your works.
But
repressing
all poetical flights, he
wished
to
lose
no time, but as
speedily
as
possible
to wait upon the unfortunate
ecclesiastic
,
and by
satisfying
his mind,
remove
his derangement. Accordingly
pursuing
the clergyman, and having had
him
seized
and conveyed to a chamber;
he endeavored to make him
sensible
that
Major O'Regan, the
cause
of his
misfortune
,
who was there
present
, was ready
to quit claim to
Miss
Fiddle, and give him
no
cause
of
uneasiness
any farther. For
this, on their way, the bog-trotter, in
consideration
of an
interest
in the clergyman's
prayers, had
promised
to do. But poor
Mr. M`Whorter was too far gone. He
could talk of nothing, but
some
incoherent
jargon
consisting
of a mixture of
scripture
and profane language, one while about
Miss
Fiddle and Major O'Regan;
another
while of Daniel in the Lion's den, and
Jonas in the whale's belly, and the Devil
running into
swine
. He would imagine
sometimes
that the devil was in
himself
,
and would
squeel
like a pig.
The matter being thus
hopeless
, they
set
off to come home. On their way they
fell in with a man who called
himself
a
doctor
,
and had a
blistering
plaister
in his
hand, and a gallipot, and a
clyster
pipe
tyed with a
string
about his neck, and
hanging down his back, and had alarmed
two or three ladies
just
before, offering
his
services
in the way of his
profession
.
On enquiry, it was found, that it was
the celebrated doctor
Cataplasm
that had
lost
his
senses
, within three days
past
, on
account of a Major O'Regan, that was
likely to carry off
Miss
Blasm
, to whom
the doctor had been a
suitor
for
several
years, and with whom he had been
just
on
the point of marriage.
Despairing
from
the late experiment of doing any thing
with mad people, the Captain waved any
trouble with the doctor, but looking
sternly
at Teague; this will never do,
said
he:
I cannot reconcile it to
myself
to be in the
most
distant
way
accessary
to
so
much
mischief
; and as, from a deference to the
judgment of others, and to your
importunity
,
I have
suffered
myself
to be the
means of introducing you to this
sphere
,
I
must
take care to repair the injury as
far as may be in my power, or at
least
prevent any
increase
of it as much as
possible
.
If there is
some
talismanic
charm,
God knows what it is, in your
person
or
appearance, that makes you thus
formidable
to the peace and
happiness
of others
in giving this
success
amongst
the females,
and if you have not
generosity
, or moral
sense
of duty, to
use
your advantage
consistent
with humanity, it is full time you
should
be checked and drawn from this
sphere
altogether, and
sent
to your
former
bog-trotting, or put into the
state
if you can get there, that
honest
men may
marry their wenches,
whose
affections
they had
previously
engaged.
The bog-trotter was
somewhat
obstreperous
;
or as the vulgar
say
,
obstrapalous
,
on the
occasion
; and
seemed
to
signify
that he would not
desist
; but would
pay attention to whom he thought proper.
The Captain
saw
that it was a difficult
matter to lay the devil he had
raised
; and
his hopes
rested
in this, that he was but
the bubble of a day, and that though
light-headed young women in the
unfortunate
cases
mentioned, had given him a
visible
preference, yet it was rather to
torture
their former lovers with a view to
try the
strength
of their
passion
than with
any intention
seriously
to make choice of
him, and finally accept him for a
husband
.
For he could not think it
possible
that a
woman of
fashion
, and education, would
ultimately be willing to give her hand to
such
a
raggamussin
. If indeed, he could
come to be a judge, or a governor,
such
a thing might take place; but as it was, it
seemed
to outrage all credibility.
In this he was
mistaken
; for but the
very next day, he was waited on by Mr.
Mutchkin, a merchant of the city, who
was in the
wholesale
and retail way as a
grocer, and who had an only daughter,
Miss
Mutchkin, to whom the
Irishman
had made his
most
serious
proposals
. It
was to her, by the
assistance
of the waiter,
that he had been writing love letters:
Mr. Mutchkin, a cautious man, before
he would give his
consent
to the match,
thought proper to call upon the Captain,
whom he
understood
to be the uncle, or
guardian of the young gentleman, with a
view of enquiring into his expectations.
Expectations!
said
the Captain, why
just
this; that if he
should
chance to get
into office, it is well, and if not he
must
return to his bog-trotting. Bog-trotting!
said
the merchant. Aye; bog-trotting,
said
the Captain: what
else
would he do.
It is but ten days, or thereabouts,
since
he quitted it; and
since
, by taking him to
levees, and beer-
houses
, and rubbing and
scrubbing
him, and teaching him to dance,
and giving him
some
lessons
of manners,
he has been made fit to appear in the gay
world. He has but that pair of breeches
that you
see
to his
backside
, and a pattern
not made up yet, that merchant Williams
gave him; and for my part I have done
all for him that I can do: There is
just
the truth Mr. Mutchkin; and if you
chuse
to take him for a
son
-in-law, you are
welcome; but as, thank God, I have
preserved
a principle of candour and
honesty
all my life, I will not deceive on
this
occasion
; and if the match
should
prove unfortunate, you will not have me
to blame,
Mr. Mutchkin,
expressed
by the
staring
of his eye, his
astonishment
; and as
soon
as he could
speak
, thanked the
Captain
for his candour, and declared his
resolution
that if Major O'Regan as he had
the
assurance
to call
himself
,
should
again
come to his
house
, he would turn him out
of doors; and that if his daughter
should
give him the
least
countenance for the
future
,
he would
disown
her entirely: He
had taken the
greatest
pains with her in
her education;
she
had been taught all the
polite
accomplishments
that could become
a lady; dancing,
music
, painting,
reading
French, the Belles Lettres,
geography
,
&c. and if, after all this,
she
would
throw
herself
away on a raggamuffin to
the
discredit
of the family, he would no
longer take notice of her.
Fair, and
softly
,
said
the Captain; I
have a word of advice to give on the
subject
.
It is true, I have not travelled
much through the world;
so
as to
visit
France, Italy, Spain, or Portugal;
nevertheless
,
I have
some
general knowledge
of the principles of human nature; not
only from books, but from my own
observations
,
of the
small
circumstances
that
have fallen in my way, and reflection
upon
them; and have found, that in the
intellectual
province, as well as in material
works, art
accomplishes
more than force;
nay, as in
mechanism
, the arch is
strengthened
by the very weight you put upon it,
so
, where the imagination is concerned, the
attachment is fixed by an
opposition
to it.
Hence, it is, that the
dissuasion
of parents,
guardians, or friends is often
so
ineffectual,
with their daughters or wards, in matters
of love. It will behoove you, on this
occasion
, in order to
accomplish
your
object
,
to conceal your knowledge of the
circumstances
communicated; to allow
the bog-trotter free
ingress
and
egress
as
usual
, and to affect to
speak
of him with
respect
. Leave it to me to
say
such
things to the young lady, as under
pretence
of recommending her lover, will be
effectual to
disgust
her, and remove her
attachment,
Mr. Mutchkin
impressed
with the
sincerity
and good
sense
of the Captain,
consented
to be guided by him in this
business
,
and accordingly going home was
silent
to
the mother and daughter with
respect
to
the
conversation
he had with the old
gentleman
,
who was
considered
as the uncle
of Teague: and the following day when
the Captain waited upon the family, and
was introduced by Mr. Mutchkin, who
retiring under pretence of
business
, left
him alone with the daughter and mother
to make
use
of the means he had
proposed
.
For Mr. Mutchkin well knew that
O'Regan
was a great favorite with the mother;
and that it would be as difficult to convince
her as the daughter, of the
imposition
in his
character. Nay, as
she
had promoted
the match, her pride,
unless
she
herself
was the
first
to detect the
imposture
,
would hinder her from
seeing
it, or at
least
acknowledging it at all.
Being
seated
,
conversation
ensued
,
and Mrs. Mutchkin, paid the Captain
many compliments on the fine figure and
address
of his nephew.
Miss
Mutchkin,
hung down her head, and
blushed
, as
being
in the
presence
of the uncle of her lover
and hearing the name of Major O'Regan
mentioned. Why madam,
said
the
Captain
,
I
understand
that the
bog-trotter
, has been well received in your family.
It is true I am not his uncle, nor is he a
Major;
nevertheless
many uncles have
had
worse
nephews; and there have been
Majors that did not perhaps ever
see
so
much
service
: for I have
understood
from
himself
that he was
inlisted
once when he
was drunk, and was a while in the
barracks
in Dublin; but got off when the
matter came to be examined, and it was
found that advantage had been taken of
him. For the Lord Lieutenant had given
strict
orders, that in the
enlistments
the
utmost
fairness
should
be
used
; nor,
indeed
was it
necessary
in time of peace, to
take advantage;
because
there were men
enough to be got voluntarily, and
deliberately
to enter the
service
. Nor indeed
had Teague
himself
any objections to be a
soldier
, but that his
constitution
had not
given him that courage which is
necessary
to enable a man to face an enemy with fire
arms: He could cudgel at a fair, or the
like, where he was
supported
by others
that would take the weight of the battle
off his hands; but except to
wrestle
at
carnish
hug, as he calls it, with a
hostler
,
now and then, I never knew him fond of
any contention
whatsoever
. I
understand
that he has been fortunate enough to
render
himself
agreeable to the young lady
your daughter, and I congratulate
myself
on the
prospect
of having
so
accomplished
a young woman to be the wife of
my
domestic
. I have had him now
these
three years. I bought him out a
ship
of
Irish
servants
. He has been always
faithful
to me in the offices in which I employed
him,
such
as
brushing
boots, and rubbing
down my
horse
.
It
is true his manners
were a little rude at
first
, but I have
taken
a good deal of pains to teach him
some
of the outlines of a decent behaviour,
such
as to blow his
nose
with a handkerchief,
and keep from breaking wind in company,
a practice to which he was a good deal
addicted at his
first
setting
out; and
though he takes long
strides
as you may
see
, from wearing brogues, and
bog-trotting
;
yet in the
course
of time, this
and other habits may be broke, by being
in good company. He has made
considerable
improvement in the
short
time, I
have taken pains with him. Though but
ten days
since
he was heaved down, and
curried and
brushed
up for a gentleman,
he has learned to chew food, without
greasing
his chin and cheeks. If he
should
fall into the hands of a lady of
taste
, as
he is like to do,
she
may improve him
still
more. It will be of particular advantage
to him to get a woman that can write and
read; as I
understand
Miss
Mutchkin can
do very well; for as he can neither read
nor write
himself
, it is
necessary
that there
should
be one of a family that can. He
has been fortunate at the taverns where
we lodged to get the waiters to write and
read billets to ladies; but
such
cannot be
always at hand for
these
things; but a wife
may. It is true his hopes in government
are uncertain, as to being an
ambassador
or
consul
, but he may get to be a valet
de chambre to one of
these
: and though
the ambition of
Miss
Mutchkin may not be
so
much flattered, as to be the lady of a
minister
, yet true
happiness
is to be found
in contentment; and the love
she
has for
his
person
, may make amends for the
want of rank and honor; much more for
the want of fortune; for riches are but
dross
, and the maid of a kitchen may be as
happy as the
mistress
in the parlour. His
fortune indeed is not much. He has
nothing
of his own, but what
dress
he wears,
and a pattern of a pair of breeches, not
yet made up. My
estate
is but
small
,
consisting
in a farm, and implements of
husbandry
, with a couple of
horses
, one
of which I have rode from home, while
he bog-trotted by my
side
.
Nevertheless
,
if he marries
Miss
Mutchkin I will
endeavor
to do
something
for him, and for two
or three years to come will engage to
find him in breeches and
waistcoats
.
The young lady was confounded and
withdrew. The mother was
silent
, and
with all her heart
wished
the Captain gone,
that
she
might
digest
her mortification in
private. The Captain
saw
all this; but
without
seeming
to
see
it,
preserved
a
grave countenance, and with
some
apology
of having an engagement
so
that he could
not have the honor of a longer
conversation
,
he took his leave.
The dialogue that took place after this
between the mother and the daughter,
may be more
easily
imagined than
expressed
.
It was
concluded
that when
O'Regan came next to the
house
, the
porter
should
be ready with a
cowskin
to
give him a
suitable
reception.
Mr. Mutchkin coming in was made
acquainted
with the
discovery
of Major
O'Regan's
history
. Affecting to be as
much
astonished
as
themselves
, he
observed
,
that it would be however proper
to
dismiss
him with civility, as he had been
received in the capacity of a
suitor
. Here
Miss
Mutchkin again
blushed
, not as at
first
, with an affected
blush
of
modesty
,
when Major O'Regan was at any time
mentioned, but with the
blush
of
confusion
and
shame
. The mother
discovering
in
her countenance all the emotions of
wounded pride, and ungovernable
resentment
,
avowed her determination to have
him received with a
cowskin
by the
porter
.
Mr. Mutchkin, affecting to
acquiesce
,
as
these
were matters in which he
did not
wish
to concern, did but confirm
the
resolution
.
Accordingly, that evening, when the
bog-trotter being on the point of marriage
as he thought, came to take tea with
Miss
Mutchkin, ringing the bell, and being
admitted, a
stout
fellow, an
Englishman
,
who
served
in the capacity of Porter,
being prepared with a very heavy
cowskin
,
made an attack upon him. The
Irishman
exclaimed, and called out for
Miss
Mutchkin. O! God love your
dear
ladyship
,
Miss
Mutchkin; by
shaint
Patrick; by de holy
apostles
, I
shall
be
kilt and murdered into de bargain! O! I
shall
be kilt and murdered. God love
your
shoul
stop
wid your
cowskin
, till I
say
may prayers; and
spare
my life; O!
I
shall
be kilt and murdered, O! dis night,
in de
house
here.
Miss
Mutchkin, where
is your dear
ladyship
, to look upon me
wid your eyes, and
save
me from dis
bateing? O! I am kilt and murdered.
Saying
these
words the porter had
kicked him out of the
house
, and
shutting
the door, left him to his exclamations in
the
street
.
Coming home, to the Captain, he made
a woeful complaint of the
disaster
that had
befallen him; which the Captain took
care not to alleviate, but
increase
,
alledging
,
that it
must
have been
some
former
lover of the lady, who was
exasperated
at
the preference given, and took this method
of revenge; that he now
saw
how
dangerous
it was to interfere with men of
spirit
in their
courtships
, and he ought to
be more careful for the future.
CHAP. II
Containing
Observations
.
HAVING given the preceding
history
, and put my
name to it, there is no man that knows me, will
doubt of the truth of it. For I have always
considered
the
first
character of an
historian
to be veracity; and in
all my former
compositions
, have endeavored to
preserve
that character. There being therefore no doubt
of the facts, it will remain only to account for them,
and indeed, though we have partly done it already, in
some
observations
we have made, yet this, and the
like
circumstances
which occur every day in life, of
Teague O'Regans and bog-trotters, being the favorites
of ladies in preference to the
most
accomplished
men,
is
so
contrary to what we would expect, that it may
deserve
a more minute developement of the
causes
and
principles. In early times, and even yet
amongst
simple
and uninformed people, the effect has been
attributed
to love potions, or witchcraft; that is, either to
some
drug, or draught affecting the nerves, and
deranging
the brain; or to
some
supernatural
power
operating on the faculties. But exploding
these
, we
shall
endeavor to explain the phenomenon upon the
common principles of the affections of the heart, and
the power of the imagination. But it
must
be
presumed
that in general, advantage of
person
, good
sense
, and virtue prevail with the females, and where
the
opposite
is the
case
, it is to be
considered
as out of
the common
course
of choice. Why it ever
should
be
so
, may depend on this; that a Teague O'Regan
having
little
sensibility
of nerve, has all that apathy from
nature which the man of
address
has from habit, and
more
steadily
,
because
the one is nature, the other art:
and
coolness
in love, is a great
secret
of
success
.
Sensibility
is irritable,
unpersevering
,
desponding
,
extravagant
;
and hence it is that no man who is deeply
enamoured of a lady before
she
has conceived
some
attachment on her part, has an equal chance to be
acceptable. The fond love of a refined mind,
produces
silliness
, in proportion to the delicacy of the feelings;
and the
contrast
being more
observable
, the
wise
man
becomes, or appears to be the greater fool. The
Teague O'Regan makes love without any heart at all;
he attends upon a lady as he would tread mortar:
flatters her as he would
speak
to a parrot, or
stroke
a
cat, without a
single
sensation
to
disturb
him. The
appearance of
security
on the part of the lover, gives
the lady to
suppose
that he is
conscious
of advantages,
and of
course
that there
must
be
such
which
she
does
not yet
discover
: or conceiving that
she
has not yet
absolutely
engaged him,
she
makes it an object to
inspire
his attachment, and the very
exercise
of her own
passions
kindles a flame; for hopes and fears are the aliments of
love. A Teague O'Regan has no
sentiment
of his own,
and therefore he approves all the
reason
, and laughs at
all the wit of the lady;
so
that putting her in love with
herself
,
she
becomes in love with him. A man of
sense
,
expresses
it; but if contrary to the lady's
sense
,
she
thinks it
nonsense
, and he becomes the Teague
O'Regan in her judgment.
Again, a Teague O'Regan is
repressed
by no
sense
of honour, or regard to a permanent
happiness
, from
passing
himself
for what he is not, and
practising
imposition
,
he
imposes
; talking of his great relations when
he has none, and of an
estate
when the right owner, as
the
Irish
phrase
is, keeps him out of it, and provided
he can obtain the lady, he never thinks of the
catastrophe
when the deception is
discovered
.
A Teague O'Regan is
less
opposed
by his rivals;
because
no one
supposes
that he can prevail. He is
assisted
by the female acquaintance of the lady,
because
they
wish
her mortified by making a bad choice. In
affairs of love there is no lady has a friend except a
father
,
an uncle, or a brother; not always a mother,
seldom
a
sister
, but never any one
else
.
Because
the
pride of a mother may be hurt by the defect of attention
to
herself
; the
jealousy
of a
sister
is
roused
, even tho'
provided for,
lest
it
should
appear
she
had not married
equally well; and therefore the greater the fool, the
more friends he has with all the world, in his advances.
But
setting
all
these
principles
aside
, a particular
circumstance
,
as in the late
case
of the bog-trotter may
operate for the
season
, and make it an object to be
addressed
by him.
I
shall
conclude
these
strictures
, by laying down
some
rules, for a prudent father, or guardian to correct the
imagination of a young lady, who appears to be
facinated
with a bog-trotter; and in doing this, I conceive
I
shall
render
essential
service
to humanity. It is a
painful thing, having accumulated property, for the
sake
of a child; and having taken pains to improve and
polish
, to have her thrown away upon a
beast
; for
according
to the
expression
of the poet,
some
men are
beasts
, compared with others.
Man differs more from man,
Than man from
beast
.
Wilmot.
As love then is the offspring of the imagination,
reason
has nothing to do with it. Ridicule is the only
remedy. Never let the Teague O'Regan be
opposed
,
or excluded from the
house
; but invited, and laughed
at; in the mean time giving the young lady no
reason
to
suppose
that it is
suspected
she
could
possibly
have
any fancy for
such
a
person
. The father or guardian
may engage
some
persons
of both
sexes
, in confidence,
to join in the ridicule, and relate or invent incidents of his
absurdities
; for as the bog-trotter is making an attack
upon the honour and
happiness
of the family, it is
self-defence
,
and
justifiable
to counteract him by
stratagem
,
when open force will not avail. No object that is made
ridiculous can appear amiable; and as to what is
respectable
,
we depend much more upon the opinion of
others, than our own. If a lover is
opposed
, the lady
attributes it to an old
musty
taste
in the father, or to
envy and
jealousy
in others, and out of pride
she
will
support
him; whereas if he is ridiculed,
she
becomes
ashamed
of him, and gives him up. I have thought it
worth while to give this hint;
because
the greater part
of our romances and comedies in the
English
language
are calculated to depreciate the
respect
which a young
lady ought to have for the opinion of aged and grave
persons
; and to confirm her in taking the Teague
O'Regan of her own choice. For all
such
are
usually
represented
as old humdrum curmudgeons, or grany's
whose
judgment is not worth regarding, and
whose
taste
, in affairs of love, as in their
dress
, is antiquated,
unfashionable
, and
absurd
; but the adventurers, and
fortune hunters, are all
possessed
of
taste
, and
spirit
,
and gallantry, and carry off the
damsel
and make her
happy. They
stop
just
at the marriage, and give no
view of the
disgust
, repentance, and
unhappiness
that
ensues
.
BOOK IV.
CHAP. I.
Taking
advantage of the humiliated
state
of mind in which the bog-trotter now
was, from the late
cowskining
, he had
received, the Captain thought he could
be drawn off from an extreme attention
to the ladies, and engaged to apply to the
qualifying
himself
for
state
affairs.
Accordingly
continuing his
address
to him,
he
observed
, that though gallantry and
waiting upon ladies, was very agreeable,
yet prudence ought to be
observed
not to
create enemies, by
seeming
to
engross
their attachment,
so
as to put a man in
danger of duels, and
cowskinings
: at the
same
time it behooved a man not to
suffer
his gallantry to interfere with
business
;
and more
especially
in the early
stages
when he was about qualifying
himself
for
any occupation, or appointment; that, as
he (Teague O'Regan) was a candidate
for
state
affairs, he ought to check his
career
,
and withdraw
himself
for
some
time
from the gay circles, in order to acquire
some
small
things which were
necessary
to
the creditable and convenient
discharge
of
a public function;
such
as learning to
write his name if
possible
. As to learning
to read, or write generally that would
be a thing of years, if at all acquirable at
his period of life; but he might be taught
to imitate the few characters that
composed
his name, in
such
a manner as to
pass
for it;
so
that when he had to
sign
dispatches
or
commissions
, or the like, he need
not be under the
necessity
of making his
mark, like an Indian at a treaty; but
might do
something
that would
pass
for a
signature
in letters of the alphabet. So
providing him with a room, and placing
a table before him with an
inkstand
, and
strewing
some
papers, and
furnishing
him
with
spectacles
, as if he was already
making
out
dispatches
, he began to
instruct
him in making the letters, T, E, A, G,
U, E, &c.
But he had
scarcely
begun, when the
waiter coming in, delivered a parcel of
cards, and billets for Major O'Regan.
The Captain
instantly
reflecting that this
correspondence
with the gay world would
undo all that he was doing, and draw off the
bog-trotter from his
lessons
, as
soon
as
the
smart
of the
cowskining
had worn off,
saw
it
necessary
to read the billets as from
different
persons
, and containing
language
different from what was in them.
The cards being chiefly from men in public
employment, he read as they really were.
Opening one of the
largest
of the billets,
aye,
said
he, there is more of it. Do you
know this
Johnston
that
seems
so
much
enraged about
Miss
Muslin
to whom you
have paid
some
attention? by the bye, it
was a billet from
Miss
Muslin
, to
whose
acquaintance it would
seem
he had been
introduced
;
but the Captain read
Johnston
.
By de holy fathers,
said
Teague, I know
no
Johnston
. He
sends
you a challenge,
said
the Captain, to meet him on the
commons
this evening at
six
o'clock, with a
brace of
pistols
and a
second
to determine
whether you or he has the
best
right to
pay attention to this lady. We
shall
give
the billet as written by the lady, and as
read by the Captain.
As written by the Lady.
Would
wish
to have the
pleasure
of
Major O'Regan's company this evening at
tea. Lawyer Crabtree and Doctor Drug
will be here; and you know we
shall
split
our
sides
laughing at the ninnies. You're
so
full of your jokes that I want you here.
Dear Major, don't be engaged; but come.
Yours
sincerely
,
Patty
Muslin
.
Wedneday
Morning.
As read by the Captain.
SIR,
You will
instantly
do one of two things,
either
relinquish
your attention to
Miss
Muslin
, and be no more in her company;
or meet me this evening
precisely
at
six
o'clock, on the commons the back of the
Potter's-field, with a brace of
pistols
, and
a
second
, to take a
shot
. I
shall
have a
coffin ready, and a grave dug, for which
ever of us
shall
have
occasion
to make
use
of it.
Your humble
servant
,
Benjamin
Johnston
.
Major Teague O'Regan.
In the
same
manner, he read the other
billets, converting them from love letters
into challenges to fight with mortal
weapons
,
or into declarations of cudgeling,
and
cowskining
if he interfered any farther
in his attentions to
such
and
such
ladies.
The bog-trotter began to think the
devil
was broke
loose
upon him, and very
readily gave the Captain leave to write
answers
, declining all combats, and
declaring
his compliance with all that was
requested
of him.
The waiter was the only
person
who
by receiving the billets, and handing them
in the
absence
of the Captain, and reading
them to Teague, might inflame his mind
with the thoughts of the fine ladies, and
gay circles, from which he
seemed
to be
just
recovered: taking him
aside
, therefore,
and
accosting
him, Mathew,
said
he, for
that was the name of the waiter, I do
not know that I ought to find any fault
with your giving your
service
for
some
time
past
, to my Teague, in reading the
billets directed to him, and in writing his
answers
; but I
desire
that there may be
nothing more of this. As he is about to
be
closely
engaged for
some
time to come,
in acquiring
some
scholarship
, and
preparing
to enter on
some
state
appointment,
I do not
chuse
that his mind
should
be
taken
off by affairs of compliment or love.
All billets therefore directed to him, you
will for the future hand to me. The
waiter
promised
compliance, and
said
it was
all the
same
thing to him, as all he had
done, was to oblige the bog-trotter, and
if it was
disagreeable
to him (the Captain)
he
should
do no more of it.
However, Teague continuing
still
to
have
some
hankering after the company of
the ladies,
so
as not to have his mind
so
much upon learning to write the
characters
of his name as the Captain could have
wished
, he found it
necessary
to engage
the bar-keeper to
assist
him in
personating
now and then,
some
one who had come
to demand
satisfaction
for the interference
of the bog-trotter in affairs of love, that
by keeping up the alarm on his mind, he
might the better confine him to his
studies
.
According to the plan agreed upon the
bar-keeper knocking at the door, and the
Captain opening it a little, and demanding
his
business
; is there not a Major O'Regan
here, he would
say
(with a counterfeited
voice) who has
pretensions
to
Miss
Nubbin
?
(one of
those
who had
sent
billets) I
wish
to
see
the gentleman, and try if I can
put this
sword
in his body; (by the bye he
had a long
sword
) God love your
shoul
,
would O'Regan
say
, dear Captain, don't
let him in. I
shall
die wid fear upon de
spot
here; for I never fought a man in
cold blood in my life. Here the
bar-keeper
as recognizing the voice of O'Regan;
yes, would he
say
, I find he is here, let
me in, that I may put this through him;
I had paid my
addresses
to
Miss
Nubbin,
and was
just
about to
espouse
her, when,
unlike a gentleman, he has interferred,
and turned her head with his attention.
By the New
Jerusalem
I
shall
be through
his wind pipe in a
second
. Teague hearing
this and
raising
the
Irish
howl, would
redouble
his entreaties to the Captain not to
let him in. The Captain would
say
, Sir,
if you mean to make a
pass
at him, you
must
make it through me; for I
shall
not
stand
to
see
a
domestic
run through the
body, and his guts out, while mine are
in. You may therefore
desist
, or I
shall
have you taken into
custody
, as a
breaker
of the peace, With this he would
shut
the door, and the bar-keeper would go
off
cursing
and
swearing
that he would
have revenge for the
insult
that had been
offered him, by the
Irishman
.
By
these
artifices, certainly innocent
as the object was good; for it can be no
injury to deceive a man to his own
advantage
;
by
these
artifices, the Captain
succeeded
,
in preventing a
correspondence
with the gay world, and detaching the
mind of his pupil, from the gallantries of
love. But when any member of
Congress
or officer of
state
called upon him, he
was admitted. Traddle called
frequently
,
and declared that he had no
resentment
on account of Teague's
proposing
to be
his competitor, at the election in the
country
;
but
wished
him
success
in obtaining
some
appointment where his talents might
be
useful
.Sir,
I have
two objections to this duel
matter. The one is,
lest
I
should
hurt
you; and the other is,
lest
you
should
hurt me. I do not
see
any good it would
do me to put a bullet through any part
of your body. I could make no
use
of
you when dead, for any culinary
purpose
,
as I would a rabbit or a turkey. I am
no cannibal to feed on the
flesh
of men.
Why then
shoot
down a human creature,
of which I could make no
use
. A buffalo
would be better meat. For though your
flesh
might be delicate and tender; yet it
wants that
firmness
and
consistency
which
takes and retains
salt
. At any rate it would
not be fit for long
sea
voyages. You might
make a good barbecue, it is true, being of
the nature of a racoon or an
opossum
;
I
but people are not in the habit of
barbecuing
any thing human now. As to your
hide, it is not worth the taking off, being
little better than that of a year old colt.
It would
seem
to me a
strange
thing to
shoot
at a man that would
stand
still
to be
shot
at; in as much as I have been
heretofore
used
to
shoot
at things flying, or
running, or jumping. Were you on a
tree now like a
squirrel
, endeavouring to
hide
yourself
in the branches, or like a
racoon, that after much eyeing and
spying
I
observe
at length in the crotch of a tall
oak, with boughs and leaves intervening,
so
that I could
just
get a
sight
of his hinder
parts, I
should
think it
pleasurable
enough
to take a
shot
at you. But as it is, there
is no
skill
or judgment
requisite
either to
discover
or take you down.
As to
myself
, I do not much like to
stand
in the way of any thing that is harmful. I
am under
apprehensions
you might hit me.
That being the
case
, I think it
most
adviseable
to
stay
at a
distance
. If you want
to try your
pistols
, take
some
object, a tree
or a barn door about my
dimensions
. If
you hit that,
send
me word, and I
shall
acknowledge
that if I had been in the
same
place, you might
also
have hit me.

these
presents

I Teague O'Regan, Major, am held and
firmly bound unto John Hardicknute, in
the
sum

of the United States, well and truly to be
paid to him the

John, his heirs,

The condition of the above obligation is
such

Teague O'Regan,
shall
withdraw all attention,
courtship

JOHN FARRAGO.As written by the Lady.
Would
wish
to have the
pleasure
of
Major O'Regan's company this evening at
tea. Lawyer Crabtree and Doctor Drug
will be here; and you know we
shall
split
our
sides
laughing at the ninnies. You're
so
full of your jokes that I want you here.
Dear Major, don't be engaged; but come.

Wedneday
Morning.As read by the Captain.
SIR,
You will
instantly
do one of two things,
either
relinquish
your attention to
Miss
Muslin
, and be no more in her company;
or meet me this evening
precisely
at
six
o'clock, on the commons the back of the
Potter's-field, with a brace of
pistols
, and
a
second
, to take a
shot
. I
shall
have a
coffin ready, and a grave dug, for which
ever of us
shall
have
occasion
to make
use
of it.
Your humble
servant
,
Benjamin
Johnston
.
Major Teague O'Regan.
