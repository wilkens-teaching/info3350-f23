VOL. I. B
REDWOOD
CHAPTER
I.
A fine heroine, truly!
A Patagonian monster without a show of breeding.
Anon
.
On
the last day of June, in the
year , a small vessel, which
traversed
weekly the waters of Lake
Champlain
,
was seen slowly entering one of the
most beautiful bays of that most
beautiful
lake. A travelling carriage with
handsome equipments, a coachman in
livery and an outrider, were drawn up
on the shore, awaiting the approach of
the vessel. On the deck stood a group
of travellers for whom the equipage
was destined: a beautiful young woman,
and her attendant, a female slave, were
surveying it with pleased and equal
eagerness, while the father of the young
lady seemed quite absorbed in the
contemplation
of a scene which poetry and
painting have marked for their own.
Not a breeze stirred the waters; their
mirror surface was quite unbroken, save
where the little vessel traced its dimpled
pathway. A cluster of islands lay in
beautiful fraternity opposite the harbour,
covered with a rich growth of wood,
and looking young, and fresh, and
bright, as if they had just sprung from
the element on which they seemed to
repose. The western shore presented
every variety of form; wooded
headlands
jutting boldly into the lake, and
richly cultivated grounds sloping gently
to its margin. As the traveller's
delighted
eye explored still farther, it
B 2
rested on the mountains that rise in four
successive chains, one above the other,
the last in the far distance dimly
defining
and bounding the horizon. A cloud
at this moment veiled the face of the
sun, and its rich beams streamed aslant
upon the mountain tops, and poured
showers of gold and purple light into
the deep recesses of the valleys. Mr.
Redwood, a true admirer of nature's
lovely forms, turned his unsated gaze to
the village they were approaching,
which was indicated by a neat church
spire that peered over the hill, on the
height and declivities of which were
planted several new and neat
habitations
.
Oh Caroline, my child,
exclaimed
the father, was there ever
any thing more beautiful!
Never, certainly, to my eye, replied
the daughter; but I think a carriage far
less handsome than ours would look
beautiful, after those little ville calches,
and viler ponies, with which we made
our entree into Montreal. Oh, papa,
continued the young lady, too intent on
present pleasure and past mortification
to notice the shade of disappointment
that had chased away the animation of
her father's face; Oh, papa, I never
shall forget our odious little Canadian
driver, half Indian, half French, the
rose tucked into his button-hole, the
signal of one nation, and the wampum
belt of the other; and then his mongrel
dialect. Oh that `marse donc,' with
which he excruciated his poney and us
at the same moment, does it not yet
ring in your ears?
I cannot say that my recollections
are quite as lively as yours, Caroline,
rejoined Mr. Redwood.
You are such an old traveller, papa,
and besides you are always thinking of
something else; but it is quite a different
affair with me. My heavens! you had
no imagination of my misery from the
moment I entered the calche at la Chine,
until I was safely sheltered in my room
at the hotel: you sat rolling your eyes
around the green fields as if they were
all drawing-rooms, and every dew-drop
a diamond, while I would gladly have
drowned myself in the St. Lawrence!
Really, my dear, replied the father,
his tone bordering on contempt, I did
not suspect you of any such mad designs
on your own sweet personyou seemed
very quiet.
Quiet, yes indeed, quiet enough;
how could I help myself? but you must
own, papa, that it was excessively
mortifying
to make our entrance into the city
in such style. Grandmamma says that
people of fortune should never lay aside
the insignia of their rank.
Your grandmother's jumble of
fortune
and rank have a strong savor of
republican ignorance. I would advise
you, Miss Redwood, not to adopt her
wise axioms as rules for the conduct of
your life. And you really allowed
yourself
to suffer mortification on account of
entering the little city of Montreal, in
the best mode the country provides for
travellersa place too, where not a
creature knew you from any other
member
of the human family?
Ah, there Sir, you are quite
mistaken
;
for Captain Fenwick had written
to all the officers of his corps our
intention
of going to Montreal, and he told
me that he had described me so
particularly
to his friend Captain Fitzgerald,
that he was sure he would know me at a
single glance of his eye.
Then we are indebted to Captain
Fenwick for the honour of Fitzgerald's
civilities? I fancied our acquaintance
with him had been accidental. The
penetrating look with which Mr.
Redwood
finished his sentence, gave it an
interrogative meaning, and his daughter
feeling herself bound to reply, said,
rather sullenly, Our introduction was
purely accidental: you saw it, Sir, and I
thought at the time, seemed quite
grateful
that the timely aid of the Captain's
arm saved me from being run over.
I was and am grateful, my child, for
the aid which the gallant Captain's arm
afforded you; though it may be, that
stoic as I am, I measured my gratitude
rather by the danger than the alarm.
The frightened animal, as well as I
remember, turned into another street,
instead of passing by the way we were
going; but this is neither here nor there;
I merely expressed an innocent surprise,
that there should have been grounds for
your acquaintance with Captain
Fitzgerald
which you never intimated to me.
Lord, papa, it is so awkward to talk
to you about such matters; I am sure
I had no other objection to telling you
that Fitzgerald knew all about us before
he saw us.
All about
you
, Miss Redwood; for I
am quite a cypher in the eyes of such
men as the Captain, having no other value
than what results from being your
adjunct
.
Fitzgerald was then apprised
that you are a belle, and will be an
heiress?
Probably. And if I do possess the
advantage
of those distinctions, I am sure
I ought to be much indbeted to Captain
Fenwick for making them known, that
I may enjoy them abroad as well as at
home. Mr. Redwood thought the
distinctions
which procured for his
daughter
a host of such admirers as Fitzgerald
of very doubtful advantage, and would
perhaps have said so, but the vessel at
this moment touched the wharf, and the
bustle of disembarking put an end to
the conversation. The travellers having
arranged themselves in the carriage,
Mr. Redwood ordered the coachman to
drive to the village tavern, where he
said it was his intention to pass the
night. A short drive carried them to
the door of the village inn. The
landlord
was sitting on a bench before the
B 3
door, alternately reading a newspaper,
and haranguing half-a-dozen loiterers
on the great political topics that then
agitated the country: his own patriotic
politics were sufficiently indicated by
the bearings of his sign-board; on one
side of which was rudely sketched the
surrender of Burgoyne, and on the other,
an American eagle with his talons
triumphantly
planted on a British lion. It
cannot be pretended that the skill of
the artist had been adequate to
revealing
his design to the observation of the
passing traveller; or rather the design
of Major Jonathan Doolittle, whose
name stood in bold relief on one side,
under the shadow of the spread wing of
the eagle; and on the other under the
delineation of the victory, which,
according
to the major's own opinion, he had
been a distinguished instrument in
achieving. But any deficiency in the
skill of the artist was abundantly
supplied
by the valuable comment of the
major, whose memory or imagination
filled up the imperfect outline with every
particular of the glorious victory. The
carriage drew up to the door of the
valiant
publican, and in answer to Mr.
Redwood's inquiry for the landlord, the
major replied without doffing his hat or
changing his attitude, I am he, Sir, in
the room of a better. Mr. Redwood
then inquired, if he could obtain
accommodation
for the night. The major
replied
exchanging with his compatriots a
knowing wink, that he rather guessed
not: he did not lay out to entertain
people
from the old countries; his women
folks thought they took too much
waiting
on. Caroline whispered an
entreaty
to her father, to order the
coachman
to drive on; but Mr. Redwood,
without heeding her, said, you mistake
us, friend, we are your own country
people, just returning from a visit to
the British provinces, and as we have
our own servants, and shall not need
much waiting on, you will not perhaps
object to receiving us. The major's
reluctance was somewhat abated by
this information, and would probably
have been quite overcome, but for his
desire of keeping up his consequence in
the eyes of the by-standers, by showing
off his inherent dislike of an
unquestionable
gentleman. He said, they were
calculating to have a training the next
day, and the women folks had just put
the house to rights, and he rather
guessed, they would not choose to have
it disturbed, but it was according as
they could agree; and if, he added,
for the first time rising and advancing
towards Mr. Redwood, if the
gentleman
could make it an object to them to
take so much trouble, he would go in
and inquire.
This last interested stipulation of the
major filled up the measure of Mr.
Redwood's disgust; and turning
abruptly
from him to a good-natured
looking man, who, at that moment
riding past them on horseback, had
checked the career of his horse to gaze
at the travellers, he inquired the distance
to the next village. That, replied
the man, is according to which road
you take.
Is there any choice between the
roads?
It's rather my belief there is;
anyhow, there is many opinions held
about them. Squire Upton said, it was
shortest by his house, if you cut off the
bend by deacon Garson's; and General
Martin maintained, it was shortest
round the long quarter, so they got out
the surveyor and chained it. And
which road, interrupted Mr.
Redwood
,
proved the shortest?
Oh there was no proof about it;
the road is a bone of contention yet.
The surveyor was called off to hold a
Justice's court before he had finished
the squire's road, and
Which do you believe the shortest?
exclaimed Mr. Redwood, impatiently
cutting short the history of the
important
controversy.
Oh, I, replied the man, laughing,
and every body else but the squire,
calculate it to be the shortest way round
the long quarter, and the prospects are
altogether preferable that way, and that
is something of an object, as you seem
to be strangers in these parts.
Oh Lord, exclaimed Caroline,
it will soon be too dark for any
prospect
but that of breaking all our necks!
Do you think, pursued Mr.
Redwood
,
that we shall be able to arrive
before dark?
That's according as your horses are.
The horses are good and fleet.
Well then, Sir, it will depend
something
on the driver; but if you will
take my advice, you will stop by the
way. It is not far from night; there is
a pretty pokerish cloud rising; it is a
stretchy road to Eaton, and it will be
something risky for you to try to get
there by daylight. But, Sir, if you find
yourself crowded for time, and will stop
at my house, we will do our best to
make you comfortable for the night.
If you will put up with things being in
a plain farmer-like way, you shall be
kindly welcome.
Mr. Redwood thanked the good man
heartily for the proffer of his hospitality,
but declined it, saying, he doubted not
they should be able to reach the next
village before the storm. He then
directed
his coachman to drive on rapidly;
and exchanging a farewell nod with his
informant, who rode on briskly before
him, he sunk back into his seat, and
relapsed
into silence and abstraction.
Meanwhile, Caroline sat listening in
trepidation to the hoarse, though yet
distant threatenings of the thunder, and
watching with a restless eye the fearful
clouds that rolled darkly, volume over
volume, in their ascent to mid heaven.
For gracious sake put your head out
of the coach, Lilly, said she to her
servant, and look if there is any sign
of the village. Lilly could just discern
the spire of a church that stood on a
distant hill. On a hill of course,
replied
Caroline; one would think these
Yankees had contrived their churches
for telegraphs. I am delighted at any
rate, that there is a landmark in sight.
For heaven's sake, papa, she added,
impetuously turning to her father, do
rouse yourself, and look at those clouds.
I have been looking, my child, for
the last half hour, watching the fading
away of the bright tints from the edges
of that beautiful mass of clouds, and
thinking them a fit emblem of human
life. Thus we gaze upon the brilliant
vapour
,
and are dazzled with its changeful
hues, till the storm bursts in fury on our
heads. Hark, Caroline, how the wind
sighs through the branches of the trees:
does it not seem as if nature thus
expressed
her dread of the violence that is
about to be done to her beautiful face?
Oh, what does master mean,
inquired
Lilly; does he think our faces
will be struck with the lightning?
Heaven only knows what your
master
means. Do, papa, tell Ralph to
drive faster, the darkness is horrible.
Mr. Redwood soon felt that his
daughter's
terrors were not groundless. The
clouds had gathered a portentous
blackness
,
strong gales of wind were rushing
over the lake, the rain already poured
in torrents, and there were only such
intervals
between the lightning as served
to contrast the vivid flashes with the
thick darkness; the thunder burst in
loud explosions over their heads, and its
fearful peals were prolonged and
reverberated
by the surrounding hills. The
horses became restive, and the coachman
called to his master for permission to
stop at the next habitation. This was
readily granted, and the coachman
reined
his horses into a road that led off the
highway, over a little knoll to a farm
house which stood on a small eminence
at the right. Some rocks, a few feet in
height, served as an embankment to the
read on the left. The coachman cracked
his whip, and the horses were pressing
on at their utmost speed, when a
thunder-bolt
struck an enormous dead tree a
little in advance of them, fired its driest
branches, descended the trunk of the
tree, and tearing to splinters the parts
it touched, laid the roots bare, and
passed
off across the road. The horses
terrified by the excessive vividness of the
lightning, or the flaming tree, or perhaps
both, sprang to the left, and before the
coachman, scarcely less terrified than
they, had made an effort to control their
movements, they had dashed over the
rocks, and forced the carriage after
them. The horses sprang through a
clump of young walnuts that grew at
the base of the rocks. Most happily the
carriage was too wide for the passage,
and the axles of the wheels were caught
by the trees: the sudden check given to
the velocity of the motion of the
carriage
broke the traces, and the released
horses bounded away, leaving it and its
inmates in perfect safety.
The moment Mr. Redwood perceived
the horses would inevitably descend the
rocks, he had instinctively opened the
carriage door and sprung out: he fell
against the trunk of a tree, and when he
attempted to rise to move to his
daughter's
relief, he felt himself disabled, and
sunk back insensible. Fortunately the
coachman, quite unharmed, flew to the
aid of the mistress and maid, who were
both shrieking in the carriage. Oh,
stop the horses, stop the horses! cried
Caroline.
The horses, Miss Caroline, are gone.
Gone; but oh, Raphy, won't they come
back again?
Upon Ralph's repeated assurances
that there was not the slightest danger
of, or from such a circumstance, Caroline
alighted, and found to her surprise, life
and limb unscathed. When she had
quite satisfactorily ascertained this fact,
she turned to look for her father, but
when she saw him stretched on the grass
the image of death, she shrunk back
appalled
.
At this moment she heard some
persons approaching to their assistance;
they were from the neighbouring
farm-house
,
and had been alarmed by her
shrieks which they had heard even amid
the wild war of earth and heaven.
Make the best of your way, miss, to the
house, said one of the men kindly, we
will bring the gentleman in our arms.
Caroline followed the direction, and
was met at the door by several females,
who clustered about her with
expressions
of pity, and offers of assistance.
She moved past them all, and throwing
herself into a chair, vented her feelings
in loud hysterical sobbings; while Lilly
set up a most doleful cry of Oh, what
will become of us, master is killed, and
the horses are gone! The mistress of
the house with a voice of authority
commander
her to be still; and at this
moment
the men entered, bearing in Mr.
Redwood, pale as death, but sensible and
calm. Thank God you are not hurt,
my child, he said, on seeing Caroline,
and I am better. The door of a spare
room being now thrown open, the bed
uncovered, the pillows shaken up, the
mistress of the house pointed to the men
to deposit their burthen there. Caroline
and her servant followed Mr. Redwood;
but so much were they both terrified by
his paleness, and the distortion of his
face from the extreme pain he endured,
that they were incapable of offering him
any assistance. Not so the good matron
and her young hand-maidens. It seemed
to be their vocation to act; and so
efficient
were they in their prompt
ministration
of camphor and cordials, that he
was soon in a state fully to understand
his condition and wants. He said to his
daughter that it would be necessary for
him to remain where he was for the
present, to summon a physician
immediately
,
to ascertain the injury he had
sustained, and to set his arm if the bones
were, as he apprehended, displaced;
against this the daughter warmly
remonstrated
.
His host, having overheard a part of the
debate, which was conducted in an under
tone, said he would call Debby.
Debby
,
he said, was as skilful as the run
of doctors; she was a nat'ral bone
setter
;
at any rate, if the gentleman was
not willing to trust himself in her hands,
she could tell if there were any broken
bones. Debby was summoned, and
soon made her appearance, muttering
something about the boys, boy fashion,
having left out the old mare, and she
guessed she felt as much pain with her
broken leg, as your quality. She,
however
,
seemed a little softened at the sight
of Mr. Redwood, who was evidently
suffering acute pain, and what probably
interested Debby more, bearing it
manfully
.
Not, she continued, that I
would put a beast's life against a man's;
but she is a good creature, and a
sarviceable
,
and it is a shame for the boys to
neglect her because she grows a little
old and unsightly. The boys, as she
denominated two full grown young
men, who stood at the foot of the bed,
exchanged smiles, as if they were too
much inured to this privileged railer to
heed her reproaches. Mr. Redwood
shrunk from her touch as she approached
him; but without noticing his alarm,
she thrust her hand into an enormous
pocket, which hung on one side of her
gaunt person, and extricating from its
miscellaneous contents a large pair of
scissors, (which one would have thought
stood as little chance of being found as
a needle in a hay-mow,) she cut open
the sleeve of the coat with more care
and adroitness than could have been
expected
from such an operator, and then
unceremoniously tearing down the shirt
sleeve, she proceeded to the examination
of the arm, which she pronounced a bad
business. The shoulder she said was out
of joint, and a breakage into the
bargain
:
and do you, James, said she,
turning to one of the young men,
mount Rover, and go for Doctor Bristol,
and tell him to come as fast as horse-flesh
can bring him, for it an't all nature can
set this arm after to-night. And James,
child, she added, be careful when
you take Rover out of the stable, not
to hit the old mare; for beasts have
feelings too.
There had been such promptness in
Miss Debby's proceedings, and the
family was obviously so much in the
habit of obeying her orders, that Mr.
Redwood had not as yet been able to
interpose a question; but as James
turned to execute Debby's order, he
said, stop, young man; before you go
I should like to know who this Dr.
Bristol is, and to ascertain his ability to
perform a delicate operation; and I
must know from you, my friend, he
continued, turning to the master of the
house, (whom he had just recognised to
be the same person who had so kindly
invited him to accept a shelter beneath
his roof,) whether you can
accommodate
my daughter and myself, while we
may be detained by this unlucky
accident
?
Mr. and Mrs. Lenox (the farmer and
his wife,) were eagerly beginning to
proffer their hospitality, with the
courtesy
of genuine kindness, when Debby
interrupted them, with saying, go
along, James, is this no time to stand
upon compliments, go like the wind, a
miss is as good as a mile.
James obeyed; and Mr. Lenox said,
VOL. I. C
I believe you may trust Dr. Bristol, Sir;
he doctors all the country round, and in
all curable cases, under Providence, he
cures. He studied under Rush, and has
but few equals in these parts.
No, no, said Debby, nor in any
other parts: he is a real likely man, and
they a'n't much thicker any where than
swallows in January. But,
interposed
Mr. Lenox, as the gentleman is
a stranger among us, it is natural, and
very right that he should be
mistrustful
.
Oh, quite right, replied Debby,
and rational; and I like him all the
better for it; none but your parfect fools
believe in any thing and every body.
But it is, she continued, with the
got
of an amateur in the matter, it is a real
pleasure to see Dr. Bristol set bones; it
is beautiful. There was Tom Russel,
fool and mad-cap that he was, and
bating
his being a human creature, better
dead than alive, that fell off from the
steeple of our meeting-house; there was
scarce a whole bone left in his body;
and when the doctor first overhauled
him, he looked dumb-foundered, for he
is tender-hearted for all being a doctor
I spirited him up, and he went to work,
and a quicker, neater piece of work,
never has been done since the days of
miracles: the bones went snap, crack,
like the guns of our militia boys; not
quite so loud may-be, but full as reg'lar.
God Grant, exclaimed Mr.
Redwood
,
(who had been writhing under
Debby's story,) that your doctor may
not have lost his gifts, nor his skill.
No, replied Debby, a wise man
a'n't apt to lose either. Mr. Redwood
felt a natural apprehension, lest he
should not be able to obtain the aid of
this physician, whose skill seemed to
have inspired such confidence, and he
inquired of Mr. Lenox, if he thought it
probable the messenger would find him
at home. Almost certain, replied
C 2
Mr. Lenox, he was here yesterday to
pay his last visit to a young man who
has been a long time sick, poor fellow:
he died last evening. A consolatory
proof of your doctor's skill, murmured
Mr. Redwood.
Half-a-dozen mouths were opened at
once to explain the doctor's failure.
Deborah's shrill tones prevailed over
every other voice; our days are all
numbered, man, she said, and to all
there comes a sickness that neither
doctors
nor doctor's-trade can cure; and
besides, as to in'ard diseases, there's
none but your pretensioners that profess
to understand them at all times.
And poor Edward, interposed
Mr. Lenox, died, I believe, of that
which you may well call an inward
disease
,
for which there is no help in this
world, a broken heart. As much that
as any thing, said Debby; at least
that might be called the 'casion of it all;
and it is far easier, she continued,
looking
at Mr. Redwood, mending broken
bones than broken hearts.
And far easier breaking bones than
hearts, replied Mr. Redwood.
That, said the indefatigable
Deborah, depends something upon
what the heart is made of. Some
hearts are tough as a bull's hide; you
might as well break a rock with
sun-beams
as break them with such troubles
as snapped the chord of poor Eddy, a
weakly narvous feeling creature. Mr.
Redwood, was suffering too severely to
indulge any curiosity in relation to
Eddy. All parties became silent, and
remained so until the arrival of the
physician, save the occasional
interruption
of a groan from the stranger, or an
expression of sympathy from some one
of the group that surrounded his bed.
We may profitably fill this interval
with a description of the various persons
that the occasion had assembled. And
first, as most conspicuous, the stranger,
mutilated as he was, appeared a finely
formed and graceful man, with a certain
air of gentility and high-breeding,
which even an unpractised eye may
detect in the most unfavourable
circumstances
.
He was rather above the
ordinary
height, and extremely thin. His
high forehead, from which the hair had
receded; the hair itself,
Jet black save where some touch of gray
Had ta'en the youthful hue away;
and the deep furrow in his cheeks,
indicated
that sorrow in some of its Proteus
shapes, had accelerated the work of time;
that the fruit which youth had promised,
had been blastednot ripened. His
face was a history; but there were few
that possessed the key by which the
settled gloom of his pallid brow, and
the melancholy of his fine hazle eye
might have been interpreted. The
figure of Deborah supporting the
elegant
traveller, looked like the
rough-hewn
stone beside the exquisitely
polished
statue on which the sculptor has
expended
all his art.
Miss Debby's person, mind, and
history
,
were altogether singular. Her
height was rather above the grenadier
standard, as she exceeded by one inch
six feet; her stature and her
weatherbeaten
skin would have led one to
suspect
that her feminine dress was a vain
attempt at disguise, had not her voice,
which possessed the shrillness which is
the peculiar attribute of a woman's,
testified
to Miss Debby's right to make
pretensions which at the first glance
seemed monstrous; her quick grey eye,
shaded by huge, bushy eye-brows,
indicated
sagacity and thought; time, or
accident, had made such ravages on her
teeth, that but a very few remained,
and they stood like hardy veterans who
have by dint of superior strength
survived
their contemporaries.
As Debby would not voluntarily
encumber herself with any toilette
duties that could in decency be dispensed
with, she had never put any covering on
her hair, which time had now considerably
grisled; but she wore it confined in one
long braid, and so closely bound with a
black ribbon, that it did not require, in
her judgment, more than a weekly
adjustment. The only relict of worldly
or womanly vanity which Debby
displayed
,
was a string of gold beads,
which according to a tradition that had
been carefully transmitted to the younger
members of the family, had been given
to their Aunt Debby some thirty years
before by a veteran soldier, who, at the
close of our revolutionary war, was
captivated
by the martial air of this then
young Amazon.
But Debby was so imbued with the
independent spirit of the times, that she
would not then consent to the surrender
of any of her rights: and there was no
tradition in the family that her maidenly
pride had suffered a second solicitation.
The careful preservation of the beads,
and a certain kindliness and
protecting
air towards all mankind, indicated
ever after a grateful recollection of her
lover. On the whole, there was in
Deborah's face, rough and ungainly as
it was, an expression of benevolence
that humanized its hard features, and
affected one like the sun-beams on a
frosty November day. She was an
elder sister of Mr. Lenox; had always
resided with his family; and was treated
with deference by all its amiable
members
.
Mr. Lenox, as master of the family,
was entitled to precedence in our
description
;
but in this instance, as in many
others, a prominent character has
controlled
the arrangement of accidental
circumstances. He belonged to the mass
of New-England farmers, was
industrious
and frugal, sober and temperate,
and enjoyed the reward of those staple
C 3
virtues, good health and a competency.
He was rather distinguished for the
passive than the active virtues, patient
and contented; he either enjoyed with
tranquillity, or resigned without repining.
His wife (we believe not a singular case
in matrimonial history,) was his
superior
:
intelligent, well-informed,
enterprising
,
and efficient, she was accounted
by all her neighbours an
ambitious
woman
.
The lofty may smile with
contempt
,
that the equivocal virtue, which
is appropriated to the Csars and the
Napoleons, should be so much as
mentioned
in the low vales of humble life.
But the reasonable will not dispute that
Mrs. Lenox made ambition virtue,
when they learn that all her aspirations
after distinction were limited to the
appropriate
duties of her station. Her
husband and sons wore the finest cloth
that was manufactured in the county
of . Mrs. Lenox's table was
covered
with the handsomest and the
whitest diaper. Her butter and cheese
commanded the highest price in the
market. Besides these home-bread
virtues
,
she possessed the almost universal
passion of her country for intellectual
pleasures. She read with avidity herself,
and eagerly seized every opportunity
for the improvement of her children.
She had married very young, and was
still in the prime of life. The elder
members of her family were already
educated and established in the world;
and she had the prospect of enjoying
what Franklin reckons among the
benefits
of our early marriages, an
afternoon
and evening of cheerful leisure.
Her eldest son, with very little aid from
his parents, had, by his own virtuous
exertions, obtained a collegiate and
theological education, and was
established
a popular clergyman in one of
the southern cities. Her second son
had emigrated to Ohio, and had already
transmitted to his parents a drawing
and description of a prosperous little
town, where, five years before, his axe
had first announced man's right to
dominion
over the forest. Two sons
remained
at home to labour on the
paternal
farm; and four girls, from ten to
eighteen, diligent, good-humoured, and
intelligent, completed the circle of the
domestic felicities of this happy family.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Lenox had the wise
and dutiful habit, which, in almost any
condition, might generate contentment,
of looking at their own possessions, to
awaken their gratitude, rather than by
comparing the superior advantages of
others with their meaner possessions, to
dash their own cup with the venom of
discontent and envy, a few drops of
which will poison the sweetest draught
ever prepared by a paternal Providence,
On the kindness of this family Mr.
Redwood and his daughter were cast
for the present; and proud and
powerful
in the possession of rank and fortune,
Miss Redwood was obliged to learn
the humiliating truth, that no human
creature can command independence.
Mr. Redwood had been all his life a
traveller, and was a man of the world.
He comprehended at once the
embarrassments
of his situation, and
gracefully
accommodated himself to the
inconveniences
of it, and in such a way,
as to conciliate the favour of the
goodhearted
people about him. How far his
daughter imitated his wise example, the
following pages will show.
CHAPTER II.
A country doctor, said Touchwood sneeringly; you
will never be able to make any thing of him.
The Cynic
.
Before
the return of James Lenox
with the physician, Mr. Redwood had
made an arrangement with Mr. Lenox,
who consented to consider the strangers
as boarders while Mr. Redwood's
accident
should detain him at the place we
shall call Eton. Some little bustle in
the entry announced the arrival of the
physician, and he entered the
apartment
followed by Caroline, who with
more alarm than she had testified before,
advanced hastily to her father, and said
in a tone which, though a little depressed,
was still overheard by all the
by-standers
My
dear father, you surely will
not suffer yourself to be murdered by a
country doctor; pray, pray, remember
poor Rose.
Your grand mother' slap-dog? do not
be a simpleton, Caroline.
I do not see, replied Caroline,
still in a tone of eager expostulation,
how Rose, being a dog, alters the case.
I am sure grandmamma thought as much
of her as of any friend she had in the
world. May not, she added, turning
to the physician, may not my father
wait till a surgeon can be obtained from
Boston or New York?
Undoubtedly he may, replied the
doctor, smiling.
And without danger? inquired
Mr. Redwood, who seemed to have
become
infected with his daughter's
apprehensions
.
Possibly without danger, replied
the physician, though I should
apprehend
not without great additional
suffering
.
Better to suffer than to die, urged
Caroline.
I trust your father is not reduced
to that alternative, replied the
physician
.
Such accidents are
inconvenient
,
but seldom fatal. Shall I, Sir, he
added, turning to Mr. Redwood,
proceed
to the examination of your arm?
The modest demeanour and manly
promptness of the doctor inspired his
patient with confidence; and ashamed
of having for a moment yielded to the
weakness of his daughter, he said,
proceed
,
Sir, certainly. Forgive my
daughter's
scruplesshe is alarmed and
inexperienced
.
She is a dumb fool, muttered
Debby; and laying her arm on
Caroline's
,
with a force to compel
obedience
,
she pushed her out of the room,
and then with an absolute command,
dispersing all but those whose assistance
was required, she prepared to obey the
orders of docter Bristol, to whom she
evidently deferred as to a master
operator
.
The physician in his turn treated her
as a confidential agent; and so quietly,
skilfully, and expeditiously did he
perform
the operation, that he fully
substantiated
in the judgment of his
grateful patient, all the praise that had
been lavished on him. Mr. Redwood
bore the operation with stoical firmness,
but after it was over his strength seemed
much exhausted.
His physician ordered that he should
be kept perfectly quiet, and that no one
should have access to the room but those
whose services were necessary. He
inquired
of Mr. Redwood if he preferred
that his daughter should stay with him.
Mr. Redwood sighing deeply, replied,
that his daughter was too much
unaccustomed
to scenes of this kind to be of
any use to him; and the physician
proceeded
to make arrangements with Mrs.
Lenox and Deborah. The result of their
deliberations was, that Deborah should
keep this night's vigil at the bed of the
sick man.
These important arrangements being
made, doctor Bristol undertook to
inform
Miss Redwood of her father's
amended condition. She received the
intelligence with less animation than
might have been reasonably anticipated
from the apprehensions she had
expressed
.
She was glad, she said, it
was all over, for she was tired to death
and wished to go to her room.
Yes, said her officious domestic,
you are tired, Miss Cary, you look
very sick, as pale as a ghost.
Oh Lilly, exclaimed Caroline,
that is impossible, for I never lose my
colour, you know; and she ran briskly
to a looking-glass, which, shrouded in
gauze, and bedecked with festoons of
ground-pine adorned Mrs. Lenox's neat
parlour. The mirror was imperfect,
and it sent back as distorted a
resemblance
of the disappointed beauty, as if
spleen and envy had reflected the image.
Oh Lord! Lord! she exclaimed, it
would be the death of me to see myself
again in that odious glass.
I hope not, said doctor Bristol.
We have specifics for such diseases in
this retirement, where there are few to
admire, and none to flatter.
Are all your specifics,
caustics
,
doctor?
Oh, no! replied the doctor, smiling
very pleasantly, (for it cannot be denied
that his instinctive indignation at Miss
Redwood's insensibility was softened
by her matchless beauty;) no, we
prescribe caustics for inveterate diseases
only: for the young and susceptible
we have gentler remedies.
And your cure for vanity is
Abstinenceor, a low diet often
subdues the violence of the symptoms
the disease is of the chronic order, seldom
cured. But do not imagine that I
have the presumption to prescribe for
you, Miss Redwood, ignorant as I am
even of the existence of the malady.
Your prescription, Sir, would at any
rate be quite superfluous, replied
Caroline
,
arranging while she spoke, with
evident satisfaction, her dark glossy
curls before the mirror of her
dressing-case
,
which Lilly (with the true instinct
of a lady's maid,) had placed before her
mistress; vanity will die of starvation
in this solitude.
Oh my dear young lady, you are
ignorant of the disease, rejoined the
doctor; there is no element in which
it cannot live, and thrive, and find food
convenient for it. I am not much
skilled
in the history of classic gentry; but
if I remember right, it was not the
flatteries of a court or a multitude that
cost poor Narcissus his life, but a rustic
truth-telling woodland stream: depend
on it, Miss Redwood, the danger is
within; and `inward diseases,' as my
friend Debby calls them, are apt to
baffle the most skilful.
That being so, Sir, retorted Miss
Redwood, it may be well to reserve
your skill for obvious diseases and real
dangers. She then proceeded to
inquire
with considerable interest, into the
particulars of her father's injury; and
concluded by asking how long they
should be detained at Eton.
It is impossible to say, replied the
doctor; five or six weeks, perhaps
longer. Your father's recovery must
depend somewhat on his previous health
and stock of spirits.
Oh, then it is a desperate case, for
he has been on the verge of
consumption
for these two years; and as to his
spirits, heaven only knows when he had
any. He has been as dull as death ever
since I remember him.
Very unfavourable, replied the
doctor, shaking his head; but a
parent's melancholy must be obstinate
indeed to resist the cheering efforts of a
child; and I trust, Miss Redwood, your
resolution and patience will be equal to
the present demand on them.
It is a demand I cannot answer, Sir.
I might as well call spirits from the
vasty deep, as summon mine at
pleasure
.
Grandmamma always said
cheerfulness
was a virtue that belonged to
common peoplequite necessary for
them. I am never melancholy,
however
.
Melancholy only suits the old
and unfortunate; and if I must remain
here, I will try not to hang myself.
A virtuous resolution, truly.
Doctor, exclaimed Caroline, after
a few moments pause, is there nothing
going on here; nothing to keep one
alive?
Yes, replied the doctor, drily,
from this very house there is to be a
funeral to-morrow.
Quite a diverting circumstance,
rejoined Caroline. Pray, Sir, who is
it that is to be buried? No one of any
consequence of course.
Goodness is the only consequence
that we acknowledge, replied the
doctor
,
gravely; and our young friend's
escutcheon has no blot upon it.
Caroline seemed mortified, and did
not pursue her inquiries, and the
physician
took his leave after having
repeated
his orders that the invalid should
be kept as quiet as possible till his return
in the morning.
Miss Redwood was shown into a
small but very neat apartment, in which
were two beds; one of them had just
been arranged for her accommodation.
This bed is for me, is it? she enquired
turning to a little girl who was her
conductor
,
and at the same moment
negligently
throwing down her hat on a
neatly spread quilt, as white as snow.
`,Yes, miss, that is yours, replied
the child.
And the other is my servant's?
Oh no, miss, that is Ellen's!
Well, you little thing, what is
your name?
Lucy, replied the child, dropping
a courtesy.
Well, Lucy, ask your mother to
order
a bed to be made for my servant here.
I can ask her, replied the child;
but, she added in a lower tone as she
was leaving the room, I guess she
won't find it convenient to put that
black girl into Ellen's room.
Lucy, however, notwithstanding her
prediction, returned in a few moments
to say that Miss Redwood's request was
granted; and you may thank Ellen
for it, she added, for mother would
not hear to it till Ellen begged her.
Well, well, child, you may go now
it is all very well. I shall take care to
compensate your mother, and this Ellen
too, for any favours they may grant me.
Lilly, she added, turning to her servant
undress me, and make over that bed,
it is not likely these people know how to
make a bed. Pin down the undersheet
all around as grandmamma has hers; I
feel fidgetty to-night, and a wrinkle
would disturb meheigho! how long is
it since we left Montreal, Lilly?
Two days, Miss Cary.
Two days! what an age it seems:
two days since I parted from the divine
Fitzgerald, and it will be twice that
number
of weeks before I see another civilized
being. That old jade that told my
fortune
,
coming down the lake, was not so
much out when she said I should meet
with losses and crosses; but who could
have dreamed of such a cross as this?
And then to think that the Crayton's
will get to Boston before us; and Maria
will contrive to show off her French
dresses first. Oh, it is too provoking!
For heaven's sake, Lilly, stow away my
VOL. I. D
trunk out of my sight, it will make me
wretched to see those beautiful dresses,
of Le Moine's all lying idle, getting
yellow, and old-fashioned. Thus Miss
Redwood continued to run on, half to
her servant and half to herself, till she
lost in sleep the consciousness of her
disappointments
.
CHAPTER III.
Fleecy locks and black complexion
Cannot forfeit nature's claim;
Skins may differ, but affection
Dwells in white and black the same.
Cowper
.
Henry Redwood
was a native of
Virginia, that State of the Union where
the patrician rank has escaped in the
greatest degree, the levelling principle
of republicanism. His father was a rich
planter: adhering pertinaciously to the
custom of his predecessors, he
determined
that his eldest son should inherit
his large landed property. To Henry
he gave a good education, and designed
that he should resort to the usual
expedient
of unportioned gentility,
compensating
D 2
by his marriage for the defects of
his inheritance. He was early destined
to be the husband of Maria Manning,
the only daughter of Mr. Redwood's
sister, a rich widow who resided in
Charleston, South-Carolina.
Henry Redwood had originally a
highly gifted mind, and strong
affections
;
under happy influences he might
have become the benefactor of his
country
,
its ornament and blessing; or he
might in domestic life have illustrated
the virtues that are appropriate to its
quiet paths. His father trained his
eldest
son in his own habits, which were
those of an English country squire.
Henry was left to follow the bent of his
own inclinations, and possessing a less
robust constitution than his brother, and
a contemplative turn of mind, he
preferred
sedentary to active pursuits. He
early manifested a decided taste for
literature; he felt the beauty, and
confessed
the power of the moral sublime;
he loved the virtues that illustrate the
pages of the moralist, and he
sympathized
with the examples of heroism
which the poet and the historian have
rescued from the ashes of past ages.
But unhappily he saw few
resemblances
in life to these fair portraits.
His father's character was of the coarsest
texture; his life when not devoted to
the gaming table, the excitements of
the race-ground, or the stimulating
pleasures of the chase, was wasted in
the most perfect indolence at home: his
mother had been a beauty, and possessed
many of the gentle qualities of her sex,
but, unresisting and timid in her nature,
she had fallen into such habits of
unqualified
submission to her husband, that
she had no longer courage to assert the
rights of virtue, or power to impress
them on her children. Young
Redwood
had one friend, the son of a
neighbouring
planter, whom he called his
good genius, and his elevated character
and rare purity entitled him to this
distinction
.
The influence of his virtues
and affection might, perhaps, have
preserved
Henry from the errors of his
after life, but their opportunities of
intercourse
were rare and brief, in
consequence
of a political animosity between
their parents; and before Henry had
received impressions deep enough to
mature into principle the strong
inspirations
of feeling, he was sent to
college
;
there, by one of those unlucky
chances that sometimes give a colour to
the destiny of life, he was led, first to
an acquaintance, and subsequently to an
intimacy, with an unprincipled man, by
the name of Alsop. This man possessed
plausible talents and insinuating
manners
;
but his mind had been
contaminated
by the infidelity fashionable at
that period, and his vanity was
stimulated
by the hope of adding to his
little band of converts a young man of
Redwood's acknowledged genius.
The unfeeling and audacious wit of
Voltaire, the subtle arguments of Hume,
and all that reckless and busy infidelity
has imagined and invented, were arrayed
by this skilful champion against the
accidental faith of Henry Redwood:
for that faith may surely be called
accidental
which knows no reason for its
existence, but is the result of being born
in a christian community, and of an
occasional attendance at church. The
triumph was an easy one. Redwood's
vision, like that of other unbelievers,
was dazzled by the ignus fatuus that his
own vanity had kindled; and like them,
he flattered himself, that he was making
great discoveries, because he had turned
from the road which was travelled by
the vulgar throng.
In the free and even licentious
speculation
of the closet, young Redwood,
was not surpassed by any of his new
intimates; but he had a purity and
refinement of taste, which, though it
would not have opposed an effectual
barrier to strong temptation, deterred
him from associating himself with them
in their gross and profligate pleasures.
He was sometimes disgusted, but
never shocked by their profligacy. He
maintained that whatever a man called
good was good to him; and that,
released
from the thraldom of fearing a
visionary future, he was at liberty to
disengage himself from the galling
fetters which virtue and religion impose,
and to expatiate without apprehension
or compunction in a religion of perfect
liberty. A little reflection, and a very
short experience taught him, that these
principles would dissolve society, and
then like some other philosophers, he
adopted expediency for his rule of right.
He found it to be impossible so suddenly
to emancipate men from the slavery of
prejudice; some hundred years must
pass away before the downfall of the
prevailing systems of superstition. The
enlightened must submit, while the
ignorant are the majority; and a man's
conduct must be graduated by the
standard of the community in which
he lived.
Opinion was the rule, and ignorance
the presiding deity, in this new creed.
Still Henry Redwood's reason was not
quite obscured, nor his heart quite
depraved. He often turned from the
heartless pages of infidelity to the
inspiration of virtue, and found that
while the first controlled his judgment,
the latter could alone sway his affections.
A virtuous action would send an
involuntary
glow to his cheek, and make
him wish he had never doubted the
reality of the principle that produced it.
Redwood was ambitious; and after
having won the first literary honours of
his college, he returned to his family
elated with his success, and proud of his
superiority. He again met the friend
of his youth Edmund Westall, who,
during
D 3
their separation had become a
married
man; and in whose family
Redwood
found irresistible attractions.
Westall was a few years older than
Redwood; and there was an authority
in his example that could not well be
evaded, and a persuasion in his goodness
that touched Redwood's heart. He felt
it like an excrcism that conjured out of
him every evil spirit.
But the state of his own mind will be
best shown by a letter which he wrote
at this time to his infidel friend.
Some months have elapsed, dear
Alsop, since we parted, and parted with
a truly juvenile promise to keep up
an unremitting epistolary intercourse.
And this I believe is the first essay made
by either of us; a fair illustration of the
common proportion which performance
bears to such promises. You, no doubt,
have been roving from pleasure to
pleasure
,
with an untiring impulse, and your
appetite, like the horse-leech, has still
cried, `give, give.' If one of your
vagrant thoughts has strayed after me,
you have doubtless fancied me immured
in my study, pursuing my free inquiries,
abandoning the fallen systems of vulgar
invention, and soaring far over the
misty atmosphere of imposture and
credulity
.
Or, perhaps, you deem that I
have adopted your sapient advice, have
returned to my home a dutiful child,
gracefully worn the chains of filial
obedience
,
made my best bow to papa, and
with a, `just as you please, Sir,' fallen,
secundum artem, desperately in love
with my beautiful, and beautifully rich
cousin; have rather taken than asked
her willing hand, and thus opened for
myself the path of ambition, or the
golden gates that lead to the regions of
pleasure, and which none but fortune's
hand can open, But, alas! the most
reasonable hopes are disappointed by
our fantastic destiny. We are the sport
of chance; and as we confess no other
deity, you are bound not to deride any
of the whimsical dilemmas into which
his votaries are led. Alsop, you have
often commended the boldness of my
mind, while you laughed at a certain
involuntary homage I paid to the
beautiful
pictures of goodness, which some
dreaming enthusiasts have presented to
us, or to the moral beauty which among
all the varieties of accidental
combination
,
is sometimes exhibited in real
life.
Have I prepared you to hear the
confession that I am at this present
moment the blind and willing dupe of
goodness, (I mean what the moralists
call goodness,) embodied in a form that
might soften a stoic, convert an infidel,
or perform any other miracle.
You have heard me make
honourable
mention of my friend Westall.
He is by some years my elder, three or
four at least. I think I never related
the circumstances of our introduction
to each other; I am quite certain I did
not, for you would have laughed at
them; they may now serve to elucidate
to you my friend's character, and to
account for our early and reciprocal
interest.
My father had among his servants
a native African; one of those men
whom nature has endowed with a giant
frame, and correspondent qualities of
mind. At the time my father purchased
him, he was separated from his wife
and two children, girls; the only boy
my father purchased with him, whether
because he thought the presence of the
child would help to keep the father in
heart, or from a transient feeling of
compassion for the poor wretch, I know
not. The wife had suffered deplorably
from the voyage, and was knocked
down with her two girls to a Georgian
for a trifle. You do not know my
father: suffice it to say, that selfishness
and habit have made him quite insensible
to the sufferings of these poor devils,
whom he classes with other brutes born
for our service. But there was
something
extraordinary in the strong
affections
and unconquerable temper of this
man. His wife and little ones were
torn from his strong grasp, and when
resistance was hopeless, and he turned
from them, the large muscles of his
neck swelled almost to bursting, and
he set up a desperate howl, that made
every heart quake or melt. Some one
of the throng around him, put his boy
into his arms: the sight of him changed
the current of his feelings; he soon
became silent, and, a few moments after,
his tears fell thick and heavy on the
child. My father brought him home.
He performed his appointed tasks well,
but he was retired and sulky, and the
smallest services that were imposed on
his child seemed to exasperate his spirit.
It was not many months after he came
into our possession, that our overseer,
a cruel worthless dog, beat the child
who had unwarily offended him,
unmercifully
.
The father interposed and
rescued
the child at the expense of some
cutting lashes on his own back, which
he seemed to regard no more than the
idle wind. The very night after, the
child disappeared, and it was believed
the unhappy father had put an end to
the boy's life. The fact was never
ascertained, though no one doubted it;
for as you will readily believe my
father was not very zealous to establish
a truth which would have deprived him
of one of his most valuable slaves. These
circumstances transpired before I was
old enough to remember them; but
when I first heard the report of them
among our domestic annals, I felt an
involuntary respect for this man, who
with a spirit more noble than Cato's,
cut the cord that bound his son to
captivity
,
and manfully continued to
endure the galling of his own chains.
Was not this a glorious illustration of
the truth of our old friend Seneca's
remark, that `sometimes to live is
magnanimity?'
Time passed on, but Africk (for
that was the name my father had given
him,) remained unaltered. I think I
see him now, going to his daily task,
always apart from the herd, and quite
alone; his firm and slow step, the
curling
of his lip, which would have better
become a monarch than a slave, and his
fixed downcast eye.
His mind, which like adamant had
resisted the influence of time, was at last
subdued by fanaticism, which you know,
like some chemical powers, will dissolve
substances that no chemical force can
impress. My father (a little alarmed
himself, as I suspect, by an eloquent
harangue,) permitted a zealous
Methodist
or Moravian, I am not certain which,
but a member of one of these tribes of
amiable madmen, to address his people.
A great sensation was produced, and
among the rest, Africk eagerly seized
every opportunity of communication
with the preacher. He had never
before
sought human communion or
sympathy
.
He soon became a convert; his
fierce manner was changed to
gentleness
;
he no longer avoided his fellows;
and though still reserved and silent, it
seemed to me that his religion brought
him back to the human family, and by
uniting him to the common Father of
all, restored the broken links of
fraternity
.
Whether his faith had an enfeebling
influence on his body as well as his
mind, I know not; but his health fell
into decay. The overseer complained
that he kept long vigils after his daily
labour; that he spent the nights which
were made to prepare him for his labour,
in prayers that exhausted his spirits and
his strength. My father inquired of
Buckley if he had used the whip; the
wretch replied, that he never entered a
complaint till that remedy had failed,
It did no more good, he said, to whip
him, than to beat the air; he bore it
without complaint, and without
shrinking
.
My father then recommended an
abatement of Africk's daily food.
That, Buckley said, he had tried
till the rascal was so weak he could
scarcely stand. I was present at this
conference, and my nature rebelled
against the intolerable oppression the
poor wretch was suffering. I
interposed
,
and entreated my father to adopt
kind treatment.
He swore at my boyish
impertinence
,
as he called it; but it was not,
however, without effect, for he
recommended
to Buckley milder usage. But
the fellow's habits of cruelty were too
firmly fixed for any essential change.
It was not long after that Africk
interposed
to rescue a female slave from the
horrible lash of this tyrant: his fury,
averted from the woman, fell with
redoubled
violence on Africk, till no
longer stimulated by resistance, he
turned
away from his silent victim, and left
him to crawl (for he could not walk)
to his little cabin. The following
morning he was missing; the
plantation
was searched in vain, and I was
despatched by my father in quest of
him, as he deemed it probable that some
of the negroes of our neighbours might
have harboured and concealed him;
these sort of courtesies being not
unfrequent
among our slaves.
I went, but with the determination
never to reveal, if I discovered his
concealment
,
and to afford him every aid
in my power, for my youthful
imagination
had been powerfully excited by his
heroism and his sufferings, and neither
philosophy nor experience had yet
steeled my heart against the spectacle
of human misery. Would to God they
never had!
I began my expedition on foot,
being just then inspired with a passion
to emulate the feats of some European
pedestrians, of whom I had heard. I
cannot remember a period of my life
when some such whim did not rule the
hour. I had entered on Mr. Westall's
grounds, and in order to cross by a
straight line to the cabins of the negroes,
I left the circuitous road, and turned
into some low ground, covered with
pines. It soon became marshy, and
almost impassable, but I had proceeded
too far for retreat or extrication, and I
continued to push forward through the
snarled bushes and interwoven branches
of the trees; the daylight and my
strength were almost exhausted, and my
patience entirely, when I perceived the
ground harden to my tread, and pressing
eagerly forward, I issued from the wood
into an open space, a few roods in
circumference
,
around which the trees
grew so thick, that they formed an
almost
impenetrable wall, a natural
defence
for this sequestered retreat. To
my amazement I saw before me, and
just on the skirt of the wood, a rudely
constructed hut; two of its sides were
formed by slabs resting on the ground
at one end, meeting at the top, and
supported by poles inserted into two
notched posts; the third side was filled
by brush cut from the adjoining wood,
and piled loosely together; the fourth,
towards which I advanced, was quite
open to the weather.
Alsop, I had proceeded thus far in
my narrative, when I threw down my
pen; my fancy had restored me to this
scene of my youth; I had insensibly
reverted to the influences that then
governed my mind, and I felt that I
was exposing the offices of the temple to
the derision of the unbelievers. I protest
against your laugh, and your more
intolerable
ridicule: I know all these things
are the illusions of youth and
ignorance
,
but I sometimes think them better,
certainly far happier, than the realities
I have since adopted. Still vacillating,
you say between philosophy and
superstition
!
amiable
superstition! I have
described this spot with some
particularity
.
It is, with all its
accompaniments
,
indelibly stamped on my memory.
As I said, I advanced towards the
habitation
,
and unperceived by its occupants,
I had leisure to observe and to listen to
them. Africk was lying extended on
some straw with which the ground (for
there was no floor) had been strewn for
this slight accommodation; his head
was supported by an old negro woman;
with one hand he grasped the hand of my
friend, with the other he held firmly a
saphie, which was suspended around his
neck; his short and spasmodic
breathing
indicated the last feeble struggle
with death.
Edmund Westall knelt beside him,
and might have been mistaken for a
bright vision from another and a higher
sphere, so beautiful was the combination
of faith, hope, and charity, as the
enthusiast
paints them, in his fair and
innocent
face. The last rays of the setting
sun entering an aperture in the
wall, fell athwart his brow, burnished
his light brown hair, and rested there,
a bright halo, which seemed the seal of
the celestial ministry. My ear caught
the broken sentence of the dying man.
`No no,' he said; `Mr. Edmund, I
had no peace. I would have given my
life for one moment of freedom. I
looked for revenge. I thought of my
wife and my little ones; and I could
have poured out the blood of white men,
till it should run like the big waters
over which they brought us. But the
voice of God pierced to my heart;
and I was an altered man. And when
I prayed that blessed prayer, that I
might be forgiven even as I forgive
others, the fire in my heart was quenched,
and the terrible storm that had raged
here (and he pressed Edmund's hand
on his naked breast) was laid; and there
was peace, Mr. Edmund; God's peace.
I was a slave, and I was wretched, but
the sting was taken away. Do not
pray for me, nor for mine. I have been
on my knees for my helpless ones, night
after night, and all night long, and my
prayer is heard. But pray for your
father's land, and your father's children.
Pray to be saved from the curse that is
coming. Oh! (he exclaimed,) and his
voice became stronger, and his deep
tones seemed to bear to our ears the
sure words of prophecy; oh, I hear the
cry of revenge; I hear the wailings of
your wives and your little ones; and I
see your fair lands drenched with their
blood. Pray to God to save you in that
day, for it will surely come.' His voice
was spent; his eyes closed, as I believed
for ever, and I sprang towards the bed.
I then perceived that it was a
momentary
exhaustion; he still grasped
Edmund's
hand, and I noticed the feeble
beatings of his heart. The old woman
signed to me to withdraw from before
him; and I silently took my station
beside her. After a few moments, he
again languidly opened his eyes and
said, in a scarcely audible voice, `I
thought I was in my own land; and I
heard the rustling of our leaves, and the
voices of my kindred, and I was feeding
my little ones with their kouskous as
when the destroyers came. My spirit
will pass easier, if I hear the voice of
your prayer, blessed young man. Pray
for my master; for Buckley.' He paused;
and Edmund, in a low tender voice,
began his supplication. At the close of
each petition Africk murmured amen;
VOL. I. E
and at Edmund's fervent intercession
for his oppressors, he opened his eyes,
clasped his hands and in the intensity
of his feeling, half rose from the straw.
The effort exhausted him; he sunk
back on the breast of the old woman,
and expired. She released herself from
him, and then stretching her arms
towards
Heaven, as if in acknowledgment
to Him who had broken the bonds of
Africk's captivity, she clapped her hands
and shouted, `he is free! he is free!'
Edmund and I laid our faces together
on the straw beside the poor negro,
and wept as youth is wont to do.
Forgive me, Alsop, I have told you
a very long, and it may be a very dull
story, though I think not; for nothing
is dull to you that is connected with the
philosophy of the human mind. You
will ridicule me for ever having deemed
of importance the particulars of a vulgar
being, extinct after a few years of life,
and that for the most part passed in
abject slavery; but like a true
philosopher
,
you will with me eagerly explore
the past for the causes that have
influenced
my character and governed my
destiny. And yet, `poor play things
of unpitying fate,' why should we be
so anxious to penetrate the mysteries
of a being which may cease for ever
to-morrow? The epicureans were more
consistent than we are; and we may
learn from the author of a faith that we
deride, the truest wisdom for us; `let
us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.'
This scene has haunted my
imagination
:
the memory of it has sometimes
seemed to me like a voice from Heaven;
for a long while it kept alive a dying
spark of faith. I cherished it as a
testimony
,
that God had not left the
creatures
he had formed to wander without
him in the world: I fancied there was
a supernatural ministry to the spirit of
this much-injured man, that had
converted
his just and unrelenting hatred
to forgivenesshis pride to
submissiveness
and
there seemed a witness to the
E 2
mercy of Heaven in the gentle and
tender
countenance of my friend.
Yes, Alsop, I confess itthe
memory
of this scene has sometimes been an
impassable barrier to your infidel and
most ingenious arguments.
You know one of the boldest, as
well as one of the most charming of
female sceptics, said, `in the silence of
the closet, or the dryness of discussion, I
can agree with the atheist or the
materialist
,
as to the insolubility of certain
questions; but when in the country, or
contemplating nature, my soul, full of
emotion, soars aloft to the vivifying
principle that animates them, to the
almighty intellect that pervades them,
and to the goodness that makes the scene
so delightful to my senses!'
Thus it is with me: nature and the
beautiful traits of nature we sometimes
see in man, appeal irresistibly to my
feelings, and force their way to my
convictions
.
My purpose was, frankly to tell you
my present embarrassments; but I have
been led into too serious a train of
feeling
to proceed any farther, and certainly
to let you into the arcana of my present
perplexities.
I explained to Edmund my
intentions
in regard to Africk. We found
that we had participated in a strong
feeling of compassion towards him,
and this sympathy at once created
a bond of union between us. This
hiding-place had been contrived by
Westall's people for a refuge for the
runaways from the neighbouring
plantations
;
not at all for their own benefit,
for the conduct of the Westalls to their
slaves was noted for its benevolent and
paternal character. The retreat was
kept secret from Mr. Westall, (the
father;) for the negroes rightly
concluded
that he would have been
compelled
in honour to surrender, as the
property of his neighbours, the refugees
who took shelter there. The son had
been conducted to the place by the old
woman, who was his nurse, who knew
she might safely confide the secret to
his custody, and who could not believe
that any case was so desperate that he
could not bring some alleviation to it.
We agreed that Africk's body should
be conveyed during the night to the
cabin of one of the negroes, and should
in the morning be restored to my father.
Before we parted from the remains
of the released slave, we examined the
saphie, which to his last breath, he had
so pertinaciously grasped. You must
know these saphies, are boxes made of
horn, shell, or some other durable mate
rial; they contain some charon, usually
a sentence from the Koran, which serves
as an amulet to keep off evil spirits.
Africk had changed the object of his
superstition, and the infidel charm had
been expelled to give place to the
following
sentence, written at his request
by Westall: `Forgive me my trespasses,
even as I forgive those who trespass
against me.'
At Edmund's instigation, I made
this the occasion of benefit to the other
negroes. I applied to my father in their
behalf, and found my way to his
understanding
by the sure and well-trodden
path of selfishness. I convinced him
that Buckley's cruelty had shortened
Africk's life, and that the tyrant's
harsh treatment of the slaves
prevented
half the profit that might
otherwise be derived from their
labour
.
My father, exasperated by his
recent loss, readily yielded to my
arguments
.
Buckley was dismissed, and an
efficient and tolerably humane overseer
employed in his place. I possessed then,
Alsop, some enthusiasm in the cause of
benevolence, and could have envied, and
possibly might have emulated the fame
of a Howard. But notwithstanding
this strange confession, you need not
now despair of your disciple and friend,
H.
Redwood
.
This epistle very naturally excited
some alarm in Alsop for the security of
his dominion over the mind of his young
disciple. He wrote to him repeatedly,
and received but few, and those brief
replies, till about the expiration of a
year, when an answer to an earnest
solicitation to Redwood to accompany
him to Europe, whither he was going
in a public service, and to his setting
forth in the most tempting manner the
advantages that he offered, he received
the following letter:
Dear Alsop
,
I am grateful for your interest, and
convinced by your arguments that I
ought no longer to doze away my brief
existence in this retirement. I have
obtained
my father's consent to the
arrangement
you propose; and what is still
more indispensable, an ample supply in
consideration of a promise I have given
to him, that I will solicit the hand of my
cousin immediately after my return.
Alsop, I find it necessary to
recollect
all the arguments in favour of
virtue and vice being only conventional
terms, artificial contrivances for man's
convenience; for conscience, conscience,
`that blushing shame-faced spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom,' tells me that
if it is not so, I am the veriest wretch
alive. I am married to a young creature
without fortune, without connexions;
innocent, and beautiful, and
religious;
an odd union, is it not? I have not
intimated
my free opinions to her, for why
should I disturb her superstition? It is
quite becoming to a woman, harmonizes
well with the weakness of her sex, and
is perhaps necessary to it. No one but
the priest (and he is trust-worthy) knows
our secret. My pride, my ambition,
rebel against the humble condition of
life to which this rash indulgence of
boyish passion condemns me. If my
father knew it, he would spurn me; for
my marriage disappoints his favourite
E 3
project, and my poor girl would
provoke
his most inveterate prejudices;
and my mother, my timid mother,
would never forgive me for presuming
to offend my father: there is no
tolerable
alternative; the fact must be
concealed
for the present. Who knows
but one of the tides, which, `taken at
the flood lead on to fortune,' may await
me? any thing is better than to lose
this bright opportunity of pleasure and
advantage. Poor Westall is dead, and
died with unbroken confidence in my
virtue. Is goodness thus credulous? He
has committed his only son, a boy of
four years, to my guardianship. I will
not betray his trust, so help me God.
Yours, &c.
H. R.
Redwood had determined to keep his
intended departure a secret, to save
himself
from the remonstrances and
entreaties
which he naturally expected from
his abused wife. He had no intention
permanently to desert her: she was
residing
in the family of a Mr. Emlyn, as
teacher to his children, and might
remain
there for one, or even two years if
necessary; and in the meantime, an
unforeseen
accession of fortune, political
advancement, or any of the thousand
chances that happen to fortune's
favourites
,
might relieve her husband from
his present embarrassments, and enable
him to invest her with her rights
without
too great a personal sacrifice. By
such and similar considerations he
endeavoured
to soothe his conscience into
acquiescence; but neither these, nor the
sophistries of his friend, availed him to
silence the voice of nature within him,
that incessantly reproached him with
the wrong he was about to inflict on
a young, and innocent, and helpless
being.
On the night before his departure, he
summoned resolution to visit her,
intending
to impart to her his designs,
and to soothe her with such promises
and arguments as he could marshal to
his aid. He found her alone in the little
parlour, which had been kindly assigned
to her. She started at his entrance, and
was hurrying a sheet of paper on which
she was writing into the desk at which
she sat. Treason, treason, said he,
detaining the paper, and at the same
time kissing her pale cheek. Then it
is treason against my own heart, she
replied, for that is but too faithful to
you. Redwood was conscience-stricken,
and to shelter his embarrassment, he
affected to read the letter he had seized:
it was blotted with his wife's tears.
No, do not read it, said she, laying
her hand on it, it is only a little
scolding
;
you know I have so few of the
privileges of a wife, that I cannot but
use those that are not denied me.
Redwood's
eyes were still fixed on the
letter
,
of which, however, he had not read
a single word. She continued, I am
so lonely, that I get low-spirited, and
sometimes I think you do not love me.
Not love you, Mary? exclaimed
Redwood
,
in whose breast there was not at this
moment any feeling so strong as his
tenderness
for the lovely being before him.
Yes, Henry, she replied, with more
courage than she had ever before shown,
and have I not much reason to think
so? I am sure I could not make any
one suffer as you make me; I could not
live and let such a curse rest upon your
blessings. A curse, Mary, what do
you mean? replied her husband.
Oh, is it not a curse, said she, to
feel the misery of guilt and the
punishment
of folly; to be suspected of crime;
to feel the blood freezing in my veins,
from the fear of detection; to see, or
fancy that I see, the smiles of derision
and contempt on the faces of the very
slaves of the plantation, as I pass by
them; and to blush and feel humbled,
when, at the mention of your name, my
eye meets the stolen glances of the
children
?
Oh Henry, I am a woman, and
I cannot bear such suspicions; I am a
wife, and I ought not to bear them.
Redwood was affected by his wife's
appeal; but there was in it an assertion
of rights that mortified his pride and
surprised him; surprised him, because
Mary had always showed herself a timid
being, with unquestioning dependence
on his will, and submissive conformity
to his wishes. He defended himself
as well as he was able: he pleaded his
dependence on his fatherhis dread to
excite his tyrannical passions; he
reminded
her that she had consented to their
clandestine marriage and intercourse.
But, she replied, I was young
and inexperienced, and quite alone; and
I thought, Henry, you could not ask me
to do any thing it was not right to do;
and you promised, before God, to love
and cherish me, and I was quite sure
I never should suffer any evil that you
could shield me from.
And you shall not, Mary, he
replied
;
only have a little patience.
Ah, Henry, patience is the resource
of the miserable; and I, she added,
turning on him a look full of the
confiding
spirit of affection, I ought not to
be miserable.
But what can I do? said he
impatiently
.
Withhold no longer the name to
which you have given me a right; save
me from cruel suspicions and remarks,
and I will endure silently and patiently
any other evil; I will live separate from
you, if your father requires it, or you
wish it; I will never see you again; any
thing will be better than to endure the
torment of shame, for from this torment
the consciousness of innocence has not
preserved me.
Redwood felt the justice of his wife's
cause, and he might have yielded to the
best impulses of his nature, but he
thought he had gone too far with Alsop
to recede; he mentally resolved to
shorten
his absence as much as possible, and
to return to make his wife happy.
Having
appeased his conscience by this
compromise
,
he appealed to her compassion;
he represented, with tenfold
aggravation
,
the embarrassments in which he
was involved, and he soothed her with
professions
of tenderness. Gentle and
affectionate
,
she soon relapsed into trustful
acquiescence, and, with a self-devotion
not singular in a woman, she resolved
and promised to abide his pleasure.
Before
they parted, there was an allusion
made to a flirtation Redwood had had
with his cousin Maria Manning, and to
some tender letters she had written to
him since his marriage, to win him back
from what she supposed to be his
indifference
.
These letters had frequently
been the subject of raillery between the
lovers. Mary had never seen them;
and Redwood, in no humour now to
deny any thing which he could grant
without too great a sacrifice, promised
he would send her the letters the next
morning. He then parted from her,
but not without betraying real anguish,
which his tender-hearted wife blamed
herself for having inflicted on him.
The next morning a pacquet was
brought to her. It continued a brief
farewell from her husband, the most
plausible apology he could frame for his
departure, and a sum of money larger
than he could well afford to spare from
the allowance that he had received
from his father, but by which, as he said,
he meant to enable her to withdraw (if
she should prefer to do so during his
absence) from the situation she then
held. In the hurry of his departure
Redwood had sent, instead of the
promised
pacquet, his correspondence with
Alsop. What a revelation it contained
for his deserted wife! She had reposed
in him the unqualified and unsuspecting
confidence of youth; she had believed
him to be just what he seemedthe
natural
conclusion of inexperience. How
terrible are the reverses of opinion,
when those most tenderly loved are the
subjects of them! It seemed to Mary
Redwood, that she had fallen into an
abyss of hopeless misery. She read
over and over again these fatal letters,
till her head turned, and heart sunk
with the strange confusion of horrible
ideas which they communicated. The
language of the world, of philosophy,
(falsely so called) of infidelity, was an
unknown tongue to her; a strange
jargon
,
which introduced into her mind but
one definite idea, and that a deep
conviction
that her husband was corrupt, more
corrupt in principle than in conduct;
and his conduct the natural and
necessary
result of his principles. Ignorant as
she was of the world, and all its
intolerance
and artificial distinctions, she had
never dreamed that her lowly fortune
and rank opposed a barrier to her
acknowledgment
.
The love of women is sometimes
ranked with incurable diseases. Mary
Redwood's at least was not so; perhaps
her husband seemed to her to lose his
identity from the moment that she
discovered
his real sentiments; however
that may be, the discovery cut the cord
that bound her to him; and the repose
and happiness of trustful affection, and
feminine dependence, and the confidence
of youthful expectation, gave place to
deep despondency, and to all the apathy
of complete alienation. It was
impossible
for her to conceal a change so
suddenly
wrought in her feelings, and the
good people with whom she was living,
believed young Redwood's departure
for Europe to be the cause of it.
They had for a long time been
apprised
of his secret visits, and suspicious
of his designs; but the purity and
gentleness
of Mary's manners rebuked
suspicion, and they hesitated to
communicate
their observations to her:
besides they were engaged with their
own concerns, and the transient love
affair (as they deemed it) of an obscure
young girl, seemed to them of no great
moment. They felt some regret, when,
after the lapse of a few days, she
announced
her wish to relinquish the
care of their children, assigning as a
reason the evident decline of her health,
and she did not leave them without
generous tokens of their gratitude for
her fidelity. At the time of her
departure
,
her friend, Mrs. Westall, was
absent on a visit to a distant plantation;
this she esteemed fortunate, for she
wished to escape any observation that
would have been stimulated by
affection
.
She resolved never to reveal the
secret
of her marriage; and thanking
God that her parents were removed
from this world, and that none
remained
to be deeply affected with her
misfortunes
,
she determined to seek out some
retreat where she might be sheltered
from notice. As the carriage drove
away that conveyed her from the door of
Mr. Emlyn, Mrs. Emlyn turned from
the window where she had stood gazing
after her, and said to her husband, is
it not strange that Mary should not
have felt more at parting with the
children? she did not seem to notice
their caresses, and poor things, they
cried as if their little hearts would break;
she is kind-hearted too. And did
you not mind mother, asked one of the
little girls, that when I offered that
pretty shell-box Mr. Redwood gave me
for a keepsake, she shivered as if she
had the ague, and dropped it on the
floor?
Ah, said Mr. Emlyn, looking
significantly
at his wife, it is easy enough
to see where the shoe pinches. I tell
you my dear, that fellow has nearly
broken the girl's heart. It is just so
with all your tribe; `all for love, or the
world well lost.' But she will come to
her senses. `Sur les aile du temps la
tristesse
s'envole.'
CHAPTER IV.
"Si un homme honnte avoit fait un mal irreparable  un
tre innocent comment, sans le secours de l'expiation
religieuse,
s'en consolerait-il jamais."
Mad. de Stael
R
edwood
joined his friend, and they
embarked together for Europe,
furnished
with every facility for an
introduction
to good society which Americans
could then procure. They visited Paris,
and gained admission to its highest
literary circles: to society the most
dangerous, and the most captivating,
men and women, who from having been
born thralls to the despotic dogmas and
pompous ritual of the Romish church,
had identified the corruptions of Christianity
with its truth, and rejecting the
galling yoke, had loosened all necessary
and salutary restraints. There was in
them much to be admired by a virtuous
person, much to excite the sympathy of
the representative of a young republic,
for they had an unaffected zeal for
the happiness of their species, and a
genuine hatred of every mode of tyranny.
They had too an amenity and exquisite
refinement of manners, which they owed
to the vital spirit that Christianity had
infused into civilized life, and which
remained after the spirit had departed;
as the body from which the soul has fled
retains, while life is still recent, its fair
proportions, and beautiful expression; or,
as a plant which the passing gale has
uprooted, is still decorated with the
flowers that owed their birth to the
parent earth. In these circles,
Redwood's
devotion to intellectual power
(the ruling passion of his youth) revived,
and he resigned himself to the charms
of society, to those pleasures which one
who was their victim, has, with a few
vivid touches, described la parole n'y
est pas seulement comme ailleurs un
moyen de se communiquev ses ides, ses
sentiments, et ses affaires mais c'est un
instrument dont on aime  jouer et qui
ranime les esprits, comme la musique
chez quelque peuples, et les liqueurs
fortes chez quelques autres.
[1]
[1]
Conversation is not there as elsewhere, simply a
medium for the communication of ideas and
sentiments
,
and the transaction of business; but it is
instrument on which they delight to play, and
which excites their spirits, like music among some
nations, and strong liquors among others.
And in
these circles, Redwood felt that Paris
etait lieu du monde o l' on pouvoit
le mieux se passer de bonheur.
Paris was that place in the whole world where
one might best dispense with happiness.
While he remained in the French
capital, there was no suspension of
excitement
,
not an hour for reflection,
VOL. I. F
scarcely a solitary moment for the
impertinent
whispering of conscience. His
wife, the young and innocent creature,
who had surrendered to him the whole
treasure of her affections, abandoned
solitary, sick, and heart-broken, was
scarcely remembered, or if remembered,
was always associated with the dark
cloud with which she had shaded his
future fortunes. But after he had left
Paris, in the further prosecution of his
travels, there were times when she was
remembered; the powers of conscience,
spell-bound by the noise and glare of
society, were awakened by the voice of
the Divinity issuing from the eloquent
places of nature. The pure streams, the
placid lakes, the green hills, and the
fixed mountains looking tranquillity,
seemed to reproach him with his
desertion
of nature's fairer work; for all the
works of nature are linked together by
an invisible, an electric chain.
Redwood
hurried from place to place; he
tried the power of novelty, of activity,
he gazed on those objects that have
been the marvel, and the delight of the
world; and when the first excitement
was over, he felt that he could not resist
the great moral law which has
indissolubly
joined virtue and happiness.
On his arrival at Rome he found
letters awaiting him there. To avoid
the hazard of discovery, he had
determined
that all intercourse between
himself
and his wife should be suspended
during his absence, and had purposely
omitted to furnish her with his address
his anxiety to receive some intelligence
from her, had, however, become so strong
that he would now have willingly
incurred
any risk for that gratification. On
turning over his letters, he noticed one
in a hand writing which he recognised
to be that of the clergyman who had
married him to Mary Erwine; he hastily
tore it open. There was within it a
letter from his wife, and a few lines
F 2
from the clergyman stated that he had
received that letter enclosed in another,
and post-marked Philadelphia: he was
requested to forward it by the first
conveyance
,
and to inform him to whom it
was addressed, that the writer had died
two days after closing the letter.
Alsop entered Redwood's apartment
a moment after he had read the letter,
and while he was yet nearly stunned
with the sudden blow: Alsop looked at
the unsealed letter which had fallen
on the floor, and then took the open one
from the unresisting hand of his friend,
who, while he hid his convulsed face
with his hands, exclaimed, oh, I have
killed her, AlsopI have killed her!
No, no, replied Alsop,
comprehending
at a glance the import of the
intelligence, nature sentenced her;
you may have hastened the execution
but that's all. What do you mean by
this drivelling, Redwood? Is it thus you
receive one of fate's happiest strokes?
By my soul, man, I have been a sworn
knight to my lady Fortune for these
twenty years, following her through
good and evil report, and for all my
devoted services, I have never obtained
one such favour.
There was an audacity in this levity
which quickened to keen resentment the
awakened feelings of Redwood. He
spurned Alsop from him, and resigned
himself to the tide of misery that
overwhelmed
his fortitude. As soon as he
could command sufficient courage, he
opened his wife's letterit was cold
and brief, without a request or reproach;
and simply informed him that after his
departure she had sought a retirement
where she might prepare herself for that
better world, towards which her
heavenly
Father in his tender mercy was
evidently leading her: she had found
one; and had received under the
humble
roof where she should soon close her
eyes for ever, every kindness that
humanity
could render. Should any regrets
induce Redwood to make inquiries about
her, she informed him they would be
vain and uselessvain, for she had taken
every precaution to keep the place of
her retreat secretand useless, for she
should then be where no human being
could confer happiness, or inflict misery
on her. Some portions of the letter
betrayed strong emotions, but apparently
it did not result from the relations
which had subsisted between herself and
him, to whom she wrote. It was an
elevated state of feeling with which no
personal considerations seemed to mingle,
in which she regarded what had passed,
not as offences against herself, but as
portending misery to Redwood. The
letter concluded thusyou will not,
she said, need the assurance of my
forgiveness; believe me I have no sterner
feeling than pity for you. I have sought,
and till my heart is stilled in death, I
shall seek for you
his
mercy who came
to heal the sick, to seek the lost, and to
restore the wanderer. Farewell,
Redwood
,
God grant the prayer of your
dying wife.
And is this all, thought Redwood,
that remains to me of the tenderness of
youthful love; of that innocent
generous
affection, that questioned not,
suspected
not? oh, I have most foully
betrayed
her trust! we are severed for ever
yes, for ever; for surely if there is a
heaven, she has entered it; and II have
no placeno hope there. I could have
borne reproaches, invectives, any thing
I could have borne better than this calm
tone which pronounces the sentence of
deatheternal death to our union.
There is perhaps no keener suffering
to a generous mind, than the
consciousness
of having inflicted a wrong which
cannot be repaired. Redwood's first
hasty resolution was to make the poor
amends in his power, to return to his
country, proclaim his marriage with
Mary Erwine, and endure the infamy
his desertion deserved. No sacrifice
appeared to him too great to appease
the clamours of his conscience, no
self-mortification
too severe, if he might
thereby pay a tribute to her memory,
whose life he had embittered and cut off
in its early prime.
But after the first access of grief and
contrition gave place to calm and
natural
considerations, he saw that however
just might be his conduct, still it must be
quite useless to the injured being whom
he could no longer serve nor harm.
She was an orphan, without any near
connexions to inquire after, or to be
afflicted by her destiny: why then
should he publish his own infamy, which
could never be mitigated in the eye of
the world by the knowledge of the
virtuous
intention and severe remorse,
which, as Redwood hoped, in some
measure softened its deepest colouring?
These were certainly reasonable
considerations
;
and though every one must
wish that Redwood had followed the
simple dictate of right, no one who
knows how very cogent arguments
appear on that side to which the
inclinations
lean, will be surprised that his
virtuous
resolutions should have died away,
and his good emotions have subsided;
but they did not subside without
permanent
effects. The wave retreated, but
its ravages remained; and Henry
Redwood
carried through life a fast-rooted
misery, a sense of injustice recklessly
committed; a feeling of degradation that
led him to turn from all that is fair and
good, as a sick eye shuts out the light of
heaven.
Redwood avoided the poisonous
society
of Alsop. He left Rome after
wandering
for a little time about its magnificent
ruins; the melancholy tone of his mind
suiting well with their gloomy grandeur.
From Italy he repaired to England, and
after rambling over our parent land,
F 3
and admiring without enjoying its
beauties
,
he returned to his native country.
Quite indifferent to his own domestic
fate, he yielded a ready compliance to
the importunate wishes of his father and
mother, and solicited and easily obtained
the hand of his cousin Maria Manning, a
spoilt child and flattered beauty. Her
girlish preference of her handsome
cousin
had been stimulated by the difficulty
of achieving the conquest of his
affections
;
and if her vanity had been piqued
by his long apparent indifference and
protracted absence, it was quite soothed
by the professedly unqualified
admiration
of one who had gazed on foreign
beauties, and had been received with
favour in the circles of rank and fashion
in countries more polished than our own.
The ceremony of Redwood's marriage
was celebrated with all due pomp and
circumstance. A troop of gratified
friends attended him to the altar,
whither
he led his beautiful bride, the ido
of fashion and the favourite of fortune:
one person alone in all the assembly
rightly interpreted his faltering voice,
restless movements, and changing colour,
and the fixed gaze that proved his
thoughts intent on the visions of his
imagination. It was the same church
to which, at twilight, and in secrecy he
had led the trustful girl, whose artless
tenderness, simple and spiritual beauty,
and unsuspecting confidence, haunted
him at this moment. The same
clergyman
officiated who had then recorded
his plighted faith. Neither the dogmas
of a selfish philosophy, nor the training
of the world had indurated Redwood's
heart. At the moment the service
concluded
,
he staggered from the side of
his bride, and caught hold of the railing
around the altar. The clergyman
whispered
,
you betray yourself, Mr.
Redwood
.
His father bustling up to him,
called him in the same breath, a lucky
dog and an odd fish; and his young
friends crowding around him, mingled
with their congratulation well-timed
raillery of his timidity. Recovering his
self-possession, he parried their attacks
skilfully, and apologized to his wife with
the adroit courtesy of a well-bred man;
and she, with the happy facility of
habitual
vanity, not knowing what his
emotion meant, believed it meant
something
flattering to herself.
Redwood now entered on the career
of politics. His wife was the bright
cynosure of the fashionable world; and
both were the envy of those who form
their childish judgments by externals,
forgetting that the most brilliant hues
are reflected by empty vapours. Mrs
Redwood survived her marriage but a
few years, and left at her death one
child, Caroline, whom she consigned to
her mother. The child was accordingly
transferred to the care of Mrs. Olney;
and conveyed to Charleston, S. Carolina,
the residence of that lady, who evinced
her grief for the death of her daughter,
by lavishing on the child a twofold
measure
of the indulgences and flatteries
that had spoiled the mother.
Mrs. Olney's notions of education
were not peculiar. In her view, the few
accomplishments quite indispensable to a
young lady, were dancing, music, and
French. To attain them, she used all
the arts of persuasion and bribery; she
procured a French governess who was a
monument of patience; she employed a
succession of teachers, that much
enduring
order, who bore with all long
suffering
,
the young lady's indolence, caprices,
and tyranny. At the age of seven, the
grandmother's vanity no longer
brooking
delay, the child was produced at
balls and routs, where her singular
beauty attracted every eye, and her
dexterous, graceful management of her
little person, already disciplined to the
rules of Vestris, called forth loud
applauses
.
The child and grandmother
were alike bewildered with the incense
that was offered to the infant belle, and
future heiress; and alike unconscious of
the sidelong looks of contempt and
whispered sneers which their pride and
folly provoked. At fourteen Miss.
Redwood
,
according to the universal phrase
to express the debt of a young lady,
was brought out, that is, entered the
lists as a candidate for the admiration
of fashion, and the pretensions of lovers.
At eighteen, the period which has been
selected to introduce her to our readers;
she was the idol of the fashionable
world, and as completely
au fait
in all its
arts and mysteries, as a veteran belle of
five-and-twenty.
Mr. Redwood had received the noblest
gifts of his Creator: a mind that
naturally
aspired to heaven, and sensibilities
that inclined him to all that was pure,
and good, and lovely. The worldly
advantages
he possessed would have been
the means of happiness to a vulgar, or
even an ordinary character; but they
had no control over a spirit that could
not endure to be limited to the objects of
selfish gratification, to bound its desires
and pursuits within the earthy
prison-house
.
After a few years, he, wearied
of the toil and strife of political life,
resigned
its honours, and embarked for
Europe, from whence, after having
worn out two or three years in a vain
effort to escape from the demons of
restlessness and ennui, he returned to
his own country to seek happiness,
where none but the good find it, at
home
.
He was surprised with the ripened
beauty of his daughter, but most severely
mortified to find her just what he ought
to have expected from the influences to
which he had abandoned her. He had
never felt so strong an affection for the
child as would seem to have been
natural
.
His indifference to her mother,
the circumstances that preceded his
marriage, and perhaps the child's
resemblance
to the parent, accounted in part
for this want of affection; and the
carelessness
that was the result of it was to
be expected from one governed more
by casual impulses than principle.
Mr. Redwood hoped it was not too
late to repair his fault. He perceived
that his daughter possessed spirit and
talents
not quite extinguished by her mode
of education and life; and for the
purpose
of breaking off all unfavourable
associations, and removing her from the
influence of her doating grandmother,
he resolved on a tour through the
northern
states.
Mr. Redwood hoped too that this
jaunt might lead to the accomplishment
of a project which he had long secretly
cherished; a union between his
daughter
and Charles Westall, the son of his
earliest friend. He had transferred to
the son the strong affection he bore to
his father; and though he had not seen
him since his childhood, he had from
report, and from an occasional
correspondence
,
conceived the highest opinion
of his character. Time and philosophy
had failed to subdue Mr. Redwood's
ardent temperament: he still pressed on
with eagerness to the accomplishment
of his wishes, flattering himself all the
while that he had ceased to be the dupe
of the promises which the future makes
to the inexperienced and the hopeful.
Mr. Redwood and his daughter had
made the fashionable tour, that is to
say, had visited the lakes of Niagara,
and the Canadas, and had turned their
course towards Boston, when the
unfortunate
accident which has been
mentioned
put a stop to their progress, and
deposited them for a while at the house
of a respectable New England farmer.
CHAPTER V.
She cameshe is gonewe have met
And meet perhaps never again.
Cowper
.
As
the day closed, on which Mr.
Redwood's
journey had been so suddenly
suspended, the full-orbed moon rose
above the summit of the highest hills
that border the eastern shore of
Champlain
.
Not a vestige of the storm remained,
not a cloud stained the clear vault of
heaven, and the scene looked the more
beautiful as contrasted with its recent
turbulence. The vapour was condensed
on the low grounds, and instead of
impeding
the rays of the bright queen
of heaven, looked as if she had
sheltered
some favourite spots with a silvery
mantle; and the broad lake, glad to be
relieved from the stern shadows that
shrouded it, smiled and dimpled in the
rich flood of light that fell on its bosom,
and reflected in its clear mirror the
pasture-hills
,
covered with social herds, that
descended to its margin; and the
water-loving
willow, the chesnut with its
horizontal
branches and pendant blossoms,
and the little trig-birch that shadowed its
brim. The location of the farm-houses
planted here and there on the
surrounding
hills was marked by the tall
Lombardy
poplar, which through our
country-towns
is every where the sign of a
habitation. The moon-beams played
on the white dwelling of Mr. Lenox,
which had an air of prosperity and
refinement above any of its neighbours,
from the ample, well fenced fields
around it, a colony of barns behind it,
and a neat little court-yard containing
peach and cherry trees, and rosebushes,
and vines skilfully guided around the
windows, and all enclosed by a curiously
wrought fence, on which the village
architect had exhausted all the cunning
of his trade. Mr. Lenox's family had
retired to their several apartments,
excepting
those who were appointed to
keep their vigils with the sick stranger.
He had complained of the closeness of
the air, and Deborah had opened doors
that communicated by a narrow passage
with another apartment. She had then
stationed herself near the door, where,
after a few moments, her loud breathing
announced that she was in a profound
sleep. Mr. Redwood observed a female
sitting in the passage and obscured by
its shadows, who seemed to be stationed
there to act as a prompter to Deborah,
for whenever he was restless she awoke
the sleeper. In the opposite room he
perceived the body of the young man
he had heard spoken of, the head was
placed directly under a window through
which the full-moon shone so brightly,
that every object was almost as distinctly
seen as by the light of day. At another
time, or in health, Mr. Redwood would
have been quite unmoved by such a
spectacle, for death has no heart-stirring
associations to him who deems that the
spirit shall vanish into soft air, and we
shall be hereafter as though we had never
been; but there are few minds that are
independent of the condition of the
animal
;
and Mr. Redwood, weakened by
his sufferings, and his imagination
stimulated
by a large dose of laudanum that
had excited instead of composing him,
felt himself yielding to the power of
busy and bitter fancies. The light
graceful
figure of the young female as she gently
moved to awaken the amazon, seemed
to touch some secret spring of his
imagination
,
and once, as he fell into a dreamy
state, the wife of his youth was near
him, but cold and silent, as the dead
form he had just closed his eyes upon,
and when he started and awoke and saw
the young female standing like a statue
in the door-way, he identified her with
his vision and exclaimed, for God's
sake speak to me. Deborah was
awakened
by the sound, and her coarse voice
inquiring what he wanted, restored him
at once to realities. She gave him at
his request a composing draught, and
again resumed her station, and saying
she believed she had been almost asleep,
she resumed instantly her harsh nasal
sounds; the only sounds that broke the
stillness of the night, save the falling of
the swollen drops of water as they rolled
from leaf to leaf on the branches of the
trees about the window.
By degrees Mr. Redwood became
composed, and was just yielding
himself
to nature's best medicine, when his
attention was aroused by the sound of
light footsteps approaching the house.
He heard the latch of an outer door
gently raised, (for here fastenings were
considered a superfluity,) and a young
girl glided into the opposite room. Mr.
Redwood saw that she passed, observed
but not molested by his attendant. His
attention was now thoroughly excited.
She lingered for a moment, apparently
from irresolution or timidity, and then
throwing aside a shawl in which she had
muffled herself, she knelt beside the
body of the young man, and removing
the covering from his face, she gazed
intently upon it: the light fell on her
own, still beautiful, though distorted
and almost convulsed with the tumult
of her feelings. After remaining for a
few moments motionless, she laid her
burning forehead on the cold breast of
the young man, and sobbed passionately.
The young lady who had been a passive
spectator of the poor girl's involuntary
grief, now advanced to shut the door,
apparently with the purpose of
sheltering
her from the observation of the
stranger, but he, perceiving her
intention
,
and unable to repress his curiosity,
called to entreat her to permit it to
remain
open. The loud sobs of the girl
awakened the grandmother of the
deceased
,
who, reluctant to separate
herself
for a moment from the body of her
grandson, had insisted on performing
herself the customary duty of watching
with the dead; but overcome with her
grief and infirmities, she had fallen asleep.
She recognised immediately in the
afflicted
girl, the object of her child's
youthful
and constant affections; whose girlish
coquetries and caprices had been the
first cause of that inward disease,
which Deborah had pronounced the
occasion of his death. She advanced to
her with trembling steps, and laying her
hand on the girl's head, and stroking
back her beautiful hair, poor silly
child, she said in a pitiful tone, you
have come too late: once his heart would
have leaped at a word from you, but he
does not hear you now. He loved you,
Anne, and for that I cannot help loving
you; and she stooped and kissed the
girl, who was awed into silence by her
unexpected appearance, and her calm
tone. A grief have you been to him,
Anne; but the Lord changed his
mourning
into joy, for when friend and lover
forsook him, then he turned to the sure
friend. Oh, she continued, he was
my last earthly hope, the staff of my
age; he was good, always good, but
and the tears poured down her pale
wrinkled face, but it was his
adversities
that made him wise unto salvation.
Sorrow upon sorrow, cloud upon cloud,
and he from the first such a feeling
creature
.
Mrs. Allen's lamentation was
interrupted by the hysterical sobbings
of the penitent girl, My poor child,
she said, in a compassionate tone, do
not break your heart; sore mourning
is it indeed for a wrong done to the dead,
but it was not you, Anne that killed
VOL. I. G
him; no, that was just the beginning
of it; then came his parent's losses, his
father's death, and his mother's; but all
these were dust on the balance; time to
eternity compared with the backsliding
of Emily; his root withered when this
branch was lopped off. Oh, my dear
boy, how often have I heard you say
you would die for her if thereby you
could bring her back from her idolatry.
Here the aged mourner was again
interrupted
,
and all were startled by the
rumbling of an approaching waggon;
the young lady quick as thought, flew
to the window. They are here, she
exclaimed; and then turning to the old
woman, I entreat you dear, dear Mrs.
Allen, she said to leave the room;
indeed you are not able to see them
to-night.
Oh, Ellen, I care not for myself,
say not a word; this may be the Lord's
set time to call home the wanderer; I
will not shrink from the trial, if it was
my last breath, I would spend it in
setting her sin before her.
But not now, Mrs. Allen, surely not
now; this is not the time to harrow up
the poor girl's feelings; consider for one
moment she has yet to learn Edward's
death; she is exhausted with her
journey, spare her, spare yourself
to-night
.
Ellen you know not what you
ask, replied the old woman, who
seemed to gather strength and energy
to obey what she regarded as a call of
duty. Are we not, she asked, to
pluck out the right eye, to pluck off
the right arm, if thereby we may save
the soul? Ellen, I will speak to her;
and if she is not dead to natural
affection
,
the light of that pale still face
will send my words home to her
heart.
In vain Ellen argued and entreated.
Mrs. Allen seemed persuaded, or as she
expressed herself, she felt that now, if
G 2
ever, was the set time for the
deliverance
of the child from captivity.
Debby, roused at the near approach
of the waggon, and again said, she
did not know but she had been dosing;
and, listening to the bustle in the
opposite
apartment, what does all this
mean? said she; I thought Ellen
was fit to be trusted, is there no
discretion
in a young head?
Mr. Redwood assured her that the
young lady had not failed in her duty in
the least; that the door had been
continued
open at his request. Oh well, well,
it is all very well: it is a good rule never
to cross the sick in their notions. While
making this sage observation, she
advanced
to the window. For the land's
sake, she exclaimed, what has
tempted
Susan Allen to come with Emily! It
will go nigh to break the old woman's
heart to see her. Ah, there will be no
good come of it, for there is that old
grim master-devil, brother Reuben.
In the name of heaven, exclaimed
Mr. Redwood, who is Emily? and
who is Susan? am I dreaming, or
what does it all mean?
No man, you are not dreaming, but
I guess in your right mind. Emily
Allen is a young girl twin sister to
Eddy there in the other room; she has
been befooled by the shaking quakers,
at least by her Aunt Susan, that has
been one these thirty years; and Susan
is a half crazy woman and half saint;
and there is the old woman that is
mother to Susan and grandmother to
Emily, that is taking on about them as
if they were sold to the evil one. But,
Sir, we are disobeying Doctor Bristol's
orders, and that an't honouring the
physician with the honour that is due
to him: and thus concluding, she
proceeded
to close the door that led through
the passage. Mr. Redwood had been
beguiled of the tedious sleepless hours,
by the curious spectacle of natural
feeling
,
undisguised by any of the artificial
modes of society, and he was now
determined to see the new characters
that were entering on the scene. He
entreated Deborah to permit the door
to remain open, and she, after
examining
his pulse, and looking at his eye to
detect any incipient wildness, decided
that it would not be indiscreet to gratify
him.
To convey to our readers a clear idea
of this scene, we shall describe it as it
really occurred, and not as it appeared
to Mr. Redwood, who by the dim light,
and at the distance he was laid from the
parties, was compelled to be satisfied
with a very imperfect observation.
Ellen opened the outer door for the
two females, who entered dressed in the
shaker uniform, only remarkable for its
severe simplicity and elaborate neatness.
Both wore striped blue and white cotton
gowns, with square muslin
handkerchiefs
pinned formally over the bosom,
their hair combed back, and covered
with muslin caps with straight borders,
and white as the driven snow. Susan,
the elder, was between forty and fifty
years of age: she was tall and erect;
and though rather slender in proportion
to her height, well-formed. There was
an expression of command in all her
movements that seemed natural to her,
and sate gracefully upon her. Her face
had the same character of habitual
independence
and native dignity: the hues
of youth had faded, but a connoisseur
would have pronounced her at a single
glance to have been handsome. Her
features were large, and all finely formed;
her eye, there, where the spirit has its
throne of light, beamed with
intelligence
and tenderness. It was softened
by a rich dark eye-lash, and of that
equivocal
hue, between gray and hazel,
which seems best adapted to show every
change of feeling; but vain is this
description
of colour and shape. It was
the expression of strong and rebuked
passions, of tender and repressed
affections
,
of disciplined serenity, and a soft
melancholy, that seemed like the
shadow
of past sufferings, which altogether
constituted the power and interest of
her remarkable face.
The younger female was short and
slightly formed. Her features were
small; her blue eyes, light hair, and fair
complexion, would have rendered her
face insipid but that it was rescued by an
expression of purity and innocence, and
a certain appealing tender look, that
suited well her quiet and amiable
character
.
As they entered, Ellen threw her arms
around the younger sister, exclaiming
in a tone of the tenderest concern, dear
Emily, why did you not come sooner?
Emily trembled like an aspen leaf, and
her heart beat as if it would have leapt
from her bosom, but she made no reply.
The elder sister grasped Ellen's hand,
Is it even so? she said: she rightly
interpreted Ellen's silence and sadness:
I foresaw, she continued, that our
coming would be worse than in vain:
then turning to her young companion,
she said, put thy hand on thy mouth,
and be still, my child. The mighty One
hath done it, strive not against Him, for
he giveth not account of any of his
matters
.
A loud groan was heard in the
apartment
of the dead. Susan Allen started,
and exclaimed, is my mother here?
then, mother Anne be with me! She
paused for a moment, and added in a
calm tone, fear not, Emily, my child,
in your weakness strength shall be made
perfect; we shall not be left without the
testimony. Her words were quick,
and her voice raised, as if she felt that
she was contending against rebellious
nature. She entered the room with a
slow and firm step. Emily followed
her, but it seemed not without faltering,
G 3
for Ellen had passed her arm around her,
and appeared to sustain half her weight.
Her face was as pale as marble, and
as still.
Pray speak to them, Mrs. Allen,
whispered Ellen: yes, speak to them,
said Debby, in a voice of authority;
what signifies it! they are your own
children, and there is no denying it.
They were my children, but they
have gone out from me, and are not of
me, replied the old woman, in a voice
scarcely audible. I am alone; they
are uprooted; I am as an old oak, whose
leaf has withered; judgment has come
out against me.
She is going clean distracted,
whispered Debby to Ellen, you can
do any thing with her; make her hear
to reason while she has any left, and
get her to go out of the room with
you.
No no, said the old woman, who
had over-heard Debby's whisper, have
no fear for me, my spirits are a little
fluttered
,
and my soul is in travail for these
wanderers, to get them back to my
rest, and under my wing; but the Lord's
own peace is in my heart and none can
trouble that. Oh, she continued,
bursting into tears, as she turned her
eyes from Emily to fix them on Susan,
was it not enough that you were led
captive by Satan, enough for you to
put on his livery, but you must tempt
this child to follow you in your
idolatries
?
Strong sensibility is perhaps
never extinguished; but Susan's was so
subdued that, obedient to the motion of
her will, it had soon returned to flow
in its customary channels. She replied
to her mother's appeal in her usual
deliberate
manner. The child is not my
captive, mother she has obeyed the
gospel, and, added she, looking at
Emily with affectionate complacency,
she has already travelled very far
out of an evil nature, and the believers
are looking to see her stand in the
foremost
light, so clear is the testimony of
her life against all sin. Susan had
an habitual influence over Emily; she
felt that she commanded the springs
that governed the mind of her timid
disciple. Emily felt it too, and was
glad to be saved from the efforts of
self-dependence. She approached Susan,
who had seated herself by the bed-side,
when her grandmother took her by the
hand, and drawing her towards her, she
said in a voice scarcely audiblefor
sorrow
,
infirmity and despair almost
deprived
her of utteranceOh, Emily
my child, my only child has she
bewitched
you? She drew the
unresisting
girl towards the body of her
brother,there, look on him, Emily,
though dead, he yet speaketh to you, and
if nature is not quite dead in you, you
will hear him, he calls to you to break
to pieces your idols, and to come out
from the abominations of the land whither
ye have been carried away captive.
Emily sighed heavily and wept, but said
nothing. Susan moved to the other side
of her, and seeming to lose the spirit of
controvesy in some gentle
remembrance
,
she said, Edward was a good
youth, and lived up to the light he had.
There is one point where all roads
meet; one thing certain, mother, she
added, an intelligent smile brightening
her fine face, we shall all be judged
according to the light we have: some
have a small, and some a great
privilege
.
She has hit the nail on the head for
once, whispered Debby to Ellen: and
now Ellen, before they get into another
snarl, do separate them.
Ellen's heart was full; she felt for all
the parties a very tender, and an almost
equal interest; and though she would
have rejoiced in Emily's renunciation
of her errors, she did not probably
regard
the sincere adoption of them with
the terror and despair which the
grandmother
felt.
My dear friends, she said, gently
taking the hands of the mother and
daughter, and joining them, there is
that in the face of your good Edward
that bears an admonition to all our
hearts, and teaches us all to remember
how often we are commanded to love
one another, and to be at peace one
with another. It was the beloved
apostle
who said, `He that doeth good is of
God:' may not then those who try
to do his will, leave the rest to his
mercy. There was the eagerness and
the authority of truth and goodness in
Ellen's voice, and manner, and words;
the spirit of love and of reconciliation;
and the troubled waters would have
been laid at rest, for the raised eye of
the old lady showed that true devotion
was working at her heart; and Susan
looked on her acquiescingly and
approvingly
;
and Emily's face shone with an
expression of gratitude that her lips
could not utter: but at this moment the
outer door again opened, and Reuben
Harrington, that one of the brethren,
whom Debby had characterized as the
master-devil, entered.
He seemed to have arrived at that
age, which the poet has characterized
as the period of self-indulgence; and
certainly he bore no marks of having
disobeyed the instincts of nature by any
mortifications of the flesh. He was of
a middling stature, inclining to
corpulency
;
with a sanguine complexion, a
low forehead deeply shaded with bushy
black hair, that absolutely refused to
conform to the sleekness of his order;
a keen gray eye, which had a peculiarly
cunning expression from a trick he had
early acquired, and of which he could
never rid himself, of tipping a knowing
wink; a short thick nose turning
upward
;
a wide mouth, with the corners
sanctimoniously drawn down, and a
prominent fat chin following the
direction
of his nose. In short, he presented
a combination and a form to awaken
the suspicions of the most credulous,
and confirm the strongest prejudices
against a fraternity that would advance
such a brother to its highest honoursor,
to use their own phrase, to the dead.
Reuben advanced to the bedside quite
unceremoniously, and seemed to survey
the dead and the living with as much
indifference as if he did not belong to
their species. No one spoke to him,
nor did he speak, till his attention was
arrested by poor Anne, who had shrunk
away from the side of the bed, and sat
on a low chair at its foot enveloped in
her shawl, and sobbing aloud,
apparently
unconscious that any one saw or
heard her. Who is that young
woman
,
inquired Harrington of Debby,
that is making such an unseemly ado,
is she kin to the youth?
No! uttered in her harshest voice,
was all the reply Debby vouchsafed.
Some tie of a carnal nature, ha?
pursued Harrington. No such thing,
said Debby, Eddy was her
sweetheart
.
Yea, yea, that is just what I meant,
woman. Well, he continued, with a
long drawn gutteral groan, the
children
of this world must bake as they
have brewed; they are in the
transgression
,
and they must drink the bitter
draught their own folly has mixed.
After this consolatory harangue, he
turned from the bedside, and began not
humming, but shouting with the utmost
power of his voice, a shaker tune, at all
times sufficiently dissonant, and that now
in this apartment of death and sorrow
sounded like the howl of an infernal: to
this music he shuffled and whirled in
the manner which his sect call dancing
and labour worship.
Stop your dumb pow-wow! cried
Debby, seizing him by the arm with a
force that might have made a stouter
heart than Reuben's rejoice in the
protection
of the convenient principle of
non-resistance.
Nay, ye world's woman, let me
alone, said he, extricating himself from
her grasp, and composing his
neck-cloth
,
which Deborah's rough handling
had somewhat ruffled; know me for
a peaceable man, that wars not with
earthly powers.
True, replied Debby, your war
is with heavenly powers; but while
the Lord is pleased to spare the strength
of my right arm, I'll keep you
peaceable
.
Peaceable! indeed, one would
have thought all bedlam had been let
loose on uspeaceable! your yells
almost
sacred the old lady's soul out of
her body.
Poor Mrs. Allen, to whom Reuben's
singing had sounded like a shout of
victory
from the infernal host, now really
seemed in danger of such a catastrophe.
She could scarcely raise her heavy
eyelids
,
and the low moaning sounds that
escaped her betrayed the infirmity of
age, and the grief that words cannot
express. Ellen renewed her entreaties
that she would retire to her own room.
No longer capable of resistance, she
silently acquiesced, and Ellen conducted
her to her bed, and watched over her, till
she perceived that her wearied nature
had sunk to repose. She then left her,
and was softly closing the door, when
she met Debby in the passage. Now
child, said Deborah, it is time that for
once you should think a little of
yourself
;
go to bed and take a good nap;
there is no occasion for your going back
to that room; it is quiet enough there
now: poor little Ann stole away when
nobody saw her, and I got the old man
out, and gave him some victuals, and
he is making a hearty meal.
Where are Susan and Emily?
inquired
Ellen they must need rest more
than I do.
Yes, poor souls, they need it enough,
but they will not take it; they are only
waiting for Reuben to go away again.
Awaybefore the funeral?
Yes, and I think Susan has the right
of it: she says `the dead need them not,
and they are no comfort to the living.'
And, to tell you the truth, she added, in a
lower tone, I suspect she is now afraid
to trust Emily here any longer. You
know she and our James always had a
notion for each other, and I guess Susan
has found it out too; for though she is
not much used to the world, she is a cute
woman by natur', and sees as far into a
millstone, as a'most any body. I marked
her looking at Emily when James came
into the room, for you must know he came
in just after you went out, and Emily's
face that was as white as curds before,
turned red to the very roots of her hair; and
when James offered her his hand, she
did not take it to be sure, for that is
quite contrary to all shaker rules and
regulations; but she did not look the
least affronted.
I cannot think, said Ellen, shaking
her head doubtfully, that Emily has
any attachment to James. If she had,
why did she join the shakers? Why!
ah, that's more than I can tell. It
passes
the skill of a rational creature to give
the whys and the wherefores of the
motions of you young girls. I would
as soon undertake to give a reason for
the shiftings of the wind. But I am
as sure that Emily Allen would rather
stay with James, than to go back to the
shakers, as that I know a southerly
breeze from a northwester. But,
Miss Deborah, asked Ellen, apparently
still incredulous, was there any thing
said that would warrant your
conclusion
?
Yes, a good deal was said, but very
low, and I scarcely heard any thing.
But I did, however, hear James say,
`Oh, Emily, how can you bear to think
of all poor Edward felt for you, and of
your old grandmother, for it will
certainly
kill her, and go back again to
those people?' mind you he did not say
a word about himself, but he looked
enough, and I am sure Emily
understood
him, for girls are quick enough at
taking such ideas, and I saw the tears
gush from her eyes; and she said, `it is
a great cross, James, but I must bear
it.' Susan saw as much as I did, for
she seemed as uneasy as a bird when a
boy is robbing her nest. And she got
up and told Emily in her calm way, to
go with her to the kitchen fire. And
Emily followed her, and she will follow
her home, though with a heavy heart in
her bosom.
`, But, said Ellen, Emily shall not
go against her inclination.
Ah there is the rub, replied Debby.
Susan has that in her that she can make
people a mind to do what they would
hate to do for anybody else. I don't
know what it is, she is not a stern woman,
but it is a kind of nat'ral authority, as if
she was a born-queen.
She is very good, certainly, said
Ellen as if trying to discover the secret
of Susan's power.
There it is, replied Debby, there
is no getting such a grapple upon young
folks' hearts, without goodness. But
come, Ellen, there is no use in our
standing
here paraphrasing the matter, do
you go to bed and I'll wait till this old
vulture has done eating, and see them
off, and then go back to the traveller's
room; the laudanum has put him to
sleep at last, and that is the best thing
for him.
Ellen assured Deborah, that she would
comply with her wishes, after having
made one effort to detain Emily.
Deborah
commended her zeal, but was quite
hopeless of success. Ellen said, that if
she could not persuade her to remain with
them now, she might suggest some
considerations
that might weigh with her
afterwards. Debby thought that
looked
rational; but there was no
calculating
with certainty upon such a feeble
piece; if Emily's head had been as
strong as her heart, she would never
have been led away by such fooleries.
Sanguine hope is the privilege of the
young; and Ellen began her
expostulations
with her ardour unimpaired by
Debby's suggestions. She appealed to
Emily's reason, and to her feelings for
a long time, without producing any
sensible
effect. Both Susan and Emily
sate in a fixed posture, with their eyes
rivetted on the floor. At last the poor
girl, unable any longer to smother the
voice of nature, sobbed out, what
shall I do? what ought I to do?
Resist to the death, exclaimed
Susan, in a voice of authority. It is a
strong temptation, child, but there is a
way of escape. Come, Reuben, she
added, turning to Harrington, we
cannot
tarry here in safety any longer.
I am ready to depart, he replied,
for my deeaying nature is greatly
refreshed
by this carnal food. I feared before I
took it, that, as the angel said to the
prophet Elijah, my journey had been too
great for me.
That is a small matter, said Susan;
and then added in a lower tone, Reuben,
the child's soul is at stake: and she
followed him to the door, apparently to
hasten his preparations. Ellen availed
herself of this moment to ask Emily, at
the same time placing her hand on the
latch of the door that led into the
apartment
of the deceased, if she would not
once more look upon her brother?
Oh, yes, said she, and for the first
time instinctively obeying the impulse of
her feelings, she darted through the
door: Ellen closed it after her without
VOL. I. H
following; believing that at this moment,
it was best to leave her to the unassisted
workings of her natural affections. But
Susan, as soon as she returned from
laying
her injunctions on Reuben's reading
what Ellen most wished, went to the
door, and said as calmly as she was able,
for her fears were increased by seeing
James Lenox standing beside Emily,
and eagerly addressing her, Come, my
child, we wait for you, be not like a silly
dove without heart; take up your cross
again, a full cross though it may be, and
turn your back upon the world. Emily,
after a short struggle, obeyed, but with
evident reluctance. It was manifest
that the cords which bound her were
relaxed
,
though not broken. Young
Lenox followed her to the door, and
unobserved
even by Susan's watchful eye,
he thrust a paper into her hand, which,
without examining or offering to return
it, she slipped into her bosom. A person of
ordinary sagacity might have predicted,
that from this moment the charm of the
eldest sister's power was dissolved, and
that though accident and habit, and the
natural submission of weakness,
intellectual
or physical, to power, might detain
the youthful disciple in thraldom, it
would no longer be the service of a
willing
heart. Emily took an affectionate
leave of Ellen; and Susan, after having
simply said, Farewell, turned and
added, you meant well, Ellen  I
know you meant well; but you have
the voice of a charmer, and how should
I be justified if I suffered this young
child to be seduced from her obedience
to the gospel?
Promise me, at least, said Ellen,
that you will not constrain Emily to
remain among you; promise me that
you will suffer her to see and hear from
her friends.
Ellen, replied Susan, in a tone of
solemnity bordering on displeasure,
we have neither dungeons, bolts, nor
H 2
chains. We care not for the poor
service
of the perishing body; but we
would bring all into the obedience of
the spirit; and, she concluded, looking
at Emily with tearful eyes, we would
keep them there, if watching and
praying
can keep them: we have no other
means.
You promise then, what I ask?
I tell you, Ellen, she replied,
I need not promise. Emily is as free
as I amas you are.
God grant that she may be, said
Ellen, in a suppressed voice; and
perceiving
that she could gain nothing
farther from the impracticable
enthusiast
,
she relinquished her hand, which
in her eagerness she had taken, and once
more bidding farewell, they parted. The
waggon drove away, and Ellen went to
her own apartment, of which she would
have been glad now to have been the
sole tenant. She had been too much
disturbed by the suffering of those she
loved, to be able to compose herself to
sleep; and she sate down by an eastern
window, to ponder on the various
feelings
of the heterogeneous group of
mourners that Edward's death had
brought together.
Oh, thought she, as she gazed at
the fair stars in their quiet and orderly
courses, and then at the clear still lake
in whose depths their beautiful images
seemed to sleep: why is it that all
nature
above us, and around is harmony,
while we are left to such conflicts. The
material world is performing the will of
its Creator; the glorious sun is ever on
its way, shining on the just and the
unjust
;
the obedient planets roll on in their
appointed paths; the clouds distil their
nourishing waters, and the winds are
his
messengers as they pass, stirring the
leaves, and waving the ripening
harvest
.
Ellen's reflections might have
led her to a solution of the mystery,
satisfactory
to herself at least, but their
chain was broken by an exclamation
from Miss Redwood, who waking
suddenly
,
exclaimed, good heavens, Miss
what's your name, are you up already?
do be good enough to go to bed again
I can never sleep when any one is
hazing about my room; and close the
blind if you please, the light disturbs
me.
Ellen smiled, but not thinking it
important
to explain the cause of her
being
up at an hour that Miss Redwood
deemed so unseasonable, she let fall a
neatly woven rush curtain, which
sufficiently
excluded the intrusion of the
approaching day; and, laying herself
on her bed, she was soon in a sleep that
Miss Redwood might have envied.
CHAPTER VI.

Cowper
.
Doctor Bristol
called on his
patient
the succeeding day; he found him
feverish, and petulant in spite of his
habitual politeness; he complained that
the opiate had not been powerful
enough. He anticipated a long delay;
he was used to disappointment, and for
himself could bear it; but he dreaded to
encounter his daughter's impatience.
Doctor Bristol understood too well the
arts of his vocation, he was too
sagacious
a practitioner, not to have observed
that a skilful application to the mind is
often a surer remedy than any favourite
or fashionable drug. He accounted
satisfactorily
to Mr. Redwood for the
increase
of fever; he detected and brought
to light many favourable symptoms;
spoke of a ball which was to be given in
the village, and intimated that some of
the most respectable inhabitants would
wait on Miss Redwood, and deem
themselves
honoured by her presence. He
produced some late newspapers which
he had procured at the post-office; the
last foreign reviews; and succeeded in
producing as sudden a change of
symptoms
as an empiric would have
promised
.
Mr. Redwood described the
extraordinary
scene he had witnessed during
the night; asked many questions, and
with particular interest in relation to
the young lady whose face and
demeanour
had impressed him as belonging to
an elevated sphere. Doctor Bristol
assured
him, that his sagacity was not at
fault, for Miss Bruce (the young lady
in question) was not a member of the
Lenox family, but a stranger at Eton,
and a friend of the Allens. Mr.
Redwood
said that the various modes of
religious
superstition always interested
him; he was amused with seeing how
willing man was to be the dupe of his own
inventions; and intimating, that in the
eye of experience and enlightened
observation
,
all the forms of religious faith
were equally absurd; shackles which
men imposed, or wore, from tyranny or
imbecility, he concluded by insinuating
a compliment upon the free-thinking
which was so common among the
enlightened
of the doctor's profession.
Doctor Bristol, without assuming the
attitude of combat, or seeming entirely
to comprehend the drift of Mr.
Redwood's
remarks, observed, that there
were, in his fraternity, some distinguished
exceptions to the charge which had
been laid against them. Every one
acknowledged
the authority of Boerhaave's
H 3
name, and our own Rush, he said,
(speaking with honourable pride of his
master,) is among the most humane
and enlightened of philosophers, and
the most humble of Christians. Mr
Redwood perceived that he had not
proceeded
with his usual tact; that he had
presumed too far upon what he considered
the necessary result of Doctor Bristol's
general intelligence. He avoided any
farther remarks which might have a
tendency to disclose his own sentiments,
and confined himself to comments on
the persons he had observed the
preceding
night. He said he hardly knew
whether the opinions of those people
seemed to him most ridiculous or
shocking
.
Truly, he knew not which most
to pity; the poor old woman who
fancied
a silly girl must lose all chance of
salvation, because forsooth, she had
forsaken
the world, and in good faith
joined a gloomy and self-denying order;
or her child, the shaking quaker who
had immolated every right and natural
affection to an imaginary duty; who
had forsaken all that made life a
blessing
,
to follow an ignorant fanatic, or
an impudent impostor. The doctor
acknowledged
that such mistakes were
lamentable; the result of limited
knowledge
,
or accidental prejudices. Still,
he thought, that while we lamented the
errors to which we were liable, we
might rejoice that the light we enjoyed
was light from heaven, though its
clearness
must depend somewhat on the
purity
of the atmosphere into which it was
introduced; the mists of ignorance might
dim, but did not extinguish its pure ray.
If an immortal hope led these people to
some unnecessary sacrifices, it stimulated
them to those that were necessary; for
he believed there was no variety of the
Christian faith, however distorted from
the perfection of the original model,
which did not insist on a pure morality.
The doctor invited Mr. Redwood to
observe the state of things about him;
the wise and excellent institutions which
had sprung from the religion of the
pilgrims
;
the intelligence and morality
that pervaded the mass of the people,
which might be said to emanate from the
principle of equality, derived from the
Christian code. He spoke of the
religious
zeal and active benevolence which
pervades our society, which, not
neglecting
the means of moral regeneration
at home, sends its missionaries to the
fearful climate of the east; to the
barbarians
of the south, and to the savages
of our own dangerous wilderness. These
noble efforts were not, as in older
countries
,
supported by the pious zeal of a
few of the bountiful, or the gifts of the
penitent rich, who by a kind of spiritual
commutation, expected to purchase, by
their brilliant charities, the remission of
their sins, but, for the most part, they
were the fruit of the virtuous self-denials
and exertions of the laborious classes of
the community.
Mr. Redwood listened with more
patience than could have been expected
from one who had philosophic
prejudices
;
more inveterate perhaps than
those which spring from the conceit of
ignorance, because they are fortified by
the pride of knowledge, and assume the
form of independent opinions which is
so flattering to our self-love. There was
something too in doctor Bristol's manner
that recommended every sentiment he
uttered; it was so calm, so dispassionate,
there was so much of the serenity of truth
in it. There was no extravagant
statements
;
he did not insist that another
should believe, because he
felt
the truth
of such and such propositions; he did
not enter ino a formal argument, but
intimated the grounds on which his own
opinions had been formed, and permitted
Mr. Redwood to draw his own
conclusions
,
hoping they would be such,
as seemed to him natural and
inevitable
.
Mr. Redwood made minute inquiries
in relation to the Lenox family. He
expressed his surprise and regret, that
they had not thought proper to interfere
and detain by force, if necessary, the
foolish little girl, who he predicted
would soon be sick of her folly. He
was pleased to hear that the doctor, as
well as himself, regarded Deborah as an
amusing original; and he again
intimated
some curiosity in relation to Miss
Bruce, which the doctor either could not,
or did not choose to gratify. He did
not allow the doctor to leave him till
he had requested him to make his visits
as long and as frequent as possible, nor
till he had expressed in the most
flattering
terms, his entire confidence in the
doctor's professional ability.
Miss Redwood entered her father's
room as doctor Bristol left it, to make
her dutiful enquiries which were perhaps
nearly as much a matter of form as the
professional visit of the physician. After
she had gone through the customary
routine of, how he had slept? how
he felt himself, &c. she said, if
you have no objections, papa, I will
take a drive this afternoon to the
village while this funeral is going on
here. Ralph tells me, the injury done
to the carriage yesterday was very
slight, and that he can have it in order
by one o'clock, the hour appointed for
the funeral.
If that is the case, my dear, replied
Mr. Redwood, you will gratify me
if you will forego your ride, and offer
the carriage for the use of the poor old
woman and her young friend: they
have not probably as covenient a mode
of riding, and I am told it is
customary
in New-England for the female
relatives to follow the body to the
grave.
How barbarous! exclaimed Miss
Redwood; but thank fortune there
is no occasion, for Lilly tells me, the
old woman is too sick to go out, and is
just to sit up and hear the sermon and
all that; and so, papa, if you have no
objections I will take the carriage, and
get out of the way: funerals and all that
sort of thing, are so dull and
disagreeable
;
I don't see the use of them.
The poet's doctrine, that sweet are
the uses of adversity, was nearly as
foreign from the father's as the
daughter's
experience: but he perceived that
the good-will of the Lenox family
would be of very material use to them;
and thinking that it might be conciliated
by the deference to their feelings which
would be evinced by Miss Redwood's
presence at the funeral solemnity, he
requested
her to gratify him by deferring
her own inclinations. The request had
too much authority in it to be denied;
and though Miss Redwood thought it
great folly to take the trouble to win
favour which might be purchased, she
did not in the end regret that she had
complied with her father's request, so
much was she amused with the number
and aspect of the crowd which the
occasion
assembled.
The observances of a funeral in a
country town in New-England are quite
primitive; but their simplicity is more
touching than the most pompous
ceremonial
,
for it speaks the language of nature
to natural and universal feelings; and
even to those who are not of that soft
mould that is easily impressed by human
sympathies, and who have only
witnessed
this last scene in the drama of
life in a city, the spectacle of a country
funeral must always be curious. In town,
a funeral procession scarcely attracts
the eye of the boy who is carelessly
trundling his hoop, or flying his kite, and
the busy and the gay bustle past, as if
they cared for none of these things, and
had neither part nor lot in them. But
in the country, where life is not so
plentiful; where each knows his
neighbour
,
the events of his life, and the hope
he may have had in death; the full
import
and terrible significance of this
event is felt. Some will attend a
funeral
,
because they remember a kind
word or deed of the departed, or, it
may be, a kind look that inspired a
personal
interest; some, from respect to
the living; some because it is good to go
to the house of mourning: the old would
not shrink from the admonition they
hear there, and the old take the young
because they ought not to shrink from
it: some like to watch the tears of the
mourners, and some to note there are
no tears. The motives that draw any
crowd together are almost as various as
the persons that compose it. On this
occasion, there was an universal
sentiment
of compassion for the solitary
aged mourner, and of respect for the
memory of the departed. Miss
Redwood
took her statian at one extremity
of the apartment in which the assembly
met. She was arrayed with studied
elegance; Lilly stood on one side of her
chair and a footman in livery on the
other: the body of the deceased was on
the opposite side of the room: next to
it sate Mrs. Allen, and beside her, and
supporting her, Ellen, who, in a simple
white dress, her face beaming with
tender
sympathy, looked like the embodied
spirit of religion. Perhaps beauty is
never more touching than when
exclusively
occupied with the sufferings of
others, it is lit up with that divine
expression
of tender compassion, which, to a
religious imagination, is the peculiar
attribute of an angel's face. Next Ellen
sate Mr. and Mrs. Lenox and their
numerous family, all clad in mourning;
their sad looks suiting well with their
badges of grief. The two youngest
children were placed on a bench at their
parent's feet, and whenever they could
withdraw their eyes from the various
objects that attracted them, they would
peep into their parent's faces, and
catching
the expressive language of sorrow,
fall to crying, till some new object
diverted
their attention. Miss Deborah,
having no part of her own to perform,
acted as mistress of ceremonies. She
spoke, perhaps, oftener and louder than
was necessary, but on the whole, she
conducted her affairs with less official
bustle than is common on such
occasions
.
After having made a clear space
for the clergyman in the centre of the
room, and assigned to others their places,
allotting the arrangement of the
procession
to a gigantic militia Major, who
usually filled that office, she seated
herself
at the foot of the coffin, permitted
a large gray cat that came purring
through the crowd to take its usual
station
in her lap, composed her muscles
to a rigid attention, and motioned to
the clergyman to begin his duty. He
made an affecting exhortation, founded
on the 15th chapter of the Epistle to the
Corinthians. A funeral hymn was sung,
and he then proceeded to close the
services
with a prayer, not however until
Deborah had whispered to him, the
old lady is just spent, be short, Sir: pray
but a breath or two. The aged mourner
had listened without once raising her
eyes, without a sigh or a movement. It
seemed as if time or grief had dried the
fountain of her tears, for not one was
seen on her furrowed cheek. The
services
over, the Major ordered the crowd
to fall back to the right and left, while
the coffin was carried out. His order
was obeyed, (though with somewhat
less of military precision than it was
given,) and the coffin was placed in the
court-yard under the wide spreading
branches of an elm tree. He then
returned
to the door, and in the tone of
military command, desired the mourners
to advance and look at the corpse, and
added a notice to the assembly to come
forward immediately after the mourners
had retired, it being necessary that all
should take their last looks now, as the
lid of the coffin was to be screwed down
before the procession moved: a burst of
grief from the group of mourners
evinced that these commands, given out
as the mere forms of preparation, were
to them the dreadful signal of a final
separation. Mrs. Allen rose from her
chair, but even with Ellen's aid was
unable
to move forward till doctor Bristol,
advancing from the crowd, gave her
the support of his stronger arm. She
then approached the coffin, and bent
for the last time over the body of her
child; her tears, which had been checked
till this moment, now flowed freely;
and as she raised her head, she perceived
they had fallen on Edward's face; she
said nothing, but carefully wiped them
away. She is right, whispered
Doctor
Bristol to Ellen. Edward has
nothing more to do with tears: they are
all
wiped away. Oh, my son,
exclaimed
Mrs. Allen, in a low broken
voice, would to God Emily laid
beside
you; then would I thankfully lay
down my weary body with you.
But, she added, after a moment's
pause, in which her piety struggled
with her nature, God's will be done.
Glad am I to hear those words,
said Debby, who stood near enough to
catch the feeble sounds: the poor old
lady's cup has been brimful of trouble so
long that it would not be strange if she
did think herself something crowded
on.
Crowded onwhat can the woman
mean? asked a young man of his
companion
;
but before the inquirer could
obtain a reply, he was jostled out of his
place by others eagerly pressing
forward
to gaze for the last time on the
face of the deceased. All as they
turned away looked on Mrs. Allen,
and some perhaps wondered that the
leafless scaithed trunk should have been
passed by, and the young sapling cut
down in its prime and beauty. Mrs.
Allen was led back to the house,
attended
by Ellen and doctor Bristol; they
passed through the apartment where
Miss Redwood still maintained her
station, and where she continued to
gaze upon all that passed before her with
the indifference with which she would
have regarded the shifting scenes of a
wearisome play: the Major approached
her, and with awkward but well-meant
civility, told her she would have a good
chance now to look at the corpse, and,
being she was a stranger, he would see
her through the crowd himself
Oh thank you, she replied
disdainfully
,
I have no fancy for looking at
dead people, and certainly I shall not
look at one dead that I never saw living.
The Major, thus rebuffed, turned away,
and meeting Debby, he said in a low
tone, I rather think that young
stranger
girl has got to find out yet that she
is mortal. Why, bless my soul! a
body would think her road did not
lay grave-ward; but young, and
handsome
,
and topping as she is, she must
come to it at last. She is a pretty
creature though to look at, he added,
paying her the tribute of another full
stare; she is almost as handsome as the
wax-work Rode-Island beauty.
Pooh, pooh, replied Debby,
handsome
is that handsome does, and she
glanced her eyes towards Ellen Bruce;
that is my rule, it is an old one, but it
will never wear out.
Miss Debby is right, whispered a
pert girl, with the insolence of youth;
quite right to stick to every thing that
is old.
Yes, yes, replied Debby, who
unluckily
overheard her, quite right, till
there is more reason to hope that the
rising generation will make good the
places of those who have gone before
them.
A call was now given to form the
VOL. I. 1
procession. Mrs. Allen was conducted
by her kind attendants to her own
apartment. The rooms were cleared,
the procession moved away, and the
house was restored to its usual quiet and
order.
CHAPTER VII.
What folly I commit I dedicate to you.
Two Gentlemen of Ferona
.
The
week that followed the funeral
would have been passed by Miss
Redwood
in perfect listlessness, had not Miss
Bruce excited her curiosity, and her
curiosity been stimulated by the
difficulty
of its gratification. The
following
petulant production of her pen, a
letter achieved to her grandmother after
repeated and painful efforts, may afford
a fair view of her feelings. It certainly is
not a favourable specimen of her talents,
for she had originally a strongly marked
character: but abandoned from her
infancy
to the guidance of a doting and
I 2
silly grandmother, and early initiated into
fashionable and frivolous society, with
uncommon
intellectual capacities and strong
passions, she was permitted to devote
herself to every thing that was trifling,
and, in short, condemned to a perpetual
childhood. But no farther remarks shall
be intruded on the just inferences which
the good sense of our readers will enable
them to deduce from the document itself.
My dear grandmamma,I can fancy
your vexation when you receive this
letter; for you, and you alone, can form
an adequate notion of my
disappointments
and present misery. As to papa,
you know he never feels, nor thinks as
you and I do.
No doubt in your imagination I
am figuring in the drawing-rooms of
Boston, displaying those beautiful dresses
you imported for this ill-starred journey;
leading captive my thousands and my
tens of thousands; living in an
atmosphere
of lover's sighs, and on the eve of
breaking a hundred hearts by my
departure
for the Springs, where we expected
that a second harvest of conquest and
glory awaited me. `Now look on that
picture, and on this.' Here I am at a
vulgar farmer's, on the outskirts of a
town called Eton; and so changed am
I, or rather every thing about me is so
changed, that I can scarcely believe that
not much more than one little month
has elapsed since I was parading
Broadway
with Captain Fenwick(by the
way, Broadway is a sublime place for a
real show off,)and he said to me, as
admirer after admirer poured into my
train, `you see Miss Redwood, that you
are the centre of the system,the sun;
and we, your satellites, humbly revolve
around you.' What would he think,
what could he say, if he were to see me
now; not a creature dazzled by my
brightness, though there is not a rival
star in the heavens?but a truce to
lamentations, I will proceed to facts, and
then, dear grandmamma, you will
perceive
how much I deserve and need
your pity. I must begin my relation at
St. John's, where the only pleasant
incident
occurred which this letter will
contain. You will remember that I
wrote you from Montreal the particulars
of my first interview with Captain
Fitzgerald
,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera:
how many delightful gallantries and
flattering speeches are included in these
et ceteras! Speaking of Fitzgerald,
carries
me back to Montreal; and I must
say, en passant, I was shockingly
disappointed
in the size and appearance of
the city, which I expected to find as
large as New-York; and still more
with the military band; for you know,
grandmamma, you always told me that
since the revolution we had never had
any military music fit to be heard. But
to return to our journey. The first
person
I beheld on arriving at St. John's
was Fitzgerald; he had come there, as
he whispered to me, to see me once
more. Papa was very coldalmost
rude to him; but I took care that my
pleasure should be sufficiently apparent
to compensate him for papa's incivility.
It is so strange of papa, when he knows
that Fitzgerald is the son of an earl, and
brother to a Lord; and if he is a little
gay, as papa says he is, dissipation is
universal among military men, and no
fault of theirs of course. I don't see
what good it does papa not to be
religious
,
if he will make such a fuss about
trifles. My dear grandmamma, you would
admire Fitzgerald; and you may have
an opportunity, for he assured me, that
if he could get up a cough that would
furnish a pretext to ask leave of absence,
he would pass the next winter at
Charleston. He hinted at the
possibility
of meeting me at the Springs. I
am ready to die with vexation when I
think of what I may lose by our
detention
in this vile place. It is but little
more than a week, though it seems to
me an age, since we met with the
shocking
accident which has caused our
delay. Immediately on getting into
our own carriage, (the sight of which
was the first thing that revived me after
parting with Fitzgerald,) we were
overtaken
by a tremendous thunder-storm,
which of course almost deprived me of
my senses; the lightning struck a
number
of trees, and the prodigious blaze
that ensued, so terrified the horses, that
they leaped over a precipice forty or
fifty feet high. Fortunately the carriage
was not turned over, owing, I believe,
though I never understood clearly how
it was, to its being caught among the
branches of the trees. I was wild with
fright, and poor Lilly as white as my
handkerchief. As soon as we were
extricated
from our perilous situation, we
took refuge in the nearest farm-house,
glad, at the moment, of any shelter from
the storm. We should have proceeded
the same evening to the village, but
papa had his arm horribly broken in
jumping from the carriage, and here
we were obliged to remain; and here
we have a prospect of passing the
remainder
of papa's life; for strange to tell,
he has put himself into the hands of a
country doctor;
and what is worse, though
he never believed in anything before,
he has taken a freak to place implicit
confidence in this man, whose interest it
is, you know, to detain him here as long
as possible. This papa does not seem
to suspect, clair-voyant, as he prides
himself on being, and aided too by the
light of my hints, which you may be
sure I have not spared. What is most
extraordinary and provoking of all is,
that papa, who was never contented
before in his life, appears as satisfied as
if he had entered elysium; and never
before patient, has suddenly become as
patient as Job.
I 8
There is one solution of the mystery
which I hardly dare to commit to paper,
lest some bird of the air should carry
it to papa.
You must know, grandmamma, there
is a young woman herelady I suppose
I must call herfor to confess the truth,
she has every appearance of being one,
that has inspired papa with the most
surprising admiration from the first
moment that he saw her. I dare not
say he is in love with her: I will
not think it. I should go mad if I
believed it; but he has the most
unaccountable
interest in her. Yesterday I
said to him with as much apparent
carelessness as I could assume, `Lilly
tells me that this Miss Bruce is shortly
to be married.'
`Ah,' said he, starting from one of
his fits of absence, `to whom? where did
Lilly pick up this intelligence?' `From
some of the family; the happy man is
a son of our host's, a young parson.'
`Impossible,' exclaimed papa. `
Impossible
,
Sir,' I echoed, `why so?' The
dear old gentleman was a little flustered
for a moment, and then said, `Miss
Bruce is so superior to this Lenox family,
so intelligent and cultivated;'`but,
papa, you are always crying up these
Lenoxes for such knowing people.'
`They deserve our respect, Miss
Redwood
:
they are excessively
well-informed
,
and clever: but, Caroline, you
must see the disparity between them
and Miss Bruce; it is quite apparent:
the gracefulness of her demeanor, the
uncommon delicacy of her manners, the
very tones of her voice, mark her as
a being of the highest order.' It is a
gone case, thought I; but hiding my
thoughts in the depths of my heart, I
replied, `she has undoubtedly a more
genteel air than these Lenox girls; but
why should she be on intimate terms
with the family, if she has such superior
pretensions?' `I know not,' he
replied
,
pettishly; `there is some tie of
benevolence to the Allens, I believe;
but of course it is a subject which we
cannot with any propriety investigate.'
He then told me he was fatigued, and
would like to be left alone; and as I
came out of the room, he requested me
to send Lilly to him. His reluctance
to investigation was suddenly
vanquished
,
for as I afterwards learned from
Lilly, he questioned, and
cross-questioned
her as to the source and amount
of her intelligence.Heaven grant it
may be true!
I cannot imagine how papa can feel
any interest in this Lenox family: they
are common working vulgar farmers.
There is one oddity among them,
whom they call an `old girl;' a
hideous monstera giantess: I suspect a
descendant of the New-England witches;
and, I verily believe, if the truth was
known, she has spell-bound papa. The
wretch is really quite fond of him; for
him she wrings the necks of her fattest
fowls, and I hear her at this moment
bawling to one of the boys, to kill the
black-eared pig,for him no doubt.
Notwithstanding her devotion to papa,
she does not pay me the least respect,
but lavishes all her favour on Ellen
Bruce. I overheard her this morning
saying to Mrs. Lenox, that Ellen was
as much of a lady as that
Caroliny gal
,
with all her flaunting ruffles and
folderols
.
Ellen, she said, had been brought
up to business; but as to that useless
piece, she could neither act nor transact.
She says too, that, rather than have a
fellow-
creter
tag round after her, as Lilly
does after me, she would turn wild Indian.
Only think, dear grandmamma, of
my being obliged to hear such rude
things said without notice or
resentment
,
for papa is very angry if I betray,
in the slightest degree, my contempt and
detestation of these people and their
ways; even if I ridicule them, he quotes
to me a wise old saw of Csar's, or
somebody's, that, `He that condemns
rusticity is himself a rustic.' In heaven's
name, of what use is rank or fortune, if
it does not make you independent of
such animals!
In every respect this place is
disagreeable
to me. It fatigues me to
death to see the family labour: labour,
as you often say, grandmamma, was made
for slaves, and slaves for labour; but
here they toil on as if it was a pleasure.
They have an immense farm, as they
call their plantation, and but two
servants
,
(one a negro) or as they call
them,
helps;
and well are they thus
named, for they do no more work than
the rest of the family; and what
provokes
me more than all, is, that these
servants read and write, and are taught
arithmetic, and the Lord knows what
all, and Lilly and Ralph have this
dreadful
example before them. But the
most ridiculous thing is, the fuss these
people make about
learning
, as they call
all sorts of knowledge; one would think
it was the philosopher's stone, by the
pains they take to get it. After the
girls `have done up their work, and put
every thing to rights,' (this is their
jargon
)
they walk twice in a week, a
mile and a half to the village to hear a
man lecture on botany. I am sure you
would expire with laughter, to see their
boors of brothers come from their work
in the fields laden with flowers for their
sisters to analyse, or preserve in their
herbariums. There is a village library,
and as much eagerness for the dull
histories
and travels it contains, as you and
I ever felt to get a new novel into our
possession. As to novels, there is no
such thing as obtaining one, unless
it be some of Miss Edgeworth's, which
scarcely deserve the name of novels.
If I could but sleep as we used to
in the country, and the country, as
far as I can see was made for
nothing
else, I could contrive to get rid of
some more of my time; but the air on
the lake-shore is so bracing, that for my
life I cannot sleep more than nine or
ten hours. These people are excessively
civil to papa; but they seem to think
they have a right to place themselves
on an equality with me, and the more
haughty my manners, the less attention
they pay to me. Papa reads me long
lectures about availing myself of this
opportunity of studying human nature,
and observing the different conditions
of human life. Is it not unreasonable
to expect me to care about such things?
and if I did, I should as soon think of
taking Robinson Crusoe's desert island for
a study as this place. All of human life
that I ever wish to see is limited to the
drawing-room, the ball-room, and the
other haunts of the beau monde. I should
certainly die of ennui, if it were not
that this Ellen Bruce excites my
curiosity
to such a degree: who can she
be? I suspect that she is a natural child
of somebody's, for whenever I have
asked any questions about her
connexions
,
she is evidently troubled, and
the people of the house affect to be quite
ignorant of her parentage, and in reply
to my inquiries, simply say, that she
came from a distant part of the country:
she is here with an old woman by the
name of Allen, to whom she is devoted:
she is an intimate friend of Mrs. Lenox,
and not a relation of either; and to
confess the truth, she is, as papa says, of
an order quite superior to them. She is
an orphan, and without fortune: so much
the Lenoxes have condescended to tell
me; without fortune, and yet her dress
is of the finest materials; not exactly
fashionable, as I said to papa: he
replied
,
with some truth I must allow,
`but a model for fashion, Caroline.'
One circumstance has excited my
curiosity particularly: she rises every
morning at the dawn of day, and sallies
out, and does not return till the old
woman is ready to rise, which is our
breakfast hour, (papa's and mine;) and
then papa, from great consideration for
the trouble of the Lenoxes, begs Miss
Bruce will do us the favour to sit at our
table. On these occasions she departs
from her customary pensive style, her
complexion usually of the pale order, is
quite brilliant, and her manner and
conversation
animated. Papa, very
innocently
,
imputes all this to the benefit
of morning exercise, and I as innocently
on one occasion proposed to be her
companion, an honour she politely
declined
without assigning any reason,
though she has repeatedly offered to
show me the pleasant walks in the
neighbourhood
.
She expresses the greatest
impatience
to have Mrs. Allen well enough to
return to her own residence; but this I
think is mere affectation; and in this
guessing, calculating, concluding
country
,
I have come to the conclusion, that
if heaven does not speed the old
woman's
recovery, or the Lenox match, or
some other insuperable obstacle, she and
papa will get up a sentimental affair of
it. A sentimental affair! papa fifty,
and Miss Bruce nineteen or twenty:
stranger things have happenedyou
remember
my two old fools of lovers who
were well nigh fifty; they, it is true,
were neither sick nor dull like papa;
but then Miss Bruce has neither fortune
nor beauty; at least I am sure
you
would
not call her beautiful who can she be,
grandmamma? Papa says she has received
a first-rate education; but that is
according
to his queer old-fashioned notions.
She plays upon no instrument, and is
not fond of dancing; of course you
know she cannot dance well. As to
French she does not speak it all, though
papa says she is quite familiar with
French and Italian authors, and she and
papa talk over Racine and Ariosto and
the Lord knows what all, at our
interesting
djeuners, which I am resolved
to break up as soon as I have ascertained
the object of the long morning walks
that precede them. Write to me, dear
grandmamma, and direct to this place,
and do not fail to let me know whether
papa has the control of my fortune, so
that if I should marry contrary to his
wishes, he could deprive me of it: and
pray ask Le Moine, whether the blue
trimming was intended for the white or
the brown dress; Lilly has forgotten,
and I am quite at a loss about it. By
the way, if poor Sarah should die as you
expect before I return, don't mention it
in your letters, for I want a good
excuse
for not putting on blackwhich
would be horrible; as Maria Crayton
says, there is not a mantua-maker in
New-England that can make a dress fit
for a Christian to wear, and besides you
know one can have no variety in black.
I cannot imagine where Miss Bruce has
her dresses made; they are plain enough,
but they sit exquisitely. Farewell, dear
grandmamma, I shall give you the
earliest
notice of any discoveries I may make.
Postscript.Thank heaven! papa
has just given me leave to write to Mrs.
Westall to come to Eton with Charles,
so that I have a prospect of seeing two
civilized beings, who will probably
think me quite equal to this prodigy,
Ellen Bruce: and I do not despair of
finding a tolerable beau,
pro tem.
in
Charles Westall; though I think he
will scarcely drive Fitzgerald out of
my head and heart.
As curiosity is in its nature infectious,
our readers may possibly have caught
Miss Redwood's desire to know
something
more of Ellen Bruce's history than
has yet been disclosed to them, and to
gratify this inclination, they may be
willing to attend to a sketch of some
other persons, with whose history hers
is necessarily interwoven.
Justyn Allen, the father of Emily
and Edward, was born in Connecticut,
whence while a minor he emigrated
with his father's family to the state of
New-York. There he and all the rest
of the family, with the exception of his
mother, were, for a short time, under
the dominion of Ann Lee, the founder
of the shaker society: by the charitable
deemed an enthusiastby those of
severer
judgment, an impostor. At her first
appearance in this country, she made
many converts from among the
respectable
class of farmers. Her dominion,
however, over the Allen family, was of
short duration, and after a few weeks of
wild fanaticism, the father and children
returned to the half-distracted mother,
to lament or deride their delusion. Susan
Allen, the youngest child, alone
remained
constant to her new faith, which
she had been the last to adopt, and
which had been endeared to her by
difficult sacrifices. Justyn Allen as he
was preparing, according to the uniform
custom of our unportioned young farmers,
to seek his fortunes in the west, received
the intelligence of the death of a bachelor
uncle who had resided within forty miles
of Boston, in a beautiful village, which
we shall take the liberty to call
Lansdown
.
This uncle had bequeathed to
Allen a valuable farm and all the
appurtenances
thereunto belonging. He
hastened to take possession of it; and
to complete his happiness he married a
well-educated and exemplary young
woman from his native state. Five
years after their marriage, Mrs. Allen
returned from a short visit to
Connecticut
,
bringing with her an infant girl,
the child, as she said, of a young friend
of hers who had died within the first
year of her marriage, and had
bequeathed
the child to her. There was no
improbability in the story; and as no
one in Lansdown knew Mrs. Allen's
early connections, the busy questioning
spirit of village curiosity was not
excited
to inquiry or suspicion. Mrs. Allen
was a woman who walked straight
forward
in the direct line of dutysimple
in her manners, and ingenuous in her
conduct; there was nothing about her
to invite curiosity. It was observed
that she loved the child tenderly; but
that was natural; for besides that she
was a most lovely little creature, she
came to Mrs. Allen before she had
children
of her own to occupy her maternal
affections. From the time the child,
who had received the name of Ellen,
could comprehend anything, Mrs. Allen
had been in the habit of talking to her
of her mother. But in spite of her
efforts it was always in a sad tone; and
once the child interrupted her to ask,
was not my mother good? Yes,
my love, perfectly good. Well, then,
is she not glad to be in such a place as
heaven? Yes, I believe so. You
need not look so sorry then, when you
are talking about her.
Mrs. Allen felt the propriety of the
child's rebuke; but besides that it is
always grievous to see a bud so early torn
from its parent stock, there were bitter
recollections associated with the memory
of Ellen's mother, and especially with her
death, that clouded Mrs. Allen's brow
whenever she spoke of her. She did
however, in compliance with the last
injunction of the unfortunate mother,
faithfully endeavour to inspire the child
with a love for herto make hope take
the place of memory; and by constantly
cherishing the expectation of a reunion to
her mother, she preserved in its strength
the filial bond. It is only when our
human
affections are consecrated by a
belief
in their perpetuity, that they can have
their perfect influence on the character.
VOL. I. K
Ellen experienced the holy ministration
of which they are capable from her
earliest years. Before she reasoned, she
felt a relation to heaven; her affections
were set on things above. This shielded
her innocence, and gave a tenderness
and elevation to her character, as if the
terrestrial had already put on the
celestial
.
The natural gaiety of childhood,
though sometimes intermitted, was not
impaired. Her eyes, it is true, were
tearful while she sate on her little bench
at Mrs. Allen's feet, and listened to
the stories of her mother; but the next
moment she was playing with her
kitten
,
or bounding away in pursuit of a
butterflyso natural is it for the opening
flower to shrink from a chilling
influence
,
and expand to the sun beams.
Ellen had been told by Mrs. Allen
that she had no father; and whenever
the child's interest was excited about him,
(which was not often, as Mrs. Allen
studiously avoided all mention of him,)
the answers to her inquiries were
discreetly
framed to lull her curiosity,
without communicating the least
information
.
The impression she received
was that he had died at nearly the same
time with her mother.
Her childhood glided on to her fifth
year, bright as a cloudless morning,
when an event occurred that produced a
great sensation in Lansdown, and
materially
affected the character and destiny
of our heroine.
There was an estate adjoining Allen's,
which from time immemorial, (a period
that in our young country may mean
half a century) had belonged to the
Harrisons, a family residing in Boston.
It had the usual fate of the property of
absenteesthe house was out of repair,
the fences in a ruinous condition, and
the land from year to year depreciating
from unfaithful husbandry.
Allen had gone on in the usual way,
buying more cattle to graze his land,
K 2
and more land to feed his cattle, till
smitten with a desire to enlarge his
territory
,
(the ruling passion of our farmers,
each one of whom is said to covet all
the land adjoining his own,) he cast his
longing eyes on the Harrison farm, and
easily persuaded himself there were good
reasons in the nature of things why it
should be united to his own. Both
farms lay at the distance of half a mile
from the village. Allen's was on an
eminence, and divided from the
Harrison
estate by a small stream, whose
annual overflowing enriched the lowlands
of his neighbour without reaching to
the elevation of his; with every rain
the cream of his soil trickled down
to his neighbour's, and the droughts that
seared his fields left his neighbour's
smiling in their verdant prosperity.
Still the hand of the diligent, busy on
Allen's farm, amply compensated for
this natural disparity; and when he
realized the profits of his labour and
thriftiness, his hankering after the
facilities
of the adjoining property increased
to such a degree, that he sent to the
proprietor a proposition for the
purchase
of it, by one of his townsmen, a
member of the state legislature. Mr.
Robert Harrison, the representative of
his family, received the proposition with
indignation, and failed not to express
his surprise that any one should presume
to think he would part with a family
estate. The honourable member, who
was one of the numerous Cincinatusses
of our country, called from the plough
to patriotic duties, felt his new-made
honours touched by this reflection on
one of his constituents, and he replied, as
to `family estate, that was an old joke,
that one family was as good as another
now-a-days, and that for his part,
he must say it was his humble opinion
that no family could be any honour to
an estate, and no estate to a family,
when it was left in such a condition as
the Harrison farm at Lansdown.' The
member's humble opinion stung the
family
pride of Mr. Robert Harrison;
and from that moment he meditated a
removal to the neglected farm, which,
in the pride of his heart, he loved to call
the family estate. Many circumstances
strengthened his resolution. At the
breaking out of the revolutionary war,
Robert Harrison had just attained his
majority, and entered into the possession
of a large fortune, with the expectation
of succeeding to the honours of the
provincial
government, which his father
had always enjoyed. Robert Harrison
was allied to some noble families in the
mother country, an important
circumstance
in the estimation of the untitled
gentry of the colony. Possessing
fortune
,
the favours of the government,
and the distinctions of rank, and priding
himself on the unstained loyalty of his
ancestors, young Harrison naturally
sided with the tory party. He had
every thing to lose, and nothing to gain
for himself from a change of
government
;
and as to the rights of the
people
,
which were the subject of contest,
he held them in too great contempt to
acknowledge they had any rights.
Harrison
,
however blind he might be to the
principle of natural justice, was soon
obliged to feel that might makes
right, and he, with many other staunch
friends of the government, in danger of
being swept away by the tide of
republicanism
,
sought a shelter in the mother
country. There he soon after married
a young lady, a Bostonian by birth,
who had been sent home, according to
the fashion of the most wealthy gentry
in the colony, for her education.
Similarity
of opinion and of fortunes had
united Robert Harrison to her father's
family, and governed more by the
accidents
of their condition, than by any
congeniality of character, she married
him. Mrs. Harrison, from the age of
thirteen to nineteen, immured in a
boarding-school, came forth from it as
ignorant of the motley mass called the
world, as if she had been bred in a
convent
.
Happily, her education had been
conducted by a superior woman, who,
proud of her pupil's extraordinary powers,
had added to the common routine of
boarding-school accomplishments
judicious
intellectual cultivation: so that even
at this period, when a well-informed
woman is neither a monster nor a
prodigy
,
Mrs. Harrison would have been
distinguished for her mental
attainments
.
The exact habits of her school
had given a preciseness to her manners,
that veiled the warmth of her feelings,
but never was there a more generous
and tender spirit than she possessed.
Robert Harrison had a fine
appearance
and engaging manners; he was the
object of her parent's partiality, and the
first suitor for her favour: and viewing
him through the prismatic medium of
romantic expectation and youthful fancy,
it was not strange that she loved, or
believed she loved him. Perhaps she
was not herself conscious of the capacity
of her affections, till the energies of
maternal
love were awakened by the birth
of a child. This child, a girl, lived but
five years, and when she died, her
mother
resigned her as she would have
done her own soul if it had been
demanded
,
with unquestioning faith in the
wisdom of the dispensation. But she
never recovered her former spirits,
though her mind, too active to remain
the passive prey of grief, still pressed
forward in the pursuit of some new
attainment
.
She seemed to love
knowledge
for its own sake; her husband
took no part nor interest in her pursuits,
and as to the gratification of vanity in
display, for that she had neither
opportunity
nor inclination.
The family remained in England till
the peace in 1783, when they returned
K 3
to this country, with their English
affections
and prejudices strengthened by
habit, and endeared by the privations
they had suffered on account of their
loyalty. Mr. Harrison claimed his
patrimonial
estate, and found, to his bitter
disappointment, that those persons who
had been designated by name in the act
of confiscation were excepted in the
repeal
of that act, and it was not his least
mortification in finding himself one of
this unfortunate number, that his
property
had gone to the support of a cause
which he detested. The estate at
Lansdown
,his
household furniture and
plate, and some personal property, he
saved from the wreck of his fortune.
This was a small portion of his rich
inheritance
,
but skilfully managed by the
domestic talents of Mrs. Harrison, it
was sufficient for the limited expenses
of a small establishment. The
meanness
of his fallen fortunes did not at all
degrade his rank in his native town, for
if some portions of our country must
sustain the reproach of paying undue
deference to the vulgar aristocracy of
wealth, that part of it has always been
exempt from this common fault of a
commercial country. Neither did his
English feelings render him less
acceptable
in the society of Boston; the first
to prove a rebel child, she never lost in
her resistance of authority, her love for
the parent land.
But Mr. Harrison had not
magnanimity
of mind to enjoy the advantages
that remained to him. He was
perpetually
harassed by seeing those who
had been distinguished in their country's
service, or diligent in the avenues of
business which had been recently opened,
arriving at wealth and honours which
he looked upon as the exclusive right
the birthright of the higher orders. The
higher orders had sunk to the uniform
level of republicanism, to what Mr.
Harrison
was fond of calling, a church-yard
equality; there even he was hardly
willing the high and the low, the rich
and the poor, should meet together.
Not all the courtesies and kindness of a
cultivated and virtuous society could
compensate Mr. Harrison for the
mortification
of seeing the mansion-house of
his family in the possession of one of the
mushroom gentryan appellation he
freely bestowed on every name not
noted under the provincial government,
and entitled to no more credit or honour
in his eyes, than a parchment deed
without
the crown stamp.
The years rolled heavily on; Mrs.
Harrison's parents had been gathered to
their fathers, and independent in her
pursuits, and active in her habits, her
life passed without discontent or ennui.
When her husband proposed their
removal
to Landsdown, she acquiesced
willingly
,
in the hope that he would become
interested in the little concerns of his
farm, and forget the trifling vexations
that in Boston disturbed his peace.
Confirmed in his wishes by his wife,
who exercised a discreet, and therefore
an insensible influence over him, Mr.
Harrison vested his property in an annuity
in the British funds, and removed to
Lansdown. This new arrangement of
his pecuniary affairs afforded him a
larger income than he had enjoyed for
a long time, and enabled him to
restore
the place at Lansdown to its
primitive order and dignity, The house
was newly painted, the fences rebuilt,
and the garden re-stocked with fruit trees
and plants.
Mrs. Harrison gently remonstrated
against the removal of the antique and
ponderous furniture, and even hazarded
the profane suggestion that it would be
wise to dispose of it at auction, and to
procure that which would be more
adapted to their present fortune, and in
better keeping with the simplicity of
country life, and which would neither
expose them to the sneers nor envy of
their neighbours.
Neighbours! replied the irritated
husband, I wish you to understand once
for all, Mrs. Harrison, that I mean to
have no neighbours. The people of
Lansdown remember the habits of the
family too well to presume to associate
with us. As to the furniture, I have
made up my mind about that, and you
know my mind, once made up, is not
given to change; therefore, Mrs.
Harrison
,
you will be so good as to order
every article of our furniture, large and
small, to be packed up with the greatest
possible care. Mrs. Harrison
reserved
all her opposition to her husband
for matters that she deemed
important
;
the furniture was packed and
arranged at Lansdown with her best
skill: and there Mr. Harrison surveyed,
with infinite complacency, the turkey
carpets, damask curtains and sofa, the
cumbrous mahogany chairs, and family
plate studiously arranged in an old
fashioned buffet with glass doors, and
the loyal garnishing of the walls
decorated
with approved likenesses of their
majesties and their hopeful offspring,
and with proof prints of the royal parks
and palaces. Mrs. Harrison, though
she could not but smile at this parade
of the relics of their departed wealth
and grandeur, took a benevolent
pleasure
in ministering to the gratification of
her husband; and when she left him in
the parlour still gazing on the memorials
of patrimonial splendour, and retired to
arrange in a small apartment adjoining
her bed-room (in which were her books
and drawing materials) some choice or
favourite plants: `we must both,'
she thought, `have our playthings. If
you had lived, my sweet Mary,' she
said, turning her eye on a beautiful
picture
of her child that hung at the foot
of her bed, `we might have had some
occupation that would have saved us
from thus prolonging our childhood.'
Her attention was attracted by the
sound of a light footstep, and a beautiful
little girl entered her apartment with a
basket of fine early peaches, which she
timidly offered to Mrs. Harrison, with
Mrs. Allen's respects. Mrs. Harrison's
mind was at this moment filled with
the image of her child, and she saw, or
fancied she saw, a striking resemblance
between the portrait and the little
stranger. She looked from one to the
other; the eyes were of the same deep
blue, there was the same peculiar, and,
as she thought, heavenly grace of the
mouth; the hair too, a light and bright
brown, fell in the same natural curls
over her neck and shoulders. Oh,
my own, dear Mary, she exclaimed,
as she placed the child on her lap, and
gazed on her, I can almost fancy you
are again in my arms; and yet, she
added, as the tears gushed from her
eyes, she has not quite that look my
Mary had. Ellen Bruce, (for it was
she) after looking in silent amazement
for a few moments at Mrs. Harrison
said, I wish I was your Mary, and
then you would not be so sorry.
Sweet child, exclaimed Mrs.
Harrison
,
wiping away her tears, and
smiling on her, and who are you
who is your mother?
Oh, I don't live with my mother,
she lives in heaven, Mrs. Allen says.
Who then do you live with, my
love?
I live with our little Emily's mother.
And who is she?
Why, Mrs. Allen; did not you
know that she had little twin babies?
No, my dear child; but if you will
show me the way to Mrs. Allen's, I will
go with you and see her: so saying,
she threw on her hat and shawl, and
was descending the stairs with the little
girl, when she met her husband in quest
of her. My dear, said he snapping
his fingers, and speaking in an unusually
animated tone, here is an English
paperand glorious news. The
English
have gained a complete victory:
thank God! that cowardly rascal
Bonaparte
is beaten at last.
I am glad of it, replied Mrs.
Harrison
,
turning from him to pursue her
first intention.
Glad of it! Pshaw, is that allwhat
is the matterwhere are you going?
here are all the particulars; the number
engaged, the names of the officers, a
list of the killed, wounded, and prisoners:
every thing most satisfactory; none
of your lying French bulletins, but
Englishfair John Bull style; every
word truetrue as the gospel.
I am very glad of it, repeated
Mrs. Harrison, I will read it the
moment
I return from leading this little
girl home; she has brought us some
delicious peaches from one of our
neighbours
.
Send one of the servants with her;
I am impatient to hear you read these
accounts; there are many private letters
from the officers that were in the action,
and besides, he added, lowering his
voice, the people about us are quite
too much inclined to familiarity already.
I do not wish you to encourage them.
Here Betsy, he vociferated to the
servant
girl, lead this child home. Mrs.
Harrison led Ellen to the door, and
kissing, and begging her to come again
to see her, she transferred her to the
care of the servant, and returned to
soothe her husband with all the interest
she could command in the details of the
victory.
Ellen Bruce had received such
various
and confused impressions during her
short visit to the mansion-house, that
she was unable to give a clear report
of it to Mrs. Allen: and as the child
brought no word of acknowledgment
for the peaches, Mrs. Allen naturally
concluded that her first neighbourly
overtures were unkindly taken: her
husband completed her mortification by
asking her, how she could make such
a mistake as to suppose that the duke (a
title already bestowed on Mr. Harrison
by his republican neighbours) could eat
fruit that did not grow on the `family
estate?'
Mrs. Allen, with all her good sense,
was not quite free from the jealous pride
that pervades her class in New-England:
she resolved not to waste her courtesies
upon those who disdained them; and
when Ellen, calling to mind Mrs.
Harrison's
invitation to her, begged leave
to carry her some more peaches, Mrs.
Allen said, no! if the peaches were
worth sending, they were worth
thanking
for. Ellen rather felt than
understood
the reply, and she answered, but
I am sure the lady spoke very kind to
me.
Ay, yes my dear, that is an easy
matter, every body speaks kind to
you;
it is not necessary to force you upon
any one's notice: when Mrs. Harrison
sends for you it will be time enough for
you to go to her. Ellen had no
purpose
of disobedience, but surprised at
the unwonted strictness of Mrs. Allen,
she determined to lay aside all the
peaches that were given to her for the
lady whose kind manner to her had
made a deep impression.
In the meantime, Mrs. Harrison
possessed
herself of all that was known, in
the village, of Ellen Bruce's brief
history
;
and the whole amount of it was
that she was the orphan child of a friend
of Mrs. Allen's, and had been adopted
in her infancy, by that excellent woman,
and treated with maternal kindness.
`Oh, had providence destined her to my
protection, what a solace, what a delight
she would have been to me,' thought
Mrs. Harrison: `and even now, could
I persuade my husband to indulge me in
going to the Allens, I might obtain this
little creature to lighten some of my
heavy hours.' She determined to watch
for some propitious moment before she
ventured to explain her wishes: a happy
accident might throw the child again in
her way, and such an accident she
thought had occurred, when, a few days
after the first interview, as she was
walking with her husband past Mrs.
Allen's, she saw the child come
bounding
towards her with her apron full of
peaches.
Oh, how glad I am, said she, on
coming up to Mrs. Harrison, her eyes
sparkling, and her cheeks glowing;
here, take them all, they are mine,
and I saved them all for you. For
me, replied Mrs. Harrison, kissing her,
and for this gentleman.
For the Duke! oh no, replied
little Ellen, with fatal simplicity; Mr.
Allen says the duke will not eat our
peaches.
What, exclaimed Mr. Harrison,
does the little impudent baggage mean
by calling me the duke?
Every body calls him that name,
said Ellen, lowering her voice, and
drawing closer to Mrs. Harrison.
Never mind, my love, whispered
Mrs. Harrisson, while she kissed her,
run home, and do come very soon to
see me. Then turning to her husband
she said, I declare our neighbours are
half right; you have quite a look of
nobility
,
my dear husband; you might pass
in more knowing eyes than theirs for a
peer of the realm: to say nothing of a
certain dignity that belongs to the born
gentleman, your gold-headed cane, your
powdered head, and antique buckles
give you an air that must be quite
provoking
to our republican neighbours.
Ah indeed, I believe it, Mrs. Harrison,
but our neighbours, as you call them,
mean no compliment; this is a mere
mockery on their lips. Oh yes,
replied
Mrs. Harrison, I suppose so: that
is to say, it is a jocular title they have
given you, to console themselves for
your superiority.
Very likely, very likely, replied
the husband, and then added, I think
Mrs. Harrison, my dear, that you must
be convinced by this time, that the less
you have to do with these people, the
better. Mrs. Harrison made no reply;
she usually conformed to the spirit of
the promise contained in the Dutch
marriage
service, maintaining silence in the
presence of her husband; it was the
least difficult expression of acquiescence,
and long habit had given her a facility
in this extraordinary virtue.
The weeks passed on, autumn
succeeded
to summer, and Mrs. Harrison seemed
farther than ever from procuring an
intercourse with little Ellen. During
the warm weather, she had occasionally
seen her bounding over the field with
the elastic step of joyous childhood,
but now her careful guardian kept
her cautiously within doors.
It was a cold night, the last of
November
,
Mrs. Harrison's household was all
in bed except herself, and she,
insensible
to the blasts that howled about
her dwelling, was poring over an
interesting
book, when she was reminded
of the lateness of the hour by the candle
sinking into the socket. At this moment,
a bright light flashed through the
window
,
and shone on the opposite wall;
she hastened to the window to ascertain
the cause, and screamed, Oh heavens!
Allen's house is on fire. Her shriek
aroused her husband, who exclaimed
Lord bless me, is it possible! call the
servants my dear, and send them to
help the poor folks.
Mrs. Harrison, without awaiting this
direction, had hastened to awaken the
servants
;
and then rushed out of the house
herself, and proceeded with all possible
speed to the Allens, full of the horrible
VOL. I. L
apprehension that the family would be
consumed by the flames. The bright
light clearly defined every object; the
naked branches of the trees, every twig,
every withered leaf she saw plainly, but
heard no human voice, nor saw a moving
form. Avoiding the public road, which
was circuitous, she proceeded in a
straight line across the fields,
surmounted
the fences almost unconsciously,
and passed through the shallow stream
that divided the farms. She was within
a few yards of the house, the fowls
roused from their roost were crowing,
the pigeons startled from their nestling
place were fluttering over the flames:
still none of the family appeared. She
screamed with all the power of her
voice, while she hastened onward,
despairing of the lives of the unfortunate
family. The back part of the house,
which she had approached was enveloped
in flames; she passed around to the front,
and at that moment the door opened,
and Allen and his wife with her twin
infants in her arms, rushed asit appeared
from the midst of the fire. Mrs.
Harrison
caught her arm as she was passing
her, where, she exclaimed, is your
child?
My child! she replied, amazed
with terror, Oh God! Ellenshe is
there; and hugging her children closer
to her breast, she pointed to the flames.
Mrs. Harrison looked around for
assistance
,
there was no one near: Allen,
stupified with fright, had gone with a
single pail to a well at some distance
from the house; other members of the
family, who had escaped by different
windows, were so bewildered with terror
as to be incapable of rendering the
slightest
aid. Mrs. Harrison's resolution was
instantly taken; tell me where she
sleeps, she cried, it may be possible to
reach her through a window.
Oh! there is no window, she is in
the dark room next mine; and thisthis
is mine, she added, pointing to a front
apartment which the flames had not yet
L 2
reached. Mrs. Harrison darted
forward
and entered the house; the flames
were above her, before her, around her.
The passage was so darkened with
smoke that she could not perceive the
door she sought, but inspired with
preternatural
courage, menaced with death
on every side, already scorching with
the heat, and nearly suffocated with the
smoke, she pressed forward till she
reached a passage-way that crossed the
entrance at right angles. The flames
now burst through the wall at the
extremity
opposite the door she had
entered
,
and the air rushing in, rolled away
a volume of smoke, and discovered
Ellen standing at her door, with her
hand still on the latch, a dog was
crouching
at her feet, yelping, pulling her
night dress with his teeth, and urging
her forward with the most expressive
supplications; still the little creature
shrunk from the terrors before her,
unconscious
of the fatal risk of delay.
Mrs. Harrison snatched her in her arms,
rushed through the door, and in an
instant
was at Mrs. Allen's side. Both
instinctively sunk on their kneesno
sound escaped from them, but the
rapture
of gratitude was in their hearts, and
its incense rose to Him who had rescued
them from impending death.
The fire had been communicated from
a back building, which was joined to the
front (recently erected by Allen,) by a
narrow covered passage. Fortunately,
the wind, though blowing violently,
was in a direction to retard the progress
of the flames: to extinguish them was
impossible, for the house was of wood,
and the only fire engine in the town was
at too great a distance to render any
assistance. But had the family been
self-collected after they were awakened
by Mrs. Harrison's screams, they might
have saved all the house contained of
value. No one, however, seemed
capable
of a well-directed effort, till Roger,
Mrs. Harrison's English servant, arriving
on the field of action, called to Allen to
follow him, and forcing his way through
the window of Mrs. Allen's apartment,
he succeeded in clearing it of the
furniture
,
and placing it at a safe distance
from the destructive element. The
family
,
and the few persons who had come
to their aid, gathered around the relics;
little Ellen stood with one hand in Mrs.
Harrison's, one arm lovingly encircled
the neck of the faithful animal that first
broke her slumbers; the whole group
remained impotent and silent spectators,
till the house sunk a ruin under the still
crackling flames.
Mrs. Harrison first broke silence;
I am sure my good friends, said she,
you are thinking more of what is left
than what is taken.
Indeed you have guessed right,
ma'am, replied Allen, venting his
agitated
spirits in loud sobs. The Lord
that has spared my wife and little ones
and Ellen, is welcome to all the rest. If
I could but have saved my Bible that my
mother gave me, and my wife's silver
tankard, I would just care no more than
if it was a bonfire. The mention of
the excepted articles seemed to recall to
Mrs. Allen's mind something of
importance
.
She exclaimed, poor Ellen,
and looked anxiously around her, till
her eye falling on a trunk, she hastily
opened it and took from it a small box;
then turning to her husband, God be
praised, she said, every thing of
value
is saved. The first strong emotions
of gratitude having been directed to the
supreme Preserver, they now begun
with one voice to pour out their thanks
to Mrs. Harrison whose generous agency
they felt deeply. She begged them to
defer all such expressions, and urging
the necessity of a shelter for their little
ones, she insisted on their going home
with her. The good farmer and his
wife forgot their scruples in their
gratitude
and necessities; and in a short time
they were comfortably housed at the
Harrison mansion. After Mrs. Harrison
had made every provision for the
refreshment
and repose of her guests, and
after she had stowed away little Ellen
in a room adjoining her own, and
extended
her hospitalities even to the dog,
her faithful coadjutor in the
preservation
of the child, she retired to her own
room, nerved by gratitude and joy, to
the task of reconciling her husband to
the liberties she had taken with the
family
mansion. So strikingly did she
delineate the dangers and escape of the
family, the risk she herself had run, the
rescue of the child, and finally, the
exertions
of Roger, his truly
English
coolness
and intrepidity, that Mr. Harrison
himself anticipated the conclusion of the
story, by exclaiming, Lord bless me,
my dear! I hope you brought the
unfortunate
people home with you?
Certainly
,
my dear, she replied. You
did rightperfectly right. There is no
other establishment in Lansdown equal
to giving them all a shelter. But
Martha
,
my dear, he continued, you ran
a great riskquite an unwarrantable
risk, considering the relative importance
of your life to that of the child's.
Oh! thank you, for thinking my
life so important. I only acted like a
dutiful wife, and emulated your
example
.
You have forgotten at what hazard
you saved Charles Lindsay's life.
Forgotten! no, my dear; but then
you know a man has always more
self-possession
than a woman, more mind for
emergencies, and besides, Charles was
the heir of an honourable familysome
compensation for the risk. However,
all is well that ends well. You have
shown a spirit worthy of a noble name,
Martha my dear; and I shall take
particular
pleasure in writing an account of
the whole affair to Sir Harry by the next
ship that sails for London.
Mrs. Harrison, having thus succeeded
beyond her utmost hopes in making a
favourable impression on the mind of
her husband, retired to rest; her bosom
filled with those sweet emotions that are
the peculiar property and rich reward
L 2
of the virtuous. If Mrs. Harrison felt
any anxiety the succeeding day about
the intercourse of the host and his guests,
it was removed when she saw that the
sense of protection and condescending
kindness on the one part, and of
gratitude
on the other, produced a happy
state of feeling between the respective
parties.
CHAPTER VIII.
Oh, 'tis the curse of love and still approved,
When woman cannot love, when they're beloved.
Two Gentlemen of Verond
.
In
the week following the
destruction
of his own house, Mr. Allen
succeeded
in obtaining another for the
accommodation of his family till the
following
summer. The rigours of the
stern season then approaching,
rendering
it necessary to defer the re-building
of his own, Mrs. Harrison proposed to
Mrs. Allen to leave Ellen Bruce at the
mansion-house till she should again be
re-established in her own home. There
was such obvious advantages in this
arrangement for the child, Mrs. Harrison
pressed her request so earnestaly, and
Mrs. Allen felt that it would be so
ungrateful
to refuse, that she yielded her
own inclination, and left Ellen with her
devoted friend. The presence of this
sweet child operated on Mrs. Harrison's
affections as the first breaking out of
the sun after a long series of cloudy
weather upon the physical constitution.
She had been resigned in afflictions,
patient under all those often recurring
vexations and petty disappointments
that are by general consent pronounced
more trying to human virtue than
great calamities; she had endured for
twenty years the exacting
consequential
peevish selfishness of a husband, in
all respects dissimilar to herself, in most
inferior; and she had become neither
nervous
, petulant, nor selfish. Indeed
so successful were her dutiful efforts,
that all her acquaintance deemed her
quite blind to her husband's faults;
and that she was not, never appeared
except when, to attain some good
purpose
,
her cautious and adroit approaches
to his mind betrayed that she knew
where his prejudices were stationed, and
where his passions ruled. If the hasty
affection of her youth had been alienated
by her husband's faults, their place
had been supplied by the resolution of
virtue, and by the tolerance of a tender
nature that felt more pity than aversion
for human frailty; and finally perhaps
she loved him; for neither her words
nor actions ever expressed that she
did not: if the maidenly reserve that
never tells a love, is the poet's
eloquent
theme, the matronly virtue that
conceals the want of it, is certainly far
more deserving of the moralist's praise.
Little Ellen opened the fountain of
Mrs. Harrison's affections; and such
was the renovating influence produced
on her, that her husband, who never
dreamed whence it proceeded, remarked
how prodigiously the country winter
improved her health and spirits; and
congratulated himself upon his wise
decision
to remove from the chilling airs of
the coast to the family estate, always
noted for its salubrious situation.
Every moment of leisure Mrs.
Harrison
devoted to her little favourite.
She taught her every thing she was
capable of receiving at the age of five
years, in the way of formal instruction.
She was the ingenious mistress, and the
partaker of her innocent revels. She
insinuated
moral, and it may be added,
religious
principles into her mind, in the
winning
form of stories. She warred against
the natural selfishness of childhood in
all its specious forms, and she completely
subdued an impetuosity of temper, that
had been suffered if not nurtured by
Mrs. Allen's indulgence: in short she
seemed constantly to realize that she
had the training of an immortal creature;
and to feel that so sweet a form as Ellen's
should, envelope and contain naught
but celestial spirits.
Allen began with the return of
summer
the rebuilding of his house; and
assisted by the voluntary contributions
of his townsmen, he soon completed it.
The prompt benevolence of our
country
people on such occasions has been
justly celebrated by a foreigner, an
observer, (perhaps a partial one) of our
manners.
Ici tous sont egaux: l'abondance est commune,
On ignore les noms de crime et d'infortune,
Si le feu, si l'orage a fait un indigent,
La bienfaisance accourt; c'est l'effet d'un moment.
The time at length arrived for Mrs.
Allen to reclaim Ellen. Mrs. Harrison
urged delay after delay, and was so
earnestly seconded by her husband, (who
had been beguiled of his uncomfortable
stateliness by the playful little creature)
that Mrs. Allen finally consented to
surrender her own inclinations, and to
make a permanent arrangement with
Mrs. Harrison, which should allow Ellen
to pass half her time at the
mansion-house
.
In this arrangement there was a
system of checks and balances that
produced
that singular and felicitous union
of diversity of qualities which constituted
the rare perfection of Ellen's character.
Mrs. Harrison communicated her taste
and skill in drawing, her knowledge of
French and Italian, and all those arts of
female handicraft that were the fashion of
her day. Her pupil was taught curiously
to explore the records of history, and to
delight in the bright creations of poetry.
When she might have been in danger
of an exclusive taste for the occupations
of those who have the privilege of
independence
and of leisure, she returned to
Mrs. Allen, to take her lessons in
practical
life, to share and lighten the domestic
cares of her good friend, and to acquire
those household arts that it might be
the duty of her station to perform, and
which it is the duty of every station to
understand. Ellen might have caught
the pensiveness of Mrs. Harrison's
manner, with its grace and polish: she
might have forgotten the active duties
of life in listening with her to the
melody
of naturethe music of the passing
stream, the rustling of the leaves, or the
song of the birds, or in watching the
changeful forms of the summer clouds,
as their shadows dropped on the
mountain's
side, or danced in frolic humours
over the grassy fields and thick standing
corn. But for all this, the danger of
secluded life to those who possess
sensibility
and taste, there was an antidote
in the occupations of Mrs. Allen's
household
the
spell of imagination was
dispelled
by the actual services of life.
Had Ellen been less grateful or
affectionate
in her nature, she might have
loved one of her guardians to the
exclusion
of the other; but she felt their
gratuitous kindness with the sensibility
of a truly generous mind; she saw in
them the parents that Providence had
provided for her orphanage, and without
any of the pride or restlessness of
dependence
,
her devotion to them both
evinced
her eager desire that they should
realize all the beatitude of
benevolence
.
Had her friends been less excellent
than they were, some mischief might
have resulted to our heroine from the
diversity of their religious opinions. Both
were Christians in faith and experience,
but Mrs. Harrison was educated in the
episcopal church, and was exact in all
its observances: and Mrs. Allen, a real
descendant of the pilgrims, was as
rigid in her faith as was compatible
with the mildness of her character.
The `natural enmity' that bigots might
have found, or made, between their
respective faiths, was destroyed by the
spirit of Christianity, as it must be,
where that spirit bears rule, and the
only strife between these noble-minded
women seemed to be, which should most
sedulously cultivate the virtues of their
young friend. Mr. Harrison certainly
not remarkable for his Christian graces,
was scrupulous in maintaining all the
appointments
of the established church.
He never countenanced by his august
presence the worship of the village
meeting. It was one of his favourite
observations, and he uttered it with the
pomp of an oracle, that puritanism was
the mother of rebellion. He was always
gratified with Ellen's respectful
attendance
on his reading of the church
service
;
and he noticed more than once
how remarkably well her voice sounded
in the responses. He blamed his wife
for not making an effort to prevent
Ellen's going to the village meeting
with the Allens during her residence
with them, which he said she might
easily do, as the girl certainly had sense
enough to discern the difference
between
worship and talking. Allen too,
dissatisfied with what he deemed his
wife's lukewarmness, reproved her for
not interposing her authority to prevent
Ellen from `wasting the Sabbath in
hearing
a form of words read over by a man
that had no more religion than the pope,
and who all the while flattered himself
that none but an episcopal tory could go
to heaven.' Happily for the peace of our
heroine, neither of the ladies deemed it
her duty to interfere with the wishes of
the other, and she grew up, nurtured in
the spirit of our blessed religion, without
bigotry toany of the forms with
whichaccident
,
pride, or prejudice has invested it.
Time rolled on, and every year found
Ellen improved in loveliness: the gay
and reckless spirit of childhood gave
place to the vivacity and sensitiveness
of fifteen. Mrs. Allen deemed it
inexpedient
to delay longer to
communicate
to her such particulars of her
mother's history as she was at liberty to
impart. It was impossible any longer
to evade her natural and just curiosity
on the subject, and as she could not for
ever be kept in ignorance, Mrs. Allen
thought it necessary that she should
begin to fortify her mind for the evils
that might await her. Ellen received
the communication with a gentle
submission
to the trials of her lot that
astonished
both her friends,for Mrs.
Harrison
had long been in Mrs. Allen's
confidence
she
saw that dark clouds
enveloped
her; stillfor hope is the element
of youthexcept in some moments of
fearful apprehension, she believed that
she should yet enjoy a clear heaven and
a bright day.
The progress of time had wrought
some changes in the Allen family.
Edward, the only son, had been sent to
Vermont, to reside in the family of Mr.
Lenox his uncle, and George Lenox his
cousin, a student in Harvard university,
passed his vacations at Lansdown. The
mother of Justyn Allen had become a
widow, and had been induced by her
children to fix her residence with them;
and Mr. Allen had been persuaded by
one of his neighbours to relinquish the
toils of his farm for the easy acquisitions
of trade, and to embark all the capital
his credit could command in a
mercantile
enterprise.
Mr. Harrison's infirmities had grown
with his years. He passed his time in
deprecating the encroaching spirit of
Jacobinism, and in predicting the certain
dissolution of the federal government.
His prejudices operated like a
distemper
,
and gave to every object a
distorted
form and threatening aspect. He
saw nothing in our thriving institutions
in the diffusion of intelligence, virtue
and prosperity through the mass of
society
,
but menaces of degradation and
elements of disorder. It is reported of
our chief magistrate, that during his late
visit to our northern metropolis, he
exclaimed
on beholding the concourse of
well-dressed, well-behaved people
assembled
to greet him, Where are
your common people? This
exclamation
,
so flattering to a just republican
pride, would have conveyed to the loyal
ears of Robert Harrison a sense of
hopeless
degradation; for in his view every
elevation of the commonalty depressed
the level of the gentleman. Fortunately
for him, the respect inspired by the
good sense and benevolence of his wife
shielded him from the insults which his
folly provoked; and his connexion with
Ellen Bruce was a link between him
and his neighbours which protected him
from their open scorn.
Ellen, as her mind matured, became
every day more dear and necessary to
Mrs. Harrison, with whom, from fifteen
to eighteen, her time was passed almost
exclusively. Even Mr. Harrison
condescended
to say that he could not live
without her, and his wife, availing
herself
of this favourable expression,
ventured
to suggest to him to make some
provision for her favourite in case of the
misfortune of his death. `He had
nothing
,'
he said, `to dispose of, but the
family estate, and that he thought could,
with no propriety be diverted from
flowing
in its natural channel to the heir at
law,' a distant relation, residing in
England
.
Mrs. Harrison suggested that, as
this gentleman had a noble revenue
from his own estates, such an accession
as their little property would be but as
a drop to the ocean; and she urged that
it would be in the spirit of the known
generosity of his family to confer his
bounty on an orphan; she intimated
that Ellen was quite dependent on him,
for except a few hundred dollars
inherited
from her parents, she had
nothing
,
and could have no rational
reliance
on the Allens; for it had been for
some time whispered in Lansdown that
Allen, in his mercantile enterprise, had
met with the fate of all those who,
since the time of sop's fish, have
aspired to some other element than that
for which Providence had destined them.
All these arguments she stated so cogently
that her husband was persuaded to
comply
with her wishes, and he promised
that during a visit to Boston, whither he
was going the next week to celebrate the
king's birth-day, he would have his will
duly drawn and executed, and devise
the family estate to Ellen Bruce.
This good resolution shared the fate of
so many others left at the mercy of the
casualties of life. Mr. Harrison went
to Boston, and on the birth-day dined
at the British consul's with a select band
of loyalists. The illustrious occasion
and the good cheer of his host tempted
him to the excessive demonstrations of
enthusiasm common on such occasions,
and the consequence was that he died
the succeeding night of on apoplexy.
A few months subsequent to Mr.
Harrison's death, Justyn Allen also
paid the debt of nature, and in
consequence
of the unfortunate issue of his
mercantile enterprise, left his wife, his
old mother, and his children, without
any provision. The loss of her husband
and the ruin of their affairs, aggravated
a mortal disease under which Mrs. Allen
had been for some time suffering; and
as if the family was destined to illustrate
the common remark that troubles never
come singly, Emily became so sickly
that a physician pronounced change of
air to be necessary to her. At this
time Susan Allen (whom our readers
may remember as the sister of Justyn
Allen, who remained finally attached
to the shaker society) arrived at
Lansdown on her way to visit a society
of her own people at Harvard. Mrs.
Allen, anxious to remove Emily from
VOL. I. M
the distressing scenes that she was
conscious
awaited her at home, thankfully
accepted a proposition which her aunt
made, to take her upon this excursion for
the benefit of the ride and change of
place. Unforeseen circumstances
detained
her for a long time within the
sphere of her aunt's influence; and her
mind weakened, and her spirits dejected,
she adopted, as has been seen, the strange
faith of her enthusiastic relative. In the
mean time Ellen, devoted to the care
of Mrs. Allen, allowed herself no
relaxation
but that of passing a few hours
occasionally
with Mrs. Harrison.
It was during one of these visits that
Mrs. Harrison inquired if Allen's affairs
were so fatally involved as to render it
necessary to surrender the house to his
creditors. Ellen believed not. George
Lenox, she said, had advanced two
hundred dollars to redeem a portion of
the property.
George Lenox! exclaimed Mrs.
Harrison how, dear Ellen, has he the
ability to do so generous an act?
He draws on talent and industry,
replied Ellen, and I do not believe
his drafts will ever be dishonoured.
I know, my love, rejoined Mrs.
Harrison, that youth forms vast
expectations from those resources, but
I likewise know that they are not
always
answered by ready money.
Ellen explained to Mrs.
Harrison
that young Lenox, after
defraying
his expences at the university,
had that amount of money
remaining
the
fruit of his industry and
economy.
Such a gift, said Mrs. Harrison,
his all, was indeed most generous, and
deserves the bright reward that is
glowing
on your cheek at this moment; but
still I do not quite comprehend how your
young wits have contrived to satisfy the
demand on the portion of the property
redeemed
with two hundred dollars. The
glow that had suffused Ellen's cheek
deepened as she replied dearest Mrs.
Harrison, forgive me if I have not dealt
frankly with you; I wished to avoid
exciting
M 2
your tender, but, believe me,
unnecessary
solicitude about me. I have
made the best use of my little inheritance
in appropriating it to the relief of my
friends: the sum, as you know, was
originally four hundred dollars. It has
been more than doubled by Mr. Allen,
more prudent in the management of my
affairs than his own; and yesterday I
had the happiness of giving it into
George Lenox's hands, and of seeing
the joy of Mrs. Allen, when it was
announced
to her by her principal creditor
that a valuable portion of her property
had been redeemed by an unknown
friend; and had you seen the expression
that lit up her sick face, when she
exclaimed
,
`thank God! my old mother
will not have to go forth from her son's
house to seek a shelter in her old age,
and my children, my dear children,
may come home to live again under
their father's roof.' Oh, Mrs.
Harrison
,
you might have envied me the
pleasure
of that moment, had it cost me ten
thousand times the paltry sum I
sacrificed
for it.
Then she is ignorant of her
benefactor
?
Yesbut do not give me that
namebenefactor! dear Mrs. Harrison,
it can only be because I owe to you an
equal debt, that you forget my
obligations
to Mrs. Allen: did not she save
my helpless infancy from neglect, and
without a mother's instincts or rights,
has she not nurtured me with a mother's
tenderness?
You are rightyou are right, my
noble-minded Ellen, replied Mrs.
Harrison
,
as Ellen paused in her appeal:
my fear of the possible evils you may
encounter (should I be removed from
you) from want and dependence afflicts
me with undue anxiety. I hope I should
have courage enough not to shrink
from any evils that menaced myself,
but when I think of your being exposed
to a cold selfish world, I feel a mother's
timidity; you, with your strange
mysterious
history, Ellen, your
inexperience
,
your generous confiding temper,
with all that refinement that I have
foolishly, perhaps sinfully, delighted to
watch stealing over your character, with
all the graces that fit you for
Oh, stop dear Mrs. Harrison, this is
strange language for you to hold, and
me to hear; my highest ambition is to
do well my duty in whatever station
Providence assigns me. This is an
ambition
,
as you have taught me, that
cannot
be disappointed; here the race is to
the swift, and the battle to the strong.
I will not, she added, playfully, any
longer expose my humility to
temptation
;
and she put on her hat, and
stooped
to her friend for a farewell kiss, when
Mrs. Harrison said, not yet, Ellen,
you must not go till you have explained
to me this benevolent sympathy of
yours and young Lenox's; this generous
union of your fortunes is doubtless
received
by him as a good omen?
The event of our friend's happiness
has already interpreted the omen, and
explained all its significance, replied
Ellen, rising and walking away from
Mrs. Harrison.
Now come back to me, Ellen, said
she, and seat yourself here on my
footstool
,
and if your tongue will not speak
the truth, I must read it in your
truth-telling
eyes and cheeks.
Ellen turned towards her friend for
the first time in her life reluctantly;
and re-seating herself, she said with an
embarrassed air, I scarcely can
conjecture
what you expect from me.
I will not tax your sagacity to
conjecture
,
but come directly to the point
do you love George Lenox?
Most certainly I do; I should be
the most ungrateful
Pshaw, my dear Ellen, it is not
the love that springs from any such
dutiful source as gratitude which is in
question at this moment; but that
mysterious
sentiment, inexplicable,
uncontrolable
which does not require, and
seldom, I fear, admits a reason for its
existence.
I should be sorry, indeed, to confess
or to feel such a sentiment for any one.
Evading, again! Ah, dear Ellen,
the nature of the animal is known by its
doublings. You are so deep in the
science as to demand the use of technics:
tell me then, are you
in love
with George
Lenox?
Indeed I am notyou know I am
not, Mrs. Harrison.
I fancied I knew that you were not,
but nothing less than a gift of second
sight is infallible on such occasions; we
must go a little farther, Ellen, even at
the risk of deepening the crimson on
your cheeksyou surely are not
unconscious
that Lenox is
in love
with you?
He has never told me so, replied
Ellen.
That may beyoung Edwin `never
talked
of love'but without much
experience
,
you know there are expressions
that speak this passion more emphatically
than language: and, exempt as you are
from vanity, I think you cannot have
misunderstood this amiable young man's
devotion to youhis eagerness for your
society, his anxiety to gratify all your
wishes, his eye fixed on you as if he were
spell-bound
O say no more, exclaimed Ellen,
hiding her face on her friend's lap, I
have understood George, but I hoped
To be able to make an
appropriate
return. Have I made out your
meaning?
Far from itI hoped that our
approaching separationthat new
pursuits
,
new objects, would efface the
accidental
preference which has arisen from
our early and confidential intercourse.
In short, you trusted to those
accidents
over which you have no control,
to heal the wound that your kindness,
your unreserved manner, to this poor
young man has been for years deepening.
Oh, dear Mrs. Harrison, of what
do you suspect meof the baseness of
coquetry?
No, Ellen, no, you are incapable of
M 3
trifling with the happiness of any one;
your error has arisen from inexperience.
I should have cautioned you but I am
not fit to be your guide and counsellor
in affairs of this nature, for though I
have lived more than half a century, my
secluded, childless life has offered few
opportunities of observation, and fewer
still where my sagacity has been
stimulated
by interest. I forgive your surprise
and your indignation, my love, at what
you imagined my suspicion of coquetry,
for I know nothing more selfish,
heartless
,
base, and degrading, than for a
woman to encourage, nay permit the
growth of an affection which she has no
intention of returning.
I should detest such a miserable
triumph of vanity. exclaimed Ellen;
I should hate myself were I capable
of it, and George, kind, generous as he
is, the sufferer. What ought I to do
can I do any thing now, she asked,
with the impatience of a generous mind,
to repair the evil it has inflicted?
No, my love, replied Mrs.
Harrison
,
it is only by leaving undone, that
mischief can be avoided in affairs of this
kind. George goes to-morrow, avoid
seeing him again, if you can without
apparent design, for farewell words and
looks furnish food for the sweet and
bitter fancies of a brain-sick lover
during
any interval of absence.
The severe suffering, she continued,
as she marked the deep melancholy that
had succeeded Ellen's usually animated
expression, you feel at this moment,
from having been the involuntary cause
of disappointment to your friend, will
teach you in future jealously to guard
the happiness that may be exposed to
the influence of your attraction. You
are in no danger of the silly vanity of
fancying that civility means love, and of
giving importance to every trifling
gallantry
;
but modesthumble in your self
estimate, you are in danger of wounding
deeply the bosom that is bared to your
involuntary shafts.
There is no need of caution for the
future, replied Ellen, no one else
will ever care for me so much as George
does.
That may be, dear Ellen, but as you
are scarce eighteen, it is possible that
you have not finished your experience
in love affairs; if you preserve that
woe-begone visage indeed, any other
safeguard against the effect of your
charms will be quite superfluous: come,
my love, cheer up, and let me hear your
sweet voice at my dinner table, as sweet
to me as minstrelsy to an old chieftain.
Ellen made a vain effort to recover
her spirits, and then hurried away that
she might indulge her ingenuous sorrow
without giving pain to her friend. She
was careful to follow Mrs. Harrison's
prudent counsel, and when George
Lenox
came to pass his last evening with
her, he received a friendly farewell
message, with the information, that her
duty to Mrs. Allen precluded her seeing
him again. Before the morning dawned
George was in a stage-coach on his way
to the south. He passed the boundary
of Lansdown with almost as heavy a
heart as our first parent bore through
the gates of Paradise: feeling like all
true lovers, that the world is divided
into two parts; that where
she
is, and
that where
she
is not.
It would be difficult to say whether
Mrs. Harrison was most gratified or
disappointed
by the result of her
investigation
into the state of Ellen's affections.
While she lived her annuity was ample
for the support of Ellen and herself;
but nothing could be more precarious
than such a dependence, and Ellen might
be left to encounter alone the wants of
life. Young Lenox had promising
talents, and those getting along
faculties
,
that are a warrant for success: his
devoted attachment was merit in the
eyes of Mrs. Harrison; still he wanted
those refined habits, that delicacy of
taste, the result of cultivation, and those
graces of manner to all which Mrs.
Harrison from her early habits and
associations
,
gave (it may be) an undue
importance
.
There is such a taste for
learning (we use the word in its
provincial
sense) pervading all ranks in New
England,if indeed ranks can be
predicated
of a society where none dare to
define the dividing lines, and few can
perceive themthat we often see those
advanced to the most conspicuous
stations
in society, whose boyish years have
been spent in ploughing the narrow
fields of the patrimonial farm. There
are some disagreeable results from this
state of things, on the whole so
honourable
;
and Mrs. Harrison felt that in
implanting in Ellen the tastes that
belonged
to the highest grades of society,
and in cultivating the habits of the
born lady, she had conferred a
superiority
of doubtful value; and she was
almost led to regret the fastidiousness
which had been her own work, when
she felt herself compelled to trace to it
Ellen's rejection of the affection of one
who was her equal in all important
respects
,
and whose excellent character
and flattering prospects would have
rendered
a connexion with him highly
advantageous
.
We said Mrs. Harrison
almost
regretted the state of Ellen's
heartwe fear she did not
quite
, for in
common with the best individuals, she
sometimes sacrificed general and
immutable
principles to the indulgence of her
favourite peculiarities.
Mrs. Allen's life closed at the end of
a few painful weeks, and Ellen, after
having performed every service for her
with the strictest fidelity, wept over her
with filial sorrow. Old Mrs. Allen soon
after joined her grandson at Eton, and
Ellen thus unfettered by duty, returned
to Mrs. Harrison's, where her life
passed
happily in pursuits congenial to her
taste, till she was summoned to Vermont
by intelligence of the threatening illness
of Edward Allen.
CHAPTER IX.
See what a ready tongue suspicion hath.
Henry IVth
.
Our
readers no doubt will think it is
quite time that we should return from
our long digression to the family at
Eton. There nothing occurred worthy
their notice till one evening Mrs. Lenox
entering Miss Bruce's apartment, said,
Ellen are you here, and quite alone?
Quite alone, replied Ellen, Miss
Redwood has not left her father's room
since they took their tea.
I am glad of itglad the girl has
the grace to stay with him even for half
an hour, though her society seems to be
of little use or consolation; and
particularly
glad, dear Ellen, to find you
alone. I must interrupt your starlight
meditations, or rather give you an
interesting
subject for them: but we shall
want a light, for I have brought you a
letter to read.
A letter!
Yes, my dear, a letter, and to me
the most delightful I ever received.
She was about to proceed to divulge its
contents, when both she and Ellen were
startled by a sound about Miss
Redwood's
bed. Mrs. Lenox advanced to
the bed and laid her hand on it. There
is no one here, she said, I fancied
I heard a sound. I fancied so too,
said Ellen.
Happily we were both mistaken,
my dear, for I should be very sorry to
tell my story to any ears but yours.
Ellen, I am the proudest and happiest of
mothers; I have just received a letter
from George, which proves that he is
worthy of his prosperity.
I am very glad of it.
And do you not yet, Ellen, suspect
the reason
you
have to be gladdo you
not know that George loves you?
Oh, I hope not! exclaimed Ellen
involuntarily.
Hope not, my dear Ellen! I am
sure there is not another in the world so
worthy of his lovenot another, who
would be such an ornament to the
station
in which George will place his
wifenot another that I should be so
happy to call my child. She paused
for a moment for a reply, but Ellen
said nothing.
Do not, Mrs. Lenox continued,
repress your feelings. George, like a
dutiful son, has made me his confidante,
and why should not you? George
himself
can hardly love you better than
I do.
Thank youthank you, Mrs.
Lenox.
No, my dear, you must not thank
me, you are worthy your good fortune,
and your own merit has secured it.
I have used no influence, though I
would have done any thing to have
brought about the connection; but this
is George's unbiassed decision, he
confesses
to me he has loved you ever since
he was a boy. Is not such a good and
constant heart worth having, Ellen, not
to mention being the wife of a celebrated
young clergyman?
Here the happy mother again paused,
and again wondered she received no
reply.
Not a word, Ellen? well, you shall
have your own way; it is in vain to
expect common sense, or a common
way of showing it, from girls in love:
so I will just bring you a candle, and
leave you to read the letter by yourself:
only remember that the southern mail
goes, out to-morrow, and that lovers like
to have their declarations come back to
them as quick as echoes.
Thus saying, Mrs. Lenox rose to leave
the room, when Ellen caught her by the
arm, and exclaimed, stop one moment
Mrs. Lenox, and hear me.
Hear you, dear Ellen; George
himself could scarcely be more delighted
to hear you. Ellen's tongue seemed to
be again paralysing, but making a strong
effort, she said, you know, Mrs. Lenox,
what reasons I have for wishing to defer
for the present all thoughts of marriage;
you know that I ought not to involve
any one in my unhappy destiny; you
knowGeorge does notthat possibly
disgrace awaits me.
But, my dearest Ellen, what is all
this to the purpose? Have you so poor
an opinion of my son's attachment to
you, as to fancy that the worst issue of
your uncertainties which you can
apprehend
would be a straw in his way? No!
he loves you, for yourself alonetruly
devotedly loves you.
Ellen was quite overcome with the
generous, affectionate zeal of the mother,
and bursting into tears, she clasped Mrs.
Lenox's hand in hers, and said, I do
not deserve this, my dear, kind friend;
I have not been frank with you. I
do not, she added, faltering, I do not
love George.
Not love him! exclaimed Mrs.
Lenox, drawing back from Ellen, not
love him, Ellen! it can't be, childit is
impossible. Poor Ellen at this moment
wished it were impossible; she sunk
back in her chair, and dark as the room
was, instinctively covered her face with
her handkerchief, while her friend, in
great agitation, walked up and down
the room, talking half to herself and half
to Ellen. Not love him! I cannot
believe it; you have always known him.
You know there is not a blemish on
his character. A pious ministera man
of education and talentsvery good
talentsquite uncommon talentsand
a better tempered boy never lived; and
as to his appearance, there may be
handsomer men than George, but there
never was a pleasanter looka good
faithful son he has beenand brother,
and that is a sure sign he will be a good
husband: and he loves you, Ellen; she
concluded, pausing, and placing her
hand on Ellen's shoulder, and you
can't be in your right mind if you do
not love him.
Ellen felt that it would be in vain to
attempt to convince the fond mother
that that could be a right mind which
did not, as she would think, justly
appreciate
George's merits: and she was
too delicate, too gentle to attempt to
vindicate herself. She was grateful for
the mother's and the son's generous
preference
of an isolated being; and
approaching
alone the crisis of her fate,
she was reluctant to refuse the kind
protecting
arm that was stretched out to
succour and protect her.
She faltered for a moment in the
resolution
she had instinctively taken: she
could not bear to afflict, perhaps to
alienate her partial friendsshe might
be able to command her affections. But
alas! the spirit would not come when
she did call it; for when Mrs. Lenox,
suspecting some infirmity of purpose
from Ellen's continued silence, said, in
a softened tone, It was but a girlish
silly feeling after allwas it, dear Ellen?
you will not be such a child as to throw
away the prize you have drawn. She
replied with a dignified decision that
blasted Mrs. Lenox's reviving hopes. I
have nothing to give for that prize, and
it cannot be mine. George must seek
some one who can return his affections,
and thus deserve themI cannot.
Well, this is most extraordinary,
replied Mrs. Lenox, why what do you
wish for? what do you expect, Ellen?
Nothing, nothing in the world,
Mrs. Lenox, but your, and your son's
forgiveness, for what must seem to
you ingratitude, insensibility; for
myself
,
she added, my path is a solitary
one; but there is light on it from
heaven
;
and if I can preserve the kindness
of my friends, I shall have courage and
patience for the rest. There was so
much purity and truth and feeling in
Ellen's words, that Mrs. Lenox could
not retain the resentment that in spite
of her better feelings had risen in her
bosom. Our forgiveness! she
replied
,
kindly, Oh Ellen, you need not
ask our forgiveness. George, poor
fellow
,
thinks you can do no wrong, and
I always did think so: and even now
I do not feel so much for my son as to
see you so blind to your own happiness.
How long this conference, so
unsatisfactory
to the mother and
embarrassing
to Ellen, might have continued, it is
impossible to say, had it not been
interrupted
by the entrance of Miss Redwood.
Ah! she exclaimed, a tte a tte,
confidential, no doubt; I am sorry to
interrupt it, she continued, looking at
both the ladies, and observing the signs
of emotion that were too evident to
escape notice; it seems to have been
interesting. Come Lilly, you lazy
wretch, she added, turning to the
servant
,
who was lying stretched out on
the floor at the foot of the bed, get
up, and undress me; I have been dying
with sleep this half hour, while papa
was prosing away at me.
Lilly's appearance on the floor at the
entrance
of the light explained to the ladies
the noise they had heard; they exchanged
looks of mutual intelligence, but both
concluding she had been asleep, they
gave themselves no farther concern about
her. Mrs. Lenox bade the young ladies
good night, and repaired to her husband
with a heavy heart to acquaint him
with the result of George's suit. He,
good easy man, after expressing some
surprise, concluded with the truisms,
that girls were apt to be notional; that
to be sure Ellen was a likely young
woman, but there were plenty of fish in
the sea, and good ones too, that would
spring at a poorer bait than George
could throw out; and besides, he added,
by way of consolation, there was
something
of a mist about Ellen, and though
he should not have made that an objection
seeing that she was a good girl, and
George had an idea about her, yet, as
VOL. I. N
matters had turned out as they had, he
believed it was all for the best. Mrs.
Lenox thought her husband had very
inadequate notions of Ellen Bruce's
merits, but she was wise enough to
refrain from disturbing his philosophy
on this trying occasion.
Soon after Mrs. Lenox left the young
ladies' apartment, Miss Bruce took her
hat and shawl and stole softly down
stairs. Miss Redwood listened to her
footsteps till she heard the house door
close after her. In the name of Heaven,
Lilly, she demanded of her servant,
what can she have gone out for at this
time in the evening?
I am not the witch that can tell
that, Miss Caroline; but one thing I
can tell, I heard her say to Doctor
Bristol
as I passed them, standing together in
the entry just before he went away
to-day
,
`I shall not fail to be there.'
Nothing could be more indefinite than
Lilly's information; however, it was
more satisfactory than none, and after
pondering on it for a moment, her
mistress
said, your ears are worth having,
girltell me, did you hear what Miss
Bruce and Mrs. Lenox were talking
about in the dark here? That did I,
Miss Caroline, trust me for using my
ears. I waked when Mrs. Lenox came
into the room, and was just starting
up, when, thinks I to myself, they'll be
saying something about Miss Cary, and
I'll just lie snug and hear itit will be
nuts for her.
Did they talk about me? what said
they? tell me quick.
Why, Miss Cary, they said just
nothing at all about you: no more than
if you was'ent nobody.
What in the name of wonder then
did they talk aboutwhat could they
have to say? asked Miss Redwood,
wondering internally that there should
be any field of vision in which she was
not the most conspicuous object.
N 2
Oh, Miss Cary, replied Lilly, their
talk was all about themselves; that is to say
about Miss Bruce and Mr. George Lenox,
that I told you was going to marry her;
but it appears she is all off the notion of
it now, though his mother begged her
as hard as a body might beg for your
striped gown that you don't wear any
more, Miss Cary.
My striped gownyou may have it
Lilly, but tell me what Mrs. Lenox said,
and what Miss Bruce, and all about it.
Lilly proceeded to the details, and by
her skilful use of the powers of memory
and invention, she made out a much
longer conversation then we have
reported
to our readers; from which
conversation
Caroline deduced the natural
inference
that Miss Bruce would not sacrifice
the opportunity of an advantageous
connexion
without a good and sufficient
reason
.
What could be that reason? The
attempt
to solve this mystery led her into a
labyrinth of conjectures, from which
there was no clue for extrication but the
apparent and mutual interest that
subsisted
between her father and Miss Bruce.
It was possible that Ellen indulged hopes
of a more splendid alliance than that
with George Lenox. Caroline really
had too much sense to allow much force
to this extraordinary conclusion; still she
continued alternately to dwell on that,
and on the reason of Miss Bruce's
absence
,
till Lilly spoke of the expected
arrival of the Westalls. This opened
a new channel for her thoughtsthe
debt of a new beau, a possible admirer,
could rival any other interest, and before
she sunk to sleep, Ellen's affairs subsided
to the insignificance which they really
bore in relation to Miss Redwood.
Caroline found other influences as
unfriendly
to sleep as the bracing air of
the lake.' She awoke with the first
beam of day, and instinctively raised her
head from her pillow to ascertain whether
Ellen Bruce's bed was unoccupied; it
was, but her ear caught the sound of a
footstep
in the entry, and immediately after
Ellen entered with as little noise as
possible
.
You need not be so quiet, Miss
Bruce, said Caroline, I am wide awake.
I am happy if I do not disturb
you, replied Ellen, still I must be
quiet on account of the family. `Ah,'
thought Caroline, `the family then know
nothing of this manuvre.' You look
excessively pale and wearied, Miss
Bruce.
I am wearied, replied Ellen,
without
gratifying or even noticing Miss
Redwood's curiosity: but, she added,
as she threw herself on the bed, I shall
have time before breakfast to refresh
myself.
Caroline with the transmuting power of
jealousy, had converted Ellen's simplest
actions into aliments for her suspicions,
and now that a circumstance had occurred
which did not readily admit of an
explanation
,
she exulted in the expectation
of a triumph over her father, who had
treated her curiosity in relation to Ellen
as quite childless and groundless. Your
favourite, papa, she said, seizing a
favourable opportunity when she was
sitting alone with her father after
dinner
,
has a singular taste for
walking
.
It may appear singular to you,
Caroline
,
with your southern habits; but
I imagine you will not find it
uncommon
at the north.
O, north or south, papa, I fancy it
is not common for lady pedestrians to
pass the whole night in promenades.
The whole nightwhat do you
mean, my child? Caroline explained.
Her father listened to her detail with
undisguised interest, and after a few
moments' pause, he said, it would have
been natural and quite proper, as you
are Miss Bruce's room-mate, that you
should have asked of her the reason of
her absence last nightdid you so?
Oh, thank you, papa, no; I have
not yet taken lessons enough of these
question-asking Yankees, to inquire into
that which this lady of mysteries
evidently
chooses to keep secret, even from
her dear friends the Lenoxes.
Well, my dear, since you will not
or cannot gratify your curiosity, I
advise
you to suspend it, and to do
yourself
and Miss Bruce the justice to
remember
the remark of a sagacious
observer
,
that the `simplest characters
sometimes baffle all the art of
decipherers
.'
You look displeased,
Caroline
let
us talk on some subject on
which we shall agree better. I think
we may look for the Westalls to-day.
Thank Heaven!any change will
be agreeable.
Agreeable as a change, no doubt
but the society of the Westalls will, I
hope, have some more enduring charm
than novelty; the mother I am certain
will be quite to your tasteand to the
son, if report speaks truly, no young
lady can be indifferent.
How papa, is he handsome, clever,
rich, accomplished?
HandsomeIf I had seen Charles
Westall within the last half hour, I
should hardly presume to decide on so
delicate a point: he was but four years
old when I parted from him, of course I
only recollect him as a child. I have
been told however by some Virginians
who have visited the north that he is
the image of his father; if so, he has an
appearance that ladies usually honour
with their favourmanly, intelligent,
and expressive of every benevolent
affection.
Not one of your soft-amiable
gentle-zephyr
youths I hope, papa?they are
my aversion.
Not precisely; but if his face
resembles
his father's, it rather indicates a
natural taste for domestic life than for
the `shrill fife and spirit-stirring drum'
N 3
for the peace than the war
establishment
;
but I shall leave you to decide
on his beauty, Caroline, continued Mr.
Redwood, as he noticed a slight blush
on his daughter's cheek at what she
considered an allusion to her military
preference. `Is he clever?' is I think
the second question in the order of your
interrogatories; to this point I have the
most satisfactory testimonials: he has
received the first honours of the first
university in our countryhas finished
the study of the law with one of the
most eminent men at the north, and has
received the proposal of a most
advantageous
partnership with his instructor,
which he has just accepted.
Then if he is going into the
drudgery
of business, he is not rich of course,
papa?
No, Caroline, he is not rich,Mr.
Redwood was on the point of adding,
and of what consequence is that to
us? but he remembered in time, that it
was his policy to conceal from his
wayward
daughter his own views; and he
said, after a momentary pause, his
father's rash generosity impoverished his
estate. The father was an enthusiast,
Caroline; he thought as we all do of
the curse of slavery.
The curse of slavery? lord, papa,
what do you mean? there is no living
without slaves.
I fear, my child, that we shall find
there is no living with them; but
besides
the universal feeling in relation to
the evil of slavery, Westall's father had
some peculiar notions.During his life,
he gave to many of his slaves their
freedom
.
Oh shameful! exclaimed Caroline,
when every body allows, that all our
danger is from the freed slaves.
Westall endeavoured as far as
possible
to obviate that danger. He reserved
the noble gift for those who were
qualified
for it by some useful art, or a habit
of independent industry. At his death
he bequeathed their liberty to all who
remained on the plantation. This it
appears
he deemed not generous but just,
as he stated in his will, that in resigning
his property in them he merely restored
to them a natural right which they had
received from their Creator, and which
he had only withheld in the hope of
fitting them to enjoy it, but which he
would not leave in the power of any one
to detain from them.
What nonsense, papa; and so by
the indulgence of these whims he
beggared
poor Charles?
It cannot be denied that young
Westall's inheritance was impaired by
his father's singular, or it may be,
fanatical
notions of justice: for the value of
a southern plantation is graduated by
the number of its slaves, and without
them it is much in the condition of a
cart without a horse. There was no
hypocrisy in my friend's professed
dislike
of slavery; it was deep-rooted and
unconquerable, and to it he sacrificed
every pecuniary advantage. According
to the absolute provision of his will his
plantation was sold, and his widow and
son removed to the north. Charles's
fortune, though reduced, has been
adequate
to the expenses of a first-rate
education
;
he has inherited the
disinterestedness
of his father's spirit, for I find
that since coming of age he has vested
nearly all that remained of his property
in an annuity for his mother; he has a
few thousand dollars left to start with,
and as the `winds and waves are always
favourable to the ablest navigators,'
I do not doubt that his talents and
industry
will ensure him success. As to
his accomplishments, Caroline, you and
I affix probably different meanings to
the term, and therefore I will leave you
to satisfy your interrogatory on that
head after you shall have seen him.
Different meanings, papa; every
body knows what accomplished means
does he speak French? does he dance
well? Is he genteel and elegant, and
all that?
Oh perfectly genteel, my dear,
replied the father with a smile, he was
born and bred a gentleman, and has the
mind and spirit of a gentleman; he is, I
am told, approved by wise fathers,
courted by discreet mothers, and what
you will probably consider much more
unequivocal testimonythe favourite of
fair daughters. But, Caroline,
continued
Mr. Redwood, checking himself
from the fear that his daughter would
perceive his solicitude to secure her
favourable opinion of Westall, I think
your long confinement to the house has
robbed you of your bloom. The rumour
of your beauty has doubtless reached
the ears of my young friend, and I should
be sorry that your first appearance
should not answer his expectationsah,
there goes Miss Bruce on one of her
walking expeditions. Miss Bruce, he
added, speaking to Ellen through the
window, you are an absolute devotee
to naturewill you permit my daughter
to be the companion of your walk,
and show her some of the shrines at
which you worship?
I am only an admirer, not an
idolater
,
replied Ellen, smiling; and I
am certain, that if Miss Redwood will do
me the favour to accompany me, she
will answer for me that my homage is
reasonable. Miss Redwood readily
acquiesced in the arrangementthe wish
to restore her bloom was a controlling
motive; and the animating expectation
of the arrival of the Westalls had for
the moment made her forget her dislike
to Ellen: Lilly was summoned with
her hat and gloves, and the young ladies
proceeded arm in arm towards the lake.
What a delightful compensation we
have, said Ellen, for the suffering
from our long sultry summer days in the
reviving influence of the approaching
evening; its sweet cool breath refreshes
all nature, and restores elasticity and
vigour to mind and body.
You have, no doubt, an advantage
in your cool evenings, replied Caroline,
the only one, as far as I see, of the
north over the south.
Ellen suppressed her opinion
perhaps
partialthat her companion did
not see very far. I am not such a
bigot, said she, as to believe that your
country does not possess, in many
respects
,
the advantage over ours; but I
confess I have prejudices so strong in
favour of our lofty mountains, deep
valleys
,
and broad lakes, that I do not
believe
I should ever admire the tame
level of Carolina; but it is hardly
necessary
for me to be thus boastful while
this scene is itself so eloquently pleading
its claims to your admiration: look, Miss
Redwood, she continued, where the
lake reflects the bright tints of the
evening
sky, and there where the long
shadows
of the trees seem to sleep on its
bosomis there, can there be in the wide
world a lovelier spot than this?
It may be, replied Caroline, it is,
no doubt, exceedingly pretty; but to
own the truth to you, Miss Bruce, I can
never forget that this lake shore was the
scene of our disaster. After that
horrible
storm and fright it is natural it
should have no beauty in my eyes;
besides
,
you know, one that is not used to
the country gets so tired of it, that it is
quite impossible to admire it; but see,
she added, changing her languid tone to
one nearly as animated as Ellen's had
been: see, Miss Bruce, those beautiful
wild flowers that are growing there close
to the water's edge; I should so like to
get them to dress my hair against the
Westalls arrive: they would form a
beautiful contrast. I had a bunch of
snow-drops last winter that all the world
said were particularly becoming to me;
these flowers are as white and beautiful,
and being natural, they would have
quite a rural pretty effect.
A beautiful effect no doubt, Miss
Redwood, but alas! they are `not to be
come at by the willing hand;' if we had
the imagination of some poets, who are
fond of infusing their own sensations into
flowers, we might fancy these were
enjoying
their security, and laughing at
the vanity of your wishes.
But, said Caroline, it surely is
not impossible to get at them; and
espying a fisherman's canoe which was
fastened to a tree against which they
were standing, she proposed to Ellen,
who, she said, she was sure knew how to
guide it, to procure the flowers for her.
Indeed, Miss Redwood, replied
Ellen, I am no water-nymph, and
these canoes require as much skill to
guide them as the egg-shells in which
witches and fairies are said to traverse
the waters.
But, the water is not deep, insisted
Caroline, and if the worst happens, you
will but get your clothes wet, and you
have nothing on that can be injured.
The inexorable Ellen resisted this
argument, though Miss Redwood
enforced
it by a rapid glance of comparison
from Ellen's simple muslin frock to her
own richly trimmed silk dress.
There was an inlet of water where
the ladies stood, around which the
margin curved to the point where the
flowers grew at the base of a rock, and
so near the water's edge (for the earth
had been worn away by the surge) that
it could hardly be said from which
element
they sprung, earth or water. A
small birch tree had grown out of a cleft
in the rock, and was completely
overgrown
by a grape vine, which, after
embowering it, dropped its rich drapery
over the perpendicular side of the rock,
and hung there, in festoons so light and
graceful, that one might fancy they had
sportively peeped over the rock to look
at their beautiful image in the pure
mirror below. After Caroline's last
argument had failed, she jumped into
the canoe herself, and unhooking it from
the tree to which it was attached, she
exultingly exclaimed, nothing venture,
nothing have; and gaily pushed off
towards the object of her wishes.
The water was shallow, and
apparently
there was not the least danger.
Caroline, however, had given too
powerful
an impetus to the frail bark she was
guiding, and it struck against the rock
with so much force as to recoil with a
fluttering motion. Caroline was
frightened
,
and increased by her agitation the
irregular motion of the canoe; Ellen
perceived the dangerous operation of her
terrors, but before she could make her
comprehend that all that was necessary
was that she should sit down quietly,
Caroline had grasped the pendant vine
which was strong and tenacious, and the
canoe had passed from under her. It
drifted a few yards, and then remained
stationary at the base of the rock. The
rock was perpendicular, and too high
for Miss Redwood too reach its summit.
Ellen perceived, at a single glance, the
dilemma in which Caroline's fears had
involved her, and perceived and adopted
the only mode of extricating her from
her awkward situation. She ran around
the curve of the shore, ascended the
rock where the ascent was gradual, and
letting herself down as gently as
possible
into the canoe, she rowed
immediately
to the relief of the distressed
damsel, whose arms already trembled
with the weight which they sustained.
Oh, I am dead with fright! she
exclaimed
,
as soon as a certainty of
recovered
safety restored to her the use of
her tongue: for Heaven's sake tell
me, Ellen, how you got to me; I thought
you dropped from the skies. Ellen
explained that she had reached her by
natural and easy means. Well, said
Caroline, it was very goodvery kind
of you, and I nevernever shall forget
it; but pray get me back to the shore
for all the flowers in Paradise I would
not endure such another fright.
But we will not, said Ellen,
return
to the shore without a trophy for
your daring to venture to the only place
where even fear could create peril.
These flowers, she added, plucking
them, were the cause of all the
mischief
,
and they shall die for it.
She then rowed back to the shore,
and was tastefully arranging the flowers
in Caroline's hair, saying, at the same
time, that if she had made herself a
water-nymph, they would still have been
a fit coronal for her, when the
attention
of both the ladies was attracted by
the rapid approach of a gentleman
whom they perceived to be a stranger.
A frock coat and Madras cravat
announced
a traveller; and a brief glance
of Caroline's practised eye satisfied her
who it must be that so gracefully wore
this costumeand as he came up to
them she exclaimed, `Mr. Westall!' It
was Charles Westall conducted by little
Lucy Lenox. He courteously thanked
Miss Redwood for saving him from the
awkward necessity of introducing himself.
He had, as he said, just arrived at Mr.
Lenox's with his mother, and had been
sent by her with his little guide in quest
of Miss Redwood; that while
descending
the hill he had been a witness of Miss
Redwood's danger, and had hastened on
in the hope of being so fortunate as to assist
at her rescue; but fate had been unkind to
him, for the pleasure of playing the hero
on this occasion was not only wrested
from him, but he was forced to witness
and admire the celerity with which the
rescue had been effected without his
aid. Miss Redwood turned to
introduce
Ellen, but she had walked forward
with Lucy, who, with childish
eagerness
,
was telling her how frightened she
was when she saw her jump from the
rock, and that for a million Miss
Redwoods
she would not have had Ellen
run the risk of being drowned.
Never was there a happier moment
for the power of Miss Redwood's beauty.
The joy of recovered safety, and the
pleasure of surprise had deepened her
colour; her gratitude to Ellen had given
a touch of unwonted softness to her
expression
,
and the simple decoration of
the white flowers mingling with her
jet glossy curls, was far more beautiful
than their usually elaborate
arrangement
.
When the ceremony of introduction
to Mrs. Westall was over, and Caroline
with extraordinary animation had
expressed
her pleasure at the interview,
Mrs. Westall, impatient to ascertain
the first impression on her son,
whispered
,
Charles, is she as beautiful as
you expected?
As
beautiful, mother! you honour
my imagination too much; she is more
beautiful than any vision of my dull
brain.
For a few days after the arrival of
the Westalls the sands of time were
diamond sparks to the visitors at
Eton. Charles Westall and Caroline
Redwood seemed verging towards
that point of happy agreement so
much desired by both their parents
desired by Mr. Redwood, because his
experience had taught him that virtue
is the only basis of confidence or
happiness
,
and with an inconsistency not
uncommon
or surprising, he preferred that
virtue should be fortified by religious
principle
.
He had preserved an affectionate
recollection of Westall's father, and he
fancied that he was paying him a tribute
in giving to his son the noble fortune of
his own child, and when his conscience
whispered that the fortune was a poor
compensation for the incumbrance that
VOL. I. O
went with it, he found some consolation
in attributing Caroline's faults to the
bad influence of her grandmother, and
in the hope that, young as she was, her
character might be remoulded. All that
he had heard of Westall from the reports
of others, or had gathered from
occasional
correspondence with him, had
inspired regard for him; that regard
was now becoming affection. Charles
Westall's resemblance to his father
recalled to him the early and happiest
period of his life, that period when his
heart was light and fearless, and his
mind unclouded by the dark shadows
that a vain and false philosophy had since
cast upon it.
Mr. Redwood's apprehensions that
Captain Fitzgerald had taken such
possession
of his daughter's imagination as
to endanger the success of a rival
vanished
when he perceived that she
devoted
herself with characteristic
childishness
to the present object. Of the
happy result of her efforts to captivate
Charles Westall, he had no doubt; and
common experience would perhaps
justify
his conclusion that no young man
could resist the apparent preference of
a spirited young beauty with fortune
enough to atone for a thousand faults.
A superficial observation satisfied him
that he was secure of Mrs. Westall's
influence for his daughter; he perceived
that the progress of time had not
diminished
the worldliness of disposition
which his sagacity had detected even
when it was sheltered by the charms of
youth.
Mrs. Westall was one of those ladies
who are universal favourites: her face
was pleasing, her person graceful, and
her manners courteous; with these
medium
charms, she attracted attention
without provoking envy; she had no
strong holds in her mind for prejudice
or austere principle. She was one of
that large class who take their form and
pressure from the society in which they
happen to be cast;a thorough
conformist
.
In our eastern country, she was,
if not strict, quite exact in her religious
observances. She would have preferred
the lenient bosom of episcopacy, because
of its agreeable medium between the
latitudinarians and the puritans, and
perhaps
too on account of its superior
gentility
.
But as her location in a country
town precluded the privilege of choice,
she offered an edifying example, by
quietly waiting on the services of a
congregational
meeting every Sunday, and
occasionally attending a lecture or a
conference during the week. She
contributed to the utmost limit of her
ability to the good and religious objects
that engage the zeal and affections of our
community. This virtuous conduct was
more the effect of imitation than of
independent
opinion; for Mrs. Westall,
with the resources of fortune, and in
fashionable life, had remonstrated with
some
energy (she was not capable of
much) against the strictness and
enthusiasm
of her husband. If again restored
to the world, she would without an
effort have conformed to its usages, and
endured
the excesses of genteel
dissipation
.
In one of our cities she might
have held Sunday evening levees, or in
Paris have strolled out the day of holy
rest in the public gardens, or forgotten
it at the opera, or a fashionable card
party.
How such a woman could interest
Edmund Westall, those only
ought
to
inquire who have never observed how
much early attachments are controlled
by local, and (as it seems) purely
accidental
circumstances. Westall, during
his college life, resided in the family of
his wife's parents. He was captivated
by the sweetness of her temper and the
simplicity of her manners; he trusted
for the rest with the facility of youthful
love, that hopes, believes, and expects
all things. He did not live long enough
to awake from the lover's dream, though
he occasionally saw a trait of
worldliness
which he imputed to the humble
circumstances in which his wife had
been bred, thinking that they (as they
often do) had led her to an undue
estimation
of the advantages of wealth,
rank, and fashion. Westall was deemed
an enthusiast, and perhaps he was so, for
his interest in the happiness of others
often led him to a singular forgetfulness
of himself, and his means were
sometimes
inadequate to effect his benevolent
and philanthropic plans. Like other
enthusiasts, he was apt to forget that the
materials he had to work with were
sordid
and earthly; and, like them, he was
compelled to endure the ridicule of those
base spirits that were making idols of
their silver and their gold, while he was
on the Mount in the service of the living
God. Charles Westall was four years
old when he lost his parent: the
recollections
he preserved of him were like
the glimpse a saint has of heaven in
his dreams. He remembered being led
by him to the cabins of his infirm or sick
slaves, and some particulars of his
humane
attentions to them. He recollected
the melting tenderness of his eye and the
tone of his voice when he had
commended
him for a kind action. But his
most vivid impression was of the last
moment of his father's life, when he had
laid his hand upon his child's head, and
in the act of resigning him, had
fervently
prayed that he might be kept
unspotted from the world. Charles
could not then comprehend the full
import
of the words; but afterwards,
amidst the temptations of life, he felt
their efficacy. At an early period his
mother had given into his possession his
father's private papers. Through them
he came to an intimate knowledge of
his father's characterof his many
virtuous
efforts and sacrificesof his hopes
and fears in relation to himselfof his
deepest and holiest feelings; thus the
son was admitted into the sanctuary of
the father's heart, and held, as it were, a
spiritual communion with him. From
these precious documents, Charles
Westall
realized all that has been hoped from
the ministry of a guardian spirit; they
became a kind of external conscience to
him; saving him from many an error
into which the buoyant careless spirit of
youth might otherwise have betrayed
him. Few living parents exert such an
influence over the character of a child.
END OF VOL. I.
LONDON:
SHACKELL AND ARROWSMITH, JOHNSON'S-COURT, FLEET-STREET.Some months have elapsed, dear
Alsop, since we parted, and parted with
a truly juvenile promise to keep up
an unremitting epistolary intercourse.
And this I believe is the first essay made
by either of us; a fair illustration of the
common proportion which performance
bears to such promises. You, no doubt,
have been roving from pleasure to
pleasure
,
with an untiring impulse, and your
appetite, like the horse-leech, has still
cried, `give, give.' If one of your
vagrant thoughts has strayed after me,
you have doubtless fancied me immured
in my study, pursuing my free inquiries,
abandoning the fallen systems of vulgar
invention, and soaring far over the
misty atmosphere of imposture and
credulity
.
Or, perhaps, you deem that I
have adopted your sapient advice, have
returned to my home a dutiful child,
gracefully worn the chains of filial
obedience
,
made my best bow to papa, and
with a, `just as you please, Sir,' fallen,
secundum artem, desperately in love
with my beautiful, and beautifully rich
cousin; have rather taken than asked
her willing hand, and thus opened for
myself the path of ambition, or the
golden gates that lead to the regions of
pleasure, and which none but fortune's
hand can open, But, alas! the most
reasonable hopes are disappointed by
our fantastic destiny. We are the sport
of chance; and as we confess no other
deity, you are bound not to deride any
of the whimsical dilemmas into which
his votaries are led. Alsop, you have
often commended the boldness of my
mind, while you laughed at a certain
involuntary homage I paid to the
beautiful
pictures of goodness, which some
dreaming enthusiasts have presented to
us, or to the moral beauty which among
all the varieties of accidental
combination
,
is sometimes exhibited in real
life.
Have I prepared you to hear the
confession that I am at this present
moment the blind and willing dupe of
goodness, (I mean what the moralists
call goodness,) embodied in a form that
might soften a stoic, convert an infidel,
or perform any other miracle.
You have heard me make
honourable
mention of my friend Westall.
He is by some years my elder, three or
four at least. I think I never related
the circumstances of our introduction
to each other; I am quite certain I did
not, for you would have laughed at
them; they may now serve to elucidate
to you my friend's character, and to
account for our early and reciprocal
interest.
My father had among his servants
a native African; one of those men
whom nature has endowed with a giant
frame, and correspondent qualities of
mind. At the time my father purchased
him, he was separated from his wife
and two children, girls; the only boy
my father purchased with him, whether
because he thought the presence of the
child would help to keep the father in
heart, or from a transient feeling of
compassion for the poor wretch, I know
not. The wife had suffered deplorably
from the voyage, and was knocked
down with her two girls to a Georgian
for a trifle. You do not know my
father: suffice it to say, that selfishness
and habit have made him quite insensible
to the sufferings of these poor devils,
whom he classes with other brutes born
for our service. But there was
something
extraordinary in the strong
affections
and unconquerable temper of this
man. His wife and little ones were
torn from his strong grasp, and when
resistance was hopeless, and he turned
from them, the large muscles of his
neck swelled almost to bursting, and
he set up a desperate howl, that made
every heart quake or melt. Some one
of the throng around him, put his boy
into his arms: the sight of him changed
the current of his feelings; he soon
became silent, and, a few moments after,
his tears fell thick and heavy on the
child. My father brought him home.
He performed his appointed tasks well,
but he was retired and sulky, and the
smallest services that were imposed on
his child seemed to exasperate his spirit.
It was not many months after he came
into our possession, that our overseer,
a cruel worthless dog, beat the child
who had unwarily offended him,
unmercifully
.
The father interposed and
rescued
the child at the expense of some
cutting lashes on his own back, which
he seemed to regard no more than the
idle wind. The very night after, the
child disappeared, and it was believed
the unhappy father had put an end to
the boy's life. The fact was never
ascertained, though no one doubted it;
for as you will readily believe my
father was not very zealous to establish
a truth which would have deprived him
of one of his most valuable slaves. These
circumstances transpired before I was
old enough to remember them; but
when I first heard the report of them
among our domestic annals, I felt an
involuntary respect for this man, who
with a spirit more noble than Cato's,
cut the cord that bound his son to
captivity
,
and manfully continued to
endure the galling of his own chains.
Was not this a glorious illustration of
the truth of our old friend Seneca's
remark, that `sometimes to live is
magnanimity?'
Time passed on, but Africk (for
that was the name my father had given
him,) remained unaltered. I think I
see him now, going to his daily task,
always apart from the herd, and quite
alone; his firm and slow step, the
curling
of his lip, which would have better
become a monarch than a slave, and his
fixed downcast eye.
His mind, which like adamant had
resisted the influence of time, was at last
subdued by fanaticism, which you know,
like some chemical powers, will dissolve
substances that no chemical force can
impress. My father (a little alarmed
himself, as I suspect, by an eloquent
harangue,) permitted a zealous
Methodist
or Moravian, I am not certain which,
but a member of one of these tribes of
amiable madmen, to address his people.
A great sensation was produced, and
among the rest, Africk eagerly seized
every opportunity of communication
with the preacher. He had never
before
sought human communion or
sympathy
.
He soon became a convert; his
fierce manner was changed to
gentleness
;
he no longer avoided his fellows;
and though still reserved and silent, it
seemed to me that his religion brought
him back to the human family, and by
uniting him to the common Father of
all, restored the broken links of
fraternity
.
Whether his faith had an enfeebling
influence on his body as well as his
mind, I know not; but his health fell
into decay. The overseer complained
that he kept long vigils after his daily
labour; that he spent the nights which
were made to prepare him for his labour,
in prayers that exhausted his spirits and
his strength. My father inquired of
Buckley if he had used the whip; the
wretch replied, that he never entered a
complaint till that remedy had failed,
It did no more good, he said, to whip
him, than to beat the air; he bore it
without complaint, and without
shrinking
.
My father then recommended an
abatement of Africk's daily food.
That, Buckley said, he had tried
till the rascal was so weak he could
scarcely stand. I was present at this
conference, and my nature rebelled
against the intolerable oppression the
poor wretch was suffering. I
interposed
,
and entreated my father to adopt
kind treatment.
He swore at my boyish
impertinence
,
as he called it; but it was not,
however, without effect, for he
recommended
to Buckley milder usage. But
the fellow's habits of cruelty were too
firmly fixed for any essential change.
It was not long after that Africk
interposed
to rescue a female slave from the
horrible lash of this tyrant: his fury,
averted from the woman, fell with
redoubled
violence on Africk, till no
longer stimulated by resistance, he
turned
away from his silent victim, and left
him to crawl (for he could not walk)
to his little cabin. The following
morning he was missing; the
plantation
was searched in vain, and I was
despatched by my father in quest of
him, as he deemed it probable that some
of the negroes of our neighbours might
have harboured and concealed him;
these sort of courtesies being not
unfrequent
among our slaves.
I went, but with the determination
never to reveal, if I discovered his
concealment
,
and to afford him every aid
in my power, for my youthful
imagination
had been powerfully excited by his
heroism and his sufferings, and neither
philosophy nor experience had yet
steeled my heart against the spectacle
of human misery. Would to God they
never had!
I began my expedition on foot,
being just then inspired with a passion
to emulate the feats of some European
pedestrians, of whom I had heard. I
cannot remember a period of my life
when some such whim did not rule the
hour. I had entered on Mr. Westall's
grounds, and in order to cross by a
straight line to the cabins of the negroes,
I left the circuitous road, and turned
into some low ground, covered with
pines. It soon became marshy, and
almost impassable, but I had proceeded
too far for retreat or extrication, and I
continued to push forward through the
snarled bushes and interwoven branches
of the trees; the daylight and my
strength were almost exhausted, and my
patience entirely, when I perceived the
ground harden to my tread, and pressing
eagerly forward, I issued from the wood
into an open space, a few roods in
circumference
,
around which the trees
grew so thick, that they formed an
almost
impenetrable wall, a natural
defence
for this sequestered retreat. To
my amazement I saw before me, and
just on the skirt of the wood, a rudely
constructed hut; two of its sides were
formed by slabs resting on the ground
at one end, meeting at the top, and
supported by poles inserted into two
notched posts; the third side was filled
by brush cut from the adjoining wood,
and piled loosely together; the fourth,
towards which I advanced, was quite
open to the weather.
Alsop, I had proceeded thus far in
my narrative, when I threw down my
pen; my fancy had restored me to this
scene of my youth; I had insensibly
reverted to the influences that then
governed my mind, and I felt that I
was exposing the offices of the temple to
the derision of the unbelievers. I protest
against your laugh, and your more
intolerable
ridicule: I know all these things
are the illusions of youth and
ignorance
,
but I sometimes think them better,
certainly far happier, than the realities
I have since adopted. Still vacillating,
you say between philosophy and
superstition
!
amiable
superstition! I have
described this spot with some
particularity
.
It is, with all its
accompaniments
,
indelibly stamped on my memory.
As I said, I advanced towards the
habitation
,
and unperceived by its occupants,
I had leisure to observe and to listen to
them. Africk was lying extended on
some straw with which the ground (for
there was no floor) had been strewn for
this slight accommodation; his head
was supported by an old negro woman;
with one hand he grasped the hand of my
friend, with the other he held firmly a
saphie, which was suspended around his
neck; his short and spasmodic
breathing
indicated the last feeble struggle
with death.
Edmund Westall knelt beside him,
and might have been mistaken for a
bright vision from another and a higher
sphere, so beautiful was the combination
of faith, hope, and charity, as the
enthusiast
paints them, in his fair and
innocent
face. The last rays of the setting
sun entering an aperture in the
wall, fell athwart his brow, burnished
his light brown hair, and rested there,
a bright halo, which seemed the seal of
the celestial ministry. My ear caught
the broken sentence of the dying man.
`No no,' he said; `Mr. Edmund, I
had no peace. I would have given my
life for one moment of freedom. I
looked for revenge. I thought of my
wife and my little ones; and I could
have poured out the blood of white men,
till it should run like the big waters
over which they brought us. But the
voice of God pierced to my heart;
and I was an altered man. And when
I prayed that blessed prayer, that I
might be forgiven even as I forgive
others, the fire in my heart was quenched,
and the terrible storm that had raged
here (and he pressed Edmund's hand
on his naked breast) was laid; and there
was peace, Mr. Edmund; God's peace.
I was a slave, and I was wretched, but
the sting was taken away. Do not
pray for me, nor for mine. I have been
on my knees for my helpless ones, night
after night, and all night long, and my
prayer is heard. But pray for your
father's land, and your father's children.
Pray to be saved from the curse that is
coming. Oh! (he exclaimed,) and his
voice became stronger, and his deep
tones seemed to bear to our ears the
sure words of prophecy; oh, I hear the
cry of revenge; I hear the wailings of
your wives and your little ones; and I
see your fair lands drenched with their
blood. Pray to God to save you in that
day, for it will surely come.' His voice
was spent; his eyes closed, as I believed
for ever, and I sprang towards the bed.
I then perceived that it was a
momentary
exhaustion; he still grasped
Edmund's
hand, and I noticed the feeble
beatings of his heart. The old woman
signed to me to withdraw from before
him; and I silently took my station
beside her. After a few moments, he
again languidly opened his eyes and
said, in a scarcely audible voice, `I
thought I was in my own land; and I
heard the rustling of our leaves, and the
voices of my kindred, and I was feeding
my little ones with their kouskous as
when the destroyers came. My spirit
will pass easier, if I hear the voice of
your prayer, blessed young man. Pray
for my master; for Buckley.' He paused;
and Edmund, in a low tender voice,
began his supplication. At the close of
each petition Africk murmured amen;
VOL. I. E
and at Edmund's fervent intercession
for his oppressors, he opened his eyes,
clasped his hands and in the intensity
of his feeling, half rose from the straw.
The effort exhausted him; he sunk
back on the breast of the old woman,
and expired. She released herself from
him, and then stretching her arms
towards
Heaven, as if in acknowledgment
to Him who had broken the bonds of
Africk's captivity, she clapped her hands
and shouted, `he is free! he is free!'
Edmund and I laid our faces together
on the straw beside the poor negro,
and wept as youth is wont to do.
Forgive me, Alsop, I have told you
a very long, and it may be a very dull
story, though I think not; for nothing
is dull to you that is connected with the
philosophy of the human mind. You
will ridicule me for ever having deemed
of importance the particulars of a vulgar
being, extinct after a few years of life,
and that for the most part passed in
abject slavery; but like a true
philosopher
,
you will with me eagerly explore
the past for the causes that have
influenced
my character and governed my
destiny. And yet, `poor play things
of unpitying fate,' why should we be
so anxious to penetrate the mysteries
of a being which may cease for ever
to-morrow? The epicureans were more
consistent than we are; and we may
learn from the author of a faith that we
deride, the truest wisdom for us; `let
us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.'
This scene has haunted my
imagination
:
the memory of it has sometimes
seemed to me like a voice from Heaven;
for a long while it kept alive a dying
spark of faith. I cherished it as a
testimony
,
that God had not left the
creatures
he had formed to wander without
him in the world: I fancied there was
a supernatural ministry to the spirit of
this much-injured man, that had
converted
his just and unrelenting hatred
to forgivenesshis pride to
submissiveness
and
there seemed a witness to the
E 2
mercy of Heaven in the gentle and
tender
countenance of my friend.
Yes, Alsop, I confess itthe
memory
of this scene has sometimes been an
impassable barrier to your infidel and
most ingenious arguments.
You know one of the boldest, as
well as one of the most charming of
female sceptics, said, `in the silence of
the closet, or the dryness of discussion, I
can agree with the atheist or the
materialist
,
as to the insolubility of certain
questions; but when in the country, or
contemplating nature, my soul, full of
emotion, soars aloft to the vivifying
principle that animates them, to the
almighty intellect that pervades them,
and to the goodness that makes the scene
so delightful to my senses!'
Thus it is with me: nature and the
beautiful traits of nature we sometimes
see in man, appeal irresistibly to my
feelings, and force their way to my
convictions
.
My purpose was, frankly to tell you
my present embarrassments; but I have
been led into too serious a train of
feeling
to proceed any farther, and certainly
to let you into the arcana of my present
perplexities.
I explained to Edmund my
intentions
in regard to Africk. We found
that we had participated in a strong
feeling of compassion towards him,
and this sympathy at once created
a bond of union between us. This
hiding-place had been contrived by
Westall's people for a refuge for the
runaways from the neighbouring
plantations
;
not at all for their own benefit,
for the conduct of the Westalls to their
slaves was noted for its benevolent and
paternal character. The retreat was
kept secret from Mr. Westall, (the
father;) for the negroes rightly
concluded
that he would have been
compelled
in honour to surrender, as the
property of his neighbours, the refugees
who took shelter there. The son had
been conducted to the place by the old
woman, who was his nurse, who knew
she might safely confide the secret to
his custody, and who could not believe
that any case was so desperate that he
could not bring some alleviation to it.
We agreed that Africk's body should
be conveyed during the night to the
cabin of one of the negroes, and should
in the morning be restored to my father.
Before we parted from the remains
of the released slave, we examined the
saphie, which to his last breath, he had
so pertinaciously grasped. You must
know these saphies, are boxes made of
horn, shell, or some other durable mate
rial; they contain some charon, usually
a sentence from the Koran, which serves
as an amulet to keep off evil spirits.
Africk had changed the object of his
superstition, and the infidel charm had
been expelled to give place to the
following
sentence, written at his request
by Westall: `Forgive me my trespasses,
even as I forgive those who trespass
against me.'
At Edmund's instigation, I made
this the occasion of benefit to the other
negroes. I applied to my father in their
behalf, and found my way to his
understanding
by the sure and well-trodden
path of selfishness. I convinced him
that Buckley's cruelty had shortened
Africk's life, and that the tyrant's
harsh treatment of the slaves
prevented
half the profit that might
otherwise be derived from their
labour
.
My father, exasperated by his
recent loss, readily yielded to my
arguments
.
Buckley was dismissed, and an
efficient and tolerably humane overseer
employed in his place. I possessed then,
Alsop, some enthusiasm in the cause of
benevolence, and could have envied, and
possibly might have emulated the fame
of a Howard. But notwithstanding
this strange confession, you need not
now despair of your disciple and friend,
H.
Redwood
.Dear Alsop
,
I am grateful for your interest, and
convinced by your arguments that I
ought no longer to doze away my brief
existence in this retirement. I have
obtained
my father's consent to the
arrangement
you propose; and what is still
more indispensable, an ample supply in
consideration of a promise I have given
to him, that I will solicit the hand of my
cousin immediately after my return.
Alsop, I find it necessary to
recollect
all the arguments in favour of
virtue and vice being only conventional
terms, artificial contrivances for man's
convenience; for conscience, conscience,
`that blushing shame-faced spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom,' tells me that
if it is not so, I am the veriest wretch
alive. I am married to a young creature
without fortune, without connexions;
innocent, and beautiful, and
religious;
an odd union, is it not? I have not
intimated
my free opinions to her, for why
should I disturb her superstition? It is
quite becoming to a woman, harmonizes
well with the weakness of her sex, and
is perhaps necessary to it. No one but
the priest (and he is trust-worthy) knows
our secret. My pride, my ambition,
rebel against the humble condition of
life to which this rash indulgence of
boyish passion condemns me. If my
father knew it, he would spurn me; for
my marriage disappoints his favourite
E 3
project, and my poor girl would
provoke
his most inveterate prejudices;
and my mother, my timid mother,
would never forgive me for presuming
to offend my father: there is no
tolerable
alternative; the fact must be
concealed
for the present. Who knows
but one of the tides, which, `taken at
the flood lead on to fortune,' may await
me? any thing is better than to lose
this bright opportunity of pleasure and
advantage. Poor Westall is dead, and
died with unbroken confidence in my
virtue. Is goodness thus credulous? He
has committed his only son, a boy of
four years, to my guardianship. I will
not betray his trust, so help me God.
Yours, &c.
H. R.
